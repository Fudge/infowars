[00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:11.666]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:13.988]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.576 --> 00:00:27.780]  This is what it looks like when in the rare event the United States votes in a populist president.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.583]  And that president begins the uphill battle of mending the fabric of the U.S.
[00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:38.727]  Constitution, torn apart by puppets installed by an embedded foreign globalist system.
[00:00:38.887 --> 00:00:41.009]  Would you ever have Donald Trump on your show?
[00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.089]  No.
[00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.870]  What if he asked you?
[00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.490]  No.
[00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:45.331]  What about Melania?
[00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:46.292]  Would you have her on your show?
[00:00:46.352 --> 00:00:46.912]  Melania?
[00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:47.913]  To talk about what?
[00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:48.954]  She can barely speak English.
[00:00:49.767 --> 00:01:07.255]  Of course, the brainwashing social engineering media minions have their claws so deeply dug into the psychological soil of the nation that the legalized propaganda quietly enacted in 2013 under President Obama will not stop.
[00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:15.139]  No matter how diligently, the Trump administration refutes the lamestream media's alternative facts.
[00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:17.641]  You know, I have a running war with the media.
[00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:21.323]  They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth.
[00:01:22.864 --> 00:01:29.168]  And they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community.
[00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:34.691]  And I just want to let you know, the reason you're number one stop, uh, it is exactly the opposite.
[00:01:34.932 --> 00:01:35.652]  Exactly.
[00:01:35.732 --> 00:01:36.913]  And they understand that too.
[00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:38.574]  Think about how dumb they think you are.
[00:01:40.677 --> 00:01:42.938]  CNN actually put out this gigapixel photograph of the inauguration.
[00:01:42.978 --> 00:01:44.639]  They debunked themselves on that crowd size.
[00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.139]  You can go to it and see how huge the crowd was.
[00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.780]  We had a tweet go out about Martin Luther King.
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.141]  Think about how racially charged that is.
[00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:19.136]  And someone rushes out and says to the entire press corps that the President of the United States has removed the bus from his office.
[00:02:20.797 --> 00:02:25.219]  Do you, I mean, think about what this signal, hold on, please.
[00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.501]  He actually apprised to quote my colleagues.
[00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:29.302]  That's the exact quote.
[00:02:30.512 --> 00:02:34.655]  Okay, that quote, that report got tweeted out around.
[00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:38.557]  And to report, where was the apology to the President of the United States?
[00:02:39.257 --> 00:02:44.961]  Where was the apology to millions of people who read that and thought how racially insensitive that was?
[00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:48.323]  But the first time he confronts the public?
[00:02:49.747 --> 00:02:50.488]  It's a falsehood?
[00:02:50.768 --> 00:02:57.913]  Chuck, I mean, if we're going to keep referring to our press secretary in those types of terms, I think that we're going to have to rethink our relationship here.
[00:02:58.253 --> 00:03:00.775]  But look what happened the day before, talking about falsehoods.
[00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:08.521]  When we allow the press in, and what happens almost immediately, a falsehood is told about removing the bust of Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:03:08.541 --> 00:03:09.181]  from the Oval Office.
[00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:11.043]  No, that's just flat-out false.
[00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:14.805]  If it wasn't obvious before, it has to be now.
[00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:39.161]  Any rational American can plainly see President Donald J. Trump has hit the ground running into his first 100 days and already has a 57% approval rating, according to Rasmussen polls, compared to the king of the snowflakes and the fascist and racist leftist Barack Obama, who, after eight years of unyieldingly wounding the republic,
[00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:45.086]  Had an average approval rating of 47.9% according to a Gallup poll.
[00:03:45.226 --> 00:03:50.110]  We have to accept that there is prejudice that exists within our own party.
[00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.152]  And we have to be able to have the conversation.
[00:03:54.113 --> 00:03:57.594]  And my job is to shut other white people down when they want to interrupt.
[00:03:58.334 --> 00:04:04.776]  My job is to shut other white people down when they want to say, oh no, I'm not prejudiced.
[00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:06.057]  I'm a Democrat.
[00:04:06.177 --> 00:04:06.917]  I'm accepting.
[00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:12.499]  My job is to make sure that they get, that they have privilege.
[00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:23.642]  And until we shut our mouths, and we listen to those people who don't, and we lift our people up so that we all have equity in this country.
[00:04:24.022 --> 00:04:36.775]  As CNS News reports, that puts him behind Richard Nixon, who resigned, and George W. Bush, who saw his approval rating drop as low as 25% near the end of his term.
[00:04:36.955 --> 00:04:42.741]  When the history books are written, the only change former President Barack Obama brought
[00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:56.364]  ...was a growth of the awareness to the bulk of the American people that the system and the talking heads protecting that system are far more corrupt and desperate than we initially realized.
[00:04:56.684 --> 00:05:08.707]  John Bound for InfoWars.com This has been adopted as of 2017 by the Department of Defense.
[00:05:08.947 --> 00:05:10.368]  All four branches of the military.
[00:05:11.028 --> 00:05:11.908]  Combat One.
[00:05:12.947 --> 00:05:20.768]  And guess who in the spring of 2017 has the exclusive right to sell this to everybody else?
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.081]  But the military.
[00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:25.502]  Infowars.com.
[00:05:26.163 --> 00:05:29.745]  I want to commend Q and Patrick and the rest of our team.
[00:05:29.785 --> 00:05:33.027]  I want to commend Combat One for getting the big Pentagon deal.
[00:05:33.647 --> 00:05:36.409]  And I want to thank them for supporting us because they know we support America.
[00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:50.237]  We are the exclusive source of Combat One Skin and Muscle Optimization Field Foam, Field Spray Skin and Muscle Optimization, and Broad Spectrum Hygiene Tactical Bath
[00:05:50.797 --> 00:05:52.638]  Contains eight pre-moistened cloths.
[00:05:53.278 --> 00:06:03.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are incredibly affordable and they have patented proprietary systems that annihilate germs, you name it, across the board.
[00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:08.442]  That's why it's been adopted by the Pentagon, by the Defense Department, system-wide.
[00:06:08.482 --> 00:06:15.384]  I'm going to go over some of the numbers, some of the proven statistics and the claims that Combat One can make right now.
[00:06:16.204 --> 00:06:25.253]  Never before has the public been able to access this new Combat One military-grade hygiene technology used by special operations to maintain hygiene during survival situations.
[00:06:25.613 --> 00:06:27.715]  Studied for safety and effectiveness by St.
[00:06:27.775 --> 00:06:29.837]  John's Medical Research Institute, St.
[00:06:29.897 --> 00:06:37.644]  Jude's, and the American Journal of Infection Control, the technology behind Combat One wipes kills bad bacteria while leaving beneficial
[00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:39.826]  Skin bacteria unharmed.
[00:06:39.926 --> 00:06:40.966]  That's the key buffer.
[00:06:41.227 --> 00:06:45.949]  The toxic wipes, the sanitizers kill everything, including your immune system.
[00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:46.910]  They lower your fertility.
[00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:47.470]  It's all admitted.
[00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.352]  Combat One is able to do this naturally by only targeting the bad stuff.
[00:06:51.812 --> 00:06:52.713]  And again, it's all patented.
[00:06:52.733 --> 00:06:53.973]  It's super secret.
[00:06:54.134 --> 00:06:55.814]  12 years, Special Forces testing it.
[00:06:56.395 --> 00:07:01.798]  This is something every info warrior needs to order, needs to have in their home, needs to use in their daily lives.
[00:07:02.118 --> 00:07:05.700]  Whether it's cleaning your guns or your own skin, or when you're out camping,
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.502]  This is the game changer.
[00:07:07.542 --> 00:07:12.648]  The entire family of Combat One is available exclusively at m4warstore.com.
[00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:16.994]  Just coming back from the river where I was using one of our water filtration straws.
[00:07:17.595 --> 00:07:19.916]  A certain device we sell here at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:07:20.617 --> 00:07:25.020]  And I had to smack my knuckle pretty hard the other day with my knife after cleaning one of the animals.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.984]  So I'm going to use some Combat One foam to show you guys that we actually use it, how well it works.
[00:07:32.005 --> 00:07:34.147]  This wound's been open for about five days now.
[00:07:34.907 --> 00:07:36.448]  I just dipped it in and out of the river.
[00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:38.830]  So just to be on our safe and sorry.
[00:07:48.266 --> 00:07:51.648]  Once I let that soak in, I'll wrap it up, feel dressed nice and clean again.
[00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:55.231]  And it certainly is coming to the rescue with Combat One.
[00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:56.712]  Born in America.
[00:07:57.152 --> 00:07:58.053]  Made in America.
[00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:01.135]  And now distributed by InfoWars to America.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.906]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:15.307 --> 00:08:16.811]  Because there is a war on.
[00:08:17.273 --> 00:08:18.176]  For your mind.
[00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:36.378]  They're intentionally leaving the borders open in Europe, bringing in mass refugees, among them are going to be jihadists, who are setting up a future Tet Offensive, Tet-style offensive, in Europe.
[00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.099]  And the same thing's being done to this country.
[00:08:38.579 --> 00:08:48.986]  On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.121]  His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.
[00:08:55.641 --> 00:08:56.722]  Oh well, she cried.
[00:08:57.202 --> 00:08:57.982]  I'll take you in.
[00:08:58.422 --> 00:08:59.542]  And I'll take care of you.
[00:09:00.683 --> 00:09:02.143]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:09:02.703 --> 00:09:04.143]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[00:09:04.624 --> 00:09:06.184]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:09:07.244 --> 00:09:09.865]  Sighed the vicious snake.
[00:09:11.865 --> 00:09:13.926]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:09:14.386 --> 00:09:15.826]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[00:09:16.687 --> 00:09:18.167]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[00:09:19.209 --> 00:09:21.970]  Beside the vicious snake.
[00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.711]  Now she clutched him to her bosom.
[00:09:26.171 --> 00:09:28.032]  You're so beautiful, she cried.
[00:09:28.832 --> 00:09:33.133]  But if I hadn't brought you in by now, you might have died.
[00:09:34.213 --> 00:09:39.255]  She stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight.
[00:09:40.322 --> 00:09:47.405]  But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[00:09:48.385 --> 00:09:52.266]  I saved you, cried the woman, and you've bit me.
[00:09:52.646 --> 00:09:53.727]  Heavens, why?
[00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:59.209]  You know your bite is poisonous, and now I'm going to die.
[00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:04.290]  Oh, shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:07.972]  You knew damn well I was a snake.
[00:10:08.737 --> 00:10:10.378]  Before you took me in!
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:19.063]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:10:21.605 --> 00:10:26.508]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're wondering what's happening in this country, it is simply the return of America.
[00:10:27.609 --> 00:10:35.854]  The globalists had a bold plan to hijack every sovereign nation on Earth, and then basically steal their resources for a planned world government.
[00:10:36.792 --> 00:10:38.893]  A very oppressive planned world government.
[00:10:39.273 --> 00:10:43.195]  They were so arrogant, they wrote white papers, they gave speeches, they wrote books about it.
[00:10:44.275 --> 00:10:59.281]  And so, myself and many others in the last few decades went and compiled those articles, those speeches, and those interviews from television, C-SPAN, you name it, and showed the world, and made films, and wrote our own books, and built our own media.
[00:11:00.165 --> 00:11:07.108]  They just sat there arrogantly laughing at us over and over again when we had the facts, we had the culture.
[00:11:09.049 --> 00:11:11.330]  And now they're not laughing anymore, are they?
[00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.570]  No?
[00:11:12.486 --> 00:11:17.770]  They're screaming for blood, they're screaming for civil war, they're screaming for death.
[00:11:18.731 --> 00:11:22.814]  Let's go to DrudgeReport.com that I've got here on screen today.
[00:11:23.495 --> 00:11:30.500]  Drudge just always has the perfect way to put it all, put it all down so simply, but also in a complex way.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.582]  Dow Jones roars past 20,000.
[00:11:35.558 --> 00:11:39.281]  That's $1,300,000,000,000 in since he was elected November 8th.
[00:11:39.582 --> 00:11:42.124]  Let's look down, though, in the left-hand corner.
[00:11:42.564 --> 00:11:45.127]  Peter Thiel, one foot out of the USA.
[00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:50.411]  Wealthy Americans fear impending civil war, evacuating to New Zealand.
[00:11:51.352 --> 00:11:52.793]  I've been telling people that for eight years.
[00:11:52.833 --> 00:11:53.714]  Now it's all admitted.
[00:11:54.135 --> 00:11:55.175]  Let me tell you where else they're going.
[00:11:55.195 --> 00:11:56.497]  They're going to Kauai.
[00:11:59.949 --> 00:12:17.018]  The most westerly and most northerly Hawaiian island, one of the most remote, where they filmed Jurassic Park and King Kong, and Zuckerberg is suing hundreds of Hawaiians trying to take their land.
[00:12:19.479 --> 00:12:22.601]  Isn't that just cute to build his giant mansion?
[00:12:26.101 --> 00:12:40.252]  Hawaiians call Mark Zuckerberg the face of neocolonialism over land lawsuits, but notice he's the one screaming Black Lives Matter and funding it and pushing the race war, while he himself, just like the UN does, goes in and takes people's property!
[00:12:44.135 --> 00:12:50.400]  That's how they operate, and believe me, he's building an armored fortress out in San Francisco around his house, that's admitted.
[00:12:52.287 --> 00:12:53.067]  He wants walls.
[00:12:53.107 --> 00:12:54.167]  You know, I want to put a meme out.
[00:12:54.187 --> 00:13:02.289]  I mean, we did this last year and Trump picked up on it and others did, but where we show the Great Wall of China, we say it's okay for them to have one.
[00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:03.670]  Not racist.
[00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.971]  And then right next to it, we have Mexico's border fence and wall.
[00:13:08.071 --> 00:13:09.831]  Mexico, not racist, not a problem.
[00:13:11.912 --> 00:13:17.573]  And then we can also show, again, many other walls that other governments and other groups have, like the Vatican.
[00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:19.634]  Some of their walls are 200 feet tall.
[00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:20.754]  The average is about 50 feet.
[00:13:20.794 --> 00:13:21.194]  I've been there.
[00:13:23.598 --> 00:13:31.550]  And then next to it show the little spindly fences we've got in a few spots and say, racist!
[00:13:32.871 --> 00:13:37.017]  Again, it's the total mind control of this.
[00:13:40.697 --> 00:13:43.158]  And that's just Zuckerberg building his wall out in Kauai.
[00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:46.739]  That's nothing on his 700 acres while he's trying to grab more.
[00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:52.921]  He's got a big wall in San Francisco and is buying up all the surrounding neighborhood to bulldoze it and turn it into his own compound.
[00:13:53.241 --> 00:14:04.144]  And we get the fact you want privacy and you want a wall, bro, but then you've got armed security, you've got the best there is, but you don't want us people to own guns, just like Hillary and Michael Moore.
[00:14:04.184 --> 00:14:04.865]  You're hypocrites.
[00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:05.445]  You're elitists.
[00:14:05.465 --> 00:14:06.125]  You're dirtbags.
[00:14:09.858 --> 00:14:15.880]  You know, I was thinking this morning about a place where I have dropped the ball.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:21.041]  And that is chronicling how much, in just five days, Trump has delivered.
[00:14:23.482 --> 00:14:29.604]  And even with his actions acting as President-elect, he did more than Obama ever did, because Obama was a globalist trying to suppress us.
[00:14:30.604 --> 00:14:32.645]  Trump is simply removing all the illegal garbage.
[00:14:32.725 --> 00:14:36.326]  Why can Trump just suddenly say, we're not turning off any more coal power plants?
[00:14:37.165 --> 00:14:39.286]  Why can he just suddenly say we're pulled out of TPP?
[00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:41.687]  Why can he just suddenly do all these things?
[00:14:42.067 --> 00:14:46.789]  Because under executive action, all this unconstitutional garbage was done.
[00:14:48.009 --> 00:14:49.170]  So he can just remove it.
[00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:50.430]  But here's the key.
[00:14:51.431 --> 00:15:03.556]  Upon removing all of this onerous tyranny, Trump is not then dictating it as a stick over the heads of the elites.
[00:15:04.997 --> 00:15:07.358]  He's returning it to the Congress and to the people.
[00:15:07.838 --> 00:15:08.638]  Look at TPP.
[00:15:09.279 --> 00:15:13.340]  He could have taken that whole agreement, kept it secret, done whatever he wanted, quote, for his interest.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.021]  No, he just said, it's gone.
[00:15:15.301 --> 00:15:16.901]  It was secret over 10 years.
[00:15:17.081 --> 00:15:19.402]  Hillary basically helped create it with Goldman Sachs.
[00:15:20.583 --> 00:15:21.803]  We're throwing the whole thing away.
[00:15:21.843 --> 00:15:22.983]  It was illegally brought in.
[00:15:23.003 --> 00:15:25.044]  It was being enforced by Obama outside of law.
[00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.325]  Congress didn't pass it.
[00:15:26.605 --> 00:15:27.045]  It's gone.
[00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:30.786]  We withdraw from the TPP because Obama had already put us into it.
[00:15:31.166 --> 00:15:32.527]  That was what day two he did that.
[00:15:36.772 --> 00:15:38.333]  And he passed the critical test.
[00:15:38.854 --> 00:15:43.378]  He devolved the power, which is what's needed, back to the states.
[00:15:45.139 --> 00:15:45.940]  And back to the people.
[00:15:46.861 --> 00:15:53.146]  And the howls of anger only intensified up into the sky.
[00:15:53.847 --> 00:15:55.048]  It's just unprecedented.
[00:15:55.548 --> 00:15:58.430]  And then notice that something they snuck by Reagan.
[00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.053]  I don't blame Reagan for this because he didn't really have a hand in it, but it happened.
[00:16:02.034 --> 00:16:06.116]  On Reagan's watch, so I guess he gets to blame some of the Democrats, but in what, 1983?
[00:16:06.336 --> 00:16:09.377]  The Vaccine Damage Fund?
[00:16:09.897 --> 00:16:13.899]  Which, I guess Reagan thought, oh, we're gonna pay for the kids that get hurt by bad vaccines.
[00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:28.466]  No, the law made it secret what happens to you, makes you go into a secret federal court, very hard to ever even get the vaccine damage money, and it's taxpayer money over a billion a year that's put in the fund to pay for what the vaccine makers do.
[00:16:29.106 --> 00:16:30.687]  Now, if somebody's above the law,
[00:16:31.687 --> 00:16:33.748]  And can't get in trouble, and there's a secret court.
[00:16:34.648 --> 00:16:37.209]  Do you think they're going to make better vaccines or worse vaccines?
[00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:48.374]  Because I'm not arguing that there isn't a science that you can take some type of pathogen that's been attenuated, that's been neutralized, and that your body then still learns that it's an outside enemy and creates antibodies for it.
[00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:53.263]  But that's your body going to war, and you do that too much, it causes problems.
[00:16:53.624 --> 00:16:54.504]  It causes shock.
[00:16:54.584 --> 00:16:57.186]  It causes blood on the brain.
[00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:00.608]  It causes the equivalent of your baby getting stung by a hundred bees.
[00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:09.933]  That's all that's happening when your baby goes into convulsions and is drooling a few hours after it gets all those vaccines, is it's having an allergic reaction.
[00:17:11.514 --> 00:17:16.016]  I've had hundreds of medical doctors on, hundreds over the years breaking this down, but you can read the insert.
[00:17:16.377 --> 00:17:29.223]  It says it can cause these shocks and cause seizures and then cause permanent epilepsy or narcolepsy or cause type 1 diabetes because it burns out your pancreas, pancreatitis.
[00:17:29.563 --> 00:17:31.484]  It says it on the inserts.
[00:17:31.564 --> 00:17:33.725]  We've shown them to you hundreds of times here.
[00:17:36.387 --> 00:17:40.669]  Every year when kids are getting ready to go to school, Dell Hospital here in Austin is full.
[00:17:42.188 --> 00:17:44.870]  Of children who suddenly can't process sugar.
[00:17:46.592 --> 00:17:48.474]  Who suddenly can't produce insulin.
[00:17:48.654 --> 00:17:50.075]  Who suddenly don't have a pancreas.
[00:17:52.557 --> 00:17:54.119]  And every time it's the vaccine.
[00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:57.482]  They go, oh, type 1, suddenly the genetic form is way up.
[00:18:01.101 --> 00:18:03.022]  Well yeah, because it's being destroyed.
[00:18:03.122 --> 00:18:14.169]  It says on the insert of the MMR shot and the flu shot and all the rest of them that it causes pancreatitis and then right under that it says diabetes.
[00:18:14.749 --> 00:18:15.570]  Diabetes.
[00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:16.830]  Diabetes.
[00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:18.031]  Diabetes.
[00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:19.192]  Diabetes.
[00:18:20.413 --> 00:18:22.254]  It hits your brain, it hits your pancreas.
[00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:23.134]  Big time.
[00:18:23.775 --> 00:18:27.357]  You have big autoimmune responses in them and a lot of times it burns them out.
[00:18:27.797 --> 00:18:29.018]  And your kid never comes back.
[00:18:31.601 --> 00:18:36.122]  Now, Barron is a very smart young man, and he's doing great.
[00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:39.723]  And a lot of people bounce back from damage from vaccines.
[00:18:39.743 --> 00:18:43.204]  But the word is, Barron got hurt when he was little with vaccines.
[00:18:43.465 --> 00:18:45.245]  See, this is a learning experience for Trump as well.
[00:18:45.265 --> 00:18:47.086]  And I'm not going to get into their private family business.
[00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:48.906]  They've said, leave their kids alone, and I've done that.
[00:18:49.646 --> 00:18:55.128]  But the point is, is that you notice Trump has got somebody who's had his family, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:18:55.248 --> 00:18:58.909]  up there, about to lead a commission and really bring out all the investigations.
[00:18:58.949 --> 00:19:00.230]  And I know what the investigations are.
[00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.210]  They're open and shut.
[00:19:03.985 --> 00:19:24.035]  We've got the 2003, even ABC News did its job back then, from a 2000 meeting at the head of the CDC facility with the head of it and all of them admitting it was causing autoimmune disorders and causing massive shock and massive allergic responses and massive brain damage and that they, A, had to cover it up or there'd be a civil war.
[00:19:24.275 --> 00:19:25.776]  They actually say a civil insurrection.
[00:19:26.316 --> 00:19:27.457]  Millions have been hurt or killed.
[00:19:28.057 --> 00:19:30.138]  And B, they had to clean the vaccines up.
[00:19:30.539 --> 00:19:31.199]  They didn't!
[00:19:31.399 --> 00:19:32.800]  The numbers are getting worse!
[00:19:34.517 --> 00:19:36.719]  They give the military experimental vaccines.
[00:19:36.959 --> 00:19:38.661]  You can't kill anthrax.
[00:19:40.122 --> 00:19:42.044]  Doesn't matter if you radiate it, burn it, whatever.
[00:19:43.145 --> 00:19:44.846]  Every spore's gotta be chopped in half.
[00:19:46.308 --> 00:19:48.330]  They inject the troops with live anthrax.
[00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:49.671]  No wonder so many died.
[00:19:49.971 --> 00:19:51.933]  This is how crazy it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:55.476 --> 00:20:00.581]  That's a whole other area how anthrax is literally living, dead, zombie plant spores.
[00:20:07.671 --> 00:20:17.218]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:20:18.239 --> 00:20:20.060]  And so I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:20:20.841 --> 00:20:26.585]  Why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsStore.com or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:20:27.285 --> 00:20:27.906]  And it's simple.
[00:20:28.526 --> 00:20:33.631]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:20:34.071 --> 00:20:35.072]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:20:35.092 --> 00:20:37.934]  There's quality versus price.
[00:20:37.974 --> 00:20:39.896]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:20:40.496 --> 00:20:53.468]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor, has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[00:20:54.833 --> 00:20:56.895]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:20:57.795 --> 00:21:04.780]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:21:05.581 --> 00:21:08.363]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:21:08.403 --> 00:21:10.805]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:21:10.845 --> 00:21:14.848]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:21:15.288 --> 00:21:16.089]  Well, believe me,
[00:21:17.182 --> 00:21:19.863]  This is disruptive to tyrants worldwide.
[00:21:20.443 --> 00:21:30.865]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:21:31.505 --> 00:21:33.125]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:21:33.705 --> 00:21:35.245]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:21:35.885 --> 00:21:42.967]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:21:43.707 --> 00:21:43.927]  We've
[00:21:45.007 --> 00:21:46.068]  Went out and did some testing.
[00:21:46.488 --> 00:21:48.830]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:55.316]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible could be so strong.
[00:21:55.556 --> 00:22:08.847]  So what we did is we went out, we used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:22:09.207 --> 00:22:10.028]  Born in Texas.
[00:22:10.368 --> 00:22:11.289]  Made in America.
[00:22:11.549 --> 00:22:14.172]  Exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[00:22:14.252 --> 00:22:15.052]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:22:15.092 --> 00:22:16.013]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:22:16.394 --> 00:22:17.715]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:22:17.775 --> 00:22:18.395]  It's waterproof.
[00:22:18.436 --> 00:22:18.876]  You can wear it.
[00:22:18.916 --> 00:22:19.496]  It's comfortable.
[00:22:19.577 --> 00:22:20.337]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:22:20.397 --> 00:22:22.699]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:30.767]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:22:31.468 --> 00:22:35.133]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:22:35.153 --> 00:22:41.983]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently test it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:22:42.003 --> 00:22:43.225]  What did they really say about this?
[00:22:43.245 --> 00:22:44.366]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:22:44.526 --> 00:22:47.270]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:22:48.111 --> 00:22:56.094]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:22:56.594 --> 00:23:01.595]  So they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:23:01.695 --> 00:23:09.118]  And 90, I mean you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in official crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:23:09.138 --> 00:23:10.378]  This stops that unless it's a slug.
[00:23:10.798 --> 00:23:11.938]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:23:11.998 --> 00:23:16.740]  So they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it and soon they won't have it.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:21.442]  If it's available to civilians who are not sure, we're gonna have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:23:21.642 --> 00:23:25.724]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:23:26.504 --> 00:23:29.845]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:23:29.885 --> 00:23:30.646]  People didn't believe in it.
[00:23:30.946 --> 00:23:31.966]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:23:32.026 --> 00:23:33.747]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:23:35.087 --> 00:23:37.188]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:23:40.487 --> 00:23:42.307]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:23:43.548 --> 00:23:45.448]  Again, fund the InfoWard.
[00:23:45.568 --> 00:23:49.489]  Get the game-changing nanotech tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:23:49.989 --> 00:23:52.010]  It's a win-win.
[00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:52.010]  $200.
[00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.530]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWardStore.com.
[00:23:55.631 --> 00:23:56.331]  It's amazing.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.682]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto Line.
[00:24:17.922 --> 00:24:22.024]  The desert is my brother, my skin is cracked and dry.
[00:24:22.604 --> 00:24:30.328]  I was riding on a cold coach, and everything was fine, till we took a shorter road to save some time.
[00:24:30.348 --> 00:24:35.990]  The bandits only fired once, they shot me in the chest.
[00:24:37.311 --> 00:24:41.833]  They may have wounded me, but they'll never get the best of better men.
[00:24:59.573 --> 00:25:07.297]  By the way, if you just tuned in at the end of that little breakdown about Trump coming out and saying we're going to investigate the vaccines, we're going to put the facts on the table.
[00:25:08.598 --> 00:25:12.060]  They're talking about anthrax and thinking about experimental vaccines they use in the military.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.742]  I was talking to a lot of veterans up in D.C.
[00:25:15.942 --> 00:25:16.343]  over the
[00:25:17.807 --> 00:25:18.047]  I don't know.
[00:25:39.008 --> 00:25:45.179]  And that Bioport that produced the anthrax vaccine got caught having live anthrax in it.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.203]  And so I was going from memory...
[00:25:48.396 --> 00:26:03.901]  And I said, listen, anthrax is a type of bacteria that when it goes into its dormant phase, it's similar to the plant family, and this is layman terms, that it folds in on itself, shrivels up into a crystalline state, and they've documented hundreds of thousands of years it can live in the dirt.
[00:26:04.921 --> 00:26:07.842]  I've said hundreds of the military guys, because that's well known.
[00:26:08.402 --> 00:26:09.882]  And they believe maybe millions.
[00:26:10.003 --> 00:26:18.005]  And so one of the big theories is this is the type of family of bacteria that might have seeded the earth if you don't believe in the Christian cosmology.
[00:26:19.718 --> 00:26:41.645]  But I went and researched it again when I got home Saturday for like an hour and of course it's just so amazing the processes of just this family of bacteria that anthrax happens to be a part of and that they know you can't radiate it, you can't hardly burn it, there's no way to attenuate it where it doesn't make you sick.
[00:26:42.947 --> 00:26:46.429]  And that's why they keep coming back with anthrax vaccines and it keeps killing people.
[00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:53.154]  Because you're trying to give someone something that can't be killed because it kills itself.
[00:26:53.954 --> 00:27:07.023]  When this family of bacteria that anthrax comes from, and again, I'm not a scientist, I'm just giving the basic breakdowns, go research it for yourself, starts freezing or starts dying, it goes through this process where it folds in on itself and the bacteria eats itself.
[00:27:07.103 --> 00:27:12.487]  It divides the other side, eats the other side, then it implodes and shrinks in to a solid
[00:27:13.128 --> 00:27:17.181]  Crystalline form that can last millions of years.
[00:27:18.446 --> 00:27:18.968]  It's dead.
[00:27:19.168 --> 00:27:19.670]  It's dormant.
[00:27:20.563 --> 00:27:22.544]  You talk about suspended animation.
[00:27:23.044 --> 00:27:28.206]  So, our scientists go, here, put it in a big tank, fry it with radiation, heat it up.
[00:27:28.346 --> 00:27:30.467]  Okay, we think these spores are dead.
[00:27:30.927 --> 00:27:35.309]  And this will make it where when you get hit by these spores, your body would have learned how to deal with them.
[00:27:35.509 --> 00:27:37.010]  There is no dealing with it.
[00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:44.893]  And the truth is, it was all a big giant experiment to see what mutations would be caused by injecting humans with this deadly bacteria.
[00:27:46.223 --> 00:27:49.326]  Because it's known to manipulate human DNA in survivors.
[00:27:49.986 --> 00:28:08.642]  And so all the military that was given this, and I've been told this by high-ups, again I'm not a scientist, I'm giving you the gestalt of what I was told, you were guinea pigs because the globalists then later at the VA get your blood and they're testing and watching and looking for certain mutations they want to use in their long-term gene therapy programs and what they called
[00:28:10.046 --> 00:28:16.272]  Basically, the eternal cell line that was first found in a woman here in the United States back in the 40s.
[00:28:16.973 --> 00:28:20.436]  Cancer killed her in a week, and they found that the cancer never dies.
[00:28:20.836 --> 00:28:27.783]  You can put a piece of the tumor in a dish, freeze it, or leave it out in the open, and it just sits there and doesn't die.
[00:28:29.755 --> 00:28:30.315]  It's a zombie.
[00:28:31.436 --> 00:28:32.396]  It doesn't need oxygen.
[00:28:32.436 --> 00:28:34.537]  It doesn't need nutrients.
[00:28:34.557 --> 00:28:35.438]  It doesn't need anything.
[00:28:35.798 --> 00:28:39.220]  So they're obsessed with what I call zombie cell lines.
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.921]  This isn't zombie movies, folks.
[00:28:40.941 --> 00:28:41.841]  This is the real deal.
[00:28:42.702 --> 00:28:50.305]  And anthrax, in the bacteria slash plant family, it's in the whole side of the bacteria family that's associated with plants.
[00:28:50.966 --> 00:28:52.887]  And again, I'm giving you just a layman's breakdown of this.
[00:28:53.207 --> 00:28:54.528]  I've read hundreds of papers on it.
[00:28:55.508 --> 00:28:56.869]  And then over on the other side,
[00:28:57.932 --> 00:29:02.356]  Cancers in humans, where the cells are so strong and so powerful, they won't die.
[00:29:03.137 --> 00:29:06.060]  Unless you completely burn them into ashes.
[00:29:08.001 --> 00:29:10.984]  The problem is with anthrax, is heating it up doesn't do it either.
[00:29:11.725 --> 00:29:15.148]  Until you smash the crystals at a microscopic level.
[00:29:15.709 --> 00:29:16.930]  Heating it up doesn't kill it.
[00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:19.510]  You have to turn it into ashes.
[00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:21.491]  You have to burn it into dust.
[00:29:21.831 --> 00:29:22.791]  I didn't mean to segue.
[00:29:23.291 --> 00:29:29.273]  It's just the media will make a joke and go, Jones claims the government injected troops with zombie spores.
[00:29:30.053 --> 00:29:30.613]  Well, yes.
[00:29:31.053 --> 00:29:32.573]  That's what anthrax is.
[00:29:32.673 --> 00:29:41.336]  It is a desiccated zombie bacteria that can live a million years and that reactivates.
[00:29:41.736 --> 00:29:42.976]  And we injected the troops with that.
[00:29:44.056 --> 00:29:44.376]  Okay.
[00:29:44.937 --> 00:29:45.938]  You can't make this up.
[00:29:46.259 --> 00:29:47.260]  Pretty strange than fiction.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.362]  Moron Trump's overthrow of the New World Order.
[00:29:49.602 --> 00:29:50.183]  Straight ahead.
[00:29:50.203 --> 00:29:51.584]  Trump is on fire.
[00:29:52.726 --> 00:29:53.627]  We're on the march.
[00:29:54.107 --> 00:29:55.709]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.333]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.208 --> 00:30:12.750]  The Associated Press is reporting this week that former President Barack Obama was releasing money right and left hours before Donald Trump took the oath of office on Friday.
[00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:15.870]  On Friday morning, he released $221 million in U.S.
[00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:20.911]  funding for the Palestinian Authority on the morning just hours before he was set to leave office.
[00:30:20.991 --> 00:30:31.633]  Now, one State Department official and several congressional aides say that the Obama administration formally notified Congress it's going to be spending that money on Friday morning, just hours before Donald Trump became president.
[00:30:32.133 --> 00:30:42.040]  Also, more than $227 million in foreign affairs funding was released at the same time, including $4 million for climate change programs and $1.2 million for UN organizations.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:47.483]  Now, GOP lawmakers have placed holds on the Palestinian funds, but not on everything else.
[00:30:47.543 --> 00:31:00.192]  Congressional holds are generally respected by the executive branch, but they're not legally binding, so it looks like Obama's funding spree, all of it, is going to be going through, and he did this literally hours before Donald Trump had taken the office.
[00:31:03.034 --> 00:31:07.440]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:18.475]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:31:18.615 --> 00:31:23.538]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:31:23.658 --> 00:31:26.179]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:31:26.239 --> 00:31:27.740]  It helps detoxify.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.781]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:31:30.841 --> 00:31:35.584]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:31:35.604 --> 00:31:39.746]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:47.172]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:31:47.292 --> 00:31:48.714]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:31:48.914 --> 00:31:49.635]  This is so key.
[00:31:49.895 --> 00:31:54.199]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:31:54.219 --> 00:31:56.321]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:31:56.441 --> 00:31:59.904]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.081]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:32:05.301 --> 00:32:10.104]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[00:32:10.224 --> 00:32:13.487]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[00:32:13.747 --> 00:32:19.130]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:28.156]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[00:32:28.396 --> 00:32:33.500]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:40.443]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[00:32:40.743 --> 00:32:45.325]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[00:32:45.465 --> 00:32:48.626]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:50.667]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[00:32:50.847 --> 00:32:56.169]  Even better, use coupon code POWER at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[00:32:56.469 --> 00:32:58.450]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:00.451]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[00:33:10.657 --> 00:33:21.581]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:33:25.763 --> 00:33:28.404]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:33.263 --> 00:33:38.544]  So, Trump is going after the corrupt vaccine makers that have been caught poisoning the general public.
[00:33:38.584 --> 00:33:42.326]  He's also looking into not giving experimental vaccines to folks in the military.
[00:33:42.366 --> 00:33:44.906]  That's part of the whole commission that Robert F.K.
[00:33:44.946 --> 00:33:45.326]  Jr.
[00:33:45.446 --> 00:33:46.207]  is going to head up.
[00:33:47.127 --> 00:33:52.428]  Trump is, again, helped buoy through Trump euphoria the stock market.
[00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:00.193]  20,000.
[00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:00.193]  In fact, if you can pull it up on screen, let's look where it is right now.
[00:34:01.093 --> 00:34:03.715]  And so many other just incredibly positive things.
[00:34:03.815 --> 00:34:07.417]  Huge factories coming back, being announced every other day.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:15.223]  And the media is selling it like Trump is abandoning America, Trump is trying to hurt America.
[00:34:15.783 --> 00:34:17.324]  Trump is doing the opposite.
[00:34:17.464 --> 00:34:18.245]  The Dow is now at 20,060.85.
[00:34:23.735 --> 00:34:25.436]  Trump is doing the opposite.
[00:34:25.677 --> 00:34:29.700]  He's saying we're going to rebuild our infrastructure, we're going to stand up for our interests.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:41.569]  That doesn't mean the United States won't be involved in the world, but we're not going to pay for multinational corporations to go take over third world countries, exploit their labor, and then ship in their crap.
[00:34:43.134 --> 00:34:44.355]  To destroy American jobs.
[00:34:44.375 --> 00:34:56.042]  We're not going to let foreign multinationals controlling federal regulators steal our jobs by openly setting up regulations that make it impossible to do business in this country unless you're an insider.
[00:34:57.603 --> 00:35:00.525]  They've chosen what areas of the country they want to develop.
[00:35:01.405 --> 00:35:02.106]  The globalist half.
[00:35:03.234 --> 00:35:06.577]  And they've decided that the Midwest and other areas are to be depopulated.
[00:35:06.837 --> 00:35:07.738]  That's official!
[00:35:08.419 --> 00:35:24.132]  That's what Obama signed into law with his whole Rural Affairs Commission that the Pentagon would head up under Agenda 21 to force integrate city people into the country and basically set up Black Lives Matter type scenarios all over the nation.
[00:35:24.152 --> 00:35:29.998]  I mean this is so incredibly diabolical what's going on and it was so evil
[00:35:31.004 --> 00:35:37.629]  That because you exposed it and other people exposed it, it's now burning up and collapsing in flames so fast.
[00:35:40.752 --> 00:35:43.174]  Now Trump has pointed out that the Vatican has walls.
[00:35:43.214 --> 00:35:46.256]  He's pointed out that China has a great wall and a wall on its coastline.
[00:35:46.536 --> 00:35:50.839]  He's pointed out that we've paid for walls in Iraq, walls in Afghanistan, walls in Macedonia.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:58.846]  The United States has paid for hundreds of walls, well thousands of smaller walls, but hundreds of walls in different nations along borders.
[00:36:00.049 --> 00:36:04.670]  And now under Obama, they've been paying to take down those walls and bring all the jihadis into Europe.
[00:36:06.291 --> 00:36:13.093]  And so Trump's pointed out to Mexico, you have a contiguous, you have a continual wall on your southern border.
[00:36:13.233 --> 00:36:14.074]  It never ends.
[00:36:14.494 --> 00:36:15.414]  It never stops.
[00:36:16.614 --> 00:36:20.115]  You have areas that are accessible by humans on the Guatemala border.
[00:36:20.496 --> 00:36:21.516]  You have helicopters.
[00:36:21.556 --> 00:36:22.536]  You have armored vehicles.
[00:36:22.796 --> 00:36:23.637]  You have military.
[00:36:23.797 --> 00:36:24.257]  I've been there.
[00:36:24.297 --> 00:36:24.717]  I've seen it.
[00:36:27.998 --> 00:36:30.460]  Well, we're going to do the same thing on our border.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:44.169]  It's completely out of control and lawless, and there are over 250,000 aggravated felons in the United States from all over Europe, all over Asia, all over Russia, Latin America, Canada, you name it.
[00:36:44.409 --> 00:36:47.292]  We don't care what color you are or where you came from.
[00:36:47.632 --> 00:36:51.955]  If you are a felon or aggravated felon and you're in this country and you get picked up,
[00:36:52.435 --> 00:37:00.621]  You are being put on an airplane and your butt is being flown back to the country that is waiting for you many times criminal charges.
[00:37:01.462 --> 00:37:04.765]  The United States is not a dumping ground for miscreants.
[00:37:05.485 --> 00:37:08.387]  Also, we're not going to have the anchor baby status anymore.
[00:37:08.588 --> 00:37:11.050]  He's getting ready in the next two days to announce that it's been announced.
[00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:16.614]  Where you don't just come here and have a kid free and everything's paid for and they become a citizen.
[00:37:18.234 --> 00:37:21.796]  It's the Chinese that have now outpaced Mexico in doing that.
[00:37:22.077 --> 00:37:23.317]  We are a joke!
[00:37:24.078 --> 00:37:26.840]  And again, they try to bully us into submission as we go bankrupt.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:27.960]  You will pay for it!
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.561]  You will do it!
[00:37:28.821 --> 00:37:29.721]  It's the right thing to do!
[00:37:30.942 --> 00:37:33.364]  I didn't get to it yesterday, but there was a clip on Tucker Carlson.
[00:37:33.384 --> 00:37:41.229]  There's another one out today where the communist on the program is saying, oh well, America's racist.
[00:37:42.481 --> 00:37:44.423]  So that's why you have to let more people in.
[00:37:44.463 --> 00:37:46.205]  You have to prove that you're not racist.
[00:37:46.265 --> 00:37:56.596]  And Carlson says to him, because they all have the same talking point, these liberal groups, well, if we're totally white supremacists, why then have we become a non-white population in most areas?
[00:37:56.616 --> 00:37:58.898]  And it's going to be totally reversed within 20 years.
[00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:07.476]  See, Trump and everybody else is just trying to get an American birthright to anybody that comes here who actually wants to be an American.
[00:38:08.097 --> 00:38:14.623]  Instead, the globalists want to turn you into a mental patient running around screaming and yelling, you're an effing white male.
[00:38:15.924 --> 00:38:19.507]  And calling for socialism and calling for the American dream to be welfare.
[00:38:19.528 --> 00:38:24.152]  So you can be completely conditioned and controlled.
[00:38:28.251 --> 00:38:36.175]  Trump's also calling for a major investigation into voter fraud, which was organized by the Democrats so it became election fraud.
[00:38:36.435 --> 00:38:52.963]  And I have an entire stack of news I want to cover right now documenting the fact that Pew Research and ICE and so many other organizations have found that what Trump is saying is actually
[00:38:55.851 --> 00:38:57.651]  Not even 10% of how bad it is.
[00:38:58.172 --> 00:39:01.693]  It's worse than what President Trump is saying.
[00:39:03.153 --> 00:39:17.497]  And just like they told us we could never have President Trump, they never told us we could get out of the TPP, they never told us we could get out of Obamacare, they never told us, they never told us, they told us over and over and over again that it was impossible
[00:39:18.336 --> 00:39:26.298]  To ever reverse any of this, and five days in, it's on fire, and more than 10% of the globalist agenda is already gone.
[00:39:29.099 --> 00:39:39.661]  It's happening much quicker than I thought, but it's a blitzkrieg approach of just overwhelming the enemy, Trump hitting him with all of his energy, and delegating.
[00:39:40.161 --> 00:39:46.903]  You notice, Saturday, as soon as Mattis had been
[00:39:48.376 --> 00:39:52.499]  Confirmed to the Secretary of Defense that a whole bunch of targets across Syria got bombed.
[00:39:52.659 --> 00:39:55.821]  Big command and control bases that Obama had been protecting.
[00:39:56.521 --> 00:39:59.903]  As Trump told the CIA, the gloves are off.
[00:40:03.025 --> 00:40:03.946]  Target all Al Qaeda.
[00:40:06.868 --> 00:40:07.628]  Target all ISIS.
[00:40:07.648 --> 00:40:11.951]  Because what Obama would do is sit there over every little target and of course protect them.
[00:40:12.291 --> 00:40:17.775]  Because he was only basically intimidated by being exposed to targeting any of the targets.
[00:40:22.338 --> 00:40:25.359]  So a lot of the top leaders are being killed as we speak.
[00:40:25.419 --> 00:40:26.700]  Those stories are up on screen.
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:34.363]  But remember that we challenged Trump months before the election, the final election.
[00:40:35.223 --> 00:40:37.084]  Last year we said they will engage in fraud.
[00:40:37.104 --> 00:40:39.245]  Homeland Security is trying to take over the election.
[00:40:39.645 --> 00:40:41.005]  They will bust in the illegals.
[00:40:41.385 --> 00:40:42.946]  Project Veritas caught them on tape.
[00:40:43.486 --> 00:40:47.608]  Democrats bragged about it in newspapers saying if you're an illegal alien or you're a
[00:40:48.444 --> 00:41:01.288]  You know, criminal or you're whatever, just go out, read the obituary, find out if somebody's dead, and the Democrats will give you a match in a local voter roll and give you a list of people to go out and vote in their stead.
[00:41:01.308 --> 00:41:06.489]  And they arrested people in Texas, in Colorado, in New Mexico, all over the country.
[00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:12.751]  In Florida, with lists of people who were dead who were on the voter rolls.
[00:41:13.051 --> 00:41:17.873]  Who do you think matched up those dead people, recently dead, with voters on the voter rolls?
[00:41:18.848 --> 00:41:19.728]  The Democratic Party.
[00:41:20.488 --> 00:41:33.471]  I've got a stack of news here, but even Fox News goes, well Trump's right that there are millions of people, millions of dead people on the voter rolls, and millions of illegals that reportedly vote sometime, but there's no proof it's organized.
[00:41:34.011 --> 00:41:35.771]  And there's no proof it's massive.
[00:41:37.951 --> 00:41:47.453]  But now all of a sudden, they're having to back off and saying, well, millions of illegals probably did vote in 2016, and of all places, that's Politico.
[00:41:49.503 --> 00:41:50.364]  Scroll back to the top of that.
[00:41:50.384 --> 00:41:52.745]  That's Investors Business Daily.
[00:41:52.765 --> 00:41:55.306]  I also saw a similar headline from Politico.
[00:41:56.747 --> 00:41:57.948]  So Trump knows what he's doing.
[00:41:58.348 --> 00:42:05.172]  He is exposing the whole Democratic Party program that's public in seven different states.
[00:42:05.512 --> 00:42:13.517]  Well, 14 states are trying, but seven actually got bills out of their legislatures in the last two years to have illegals vote.
[00:42:13.837 --> 00:42:18.460]  But none of the governors could sign it because it was so bold it would violate federal law.
[00:42:19.875 --> 00:42:26.437]  But Illinois and California and other states, they passed laws that illegals could vote.
[00:42:26.457 --> 00:42:32.779]  They didn't say illegals, they said that anyone that's here, including migrants or immigrants, can vote.
[00:42:33.619 --> 00:42:35.900]  Nowhere else on earth can you just show up and vote.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:40.201]  China, that's always criticizing us and calling us fascists, doesn't have voting.
[00:42:41.321 --> 00:42:46.563]  They have a Politburo and a Central Committee, but they have a president, so it's okay.
[00:42:48.649 --> 00:42:56.133]  So Trump calls for major investigation into voter fraud, and I was watching Fox News this morning, and they were saying, well, he's really wrong.
[00:42:56.213 --> 00:43:11.460]  I mean, millions of illegals didn't vote, even though I have Pew Research reports and Fox News pieces, but it was Fox Business, admitting the numbers were way bigger than the 2, 3, or 4, or 5 million that Trump says they think may have voted.
[00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:23.337]  So of course, if the Democrats are organizing them to vote, caught on tape having them vote, people are being arrested, they're saying illegals have a right to vote, then of course this should be investigated.
[00:43:23.558 --> 00:43:24.859]  But they act like nothing's happening.
[00:43:25.219 --> 00:43:29.002]  All over the country they're calling it civil rights to not show your ID when you vote.
[00:43:29.662 --> 00:43:32.805]  But they want you to show your ID when you do everything else.
[00:43:34.192 --> 00:43:35.553]  Paul Watson wrote a key report on it.
[00:43:35.833 --> 00:43:41.216]  Three million votes in presidential election cast by illegal aliens, and he goes over the fact.
[00:43:41.536 --> 00:43:50.462]  We should retweet that article at Trump, because so many times when he comes out with his statements, he doesn't really go over the evidence.
[00:43:50.822 --> 00:43:52.243]  I understand it's hard to do that in a tweet.
[00:43:53.123 --> 00:43:56.966]  Spicer, by the way, who's getting more hardcore, has been doing that.
[00:43:57.266 --> 00:44:02.009]  And speaking of Spicer, let's go to the Communist News Network covering one of his press conferences.
[00:44:03.294 --> 00:44:12.861]  He stated his concerns of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign, and he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him.
[00:44:12.981 --> 00:44:22.988]  Press Secretary Sean Spicer doubling down on the president's claim, but repeatedly unable to point to evidence that backs up the charge that has been debunked by Republicans and Democrats alike.
[00:44:23.308 --> 00:44:25.789]  You said the president believes that there was voter fraud.
[00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.090]  I wonder if you believe that.
[00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:32.072]  You were at the Republican National Committee at the time, and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was the chairman of the RNC at the time.
[00:44:32.372 --> 00:44:34.153]  Do you believe there was widespread voter fraud?
[00:44:34.173 --> 00:44:40.315]  My job is not... Look, I... How can he be comfortable with his win if he believes there was 3 million votes?
[00:44:40.355 --> 00:44:41.116]  Maybe he didn't win.
[00:44:41.156 --> 00:44:42.476]  No, he's very comfortable with his win.
[00:44:42.616 --> 00:44:43.877]  It's an electoral-based system.
[00:44:44.317 --> 00:44:49.139]  You've got 306 electoral votes, 33... Let's back this up for a second, but I just want to make a point here.
[00:44:52.708 --> 00:45:00.432]  The same Republican Party that ganged up on Trump and said that he was crazy and evil and bad are the ones that said that there was no evidence of any voter fraud.
[00:45:03.614 --> 00:45:10.518]  So they know when they're saying all this that it's garbage, and they're also saying, oh, Trump isn't comfortable with his win.
[00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:13.651]  And so that's why he's doing this.
[00:45:13.731 --> 00:45:24.517]  No, he's trying to secure voting rights in this country for citizens and not letting the globalists who are using massive immigrant invasions as a tool to overthrow countries.
[00:45:26.598 --> 00:45:30.541]  He's trying to defend the integrity and sovereignty and Trump knows.
[00:45:31.909 --> 00:45:44.061]  That top election fraud experts have reported that at least five states were stolen from him and that Hillary tried and failed in six other states where Homeland Security was caught hundreds of times per state.
[00:45:47.965 --> 00:45:50.247]  Trying to break into the computers on election day.
[00:45:51.668 --> 00:45:52.429]  There's another headline.
[00:45:52.469 --> 00:45:54.071]  Illegal immigrants could elect Hillary.
[00:45:54.091 --> 00:45:55.152]  Please print me that as well.
[00:45:56.735 --> 00:45:57.535]  That's Politico!
[00:45:58.196 --> 00:46:22.067]  Again, there's this leftist, globalist, elitist operating system, where they admit their plan for illegals to overthrow Trump, and they admit they're getting him to vote, and we have them on all these videos, and election officials in New York admitting the massive fraud plan, and we have the WikiLeaks memos, and we have them admitting that they're planning to do it, then we catch them doing it, President
[00:46:25.356 --> 00:46:39.174]  Trump, when he was a candidate, comes out and exposes it, and it's been proven right, and then he's the bad guy, and a bunch of surly, elitist, arrogant, press corps people, who aren't even real press, come out and say, oh, he doesn't feel legitimate.
[00:46:40.523 --> 00:46:42.864]  He won the Electoral College.
[00:46:43.184 --> 00:46:50.646]  He would have won in a bigger landslide and would have won the popular vote, clearly losing about 2 million votes to Hillary if this hadn't been the case of your fraud.
[00:46:50.666 --> 00:47:02.670]  And by the way, all 50, that's 50, ladies and gentlemen, 50, all 50 state attorney generals have written letters, that includes Democrats.
[00:47:05.029 --> 00:47:10.412]  To Trump saying, please reverse the executive actions of Obama saying that elections are now federal.
[00:47:10.472 --> 00:47:11.273]  That's scary.
[00:47:11.513 --> 00:47:12.833]  That's not supposed to work that way.
[00:47:13.054 --> 00:47:18.257]  Remember Obama said whenever I brought it up, oh that crazy guy in Texas, we don't run the elections, don't worry.
[00:47:18.317 --> 00:47:21.678]  They were sure trying, but doing it by stealth didn't work.
[00:47:22.959 --> 00:47:26.741]  So Trump's been proven correct, so they're crapping their drawers right now.
[00:47:27.842 --> 00:47:28.282]  Literally.
[00:47:30.604 --> 00:47:33.825]  And trying to make it look illegitimate that Trump knows what really went on.
[00:47:33.865 --> 00:47:34.666]  Let's go back to the tape.
[00:47:35.805 --> 00:47:38.847]  Trump has got a good idea to kick most of these people out because these aren't real reporters.
[00:47:39.047 --> 00:47:39.827]  Look at that little surly guy.
[00:47:39.867 --> 00:47:41.048]  He thinks he's arrived because he's arrogant.
[00:47:41.068 --> 00:47:41.688]  He'll do what he's told.
[00:47:41.708 --> 00:47:42.049]  He'll spin.
[00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:43.950]  Did you hear him say maybe he didn't win?
[00:48:06.414 --> 00:48:11.200]  Spicer's talking over him, but he says, maybe, why's he not secure in his victory?
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.221]  Maybe he didn't win.
[00:48:14.243 --> 00:48:18.308]  Oh, just like they had recounts and he got more votes back than Hillary did?
[00:48:18.328 --> 00:48:20.110]  10 to 1 or more?
[00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:27.118]  Oh, just like she lost electors, she lost 5, he lost 2 in that initiative?
[00:48:28.134 --> 00:48:28.634]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:48:29.194 --> 00:48:30.795]  CNN reporter on Trump.
[00:48:31.115 --> 00:48:32.196]  Maybe he didn't win.
[00:48:32.476 --> 00:48:36.417]  But don't worry, let's have CNN front row seats right there.
[00:48:39.198 --> 00:48:43.220]  Let's not have a drudge correspondent, a Breitbart and Infowars, at least even mixed in.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.640]  And look, I'm not criticizing it.
[00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:46.341]  Quite frankly, I don't even want to be in there.
[00:48:46.921 --> 00:48:53.184]  We probably do need to set up a bureau just to cover what's happening there and all our sources and go to some of these just for optics.
[00:48:53.244 --> 00:48:55.644]  But we're taking back the country.
[00:48:55.664 --> 00:48:56.685]  That's why we're here in Austin.
[00:48:57.711 --> 00:49:01.194]  We're taking back the country, reaching out to the people and doing the hard work.
[00:49:01.454 --> 00:49:05.837]  Not sitting in there being arrogant so people are on the water cooler at failing CNN.
[00:49:05.857 --> 00:49:06.838]  I'm skipping this break.
[00:49:07.319 --> 00:49:08.780]  People at failing CNN.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:09.360]  Joke CNN.
[00:49:11.343 --> 00:49:15.426]  Totally discredited CNN and go, oh, good job saying maybe he wasn't even elected.
[00:49:15.726 --> 00:49:27.555]  Oh, see, Trump comes in, he's elected, but says, I'm going to secure our voting because the Democrats have got all these illegals voting, we've caught them doing it, and this guy's so arrogant, he says maybe Trump didn't even win.
[00:49:31.178 --> 00:49:31.959]  And then that's news.
[00:49:32.599 --> 00:49:39.004]  Because this guy's wearing a $3,000 suit and, you know, wearing little black rimmed glasses and acting like an intellectual.
[00:49:39.024 --> 00:49:39.785]  He's so smart.
[00:49:41.203 --> 00:49:56.310]  Because they all say together, there's no evidence of fraud, no evidence of illegals, just seven states passing out of their houses laws for illegals to vote, and illegals being caught everywhere, and Democrats caught commanding the illegals, but it's not really illegals that are the big issue.
[00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:57.031]  They're part of it.
[00:49:57.431 --> 00:50:00.612]  It's mainly Democrats with lists of dead voters running around.
[00:50:01.593 --> 00:50:03.934]  My estimates are that's three to one, that.
[00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:05.575]  And of course,
[00:50:06.616 --> 00:50:10.677]  When Trump says he wants an investigation, he means executive branch to codify.
[00:50:10.717 --> 00:50:11.897]  Don't worry, Mr. President.
[00:50:12.317 --> 00:50:14.518]  I've asked Paul Watson, and I'll do it as well.
[00:50:14.538 --> 00:50:24.760]  In the next 48 hours, I'm going to shoot a detailed bullet report showing each admission, each arrest, your documents, where they're doing it, the laws, how they admit it, how the UN's calling for it.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:29.301]  The UN called last year for America to accept, quote, migrants voting.
[00:50:29.861 --> 00:50:32.001]  Germany's moving to let, quote, migrants vote.
[00:50:32.302 --> 00:50:36.923]  Some German cities let people who've got off the plane one day vote.
[00:50:37.563 --> 00:50:39.103]  Oh, but there's none of this happening.
[00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:41.263]  None of this is going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:43.844 --> 00:50:45.084]  There are no dead people voting.
[00:50:45.964 --> 00:50:49.445]  Even though they're bragging, ha, illegals and dead people are what's going to beat Trump.
[00:50:50.025 --> 00:50:51.666]  Hillary's got a secret weapon.
[00:50:51.886 --> 00:50:53.466]  The illegals, you don't like Trump.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:07.733]  Sorry, the legal people that are here, the people that happen to be Hispanic or Russian or African that have become citizens, they get what's happening and they want a piece of the American pie and they know Trump is addressing it and they voted for him in record numbers.
[00:51:07.933 --> 00:51:10.176]  That's why your giant election fraud failed.
[00:51:10.476 --> 00:51:14.120]  You stole five states and still you fail.
[00:51:15.677 --> 00:51:18.921]  You hit Roger Stone with polonium, still you failed.
[00:51:19.422 --> 00:51:21.905]  You threw everything you had at us, but still you failed.
[00:51:22.166 --> 00:51:26.071]  How'd you like us sending out all the people to scream rape at your events?
[00:51:26.111 --> 00:51:27.092]  Think that helps you a little bit?
[00:51:27.773 --> 00:51:28.554]  That was nothing.
[00:51:28.774 --> 00:51:29.736]  We had tactics.
[00:51:30.657 --> 00:51:36.482]  Ten times more hardcore that were legal, ready to be used, but we knew the internal polls were showing we were going to beat you.
[00:51:36.963 --> 00:51:45.491]  So if you really want the gloves off, if you think your army of a bunch of screaming ugly harpies wearing pink condoms on their heads scares us, you got nothing coming.
[00:51:45.711 --> 00:51:47.833]  It scares us you've turned them into such slobs!
[00:51:48.354 --> 00:51:49.435]  Such entitled fools!
[00:51:52.654 --> 00:51:54.315]  But it doesn't scare us of the outcome.
[00:51:54.355 --> 00:51:55.475]  We're going to win.
[00:51:55.495 --> 00:51:57.056]  And get ready.
[00:51:57.336 --> 00:52:06.981]  We finally have somebody in the executive branch that isn't out to get America, and doesn't care what you think or say, and knows that you're a pack of colluding sycophantic
[00:52:08.297 --> 00:52:08.977]  Vampires!
[00:52:09.217 --> 00:52:17.119]  Now let's go back to this little vampire turd, pile of garbage, whatever his name is, who says, maybe he didn't win, maybe he didn't win.
[00:52:17.359 --> 00:52:26.001]  So see, oh, Trump's crazy to say he won by more, but this guy with no proof, the same CNN that said that the crowd was 10%, total lie!
[00:52:26.441 --> 00:52:29.422]  Or that they got rid of the bust of Martin Luther King, total lie!
[00:52:29.922 --> 00:52:32.723]  These people are just outrageous enemies of this country.
[00:52:32.883 --> 00:52:33.483]  Let's go back to it.
[00:52:33.843 --> 00:52:36.146]  For democracy though, Sean, what does that mean?
[00:52:36.306 --> 00:52:38.249]  If he does believe that, what does that mean for democracy?
[00:52:38.269 --> 00:52:40.151]  It means that I've answered your question.
[00:52:40.331 --> 00:52:50.585]  The allegations of voter fraud, which Trump has repeatedly made before taking office, surfaced again after the president repeated that claim Monday night while meeting with congressional leaders at the White House.
[00:52:51.005 --> 00:52:53.087]  I think he won very handily.
[00:52:53.247 --> 00:52:54.528]  He's very comfortable with his win.
[00:52:54.668 --> 00:52:56.049]  But he doesn't sound like it.
[00:52:56.309 --> 00:53:00.112]  He won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million.
[00:53:00.452 --> 00:53:03.134]  He charged that 3 to 5 million people voted illegally.
[00:53:03.334 --> 00:53:06.737]  A claim as unsubstantiated as when he first made it after the election.
[00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:09.379]  But now it carries the weight of the presidency.
[00:53:09.819 --> 00:53:14.704]  To back up the allegations, his advisors have pointed to a 2012 study by the Pew Center.
[00:53:14.984 --> 00:53:19.008]  It found nearly 3 million people have voter registrations in more than one state.
[00:53:19.168 --> 00:53:21.590]  And nearly 2 million people are listed as dead.
[00:53:21.951 --> 00:53:24.193]  But the study made no finding of voter fraud.
[00:53:24.213 --> 00:53:25.294]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:53:25.314 --> 00:53:26.355]  CNN's done it again.
[00:53:26.475 --> 00:53:27.215]  The same ones that...
[00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:32.574]  Showed the crowd coming in at 830, and then cut it, and showed the crowd going out later.
[00:53:32.614 --> 00:53:38.478]  You see the crowd change to lie to the public, just like PBS did, just like Young Turks did, all deceiving you.
[00:53:39.319 --> 00:53:42.742]  We have the Pew Research Report, and Fox had it on Fox Business.
[00:53:43.542 --> 00:53:44.302]  A few months ago.
[00:53:44.442 --> 00:53:45.843]  And the numbers are way bigger.
[00:53:46.243 --> 00:53:48.744]  Those were only numbers in one part of the study.
[00:53:49.164 --> 00:53:51.045]  The numbers are in the tens of millions.
[00:53:51.425 --> 00:53:57.988]  But what the experts believe are voting is 2 to 3 million illegals and 3 to 5 million quote dead people.
[00:53:58.976 --> 00:54:00.897]  Now, you add that together.
[00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:03.839]  Conservatively, there's 5, 6, 7, 8 million people that are voting.
[00:54:04.219 --> 00:54:05.160]  And we know who does this.
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:06.101]  This is Democrats.
[00:54:06.341 --> 00:54:09.263]  So Trump could probably say he really won by 6, 7 million.
[00:54:09.663 --> 00:54:14.006]  He's being conservative so he knows when the research is done, it'll be more than what he said.
[00:54:16.337 --> 00:54:18.658]  Undocumented America, the truth of illegal immigration.
[00:54:18.878 --> 00:54:21.239]  Let's go ahead and play the report on the Pew Research.
[00:54:22.239 --> 00:54:27.481]  According to Pew, 24 million people, one of every eight, voter registrations in the U.S.
[00:54:27.541 --> 00:54:31.002]  are no longer valid or significantly inaccurate.
[00:54:31.502 --> 00:54:35.724]  More than 1.8 million dead people are listed as voters.
[00:54:36.584 --> 00:54:38.285]  So you could use that name, go ahead and vote.
[00:54:38.445 --> 00:54:44.667]  Approximately 2.75 million people, two and three quarter million people, are registered in more than one state.
[00:54:45.587 --> 00:54:49.629]  That outlines, I think, the possibility of voter fraud.
[00:54:52.551 --> 00:54:58.994]  All right, now let's go ahead and go to the actual facts.
[00:54:59.014 --> 00:55:02.976]  You go to Paul Joseph Watson's article, he links to all the actual facts, federal statistics, you name it.
[00:55:03.316 --> 00:55:06.018]  Three million votes in presidential election cast by illegal aliens.
[00:55:07.118 --> 00:55:08.459]  Trump may have won popular vote.
[00:55:09.039 --> 00:55:09.400]  November 14, 2016.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:13.682]  Beth Harris, top expert, big liberal.
[00:55:15.731 --> 00:55:30.564]  She said, coming on the show, clear evidence in five states of impossible numbers for Hillary, her getting 100% in precincts, her having massive amounts come in only for her right as they were closing, and that there were evidence of five states being stolen, probably more.
[00:55:31.144 --> 00:55:38.991]  So see, we're not even looking at states they stole or electronically manipulated, because there's a lot of evidence of that, we're just looking at the illegals voting.
[00:55:39.291 --> 00:55:39.972]  So there's that article.
[00:55:40.672 --> 00:55:41.653]  Here's another one out of Bloomberg.
[00:55:41.733 --> 00:55:45.015]  Some cities want their non-citizen immigrants to vote.
[00:55:45.435 --> 00:55:50.118]  And they've caught those cities in 14 different states letting them vote.
[00:55:50.258 --> 00:55:53.340]  Because there's no IDs needed in, what, 20-something states.
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.680]  So what do you think happens?
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:57.402]  The Democrats bus you around with a list of dead people.
[00:55:58.473 --> 00:56:00.015]  It's all about the dead people on the rolls.
[00:56:00.475 --> 00:56:06.941]  There needs to be a law at every state level that when somebody dies, an email is sent and a program and they are removed from the rolls.
[00:56:07.162 --> 00:56:08.063]  That's the way to fix this.
[00:56:08.443 --> 00:56:21.316]  It's all folks who are dead, most of them conservatives and patriots, imagined for four or five years, still on the voter rolls, sometimes longer, with people stealing their identity and stealing their right as a citizen to vote.
[00:56:23.032 --> 00:56:23.712]  Oh, that's Bloomberg.
[00:56:23.812 --> 00:56:25.693]  Oh, they want the illegals to vote, but none of them voted.
[00:56:26.313 --> 00:56:27.353]  Third time a charm.
[00:56:27.413 --> 00:56:31.414]  Fox News, San Francisco to try yet again to give illegal immigrants voting rights.
[00:56:33.114 --> 00:56:35.195]  San Francisco moves to open voting for illegals.
[00:56:35.215 --> 00:56:38.316]  There's some articles sitting, pull them up, but where states passed it out of their houses.
[00:56:38.356 --> 00:56:39.176]  I remember covering those.
[00:56:39.636 --> 00:56:43.337]  Two investigators, Chicago voters cast ballots from beyond the grave.
[00:56:43.377 --> 00:56:44.117]  CBS News.
[00:56:45.265 --> 00:56:45.486]  U.S.
[00:56:45.526 --> 00:56:47.348]  elites buying New Zealand redoubts.
[00:56:47.388 --> 00:56:47.989]  That's coming up.
[00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:49.712]  And then Ron Paul's coming up.
[00:56:49.752 --> 00:56:51.695]  We'll break down this and so much more.
[00:56:51.735 --> 00:56:56.463]  But I gotta say, I am wildly pleased by Trump.
[00:56:57.861 --> 00:56:59.023]  This is pure Americana.
[00:56:59.043 --> 00:57:00.304]  This is the return of the Republic.
[00:57:00.404 --> 00:57:05.411]  Things got so bad that we now identify the clear enemies, what their programs are, and we're resisting them.
[00:57:05.811 --> 00:57:07.233]  I want to thank you all for your support.

[00:58:02.721 --> 00:58:05.802]  We're going to reprint it in kind of a yellower parchment, but I think this looks good.
[00:58:05.822 --> 00:58:10.484]  We're going to bring in Ronald Reagan as well, George Washington, and John Wayne just to piss them off.
[00:58:11.304 --> 00:58:20.851]  Uh, so, uh, this is something we're going to do, because they hate seeing these images of Americana, and we are going to make it fashionable again, liberty fun again, and that's what's happening.
[00:58:20.891 --> 00:58:21.311]  They hate it.
[00:58:22.191 --> 00:58:25.333]  Also, we have an emergency shipment of DNA Force now back in stock.
[00:58:25.654 --> 00:58:29.016]  I am still offering 10% off on that, but a lot of stuff is sold out.

[00:58:40.485 --> 00:58:41.366]  I salute you all.
[00:58:41.486 --> 00:58:42.987]  Hour 2, 70 seconds out.
[00:58:43.648 --> 00:58:44.989]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:58:52.887 --> 00:59:04.211]  ABC has the first one-on-one interview with President Trump, and they are taking ownership of what should be public information, listing unprecedented restrictions on the publishing of that information.
[00:59:04.351 --> 00:59:06.712]  They put limits on how long the excerpts can be.
[00:59:06.912 --> 00:59:09.553]  They put a time limit on how long material can be used.
[00:59:09.653 --> 00:59:12.114]  No material may be used after February the 1st.
[00:59:12.654 --> 00:59:15.797]  They're mandating on-screen credits and on and on.
[00:59:16.057 --> 00:59:17.038]  Understand what's going on.
[00:59:17.218 --> 00:59:23.604]  For political and financial reasons, the mainstream media is trying to maintain a monopoly on information and reporting about the president.
[00:59:23.844 --> 00:59:26.987]  They want to exclude friendly media so that they will control the narrative.
[00:59:27.247 --> 00:59:28.708]  But it's also about profits.
[00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:31.451]  And we can see that as ABC News lawyers up.
[00:59:31.631 --> 00:59:35.875]  Remember that one of the key aspects of the Trans-Pacific Partnership was the copyright issue.
[00:59:36.115 --> 00:59:43.819]  As Infowars has been pointing out for a long time, copyright claims would be used to suppress freedom of speech and to control the political narrative.
[00:59:44.019 --> 00:59:49.842]  To quote Jim Acosta of CNN as he lectured President-elect Trump, that is not appropriate.
[00:59:50.202 --> 00:59:51.963]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:59:54.064 --> 00:59:59.967]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.251 --> 01:00:19.094]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:21.516]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:21.756 --> 01:00:22.897]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:23.438 --> 01:00:29.142]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.423 --> 01:00:35.267]  I knew Trump had something two-plus years ago when the elites were in conniption, fencing hatred against him.
[01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:39.711]  And they really
[01:00:41.974 --> 01:00:44.117]  Did everything they could to stop him and it blew up in their face.
[01:00:44.197 --> 01:00:44.977]  They have collapsed.
[01:00:45.018 --> 01:00:45.698]  They are discredited.
[01:00:46.199 --> 01:00:52.546]  But they do have some cards still up their sleeves and we've got to really be watching for them to try to throw sand in our eyes.
[01:00:55.289 --> 01:00:58.793]  Now there's a story up on DrudgeReport.com on the left hand side.
[01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:02.405]  U.S.
[01:01:02.485 --> 01:01:06.566]  elites buying New Zealand redoubts to escape crack-up of civilization.
[01:01:07.547 --> 01:01:10.387]  Very, very important article.
[01:01:11.108 --> 01:01:22.771]  Now again, we've harped on this quite a bit, but I'm glad that the press is starting to pick up on this more because
[01:01:24.537 --> 01:01:39.129]  The fact that they have been exiting the last six, seven, eight years so quickly, to not just New Zealand, but the Cook Islands, to Kauai, Hawaii, they're not doing this because they don't want to be in the center of things.
[01:01:39.149 --> 01:01:44.534]  The elites want to be in Paris, they want to be in Rome, they want to be in London, they want to be in New York, they want to be in L.A., where it's happening.
[01:01:44.554 --> 01:01:47.617]  They're doing it because there's a very, very good chance
[01:01:48.755 --> 01:01:52.537]  That we could see substantive societal breakdown.
[01:01:52.597 --> 01:01:55.598]  And again, I don't say that to be a fear monger.
[01:01:55.818 --> 01:01:56.778]  I have three children.
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.281]  Most historians, most military analysts said we were getting very close to nuclear war with Russia.
[01:02:05.502 --> 01:02:09.404]  Isn't it a sigh of relief now that that threat has subsided a little bit?
[01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:13.205]  Well, the elite aren't slowing down their exodus.
[01:02:13.966 --> 01:02:14.546]  And this article
[01:02:16.328 --> 01:02:16.908]  Breaks it down.
[01:02:16.968 --> 01:02:20.549]  Wealthy Americans fear impending civil war in the homeland.
[01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:23.230]  Wealthy Americans are preparing for possible U.S.
[01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:29.032]  collapse or revolt by the poor and buying properties in New Zealand, the New Yorker magazine reported.
[01:02:29.052 --> 01:02:35.074]  According to writer Evan Osnos, oh I love how we learn about it from the New Yorker now.
[01:02:35.755 --> 01:02:36.315]  I told you
[01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:42.496]  Eight years ago that elites were moving to New Zealand to get away from a collapse.
[01:02:42.536 --> 01:02:43.917]  Now that doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[01:02:44.198 --> 01:02:48.002]  It means they're being told things in their elite circle that make them think this.
[01:02:48.102 --> 01:02:49.104]  That's why that's important.
[01:02:52.428 --> 01:02:55.752]  According to the report, preppers from Silicon Valley, like Zuckerberg,
[01:02:57.583 --> 01:03:00.605]  And New York are getting ready for the crack-up of civilization.
[01:03:01.206 --> 01:03:10.192]  While they fund Black Lives Matter, all the major Fortune 100, while they fund the communist groups, while they fund the groups that went out and beat up Trump supporters, I was there.
[01:03:11.814 --> 01:03:13.215]  It's so outrageous.
[01:03:14.554 --> 01:03:18.098]  They are funding civil unrest in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in Europe.
[01:03:19.119 --> 01:03:25.005]  Videos pour in every day of people in Sweden, women being gang raped by Muslims.
[01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:30.130]  Or in Spain, a woman was wearing a bracelet.
[01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:44.116]  That just said Spain on it, and a bunch of men beat her half to death, and then the local socialist member of the local town council went on TV and said, this woman is a monster and a pig.
[01:03:44.156 --> 01:03:44.977]  You can go read the quotes.
[01:03:45.417 --> 01:03:46.397]  She deserves it.
[01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:50.920]  But whether you love her or hate her, since when is it okay for the left to beat up women?
[01:03:51.581 --> 01:03:54.162]  I mean, I witnessed it, where bleeding women were walking by me on the street.
[01:03:55.203 --> 01:03:57.264]  They kept telling me, we're being attacked by Black Lives Matter.
[01:03:57.725 --> 01:03:59.766]  And I went down there, and it was like 90% white women.
[01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:03.045]  And little weird white guys.
[01:04:03.985 --> 01:04:05.826]  And then a few whacked out black guys.
[01:04:07.187 --> 01:04:08.027]  Beating people up.
[01:04:09.328 --> 01:04:10.809]  Screaming you're an effing white male.
[01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:13.230]  As they beat up Hispanic and Asian women particularly.
[01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:15.271]  Because they flip out.
[01:04:15.311 --> 01:04:17.792]  They get triggered by somebody that has any color on their skin.
[01:04:19.193 --> 01:04:20.013]  Going to a Trump rally.
[01:04:20.453 --> 01:04:23.355]  I mean how would a black New York Times reporter get in?
[01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:29.331]  They were so dumbed down that even attacked people like that.
[01:04:29.371 --> 01:04:30.192]  Reporters trying to get in.
[01:04:30.372 --> 01:04:31.633]  Or people going, hey, I'm going to work.
[01:04:31.913 --> 01:04:32.794]  See, I got a badge.
[01:04:33.575 --> 01:04:33.795]  No!
[01:04:34.856 --> 01:04:35.576]  You're not going to work.
[01:04:38.179 --> 01:04:39.540]  This is the craziness of these people.
[01:04:40.901 --> 01:04:42.603]  So that report breaks it all down that...
[01:04:43.697 --> 01:04:45.239]  That they are really hightailing it.
[01:04:45.399 --> 01:04:49.925]  They want to have places where they're safe when they organize the civil war, if they need to.
[01:04:50.125 --> 01:04:50.625]  Here's the deal.
[01:04:50.846 --> 01:04:57.854]  We know you're behind it, so don't think you're gonna get away with this and that you won't be touched, whether it's in Kauai or New Zealand.
[01:04:58.335 --> 01:05:00.638]  Understand that, Zuckerberg, and the rest of you.
[01:05:03.552 --> 01:05:10.537]  ABC has the first one-on-one interview with President Trump and they are taking ownership of what should be public information.

[01:05:23.344 --> 01:05:26.466]  They're mandating on-screen credits and on and on.
[01:05:26.746 --> 01:05:29.248]  Understand what's going on for political and financial reasons.
[01:05:29.508 --> 01:05:34.272]  The mainstream media is trying to maintain a monopoly on information and reporting about the president.
[01:05:34.512 --> 01:05:37.654]  They want to exclude friendly media so that they will control the narrative.
[01:05:37.914 --> 01:05:39.375]  But it's also about profits.
[01:05:39.736 --> 01:05:42.138]  And we can see that as ABC News lawyers up.

[01:06:25.894 --> 01:06:33.457]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[01:06:33.737 --> 01:06:43.701]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:06:43.941 --> 01:06:45.842]  And this part is most important.
[01:06:45.982 --> 01:06:52.445]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standards.
[01:06:52.905 --> 01:06:54.827]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.
[01:06:54.887 --> 01:06:55.828]  Minor words and his was action.
[01:06:55.848 --> 01:06:56.628]  His was what he's done to women.
[01:06:56.648 --> 01:06:59.270]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:00.331]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[01:07:00.371 --> 01:07:01.832]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women.
[01:07:22.468 --> 01:07:25.690]  And attack them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:31.113]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[01:07:41.977 --> 01:07:44.699]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[01:07:45.559 --> 01:07:47.020]  It's a fight for our minds.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.621]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:54.144]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:07:54.284 --> 01:07:57.626]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[01:07:57.726 --> 01:07:59.247]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:08:15.598 --> 01:08:20.761]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:08:21.241 --> 01:08:29.145]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:08:29.265 --> 01:08:33.127]  You can say what you want about President Donald Trump.
[01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:52.281]  But he is certainly overthrowing the world order globalist system that had been established, pulling us out of TPP day one, moving to secure the borders, more and more saying he's not going to only talk to mainstream media, the stock market exploding, a lot of positive things.
[01:08:52.321 --> 01:08:53.882]  Now, will the new order
[01:08:54.912 --> 01:08:55.412]  Be perfect?
[01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:56.653]  There's no way that's going to happen.
[01:08:57.273 --> 01:09:09.778]  But undoubtedly, the liberty-based, libertarian, free-market, Von Miesh, Ron Paul movement of the last 30 years, that was such a tiny voice 30-something years ago, is now huge.
[01:09:09.838 --> 01:09:16.201]  It's got to feel good for former congressman and, of course, medical doctor Ron Paul, fellow Texan,
[01:09:17.383 --> 01:09:30.489]  To see his son in the Senate leading the fight for sovereignty and anti-war and to audit the Fed and to see the anti-globalist movement being so popular, not just here, but around the world.
[01:09:30.509 --> 01:09:33.090]  I tell you, the worm has turned.
[01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:34.451]  I'm not saying we're in some utopia.
[01:09:34.531 --> 01:09:38.553]  There's still huge fights ahead and I want to talk about what he's most concerned about.
[01:09:39.193 --> 01:09:42.056]  But I've seen Ron Paul on TV, and I thought, man, that guy looks younger.
[01:09:42.536 --> 01:09:47.161]  And he's joining us via HD video, and I'm like, man, you look 10 years younger.
[01:09:47.201 --> 01:09:47.741]  What's going on?
[01:09:47.761 --> 01:09:50.484]  He said, well, look, it's great not flying back and forth to Congress.
[01:09:50.524 --> 01:09:51.145]  That's what's great.
[01:09:51.545 --> 01:09:54.868]  So it is wonderful, former Congressman Paul, to join us.
[01:09:54.908 --> 01:09:55.209]  Thank you.
[01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.391]  Thank you.
[01:09:57.411 --> 01:09:58.071]  Good to be with you.
[01:09:59.012 --> 01:10:00.594]  Well, where should we start today?
[01:10:03.476 --> 01:10:05.017]  Well, there's so many places.
[01:10:05.677 --> 01:10:06.758]  Government keeps growing.
[01:10:06.798 --> 01:10:07.778]  That bothers me.
[01:10:07.998 --> 01:10:14.241]  I started out a long time ago in the 70s worrying about too much spending, too much debt, and the government's too big.
[01:10:14.982 --> 01:10:17.003]  And supported a lot of people along the way.
[01:10:17.023 --> 01:10:18.823]  And there have been a lot of promises.
[01:10:18.924 --> 01:10:20.524]  And generally I've been disappointed.
[01:10:20.584 --> 01:10:25.547]  You know, the Reagan years were the time when I was most optimistic.
[01:10:26.167 --> 01:10:28.688]  Yet by the end of eight years, I was pretty disappointed.
[01:10:28.788 --> 01:10:30.889]  The spending continued.
[01:10:31.629 --> 01:10:33.790]  Our presence around the world got bigger.
[01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:42.233]  So I'm keeping my fingers crossed on what's going to happen with this administration because I still hear mixed signals, you know, about what's going to happen.
[01:10:42.293 --> 01:10:46.935]  I worry a little bit about the connection that the new administration has with Goldman Sachs.
[01:10:47.015 --> 01:10:55.698]  It used to be we were worried about Goldman Sachs, but it looks like now they've gotten inside the White House and there's something to be concerned about.
[01:10:56.078 --> 01:10:56.699]  And we don't know.
[01:10:56.759 --> 01:11:00.963]  We have to believe that Trump will continue to do what he said he wants to do.
[01:11:01.484 --> 01:11:11.174]  But when some of these individuals, you know, get into the Treasury and they say, hey, you know, I don't know about this out of the Fed business, that might not be a good idea.
[01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:17.381]  So we need Alex to remain vigilant and be careful and call things as we see them.
[01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:26.748]  Dr. Paul, I absolutely agree with you 100%, but if you look at Bannon, who was former Goldman Sachs, he's anti-globalist, pro-America, and they're delivering.
[01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:30.692]  If you look at the other fellow, I mean, he's been anti-NAFTA and GATT.
[01:11:30.752 --> 01:11:43.102]  I mean, can't we say, though, that Trump is really trying to deliver on a lot of promises, pulling us out of TPP day one, signaling that we're going to try to cut our corporate tax so we can be competitive?
[01:11:45.294 --> 01:11:49.377]  Yeah, I think he's changing the whole nature of the international order.
[01:11:50.398 --> 01:11:52.260]  But I don't think we're going to have a less presence.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:12:04.410]  When you hear him talk about going anyplace, everyplace, and we have to totally eradicate an ideological movement, which is radical Islam.
[01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:16.413]  You know, that's sort of like taking on communism, which was an ideological issue that we defeated without a war and without bombing anybody, and they were vicious and mean and nasty.
[01:12:16.793 --> 01:12:27.496]  So yes, it's a mixed bag, but I think what you're talking about is good, because the conventional international order, you know, he does not seem to fit in.
[01:12:27.536 --> 01:12:28.736]  I think he wants to control it.
[01:12:29.096 --> 01:12:32.417]  But there was a time, you know, during the campaign, you and I talked about NATO and
[01:12:32.637 --> 01:12:37.102]  And we, you know, we don't ever get too excited about NATO and going to war for NATO.
[01:12:37.223 --> 01:12:39.025]  And he said some great things about that.
[01:12:39.425 --> 01:12:48.176]  But let's wait and see what happens because some of his appointees sort of like NATO and have indicated that we'll go along.
[01:12:48.536 --> 01:12:48.796]  I don't know.
[01:13:08.038 --> 01:13:08.298]  Yeah.
[01:13:24.552 --> 01:13:29.493]  No indication that the military-industrial complex is going to have less influence.
[01:13:29.813 --> 01:13:36.435]  I'm worried about that, because they won't look at the difference between military spending and defense spending.
[01:13:36.775 --> 01:13:38.595]  They still talk about defense.
[01:13:39.155 --> 01:13:40.695]  Defense spending, defense spending.
[01:13:41.036 --> 01:13:52.238]  I don't want to cut a penny out of defense, but I do want to slash military spending, because it's nothing more than getting us into mischief around the world and incentivizing these people to come and get us.
[01:13:52.998 --> 01:13:55.059]  As long as we do that, we're going to have a problem.
[01:13:55.359 --> 01:14:07.225]  So I want a stronger defense by having a change foreign policy and also to separate the two between military and also, you know, defense.
[01:14:07.525 --> 01:14:12.367]  And I think Trump does say some things about, you know, cracking down on some of the waste and fraud.
[01:14:12.648 --> 01:14:16.349]  But I also think it's very important to know what our policies are.
[01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:19.311]  Are we truly the policemen of the world?
[01:14:19.551 --> 01:14:21.572]  And of course, I think that's a dangerous position.
[01:14:21.952 --> 01:14:24.634]  Well, he did just put a federal hiring freeze in.
[01:14:24.674 --> 01:14:28.297]  He did just announce all these regulations that are designed so companies can't operate are gone.
[01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:30.539]  And I did love one big thing he did.
[01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:38.145]  When he announced we're pulling out of TPP, he didn't reserve it and say he's going to oversee it with Congress and renegotiate it.
[01:14:38.526 --> 01:14:39.767]  He said it's unconstitutional.
[01:14:39.787 --> 01:14:41.228]  They had no authority to negotiate it.
[01:14:41.488 --> 01:14:42.229]  The president didn't.
[01:14:42.309 --> 01:14:43.289]  It's just dead.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:48.707]  I mean, right there, he handed power back to Congress, back to the states, back to the people.
[01:14:48.747 --> 01:14:50.390]  He didn't say, oh, I'm going to renegotiate it.
[01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:51.712]  That's a big sign.
[01:14:51.772 --> 01:14:54.336]  I mean, Ron Paul isn't it?
[01:14:55.336 --> 01:14:59.141]  Exciting, because I know you're not just a cheerleader for Trump.
[01:14:59.381 --> 01:15:03.366]  I'm just super excited because here he is saying Americanism, not globalism.
[01:15:03.766 --> 01:15:05.348]  It's we the people that have the power.
[01:15:05.608 --> 01:15:07.170]  We're going to give the power back to you.
[01:15:07.551 --> 01:15:08.752]  You are what is important.
[01:15:08.952 --> 01:15:13.898]  We have a bunch of elites up here that are arrogant, calling the media out for being fake.
[01:15:13.918 --> 01:15:15.039]  You've exposed that as well.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.081]  I mean, they just do outrageous stuff.
[01:15:17.181 --> 01:15:20.882]  Major media said that I got arrested at the Trump rally and thrown out.
[01:15:21.302 --> 01:15:22.883]  No, they had communists attacking me.
[01:15:23.163 --> 01:15:24.244]  The police protected me.
[01:15:24.344 --> 01:15:29.626]  I mean, the MSM has only seemed to double down in their deception.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:34.844]  Well, you know, I think you're right about the TPP.
[01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:35.464]  I'm delighted.
[01:15:35.485 --> 01:15:37.407]  I don't want to get anywhere close to that.
[01:15:37.467 --> 01:15:39.990]  We need to get rid of the WTO and the U.N.
[01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:41.712]  and all that other business.
[01:15:41.952 --> 01:15:48.881]  But, you know, the freeze on employees of the government has been very limited because he did not put that into the military.
[01:15:48.941 --> 01:15:50.343]  That's not going to be expanded.
[01:15:51.143 --> 01:16:02.231]  So they're going to cut Social Security, which was a proposal of the OMB director, the new one, and they're going to spend more money on the military and not on national defense.
[01:16:02.271 --> 01:16:14.019]  So I think there's some significance there because they don't ever talk about, you know, there are for every hundred people we have in the military, we have 60 civilians in there.
[01:16:14.039 --> 01:16:14.599]  They're involved.
[01:16:14.839 --> 01:16:17.761]  And it's our civilians that go overseas and fight these wars.
[01:16:18.041 --> 01:16:19.222]  And they're the contractor.
[01:16:19.242 --> 01:16:20.263]  They're the Halliburton's.
[01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:29.184]  They're the ones that are on the gravy train, and they're not even counted, you know, and they're not even counted as employees, but it still costs a lot of money.
[01:16:29.225 --> 01:16:37.546]  So if you've been in the military, and you're a grunt, and then you finally go and join Halliburton, then you get over and send it to these areas where we're still fighting.
[01:16:37.566 --> 01:16:40.366]  We're in seven countries right now, and that's what I hope.
[01:16:40.686 --> 01:16:47.888]  In a year from now, if we're in a lot less than seven countries, then I'm going to say, great, move on.
[01:16:48.188 --> 01:16:48.928]  But right now?
[01:16:50.349 --> 01:16:53.953]  I'm watching carefully because I think it's really, really hard.
[01:16:53.993 --> 01:16:57.197]  They use it as an example turning around an aircraft carrier.
[01:16:57.478 --> 01:16:58.819]  It's very, very difficult.
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:06.248]  And the momentum of the military-industrial complex and the influence of Goldman Sachs is so great that it's going to be very, very hard.
[01:17:06.268 --> 01:17:08.631]  Sure, but he did pass... We do have hints from Trump and...
[01:17:09.272 --> 01:17:16.338]  Sure, but he did pass a big test when he de-escalated with Russia, says we shouldn't be massing troops on their border, because that's totally illegitimate.
[01:17:16.578 --> 01:17:30.010]  The problem is Hillary and Obama and Kerry, they've been caught in the memos, the WikiLeaks, Kerry's been caught on tape helping create ISIS out of Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra, Saudi Arabia, they have a deal with them to expand Islamic Jihad, Wahhabism, worldwide.
[01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:32.953]  So I agree with you in your op-ed where you said, you know,
[01:17:33.513 --> 01:17:36.035]  Is Trump being consistent, being anti-war?
[01:17:36.315 --> 01:17:44.260]  But it's not war if we're cleaning up a mess that our own country created with Al-Qaeda pouring into Europe, creating a bigger crisis.
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:49.063]  I mean, isn't it just to go in there and kick them out of Syria, or at least let the Russians do it?
[01:17:51.342 --> 01:17:52.423]  Not from my viewpoint.
[01:17:52.443 --> 01:17:53.744]  This is where we can disagree.
[01:17:54.064 --> 01:17:55.405]  Because I say, just come home.
[01:17:55.466 --> 01:17:57.947]  We've created it, and being there is just going to escalate.
[01:17:58.348 --> 01:18:03.312]  And this whole thing, I think, and I praise Trump when I think he does right, especially with Russia.
[01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:06.974]  Why are these people wanting, the Neocons want to stir up a fight with Russia?
[01:18:07.415 --> 01:18:09.036]  But why do we have to stir up a fight?
[01:18:09.096 --> 01:18:11.397]  Well China's been threatening to attack the U.S.
[01:18:29.122 --> 01:18:29.522]  Sure, sure.
[01:18:29.542 --> 01:18:34.365]  But I mean, China's been, here's the thing, we have agreements with China, and this is the old global order, it's falling apart.
[01:18:34.625 --> 01:18:38.727]  But the reason Trump's making his point is, the old global order, the globalist setup was already falling apart.
[01:18:39.027 --> 01:18:46.871]  China had the deal for exclusive rare earth minerals and manufacturing, we were going to let them dominate that, we would dominate military, they broke that deal.
[01:18:47.352 --> 01:18:50.934]  I disagree, as you do, with the whole deal they've had, you know, since Nixon.
[01:18:51.174 --> 01:18:53.055]  So what do we put in place of that?
[01:18:53.795 --> 01:19:01.398]  I don't want world order, I don't want a world government, but how do we not let the normal evil forces come in then and take advantage of the chaos?
[01:19:03.118 --> 01:19:09.520]  But the people that are dealing with it, you know, there's a mess over in Ukraine and we participated, you know, we precipitated it.
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.581]  Just get out of there and let the local people support this out.
[01:19:12.921 --> 01:19:17.003]  But this whole idea about China and worrying about China attacking the United States, they
[01:19:18.123 --> 01:19:32.761]  We just have one aircraft carrier, you know, and we spend so much, we spend more money than the next 10 countries together, and yet we're still, you're right in criticizing this preparation for war against Russia and Trump wants to settle that down, that's very good.
[01:19:33.142 --> 01:19:34.143]  But why transfer?
[01:19:34.163 --> 01:19:35.545]  That's Kissinger's position.
[01:19:35.925 --> 01:19:43.106]  Keep the Chinese fighting with the Russians and separate the two because we don't want them to be allies.
[01:19:43.326 --> 01:19:46.227]  So now our position is to go after the Chinese.
[01:19:46.247 --> 01:19:54.388]  You know, I was in high school when the Chinese were fighting and killing people, including one of my teachers, who was over in Korea.
[01:19:54.808 --> 01:19:56.789]  And it's so much different now.
[01:19:57.089 --> 01:19:58.249]  I think we should trade.
[01:19:58.449 --> 01:20:02.690]  There's never been any interruption in the South China Sea with the Chinese.
[01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:03.350]  Well, I agree.
[01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:04.350]  I don't want war.
[01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:04.930]  I don't want war.
[01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:10.591]  I don't like him buying up Hollywood and trying to control what we do here.
[01:20:10.831 --> 01:20:14.132]  Let me bring this up, though, because it deals with the press and attacks on freedom.
[01:20:14.412 --> 01:20:24.795]  There's a big call for Trump to move to repeal the law that Obama signed, federalizing media, putting the CIA over it, this Truth Department at the State Department.
[01:20:25.055 --> 01:20:30.276]  There's also all 50 state attorney generals have asked him to not let Homeland Security federalize elections.
[01:20:30.596 --> 01:20:31.716]  You're a constitutionalist.
[01:20:31.936 --> 01:20:34.657]  You're more of an expert than probably any of us on this.
[01:20:35.077 --> 01:20:39.642]  I mean, isn't it already super unconstitutional to have the federal government over the media, A?
[01:20:39.923 --> 01:20:46.030]  And then, B, what about this whole thing where they're calling for homeland security?
[01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:48.213]  Well, they've done it to federalize elections.
[01:20:50.819 --> 01:20:56.427]  Yeah, and that's why I fear, you know, that we're militarizing the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:20:56.847 --> 01:21:05.860]  I think they, and you know darn well, when I thought of Homeland Security after 9-11, I voted adamantly opposed to the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.382]  Now it's bigger than ever.
[01:21:08.323 --> 01:21:21.848]  So, and the CIA, if you're a strict constitutionalist, you allow the gathering of intelligence, but you don't allow the cloak-and-dagger stuff, where the CIA works with these special forces and goes around the world.
[01:21:22.148 --> 01:21:27.790]  And believe me, that is going to accelerate, because we're going to go anywhere, anyplace that there's a suspect.
[01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:33.913]  Not where we've proven anything, but he's suspected that he could commit terrorism, that we're going to go after him.
[01:21:34.213 --> 01:21:36.774]  I say, just get out of this place.
[01:21:37.934 --> 01:21:42.437]  This is how you create the hatred toward us.
[01:21:42.897 --> 01:21:44.998]  People have to understand what blowback really is.
[01:21:45.038 --> 01:21:46.859]  And I'm a strong believer in blowback.
[01:21:47.079 --> 01:21:52.242]  There is a reaction and it incites people who are already borderline in their thinking.
[01:21:52.522 --> 01:21:53.383]  So why do that?
[01:21:53.443 --> 01:21:56.545]  It's like poking at rattlesnakes and jumping into the snakeshelf.
[01:21:59.398 --> 01:21:59.619]  U.N.
[01:21:59.659 --> 01:22:08.491]  President Trump agreed back in 2003, and I was anti-war as you know, you were coming on at the time, pointing out why it was wrong to go into Iraq.
[01:22:08.511 --> 01:22:11.776]  They'd been our ally previous, and they were secular.
[01:22:11.836 --> 01:22:15.061]  I mean, one of the better regimes in the area, certainly not our business.
[01:22:15.641 --> 01:22:17.583]  So Trump was right about that.
[01:22:17.663 --> 01:22:18.444]  You were right about that.
[01:22:18.724 --> 01:22:26.571]  His point is we've got to get this Saudi Arabian expansion under control or it will be an ongoing war and cause crisis.
[01:22:26.631 --> 01:22:30.735]  He wants to actually stamp it out, not go in and stir it up.
[01:22:30.775 --> 01:22:32.096]  He wants to kick it out of the West.
[01:22:32.136 --> 01:22:38.022]  And I do think that Trump is going to be militaristic and basically no limit when it comes to taking out the Islamic Jihad.
[01:22:40.618 --> 01:22:42.800]  Well, cross your fingers on that one, I'll tell you.
[01:22:43.761 --> 01:22:46.084]  I don't think it has anything to do with national defense.
[01:22:46.244 --> 01:22:47.986]  I think that has to do with ego.
[01:22:48.406 --> 01:22:53.112]  And I think the sooner we realize that, the better off we're going to be.
[01:22:53.132 --> 01:22:56.515]  And we have to understand what the reason is.
[01:22:57.316 --> 01:23:05.560]  And Saudi Arabia, I mean, there's people, even the Secretary of State now is somewhat sympathetic to the Saudis.
[01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.482]  And the Saudis are the ones that we, you know, deal with.
[01:23:09.542 --> 01:23:10.963]  Our CIA deals with them.
[01:23:11.263 --> 01:23:17.165]  And they radicalized the Muslims to help defeat the Soviet system in Afghanistan.
[01:23:17.446 --> 01:23:19.907]  And then as time went on, they turned on us.
[01:23:19.967 --> 01:23:22.208]  So I think we should stay out of that.
[01:23:22.728 --> 01:23:27.732]  Yeah, we have to realize that that is very, very dangerous.
[01:23:28.032 --> 01:23:30.073]  There's a lot of problems in the world.
[01:23:31.774 --> 01:23:33.596]  You're a long-term thinker and I respect that.
[01:23:33.796 --> 01:23:34.616]  You're a long-term thinker.
[01:23:34.936 --> 01:23:39.299]  Speaking of media attacks, you have been called basically a Russian agent.
[01:23:39.439 --> 01:23:40.280]  I have been called one.
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:41.561]  Trump has been called one.
[01:23:41.961 --> 01:23:44.063]  All these fake revelations have come out.
[01:23:44.523 --> 01:23:45.444]  None of them are true.
[01:23:45.584 --> 01:23:46.844]  It's totally made up.
[01:23:47.145 --> 01:23:50.647]  And that's how they passed that law to, quote, try to control U.S.
[01:23:50.727 --> 01:23:53.749]  media is because, quote, the Russians are so powerful.
[01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:59.533]  They even claim now that drain the swamp and crooked Hillary came from Putin with no evidence.
[01:23:59.593 --> 01:24:00.674]  What do you make of this?
[01:24:00.694 --> 01:24:03.516]  I mean, this is like McCarthy on PCP.
[01:24:05.814 --> 01:24:07.835]  That was the word I was thinking about as you were saying that.
[01:24:08.115 --> 01:24:09.395]  It's the McCarthyism.
[01:24:09.715 --> 01:24:12.556]  You know, they try to destroy people who come up with a messenger.
[01:24:12.816 --> 01:24:17.377]  You know, somebody called in when my name was on that list and they were a little bit worried about it.
[01:24:17.578 --> 01:24:19.538]  And my staff said, no, that's good news.
[01:24:19.578 --> 01:24:20.198]  That's good news.
[01:24:20.238 --> 01:24:27.901]  We're on the right side, you know, of them attacking us because they want to destroy us because they're afraid of the truth.
[01:24:27.941 --> 01:24:32.502]  You know, we're telling the truth and they have to close you down by demagoguing and lying about us.
[01:24:32.862 --> 01:24:35.705]  So, I think, but I think there are healthy things.
[01:24:35.925 --> 01:24:41.610]  Right now, I think the best thing, and Trump's done a good job on this, is debunking, you know, so much of the media.
[01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:46.234]  There's so little trust in the government, that's why Trump won, and rightfully so.
[01:24:46.554 --> 01:24:53.180]  I think 70-80% of the American people don't even believe what government tells us, but they don't believe the major medias anymore.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:58.905]  So, I don't think we have to lecture them, say, oh, don't believe what, you know, the major media is saying.
[01:24:59.085 --> 01:25:00.346]  They don't believe it anyway.
[01:25:00.686 --> 01:25:04.790]  But we still have a long way to convince people of what the alternative should be.
[01:25:05.130 --> 01:25:08.874]  And of course, I try to be as precise as I can and as balanced as I can.
[01:25:09.234 --> 01:25:20.025]  Because even, I know it's against the rules if you identify as a Republican congressman, that if a Democrat president does something halfway decent, you compliment on.
[01:25:20.325 --> 01:25:24.169]  I happen to think it's a great idea that we can talk to the Cubans.
[01:25:24.449 --> 01:25:28.552]  And if that is cancelled, I think that's a step backwards to the dark ages.
[01:25:28.753 --> 01:25:39.942]  You know, I was drafted during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the longer we sanctioned Cubans and we pestered them like that, the longer Castro stayed in power.
[01:25:40.222 --> 01:25:43.585]  So it's time to get a life and let people go into Cuba.
[01:25:45.046 --> 01:25:52.215]  Your logic has been proven right and President Trump's called you super smart so I hope he'll confer with you and get some of your advice on this.
[01:25:52.296 --> 01:25:55.219]  In the few minutes we've got left, I want to speak about
[01:25:56.383 --> 01:25:58.405]  The nature of the division in this country.
[01:25:58.425 --> 01:26:03.791]  I went out to the so-called female march against Trump on Saturday in DC.
[01:26:04.231 --> 01:26:06.393]  We let them have their march and didn't attack them.
[01:26:06.413 --> 01:26:08.976]  They attacked anybody trying to go into the Trump inauguration.
[01:26:09.316 --> 01:26:11.218]  The media has been caught lying about the numbers.
[01:26:11.338 --> 01:26:12.479]  It's just incredible.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.041]  And I see the division.
[01:26:14.842 --> 01:26:18.505]  I was screamed at over 300 times that I was an effing white male.
[01:26:19.386 --> 01:26:20.926]  By mainly white women.
[01:26:21.587 --> 01:26:29.269]  The Democratic Party has been turned so racist and so mind-controlled, I'm really worried about civil insurrection in this country.
[01:26:29.289 --> 01:26:34.710]  There's a big article out today in New Yorker magazine about that, that the elites are actually leaving the U.S.
[01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:38.911]  So I've been positive so far, but I just hope that Trump can unify the country.
[01:26:39.171 --> 01:26:45.533]  We can come together, as he said, don't conquer the world, you know, with military, but have America be a shining city on the hill.
[01:26:46.193 --> 01:26:50.054]  That our ideas are what, you know, basically spreads across the world.
[01:26:50.074 --> 01:26:55.395]  So, do you have concerns about Soros and others that admit they're trying to fund civil war in America?
[01:26:57.756 --> 01:27:13.079]  Well, I think it's not so much that people are sitting there and working on it, which I'm sure there are some that do that, but I think policies that we have designed, you know, incrementally over the last hundred years have worked us into this position because it's a failed system.
[01:27:13.499 --> 01:27:26.088]  Just as Mises lectured many, many years before communism failed, he explained why socialism always fails, and communism would fail, and we didn't have to have a fight in a war with them.
[01:27:26.949 --> 01:27:35.175]  But the same rules apply to Keynesianism, interventionism, Federal Reserve inflationism, militarism.
[01:27:35.535 --> 01:27:36.336]  It fails.
[01:27:36.576 --> 01:27:38.858]  All empires end, and we're the empire.
[01:27:39.258 --> 01:27:40.319]  And it's going to end.
[01:27:40.379 --> 01:27:41.881]  It's going to be for economic reasons.
[01:27:41.921 --> 01:27:43.923]  It's not because the Russians are coming.
[01:27:43.943 --> 01:27:46.245]  And it's not going to be because the Chinese are coming.
[01:27:46.285 --> 01:27:47.787]  And the Iranians aren't going to get us.
[01:27:48.327 --> 01:27:53.192]  And we're going to fail because we're working with a failed system, especially in this century.
[01:27:53.212 --> 01:27:56.075]  In the last 17 years, it's been a disaster.
[01:27:56.215 --> 01:28:00.580]  And Trump was able to recognize this and go to the people who have suffered the most.
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.422]  But this is a monetary problem.
[01:28:02.662 --> 01:28:04.183]  This is a spending problem.
[01:28:04.503 --> 01:28:06.284]  This is a foreign policy problem.
[01:28:06.784 --> 01:28:09.026]  And that is what's going to bring us down.
[01:28:09.086 --> 01:28:10.547]  It's going to be financial.
[01:28:10.847 --> 01:28:17.391]  And it's going to be associated with horrendous increases in spending and also inflation.
[01:28:17.711 --> 01:28:23.594]  And yet we still have a policy where they deliberately try to devalue our dollar.
[01:28:24.895 --> 01:28:28.378]  How long do you think Trump has to try to reverse that because we're so far down the road?
[01:28:28.418 --> 01:28:30.881]  I know he's making hundreds of calls a day to get jobs back.
[01:28:31.181 --> 01:28:32.362]  He does want to cut taxes.
[01:28:32.402 --> 01:28:33.563]  He also wants to cut spending.
[01:28:33.823 --> 01:28:35.445]  I mean, what needs to be done to right the ship?
[01:28:37.551 --> 01:28:43.975]  Well, I'll tell you what, he has a short amount of time, and I think he's sincerely trying, and when he talks about taxes and regulation, I think he's doing a great job.
[01:28:44.755 --> 01:28:55.242]  But, the whole thing is, let's say there's some dire predictions that, you know, next year, or say a year, 18 months, we have something arriving worse than 2008 and 2009.
[01:28:55.702 --> 01:28:58.404]  The downturn is much worse.
[01:28:58.904 --> 01:29:01.526]  And they'll say, ah, it's all Trump's fault, it's all Trump's fault.
[01:29:01.906 --> 01:29:02.947]  No, it wasn't.
[01:29:03.467 --> 01:29:06.349]  2008 and 2009 wasn't Obama's fault.
[01:29:06.669 --> 01:29:12.432]  It was the fault of the Federal Reserve, it was the fault of the Keynesian economic model, the spending too much, the deficit.
[01:29:12.833 --> 01:29:16.235]  So, unfortunately, there's nothing he can do.
[01:29:16.355 --> 01:29:17.235]  Trump can't do it.
[01:29:17.615 --> 01:29:24.379]  He can help, you know, by some of these policies, but you can't avoid the correction.
[01:29:24.399 --> 01:29:30.363]  The correction is locked in place because the deficits are there, the malinvestment, everybody agrees.
[01:29:30.643 --> 01:29:31.124]  We're on the
[01:29:53.937 --> 01:29:55.479]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.499 --> 01:29:57.261]  I'm gonna have comments when I come back on this.
[01:29:57.281 --> 01:29:58.463]  This is a huge interview.
[01:29:58.483 --> 01:29:59.244]  Very important, folks.
[01:29:59.264 --> 01:29:59.644]  Stay with us.
[01:29:59.765 --> 01:30:00.706]  Paul Watson coming up as well.
[01:30:01.086 --> 01:30:01.747]  Thank you, Dr. Paul.
[01:30:03.169 --> 01:30:09.317]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[01:30:09.897 --> 01:30:11.299]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[01:30:12.182 --> 01:30:14.063]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[01:30:14.683 --> 01:30:20.245]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[01:30:20.825 --> 01:30:28.808]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[01:30:28.828 --> 01:30:31.289]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[01:30:31.569 --> 01:30:35.791]  This is the best system out there, and we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[01:30:36.051 --> 01:30:36.791]  This is how it works.
[01:30:37.091 --> 01:30:37.611]  You order.
[01:30:37.731 --> 01:30:38.532]  Customized or
[01:30:39.637 --> 01:30:41.098]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[01:30:41.578 --> 01:30:44.720]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:49.082]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[01:30:49.302 --> 01:30:50.083]  You cannot lose.
[01:30:50.103 --> 01:30:51.204]  You're funding the Infowar.
[01:30:51.524 --> 01:30:58.267]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[01:30:58.588 --> 01:31:02.530]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:15.136]  ABC has the first one-on-one interview with President Trump, and they are taking ownership of what should be public information, listing unprecedented restrictions on the publishing of that information.
[01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:20.959]  They're mandating on-screen credits, mandating that any excerpts must be introduced with an audio credit.
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:23.701]  They put limits on how long the excerpts can be.
[01:31:23.861 --> 01:31:26.642]  They put a time limit on how long material can be used.
[01:31:26.762 --> 01:31:29.204]  No material may be used after February the 1st.
[01:31:29.784 --> 01:31:35.349]  This is a desperate bid by ABC to circumvent freedom of the press and fair use.
[01:31:35.689 --> 01:31:45.677]  They're trying to take control of Trump's message, trying to monopolize it, both to monetize it and to spin it as they wish for political purposes, even banning future use of it.
[01:31:46.057 --> 01:31:51.662]  Extraordinary copyright claims and enforcement were a major problem with the TPP that Trump just shut down.
[01:31:51.822 --> 01:31:57.667]  And he should shut down this desperate attempt by ABC to try to copyright what the president says in interviews.
[01:31:58.067 --> 01:31:59.971]  That is not appropriate.
[01:31:59.991 --> 01:32:02.075]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:32:02.938 --> 01:32:12.684]  Hey folks, I'm on break right now, and these incredible 2000 lithograph prints came in, and we've already sold out of 500 of them, so thank you for the support.
[01:32:12.725 --> 01:32:13.785]  But listen, they're only $19.95.
[01:32:13.885 --> 01:32:23.131]  If you buy these in art houses across the country, they're as much as $200 a piece, especially one of Reagan, because it's the most iconic.
[01:32:23.151 --> 01:32:27.634]  We're going to be carrying these soon, we hope, but again, he has to produce a limited edition.
[01:32:27.915 --> 01:32:28.375]  Let me show you.
[01:32:28.655 --> 01:32:30.738]  You can read all about the artist and more.
[01:32:31.358 --> 01:32:33.220]  But he sent this to us months ago.
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:36.324]  One is signed to me.
[01:32:36.344 --> 01:32:37.365]  11-8-2016.
[01:32:37.926 --> 01:32:40.409]  Simply amazing.
[01:32:40.689 --> 01:32:44.674]  Right over here is his super famous Reagan photo.
[01:32:45.754 --> 01:32:46.234]  Or drawing.
[01:32:46.274 --> 01:32:49.976]  Now, this is kind of a dark hallway, but you've got to go to the website and see for yourself.
[01:32:50.176 --> 01:32:54.017]  But it doesn't do it justice until you see the parchment paper and the print.
[01:32:54.437 --> 01:32:56.718]  Nobody has ever sold something of this quality for $9.95.
[01:32:56.778 --> 01:32:59.139]  There's only 1,500 of these left.
[01:32:59.559 --> 01:33:00.640]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:01.500]  Thanks for your support.
[01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:08.351]  We are on the march.
[01:33:08.391 --> 01:33:09.752]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:09.832 --> 01:33:12.694]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:12.814 --> 01:33:15.416]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you I'm your man.
[01:33:15.436 --> 01:33:22.422]  You win some, lose some, you do the same to me.
[01:33:22.462 --> 01:33:29.867]  The pleasure is to play.
[01:33:30.128 --> 01:33:34.091]  Faith or death is what you say.
[01:33:40.432 --> 01:33:41.316]  It's the Ace of Spades.
[01:33:41.717 --> 01:33:43.062]  The Ace of Spades.
[01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:48.456]  All right ladies and gentlemen we are live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:49.296 --> 01:33:50.317]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:33:50.798 --> 01:33:53.700]  Paul Watson's about to take over for the balance of the transmission.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:34:06.511]  I'm working on some really really big stories and a lot of things we're getting ready to launch and so I've got to take care of some of that but I will be obviously back tonight on the nightly news and more and back tomorrow but it's great to have Paul Watson step in.
[01:34:06.551 --> 01:34:09.693]  He doesn't fill in, he steps in and does a great job.
[01:34:09.713 --> 01:34:09.973]  He is a
[01:34:10.714 --> 01:34:17.018]  He's a titan now of resistance against the globalists and it's so good to see him grow and get stronger and stronger.
[01:34:17.038 --> 01:34:24.824]  I hope to someday soon see a lot of people on the scene that are doing a better job than I do because I want to defeat the globalists.
[01:34:25.564 --> 01:34:30.207]  And I'm here putting out the information, the intelligence, the facts that will beat them.
[01:34:30.267 --> 01:34:33.770]  Now, this is an addendum to Ron Paul that was just on with us.
[01:34:34.952 --> 01:34:40.978]  He has a very moral view of the world, and he does it from a purist perspective.
[01:34:41.018 --> 01:34:54.751]  The problem is, there's a globalist program to turn radical Islam loose, worldwide, to basically take over the West, ally with the Left, so that we have to adopt speech control, or the, quote, Muslims will kill us.
[01:34:55.912 --> 01:34:56.532]  That's the plan.
[01:34:57.433 --> 01:34:59.415]  Go take out the radical Islamist enemies.
[01:35:00.455 --> 01:35:04.676]  Put them in place, let them enter Europe, enter Africa, enter Asia and take over.
[01:35:06.096 --> 01:35:07.117]  Use them to attack Russia.
[01:35:07.217 --> 01:35:08.217]  They have to be dealt with.
[01:35:08.357 --> 01:35:09.257]  They've been turned loose.
[01:35:09.477 --> 01:35:13.238]  I've been anti-war because I knew it was part of a plan to stir the pot up.
[01:35:13.618 --> 01:35:18.399]  I could read the white papers written by the Project for an American Century, bipartisan neocons.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:20.920]  I understand their plan.
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:25.581]  So I see Paul's perspective and I'm not saying he's wrong in his purest position.
[01:35:26.618 --> 01:35:42.990]  The globalists are going to go to China and others and build them up to go after us and they're going to start provocations unless we're so strong there's nothing they can do and they're totally dominated by the sheer will of our economy, the strength of our defense, and the power of our culture.
[01:35:43.570 --> 01:35:50.415]  And Trump's the man to deliver that and give us the new American millennium, not the new American century.
[01:35:51.496 --> 01:35:52.217]  Now that's the plan.
[01:35:53.724 --> 01:35:59.869]  It's moral, it's strong, it's extremely virile and male, and it's total Americana.
[01:36:01.891 --> 01:36:06.115]  This is what John Wayne was an image of.
[01:36:06.875 --> 01:36:07.716]  John Wayne wasn't.
[01:36:07.836 --> 01:36:11.099]  John was a great guy, but this is the real deal.
[01:36:13.261 --> 01:36:15.443]  And Trump is the real deal.
[01:36:15.483 --> 01:36:18.826]  You heard Paul earlier say, and he normally doesn't have compliments for people,
[01:36:20.106 --> 01:36:23.667]  In power, he said, no, he's doing a great job trying to stop the country collapsing.
[01:36:24.448 --> 01:36:25.528]  No, he's doing the right thing.
[01:36:25.608 --> 01:36:27.089]  No, we're in a death spiral.
[01:36:27.409 --> 01:36:31.951]  We're in a meltdown crisis and he doesn't think Trump can even save us.
[01:36:34.071 --> 01:36:35.292]  That's why Trump is on the phone.
[01:36:39.443 --> 01:36:41.645]  He doesn't even go on TV and tell you what he's doing.
[01:36:41.665 --> 01:36:49.410]  It's something about holding back the fact that he's really working so hard and just not even telling you and just letting you see the results.
[01:36:50.010 --> 01:36:57.415]  Hundreds of phone calls, dozens of meetings a day with business leaders saying it's all going to collapse if you don't start hiring people and paying them good and not ripping them off.
[01:36:57.675 --> 01:37:00.097]  Globalism is about making people poor and controlling them.
[01:37:00.277 --> 01:37:01.298]  This is a bunch of bull.
[01:37:01.938 --> 01:37:09.083]  And now it's all going to collapse and then your money's not going to be worth anything even though you'll have trillions of it because the people are all going to want to kill you.
[01:37:10.144 --> 01:37:13.206]  And that's why all the globalists are running to the hills right now.
[01:37:13.566 --> 01:37:14.486]  That's in the news today.
[01:37:14.526 --> 01:37:17.168]  It's up on InfoWars.com and DrugReport.com.
[01:37:18.429 --> 01:37:18.649]  U.S.
[01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:22.011]  elites buying New Zealand redoubts to escape crack-up of civilization.
[01:37:22.051 --> 01:37:22.972]  How long have you heard that?
[01:37:23.052 --> 01:37:24.593]  Now it's in the New Yorker magazine.
[01:37:24.633 --> 01:37:26.534]  Now it's in the New York Times.
[01:37:26.554 --> 01:37:27.575]  And I'm going to say something right now.
[01:37:27.595 --> 01:37:31.237]  I have mixed feelings about this, and I'm going to ask Paul Watson about this in a moment.
[01:37:31.277 --> 01:37:32.118]  I'm going to hand the baton to him.
[01:37:33.863 --> 01:37:34.623]  I want a D.C.
[01:37:34.643 --> 01:37:40.586]  Bureau so we can have whistleblowers on the street stuff, cover demonstrations, do interviews in our own studios.
[01:37:40.926 --> 01:37:46.768]  I don't so much care about sitting there asking questions of Spicer, even though that would get him forwards in the news and get good questions in there.
[01:37:47.908 --> 01:37:51.590]  I haven't even asked yet for press credentials, and I know if we ask, we've been told we're going to get them.
[01:37:51.630 --> 01:37:52.610]  In fact, it's even been mentioned.
[01:37:52.810 --> 01:37:55.151]  Hey, how about Paul Watson as the White House correspondent?
[01:37:56.252 --> 01:37:57.132]  Will Byrd said that.
[01:37:59.053 --> 01:37:59.793]  A little bird.
[01:38:00.714 --> 01:38:03.516]  Anyways, so, that's a good nickname.
[01:38:04.196 --> 01:38:06.078]  That'd be the code name around here for the little bird.
[01:38:06.918 --> 01:38:10.240]  And, baby parakeet, that's even better.
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:12.101]  A baby parakeet said that.
[01:38:12.482 --> 01:38:18.486]  So, so in this whole Twilight Zone situation, we don't need to be in Washington to like be big wigs and all this, I can't stand it.
[01:38:20.667 --> 01:38:26.471]  But still, seeing Trump, and I know he knows what he's doing, he's trying to get the New York Times and ABC to stop it.
[01:38:27.383 --> 01:38:29.624]  But they're owned by globalists that are at war with you, sir.
[01:38:29.824 --> 01:38:30.484]  They're not going to quit.
[01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:36.146]  So he gives the first big exclusive to ABC that's out to get him.
[01:38:36.206 --> 01:38:38.727]  OK, maybe it's going to be a somewhat fair interview.
[01:38:39.027 --> 01:38:39.687]  Look at CNN.
[01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:44.049]  Spicer keeps going to CNN saying, no, maybe he didn't even win.
[01:38:44.289 --> 01:38:45.489]  Maybe he's not even president.
[01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:46.690]  Talk about fake news.
[01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:50.391]  These are the people that just a few days ago are still saying,
[01:38:51.653 --> 01:39:00.988]  That Trump had almost no one at his rally, no one at his inauguration, total lie, or that the bust of Martin Luther was thrown out the window.
[01:39:01.991 --> 01:39:04.232]  I mean, I would have said, hey, you don't get a question.
[01:39:04.252 --> 01:39:05.653]  You're fake news, just like Trump did.
[01:39:06.013 --> 01:39:08.974]  Follow the boss's lead, Spicer.
[01:39:09.014 --> 01:39:10.555]  And Spicer's great, okay?
[01:39:11.195 --> 01:39:13.677]  I know you're a nice guy, Spicer, and I think you're doing a good job, okay?
[01:39:13.917 --> 01:39:15.577]  Since you've actually been in there, I'm impressed.
[01:39:15.958 --> 01:39:17.498]  I didn't like some of the softball stuff earlier.
[01:39:18.019 --> 01:39:21.580]  But just stop being so nice to these people.
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:23.401]  You're not going to get CNN on your side.
[01:39:23.581 --> 01:39:25.362]  You're not going to get MSNBC on your side.
[01:39:25.662 --> 01:39:27.203]  Do you understand that?
[01:39:29.591 --> 01:39:30.071]  It's crazy.
[01:39:30.131 --> 01:39:36.536]  So before I go to Paul and get his take on this and then I eject onto my next mission, we need your financial support now than ever.
[01:39:36.977 --> 01:39:39.839]  We'll put a bureau in New York, one in London, one in L.A.
[01:39:40.099 --> 01:39:42.301]  to cover what the enemy's doing, to dominate coverage.
[01:39:43.277 --> 01:39:46.599]  And we'll have a bigger effect if more reporters here, uh, if people buy the products.
[01:39:46.659 --> 01:39:55.283]  I mean, we've got great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, open-pollinated, incredible nutraceuticals, incredible nanotech body armor that we're the exclusive.
[01:39:55.763 --> 01:39:57.684]  Only the Defense Department and State Police have this.
[01:39:57.724 --> 01:40:00.826]  We've just been given the exclusive because the Patriots know we're Patriots.
[01:40:03.027 --> 01:40:03.707]  It's all available.
[01:40:03.787 --> 01:40:04.568]  Infowarsstore.com.

[01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:17.879]  We're the exclusive distributor of the Department of Defense wide system that's been adopted.
[01:40:17.899 --> 01:40:19.161]  12 years of research.
[01:40:21.405 --> 01:40:27.190]  As colloidal silver is one of the only other alternatives out there when stuff stops working, this is a new system that knocks it all out.
[01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.950]  Go read.
[01:40:28.251 --> 01:40:30.132]  This is unbelievable.
[01:40:30.412 --> 01:40:36.757]  Combat wipes, cleanup systems, it's got the wipes, it's got the gels, it's got just all of it.
[01:40:36.777 --> 01:40:42.262]  The full family of Combat One, exclusively available for InfoWars listeners.
[01:40:43.936 --> 01:40:44.896]  We just started selling it.
[01:40:44.976 --> 01:40:46.097]  It is very affordable.
[01:40:46.277 --> 01:40:49.078]  There are no reviews yet, but we have the backpacks.
[01:40:49.118 --> 01:40:49.719]  We have all of it.
[01:40:49.739 --> 01:40:50.599]  A lot of new products.

[01:40:58.223 --> 01:41:07.407]  And ladies and gentlemen, I cannot stress to you enough how important it is in this war to have money.
[01:41:08.476 --> 01:41:19.123]  Because, again, I'm a big national syndicated talk show host, and most guys would just have a webmaster, some people, do regular radio advertising, and I could live in a mansion and have a jet airplane.
[01:41:19.864 --> 01:41:22.005]  I don't want to live in a mansion or have a jet airplane, okay?
[01:41:22.866 --> 01:41:24.006]  I'm not saying you're bad if you do.
[01:41:24.747 --> 01:41:30.971]  The point is, that's what the other five or six big rich talk show hosts, there's only a few other peers I've got, and my show's bigger than all of them now.
[01:41:31.351 --> 01:41:31.932]  It's just a fact.
[01:41:32.172 --> 01:41:32.712]  I'm not bragging.
[01:41:32.912 --> 01:41:33.332]  It's a fact.
[01:41:33.533 --> 01:41:34.573]  We're the biggest thing there is.
[01:41:34.593 --> 01:41:35.434]  Let me give you the newsflash.
[01:41:37.537 --> 01:41:43.671]  We're getting up there in terrestrial radio, 250 plus affiliates, and I mean big ones, but on the internet, total domination.
[01:41:44.152 --> 01:41:45.195]  But I take the money.
[01:41:46.226 --> 01:41:49.309]  That we get, and that we generate, because we don't get big corporate sponsors.
[01:41:49.329 --> 01:41:52.571]  We have to direct sell to you, and I take it, I put it back into the fight.
[01:41:52.992 --> 01:41:59.757]  Doesn't mean I don't have a car that runs good, made in America, doesn't mean I don't live in a house, you know, so I got, you know, four kids or whatever so they can be comfortable.
[01:42:00.258 --> 01:42:10.326]  The point is, the three kids, the point is, joke about myself, is that you're investing in the absolute annihilation of the globalists, and bringing in a new system.
[01:42:11.482 --> 01:42:17.807]  You heard Paul say, I don't think Trump's really getting rid of American influence, he's just getting rid of who controls it, and that's right.
[01:42:17.867 --> 01:42:27.635]  The truth is, this is America, America first, and Trump's really grabbing the whole power structure we paid for, that they hijacked, back to America, where we really will dominate.
[01:42:28.216 --> 01:42:37.924]  But hopefully through ideas and being good people, and then not having to pay for it, as he hands it back to Japan and Europe, and then they handle their own defense, and then they don't start telling us that they're the boss.
[01:42:38.643 --> 01:42:39.343]  Because that's what's happened.
[01:42:39.363 --> 01:42:41.163]  The globalists are now dictating to us.
[01:42:41.424 --> 01:42:44.084]  They were planning on absorbing us, the system we built.
[01:42:44.364 --> 01:42:44.864]  No, no, no.
[01:42:44.904 --> 01:42:45.524]  That's not happening.
[01:42:45.724 --> 01:42:48.305]  There's going to be a new negotiation about this whole thing.
[01:42:48.545 --> 01:42:49.585]  And that's why they're so upset.
[01:42:49.665 --> 01:42:51.605]  This is legendary what's happening.
[01:42:51.645 --> 01:42:54.106]  It's a counter-coup within their coup against us.
[01:42:54.906 --> 01:42:57.507]  And you heard Paul say he's doing a great job.
[01:42:57.527 --> 01:43:00.227]  We've got to get behind him on this because he's trying to save us on the economy.
[01:43:00.427 --> 01:43:02.047]  And that's all that matters is the economy.
[01:43:02.287 --> 01:43:04.768]  At the end of the day, Paul said, because that's how they control us.
[01:43:06.744 --> 01:43:09.506]  Ron Paul is taking a lot of steps towards Trump right now.
[01:43:09.886 --> 01:43:10.666]  That's a big deal.
[01:43:10.706 --> 01:43:12.788]  That shows you how real Trump is.
[01:43:13.528 --> 01:43:15.089]  Even though Trump drug his son to the mud.
[01:43:15.409 --> 01:43:17.090]  But, Rand started it.
[01:43:17.310 --> 01:43:18.131]  And I love Rand.
[01:43:18.631 --> 01:43:20.312]  Last time Rand was on, he called to be on the show.
[01:43:23.622 --> 01:43:26.225]  And again, people think, oh, getting one of these guys on the show is that big a deal.
[01:43:26.365 --> 01:43:29.828]  No, it's the stories, it's the analysis, it's what we're doing.
[01:43:30.088 --> 01:43:39.457]  But, going back to Paul, Paul, it is irritating, though, that I haven't asked for another interview with Trump, not even just the last time, I didn't even bring it up last time I talked to him.
[01:43:41.377 --> 01:43:45.078]  But just to see them being nice to CNN, nice to ABC, nice to the New York Times.
[01:43:45.418 --> 01:43:49.119]  These guys might write one decent story but then a hundred other lies.
[01:43:49.419 --> 01:43:50.959]  They just get more worse and worse.
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:56.381]  So his instinct to call them fake news and ignore them is the way to go not to work with them.
[01:43:56.401 --> 01:44:00.942]  We'll see what happens but Drudge is reporting on this ABC News thing where they're claiming there's total copyright.
[01:44:01.122 --> 01:44:04.623]  Well there is no copyright on news if we're analyzing it and covering it.
[01:44:04.983 --> 01:44:10.648]  So they're clearly trying to set up a fight, too, with new media to claim we can't analyze their propaganda.
[01:44:10.788 --> 01:44:11.308]  Well, guess what?
[01:44:11.388 --> 01:44:13.130]  I'm going to call them on that.
[01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:14.591]  I'll tell them to fill their hand.
[01:44:14.811 --> 01:44:18.715]  We're going to play parts of it, and we're going to analyze it, and we're going to talk about it.
[01:44:19.015 --> 01:44:20.396]  So this just gets crazier and crazier.
[01:44:20.416 --> 01:44:22.558]  Paul, tell me what you think about that, and then take over.
[01:44:23.732 --> 01:44:24.532]  Well, thanks Alex.
[01:44:24.572 --> 01:44:33.497]  Yeah, it's a subject that I'm going to hit on today, throughout the rest of the hour and a quarter we've got left, which is this phenomenon that keeps happening every single day.
[01:44:33.917 --> 01:44:43.321]  The fake news media lecturing us like we're the fake news, when they keep coming up with these absolutely insane, ridiculous things.
[01:44:43.661 --> 01:44:49.064]  PGay, you know, the entire WikiLeaks scandal where they were exposed as a Hillary Clinton mouthpiece.
[01:44:49.764 --> 01:44:56.349]  These inauguration crowds, the MLK bust, they keep getting exposed as being fake news over and over again.
[01:44:56.709 --> 01:45:00.632]  Yeah, every day lecturing us as if they've got the moral authority.
[01:45:00.652 --> 01:45:01.332]  That's right, Paul, take over!
[01:45:01.352 --> 01:45:02.954]  You don't have the moral authority.
[01:45:03.194 --> 01:45:04.275]  Take over, Paul, I'm out of here.
[01:45:04.295 --> 01:45:05.996]  By these inauguration crowds.
[01:45:06.056 --> 01:45:07.577]  We never really came back to this.
[01:45:07.637 --> 01:45:10.659]  This kind of disappeared over the last few days.
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:13.841]  In fact, there's an article which they can put up on screen now.
[01:45:14.722 --> 01:45:19.397]  It's called the highest quality photograph of Trump's inauguration yet has been released.
[01:45:19.517 --> 01:45:20.922]  Guess what the crowd looks like?
[01:45:21.809 --> 01:45:27.214]  And this high-quality gigapixel image was released by none other than CNN.
[01:45:27.935 --> 01:45:44.891]  Of course, after CNN and all these other news outlets had banged on for days about how there was virtually nobody at Trump's inauguration, showing images from hours before the inauguration even took place, deliberately lying to their viewers.
[01:45:45.652 --> 01:45:47.293]  Yeah, every single day we get bashed.
[01:45:47.413 --> 01:45:48.214]  Oh, you're fake news.
[01:45:48.234 --> 01:45:49.015]  You're making this up.
[01:45:49.095 --> 01:45:49.895]  You made a mistake.
[01:45:50.556 --> 01:45:51.437]  We make mistakes.
[01:45:51.517 --> 01:45:52.517]  Everyone makes mistakes.
[01:45:52.578 --> 01:45:54.659]  We don't deliberately lie to our audience.
[01:45:54.719 --> 01:45:57.081]  There you see the gigapixel picture.
[01:45:57.461 --> 01:46:03.126]  There, if you just pause on that one, that was the original tweet sent out by a reporter.
[01:46:03.526 --> 01:46:06.148]  Got something like 55,000 retweets.
[01:46:06.508 --> 01:46:13.274]  This was the basis of the fake news story that they all ran with and said, look, Obama's inauguration 2009 on the left.
[01:46:14.975 --> 01:46:20.278]  And yes, you would expect Obama to get more anyway, because most of his voters were in DC to begin with.
[01:46:20.938 --> 01:46:23.739]  But then they said, oh, look on the right, this is Trump's crowd.
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:25.540]  Hardly anyone there.
[01:46:26.001 --> 01:46:29.362]  And look at that, what's that, 55,000 retweets or something?
[01:46:30.363 --> 01:46:35.966]  That was the foundation for the fake news story, and they never even corrected themselves.
[01:46:36.386 --> 01:46:44.230]  I mean, Sean Spicer had to get up in front of CNN reporters and others who were still accusing him of lying.
[01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:53.657]  When they admittedly lied about this, and they were also saying, oh but surely Reagan had more viewers overall, if you included everything.
[01:46:54.038 --> 01:46:59.483]  If you included television, people physically in attendance, the internet, surely Reagan had more.
[01:47:00.183 --> 01:47:02.785]  And Spicer was like, what on earth are you talking about?
[01:47:03.146 --> 01:47:04.827]  The internet didn't exist in 1981!
[01:47:07.029 --> 01:47:20.399]  Of course Donald Trump had more viewers of his inauguration than Ronald Reagan did in 1981, if you include television, the internet, global broadcasts, tablets, phones, everything.
[01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:29.926]  And yet this fake news reporter still kept on saying, oh but surely Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan got 41 million, surely he got more.
[01:47:29.946 --> 01:47:32.548]  It's like, no, the internet didn't exist in 1981.
[01:47:34.611 --> 01:47:45.734]  So again, they engage in the most brazen, outrageous, fake news lies over and over again, and then they get up every single day and lecture us about being fake news.
[01:47:46.374 --> 01:47:48.154]  And I'll give you another example of that.
[01:47:48.994 --> 01:47:55.796]  You had a comedian, Steven Spinola, who back on January 20th sent out a tweet
[01:47:56.670 --> 01:48:06.598]  That said, quote, that was his joke about a 10-year-old kid, okay?
[01:48:07.038 --> 01:48:14.464]  Now I'm all for offensive free speech, I don't think that's particularly funny, but I'm also for taking responsibility for it.
[01:48:14.804 --> 01:48:28.490]  So of course if he sends out a sick joke about a 10-year-old kid, and I mean let's be honest, kids should be completely off limits anyway, if he sends out a joke about a 10-year-old child being a date rapist, then he's gonna get some heat, right?
[01:48:29.051 --> 01:48:31.192]  But not only that, he followed it up with this tweet.
[01:48:31.972 --> 01:48:37.334]  He said, I don't want my mom to get raped, but if she does, I hope it's by Barron Trump.
[01:48:38.055 --> 01:48:41.556]  Small pee-pee would be painless and we'd win lots of money in court.
[01:48:42.036 --> 01:48:42.336]  OK?
[01:48:42.356 --> 01:48:44.037]  This is a left-wing comedian.
[01:48:44.317 --> 01:48:45.518]  He followed that up.
[01:48:46.158 --> 01:48:54.441]  Oh, he went further by basically ridiculing Terri Schiavo, who was a brain-damaged woman who died.
[01:48:54.501 --> 01:48:58.083]  She had a feeding tube removed about, what was it, 12 years ago now?
[01:48:58.962 --> 01:49:03.385]  So, not enough to ridicule a 10-year-old boy and say he's a date rapist to be.
[01:49:03.425 --> 01:49:08.629]  No, let's also ridicule a brain-damaged woman that died 12 years ago.
[01:49:09.649 --> 01:49:10.970]  That's how classy the left is.
[01:49:11.010 --> 01:49:12.752]  But OK, it's free speech.
[01:49:13.372 --> 01:49:14.653]  It's offensive, whatever.
[01:49:15.273 --> 01:49:17.115]  I'm for offensive free speech, OK?
[01:49:17.675 --> 01:49:27.022]  But then Business Insider, after I wrote an article on this, three days after he had tweeted it out and it had already been circulating on the internet,
[01:49:27.702 --> 01:49:32.367]  This Business Insider individual called Oliver Darcy came out with this article.
[01:49:32.387 --> 01:49:33.188]  Okay, so...
[01:49:42.694 --> 01:49:58.103]  The bigger problem was not a comedian calling a 10-year-old child a date rapist-to-be, saying that this child raped his mother, saying that a brain-damaged woman... Ridiculing a brain-damaged woman who died 12 years ago now.
[01:49:59.261 --> 01:50:00.242]  That's all okay.
[01:50:00.702 --> 01:50:08.328]  I'm bad because I used the word Comedy Central Writer rather than Comedy Central Contributor.
[01:50:09.269 --> 01:50:13.533]  In his own bio, Spinola said he was a Comedy Central Contributor.
[01:50:14.313 --> 01:50:17.676]  So, obviously if you contribute something, then you're writing it.
[01:50:17.756 --> 01:50:18.356]  It's comedy.
[01:50:19.197 --> 01:50:27.444]  So again, the biggest scandal is me for saying that he was a Comedy Central Writer when I should have said he was a Comedy Central Contributor.
[01:50:28.678 --> 01:50:30.558]  I'm bad, but he's the victim.
[01:50:31.039 --> 01:50:35.579]  The guy who joked about a child raping somebody, he's the victim.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.920]  He got mean tweets because of it.
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:39.300]  Well, boo-hoo!
[01:50:40.681 --> 01:50:52.263]  Again, this is Business Insider, a news outlet that was exposed in the WikiLeaks as being a mouthpiece for Hillary Clinton, and they're lecturing me about fake news.
[01:50:52.303 --> 01:50:56.404]  We'll be back after the break to talk more about it on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:50:56.464 --> 01:50:57.024]  Don't go away.
[01:51:02.984 --> 01:51:07.410]  This has been adopted as of 2017 by the Department of Defense.
[01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:09.392]  All four branches of the military.
[01:51:10.093 --> 01:51:10.954]  Combat One.
[01:51:11.995 --> 01:51:19.825]  And guess who in the spring of 2017 has the exclusive right to sell this to everybody else?
[01:51:20.987 --> 01:51:22.148]  But the military.
[01:51:23.048 --> 01:51:24.549]  Infowars.com.
[01:51:25.209 --> 01:51:28.791]  I want to commend Q and Patrick and the rest of our team.
[01:51:28.831 --> 01:51:32.072]  I want to commend Combat One for getting the big Pentagon deal.
[01:51:32.693 --> 01:51:35.454]  And I want to thank them for supporting us because they know we support America.
[01:51:35.774 --> 01:51:49.301]  We are the exclusive source of Combat One Skin and Muscle Optimization Field Foam, Field Spray Skin and Muscle Optimization, and Broad Spectrum Hygiene Tactical Bath.
[01:51:49.841 --> 01:51:51.662]  Contains eight pre-moistened cloths.
[01:51:52.323 --> 01:52:02.109]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are incredibly affordable, and they have patented proprietary systems that annihilate germs, you name it, across the board.
[01:52:02.429 --> 01:52:07.492]  That's why it's been adopted by the Pentagon, by the Defense Department, system-wide.
[01:52:07.552 --> 01:52:14.417]  I'm gonna go over some of the numbers, some of the proven statistics, and the claims that Combat One can make right now.
[01:52:15.257 --> 01:52:24.321]  Never before has the public been able to access this new Combat One military-grade hygiene technology used by special operations to maintain hygiene during survival situations.
[01:52:24.681 --> 01:52:26.762]  Studied for safety and effectiveness by St.
[01:52:26.822 --> 01:52:28.883]  John's Medical Research Institute, St.
[01:52:28.943 --> 01:52:36.687]  Jude's, and the American Journal of Infection Control, the technology behind Combat One wipes kills bad bacteria while leaving beneficial
[01:52:37.407 --> 01:52:38.888]  Skin bacteria unharmed.
[01:52:38.988 --> 01:52:40.009]  That's the key buffer.
[01:52:40.289 --> 01:52:44.993]  The toxic wipes, the sanitizers kill everything, including your immune system.
[01:52:45.033 --> 01:52:45.973]  They lower your fertility.
[01:52:45.993 --> 01:52:46.514]  It's all admitted.
[01:52:47.114 --> 01:52:50.436]  Combat One is able to do this naturally by only targeting the bad stuff.
[01:52:50.877 --> 01:52:51.777]  And again, it's all patented.
[01:52:51.797 --> 01:52:52.538]  It's super secret.
[01:52:53.198 --> 01:52:54.880]  12 years, special forces testing it.
[01:52:55.460 --> 01:53:00.844]  This is something every info warrior needs to order, needs to have in their home, needs to use in their daily lives.
[01:53:01.164 --> 01:53:04.747]  Whether it's cleaning your guns or your own skin, or when you're out camping,
[01:53:05.387 --> 01:53:06.568]  This is the game changer.
[01:53:06.588 --> 01:53:11.693]  The entire family of Combat One is available exclusively at m4warstore.com.
[01:53:12.697 --> 01:53:16.038]  Just coming back from the river where I was using one of our water filtration straws.
[01:53:16.658 --> 01:53:18.959]  A certain device we sell here at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:53:19.679 --> 01:53:24.081]  And I had to smack my knuckle pretty hard the other day with my knife after cleaning one of the animals.
[01:53:24.101 --> 01:53:30.963]  So I'm going to use some Combat One foam to show you guys that we actually use it, how well it works.
[01:53:31.043 --> 01:53:33.184]  This wound's been open for about five days now.
[01:53:33.945 --> 01:53:35.485]  I just dipped it in and out of the river.
[01:53:35.825 --> 01:53:37.866]  So just to better safe than sorry.
[01:53:47.327 --> 01:53:50.710]  Once I let that soak in, I'll wrap it up, feel dressed nice and clean again.
[01:53:51.490 --> 01:53:54.352]  And it certainly is coming to the rescue with Combat One.
[01:53:54.633 --> 01:53:55.814]  Born in America.
[01:53:56.194 --> 01:53:57.135]  Made in America.
[01:53:57.395 --> 01:54:00.597]  And now distributed by InfoWars to America.
[01:54:00.637 --> 01:54:06.061]  Get up, stand up.
[01:54:06.442 --> 01:54:11.285]  Stand up for your right.
[01:54:22.162 --> 01:54:37.986]  So a left-wing comedian, Steven Spinola, jokes about a 10-year-old boy being a future rapist, jokes about him raping his mother, jokes about a brain-damaged woman who died 12 years ago.
[01:54:38.973 --> 01:54:43.395]  But I'm the bad guy because I used the word writer rather than contributor.
[01:54:43.635 --> 01:54:45.856]  That's what they're actually saying in this article.
[01:54:46.316 --> 01:54:56.001]  Again, it's the fake news media lecturing us about journalistic integrity when they come up with the most flagrant, damaging lies on a regular basis.
[01:54:56.980 --> 01:54:58.602]  I read out the tweets before the break.
[01:54:58.662 --> 01:55:00.724]  Again, this is what he got in hot water for.
[01:55:01.285 --> 01:55:04.668]  And yes, I support his right to tell these jokes.
[01:55:04.769 --> 01:55:06.150]  I don't want to see him censored.
[01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:09.974]  If somebody wants to hire him, that's completely their decision.
[01:55:10.355 --> 01:55:16.581]  But, Newsflash, if you say controversial, shocking things on the internet, you get blowback.
[01:55:17.574 --> 01:55:24.038]  So again, this comedian, Spinola, was out within hours whining about violent threats towards him on Twitter.
[01:55:24.278 --> 01:55:25.959]  Well, join the club, Steven!
[01:55:26.259 --> 01:55:28.060]  It's called being a public figure.
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:33.663]  You probably didn't know about that before, because you probably had, like, a pathetic amount of Twitter followers.
[01:55:34.023 --> 01:55:43.149]  But if you say contentious things on the internet, you will get idiot extremists on both the left and the right sending you violent threats.
[01:55:43.962 --> 01:55:45.645]  I post them every single day.
[01:55:45.766 --> 01:55:47.830]  I get them myself every single day.
[01:55:48.230 --> 01:55:54.823]  But again, there's always this narrative, and it arose out of Gamergate originally, that the only people who get death threats are left-wingers.
[01:55:55.064 --> 01:55:55.465]  Well, no.
[01:55:56.548 --> 01:56:03.171]  Actually, the right denounces its fringe violent extremists, the left doesn't.
[01:56:03.571 --> 01:56:04.591]  That's the problem.
[01:56:05.131 --> 01:56:07.212]  That's why we had all these riots over the weekend.
[01:56:07.492 --> 01:56:09.773]  That's why people are being spat on, punched.
[01:56:10.133 --> 01:56:12.154]  That's why people's hair is being set on fire.
[01:56:12.454 --> 01:56:16.796]  Because you don't denounce your left-wing violent fringe extremists.
[01:56:17.256 --> 01:56:18.257]  You legitimise it.
[01:56:19.397 --> 01:56:23.259]  So basically this comedian was out whining within hours that he was getting all these threats.
[01:56:24.175 --> 01:56:27.306]  Business Insider comes out with this article blaming me.
[01:56:28.186 --> 01:56:43.017]  For 100,000 people signing a petition, even though I wrote about the tweets three days after he made them, after other news outlets had already picked up on the story, after these tweets had circulated on forums, but no.
[01:56:43.517 --> 01:56:49.721]  I'm bad because I used the word writer rather than contributor when I wrote this headline.
[01:56:49.881 --> 01:56:50.302]  I'm bad.
[01:56:50.602 --> 01:56:51.322]  I'm the bad guy.
[01:56:51.883 --> 01:56:57.086]  The guy who talked about a 10-year-old boy being a future rapist, he's the victim.
[01:56:57.978 --> 01:56:58.358]  Okay.
[01:56:58.919 --> 01:56:59.239]  Great.
[01:56:59.839 --> 01:57:11.167]  And this guy, this Oliver Darcy, actually contacted me on Twitter afterwards, after I called him out, because they think they can just attack you publicly, and you're just gonna lie back and take it, and not say anything about it.
[01:57:11.367 --> 01:57:11.907]  Well, I do.
[01:57:13.028 --> 01:57:20.012]  And when you actually confront people on Twitter, they just panic and freak out, because people are disagreeing with them, and they're getting some hate.
[01:57:20.493 --> 01:57:21.453]  Yeah, join the club!
[01:57:21.493 --> 01:57:23.054]  It's called being a public figure.
[01:57:23.675 --> 01:57:25.256]  So he contacts me on Twitter,
[01:57:26.101 --> 01:57:28.563]  And he's like, oh, I don't want to engage with you on Twitter.
[01:57:29.004 --> 01:57:30.665]  I'm not a leftist, blah, blah, blah.
[01:57:30.705 --> 01:57:35.209]  And it's like, if you don't want to engage with me on Twitter, don't tweet at me.
[01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:40.434]  Don't write stories about my headlines where, God forbid, I get a word wrong.
[01:57:41.889 --> 01:57:42.870]  This was his tweet.
[01:57:43.730 --> 01:57:44.751]  The truth matters.
[01:57:45.151 --> 01:57:45.951]  Facts matter.
[01:57:46.211 --> 01:57:48.813]  Maybe not to you, but these things do matter.
[01:57:49.413 --> 01:57:49.793]  Really.
[01:57:50.234 --> 01:57:57.978]  They didn't seem to matter too much when your own business insider journalists were whoring themselves out for Hillary Clinton, did they?
[01:57:58.638 --> 01:58:00.460]  And I posted the articles up there today.
[01:58:01.499 --> 01:58:01.979]  Here's one.
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:07.224]  WikiLeaks former Business Insider writer Colin Campbell acted as a Clinton propagandist.
[01:58:07.685 --> 01:58:19.716]  So you've got this Business Insider editor lecturing me about journalistic integrity when one of his own writers and others were exposed in the WikiLeaks emails as being actual
[01:58:20.356 --> 01:58:23.597]  Mouthpiece prestitutes for Hillary Clinton.
[01:58:23.837 --> 01:58:28.017]  Yet they have the nerve to lecture me about fake news.
[01:58:28.458 --> 01:58:34.119]  And when you confront them about it on Twitter, they completely freak out and say, oh, I don't want to have a discussion with you.
[01:58:34.439 --> 01:58:37.939]  But we're going to have that discussion, and you're going to be exposed.
[01:58:37.999 --> 01:58:39.580]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:40.640]  Don't go away.
[01:58:44.361 --> 01:58:46.101]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:47.987 --> 01:58:53.268]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:53.908 --> 01:59:01.010]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:59:01.390 --> 01:59:14.593]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[01:59:27.428 --> 01:59:33.395]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[02:00:14.759 --> 02:00:19.432]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.438 --> 02:00:29.839]  Third and final hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:29.879 --> 02:00:34.001]  Actually, we've got the fourth hour coming up later, but for the moment, we're going to stick with this issue.
[02:00:35.002 --> 02:00:41.585]  So basically, the left is now whining about this outrage culture that they created and they perfected.
[02:00:41.865 --> 02:00:49.369]  And whenever any of them get any heat whatsoever for their stupid tweets, they play the victim card.
[02:00:49.849 --> 02:00:52.110]  Oh, look, people are saying mean things about me.
[02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:53.991]  People are violently threatening me.
[02:00:54.031 --> 02:00:55.392]  Yeah, join the club.
[02:00:56.312 --> 02:00:58.214]  How is this still a thing anymore?
[02:00:58.734 --> 02:01:01.097]  Yeah, even today we have it in the BBC.
[02:01:01.637 --> 02:01:11.786]  This is an article where the woman who brought the court case which has delayed Brexit, Gina Miller, the headline is, Man held over threats in Gina Miller Brexit case, BBC News.
[02:01:12.347 --> 02:01:17.031]  The man has been arrested over alleged threats made against Gina Miller, the woman behind the Brexit legal challenge.
[02:01:17.652 --> 02:01:21.455]  So it talks about people who have been arrested because they threatened her on Twitter.
[02:01:22.217 --> 02:01:26.251]  Others have been told to stop tweeting basically because they made violent threats.
[02:01:26.312 --> 02:01:26.593]  Yes!
[02:01:27.975 --> 02:01:32.877]  Anyone who is even vaguely a public figure gets violent threats.
[02:01:32.897 --> 02:01:42.120]  I mean, after I made a video about the riots in Milwaukee, literally overnight there were 50 death threats from Black Lives Matter activists.
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:44.861]  But CNN says it's peaceful, so I guess you should believe them.
[02:01:45.541 --> 02:01:47.302]  Everybody gets death threats.
[02:01:47.522 --> 02:01:48.862]  Everybody gets violent threats.
[02:01:49.423 --> 02:01:54.004]  I just looked in my inbox and there were another dozen just over the past few hours.
[02:01:54.364 --> 02:01:55.925]  People wishing death upon me.
[02:01:56.991 --> 02:01:57.952]  Yeah, big deal.
[02:01:58.272 --> 02:02:09.182]  Put your big boy pants on and grow up and just accept that that's a form, that's a consequence of saying contentious things on the internet, whether they're jokes or whether they're political opinions.
[02:02:09.542 --> 02:02:13.546]  And yes, you have the right to make nasty, obscene, offensive jokes.
[02:02:13.606 --> 02:02:15.368]  I'm not going to call for you to be censored.
[02:02:15.728 --> 02:02:17.410]  I'm not going to call for you to be fired.
[02:02:18.575 --> 02:02:26.181]  But it's just kind of ironic how now I'm being blamed for outrage culture which the left created and perfected in the first place.
[02:02:26.641 --> 02:02:34.067]  And then they get to pretend like they've got the moral high ground because I used the word writer instead of contributor.
[02:02:35.007 --> 02:02:40.632]  When they're literally defending a guy who's making jokes about a ten-year-old kid being a rapist.
[02:02:41.152 --> 02:02:43.013]  But I'm the bad guy, he's the victim.
[02:02:43.113 --> 02:02:43.994]  Okay, let's move on.
[02:02:44.494 --> 02:02:45.915]  The Daily Mail reports
[02:02:46.735 --> 02:02:47.637]  But is it art?
[02:02:48.238 --> 02:02:55.113]  Angry man Shia LaBeouf rants at camera as he partakes in his anti-Donald Trump project in New York City.
[02:02:56.021 --> 02:02:58.023]  Now we could be kind about Shia LaBeouf.
[02:02:58.083 --> 02:03:05.188]  I could say that he's had some interesting art projects in the past which deal with the ludicrousness of celebrity.
[02:03:05.829 --> 02:03:18.338]  Or we could be not so nice about him and say he's a narcissistic has-been attention whore who made one decent movie ten years ago and now seems to be preoccupied with having drunken meltdowns and being arrested.
[02:03:19.299 --> 02:03:26.804]  And trying to look like Che Guevara, trying to look authentic by dressing like a homeless person when he's actually a multi-millionaire.
[02:03:26.864 --> 02:03:29.446]  We could be not so nice and say those things about him.
[02:03:30.467 --> 02:03:40.814]  But this latest art project is really interesting because it's basically turned into a homing beacon for cult members, for anti-Trump hysterical cult members.
[02:03:41.435 --> 02:03:42.595]  It's basically a camera
[02:03:43.496 --> 02:03:48.577]  And a microphone in New York City with the words, he will not divide us above it.
[02:03:49.197 --> 02:03:54.159]  And it's a live stream and people are invited to go there and share their opinions.
[02:03:55.319 --> 02:04:02.501]  Meanwhile, you have basically cult members chanting over and over again, he will not divide us, he will not divide us.
[02:04:03.121 --> 02:04:11.763]  It sounds like a reinvention of the older Occupy Wall Street mic check thing, which even people on the left thought was very creepy and cult-like.
[02:04:12.603 --> 02:04:15.787]  And now it's happening again with this Shia LaBeouf project.
[02:04:16.087 --> 02:04:20.452]  So as you see in the video here, he's basically been trolled by Neo-Nazis.
[02:04:21.053 --> 02:04:23.695]  You hear him shouting, screaming in this guy's face.
[02:04:24.276 --> 02:04:27.960]  Now yes, this guy is a Neo-Nazi.
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:29.282]  He's a bad guy.
[02:04:29.542 --> 02:04:31.424]  I don't agree with Neo-Nazis.
[02:04:31.504 --> 02:04:32.906]  I don't support their opinions.
[02:04:33.905 --> 02:04:36.487]  But look at the behavior of Shia LaBeouf.
[02:04:36.607 --> 02:04:50.998]  This is a guy who wants everybody to be united and for division not to be happening and he's the guy angrily shouting in this individual's face while of course he's protected by like three massive security guards.
[02:04:51.038 --> 02:04:52.979]  He's fronting up to a five-foot weakling.
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:55.741]  We'll be back to talk about it on the Alex Jones Show live.
[02:04:56.102 --> 02:04:57.323]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[02:04:57.343 --> 02:04:58.644]  Don't go away.
[02:05:03.422 --> 02:05:15.445]  ABC has the first one-on-one interview with President Trump, and they are taking ownership of what should be public information, listing unprecedented restrictions on the publishing of that information.
[02:05:15.645 --> 02:05:21.227]  They're mandating on-screen credits, mandating that any excerpts must be introduced with an audio credit.
[02:05:21.527 --> 02:05:24.007]  They put limits on how long the excerpts can be.
[02:05:24.147 --> 02:05:26.948]  They put a time limit on how long material can be used.
[02:05:27.048 --> 02:05:29.509]  No material may be used after February the 1st.
[02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:35.653]  This is a desperate bid by ABC to circumvent freedom of the press and fair use.
[02:05:35.994 --> 02:05:45.981]  They're trying to take control of Trump's message, trying to monopolize it, both to monetize it and to spin it as they wish for political purposes, even banning future use of it.
[02:05:46.362 --> 02:05:51.966]  Extraordinary copyright claims and enforcement were a major problem with the TPP that Trump just shut down.
[02:05:52.126 --> 02:05:57.971]  And he should shut down this desperate attempt by ABC to try to copyright what the president says in interviews.
[02:05:58.372 --> 02:06:00.282]  That is not appropriate.
[02:06:00.362 --> 02:06:02.393]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:06:03.797 --> 02:06:05.199]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:06:05.239 --> 02:06:06.299]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:06:06.560 --> 02:06:07.480]  Why is this so good?
[02:06:07.781 --> 02:06:13.025]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:06:13.105 --> 02:06:26.655]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:06:26.715 --> 02:06:28.097]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:06:28.997 --> 02:06:30.439]  Spreading disease around.
[02:06:30.519 --> 02:06:33.002]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:06:33.102 --> 02:06:34.364]  These are all parasites.
[02:06:34.404 --> 02:06:35.505]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:06:35.525 --> 02:06:36.566]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:06:36.867 --> 02:06:41.212]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:06:41.392 --> 02:06:44.596]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:06:44.636 --> 02:06:47.717]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:06:47.757 --> 02:06:48.757]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:06:48.817 --> 02:06:50.698]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:50.758 --> 02:06:51.778]  And folks, you can't lose.

[02:08:13.562 --> 02:08:19.266]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:19.747 --> 02:08:33.656]  So, let's talk about Shia LaBeouf and his new art project, which, you know, he's basically a narcissistic attention whore at this point, so the modern art world will love him.
[02:08:34.397 --> 02:08:40.882]  He's got a camera up there, he's got a microphone, people chanting, he will not divide us, he will not divide us, like cult members.
[02:08:41.909 --> 02:08:45.931]  He's being very aggressive to anyone who tries to troll that.
[02:08:45.971 --> 02:08:48.093]  He's getting in their face, screaming at them.
[02:08:48.393 --> 02:08:50.834]  Of course, they're five-foot weaklings.
[02:08:50.874 --> 02:08:52.615]  He's got three security guards behind him.
[02:08:52.635 --> 02:08:53.256]  He's very tough.
[02:08:54.236 --> 02:08:55.937]  And yes, they're neo-Nazis.
[02:08:55.997 --> 02:09:04.663]  And we don't agree with neo-Nazis, but we also don't agree with getting violent towards people with whom we disagree politically.
[02:09:04.703 --> 02:09:08.365]  And that's the point here, which is why we're going to talk about Richard Spencer.
[02:09:08.925 --> 02:09:34.074]  Now Richard Spencer is somebody who, you know I had Mike Cernovich on here a few months ago now and we did a whole hour almost talking about Richard Spencer, talking about how we disavow InfoWars, how Cernovich disavows himself from Richard Spencer, from his audience because they got up right after Trump won the election, they invited the mainstream media vipers into the den
[02:09:34.574 --> 02:09:42.181]  They had a little conference with Neo-Nazis and they all got up and did the Sieg Heil while Richard Spencer was saying Heil Trump.
[02:09:42.762 --> 02:09:44.404]  Now you can call this guy whatever you like.
[02:09:44.424 --> 02:09:48.307]  You can call him a Neo-Nazi, white supremacist, an identitarian.
[02:09:49.110 --> 02:09:50.672]  Yes, I don't agree with him.
[02:09:51.012 --> 02:09:53.775]  I've had arguments and blazing rows with him.
[02:09:54.376 --> 02:09:56.459]  This is not somebody who I support.
[02:09:56.879 --> 02:10:00.944]  But it's also not somebody who I'm going to violently attack.
[02:10:01.244 --> 02:10:07.451]  Because newsflash, you can't violently attack people on the street just because you disagree with them politically.
[02:10:08.257 --> 02:10:27.052]  And what we've seen, and you can roll the video of Richard Spencer being punched at the inauguration riots, what we've seen is the legitimisation of anti-Trump hysteria by the mainstream media, the legitimisation of violence against people just because you disagree with them politically.
[02:10:27.332 --> 02:10:30.955]  Again, it doesn't matter if he's a neo-Nazi.
[02:10:31.196 --> 02:10:33.497]  It doesn't matter if you think he's a neo-Nazi.
[02:10:34.258 --> 02:10:35.861]  Here's another newsflash, okay?
[02:10:36.041 --> 02:10:41.909]  The far left thinks everyone and anyone who disagrees with them is a neo-Nazi.
[02:10:42.831 --> 02:10:48.099]  So you're giving them carte blanche to go and punch anyone they like on the street.
[02:10:49.335 --> 02:10:51.156]  Of course they don't like it the other way round.
[02:10:51.216 --> 02:10:55.778]  We saw Gavin McInnes get in a fight with an Antifa fascist.
[02:10:55.878 --> 02:10:57.018]  They're the actual fascists.
[02:10:57.098 --> 02:10:57.958]  They attack people.
[02:10:57.998 --> 02:10:59.179]  They smash up property.
[02:10:59.439 --> 02:11:03.481]  They intimidate people out of expressing their opinions, like the Nazis did.
[02:11:03.861 --> 02:11:05.041]  They're the actual fascists.
[02:11:05.922 --> 02:11:08.123]  But you saw Gavin McInnes get in a fight with one of them.
[02:11:08.523 --> 02:11:16.466]  You saw another guy who tried to run through a roadblock that was set up by these Antifa little commie fascists.
[02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:19.351]  Here you see the Gavin McInnes fight.
[02:11:19.391 --> 02:11:21.791]  He gets in a fist fight almost with this individual.
[02:11:22.172 --> 02:11:25.113]  And many people said, to be fair, that Gavin was the aggressor.
[02:11:25.753 --> 02:11:33.496]  You have another video, which I think you've got, which is a guy at a checkpoint again at the anti-Trump hysterical frothing temper tantrum.
[02:11:33.876 --> 02:11:35.616]  There's a group of Antifa activists.
[02:11:36.077 --> 02:11:39.818]  He tries to barrel through them because they're stopping him from going where he wants to go.
[02:11:39.838 --> 02:11:41.078]  Here you see the clip.
[02:11:41.619 --> 02:11:42.199]  And this guy
[02:11:43.373 --> 02:11:44.914]  You see him there, he starts to attack them.
[02:11:45.415 --> 02:11:51.320]  Just before that and just after it, there you see he starts to try and punch one of them, and in fact does punch one of them.
[02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:59.006]  So if you're making the argument that it's acceptable to violently attack people because you disagree with them politically,
[02:11:59.767 --> 02:12:02.169]  Then you can have no complaints about that, okay?
[02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:19.483]  But what we've seen with this Richard Spencer incident over the last few days is not just the far left, but the mainstream media getting on board creating this narrative that it's okay to meter out violence in advance of a political objective.
[02:12:20.043 --> 02:12:23.166]  Now, you look up the word terrorism
[02:12:23.846 --> 02:12:25.787]  What's the definition of the word terrorism?
[02:12:26.008 --> 02:12:32.852]  Well, it's the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.
[02:12:32.932 --> 02:12:34.333]  And doesn't that sound familiar?
[02:12:35.034 --> 02:12:46.641]  We have the mainstream media actually legitimizing terrorism with these violent attacks against so-called alt-righters and anyone who they disagree with.
[02:12:47.022 --> 02:12:49.743]  Again, doesn't matter if he's a Nazi, okay?
[02:12:50.064 --> 02:12:51.625]  I've had arguments with him on Twitter.
[02:12:51.725 --> 02:12:52.505]  I don't support him.
[02:12:52.865 --> 02:12:53.466]  Doesn't matter.
[02:12:54.728 --> 02:13:00.643]  Do I have the right to go around punching communists in the face on the street because I'm offended by them?
[02:13:01.368 --> 02:13:09.990]  No, yet they advocate a belief system that was responsible for the deaths of tens of millions more people than fascism.
[02:13:10.651 --> 02:13:14.492]  Even if this guy's a fascist, he says he's not a neo-Nazi, even if you think he is.
[02:13:15.092 --> 02:13:20.353]  Does that make it okay for me to violently attack communists because they have hammer and sickles?
[02:13:20.753 --> 02:13:23.234]  Because they have Mao posters up on their walls?
[02:13:23.554 --> 02:13:25.535]  Which the culture has made trendy, yeah.
[02:13:26.482 --> 02:13:29.783]  What was it, 200 million people dead because of communism alone?
[02:13:30.163 --> 02:13:32.023]  That's trendy, that's acceptable.
[02:13:33.084 --> 02:13:38.085]  But, God forbid, you support Donald Trump, you're a Nazi, and we're going to punch you in the face.
[02:13:38.545 --> 02:13:39.625]  Listen to this article.
[02:13:39.986 --> 02:13:41.146]  This is out of the nation.
[02:13:41.646 --> 02:13:44.027]  Okay, this is not Antifa, this is out of the nation.
[02:13:45.227 --> 02:13:48.868]  Neo-Nazi Richard Spencer got punched, you can thank the Black Bloc.
[02:13:49.929 --> 02:14:02.115]  And it's by this writer, Natasha Lenard, who says that the punch lends itself perfectly to a beat and goes on to basically romanticise the fact that he was punched in the face.
[02:14:02.735 --> 02:14:08.958]  Again, advocating violence in pursuit of a political goal, that is terrorism.
[02:14:09.318 --> 02:14:14.721]  It doesn't matter if he's a Nazi or if you think he's a Nazi, OK?
[02:14:16.035 --> 02:14:17.476]  You're on the same page.
[02:14:17.996 --> 02:14:36.343]  All of you leftists who are out there advocating violence to shut down free speech, you are on the same page as the Charlie Hebdo jihadists who went into that cartoon newsroom, massacred those people in Paris because they were offended by their political opinion.
[02:14:37.004 --> 02:14:38.524]  You're on the same page as them.
[02:14:38.784 --> 02:14:40.745]  That's great company to keep, isn't it?
[02:14:41.746 --> 02:14:44.047]  Yet this narrative will not end.
[02:14:45.134 --> 02:14:50.658]  They think it's legitimate to violently attack someone because he's a Nazi.
[02:14:51.238 --> 02:14:54.340]  Again, the far left thinks everyone's a Nazi.
[02:14:54.700 --> 02:14:56.001]  Where is this gonna lead?
[02:14:57.442 --> 02:15:04.286]  The free speech that you have is dependent on your worst enemies having those free speech rights, okay?
[02:15:04.567 --> 02:15:08.149]  If neo-Nazis don't have their free speech, you don't have yours.
[02:15:08.349 --> 02:15:09.270]  That's how it works.
[02:15:09.330 --> 02:15:10.911]  It's all or nothing.
[02:15:11.671 --> 02:15:12.672]  That's how it works.
[02:15:13.854 --> 02:15:16.715]  And so is Richard Spencer literally Adolf Hitler?
[02:15:17.215 --> 02:15:22.716]  Is he leading a panzer division of invasion tanks that are going to mow people down?
[02:15:22.916 --> 02:15:23.137]  No.
[02:15:23.557 --> 02:15:28.018]  Yes, if you're in an actual war with Nazis, then you can kill Nazis.
[02:15:28.438 --> 02:15:32.219]  Last time I checked, we weren't in World War II, okay?
[02:15:33.359 --> 02:15:37.560]  You can't attack people because they disagree with you politically.
[02:15:37.820 --> 02:15:43.082]  You set the precedence for absolute carnage and civil war, you idiots!
[02:15:44.189 --> 02:15:46.591]  But I keep hearing this on Twitter every single day.
[02:15:47.091 --> 02:15:49.473]  And it's mainly from the people who support Antifa.
[02:15:50.333 --> 02:15:55.157]  You know, the so-called anti-fascists who behave like actual fascists.
[02:15:55.697 --> 02:16:00.961]  You know, the mum's basement-dwelling thugs, most of whom never worked a day in their life.
[02:16:01.902 --> 02:16:05.885]  They're what happens when teen brats are never told no by their parents.
[02:16:06.305 --> 02:16:07.726]  They're the actual fascists.
[02:16:08.126 --> 02:16:09.567]  They're the actual brownshirts.
[02:16:09.968 --> 02:16:12.950]  They're the people who plan acid attacks
[02:16:13.917 --> 02:16:16.380]  On Trump supporters at the deplorable.
[02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:24.588]  They're the people who plan neck punches on people attending the deplorable, as was exposed by James O'Keefe.
[02:16:25.369 --> 02:16:29.132]  They're the people who like to get in people's faces and assault them.
[02:16:29.893 --> 02:16:35.815]  We saw them assault the other Trump supporter the night before Trump was inaugurated.
[02:16:36.135 --> 02:16:43.198]  Snatched his hat off him when he tried to retrieve the hat, punched in the face, whacked with a flagpole.
[02:16:43.678 --> 02:16:45.099]  That's the tolerant left for you.
[02:16:45.979 --> 02:16:52.022]  And again, they say, oh, violence against fascism is justified, otherwise we're enabling it.
[02:16:52.482 --> 02:16:55.043]  Absolute bonkum BS.
[02:16:56.477 --> 02:16:58.960]  I can't go around punching communists in the face.
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:16:59.861]  I wouldn't want to.
[02:17:00.121 --> 02:17:07.869]  Because I still, even though everything they stand for is absolutely vile, I still support their right to free speech.
[02:17:09.195 --> 02:17:15.641]  The same free speech that protects my free speech is if it doesn't apply to them, it doesn't apply to anyone.
[02:17:16.481 --> 02:17:19.224]  So again, you've got these Antifa scumbags defending it.
[02:17:19.544 --> 02:17:31.014]  They like to get in people's faces, they like to assault people, yet they cower in fear whenever you stick a camera in their face because they don't like to be identified, which is why they wear the black masks.
[02:17:31.635 --> 02:17:32.455]  Now, it's interesting.
[02:17:33.496 --> 02:17:43.925]  In regard to this Spencer incident, where Richard Spencer was punched in the face, this guy probably doesn't want to be identified, because it actually emerged in the aftermath.
[02:17:44.386 --> 02:17:50.711]  And if you've got children listening, just turn the volume down right now, because this is disgusting, but it has to be said.
[02:17:51.171 --> 02:17:54.814]  It emerged in the aftermath that this guy who punched Richard Spencer
[02:17:55.555 --> 02:18:05.378]  was literally a cuckold sex slave who likes to be led around on a chain and, wait for it, likes to pay women to poop on him.
[02:18:06.278 --> 02:18:13.400]  Yeah, they actually uncovered the identity of this tough guy who cold-clocked Richard Spencer in the face from the side.
[02:18:15.165 --> 02:18:16.887]  That's what he does in his spare time.
[02:18:17.027 --> 02:18:20.170]  That's your moral high ground right there, Antifa.
[02:18:20.531 --> 02:18:27.257]  A guy who's literally a cuckold is led around on a chain like a dog and pays women to poop on him.
[02:18:27.958 --> 02:18:29.360]  Now, I'm sorry to have to say that.
[02:18:29.420 --> 02:18:30.821]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[02:18:31.262 --> 02:18:32.182]  But that's the truth.
[02:18:33.284 --> 02:18:35.146]  That's what these Antifa guys are into.
[02:18:36.274 --> 02:18:44.578]  You know, this is an organisation that gets infiltrated by the cops at every single major protest because they're incredibly stupid and naive.
[02:18:44.978 --> 02:18:54.483]  This is the organisation whose stupid, violent, aggressive behaviour, you know, they went to war with trash cans again, like what have trash cans done to offend them?
[02:18:55.044 --> 02:19:00.847]  It's their behaviour that leads to the cops attacking and pepper spraying innocent people.
[02:19:01.507 --> 02:19:04.749]  You had all these journalists who were arrested during the inauguration
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:08.462]  Because they were merely in the same vicinity as these idiots.
[02:19:08.522 --> 02:19:11.485]  There you see them bravely taking on the trash cans.
[02:19:13.247 --> 02:19:16.930]  So you have their behaviour responsible for the cops overreacting.
[02:19:17.350 --> 02:19:19.252]  That's why the cops used to infiltrate them.
[02:19:19.292 --> 02:19:27.379]  They probably still do, because they could use them as the excuse to have an overreaction and to shut down all the legitimate protests.
[02:19:27.879 --> 02:19:33.084]  I mean, Alex Jones exposed that way back in 99 with the WTO in Seattle.
[02:19:33.504 --> 02:19:38.826]  Completely infiltrated by the police, because it's a problem-reaction-solution scenario.
[02:19:39.206 --> 02:19:55.490]  If they can infiltrate them, they can divert them, they can include legitimate protesters in this same group of people, they can kettle them in, pepper spray them, arrest them, and it's innocent people who suffer because of the aggressive, barbarous actions of Antifa.
[02:19:55.850 --> 02:19:57.231]  They are scum!
[02:19:57.611 --> 02:20:00.772]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live, Infowars.com, don't go away.
[02:20:07.142 --> 02:20:16.689]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[02:20:17.730 --> 02:20:19.531]  And so I get questions all the time over the years.
[02:20:20.312 --> 02:20:26.036]  Why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsStore.com or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[02:20:26.756 --> 02:20:27.396]  And it's simple.
[02:20:27.977 --> 02:20:33.079]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[02:20:33.540 --> 02:20:34.540]  And there's a nexus point.
[02:20:34.620 --> 02:20:37.402]  There's quality versus price.
[02:20:37.442 --> 02:20:39.363]  And those two points have to come together.
[02:20:39.963 --> 02:20:52.930]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor, has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[02:20:54.304 --> 02:20:56.386]  The true next generation in body armor.
[02:20:57.266 --> 02:21:04.251]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[02:21:05.052 --> 02:21:07.834]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[02:21:07.854 --> 02:21:10.276]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[02:21:10.316 --> 02:21:14.319]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[02:21:14.759 --> 02:21:15.559]  Well, believe me,
[02:21:16.660 --> 02:21:19.322]  This is disruptive to tyrants worldwide.
[02:21:19.902 --> 02:21:30.328]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[02:21:30.988 --> 02:21:32.589]  It's nanotube technology.
[02:21:33.190 --> 02:21:34.730]  It's created here in Texas.
[02:21:35.351 --> 02:21:42.415]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[02:21:43.155 --> 02:21:45.536]  We've went out and did some testing.
[02:21:45.956 --> 02:21:48.296]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[02:21:48.316 --> 02:21:54.778]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible could be so strong.
[02:21:55.018 --> 02:22:08.301]  So what we did is we went out, we used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[02:22:08.681 --> 02:22:09.502]  Born in Texas.
[02:22:09.842 --> 02:22:10.762]  Made in America.
[02:22:11.003 --> 02:22:13.644]  Exclusively available at Infowarsstore.com right now.
[02:22:13.724 --> 02:22:14.505]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:22:14.565 --> 02:22:15.505]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[02:22:15.866 --> 02:22:17.186]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[02:22:17.247 --> 02:22:17.867]  It's waterproof.
[02:22:17.907 --> 02:22:18.347]  You can wear it.
[02:22:18.367 --> 02:22:18.968]  It's comfortable.
[02:22:19.028 --> 02:22:19.808]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[02:22:19.848 --> 02:22:22.150]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[02:22:22.630 --> 02:22:30.235]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[02:22:30.935 --> 02:22:34.597]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[02:22:34.617 --> 02:22:41.442]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[02:22:41.462 --> 02:22:42.662]  What did they really say about this?
[02:22:42.702 --> 02:22:43.823]  No, this is through the roof.
[02:22:44.003 --> 02:22:46.745]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[02:22:47.585 --> 02:22:51.368]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[02:22:51.488 --> 02:22:55.572]  Because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[02:22:56.052 --> 02:23:01.056]  So they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[02:23:01.176 --> 02:23:06.620]  And 90, I mean you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in official crime, I think it's like 94.
[02:23:07.521 --> 02:23:08.582]  It's pistols or shotguns.
[02:23:08.602 --> 02:23:09.842]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[02:23:10.262 --> 02:23:11.403]  I mean, that's amazing.
[02:23:11.463 --> 02:23:14.684]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[02:23:14.924 --> 02:23:16.205]  And soon, they won't have it.
[02:23:16.545 --> 02:23:20.967]  If it's available to civilians who are not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[02:23:21.127 --> 02:23:25.188]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[02:23:25.989 --> 02:23:29.330]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[02:23:29.350 --> 02:23:30.131]  People didn't believe in it.
[02:23:30.411 --> 02:23:31.451]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[02:23:31.511 --> 02:23:33.132]  I feed my horse hay.
[02:23:34.554 --> 02:23:36.655]  The Backpack Body Armor is only $200.
[02:23:37.135 --> 02:23:41.756]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[02:23:43.016 --> 02:23:44.897]  Again, fund the InfoWard.
[02:23:45.037 --> 02:23:48.978]  Get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[02:23:49.458 --> 02:23:51.499]  It's a win-win.
[02:23:51.819 --> 02:23:51.499]  $200.
[02:23:52.059 --> 02:23:55.000]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWardStore.com.
[02:23:55.100 --> 02:23:55.820]  It's amazing.
[02:24:13.604 --> 02:24:25.972]  So we have the mainstream media legitimising once again, fetishising violence in the aftermath of this assault on Richard Spencer, who again is a guy who I've argued with, don't agree with on basically anything.
[02:24:25.992 --> 02:24:32.756]  But I defend his right to free speech because if he doesn't have a right to free speech, then neither does anyone.
[02:24:33.196 --> 02:24:35.398]  When are you going to get that through your thick heads?
[02:24:36.414 --> 02:24:41.520]  So we have the Antifa anarchists, who actually act like brown-shirt fascists.
[02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:45.344]  You know, they're smashing Starbucks windows one week.
[02:24:45.804 --> 02:24:52.432]  Next week, they're in Starbucks, sipping on a chai latte, whining about capitalism and the system.
[02:24:52.732 --> 02:24:53.132]  Man!
[02:24:53.713 --> 02:24:55.074]  Complete parody of itself.
[02:24:55.635 --> 02:25:02.641]  Completely ludicrous movement that just turns up once every year to smash a few Starbucks windows.
[02:25:02.681 --> 02:25:07.124]  Never achieves anything whatsoever, apart from making themselves look incredibly stupid.
[02:25:07.144 --> 02:25:14.510]  There you see a clip from a video of a woman ranting at a Starbucks barista about left-wing issues.
[02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:16.191]  I reckon that's fake.
[02:25:16.251 --> 02:25:17.212]  I saw that last night.
[02:25:17.252 --> 02:25:18.693]  It looks like a really good troll.
[02:25:19.474 --> 02:25:21.335]  But maybe we'll play that at some other point.
[02:25:21.996 --> 02:25:22.676]  So you've got the
[02:25:24.164 --> 02:25:30.147]  Leftists basically advocating violence to shut down free speech, which makes them terrorists.
[02:25:30.767 --> 02:25:33.629]  That's the very definition of the word terrorist.
[02:25:33.649 --> 02:25:37.511]  They're on the same page as the Charlie Hebdo jihadists.
[02:25:38.479 --> 02:25:44.282]  Who stormed into a cartoon newsroom and massacred a bunch of people while chanting Allah Akbar.
[02:25:44.422 --> 02:25:47.304]  Oh, that's what the feminists in Germany were chanting yesterday, wasn't it?
[02:25:47.864 --> 02:25:49.205]  We're going to get to that clip in a minute.
[02:25:49.785 --> 02:25:57.969]  So we've got this environment being created that it's acceptable to violently attack people if you disagree with them politically.
[02:25:58.430 --> 02:25:58.690]  Again.
[02:26:00.148 --> 02:26:03.791]  The fact that they're a neo-Nazi doesn't matter.
[02:26:04.111 --> 02:26:05.532]  That doesn't matter.
[02:26:05.793 --> 02:26:08.395]  When are you going to get that through your thick skulls?
[02:26:08.475 --> 02:26:11.497]  If they don't have free speech, nobody has free speech.
[02:26:12.118 --> 02:26:18.303]  This idea that you can just attack people if you disagree with them, if they offend you, this is what it leads to.
[02:26:18.423 --> 02:26:19.304]  And this is on you.
[02:26:19.624 --> 02:26:26.550]  This is on all you leftists on Twitter, on social media, who are celebrating romanticising violence.
[02:26:27.210 --> 02:26:29.131]  Against people at the inauguration.
[02:26:29.612 --> 02:26:31.993]  This is up on Infowars.com and we can roll the video.
[02:26:32.413 --> 02:26:36.856]  Leftist thugs viciously attack woman for wearing Spanish flag.
[02:26:37.536 --> 02:26:46.722]  Video footage shows leftists in Spain viciously attacking a woman in the street because she was wearing a bracelet that displayed the country's national flag.
[02:26:47.932 --> 02:26:50.257]  Now, they've arrested six of these individuals.
[02:26:50.677 --> 02:26:59.494]  One of them is a leftist politician who is a local elections candidate for the United Left Party in Murcia, Spain.
[02:27:01.803 --> 02:27:07.167]  This is what happens when you legitimise assaulting people for their political beliefs.
[02:27:07.427 --> 02:27:08.688]  Do you get it?
[02:27:09.369 --> 02:27:24.120]  In fact, a comedian in Spain, or in fact he was an actor, came out and said that this girl, who was brutally assaulted as she lay defenceless on the floor in the middle of the night, she deserved it because she was, quote, human garbage.
[02:27:24.820 --> 02:27:26.862]  Again, the classy left strikes again.
[02:27:26.922 --> 02:27:28.303]  The tolerant left strikes again.
[02:27:30.046 --> 02:27:42.493]  All of you people who celebrated Richard Spencer being punched, the beating, the brutal assault of this young girl in Spain by these leftist thugs, that is on you.
[02:27:43.613 --> 02:27:52.378]  And you don't have the right to an opinion anymore if somebody comes up and punches you in the face, because this is the environment that you called for.
[02:27:52.818 --> 02:27:55.019]  So you're going to get it back in spades.
[02:27:55.619 --> 02:27:56.480]  Good luck with that.
[02:27:57.566 --> 02:28:08.814]  I will continue to voice my opinions and my free speech without having to resort to using my fists, because that's what we do in an actual, tolerant, liberal, civil society.
[02:28:08.994 --> 02:28:09.334]  Okay?
[02:28:09.575 --> 02:28:09.955]  Get it?
[02:28:11.216 --> 02:28:13.217]  I have to keep saying this every single day now.
[02:28:13.237 --> 02:28:15.118]  I'm going to move on from that though.
[02:28:16.158 --> 02:28:29.947]  We have got lots more news to cover, but on a similar subject, this is also up on In4Wars.com, German newspaper publisher says, or jokes, it's just a joke, murder Trump to get him out of office.
[02:28:30.007 --> 02:28:44.918]  This is the newspaper editor and publisher of, I think it's Die Zeit, a weekly German newspaper, who went on German television and joked about getting Donald Trump out of office, not through impeachment, but by somebody in the White House
[02:28:45.558 --> 02:28:46.519]  Murdering him.
[02:28:48.301 --> 02:28:51.384]  This is not some far-left Antifa radical.
[02:28:51.684 --> 02:28:55.207]  This is a major newspaper publisher there in Germany.
[02:28:56.168 --> 02:29:01.353]  Getting up on a live panel discussion show and joking about Trump's assassination.
[02:29:01.994 --> 02:29:05.137]  Now bear in mind that there is a comedian in Germany.
[02:29:06.468 --> 02:29:19.042]  Jan Bowerman, who insulted Erdogan, the Turkish dictator, and faces, what is it, five years in jail for insulting a foreign head of state, because that's the law in Germany.
[02:29:19.643 --> 02:29:26.230]  If you're nasty, if you say something mean to a foreign head of state, if you make fun of them, you face five years in jail.
[02:29:27.071 --> 02:29:36.339]  Will Joseph Joffe, the newspaper publisher who said Donald Trump should be murdered, is he going to face five years in jail?
[02:29:36.720 --> 02:29:42.625]  I very much doubt it because the left's own rules don't apply to them every single time.
[02:29:42.665 --> 02:29:46.028]  We'll be back with the Alex Jones Show live, breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[02:29:46.148 --> 02:29:47.089]  Now go away.
[02:29:52.426 --> 02:29:55.412]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.432 --> 02:29:59.039]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.321 --> 02:30:05.682]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:30:05.902 --> 02:30:10.705]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[02:30:10.825 --> 02:30:14.088]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[02:30:14.348 --> 02:30:19.731]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:30:20.172 --> 02:30:28.757]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[02:30:28.998 --> 02:30:34.101]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[02:30:34.361 --> 02:30:41.047]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[02:30:41.347 --> 02:30:45.930]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[02:30:46.071 --> 02:30:49.233]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[02:30:49.373 --> 02:30:51.275]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[02:30:51.455 --> 02:30:56.799]  Even better, use coupon code POWER at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[02:30:57.080 --> 02:30:59.061]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[02:30:59.361 --> 02:31:01.063]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[02:31:13.300 --> 02:31:21.227]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:21.288 --> 02:31:24.370]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[02:31:25.182 --> 02:31:27.023]  And they're also very affordable.
[02:31:27.043 --> 02:31:27.363]  Exactly.
[02:31:27.383 --> 02:31:29.163]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[02:31:29.203 --> 02:31:32.524]  You talk about... We're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[02:31:32.564 --> 02:31:33.705]  We've both talked to them.
[02:31:34.025 --> 02:31:42.988]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[02:31:43.008 --> 02:31:43.528]  Okay?
[02:31:43.868 --> 02:31:44.969]  We refuse to screw people.
[02:31:45.309 --> 02:31:46.289]  We refuse to do that.
[02:31:46.649 --> 02:31:48.650]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[02:31:49.190 --> 02:31:55.916]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[02:31:56.316 --> 02:31:57.077]  It's a win-win.
[02:31:57.557 --> 02:31:58.318]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:03.683 --> 02:32:19.198]  President Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, continued his war against the establishment media yesterday, suggesting that there is a default position amongst biased reporters to assume that the new administration is lying.
[02:32:19.359 --> 02:32:26.686]  And I think that what has happened is that there's this predisposition in the media to, especially with this president,
[02:32:26.986 --> 02:32:31.129]  And I think this idea that we're immediately lying because where are their facts?
[02:32:31.549 --> 02:32:37.312]  Because I got called a liar for something that I can add up and say, here's how we come up with this number.
[02:32:37.472 --> 02:32:45.897]  Meanwhile, over at MSNBC, Chris Matthews continued to openly compare President Donald Trump to murderous dictators.
[02:32:46.337 --> 02:32:48.279]  You're misusing your office thoroughly.
[02:32:48.699 --> 02:32:51.200]  You know, it gets to be like Kim Jong-un.
[02:32:51.380 --> 02:32:52.241]  But who's going to mess with
[02:32:52.321 --> 02:32:54.423]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[02:33:20.242 --> 02:33:25.406]  We're going to go back to the news in a second, but I want to tell you about the specials we've got at infowarslife.com.
[02:33:25.667 --> 02:33:30.050]  And it's an emergency shipment of DNA Force, which is now available.
[02:33:30.611 --> 02:33:39.979]  We sold out of DNA Force over a month ago, but we received a deluge of phone calls and emails from listeners asking us when we're going to get it back in stock.
[02:33:40.019 --> 02:33:41.440]  Well, it is back in stock.
[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:44.543]  We've got a limited emergency shipment of DNA Force.
[02:33:45.953 --> 02:33:48.034]  And it's available at infowarslife.com.
[02:33:48.074 --> 02:33:58.997]  To help you restock, we're giving you 10% off the secret behind DNA Force's powerful line of patented ingredients like Bio-PQQ and systematic enzymes.
[02:33:59.457 --> 02:34:01.078]  Just one ingredient in DNA Force.
[02:34:01.618 --> 02:34:06.982]  Which is the Bio PQQ has been backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[02:34:07.482 --> 02:34:11.364]  Just one batch of this stuff costs us more than 30 grand.
[02:34:11.765 --> 02:34:15.847]  You can see the five-star independent reviews at infowarslife.com.
[02:34:16.088 --> 02:34:20.751]  Take advantage of this emergency shipment and get DNA Force today at infowarslife.com.
[02:34:21.451 --> 02:34:26.494]  Before it sells out again, you can also find all the other great products there.
[02:34:26.534 --> 02:34:28.756]  And again, we're funded by you.
[02:34:28.816 --> 02:34:32.698]  That's very important because we don't have to bend our narrative.
[02:34:33.058 --> 02:34:39.963]  We don't have to get down and kiss the feet of anyone like the fake news media does, like CNN does when they take
[02:34:40.803 --> 02:34:46.147]  Millions and millions from Gulf state dictatorships to air puff pieces about them.
[02:34:46.748 --> 02:34:54.414]  You know, we're not funded by George Soros, like Black Lives Matter is, like all those anti-Trump hysterical protest groups are.
[02:34:54.834 --> 02:34:56.115]  We're only funded by you.
[02:34:56.616 --> 02:34:58.597]  And that makes us authentic, that makes us...
[02:34:59.378 --> 02:35:00.018]  The real deal.
[02:35:00.318 --> 02:35:06.020]  Doesn't make us perfect, we make mistakes, but it means we don't have to deliberately lie to you.
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:07.701]  And that's kind of a big deal.
[02:35:08.321 --> 02:35:19.005]  And even though we don't deliberately lie to you, we still get lectured every day by the actual fake news media who try to attack us, who try to drag us down as we grow, as we eclipse them.
[02:35:19.665 --> 02:35:26.050]  On a day-by-day basis, that's why we need your support by getting the products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:35:26.090 --> 02:35:32.955]  DNA Force, now for a short time only, is back in stock and you get a 10% discount.
[02:35:33.295 --> 02:35:36.157]  That is InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:35:38.098 --> 02:35:40.480]  Now going back to the article we were covering before the break.
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:42.722]  So you have this German newspaper editor.
[02:35:43.522 --> 02:35:59.711]  And publisher Joseph Joffe, who is also apparently somebody told me a Bilderberg member, I haven't had a chance to check that, but he's definitely high up in Germany, he's an elitist, getting up on this news panel show basically saying that Trump should be murdered to get him out of office.
[02:35:59.752 --> 02:36:01.312]  But it was a joke, that's acceptable.
[02:36:01.813 --> 02:36:09.917]  Imagine if, you know, Pat Buchanan had got up or someone like that on Fox News and said that Obama should be murdered to get him out of office.
[02:36:09.937 --> 02:36:12.059]  Do you think the reaction would have been somewhat different?
[02:36:12.699 --> 02:36:22.045]  You know, this guy who had the five-year prison sentence hanging over his head for insulting Erdogan in Turkey, an actual dictator, that was thankfully dropped.
[02:36:22.605 --> 02:36:28.969]  Will this guy have any retribution whatsoever, or will this be allowed to slide?
[02:36:29.450 --> 02:36:30.711]  It's kind of funny, you know, because...
[02:36:31.471 --> 02:36:37.755]  While this is happening, in Germany we have the German government setting up a Ministry of Truth.
[02:36:38.376 --> 02:36:40.257]  This is out of Gatestone Institute.
[02:36:40.918 --> 02:36:51.085]  As reported by Der Spiegel, the Federal Interior Ministry intends to set up a defence centre against disinformation in the fight against fake news on social networks.
[02:36:52.335 --> 02:36:58.738]  And it's basically the same name as the name of the Nazis' military intelligence agency.
[02:36:59.118 --> 02:37:03.200]  It's apparently meant to demonstrate the government's seriousness regarding the matter.
[02:37:04.101 --> 02:37:12.285]  Quote, it sounds like the Ministry of Truth from George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984 wrote, the left-leaning daily Frankfurter Rundschau.
[02:37:13.185 --> 02:37:18.728]  Frank Ueberall, national head of the German Association of Journalists, bluntly stated, this smells like censorship.
[02:37:19.730 --> 02:37:21.230]  So what are they going to censor?
[02:37:21.810 --> 02:37:24.731]  Well, they're going to censor anything that's, quote, populist.
[02:37:25.411 --> 02:37:34.713]  The restriction applies to criticism of the government, especially regarding immigration and energy policies of the EU, and of course of Islam.
[02:37:35.453 --> 02:37:48.075]  So if you dare criticise the unelected European Union, if you dare criticise mass immigration or Islam, then you may become a victim of the Ministry of Truth.
[02:37:49.051 --> 02:37:51.693]  You can read the Federal Agency for Political Education.
[02:37:52.494 --> 02:38:02.942]  Their definition of what they're going to censor is anything, quote, anti-elitism, anti-intellectualism, anti-politics and hostility towards institutions.
[02:38:04.491 --> 02:38:06.752]  In other words, criticism of the government.
[02:38:07.133 --> 02:38:18.280]  So in Germany you can make a joke about assassinating Trump on live television, but don't you dare criticise the EU or mass immigration, because they're going to come after you.
[02:38:18.700 --> 02:38:29.226]  The Ministry of Truth, the ex-Scarzi officials working with Angela Merkel, working with Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook to clamp down on dissent.
[02:38:29.687 --> 02:38:33.149]  But Germany's a liberal, tolerant country.
[02:38:34.229 --> 02:38:47.034]  Now, on the subject of liberal tolerance, we're going to go to this video now, again out of Germany, which shows feminists at an anti-Trump march chanting Allah Akbar.
[02:38:47.514 --> 02:38:48.635]  And my commentary on that.
[02:38:48.675 --> 02:38:49.575]  Let's go to this clip.
[02:38:50.376 --> 02:38:58.719]  That awkward moment when self-proclaimed feminists in Germany embrace the most patriarchal, misogynistic, anti-woman belief system on the planet.
[02:39:11.588 --> 02:39:12.317]  I can't!
[02:39:17.322 --> 02:39:18.483]  I'm not like mine!
[02:39:19.064 --> 02:39:23.067]  Which progressive pro-women facet of Islam do you think they were championing?
[02:39:23.247 --> 02:39:29.532]  Honor killings, female rape victims being stoned to death, mass sexual assaults, forced marriages of children.
[02:39:29.652 --> 02:39:33.395]  A prophet who had female sex slaves and raped a nine-year-old girl.
[02:39:33.735 --> 02:39:35.477]  Female genital mutilation.
[02:39:35.777 --> 02:39:37.959]  So progressive, so liberal.
[02:39:38.079 --> 02:39:42.883]  How about parents acid attacking their own daughter because she looked at a boy?
[02:39:43.228 --> 02:39:51.577]  A mother and father in adjoining cells, accused of dousing their teenage daughter, Anusha, in acid.
[02:39:52.518 --> 02:39:53.178]  Her crime?
[02:39:53.819 --> 02:39:55.120]  Looking at a boy.
[02:39:55.381 --> 02:40:00.226]  And isn't it ironic that they carried signs complaining about their pussies being grabbed?
[02:40:00.746 --> 02:40:05.127]  When that's exactly what Muslim migrants have been doing en masse throughout Germany.
[02:40:05.348 --> 02:40:10.569]  So they hate Trump because he said the words, grab her by the pussy, 12 years ago.
[02:40:10.669 --> 02:40:15.731]  But they want to embrace a culture that justifies literally grabbing women by the pussy.
[02:40:23.303 --> 02:40:27.384]  A culture that gave us something literally called the rape game.
[02:40:27.544 --> 02:40:39.047]  But should we be surprised given that the feminist response to the mass molestation of women in Cologne by Muslim migrants was to visit the local refugee center and give roses to the migrants?
[02:40:39.227 --> 02:40:43.668]  Should we be surprised given that they're bombarded with government TV ads telling them
[02:40:43.968 --> 02:40:46.329]  Enjoy difference, start tolerance.
[02:40:46.549 --> 02:40:48.110]  Trump homophobia.
[02:40:48.170 --> 02:40:52.151]  Granted, that's a fair point because Trump is executing gay people.
[02:40:52.331 --> 02:40:55.593]  Oh no wait, that's what Islamic countries do under Sharia law.
[02:40:55.713 --> 02:41:01.075]  Oh yeah, and talking of Sharia law, who was one of the main organisers behind the Women's March in DC?
[02:41:01.155 --> 02:41:08.278]  Lisa Sansour, a Muslim activist who advocates for Sharia law, a doctrine that completely disenfranchises women.
[02:41:08.358 --> 02:41:10.519]  Sharia law versus women's rights.
[02:41:10.819 --> 02:41:13.360]  Yeah, pick one because you can't have both.
[02:41:13.580 --> 02:41:16.901]  Some of the attendees at the Women's March in DC wore hijabs.
[02:41:17.101 --> 02:41:20.982]  Probably not for the same reason that Muslim women in the Middle East wear hijabs.
[02:41:21.142 --> 02:41:23.283]  Which is so they don't get beaten and raped.
[02:41:23.423 --> 02:41:28.805]  But let's just keep on pretending that the hijab isn't an international symbol for the oppression of women.
[02:41:29.045 --> 02:41:29.425]  Okay.
[02:41:29.625 --> 02:41:32.026]  Islam does not silence me, it empowers me!
[02:41:32.086 --> 02:41:37.508]  Yeah, try and protest for women's rights in Saudi Arabia and see how empowered you feel.
[02:41:37.768 --> 02:41:38.508]  Good luck!
[02:41:38.688 --> 02:41:46.611]  Oh yeah, and the only people who marched on the Saudi embassy, you know, an Islamic theocracy that actually oppresses women, were Trump supporters.
[02:41:46.691 --> 02:41:48.212]  Well, imagine my shock!
[02:41:48.392 --> 02:41:50.213]  This is what I've warned about for years.
[02:41:50.273 --> 02:41:55.315]  The left is now openly making an alliance with Islamists and Islamism.
[02:41:55.335 --> 02:41:58.756]  And it kind of makes sense because both Islamists and the far left
[02:41:58.916 --> 02:41:58.976]  Yes!
[02:42:26.258 --> 02:42:30.922]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[02:42:31.022 --> 02:42:37.067]  Leftists all over Twitter celebrating and advocating violent attacks on people with whom they disagree politically.
[02:42:37.147 --> 02:42:39.970]  Violent attacks to advance a political objective.
[02:42:40.310 --> 02:42:43.693]  Now what word could we possibly use to describe that?
[02:42:44.213 --> 02:42:44.653]  Hmm.
[02:42:45.174 --> 02:42:45.995]  I wonder.
[02:42:46.115 --> 02:42:47.256]  Yeah, but he's a Nazi.
[02:42:47.316 --> 02:42:48.677]  Why are you defending a Nazi?
[02:42:48.717 --> 02:42:50.438]  Yeah, that's got nothing to do with it.
[02:42:50.498 --> 02:42:55.863]  The far left literally labels anyone who disagrees with them as a Nazi.
[02:42:55.923 --> 02:43:02.448]  You can't go around punching people in the street because you claim they're a Nazi, whether they're actually a Nazi or not.
[02:43:02.648 --> 02:43:07.529]  Violently attacking people in the street to intimidate them out of expressing their political beliefs.
[02:43:07.870 --> 02:43:09.830]  Now, where have I seen that before?
[02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:10.630]  Oh, that's right!
[02:43:10.730 --> 02:43:11.991]  In Nazi Germany!
[02:43:12.111 --> 02:43:13.311]  Yeah, let's be like them!
[02:43:13.491 --> 02:43:14.411]  Great idea!
[02:43:14.491 --> 02:43:18.833]  So the left is embracing Islamism, the most intolerant belief system on earth.
[02:43:19.033 --> 02:43:20.513]  They're embracing intimidation.
[02:43:20.693 --> 02:43:22.194]  They're embracing violence.
[02:43:22.314 --> 02:43:26.555]  They're embracing completely deranged, frothing, hysterical behavior.
[02:43:38.012 --> 02:43:43.234]  While chanting love Trump's hate and banging on about how peaceful and tolerant they are.
[02:43:43.294 --> 02:43:52.616]  While the leftist media legitimizes all this violence and hatred by refusing to denounce it and labeling it as just another form of protest.
[02:43:52.776 --> 02:43:56.538]  You're witnessing the submission and capitulation of the West.
[02:43:56.998 --> 02:44:00.979]  But it can only take place with the willing complicity of the left.
[02:44:01.519 --> 02:44:09.303]  Who have now brazenly decided to make an alliance with the most regressive belief system ever devised.
[02:44:22.879 --> 02:44:26.761]  Called the Left and Islam the Unholy Alliance.
[02:44:26.801 --> 02:44:30.204]  That is up on the Prison Planet Live YouTube channel.
[02:44:30.284 --> 02:44:31.364]  Get it, share it.
[02:44:31.824 --> 02:44:40.310]  On that same subject, of course, we told you about Linda Sarsour, one of the main organizers of the George Soros-funded Women's March.
[02:44:40.970 --> 02:44:43.091]  Which had nothing whatsoever to do with women.
[02:44:43.251 --> 02:44:47.314]  It was another hysterical anti-Trump demonstration.
[02:44:48.034 --> 02:44:50.415]  But they said, oh, this is a women's march.
[02:44:50.435 --> 02:44:52.637]  How could you possibly oppose a women's march?
[02:44:52.657 --> 02:44:53.557]  You must hate women!
[02:44:54.818 --> 02:45:07.205]  Well, no, it was a far-left anti-Trump march, funded by George Soros, organised by a woman who literally supports Sharia law, which completely disenfranchises women.
[02:45:08.300 --> 02:45:08.720]  Okay?
[02:45:09.301 --> 02:45:10.582]  This is the doctrine.
[02:45:10.902 --> 02:45:17.967]  This is the legal doctrine under which it takes three female witnesses just to match one male witness in court.
[02:45:18.627 --> 02:45:22.690]  Basically, women are treated as second-class citizens under Sharia law.
[02:45:23.230 --> 02:45:28.794]  This is the foundation of the system that leads to women being stoned to death.
[02:45:29.154 --> 02:45:32.737]  That leads to women having their genitals mutilated.
[02:45:32.937 --> 02:45:34.698]  That leads to honour killings.
[02:45:34.958 --> 02:45:36.940]  That leads to forced marriages.
[02:45:37.881 --> 02:45:41.904]  Yeah, that doesn't sound like something that meshes with women's rights to me.
[02:45:42.164 --> 02:45:46.367]  But this is the individual who was one of the organisers behind that.
[02:45:46.447 --> 02:45:50.229]  Linda Sarsour, somebody who also supports a terrorist group, Hamas.
[02:45:50.890 --> 02:45:54.092]  Somebody who also gives the ISIS one-finger salute.
[02:45:54.352 --> 02:45:56.653]  This is your big women's rights champion, OK?
[02:45:57.794 --> 02:46:13.218]  So she was criticised for those beliefs, and then the Southern Poverty Law Centre, which is another hate group, claims to track hate groups, actually is one, paints targets on people's backs, so then they can be targeted for hate.
[02:46:14.098 --> 02:46:20.320]  They came out and said that anyone who basically criticises Linda Sarsour is engaging in Islamophobia.
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:25.041]  So now it's Islamophobic to criticise Sharia law.
[02:46:26.684 --> 02:46:37.975]  They labelled Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Majeed Nawaz, who are Muslim reformers, or at least ex-Muslim reformers, they labelled them as anti-Islamic extremists.
[02:46:38.595 --> 02:46:40.056]  They put them on lists.
[02:46:40.814 --> 02:46:44.696]  With hope, not hate, saying that they were anti-Islamic extremists.
[02:46:45.077 --> 02:47:02.567]  Bearing in mind this is somebody in Ayaan Hirsi Ali, whose colleague was murdered on the streets of Amsterdam by an Islamic jihadist, who pinned a note on his victim saying that Ayaan Hirsi Ali would be next.
[02:47:03.953 --> 02:47:21.023]  So you have the Southern Poverty Law Centre, these left-wing hope-not-hate groups, actually conspiring with Islamic jihadists to paint targets on the back of people who simply say that Islam is a 7th century religion and is in need of reform.
[02:47:21.644 --> 02:47:24.966]  These are the people who support Linda Sarsour.
[02:47:25.486 --> 02:47:26.827]  This is out of the Daily Wire.
[02:47:27.998 --> 02:47:30.800]  The Southern Law Poverty Centre is a joke and this proves it.
[02:47:31.400 --> 02:47:49.932]  The Southern Poverty Law Centre, as Daily Wire's Aaron Bandler wrote in his article, is a leftist hack advocacy group which picks and chooses what standards to apply to its labels, consistently turning a blind eye to leftist and pro-democrat groups and individuals, while targeting, often unfairly, their enemies on the right.
[02:47:50.612 --> 02:48:05.518]  Over the past few days, SPLC continued to protect hard left and Islamist radicals in the name of the progressive cause by joining the chorus of left-wing organisations and leftist commentators in rushing to support Linda Sarsour.
[02:48:06.738 --> 02:48:08.419]  And this was their tweet, SPLC.
[02:48:09.260 --> 02:48:14.064]  Islamophobes have been attacking Women's March organiser Linda Sarsour.
[02:48:14.364 --> 02:48:17.027]  We stand with her against this type of hate and bigotry.
[02:48:17.667 --> 02:48:29.617]  So this is the group that literally paints targets on the back of people who have been targeted for assassination by Islamic jihadists and they're saying that they stand against hate and bigotry.
[02:48:29.737 --> 02:48:29.978]  Okay.
[02:48:31.195 --> 02:48:45.025]  Sticking to its modus operandi, SPLC labels anyone who questions Sarsour's Islamist and regressive tendencies as Islamophobes, again because they don't have an actual argument, they just slap a word on it, while committing themselves to combating hate and bigotry.
[02:48:45.545 --> 02:48:49.808]  This begs the question of when SPLC will condemn some of Sarsour's own commentary.
[02:48:50.349 --> 02:48:51.450]  And you can see in this article...
[02:48:52.170 --> 02:49:02.696]  They used her own tweets where she supports Sharia law, a doctrine that treats women little better than farmyard animals and treats them as second-class citizens.
[02:49:02.976 --> 02:49:06.097]  This is the organiser behind the Women's March.
[02:49:07.478 --> 02:49:12.841]  What SPLC does not want to address is that Sharia law permits husbands beating their wives.
[02:49:13.761 --> 02:49:14.922]  Oh yes, that's progressive now.
[02:49:15.582 --> 02:49:17.844]  Executing gay people, that's also liberal.
[02:49:18.649 --> 02:49:25.876]  Again, you had the anti-Trump hysterical people out there saying that Trump would strip away gay people's rights, lock them up.
[02:49:26.576 --> 02:49:30.540]  They didn't march on Saudi Arabian embassy, did they, which actually kills gay people?
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:31.781]  No, that would be racist.
[02:49:32.421 --> 02:49:35.945]  And other despicable things that would never be tolerated in Western civilization.
[02:49:37.352 --> 02:49:45.237]  So you have the organiser of the Women's March supporting the doctrine that allows wives to be beaten by their husbands.
[02:49:45.617 --> 02:49:47.978]  She's the big feminist women's rights champion.
[02:49:48.319 --> 02:49:50.820]  Now she's being defended by the SPLC.
[02:49:50.860 --> 02:49:53.922]  Because again, they don't care about women's rights.
[02:49:54.282 --> 02:49:56.323]  They don't care about minorities' rights.
[02:49:56.584 --> 02:49:58.305]  They care about power.
[02:49:58.985 --> 02:50:01.627]  And demonising their political adversaries.
[02:50:01.927 --> 02:50:04.349]  And they do it at every single turn.
[02:50:04.589 --> 02:50:13.817]  They paint giant targets on the back of Muslim reformers who have been the victims of actual assassination attempts by Islamic jihadists.
[02:50:14.037 --> 02:50:15.018]  Let that sink in.
[02:50:16.001 --> 02:50:30.226]  The article goes on, instead of teaching the nation about Sharia law's regressive and liberal tenets, SPLC will dedicate its resources to defending its proponents like Sarsour and blacklisting Muslim reformers like Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Majeed Nawaz.
[02:50:30.786 --> 02:50:32.666]  The SPLC is a hate group.
[02:50:33.327 --> 02:50:40.609]  It targets people who are working peacefully in the world to try and eliminate actual hate and violence.
[02:50:41.169 --> 02:50:42.610]  Those are the people it targets.
[02:50:43.510 --> 02:50:45.591]  While calling them hateful bigots.
[02:50:46.451 --> 02:50:48.012]  That's how the SPLC works.
[02:50:48.392 --> 02:50:50.112]  That's why it got its funding withdrawn.
[02:50:50.452 --> 02:50:54.174]  The SPLC, the Southern Poverty Law Center, is a hate group.
[02:50:54.234 --> 02:50:55.734]  It's proven it time and time again.
[02:50:55.774 --> 02:50:58.475]  We will be back with a final segment on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:58.515 --> 02:50:59.756]  Infowars.com.
[02:51:00.156 --> 02:51:00.616]  Stay tuned.
[02:51:03.637 --> 02:51:08.079]  This has been adopted as of 2017 by the Department of Defense.
[02:51:08.639 --> 02:51:10.059]  All four branches of the military.
[02:51:10.740 --> 02:51:11.560]  Combat One.
[02:51:12.657 --> 02:51:20.475]  And guess who in the spring of 2017 has the exclusive right to sell this to everybody else?
[02:51:21.650 --> 02:51:22.811]  But the military.
[02:51:23.711 --> 02:51:25.192]  Infowars.com.
[02:51:25.852 --> 02:51:29.454]  I want to commend Q and Patrick and the rest of our team.
[02:51:29.494 --> 02:51:32.715]  I want to commend Combat One for getting the big Pentagon deal.
[02:51:33.336 --> 02:51:36.117]  And I want to thank them for supporting us because they know we support America.
[02:51:36.437 --> 02:51:49.944]  We are the exclusive source of Combat One skin and muscle optimization, field foam, field spray, skin and muscle optimization, and broad spectrum hygiene, tactical bath,
[02:51:50.504 --> 02:51:52.345]  Contains eight pre-moistened cloths.
[02:51:52.965 --> 02:52:02.770]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are incredibly affordable and they have patented proprietary systems that annihilate germs, you name it, across the board.
[02:52:03.071 --> 02:52:08.153]  That's why it's been adopted by the Pentagon, by the Defense Department, system-wide.
[02:52:08.193 --> 02:52:15.057]  I'm going to go over some of the numbers, some of the proven statistics and the claims that Combat One can make right now.
[02:52:15.917 --> 02:52:24.965]  Never before has the public been able to access this new Combat One military-grade hygiene technology used by special operations to maintain hygiene during survival situations.
[02:52:25.325 --> 02:52:27.427]  Studied for safety and effectiveness by St.
[02:52:27.467 --> 02:52:29.548]  John's Medical Research Institute, St.
[02:52:29.608 --> 02:52:37.355]  Jude's, and the American Journal of Infection Control, the technology behind Combat One wipes kills bad bacteria while leaving beneficial
[02:52:38.055 --> 02:52:39.536]  Skin bacteria unharmed.
[02:52:39.636 --> 02:52:40.676]  That's the key buffer.
[02:52:40.937 --> 02:52:45.659]  The toxic wipes, the sanitizers kill everything, including your immune system.
[02:52:45.679 --> 02:52:46.620]  They lower your fertility.
[02:52:46.640 --> 02:52:47.160]  It's all admitted.
[02:52:47.760 --> 02:52:51.082]  Combat One is able to do this naturally by only targeting the bad stuff.
[02:52:51.522 --> 02:52:52.423]  And again, it's all patented.
[02:52:52.443 --> 02:52:53.683]  It's super secret.
[02:52:53.844 --> 02:52:55.524]  12 years, special forces testing it.
[02:52:56.125 --> 02:53:01.508]  This is something every info warrior needs to order, needs to have in their home, needs to use in their daily lives.
[02:53:01.828 --> 02:53:05.410]  Whether it's cleaning your guns or your own skin, or when you're out camping,
[02:53:06.050 --> 02:53:07.214]  This is the game changer.
[02:53:07.234 --> 02:53:12.111]  The entire family of Combat One is available exclusively at m4warstore.com.
[02:53:13.342 --> 02:53:16.704]  Just coming back from the river where I was using one of our water filtration straws.
[02:53:17.304 --> 02:53:19.625]  A certain device we sell here at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:53:20.325 --> 02:53:24.727]  And I had to smack my knuckle pretty hard the other day with my knife after cleaning one of the animals.
[02:53:24.747 --> 02:53:30.690]  So I'm going to use some Combat One foam to show you guys that we actually use it, how well it works.
[02:53:31.711 --> 02:53:33.832]  This wound's been open for about five days now.
[02:53:34.592 --> 02:53:36.133]  I just dipped it in and out of the river.
[02:53:36.473 --> 02:53:38.514]  So just a better safe than sorry.
[02:53:47.975 --> 02:53:51.377]  Once I let that soak in, I'll wrap it up, feel dressed nice and clean again.
[02:53:52.157 --> 02:53:54.939]  And it certainly is coming to the rescue with Combat One.
[02:53:55.279 --> 02:53:56.400]  Born in America.
[02:53:56.860 --> 02:53:57.760]  Made in America.
[02:53:58.040 --> 02:54:00.862]  And now distributed by InfoWars to America.
[02:54:19.286 --> 02:54:23.309]  You're live in this final segment of this hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:23.329 --> 02:54:29.654]  I'm Paul Joseph Cox, and well, we've got a story up on Drudge, which is talking about the elite buying armoured redoubts in New Zealand.
[02:54:30.294 --> 02:54:34.577]  Probably a good time to take advantage of this deal, which is up on Infowarsstore.com.
[02:54:34.637 --> 02:54:36.699]  Tactical nanotechnology body armour.
[02:54:37.179 --> 02:54:42.803]  Previously only available to military and law enforcement, now exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:54:43.243 --> 02:54:48.566]  Again, you have the elite talking about buying nuclear-proof bunkers.
[02:54:49.027 --> 02:54:52.949]  Maybe it's time to stock up on your emergency preparedness supplies.
[02:54:53.569 --> 02:55:00.274]  Over the past year, InfoWars has been working with some of the top special operators in the United States to source you the absolute highest quality
[02:55:00.874 --> 02:55:02.375]  An affordable body armor out there.
[02:55:02.955 --> 02:55:11.241]  We've worked with our team of former Blackwater operators and Army Rangers, analyzed and tested hundreds of different body armor technologies for their stopping power and safety.
[02:55:11.962 --> 02:55:13.122]  This is the best.
[02:55:13.623 --> 02:55:14.884]  This is game-changing.
[02:55:14.944 --> 02:55:15.724]  It's waterproof.
[02:55:15.764 --> 02:55:16.705]  It's super lightweight.
[02:55:17.245 --> 02:55:20.407]  Made in the USA and it comes with a 20-year warranty.
[02:55:21.408 --> 02:55:23.331]  Check it out at Infowars.com.
[02:55:23.511 --> 02:55:31.882]  Also take a look at the exclusive line of tactical nanotechnology body armor previously only available to the US military and law enforcement.
[02:55:32.763 --> 02:55:34.926]  The elite is panicking.
[02:55:34.986 --> 02:55:38.310]  They're still running to their armored redoubts even after
[02:55:39.071 --> 02:55:47.394]  The warmongering whore, Hillary Clinton, lost and didn't get her opportunity to start a war with Russia, but the elite are still buying their underground bunkers.
[02:55:47.794 --> 02:55:59.159]  So why wouldn't you want to take advantage for insurance purposes of that offer at infowarsstore.com and of course support this broadcast as it's under attack on a constant basis?
[02:56:00.279 --> 02:56:05.040]  Now I mentioned that story there, it is on Infowars out of RT, also up on the Drudge Report.
[02:56:05.540 --> 02:56:05.721]  U.S.
[02:56:05.781 --> 02:56:09.902]  elites buying New Zealand redoubts to escape crack-up of civilisation.
[02:56:10.382 --> 02:56:12.522]  Wealthy Americans are preparing for a possible U.S.
[02:56:12.562 --> 02:56:14.423]  collapse or a revolt by the poor.
[02:56:14.443 --> 02:56:17.864]  They're buying properties in New Zealand, the New Yorker magazine reported.
[02:56:18.988 --> 02:56:28.336]  Now if it is going to be a revolt by the poor, if it is going to be a French Revolution-style apocalypse purge, then they've only got themselves to blame.
[02:56:28.757 --> 02:56:34.341]  They were the ones who spun the narrative that Donald Trump was literally Hitler, that he was going to blow up the world.
[02:56:35.002 --> 02:56:41.387]  They were the ones who created the environment that gave us Trump Derangement Syndrome.
[02:56:42.068 --> 02:56:49.385]  These hysterical, maniacal, violent, aggressive, quote, protesters going nuts across the nation.
[02:56:49.425 --> 02:56:50.808]  And they will continue to do so.
[02:56:51.653 --> 02:56:55.814]  So the elite, they created the environment for this, they only have themselves to blame.
[02:56:56.435 --> 02:57:03.397]  According to writer Evan Osnos, preppers from Silicon Valley and New York are getting ready for the crack-up of civilization.
[02:57:04.077 --> 02:57:12.820]  One American hedge fund manager who owns two New Zealand homes told Osnos he expected at least a decade of political turmoil in the United States.
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:20.283]  PayPal co-founder and Facebook investor Peter Thiel also owns property there and has described New Zealand as a utopia.
[02:57:21.786 --> 02:57:28.432]  Listen to what Reid Hoffman, who is the LinkedIn co-founder, said about what's happening in New Zealand.
[02:57:28.573 --> 02:57:33.858]  He said, quote, saying you're buying a house in New Zealand is kind of a wink wink, say no more.
[02:57:33.998 --> 02:57:41.765]  Once you've done the Masonic handshake, they'll be like, oh, you know, I have a broker who sells old ICBM silos and they're nuclear hardened.
[02:57:42.386 --> 02:57:45.049]  And they kind of look like they would be an interesting place to live in.
[02:57:45.730 --> 02:57:48.833]  So, you've got the insiders with a nod and a wink.
[02:57:48.913 --> 02:57:51.976]  They know what they're talking about as they do the Masonic handshakes.
[02:57:52.557 --> 02:58:00.485]  The elite still panics about the potential crack-up of civilization running to their armoured redoubts.
[02:58:01.025 --> 02:58:03.868]  Is it going to be an uprising of the poor?
[02:58:03.989 --> 02:58:04.789]  If it is, again,
[02:58:05.490 --> 02:58:07.352]  It's by their own creation.
[02:58:07.872 --> 02:58:15.478]  They created the policies which created this massive wealth disparity, declining wage increases versus interest.
[02:58:15.518 --> 02:58:19.941]  They're the ones who created this hysteria surrounding the presidency of Donald Trump.
[02:58:21.122 --> 02:58:30.587]  So yeah, they'd probably be in a position to know if there was a French Revolution-style uprising in the offing for the United States over the next 10 years.
[02:58:30.667 --> 02:58:32.828]  So they're still buying those armoured redoubts.
[02:58:33.529 --> 02:58:37.371]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show in the next segment.
[02:58:37.411 --> 02:58:39.552]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[02:58:39.632 --> 02:58:40.432]  Don't go away.
[02:58:43.514 --> 02:58:45.035]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.770 --> 02:58:48.972]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[02:58:57.475 --> 02:58:58.976]  There is a crisis in America today.
[02:58:59.436 --> 02:59:01.837]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[02:59:02.157 --> 02:59:09.561]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[02:59:09.941 --> 02:59:13.563]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[02:59:13.903 --> 02:59:15.104]  I have the answer for you today.
[02:59:15.464 --> 02:59:16.545]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[02:59:17.365 --> 02:59:20.408]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone, and it's safe.
[02:59:20.969 --> 02:59:22.671]  No radiation compartment.
[02:59:23.111 --> 02:59:28.857]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[02:59:29.698 --> 02:59:32.160]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[02:59:32.360 --> 02:59:38.326]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[02:59:39.087 --> 02:59:40.747]  With a blocky pocket, this is impossible.
[02:59:41.228 --> 02:59:43.908]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[02:59:44.228 --> 02:59:52.711]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own blocky pocket.
[02:59:54.591 --> 03:00:00.493]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:04.543 --> 03:00:11.265]  They took my saddle in Houston, broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[03:00:12.506 --> 03:00:18.548]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[03:00:18.568 --> 03:00:21.609]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[03:00:21.649 --> 03:00:24.910]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[03:00:27.727 --> 03:00:31.171]  Roger Stone is coming up with the fourth hour, but now we're going to go to this clip.
[03:00:31.231 --> 03:00:33.293]  I was talking about the issue before the break.
[03:00:33.753 --> 03:00:39.640]  The SPLC running defense for Linda Sarsour, the big champion of women's rights.
[03:00:39.740 --> 03:00:43.584]  She also supports Sharia law, which is the opposite of women's rights.
[03:00:43.984 --> 03:00:47.868]  So the SPLC, the left, are out running defense after she was criticized.
[03:00:48.830 --> 03:00:56.190]  And Liz Wheeler filed this report exposing the sheer hypocrisy behind the entire Women's Rights March.
[03:00:56.251 --> 03:00:56.652]  Here it is.
[03:00:57.819 --> 03:01:00.021]  What exactly does the Women's March want?
[03:01:00.141 --> 03:01:02.043]  I'm totally serious here, this is not a rhetorical trap.
[03:01:02.243 --> 03:01:03.885]  What was the objective of that march?
[03:01:04.465 --> 03:01:14.835]  These women in their pink genitalia hats, screaming in pain at the idea of President Trump, something like 2 million women worldwide, I find it very suspicious that none of them could articulate exactly what their march was about.
[03:01:15.336 --> 03:01:18.839]  Women's rights, I heard that a couple times, but what women's rights are in jeopardy here?
[03:01:19.019 --> 03:01:26.364]  Please tell me, law by law, line by line, statute by statute, what exactly is President Trump going to damage or what rights is he going to deprive women?
[03:01:26.684 --> 03:01:27.244]  Tell me please!
[03:01:27.564 --> 03:01:30.846]  I'm an independent woman, I want to stick up for women's rights, especially if they're on the chopping block.
[03:01:31.187 --> 03:01:36.030]  I have a platform, I can make a difference, but I cannot find women's rights at risk under President Trump.
[03:01:36.870 --> 03:01:45.595]  Some of you talked about misogyny, but that can't be right either, because you voted for Hillary Clinton, who willingly accepted $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where women are veiled, abused, oppressed, and killed.
[03:01:46.175 --> 03:01:52.258]  Your rude comments about First Lady Melania Trump were okay, some others said, because she's enabling a misogynist by staying married to him.
[03:01:52.919 --> 03:01:58.982]  Again, you voted for Hillary, she's still with Bill, he was actually impeached for lying about his extramarital sexual shenanigans.
[03:01:59.722 --> 03:02:04.505]  Some of you said you were protesting homophobia, but that can't be it either because President Trump is the first president in U.S.
[03:02:04.545 --> 03:02:06.666]  history to take office supporting gay marriage.
[03:02:07.426 --> 03:02:11.809]  A few of you had signs that read, science, which I found particularly odd.
[03:02:12.209 --> 03:02:15.691]  Apparently you're not talking about science that says unborn baby is a human being.
[03:02:16.051 --> 03:02:20.454]  You didn't celebrate motherhood, the most mystical, magical, wonderful, feminine experience.
[03:02:20.554 --> 03:02:22.355]  Instead, you seem to promote vulgarity.
[03:02:23.115 --> 03:02:26.496]  So Occam's razor at work here leaves us with two demands from the Women's March.
[03:02:27.036 --> 03:02:28.857]  One, you want free birth control.
[03:02:28.937 --> 03:02:31.938]  And two, you want unlimited access to abortion for any reason.
[03:02:32.218 --> 03:02:33.858]  And you'd love if taxpayers paid the tab.
[03:02:34.418 --> 03:02:36.019]  That's why you kicked out pro-life feminists.
[03:02:36.059 --> 03:02:38.380]  That's why you refused to publish a goal for your march.
[03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:43.021]  It's too disgusting to admit that two million women just marched to celebrate killing our unborn children.
[03:02:43.421 --> 03:02:46.622]  And you're too entitled to spend four bucks at CVS and buy yourself protection.
[03:02:47.262 --> 03:02:49.303]  Sounds pretty nasty when the truth is exposed, huh?
[03:02:50.063 --> 03:02:52.885]  And to boot, these women left their trash for others to clean up.
[03:02:53.045 --> 03:02:56.147]  Something symbolic there, and certainly nothing to be proud of.
[03:02:57.048 --> 03:02:58.089]  And that's my final point tonight.
[03:02:58.209 --> 03:03:00.110]  You can reach me on Twitter at Liz underscore Wheeler.
[03:03:00.330 --> 03:03:03.833]  If you like the show, please send me an email at OANN.com slash contact.
[03:03:04.313 --> 03:03:09.737]  Don't forget, if you miss an episode of Tipping Point, you can now go back and watch the archives of two weeks ago on CloudTV.com.
[03:03:10.197 --> 03:03:12.039]  So there we have Liz Wheeler again.
[03:03:12.939 --> 03:03:15.320]  Exposing the hypocrisy behind the women's rights march.
[03:03:15.420 --> 03:03:21.001]  Isn't it ironic that they were there complaining about Donald Trump objectifying women?
[03:03:21.041 --> 03:03:31.243]  In fact, we had another clip yesterday which was in an article about the feminist, you know, attacking the cameraman of the woman who was carrying a sign saying, Islam is misogynistic.
[03:03:31.483 --> 03:03:33.504]  That was particularly triggering to them.
[03:03:34.224 --> 03:03:37.768]  Even though Islam is the most anti-woman belief system on the planet.
[03:03:38.208 --> 03:03:40.851]  But if you question that, then the feminists attack you.
[03:03:41.272 --> 03:03:48.980]  But they were also complaining about Donald Trump's rhetoric objectifying women while literally dressed as vaginas.
[03:03:50.882 --> 03:03:52.403]  Yeah, how does that work out for you?
[03:03:52.804 --> 03:03:54.525]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:03:54.645 --> 03:03:56.887]  It wasn't a women's march.
[03:03:57.027 --> 03:03:59.690]  It was a leftist anti-Trump march.
[03:04:00.170 --> 03:04:01.051]  Rebranded.
[03:04:01.291 --> 03:04:02.192]  That's all it was.
[03:04:02.872 --> 03:04:06.415]  It was an excuse for Madonna, again, to get up on stage.
[03:04:07.316 --> 03:04:30.408]  And play along with this narrative that it's suddenly okay for the left to engage in flagrant, violent threats against Trump, against Trump supporters, while claiming that they're peaceful and tolerance, and that love Trump's hate, while they literally spit on Trump supporters, set fire to their hair, punch them in the face, run after them, attack their cameraman.
[03:04:31.872 --> 03:04:33.113]  But love trumps hate.
[03:04:33.433 --> 03:04:35.094]  These are the people that we're dealing with.
[03:04:35.394 --> 03:04:45.799]  This is the environment of violence and thuggery that has been legitimized by the mainstream media since even before Ferguson, you know, Time Magazine, in defense of rioting.
[03:04:45.899 --> 03:04:48.120]  That was the most recent origin of it.
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:04:55.209]  Now the intensity is increasing as they legitimize actual terrorism in America.
[03:04:55.590 --> 03:04:58.614]  Roger Stone is coming up with the fourth hour and more breaking news.
[03:04:58.654 --> 03:04:59.676]  Be sure to stay tuned.
[03:05:00.056 --> 03:05:00.778]  That's it for me.
[03:05:00.878 --> 03:05:02.079]  InfoWars.com
[03:05:02.978 --> 03:05:15.021]  ABC has the first one-on-one interview with President Trump, and they are taking ownership of what should be public information, listing unprecedented restrictions on the publishing of that information.
[03:05:15.221 --> 03:05:20.823]  They're mandating on-screen credits, mandating that any excerpts must be introduced with an audio credit.
[03:05:21.103 --> 03:05:23.563]  They put limits on how long the excerpts can be.
[03:05:23.723 --> 03:05:26.524]  They put a time limit on how long material can be used.
[03:05:26.624 --> 03:05:29.105]  No material may be used after February the 1st.
[03:05:29.665 --> 03:05:35.229]  This is a desperate bid by ABC to circumvent freedom of the press and fair use.
[03:05:35.549 --> 03:05:45.556]  They're trying to take control of Trump's message, trying to monopolize it, both to monetize it and to spin it as they wish for political purposes, even banning future use of it.
[03:05:45.936 --> 03:05:51.540]  Extraordinary copyright claims and enforcement were a major problem with the TPP that Trump just shut down.
[03:05:51.700 --> 03:05:57.544]  And he should shut down this desperate attempt by ABC to try to copyright what the president says in interviews.
[03:05:57.944 --> 03:05:59.804]  That is not appropriate.
[03:05:59.924 --> 03:06:01.965]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.

[03:08:21.661 --> 03:08:23.082]  Welcome to InfoWars.
[03:08:23.262 --> 03:08:27.024]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:08:28.484 --> 03:08:38.209]  First of all, I want to thank the thousands and thousands of people who expressed concern about my health and sent their best wishes to get well soon.
[03:08:38.229 --> 03:08:47.694]  You know, prayer has power, and I'm deeply appreciative of all those Americans and all those Trumpsters who reached out to me.
[03:08:48.454 --> 03:08:50.695]  It means a great deal to me and my family.
[03:08:50.795 --> 03:08:53.316]  I am feeling better, not at full strength.
[03:08:54.376 --> 03:09:00.058]  The inaugural was taxing, but the most fun and the most exciting that I'd ever been to.
[03:09:01.039 --> 03:09:04.320]  So many thanks for your cards and letters and emails.
[03:09:04.880 --> 03:09:07.061]  I am most definitely on the mend.
[03:09:08.281 --> 03:09:11.904]  Now I want to talk to one of the most erudite guys around.
[03:09:13.045 --> 03:09:27.315]  Filmmaker, conservative activist, musician, Bob Dylan expert, who often plays with one of the greatest Dylan tribute bands in the country, Joel Gilbert joins us from Hollywood.
[03:09:27.335 --> 03:09:29.457]  Joel, welcome to InfoWars.
[03:09:30.236 --> 03:09:31.036]  Great to be here, Roger.
[03:09:31.056 --> 03:09:32.857]  You're looking good.
[03:09:32.997 --> 03:09:33.938]  Feeling much better.
[03:09:33.958 --> 03:09:45.063]  Now, your film, Dreams of the Father, I believe, or Tracking Obama, really enlightens us a lot about his background.
[03:09:45.584 --> 03:09:49.686]  And now, of course, there's widespread conversation about his legacy.
[03:09:50.246 --> 03:09:57.670]  What is your take, having studied this man so carefully, what is your take on Obama and what is your take on his legacy?
[03:09:58.490 --> 03:10:01.231]  And what do you think he's planning to do going forward?
[03:10:02.111 --> 03:10:03.091]  Okay, thanks.
[03:10:03.211 --> 03:10:07.112]  Well, look, Obama was trained as a professional agitator.
[03:10:07.772 --> 03:10:14.234]  His job was officially community organizer, but that was the official name for community agitator.
[03:10:14.754 --> 03:10:25.297]  And as I showed in my film, the job was, and I'm quoting from their literature, the job was to rub salt in the wounds of minorities and then use their discontent to take power.
[03:10:25.837 --> 03:10:26.257]  Unquote.
[03:10:27.273 --> 03:10:34.259]  So we've seen from Obama's years in office, let's take a look at his farewell speech.
[03:10:35.279 --> 03:10:40.784]  He expressed the same kind of nonsense that he did when he was running for office.
[03:10:40.804 --> 03:10:42.365]  It was almost a campaign speech.
[03:10:42.405 --> 03:10:46.308]  He talked about slavery and Jim Crow and how that
[03:10:47.429 --> 03:10:55.474]  You know, we've divided, the country is divided with these 1%, these evil boogeyman who's taking all your money.
[03:10:55.694 --> 03:11:00.616]  And if you just give us the power, we'll get that money back from the boogeyman and give it to you.
[03:11:01.597 --> 03:11:04.779]  For Marxists like Obama, America is hell.
[03:11:05.819 --> 03:11:10.402]  Because they compare America to the perfect socialist utopia that's unattainable.
[03:11:10.942 --> 03:11:16.506]  So their conclusion is America is therefore evil and must be torn down and rebuilt to make the perfect world.
[03:11:17.167 --> 03:11:19.288]  Conservatives have a different view of the world.
[03:11:19.328 --> 03:11:29.294]  We look at other countries and compare them to America and say, well, America is a society that has individual rights, individual liberty, and we can pursue happiness.
[03:11:29.675 --> 03:11:32.597]  So we're happy in America as opposed to the left who are miserable.
[03:11:33.601 --> 03:11:39.065]  So Obama presented what was his legacy of lies in his speech.
[03:11:39.105 --> 03:11:41.307]  He talked about, I rebooted the auto industry.
[03:11:41.707 --> 03:11:44.529]  Well, no, he just transferred the debt to the American taxpayer.
[03:11:45.130 --> 03:11:47.872]  He said, I've had the longest stretch of employment growth.
[03:11:48.012 --> 03:11:48.893]  Well, no, that's a lie.
[03:11:48.933 --> 03:11:49.773]  It's really about 20%.
[03:11:50.314 --> 03:11:52.736]  It's just that so many people, as you know, left the workforce.
[03:11:53.436 --> 03:11:55.818]  He talked about, I opened a new chapter in Cuba.
[03:11:56.299 --> 03:11:57.020]  Well, no, that's a lie.
[03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:04.226]  You just propped up these communist dictators that you've worshipped for all these years so you could go to a baseball game with Raul Castro.
[03:12:05.216 --> 03:12:09.960]  He said, you know, I stopped the Iranian nuclear program without firing a shot.
[03:12:10.560 --> 03:12:21.348]  Well, no, that's a lie, because every indication is the 1.7 billion in cash was sent straight to North Korea, where they are simply continuing the Iranian nuclear program for them.
[03:12:21.748 --> 03:12:25.031]  And of course, finally, he said, I put 20 million people on health care.
[03:12:25.391 --> 03:12:27.513]  Well, most of them were kicked off of health care.
[03:12:27.993 --> 03:12:31.616]  So Obama's candidacy was based on a lie.
[03:12:33.317 --> 03:12:37.739]  Personal background was, my father's a goat herder from Kenya, I'm going to bring us all together.
[03:12:37.759 --> 03:12:41.100]  And then his agenda was, I'm going to cut the deficit in half.
[03:12:41.901 --> 03:12:43.401]  Marriage is between a man and a woman.
[03:12:43.841 --> 03:12:45.562]  It was all intentional deception.
[03:12:45.622 --> 03:12:47.543]  He never intended to do any of that agenda.
[03:12:48.323 --> 03:12:57.538]  And as I showed in my film, Dreams from My Real Father, his background was that his biological father, who became his ideological mentor, was not the Kenyan Obama.
[03:12:57.618 --> 03:13:03.267]  It was, in fact, the Soviet agent, Frank Marshall Davis, who radicalized Obama in his youth.
[03:13:04.096 --> 03:13:22.051]  Now this, Joel, is an area where you and Sidney Blumenthal are in agreement, because as you probably know, the Clinton hitman Blumenthal tried to get that rumor, that assertion, going early in the Democratic toss-up between Hillary and Obama.
[03:13:22.612 --> 03:13:26.836]  It is but one of the reasons that Barack Obama despises him.
[03:13:26.916 --> 03:13:29.077]  It is one of the reasons why Obama ordered that
[03:13:29.838 --> 03:13:47.882]  Even while Hillary was Secretary of State, she could not bring Sidney Blumenthal, son of the anti-Zionist, anti-Jewish radical Max Blumenthal, into the White House, which is why we found him on the payroll at the Clinton Foundation.
[03:13:48.422 --> 03:13:53.903]  Now, I didn't know tax-free foundations could pay for dirty tricks, but evidently they can.
[03:13:55.163 --> 03:13:59.284]  I am really of the view that with Hillary now defeated,
[03:14:00.779 --> 03:14:14.330]  There being no love lost between Obama and the Clintons anyway, Obama clearly remembering when Bill Clinton told Senator Ted Kennedy a few years ago, Ted, this boy would be fetching our coffee.
[03:14:17.156 --> 03:14:27.985]  Nonetheless, I think the Clintons and the Bushes, pardon me, the Clintons and the Obamas had so much on each other that the perfunctory support he gave Hillary was necessary.
[03:14:28.526 --> 03:14:33.330]  With Hillary out of the way, Joel, Obama is the titular head of the Democratic Party.
[03:14:33.950 --> 03:14:37.153]  Michelle is certainly young enough to run for public office.
[03:14:37.973 --> 03:14:40.856]  Are they secretly planning a comeback?
[03:14:41.196 --> 03:14:43.178]  A restoration, as it were?
[03:14:45.221 --> 03:14:46.962]  I think we have to be very concerned.
[03:14:47.002 --> 03:14:49.682]  I think Obama remains dangerous.
[03:14:51.023 --> 03:14:54.543]  He was a professional agitator, trained for 10 years.
[03:14:54.583 --> 03:14:55.904]  He was a trainer for Acorn.
[03:14:56.364 --> 03:15:05.546]  I think he was never interested in being president or the presidency and that's why he went on all these golf vacations, never attended his security briefings, put his feet up on the desk.
[03:15:06.326 --> 03:15:11.471]  Because he wanted to use the presidency to agitate, not to be president or governor.
[03:15:11.971 --> 03:15:15.654]  And that's what he's done all these years in office, is agitate and divide the country.
[03:15:16.115 --> 03:15:18.437]  So I expect Obama to go back to being who he is.
[03:15:19.337 --> 03:15:25.583]  And his Bonnie and Clyde partner in crime is Michelle Obama, who herself was a radical activist.
[03:15:26.083 --> 03:15:30.727]  A lot of people don't know she grew up in Jesse Jackson's household, good friend of Santita Jackson.
[03:15:31.528 --> 03:15:33.149]  And she was also radicalized.
[03:15:33.169 --> 03:15:44.173]  This is why these two together represent a formidable, stealth, radical couple that pretend to wave the flag and love America.
[03:15:44.213 --> 03:15:46.274]  As I show in my film, there's no place like Utopia.
[03:15:46.694 --> 03:15:48.775]  But they do have a hidden radical agenda.
[03:15:49.795 --> 03:15:55.060]  That they learned from, you know, Bill Ayers and the Marxist terrorist gang that taught them.
[03:15:55.100 --> 03:15:57.782]  Bernadine Dorn knew Michelle Obama.
[03:15:57.802 --> 03:15:59.944]  They all worked in the same law firm, Sidley Austin.
[03:16:00.584 --> 03:16:04.688]  So that's how, really, American socialism and communism changed from the late 60s.
[03:16:05.208 --> 03:16:07.790]  They look people in the eye and say, we're going to destroy America.
[03:16:07.831 --> 03:16:10.092]  We're going to blow up buildings and murder policemen.
[03:16:10.713 --> 03:16:12.835]  And we're going to have this wonderful communist revolution.
[03:16:13.535 --> 03:16:14.796]  It was so evil, it failed.
[03:16:14.816 --> 03:16:15.737]  They all went to jail.
[03:16:16.458 --> 03:16:17.259]  When they came out of
[03:16:18.356 --> 03:16:27.179]  Prison or the underground in the early 80s, they taught Obama and the other radicals, look people in the eye but don't tell them about your socialism and Marxism.
[03:16:27.519 --> 03:16:29.060]  Tell them you want to help families.
[03:16:29.140 --> 03:16:31.800]  Tell them you want to give them higher wages and free healthcare.
[03:16:33.081 --> 03:16:40.103]  Use their discontent to take power and then throw them under the bus and pursue the radical agenda that no one voted for.
[03:16:40.663 --> 03:16:45.425]  And that's the story of how American socialism evolved and that's how they got into power.
[03:16:47.161 --> 03:16:49.702]  Joel, before we go, I want to compliment you.
[03:16:49.902 --> 03:17:06.187]  Your incredible short documentary, Banished, the true story of Danny Williams, the abandoned son of Bill Clinton, banished by Hillary, now, it's clear, got almost 36 million opens on the Internet.
[03:17:06.987 --> 03:17:11.729]  Looks like close to 12 million on several platforms and Facebook alone.
[03:17:12.669 --> 03:17:15.251]  This is an enormous accomplishment.
[03:17:16.111 --> 03:17:33.083]  I know for a certainty that millions of minority voters, African American voters, became familiar with the Danny Williams story and bypassed the main media so they could hear the facts presented for themselves and make up their own mind.
[03:17:33.883 --> 03:17:45.112]  Well, Megyn Kelly and others like Olivia Nuzzi of the Daily Beast were trying to tell us, oh no, this is a hoax, this is not true.
[03:17:45.653 --> 03:17:48.735]  It is neither a hoax nor is it untrue.
[03:17:49.256 --> 03:17:53.619]  What kind of people abandon their flesh and blood son?
[03:17:54.020 --> 03:17:54.961]  What kind of people?
[03:17:55.101 --> 03:17:56.882]  So, my hat is off to you.
[03:17:57.383 --> 03:17:58.524]  It's a powerful film.
[03:17:59.124 --> 03:18:13.649]  For those who have not seen it, go online, banish the Danny Williams story, the handiwork of Hollywood filmmaker and conservative activist and foreign policy expert, Joel Gilbert, who joins us today.
[03:18:14.190 --> 03:18:19.832]  Let me take one second now, because we do have to keep the InfoWars ship moving forward.
[03:18:20.292 --> 03:18:21.552]  I met a number of people in
[03:18:24.639 --> 03:18:34.106]  Washington for the inauguration, who had purchased the tactical nanotechnology body armor, now on sale at the InfoWars store.
[03:18:34.586 --> 03:18:35.847]  This is the real deal.
[03:18:36.127 --> 03:18:49.517]  Whether you're a hunter or a sportsman, or you want it for your safety when you go to public events, this is the very best body armor, light body armor you can purchase.
[03:18:50.377 --> 03:19:02.407]  The folks at Infowars don't put their name on something, they won't market it, unless it's exhaustively tested and determined to be the very best, technically, the best value for the money.
[03:19:02.967 --> 03:19:06.971]  So with the kind of violent tactics that we have seen from the left,
[03:19:07.651 --> 03:19:16.561]  Frankly, activists who are pro-liberty, pro-freedom, they need this kind of body armor going forward.
[03:19:17.041 --> 03:19:18.443]  Joel, I recommend it for you.
[03:19:18.463 --> 03:19:21.146]  I have more enemies than anybody you can name.
[03:19:21.226 --> 03:19:22.747]  I probably need to buy some myself.
[03:19:23.308 --> 03:19:29.270]  But this is among the very best products that is brought to you on the InfoWars site.
[03:19:29.370 --> 03:19:46.674]  Now, when you buy things at the InfoWars store, it's not just that you get great pre-tested products with thousands of testimonials, but it is also you're helping fund the Trump revolution and the resistance here at InfoWars.
[03:19:46.714 --> 03:19:47.695]  Thank you, Joel Gilbert.
[03:19:48.035 --> 03:19:48.835]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:03.602 --> 03:20:08.424]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[03:20:08.544 --> 03:20:15.628]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[03:20:15.868 --> 03:20:18.269]  I started to exercise really hard again.
[03:20:18.709 --> 03:20:24.334]  And I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[03:20:24.874 --> 03:20:35.283]  But when I started working with Dr. Group and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[03:20:35.404 --> 03:20:35.664]  Boom!
[03:20:36.084 --> 03:20:39.527]  Weight started pouring off, toxins started coming out of my body.
[03:20:39.987 --> 03:20:41.168]  Then, by early 2016,
[03:20:43.210 --> 03:20:46.552]  I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my 20s.
[03:20:46.592 --> 03:20:47.653]  But the election heated up.
[03:20:47.693 --> 03:20:50.054]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[03:20:50.194 --> 03:20:59.439]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[03:20:59.659 --> 03:21:00.600]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[03:21:00.800 --> 03:21:04.482]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[03:21:05.282 --> 03:21:11.346]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again, and I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[03:21:11.386 --> 03:21:12.727]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[03:21:12.787 --> 03:21:16.330]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[03:21:18.191 --> 03:21:24.958]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[03:21:25.338 --> 03:21:31.825]  I've lost five pounds religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[03:21:32.205 --> 03:21:32.726]  It's amazing.
[03:21:33.026 --> 03:21:35.409]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[03:21:35.689 --> 03:21:38.352]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:21:42.059 --> 03:21:42.680]  Well, here we are.
[03:21:42.720 --> 03:21:43.800]  Another week has passed.
[03:21:44.401 --> 03:21:56.490]  If memory serves, I lost 5 pounds the first week, 3 pounds the next, and only 1 pound this week because it's the holidays, there's fudge, there's candy, it's everywhere, and I've been picking out eggnog, you name it.
[03:21:56.530 --> 03:21:58.472]  This is the worst time of year, but usually you're gaining weight.
[03:21:58.952 --> 03:21:59.873]  I've lost a pound.
[03:22:00.373 --> 03:22:01.434]  So we're now up to 9 pounds.
[03:22:02.884 --> 03:22:07.069]  And I've only got, you know, a week and a half left or so until we see what happens with this experiment.
[03:22:07.089 --> 03:22:08.711]  But I'm pretty happy with 9 pounds.
[03:22:08.751 --> 03:22:10.813]  But I want to lose 5 or 6 more.
[03:22:11.654 --> 03:22:16.339]  But as I said, I'm working out less, I'm eating more, I'm taking the supplements, I'm losing weight.
[03:22:16.880 --> 03:22:19.343]  Whatever is doing to me metabolically is amazing.
[03:22:19.463 --> 03:22:21.005]  Let's see what happens next week.
[03:22:24.977 --> 03:22:27.178]  Well, this is the final update on our little experiment.
[03:22:27.198 --> 03:22:32.061]  I started out in early December, and indeed, I pigged out over Christmas even more than usual.
[03:22:32.781 --> 03:22:37.283]  I did have better, more intense workouts because of Supermail, and just what it does to my mental picture.
[03:22:37.343 --> 03:22:45.928]  But taking the entire family of InfoWars live products, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion Fruit Punch Multivitamin, all of it with the amino acids,
[03:22:46.308 --> 03:22:46.808]  We're good to go.
[03:23:06.425 --> 03:23:13.107]  I ate almost an entire pie that my mother had brought over, a pumpkin pie, and the day before that had three pieces of cherry pie.
[03:23:13.727 --> 03:23:26.971]  I'm not a big sweets person, but around the holidays, fudge, you know how it is folks, hot cocoa, it's just, since I was a kid, the only time I tend to eat a lot of sweets is maybe at birthday parties or around Christmas, and I just picked out this year.
[03:23:27.471 --> 03:23:29.012]  In fact, I was going to stop the experiment.
[03:23:29.032 --> 03:23:30.252]  I thought, well, this just isn't fair.
[03:23:30.272 --> 03:23:32.733]  I mean, I'm eating way more and working out less.
[03:23:33.693 --> 03:23:37.555]  This isn't going to happen, but we went ahead and did the experiment and I still lost some weight.
[03:23:38.195 --> 03:23:54.643]  It wasn't as much as I'd wanted to, but to me it proves the fact that again, metabolically, the things that God's given us through nature and having the good halogen and all the other things that are in the products in me helped me just lose weight while I was actually eating more.
[03:23:55.103 --> 03:23:55.803]  It's hard to believe.
[03:23:56.163 --> 03:23:58.545]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[03:23:58.825 --> 03:24:01.506]  Go read the five star reviews for yourself.
[03:24:16.238 --> 03:24:17.939]  So welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:24:18.039 --> 03:24:22.722]  I'm Roger Stone sitting in for Alex Jones and just happy to be alive.
[03:24:22.742 --> 03:24:37.990]  Again, thank you to the many InfoWars listeners and viewers who extended their best wishes for a speedy recover after my recent tangle with some poison, most likely polonium, in the ongoing struggle
[03:24:39.090 --> 03:24:46.954]  By the deep state to claim that Donald Trump's election was rigged by the Russians, that hacked by the Russians.
[03:24:47.654 --> 03:24:58.600]  The New York Times last week said on page one that Paul Manafort and Roger Stone were under investigation for their emails and financial transactions with the Russians.
[03:24:59.340 --> 03:25:01.021]  I had dinner with Manafort last week.
[03:25:01.912 --> 03:25:02.973]  And he agrees with me.
[03:25:03.613 --> 03:25:04.334]  It's a lie.
[03:25:05.074 --> 03:25:06.836]  There is no there, there.
[03:25:07.336 --> 03:25:09.778]  There are no such contacts.
[03:25:10.759 --> 03:25:21.527]  I'm very excited about the man who, pardon me, our upcoming book, The Making of the President 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated a revolution.
[03:25:22.147 --> 03:25:25.290]  Now, I can tell you right now who the heroes of this book are.
[03:25:26.431 --> 03:25:29.033]  Matt Drudge is one of the heroes of this book.
[03:25:29.961 --> 03:25:34.204]  Alex Jones is one of the heroes of this book.
[03:25:35.064 --> 03:25:38.486]  Stephen K. Bannon is one of the heroes of this book.
[03:25:39.587 --> 03:25:47.012]  One of the real heroes of this book is someone I like very much, somebody who is a Donald Trump loyalist.
[03:25:48.021 --> 03:26:04.226]  Someone who is tough and feisty and enormously capable and I think came to the Trump campaign at a key time where she made an indelible and important contribution and that is Kellyanne Conway.
[03:26:05.546 --> 03:26:10.188]  Kellyanne Conway spent some years in the vineyards as a
[03:26:11.055 --> 03:26:18.056]  Republican pollster with an expertise in women's voters, but not limited to that.
[03:26:18.936 --> 03:26:28.678]  I thought that she was a great asset for the campaign when she joined because she has an aggressive yet easy manner on television.
[03:26:29.718 --> 03:26:38.600]  And because today, within the confines of the Trump White House, she is among those looking out for the Trump revolution.
[03:26:39.520 --> 03:26:42.724]  She's among those who knows how Trump got elected.
[03:26:43.424 --> 03:26:50.972]  She's among those who understand the fragile but important constituency that Donald Trump has put together.
[03:26:52.014 --> 03:26:56.699]  Now, more recently come reports, only yesterday, unconfirmed,
[03:26:57.637 --> 03:27:12.071]  That Kellyanne may have decked a guy who was a friend of hers when she stepped between two of her friends in a fistfight altercation and her only option to break it up was to throw a punch of her own.
[03:27:13.133 --> 03:27:14.514]  This, I hope, is true.
[03:27:15.435 --> 03:27:19.058]  This makes me like Kellyanne Conway even more.
[03:27:20.003 --> 03:27:33.052]  I like tough, feisty, decisive, opinionated women, particularly those who are absolutely dedicated to protecting Donald Trump and the Trump revolution.
[03:27:34.593 --> 03:27:44.620]  Now last night, I was at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts to see the pathetic performance of CNN talking head Ana Navarro.
[03:27:45.902 --> 03:27:53.605]  Now, as I said here last week, Navarro was fired by Governor Jeb Bush because she got caught lying about being an attorney.
[03:27:54.326 --> 03:27:59.628]  She accepted a position in his administration by claiming to be a lawyer.
[03:28:00.208 --> 03:28:01.129]  She is not a lawyer.
[03:28:02.169 --> 03:28:08.232]  So the question you must ask yourself is why would CNN hire someone like this as an expert?
[03:28:09.383 --> 03:28:20.087]  Navarro has never actually run a campaign or had a serious role in a campaign for any Republican candidate, for any office, where she has had an impact.
[03:28:20.807 --> 03:28:26.870]  So she has no qualifications and no expertise, and she has a shady background.
[03:28:28.030 --> 03:28:30.631]  Why are they not upset about this at CNN?
[03:28:30.671 --> 03:28:31.451]  It's very simple.
[03:28:32.232 --> 03:28:35.053]  Because CNN is fake news.
[03:28:36.053 --> 03:28:37.594]  Fake Republican strategist.
[03:28:38.522 --> 03:28:41.545]  Fake background, fake opinions.
[03:28:42.425 --> 03:28:49.811]  So this truck was driven around the perimeter of the Performing Arts Center.
[03:28:50.011 --> 03:28:56.276]  Local activists handed out a flyer illuminating people as to Navarro's true background.
[03:28:57.182 --> 03:29:18.589]  And then who can forget her epic meltdown on air, screaming, pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy at the top of her lungs, literally losing it, forcing CNN to cut to break, and then forcing CNN to later remove this footage from the air so we couldn't see this mental
[03:29:19.409 --> 03:29:23.490]  Breakdown by a lunatic, by a hater.
[03:29:24.251 --> 03:29:26.931]  So, last night it was fun calling out Ana Navarro.
[03:29:27.372 --> 03:29:34.734]  We'll be right back on InfoWars with more on the struggle to make America great again and the role we need you to play in it.
[03:29:52.459 --> 03:29:55.480]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.380 --> 03:29:59.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.381 --> 03:30:09.563]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[03:30:10.103 --> 03:30:11.563]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[03:30:12.423 --> 03:30:14.344]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[03:30:14.904 --> 03:30:20.425]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[03:30:21.045 --> 03:30:21.706]  Of course!
[03:30:39.845 --> 03:30:49.310]  Straight from the factory, however you want it, it is shipped on the next business day to you and your family, and a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[03:30:49.550 --> 03:30:50.310]  You cannot lose.
[03:30:50.350 --> 03:30:51.451]  You're funding the Infowar.
[03:30:51.751 --> 03:30:58.495]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[03:30:58.835 --> 03:31:02.757]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[03:31:03.397 --> 03:31:18.908]  President Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, continued his war against the establishment media yesterday, suggesting that there is a default position amongst biased reporters to assume that the new administration is lying.
[03:31:19.048 --> 03:31:26.373]  And I think that what has happened is that there's this predisposition in the media to, especially with this president,
[03:31:26.693 --> 03:31:30.834]  And I think this idea that we're immediately lying because where are their facts?
[03:31:31.255 --> 03:31:37.016]  Because I got called a liar for something that I can add up and say, here's how we come up with this number.
[03:31:37.176 --> 03:31:45.579]  Meanwhile, over at MSNBC, Chris Matthews continued to openly compare President Donald Trump to murderous dictators.
[03:31:46.039 --> 03:31:47.980]  You're misusing your office thoroughly.
[03:31:48.380 --> 03:31:50.761]  You know, it gets to be like Kim Jong-un.
[03:31:51.101 --> 03:31:52.542]  But who's gonna mess with the son-in-law?
[03:31:52.642 --> 03:31:55.183]  Look, at the end of the day, that's the line.
[03:31:55.303 --> 03:31:55.824]  That's the line.
[03:31:55.904 --> 03:31:58.145]  Proximity, proximity, proximity.
[03:31:58.305 --> 03:32:01.467]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com
[03:32:12.944 --> 03:32:20.854]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:20.914 --> 03:32:24.018]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[03:32:24.827 --> 03:32:26.648]  And they're also very affordable.
[03:32:26.668 --> 03:32:26.988]  Exactly.
[03:32:27.008 --> 03:32:28.788]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[03:32:28.828 --> 03:32:32.149]  You talk about... We're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[03:32:32.189 --> 03:32:33.330]  We've both talked to them.
[03:32:33.650 --> 03:32:42.633]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[03:32:43.493 --> 03:32:44.594]  We refuse to screw people.
[03:32:44.934 --> 03:32:45.914]  We refuse to do that.
[03:32:46.294 --> 03:32:48.255]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[03:32:48.815 --> 03:32:55.543]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[03:32:55.944 --> 03:32:56.705]  It's a win-win.
[03:32:57.186 --> 03:32:57.946]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:33:15.040 --> 03:33:20.042]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[03:33:20.563 --> 03:33:23.224]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.628 --> 03:33:33.068]  Thank you.
[03:33:33.629 --> 03:33:35.410]  Welcome back to Info Wars.
[03:33:35.470 --> 03:33:50.019]  I'm sitting in for the great Alex Jones and privileged to follow Paul Joseph Watson, who is always illuminating the latest scheme of the globalists for us from his perch in the UK.
[03:33:51.795 --> 03:33:58.518]  I went to the Infowars.com store recently to try to get some more DNA force.
[03:33:59.378 --> 03:34:13.564]  I think this product did an incredible job of torquing up my immunity and helping me repel the antioxidants and other poisons you're getting naturally, never mind those that you may be getting exogenously.
[03:34:14.465 --> 03:34:15.125]  And they were out.
[03:34:16.085 --> 03:34:17.726]  And I will tell you, I was disappointed.
[03:34:17.806 --> 03:34:19.667]  Fortunately, I had a small supply left.
[03:34:20.648 --> 03:34:28.281]  And now comes word that they have gotten a small catch of DNA force and it is back in stock.
[03:34:29.238 --> 03:34:31.580]  And you can get it at a 10% discount.
[03:34:31.680 --> 03:34:35.582]  So, I really credit this product for helping save my life.
[03:34:37.003 --> 03:34:44.709]  I don't care if some on the left, David Brock and his other panty-wearing misfits, say that this is quackery.
[03:34:44.829 --> 03:34:45.929]  It is not quackery.
[03:34:46.690 --> 03:34:51.193]  Herbs and other natural substances have been used by man for 2,000 years.
[03:34:53.035 --> 03:35:09.211]  Quackery is what's practiced by the giant pharmaceutical companies who want to solve everything with drugs, with foreign substances, as opposed to a natural approach, which has worked for me my entire life.
[03:35:09.912 --> 03:35:19.681]  The products at the Infowars.com store are the very best, particularly the herbs and other natural products that'll keep you in good health.
[03:35:20.201 --> 03:35:22.283]  So help us fight the revolution.
[03:35:22.343 --> 03:35:30.371]  Help us fund this important beacon of free speech by going to Infowars.com right now.
[03:35:32.441 --> 03:35:45.808]  I am, uh, was one thing that did disappoint me about the inaugural where I had a terrific time, but anybody who knows me knows that I am a stickler for the etiquette of men's dressing.
[03:35:46.108 --> 03:36:01.316]  Now, the men's etiquette books and all rules regarding the presidential swearing in and inauguration dictate that the president and his immediate party would wear what you call a mourning suit.
[03:36:03.076 --> 03:36:08.579]  And that's what I wore, a morning suit, because that is the correct outfit.
[03:36:08.619 --> 03:36:10.440]  There I am with Mrs. Stone.
[03:36:11.661 --> 03:36:23.388]  And this is a swallowtail coat, a gray vest, a four-in-hand tie, a watch chain, and obviously, as you can see, the de rigueur top hat.
[03:36:24.335 --> 03:36:26.275]  Ron, this is what Ronald Reagan wore.
[03:36:26.736 --> 03:36:29.356]  This is what John Kennedy wore.
[03:36:29.836 --> 03:36:34.197]  This is what every president up until George Bush wore.
[03:36:34.898 --> 03:36:43.880]  George Bush chose to wear a business suit and a somber tie, a tradition that Donald Trump decided to continue.
[03:36:44.580 --> 03:36:48.141]  Then for the inaugural balls, black tie is not correct.
[03:36:48.441 --> 03:36:52.522]  White tie and tails is what is correct.
[03:36:52.983 --> 03:36:58.264]  So for the inaugural ball, I, of course, switched into white tie and tails.
[03:36:59.264 --> 03:37:04.046]  It is literally impossible for any man to look bad in this outfit.
[03:37:04.586 --> 03:37:08.327]  It is literally impossible not to look dashing.
[03:37:09.007 --> 03:37:13.449]  So I understand Donald Trump and he does it his way.
[03:37:14.400 --> 03:37:20.563]  And I gotta tell you, I love the fact that he wore the New York red power tie.
[03:37:21.324 --> 03:37:24.806]  He is the progenitor of the power tie.
[03:37:25.846 --> 03:37:26.627]  And it was strong.
[03:37:27.571 --> 03:37:32.155]  But because I'm sentimental, you know, I kind of I miss the old days.
[03:37:32.816 --> 03:37:36.780]  The striped trousers, the the frock coat, the top hat.
[03:37:37.801 --> 03:37:43.026]  It's a certain elegance that you saw in the members of Congress and those in the inaugural party.
[03:37:43.106 --> 03:37:49.612]  But once again, Donald Trump has changed many things, including the etiquette of the inauguration.
[03:37:50.333 --> 03:37:51.714]  This was an amazing
[03:37:52.615 --> 03:37:54.737]  Uplifting experience.
[03:37:55.937 --> 03:38:00.640]  I was fortunate enough to be seated with Alex Jones, although he couldn't stay seated for long.
[03:38:00.681 --> 03:38:02.182]  He was so excited.
[03:38:03.262 --> 03:38:07.285]  And it was not a country club Republican crowd.
[03:38:07.785 --> 03:38:15.971]  The people sitting in my row were working class people, some of them African-Americans, and they were applauding lustily our new president.
[03:38:17.534 --> 03:38:20.396]  There were people as far as the eye can see.
[03:38:21.157 --> 03:38:30.744]  So I reject the idea that this was not as well attended or not better attended than Barack Obama's inaugural.
[03:38:31.424 --> 03:38:38.929]  I'm not sure it's that important other than to say that throughout this campaign, Donald Trump has set records in terms of crowds.
[03:38:39.770 --> 03:38:54.040]  This was one of the early warnings that he was on a trajectory for victory that the mainstream media chose to lose, chose to ignore, chose to undercut.
[03:38:54.820 --> 03:38:57.903]  And they did so at their own peril.
[03:39:00.765 --> 03:39:05.108]  We are now going to turn our attention, I believe, to the basics.
[03:39:06.030 --> 03:39:10.492]  So what you've seen in the last two weeks is that Trump is doing the big things and the small things.
[03:39:11.092 --> 03:39:25.737]  Keeping faith on TPP, withdrawing us, signing executive orders, ushering Obamacare towards the exit, keeping faith with the American people, and doing precisely the things he said he would do.
[03:39:26.778 --> 03:39:32.040]  At the same time, yes, he's getting into these little squabbles with the media when they lie.
[03:39:33.154 --> 03:39:35.037]  This is the nature of Donald Trump.
[03:39:35.178 --> 03:39:36.019]  He's a fighter.
[03:39:36.440 --> 03:39:37.321]  He's combative.
[03:39:37.862 --> 03:39:43.813]  No one will take advantage of him and no one will take advantage of the United States as long as he is president.
[03:39:44.554 --> 03:39:53.699]  And frankly, no one will care about these inside the beltway squabbles with the fake news media.
[03:39:54.339 --> 03:40:13.349]  If he's producing jobs, if he's producing revitalization of our economy, if he is fixing our immigration system, if he is renegotiating these trade deals, then he has the capacity to be among our very, very greatest presidents.
[03:40:14.847 --> 03:40:16.768]  So I am optimistic.
[03:40:17.669 --> 03:40:35.199]  I'm always cautiously concerned about whether or not the incursion of mainstream Republicans, the incursion of establishment Republicans into the administration makes the president's goal harder.
[03:40:36.200 --> 03:40:37.321]  He needs men and women.
[03:40:38.186 --> 03:40:50.747]  Who are for his vision, for his mission, not Republican turncoats who suddenly show up and say, oh, Mr. President, I was for you the whole time.
[03:40:51.889 --> 03:40:52.530]  Sure they were.
[03:40:54.747 --> 03:41:21.703]  I have no doubt whatsoever that the same neocon, never-Trump Republicans, who financed and who brought out the so-called NBC Billy Bush tape, are the same people behind this fabricated memo, pushed by the CIA, shown to President Obama, shown to President-elect Trump, leaked to the media, first to BuzzFeed, and then picked up by CNN.
[03:41:23.459 --> 03:41:26.161]  Just to remind you, CNN is not a news organization.
[03:41:26.761 --> 03:41:30.784]  It's a radical propaganda arm of the Soros operation.
[03:41:31.485 --> 03:41:33.546]  They have no regard there for facts.
[03:41:34.367 --> 03:41:37.709]  They have no regard for fair play or journalistic ethics.
[03:41:38.590 --> 03:41:52.620]  Back during the primaries, they allowed Ted Cruz to come on the air in real time, in prime time, and make accusations about me and Donald Trump without ever affording me the opportunity to respond
[03:41:53.362 --> 03:41:53.862]  To those.
[03:41:54.923 --> 03:42:02.929]  CBS, to their credit, when Cruz went crazy, at least sent a camera to me to allow me to record my reaction.
[03:42:03.370 --> 03:42:04.971]  And then they aired both.
[03:42:05.972 --> 03:42:07.793]  That's what news organizations do.
[03:42:08.694 --> 03:42:18.201]  But every attempt to contact the producers at CNN, to ask for equal time, to ask for equal treatment, even recently when
[03:42:19.631 --> 03:42:33.395]  John Podesta again falsely went on CNN after the election and claimed that Stone knew everything about the Russian hacking and he tipped off his friend Trump for the nine millionth time.
[03:42:34.415 --> 03:42:35.395]  That is false.
[03:42:36.276 --> 03:42:37.636]  That is not true.
[03:42:38.356 --> 03:42:41.097]  There is no evidence to support that claim.
[03:42:42.217 --> 03:42:47.699]  And CNN is irresponsible to not allow me to come on
[03:42:48.740 --> 03:42:51.262]  And make my case regarding the facts.
[03:42:52.543 --> 03:42:56.827]  I've been talking to Alex Jones about a march on CNN when it gets a bit warmer.
[03:42:57.708 --> 03:42:59.209]  I think this is a requirement.
[03:43:00.070 --> 03:43:15.803]  I think it's very important that thousands and thousands of freedom fighters, of average citizens, show up for a peaceful protest at the Time Warner Center, where CNN has their international headquarters.
[03:43:16.684 --> 03:43:18.585]  Stay tuned for our plans about that.
[03:43:18.686 --> 03:43:32.295]  It's a little chilly right now, but I think a mass demonstration against fake news outside the CNN building, who knows, maybe we can catch a glimpse of Anderson Cooper.
[03:43:33.016 --> 03:43:34.757]  Wouldn't that be sweet?
[03:43:35.438 --> 03:43:44.264]  So, I think it is important that people recognize, and this is one of the key points of my book, The Making of the President 2016,
[03:43:46.232 --> 03:43:47.753]  Is we've reached the tipping point.
[03:43:48.974 --> 03:43:59.624]  The mainstream media, the ABCs, the NBCs, the CBSes, CNN and Fox, they have lost their monopoly on dissemination of political information.
[03:44:01.005 --> 03:44:03.607]  When they had the monopoly, they destroyed Barry Goldwater.
[03:44:04.929 --> 03:44:06.310]  He's a trigger-happy nut.
[03:44:06.470 --> 03:44:07.351]  He's a lunatic.
[03:44:08.151 --> 03:44:09.373]  He's an anti-Semite.
[03:44:09.393 --> 03:44:10.534]  He's a neo-Nazi.
[03:44:11.014 --> 03:44:12.655]  None of those things, of course, were true.
[03:44:13.544 --> 03:44:16.427]  They tried the same act on Donald Trump.
[03:44:17.428 --> 03:44:18.069]  It didn't work.
[03:44:19.030 --> 03:44:24.897]  That's because less than 50% of the voters are now getting their distorted information.
[03:44:25.758 --> 03:44:33.727]  And more and more voters, for technological reasons, are getting their political news on their handheld device.
[03:44:35.080 --> 03:44:50.762]  That means that they have a greater series of choices, whether it's InfoWars.com, whether it's Breitbart, whether it's The Daily Caller, whether it's Town Hall, whether it's Lou Rockwell, and dozens of other free-thinking sites.
[03:44:51.789 --> 03:45:03.522]  And in the case of Breitbart or InfoWars, where superior investigative journalism based on facts and truth is being practiced.
[03:45:04.143 --> 03:45:08.708]  It's not the fake news narrative that is being cooked up.
[03:45:09.875 --> 03:45:16.197]  By the mainstream media and their multinational corporate owners.
[03:45:17.197 --> 03:45:21.938]  That is the single most significant shift in American politics.
[03:45:22.818 --> 03:45:29.920]  That is what opened the door to the election of President Donald Trump.
[03:45:31.981 --> 03:45:36.862]  Now, I have said several times that I think the way Trump closed
[03:45:38.086 --> 03:45:51.529]  The way he launched a Herculean physical effort, just sheer determination, and a sprint across the country in the closing days, doing four, five, six speeches a day.
[03:45:52.689 --> 03:45:58.730]  He simply outworked Hillary, who during most of that time was home in her pajamas watching television.
[03:46:00.771 --> 03:46:06.452]  In the end, Trump really stole a page from the book of give him hell Harry Truman.
[03:46:07.469 --> 03:46:10.410]  Who was counted out, like Trump, by the media.
[03:46:10.890 --> 03:46:15.632]  Who the polls showed would lose in 1948 by the media.
[03:46:16.313 --> 03:46:17.973]  Who was considered hopeless.
[03:46:19.234 --> 03:46:25.136]  And Truman decided to jump a train and take it all the way across the country.
[03:46:25.156 --> 03:46:33.400]  And a whistle stop was defined as a town that was so small, you had to blow the whistle before you got there to let people know you were coming.
[03:46:33.880 --> 03:46:35.941]  And that you'd stop if there were passengers.
[03:46:37.028 --> 03:46:42.033]  Truman barnstormed across the country, hammering the Republicans.
[03:46:43.314 --> 03:46:47.297]  Interestingly enough, Hillary Clinton was very much like Tom Dewey.
[03:46:48.238 --> 03:46:48.919]  Complacent.
[03:46:50.000 --> 03:46:51.301]  Thought they had it in the bag.
[03:46:52.462 --> 03:46:52.923]  Arrogant.
[03:46:53.964 --> 03:46:54.444]  Cold.
[03:46:55.205 --> 03:46:55.765]  And aloof.
[03:46:57.427 --> 03:46:59.549]  Dewey avoided putting forward any program.
[03:47:00.765 --> 03:47:08.952]  He had a split Republican Party between the Taft wing and the Dewey wing, the conservative wing and the eastern liberal wing, but everybody told Tom the same thing.
[03:47:09.493 --> 03:47:10.794]  Tom, don't say anything.
[03:47:11.334 --> 03:47:12.215]  Don't rock the boat.
[03:47:12.315 --> 03:47:13.296]  Don't make any enemies.
[03:47:13.336 --> 03:47:14.717]  You've got this in the bag.
[03:47:16.159 --> 03:47:22.004]  The energy was with Truman and not Dewey, just as the energy was with Trump and not Hillary.
[03:47:24.059 --> 03:47:37.226]  One of my favorite anecdotes from this election is Truman in the engine compartment of the train, driving the engineers to break all speed laws to lay on additional stops.
[03:47:38.206 --> 03:47:45.590]  Reminds me of Donald Trump calling in his pilots and saying, I've decided to go to Milwaukee and Detroit and so on.
[03:47:46.571 --> 03:47:52.054]  Both of the men possessed an almost demonic drive for votes in the close.
[03:47:53.015 --> 03:47:56.176]  This can not in any way be underestimated.
[03:47:57.197 --> 03:48:10.503]  So if you want to get the inside story of how that went down and how Donald Trump stole the page from one of our feistiest and I would say most peppery former presidents.
[03:48:10.583 --> 03:48:21.948]  Now, it's a shame that the anti-communism middle class type of Democrat, the Truman, John Kennedy, Henry Jackson school of Democrat no longer
[03:48:22.941 --> 03:48:23.421]  Exists.
[03:48:25.002 --> 03:48:47.555]  But the truth about this election was that in Wisconsin, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and a handful of other states, Donald Trump ran ahead of Mitt Romney and John McCain and George W. Bush when it came to inroads among those white, moderate, Catholic, Democratic votes.
[03:48:48.874 --> 03:48:58.860]  So a shift of 3% among those voters in Western Pennsylvania, for example, is enough to swing this election.
[03:49:00.321 --> 03:49:15.770]  The undervote of African Americans, as we talked about earlier, and the impact of Danny Williams, and the amazing video put together by Joel Gilbert, depressed black turnout in Detroit.
[03:49:16.750 --> 03:49:26.501]  And in Richmond, and in Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and in Milwaukee, and in Philadelphia, and in Cleveland.
[03:49:27.241 --> 03:49:28.002]  No dirty tricks!
[03:49:29.005 --> 03:49:51.779]  What happens when blacks learn the civil rights record of the Clintons and they learn about the abandoned son of Bill Clinton, Danny Williams, who they tried to discredit with a phony non-existent blood test or a blood test that didn't require enough DNA or didn't have enough DNA material to make a determination?
[03:49:52.619 --> 03:49:55.161]  This is perhaps the Clintons' greatest shame.
[03:49:57.364 --> 03:50:01.607]  3% among African Americans, 3% among white Catholic Democrats.
[03:50:01.727 --> 03:50:08.951]  In the end, Donald Trump only carried Michigan by about 10,000 votes.
[03:50:09.792 --> 03:50:12.173]  So, thank you for joining us at InfoWars.

[03:50:43.231 --> 03:50:44.012]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:51:07.418 --> 03:51:13.021]  Roger Stone cutting the bureaucracy 75% that they admit is not to keep the earth clean.
[03:51:13.061 --> 03:51:15.883]  It's meant to hurt our industry and shut us down.
[03:51:16.423 --> 03:51:18.164]  He's just delivering on every front.
[03:51:18.784 --> 03:51:19.184]  He said it.
[03:51:19.525 --> 03:51:20.665]  He's not, he got his hair cut.
[03:51:20.685 --> 03:51:21.566]  He's not wearing makeup.
[03:51:21.586 --> 03:51:22.686]  Looks even better today.
[03:51:23.086 --> 03:51:25.868]  I mean, it just gets better and better and better.
[03:51:25.928 --> 03:51:27.569]  He's a tough negotiator.
[03:51:28.049 --> 03:51:34.853]  We need some tough negotiations with Vladimir Putin and the Russians so that we might have peace.
[03:51:35.473 --> 03:51:36.894]  Peace is the objective.
[03:51:36.994 --> 03:51:39.194]  This isn't about how you get along with Putin.
[03:51:39.594 --> 03:51:41.595]  It's about peace.
[03:51:41.895 --> 03:51:54.519]  And what you're seeing, both in the demonstrations, Alex, and in the constant campaign to undermine Trump, is that the deep state just cannot accept his election.
[03:51:54.539 --> 03:51:55.560]  You talk about the atomic fever.
[03:51:56.060 --> 03:51:57.220]  I saw the arrogance of these people.
[03:51:57.480 --> 03:51:58.681]  Why are they so mentally ill?
[03:52:00.097 --> 03:52:02.899]  Well, because they've been running things for 30 years.
[03:52:03.399 --> 03:52:05.621]  Everything has been done the neocon way.
[03:52:06.181 --> 03:52:13.467]  The Bush-Clinton-Bush-Obama combine has run the country into the ditch, but they are used to having their way.
[03:52:13.927 --> 03:52:21.232]  Now, along comes this upstart, this reformer, Donald Trump, with his own ideas, and you can't bully him.
[03:52:22.093 --> 03:52:23.314]  And you can't buy him.
[03:52:23.354 --> 03:52:26.096]  See, the Saudis are very adept at buying people.
[03:52:26.796 --> 03:52:29.077]  They buy their way through Washington.
[03:52:29.177 --> 03:52:33.199]  All the special interests buy their way through Washington.
[03:52:33.219 --> 03:52:35.020]  And Trump just doesn't play that game.
[03:52:35.480 --> 03:52:37.121]  So there is a panic.
[03:52:37.441 --> 03:52:41.243]  What do you make of coming in and delivering 75% cut in regulations?
[03:52:41.823 --> 03:52:45.765]  Well, meanwhile, Trump is working the phones with some of these big companies like LBJ.
[03:52:46.645 --> 03:52:56.451]  He is wheedling, and coddling, and coaxing, and talking, negotiating, and pushing, and probably threatening people in these big companies to stay in the United States.
[03:52:56.471 --> 03:52:57.432]  Well, he threatened them on air.
[03:52:57.472 --> 03:52:59.353]  He said, you're not bringing your crap back in here if you leave.
[03:53:00.053 --> 03:53:01.094]  It's called leadership.
[03:53:01.794 --> 03:53:02.775]  It's what we've lacked.
[03:53:03.035 --> 03:53:05.656]  He's going to renegotiate these massive trade deals.
[03:53:06.117 --> 03:53:10.299]  The Mexicans and the Canadians have already indicated they're ready to enter those talks.
[03:53:10.899 --> 03:53:13.721]  This, again, is leadership.
[03:53:13.841 --> 03:53:14.662]  Total delivery.
[03:53:15.322 --> 03:53:19.627]  Hillary Clinton promised the neocons an expansion of the proxy war.
[03:53:20.288 --> 03:53:22.330]  They were prepared to do a no-fly zone.
[03:53:22.791 --> 03:53:25.955]  This is an open invitation for World War III.
[03:53:26.015 --> 03:53:27.456]  And by the way, I want to say something to Ron Paul.
[03:53:27.536 --> 03:53:28.117]  I love Ron Paul.
[03:53:28.137 --> 03:53:28.818]  He's on Wednesday.
[03:53:29.178 --> 03:53:29.819]  He has an article out.
[03:53:29.839 --> 03:53:30.580]  It's on Infowars.com.
[03:53:32.196 --> 03:53:38.939]  Trump's foreign policy and unwise inconsistency, you know, and he's basically saying we can't be for war to take out ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[03:53:39.199 --> 03:53:42.021]  That's the globalist proxy war meant to start war with Russia.
[03:53:42.281 --> 03:53:45.582]  We have to go clean it up or it'll start a war with Russia, Congressman.
[03:53:45.803 --> 03:53:52.646]  And I understand Paul, again, just sticks to it from an absolute blind point of view in that he does what he says he'll do.
[03:53:53.006 --> 03:53:54.066]  No war at any time.
[03:53:54.107 --> 03:53:58.769]  Well, this isn't war if it's cleaning up the neocons and the Democrats trying to start World War III.
[03:54:13.955 --> 03:54:16.856]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:54:16.936 --> 03:54:18.497]  We are the tip of the spear.
[03:54:18.517 --> 03:54:20.338]  This is the resistance.
[03:54:20.978 --> 03:54:27.722]  I still chuckle over the way the mainstream media doesn't understand InfoWars.com or Alex Jones.
[03:54:28.502 --> 03:54:40.091]  And then if you will look at those who are watching online, combine those who are watching on Facebook Live, on YouTube Live, who watch it later in podcast, who are listening on the radio.
[03:54:40.891 --> 03:54:50.379]  Folks here at InfoWars here are amassing enormous numbers of viewers and listeners and enlisting them in the war to make America great again.
[03:54:51.437 --> 03:54:56.140]  If there is an MVP in this last election, it would have to be Alex Jones.
[03:54:56.941 --> 03:54:57.782]  And Matt Drudge.
[03:54:58.502 --> 03:54:59.763]  And Stephen K. Bannon.
[03:55:00.404 --> 03:55:03.726]  And the barons of the alternative media.
[03:55:04.386 --> 03:55:05.527]  The real media.
[03:55:06.808 --> 03:55:11.131]  My friend Matt Boyle, the Bureau Chief at Breitbart in Washington, has this right.
[03:55:12.072 --> 03:55:13.553]  We are the mainstream media.
[03:55:14.314 --> 03:55:15.334]  They are the fringe.
[03:55:16.195 --> 03:55:18.537]  You can tell by the small number that are watching them.
[03:55:19.761 --> 03:55:23.244]  So it's a new day in America.
[03:55:24.524 --> 03:55:26.486]  I am very focused on the U.S.
[03:55:26.526 --> 03:55:27.286]  Supreme Court.
[03:55:28.487 --> 03:55:36.173]  I have made no bones about it that in a perfect world, my choice for the first opening would be Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[03:55:37.708 --> 03:55:40.589]  The legal analyst for Fox News.
[03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:53.413]  Now, Judge Napolitano has been a friend of mine and a mentor since 1981 when he wandered in off the street to help Governor Tom Kaine in a recount.
[03:55:54.393 --> 03:56:00.595]  Kaine had won the 1981 New Jersey election, we claimed, by 1,209 votes out of about 2 million cast.
[03:56:03.483 --> 03:56:14.837]  And there was a recount and a tussle, and it was favorably decided for Governor Tom Kaine, who went on to become one of New Jersey's greatest governors.
[03:56:15.814 --> 03:56:20.277]  And that's how I first met Andrew Napolitano, in the trenches.
[03:56:21.037 --> 03:56:24.119]  He's a first-rate legal mind and a first-rate temperament.
[03:56:24.619 --> 03:56:34.926]  He's a constitutional scholar, was a protege and close friend of Antonin Scalia, perhaps one of our greatest jurists, for the last 10 years of his life.
[03:56:35.526 --> 03:56:39.288]  So in a perfect world, I would prefer Judge Napolitano.
[03:56:40.609 --> 03:56:45.132]  Many people, however, believe the president feels conscripted to stick to a list.
[03:56:46.047 --> 03:56:46.267]  All right.
[03:57:03.020 --> 03:57:05.702]  of Pittsburgh on the appeals court.
[03:57:05.722 --> 03:57:08.004]  I think he would be a solid pick.
[03:57:08.444 --> 03:57:12.446]  He is a young man, serves on the Third Circuit.
[03:57:13.507 --> 03:57:14.168]  I don't think he's 50.
[03:57:15.068 --> 03:57:16.569]  He is a solid conservative.
[03:57:17.670 --> 03:57:20.412]  And that would be a good appointment.
[03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:36.868]  Judge Don Willett, however, of Texas, a real anti-government libertarian, someone who's deeply skeptical of federal power and the consolidation of power by the federal government, would be an excellent choice.
[03:57:37.912 --> 03:57:43.076]  Well, it's a bit of a madman, a revolutionary, just what this stodgy court needs.
[03:57:43.997 --> 03:57:47.039]  So I think the president's got some excellent choices.
[03:57:47.079 --> 03:57:52.944]  They are more in the traditional conservative establishment, conservative mold.
[03:57:53.985 --> 03:58:02.292]  Personally, I'm crossing my fingers, hoping that Judge Napolitano may be Donald Trump's second appointment to the court.
[03:58:03.335 --> 03:58:05.075]  That's my handicapping today.
[03:58:05.315 --> 03:58:10.337]  I think Hardiman is the frontrunner and I think it would be a fine appointment.
[03:58:11.657 --> 03:58:24.339]  If Donald Trump is going to be a transformative president, not a transitional president, but a transformative president, if he's really going to change everything, candidly doesn't need a conservative court or a right-wing court.
[03:58:25.000 --> 03:58:26.040]  He needs a Trump court.
[03:58:27.071 --> 03:58:39.398]  He needs a liberty-based conservative court, but with an eye towards civil liberties, with an eye towards Trump's libertarian cohort within his constituency.
[03:58:40.639 --> 03:58:48.523]  And I hope he will keep this in mind as he makes what could be the first of as many as four decisions.
[03:58:48.603 --> 03:58:50.904]  Let's remember that the Supreme Court...
[03:58:53.018 --> 03:59:08.505]  President Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, continued his war against the establishment media yesterday, suggesting that there is a default position amongst biased reporters to assume that the new administration is lying.
[03:59:08.665 --> 03:59:15.989]  And I think that what has happened is that there's this predisposition in the media to, especially with this president,
[03:59:16.309 --> 03:59:20.452]  And I think this idea that we're immediately lying because where are their facts?
[03:59:20.872 --> 03:59:26.636]  Because I got called a liar for something that I can add up and say, here's how we come up with this number.
[03:59:26.796 --> 03:59:35.181]  Meanwhile, over at MSNBC, Chris Matthews continued to openly compare President Donald Trump to murderous dictators.
[03:59:35.662 --> 03:59:37.603]  You're misusing your office thoroughly.
[03:59:38.023 --> 03:59:40.385]  You know, it gets to be like Kim Jong-un.
[03:59:40.725 --> 03:59:42.186]  But who's gonna mess with the son-in-law?
[03:59:42.206 --> 03:59:44.807]  Look, at the end of the day, that's the line.
[03:59:44.927 --> 03:59:45.467]  That's the line.
[03:59:45.528 --> 03:59:46.308]  Proximity, proximity, proximity.
[03:59:46.328 --> 03:59:48.049]  Although Mussolini executed his son-in-law.
[03:59:48.189 --> 03:59:51.631]  And you can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[03:59:54.012 --> 03:59:59.735]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
