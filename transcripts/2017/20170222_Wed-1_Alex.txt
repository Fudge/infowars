[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.469]  We're good to go.
[00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:40.701]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:53.104]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[00:00:53.124 --> 00:00:58.266]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies.
[00:00:58.286 --> 00:00:59.446]  You can look them up for yourself.
[00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:09.832]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:01:09.972 --> 00:01:16.116]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:18.857]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:01:19.858 --> 00:01:21.059]  People are falling apart.
[00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.119]  They're totally depressed.
[00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.680]  They're unhappy.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.241]  What is going on?
[00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:29.364]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:33.186]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:01:33.546 --> 00:01:35.288]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:01:35.468 --> 00:01:42.456]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:01:42.716 --> 00:01:51.025]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:58.950]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:02.733]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:05.895]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:11.579]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:25.983]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:27.543]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:02:27.943 --> 00:02:33.565]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:37.615]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:43.578]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:02:43.858 --> 00:02:53.322]  High-quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:02:53.603 --> 00:02:58.165]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:00.185]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:03.026]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:03:03.306 --> 00:03:09.427]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.

[00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.010]  Three years in the making, incredible research, and the very best ingredients.
[00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.131]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[00:03:27.844 --> 00:03:31.126]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:03:31.527 --> 00:03:35.009]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:03:38.832 --> 00:03:40.373]  My name is Alex Jones.
[00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:46.678]  Most of you know me from my syndicated radio program and my documentary films, as well as InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:03:46.898 --> 00:03:57.186]  When I got on air 20 years ago, I had discovered the Globalist program, their plan to take over the world, and my focus went from running six miles every other day
[00:03:57.646 --> 00:04:03.569]  Swimming 2-3 miles a couple times a week and lifting weights to focusing on fighting the globalists.
[00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:11.792]  I've gone from 279 pounds all the way down to 235 pounds and the weight's going off even faster.
[00:04:11.993 --> 00:04:17.295]  And it wasn't just that my weight loss accelerated, my muscle mass increased, my stamina.
[00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:19.176]  My energy levels exploded.
[00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:25.179]  Super Male has the key concentrated natural compounds that my body needed to go to the next level.
[00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:31.523]  Today is the day to take the InfoWarsLife.com challenge and to secure your bottle of Super Male or Super Female Vitality.
[00:04:31.703 --> 00:04:35.445]  Check them out today at InfoWarsLife.com or give our crew a call at 888-253-3139.
[00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:59.962]  We are back live on the InfoWars Defence of Liberty 13-hour special broadcast.
[00:05:00.002 --> 00:05:03.605]  We're going to go over a host of news over the next 60 minutes, of course.
[00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:06.467]  This is all about defending InfoWars.com.
[00:05:06.948 --> 00:05:09.850]  Never have we been under more sustained attack.
[00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:11.692]  And it's completely across the board.
[00:05:11.732 --> 00:05:13.714]  I mean, you saw what they did to Milo.
[00:05:14.134 --> 00:05:15.275]  This fake setup.
[00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:16.936]  They had the material for months.
[00:05:17.577 --> 00:05:23.001]  He made comments, not even as bad as similar people have made comments about the similar subject.
[00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:24.503]  Bill Maher said similar things.
[00:05:24.563 --> 00:05:26.804]  Other leftists have said similar things.
[00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:32.069]  And basically, it was a concerted attempt to sabotage and destroy Milo.
[00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:33.990]  Of course, he'll be back.
[00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.011]  He already is back.
[00:05:35.512 --> 00:05:39.255]  But again, it's about creating these wedges, creating these divisions.
[00:05:39.935 --> 00:05:46.120]  And of course, it's about sabotaging our financial platform, which, as you well know by now, is what's happening within 4Wars.com.
[00:05:46.641 --> 00:05:52.085]  They're literally trying to sabotage our advertising, trying to attack us at the base level.
[00:05:52.125 --> 00:06:00.393]  Of course, they can't debate us, they can't fight with us, they can't beat us on an equal playing field, on a level playing field.
[00:06:01.033 --> 00:06:14.876]  So they always go for the most insidious, underhanded methods, which is to character assassinate us and attack our financial backing, which is why we need your support now more than ever.
[00:06:15.436 --> 00:06:16.576]  This is not a cliche.
[00:06:16.616 --> 00:06:26.778]  This is an absolute red alert right now because we're being attacked on all fronts, not just hit pieces, but actual financial attacks now being led.
[00:06:27.538 --> 00:06:34.600]  By the screeching lunatics that have contracted post-Hillary PTSD in the aftermath of the election.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.541]  Absolutely hysterical.
[00:06:37.841 --> 00:06:39.322]  And this is how they're lashing out.
[00:06:39.382 --> 00:06:45.243]  So we need your support more than ever by getting the Defend InfoWars specials at infowarsstore.com.
[00:06:46.064 --> 00:06:50.305]  They include Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, 33% off stock price.

[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.561]  There's the bookmark to prove it if you flash that up on screen.
[00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:18.543]  The Making of the President 2016 by Roger Stone.
[00:07:18.883 --> 00:07:20.744]  Show it on screen so they know I'm reading it.
[00:07:20.764 --> 00:07:21.084]  There it is.
[00:07:21.944 --> 00:07:22.584]  See the bookmark?
[00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:23.705]  That means I'm actually reading it.
[00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:38.437]  And it's excellent so far, I'm only about, what, 50 pages in, but that is the inside scoop on the election from somebody who would be in a position to know Roger Stone, and it's a really well put together book as well, really high quality book.
[00:07:39.361 --> 00:07:50.565]  It's the inside story how Donald Trump orchestrated a revolution by his former confidant Roger Stone, New York Times best-selling author, and that is available at infowarsstore.com.
[00:07:50.945 --> 00:07:56.307]  Also, you can donate directly at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:07:57.908 --> 00:08:00.429]  More important than ever that you support this network.
[00:08:00.609 --> 00:08:03.730]  We're under sustained attack every single day.
[00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.531]  I mean, we can't even keep up with them anymore.
[00:08:06.724 --> 00:08:10.767]  There are hit pieces on Alex, there are hit pieces on Infowars, there are hit pieces on me.
[00:08:11.287 --> 00:08:24.377]  They're trying to set me up in some way, all these big journalists and big news outlets, they all want to meet up with me and do an interview, which is gonna be a vicious hit piece, because it always is.
[00:08:25.078 --> 00:08:26.979]  And you know, they're always really friendly at the beginning.
[00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:28.921]  Oh, we just want to understand your perspective.
[00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:31.102]  There was actually one a couple of weeks ago,
[00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:39.985]  Which they want to be involved in, which aired on Channel 4, which is, you know, probably the third biggest news channel in the United Kingdom.
[00:08:40.706 --> 00:08:44.749]  And of course they approached me and said, we're interested in the alt-right.
[00:08:44.849 --> 00:08:50.874]  I'm not even a part of the alt-right since the media was able to seize, hijack and demonize that term.
[00:08:51.334 --> 00:08:57.639]  But they want to be on the show about the quote alt-right, you know, British Donald Trump Brexit supporters or whatever you want to call it.
[00:08:58.587 --> 00:09:00.230]  And they were really friendly about it.
[00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.992]  We just want your perspective.
[00:09:02.032 --> 00:09:04.015]  This is a neutral, balanced piece.
[00:09:05.037 --> 00:09:06.038]  I said no, of course.
[00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:07.200]  I said no to all of them.
[00:09:07.841 --> 00:09:11.286]  And then it aired, and it was literally an absolute horror show.
[00:09:12.503 --> 00:09:22.834]  First you had, you know, the foreboding b-roll, the rainy windows, the ominous music in the background, and the people they interviewed were absolute lunatics.
[00:09:23.655 --> 00:09:30.943]  This was a complete setup just to try and do a guilt by association by lumping me, Alex, and Infowars in with it.
[00:09:31.417 --> 00:09:43.745]  So the kind of people, they had a guy in a giant frog's mask, sat in his tiny apartment, you know, talking about relationship between IQ and race, all this slimy neo-Nazi stuff.
[00:09:44.345 --> 00:09:48.508]  They had an actual neo-Nazi who was a fan of Hitler and Mein Kampf.
[00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:54.151]  They had obviously, you know, social rejects, people with mental health problems.
[00:09:55.272 --> 00:09:59.395]  And it was all about the alt-right, and this was the alt-right, you know, they had an ex-BNP member.
[00:10:00.243 --> 00:10:05.584]  The basically proto-fascist party in the United Kingdom that has now declined.
[00:10:05.624 --> 00:10:17.286]  But it was all these horrible slimy people foreboding ominous B-roll and music and this was what they presented as, you know, the alternative in the United Kingdom.
[00:10:17.506 --> 00:10:19.506]  And of course, that's why they wanted me on it.
[00:10:19.526 --> 00:10:26.207]  In fact, they got one of the individuals that was on the show to basically say that I had inspired her.
[00:10:26.267 --> 00:10:28.708]  Thankfully, she was one of the less insane ones.
[00:10:29.827 --> 00:10:34.749]  But the others were absolute lunatics, to be accurate.
[00:10:35.049 --> 00:10:36.150]  And this is what they're trying to do.
[00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:37.190]  They're trying to set us up.
[00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:38.170]  They set Milo up.
[00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:41.632]  They're going after other people who won't talk about it.
[00:10:41.672 --> 00:10:43.072]  They don't want to talk about it right now.
[00:10:43.112 --> 00:10:49.335]  But there is a concerted effort across the board to try and sabotage our media platforms.
[00:10:50.538 --> 00:10:56.525]  You can trace it directly back to this PTSD that Alex talks about.
[00:10:56.985 --> 00:11:01.631]  Lazy Milo Yiannopoulos, of course, was basically forced to resign from Breitbart.
[00:11:03.422 --> 00:11:08.244]  They've had a hysterical shrieking since Donald Trump won the election.
[00:11:08.605 --> 00:11:10.686]  This is PTSD on steroids.
[00:11:11.086 --> 00:11:23.512]  They literally think, because they've been radicalized by the back, the absolutely crazy mainstream media propaganda, they've been radicalized into thinking that Donald Trump is literally Hitler.
[00:11:23.932 --> 00:11:27.474]  And we're going to play the Tucker Carlson clip here in a couple of minutes.
[00:11:28.092 --> 00:11:37.517]  But they've literally been brainwashed and radicalised by the mainstream media that Donald Trump is literally Hitler, that he's going to incinerate the world.
[00:11:38.858 --> 00:11:44.480]  And when you feed that kind of rhetoric into people on a daily basis, how do you expect them to react?
[00:11:45.341 --> 00:11:49.423]  This is mass hysteria run wild.
[00:11:49.783 --> 00:11:53.185]  Trump has barely even had the chance to do anything.
[00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:55.266]  What, has he been in office for a month?
[00:11:56.997 --> 00:11:58.118]  How long is this gonna go on?
[00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:00.921]  In fact, it was trending on Twitter and it still is.
[00:12:01.862 --> 00:12:12.372]  The Washington Post has put a new little slogan at the top of their website, which reads, Listen to how they're framing this stuff!
[00:12:12.392 --> 00:12:14.014]  This is completely hysterical!
[00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:26.445]  They're allowed to criticise Trump and his administration 24-7 on a sustained basis on every single platform available.
[00:12:27.245 --> 00:12:32.628]  And they're still trying to make out as if he's this dark dictator that's trying to shut all the media down.
[00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:44.854]  No other president in living memory has faced this much intense slander and criticism from the mainstream media, whether you think it's justified or not.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:13:01.136]  He's not closing them down, he's not throwing people in concentration camps, as the far left revolutionary communist party member said on Tucker Carlson last night on Fox News, but this is just an example of the absolute
[00:13:02.363 --> 00:13:11.513]  PTSD, mass hysteria, which has gripped not just America, but the entire Western world after the election of Donald Trump.
[00:13:11.593 --> 00:13:13.595]  And it is quite chilling.
[00:13:14.136 --> 00:13:15.978]  Let's go to that Tucker Carlson clip now.
[00:13:16.018 --> 00:13:22.725]  This is Tucker speaking to a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party about Donald Trump.
[00:13:22.785 --> 00:13:23.265]  Here it is.
[00:13:24.412 --> 00:13:27.233]  America has not become a totalitarian death state just yet.
[00:13:27.693 --> 00:13:31.234]  Regardless, some are still trying to ignite an uprising to throw him out of power.
[00:13:31.834 --> 00:13:36.775]  A group called Refuse Fascism says its goal is to, quote, drive the Trump-Pence regime out.
[00:13:37.235 --> 00:13:45.857]  They describe it as illegitimate, a cabal of, quote, white supremacists, women haters, science deniers, religious fundamentalists, zealots, and warmongers who will eventually start a nuclear war.
[00:13:46.377 --> 00:13:47.977]  We're joined now by Sinsara Taylor.
[00:13:47.997 --> 00:13:49.958]  She's an organizer with Refuse Fascism.
[00:13:49.978 --> 00:13:50.898]  Sinsara, thanks for joining us.
[00:13:51.718 --> 00:13:59.608]  So, I was reading your manifesto tonight, and you said this, the Trump regime is a fascist regime, no insults or exaggeration, that's what it is.
[00:14:00.029 --> 00:14:03.713]  For the future of humanity and the planet, we the people must drive this regime out.
[00:14:04.434 --> 00:14:06.637]  I'm assuming you're not a moderate, necessarily.
[00:14:07.017 --> 00:14:10.382]  But the obvious question arises, which is, if it's a fascist regime, how are you on the show?
[00:14:11.397 --> 00:14:13.938]  Look, Donald, we're facing an emergency.
[00:14:14.198 --> 00:14:15.858]  Humanity is facing an emergency.
[00:14:15.918 --> 00:14:21.160]  A fascist regime has seized the reins of power in the most powerful, actually the sole superpower in the world.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.161]  Trump and Pence are operating out of Hitler's playbook.
[00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:27.162]  Only they have nuclear weapons.
[00:14:27.642 --> 00:14:35.724]  And what RefuseFascism.org is saying to the world is that while it's beautiful, it's righteous that millions of people have stood up in protest and continue to do so.
[00:14:36.124 --> 00:14:38.525]  And by the way, since I know he sometimes watches,
[00:14:39.085 --> 00:14:43.947]  President Trump, if you're watching, way more people have protested than were at your Nazi inauguration.
[00:14:44.287 --> 00:14:46.808]  But while this is beautiful, this resistance needs to grow.
[00:14:47.128 --> 00:14:49.709]  And people need to confront that this is a fascist regime.
[00:14:50.109 --> 00:14:51.970]  They could drop the hammer and close down.
[00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.731]  It's working aggressively to close down the space for people to stand up and resist.
[00:14:56.111 --> 00:14:58.132]  And so, in the name of humanity.
[00:14:58.712 --> 00:15:00.154]  Seven billion on this planet.
[00:15:00.194 --> 00:15:02.057]  We need to pour into the streets and say no.
[00:15:02.478 --> 00:15:04.621]  We refuse to accept a fascist America.
[00:15:04.961 --> 00:15:08.226]  We refuse to accept this for the world and we must drive them out.
[00:15:08.246 --> 00:15:09.408]  We need to stay in the streets.
[00:15:09.568 --> 00:15:11.771]  I mean so many questions come to mind but the obvious one is this.
[00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:13.394]  I always thought that the day
[00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:16.516]  Somebody got up, a Republican, and said, you know what?
[00:15:16.536 --> 00:15:20.739]  We've got to focus on jobs, no more pointless wars in the Middle East, and by the way, I'm a secular guy.
[00:15:20.759 --> 00:15:24.121]  They would say, you know, that's kind of my kind of Republican.
[00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:35.508]  A man who campaigned and said, I long for the days when protesters were dragged out on stretchers, who offered to pay the bills of people who assaulted protesters at his rally.
[00:15:35.528 --> 00:15:36.968]  Donald Trump is a fascist.
[00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:38.850]  That's out of Hitler's playbook.
[00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.071]  This is a danger.
[00:15:41.411 --> 00:15:41.991]  To humanity.
[00:15:42.031 --> 00:15:46.814]  And yes, it's in its early stages, but people need to rise up and stop it before it is too late.
[00:15:47.094 --> 00:15:48.555]  Okay, so, but I want to get to that.
[00:15:48.755 --> 00:15:49.695]  Rise up and stop it.
[00:15:49.735 --> 00:15:53.437]  So I'm assuming that, I mean, you're not serious, I mean, this is like play acting for you.
[00:15:53.457 --> 00:16:01.621]  If you really thought he was Hitler, if you really believed that he was acting according to, as you said, the playbook of Hitler, then you wouldn't stop with going on a cable show.
[00:16:01.641 --> 00:16:03.742]  I mean, you'd go all the way, wouldn't you?
[00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:06.864]  I mean, you don't really think that, or you'd be committing acts of violence, right?
[00:16:07.424 --> 00:16:08.605]  I absolutely think.
[00:16:09.165 --> 00:16:10.326]  Actually, he's not like Hitler.
[00:16:10.606 --> 00:16:17.572]  He has a Twitter feed, he has that ugly orange thing on top of his head, and he has nuclear weapons, the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world.
[00:16:17.812 --> 00:16:21.695]  And people better wake up, because he is more dangerous than Hitler ever could have been.
[00:16:21.715 --> 00:16:23.296]  But if you... I mean, let's just be real for a second.
[00:16:23.376 --> 00:16:24.938]  I know we're on TV, but please be real.
[00:16:24.998 --> 00:16:26.639]  If you really thought that... Hold on.
[00:16:26.659 --> 00:16:27.400]  Hold on.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.682]  You implied something, and I want to answer it.
[00:16:30.462 --> 00:16:33.905]  You implied that I'm going to do something that's untoward, whatever.
[00:16:33.925 --> 00:16:37.689]  I'm calling for mass political protest and resistance.
[00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:40.231]  Building on what's happened and staying in the streets.
[00:16:40.611 --> 00:16:46.777]  In the name of humanity, before the man starts, he asked three times, if I have nukes, why can't I use them?
[00:16:47.017 --> 00:16:50.778]  This is a mass incineration of human beings on an industrial scale.
[00:16:50.898 --> 00:16:52.799]  A crime against humanity.
[00:16:52.839 --> 00:16:56.160]  But let's just be more specific because I want to take you seriously.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:02.263]  I assume you're being serious, hard as it is to believe, when you use rhetoric like he's Hitler, he's going to incinerate the world.
[00:17:02.763 --> 00:17:05.364]  No, I said nuclear weapons are...
[00:17:06.104 --> 00:17:08.325]  The mass incineration of human beings.
[00:17:08.365 --> 00:17:10.966]  Oh sure, you think he could destroy the world?
[00:17:11.246 --> 00:17:13.748]  I know you like to carry water for the liar-in-chief.
[00:17:14.108 --> 00:17:19.590]  I know you like to justify and rationalize the sexual predator-in-chief, but I don't think this is a joke.
[00:17:19.931 --> 00:17:22.332]  This is for humanity, and he is dangerous.
[00:17:22.352 --> 00:17:23.972]  But what are you going to do about it, Censura?
[00:17:23.992 --> 00:17:24.893]  That's my question.
[00:17:24.973 --> 00:17:29.275]  Other than like jump around in the street with a sign in your hand, okay, no, and write your little manifesto.
[00:17:29.295 --> 00:17:30.335]  Refusefascism.org has a manifesto.
[00:17:31.556 --> 00:17:32.176]  I just read it!
[00:17:57.502 --> 00:17:58.323]  This is silly.
[00:17:58.343 --> 00:18:01.427]  You don't oppose fascism with political resistance.
[00:18:01.608 --> 00:18:05.613]  Actually, it would have taken millions and millions to rise up to stop Hitler.
[00:18:05.673 --> 00:18:06.935]  It absolutely would have.
[00:18:06.955 --> 00:18:09.078]  And it's what people should have done.
[00:18:09.158 --> 00:18:10.119]  It is shameful.
[00:18:10.399 --> 00:18:12.162]  It is shameful for you to dismiss this.
[00:18:14.685 --> 00:18:19.526]  It's funny to you, because I know you love to carry water for this criminal.
[00:18:19.546 --> 00:18:22.927]  This war criminal wanted to be in shape.
[00:18:22.947 --> 00:18:23.567]  He's itching.
[00:18:23.627 --> 00:18:25.028]  You find that a petty matter?
[00:18:25.048 --> 00:18:26.828]  Tucker, you find that petty?
[00:18:27.488 --> 00:18:30.689]  You find that a petty concern that he wants to be in shape?
[00:18:30.729 --> 00:18:31.409]  It is real.
[00:18:31.449 --> 00:18:33.590]  Nuclear weapons are as serious as you can be.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.401]  Let me ask you one last question, okay?
[00:18:37.501 --> 00:18:42.383]  62 million people voted for Trump, and disproportionately, they were people at the lower end of the income scale.
[00:18:42.423 --> 00:18:44.204]  Well, they were, actually.
[00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:46.245]  They were middle class and below, mostly.
[00:18:46.726 --> 00:18:50.207]  Opposed to Trump were, I don't know, the hedge fund managers and privileged people like you.
[00:18:50.227 --> 00:18:53.089]  Did you ever think to yourself, like, why is the middle class... Can I tell you something?
[00:18:53.289 --> 00:18:54.769]  He lost the popular vote.
[00:18:54.869 --> 00:18:58.071]  He lost the popular vote and no election fair or fraudulent.
[00:18:58.411 --> 00:19:05.834]  No election fair or fraudulent can justify ripping up the rule of law, undermining the courts, threatening and shutting down the press.
[00:19:05.874 --> 00:19:08.315]  You should throw a duly elected president out of office.
[00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:10.476]  No, I'm saying people should resist.
[00:19:10.876 --> 00:19:13.357]  Yes, that's what he means when he says so-called judge.
[00:19:13.618 --> 00:19:16.899]  That's what he means when he fires an attorney general who disagrees with his laws.
[00:19:16.919 --> 00:19:18.640]  What I want to do is get to how you think.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.641]  What you want to do is normalize fascism.
[00:19:20.901 --> 00:19:24.742]  What you want to do is try to caricature and dismiss people who are telling the truth.
[00:19:28.257 --> 00:19:36.103]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is what we're dealing with and it's not just that this is some far-left hysterical moron.
[00:19:36.663 --> 00:19:40.566]  These are the kind of people who are being legitimised by the mainstream left.
[00:19:41.086 --> 00:19:51.194]  These are the kind of people who are being radicalised by mainstream media propaganda about Trump being literally Hitler and trying to shut down the media when it's not happening at all!
[00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.112]  24-7 every single media platform you can imagine.
[00:19:56.672 --> 00:20:01.814]  The criticism, the slander, the defamation never ends.
[00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:04.095]  It's a constant sewer pipe.
[00:20:04.715 --> 00:20:06.135]  Nobody's shutting it down.
[00:20:06.616 --> 00:20:07.536]  Listen to what she said.
[00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:12.778]  She talked about a fascist regime closing down space to protest Trump.
[00:20:13.398 --> 00:20:17.640]  Literally every night there's some hissy fit toys out of the pram.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.761]  Protest against Donald Trump.
[00:20:20.925 --> 00:20:24.166]  In major cities around the world, nobody's shutting it down.
[00:20:24.186 --> 00:20:27.787]  I mean, look at what happened at the inauguration.
[00:20:27.827 --> 00:20:28.928]  The police backed off.
[00:20:28.988 --> 00:20:30.668]  They were allowed to smash windows.
[00:20:30.708 --> 00:20:32.369]  They were allowed to assault people.
[00:20:32.829 --> 00:20:34.789]  Nobody's even shutting those people down.
[00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.110]  Look at what happened at Berkeley.
[00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.011]  They were allowed to smash up buildings and assault people.
[00:20:41.391 --> 00:20:43.132]  Pepper spray women in the face.
[00:20:43.632 --> 00:20:46.413]  That's not protest, that's riot, that's criminal assault.
[00:20:46.873 --> 00:20:49.054]  They were still allowed to get away with even that.
[00:20:50.657 --> 00:20:52.678]  There's no shutdown of any of this.
[00:20:53.198 --> 00:20:54.879]  It's all in their hysterical minds.
[00:20:55.739 --> 00:20:58.261]  She said that Trump is more dangerous than Hitler.
[00:20:58.741 --> 00:21:08.946]  I mean, is there anything that's more offensive to actual victims of Hitler and their ancestors than such a stupid comment like that?
[00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:11.367]  She said Trump is a war criminal.
[00:21:11.387 --> 00:21:12.787]  He hasn't even launched any wars.
[00:21:12.807 --> 00:21:15.849]  He's been in office for four friggin' weeks!
[00:21:16.923 --> 00:21:20.805]  Oh, but, you know, Obama can drop, what, 200,000 bombs on Muslim countries.
[00:21:21.145 --> 00:21:22.545]  What has she got to say about it?
[00:21:23.105 --> 00:21:24.326]  Diddly squat.
[00:21:25.306 --> 00:21:25.746]  Nothing.
[00:21:26.347 --> 00:21:28.588]  Revolutionary Communist Party.
[00:21:28.888 --> 00:21:29.808]  Give me a break.
[00:21:31.589 --> 00:21:37.051]  Calling Trump a genocidal maniac, saying he's going to incinerate the world, commit genocide, commit mass genocide.
[00:21:37.531 --> 00:21:38.972]  Oh, what, like communism did?
[00:21:38.992 --> 00:21:42.453]  90 million people dead in the last century alone.
[00:21:43.253 --> 00:21:44.474]  That kind of genocide.
[00:21:45.575 --> 00:21:49.143]  And again, if these people were just left out on the fringe and laughed at...
[00:21:50.423 --> 00:21:51.224]  It would be one thing.
[00:21:51.284 --> 00:21:54.006]  But they're being brought into the mainstream left.
[00:21:54.687 --> 00:21:56.048]  They're being legitimised.
[00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:58.449]  You saw it after the inauguration.
[00:21:58.790 --> 00:21:59.911]  Punch a Nazi.
[00:22:00.531 --> 00:22:03.273]  Which turned into, you know, punch Milo.
[00:22:03.653 --> 00:22:09.418]  And then they had graffiti on the walls at these Antifa riots that said, Liberals get the bullet next.
[00:22:10.138 --> 00:22:14.922]  Basically anyone who's not completely unhinged and hysterical, we will violently attack you.
[00:22:15.502 --> 00:22:17.544]  Because we've got the moral high ground.
[00:22:17.624 --> 00:22:18.245]  No you don't!
[00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:20.429]  You're the friggin fascists.
[00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:22.513]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:22:22.874 --> 00:22:27.745]  These people are being brought into the mainstream left while they call us extremists.
[00:22:29.667 --> 00:22:46.651]  We're going to move into some global news now, because of course we had Trump commenting on Sweden, saying last night in Sweden, referring to a Fox News report that he'd seen about migrant crime areas in Sweden the previous night, and of course the left mocked him relentlessly.
[00:22:47.431 --> 00:22:50.232]  What was quite funny, as you heard on the report we played earlier,
[00:22:51.485 --> 00:23:05.869]  Last night in Sweden, or the night before last as it is now, there were migrant mobs rioting, burning cars, attacking reporters, looting stores, attacking shopkeepers, throwing stones at police officers.
[00:23:06.309 --> 00:23:12.091]  That happened last night in Sweden and the left had nothing whatsoever to say about that, did they?
[00:23:13.452 --> 00:23:14.592]  And now look at what's happening.
[00:23:15.643 --> 00:23:23.128]  You want to talk about hysterical, far-left, unhinged radicals who are now part of the mainstream left.
[00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:28.712]  Let's talk about Robert Reich, Berkeley professor, former US Secretary of Labor.
[00:23:29.092 --> 00:23:36.477]  This was the idiot who got up on CNN and said that Milo had paid the black bloc Antifa thugs
[00:23:37.711 --> 00:23:40.071]  To attack his own supporters.
[00:23:40.592 --> 00:23:41.972]  That it was a false flag.
[00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:45.213]  It was a conspiracy set up by Milo and Breitbart.
[00:23:45.533 --> 00:23:47.093]  They didn't even challenge him on it.
[00:23:48.013 --> 00:23:50.033]  He's back with more insanity.
[00:23:50.594 --> 00:23:52.234]  This is out of Information Liberation.
[00:23:52.614 --> 00:23:56.015]  Berkeley Professor Robert Reich blames Trump for riot in Sweden.
[00:23:56.375 --> 00:24:02.136]  According to Berkeley Professor and former US Secretary of Labour Robert Reich,
[00:24:03.106 --> 00:24:06.647]  Donald Trump's lies caused the riots in Sweden on Monday night.
[00:24:07.007 --> 00:24:19.829]  This is a continuation of everything we saw throughout the campaign, where it was Donald Trump's rhetoric that was responsible for anti-Trump agitators beating up Donald Trump supporters.
[00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:21.450]  And it continues.
[00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:27.671]  Earlier this month, Reich floated the insane conspiracy theory that Breitbart plants were responsible for the riots at Berkeley.
[00:24:28.211 --> 00:24:31.712]  That's since been thoroughly debunked, as if it even needed to be debunked.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:38.664]  Floating another loony theory, on Tuesday, Reich said on Twitter, quote, Trump's lies have consequences.
[00:24:38.684 --> 00:24:43.367]  48 hours after his comments on Sweden, riots broke out in an immigrant community.
[00:24:46.309 --> 00:24:59.897]  Now if Robert Reich had actually read the news reports as to why there was a riot in that migrant suburb of Stockholm on Monday night, he would have seen that it was because the police arrested a drug dealer.
[00:25:01.112 --> 00:25:04.873]  And the local population didn't like that one bit, so they rioted.
[00:25:05.213 --> 00:25:08.774]  They burned up cars, they attacked journalists, they attacked police.
[00:25:09.215 --> 00:25:16.117]  That was why they rioted, because their local drug dealer, the poor baby that he is, had been arrested by the cops.
[00:25:17.357 --> 00:25:23.639]  It wasn't because of anything that Donald Trump had said three days before, you frigging idiot!
[00:25:26.209 --> 00:25:32.316]  He'll probably get up on CNN tomorrow or tonight and say the same thing and Don Lemon won't even challenge him on it.
[00:25:32.837 --> 00:25:33.978]  Because that's the way it's going.
[00:25:34.741 --> 00:25:54.858]  But you know, Trump is going to incinerate the world, so in comparison, I guess that's a reasonable opinion to claim that Trump, by mistake, staying last night in Sweden, referring to a Fox News report, he caused riots in a migrant suburb of Stockholm, Sweden, 48 hours later.
[00:25:55.918 --> 00:25:57.059]  Absolutely insane.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:03.605]  The left has gone absolutely insane and they're not even getting called out for it by the supposed moderate mainstream left.
[00:26:05.512 --> 00:26:13.939]  Sticking on Sweden, given that there are several stories today about Sweden, as there always are, because it's an absolute liberal utopia that we should all aspire to.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.361]  This is out of Gatestone Institute.
[00:26:16.421 --> 00:26:20.384]  Migrant fights two-month sentence after raping two underage Swedish girls.
[00:26:20.725 --> 00:26:22.706]  Thinks punishment is too severe.
[00:26:22.726 --> 00:26:24.408]  Yeah.
[00:26:24.968 --> 00:26:31.474]  In what kind of messed up world do you get just two months in prison for raping a child?
[00:26:32.944 --> 00:26:33.364]  Sweden!
[00:26:33.665 --> 00:26:34.845]  Once again, Sweden.
[00:26:34.945 --> 00:26:35.886]  Where else would it be?
[00:26:36.447 --> 00:26:45.073]  A Syrian migrant who was recently sentenced by a Swedish court to two months in prison for brutally raping a 13-year-old girl in a school toilet.
[00:26:45.793 --> 00:26:47.074]  Two months in prison!
[00:26:47.835 --> 00:26:50.116]  And sexually abusing a 14-year-old victim.
[00:26:50.497 --> 00:26:52.558]  Yesterday appealed the verdict.
[00:26:53.659 --> 00:26:57.342]  Appealed the verdict of two months in prison for raping a child.
[00:26:57.722 --> 00:26:58.963]  Because that's too harsh.
[00:27:00.708 --> 00:27:05.790]  This is what we're all going to end up like in 10 years if we follow the path that Sweden has taken.
[00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:11.631]  His lawyer wants the former refugee who is either 18 or 19 years old.
[00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:12.992]  That's probably BS.
[00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:16.873]  Tons of cases where they lie about their age, they've got no papers.
[00:27:17.513 --> 00:27:23.835]  But the lawyer wants this guy who raped a 13-year-old girl in a toilet set free immediately.
[00:27:23.855 --> 00:27:28.076]  Because two months in prison for raping a kid, that's too harsh.
[00:27:28.356 --> 00:27:29.777]  That's not liberal enough, is it?
[00:27:31.513 --> 00:27:39.241]  The serial child rapist should be sentenced to a much lighter sentence, the lawyer has stated according to Sweden Radio.
[00:27:39.782 --> 00:27:42.705]  Yes, this is an actual report.
[00:27:43.165 --> 00:27:46.709]  The attorney asked for another ruling in the case because his client was supposedly only 17.
[00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:50.331]  When he committed the crimes again, they always lie about their age.
[00:27:50.951 --> 00:27:53.152]  They were carried out with just a few weeks in between.
[00:27:53.292 --> 00:27:58.634]  During the initial trial against the youth, it appeared that he was registered as 18 years of age when entering Sweden.
[00:27:59.234 --> 00:28:12.138]  However, the court subsequently raised questions, freshly produced documents from the assailant's home country somehow proved to the judges that he was actually one year younger than previously stated, turning him into a minor at the time of the rapes.
[00:28:14.141 --> 00:28:16.382]  I'm sure he didn't lie about it or get fake papers.
[00:28:16.883 --> 00:28:23.046]  But still, even if he was 17, no charge whatsoever for raping a 13-year-old girl.
[00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:25.348]  That's what the lawyer is pushing for.
[00:28:25.908 --> 00:28:28.930]  The attack on the 13-year-old was the most brutal of two crimes.
[00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:35.494]  Just before Christmas, the girl was violently raped in her own school in Östersund, an urban area in the middle of Sweden.
[00:28:35.574 --> 00:28:36.954]  I'm sure it's a very pleasant place.
[00:28:36.974 --> 00:28:37.275]  There's no
[00:28:38.325 --> 00:28:39.926]  Problems whatsoever with migrants there.
[00:28:39.986 --> 00:28:42.008]  It's all a right-wing conspiracy theory.
[00:28:42.889 --> 00:28:48.054]  After meeting the migrant through Snapchat, the Syrian forcibly dragged the victim to the school restrooms.
[00:28:48.134 --> 00:28:51.937]  Once there, he locked the doors and raped her, both vaginally and anally.
[00:28:52.337 --> 00:28:56.121]  After the sex attack, the man threatened the child with violence if she went to the police.
[00:28:58.223 --> 00:28:58.423]  Again.
[00:28:59.409 --> 00:29:08.157]  Women in Sweden, they don't even want to go to the police anymore because in some circles it's treated as racist to even report being raped by a migrant.
[00:29:08.577 --> 00:29:11.299]  The reporting of rape has gone down in Sweden.
[00:29:12.861 --> 00:29:18.706]  They're across the media over the past few days brazenly lying, claiming that rapes have gone down in Sweden.
[00:29:19.727 --> 00:29:23.290]  And it only shows they went up because they changed the definition of rate?
[00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.710]  Well, no.
[00:29:24.311 --> 00:29:34.539]  They changed that before a year ago, yet if you look from 2014 to 2015, it basically doubled after they changed the definition.
[00:29:34.619 --> 00:29:36.380]  So that's not the explanation.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:43.706]  But you've got government officials, reporters from Sweden, going on Fox News brazenly lying.
[00:29:45.327 --> 00:29:47.308]  Meanwhile, this cretin
[00:29:48.228 --> 00:29:52.332]  Got two months in prison for raping a kid and they're trying to get him off completely.
[00:29:53.313 --> 00:29:55.555]  Maybe Hillary Clinton can help her hand.
[00:29:55.595 --> 00:29:58.838]  She's really good at getting child molesters off the hook, isn't she?
[00:29:59.819 --> 00:30:08.387]  The older victim, there were two victims, who had also claimed rape, was nearly 15 years old and therefore close to Sweden's age of sexual consent.
[00:30:08.407 --> 00:30:09.088]  The court considered
[00:30:09.946 --> 00:30:13.548]  Miraculously turning the rape into the sexual exploitation of a child.
[00:30:13.969 --> 00:30:16.550]  So again, in that case, the sentence was made lighter.
[00:30:17.271 --> 00:30:19.792]  Absolutely insane what is happening in Sweden.
[00:30:21.834 --> 00:30:27.917]  Oh, by the way, it's also... Malmö, Sweden, is the grenade capital of Europe because it's culturally enriched now.
[00:30:28.258 --> 00:30:29.558]  This is out of Gateway Pundit.
[00:30:29.959 --> 00:30:31.820]  Another grenade found in Malmö.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.542]  There were at least 30 grenade attacks in Malmö, Sweden, in 2015.
[00:30:37.768 --> 00:30:41.251]  Malmo, of course, is 43% foreign-born population.
[00:30:41.431 --> 00:30:44.434]  Some areas of Malmo, like Rosengård, are 90% Muslim.
[00:30:44.474 --> 00:30:45.995]  That's just a coincidence, I'm sure.
[00:30:46.616 --> 00:30:53.122]  Grenade attacks have increased significantly in Sweden over the past decade as tens of thousands of migrants and refugees have been welcomed into the country.
[00:30:54.226 --> 00:30:57.908]  We've also got an 84% increase in gun crime.
[00:30:58.609 --> 00:31:05.033]  But again, they get up on the news and lie about it because violence in domestic disputes has gone down.
[00:31:05.093 --> 00:31:07.855]  So they take that, they conflate all the statistics.
[00:31:08.355 --> 00:31:16.160]  If you look at gun crime, it's up 84% in Sweden, because these gangs, these migrant gangs are all at war with each other.
[00:31:16.977 --> 00:31:22.339]  Which is kind of ironic, because a lot of the innocent victims are actually migrants who didn't do anything wrong.
[00:31:22.399 --> 00:31:26.401]  They're caught in the crossfire of these attacks, these gang attacks.
[00:31:27.001 --> 00:31:36.284]  But still, the left doesn't care, because if they had to admit there was a problem, they would have to admit that mass immigration, uncontrolled, was a dreadful idea.
[00:31:36.404 --> 00:31:40.666]  And they're never going to do that, even as cities are torn apart.
[00:31:41.792 --> 00:31:45.915]  So Sweden is the grenade capital, or Malmo is the grenade capital of Sweden.
[00:31:46.635 --> 00:31:49.517]  I've got friends who go to Malmo literally every month.
[00:31:50.037 --> 00:31:59.122]  They say, and the top police officers who have gone public on this say, you walk down the street at night and you just hear explosions going off left, right and centre.
[00:31:59.423 --> 00:32:00.483]  That is normal now.
[00:32:00.824 --> 00:32:03.425]  They actually classified grenades as fireworks.
[00:32:04.446 --> 00:32:07.007]  Again, as a means of massaging the crime stats.
[00:32:08.308 --> 00:32:09.309]  Absolutely insane.
[00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:16.754]  Now, of course, there are tons of areas in Sweden which are perfectly safe and peaceful and nice, which is where all the leftists live.
[00:32:16.794 --> 00:32:21.957]  The people who love mass immigration never live anywhere near immigrant areas.
[00:32:22.417 --> 00:32:27.380]  They just sit in their ivory towers and lecture us all about how progressive they are.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:37.846]  So, yeah, there are many nice areas in Sweden, but they've got serious problems, and the government lying about it repeatedly is not going to fix those problems.
[00:32:39.417 --> 00:32:57.248]  The people who are trying to point out the problems, in one case an economist, actually a Kurdish economist, he's come out with a new book basically talking in a dry academic way about the impact immigration has had on Sweden with the numbers, the ones that are still available at least.
[00:32:57.288 --> 00:33:03.952]  They stopped taking numbers on ethnicity of crime suspects back in 2005 because it wasn't very convenient for them.
[00:33:05.051 --> 00:33:13.477]  So a new factual book about Swedish immigration is now considered racist by a Karo library in Stockholm, and it will not be purchased.
[00:33:13.838 --> 00:33:19.142]  But the library has no problem keeping Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf or other controversial books in its collection.
[00:33:20.154 --> 00:33:25.082]  So they actually refused to stock a book by an economist.
[00:33:25.522 --> 00:33:27.686]  This wasn't some right-wing neo-Nazis book.
[00:33:27.726 --> 00:33:34.777]  It was a dry academic book written by an economist about immigration in Sweden and this library.
[00:33:35.848 --> 00:33:40.632]  ...in Stockholm is so progressive that it refuses to stock the book.
[00:33:40.712 --> 00:33:42.874]  Maybe they'll just start burning the books next.
[00:33:43.474 --> 00:33:49.118]  Just burn all the books that challenge our consensus opinion because that, again, is liberal and progressive.
[00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:52.141]  Sweden is the basket case of Europe.
[00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.831]  Again, it's a terrifying warning to America.
[00:33:56.171 --> 00:33:58.773]  Do not follow their example.
[00:33:59.173 --> 00:34:02.514]  Please do everything in your power not to follow their example.
[00:34:03.435 --> 00:34:04.975]  That is Sweden in a nutshell.
[00:34:05.256 --> 00:34:09.558]  And those, what, three or four stories I just covered, they're just from today.
[00:34:10.338 --> 00:34:12.179]  Just from today in Sweden.
[00:34:13.166 --> 00:34:16.648]  Going to go to a break now on this special broadcast.
[00:34:16.728 --> 00:34:23.493]  We will be back with information on how you can support InfoWars at this crucial time as we're under attack constantly.
[00:34:23.994 --> 00:34:25.775]  We'll be back in a couple of minutes.
[00:34:42.924 --> 00:34:49.072]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[00:34:49.613 --> 00:34:51.095]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[00:34:51.956 --> 00:34:53.878]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[00:34:54.459 --> 00:34:59.966]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[00:35:00.587 --> 00:35:00.848]  Of course!
[00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:20.831]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[00:35:21.332 --> 00:35:24.494]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[00:35:24.794 --> 00:35:28.877]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[00:35:29.057 --> 00:35:29.838]  You cannot lose.
[00:35:29.878 --> 00:35:30.978]  You're funding the Infowar.
[00:35:31.279 --> 00:35:38.024]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[00:35:38.364 --> 00:35:42.287]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[00:35:43.067 --> 00:35:49.568]  Hey folks, I'm on break right now, and these incredible 2000 lithograph prints came in.
[00:35:50.228 --> 00:35:52.809]  And we've already sold out of 500 of them, so thank you for the support.
[00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:53.909]  But listen, they're only $19.95.
[00:35:54.009 --> 00:35:59.730]  If you buy these in art houses across the country, they're as much as $200 a piece.
[00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:03.111]  Especially the one of Reagan, because it's the most iconic.
[00:36:03.451 --> 00:36:07.592]  We're gonna be carrying these soon, we hope, but again, he has to produce a limited edition.
[00:36:07.612 --> 00:36:08.352]  Let me show you.
[00:36:08.652 --> 00:36:10.714]  You can read all about the artist, uh, and more.
[00:36:11.354 --> 00:36:13.216]  But he sent this to us months ago.
[00:36:13.236 --> 00:36:16.319]  Uh, one is signed to me.
[00:36:16.339 --> 00:36:16.379]  11-8-2016.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.403]  Simply amazing.
[00:36:20.683 --> 00:36:24.747]  Right over here is his super famous, uh, Reagan photo.
[00:36:25.167 --> 00:36:26.248]  Or-or-or-or drawing.
[00:36:26.288 --> 00:36:27.649]  Now, no, this is kind of a dark hallway.
[00:36:27.949 --> 00:36:29.991]  But-but, you know, you've gotta go to the website and see for yourself.
[00:36:30.211 --> 00:36:31.413]  But it doesn't do it justice.
[00:36:31.453 --> 00:36:33.975]  You see the parchment paper and the print.
[00:36:34.295 --> 00:36:34.896]  That's what we do.

[00:38:46.807 --> 00:38:48.449]  Everybody is attack across the board.
[00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.731]  And now it's happening to us as well.
[00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:51.652]  That's not a cliche.
[00:38:51.692 --> 00:38:52.993]  It's actually happening.
[00:38:53.633 --> 00:38:56.275]  Fangs are out and they're about to sink them in.
[00:38:56.856 --> 00:38:59.778]  They're trying to centre us by all means possible.
[00:39:00.238 --> 00:39:02.319]  Again, they can't play on a level playing field.
[00:39:02.359 --> 00:39:03.580]  We need your support right now.

[00:39:29.643 --> 00:39:35.725]  The globalists hate that InfoWars is not beholden to the megabanks or government handouts because it means our message cannot be censored or controlled.
[00:39:36.725 --> 00:39:37.826]  That is completely true!
[00:39:38.735 --> 00:39:40.335]  We're beholden only to you.

[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.741]  Dependent on that, we're dependent on you.

[00:40:33.071 --> 00:40:35.332]  That is the book right there, The Making of the President.

[00:40:41.537 --> 00:40:42.798]  Just getting into that right now.
[00:40:43.318 --> 00:40:51.725]  The Making of the President by Roger Stone, the inside scoop on how Donald Trump upset all the odds to take the presidency.
[00:40:52.585 --> 00:40:52.725]  So,
[00:40:53.726 --> 00:40:55.007]  We need you now more than ever.
[00:40:55.447 --> 00:40:57.047]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:40:57.447 --> 00:40:58.648]  This is not a cliche.
[00:40:58.668 --> 00:41:01.009]  This is deadly serious.
[00:41:01.449 --> 00:41:05.991]  They're trying basically to completely derail us by all means possible.
[00:41:06.771 --> 00:41:08.672]  Not by fair means, but by foul.
[00:41:08.732 --> 00:41:09.932]  It's happening to other people.
[00:41:09.992 --> 00:41:11.713]  It's happening to us right now.
[00:41:12.998 --> 00:41:27.527]  And again, I was talking earlier about just this hysterical PTSD, froth fest, this toys out of the pram, autistic screeching from the left at absolutely everything.
[00:41:28.007 --> 00:41:34.831]  You heard the ridiculous revolutionary communist member on Tucker Carlson thinking that Trump is going to incinerate the earth.
[00:41:35.692 --> 00:41:38.194]  These are radicalised, dangerous people.
[00:41:38.654 --> 00:41:40.355]  I've predicted for a while that one of them
[00:41:40.962 --> 00:41:44.623]  Or a group of them is just going to start going, you know, weatherman style.
[00:41:44.643 --> 00:41:47.744]  They're just going to start blowing up police stations and government buildings.
[00:41:48.425 --> 00:41:58.848]  They're that radicalised by this absolute insanity, this hysterical insanity, that they think they're literally crusading against Hitler.
[00:41:59.188 --> 00:42:06.090]  If you actually start to believe that, you will go to any means necessary to carry out your mission.
[00:42:06.831 --> 00:42:10.312]  I think we're going to see domestic terrorism if this isn't scaled back.
[00:42:11.974 --> 00:42:14.836]  You know, on a scale that we haven't seen in decades here in America.
[00:42:15.136 --> 00:42:15.777]  Listen to this.
[00:42:15.817 --> 00:42:20.600]  This is out of the Gateway Pundit, NYU professor and former leftist.
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.142]  This was a guy who was against George W. Bush.
[00:42:23.982 --> 00:42:28.646]  Nothing comes close to personal invective, insults and degrading imagery of the left.
[00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:30.067]  Listen to what he said.
[00:42:30.467 --> 00:42:34.170]  This is Michael Rechtenbold, professor at New York University.
[00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:44.994]  He basically appeared on the O'Reilly Factor, not even the show, that's watched by millions of people of course, but on Bill O'Reilly's podcast.
[00:42:45.614 --> 00:42:58.345]  So this former leftist, again, back in the day, anti-George W. Bush, traditional leftist, went on O'Reilly's podcast and he was absolutely savage for it.
[00:42:58.405 --> 00:43:00.007]  Listen to what he wrote on Facebook.
[00:43:00.882 --> 00:43:18.031]  I was on the receiving end of a Twitter S-H-I-T storm from hell last night, after O'Reilly tweeted my handle and interview, and after I suggested that Milo Yiannopoulos was a liberal, the same people hanging him, if Milo was a liberal, the same people hanging him symbolically now would be defending him, zealously.
[00:43:18.652 --> 00:43:19.172]  The result?
[00:43:19.632 --> 00:43:20.793]  Twitter hell on earth.
[00:43:21.513 --> 00:43:24.415]  Listen to what he says, bearing in mind this is a former liberal.
[00:43:25.848 --> 00:43:30.109]  I don't want to reproduce the putrid and vile character of this attack, but I will say this.
[00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:43.614]  Today's left is rife with the most obscene, abusive, nasty, spiritually ugly and utterly unethical, hypocritical and fanatically horrible people I've ever encountered in my 58 years on earth.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.061]  This was a liberal, this was a former liberal guy.
[00:43:49.661 --> 00:44:05.746]  He says, when I was a left liberal activist and founder of Citizens for the Legitimate Government, after the first George W. Bush election, he puts in quotes, again suggesting he thinks it was stolen, so again he wasn't a right winger, I routinely received hate mail from right wingers, they were routinely mean spirited.
[00:44:06.026 --> 00:44:07.707]  But now that I'm a critic of the left,
[00:44:08.965 --> 00:44:18.111]  Nothing from the past comes close to the kind of personal invective, baseless insults, vilely degrading language and imagery that I was barraged with from these leftists.
[00:44:18.872 --> 00:44:25.917]  And all because I critiqued an ideology and its mechanisms and critiqued the hypocrisy of today's illiberal leftists.
[00:44:27.179 --> 00:44:28.580]  This is what he concludes it with.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:33.883]  The left has utterly and completely lost its way and I no longer want anything to do with it.
[00:44:34.364 --> 00:44:40.808]  I include most milieus of Marxism as well, as these have resorted to the same tactics in conjunction with the others.
[00:44:41.208 --> 00:44:42.209]  Goodbye to all that.
[00:44:42.569 --> 00:44:43.189]  Goodbye.
[00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:53.696]  So he is absolutely astonished by the sheer hatred he received simply for appearing on Bill O'Reilly's podcast.
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.581]  And again, he makes the point in the past, he's received hate from the right wing.
[00:44:59.082 --> 00:45:05.904]  I've received hate from the right wing, you know, the actual racists within the alt-right, the Jew obsessives and those kind of people.
[00:45:06.684 --> 00:45:07.825]  Yeah, I get hate from them.
[00:45:07.885 --> 00:45:10.846]  It is nothing like what you will get from the left.
[00:45:11.546 --> 00:45:12.687]  Nothing like it.
[00:45:13.347 --> 00:45:21.330]  Just the absolute vulgarity, the vicious personal nature of it, the death threats, the financial threats.
[00:45:22.537 --> 00:45:26.278]  Which is what we're experiencing right now, because these people don't play by the rules.
[00:45:27.158 --> 00:45:31.560]  They don't play on a level playing field because they can't win the debate that way.
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:43.964]  The other thing they do is, the left, the new left, which has been legitimised by the mainstream left, the hysterical new left, they don't have any principles, but they know that we do.
[00:45:44.684 --> 00:45:47.325]  Now we're not perfect, but we try to maintain principles.
[00:45:48.345 --> 00:45:52.827]  Like, we may disagree with what you say, but we're going to fight to the death for your right to say it.
[00:45:53.207 --> 00:46:02.070]  We're not going to personally harass you and try to financially attack you if you have an opinion which differs to ours.
[00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:04.311]  Because we have principles.
[00:46:04.631 --> 00:46:12.854]  We're not going to call on the state and on giant corporations to censor you out of existence just because we disagree with your opinion.
[00:46:15.373 --> 00:46:16.153]  That's the difference.
[00:46:16.193 --> 00:46:16.974]  We have principals.
[00:46:16.994 --> 00:46:18.254]  They don't have any principals.
[00:46:18.294 --> 00:46:19.115]  They don't care.
[00:46:19.595 --> 00:46:21.576]  They don't care about having a debate.
[00:46:21.896 --> 00:46:23.837]  They just want to shut us down.
[00:46:25.918 --> 00:46:27.379]  Most people don't understand that.
[00:46:27.779 --> 00:46:29.540]  They don't want a debate, okay?
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.760]  They're not interested.
[00:46:31.081 --> 00:46:32.321]  They want us gone.
[00:46:32.902 --> 00:46:33.602]  Completely.
[00:46:34.758 --> 00:46:42.342]  They want to be in their own echo chamber, their own bubble, their own safe space, and they don't want anyone to challenge that.
[00:46:42.382 --> 00:46:44.163]  They're not interested in debate.
[00:46:44.463 --> 00:46:48.085]  They're only interested in shutting us down completely.
[00:46:48.605 --> 00:47:02.352]  And that is a perfect example from a leftist professor describing the putrid, vile character of the attack against him simply because he appeared on Bill O'Reilly's podcast.
[00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:05.239]  These are the kind of people we're dealing with.
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:13.661]  You've seen the Antifa scum attack innocent women on the street for attending a speech about ideas.
[00:47:15.802 --> 00:47:19.463]  Now they're growing in power because they're being legitimized by the left.
[00:47:20.563 --> 00:47:29.185]  There was a Twitter user a few weeks ago now who was threatening, I think it was Cassandra Fairbanks, who herself used to be a leftist,
[00:47:30.421 --> 00:47:32.162]  This was an Antifa member.
[00:47:32.782 --> 00:47:34.984]  Cassandra Fairbanks is now a Trump supporter.
[00:47:35.024 --> 00:47:39.447]  This Antifa thug threatened to kill her children.
[00:47:39.787 --> 00:47:44.210]  Threatened physical harm against her children because she knew them personally.
[00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:45.550]  They were former friends.
[00:47:46.111 --> 00:47:55.997]  She went on Twitter for days on end and broadcast these direct violent threats against children and Twitter did absolutely nothing for days.
[00:47:57.639 --> 00:48:01.590]  The sheer deluge of attention on it finally got their account suspended.
[00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:03.815]  They were violently threatening children.
[00:48:04.392 --> 00:48:06.292]  These are the kind of people that we're dealing with.
[00:48:06.672 --> 00:48:09.113]  And again, they're being brought into the Main Street left.
[00:48:09.473 --> 00:48:10.853]  They're being legitimized.
[00:48:11.473 --> 00:48:12.634]  That's always the difference.
[00:48:12.714 --> 00:48:14.034]  The right has its crazies.
[00:48:14.514 --> 00:48:16.454]  The left has its crazies.
[00:48:16.735 --> 00:48:20.175]  The difference is the right doesn't try to legitimize its crazies.
[00:48:20.655 --> 00:48:21.656]  It disavows them.
[00:48:22.376 --> 00:48:25.496]  The left praises them, legitimizes them.
[00:48:25.796 --> 00:48:28.037]  They support attacks on Trump supporters.
[00:48:28.834 --> 00:48:31.155]  You know, Time Magazine, in defense of rioting.
[00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:33.275]  It all gets legitimized.
[00:48:33.796 --> 00:48:45.299]  They're pumping out this constant drumbeat that Trump is going to incinerate the world, that he's going to shut down media, that he's an anti-Semite, based on absolutely nothing!
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:54.522]  He's in full support of Israel, unlike Obama, whatever your view is on that, and yet they still call him an anti-Semite!
[00:48:56.243 --> 00:49:02.626]  Well, leftists fake hate crimes with swastikas that they drew themselves over and over again.
[00:49:03.126 --> 00:49:04.146]  Absolutely insane.
[00:49:04.767 --> 00:49:06.607]  This is the environment that we're living in now.
[00:49:07.228 --> 00:49:08.688]  Let's move on to some more news now.
[00:49:09.168 --> 00:49:13.150]  So here we have this article which is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:18.612]  People ask me why they bring in all the refugees in their millions in the case of Germany.
[00:49:18.652 --> 00:49:22.594]  Well, leftists in Germany want to give refugees the vote.
[00:49:23.753 --> 00:49:25.514]  Oh, now you begin to understand.
[00:49:26.035 --> 00:49:31.838]  Leftists in Germany want to give non-citizens, including refugees, the right to vote in elections, according to a new survey.
[00:49:32.559 --> 00:49:39.423]  So basically, they asked members of the different political parties or supporters of the different political parties in Germany
[00:49:40.205 --> 00:49:49.511]  If they supported a proposal to change electoral laws that would allow non-EU citizens living in Germany to vote.
[00:49:49.991 --> 00:49:52.433]  In other words, migrants and refugees.
[00:49:52.893 --> 00:49:53.914]  All non-citizens.
[00:49:54.834 --> 00:49:59.337]  The results were 63% of the Social Democrats supported the proposal.
[00:50:00.958 --> 00:50:03.680]  64.8% of Green Party voters supported the proposal.
[00:50:04.301 --> 00:50:07.883]  Now the problem with that is that the Social Democrat leader, Martin Schulz,
[00:50:09.076 --> 00:50:14.403]  Of course, the top EU globalist, he is likely to be Angela Merkel, who is probably just as bad.
[00:50:15.084 --> 00:50:25.278]  But the Social Democrats are going to, by the looks of the polls right now, be in power after the German federal elections, which take place on 24th of September this year.
[00:50:26.792 --> 00:50:39.541]  So Schultz, if he wants to enact this policy, has the backing of the supporters of his party who want to make it legal for non-citizens to vote in German elections.
[00:50:40.382 --> 00:50:46.506]  And of course they're going to vote for left-wing parties because those are the parties that shower them with welfare.
[00:50:47.347 --> 00:50:48.968]  So that's why they're bringing them in.
[00:50:49.228 --> 00:50:50.169]  That's why they want them
[00:50:51.411 --> 00:50:55.352]  To become citizens, but maybe not even that, to just pass laws that allow them to vote.
[00:50:55.972 --> 00:51:06.315]  The economist Martin Armstrong commented, quote, can you imagine letting everyone from Mexico come into the USA and then vote if the United States should petition Mexico to join them?
[00:51:06.976 --> 00:51:08.916]  It seems the left is just totally insane.
[00:51:08.936 --> 00:51:11.177]  They will do absolutely anything to win.
[00:51:11.637 --> 00:51:17.179]  That means they will allow all of the Middle East to enter Germany, then outnumber the Germans in their own election.
[00:51:17.279 --> 00:51:18.219]  Where is the logic here?
[00:51:19.235 --> 00:51:20.275]  Remember, we played the clip.
[00:51:20.295 --> 00:51:23.056]  Stephanie von Berg, the Green Party leader in Germany.
[00:51:23.816 --> 00:51:31.178]  She said, in 20 years, ethnic Germans will be outnumbered in their own cities, and that is a good thing.
[00:51:31.198 --> 00:51:34.699]  She said that that is a good thing.
[00:51:34.719 --> 00:51:38.120]  Because, hey, there may be no German culture left.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:42.321]  It may be completely eviscerated and replaced by a
[00:51:43.243 --> 00:51:48.247]  Not so good culture, as you've seen from all the stories emanating out of Germany, no less.
[00:51:49.007 --> 00:51:57.253]  The truck attack just a couple of months ago, she said that was a good thing, because, you know, at least we won't be called racist.
[00:51:58.594 --> 00:52:02.577]  And those are the people who will be voting, and they will vote in the Green Party.
[00:52:02.817 --> 00:52:04.798]  They will vote in the left-wing parties.
[00:52:05.259 --> 00:52:12.624]  They're willing to destroy their own country and heritage simply to remain in political power.
[00:52:13.792 --> 00:52:15.912]  These are the people we're dealing with.
[00:52:16.753 --> 00:52:17.933]  Absolutely insane.
[00:52:19.153 --> 00:52:20.813]  You want to talk about censorship?
[00:52:21.654 --> 00:52:24.794]  This is an article about Facebook out of the Christian Post.
[00:52:24.834 --> 00:52:30.915]  Facebook suspends Christian homeschool mum's account over the Post, citing Bible on homosexuality.
[00:52:32.016 --> 00:52:39.137]  Christian mother is accusing the social media giant Facebook of censorship after her account was suspended over Post on what the Bible says about homosexuality and sin.
[00:52:40.836 --> 00:52:51.458]  So basically, she posted Bible passages, she had 76,000 followers on Facebook, and they suspended her basically for hate speech.
[00:52:52.256 --> 00:52:54.017]  ...for posting passages out the Bible.
[00:52:54.378 --> 00:53:04.785]  Whether you agree with homosexuality or not, and of course 52% of Muslims in the UK don't, but, you know, they can march down the street calling for people to be beheaded, because that's progressive and liberal.
[00:53:05.346 --> 00:53:10.009]  But God forbid you're a Christian who wants to post Bible passages on Facebook.
[00:53:10.209 --> 00:53:12.051]  She was suspended.
[00:53:12.191 --> 00:53:13.292]  This is what we're talking about.
[00:53:14.892 --> 00:53:23.556]  When you allow all your content and hard work to be segregated in these social media ghettos, then they just ban you and just take it all away.
[00:53:23.576 --> 00:53:29.600]  This is why InfoWars is so important, because at least for the time being, we will always have InfoWars.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:41.466]  They can ban us on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, but we will always control our own network, but only if you support us by getting the products as they try to sabotage us.
[00:53:42.366 --> 00:53:43.507]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:53:45.356 --> 00:53:50.057]  Zero Hedge reports Florida teacher reassigned after Facebook post praising Trump on immigration.
[00:53:50.097 --> 00:53:51.778]  So again, yet another example.
[00:53:52.298 --> 00:53:56.920]  They're censoring people for posting Bible passages for being Christians.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:00.561]  They're censoring people for criticizing immigration.
[00:54:00.921 --> 00:54:11.304]  And it's only going to intensify if they're able to successfully advance this fake news narrative, which is basically we censor all dissenting opinions.
[00:54:12.842 --> 00:54:20.435]  Alex talked about it earlier, there's a Homeland show, new season of Homeland, Season 6, where they have an Alex Jones character.
[00:54:20.776 --> 00:54:22.198]  This is kind of interesting because
[00:54:23.206 --> 00:54:37.732]  I wasn't a fan of this show for a while when it started back in, I think it was 2011, but watched most of the series since, and this is an example of how politically correct culture has infested every level of society.
[00:54:37.792 --> 00:54:40.313]  Back when it started, this show was quite dynamic.
[00:54:40.353 --> 00:54:43.334]  It was interesting, because it was reality-based.
[00:54:44.135 --> 00:54:49.617]  Most of the plots are about Islamic terrorism, because most terrorist plots are Islamic.
[00:54:50.828 --> 00:54:55.971]  But around, I think it was two, three years ago, they took a decidedly social justice turn.
[00:54:56.352 --> 00:54:59.694]  And it was all about them defending terrorists, basically, legally.
[00:55:00.774 --> 00:55:03.016]  The show, of course, lost its dynamism.
[00:55:03.396 --> 00:55:05.137]  It lost a great deal of viewers.
[00:55:06.178 --> 00:55:10.281]  And now it's back in season six, trying to appease liberals.
[00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:12.942]  With a female president-elect.
[00:55:13.542 --> 00:55:16.423]  Again, showing how they were completely out of touch with reality.
[00:55:16.463 --> 00:55:18.784]  The show was written before the presidential election.
[00:55:19.144 --> 00:55:22.445]  They fully expected Hillary Clinton to win, so they wrote it into the script.
[00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:25.867]  They also wrote into the script an Alex Jones character.
[00:55:25.967 --> 00:55:28.888]  It's blatantly based on Alex Jones and no one else.
[00:55:30.389 --> 00:55:38.512]  The twist, of course, is that the guy who obsessively listens to Alex Jones in the very first episode of this season, I believe it was,
[00:55:39.648 --> 00:55:43.689]  Is somebody who was recently, in the script, a victim of a biological attack.
[00:55:43.729 --> 00:55:44.549]  He's had a stroke.
[00:55:45.189 --> 00:55:46.970]  And he's gone basically half insane.
[00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:50.450]  He's hobbling around, passing out, and attacking people violently.
[00:55:51.171 --> 00:55:53.031]  He's the one who's obsessed with Alex Jones.
[00:55:53.371 --> 00:55:54.971]  Now, can you make a connection, Nads?
[00:55:55.011 --> 00:55:56.592]  Some kind of connection they're trying to make.
[00:55:57.052 --> 00:55:58.092]  Can't quite grasp it.
[00:55:59.052 --> 00:56:02.733]  Semi-deranged, aggressive person listening to Alex Jones on the radio.
[00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:06.274]  Yeah, I think you can make that connection yourself.
[00:56:07.288 --> 00:56:09.049]  So it's blatant propaganda.
[00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:10.710]  Propaganda placement.
[00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:14.613]  Again, the point is most young people don't read newspapers.
[00:56:15.073 --> 00:56:18.115]  If they watch television news, they don't really believe it.
[00:56:19.096 --> 00:56:23.198]  There you see a clip from the current season of Homeland.
[00:56:23.839 --> 00:56:27.781]  So again, most young people aren't reading newspapers.
[00:56:27.801 --> 00:56:29.122]  They're not watching television news.
[00:56:29.162 --> 00:56:30.723]  If they're watching it, they don't believe it.
[00:56:30.783 --> 00:56:35.166]  So they have to put propaganda in the entertainment shows.
[00:56:36.957 --> 00:56:37.818]  This is what's happening.
[00:56:37.858 --> 00:56:39.340]  It's happening on British television.
[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:48.352]  Nobody trusts the news anymore, so they're literally having politicians on entertainment shows that usually host celebrities to rant about how evil Donald Trump is.
[00:56:48.372 --> 00:56:51.996]  I'm going to sign off in a minute here, but first, again,
[00:56:53.183 --> 00:56:56.164]  I implore you to go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:56:56.185 --> 00:56:59.406]  We have Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, 33% off.
[00:56:59.846 --> 00:57:02.027]  Super Male Vitality, 25% off.

[00:57:04.589 --> 00:57:06.409]  Survival Shield X2, 25% off.
[00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:08.530]  The new book by Roger Stone.
[00:57:08.871 --> 00:57:11.452]  You can get the toothpaste, you can get the lithographs.
[00:57:12.619 --> 00:57:18.523]  Free Alexa Pure with three months informal select storable food supply so you can take advantage of that offer.
[00:57:19.003 --> 00:57:19.884]  Tons of offers.
[00:57:20.204 --> 00:57:21.625]  Tons of five-star reviews.
[00:57:22.445 --> 00:57:24.227]  We need your support more than ever.
[00:57:25.167 --> 00:57:25.808]  Stock up!
[00:57:26.408 --> 00:57:29.370]  Just buy a huge amount of products.
[00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:30.311]  We need it now.
[00:57:30.371 --> 00:57:33.553]  We've just had three million dollars yanked from underneath us.
[00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:42.477]  For a news organisation that's, you know, in comparison to the giants, not that big, I mean, that is an absolutely huge amount of money.
[00:57:42.537 --> 00:57:43.658]  And it's a deliberate attack.
[00:57:43.838 --> 00:57:45.559]  You saw the email we posted.
[00:57:45.579 --> 00:57:47.501]  It was because of our political content.
[00:57:48.602 --> 00:57:51.705]  A deliberate, direct attack on our source of funding.
[00:57:52.927 --> 00:57:53.808]  Which is the products.
[00:57:54.409 --> 00:57:54.830]  That's it.
[00:57:54.910 --> 00:57:55.911]  It's not George Soros.
[00:57:55.971 --> 00:57:57.413]  It's not dictators in the Middle East.
[00:57:57.493 --> 00:57:59.376]  It's not giant pharmaceutical companies.
[00:57:59.796 --> 00:58:01.498]  It's you buying the products.
[00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:06.625]  If they remove the ability for us to advertise our own products, then we're going to sink.
[00:58:06.825 --> 00:58:08.508]  And we're going to sink fast.
[00:58:10.054 --> 00:58:13.137]  So we need you to get the product to support us more than ever.
[00:58:13.317 --> 00:58:20.985]  InfoWarsStore.com or you can make a direct donation at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:58:21.306 --> 00:58:28.813]  Absolutely vital that you do that today on an ongoing basis because unprecedented attacks
[00:58:29.738 --> 00:58:35.627]  You know, whether it be Milo, whether it be Roger Stone, everybody is under the spotlight to such a degree right now.
[00:58:36.088 --> 00:58:37.089]  The fangs are out.
[00:58:38.011 --> 00:58:41.095]  They smell blood in the water and they're coming after us.
[00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:47.995]  But we will not submit so long as we can rely on your support to hold us up in these difficult times.
[00:58:48.015 --> 00:58:51.558]  Infowarsstore.com for all the products.
[00:58:51.658 --> 00:58:55.381]  Infowars.com forward slash show to donate.
[00:58:55.882 --> 00:58:59.164]  This is the Defence of Liberty 13 hour broadcast special.
[00:58:59.585 --> 00:59:01.686]  Coming up next, Rob Dew and Owen Schroyer.
[00:59:02.327 --> 00:59:08.072]  They'll be speaking with Brittany Pettibone, who of course herself, her source of funding was attacked.
[00:59:08.092 --> 00:59:09.413]  They wouldn't even let her start.
[00:59:10.655 --> 00:59:16.738]  A GoFundMe to basically buy a microphone because she had some opinions which they disagreed with.
[00:59:17.098 --> 00:59:19.299]  They started a Twitter campaign against her!
[00:59:19.959 --> 00:59:22.760]  Just across the board they're trying to shut us down.
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:23.961]  Censorship.
[00:59:24.281 --> 00:59:24.921]  Insidious.
[00:59:25.341 --> 00:59:26.002]  Underhanded.
[00:59:26.242 --> 00:59:26.822]  Tactics.
[00:59:27.102 --> 00:59:31.426]  Because they know they're losing the debate on a level playing field.
[00:59:31.586 --> 00:59:38.011]  We whoop their ass every single time, so they have to resort to dirty tricks.
[00:59:38.051 --> 00:59:39.853]  Let's throw it back in their face.
[00:59:40.453 --> 00:59:42.155]  InfoWars.com.
[00:59:42.675 --> 00:59:44.657]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:59:45.077 --> 00:59:47.519]  Rob Dew, Owen Schroyer coming up next.
[00:59:47.799 --> 00:59:48.440]  Don't go away.
[01:00:08.619 --> 01:00:18.169]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:27.539]  And so I get questions all the time over the years, why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsStore.com or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:28.860]  And it's simple.
[01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:34.562]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[01:00:35.022 --> 01:00:36.023]  And there's a nexus point.
[01:00:36.103 --> 01:00:38.884]  There's quality versus price.
[01:00:38.924 --> 01:00:40.824]  And those two points have to come together.
[01:00:41.444 --> 01:00:54.389]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor, has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[01:00:55.791 --> 01:00:57.833]  The true next generation in body armor.
[01:00:58.754 --> 01:01:05.721]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[01:01:06.542 --> 01:01:09.325]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[01:01:09.345 --> 01:01:11.767]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[01:01:11.807 --> 01:01:15.791]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[01:01:16.231 --> 01:01:17.032]  Well, believe me,
[01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:20.815]  This is disruptive to tyrants worldwide.
[01:01:21.395 --> 01:01:31.801]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[01:01:32.461 --> 01:01:34.082]  It's nanotube technology.
[01:01:34.662 --> 01:01:36.203]  It's created here in Texas.
[01:01:36.823 --> 01:01:43.927]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[01:01:44.647 --> 01:01:44.888]  We've
[01:01:45.949 --> 01:01:47.012]  Went out and did some testing.
[01:01:47.434 --> 01:01:49.781]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[01:01:49.801 --> 01:01:50.845]  We were all kind of...
[01:01:51.653 --> 01:01:56.254]  Hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, could be so strong.
[01:01:56.495 --> 01:02:09.799]  So what we did is we went out, we used different pistols, different calibers, to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:15.120]  Born in Texas, made in America, exclusively available at m4warestore.com right now.
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:15.980]  I mean it's unbelievable.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:16.961]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:17.881]  I mean it's got a 20
[01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:19.342]  The 20-year warranty is waterproof.
[01:02:19.382 --> 01:02:19.802]  You can wear it.
[01:02:19.823 --> 01:02:20.423]  It's comfortable.
[01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:21.284]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[01:02:21.324 --> 01:02:23.646]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[01:02:24.106 --> 01:02:31.752]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[01:02:32.433 --> 01:02:36.076]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[01:02:36.096 --> 01:02:42.921]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[01:02:42.941 --> 01:02:43.822]  What did they really say about it?
[01:02:43.942 --> 01:02:45.303]  No, this is through the roof.
[01:02:45.463 --> 01:02:48.264]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[01:02:48.924 --> 01:02:57.047]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[01:02:57.527 --> 01:03:02.549]  So they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[01:03:02.629 --> 01:03:06.311]  And 90, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities from
[01:03:06.411 --> 01:03:09.512]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:12.873]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[01:03:12.933 --> 01:03:14.273]  People didn't believe in it.
[01:03:14.313 --> 01:03:15.133]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[01:03:15.173 --> 01:03:15.673]  I feed my horse hay.
[01:03:36.038 --> 01:03:38.120]  The Backpack Body Armor is only $200.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:43.244]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[01:03:44.504 --> 01:03:46.466]  Again, fund the InfoWard.
[01:03:46.526 --> 01:03:50.449]  Get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[01:03:50.949 --> 01:03:52.971]  It's a win-win.
[01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:52.971]  $200.
[01:03:53.551 --> 01:03:56.513]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWardStore.com.
[01:03:56.593 --> 01:03:57.294]  It's amazing.
[01:04:02.566 --> 01:04:16.536]  We have the new book, The Bombshell, Inside the Story of the Trump Presidency, The Making of the President by the one and only Roger Stone, available now at infowarsstore.com for 20% off on this book for a limited time only.
[01:04:16.716 --> 01:04:22.440]  This is the officially available for an exclusive 20% off introductory special at infowarsstore.com.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:26.821]  A behind-the-scenes inside story of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.
[01:04:27.021 --> 01:04:28.542]  It's never been published anywhere else.
[01:04:28.662 --> 01:04:30.622]  This is the guy who will know, of course.
[01:04:30.642 --> 01:04:34.363]  Trump advisor, comfort on every step along the way, Roger Stone.
[01:04:34.443 --> 01:04:40.905]  The making of the president details the account of Roger Stone and many other Trump insiders who have been longtime friends and advisors to Trump since the 1980s.
[01:04:42.065 --> 01:04:50.267]  The candid, bombshell, revelatory, inside story of Trump's rise to prominence and how he won the presidency.
[01:04:50.367 --> 01:04:54.909]  You will find information like this in no other book because he's got the inside skinny.
[01:04:54.989 --> 01:04:56.609]  He had it every step of the way.
[01:04:56.749 --> 01:04:59.950]  The Making of the President by Roger Stone.
[01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:02.171]  20% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:14.537 --> 01:05:19.159]  Welcome back to this InfoWars special 13-hour live broadcast.
[01:05:19.279 --> 01:05:23.041]  Owen Schroer and Rob Dew now teamed up to bring you this hour.
[01:05:23.341 --> 01:05:24.541]  And here's the deal, folks.
[01:05:24.561 --> 01:05:25.642]  You've probably heard it by now.
[01:05:25.702 --> 01:05:28.523]  We are being censored severely by AdRoll.
[01:05:28.543 --> 01:05:32.625]  They're trying to block some of our venues for funding ourselves.
[01:05:32.885 --> 01:05:34.846]  That's why we're doing this broadcast to reach out to you.
[01:05:35.226 --> 01:05:35.386]  Let's
[01:05:55.717 --> 01:05:57.899]  Three and a half million dollars last year in revenue.
[01:05:58.279 --> 01:06:00.441]  We're looking at five million this year in lost revenue.
[01:06:00.722 --> 01:06:01.702]  So we need to make that up.
[01:06:02.023 --> 01:06:03.384]  We're obviously going to keep doing stuff.
[01:06:03.404 --> 01:06:07.447]  We're going to keep doing long broadcasts like this because I think people really like them too.
[01:06:07.748 --> 01:06:10.370]  Getting everybody in, just going over the news as it happens.
[01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:11.171]  But just real quick,
[01:06:11.511 --> 01:06:15.775]  Before we go to our first guest, some of the deals out there are amazing.
[01:06:30.427 --> 01:06:31.768]  That is an amazing deal.
[01:06:58.411 --> 01:07:14.198]  Well, and if you heard what Bill Gates said last week and what he said in the past at TED Talks, I mean, and everything that's going on with Trump and the battle in the deep state, now is probably the time where you're thinking, OK, if anything bad is going to happen here, it might happen in the next four years.
[01:07:14.259 --> 01:07:15.419]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[01:07:15.439 --> 01:07:20.381]  I didn't know we had that special where we sell you the filtered water and the emergency food.
[01:07:20.481 --> 01:07:25.784]  Well, and it could be a riot situation that just breaks out in one city, like we saw in Baltimore or saw in Ferguson.
[01:07:26.124 --> 01:07:29.886]  And maybe people can't get to you for a couple days or they cut off your power gets cut off.
[01:07:29.906 --> 01:07:31.227]  Or a flood in California.
[01:07:31.327 --> 01:07:31.807]  Exactly.
[01:07:31.867 --> 01:07:32.968]  There's weather going on.
[01:07:33.608 --> 01:07:35.149]  People want to blame it on climate change.
[01:07:35.229 --> 01:07:39.191]  Al Gore wants to blame it on people breathing and automobiles when we know it's the sun.
[01:07:39.811 --> 01:07:42.753]  And those are things that weather is going to happen and there's been floods.
[01:07:43.843 --> 01:07:46.003]  Since recorded time in California.
[01:07:46.123 --> 01:07:46.404]  What?
[01:07:46.704 --> 01:07:47.764]  They had one time in the 1890s.
[01:07:47.984 --> 01:07:48.704]  Climate change?
[01:07:48.724 --> 01:07:49.324]  This is new!
[01:07:49.444 --> 01:07:52.205]  They had so much rain, they had puddles in the Mojave Desert.
[01:07:52.565 --> 01:07:54.685]  There was no climate change until humans robbed it.
[01:07:54.705 --> 01:07:55.185]  It's ridiculous.
[01:07:55.305 --> 01:08:02.567]  And we're also going to take your phone calls coming up after our guests too, so we'll give out that phone number later as we get into some articles.
[01:08:02.907 --> 01:08:04.667]  But you had something you brought to my attention.
[01:08:04.867 --> 01:08:05.127]  So?
[01:08:05.207 --> 01:08:08.048]  Having to deal with the daughter of Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[01:08:08.368 --> 01:08:17.273]  So this is actually incredible, and I know that this has made its rounds, probably most people have seen this, but I wanted to touch on this again and then segue into our guest who was also censored.
[01:08:18.073 --> 01:08:23.556]  But this is a clip from MSNBC, Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC.
[01:08:24.116 --> 01:08:25.757]  She might have outed herself
[01:08:26.577 --> 01:08:35.804]  And at least MSNBC's agenda, but what we believe is the mainstream media agenda, all of them working together, colluding to try to control what you see, what you believe.
[01:08:36.344 --> 01:08:37.705]  Let's go to this clip, guys.
[01:08:37.785 --> 01:08:39.086]  Let's just play this real clip.
[01:08:39.346 --> 01:08:49.214]  This is what Mika Brzezinski said on MSNBC as far as how they are dealing, I guess, with the reality of President Donald Trump.
[01:08:49.514 --> 01:08:50.535]  Here's Mika Brzezinski.
[01:08:51.255 --> 01:08:53.056]  He's doing, what are you so surprised about?
[01:08:53.297 --> 01:08:56.539]  He's doing exactly what he said he's going to do.
[01:08:56.919 --> 01:09:18.494]  Well, and I think that the dangerous, you know, edges here are that he's trying to undermine the media, trying to make up his own facts, and it could be that while unemployment and the economy worsens, he could have undermined the messaging so much that he can actually control exactly what people think.
[01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.296]  And that is the, that is our job.
[01:09:20.936 --> 01:09:21.936]  So there you go.
[01:09:22.456 --> 01:09:28.598]  Undermining, undermining the media to control what people think, Rob.
[01:09:29.038 --> 01:09:33.819]  Who has been saying that about the mainstream media for, I don't know, 21 years?
[01:09:33.839 --> 01:09:35.199]  Yeah, Alex Jones.
[01:09:35.219 --> 01:09:35.739]  You know what I think?
[01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:37.800]  I think Mika Brzezinski needs to throw away that sweater.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.540]  That was the most obvious thing I've ever seen.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.700]  That was actually a pussy sweater.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.241]  Yeah, well it had the little ears if you follow the horns up.
[01:09:45.521 --> 01:09:46.481]  And her white turtleneck.
[01:09:46.842 --> 01:09:54.124]  But that is the daughter of Zbigniew Brzezinski, who has actually said, it's easier to kill a million people now than it is to control a million people.
[01:09:54.584 --> 01:09:56.324]  So he is a globalist through and through.
[01:09:56.764 --> 01:10:05.327]  There's pictures of him going to shake hands with Osama bin Laden back in the late 70s, early 80s, when we were supplying them arms while they were fighting the Russians.
[01:10:05.867 --> 01:10:08.768]  Oh, we didn't think they would turn those arms against us, did we?
[01:10:09.028 --> 01:10:09.768]  Oh, but they did.
[01:10:10.228 --> 01:10:12.609]  And of course, that's what happens every time we arm these militant groups.
[01:10:12.649 --> 01:10:13.569]  And now it's happening even faster.
[01:10:13.929 --> 01:10:14.830]  Exactly, yeah.
[01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:16.331]  So, amazing.
[01:10:16.531 --> 01:10:19.353]  But yeah, that is exactly their job is to tell us what to think.
[01:10:19.653 --> 01:10:21.914]  And she's just being honest, so we can't really falter there.
[01:10:21.934 --> 01:10:25.316]  Well, and the amazing thing about this to me is, I think it goes a little deeper, Rob.
[01:10:25.336 --> 01:10:34.902]  I think it goes beyond, we know what their agenda is, is to try to control the narrative, to try to control the, or even move the Overton window wherever they feel it needs to be placed.
[01:10:35.223 --> 01:10:36.984]  But I really think it's arrogance, too.
[01:10:37.444 --> 01:10:38.305]  She's up there.
[01:10:38.945 --> 01:10:45.467]  He's arrogantly saying, how dare President Trump go against our established narrative?
[01:10:45.687 --> 01:10:51.248]  How dare Donald Trump go face-to-face, toe-to-toe with what we're reporting?
[01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:52.688]  We are the news!
[01:10:52.988 --> 01:10:53.989]  We are the media!
[01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:55.469]  We control the truth!
[01:10:55.789 --> 01:10:58.110]  How dare Donald Trump take our job?
[01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:08.512]  So I think there's an air of arrogance there, too, in the media, where it's like, we've been in control, we establish narrative, here Donald Trump comes along and just crushes them, and now they're just like,
[01:11:09.632 --> 01:11:14.294]  I think that's the big thing.
[01:11:14.674 --> 01:11:15.934]  Because Trump doesn't need them.
[01:11:16.154 --> 01:11:18.975]  He treats them as a joke when he had that last press conference.
[01:11:19.495 --> 01:11:26.077]  He was actually laughing, having a good time, and just having fun verbally sparring with these people.
[01:11:26.237 --> 01:11:28.620]  Because I think he's probably a little superior than a lot of them.
[01:11:29.021 --> 01:11:30.463]  And they just couldn't understand it.
[01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:33.567]  That, oh, oh my god, he doesn't believe in what we say.
[01:11:33.787 --> 01:11:34.949]  Oh, oh, oh.
[01:11:35.089 --> 01:11:36.030]  You call this fake news?
[01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:37.332]  I'm Jim Acosta.
[01:11:37.392 --> 01:11:39.114]  President Trump, you called me fake news.
[01:11:39.955 --> 01:11:40.496]  What's your response?
[01:11:41.497 --> 01:11:42.397]  Okay, I'm changing that.
[01:11:42.437 --> 01:11:43.738]  You're now very fake news.
[01:11:43.898 --> 01:11:44.078]  Okay.
[01:11:44.098 --> 01:11:46.278]  And he's making a joke and they all flip out about it.
[01:11:46.298 --> 01:11:46.958]  They can't handle it.
[01:11:46.998 --> 01:11:47.399]  They all flip.
[01:11:47.419 --> 01:11:50.719]  I will say this about these press conferences, and I'm sure other people have said it too.
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:56.701]  White House, you have to get some way that Donald Trump can hear the questions because... And our audience, too.
[01:11:56.781 --> 01:11:58.581]  You got a room with a lot of shutters clicking.
[01:11:58.962 --> 01:12:00.022]  You got all this stuff going on.
[01:12:00.042 --> 01:12:02.122]  You got people trying to jump up and ask questions.
[01:12:02.602 --> 01:12:03.903]  You got to get these people a microphone.
[01:12:03.923 --> 01:12:07.944]  You can have five interns in there getting people... I know this is a side issue, but
[01:12:08.544 --> 01:12:15.167]  If he can't hear the question, and he kind of sticks his foot in his mouth because he can't hear the question, he assumes he knows what the question is, it looks bad for everybody.
[01:12:15.527 --> 01:12:19.629]  So at least do yourselves a favor and get some microphones in that room for these idiot reporters.
[01:12:19.809 --> 01:12:26.792]  And of course, you're alluding to the one man who was trying to ask him a question and he kind of cuts him off and says, okay, I get it, and he defends himself against anti-Semite.
[01:12:26.852 --> 01:12:32.654]  He heard the word anti-Semite, and that was the only word, because that's what the guy led off with, and he had a book of paragraph questions.
[01:12:32.674 --> 01:12:34.195]  But he said, I got an easy question.
[01:12:34.775 --> 01:12:35.075]  I don't know.
[01:12:51.532 --> 01:12:55.553]  Let me preface this question with a longer... Let me tell you my narrative.
[01:12:55.613 --> 01:12:57.594]  I wrote this book, Mr. President.
[01:12:57.614 --> 01:13:00.374]  Let me read from you my book before I get to you this question.
[01:13:01.315 --> 01:13:07.196]  But I do think that it would behoove not just President Trump, but also people that listen to these press conferences.
[01:13:07.516 --> 01:13:09.437]  Because when we play, I can't hear what they're asking.
[01:13:09.657 --> 01:13:12.497]  And there's so much good stuff in those questions that I think we're missing.
[01:13:13.078 --> 01:13:14.478]  So this is just, of course,
[01:13:15.078 --> 01:13:22.921]  One instance of the media exposing to you how they, I guess, want to essentially censor Donald Trump from getting you his perspective of things because they want to control it.
[01:13:23.281 --> 01:13:34.145]  But this is reaching the internet, folks, and this is why we decided to do this 13-hour broadcast, because AdRoll, that works with Google, has decided to cut some of our funding, cut some of our exposure.
[01:13:34.765 --> 01:13:37.146]  Cut some of our products from being sold out there on the internet.
[01:13:37.506 --> 01:13:40.506]  And this has reached also to GoFundMe.
[01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:42.647]  So we are now joined by Brittany Pettibone.
[01:13:42.987 --> 01:13:52.469]  She has been somebody that went on to GoFundMe, tried to get some funds there to get her podcast advanced to the next level, and she got shut down.
[01:13:52.569 --> 01:13:55.010]  So Brittany, tell us about your story.
[01:13:55.090 --> 01:14:01.111]  I know it's been covered in a lot of mainstream news outlets, but you quit doing interviews because you didn't feel that you were getting fair coverage.
[01:14:01.511 --> 01:14:04.876]  Tell me, what is your side of the story being censored by GoFundMe?
[01:14:06.004 --> 01:14:15.650]  Yeah, actually, I refused to do any mainstream media interviews regarding the GoFundMe because I didn't feel like they'd do me justice, and they didn't.
[01:14:15.810 --> 01:14:18.072]  I mean, I read the Associated Press and the Observer.
[01:14:18.092 --> 01:14:24.416]  The Observer never asked me for an interview, but the Associated Press did, and it was basically a hit piece, so I'm glad that I said no.
[01:14:24.756 --> 01:14:33.202]  But essentially what happened is I launched the GoFundMe just for $400 to get some podcast equipment because I was launching a podcast and
[01:14:34.042 --> 01:14:44.824]  Within 26 minutes of me launching this campaign, a man named Jed Legume, he's the editor-in-chief for ThinkProgress, he had found the GoFundMe and
[01:14:46.095 --> 01:14:56.961]  He tweeted GoFundMe over Twitter and said, you know, I think this podcast by a conspiracy theorist and white nationalist violates your terms of service.
[01:14:57.522 --> 01:15:11.470]  So, essentially, they reached out to Bobby Whitmore, who is the spokesperson for GoFundMe, and apparently he said that my campaign for my podcast, which is based around traditionalism, just, you know, talking about traditional values,
[01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:16.372]  He said that essentially that went against their terms of service for hate speech and discrimination.
[01:15:16.452 --> 01:15:20.734]  So I guess that's not allowed anymore to talk about traditional values.
[01:15:21.174 --> 01:15:25.696]  But my podcast, no, we intended to discriminate against anyone.
[01:15:26.236 --> 01:15:34.600]  I have people of different races and different ideologies, you know, all across the right wing that that are on the podcast.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.182]  And so but basically GoFundMe then took down my
[01:15:39.315 --> 01:15:45.837]  Within like an hour, they deleted my campaign, refunded all the money, and banned me permanently from using the service ever again.
[01:15:46.477 --> 01:15:48.498]  And so, it was just really interesting.
[01:15:48.518 --> 01:15:53.399]  About an hour after that, The Observer had come out with an article, and that, I mean, the fastest thing I've ever seen.
[01:15:54.159 --> 01:15:56.660]  And then a couple days later, the Associated Press did one.
[01:15:57.219 --> 01:16:02.421]  And this is with no proof, this is just, hey, you're a white nationalist, uh, we gotta cut you off.
[01:16:02.441 --> 01:16:06.223]  This is just some guy on Twitter just said, oh, by the way, white nationalists can't have it.
[01:16:06.303 --> 01:16:10.585]  Yeah, did they actually cite any exact example of something you've done or said?
[01:16:10.745 --> 01:16:12.786]  Or did they just quote traditionalists?
[01:16:13.823 --> 01:16:23.065]  No, they called me alt-right because I've appeared on a few alt-right podcasts and stuff, but I mean, that's the equivalent of saying if I ever go on CNN, then I support Hillary.
[01:16:23.365 --> 01:16:23.885]  You know what I mean?
[01:16:23.925 --> 01:16:34.167]  Just because I go on someone's podcast doesn't mean that I necessarily agree with all of their views in the same way that anytime I invite someone onto my podcast, I don't necessarily agree with all of their views.
[01:16:34.647 --> 01:16:37.008]  So, they call me alt-right and they call me white nationalist.
[01:16:37.068 --> 01:16:38.268]  I have no idea why.
[01:16:38.288 --> 01:16:39.829]  I mean, I've been called a Nazi as well.
[01:16:39.869 --> 01:16:40.409]  Oh, you know why.
[01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:41.509]  It's because you support Trump.
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:43.821]  That's all it is.
[01:16:43.861 --> 01:16:58.707]  To shut you down, to deplatform you, you know, because... Well, and I'm glad you brought that point up about CNN because I've used GoFundMe in the past to fund some of the things grassroots-wise to get myself to this point.
[01:16:58.727 --> 01:17:05.230]  In fact, if it wasn't for GoFundMe, I might not even be at this desk right now, all the people that helped support me when I was just getting started.
[01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:07.071]  And it's also funny because
[01:17:07.611 --> 01:17:14.214]  You know, GoFundMe takes about 10-15% of every dollar raised, so they're cutting their own funding there too.
[01:17:14.674 --> 01:17:22.357]  But moving one step further, and I don't know if you did any research into this, but just from my time looking at GoFundMe, there's all kinds of campaigns out there.
[01:17:22.677 --> 01:17:23.718]  I mean, anything!
[01:17:23.778 --> 01:17:26.399]  You can find almost anything that you want to fund on GoFundMe.
[01:17:26.419 --> 01:17:32.682]  Some of the craziest, wildest, wackiest stuff you can find out there, but specifically... I think the Cat Cafe Lady did a GoFundMe.
[01:17:32.742 --> 01:17:42.468]  Cat Cafe Lady might have been on there, but there's a lot of movements on there that come from the left as well, that are totally political movements, completely politicized, but they're just on the left.
[01:17:42.828 --> 01:17:48.551]  I'm just curious, have you done any research into that, or have you heard of anyone else being censored as you were?
[01:17:49.989 --> 01:17:55.631]  I know that another person I know that was having trouble was David Seaman, former journalist for Huffington Post.
[01:17:55.691 --> 01:18:02.193]  I don't think on GoFundMe, but PayPal kept freezing his money, and wouldn't until he would call them and make them release it.
[01:18:02.833 --> 01:18:06.554]  And then, but I'm not aware of other people being banned.
[01:18:06.574 --> 01:18:10.215]  Now, was he getting donations from PayPal, or why did PayPal get involved?
[01:18:10.996 --> 01:18:14.617]  Because he has been researching Pizzagate, which they don't like.
[01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:23.132]  Yes, but I'm just curious, because PayPal is just a third-party service that you can use for purchasing something from anywhere, essentially.
[01:18:23.253 --> 01:18:26.494]  eBay, Amazon, television subscriptions, anything.
[01:18:26.514 --> 01:18:28.814]  So I'm curious, was he getting funding?
[01:18:28.894 --> 01:18:30.695]  Were people donating to his PayPal account?
[01:18:30.715 --> 01:18:33.156]  Because that is one way you can get funding, is people donate to PayPal.
[01:18:33.516 --> 01:18:34.416]  Was that going on?
[01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:35.416]  Is that why he got cut off?
[01:18:35.456 --> 01:18:39.718]  Or did PayPal just follow him and say, hey, this guy uses our service, let's end that?
[01:18:41.095 --> 01:18:42.736]  Oh no, I believe people were donating to him.
[01:18:42.816 --> 01:18:42.996]  Okay.
[01:18:43.016 --> 01:18:45.338]  And so they freeze the funds a couple times.
[01:18:46.019 --> 01:18:55.085]  And yeah, I mean, they basically, they say that according to their terms of service, I know on GoFundMe, they can ban you for any reason.
[01:18:55.125 --> 01:18:56.486]  You know, it's very subjective.
[01:18:56.527 --> 01:18:59.629]  Like I declare this hate speech or this is discrimination.
[01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:04.572]  Whereas something that we would regard as discrimination, they would let fly because they don't.
[01:19:04.713 --> 01:19:05.974]  So it's just all very subjective.
[01:19:06.014 --> 01:19:10.237]  But I felt that I was deliberately targeted with this because of my political views.
[01:19:10.977 --> 01:19:14.038]  Um, yeah, it wasn't, uh, it was deliberate.
[01:19:14.058 --> 01:19:15.198]  It felt, yeah, very personal.
[01:19:15.218 --> 01:19:16.258]  So I was shocked.
[01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:18.399]  I had never heard of this man before, Judd LeGum.
[01:19:18.419 --> 01:19:23.080]  Um, someone actually, um, brought it to my attention, uh, the tweet.
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:24.900]  And I was like, oh my gosh, who is this creepy guy?
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:27.881]  This really shows the danger of these online monopolies.
[01:19:27.921 --> 01:19:30.702]  Like PayPal has kind of taken over online paying.
[01:19:31.122 --> 01:19:32.522]  GoFundMe is kind of the one place.
[01:19:32.542 --> 01:19:35.963]  There's others, but they're, these guys are the kind of the leaders and they get to this spot.
[01:19:35.983 --> 01:19:37.123]  Like Google with SEOs.
[01:19:37.343 --> 01:19:37.783]  Exactly.
[01:19:37.823 --> 01:19:40.184]  Google, Google's the biggest thing out there right now.
[01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:43.407]  And what they do is that once they get their monopoly, then they start Facebook.
[01:19:43.667 --> 01:19:50.493]  Then they start saying, oh, we're going to limit the things that we don't like based on whatever our culture decides to be or what our CEO's culture is.
[01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:53.175]  And it's not about freedom of speech or freedom of expression.
[01:19:53.496 --> 01:19:58.100]  It's just about cutting people off that we don't like in hopes of pushing their ideas down.
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.301]  And it's not about debate.
[01:19:59.601 --> 01:20:02.464]  Because when you ask these people to debate, which you've done many times,
[01:20:04.947 --> 01:20:12.790]  You get the same story, backed with no evidence, and we saw this with the Tucker Carlson clip that Paul Joseph Watson played earlier.
[01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:13.250]  That was terrible.
[01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:18.593]  He's got the same talking points that everyone else has, like, Donald Trump is literally going to blow up the planet.
[01:20:20.467 --> 01:20:24.248]  None of this stuff is based on real reason at all, whatsoever.
[01:20:24.268 --> 01:20:27.769]  And, I'd like to point out, Donald Trump was talking about what's going on in Sweden.
[01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:30.050]  Two days after he says it, they have riots.
[01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:33.111]  Now there's a chemical attack at a train station.
[01:20:33.451 --> 01:20:35.872]  A man discharges noxious chemicals into a subway car.
[01:20:36.312 --> 01:20:41.934]  Okay, it's like he's from the future, or he can predict the future, and people like Chris Cuomo can't take it.
[01:20:42.614 --> 01:20:47.996]  And what you just alluded to, Rob, is how there's such a centralization of power with, you know,
[01:20:49.036 --> 01:20:49.356]  I think so.
[01:21:07.304 --> 01:21:12.910]  You know, that's how they're going to start censoring the world, especially now that the world is moving towards such a digital platform.
[01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:14.031]  Everything's digital now.
[01:21:14.371 --> 01:21:24.141]  They can very easily make these blanket algorithms, make these blanket censorship movements to just stop an entire group of people from voice being heard.
[01:21:24.621 --> 01:21:26.804]  And I think that that's what's going on here, Brittany, because
[01:21:27.364 --> 01:21:32.226]  We're getting censored, essentially, by AdRoll, Google, they want to stop our message, they want to stop this.
[01:21:32.246 --> 01:21:34.507]  Now you're being censored by GoFundMe.
[01:21:34.527 --> 01:21:37.328]  So it's like the same kind of dynamic here, all working together.
[01:21:38.828 --> 01:21:39.789]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:21:40.309 --> 01:21:46.351]  And I mean, I know there are certain people who would like to start alternatives to, I know WeSearcher is one, like to GoFundMe.
[01:21:46.391 --> 01:21:53.554]  The difficulty is because we're being labeled Nazis and white supremacists and, you know, white nationalists by these people without any evidence, mind you.
[01:21:54.794 --> 01:21:59.739]  Well, I know that you've gotten obviously very popular on Twitter over this campaign cycle.
[01:21:59.759 --> 01:22:02.322]  I think you've got over 50,000 Twitter followers now.
[01:22:17.958 --> 01:22:19.840]  I don't think they're going to completely stop you.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:26.549]  They may have stymied you for the moment, but just curious, what are your plans for the future as far as getting your podcast going, just so people can know?
[01:22:27.845 --> 01:22:30.087]  My podcast, I actually have already started.
[01:22:30.267 --> 01:22:32.408]  It's on SoundCloud, but it's also on YouTube.
[01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:33.169]  I have videos.
[01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:36.771]  So my channel is just Brittany Pettibone, and I've had three guests so far.
[01:22:36.891 --> 01:22:38.852]  One of, like, Tommy Robinson, Lauren Southern.
[01:22:39.593 --> 01:22:40.753]  So some great guests so far.
[01:22:41.254 --> 01:22:42.034]  It's been wonderful.
[01:22:42.074 --> 01:22:48.478]  So that, and then I'm also, I'll continue writing, working on our second book, Verdict Day, with my twin sister, Nicole.
[01:22:48.999 --> 01:22:51.981]  And so those are my projects for the foreseeable future.
[01:22:52.864 --> 01:22:54.305]  Alright, well we're in this together.
[01:22:54.425 --> 01:22:58.548]  You're getting censored, we're getting censored, and it's all because, and it's just beyond Trump.
[01:22:58.608 --> 01:23:01.590]  We do support Trump, but really we just want to red pill the world.
[01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:02.871]  I think that's what it comes down to.
[01:23:03.071 --> 01:23:03.932]  And it's all coordinated.
[01:23:04.132 --> 01:23:06.574]  These attacks are all coordinated to happen all at the same time.
[01:23:07.435 --> 01:23:09.296]  For a chilling effect, definitely.
[01:23:09.556 --> 01:23:10.277]  Thanks for joining us, Brittany.
[01:23:10.297 --> 01:23:10.897]  Thank you, Brittany.
[01:23:10.917 --> 01:23:11.978]  Thanks so much.
[01:23:12.418 --> 01:23:16.261]  So, and again, you know, like you were saying, Rob, it's all tied together.
[01:23:16.501 --> 01:23:17.522]  Yeah.
[01:23:17.642 --> 01:23:25.608]  This doesn't just happen by coincidence in such a shrunken period of time, especially considering what happened with Donald Trump.
[01:23:25.928 --> 01:23:31.232]  Now, see, if they were doing this with Hillary Clinton as president, it would be even more extreme.
[01:23:31.692 --> 01:23:33.854]  The teeth would be showing on this deal.
[01:23:34.174 --> 01:23:37.696]  But because it's Donald Trump, they can't really do it via the White House.
[01:23:37.716 --> 01:23:39.458]  They can't really do it via legislation.
[01:23:39.898 --> 01:23:44.561]  So all they have to do is use the companies that are under the umbrella to try to do it in the digital world.
[01:23:44.581 --> 01:23:47.864]  The companies that support the agenda of shutting down free speech.
[01:23:47.884 --> 01:23:49.705]  And that's the agenda of Google.
[01:23:49.985 --> 01:23:51.326]  That's the agenda of Facebook.
[01:23:52.807 --> 01:23:57.491]  Zuckerberg put out his manifesto and it is basically to get rid of objective journalism.
[01:23:57.771 --> 01:24:03.256]  Or to get rid of anybody questioning the known liars, which are the mainstream media and the establishment.
[01:24:03.276 --> 01:24:12.786]  And when I say establishment, I don't mean Donald Trump as the establishment, because he's just getting into office and he's not... I don't think he's really had a chance to show what he can really do in office at this time.
[01:24:12.806 --> 01:24:15.628]  Well, and he's got so much backlash from within, too.
[01:24:15.729 --> 01:24:19.953]  I mean, he's not even free to really operate, I think, the White House as he would like done.
[01:24:20.914 --> 01:24:21.614]  I totally agree.
[01:24:21.834 --> 01:24:25.395]  Hey, we're going to go to calls here in a second, so I want to give out the call number.
[01:24:26.315 --> 01:24:29.456]  It is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:24:29.476 --> 01:24:30.456]  877-789-2539.
[01:24:30.676 --> 01:24:36.398]  We're going to open up those call banks now, and we'll take your calls in just a little bit.
[01:24:36.998 --> 01:24:42.359]  I'd like to go over a couple of these articles concerning with our southern border.
[01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:48.551]  One of which is Sanctuary City lawmaker lets gang members walk free from Rikers Island.
[01:24:48.571 --> 01:24:55.952]  So this is an illegal immigrant gang member from El Salvador is allowed to walk free from Rikers Island under Mayor Bill de Blasio's Sanctuary City law.
[01:24:56.532 --> 01:24:58.753]  So this is over in New York, Rikers Island.
[01:24:59.753 --> 01:25:07.674]  We have our sheriff here in Austin, Texas, who was basically not holding people for ice.
[01:25:08.354 --> 01:25:12.715]  One of the people that she was not going to hold for ice was a man who had raped a six-year-old girl.
[01:25:14.159 --> 01:25:16.902]  And that's not under her killing of people.
[01:25:16.962 --> 01:25:18.703]  If they kill somebody, we're gonna hold them.
[01:25:18.963 --> 01:25:21.506]  But if they rape a six-year-old girl, we're gonna let them go.
[01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:26.530]  Because that would be, you know, we don't want, you know, if he goes out and rapes again, that's not the worst thing ever.
[01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:28.452]  Oh yeah, no, at least he's not killing anybody.
[01:25:28.592 --> 01:25:28.792]  Yeah.
[01:25:29.273 --> 01:25:31.635]  Total, total retard-ville, I'll just say it.
[01:25:31.915 --> 01:25:33.196]  No, that's beyond.
[01:25:33.436 --> 01:25:33.977]  Here's another one.
[01:25:34.097 --> 01:25:38.201]  Arizona Sheriff releasing 400 criminal illegal immigrants every 10 days.
[01:25:40.003 --> 01:25:43.564]  And I think that's the sheriff who took over Maricopa County.
[01:25:43.884 --> 01:25:45.344]  That's Paul Pinzone.
[01:25:45.884 --> 01:25:48.705]  So they put a lot of money into getting out Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[01:25:49.285 --> 01:25:52.405]  And now it's paying dividends for him because they're releasing criminals.
[01:25:52.745 --> 01:25:54.926]  Because that's the kind of society we want to live in.
[01:25:55.306 --> 01:25:58.066]  We don't want to be discriminatory against the criminals.
[01:25:58.806 --> 01:26:00.047]  Why would we want to do that?
[01:26:00.467 --> 01:26:03.507]  Why would we want to tell the criminals they're not allowed to live in our country?
[01:26:03.807 --> 01:26:06.588]  This is what frustrates me so much, Rob, because
[01:26:08.126 --> 01:26:27.948]  If we try, and you alluded to this earlier, if we go out on the streets, we've done this together, and if we try to talk to the protesters, specifically just on the issue of immigration, okay, Donald Trump's a racist, he wants to build a wall, he wants, you know, tougher immigration laws, really he wants to make immigration easier, he just wants to make it impossible to be an illegal immigrant, he wants to make it impossible to be a non-citizen here.
[01:26:29.431 --> 01:26:36.974]  But you talk about these stories, you can bring to them dozens and dozens of stories like, look, here's how these policies have affected Europe.
[01:26:37.415 --> 01:26:39.476]  Here's how these policies are affecting us here.
[01:26:39.816 --> 01:26:42.117]  Here's what Donald Trump is alluding to with the open borders.
[01:26:42.417 --> 01:26:45.618]  Here's what Donald Trump is alluding to with illegal immigrants acting violently, raping people.
[01:26:45.638 --> 01:26:47.239]  And it's like they have this wax coat on him and it just slips right off.
[01:26:47.259 --> 01:26:47.499]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:47.519 --> 01:26:47.939]  I'm not hearing that.
[01:26:47.959 --> 01:26:48.320]  I'm not listening.
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:55.623]  La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
[01:26:55.783 --> 01:26:58.006]  Flailing around, not listening, not listening.
[01:26:58.026 --> 01:26:59.468]  But here's what's scary about it, Rob.
[01:26:59.688 --> 01:27:00.670]  Here's what's scary about it.
[01:27:01.551 --> 01:27:02.833]  We have the information.
[01:27:03.093 --> 01:27:03.754]  You shared it.
[01:27:03.814 --> 01:27:04.715]  We know the articles.
[01:27:04.755 --> 01:27:06.037]  We know this information is out there.
[01:27:06.057 --> 01:27:07.739]  But what we're starting to see...
[01:27:09.474 --> 01:27:09.734]  That's
[01:27:28.263 --> 01:27:32.844]  Rob here is telling you about all these criminal, illegal immigrants that are coming here.
[01:27:32.904 --> 01:27:37.205]  They've raped people, they're being let go from the sanctuary cities, they're being let to roam the country.
[01:27:37.445 --> 01:27:46.247]  So we cover this, we try to bring this to the front as a political issue, as something that we can debate, try to have a conversation on as to what policies we need to move forward with.
[01:27:46.807 --> 01:27:47.927]  Oh, but what's the problem?
[01:27:48.767 --> 01:27:50.588]  These people are never going to hear this.
[01:27:51.624 --> 01:27:56.705]  And then, if they go on Google and they search, well, you know what, maybe he just opened my mind a little bit.
[01:27:57.085 --> 01:27:58.525]  Maybe I'll see if this is true.
[01:27:58.586 --> 01:27:59.186]  They type it in.
[01:27:59.206 --> 01:27:59.706]  Illegal immigrants.
[01:27:59.726 --> 01:28:00.406]  I'm going to fact check him.
[01:28:00.446 --> 01:28:01.486]  Yeah, I'm going to fact check him.
[01:28:01.566 --> 01:28:02.746]  Illegal immigrants killing people.
[01:28:02.786 --> 01:28:03.307]  What are they going to get?
[01:28:03.647 --> 01:28:07.487]  Snopes, PolitiFact, Washington Times, New York Times, Washington Post.
[01:28:07.507 --> 01:28:09.748]  They're going to get the establishment articles up there.
[01:28:09.768 --> 01:28:10.888]  These are dreamers.
[01:28:10.908 --> 01:28:12.308]  They want to come here for a better life.
[01:28:12.328 --> 01:28:13.629]  They're not going to see Judicial Watch.
[01:28:13.649 --> 01:28:14.669]  They're not going to see Breitbart.
[01:28:14.689 --> 01:28:15.989]  They're not going to see Infowars.
[01:28:16.029 --> 01:28:17.490]  So now they're controlling the information.
[01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:19.290]  It's full spectrum control.
[01:28:19.650 --> 01:28:22.051]  By the way, this is a Judicial Watch article that you're talking about.
[01:28:22.091 --> 01:28:26.193]  The Arizona Sheriff releasing 400 illegal immigrants every 10 days.
[01:28:26.554 --> 01:28:27.394]  Just every 10 days.
[01:28:27.434 --> 01:28:28.935]  And Judicial Watch is non-partisan.
[01:28:29.375 --> 01:28:32.137]  And these are the criminal ones, okay?
[01:28:32.477 --> 01:28:37.780]  And, you know, Trump had his press... Spicer was having the press conference yesterday talking about Trump's new immigration plan.
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:38.800]  He's going to try 2.0.
[01:28:39.581 --> 01:28:44.543]  And all the people were just talking about, you know, oh, how can he go after these people?
[01:28:44.583 --> 01:28:45.584]  He goes, listen, listen, listen.
[01:28:46.311 --> 01:28:49.832]  If there's any other country out there and you're here illegally, they deport you.
[01:28:50.172 --> 01:28:51.012]  That's how it works.
[01:28:51.092 --> 01:28:52.693]  Or if you walk across the border!
[01:28:52.773 --> 01:28:53.013]  Yeah!
[01:28:53.413 --> 01:28:58.154]  It's like, you don't just get to go into any other country anywhere else in the world and go, hey, I want everything you have.
[01:28:58.394 --> 01:28:59.214]  And you know what they say?
[01:28:59.354 --> 01:29:02.455]  When I bring that to them, I say, hey, can you go to Mexico and vote?
[01:29:02.595 --> 01:29:05.436]  Can you walk over the border in, you know, whatever country, country X?
[01:29:05.516 --> 01:29:06.896]  And you know what they say every time?
[01:29:07.217 --> 01:29:07.977]  Well, I wouldn't want to.
[01:29:07.997 --> 01:29:08.617]  Well, why is that?
[01:29:08.857 --> 01:29:10.558]  Because America's the greatest country in the world.
[01:29:10.978 --> 01:29:11.098]  Oh.
[01:29:11.878 --> 01:29:11.999]  Oh!
[01:29:12.119 --> 01:29:14.460]  So now you understand why we want to protect it!
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:15.740]  Wow!
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:17.121]  You're thinking!
[01:29:17.141 --> 01:29:18.562]  Oh, that's amazing.
[01:29:18.622 --> 01:29:22.083]  And he's also talking about making the process of legal immigration easier.
[01:29:22.223 --> 01:29:24.004]  Because it is kind of hard to get in here illegally.
[01:29:24.024 --> 01:29:24.764]  It takes many years.
[01:29:25.105 --> 01:29:32.868]  I talked to a lot of Trump supporters, though, that were newly created citizens, or newly, I guess, they take their pledge, newly pledged citizens.
[01:29:33.329 --> 01:29:34.429]  They got their citizenship.
[01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:36.070]  They said it took seven or eight years.
[01:29:36.610 --> 01:29:41.039]  It took a lot of money, but they did it the right way, and they really wanted to be a citizen.
[01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:42.883]  And now their family has a future.
[01:29:43.264 --> 01:29:43.785]  Exactly.
[01:29:44.105 --> 01:29:46.430]  And I have no problem with people wanting to do it the right way.
[01:29:47.694 --> 01:29:49.976]  There's plenty of room for people who want to do it the right way.
[01:29:50.256 --> 01:29:56.640]  But if you're going to come in here, you're going to take a social security number, take an IEN number and use that as your social security number, you're breaking the law.
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:57.621]  You're a criminal.
[01:29:57.681 --> 01:29:58.121]  I'm sorry.
[01:29:58.901 --> 01:30:01.963]  If I didn't pay my taxes, they would take me away from my family.
[01:30:02.164 --> 01:30:08.528]  They wouldn't say, well, you know, that's a law that you kind of, we're a sanctuary tax city, so you don't have to pay your taxes.
[01:30:08.548 --> 01:30:12.570]  I don't see any of those springing up anywhere in the United States saying you don't have to pay your income tax.
[01:30:12.811 --> 01:30:16.413]  But if I didn't pay my income tax, they would take me away from my family and put me in jail.
[01:30:16.573 --> 01:30:22.155]  I bet if your name was Juan Pablo from Honduras, for some reason, I think that you might not have to deal with that.
[01:30:22.175 --> 01:30:23.515]  Well, you probably don't have to pay taxes.
[01:30:23.875 --> 01:30:26.756]  And they go, oh, they pay taxes and they don't get them back at the end of the year.
[01:30:27.116 --> 01:30:27.916]  Not my problem!
[01:30:28.056 --> 01:30:30.037]  Not my problem, you're illegal!
[01:30:30.397 --> 01:30:36.999]  Here's the crazy thing about it too, Rob, is it's like, when will the reality of this...
[01:30:38.604 --> 01:30:40.706]  They want people to come here because they feel bad.
[01:30:40.746 --> 01:30:41.086]  You know what?
[01:30:41.226 --> 01:30:41.767]  I'm sorry.
[01:30:41.787 --> 01:30:42.948]  I feel bad too.
[01:30:43.668 --> 01:30:46.631]  I don't want people to grow up in a third-world country with no future.
[01:30:46.671 --> 01:30:52.275]  I don't want people to grow up just trying to hide in a shelter because a bomb might get dropped over their head every day.
[01:30:52.295 --> 01:30:53.236]  That's not what I want.
[01:30:53.276 --> 01:30:54.017]  That's terrible.
[01:30:54.057 --> 01:30:54.537]  That's awful.
[01:30:54.757 --> 01:30:57.700]  And I don't even understand how some of our foreign policy is responsible for that.
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:04.986]  However, think about the logic here, Rob, because this is truly their mindset, and I think that you would agree with this.
[01:31:05.956 --> 01:31:07.838]  You say, OK, how is this going to go?
[01:31:08.118 --> 01:31:11.361]  If we open the border, if we let all these people in, what are they going to do?
[01:31:11.501 --> 01:31:12.662]  What is the same thing they say?
[01:31:12.762 --> 01:31:13.823]  Oh, well, the rich are going to pay for it.
[01:31:14.283 --> 01:31:15.284]  Oh, we'll just tax the rich.
[01:31:15.344 --> 01:31:15.905]  Tax the rich.
[01:31:16.205 --> 01:31:17.807]  Do you know how that works?
[01:31:18.327 --> 01:31:20.189]  Have you ever heard of tax exemptions?
[01:31:20.429 --> 01:31:23.191]  Do you know that the rich, most of them, don't even pay taxes?
[01:31:23.852 --> 01:31:30.118]  So it's like this crazy world that they live in where they just think everything they think will just become true.
[01:31:30.618 --> 01:31:30.798]  Yeah.
[01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:32.160]  It's like, no, guess what?
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:36.404]  The rich aren't going to pay the taxes to fund all the illegals coming here.
[01:31:36.585 --> 01:31:40.669]  They're going to take your taxes and then your city's infrastructure is going to collapse.
[01:31:40.689 --> 01:31:41.570]  And that's what's been going on.
[01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:42.952]  They're going to raise your property taxes.
[01:31:43.012 --> 01:31:45.294]  They're going to raise your little small fee taxes.
[01:31:45.334 --> 01:31:50.100]  All the little taxes that these sanctuary cities impose to pay for these programs because
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.322]  The City Council's not going to pay for it themselves.
[01:31:53.822 --> 01:31:55.664]  The City Manager's not going to pay for it themselves.
[01:31:55.944 --> 01:31:57.325]  They're going to take it from you.
[01:31:57.706 --> 01:31:58.967]  And that's the secret.
[01:31:59.047 --> 01:32:04.332]  They take it from you, and little hidden taxes every which way, and go, we're going to use these to fund these programs.
[01:32:04.652 --> 01:32:08.135]  Because we want to have this type of voting block in here because we know they'll keep us in power.
[01:32:09.076 --> 01:32:10.977]  Here's a story that the team just pulled up.
[01:32:11.618 --> 01:32:13.420]  6.1 million illegals filed taxes in the U.S.
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.922]  Many didn't pay but received refunds.
[01:32:15.962 --> 01:32:16.622]  How do you like that?
[01:32:16.943 --> 01:32:18.104]  So it's like, exactly!
[01:32:19.564 --> 01:32:27.772]  But this is the news that they're never going to see and eventually I think all of the SEOs, like Google, are just going to completely bury from the results.
[01:32:27.832 --> 01:32:30.314]  I think that they're kind of, right now they're testing it.
[01:32:30.794 --> 01:32:33.937]  It's kind of a soft test right now to see what they can get away with.
[01:32:34.297 --> 01:32:40.423]  Slowly and surely they're going to implement these policies and you're not going to see any news like that on Google.
[01:32:40.743 --> 01:32:43.606]  And you know who I... Well a couple years ago they did pull us off the news section.
[01:32:43.846 --> 01:32:44.827]  Unless you type us in.
[01:32:45.367 --> 01:32:45.567]  No.
[01:32:46.828 --> 01:32:48.189]  And it could be a story we broke.
[01:32:48.549 --> 01:32:50.911]  People could be linking back to us because we were the source.
[01:32:52.012 --> 01:32:52.972]  Nah, not news.
[01:32:53.232 --> 01:32:53.713]  Not news.
[01:32:53.933 --> 01:32:54.653]  They just decide.
[01:32:55.634 --> 01:32:56.935]  You know, and I forget who it was.
[01:32:57.756 --> 01:33:04.000]  Someone was on with Alex yesterday, it may have been Corsi or Steele, saying we need a new internet.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:05.621]  I think he's absolutely right.
[01:33:06.021 --> 01:33:06.702]  And I think it was
[01:33:08.041 --> 01:33:13.446]  John McAfee that said he wanted to make a new internet on the Alex Jones Show just a couple years ago.
[01:33:13.886 --> 01:33:15.908]  I certainly don't have the capacity to make a new internet.
[01:33:15.968 --> 01:33:17.789]  I don't have the capacity to make a new SEO.
[01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:19.751]  I don't have the capacity to make a new Facebook.
[01:33:19.771 --> 01:33:22.413]  But someone out there in the Patriot Movement does.
[01:33:22.894 --> 01:33:23.414]  I would imagine.
[01:33:23.434 --> 01:33:24.455]  There are millions of us.
[01:33:25.016 --> 01:33:28.759]  It's time to take action because I really think that that ultimately is the only thing we can do.
[01:33:29.159 --> 01:33:31.321]  Google has completely blocked InfoWars.
[01:33:31.501 --> 01:33:32.502]  Can you bring that back up guys?
[01:33:32.522 --> 01:33:34.064]  Pull that story back up for us guys.
[01:33:34.604 --> 01:33:35.385]  The team is trying to
[01:33:36.516 --> 01:33:36.836]  We're good.
[01:33:58.579 --> 01:34:01.221]  Is the same thing that Drudge talks about, the same thing that Jones did.
[01:34:01.241 --> 01:34:05.043]  You just have to make your own everything, essentially.
[01:34:05.103 --> 01:34:06.844]  You have to get out of the internet ghetto.
[01:34:06.884 --> 01:34:07.304]  Just remove it.
[01:34:07.324 --> 01:34:07.504]  Exactly.
[01:34:07.544 --> 01:34:09.945]  Which is what Google is, which is what Facebook is.
[01:34:10.165 --> 01:34:11.606]  Twitter's even an internet ghetto.
[01:34:12.287 --> 01:34:13.447]  Now there's Gab AI.
[01:34:13.807 --> 01:34:16.249]  That's a new form of Twitter that's out there.
[01:34:16.389 --> 01:34:21.732]  And a lot of people, conservative, right-leaning, I guess pro-Trump people are on there now.
[01:34:21.752 --> 01:34:22.752]  I think it was started by a pro-Trump person.
[01:34:22.772 --> 01:34:25.154]  Well, it's all the people that got wiped off Twitter.
[01:34:25.194 --> 01:34:26.274]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:34:26.294 --> 01:34:27.355]  So, of course, it's all Trump people.
[01:34:27.435 --> 01:34:28.596]  Hey guys, pull up that call screen.
[01:34:28.636 --> 01:34:29.596]  Let's take some calls now.
[01:34:29.616 --> 01:34:36.540]  We've got about less than 30 minutes left, and we are not quite halfway through the 13 hours of the Defense of Liberty broadcast.
[01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:40.502]  And now we have some amazing specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:40.522 --> 01:34:43.503]  We've got Silver Bullet, 33% off the stock price.
[01:34:43.543 --> 01:34:45.384]  Supermail Vitality, 25% off its price.
[01:34:45.424 --> 01:34:46.965]  Brain Force Plus, 25% off.
[01:34:47.025 --> 01:34:47.625]  Survival Shield, 25% off.
[01:34:47.645 --> 01:34:49.146]  Caveman, that's our new protein powder.
[01:34:57.370 --> 01:35:15.015]  If you took, like, two chicken bone broths and, like, squeezed them into a can, that's kind of the equivalent of what it would be if you were to make... If you've ever made real chicken noodle soup with bone broth, it's basically that put into a canister with some turmeric, a few other things, and it's, of course, it's freeze-dried and powdery.
[01:35:15.495 --> 01:35:16.875]  But you mix it with milk, mix it with water.
[01:35:16.955 --> 01:35:17.676]  I've had it both ways.
[01:35:17.716 --> 01:35:18.796]  I think it's great either way.
[01:35:19.476 --> 01:35:20.596]  But check it out, Caveman.
[01:35:21.077 --> 01:35:22.257]  It's one of our newest products.
[01:35:22.277 --> 01:35:24.417]  We also have the Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan lithographs. $19.95.
[01:35:26.758 --> 01:35:30.941]  And that Ronald Reagan is very rare, and we're not going to have too many of those.
[01:35:30.961 --> 01:35:35.525]  I think we've got less than a thousand of those Ronald Reagan ones, so I'm sure they're going to be gone soon.
[01:35:35.905 --> 01:35:44.532]  And also, the biggest deal, a free Alexa Pure water filtration system when you buy a three-month supply of InfoWars Select storable food.
[01:35:45.152 --> 01:35:47.594]  Three-month supply, you get food and you get water.
[01:35:48.635 --> 01:35:52.518]  And you could use this water you collect off the side of your house, you could put it through these filters.
[01:35:53.257 --> 01:35:54.398]  With rainwater gathering.
[01:35:54.638 --> 01:36:06.404]  And that's probably the way to go in times where the power's cut off from your city or there's massive civil unrest, which could happen at any time, especially with what's going on with these paid protesters.
[01:36:06.784 --> 01:36:10.106]  So let's go to our first caller, Jesse in Texas.
[01:36:10.706 --> 01:36:11.747]  Jesse, go ahead.
[01:36:11.767 --> 01:36:12.347]  How you doing today?
[01:36:13.628 --> 01:36:13.868]  Good.
[01:36:14.508 --> 01:36:15.029]  How are you?
[01:36:15.589 --> 01:36:16.129]  I'm doing great.
[01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.530]  Go ahead.
[01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:20.652]  I was just calling to talk about, I guess, the whole thing with
[01:36:22.416 --> 01:36:26.118]  What's going on with Milo and the other attacks that are going on right now?
[01:36:26.198 --> 01:36:35.844]  I think it's... I mean, with Milo, he's being attacked from both sides right now, and it's really... I mean, I've read through lots of comments on the Internet and other things.
[01:36:35.924 --> 01:36:49.231]  It seems like most people just read headlines on both sides, but, I mean, it seems like the left a lot more will read the headlines or take third-party information and then present it as absolute facts in more cases than just Milo.
[01:36:49.251 --> 01:36:50.312]  I mean, it happens all the time.
[01:36:50.771 --> 01:37:01.106]  You see it everywhere and I just think it's pretty, it's just sad to see the state of our country right now.
[01:37:01.126 --> 01:37:02.748]  It is shocking.
[01:37:02.948 --> 01:37:03.910]  It's almost unbelievable.
[01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:06.714]  Like you can't even, you can't even really fully
[01:37:08.075 --> 01:37:11.556]  Appreciate how dramatic it actually is, the censoring right now.
[01:37:11.836 --> 01:37:15.757]  Yeah, taking, you know, in Milo's case, taking something completely out of context.
[01:37:16.337 --> 01:37:20.418]  And I don't, I don't agree with, you know, some of what Milo says.
[01:37:20.658 --> 01:37:22.359]  The stuff on free speech, I think he's dead on.
[01:37:22.619 --> 01:37:32.901]  The stuff about the social justice warriors, you know, he does go out there and try to incite these people, which I think, you know, he's dealing with people who aren't playing with a full deck, so he's going to get those reactions.
[01:37:33.601 --> 01:37:35.362]  And sometimes I'm like, are we doing
[01:37:36.633 --> 01:37:37.634]  That would be my only criticism.
[01:37:37.714 --> 01:37:39.335]  Are we doing good by provoking these people?
[01:37:41.076 --> 01:37:42.817]  You know, they should be old enough to act their age.
[01:37:43.558 --> 01:37:50.642]  And sometimes it is fun provoking these people because they do sound like witless individuals.
[01:37:50.782 --> 01:37:56.486]  I'm not comparing the gravity of what Milo is doing or the seriousness of what Milo is doing to Martin Luther King, certainly.
[01:37:56.606 --> 01:38:01.550]  But there is a bit of a comparison here because the reason why Martin Luther King was so powerful
[01:38:02.150 --> 01:38:07.958]  The reason why Martin Luther King was so successful because all he had to do to prove his point was walk on the street.
[01:38:08.599 --> 01:38:08.939]  That's it.
[01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:12.784]  All he had to do was say, hey, I've got my black brothers and sisters here.
[01:38:13.245 --> 01:38:15.848]  You don't think that we're being hated on?
[01:38:15.868 --> 01:38:18.071]  You don't think that this is a racist country against us?
[01:38:18.112 --> 01:38:18.492]  Watch this.
[01:38:18.512 --> 01:38:19.794]  We're just going to walk right down the street.
[01:38:20.174 --> 01:38:21.134]  We're gonna cross a bridge.
[01:38:21.314 --> 01:38:22.115]  And what would happen?
[01:38:22.135 --> 01:38:26.676]  They'd have people spit on them, police would fire water cannons at them, they'd get beaten, they'd get arrested.
[01:38:26.957 --> 01:38:29.818]  So it was like, okay, Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:38:29.958 --> 01:38:30.418]  is right.
[01:38:30.498 --> 01:38:31.138]  He's right on.
[01:38:31.178 --> 01:38:32.679]  This is a very courageous and brave man.
[01:38:32.919 --> 01:38:33.739]  And he changed the world.
[01:38:34.199 --> 01:38:37.860]  So, in a way, that's kind of what Milo is doing.
[01:38:38.201 --> 01:38:39.701]  He goes and he does his tour.
[01:38:40.361 --> 01:38:41.542]  He shows up at a campus.
[01:38:42.242 --> 01:38:48.905]  Just to... These are supposed to be temples of free thought and free speech and open ideas.
[01:38:49.145 --> 01:38:49.825]  And what happens?
[01:38:50.926 --> 01:38:51.946]  They burn the campus!
[01:38:52.446 --> 01:38:53.086]  They riot!
[01:38:53.186 --> 01:38:53.967]  They protest!
[01:38:54.127 --> 01:38:55.067]  They censor him!
[01:38:55.727 --> 01:38:56.268]  So again...
[01:38:57.441 --> 01:39:04.323]  That's the most powerful form of proving your argument, when all you have to do is show up and watch the way your opposition responds.
[01:39:04.463 --> 01:39:09.805]  Well, and even more than him, it's the people that show up to see him, how they were treated, especially in Berkeley.
[01:39:10.065 --> 01:39:15.367]  Getting pepper sprayed, getting hit, one guy gets knocked out, hitting females.
[01:39:16.027 --> 01:39:17.847]  I mean, come on, that's the lowest form.
[01:39:17.867 --> 01:39:20.588]  Well, I guess to them, they don't know if it's a female.
[01:39:20.988 --> 01:39:21.929]  It could be.
[01:39:26.252 --> 01:39:31.616]  Showing where we've come, and you look at what, it's really a legacy that Obama left us.
[01:39:32.496 --> 01:39:42.903]  Of people all wanting to fight with each other so we're not looking at the real enemy, which is the globalists and the giant central multinational banks and these multinational corporations that love it when we fight.
[01:39:43.103 --> 01:39:46.646]  They can't, they love it, this is great to them, they're like, oh we'll keep on fighting.
[01:39:46.726 --> 01:39:48.207]  We love it, we love it.
[01:39:49.275 --> 01:39:49.595]  Probably.
[01:39:49.635 --> 01:39:49.975]  Maybe.
[01:39:50.075 --> 01:39:50.555]  I don't know.
[01:39:50.595 --> 01:39:52.156]  We're all being attacked here.
[01:39:52.556 --> 01:39:53.716]  We're all being censored left and right.
[01:39:53.736 --> 01:39:55.316]  And basically I think that's kind of what this is.
[01:39:55.336 --> 01:39:55.976]  But you have to look at
[01:40:12.386 --> 01:40:26.614]  I have to look at it this way, as they basically start to center everyone, they are pretty much showing their hand and saying that their remit don't want anybody or any free speech on anyone.
[01:40:27.174 --> 01:40:39.360]  And it's like what Alex Jones has already said, if they can take him, Breitbart, and another big name, I can't remember, they can take all down.
[01:40:41.989 --> 01:40:44.411]  Yeah, but I was looking for the judge report.
[01:40:44.571 --> 01:40:47.793]  Oh, the judge report, yeah.
[01:40:47.853 --> 01:40:51.115]  They might be showing their hand, but most people aren't seeing it.
[01:40:52.857 --> 01:40:54.958]  So, I mean, I think that you're right on.
[01:40:54.978 --> 01:40:56.039]  Yeah, they're showing their hand.
[01:40:56.079 --> 01:40:57.460]  We've known their hand for a long time.
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:58.520]  They've written about their hand.
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:40:59.841]  Their hand is pretty obvious to read.
[01:41:00.342 --> 01:41:01.262]  History repeats itself.
[01:41:01.302 --> 01:41:02.923]  You have free speech as long as you agree with us.
[01:41:03.144 --> 01:41:04.164]  That's their hand.
[01:41:04.545 --> 01:41:10.729]  But as much as they want to show their hand, you still have the people that are going to deny it because they're telling you that they're the dealer and they would never cheat.
[01:41:12.146 --> 01:41:12.666]  Right.
[01:41:12.686 --> 01:41:23.549]  Nah, except for the fact that I have a pledge to put in for a YouTube website.
[01:41:23.729 --> 01:41:25.909]  I mean, a YouTube channel I have out there.
[01:41:26.769 --> 01:41:28.570]  It's called the InfoWars Newslet.
[01:41:28.710 --> 01:41:30.390]  Please come to my channel.
[01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:37.292]  I mean, you can see what the attack is on Alex Jones and the rest of them, so please support
[01:41:37.901 --> 01:41:41.623]  But those that are trying to fight for human liberty and freedom, that is all.
[01:41:42.783 --> 01:41:43.383]  Thanks, O'Brien.
[01:41:43.403 --> 01:41:45.084]  Thanks for getting in the game, because that's what it takes.
[01:41:45.144 --> 01:41:46.265]  It takes lots of people.
[01:41:46.545 --> 01:41:54.749]  Even if you're going to grab Alex Jones videos, our videos that we make, and repost them on your site, you're probably not going to get the views that we get on the Alex Jones Channel.
[01:41:55.089 --> 01:41:59.791]  But you're making a dent, and you're showing people that, hey, I believe in this stuff.
[01:42:00.131 --> 01:42:01.352]  I see where this is going.
[01:42:01.712 --> 01:42:02.772]  You need to wake up, too.
[01:42:03.513 --> 01:42:05.393]  And it's funny, they're going to be showing
[01:42:06.914 --> 01:42:07.114]  I don't
[01:42:26.084 --> 01:42:28.726]  And yet he is 1984, he is Big Brother.
[01:42:29.386 --> 01:42:30.407]  It's weird.
[01:42:30.467 --> 01:42:33.129]  And I'm telling you, and maybe we'll try to do this actually.
[01:42:33.649 --> 01:42:39.713]  This might be harder to do since we've already done all the Trump protests, but there is a Trump march actually coming up on March 4th.
[01:42:39.913 --> 01:42:40.954]  It's March for Trump.
[01:42:41.054 --> 01:42:41.955]  That's right, March for Trump.
[01:42:42.455 --> 01:42:43.456]  Somebody sent this in to us.
[01:42:44.076 --> 01:42:52.499]  It's a grassroots pro-Trump organization that announces a nationwide march to show support for President Donald Trump and peacefully unite all people in honor of America.
[01:42:52.919 --> 01:42:54.779]  What first started out as a single march in Washington, D.C.
[01:42:54.799 --> 01:42:56.020]  has grown into a national movement.
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:58.701]  So they're going to be in Phoenix, Jefferson City, St.
[01:42:58.741 --> 01:43:05.303]  Paul, Raleigh, Las Vegas, Reno, Austin, Texas, Virginia Beach, and it's going to be all over the place.
[01:43:06.103 --> 01:43:09.144]  And it was basically started by an Air Force veteran.
[01:43:09.986 --> 01:43:11.328]  Name Vincent Haney.
[01:43:11.488 --> 01:43:17.415]  We have all these marches for pink pussies and all this other stuff.
[01:43:18.176 --> 01:43:22.701]  And so let's have a march against the nasty women.
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:30.903]  But I think, you know, we should embrace the nasty woman and try to show them the error of their ways as well, because these ladies were slapped by one of them.
[01:43:31.203 --> 01:43:31.784]  And multiples.
[01:43:31.904 --> 01:43:35.766]  Totally, totally... Out of their mind lunatics.
[01:43:35.986 --> 01:43:38.207]  Ignorant and clueless about what's really going on in the world.
[01:43:38.227 --> 01:43:38.287]  Sad.
[01:43:38.447 --> 01:43:38.647]  Yeah.
[01:43:39.027 --> 01:43:39.787]  Mind control slaves.
[01:43:40.268 --> 01:43:41.128]  Very, very sad.
[01:43:41.208 --> 01:43:41.988]  Alright, thanks O'Brien.
[01:43:42.008 --> 01:43:43.849]  Let's go to Kevin in Canada.
[01:43:43.869 --> 01:43:45.110]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:43:45.130 --> 01:43:46.210]  Hey guys.
[01:43:48.411 --> 01:43:49.712]  So, I was originally
[01:43:50.530 --> 01:43:55.592]  I'm going to speak about you guys are heading in the wrong direction as far as fighting against Google.
[01:43:56.112 --> 01:43:57.792]  But I'd rather ask you two questions.
[01:43:58.293 --> 01:44:01.434]  The first question I wanted to ask you has to do with Milo.
[01:44:03.214 --> 01:44:07.796]  If you saw a video... Did we lose him?
[01:44:08.276 --> 01:44:08.456]  What?
[01:44:09.824 --> 01:44:10.765]  How does that happen?
[01:44:10.865 --> 01:44:13.046]  Yeah, it sounded like he stepped on his phone or something.
[01:44:13.066 --> 01:44:13.707]  Alright, that's okay.
[01:44:13.727 --> 01:44:14.047]  You know what?
[01:44:14.087 --> 01:44:14.827]  He was from Canada.
[01:44:14.847 --> 01:44:16.348]  I don't know why he doesn't want us to fight Google.
[01:44:16.388 --> 01:44:18.650]  I had a feeling that that call was going in a strange direction anyway.
[01:44:18.850 --> 01:44:19.070]  Yeah.
[01:44:19.110 --> 01:44:19.571]  But you know what?
[01:44:19.591 --> 01:44:21.852]  Since he was in Canada, Rob, I want to talk about this story in Canada.
[01:44:21.912 --> 01:44:23.713]  Oh, but by the way, I wish I would have done this.
[01:44:24.374 --> 01:44:28.176]  I wish that all these Trump protests, I would have asked the Trump protesters, have you ever read 1984?
[01:44:28.216 --> 01:44:30.058]  Do you know who wrote 1984?
[01:44:30.698 --> 01:44:32.599]  My guess is most of them probably couldn't answer that.
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:34.661]  I bet if you go to this Trump rally, have you read 1984?
[01:44:34.721 --> 01:44:35.381]  Do you know?
[01:44:35.621 --> 01:44:36.602]  I bet they all read it.
[01:44:36.702 --> 01:44:36.842]  Oh yeah.
[01:44:36.882 --> 01:44:37.903]  They could all tell you the author.
[01:44:38.783 --> 01:44:40.704]  But I wanted to get this story out of Canada.
[01:44:41.484 --> 01:44:43.745]  This is actually out of the Toronto Star.
[01:44:44.685 --> 01:44:46.726]  Factors to consider about Sharia Law and M103.
[01:44:47.246 --> 01:44:48.406]  I don't know if you've heard about this.
[01:44:49.026 --> 01:44:51.567]  This is a proposed motion coming out of Canada.
[01:44:52.307 --> 01:44:53.408]  And I, look...
[01:44:55.311 --> 01:45:03.937]  People in Canada, actually, who are conservative, who will accept reality, make fun of themselves because Canada is now, like, the most cucked nation in the world.
[01:45:04.317 --> 01:45:05.458]  It's like a joke in Canada.
[01:45:05.779 --> 01:45:06.579]  Oh, nice to meet you.
[01:45:06.619 --> 01:45:07.080]  Sorry!
[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:11.183]  Like, they apologize after they meet you just in case they've offended you just by meeting you.
[01:45:11.523 --> 01:45:12.424]  But here's the story.
[01:45:13.359 --> 01:45:15.341]  There is no monolithic understanding of Sharia.
[01:45:15.381 --> 01:45:19.884]  There is a spectrum of interpretations ranging from the very liberal to the very extreme conservative.
[01:45:20.224 --> 01:45:22.046]  Oh, it's extreme conservative, but just liberal.
[01:45:22.526 --> 01:45:29.972]  The inherent diversity and pluralism of Sharia may be the best tool we have to counter the violent and anti-modern narratives of extremists.
[01:45:30.212 --> 01:45:31.513]  Whoa, how's that anti-modern?
[01:45:31.533 --> 01:45:33.475]  How is Sharia pro-modern?
[01:45:33.895 --> 01:45:36.779]  It just gets worse, Rob.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:38.281]  Go ahead.
[01:45:38.501 --> 01:45:39.002]  That hurts.
[01:45:39.102 --> 01:45:39.583]  Keep going.
[01:45:39.763 --> 01:45:40.584]  I got a headache now.
[01:45:41.185 --> 01:45:47.913]  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau smears all Canadians with Islamophobia lie to create a Sharia state.
[01:45:48.213 --> 01:45:51.237]  This is tweeted from Pamela Geller in reference to M103.
[01:45:52.879 --> 01:45:54.300]  A motion debated in Parliament this week.
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:46:02.364]  So, that's what, obviously, Pamela Geller has, she's an American journalist who's done a lot to talk about Sharia law, raise awareness for the Islamification of the West.
[01:46:02.384 --> 01:46:03.044]  What is the actual motion though?
[01:46:03.104 --> 01:46:03.665]  Read the motion.
[01:46:04.165 --> 01:46:05.086]  That has got to be great.
[01:46:05.126 --> 01:46:12.009]  So, the motion, I'll get to it here, but let's, this is the funny thing, because this comes from the Toronto Star.
[01:46:12.049 --> 01:46:12.850]  So here you go, Rob.
[01:46:13.650 --> 01:46:23.147]  It's not a bill, it's a non-binding motion asking the government to study systemic racism and religious discrimination.
[01:46:24.966 --> 01:46:25.266]  Okay.
[01:46:25.647 --> 01:46:27.689]  So they're not letting them set up churches in Canada.
[01:46:27.789 --> 01:46:28.910]  Or mosques, I guess.
[01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.850]  Bingo!
[01:46:30.371 --> 01:46:31.352]  I guess that's going on.
[01:46:31.732 --> 01:46:32.493]  Oh wait, no it's not.
[01:46:32.733 --> 01:46:34.174]  No, there's mosques everywhere in Canada.
[01:46:34.234 --> 01:46:36.957]  Oh wait, have they stopped Muslims from coming into the country?
[01:46:36.997 --> 01:46:37.998]  No, they're inviting more in.
[01:46:38.358 --> 01:46:39.519]  Oh, okay, okay.
[01:46:39.799 --> 01:46:41.281]  So, I'm just curious.
[01:46:41.501 --> 01:46:42.482]  And here's the other thing too.
[01:46:42.702 --> 01:46:43.423]  Think about this, Rob.
[01:46:44.915 --> 01:46:51.679]  So you've got a government proposing to study systemic racism and religious discrimination.
[01:46:52.279 --> 01:46:57.963]  If your government is open to studying those things, do you think it's actually going on?
[01:46:59.841 --> 01:47:02.285]  Oh, in Canada, they're definitely going to find more.
[01:47:02.305 --> 01:47:05.109]  They're going to say, the Muslims are the most persecuted.
[01:47:05.249 --> 01:47:06.411]  I found a website.
[01:47:06.791 --> 01:47:12.460]  We have to give them more, and we're going to shut down websites that talk about Islamic terrorism.
[01:47:13.081 --> 01:47:15.084]  This will all happen until they have a big terror attack.
[01:47:15.717 --> 01:47:18.258]  Look, you know what?
[01:47:19.079 --> 01:47:20.679]  I am so racist, just inherently.
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:29.124]  I am so racist against everyone, that I'm right now going to just give all my money and everything I've ever done to charity.
[01:47:29.224 --> 01:47:29.724]  I'm just done.
[01:47:29.924 --> 01:47:31.525]  And I'm still racist, by the way.
[01:47:32.065 --> 01:47:35.367]  And I'm going to look into how I can fight racism, but dammit, I'm racist!
[01:47:36.252 --> 01:47:39.033]  I'm racist, I'm here to fight racism, but I'm still racist.
[01:47:39.053 --> 01:47:40.373]  That's what Canada is saying.
[01:47:41.393 --> 01:47:56.297]  So, it goes on, M103 is not giving a preference to a community, but rather is tackling a pressing issue by responding to a petition on Islamophobia presented last year after hate against Muslims more than doubled in a two year period.
[01:47:56.337 --> 01:48:01.338]  Get this, they just say this, hate against Muslims more than doubled in a two year period.
[01:48:02.332 --> 01:48:03.013]  What measurement?
[01:48:03.533 --> 01:48:04.514]  How are you measuring this?
[01:48:04.694 --> 01:48:10.859]  They don't provide any data, they don't provide any instances, no examples, they just say hate against Muslims has more than doubled.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.382]  At least they could have provided a Twitter hate index or something.
[01:48:14.402 --> 01:48:15.763]  What is the hate measurement, Rob?
[01:48:15.783 --> 01:48:16.183]  Do you know?
[01:48:16.404 --> 01:48:16.584]  No.
[01:48:16.884 --> 01:48:17.685]  Can you tell me this?
[01:48:18.605 --> 01:48:18.926]  Please.
[01:48:19.706 --> 01:48:20.287]  Please, Rob.
[01:48:21.027 --> 01:48:23.690]  They go on, they say, what exactly is the Sharia?
[01:48:24.838 --> 01:48:25.959]  Well, why are you even debating it?
[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:27.401]  Why is this a debate?
[01:48:27.441 --> 01:48:28.922]  Are people debating what the Bible is?
[01:48:29.523 --> 01:48:31.184]  Are people debating what Hinduism is?
[01:48:31.645 --> 01:48:33.547]  Are people debating what Judaism is?
[01:48:34.247 --> 01:48:34.528]  No!
[01:48:34.688 --> 01:48:36.089]  Why is it only Sharia?
[01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:36.710]  Why, Rob?
[01:48:37.330 --> 01:48:37.711]  I don't know.
[01:48:38.271 --> 01:48:38.552]  Why?
[01:48:39.393 --> 01:48:39.733]  Tell me.
[01:48:40.694 --> 01:48:42.235]  I can't believe what I'm hearing right now.
[01:48:42.255 --> 01:48:43.557]  Well, you and I both know why.
[01:48:44.918 --> 01:48:46.619]  I'll continue to let you just respond to this.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:48.301]  Yeah, no, I'm going to pretend I'm a Canadian.
[01:48:48.481 --> 01:48:50.543]  Why are we investigating Sharia?
[01:48:50.983 --> 01:48:51.604]  Say you're sorry.
[01:48:52.264 --> 01:48:52.564]  Sorry.
[01:48:52.625 --> 01:48:52.945]  Thank you.
[01:48:53.385 --> 01:48:55.727]  For those who fear Sharia creep, it's too late.
[01:48:55.827 --> 01:48:56.508]  It's already here.
[01:48:56.928 --> 01:49:11.100]  For most, rather, like the Golden Rule, the Sharia demands that they obey the laws of the land, live peacefully with their neighbors, don't lie, don't cheat, pay their taxes, respect each other, care for the underprivileged and oppressed, and focus on making the world better for all.
[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:11.961]  Does that mean gays too?
[01:49:13.264 --> 01:49:14.633]  And women that don't wear their headscarves.
[01:49:16.989 --> 01:49:18.110]  No, no, it actually doesn't.
[01:49:18.130 --> 01:49:19.051]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[01:49:19.471 --> 01:49:24.955]  And of course, the funny thing is about this, they're quoting a Muslim this whole time.
[01:49:25.235 --> 01:49:27.597]  So, of course, a Muslim is going to say that.
[01:49:27.657 --> 01:49:28.918]  Now, I'm not saying all Muslims are bad.
[01:49:28.958 --> 01:49:29.858]  That's obviously not what I'm saying.
[01:49:30.078 --> 01:49:30.899]  And we're even going to get to that.
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:35.742]  In fact, scholars consider the thrust of the Sharia to be advancing human welfare.
[01:49:36.183 --> 01:49:36.263]  Oh.
[01:49:36.843 --> 01:49:37.944]  It's advancing human welfare.
[01:49:37.964 --> 01:49:44.189]  That's why it's such a debate right now, because it's so universally advancing humans that it's such a debate right now.
[01:49:45.069 --> 01:49:46.970]  Getting past the Sharia hysteria is not enough.
[01:49:47.250 --> 01:49:54.655]  They only object to the term Islamophobia, saying that it's not Islamophobia because it's a grounded fear of bad ideas.
[01:49:55.015 --> 01:49:58.297]  Now, of course, a phobia is the fear of something that is not rational.
[01:49:59.437 --> 01:50:07.582]  So, you know, I guess if somebody in Germany went to a Christmas market and they were afraid they might get run over by a truck, I guess that's just Islamophobia.
[01:50:07.902 --> 01:50:08.463]  Right, right.
[01:50:08.523 --> 01:50:09.783]  There's nothing rational there.
[01:50:10.264 --> 01:50:11.104]  Au contraire!
[01:50:11.445 --> 01:50:12.966]  Or somewhere in France.
[01:50:13.026 --> 01:50:13.966]  I'm reading again from here.
[01:50:14.207 --> 01:50:15.047]  Au contraire!
[01:50:15.167 --> 01:50:26.415]  It is a phobia because it is very prejudiced and bigoted towards Muslims and the irrational and exaggerated fear of an assumed but non-existing monolithic Islam represented by the Sharia boogeyman.
[01:50:26.435 --> 01:50:28.076]  So again, I say, what's happening in Europe?
[01:50:28.096 --> 01:50:28.777]  What's happening in France?
[01:50:29.077 --> 01:50:30.338]  What happened on 9-11?
[01:50:30.538 --> 01:50:31.959]  They say it's all exaggerated!
[01:50:32.299 --> 01:50:41.123]  Because it takes the regressive interpretations of the few who justify terrorism and the anti-modern ideas and instinctively project it onto all Muslims.
[01:50:41.504 --> 01:50:42.024]  Bingo!
[01:50:42.364 --> 01:50:49.648]  I love this point right here because one, that's exactly what the left has done to Donald Trump and his supporters.
[01:50:49.708 --> 01:50:58.592]  They project anything that Trump says or has ever said or anybody who ever supported Trump has said and they just make a blanket statement on Donald Trump and everybody who's ever supported him.
[01:50:58.632 --> 01:51:04.076]  They put it through the leftist prism, which then turns it into misogynist, xenophobic, bigot.
[01:51:04.296 --> 01:51:06.778]  But Rob, but this is where it gets even better, okay?
[01:51:06.978 --> 01:51:15.165]  So they say, clear majority of Muslims, a clear majority of Muslims are peaceful,
[01:51:16.226 --> 01:51:20.688]  But yet, because of the ones that aren't, that authenticates our extremist views.
[01:51:21.248 --> 01:51:22.268]  So they're admitting it!
[01:51:22.548 --> 01:51:22.828]  Wow.
[01:51:22.929 --> 01:51:26.710]  They're admitting that radical Islamic terror exists!
[01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:28.270]  Right there!
[01:51:28.831 --> 01:51:30.171]  In that statement!
[01:51:30.731 --> 01:51:31.852]  So you are admitting it!
[01:51:31.912 --> 01:51:34.133]  So therefore it is not Islamophobia!
[01:51:34.473 --> 01:51:38.294]  You have just trumped yourself in your own story!
[01:51:38.894 --> 01:51:39.715]  Rob Dio, I'm...
[01:51:40.595 --> 01:51:40.976]  Sorry.
[01:51:41.056 --> 01:51:41.756]  I'm sorry, Rob.
[01:51:41.797 --> 01:51:42.077]  Sorry.
[01:51:42.137 --> 01:51:42.938]  Sorry.
[01:51:42.978 --> 01:51:43.398]  Sorry.
[01:51:44.159 --> 01:51:44.500]  Sorry.
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:48.744]  Apologize to the Canadian who called, and all the Canadians in the future.
[01:51:48.865 --> 01:51:50.446]  So by the way, sorry.
[01:51:50.566 --> 01:51:51.067]  Sorry.
[01:51:51.127 --> 01:51:51.628]  I'm sorry.
[01:51:52.308 --> 01:51:55.092]  By the way, this was from a, of course, a professor.
[01:51:55.512 --> 01:51:56.173]  How do you like that?
[01:51:56.213 --> 01:52:02.619]  A professor at Valparaiso, a professor at Osgoode Hall in Toronto.
[01:52:02.899 --> 01:52:04.200]  Yeah, I wonder what he's a professor of.
[01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:06.903]  Faisal Kutty is his name.
[01:52:07.023 --> 01:52:09.445]  Faisal Kutty, at Faisal Kutty.
[01:52:10.006 --> 01:52:12.949]  If you want to tweet at him and talk about this story with him.
[01:52:13.009 --> 01:52:15.471]  I'd like to have him on as a guest.
[01:52:15.491 --> 01:52:16.752]  Do you think he'd come on and talk to me?
[01:52:16.932 --> 01:52:17.553]  Definitely not.
[01:52:17.593 --> 01:52:20.115]  Hey, we got a few more minutes here just for our hour.
[01:52:20.135 --> 01:52:20.736]  He wouldn't talk to me?
[01:52:21.056 --> 01:52:21.736]  I don't think you would.
[01:52:21.776 --> 01:52:22.936]  No, these people don't like to debate.
[01:52:23.056 --> 01:52:23.557]  Come on.
[01:52:23.637 --> 01:52:24.537]  They're not into debating.
[01:52:24.557 --> 01:52:25.577]  We don't have any proof of that.
[01:52:25.637 --> 01:52:27.517]  They're into hiding behind legislation.
[01:52:27.637 --> 01:52:28.338]  We don't have any proof of that.
[01:52:28.358 --> 01:52:34.139]  And hiding behind banning people and taking away people's freedom of speech, which is why we're having this 13-hour broadcast right now.
[01:52:35.159 --> 01:52:37.259]  And we have some amazing specials at Infowarsstore.com.

[01:52:51.263 --> 01:52:52.604]  Let's go to Chris in Virginia.
[01:52:53.224 --> 01:52:54.105]  Thanks for holding, Chris.
[01:52:55.245 --> 01:52:56.926]  Something about a scene from The Matrix.
[01:52:57.507 --> 01:52:57.967]  What's going on?
[01:52:58.047 --> 01:53:07.172]  Yeah, it reminds me of that scene where Neo had met the Architect, and the Architect is telling him how he had created The Matrix.
[01:53:07.999 --> 01:53:24.242]  And it was perfect in all its form, but 99% perfect, but that 1% and telling them what Neal had represented, it's kind of like Donald Trump when he's going in there and finding out what's going on with this system that we live in and finding out how crooked it is.
[01:53:24.522 --> 01:53:29.723]  He represents our 1% to change everything against our crooked establishment.
[01:53:30.023 --> 01:53:33.744]  That the only way you probably would have been able to change anything is from the top.
[01:53:34.524 --> 01:53:35.204]  Look at, uh,
[01:53:36.196 --> 01:53:48.202]  Paul and all the other senators, you know that they want to do something, they want to affect change, but they can't because they feel like pessimistic about it.
[01:53:48.222 --> 01:53:49.543]  They feel like nothing never changed.
[01:53:49.583 --> 01:53:57.266]  Now, boom, Donald Trump comes along and they inject a dose of hope that I think that they need going forward.
[01:53:57.346 --> 01:54:04.570]  It's just crazy how the similarities in the Matrix and the real world is going on with the robots, things that they talk about.
[01:54:08.615 --> 01:54:17.480]  You know, a lot of people like to argue when you get in these arguments with liberals, they want to argue, well he said this, he did this, he did this.
[01:54:17.741 --> 01:54:18.881]  You know what he also said?
[01:54:18.921 --> 01:54:21.363]  He said, Americanism versus globalism.
[01:54:21.843 --> 01:54:24.665]  And that is the key crux of what he's about.
[01:54:25.509 --> 01:54:29.931]  Do we want to be controlled by multinational corporations and giant Federal Reserve type banks?
[01:54:30.371 --> 01:54:32.071]  Or do we want to have our own destiny?
[01:54:32.492 --> 01:54:42.415]  Do we want to pay less money to these giant combines and unelected bureaucratic organizations that try to make laws that supersede our sovereignty?
[01:54:42.715 --> 01:54:44.096]  Or do we want to make our own laws?
[01:54:44.796 --> 01:54:48.117]  That's the big crux of his administration, of what it's going to be.
[01:54:48.538 --> 01:54:52.359]  Is it going to be being led by giant corporations?
[01:54:52.519 --> 01:54:54.760]  Oh, he put people and corporations in his cabinet.
[01:54:56.391 --> 01:54:58.212]  What do you think every other cabinet has in it?
[01:54:58.332 --> 01:55:12.439]  You're not going to get the lone thinker off the street and put him into the... You've got to put people in who have led people, people who have a track record of leading people, and people who have seen the other side of the Matrix and know how to defeat it.
[01:55:12.679 --> 01:55:15.881]  Do you want to control your own destiny or do you want a shadow government to do it?
[01:55:16.261 --> 01:55:16.621]  Exactly.
[01:55:16.641 --> 01:55:17.522]  That's what it comes down to.
[01:55:18.522 --> 01:55:26.308]  You might want to go to Infowarsstore.com and get that emergency food, especially right now with the water filter in there.
[01:55:26.348 --> 01:55:28.190]  Now, Rob, I don't know if you saw this story.
[01:55:28.630 --> 01:55:32.593]  Dakota Access Pipeline protesters set fire to structures.
[01:55:33.214 --> 01:55:33.794]  So get this.
[01:55:33.855 --> 01:55:39.279]  So you've got the Dakota Access Pipeline protesters who left heaps of trash at their protest site.
[01:55:39.999 --> 01:55:43.342]  Now, you've got them actually out destroying property.
[01:55:45.344 --> 01:55:47.425]  Now, they're claiming they want to protect the water.
[01:55:48.294 --> 01:55:49.218]  I find this funny, Rob.
[01:55:50.322 --> 01:56:00.187]  Have these protesters protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline, who are claiming that it's to protect the water, have they ever protested against fluoride in the water?
[01:56:00.468 --> 01:56:01.048]  Probably not.
[01:56:01.068 --> 01:56:01.708]  They probably have.
[01:56:02.168 --> 01:56:05.270]  Up in that Indian Reservation, there's probably fluoride in that water.
[01:56:05.610 --> 01:56:07.391]  I can almost guarantee it because it's federally run.
[01:56:07.411 --> 01:56:09.252]  What about glyphosate?
[01:56:09.292 --> 01:56:17.257]  And their fluoride levels are going to be two to three times higher than what you'd find in a normal municipality, which we get enough as it is here in Austin.
[01:56:17.277 --> 01:56:19.698]  But a pro-peer system will take the fluoride out, by the way.
[01:56:20.178 --> 01:56:35.949]  I just found this story funny, because all these protesters are now getting violent, it seems like, at every turn, more violence, and they say they want to protect the water, yet they've said nothing about fluoride, nothing about glyphosates, nothing really about the actual issues with the water that we drink every day.
[01:56:36.289 --> 01:56:39.131]  I think we've got time for another call before Rob and I pass the torch.
[01:56:39.151 --> 01:56:40.372]  Thanks for calling Chris, that was a great call.
[01:56:40.412 --> 01:56:40.892]  Thank you, Chris.
[01:56:40.912 --> 01:56:42.613]  Let's go to Eli in California.
[01:56:43.774 --> 01:56:44.955]  Hi there guys, how are you?
[01:56:45.335 --> 01:56:45.956]  Hey, doing great.
[01:56:47.117 --> 01:56:47.697]  That's great.
[01:56:49.818 --> 01:57:04.733]  I live in East Sac in California, and on top of all the problems that I'm hearing from all of you all, I'm over here dealing with the real life and death situation with watching the dam up in Oroville, and so we're kind of dealing with all that kind of stuff right now.
[01:57:06.601 --> 01:57:09.283]  But, you know, it's kind of piling on top.
[01:57:09.744 --> 01:57:11.205]  You know, and it's not just the dam.
[01:57:11.545 --> 01:57:16.830]  There was a railroad derailment when a levy flooded over and took out a train track.
[01:57:17.150 --> 01:57:23.516]  There's been roads just crumbling away because California spends more money on immigrants than it does on its infrastructure.
[01:57:24.216 --> 01:57:24.817]  Exactly.
[01:57:25.357 --> 01:57:27.799]  So I call this the Jerry Brown flood.
[01:57:27.819 --> 01:57:28.880]  Illegal immigrants, too.
[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:29.040]  Yeah.
[01:57:29.961 --> 01:57:30.141]  Well.
[01:57:30.642 --> 01:57:31.442]  So repeat that again.
[01:57:31.482 --> 01:57:32.243]  The Jerry Brown what?
[01:57:33.164 --> 01:57:34.205]  The Jerry Brown flood.
[01:57:37.378 --> 01:57:43.500]  So anyway, what I wanted to ask you is, you know, you're getting the word out.
[01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:44.240]  That's great.
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:50.341]  You know, I'm going to do what I can to support, you know, your situation by going to InfoWars stores and all that.
[01:57:50.781 --> 01:57:51.602]  You know, that's great.
[01:57:52.042 --> 01:58:04.225]  But the thing that I wanted to bring out to you is you're bringing out all this information, but there really isn't anything being said about how we are maybe winning the war.
[01:58:05.123 --> 01:58:13.406]  Because I really believe that we are, you know, that there are some good things happening, but I'm not really hearing it coming from you all.
[01:58:13.786 --> 01:58:15.987]  Sure, well Trump's election proves we're winning the war.
[01:58:16.287 --> 01:58:33.653]  Trump's election hands down says that people have awakened and they're not going to just be bought off by multi-million dollar campaigns, multi-a-billion dollar campaign plus from Hillary Clinton to be told that you have to vote this witch into office because her husband was president and like to, you know, rape his staff.
[01:58:34.153 --> 01:58:36.754]  Well, and where are we seeing the worst of it?
[01:58:36.774 --> 01:58:38.435]  It's in the digital landscape, right?
[01:58:38.655 --> 01:58:45.537]  So, they have this instinct to control the digital landscape because they view it as the power of the future.
[01:58:46.017 --> 01:58:54.160]  So, of course, they're going to try to provide the optics that we are losing this fight, especially in the digital world.
[01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:58.062]  But I think in the real world, as you just mentioned, we elected Donald Trump.
[01:58:59.378 --> 01:59:05.205]  As you know, the protests, honestly, they're getting fewer and far between, and they're just completely deranged.
[01:59:05.485 --> 01:59:06.046]  And you know what?
[01:59:06.426 --> 01:59:13.554]  And we didn't get to this clip, but Maxine Waters went on MSNBC with, I don't even know the little guy's name.
[01:59:13.754 --> 01:59:14.335]  Mr. Maddow.
[01:59:14.395 --> 01:59:15.136]  Mr. Maddow.
[01:59:15.436 --> 01:59:18.439]  And she is, we're not going to the clips, guys.
[01:59:19.981 --> 01:59:21.681]  She's completely lost her mind, okay?
[01:59:21.801 --> 01:59:26.542]  And this is the kind of people that they're sending out there on the left because they have nothing left whatsoever.
[01:59:26.642 --> 01:59:33.104]  I'm actually hearing rumors that Zuckerberg and Mark Cuban are thinking about running on the left for the upcoming election, so Trump 2020.
[01:59:33.424 --> 01:59:38.905]  But the fact that they send Maxine Waters out there, she can't, look at this folks, she can't even quote for herself.
[01:59:38.925 --> 01:59:43.026]  She has to read off notes and then she has to look at her holder, she's like, oh can I say this?
[01:59:43.066 --> 01:59:43.526]  What do I say?
[01:59:43.546 --> 01:59:43.806]  Yes, yes.
[01:59:45.379 --> 01:59:47.121]  Maxine Waters just blows my mind, Rob.
[01:59:47.141 --> 01:59:47.661]  Close us out.
[01:59:47.701 --> 01:59:48.102]  I'm sorry.
[01:59:48.262 --> 01:59:49.263]  Maxine Waters is unbelievable.
[01:59:49.303 --> 01:59:49.883]  What a piece of filth.
[01:59:50.063 --> 01:59:52.846]  It just proves these people have outlived their usefulness.
[01:59:52.866 --> 01:59:53.727]  They need to move on.
[01:59:54.067 --> 01:59:55.829]  Let some young blood into this system.
[01:59:56.249 --> 01:59:57.030]  Her and Pelosi?
[01:59:57.170 --> 01:59:57.891]  They're fossils.
[01:59:58.411 --> 01:59:59.833]  And they're mentally deranged!
[02:00:00.333 --> 02:00:01.633]  That is not rhetoric.
[02:00:01.653 --> 02:00:02.654]  John McCain is a fossil.
[02:00:02.714 --> 02:00:04.034]  Lindsey Graham is a fossil.
[02:00:04.054 --> 02:00:08.815]  They have no concept of what is normal and what is good in this world.
[02:00:08.875 --> 02:00:11.596]  They are creatures of the system.
[02:00:11.896 --> 02:00:20.778]  They need to have the political stake shoved in their hearts so we can move on, get some new blood in, and get to work on some problems that are going on in this country and set a fact.
[02:00:20.798 --> 02:00:21.918]  40% of the United States
[02:00:24.299 --> 02:00:24.839]  I think so.
[02:00:46.869 --> 02:00:51.272]  This has been adopted as of 2017 by the Department of Defense.
[02:00:51.853 --> 02:00:53.254]  All four branches of the military.
[02:00:53.954 --> 02:00:54.815]  Combat One.
[02:00:55.856 --> 02:01:03.702]  And guess who in the spring of 2017 has the exclusive right to sell this to everybody else?
[02:01:04.881 --> 02:01:06.022]  But the military.
[02:01:06.924 --> 02:01:08.466]  Infowars.com.
[02:01:09.086 --> 02:01:12.671]  I want to commend Q and Patrick and the rest of our team.
[02:01:12.711 --> 02:01:15.955]  I want to commend Combat One for getting the big Pentagon deal.
[02:01:16.576 --> 02:01:19.339]  And I want to thank them for supporting us because they know we support America.
[02:01:19.659 --> 02:01:23.024]  We are the exclusive source of Combat One.
[02:01:23.604 --> 02:01:35.532]  Skin and muscle optimization, field foam, field spray, skin and muscle optimization, and broad spectrum hygiene tactical bath contains eight pre-moistened cloths.
[02:01:36.193 --> 02:01:38.495]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are incredibly affordable.
[02:01:39.295 --> 02:01:41.818]  And they have patented proprietary systems.
[02:01:42.399 --> 02:01:47.465]  That's why it's been adopted by the Pentagon, by the Defense Department, system-wide.
[02:01:47.525 --> 02:01:54.413]  I'm going to go over some of the numbers, some of the proven statistics and the claims that Combat One can make right now.
[02:01:55.234 --> 02:02:04.283]  Never before has the public been able to access this new Combat One military-grade hygiene technology used by special operations to maintain hygiene during survival situations.
[02:02:04.644 --> 02:02:06.746]  Studied for safety and effectiveness by St.
[02:02:06.806 --> 02:02:08.848]  John's Medical Research Institute, St.
[02:02:08.928 --> 02:02:16.676]  Jude's, and the American Journal of Infection Control, the technology behind Combat One wipes kills bad bacteria while leaving beneficial
[02:02:17.376 --> 02:02:18.838]  Skin bacteria unharmed.
[02:02:18.958 --> 02:02:20.360]  That's the key buffer.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:24.985]  The toxic wipes, the sanitizers kill everything, including your immune system.
[02:02:25.005 --> 02:02:25.946]  They lower your fertility.
[02:02:25.966 --> 02:02:26.506]  It's all embedded.
[02:02:27.067 --> 02:02:30.431]  Combat One is able to do this naturally by only targeting the bad stuff.
[02:02:30.871 --> 02:02:31.732]  And again, it's all patented.
[02:02:31.772 --> 02:02:33.154]  It's super secret.
[02:02:33.174 --> 02:02:34.815]  12 years Special Forces testing it.
[02:02:35.436 --> 02:02:40.822]  This is something every Info Warrior needs to order, needs to have in their home, needs to use in their daily lives.
[02:02:41.142 --> 02:02:46.547]  Whether it's cleaning your guns or your own skin, or when you're out camping, this is the game changer.
[02:02:46.567 --> 02:02:51.692]  The entire family of Combat One is available exclusively at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:02:52.668 --> 02:02:56.030]  Just coming back from the river where I was using one of our water filtration straws.
[02:02:56.550 --> 02:02:58.911]  A certain device we sell here at Infantwarestore.com.
[02:02:59.651 --> 02:03:04.574]  And I had smacked my knuckle pretty hard the other day with my knife after cleaning one of the animals.
[02:03:04.594 --> 02:03:07.135]  So I'm going to use some Combat One Foam.
[02:03:07.515 --> 02:03:08.816]  Show you guys that we actually use it.
[02:03:09.256 --> 02:03:10.937]  How well it works.
[02:03:11.017 --> 02:03:13.138]  This wound's been open for about five days now.
[02:03:13.918 --> 02:03:15.459]  I just dipped it in out of the river.
[02:03:15.779 --> 02:03:17.840]  So just to better safe than sorry.
[02:03:27.313 --> 02:03:30.676]  Once I let that soak in, I'll wrap it up, feel dressed nice and clean again.
[02:03:31.477 --> 02:03:34.260]  And it certainly is coming to the rescue with Combat One.
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:35.721]  Born in America.
[02:03:36.162 --> 02:03:37.063]  Made in America.
[02:03:37.623 --> 02:03:40.045]  And now distributed by InfoWars to America.
[02:03:46.542 --> 02:03:47.924]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:03:48.204 --> 02:03:49.506]  You can't survive without it.
[02:03:49.687 --> 02:03:50.608]  But where do you get it?
[02:03:50.908 --> 02:03:56.656]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:03:56.897 --> 02:04:02.625]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:04:02.785 --> 02:04:19.669]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:04:20.049 --> 02:04:22.171]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:04:22.551 --> 02:04:23.732]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:04:24.013 --> 02:04:24.773]  Easy assembly.
[02:04:25.054 --> 02:04:25.674]  Low maintenance.
[02:04:25.954 --> 02:04:27.776]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:04:58.016 --> 02:05:09.339]  Oh yes, the powers we possess.
[02:05:09.379 --> 02:05:12.220]  Now there's not one, but there are two Wonder Women here.
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:14.421]  All the world is waiting for us.
[02:05:15.081 --> 02:05:16.461]  Millie Weaver joins me now.
[02:05:16.481 --> 02:05:18.422]  We are going to be here with you from 5 to 7.
[02:05:18.462 --> 02:05:21.903]  McBreen will be coming in the studio about 6 o'clock.
[02:05:22.503 --> 02:05:24.344]  I've got to do a little dance here for this music.
[02:05:25.005 --> 02:05:29.908]  Shout out to the fan, the awesome fan who made me the theme song.
[02:05:29.948 --> 02:05:30.829]  I mean, my God.
[02:05:30.869 --> 02:05:31.550]  Wow.
[02:05:31.770 --> 02:05:39.195]  Well, it's so great to be here with you today, Leanne, in support of defending liberty and truth and justice.
[02:05:39.255 --> 02:05:41.397]  Yes, and I think that's just incredible.
[02:05:42.077 --> 02:05:45.119]  And we all want to thank all of you guys out there for sticking with us.
[02:05:45.139 --> 02:05:46.880]  This is our 13 hour broadcast.
[02:05:47.220 --> 02:05:48.421]  Of course, we're under attack.
[02:05:48.481 --> 02:05:50.682]  And Alex, you know, this happened yesterday.
[02:05:50.782 --> 02:05:55.305]  And so immediately he's just troops assemble and we're all here.
[02:05:56.105 --> 02:06:00.508]  And this is why we need your help to help support this broadcast continually throughout the years.
[02:06:00.608 --> 02:06:03.190]  It's been listeners that have supported this broadcast.
[02:06:03.490 --> 02:06:10.154]  But of course, we have the establishment trying to cut off one of our supply lines by knocking out our ability to
[02:06:10.834 --> 02:06:15.118]  Get our products out to the masses by cutting our ad roll.
[02:06:15.438 --> 02:06:21.544]  They say you are political, we can't condone this, you're fake news, and we're going to take you down.
[02:06:21.584 --> 02:06:26.488]  I know McBreen is really going to be breaking this down here about 6 o'clock this evening.
[02:06:27.089 --> 02:06:32.013]  Just all of us truly shocked to see the moves that they will make.
[02:06:32.033 --> 02:06:36.497]  I mean, they're basically letting us know, listen, you guys may have really been the
[02:06:37.478 --> 02:06:40.761]  The pivotal thing, the pinnacle there that helped Donald Trump get elected.
[02:06:41.262 --> 02:06:45.846]  You might have won the battle, but we are still actively fighting this war against you.
[02:06:46.227 --> 02:06:50.591]  And they know that by taking out one of our legs here with this funding, that they could really hurt us.
[02:06:50.931 --> 02:06:53.554]  That's why Alex Jones wanted to just get this message out there.
[02:06:53.714 --> 02:06:55.235]  All of us here are saying please.
[02:06:55.856 --> 02:06:56.777]  We need your help.
[02:06:56.937 --> 02:07:00.920]  Go to the InfoWars store, support us by buying some of these high quality products.
[02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:05.263]  We are doing a lot of specials right now that are live at the InfoWars store.
[02:07:05.724 --> 02:07:09.967]  Take this link, share it on all of your social media outlets that you have.
[02:07:10.267 --> 02:07:13.410]  If you've got a website out there, you know, put a link to our products.
[02:07:13.450 --> 02:07:14.871]  Put a link to this live feed.
[02:07:15.491 --> 02:07:18.772]  Put a link to Alex Jones AMA coming up later at 8 p.m.
[02:07:18.812 --> 02:07:19.253]  Central.
[02:07:19.753 --> 02:07:31.317]  But we're doing super specials, 33% off the stock price of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver, 25% off Super Male Vitality, 25% off Brain Force, Survival Shield as well.
[02:07:31.917 --> 02:07:36.498]  So, I mean, InfoWars is not beholden to the megabanks or government handouts.
[02:07:36.938 --> 02:07:52.183]  And the globalists hate that because they know that we can take our message directly to you and that we don't have to curtail the information that we're bringing to you because Big Pharma disagrees with us that we're trying to inform you about the potential dangers of vaccines and telling you to read the inserts.
[02:07:52.203 --> 02:07:53.583]  They don't want you to read the inserts.
[02:07:53.623 --> 02:07:55.544]  They want you to just listen to their
[02:07:56.524 --> 02:08:08.308]  Propaganda and then go to a commercial which lulls you for a minute and a half into how their big pharma products will give you renal cancer but try it today and by the way it might make you want to kill yourself.
[02:08:09.428 --> 02:08:13.550]  We don't have to issue that kind of a warning with our high quality products.
[02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:15.491]  So help defend InfoWars.
[02:08:15.551 --> 02:08:16.491]  We are under attack.
[02:08:16.531 --> 02:08:19.572]  I mean this is really gonna hurt us this next year but I know Alex Jones.
[02:08:20.112 --> 02:08:21.092]  He's a magic man.
[02:08:21.212 --> 02:08:22.173]  He will figure it out.
[02:08:22.913 --> 02:08:27.895]  Go ahead, take advantage of these new mega specials at InfoWarStore.com right now.
[02:08:28.335 --> 02:08:41.819]  InfoWarStore.com, you are helping to support this broadcast and we always say there's a war on for your mind, but there really is a war on for your mind that has never been more true than it is right now.
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:49.562]  Just the fact that a story that really stood out to me that I just cannot believe, they are trying to co-opt
[02:08:50.722 --> 02:08:53.443]  1984.
[02:08:51.542 --> 02:08:53.443]  And we've been trying to push this out there.
[02:08:53.463 --> 02:08:55.544]  I know Alex Jones talks about this a lot.
[02:08:56.204 --> 02:08:57.544]  How 1984 is here.
[02:08:57.684 --> 02:08:59.945]  It wasn't meant to be a handbook.
[02:09:00.005 --> 02:09:00.806]  It was a warning.
[02:09:01.386 --> 02:09:07.868]  And now the left and these groups are trying to co-opt the 1984 meme and say that it's Donald Trump.
[02:09:08.388 --> 02:09:11.889]  Who is the embodiment of this Orwellian culture.
[02:09:11.949 --> 02:09:13.130]  He is Ingsoc.
[02:09:14.130 --> 02:09:20.592]  When they're the ones that are fighting to put the quote-unquote fake news, anything they disagree with, they want to put that down the memory hole.
[02:09:20.932 --> 02:09:23.113]  They want to silence anyone that they don't like.
[02:09:23.153 --> 02:09:31.616]  They want to take white chalkboards or whiteboards out of classrooms because someone might write something on it and someone will be offended by it.
[02:09:32.216 --> 02:09:34.377]  I mean, it's just absolutely insane.
[02:09:34.417 --> 02:09:40.541]  So you've got independent cinemas across the country are going to be showing 1984 as a Trump protest.
[02:09:41.221 --> 02:09:48.426]  And this is the ultimate doublespeak, like in your face with the government and everyone saying that it's Trump.
[02:09:49.506 --> 02:10:01.294]  They don't want to talk about how Obama was the one who actually went and decided to put this whole fake news thing into law and action to where they can actually then go and censor people based off of their political views.
[02:10:01.634 --> 02:10:13.201]  Trump may have said many times that the mainstream media is putting out fake news, but never once has he ever said that we need to actually censor them or shut them up.
[02:10:13.641 --> 02:10:17.904]  He's never said that at all whatsoever, so Obama is more like,
[02:10:19.044 --> 02:10:19.865]  Exactly!
[02:10:19.925 --> 02:10:22.006]  Hillary would have been the prime example.
[02:10:23.367 --> 02:10:36.814]  The outgoing President Obama had the audacity to just lament the good old days when there was only three media outlets that were giving everyone their information and it was so much easier for people to get the information that they needed.
[02:10:36.834 --> 02:10:42.697]  Yeah, that the government wanted you to know and to filter through their little propaganda channels.
[02:10:42.717 --> 02:10:44.618]  He said it was so much easier there.
[02:10:45.458 --> 02:10:49.519]  He actually said we need a truth, some kind of a truthiness filter.
[02:10:49.779 --> 02:10:51.539]  The Ministry of Truthiness.
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:52.800]  And so this is what it is.
[02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:55.380]  It's just in your face, double speak.
[02:10:55.900 --> 02:11:05.423]  And now they're going to try to co-op 1984 and convince the next generation of people that it's Donald Trump's administration and Donald Trump's agenda that they need to fight against.
[02:11:05.783 --> 02:11:06.523]  War is peace.
[02:11:06.883 --> 02:11:07.883]  Freedom is slavery.
[02:11:08.163 --> 02:11:09.484]  Ignorance is strength.
[02:11:10.004 --> 02:11:14.785]  And you know, Millie, I know that you've encountered a lot of these SJWs, you know, when you
[02:11:15.365 --> 02:11:17.726]  Well, we're out for a little while the other day.
[02:11:17.966 --> 02:11:20.628]  One of these SJWs bombarded our office.
[02:11:20.748 --> 02:11:22.829]  Alex actually gave her a platform to speak.
[02:11:22.909 --> 02:11:23.529]  Oh my gosh!
[02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:25.430]  And she was totally ignorant.
[02:11:25.570 --> 02:11:27.131]  Rainbow Snatch, you missed her.
[02:11:27.231 --> 02:11:28.952]  I mean, I was kind of glad you were out.
[02:11:28.972 --> 02:11:34.335]  Well, I'm so glad that I wasn't there because I don't know how I would have been able to handle someone so easily triggered.
[02:11:34.735 --> 02:11:44.838]  You know, I mean, I come into contact with these SJWs all the time and on the street and yes, they get triggered, they get violent, they've slapped Owen in the face.
[02:11:45.058 --> 02:11:45.898]  What about with you?
[02:11:45.918 --> 02:11:48.539]  They've tried to rip the mic out of my hands.
[02:11:48.619 --> 02:11:53.701]  I mean, I've had everything, you know, pretty much happen to me as regards to that.
[02:11:53.741 --> 02:11:57.702]  But yeah, it's just, they don't want you to have free speech.
[02:11:58.402 --> 02:12:04.384]  They want themselves to have free speech, and they're only going to want their opinion to be the one that's going to be allowed to be talked about.
[02:12:04.404 --> 02:12:05.164]  Look at this girl.
[02:12:05.364 --> 02:12:08.985]  I mean, her armpit hair was horrendous.
[02:12:09.065 --> 02:12:12.606]  I chased her out of the building with a razor blade, actually.
[02:12:14.386 --> 02:12:16.207]  Can you believe this person?
[02:12:16.227 --> 02:12:17.187]  That's what feminism looks like to her.
[02:12:17.227 --> 02:12:20.568]  I guess we shouldn't call her a her, because she might get triggered if we call her a her.
[02:12:20.688 --> 02:12:22.948]  Yeah, she was very upset about being misgendered.
[02:12:25.249 --> 02:12:28.611]  Super angsty, and I'm like what's wrong with you girl?
[02:12:28.651 --> 02:12:31.052]  You know you things can't be that tough for you.
[02:12:31.092 --> 02:12:33.754]  You know apparently you don't even have to work.
[02:12:33.974 --> 02:12:35.735]  Yeah, it must be going right for you.
[02:12:35.755 --> 02:12:36.755]  You're able to.
[02:12:36.815 --> 02:12:43.659]  Apparently she has a Twitter account too, and I guess like a bunch of guys have been following her and people have been following her.
[02:12:43.699 --> 02:12:44.159]  Sexist.
[02:12:44.179 --> 02:12:45.220]  Because it's ridiculous.
[02:12:45.260 --> 02:12:52.764]  It's funny, but she actually was like hey, you know all these cis males need to stop following me because it's sexual harassment.
[02:12:53.024 --> 02:12:54.645]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:12:54.685 --> 02:12:57.886]  Well, we actually sent a camera crew out to follow her around.
[02:12:57.926 --> 02:13:00.247]  You can check that video out at InfoWars.com.
[02:13:00.367 --> 02:13:03.328]  SJW, A Day in the Life.
[02:13:03.368 --> 02:13:07.890]  If you're able to handle the triggering that will happen.
[02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:11.251]  But that's just kind of right out of 1984.
[02:13:11.491 --> 02:13:12.711]  Ignorance is strength.
[02:13:13.192 --> 02:13:19.554]  And they feel like shutting down any speech or any information that they disagree with
[02:13:20.094 --> 02:13:26.438]  They're strong in their ignorance and also it strengthens the state.
[02:13:26.838 --> 02:13:33.702]  It strengthens the deep state and the controllers who don't want the people to be informed and the freedom of information.
[02:13:33.802 --> 02:13:42.767]  You know what, that even reminds me of Clockwork Orange as well because if you remember in the movie Clockwork Orange, the character starts out as like a bunch of joking,
[02:13:43.868 --> 02:13:44.148]  I think so.
[02:14:03.757 --> 02:14:09.901]  Being these kind of clown-like characters, and later on down the road, these are going to be the militants.
[02:14:09.921 --> 02:14:10.481]  Well, that's it.
[02:14:10.521 --> 02:14:14.544]  I mean, if Rainbow snatched, I guarantee you she's in her little black mask on the weekend.
[02:14:14.604 --> 02:14:15.024]  And that's it.
[02:14:15.044 --> 02:14:19.447]  It's like, you think you're just casually out there protesting Donald Trump.
[02:14:19.487 --> 02:14:21.128]  He's the embodiment of Hitler.
[02:14:21.188 --> 02:14:22.589]  Oh my gosh, I got to get out there.
[02:14:23.049 --> 02:14:31.794]  And then the next thing you know, you're throwing off a Molotov cocktail and beating up a woman in the street with a pole or a shovel because she dared to vote for Donald Trump.
[02:14:31.834 --> 02:14:32.975]  I mean, this is madness.
[02:14:33.375 --> 02:14:54.946]  Actually, I think the Daily Caller has a video up that the RNC is now kind of putting out as an advertisement for their party, but it's taking all these quotes and clips of Democrats basically admitting that they always thought that they were the smart ones, that they had the intelligence, that they were the party with all the smarts, but it turns out that they were outclassed.
[02:14:55.566 --> 02:14:56.326]  And it's true!
[02:14:56.466 --> 02:14:58.307]  They've been outclassed.
[02:14:58.327 --> 02:14:58.968]  That's why they have
[02:14:59.728 --> 02:15:02.030]  Almost zero representation out there.
[02:15:02.570 --> 02:15:15.978]  But when you start seeing people beating women, pelting them with eggs, and then the fake news media, lamestream media that's out there is trying to tell you the exact opposite of what you're watching on the screen.
[02:15:16.058 --> 02:15:20.301]  When you're watching a riot, they're calling them peaceful protesters.
[02:15:20.441 --> 02:15:21.622]  And that's what I'm saying.
[02:15:21.682 --> 02:15:24.944]  We're seeing 1984 unfold with the doublespeak.
[02:15:26.565 --> 02:15:27.226]  It's insane.
[02:15:27.366 --> 02:15:34.692]  Now, the Breitbart's got this article out where they point out the left's Alinsky plan to destroy the Trump administration.
[02:15:34.792 --> 02:15:46.983]  And I know you've talked a little bit about earlier just mentioning, you know, leftovers from the Soviet era and these plans that these young people are using these tactics to take out the Trump administration.
[02:15:47.543 --> 02:15:48.163]  Exactly.
[02:15:48.323 --> 02:15:54.766]  And you know, I kind of have this idea that, you know, maybe some of what we're seeing is blowback.
[02:15:54.846 --> 02:16:05.870]  It's the fallout of the Cold War where we had these Soviet Russian spies coming over here in America with the plan to basically take down America.
[02:16:06.250 --> 02:16:06.911]  What did they do?
[02:16:06.971 --> 02:16:09.692]  They sought out grassroots organizations.
[02:16:09.992 --> 02:16:10.852]  With the youth.
[02:16:10.912 --> 02:16:11.432]  Exactly.
[02:16:11.472 --> 02:16:13.573]  Even the Black Panthers at that time.
[02:16:14.033 --> 02:16:15.354]  And they... The Weather Underground.
[02:16:15.854 --> 02:16:23.017]  Yes, the Weather Underground, and they wanted to influence them, influence the young minds, and the perfect age group.
[02:16:23.037 --> 02:16:39.483]  You know, we have Hillary Clinton, Obama, who were all young during that time period, who has known connections to these communists, and they have actually voiced their communist opinions as well, and then now we're seeing them as adults
[02:16:40.063 --> 02:16:52.008]  Trying to enact their plan, orchestrating a coup against the President of the United States, when we the people, the American people, have woken up and we're like, no, you're not going to take our country from us.
[02:16:52.308 --> 02:16:53.209]  We're going to fight back.
[02:16:53.269 --> 02:16:54.189]  And that's what we did.
[02:16:54.229 --> 02:17:02.973]  And it was the listeners of InfoWars, it was the Donald Trump supporters that really woke up, got up and said, no, we are not going to take it.
[02:17:03.253 --> 02:17:04.113]  So you know what, guys?
[02:17:04.393 --> 02:17:05.414]  We need to stay awake.
[02:17:05.914 --> 02:17:14.377]  Be vigilant and make sure we are still fighting because like Leanne said, you know, we won the battle but we have not yet won the war.
[02:17:14.557 --> 02:17:18.319]  Right, and they're going to keep on fighting and obviously they're not playing fair.
[02:17:18.359 --> 02:17:19.619]  They haven't been playing fair.
[02:17:19.659 --> 02:17:33.745]  We see what they're using their leverage within the social media giants and with the tech giants, their connections that they have there to be able to politically shut us down and take that move of
[02:17:34.505 --> 02:17:40.250]  Cutting off one of our supply channels in order to reach the masses because they're so angry.
[02:17:40.270 --> 02:17:59.147]  I mean, the one good thing about this, what it really shows everyone out there, myself as well, how powerful InfoWars is and how influential, which to me, it's still pretty crazy because just being here behind the scenes, you're just a regular girl, I'm a regular, everyone here is just the average person you'd love to go have a beer with.
[02:17:59.727 --> 02:18:00.687]  A coffee or something.
[02:18:00.828 --> 02:18:24.178]  It's just, we're just average people, but, and Alex Jones, just a regular guy that you'd love to hang out with, but fighting the globalists so effectively that they feel that they have to cut off our funding, make television shows demonizing an Alex Jones-like character, constantly have media attacking us, calling us fake news or a conspiracy.
[02:18:24.218 --> 02:18:25.599]  There's Alex Jones!
[02:18:25.919 --> 02:18:28.460]  I mean, Rachel Maddow trying to bust our
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:33.084]  Chops over our really awesome products, which actually ramped up our sales.
[02:18:34.205 --> 02:18:35.466]  Thank you, Mr. Mattow.
[02:18:35.606 --> 02:18:37.408]  Well, I mean, exactly.
[02:18:37.548 --> 02:18:40.271]  And that's a great point, Leigh-Anne.
[02:18:40.371 --> 02:18:43.294]  And it just goes to show, they don't want us speaking.
[02:18:43.314 --> 02:18:51.221]  They don't want an alternate news source for Americans to go and listen to because they want to control the narrative.
[02:18:51.281 --> 02:18:52.602]  They want to control the programming.
[02:18:52.883 --> 02:18:53.844]  And it just reminds me.
[02:18:54.464 --> 02:18:55.184]  Of course!
[02:19:13.609 --> 02:19:14.350]  Alex Jones, right?
[02:19:14.390 --> 02:19:16.851]  I mean, she didn't say Alex Jones, but she might as well have.
[02:19:17.332 --> 02:19:18.252]  And that's just it.
[02:19:18.313 --> 02:19:23.516]  They're really mad and upset that we are breaking through the programming.
[02:19:23.697 --> 02:19:24.217]  Exactly.
[02:19:24.277 --> 02:19:31.883]  And that's why it was just so audacious when Donald Trump came out and said that the mainstream media is the enemy of the American people.
[02:19:32.443 --> 02:19:37.205]  And then, so then the mainstream media comes out and says, oh my god, he's attacking the press!
[02:19:37.305 --> 02:19:38.525]  We're the First Amendment!
[02:19:38.945 --> 02:19:41.606]  The First Amendment is power to the people.
[02:19:41.766 --> 02:19:44.147]  And it's like, no, you're not the free speech.
[02:19:44.227 --> 02:19:46.388]  You're the controlled opposition.
[02:19:46.448 --> 02:19:47.728]  You are the controlled media.
[02:19:47.788 --> 02:19:49.209]  You are the propaganda channel.
[02:19:49.549 --> 02:19:54.671]  And you were so in the bag for Hillary Clinton, just like you had been sycophants for President
[02:19:55.151 --> 02:19:59.014]  Obama, the last eight years, you truly thought that you were just in the bag.
[02:19:59.054 --> 02:20:00.955]  You never checked Obama on anything.
[02:20:01.296 --> 02:20:06.920]  They're kissing his butt, taking pictures with him, buying his photographs so you could hang them on your wall.
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:09.562]  And, you know, they're the press.
[02:20:09.762 --> 02:20:13.845]  They truly thought that they were just going to continue with this establishment.
[02:20:14.145 --> 02:20:16.687]  And they're so angry that Donald Trump won this election.
[02:20:16.727 --> 02:20:17.868]  They're not going to let it go.
[02:20:17.908 --> 02:20:20.190]  They're not going to forgive him for calling them out.
[02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:23.412]  And they're not going to forgive him for winning this election.
[02:20:23.712 --> 02:20:24.293]  So we see
[02:20:24.953 --> 02:20:39.530]  Not only on the ground these alleged grassroots groups fighting against Trump, also going to these town halls protesting any Republican candidates there, especially ones who think they're in safe seats, so that they can go use these
[02:20:40.971 --> 02:20:42.012]  We're good.
[02:21:02.060 --> 02:21:03.661]  It's insane what we're living through right now.
[02:21:03.701 --> 02:21:06.482]  Well, do you know what a terrifying thought is?
[02:21:06.902 --> 02:21:12.384]  Is what if Hillary Clinton actually did succeed in winning the presidency?
[02:21:13.004 --> 02:21:14.725]  What if she actually won?
[02:21:15.285 --> 02:21:20.067]  And then they enacted these things like trying to cut Infowars' funding.
[02:21:21.187 --> 02:21:31.870]  We would be really worried guys because she would be able to fully try and shut us down as the president because there would be no resistance, no opposition to her at all whatsoever.
[02:21:32.170 --> 02:21:38.592]  When you have Google, you have all these different big giant corporate CEOs all lining up behind her.
[02:21:38.872 --> 02:21:47.354]  If you want to talk about fascism, let's talk about Hillary Clinton having all these corporations all backing her like we've never seen before.
[02:21:47.654 --> 02:21:49.315]  Government control of everything.
[02:21:49.856 --> 02:21:59.923]  And that's just it, is that we were all pretty frightened when thinking, wow, Hillary Clinton's gonna get in, she name-dropped Alex Jones, called him the dark heart, and they start talking about all this fake news.
[02:22:00.203 --> 02:22:02.504]  We could see the writing on the wall, we could see what they were doing.
[02:22:02.925 --> 02:22:12.851]  She lost, yet that agenda that they were setting in place with President Obama signing the countering foreign intelligence
[02:22:13.832 --> 02:22:18.035]  Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act and signing that into law quietly.
[02:22:18.435 --> 02:22:38.527]  So just because she did not win, that whole agenda that they were working on to silence the alternative media, the free, the truly free press, that is still being pushed ahead because these people with this globalist mindset, this globalist agenda, this New World Order mindset, they still
[02:22:39.568 --> 02:22:51.551]  Are hoping that they can shut us down and get back their representation here in a couple years, definitely by 2018, but also in France with their elections coming up, in Germany with their elections coming up.
[02:22:51.631 --> 02:23:08.295]  They can't lose the stronghold that they have in those countries, so much so that they're willing to silence the amount of rapes and crimes that are being committed by these refugees and these migrants that they've brought them into their country for their cultural enrichment.
[02:23:08.735 --> 02:23:20.859]  They actually silenced these people and refused to report on it and instead do these glowing reviews of the glowing love story between the lady and her lover at the refugee camp.
[02:23:21.039 --> 02:23:22.700]  It's just, to me, it's so horrible.
[02:23:22.980 --> 02:23:24.540]  It's absolutely a tragedy.
[02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:25.280]  And you know what?
[02:23:25.501 --> 02:23:35.364]  It just really, you can just tell that they had everything in place to completely push forward in their New World Order agenda because
[02:23:36.344 --> 02:23:42.987]  Even the TV series Homeland, I mean, they had a woman president starring in that.
[02:23:43.307 --> 02:23:59.213]  And the opposition, you know, they're having this Alex Jones, James O'Keefe kind of meshed in character that is this radio host that, you know, you have this guy that is the main star, listens to it all the time, and he's, you know, depicted as a terrorist.
[02:23:59.793 --> 02:24:01.594]  So this was totally in place.
[02:24:01.614 --> 02:24:05.597]  It was like they all knew, okay, Hillary's gonna win and this is what we're gonna do.
[02:24:05.677 --> 02:24:07.238]  It's gonna be systematic.
[02:24:07.618 --> 02:24:11.921]  We are going to shut down the, you know, alternate news out there.
[02:24:12.261 --> 02:24:18.265]  We are going to enact our, you know, system of control to just silence opposition.
[02:24:18.305 --> 02:24:19.665]  You can just tell it was all there.
[02:24:19.886 --> 02:24:20.126]  Right.
[02:24:20.326 --> 02:24:24.749]  And that's the thing is when we knew that Donald Trump, they had a few days where they were all crying.
[02:24:25.529 --> 02:24:26.130]  I think?
[02:24:46.428 --> 02:24:46.548]  Yeah.
[02:25:04.221 --> 02:25:10.065]  These people are going to be using these Alinsky tactics to go and bully your representatives that you voted in.
[02:25:10.446 --> 02:25:12.988]  We all went to the voting booth and made our voices heard.
[02:25:13.548 --> 02:25:18.412]  Around the country it was red and tiny little specks of blue.
[02:25:18.732 --> 02:25:25.437]  So now they're going to go to these town halls and bully them and try to push them back to the left and say, well, we're going to vote you out.
[02:25:25.697 --> 02:25:29.080]  These are people that most likely don't even live in their district.
[02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:34.681]  But they're going to these representatives and bullying them to try to push them back into the agenda that they want.
[02:25:35.041 --> 02:25:41.223]  And the thing is, is that a lot of these Republicans are truly going to just cow down to it because they're, they're wimps.
[02:25:41.483 --> 02:25:42.603]  They're totally wimps.
[02:25:42.723 --> 02:25:51.485]  And that's why they, you know, the people elected Donald Trump is because they were sick of these wimps that keep bowing down to, well, please don't call me a racist, sexist, homophobe.
[02:25:51.545 --> 02:25:54.285]  I'll do whatever you want, even if it's not true.
[02:25:54.305 --> 02:25:56.826]  Well, this, the crazy part is, is, you know,
[02:25:57.486 --> 02:26:11.132]  You have all these paid protesters that go to these different towns to protest, to have their bullying moment where they're either going to bully the police station or the local government officials there, or even how they went to D.C.
[02:26:11.152 --> 02:26:12.333]  to try and bully Trump.
[02:26:12.893 --> 02:26:17.618]  But you know, most of Trump's supporters and the Republicans actually have real lives.
[02:26:17.658 --> 02:26:18.899]  They actually have jobs.
[02:26:18.939 --> 02:26:23.503]  They can't necessarily drop their life and come out to protest.
[02:26:23.984 --> 02:26:27.247]  But we saw them actually do that during the inauguration.
[02:26:27.267 --> 02:26:33.312]  And the mainstream media completely tried to cover it up, tried to lie about the numbers, but there was so much support out there.
[02:26:35.134 --> 02:26:47.017]  Evidence surfaced that by James O'Keefe, who also is going to be dropping some bombs this week with some video footage that was supplied to him by someone within the network, by someone on the inside.
[02:26:47.337 --> 02:26:48.357]  And see, that's how it is.
[02:26:48.637 --> 02:26:56.699]  We can't, you know, blast all these people because typically it is someone on the inside who wants to take down the system because they can see how evil it is.
[02:26:56.739 --> 02:27:03.181]  They can see that it is truly lies and they don't want to be a part of that because for the most part, humanity is good.
[02:27:03.301 --> 02:27:03.961]  We are good.
[02:27:04.341 --> 02:27:09.567]  Let's throw to some of these clips real quick before we take a quick break, just to kind of give you guys an idea.
[02:27:09.647 --> 02:27:15.294]  So we've got a Democratic rep talking about left-wing groups organizing these town hall protests.
[02:27:15.314 --> 02:27:17.637]  This is Democrat Ted Lieu.
[02:27:17.697 --> 02:27:21.701]  He wants you to believe that all this resistance is just totally grassroots, man.
[02:27:23.359 --> 02:27:36.709]  I want to get your reaction overall to what your colleagues are seeing at some of these town halls, congressmen, and the president's point that these are planned, in some cases, planned protests from groups like Indivisible and others of progressives and liberals coming into these red districts.
[02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:39.331]  The president's just wrong.
[02:27:39.391 --> 02:27:41.853]  These are organic, grassroots protests.
[02:27:42.978 --> 02:27:44.759]  There are groups though, right?
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:52.585]  I mean, you don't deny that there are groups of more liberal activists who are helping to organize some of these protests at town halls.
[02:28:05.609 --> 02:28:14.039]  Well yes, there are groups that are organizing people to show up at town halls, but these are people who are constituents of these members of Congress.
[02:28:14.339 --> 02:28:24.771]  That's what people do, they show up at town halls and they give their voices to these members of Congress, and you're seeing this huge reaction to Donald Trump's extreme and cruel policies.
[02:28:25.787 --> 02:28:26.468]  I want to get your reaction.
[02:28:26.708 --> 02:28:33.833]  So this totally grassroots reaction is just, you know, the result of Donald Trump's cruel policies.
[02:28:34.494 --> 02:28:39.517]  And not, of course, the increased media attention to what they perceive.
[02:28:39.597 --> 02:28:41.539]  Oh, look at all these ICE raids.
[02:28:41.699 --> 02:28:42.579]  Oh my gosh.
[02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:50.005]  Meanwhile, there was no uproar in 2011 when there were massive nationwide ICE raids and about 350 percent
[02:28:51.926 --> 02:28:52.146]  I don't
[02:29:09.255 --> 02:29:15.198]  Ill-informed people are really just watching the media that's pumping out this false narrative.
[02:29:15.518 --> 02:29:22.201]  So now we're going to go on to this next video because we reported that these Obama-linked activists, they've got a training manual.
[02:29:22.521 --> 02:29:23.841]  They're teaching people how to do this.
[02:29:23.881 --> 02:29:25.942]  You can go online, learn how to protest Trump.
[02:29:26.403 --> 02:29:27.803]  So this is the Progressive's Guide.
[02:29:27.843 --> 02:29:31.865]  It teaches you how to persecute your representatives.
[02:29:32.365 --> 02:29:34.026]  This is put out by a group, Indivisible.
[02:29:38.857 --> 02:29:42.519]  If you're like me, you've been pretty freaked out about Trump and his agenda.
[02:29:42.699 --> 02:29:47.882]  Wow.
[02:29:48.122 --> 02:29:48.643]  Good news.
[02:29:49.183 --> 02:29:56.647]  Smart people with tons of experience in how politics really work have put together a practical guide on how to make Congress listen to us.
[02:29:56.827 --> 02:29:57.388]  But a warning.
[02:29:58.028 --> 02:30:00.509]  It's going to require a little more than just calls and petitions.
[02:30:01.870 --> 02:30:04.792]  This all begins when you join a local group or start your own.
[02:30:05.392 --> 02:30:07.053]  Once you're part of a group,
[02:30:10.262 --> 02:30:10.823]  Town halls.
[02:30:11.423 --> 02:30:12.805]  Members of Congress will hold them.
[02:30:13.065 --> 02:30:16.569]  You just have to show up and use the public comment section to voice your opinion.
[02:30:17.129 --> 02:30:17.830]  Public events.
[02:30:18.531 --> 02:30:21.815]  Your members of Congress will be out there cutting ribbons and kissing babies.
[02:30:22.475 --> 02:30:32.026]  You need to be there asking the smart questions and holding them accountable to issues they are on the wrong side of, or thanking them for being on the right side in hard times.
[02:30:32.646 --> 02:30:33.347]  Office visits.
[02:30:33.747 --> 02:30:38.411]  Members of Congress take meetings, schedule one, or just show up and bring some friends.
[02:30:39.011 --> 02:30:42.614]  Let them know you care, you vote, and you are watching them.
[02:30:43.214 --> 02:30:43.635]  Call them.
[02:30:44.115 --> 02:30:52.262]  Work with local groups to participate in mass call days so your members of Congress can't ignore their constant ringing phones and full voicemail boxes.
[02:30:52.922 --> 02:30:57.468]  Over half a million individuals have already downloaded the guide.
[02:30:57.668 --> 02:31:01.212]  Over 100,000 people have signed up in every congressional district in the country.
[02:31:01.433 --> 02:31:04.857]  And over 3,000 groups have registered in every state in the nation.
[02:31:05.438 --> 02:31:09.763]  This is needed even if your senators and representatives are on the right side of the issues.
[02:31:10.123 --> 02:31:10.964]  We will chase them down.
[02:31:10.984 --> 02:31:13.826]  Go to meetings in towns we don't even live in.
[02:31:13.886 --> 02:31:15.427]  Because we have to herd the sheep.
[02:31:15.447 --> 02:31:15.988]  Ugh, the long haul.
[02:31:16.008 --> 02:31:16.148]  Ugh.
[02:31:42.098 --> 02:31:43.125]  Let's get to work!
[02:31:45.034 --> 02:31:52.596]  So that, you know, they're a brave new film, so it just kind of lets you know the brave new world that they want to create by using the doublespeak.
[02:31:52.616 --> 02:32:04.599]  So obviously that video was really great because the crew actually picked it up and they re-edited it and put the piece out to kind of show you exactly what these Obama-linked activists are up to.
[02:32:04.639 --> 02:32:13.801]  They're fighting for communism, they're burning down their cities, they're rioting, they're slapping and beating women and attacking people with shovels.
[02:32:14.701 --> 02:32:24.028]  Total hypocrisy there, just like the fact that we have these cinemas wanting to air 1984 as a Trump protest.
[02:32:24.088 --> 02:32:25.469]  It's total hypocrisy.
[02:32:25.489 --> 02:32:29.091]  And it's lost on them, almost.
[02:32:29.171 --> 02:32:33.334]  It seems as if they don't even realize how completely backwards everything is.
[02:32:33.654 --> 02:32:37.737]  And I truly think it's because, for so long, we have seen these groups
[02:32:38.657 --> 02:32:51.288]  Trying to control the words, the words that you're allowed to speak, controlling the language and mixing people up and telling you you can't be racist against white people and just totally making things up and then adding them to the dictionary.
[02:32:51.789 --> 02:32:53.510]  To me, it's insane.
[02:32:53.911 --> 02:33:01.037]  So I just wanted to let you guys know that we here are going to continue to pump out the truth news as best we are able to.
[02:33:01.057 --> 02:33:02.919]  You know, we're under attack.
[02:33:02.959 --> 02:33:03.879]  We've been under attack.
[02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:21.172]  Well, for the last year, of course, as we dared to come after Hillary Clinton and dared to put out the videos of her and her ill health, we've really suffered a lot of internet hack attacks as well as things like that, but now this has gone to the next level with them taking out one of our supply
[02:33:21.952 --> 02:33:23.233]  Thank you so much!
[02:33:40.330 --> 02:33:41.931]  Kudos to you, globalists, for this one.
[02:33:41.971 --> 02:33:54.521]  But any attack that Alex Jones has suffered, or anyone really that's truly fighting for truth and liberty, it seems to... I see Alex, he just absorbs it, and it just makes him stronger.
[02:33:54.942 --> 02:33:58.625]  And it's really incredible, so it'll be interesting to see what happens here.
[02:33:59.025 --> 02:34:00.746]  But we need your support now more than ever.
[02:34:00.806 --> 02:34:04.589]  That's why we're doing this in the defense of Liberty 13-hour broadcast.
[02:34:04.849 --> 02:34:05.790]  That's why we're all here.
[02:34:05.850 --> 02:34:07.792]  We rallied at the very last minute.
[02:34:08.152 --> 02:34:12.274]  We've got specials live right now at the Info Wars store.
[02:34:12.294 --> 02:34:15.755]  33% off of silver bullet colloidal silver.
[02:34:15.775 --> 02:34:20.357]  25% off of super male vitality brain force survival shield.
[02:34:20.697 --> 02:34:22.858]  The caveman is 33% off.
[02:34:22.918 --> 02:34:27.080]  I know Owen Schroer is really getting after that caveman and trying to get me to do it too.
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:28.181]  He's like, isn't it vegan?
[02:34:28.201 --> 02:34:32.462]  I'm like, no, actually it's made with cartilage and bone broth.
[02:34:32.903 --> 02:34:35.324]  But you know, I guess for a man, a caveman,
[02:34:36.044 --> 02:34:36.865]  That is vegan.
[02:34:36.945 --> 02:34:40.327]  Well, all that calcium and stuff is really good for women too, though.
[02:34:40.407 --> 02:34:41.308]  Yes, very good.
[02:34:41.328 --> 02:34:44.451]  It could help maybe even prevent osteoporosis.
[02:34:44.651 --> 02:34:47.493]  Right, and I know it's great for your hair.
[02:34:47.913 --> 02:34:58.482]  A girlfriend of mine just had a baby, and it's actually the bone broth that she's taking and also giving to the baby that's really helped with some of his intestinal issues that I know a lot of babies have.
[02:34:59.062 --> 02:34:59.742]  We need your help.
[02:35:00.002 --> 02:35:01.543]  We are not establishment funded.
[02:35:01.603 --> 02:35:04.844]  We are not getting money from the mega banks or Big Pharma.
[02:35:05.124 --> 02:35:08.365]  We are powered solely by your support.
[02:35:08.885 --> 02:35:10.405]  So go to the InfoWars store.
[02:35:10.746 --> 02:35:12.966]  Take advantage of these mega specials.
[02:35:13.086 --> 02:35:14.347]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:35:14.527 --> 02:35:18.528]  Share this link on your social media and review our products.
[02:35:19.008 --> 02:35:30.972]  On your Facebook page, if you're willing to go and review our products at InfowarsStore.com, we love that as well, especially those five-star reviews, but share your review on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram.
[02:35:31.292 --> 02:35:38.494]  Take over their channels and let people see, you know, if you're saying this is a great taste, great product, I'd definitely try it again.
[02:35:39.175 --> 02:35:46.237]  Put this review out on Facebook or somewhere where other people who now aren't going to be able to see it because they're not getting the ad roll,
[02:35:47.157 --> 02:35:50.980]  Let them see that you really enjoy these products and that you would highly recommend them.
[02:35:51.020 --> 02:35:52.321]  We need to take over their channels.
[02:35:52.421 --> 02:36:06.590]  Exactly, and even if you have a bunch of the Iodine X2, buy some for a friend or a neighbor or a family member as a gift because, you know, it is so important to have iodine in our diets.
[02:36:06.650 --> 02:36:11.193]  Most people don't really realize how depleted, especially if they're living in the goiter belt.
[02:36:11.713 --> 02:36:14.756]  So, I mean, that's really important to make sure you have iodine in.
[02:36:14.836 --> 02:36:20.722]  And remember, guys, we are the people's media, just like Donald Trump is the people's president.
[02:36:20.742 --> 02:36:23.765]  So if you want to keep us going, you've got to help us out.
[02:36:24.085 --> 02:36:26.207]  Yes, and take advantage of these mega specials.
[02:36:26.247 --> 02:36:27.028]  We thank you guys.
[02:36:27.388 --> 02:36:30.271]  We've got, what have we got, like six, seven more hours to go.
[02:36:30.351 --> 02:36:31.071]  We'll all be here.
[02:36:31.091 --> 02:36:34.935]  So we're going to take a quick break, and then we will see you on the flip side.
[02:36:34.975 --> 02:36:35.576]  We'll be right back.
[02:36:51.312 --> 02:36:57.477]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:36:57.857 --> 02:37:00.739]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:37:01.099 --> 02:37:06.303]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:37:06.703 --> 02:37:12.667]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:37:12.828 --> 02:37:15.950]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:17.551]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[02:37:17.751 --> 02:37:21.894]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:37:22.094 --> 02:37:24.956]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:37:25.036 --> 02:37:26.597]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:37:26.697 --> 02:37:29.879]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:37:30.159 --> 02:37:32.480]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:33.741]  It's in powder form.
[02:37:33.821 --> 02:37:36.503]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:37:36.523 --> 02:37:37.303]  I take this.
[02:37:37.423 --> 02:37:39.104]  This is the product that I take.
[02:37:39.224 --> 02:37:41.186]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:37:42.026 --> 02:37:42.807]  We fight the Globals.
[02:37:42.827 --> 02:37:43.667]  We fight the New World Order.
[02:37:43.967 --> 02:37:48.170]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:37:51.408 --> 02:37:59.530]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[02:38:00.511 --> 02:38:05.152]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption.
[02:38:05.732 --> 02:38:09.313]  And a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[02:38:09.713 --> 02:38:13.594]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[02:38:13.674 --> 02:38:16.675]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up in their face.
[02:38:16.695 --> 02:38:18.176]  We now have George Soros.
[02:38:19.276 --> 02:38:20.037]  As a goblin.
[02:38:20.697 --> 02:38:26.482]  On the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[02:38:27.243 --> 02:38:31.606]  It says, deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[02:38:33.848 --> 02:38:40.934]  So, it is a limited edition, deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right-hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[02:38:41.294 --> 02:38:41.835]  It's powerful.
[02:38:41.855 --> 02:38:42.936]  I hope you get out to everybody you know.
[02:38:43.196 --> 02:38:44.957]  InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[02:38:54.619 --> 02:38:55.739]  It's never going to get any better.
[02:38:56.139 --> 02:38:56.859]  Don't look for it.
[02:38:57.279 --> 02:38:58.420]  Be happy with what you got.
[02:38:59.540 --> 02:39:02.620]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[02:39:03.161 --> 02:39:04.821]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[02:39:05.201 --> 02:39:06.261]  The real owners.
[02:39:06.341 --> 02:39:10.862]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[02:39:11.242 --> 02:39:12.482]  Forget the politicians.
[02:39:12.702 --> 02:39:15.963]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[02:39:17.543 --> 02:39:17.963]  You don't.
[02:39:18.763 --> 02:39:19.743]  You have no choice.
[02:39:20.124 --> 02:39:21.044]  You have owners.
[02:39:21.364 --> 02:39:22.284]  They own you.
[02:39:23.615 --> 02:39:24.917]  They own everything.
[02:39:25.157 --> 02:39:26.799]  They own all the important land.
[02:39:27.159 --> 02:39:28.902]  They own and control the corporations.
[02:39:28.942 --> 02:39:32.406]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls.
[02:39:32.426 --> 02:39:34.008]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[02:39:34.348 --> 02:39:39.154]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[02:39:39.334 --> 02:39:40.977]  They got you by the balls!
[02:39:42.461 --> 02:39:44.563]  They want obedient workers.
[02:39:45.003 --> 02:39:46.504]  Obedient workers.
[02:39:46.824 --> 02:39:59.573]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[02:39:59.593 --> 02:40:05.958]  And now, they're coming for your social security money, so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[02:40:07.379 --> 02:40:08.280]  It's a big club.
[02:40:09.266 --> 02:40:09.987]  And you ain't in it.
[02:40:10.247 --> 02:40:15.632]  And you said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[02:40:15.972 --> 02:40:16.853]  You better believe it.
[02:40:16.953 --> 02:40:18.834]  So what specifically did they do?
[02:40:19.275 --> 02:40:24.419]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand.
[02:40:24.439 --> 02:40:25.280]  A lot of money.
[02:40:25.901 --> 02:40:28.603]  You and I are not in the big club.
[02:40:28.963 --> 02:40:30.905]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[02:40:31.546 --> 02:40:35.249]  It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[02:40:36.667 --> 02:40:38.148]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[02:40:38.168 --> 02:40:42.009]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[02:40:42.029 --> 02:40:45.951]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[02:40:45.971 --> 02:40:46.972]  They're not interested in that.
[02:40:47.212 --> 02:40:48.152]  That doesn't help them.
[02:40:48.532 --> 02:40:49.893]  That's against their interest.
[02:40:50.393 --> 02:40:50.833]  That's right.
[02:40:51.094 --> 02:40:56.076]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:41:05.020 --> 02:41:07.542]  All right, welcome back to InfoWars.com.
[02:41:07.582 --> 02:41:11.124]  This is the Defense of Liberty 13-hour broadcast.
[02:41:11.264 --> 02:41:14.266]  Millie Weaver joins myself, Leanne McAdoo.
[02:41:14.586 --> 02:41:15.967]  So great to be here with you, Leanne.
[02:41:16.027 --> 02:41:24.972]  Yes, and so great to be here with all of you guys out there sticking with us all of these years and of course through these mega broadcasts that we do from time to time.
[02:41:25.372 --> 02:41:29.175]  Alex Jones had to rally the troops at the last minute after this hit.
[02:41:29.955 --> 02:41:35.437]  From the globalists, I mean being banned from one of the largest online advertising platforms, that is huge!
[02:41:35.537 --> 02:41:36.737]  Google just making the decision.
[02:41:37.117 --> 02:41:49.541]  First they roll out their little fake news filter and they're gonna do their fake news fact check so that they can filter the information that you're allowed to receive in your news feed or on your Google searches.
[02:41:50.201 --> 02:41:53.282]  But now they've just removed people entirely, people they don't agree with.
[02:41:53.902 --> 02:41:54.623]  What's next?
[02:41:54.723 --> 02:41:56.784]  Are we gonna get kicked off of YouTube?
[02:41:56.844 --> 02:42:01.287]  Are we gonna get kicked off of Twitter, Facebook, all the different social media sites?
[02:42:01.427 --> 02:42:02.888]  I mean, is this just the beginning?
[02:42:02.948 --> 02:42:05.910]  Are we gonna see an all-out ban and censorship?
[02:42:06.131 --> 02:42:15.517]  This is exactly why they wanted to get us all dependent on their platforms so that they can then yank the plug out from underneath us and choose to censor who they want to.
[02:42:15.697 --> 02:42:16.238]  Exactly.
[02:42:16.378 --> 02:42:21.942]  And this is what's so frightening is that this is the America that they're fighting for and that they've got
[02:42:22.702 --> 02:42:28.844]  They've rallied up their little rainbow-haired SJWs to help fight this attack.
[02:42:29.125 --> 02:42:31.926]  Keith Olbermann is the new revolution.
[02:42:33.566 --> 02:42:35.187]  It's absolutely insane.
[02:42:35.527 --> 02:42:43.090]  These are the people that have been inside their little safe spaces at the university who think that now they have inherited the earth.
[02:42:43.290 --> 02:42:44.310]  That it's theirs now.
[02:42:44.670 --> 02:42:45.951]  It's their time to rule.
[02:42:46.431 --> 02:42:47.972]  Their little vegan anarchy.
[02:42:48.212 --> 02:42:48.592]  Exactly.
[02:42:48.592 --> 02:42:48.772]  Exactly.
[02:42:48.792 --> 02:42:53.977]  What's so terrifying to know is that actually the numbers are pretty scary.
[02:42:54.077 --> 02:43:05.869]  I mean, millennials, it's mostly, you know, as horrible as it sounds, and I know I'm a millennial, it's mostly the millennials who are actually the ones buying into communism and socialism.
[02:43:06.269 --> 02:43:08.211]  The numbers and statistics are alarming.
[02:43:08.451 --> 02:43:14.477]  Millennials actually really do believe that socialism just means being more generous.
[02:43:14.617 --> 02:43:21.364]  And it just, you know, they don't even know the real numbers on how many deaths were the result of communism.
[02:43:21.644 --> 02:43:24.926]  Right, and they only want to look at countries where it's been successful.
[02:43:24.946 --> 02:43:33.652]  They don't want to look at Venezuela, where people have lost, on average, 19 pounds in the last year because they have no food to eat.
[02:43:34.093 --> 02:43:39.196]  They're killing the animals that are in the zoos because they have no food.
[02:43:39.476 --> 02:43:43.619]  And the government, the great socialist government, is rationing out the food.
[02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:50.346]  With so little, people can't eat, they can't feed their families, they're digging in the trash.
[02:43:50.707 --> 02:43:59.016]  And so these young people, they don't want to look at the failed systems that are repeated throughout history.
[02:43:59.037 --> 02:44:04.883]  They don't want to look at the millions, tens of millions of people, hundreds of millions of people actually that have been killed.
[02:44:06.144 --> 02:44:27.897]  And they think it means a forced equality and to an extent it does, but I really find it hard to believe that in the food shortage in Venezuela that the wealthy bureaucrats and politicians were going without or that their food rations were the same size as the poor little families out there food rations.
[02:44:27.997 --> 02:44:29.438]  Well no, exactly.
[02:44:30.358 --> 02:44:32.480]  I can't, the name escapes me right now, but the
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:50.332]  The president that just died and left all billions of dollars to his daughter while the country is in crisis and you have the people there at their parties and they've got the food piled high on their plates and these just amazing displays of sweets.
[02:44:50.412 --> 02:44:57.277]  It's just like the Hunger Games where the people they drink the special drink that helps them vomit so that they can eat even more.
[02:44:57.597 --> 02:45:01.300]  And then they laugh about the fact that the people are starving out there in the other camps.
[02:45:01.340 --> 02:45:02.701]  I mean, this is insanity.
[02:45:03.081 --> 02:45:08.325]  And for some reason, young people have been convinced that that just can't happen here.
[02:45:08.385 --> 02:45:12.988]  That the people who are in power right now, that was my big issue with Bernie Sanders supporters.
[02:45:13.048 --> 02:45:16.111]  And if you would ask them that, it shuts them down.
[02:45:16.131 --> 02:45:24.537]  It's like, you think the system's so corrupt, the government is so bad, the people in charge are so terrible, the corporations are so bad, and they care so little about the people and the earth.
[02:45:25.057 --> 02:45:28.640]  So why do you want to give them even more power and even more money?
[02:45:29.101 --> 02:45:30.882]  And then they just go, huh?
[02:45:31.343 --> 02:45:33.305]  Well, Bernie Sanders will fix everything!
[02:45:33.325 --> 02:45:38.990]  Yeah, and this is just the result of the failed education system in America.
[02:45:39.010 --> 02:45:41.632]  I mean, it's pretty sad.
[02:45:42.132 --> 02:45:49.759]  They've been putting in basically leftist indoctrinating beliefs into the schools, and I even remember it, you know.
[02:45:50.820 --> 02:45:54.222]  All the teachers were pretty much, you know, explaining Democrats, Republicans.
[02:45:54.242 --> 02:46:03.568]  I even remember a teacher pretty much telling everyone that unless you were rich and greedy that you needed to be a liberal and a Democrat.
[02:46:03.648 --> 02:46:03.768]  Right.
[02:46:03.788 --> 02:46:05.229]  And then most of the kids all fell in line.
[02:46:05.309 --> 02:46:06.610]  Oh yeah, I'm not rich and greedy.
[02:46:07.151 --> 02:46:09.112]  You know, I'm going to be a Democrat then.
[02:46:09.152 --> 02:46:12.174]  And then they start to kind of form their minds around that.
[02:46:12.814 --> 02:46:22.381]  It also reminds me of the fact that they're now pushing this environmental education, green energy education, into the school systems today.
[02:46:22.401 --> 02:46:29.966]  And what's really scary about it is, under the guise of green energy environmental education curriculum,
[02:46:30.666 --> 02:46:36.150]  They're actually putting in communist belief systems and they're putting it in the literature.
[02:46:36.170 --> 02:46:40.633]  Telling people they need to live in their little communist blocks and that the government will take care of them.
[02:46:41.014 --> 02:46:52.082]  Meanwhile, the people who actually live in these communist blocks are like complaining because the walls are crumbling down around them with roaches and they can never get out of them and they have to leave them to their families and six of them live in these little... Exactly.
[02:46:52.362 --> 02:46:53.303]  So it's like, okay...
[02:46:53.863 --> 02:47:05.927]  If you have elementary or middle school aged children, ask them, are they teaching you about environmental education and green energy and all these things in school?
[02:47:05.987 --> 02:47:21.712]  And I almost guarantee you, your children are going to say yes, especially if you live in Oregon because it's now become a law that they have to talk about green energy and they're going to try to make it a mandatory curriculum to have to take in order to exit and
[02:47:22.392 --> 02:47:22.612]  You know.
[02:47:22.632 --> 02:47:23.113]  To graduate.
[02:47:23.133 --> 02:47:24.593]  To graduate from high school.
[02:47:24.613 --> 02:47:31.218]  Here's the thing that it just really infuriates me because I was like the kid who would go around and spend my weekends picking up trash.
[02:47:31.278 --> 02:47:36.781]  Myself and my best friend, I lived on an island and it was beautiful and still to this day it infuriates me when people litter.
[02:47:36.801 --> 02:47:37.182]  I think how
[02:47:37.742 --> 02:47:41.724]  Freaking devolved are you that you can't just take your trash to the garbage can.
[02:47:42.025 --> 02:47:44.066]  So he would like pick up trash and stuff.
[02:47:44.086 --> 02:47:45.507]  I care about the environment.
[02:47:45.547 --> 02:47:46.707]  I care about the animals.
[02:47:46.767 --> 02:47:49.309]  I care about the sea creatures and humans and humanity.
[02:47:49.649 --> 02:47:50.409]  I love this earth.
[02:47:50.449 --> 02:47:51.170]  I love this world.
[02:47:51.210 --> 02:47:54.932]  So when we're talking about this, it's not like, oh my God, green energy, blah.
[02:47:55.252 --> 02:47:56.193]  But the point is,
[02:47:56.713 --> 02:48:10.096]  We see how they really care about the environment because, for instance, all of the green plans that they had with solar panels and electric cars, it was so effective that it was taking money away from the people who are in power.
[02:48:10.356 --> 02:48:12.896]  And so they had to roll that, pull it back a little bit.
[02:48:13.196 --> 02:48:14.096]  Oh, that's too effective.
[02:48:14.396 --> 02:48:19.697]  Now we need to start taxing people who have these electric cars because they're not having to pay for gas.
[02:48:19.957 --> 02:48:21.398]  So they're not supporting our system.
[02:48:21.658 --> 02:48:22.658]  Let's roll that back.
[02:48:22.958 --> 02:48:23.138]  Exactly.
[02:48:39.228 --> 02:48:43.590]  And they don't even talk about Fukushima because it doesn't match their agenda.
[02:48:43.850 --> 02:48:48.773]  They only will ever talk about fracking and oil and coal plants and things like that.
[02:48:49.153 --> 02:48:51.714]  And people, you know, cow farts and whatever and whatnot.
[02:48:51.934 --> 02:48:59.057]  They're not going to talk about something like the fact that Fukushima has been melting down and completely radiating the ocean, causing all kinds of problems.
[02:48:59.417 --> 02:49:07.281]  But the main point here is that they're using this green energy, green party type curriculum in the schools.
[02:49:08.001 --> 02:49:12.244]  While promoting communism through that curriculum.
[02:49:12.684 --> 02:49:17.768]  When have we ever allowed anyone to try and have a curriculum?
[02:49:17.808 --> 02:49:26.774]  Could you imagine if the curriculum was called democratic curriculum or liberal curriculum or Republican Party curriculum?
[02:49:26.854 --> 02:49:29.936]  People would be like, no way we want politics out of school.
[02:49:30.337 --> 02:49:31.157]  And that's the problem.
[02:49:31.197 --> 02:49:32.558]  They're putting it back in.
[02:49:32.598 --> 02:49:35.100]  So are we going to see a bunch of young people now
[02:49:36.721 --> 02:49:37.322]  I don't know.
[02:49:55.322 --> 02:49:55.442]  Okay.
[02:50:15.390 --> 02:50:29.842]  The fact that they are wanting to replace lazy Americans, as Bill Kristol calls us, lazy Americans with the new Americans, which will be the refugees, the illegal immigrants, the people that have no ties to the Constitution.
[02:50:29.882 --> 02:50:32.143]  They don't care about what this country was founded on.
[02:50:32.464 --> 02:50:43.493]  They want to come here and they want to take Social Security benefits without even a Social Security number and take advantage of the welfare and, you know, bring their kids here and give them a free education.
[02:50:44.423 --> 02:50:49.531]  And a lot of them just even, you know, some, I do agree, don't care.
[02:50:49.711 --> 02:50:52.896]  But there's a good percentage that actually just don't know.
[02:50:53.076 --> 02:50:57.623]  They don't really know what their rights are and some of them aren't really even that fluent in English.
[02:50:57.943 --> 02:50:59.345]  So the problem is, is this.
[02:50:59.966 --> 02:51:18.460]  You know, when we had more legal immigration requirements and people were forced to abide by that in order to come here, they were forced to learn about our way of government, about the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and about what rights they would then obtain by becoming a citizen.
[02:51:18.820 --> 02:51:28.789]  When you allow illegal immigration, the problem is you're bringing a bunch of people here who have no idea what America stands for and what the rights are that they would have here.
[02:51:28.809 --> 02:51:30.050]  So that's the problem.
[02:51:30.390 --> 02:51:33.733]  They may not know that they even have the rights that they're voting away.
[02:51:34.013 --> 02:51:34.073]  And
[02:51:55.011 --> 02:51:55.231]  I think so.
[02:52:11.619 --> 02:52:13.561]  It's amazing to me.
[02:52:13.621 --> 02:52:26.833]  So Mexicans fear deportee and refugee camps could be popping up along their northern border under the Trump administration's plan to start deporting to Mexico all Latin Americans and others who entered the U.S.
[02:52:26.893 --> 02:52:27.994]  illegally through this country.
[02:52:28.034 --> 02:52:30.437]  So they call them other than Mexicans.
[02:52:30.677 --> 02:52:33.880]  So those people typically get flown back to their homelands.
[02:52:34.340 --> 02:52:37.003]  But now there's a sweeping rewrite of enforcement
[02:52:37.703 --> 02:52:38.624]  I don't know.
[02:52:56.320 --> 02:53:02.082]  Okay, first of all, they have no ties to the United States either, and they're not migrants.
[02:53:02.102 --> 02:53:04.283]  They're people who came here illegally.
[02:53:04.323 --> 02:53:08.124]  Yes, they migrated through the countries to get here, but they have no ties to the U.S.
[02:53:08.224 --> 02:53:08.445]  either.
[02:53:08.785 --> 02:53:09.005]  Why?
[02:53:09.185 --> 02:53:11.986]  What's the difference between Mexico versus the United States?
[02:53:12.026 --> 02:53:17.628]  Yeah, they're going to be there in a violence-plagued land on the other side of our border, but that's exactly what we're trying to keep out.
[02:53:17.728 --> 02:53:22.470]  And that's the risk that you take when you decide, I'm going to go somewhere costly.
[02:53:22.910 --> 02:53:23.471]  Illegally!
[02:53:23.491 --> 02:53:31.920]  You know, you might end up being deported and even into a neighboring country for the time being or something that you're not from.
[02:53:32.160 --> 02:53:37.527]  And that's just the sad reality of when you decide to break the law and try to come here.
[02:53:38.067 --> 02:53:39.247]  Yeah, I mean trust me.
[02:53:39.327 --> 02:53:42.448]  I have looked into moving out of this country since I was 18 years old.
[02:53:42.508 --> 02:53:43.729]  I just have it's been my dream.
[02:53:43.769 --> 02:53:46.489]  I just want to live in another country for just a little while.
[02:53:46.609 --> 02:53:56.072]  It's not easy if you do it legally and if you do it illegally you're going to get caught and you're gonna get kicked out and you could get banned for life from going to this place.
[02:53:56.132 --> 02:54:00.353]  Most countries require that you have a huge bank account and college degrees.
[02:54:00.393 --> 02:54:03.194]  They don't want just anyone coming into their country.
[02:54:03.234 --> 02:54:04.415]  They're sucking off their system.
[02:54:04.555 --> 02:54:06.576]  Just the United States, for whatever reason.
[02:54:06.616 --> 02:54:07.216]  Just Democrats.
[02:54:07.716 --> 02:54:09.397]  You know, just one more thing.
[02:54:10.257 --> 02:54:22.243]  It just really, you know, got me laughing a little bit inside, thinking about how, you know, all the liberals, you know, Miley Cyrus, all of them were saying, oh, we're going to leave the country if Donald Trump wins.
[02:54:22.303 --> 02:54:23.303]  Well, where'd you go?
[02:54:23.383 --> 02:54:25.044]  Did you guys go to another country?
[02:54:25.144 --> 02:54:30.427]  Because apparently, you know, some of them actually did try going to Canada.
[02:54:31.305 --> 02:54:32.006]  But it didn't happen.
[02:54:32.026 --> 02:54:32.987]  It didn't meet the requirements.
[02:54:33.007 --> 02:54:34.688]  Canada has a closed border, guys.
[02:54:34.848 --> 02:54:35.289]  Sorry.
[02:54:35.389 --> 02:54:36.530]  Most countries do.
[02:54:36.970 --> 02:54:38.912]  Yeah, and I've looked into Canada as well.
[02:54:38.952 --> 02:54:40.694]  You have to be under a certain age.
[02:54:40.714 --> 02:54:43.436]  You've got to hold at least a bachelor's degree.
[02:54:43.736 --> 02:54:45.258]  You've got to be able to have a job.
[02:54:45.298 --> 02:54:47.580]  They don't want just anyone coming into their country.
[02:54:47.940 --> 02:54:54.907]  So here, just going on with this article out of the AP, so we have a Mexico City-based security analyst, and he's really just
[02:54:55.727 --> 02:54:55.967]  That's
[02:55:16.753 --> 02:55:17.734]  We were overwhelmed.
[02:55:17.774 --> 02:55:18.714]  It was out of control.
[02:55:18.794 --> 02:55:22.236]  Now imagine a situation 10 or 15 times that size.
[02:55:22.576 --> 02:55:25.257]  There aren't enough resources to maintain them.
[02:55:25.657 --> 02:55:26.558]  We've got to house them.
[02:55:26.598 --> 02:55:27.438]  We've got to feed them.
[02:55:27.458 --> 02:55:28.539]  We've got to put them in tents.
[02:55:29.359 --> 02:55:29.979]  School them.
[02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:30.940]  They have children.
[02:55:32.805 --> 02:55:33.926]  Oh, exactly!
[02:55:34.106 --> 02:55:35.608]  Now you feel our pain.
[02:55:35.648 --> 02:55:39.472]  So this is, you know, six or seven thousand people that tried to get across the border.
[02:55:40.473 --> 02:55:42.114]  What about that every single day?
[02:55:42.455 --> 02:55:43.636]  Or at least every month?
[02:55:43.956 --> 02:55:46.138]  Hundreds of thousands in 2015, 2016.
[02:55:46.218 --> 02:55:49.702]  That's what we here in the United States are trying to say.
[02:55:49.982 --> 02:55:55.307]  In Texas, we refuse to take in refugees or refuse to become a sanctuary state.
[02:55:56.008 --> 02:56:00.230]  And yet, the federal government, under President Obama, forced them here anyway.
[02:56:00.290 --> 02:56:00.891]  And so guess what?
[02:56:00.971 --> 02:56:02.672]  That means we're paying for it.
[02:56:03.052 --> 02:56:05.173]  Even though Texas voted no on that.
[02:56:05.213 --> 02:56:05.773]  They don't care.
[02:56:05.793 --> 02:56:07.634]  They're still saying, you're going to pay for it.
[02:56:08.035 --> 02:56:10.956]  I mean, it's, it's, it's, you feel our pain now.
[02:56:11.076 --> 02:56:11.536]  Exactly.
[02:56:11.596 --> 02:56:12.057]  And you know what?
[02:56:12.157 --> 02:56:12.777]  We can't.
[02:56:12.937 --> 02:56:17.280]  In America, we cannot take in every single refugee in the world.
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:21.062]  Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to even survive.
[02:56:21.082 --> 02:56:23.243]  There are homeless people on the streets here.
[02:56:24.104 --> 02:56:34.682]  Um, it reminds me of that, that video, you know, the gumball video where this man was pouring in gumballs into this glass, basically showing that the number of
[02:56:36.274 --> 02:56:40.695]  Yes, the name of the video is Immigration Gumballs and Numbers.
[02:56:40.755 --> 02:56:44.676]  If you haven't seen it, you should really check it out because it is hilarious.
[02:56:44.756 --> 02:56:56.439]  I mean, this guy just completely shows how the false narrative of saying that we can just take in all of these people is just, it's really not reality.
[02:56:56.919 --> 02:56:59.540]  It's not really what we can even do in this country.
[02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:03.321]  I'll have to check that out because I haven't actually seen this one.
[02:57:03.341 --> 02:57:07.243]  Maybe we'll dive into it a little bit deeper coming up with McBreen.
[02:57:07.263 --> 02:57:08.984]  He's going to be joining us in studio.
[02:57:09.464 --> 02:57:10.445]  We'll check that out.
[02:57:10.745 --> 02:57:12.226]  I wanted to throw to this special report.
[02:57:12.246 --> 02:57:13.066]  We're going to take a little break.
[02:57:13.086 --> 02:57:13.867]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:57:13.887 --> 02:57:14.687]  He's in his car.
[02:57:15.307 --> 02:57:17.128]  Alex just never stops working.
[02:57:17.168 --> 02:57:18.989]  He cares about this country so much.
[02:57:21.878 --> 02:57:23.099]  He's on a boat, actually.
[02:57:23.119 --> 02:57:24.901]  Alex Jones is on a boat.
[02:57:25.001 --> 02:57:25.882]  He's on a boat.
[02:57:26.322 --> 02:57:31.446]  Anywhere, anytime the mood strikes, Alex Jones, he is going to fight for freedom.
[02:57:31.967 --> 02:57:33.468]  And this was a special report that he did.
[02:57:33.508 --> 02:57:35.509]  It's called, What Somalia Got Wrong.
[02:57:35.810 --> 02:57:43.936]  He's discussing the tremendous wealth, prosperity, and freedom in America that was built by an adherence to the liberty and classical liberalism.
[02:57:43.996 --> 02:57:45.458]  That's what we're talking about here, folks.
[02:57:45.478 --> 02:57:46.739]  So let's go ahead and roll that report.
[02:58:07.963 --> 02:58:10.965]  Is the sun setting on our Republic or is it rising?
[02:58:11.025 --> 02:58:16.728]  Well, technically on this Tuesday night in late February 2017, it's setting.
[02:58:17.728 --> 02:58:25.673]  But I wanted to title this video because my buddy had the idea to title it that.
[02:58:26.860 --> 02:58:28.100]  What, what Somalia is missing?
[02:58:29.081 --> 02:58:31.021]  Or what Somalia got wrong?
[02:58:31.801 --> 02:58:33.422]  And that's no bashing of Somalia.
[02:58:33.802 --> 02:58:35.042]  I wish Somalia does great.
[02:58:36.682 --> 02:58:39.643]  It's just that Somalia didn't ever get civilization down.
[02:58:40.443 --> 02:58:48.465]  And neither did the other seven countries or six countries that Trump is banning people from coming from because they don't have governments.
[02:58:48.565 --> 02:58:49.365]  They don't have states.
[02:58:49.385 --> 02:58:50.466]  They don't have real passports.
[02:58:50.486 --> 02:58:51.926]  They don't have real visas.
[02:58:53.453 --> 02:58:55.554]  Obama and others have banned those very same countries.
[02:58:56.615 --> 02:59:10.923]  But I just sit here thinking about the tremendous wealth where even blue-collar workers can go on vacations a couple times a year, drive a nice vehicle, have air conditioning, have medical care, and then have a little fishing boat.
[02:59:11.303 --> 02:59:17.467]  You know, a lot of these boats here are really fancy and nice, but most of them are owned by middle-class and working-class people.
[02:59:19.148 --> 02:59:22.330]  You don't see Cape Canaveral rocket-launching bases in Somalia.
[02:59:24.066 --> 02:59:25.927]  You don't see cat scans in Somalia.
[02:59:26.827 --> 02:59:28.868]  You don't see cancer treatments in Somalia.
[02:59:28.908 --> 02:59:32.770]  You don't see women walking around without hoods over their heads in Somalia.
[02:59:33.310 --> 02:59:35.411]  Or their genitals cut off by loppers at birth.
[02:59:37.492 --> 02:59:42.194]  You don't see dams built on rivers like Lake Travis in Somalia.
[02:59:42.754 --> 02:59:49.217]  You don't see jet airplanes flying up in the sky like that one way over there, probably 50 miles away in Somalia.
[02:59:56.519 --> 03:00:04.442]  But what you do see in Somalia is the antithesis of what the CIA were on feminist call for
[03:00:06.044 --> 03:00:18.828]  And that is a patriarchal run society completely by men, where if J-Lo's called for Somali refugees to be wide open to the U.S., she'd be kidnapped five minutes at the airport, maybe three minutes.
[03:00:19.628 --> 03:00:24.569]  I mean, they'd be guys with machine guns, probably the police at the airport, loading her in a rape van right away.
[03:00:24.589 --> 03:00:28.731]  And the media spends that because they're false disinformation news that I want her to be raped.
[03:00:28.771 --> 03:00:29.671]  I don't want her to be raped.
[03:00:30.171 --> 03:00:42.782]  I want her to stop raping my mind and raping our culture and telling me we should accept people who are a billion and a half people worldwide, most of them, who live like psychotic cavemen from some alternate dimension.
[03:00:44.163 --> 03:00:45.504]  So what went wrong with Somalia?
[03:00:47.126 --> 03:00:48.247]  What went wrong with
[03:00:49.591 --> 03:00:49.951]  Libya.
[03:00:49.971 --> 03:00:50.972]  What went wrong with those countries?
[03:00:51.973 --> 03:00:59.418]  Islam, under the orthodox system of the Wahhabis, that's the Sunni religion, 80% of Islam, is running around like cancer through the body.
[03:01:00.179 --> 03:01:06.404]  And the left has run up the white flag and said, we're going to put a jibz on in New York, or DC, or Berlin, Germany.
[03:01:06.864 --> 03:01:07.865]  The videos are out every day.
[03:01:07.885 --> 03:01:09.146]  There's so many of them, I don't even cover them.
[03:01:10.270 --> 03:01:15.171]  They have record rapes in Sweden, record houses being burned down, cars being burned.
[03:01:15.732 --> 03:01:24.174]  It's like every night for weeks, and Trump this weekend says, you know, you saw what's happening right now in Sweden, and the media knows the public's hunting for him.
[03:01:24.194 --> 03:01:24.854]  They go, what?
[03:01:24.874 --> 03:01:25.754]  What happened in Sweden?
[03:01:25.774 --> 03:01:26.415]  Did you do something?
[03:01:26.435 --> 03:01:29.876]  And they make little jokes, and Colbert makes jokes, all big jokes.
[03:01:30.596 --> 03:01:34.117]  Meanwhile, major cities in Sweden are on fire right now.
[03:01:35.382 --> 03:01:40.945]  And women are grabbed at like age 15 and put into Islamic sex slavery, which under Islam is okay if they're non-Islamic women.
[03:01:41.205 --> 03:01:44.846]  But even if they are Islamic women, they can be raped, killed, tortured, burned to death, you name it.
[03:01:45.226 --> 03:01:46.027]  They don't submit to it.
[03:01:46.087 --> 03:01:51.289]  So, I oppose globalism and communism because it's an oppressive, collectivist, centralized system.
[03:01:51.829 --> 03:01:53.710]  But why is Islam so allied with that?
[03:01:53.790 --> 03:01:56.952]  Well, because orthodox Islam is a collectivist, centralized system as well.
[03:01:58.232 --> 03:02:03.976]  And I was against all those wars in Iraq and places because I saw those as secular governments that have been battling radical Islam.
[03:02:04.677 --> 03:02:15.644]  And that's why the globalists allowed radical Islam to attack us on 9-11 and the inside job so that we could be directed against civil wars actually to bring down secular countries like we've seen in Syria, like we've seen in Libya.
[03:02:15.924 --> 03:02:16.885]  That's the larger paradigm.
[03:02:16.925 --> 03:02:17.505]  Here's the good news.
[03:02:17.806 --> 03:02:25.511]  That whole program is coming to a big screeching halt and Obama and Hillary and John Kerry's program of that is falling.
[03:02:27.728 --> 03:02:28.629]  So that's the good news.
[03:02:29.269 --> 03:02:31.211]  I just want to encourage all of you.
[03:02:31.231 --> 03:02:32.832]  I know most of you are informed.
[03:02:32.852 --> 03:02:34.173]  I'm not talking to the folks who are informed.
[03:02:34.793 --> 03:02:42.159]  I'm talking to the prodigal sons, who have not been rebels in their time, but who have been particular dumbasses.
[03:02:43.339 --> 03:02:49.144]  I want you to really understand that the social engineers like Zuckerberg that calls you a dumb effer and
[03:02:50.462 --> 03:02:52.604]  Schmidt and all the rest of them literally think you're idiots.
[03:02:53.465 --> 03:02:59.129]  And they're not flooding the West with 5 million Islamicists in the last few years because they want to play tiddlywinks.
[03:02:59.690 --> 03:03:09.538]  They're bringing in totally incompatible groups so they can then call, because of the crises that are going to unfold, for a culture of censorship that's not an open, Western, inclusive civilization.
[03:03:10.973 --> 03:03:12.193]  And I'm not against the Muslims.
[03:03:12.213 --> 03:03:19.555]  You know, the higher caste, that's in their own words, Muslims, come here, doctors, lawyers, you name it, who want to actually get away from Islam.
[03:03:19.855 --> 03:03:20.735]  They're called heretics.
[03:03:20.795 --> 03:03:25.437]  They may still, for traditionalist reasons, support their family and Islam and God and the God of Abraham.
[03:03:25.477 --> 03:03:27.717]  And there's certainly connections there with Judaism and Christianity.
[03:03:27.737 --> 03:03:28.597]  I don't want to fight with Muslims.
[03:03:29.638 --> 03:03:38.540]  But the point is, is that they are brought here to be a destabilizing effect and to cause crises in our civilization.
[03:03:38.580 --> 03:03:39.180]  And that's a fact.
[03:03:40.956 --> 03:03:51.423]  And so when you see the sick vision of a bunch of women chanting Allah Akbar, putting hijabs on their heads, it's nothing but cuckold, Stockholm Syndrome BS.
[03:03:52.264 --> 03:03:55.346]  And these people have to be rejected fundamentally.
[03:03:55.366 --> 03:03:57.827]  Now this is not even a hard thing to understand.
[03:03:58.728 --> 03:03:59.869]  But it's all just peer pressure.
[03:03:59.909 --> 03:04:01.510]  You're getting a worthless college degree.
[03:04:02.030 --> 03:04:05.433]  How do they screw you up mentally so you don't know you got screwed over with that degree?
[03:04:06.233 --> 03:04:06.974]  They teach you?
[03:04:08.343 --> 03:04:11.345]  That, you know, you're about to chip on your shoulder because of white males or whatever.
[03:04:11.945 --> 03:04:18.209]  Meanwhile, all the big smart white males that are part of the system are actually using race-based divide-and-conquer to control people.
[03:04:19.029 --> 03:04:24.973]  So again, answer my question for all of you that want to live in North Africa or the Middle East and think it's this wonderful thing.
[03:04:28.968 --> 03:04:31.410]  Why did modern slavery get invented by the Muslims?
[03:04:32.090 --> 03:04:34.732]  And why are so many black Muslims black Muslims?
[03:04:35.612 --> 03:04:37.313]  Why is ignorance at such a premium?
[03:04:37.353 --> 03:04:49.061]  And why do so many dumbasses want to destroy the West that produced all this wealth and has the highest grade of availability for the general public to have success in this system?
[03:04:50.061 --> 03:04:53.904]  You just sit around and bitch all day about, hey, somebody's got a big boat and I don't.
[03:04:57.679 --> 03:05:00.761]  But when you go to Somalia, they don't manufacture boats.
[03:05:01.061 --> 03:05:02.162]  They don't buy boats.
[03:05:02.222 --> 03:05:05.585]  They rob them out of the ocean.
[03:05:07.466 --> 03:05:08.167]  Out of the Gulf.
[03:05:08.287 --> 03:05:10.588]  Out of the Indian Ocean.
[03:05:11.509 --> 03:05:12.790]  They don't produce anything.
[03:05:13.030 --> 03:05:14.972]  They can't even produce clothes in Somalia.
[03:05:15.472 --> 03:05:16.893]  They can't produce toilet paper.
[03:05:17.233 --> 03:05:19.635]  They wipe their asses with their left hand.
[03:05:21.636 --> 03:05:24.999]  And why does the West want to commit suicide and embrace this stuff?
[03:05:27.403 --> 03:05:28.964]  Because the globalists have stolen the future.
[03:05:29.004 --> 03:05:30.105]  They've stolen civilization.
[03:05:30.405 --> 03:05:37.591]  They want us so butthurt and so mentally ill and so self-loving, we don't stand up and have our own self-preservation instincts and skills.
[03:05:38.151 --> 03:05:39.172]  And that's why this is happening.
[03:05:39.532 --> 03:05:39.933]  So again...
[03:05:41.414 --> 03:05:46.059]  Why isn't there technology coming out of the Islamistist countries?
[03:05:46.479 --> 03:05:47.981]  Why isn't it coming out of other areas?
[03:05:48.401 --> 03:05:56.009]  And why does everybody want to destroy the West, when the West has had its technology hijacked, not to empower the planet, but to bring in a corporate world government?
[03:05:56.269 --> 03:05:58.371]  InfoWars has been massively censored today.
[03:05:58.932 --> 03:06:02.135]  We have Google, a proprietary subcompany,
[03:06:04.648 --> 03:06:07.271]  AdRoll banned us after almost three years with them.
[03:06:07.932 --> 03:06:11.175]  We were set to make $5 million in 2017 off these ads.
[03:06:11.195 --> 03:06:12.036]  They'll fund our operations.
[03:06:12.056 --> 03:06:12.556]  Sounds like a lot.
[03:06:12.596 --> 03:06:12.857]  It's not.
[03:06:16.960 --> 03:06:19.682]  3.3 million last year, and they just banned us saying you're fake news.
[03:06:19.742 --> 03:06:21.584]  They just defined us as subhuman.
[03:06:21.844 --> 03:06:23.285]  No court, no proof, no nothing.
[03:06:23.505 --> 03:06:24.786]  And they said they want it for everybody.
[03:06:25.066 --> 03:06:25.746]  Well, you're next.
[03:06:25.786 --> 03:06:26.367]  Hey, don't worry.
[03:06:27.127 --> 03:06:27.768]  I will adapt.
[03:06:27.908 --> 03:06:28.588]  I will overcome.
[03:06:28.789 --> 03:06:29.729]  I will defeat this.
[03:06:30.250 --> 03:06:35.353]  But I understand that for the general public, it's meant to intimidate everybody and shut down free speech so they can win.
[03:06:36.434 --> 03:06:43.499]  That's why I want my 50-plus reporters and crew to raise more capital to go to the next level this year, because they've already seen us kick their ass.
[03:06:43.719 --> 03:06:44.820]  They ignored us before.
[03:06:45.717 --> 03:06:49.180]  We have billions and billions of views on YouTube and Facebook, and we're dominating.
[03:06:49.480 --> 03:06:53.764]  But now they realize that it's intellectually superior to them, so they want to shut it off.
[03:06:54.024 --> 03:06:58.968]  Well, good luck, assholes, at Facebook and Twitter and Google and AdRoll.
[03:06:59.528 --> 03:07:00.970]  Too little, too late.
[03:07:01.070 --> 03:07:02.811]  It's already in your blood system.
[03:07:03.051 --> 03:07:05.433]  You're politically dead already.
[03:07:06.234 --> 03:07:10.818]  Let's just accelerate this as fast as we can so these assholes can't politically have their way with us anymore.
[03:07:12.059 --> 03:07:15.742]  Because once they shut you off politically, they're physically trying to shut you off, and that's not going to happen.
[03:07:16.282 --> 03:07:22.408]  Their system is coming down, and no amount of Islamists that they bring in, or any of it, is going to put it back together again.
[03:07:22.988 --> 03:07:23.649]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:07:23.669 --> 03:07:24.669]  This is the InfoWars.
[03:07:24.990 --> 03:07:26.651]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:07:26.891 --> 03:07:27.852]  They're trying to censor it.
[03:07:28.332 --> 03:07:29.754]  So spread that link everywhere.
[03:07:29.874 --> 03:07:35.919]  Nothing can stop human action, human intelligence, human will against their algorithms and computers.
[03:07:36.239 --> 03:07:37.600]  Let's smash them politically.
[03:07:40.102 --> 03:07:40.963]  Hey, it's Somalia.
[03:07:42.588 --> 03:07:43.328]  What's going on over there?
[03:07:43.348 --> 03:07:44.309]  Did Somalia make that?
[03:07:45.249 --> 03:07:45.650]  Look at that guy.
[03:07:45.670 --> 03:07:48.111]  It's probably like some local guy who owns a restaurant or something.
[03:07:48.131 --> 03:07:49.552]  Pulling in with his family on his boat.
[03:07:50.212 --> 03:07:50.572]  Look at that.
[03:07:50.612 --> 03:07:51.713]  That's Somalia built that.
[03:07:51.753 --> 03:07:52.613]  Why are we bitching?
[03:07:53.294 --> 03:07:54.334]  All cultures are the same.
[03:07:54.374 --> 03:07:55.875]  Hell, the Aztecs sacrificed their children.
[03:07:56.415 --> 03:07:57.676]  You know, the Nazis had their culture.
[03:07:57.696 --> 03:07:58.837]  You know, I thought all cultures were the same.
[03:07:58.857 --> 03:08:00.197]  No, the Soviets were corrupt, but it's okay.
[03:08:00.517 --> 03:08:01.278]  All cultures are the same.
[03:08:03.570 --> 03:08:06.073]  Not everybody knows Twitter and Facebook and all that's a bunch of garbage.
[03:08:06.413 --> 03:08:07.534]  We have to build our own systems.
[03:08:07.554 --> 03:08:08.676]  What's InfoWars.com?
[03:08:08.936 --> 03:08:09.977]  What's Prison Planet on TV?
[03:08:10.277 --> 03:08:15.163]  I get it, but let's use their systems now to wake as many people up as we can.
[03:08:29.884 --> 03:08:32.748]  And you were just watching Alex Jones out on a boat.
[03:08:33.329 --> 03:08:36.574]  And no matter where he is, he is out there defending your liberty.
[03:08:37.095 --> 03:08:40.520]  We here are in defense of your liberty 24-7.
[03:08:40.540 --> 03:08:44.345]  And of course, that is why we are in the crosshairs.
[03:08:44.886 --> 03:08:45.847]  And you know what?
[03:08:46.568 --> 03:08:47.448]  Shots fired!
[03:08:47.689 --> 03:08:55.632]  They have actually banned InfoWars from one of the largest online advertising platforms for its support of President Donald Trump.
[03:08:56.372 --> 03:09:02.355]  It's an unprecedented attack on this free speech and the liberty movement in its entirety.
[03:09:03.095 --> 03:09:05.016]  That's why we are doing this 13-hour broadcast.
[03:09:05.036 --> 03:09:10.920]  Thank you guys so much for sticking with us all these years and all of these hours today.
[03:09:10.940 --> 03:09:11.921]  13 hours.
[03:09:11.941 --> 03:09:12.661]  Yes, 13 hours.
[03:09:12.701 --> 03:09:14.963]  Go to the InfoWars store, support us there.
[03:09:15.363 --> 03:09:18.886]  We're having mega specials on everything, mainly store-wide.
[03:09:19.306 --> 03:09:21.547]  These are live at the InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:09:21.567 --> 03:09:27.091]  We got 25% off of Brain Force, Survival Shield, Supermail Vitality, Silver Bullet.
[03:09:27.511 --> 03:09:29.513]  The Caveman is 33% off.
[03:09:29.533 --> 03:09:32.255]  That's a really excellent product that Owen Schreuer is
[03:09:33.055 --> 03:09:33.976]  We're good to go.
[03:09:54.910 --> 03:10:00.414]  When the French citizens are about to have their election and they can come to Infowars.com and get the truth about what's happening.
[03:10:00.714 --> 03:10:08.519]  When Donald Trump talks about what happened in Sweden last night, the mainstream media and Colbert and all these others, they can go out and make fun.
[03:10:08.919 --> 03:10:11.241]  Oh, well let's see what happened in Sweden last night.
[03:10:11.621 --> 03:10:17.525]  You can come to Infowars.com and actually find out what happened in Sweden because we'll tell you what's going on.
[03:10:17.805 --> 03:10:21.787]  Meanwhile, those people in that country, they are stifled.
[03:10:22.068 --> 03:10:23.889]  Facebook there, they can get fined.
[03:10:24.449 --> 03:10:24.749]  I think so.
[03:10:43.644 --> 03:10:48.748]  But man, the shots have been fired and Google is basically saying that this is the end of free speech.
[03:10:49.188 --> 03:10:57.254]  President Obama, of course, signed quietly into law right before he left office the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act.
[03:10:57.334 --> 03:11:02.497]  They said it right there in the bill that they were going to put their disinfo out there.
[03:11:02.517 --> 03:11:11.364]  McBreen, you actually have the words from the ad roll to just kind of show you the audacity of the claims that they're making.
[03:11:11.755 --> 03:11:12.917]  Yeah, I want to read this to you.
[03:11:12.937 --> 03:11:26.173]  This is what was sent to our legal department, and this is from the ad role, who by the way has partnered with Facebook and Google to shut down what they consider to be either hate speech,
[03:11:27.054 --> 03:11:28.735]  Or fake news.
[03:11:29.015 --> 03:11:30.956]  If you guys could pull this up, I want to read this.
[03:11:31.016 --> 03:11:32.036]  This was sent to us.
[03:11:32.657 --> 03:11:40.160]  InfoWars has been flagged by the AdRoll policy team and as a result, campaigns suspended.
[03:11:40.760 --> 03:11:43.942]  All political content should focus on the merits of the candidate.
[03:11:44.902 --> 03:11:53.889]  And political messaging should not target special interests or groups or imply... Big Pharma, vaccines... Exactly, yeah, all Hillary's special interests.
[03:11:53.929 --> 03:11:54.109]  Illness.
[03:11:54.510 --> 03:11:55.771]  Or imply affiliations.
[03:11:56.251 --> 03:12:04.737]  Since your account was flagged, we are no longer able to run campaigns for your site and have now gone ahead and suspended the campaigns.
[03:12:05.098 --> 03:12:07.940]  Please consider this review final.
[03:12:08.360 --> 03:12:13.605]  So that was the reason for the suspension was because of our political content.
[03:12:14.006 --> 03:12:15.067]  Basically, this was a witch hunt.
[03:12:15.227 --> 03:12:16.288]  Can you believe that though?
[03:12:16.328 --> 03:12:28.380]  I mean, and this is why you have to understand that when the mainstream media comes after Donald Trump and says, he's attacking us, we're the First Amendment, we're free speech, we're for the people, we're not the enemy of the people.
[03:12:28.780 --> 03:12:37.611]  They are total propaganda channels and they have agreed to this type of... Their political content isn't going to come after any special interest groups.
[03:12:37.631 --> 03:12:40.034]  They're not going to come after Big Pharma or the vaccinations.
[03:12:40.295 --> 03:12:43.018]  That's why you're never going to hear the truth.
[03:12:43.299 --> 03:12:46.603]  Because they agree to stay silent about the things that really matter.
[03:12:46.823 --> 03:12:48.264]  And think about the term hate speech.
[03:12:48.524 --> 03:12:49.345]  Where did that come from?
[03:12:49.785 --> 03:12:51.586]  That came from the progressive left.
[03:12:51.726 --> 03:12:53.027]  They're the ones that invented that.
[03:12:53.307 --> 03:12:58.010]  How many times have we heard Donald Trump being accused of spreading hate speech?
[03:12:58.651 --> 03:13:00.672]  So that's pretty much their talking point.
[03:13:01.112 --> 03:13:03.614]  Now I also want to go to Breitbart, because remember, we're not alone.
[03:13:04.054 --> 03:13:07.116]  Breitbart, they've also been suspended from ad roll.
[03:13:08.277 --> 03:13:10.180]  And this is the letter they sent to Breitbart.
[03:13:10.580 --> 03:13:20.434]  We would like to clarify that AdRoll does not serve ads on Breitbart News because it violates our policies around offensive language and hate speech.
[03:13:24.239 --> 03:13:25.240]  That's insane.
[03:13:25.540 --> 03:13:29.241]  Breitbart, Infowars, we're all being targeted based on our beliefs.
[03:13:29.342 --> 03:13:31.102]  We're over the target and we're powerful.
[03:13:31.703 --> 03:13:33.323]  It's pretty disturbing.
[03:13:33.363 --> 03:13:44.849]  Could you imagine if the mainstream media was actually being shut down because, I mean, they've got Big Pharma, they've got so many different advertisements running on their channels
[03:13:45.069 --> 03:13:46.770]  Well what you're saying is key right there because keep in mind
[03:14:08.408 --> 03:14:11.110]  They're not banning us from our political content.
[03:14:11.170 --> 03:14:13.372]  Our political content is on our website.
[03:14:13.812 --> 03:14:16.955]  They are banning advertisements that have nothing to do with politics.
[03:14:17.315 --> 03:14:20.598]  You know, it's our products that are out there that have nothing to do with politics whatsoever.
[03:14:20.898 --> 03:14:27.343]  But since we are political and since we support hate speech and fake news and Donald Trump, that's why we're being banned.
[03:14:27.694 --> 03:14:47.377]  Wow and it's I mean and so this is what's really incredible is that right now you'll see a lot of people maybe in the mainstream media or the left and like yay InfoWars banned yeah good for you but it they're gonna come after you next I mean when the tides will turn when perhaps you wake up and you see
[03:14:47.737 --> 03:14:51.739]  That you might disagree with whatever political agenda is being pushed at the time.
[03:14:51.779 --> 03:14:53.460]  Maybe it'll be in five years from now.
[03:14:53.960 --> 03:14:58.763]  The winds of change could be upon us all and they will come after you next.
[03:14:59.103 --> 03:15:06.007]  If this is a precedent that's allowed to be set right now where you can set the standards of what is allowable speech.
[03:15:06.987 --> 03:15:08.789]  It's absolutely crazy.
[03:15:08.970 --> 03:15:20.103]  People bled, fought, died for that First Amendment and now we're just going to sit back and let Google and other tech giants decide what information people are allowed to access?
[03:15:20.737 --> 03:15:32.221]  This goes all the way back to traditional media, where we know that only six corporations control 90% of everything we watch on television, everything we read, everything we listen to on the radio.
[03:15:32.241 --> 03:15:36.663]  90% of those megacorporations own all of it.
[03:15:36.843 --> 03:15:38.604]  They even own the food we eat, frankly.
[03:15:38.724 --> 03:15:39.104]  Yeah.
[03:15:39.264 --> 03:15:40.004]  I'm going to name them.
[03:15:40.044 --> 03:15:43.906]  News Corporation, Disney, Time Warner, CBS, GE, and Viacom.
[03:15:44.046 --> 03:15:44.226]  Right?
[03:15:44.286 --> 03:15:44.726]  Own it all.
[03:15:45.006 --> 03:15:46.607]  But they don't control the internet.
[03:15:46.707 --> 03:15:48.328]  That's the beautiful thing about the internet.
[03:15:48.708 --> 03:15:52.089]  I think if it wasn't for the internet, I don't think Donald Trump would be president.
[03:15:52.129 --> 03:15:52.309]  No.
[03:15:52.509 --> 03:15:53.090]  Nope.
[03:15:53.130 --> 03:15:53.970]  Definitely not.
[03:15:54.170 --> 03:15:54.730]  And that's why.
[03:15:55.471 --> 03:15:57.771]  He's had to go directly to the people time and time again.
[03:15:57.791 --> 03:15:58.672]  That's why he's still
[03:15:59.824 --> 03:16:00.084]  I think
[03:16:20.329 --> 03:16:24.612]  I mean, people, even when everybody stood up and was like, no, no, no, we do not want this.
[03:16:24.992 --> 03:16:32.237]  It's like, they'll just keep on pushing in bills and legislation to try and do it until people are just bored of it and don't pay attention.
[03:16:32.277 --> 03:16:33.378]  And then that's when they get you.
[03:16:33.418 --> 03:16:34.939]  That's when, or they take you out.
[03:16:34.959 --> 03:16:46.867]  Yeah, they put out their media minions to totally lie to you and tell you how great it is that they're signing this bill and how wonderful it is that Obama decries the wild west of the internet.
[03:16:47.128 --> 03:16:49.069]  The internet's just the wild, wild west.
[03:16:49.189 --> 03:16:49.529]  They're panicking.
[03:16:49.549 --> 03:16:50.110]  They're panicking.
[03:16:50.390 --> 03:16:52.191]  And see, this is retribution.
[03:16:52.211 --> 03:16:53.651]  This is why they're coming after us.
[03:16:53.671 --> 03:16:54.432]  They're pissed off.
[03:16:54.872 --> 03:17:04.177]  Because look, you could arguably say that, or you can make the argument that if it wasn't for Alex Jones, if it wasn't for Infowars, Donald Trump wouldn't be president right now.
[03:17:04.197 --> 03:17:04.457]  I agree.
[03:17:04.477 --> 03:17:05.838]  Because we supported him.
[03:17:06.058 --> 03:17:09.120]  We're a big reason why he got elected to begin with.
[03:17:09.580 --> 03:17:10.801]  So I think this is payback.
[03:17:11.301 --> 03:17:14.523]  This is payback, and that's why they're coming after us.
[03:17:14.664 --> 03:17:18.726]  And, you know, I always said the revolution began on Inauguration Day.
[03:17:18.806 --> 03:17:20.327]  Everybody kind of was happy.
[03:17:20.588 --> 03:17:21.048]  We did it.
[03:17:21.088 --> 03:17:21.428]  We did it.
[03:17:21.468 --> 03:17:22.089]  They relaxed.
[03:17:22.169 --> 03:17:22.769]  No, no, no, no.
[03:17:22.789 --> 03:17:24.631]  The battle had just begun.
[03:17:24.971 --> 03:17:25.471]  Exactly.
[03:17:25.491 --> 03:17:30.455]  And there was so much important video footage that has come out during the election cycle.
[03:17:31.255 --> 03:17:46.881]  It's just, any person on the street could get a video footage of, for example, when Hillary Clinton fell, right, going into the van, and that completely blew up all over the internet, went viral, and then the mainstream media was forced to pick it up.
[03:17:47.081 --> 03:17:47.601]  And guess what?
[03:17:47.681 --> 03:17:49.882]  If they were able to censor the internet,
[03:17:50.382 --> 03:17:53.424]  The mainstream media wouldn't be forced to pick it up.
[03:17:53.444 --> 03:17:54.545]  Citizen journalism.
[03:17:54.625 --> 03:18:12.537]  And what's hilarious, it's funny, I just came across an old article on my desk where they actually were spinning her collapsing at the 9-11 memorial and saying what a feat of strength she had that she went all weekend and did these meetings and she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday.
[03:18:12.557 --> 03:18:13.758]  What a trooper.
[03:18:14.298 --> 03:18:15.359]  What a trooper!
[03:18:15.379 --> 03:18:16.580]  Just a feat of strength!
[03:18:16.600 --> 03:18:17.981]  That's how they spun it.
[03:18:18.041 --> 03:18:18.942]  So yes, you're right.
[03:18:19.002 --> 03:18:24.206]  If people weren't able to access the video themselves and just see it right there with their own eyes.
[03:18:24.526 --> 03:18:33.973]  But that's the thing that's so crazy is that the mainstream propaganda channels will show you the video and then tell you the exact opposite of what's happening.
[03:18:34.053 --> 03:18:37.196]  And you're looking at it with your eyes going, but she's collapsing!
[03:18:37.256 --> 03:18:38.597]  She's falling right on her face!
[03:18:38.677 --> 03:18:42.339]  And they're saying, look at the feat of strength this woman has!
[03:18:43.626 --> 03:18:44.490]  Oh my gosh!
[03:18:44.551 --> 03:18:45.957]  Total gaslighting!
[03:18:46.319 --> 03:18:47.686]  No wonder people are going insane!
[03:18:48.308 --> 03:18:54.610]  Well, the only way they can combat it is what they're doing now is they're trying to hit us where it hurts the most, our pocketbooks, right?
[03:18:55.010 --> 03:19:04.454]  If they can hurt our revenue, if they can destroy our revenue, they could potentially destroy us in the process or even destroy Donald Trump's chances of re-election in 2020.
[03:19:04.514 --> 03:19:05.954]  That's what this is all about.
[03:19:05.974 --> 03:19:12.917]  If there's no one that's going to put out there that there's a deep state coup trying to take out President Trump and
[03:19:14.077 --> 03:19:14.878]  I think so.
[03:19:42.619 --> 03:19:51.263]  The head of Newsweek, Bill Kristol, actually say, you know, I'm all for democracy, but I'd rather have a deep state than a President Trump.
[03:19:51.903 --> 03:19:53.944]  He actually said that out loud.
[03:19:54.104 --> 03:20:06.810]  Openly saying, I'd rather have these unelected, shadow government people who think that they are the unofficial, unelected, unaccountable government forever and ever and ever.
[03:20:08.467 --> 03:20:14.731]  Wow, I mean that is, it's just really frustrating to see and in the blatant, you know, disregard.
[03:20:14.751 --> 03:20:16.552]  I mean he just came right out and said it.
[03:20:16.873 --> 03:20:18.574]  They're just starting to get really loose.
[03:20:18.614 --> 03:20:28.020]  I mean they used to at least try to conceal that they were trying to stop us, that they were trying to shut us down, and that what their objective was and their plan was, but they're actually just kind of saying it now.
[03:20:28.200 --> 03:20:31.721]  And they're becoming more bold in what they're doing.
[03:20:31.861 --> 03:20:35.882]  And with Donald Trump, like you said, there is a coup happening.
[03:20:35.962 --> 03:20:39.383]  They do not want him to enact his policies.
[03:20:39.583 --> 03:20:48.925]  And we may have won, like she said, Leanne said this before, we may have won the battle, but the war, the war is about his policies.
[03:20:49.025 --> 03:20:57.447]  They don't want him saying no to TPP and following through because, you know, if somebody else were to come in, they could just undo it.
[03:20:58.007 --> 03:20:59.968]  They don't want the wall erected.
[03:20:59.988 --> 03:21:02.870]  They don't want his policies.
[03:21:03.290 --> 03:21:04.751]  That's what it's really all about.
[03:21:04.831 --> 03:21:08.333]  He's like getting these policies in there to stop what they're trying to do.
[03:21:08.393 --> 03:21:12.095]  He went in as the businessman that he is to get in there and make change.
[03:21:12.415 --> 03:21:21.120]  He was very vocal about, just in total disbelief at how clogged our government is and how it doesn't function.
[03:21:21.160 --> 03:21:23.021]  It doesn't work because it's so massive.
[03:21:23.061 --> 03:21:23.401]  It's so huge.
[03:21:23.501 --> 03:21:25.202]  And he's making good on all his campaign promises.
[03:21:25.442 --> 03:21:26.263]  It's amazing to see.
[03:21:27.043 --> 03:21:29.704]  And, you know, this ad roll, this is really a double standard by them.
[03:21:29.724 --> 03:21:32.605]  Because think about all the mainstream media websites that are out there.
[03:21:32.865 --> 03:21:34.185]  They have a political agenda.
[03:21:34.325 --> 03:21:36.506]  Their political agenda is to overthrow Donald Trump.
[03:21:36.686 --> 03:21:39.066]  But they haven't stopped their advertising revenue.
[03:21:39.086 --> 03:21:41.647]  I mean, it's a complete double standard.
[03:21:41.707 --> 03:21:41.887]  Right.
[03:21:42.067 --> 03:21:50.489]  And you think, how in the world do these failing outlets, I mean, they get like 4,000 views on their video, perhaps.
[03:21:50.529 --> 03:21:52.050]  I mean, where are their supporters?
[03:21:52.110 --> 03:21:52.890]  Where are their people?
[03:21:53.630 --> 03:21:55.671]  Who is watching these shows?
[03:21:55.971 --> 03:22:14.062]  But then you see that CNN, and that's why the new head there of CNN, levied that charge to Donald Trump, saying CNN's the only one that's seen in all the hospitals and all the airports and all these countries worldwide, so you better not
[03:22:14.702 --> 03:22:15.242]  Test us.
[03:22:15.262 --> 03:22:23.868]  You better not call us fake news because we could retaliate basically saying that we're going to cover you in a really biased way so you better not attack us.
[03:22:23.888 --> 03:22:28.892]  I mean, frankly, they've already been covering him in nothing but a biased way this entire time.
[03:22:28.952 --> 03:22:29.893]  So what's going to change?
[03:22:30.523 --> 03:22:37.009]  We've got Google changing algorithms to hide searches of InfoWars or whatever content they want.
[03:22:37.289 --> 03:22:39.632]  If they consider it hate speech, it goes to the bottom.
[03:22:40.232 --> 03:22:42.674]  And I just ran across this, because remember this?
[03:22:42.795 --> 03:22:44.957]  Mark Zuckerberg was caught on a hot mic.
[03:22:45.417 --> 03:22:46.778]  This was at a UN meeting.
[03:22:46.999 --> 03:22:48.360]  By the way, this is not InfoWars.
[03:22:48.620 --> 03:22:51.523]  CNBC, I think, reported on it.
[03:22:52.323 --> 03:22:55.885]  But they were talking about censoring anti-migrant posts.
[03:22:56.226 --> 03:23:09.313]  So it was Angela Merkel talking to Zuckerberg, and she says, wow, we're getting this tidal wave of Syrian refugees into Germany, and a lot of people don't like it, and there's a lot of negative comments on Facebook.
[03:23:09.713 --> 03:23:10.634]  What can we do about it?
[03:23:10.794 --> 03:23:11.654]  Are you working on this?
[03:23:11.694 --> 03:23:12.915]  Are you doing something about it?
[03:23:13.035 --> 03:23:15.677]  And Zuckerberg says, yes, yes, we're doing something about it.
[03:23:15.697 --> 03:23:16.357]  We need to do some work.
[03:23:16.377 --> 03:23:16.437]  Bam!
[03:23:16.557 --> 03:23:17.698]  On the hot mic, cut!
[03:23:18.058 --> 03:23:19.939]  You know, so we know they're doing this.
[03:23:20.039 --> 03:23:20.640]  It's happening.
[03:23:20.940 --> 03:23:23.582]  This isn't a conspiracy theory.
[03:23:23.622 --> 03:23:32.008]  Yes, and I've even heard about some people already starting to be banned on Twitter for saying things against Muslims, and they're getting 12-hour bans.
[03:23:32.088 --> 03:23:41.034]  So it's just, it's like they're policing and punishing people for their thoughts, for their thoughts and for their speech, like they're our parents, like Big Brother.
[03:23:41.334 --> 03:23:46.819]  Yes, or all the negative comments about Trump on Twitter go to the top and all the positive ones go to the bottom.
[03:23:46.899 --> 03:23:47.519]  If they're even there at all.
[03:23:47.539 --> 03:23:52.023]  So we have a person who's got that herd mentality and they're reading and they're like, wow, everybody must really hate him like I do, you know?
[03:23:52.043 --> 03:23:52.283]  Yeah.
[03:23:52.403 --> 03:23:54.045]  So it's exactly what they're doing.
[03:23:54.225 --> 03:23:54.745]  Yeah, and that's it.
[03:23:54.806 --> 03:24:00.971]  And like Millie has pointed out, it would be too obvious if they just took InfoWars off the air or got rid of CBAN or...
[03:24:02.632 --> 03:24:04.774]  An assassination attempt, for instance.
[03:24:04.814 --> 03:24:06.095]  That would just be too obvious.
[03:24:06.415 --> 03:24:08.737]  So they've got to knock out the different avenues.
[03:24:10.118 --> 03:24:12.100]  You were saying, like, if they were to take out Trump, where would they go?
[03:24:12.140 --> 03:24:22.027]  They've got to have the cart before the horse, basically, is what we're getting at, is how, you know, we're seeing all these things unravel, and it just seems so strategic, what they're doing.
[03:24:22.808 --> 03:24:27.812]  It's like they have a plan, because we're seeing, you know, they took out Flynn, and what's Flynn's job?
[03:24:28.232 --> 03:24:35.096]  You know, Flynn is going to be overseeing the CIA and the intelligence communities.
[03:24:35.116 --> 03:24:44.582]  We've seen in the past how the intelligence communities may have actually orchestrated assassinations on somebody like Kennedy and other people in the past.
[03:24:45.623 --> 03:24:46.243]  We're good to go.
[03:25:00.908 --> 03:25:02.609]  Yeah, Trump should have stuck up for him.
[03:25:02.629 --> 03:25:09.635]  Yeah, exactly, but we're seeing now Flynn's gone, so he has to have somebody replace and fill that spot, and nobody's in that spot yet.
[03:25:09.695 --> 03:25:11.896]  Right, so there's no one overseeing him, just like Hillary.
[03:25:12.377 --> 03:25:14.919]  And there was no one overseeing Hillary Clinton's State Department.
[03:25:14.939 --> 03:25:21.043]  They don't want someone that's actually going to be in support of Trump's agenda overseeing them and their dealing.
[03:25:21.083 --> 03:25:26.368]  Yeah, so he's got a big fight internally too, so it's actually a civil war within the intelligence community as well.
[03:25:27.088 --> 03:25:32.916]  You know, we talk a lot of smack about the intelligence communities, and rightfully so, but we do know there are a lot of good patriots.
[03:25:33.036 --> 03:25:33.456]  A lot of them.
[03:25:33.516 --> 03:25:34.638]  Usually not at the top, though.
[03:25:34.658 --> 03:25:35.359]  That's the problem.
[03:25:35.379 --> 03:25:41.306]  There's a lot of patriots within the intelligence communities who are instrumental in leaking out information.
[03:25:41.326 --> 03:25:41.847]  Absolutely.
[03:25:42.708 --> 03:25:51.511]  And that's what Steve Pocenek was saying on the show today, and that there were so many of them within these communities who support Alex Jones, who support Donald Trump, and that do understand what's going on.
[03:25:51.531 --> 03:26:03.355]  It would just be so interesting to see what those people within these organizations actually witnessing this coup going on, just sort of saying, wow, this is bad, I've got to do something.
[03:26:03.775 --> 03:26:10.598]  Just like in Captain America, you know, they all kind of woke up to what was going on, even though they were being given orders and you're not supposed to question your higher-ups.
[03:26:11.198 --> 03:26:21.687]  You know, what they're up to, but it is typically the people within the organizations that are able to take these corporations or the evil corporations or whatever down.
[03:26:21.867 --> 03:26:28.852]  Just like James O'Keefe is set to release some hundred plus hours of footage from within the mainstream media.
[03:26:28.872 --> 03:26:30.574]  That is so exciting!
[03:26:30.674 --> 03:26:38.500]  I seriously cannot wait to see the video footage that O'Keefe is holding because, man, will you just release it already, James?
[03:26:38.580 --> 03:26:39.001]  And guarantee!
[03:26:39.021 --> 03:26:40.302]  It sounds so exciting!
[03:26:40.762 --> 03:26:46.950]  I guarantee the media is going to cover it in such a biased way, say it was deceptively edited, say that it's not real.
[03:26:46.970 --> 03:26:54.378]  But when you play that stuff unedited for a long time, you know, and that's the thing, is that's what independent media outlets, they're going to play everything in its entirety.
[03:26:54.419 --> 03:26:56.061]  So, look, people are going to learn the truth.
[03:26:56.401 --> 03:27:00.486]  That's why they're trying to, that's why they want it to be considered hate speech so you'll never see it.
[03:27:00.646 --> 03:27:02.988]  That's why they want to flag your videos on YouTube.
[03:27:03.348 --> 03:27:14.697]  Apparently, it wasn't like Project Veritas, because usually a lot of times they have someone of their own, they get them in, and then they get them to get the footage, get the information.
[03:27:15.098 --> 03:27:24.385]  In this case, it seems as though James O'Keefe hinted at the fact that it's actually a mole from the inside, that actually somebody that was working there that then came
[03:27:25.306 --> 03:27:34.957]  It's gonna make it even more interesting because it reminds me of the DNC leaks and how many people believe that that was actually in fact somebody from the inside that leaked.
[03:27:35.157 --> 03:27:39.922]  That was upset about the way that they burned Bernie Sanders and wanted that information to get out there.
[03:27:40.983 --> 03:27:45.608]  Many mysteries still surrounds all of that of course but yeah I mean this is
[03:27:47.199 --> 03:28:09.753]  You know I just remember all of us here just during the election season especially when Hillary Clinton called out Alex Jones by name called him the dark heart Alex Jones and we were all just kind of a little bit I know I was super nervous and I had the feeling that she was gonna win and she was going to take us out like we would be top priority to take out.
[03:28:09.813 --> 03:28:11.234]  And we should also be watching
[03:28:11.994 --> 03:28:12.394]  To see.
[03:28:12.474 --> 03:28:15.775]  I mean, we should watch carefully because this seems to be the pattern.
[03:28:15.855 --> 03:28:22.497]  Somebody comes out, a mole or whatever, they leak something and then a couple days later, a week later, the person mysteriously dies.
[03:28:22.937 --> 03:28:24.298]  So we should just be watching for that.
[03:28:24.318 --> 03:28:25.018]  As a heart attack.
[03:28:25.198 --> 03:28:25.978]  Young and healthy.
[03:28:26.218 --> 03:28:28.939]  Speaking of which, the Clinton body count.
[03:28:29.679 --> 03:28:40.505]  Remember then, Google was caught censoring negative information about Hillary, but they actually, in the search algorithms, they prevented the searches for the Clinton body count that was during the campaign.
[03:28:40.545 --> 03:28:43.227]  Clinton body count, whenever you would search it.
[03:28:43.407 --> 03:28:51.352]  But you could go to Bing or Yahoo, other search engines that, you know, people don't necessarily, they use Google.
[03:28:51.672 --> 03:28:54.974]  It's kind of like, Google it, it's a verb, it's become a verb, just Google it.
[03:28:55.314 --> 03:28:58.236]  So they know that they're the main search engine, they're the main
[03:28:58.976 --> 03:29:01.440]  Collater there with the algorithm, so it's pretty impressive.
[03:29:01.801 --> 03:29:03.363]  What would it change it to?
[03:29:03.463 --> 03:29:08.892]  Clinton... Clinton benevolent, beautiful things that she does.
[03:29:09.012 --> 03:29:10.695]  Yeah, when you type in Hillary Clinton.
[03:29:11.997 --> 03:29:14.759]  I mean it was just like really blatant stuff that they would.
[03:29:14.779 --> 03:29:16.341]  It was all positive.
[03:29:16.401 --> 03:29:17.862]  Oh yeah.
[03:29:18.202 --> 03:29:23.927]  If you put in Clinton body, it would just return suggestions related to auto repair shops.
[03:29:24.307 --> 03:29:26.008]  Nothing to do with Hillary Clinton.
[03:29:26.048 --> 03:29:29.431]  And compare that to the other search engines who all put up Clinton body count.
[03:29:29.571 --> 03:29:31.253]  Yeah, it's all Clinton Body Shop.
[03:29:31.733 --> 03:29:31.833]  Ugh.
[03:29:31.954 --> 03:29:32.434]  Oh wow, yeah.
[03:29:32.454 --> 03:29:35.297]  It's like, no, the Clinton Body Count.
[03:29:35.497 --> 03:29:42.024]  Oh my gosh, and then you see up at Yahoo, at least Yahoo's being a little bit more honest here, saying Body Count.
[03:29:42.084 --> 03:29:44.206]  It was the same thing with Hillary Clinton's health.
[03:29:44.687 --> 03:29:48.911]  Whenever you would put in Clinton Health or something, it would change the search to
[03:29:50.032 --> 03:30:07.794]  Some something that would just glow about her and make it would finish the sentence for you and it was just all positive Clinton global health initiative or something like that where we just I mean and that's what they want to do is they want to be able to control the information and even if you know what you're looking for
[03:30:08.695 --> 03:30:08.935]  Absolutely.
[03:30:30.223 --> 03:30:36.070]  Sure, AI, it's super smart and how convenient it would be to just not even have to think about anything, it would just work for me.
[03:30:36.430 --> 03:30:43.038]  But you see how the controllers will be controlling the AI and that's a perfect example of how they're going to use it.
[03:30:43.058 --> 03:30:44.980]  Who controls the past, controls the future.
[03:30:45.140 --> 03:30:47.222]  Who controls the future, controls the past.
[03:30:47.303 --> 03:30:48.224]  It's a quote from 1984.
[03:30:49.665 --> 03:30:56.487]  And, you know, we're talking about the megacorporations that control everything on television and on radio and in print.
[03:30:56.847 --> 03:30:58.268]  These are the same megacorporations.
[03:30:58.288 --> 03:31:01.629]  They lost control, like we said, of the information that's getting out there.
[03:31:01.649 --> 03:31:03.330]  So they want to control the internet.
[03:31:03.390 --> 03:31:04.490]  That's what they're trying to do.
[03:31:04.810 --> 03:31:05.850]  They want to consolidate it.
[03:31:05.890 --> 03:31:07.351]  They want to monopolize the internet.
[03:31:07.831 --> 03:31:08.911]  That's what they're trying to do.
[03:31:08.971 --> 03:31:15.193]  That's why they're going after us, and that's why they're restricting us from advertising.
[03:31:15.213 --> 03:31:16.593]  That's why they're going after Breitbart.
[03:31:16.793 --> 03:31:18.974]  This is very, very dangerous.
[03:31:19.014 --> 03:31:23.855]  We do not want to lose control of the internet, or else it's going to be back to phase one.
[03:31:23.875 --> 03:31:27.876]  We're going to be back to the mainstream media controlling everything once again.
[03:31:28.156 --> 03:31:28.916]  We can't allow it!
[03:31:29.116 --> 03:31:32.779]  No, and we will not allow it, and that is why we have sounded the alarm.
[03:31:32.859 --> 03:31:38.302]  We're doing this 13-hour broadcast at the last minute to let you guys know that we are under attack.
[03:31:38.903 --> 03:31:44.847]  We have been at the forefront getting President Trump in office, and the globalists are pissed about that.
[03:31:44.907 --> 03:31:54.474]  We are too powerful, too effective, and they don't want our reach to extend into these other elections that are about to happen in France and Germany.
[03:31:54.494 --> 03:31:55.054]  1776 worldwide.
[03:31:55.114 --> 03:31:56.515]  Worldwide, baby.
[03:31:56.555 --> 03:31:58.736]  They see what happened with Brexit and they're afraid.
[03:31:59.016 --> 03:32:03.158]  They're seeing that the globalist mission, the globalist agenda is not working.
[03:32:03.218 --> 03:32:05.059]  It's failing and it will fail.
[03:32:05.259 --> 03:32:05.959]  It will fail.
[03:32:05.999 --> 03:32:10.041]  But this is their last ditch effort to try and cut off one of our supply channels.
[03:32:10.402 --> 03:32:17.205]  We've been banned from one of the largest online advertising platforms for our support of President Donald J. Trump.
[03:32:17.665 --> 03:32:19.046]  This is unprecedented.
[03:32:19.366 --> 03:32:21.387]  We can't even believe this, frankly.
[03:32:21.467 --> 03:32:24.989]  I know Alex has been kind of fuming around the office the last couple days.
[03:32:25.529 --> 03:32:29.010]  With this shot that's been fired, but we need your support now more than ever.
[03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:32.911]  You guys know that we are totally a listener supported here.
[03:32:32.931 --> 03:32:39.453]  We always have been, and it's our excellent InfoWars Life products that have really helped launch us to the next level.
[03:32:39.874 --> 03:32:44.755]  Build a second studio here, hire Millie Weaver, bring her on board and other reporters.
[03:32:45.755 --> 03:32:49.777]  So we need to continue to be able to bring in revenue.
[03:32:49.877 --> 03:32:53.638]  Alex Jones isn't the kind of guy who's out there, you know, buying a
[03:32:54.718 --> 03:32:59.382]  50 foot yacht and six cars and you know he's just a regular guy.
[03:32:59.402 --> 03:33:01.704]  He's got a Dodge Charger.
[03:33:02.004 --> 03:33:11.432]  Celebrities that want to tell everyone that they need to you know that we need to bring in all these refugees yet they've got these 16, 20 bedroom mansions.
[03:33:11.972 --> 03:33:17.733]  Alex Jones is not lecturing you about taking in refugees from one of his ten empty mansions.
[03:33:17.773 --> 03:33:18.413]  Exactly!
[03:33:18.493 --> 03:33:19.293]  And that's the point.
[03:33:20.013 --> 03:33:24.574]  You see him out there where he's out on the lake with his friends and he gets it.
[03:33:25.554 --> 03:33:30.635]  The blood of liberty is just pumping through his veins and he wants to get this information out to people.
[03:33:30.675 --> 03:33:31.496]  He doesn't stop.
[03:33:31.516 --> 03:33:33.276]  The future of the world depends on it.
[03:33:33.316 --> 03:33:35.756]  Our grandchildren, our children, America.
[03:33:35.816 --> 03:33:36.817]  It's so important!
[03:33:36.837 --> 03:33:38.457]  The future of America depends on it.
[03:33:38.477 --> 03:33:39.457]  So we've got to start fighting.
[03:33:39.617 --> 03:33:40.597]  Absolutely, man.
[03:33:40.637 --> 03:33:50.182]  We are alive right now for this very purpose, and that's why this attack is just crazy, unprecedented, and we need your support right now.
[03:33:50.302 --> 03:33:51.802]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:33:52.123 --> 03:33:53.683]  We are running some mega specials.

[03:34:06.969 --> 03:34:13.155]  If you guys could pull up the caveman to just kind of show people the really incredible ingredients that are within this product.
[03:34:13.175 --> 03:34:15.237]  I know Owen Schroyer... By the way, that stuff tastes really, really good.
[03:34:15.257 --> 03:34:18.440]  Yeah, I know Jones has been making a shake every day.
[03:34:18.580 --> 03:34:23.104]  Owen Schroyer is eyeballing the one that's on my desk because I haven't decided if I'm going to take it or not.
[03:34:23.144 --> 03:34:24.185]  It tastes like chocolate.
[03:34:24.886 --> 03:34:26.407]  It's like a chocolate shake.
[03:34:26.427 --> 03:34:26.968]  It's really good.
[03:34:27.228 --> 03:34:35.433]  It's got really high quality ingredients within it and you're just not going to find as good of products that are out there.
[03:34:35.493 --> 03:34:40.957]  We've got bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berries.
[03:34:41.657 --> 03:34:43.358]  This is all incredible stuff.
[03:34:43.839 --> 03:34:48.562]  It's got the stevia leaf extract as well to just give it that little bit of natural sweetness.
[03:34:49.162 --> 03:34:51.763]  But we are not beholden to the globalists.
[03:34:51.783 --> 03:34:53.264]  We're not beholden to the megabanks.
[03:34:53.284 --> 03:34:54.865]  We're not beholden to Big Pharma.
[03:34:54.885 --> 03:35:03.269]  That's why we're able to fight against them and fight against their agenda and speak the truth about what they're up to because they're not funding us.
[03:35:03.589 --> 03:35:04.549]  And they hate that.
[03:35:04.589 --> 03:35:16.235]  And they hate the fact that our information has been able to go worldwide because of people like you who care about this country, care about this world, care about liberty and are willing to fight for that sovereignty.
[03:35:16.815 --> 03:35:18.496]  We are not establishment funded.
[03:35:18.576 --> 03:35:23.839]  We are solely supported by listeners, people, you out there.
[03:35:23.919 --> 03:35:25.680]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:35:26.020 --> 03:35:27.881]  Take advantage of these mega specials.

[03:35:34.985 --> 03:35:40.288]  And who knows, Alex might put them a little bit further than this 13 hours, but you never know.
[03:35:40.368 --> 03:35:43.030]  He might cut it off as well if we are pretty successful here.
[03:35:44.050 --> 03:35:48.372]  So go ahead, supercharge your state of mind with Brain Force, 25% off right now!
[03:35:48.833 --> 03:35:50.694]  Also, you never know who will answer the telephone.
[03:35:50.954 --> 03:35:56.296]  Because we have a lot of people, I know Owen Schroyer spending time over there answering phone calls.
[03:35:56.316 --> 03:35:58.077]  I'm going to be answering phone calls later.
[03:35:58.157 --> 03:36:01.659]  So you might talk to one of us, we might answer the phone when you're placing an order.
[03:36:02.239 --> 03:36:03.220]  Maybe, maybe.
[03:36:03.300 --> 03:36:11.864]  And just make sure you share this link for our live 13-hour Defend Liberty broadcast because the word needs to get out.
[03:36:12.344 --> 03:36:22.452]  That we need to defend liberty and defend our freedoms on the internet, keep free speech alive, and help defend InfoWars so that we can defend you.
[03:36:22.472 --> 03:36:26.155]  McBreen, you've been here for quite some time.
[03:36:26.175 --> 03:36:27.877]  Six years.
[03:36:28.117 --> 03:36:39.048]  You've been here for quite some time, and so you've actually seen a lot of the conspiracy theories that Alex Jones and InfoWars have talked about, the information people have tried to put out there.
[03:36:39.468 --> 03:36:43.212]  What are your favorite conspiracy theories that turned out to be true?
[03:36:45.663 --> 03:36:46.384]  Turned out to be true.
[03:36:46.464 --> 03:36:53.830]  I just like to say that we, Infowars, Alex Jones, this network, we talk about things that you will never hear on the mainstream media.
[03:36:54.230 --> 03:36:57.633]  NSA, surveillance, they're going to spy on you through your washing machine.
[03:36:57.733 --> 03:36:59.334]  How about the 28 pages?
[03:36:59.514 --> 03:37:03.598]  We talked about the redacted pages in the 9-11 report for years and years.
[03:37:03.958 --> 03:37:08.802]  They're finally not redacted, they're unredacted, mostly, there's still a little bit in there.
[03:37:09.142 --> 03:37:09.402]  Yeah.
[03:37:25.376 --> 03:37:29.057]  Proof without a doubt that the government of Saudi Arabia was complicit.
[03:37:29.077 --> 03:37:34.479]  They were in on it as far as training and financing the 9-11 hijackers, which is an act of war.
[03:37:34.499 --> 03:37:46.963]  And these are high-level government officials who were working with our government here in the United States, helping them, training these people here in Sarasota, Florida, where I am from, you know, which is unbelievable to me.
[03:37:47.623 --> 03:37:59.573]  And that's where you get the like... And it just so happens that George W. Bush was reading a book to the school kids in the place where the hijackers were from, were getting their training.
[03:37:59.613 --> 03:38:01.054]  Like, come on!
[03:38:01.134 --> 03:38:09.221]  Okay, so I'm gonna get... Obviously, that was one of my conspiracy theories that Alex Jones talked about how they were gonna be doing something like that and blaming it on
[03:38:11.400 --> 03:38:12.260]  Osama Bin Laden.
[03:38:12.380 --> 03:38:14.761]  He said it months before that happened.
[03:38:14.981 --> 03:38:17.161]  Or blaming it on Saddam Hussein.
[03:38:17.301 --> 03:38:27.424]  My favorite conspiracy theory that came through, I guess you can call it a conspiracy theory, was when we were all pointing out that Hillary was really sick and had awful health.
[03:38:27.484 --> 03:38:28.424]  Because guess what?
[03:38:28.464 --> 03:38:31.425]  Lo and behold, I was there and I got the footage.
[03:38:31.685 --> 03:38:35.466]  I was watching her literally coughing and hacking on stage.
[03:38:35.886 --> 03:38:37.526]  Almost like coughing up her lung.
[03:38:37.546 --> 03:38:39.627]  Oh that's right, you got the green goblet!
[03:38:40.568 --> 03:38:41.790]  Oh my gosh.
[03:38:42.851 --> 03:38:55.045]  Leaving the scene following in her motorcade and literally I mean you could tell something was wrong because she was she was already over an hour late to come out and give her speech people are sitting around in the blistering heat like
[03:38:55.586 --> 03:38:56.686]  You know, waiting and waiting.
[03:38:56.726 --> 03:38:57.267]  Well, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:38:57.527 --> 03:39:04.489]  Remember, also, too, you were there, and so the mainstream media wasn't, they were just like, oh, her rally and all the people that were in attendance.
[03:39:04.589 --> 03:39:05.149]  Yeah, everything was normal.
[03:39:05.169 --> 03:39:06.450]  It wasn't even her rally.
[03:39:06.490 --> 03:39:09.611]  She hijacked, like, a Fourth of July picnic or something.
[03:39:09.631 --> 03:39:10.651]  That's right.
[03:39:10.731 --> 03:39:13.892]  It was so hard for her to get a crowd, she would have to hijack other events.
[03:39:14.312 --> 03:39:17.236]  It's spot on, Leigh-Anne, because that's exactly what happened.
[03:39:17.276 --> 03:39:25.826]  The mainstream media made it look like that it was Hillary's rally and that all these people came out to see Hillary Clinton speak, and it was not the case.
[03:39:26.207 --> 03:39:30.452]  This was an annual Labor Day festival in a predominantly
[03:39:30.452 --> 03:39:30.652]  Absolutely.
[03:39:30.812 --> 03:39:32.212]  African-American community.
[03:39:32.292 --> 03:39:37.133]  And they held a Labor Day Festival every single year at that exact same park.
[03:39:37.593 --> 03:39:45.175]  And actually, when I talked to some of the patrons that go every year, they said that the attendance was actually way lower than usual.
[03:39:45.315 --> 03:39:47.175]  And that they didn't even know Clinton was coming.
[03:39:47.355 --> 03:39:48.595]  Hillary Clinton being there.
[03:39:48.615 --> 03:39:50.716]  So it was just ridiculous.
[03:39:50.736 --> 03:39:54.196]  But she had to hijack it because her numbers were horrible.
[03:39:54.496 --> 03:39:56.416]  And Donald Trump was like a rock star.
[03:39:56.497 --> 03:39:58.957]  Any town USA, thousands of people were there.
[03:39:59.497 --> 03:40:02.939]  And then remember they would try to say, the crowd size doesn't matter.
[03:40:02.979 --> 03:40:04.560]  That's not, you know.
[03:40:04.580 --> 03:40:06.921]  Oh yeah, crowd size matters.
[03:40:06.961 --> 03:40:10.422]  Yeah, except for the fact that, oh, here's a great one.
[03:40:10.442 --> 03:40:20.828]  Okay, you know, the mainstream media always trying to put all these pictures that are completely doctored, making Hillary look like she had a bigger crowd than she actually had.
[03:40:20.888 --> 03:40:22.769]  I mean, literally at one of these, at one of her
[03:40:23.869 --> 03:40:24.510]  We're good to go.
[03:40:46.553 --> 03:40:47.014]  We're good.
[03:41:06.216 --> 03:41:15.539]  They're trying to control the optics, just like they tried to control the optics and say Donald Trump's crowd was really small at the inauguration, meanwhile they didn't give you the actual time of day that the picture itself was taken.
[03:41:15.559 --> 03:41:20.140]  If you want to check out that video footage, it's on the Millennial Millie YouTube channel.
[03:41:20.180 --> 03:41:22.540]  It's under Hillary's Carnival Circus.
[03:41:22.721 --> 03:41:24.681]  Go ahead and YouTube it.
[03:41:25.041 --> 03:41:27.722]  It is hilarious and you can check out some of that footage.
[03:41:28.482 --> 03:41:28.962]  I think so.
[03:41:49.571 --> 03:41:56.235]  What the heck does the EPA need all of these bullets and guns and protective vests and everything?
[03:41:56.255 --> 03:42:07.041]  It was freaking people out, rightly so, and it forced the mainstream media to have to cover it and lo and behold, sure it was true, but of course they didn't think anything of it because President Obama was in charge at the time.
[03:42:07.381 --> 03:42:23.507]  So this is the kind of information that InfoWars.com has forced out into the mainstream media, or we're the only ones covering it decades ahead of time, with Alex has been telling people for a long time about the Internet of Things and how they're going to be spying on you.
[03:42:23.827 --> 03:42:25.288]  And that's why they want to shut us down.
[03:42:25.348 --> 03:42:30.110]  That's why they want to cut our advertising and take out that supply channel with the ad roll.
[03:42:30.430 --> 03:42:31.030]  Here's another one.
[03:42:31.370 --> 03:42:34.691]  This is one that they definitely do not talk about in the mainstream media.
[03:42:34.731 --> 03:42:37.151]  That is Project Mockingbird.
[03:42:37.171 --> 03:42:37.731]  Okay?
[03:42:38.071 --> 03:42:38.932]  Now this goes back.
[03:42:38.952 --> 03:42:43.772]  This is a CIA operation that started at the very beginning of the CIA.
[03:42:44.193 --> 03:42:46.813]  And it's embedded reporters in media.
[03:42:46.873 --> 03:42:52.854]  And they had thousands of people within, you know, news wires and wire services and news agencies.
[03:42:53.294 --> 03:42:57.615]  Thousands of people within like the New York Times, the Washington Post, Newsweek.
[03:42:58.095 --> 03:43:01.156]  So they're embedded, and the thing about this, this was in the 50s, okay?
[03:43:01.916 --> 03:43:05.417]  And do you think they just suddenly stopped now in 2017?
[03:43:05.737 --> 03:43:06.517]  Of course not.
[03:43:06.737 --> 03:43:08.698]  They're heavily embedded in media.
[03:43:09.418 --> 03:43:13.459]  Nowadays, half the anchors you see are probably CIA.
[03:43:13.539 --> 03:43:16.860]  And you can bet your ass that they're trying to do the same thing with the internet.
[03:43:17.040 --> 03:43:18.880]  So that's why they want control.
[03:43:18.940 --> 03:43:21.861]  So there's another one that you'll only hear on InfoWars.
[03:43:22.961 --> 03:43:26.883]  And they just try to throw us under the bus and say that we're just these conspiracy theorists.
[03:43:26.943 --> 03:43:31.325]  I know there was an article from Paul Joseph Watson from like 2007, I think.
[03:43:31.385 --> 03:43:34.767]  It's so, it's on like our old, old site.
[03:43:34.827 --> 03:43:41.130]  You can't even really find it anymore unless you can search specifically, but he's talking about how they're going to create these
[03:43:42.371 --> 03:43:42.891]  Drones!
[03:43:43.091 --> 03:43:44.512]  Tiny, tiny drones.
[03:43:45.033 --> 03:43:52.699]  Insect drones and how they're developing these little spy devices or drones that the army could use.
[03:43:52.839 --> 03:44:01.827]  And now, lo and behold, what is it, 11 years later, they're talking about these little surveillance insects and the spy drones and the butterfly drones.
[03:44:02.087 --> 03:44:06.030]  Here, Harvard professor, government mosquito drones are going to extract your DNA.
[03:44:06.090 --> 03:44:06.451]  I mean,
[03:44:08.132 --> 03:44:23.319]  This is the information that we've been bringing to you for a long time and that is why they are so afraid of us because they cannot believe that A. we would dare talk about it, but B. it goes so viral and it goes worldwide.
[03:44:23.359 --> 03:44:28.102]  I mean I can't even tell you how many people I've got all over the world that say thank you.
[03:44:28.182 --> 03:44:34.425]  If you have family and friends who think, oh come on man, those guys are conspiracy theorists, you shouldn't listen to InfoWars.
[03:44:35.285 --> 03:44:38.386]  If you plant the seeds, eventually they'll come around.
[03:44:38.426 --> 03:44:41.827]  I mean, even Tucker Carlson, remember what he used to think of Alex Jones?
[03:44:41.847 --> 03:44:43.128]  He's like, F Alex Jones.
[03:44:43.148 --> 03:44:44.248]  You know, he said that on camera.
[03:44:44.528 --> 03:44:46.729]  And then once he said, Alex, I used to think you were crazy.
[03:44:46.769 --> 03:44:48.390]  Geraldo even told him that.
[03:44:48.810 --> 03:44:50.971]  And Joe Rogan used to say the same thing.
[03:44:50.991 --> 03:44:52.471]  Thought you were crazy, man.
[03:44:52.491 --> 03:44:57.073]  But, you know, as time went on, a lot of the stuff you're saying turned out to come true.
[03:44:57.313 --> 03:44:59.254]  And all it takes is just do some investigating.
[03:44:59.334 --> 03:45:01.715]  Turn off your damn television and just
[03:45:02.458 --> 03:45:30.487]  That's one thing I will say, if they do manage to take InvoWars down, turn off your freaking television set, because that is like one of the main things that they use to control us, control our thoughts, control the frequency that gets put out in the room, even with the Wi-Fi, everything, that frequency, even the flicker of the screen is set at a certain rate to make you docile, it puts you in a trance, it dumbs you down, that's why you can
[03:45:31.207 --> 03:45:31.528]  I don't
[03:45:47.728 --> 03:45:49.089]  Shouldn't even be watching them anyway.
[03:45:49.149 --> 03:45:51.870]  Let us do that for you and we'll tell you what they're saying.
[03:45:52.491 --> 03:46:01.356]  Especially if you have children because the children's TV shows are absolutely packed with subliminal programs.
[03:46:01.396 --> 03:46:03.077]  It's unbelievable.
[03:46:03.477 --> 03:46:07.659]  You don't even realize your child is being fully programmed to be an SKW.
[03:46:09.101 --> 03:46:17.691]  You know, next thing you know, you're going to look back and your child's going to be a teenager about to go to college and they're fully looking like Rainbow Dash.
[03:46:17.731 --> 03:46:23.377]  You're going to be looking like a social justice warrior.
[03:46:23.397 --> 03:46:27.762]  And how cool it is to protest because what's that singer's name?
[03:46:29.304 --> 03:46:30.925]  The one that kissed a girl and liked it.
[03:46:31.185 --> 03:46:31.926]  Katy Perry!
[03:46:31.946 --> 03:46:32.506]  Katy Perry!
[03:46:32.526 --> 03:46:34.587]  She's like, oh, yay, let's protest.
[03:46:34.647 --> 03:46:36.268]  It's time to resist Donald Trump.
[03:46:36.548 --> 03:46:42.932]  And so this is what your kids are getting indoctrinated with because they think that Katy Perry or those Disney stars are the best.
[03:46:43.312 --> 03:46:45.293]  They have them as pied pipers.
[03:46:45.673 --> 03:46:49.375]  So, for example, you had Miley Cyrus as Hannah Montana.
[03:46:49.435 --> 03:46:53.418]  All these parents are like, oh, you know, it's a cute little Disney Channel show.
[03:46:53.478 --> 03:46:55.019]  It's really sweet and innocent.
[03:46:55.059 --> 03:46:55.919]  You know, Miley Cyrus.
[03:46:55.959 --> 03:46:57.260]  Here, get addicted to this daughter.
[03:46:57.800 --> 03:46:58.561]  I think so.
[03:47:16.670 --> 03:47:22.656]  And the next thing you know, she's dancing up on a stripper pole, and she's shaving her hair off, she's dyeing her armpit hair green.
[03:47:23.017 --> 03:47:29.383]  She's completely, you know, this ultra-feminist, and she's like this massive Hillary Clinton supporter.
[03:47:29.523 --> 03:47:30.604]  And it's not by accident.
[03:47:30.624 --> 03:47:32.286]  I think it's all by design.
[03:47:32.666 --> 03:47:34.767]  Yeah, it is 100% by design.
[03:47:34.887 --> 03:47:36.468]  Look at that trash.
[03:47:36.528 --> 03:47:37.369]  Look at this.
[03:47:37.469 --> 03:47:38.610]  And this is what happened.
[03:47:38.850 --> 03:47:42.832]  All these parents trusted her to watch this show.
[03:47:42.872 --> 03:47:44.553]  They trusted, okay, my kid can follow this.
[03:47:44.573 --> 03:47:45.113]  Well, guess what?
[03:47:45.193 --> 03:47:47.014]  Now their kids look like Miley Cyrus.
[03:47:47.054 --> 03:47:47.595]  Right.
[03:47:47.955 --> 03:47:53.378]  And she's like glamorizing doing drugs and all this stuff and being polysexual and all this stuff.
[03:47:53.638 --> 03:47:57.560]  That's a perfect point, excellent Millie, because it's so true.
[03:47:58.001 --> 03:48:02.864]  And think about how many people out there that are amazing musicians, really good quality music.
[03:48:03.264 --> 03:48:06.226]  Why does she get to be blasted out there?
[03:48:06.306 --> 03:48:10.848]  Well, because Disney owns her, and they own her imagery, so they're going to support her.
[03:48:10.948 --> 03:48:18.373]  Just like we said, the megacorporations control everything, so they're going to put out, not who's really the good, naturally good artists, they're going to put whoever they want.
[03:48:19.053 --> 03:48:34.318]  They own her, they own her image, so of course they're going to support her and her message of feminism that she didn't even understand and still frankly doesn't understand it because it's this totally twisted, dyed armpit hair.
[03:48:34.338 --> 03:48:43.800]  Oh, I'm going to put on a hijab and bow down to Islam because it's just so loving and they treat their women so great and equal.
[03:48:43.820 --> 03:48:45.321]  Did she even dye her armpit hair?
[03:48:46.741 --> 03:48:47.382]  I don't know.
[03:48:47.502 --> 03:48:49.463]  I think she's just all natural.
[03:48:49.544 --> 03:48:50.304]  It looked pretty natural.
[03:48:50.404 --> 03:48:51.565]  It looked pretty natural.
[03:48:51.585 --> 03:48:52.806]  Row of hair.
[03:48:52.826 --> 03:48:55.649]  Rainbow didn't go full on rainbow with her.
[03:48:57.375 --> 03:48:59.576]  We should invite her on the show again.
[03:49:00.057 --> 03:49:01.037]  I'm sure she'll be back.
[03:49:01.197 --> 03:49:02.698]  She's very pesky.
[03:49:02.778 --> 03:49:05.040]  She said, you haven't seen the last of me.
[03:49:05.100 --> 03:49:13.845]  And of course we know that these protesters have got this training manual and they are set to continue protesting Trump well into 2018.
[03:49:13.905 --> 03:49:17.667]  They're going to be showing up, causing this mass hysteria.
[03:49:17.947 --> 03:49:20.349]  Is she going to infiltrate Social Justice Warriors?
[03:49:20.729 --> 03:49:21.390]  I don't know.
[03:49:21.410 --> 03:49:24.172]  I don't know.
[03:49:24.252 --> 03:49:28.496]  I guess we'll have to find out whether or not Rainbow Snatch is going to make it.
[03:49:28.576 --> 03:49:37.524]  Okay, well first of all, Steven Crowder was able to infiltrate the protest there dressed as a woman, the one here in Austin, Texas, which I had no idea he was here.
[03:49:38.064 --> 03:49:43.508]  I mean, here he is, his big, burly shoulders and stuff with like this funny sideways wig.
[03:49:43.748 --> 03:49:46.910]  He infiltrated and they were like, yay, we love you, we support you.
[03:49:46.970 --> 03:49:48.912]  But he's really, they're actually just making fun of him.
[03:49:49.052 --> 03:49:49.572]  Welcome to Austin.
[03:49:49.652 --> 03:49:53.475]  So if Steven Crowder can have success with that, I think... You got time for phone calls, do you think?
[03:49:54.035 --> 03:49:57.137]  Well, actually, we have about 10 minutes until the Nightly News.
[03:49:57.177 --> 03:49:58.838]  David Knight is going to be... Oh, that's right.
[03:49:58.858 --> 03:49:59.278]  We're out of time.
[03:49:59.359 --> 03:50:01.500]  We are definitely going to be taking your phone calls later.
[03:50:02.120 --> 03:50:17.370]  After the Nightly News, Alex Jones is going to be doing a live Reddit AMA, and so you can watch that happening here live, or you can also go to the Donald Reddit and kind of look at them side-by-side so you can see the questions that are popping up.
[03:50:18.150 --> 03:50:18.650]  Happening at 8.
[03:50:18.870 --> 03:50:29.094]  I'm I've lost my list of what's happening here tonight with the show, but I know Up next and then it's probably gonna be a free-for-all here till about midnight.
[03:50:29.134 --> 03:50:40.219]  So we will definitely take your phone calls Coming up later I'm sure you guys are just itching to get a call in and see what's happening and talk to Millie Weaver and the rest of the crew So yeah, that's a reddit
[03:50:41.119 --> 03:50:45.701]  At the Donald there, which, of course, that's another thing that's been censored.
[03:50:45.841 --> 03:50:49.842]  Reddit censored the Donald, so you won't see it in trending.
[03:50:50.062 --> 03:50:55.464]  So even when Alex Jones AMA is absolutely going to be dominating Reddit, it's absolutely going to be trending.
[03:50:55.844 --> 03:50:57.885]  You won't see it on their homepage.
[03:50:58.025 --> 03:51:02.566]  You won't see it in the trending bar, just like Facebook can tell you what's trending.
[03:51:02.626 --> 03:51:04.087]  Facebook will tell you what's news.
[03:51:04.387 --> 03:51:05.748]  Twitter doesn't allow
[03:51:07.348 --> 03:51:09.429]  Pro-Trump things to get into the trending.
[03:51:09.690 --> 03:51:18.675]  People actually have to change the spelling on certain hashtags in order to trick the censors there and then they can prove that their topic is actually trending.
[03:51:18.795 --> 03:51:20.736]  Twitter, I mean, it's insane!
[03:51:20.936 --> 03:51:22.637]  It's more than just demonizing you.
[03:51:22.837 --> 03:51:26.700]  It's more than just demonizing Donald Trump or demonizing Alex Jones and Infowars.
[03:51:27.120 --> 03:51:29.101]  It's basically censoring them altogether.
[03:51:29.321 --> 03:51:36.864]  How prolific was it that that judge came here, of all places, a year and a half ago and told us this exact thing?
[03:51:36.984 --> 03:51:42.766]  On and off camera, because he was backstage, you know, talking about it as well in the studio, saying, look, they're coming after us, man.
[03:51:42.786 --> 03:51:43.987]  This is what's going to happen.
[03:51:44.067 --> 03:51:45.267]  Wait, look for it.
[03:51:45.347 --> 03:51:46.128]  It's going to happen.
[03:51:46.148 --> 03:51:53.130]  And that it was a pretty high profile Supreme Court judge that told him a lot of the stuff that they were coming after him.
[03:51:53.190 --> 03:51:53.831]  And then, of course,
[03:51:55.132 --> 03:52:05.490]  Well, maybe, you know, I'm not really sure how many of our listeners actually watch the mainstream media, and I'm sure it's probably not that many, because really and truly, who would watch that?
[03:52:06.231 --> 03:52:08.274]  But if you are, turn it off!
[03:52:09.144 --> 03:52:10.904]  Let's boycott the mainstream media.
[03:52:10.944 --> 03:52:11.725]  Let's turn it off.
[03:52:11.785 --> 03:52:13.165]  Let's hurt their ratings.
[03:52:13.205 --> 03:52:15.006]  Let's hurt their advertisements.
[03:52:15.026 --> 03:52:17.806]  Let's cut their funding.
[03:52:18.266 --> 03:52:22.367]  Let's just boycott the mainstream media because why should we even be watching?
[03:52:22.428 --> 03:52:33.570]  I know it's tempting sometimes to watch them because they're that ridiculous and you want to kind of know what they're saying, but you know, I personally, I don't even have a TV in my house and I refuse to get cable TV.
[03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:34.671]  Yeah, I haven't had one in 15 years.
[03:52:35.971 --> 03:52:38.013]  They do want to have a TV in their house.
[03:52:38.053 --> 03:52:45.800]  What they do is they'll get a TV and then they have these little boxes where they can actually just use the internet to watch shows on their TV.
[03:52:45.960 --> 03:52:52.085]  So you can actually watch the Alex Jones Show or the InfoWars Nightly News Show on your television.
[03:52:52.126 --> 03:52:54.187]  I know people are doing that right now.
[03:52:54.207 --> 03:52:55.268]  They always send in pictures.
[03:52:55.288 --> 03:52:57.070]  They're like, oh, I got you on my big screen.
[03:52:57.330 --> 03:53:00.851]  I personally like watching the mainstream media, but that's because I monitor them.
[03:53:01.132 --> 03:53:02.452]  Owen does too, he has like 10 televisions.
[03:53:02.472 --> 03:53:10.415]  I just catch them and lie after lying, and it's always good to show how they're lying to everyone, and so it's, I tell you what, it's a full-time job.
[03:53:10.575 --> 03:53:13.477]  That's our job though, and that's why it gets a little... That's our job!
[03:53:13.497 --> 03:53:18.119]  We'll watch them and we'll let you know the crazy things they say, but we should really try to boycott them.
[03:53:18.319 --> 03:53:23.581]  We will get adrenal fatigue on your behalf, getting triggered watching the lamestream media.
[03:53:24.269 --> 03:53:29.015]  We'll sit through Rachel Maddow's voice.
[03:53:29.916 --> 03:53:31.958]  I'm not gonna lie guys, I really can't do it.
[03:53:32.018 --> 03:53:37.384]  I don't even own a television, so when I go to Owen's house, I'm like, what is happening here?
[03:53:37.404 --> 03:53:41.569]  Because he's surrounded by televisions, because just like you, he monitors.
[03:53:43.071 --> 03:53:45.053]  He's basically like a baby Alex Jones.
[03:53:45.073 --> 03:53:47.556]  That's good for football.
[03:53:47.916 --> 03:53:48.416]  Exactly.
[03:53:48.457 --> 03:53:50.379]  You can watch all the games all at once.
[03:53:50.679 --> 03:53:53.502]  Nothing wrong with that, because you're doing your thing 24-6.
[03:53:53.702 --> 03:53:58.507]  If that's all we knew was football statistics, that'd be one thing, but we know a lot of other stuff.
[03:53:59.327 --> 03:54:01.089]  That's what balance is key.
[03:54:01.549 --> 03:54:06.031]  So thank you guys so much for sticking with us this these last couple of hours here.
[03:54:06.112 --> 03:54:09.293]  We've got plenty more of the show coming up.
[03:54:09.313 --> 03:54:10.934]  We'll be here with you until midnight.
[03:54:11.415 --> 03:54:16.177]  This is the Info Wars, the Defense of Liberty 13-hour broadcast.
[03:54:16.498 --> 03:54:25.323]  We have got some specials going for you right now so that we can help fight back against this latest attack by the globalists to try to cut off one of our supply channels.
[03:54:25.743 --> 03:54:29.828]  To take us off of the largest online advertising platform.
[03:54:29.868 --> 03:54:37.096]  This is what we're able to use to broadcast our products, our high quality products that are actually helping people.
[03:54:37.116 --> 03:54:38.998]  That's right.
[03:54:39.138 --> 03:54:39.999]  This is what we use.
[03:54:40.039 --> 03:54:44.544]  It's a platform we use to launch this across the world wide web.
[03:54:44.764 --> 03:54:45.085]  Okay?
[03:54:45.345 --> 03:54:46.766]  World wide.
[03:54:47.327 --> 03:54:48.928]  So they have cut this off.
[03:54:48.968 --> 03:54:53.691]  They said, let this serve as your final notice of our decision.
[03:54:54.052 --> 03:54:55.793]  So now more than ever, we need your help.
[03:54:56.313 --> 03:54:57.294]  We need your support.
[03:54:57.554 --> 03:55:00.076]  Help us defend against any incoming attacks.
[03:55:00.416 --> 03:55:01.797]  We've got to keep fighting hard.
[03:55:02.097 --> 03:55:03.818]  Alex wants to hire more people.
[03:55:04.178 --> 03:55:13.925]  And he was planning on doing that with the revenue that would be coming in from this ad roll, because he was just beginning to be able to count on that to be a revenue stream.
[03:55:14.045 --> 03:55:14.825]  And they could cut it.
[03:55:15.066 --> 03:55:15.846]  Just boom.
[03:55:15.906 --> 03:55:16.627]  We'll show you.
[03:55:17.247 --> 03:55:17.407]  You are.
[03:55:17.447 --> 03:55:18.708]  Millions of dollars of revenue.

[03:55:27.234 --> 03:55:30.596]  So, we don't need them, but we do need your support right now.
[03:55:30.677 --> 03:55:31.697]  Go to InfoWarsStore.
[03:55:31.717 --> 03:55:33.979]  We're doing some mega specials.

[03:56:10.066 --> 03:56:17.809]  You know, it almost makes you wonder, too, if, you know, the reason why we see so many beta males out there is because of all the estrogen mimickers out there.
[03:56:17.989 --> 03:56:21.390]  Is it somewhat of a way to try and create beta males?
[03:56:21.450 --> 03:56:28.933]  And luckily, there are products out there, like Super Male Vitality, that can make sure that, you know, you aren't getting that estrogen.
[03:56:28.953 --> 03:56:35.436]  It'll help you out so that you're fully testosterone, full on super male.

[03:57:17.802 --> 03:57:20.185]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[03:57:20.505 --> 03:57:27.914]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
