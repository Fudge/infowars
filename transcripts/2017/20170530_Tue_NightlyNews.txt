[00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:22.601]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:24.742]  It's Tuesday, May 30th, 2017.
[00:00:25.423 --> 00:00:26.504]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:26.724 --> 00:00:29.466]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:30.707 --> 00:00:48.380]  Tonight, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is finally feeling the burn as there is now a class action lawsuit accusing the DNC of election fraud to disenfranchise Bernie Sanders supporters.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:01:10.739]  Meanwhile, GOP lawmakers are calling for a federal investigation into the murder of Seth Rich, as evidence continues to surface that Rich was indeed the individual responsible for the DNC leak to WikiLeaks, proving once and for all that it was not the Russians.
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.106]  All that plus declassified memos prove what InfoWars has been saying all along.
[00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:19.949]  The FBI has been spying on you.
[00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.153]  That's up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:32.022 --> 00:01:39.930]  During this Memorial Day, I want to thank the veterans that have fought, but of course, most importantly, those that have died, because that's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:47.297]  Take advantage of these unprecedented specials and help support the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists while supplies last.

[00:01:51.161 --> 00:01:53.403]  You add auto ship, several of these
[00:01:53.723 --> 00:01:54.484]  Our lost leaders.
[00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:59.770]  So for myself and the entire InfoWars crew, I salute you and thank you for all your prayers on this Memorial Day.
[00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:01.973]  Just understand that without you, there'd be nothing.

[00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:25.225]  Well, the unsolved murder of Seth Rich has gone viral, and this is a story that is not dying, but continues to grow legs, despite what the liberal mainstream media and the Democrat Party would like to see with this story, and that is the complete squashing of any coverage of this at all.
[00:03:25.845 --> 00:03:27.247]  So here's what I'm going to try to do.
[00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:37.897]  Basically, my investigation into this over the course of the last five days, basically I look like a mad scientist on a board with a bunch of pictures and stories and a bunch of lines being drawn in between.
[00:03:37.997 --> 00:03:42.742]  So I'm not going to try to inundate all of that into the coverage here tonight.
[00:03:42.762 --> 00:03:45.405]  What I'm going to do is I'm going to point out facts.
[00:03:45.945 --> 00:03:53.749]  And I'm going to point out the missing links in this investigation that need to be put out there immediately.
[00:03:54.189 --> 00:04:02.593]  Otherwise, this story is going to continue to get bigger and the mystery that is the unsolved murder of Seth Rich is going to continue to get more legs.
[00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:12.417]  And it has been mostly from my experience up to us, independent investigators, to get these answers because we're not getting anything from the DC police.
[00:04:12.817 --> 00:04:21.403]  Nothing from the FBI and nothing from the hospital or the people that treated Seth Rich, all of which is not normal.
[00:04:21.543 --> 00:04:32.071]  You would think with a story of so much coverage and so much importance that they would want to squash any rumors or any false narratives about it by putting this information out there, but they're not doing it.
[00:04:32.431 --> 00:04:35.754]  So let me just give you a summary of the facts that I have
[00:04:36.374 --> 00:04:41.297]  Right now, and the questions that need to be answered, at least in my mind.
[00:04:41.337 --> 00:04:51.563]  I'm not going to get to everything, because some things cannot be verified, and I don't want to report on them yet, but we can verify some things, which leaves a lot of questions begging to be answered.
[00:04:51.903 --> 00:04:54.045]  But let's start at the beginning.
[00:04:54.885 --> 00:04:59.288]  Let's start with the whole beginning of this and what might actually be going on.
[00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:00.449]  What is the motive?
[00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:05.632]  Well, folks, it all starts with a class action lawsuit against the DNC.
[00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:15.327]  Now, this is a lawsuit that is mainly being served by Bernie Sanders supporters represented in 45 different states.
[00:05:16.047 --> 00:05:24.433]  And these are Bernie Sanders supporters who, well, I guess they read the WikiLeaks or saw the superdelegates or the way the Democrats ran the campaign.
[00:05:25.393 --> 00:05:28.936]  Well, they wanted Bernie to get in, but they never saw that he got a fair shot.
[00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:45.209]  See, the Democrats, they rigged the election for Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders either unknowingly screwed himself by running as a Democrat, or perhaps was playing into the Democrat plan to put Hillary up there to begin with, but that's neither here nor there.
[00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:56.400]  So, Bernie Sanders supporters who gave a lot of money to the DNC, a lot of people gave a lot of money to the DNC because they hoped that Bernie Sanders would get elected.
[00:05:56.761 --> 00:06:08.352]  And even though he was clearly more popular than Hillary Clinton during the rallies and a lot of these primaries, well, Hillary Clinton still came out on top because she had the superdelegates.
[00:06:09.451 --> 00:06:11.172]  But there was some foul play involved.
[00:06:11.552 --> 00:06:24.359]  And this came out via the WikiLeaks with leaked questions to media, media collusion, oh goodness, superdelegates, and more so than what we even know was probably going on.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.901]  And this is where Seth Rich comes into play.
[00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:34.525]  You see, Seth Rich was not just a regular Democrat staffer, he was with the IT department, especially
[00:06:35.365 --> 00:06:38.947]  When it came to logging voter rolls and voter outreach.
[00:06:39.227 --> 00:06:54.675]  So Seth Rich not just had the IT skills and the technical skills to kind of amass a great knowledge of what the Democrat voter base was thinking and wanting in the last election cycle, but also he knew the numbers.
[00:06:54.955 --> 00:06:57.418]  Because he was the one that was working with it.
[00:06:57.718 --> 00:06:59.640]  That's a lot of important intel.
[00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:15.057]  And when he found out that the Democrats were going to put Hillary Clinton up there instead of Bernie Sanders, despite the overwhelming support of Bernie Sanders, and all the money that came in from just grassroots Democrats, that they were still going to give it to Hillary,
[00:07:15.598 --> 00:07:17.199]  Well, Seth Rich didn't really like that.
[00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:25.684]  Now, he's been doing some other things with Kim.com and apparently had a pseudonym named Panda trying to work with the Internet Party, but that's still not here nor there.
[00:07:25.704 --> 00:07:32.329]  What we're talking about is Seth Rich knowing things about the Democrat Party
[00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:42.001]  Specifically with voting numbers and why Hillary Clinton won the Democrat nomination and not Bernie Sanders.
[00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:47.808]  So that's just one angle that brings about this lawsuit against the DNC.
[00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:52.509]  So, Seth Rich gets killed.
[00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:54.450]  This is a story that has a lot of mystery to it.
[00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.212]  They say it's a robbery, yet nothing was robbed off of him.
[00:07:57.893 --> 00:07:59.894]  And, you know, he's walking home late.
[00:07:59.954 --> 00:08:02.356]  Apparently, he's on the phone with his girlfriend when it happens.
[00:08:03.137 --> 00:08:06.900]  Apparently, he was on the phone literally when it was happening.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.542]  The police say that there looks like foul play.
[00:08:10.302 --> 00:08:16.226]  And of course he was shot, but not dead, on the scene, and then had to go to the hospital.
[00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:18.628]  Now, that story says Howard University Hospital.
[00:08:18.668 --> 00:08:19.609]  Here's the thing about that.
[00:08:19.989 --> 00:08:28.435]  Howard University Hospital does not actually have the proper trauma center to actually help a shooting victim, so he would have gone to MedStar.
[00:08:28.735 --> 00:08:29.936]  But we'll get to that in a second.
[00:08:30.316 --> 00:08:41.400]  So, Seth Rich, a staffer who may have had important intel when it came to voter rolls with this lawsuit coming up, gets shot and he is dead.
[00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:54.526]  Now, who actually gave the lawsuit to Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who, by the way, got fired for the activities that she did as a political staffer of the Democrats?
[00:08:55.586 --> 00:08:59.173]  Well, that would be Sean Lucas, who gave Debbie Wasserman Schultz those papers.
[00:08:59.855 --> 00:09:01.218]  And what happened to Sean Lucas?
[00:09:02.099 --> 00:09:03.161]  He is now dead.
[00:09:03.723 --> 00:09:04.765]  So he gets shot.
[00:09:05.105 --> 00:09:05.667]  So Seth Rich...
[00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:15.554]  He gets shot, a Democrat staffer that had the intel on the numbers with the IT on the Democrat voting base.
[00:09:16.075 --> 00:09:22.959]  And then the man who served Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the lawsuit, Sean Lucas, is also found dead.
[00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:24.419]  And guess what?
[00:09:24.499 --> 00:09:27.021]  We don't even get to know what caused his death.
[00:09:27.161 --> 00:09:28.362]  They don't even tell us.
[00:09:29.082 --> 00:09:31.243]  He just has a mysterious death.
[00:09:31.883 --> 00:09:33.043]  I believe it was in his bathroom.
[00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:35.484]  His girlfriend had to come home and find him dead.
[00:09:36.084 --> 00:09:37.864]  Nobody knows what happened to him.
[00:09:38.684 --> 00:09:40.985]  Now, here's a new breaking one!
[00:09:42.685 --> 00:09:48.787]  Federal prosecutor found dead as his body mysteriously floated in waves on Florida beach.
[00:09:49.147 --> 00:09:49.787]  Get this!
[00:09:51.021 --> 00:09:52.021]  This is unbelievable.
[00:09:52.442 --> 00:09:58.364]  A federal prosecutor found dead on the beach with head trauma.
[00:09:59.344 --> 00:10:02.825]  A 37-year-old, guess what he was investigating?
[00:10:03.586 --> 00:10:06.267]  Visa and passport fraud cases.
[00:10:07.767 --> 00:10:09.928]  Un-be-lievable.
[00:10:10.728 --> 00:10:17.731]  Now, some of the illegal voting that may have been going on within the Democrat Party, who would have known about that?
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.661]  This federal prosecutor, Barrington Wisenhunt, he would have.
[00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:34.343]  If the numbers were so obviously in favor of Bernie Sanders and not Hillary Clinton, whether they had legal voter rolls or not, who would have known that?
[00:10:35.223 --> 00:10:36.723]  Seth Rich.
[00:10:37.563 --> 00:10:44.285]  Now, who was bringing this all to the front with a lawsuit right to the doorstep of the Democrat National Campaign and Committee?
[00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:45.865]  Sean Lucas.
[00:10:46.894 --> 00:10:48.495]  All three dead.
[00:10:49.555 --> 00:10:54.257]  And you know what they say, dead man tell no tales.
[00:10:55.618 --> 00:11:12.306]  Now, let's flash back for a second and go to the infamous email from John Podesta where he says, and I quote, I'm definitely for making an example of a suspected leaker whether or not we have any real, real basis for it.
[00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:14.947]  Okay.
[00:11:16.098 --> 00:11:30.807]  Seth Rich, Shawn Lucas, and excuse me, I forgot the latest one, Barrington Wisenhunt, all dead, obviously there were leaks, and here's John Podesta saying he's for making examples of leakers, whether they have a basis for it or not.
[00:11:31.167 --> 00:11:33.368]  So maybe Seth Rich was a leaker, maybe he wasn't.
[00:11:33.828 --> 00:11:40.252]  John Podesta said he wanted to make an example of a leaker, whether there was a basis for it or not.
[00:11:40.912 --> 00:11:43.714]  Now do we have any basis to believe that Seth Rich was the leaker?
[00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:44.815]  Absolutely.
[00:11:45.535 --> 00:11:49.183]  In fact, there's more basis for that than to anything to do with Russia.
[00:11:49.383 --> 00:11:51.307]  Just ask Julian Assange.
[00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:53.391]  But there you go.
[00:11:53.632 --> 00:11:55.015]  There's John Podesta.
[00:11:55.897 --> 00:11:56.037]  Now...
[00:11:57.076 --> 00:11:58.978]  We'll get back to the Podestas in a second.
[00:11:58.998 --> 00:12:01.921]  It's not like the Podestas have anything to hide here.
[00:12:02.341 --> 00:12:03.902]  Nothing was shown in their emails.
[00:12:03.942 --> 00:12:04.743]  That's sketchy.
[00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:07.286]  Nothing sketchy happening with the Democrat Party.
[00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:08.967]  These three deaths, I'm sure, are just a coincidence.
[00:12:09.368 --> 00:12:12.451]  Much like all the other things that I'm about to cover, I'm sure they're just a coincidence.
[00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:13.912]  How about this for a coincidence?
[00:12:14.352 --> 00:12:17.776]  Weapons stolen from an FBI vehicle in Northeast D.C.
[00:12:18.136 --> 00:12:22.100]  This is the same morning that Seth Rich was killed!
[00:12:23.328 --> 00:12:40.211]  Seth Rich, actually I believe it was July 10th, it says July 11th, but I think, I haven't actually double checked those times, but I believe that right here they're saying these weapons, 645 to 749 AM, Seth Rich I believe was shot at 557 AM.
[00:12:41.372 --> 00:12:41.932]  With what?
[00:12:42.572 --> 00:12:44.092]  Stolen handguns?
[00:12:44.812 --> 00:12:48.493]  What was stolen from the FBI in Northeast DC where Seth Rich was shot?
[00:12:49.403 --> 00:12:50.023]  Handguns?
[00:12:50.664 --> 00:12:58.009]  Again though, I'm sure that this is just a coincidence, but you would think that the FBI would have answers on this.
[00:12:58.689 --> 00:13:06.114]  They would be able to tell you what type of caliber weapons were stolen and what type of caliber weapons and bullets was used on Seth Rich.
[00:13:06.934 --> 00:13:07.755]  No answers there.
[00:13:07.815 --> 00:13:10.677]  So there's a missing link that should be easy to answer.
[00:13:10.737 --> 00:13:11.497]  Shouldn't even be hard.
[00:13:11.817 --> 00:13:14.079]  Alright, now let's look at some of these coincidences, folks.
[00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:17.101]  These are the new revelations that are being brought to the forefront here.
[00:13:18.305 --> 00:13:21.627]  First of all, it's already been said that the D.C.
[00:13:21.708 --> 00:13:24.550]  Police, it looks like, may be attempting a cover-up.
[00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:25.971]  Why would they be doing that?
[00:13:26.271 --> 00:13:29.793]  That's right, because Heather Podesta has served on the D.C.
[00:13:29.914 --> 00:13:30.674]  Police Board.
[00:13:31.375 --> 00:13:34.997]  John Podesta, Hillary Clinton, Heather Podesta, D.C.
[00:13:35.057 --> 00:13:35.698]  Police Board.
[00:13:35.998 --> 00:13:37.639]  I'm sure that's just all a coincidence.
[00:13:38.019 --> 00:13:39.180]  But it goes deeper.
[00:13:39.541 --> 00:13:44.404]  And I want to be very clear as I'm getting these new names involved with this investigation.
[00:13:44.945 --> 00:13:46.426]  I'm not accusing them of anything.
[00:13:47.026 --> 00:13:48.848]  I'm not saying they've done anything wrong.
[00:13:49.308 --> 00:13:54.933]  All I'm doing as an independent journalist and investigator is connecting dots and asking questions.
[00:13:55.213 --> 00:13:59.137]  So I just want to go on record that I'm not accusing any of these people of wrongdoing.
[00:13:59.157 --> 00:14:03.100]  I'm simply making connections here and asking questions.
[00:14:03.981 --> 00:14:05.522]  Lisa Contupez.
[00:14:05.962 --> 00:14:07.544]  Now I might be pronouncing this name wrong.
[00:14:07.584 --> 00:14:08.425]  It's really unimportant.
[00:14:09.165 --> 00:14:15.226]  Lisa Countoupes is, I quote this story from the Hill, she's a leading lobbyist.
[00:14:15.266 --> 00:14:17.267]  In fact, she was considered a top lobbyist.
[00:14:17.307 --> 00:14:20.528]  Guys, if you scroll down, you can find Lisa down the page there.
[00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:21.408]  She's pretty far down.
[00:14:21.848 --> 00:14:26.349]  This is a list of all the top lobbyists in 2016.
[00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:29.730]  Lisa Countoupes, a Clinton administration veteran.
[00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:35.931]  Countoupes has been working on everything from drug approval reform to cyber security.
[00:14:36.531 --> 00:14:47.625]  Hmm, cyber security, DNC leaks, Seth Rich, WikiLeaks, hacking, Lisa Countoupes, and again, a Clinton administrative veteran.
[00:14:47.665 --> 00:14:49.007]  So why do I bring her up?
[00:14:49.167 --> 00:14:49.908]  Well, Lisa...
[00:14:50.973 --> 00:15:10.902]  Count Toupees, again I hope I'm pronouncing this right, apparently, and this is stuff where I'm not an expert at, but I'm just reporting what I found, apparently she was on the Energy and Commerce Committee during the Uranium One deal that Hillary Clinton's State Department made
[00:15:11.562 --> 00:15:21.528]  While she was in the State Department, and here is the disclosure form that shows that Lisa Countoupes was part of that transaction.
[00:15:22.229 --> 00:15:27.332]  So again, I'm sure that this is just another coincidence, but let's move on.
[00:15:27.352 --> 00:15:30.654]  Do you guys have this flyer for Katie McGinty here?
[00:15:31.721 --> 00:15:37.747]  Please join co-host Lisa Countoupes, John Podesta, Tony Podesta for Katie McGinty.
[00:15:37.787 --> 00:15:49.339]  Again, I'm not saying Katie McGinty did anything wrong or Lisa did anything wrong, but now what we have is Katie, or excuse me, Lisa Countoupes lobbying for Katie McGinty with John Podesta, with Tony Podesta.
[00:15:49.719 --> 00:15:52.142]  They can be found on a lot of, yeah, there you go guys.
[00:15:53.142 --> 00:15:57.946]  Lisa Countoupes, John Podesta, Tony Podesta can be found lobbying for people all the time.
[00:15:57.986 --> 00:16:00.268]  Again, this is just one example here with Katie McGinty.
[00:16:00.628 --> 00:16:07.614]  Another thing we have is the Podestas and Lisa Countoupes on all sorts of travel lists with the Clintons.
[00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:11.181]  And this is where it gets even weirder.
[00:16:11.761 --> 00:16:27.171]  Included with Lisa Countoupe's on these lists for parties, for Democrat events, on these travel lists with the Clintons, is her, I guess, her spouse, I really don't know this, but is in a known relationship with Dr. Jack Sava.
[00:16:27.631 --> 00:16:33.195]  Again, I'm not implying that anything is being done wrong by these people, but you have to wonder.
[00:16:33.876 --> 00:16:38.439]  Dr. Jack Sava is, this is fact,
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:49.761]  He is the MD who is in charge of trauma surgery at MedStar Health, which is where Seth Rich would have been sent to receive surgery.
[00:16:50.936 --> 00:16:59.225]  So again, I'm sure that this is just a coincidence that these people have these connections, but these are the questions we need answered.
[00:16:59.686 --> 00:17:04.631]  Why are we not getting the footage from all the cameras at the scene where Seth Rich was died, was killed?
[00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:10.838]  Why are we not getting interviews with the bar, with the people that run the bar, and the people who were at the bar the night Seth Rich was killed?
[00:17:11.098 --> 00:17:11.719]  Nothing on that.
[00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:16.462]  Why don't we get the footage from the police chest cams that they had on that night?
[00:17:16.543 --> 00:17:17.143]  Nothing on that.
[00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:28.172]  And then the big motzball that is sitting out there now, and I'm just asking Dr. Jack Sava, maybe you can help, why don't we get the records from the night Seth Rich entered the hospital?
[00:17:28.412 --> 00:17:32.456]  We need to know what hospital he went to and who provided care to him.
[00:17:32.756 --> 00:17:35.018]  But we're not getting those answers, are we?
[00:17:36.232 --> 00:17:40.057]  And that is the biggest smoke of them all, folks.
[00:17:40.878 --> 00:17:42.520]  They say where there's smoke, there's fire.
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.622]  Why wouldn't they be answering these questions?
[00:17:44.982 --> 00:17:48.987]  Why wouldn't they be investigating into all of this footage that we know was there?
[00:17:49.308 --> 00:17:50.449]  Why wouldn't the D.C.
[00:17:50.489 --> 00:17:55.175]  police be questioning the people who were at the bar that night and the bar owners?
[00:17:55.695 --> 00:18:06.741]  Why wouldn't they want to investigate or at least put out to the public to quell this firestorm that is hashtag Seth Rich, find out what hospital he went to, and who provided care for him?
[00:18:07.081 --> 00:18:09.022]  We're not getting these answers, folks.
[00:18:09.263 --> 00:18:12.264]  So here I am, putting it all together, just connecting the dots.
[00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:13.245]  That's all we're doing.
[00:18:13.445 --> 00:18:14.886]  I'm not accusing anyone of anything.
[00:18:15.586 --> 00:18:33.818]  You've got Heather Podesta on the police board, you've got Lisa Countoupes and Dr. Jack Sava, who are involved with the Democrats, involved in the hospital, where Seth Rich would have gone, and of course, it all ties back into Seth Rich, Shawn Lucas, and the latest, Barrington Wisenhunt Jr.
[00:18:34.118 --> 00:18:37.060]  We're not getting these answers, we deserve these answers, but guess what?
[00:18:38.021 --> 00:18:42.524]  We have someone who's also looking for these answers, finally involved, he's from Texas,
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.580]  Let me make sure I get this right.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.641]  Blake Farentold.
[00:18:48.761 --> 00:18:55.503]  Blake Farentold, a congressman from Texas, is now calling for a special investigation into the murder of Seth Rich.
[00:18:55.783 --> 00:18:59.604]  It's time for all of the American people to do the exact same thing.
[00:19:01.545 --> 00:19:04.285]  During this Memorial Day, I want to thank the veterans that have fought.
[00:19:05.326 --> 00:19:07.246]  But of course, most importantly, those that have died.
[00:19:07.866 --> 00:19:10.447]  Because that's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[00:19:11.727 --> 00:19:13.648]  It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:19:14.574 --> 00:19:16.175]  For the belief they were building a better world.
[00:19:16.715 --> 00:19:18.176]  Didn't mean every war was good.
[00:19:18.236 --> 00:19:19.537]  Didn't mean they didn't get conned.
[00:19:19.777 --> 00:19:21.078]  Didn't mean they didn't get used.
[00:19:21.698 --> 00:19:25.100]  But I'm here to tell you, they were at least people that were willing to stand up for something.
[00:19:25.521 --> 00:19:33.405]  And that's worlds apart from so many of the trendies and globalist wannabes and minions of the establishment that want to take the easy road.
[00:19:33.886 --> 00:19:37.188]  Take advantage of these unprecedented specials and help support
[00:19:37.768 --> 00:19:40.850]  The tip of the spear in the fight against the global is while supplies last.
[00:19:41.511 --> 00:19:50.477]  Our highest quality, name brand, silver bullet that we private label is already the highest quality and lowest price of what we sell it at.
[00:19:50.897 --> 00:19:55.160]  And I've never offered it as a lost leader like I'm about to do.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.363]  At 65% off retail right through next Tuesday.
[00:20:01.184 --> 00:20:03.105]  Supermelt Vitality has been sold out for months.
[00:20:03.205 --> 00:20:05.146]  Our number one best-selling product.
[00:20:05.647 --> 00:20:06.547]  I normally just give 25% off.
[00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:14.132]  We are doing 30% off Super Mel Vitality out of the gates through next Tuesday.
[00:20:15.072 --> 00:20:21.036]  Survival Shield, high quality, true nascent iodine, deep earth crystal source, has been sold out.
[00:20:21.456 --> 00:20:23.498]  We never offer it at 40% off.
[00:20:24.378 --> 00:20:31.843]  It's offered at 40% off for a limited time to again celebrate our patriots and celebrate those that died at the service of this great republic.
[00:20:32.628 --> 00:20:38.473]  Brain Force, now with 20% more in each bottle, is 47% off.
[00:20:38.813 --> 00:20:40.955]  We've, again, never offered it at that.
[00:20:41.595 --> 00:20:42.336]  It's a best seller.
[00:20:42.496 --> 00:20:43.277]  It's been sold out.
[00:20:43.657 --> 00:20:44.658]  Why am I discounting it?
[00:20:45.458 --> 00:20:47.340]  Because I know it's a tough economy out there.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.482]  I know the globalists have been trying to stop the Trump recovery.
[00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:51.864]  And I know this is a powerful product.
[00:20:51.924 --> 00:20:55.306]  And so if you try it, I think you're going to continue to want to buy it.
[00:20:56.127 --> 00:21:00.531]  Especially if you sign up for AutoShip, that's an additional 10% off.
[00:21:00.811 --> 00:21:01.772]  When you add that in,
[00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:05.002]  To 65% off Silver Bullet.
[00:21:05.743 --> 00:21:07.084]  It is a loss leader then, for sure.
[00:21:07.524 --> 00:21:10.646]  You add that to the 30% off Supermail, that's 40% off.
[00:21:11.106 --> 00:21:14.689]  You add that to Survival Show, that's 40%, that's 50% off.
[00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:18.271]  You add that to Brain Force at 47, that's 57% off.
[00:21:18.651 --> 00:21:21.313]  You add that to Secret Trouble at 43%, our vitamin B12 mythical modelman, that is 53%.
[00:21:21.353 --> 00:21:22.834]  Knockout is at 50%, our sleep aid, that's 60%.
[00:21:22.874 --> 00:21:24.235]  We've never offered it at that.
[00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:35.674]  And all InfoWars Trump shirts are 75% off retail as well.
[00:21:36.235 --> 00:21:37.456]  To get the word out.
[00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:40.939]  These are the biggest sales ever on these items.
[00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:44.642]  You add auto ship, several of these are lost leaders.
[00:21:44.662 --> 00:21:51.609]  So for myself and the entire InfoWars crew, I salute you and thank you for all your prayers and all your support on this Memorial Day.
[00:21:51.629 --> 00:21:54.772]  Hope everybody has a safe weekend coming up.
[00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:57.254]  We are at that crossroads.
[00:22:02.162 --> 00:22:03.823]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:22:04.003 --> 00:22:10.446]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:22:10.607 --> 00:22:13.668]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:13.768 --> 00:22:23.193]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:22:23.554 --> 00:22:24.154]  Caveman.
[00:22:24.394 --> 00:22:29.377]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:22:29.457 --> 00:22:31.578]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:22:31.878 --> 00:22:35.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.804]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:22:40.164 --> 00:22:47.909]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:22:48.309 --> 00:22:56.055]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:22:56.075 --> 00:23:00.918]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and fullwarslife.com today.
[00:23:03.038 --> 00:23:20.050]  One of the things that's been paralyzing the Trump administration, of course, is the Russians hacked the election narrative, what I call the red herring Russian conspiracy theory that has been put out by the Democrats and by the establishment, both the press and the intelligence services.
[00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:26.955]  You have to understand, as we pointed out last week, there's been no evidence, there's no direct allegations, just innuendo.
[00:23:27.376 --> 00:23:31.419]  And this was underscored when Brennan testified before the House committee
[00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:36.062]  And they asked him directly, Trey Gowdy asked him, what about the evidence?
[00:23:36.102 --> 00:23:37.923]  And he said, I don't do evidence.
[00:23:37.983 --> 00:23:39.204]  He says, well, I understand that.
[00:23:39.424 --> 00:23:43.147]  Clearly you could give us something that is concrete here.
[00:23:43.227 --> 00:23:45.348]  And he kept waffling on that, going back and forth.
[00:23:45.368 --> 00:23:50.812]  But now we're starting to see one of the purposes that we've mentioned before, but is now starting to come out.
[00:23:50.852 --> 00:23:51.272]  And that is
[00:23:52.347 --> 00:23:55.391]  One element of this is to cover up their criminal activities.
[00:23:55.911 --> 00:23:58.594]  We know that this is really to paralyze Trump.
[00:23:58.694 --> 00:23:59.875]  That's one of the purposes of it.
[00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:01.157]  Hopefully to impeach him.
[00:24:01.637 --> 00:24:06.543]  Also they want to intensify the Cold War that they restarted under Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[00:24:06.903 --> 00:24:09.586]  But a key part of this Russian conspiracy theory is to
[00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:15.970]  Cover up the illegal actions that the Obama administration did that involved the NSA and the FBI.
[00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.531]  And this is not coming from anonymous sources.
[00:24:18.571 --> 00:24:24.092]  This is coming from the FISA court itself in a recently released decision.
[00:24:24.732 --> 00:24:34.335]  But if we go back and we look at what Michael Hayden said a few years ago when he was speaking at a university, I think it's very interesting and it provides, I think, a background for this.
[00:24:34.355 --> 00:24:35.275]  Remember, Michael Hayden
[00:24:35.655 --> 00:24:41.238]  ...was Director of the CIA, Director of the NSA at one point in time, also Director of National Intelligence.
[00:24:41.818 --> 00:24:49.101]  He served under both Obama and Bush, or maybe more accurately we could say that those two presidents served under him.
[00:24:49.401 --> 00:24:52.643]  But here's what he had to say about what he's interested in.
[00:24:52.663 --> 00:24:54.503]  This is not about guilt.
[00:24:54.864 --> 00:24:58.625]  In fact, in fact, let me be really clear, okay?
[00:24:59.526 --> 00:25:02.587]  NSA doesn't just listen to bad people.
[00:25:04.214 --> 00:25:06.587]  NSA listens to interesting people.
[00:25:08.595 --> 00:25:09.075]  People?
[00:25:10.116 --> 00:25:10.696]  Isn't that funny?
[00:25:10.736 --> 00:25:12.297]  They listen to interesting people.
[00:25:12.317 --> 00:25:13.718]  Well, who do you think they would find interesting?
[00:25:13.738 --> 00:25:16.220]  Would it be maybe somebody that's a political opponent?
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:23.565]  Somebody that would like to restrict the powers of this dark surveillance state that is unaccountable to the people?
[00:25:23.945 --> 00:25:28.308]  Maybe somebody that would try to cut the military-industrial complex or their wars?
[00:25:28.708 --> 00:25:30.870]  Today we had some breaking information.
[00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.571]  This is Carter Page.
[00:25:32.791 --> 00:25:38.155]  His name has been bandied about quite a bit by the press, by the dark state, the deep state.
[00:25:38.795 --> 00:25:45.057]  He says, uh, this Russian investigation will unearth Obama administration's falsified FISA warrants against me.
[00:25:45.097 --> 00:25:52.860]  Now, this is coming after we reported last week the FISA court coming out and saying that they did this stuff illegally, without warrants.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:58.682]  But then he's going beyond this and saying, no, they actually did get a warrant for him, but they falsified information to get it.
[00:25:59.102 --> 00:26:03.086]  Carter Page, as Breitbart points out, is an American oil industry consultant.
[00:26:03.146 --> 00:26:07.510]  He was tangentially and briefly associated with the Trump campaign.
[00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:15.958]  He's calling out US officials who have been behind highly damaging leaks about him to the news media, alleging that the leakers committed felonies.
[00:26:15.998 --> 00:26:19.461]  He wrote this in a letter to the House Select Committee on Intelligence.
[00:26:20.001 --> 00:26:24.646]  He charges the episode will expose the Obama administration's use of false evidence.
[00:26:25.146 --> 00:26:25.306]  Okay.
[00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:54.812]  Propaganda that they use against us, but they would use it against the very political officials who could end this if they had the backbone and the guts or if they weren't too compromised and blackmailed by what the National Intelligence Service is doing to them.
[00:26:54.872 --> 00:27:06.540]  Page maintained that when the falsified quote FISA warrants against me are eventually revealed, the extent of illegal false evidence will show that there was never any probable cause but rather vindictive personal attacks
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:12.362]  Used to justify the Clinton-Obama-Comey regime's domestic political intelligence operation.
[00:27:12.943 --> 00:27:27.469]  Now this points out that the Washington Post cited on April 11th, law enforcement and other officials stating that as part of their investigation into alleged Russian collusion, the FBI obtained a secret FISA court order last summer to monitor his communications.
[00:27:27.969 --> 00:27:31.650]  They acknowledged that they were reporting on leaked information.
[00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.411]  They say these are anonymous people.
[00:27:33.431 --> 00:27:35.212]  They're not authorized to talk on the record.
[00:27:35.652 --> 00:27:37.794]  All the stuff that we have heard over and over again.
[00:27:37.814 --> 00:27:52.705]  He says that the FBI, the Post further reported, the FBI and Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting his communications after convincing a FISA court judge that there was probable cause to believe that he was acting as the agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia.
[00:27:53.405 --> 00:28:03.553]  Now Page himself, and this is very important, they point out Page has appealed for a public disclosure of the justification for what he refers to as an illegitimate FISA warrant.
[00:28:04.363 --> 00:28:04.883]  How about that?
[00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:06.043]  Wouldn't it be nice?
[00:28:06.063 --> 00:28:11.685]  We just had the FISA court call out the Obama administration and said this is an egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:28:11.885 --> 00:28:14.106]  Well, this is an egregious violation of the Sixth Amendment.
[00:28:14.766 --> 00:28:26.589]  This man has been tried in the court of public opinion by the intelligence, politicized intelligence agencies and the Washington Post in violation of the Sixth Amendment.
[00:28:26.689 --> 00:28:31.511]  Remember, the Sixth Amendment says that you have a right to a public and speedy trial.
[00:28:32.071 --> 00:28:37.015]  You will be informed of the accusations and the cause of those accusations against you.
[00:28:37.055 --> 00:28:39.577]  You will be allowed to address them in public.
[00:28:40.058 --> 00:28:43.080]  You'll be able to call witnesses to give your side of the story.
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.241]  You'll have a defense counsel.
[00:28:44.642 --> 00:28:50.466]  None of that is given to the people who are being railroaded by our intelligence services.
[00:28:51.127 --> 00:28:54.589]  By the spies that we have hired to spy on foreign agents.
[00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:58.492]  They are now involved in open political intrigue in this country.
[00:29:21.067 --> 00:29:21.207]  I don't
[00:29:39.764 --> 00:29:43.688]  That the FBI is involved in this and not only the NSA.
[00:29:44.248 --> 00:29:55.218]  We see in this latest report from Circa, they're saying the FBI has illegally shared raw intelligence about Americans with unauthorized third parties and violated other constitutional privacy protections.
[00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:59.801]  Now they said that this was information that was lawfully collected.
[00:30:00.281 --> 00:30:14.207]  However, when we look at this, they're pointing out that these are people, they said they found several instances in which the FBI acquired communications on the same day that the NSA determined through analysis of intercepted communications that the person was in the United States.
[00:30:15.322 --> 00:30:18.183]  Okay, they were supposedly gathering this on people who were abroad.
[00:30:18.723 --> 00:30:31.708]  Understand, if we look at section 702, the first thing it says is this authority allows only targeting for foreign intelligence purposes of communications of foreign persons who are located abroad.
[00:30:33.151 --> 00:30:33.791]  Think about that.
[00:30:34.152 --> 00:30:36.553]  They're looking at Americans who are in America.
[00:30:36.573 --> 00:30:37.494]  They're not even abroad.
[00:30:38.114 --> 00:30:46.199]  And of course, they tried to extend this by saying, well, if somebody is talking about them, then we can start to listen to them.
[00:30:46.619 --> 00:30:48.601]  But then, even then, they're not supposed to unmask them.
[00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:51.823]  Remember, Susan Rice was caught unmasking these people.
[00:30:52.303 --> 00:30:53.624]  That's the violations here.
[00:30:54.084 --> 00:30:55.885]  This is the Patriot Act.
[00:30:55.945 --> 00:30:58.767]  This is not even the Constitution that they swore to uphold.
[00:30:59.107 --> 00:30:59.948]  This is the law.
[00:31:00.048 --> 00:31:01.469]  And of course, the Obama administration
[00:31:01.969 --> 00:31:03.892]  ...said that they were going to ease the rules.
[00:31:03.912 --> 00:31:05.774]  They had a minimization procedure.
[00:31:05.814 --> 00:31:12.863]  They said, we're going to put in safeguards that are going to minimize the burden on civil rights caused by the intrusion of the federal government into citizens' lives.
[00:31:13.443 --> 00:31:17.528]  You're going to minimize the violations of the supreme law of the land?
[00:31:18.129 --> 00:31:24.218]  You're going to minimize the violations of our individual liberty in the name of giving us safety and security?
[00:31:24.899 --> 00:31:33.392]  Now they say that they're going to take a look at this and this is going to be very important as they look for reauthorization of that part of the Patriot Act that has allowed them to do this.
[00:31:34.366 --> 00:31:44.072]  But let's hope that somebody in Congress will realize that even though these people who say one bombing after the other, they say, well, you need our protection against this.
[00:31:44.112 --> 00:31:46.473]  They always know who the bombers are.
[00:31:46.513 --> 00:31:47.934]  They fail to do anything about it.
[00:31:47.974 --> 00:31:50.075]  They fail to vet the people who are in this country.
[00:31:50.395 --> 00:31:53.117]  They fail to take them out of this country or imprison them.
[00:31:53.797 --> 00:31:57.159]  And then they tell us we need more violations of your individual liberty.
[00:31:57.659 --> 00:31:58.860]  That is where this is going.
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.461]  That is what needs to stop.
[00:32:00.621 --> 00:32:03.963]  So you need to wake up and share with your neighbors what is happening.
[00:32:04.003 --> 00:32:05.564]  This is a loaded gun to your head.
[00:32:06.265 --> 00:32:12.149]  This may sound like a lot of legal mumbo-jumbo to a lot of you, but understand that the law is a tool.
[00:32:12.709 --> 00:32:15.411]  Like any tool, it can be used for good or for bad.
[00:32:15.471 --> 00:32:20.114]  Like a gun, it can be used to defend life or it can be used to take life criminally.
[00:32:20.874 --> 00:32:25.056]  And I want to play for you what Michael Hayden said, because this illustrates the true danger.
[00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:27.797]  Here's what he said about whether or not he needed the law.
[00:32:28.877 --> 00:32:30.258]  All your talk today about 215.
[00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:35.941]  215 is such a safe haven.
[00:32:36.981 --> 00:32:38.542]  215 is legislated by Congress.
[00:32:39.502 --> 00:32:45.745]  I was doing metadata collection under the President's raw Article 2 authorities from October 7, 2001 forward.
[00:32:45.985 --> 00:32:48.426]  The 215 program doesn't begin with the Patriot Act.
[00:32:49.343 --> 00:32:51.586]  That begins with the private order I got from President Bush.
[00:32:52.367 --> 00:32:56.793]  And we decided it was lawful and consistent with the President's authorities as Commander-in-Chief.
[00:32:57.615 --> 00:32:59.537]  They decided, not the law.
[00:32:59.798 --> 00:33:00.499]  That's the danger.
[00:33:02.262 --> 00:33:04.303]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:33:04.563 --> 00:33:05.883]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[00:34:01.827 --> 00:34:03.268]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:31.726]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:34:31.987 --> 00:34:41.955]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:34:42.195 --> 00:34:44.157]  And this part is most important.
[00:34:44.257 --> 00:34:50.742]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:34:51.062 --> 00:34:52.183]  That means it's clean.
[00:34:52.503 --> 00:34:53.403]  That means it's pure.

[00:34:56.525 --> 00:34:59.106]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:59.326 --> 00:35:00.987]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:01.867 --> 00:35:06.230]  We have the new product at Infowarslife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:17.275]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.435 --> 00:35:22.378]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.478 --> 00:35:24.999]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.059 --> 00:35:26.560]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.622]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.662 --> 00:35:34.404]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.444 --> 00:35:40.668]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:35:40.708 --> 00:35:46.010]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.791]  I'm taking it now.
[00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:47.532]  Every day.
[00:35:47.732 --> 00:35:48.453]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:51.036]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[00:35:51.277 --> 00:35:53.019]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.039 --> 00:35:55.142]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.282 --> 00:35:58.726]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.099 --> 00:36:08.262]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.642 --> 00:36:11.524]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:11.864 --> 00:36:17.067]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.487 --> 00:36:23.450]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:26.732]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:26.892 --> 00:36:28.313]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.533 --> 00:36:32.674]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:32.854 --> 00:36:35.735]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:35.815 --> 00:36:37.376]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.476 --> 00:36:40.657]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:40.937 --> 00:36:43.257]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.537 --> 00:36:44.498]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.598 --> 00:36:47.298]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.479 --> 00:36:48.079]  I take this.
[00:36:48.199 --> 00:36:49.879]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:49.999 --> 00:36:51.960]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:52.801 --> 00:36:53.563]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:53.603 --> 00:36:54.445]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:36:54.766 --> 00:36:58.957]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLive.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:10.674 --> 00:37:18.919]  You know, and just to be clear, I'm just reporting on the things that I can with the Seth Rich thing, just to go back to the first segment.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.023]  There are other folks out there who have different angles that have broken other tidbits of news with this.
[00:37:24.383 --> 00:37:25.364]  George Webb is one of them.
[00:37:25.424 --> 00:37:27.165]  He's doing on-the-ground research.
[00:37:27.185 --> 00:37:29.947]  He's going to be joining Alex Jones on Friday.
[00:37:30.027 --> 00:37:32.489]  So be sure to pay attention to that.
[00:37:32.589 --> 00:37:35.491]  But it's really just crazy that this is going on.
[00:37:35.971 --> 00:37:38.232]  And it just gets worse for the Democrats.
[00:37:38.493 --> 00:37:40.154]  You know, this is an old story.
[00:37:40.954 --> 00:37:57.450]  But because of the lack of news coverage, I wanted to bring it back up again today because just like the, what was it like, all the arrests that were made with the sex ring bus in California, children in cages, gets no TV coverage at all, neither does this!
[00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:05.037]  Rising young staffer for New York City's Mayor de Blasio is arrested for shocking kiddie porn involving six months old.
[00:38:05.857 --> 00:38:06.318]  Let me tell you.
[00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:11.114]  This makes you want to strangle a guy until he can't breathe anymore.
[00:38:12.595 --> 00:38:14.917]  This story is sickening.
[00:38:16.137 --> 00:38:18.519]  Thousands of pictures involving infants.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.202]  89 videos involving infants.
[00:38:23.422 --> 00:38:27.625]  Folks, this is just so disgusting.
[00:38:28.686 --> 00:38:33.309]  And this is one degree of separation away from the mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio.
[00:38:37.014 --> 00:38:41.257]  It fits right in with the Democrats this, I'm not even going to say this, filth's name.
[00:38:42.058 --> 00:38:45.161]  But one has to ask this disgusting question.
[00:38:46.161 --> 00:38:54.788]  Who is behind the camera and who is taking these pictures and who is kidnapping these children to be involved in these disgusting acts?
[00:38:55.429 --> 00:38:56.750]  There need to be hundreds of arrests.
[00:38:57.992 --> 00:38:59.573]  Immediately with this case, folks.
[00:39:00.253 --> 00:39:05.716]  And not even a blink of the eye from television news.
[00:39:05.956 --> 00:39:06.636]  But guess what?
[00:39:07.076 --> 00:39:12.659]  Mayor de Blasio, he doesn't even have to deal with any obstacles, does he?
[00:39:12.699 --> 00:39:20.142]  Because he's back, aligned with Linda Sarsour, sabotaging protests.
[00:39:21.163 --> 00:39:25.405]  Now, again, this is quite amazing.
[00:39:26.618 --> 00:39:32.640]  Because, first of all, Mayor de Blasio ought to be so ashamed of himself that he doesn't even show his face in public.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:46.845]  But now, he's stopping pro-American demonstrations in New York, and then, get this, gifting Linda Sarsour with half a million dollars!
[00:39:48.606 --> 00:39:51.827]  You know how many homeless people there are in New York that are actually citizens?
[00:39:53.493 --> 00:40:04.296]  But no, Mayor de Blasio is going to get half a million dollars to Linda Sarsour to bring in unvetted Muslims into this country because that's tolerance, that's the American way now.
[00:40:04.856 --> 00:40:07.317]  Mayor de Blasio, you are scum!
[00:40:08.398 --> 00:40:09.438]  And now I'm being polite.
[00:40:10.973 --> 00:40:15.557]  Maybe you had nothing or didn't know about that young guy who had all that child porn on your computer.
[00:40:15.597 --> 00:40:16.738]  Maybe you had nothing to do with that.
[00:40:16.778 --> 00:40:17.819]  Maybe you didn't know about that.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:21.263]  But you should know something about Linda Sarsour and giving her half a million dollars.
[00:40:21.543 --> 00:40:24.506]  Now, here's Nancy Pelosi, another Democrat.
[00:40:24.526 --> 00:40:25.987]  The Democrats are a complete disarray.
[00:40:26.267 --> 00:40:27.789]  Roll this video of Nancy Pelosi.
[00:40:29.623 --> 00:40:30.744]  Thank you, Lita Pelosi.
[00:40:30.924 --> 00:40:39.572]  I'm just wondering for your impressions of President Trump's trip so far, his first foreign trip, and if you think it's been a successful trip, and some of the messages he's been trying to deliver.
[00:40:39.632 --> 00:40:40.833]  Do I think it's a successful trip?
[00:40:41.493 --> 00:40:42.114]  Here's the thing.
[00:40:42.434 --> 00:40:48.179]  I was in like four countries, five countries, whatever, during the break.
[00:40:48.259 --> 00:40:52.683]  And during that time, if anybody said anything to me, not the heads of state, because they
[00:40:53.928 --> 00:40:55.249]  How can I twist this to be anti-Trump?
[00:40:55.269 --> 00:40:55.549]  B-b-b-b-b-b-b...
[00:41:17.728 --> 00:41:19.252]  That's not why we're here.
[00:41:20.154 --> 00:41:24.143]  Oh, now all of a sudden you don't want to criticize the president.
[00:41:25.177 --> 00:41:32.859]  Now all of a sudden you have some form of a political sportsmanship overseas, not criticizing Trump.
[00:41:32.879 --> 00:41:34.580]  But you'll call for impeachment in America.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.141]  That's not what we are here to do.
[00:41:37.881 --> 00:41:45.023]  Same thing, while he's there, we'll have some things to say about his visit.
[00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:52.645]  I have said I thought it was unusual for the President of the United States to go to Saudi Arabia first.
[00:41:53.586 --> 00:41:54.326]  Saudi Arabia?
[00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.371]  It wasn't even alphabetical.
[00:41:56.651 --> 00:41:58.753]  I mean... It wasn't even alphabetical.
[00:41:58.813 --> 00:42:00.214]  This is such a dingbat.
[00:42:00.434 --> 00:42:04.898]  She thinks presidents make their trips based on alphabetical order.
[00:42:05.579 --> 00:42:06.199]  But listen to this.
[00:42:06.339 --> 00:42:11.504]  George W. Bush and President Obama, four of them went to Canada first.
[00:42:12.505 --> 00:42:14.246]  And one of them went to Mexico.
[00:42:14.266 --> 00:42:15.948]  I'm surprised she can count to four.
[00:42:16.848 --> 00:42:17.769]  In our hemisphere.
[00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:21.893]  It didn't have to be in our hemisphere, but our friends and neighbors.
[00:42:23.578 --> 00:42:23.978]  Get it out.
[00:42:24.238 --> 00:42:27.079]  What was the decision-making process to go to Saudi Arabia?
[00:42:27.099 --> 00:42:27.879]  She's confused.
[00:42:27.899 --> 00:42:28.559]  We gotta go to break.
[00:42:28.939 --> 00:42:29.579]  She's confused.
[00:42:29.599 --> 00:42:30.079]  She doesn't know.
[00:42:30.099 --> 00:42:31.479]  Why did Trump go to Saudi Arabia?
[00:42:31.499 --> 00:42:32.040]  What's going on?
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.080]  Why did he go to Saudi Arabia?
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.800]  Are you that out of touch with reality?
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.460]  You had no idea about the arms deal?
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.201]  Or are you just keeping that under hush because you're a shareholder?
[00:42:40.601 --> 00:42:43.022]  We'll be right back with more on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:42:43.262 --> 00:42:44.482]  Oh wait, actually we've got this report.
[00:42:44.882 --> 00:42:47.942]  Go to this report from John Bowne talking about the deep state connections.
[00:42:48.202 --> 00:42:49.843]  This is a regular thing to do in government.
[00:42:49.903 --> 00:42:50.983]  Here's John Bowne breaking it down.
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.961]  Thank you, Lita Pelosi.
[00:42:54.121 --> 00:42:57.464]  I'm just wondering for your impressions of President Trump's trip so far?
[00:42:57.985 --> 00:42:58.505]  No.
[00:42:59.927 --> 00:43:01.468]  We'll have that Bowne report, I swear.
[00:43:01.488 --> 00:43:02.369]  It's coming right up.
[00:43:02.409 --> 00:43:03.850]  Thank you, Lita Pelosi.
[00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:05.872]  We've already vomited enough from Pelosi.
[00:43:08.454 --> 00:43:09.215]  Here's John Bowne.
[00:43:11.857 --> 00:43:12.778]  This is what's so frustrating.
[00:43:13.866 --> 00:43:18.736]  It is not my opinion when they say Trump gave up the nuclear sub locations that that's a lie.
[00:43:19.317 --> 00:43:22.584]  It was a press release put out by the Pentagon authorized three weeks before.
[00:43:22.805 --> 00:43:24.188]  The media buzzfeed just lies.
[00:43:25.273 --> 00:43:28.936]  It is not my opinion that Trump's not the first person to ever set up a back channel.
[00:43:29.317 --> 00:43:35.182]  Every president going back over a hundred plus years has set up back channels to Russia and England and other key countries.
[00:43:36.223 --> 00:43:39.505]  So you see the headlines with Hayden who thinks you're a moron.
[00:43:39.806 --> 00:43:45.210]  General Hayden up there out of power, an Obama lackey, saying Trump
[00:43:45.911 --> 00:43:47.892]  Has done something nobody ever did.
[00:43:47.912 --> 00:44:06.721]  It says an awful lot about us as a society that we could actually harbor those kinds of feelings that the organs of the state would be used by my predecessor to come after me or to intercept my communications or to disrupt my administration in a way that made it seem legitimate to me
[00:44:07.461 --> 00:44:07.821]  Sickening.
[00:44:39.642 --> 00:44:42.525]  And they all do it every day.
[00:44:42.645 --> 00:44:44.147]  Backchannels to Venezuela.
[00:44:44.187 --> 00:44:45.408]  Backchannels to Iran.
[00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:47.150]  Backchannels to North Korea.
[00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:48.251]  Backchannels.
[00:44:48.331 --> 00:44:49.012]  Backchannels.
[00:44:49.272 --> 00:44:52.556]  Just type in any president's name and backchannel behind it.
[00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:57.921]  Backchannels, as I understand it, and of course every administration has had it all the way, you know, forever.
[00:44:59.243 --> 00:45:02.086]  Backchannel communications with people are
[00:45:02.826 --> 00:45:07.187]  Is the CIA listening to me through my microwave oven and through my TV and through my cell phone?
[00:45:07.247 --> 00:45:09.027]  Are they doing that, sir?
[00:45:09.047 --> 00:45:09.087]  No.
[00:45:09.187 --> 00:45:11.228]  If they were, would you say yes?
[00:45:11.248 --> 00:45:11.308]  Yes.
[00:45:32.119 --> 00:45:33.199]  Is that a true answer?
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:35.400]  Yes.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.601]  Look, this... I don't believe you.
[00:45:39.561 --> 00:45:40.341]  I get that a lot.
[00:45:40.841 --> 00:45:41.781]  Yeah, yeah, okay.
[00:45:41.861 --> 00:45:43.802]  Look, you can't tell me if it's true, right?
[00:45:43.902 --> 00:45:47.683]  No, I can tell you that these tools would not be used against an American.
[00:45:47.723 --> 00:45:48.643]  We just... Why not?
[00:45:48.763 --> 00:45:50.303]  Why wouldn't they be used against an American?
[00:45:50.323 --> 00:45:52.304]  Americans are the ones who buy the Samsung TVs.
[00:45:53.164 --> 00:45:58.105]  And the head of Homeland Security has come out and said,
[00:46:00.592 --> 00:46:02.433]  But this is treason, all this leaking.
[00:46:02.873 --> 00:46:04.434]  It's totally unacceptable.
[00:46:05.314 --> 00:46:14.098]  And I don't know why people do these kind of things, but it's borderline, if not over the line of treason.
[00:46:14.399 --> 00:46:17.380]  You believe it's treason to leak some of this stuff?
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.801]  I do believe it is.
[00:46:19.261 --> 00:46:23.363]  I believe when you leak the kind of information that seems to be routinely leaked,
[00:46:23.983 --> 00:46:26.045]  They leaked all the Manchester info!
[00:46:26.085 --> 00:46:30.248]  They're trying to undermine Trump and the media then blamed Trump that his White House leaked!
[00:46:49.244 --> 00:46:54.192]  The State Department is ignoring his orders and is letting unlimited refugees in.
[00:46:54.232 --> 00:46:57.398]  That's the headline in USA Today and the New York Times.
[00:46:57.819 --> 00:46:58.460]  I read it earlier.
[00:47:00.452 --> 00:47:05.935]  I mean, Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:06.595 --> 00:47:08.176]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:08.576 --> 00:47:13.558]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:13.918 --> 00:47:19.381]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:19.761 --> 00:47:26.364]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:27.004 --> 00:47:28.145]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:29.005 --> 00:47:30.946]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:31.267 --> 00:47:34.228]  But most people are just efficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:34.669 --> 00:47:38.291]  You gotta have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:41.033]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:41.093 --> 00:47:53.441]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep-earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:53.641 --> 00:47:58.765]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities, and it's tainted.
[00:47:58.885 --> 00:48:00.387]  It's bound.
[00:48:00.507 --> 00:48:01.488]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:01.908 --> 00:48:06.492]  I tried it, and I had incredible effects, even with dirty iodine, because the body needs it.
[00:48:06.712 --> 00:48:11.616]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:12.096 --> 00:48:17.001]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:17.081 --> 00:48:18.242]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:18.402 --> 00:48:20.984]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:48:21.084 --> 00:48:21.284]  Thank you.
[00:48:43.953 --> 00:48:46.594]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:46.614 --> 00:48:47.655]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:47.975 --> 00:48:48.695]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:48.715 --> 00:48:49.335]  You must have it.
[00:48:49.695 --> 00:48:57.238]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:57.258 --> 00:48:58.119]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:58.139 --> 00:48:58.179]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.004 --> 00:49:12.070]  Well, I'm sure you've heard about Kathy Griffin and the disgusting display that she put in.
[00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:17.635]  And the first thing that I can just think of is, can you imagine what would happen if this happened?
[00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:22.553]  I don't know, seven years ago and somebody did that with an Obama head?
[00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:31.179]  Imagine the media outrage that CNN would have even though CNN does actually employ Kathy Griffin.
[00:49:31.359 --> 00:49:33.381]  It's amazing how that works.
[00:49:33.421 --> 00:49:43.768]  But it did backfire for Kathy and apparently she apologized because, you know, she's a 57-year-old woman that it took her people on Twitter to tell her that it was inappropriate what she did for her to realize it.
[00:49:44.428 --> 00:49:47.871]  But this is what I was thinking about.
[00:49:49.304 --> 00:49:54.426]  Oh yeah, and you know, this is just a twisted woman, okay?
[00:49:54.526 --> 00:50:06.069]  Her brother, unfortunately for her again, I maybe have nothing to do with it, but her brother was a pedophile, you know, so obviously maybe this family is just twisted with a woman like Kathy Griffin, that could be the case.
[00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:10.651]  But the first thing that I'm thinking of as I sit here,
[00:50:11.955 --> 00:50:22.001]  And I look at this Kathy Griffin photo with the severed Trump head with all the blood, is... Doesn't that look a lot... Everyone's saying, oh, it's ISIS, it's ISIS.
[00:50:22.041 --> 00:50:25.663]  Yeah, okay, actually, you know, that does look like an ISIS person holding a severed head.
[00:50:25.703 --> 00:50:26.584]  That is what they do.
[00:50:26.684 --> 00:50:28.725]  Of course, we know the left is aligned with ISIS.
[00:50:29.546 --> 00:50:32.387]  But let's remember Marina Abramovich.
[00:50:33.068 --> 00:50:35.129]  Remember her and her spirit cookings?
[00:50:35.529 --> 00:50:38.151]  Remember her holding up the goat's head with blood on it?
[00:50:39.113 --> 00:50:39.814]  That's right.
[00:50:40.616 --> 00:50:41.217]  That's right.
[00:50:41.337 --> 00:50:44.502]  Found in the Democrat staff emails.
[00:50:44.883 --> 00:50:45.303]  That's right.
[00:50:45.344 --> 00:50:50.432]  The Podesta is going to Spirit Cookings with Lady Gaga and then Jay-Z and all of them.
[00:50:50.452 --> 00:50:52.115]  They love Marina Abramovic.
[00:50:53.203 --> 00:51:04.751]  I'm just curious if it was Marina Abramovich that motivated Kathy Griffin to have that disgusting art display that was Trump's severed head that looked like Trump.
[00:51:04.771 --> 00:51:05.832]  That's the state of the left!
[00:51:06.673 --> 00:51:10.195]  Because they're not creative, they are vile and disgusting beings.
[00:51:10.956 --> 00:51:11.576]  There you have it.
[00:51:11.736 --> 00:51:12.557]  Kathy Griffin.
[00:51:12.977 --> 00:51:16.200]  Now you may have heard about what happened in Texas over the weekend.
[00:51:17.236 --> 00:51:22.962]  Now, before we get into the fisticuffs that flew, this was the first thing that I thought about.
[00:51:23.062 --> 00:51:26.906]  Again, it was something I thought about that nobody else really seemed to go this way.
[00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:31.319]  You had hundreds of people at the Texas Statehouse protesting.
[00:51:31.759 --> 00:51:36.520]  They were protesting, well mainly they were protesting the, I think it was SB 84 bill.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.501]  Basically, they don't like the fact that the United States has a border.
[00:51:40.881 --> 00:51:47.103]  So they're protesting Governor Abbott wanting to have strong borders and not have a sanctuary city, which is dangerous.
[00:51:47.483 --> 00:51:49.924]  So they wanted to protest the sanctuary city.
[00:51:49.944 --> 00:51:51.145]  They wanted to keep the sanctuary city.
[00:51:51.405 --> 00:51:53.866]  But they were also protesting for a number of different reasons.
[00:51:53.926 --> 00:51:55.087]  Protesting President Trump.
[00:51:55.407 --> 00:51:58.389]  I saw some people holding up the $15 minimum wage signs.
[00:51:59.209 --> 00:52:02.451]  Keep in mind, all of this protest happened on Memorial Day.
[00:52:04.741 --> 00:52:12.645]  Now they don't have that right to free speech if it wasn't for the men and women that died for the freedoms that we take for granted in this country.
[00:52:12.825 --> 00:52:15.626]  Literally laid down their life for this country.
[00:52:15.646 --> 00:52:22.650]  I know that's hard for the left to understand because they either don't have a life or don't have a soul, so they don't understand what it would mean to lay one down.
[00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:29.373]  But you have all of these people, there you can see them, they're all protesting in the beautiful Texas Capitol building.
[00:52:30.763 --> 00:52:33.929]  Not one of the liberals protesting was saluting veterans.
[00:52:34.831 --> 00:52:38.358]  Not one sign says, thank you veterans for my right to protest.
[00:52:38.518 --> 00:52:38.899]  Not one.
[00:52:39.833 --> 00:52:46.335]  Not one sign says, I want to protect the veterans in this city from illegal people that might come here and want to kill them or their kids.
[00:52:47.135 --> 00:52:47.415]  No.
[00:52:47.915 --> 00:52:49.435]  No sign supporting America.
[00:52:49.856 --> 00:52:51.196]  No sign for Memorial Day.
[00:52:51.516 --> 00:52:54.577]  No sign thanking the veterans for the freedoms that they're taking advantage of.
[00:52:54.977 --> 00:52:55.497]  Zero.
[00:52:55.737 --> 00:52:56.777]  It's all about them.
[00:52:57.017 --> 00:52:58.478]  It's all about their virtue signaling.
[00:52:58.678 --> 00:53:03.019]  It's all about their brainwashing, because that's what they're conditioned and programmed to do.
[00:53:03.419 --> 00:53:07.482]  So congratulations to all the protesters that protested on Memorial Day.
[00:53:07.863 --> 00:53:13.127]  Not one of you thanked a veteran who is responsible for giving you the freedom to protest.
[00:53:13.327 --> 00:53:14.348]  So congratulations.
[00:53:14.528 --> 00:53:24.196]  You're a bunch of selfish babies and you couldn't even thank the veterans on the day, the one day, the one day that the veterans get
[00:53:25.134 --> 00:53:35.030]  To be saluted and thanked, these selfish, liberal dumbasses wanted to protest everything else under the sun, not one of them thanked a veteran.
[00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:36.752]  You're all pathetic!
[00:53:37.614 --> 00:53:38.756]  You're all pathetic!
[00:53:40.384 --> 00:53:41.925]  I wonder how the veterans feel about you.
[00:53:42.165 --> 00:53:49.812]  You're out there protesting for non-citizens on a day that you're supposed to be saluting people that gave their life for the freedoms that you have.
[00:53:50.252 --> 00:53:52.294]  The freedoms that you're taking advantage of.
[00:53:52.614 --> 00:53:54.876]  You wouldn't be able to hold up a severed Trump head.
[00:53:55.076 --> 00:54:01.321]  You wouldn't be able to invade the courthouse protesting for non-citizens to receive benefits.
[00:54:01.582 --> 00:54:06.506]  You wouldn't get any of that if it wasn't for people who died for this country!
[00:54:08.112 --> 00:54:15.308]  It really makes my blood boil when I see these liberal protesters out there that don't even have a clue what planet they're living on.
[00:54:15.609 --> 00:54:17.653]  So then you've got the other angle of this whole thing.
[00:54:19.284 --> 00:54:28.168]  And you've got people threatening violence, lawmakers threatening violence, threatening to put a bullet in each other's heads, so now it's getting real intense between these lawmakers.
[00:54:28.208 --> 00:54:33.571]  Well, yeah, when you've got lawmakers that put non-citizens ahead of the country, guess what?
[00:54:33.851 --> 00:54:37.653]  That's treason, and in the old days, you did get a bullet in your head!
[00:54:38.153 --> 00:54:42.735]  Or you at least got challenged to a duel, not saying we should go back to those days, just saying.
[00:54:43.416 --> 00:54:45.557]  But, so, how about this angle, though?
[00:54:46.514 --> 00:54:56.098]  Then, you have some of these people that are at this protest that are proudly saying how they're non-citizen, saying, I'm an undocumented citizen, I'm not going anywhere.
[00:54:56.678 --> 00:55:01.881]  So, the lawmaker said, hmm, you know what, we'll go ahead and put that to challenge, called up ICE.
[00:55:02.541 --> 00:55:05.242]  Called up ICE because, well, that's their job.
[00:55:06.323 --> 00:55:11.645]  So this lawmaker actually did his job and then called ICE and had them do their job
[00:55:12.981 --> 00:55:13.802]  But don't you understand?
[00:55:14.302 --> 00:55:16.705]  None of this is politically correct and it's all racist.
[00:55:16.945 --> 00:55:27.316]  So on Veterans, so on Memorial Day, when we're supposed to be saluting people that died for this country, people that put their life on the line for the freedom to protest,
[00:55:28.556 --> 00:55:43.821]  They are going to protest for themselves and be selfish and say, I'm a non-citizen, I deserve all the benefits, in fact, I deserve more than a citizen, and screw anybody who died for those freedoms and the protections and the rights of Americans because, well, that's just politically incorrect.
[00:55:45.034 --> 00:55:46.295]  So, there you go.
[00:55:47.136 --> 00:55:55.522]  That's the state of the protest in America today, where if you call ICE or you want to do your job and follow the law, well, you're the bad guy.
[00:55:55.763 --> 00:56:04.910]  But if you're protesting everything under the sun, but not even thanking any of the people responsible for your ability to protest, well, then you're probably a liberal.
[00:56:06.031 --> 00:56:07.712]  Guys, let's actually get to this water story.
[00:56:07.752 --> 00:56:08.393]  So here's the deal.
[00:56:08.413 --> 00:56:10.014]  So there's all this crazy news.
[00:56:10.074 --> 00:56:11.135]  It's all this craziness.
[00:56:11.175 --> 00:56:11.976]  Everything's crazy.
[00:56:12.056 --> 00:56:12.496]  I get it.
[00:56:12.536 --> 00:56:13.417]  Trust me, I live in it.
[00:56:14.414 --> 00:56:25.156]  But there's so many basic things that we should all be behind, that we should all be paying attention to, that everybody should think is a big deal, and one of them is the water.
[00:56:26.756 --> 00:56:39.659]  Now, I just stumbled upon this report this morning, and actually, the report that I stumbled upon comes from an anti-Trump source.
[00:56:40.771 --> 00:56:51.402]  The NRDC, which fights Trump all the time, put out a story, this is actually earlier this month, widespread violations highlight need for investment in water infrastructure and protections.
[00:56:51.683 --> 00:56:53.485]  Guys, roll some of this B-roll that I have.
[00:56:54.626 --> 00:56:59.311]  So I gave the crew some B-roll to show some of these water taps.
[00:57:00.031 --> 00:57:01.153]  Let's go to that video, guys.
[00:57:03.183 --> 00:57:05.284]  And really what you have is disgusting things.
[00:57:05.324 --> 00:57:10.065]  So there's water that got drained basically from a water storage device.
[00:57:10.525 --> 00:57:14.126]  So that just goes to show you all of the crap that comes in the water.
[00:57:14.166 --> 00:57:16.467]  This was in South Texas, that black junk.
[00:57:16.507 --> 00:57:18.267]  So there's the water source.
[00:57:18.747 --> 00:57:20.748]  Gets built up with a bunch of gunk.
[00:57:21.228 --> 00:57:24.269]  So then they filter it and all that gunk goes into your tap water.
[00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:28.030]  Well, your tap water is still making contact with that gunk, you're just not seeing it.
[00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:31.151]  Okay, guys, let's go to the other one, too, with the water blowing up.
[00:57:31.191 --> 00:57:32.232]  Can we go to that one real quick?
[00:57:32.252 --> 00:57:33.273]  This is breaking this down.
[00:57:33.893 --> 00:57:35.174]  This is just your water.
[00:57:35.194 --> 00:57:37.295]  Yeah, this is just your water.
[00:57:37.315 --> 00:57:43.418]  So just, you would expect that, you know, water usually doesn't light on fire.
[00:57:43.618 --> 00:57:43.958]  Whoa!
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.440]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[00:57:48.141 --> 00:57:48.921]  What is that?
[00:57:52.423 --> 00:57:54.204]  There's your water supply, folks.
[00:57:55.004 --> 00:57:55.885]  So here's what I'm saying.
[00:57:57.057 --> 00:57:58.418]  Everybody drinks this water.
[00:57:58.478 --> 00:58:13.749]  We should all be getting behind clean water, but we're so divided by racial politics, travel ban, Trump this, Trump that, we can't even get on the same team to have healthy drinking water that doesn't explode when it's next to an open fire!
[00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:17.472]  So maybe, maybe we can do something about that, but I highly doubt it.
[00:58:17.912 --> 00:58:21.835]  Before we sign off, guys, let's actually go to Loser Hillary here.
[00:58:23.186 --> 00:58:24.587]  So actually, here's the deal with Hillary Clinton.
[00:58:24.987 --> 00:58:32.271]  She shows up again and she's wearing anti-seizure glasses at a parade, folks, because she's sick.
[00:58:32.731 --> 00:58:41.356]  This is a sick woman that had brain damage and now Hillary Clinton's team is worried that the resistance doesn't want her.
[00:58:42.217 --> 00:58:42.557]  Yes!
[00:58:42.917 --> 00:58:44.198]  Nobody wants you, Hillary!
[00:58:45.501 --> 00:58:46.402]  Nobody wants you!
[00:58:46.903 --> 00:58:53.372]  Take your brain damaged, seizure glasses, and go crawl into a hole known as your iron lung!
[00:58:54.013 --> 00:58:55.856]  That does it for the InfoWars Nightly News.
