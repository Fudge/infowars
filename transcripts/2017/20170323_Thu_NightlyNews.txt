[00:00:18.663 --> 00:00:19.444]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:21.246]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.386 --> 00:00:22.247]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:24.489]  It is Thursday, March 23rd, 2017.
[00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.072]  Here's a quick look at what's coming up.
[00:00:31.396 --> 00:00:36.160]  Tonight, President Trump and InfoWars have been accused of espionage.
[00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:42.567]  COINTEL is now coming after entire news agencies based on their political speech.
[00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:53.680]  And a terminally ill vet dying from VA neglect has an important message for President Trump on reforming the VA.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.062]  Of course it took nine hours to get seen in the emergency room, which is average for the VA.
[00:00:58.322 --> 00:01:01.944]  The doctor folds his arm, leans against the wall and just says, I don't believe you.
[00:01:02.424 --> 00:01:03.445]  You know, there's no way.
[00:01:04.305 --> 00:01:05.946]  So he and I had a bit of a discussion again.
[00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:06.707]  I left.
[00:01:07.907 --> 00:01:11.429]  At this point, I decided it was either go to a hospital and pay or die.
[00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:14.275]  Because I knew that something was really, really wrong.
[00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:16.379]  So I went to the Northeast Baptist Hospital.
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.127]  The following day I was actually diagnosed with esophageal cancer.
[00:01:20.588 --> 00:01:23.214]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.954]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:44.720]  We're making freedom go viral, and now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:04.056 --> 00:03:10.901]  President Donald Trump and Infowars, yours truly, have been accused of espionage.
[00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:19.207]  During this week's Senate hearings on Russian hacking, the usual suspects, the establishment Democrats and rogue U.S.
[00:03:19.327 --> 00:03:30.875]  intelligence heads, attempted to frame Donald Trump and Infowars for colluding with the Russians and violating the National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:03:31.838 --> 00:03:35.401]  Mr. Armstrong, you mentioned in your answer to, I think, Ms.
[00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:39.505]  Spears' question that there are other RTs operating in the U.S.
[00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:41.887]  Can you describe them, list them?
[00:03:42.147 --> 00:03:42.628]  Sure, thank you.
[00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:53.657]  So, you have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Ruppley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[00:03:54.778 --> 00:03:57.280]  InfoWars comes to mind where those are echo chambers.
[00:04:04.318 --> 00:04:07.381]  Dr. Comey, are you aware that Roger Stone played a role in the Trump campaign?
[00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:11.504]  I'm not going to talk about any particular person here today, Mr. Schiff.
[00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:20.011]  This bizarre circular thing happening where the president cites a theory that he was wiretapped, which developed on the kind of fringe right-wing media.
[00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:27.777]  And then after his tweet storm, InfoWars then started saying, well, look, it was the New York Times that reported it, citing our story, misreading our story.
[00:04:28.277 --> 00:04:33.642]  And now, a few weeks later, the White House and the president are citing InfoWars.
[00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:39.892]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
[00:04:41.073 --> 00:04:41.534]  Same answer.
[00:04:42.034 --> 00:04:47.799]  We're going to start shutting Alex Jones and others down, and we're going to sue them, and we're going to have the Justice Department come after them.
[00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:51.502]  And get this folks, if they can shut us down, you're next.
[00:04:52.284 --> 00:05:18.343]  That's right, and now investigators are busy chasing the conspiracy theory that it was far-right news organizations like Breitbart, The Drudge Report, and of course InfoWars, you know they mentioned us by name, and they accused us of assisting Russian operatives and spreading covert and illegal propaganda that helped secure the election for Donald J. Trump.
[00:05:18.834 --> 00:05:26.037]  You know, I think it's really important as we sit here that we explain this to the American people in a way that they can understand it.
[00:05:26.257 --> 00:05:27.677]  We are at war with Russia.
[00:05:28.117 --> 00:05:39.302]  So would you say that Russia engaged in hybrid warfare in its effort to undermine our democratic process and engage in our electoral process?
[00:05:39.362 --> 00:05:40.002]  Director Comey?
[00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:50.806]  They engaged in a multifaceted campaign of active measures to undermine our democracy and hurt one of the candidates and hope to help one of the other candidates.
[00:05:51.804 --> 00:05:55.507]  I actually think that their engagement was an act of war.
[00:05:55.907 --> 00:05:58.289]  You said we were attacked by Russia.
[00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:59.550]  That's not a small thing.
[00:05:59.751 --> 00:05:59.951]  Yes.
[00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:06.496]  An attack doesn't just invite a counterattack, it demands one, else you reveal your fundamental weakness and get attacked again.
[00:06:06.656 --> 00:06:10.759]  Never in the history of our elections has a country attacked us the way that Russia has.
[00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:21.048]  I think before government officials change our foreign policy and declare war against a sovereign country, as you all are attempting to do, we, citizens, have a right to know on what basis you're doing that.
[00:06:22.176 --> 00:06:33.182]  If there is objection, and I note the Senator from Kentucky on the floor, I will say before I read this, if there is objection, you are achieving the objectives of Vladimir Putin.
[00:06:33.942 --> 00:06:40.906]  You're achieving the objectives of trying to dismember this small country that has already been the subject of attempted coup.
[00:06:41.607 --> 00:06:49.191]  If they object, they are now carrying out the desires and ambitions of Vladimir Putin, and I do not say that lightly.
[00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:50.471]  Senator from Kentucky?
[00:06:50.972 --> 00:06:51.432]  I object.
[00:06:52.858 --> 00:06:53.558]  Objection is heard.
[00:06:54.138 --> 00:06:57.820]  The Senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.820]  You're carrying water for the Kremlin.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.281]  I'm not carrying water for the Kremlin.
[00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:05.742]  You're a sitting member of Congress on the Insult Committee and you can't say they hacked.
[00:07:05.962 --> 00:07:11.004]  You're going to have to move your shoulder to RT, Russian television, because this is perfectly placed.
[00:07:11.024 --> 00:07:11.944]  You know what?
[00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:15.165]  That's just so beneath your office because it's so dumb and you're being duplicitous.
[00:07:15.205 --> 00:07:17.566]  I'm asking you, did they hack Podesta's emails?
[00:07:17.686 --> 00:07:19.607]  You have no resort to personal insults like that, Tucker.
[00:07:19.627 --> 00:07:20.907]  You're filling in for Zuckerman.
[00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:25.330]  Russian scum!
[00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.034]  Our battleships weren't sunk and our towers didn't collapse a la 2011.
[00:07:30.874 --> 00:07:35.898]  But make no mistake, 2016 is a year that we should mark on our calendars.
[00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:38.440]  And it's still going on.
[00:07:39.864 --> 00:07:48.230]  The attack didn't end on election day.
[00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:58.997]  If we discover that Donald Trump or his advocates played a role in helping to devise strategy, if they're the ones who came up with Crooked Hillary,
[00:07:59.617 --> 00:08:00.358]  You know, Maxine Waters
[00:08:24.341 --> 00:08:25.582]  Is completely delusional.
[00:08:26.062 --> 00:08:32.366]  And she honestly expected that President Donald Trump would get impeached as a result of all of this.
[00:08:33.146 --> 00:08:33.266]  Right?
[00:08:33.286 --> 00:08:34.267]  I mean, it's a witch hunt.
[00:08:34.807 --> 00:08:39.350]  This is just 60 days, 60 plus days into Donald Trump's presidency.
[00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:47.615]  And they are trying to convince the American public that Trump and his staff are guilty of espionage.
[00:08:48.871 --> 00:08:58.515]  By the way, here's a list of the evidence that they have gathered that would implicate Donald Trump and his staff in Infowars for colluding with the Russians.
[00:08:58.835 --> 00:08:59.295]  You see that?
[00:09:00.056 --> 00:09:00.656]  They got nothing!
[00:09:02.423 --> 00:09:13.648]  And now it's safe to say that Trump has been vindicated for what everyone said was an outlandish claim that Barack Obama was wiretapping him.
[00:09:14.028 --> 00:09:20.711]  Because lo and behold, the House Intelligence Committee chairman was finally forced to admit it.
[00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:28.034]  So first, I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S.
[00:09:28.074 --> 00:09:30.135]  citizens involved in the Trump transition.
[00:09:31.584 --> 00:09:32.624]  Details about U.S.
[00:09:32.684 --> 00:09:44.907]  persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in intelligence community reporting.
[00:09:46.368 --> 00:09:52.229]  Third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked.
[00:09:53.717 --> 00:10:04.207]  And fourth and finally, I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or of the Trump team.
[00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:10.946]  David Knight joins us in the studio now and I want to talk about these secret, the secret cyber operation.
[00:10:10.986 --> 00:10:27.594]  We're being accused of creating bots and saturating the internet with these bots that supposedly made Hillary Clinton look bad and it helped secure the election for Donald Trump and I'm thinking if that's the case then we've got a lot of work to do.
[00:10:27.634 --> 00:10:32.496]  We're doing something wrong because California was immune to our propaganda, right?
[00:10:32.516 --> 00:10:32.937]  That's right.
[00:10:33.877 --> 00:10:36.357]  Well, they just merely put that out there and assert it as fact.
[00:10:36.658 --> 00:10:42.019]  And then based on an allegation of association, we are guilty by association.
[00:10:42.319 --> 00:10:43.339]  That's the way this thing works.
[00:10:43.939 --> 00:10:49.680]  But it goes beyond that, Darren, because we've now got the FEC taking a look at this and talking to Alex Jones.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:55.341]  Let's talk about the open secret of Hillary Clinton's bots and the fact that they were using bots.
[00:10:55.361 --> 00:11:00.162]  And we know that Facebook and Twitter and social media accounts are using bots to suppress information.
[00:11:00.902 --> 00:11:04.683]  And they're saying, oh no, you're using it to put your information out there.
[00:11:04.723 --> 00:11:07.124]  Well, everybody knows that's happening with social media.
[00:11:07.504 --> 00:11:22.629]  And it was an open secret, as a matter of fact, the organization OpenSecrets.org looked at the financing of this super PAC that was spending millions of dollars to promote Hillary online with Reddit, on Facebook, and to push back against anybody that would criticize them.
[00:11:22.669 --> 00:11:23.230]  This is a project.
[00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.650]  They had physically people on the committee.
[00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.611]  We're good to go.
[00:11:46.725 --> 00:11:48.186]  Cyber intelligence, okay?
[00:11:48.206 --> 00:11:51.228]  So what they have done is they did this with bots, they did it with humans.
[00:11:51.548 --> 00:11:56.371]  This is a project, this is a brainchild of David Brock, as that's what LA Times called it.
[00:11:56.712 --> 00:12:01.154]  They said, be nice to Hillary Clinton online or risk a confrontation with her super PAC.
[00:12:01.495 --> 00:12:06.118]  The Daily Beast was upset about it because they were using this at the time against Bernie Sanders.
[00:12:06.778 --> 00:12:10.139]  But this is the Never Trump Press that was talking about this at the time.
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.901]  Daily Beast was talking about how they were exploiting an FEC loophole.
[00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:20.203]  And this was an organization, correct the record, it is a 501c3.
[00:12:20.723 --> 00:12:23.464]  So that means that it gets tax deductible contributions.
[00:12:23.504 --> 00:12:25.885]  They should not be participating in the election this way.
[00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:28.406]  But they then set up a super PAC.
[00:12:28.766 --> 00:12:32.948]  Now the super PACs are not supposed to coordinate with the candidate, but they maintained that they could.
[00:12:33.632 --> 00:12:38.916]  Correct the Record had collected, according to Open Secrets at the time, and this is back in the primaries, they'd received $5 million.
[00:12:39.276 --> 00:12:41.497]  They had spent $4.5 million of that already.
[00:12:41.878 --> 00:12:50.904]  They say due to FEC loopholes, and I guess, Darren, the loophole is they have a law there, and then an asterisk saying, unless you are Clinton, the DNC, or other Democrats.
[00:12:50.984 --> 00:12:55.807]  So because of an FEC loophole, they could openly coordinate with the Clinton campaign.
[00:12:56.147 --> 00:13:01.210]  They said super PACs are not supposed to coordinate with them, but Correct the Record says, no, we can't do that.
[00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:03.152]  Now we've got Donna Brazile, who
[00:13:04.172 --> 00:13:11.594]  Replaced Wasserman Schultz at the DNC after the... Gave Hillary Clinton the questions ahead of time.
[00:13:11.634 --> 00:13:11.994]  That's right.
[00:13:12.034 --> 00:13:14.014]  She gave her the questions ahead of time at CNN.
[00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:22.556]  She became the DNC chair after Debbie Wasserman Schultz had resigned a disgrace because of the open corruption and hacking the election against Bernie Sanders.
[00:13:22.796 --> 00:13:23.756]  So they put Donna Brazile in.
[00:13:23.776 --> 00:13:24.777]  She's still lying about this.
[00:13:24.817 --> 00:13:26.077]  She says neither the party committee
[00:13:26.477 --> 00:13:31.400]  Nor the Clinton campaign had used bots to widen their reach of their anti-Trump message.
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.880]  Well, that simply is a lie.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.482]  And I just told you that it was an open secret that they were doing this.
[00:13:36.522 --> 00:13:37.142]  They were doing this.
[00:13:37.503 --> 00:13:39.464]  If you want to investigate this, get the IRS in here.
[00:13:39.524 --> 00:13:40.764]  Get the FEC to investigate this.
[00:13:40.784 --> 00:13:42.365]  But of course, that's not going to happen.
[00:13:42.785 --> 00:13:43.766]  I want to give an example.
[00:13:43.926 --> 00:13:44.946]  Because this is huge.
[00:13:45.006 --> 00:13:52.830]  I mean, Google was caught using algorithms to help Hillary Clinton or suppress any bad information that was out there about Hillary Clinton.
[00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.471]  And this was during the campaign.
[00:13:54.511 --> 00:13:55.552]  And I want to give you an example.
[00:13:56.332 --> 00:14:11.044]  If this was during the election, when you typed in, for example, a keyword search in Google, and you typed in Hillary Clinton is dot dot dot, the search engines attempt to complete your sentence based on common search entries.
[00:14:11.265 --> 00:14:20.612]  So, if you type in Hillary Clinton is dot dot dot, Google would respond by saying Hillary Clinton is winning, or Hillary Clinton is awesome!
[00:14:20.873 --> 00:14:21.433]  She's a winner!
[00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:22.274]  She's a winner!
[00:14:22.654 --> 00:14:29.756]  But meanwhile, at the exact same time, if you type the same sentence in Bing or Yahoo, you got totally different answers.
[00:14:29.876 --> 00:14:34.677]  Hillary Clinton is a liar, a criminal, she's evil, corrupt, a crook, a filthy liar.
[00:14:34.897 --> 00:14:40.538]  Hillary Clinton is a murderous dot dot dot, and it's all based on common search entries.
[00:14:40.839 --> 00:14:42.239]  So Google caught red-handed.
[00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:45.021]  And they did the same thing with the Clinton body count.
[00:14:45.041 --> 00:14:49.405]  Remember, during the presidential election, everybody was very interested in the Clinton body count.
[00:14:49.686 --> 00:14:50.346]  But good luck!
[00:14:50.867 --> 00:14:52.789]  If you search for it on Google, it wasn't happening.
[00:14:53.349 --> 00:15:02.818]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to vary stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:15:02.858 --> 00:15:04.580]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:15:05.222 --> 00:15:08.647]  See, what's interesting, Darren, is that they're accusing us of doing what we know they're doing.
[00:15:09.267 --> 00:15:11.851]  We have examples like you just mentioned, showing that.
[00:15:11.891 --> 00:15:18.420]  We have the LA Times, Daily Beast, talking about what they did, openly violating election laws or exploiting a loophole.
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.102]  Yet what they do against us,
[00:15:20.162 --> 00:15:24.584]  Yes, as they put out vague general allegations without any substantive proof of it.
[00:15:24.665 --> 00:15:26.345]  They don't cite any incidents of it.
[00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:32.169]  And when we look at, I think, another data point here that's very interesting is all the talk yesterday about Paul Manafort.
[00:15:32.209 --> 00:15:33.650]  Now, I don't know what his connections were.
[00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.711]  What he said was, ten years ago, he had dealings with a billionaire.
[00:15:36.731 --> 00:15:38.953]  And they said, well, that billionaire was close to Vladimir Putin.
[00:15:38.973 --> 00:15:46.537]  But why aren't they looking at John Podesta and Tony Podesta, who had much more recent ties, much more direct ties to Vladimir Putin?
[00:15:46.917 --> 00:15:50.880]  The company that Podesta was involved with, as Louie Gohmert pointed out... And the evidence is theirs!
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.881]  It's from Wikileaks!
[00:15:51.981 --> 00:15:52.462]  Exactly.
[00:15:52.562 --> 00:15:53.983]  Daily Caller had an article yesterday.
[00:15:54.063 --> 00:15:57.446]  Louie Gohmert says, look, Podesta had a role with Rosnano.
[00:15:57.846 --> 00:16:00.148]  It was a Russian state-run company.
[00:16:00.268 --> 00:16:01.850]  It was founded by Vladimir Putin.
[00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.991]  He established this relationship not ten years ago, but five years ago.
[00:16:06.431 --> 00:16:14.052]  And in 2014, when he joined the Obama administration, he failed to declare his financial interests, his stock, in that company.
[00:16:14.413 --> 00:16:15.833]  Why aren't we seeing an investigation there?
[00:16:15.873 --> 00:16:24.715]  And that's that double standard, which makes me believe that there's absolutely nothing to these Paul Manafort things, except a kind of Stalin-esque, bring me the man, I'll find the crime.
[00:16:24.975 --> 00:16:30.496]  That is what we're seeing happening with anybody that is surrounding Trump, because Trump is the center of the attack.
[00:16:30.996 --> 00:16:40.463]  But we are now in the periphery, and what they want to do is by merely alleging guilt by association, they want to try to shut down InfoWars and entire news organizations.
[00:16:40.523 --> 00:16:51.731]  This should concern people on the left as well, because if we let them get away with this, they will use these types of police state powers as kind of Stalinist, Stasi powers to come after anyone that is a political enemy.
[00:16:51.791 --> 00:16:52.472]  And believe me,
[00:16:52.992 --> 00:16:54.473]  The right will use this as well.
[00:16:54.533 --> 00:16:56.695]  You better get on board with this.
[00:16:56.855 --> 00:17:04.281]  Even if you don't agree with the politics of Donald Trump, you better not allow this type of method to be used as a coup in this country.
[00:17:04.381 --> 00:17:04.801]  That's right.
[00:17:04.841 --> 00:17:20.394]  By accusing InfoWars of colluding with a foreign entity and spreading enemy propaganda, that gives Google, Facebook, and Twitter the perfect excuse to censor everything we do and to block our content.
[00:17:20.694 --> 00:17:20.854]  Yeah.
[00:17:20.974 --> 00:17:24.877]  And once they do that, believe me, ladies and gentlemen, you're next.
[00:17:25.257 --> 00:17:31.902]  And you know, Glenn Greenwald, who absolutely doesn't agree with Donald Trump, but he has called this out for what it is from the very beginning.
[00:17:31.942 --> 00:17:32.623]  It's McCarthyism.
[00:17:32.643 --> 00:17:38.367]  A good example of it is Adam Schiff, this guy who, with the Comey hearings, is pushing this failed narrative from BuzzFeed.
[00:17:38.387 --> 00:17:40.168]  Remember the phony dossier?
[00:17:40.448 --> 00:17:44.291]  Remember the fact that we had the New York Times, Washington Post, everybody was ridiculing BuzzFeed.
[00:17:44.311 --> 00:17:46.513]  They said, well, we don't really think it's real, but
[00:17:47.293 --> 00:17:49.915]  We had an obligation to put this out there, even though we don't believe it.
[00:17:49.955 --> 00:17:52.057]  They were sued by the Russian company that was named there.
[00:17:52.077 --> 00:18:00.023]  They didn't do any more journalism on it, but now Adam Schiff just picked this up, brought it into the hearings, and Comey's, oh yeah, yeah, absolutely, let's give that credibility.
[00:18:00.403 --> 00:18:04.146]  Schiff, who goes on with Tucker Carlson, and says, you're a Russian agent.
[00:18:04.406 --> 00:18:06.366]  I mean, this is beyond ridiculous.
[00:18:06.406 --> 00:18:12.788]  We have to not allow this kind of absurd McCarthyism, red-baiting, continue.
[00:18:12.848 --> 00:18:16.309]  And people like Glenn Greenwald understand that, even though he opposes Donald Trump.
[00:18:16.709 --> 00:18:20.129]  You need to understand this, whether you agree with Trump or whether you disagree with Trump.
[00:18:20.169 --> 00:18:23.370]  We cannot allow these types of methods to go forward.
[00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:24.450]  Amen to that.
[00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.191]  David Knight, good to have you on our side.
[00:18:26.211 --> 00:18:26.591]  Thank you.
[00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:45.622]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:18:45.862 --> 00:18:48.043]  You better believe you got one!
[00:19:01.189 --> 00:19:02.710]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.697 --> 00:19:04.638]  We're good to go.
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.

[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:46.606]  Three years in the making, incredible research and the very best ingredients.
[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.531]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.832 --> 00:23:00.758]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:05.185 --> 00:23:16.190]  While millions of Americans are waiting to see if the GOP passes its version of what's being dubbed Obamacare Light, millions of veterans are waiting to see where the fate of their health care lies.
[00:23:16.591 --> 00:23:23.414]  Now that's thanks to some new wording in Paul Ryan's bill could see up to 7 million veterans ineligible.
[00:23:23.874 --> 00:23:24.195]  For now.
[00:23:39.958 --> 00:23:49.965]  On reforming the VA and putting veterans first and President Trump actually called the situation there at the VA absolutely unacceptable.
[00:23:50.025 --> 00:23:59.472]  So this could potentially be career suicide if they move forward with the language that's in this bill, forcing veterans to go to the VA before it has even been reformed.
[00:23:59.932 --> 00:24:04.393]  Now my guest today knows all too well about the situation there at the VA.
[00:24:04.473 --> 00:24:05.814]  It's Army veteran Ken Gould.
[00:24:05.894 --> 00:24:09.334]  Now he had gone to Veterans Affairs multiple times.
[00:24:10.275 --> 00:24:16.976]  There was some pretty dire symptoms and they missed the opportunity to diagnose him with esophageal cancer.
[00:24:17.016 --> 00:24:21.378]  He had to actually go to a private hospital before they were able to diagnose him.
[00:24:21.718 --> 00:24:22.418]  But by that time,
[00:24:23.078 --> 00:24:33.768]  The VA, they drug their feet so the cancer had had the opportunity to metastasize into his kidneys and liver and now the doctors have only given him about eight and a half months to live.
[00:24:34.129 --> 00:24:37.572]  Ken, thank you so much for joining us today to tell your very important story.
[00:24:37.592 --> 00:24:39.954]  Thank you for having me.
[00:24:39.994 --> 00:24:40.575]  I appreciate being on.
[00:24:41.836 --> 00:24:45.920]  So tell us where kind of this, give us a little background and where your story sort of begins.
[00:24:47.847 --> 00:24:49.507]  Well, obviously I joined the military.
[00:24:49.808 --> 00:24:53.689]  I did my eight years honorably discharged about four months ago.
[00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:59.870]  Around August, I started having symptoms, getting sick once in a while, things like that.
[00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:01.051]  It was a meal a day.
[00:25:01.071 --> 00:25:04.011]  It was once a week, twice a week, and then it kind of progressed.
[00:25:04.772 --> 00:25:07.292]  I just thought it's maybe it was some, I don't know.
[00:25:07.392 --> 00:25:09.233]  I was just not sure what it was.
[00:25:09.313 --> 00:25:14.114]  And I basically myself didn't go to the VA until November.
[00:25:14.774 --> 00:25:17.195]  In November, I visited an emergency room.
[00:25:17.999 --> 00:25:19.319]  The gentleman asked me why I was there.
[00:25:19.379 --> 00:25:24.800]  Basically, he told me that I didn't need to be there, so I had to call my primary care doctor.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.240]  They set you an appointment.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.661]  Well, it took a month to get an appointment there.
[00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:28.521]  So I go there.
[00:25:30.001 --> 00:25:33.662]  Basically, the doctor tells me, you have acid reflux.
[00:25:34.002 --> 00:25:36.142]  Well, I explained to him, I don't have that.
[00:25:36.342 --> 00:25:36.722]  I can't.
[00:25:37.322 --> 00:25:38.763]  It's not that I'm having acid reflux.
[00:25:38.803 --> 00:25:39.363]  I can't eat.
[00:25:39.743 --> 00:25:40.743]  And things just come up.
[00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:43.483]  And he says, well, I'm going to give you pills.
[00:25:43.824 --> 00:25:45.704]  And then I explained, I can't swallow pills.
[00:25:46.964 --> 00:25:48.426]  So there you have that.
[00:25:48.666 --> 00:25:57.093]  So I went back home, still continued to get sick, and actually progressively got worse to where I wasn't eating but once a week, twice a week.
[00:25:57.634 --> 00:25:59.075]  I could keep some water down at that time.
[00:25:59.684 --> 00:26:07.647]  Through that time, I went and visited the VA, Audie Murphy Hospital, three different times, one a Friday, Saturday, and then a Sunday, consecutively.
[00:26:08.407 --> 00:26:12.428]  What I did was about on the 13th of the month of January, it took this long.
[00:26:13.348 --> 00:26:15.609]  I went in and they did my blood work.
[00:26:15.989 --> 00:26:21.791]  Of course, it took nine hours to get seen in the emergency room, which is average for the VA, it seems like right now.
[00:26:21.811 --> 00:26:25.592]  They took me into my blood work, said, hey, your blood work's great.
[00:26:26.052 --> 00:26:27.613]  Your kidneys look fine, your liver.
[00:26:28.206 --> 00:26:29.367]  Blood, everything seems great.
[00:26:29.707 --> 00:26:30.808]  We really can't help you."
[00:26:30.828 --> 00:26:32.088]  I was like, well, I can't eat.
[00:26:32.108 --> 00:26:34.490]  He's like, well, I don't, you know, I don't see how that's possible.
[00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.391]  So after we had a discussion, I left.
[00:26:38.392 --> 00:26:41.234]  Basically went another week, hadn't eaten now.
[00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:44.596]  By that week, I had been almost two weeks since I had an actual meal.
[00:26:45.376 --> 00:26:50.079]  And yes, it is hard to believe that, but went back in again, same scenario.
[00:26:50.731 --> 00:26:53.133]  Got told again, hey, we don't understand, your blood's fine.
[00:26:53.173 --> 00:26:59.158]  And really, even at this point, the guy actually folds, doctor folds his arm, leans against the wall and just says, I don't believe you.
[00:26:59.178 --> 00:27:00.679]  You know, there's no way.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.181]  So he and I had a bit of a discussion again.
[00:27:03.201 --> 00:27:03.962]  I left.
[00:27:04.583 --> 00:27:05.343]  Came back a week later.
[00:27:06.104 --> 00:27:11.348]  This time now I was not only getting sick, but I was actually vomiting blood.
[00:27:11.989 --> 00:27:14.311]  So I figured for sure the VA has got to do something for me.
[00:27:14.351 --> 00:27:14.911]  There's no way.
[00:27:15.332 --> 00:27:16.333]  This has got to be my way in.
[00:27:16.693 --> 00:27:17.754]  And once again,
[00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:22.128]  All I got talked to about was a prior condition I had.
[00:27:22.148 --> 00:27:23.708]  It had nothing to do with this.
[00:27:24.988 --> 00:27:26.608]  Said he didn't understand why.
[00:27:26.929 --> 00:27:31.169]  He said basically I needed to get a scope and see an oncologist, but there's nothing they could do for me today.
[00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:35.710]  So I just have to come back next week sometime and set up an appointment and see what they can do for me.
[00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.530]  So at that point, went home.
[00:27:39.651 --> 00:27:43.412]  Basically couldn't get out of bed hardly anymore.
[00:27:44.272 --> 00:27:45.992]  Hadn't eaten now for three weeks.
[00:27:47.335 --> 00:27:53.741]  At this point, I decided it was either go to a hospital and pay or die because I knew that something was really, really wrong.
[00:27:53.901 --> 00:27:57.123]  So I went to the Northeast Baptist Hospital in San Antonio.
[00:27:57.443 --> 00:28:00.146]  Within an hour of being there, they had me in the emergency room.
[00:28:00.586 --> 00:28:02.467]  I said, hey, I showed them what was going on.
[00:28:02.507 --> 00:28:05.550]  I basically had a demo to get anybody to understand.
[00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.091]  He's like, man, you know, you're really sick.
[00:28:07.111 --> 00:28:07.852]  Let's get you upstairs.
[00:28:08.332 --> 00:28:10.694]  Next morning, the doctors did a scope.
[00:28:11.537 --> 00:28:19.662]  The following day, I was actually diagnosed with esophageal cancer, and at that point, the doctor said, there's no way you could have eaten or drank anything.
[00:28:19.742 --> 00:28:24.045]  Your esophageal tube, basically, to your stomach is closed.
[00:28:24.325 --> 00:28:25.806]  There's no way anything could get through there.
[00:28:25.946 --> 00:28:27.708]  So, we're going to take care of you.
[00:28:28.608 --> 00:28:39.515]  At that point, the doctor, and I get a little emotional, basically saved my life at that point, so I could eat again, and it was awesome.
[00:28:41.007 --> 00:28:43.688]  At that point, I stayed there for about a week or so.
[00:28:43.808 --> 00:28:44.508]  They took care of me.
[00:28:44.688 --> 00:28:46.548]  I gained about eight pounds that week.
[00:28:46.888 --> 00:28:48.989]  And what I did was I waited.
[00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:50.549]  I called the VA and told them what was going on.
[00:28:50.569 --> 00:28:54.810]  The hospital actually got in contact with the VA as well and said, look, you know, you have a soldier here that needs to be taken care of.
[00:28:55.571 --> 00:28:56.291]  So they said, okay.
[00:28:56.311 --> 00:28:56.931]  So they called me.
[00:28:57.271 --> 00:29:00.952]  I got home and I got a call from the VA saying, we're going to set you an appointment with an oncologist.
[00:29:01.472 --> 00:29:03.353]  They said about three days, five days to get you an appointment.
[00:29:03.453 --> 00:29:04.733]  Well, seven, eight days go by.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.480]  So, I hear nothing.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.921]  So, finally, I said, you know what, I'm just going to go to the hospital.
[00:29:08.941 --> 00:29:10.041]  So, I went to the emergency room again.
[00:29:10.601 --> 00:29:18.203]  Last time, with all the paperwork, all the documentation and pictures of my esophagus, walked in and said, here you go.
[00:29:18.343 --> 00:29:20.084]  Now, let's do something about this.
[00:29:20.564 --> 00:29:25.965]  And they actually, at this point, wow, they realized that I had esophageal cancer and that I was terminal.
[00:29:26.505 --> 00:29:29.666]  So, from there, they took me to the hospital.
[00:29:30.495 --> 00:29:50.900]  Wow, and of course your story is, I feel like a lot of people out there will be very familiar with your story and you really wanted to tell this story because you've met people that have these same symptoms and then they get turned away and then of course if they don't have, you know, if it's not so dire that they don't decide to just go get some treatment they might have to pay for, well then it might be a little bit too late for them.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.021]  I know you were telling me that this private hospital actually
[00:29:54.361 --> 00:29:57.542]  Well, what I want to see is I want to see other veterans step up and fight for your own care.
[00:29:57.622 --> 00:30:00.202]  If you don't step up and fight for yourself, they're not going to, you know, they
[00:30:23.629 --> 00:30:25.170]  They have their own plan when you get there.
[00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:30.352]  It seems to me that they don't listen to us at all when we tell them what's wrong with you.
[00:30:30.392 --> 00:30:34.954]  I've explained every time I went in what was going on and I begged them to help me and I didn't get any help.
[00:30:35.374 --> 00:30:39.416]  What I want to see is a little more caring, just like at the private hospital.
[00:30:39.456 --> 00:30:44.238]  I mean, it's amazing to me, you can go to a private hospital and get treated better than anywhere else.
[00:30:44.278 --> 00:30:50.101]  And I keep hearing the VA is the best, you know, we're going to do this for everybody and we're going to take care of the veterans and the ones that are far from our country.
[00:30:50.748 --> 00:30:53.510]  We still get treated like second class citizens.
[00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.653]  We don't, we never get help unless you're fighting.
[00:30:56.673 --> 00:31:05.821]  I mean, you have to fight them to get in there and they just ignore your symptoms and try to treat you with all these different pills, you know, and I don't, I don't believe in that.
[00:31:05.841 --> 00:31:17.531]  And people need to hear us and we all need to stand up and fight for ourselves because way too many people, you know, I've met a guy, I went to the actual, my primary care doctor and was talking to the guy behind the counter that was taking my information and I told him what was going on.
[00:31:17.551 --> 00:31:18.612]  He goes, you know, I have the same problem.
[00:31:19.341 --> 00:31:20.061]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:31:34.454 --> 00:31:34.674]  Right.
[00:31:35.375 --> 00:31:42.519]  Well, we just have about a minute and a half left, and I really wanted to draw people's attention to a GoFundMe page that your daughter has actually set up.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.162]  You know, you have been diagnosed with this terminal cancer.
[00:31:46.202 --> 00:31:49.904]  Your daughter doesn't have much time left with you.
[00:31:49.924 --> 00:31:51.445]  Sorry, it's hurting me.
[00:31:51.465 --> 00:31:57.169]  So I know she wants to help you achieve as much on your bucket list as possible.
[00:31:57.189 --> 00:31:59.411]  The two of you are going to take this trip together.
[00:32:00.692 --> 00:32:04.254]  Tell us a little bit about what's on this bucket list and where people can go to donate.
[00:32:06.176 --> 00:32:08.157]  Well, if you follow that link, you'll go and see our page.
[00:32:08.518 --> 00:32:13.021]  They can follow me and my journey through chemotherapy and those types of things.
[00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:15.223]  And also, you know, we put on there the trips we take.
[00:32:15.724 --> 00:32:22.630]  Right now, they're little trips because that's really all I can really afford to do, you know, which is, you know, it is what it is, but this is a special time for us.
[00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:24.191]  I don't have much longer left.
[00:32:26.593 --> 00:32:26.793]  Yes.
[00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.141]  I know, and you've already had some success there.
[00:32:31.161 --> 00:32:40.864]  It looks like you're about $3,000 toward that $10,000 goal, so I hope everyone out there that's watching this, just help them get to that goal as fast as possible.
[00:32:41.484 --> 00:32:45.385]  And Ken, thank you so much for telling your story, and for your daughter.
[00:32:46.186 --> 00:32:49.667]  My heart goes out to you all, and putting your story out there.
[00:32:49.827 --> 00:32:50.927]  Veterans do need to be heard.
[00:32:52.408 --> 00:32:52.948]  Thank you, ma'am.
[00:32:52.968 --> 00:32:53.728]  I do appreciate everything.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.436]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.857]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.877 --> 00:36:50.857]  $200.
[00:36:51.457 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:05.669 --> 00:37:13.054]  An Islamic terrorist mowed down numerous victims in a car before stabbing a police officer and trying to attack the Parliament in London.
[00:37:13.134 --> 00:37:14.895]  And how did the left respond?
[00:37:14.955 --> 00:37:16.636]  By expressing their concerns.
[00:37:16.836 --> 00:37:20.739]  Not for the victims, but for how it might make Muslims look bad.
[00:37:20.939 --> 00:37:23.640]  In moments, Donald Trump will begin exploiting the attack in London today.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.641]  Do not allow this to be an indictment on Islam or Muslims.
[00:37:26.761 --> 00:37:32.522]  Far-right figures like Tommy Robinson are vile opportunists, using victims of today's attack to spread their anti-Muslim message.
[00:37:32.602 --> 00:37:40.885]  That's right, some members of the media were more upset that Tommy Robinson had showed up to the scene of the attack than the attack itself.
[00:37:40.985 --> 00:37:44.006]  But at least London Mayor Sadiq Khan was quick to respond.
[00:37:44.548 --> 00:37:48.052]  Oh no, that's right, it took him more than five hours to appear on camera.
[00:37:48.072 --> 00:37:50.895]  Trump's ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe.
[00:37:51.015 --> 00:37:52.897]  It risks alienating mainstream Muslims.
[00:37:53.258 --> 00:37:55.000]  London has proved him wrong!
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.662]  Yeah, that tweet hasn't aged well, has it?
[00:37:57.682 --> 00:38:01.487]  But at least none of them were stupid enough to blame Donald Trump, right?
[00:38:01.527 --> 00:38:03.449]  Trump probably has a hand in this!
[00:38:03.869 --> 00:38:10.951]  Yeah, okay, but it's important to remember that hashtag not all Muslims are terrorists and that Muslims don't support this.
[00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:14.852]  Here's a screenshot from France 24 Arabic's live video feed.
[00:38:15.072 --> 00:38:17.693]  Note the smiley faces and the thumbs up.
[00:38:17.793 --> 00:38:23.394]  They're saying quote, God curse the infidels and quote, that's how the lone wolves of Allah operate.
[00:38:23.514 --> 00:38:25.835]  Here's a screenshot from Al Jazeera Live.
[00:38:25.975 --> 00:38:29.236]  I'm watching Al Jazeera Live, you wouldn't believe the number of likes.
[00:38:29.436 --> 00:38:31.456]  Well done and Allah Akbar.
[00:38:31.516 --> 00:38:33.577]  Here's a moderate Muslim perspective.
[00:38:33.717 --> 00:38:36.559]  I'm seeing rumblings that what's going on in London is an attack from radical Islam.
[00:38:36.719 --> 00:38:38.801]  If so, there was likely good reason for it!
[00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:41.243]  But hashtag not all Muslims, right?
[00:38:41.383 --> 00:38:44.805]  These cowardly bastards can maim, murder and terrorise all they like, but they'll never win.
[00:38:44.965 --> 00:38:51.430]  If by winning, you mean changing society, then they are winning, with the full complicity of the left.
[00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:56.474]  Canada is currently debating a motion that will effectively criminalise Islamophobia.
[00:38:56.714 --> 00:38:58.716]  In other words, criticism of Islam.
[00:38:58.996 --> 00:39:04.080]  Just three years after their own parliament was also attacked by an Islamic terrorist.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.161]  They are winning.
[00:39:05.281 --> 00:39:08.223]  And our governments are helping this ideology to spread.
[00:39:08.484 --> 00:39:09.825]  They're welcoming it in.
[00:39:09.885 --> 00:39:13.428]  We're erecting glass walls around the frigging Eiffel Tower.
[00:39:13.788 --> 00:39:18.332]  Sweden just allowed 150 ISIS terrorists back into their country.
[00:39:18.432 --> 00:39:22.715]  Oh, but don't worry because they set up a phone hotline for people to report them.
[00:39:22.815 --> 00:39:24.957]  And then closed it down because it might be racist.
[00:39:25.177 --> 00:39:34.121]  Now we have the Islamist Erdogan threatening to send Muslim migrants with the vow that Europeans won't be able to walk safely on the streets.
[00:39:34.361 --> 00:39:41.024]  France just polled young Muslims and found that a third of them, a third, expressed sympathy for terrorism.
[00:39:41.104 --> 00:39:43.025]  Here are a few questions that spring to mind.
[00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:51.049]  Why are Brits being arrested for tweets while Islamists are free to walk around Parliament draped in the ISIS flag?
[00:39:51.189 --> 00:39:55.292]  Why do we have a mayor who calls moderate Muslims Uncle Toms?
[00:39:55.472 --> 00:40:00.396]  A mayor who says terrorist attacks are part and parcel of living in a major city?
[00:40:00.496 --> 00:40:03.098]  And I'm sick to the back teeth of saying it.
[00:40:03.338 --> 00:40:04.880]  But I'll say it again.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.582]  Pray for hashtags won't prevent this.
[00:40:07.722 --> 00:40:11.084]  Turning off the lights at the Eiffel Tower won't prevent this.
[00:40:11.264 --> 00:40:15.588]  Putting a filter on your Facebook profile pic won't prevent this.
[00:40:15.868 --> 00:40:22.294]  Sticking your head in the sand and pointing the finger at right-wingers will not prevent this.
[00:40:22.494 --> 00:40:28.960]  And whether this terrorist turns out to be homegrown or a migrant or whatever, the belief system is the same.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:37.047]  Acknowledging that Islam is not a religion of peace and is in serious need of imminent reform will prevent this.
[00:40:37.307 --> 00:40:42.430]  So don't intimidate and attack the Muslim reformists who are trying to make that happen.
[00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:52.514]  Not rolling out a red carpet into our country to be exploited by terrorists as they've done over and over again will prevent this.
[00:40:52.755 --> 00:40:59.458]  How many more mangled bodies on our streets will it take before that happens?
[00:41:03.593 --> 00:41:08.134]  It has been a marathon of vicious questioning by the Democratic Party.
[00:41:08.314 --> 00:41:12.435]  Do you recall what I said or who I said was the elephant in the room?
[00:41:13.655 --> 00:41:15.895]  I'm sorry, Senator, I don't.
[00:41:16.115 --> 00:41:17.956]  I apologize sincerely.
[00:41:18.396 --> 00:41:19.696]  I'll refresh your recollection.
[00:41:19.876 --> 00:41:23.237]  The initials are D-J-T.
[00:41:23.857 --> 00:41:29.038]  What do you think the President meant when he used the words so-called judge?
[00:41:30.532 --> 00:41:32.494]  Senator, I don't know what was in his mind.
[00:41:32.734 --> 00:41:33.895]  You'd have to ask him.
[00:41:34.495 --> 00:41:45.943]  Why, in your early decision, did you want to lower the bar so low to merely more than de minimis as a standard for public education to meet this federal requirement under the law?
[00:41:46.624 --> 00:41:54.870]  If anyone is suggesting that I like a result where an autistic child happens to lose, that's a heartbreaking accusation to me.
[00:41:55.651 --> 00:41:56.131]  Heartbreaking.
[00:41:57.498 --> 00:42:01.881]  The fact of the matter is I was bound by circuit precedent and so was the panel of my court.
[00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:20.953]  It is absurd to say this company is in its rights to fire him because he made the choice of possibly dying from freezing to death or causing other people to die possibly by driving an unsafe vehicle.
[00:42:21.213 --> 00:42:22.034]  That's absurd.
[00:42:23.069 --> 00:42:27.973]  Now, I had a career in identifying absurdity.
[00:42:30.775 --> 00:42:32.236]  And I know it when I see it.
[00:42:32.916 --> 00:42:36.839]  As a lawyer, they are people that are so reverent in the law.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.361]  And Al Franken is not going to wedge this guy.
[00:42:39.421 --> 00:42:47.307]  And again, they're trying to show, because he wrote a dissent in favor of the employer, that he is pro-employer and against the employee.
[00:42:47.427 --> 00:42:49.609]  And that's the absurdity of Al Franken's question.
[00:42:49.949 --> 00:42:56.978]  Would the president have the authority to ban all Jews from the United States, or all people that come from Israel?
[00:42:57.438 --> 00:42:59.321]  Senator... Would that be an easy question?
[00:42:59.621 --> 00:43:03.886]  We have a constitution, and it does guarantee free exercise.
[00:43:04.207 --> 00:43:07.371]  It also guarantees equal protection of the laws.
[00:43:07.907 --> 00:43:12.529]  This congressman wants you on the court so they can uphold a Muslim ban.
[00:43:12.569 --> 00:43:17.111]  Senator, he has no idea how I'd rule in that case.
[00:43:17.551 --> 00:43:18.792]  Vote nay on Gorsuch.
[00:43:19.172 --> 00:43:21.593]  Demand the 60 votes and don't give them to Trump.
[00:43:21.913 --> 00:43:23.154]  It's not this guy's turn.
[00:43:23.214 --> 00:43:24.354]  It's not his guy's turn.
[00:43:24.595 --> 00:43:28.336]  And all the charm and dancing and Mr. Nice Guy is not going to change it.
[00:43:28.496 --> 00:43:34.219]  But what is truly lurking in the closet of the Democratic Party and its shadow government overlords?
[00:43:34.719 --> 00:43:54.328]  Considering the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the originalist Supreme Court seat vacated due to the mysterious death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Presidio County Judge Cinderella Guevara pronounced Scalia dead due to natural causes without seeing the body or even ordering an autopsy.
[00:43:54.648 --> 00:43:59.450]  If you believe that, we ought to go back to monarchy, that the people are such sheep.
[00:44:00.578 --> 00:44:05.501]  That they just swallow whatever they see on television or read in the newspapers?
[00:44:05.822 --> 00:44:14.247]  Any signs of strangulation uncovered by a mandatory standard autopsy, such as patechial hemorrhage, would have sounded off alarm bells.
[00:44:14.468 --> 00:44:19.771]  Yet an autopsy of one of the most powerful people in the United States was neglected.
[00:44:20.111 --> 00:44:27.797]  Meanwhile, towns like Falfurious, Texas shell out money they don't have to perform autopsies on illegal aliens.
[00:44:28.397 --> 00:44:37.242]  Earlier today, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer led the stampede of scorn, declaring that he would filibuster the confirmation.
[00:44:37.462 --> 00:44:45.507]  After careful deliberation, I have concluded that I cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court.
[00:44:45.947 --> 00:44:55.933]  First, Judge Gorsuch was unable to sufficiently convince me that he'd be an independent check on a president who has shown almost no restraint
[00:44:56.923 --> 00:44:58.304]  From Executive Overreach.
[00:44:59.344 --> 00:45:05.767]  And finally, he is someone who almost instinctively favors the powerful over the weak.
[00:45:06.828 --> 00:45:08.948]  Corporations over working Americans.
[00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:13.891]  There could not be a worse time for someone with those instincts.
[00:45:14.718 --> 00:45:16.258]  Unfortunately, you've grown up
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:47.906]  Hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[00:45:48.246 --> 00:45:50.468]  It's time to stop submitting to this tyranny!
[00:45:50.488 --> 00:45:52.729]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:56.152]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[00:45:57.673 --> 00:46:00.375]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[00:46:00.535 --> 00:46:04.117]  Tyranny with a capital T. You should reject these voices.
[00:46:04.918 --> 00:46:06.219]  Everything that's been done
[00:46:07.418 --> 00:46:23.930]  With torture, rendition, the NDAA, the Patriot Acts 1 and 2, from day one, was focused on the American people, period.
[00:46:25.331 --> 00:46:25.752]  That's it.
[00:46:26.903 --> 00:46:35.431]  It's always been about erasing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and rolling out NSA spying publicly, saying it's for Al Qaeda.
[00:46:35.851 --> 00:46:39.955]  Rolling out torture, saying it's for Al Qaeda, but it's really for the general public.
[00:46:40.295 --> 00:46:48.883]  Rolling out total control and the end of any underground free market systems in the name of fighting Al Qaeda, but really shutting down any type of free commerce.
[00:46:49.344 --> 00:46:51.326]  This is all about converting us
[00:46:51.846 --> 00:47:07.737]  From a free society to a tyranny with a capital T. Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.848]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.028 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.328]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:04.169]  I tried it.
[00:48:04.749 --> 00:48:08.309]  And I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.430]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:18.811]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.891 --> 00:48:20.051]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:22.792]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:48:22.952 --> 00:48:23.172]  Of course!
[00:48:45.794 --> 00:48:48.416]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.436 --> 00:48:49.476]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.817 --> 00:48:50.497]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.537 --> 00:48:51.158]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.518 --> 00:48:59.063]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.083 --> 00:48:59.963]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.983 --> 00:49:00.024]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:07.168 --> 00:49:10.590]  You know, I was just talking to Dr. Nick Begich, who I've just met for the first time.
[00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:15.352]  I've been interviewing him for about 20 years, and he's a best-selling author.
[00:49:15.372 --> 00:49:25.196]  Of course, his father was a famous reformer and congressman who was killed in a plane crash, clearly by foul play, Dr. Begich believes.
[00:49:25.236 --> 00:49:27.397]  I think it's clear his brother obviously was just an outgoing
[00:49:28.257 --> 00:49:28.657]  Yes, we're good.
[00:49:50.373 --> 00:50:06.074]  What globalism is, as a breakaway civilization, what this challenge of nation-states is to this system, and then if we're just now having them admit that, okay, your TV and your toaster are, you know, watching and listening to you, what else is going on?
[00:50:07.332 --> 00:50:11.157]  Well, baggage was talking about that again 20 years ago, and now here it is.
[00:50:11.257 --> 00:50:14.261]  And I didn't just have baggage as a source, I had NSA whistleblowers, you name it.
[00:50:14.782 --> 00:50:18.868]  And I was like a mainline Republican, kind of Libertarian, when I first got on air 22 years ago.
[00:50:18.908 --> 00:50:23.754]  I knew some stuff, but I just, it was my listeners that were actually informed, and my guests.
[00:50:24.847 --> 00:50:26.628]  And here we are.
[00:50:26.648 --> 00:50:30.170]  So he's with us a little bit in the next hour, and then we're going to hopefully get him down to South by Southwest.
[00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:36.514]  And so I was thinking of having you, you know, go down as like, you know, the expert on the technocracy and just look how they're selling it down there.
[00:50:36.554 --> 00:50:39.276]  But I know you've already been there, so perhaps you can speak some to that.
[00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:50.243]  But really just prefacing this, most folks know who you are, obviously, and with your EarthPulse.com and the great organization you run, trying to inform people how you expose the Tesla technologies that the FBI seized.
[00:50:51.451 --> 00:50:58.933]  Harp, The Betrayal of Science and Society and the Soul, your Earth Rising series, your Mind Control book.
[00:50:59.694 --> 00:51:01.014]  You go off what's admitted.
[00:51:01.394 --> 00:51:04.035]  And again, it's way beyond what we even see in the news today.
[00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:09.096]  But I just want the right-wing people to understand, the left-wing people to understand everybody.
[00:51:10.597 --> 00:51:14.038]  It's all about making you think you're part of the system or you're part of some winning group.
[00:51:15.455 --> 00:51:24.221]  When you buy into the whole control paradigm, there's no doubt that you're not part of the elite, that there's only a few hundred of these people, and they're not even winners either.
[00:51:24.261 --> 00:51:25.302]  They're psychopaths, basically.
[00:51:26.002 --> 00:51:26.622]  That's my opinion.
[00:51:26.642 --> 00:51:28.063]  We'll get yours, and we'll give you the floor in a moment.
[00:51:29.344 --> 00:51:33.947]  But that's really what's so frustrating to me, is they believe they're ugly.
[00:51:34.708 --> 00:51:37.329]  They're projecting their hatred on the general public.
[00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:40.792]  They're setting up cultural systems to make us ugly and dumb, and it's working.
[00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:43.712]  But it feeds back and only makes them worse.
[00:51:43.893 --> 00:51:46.655]  And some elites are recognizing this.
[00:51:46.735 --> 00:51:50.998]  Because at the level I've gotten, I've pretty much talked to you name it.
[00:51:51.339 --> 00:51:52.059]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.862]  And even a lot of their own people are freaked out.
[00:51:54.882 --> 00:51:58.945]  Their wives and their husbands are freaked out at the people that are right next to the highest level.
[00:51:59.786 --> 00:52:03.229]  They claim there's a 6,000 group, a super class that manages things.
[00:52:03.249 --> 00:52:04.730]  I was been offered to be part of that.
[00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.911]  But that's the gophers.
[00:52:05.971 --> 00:52:06.972]  There's 6,000 gophers.
[00:52:07.232 --> 00:52:07.772]  There's only
[00:52:08.703 --> 00:52:13.405]  Few hundred people at the top that are managing this thing, and it's the darkest, most evil thing.
[00:52:13.425 --> 00:52:15.866]  I also want to talk about today, the heart of it.
[00:52:15.967 --> 00:52:16.967]  Maybe we should start at the end.
[00:52:17.287 --> 00:52:19.188]  Where are they taking us from your deep research?
[00:52:19.568 --> 00:52:20.789]  Where is it going, Dr. Begich?
[00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:25.571]  Because I know you like to only show people what's going on, let them make their own conclusion.
[00:52:25.891 --> 00:52:26.752]  We've talked privately.
[00:52:27.592 --> 00:52:30.373]  Maybe we should start at the end and then go back to the beginning.
[00:52:31.034 --> 00:52:31.854]  What governs it?
[00:52:32.314 --> 00:52:32.914]  What is it?
[00:52:33.074 --> 00:52:34.615]  We know it's taking us somewhere bad.
[00:52:34.655 --> 00:52:35.275]  It admits it.
[00:52:35.696 --> 00:52:37.236]  It says it's a post-human world.
[00:52:37.656 --> 00:52:38.417]  What are we facing?
[00:52:38.477 --> 00:52:39.717]  It's great to have Dr. Nick Baggage.
[00:52:39.737 --> 00:52:53.563]  I'm not going to go into all of his degrees and all the things he's been involved in, all the things that, you know, all over the world and also representing Native tribes successfully to get them major concessions and oil and gas, you name it, a true Robin Hood for the people.
[00:52:54.163 --> 00:52:55.124]  So it's great to have you here, my friend.
[00:52:55.464 --> 00:52:58.045]  Thank you very much, and it's my pleasure to be here with you, Alex.
[00:52:58.125 --> 00:53:01.526]  It's, you know, 20 years of working together and finally we get to see each other.
[00:53:02.006 --> 00:53:03.126]  And this is a tough time.
[00:53:03.626 --> 00:53:09.568]  And I wanted to come down, meet you in Austin, and show my support for you.
[00:53:09.588 --> 00:53:14.169]  And encourage listeners, you know, the alternative news is the only real news.
[00:53:14.773 --> 00:53:16.894]  And Alex, you've been at this as long as I have.
[00:53:16.934 --> 00:53:18.235]  We started around the same time.
[00:53:18.955 --> 00:53:21.296]  And it is time to wake up, America.
[00:53:21.316 --> 00:53:28.760]  It's time to recognize that the support that people like Alex need right now is critical to retaining the republic.
[00:53:29.361 --> 00:53:36.244]  And there's a lot of issues out there, but the most pressing issues right now have now come into the forefront.
[00:53:36.304 --> 00:53:41.327]  Twenty years of talking about personal privacy and liberty being stripped away from us a slice at a time.
[00:53:41.967 --> 00:53:49.235]  And here we are in 2017 at the threshold of big changes and the left is panicked.
[00:53:49.815 --> 00:53:51.757]  They're panicked because the agenda is over.
[00:53:52.518 --> 00:53:54.981]  The game is up and people are waking up.
[00:53:56.462 --> 00:54:00.487]  Again, I'm going to try to interrupt because if I do, we know where that goes.
[00:54:02.392 --> 00:54:07.215]  If I had 10 extra crew members, I would have them chronicle everything you say, I say, other people say.
[00:54:07.756 --> 00:54:12.399]  I remembered you 15 years ago saying, Alex, things are going to get bad, but they're going to get better.
[00:54:13.079 --> 00:54:19.844]  By sometime around before 2020, we're predicting a mass awakening, and the elite are scared of these massive human potentials.
[00:54:19.864 --> 00:54:29.510]  I know you can't get into a lot of it because you've talked to some groups and some of the elite and some classified stuff, but there are groups in the elite that actually want to empower humanity, but the big dominant group is wanting to suppress it.
[00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:30.091]  I'm getting chills.
[00:54:30.931 --> 00:54:31.331]  I know.
[00:54:31.411 --> 00:54:33.172]  Trump is a true attempted breakthrough.
[00:54:33.192 --> 00:54:36.334]  That's what he said in his statement at his inaugural.
[00:54:36.354 --> 00:54:37.374]  There's life extension.
[00:54:37.614 --> 00:54:38.895]  We're about to unlock the keys.
[00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:40.676]  They know the keys are already being unlocked.
[00:54:41.096 --> 00:54:42.517]  Trump wants to transfer that to people.
[00:54:42.537 --> 00:54:43.137]  I'm getting chills.
[00:54:43.758 --> 00:54:50.241]  But how did you predict that, at least 15 years ago, that around this time this would be the big battle?
[00:54:50.581 --> 00:55:00.146]  Well, you know, going back to the beginning of the work, it was in the mid-90s, and when we started looking at the trends and really tracking those trends, and not with
[00:55:01.527 --> 00:55:08.512]  In the phone booth kind of conversation with real hard documents, something that we're well known for, it became obvious where it was headed.
[00:55:08.612 --> 00:55:14.897]  And at some point, you know, the public gets to the point where they just won't stand it anymore.
[00:55:15.277 --> 00:55:19.941]  And the objective of the public is information, public media.
[00:55:20.081 --> 00:55:24.104]  The critical element is not just saying whatever you want, it's keeping the informed public.
[00:55:24.124 --> 00:55:25.545]  That's what Freedom of the Press was about.
[00:55:26.045 --> 00:55:35.870]  Why I got involved in this was we saw the mainstream, really the corporate tool for manipulating not just culture, but I travel all over the world.
[00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:41.033]  We see the same overlays in Europe, in the US, Latin America.
[00:55:41.833 --> 00:55:46.917]  But they kind of culturally correct it so that they can influence the same outcomes, and that's where we are today.
[00:55:47.037 --> 00:55:51.761]  So they're using the anthropology and they admit it, and when you see it, it's so sick.
[00:55:51.801 --> 00:55:56.044]  Like PSAs, don't sleep with your baby, give it formula.
[00:55:56.285 --> 00:56:01.569]  Well they know that reduces IQ 15-20 points, makes the person basically a sociopath.
[00:56:02.571 --> 00:56:03.412]  I mean, it's amazing.
[00:56:03.712 --> 00:56:05.673]  You know, and that's exactly it.
[00:56:05.853 --> 00:56:08.435]  It's a case of dumbing the population down.
[00:56:08.576 --> 00:56:12.599]  I was in public education for a number of years looking at how that has changed.
[00:56:13.099 --> 00:56:14.880]  Where are the thinking people?
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:20.064]  And they're plugged into the alternative media where there is a remnant of truth that comes out.
[00:56:20.124 --> 00:56:20.465]  Exactly.
[00:56:20.485 --> 00:56:26.909]  Dr. Becker, so what does it say about an elite, not just in their white papers, when they want to dumb people down and then disease us?
[00:56:26.929 --> 00:56:29.431]  Because you're always saying, Alex, you worry about vaccines all day.
[00:56:29.812 --> 00:56:31.013]  It's the electromagnetic
[00:56:31.946 --> 00:56:35.549]  That's where the real... They really want to raise your chair up for some reason.
[00:56:35.569 --> 00:56:37.872]  Let's just go ahead and do it, because for some reason it popped down.
[00:56:38.072 --> 00:56:38.632]  Hey, it's live.
[00:56:38.652 --> 00:56:39.393]  It's no big deal, folks.
[00:56:39.413 --> 00:56:40.594]  We're teleprompter free here.
[00:56:40.614 --> 00:56:42.056]  This is the best part of the show.
[00:56:42.076 --> 00:56:43.177]  Again, Dr. Nick Beggs is our guest.
[00:56:43.197 --> 00:56:44.038]  That happens to me all the time.
[00:56:44.058 --> 00:56:45.159]  I'll hit the button and it, like, falls down.
[00:56:45.179 --> 00:56:45.319]  Oops.
[00:56:45.919 --> 00:56:46.300]  Who cares?
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:55.608]  But, I mean, seriously, we're not here... They script themselves as savers of the earth wanting to tax carbon, while they're genetically engineering, doing all this stuff we know is actually hurting the earth.
[00:56:56.269 --> 00:56:58.790]  And then they admit their own, you know, internal documents.
[00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:00.230]  They're going to overwrite the whole planet.
[00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:04.191]  They think they're God, like Promethean engineers, you know, in the Prometheus movie.
[00:57:04.612 --> 00:57:05.792]  That's who they think they are.
[00:57:06.612 --> 00:57:08.193]  And they just think we're like a bug.
[00:57:08.213 --> 00:57:12.354]  I mean, even Elon Musk last month said, oh, you'll assimilate or you'll just be squashed like a bug.
[00:57:12.884 --> 00:57:14.184]  Well, and this is the attitude.
[00:57:14.264 --> 00:57:17.845]  It's a lack of humanity in multinationals.
[00:57:17.865 --> 00:57:25.407]  You know, the Supreme Court's given multinationals and global organizations the same rights as living human souls.
[00:57:26.267 --> 00:57:27.388]  This is a big problem.
[00:57:27.448 --> 00:57:32.849]  This is taking away... And now they want to give computers souls and quote tax them, but that means the elites program them.
[00:57:32.869 --> 00:57:33.409]  They're not human.
[00:57:33.729 --> 00:57:34.450]  That's correct.
[00:57:34.610 --> 00:57:42.676]  In fact, I read a statistic today, 57% of jobs worldwide are going to evaporate over the next 10 to 15 years.
[00:57:43.016 --> 00:57:44.577]  Now what happens to all those people?
[00:57:45.117 --> 00:57:55.045]  And you know, even today in the United States, the statistics just came out in the New York Times, rising suicide rates among white males, white women, by over 130% increases over the last
[00:57:57.486 --> 00:57:57.966]  24 U.S.
[00:57:58.046 --> 00:57:59.587]  soldiers committed suicide a day.
[00:57:59.687 --> 00:58:00.207]  Record number.
[00:58:00.587 --> 00:58:01.887]  That's a test program group.
[00:58:01.907 --> 00:58:04.808]  Just like the black community is a test group, the military is a test group.
[00:58:04.828 --> 00:58:07.909]  We're taking our best people and killing them, enslaving them, dumbing them down.
[00:58:07.929 --> 00:58:09.589]  But you've got to toot your horn.
[00:58:09.929 --> 00:58:11.190]  Talk about Earth rising.
[00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:20.472]  Even before the book came out, you talked about what the elite are scared of and how you were able to predict around 2017, 2018, this was coming, a decade plus ago.
[00:58:20.512 --> 00:58:21.012]  How did you do it?
[00:58:21.272 --> 00:58:27.874]  The Earth Rising Revolution was a book written just pre 9-11 and it was published in 2000 as a warning.
[00:58:28.335 --> 00:58:34.837]  Over 640 source documents were cited showing the trends in terms of personal privacy and personal liberty.
[00:58:35.137 --> 00:58:41.339]  The things you see now in the mainstream about surveillance, we were talking about this almost 17 years ago.
[00:58:41.359 --> 00:58:41.759]  Skip it.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:45.261]  And it was really clear to see where we were headed.
[00:58:45.601 --> 00:58:48.702]  And where we're headed is where we are right now, at the point of
[00:58:49.263 --> 00:58:52.251]  Revolutionary thinking on both the left and the right.
[00:58:52.312 --> 00:58:56.483]  But the kind of revolution we need is a revolution of thinking again.
[00:59:03.942 --> 00:59:11.046]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:59:11.406 --> 00:59:24.613]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
