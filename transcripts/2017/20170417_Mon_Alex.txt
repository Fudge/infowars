[00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:28.089]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.671]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:35.985]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, April 17th, 2017.
[00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:38.847]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:44.950]  Paul Joseph Watson will be hosting from the main studio in about 15-20 minutes with Mike Cernovich and others.
[00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:51.374]  Now, we're facing the greatest threat, not just the existence of InfoWars, but to free speech in this country.
[00:00:52.054 --> 00:01:05.383]  You've seen the mainstream news articles admitting Google and others plan to shut down the new right, libertarians, nationalists, not just here, but all over Europe and other parts of the world, who are standing up to the unelected authoritarian system of globalism.
[00:01:06.104 --> 00:01:16.151]  Now, we can put on screen, Mike Cernovich has been around for years, but he's one of the top bloggers now in the world because he has such amazing sources inside the Trump administration and more.
[00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:17.532]  There it is from Fox News.
[00:01:18.192 --> 00:01:22.501]  Pro-Trump blogger, Cernovich, getting big scoops mainstream media attention.
[00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.667]  And they have to admit, okay, these are big scoops.
[00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:29.615]  Now, Cernovich came to Austin to visit with us.
[00:01:30.826 --> 00:01:50.164]  And we were doing a broadcast about censorship and he was sent by his Google insider of five years, and I've seen the intel, I've seen the text messages, I've seen the basic identity to document this, of the internal Google order and memorandum that represents absolute total fraud.
[00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:53.687]  Ladies and gentlemen, they direct their contractors to go vote us down.
[00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:13.326]  And then they say, oh, but this is all free, fair, and open.
[00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:15.127]  Again, a total fraud on its face.
[00:02:15.727 --> 00:02:29.251]  They then misrepresent what we say and what we do and say that we're not credible, playing clips of Ron Paul, Vladimir Putin, and Assad saying that the Syrian gas attack was probably a false flag.
[00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:34.773]  In our article they list, they say we give no proof, we list
[00:02:36.898 --> 00:02:42.001]  Sky Television and other mainstream news outlets with the interviews.
[00:02:43.042 --> 00:02:49.786]  So understand, we're being delisted and blocked and put into an electronic gulag that Matt Drudge warned about.
[00:02:49.806 --> 00:02:54.669]  I'm going to go over the internal documents when we come back and break these here on air.
[00:02:57.623 --> 00:03:02.686]  Saying that we're not showing our sources when we are showing our sources.
[00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:07.410]  And then they go on and say, CNN is a good news source.
[00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.713]  Many of you are going to ask, why are you banning InfoWars when CNN had the very same headline?
[00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:15.995]  And they go on to say, well, CNN's popular and liked.
[00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:18.237]  And they showed other commentary.
[00:03:18.897 --> 00:03:26.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the article they list, we have Sky News, you name it, and other MSM that we're actually linking to.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.741]  Of course Putin's saying it's a false flag, it's newsworthy.
[00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:32.162]  Of course Assad's saying it's a false flag, it's newsworthy.
[00:03:32.382 --> 00:03:34.823]  Of course Ron Paul's saying it's a false flag, it's newsworthy.
[00:03:35.063 --> 00:03:44.327]  They say we are to be delisted, and I have the quotes, we're going to come back from break and cover these, they say that we're going to be delisted because
[00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:55.224]  If you read right here, compare this InfoWars article, it's brief and only mentions statement sources, not really typical.
[00:03:55.724 --> 00:04:05.327]  Putin, former Congressman Ron Paul and Assad, which seem to be making the same case here that bolsters the site's previously held perspectives, which cut against the grain to say the least.
[00:04:05.927 --> 00:04:06.467]  Wow!
[00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:07.628]  Wow!
[00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:11.669]  So, I play clips from Sky Television,
[00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:19.752]  From our team, and from the BBC, right here, chemical attack fabricated Assad.
[00:04:21.914 --> 00:04:23.856]  Business Insider, Putin, U.S.
[00:04:23.876 --> 00:04:26.839]  planning false flag attacks in Syria to frame Assad for chemical weapons.
[00:04:28.072 --> 00:04:45.835]  Understand, they're saying we're discredited and we're banned and we're gonna be removed because we previously said there were fake chemical attacks and now world leaders were agreeing with us and calling for an investigation because we were right.
[00:04:46.275 --> 00:04:46.915]  We're bad.
[00:04:47.136 --> 00:04:48.856]  Because we trailblazed, we're bad.
[00:04:49.097 --> 00:04:57.621]  Because we had military sources on in 2013 and last year, when the rebels got caught doing it, and Sy Hersh has come out, and the UN has come out.
[00:04:57.701 --> 00:04:58.602]  That's why we're bad.
[00:04:58.842 --> 00:04:59.742]  That's why we're banned.
[00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:00.523]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.543 --> 00:05:00.943]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.028 --> 00:05:05.129]  You have no money?
[00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.351]  This is okay, we will take your blood.
[00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:12.975]  If you want access to the Vatican Museums, cash, visa, MasterCard, or needle is accepted.
[00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:16.639]  That's right, you can give blood to access the Vatican Museums.
[00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:21.342]  The blood payment plan has a slogan, give blood and follow your artistic inclination.
[00:05:21.663 --> 00:05:24.925]  Blood donors then receive a voucher which gives them access to the museums.
[00:05:25.286 --> 00:05:28.909]  The director of the Vatican Museums said, without blood there is no life.
[00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.831]  Without art, life would be empty and sad.
[00:05:32.551 --> 00:05:34.232]  Okay, I love Jesus too.
[00:05:34.332 --> 00:05:35.013]  Happy Easter!
[00:05:35.733 --> 00:05:36.934]  I guess this is a good idea.
[00:05:37.354 --> 00:05:40.016]  Get some blood donations and allow people access to history.
[00:05:40.296 --> 00:05:41.637]  Sounds harmless, but wait!
[00:05:42.058 --> 00:05:44.619]  Each blood donation is good for a 4 euro voucher.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.381]  It costs 16 euros to access the museums.
[00:05:48.102 --> 00:05:51.084]  So you have to donate blood four times before you can even get in.
[00:05:51.804 --> 00:05:54.429]  By the time you've given enough blood, you'd have fainted!
[00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.276]  Enjoy Michelangelo's Last Judgment as you recover from hypovolemia.
[00:05:59.797 --> 00:06:02.020]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[00:06:03.775 --> 00:06:05.197]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:06:05.377 --> 00:06:07.779]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemistry.
[00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:15.266]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:25.776]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:06:26.096 --> 00:06:33.658]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[00:06:33.938 --> 00:06:43.881]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:46.082]  And this part is most important.
[00:06:46.182 --> 00:06:52.644]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:06:53.004 --> 00:06:54.045]  That means it's clean.
[00:06:54.445 --> 00:06:55.346]  That means it's pure.
[00:06:55.566 --> 00:06:58.348]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:06:58.468 --> 00:07:01.070]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.891]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:07:03.877 --> 00:07:07.460]  I'm going to commit blasphemy against the globalists right now in the New World Order.
[00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:21.093]  I'm going to tell all of you that we're celebrating the Christian holiday of Easter, our risen Christ, on the third day by having some of the biggest specials ever at InfoWarsTore.com on amazing supplements.
[00:07:21.533 --> 00:07:26.098]  You know, mainstream media demonizes us for selling high-quality organic supplements that are game changers.
[00:07:26.398 --> 00:07:29.501]  Well, they have all the poison, big pharma drug ads all day.
[00:07:31.282 --> 00:07:33.724]  What a shameful group of wicked devils.
[00:07:34.384 --> 00:07:38.567]  Ladies and gentlemen, our Christ raised from the dead on the third day.
[00:07:39.707 --> 00:07:46.512]  And our Republic can rise from the dead if we wake up to what the globalists are doing and if you support independent free media.
[00:07:46.932 --> 00:07:51.295]  There's never been a better time to support InfoWars with these specials at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:51.715 --> 00:07:53.016]  Because it's all about life.
[00:07:53.676 --> 00:07:55.236]  It is Monday, the 17th day of April 2017.
[00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:56.077]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:07:56.097 --> 00:08:01.518]  Paul Joseph Watson and Mike Cernovich and others are coming up from the main studio here in just about 10 minutes or so.
[00:08:17.537 --> 00:08:22.621]  We obviously have the Vice President making a rare visit to the DMZ in South Korea.
[00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:30.767]  We have major escalations there with the head of the National Security Council saying that North Korea is coming to a head.
[00:08:31.088 --> 00:08:33.549]  All of this is going to be broken down here today.
[00:08:33.569 --> 00:08:37.412]  I think it's a big victory that North Korea didn't test a nuke.
[00:08:37.973 --> 00:08:39.634]  Clearly they backed down to Trump so far.
[00:08:39.994 --> 00:08:41.035]  That's unprecedented.
[00:08:41.416 --> 00:08:42.857]  We're going to be breaking that down today.
[00:08:44.454 --> 00:08:53.023]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is an attempt to strangle InfoWars, and MSM even admits if they're successful with us, they'll be able to shut down Drudge, they'll be able to shut down everybody else.
[00:08:53.703 --> 00:08:56.246]  That's why I rarely ask Drudge to cover a story.
[00:08:56.727 --> 00:09:02.472]  He covers our stories without us asking, but I am asking Drudge to link to the story on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:02.873 --> 00:09:06.376]  Dr. Corsi's also expanding on Mike Cernovich's breaking news.
[00:09:07.017 --> 00:09:14.520]  We can put Fox News on screen for you that Mike Cernovich is very respected because he's broken so many stories that end up to be absolutely on target.
[00:09:15.201 --> 00:09:17.562]  I happen to know some of his sources, they are in the White House.
[00:09:18.082 --> 00:09:20.963]  Cernovich is, quite frankly, better than I am at working the sources.
[00:09:21.523 --> 00:09:26.886]  There it is, pro-Trump blogger Cernovich getting big scoops, mainstream media attention.
[00:09:26.906 --> 00:09:27.686]  That's Fox News.
[00:09:27.806 --> 00:09:29.447]  And the reason I raise that is that
[00:09:31.462 --> 00:09:33.463]  The media says we're fake, we're not real.
[00:09:33.983 --> 00:09:35.444]  Because we are on target.
[00:09:35.984 --> 00:09:39.466]  Now sometimes I engage in satire on air, and it's very clear when it's satire.
[00:09:39.886 --> 00:09:42.528]  And the media takes it out of context and says, do you really mean this?
[00:09:42.928 --> 00:09:48.571]  And I say, no, I'm illustrating what I'm doing, using humor, using satire.
[00:09:49.071 --> 00:09:52.993]  And I always tell you when I'm doing it, when I'm doing that as, quote, an actor.
[00:09:53.553 --> 00:10:00.837]  But what I say and do on air as Alex Jones, what I stand for, our philosophies of the Second Amendment, sovereignty.
[00:10:01.926 --> 00:10:05.629]  That's who I am at my total core, and we've changed the world together.
[00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.312]  And I've never seen such a barrage.
[00:10:08.772 --> 00:10:16.339]  Thousands of articles the last week, hundreds today, with the most upside-down, twisted garbage that I've ever seen.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:22.625]  Now, Mike Cernovich, breathlessly, last night, called me and said, can you meet?
[00:10:22.965 --> 00:10:23.545]  He was in town.
[00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:25.312]  You've already been on the show Friday.
[00:10:25.332 --> 00:10:25.812]  I said, sure.
[00:10:25.832 --> 00:10:29.055]  Went down and met he and his wife, Buckley, and others went with me.
[00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:30.796]  And he said, look at this.
[00:10:30.876 --> 00:10:37.301]  And he showed me the source, showed me the information inside Google, showed me his texts with a guy going back years.
[00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:41.484]  This is a really good source of his inside a major Google contracting company.
[00:10:41.504 --> 00:10:46.568]  The service has some amazing contacts.
[00:10:46.588 --> 00:10:47.989]  We were talking to some of them last night.
[00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:49.850]  Some of them are billionaires in the tech world.
[00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:50.631]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:53.213]  And they're really concerned about what's happening.
[00:10:54.890 --> 00:11:02.734]  And so Google has taken out a major contract to delist InfoWars.com from its search engine.
[00:11:04.135 --> 00:11:15.180]  And earlier in the last segment, I called what they're doing criminal, when a big multinational company organizes people secretly and pays them to go bury someone artificially.
[00:11:16.331 --> 00:11:21.653]  And then claims that their search algorithm is real when they actually are hiring people to manipulate it.
[00:11:21.753 --> 00:11:23.354]  That is fraud against the public.
[00:11:24.214 --> 00:11:31.477]  The Washington Post three months ago had to retract their fake news list that had myself and others in it because people started filing suit on them.
[00:11:31.497 --> 00:11:34.339]  You just can't say we're all fake news and delist us.
[00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:42.182]  So in their crafty little letter that's on Infowars.com that went out to all Google contractors in their search engine system,
[00:11:43.522 --> 00:11:51.125]  It says, now we can't say he's fake, because he can sue us, but you just take matters into your own hands, but you will say medium or poor.
[00:11:51.986 --> 00:11:54.907]  You will say low or medium.
[00:11:55.347 --> 00:12:01.009]  So it's all written by lawyers, but it's so good to have it internally, to see how they're doing it.
[00:12:01.109 --> 00:12:05.611]  And here's where it gets incredible, because they can shut us up, they can shut you up.
[00:12:06.232 --> 00:12:07.472]  Here's where it gets amazing.
[00:12:08.072 --> 00:12:11.114]  They list the fact that I list Ron Paul as a source,
[00:12:12.168 --> 00:12:17.915]  And they say Ron Paul is not credible, and that that is the grounds for us.
[00:12:18.296 --> 00:12:28.209]  When Ron Paul said two weeks ago, the day after the chemical attack, that the rebels got caught before, he gave the source of the UN report, it was all over mainstream news.
[00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:29.931]  Who would benefit?
[00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:37.256]  It makes no sense, even if you were totally separate from this, and take no signs of this, and you were just an analyst.
[00:12:37.816 --> 00:12:42.800]  It doesn't make any sense for Sodom, these conditions, to all of a sudden use poison gases.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:51.125]  I think it's zero chance that he would have done this, you know, deliberately, and he's doing this now.
[00:12:51.926 --> 00:12:57.069]  In 2013, then again in 2016, they got caught launching a chemical attack.
[00:12:57.129 --> 00:12:58.790]  This is all over mainstream news.
[00:12:59.671 --> 00:13:01.153]  Ron Paul's crime is he has a memory.
[00:13:02.494 --> 00:13:04.076]  Then Putin came out and said it.
[00:13:04.396 --> 00:13:14.748]  We have information from various sources that a similar provocation, and I can't call it anything other than a provocation, is being prepared in other parts of Syria.
[00:13:16.479 --> 00:13:17.439]  Then Assad said it.
[00:13:17.459 --> 00:13:18.660]  Cy Hirsch has said it.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.180]  Pulitzer Prize winner.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.402]  They say that because we wrote an article and used Ron Paul as a source, that it was uncredible.
[00:13:37.892 --> 00:13:41.313]  Then they say, but you're asking, why does CNN have the same headline, false flag?
[00:13:41.593 --> 00:13:45.374]  They said, well, they're credible and respected and people like them.
[00:13:45.574 --> 00:13:49.615]  It actually says this, because people like CNN, which is a total lie.
[00:13:49.635 --> 00:13:51.056]  They have a 6% approval rating.
[00:13:51.976 --> 00:13:53.796]  They're known to be one of the most untrusted groups.
[00:13:54.036 --> 00:13:59.438]  They got caught in WikiLeaks with Google, with the White House, with Hillary, fixing search results.
[00:13:59.458 --> 00:14:00.038]  Remember all that?
[00:14:00.964 --> 00:14:01.585]  Remember all that?
[00:14:02.586 --> 00:14:03.546]  So they're the fraud.
[00:14:04.127 --> 00:14:05.148]  They're the fake garbage.
[00:14:05.168 --> 00:14:10.072]  They're the ones that gave us the fake polls and gave Hillary the questions beforehand and got caught doing all of it.
[00:14:11.474 --> 00:14:15.498]  And so they actually say, because we use Ron Paul,
[00:14:17.608 --> 00:14:21.269]  And they say, you know, for us to say he's low or medium, that's a little kind.
[00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.210]  You probably want to go more negative.
[00:14:23.931 --> 00:14:26.011]  So clearly, I've got big lawyers in D.C.
[00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:29.093]  that already want to do something previously, and I'm just too busy getting the news out.
[00:14:29.113 --> 00:14:31.053]  But I mean, we all have to stand up legally.
[00:14:31.754 --> 00:14:33.074]  The White House has to stand up.
[00:14:33.114 --> 00:14:36.075]  They're strangling the search results for what President Trump says and does.
[00:14:36.496 --> 00:14:40.497]  The Democrats are on the news telling Google to strangle results and do this.
[00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:43.498]  This is Communist Chinese-style control.
[00:14:43.738 --> 00:14:44.819]  Let me, if you're a radio listener,
[00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:50.663]  I'll read to you what it says from their bounty that's gone out.
[00:14:50.683 --> 00:14:55.026]  And I'll put up on screen the Infowars.com article that they say doesn't show any credible sources.
[00:14:55.947 --> 00:15:07.695]  It has a link to Sky News, it has a link to a bunch of other mainstream video clips of world leaders saying, Vladimir Putin saying, others saying it's a false flag.
[00:15:08.243 --> 00:15:12.326]  Let's suppose we have this arsenal and let's suppose that we have the will to use it.
[00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:16.849]  Why didn't we use it when we were retreating and the terrorists were advancing?
[00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:28.357]  Actually, the timing of that attack or alleged attack was when the Syrian army was advancing very fast and actually the terrorists were collapsing.
[00:15:29.078 --> 00:15:31.820]  So, why to use it if you have it and if you have the will?
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.281]  Why to use it at that timing?
[00:15:33.841 --> 00:15:35.862]  Not when you are in a difficult situation.
[00:15:36.222 --> 00:15:36.702]  Logically.
[00:15:37.103 --> 00:15:37.643]  This is first.
[00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:47.747]  Second, if you want to use it, if you have it, and if you want to use it again, this is, if we suppose, why to use it against civilians, not to use it against the terrorists that we are fighting?
[00:15:47.767 --> 00:15:54.050]  Third, in that area, we don't have army, we don't have battles.
[00:15:56.031 --> 00:16:01.254]  We don't have any, let's say, object in Khan Sheikhoun, and it's not a strategic area.
[00:16:01.674 --> 00:16:02.514]  Why to attack it?
[00:16:02.995 --> 00:16:04.015]  What's the reason?
[00:16:04.275 --> 00:16:08.858]  Militarily, I'm talking about military, from a military point of view.
[00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:14.980]  Of course, the foundation for us morally, we wouldn't do it if we have it.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.501]  We wouldn't have the will because morally this is not acceptable.
[00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:20.942]  We won't have the support of the public.
[00:16:21.202 --> 00:16:24.843]  So every indication is against the whole story.
[00:16:24.863 --> 00:16:29.004]  So we can say that this play that they staged doesn't hold together.
[00:16:29.044 --> 00:16:31.305]  The story is not convincing by any means.
[00:16:32.345 --> 00:16:38.807]  And then we are not supposed to be able to even show you that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:38.847 --> 00:16:39.327]  So here it is.
[00:16:42.239 --> 00:16:43.640]  It says bonus example.
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.562]  It goes on to say, what about this news article which covers the same subject?
[00:16:50.383 --> 00:16:53.904]  We'd give it a rating of high to high plus.
[00:16:54.705 --> 00:17:01.648]  While CNN isn't a perfect news outlet, it's a popular news source that covers the story with in-depth and mostly straightforward reporting.
[00:17:01.928 --> 00:17:08.291]  There are clips of an interview with Assad and quotes from experts that help promote and provide context that would be helpful to any user.
[00:17:09.011 --> 00:17:14.773]  To compare to Infowars article, it is brief, only mentions statements from sources not really typical.
[00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:24.157]  Putin, former congressman Ron Paul and Assad himself, which seem to be making the case here that bolsters the site's previously held perspectives, which cut against the grain.
[00:17:26.075 --> 00:17:28.096]  And it just goes on to say, shot us down.
[00:17:28.616 --> 00:17:35.778]  And they go on to say that we're being kind, only saying that they are medium to poor.
[00:17:36.518 --> 00:17:39.919]  Negative reputation is sufficient to give a page a low rating.
[00:17:40.199 --> 00:17:42.199]  They go on to say CNN has a good reputation.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.700]  Where's your facts on that?
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.240]  I've got a Pew poll.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.681]  I've got a Gallup poll from last year, Associated Press.
[00:17:49.541 --> 00:17:52.182]  Just 6% of people say they trust media.
[00:17:52.402 --> 00:17:53.743]  And that means mainstream media.
[00:17:54.043 --> 00:17:54.743]  You can read the study.
[00:17:56.676 --> 00:18:03.444]  So they have a 6%, but you're saying they have this incredibly high trusted rating.
[00:18:03.864 --> 00:18:07.628]  You scroll down, that's Associated Press right there, posted to Breitbart.
[00:18:08.829 --> 00:18:14.376]  So, Google takes out major contract to deal with InfoWars from its search index.
[00:18:14.396 --> 00:18:16.198]  Now remember, Google announced last month
[00:18:17.455 --> 00:18:29.962]  They said, we are going to test in certain countries having a rating system that when you go through our browser, it tells you whether it's trusted or whether it's not trusted or whether it's bad.
[00:18:31.502 --> 00:18:35.985]  And then we're going to use Snopes and other Democratic Party groups to decide what's real and what isn't.
[00:18:37.816 --> 00:18:42.818]  Now this is all secretive, but we have the documents up on InfoWars.com from inside Google.
[00:18:43.419 --> 00:18:51.063]  And you should go read them for yourself, where they describe how to do this, and now how they're just going to drive you down in the search results where you can't even be seen.
[00:18:51.583 --> 00:18:53.023]  And understand, they've done this before.
[00:18:53.104 --> 00:19:01.388]  WikiLeaks, Assange, Google directly allied with the Clinton campaign, driving down their search results so you couldn't read WikiLeaks.
[00:19:01.528 --> 00:19:03.789]  WikiLeaks is now listed as fake news.
[00:19:04.975 --> 00:19:05.556]  By Google.
[00:19:06.376 --> 00:19:09.419]  You couldn't get more real than sourced, real documents.
[00:19:09.579 --> 00:19:12.522]  No one's ever denied these WikiLeaks documents are real.
[00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:14.924]  But remember what Cuomo said on CNN.
[00:19:15.344 --> 00:19:16.625]  You're not allowed to read WikiLeaks.
[00:19:16.765 --> 00:19:17.666]  Only CNN is.
[00:19:17.926 --> 00:19:19.848]  So you don't read them or you can get in trouble.
[00:19:21.274 --> 00:19:22.015]  And that's what they're saying.
[00:19:22.215 --> 00:19:24.137]  You're not allowed to visit InfoWars.com.
[00:19:24.317 --> 00:19:27.641]  You're not allowed to visit PrisonPlanet.com, which Google delisted years ago.
[00:19:28.842 --> 00:19:31.505]  You're not allowed to actually go see our information.
[00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:34.769]  You're not actually allowed to decide for yourself.
[00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.531]  But what's crazy is they say...
[00:19:37.632 --> 00:19:42.074]  All these world leaders coming out and agreeing with Alex Jones about a false flag gives them credibility.
[00:19:42.875 --> 00:19:45.116]  So they're only posting things that give them credibility.
[00:19:45.156 --> 00:19:46.016]  What are you talking about?
[00:19:46.236 --> 00:19:49.738]  The rebels have been caught launching staged chemical attacks.
[00:19:50.118 --> 00:19:51.719]  That is mainstream news.
[00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:59.002]  And now, without any investigation, they're coming out and saying that Assad did this again.
[00:19:59.682 --> 00:20:01.683]  We're here with common sense standing against this.
[00:20:02.204 --> 00:20:02.604]  Stay with us.
[00:20:13.061 --> 00:20:20.988]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:21.028 --> 00:20:22.990]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:30.656]  We could easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand different products.
[00:20:31.257 --> 00:20:37.042]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20 because we private label some, but we also develop
[00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:47.693]  Many of the products originally were some of the top labs in the country, so that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe, and they're also very affordable.
[00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:49.834]  Exactly, you talk about being a game changer, right?
[00:20:49.874 --> 00:20:54.495]  You talk about, we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders, we've both talked to them.
[00:20:54.835 --> 00:21:00.737]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[00:21:01.077 --> 00:21:10.039]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[00:21:10.899 --> 00:21:12.019]  We refuse to screw people.
[00:21:12.359 --> 00:21:13.320]  We refuse to do that.
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.360]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.441]  We're producing something we want to take.
[00:21:18.541 --> 00:21:19.222]  Exactly.
[00:21:19.262 --> 00:21:20.302]  We're looking for the best.
[00:21:20.363 --> 00:21:25.227]  We went out and searched for the best, the private label, and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[00:21:25.427 --> 00:21:29.090]  So we go to these big firms and say, we want to make the dream formula.
[00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:35.095]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[00:21:35.375 --> 00:21:36.596]  It's everywhere.
[00:21:36.776 --> 00:21:37.457]  It's in nature.
[00:21:37.497 --> 00:21:39.599]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[00:21:39.979 --> 00:21:46.004]  Just this bottle of silica, okay, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount that's even in our product, is $35.
[00:21:47.185 --> 00:21:52.427]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[00:21:52.467 --> 00:21:53.108]  This is insane.
[00:21:53.128 --> 00:22:03.192]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, okay, I get that you guys want to do, you know, high-powered stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000 and then you can sell, you know, multiple bottles of it, people will buy more of it.
[00:22:03.212 --> 00:22:04.152]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[00:22:04.292 --> 00:22:05.793]  Okay, compare that to this.
[00:22:06.013 --> 00:22:08.754]  This is a $50 product, one of the leaders in the industry.
[00:22:09.114 --> 00:22:10.935]  It has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:11.475]  Okay, we have 10,000.
[00:22:11.555 --> 00:22:12.636]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[00:22:15.077 --> 00:22:16.918]  There's no script, there's no teleprompter, I'll just be honest with you.
[00:22:17.338 --> 00:22:22.601]  My problem is, with 20 products now, it's remembering to take them all.
[00:22:23.201 --> 00:22:26.483]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[00:22:26.883 --> 00:22:32.846]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product,
[00:22:33.965 --> 00:22:35.587]  My quality of life just isn't as good.
[00:22:35.667 --> 00:22:36.768]  It's changed my life.
[00:22:36.848 --> 00:22:39.110]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:41.312]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[00:22:41.713 --> 00:22:43.154]  I was jogging, lifting weights.
[00:22:43.214 --> 00:22:44.075]  I couldn't lose the weight.
[00:22:44.976 --> 00:22:52.043]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[00:22:52.444 --> 00:22:53.204]  It's a win-win.
[00:22:53.685 --> 00:22:54.446]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:23:04.201 --> 00:23:12.345]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:23:13.325 --> 00:23:22.129]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption, and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:29.473]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme, and they've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:23:29.493 --> 00:23:30.994]  We now have George Soros.
[00:23:32.094 --> 00:23:32.834]  As a goblin.
[00:23:33.515 --> 00:23:39.297]  On the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:23:40.038 --> 00:23:44.400]  It says, deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[00:23:46.641 --> 00:23:53.724]  So, it is a limited edition, deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[00:23:54.084 --> 00:23:54.664]  It's powerful.
[00:23:54.684 --> 00:23:55.725]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.
[00:23:56.005 --> 00:23:57.766]  InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[00:24:15.655 --> 00:24:18.436]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, we're the opposite of fake news.
[00:24:18.496 --> 00:24:19.017]  We're real.
[00:24:19.917 --> 00:24:21.077]  But we are passionate.
[00:24:21.177 --> 00:24:23.899]  We wear our bias to tell the truth on our sleeves.
[00:24:25.499 --> 00:24:27.060]  And we do it through hard news reporting.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.101]  We do it through punditry analysis.
[00:24:29.781 --> 00:24:32.963]  I've done it through satire and comedy and dressing up like the Joker.
[00:24:34.403 --> 00:24:42.567]  But at the end of the day, do you really think Assad would launch a chemical attack on his own people when the government said, we're going to come in and take you out if you do?
[00:24:44.022 --> 00:24:45.503]  When the rebels have been caught doing it before.
[00:24:45.804 --> 00:24:47.245]  That's your own common sense.
[00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:57.774]  And it's because we are promoting common sense, challenging the countervailing lies and fraud we're being force-fed that they don't want any other voices out there challenging them.
[00:24:59.076 --> 00:25:06.322]  And they want to have Google, one of the biggest corporations in the world, gang up on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:06.502 --> 00:25:09.065]  We were delisted off AdRoll that advertises through Google.
[00:25:10.578 --> 00:25:16.723]  We've had the Democrats and David Brock and all of them calling for us to be shut down off Google and banned off YouTube, and I'm sure that's next.
[00:25:17.443 --> 00:25:26.931]  This is all part of the strangling us out first and killing our credibility and assassinating our character before they completely shut us off.
[00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:30.634]  And understand this, if they can shut us off, freedom dies in the dark.
[00:25:30.974 --> 00:25:39.461]  The Washington Post pushing the call to shut down new media, alternative media, are the very purveyors of the darkness they claim they're fighting.
[00:25:40.899 --> 00:25:42.500]  We are promoting common sense.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.481]  We are promoting the sovereignty of this nation.
[00:25:44.821 --> 00:25:51.824]  We are promoting what's really in Obamacare, the death panels and the doubling prices and Gruber saying, thank God you're so dumb.
[00:25:52.104 --> 00:25:53.905]  They don't want us showing you, Gruber.
[00:25:54.405 --> 00:26:02.268]  They don't want us showing you where they sit here in their own internal documents and say that we've got to be shut down, we've got to be destroyed.
[00:26:03.569 --> 00:26:08.571]  And then saying that we're crazy, you know, that showing a Ron Paul clip is incredible.
[00:26:10.117 --> 00:26:21.672]  You know how scared they are knowing that Paul Watson is there and Matt Drudge is there and Mike Cernovich is there and countless others that are willing to actually talk to people in government that are patriots and put out the information?
[00:26:23.911 --> 00:26:34.564]  Eight years ago, when we got the Homeland Security report saying they were training to take on veterans and gun owners and saying we were the number one terror threat, people didn't believe that document for a week, even though I got it from federal marshal.
[00:26:35.085 --> 00:26:42.113]  Then I got sent in more copies by state police, the local versions, and the media had to admit, yes, that's a real document, and we stand by.
[00:26:43.171 --> 00:26:47.233]  We stand by the claim that veterans are the number one terror threat in America.
[00:26:48.094 --> 00:26:53.837]  InfoWars has broken thousands of national stories that you would have never heard, that would have never been out there.
[00:26:54.657 --> 00:27:00.421]  Thanks to whistleblowers and patriots like the Google contractor who sent us this information so that we know about it.
[00:27:00.901 --> 00:27:03.622]  I am very upset about this, not for InfoWars.
[00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:09.646]  I'm very proud of the fact that we've been so prominent in the fight against the globalists that we now are the tip of the spear in this.
[00:27:10.694 --> 00:27:11.676]  But we're a bellwether.
[00:27:12.298 --> 00:27:16.226]  And if we don't stand strong, and if you don't stand strong with us, we don't have any future.
[00:27:17.096 --> 00:27:21.137]  They are putting out lies about us that are so twisted now on every front.
[00:27:21.277 --> 00:27:24.358]  It is, it is, it is truly unbelievable.
[00:27:24.879 --> 00:27:31.621]  They've got headlines everywhere, you know, out there saying things that I never said or I never did because the enemy is scared.
[00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:44.165]  They know there's a revolution inside corporations, inside government, everywhere else against their tyranny, and they don't know what to do, and they openly admit they want a technocracy to bring in total AI control and censorship.
[00:27:45.407 --> 00:28:00.525]  Where AI computers are watching and censoring and surveilling in live time, so the people don't even have to make the decisions, so the big algorithms make the decisions on how you're penalized, or how you're fired, with this WebID rating system, where if you're not a good globalist, you get delisted.
[00:28:01.687 --> 00:28:04.168]  With your cultural avatar?
[00:28:04.188 --> 00:28:06.269]  And you're like, oh my god, absolutely.
[00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:09.250]  What they're doing to us is a beta test for you.
[00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:19.213]  That's why it's more essential than it's ever been for people to realize this is a fight between humans, and our free speech, and our will, and the social engineers.
[00:28:19.934 --> 00:28:28.317]  And that's why it's more important than ever that you spread the links to InfoWars.com, and that you point out that this is happening, and that you call Talk Radio, and that you call Congress.
[00:28:29.451 --> 00:28:31.833]  Because the system thinks you're just going to roll over.
[00:28:32.294 --> 00:28:34.035]  The system thinks that you can be broken.
[00:28:34.456 --> 00:28:36.117]  They think that you can be dominated.
[00:28:36.158 --> 00:28:37.439]  They think that they've already won.
[00:28:37.459 --> 00:28:40.802]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've always strove to tell the truth.
[00:28:41.022 --> 00:28:44.325]  We've changed the world because of your action and what you've done.
[00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:47.290]  And now we are the brunt of the main assault.
[00:28:47.670 --> 00:29:06.284]  So I need all the other bloggers and all the other newspapers and publications that we've defended when they've been censored standing up for InfoWars.com because the censorship that Matt Drudge warned about a year and a half ago in my studio is now here because we have told the truth, because we are effective, and because they don't want you to have a voice.
[00:29:06.964 --> 00:29:09.987]  They want to be able to quietly shut everybody down.
[00:29:11.178 --> 00:29:14.321]  So again, what are you doing today to stand up and fight this?
[00:29:14.661 --> 00:29:15.682]  We're so close to winning.
[00:29:15.702 --> 00:29:18.044]  That's why they've really gambled pushing this.
[00:29:18.084 --> 00:29:19.225]  This is going to blow up in their face.
[00:29:20.612 --> 00:29:21.853]  They believe their AI can do it.
[00:29:21.893 --> 00:29:22.974]  They believe their censorship can do it.
[00:29:22.994 --> 00:29:28.077]  They believe going out and hiring armies of real people to go and manipulate their algorithm will turn this around.
[00:29:28.697 --> 00:29:31.539]  It won't if you stand up and if you take action.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.242]  We're fighting hard, ladies and gentlemen, and we need your support and your prayers now more than ever.
[00:29:36.603 --> 00:29:44.188]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson, Mike Cernovich, and others with the huge breaking scoop of Google's plan to end free speech in America.
[00:29:52.396 --> 00:29:55.399]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.003]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.484 --> 00:30:04.585]  You have no money?
[00:30:04.825 --> 00:30:06.807]  This is okay, we will take your blood.
[00:30:07.067 --> 00:30:12.412]  If you want access to the Vatican Museums, cash, visa, MasterCard or needle is accepted.
[00:30:12.732 --> 00:30:16.075]  That's right, you can give blood to access the Vatican Museum.
[00:30:16.335 --> 00:30:20.839]  The blood payment plan has a slogan, give blood and follow your artistic inclination.
[00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:24.382]  Blood donors then receive a voucher which gives them access to the museums.
[00:30:24.743 --> 00:30:28.386]  The director of the Vatican Museum said, without blood there is no life.
[00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:31.287]  Without art, life would be empty and sad.
[00:30:31.988 --> 00:30:33.688]  Okay, I love Jesus, too.
[00:30:33.768 --> 00:30:34.469]  Happy Easter!
[00:30:35.169 --> 00:30:36.370]  I guess this is a good idea.
[00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.451]  Get some blood donations and allow people access to history.
[00:30:39.751 --> 00:30:40.411]  Sounds harmless.
[00:30:40.632 --> 00:30:41.092]  But wait!
[00:30:41.492 --> 00:30:44.053]  Each blood donation is good for a four-euro voucher.
[00:30:44.453 --> 00:30:46.835]  It costs sixteen euros to access the museums.
[00:30:47.535 --> 00:30:50.696]  So you have to donate blood four times before you can even get in.
[00:30:51.277 --> 00:30:53.838]  By the time you've given enough blood, you'd have fainted.
[00:30:54.658 --> 00:30:58.701]  Enjoy Michelangelo's Last Judgment as you recover from hypovolemia.
[00:30:59.241 --> 00:31:01.463]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[00:31:03.604 --> 00:31:05.446]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[00:31:07.067 --> 00:31:12.751]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:31:13.431 --> 00:31:17.334]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:31:18.288 --> 00:31:20.489]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:31:20.589 --> 00:31:21.749]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:24.991]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:31:25.971 --> 00:31:26.311]  Or more.
[00:31:26.391 --> 00:31:28.172]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:31:28.812 --> 00:31:30.293]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:31:30.393 --> 00:31:33.754]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:31:33.854 --> 00:31:35.675]  It's actually scary.
[00:31:36.516 --> 00:31:41.758]  And it's because I take products that are researchers developed that block
[00:31:42.698 --> 00:31:46.582]  The estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:31:47.583 --> 00:32:00.394]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[00:32:03.294 --> 00:32:11.056]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:11.276 --> 00:32:17.698]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:32:17.918 --> 00:32:26.220]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:35.247]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:32:35.507 --> 00:32:41.251]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:32:41.591 --> 00:32:42.072]  It works.
[00:32:42.352 --> 00:32:50.660]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:32:50.820 --> 00:33:00.228]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the globalists all at the same time.
[00:33:00.569 --> 00:33:01.069]  A total 360 win.
[00:33:20.958 --> 00:33:21.779]  We are back live.
[00:33:21.819 --> 00:33:25.901]  I'm about to hand the baton to Paul Watson, Mike Cernovich, and others in the main studio.
[00:33:26.301 --> 00:33:28.122]  I have a closing statement for you today.
[00:33:28.142 --> 00:33:31.404]  Again, Alex Jones here on this Monday edition.
[00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:39.272]  The first thing they did when Trump got elected was say in mainstream news, corporate news, get rid of his Twitter, don't let him have it.
[00:33:39.772 --> 00:33:42.033]  And Twitter said, we'll consider taking it away from him.
[00:33:42.593 --> 00:33:43.773]  The President's Twitter.
[00:33:44.453 --> 00:33:50.115]  Think about the arrogance of these people working with the Communist Chinese and others to war game, bringing the censorship here.
[00:33:50.555 --> 00:33:51.576]  And we told you it was coming.
[00:33:52.596 --> 00:33:58.938]  So now, I'm blown away by the fact that they would use in their directive inside Google, to all contractors,
[00:34:00.319 --> 00:34:08.129]  The example of us being fake news and saying ban us, when they're the ones that have been caught manipulating the election, trying to defraud the American voters.
[00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.232]  They talk about outside Russian involvement.
[00:34:10.392 --> 00:34:16.240]  We had corporate global espionage by Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others openly working for Hillary Clinton.
[00:34:16.481 --> 00:34:17.462]  But still they failed!
[00:34:17.642 --> 00:34:18.523]  And that's why they're pissed.
[00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:20.245]  And it's not my opinion.
[00:34:20.285 --> 00:34:22.928]  It's clearly criminal what Google and others have done.
[00:34:23.368 --> 00:34:26.111]  And Trump needs to break them up for antitrust violations.
[00:34:26.472 --> 00:34:29.835]  If Google wants a war, there's going to be demonstrations out front your facility.
[00:34:30.356 --> 00:34:32.158]  As God is my witness, I'm coming soon.
[00:34:32.599 --> 00:34:33.800]  And we are going to the next level.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.442]  Lawsuits, you name it, we've got to do it.
[00:34:36.804 --> 00:34:38.746]  Everybody's got to contact Trump by letters.
[00:34:38.846 --> 00:34:40.147]  They've been caught trying to keep those from him.
[00:34:40.588 --> 00:34:41.849]  Everybody's got to go to events.
[00:34:42.289 --> 00:34:47.154]  Everybody's got to tweet at him and try to get him to go deep into the Twitter, because they only let the negative stuff go to the top.
[00:34:48.455 --> 00:34:49.756]  We've got to go demonstrate everywhere.
[00:34:49.816 --> 00:34:51.678]  Next time I talk to the president, front and center.
[00:34:52.358 --> 00:34:58.944]  The times I talk to him, I don't bring up how we're getting censorship or attacked, because I tend to be humble and don't talk about myself.
[00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:06.496]  Next time I talk to the president, next time Roger talks to him, which is very routine, I am going full tilt.
[00:35:06.576 --> 00:35:08.037]  You want a war, you got one.
[00:35:08.438 --> 00:35:11.721]  They are just every week cutting us off, cutting us off, cutting us off, cutting us off.
[00:35:12.081 --> 00:35:17.566]  And using as the example that we used Ron Paul as a source.
[00:35:18.749 --> 00:35:28.937]  On his own TV show out of Houston, syndicated across the country, totally respected by the left and the right, saying he's not credible because it backed up our earlier claims.
[00:35:29.217 --> 00:35:31.939]  What, videos of the rebels firing chemical attacks before?
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:38.505]  Ron Paul listing with his host the UN report saying it was the rebels?
[00:35:39.185 --> 00:35:41.007]  I mean, that's in mainstream news!
[00:35:41.607 --> 00:35:43.348]  We've got all the headlines right here saying
[00:35:44.537 --> 00:35:46.718]  Syrian chemical attack fabricated Assad.
[00:35:46.758 --> 00:35:47.679]  That's the clip we played.
[00:35:47.699 --> 00:35:48.379]  We played it earlier.
[00:35:48.399 --> 00:35:50.720]  Putin's saying they're planning more.
[00:35:52.001 --> 00:36:02.646]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's what's so incredible about this, is they say, we're not allowed to show you what Assad said, but everybody else is.
[00:36:03.606 --> 00:36:05.887]  Because again, it backs up what we previously said.
[00:36:06.127 --> 00:36:08.648]  Because we've been proven right is why you're not allowed to see us.
[00:36:08.688 --> 00:36:09.329]  So in closing,
[00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:11.089]  There's big world news.
[00:36:11.149 --> 00:36:12.050]  Paul's going to cover it all.
[00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:15.433]  But understand, we're not just some side group getting censored.
[00:36:15.493 --> 00:36:17.374]  This is the main tip of the spear.
[00:36:17.835 --> 00:36:20.537]  This is a big deal that we have the internal Google documents.
[00:36:20.617 --> 00:36:32.808]  And Google sits there and watches their employees and watches their contractors and how they vote, surveilling them beyond the NSA and ordering them on how to go downvote things.
[00:36:34.127 --> 00:36:53.653]  And then talking about how credible they are, and how good they are, and how they're protecting the public, and how they've got quotes in here about, in the general elliptical, even if something is based in facts, let me show that to you, in the general elliptical, even if something is based in facts, you need to go ahead and ban it.
[00:36:54.433 --> 00:36:58.895]  I mean, this is the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my life.
[00:37:00.789 --> 00:37:15.243]  Imagine, even if it's accurate, in the general elliptical... Why doesn't Communist China call it elliptical when they execute Buddhists for no reason, or have mobile execution vans, or, you know, kill Christians in gulags?
[00:37:15.543 --> 00:37:19.627]  Well, in the general elliptical of China, it's okay for the greater good.
[00:37:19.687 --> 00:37:20.408]  That's what it means.
[00:37:21.209 --> 00:37:25.613]  They say in the general elliptical, even if what we're saying is true,
[00:37:29.218 --> 00:37:31.612]  In the larger, more elliptical sense of the term.
[00:37:33.735 --> 00:37:37.918]  I mean, these people are unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:38.618 --> 00:37:40.139]  They lied and said Hillary's going to win.
[00:37:40.199 --> 00:37:41.280]  They put out fake polls.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.641]  Google admittedly gamed the search engines.
[00:37:44.282 --> 00:37:46.803]  Alright, Paul Joseph Watson is taking over.
[00:37:47.344 --> 00:37:57.771]  I just want to say in closing, if you do not spread our links, if you do not support us, if you do not contact Congress, if we do not make a big deal out of this, then we're going to be strangled, and you're going to be strangled politically.
[00:37:57.931 --> 00:38:01.373]  They're sick of Infowars being able to break big stories and have Congress cover it.
[00:38:01.613 --> 00:38:06.960]  They've admitted on MSNBC and CNN they're pissed that you were able to set the agenda through this focal point.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:13.648]  They're pissed that Drudge is able to actually break through and actually have some other talking points that aren't George Soros's in the media.
[00:38:14.434 --> 00:38:15.774]  So you want us to fight, we're doing it.
[00:38:16.835 --> 00:38:20.056]  In closing, we're extending Easter specials through tomorrow.
[00:38:20.596 --> 00:38:33.160]  We have massive specials, 30% off super high quality nootropics like Rainforce, Super Mel Vitality, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Vitamin B12, Secret 12, Survival Shield X2, high quality nascent iodine that is running out.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.204]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:38:38.264 --> 00:38:47.213]  Ladies and gentlemen, the New World Order is coming after us because we are game changers and are having a big effect.
[00:38:47.393 --> 00:38:48.254]  I know you know that.
[00:38:48.474 --> 00:38:50.476]  But follow us on Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[00:38:50.877 --> 00:38:52.058]  Retweet everything we do.
[00:38:52.678 --> 00:38:55.540]  Take everything we have on Facebook and send it out to everyone you know.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.661]  Copy our videos to your YouTube channels.
[00:38:57.961 --> 00:38:58.721]  Start your own.
[00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:00.102]  Start a local radio show.
[00:39:00.282 --> 00:39:01.142]  Promote free speech.
[00:39:01.202 --> 00:39:02.403]  Just get active.
[00:39:02.463 --> 00:39:03.203]  Get involved.
[00:39:03.523 --> 00:39:06.685]  Soros and his big mobs are out everywhere trying to bully people.
[00:39:07.125 --> 00:39:08.086]  Be like Mike Cernovich.
[00:39:08.166 --> 00:39:16.830]  Go down, get on the open mic, and scream, Bill Clinton's a rapist because he didn't settle rape cases, and these people are frauds, and it's time to stand up against them.
[00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:20.851]  I want to thank Mike Cernovich and his sources for getting us this key intel.
[00:39:21.331 --> 00:39:22.551]  This is a big, big story.
[00:39:22.632 --> 00:39:23.492]  It affects everybody.
[00:39:23.752 --> 00:39:25.272]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:39:25.592 --> 00:39:27.773]  And I'm asking everybody to hang together or hang separate.
[00:39:28.033 --> 00:39:36.575]  As Benjamin Franklin said, if you don't financially support us and get great products you need, if you don't spread the links, if you don't share the link InfoWars.com forward slash show, they win.
[00:39:37.035 --> 00:39:39.536]  They're already pushing us down in the search ranks.
[00:39:39.776 --> 00:39:42.417]  They're already putting all the garbage and lies up there on top.
[00:39:42.697 --> 00:39:47.221]  They're already going into high gear because we are having an ultra-massive effect.
[00:39:47.702 --> 00:39:51.485]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA253-3139.
[00:39:52.045 --> 00:39:58.191]  If you've never bought products from us before, now is the time to get a gravity-fed filter, the highest rated, 40% off.
[00:39:59.472 --> 00:40:03.417]  Now is the time to get a Trump is my president shirt just for free speech exercise.
[00:40:03.717 --> 00:40:05.559]  Now is the time to buy some heirloom seeds.
[00:40:05.839 --> 00:40:06.660]  Now is the time.
[00:40:07.341 --> 00:40:10.485]  Only 1% of you end up actually monetarily supporting us.
[00:40:10.505 --> 00:40:11.266]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:40:11.506 --> 00:40:13.688]  It's great we built a major system to fight them.
[00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:14.649]  That's why they're coming after us.
[00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:17.072]  But imagine if we're beating them with one finger.
[00:40:17.993 --> 00:40:23.615]  If you actually stand up and start supporting us and aggressively spreading the links, nothing will stop you.
[00:40:24.396 --> 00:40:26.136]  So again, I want to thank you all for what you're doing.
[00:40:26.156 --> 00:40:26.997]  This is so historic.
[00:40:27.017 --> 00:40:28.937]  I'm so honored to be here with this amazing crew.
[00:40:29.438 --> 00:40:35.420]  And in closing, please pray for us because God is in charge and this is an epic historical battle happening right now.
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.862]  Okay, Paul's gonna be here for the next two and a half, three hours.
[00:40:37.882 --> 00:40:39.823]  He can go to the fourth hour.
[00:40:39.863 --> 00:40:40.744]  The other host is coming up.
[00:40:40.904 --> 00:40:41.845]  Big, big shows.
[00:40:42.325 --> 00:40:43.926]  And I got a lot of other big issues.
[00:40:43.946 --> 00:40:45.487]  I'm fighting on the same front.
[00:40:45.708 --> 00:40:47.129]  The enemy has hit me from every side.
[00:40:47.609 --> 00:40:49.290]  And it's because we're so effective.
[00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:50.591]  So again, thank you all for your prayers.
[00:40:50.852 --> 00:40:52.433]  Now to Paul Watson in the other studio.
[00:40:54.494 --> 00:40:55.214]  And we are live.
[00:40:55.254 --> 00:40:57.755]  It's April 17th, 2017.
[00:40:58.135 --> 00:41:01.796]  I am Paul Joseph Watson, live in studio in Austin.
[00:41:01.816 --> 00:41:05.557]  We have an absolutely massive, gem-packed show to come.
[00:41:05.658 --> 00:41:11.819]  The New York Times has come out, and we're going to get into this later, and said that Trump now needs to support ISIS.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:18.341]  He actively needs to encourage ISIS, of course, two weeks after they bombed Assad, after they bombed the airfield.
[00:41:18.922 --> 00:41:22.743]  Absolutely insane editorial out of the New York Times, so we're going to cover that.
[00:41:23.263 --> 00:41:25.364]  We're going to cover the battle of Berkeley.
[00:41:25.404 --> 00:41:32.306]  Of course you had the first battle of Berkeley, where women were pepper sprayed in the face, where people were beaten with flagpoles.
[00:41:32.806 --> 00:41:33.606]  You all saw that.
[00:41:34.247 --> 00:41:38.928]  Most of you probably saw what happened this past weekend, but we're going to delve into that even more.
[00:41:39.368 --> 00:41:44.310]  The French election is coming up on April 23rd, just six days away.
[00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:50.692]  From the first round of the French election, Marine Le Pen is being completely sabotaged.
[00:41:50.732 --> 00:41:57.494]  Of course, she is the anti-globalist candidate as this populist wave revolution sweeps the West.
[00:41:57.915 --> 00:42:04.417]  They're now handing out ballots to 500,000 people who live outside of France.
[00:42:04.817 --> 00:42:06.898]  They're handing out two ballots.
[00:42:07.538 --> 00:42:11.319]  Most people who live outside of France aren't going to support Marine Le Pen.
[00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:17.321]  But they're going to get two ballots, and the police have said, oh, we don't really care, we'll investigate it after the election.
[00:42:17.761 --> 00:42:22.322]  That could turn the entire election in France, and nobody really cares about it.
[00:42:22.682 --> 00:42:23.762]  So we're going to get into that.
[00:42:24.162 --> 00:42:27.103]  Two huge guests coming up in the next hour.
[00:42:27.163 --> 00:42:32.825]  We have Lionel, the scholarly take that he always has on current affairs, so we look forward to that.
[00:42:32.865 --> 00:42:34.025]  Of course, he is a radio host.
[00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:45.068]  At LionelMedia.com and we have Mike Cernovich to break down, as Alex just explained, the most egregious form of censorship that we have faced to date.
[00:42:45.568 --> 00:42:51.870]  This is not just about Facebook blocking our links, saying that we're spam, you know, shadow banning on Twitter.
[00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.151]  This is even worse because this is Google.
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:58.003]  And Google is basically the Internet at this point.
[00:42:58.444 --> 00:43:02.268]  So are we going to get into the arguments about, oh, it's a private company, they can do what they want?
[00:43:02.849 --> 00:43:03.369]  No, they can't.
[00:43:03.409 --> 00:43:04.190]  They're a monopoly.
[00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:06.232]  They basically are the Internet at this point.
[00:43:06.613 --> 00:43:14.962]  Now they're openly relegating InfoWars links to delist them, to prevent them from appearing near the top of the page, of course.
[00:43:15.703 --> 00:43:17.404]  We saw this coming a few weeks ago.
[00:43:17.444 --> 00:43:21.828]  We had a story about Google delisting criticism of Islam.
[00:43:22.228 --> 00:43:31.956]  So you had websites that merely pointed to quotations, direct quotations out of the Quran about Islam not being a religion of peace.
[00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:34.318]  That was deemed hateful.
[00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:36.239]  That was delisted.
[00:43:36.479 --> 00:43:43.465]  That was buried on page 4 of Google search results when you type in Islam violence Quran.
[00:43:44.773 --> 00:43:51.316]  There you see the article from March 17th, Google to target criticism of Islam in new censorship purge.
[00:43:51.896 --> 00:44:08.062]  And the example they gave was a website, I think it was put up by a former congresswoman or somebody who was politically active, somebody who was a public figure, an analyst, simply going through passages in the Quran saying, kill all the infidels, this is violent.
[00:44:08.142 --> 00:44:11.924]  No, you can't say that on your own website, you will be delisted on Google.
[00:44:12.364 --> 00:44:15.807]  Now they're doing it to Infowars wholesale.
[00:44:16.207 --> 00:44:19.069]  And Mike Cernovich has got the inside source on that.
[00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:22.412]  He came to us with that monumental story last night.
[00:44:22.732 --> 00:44:24.073]  He's going to break it down further.
[00:44:24.393 --> 00:44:26.935]  We're going to get into the true agenda behind that.
[00:44:27.236 --> 00:44:28.857]  How we can fight back against it.
[00:44:29.878 --> 00:44:32.760]  But I want to talk about the situation in Cleveland first because
[00:44:34.076 --> 00:44:38.760]  You probably have seen the video by now, most of you, on Facebook or on Twitter.
[00:44:39.061 --> 00:44:40.462]  Absolutely harrowing.
[00:44:40.542 --> 00:44:42.724]  If you haven't seen the video, don't.
[00:44:42.904 --> 00:44:44.226]  It's not worth watching it.
[00:44:44.506 --> 00:44:45.767]  It will chill you to the core.
[00:44:46.508 --> 00:44:51.312]  And we have an article out of Axios Murder in Cleveland, Facebook's latest fiasco.
[00:44:52.313 --> 00:44:53.594]  And this guy's still at large.
[00:44:53.654 --> 00:45:06.401]  Cleveland Police said on Sunday that a manhunt was underway after a man uploaded a video of himself killing someone to Facebook, then going on Facebook Live and claiming to have committed multiple other homicides which are yet to be verified.
[00:45:06.881 --> 00:45:15.526]  Thankfully, the only fatality that we know about so far is this one poor old guy who was collecting tin cans.
[00:45:16.086 --> 00:45:17.747]  He's obviously, you know, down on his luck.
[00:45:18.247 --> 00:45:18.668]  Old guy.
[00:45:19.724 --> 00:45:29.470]  This lunatic walks up to him, says, mention the name of what I presume to be his former lover or whatever, just shoots him in the face.
[00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:32.492]  Absolutely senseless, chilling.
[00:45:32.992 --> 00:45:34.873]  People talk about the mundaneness of evil.
[00:45:35.133 --> 00:45:43.258]  You know, you can watch ISIS beheading videos when they break in the news, and at least, you know, there's some kind of narrative that you can pin on it.
[00:45:43.658 --> 00:45:44.959]  No matter how twisted.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:58.510]  Whereas this, absolutely, totally senseless, just walks up on a poor black guy collecting tin cans to sell for recycling, shoots him in the head, uploads it to Facebook.
[00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:04.454]  Now what they're claiming is that this is Facebook's fault and we basically need to ban Facebook Live.
[00:46:04.494 --> 00:46:05.615]  The article continues.
[00:46:06.596 --> 00:46:14.300]  Facebook was unable to pull the live broadcast down in real time and failed to remove the killing video for several hours after the fact.
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.861]  So now we have to ban Facebook Live.
[00:46:16.901 --> 00:46:20.602]  The suspect, Steve Stevens, is still at large.
[00:46:20.662 --> 00:46:23.364]  They're saying now he's probably left the Cleveland area.
[00:46:24.384 --> 00:46:27.845]  A quote from the article, Facebook Live Worst Case Has Happened.
[00:46:28.265 --> 00:46:34.406]  Facebook has to decide if it wants to continue with it, knowing risk to reputation and public safety.
[00:46:34.667 --> 00:46:44.489]  So now they're saying, let's not explore why this is happening, let's just ban Facebook Live, even though the video wasn't even uploaded or live-streamed on Facebook Live.
[00:46:44.529 --> 00:46:45.909]  It was uploaded after the fact.
[00:46:46.549 --> 00:46:48.870]  But CNN covered this story yesterday.
[00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:58.621]  Hours after it broke, and this is an article out of the Ralph Report, CNN refuses to call Cleveland shooter Steve Stevens black as he continues shooting up Cleveland.
[00:46:59.282 --> 00:47:04.228]  Now to be clear, this has not got a racial dimension so far that we know of.
[00:47:05.017 --> 00:47:06.919]  The suspect is black.
[00:47:07.119 --> 00:47:11.524]  His victim, that we saw callously gunned down on camera, is also black.
[00:47:12.004 --> 00:47:13.986]  So it has nothing to do with race.
[00:47:14.186 --> 00:47:15.848]  It's not a Black Lives Matter thing.
[00:47:15.868 --> 00:47:18.130]  It doesn't look like there's any relation to Islam.
[00:47:18.931 --> 00:47:24.416]  So people on the right, conservatives, didn't make it about race because there's no evidence for it being about race.
[00:47:25.137 --> 00:47:29.318]  People on the left made it all about race almost immediately.
[00:47:29.798 --> 00:47:34.899]  CNN put up a black silhouette, and I think it's in this article if you can find it.
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.220]  We knew the identity of this guy, we knew what he looked like.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:43.241]  He streamed his face, he uploaded a video of his face onto Facebook.
[00:47:43.642 --> 00:47:48.363]  His identity was known, his name was known, and yet CNN put that up.
[00:47:48.923 --> 00:47:53.004]  They didn't say he was black, they didn't even put a picture of him up.
[00:47:53.925 --> 00:47:54.645]  Why is that?
[00:47:54.905 --> 00:48:04.208]  This guy's roaming around Cleveland and God knows where else now, claiming that he's killed people, threatening to kill more people for no reason whatsoever.
[00:48:04.588 --> 00:48:05.709]  We know what he looks like.
[00:48:06.129 --> 00:48:11.870]  People are deserting the streets, and yet CNN daren't even show his face.
[00:48:13.031 --> 00:48:15.111]  Would they show his face if he was white?
[00:48:15.231 --> 00:48:15.732]  Probably.
[00:48:16.552 --> 00:48:17.032]  Probably.
[00:48:18.766 --> 00:48:41.052]  They always get very excited when there's a mass shooting and it's linked to white supremacism, but if there's any question whatsoever, and there isn't at this point, but any question whatsoever that this could be Black Lives Matter related, they shut the narrative down to the point where they don't even display the guy who callously gunned down this poor old man.
[00:48:41.772 --> 00:48:41.952]  Again,
[00:48:43.044 --> 00:48:44.646]  Refusing to call him black.
[00:48:45.026 --> 00:48:47.649]  Preventing him from being caught.
[00:48:47.909 --> 00:48:53.634]  If somebody had seen this, then they had seen the killer in person, they wouldn't know what he looked like.
[00:48:54.454 --> 00:49:03.097]  Meanwhile, D-Ray, D-Ray McKesson, one of the icons, one of the leaders of Black Lives Matter, was tweeting about gelato.
[00:49:03.997 --> 00:49:10.100]  He wasn't interested in this because, of course, black lives don't matter when it's black-on-black violence.
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:18.983]  They don't want to make that part of the conversation, despite the fact that, you know, 90% of black murders are committed by other black men.
[00:49:19.557 --> 00:49:23.279]  And that has to be part of the conversation if Black Lives Matter.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:35.888]  But instead, Tariq Nasheed, another Black Lives Matter supporter on Twitter, an anti-racism strategist, whose every other tweet is basically race-obsessed,
[00:49:36.488 --> 00:49:45.859]  Said, quote, and this was a tweet yesterday, some of these white supremacists in Cleveland might use that Facebook killer as an excuse to shoot random black people.
[00:49:46.259 --> 00:49:47.721]  So be careful out there.
[00:49:48.262 --> 00:49:52.486]  So his primary concern was not finding the culprit.
[00:49:53.439 --> 00:49:57.461]  Who had just shot dead another black man and uploaded it to Facebook.
[00:49:57.501 --> 00:49:59.502]  His primary concern was not that.
[00:49:59.742 --> 00:50:02.404]  Despite him having a large audience on Twitter, no.
[00:50:02.464 --> 00:50:06.446]  His primary concern was to talk about white supremacism.
[00:50:08.487 --> 00:50:12.970]  Absolutely no racial dimension whatsoever, yet that was his main concern.
[00:50:14.247 --> 00:50:18.631]  Absolutely insane, and they're all over Twitter with this kind of attitude.
[00:50:19.271 --> 00:50:25.856]  Breitbart reports on a related subject, gun-controlled Chicago, 29 people shot in under 18 hours.
[00:50:26.497 --> 00:50:29.279]  Again, this is not going to be part of the conversation.
[00:50:31.619 --> 00:50:34.161]  90% of black murders are black-on-black crime.
[00:50:34.681 --> 00:50:43.108]  We have 29 people shot in just the last 18 hours alone in Chicago, and it's not part of the conversation.
[00:50:43.848 --> 00:50:48.372]  CNN is refusing to even show an image of this guy.
[00:50:48.812 --> 00:50:52.495]  We'll be back live on the Alex Jones Show with more huge breaking news.
[00:50:52.555 --> 00:50:53.116]  Don't go away.
[00:51:03.149 --> 00:51:05.070]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:06.190]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:07.371]  Why is this so good?
[00:51:07.651 --> 00:51:12.892]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:51:12.973 --> 00:51:26.537]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:51:26.577 --> 00:51:27.978]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:51:28.878 --> 00:51:30.340]  Spreading disease around.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.883]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:51:32.983 --> 00:51:34.245]  These are all parasites.
[00:51:34.285 --> 00:51:35.386]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:51:35.406 --> 00:51:36.427]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:51:36.748 --> 00:51:41.073]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:51:41.293 --> 00:51:44.457]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:51:44.517 --> 00:51:47.598]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:51:47.638 --> 00:51:48.638]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:51:48.698 --> 00:51:50.579]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:51:50.639 --> 00:51:51.659]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:51:51.679 --> 00:51:53.760]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.401]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[00:51:57.661 --> 00:51:59.541]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:51:59.921 --> 00:52:01.882]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:52:03.214 --> 00:52:04.294]  Want to stop progress?
[00:52:04.554 --> 00:52:06.335]  Contact your local Progressive Democrat.
[00:52:06.535 --> 00:52:12.096]  With Airbnb rising in popularity, the hotel industry is freaking out, and Progressive Democrats are responding.
[00:52:12.356 --> 00:52:17.937]  First, the Federal Trade Commission requested an investigation be done into how Airbnb was affecting the housing market.
[00:52:18.117 --> 00:52:25.499]  Why waste our money on that, I'm not sure, but Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo signed a bill making it a finable offense to post on Airbnb.
[00:52:25.859 --> 00:52:29.703]  Another example of the government getting involved in private business where it doesn't belong.
[00:52:29.944 --> 00:52:36.351]  If you violate a lease, that is between you and your leaseholder, but now the government has a preemptive strike against the Airbnb host.
[00:52:36.571 --> 00:52:40.976]  You can be sure this is a result of the hotel industry lobbying our fine politicians.
[00:52:41.357 --> 00:52:44.080]  Linda Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the bill,
[00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:49.623]  ...said, this sets a standard for those struggling with the impact of Airbnb on affordable housing.
[00:52:49.803 --> 00:52:53.705]  Which doesn't even make sense because innovation and competition always lowers costs.
[00:52:53.905 --> 00:52:55.866]  But these are Democrats we're talking about here.
[00:52:56.046 --> 00:52:58.087]  So don't bother trying to progress an industry.
[00:52:58.288 --> 00:53:00.389]  Progressive Democrats are waiting to stop you.
[00:53:00.569 --> 00:53:02.650]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:04.431]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:53:04.712 --> 00:53:05.993]  You can't survive without it.
[00:53:06.193 --> 00:53:07.094]  But where do you get it?
[00:53:07.394 --> 00:53:13.160]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:19.126]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:53:19.286 --> 00:53:36.151]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:53:36.551 --> 00:53:38.671]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:53:39.052 --> 00:53:40.252]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:53:40.512 --> 00:53:41.272]  Easy assembly.
[00:53:41.552 --> 00:53:42.172]  Low maintenance.
[00:53:42.472 --> 00:53:44.272]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:54:05.573 --> 00:54:11.898]  The preacher man says it's the end of time, in the Mississippi River she's a gold drive.
[00:54:16.862 --> 00:54:22.827]  The interest is up and the stock market's down, and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[00:54:26.934 --> 00:54:29.856]  We have breaking news up on the Drudge Report.
[00:54:29.876 --> 00:54:31.177]  It's the top headline right now.
[00:54:31.217 --> 00:54:41.985]  This is interesting because I got on a plane on Saturday morning, Saturday afternoon, with China warning that war with North Korea, between North Korea and the US, could be imminent.
[00:54:42.465 --> 00:54:44.587]  Got on a plane with no internet connection.
[00:54:45.307 --> 00:54:47.609]  Landed thinking that that could have started.
[00:54:47.649 --> 00:54:48.609]  Thankfully it didn't.
[00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:50.751]  Of course, we had the failed missile test.
[00:54:51.111 --> 00:54:54.554]  A lot of speculation over cyber hacking as to the cause of that.
[00:54:55.478 --> 00:55:04.280]  Now the BBC is reporting, this is up on drudgereport.com, North Korea will test missiles weekly, senior official tells BBC.
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:14.662]  The article goes on to say North Korea will continue to test missiles despite international condemnation and increasing military tensions with the US, a senior official has told the BBC in Pyongyang.
[00:55:15.242 --> 00:55:19.163]  We'll be conducting more missile tests on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis.
[00:55:20.003 --> 00:55:28.512]  Vice Foreign Minister Hang Song-Rail told the BBC's John Sudworth, he said that, quote, an all-out war would result if the US took military action.
[00:55:29.012 --> 00:55:32.015]  So again, is it bellicose rhetoric?
[00:55:32.376 --> 00:55:38.842]  We know that Trump, we know that the United States has basically indicated there will be some form of military attack.
[00:55:39.543 --> 00:55:45.489]  Experts even suggesting an attack on the Yongbong nuclear plant there in North Korea.
[00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:55.639]  If they test another missile, certainly if there's a sixth nuclear test, then that will provoke a massive backlash, a massive response.
[00:55:55.679 --> 00:55:58.542]  So these tensions continue to escalate over North Korea.
[00:55:59.423 --> 00:56:01.905]  And again, most people don't seem to be factoring in the fact that
[00:56:02.958 --> 00:56:09.402]  If they're attacked, they will immediately launch artillery, battery weapons into South Korea.
[00:56:09.683 --> 00:56:11.604]  That could escalate extremely quickly.
[00:56:11.884 --> 00:56:15.606]  You're talking about at least a million people dead.
[00:56:16.467 --> 00:56:21.190]  And those estimates were from 10-15 years ago, so it's probably even more now.
[00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:27.735]  We had Japan evacuating, or at least planning to evacuate their citizens from South Korea.
[00:56:27.835 --> 00:56:32.178]  We had reports that people in Pyongyang, North Koreans, were being evacuated.
[00:56:33.219 --> 00:56:34.161]  This is not over.
[00:56:34.281 --> 00:56:35.484]  This is only going to build again.
[00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:38.391]  North Korea has repeatedly tested these missiles.
[00:56:38.431 --> 00:56:41.097]  There's nothing to suggest they're not going to keep doing that.
[00:56:42.148 --> 00:56:45.230]  But of course the effect it's had domestically in the U.S.
[00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:48.613]  is this out of Rasmussen, also up on the Judge Report.
[00:56:48.913 --> 00:56:51.495]  Trump's approval rating hits 50%.
[00:56:52.055 --> 00:57:06.946]  Bearing in mind it was 59% immediately after the inauguration, then it started to plummet as we saw Rasmussen, which is normally quite friendly to Trump in terms of poll numbers, had him down to 42% at the lowest point.
[00:57:07.047 --> 00:57:08.448]  Gallup had him lower than that.
[00:57:09.108 --> 00:57:13.870]  Now, as a result of these war drums beating, he's back up to 50%.
[00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:23.194]  But what's key is when you drill down into these stats, and this is an article up on Zero Hedge which talks about it, headlined, War Works!
[00:57:23.294 --> 00:57:29.277]  Trump Favorability Hits 50% Highest in 2 Months, and they go a bit deeper than Rasmussen.
[00:57:29.297 --> 00:57:31.658]  They drill into it and find that if you ask people,
[00:57:32.697 --> 00:57:34.399]  Did Trump keep his promises?
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.348]  If you ask people on February 1st to 5th if Trump kept his promises, 62% said yes.
[00:57:42.009 --> 00:57:46.575]  But now, April 5th to 9th, has Trump kept his promises?
[00:57:48.132 --> 00:57:49.834]  45% say yes.
[00:57:49.894 --> 00:57:50.915]  So it's down by 17%.
[00:57:52.197 --> 00:57:53.718]  You can see the other barometers.
[00:57:54.279 --> 00:57:56.622]  If you scroll down a little further there into that article.
[00:57:57.343 --> 00:57:59.085]  Is Trump a strong and decisive leader?
[00:57:59.165 --> 00:58:00.947]  Even that has dropped 7 points.
[00:58:01.027 --> 00:58:02.970]  Can he bring about changes this country needs?
[00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:04.151]  That has dropped 7 points.
[00:58:05.012 --> 00:58:14.558]  So when you actually get into the nitty gritty, into the details, this doesn't make good reading, but generally speaking, his approval rating has gone up to 50%.
[00:58:14.938 --> 00:58:16.940]  We're going to get into that with Lionel.
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:26.826]  We're going to talk about Syria and North Korea, as well as Google censorship, delisting of Infowars.com, huge issues coming up.
[00:58:27.046 --> 00:58:31.369]  We're also going to get into the Battle of Berkeley and what happened with Antifa.
[00:58:31.869 --> 00:58:35.814]  This is the Alex Jones Show live breaking news at Infowars.com.
[00:58:35.834 --> 00:58:36.375]  We'll be back.
[00:58:43.565 --> 00:58:45.387]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:49.293]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:54.116 --> 00:58:57.698]  I'm going to commit blasphemy against the globalists right now in the New World Order.
[00:58:58.599 --> 00:59:11.308]  I'm going to tell all of you that we're celebrating the Christian holiday of Easter, Our Risen Christ, on the third day by having some of the biggest specials ever at InfoWarsTore.com on amazing supplements.
[00:59:11.748 --> 00:59:21.214]  You know, mainstream media demonizes us for selling high-quality organic supplements that are game changers, while they have all the poison Big Pharma drug ads all day sitting there poisoning the people.
[00:59:21.514 --> 00:59:23.936]  What a shameful group of wicked devils.
[00:59:24.376 --> 00:59:28.797]  Ladies and gentlemen, our Christ raised from the dead on the third day.
[00:59:29.937 --> 00:59:36.739]  And our republic can rise from the dead if we wake up to what the globalists are doing and if you support independent free media.
[00:59:37.159 --> 00:59:41.500]  There's never been a better time to support InfoWars with these specials at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:43.240]  Because it's all about life.
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:51.442]  Get the products, whether it's water filtration, nutraceuticals, Patriot apparel, you name it, it's all available at InfoWarsStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:59:55.208 --> 00:59:59.310]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:01.171]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.338 --> 01:00:19.400]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.582]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:32.751 --> 01:00:34.733]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:34.753 --> 01:00:40.617]  We have Lionel coming up in the next segment with his scholarly analytical take on current affairs.
[01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:44.240]  We're going to delve back into the North Korea news in a moment.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.743]  We have more escalation, more tension in the region.
[01:00:47.763 --> 01:00:53.047]  We're going to talk about the French election, the first round of which is coming up here in six days time.
[01:00:53.347 --> 01:01:01.394]  Can Marine Le Pen come out on top and get that momentum that will take her into the second round, give her a chance of victory?
[01:01:02.014 --> 01:01:09.657]  Before we get into that, I want to tell you about the Easter Mega Specials extended at InfoWarsStore.com for a limited time only.
[01:01:09.677 --> 01:01:14.479]  As you heard from Alex at the start of the show, we're under constant barrage.
[01:01:14.999 --> 01:01:22.042]  The intensification of these attacks has never been more sustained, more intense than it is right now.
[01:01:22.623 --> 01:01:24.363]  We depend on your support more than ever.
[01:01:24.383 --> 01:01:25.464]  That's not a cliche.
[01:01:26.344 --> 01:01:28.666]  It's this getting really down to the wire now.
[01:01:29.126 --> 01:01:30.627]  The red line is being crossed.
[01:01:31.048 --> 01:01:33.289]  They're targeting us financially.
[01:01:33.810 --> 01:01:36.472]  So we have the extended specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:01:36.712 --> 01:01:38.973]  We have 30% off Brain Force.
[01:01:40.014 --> 01:01:42.396]  I just popped two of these about 30 minutes ago again.
[01:01:43.036 --> 01:01:44.878]  Jet lagged, two hours sleep.
[01:01:46.155 --> 01:01:47.216]  That's going to pick you up.
[01:01:47.276 --> 01:01:48.737]  That's going to give you mental clarity.
[01:01:49.057 --> 01:01:55.301]  Brain Force Plus, the new formula, 30% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:01:55.942 --> 01:01:58.423]  Again, mental acuity, mental clarity.
[01:01:59.064 --> 01:02:00.425]  It's not a speedy effect.
[01:02:00.465 --> 01:02:01.725]  It's not a junky effect.
[01:02:02.246 --> 01:02:03.407]  It just pushes you through.
[01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:09.471]  And especially if you're hosting a three-hour radio show with massive bright lights shining on your face with two hours sleep.
[01:02:10.191 --> 01:02:11.292]  That is a huge help.
[01:02:11.793 --> 01:02:17.939]  So for any task like that, any intensive task, brain force is going to be an absolute wonder for you.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:19.520]  30% off.
[01:02:20.081 --> 01:02:21.502]  That special is extended.
[01:02:21.542 --> 01:02:21.902]  We have.
[01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:25.291]  25% off Supermail Vitality.
[01:02:25.991 --> 01:02:30.293]  And we have here another 5-star review which was posted on Infowarsstore.com.
[01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:33.194]  Again, independent 5-star review.
[01:02:33.254 --> 01:02:35.814]  Supermail Vitality blew me away.
[01:02:36.335 --> 01:02:36.695]  Wow!
[01:02:37.155 --> 01:02:46.018]  After dabbling in herbology for the last several years, I know that supplements like these are usually diluted and that only quality products get real results.
[01:02:46.078 --> 01:02:48.399]  This is an independent review of Supermail Vitality.
[01:02:49.119 --> 01:02:55.170]  I've been wanting to try this super male vitality for a while, and with the confidence I have in Alex Jones, if he says it works, then it does.
[01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:58.332]  No lie, this supplement is powerful.
[01:02:58.392 --> 01:02:59.993]  What an incredible feeling this gives.
[01:03:00.433 --> 01:03:06.917]  I can only describe it as focus and happiness with a side of high quality energy without jitters.
[01:03:07.618 --> 01:03:09.219]  And that's what we hear over and over again.
[01:03:09.299 --> 01:03:11.661]  This isn't a junkie speed-like feeling.
[01:03:12.241 --> 01:03:20.126]  Like I used to take a different nootropic similar to Brain Force and that kind of gave you a, you know, the heart racing feeling which you really don't want.
[01:03:21.067 --> 01:03:22.229]  Brainforce doesn't do that.
[01:03:22.289 --> 01:03:23.912]  Supermail Vitality doesn't do that.
[01:03:23.992 --> 01:03:28.979]  We have 25% off with the special extended at infowarsstore.com.
[01:03:30.185 --> 01:03:43.557]  Vitamin, Mineral Fusion 25% off, Secret 12, Vitamin B12 25% off, Super Female Vitality also 25% off, as is Survival Shield X2, and many others at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:03:43.878 --> 01:03:45.940]  Again, five-star independent reviews.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:55.468]  We depend on your support now more than ever, as we are under constant assault by the establishment on a daily basis.
[01:03:56.707 --> 01:04:00.390]  Lionel's coming up, let's hit a couple of news stories in the final minute of this segment.
[01:04:01.471 --> 01:04:05.595]  Era of strategic patience by US towards North Korea is over.
[01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:08.997]  That's Mike Pence, who of course is in South Korea right now.
[01:04:09.418 --> 01:04:15.183]  He announced the quote, end of strategic patience towards Pyongyang, adding that all options are on the table.
[01:04:15.523 --> 01:04:20.868]  Pence spoke on Monday while visiting the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.
[01:04:21.528 --> 01:04:30.416]  And Zero Hedge reports on top of that, Trump considering kinetic military action on North Korea, including sudden strike.
[01:04:30.976 --> 01:04:33.138]  So there's not going to be any warning whatsoever.
[01:04:33.198 --> 01:04:36.882]  This is the main contention that South Korea and Japan have got.
[01:04:37.342 --> 01:04:42.427]  They said to Trump, if you're going to strike North Korea, you have to talk to us first.
[01:04:42.967 --> 01:04:45.269]  Now it looks like that is not going to happen.
[01:04:45.889 --> 01:04:52.053]  If there is a strike, it will be a complete surprise to North Korea, to South Korea, to Japan, to everyone.
[01:04:52.553 --> 01:04:55.095]  And how quickly will that escalate tensions in the region?
[01:04:55.415 --> 01:04:59.137]  We'll continue to track it, but we will be back in the next segment with Lionel.
[01:04:59.617 --> 01:05:00.678]  BreakingNewsInfoWars.com.
[01:05:00.798 --> 01:05:01.779]  Don't go away.
[01:05:03.803 --> 01:05:04.884]  You have no money?
[01:05:05.144 --> 01:05:07.106]  This is okay, we will take your blood.
[01:05:07.386 --> 01:05:12.731]  If you want access to the Vatican Museums, cash, visa, MasterCard or needle is accepted.
[01:05:13.051 --> 01:05:16.394]  That's right, you can give blood to access the Vatican Museum.
[01:05:16.654 --> 01:05:21.158]  The blood payment plan has a slogan, give blood and follow your artistic inclination.
[01:05:21.438 --> 01:05:24.701]  Blood donors then receive a voucher which gives them access to the museums.
[01:05:25.062 --> 01:05:28.665]  The director of the Vatican Museum said, without blood there is no life.
[01:05:29.145 --> 01:05:31.607]  Without art, life would be empty and sad.
[01:05:32.328 --> 01:05:34.009]  Okay, I love Jesus, too.
[01:05:34.089 --> 01:05:34.790]  Happy Easter!
[01:05:35.490 --> 01:05:36.691]  I guess this is a good idea.
[01:05:37.131 --> 01:05:39.773]  Get some blood donations and allow people access to history.
[01:05:40.074 --> 01:05:40.734]  Sounds harmless.
[01:05:40.954 --> 01:05:41.395]  But wait!
[01:05:41.815 --> 01:05:44.377]  Each blood donation is good for a four-euro voucher.
[01:05:44.777 --> 01:05:47.159]  It costs sixteen euros to access the museums.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:51.022]  So you have to donate blood four times before you can even get in.
[01:05:51.603 --> 01:05:54.165]  By the time you've given enough blood, you'd have fainted.
[01:05:54.986 --> 01:05:59.053]  Enjoy Michelangelo's Last Judgment as you recover from hypovolemia.
[01:05:59.554 --> 01:06:01.779]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[01:06:04.065 --> 01:06:05.406]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:06:05.646 --> 01:06:10.449]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:13.832]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:06:14.092 --> 01:06:19.455]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:06:19.896 --> 01:06:28.501]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:28.742 --> 01:06:33.825]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:06:34.085 --> 01:06:40.787]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[01:06:41.067 --> 01:06:45.648]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:06:45.788 --> 01:06:48.969]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:50.989]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:06:51.189 --> 01:06:56.511]  Even better, use coupon code POWER at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[01:06:56.791 --> 01:06:58.771]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[01:06:59.071 --> 01:07:00.772]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:09.703]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[01:07:09.863 --> 01:07:10.443]  I take this.
[01:07:10.703 --> 01:07:11.724]  My family takes this.
[01:07:11.824 --> 01:07:16.066]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:07:16.106 --> 01:07:20.548]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:07:20.708 --> 01:07:25.270]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:07:25.350 --> 01:07:26.391]  I don't feel good.
[01:07:26.491 --> 01:07:29.992]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:07:30.233 --> 01:07:32.874]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:07:32.934 --> 01:07:38.256]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:07:38.737 --> 01:07:41.138]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:07:41.698 --> 01:07:45.140]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:47.401]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:07:47.461 --> 01:07:47.821]  I love it.
[01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:50.585]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:07:50.786 --> 01:07:51.767]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:07:51.808 --> 01:07:57.738]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:07:57.758 --> 01:07:59.380]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:07:59.641 --> 01:08:01.664]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[01:08:06.226 --> 01:08:09.250]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:08:09.831 --> 01:08:13.977]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:37.475 --> 01:08:41.658]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show, and we have our guest, Lionel.
[01:08:41.678 --> 01:08:45.841]  We're going to cover a huge gamut of issues over the next 50 minutes or so.
[01:08:46.562 --> 01:08:48.323]  He is a commentator and radio host.
[01:08:48.383 --> 01:08:50.805]  The website is lionelmedia.com.
[01:08:50.825 --> 01:08:54.388]  You can find him on Twitter at Lionel Media.
[01:08:54.448 --> 01:08:55.529]  Lionel, it's been a while.
[01:08:55.589 --> 01:08:56.129]  Welcome back.
[01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:58.551]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[01:08:58.571 --> 01:09:05.156]  And let me just also add, because I'm following in your footsteps, my YouTube channel at Lionel Nation.
[01:09:07.694 --> 01:09:09.375]  Lionel Nation on YouTube.
[01:09:10.016 --> 01:09:10.877]  Go and check that out.
[01:09:11.697 --> 01:09:13.118]  Building his YouTube channel there.
[01:09:13.499 --> 01:09:16.641]  Again, vital to have that reach across all these different platforms.
[01:09:17.042 --> 01:09:27.610]  Lionel, I want to start with North Korea because we were covering the fact that basically Trump has said he won't talk to Japan and South Korea if there is a military attack on North Korea.
[01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:32.875]  They have said all along, before anything happens, you need to talk to us first.
[01:09:32.975 --> 01:09:35.117]  That looks like it's not going to happen.
[01:09:35.777 --> 01:09:44.086]  We have it tied in with the Syria narrative, you know, that Trump was right to bomb Assad in Syria, that that sent a strong message to North Korea.
[01:09:44.386 --> 01:09:46.268]  It seems to have worked, at least domestically.
[01:09:46.308 --> 01:09:48.310]  His poll number is back up to 50%.
[01:09:49.031 --> 01:09:55.878]  Do you think the two issues of North Korea and Syria can be separated, or should they be treated as one grand narrative?
[01:09:58.254 --> 01:10:02.817]  Well, first and foremost, I don't believe anything I read in the newspaper, or newspapers, or media.
[01:10:02.877 --> 01:10:05.339]  Listen to me, newspapers, I'm being rather anachronistic here.
[01:10:05.679 --> 01:10:06.820]  I don't believe anything that I hear.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:14.145]  I think that, very frankly, President Trump and T-Rex Tillerson and others are getting a little bit...
[01:10:15.086 --> 01:10:17.427]  Feeling pretty good getting those numbers bumped.
[01:10:17.927 --> 01:10:35.875]  Let's face it, they've been catching grief left and right, and all of a sudden, when you start rattling those sabers and talking about fighting back and dropping MOABs... By the way, this is the mother of all broadcasting right now, but when you talk about that, and you talk about death and destruction and the usual, dare I say this, this phallic referencing...
[01:10:38.476 --> 01:10:48.743]  It has tremendous benefits for poll numbers and the like, and I think, very frankly, the President's human, and his political folks are human, so they're gonna ratchet up this kind of speech.
[01:10:49.323 --> 01:10:53.286]  Unfortunately, as I said, I don't believe anything.
[01:10:53.866 --> 01:10:55.668]  And what I don't also believe is that
[01:10:56.621 --> 01:11:03.510]  This country has never understood, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but nobody ever wants to think about North Korea's perspective.
[01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:12.882]  You know, there's a wonderful scholastic and academic by the name of Bruce Cummings from the University of Chicago to explain this to you.
[01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:17.406]  Cummings to explain the history and the background of North Korea.
[01:11:17.766 --> 01:11:21.228]  And I would venture to say, Paul, that most Americans have no idea.
[01:11:21.248 --> 01:11:23.170]  They're told that Kim Jong Un is an idiot.
[01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:24.130]  He's insane.
[01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:27.392]  He's syphilitic or crazy or whatever he's doing.
[01:11:27.452 --> 01:11:28.533]  He's a man-child.
[01:11:28.953 --> 01:11:29.814]  He's a lunatic.
[01:11:30.374 --> 01:11:31.255]  There's starvation.
[01:11:31.675 --> 01:11:34.176]  And they will believe this.
[01:11:34.617 --> 01:11:37.759]  So what I do hope, and I would be less than
[01:11:38.973 --> 01:12:00.810]  Honest, if I didn't say there isn't a part of me that says, you know, if we could somehow, perhaps by virtue of some kind of cyber shenanigans, disengage or denude someone, disengorge some of their ability to detonate a nuclear bomb, potentially, I'd be less than candid if I didn't say there's a part of me that thought that was a good idea.
[01:12:02.642 --> 01:12:05.104]  We're now doing cyber attacks.
[01:12:05.424 --> 01:12:09.728]  So how are we going to be talking to somebody else who dares to implement the same against us?
[01:12:10.008 --> 01:12:11.910]  Dare I say, dread Russia?
[01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:12.571]  Or whatever.
[01:12:12.611 --> 01:12:14.072]  So it's very, very complicated.
[01:12:14.853 --> 01:12:17.495]  I'm sure that we will work through this.
[01:12:17.955 --> 01:12:20.878]  But Paul, I don't believe anything I hear or read.
[01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:29.212]  No, it's also, you know, something that I've thought about many times is North Koreans, the people themselves, are kind of dehumanized.
[01:12:29.292 --> 01:12:38.316]  People don't realize that, you know, you're not just wiping out a horrible regime, which it is, you're wiping out millions of people who are brainwashed victims.
[01:12:38.736 --> 01:12:43.117]  In their heart of hearts, we know they don't support Dear Leader, we know that they're forced to do so.
[01:12:43.137 --> 01:12:44.898]  You have a network in North Korea
[01:12:45.658 --> 01:12:50.841]  Of 200,000 people in concentration camps, basically thought criminals.
[01:12:50.901 --> 01:12:57.265]  These people have criticised the government or somebody's reported them for not showing enough worship for D'Elida.
[01:12:57.705 --> 01:13:00.727]  You know, you have horrible atrocities being committed in these camps.
[01:13:01.328 --> 01:13:03.389]  You know, these people are victims too.
[01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:06.991]  It's not as if they're right behind D'Elida and that they're falling.
[01:13:07.011 --> 01:13:13.275]  They only support him outwardly because if they didn't, they'd be thrown in a camp with all their entire family.
[01:13:13.715 --> 01:13:22.626]  So when people talk about bombing North Korea, it's very, you know, it's very flagrant and it doesn't account for the fact that these are victims themselves, right?
[01:13:23.087 --> 01:13:29.815]  But also, yes, well again, and I don't want to keep saying this, I believe this to be true.
[01:13:29.835 --> 01:13:32.638]  I mean, I have been so bamboozled
[01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:35.851]  I have been so lied to.
[01:13:36.371 --> 01:13:38.272]  Represent mass destruction, you name it.
[01:13:38.312 --> 01:13:40.592]  So, okay, I'll give you that one.
[01:13:41.053 --> 01:13:42.093]  Let's look a little bit more.
[01:13:42.913 --> 01:13:48.075]  This is a, as others have said, North Korea is a garrisoned country.
[01:13:48.135 --> 01:13:52.897]  This is a country where virtually everybody is or has been in the military.
[01:13:53.777 --> 01:14:09.789]  With an average of 10 years of experience, there is underground, since 1945, they have been building and preparing, they have been at war, or the threat of war, almost their entire existence.
[01:14:10.109 --> 01:14:18.855]  So we're talking caves, we're talking an ability to fight the likes of which we have not seen before.
[01:14:19.095 --> 01:14:20.536]  Understand who this army is.
[01:14:21.434 --> 01:14:28.017]  There's also this idea that South Korea is nirvana, you know, Shangri-La.
[01:14:28.498 --> 01:14:30.018]  Not necessarily so.
[01:14:30.679 --> 01:14:39.203]  So what my concern is, is that when you have, Paul, nothing but
[01:14:41.815 --> 01:14:47.360]  Exercises and war games and saber rattling in South Korea all the time.
[01:14:47.641 --> 01:14:53.126]  Let me ask you something, because you're a bright man despite your jet lag and the fact that you haven't slept in 14 days.
[01:14:54.027 --> 01:15:02.995]  Do you think that maybe, just maybe, we might be precipitating some type of battle by constantly reminding folks we're right here?
[01:15:03.295 --> 01:15:06.759]  And in this era of nuclear bombs, do people think
[01:15:07.379 --> 01:15:13.490]  Like in the era of when you could smoke on an airplane, where people thought that the smoke would go up to aisle 16 and then stop.
[01:15:15.379 --> 01:15:17.360]  Nuclear fallout?
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.862]  Have we lost sight of what we're talking about here?
[01:15:21.782 --> 01:15:39.011]  So while this is terrific, and while everybody universally loathes, hates, derides, abhors this crazed, despotic ruler, the more everybody speaks in unison, I'm sorry if I didn't say this, the more suspect I am of the truth.
[01:15:39.511 --> 01:15:45.695]  Because you understand something, because John Pilgrim should never believe anything unless it's officially denied, and I don't believe anything!
[01:15:46.195 --> 01:15:46.736]  I don't!
[01:15:47.782 --> 01:15:53.004]  Believe, and there's no pro-North Korea contingent, but I don't believe this.
[01:15:53.144 --> 01:15:55.045]  It's as though you want me to believe this.
[01:15:55.085 --> 01:15:58.226]  You want me to sign on to war with North Korea?
[01:15:58.347 --> 01:16:01.528]  And how exactly is that to take place?
[01:16:02.048 --> 01:16:02.748]  Is it limited?
[01:16:02.768 --> 01:16:03.969]  Have we thought about this?
[01:16:04.349 --> 01:16:15.134]  And Paul, when you have somebody by the name of Mad Dog Mathis as the architect of your defense policy, is there not a part of you that's just a tad bit concerned?
[01:16:16.793 --> 01:16:19.395]  I mean, it's incredible how lightly it's treated.
[01:16:19.495 --> 01:16:20.655]  Oh, it's just a nuclear war.
[01:16:20.675 --> 01:16:22.176]  It's just a regional nuclear war.
[01:16:22.677 --> 01:16:24.458]  You know, how are people going to deal with that?
[01:16:24.478 --> 01:16:28.720]  You've got millennials on Twitter who have mental breakdowns if you tag them in a tweet.
[01:16:29.281 --> 01:16:31.622]  How are they going to deal with an actual nuclear war?
[01:16:31.642 --> 01:16:34.344]  Now, of course, you know, it might not conflate with the US.
[01:16:34.384 --> 01:16:38.086]  They might not be under direct assault, under direct threat.
[01:16:38.126 --> 01:16:44.470]  But again, how are people actually going to cope with that, given they can't cope with mean tweets?
[01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:46.151]  May I say something for a minute?
[01:16:46.311 --> 01:16:49.574]  And I know this sounds very gratuitous, but being gratuitous doesn't mean it's not true.
[01:16:50.775 --> 01:17:04.467]  You have been dangerously, diabolically, evilly, if there isn't, brilliant in your YouTube disquisitions on snowflakes,
[01:17:06.309 --> 01:17:22.494]  SJWs, this spineless group of invertebrates, these little powder puffs who show... You know, Paul, in my generation, when I was a kid, I remember kind of like the end of... I mean, I miss the Vietnam War by this much.
[01:17:23.095 --> 01:17:26.896]  The left was anti-war, tough.
[01:17:27.456 --> 01:17:32.278]  The left was dirty jokes, provocative stuff, underground.
[01:17:33.598 --> 01:17:34.518]  Uh, porn.
[01:17:34.638 --> 01:17:35.899]  I mean, blue movie.
[01:17:35.959 --> 01:17:36.499]  Listen to me.
[01:17:36.899 --> 01:17:38.419]  It was cutting edge.
[01:17:38.919 --> 01:17:40.000]  It was the right.
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.860]  It was the adults who said, stop saying that.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:43.781]  Oh, you're dirt.
[01:17:43.921 --> 01:17:44.681]  Oh, you're hateful.
[01:17:44.921 --> 01:17:45.241]  Stop.
[01:17:45.701 --> 01:17:47.562]  The left was cutting edge.
[01:17:47.682 --> 01:17:50.382]  And it was music that talked about war.
[01:17:50.462 --> 01:17:51.383]  And we voted.
[01:17:51.803 --> 01:17:56.584]  And when we or they protested, you didn't scratch your head and said,
[01:17:57.344 --> 01:18:03.028]  This man, this woman, is walking around with foam rubber engorged genitalia and pudenda.
[01:18:03.388 --> 01:18:13.034]  This woman's wearing a knit cap that apparently is some for... I... Wait, wait, wait, you're asking, what the hell are these people even... What are they marching for?
[01:18:13.454 --> 01:18:20.919]  And you have so perfectly targeted these, these imbecilic cretins, these feocians, who...
[01:18:22.401 --> 01:18:24.262]  Do they know anything?
[01:18:24.402 --> 01:18:39.493]  This weekend, in New York, they were protesting, not false flag attacks in Syria, not more war, not Trump going back on his word, as he said, not the MAGA, Make America Great, oh no no no!
[01:18:39.934 --> 01:18:41.255]  They weren't talking about that.
[01:18:41.495 --> 01:18:44.137]  No no, they were protesting Trump's tax returns.
[01:18:45.405 --> 01:18:51.990]  What the hell are they talking about?
[01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:53.551]  They're tax returns?
[01:18:54.332 --> 01:18:55.933]  Do they read anything?
[01:18:56.454 --> 01:19:00.176]  Did they sign up for this like when you rent a hall for a wedding?
[01:19:00.257 --> 01:19:03.079]  I got the deposit down, might as well have the wedding.
[01:19:03.399 --> 01:19:07.262]  Did they arrange that day for protests and they can't go back on their word?
[01:19:10.027 --> 01:19:11.209]  Who are these people?
[01:19:11.269 --> 01:19:12.572]  Do they know what's going on?
[01:19:12.592 --> 01:19:14.755]  And by the way, the staunch...
[01:19:16.044 --> 01:19:24.210]  If you want to call it the right, the mindless Trump acolyte, and there are some of those, have forgotten why they voted for him.
[01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:29.653]  So my dear friend Paul, I think we are in the middle of what appears to be an insane asylum.
[01:19:30.194 --> 01:19:38.099]  From clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here we are stuck in the middle with you, to quote the great Jerry Rafferty.
[01:19:38.359 --> 01:19:39.140]  It's insane!
[01:19:40.007 --> 01:19:41.508]  It is a kind of pincer movement.
[01:19:41.548 --> 01:19:43.630]  We've got insanity on all sides of the equation.
[01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:46.592]  We'll be back to talk about it with Lionel after the break.
[01:19:46.632 --> 01:19:51.856]  Also want to get into the French election, because that is coming up in six days' time with Marine Le Pen.
[01:19:52.257 --> 01:19:53.518]  The polls are all over the place.
[01:19:53.578 --> 01:19:56.440]  We will talk about it in the next segment with Lionel.
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:59.222]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, InfoWars.com.
[01:19:59.262 --> 01:19:59.823]  We'll be back.
[01:20:03.305 --> 01:20:04.807]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[01:20:05.851 --> 01:20:17.863]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[01:20:17.883 --> 01:20:23.048]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies.
[01:20:23.369 --> 01:20:24.189]  You look them up for yourself.
[01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:34.577]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[01:20:34.717 --> 01:20:40.881]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[01:20:41.762 --> 01:20:43.603]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[01:20:44.604 --> 01:20:45.845]  People are falling apart.
[01:20:45.885 --> 01:20:46.866]  They're totally depressed.
[01:20:46.886 --> 01:20:47.426]  They're unhappy.
[01:20:48.026 --> 01:20:48.987]  What is going on?
[01:20:50.248 --> 01:20:54.111]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[01:20:55.339 --> 01:20:57.940]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:00.000]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:07.222]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:21:07.442 --> 01:21:15.764]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWarsLife products.
[01:21:17.176 --> 01:21:23.678]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[01:21:24.058 --> 01:21:27.480]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:30.641]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[01:21:31.241 --> 01:21:36.323]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:21:36.863 --> 01:21:50.733]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[01:21:50.853 --> 01:21:52.294]  The bone is so amazing.
[01:21:52.714 --> 01:21:58.318]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[01:21:59.434 --> 01:22:02.356]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[01:22:02.896 --> 01:22:08.340]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:18.086]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:22.929]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:24.950]  This is a absolute win-win.
[01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:27.770]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[01:22:28.051 --> 01:22:34.192]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.

[01:24:14.742 --> 01:24:17.123]  I wish your butt was still silver.
[01:24:17.804 --> 01:24:18.304]  It was back
[01:24:19.801 --> 01:24:29.345]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show, talking to Lionel.
[01:24:29.365 --> 01:24:31.706]  The website is lionelmedia.com.
[01:24:32.126 --> 01:24:33.947]  Let's stick on geopolitics.
[01:24:34.007 --> 01:24:34.987]  Let's just round up there.
[01:24:35.767 --> 01:24:43.130]  We have the New York Times, and I think you just put out a video, Lionel, called the mainstream media is the enemy of the people on this kind of subject.
[01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:47.272]  The New York Times' Thomas Friedman came out with an article
[01:24:48.072 --> 01:24:50.956]  And this is up on Gateway Pundit, there's a headline.
[01:24:51.096 --> 01:24:55.682]  Media turns liberal mainstream outlets openly siding with ISIS over Trump.
[01:24:56.563 --> 01:24:58.385]  This was Thomas Friedman, New York Times.
[01:24:58.425 --> 01:25:00.708]  He writes that Trump should not fight ISIS.
[01:25:01.926 --> 01:25:08.552]  Quote, the same way we encouraged the Mujahideen fighters to bleed Russia in Afghanistan.
[01:25:08.952 --> 01:25:20.923]  So you have a major New York Times writer openly calling for Trump to leave ISIS alone in the same way that we didn't just leave the Mujahideen alone, of course, in Afghanistan.
[01:25:20.943 --> 01:25:22.084]  We gave them the weapons.
[01:25:22.785 --> 01:25:28.388]  We've seen this from the very beginning when they said openly, let's just back the Al-Qaeda rebels in Syria.
[01:25:28.869 --> 01:25:34.532]  I mean, Lionel, why is the establishment, which after all, you know, embraced this attack on Assad last week.
[01:25:35.032 --> 01:25:35.793]  They loved it.
[01:25:36.173 --> 01:25:42.877]  They immediately forgave Trump for many of his sins in the immediate aftermath of this Tomahawk missile attack.
[01:25:43.397 --> 01:25:50.482]  Why are they now openly encouraging him to allow the spread of a jihadist army that has terrorized an entire continent?
[01:25:51.232 --> 01:25:55.873]  Well, let me see if I can give you an adult and a cogent answer, because they're stupid!
[01:25:56.614 --> 01:25:59.795]  Because Americans are, no, no, stupid!
[01:26:00.475 --> 01:26:14.019]  Don't read, don't care, don't wonder, they're incurious, they know more about sports, they knew more about Tom Brady's under-inflated footballs than they do what's going on.
[01:26:14.379 --> 01:26:16.900]  And what Tom Friedman did, and I am rather
[01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:22.905]  Let's face it, like the great Gore Vidal said, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I'm a conspiracy analyst!
[01:26:23.325 --> 01:26:28.509]  I think somebody went backstage at the New York Times and said, hey Tommy, do me a favor.
[01:26:28.969 --> 01:26:32.572]  I'll bet you, I want you to see how big your CO Jones are.
[01:26:33.012 --> 01:26:40.398]  I want you to write an article basically telling the world that we are using, that the West is using ISIS.
[01:26:41.098 --> 01:26:43.120]  Deliberately, that they are ours.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:50.646]  Put this in an article, and I will bet you that nobody is smart enough to realize what you've just done.
[01:26:51.186 --> 01:27:05.357]  In this article, he basically admits and explains that ISIS is a tool, a tool, ISIS that beheads, kills, slaughters Christians!
[01:27:06.358 --> 01:27:06.858]  ISIS!
[01:27:07.719 --> 01:27:22.398]  The same people that is the embodiment of the boogeyman, he writes in there that basically it's an inside job, it's basically like professional wrestling, and nobody says anything!
[01:27:23.319 --> 01:27:24.421]  This was a test!
[01:27:24.801 --> 01:27:25.462]  This was to say...
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:28.461]  My God, do they read us?
[01:27:28.882 --> 01:27:29.982]  Do they care about us?
[01:27:30.303 --> 01:27:31.763]  Is anybody paying attention to us?
[01:27:31.944 --> 01:27:33.465]  Or do they just not know?
[01:27:33.485 --> 01:27:37.087]  I mean, Paul, I'm still reeling from that.
[01:27:37.607 --> 01:27:44.311]  I can't believe he was allowed to say that, frame that.
[01:27:44.932 --> 01:27:48.554]  That is the blueprint of what's going on.
[01:27:48.814 --> 01:27:50.455]  This is amazing.
[01:27:51.829 --> 01:27:56.395]  I was doing a radio show this morning, to give you an example, and I'm sure you've done this too, because people think I'm nuts!
[01:27:57.096 --> 01:28:04.325]  Could be for different reasons, but, and I said, well, the subject, this is a news radio program, alright.
[01:28:05.206 --> 01:28:09.051]  I said, well, you do realize that there are a lot of people, myself included,
[01:28:10.111 --> 01:28:14.139]  Who believed that the whole gas act was basically a false flag.
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:18.066]  That it was contrived, it was staged, it was orchestrated, as it was in 2013.
[01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:22.454]  Cy Hirsch said this, we have evidence of this, we know it, it's part of their M.O.
[01:28:23.274 --> 01:28:24.395]  And you could hear the crickets!
[01:28:24.455 --> 01:28:26.157]  It was like somebody said, cue the crickets!
[01:28:26.197 --> 01:28:28.019]  And I said, did you hear what I said?
[01:28:28.359 --> 01:28:29.660]  Where the hell have you been?
[01:28:30.161 --> 01:28:31.962]  Paul, am I living in a parallel universe?
[01:28:32.142 --> 01:28:38.829]  Have you and Alex and others deluded me into thinking that somehow everybody knows what we know?
[01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:43.713]  Am I walking around in some kind of a cosmic psychotic fugue where...
[01:28:44.554 --> 01:28:45.616]  Am I the only one?
[01:28:45.636 --> 01:28:47.600]  I'm not talking to a guy in a corner.
[01:28:47.901 --> 01:28:55.354]  I'm talking to a newspaper, a radio host who says, Well, did you see the pictures of the dead babies?
[01:28:55.455 --> 01:28:56.897]  And the guy says, Yes!
[01:28:58.836 --> 01:29:03.660]  That's the thing, Lionel, over and over again, this appeal to sentimentality and emotion.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:10.346]  Yes, it's tragic, but it can still be tragic and be a different narrative from what you're telling us.
[01:29:10.586 --> 01:29:17.412]  The fact that we question the narrative doesn't mean that it's not tragic, doesn't mean that it's not horrific to see children dying.
[01:29:17.472 --> 01:29:20.735]  Yes, people died, but there was no investigation whatsoever
[01:29:21.275 --> 01:29:27.440]  Robert Parry, who is a major journalist, came out and said it looked like an explosion on the ground, not an ordinance dropped from above.
[01:29:27.841 --> 01:29:30.283]  Again, no actual independent investigation.
[01:29:30.603 --> 01:29:33.986]  We're not diminishing the scale of the horror.
[01:29:34.086 --> 01:29:36.228]  They try and pull that card over and over again.
[01:29:36.248 --> 01:29:38.930]  We're going to come back, Lionel, in the next segment and talk about it.
[01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:43.534]  We're going to talk about what happened in Cleveland and the French election coming up in six days' time.
[01:29:44.054 --> 01:29:47.717]  This is the Alex Jones Show live, breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:47.757 --> 01:29:48.258]  We'll be back.
[01:29:52.399 --> 01:29:55.382]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.323 --> 01:29:59.006]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:16.565]  Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network, and of course he's a law enforcement training group and also a well-known respected private detective who becomes highly recommended over the years from our sources.
[01:30:16.985 --> 01:30:23.427]  He has FBI sources also, state police sources, and others in multiple states there on the East Coast.
[01:30:23.587 --> 01:30:24.867]  So Doug Hagman, thank you for joining us.
[01:30:24.967 --> 01:30:28.608]  You look at the battlefront worldwide, the globalist forces, we're in a war right now.
[01:30:29.308 --> 01:30:30.929]  Exactly, and that's part of it.
[01:30:31.269 --> 01:30:57.163]  And when I look at my side of things, on the domestic side, what I'm hearing from my FBI sources, one confirmation I got from both an FBI source as well as an agency source or CIA source, saying watch the role of the National Geospatial Agency, the NGA, as well as the NSA in the upcoming days with respect to the leaks that had come out about the Trump administration, but also
[01:30:57.863 --> 01:30:59.825]  We're about to have nuclear war, folks.
[01:30:59.845 --> 01:31:01.486]  It's time to arrest Hillary Clinton.
[01:31:23.883 --> 01:31:25.064]  We've got to save the country.
[01:31:25.104 --> 01:31:26.826]  The world's never been in more danger.
[01:31:27.446 --> 01:31:28.908]  They're the ones that made everything radical.
[01:31:29.128 --> 01:31:33.351]  Kim Jong-un, Hillary, all these other scumbags, Juncker, all of them need to be arrested.
[01:31:33.612 --> 01:31:34.673]  They're all calling for war.
[01:31:34.873 --> 01:31:36.294]  They're all involved in criminal activity.
[01:31:36.414 --> 01:31:37.135]  Arrest all of them.
[01:31:37.355 --> 01:31:37.855]  I'm serious.
[01:31:38.516 --> 01:31:43.961]  Yeah, 100% behind you because they brought us to this point and they have sold us out.
[01:31:46.342 --> 01:31:56.428]  So we've got this melting pot, or this really sewage pot of strife worldwide.
[01:31:56.488 --> 01:31:59.530]  We got to this point because of Obama, and right now...
[01:32:00.739 --> 01:32:01.840]  And Clinton, especially.
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:15.508]  And by the way, Hillary Clinton played a significant role under Madeleine Albright during the Clinton presidency as the shadow Secretary of State to bring us to this point as well, and then moving on as Secretary of State under Obama.
[01:32:15.528 --> 01:32:21.572]  So this has her fingerprints all over the place, and here we are, you know, at this level.
[01:32:21.612 --> 01:32:28.156]  So there's much more to get into, but watch the next really 72 to 96 hours with respect to the taps.
[01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:32.625]  Why would they want to not have Russia on our side during this China crisis?
[01:32:33.187 --> 01:32:34.790]  Why are they trying to bring Russia down?
[01:32:35.936 --> 01:32:37.117]  Well, chaos.
[01:32:37.217 --> 01:32:38.458]  Operation Chaos, basically.
[01:32:39.038 --> 01:32:46.063]  This is a... Hey, the same playbook that we used, or that the Globals used back in the 60s, is being used today.
[01:32:46.203 --> 01:32:48.225]  And it's everybody against everybody.
[01:32:48.345 --> 01:32:54.730]  Let's destroy, let's burn the whole damn thing down and, you know, start it from scratch.
[01:32:55.590 --> 01:33:01.835]  It's very imprudent to do that, obviously, but these people that we're dealing with, as you pointed out, they're psychos.
[01:33:09.102 --> 01:33:14.068]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:14.408 --> 01:33:16.731]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.876 --> 01:33:33.260]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:40.912]  In the next hour we have Mike Cernovich breaking down that huge revelation that he dropped last night when we went to dinner with him.
[01:33:40.972 --> 01:33:43.255]  Of course Alex talked about it at the top of the show.
[01:33:43.816 --> 01:33:45.759]  Google now deliberately
[01:33:46.460 --> 01:34:03.190]  And it's contractors conspiring to delist Infowars.com articles to relegate them down to a third, fourth tier so they don't appear at the top of Google search results, which is basically the internet at this point, given the monopoly that Google has become.
[01:34:03.730 --> 01:34:06.331]  Absolute flagrant censorship taking place.
[01:34:06.691 --> 01:34:08.391]  We're going to get into that with Mike Cernovich.
[01:34:08.431 --> 01:34:17.274]  Before we go back to Lionel, I just wanted to mention again the X Easter Mega Specials extended for a limited time only at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:17.814 --> 01:34:20.395]  Vital to support us right now.
[01:34:20.695 --> 01:34:25.696]  The attacks have never been this sustained, this intense from across the board.
[01:34:26.036 --> 01:34:28.537]  We don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[01:34:28.837 --> 01:34:31.018]  We don't sell pharmaceutical trash.
[01:34:31.778 --> 01:34:38.203]  To fund our operation, we sell nutritional products that have five-star reviews, independent reviews.
[01:34:38.263 --> 01:34:41.945]  They work for the people who get them, and it supports this network.
[01:34:43.306 --> 01:34:46.588]  30% off Brain Force right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:47.449 --> 01:34:48.350]  This is the supplement.
[01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:50.231]  I popped two right before the show today again.
[01:34:51.052 --> 01:34:51.573]  Jet lag.
[01:34:51.593 --> 01:34:52.413]  Two hours sleep.
[01:34:52.553 --> 01:34:54.755]  This helps immeasurably.
[01:34:55.055 --> 01:34:59.699]  Did the same thing last time I visited and hosted this show with these bright lights.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:00.820]  Two hours sleep.
[01:35:01.201 --> 01:35:02.582]  Popped a couple of Brain Force.
[01:35:03.022 --> 01:35:07.906]  Powerful, nootropic supplement to give you mental clarity.
[01:35:08.487 --> 01:35:08.927]  Energy.
[01:35:09.568 --> 01:35:12.050]  And it's 30% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:13.091]  25% off Supermail Vitality.
[01:35:16.113 --> 01:35:21.657]  As is Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Secret 12, Vitamin B12 and Super Female Vitality.
[01:35:22.218 --> 01:35:24.500]  Again, the ad rolls were taken away from us.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.802]  YouTube demonetization.
[01:35:27.082 --> 01:35:30.184]  Now, Google delisting Infowars.com.
[01:35:30.524 --> 01:35:32.926]  This is all costing us massively.
[01:35:33.267 --> 01:35:36.089]  We're talking about millions of dollars a year.
[01:35:36.529 --> 01:35:38.371]  But you followed through on your support.
[01:35:39.136 --> 01:35:50.381]  Again, immeasurably over the past few weeks, right at the time when we needed it the most, we're being censored across the web, refusing to follow mainstream media propaganda.
[01:35:50.661 --> 01:35:52.061]  We're beholden to you.
[01:35:52.642 --> 01:35:56.823]  We're not beholden to mega donors who tell us what to say.
[01:35:57.244 --> 01:36:02.786]  Nobody comes in here before I go on the air and tells me what stories to cover or what to say about them.
[01:36:03.166 --> 01:36:04.267]  Nobody does it to Alex.
[01:36:04.327 --> 01:36:05.567]  Nobody does it to anyone here.
[01:36:05.948 --> 01:36:07.088]  Complete autonomy.
[01:36:07.368 --> 01:36:09.129]  We're beholden only to you.
[01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:10.070]  Do we make mistakes?
[01:36:10.170 --> 01:36:10.950]  We're not perfect.
[01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:12.131]  Yes, we make mistakes.
[01:36:12.591 --> 01:36:14.972]  But again, we're not being directed.
[01:36:15.453 --> 01:36:19.275]  We're not mouthpieces for people like George Soros.
[01:36:19.655 --> 01:36:23.057]  We rely on you and you only and you have supported us
[01:36:23.928 --> 01:36:31.893]  Greatly in the past few weeks by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com and the Easter Mega Specials are extended for a limited time only.
[01:36:31.993 --> 01:36:36.235]  Take advantage of those today at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:36:37.556 --> 01:36:38.817]  Lionel, we just got cut off there.
[01:36:38.837 --> 01:36:41.778]  You were talking about the chemical weapons attack in Syria.
[01:36:42.339 --> 01:36:45.761]  Questions surrounding its authenticity or at least its origin.
[01:36:46.281 --> 01:36:47.362]  Finish up with your point then.
[01:36:48.142 --> 01:36:51.264]  Well, one of the things which I, look, I don't start off
[01:36:52.392 --> 01:36:57.095]  Questioning the fact that somebody's dead or that people are dying.
[01:36:57.976 --> 01:36:58.537]  I just don't.
[01:36:58.557 --> 01:37:00.238]  I mean, I'm not one of those people.
[01:37:00.618 --> 01:37:01.599]  Well, I should.
[01:37:01.619 --> 01:37:06.022]  Now in 2013, remember a while back, and this is brutal because let's explain something, Paul.
[01:37:06.082 --> 01:37:06.963]  I mean, if you want to get...
[01:37:07.803 --> 01:37:14.967]  If you're going to basically ask that your country engage and prosecute a war, you better know what's going on.
[01:37:15.047 --> 01:37:17.909]  In 2013, remember when they said there was a tragedy in Guta?
[01:37:17.949 --> 01:37:20.910]  I'm not trying to make fun of this, but there was a tragedy in Guta.
[01:37:21.330 --> 01:37:23.651]  And the inspectors came in and said, who, these people?
[01:37:23.692 --> 01:37:23.952]  Yes.
[01:37:24.552 --> 01:37:25.552]  They're decomposing.
[01:37:25.572 --> 01:37:26.733]  Who are they?
[01:37:26.833 --> 01:37:28.334]  No, somebody brought them in.
[01:37:28.714 --> 01:37:28.974]  What?
[01:37:29.535 --> 01:37:33.076]  And because the subject matter was so horrible, people said, oh, I don't want to talk about this.
[01:37:33.477 --> 01:37:34.757]  Then you show the white helmets.
[01:37:35.017 --> 01:37:35.578]  By the way,
[01:37:36.516 --> 01:37:38.677]  George Clooney, what, gave him an Academy Award?
[01:37:38.717 --> 01:37:39.497]  The White Helmets?
[01:37:39.878 --> 01:37:41.418]  Can you believe, seriously?
[01:37:41.778 --> 01:37:44.300]  I mean, does George Clooney, does anybody say George?
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:47.321]  What parallel universe?
[01:37:47.541 --> 01:37:50.562]  The White Helmets, don't let the White, it's an expression.
[01:37:51.003 --> 01:37:59.827]  They're handling dead people, and meanwhile, anybody who is mildly conversant in rudimentary and abecedarian gas,
[01:38:00.507 --> 01:38:01.348]  I don't know.
[01:38:17.583 --> 01:38:18.023]  I don't know.
[01:38:38.698 --> 01:38:56.403]  Somebody says, President decide, you're not going to believe this, T. Rex Tillerson, the President, everybody is saying, hands off Syria, regime change is stupid, there's no reason to even talk about this, let's let Syria decide, get this, this is a genius position, let the Syrians decide what Syria
[01:38:57.577 --> 01:38:58.097]  You should do.
[01:38:58.117 --> 01:38:58.718]  Okay, fine.
[01:38:58.978 --> 01:39:02.081]  Not exactly genius, but in this day and age, it's pretty novel.
[01:39:02.421 --> 01:39:03.842]  So you're Bashar al-Assad.
[01:39:04.062 --> 01:39:07.065]  So what you do is you say, huh, I'm off the hook.
[01:39:07.445 --> 01:39:09.867]  No, hey guys, I got an idea.
[01:39:10.327 --> 01:39:10.908]  Hear me out.
[01:39:11.428 --> 01:39:14.190]  I'm gonna gas my people now.
[01:39:14.711 --> 01:39:14.931]  What?
[01:39:15.411 --> 01:39:17.053]  Yeah, now.
[01:39:17.493 --> 01:39:25.820]  Now that basically I've averted war, I, because I'm insane, I'm wacky, I'm a lunatic,
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:30.422]  It doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
[01:39:30.682 --> 01:39:45.968]  And then, and kudos to you again, my friend, what we do is, we attack an airbase, now work with me on this one, an airbase, and I would think, Paul, I mean, I'm not a military genius here, but I think the runway's pretty important in an airbase.
[01:39:46.428 --> 01:39:47.908]  We leave the runways alone.
[01:39:48.208 --> 01:39:49.409]  Okay, fine.
[01:39:49.989 --> 01:40:08.536]  But we hit kind of underneath, and we hit these planes, and it turns out that that base in Shariat, or whatever the pronunciation is, actually protected Christian cities from fending off ISIS, who, according to Tom Friedman, is really our friend, because it will help bleed Russia, Hezbollah, and Iran.
[01:40:08.756 --> 01:40:11.357]  Now, I'm crazy?
[01:40:12.037 --> 01:40:12.797]  You're crazy?
[01:40:12.917 --> 01:40:14.017]  Alex is crazy?
[01:40:14.678 --> 01:40:14.938]  We're...
[01:40:16.367 --> 01:40:23.053]  I'm looking at this insanity merely asking questions and my perspective is being questioned.
[01:40:23.573 --> 01:40:26.415]  None of this makes any sense.
[01:40:26.595 --> 01:40:40.206]  And when you put your videos on and you explain this, as long as you're able to do that, as long as you're not, you know, arrested for speaking the truth, it makes just so much sense.
[01:40:40.747 --> 01:40:42.308]  None of this makes any sense.
[01:40:42.328 --> 01:40:44.290]  And by the way, Paul, I got to say this.
[01:40:45.214 --> 01:40:46.635]  I am not a religious person.
[01:40:46.695 --> 01:40:53.017]  I'm a retired Catholic, and I wish nothing but people of faith all over the world peace, happiness, and whatever.
[01:40:53.798 --> 01:40:57.780]  But yesterday, especially if you follow Facebook, it was, he is risen.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:59.520]  He is risen!
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:01.841]  Jesus Christ is my savior!
[01:41:02.181 --> 01:41:03.982]  Quoting everything you can imagine.
[01:41:04.462 --> 01:41:05.043]  Great!
[01:41:05.683 --> 01:41:06.284]  Good for you.
[01:41:06.584 --> 01:41:07.545]  I like his word.
[01:41:07.685 --> 01:41:08.465]  Do unto others.
[01:41:08.706 --> 01:41:09.086]  Peace.
[01:41:09.526 --> 01:41:10.287]  Feed the poor.
[01:41:10.747 --> 01:41:11.368]  Wonderful.
[01:41:11.628 --> 01:41:12.108]  Wonderful.
[01:41:12.509 --> 01:41:29.023]  These same people, these cafeteria Christians and cafeteria Catholics, all of a sudden will go from basically espousing and promulgating the word of Christ, which is peace, love, helping the poor, and will pivot into let's bomb and drop the mother of all bombs.
[01:41:29.443 --> 01:41:32.506]  And watch as they speak almost orgasmic about it.
[01:41:33.146 --> 01:41:41.473]  The explosive power, look at this thing, look how big it is, and look how we targeted, and we showed them, and we got them.
[01:41:41.493 --> 01:41:45.897]  And I'm thinking, wait a minute, you just told me five minutes ago about God, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:41:46.157 --> 01:41:57.447]  But Jesus is on our side, and so it is schizophrenic, disjointed, none of this makes any sense, and my beloved country, my fellow Americans, know nothing about history.
[01:41:57.467 --> 01:42:00.909]  You know, Tolstoy said history would be a wonderful thing, if only it were true!
[01:42:01.630 --> 01:42:10.893]  And so we're just told and given this manichaean idea, Bashar al-Assad's a bad guy, this is a good guy, and, and, Paul, maybe you can help me out with this one.
[01:42:11.373 --> 01:42:18.355]  I'm still trying to figure out, if somebody could tell me, how exactly did the Russians tap into and hand the election to Trump?
[01:42:18.675 --> 01:42:20.036]  I'm still waiting for this one!
[01:42:21.744 --> 01:42:27.547]  You and I are living in an asylum, with all due respect to asylum.
[01:42:28.608 --> 01:42:33.210]  We are in a parallel universe where people know nothing.
[01:42:33.810 --> 01:42:40.574]  They just read this playbook, bumper sticker, cookie cutter, echo chamber, basically front page.
[01:42:40.614 --> 01:42:44.536]  They turn to CNN and MSDNC and others.
[01:42:45.546 --> 01:42:51.271]  They'll devote five minutes, whenever there's bombing, people clap, and they know absolutely nothing.
[01:42:51.691 --> 01:42:52.952]  And yet, you're the nut.
[01:42:53.593 --> 01:42:54.834]  You're the dangerous person.
[01:42:55.174 --> 01:42:56.575]  You're the conspiracy theorist.
[01:42:57.016 --> 01:42:57.456]  You are.
[01:42:57.736 --> 01:42:58.177]  Not them.
[01:42:59.038 --> 01:43:02.180]  I mean, I feel overwhelmed just reading the news every day.
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:08.666]  You can understand why they just take it from the top, from the few headlines, and don't dig in any further.
[01:43:08.706 --> 01:43:10.007]  You can see the process.
[01:43:10.047 --> 01:43:11.768]  I mean, it is genuinely overwhelming.
[01:43:13.029 --> 01:43:16.732]  Brian Williams, by the way, the only guy to get in trouble for lying about the Iraq War.
[01:43:16.912 --> 01:43:17.593]  Think about that one.
[01:43:17.673 --> 01:43:18.633]  The only person!
[01:43:19.194 --> 01:43:26.999]  And he goes on, and Rachel Maddow apparently was dissed by him, and again, he waxes orgasmic over this.
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:31.182]  Does this man have any idea of what he's talking about?
[01:43:31.522 --> 01:43:34.765]  And then what happens is, you have this unique
[01:43:35.848 --> 01:43:37.169]  And this is what people should realize.
[01:43:37.930 --> 01:43:47.280]  For the first time, there is an absolute existential threat to the mainstream, alt-left, anti-Trump, puppet, sock-puppet media.
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:49.342]  There's a real existential threat.
[01:43:50.083 --> 01:43:50.483]  You.
[01:43:51.424 --> 01:43:54.828]  You, Alex, Cernovich, all these folks.
[01:43:55.348 --> 01:43:55.669]  Name it.
[01:43:56.713 --> 01:43:57.153]  You are.
[01:43:57.894 --> 01:44:01.317]  And what happens is they're saying, oh my God, what do we do?
[01:44:01.377 --> 01:44:18.110]  Do you know that on your worst day, on your worst day, your worst video, your worst, I mean, you outdo, I don't know how many conventional brick and mortar, hardcore conventional media.
[01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:19.751]  Do you know what that does to them?
[01:44:20.211 --> 01:44:21.553]  And now they're turning to their friends.
[01:44:21.693 --> 01:44:24.535]  And by the way, I got to say something right now, because you mentioned this Facebook.
[01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:37.809]  Can you please explain to me, and I'm a lawyer by profession, and I don't want people to be in any way linked criminally to somebody who is inspired by some insanity.
[01:44:38.009 --> 01:44:43.353]  Somebody could read your poetry, listen to your song, and go out and kill 12, and I don't think you should be held responsible.
[01:44:43.633 --> 01:44:47.476]  But Facebook knows everything, Paul, about you.
[01:44:47.816 --> 01:44:48.597]  Good morning, Paul.
[01:44:50.418 --> 01:44:51.319]  35 degrees in your town.
[01:44:51.659 --> 01:44:52.340]  Good morning, Paul.
[01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:53.941]  Paul, can we have your phone number?
[01:44:54.121 --> 01:44:55.202]  Paul, can we have your email?
[01:44:55.422 --> 01:44:57.703]  Paul, would you... Hey, this is in your neighborhood.
[01:44:57.743 --> 01:44:59.244]  Paul, we know where you are.
[01:44:59.564 --> 01:45:00.385]  We know you're friends.
[01:45:00.525 --> 01:45:02.146]  Hey, Paul, remember saying this a year ago?
[01:45:02.326 --> 01:45:03.127]  Hey, Paul, remember this?
[01:45:03.407 --> 01:45:06.669]  We know where you are.
[01:45:07.069 --> 01:45:15.115]  But if Paul Joseph Watson decides to get a gun, hold somebody hostage, or rape somebody for five days, or beat somebody, they don't know where you are!
[01:45:16.218 --> 01:45:19.040]  I don't know what you're talking about!
[01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:30.527]  You think maybe, maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm Mr. Conspiracy Theory, that they don't want to tell the cops where these people are because then they're going to realize that they're basically admitting that they know where we are?
[01:45:30.547 --> 01:45:34.210]  Do you not find it funny that if I post something that doesn't...
[01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:48.244]  That calls into question Obama's birth or whatever, something that does not meet the arduous, you know, fact filters of PolitiFact and Snopes, by the way, the biggest con since the neck tattoo.
[01:45:48.685 --> 01:45:54.211]  But do you think that maybe, I mean, those are people who say, take that down, who know everything about me.
[01:45:54.551 --> 01:45:55.872]  I'm doing Facebook Live.
[01:45:56.817 --> 01:45:59.681]  They can't find somebody on the run?
[01:45:59.701 --> 01:46:03.707]  I mean, are you kidding me?
[01:46:04.028 --> 01:46:06.011]  Do they expect me to believe that?
[01:46:07.276 --> 01:46:08.817]  I mean, it is interesting, isn't it?
[01:46:09.077 --> 01:46:11.899]  The photos we know are geotagged where they can locate them.
[01:46:11.919 --> 01:46:12.980]  But I mean, let's get on to that.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:13.840]  I wanted to cover it.
[01:46:14.281 --> 01:46:17.523]  Of course, we had this horrific video which was uploaded.
[01:46:17.903 --> 01:46:21.906]  He goes up to this guy, this frail old man, shoots him.
[01:46:22.186 --> 01:46:24.868]  Absolutely senseless, horrific murder.
[01:46:25.088 --> 01:46:27.710]  You can't even pin any kind of narrative to this.
[01:46:27.790 --> 01:46:33.814]  At least with ISIS beheading, you can pin a narrative from where it came from, even though it's completely horrific in and of itself.
[01:46:34.254 --> 01:46:34.915]  But with this,
[01:46:35.635 --> 01:46:39.638]  I mean, do you think that, you know, social media has encouraged this kind of insanity?
[01:46:40.159 --> 01:46:41.620]  Or is it pre-existing?
[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:43.982]  Is it going to happen with or without Facebook?
[01:46:44.523 --> 01:46:53.050]  Or do you think that this kind of instant celebrity, as dark as it is, is encouraging to do this, people, through social media?
[01:46:53.666 --> 01:46:53.906]  Yes.
[01:46:54.246 --> 01:46:56.287]  The answer is, of course, yes, whenever you do that.
[01:46:56.608 --> 01:47:04.072]  Look, there was a time years ago when, you know, I'm sure when the Gutenberg Press came along and said, hey, this is great, we can print the Bible.
[01:47:04.712 --> 01:47:08.854]  Well, as soon as pornographers came along, they said, no, no, we got something else in mind.
[01:47:09.215 --> 01:47:13.197]  Well, nobody's going to, you know, blast or blast the printing press.
[01:47:13.857 --> 01:47:18.179]  We had the anarchist cookbook in 1970 where people would say, you can't print that!
[01:47:18.619 --> 01:47:21.340]  You're going to encourage people to make bombs!
[01:47:22.221 --> 01:47:23.501]  This has been going on forever.
[01:47:24.102 --> 01:47:27.483]  What it does is social media potentiates insanity.
[01:47:27.503 --> 01:47:28.444]  It doesn't cause it.
[01:47:28.884 --> 01:47:30.265]  It inspires some.
[01:47:30.685 --> 01:47:31.885]  But here's the best part.
[01:47:32.466 --> 01:47:34.827]  If you provide a platform,
[01:47:35.527 --> 01:47:49.475]  If you, you know in the world of libel, if you republish something over and over and over and you're basically responsible for repeating something that people have considered to be libelous or detrimental or whatever it is, you hold a certain degree of responsibility.
[01:47:49.775 --> 01:47:52.117]  But what I don't understand is, how is it?
[01:47:52.757 --> 01:47:58.583]  That a group of people, Facebook in particular, that is so persnickety.
[01:47:58.924 --> 01:48:03.268]  Have you ever had posts that you've wanted to post denied?
[01:48:04.009 --> 01:48:04.850]  Denied?
[01:48:04.930 --> 01:48:05.871]  Or they say no?
[01:48:06.311 --> 01:48:07.052]  Yeah, all the time.
[01:48:07.072 --> 01:48:10.375]  I mean, at one stage they were blocking every post as spam.
[01:48:10.415 --> 01:48:12.538]  If it was an InfoWars link, it was incredible.
[01:48:13.052 --> 01:48:21.257]  So that means that somewhere, somebody said, we're gonna put into an encryption algorithm your name.
[01:48:21.638 --> 01:48:24.880]  Now, do you think somebody would say, hey, Zuckerberg, I got an idea.
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:33.085]  Can you maybe put in something that looks for the word kill, or listens for gunshots?
[01:48:33.706 --> 01:48:39.310]  Or maybe, just maybe, is there a main office at Facebook?
[01:48:39.570 --> 01:48:42.732]  Does somebody say, hello, thank you for calling Facebook.
[01:48:43.192 --> 01:48:46.073]  Did you know somebody's killing people on Facebook?
[01:48:46.453 --> 01:48:48.654]  I'm sorry, stand by, we'll put you online too.
[01:48:49.195 --> 01:48:52.436]  Yeah, hey boss, you know somebody is killing somebody?
[01:48:52.816 --> 01:48:55.017]  Can we track these people down?
[01:48:55.037 --> 01:49:06.362]  I know that we basically have every aspect of their life that has been recorded and through cross-referencing.
[01:49:07.403 --> 01:49:22.783]  I want, I cannot believe how in this world of hyper-militarization and MOABs and, you know, predictive software, minority report stuff, we have Paul.
[01:49:23.803 --> 01:49:26.006]  TV's that can listen to you.
[01:49:26.026 --> 01:49:34.116]  But we can't find a person on the run who basically uses Facebook?
[01:49:34.877 --> 01:49:37.740]  Nobody can... You think somebody would say, I know exactly where he is.
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:38.301]  He's right here.
[01:49:38.521 --> 01:49:38.761]  Boom.
[01:49:38.821 --> 01:49:39.242]  Thank you.
[01:49:39.262 --> 01:49:40.403]  How does this happen?
[01:49:41.104 --> 01:49:42.787]  Now, does anybody question that?
[01:49:42.887 --> 01:49:46.392]  And I'm not necessarily saying that it's their responsibility.
[01:49:46.732 --> 01:49:48.295]  I'm not saying it's their fault.
[01:49:48.535 --> 01:49:49.416]  I'm not doing that.
[01:49:49.897 --> 01:49:53.542]  But what I love is the selectivity of Big Brother.
[01:49:53.943 --> 01:49:56.266]  Sometimes he helps, sometimes he doesn't.
[01:49:56.326 --> 01:49:57.067]  And by the way,
[01:49:57.888 --> 01:50:04.116]  This, this great equalizer, let's look at that fellow Mr. Dow the other day on United Airlines.
[01:50:04.176 --> 01:50:14.448]  Were it not for citizen journalists who became the eyes and ears of the collective conscience of the country, all of this would have been just swept under the rug.
[01:50:14.748 --> 01:50:16.069]  So what I'm saying is, is that
[01:50:17.188 --> 01:50:18.449]  None of this makes any sense.
[01:50:19.129 --> 01:50:21.871]  They know exactly where I am.
[01:50:22.311 --> 01:50:24.332]  They know exactly where you are.
[01:50:24.812 --> 01:50:36.859]  And I, maybe I'm the conspiracy nut here, but do you mean to tell me that there isn't the remotest of possibilities where somebody is saying, you know, if we all of a sudden break the door down, maybe that kind of sends the wrong message?
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:37.680]  I don't know.
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:44.324]  I've never been surprised when it comes to corporate and government merging and the insanity that results therefrom.
[01:50:46.243 --> 01:50:48.124]  We will be back with Lionel.
[01:50:48.184 --> 01:50:50.946]  Final segment we're going to talk about the French election coming up.
[01:50:51.546 --> 01:50:57.309]  InfoWars.com, Breaking News, also Cernovich live in studio next hour.
[01:50:57.590 --> 01:50:58.810]  Be sure to stay tuned for that.
[01:50:58.950 --> 01:51:00.791]  Again, Breaking News, InfoWars.com.
[01:51:00.811 --> 01:51:01.312]  Don't go away.
[01:51:03.092 --> 01:51:04.172]  Want to stop progress?
[01:51:04.433 --> 01:51:06.233]  Contact your local Progressive Democrat.
[01:51:06.413 --> 01:51:11.974]  With Airbnb rising in popularity, the hotel industry is freaking out and Progressive Democrats are responding.
[01:51:12.234 --> 01:51:17.815]  First, the Federal Trade Commission requested an investigation be done into how Airbnb was affecting the housing market.
[01:51:17.975 --> 01:51:25.517]  Why waste our money on that, I'm not sure, but Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo signed a bill making it a finable offense to post on Airbnb.
[01:51:25.757 --> 01:51:29.558]  Another example of the government getting involved in private business where it doesn't belong.
[01:51:29.818 --> 01:51:36.220]  If you violate a lease, that is between you and your leaseholder, but now the government has a preemptive strike against the Airbnb host.
[01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:40.841]  You can be sure this is a result of the hotel industry lobbying our fine politicians.
[01:51:41.221 --> 01:51:53.604]  Linda Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the bill, said, This sets a standard for those struggling with the impact of Airbnb on affordable housing, which doesn't even make sense because innovation and competition always lowers costs.
[01:51:53.784 --> 01:51:55.725]  But these are Democrats we're talking about here.
[01:51:55.925 --> 01:51:57.947]  So don't bother trying to progress an industry.
[01:51:58.147 --> 01:52:00.268]  Progressive Democrats are waiting to stop you.
[01:52:00.428 --> 01:52:02.550]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:52:12.717 --> 01:52:20.663]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about BioPCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:52:20.683 --> 01:52:23.786]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[01:52:24.588 --> 01:52:26.408]  And they're also very affordable.
[01:52:26.428 --> 01:52:26.748]  Exactly.
[01:52:26.768 --> 01:52:28.569]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[01:52:28.589 --> 01:52:31.910]  You talk about... We're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[01:52:31.970 --> 01:52:33.250]  We've both talked to them.
[01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:42.392]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[01:52:42.772 --> 01:52:42.932]  Okay?
[01:52:43.272 --> 01:52:44.352]  We refuse to screw people.
[01:52:44.712 --> 01:52:45.672]  We refuse to do that.
[01:52:46.052 --> 01:52:48.013]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[01:52:48.573 --> 01:52:55.326]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[01:52:55.727 --> 01:52:56.488]  It's a win-win.
[01:52:56.969 --> 01:52:57.931]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:53:03.306 --> 01:53:05.008]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.

[01:54:26.434 --> 01:54:28.214]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show live.
[01:54:28.234 --> 01:54:34.995]  Before we go back to Lionel, I just want to tell you about another great special we have at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:54:35.035 --> 01:54:38.356]  This is Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[01:54:38.796 --> 01:54:43.857]  It's selling out fast, but we have it 25% off while supplies last.
[01:54:43.897 --> 01:54:51.158]  Again, we're quickly selling out of this deep earth iodine supply at InfoWarsLife.com as we face the biggest threat.
[01:54:51.618 --> 01:54:59.989]  To our supply in more than four years now is your chance to stock up on this essential supplement at a drastically reduced price of 25% off.
[01:55:00.009 --> 01:55:00.930]  That is a great deal.
[01:55:01.331 --> 01:55:06.858]  Help us get enough funding to try and place a new order with our supplier.
[01:55:06.959 --> 01:55:08.981]  So this is not going to stick around for long.
[01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:19.672]  It is nascent iodine, and again, it supports this network in the face of continued sustained attacks from the establishment, from the mainstream media.
[01:55:20.092 --> 01:55:20.392]  25% off.
[01:55:20.813 --> 01:55:23.896]  We've still got the Easter mega specials extended for a limited time.
[01:55:23.916 --> 01:55:30.482]  30% off brain force, 25% off super male vitality, 25% off vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:55:31.463 --> 01:55:38.725]  Same discount on the Vitamin B12, the Super Female Vitality and Survival Shield X2 and many others at infowarsstore.com.
[01:55:39.065 --> 01:55:48.427]  Five-star independent reviews support the growth, the survival of this network by getting the products at infowarslife.com.
[01:55:48.927 --> 01:55:50.948]  Lionel, we've got a couple of minutes left.
[01:55:51.268 --> 01:55:52.288]  We're probably not going to get time.
[01:55:52.328 --> 01:55:53.668]  Just touch on the French election.
[01:55:53.688 --> 01:55:57.089]  I just want to get your quick take on the French election in the final couple of minutes here.
[01:55:58.012 --> 01:56:16.398]  You know, one of the things that, of course, our mainstream media portray Marine Le Pen to be some kind of nut, she's a Nazi, and, you know, of course, well, of course, whenever I heard that initially, I said, oh, I want to hear what she has to say, because remember, whatever the media say, mainstream media, it's the opposite.
[01:56:16.478 --> 01:56:20.160]  They are the reverse or inverse search dog.
[01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:21.340]  You know, the bloodhound.
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:23.481]  When the dog goes this way, go this way.
[01:56:24.241 --> 01:56:28.745]  Like they said, never believe anything until it's officially denied.
[01:56:29.526 --> 01:56:38.115]  Did you hear what she said when they asked her questions about what do you have against people wearing burkas or women wearing burkinis?
[01:56:38.175 --> 01:56:40.076]  And what's your beef?
[01:56:40.557 --> 01:56:42.158]  And she would say things like,
[01:56:42.819 --> 01:56:43.819]  That's not French.
[01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:45.980]  That's not the way we are.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.582]  And when I listened to that, I said, wait a minute.
[01:56:49.602 --> 01:56:51.703]  Now, I may be extrapolating a tad too much here.
[01:56:51.783 --> 01:56:52.083]  Maybe.
[01:56:52.523 --> 01:56:53.323]  Won't be the first time.
[01:56:53.544 --> 01:56:54.364]  Won't be the last time.
[01:56:55.117 --> 01:56:57.138]  But this is what Trump's message was.
[01:56:57.398 --> 01:57:13.308]  And by the way, before he went into this neocon frenzy, before I guess they got to him, when he was going to make America great, and believed in infrastructure, and jobs, and what really mattered, what got him elected, but that's another issue.
[01:57:13.928 --> 01:57:19.732]  But what she was saying was that there is this core value principle of what we are.
[01:57:19.752 --> 01:57:21.514]  This is who we are.
[01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:22.194]  The French.
[01:57:22.454 --> 01:57:24.016]  Whether you agree or not, it doesn't matter.
[01:57:24.396 --> 01:57:25.957]  Now, do you know what they call that?
[01:57:26.477 --> 01:57:27.458]  Nationalism.
[01:57:27.698 --> 01:57:29.500]  Or my favorite, populism.
[01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:32.222]  Or, if you really want to be crazy, nativism.
[01:57:32.822 --> 01:57:36.428]  I want people to watch this because that's not about France.
[01:57:36.468 --> 01:57:39.774]  It's not about their particular idiosyncratic geography.
[01:57:40.094 --> 01:57:47.186]  This is about world themes, world memes, and world tropes that you will see here now and in the immediate future.
[01:57:48.308 --> 01:57:49.428]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:57:49.468 --> 01:57:52.649]  We have an article which we posted.
[01:57:53.150 --> 01:57:58.871]  500,000 ballots have been sent out to people who live outside of France with two votes!
[01:57:58.951 --> 01:58:00.872]  They've got two polling cards!
[01:58:01.392 --> 01:58:06.514]  That obviously means that people who are naturally going to be against Le Pen are going to have the opportunity to vote twice.
[01:58:06.894 --> 01:58:09.495]  The police are saying they're not even going to investigate it.
[01:58:09.575 --> 01:58:09.995]  Incredible.
[01:58:10.375 --> 01:58:13.836]  Lionel, quickly, 20 seconds, tell people where they can find you on YouTube and Twitter.
[01:58:14.784 --> 01:58:16.845]  At YouTube, at LionelNation.
[01:58:16.865 --> 01:58:22.146]  Our YouTube channel is LionelNation and Twitter is at LionelMedia.
[01:58:22.686 --> 01:58:23.927]  And Paul, thank you.
[01:58:24.167 --> 01:58:29.048]  I am your biggest fan, your most diehard acolyte and apostle.
[01:58:29.329 --> 01:58:30.869]  Keep up your great work, my friend.
[01:58:30.969 --> 01:58:32.710]  Okay, you keep it up too, Lionel.
[01:58:32.770 --> 01:58:34.570]  We'll be sure to get you back on the air.
[01:58:34.630 --> 01:58:36.991]  LionelMedia.com, at LionelMedia.
[01:58:37.051 --> 01:58:39.772]  We will be back with the third hour of the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:58:39.792 --> 01:58:40.292]  Don't go away.
[01:58:44.464 --> 01:58:46.348]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:50.094]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:54.033 --> 01:58:55.114]  You have no money?
[01:58:55.374 --> 01:58:57.335]  This is okay, we will take your blood.
[01:58:57.615 --> 01:59:02.958]  If you want access to the Vatican Museums, cash, visa, MasterCard or needle is accepted.
[01:59:03.278 --> 01:59:06.620]  That's right, you can give blood to access the Vatican Museum.
[01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:11.382]  The blood payment plan has a slogan, give blood and follow your artistic inclination.
[01:59:11.642 --> 01:59:14.924]  Blood donors then receive a voucher which gives them access to the museums.
[01:59:15.284 --> 01:59:18.886]  The director of the Vatican Museum said, without blood there is no life.
[01:59:19.366 --> 01:59:21.828]  Without art, life would be empty and sad.
[01:59:22.548 --> 01:59:24.230]  Okay, I love Jesus too.
[01:59:24.330 --> 01:59:25.010]  Happy Easter!
[01:59:25.711 --> 01:59:26.931]  I guess this is a good idea.
[01:59:27.352 --> 01:59:30.014]  Get some blood donations and allow people access to history.
[01:59:30.294 --> 01:59:30.974]  Sounds harmless.
[01:59:31.194 --> 01:59:31.615]  But wait!
[01:59:32.055 --> 01:59:34.597]  Each blood donation is good for a 4 euro voucher.
[01:59:34.997 --> 01:59:37.379]  It costs 16 euros to access the museums.
[01:59:38.099 --> 01:59:41.241]  So you have to donate blood four times before you can even get in.
[01:59:41.822 --> 01:59:44.404]  By the time you've given enough blood, you'd have fainted.
[01:59:45.204 --> 01:59:49.288]  Enjoy Michelangelo's Last Judgment as you recover from hypovolemia.
[01:59:49.768 --> 01:59:52.010]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[01:59:54.932 --> 02:00:00.837]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.321 --> 02:00:16.483]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:16.983 --> 02:00:21.847]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:21.867 --> 02:00:26.852]  Yeah, there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head.
[02:00:27.752 --> 02:00:31.876]  Wrapped up in silence, our circuits are dead.
[02:00:31.896 --> 02:00:32.737]  Can I decode?
[02:00:33.577 --> 02:00:34.017]  We're live!
[02:00:34.097 --> 02:00:37.998]  It's the third and final hour of my spot on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:38.018 --> 02:00:40.258]  Today we have David Knight coming up with the fourth hour.
[02:00:40.838 --> 02:00:50.480]  Next segment, Mike Cernovich to break down that massive bombshell story about Google delisting, relegating InfoWars.com articles.
[02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:53.141]  He's going to break that down here in the next segment.
[02:00:53.221 --> 02:00:57.642]  First, I want to cover this, which is what we briefly touched on in the last segment.
[02:00:57.682 --> 02:00:58.802]  This is out of the Express.
[02:00:59.522 --> 02:01:04.765]  How Marine Le Pen is facing wipeout in French election after computer blunder.
[02:01:05.225 --> 02:01:07.186]  Just a blunder, nothing to worry about.
[02:01:07.226 --> 02:01:09.908]  They're not even going to investigate it until after the election.
[02:01:10.328 --> 02:01:14.731]  A monumental computer blunder could cost Marine Le Pen the French election.
[02:01:15.171 --> 02:01:20.094]  As 500,000 citizens living outside of France have the chance to vote twice.
[02:01:20.914 --> 02:01:21.855]  Nobody cares.
[02:01:21.895 --> 02:01:23.315]  They're not even going to investigate.
[02:01:23.716 --> 02:01:27.318]  Half a million people received duplicate polling cards in the post.
[02:01:27.898 --> 02:01:32.981]  Which would allow them to cast two votes at the first round of the French election held on April 23rd.
[02:01:33.381 --> 02:01:36.722]  French authorities confirmed they would not be investigating.
[02:01:36.763 --> 02:01:38.403]  They're not going to investigate it.
[02:01:39.364 --> 02:01:50.870]  Even though it's potential electoral fraud, until after the election, when retrospective prosecution may take place, this could crush Marine Le Pen's dreams of surging to power.
[02:01:51.630 --> 02:02:01.661]  Now bear in mind the polls currently show Marine Le Pen 20%, Emmanuel Macron the fake populist who was hatched out of the establishment literally in a political lab.
[02:02:01.881 --> 02:02:04.584]  They tried to sell him as a fake populist.
[02:02:04.664 --> 02:02:05.205]  It failed.
[02:02:05.505 --> 02:02:06.326]  He's plummeting.
[02:02:06.667 --> 02:02:10.230]  You have this far-left communist candidate Melun Sean.
[02:02:10.751 --> 02:02:14.692]  Who they're calling the French Hugo Chavez because Venezuela is such a great example.
[02:02:14.772 --> 02:02:16.413]  Everything's going hunky-dory there, isn't it?
[02:02:16.833 --> 02:02:18.194]  But he's shot up to 20%.
[02:02:18.974 --> 02:02:20.735]  It's all over the place.
[02:02:21.155 --> 02:02:32.719]  Of course, the only person who's actually put forward any policies that will address the dire situation in France when it comes to Islamism, terror attacks and the march of Sharia law
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:38.146]  That's Marine Le Pen, but now she's being sabotaged.
[02:02:38.747 --> 02:02:40.769]  500,000 citizens living outside of France.
[02:02:40.829 --> 02:02:48.059]  Again, more likely to vote for an establishment pro-EU candidate, not likely to vote for Marine Le Pen.
[02:02:49.226 --> 02:02:52.009]  They're going to get two votes and nobody cares.
[02:02:52.709 --> 02:02:55.372]  Not even going to investigate it until after the election.
[02:02:55.832 --> 02:02:59.075]  These people, some of them, will use both votes.
[02:02:59.156 --> 02:03:00.377]  Don't deny it.
[02:03:00.937 --> 02:03:04.040]  I mean, don't hide behind their supposed moral high ground.
[02:03:04.321 --> 02:03:05.261]  Some of them will do that.
[02:03:06.027 --> 02:03:09.030]  And that's electoral fraud and it should be investigated.
[02:03:09.710 --> 02:03:11.452]  Absolutely insane story.
[02:03:11.492 --> 02:03:12.893]  We have Sky News reporting.
[02:03:13.714 --> 02:03:17.397]  Unprecedented migrant situation in the Mediterranean.
[02:03:17.437 --> 02:03:25.965]  A charity that rescues migrants has described the situation this weekend as unprecedented after going to the aid of people aboard nine boats in the Mediterranean Sea.
[02:03:27.026 --> 02:03:30.233]  They rescued 1,500 to 1,800 men, women and children.
[02:03:30.253 --> 02:03:36.105]  Of course, not normally very many women and children as you can see in that photo right there.
[02:03:37.267 --> 02:03:39.028]  And this is what's going on with the migrant crisis.
[02:03:39.489 --> 02:03:42.431]  It's not even a refugee crisis, okay?
[02:03:42.751 --> 02:03:46.774]  The vast majority of citizens are not Syrian.
[02:03:46.874 --> 02:03:48.495]  They're not even Syrian refugees.
[02:03:48.515 --> 02:03:49.696]  That's a small percentage.
[02:03:49.996 --> 02:03:53.458]  What's happening out of Libya, they send out boats.
[02:03:53.679 --> 02:03:57.581]  It's not as if these people are struggling to get all the way from Libya into Europe.
[02:03:57.942 --> 02:04:03.646]  If they can get on a boat, if they can get 11 miles away from Libyan shores, the EU
[02:04:04.426 --> 02:04:13.771]  And these NGO groups literally send out boats as a taxi service to pick up these migrants 11 miles offshore from Libya.
[02:04:14.491 --> 02:04:16.832]  And most of them don't even come from Libya.
[02:04:17.132 --> 02:04:19.573]  They're coming from other West African countries.
[02:04:20.114 --> 02:04:25.156]  The NGOs, the EU, is conspiring with people smugglers.
[02:04:25.797 --> 02:04:30.379]  They literally call them up and say, we've got a boatload of people, come and pick them up.
[02:04:30.959 --> 02:04:32.740]  That's not a migrant crisis!
[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:38.981]  That's using migrants as a weapon to destabilize the West, and nobody knows about it.
[02:04:39.021 --> 02:04:40.802]  They're not being told that story.
[02:04:41.422 --> 02:04:43.223]  At this point, it's a taxi service.
[02:04:43.543 --> 02:04:51.805]  We've seen the massive social problems that it's causing in Europe, and that's being exacerbated by the EU, by these NGOs.
[02:04:51.845 --> 02:04:57.306]  We'll be back with Mike Cernovich, breaking huge news about Google censorship, right after this.
[02:04:57.467 --> 02:04:58.147]  Infowars.com.
[02:05:03.513 --> 02:05:04.594]  Want to stop progress?
[02:05:04.834 --> 02:05:06.636]  Contact your local Progressive Democrat.
[02:05:06.836 --> 02:05:12.381]  With Airbnb rising in popularity, the hotel industry is freaking out and Progressive Democrats are responding.
[02:05:12.642 --> 02:05:18.227]  First, the Federal Trade Commission requested an investigation be done into how Airbnb was affecting the housing market.
[02:05:18.387 --> 02:05:25.949]  Why waste our money on that, I'm not sure, but Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo signed a bill making it a finable offense to post on Airbnb.
[02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:29.990]  Another example of the government getting involved in private business where it doesn't belong.
[02:05:30.230 --> 02:05:36.631]  If you violate a lease, that is between you and your leaseholder, but now the government has a preemptive strike against the Airbnb host.
[02:05:36.871 --> 02:05:41.252]  You can be sure this is a result of the hotel industry lobbying our fine politicians.
[02:05:41.632 --> 02:05:44.373]  Linda Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the bill,
[02:05:44.713 --> 02:05:49.916]  ...said, this sets a standard for those struggling with the impact of Airbnb on affordable housing.
[02:05:50.097 --> 02:05:53.999]  Which doesn't even make sense because innovation and competition always lowers costs.
[02:05:54.199 --> 02:05:56.160]  But these are Democrats we're talking about here.
[02:05:56.341 --> 02:05:58.362]  So don't bother trying to progress an industry.
[02:05:58.582 --> 02:06:00.683]  Progressive Democrats are waiting to stop you.
[02:06:00.863 --> 02:06:02.945]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:06:03.485 --> 02:06:07.066]  I'm going to commit blasphemy against the globalists right now in the New World Order.
[02:06:07.986 --> 02:06:20.689]  I'm going to tell all of you that we're celebrating the Christian holiday of Easter, our risen Christ, on the third day by having some of the biggest specials ever at Infowarsstore.com on amazing supplements.
[02:06:21.129 --> 02:06:25.670]  You know, mainstream media demonizes us for selling high-quality organic supplements that are game changers.
[02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:30.593]  While they have all the poison big pharma drug ads all day sitting there poisoning the people.
[02:06:30.893 --> 02:06:33.334]  What a shameful group of wicked devils.
[02:06:33.975 --> 02:06:38.177]  Ladies and gentlemen, our Christ raised from the dead on the third day.
[02:06:39.318 --> 02:06:46.122]  And our republic can rise from the dead if we wake up to what the globalists are doing and if you support independent free media.
[02:06:46.542 --> 02:06:50.905]  There's never been a better time to support InfoWars with these specials at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:51.325 --> 02:06:52.626]  Because it's all about life.
[02:06:53.246 --> 02:07:00.823]  Get the products, whether it's water filtration, nutraceuticals, Patriot apparel, you name it, it's all available at MFulwhoreStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:05.283]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:07:05.343 --> 02:07:06.404]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:07:06.664 --> 02:07:07.585]  Why is this so good?
[02:07:07.885 --> 02:07:13.109]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:07:13.209 --> 02:07:26.759]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:07:26.819 --> 02:07:28.200]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:30.562]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:07:30.622 --> 02:07:33.104]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:07:33.204 --> 02:07:34.465]  These are all parasites.
[02:07:34.505 --> 02:07:35.606]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:07:35.626 --> 02:07:36.667]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:07:36.968 --> 02:07:41.312]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bug, the organic wormwood.
[02:07:41.492 --> 02:07:44.675]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:07:44.735 --> 02:07:47.836]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:07:47.856 --> 02:07:48.857]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:07:48.917 --> 02:07:50.798]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:50.858 --> 02:07:51.898]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:07:52.178 --> 02:07:53.979]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:07:54.599 --> 02:07:57.621]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:57.881 --> 02:07:59.782]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:08:00.162 --> 02:08:02.123]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:08:05.475 --> 02:08:08.518]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:09.078 --> 02:08:13.222]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:31.564]  And we're back, live!
[02:08:31.624 --> 02:08:34.067]  It's the third hour of the Alex Jones Show here.
[02:08:34.547 --> 02:08:40.695]  Live in studio with us is Mike Cernovich, DangerAndPlay.com, Guerrilla Mindset, MAGA Mindset.
[02:08:41.256 --> 02:08:42.237]  Mike, welcome back!
[02:08:43.024 --> 02:08:43.865]  I'm with Paul the Great.
[02:08:43.965 --> 02:08:45.687]  I'm going to start calling PJW.
[02:08:45.727 --> 02:08:47.029]  I used to call him PJW.
[02:08:47.129 --> 02:08:49.212]  I'm now calling him Paul the Great.
[02:08:49.252 --> 02:08:51.354]  That's the hashtag we're starting, Paul the Great.
[02:08:51.394 --> 02:08:53.096]  We want Paul to believe in his own greatness.
[02:08:53.637 --> 02:08:54.658]  Paul is the greatest.
[02:08:55.019 --> 02:08:57.922]  We need PJW to own his own greatness.
[02:08:57.962 --> 02:08:59.845]  Yes, we had an intervention last night.
[02:08:59.905 --> 02:09:01.086]  I said, Paul,
[02:09:01.807 --> 02:09:03.968]  I go, some people think they believe their own hype.
[02:09:04.209 --> 02:09:05.389]  You don't believe your hype enough.
[02:09:05.789 --> 02:09:07.010]  You're greater than you accept.
[02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:08.351]  You have to embrace your own young greatness.
[02:09:08.371 --> 02:09:08.871]  I'm British though.
[02:09:09.131 --> 02:09:09.612]  Exactly.
[02:09:09.652 --> 02:09:10.672]  I'm self-deprecating.
[02:09:10.712 --> 02:09:15.355]  Right, so I had to stage a mindset intervention on him because he said, well, I'm British.
[02:09:15.415 --> 02:09:16.216]  And I go, I don't care.
[02:09:16.316 --> 02:09:18.557]  You're going to define yourself however you want to define yourself.
[02:09:18.877 --> 02:09:23.020]  Those of you who, you know, fans of PJW, we're now calling him Paul the Great.
[02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:24.060]  There you go.
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:24.881]  There's a hashtag.
[02:09:25.201 --> 02:09:26.242]  Let's get that trending.
[02:09:26.722 --> 02:09:28.883]  Mike, you've been in Austin for a few days now.
[02:09:28.923 --> 02:09:29.804]  How have you found it?
[02:09:30.464 --> 02:09:31.004]  Food's great.
[02:09:31.504 --> 02:09:32.785]  Too much barbecue though, man.
[02:09:32.965 --> 02:09:39.827]  Sodium, I gotta find a sauna and get like five pounds of this water weight from all the sodium from all the barbecue.
[02:09:40.187 --> 02:09:46.229]  It's good, but you know, I got to meet the liberals at an anti-Trump rally, which was a lot of fun.
[02:09:46.529 --> 02:09:47.130]  That was fun.
[02:09:47.930 --> 02:09:50.611]  We got to get them all riled up, all fired up.
[02:09:50.671 --> 02:09:51.971]  We had a big meetup yesterday.
[02:09:51.991 --> 02:09:54.012]  A lot of people, those of you listening in Austin,
[02:09:54.744 --> 02:09:55.424]  You are not alone.
[02:09:55.944 --> 02:09:58.365]  The fake news media wants you to believe that you're isolated.
[02:09:59.265 --> 02:10:03.306]  And even in a liberal enclave like Austin, Texas, I just had an informal happy hour.
[02:10:03.326 --> 02:10:06.067]  I didn't even announce the event in advance.
[02:10:06.267 --> 02:10:08.647]  I didn't even tell people where it was going to be until like two hours before.
[02:10:08.667 --> 02:10:09.928]  Just a single tweet, right?
[02:10:09.968 --> 02:10:11.308]  You've got like 75 people.
[02:10:11.328 --> 02:10:11.748]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:10:12.088 --> 02:10:13.809]  Off and on, 75 to 100 actually.
[02:10:13.849 --> 02:10:15.629]  People just kept pouring in.
[02:10:15.649 --> 02:10:16.830]  It was incredible.
[02:10:16.890 --> 02:10:18.970]  So don't listen to the fake news media.
[02:10:19.150 --> 02:10:21.671]  There are us everywhere.
[02:10:21.771 --> 02:10:22.331]  We are everywhere.
[02:10:23.069 --> 02:10:24.411]  Now let's get into the big story, Mike.
[02:10:24.471 --> 02:10:26.514]  Obviously it broke late last night.
[02:10:26.895 --> 02:10:30.480]  You put it up on Medium, it was on your Twitter, we've got it up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:10:31.368 --> 02:10:33.069]  Google, this is a massive story.
[02:10:33.089 --> 02:10:34.991]  We've seen them manipulate elections.
[02:10:35.051 --> 02:10:38.974]  They had studies where they could manipulate simply by altering their algorithm.
[02:10:39.254 --> 02:10:42.137]  Up to 80 million undecided voters.
[02:10:42.157 --> 02:10:43.658]  They're doing it again in France.
[02:10:43.738 --> 02:10:48.222]  They're educating the French people on trust, on fake news.
[02:10:48.762 --> 02:10:53.646]  Now we have evidence of them directly targeting Infowars.com.
[02:10:53.686 --> 02:10:54.407]  Break it down for us.
[02:10:54.807 --> 02:10:56.929]  Right, so we'll start from the beginning.
[02:10:56.969 --> 02:11:02.675]  A lot of people, when you want to learn about a new subject, what you do is you type in, you know, whatever the subject is.
[02:11:03.175 --> 02:11:04.917]  Paul Joseph Watson, boom, you go into Google.
[02:11:05.277 --> 02:11:16.188]  What turns up in Google is based on an algorithm that Google wants to keep pure because that way they can go to advertisers and other people and say we don't manipulate search results manually.
[02:11:16.609 --> 02:11:17.410]  In fact, when
[02:11:18.130 --> 02:11:29.764]  There was a story that had broke several months before the election that Google had been caught manipulating this algorithm and they freaked out because this big business, billions of dollars at stake, they want people to believe that they don't manipulate their algorithms.
[02:11:29.784 --> 02:11:30.324]  So what did they do?
[02:11:31.289 --> 02:11:36.172]  I got this tip from a very reliable source who works for Search Engine Integrity.
[02:11:36.652 --> 02:11:40.274]  These are the people who go through and they manually rate every article.
[02:11:40.314 --> 02:11:44.696]  So if they rate the article high, then the article is going to show up on page one of Google.
[02:11:45.036 --> 02:11:48.858]  Because remember, the war on Google is you want to be on page one Google.
[02:11:48.899 --> 02:11:51.700]  You want to be the number one result on Google for whatever it is.
[02:11:52.721 --> 02:11:58.884]  So what they're doing now is they want to manually, and they've been instructed to, everybody who does this has been instructed,
[02:11:59.651 --> 02:12:12.920]  To rate every article from Infowars.com, no matter how true it is, no matter how confirmed it is, to rate it as a low-quality article, what this will do is prevent Infowars from being on the first page of Google for any search result.
[02:12:13.863 --> 02:12:17.524]  And when it happened with Facebook's trending list, it was a huge scandal.
[02:12:17.564 --> 02:12:29.987]  They had to apologize, they had to have big meetings with Glenn Beck of all people, but several conservative commentators, they had to promise that they would change it, that it wouldn't be partisan, that it wouldn't be manipulated.
[02:12:30.387 --> 02:12:32.068]  Now it's happening with Google, but Mike,
[02:12:32.728 --> 02:12:34.049]  Google's a private company.
[02:12:34.089 --> 02:12:35.429]  They can do whatever they want, right?
[02:12:35.630 --> 02:12:36.630]  Yeah, they're a private company.
[02:12:36.650 --> 02:12:37.370]  They can do whatever they want.
[02:12:37.451 --> 02:12:38.431]  Okay, great, sure.
[02:12:38.831 --> 02:12:39.612]  I'm a private person.
[02:12:39.752 --> 02:12:40.432]  I can do whatever I want.
[02:12:40.532 --> 02:12:41.333]  I can complain about it.
[02:12:41.353 --> 02:12:42.113]  I can criticize it.
[02:12:42.453 --> 02:12:44.174]  We can use the power of the free market.
[02:12:44.214 --> 02:12:48.896]  This is what cracks me up, where all these really weak-minded, they go, oh, Google's a private company.
[02:12:48.916 --> 02:12:49.817]  They can do whatever they want.
[02:12:50.558 --> 02:12:54.262]  Okay, then why are you complaining about me criticizing Google, right?
[02:12:54.602 --> 02:13:04.491]  So why do you criticize me for criticizing a massive, globalist, multi-billion dollar corporation, and moreover this idea that they're a private company is belied by a couple points.
[02:13:04.992 --> 02:13:09.156]  One, Eric Schmidt conspired with Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[02:13:09.256 --> 02:13:11.218]  Hillary Clinton obviously was trying to be president.
[02:13:11.278 --> 02:13:12.339]  She was Secretary of State.
[02:13:12.819 --> 02:13:14.561]  Eric Schmidt had conspired with Barack Obama.
[02:13:15.121 --> 02:13:19.002]  So there is a conspiracy with Google and with the government.
[02:13:19.142 --> 02:13:21.883]  So if you're doing that, you now can't say you're a private corporation.
[02:13:21.903 --> 02:13:23.864]  You're a quasi-governmental entity.
[02:13:24.004 --> 02:13:24.124]  One.
[02:13:25.024 --> 02:13:29.106]  Two is that they keep going to
[02:13:30.726 --> 02:13:33.508]  Congress asking for things, asking for favors.
[02:13:33.869 --> 02:13:37.832]  This idea that they're just some private company mom-and-pop shop, right?
[02:13:38.233 --> 02:13:38.993]  It cracks me up.
[02:13:39.133 --> 02:13:41.355]  Oh my god, they're just a private mom-and-pop shop.
[02:13:41.776 --> 02:13:43.037]  You know, you can't criticize them.
[02:13:43.297 --> 02:13:44.838]  These people hire lobbyists.
[02:13:44.858 --> 02:13:47.340]  They spend millions of dollars lobbying the government.
[02:13:47.741 --> 02:13:49.222]  It's not just some private company.
[02:13:49.262 --> 02:13:50.503]  That's such a joke of an argument.
[02:13:50.523 --> 02:13:56.726]  And remember the scandal where you would type in Hillary Clinton is to the different search engines before the election.
[02:13:57.166 --> 02:14:02.508]  Bing, Yahoo, Hillary Clinton is, the auto suggestion would pop up a criminal.
[02:14:03.168 --> 02:14:04.889]  Google, you didn't get that.
[02:14:04.929 --> 02:14:11.972]  You got the same on every other single search engine because they were fair, they were neutral, they were just putting out what was put in, what was being inputted.
[02:14:12.412 --> 02:14:13.053]  With Hillary,
[02:14:14.133 --> 02:14:16.197]  It was all censored, it was all sanitized.
[02:14:16.217 --> 02:14:18.320]  Hillary's good, Hillary's moral, right?
[02:14:18.661 --> 02:14:22.928]  Exactly, and that led to a big outcry and then Google said, we would never manipulate.
[02:14:23.871 --> 02:14:25.912]  We would never manipulate our search results manually.
[02:14:26.012 --> 02:14:27.994]  Even though they were caught doing it, flagrantly.
[02:14:28.134 --> 02:14:29.675]  And now they're caught doing it again.
[02:14:29.695 --> 02:14:31.656]  That email was a mass email.
[02:14:31.696 --> 02:14:34.578]  The source told me, because I at first said, well, hey, can I post this?
[02:14:34.598 --> 02:14:36.099]  Are you going to get, you know, docs are blown up?
[02:14:36.139 --> 02:14:36.899]  And he goes, no, no, no.
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:41.162]  It went out to hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of people.
[02:14:41.202 --> 02:14:42.583]  So it was a mass email.
[02:14:42.863 --> 02:14:52.770]  So if anybody in the fake news wants to actually fact check it, just like I was right about Susan Rice, just like I was right about McMaster, just like PJW, Paul the Great, excuse me, and I were right about Hillary's health,
[02:14:53.450 --> 02:14:58.374]  You'll find out that this email went out to all of Google's contractors.
[02:14:58.734 --> 02:15:17.369]  You can find the email, so if you want to do some real journalism, rather than just write articles about Paul O'Great's tweets, my tweets, how about instead of writing about our tweets and acting like, oh my god, they tweeted something today, let's turn it into an article, how about you actually do some real journalism and hold these big, massive, multi-billion dollar corporations accountable.
[02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:18.790]  Speak truth to power.
[02:15:19.751 --> 02:15:23.013]  And the other issue, Mike, is on the private company argument.
[02:15:23.613 --> 02:15:24.273]  It's not.
[02:15:24.353 --> 02:15:25.154]  It's a monopoly.
[02:15:25.174 --> 02:15:27.935]  I mean, come on, Google is basically the internet at this point.
[02:15:28.295 --> 02:15:33.137]  If you manipulate that, you know, it's the equivalent... It is a telecommunications company at this point.
[02:15:33.197 --> 02:15:33.998]  It's a service.
[02:15:34.058 --> 02:15:35.779]  It's a public utility, almost.
[02:15:36.139 --> 02:15:38.460]  It would be like cutting someone's electricity off.
[02:15:38.940 --> 02:15:42.042]  If they had the wrong opinions at this point, it's got to that level.
[02:15:42.383 --> 02:15:48.447]  These social media companies, Google included, have said they want to be treated as public utilities.
[02:15:48.707 --> 02:15:57.394]  But then when they actually behave in a way that is manipulative, partisan, and they get called out on it, then they're just a private company again.
[02:15:57.414 --> 02:15:58.315]  You can't have it both ways.
[02:15:58.375 --> 02:15:59.195]  Right, right, exactly.
[02:15:59.235 --> 02:16:02.177]  So what Paula Gray is talking about is how
[02:16:03.198 --> 02:16:11.583]  Your cell phone company can't say, oh, I don't like how Cernovich uses Twitter, I don't like that he's so effective and he's world famous and is really taking on the establishment.
[02:16:12.103 --> 02:16:14.065]  I'm just going to deny him cell phone service.
[02:16:14.425 --> 02:16:22.149]  As a utility, you have to let people use your internet because they're all using infrastructure that was created in the public interest.
[02:16:22.169 --> 02:16:24.551]  They're all using that kind of infrastructure, okay?
[02:16:24.831 --> 02:16:28.733]  So Google, Twitter, and all those companies go, so that's what I mean by a public utility.
[02:16:29.113 --> 02:16:31.295]  The water company here can't say, well, we don't like
[02:16:32.073 --> 02:16:32.454]  I don't know.
[02:16:42.507 --> 02:16:46.169]  And Twitter and other social media companies have said, well, yeah, we're like a public utility.
[02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:52.172]  We are like a water company because there's great power in being treated like utility.
[02:16:52.492 --> 02:16:57.594]  If you're a corporation and you're treated like utility, the government won't regulate you under antitrust law.
[02:16:57.614 --> 02:16:59.215]  There's all these little perks that you get.
[02:16:59.755 --> 02:17:08.020]  Well, the flip side to that is you cannot manipulate your coverage or manipulate utility to go after people you disagree with or go after political adversaries.
[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:10.821]  You have to treat everybody equally under the same rules.
[02:17:11.261 --> 02:17:15.105]  And if you go back to the article you just had up on screen, this was a few weeks ago.
[02:17:15.285 --> 02:17:16.666]  In fact, it was last month, I believe.
[02:17:17.027 --> 02:17:20.670]  They were caught delisting and relegating content.
[02:17:21.251 --> 02:17:27.216]  It was basically quite a prominent commentator who had put up a website about the religion of peace, Islam.
[02:17:27.637 --> 02:17:29.919]  She quoted passages out of the Quran.
[02:17:30.339 --> 02:17:35.401]  Made the point that these aren't peaceful passages, killing all the infidels, etc.
[02:17:35.741 --> 02:17:42.644]  And they use that as the example, upsetting offensive, to tell the truth about this belief system.
[02:17:43.044 --> 02:17:45.465]  That is relegated on Google.
[02:17:45.505 --> 02:17:48.286]  That is not going to be on the first page where as it was before.
[02:17:48.646 --> 02:17:50.086]  That's what they're doing with InfoWars.
[02:17:50.507 --> 02:17:52.587]  Mike, they directly mention InfoWars.
[02:17:52.607 --> 02:17:56.589]  This isn't just a general vague, oh we're clamping down on fake news or whatever.
[02:17:56.929 --> 02:17:59.770]  InfoWars is the example mentioned in the document, right?
[02:17:59.770 --> 02:18:00.010]  No, no, 100%.
[02:18:00.511 --> 02:18:03.715]  That is why immediately when I got it, I said, I have to break this story.
[02:18:04.136 --> 02:18:09.383]  Last night, even though I had a big dinner with friends and, you know, I'd hung out and had this huge meetup, met all these people.
[02:18:09.824 --> 02:18:12.267]  The day before, you know, somebody tried to sucker punch me.
[02:18:12.327 --> 02:18:12.868]  I had to hit him.
[02:18:13.249 --> 02:18:14.931]  It's been a busy week for me.
[02:18:15.672 --> 02:18:22.317]  But on Sunday night, because I view this as not only an attack on InfoWars, it is an attack on everybody listening and watching.
[02:18:22.657 --> 02:18:26.439]  If they take down InfoWars, we're all done.
[02:18:26.780 --> 02:18:27.941]  None of us are safe.
[02:18:28.081 --> 02:18:29.602]  This is the way I read it.
[02:18:29.762 --> 02:18:31.703]  I didn't say this is an attack on InfoWars.
[02:18:32.103 --> 02:18:33.404]  I go, this is an attack on me.
[02:18:33.905 --> 02:18:39.589]  Because InfoWars is on the vanguard, and if they can take down InfoWars, they can take down everybody.
[02:18:39.809 --> 02:18:41.010]  Nobody have free speech.
[02:18:41.090 --> 02:18:42.671]  Nobody listening here will have free speech.
[02:18:43.601 --> 02:18:44.742]  Now what's the solution, Mike?
[02:18:44.762 --> 02:18:52.605]  You were talking last night about flash mobs, about getting people physically out in front of Google headquarters and speaking truth to power.
[02:18:53.406 --> 02:18:54.666]  As you can see, I'm fired up.
[02:18:54.906 --> 02:19:00.529]  I was talking to some people, and I'm not going to tell you who I was talking to because I don't know if they've mentioned what had happened in the meeting we had, but...
[02:19:01.229 --> 02:19:02.711]  Look, it goes like this.
[02:19:03.151 --> 02:19:07.916]  We need to get 500 people, 1,000 people up to Google's headquarters and have a freedom rally.
[02:19:08.396 --> 02:19:16.184]  We need to get Paul the Great's people, my people, all the Infowars, everybody listening here, we need to have a big, big, big, peaceful
[02:19:16.724 --> 02:19:27.434]  Friendly party in front of Google headquarters to support free speech, to support the right of everybody to have equal treatment under these utility rules.
[02:19:27.495 --> 02:19:31.979]  Because again, they said they wanted to be treated like utility, so now we're going to hold them to their word.
[02:19:32.957 --> 02:19:35.378]  I imagine, I imagine this... Oh, we're going out?
[02:19:35.638 --> 02:19:36.578]  We got 30 seconds.
[02:19:36.918 --> 02:19:38.118]  I imagine a big party.
[02:19:38.378 --> 02:19:39.118]  We need to plan it.
[02:19:39.198 --> 02:19:40.099]  I want 500 people.
[02:19:40.179 --> 02:19:41.319]  I want 1,000 people.
[02:19:41.739 --> 02:19:42.479]  Microphones.
[02:19:42.799 --> 02:19:43.919]  I want everybody there.
[02:19:44.420 --> 02:19:45.200]  Have a good time.
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:46.400]  Peacefully in front of Google.
[02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:47.380]  More on that after the break.
[02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:54.862]  We will be back in the next segment to talk about Antifa, to talk about conservatives being directly targeted with Mike Cernovich.
[02:19:54.942 --> 02:19:56.522]  DangerAndPlay.com.
[02:19:56.682 --> 02:19:57.682]  Huge news coming up.
[02:19:57.923 --> 02:19:59.263]  Infowars.com.
[02:19:59.303 --> 02:19:59.763]  We'll be back.
[02:20:07.805 --> 02:20:14.250]  Russia unveiled a Satan 2 missile that could wipe out France or Texas with the type of megaton weapons it carries.
[02:20:14.610 --> 02:20:15.571]  Multiple ones, by the way.
[02:20:15.611 --> 02:20:18.012]  And of course, there's a lot more advanced stuff than that.
[02:20:18.032 --> 02:20:26.499]  They admitted the Air Force by the 90s developed antimatter bombs that would destroy... They theoretically tested them, they would destroy most of the solar system.
[02:20:27.399 --> 02:20:28.240]  What's the point of that?
[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:29.180]  I don't know.
[02:20:29.781 --> 02:20:33.203]  But we're reaching that Atlantis moment, whether Atlantis existed or not.
[02:20:33.763 --> 02:20:38.306]  In the fable of Atlantis, the legend, they get some super technology that blows the whole island up.
[02:20:38.946 --> 02:20:41.347]  And Plato lived only, you know, a few thousand years after.
[02:20:41.407 --> 02:20:41.848]  He said, no.
[02:20:42.148 --> 02:20:43.529]  He had the animals, the books about it.
[02:20:43.749 --> 02:20:44.129]  It happened.
[02:20:44.149 --> 02:20:47.171]  But whether that was real or not, folks, we're now at the Atlantis moment.
[02:20:47.471 --> 02:20:49.272]  Michael Snyder, you know, I don't know if you have kids.
[02:20:49.652 --> 02:20:51.694]  I have children, especially my little daughters.
[02:20:51.814 --> 02:20:55.616]  And I see this news, and I see how sweet they are, and it really makes me angry.
[02:20:57.364 --> 02:20:59.185]  Yeah, I don't want war either, Alex.
[02:20:59.265 --> 02:21:01.706]  And that's why I'm so alarmed by what's happened this week.
[02:21:01.746 --> 02:21:05.428]  We already talked about how North Korea could potentially spark a war with China.
[02:21:05.468 --> 02:21:08.689]  Well, the situation with Syria, if it was just Syria, wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[02:21:08.849 --> 02:21:11.530]  And Trump could do whatever he wanted if it was just Syria.
[02:21:11.850 --> 02:21:12.951]  But the Russians are there.
[02:21:13.351 --> 02:21:17.973]  And the Russians are mixed in among the Syrian forces, and they're at the Syrian air bases in particular.
[02:21:18.313 --> 02:21:27.537]  So Trump, with his words and the members of his administration in recent days, they've kind of committed themselves to taking some sort of action in response to this false flag chemical attack.
[02:21:27.798 --> 02:21:29.178]  But they've kind of committed themselves.
[02:21:29.218 --> 02:21:37.682]  But if they do anything, and the bombs start dropping, and the Russians, their people are being killed, their force is under threat, are the Russians just going to sit there and do nothing?
[02:21:38.002 --> 02:21:39.123]  Or are they going to respond?
[02:21:39.503 --> 02:21:41.063]  I believe the Russians would start responding.
[02:21:41.083 --> 02:21:42.124]  They would start shooting back.
[02:21:42.284 --> 02:21:44.785]  And so what happens if, okay, U.S.
[02:21:44.825 --> 02:21:50.108]  warplanes go in, they start bombing, and then Russian missiles, the S-300 starts taking U.S.
[02:21:50.168 --> 02:21:54.371]  airplanes out, we start seeing F-16s fall out of the sky on CNN.
[02:21:54.651 --> 02:21:59.674]  What's that going to do to the anti-Russian hysteria in Washington that's already at Cold War heights?
[02:22:00.034 --> 02:22:01.395]  I mean, it's just going to be insane.
[02:22:01.695 --> 02:22:08.599]  But you have this situation, and of course we've got Iran in Syria, we've got Hezbollah in Syria, and there's nothing to be gained in there.
[02:22:08.679 --> 02:22:10.500]  You know, there's so much that could go wrong.
[02:22:10.740 --> 02:22:12.302]  We don't want a conflict with Iran.
[02:22:12.322 --> 02:22:14.424]  We don't even want a conflict with Hezbollah.
[02:22:14.444 --> 02:22:15.645]  They're pretty serious.
[02:22:15.985 --> 02:22:17.306]  But especially with Russia.
[02:22:17.446 --> 02:22:19.928]  Our relationship with Russia is already quite tenuous.
[02:22:20.489 --> 02:22:29.037]  And if we go in and dead bodies of Russian service members start showing up on Russian television, you know, the Russians are going to totally turn against Trump.
[02:22:30.538 --> 02:22:31.359]  Yeah, Russia doesn't back down.
[02:22:31.399 --> 02:22:32.299]  Russia is not intimidated by anyone.
[02:22:32.319 --> 02:22:34.601]  The Russians, historically, are fighters.
[02:22:34.661 --> 02:22:38.644]  And so, you know, we had hoped that with Trump coming in, we could have a better relationship with Russia.
[02:22:38.864 --> 02:22:40.966]  But this thing with Syria could actually make it far, far worse.
[02:23:05.742 --> 02:23:07.083]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[02:23:07.143 --> 02:23:08.463]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:23:09.384 --> 02:23:09.744]  Great!
[02:23:09.844 --> 02:23:10.845]  Hey, thank you so much.
[02:23:10.965 --> 02:23:15.347]  Listen, I have bought your products, and I gotta say they're amazing.
[02:23:15.507 --> 02:23:17.068]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[02:23:17.188 --> 02:23:24.652]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[02:23:24.772 --> 02:23:25.633]  Wow, thank you.
[02:23:25.653 --> 02:23:27.934]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[02:23:27.994 --> 02:23:29.615]  Which Nutraceutical does you like best?
[02:23:29.835 --> 02:23:33.137]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[02:23:33.297 --> 02:23:33.797]  That's amazing.
[02:23:33.957 --> 02:23:38.021]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:23:38.061 --> 02:23:39.001]  It's a win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[02:24:24.321 --> 02:24:27.503]  We are back on the Alex Jones Show with Mike Cernovich.
[02:24:27.523 --> 02:24:31.546]  We're going to delve back into Google and related topics in a second.
[02:24:31.586 --> 02:24:38.711]  First, I want to tell you about the specials we have at infowarsstore.com, the Easter Mega Specials Extended.
[02:24:39.471 --> 02:24:42.873]  For a limited time only, 30% off BrainForce.
[02:24:42.933 --> 02:24:44.333]  That is the one I'm taking.
[02:24:44.353 --> 02:24:50.656]  I'm on it right now with jet lag and two hours sleep, and it's working absolute wonders.
[02:24:50.676 --> 02:24:51.637]  30% off BrainForce.
[02:24:52.157 --> 02:24:54.618]  This gives you energy, mental clarity.
[02:24:54.958 --> 02:25:02.142]  It doesn't give you that junk, buzzy feeling, that bad-after feeling that you get from some similar nootropic products.
[02:25:02.202 --> 02:25:03.963]  It is BrainForce at 30% off.
[02:25:04.543 --> 02:25:12.606]  At Infowarsstore.com, super male vitality, 25% off, several other massive discounts.
[02:25:12.826 --> 02:25:18.767]  Infowarsstore.com, we're under constant sustained attack from the establishment every single day.
[02:25:19.088 --> 02:25:25.109]  We're not beholden to the same interests they are, which is why we have complete autonomy over our message.
[02:25:25.449 --> 02:25:26.770]  We're beholden only to you.
[02:25:27.270 --> 02:25:35.171]  And we appreciate your support by getting the products at infowarsstore.com, with those specials extended for a limited time only.
[02:25:35.611 --> 02:25:38.812]  Huge discounts, infowarsstore.com.
[02:25:39.572 --> 02:25:41.412]  Mike, we're back!
[02:25:41.472 --> 02:25:43.073]  Yeah, it's so important.
[02:25:43.833 --> 02:25:47.273]  Even if people don't take supplements, if you use toothpaste, buy the toothpaste.
[02:25:47.473 --> 02:25:52.674]  And by the way, I'm not paid to be here, just so everybody knows, but that's the whole thing.
[02:25:53.274 --> 02:25:54.255]  Buy your toothpaste.
[02:25:54.315 --> 02:25:56.195]  You've got to realize it's a direct attack.
[02:25:56.855 --> 02:25:58.636]  They've cut off the Google Adsense.
[02:25:59.016 --> 02:26:01.377]  They're losing five million dollars.
[02:26:01.517 --> 02:26:02.518]  I took a tour of this place.
[02:26:02.538 --> 02:26:03.598]  I couldn't believe how big it is.
[02:26:03.939 --> 02:26:05.279]  They're expanding the operations.
[02:26:05.419 --> 02:26:10.042]  I'm not being paid for being here to say this, but I believe that you have to support people who are supporting you.
[02:26:10.062 --> 02:26:15.685]  So even people who don't want to take the supplements, or maybe they don't want to take that for whatever reason, everybody needs toothpaste.
[02:26:16.245 --> 02:26:17.025]  Get the toothpaste.
[02:26:17.165 --> 02:26:19.987]  Every little thing that people do, nothing you do is too small.
[02:26:20.107 --> 02:26:21.487]  Even if all you do is share a link, too.
[02:26:21.507 --> 02:26:22.268]  That's what I tell people.
[02:26:22.808 --> 02:26:30.654]  If Google wants to shut people down, share links, buy toothpaste, buy the supplements, don't ever feel insignificant, don't ever feel like you're not doing enough.
[02:26:30.874 --> 02:26:42.703]  Every little thing you do helps because if everybody, if all the tens of millions of people in America, the freedom fighters, all unite, and even if they only do one quote-unquote little thing, you have a massive, massive tsunami of support.
[02:26:43.365 --> 02:26:45.826]  Mike, we got this breaking article at Infowars.com.
[02:26:45.886 --> 02:26:49.448]  Google RoboTool flags conservative comments as toxic.
[02:26:49.468 --> 02:26:53.430]  So it's not just the content of the article, now it's the comments as well.
[02:26:54.150 --> 02:26:59.113]  Major mainstream news websites have removed their comment sections altogether.
[02:26:59.313 --> 02:27:03.075]  That's been happening for years now, and it's because, and they've done studies on this,
[02:27:03.755 --> 02:27:12.105]  The comments have more impact, have more influence on how the reader judges the content than the content of the article itself.
[02:27:12.545 --> 02:27:17.331]  That's why they've declared war on comment sections, because again, they're losing the debate.
[02:27:17.691 --> 02:27:21.316]  So now the Google AI tool used to flag offensive comments,
[02:27:21.736 --> 02:27:25.939]  As a seemingly built-in bias against conservative and libertarian viewpoints.
[02:27:26.279 --> 02:27:34.284]  So if you're putting global warming is fake, it's 39% toxic compared to only 2% toxic for global warming is real.
[02:27:34.584 --> 02:27:38.066]  That's how they decide which one gets censored.
[02:27:38.106 --> 02:27:40.848]  So they're now targeting the comments as well.
[02:27:41.528 --> 02:27:42.228]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:27:42.248 --> 02:27:47.290]  And that is why when I said earlier in the segment, this is not an attack on Alex Jones.
[02:27:47.770 --> 02:27:49.470]  This is an attack on everybody.
[02:27:49.791 --> 02:27:50.891]  You can't even leave comments.
[02:27:51.051 --> 02:27:52.531]  Somebody, I can't remember who said this.
[02:27:52.571 --> 02:27:53.872]  You can tell me maybe who said it is.
[02:27:53.892 --> 02:28:01.074]  They go, the election was the war against the commoners in the comment section versus the article itself.
[02:28:01.254 --> 02:28:06.717]  I can't remember who said that, but that was such an astute observation, which is that the people would speak out in populism.
[02:28:06.777 --> 02:28:09.279]  Populism is the new punk rock, it's the new counterculture.
[02:28:09.619 --> 02:28:13.262]  The people speaking out against this globalist elite, who are all on the payroll.
[02:28:13.642 --> 02:28:14.723]  They're all told what to say.
[02:28:15.043 --> 02:28:21.987]  I mean, that's why you know, you know, I don't even read all the articles about me, and I don't read any articles about the Paula Gray either, because they're all the same thing.
[02:28:22.407 --> 02:28:25.990]  Because they all take their talking points from their same owners, they're all owned
[02:28:26.590 --> 02:28:30.452]  By the same corporations, six corporations own 90% of all media.
[02:28:30.472 --> 02:28:33.394]  You can all look up media ownership and concentration.
[02:28:33.974 --> 02:28:48.202]  So what happened is, people would read an article, and it was a psychological war for your mind, because people read an article, and the article basically says, everybody who supports Trump is a neo-Nazi who hates women and probably, you know, commits domestic violence.
[02:28:48.762 --> 02:28:50.423]  And people read that and they go, I don't believe that.
[02:28:50.823 --> 02:28:52.184]  If you go to the comments section,
[02:28:52.964 --> 02:28:55.667]  You have people pushing back and now you feel connected.
[02:28:56.127 --> 02:28:57.969]  There's a human connection component to it.
[02:28:58.349 --> 02:29:01.452]  So the fake news people said, oh man, we better close the comments.
[02:29:01.512 --> 02:29:03.554]  We want people to feel isolated and alone.
[02:29:04.215 --> 02:29:11.121]  That is why community is so important and that is why we have to organize a big major event at Google headquarters.
[02:29:11.181 --> 02:29:11.642]  I'm thinking
[02:29:12.202 --> 02:29:25.409]  You know, if we have to bust people in, you know, we just need to get everybody who wants to speak for freedom and to stand up against this censoring the comments, against censoring the search results, microphones, podiums, you know, the A-list speakers.
[02:29:25.529 --> 02:29:26.149]  We need that.
[02:29:26.209 --> 02:29:29.131]  We need the people to show up in massive numbers and push back.
[02:29:29.491 --> 02:29:30.792]  And it's always one thing or the other.
[02:29:30.832 --> 02:29:44.380]  It's either no comments, because nobody's reading the article, or they're getting absolutely eviscerated in the comments, which is why those big mainstream news outlets have removed the section altogether, because that is having a huge influence.
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:49.904]  Now they're censoring it because of offensive comments made by conservatives.
[02:29:49.944 --> 02:29:50.504]  We'll be back.
[02:29:50.664 --> 02:29:51.324]  Stay right there.
[02:29:51.825 --> 02:29:52.705]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.186 --> 02:29:54.807]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.727 --> 02:29:58.409]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.392 --> 02:30:05.773]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:30:05.993 --> 02:30:10.797]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[02:30:11.257 --> 02:30:14.180]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:19.824]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:30:20.264 --> 02:30:25.969]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[02:30:26.269 --> 02:30:28.830]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[02:30:29.070 --> 02:30:34.192]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[02:30:34.452 --> 02:30:41.135]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[02:30:41.435 --> 02:30:46.017]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[02:30:46.157 --> 02:30:49.318]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[02:30:49.458 --> 02:30:51.359]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[02:30:51.539 --> 02:30:54.360]  Even better, use coupon code POWER at checkout.

[02:30:59.436 --> 02:31:01.121]  That's PrivatePowerGrid.com.
[02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:04.921]  You have no money?
[02:31:05.181 --> 02:31:07.142]  This is okay, we will take your blood.
[02:31:07.422 --> 02:31:12.765]  If you want access to the Vatican Museums, cash, visa, MasterCard, or needle is accepted.
[02:31:13.085 --> 02:31:16.427]  That's right, you can give blood to access the Vatican Museums.
[02:31:16.667 --> 02:31:21.189]  The blood payment plan has a slogan, give blood and follow your artistic inclination.
[02:31:21.449 --> 02:31:24.711]  Blood donors then receive a voucher which gives them access to the museums.
[02:31:25.071 --> 02:31:28.693]  The director of the Vatican Museums said, without blood there is no life.
[02:31:29.173 --> 02:31:31.634]  Without art, life would be empty and sad.
[02:31:32.334 --> 02:31:34.035]  Okay, I love Jesus, too.
[02:31:34.115 --> 02:31:34.795]  Happy Easter!
[02:31:35.515 --> 02:31:36.716]  I guess this is a good idea.
[02:31:37.156 --> 02:31:39.797]  Get some blood donations and allow people access to history.
[02:31:40.077 --> 02:31:41.437]  Sounds harmless, but wait.
[02:31:41.838 --> 02:31:44.398]  Each blood donation is good for a four-euro voucher.
[02:31:44.799 --> 02:31:47.179]  It costs sixteen euros to access the museums.
[02:31:47.880 --> 02:31:51.021]  So you have to donate blood four times before you can even get in.
[02:31:51.621 --> 02:31:54.182]  By the time you've given enough blood, you'd have fainted.
[02:31:55.003 --> 02:31:59.069]  Enjoy Michelangelo's Last Judgment as you recover from hypovolemia.
[02:31:59.589 --> 02:32:01.813]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[02:32:03.669 --> 02:32:07.231]  I'm going to commit blasphemy against the globalists right now in the New World Order.

[02:32:21.321 --> 02:32:25.864]  You know, mainstream media demonizes us for selling high-quality organic supplements that are game changers.
[02:32:26.184 --> 02:32:30.787]  Well, they have all the poison big pharma drug ads all day saying they're poisoning the people.
[02:32:31.067 --> 02:32:33.509]  What a shameful group of wicked devils.
[02:32:34.149 --> 02:32:38.351]  Ladies and gentlemen, our Christ raised from the dead on the third day.
[02:32:39.492 --> 02:32:46.295]  And our republic can rise from the dead if we wake up to what the globalists are doing and if you support independent free media.
[02:32:46.715 --> 02:32:51.057]  There's never been a better time to support InfoWars with these specials at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:51.497 --> 02:32:52.817]  Because it's all about life.

[02:33:24.247 --> 02:33:30.352]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.970 --> 02:33:36.930]  We are back live.
[02:33:36.990 --> 02:33:38.591]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:38.611 --> 02:33:40.291]  We're here with Mike Cernovich.
[02:33:40.371 --> 02:33:44.492]  The website is medium.com slash at Cernovich.
[02:33:44.572 --> 02:34:01.777]  That is where you will find all Mike's breaking news articles which in almost every occasion over the past few weeks or so get plagiarized by the mainstream media three days later and they give you zero credit but you're discredited, you're fake news even though they just copy the exact same story and claim credit for it.
[02:34:02.157 --> 02:34:03.738]  The website is medium.com slash
[02:34:05.499 --> 02:34:07.620]  Mike, I want to talk about a tweet.
[02:34:07.740 --> 02:34:13.024]  I mean, you put this story out before, but there was a tweet this morning by Jack Posibic, who's been on the show.
[02:34:13.864 --> 02:34:20.929]  He tweeted today about a seven figure contract for neocons to conduct crafted hit jobs on prominent Trump supporters.
[02:34:21.349 --> 02:34:24.772]  We saw it already with Milo back a couple of months ago.
[02:34:25.152 --> 02:34:27.093]  This is the Reagan battalion.
[02:34:27.133 --> 02:34:33.157]  This is basically, you know, they succeeded to some extent in enforcing Milo to back away a couple of months ago.
[02:34:33.538 --> 02:34:33.958]  Basically,
[02:34:34.438 --> 02:34:37.879]  Cowards who hide behind a Twitter account, they don't even show their face.
[02:34:37.919 --> 02:34:38.760]  But it's verified.
[02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:39.620]  How's it verified?
[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:40.220]  Exactly.
[02:34:40.580 --> 02:34:47.603]  They tweeted Saturday, this is what they tweeted, quote, we have been paid but told to work on Big Fish only.
[02:34:47.663 --> 02:34:54.425]  So they admit they're being paid to do hit pieces on prominent Trump-supporting commentators.
[02:34:54.865 --> 02:34:56.846]  My question is, Mike, paid by who?
[02:34:57.806 --> 02:35:07.415]  Yes, I explain to people they're they're being paid by the Saudi Arabians because the Saudis use this all goes back to McMaster and Petraeus.
[02:35:07.876 --> 02:35:16.024]  Petraeus has taken over control of the National Security Council and has been working to squeeze out Bannon and to hype up
[02:35:16.764 --> 02:35:17.084]  I think?
[02:35:28.157 --> 02:35:30.400]  So right now, what is going on?
[02:35:31.020 --> 02:35:36.687]  If you are people, I can tell you right now, if you tweet at me anything nice, there's going to be an army of shills.
[02:35:36.827 --> 02:35:42.613]  And I actually, I broke this story actually on Alex Jones about how all this money, a seven figure contract went out.
[02:35:43.054 --> 02:35:45.917]  So what they're doing is they're attacking and singling out people.
[02:35:46.878 --> 02:35:50.184]  One by one in an attempt to discredit and divide the movement.
[02:35:50.865 --> 02:35:57.555]  And some people, I'm not going to mention his name on camera because I don't want to give him more publicity because he's ineffective and a loser.
[02:35:57.936 --> 02:35:59.818]  He's also taking neocon money.
[02:36:00.319 --> 02:36:01.341]  And that is why.
[02:36:02.302 --> 02:36:03.963]  You see a lot of infighting.
[02:36:04.304 --> 02:36:08.947]  People like Paula Gray, people like me, we've been around for years, right?
[02:36:08.987 --> 02:36:10.968]  We didn't just surface because of the Trump thing.
[02:36:11.348 --> 02:36:22.516]  We have been around for years fighting for freedom, fighting for free speech, and then some people kind of got into it just because they could use Trump to build their brand, and now money is going out to those people.
[02:36:23.077 --> 02:36:24.178]  So there is a massive
[02:36:24.998 --> 02:36:26.679]  A public relations contract going out.
[02:36:26.719 --> 02:36:33.164]  They want to discredit everybody who opposes a massive ground war in the Middle East because there is so much money to be made in war.
[02:36:33.804 --> 02:36:40.049]  So much money to be made in fake news that people like us and their view are worth spending a million dollars to try to silence us.
[02:36:41.033 --> 02:36:46.739]  I know people, Mike, that are just up-and-coming people who have vice-writers approach them for interviews.
[02:36:46.779 --> 02:36:47.901]  They agree to the interview.
[02:36:48.321 --> 02:36:52.966]  Then they troll back through their personal Facebook pages years and years.
[02:36:53.046 --> 02:36:55.669]  And in this example, it was a young guy who works for the Rebel.
[02:36:56.050 --> 02:36:56.931]  He's only, what, 22, 23 years old.
[02:36:56.951 --> 02:36:57.371]  They trolled back.
[02:37:00.294 --> 02:37:13.578]  To 2011, 2012, found him in drunk photos on Facebook when he was a teenager having fun, asked him pointed questions, found his parents' name, dug into his parents' background.
[02:37:13.978 --> 02:37:16.679]  It was creepy, stalker-like behaviour.
[02:37:16.919 --> 02:37:25.041]  There seems to be this intense focus on not just up-and-coming people, prominent people, to try and personally attack them, bring them down.
[02:37:25.101 --> 02:37:29.282]  This seems like part of the full-frontal war that we're being subjected to right now.
[02:37:29.462 --> 02:37:30.563]  Yeah, it's totally creepy.
[02:37:30.883 --> 02:37:41.888]  I've had it done to me for years, so to me it's just another day at the office, people digging up stuff, photoshopping stuff, making up stuff that you never even said, taking things that were satirical and acting like that was actually meant literally.
[02:37:42.489 --> 02:37:44.350]  So I'm used to it every day and I think it's fun.
[02:37:44.850 --> 02:37:55.015]  I think it's fun, but if you're a 22-year-old and you're not really set financially, that's going to intimidate and scare off a lot of people because everybody has said something that they didn't mean.
[02:37:55.315 --> 02:37:58.197]  Maybe they had a little alcohol, maybe they weren't clear with their thoughts.
[02:37:59.177 --> 02:38:16.760]  So what they're doing is they're sending a message that anybody who's a freedom fighter, anybody who's standing up for what's right, anybody who's standing up for Americana, Americans and real Americans are going to have all of their worst moments broadcast to the world and they're going to treat your worst moment
[02:38:17.581 --> 02:38:19.482]  As if that is who they are as a person.
[02:38:19.863 --> 02:38:21.063]  It's quite disgusting.
[02:38:21.083 --> 02:38:22.384]  And they always have to troll back years.
[02:38:22.444 --> 02:38:24.606]  I mean, they did it with Tomi Lahren, right?
[02:38:24.646 --> 02:38:26.907]  And these young kids are like 23, 24.
[02:38:27.467 --> 02:38:31.750]  Of course they're going to have slightly embarrassing tweets from five years ago.
[02:38:32.110 --> 02:38:32.671]  Yeah, Tomi Lahren.
[02:38:32.711 --> 02:38:34.632]  It's not long since they were that age.
[02:38:34.692 --> 02:38:34.952]  They were 18, 19.
[02:38:35.152 --> 02:38:38.554]  Yeah, I mean, Tomi Lahren, they're like, oh, she was dancing on a table.
[02:38:38.634 --> 02:38:39.475]  Like, okay.
[02:38:39.875 --> 02:38:40.075]  So?
[02:38:40.176 --> 02:38:41.257]  Five years ago, big deal.
[02:38:41.317 --> 02:38:42.178]  Okay, yeah, big deal.
[02:38:42.198 --> 02:38:44.601]  She was in college, you know, maybe does a little bit of basic stuff.
[02:38:45.062 --> 02:38:46.824]  Nobody really cares, and that's what they do.
[02:38:46.864 --> 02:38:52.471]  And then, they also, what they'll do is, they'll take satirical stuff and then they'll treat it as literally true.
[02:38:52.932 --> 02:38:54.754]  That's like another, like, textbook game.
[02:38:54.774 --> 02:38:57.898]  So if you go, so one time I said like, oh, chemtrails are real kind of thing.
[02:38:58.679 --> 02:39:00.800]  And they'll say, oh, is that, what are you really saying here?
[02:39:00.820 --> 02:39:02.501]  It's like, come on guys, they're just memes.
[02:39:02.601 --> 02:39:04.322]  People talk about memes all the time.
[02:39:04.342 --> 02:39:10.526]  But they'll just say, even if you're trying to just be, just use memes, they'll try to use that against you.
[02:39:10.586 --> 02:39:12.687]  But again, for me, it's fun.
[02:39:13.347 --> 02:39:15.829]  I get a rush out of it because I enjoy conflict.
[02:39:16.249 --> 02:39:17.349]  I enjoy when they're attacking me.
[02:39:17.389 --> 02:39:19.911]  It just reminds me that I'm winning and they're losing.
[02:39:20.411 --> 02:39:23.153]  Paula Great's doing like 250 million views every month.
[02:39:23.193 --> 02:39:23.593]  I'm doing like 150.
[02:39:23.633 --> 02:39:25.474]  I mean, if you think about it,
[02:39:25.914 --> 02:39:28.577]  These people who hate on us, they can't get a retweet.
[02:39:29.098 --> 02:39:30.739]  They can't get a like.
[02:39:30.759 --> 02:39:31.620]  They don't resonate.
[02:39:31.660 --> 02:39:32.702]  They have zero audience.
[02:39:33.082 --> 02:39:34.263]  I mean, I've done a running thing.
[02:39:34.503 --> 02:39:38.007]  Every time I visit Austin, I go out and meet Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:39:38.308 --> 02:39:40.770]  We take a picture as if we're a couple on a date.
[02:39:41.111 --> 02:39:42.012]  It's a running joke.
[02:39:42.532 --> 02:39:45.273]  The next day there's already a YouTube video with 10,000 views.
[02:39:45.833 --> 02:39:47.773]  Secret gay relationship exposed.
[02:39:47.813 --> 02:39:48.873]  It's just hilarious!
[02:39:49.013 --> 02:39:51.154]  You can bait these people so easily as well.
[02:39:51.174 --> 02:39:55.674]  Yeah, well they did that when you were in, I think, Budapest and you go, we're checking out the gay nightlife thing.
[02:39:55.994 --> 02:39:59.955]  And then suddenly, you know, there's a whole articles, oh yeah, he's really gay.
[02:40:00.075 --> 02:40:02.055]  First of all, like, who cares?
[02:40:02.556 --> 02:40:03.456]  One is like, who cares?
[02:40:03.516 --> 02:40:04.916]  Why is this newsworthy?
[02:40:05.276 --> 02:40:10.057]  Why is it that everything that he tweets or I tweet, why is it somehow a news cycle?
[02:40:10.957 --> 02:40:12.839]  Think up a real story.
[02:40:12.899 --> 02:40:14.000]  Yeah, like Google.
[02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:19.484]  The real research is Google is now manipulating its search results to push a narrative.
[02:40:19.945 --> 02:40:21.266]  That's a real story.
[02:40:21.626 --> 02:40:24.649]  And then, I don't know if we wanted to talk about how Wall Street Journal plagiarized.
[02:40:24.769 --> 02:40:25.750]  There's so much news, guys.
[02:40:25.770 --> 02:40:30.434]  This is the thing about why it's so fun to be alive and why they're trying to discredit us.
[02:40:30.814 --> 02:40:33.076]  We talked about the stories we're going to talk about.
[02:40:33.116 --> 02:40:35.198]  There's so much going on, we can't even cover it all.
[02:40:35.876 --> 02:40:39.558]  We need more truth tellers to join the fight, and that is why they're attacking you.
[02:40:39.578 --> 02:40:41.700]  So every day the fake news media is going after you.
[02:40:41.740 --> 02:40:46.363]  Support these people, because it's demoralizing for people who don't do this for a living.
[02:40:46.403 --> 02:40:48.364]  It's demoralizing for people who don't get off on it.
[02:40:48.664 --> 02:40:50.986]  But yeah, the Wall Street Journal, they plagiarized Breitbart.
[02:40:51.586 --> 02:40:57.090]  They stole a story that Breitbart had published in November, and then they published it their own yesterday.
[02:40:57.150 --> 02:40:59.711]  They're just really nasty people, these fake news people.
[02:40:59.772 --> 02:41:01.813]  I consider Wall Street Journal fake news, by the way.
[02:41:02.173 --> 02:41:11.375]  And of course, they were the ones who went after PewDiePie when he slightly deviated from making videos about playing video games and, you know, mindless comedy.
[02:41:11.875 --> 02:41:15.996]  Slightly deviated, started talking about trust in mainstream media declining.
[02:41:16.376 --> 02:41:25.798]  That threat, the fact that he's got 55 million subscribers, that led to a full-on onslaught against somebody who was just primarily a video gamer on YouTube.
[02:41:26.078 --> 02:41:27.238]  That's how afraid they are.
[02:41:27.558 --> 02:41:32.260]  Right, and so for those of you who aren't listening in, there's a video game guy.
[02:41:32.300 --> 02:41:34.761]  He has 55 million subscribers on YouTube, maybe 58.
[02:41:34.962 --> 02:41:36.742]  There's so many you can hardly keep track.
[02:41:37.143 --> 02:41:40.744]  He's highly popular and he started to talk about freedom.
[02:41:41.224 --> 02:41:42.725]  He was not even a pro-Trump guy.
[02:41:42.765 --> 02:41:44.006]  He just started talking about freedom.
[02:41:44.346 --> 02:41:46.147]  He started questioning the media narrative.
[02:41:46.447 --> 02:41:48.508]  So what they did was dug up videos
[02:41:49.249 --> 02:41:51.254]  Where he was making fun of Nazis.
[02:41:51.434 --> 02:41:57.689]  He was making fun of Neo-Nazism and you know lifted his hand up in a mock gesture.
[02:41:58.377 --> 02:42:08.901]  And then the Wall Street Journal, which just plagiarized Breitbart because they can't do real journalism, the Wall Street Journal screencapped that and said, PewDiePie is actually a Nazi.
[02:42:09.161 --> 02:42:10.681]  Look at him do the Nazi salute.
[02:42:10.962 --> 02:42:16.263]  They completely omit the fact that he was actually making fun of the neo-Nazi kind of stuff.
[02:42:16.644 --> 02:42:19.124]  And that's, again, what they do is if you do satire, they treat it as real.
[02:42:19.164 --> 02:42:20.665]  But then what they did was even more dirty.
[02:42:21.514 --> 02:42:25.861]  And it shows you how evil these massive globalist corporations are.
[02:42:26.282 --> 02:42:29.648]  So PewDiePie had a massive deal with YouTube.
[02:42:30.168 --> 02:42:32.031]  He had a big show coming out with Disney.
[02:42:32.292 --> 02:42:35.898]  He was making big moves, he was making big money, as were many people on YouTube.
[02:42:36.736 --> 02:42:43.563]  Not only did they falsely accuse him of being a Nazi, they took those pictures to YouTube.
[02:42:43.884 --> 02:42:49.009]  They took them to the advertisers and they said, how can you advertise on a Nazi channel?
[02:42:49.470 --> 02:42:51.052]  How can you advertise on a Nazi channel?
[02:42:51.072 --> 02:42:53.454]  And that's what started the whole demonetization trend, isn't it?
[02:42:53.474 --> 02:42:53.714]  Exactly.
[02:42:53.734 --> 02:42:54.856]  Because it snowballed after that.
[02:42:55.316 --> 02:43:02.764]  What's interesting is that PewDiePie followed Stefan Molyneux, and yours truly, a couple of weeks after that Wall Street Journal hit piece.
[02:43:02.804 --> 02:43:04.345]  Now isn't that interesting, Mike?
[02:43:04.726 --> 02:43:06.347]  That could lead to something, couldn't it?
[02:43:06.448 --> 02:43:08.890]  It is, and then they went after JonTron Show.
[02:43:09.150 --> 02:43:13.615]  Selfishly, as a man of principle, what they did to PewDiePie was wrong.
[02:43:13.735 --> 02:43:14.436]  I disavow it.
[02:43:14.756 --> 02:43:15.457]  That is fake news.
[02:43:15.497 --> 02:43:16.198]  I'm opposed to it.
[02:43:17.225 --> 02:43:26.089]  As a man in a fight to save Western civilization, looking for people to join the fight, looking for people to push back on globalism, I say thank you, Fake News.
[02:43:26.409 --> 02:43:33.052]  Thank you for showing all of PewDiePie's 55 million viewers and subscribers who know what's in his heart.
[02:43:33.432 --> 02:43:41.276]  Thank you for falsely accusing him of being a Nazi, because now they won't trust you, which means they're going to trust Infowars, they're going to trust Paula Great, they're going to trust me.
[02:43:41.876 --> 02:43:44.558]  Please, please spread more fake news on PewDiePie.
[02:43:44.819 --> 02:43:46.420]  Spread more fake news on JonTron.
[02:43:46.660 --> 02:43:49.703]  Spread fake news on all of these people with massive fan bases.
[02:43:50.063 --> 02:43:55.047]  That way their viewers in real time can be red-pilled and learn that you're all fake.
[02:43:55.147 --> 02:43:56.988]  I beg you, more fake news.
[02:43:57.189 --> 02:43:57.769]  Give it to us.
[02:43:58.790 --> 02:44:01.692]  Shifting topics, Mike, let's talk about what happened at the Capitol.
[02:44:01.752 --> 02:44:10.359]  We had the Battle of Berkeley, we'll get onto that in a second, but you were at the Capitol here in Austin for another anti-Trump temper tantrum from the leftists.
[02:44:10.399 --> 02:44:11.080]  Tell us what happened.
[02:44:11.533 --> 02:44:16.837]  Yeah, I don't know if the people have the videos or everything that we could load up, but I went to the anti-Trump rally.
[02:44:16.877 --> 02:44:18.038]  Give us your tax returns!
[02:44:18.118 --> 02:44:22.301]  It was the most low-energy, pathetic... You know, there was like 500 people there.
[02:44:22.422 --> 02:44:26.265]  It's actually still... Yeah, they were talking about us tax returns.
[02:44:26.285 --> 02:44:26.825]  Disaster.
[02:44:27.005 --> 02:44:34.171]  So I go there, and I'm doing just the Periscope streaming, and it's kind of low-energy, and I'm sitting there, and I keep inching towards the microphone.
[02:44:34.811 --> 02:44:38.254]  And as I'm sitting there, I start doing the chants with the people.
[02:44:38.374 --> 02:44:39.495]  They kind of think I'm one of their own.
[02:44:40.615 --> 02:44:46.023]  And then I thought to myself, I said, should I get up on the microphone and say Bill Clinton is a rapist?
[02:44:46.864 --> 02:44:50.108]  And then I go, well, you know, what would they do to me?
[02:44:50.409 --> 02:44:51.931]  If I were holding an event, what would they do to me?
[02:44:52.031 --> 02:44:53.093]  I go, not only would they
[02:44:54.392 --> 02:44:57.335]  Not only would they come and take the microphone, but they would be violent.
[02:44:57.875 --> 02:45:01.078]  So I said, I'm going to wait until this guy gets off the microphone.
[02:45:01.939 --> 02:45:04.902]  And right as he leaves, I'm going to get up there and I'm going to say, Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[02:45:05.602 --> 02:45:06.063]  So I wait.
[02:45:06.643 --> 02:45:07.084]  I'm sitting.
[02:45:07.164 --> 02:45:07.624]  I'm waiting.
[02:45:08.005 --> 02:45:08.926]  I'm waiting for the right moment.
[02:45:08.966 --> 02:45:10.047]  The guy's leading him a chance.
[02:45:11.108 --> 02:45:12.549]  He says, thank you for coming out.
[02:45:13.089 --> 02:45:17.453]  Right as he moves, I stand up, I walk, I go to the stage and I get the microphone and I say,
[02:45:18.618 --> 02:45:19.599]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[02:45:19.859 --> 02:45:21.039]  He raped Juanita Broderick.
[02:45:21.240 --> 02:45:22.120]  The media covered it up.
[02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:23.521]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[02:45:23.721 --> 02:45:25.622]  The crowd goes wild.
[02:45:25.662 --> 02:45:27.543]  Within seconds they were around you, right?
[02:45:27.643 --> 02:45:30.265]  Yeah, the crowd freaks out.
[02:45:30.365 --> 02:45:30.885]  Boo!
[02:45:30.925 --> 02:45:32.106]  They're flipping me off.
[02:45:32.166 --> 02:45:33.487]  The mask came off.
[02:45:34.147 --> 02:45:35.228]  These are not peaceful people.
[02:45:35.248 --> 02:45:37.850]  These are very mentally unhealthy, unstable people.
[02:45:38.770 --> 02:45:40.832]  They came and of course they cut the microphone off.
[02:45:41.092 --> 02:45:42.353]  They rushed the stage.
[02:45:42.393 --> 02:45:43.234]  They were surrounding me.
[02:45:43.274 --> 02:45:43.994]  They were pushing me.
[02:45:44.035 --> 02:45:44.755]  They were shoving me.
[02:45:44.775 --> 02:45:45.576]  They were screaming at me.
[02:45:45.596 --> 02:45:46.857]  They were putting signs in my face.
[02:45:47.637 --> 02:45:51.981]  Actually, I can barely hear out of my right ear today because they were just screaming and shoving me.
[02:45:52.001 --> 02:45:54.003]  You know, it was basically assault but not a big deal.
[02:45:54.043 --> 02:45:58.606]  So I'm walking and the police say, hey man, these people are unstable.
[02:45:58.767 --> 02:46:00.888]  Would you just leave even though you have a right to be here?
[02:46:01.249 --> 02:46:04.111]  Would you just leave because we can't trust these people not to riot?
[02:46:04.131 --> 02:46:04.711]  And I said, of course.
[02:46:05.879 --> 02:46:07.741]  I'm pro-ethical law enforcement.
[02:46:07.821 --> 02:46:08.501]  I'm pro-police.
[02:46:08.541 --> 02:46:09.322]  Blue Lives Matter.
[02:46:10.043 --> 02:46:10.743]  So we're walking.
[02:46:10.924 --> 02:46:11.684]  We're walking down.
[02:46:12.145 --> 02:46:12.525]  It's me.
[02:46:12.885 --> 02:46:13.806]  Two police behind me.
[02:46:14.146 --> 02:46:15.147]  Joe Bix is on my left.
[02:46:15.908 --> 02:46:18.951]  As I'm walking down, I see a guy kind of start sprinting towards me.
[02:46:19.791 --> 02:46:21.013]  So I see him on my peripheral.
[02:46:21.033 --> 02:46:23.435]  I said, is this guy going to try to sucker punch me?
[02:46:23.595 --> 02:46:24.756]  Is this guy going to get violent?
[02:46:24.796 --> 02:46:25.857]  This feral leftist?
[02:46:26.237 --> 02:46:27.078]  Punching at?
[02:46:27.138 --> 02:46:27.859]  Is he going to do it?
[02:46:28.519 --> 02:46:29.100]  Is he going to do it?
[02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:32.123]  Yeah, so here's, you know, on the screen, the people screaming at me.
[02:46:32.624 --> 02:46:35.668]  So, and then after this, I, you know, I'm being walked away by the police.
[02:46:36.209 --> 02:46:37.230]  I see a guy come to my left.
[02:46:37.471 --> 02:46:38.151]  He comes over.
[02:46:38.472 --> 02:46:39.794]  He takes a swipe at me.
[02:46:40.515 --> 02:46:41.896]  Doesn't hit me because I moved my head.
[02:46:42.457 --> 02:46:43.458]  Knocks my phone out.
[02:46:43.819 --> 02:46:45.221]  So I turn around and I go, whoosh!
[02:46:45.701 --> 02:46:48.643]  And you can hear my fist collide with the face.
[02:46:48.703 --> 02:46:51.204]  The guy literally started crying.
[02:46:51.464 --> 02:46:55.667]  That is why there's no video of me punching him in the face because it was self-defense legally.
[02:46:55.727 --> 02:47:00.370]  The police laughed because the guy who thought he was going to be a tough guy thought he was going to hit me.
[02:47:00.910 --> 02:47:04.132]  He actually started crying live.
[02:47:04.252 --> 02:47:04.992]  It was hilarious.
[02:47:05.032 --> 02:47:07.774]  And then I looked at the police and they laughed and they go, we saw what happened.
[02:47:08.234 --> 02:47:08.815]  You're good to go.
[02:47:08.895 --> 02:47:14.541]  So that really does show you that if you are at these events, these people are there.
[02:47:14.601 --> 02:47:15.382]  They are in a cult.
[02:47:15.782 --> 02:47:16.563]  They are in a cult.
[02:47:16.623 --> 02:47:17.344]  They are violent.
[02:47:17.384 --> 02:47:18.465]  They're feral people.
[02:47:19.246 --> 02:47:21.028]  You should not go to an event that you can see.
[02:47:21.048 --> 02:47:26.994]  Look at the anger, the rage, the animosity that they all have towards me, the screaming.
[02:47:27.995 --> 02:47:28.496]  Look at that.
[02:47:28.556 --> 02:47:30.218]  These are not healthy people.
[02:47:30.871 --> 02:47:32.532]  Imagine if Trump people acted like that.
[02:47:32.572 --> 02:47:33.712]  That would be on CNN.
[02:47:33.992 --> 02:47:35.672]  This is what the fake news covers up.
[02:47:36.293 --> 02:47:41.774]  And this is why the fake news wants to shut down InfoWars, wants to shut us all down.
[02:47:42.094 --> 02:47:44.955]  Because that there, you'll never see that on CNN.
[02:47:45.035 --> 02:47:46.435]  You'll never watch that on the fake news.
[02:47:46.595 --> 02:47:47.676]  That is the left today.
[02:47:48.056 --> 02:47:50.076]  Nothing but anger and toxicity.
[02:47:50.096 --> 02:47:50.637]  They can't debate.
[02:47:50.657 --> 02:47:51.737]  They don't have an argument.
[02:47:51.997 --> 02:47:56.141]  That's why they're trying to shut us down, because they can't compete on a level playing field.
[02:47:56.281 --> 02:48:00.004]  It's just autistic screeching, it's violence, it's confrontation.
[02:48:00.304 --> 02:48:01.826]  They've got absolutely nothing.
[02:48:02.386 --> 02:48:06.210]  You know, that coincided, Mike, with what happened at Berkeley, the Battle of Berkeley.
[02:48:06.850 --> 02:48:08.252]  I think it was quite decisive.
[02:48:08.312 --> 02:48:09.513]  Who won the battle this time?
[02:48:09.573 --> 02:48:10.514]  Break it down, what happened?
[02:48:10.874 --> 02:48:14.857]  Okay, so as we know, if you want to attend an event,
[02:48:15.578 --> 02:48:25.354]  With Paul the Great, Milo, Alex Jones, Stefan Molyneux, anybody who, you know, Jim Hoft, Gateway Pundit, anybody who is just off-narrative.
[02:48:26.195 --> 02:48:27.317]  The left will show up.
[02:48:27.810 --> 02:48:28.010]  I don't
[02:48:50.177 --> 02:48:52.079]  Which is a domestic terrorist organization.
[02:48:52.460 --> 02:48:58.286]  Let Antifa, the domestic terrorist organization, beat these people up, including women.
[02:48:59.087 --> 02:49:00.889]  So they wanted to have a free speech rally.
[02:49:01.270 --> 02:49:07.797]  The people realized if you want to have a free speech rally, you're going to have to bring your own protection detail, your own security detail.
[02:49:08.538 --> 02:49:09.800]  So in the streets of Berkeley,
[02:49:10.586 --> 02:49:15.693]  And Tifa got to decide, got to see for themselves, who can do it better.
[02:49:15.713 --> 02:49:16.994]  Do you want to meet in the streets?
[02:49:17.415 --> 02:49:20.258]  Paul the Great, he's a pacifist more so than I am.
[02:49:20.579 --> 02:49:25.785]  I'm a, I'm a, I want to fight but, you know, I just got to make sure you hit me first kind of thing.
[02:49:26.446 --> 02:49:28.448]  Paul the Great is just total pacifist, right?
[02:49:28.488 --> 02:49:35.993]  We disavow, but they set the rule where it's okay to punch somebody because you disagree with them politically while you read what you saw.
[02:49:36.053 --> 02:49:45.880]  If you go back to the article you had up on screen from Heat Street before with a woman being punched, she put out on Facebook, the woman on the left, she was going to punch a Nazi.
[02:49:46.500 --> 02:49:47.921]  She assaulted this guy.
[02:49:47.941 --> 02:49:48.882]  She was choking him, yeah.
[02:49:48.922 --> 02:49:53.126]  We disavow any violence, but if you watch the actual video, she attacked him first.
[02:49:53.406 --> 02:49:54.267]  This is what happened to her.
[02:49:54.607 --> 02:49:57.529]  Now, she's whining about being injured.
[02:49:57.589 --> 02:50:00.011]  She's whining about being doxxed on the internet.
[02:50:00.352 --> 02:50:01.913]  This is a member of Antifa.
[02:50:02.173 --> 02:50:03.975]  Their speciality is doxxing people.
[02:50:04.235 --> 02:50:05.456]  They tried to get my address.
[02:50:05.756 --> 02:50:08.378]  They turned up at my friend's address a mile down the road.
[02:50:08.839 --> 02:50:10.400]  So, you reap what you sow, Mike.
[02:50:10.540 --> 02:50:13.221]  Now they're all out there whining about being attacked and doxxed.
[02:50:13.261 --> 02:50:14.762]  Well, they brought it on themselves.
[02:50:14.822 --> 02:50:15.942]  And they got steamrolled.
[02:50:16.082 --> 02:50:18.943]  So here's what they did, and they miscalculated, right?
[02:50:19.543 --> 02:50:22.124]  This is not the National Review.
[02:50:22.564 --> 02:50:29.447]  This is not these weak people like William F. Buckley, who says, oh, if they spit on your face, just let them spit on your face.
[02:50:29.607 --> 02:50:30.247]  Let them hit you.
[02:50:30.767 --> 02:50:36.589]  Antifa, a domestic terrorist organization, which is also a tool of the media, the media incites them to violence.
[02:50:36.909 --> 02:50:37.910]  They want to find out.
[02:50:38.610 --> 02:50:39.331]  What's going to happen?
[02:50:39.451 --> 02:50:42.092]  I disavow political violence, but I can tell you one thing.
[02:50:43.453 --> 02:50:46.575]  If it gets hot, I know what side is going to win.
[02:50:47.636 --> 02:50:48.497]  And there are more videos.
[02:50:48.797 --> 02:50:50.598]  Antifa was later chased off.
[02:50:50.658 --> 02:50:53.480]  It was a decisive, clear victory.
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:51:00.024]  We'll be back with the final segment of this hour on the Alex Jones Show Live with Mike Cernovich in 4Wars.com.
[02:51:00.044 --> 02:51:00.585]  Stay right there.
[02:51:03.912 --> 02:51:06.054]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[02:51:06.474 --> 02:51:18.480]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[02:51:18.500 --> 02:51:23.623]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies.
[02:51:23.643 --> 02:51:24.804]  You can look them up for yourself.
[02:51:25.484 --> 02:51:35.188]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[02:51:35.328 --> 02:51:41.471]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[02:51:42.351 --> 02:51:44.212]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[02:51:45.213 --> 02:51:46.433]  People are falling apart.
[02:51:46.493 --> 02:51:47.474]  They're totally depressed.
[02:51:47.494 --> 02:51:48.034]  They're unhappy.
[02:51:48.614 --> 02:51:49.595]  What is going on?
[02:51:50.875 --> 02:51:54.717]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[02:51:55.953 --> 02:51:58.535]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[02:51:58.915 --> 02:52:00.636]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:52:00.816 --> 02:52:07.841]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:52:08.061 --> 02:52:16.387]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[02:52:17.794 --> 02:52:24.302]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[02:52:24.683 --> 02:52:28.107]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:52:28.147 --> 02:52:31.271]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[02:52:31.871 --> 02:52:36.957]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:52:37.478 --> 02:52:40.620]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:52:40.920 --> 02:52:51.347]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[02:52:51.467 --> 02:52:52.908]  The bone is so amazing.
[02:52:53.328 --> 02:52:58.932]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[02:53:00.049 --> 02:53:02.971]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[02:53:03.511 --> 02:53:08.934]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[02:53:09.214 --> 02:53:18.700]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[02:53:18.980 --> 02:53:23.523]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[02:53:23.763 --> 02:53:25.544]  This is a absolute win-win.
[02:53:25.624 --> 02:53:28.384]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[02:53:28.665 --> 02:53:34.786]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[02:53:36.087 --> 02:53:44.850]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:53:44.970 --> 02:53:49.371]  Three years in the making, incredible research, and the very best ingredients.
[02:53:49.891 --> 02:53:52.492]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[02:53:53.220 --> 02:53:56.483]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[02:53:56.904 --> 02:54:00.328]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[02:54:21.411 --> 02:54:22.892]  We are back with Mike Cernovich.
[02:54:23.072 --> 02:54:26.393]  It's the Alex Jones Show live with me, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:54:26.453 --> 02:54:36.518]  First, I want to tell you again about the specials because your support has been so crucial, especially over the past couple of weeks with these sustained attacks that continue day by day.
[02:54:36.898 --> 02:54:47.183]  But we've managed to survive and thrive despite the ad roll, despite the Google attacks, despite the YouTube demonetization, purely through your support.
[02:54:47.243 --> 02:54:48.344]  We don't get cut.
[02:54:48.704 --> 02:54:50.764]  Fat Chex by George Soros.
[02:54:51.105 --> 02:54:53.405]  We don't sell pharmaceutical advertising.
[02:54:53.625 --> 02:54:57.366]  We don't take money from Gulf State dictatorships like CNN.
[02:54:57.786 --> 02:55:01.647]  But then, we're bad, we're discredited because we sell nutritional products.
[02:55:01.987 --> 02:55:02.787]  God forbid!
[02:55:03.547 --> 02:55:07.108]  You don't believe that because you've been getting them at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:55:07.128 --> 02:55:09.588]  Again, 30% off Brain Force, 25% off Supermail Vitality.
[02:55:12.677 --> 02:55:15.078]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, 25% off.
[02:55:15.338 --> 02:55:22.341]  Vitamin B12, massive discounts extended for a short time only at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:55:22.361 --> 02:55:23.942]  It is the Easter special.
[02:55:23.982 --> 02:55:27.084]  We also have Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[02:55:27.104 --> 02:55:28.564]  Again, read the reviews.
[02:55:28.984 --> 02:55:33.767]  Independent, third-party, five-star verified reviews.
[02:55:34.047 --> 02:55:35.908]  We had the toothpaste, as Mike said earlier.
[02:55:36.168 --> 02:55:38.629]  Look, you're going to get fluoride-free toothpaste anyway.
[02:55:39.229 --> 02:55:40.469]  That's just a staple now.
[02:55:40.810 --> 02:55:41.970]  Why not get it from us?
[02:55:42.610 --> 02:55:48.333]  Support the growth of this network, the survival of this network, as we're constantly sniped and attacked.
[02:55:49.213 --> 02:55:55.855]  We are fighting back and you're helping us do it by getting the products at InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:55:56.716 --> 02:56:00.477]  Mike, you've had a lot of attention from the mainstream media over the past three weeks.
[02:56:00.497 --> 02:56:04.559]  You had the 60-minute special, you've broken huge story after huge story.
[02:56:05.580 --> 02:56:08.630]  What led up to that process and what's next for Mike Cernovich?
[02:56:09.914 --> 02:56:10.636]  Man, I don't know.
[02:56:11.038 --> 02:56:11.339]  They're...
[02:56:12.588 --> 02:56:13.709]  They're trying to take me down.
[02:56:13.889 --> 02:56:15.330]  You know, every day they're trying to take me down.
[02:56:15.970 --> 02:56:21.574]  More lies, more hit pieces, and all that I'm seeing is that we are growing and the truth is getting out there.
[02:56:21.755 --> 02:56:25.697]  So I don't even know what is going on anymore because so many people are waking up.
[02:56:26.278 --> 02:56:29.180]  Every time we're out in public, you know, people know us.
[02:56:29.300 --> 02:56:30.120]  People talk to us.
[02:56:30.501 --> 02:56:31.602]  The Freedom Fighters are out there.
[02:56:31.642 --> 02:56:32.462]  So what is next?
[02:56:32.582 --> 02:56:34.464]  More community and more meetups.
[02:56:34.504 --> 02:56:37.266]  I'm having a big event with Gateway Pundit.
[02:56:37.286 --> 02:56:38.546]  They're going to be there this April 29th.
[02:56:38.687 --> 02:56:40.428]  I'll announce exact details later.
[02:56:41.292 --> 02:56:42.232]  So I'll be in D.C.
[02:56:42.292 --> 02:56:45.194]  April 29th, and I want a big march on Google.
[02:56:45.654 --> 02:56:48.175]  I want everybody there to show up.
[02:56:48.695 --> 02:56:49.976]  People need community.
[02:56:50.256 --> 02:56:55.498]  Everybody right now feels isolated because of the fake news media lying to you all the time, but we're out there.
[02:56:55.898 --> 02:56:58.139]  We need to form our own real-life social network.
[02:56:58.459 --> 02:57:03.401]  We need to be having monthly meetups, monthly happy hours in cities all across the world.
[02:57:04.441 --> 02:57:06.602]  Then we're going to, we're taking control.
[02:57:06.622 --> 02:57:07.643]  We're taking our country back.
[02:57:07.803 --> 02:57:08.483]  That's what's next.
[02:57:09.912 --> 02:57:15.856]  And again, that is crucial to have those meetups, because it's not something that we've done generally as Conservatives, is it?
[02:57:15.876 --> 02:57:17.117]  That's not what we're known for.
[02:57:17.478 --> 02:57:20.380]  There is this accusation that people are hiding behind Twitter accounts.
[02:57:20.460 --> 02:57:29.306]  It is key, it is crucial to get out there physically, meet people of like mind, because you know the left is going to do that, you know they're going to march and say, whose streets?
[02:57:29.526 --> 02:57:30.067]  Our streets.
[02:57:30.487 --> 02:57:32.428]  Well now that's beginning to be rolled back.
[02:57:32.488 --> 02:57:34.110]  We saw what happened in Berkeley.
[02:57:34.510 --> 02:57:37.012]  We've clearly got the numbers, they haven't.
[02:57:37.532 --> 02:57:38.273]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:57:38.373 --> 02:57:40.495]  So I actually tweeted out, whose streets?
[02:57:40.956 --> 02:57:43.939]  Because I'd cover all the protests and that's what the protesters on the left would say.
[02:57:43.979 --> 02:57:44.459]  Whose streets?
[02:57:44.559 --> 02:57:45.020]  Our streets.
[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:47.822]  So I tweeted out after the Battle of Berkeley, whose streets?
[02:57:48.523 --> 02:57:50.005]  And the left was completely triggered.
[02:57:50.025 --> 02:57:50.946]  This is disgusting.
[02:57:51.006 --> 02:57:51.546]  I can't believe it.
[02:57:51.586 --> 02:57:55.831]  Wait, because we've appropriated your memes and we've appropriated what you're doing.
[02:57:56.892 --> 02:58:03.634]  What a lot of people don't realize is things that we do wrong on the right, we don't do activism well, and we don't coordinate.
[02:58:04.174 --> 02:58:07.835]  So Paul LeGray will tell you, we don't talk about what we're going to tweet about.
[02:58:07.875 --> 02:58:09.135]  We don't have a meeting.
[02:58:09.915 --> 02:58:11.416]  There is no right-wing conspiracy.
[02:58:11.776 --> 02:58:16.317]  And in a way that works to our detriment because a lot of times we're off message.
[02:58:16.917 --> 02:58:23.218]  So we need more community, more connection, more activism, more happy hours, more meetups, call them what you want.
[02:58:23.238 --> 02:58:24.219]  We're going to march on Google.
[02:58:24.419 --> 02:58:25.139]  That's what we're going to do.
[02:58:26.291 --> 02:58:30.595]  We're going to come back in the final segment, final few minutes with Mike Cernovich.
[02:58:30.615 --> 02:58:31.816]  We'll tell you how you can help.
[02:58:32.337 --> 02:58:34.479]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[02:58:35.159 --> 02:58:36.140]  Next segment coming up.
[02:58:36.260 --> 02:58:37.101]  Stay right there.
[02:58:43.427 --> 02:58:46.670]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.710 --> 02:58:48.892]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:53.564 --> 02:58:54.645]  Want to stop progress?
[02:58:54.905 --> 02:58:56.707]  Contact your local Progressive Democrat.
[02:58:56.907 --> 02:59:02.453]  With Airbnb rising in popularity, the hotel industry is freaking out and Progressive Democrats are responding.
[02:59:02.713 --> 02:59:08.279]  First, the Federal Trade Commission requested an investigation be done into how Airbnb was affecting the housing market.
[02:59:08.459 --> 02:59:16.006]  Why waste our money on that, I'm not sure, but Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo signed a bill making it a finable offense to post on Airbnb.
[02:59:16.227 --> 02:59:20.070]  Another example of the government getting involved in private business where it doesn't belong.
[02:59:20.311 --> 02:59:26.677]  If you violate a lease, that is between you and your leaseholder, but now the government has a preemptive strike against the Airbnb host.
[02:59:26.917 --> 02:59:31.321]  You can be sure this is a result of the hotel industry lobbying our fine politicians.
[02:59:31.701 --> 02:59:44.071]  Linda Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the bill, said, Which doesn't even make sense because innovation and competition always lowers costs.
[02:59:44.271 --> 02:59:46.253]  But these are Democrats we're talking about here.
[02:59:46.433 --> 02:59:48.455]  So don't bother trying to progress an industry.
[02:59:48.655 --> 02:59:50.777]  Progressive Democrats are waiting to stop you.
[02:59:50.937 --> 02:59:53.039]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:59:54.628 --> 02:59:58.729]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.249 --> 03:00:00.589]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.871 --> 03:00:10.091]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[03:00:10.131 --> 03:00:15.912]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:16.472 --> 03:00:20.173]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:00:27.727 --> 03:00:30.769]  We are back, and we are into the fourth hour.
[03:00:30.849 --> 03:00:37.993]  David Knight is coming up in a few minutes with huge, fresh, breaking news, but we've got the final few minutes here with Mike Cernovich.
[03:00:38.774 --> 03:00:41.816]  Mike, they were completely shocked that Hillary lost the election.
[03:00:41.836 --> 03:00:43.016]  They never saw it coming.
[03:00:43.597 --> 03:00:48.060]  Their own hubris tripped them up, you know, 99% chance of Hillary winning.
[03:00:48.920 --> 03:00:49.481]  She lost.
[03:00:49.701 --> 03:00:50.502]  They were shocked.
[03:00:50.562 --> 03:00:51.743]  They were shell-shocked.
[03:00:51.943 --> 03:00:54.025]  Now we're getting the backlash.
[03:00:54.065 --> 03:00:59.029]  We've often had this debate of, you know, if Hillary had have won, Infowars would have been shut down.
[03:00:59.049 --> 03:01:00.050]  They would have come after us.
[03:01:00.871 --> 03:01:03.893]  I kind of think it's happening anyway.
[03:01:04.053 --> 03:01:05.355]  Maybe it's even worse now.
[03:01:05.415 --> 03:01:06.736]  Maybe if Hillary had have won,
[03:01:07.116 --> 03:01:08.557]  They'd have got the political power.
[03:01:08.798 --> 03:01:09.999]  They might have backed off.
[03:01:10.059 --> 03:01:14.343]  They might have treated us less importantly because they thought we had less power.
[03:01:14.663 --> 03:01:21.049]  Do you think the fact that she lost and they were so shocked by it has made that backlash even more intense in a way?
[03:01:21.509 --> 03:01:22.590]  They're vindictive people.
[03:01:22.690 --> 03:01:24.352]  I don't think they would have ever backed off.
[03:01:24.452 --> 03:01:25.332]  That hasn't been true.
[03:01:26.013 --> 03:01:29.194]  But that's one way to look at it, is maybe they would have.
[03:01:29.734 --> 03:01:36.075]  They are looking for scapegoats, and I think it's funny because this is how dumb these people are on Twitter.
[03:01:36.575 --> 03:01:44.117]  Glenn Greenwald, who is a progressive Bernie Sanders supporter, said, why hasn't there been a post-mortem for the DNC?
[03:01:44.157 --> 03:01:48.938]  Why haven't they realized that running a globalist candidate with Parkinson's disease was a bad idea?
[03:01:49.398 --> 03:01:53.980]  And I retweeted it, and now they're trying to say, oh wow, you know, Glinker and Wall got retweeted by Mike Cicerno.
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:54.860]  That becomes a story.
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:01:57.101]  That's how basic and just dumb they are.
[03:01:57.921 --> 03:01:58.661]  They don't get it.
[03:01:58.722 --> 03:01:59.722]  Hillary Clinton sucks.
[03:02:00.042 --> 03:02:01.583]  The message of the left is bad.
[03:02:01.683 --> 03:02:03.083]  There's terrorism everywhere.
[03:02:03.523 --> 03:02:04.404]  There are rape mobs.
[03:02:04.784 --> 03:02:05.744]  You can't go in Sweden.
[03:02:06.424 --> 03:02:08.185]  You can't even have a festival hardly.
[03:02:08.405 --> 03:02:11.266]  They almost cancelled the beer festival in Munich.
[03:02:11.766 --> 03:02:12.387]  Oktoberfest.
[03:02:12.667 --> 03:02:13.847]  There's rape everywhere.
[03:02:14.267 --> 03:02:15.488]  Rape is everywhere in
[03:02:16.707 --> 03:02:17.007]  Europe.
[03:02:17.487 --> 03:02:18.808]  People watched it in real time.
[03:02:19.188 --> 03:02:23.630]  Remember how the fake news media refused to cover the Cologne sexual attacks?
[03:02:23.670 --> 03:02:24.991]  Yeah, they covered it up for days.
[03:02:25.251 --> 03:02:28.033]  So people now realize there's rape everywhere in Europe.
[03:02:28.573 --> 03:02:30.874]  There are rape mobs roving where it's not even safe.
[03:02:31.534 --> 03:02:32.335]  They don't want that.
[03:02:32.395 --> 03:02:33.375]  The people don't want that.
[03:02:33.455 --> 03:02:34.035]  I have a daughter.
[03:02:34.055 --> 03:02:34.496]  I have a wife.
[03:02:35.416 --> 03:02:38.618]  Don't want the government importing massive rape mobs.
[03:02:38.918 --> 03:02:40.980]  They're living it, day to day.
[03:02:41.140 --> 03:02:50.806]  So they know that when the mainstream lies and say it's all creation of the hateful right wing, they know it's not true because they live in these areas where these migrants are being brought in.
[03:02:51.087 --> 03:02:53.588]  And they are being brought in, that's the point I made.
[03:02:53.868 --> 03:02:59.172]  The boats go out 11 miles off the coast of Libya and bring them in like a taxi service.
[03:02:59.532 --> 03:03:04.896]  The EU, these NGO groups doing this, they're using these migrants as a weapon against the West.
[03:03:05.556 --> 03:03:07.018]  And they want to blame you.
[03:03:07.038 --> 03:03:08.439]  They want to blame InfoWars.
[03:03:08.499 --> 03:03:09.760]  They want to attack all of us.
[03:03:10.160 --> 03:03:12.983]  Rather than just say, wow, maybe our ideas suck.
[03:03:13.243 --> 03:03:14.304]  Maybe our ideas are bad.
[03:03:14.584 --> 03:03:15.485]  Maybe they're terrible.
[03:03:15.525 --> 03:03:16.506]  They want to go after us.
[03:03:16.926 --> 03:03:19.809]  But I know that as this segment ends, I'm going to have some bone broth.
[03:03:20.329 --> 03:03:26.275]  So I definitely got to try the bone broth stuff that Alex Jones has, the new product, because I'm really into that stuff.
[03:03:26.315 --> 03:03:27.236]  It's good for the collagen.
[03:03:27.416 --> 03:03:28.537]  Collagen growth I've been taking.
[03:03:29.301 --> 03:03:33.963]  I think you've definitely earned it, and the skin care tips were really appreciated as well.
[03:03:34.063 --> 03:03:37.584]  I think Infomercials needs a skin care line, you know, but that's a different subject.
[03:03:37.604 --> 03:03:51.249]  But yeah, I'm definitely, I haven't tried the Caveman True Paleo formula, so I can't like, I only endorse things that I use and I believe in, so I haven't tried it yet, but if I like, and by the way guys, he'll tell you, I'm honest, I'm not getting paid for this, they're doing me a favor by having me on.
[03:03:52.169 --> 03:03:55.173]  Nobody's paying me to plug anything, but I practice what I preach.
[03:03:55.714 --> 03:04:00.480]  They're doing great things, they're breaking news, and I'm going to support it in any way that I possibly can.
[03:04:00.981 --> 03:04:03.905]  And there's no way you're going to shame us out of selling products.
[03:04:04.446 --> 03:04:08.731]  God forbid we're selling products that people give five-star reviews for.
[03:04:09.292 --> 03:04:11.174]  We're not taking fat checks from George Soros.
[03:04:11.194 --> 03:04:22.948]  We're not funded literally like CNN by Gulf State dictatorships who pay them to produce puff pieces about how great Bahrain is as they're literally mowing down protesters on the street.
[03:04:24.189 --> 03:04:29.395]  You'll never find any critical news coverage of Saudi Arabia, even though women are impressed in Saudi Arabia.
[03:04:29.716 --> 03:04:33.600]  The Saudis gave money to the Clinton Foundation to buy children from Haiti.
[03:04:33.640 --> 03:04:35.102]  They're bombing the Yemenis and Christians.
[03:04:35.502 --> 03:04:37.164]  They're killing Christians everywhere.
[03:04:37.485 --> 03:04:41.109]  You'll never see that in the fake news because Saudi Arabia owns American media.
[03:04:41.430 --> 03:04:42.090]  You the people!
[03:04:44.312 --> 03:04:47.054]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[03:04:47.114 --> 03:04:48.295]  David Knight is coming up.
[03:04:48.335 --> 03:04:52.918]  You can check out Cernovich at Cernovich on Twitter or medium.com slash at Cernovich.
[03:04:53.358 --> 03:04:54.739]  David Knight coming up.
[03:04:54.939 --> 03:04:55.599]  Fourth hour.
[03:04:55.900 --> 03:04:57.301]  Fresh breaking news.
[03:04:57.541 --> 03:04:59.142]  Infowars.com.
[03:05:03.208 --> 03:05:04.289]  You have no money?
[03:05:04.549 --> 03:05:06.510]  This is okay, we will take your blood.
[03:05:06.790 --> 03:05:12.134]  If you want access to the Vatican Museums, cash, visa, MasterCard, or needle is accepted.
[03:05:12.454 --> 03:05:15.796]  That's right, you can give blood to access the Vatican Museums.
[03:05:16.036 --> 03:05:20.559]  The blood payment plan has a slogan, give blood and follow your artistic inclination.
[03:05:20.819 --> 03:05:24.081]  Blood donors then receive a voucher which gives them access to the museums.
[03:05:24.462 --> 03:05:28.084]  The director of the Vatican Museums said, without blood there is no life.
[03:05:28.564 --> 03:05:31.005]  Without art, life would be empty and sad.
[03:05:31.705 --> 03:05:33.405]  Okay, I love Jesus, too.
[03:05:33.485 --> 03:05:34.186]  Happy Easter!
[03:05:34.886 --> 03:05:36.106]  I guess this is a good idea.
[03:05:36.526 --> 03:05:39.187]  Get some blood donations and allow people access to history.
[03:05:39.467 --> 03:05:40.787]  Sounds harmless, but wait.
[03:05:41.208 --> 03:05:43.768]  Each blood donation is good for a four-euro voucher.
[03:05:44.168 --> 03:05:46.549]  It costs sixteen euros to access the museums.
[03:05:47.249 --> 03:05:50.410]  So you have to donate blood four times before you can even get in.
[03:05:50.990 --> 03:05:53.551]  By the time you've given enough blood, you'd have fainted.
[03:05:54.372 --> 03:05:58.419]  Enjoy Michelangelo's Last Judgment as you recover from hypovolemia.
[03:05:58.960 --> 03:06:01.185]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[03:06:03.058 --> 03:06:06.620]  I'm going to commit blasphemy against the globalists right now in the New World Order.
[03:06:07.521 --> 03:06:20.230]  I'm going to tell all of you that we're celebrating the Christian holiday of Easter, Our Risen Christ, on the third day by having some of the biggest specials ever at Infowarsstore.com on amazing supplements.
[03:06:20.690 --> 03:06:30.156]  You know, mainstream media demonizes us for selling high-quality organic supplements that are game changers, while they have all the poison big pharma drug ads all day sitting there poisoning the people.
[03:06:30.456 --> 03:06:32.858]  What a shameful group of wicked devils.
[03:06:33.518 --> 03:06:37.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, our Christ raised from the dead on the third day.
[03:06:38.861 --> 03:06:45.664]  And our Republic can rise from the dead if we wake up to what the globalists are doing and if you support independent free media.
[03:06:46.104 --> 03:06:50.446]  There's never been a better time to support InfoWars with these specials at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:06:50.866 --> 03:06:52.186]  Because it's all about life.
[03:06:52.807 --> 03:07:00.370]  Get the products, whether it's water filtration, nutraceuticals, Patriot apparel, you name it, it's all available at InfoWarsStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:07:03.438 --> 03:07:04.840]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:07:04.880 --> 03:07:05.961]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:07:06.221 --> 03:07:07.142]  Why is this so good?
[03:07:07.422 --> 03:07:12.666]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:07:12.746 --> 03:07:26.317]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:07:26.377 --> 03:07:27.759]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:07:28.499 --> 03:07:30.081]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:07:30.161 --> 03:07:32.664]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:07:32.744 --> 03:07:34.006]  These are all parasites.
[03:07:34.066 --> 03:07:35.167]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:07:35.187 --> 03:07:36.208]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:07:36.529 --> 03:07:40.854]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:07:41.054 --> 03:07:44.238]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:07:44.278 --> 03:07:47.381]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:07:47.401 --> 03:07:48.422]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:07:48.462 --> 03:07:50.364]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:50.404 --> 03:07:51.444]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:07:51.725 --> 03:07:53.526]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:07:54.147 --> 03:07:57.210]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:57.450 --> 03:07:59.332]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:07:59.712 --> 03:08:01.674]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:08:08.021 --> 03:08:14.611]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:15.111 --> 03:08:17.715]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[03:08:20.820 --> 03:08:22.883]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:24.676 --> 03:08:34.383]  I'm David Knight and we're going to take a look at some of the breaking news here with Google going to war with the First Amendment, especially going to war with InfoWars First.
[03:08:35.124 --> 03:08:45.351]  But I think where I want to start today is something that kind of hit close to home because it's an area where my wife grew up on Long Island and now this area
[03:08:46.440 --> 03:08:49.766]  Is having rampant MS-13 gang violence.
[03:08:49.786 --> 03:08:51.449]  This is a story that broke on Friday.
[03:08:51.529 --> 03:08:53.372]  Four bodies found on Long Island.
[03:08:53.712 --> 03:08:55.976]  They appear to be linked to gang violence.
[03:08:55.996 --> 03:08:57.719]  They say a phone call came on a Wednesday night.
[03:08:58.700 --> 03:09:01.621]  This is somebody who got a call and said, I see your brother.
[03:09:02.201 --> 03:09:03.161]  He was getting killed.
[03:09:03.721 --> 03:09:08.282]  They say four bodies of young people have been brutally killed near a park in Suffolk County.
[03:09:08.882 --> 03:09:11.863]  And one of these guys, all these people actually are Hispanic.
[03:09:12.643 --> 03:09:15.483]  So this is not a situation of racism.
[03:09:15.523 --> 03:09:19.264]  These are people who want to live peacefully and quietly.
[03:09:19.304 --> 03:09:20.864]  Maybe that's why they fled that area.
[03:09:20.884 --> 03:09:23.265]  But because we don't have any control over the border,
[03:09:24.005 --> 03:09:28.867]  Anyone who wants to come here and live here peacefully is going to be joined by the same people that they fled.
[03:09:28.887 --> 03:09:31.109]  And they're going to be living in our communities as well.
[03:09:31.129 --> 03:09:32.729]  And this is already happening in Suffolk County.
[03:09:32.749 --> 03:09:40.873]  The Suffolk County Police Commissioner said at a news conference that the four had been killed in a manner that was consistent with the MO of MS-13.
[03:09:41.774 --> 03:09:46.436]  And of course MS-13 began, had its roots in illegal immigration.
[03:09:46.996 --> 03:09:49.858]  A massive number of people who illegally immigrated into LA
[03:09:51.027 --> 03:09:58.472]  Then connected, they said, for their own protection, connected with gangs back in Central America and El Salvador.
[03:09:59.352 --> 03:10:03.815]  And now they were responsible just last year for 11 deaths that they found.
[03:10:04.415 --> 03:10:08.177]  They point out, they said, there's no question that we still have MS-13 in Suffolk County.
[03:10:08.438 --> 03:10:10.159]  And that was in spite of what happened in September.
[03:10:10.199 --> 03:10:13.100]  In September, they found the bodies of a 16-year-old and a 15-year-old.
[03:10:14.902 --> 03:10:16.843]  This is in Brentwood, a neighboring town.
[03:10:16.863 --> 03:10:18.965]  This is all over Long Island.
[03:10:19.026 --> 03:10:22.749]  Any of you who don't know the area, Long Island is kind of a suburb of New York City.
[03:10:23.310 --> 03:10:28.995]  All these small communities have grown together into a megalopolis that's there.
[03:10:29.055 --> 03:10:34.080]  So all these small communities now are afflicted with MS-13 because it's organized crime.
[03:10:34.460 --> 03:10:38.764]  Because the root of all of this, what is the root of our immigration problem,
[03:10:39.545 --> 03:10:40.006]  I think so.
[03:10:59.582 --> 03:11:04.064]  What you do is you give a market, a black market monopoly to the people who want to run it.
[03:11:04.124 --> 03:11:04.904]  We've seen it all before.
[03:11:04.944 --> 03:11:06.045]  We saw it in alcohol prohibition.
[03:11:06.085 --> 03:11:07.345]  We saw it with Al Capone and others.
[03:11:07.926 --> 03:11:09.666]  Why can't we learn the lesson?
[03:11:09.926 --> 03:11:13.508]  We've done this now for 46 years.
[03:11:13.808 --> 03:11:18.850]  We're going on our 46th year of the war on drugs that was declared by Richard Nixon.
[03:11:19.030 --> 03:11:20.271]  It's unconstitutional, by the way.
[03:11:20.931 --> 03:11:29.238]  At least when they had the failed alcohol prohibition, they created an amendment to do it because they understood that they didn't have the power to do this under the Commerce Clause.
[03:11:29.678 --> 03:11:33.321]  That's the fiction under which they operate the illegal war on drugs.
[03:11:33.842 --> 03:11:36.384]  But you need to also understand that it's got a UN component.
[03:11:36.444 --> 03:11:37.445]  It's another UN agenda.
[03:11:38.257 --> 03:11:45.843]  This was, the War on Drugs was an agenda with all the four schedules, with all the drugs put into all those four schedules.
[03:11:45.863 --> 03:11:47.024]  That was created by the UN.
[03:11:47.544 --> 03:11:50.346]  It was created exactly ten years before Richard Nixon did it.
[03:11:50.546 --> 03:11:52.828]  Of course, everybody thought that he invented that.
[03:11:52.888 --> 03:11:54.389]  No, it was created by the UN.
[03:11:55.010 --> 03:11:57.612]  And then the United States just enacted it verbatim.
[03:11:58.584 --> 03:12:01.130]  So they talk about the murders back in September.
[03:12:01.150 --> 03:12:03.735]  It was something that got everybody's attention because they were so brutal.
[03:12:03.775 --> 03:12:08.065]  The teenagers had been beaten to death with baseball bats and machetes.
[03:12:09.278 --> 03:12:11.440]  Beaten to death with baseball bats and machetes.
[03:12:11.480 --> 03:12:14.162]  The same violence we see throughout Mexico.
[03:12:14.603 --> 03:12:18.726]  Which, by the way, more people have died there than have died in Afghanistan and the wars there.
[03:12:18.746 --> 03:12:20.227]  That is coming to our shore.
[03:12:20.908 --> 03:12:27.273]  See, the open borders bring in the drug war, bring in the Islamic war of terror.
[03:12:27.293 --> 03:12:28.715]  It brings all that into us.
[03:12:29.515 --> 03:12:30.816]  It imports all that chaos.
[03:12:30.877 --> 03:12:32.078]  It imports all that terrorism.
[03:12:32.138 --> 03:12:34.219]  It imports all that crime into us.
[03:12:35.080 --> 03:12:40.202]  A wall is something that would maybe help, but it is not the solution.
[03:12:40.222 --> 03:12:41.843]  You have to go to the root cause of it.
[03:12:42.103 --> 03:12:50.587]  It's not going to do any good to have a wall when you still give people the kind of welfare benefits that to them are just irresistible.
[03:12:51.227 --> 03:12:58.590]  You put a big magnet there, and no matter how tiny you try to make the holes, the people will squeeze through to come to this country.
[03:12:58.670 --> 03:13:00.871]  And so will the criminals, because it's so lucrative.
[03:13:01.551 --> 03:13:03.533]  And so will the dedicated terrorists.
[03:13:03.573 --> 03:13:04.994]  They will find a way to get in as well.
[03:13:05.334 --> 03:13:12.821]  We have to stop the wars that we do in terms of regime change that creates terrorism, chaos and war in those areas.
[03:13:12.901 --> 03:13:15.983]  Why don't the liberals push back against the war?
[03:13:16.184 --> 03:13:17.825]  Why don't they push back against the root cause?
[03:13:18.485 --> 03:13:23.350]  Why don't they push back against the war on drugs that is killing so many people in Mexico and Central America?
[03:13:23.370 --> 03:13:24.431]  Why don't they push back on that?
[03:13:25.331 --> 03:13:25.812]  We know why.
[03:13:25.832 --> 03:13:29.415]  They talk about the fact that when this happened in September, these two individuals
[03:13:30.424 --> 03:13:34.187]  They've been beaten with machetes and baseball bats, brutally murdered.
[03:13:34.747 --> 03:13:42.653]  They started investigating, and then they found the skeletal remains of three teenage boys, and eventually they arrested more than 125 gang members.
[03:13:43.133 --> 03:13:50.779]  In March, federal authorities charged 13 adult members of MS-13 with a variety of crimes, including racketeering and murder.
[03:13:50.859 --> 03:13:53.541]  Ten were undocumented immigrants, prosecutors said.
[03:13:53.561 --> 03:13:57.824]  So ten out of the 13 that were charged were undocumented immigrants.
[03:13:57.844 --> 03:13:59.045]  See, we can't, even when they
[03:13:59.645 --> 03:14:03.448]  Beat people to death with machetes and baseball bats.
[03:14:03.828 --> 03:14:07.551]  We can't find it amongst ourselves.
[03:14:07.631 --> 03:14:10.293]  And of course, the people who are reporting this are the New York Times.
[03:14:10.714 --> 03:14:13.316]  The New York Times can't even call them criminals at that point.
[03:14:14.197 --> 03:14:21.923]  See, they're foreign citizens, in El Salvador in this instance, foreign citizens who are criminally trespassing in our country.
[03:14:22.731 --> 03:14:23.551]  They can't call them that.
[03:14:24.011 --> 03:14:25.432]  They won't call them illegal aliens.
[03:14:26.032 --> 03:14:32.933]  They have to call them undocumented immigrants even though they are gang members from a foreign country here illegally.
[03:14:33.313 --> 03:14:35.114]  That's the amazing story to me.
[03:14:35.454 --> 03:14:42.675]  But I also want to take a look at this story that Mike Cernovich was on just in the last segment with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:14:42.795 --> 03:14:43.576]  The story that he broke.
[03:14:43.616 --> 03:14:45.116]  I think this is amazing.
[03:14:45.856 --> 03:14:50.558]  Because what we see here, folks, is nothing less than Google going to war against the First Amendment.
[03:14:51.098 --> 03:14:54.160]  And, of course, InfoWars is their first target.
[03:14:54.720 --> 03:15:01.483]  Google has hired contractors, say the article, to remove or to limit Alex Jones' website, InfoWars.com, from his search engine.
[03:15:02.683 --> 03:15:05.188]  Not just somebody told us this.
[03:15:05.228 --> 03:15:12.640]  We have documentary proof, we have screenshots that were sent to Mike Cernovich, and we show these in the document here.
[03:15:13.061 --> 03:15:15.185]  Understand what this is truly about.
[03:15:15.365 --> 03:15:16.126]  There's two things here.
[03:15:17.301 --> 03:15:29.004]  Number one, with Operation Mockingbird and with just three networks, ABC, NBC and CBS, they were able to give you the same story all the time and present it exactly the same way.
[03:15:29.844 --> 03:15:34.085]  Give you the same spin on the same stories, put out the government's official story.
[03:15:34.205 --> 03:15:40.407]  Anybody who questioned the government's official story was dismissed as a conspiracy theorist or lunatic French.
[03:15:41.207 --> 03:15:43.228]  They lost control of that narrative.
[03:15:44.008 --> 03:15:48.630]  And they have said, hey, you know, the people on this, now they want to call us fake news.
[03:15:48.650 --> 03:15:50.791]  They say, the fake news influenced the election.
[03:15:51.491 --> 03:15:56.433]  They controlled elections through their fake narrative for a very long time with Operation Mockingbird.
[03:15:57.073 --> 03:15:59.054]  And so what they're trying to do is they're trying to get it back.
[03:15:59.074 --> 03:16:03.636]  And they're trying to get it back also for profit reasons, but it's also a political power play.
[03:16:04.336 --> 03:16:09.158]  See, when you want to get monopolies handed to you by the government, and we'll talk about that here in a moment,
[03:16:09.861 --> 03:16:16.204]  When Google and others want monopolies, they do a scratch my back, I'll scratch yours type of thing with the government.
[03:16:16.724 --> 03:16:21.346]  This is what they're doing right now, saying InfoWars articles must be rated low to medium.
[03:16:21.366 --> 03:16:23.427]  They say you should be mindful of where the article comes.
[03:16:23.487 --> 03:16:26.069]  In other words, don't look at what it's saying.
[03:16:26.849 --> 03:16:28.469]  Don't exercise your critical thought.
[03:16:29.089 --> 03:16:31.010]  Just dismiss it because of where it's coming from.
[03:16:31.670 --> 03:16:32.750]  Now that is nonsense.
[03:16:33.510 --> 03:16:35.411]  And I've even seen that from people who follow me.
[03:16:35.471 --> 03:16:39.692]  I've reported things that the Washington Post has said, or the New York Times has said.
[03:16:39.732 --> 03:16:41.232]  And they say, well, you can't trust that.
[03:16:42.952 --> 03:16:43.512]  I see the source.
[03:16:43.532 --> 03:16:44.573]  I'm not going to pay attention to that.
[03:16:45.153 --> 03:16:45.993]  Well, that's nonsense.
[03:16:46.733 --> 03:16:47.453]  Read the source.
[03:16:47.793 --> 03:16:52.074]  And just as I pointed out in this last story with the New York Times, they gave factual information.
[03:16:52.674 --> 03:16:55.655]  And then they spin it by saying, well, some of them were undocumented immigrants.
[03:16:56.275 --> 03:17:09.948]  But they do tell you, if you read between the lines, that 10 out of 13 of these people were foreign citizens criminally trespassing and killing people with machetes as they are acting as a drug gang.
[03:17:11.223 --> 03:17:14.325]  What they want to do is establish a system that they've had before.
[03:17:14.705 --> 03:17:17.466]  It was true because Walter Cronkite said so.
[03:17:17.926 --> 03:17:19.427]  That's the way it is, right?
[03:17:19.787 --> 03:17:21.808]  So because he said so, it was true.
[03:17:22.409 --> 03:17:25.230]  You establish the argument from authority.
[03:17:25.790 --> 03:17:27.651]  I'm the person in authority, so therefore it's true.
[03:17:27.972 --> 03:17:29.452]  If it's coming from CNN, it's true.
[03:17:29.592 --> 03:17:31.413]  If it's coming from Infowars, it's not true.
[03:17:31.693 --> 03:17:32.994]  And you can dismiss that right away.
[03:17:33.074 --> 03:17:34.035]  That is precisely
[03:17:34.855 --> 03:17:37.236]  What Google is saying with this.
[03:17:37.356 --> 03:17:47.922]  And of course, even if it is something that is linked to by Drudge, and Drudge links to the New York Times, it links to Washington Post, CNN, all these different places as well, but if Drudge linked to it, it's also fake news.
[03:17:48.102 --> 03:17:49.443]  So you can count on that.
[03:17:50.143 --> 03:17:54.946]  What they're trying to do is establish complete control over the news media as they did before.
[03:17:56.062 --> 03:17:59.064]  And we may say, well, there's a lot of different outlets out there.
[03:17:59.084 --> 03:18:03.107]  There's there's Infowars, there's Breitbart, there's Daily Caller, there's social media.
[03:18:03.167 --> 03:18:04.508]  You can pass the information around.
[03:18:05.409 --> 03:18:07.671]  But we've also seen how the different
[03:18:08.701 --> 03:18:11.282]  News organizations have been tightly consolidated.
[03:18:11.742 --> 03:18:12.562]  Less than five.
[03:18:13.103 --> 03:18:14.343]  Companies own everything.
[03:18:14.783 --> 03:18:16.104]  That was that a couple years ago.
[03:18:16.144 --> 03:18:17.844]  I'm sure it's less than that now.
[03:18:18.445 --> 03:18:27.328]  And so, in terms of corporate control, it's even tighter control than it was during the days when we just had three networks.
[03:18:27.768 --> 03:18:32.910]  Because in those days, we had some vibrant local newspapers as well that would come into the mix.
[03:18:33.910 --> 03:18:38.354]  But the mainstream media, that was broadcast media, was tightly controlled.
[03:18:38.394 --> 03:18:41.697]  They want to re-establish that tight control that they've lost with the internet.
[03:18:42.418 --> 03:18:44.160]  They go in here as a bonus example.
[03:18:44.180 --> 03:18:45.901]  They say, well what about this news article?
[03:18:46.021 --> 03:18:47.923]  And they use the example of the SOD.
[03:18:47.963 --> 03:18:50.485]  This is the article that Adon Salazar put out last Friday.
[03:18:51.306 --> 03:18:55.287]  And so this is something that has just happened, that they've just put this out this weekend.
[03:18:55.728 --> 03:18:57.468]  Mike Cernovich got this document right away.
[03:18:57.568 --> 03:18:58.849]  So they say, what about this news article?
[03:18:59.489 --> 03:19:00.949]  Here's another one from CNN.
[03:19:00.989 --> 03:19:03.230]  Covers the same subject that InfoWars did.
[03:19:03.250 --> 03:19:04.271]  Okay?
[03:19:04.631 --> 03:19:10.453]  They say, we give this a rating of high to high plus, even though we give InfoWars the lowest rating.
[03:19:10.553 --> 03:19:10.853]  Why?
[03:19:11.769 --> 03:19:18.192]  Well, they say, while CNN isn't a perfect news outlet, it's a popular news source that covers the story with depth and straightforward reporting.
[03:19:18.232 --> 03:19:18.792]  Why is that?
[03:19:19.272 --> 03:19:26.375]  Well, because we talked to people like Congressman Ron Paul, and they said, uh, that cuts against the grain, to say the least.
[03:19:27.016 --> 03:19:28.196]  See, that's exactly what we do.
[03:19:28.676 --> 03:19:29.397]  We cut against the grain.
[03:19:30.325 --> 03:19:36.367]  We deviate from the official government story even when the president is somebody that we supported, Donald Trump.
[03:19:36.407 --> 03:19:38.287]  We're not going to blindly follow him.
[03:19:38.947 --> 03:19:40.428]  Now you see though, CNN is.
[03:19:40.788 --> 03:19:42.248]  CNN is following it because why?
[03:19:42.548 --> 03:19:43.789]  It's about their agenda.
[03:19:44.349 --> 03:19:45.689]  They are not objective.
[03:19:46.089 --> 03:19:49.691]  We need to understand that they're coming from an ideological standpoint.
[03:19:49.731 --> 03:19:54.312]  They're selling the government's neocon military-industrial complex agenda.
[03:19:54.712 --> 03:19:56.292]  We're pushing back against that.
[03:19:56.452 --> 03:19:57.453]  They call us fake.
[03:19:57.473 --> 03:19:58.133]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:03.324 --> 03:20:05.106]  You provided, Alex, with the caveman?
[03:20:05.126 --> 03:20:07.187]  Well, so we've been formulating this stuff for a while.
[03:20:07.247 --> 03:20:10.650]  We've been getting these different flavors, and you know, oh, I don't know about this one.
[03:20:11.091 --> 03:20:14.093]  You know, and so I've been taking that stuff, and I'm an old man.
[03:20:14.113 --> 03:20:14.693]  I'm 42.
[03:20:14.733 --> 03:20:17.636]  I work out five times a week, if not more.
[03:20:17.796 --> 03:20:19.257]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[03:20:21.679 --> 03:20:22.319]  No, I'm not.
[03:20:22.379 --> 03:20:23.020]  I'm terrible.
[03:20:23.060 --> 03:20:23.600]  I'm terrible.
[03:20:23.700 --> 03:20:30.845]  But the point is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[03:20:31.445 --> 03:20:38.670]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula has just worked magic for me.
[03:20:38.710 --> 03:20:42.192]  And that's just from my personal experience.
[03:20:43.573 --> 03:20:48.818]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[03:20:48.858 --> 03:20:51.941]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[03:20:52.341 --> 03:20:53.643]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[03:20:54.023 --> 03:20:55.204]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[03:20:55.284 --> 03:20:56.425]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[03:20:56.445 --> 03:21:03.632]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[03:21:04.212 --> 03:21:11.795]  So, but the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[03:21:11.855 --> 03:21:13.575]  I felt it immediately.
[03:21:13.795 --> 03:21:15.816]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[03:21:15.896 --> 03:21:18.977]  Like, I'm really picky and I will drink it.
[03:21:19.037 --> 03:21:20.137]  It tastes good to me.
[03:21:20.237 --> 03:21:24.179]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[03:21:24.219 --> 03:21:26.199]  So, I mean, if the bone broth...
[03:21:28.960 --> 03:21:30.041]  Bone broth!
[03:21:30.121 --> 03:21:35.246]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[03:21:35.266 --> 03:21:39.009]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[03:21:39.049 --> 03:21:46.816]  So ladies, get yourself some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[03:21:46.876 --> 03:21:51.580]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my... Maybe get it for your wife then too, or girlfriend.
[03:21:51.600 --> 03:21:51.921]  Right?
[03:21:52.762 --> 03:21:55.489]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street.
[03:21:55.509 --> 03:21:58.777]  I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[03:21:59.138 --> 03:22:00.060]  No fear, nothing.
[03:22:01.032 --> 03:22:09.035]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[03:22:09.095 --> 03:22:10.736]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[03:22:11.456 --> 03:22:22.000]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[03:22:22.060 --> 03:22:23.300]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[03:22:23.340 --> 03:22:29.443]  I know it looks like we're in a billion dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[03:22:31.183 --> 03:22:32.964]  I borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[03:22:33.004 --> 03:22:35.205]  This is all money that's come from you, the listeners.
[03:22:35.225 --> 03:22:43.309]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[03:22:43.329 --> 03:22:46.651]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[03:22:46.691 --> 03:22:49.552]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[03:22:49.652 --> 03:22:54.695]  So once again, we got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us.
[03:22:55.735 --> 03:23:02.599]  Even when we make mistakes, and even when we're not right, and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us, and I appreciate that.
[03:23:13.245 --> 03:23:21.170]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:23:21.210 --> 03:23:24.312]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[03:23:25.117 --> 03:23:26.937]  And they're also very affordable.
[03:23:26.957 --> 03:23:27.297]  Exactly.
[03:23:27.317 --> 03:23:29.098]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[03:23:29.118 --> 03:23:32.439]  You talk about we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[03:23:32.479 --> 03:23:33.759]  We've both talked to them.
[03:23:33.959 --> 03:23:42.921]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[03:23:43.801 --> 03:23:44.881]  We refuse to screw people.
[03:23:45.241 --> 03:23:46.201]  We refuse to do that.
[03:23:46.581 --> 03:23:48.562]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[03:23:49.102 --> 03:23:55.853]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[03:23:56.253 --> 03:23:57.014]  It's a win-win.
[03:23:57.495 --> 03:23:58.457]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:24:21.007 --> 03:24:22.408]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:22.468 --> 03:24:27.390]  I'm David Knight, and we're taking a look at the attack on InfoWars by Google.
[03:24:27.410 --> 03:24:35.555]  This is absolutely amazing what Mike Cernovich showed us over the weekend, and this is something where they use as an example a story that came out on Friday.
[03:24:36.667 --> 03:24:40.092]  And so they wasted no time, the whistleblowers, in getting this to us.
[03:24:40.152 --> 03:24:43.596]  It is very important that we understand what their tactics are.
[03:24:43.777 --> 03:24:46.100]  And it's not just suppressing political speech, of course.
[03:24:46.120 --> 03:24:48.623]  They have a vested economic interest in that.
[03:24:48.663 --> 03:24:51.887]  There's a great story by Jerome Corsi on Infowars.com that points that out.
[03:24:52.248 --> 03:24:53.610]  I'm going to get to that in just a moment.
[03:24:53.650 --> 03:24:54.171]  Before we do...
[03:24:54.891 --> 03:24:58.955]  I want to point out that we have a way for you to help us as they try to shut us down.
[03:24:59.295 --> 03:25:02.598]  They're working against us economically as well.
[03:25:02.618 --> 03:25:11.847]  In other words, they want to block sites like ours and Breitbart and Daily Caller from accepting ads from people saying that we're an unacceptable site to have ads served on.
[03:25:12.327 --> 03:25:16.792]  Then they want to block our supplement ads which are from a completely separate site.
[03:25:17.506 --> 03:25:21.650]  There's a picture of a supplement and they want to make sure that that doesn't go out.
[03:25:22.090 --> 03:25:24.312]  So they block us putting our ads on other people.
[03:25:24.352 --> 03:25:26.274]  They block us accepting ads from other people.
[03:25:26.294 --> 03:25:28.075]  They're trying to shut us down economically.
[03:25:28.495 --> 03:25:30.777]  And now what they're trying to do is shut down our content.
[03:25:30.837 --> 03:25:38.684]  And we've seen this with Facebook working with government agencies to identify, as they point out, fake news sources.
[03:25:38.824 --> 03:25:41.887]  And now what they're saying is everything that we do is fake.
[03:25:41.947 --> 03:25:42.848]  And they give the example
[03:25:43.548 --> 03:25:44.028]  I don't know.
[03:26:00.549 --> 03:26:01.069]  And you can.
[03:26:01.129 --> 03:26:02.611]  We've also put out a special.
[03:26:02.651 --> 03:26:04.472]  We've extended the Easter Mega Special.
[03:26:05.153 --> 03:26:10.276]  We have 25% off a variety of the products that we sell at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:26:10.296 --> 03:26:13.739]  We have 25% off Super Male Vitality and Super Female Vitality.
[03:26:14.179 --> 03:26:17.522]  We have 25% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix.
[03:26:17.982 --> 03:26:22.425]  We also have 25% off our Vitamin B12 supplement, Secret 12.
[03:26:23.366 --> 03:26:27.429]  And we have 25% off Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.
[03:26:27.449 --> 03:26:29.531]  A good time to get stocked up on this.
[03:26:29.571 --> 03:26:36.856]  We're starting to get a threat to our deep earth supply of iodine as well.
[03:26:36.896 --> 03:26:40.299]  So this is a great time to stock up on this, especially while it's 25% off.
[03:26:40.959 --> 03:26:43.501]  And I also want to tell you about our free newsletter.
[03:26:43.981 --> 03:26:49.986]  Because as they try to suppress our stories, try to label everything we do as fake, and that
[03:26:50.686 --> 03:26:54.748]  Should be obvious to you as to what they're doing when they try to shut down an entire news organization.
[03:26:55.208 --> 03:26:57.689]  You can go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:26:57.709 --> 03:26:59.430]  You can sign up for our free newsletter there.
[03:26:59.951 --> 03:27:07.874]  You can get stories directly as well as daily specials that you will find as a part of that newsletter once you subscribe to that.
[03:27:08.275 --> 03:27:14.478]  I want to go back to this story and I want to look at the example that they gave, which was Adan's story from April the 13th.
[03:27:15.723 --> 03:27:18.947]  And in it, what we did was reported that Assad said that the U.S.
[03:27:18.987 --> 03:27:22.551]  had fabricated chemical weapons attack, that these videos could be staged.
[03:27:22.972 --> 03:27:26.856]  He said the West fabricated the whole story in order to have a pretext for the attack.
[03:27:27.697 --> 03:27:31.699]  Now, we said that we believe that this was being used from the very beginning.
[03:27:32.319 --> 03:27:32.819]  We said this.
[03:27:33.139 --> 03:27:34.420]  And of course, we said it four years ago.
[03:27:35.220 --> 03:27:42.843]  And we were joined in that by Donald Trump at the time, who said, well, we need to do an investigation before we act hastily.
[03:27:42.903 --> 03:27:46.304]  And we also have a requirement that the Constitution be invoked.
[03:27:46.344 --> 03:27:48.465]  We were not under an emergency attack.
[03:27:48.665 --> 03:27:50.946]  This was something that should have been done deliberately.
[03:27:51.406 --> 03:27:52.887]  We should have had an investigation.
[03:27:53.627 --> 03:27:55.028]  And when I reported this story,
[03:27:55.828 --> 03:28:00.931]  I also pointed out that Assad jumped the shark a bit when he said nobody died.
[03:28:01.352 --> 03:28:02.192]  So we don't believe that.
[03:28:02.833 --> 03:28:04.574]  You can look at that, and I believe people died.
[03:28:04.614 --> 03:28:06.415]  I don't think that that part of it was fake.
[03:28:06.655 --> 03:28:08.096]  But the question is, where did it come from?
[03:28:09.076 --> 03:28:22.005]  Whenever you do an investigation, if the government has an official story that they want to stick to, and an action that immediately follows that official story without an investigation, that is a hallmark
[03:28:22.813 --> 03:28:30.276]  That either they created this under false pretenses or they are spinning real events in order to use it for something that they've already decided they want to do.
[03:28:30.376 --> 03:28:35.018]  Like having a shooting immediately being spun to enact gun control.
[03:28:35.478 --> 03:28:41.120]  And so we pointed that out and we said we don't need to rush into this because we see that every time they've got an action that is already set up
[03:28:42.403 --> 03:28:43.783]  And they don't want to do any investigation.
[03:28:44.664 --> 03:28:47.705]  You can bet that they're not telling you the truth about what's going on.
[03:28:47.745 --> 03:28:48.845]  So we want to have an investigation.
[03:28:48.865 --> 03:28:50.166]  When you have an investigation, what do you do?
[03:28:50.426 --> 03:28:51.306]  You look at the motive.
[03:28:51.606 --> 03:29:05.811]  And in this story, Adan quotes Ron Paul, which, according to Google, was enough reason for this story to be delisted and put down at the lowest possible source, because we're looking at what Ron Paul says.
[03:29:06.471 --> 03:29:09.314]  Says, this is what Ron Paul said though, it absolutely does make sense.
[03:29:09.715 --> 03:29:15.501]  He said, it doesn't make any sense for Assad, under these conditions, to all of a sudden use poison gas.
[03:29:15.541 --> 03:29:17.703]  I think there's zero chance he would have done this deliberately.
[03:29:17.903 --> 03:29:22.068]  See, when you're doing an investigation, what you want to do is you want to look at who has a motive.
[03:29:22.829 --> 03:29:27.073]  Who had insurance on this person, this wealthy person, who was just killed under
[03:29:28.435 --> 03:29:30.076]  Uh, circumstances that are questionable.
[03:29:30.336 --> 03:29:32.896]  Well, it might be that those people are the ones who did it.
[03:29:33.557 --> 03:29:39.058]  But maybe if the guy doesn't benefit from this, maybe if it benefits these other people, maybe he's not your primary suspect.
[03:29:39.678 --> 03:29:41.959]  Then you want to start looking at something called evidence.
[03:29:42.399 --> 03:29:43.519]  And you want to have an investigation.
[03:29:43.759 --> 03:29:50.401]  But if you do that, when the government's already concocted its official story and the follow-up operation, you're denounced as a conspiracy theorist.
[03:29:51.001 --> 03:29:52.602]  And Google wants to make sure nobody hears you.
[03:29:53.427 --> 03:29:55.028]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.949 --> 03:29:58.751]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.414 --> 03:30:04.515]  Want to stop progress?
[03:30:04.755 --> 03:30:06.577]  Contact your local Progressive Democrat.
[03:30:06.757 --> 03:30:12.321]  With Airbnb rising in popularity, the hotel industry is freaking out and Progressive Democrats are responding.
[03:30:12.581 --> 03:30:18.125]  First, the Federal Trade Commission requested an investigation be done into how Airbnb was affecting the housing market.
[03:30:18.305 --> 03:30:25.867]  Why waste our money on that, I'm not sure, but Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo signed a bill making it a finable offense to post on Airbnb.
[03:30:26.067 --> 03:30:29.908]  Another example of the government getting involved in private business where it doesn't belong.
[03:30:30.148 --> 03:30:36.549]  If you violate a lease, that is between you and your leaseholder, but now the government has a preemptive strike against the Airbnb host.
[03:30:36.769 --> 03:30:41.170]  You can be sure this is a result of the hotel industry lobbying our fine politicians.
[03:30:41.550 --> 03:30:44.291]  Linda Rosenthal, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the bill,
[03:30:44.631 --> 03:30:49.815]  ...said, this sets a standard for those struggling with the impact of Airbnb on affordable housing.
[03:30:50.015 --> 03:30:53.919]  Which doesn't even make sense because innovation and competition always lowers costs.
[03:30:54.119 --> 03:30:56.080]  But these are Democrats we're talking about here.
[03:30:56.260 --> 03:30:58.282]  So don't bother trying to progress an industry.
[03:30:58.502 --> 03:31:00.604]  Progressive Democrats are waiting to stop you.
[03:31:00.784 --> 03:31:02.866]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:31:03.366 --> 03:31:11.130]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[03:31:11.350 --> 03:31:17.753]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:31:17.993 --> 03:31:26.277]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[03:31:26.557 --> 03:31:32.184]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[03:31:32.405 --> 03:31:35.308]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:31:35.569 --> 03:31:41.336]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:31:41.656 --> 03:31:42.136]  It works!
[03:31:42.417 --> 03:31:50.722]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[03:31:50.742 --> 03:32:00.288]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWareStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the InfoWare against the globalists all at the same time.
[03:32:00.628 --> 03:32:01.128]  A total 360 win!
[03:32:03.311 --> 03:32:04.753]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:32:04.913 --> 03:32:07.336]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.
[03:32:07.516 --> 03:32:14.804]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[03:32:25.655 --> 03:32:33.157]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[03:32:33.477 --> 03:32:43.439]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[03:32:43.679 --> 03:32:45.639]  And this part is most important.
[03:32:45.740 --> 03:32:52.181]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[03:32:52.541 --> 03:32:53.662]  That means it's clean.
[03:32:53.982 --> 03:32:55.022]  That means it's pure.
[03:32:55.122 --> 03:32:57.843]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[03:32:58.003 --> 03:33:00.765]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:33:00.805 --> 03:33:02.485]  Take action now before we sell out.
[03:33:09.068 --> 03:33:09.949]  You found it.
[03:33:10.289 --> 03:33:11.769]  The tip of the spear.
[03:33:12.049 --> 03:33:14.771]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.511 --> 03:33:19.293]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[03:33:24.013 --> 03:33:25.434]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.494 --> 03:33:31.979]  I'm David Knight, and we've been looking at Google going to war with the First Amendment, going to war first with InfoWars.
[03:33:31.999 --> 03:33:34.341]  You have to understand the principle that's involved here.
[03:33:34.381 --> 03:33:45.250]  The idea that if they're going to label things as true or false, and if they're going to take entire news organizations and say, even though this story is coming from InfoWars, you need to make that the lowest possible.
[03:33:45.290 --> 03:33:49.052]  But if it's coming from CNN, oh, rate that high or high plus.
[03:33:49.833 --> 03:33:53.076]  See, that's directly targeting people for destruction.
[03:33:53.736 --> 03:33:57.199]  Because they have lost control of the narrative and they want to get it back.
[03:33:58.015 --> 03:33:59.996]  We need to crowdsource this.
[03:34:00.056 --> 03:34:04.540]  It's one of the things that Paul and Mike were talking about was the importance of the comment section.
[03:34:05.200 --> 03:34:11.364]  And the fact that so many of them have now removed their comment sections because people weren't buying what the mainstream media was telling them.
[03:34:11.384 --> 03:34:16.688]  And they were having their own, I guess you could call it, it's kind of like what we had at the time of the revolution.
[03:34:16.708 --> 03:34:21.792]  We had committees of correspondence where people would talk to each other, tell each other what's really going on.
[03:34:22.432 --> 03:34:25.074]  Because there was control, always has been control on information.
[03:34:25.474 --> 03:34:27.175]  But let's take a look at the story that they picked out.
[03:34:27.295 --> 03:34:28.236]  The one about Assad.
[03:34:28.456 --> 03:34:32.199]  Today we had an article from the International Business Times.
[03:34:33.179 --> 03:34:40.564]  They're saying, well this is not credible because we've got Assad saying it, we've got Ron Paul saying it, we've got Infowars saying it.
[03:34:41.365 --> 03:34:43.526]  Now we've got an MIT expert saying it.
[03:34:44.327 --> 03:34:50.191]  Theodore Postol of MIT says there was no concrete evidence linking Assad to the attack.
[03:34:51.087 --> 03:34:53.370]  This guy is a leading weapons academic.
[03:34:53.871 --> 03:35:00.980]  He has claimed that the nerve agent attack in Syria was staged, raising questions about who was responsible.
[03:35:01.060 --> 03:35:05.886]  Theodore Apostol is a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT.
[03:35:06.887 --> 03:35:07.827]  He concluded that the U.S.
[03:35:07.847 --> 03:35:17.030]  government's report does not provide any concrete evidence that Assad was responsible, adding it was more likely that the attack was perpetrated by players on the ground.
[03:35:17.070 --> 03:35:19.891]  He said, I have reviewed the White House's document carefully.
[03:35:20.392 --> 03:35:27.034]  I believe it can be shown without doubt that the document does not provide any evidence whatsoever.
[03:35:27.861 --> 03:35:28.321]  That the U.S.
[03:35:28.361 --> 03:35:32.665]  government has concrete knowledge that the government of Syria was the source of the chemical attack.
[03:35:33.406 --> 03:35:45.197]  In fact, he said, a main piece of evidence that they've shown as a photograph, that's cited in the document to point to the attack, shows that it was executed by individuals on the ground and not from an aircraft.
[03:35:45.337 --> 03:35:47.779]  Now, let's take a look and pull up that picture that's in the article there.
[03:35:48.980 --> 03:35:51.542]  He looks at this picture, that one right there.
[03:35:51.883 --> 03:35:53.864]  He says, look, there's a small crater in the ground.
[03:35:54.625 --> 03:35:59.811]  Now the image he refers to is the crater with a shell inside that's supposed to have poison gas in it.
[03:36:00.291 --> 03:36:09.561]  His analysis of the shell suggests that it could not have been dropped from an airplane as the damage of the casing is inconsistent with an aerial explosion.
[03:36:09.982 --> 03:36:15.307]  He said it was more likely that an explosive charge was laid upon the shell before being detonated.
[03:36:15.968 --> 03:36:20.971]  He says this, the explosive acted on the pipe as a blunt crushing mallet.
[03:36:21.011 --> 03:36:24.352]  You see how it's crushed in instead of exploded out?
[03:36:25.413 --> 03:36:29.595]  It drove the pipe into the ground while at the same time creating the crater.
[03:36:30.675 --> 03:36:37.899]  He said no competent analysis would miss the fact that the alleged sarin canister was forcefully crushed from above.
[03:36:38.683 --> 03:36:40.947]  Rather than exploded by munition within.
[03:36:41.929 --> 03:36:44.915]  All of these highly amateurish mistakes.
[03:36:44.975 --> 03:36:47.420]  This is an MIT weapons expert.
[03:36:48.334 --> 03:36:52.816]  Okay, this is a guy who was a scientific advisor at the Department of Defense.
[03:36:53.596 --> 03:37:00.259]  He went there in 2013 when we had a similar false flag that was being used to get us involved in war.
[03:37:00.859 --> 03:37:02.780]  And again, that doesn't mean that nobody was killed.
[03:37:03.380 --> 03:37:05.101]  What it means is that they had a gas attack.
[03:37:05.161 --> 03:37:10.083]  And they immediately wanted to say, well, this was the Assad regime, so therefore we should
[03:37:11.207 --> 03:37:12.567]  Act as Al Qaeda's air force.
[03:37:12.587 --> 03:37:13.828]  We should send troops in.
[03:37:13.888 --> 03:37:20.090]  This should be the basis for an immediate attack, without any kind of investigation, without any deliberation by Congress.
[03:37:21.110 --> 03:37:23.711]  See, we have that in the Constitution.
[03:37:23.811 --> 03:37:27.872]  We're supposed to take the time to make this determination, if it's not an emergency.
[03:37:27.952 --> 03:37:28.912]  This is not an emergency.
[03:37:28.952 --> 03:37:29.353]  The U.S.
[03:37:29.653 --> 03:37:30.533]  is not under attack.
[03:37:30.813 --> 03:37:36.855]  We have the time to follow the law that they all swore to follow, that gives them their authority.
[03:37:37.930 --> 03:37:44.119]  Once we decide that we want to go to war, that it is warranted, then that is going to be our strategy.
[03:37:44.219 --> 03:37:47.804]  Then the tactics can be decided by the generals and by the president.
[03:37:48.564 --> 03:37:51.967]  Because at that point, it needs to be done quickly, it needs to be done secretly.
[03:37:52.348 --> 03:38:02.198]  But the deliberation, the decision as to whether or not we go to war, does not, should not be done immediately without any deliberation, without a vote as required by the Constitution.
[03:38:02.898 --> 03:38:08.064]  Now, this person who was a former scientific advisor to the Department of Defense, an MIT professor, Emeritus.
[03:38:09.204 --> 03:38:15.949]  And again, he pointed out in 2013 that the evidence did not suggest that Assad was responsible.
[03:38:16.609 --> 03:38:20.332]  That was also later corroborated by the United Nations and others.
[03:38:20.412 --> 03:38:22.213]  The Pentagon also said that.
[03:38:22.253 --> 03:38:24.415]  That's one of the reasons why that whole thing fell apart.
[03:38:24.535 --> 03:38:29.298]  And when this all began, we said at the very beginning, we have seen this movie before.
[03:38:29.858 --> 03:38:30.939]  We need to take our time.
[03:38:31.339 --> 03:38:33.141]  We need to not shoot missiles from the hip.
[03:38:34.110 --> 03:38:40.094]  We need to understand that this was, once we do an investigation, you will find that their evidence does not hold up.
[03:38:40.535 --> 03:38:43.457]  Now we find a week later that the evidence does not hold up.
[03:38:43.997 --> 03:38:58.087]  He said, all these highly amateurish mistakes indicate that this White House report, like the earlier Obama White House report in 2013, was not properly vetted by the intelligence community as they claimed.
[03:38:58.688 --> 03:39:01.110]  He said, I have worked with the intelligence community in the past.
[03:39:01.710 --> 03:39:10.252]  And I have grave concerns about the politicization of intelligence that seems to be occurring with more frequency in recent times.
[03:39:10.572 --> 03:39:17.814]  Boy, that is a mild academic understatement of what we're seeing here from the military-industrial complex.
[03:39:18.515 --> 03:39:23.176]  Interestingly enough, today we have a story on Infowars.com.
[03:39:23.196 --> 03:39:25.197]  This picture where Kim Jong-un's missiles faked.
[03:39:25.237 --> 03:39:26.137]  He has this big parade.
[03:39:26.937 --> 03:39:34.259]  And in the background of this BBC reporter, you see this missile there, and the nose cone is like, tilted up, okay?
[03:39:35.179 --> 03:39:45.762]  And I tweeted out, okay, I guess in the case of North Korea, ICBM means I can't believe it's a missile, because this looks absolutely ridiculous.
[03:39:46.363 --> 03:39:50.664]  And, you know, we're now, as this, they're trying to create
[03:39:51.886 --> 03:39:55.698]  A situation saying this is so critical, we've got to act right now.
[03:39:55.758 --> 03:39:57.183]  We've had this situation for 64 years.
[03:39:59.346 --> 03:40:00.486]  We've had this tense situation.
[03:40:00.506 --> 03:40:02.507]  The war has technically never ended between the U.S.
[03:40:02.567 --> 03:40:03.727]  and North Korea.
[03:40:03.747 --> 03:40:06.268]  We've just had a ceasefire for 64 years.
[03:40:06.868 --> 03:40:07.809]  But now things have changed.
[03:40:07.889 --> 03:40:09.069]  Now we have to do something about it.
[03:40:09.149 --> 03:40:09.389]  Really?
[03:40:09.409 --> 03:40:10.229]  Really?
[03:40:10.329 --> 03:40:12.590]  Is that really what we have?
[03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:16.751]  I mean, yeah, North Korea is going to continue to test missiles weekly until they get it right.
[03:40:16.891 --> 03:40:19.072]  Until they can get one actually off the launch pad.
[03:40:19.592 --> 03:40:21.333]  Are we really threatened by this?
[03:40:22.393 --> 03:40:24.255]  And is this the way that we need to do this?
[03:40:24.315 --> 03:40:27.317]  By starting a nuclear war at any moment?
[03:40:27.357 --> 03:40:28.938]  That's the top of the Drudge Report right now.
[03:40:29.038 --> 03:40:30.419]  Nuke war at any moment.
[03:40:31.020 --> 03:40:31.240]  Great.
[03:40:32.401 --> 03:40:32.621]  Great.
[03:40:33.221 --> 03:40:34.422]  That's not what I voted for.
[03:40:35.063 --> 03:40:36.083]  That's not what I voted for.
[03:40:36.724 --> 03:40:43.249]  And let me tell you, before we go into what this is all designed to cover up, let's talk about Google's
[03:40:44.574 --> 03:40:54.982]  You have to understand that as this was going back and forth, we had the ISP rule and everybody was saying Trump is attacking and destroying your privacy.
[03:40:55.042 --> 03:41:00.186]  They never complained under Obama when the NSA was doing all this stuff, right?
[03:41:00.866 --> 03:41:02.487]  They pretended that none of that stuff happened.
[03:41:02.527 --> 03:41:04.929]  Instead, now it's Trump is coming after your privacy.
[03:41:04.969 --> 03:41:11.154]  They have a problem with Google and Facebook collecting more information than your ISP could ever hope to know about you.
[03:41:12.327 --> 03:41:14.689]  And so it was all Trump, and he was coming after your privacy.
[03:41:14.709 --> 03:41:17.631]  And we pointed out at the time, no, that's not really what's going on.
[03:41:18.531 --> 03:41:30.879]  We have an economic competition between the social media companies like Google and Facebook versus the people who actually deliver internet to your home, the internet service providers, the ISPs.
[03:41:31.800 --> 03:41:35.863]  Now Google and Facebook are already monetizing all the information that they collect about you.
[03:41:36.618 --> 03:41:41.200]  The ISPs want to do the same thing, and Google and Facebook say, no, no, no, no, that would violate people's privacy.
[03:41:41.920 --> 03:41:52.964]  It doesn't violate your privacy if Google does it, it doesn't violate your privacy if Facebook does it, but it would violate your privacy if competitors to Google and Facebook were to do it.
[03:41:53.384 --> 03:41:53.884]  You understand?
[03:41:55.025 --> 03:41:55.725]  That's what it's about.
[03:41:55.765 --> 03:41:59.186]  It's also about a competition within the government agencies.
[03:42:00.107 --> 03:42:03.668]  So we have some government agencies, like the FCC under Obama,
[03:42:05.089 --> 03:42:23.163]  And the Federal Communications Commission, the people who had been tasked to essentially allocate and distribute a limited number of radio and television frequencies to allocate that spectrum to people, the FCC decided, remember they wanted to get into newsrooms, they wanted to see, how do you put your news together?
[03:42:23.643 --> 03:42:24.844]  Started to get into content.
[03:42:25.865 --> 03:42:32.230]  And then they wanted to extend their control over the internet in general because they're very interested in controlling content just like Google is.
[03:42:33.126 --> 03:42:42.154]  And so part of the pushback against this Obama rule that was put in at the last minute, just before he left, part of the pushback against that was a pushback against the FCC.
[03:42:43.775 --> 03:42:45.035]  Trying to take over the internet.
[03:42:45.395 --> 03:42:48.076]  And the pushback was coming from inside the FCC.
[03:42:48.156 --> 03:43:00.479]  The new chief, Ajit Pai, who was one of the people who was blowing the whistle on the FCC's actions when Obama was in charge of it and when they had the Democrats as the chief of the FCC.
[03:43:01.159 --> 03:43:04.140]  So understand that we've got all these different competing agencies.
[03:43:04.220 --> 03:43:07.241]  We've got the FEC, the Federal Elections Commission.
[03:43:07.961 --> 03:43:13.982]  And we had Ann Revelle there saying that we need to censor and regulate political speech on the Internet.
[03:43:14.022 --> 03:43:17.243]  She's still saying that even though she has left the Federal Election Commission.
[03:43:17.443 --> 03:43:18.223]  She's still saying that.
[03:43:18.283 --> 03:43:32.366]  She wanted to, again, she's talking about fake news and how they've influenced elections and saying that she's very concerned because there's so much information during elections that people can get to on the Internet.
[03:43:32.666 --> 03:43:33.686]  So we have to regulate that.
[03:43:34.527 --> 03:43:35.547]  You see, the First Amendment
[03:43:36.579 --> 03:43:39.700]  is first and foremost about protecting political speech.
[03:43:39.781 --> 03:43:47.724]  It's not about protecting your ability to get a government grant to put a crucifix in a vat of urine, which is what the left seems to think that it's about.
[03:43:48.825 --> 03:44:02.131]  We cannot allow them to use the Federal Election Commission to shut down Drudge, to shut down Infowars, to shut down Breitbart, to shut down anybody for whom they don't like the political narrative that people are coming up with, the information they're coming up with.
[03:44:02.771 --> 03:44:03.672]  We admit our bias.
[03:44:04.453 --> 03:44:06.015]  CNN doesn't admit their bias.
[03:44:06.336 --> 03:44:07.978]  Fox News doesn't admit their bias.
[03:44:08.238 --> 03:44:13.305]  The stories that you choose to report are an expression of your bias.
[03:44:13.365 --> 03:44:14.086]  Everybody has it.
[03:44:14.186 --> 03:44:15.127]  If anybody tells you...
[03:44:15.942 --> 03:44:19.063]  That they don't have a bias, that they're completely objective.
[03:44:19.643 --> 03:44:21.163]  Those are the people you need to run from.
[03:44:22.023 --> 03:44:23.864]  Those are the people who are trying to fool you.
[03:44:24.464 --> 03:44:28.905]  The people who report the news and then do an analysis of it, that's fine.
[03:44:29.125 --> 03:44:30.505]  You understand where they're coming from.
[03:44:31.186 --> 03:44:32.246]  And they can make their case.
[03:44:32.286 --> 03:44:33.886]  You can agree with them or disagree with them.
[03:44:34.186 --> 03:44:34.986]  You can have that debate.
[03:44:35.026 --> 03:44:36.727]  But if they tell you that they've got the truth,
[03:44:37.526 --> 03:44:39.367]  They're true, and everybody else is fake.
[03:44:39.407 --> 03:44:40.848]  Those are the people you need to run away from.
[03:44:41.329 --> 03:44:55.038]  Now, in this story from Jerome Corsi, he points out that InfoWars has previously warned that Google and the largest communication giants on the internet lobbied the federal government to define broadband in the way they would in the 1930s-style regulation.
[03:44:55.078 --> 03:45:02.603]  When they created the FCC, again, the purpose was to allocate a limited spectrum for radio or for television, any kind of broadcast medium.
[03:45:02.863 --> 03:45:04.564]  We don't have that situation on the internet.
[03:45:04.584 --> 03:45:07.046]  So what they're trying to do is trying to say, well,
[03:45:07.626 --> 03:45:10.568]  We have limited capacity, which simply isn't true.
[03:45:11.429 --> 03:45:22.718]  But by saying that they have limited capacity, then they push for net neutrality, which allows them to then regulate different industries to advantage one group over the other and allows them to regulate content.
[03:45:23.018 --> 03:45:24.219]  That is precisely where we're going.
[03:45:24.239 --> 03:45:28.242]  So there's a bureaucratic empire battle that's going on between these different agencies.
[03:45:28.302 --> 03:45:33.186]  The FTC has had very light control of the Internet, but now the FCC wants to control it very tightly.
[03:45:33.686 --> 03:45:36.168]  And Google is working with them, pushing on that.
[03:45:36.208 --> 03:45:37.029]  Now the story that
[03:45:37.549 --> 03:45:47.854]  Jerome Corsi has put in shows the political funding from Soros and from Google, and he goes down through a great number of organizations.
[03:45:47.914 --> 03:45:48.595]  He details this.
[03:45:48.635 --> 03:45:51.756]  You should take a look at this detailed report that Jerome Corsi has.
[03:45:51.836 --> 03:45:54.538]  I want to focus on just one organization, the New America Foundation.
[03:45:55.469 --> 03:46:05.504]  You'll remember about a year and a half ago, the New America Foundation had an editorial that I think was, I think it was CNN that carried it, but it was a guy from the New America Foundation.
[03:46:05.544 --> 03:46:08.989]  He was talking about how we needed to have a North American Union passport.
[03:46:10.051 --> 03:46:11.912]  We needed to have a North American Union passport.
[03:46:12.432 --> 03:46:14.073]  Full-on globalist.
[03:46:14.173 --> 03:46:15.234]  Who supports this?
[03:46:15.294 --> 03:46:21.837]  Well, Google was the largest corporate contributor to the organization in 2016, contributing more than a million dollars.
[03:46:21.917 --> 03:46:26.940]  Google chairman Eric Schmidt also contributed more than a million dollars to the New America Foundation.
[03:46:27.220 --> 03:46:29.961]  And he served as its chairman until 2016.
[03:46:30.001 --> 03:46:36.485]  This is an organization that was pushing North American Union and doing it openly.
[03:46:36.545 --> 03:46:38.746]  We put this article out there and said, look at this.
[03:46:40.011 --> 03:46:45.074]  They said that it didn't exist, that it was a conspiracy theory, that there was an idea that we'd have a North American Union.
[03:46:45.875 --> 03:46:52.699]  We had the Council on Foreign Relations talking about how they needed to have a security perimeter around the three countries, Mexico, the U.S.
[03:46:53.239 --> 03:46:53.759]  and Canada.
[03:46:53.780 --> 03:46:57.162]  And that security perimeter would be run by Homeland Security here in the U.S.
[03:46:58.042 --> 03:46:59.523]  Just get rid of all internal borders.
[03:47:00.163 --> 03:47:02.365]  They were pushing toward a North American Union.
[03:47:02.405 --> 03:47:05.367]  And then we had that article and said, look, North American Union passport.
[03:47:05.387 --> 03:47:05.867]  That's what we need.
[03:47:06.407 --> 03:47:06.908]  So we said, look,
[03:47:07.768 --> 03:47:08.669]  It's not a conspiracy.
[03:47:08.709 --> 03:47:09.749]  They're now admitting it.
[03:47:10.109 --> 03:47:11.210]  But who is funding this?
[03:47:12.070 --> 03:47:13.731]  George Soros and Google.
[03:47:14.912 --> 03:47:21.696]  So as we move with this and we understand where this is headed, understand that now you have nothing to fear from Google, right?
[03:47:22.116 --> 03:47:32.602]  We have this story out of Australia because American news organizations, I guess, are afraid to start covering stories like this about Google because they might get delisted as fake news.
[03:47:33.772 --> 03:47:44.023]  Says fears that Google's Hire, that's a new piece of software that they're going to offer for people, it's their new project, will allow employers to see your entire search history.
[03:47:44.063 --> 03:47:55.815]  So when you go in to apply for a job, Google will obligingly help them to look at everything that you've done online, everything you've searched for, all the places that you've gone, all the YouTube videos that you've looked at.
[03:47:57.108 --> 03:47:57.788]  How do you like that?
[03:47:58.209 --> 03:48:00.490]  See, that's how they monetize you.
[03:48:00.570 --> 03:48:04.151]  When you've got something that is free, folks, you are the product.
[03:48:04.792 --> 03:48:05.512]  You are the product.
[03:48:06.132 --> 03:48:10.674]  And of course, you're the product in terms of sending this information over to the government as well.
[03:48:10.694 --> 03:48:12.936]  That's why you should be very concerned about CISPA.
[03:48:13.396 --> 03:48:16.937]  About CISA is what they wound up calling it at the very end.
[03:48:16.977 --> 03:48:25.942]  They took out the P for protection, but what they're trying to do is protect Google and Facebook and any other company that would turn over information about you to the federal government.
[03:48:26.562 --> 03:48:29.603]  And not because you're the subject of an investigation.
[03:48:30.204 --> 03:48:31.444]  They want your metadata.
[03:48:31.804 --> 03:48:34.926]  Because they want to know what the crowd is doing.
[03:48:34.966 --> 03:48:35.506]  The Hive.
[03:48:35.566 --> 03:48:36.646]  What is the Hive mind?
[03:48:36.747 --> 03:48:40.268]  Google even calls it, well, they don't call it Hive, they call it Hire.
[03:48:40.548 --> 03:48:43.189]  We had the Vault 7 that was called Hive.
[03:48:43.690 --> 03:48:45.270]  That's the nickname they gave for it.
[03:48:45.290 --> 03:48:47.251]  But they want to know what the Hive mind is.
[03:48:47.871 --> 03:48:53.494]  Is their narrative that they've created, is it working on the public or do they need to tweak it a little bit?
[03:48:54.318 --> 03:48:59.401]  So that's why the government wants to get all of your information so they can control you.
[03:48:59.441 --> 03:49:02.363]  It isn't necessarily that you are a suspicious suspect.
[03:49:02.403 --> 03:49:08.907]  That's something that's coming as well with their minority report pre-crime analysis.
[03:49:08.947 --> 03:49:11.609]  They're already well into the software that does that as well.
[03:49:11.669 --> 03:49:12.870]  You should be very concerned
[03:49:13.570 --> 03:49:25.339]  That because you are part of a political view or part of a certain political spectrum that they see as a challenge to their domination, that they would single you out and accuse you of being a criminal.
[03:49:25.379 --> 03:49:27.040]  So that's one thing that you should be concerned about.
[03:49:27.080 --> 03:49:41.671]  But the other part of it is that Google and Facebook and these companies will turn, they might as well be countries, they will turn this information over to the government so the government can have a closed feedback loop to see if their propaganda is working on you.
[03:49:42.577 --> 03:49:50.282]  One of the things I want to get to before we run out of time, of course today is the day that you have to, last day that you can file your tax return.
[03:49:50.302 --> 03:49:52.783]  Of course you can get an extension on it if you want.
[03:49:53.423 --> 03:49:54.544]  Is anybody talking about this?
[03:49:54.584 --> 03:49:58.166]  We had the big riots, everybody focused on the quote-unquote tax day riots.
[03:49:58.186 --> 03:50:03.729]  I even put out a hashtag, tax day, before I realized it was about people who were only concerned about Donald Trump.
[03:50:04.330 --> 03:50:05.971]  They weren't concerned about the taxes they were paying.
[03:50:06.391 --> 03:50:08.112]  They weren't concerned about the taxes you're paying.
[03:50:08.532 --> 03:50:10.714]  No, it's the politics of envy.
[03:50:11.618 --> 03:50:13.459]  They want to make sure that Donald Trump paid taxes.
[03:50:13.479 --> 03:50:14.739]  They want to see all of his tax returns.
[03:50:14.759 --> 03:50:16.560]  Well, I want to see tax reform.
[03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:20.221]  I don't really care about Donald Trump's tax returns.
[03:50:20.301 --> 03:50:22.322]  I want to see Donald Trump's tax reform.
[03:50:23.162 --> 03:50:25.803]  And that was completely lost over the weekend.
[03:50:26.630 --> 03:50:38.745]  With all the narrative about all the military pageants that we're having all over the world, in Syria, in North Korea, our armada that we're sending over there to go after the people who can't even get a missile off the launch pad.
[03:50:39.285 --> 03:50:40.286]  What was lost in all that?
[03:50:40.787 --> 03:50:44.391]  Well, what was lost in all of that is what they've been doing to us with the Federal Reserve.
[03:50:45.052 --> 03:50:47.094]  What they've been doing to us with the income tax.
[03:50:47.114 --> 03:50:55.983]  And we had some people that were not protesting Donald Trump's tax returns, but they were protesting in front of the Trump Tower and saying, we want real tax reform.
[03:50:56.443 --> 03:50:57.504]  Nobody reported that.
[03:50:57.985 --> 03:50:58.846]  Nobody reported that.
[03:50:59.226 --> 03:50:59.566]  Stay with us.
[03:50:59.586 --> 03:51:00.147]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:08.308 --> 03:51:15.222]  On the line we have Bill Mitchell of YourVoiceRadio.com and he's also filming the show for his podcast.
[03:51:15.262 --> 03:51:16.405]  Bill, welcome to the show.
[03:51:17.467 --> 03:51:18.208]  Hey, how are you?
[03:51:18.248 --> 03:51:18.749]  Good to see you.
[03:51:19.725 --> 03:51:20.005]  Good!
[03:51:20.546 --> 03:51:24.448]  Now, I'm going to read you two Trump tweets, which he tweeted during the campaign.
[03:51:24.849 --> 03:51:25.669]  This is from Trump.
[03:51:25.849 --> 03:51:30.433]  Don't attack Syria, an attack that will bring nothing but trouble for the US.
[03:51:31.013 --> 03:51:33.595]  Focus on making our country strong and great again.
[03:51:33.955 --> 03:51:40.159]  He also tweeted, Crooked Hillary Clinton's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya.
[03:51:40.580 --> 03:51:42.281]  She is ruthless and dangerous.
[03:51:42.421 --> 03:51:56.489]  Yeah, I think a real danger that we get into when we judge someone's current actions by their former tweets is that they have new information that they've attained on their current actions that they didn't have when they made that tweet.
[03:51:56.869 --> 03:51:58.430]  And this is one of the things I like about Donald Trump.
[03:51:58.450 --> 03:52:01.371]  He's not a classic conservative ideologue.
[03:52:01.411 --> 03:52:02.192]  He's a resultist.
[03:52:02.712 --> 03:52:04.354]  He's a CEO type mentality.
[03:52:04.794 --> 03:52:08.979]  And you don't want a CEO that goes in making decisions based on pure ideology.
[03:52:09.019 --> 03:52:14.644]  You want a CEO that goes in and makes decisions on the latest, most up-to-date, best information.
[03:52:14.824 --> 03:52:22.712]  Donald Trump came in and when these gas attacks were reported, and apparently our intelligence supported that this happened, okay?
[03:52:23.013 --> 03:52:24.394]  When these gas attacks happened,
[03:52:24.754 --> 03:52:27.015]  And Assad was responsible, according to our intelligence.
[03:52:27.395 --> 03:52:29.916]  Donald Trump could either respond or not respond.
[03:52:29.976 --> 03:52:32.697]  If he didn't respond at all, that would be unacceptable as President of the United States.
[03:52:32.977 --> 03:52:35.858]  So if he responded and condemned them, then he had to act.
[03:52:35.978 --> 03:52:38.219]  If he did not act, then he became Obama 2.0.
[03:52:38.339 --> 03:52:38.679]  Okay?
[03:52:39.980 --> 03:52:43.061]  So he had to act in a surgical, limited way.
[03:52:43.221 --> 03:52:45.442]  And they followed the intelligence, and they did it.
[03:52:45.782 --> 03:52:46.502]  They acted.
[03:52:46.862 --> 03:52:48.783]  The upside to this is tremendous.
[03:52:48.863 --> 03:52:50.284]  You know, the entire... Here's the thing.
[03:52:50.824 --> 03:52:53.465]  The entire Russiagate thing just died.
[03:52:54.205 --> 03:52:54.646]  It's over.
[03:52:55.086 --> 03:52:55.366]  It's over.
[03:52:55.526 --> 03:53:04.194]  Because what person in the world would say that Donald Trump is acting as the puppet of Putin now that Donald Trump has basically stuck his finger in Putin's eye in Syria?
[03:53:04.615 --> 03:53:05.155]  That's over.
[03:53:05.295 --> 03:53:09.459]  Based upon what I'm seeing on Twitter, you know, you said that we're split on this.
[03:53:09.559 --> 03:53:10.560]  I disagree with that statement.
[03:53:10.820 --> 03:53:12.542]  I think this is maybe 20% against, 80% for.
[03:53:15.024 --> 03:53:17.926]  Okay, I see very positive support for Trump on this.
[03:53:18.207 --> 03:53:23.270]  I see the people that were initially very against this saying, I'm gonna abandon Trump on this.
[03:53:23.411 --> 03:53:24.631]  I'm off the Trump train on this.
[03:53:24.912 --> 03:53:25.993]  I see that fading away.
[03:53:26.153 --> 03:53:27.494]  You know, here's the thing people gotta understand.
[03:53:27.634 --> 03:53:29.115]  The Trump train has got many cars on it.
[03:53:29.475 --> 03:53:32.097]  If you don't like the drapes on one car, move to another car, okay?
[03:53:32.357 --> 03:53:36.661]  Because if you say that you're gonna abandon Trump on this, then what are you gonna do for the next four years?
[03:53:36.981 --> 03:53:38.242]  I mean, what about tax reform?
[03:53:38.502 --> 03:53:39.642]  What about health care reform?
[03:53:39.902 --> 03:53:40.703]  What about the wall?
[03:53:40.763 --> 03:53:41.943]  What about immigration reform?
[03:53:41.983 --> 03:53:42.783]  What about jobs?
[03:53:43.144 --> 03:53:43.964]  These are other cards.
[03:53:44.224 --> 03:53:46.285]  If you believe in those, but stay on the Trump thing.
[03:53:46.325 --> 03:53:47.165]  Don't abandon Trump.
[03:53:47.385 --> 03:53:49.266]  There's nothing wrong with disagreeing with Trump on this.
[03:53:49.286 --> 03:53:50.426]  He likes that feedback.
[03:53:50.446 --> 03:53:51.186]  That's important to him.
[03:53:51.206 --> 03:53:52.167]  That's part of his strategy.
[03:53:52.527 --> 03:53:54.567]  But in my case, I think this is a great move.
[03:53:54.627 --> 03:53:59.029]  I think history will look back at this as a turning point in the Middle East and a brilliant move.
[03:54:14.518 --> 03:54:15.819]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:15.839 --> 03:54:16.259]  I'm David Knight.
[03:54:16.279 --> 03:54:17.439]  We've got one more segment.
[03:54:17.459 --> 03:54:20.981]  I'm going to give you a tease of what's going to be on the InfoWars Nightly News tonight at 7.
[03:54:21.881 --> 03:54:22.621]  I'll be hosting that.
[03:54:23.522 --> 03:54:29.504]  But I want to remind you and thank you, actually, for standing with us, you know, as Google is moving against us financially.
[03:54:30.024 --> 03:54:39.773]  Moving to shutdown, people even being able to find our articles with search engines downrating us, setting up a system where they will be the arbiters of what's true and what's false.
[03:54:40.253 --> 03:54:41.595]  They will tell you what to read.
[03:54:42.095 --> 03:54:44.357]  They won't just report what is popular.
[03:54:45.198 --> 03:54:45.438]  That's...
[03:54:46.619 --> 03:54:49.782]  We need to have you standing with us, and we do appreciate you standing with us.
[03:54:50.262 --> 03:54:54.907]  In appreciation of that, we've extended the Easter Mega Special at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:55.307 --> 03:54:57.529]  Let me give you an example of some of the products that are there.
[03:54:57.549 --> 03:55:01.693]  We have 25% off Super Male Vitality and Super Female Vitality.
[03:55:02.073 --> 03:55:07.338]  We also have 25% off Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine and 25% off Vitamin B12 Secret 12.
[03:55:10.481 --> 03:55:12.863]  We also have 30% off Brain Force.
[03:55:12.903 --> 03:55:20.188]  And again, as I've pointed out many times, that is my favorite supplement in the sense that it helps me to focus my thoughts.
[03:55:20.508 --> 03:55:23.351]  It does not make me jittery like coffee does or anything else.
[03:55:23.431 --> 03:55:26.773]  It is my favorite supplement that we have at InfoWorth.
[03:55:26.853 --> 03:55:27.674]  You can find that now.
[03:55:28.454 --> 03:55:36.498]  30% off Brain Force and 25% off a slew of other products with our extended Easter Mega Specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:36.518 --> 03:55:38.239]  We really appreciate you standing by us.

[03:55:54.670 --> 03:55:58.695]  So again, you can find that at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:55:58.715 --> 03:56:02.339]  I was talking about Real Tax Day.
[03:56:03.280 --> 03:56:04.541]  Real tax reform.
[03:56:04.582 --> 03:56:05.102]  What people want.
[03:56:05.122 --> 03:56:16.775]  You know, we had a situation, as reported by WND, some people outside Trump Tower were saying, and this was Americans for Fair Taxation, they said, it's time to actually do tax reform.
[03:56:17.015 --> 03:56:17.956]  That's what I'm concerned about.
[03:56:18.016 --> 03:56:19.638]  Not tax returns of Donald Trump.
[03:56:20.439 --> 03:56:24.821]  I'm not interested in this misdirection of wars in foreign lands.
[03:56:24.881 --> 03:56:29.662]  I'm not interested in the misdirection of envy, which is what these people are trying to do.
[03:56:30.423 --> 03:56:31.983]  I want to have real reform.
[03:56:32.023 --> 03:56:33.004]  And here's a good example.
[03:56:33.044 --> 03:56:33.804]  I tweeted this out.
[03:56:34.444 --> 03:56:37.885]  This is an article from another organization, Americans for Tax Reform, ATR.org.
[03:56:39.906 --> 03:56:41.927]  104 years of the income tax.
[03:56:42.167 --> 03:56:47.248]  The income tax in 1913, when it was created, along with the Federal Reserve, then and now.
[03:56:48.068 --> 03:56:51.710]  In 1913, the top marginal income tax bracket was 7%.
[03:56:51.770 --> 03:56:52.190]  Today it is 39.6%.
[03:56:52.230 --> 03:56:52.510]  From 7% to 40%.
[03:56:57.231 --> 03:57:01.096]  In 1913, the marginal income tax bracket was between 1 and 7%.
[03:57:01.136 --> 03:57:01.958]  Today, that range is 10 to 40%.
[03:57:02.198 --> 03:57:03.239]  In 1913, there were 400 pages of tax code.
[03:57:03.500 --> 03:57:04.180]  Today, there are 74,608.
[03:57:12.157 --> 03:57:16.061]  In 1913, here's the kicker, folks, as you're doing your taxes at the last minute.
[03:57:16.481 --> 03:57:19.965]  The family standard deduction was $98,425 in today's dollars.
[03:57:19.985 --> 03:57:20.886]  What do you get today?
[03:57:20.906 --> 03:57:20.886]  $12,600.
[03:57:20.926 --> 03:57:22.147]  So it's gone from almost $100,000 to $12.6.
[03:57:30.635 --> 03:57:37.337]  And of course, there were only 358,000 Americans that even filed a tax return in 1913 when it started.
[03:57:37.697 --> 03:57:38.877]  That's the way this all starts.
[03:57:39.578 --> 03:57:41.818]  Every time they do this, they create a bureaucracy.
[03:57:41.918 --> 03:57:46.019]  It's a very, very small tax, or a very, very small burden initially.
[03:57:46.500 --> 03:57:48.760]  And then it grows, and it grows, and it grows.
[03:57:49.641 --> 03:57:51.041]  Unless it's something like Obamacare.
[03:57:51.441 --> 03:57:52.941]  And that came on like a lion.
[03:57:53.382 --> 03:57:57.563]  Immediately, people started seeing their tax insurance costs skyrocketing.
[03:57:58.363 --> 03:58:01.186]  What's going to happen if we don't repeal Obamacare?
[03:58:01.967 --> 03:58:03.908]  Now they're talking about making it work better.
[03:58:03.928 --> 03:58:09.634]  We're going to take a look at the Export-Import Bank and Donald Trump's pivot to that.
[03:58:09.734 --> 03:58:13.077]  What does that mean for us in terms of embracing crony capitalism?
[03:58:13.297 --> 03:58:14.318]  Boeing and GE love it.
[03:58:14.619 --> 03:58:14.879]  Why?
[03:58:15.099 --> 03:58:17.802]  Because there's only 10 corporations that get 60% of this.
[03:58:18.062 --> 03:58:22.806]  And we are subsidizing foreign, state-owned corporations.
[03:58:23.607 --> 03:58:25.889]  With taxpayer-funded loans.
[03:58:26.349 --> 03:58:29.612]  That ought to make you wonder if we're making America great again.
[03:58:29.652 --> 03:58:31.193]  They're reviving that, trying to revive that.
[03:58:31.353 --> 03:58:35.417]  We'll talk about that tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:35.517 --> 03:58:35.837]  Eastern.
[03:58:45.345 --> 03:58:49.288]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.177 --> 03:58:54.257]  You have no money?
[03:58:54.517 --> 03:58:56.478]  This is okay, we will take your blood.
[03:58:56.758 --> 03:59:02.099]  If you want access to the Vatican Museums, cash, visa, MasterCard or needle is accepted.
[03:59:02.419 --> 03:59:05.760]  That's right, you can give blood to access the Vatican Museums.
[03:59:06.000 --> 03:59:10.460]  The blood payment plan has a slogan, give blood and follow your artistic inclination.
[03:59:10.780 --> 03:59:14.041]  Blood donors then receive a voucher which gives them access to the museums.
[03:59:14.401 --> 03:59:18.042]  The director of the Vatican Museums said, without blood there is no life.
[03:59:18.522 --> 03:59:20.964]  Without art, life would be empty and sad.
[03:59:21.685 --> 03:59:23.367]  Okay, I love Jesus too.
[03:59:23.467 --> 03:59:24.147]  Happy Easter!
[03:59:24.848 --> 03:59:26.069]  I guess this is a good idea.
[03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:29.152]  Get some blood donations and allow people access to history.
[03:59:29.432 --> 03:59:30.774]  Sounds harmless, but wait!
[03:59:31.194 --> 03:59:33.757]  Each blood donation is good for a 4 euro voucher.
[03:59:34.137 --> 03:59:36.519]  It costs 16 euros to access the museums.
[03:59:37.240 --> 03:59:40.323]  So you have to donate blood four times before you can even get in.
[03:59:40.943 --> 03:59:43.566]  By the time you've given enough blood, you'd have fainted.
[03:59:44.347 --> 03:59:48.392]  Enjoy Michelangelo's Last Judgment as you recover from hypovolemia.
[03:59:48.912 --> 03:59:51.155]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schreier.
[03:59:54.078 --> 03:59:59.684]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
