[00:00:18.697 --> 00:00:20.918]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.058 --> 00:00:23.100]  It's Thursday, March 30th, 2017.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.861]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:26.201]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:30.836 --> 00:00:41.760]  President Donald Trump is expected to sign a bill today that will allow the tech giants to sell your private internet browsing history to the highest bidder.
[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:52.845]  And online privacy advocates are fighting back and they have raised over $200,000 thus far to purchase the web browsing history of members of Congress.
[00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:54.365]  Touche.
[00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:55.266]  Then.
[00:00:56.346 --> 00:00:58.167]  Back by popular demand.
[00:00:58.487 --> 00:01:01.808]  Judge Andrew Napolitano returns to Fox News.
[00:01:02.348 --> 00:01:09.050]  And he's not backing down over his claim that Barack Obama indeed wiretapped Donald Trump.
[00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.372]  All that plus MSNBC gets to decide what is racism and what is not.
[00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:20.274]  That's coming up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.336 --> 00:01:36.958]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:03.916 --> 00:03:17.644]  Well, immigration policy and sanctuary city status have been a big talking point lately and the reason why is because the liberals are virtue signaling and the conservatives are concerned about national security.
[00:03:18.104 --> 00:03:18.704]  Here's why.
[00:03:19.185 --> 00:03:22.406]  Now, we look at Europe and we use that as an example.
[00:03:22.466 --> 00:03:24.768]  This is a story you've heard of, but there have been developments.
[00:03:25.368 --> 00:03:33.332]  Afghan migrant is charged with raping and murdering EU officials teenage daughter who worked as a volunteer with asylum seekers in Germany.
[00:03:33.732 --> 00:03:45.098]  This is an EU official that had liberal immigration policies and the daughter of that official who actually volunteered time to help with these refugee seekers, these asylum seekers.
[00:03:45.618 --> 00:03:57.441]  Hussain Khavari, 22 years old, is accused of raping and drowning Maria Leidenberger, 19, allegedly ambushed her as she cycled home after a party in Friedberg last October.
[00:03:57.901 --> 00:04:04.162]  He was previously jailed for throwing a woman, 20 years old, off a cliff in 2013.
[00:04:07.608 --> 00:04:18.853]  Maria's father, again, is a senior legal advisor to the European Commission in Brussels and had liberal policies when it came to refugees and immigration.
[00:04:19.274 --> 00:04:23.316]  The boss of the country's police union said her death would have been prevented
[00:04:24.156 --> 00:04:30.640]  Had the door open, asylum seeker policy of Chancellor Angela Merkel had not been so lax.
[00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:36.564]  Kavari was born in Afghanistan, came to Germany as an illegal unaccompanied minor in November 2015.
[00:04:37.725 --> 00:04:40.407]  Again, that's after he threw a woman off a cliff.
[00:04:41.027 --> 00:04:45.891]  And thanks to Merkel's policies, now he drowns another girl.
[00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:47.231]  Absolutely sad.
[00:04:47.672 --> 00:04:53.756]  This is why conservatives have national security in mind when they take some of these refugee policies.
[00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:55.597]  Here's another example.
[00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:12.411]  A 20-year-old dating a 14-year-old?
[00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:13.532]  That doesn't seem right to begin with.
[00:05:13.872 --> 00:05:17.416]  Stalking her for months at Central High School.
[00:05:17.696 --> 00:05:23.142]  The victim's aunt told KETV that the teen reported the stalking to school officials, but nothing was done!
[00:05:23.202 --> 00:05:24.604]  Well, of course, you don't want to be racist.
[00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:27.888]  The girl alleges that Vargas Perez took her upstairs
[00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:28.969]  We're good to go.
[00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:56.863]  Nebraska Judge Jeffrey Marcuzo, this is the one that set the bond at $5,000, has a history of setting low bonds for illegal immigrants accused of heinous crimes.
[00:05:57.104 --> 00:05:57.904]  This has happened before.
[00:05:58.444 --> 00:06:09.169]  Eswin Mija, a 19-year-old illegal immigrant from Honduras, was handed a same bond of $5,000 after allegedly killing 21-year-old Sarah Root while he was street racing.
[00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:10.030]  And guess what?
[00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.551]  After he posted bond, he disappeared too!
[00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:23.268]  And this, of course, came a day after Sarah Root had just graduated from Bellevue University with a 4.0 GPA, folks.
[00:06:23.488 --> 00:06:26.493]  This is why conservatives have
[00:06:27.608 --> 00:06:30.491]  Really strict immigration and refugee policies in their mind.
[00:06:30.551 --> 00:06:32.113]  It's about national security.
[00:06:32.213 --> 00:06:34.035]  It's not about racism.
[00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:35.176]  I will go on.
[00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:40.221]  Father of Maryland teenager accused of rape is arrested on immigration charge.
[00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:46.107]  Now, this is a story that made the mainstream, obviously, but now the latest development is on the father.
[00:06:46.588 --> 00:06:49.751]  Here's Leanne McAdoo with more on this breaking story.
[00:06:51.067 --> 00:06:54.108]  Well, we've got the latest developments in the Rockville rape case.
[00:06:54.208 --> 00:07:02.391]  The father of one of the teenagers accused of raping a fellow student this month at a Maryland high school has also been arrested.
[00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:06.613]  Now, this is according to officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
[00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:14.816]  They arrested the father, Adolfo Sanchez Reyes, on Friday after a review of his immigration history found that he is here illegally.
[00:07:15.536 --> 00:07:15.736]  I don't
[00:07:35.191 --> 00:07:44.334]  Are they going to show some remorse and say we're so sorry not only are we here illegally and not only did we have some other pending charges and you still allowed us to come in to your high school?
[00:07:44.754 --> 00:07:50.756]  Why the hell as an 18 year old in the ninth grade with other 13 and 14 year old girls no one really knows.
[00:07:51.236 --> 00:07:52.696]  No remorse being shown here.
[00:07:52.756 --> 00:07:57.598]  They're saying the girl asked for it and that is how they're going to plead in this case that it was consensual.
[00:07:58.118 --> 00:08:02.881]  So they're making excuses for being here illegally and for raping a girl and blaming it on her.
[00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:04.281]  So this is how these people work.
[00:08:04.602 --> 00:08:05.302]  They're entitled.
[00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:06.082]  They want to be here.
[00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:26.314]  Now, this case is, of course, just going to further add fuel to the fire over the debate about illegal immigration and these so-called sanctuary cities, because the high school where this took place resides in Montgomery County, Maryland, where municipal leaders there have defied President Trump's calls to crack down on illegal immigration.
[00:08:27.054 --> 00:08:35.338]  The government officials and police there have said that they have a don't ask policy and they will not inquire about someone's immigration status.
[00:08:35.858 --> 00:08:37.199]  And just come on into the school.
[00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:42.722]  You know, we know you're old, too old to be here and that you got some pending charges, but just come on in.
[00:08:42.762 --> 00:08:43.882]  We won't ask any questions.
[00:08:44.183 --> 00:08:50.786]  So this case is just further, a further example of how illegal immigration is taking a toll on the American people.
[00:08:52.403 --> 00:09:04.127]  So, despite that story and the ones previous, you still have liberals fighting for sanctuary cities and open borders, and Spicer tries to have this debate when he takes the podium daily.
[00:09:04.607 --> 00:09:13.089]  Now, when he did take the podium, this was a while ago when the story was first breaking, Spicer says Maryland rape case shows need for illegal immigration crackdown.
[00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:14.330]  Well, exactly!
[00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.071]  Of course this story does.
[00:09:17.151 --> 00:09:21.074]  That's what you use these stories as an example for.
[00:09:21.154 --> 00:09:22.435]  You need national security.
[00:09:22.455 --> 00:09:26.398]  You need safe cities for kids, for families.
[00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:28.120]  I mean, this is a no-brainer policy.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.941]  I don't even know why we're having this debate.
[00:09:30.401 --> 00:09:31.102]  But we are.
[00:09:31.562 --> 00:09:33.243]  And look at how CNN spins it.
[00:09:34.424 --> 00:09:39.368]  How Sean Spicer uses rape case to scapegoat immigrants.
[00:09:39.968 --> 00:09:40.609]  Scapegoat.
[00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.631]  Now, there's all kinds of propaganda in this.
[00:09:43.691 --> 00:09:44.292]  First of all,
[00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:45.709]  Scapegoat.
[00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:53.252]  That is a phrase that they're using here to act like Sean Spicer is just trying to use these stories to make people look bad.
[00:09:53.753 --> 00:10:00.976]  No, he's using these stories to explain why he has, or why the President has these immigration and refugee policies.
[00:10:01.216 --> 00:10:03.957]  But CNN says that's scapegoating, and then what?
[00:10:04.397 --> 00:10:04.897]  Immigrants!
[00:10:05.437 --> 00:10:06.338]  More propaganda!
[00:10:06.838 --> 00:10:08.218]  This isn't about immigrants.
[00:10:08.578 --> 00:10:10.759]  This is about illegal immigration.
[00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:15.420]  This is how CNN twists headlines and uses key words and phrases as propaganda.
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.720]  Again, CNN.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:24.302]  Last week, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer weighed in on a crime that he called horrendous and horrible and disgusting.
[00:10:24.982 --> 00:10:29.603]  CNN says that, they quote him on that, as if that's some sort of a weird thing to feel and think.
[00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:33.464]  We're talking about a 14-year-old girl that got raped
[00:10:34.244 --> 00:10:39.891]  And CNN is quoting Sean Spicer saying that's horrendous as if Sean Spicer is a loon.
[00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:46.900]  No wonder CNN is failing miserably and completely just losing ratings by the day.
[00:10:47.984 --> 00:10:58.370]  Now, there's other reasons why we want immigration policies that keep American interests first, because we want people to be able to assimilate when they come to our country.
[00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.410]  Look at this story.
[00:10:59.871 --> 00:11:07.255]  Video shows, this is from Infowars.com, video shows Saudi man literally herding veiled Muslim women into a room with a stick.
[00:11:07.735 --> 00:11:09.296]  Go ahead and roll that b-roll, guys.
[00:11:09.696 --> 00:11:10.196]  Look at this.
[00:11:11.317 --> 00:11:15.019]  Is this the brand of Islam feminists want to import to the West?
[00:11:16.971 --> 00:11:17.611]  I mean, look at that!
[00:11:18.271 --> 00:11:20.652]  That's beating a woman on the head with a stick!
[00:11:22.752 --> 00:11:23.552]  So there you go.
[00:11:23.572 --> 00:11:26.513]  There's your religion of peace.
[00:11:26.533 --> 00:11:29.214]  There's your culture of tolerance.
[00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.354]  There's your feminist ally.
[00:11:32.474 --> 00:11:38.916]  They aren't allowed to show their faces in public, and if they dare step out of line, we're going to beat you with a stick!
[00:11:41.195 --> 00:11:45.778]  Yeah, we don't want to make sure that those people assimilate with our culture.
[00:11:45.838 --> 00:11:50.702]  Yeah, here's another woman talking about how if they step out of line, they get beaten.
[00:11:52.243 --> 00:11:53.164]  I mean, how dare they?
[00:11:54.517 --> 00:11:59.279]  But this is what we want to import and be tolerant of in the United States of America.
[00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:00.299]  You know what?
[00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:02.020]  I don't think so.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.400]  That's not going to fly.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.801]  Here in the West, we like our women to have their freedom.
[00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:06.881]  Sorry.
[00:12:07.542 --> 00:12:08.742]  Sorry about that, Islam.
[00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:11.903]  You can practice that if you want in your Middle Eastern countries.
[00:12:12.343 --> 00:12:14.264]  We're not going to have that in America.
[00:12:14.284 --> 00:12:14.984]  Okay?
[00:12:15.244 --> 00:12:16.525]  We like our women free.
[00:12:16.645 --> 00:12:17.085]  Thank you.
[00:12:17.365 --> 00:12:18.105]  Thank you very much.
[00:12:19.086 --> 00:12:19.226]  Now.
[00:12:20.424 --> 00:12:25.388]  The White House is going to continue to fight for our national security, continue to fight for our safety.
[00:12:25.868 --> 00:12:30.211]  White House vows to fight latest ruling blocking the travel ban.
[00:12:30.512 --> 00:12:32.593]  This is coming out of Hawaii again.
[00:12:32.613 --> 00:12:33.554]  A U.S.
[00:12:33.594 --> 00:12:38.758]  judge in Hawaii is keeping President Trump's travel ban on hold while the state's lawsuit works its way through the courts.
[00:12:39.398 --> 00:12:39.678]  U.S.
[00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:43.000]  District Judge Derek Watson.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.981]  Did you elect Derek Watson?
[00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:46.642]  I didn't vote for Derek Watson.
[00:12:46.662 --> 00:12:48.563]  I've never even heard of Derek Watson.
[00:12:49.064 --> 00:12:53.826]  Issued a 24-page order Wednesday extending his temporary order blocking the ban.
[00:12:54.187 --> 00:12:59.810]  So now we've got district judges holding up the President's agendas.
[00:13:00.686 --> 00:13:03.127]  Again, I didn't elect this district judge.
[00:13:03.527 --> 00:13:05.487]  You didn't elect this district judge.
[00:13:05.847 --> 00:13:07.748]  Why does he think he's above the president?
[00:13:08.028 --> 00:13:10.829]  Why does he think he's above the American people's agenda?
[00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:14.090]  This is a typical narcissist liberal.
[00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:19.611]  Because he's a social justice warrior, virtue signaling liberal, we'll see he has precedent.
[00:13:19.651 --> 00:13:20.511]  He has the high ground.
[00:13:21.272 --> 00:13:21.652]  Oh really?
[00:13:21.692 --> 00:13:29.554]  Are you still going to have the high ground if we start to see the type of Islam we just saw in that video where they beat women with a stick in this country?
[00:13:30.134 --> 00:13:31.175]  Are you going to be okay with that?
[00:13:31.435 --> 00:13:32.035]  How about this?
[00:13:32.095 --> 00:13:32.776]  This is a report.
[00:13:32.816 --> 00:13:34.117]  This is a story from the Daily Caller.
[00:13:34.277 --> 00:13:34.657]  Report.
[00:13:34.957 --> 00:13:39.560]  Growing Islamic extremism in Latin America poses major security threat to U.S.
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:48.445]  According to an analysis published this month by the National Center for Policy Analysis, the threat from Islamic extremists in Latin America remains an overlooked aspect of U.S.
[00:13:48.485 --> 00:13:53.909]  national security, NCPA Senior Fellow David Grantham argued.
[00:13:54.409 --> 00:14:03.415]  Yeah, and we have open border policies and sanctuary cities even though this is going on with a very lax southern border right now.
[00:14:03.775 --> 00:14:15.182]  Grantham noted that Saudi Arabia has invested millions to construct mosques and cultural centers in South America and Central America that expand the reach of its rigid version of Islam known as Wahhabism.
[00:14:15.642 --> 00:14:19.625]  That is a key point that many Americans are unaware of, folks.
[00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.566]  Islam really is trying to expand.
[00:14:22.066 --> 00:14:25.088]  And whether you think that's a good thing or not is your decision.
[00:14:25.529 --> 00:14:29.972]  But you need to realize what Saudi Arabia is doing and what the goals are of that.
[00:14:30.392 --> 00:14:35.636]  And again, why we want a tight border, why national security is in our interest.
[00:14:35.936 --> 00:14:43.242]  Not because you're racist, but because we want to protect the people in this country from violent extremists that are from other countries.
[00:14:44.221 --> 00:14:46.182]  But you still have liberals that are against that.
[00:14:46.502 --> 00:14:50.323]  Seattle files lawsuit over sanctuary cities funding threat.
[00:14:50.743 --> 00:14:56.324]  This, of course, is in response to Jeff Sessions threatening to cut federal funding from cities that are sanctuary cities.
[00:14:56.584 --> 00:15:06.067]  The city of Seattle on Wednesday announced a federal lawsuit over the Trump administration's threat to withhold federal grants to so-called sanctuary cities, citing 10th Amendment that deals with states' rights.
[00:15:06.507 --> 00:15:10.548]  Now, I think that this does raise another important argument to have.
[00:15:11.648 --> 00:15:12.949]  Does the federal government
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.305]  Have the power of purse over the state's rights.
[00:15:18.405 --> 00:15:21.729]  Does the federal government power of purse essentially trump state's rights?
[00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:30.298]  That's basically what Jeff Sessions is setting a precedent on if he was to cut the federal funding from sanctuary cities.
[00:15:31.323 --> 00:15:32.184]  I don't like that.
[00:15:32.304 --> 00:15:37.648]  Having said that, I do want him to impose this agenda because I don't think sanctuary cities is a good idea.
[00:15:37.928 --> 00:15:45.874]  But that is a very dangerous precedent to set the federal funding power of purse over states' rights.
[00:15:46.234 --> 00:15:50.137]  But it doesn't necessarily go against states' rights.
[00:15:50.197 --> 00:15:52.279]  The state still has the right to be a sanctuary state.
[00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:54.541]  You're just not going to get money from the federal government again.
[00:15:54.961 --> 00:15:58.544]  Now maybe we have a debate about should we be getting any money from the federal government to begin with.
[00:15:58.604 --> 00:15:59.605]  What is the federal government?
[00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:00.606]  Where does this money come from?
[00:16:00.986 --> 00:16:02.627]  Who knows if we'll ever go down that road.
[00:16:03.448 --> 00:16:05.950]  But that could be where an argument like that leads.
[00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.712]  But we do still have conservatives out there again.
[00:16:08.772 --> 00:16:11.674]  This is the battle for our borders, folks, for our country.
[00:16:12.115 --> 00:16:17.539]  Texas Governor Abbott, I will sign legislation that could put sheriffs of sanctuary cities in jail.
[00:16:17.919 --> 00:16:18.520]  How do you like that?
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:29.183]  Abbott said, we have been pushing a piece of legislation in Texas that is going to pass that I will be signing into law that imposes even sterner penalties on counties.
[00:16:29.663 --> 00:16:38.365]  It will include things such as further defunding them, it will impose fines, and it could impose jail time for these sheriffs to enforce the laws.
[00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:43.366]  Oddly enough, these sheriffs could wind up behind the very bars they are releasing these criminals from.
[00:16:43.726 --> 00:16:44.827]  Well, now hold on.
[00:16:44.847 --> 00:16:45.067]  If I
[00:16:47.744 --> 00:16:54.270]  So technically, I think that this is a very fair point.
[00:16:54.911 --> 00:17:13.287]  You know, if you're a sheriff of a city, or any elected official of a city, and you are providing status to illegals that are here illegally, or providing funding, or providing legal help to people who are here illegally, before you provide it to veterans or citizens that are homeless,
[00:17:14.108 --> 00:17:18.450]  And you're providing this to law-breaking people, you are aiding and abetting crimes.
[00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:26.414]  If I did that, if I had, say, let's say I tried to go across the border with five illegal citizens, five illegal immigrants, guess what?
[00:17:26.934 --> 00:17:28.375]  I would be part of a crime.
[00:17:28.615 --> 00:17:32.917]  So why shouldn't the people that are putting these people in their cities aiding and abetting criminals?
[00:17:32.957 --> 00:17:35.598]  They are, and now it looks like we'll have legislation to come down on that.
[00:17:36.298 --> 00:17:38.719]  Muslim professor insists Jesus wasn't crucified.
[00:17:38.759 --> 00:17:40.780]  Christian student suspended after disagreeing.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.301]  This was at Rollins College in Florida.
[00:17:43.581 --> 00:17:51.765]  A Christian college student was suspended after allegedly challenging his Muslim professor's claims that Jesus wasn't crucified and that his disciples did not think he was God.
[00:17:52.186 --> 00:17:52.786]  Okay, you know what?
[00:17:52.806 --> 00:17:53.866]  Have that debate at college.
[00:17:53.886 --> 00:17:54.367]  That's fine.
[00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:57.548]  Why does the student get suspended for having Christian beliefs?
[00:17:57.988 --> 00:17:58.969]  That's the real question.
[00:17:59.269 --> 00:18:05.772]  Why does the Muslim professor get to have dictatorship over the classroom with his or hers religious beliefs?
[00:18:06.172 --> 00:18:09.615]  You're not allowed to be a Christian now in a college classroom, apparently you're gonna get suspended.
[00:18:10.476 --> 00:18:12.077]  Well, we already know that what happens in...
[00:18:13.115 --> 00:18:20.500]  Iran, if you go against Islam, Iran sentences a 21-year-old man to death for insulting Islam.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:26.785]  An Iranian 21-year-old has been suspended to death after insulting the Prophet of Islam on an instant messaging app.
[00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:39.374]  Human rights activists claim that Degham was fooled into signing his own confession under the belief he would be released without punishment if he did so, but after signing the confession, prosecutors dropped the agreement and kept
[00:18:39.794 --> 00:18:41.615]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.697 --> 00:19:04.638]  We're good to go.
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.

[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-gmo organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.528]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.828 --> 00:23:00.752]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:04.929 --> 00:23:05.709]  Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:12.574]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com and today I want to talk about one of the most heated topics in America, and that's sanctuary cities.
[00:23:12.894 --> 00:23:17.577]  Now, there's this huge battle going on right now with multiple sanctuary cities and the federal government.
[00:23:17.917 --> 00:23:26.022]  Now, in case you don't know, a sanctuary city is an area that gives safe haven to illegal aliens that come into this country illegally, which automatically makes them a criminal.
[00:23:26.502 --> 00:23:34.628]  That's right, if you're an illegal alien and you come across our border without going through the proper protocols, steps, and procedures to become a citizen, you are automatically a criminal.
[00:23:34.968 --> 00:23:42.714]  I don't care if you've never committed murder, rape, or anything like that, you're automatically a criminal and I see you the exact same way as I do a pedophile or anyone else out there.
[00:23:42.734 --> 00:23:53.823]  Yes, that's my opinion, I said that, but I'm using that as an example, as a way to show you, in the eyes of the federal law, you come across this border illegally, you're automatically a criminal, and that is a point that needs to be made.
[00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:58.825]  Now, for instance, here in Travis County, we have Sheriff Sally Hernandez.
[00:23:59.065 --> 00:24:01.468]  She's one of these champions of the sanctuary cities.
[00:24:01.948 --> 00:24:08.355]  One of the first ones to come out in defiance of the federal law and the Trump administration saying that she will not uphold this law whatsoever.
[00:24:08.615 --> 00:24:17.283]  That when her deputies go out there and they make these routine stops and they're protecting and serving, that if they come across an illegal alien who's not committed murder, they're going to let him go.
[00:24:17.864 --> 00:24:19.465]  That's pretty much where she draws the line right there.
[00:24:19.805 --> 00:24:28.409]  Any kind of big crime like murder or something like that, that's when she's going to, okay, we're going to arrest him and detain him, and then eventually maybe we'll tell ICE or whatever like that.
[00:24:28.729 --> 00:24:30.850]  I really don't have a clear path to that point.
[00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.551]  But at that point in time, at least they're going to get arrested.
[00:24:34.597 --> 00:24:43.222]  What she fails to realize as a law enforcement official who's supposed to know the laws is that by coming across our border illegally, you're automatically a criminal.
[00:24:43.782 --> 00:24:52.307]  So within that federal law, when an officer pulls over that person or answers a domestic dispute call or whatever it is, they find out you're illegal.
[00:24:53.007 --> 00:24:54.670]  You should automatically be detained.
[00:24:54.991 --> 00:25:06.390]  That officer at that point in time should radio in, back to their talk, their tactical operations commander, whatever they call it in the police force, I'm using army terms, they contact their talk and they go,
[00:25:07.824 --> 00:25:09.004]  We got us illegal right here.
[00:25:09.304 --> 00:25:10.925]  I need to get in contact with ICE.
[00:25:11.425 --> 00:25:14.445]  We're going to detain this guy until federal law enforcement officials get here.
[00:25:14.886 --> 00:25:20.407]  And then at that point in time, when they get here, we will hand over that person into their federal custody where they will be booked.
[00:25:20.867 --> 00:25:24.988]  And they'll make notes of who this person is in case they come back across the border illegally.
[00:25:25.388 --> 00:25:29.949]  So we have a record of this individual in case they become an habitual line stepper.
[00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:33.571]  And at that point in time, they will be deported back to their country.
[00:25:34.031 --> 00:25:34.751]  That's not wrong.
[00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:35.692]  That's not uncivil.
[00:25:35.712 --> 00:25:38.233]  That's not something that's mean or evil.
[00:25:38.774 --> 00:25:39.474]  That's the law.
[00:25:39.534 --> 00:25:40.915]  That's how it's supposed to be done.
[00:25:41.555 --> 00:25:43.877]  Sheriff Sally Hernandez said, no, we're not going to do that.
[00:25:44.277 --> 00:25:47.759]  So on Monday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions came out and said, okay.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.160]  Don't do it.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.441]  We're going to cut your funding.
[00:25:50.821 --> 00:25:51.261]  Ha ha!
[00:25:51.541 --> 00:25:52.822]  Win for the Trump administration.
[00:25:53.482 --> 00:25:54.563]  Yes, cut that funding.
[00:25:55.043 --> 00:25:58.704]  And don't give them the money that they need because if you're not going to do your job, what good are you?
[00:25:58.805 --> 00:26:06.408]  Your job is to protect me, the citizen of Travis County in Austin, and my neighbors who are legal citizens and us, not people who came here illegally.
[00:26:06.728 --> 00:26:10.790]  Your job in that department is to detain them, notify ICE, and deport them the hell out of here.
[00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:15.852]  And the argument I always hear from the liberal left is, well, what about the families that are going to get separated?
[00:26:16.713 --> 00:26:17.273]  What about them?
[00:26:18.223 --> 00:26:19.403]  I've got a daughter on the way.
[00:26:19.864 --> 00:26:24.005]  If she's born in the next day or so, I go out and commit murder, guess what?
[00:26:24.405 --> 00:26:25.305]  Police are showing up.
[00:26:25.505 --> 00:26:26.226]  I'm getting arrested.
[00:26:26.266 --> 00:26:27.386]  I'm going to jail for life.
[00:26:28.546 --> 00:26:29.827]  No one's going to blame the state for that.
[00:26:29.847 --> 00:26:31.107]  No one's going to blame the police for that.
[00:26:31.187 --> 00:26:32.788]  My daughter will have to grow up fatherless.
[00:26:33.308 --> 00:26:36.749]  If your parents came over here illegally and they get deported back to their country,
[00:26:37.625 --> 00:26:38.165]  Guess what?
[00:26:38.646 --> 00:26:39.827]  I don't want to hear stories about it.
[00:26:39.887 --> 00:26:40.387]  I don't care.
[00:26:40.427 --> 00:26:41.528]  I'm not crying about that.
[00:26:41.808 --> 00:26:42.749]  I'm not going to feel bad.
[00:26:42.989 --> 00:26:45.491]  I don't want to read your op-ed on it, Huffington Post.
[00:26:45.571 --> 00:26:48.474]  I don't care what you have to say, because it's stupid and ridiculous.
[00:26:49.254 --> 00:26:50.075]  The law is the law.
[00:26:50.115 --> 00:26:51.216]  We are a nation of laws.
[00:26:51.496 --> 00:26:52.717]  We have a Constitution.
[00:26:53.017 --> 00:26:56.720]  And no, the Fourth Amendment is not afforded to you because you are illegal.
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:00.643]  That is a right that is afforded to legal citizens of America.
[00:27:01.044 --> 00:27:01.404]  Roger,
[00:27:01.784 --> 00:27:06.747]  So, the story, the moral of the story is illegal aliens are criminals.
[00:27:06.967 --> 00:27:09.849]  This should end the debate of this whole sanctuary city BS.
[00:27:10.289 --> 00:27:11.670]  No Sheriff Sally Hernandez.
[00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.372]  I don't care if they commit murder or not commit a murder.
[00:27:14.552 --> 00:27:15.412]  They're both criminals.
[00:27:15.472 --> 00:27:17.514]  If they come over here illegally, that is it.
[00:27:17.694 --> 00:27:18.214]  End of story.
[00:27:18.434 --> 00:27:19.735]  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[00:27:20.015 --> 00:27:21.936]  Stay tuned for more reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:27:22.196 --> 00:27:22.797]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[00:27:28.686 --> 00:27:32.308]  And now to Jon Balin with this shocking report from the EU.
[00:27:41.953 --> 00:27:54.819]  Sean Claude Juncker, the Luxembourgian president of the European Commission with a heritage literally making him the son of a Nazi, is taking a stand against all things populist Brexit and President Donald Trump.
[00:27:54.859 --> 00:27:56.000]  So Brexit isn't the end?
[00:27:59.768 --> 00:28:01.829]  A lot of people would like it that way.
[00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:20.777]  Even people on another content where the newly elected US president was happy that the Brexit was taking place and has asked other countries to do the same.
[00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:34.998]  And if he goes on like that, I am going to promote the independence of Ohio and Austin, Texas in the United States of America.
[00:28:35.378 --> 00:28:36.659]  Yonker, Ohio?
[00:28:36.959 --> 00:28:43.963]  Ohio had a very small secession movement in 2012, but that was a reaction to Barack Obama's re-election.
[00:28:44.103 --> 00:28:45.224]  Totally off the mark.
[00:28:45.404 --> 00:28:48.206]  California sure, but Ohio I don't think so.
[00:28:48.366 --> 00:28:56.171]  And then he names Texas, but not just Texas, Austin, Texas, as the other place he would support to secede.
[00:28:56.411 --> 00:29:06.458]  Unfortunately, as an Austin, Texas resident, a few things come to mind as to why he feels Austin would become just like his dear little country Luxembourg.
[00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:10.082]  Austin is a model UN Agenda 21 city.
[00:29:10.202 --> 00:29:22.895]  The politically correct Austin City Council is packed full of left-leaning, anti-fascist supporting miscreants that love spending our tax dollars on white elephant projects just like Juncker has done in Luxembourg.
[00:29:23.055 --> 00:29:34.624]  And a very public battle is brewing in Austin between the city council members, the Austin mayor, the Texas governor, and the Department of Justice over the controversial status of Austin as a leading sanctuary city.
[00:29:34.685 --> 00:29:39.669]  And I hope that law that gets passed isn't one that ultimately makes us less safe.
[00:29:39.969 --> 00:29:45.914]  And by that I mean our public safety professionals, our police chief, and the police chief before him.
[00:29:46.434 --> 00:29:50.636]  We have developed a real trust relationship in our community with all parts of our community.
[00:29:51.056 --> 00:29:56.238]  They say that's one of the reasons why we're one of the safest cities in the country, and we are.
[00:29:56.438 --> 00:29:58.559]  We're keeping this community pretty safe.
[00:29:58.619 --> 00:30:08.443]  Well, the governor would say, just look at this past case where there was a person who was arrested for a very serious crime, but it wasn't a crime that was listed under the sheriff's.
[00:30:08.943 --> 00:30:12.665]  I will cooperate with ICE and hold him for you, and he almost made bail.
[00:30:13.365 --> 00:30:18.310]  So how is that keeping this community safe when you don't cooperate 100% of the time?
[00:30:18.751 --> 00:30:27.199]  Austin Council Member Greg Cazar has dodged local Austin news requests to speak on his championing of illegal immigration.
[00:30:27.339 --> 00:30:30.963]  The Todd and Don Show on KOBJ-AM is set aside 7.20am.
[00:30:32.845 --> 00:30:39.273]  Every weekday morning for weeks for Khazar to call in and explain his side of the story to no avail.
[00:30:39.453 --> 00:30:43.197]  But Khazar had no problem speaking with Democracy Now!
[00:30:43.498 --> 00:30:50.186]  So for years our previous sheriff was deporting more people, helping in deportation of more people than almost any other sheriff.
[00:30:50.706 --> 00:30:50.886]  I'm good.
[00:31:12.535 --> 00:31:18.717]  That is politically motivated law enforcement actions that had nothing to do with public safety and everything to do with Trump's agenda.
[00:31:19.357 --> 00:31:20.657]  ICE denied that vigorously.
[00:31:20.977 --> 00:31:35.781]  And now in open court, a judge has confirmed what we all know, which is that unfortunately, we have a rogue federal agency that is not only tearing families apart, but threatening our very democracy by taking public safety actions and arresting people for political purposes.
[00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:45.825]  Yes, it appears that Khazar and Adler would easily carry water for an unelected globalist dictator on the other side of the Atlantic if asked to do so.
[00:31:46.225 --> 00:31:52.348]  I will not at each time respond to what you are saying because what you are saying is worthless.
[00:31:52.508 --> 00:31:53.829]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:32:13.263 --> 00:32:22.920]  By the way, here's a list of the evidence that they have gathered that would implicate Donald Trump and his staff in Infowars for colluding with the Russians.
[00:32:23.361 --> 00:32:23.681]  See that?
[00:32:24.482 --> 00:32:25.063]  They got nothing!
[00:32:29.338 --> 00:32:30.919]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.641]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:32:33.061 --> 00:32:33.321]  Okay?
[00:32:33.642 --> 00:32:36.504]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:32:36.684 --> 00:32:38.385]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:32:38.425 --> 00:32:39.766]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:32:40.067 --> 00:32:40.767]  This is Texas.
[00:32:40.987 --> 00:32:41.808]  You want to threaten me?
[00:32:41.868 --> 00:32:42.989]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:32:43.009 --> 00:32:43.650]  You understand that?
[00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:49.614]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:32:50.015 --> 00:32:53.838]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.438]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:50.861]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.881 --> 00:36:50.861]  $200.
[00:36:51.461 --> 00:36:54.404]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.484 --> 00:36:55.185]  It's amazing.
[00:37:06.149 --> 00:37:17.324]  I'm Millie Weaver and you're watching the InfoWars Nightly News and I'm going to be breaking down the top 10 fake news lies about Trump during the election cycle and after.
[00:37:17.344 --> 00:37:17.464]  Number 10!
[00:37:20.316 --> 00:37:23.338]  Nancy Pelosi's fake Mike Flynn tweets.
[00:37:23.658 --> 00:37:47.234]  Well this one was actually pretty funny because Nancy Pelosi and Representative Cummings bought into a fake Twitter account that they thought was Mike Flynn's and they read off a tweet about Mike Flynn saying he was going to be okay with being the scapegoat for the Trump administration and then shortly after they realized that in fact it was a fake Twitter account and it was not real.
[00:37:47.755 --> 00:37:48.916]  Number nine.
[00:37:49.836 --> 00:37:53.998]  The MLK bust was removed from the White House.
[00:37:54.599 --> 00:38:15.110]  Well, this one was from Zeke Miller, Times White House correspondent, who reported that the Martin Luther King bust was removed from the Oval Office from the White House, and it ended up being fake news, but it was too late, and it hit the press pool, it hit the circulation, and it went viral.
[00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:17.331]  Later, Zeke did come and
[00:38:17.771 --> 00:38:21.195]  Um, apologize to the White House for his mistake.
[00:38:21.595 --> 00:38:22.716]  Number 8!
[00:38:23.838 --> 00:38:30.004]  Nancy Sinatra's complaint against the inaugural ball song, My Way.
[00:38:30.585 --> 00:38:38.793]  CNN published an article titled, Nancy Sinatra not happy Trump using father's song at inauguration.
[00:38:39.694 --> 00:38:45.420]  Then, Nancy Sinatra soon after tweeted out, uh, that's not true.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.662]  I never said that.
[00:38:46.982 --> 00:38:48.464]  Why do you lie, CNN?
[00:38:48.904 --> 00:38:55.631]  Well, Nancy, that's a great question that I'm sure millions of Americans are dying to know the answer to.
[00:38:55.651 --> 00:38:55.771]  Number 7!
[00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:02.073]  Trump had a small inauguration turnout.
[00:39:02.554 --> 00:39:15.046]  Yes, the mainstream media was quick to post pictures at the inauguration ceremony of Trump's crowds saying that it looked surprisingly small and that Obama had a bigger turnout.
[00:39:15.366 --> 00:39:20.591]  Well, the problem with these pictures was that they were taken early, prior to the ceremony, and
[00:39:21.932 --> 00:39:31.301]  They didn't account for the fact that there was a major security threat risk associated with this particular inauguration ceremony.
[00:39:31.641 --> 00:39:35.845]  So there were actually security checkpoints that people had to go through.
[00:39:35.885 --> 00:39:38.747]  There was abnormal amount of screenings.
[00:39:39.128 --> 00:39:43.451]  So I actually was there and I saw the massive crowds of people.
[00:39:44.332 --> 00:39:49.234]  I mean, there was a line that went for miles, like 10 people wide.
[00:39:49.334 --> 00:39:50.354]  It stretched for miles.
[00:39:50.434 --> 00:39:51.095]  So many people.
[00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:54.136]  I've never seen that many people in my entire life.
[00:39:54.476 --> 00:39:56.897]  All Trump supporters trying to get into the inauguration.
[00:39:57.157 --> 00:39:59.438]  So a lot of them didn't even get into the ceremony.
[00:39:59.498 --> 00:40:01.979]  But of course, the MSM did not report on that.
[00:40:02.339 --> 00:40:05.300]  They spun fake news that Trump had a small turnout.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:06.341]  Number 6!
[00:40:07.864 --> 00:40:10.166]  Donald Trump is a racist.
[00:40:10.727 --> 00:40:22.217]  We've all heard this fake news soundbite time and time again by SJWs and anti-fascists and they claim this but it's just simply not true and here's why.
[00:40:22.998 --> 00:40:33.046]  Liberals might ask, but isn't it racist to say that illegal Mexicans come here and they commit crimes and they commit rapes?
[00:40:33.406 --> 00:40:36.868]  Or isn't it racist to say that we should have a temporary ban on Muslims?
[00:40:37.329 --> 00:40:41.392]  No, it's not racist because Mexico is not a race.
[00:40:42.152 --> 00:40:44.494]  And Muslim is not a race.
[00:40:44.934 --> 00:40:49.017]  These are these are a religion and it's a nation, a nation of people.
[00:40:49.057 --> 00:40:51.098]  So to say he's racist just is not true.
[00:40:51.518 --> 00:40:57.362]  Not to mention the fact that Donald Trump has actually advocated for minorities.
[00:40:58.103 --> 00:41:11.332]  Donald Trump actually sued Palm Beach, Florida over discrimination, saying that they were discriminating against his golf resort because of the fact that he was allowing in Jewish and black
[00:41:11.892 --> 00:41:12.273]  Number 5!
[00:41:21.431 --> 00:41:42.794]  PPGate, yes, this viral fake news episode, which many of us have all heard about, was spawned by BuzzFeed and then, you know, further perpetuated by CNN when they actually were making these claims by leaked memos that Donald Trump was being blackmailed by the Russians over
[00:41:43.394 --> 00:41:45.054]  A PPgate scandal.
[00:41:45.094 --> 00:41:56.337]  I mean, they actually claimed that Donald Trump hired Russian prostitutes to urinate in front of him on a bed in a hotel in Russia that once the Obama stayed at.
[00:41:56.397 --> 00:42:01.358]  And this was so, you know, it was a way to say that Donald Trump is being controlled by the Russians.
[00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:02.418]  See, we have it.
[00:42:02.558 --> 00:42:04.519]  And to try and ridicule and embarrass him.
[00:42:05.019 --> 00:42:07.439]  But in fact, it was fake news.
[00:42:07.499 --> 00:42:10.040]  I can't believe they actually ran it in the first place.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.561]  And, well, you know, how did it happen?
[00:42:12.601 --> 00:42:13.561]  That's the real question.
[00:42:13.601 --> 00:42:27.708]  Well, apparently 4chan had leaked this out to a man named Rick Wilson, a big never-Trumper, who then he leaked it to his leftist friends and buddies at the CIA and the CIA ran off with it.
[00:42:27.748 --> 00:42:32.370]  Next thing you know, you know, Obama and President Trump are being briefed on it.
[00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:37.912]  It got leaked out and it just went out from there, folks, and it was absolute
[00:42:38.152 --> 00:42:38.873]  Fake news.
[00:42:38.973 --> 00:42:43.296]  Basically, the mainstream media and the CIA got completely trolled.
[00:42:43.316 --> 00:42:44.277]  Number four!
[00:42:45.842 --> 00:42:50.763]  Trump didn't stand a chance at winning the 2016 presidential race.
[00:42:51.083 --> 00:42:51.963]  We all heard it.
[00:42:52.343 --> 00:42:55.444]  The mainstream media tried to have everyone fooled.
[00:42:55.644 --> 00:42:58.664]  And then, sure enough, absolute shock.
[00:42:58.904 --> 00:43:11.847]  And it was absolutely hilarious to watch these MSM pundits totally freak out when they found out that, in fact, Donald Trump was going to be the 45th president of the United States.
[00:43:11.927 --> 00:43:12.927]  I mean, they just
[00:43:13.567 --> 00:43:14.648]  Could not handle it.
[00:43:14.688 --> 00:43:18.072]  Probably one of the biggest fake news fails of all time.
[00:43:21.977 --> 00:43:29.346]  We've all heard this one time and time again, and it is completely false.
[00:43:29.726 --> 00:43:32.029]  And I'm going to be breaking down why it is false.
[00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:38.872]  The election results and electronic voting machines weren't hacked or tampered with by hackers.
[00:43:39.352 --> 00:43:44.833]  What was hacked was the DNC, the Democratic National Committee's emails.
[00:43:45.253 --> 00:43:48.014]  That's what was hacked, not the election results.
[00:43:48.074 --> 00:43:55.876]  And they put this out and it gave people the false impression that the election results were tampered with when in fact it was the DNC's emails that were hacked by somebody.
[00:43:56.136 --> 00:43:57.437]  We don't know who it was.
[00:43:57.677 --> 00:44:01.158]  The Russians have denied a role in the hacks and we don't actually have
[00:44:01.778 --> 00:44:06.302]  Concrete evidence that the Russians actually did hack the DNC emails.
[00:44:06.862 --> 00:44:08.023]  Number two.
[00:44:08.884 --> 00:44:13.948]  Comparing Kushner and Ivanka to Uday and Qusay Hussein.
[00:44:14.509 --> 00:44:17.231]  This one is actually unbelievable.
[00:44:17.491 --> 00:44:24.177]  MSNBC actually was trying to compare Ivanka Trump and her husband
[00:44:24.637 --> 00:44:27.378]  To Saddam Hussein's children.
[00:44:27.458 --> 00:44:28.159]  That's right.
[00:44:28.199 --> 00:44:34.982]  They were trying to make it seem as though Ivanka and her husband are intimidating and that people should be fearful of them.
[00:44:35.362 --> 00:44:41.945]  Uday and Qusay Hussein in the past have actually executed people just for looking at them the wrong way.
[00:44:42.385 --> 00:44:43.806]  So this is just an attempt to
[00:44:44.326 --> 00:44:56.000]  Make people perceive the Trump family as something that's intimidating and that's scary and that's like a malevolent dictatorship when it's just it's frankly not true and it's outright ridiculous.
[00:44:59.904 --> 00:45:00.444]  We're good to go.
[00:45:18.234 --> 00:45:39.042]  Then, Representative Núñez, during the Congressional House Intelligence Committee hearing, he actually said that some of the communications of the Trump transition team, and possibly Trump himself, were monitored after the election as part of an incidental collection.
[00:45:39.522 --> 00:45:46.087]  Well, we all know how they like to use their spying software and incidentally collect information.
[00:45:46.127 --> 00:45:55.734]  Just how they're collecting millions and billions of data on Americans as we speak right now, according to their incidental data collections.
[00:45:55.814 --> 00:46:00.598]  And we've seen other leaks happening at the same time, which is completely unacceptable.
[00:46:01.118 --> 00:46:04.220]  So it just goes to show, you know, there's tons of fake news out there.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:09.083]  They just want to keep on spreading this fake news, these lies against Donald Trump.
[00:46:09.404 --> 00:46:12.786]  I mean, I can't believe how many fake news lies there are.
[00:46:12.846 --> 00:46:17.069]  It was not easy to pick through all these different stories because, let me tell you folks,
[00:46:17.529 --> 00:46:38.297]  There are tons of fake news articles out there where they're just trying to smear President Trump and do anything they can to try and twist the truth so that they can get the American people to rethink or maybe even back away from supporting somebody who actually is going to have their interests at heart and do what he can.
[00:46:38.437 --> 00:46:40.458]  So, you know, this has been great, guys.
[00:46:40.538 --> 00:46:43.519]  I will be keeping you guys updated on more fake news.
[00:46:44.059 --> 00:46:50.885]  This is Millie Weaver and you guys are watching the tip of the spear, the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.740]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.412]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.473]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.793 --> 00:48:50.513]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.554 --> 00:48:51.154]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.514 --> 00:48:59.058]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.078 --> 00:49:01.419]  We can answer your questions.
[00:49:01.439 --> 00:49:01.719]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:13.886]  On Sunday, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told the Daily News that he will let the fearless girl statue remain in place for the next year, proving that women can achieve great things if a man allows it.
[00:49:14.838 --> 00:49:21.062]  The statue was installed in March of this year, a stark and challenging contrast to the charging bull statue that's long been the symbol of Wall Street.
[00:49:21.503 --> 00:49:26.746]  The defiant little girl quickly became a sensation, and perhaps unwittingly, the perfect symbol for modern feminism.
[00:49:27.186 --> 00:49:34.992]  For while the bull represents America's animalistic power, the force and energy of an untamed free market, the physical embodiment of American prosperity,
[00:49:35.732 --> 00:49:40.217]  It's now being challenged and defied by a self-important little girl who insists on being the center of attention.
[00:49:40.237 --> 00:49:53.591]  I don't want to sound like a misogynist, but I can't help but think that if a man had been involved in the statue's creation, he could have used his naturally superior reasoning and spatial awareness to suggest that the fearless girl be installed perhaps riding on top of the bull or leading the bull in a charge.
[00:49:53.951 --> 00:49:57.895]  You know, contributing to American prosperity rather than standing in opposition to it.
[00:49:58.636 --> 00:50:03.619]  But I digress, because whatever its symbolism, the installation depicting an imminent mauling is here to stay.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.101]  And it's inspiring women all over New York.
[00:50:06.501 --> 00:50:09.923]  Not to create statues of their own, of course, but to insist that others do it for them.
[00:50:10.404 --> 00:50:15.727]  According to the New York Post, quote, Because why do something yourself when you can just demand the city do it for you?
[00:50:15.787 --> 00:50:18.008]  Women don't see themselves represented in the streets of New York!
[00:50:25.373 --> 00:50:27.360]  Said Manhattan Borough President Gail Brewer.
[00:50:27.762 --> 00:50:31.375]  We have sculptures and art of a lot of men and that needs to change!
[00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:37.311]  Well, I agree with Miss Brewer, and I say it's a crying shame that there are no prominent statues of women in New York.
[00:50:37.711 --> 00:50:43.512]  There's no iconic statue in the city, no enduring symbol of the city itself, as well as America as a whole.
[00:50:43.812 --> 00:50:48.273]  There's nothing that can be called the most famous, recognizable, and well-loved monument in the world.
[00:50:48.353 --> 00:50:50.914]  No masterpiece of artistry and engineering.
[00:50:50.934 --> 00:50:58.135]  A humble and stoic goddess, crafted in epic proportions, meant to not just embody our most highly cherished virtues,
[00:50:58.615 --> 00:51:00.156]  But to declare them to the world.
[00:51:00.556 --> 00:51:06.340]  An angel that bears that luminous flame we call liberty, equality, and justice.
[00:51:07.561 --> 00:51:09.242]  I really think the city could use something like that.
[00:51:10.242 --> 00:51:11.203]  But only if it's a girl.
[00:51:11.563 --> 00:51:12.524]  That's the important part.
[00:51:13.645 --> 00:51:15.866]  This has been Harrison Smith for InfoWars.com.
[00:51:16.647 --> 00:51:20.289]  Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.
[00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:21.209]  No dudes.
[00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:22.170]  Chicks rule.
[00:51:30.643 --> 00:51:36.166]  Hey, I just checked and modern art is still a pretentious, meaningless, nihilistic shitshow.
[00:51:36.286 --> 00:51:43.789]  MoMA, the museum of modern art, inadvertently exposed the sheer worthlessness of most modern art when they tweeted this.
[00:51:43.949 --> 00:51:47.531]  Despite almost breaking this out of our collection, MoMA will be open during regular hours today.
[00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:58.094]  So they're basically making a tongue-in-cheek joke that this piece of art, a commercially available foil blanket, would have come in handy during the recent snowstorm in New York.
[00:51:58.174 --> 00:52:03.375]  Yes, that's an actual piece of art on display in the Museum of Modern Art.
[00:52:03.395 --> 00:52:12.037]  There's also this masterpiece made by the same artist, a scrunched-up Blizzard survival bag made by the same company.
[00:52:12.077 --> 00:52:16.458]  The artist, Derek Ryden, was so pleased with his scrunched-up bag
[00:52:16.778 --> 00:52:20.700]  Created in 1998, that the foil blanket followed in 2001.
[00:52:21.441 --> 00:52:33.609]  Given the obviously monumental forethought and the painstaking skill and intricacy required to buy a couple of foil blankets, open one, leave the other unopened, take a picture of it...
[00:52:34.469 --> 00:52:35.549]  And then call it art.
[00:52:35.709 --> 00:52:42.231]  I'm sure you can understand why it took him three years to conceive of and create this magnum opus.
[00:52:42.431 --> 00:52:44.872]  But go back and read that MoMA tweet.
[00:52:45.112 --> 00:52:48.113]  They're basically acknowledging that this is not art.
[00:52:48.273 --> 00:52:53.935]  You wouldn't consider ripping down the Bayeux tapestry and using it to protect yourself from bad weather.
[00:52:53.995 --> 00:52:57.296]  Because that has actual significance and value.
[00:52:57.476 --> 00:52:58.816]  That's real art.
[00:52:58.956 --> 00:53:04.098]  A tinfoil blanket doesn't have significance or value beyond the one dollar
[00:53:04.478 --> 00:53:15.346]  And to think, MoMA demolished the American Folk Museum, a building that contained actual art to make way for more of this garbage.
[00:53:15.426 --> 00:53:17.048]  What about this piece of crap?
[00:53:17.348 --> 00:53:19.890]  Looks like something I'd use to insulate my roof.
[00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.590]  No.
[00:53:21.191 --> 00:53:23.053]  It's hashtag beautiful!
[00:53:23.153 --> 00:53:25.996]  Want to use these ugly tiles for your kitchen floor?
[00:53:26.256 --> 00:53:26.657]  That'll be $250,000.
[00:53:28.118 --> 00:53:31.722]  Some nails hammered into a piece of burlap.
[00:53:31.802 --> 00:53:34.044]  That just sold for over $700,000.
[00:53:35.325 --> 00:53:37.728]  Look at the length of the description.
[00:53:37.808 --> 00:53:38.348]  Look at this.
[00:53:38.449 --> 00:53:39.389]  Rudolph Stingle.
[00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:40.411]  Untitled.
[00:53:40.531 --> 00:53:41.792]  Listen to the description.
[00:53:41.852 --> 00:53:47.138]  The majesty of hieroglyphs is suffused with a sense of greater substance than the sum of their parts.
[00:53:47.258 --> 00:53:56.128]  The resulting panels of stark bright silver were transformed through a collaboration with the audience in a series of uncontrolled impulsive marks and messages carved into the surface.
[00:53:56.248 --> 00:53:56.829]  In other words...
[00:53:56.989 --> 00:54:04.595]  He stuck a piece of aluminum foil to a board and asked some random people to scrawl cack-handed graffiti into it.
[00:54:04.655 --> 00:54:06.957]  That'll be a quarter of a million dollars, please!
[00:54:07.117 --> 00:54:13.262]  Oh yeah, and all that guff they write about it to disguise the fact that it's just a piece of foil stuck to a board.
[00:54:13.342 --> 00:54:15.364]  That's called obscurantism.
[00:54:15.424 --> 00:54:24.071]  It's a fancy way of confusing people so their initial discernment is temporarily suspended, making them afraid of criticizing such art
[00:54:24.611 --> 00:54:28.094]  For fear of appearing uncultured or ignorant.
[00:54:28.254 --> 00:54:33.598]  When in reality, their first instinct that it was total bulls**t is correct.
[00:54:34.239 --> 00:54:37.682]  It is total bulls**t. Just like most modern art.
[00:54:37.802 --> 00:54:50.252]  If a couple of teenage kids can fool visitors to a gallery in San Francisco into thinking that a pair of glasses they placed on the floor was part of the exhibition, then there are no standards whatsoever.
[00:54:50.552 --> 00:54:58.535]  I mean, can I just pick up a guitar and start playing made-up out-of-tune chords while warbling incoherently and expect to have a number one hit?
[00:54:58.755 --> 00:55:01.175]  Ever thrown a waste paper at a bin and missed?
[00:55:01.475 --> 00:55:02.256]  That's art.
[00:55:02.556 --> 00:55:04.136]  Ever stepped on a tin can?
[00:55:04.456 --> 00:55:05.277]  That's art.
[00:55:05.397 --> 00:55:07.597]  Congealed dried noodles sprayed gold.
[00:55:07.857 --> 00:55:10.258]  And how dare you suggest that that's not art?
[00:55:10.498 --> 00:55:14.700]  After all, someone stuck it in a glass box, so it must be, right?
[00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:18.781]  A man, lying on a mattress, screaming for two and a half hours.
[00:55:25.578 --> 00:55:29.200]  The wooden figurine was made by someone else, and that's not art.
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:33.062]  But Ken Kagami stuck a foam c*** and balls through it.
[00:55:33.642 --> 00:55:34.463]  Now it's art.
[00:55:34.563 --> 00:55:36.364]  And then there's this classic.
[00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:56.165]  Deep down, these people must know they're pulling off a monumental scam, right?
[00:55:56.225 --> 00:56:00.088]  I mean, Damien Hirst literally wrote Incinerate Me on this.
[00:56:00.468 --> 00:56:01.349]  Whatever it is.
[00:56:01.469 --> 00:56:02.830]  Is he taking the piss?
[00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:04.731]  Well, probably not.
[00:56:04.831 --> 00:56:11.556]  As Sohrab Amari discusses in his excellent book The New Philistines, people have always railed against bad art.
[00:56:11.877 --> 00:56:16.941]  But what's happened to the art world in the last few decades is immeasurably worse.
[00:56:17.061 --> 00:56:19.783]  Because in trying to break the final taboo,
[00:56:20.183 --> 00:56:23.924]  The art world decided that it no longer had to be aesthetically pleasing.
[00:56:24.144 --> 00:56:27.705]  Art no longer had to reflect sincerity or the human spirit.
[00:56:27.845 --> 00:56:33.146]  It no longer had to require actual skill, talent, or hard work to create it.
[00:56:33.226 --> 00:56:34.806]  They changed the rules.
[00:56:34.946 --> 00:56:49.109]  And now, no matter how lazy, pathetic, worthless, ugly, or meaningless a piece of art is, so long as it's been filtered through the lens of social justice and identity politics, then it can be considered art.
[00:56:49.289 --> 00:57:00.311]  So long as it's banal conceptualisation can claim to address some imaginary injustice, be it colonialism, racism, misogyny, or whatever, it's celebrated.
[00:57:00.351 --> 00:57:04.112]  But there are some who simply can't take this sort of art seriously.
[00:57:04.132 --> 00:57:10.933]  I think it should be called the Junk Shop Prize, because if you put all this lot in a junk shop, you wouldn't notice any difference.
[00:57:11.353 --> 00:57:13.934]  But it's conceptual art, some might say you're missing the point.
[00:57:14.585 --> 00:57:18.328]  Well, the point of conceptual art is it's meant to have profound thinking behind it.
[00:57:19.168 --> 00:57:23.452]  If you think there's any profound thinking behind this, I think you're missing the point yourself.
[00:57:23.612 --> 00:57:30.597]  Ultimately, this is about the politicised abuse of art to advance and ingrain far-left narratives.
[00:57:30.797 --> 00:57:46.284]  Just as communist dictators used socialist realism as a political tool to thwart police control and manipulate public opinion, the regressive left uses modern art, and by extension popular culture, as a weapon of indoctrination.
[00:57:46.344 --> 00:58:00.150]  And just like the communists used workers and farmers as political props to further their own power, the regressive left utilises gays, transgenders, muslims and other minorities as human shields for their agenda.
[00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:08.556]  These avant-garde social justice artists like to think of themselves as dissidents fighting against the repressive mainstream.
[00:58:08.596 --> 00:58:16.621]  That's why they're obsessed with tearing down the supposed establishment, the patriarchy, white male privilege or capitalism.
[00:58:16.701 --> 00:58:30.138]  While the Saatchi Gallery, the Turner Prize and Tate Modern are simultaneously sponsored by giant corporations, they're also rebelling against the very idea itself that art should be beautiful.
[00:58:30.238 --> 00:58:31.760]  If people say it's art, it's art.
[00:58:32.849 --> 00:58:34.911]  Well, I think that's absolute rubbish.
[00:58:34.971 --> 00:58:36.132]  So you could say anything is art?
[00:58:36.612 --> 00:58:38.313]  You could say everything is art.
[00:58:38.853 --> 00:58:41.075]  But the point is that... Is my shoe art?
[00:58:41.816 --> 00:58:44.537]  If you say it is, I have to then judge it on those terms.
[00:58:44.638 --> 00:58:46.859]  I think that's a totally ridiculous argument.
