[00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.110]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:14.232]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:23.813]  We are in the midst of two different countervailing revolutions.
[00:00:23.813 --> 00:00:33.655]  We have the pro-human, common sense, truly liberal, Renaissance trajectory, based on a Judeo-Christian ethos,
[00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:53.436]  But integrated with modern science, then we have the globalist centralization paradigm that openly seeks to overthrow the natural order and program it in whatever shapes, sizes, and ways the new gods see fit.
[00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:55.857]  There is renaissance and there is authoritarianism.
[00:00:56.667 --> 00:01:01.672]  Authoritarianism sells its poison Kool-Aid in a thousand flavors.
[00:01:01.672 --> 00:01:03.854]  But all of it will enslave you.
[00:01:03.854 --> 00:01:05.935]  All of it will destroy your dreams.
[00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:13.202]  All of it will lead you straight into hell and bondage.
[00:01:13.202 --> 00:01:14.103]  Ladies and gentlemen...
[00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:27.229]  In the last month, you've seen huge attack pieces in hundreds of newspapers, national television, misrepresenting what I've said and what I've covered here on this broadcast.
[00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.434]  Saying Alex Jones hates gay people, Alex Jones hates drag queens.
[00:01:31.434 --> 00:01:31.714]  Listen!
[00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:34.296]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:01:34.296 --> 00:01:38.218]  I believe in conservative values for families because statistically that's successful.
[00:01:38.218 --> 00:01:47.183]  And I believe people should be able to choose their sexuality and who they want to be and not be sexualized by a heterosexual uncle or a homosexual aunt or anybody.
[00:01:47.183 --> 00:01:49.284]  Keep your hands off children.
[00:01:49.284 --> 00:01:51.205]  Period.
[00:01:51.205 --> 00:01:56.808]  And the targeting of children by the Tavistock Institute, that's MI6 mind control, publicly.
[00:01:58.063 --> 00:01:59.204]  That's public.
[00:01:59.204 --> 00:02:01.405]  British mind control operation.
[00:02:01.405 --> 00:02:07.189]  To have children as young as three sign up for gender reassignment, confusing them.
[00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:13.653]  And Camille Paglia, that has been a classical liberal lesbian, says it's serious child abuse.
[00:02:13.653 --> 00:02:14.554]  Because it is.
[00:02:16.408 --> 00:02:31.235]  But then the media tries to hide behind their agenda of breaking up the family, dehumanization by chemicals, by cultural brainwashing, by anti-father figure images all throughout the media and all the other attacks.
[00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:37.998]  They want to change the subject whenever I expose the sexualization of children and say, oh, you're just against drag queens.
[00:02:37.998 --> 00:02:42.700]  No, I was against government programs in every European and Western country, including the U.S.
[00:02:44.048 --> 00:02:53.256]  Sending two, three, and four year olds to story time where men, sometimes dressed up like clowns, tell them, want to be a drag queen?
[00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:54.517]  Want to be a girl if you're a boy?
[00:02:54.517 --> 00:02:57.279]  Want to be a girl if you're a boy?
[00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:58.500]  Or a boy if you're a girl?
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.506]  That is pure sexualization of children in the name of tolerance, targeting them.
[00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:11.371]  And there are major professors, major professors, that
[00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:23.646]  are being banned from YouTube and banned from grants because they say there are male chromosomes, there are female chromosomes, there are males, there are females, and that's the new ultimate crime.
[00:03:23.646 --> 00:03:32.890]  We were contacted by Facebook last week and told you're going to be permanently banned if you don't stop talking about this.
[00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.893]  Chemicals in the water, sexualization of children, they said there's words you cannot say.
[00:03:41.343 --> 00:03:43.004]  You cannot say drag queen.
[00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:44.044]  You cannot say tranny.
[00:03:44.044 --> 00:03:47.185]  And I'm like, that's weird.
[00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:50.767]  Until I realized they can use that term.
[00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:52.908]  They can push that agenda on kids.
[00:03:52.908 --> 00:04:03.192]  We can't even be allowed in the matrix to communicate the term to explain the agenda using the quote, drag queens.
[00:04:03.192 --> 00:04:06.733]  Imagine if a woman came in and wanted to randomly talk to your children about sex.
[00:04:06.733 --> 00:04:08.094]  You'd say it was bizarre.
[00:04:08.094 --> 00:04:09.635]  There was a school nurse and they were too young.
[00:04:09.635 --> 00:04:10.255]  You'd think it was weird.
[00:04:11.308 --> 00:04:12.329]  What if it was a man?
[00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.834]  I mean, if Judge Roy Moore was really courting 14 year olds, I think it's creepy.
[00:04:16.834 --> 00:04:18.035]  I don't like it.
[00:04:18.035 --> 00:04:18.996]  But it might not be true.
[00:04:18.996 --> 00:04:20.397]  He's denying it all.
[00:04:20.397 --> 00:04:21.979]  See what I mean?
[00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.964]  If Judge Roy Moore's 35 courting 14 year old girls, it's weird.
[00:04:26.964 --> 00:04:27.885]  But when you've got...
[00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:35.802]  The footage that Millie Weaver and Gavin Winscott in Austin at a public thing, they were videotaping it, they streamed it online, took photos, all the kids.
[00:04:35.802 --> 00:04:38.544]  It's on Infowars.com, the shock video.
[00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:52.570]  They have got men twerking and pole dancing with little kids and men wearing thong underwear with children dressed like, I mean it is shocking sexualization of children.
[00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.191]  It is incredible and it's all coming up.

[00:05:38.757 --> 00:05:40.658]  DNA Force and Bomb Defense.
[00:05:40.658 --> 00:05:41.179]  Probiotic.
[00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:42.039]  Now back in stock.
[00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.200]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.042]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:47.782]  It is an act of war.
[00:05:47.782 --> 00:05:50.224]  It is an act of standing up.
[00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:55.787]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[00:05:59.648 --> 00:06:00.909]  You've got it.
[00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:06.734]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:11.077]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:11.077 --> 00:06:13.099]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.342]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:21.305]  Are we seeing the earth?
[00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:23.066]  You've got it.
[00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:26.349]  Are we seeing the earth?
[00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.711]  You've got it.
[00:06:33.692 --> 00:06:34.074]  Yeah.
[00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:13.002]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up at the bottom of the hour, we're going to premiere, if you can use that term, shocking footage shot inside a quote, drag queen festival held at a hotel in Austin, Texas.
[00:07:13.002 --> 00:07:22.428]  And if you think it's creepy when you see these fashion shows and little girls and little boys dressed up in adult clothing,
[00:07:24.864 --> 00:07:32.449]  I guess they think it's politically correct, it's okay to have young children next to men with huge cod pieces.
[00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:34.651]  Scroll down and show them.
[00:07:34.651 --> 00:07:38.593]  Basically naked, just with glitter on the man's genitals.
[00:07:38.593 --> 00:07:49.721]  Little girls, little boys, men humping the ground, twerking, children simulating it with women in hijabs, just all trying to be counterculture.
[00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:51.242]  It can't get any weirder.
[00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:53.944]  Total sexualization of children.
[00:07:57.159 --> 00:08:22.516]  We're talking about women and men bringing their children to a drag queen festival that looks like a gay parade, which have your parades all day, but everybody's pointed out it's something you don't bring your children to.
[00:08:22.516 --> 00:08:25.918]  So that's the next level, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:29.298 --> 00:08:41.802]  That's the next level of this coming up with Millie Weaver in studio at the bottom of the hour.
[00:08:41.802 --> 00:08:54.427]  And it is a total agenda all over the country and all over the Western world and it's weirder than hell because they will also at these events have Muslim Democratic Party leader women wearing hijabs
[00:08:57.073 --> 00:09:07.576]  Who then have family members that are known jihadists, that write books about not letting women go out without a man, don't let women drive cars, and cut women's genitals off.
[00:09:07.576 --> 00:09:10.877]  And throw gay people off buildings.
[00:09:10.877 --> 00:09:15.798]  So, under the guise of tolerance, they're promoting the sexualization of children.
[00:09:15.798 --> 00:09:22.460]  And we're gonna premiere the footage, then we're gonna post it, it's not posted yet, at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:28.004 --> 00:09:31.105]  Now we've got so much other over-the-top important news.
[00:09:31.105 --> 00:09:40.970]  Saudi Arabia scrambles fighter jets amid fears of war in the Middle East.
[00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.250]  That is escalating.
[00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:51.234]  Judge Roy Moore says he will sue the Washington Post and others over what he says are complete and total lies.
[00:09:51.234 --> 00:09:57.237]  Well, I don't know if Judge Roy Moore was trying to sexualize 14-year-olds, but we got footage
[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:21.705]  at events all over the world including Austin, Texas this weekend where it's men bent over humping like they're having sex with kids simulating it right next to them with women wearing hijabs clapping and then big old fat men with wigs on pole dancing and little kids there just in the midst of clearly
[00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:31.734]  The early sexualization of children and the fetishizing of involving children in it, it is truly sick.
[00:10:31.734 --> 00:10:34.615]  And our crew gets there and, okay, videotape.
[00:10:34.615 --> 00:10:35.455]  Oh yeah, sure.
[00:10:35.455 --> 00:10:40.837]  Yeah, we're streaming live on the internet.
[00:10:40.837 --> 00:10:44.458]  Yeah, we've got Facebook showing it all and little kids giving tips.
[00:10:45.677 --> 00:10:49.558]  Giving money to the drag queens that dance for them.
[00:10:49.558 --> 00:10:50.939]  In fact, I should open the show up.
[00:10:50.939 --> 00:10:58.161]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have video of fat men pole dancing and little kids, little girls and little boys giving them dollars.
[00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:09.145]  Imagine you go to the local park and there's a guy on the monkey bars in a woman's dress, wearing a g-string with his package with glitter on it, leaning over and then your children are giving them dollars.
[00:11:10.495 --> 00:11:12.095]  You would call the police.
[00:11:12.095 --> 00:11:13.176]  You would go insane.
[00:11:13.176 --> 00:11:15.096]  No one would believe you.
[00:11:15.096 --> 00:11:20.678]  It would be so weird.
[00:11:20.678 --> 00:11:22.358]  No one would believe you.
[00:11:22.358 --> 00:11:27.359]  It would be so weird.
[00:11:27.359 --> 00:11:32.901]  Notice the left tried to destroy Ted Cruz because there's a Republican once and there was some other Republican.
[00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:38.082]  They went to a burlesque show that was just women scantily dressed but covered up.
[00:11:39.189 --> 00:11:41.371]  Pretty classy in my view.
[00:11:41.371 --> 00:11:47.137]  Imagine if Ted Cruz went to one with transsexuals.
[00:11:47.137 --> 00:11:49.220]  We've been told.
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.323]  Facebook officially said that's a hate word, even though it was never thought to be a hate word before.
[00:11:52.323 --> 00:11:54.645]  So we can't even use the word that they've banned.
[00:11:54.645 --> 00:12:00.732]  Again, it's all about the control of language, so you can't even criticize something that's then attached itself to
[00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:10.853]  The overall larger agenda.
[00:12:10.853 --> 00:12:13.375]  Sparkle shine at story time.
[00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:13.635]  St.
[00:12:13.635 --> 00:12:22.280]  Louis Post-Dispatch.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:32.847]  And then what it is, is a bunch of little kids being rolled up in front of a bunch of men dressed like women, scantily clad, and being taught, this is cool, this is fun, this is neat.
[00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:35.872]  That's just a newspaper article you brought in to show me.
[00:12:35.872 --> 00:12:46.325]  This is happening in every major city, every week, that children are being bombarded.
[00:12:46.325 --> 00:12:48.628]  And then people say, oh, you're just being mean.
[00:12:50.325 --> 00:12:54.387]  You're just attacking them because they're cross-dressers.
[00:12:54.387 --> 00:12:57.188]  No, ladies and gentlemen, I don't care about that.
[00:12:57.188 --> 00:13:00.609]  I don't care if they were heterosexuals, cross-dressers, whatever they are.
[00:13:00.609 --> 00:13:06.892]  They shouldn't be in there bombarding in an organized program saying, the drag queen goes swish, swish, swish.
[00:13:06.892 --> 00:13:09.113]  You're all going to be drag queens when you grow up.
[00:13:09.113 --> 00:13:13.395]  You don't have a scientist or a firefighter or a police officer coming to say you're going to be that.
[00:13:13.655 --> 00:13:14.635]  No, no, no.
[00:13:14.635 --> 00:13:16.336]  We're going to teach you how to be a drag queen.
[00:13:16.336 --> 00:13:18.997]  I mean, it's on the audio from the AP piece.
[00:13:18.997 --> 00:13:26.819]  And the media always plays dumb and says they don't want the alarm bell raised that we're making this up and just attacking drag queens.
[00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:28.980]  I mean, I will say these are hideously ugly men.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:36.202]  If they're going to be drag queens, my God, could they just get some that don't look like, look like hell?
[00:13:36.202 --> 00:13:42.124]  I mean, I'm allowed to aesthetically say these are really obese people.
[00:13:43.001 --> 00:13:45.643]  But again, it's the force feeding of it onto our children.
[00:13:45.643 --> 00:13:48.445]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:13:48.445 --> 00:13:55.549]  But when we come back in a few minutes, every few months I see a stabbing attack at the Mall of America by a Somali.
[00:13:55.549 --> 00:13:59.792]  And then you always see the police chief say, we love our Somalis.
[00:13:59.792 --> 00:14:01.493]  We love our Muslims too.
[00:14:01.493 --> 00:14:02.193]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:14:02.193 --> 00:14:03.154]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:14:03.154 --> 00:14:04.935]  That was actually a quote I saw a few years ago.
[00:14:04.935 --> 00:14:08.157]  And then they made a song out of it on Super Deluxe.
[00:14:08.157 --> 00:14:10.219]  It's been seen like 40 million times plus.
[00:14:11.186 --> 00:14:14.449]  It's one of the most popular songs this year.
[00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:17.752]  Kind of blew up in their face when they made folks love us, not hate us.
[00:14:17.752 --> 00:14:21.295]  Well, there's been another stabbing at the Mall of America by Somali.
[00:14:21.295 --> 00:14:22.796]  Stabbed two people, they say, for no reason.
[00:14:22.796 --> 00:14:28.682]  And we're going to come back and show you actual footage of the Mall of America, what it looked like when the stabbing.
[00:14:28.682 --> 00:14:34.987]  This is during the stabbing, this footage.
[00:14:34.987 --> 00:14:36.769]  And the mall is basically 90% Somali now.
[00:14:38.717 --> 00:14:48.805]  That is a government resettlement zone for 40 years, and then the Somalis do not, on average, assimilate.
[00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:56.512]  No, they just recreate Somalia right here.
[00:14:56.512 --> 00:15:00.295]  So, we love our Somalis.
[00:15:00.295 --> 00:15:02.657]  We love our Muslims too.
[00:15:02.657 --> 00:15:04.599]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:15:04.599 --> 00:15:06.040]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:15:09.147 --> 00:15:11.830]  And it just shows where we've gone as a culture and a civilization.
[00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:19.860]  Briefly, we are having to end the specials that we had on a bunch of products because they basically sold out.
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.105]  A bunch of the products sold out.
[00:15:23.105 --> 00:15:27.790]  We're having to end the specials on Supernova Vitality and others, but we're extending free shipping.
[00:15:28.993 --> 00:15:31.974]  And we've added some new items, but only for two more days.
[00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:33.975]  We've added some new items back on.
[00:15:33.975 --> 00:15:37.016]  Z-Shield is 50% off the Great Detoxifier.
[00:15:37.016 --> 00:15:39.877]  And Caveman True Paleo is about to sell out.
[00:15:39.877 --> 00:15:41.618]  But a new shipment comes in, in two weeks.
[00:15:41.618 --> 00:15:45.399]  But I'm gonna go ahead and put it at 50% off, with free shipping on top of it.

[00:19:38.021 --> 00:19:40.183]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:17.557 --> 00:20:31.788]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:31.788 --> 00:20:33.109]  So if you're a radio listener,
[00:20:34.372 --> 00:20:48.004]  You probably know that we also simulcast via television on some cable systems and UHF stations as well as streams on the internet so we can document what we're saying, not just make claims.
[00:20:48.004 --> 00:20:49.305]  That's why I pioneered
[00:20:50.868 --> 00:21:04.231]  Really about 19 years ago, simulcasting video with my radio show, not just a webcam, so I could show people news articles, show people documents, show people bills, show people legislation.
[00:21:04.231 --> 00:21:13.514]  That was really back in the day before the internet was so prolific where you could just go search any bill or find any piece of news you wanted and then folks would just say I was making it up.
[00:21:15.148 --> 00:21:16.449]  So I began to show people.
[00:21:16.449 --> 00:21:17.810]  Well, that's what we do.
[00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:25.354]  But if you are a radio listener, if you go to Infowars.com forward slash show, you can actually see what I'm talking about.
[00:21:25.354 --> 00:21:31.258]  Mall of America yesterday was about 95% Somali.
[00:21:31.258 --> 00:21:35.781]  Now, that's the main area where they've been resettling for 40 plus years.
[00:21:35.781 --> 00:21:36.361]  The U.S.
[00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:37.962]  government has been bringing
[00:21:38.996 --> 00:21:47.940]  Muslims in, from the most suppressive, most radical Muslim nation in the world, where women are sold at slave auctions to this day.
[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:55.823]  And it has the highest murder rate in the world, and women are seen as basically animals.
[00:21:55.823 --> 00:22:05.027]  Now, our government, as part of the Diversity Visa Program, has colonized Minnesota with Somalis.
[00:22:06.454 --> 00:22:13.399]  And every few days I hear about a Somali stabbing someone, or running over someone, or shooting someone.
[00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:17.002]  Sometimes the police officers in Minnesota, they're Somali, just randomly shoot people.
[00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:19.083]  That's been in the news.
[00:22:19.083 --> 00:22:20.945]  And it's, I guess, the culture.
[00:22:20.945 --> 00:22:24.967]  You could say everybody knows about Somalia and the pirates and all the rest of it.
[00:22:24.967 --> 00:22:25.868]  So this is being done.
[00:22:25.868 --> 00:22:28.470]  They're being brought into the country.
[00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:35.155]  And then, every time there's a new attack, it just gets shuffled under the rug.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:43.263]  What's really going on, but here's the attack.
[00:22:43.263 --> 00:22:47.645]  Suspect arrested after stabbing at Mall of America.
[00:22:47.645 --> 00:22:50.626]  And then Time Magazine, Newsweek and others have headlines.
[00:22:50.626 --> 00:23:01.892]  Oh look, Somalis finding their way in America and it shows them at the swimming pool wearing their hijabs, their full, full outfits in the pool.
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.022]  And then again, this isn't backwards, this isn't suppressive of women.
[00:23:07.022 --> 00:23:10.825]  No, no, the left says this is good!
[00:23:10.825 --> 00:23:15.028]  This is great!
[00:23:15.028 --> 00:23:25.536]  And then if you go to a drag queen festival, you'll see five-year-old kids holding hands with men who are wearing nothing but glitter glued to their genitals.
[00:23:25.536 --> 00:23:31.020]  But see, now a little girl, a little boy with a man with glitter on his genitals, it's okay because it's liberal.
[00:23:31.826 --> 00:23:33.687]  It's not sexualization of children.
[00:23:33.687 --> 00:23:34.928]  It's not conditioning everybody.
[00:23:34.928 --> 00:23:37.130]  It's not an organized program, which it is.
[00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.091]  It's just peace and love!
[00:23:39.091 --> 00:23:46.195]  And then at the very event we got videotape of this weekend in Austin, there are women in hijabs there, clapping.
[00:23:46.195 --> 00:23:50.538]  Yay!
[00:23:50.538 --> 00:24:00.585]  This is the weirdness that the globalists have engineered, where they love an authoritarian, anti-homosexual religion.
[00:24:03.479 --> 00:24:09.347]  And then they integrate it in with women in hijabs that are suppressed and controlled at these bizarre events.
[00:24:13.413 --> 00:24:17.174]  And it's just what Matt Bracken talks about, where the Islamists will show up suddenly in mass.
[00:24:17.174 --> 00:24:19.615]  The first wave, they adopt your culture.
[00:24:19.615 --> 00:24:24.977]  The second wave, suddenly they come out in mass as part of Islam to condition you and to teach you.
[00:24:24.977 --> 00:24:28.979]  Let's roll that footage for TV viewers of what was happening in Minnesota.
[00:24:28.979 --> 00:24:30.680]  This is the Mall of America.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.961]  This is yesterday, the same day that there's the stabbing.
[00:24:36.431 --> 00:24:38.052]  And this is what's happening.
[00:24:38.052 --> 00:24:45.377]  And the camera goes on, and on, and on, so you can see your new Somali majority.
[00:24:45.377 --> 00:24:50.881]  And then the other folks, they're not white, they're just Arabs.
[00:24:50.881 --> 00:25:02.169]  So the Arabs are the minority at the Mall of America, and the black, northeast Africans, where slavery's still legal.
[00:25:02.169 --> 00:25:05.211]  And then here is our new Somali god,
[00:25:07.008 --> 00:25:12.470]  Fahad Adredam, 20, is accused of stabbing two people at the Mall of America.
[00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.152]  And there he is!
[00:25:15.152 --> 00:25:17.513]  Suspect arrested after stabbing at Mall of America.
[00:25:17.513 --> 00:25:19.394]  20-year-old suspect.
[00:25:19.394 --> 00:25:23.695]  Bloomington Police said the incident happened Sunday evening in the first floor dressing room.
[00:25:23.695 --> 00:25:25.296]  The designer said the people didn't do anything.
[00:25:25.296 --> 00:25:31.279]  On the surveillance camera, he just walks over and starts stabbing them.
[00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:35.541]  Police say the first victim was stabbed after he returned to the dressing room and confronted
[00:25:36.633 --> 00:25:57.480]  Mahad Abababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababababab
[00:26:05.836 --> 00:26:08.319]  Robbing, stealing, pirating.
[00:26:08.319 --> 00:26:11.563]  What is the main culture of Somalia?
[00:26:11.563 --> 00:26:14.767]  Pirating and abandoning.
[00:26:14.767 --> 00:26:16.549]  All their neighbors hate them.
[00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:17.630]  Sudan won't let them in.
[00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:19.831]  Kenya won't let him in.
[00:26:19.831 --> 00:26:23.494]  And those are black people that won't let Somalis into their country.
[00:26:23.494 --> 00:26:29.599]  Do you know how many people Saudi Arabia allows in from Somalia to come there as refugees?
[00:26:29.599 --> 00:26:30.319]  Zero.
[00:26:30.319 --> 00:26:38.706]  Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[00:26:38.706 --> 00:26:41.027]  Zero.
[00:26:41.027 --> 00:26:42.769]  Oh, but here, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:26:43.911 --> 00:26:56.500]  Let's just go to the mall, and it's 90-something percent Somalis, and then you catch somebody robbing you, and boy, you're gonna get stabbed, somebody else is gonna get stabbed.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.203]  Can we go out to break with just the last 40 seconds of the song?
[00:27:00.203 --> 00:27:02.705]  That again has been seen over 40 million times.
[00:27:02.705 --> 00:27:05.567]  The Alex Jones, Bon Iver piece.
[00:27:07.304 --> 00:27:14.010]  So that everybody can just understand and just know what we're dealing with here and how serious this is.
[00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:15.050]  I'm not making a joke out of it.
[00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:15.971]  It's very, very sad.
[00:27:15.971 --> 00:27:17.052]  They made a joke out of it.
[00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:17.793]  It's super deluxe.
[00:27:17.793 --> 00:27:19.154]  Time Warner did.
[00:27:19.154 --> 00:27:28.501]  They took the video and made a joke about it, but now it's become a national anthem against this insanity they're force-feeding us, the cultural death they're force-feeding us.
[00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:34.566]  But again, briefly, we are going to end free shipping tomorrow.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:53.110]  The specials we have for the last four days are gone because a lot of those items were about to sell out, like Super Male Vitality and Super Female Vitality, but the Probiotic Biome Defense, about to sell out, but still 50% off.

[00:28:06.175 --> 00:28:08.656]  That's 50% off as well.
[00:28:08.656 --> 00:28:09.377]  Free shipping.
[00:28:09.377 --> 00:28:10.558]  It's got to end.
[00:28:10.558 --> 00:28:14.320]  Z-Shield is also being added for the things that have gotten taken off the list.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.321]  The amazing Heavy Metal Detoxifier.

[00:28:20.444 --> 00:28:22.805]  But when we come back, we are going to air
[00:28:32.785 --> 00:28:52.512]  The piece that Gavin Wentz and Millie Weaver shot inside the bizarro world, and that's putting it lightly, of men dressed as women having children give them tips for twerking their butts in the children's faces.
[00:28:52.512 --> 00:28:53.972]  But it's okay because it's liberal.
[00:28:53.972 --> 00:28:55.433]  It's not sexualizing children.
[00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:56.193]  It's a wonderful thing.

[00:29:27.353 --> 00:29:29.975]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[00:29:29.975 --> 00:29:30.995]  That's true.
[00:29:30.995 --> 00:29:36.058]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?
[00:29:36.058 --> 00:29:41.262]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty and guarantees.

[00:29:59.289 --> 00:30:02.431]  America is an information-based civil war.
[00:30:02.431 --> 00:30:09.855]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[00:30:09.855 --> 00:30:15.339]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:23.929]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[00:30:23.929 --> 00:30:31.839]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[00:30:32.479 --> 00:30:37.542]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[00:30:37.542 --> 00:30:39.683]  They are the anti-liberals.
[00:30:39.683 --> 00:30:53.070]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at infowarstore.com.

[00:30:58.109 --> 00:31:18.077]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:31:18.077 --> 00:31:20.198]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:31:20.198 --> 00:31:23.919]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:25.400]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:31.444]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.

[00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:41.751]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:41.751 --> 00:31:50.937]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:31:50.937 --> 00:31:55.380]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.029]  We're good.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.440]  We're running the biggest specials.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:08.402]  We run them like six months and free shipping store-wide at InfoWorksStore.com.
[00:32:08.402 --> 00:32:12.783]  And when we sell products at this low a price, we've got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation.
[00:32:12.783 --> 00:32:18.124]  But I know the products are so good, even though we make a very small profit on each item, you'll like them and then order more.
[00:32:18.124 --> 00:32:26.227]  Especially things like the coffee that's so good, or our toothpaste, or our mouthwash, or our vitamin-mineral fusion, the fruit punch drink.

[00:32:28.007 --> 00:32:30.188]  Multivitamins are probiotic.
[00:32:30.188 --> 00:32:30.668]  All of it.
[00:32:30.668 --> 00:32:32.489]  Supramel Vitality.

[00:32:32.769 --> 00:32:33.689]  Never done that.
[00:32:33.689 --> 00:32:34.450]  And free shipping.
[00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.190]  Boom.
[00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.650]  Supramel Vitality.

[00:32:37.191 --> 00:32:37.951]  With free shipping.
[00:32:37.951 --> 00:32:38.491]  Boom.

[00:32:40.152 --> 00:32:41.172]  With free shipping.
[00:32:41.172 --> 00:32:43.393]  With the free shipping, folks, it's a lost leader.
[00:32:43.393 --> 00:32:46.854]  You sign up for AutoShip, we're losing like six, seven dollars on this.
[00:32:46.854 --> 00:32:47.435]  Doesn't matter.
[00:32:47.435 --> 00:32:48.915]  I just want you to see how great it is.
[00:32:48.915 --> 00:32:52.056]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast.
[00:32:52.056 --> 00:32:55.238]  America Rebirth and Renaissance with so much coming up today.
[00:33:00.689 --> 00:33:09.774]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:09.774 --> 00:33:14.796]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:33:14.796 --> 00:33:22.501]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[00:33:22.501 --> 00:33:28.764]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.871 --> 00:33:48.668]  Alright, if you're radio listeners, we're gonna voice over some of this play-by-play, but for TV viewers, viewer discretion is advised.
[00:33:48.668 --> 00:33:50.711]  This is really disturbing footage.
[00:33:52.577 --> 00:34:01.345]  That Millie Weaver and Gavin Wintz shot at the International Drag Queen Festival here in Austin, Texas this weekend.
[00:34:01.345 --> 00:34:06.589]  I want to be clear, the media, every time we cover this stuff, misrepresents that we hate gay people or drag queens.
[00:34:06.589 --> 00:34:08.230]  That is not what's happening.
[00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:12.934]  I don't care if it's a bunch of heterosexuals, you know, saying, in their twerking for children.
[00:34:13.855 --> 00:34:16.217]  Or homosexuals, or whatever.
[00:34:16.217 --> 00:34:20.440]  The point is, is that this is serious sexualization of children.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:26.564]  Some of the people there may not get that or understand it, but you've got men twerking for children that give them tips.
[00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:27.625]  Totally inappropriate.
[00:34:27.625 --> 00:34:28.005]  You've got...
[00:34:29.506 --> 00:34:34.688]  Men totally naked except for glitter on their genitalia with little boys and little girls.
[00:34:34.688 --> 00:34:36.588]  Scroll down and show TV viewers folks.
[00:34:36.588 --> 00:34:38.749]  I mean, that's just glitter.
[00:34:38.749 --> 00:34:43.910]  Some of the footage was so shocking you didn't show it, though they have their own YouTube channels and stream this live.
[00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:45.771]  They were proud of this.
[00:34:45.771 --> 00:34:47.851]  So this is sexualization of children.
[00:34:47.851 --> 00:34:52.973]  If you saw a man at the park that was on a jungle gym naked,
[00:34:54.403 --> 00:35:04.050]  If you saw a man at the park who had glitter on his genitalia with a wig on, and Ted's giving him dollars, you'd think you were in the Twilight Zone and called the police.
[00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:11.096]  This is crazy how under the guise of art and under the guise of tolerance, this is happening all over the Western world.
[00:35:11.096 --> 00:35:12.977]  It's not just that drag queens go into story time.
[00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:15.099]  They go, you're going to be a drag queen, aren't you?
[00:35:15.099 --> 00:35:16.560]  Swish, swish, swish.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.641]  Oh, thank you.
[00:35:17.641 --> 00:35:19.842]  And then now it's gone to men on their knees.
[00:35:20.643 --> 00:35:24.946]  Simulating sex with little kids running up, simulating it and giving them money.
[00:35:24.946 --> 00:35:28.988]  Millie Weaver, what gave you and Gavin the idea to go do this, and what did you think once you got there?
[00:35:28.988 --> 00:35:30.789]  Because I've never seen anything this extreme.
[00:35:31.428 --> 00:35:40.835]  Well, we've seen already how there have been children drag queens already coming out in the media, which the LGBTQ community has been promoting.
[00:35:40.835 --> 00:35:46.600]  So when we looked into the Austin International Drag Festival, we saw their headliners.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.823]  And in their headliners, they had a young boy dressed in drag.
[00:35:50.823 --> 00:35:51.664]  That's right, you heard me.
[00:35:51.664 --> 00:35:52.965]  Dressed in drag.
[00:35:52.965 --> 00:35:58.389]  And he was one of the performers alongside performers that had the most raunchy, disgusting names.
[00:35:58.909 --> 00:35:59.750]  And this is conditioning!
[00:36:18.172 --> 00:36:20.293]  It was just completely inappropriate.
[00:36:20.293 --> 00:36:26.157]  Now, it would be funny if it were just all adults, maybe drinking cocktails and laughing.
[00:36:26.157 --> 00:36:27.478]  Oh, it's funny, you know.
[00:36:27.478 --> 00:36:31.240]  But that's when you have an adult audience, not when you have children there.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.861]  And that's the whole point.
[00:36:32.861 --> 00:36:37.504]  You don't take your daughters or your sons when they're three or four years old to a strip bar.
[00:36:37.944 --> 00:36:38.184]  Exactly.
[00:36:38.184 --> 00:36:39.705]  You don't, you don't do that.
[00:36:39.705 --> 00:36:41.887]  And the point is they know what they're doing.
[00:36:41.887 --> 00:36:47.131]  The groups, the organizations you're talking about, the symbols that were there, everything going on.
[00:36:47.131 --> 00:36:50.613]  This is the, this is creep-ville to the max.
[00:36:50.613 --> 00:36:54.236]  We're going to come back after break after we played this and analyze it more.
[00:36:54.236 --> 00:36:58.239]  But on Infowars.com, the video has gone live.
[00:36:58.239 --> 00:37:00.060]  It's on Twitter at RelAlexJones.
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:00.380]  It's on
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:13.787]  Facebook, these are people that wanted the media here, they wanted to show you this, they wanted you to see this, they wanted to see men, obese men acting like strippers with young children giving them money.
[00:37:13.787 --> 00:37:21.452]  This is what they wanted you to see, so now we're going to show you the true, in your face,
[00:37:22.881 --> 00:37:32.945]  Coming out of this underculture that people talk about the creepiness of the fashion shows where little boys and little girls dress a little scantily, okay, or dress like adults.
[00:37:32.945 --> 00:37:35.046]  This is 50 levels more.
[00:37:35.046 --> 00:37:35.986]  Yes.
[00:37:35.986 --> 00:37:43.449]  And you know, some of the drag queens that were participating talked about and bragged about how they do the story time with drag queens.
[00:37:43.449 --> 00:37:48.851]  So they are the same drag queens that do the story time readings at these libraries with children.
[00:37:48.851 --> 00:37:52.252]  And they were bragging about that saying, oh, family programming, ha ha ha.
[00:37:52.732 --> 00:37:56.954]  And they even said in the future, all of your children will be dressing like this!
[00:37:56.954 --> 00:38:01.316]  And that was kind of the theme that they wanted to promote, that this is the future.
[00:38:01.316 --> 00:38:08.640]  And a lot of leftists don't want paramilitary groups in the schools training kids like ROTC to wear uniforms, because it is a feeder group in the military.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.341]  We have to decide whether you want your children in those programs at the school or not.
[00:38:11.341 --> 00:38:19.825]  This is force-fed to entire assemblies to confuse the gender run by the Tavistock Institute out of England that is their MI6 mind control bureau.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.421]  I mean, look at this one shot right here.
[00:38:22.421 --> 00:38:23.502]  Scroll down please.
[00:38:23.502 --> 00:38:26.905]  This is a man with his genitals covered.
[00:38:28.843 --> 00:38:31.385]  And with a boy dressed as a girl.
[00:38:31.385 --> 00:38:38.531]  I mean, this is, this is unbelievable and we all know what it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:41.253]  We all know exactly what it is.
[00:38:41.253 --> 00:38:50.300]  This is the exact same type of art and crap getting promoted by Tony Podesta, the brother of John Podesta, who just had his big lobbying firm shut down.
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:50.501]  Millie?
[00:38:51.121 --> 00:38:59.669]  Well, you know, what's interesting also to know is that the young drag queen boy that was there, his mothers were there alongside him.
[00:38:59.669 --> 00:39:07.216]  And it just goes to show that this is what happens, this is the culture, and these children are being overly sexualized.
[00:39:08.097 --> 00:39:09.978]  Mill Pegley has called it sexual abuse.
[00:39:09.978 --> 00:39:11.279]  She's a liberal lesbian!
[00:39:11.279 --> 00:39:11.879]  It is!
[00:39:11.879 --> 00:39:23.166]  You start trying to tell 3, 4, 5, 6 year olds that there's something else, and trying to put it in their head, and then take them to things that give fat men pole dancing money, shaking their butts in the kids' faces?
[00:39:23.166 --> 00:39:23.847]  This is sick!
[00:39:24.406 --> 00:39:25.486]  It is disgusting.
[00:39:25.486 --> 00:39:27.787]  You had people there dressed inappropriately.
[00:39:27.787 --> 00:39:31.628]  I could never even imagine as a woman wearing what these drag queens were wearing.
[00:39:31.628 --> 00:39:41.130]  You had somebody come out with just like a clear, like, mesh looking top that had just black taped X's over the nipples, giving the children hugs.
[00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:43.411]  It was just really disturbing.
[00:39:43.411 --> 00:39:44.811]  I couldn't even imagine.
[00:39:44.811 --> 00:39:46.092]  I was sitting there trying to be like, okay,
[00:39:47.433 --> 00:39:51.816]  How are we even talking about this without it just being completely disturbing to people?
[00:39:51.816 --> 00:39:57.881]  This is total conditioning, and I guarantee you, you research the headliners and their names, you know what you're going to find at the bottom of it.
[00:39:57.881 --> 00:40:04.526]  I mean, this is full-grown men dressed as women, seductively dancing for little girls and boys, being given money by them.
[00:40:05.186 --> 00:40:07.807]  Again, if you saw this driving by the park, what would you do?
[00:40:07.807 --> 00:40:10.528]  You'd think an alternate dimension of hell had opened.
[00:40:10.528 --> 00:40:12.189]  And here's the other part here.
[00:40:12.189 --> 00:40:13.709]  Here's the other element.
[00:40:13.709 --> 00:40:21.152]  The drag queens attracted an audience of what I like to call and what I thought looked like, in my opinion, Johns.
[00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:29.415]  You had a bunch of regular-looking dudes there that were totally perving on the drag queens, winking at them, giving them money, giving them kisses on the face.
[00:40:29.415 --> 00:40:30.996]  Oh yeah, I mean, it's like, look, look, look, look, look.
[00:40:31.476 --> 00:40:33.537]  I've been to topless bars in years and years, but I've been to them.
[00:40:33.537 --> 00:40:36.238]  You see how the guy goes up and gives the money and how the guys are looking?
[00:40:36.238 --> 00:40:49.202]  I mean, it is an incredible scene of a bunch of men with a bunch of little kids dancing around scantily clad, with a bunch of men scantily clad dancing around, and some men with no clothes on but glitter on their genitals.
[00:40:49.202 --> 00:40:49.762]  Exactly.
[00:40:49.762 --> 00:40:51.023]  With children.
[00:40:51.023 --> 00:40:52.223]  You had some in the monitor.
[00:40:52.223 --> 00:40:54.064]  I mean, basically, naked men with children.
[00:40:54.064 --> 00:40:57.445]  And watch, the media is either going to totally ignore this or turn it around.
[00:40:58.624 --> 00:41:08.048]  Exactly, and you had- And who at the Huffington Post and BuzzFeed and places and salon that promotes pedophilia, what are you doing signing on to all this and covering it up?
[00:41:08.048 --> 00:41:09.928]  What is wrong with you people?
[00:41:09.928 --> 00:41:12.489]  This isn't tolerance, this is sick!
[00:41:12.489 --> 00:41:14.290]  It's gonna bite you all in the butt, you watch.
[00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:19.352]  The LGBTQ community needs to denounce this behavior.
[00:41:19.352 --> 00:41:27.276]  They need to stop putting children in this environment and exposing them to mature content because this is what's going to happen.
[00:41:27.276 --> 00:41:31.238]  It's going to actually make it so that people say, well, I guess all of it's being abused.
[00:41:31.238 --> 00:41:32.399]  Let's throw it all out.
[00:41:32.399 --> 00:41:43.364]  When in reality, it's essentially like bringing kids to a mock strip club performance event where you have them all dressed in clothing, but removing some articles of clothing alongside one
[00:41:43.604 --> 00:41:46.125]  Look, this was one step away.
[00:41:46.125 --> 00:41:48.066]  It all had the feeling of a swingers club.
[00:41:48.066 --> 00:41:49.646]  Oh yeah.
[00:41:49.646 --> 00:41:52.367]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's just stop right there.
[00:41:52.367 --> 00:41:55.869]  We're gonna go to break, come back with the footage that I don't even want to play.
[00:41:55.869 --> 00:41:59.770]  And again, Millie, I think you should put out the stuff that you said you guys didn't put out.
[00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.311]  I think we need to put out the most hardcore.
[00:42:02.311 --> 00:42:05.393]  Because people just have a right to see this, they need to know.
[00:42:05.393 --> 00:42:07.193]  But men with nothing on, but...
[00:42:09.791 --> 00:42:15.271]  Flex of glass, glitter on their genitals, posing with children.
[00:42:16.952 --> 00:42:37.879]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, this is the gay pride parade on PCP with your children in the middle of it, and people saying, be tolerant, be nice, don't restrict us, don't restrict us, and it's just the most wanton grab at children's innocence I've ever seen.
[00:42:37.879 --> 00:42:41.421]  Because I guess they've probed with the drag train things we've got from AP.
[00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:48.604]  Telling kids you're gonna be drag queens and you know guys shaking their butts and their faces there to the next level.
[00:42:48.604 --> 00:42:54.966]  Ladies and gentlemen, then it becomes a protected group that you can't criticize because of their group any of their activities.
[00:42:54.966 --> 00:42:56.127]  This is the Facebook plan.

[00:47:01.187 --> 00:47:03.788]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:11.488 --> 00:47:14.113]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:14.113 --> 00:47:19.241]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:47:21.698 --> 00:47:28.082]  So, we know Hollywood, we know Nambla, we know all these groups have an agenda to break up the family into sexualized children.
[00:47:28.082 --> 00:47:31.825]  And we know how they run their operations through the United Nations and other groups.
[00:47:31.825 --> 00:47:36.548]  And so all over the country and all over the world, they have these drag queen days at schools.
[00:47:36.548 --> 00:47:39.270]  You think, oh, okay, it's a drag queen coming to rape the kids.
[00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:42.492]  And they tell them, I'm a man dressed as a woman, I'm a drag queen, you could be one too.
[00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:48.536]  I mean, imagine if just a random guy showed up and said, like, Judge Roy Moore, I'm here, you're five years old.
[00:47:49.557 --> 00:47:52.559]  And I just want to know, someday you might want to date me, little honey.
[00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:54.401]  You'd say that was grooming and totally sick.
[00:47:54.401 --> 00:47:58.264]  But because the left does it, and the media backs it up, they go along with it.
[00:47:58.264 --> 00:48:00.285]  Now, Millie, we're not going to say these names on air.
[00:48:00.285 --> 00:48:01.667]  Some of them you can.
[00:48:01.667 --> 00:48:07.131]  But even for family friendly, we can say some of the names as the FCC on our radio stations, but I don't want to.
[00:48:07.131 --> 00:48:08.492]  Some we can't.
[00:48:08.492 --> 00:48:15.497]  But you pointed out during the break, it was about debasing women, and there was also a lot of Satanism overtones, of course.
[00:48:15.497 --> 00:48:16.618]  Repeat what you said during the break.
[00:48:17.879 --> 00:48:23.321]  Believe it or not, watching their performances, I began to feel somewhat insulted.
[00:48:23.321 --> 00:48:33.423]  I know that sounds bizarre, but I was like, so you're gonna say that you're a woman, and then you're gonna prance around in the most derogatory sense, disrespecting women.
[00:48:33.423 --> 00:48:39.105]  They had women, or drag queens, dressed like cleaning ladies, like, you know,
[00:48:39.525 --> 00:48:40.847]  Yeah, but that's the whole point.
[00:48:40.847 --> 00:48:44.691]  Debase children, debase men, debase women.
[00:48:44.691 --> 00:48:45.412]  Is it funny?
[00:48:45.412 --> 00:48:46.393]  You're absolutely right.
[00:48:46.393 --> 00:48:49.697]  Tell people the names of what they call women.
[00:48:49.697 --> 00:48:53.201]  And if anybody else did it, they would say, was to debase women.
[00:48:53.201 --> 00:48:54.042]  Tell people the names.
[00:48:54.602 --> 00:48:59.706]  So, one of the names was Muffy Fish Basket, another was Eatin' Johnson.
[00:48:59.706 --> 00:49:02.448]  I mean, the names were just completely raunchy and debasing.
[00:49:02.448 --> 00:49:03.489]  And they announced it to the kids!
[00:49:03.489 --> 00:49:05.010]  They go, it's Eating Johnson!
[00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:05.911]  Yeah!
[00:49:05.911 --> 00:49:07.552]  It's Rotten Fish Basket!
[00:49:07.552 --> 00:49:07.772]  Yeah!
[00:49:07.772 --> 00:49:10.635]  But again, the names were all about rotting, stinking women.
[00:49:10.635 --> 00:49:11.195]  Get into that!
[00:49:11.195 --> 00:49:11.415]  Yes!
[00:49:11.415 --> 00:49:12.556]  Which is debasing women.
[00:49:12.556 --> 00:49:13.897]  This is so sick!
[00:49:13.897 --> 00:49:20.903]  The names were completely just horrible and the whole theme was kind of disrespectful towards women.
[00:49:20.903 --> 00:49:22.544]  I mean, imagine if... That's what it is!
[00:49:22.544 --> 00:49:23.545]  The whole thing is about
[00:49:24.335 --> 00:49:26.337]  Becoming the women and then pulling down the women.
[00:49:26.337 --> 00:49:28.798]  The whole thing, the whole globalist program is aimed at women.
[00:49:28.798 --> 00:49:31.380]  That's in the declassified documents!
[00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:43.970]  Well, imagine if somebody said they identified as a different racial group and in this picture... Imagine if I put blackface on and then ran around simulated robbing people and killing people, which would be totally racist and evil and stereotypical.
[00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:44.670]  Exactly.
[00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:45.891]  But it's okay, the left can do it.
[00:49:45.891 --> 00:49:52.036]  They can sexualize children, they can do racial stuff, they can tell the nastiest jokes you've ever heard, as long as you're not white.
[00:49:52.276 --> 00:49:58.518]  And if these drag queens are saying, oh, we're women, we're depicting women, what is that telling little girls to be like?
[00:49:58.518 --> 00:50:02.700]  Should they be role models for little girls, saying this is how women should behave like?
[00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.741]  I've decided to fight on this subject.
[00:50:04.741 --> 00:50:08.282]  We were told by Facebook last week, and we did record it, and we told them we recorded it.
[00:50:08.282 --> 00:50:15.685]  They actually had one of their high-level folks call us and say, we're going to start running stuff by you, and if you don't do what we say and take stuff down yourself, we're banning you.
[00:50:16.448 --> 00:50:19.869]  Well, hey, Uncle Barry, throw me in that briar patch.
[00:50:19.869 --> 00:50:25.891]  And I know what they're going to do with this, because the one thing they said, you will not criticize drag queens, you will not say the word tranny.
[00:50:25.891 --> 00:50:27.152]  And I said, I looked up that word.
[00:50:27.152 --> 00:50:31.454]  It wasn't derogatory until 2017, when Facebook said it was.
[00:50:31.454 --> 00:50:34.154]  So they're now even controlling language.
[00:50:34.154 --> 00:50:35.075]  I don't even dislike
[00:50:35.775 --> 00:50:41.197]  Uh, you know, I mean, I'm sure there are a lot of people that are like that and into that who aren't going after kids.
[00:50:41.197 --> 00:50:50.601]  And there are a lot of folks that, you know, like Camille Paglia that's a lesbian, saying this is child abuse, what's happening, it's an evil agenda, the sexualization, the confusing the genders, it's a targeted program, it's admitted!
[00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:57.343]  But that said, they can't hide behind the whole LGBT thing and do things like this.
[00:50:57.343 --> 00:51:05.665]  I mean, imagine if a group of men put on parties where they danced naked in front of your kids, or scantily clad, and your children gave them money.
[00:51:05.665 --> 00:51:07.045]  That's called pedophilia.
[00:51:07.045 --> 00:51:08.486]  That's called pervert land.
[00:51:08.486 --> 00:51:12.607]  Well, it was happening, but because it was a public festival, it hid and blamed you.
[00:51:13.107 --> 00:51:13.568]  Exactly!
[00:51:13.568 --> 00:51:17.031]  It hit in plain view and because everyone had to be tolerant, see?
[00:51:17.031 --> 00:51:35.011]  It was almost really disturbing to watch the other people in the audience because you could tell a lot of them were bleeding heart liberals and they were essentially, when they were giving the money, they had this look of pride on their face that they were virtue signaling by supporting and giving money to this drag queen that's been so oppressed.
[00:51:35.211 --> 00:51:39.636]  And now everyone's being tricked into worshipping something.
[00:51:39.636 --> 00:51:45.383]  Creepy fat men in clown makeup, half naked, shaking their butts in kids' faces.
[00:51:45.383 --> 00:51:49.648]  Suddenly this total debasement of everybody is cool and wonderful.
[00:51:49.648 --> 00:51:52.752]  Oh, but they want strip bars shut down because it debases women.
[00:51:52.972 --> 00:51:54.833]  No, they want to control women.
[00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:59.934]  The left wants to pimp and run women, because women are the heart of all civilization.
[00:51:59.934 --> 00:52:06.756]  The advertisers know it, every culture knew it, Islam keeps them locked up, the West does it, and that's why the West is under attack.
[00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:18.719]  And it's disgusting when you would see that, those toddlers, those young little beauty queens, kind of being overly sexualized when they have them all done up in makeup, they have false teeth to make it look like they have adult women teeth.
[00:52:19.339 --> 00:52:19.640]  We're good.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:38.901]  But we're going to start getting to it now.
[00:52:38.901 --> 00:52:43.443]  The full footage that's in her piece, I guess there's even more, is on InfoWars.com.
[00:52:43.443 --> 00:52:44.744]  Let's put it on screen.
[00:52:44.744 --> 00:52:47.686]  Everyone doesn't want to watch this, but you've got to watch it.
[00:52:47.686 --> 00:52:49.667]  You've got to know what's going on in your public schools.
[00:52:49.667 --> 00:52:51.968]  You've got to know what's happening in public, what's happening.
[00:52:51.968 --> 00:52:53.810]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:55.831]  Drag Queen Festival in Austin promotes early
[00:52:57.225 --> 00:52:59.468]  Sexual gender confusion.
[00:52:59.468 --> 00:53:08.059]  And again, I have fought so hard on this title today until it's become one of these metaphysical things that is nearly impossible to get right.
[00:53:08.059 --> 00:53:11.123]  But we're going to get the headline right, right now, live on air.
[00:53:11.123 --> 00:53:12.706]  Put the headline back up for me, please.
[00:53:13.746 --> 00:53:14.826]  We're going to do this right now.
[00:53:14.826 --> 00:53:21.289]  The headline is Drag Queen Festival in Austin Promotes Early Sexualization of Children.
[00:53:21.289 --> 00:53:28.412]  Early Sexualization of Children Slash Gender Confusion.
[00:53:28.412 --> 00:53:29.573]  My kingdom for a horse.
[00:53:29.573 --> 00:53:29.973]  A horse.
[00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:30.633]  A horse.
[00:53:30.633 --> 00:53:31.414]  A kingdom for my horse.
[00:53:31.414 --> 00:53:33.054]  It's just funny how things work.
[00:53:33.054 --> 00:53:36.116]  Things run so well around here, but once something doesn't work,
[00:53:37.236 --> 00:53:38.396]  Hell could just come out of the ground and kill us.
[00:53:38.396 --> 00:53:40.237]  I mean, because I have been for three hours hammering this headline.
[00:53:40.237 --> 00:54:01.903]  Hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering, hammering
[00:54:03.112 --> 00:54:05.133]  Okay, that is the headline for YouTube.
[00:54:05.133 --> 00:54:06.454]  That is the headline.
[00:54:06.454 --> 00:54:07.374]  That is the headline.
[00:54:07.374 --> 00:54:08.975]  Excuse me, go ahead.
[00:54:08.975 --> 00:54:16.780]  Well, you know, the whole lesson from this thing, this experience going to this festival, which was so creepy.
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:20.562]  The energy there was just so dark, so creepy.
[00:54:20.562 --> 00:54:26.825]  I wanted to leave many parts of it, just seeing the way that the children were being exposed to mature content.
[00:54:26.825 --> 00:54:29.787]  But the lesson here is that this is a slippery slope.
[00:54:30.347 --> 00:54:37.472]  When you start saying, okay, it's okay to bring drag queens into schools and have them do these books, story time telling.
[00:54:37.472 --> 00:54:45.397]  Well, these are the same people that are going and performing at these drag festivals and now children are being drug into it.
[00:54:45.397 --> 00:54:52.422]  You have children being overly sexualized, watching these drag queens twerking around.
[00:54:52.422 --> 00:54:56.565]  They had them like spreading their legs, dance around on these rings.
[00:54:56.565 --> 00:54:58.306]  We got it.
[00:54:58.306 --> 00:54:59.306]  The headlines up there.
[00:54:59.306 --> 00:55:00.087]  Let's put it up there.
[00:55:00.967 --> 00:55:03.468]  Here is a man humping with his butt in the air.
[00:55:03.468 --> 00:55:04.589]  He's like twerking or something.
[00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:07.350]  With children running over giving them money and then they're pole dancing.
[00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:08.910]  Men!
[00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:13.672]  Men dress as women with children and then a woman in a hijab!
[00:55:13.672 --> 00:55:14.793]  What about that?
[00:55:14.793 --> 00:55:16.793]  Oh yeah, that was the weirdest part of all.
[00:55:16.793 --> 00:55:24.116]  There was a woman in a hijab there and she was giving money to the little trans drag queen child.
[00:55:24.116 --> 00:55:27.617]  You know under Islam, men having sex with boys is okay.
[00:55:27.617 --> 00:55:28.958]  Men with men, they execute you.
[00:55:29.562 --> 00:55:31.245]  That was just very confusing.
[00:55:31.245 --> 00:55:32.527]  I couldn't- Look at this!
[00:55:32.527 --> 00:55:33.228]  Let me go back.
[00:55:33.228 --> 00:55:35.332]  We've got a man dressed like a woman with his shirt off.
[00:55:36.345 --> 00:55:50.777]  I mean this is just... And here's the thing here, this particular image that we are watching is a boy who calls himself Lactatia, as a drag queen, and they're making fun of, oh I'm a Lactator, Lactatia, and they're making fun of it, and it's like, no you're not.
[00:55:50.777 --> 00:55:51.897]  Okay, no you're not.
[00:55:51.897 --> 00:55:55.680]  And the slap in the face here is they want us to acknowledge them as women.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.422]  Excuse me, you are not a woman.
[00:55:57.422 --> 00:56:00.865]  You do not have to deal with a monthly pain in the butt.
[00:56:00.865 --> 00:56:02.846]  Well they talk about cultural appropriation.
[00:56:05.964 --> 00:56:08.106]  I mean, talk about cultural appropriation.
[00:56:08.106 --> 00:56:22.377]  This is cultural appropriation saying you're a woman, but then they tell anybody else, oh, you can't go to Oktoberfest if you're not German, or you can't go to Cinco de Mayo if you're not Mexican, trying to keep us all in our little gribs controlled, but then they literally appropriate the whole deal and then tell you what it is to be a woman!
[00:56:22.777 --> 00:56:24.539]  You're not a womb man.
[00:56:24.539 --> 00:56:26.381]  A womb man!
[00:56:26.381 --> 00:56:27.762]  A man with a womb!
[00:56:27.762 --> 00:56:29.283]  Okay?
[00:56:29.283 --> 00:56:32.467]  Women have to deal with certain things, certain problems, certain issues.
[00:56:32.467 --> 00:56:40.414]  You don't get to choose, you know, whether or not you're going to deal with certain womenly issues, especially your monthly issue there.
[00:56:40.414 --> 00:56:45.820]  But these guys that want to dress up as women and say they're women, make a mockery, disrespect women... Absolutely.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.401]  They want to claim rights of womanhood.
[00:56:48.401 --> 00:56:52.383]  They want to claim that they should be able to compete alongside women in women's sports.
[00:56:52.383 --> 00:56:58.527]  Hey, even in the Olympics now, the main winners of the races are men that say they're women.
[00:56:58.527 --> 00:56:58.987]  Exactly.
[00:56:58.987 --> 00:57:07.652]  It's this total freakazoid world where they say we're hateful because we believe there's a male whale, a female whale, a male possum, a female possum.
[00:57:08.152 --> 00:57:10.374]  You know, there's a male lizard, a female lizard.
[00:57:10.374 --> 00:57:18.819]  I mean, this is a total overthrow of reality, and then saying on the entrance forms, we don't have a right to say male or female, because that might hurt somebody else.
[00:57:18.819 --> 00:57:20.921]  They have new pronouns for it all.
[00:57:20.921 --> 00:57:22.402]  We never got to the video.
[00:57:22.402 --> 00:57:27.045]  We played some of the images for TV viewers, but it's on Infowars.com, and we did get the headline right.
[00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:29.451]  Which is awesome!
[00:57:29.451 --> 00:57:34.114]  Drag Queen Festival in Austin promotes early sexualization of children!
[00:57:34.114 --> 00:57:37.136]  Gender confusion!
[00:57:37.136 --> 00:57:40.258]  And it's key to get out because they've gone a step too far.
[00:57:40.258 --> 00:57:41.339]  Oh look, it's a unicorn!
[00:57:41.339 --> 00:57:46.042]  I forgot to mention, the naked guy with the little kid is a unicorn, so it's okay.
[00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:55.332]  I'm very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.

[00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:57.890]  A 360 win.

[00:59:12.374 --> 00:59:12.954]  Number three,

[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:51.150]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:53.773]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.603 --> 01:00:15.224]  I'm Alex Jones, Millie Weaver, our great reporters here.
[01:00:15.224 --> 01:00:15.624]  And you know what?
[01:00:15.624 --> 01:00:16.545]  This type of stuff gets to me.
[01:00:16.545 --> 01:00:28.189]  I mean, when I start actually flipping out on air, it's because attacks on our youth, attacks on our innocence, when they're so overt, make me physically sick.
[01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:32.831]  And to know how the media is going to spin it, how they're going to hide behind stuff, makes it even matter.
[01:00:32.831 --> 01:00:35.672]  You know, Millie Weaver and Gavin Winch cut out of the report.
[01:00:38.391 --> 01:00:40.895]  People touching children inappropriately.
[01:00:40.895 --> 01:00:42.337]  And I think you should go to the police department.
[01:00:42.337 --> 01:00:44.560]  No, you got to take the gloves off.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.165]  And, you know, I just that's what we're getting into.
[01:00:48.165 --> 01:00:50.568]  So recap what we were just covering.
[01:00:50.568 --> 01:00:51.930]  Kind of put some bookends on this.
[01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.033]  I got to some of the report earlier.
[01:00:55.033 --> 01:00:55.734]  We showed some of it.
[01:00:55.734 --> 01:01:00.437]  I've got an AP report we could get to, which showed the gateway to this, you know, where, oh, you're going to be a drag queen.
[01:01:00.437 --> 01:01:01.698]  Here's how you're a drag queen.
[01:01:01.698 --> 01:01:02.739]  Shake your butt.
[01:01:02.739 --> 01:01:05.060]  Again, it's all sexualization of children.
[01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:05.981]  It's manipulating them.
[01:01:05.981 --> 01:01:10.625]  It's introducing them at a young age to a lifestyle that parents should be able to choose.
[01:01:10.625 --> 01:01:14.147]  You know, the argument here is parents were taking their kids to this, and some of them were useful idiots.
[01:01:14.147 --> 01:01:18.730]  But, I mean, just the images of, I mean, how did you handle it when you saw men
[01:01:19.491 --> 01:01:24.608]  With nothing on, naked, but glitter on their genitals, with little boys dressed as girls.
[01:01:25.399 --> 01:01:26.820]  It was disturbing.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:27.580]  It was disturbing.
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:38.647]  I felt sick to my stomach as I'm watching this, and at the same time I can't help but fear the backlash from the liberal community, LGBT community of, oh you're hateful, you're hateful.
[01:01:38.647 --> 01:01:42.309]  No, this has nothing to do with being against homosexuality.
[01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:51.835]  But see how that gives those folks the moral high ground to dictate to all the gays and lesbians what their politics are, to now we've got men with glitter genitals with small children?
[01:01:52.635 --> 01:01:53.276]  In public?
[01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:55.257]  I mean, what the hell is this?
[01:01:55.257 --> 01:01:59.920]  If cops busted in a door, and there was a guy like this with a kid, you'd go to jail.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.181]  Yeah.
[01:02:00.181 --> 01:02:03.423]  But it's hiding in plain view, so it's like, okay.
[01:02:03.423 --> 01:02:15.912]  And they want to make you feel like you're doing something wrong by criticizing their community, when in reality the criticism here is that this is inappropriate and mature content that children should not be being exposed to.
[01:02:15.912 --> 01:02:17.193]  And then it keeps expanding.
[01:02:17.193 --> 01:02:17.933]  The community?
[01:02:17.933 --> 01:02:19.795]  I mean, does the community include NABLA?
[01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:21.204]  I'm sure!
[01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:25.368]  I wouldn't be surprised if there were NAMBLA members there.
[01:02:25.368 --> 01:02:36.960]  I mean, you had a lot of dudes who looked very kind of turned on watching these drag queens, these men dressed in drag, and then they're watching children as well.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.623]  And so it was just a really creepy vibe, the entire thing.
[01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:42.365]  And kids are watching these little
[01:02:44.207 --> 01:02:53.814]  Micro sexual encounters between the adult men and the drag queens and they're giving them money and then the kid comes up there and they're getting money from these same men.
[01:02:53.814 --> 01:02:56.475]  They're getting money from the same people in the audience.
[01:02:56.475 --> 01:03:00.438]  And it's almost like it's grooming kids to become strippers.
[01:03:00.438 --> 01:03:02.219]  I mean that's what I thought when I was watching it.
[01:03:02.219 --> 01:03:07.603]  Well yeah, imagine if people took their kids to a heterosexual event and had them handing money to hot women.
[01:03:07.603 --> 01:03:10.005]  That'd be like, dude this is creepy man.
[01:03:10.725 --> 01:03:11.345]  What are you doing?
[01:03:11.345 --> 01:03:13.547]  Women dancing around provocatively.
[01:03:13.547 --> 01:03:18.411]  With tape on their... With tape on their boobs.
[01:03:18.411 --> 01:03:23.075]  And then you have children dancing alongside them, you know, following up their act.
[01:03:23.075 --> 01:03:25.256]  But this is nothing what you're showing.
[01:03:25.256 --> 01:03:30.320]  I mean, there's men hanging upside down, kids giving them money, men on the ground shaking their butts in children's faces.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.222]  I mean, this is just bizarre.
[01:03:32.222 --> 01:03:39.027]  Some of the part that you're seeing here is the explicit language, the bad language that they're talking about announcing one of the people here.
[01:03:39.087 --> 01:03:44.681]  That's why I decided not to play this on radio because I'd reviewed it this morning but then it clicked.
[01:03:44.681 --> 01:03:47.127]  Some of these words I think are FCC violations plus just...
[01:03:48.061 --> 01:03:49.462]  I just can't air this.
[01:03:49.462 --> 01:03:50.843]  I just can't even air this.
[01:03:50.843 --> 01:03:53.746]  No, I didn't know what to do after we got this.
[01:03:53.746 --> 01:03:59.050]  And imagine, they'll probably ban these videos on Facebook and YouTube later once we post them, saying it's inappropriate.
[01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:01.972]  Well, then how the hell do you got four-year-old kids there?
[01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:02.573]  Exactly!
[01:04:02.573 --> 01:04:06.836]  If it's not appropriate for the radio, how is it appropriate for children?
[01:04:06.836 --> 01:04:08.557]  We have little, little children there.
[01:04:08.557 --> 01:04:14.182]  I think I saw a kid around three years old dressed in a princess outfit, which you can tell the child was a boy.
[01:04:15.683 --> 01:04:22.326]  And this is the parents doing it to him, as Camille Paglia said, a liberal lesbian who is not a child abuser.
[01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:24.326]  Hey, I totally get Camille Paglia liking women.
[01:04:24.326 --> 01:04:25.507]  If I was a woman, I probably wouldn't.
[01:04:25.507 --> 01:04:26.427]  I'm a libertarian!
[01:04:26.427 --> 01:04:29.488]  The point is, I'd not leave kids alone, man!
[01:04:29.488 --> 01:04:30.389]  Leave them out of it.
[01:04:30.389 --> 01:04:31.149]  Leave them out of it.
[01:04:31.149 --> 01:04:32.910]  It's too much, too soon.
[01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:34.410]  Who knows the ramifications?
[01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:37.551]  And then a boy dressed as a girl being worshipped by a bunch of pot-bellied guys?
[01:04:37.551 --> 01:04:37.892]  Yes.
[01:04:37.892 --> 01:04:39.232]  I mean, wow, this is not good.
[01:04:39.232 --> 01:04:40.753]  Hey, Millie Weaver, great job.
[01:04:40.753 --> 01:04:42.573]  Gavin Winston, great job.
[01:04:42.573 --> 01:04:43.834]  Let's look at that other footage.
[01:04:44.554 --> 01:04:46.895]  Get that to the police department.
[01:04:46.895 --> 01:04:51.357]  By the way, they've now accused Matt Drudge of being a Russian agent when we come back.
[01:04:51.357 --> 01:04:57.300]  So, for being associated with InfoWars.
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:00.442]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:05:00.442 --> 01:05:07.865]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[01:05:07.865 --> 01:05:13.468]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:05:14.208 --> 01:05:21.896]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[01:05:21.896 --> 01:05:29.765]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:05:30.505 --> 01:05:35.546]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[01:05:35.546 --> 01:05:37.686]  They are the anti-liberals.
[01:05:37.686 --> 01:05:51.069]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at infowarstore.com.
[01:05:51.069 --> 01:05:54.670]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at infowarstore.com.
[01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:04.427]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:08.510]  Because there is a war on.
[01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:10.691]  Or you're mine.
[01:06:10.691 --> 01:06:21.499]  So, we have seen the Clintons and Robert Mueller and Johnny Podesta and John Podesta who just had to shut down their lobbying firm this week.
[01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:24.781]  We have seen them openly
[01:06:27.105 --> 01:06:34.167]  Saying that Rand Paul is a Russian agent on the Senate floor, John McCain, or Tucker Carlson has had a congressman on the Senate.
[01:06:34.167 --> 01:06:35.227]  You're a Russian agent!
[01:06:35.227 --> 01:06:37.068]  You're getting paid, aren't you?
[01:06:37.068 --> 01:06:41.109]  And we've seen them say it about yours truly, Matt Drudge, everybody.
[01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:46.730]  It is just crazy.
[01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:53.292]  But here is a big story out of the Washington Post by Philip Bump, that I'm going to talk about a little bit later in the hour.
[01:06:54.597 --> 01:07:00.543]  Washington Post accuses Drudge of Russian collusion for linking to InfoWars.
[01:07:00.543 --> 01:07:02.826]  Left-wing paper suggests Matt Drudge a Russian agent.
[01:07:03.831 --> 01:07:10.135]  They didn't play semantical games and say that I'm a plagiarist for posting part of RT articles and linking to them.
[01:07:10.135 --> 01:07:12.696]  Well, yeah, I also post full articles from Voice of America.
[01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:14.177]  Doesn't mean I work for the CIA.
[01:07:14.177 --> 01:07:18.219]  I also republished all those WikiLeaks last week from the CIA.
[01:07:18.219 --> 01:07:21.421]  Did that mean I did all the hacking or I support the CIA?
[01:07:21.421 --> 01:07:23.062]  It's like these semantical games.
[01:07:23.062 --> 01:07:25.143]  Jones posted quotes from Hitler.
[01:07:25.143 --> 01:07:27.084]  I actually wrote this last year.
[01:07:27.084 --> 01:07:29.386]  Does he support Hitler?
[01:07:29.386 --> 01:07:32.848]  Okay, they're waging war on communication.
[01:07:34.394 --> 01:07:37.395]  They're creating more than a hysteria.
[01:07:37.395 --> 01:07:41.276]  It's like a... What's the word for it?
[01:07:41.276 --> 01:07:43.157]  We're afraid to walk on our ladders.
[01:07:43.157 --> 01:07:45.038]  Superstition.
[01:07:45.038 --> 01:07:46.038]  It's like an idiocracy.
[01:07:46.038 --> 01:07:47.639]  They go, wow, this one can read.
[01:07:47.639 --> 01:07:50.540]  What kind of weirdo is he?
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:51.120]  Not sure.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.000]  Well, that's your name?
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:52.340]  Not sure?
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.321]  No, I'm not sure.
[01:07:53.321 --> 01:07:53.861]  Oh, not sure?
[01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:54.441]  Okay, not sure.
[01:07:57.383 --> 01:08:13.015]  And then they report, like, our investigative teams found he linked to InfoWars hundreds of times, and he linked to RT, and then he leaked 5,000 times to the New York Times, which, if I was Drudge, I'd stop even doing that.
[01:08:13.015 --> 01:08:20.480]  I mean, he links to them, gives them half their traffic, literally, Washington Post, New York Times, half their traffic's from Drudge some weeks.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:21.761]  I know ours is, too.
[01:08:21.761 --> 01:08:23.683]  I mean, Drudge is like the King Daddy.
[01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:24.843]  Biggest website in the world.
[01:08:24.843 --> 01:08:26.685]  Number two in the world, technically, but biggest news site.
[01:08:32.546 --> 01:08:37.908]  Then they sit there and attack him for linking to Russian news.
[01:08:37.908 --> 01:08:42.209]  Yeah, if Russia has footage of a plane blowing up or a Putin speech, you bet that's news.
[01:08:42.209 --> 01:08:46.211]  And then they double link and go, oh, and then he links to Alex Jones, don't link to him.
[01:08:46.211 --> 01:08:55.794]  Well, thanks for the gift, because I know, oh, but now they're starting to complain that he's stopped linking to them as much.
[01:08:55.794 --> 01:08:58.555]  But if you look, he links to them way more
[01:08:59.537 --> 01:09:00.658]  Then he links to us.
[01:09:00.658 --> 01:09:22.761]  This is the scum trying to bully Drudge to link more to them, even though it's 10 to 1, 20 to 1, depending on the newspaper, or they'll say he's a Russian, when they're the ones the Democrats caught working with the Russians, and they're the ones with a huge history of it, and they're the ones with the Podesta Group closing because of it.
[01:09:26.314 --> 01:09:30.676]  And Drudge points out that on average he gives them 37% of their traffic.
[01:09:30.676 --> 01:09:33.418]  I was saying half their traffic sometimes, because I've seen those numbers.
[01:09:33.418 --> 01:09:35.819]  But yeah, 37%.
[01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:44.723]  Literally giving them hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising revenue, and they want to shut him down.
[01:09:44.723 --> 01:09:55.309]  And then he links to us a lot less, and they're like, hey, we're going to call you a Russian agent and have a Federal Elections Commission and a Federal Trade Commission investigation criminally to shut you down.
[01:09:56.971 --> 01:10:07.957]  You talk about crapping on somebody, you talk about rubbing it in, you talk about telling people what they can and can't link to, and what do they point to that they've linked to here?
[01:10:07.957 --> 01:10:17.662]  That WikiLeaks server was under attack and a press release by Julian Assange, and then that's the proof in the article, because Julian Assange is a Russian agent, just like Rand Paul, just like I am.
[01:10:17.662 --> 01:10:19.103]  Of course, it's not true.
[01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:25.830]  So, this is just incredible.
[01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:31.634]  Gavin McGinnis joins us, syndicated radio and TV host, former founder of Vice, you name it.
[01:10:31.634 --> 01:10:33.536]  I want to get into this, get into political correctness.
[01:10:33.536 --> 01:10:35.638]  I want to keep you for longer than 30 minutes if you can do it.
[01:10:35.638 --> 01:10:37.359]  No, I'm coming on your show in a few days.
[01:10:37.359 --> 01:10:42.984]  But just, it's going into overdrive, the desperation with this Russia crap.
[01:10:42.984 --> 01:10:45.746]  And I used to laugh at it, but man, I'm not laughing anymore.
[01:10:45.746 --> 01:10:50.991]  They have intelligence committee hearings, House committee hearings, and they say, Jones is a Russian agent.
[01:10:52.216 --> 01:10:55.097]  No proof, no judge, no indictment, no FBI at my office.
[01:10:55.097 --> 01:10:59.658]  Just total lies, like saying I'm an Easter Bunny from Pluto.
[01:10:59.658 --> 01:11:02.419]  And they go, well don't worry, we censored him at lunch.
[01:11:02.419 --> 01:11:04.699]  And it's just like, it's bizarre.
[01:11:04.699 --> 01:11:06.180]  It's not like even a movie.
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.720]  It's really happening.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.541]  You've been censored a lot.
[01:11:09.541 --> 01:11:12.381]  You were basically banned from being a comedian because of this.
[01:11:12.381 --> 01:11:15.182]  And they're just eating their own, but they never know when to quit.
[01:11:15.182 --> 01:11:16.383]  They're just getting crazy.
[01:11:16.383 --> 01:11:18.003]  Gavin McInnes, what do you think's going on here?
[01:11:19.249 --> 01:11:21.312]  Well, we're seeing the progression of lunacy.
[01:11:21.312 --> 01:11:28.322]  I mean, over the past year, it started with fake news, and then I stopped saying that because it wasn't just fake, it was deranged.
[01:11:28.322 --> 01:11:36.393]  So I called it mentally ill news, and now it's crazy ex-girlfriend news, where she goes, I know you were with that Russian chick.
[01:11:36.853 --> 01:11:37.994]  And you go, what are you talking about?
[01:11:37.994 --> 01:11:40.435]  I just went out for beers with Matt.
[01:11:40.435 --> 01:11:45.817]  Yeah, Matt was talking to someone else, talking to Alex, and Alex was talking to that Russian chick.
[01:11:45.817 --> 01:11:50.018]  So you're with her now, and you go, wow, you're deluded, lady.
[01:11:50.018 --> 01:11:51.759]  Please stop coming to my work.
[01:11:51.759 --> 01:11:55.020]  Please stop screaming at me about people you think I was with.
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.982]  Meanwhile, by the way, she's in bed with a Russian.
[01:11:57.982 --> 01:11:58.622]  Like, for all this
[01:11:59.122 --> 01:12:00.984]  Scrutiny, the left demands.
[01:12:00.984 --> 01:12:08.949]  You turn the tables to them and you point the mirror at them and we find out, oh, she's on Craigslist setting up Russian gangbangs.
[01:12:08.949 --> 01:12:12.292]  We've got Russians setting up ads on Facebook.
[01:12:12.292 --> 01:12:15.554]  We've got lies about the Trump prostitute dossier.
[01:12:15.554 --> 01:12:24.561]  So every time they get just a taste of what they put us through, they're exposed for the perverts and the colluders and the election riggers that they are.
[01:12:26.451 --> 01:12:31.535]  They got a lot of nerve though calling Rand Paul and Tucker Carlson Russian agents just because they disagree with them.
[01:12:31.535 --> 01:12:36.580]  I mean, where do you see all this going as they've, you're right, they've reached crazy ex-girlfriend level.
[01:12:37.602 --> 01:12:38.903]  They really have.
[01:12:38.903 --> 01:12:48.033]  The New York Post did a feature today about a threesome I had in 1994 saying that we're bragging about sexual encounters.
[01:12:48.033 --> 01:12:51.136]  Yeah, sorry I got laid when I was 24.
[01:12:51.136 --> 01:12:52.398]  I'm 47 now.
[01:12:52.398 --> 01:12:53.038]  Oh, the same thing.
[01:12:53.038 --> 01:12:55.781]  They're digging through everything in the world just looking for somebody to tell lies.
[01:12:55.781 --> 01:12:57.883]  And it's all like, Jones had a lot of girlfriends.
[01:12:58.524 --> 01:13:00.005]  I mean, it's like, what do they got?
[01:13:00.005 --> 01:13:00.725]  Nothing!
[01:13:00.725 --> 01:13:01.225]  Sorry!
[01:13:01.225 --> 01:13:04.807]  Steven Seagal was in the news today.
[01:13:04.807 --> 01:13:08.928]  In 1991, he asked a woman to sit on his face.
[01:13:08.928 --> 01:13:10.669]  Oh my God!
[01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:14.291]  Stop the presses!
[01:13:14.291 --> 01:13:15.151]  So where does it go?
[01:13:15.151 --> 01:13:17.732]  Because I asked you a year ago, I said, have we reached peak insanity?
[01:13:17.732 --> 01:13:18.872]  You said no.
[01:13:18.872 --> 01:13:20.133]  So when do we reach it?
[01:13:21.243 --> 01:13:33.927]  That's a great question, because I thought we were going through the normal stages of, what do you call it, death, despair, where it's denial, and then it's depression, and then it's anger, and it's acceptance.
[01:13:33.927 --> 01:13:35.488]  I forget the exact degrees.
[01:13:35.488 --> 01:13:38.949]  But we started out with those, but we didn't go to the next one.
[01:13:38.949 --> 01:13:42.850]  They just kept going on the crazy one, and it's gotten crazier and crazier.
[01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:44.411]  They're getting people fired.
[01:13:44.411 --> 01:13:45.491]  They're making up lies.
[01:13:46.071 --> 01:13:49.632]  I think the way it ends is riots.
[01:13:49.632 --> 01:13:52.773]  It really has to end there because there's no rationale here.
[01:13:52.773 --> 01:13:54.233]  They refuse to talk to you.
[01:13:54.233 --> 01:13:56.214]  They refuse to, you know, they hate free speech.
[01:13:56.214 --> 01:14:00.875]  They don't want to give Nazis a platform and the Nazi is anyone that likes Trump.
[01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:04.597]  So you go, well, I can't rational, I can't, I can't ration with you.
[01:14:04.597 --> 01:14:07.837]  You're out of your goddamn mind.
[01:14:07.837 --> 01:14:09.118]  I don't know what to do here.
[01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:13.922]  By the way, Nazis are making a comeback, not in the real world.
[01:14:13.922 --> 01:14:20.728]  All over Austin, I see Nazi symbols with X's through them, with people driving around in their cars like they're secretly Nazis.
[01:14:20.728 --> 01:14:24.091]  Meanwhile, it's a real live Nazi collaborator that's their main financier.
[01:14:25.253 --> 01:14:27.854]  George Soros, the guy who turned in Jews.
[01:14:27.854 --> 01:14:39.137]  And by the way, Ezra Levant has been in court ever since he wrote a 600 word article that basically just quoted George Soros from his books and said, this guy worked with the Nazis.
[01:14:39.137 --> 01:14:43.318]  And these useful idiots on the left, Soros just feeds them garbage and they go,
[01:14:43.658 --> 01:14:44.599]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:14:44.599 --> 01:14:46.360]  We want to destroy society.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.042]  We want to destroy families.
[01:14:48.042 --> 01:14:51.384]  We want kids to be little gay transsexuals.
[01:14:51.384 --> 01:14:53.566]  We want women to stop breeding.
[01:14:53.566 --> 01:14:55.908]  They have 20-year-olds tying up their ovaries.
[01:14:55.908 --> 01:14:59.050]  They got men getting vasectomies and then having parties.
[01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:02.053]  They're castrating men and then the men are celebrating.
[01:15:02.053 --> 01:15:04.074]  That's how brainwashed these globalists are.
[01:15:04.074 --> 01:15:07.257]  Then we bring in refugees that want to sabotage the country
[01:15:07.797 --> 01:15:19.868]  AJ+, which is from Qatar, a Muslim country, is sending in propaganda here with AJ+, and everyone is gobbling up, going, oh, the problem is Nazis, the problem is domestic terrorists.
[01:15:19.868 --> 01:15:23.411]  Just gobbling up these lies!
[01:15:23.411 --> 01:15:25.093]  It's amazing how gullible we are.
[01:15:25.093 --> 01:15:26.854]  Gavin McInnes is our guest.
[01:15:26.854 --> 01:15:28.676]  We're going to come back into whatever subject he wants.
[01:15:28.676 --> 01:15:30.678]  I've got a ton to cover, but he brought up
[01:15:31.778 --> 01:15:33.059]  Trying to sexualize children.
[01:15:33.059 --> 01:15:35.942]  We got footage this weekend that's up on Infowars.com.
[01:15:35.942 --> 01:15:43.409]  It's the most shocking I've ever seen, period, of a drag queen festival, but it wasn't really that.
[01:15:43.409 --> 01:15:52.257]  It was little kids with guys on stripper poles handing men money and tucking money into their waistbands and men naked posing with children.
[01:15:52.257 --> 01:15:53.058]  I'm not kidding.
[01:15:53.058 --> 01:15:53.559]  Stay with us.
[01:15:56.039 --> 01:16:02.561]  KD Armor has been on a mission to manufacture the most comfortable body armor on the market, and we've succeeded.

[01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:11.493]  And when we sell products at this lower price, we've got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation.

[01:19:27.604 --> 01:19:28.905]  Our probiotic.
[01:19:28.905 --> 01:19:29.385]  All of it.

[01:19:45.574 --> 01:19:47.615]  Doesn't matter, I just want you to see how great it is.
[01:19:47.615 --> 01:19:53.939]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast, America Rebirth and Renaissance with so much coming up today.
[01:19:59.154 --> 01:20:13.570]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:18.895]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:20:18.895 --> 01:20:21.178]  You're listening to Alex Jones!
[01:20:30.498 --> 01:20:35.524]  Gavin McInnes with the popular TV slash radio show on CRTV, conservative view television.
[01:20:35.524 --> 01:20:38.587]  You probably see the ads all over Drudge and all over the internet.
[01:20:38.587 --> 01:20:47.616]  It has a lot of viewers, a lot of listeners very excited about the expansion of what he's doing because those of us that have held on this long and had this much success
[01:20:48.758 --> 01:20:57.665]  Uh, are a rare breed, and that's why I just appreciate everybody is taking action and standing up for the truth, because we are in the fight of our lives.
[01:20:57.665 --> 01:21:00.528]  You were really boiling it down in a very eloquent way during the break.
[01:21:00.528 --> 01:21:01.949]  Will you repeat that, Gavin McInnes, for us?
[01:21:03.151 --> 01:21:06.793]  Well, first of all, this is all about power with the left.
[01:21:06.793 --> 01:21:13.317]  The reason that their message contradicts itself, when they say, we're feminists, then they have Linda Sarsour running the Women's March.
[01:21:13.317 --> 01:21:16.899]  She wants women to be second-class citizens, but she's the head of the march.
[01:21:16.899 --> 01:21:23.322]  Or they say, they love free speech at DePaul, yet they have Rasma Odeh, who
[01:21:24.901 --> 01:21:28.103]  Who was doing a fundraiser after killing two Israelis, yet they won't let me speak.
[01:21:28.103 --> 01:21:32.905]  So, their message keeps contradicting itself, and that's because it's not about the message, it's about power.
[01:21:32.905 --> 01:21:40.909]  That's why they don't want to debate you, or me, or Paul Joseph Watson, or Mark Dice, or any of the ad-pocalypse people like Lauren Southern.
[01:21:40.909 --> 01:21:42.389]  They want to shut us down.
[01:21:42.389 --> 01:21:43.930]  They want to control the narrative.
[01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:45.091]  They want power.
[01:21:45.091 --> 01:21:46.432]  They don't care about the message.
[01:21:46.432 --> 01:21:50.336]  That's also why they invite all these jihadists in, who are saboteurs.
[01:21:50.336 --> 01:21:59.464]  They know the jihadists are homophobes and sexists, but they go, at least like little gremlins, you'll get in and destroy my enemy, and then I can hold all the power.
[01:21:59.464 --> 01:22:00.585]  I can dominate.
[01:22:00.585 --> 01:22:01.646]  But here's what they don't get.
[01:22:02.296 --> 01:22:07.060]  We've been going through this crap for decades and decades.
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.622]  I've survived vice.
[01:22:08.622 --> 01:22:10.163]  I've survived political correctness.
[01:22:10.163 --> 01:22:12.705]  I've survived having my ad agency shut down.
[01:22:12.705 --> 01:22:14.467]  And all it's done is made us stronger.
[01:22:14.467 --> 01:22:15.868]  We're like Spartans now.
[01:22:15.868 --> 01:22:19.571]  It's sort of like, I don't know if you ever had a little brother, but I used to bully my little brother all the time.
[01:22:19.571 --> 01:22:22.093]  Just punch him in the arm and give him a charley horse.
[01:22:22.093 --> 01:22:24.956]  I didn't realize I was accidentally training a ninja.
[01:22:25.576 --> 01:22:30.280]  And by the time he was 16, he could beat the crap out of me.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:35.084]  And now, when we play this game, when we play pool, if you sink the white ball, you get to punch the other guy.
[01:22:35.084 --> 01:22:38.366]  When he punches me, it feels like I've been hit by a car.
[01:22:38.366 --> 01:22:40.668]  Like, I've turned him into a monster.
[01:22:40.668 --> 01:22:42.089]  And that's what they've done with us!
[01:22:42.089 --> 01:22:44.071]  They cannot shut us down!
[01:22:44.071 --> 01:22:46.793]  We are no longer a worthy adversary.
[01:22:46.793 --> 01:22:49.195]  We are superior to them.
[01:22:49.195 --> 01:22:51.697]  This is like... And it's because our audience... Our audience...
[01:22:51.857 --> 01:22:52.377]  I don't think so.
[01:23:16.610 --> 01:23:17.691]  Come on, let's go!
[01:23:17.691 --> 01:23:18.771]  I'm not backing off.
[01:23:18.771 --> 01:23:19.972]  I'm not shutting up, ever.
[01:23:19.972 --> 01:23:21.452]  Because that'd be like dying.
[01:23:21.452 --> 01:23:22.393]  I'm never giving up.
[01:23:22.393 --> 01:23:23.353]  I'm never getting in.
[01:23:23.353 --> 01:23:25.634]  Especially when we're starting to win so hard.
[01:23:25.634 --> 01:23:26.515]  Starting to win and all.
[01:23:26.515 --> 01:23:28.536]  Just a total victory.
[01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:29.876]  I'll fight to the death.
[01:23:29.876 --> 01:23:30.737]  They don't understand.
[01:23:30.737 --> 01:23:34.939]  All the people who were sort of on the fence, they booted those wimps out long ago.
[01:23:34.939 --> 01:23:37.100]  How does the poem go?
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:43.063]  The brave lack all conviction, yet the weak are full of passionate intensity, or the
[01:23:44.203 --> 01:23:46.325]  The wrong are full of passion and intensity.
[01:23:46.325 --> 01:23:50.068]  All the sort of people who weren't sure about what they were doing are long gone.
[01:23:50.068 --> 01:23:53.430]  It's sort of like the Scots after seven years of war with the English.
[01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:57.633]  The only ones that are left love conflict, love war.
[01:23:57.633 --> 01:23:58.934]  We enjoy all this.
[01:23:58.934 --> 01:24:03.998]  Like when we're on right-wing watch or media matters, that's a compliment to us.
[01:24:03.998 --> 01:24:05.579]  Don't you understand?
[01:24:05.579 --> 01:24:08.001]  The people scared of you are long gone.
[01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:11.504]  You only have the Spartans left and our swords are unsheathed.
[01:24:12.605 --> 01:24:21.095]  Well, what it comes down to is you're so committed, you've gone through so much, and you know how bad the enemy is, and you know you're on the right track, and you know you're not going to turn your children's future over to them.
[01:24:21.095 --> 01:24:24.219]  It's just an empowering feeling beyond hatred.
[01:24:24.219 --> 01:24:25.180]  It's love.
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:27.223]  It's love of our children, love of justice.
[01:24:27.223 --> 01:24:29.706]  We are just committed, and they can feel it.
[01:24:30.652 --> 01:24:37.658]  And children are a great... I'm glad you spent so much time talking about this drag show in Austin because the children are a focal point here.
[01:24:37.658 --> 01:24:42.842]  Maybe because we have kids and we know what a future means and we're concerned about grandchildren.
[01:24:42.842 --> 01:24:45.224]  Unlike Merkel, we have skin in the game.
[01:24:45.224 --> 01:24:47.706]  But these people, these childless hordes...
[01:24:48.226 --> 01:24:51.910]  They don't understand what children are like and they sit there saying they're sexual.
[01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:55.915]  Kids, a 10-year-old doesn't ask you about tits, okay?
[01:24:55.915 --> 01:24:58.498]  Sex isn't on their radar in any way.
[01:24:58.498 --> 01:25:02.823]  If you're watching a movie and there's a weird romantic scene, they just sort of go bleh.
[01:25:02.823 --> 01:25:05.266]  They don't go, hey dad, what's going on over there?
[01:25:05.646 --> 01:25:12.589]  But the way they sexualize these kids makes it clear to me that they don't have kids, they don't know kids, and that's really what's the plan of the goblets.
[01:25:12.589 --> 01:25:21.093]  Let's make these people childless and then we can start sabotaging children and we can start normalizing pedophilia and normalizing trans children.
[01:25:21.093 --> 01:25:22.394]  They're worse than saboteurs.
[01:25:22.394 --> 01:25:23.675]  They're like a virus.
[01:25:23.675 --> 01:25:25.335]  They're like a cultural plague.
[01:25:25.335 --> 01:25:34.140]  And by the way, even Camille Paglia, that is a real liberal and a lesbian, she says trying to sexualize kids and tell them they're another gender when they're five years old is serious abuse.
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:34.440]  It is!
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:37.562]  Yes, and they give them hormone blockers.
[01:25:37.562 --> 01:25:41.604]  Shane, when you give a kid hormone blockers, by the way, you don't just stop them from having pubes.
[01:25:41.604 --> 01:25:45.367]  You make that girl infertile for the rest of her life.
[01:25:45.367 --> 01:25:47.969]  And I imagine that you can't get a tattoo till you're 18.
[01:26:06.061 --> 01:26:07.242]  Well, you know what it is, too.
[01:26:07.242 --> 01:26:11.546]  It's weak white people who are ashamed of being white and they want some sort of culture.
[01:26:11.546 --> 01:26:17.012]  So they go, it's not okay to be white, you're terrible, you did slavery, you killed the Indians, your life sucks, you're a loser.
[01:26:17.012 --> 01:26:20.075]  And these wimps go, well, how can I get out of this mess?
[01:26:20.075 --> 01:26:21.216]  Well, be gay.
[01:26:21.216 --> 01:26:21.936]  I'm not gay.
[01:26:21.936 --> 01:26:22.737]  Well, be a race.
[01:26:22.737 --> 01:26:23.338]  I'm not a race.
[01:26:24.819 --> 01:26:25.960]  What if my kid's gay?
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.342]  What if I have a trans kid?
[01:26:27.342 --> 01:26:29.704]  Okay, then you're off the hook and you're in the in crowd.
[01:26:29.704 --> 01:26:30.265]  Yay!
[01:26:30.265 --> 01:26:31.626]  Here, Timmy, put on a dress.
[01:26:31.626 --> 01:26:34.749]  I've seen them do it to kids as young as one and two.
[01:26:34.749 --> 01:26:39.294]  Two-year-olds can barely talk and now you know that kid's a girl?
[01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:40.916]  You're a sick pig.
[01:26:40.916 --> 01:26:43.739]  Can you imagine how those children are going to rebel against that type of crap?
[01:26:44.805 --> 01:26:48.569]  In a way, they're starting an army for us.
[01:26:48.569 --> 01:26:56.617]  You're not going to get a more conservative kid than a boy who was adopted by two lesbians and keeps getting hammered about how he's a girl his whole life.
[01:26:56.617 --> 01:26:58.719]  He's going to be the head of the military.
[01:26:58.719 --> 01:27:00.280]  You're making a new Mad Dog right there.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:03.283]  A couple weeks ago, my wife had some family in town.
[01:27:03.283 --> 01:27:04.524]  They went out to this horse riding place.
[01:27:05.285 --> 01:27:07.026]  And it was a lesbian that ran it.
[01:27:19.561 --> 01:27:35.109]  My wife's niece, who's like 18, openly embossing the women around, it was her women family that came, and then she had like a son that was like a slave that she yelled at, who ran around hunchback, and then she would brag about how she had her son under her control.
[01:27:35.109 --> 01:27:44.854]  And she was just having kids to have slaves, and it's like you realize there's not just oppressors that come as heterosexuals, and a lot of the so-called lesbians, man, they are like running the women.
[01:27:45.734 --> 01:28:04.180]  Oh they have a brutal domestic abuse problem within their own community because what these what these butch dykes do is they want to be men but they end up being a caricature of men sort of like a 1950s guy so they'll have like a pompadour and sideburns a little thin mustache and a wife beater and they'll come home and go hey where's my lunch bitch
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.041]  Yeah, I'm a dude.
[01:28:06.041 --> 01:28:07.682]  I like to fix cars.
[01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:20.089]  By the way, I was playing pool one time with Shane Steiner and his wife, that's a beauty queen, and our kids, and we're playing pool by the bowling area in the video games, and there were actually little, like, 100-pound lesbians with duck's ass haircuts.
[01:28:20.089 --> 01:28:21.350]  It was actually real stylish.
[01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:25.372]  Cigarettes, white t-shirts, and they walked over and said, she's ours.
[01:28:25.372 --> 01:28:28.094]  And we started laughing, and they wanted to fight.
[01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:32.257]  Shane Steiner can literally bench press 400 pounds, like, 50 times.
[01:28:33.317 --> 01:28:33.598]  Okay.
[01:28:33.598 --> 01:28:34.720]  That's the problem with the left.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.581]  They want to beat us.
[01:28:35.581 --> 01:28:38.085]  We go, if you're us, you're going to get knocked out.
[01:28:38.085 --> 01:28:45.236]  But the guy who does jiu-jitsu three hours a day with Tim Kennedy is like, they're like starting fights with a guy that'll tear your arms out of your socket.
[01:28:45.885 --> 01:28:47.365]  That's the left in a nutshell.
[01:28:47.365 --> 01:28:51.887]  I'm literally chicks in fifties outfits coming over trying to muscle his wife.
[01:28:51.887 --> 01:28:54.247]  I'm like, dude, no dude would ever do that.
[01:28:54.247 --> 01:28:56.168]  Plus Donner looks like a gorilla.
[01:28:56.168 --> 01:28:57.048]  It's a no brainer.
[01:28:57.048 --> 01:28:59.429]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:28:59.429 --> 01:29:07.471]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?

[01:29:57.148 --> 01:29:57.648]  Not a group.
[01:29:57.648 --> 01:29:59.109]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:29:59.109 --> 01:30:00.429]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:30:00.429 --> 01:30:01.629]  Why is this so good?
[01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:06.911]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:30:06.911 --> 01:30:20.454]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:30:20.454 --> 01:30:21.815]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:30:22.595 --> 01:30:24.256]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:30:24.256 --> 01:30:26.817]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:30:26.817 --> 01:30:28.118]  These are all parasites.
[01:30:28.118 --> 01:30:29.239]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:30:29.239 --> 01:30:30.579]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:30:30.579 --> 01:30:35.062]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bug, the organic wormwood.
[01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:38.343]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:30:38.343 --> 01:30:41.425]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:30:41.425 --> 01:30:42.466]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:30:42.466 --> 01:30:44.387]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:33:18.154 --> 01:33:19.875]  Burning inside!
[01:33:19.875 --> 01:33:23.037]  Burning inside!
[01:33:23.037 --> 01:33:29.440]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Gavin McInnes.
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:30.481]  Hip!
[01:33:30.481 --> 01:33:31.221]  Hip!
[01:33:31.221 --> 01:33:32.962]  Hip!
[01:33:32.962 --> 01:33:37.985]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:43.674 --> 01:34:02.159]  By the way, when I see the Duck Dynasty guy, and I see Gavin, and I see all these other big people, with Levine, who I don't agree with him on everything, but at least he's pro-America, pro-free market, and now he's pro-Trump, setting up a big TV radio network and starting to get big TV affiliates and everything, just like we're doing as well, it is just exciting.
[01:34:02.159 --> 01:34:11.061]  I mean, I just want to, I want to have them so successful that I don't have to work 18 hours a day because I feel guilty in this fight if I don't, because
[01:34:11.801 --> 01:34:13.142]  We're nip and tuck here.
[01:34:13.142 --> 01:34:20.970]  We're on the verge of winning or losing everything, and when you really find out how crazy the enemy is, you realize how real this is.
[01:34:20.970 --> 01:34:28.757]  I'm going to go back to him in a moment, but when I described two years ago, whatever it was, I was at Main Events, the name.
[01:34:28.757 --> 01:34:34.342]  It's got video games and bowling and over by where the food's at and the bar's at.
[01:34:34.342 --> 01:34:36.785]  We were over there eating by the pool area.
[01:34:37.898 --> 01:34:59.773]  The little pool hall, and then literally these women came over in 1950s kind of grease outfits, had their hair done, ducks ass perfectly, everything, and were actually hitting on my friend's wife, and she started laughing.
[01:34:59.773 --> 01:35:04.517]  And then Shane and I couldn't even really say anything, because we started laughing
[01:35:05.717 --> 01:35:08.338]  But it was like they were in a trance of delusion.
[01:35:08.338 --> 01:35:12.279]  They kept still walking around right in front of us like they wanted to fight.
[01:35:12.279 --> 01:35:15.900]  Maybe 110 pound women.
[01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:21.041]  Wearing blue jeans, white shirts, cigarettes rolled up under their, you know, shoulder.
[01:35:21.041 --> 01:35:27.463]  And it was so weird that they were saying stuff to us and we couldn't even talk.
[01:35:27.463 --> 01:35:29.683]  We all started laughing.
[01:35:29.683 --> 01:35:30.524]  We were going to play pool.
[01:35:30.524 --> 01:35:32.064]  We just got done eating and we already played
[01:35:33.314 --> 01:35:34.974]  Bowling and video games.
[01:35:34.974 --> 01:35:35.875]  Did some rock climbing.
[01:35:35.875 --> 01:35:37.035]  They also have that there.
[01:35:37.035 --> 01:35:39.375]  We just left.
[01:35:39.375 --> 01:35:44.337]  So, you could say we got run off by two women dressed as men, but we didn't want a confrontation.
[01:35:44.337 --> 01:35:51.318]  Plus, it was so weird that they were so delusional that they thought they were gonna, like, take our woman or something.
[01:35:51.318 --> 01:35:54.359]  It was just, it's just next-level weirdness, folks.
[01:35:54.359 --> 01:35:57.620]  And just like Gavin McGinnis said earlier, if you understand that, you understand everything.
[01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:59.080]  Now, let me just stop right there for a moment.
[01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:01.832]  Tell you how we fund ourselves.
[01:36:01.832 --> 01:36:03.794]  We have a whole lot of Made in America t-shirts.
[01:36:03.794 --> 01:36:06.817]  We also have t-shirts made in Mexico if you want to pay $5 less.
[01:36:06.817 --> 01:36:12.342]  I leave it up to you with whatever you want to do.
[01:36:12.342 --> 01:36:19.228]  But they come in a nice packaging, nice folded up, very, very soft fabric, very, very high quality.
[01:36:19.228 --> 01:36:24.072]  This is the newest shirt that I want to be our bestseller that I personally wear around town now.
[01:36:24.072 --> 01:36:25.873]  It's my favorite shirt of all time.
[01:36:25.873 --> 01:36:27.515]  And it says, Won't Tread on Me.
[01:36:28.843 --> 01:36:31.965]  And it's got the Gadsden snake just simply as the snake.
[01:36:31.965 --> 01:36:40.549]  Very iconic with InfoWars.com in day glow yellow on the back and InfoWars.com the American flag on the right hand shoulder.
[01:36:40.549 --> 01:36:47.793]  Now it takes a lot of these obviously to be able to fund the operation but what it's really about is spreading the word.
[01:36:47.793 --> 01:36:48.894]  But it's a designer t-shirt.
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:55.844]  All of our t-shirts are $9.95, but for the really soft fabric and quality and made in America and all the rest of it, it's $24.95.
[01:36:55.844 --> 01:36:57.985]  But that purchase funds our operation.
[01:36:57.985 --> 01:36:59.466]  We got the ball caps, we got all of it.
[01:36:59.466 --> 01:37:02.148]  We were selling stuff for 50% off the last four days.
[01:37:02.148 --> 01:37:05.991]  We have to stop, because almost every shirt is sold out.
[01:37:07.346 --> 01:37:08.747]  You want to trigger globalists?
[01:37:08.747 --> 01:37:11.749]  Man, that is a lot of shirts hitting the streets.
[01:37:11.749 --> 01:37:15.912]  But on the average, we made about $3 because we had free shipping on the shirts as well.
[01:37:15.912 --> 01:37:17.233]  So you're selling shirts for $9.95.
[01:37:17.233 --> 01:37:19.235]  They cost you like five, six bucks.
[01:37:19.235 --> 01:37:20.315]  Then you do free shipping.
[01:37:20.315 --> 01:37:21.877]  I mean, you're losing money on some.
[01:37:21.877 --> 01:37:23.678]  So shirts are back to regular price.
[01:37:23.678 --> 01:37:26.020]  But this shirt had been sold out.
[01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:27.801]  It just came back in.
[01:37:27.801 --> 01:37:29.762]  What is the name of the shirt?
[01:37:29.762 --> 01:37:30.543]  I forget the name.
[01:37:30.543 --> 01:37:30.943]  There it is.
[01:37:30.943 --> 01:37:32.665]  Won't Tread on Me T-shirt.
[01:37:32.665 --> 01:37:34.466]  Oh, obviously, that's what it's called on the front.
[01:37:34.466 --> 01:37:35.687]  That's my favorite new shirt.
[01:37:36.815 --> 01:37:43.000]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:49.345]  And we're extending free shipping store-wide on everything but all those other specials on Super Bowl Vitality and all that.
[01:37:49.345 --> 01:37:53.308]  It basically is about to sell out, so we went back to regular price until more comes back in.
[01:37:53.308 --> 01:38:01.314]  Caveman is now 50% off, Ultimate Bone Broth Paleo Formula, Biome Defense, the amazing probiotic is 50% off, and a lot of other things.
[01:38:02.915 --> 01:38:07.719]  The older specials had to end, but we have some new specials that are only going for two days!
[01:38:07.719 --> 01:38:13.544]  Because we're so close to selling out Caveman, so close to selling out Biome Defense, you're like, well then why do the discount?
[01:38:13.544 --> 01:38:15.325]  I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[01:38:15.325 --> 01:38:17.267]  And we've got more coming in in two weeks.
[01:38:17.267 --> 01:38:20.950]  But I'm still holding the price, even though it's set to sell out in the next 24 hours.
[01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:24.553]  Biome Defense, InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or AAA253-3139.
[01:38:24.553 --> 01:38:25.774]  We also have InfoWars
[01:38:28.636 --> 01:38:32.379]  Store gift cards that are popular, that have five-star reviews.
[01:38:32.379 --> 01:38:38.783]  That way you give friends and family that at Christmas they come experience InfoWars and wake up.
[01:38:38.783 --> 01:38:40.064]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:38:40.064 --> 01:38:42.205]  Be sure and check those out as well.
[01:38:42.205 --> 01:38:43.906]  Okay, he's with us till the end of the hour.
[01:38:43.906 --> 01:38:47.329]  This is a short segment, longer segment coming up in a moment.
[01:38:47.329 --> 01:38:51.631]  He's with CRTV, Gavin McInnes, with his own daily transmission.
[01:38:51.631 --> 01:38:53.092]  It's so popular.
[01:38:53.092 --> 01:38:53.393]  Gavin.
[01:38:54.386 --> 01:38:56.930]  Getting back to that story and then expanding.
[01:38:56.930 --> 01:39:02.759]  You had an example, you texted me during the break, of popular culture that is a metaphor for what you're getting into.
[01:39:04.266 --> 01:39:11.448]  Well, yeah, there's this war on Apu right now, the East Indian gentleman who runs the Kwik-E-Mart and the Simpsons.
[01:39:11.448 --> 01:39:16.769]  So there's a problem with Apu, because that's a stereotype of an Indian.
[01:39:16.769 --> 01:39:21.870]  And if there's some Indian-American comedian who says, you know, I was bullied as a young boy.
[01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:25.371]  They would do his accent and they made me feel uncomfortable.
[01:39:25.371 --> 01:39:30.852]  And you go, wait a minute, Indian-Americans, not American Indians, but the brown ones, feather, dot, not feather.
[01:39:31.913 --> 01:39:36.216]  Are the most successful ethnic group in America, way over whites.
[01:39:36.216 --> 01:39:43.922]  So if you want to talk about privilege in America, then Indian Americans fit the criteria more than white people and a bunch of other races.
[01:39:43.922 --> 01:39:45.964]  Yeah, they're the 1% on average.
[01:39:45.964 --> 01:39:53.770]  They're the most successful of the Asian groups who sit six deep on top before you even get to whites.
[01:39:53.770 --> 01:39:54.631]  And you go,
[01:39:55.589 --> 01:39:57.113]  That's good, by the way.
[01:39:57.113 --> 01:39:57.875]  I like that.
[01:39:57.875 --> 01:39:59.359]  I like Indians coming in here.
[01:39:59.359 --> 01:40:00.602]  They don't steal our jobs.
[01:40:00.602 --> 01:40:01.865]  They tend to create new businesses.
[01:40:01.865 --> 01:40:04.070]  By the way, almost all the Indians I know are Trump supporters.
[01:40:05.011 --> 01:40:06.111]  Yes, yes.
[01:40:06.111 --> 01:40:07.632]  They're not jihadists.
[01:40:07.632 --> 01:40:10.212]  Their religion blends nicely with Christianity.
[01:40:10.212 --> 01:40:15.553]  There's no sort of fifth column going on where they refuse to learn our laws or our language.
[01:40:15.553 --> 01:40:17.034]  They even get our humor.
[01:40:17.034 --> 01:40:19.414]  They even seem to get how to riff properly.
[01:40:19.414 --> 01:40:20.555]  So, great asset.
[01:40:20.555 --> 01:40:23.615]  But stop complaining and whining.
[01:40:23.615 --> 01:40:26.076]  Groundskeeper, will he see my penance, by the way?
[01:40:26.656 --> 01:40:28.177]  Fair fae Scotland.
[01:40:28.177 --> 01:40:32.600]  I grew up with an accent and I was bullied when I emigrated to Canada.
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.481]  And guess what I thought that was?
[01:40:34.481 --> 01:40:34.681]  Good!
[01:40:34.681 --> 01:40:37.043]  Because I was getting in with the guys.
[01:40:37.043 --> 01:40:38.404]  I was getting bullied around.
[01:40:38.404 --> 01:40:39.884]  We were becoming a group.
[01:40:39.884 --> 01:40:42.366]  It was like an initiation into Canada.
[01:40:42.366 --> 01:40:45.128]  And within a week, I lost the time.
[01:40:45.128 --> 01:40:46.989]  And I said, hey, how's it going, eh?
[01:40:46.989 --> 01:40:48.950]  Oh, Maggie Longclaw's is pregnant.
[01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:50.411]  And I was right in with the group.
[01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:51.932]  It's called assimilation.
[01:40:51.932 --> 01:40:53.093]  Get over it, you pussies.
[01:40:54.764 --> 01:40:59.407]  Of course you can have fat bastard as well if you'd like.
[01:40:59.407 --> 01:41:01.167]  It's a fun accent.
[01:41:01.167 --> 01:41:04.249]  I don't think these people understand what we went through in the seventies.
[01:41:04.249 --> 01:41:08.952]  You would get an atomic wedgie for having glasses.
[01:41:08.952 --> 01:41:14.755]  Well that's part of the world and the idea that some group's going to represent you and control all language so you don't get bullied.
[01:41:14.755 --> 01:41:16.916]  How about getting bullied by the Thought Police?
[01:41:16.916 --> 01:41:20.598]  Facebook told us, they said, don't even use the word tranny.
[01:41:22.102 --> 01:41:24.184]  Even in a positive light, or you're just banned.
[01:41:24.184 --> 01:41:26.146]  They're like, that is the God word.
[01:41:26.146 --> 01:41:29.570]  And once I don't use that, well then now I can't use any word.
[01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:33.414]  And the truth is, I don't need to preface, I don't care what you're doing sexually, I'm a libertarian.
[01:41:33.414 --> 01:41:35.296]  But then I should be able to say whatever I want!
[01:41:35.296 --> 01:41:37.378]  I mean, look how it's ruining comedy!
[01:41:37.378 --> 01:41:41.142]  Everything's being ruined by these really Nazi thought police.
[01:41:41.883 --> 01:41:46.365]  And they're just throwing darts at a board when they decide who are these coveted groups.
[01:41:46.365 --> 01:41:47.025]  Trans?
[01:41:47.025 --> 01:41:49.246]  I remember trannies from the 90s.
[01:41:49.246 --> 01:41:54.448]  We used to go to this big gay rave called Black and Blue in Montreal because there's tons of chicks around, lots of faghags.
[01:41:54.448 --> 01:41:55.688]  Of course, that's where all the hot chicks are.
[01:41:55.688 --> 01:42:01.170]  Yeah, we would prey on these girls who were bored because no one was hitting on them and we didn't have any competition.
[01:42:01.170 --> 01:42:03.451]  It is true that the wildest chicks are faghags.
[01:42:04.164 --> 01:42:04.945]  I married one.
[01:42:04.945 --> 01:42:05.805]  It goes, it's great.
[01:42:05.805 --> 01:42:07.146]  I highly recommend it.
[01:42:07.146 --> 01:42:14.952]  But uh, we, I remember the trannies would be off in a corner and they were always on special K or meth and they would vomit on the ground and slip in.
[01:42:14.952 --> 01:42:16.173]  Exactly!
[01:42:16.173 --> 01:42:17.874]  Why are they always vomiting?
[01:42:17.874 --> 01:42:21.157]  If you mess with a tranny, they'd take off their shoes and they would hospitalize you.
[01:42:21.157 --> 01:42:24.139]  Oh, what is it about trannies are always like the toughest dudes?
[01:42:24.139 --> 01:42:24.699]  Yes.
[01:42:24.699 --> 01:42:24.899]  Yeah.
[01:42:24.899 --> 01:42:28.602]  Cause they got to fight every day with all the lunatics that surround them.
[01:42:28.602 --> 01:42:31.805]  We have a lot in common with the old school tranny come to think of it.
[01:42:31.805 --> 01:42:33.146]  We're both hardened brawlers.
[01:42:35.103 --> 01:42:36.945]  And again, everything we just said is true.
[01:42:36.945 --> 01:42:39.088]  Everybody knows it, who's been around.
[01:42:39.088 --> 01:42:48.220]  But it's supposedly hateful to say that, you know, it was well known back in the day that if you went to a rave, there'd be a bunch of hot chicks, and then you can pick up three of them if you wanted to.
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:50.223]  I mean, I just read that once.
[01:42:50.223 --> 01:42:51.324]  I just read that.
[01:42:51.324 --> 01:42:52.886]  We'll be right back with Gavin McGinnis.
[01:42:52.886 --> 01:42:53.327]  Stay with us.

[01:46:59.451 --> 01:47:02.113]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:12.839 --> 01:47:17.043]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news.
[01:47:17.043 --> 01:47:19.806]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:19.806 --> 01:47:22.008]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:47:22.008 --> 01:47:24.811]  Gavin McGinnis is our guest.
[01:47:24.811 --> 01:47:28.114]  And then in the next hour, I intend to cover news up with the phones up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:29.175 --> 01:47:32.278]  But seriously, I don't need to sit here and preface this.
[01:47:32.278 --> 01:47:34.079]  I was not brought up to be racist.
[01:47:34.079 --> 01:47:38.102]  I was not brought up to be against people that were gay or straight or whatever.
[01:47:38.102 --> 01:47:45.707]  And to me, people's sexuality was like one aspect, like they played baseball or, you know, they were, you know, a carpenter or they were into music.
[01:47:45.707 --> 01:47:48.129]  It was just like, I'm not sexually obsessed.
[01:47:49.266 --> 01:47:53.628]  You know, unless it's 10 o'clock at night and I'm getting to bed with my wife or whatever.
[01:47:53.628 --> 01:47:58.491]  And then to just see this continued obsession with sex, sex, sex.
[01:47:58.491 --> 01:48:00.412]  It's what perverts do.
[01:48:00.412 --> 01:48:05.174]  And then to just see everything territorialized and every racial or cultural group.
[01:48:05.174 --> 01:48:07.215]  And now they're saying math is racist.
[01:48:07.215 --> 01:48:09.677]  And, you know, years ago, Halloween's racist.
[01:48:09.677 --> 01:48:16.280]  And then setting up Play-Doh and crayons for people at college that get upset when they see a pocket constitution.
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:17.381]  We all laugh at it.
[01:48:18.223 --> 01:48:27.426]  But mental illness is being induced on these people, and I think overwhelmingly in a lot of documents show, by design.
[01:48:27.426 --> 01:48:35.128]  Gavin, what set this system up, this perpetual motion machine, and where does it really end?
[01:48:35.128 --> 01:48:37.769]  Because I asked you this earlier, and you kind of didn't get to it.
[01:48:39.335 --> 01:48:43.139]  What goes past, kind of like spinal tap, you know, 10?
[01:48:43.139 --> 01:48:43.919]  Why not just make it go to 10?
[01:48:43.919 --> 01:48:45.281]  Well, because it goes to 11.
[01:48:45.281 --> 01:48:47.623]  What's past 11?
[01:48:47.623 --> 01:48:53.148]  Now that they're dangerous, angry ex-girlfriend, what comes after that?
[01:48:53.148 --> 01:48:53.929]  Riots in the streets.
[01:48:54.665 --> 01:48:55.166]  Massive.
[01:48:55.166 --> 01:48:56.327]  I mean, we've already seen this.
[01:48:56.327 --> 01:48:59.089]  We've got a taste of this when Trump was elected.
[01:48:59.089 --> 01:49:00.010]  They were delirious.
[01:49:00.010 --> 01:49:10.499]  They were attacking people in Magahat, attacking 50% of the population because they believe this narrative that they created themselves, that everyone who doesn't agree with them is Hitler.
[01:49:11.099 --> 01:49:15.382]  And they have no interest in hashing out the nuance there.
[01:49:15.382 --> 01:49:17.603]  It's black and white, and they have to fight.
[01:49:17.603 --> 01:49:19.624]  And these people have never been in a fight.
[01:49:19.624 --> 01:49:24.407]  They laugh at the cops, they shove cops, and you go, have you been out of your house before?
[01:49:24.407 --> 01:49:25.648]  Have you been outside before?
[01:49:25.648 --> 01:49:27.850]  You can't shove a cop, dummy!
[01:49:27.850 --> 01:49:33.073]  No matter what has happened, the most you can do is seethe and hope to get justice later.
[01:49:34.311 --> 01:49:39.876]  I think it might be a genetically white trait, you know, this sort of self-debasement, this self-hatred.
[01:49:39.876 --> 01:49:46.822]  I was walking into my bar the other day, and I think people are starting to know who I am in my neighborhood, and so all the white people went, oh my god, that's the guy, blah blah blah.
[01:49:46.822 --> 01:49:55.530]  And then there was two black guys at the end, and they just looked at me, they had no clue who I was, and I thought, these white people are sort of offended on behalf of
[01:49:56.170 --> 01:50:01.512]  Gays, minorities, trans, but the gays, minorities, trans, the black people, they're not part of this thing.
[01:50:01.512 --> 01:50:03.353]  It's sort of like, let me give you another example.
[01:50:03.353 --> 01:50:09.896]  I work with this Russian guy and I said, I saw this kid wearing a hammer and a sickle and that must drive you nuts.
[01:50:09.896 --> 01:50:10.817]  You must hate that.
[01:50:10.817 --> 01:50:18.580]  So here I am getting mad on his behalf and he looks at me and he goes, why would I give a crap about a hammer and a sickle?
[01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:20.661]  I'm so glad to be out of that place.
[01:50:20.661 --> 01:50:23.682]  If someone wants to wear a communist pin, good for them.
[01:50:23.682 --> 01:50:25.043]  I could not care less.
[01:50:25.043 --> 01:50:25.423]  And I thought,
[01:50:25.883 --> 01:50:30.226]  Here I am, mad at this person on his behalf, and he doesn't care!
[01:50:30.226 --> 01:50:36.190]  There's something about white people, affluent, middle-class white people, where we're just like, can I have your problems?
[01:50:36.190 --> 01:50:38.111]  I want to do your problems for you.
[01:50:38.111 --> 01:50:55.423]  Well, isn't it that we got rid of Christianity and some of the extreme oppressive forms of it, and now the grandkids and children of very oppressive people that thought going to the bathroom was a sin, they now are just telling everybody else everything else is a sin, and they're basically the same kind of twisted Puritans that want to beat everybody over the head.
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:56.700]  Exactly.
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:58.820]  Well, Jim Goad calls them church ladies.
[01:50:58.820 --> 01:51:02.741]  Paul Joseph Watson, great video out now called the Sexual Puritans.
[01:51:02.741 --> 01:51:06.382]  They didn't abandon Christianity, they just changed its name.
[01:51:06.382 --> 01:51:11.783]  And now their religion is atheism and telling people what to do and looking down at everyone.
[01:51:11.783 --> 01:51:18.724]  I mean, they're really like the Catholic Church way before we had all this sort of 2.0 version.
[01:51:18.724 --> 01:51:21.884]  They want the Bible to be in Latin so the people can't read it.
[01:51:21.884 --> 01:51:23.025]  That's who they are.
[01:51:23.025 --> 01:51:25.705]  They're really these old school aristocrats.
[01:51:28.469 --> 01:51:33.816]  So much is going on.
[01:51:33.816 --> 01:51:34.778]  So many questions.
[01:51:34.778 --> 01:51:37.381]  What do you think about Trump 11 months in?
[01:51:37.381 --> 01:51:40.866]  I mean, as his presidency, it appears, starts to become really successful.
[01:51:42.029 --> 01:51:45.712]  They go into an even more hysterical spiral, but maybe we're seeing signs of sanity.
[01:51:45.712 --> 01:51:50.616]  Donna Brazile turning against him, a CNN host, Wolf Blitzer, many others.
[01:51:50.616 --> 01:51:52.938]  Chris Hayes turning against him, MSNBC.
[01:51:52.938 --> 01:51:59.343]  And now we see the real canary in the coal mine killing their ratings, absolutely dedicated to going after Trump.
[01:51:59.343 --> 01:52:04.367]  Now Saturday Night Live comes out and says, blow up the whole party, they're evil, they're bad, get rid of them.
[01:52:04.367 --> 01:52:05.789]  Donna Brazile's a hero.
[01:52:05.789 --> 01:52:08.631]  Is that an attempted makeover a few days late?
[01:52:09.468 --> 01:52:12.369]  They're imploding, but will the implosion ever end?
[01:52:12.369 --> 01:52:16.450]  It's sort of like an animal house where that guy's saying, everyone be calm!
[01:52:16.450 --> 01:52:18.390]  And everyone keeps running past him.
[01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:21.331]  I don't think that they'd even notice that they're on fire.
[01:52:21.331 --> 01:52:23.111]  They just keep getting nuttier and nuttier.
[01:52:23.111 --> 01:52:24.791]  And by the way, you ask where it ends?
[01:52:24.791 --> 01:52:26.992]  When Trump gets reelected.
[01:52:26.992 --> 01:52:28.852]  You thought 2008 was a meltdown.
[01:52:28.852 --> 01:52:30.053]  I mean, sorry.
[01:52:30.053 --> 01:52:31.393]  You thought last year was a meltdown.
[01:52:31.813 --> 01:52:43.761]  The next, after he wins in three years, you're going to see total and utter mania riding the streets, because they're going to get crazier and crazier as time goes on, because Trump keeps getting better and better.
[01:52:43.761 --> 01:52:51.305]  800,000 jobs, Dow soaring, none of these controversies are true, all the racist hate crimes turn out to be hoaxes.
[01:52:51.305 --> 01:52:59.851]  The more they try to find problems with him, the more we realize what a great president is, and instead of them going, oh jeez, I guess I was wrong, they're incapable of that.
[01:53:00.091 --> 01:53:05.735]  So the crazy girlfriend just keeps going crazier and crazier and crazier!
[01:53:05.735 --> 01:53:12.519]  That's the crazy thing about it is that they never admit they're wrong.
[01:53:12.519 --> 01:53:27.769]  That's true insanity and they just make up more and more fantastical lies and they see like all of America is like a real Dungeons and Dragons game and like Trump's the demon lord and they've got to kill him and you're like dude this isn't real.
[01:53:29.099 --> 01:53:33.842]  That's not how, I mean, a scientist has a hypothesis like, uh, life needs light.
[01:53:33.842 --> 01:53:36.703]  So if something is in a totally dark place, there can't be light.
[01:53:36.703 --> 01:53:41.246]  And that was an accepted belief in science for decades, I'm going to say hundreds of years.
[01:53:41.246 --> 01:53:47.229]  And then they started finding life forms embedded within rock that had never seen the light of day, but they're alive.
[01:53:47.229 --> 01:53:48.109]  And what did scientists do?
[01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:49.370]  Did they have a meltdown?
[01:53:49.370 --> 01:53:52.391]  Did they have November 8th, we're going to scream at the sky?
[01:53:52.391 --> 01:53:53.512]  Did they smash windows?
[01:53:53.512 --> 01:53:54.973]  They went, oh, chick, chick.
[01:53:55.473 --> 01:53:56.875]  Recalibrate.
[01:53:56.875 --> 01:54:00.498]  Turns out you can have life without light.
[01:54:00.498 --> 01:54:01.519]  That's what a scientist does.
[01:54:01.519 --> 01:54:03.802]  That's what any normal intelligent person does.
[01:54:03.802 --> 01:54:07.065]  Intelligence is being wrong because you're improving.
[01:54:07.065 --> 01:54:08.026]  It's like lifting weights.
[01:54:08.026 --> 01:54:11.029]  You're tearing away at the muscles so they rebuild stronger.
[01:54:11.029 --> 01:54:13.491]  But these people can't be wrong and that makes them dumber.
[01:54:14.352 --> 01:54:18.773]  Keep getting stupider and stupider and, you know, they go to college and they come out dumber than when they went in.
[01:54:18.773 --> 01:54:19.753]  They don't want to evolve.
[01:54:19.753 --> 01:54:27.735]  You know, I heard Sunny Johnson over at Breitbart and she said, look, if a guy gets arrested, he's in the hood, he goes to jail, he shouldn't be allowed to have a gun again.
[01:54:27.735 --> 01:54:29.895]  And then this guy called up and he goes, look, I'm a family man.
[01:54:29.895 --> 01:54:35.716]  I did my two years for having a legal gun, but my wife now can't have a gun in the house and we live in the hood.
[01:54:35.716 --> 01:54:38.017]  And she goes, after she thinks about it for a while, she goes, you know what?
[01:54:38.638 --> 01:54:39.859]  You're right, I'm wrong.
[01:54:39.859 --> 01:54:41.560]  I changed my mind about that.
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:46.743]  You should, after you do your time, be able to buy a gun, especially if you're a dad in the hood.
[01:54:46.743 --> 01:54:48.024]  She's smarter now.
[01:54:48.024 --> 01:54:48.984]  She's evolved.
[01:54:48.984 --> 01:55:01.932]  But the left devolves, and that might be why they love Islam so much, because with all this inbreeding and the first cousins, they seem to be the only culture in the world that manages to go backwards in time and devolve.
[01:55:01.932 --> 01:55:02.532]  It's true.
[01:55:02.532 --> 01:55:05.314]  Well, Gavin, pulling back from this,
[01:55:07.353 --> 01:55:08.533]  What's their ace in the hole?
[01:55:08.533 --> 01:55:15.555]  Because they have created a lot of really weak, dependent people that are so stupid, they don't know what's going on.
[01:55:15.555 --> 01:55:25.356]  Then you've got the pseudo-intellectuals that believe they're the intellectual elite, that's why they're so upset at us, taking back control from them just for the sake of sanity.
[01:55:25.356 --> 01:55:33.138]  I think when you talk about them wanting to blow up the whole system to get back at reality, I think that's really their ace in the hole.
[01:55:33.138 --> 01:55:35.338]  And I think we better be ready to deal with them.
[01:55:36.824 --> 01:55:43.327]  Look, our ace in the hole is free speech and getting the word out that this isn't about trans kids and this isn't about refugees.
[01:55:43.327 --> 01:55:45.388]  This is about sabotage.
[01:55:45.388 --> 01:55:51.751]  The reason they're normaling pedophilia right now is not because they think children are sexual, just because they want to wreck stuff.
[01:55:51.751 --> 01:55:53.512]  They want to see Rome burn.
[01:55:53.512 --> 01:55:59.275]  They want to burn America to the ground and they have no plan B. So we need to get the word out.
[01:55:59.275 --> 01:56:04.237]  As far as their strengths go, their strengths are that we tend to be weak.
[01:56:04.237 --> 01:56:05.938]  We haven't had a war in a long time.
[01:56:06.238 --> 01:56:24.609]  We tend to have gone soft, so when the crazy ex-girlfriend throws the brick through the window at your new job and the manager goes, sorry buddy, you're too expensive to keep here, I gotta keep replacing the glass, the employee just tends to go, yeah, okay, doo-doom, doo-doom, walks out of the place like Eeyore or something and says, that's life!
[01:56:24.609 --> 01:56:27.371]  We just keep getting these people that are too easily intimidated.
[01:56:28.407 --> 01:56:32.930]  You're absolutely right, we're out of time, but have you seen the footage of Mall of America yesterday?
[01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:35.031]  When the knifing attack happened from the Somali?
[01:56:35.031 --> 01:56:41.815]  And it's like 95% women in burqas, and looks like you're in Somaliland?
[01:56:41.815 --> 01:56:47.859]  It's like P. Diddy always said, Mo Muslims, Mo problems.
[01:56:47.859 --> 01:56:49.560]  What's the left's plan with this?
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:50.741]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[01:56:51.857 --> 01:56:52.897]  Sabotage!
[01:56:52.897 --> 01:57:00.860]  Dude, if you found out that there was smallpox, if the left found out that Republicans were buying smallpox blankets, they would be thrilled.
[01:57:00.860 --> 01:57:01.480]  They would donate.
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:08.503]  If you had a fund, and you said, I'm going to make smallpox blankets that say Trump on them, I guarantee you liberals would support that.
[01:57:08.503 --> 01:57:11.604]  They want us dead, as Ann Coulter said.
[01:57:11.604 --> 01:57:13.104]  They don't want to negotiate.
[01:57:13.104 --> 01:57:14.665]  They don't want to find middle ground.
[01:57:14.665 --> 01:57:17.065]  They want total and utter annihilation.
[01:57:17.065 --> 01:57:21.387]  And the poor Somalis from their own wrecked country, they're the dynamite.
[01:57:22.699 --> 01:57:23.741]  Dude, I've been to Israel.
[01:57:23.741 --> 01:57:29.969]  Muslims say, in Israel, they go, we're happier here in Israel, living in Israel, than we are living on the other side of the wall.
[01:57:29.969 --> 01:57:32.833]  We're safer under Jewish rule than we are under Muslim rule.
[01:57:32.833 --> 01:57:34.255]  No one likes living with Muslims.
[01:57:34.255 --> 01:57:35.036]  Not even Muslims!
[01:57:36.673 --> 01:57:38.475]  But now they've gotten here and are politically correct.
[01:57:38.475 --> 01:57:40.557]  Now they do have the ethos to be Muslim.
[01:57:40.557 --> 01:57:42.739]  They finally found their pride with the left.
[01:57:42.739 --> 01:57:43.960]  Gavin McGinnis, thanks for joining us.
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:44.621]  Wow.

[01:59:48.779 --> 01:59:51.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:55.396 --> 01:59:59.641]  These conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:59:59.641 --> 02:00:04.587]  But to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[02:00:04.587 --> 02:00:07.190]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[02:00:10.947 --> 02:00:11.287]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.287 --> 02:00:11.727]  Alex Jones.

[02:00:36.374 --> 02:00:37.615]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.615 --> 02:00:41.318]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:00:41.318 --> 02:00:43.200]  It's time to stop submitting in this charity!
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:45.722]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[02:00:45.722 --> 02:00:47.223]  I heard that on Alex Jones!
[02:00:47.223 --> 02:00:48.985]  InfoWars went even further.
[02:00:48.985 --> 02:00:52.348]  InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[02:00:52.348 --> 02:00:56.351]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[02:00:56.351 --> 02:00:57.913]  Nobody can dispute the fact
[02:00:58.593 --> 02:00:59.573]  At your own risk!

[02:01:02.835 --> 02:01:03.895]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[02:01:03.895 --> 02:01:04.555]  InfoWars.
[02:01:04.555 --> 02:01:05.456]  InfoWars.
[02:01:05.456 --> 02:01:08.037]  Right now the war is the InfoWars.

[02:01:21.702 --> 02:01:22.742]  I want freedom!
[02:01:22.742 --> 02:01:23.562]  That's what I want!
[02:01:23.562 --> 02:01:24.983]  And that's what they should want!
[02:01:26.590 --> 02:01:34.975]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:01:34.975 --> 02:01:39.117]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:01:39.117 --> 02:01:42.279]  I saw a video on Thursday night of Sean Parker.
[02:01:53.362 --> 02:01:56.964]  The former president of Facebook.
[02:01:56.964 --> 02:01:59.286]  Legendary hacker, computer programmer, you name it.
[02:01:59.286 --> 02:02:02.948]  A fella I got to meet once here in Austin.
[02:02:02.948 --> 02:02:08.252]  And he was saying, Facebook targets and exploits your weaknesses.
[02:02:08.252 --> 02:02:10.653]  It targets and exploits your psychology.
[02:02:10.653 --> 02:02:12.854]  It makes you depressed by design.
[02:02:12.854 --> 02:02:14.335]  And it's very, very evil.
[02:02:14.335 --> 02:02:16.497]  And we consciously knew this when we did it.
[02:02:17.097 --> 02:02:25.604]  That thought process was all about how do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible.
[02:02:25.604 --> 02:02:34.691]  And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever.
[02:02:35.491 --> 02:02:38.232]  And that's going to get you to contribute more content.
[02:02:38.232 --> 02:02:41.612]  And that's going to get you, you know, more likes and comments.
[02:02:41.612 --> 02:02:56.535]  It's a social validation feedback loop that it's like a, I mean, it's exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with because you're exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.
[02:02:56.535 --> 02:03:01.736]  And I just, I think that we, you know, the inventors, creators,
[02:03:02.749 --> 02:03:16.094]  You know, it's me, it's Mark, it's the, you know, Kevin Sisterman, Instagram, it's all of these people, understood this consciously, and we did it anyway.
[02:03:16.094 --> 02:03:30.599]  But to have Sean Parker, multi-billionaire, founder of Napster, one of the co-founders of Facebook and so many other big endeavors, who was so crazed when I met him, he wasn't on drugs, it was natural, super intelligence,
[02:03:32.708 --> 02:03:36.290]  That he just walked up to me and went, Alex Jones, I can't believe you're here.
[02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:45.154]  He was all, he goes, I'm leaving, and just ran down the hall, out the door, at a party I was invited to by a rock star.
[02:03:45.154 --> 02:03:52.777]  And that's just a funny little story cuz I said, well, I don't know what that guy's problem is, but okay, he ran from me like Casper the Friendly Ghost.
[02:03:52.777 --> 02:03:58.119]  Somebody sees a ghost, they run out the door so hard they just put a hole through the door and there's a silhouette of their body.
[02:03:58.119 --> 02:04:01.041]  But I don't need to believe Sean Parker.
[02:04:02.108 --> 02:04:06.509]  I read documents 20 years ago, and 10 years ago, and 5 years ago.
[02:04:06.509 --> 02:04:11.430]  I talked to former CIA section chiefs about this that were at MIT in the 70s.
[02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:20.452]  I did my research, because the elite acts like you're all idiots, or I'm an idiot, and that we won't actually go read what's been written in published books by them!
[02:04:20.452 --> 02:04:22.193]  People ask, how do I know all this stuff?
[02:04:22.193 --> 02:04:23.833]  Why does everything keep coming true I talk about?
[02:04:25.205 --> 02:04:30.189]  Why does the media create all these fake things I didn't talk about to attribute to me to try to make people not tune in?
[02:04:30.189 --> 02:04:33.992]  It's because I actually went and read what they said they were going to build.
[02:04:33.992 --> 02:04:35.673]  And here's the bad news.
[02:04:35.673 --> 02:04:37.835]  Most of it they've been able to do.
[02:04:37.835 --> 02:04:40.837]  The good news is, we now know they mean what they're saying.
[02:04:40.837 --> 02:04:42.198]  We can stop them.
[02:04:42.198 --> 02:04:43.319]  We have the intel.
[02:04:43.319 --> 02:04:48.483]  Because a long-term program like this can be stopped if you're aware of it, even on its final 20% or so.
[02:04:54.847 --> 02:04:59.213]  You go to InfoWarsTore.com and get game-changing, amazing products.
[02:04:59.213 --> 02:05:02.998]  We've been sold out of DNA Force for almost four months.

[02:05:39.388 --> 02:05:43.210]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[02:05:43.210 --> 02:05:43.970]  It is an act of war.
[02:05:43.970 --> 02:05:46.412]  It is an act of standing up.
[02:05:46.412 --> 02:05:51.975]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[02:06:05.788 --> 02:06:10.511]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:06:10.511 --> 02:06:16.435]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:06:16.435 --> 02:06:25.361]  I've had enough of these people.
[02:06:26.332 --> 02:06:31.856]  They're a bunch of Christian murderers, scum, and we're giant death factories keeping babies alive.
[02:06:31.856 --> 02:06:34.758]  They're selling their body parts.
[02:06:34.758 --> 02:06:37.480]  What more do you need to know about these people?
[02:06:37.480 --> 02:06:41.483]  I go out and face these scum.
[02:06:41.483 --> 02:06:44.285]  They literally crawl out from under us.
[02:06:44.285 --> 02:06:51.090]  They have green looking skin, and they run around screaming, we love Satan, we want to get babies.
[02:06:53.361 --> 02:06:55.442]  I killed my kids!
[02:06:55.442 --> 02:06:57.263]  He came, he saw, he died.
[02:07:09.289 --> 02:07:09.429]  Yeah.
[02:07:25.783 --> 02:07:30.605]  Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[02:07:30.605 --> 02:07:35.288]  There's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on his show frequently.
[02:07:35.288 --> 02:07:37.389]  He says, me and Hillary are demons.
[02:07:37.389 --> 02:07:39.389]  Said we smell like sulfur.
[02:07:39.389 --> 02:07:41.290]  Ain't that something?
[02:07:41.290 --> 02:07:44.272]  I have never seen or smelled any woman like that, ever.
[02:07:44.272 --> 02:07:45.752]  People are telling me she smells.
[02:07:45.752 --> 02:07:48.234]  Who could not notice someone who smelled that badly?
[02:07:48.234 --> 02:07:53.296]  In a booth and by a pot and a goblet, it's a hobbling round.
[02:07:54.492 --> 02:08:22.948]  My spirit gets close to that evil and I feel it go Ah, ah, ah Real stuff, self-centered crap We don't even notice And it's self-rising up against us Millions of pointed people Of the very worst type And I'm so pissed We're gonna stab your daughter at the mall
[02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:43.196]  Well, that's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[02:08:43.196 --> 02:08:46.178]  We were halfway into that video and it just got put out.
[02:08:46.178 --> 02:08:47.879]  I thought my audio went out in my ear.
[02:08:47.879 --> 02:08:53.242]  But I guess that's that new special version we just got of that song, isn't it?
[02:08:54.531 --> 02:08:58.613]  That's how a lot of those new special versions work.
[02:08:58.613 --> 02:09:01.474]  What's that?
[02:09:01.474 --> 02:09:04.095]  You were saying something to me?
[02:09:04.095 --> 02:09:04.855]  No, go ahead, Matt.
[02:09:04.855 --> 02:09:09.657]  Tell me what you were going to say.
[02:09:09.657 --> 02:09:10.817]  We got the rest of the song.
[02:09:10.817 --> 02:09:15.599]  Here it is, folks.
[02:09:15.599 --> 02:09:18.300]  That's even better.
[02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:22.522]  This is like some of the best footage we've ever had right here.
[02:09:23.268 --> 02:09:29.292]  In a moment I'm gonna play a special report before we go to break come back and open the phones up and take your phone calls titled
[02:09:49.983 --> 02:10:01.841]  Trump coup rollout criticized on the House floor and it's very very important since the computer choked up and we weren't able to play the
[02:10:05.177 --> 02:10:21.186]  I talked about Somalis stabbing and killing people at malls and other places on about a weekly basis in the United States and how usually the talking point that's given the police is, we love our Somalis, we love our Muslims too, oh they're so good, oh they're so sweet.
[02:10:21.186 --> 02:10:23.187]  That's actually a quote.
[02:10:23.187 --> 02:10:29.791]  And so I said it on air and then folks took my voice and manipulated it and made it a song like it was a joke.
[02:10:32.419 --> 02:10:40.664]  I usually don't even get to the latest Somali stabbing or shooting at a church or whatever, but I just thought today we would do that.
[02:10:40.664 --> 02:10:43.226]  But by today, it was already memory old.
[02:10:43.226 --> 02:10:44.126]  It was kind of like, what?
[02:10:44.126 --> 02:10:45.387]  There's a song about Somalis?
[02:10:45.387 --> 02:10:51.151]  And then I think they made a new version today that was just so fabulous that you just saw.
[02:10:51.151 --> 02:10:52.512]  But hey, it doesn't matter because
[02:10:53.911 --> 02:10:55.151]  I love my Somalis.
[02:10:55.151 --> 02:10:56.051]  I love my Muslims, too.
[02:10:56.051 --> 02:10:56.671]  Oh, they're so good.
[02:10:56.671 --> 02:10:58.192]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:10:58.192 --> 02:11:03.693]  But the toll-free number to join us on air is 877-789-ALEX.
[02:11:03.693 --> 02:11:07.453]  877-789-A-L-E-X is the number to join us.
[02:11:07.453 --> 02:11:08.714]  And I haven't gotten into U.S.
[02:11:08.714 --> 02:11:21.296]  news, political news, Judge Roy Moore news, one of those classic, see-I-told-you-so stories.
[02:11:21.296 --> 02:11:23.016]  Because here it is in the news today.
[02:11:24.497 --> 02:11:26.478]  Official dawn of the EU army.
[02:11:26.478 --> 02:11:35.864]  Brussels signs off a military plan and hails historic day without the UK and says they're going to invade countries that try to pull out now, kind of like Spain's doing to Catalonia.
[02:11:35.864 --> 02:11:37.785]  That's out of the express.co.uk.
[02:11:37.785 --> 02:11:38.005]  That's 2017.
[02:11:38.005 --> 02:11:41.967]  We've got articles 2016 and 2015 and others where we told you about the secret army.
[02:11:48.971 --> 02:11:53.295]  And they even had articles in the news saying, look at Jones and his fake news.
[02:11:53.295 --> 02:12:01.483]  The Germans are launching a secret army via the EU, just like they did violating the Versailles Treaty in the 30s.
[02:12:01.483 --> 02:12:02.584]  And they're doing it again.
[02:12:02.584 --> 02:12:04.045]  A secret army.
[02:12:04.045 --> 02:12:06.567]  I'm not bashing Germans themselves.
[02:12:06.567 --> 02:12:08.249]  I'm part German.
[02:12:08.249 --> 02:12:11.752]  The point is that
[02:12:13.246 --> 02:12:21.310]  It's going on, and we told you it was coming, and now here's the EU army that says we try to leave, they'll just take over with their EU army.
[02:12:21.310 --> 02:12:31.135]  Which is called martial law, it's called invasion, it's called World War 2 Part 2, Part 2 of 2.
[02:12:31.135 --> 02:12:37.038]  European Union army set for creation, UK defund despite Brexit.
[02:12:38.029 --> 02:12:40.750]  Clifford Cunningham gives you the rest of the story.
[02:12:40.750 --> 02:12:44.691]  So you get today's news a year early.
[02:12:44.691 --> 02:12:46.451]  November 22nd, 2016.
[02:12:46.451 --> 02:12:49.832]  That's a little less than a year.
[02:12:49.832 --> 02:12:50.952]  Look at that.
[02:12:50.952 --> 02:12:58.034]  You get today's news 360 days early.
[02:12:58.034 --> 02:12:59.454]  Look right here.
[02:12:59.454 --> 02:13:01.095]  It's in the news today.
[02:13:01.095 --> 02:13:01.915]  It's official.
[02:13:01.915 --> 02:13:05.176]  Dawn of the UU Army.
[02:13:05.176 --> 02:13:06.396]  We told you about 10 years ago.
[02:13:08.123 --> 02:13:14.788]  If you ask why they hate us, for all of my issues, we're fearless.
[02:13:14.788 --> 02:13:15.869]  We're not pedophiles.
[02:13:15.869 --> 02:13:17.811]  We don't worship Satan.
[02:13:17.811 --> 02:13:19.112]  We want you to have a great life.
[02:13:19.112 --> 02:13:20.553]  We want a great life, by the way.
[02:13:20.553 --> 02:13:23.735]  Try to run our life, we'll fight you.
[02:13:23.735 --> 02:13:26.477]  And we're here to fight.
[02:13:26.477 --> 02:13:28.058]  We're here to not roll over.
[02:13:28.058 --> 02:13:29.219]  We're not taking it laying down.
[02:13:29.219 --> 02:13:31.501]  And that's the end of it.
[02:13:31.501 --> 02:13:32.581]  We don't care what you do to us.
[02:13:32.581 --> 02:13:33.262]  We're coming after you.
[02:13:34.952 --> 02:13:43.459]  So, we're like heat-seeking missiles or radar guided.
[02:13:43.459 --> 02:13:46.942]  We hone in on your radar or your heat signal.
[02:13:46.942 --> 02:13:53.967]  So when you're firing at us, that's what we hone in on.
[02:13:53.967 --> 02:14:00.132]  And we try to dodge the projectiles as we're coming in, as they're flying past.
[02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:01.653]  But it really doesn't matter because if you hit us,
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:07.921]  That just makes more missiles hone in, and then form in.
[02:14:07.921 --> 02:14:09.921]  The big phalanx, and it's just coming.
[02:14:09.921 --> 02:14:10.781]  It's coming.
[02:14:10.781 --> 02:14:20.883]  And they can see it, and they know it, and they can feel the will, and they can feel the destiny, and they know that we're not gonna give up.
[02:14:20.883 --> 02:14:23.124]  They know that we're not gonna back down.
[02:14:23.124 --> 02:14:24.724]  They know that we're committed.
[02:14:24.724 --> 02:14:28.345]  They're pure Satan-worshipping pedophiles and criminals.
[02:14:28.345 --> 02:14:29.805]  They have their purity.
[02:14:29.805 --> 02:14:30.625]  We have our purity.
[02:14:33.476 --> 02:14:39.941]  And that's why they always try to keep us asleep and then suppress us while we were asleep to get their dirty deeds done then.
[02:14:39.941 --> 02:14:52.831]  But now they've got a whole nother can of worms, kettle of fish, car full of clowns.
[02:14:52.831 --> 02:14:55.473]  They got a big problem.
[02:14:55.473 --> 02:14:57.395]  And it's just going to get worse.
[02:14:58.677 --> 02:15:27.444]  Because they've had generations mesmerized by the dum-dum tube, mesmerized by the smartphones, but see, a large contingent, a large segment, a large remnant, a large community of people of every color, but all one human race, who have a spirit that wants freedom, are becoming stronger and stronger.
[02:15:28.542 --> 02:15:30.043]  And stronger.
[02:15:30.043 --> 02:15:31.704]  And stronger under the pressure.
[02:15:31.704 --> 02:15:35.747]  Many are becoming screen sickness, smartphone zombies.
[02:15:35.747 --> 02:15:40.731]  I don't know if I coined that ten years ago or was it Mark Dice, it doesn't matter.
[02:15:40.731 --> 02:15:43.733]  Now Wikipedia says it's a term, so it's real.
[02:15:43.733 --> 02:15:45.675]  All hail Wikipedia!
[02:15:45.675 --> 02:15:47.456]  All hail the left!
[02:15:47.456 --> 02:15:50.518]  All hail the controllers of words!
[02:15:50.518 --> 02:15:52.700]  Our masters, our kings, our majesties!

[02:17:55.422 --> 02:17:58.545]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:17:58.545 --> 02:18:05.972]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[02:18:05.972 --> 02:18:11.597]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:18:12.337 --> 02:18:20.004]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:18:20.004 --> 02:18:27.871]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:18:28.611 --> 02:18:33.675]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[02:18:33.675 --> 02:18:35.817]  They are the anti-liberals.

[02:19:57.424 --> 02:20:00.046]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:27.557 --> 02:20:28.558]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:20:28.558 --> 02:20:33.301]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:20:33.301 --> 02:20:43.247]  I feel guilty on this broadcast today that I have not spent more time on this or been more upset.
[02:20:43.247 --> 02:20:51.232]  And then I love the leftist, Artie on Infowars.com, saying, Alex, you're a libertarian.
[02:20:51.232 --> 02:20:53.113]  Why are you being bigoted?
[02:20:54.577 --> 02:21:13.020]  I was reading, I've got a computer right over here, I've got my little smartphone, smaller computer, smaller screen, and I was reading comments in the article, in the video by Millie Weaver, Drag Queen Festival in Austin promotes early sexualization of children, gender confusion.
[02:21:13.020 --> 02:21:16.021]  I mean that's a totally true headline.
[02:21:16.021 --> 02:21:18.761]  A TT.
[02:21:18.761 --> 02:21:21.762]  And we got stuff we haven't even put out.
[02:21:23.959 --> 02:21:35.963]  Because it's police department type stuff.
[02:21:35.963 --> 02:21:49.008]  And then we know we're gonna be attacked for saying, hey man, it's not good to have a guy completely naked except for glitter glued to his member.
[02:21:50.009 --> 02:21:56.313]  It's one thing, people go down to Cancun for spring break and they're all above 18 and the women put glitter on, the guys do it, you run around the beach.
[02:21:56.313 --> 02:21:57.894]  I mean, that's, you're an adult.
[02:21:57.894 --> 02:22:00.515]  People can morally say that's wrong if they want to.
[02:22:00.515 --> 02:22:06.879]  You know, you better watch out, better wear a condom, but you're adults.
[02:22:06.879 --> 02:22:19.607]  Millie Weaver and Gavin Wintz go down to this thing that's open to the public at a hotel and I mean, it's naked men walking around with glitter glued to their, their Johnson.
[02:22:21.749 --> 02:22:32.058]  And then you got men on their knees shaking their hips with little kids coming up and giving them $5 bills and $10 bills.
[02:22:32.058 --> 02:22:36.422]  And they hide behind, what, you're not anti-drag queen?
[02:22:36.422 --> 02:22:39.905]  You're not anti-gay, are you?
[02:22:39.905 --> 02:22:43.448]  Again, we're the Open Free West where we don't kill gays.
[02:22:44.597 --> 02:23:04.490]  I literally don't hate people for their sexual persuasion, but I don't need to say, hey, before I show you men on strip bars with little girls giving them money, little boys giving them money, in some weird, weird conditioning operation, let me just say I'm not anti, see how you have to preface that?
[02:23:04.490 --> 02:23:08.452]  That's wrong!
[02:23:08.452 --> 02:23:12.575]  Since I was aware of this video, I've been very upset because I have four children.
[02:23:14.364 --> 02:23:18.268]  And I've seen the raw footage that I don't think we can put on here.
[02:23:18.268 --> 02:23:27.736]  I don't think what they had at a public event in a hotel ballroom in Austin, Texas, I can't put it on Facebook or Twitter or YouTube.
[02:23:27.736 --> 02:23:39.367]  By their rules and by my own morality, I mean, you go to the beach, you're driving down the beach, you see a man and a woman, arms around each other, touching each other, you know they're romantic.
[02:23:40.236 --> 02:23:47.318]  We got footage of six, seven, eight year old kids, man, in romantic embraces with full grown men.
[02:23:47.318 --> 02:23:49.819]  And all this weird sexual stuff with kids.
[02:23:49.819 --> 02:23:56.081]  And it is just, they're pushing the envelope on purpose.
[02:23:56.081 --> 02:23:57.122]  And it's in a hotel.
[02:23:57.122 --> 02:24:01.023]  I mean, can you imagine?
[02:24:01.023 --> 02:24:03.424]  And it's the fact that it's out in the open.
[02:24:08.649 --> 02:24:19.819]  And that people like Camille Paglia, who's a classical liberal and a lesbian, has been criticized for saying, you try to confuse a three-year-old's sexuality with a five-year-old's, that's child abuse.
[02:24:19.819 --> 02:24:20.220]  It is!
[02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:21.381]  They're not involved in that.
[02:24:21.381 --> 02:24:23.303]  They're going to have their natural proclivity.
[02:24:24.474 --> 02:24:31.342]  Somebody like a Catholic priest swooping in or whatever to have sex with a six-year-old, that is abusive and is pedophilia and is wrong.
[02:24:31.342 --> 02:24:41.034]  And all of these creepy-ass cults of children and these shows, a lot of parents bring their kids there and want them to be famous.
[02:24:41.034 --> 02:24:43.156]  But then you've got a little boy dressed as a girl
[02:24:44.249 --> 02:24:54.918]  Taking off their tutu and throwing it to the crowd and then getting money for people for being paid for sexually being provocative, which is beyond the gateway.
[02:24:54.918 --> 02:24:55.858]  It's how it begins.
[02:24:55.858 --> 02:25:03.024]  You know, you go to a topless bar to give women money to see what they like, and most of them are prostitutes.
[02:25:03.024 --> 02:25:04.385]  You're finding out their price.
[02:25:04.385 --> 02:25:06.487]  I mean, that's what topless bars are.
[02:25:06.487 --> 02:25:07.448]  Let's not lie about it.
[02:25:11.567 --> 02:25:16.430]  And I am not into the exploitation of women, so I am not into that.
[02:25:16.430 --> 02:25:18.251]  And I don't just say that as some term.
[02:25:18.251 --> 02:25:21.973]  I want a woman to really like me and really want me.
[02:25:21.973 --> 02:25:38.363]  I do not want to go in some 21st century version of a slave auction, and you got a woman up there on the slave platform, literally on a pole, showing you her goods like they do in North Africa, in Somalia, or other areas today.
[02:25:39.488 --> 02:25:45.729]  And I get, the hunted are the hunted, and the hunters are the hunted.
[02:25:45.729 --> 02:25:56.292]  I mean, I get a lot of the women are predatory, but creating that system makes a woman predatory, when women are the opposite of that, historically.
[02:25:56.292 --> 02:26:03.793]  It's a mess, it's a mess, it's a mess, it's a mess, it's a mess.
[02:26:03.793 --> 02:26:06.514]  Men having sex with women who they're not in love with
[02:26:08.666 --> 02:26:11.367]  Dehumanizes, and is empty, and is bad.
[02:26:11.367 --> 02:26:14.048]  But you're adults, you can do it.
[02:26:14.048 --> 02:26:31.075]  Children being brought in, and children doing strip teases for money, and children running up and giving men, dressed as women, humping the ground money, is an abomination.
[02:26:31.075 --> 02:26:37.097]  By every yardstick, and it just shows the tolerance of America has gone way off the edge.
[02:26:38.723 --> 02:26:47.392]  Everyone's tolerance, but notice it's gotten so tolerant that the mentally ill left tells heterosexuals, you're bad.
[02:26:47.392 --> 02:26:48.633]  Nuclear families, you're bad.
[02:26:49.653 --> 02:26:51.094]  People they call straight or bad.
[02:26:51.094 --> 02:27:06.222]  Every show on Netflix is calling for Communist Revolution or every episode Stranger Things, you name it, is all anti-nuclear family, anti-male and female, anti... And then they call the little girl that was 12 when they shot it, now 13, the sexiest woman in Hollywood.
[02:27:06.222 --> 02:27:11.805]  I mean, it's just everything is about debasing the youth.
[02:27:15.470 --> 02:27:21.773]  And if I was a dark alien force trying to sabotage humanity, I would get into the seed stock.
[02:27:21.773 --> 02:27:24.894]  I would target the babies.
[02:27:24.894 --> 02:27:25.915]  And that's what they've done.
[02:27:25.915 --> 02:27:32.998]  And you've got these drugged out, crazy, poor, sad people, most of which are in the sex industry.
[02:27:34.468 --> 02:27:37.730]  That are trannies and transvestites, transsexuals, all that.
[02:27:37.730 --> 02:27:38.870]  I mean, it's a meat grinder.
[02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:43.333]  Highest level of suicide, highest level of depression, hormones.
[02:27:43.333 --> 02:27:51.617]  The whole thing started as a CIA, Tavistock Institute program 40 years ago to see if they could really screw up humanity.
[02:27:51.617 --> 02:27:55.419]  I don't hate these people.
[02:27:55.419 --> 02:27:56.459]  They're victims.
[02:27:56.459 --> 02:28:03.143]  But just like a kid that was kidnapped when they were 5, at age 10, they're driving along in the ice cream truck, one of the other kids in the vehicle.
[02:28:04.011 --> 02:28:09.199]  They're now on the Anglerfish.
[02:28:09.199 --> 02:28:11.061]  They're the light.
[02:28:11.061 --> 02:28:16.329]  The young children are the young light that the Anglerfish hangs out in front.
[02:28:16.329 --> 02:28:18.833]  The other little fishies just swim up towards the white van.
[02:28:20.424 --> 02:28:26.027]  And if you want to see the mascot of the New World Order, let's pull up an anglerfish, can't we?
[02:28:26.027 --> 02:28:29.789]  The thing that should not be, but is at over 10,000 feet in the ocean.
[02:28:29.789 --> 02:28:32.190]  That evil, satanic creature.
[02:28:32.190 --> 02:28:35.572]  The light of an angel, right out front, masquerading as angel light.
[02:28:35.572 --> 02:28:36.973]  It's cute, it's fun, it's liberal.
[02:28:36.973 --> 02:28:39.674]  Just come close, and right there are the jaws.
[02:28:39.674 --> 02:28:41.095]  Come on in.
[02:28:41.095 --> 02:28:42.616]  Come on in.
[02:28:42.616 --> 02:28:45.037]  Come on in-y, come on in-y.
[02:28:45.037 --> 02:28:46.738]  We'll be right back in bullwars.com.
[02:28:46.738 --> 02:28:47.118]  Stay with us.

[02:29:07.357 --> 02:29:12.242]  Portable solar generators provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:29:12.862 --> 02:29:22.605]  And, unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no dangerous fumes, and produces an endless supply of electricity from the sun.
[02:29:22.605 --> 02:29:26.666]  It's like having an electric power plant running secretly in your own home.
[02:29:26.666 --> 02:29:30.187]  Right now, get a $5,000 solar generator for just
[02:29:30.607 --> 02:29:33.591]  $995 while supplies last.

[02:30:41.232 --> 02:30:43.813]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.

[02:30:55.558 --> 02:30:58.699]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:30:58.699 --> 02:31:06.142]  That's why now more than ever we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[02:31:06.142 --> 02:31:11.725]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:31:12.505 --> 02:31:20.172]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:31:20.172 --> 02:31:28.039]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:31:28.759 --> 02:31:33.822]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[02:31:33.822 --> 02:31:35.963]  They are the anti-liberals.
[02:31:35.963 --> 02:31:49.349]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:32:43.761 --> 02:32:45.201]  That means it's clean.
[02:32:45.201 --> 02:32:46.322]  That means it's pure.
[02:32:46.322 --> 02:32:49.222]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[02:32:49.222 --> 02:32:52.023]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:32:52.023 --> 02:32:57.444]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:32:57.444 --> 02:33:05.686]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:05.686 --> 02:33:06.826]  We want yours!
[02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:27.399]  All right, I'm going to your phone calls here, interspersing it with some other news.
[02:33:27.399 --> 02:33:32.643]  Man, you look at the classic racism being spewed by corporate media.
[02:33:32.643 --> 02:33:34.284]  It's meant to make white people racist.
[02:33:34.284 --> 02:33:38.888]  It's not going to work.
[02:33:38.888 --> 02:33:41.189]  But here's Daily Caller.
[02:33:41.189 --> 02:33:42.831]  Professor, it's not okay to be white.
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:47.243]  Because people are starting to come out and say, hey it's okay to be white.
[02:33:47.243 --> 02:33:51.207]  Two weeks ago I said we got new t-shirts coming out that say it's okay to be white.
[02:33:51.207 --> 02:33:55.832]  Then it says it's okay to be black, it's okay to be red, it's okay to be brown, it's okay to be pink.
[02:33:55.832 --> 02:33:56.873]  It's great to be human.
[02:33:59.022 --> 02:34:03.525]  So those t-shirts are coming out very, very soon, but this is just in the WikiLeaks.
[02:34:03.525 --> 02:34:06.047]  I keep going back to that, not for lack of news.
[02:34:06.047 --> 02:34:08.688]  I have too much new news and incredible stuff to cover.
[02:34:08.688 --> 02:34:13.712]  It's just, they're in there, and the Democratic Party's saying, we need race war.
[02:34:13.712 --> 02:34:14.753]  We need culture war.
[02:34:14.753 --> 02:34:16.354]  That's all we've got.
[02:34:16.354 --> 02:34:18.955]  We gotta stop prosperity.
[02:34:18.955 --> 02:34:21.897]  We gotta keep people poor so we can run their lives.
[02:34:21.897 --> 02:34:24.519]  That's evil.
[02:34:24.519 --> 02:34:28.462]  It's one thing if I got something and you wanna take it away from me, and then I crush you.
[02:34:29.445 --> 02:34:31.146]  I mean, I'll do that.
[02:34:31.146 --> 02:34:33.467]  I don't feel guilt about that.
[02:34:33.467 --> 02:34:46.015]  But if I went and tried to take something that was somebody else's, or I was jealous of them, or I wanted to make somebody low so I felt big, that doesn't make me feel big, that makes me feel small!
[02:34:46.015 --> 02:34:54.420]  Just watching the globalists get mad at everybody who wants everybody to be successful makes me so upset.
[02:34:54.420 --> 02:34:58.262]  And I'm not going to sit here and virtue signal, because for me it's not virtue signaling.
[02:35:01.249 --> 02:35:07.391]  I told you back when it happened a month ago, it was so obvious the way the Air Force General rolled it out, the way the media picked it up.
[02:35:07.391 --> 02:35:09.571]  Somebody said, you know, get out of here, N-word.
[02:35:09.571 --> 02:35:10.491]  It was all fake.
[02:35:10.491 --> 02:35:18.753]  And by the way, they've not prosecuted or gotten in trouble, the cadet that did it.
[02:35:18.753 --> 02:35:20.914]  And that's because that cadet didn't do it.
[02:35:20.914 --> 02:35:25.855]  Just like I said, back at the time, I said, if they catch them, they're going to blame it on a minority.
[02:35:25.855 --> 02:35:28.536]  I said, folks, it isn't a minority.
[02:35:28.536 --> 02:35:29.956]  Let me tell you how the globalists operate.
[02:35:31.994 --> 02:35:35.236]  You think a minority student really wants to go around and stir that up and do it?
[02:35:35.236 --> 02:35:36.877]  No.
[02:35:36.877 --> 02:35:39.378]  They want to belong.
[02:35:39.378 --> 02:35:40.339]  I've studied these cases.
[02:35:40.339 --> 02:35:42.700]  I've seen the MO, the way the rollout came out.
[02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:48.963]  Sometimes individuals do false flags, but generally it's somebody above them and somebody who's already in trouble gets burned for it.
[02:35:48.963 --> 02:35:56.888]  But notice they won't say who did it.
[02:35:56.888 --> 02:35:57.628]  That's because they did it.
[02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:07.691]  And notice the media, when I said that on Friday and on Sunday and today, never attacked me for it.
[02:36:07.691 --> 02:36:13.092]  I've called out the General, the three-star General, and I think he did it.
[02:36:13.092 --> 02:36:17.674]  I know his past, I know who he is, and I also happen to have sources.
[02:36:17.674 --> 02:36:19.274]  So you're smart, aren't you, General?
[02:36:19.274 --> 02:36:24.395]  You didn't take the bait, did you, punk?
[02:36:24.395 --> 02:36:27.917]  I wish you'd take more bait.
[02:36:27.917 --> 02:36:29.237]  We'll get you, don't you worry!
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:40.725]  Look, let's hear a few minutes of this fake of fakes with all his social engineer SJWs, most of them who are in on it.
[02:36:40.725 --> 02:36:49.772]  They want to call in this multi-racial group of red-blooded Americans who are one race and beat them over the head that they're racist when they're not even thinking about it.
[02:36:49.772 --> 02:36:54.116]  They're actually scared because the group is unified.
[02:36:54.116 --> 02:36:59.059]  The WikiLeaks explains what we already knew, the Tavistock Institute and the CIA documents.
[02:36:59.059 --> 02:37:02.002]  They're upset that we're all syncing up and getting along.
[02:37:02.002 --> 02:37:03.143]  They don't know what to do!
[02:37:05.233 --> 02:37:06.233]  So what does he do?
[02:37:06.233 --> 02:37:17.378]  He injects a bunch of race crap and doesn't think we couldn't tell that he was in the middle of the NFL scandal wanting to look like a hero injecting themselves with their SJWs.
[02:37:17.378 --> 02:37:18.299]  Then we're going to your phone calls.
[02:37:18.299 --> 02:37:18.619]  Here it is.
[02:37:19.775 --> 02:37:26.621]  We have an opportunity here, 5,500 people in this room, to think about what we are as an institution.
[02:37:26.621 --> 02:37:27.302]  You're a predator.
[02:37:27.302 --> 02:37:32.846]  This is our institution and no one can take away our values.
[02:37:32.846 --> 02:37:36.269]  No one can write on a board and question our values.
[02:37:36.269 --> 02:37:37.591]  Look at how they're glaring at the military.
[02:37:37.591 --> 02:37:39.232]  No one can take that away from us.
[02:37:39.232 --> 02:37:40.093]  The contractors are.
[02:37:41.015 --> 02:37:41.695]  Look at this guy.
[02:37:41.695 --> 02:37:48.940]  So just in case you're unclear on where I stand on this topic, I'm going to leave you with my most important thought today.
[02:37:48.940 --> 02:37:51.562]  Just in case you're not clear, I'm the hero.
[02:37:51.562 --> 02:37:57.886]  If you can't teach someone with dignity and respect, then you need to get out.
[02:37:57.886 --> 02:37:58.766]  You need to get out!
[02:37:58.766 --> 02:37:59.407]  You did it!
[02:37:59.407 --> 02:38:00.087]  You did it!
[02:38:00.087 --> 02:38:00.908]  You did it!
[02:38:00.908 --> 02:38:07.432]  If you can't teach someone from another gender, whether that's a man or a woman, with dignity and respect, then you need to get out.
[02:38:07.432 --> 02:38:07.832]  Hit pause.
[02:38:09.230 --> 02:38:10.330]  You need to get out!
[02:38:10.330 --> 02:38:23.713]  If you can't kill your man and your woman with dignity and respect, you need to get out!
[02:38:23.713 --> 02:38:31.415]  God, they are so upset about the Christian ethos of ending slavery, ending segregation.
[02:38:31.415 --> 02:38:33.315]  They hijacked, they took control.
[02:38:33.315 --> 02:38:35.356]  Now they want to try to reintegrate it under political correctness.
[02:38:35.356 --> 02:38:36.096]  It's not working.
[02:38:37.899 --> 02:38:39.861]  Polls show racism is at all-time lows.
[02:38:39.861 --> 02:38:41.203]  People are coming together.
[02:38:41.203 --> 02:38:42.604]  They don't know what to do.
[02:38:42.604 --> 02:38:45.488]  Everybody's syncing up right now in the group collective.
[02:38:45.488 --> 02:38:47.250]  They want us all hating each other.
[02:38:47.250 --> 02:38:53.136]  It's been proven so that we don't sync up in the big ethos, in the big group collective, in the big group consciousness.
[02:38:53.136 --> 02:38:53.517]  It's real.
[02:38:54.602 --> 02:38:56.222]  The big internet.
[02:38:56.222 --> 02:38:57.283]  And they are panicking.
[02:38:57.283 --> 02:38:58.223]  What do we do?
[02:38:58.223 --> 02:38:59.203]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:38:59.203 --> 02:39:00.544]  Get in there.
[02:39:00.544 --> 02:39:01.384]  Keep them desperate.
[02:39:01.384 --> 02:39:02.544]  Make them fight with each other.
[02:39:02.544 --> 02:39:03.304]  They're coming together.
[02:39:03.304 --> 02:39:03.624]  What do we do?
[02:39:03.624 --> 02:39:05.865]  Get them to fight harder!
[02:39:05.865 --> 02:39:08.506]  What do we do?
[02:39:08.506 --> 02:39:11.026]  I want everybody to be prosperous.
[02:39:11.026 --> 02:39:14.827]  You think if I was looking in a neighborhood and I drove by and there was nice cars and nice people.
[02:39:14.827 --> 02:39:16.488]  They were Hispanic or black or whatever.
[02:39:16.488 --> 02:39:18.308]  I don't care what color they were.
[02:39:18.308 --> 02:39:21.769]  If they're nice, I'd live there.
[02:39:21.769 --> 02:39:23.890]  The main thing is don't be creepy with a chip on your shoulder.
[02:39:25.282 --> 02:39:31.367]  And I'll tell you, in my experience, weird upper-class white people are who you don't want to live around.
[02:39:31.367 --> 02:39:34.870]  But that isn't some anti-white statement.
[02:39:34.870 --> 02:39:37.051]  It's a statement of truth.
[02:39:37.051 --> 02:39:39.213]  And they're the types that are running the show.
[02:39:39.213 --> 02:39:51.083]  They are so aware, like psychopaths, of how normal people operate, that they can't help but flip those levers, because you can be a big hero on TV exposing the racism.
[02:39:54.349 --> 02:40:11.875]  The racism of the NFL being 90% black, the average player being paid $5 million a year, and then you take that and turn it into an example of how white people, half the folks in the stands, worshipping black people, wearing their jerseys, they're out to get you?
[02:40:11.875 --> 02:40:14.836]  If you can get folks to buy into that and get people that are worth
[02:40:16.923 --> 02:40:27.011]  Tens of millions of dollars bitching how they're oppressed, while somebody making $50,000 a year is spending 20% of their discretionary income on tickets to come kiss your butt!
[02:40:27.011 --> 02:40:29.072]  Then, baby, you can do anything!
[02:40:29.072 --> 02:40:32.055]  Because if that isn't mind control, I don't know what is.
[02:40:32.055 --> 02:40:34.216]  Oh, do we have the clip?
[02:40:34.216 --> 02:40:36.698]  GOP Senators Question Trump's Competency.
[02:40:36.698 --> 02:40:38.500]  Moral Authority, we told you first that was coming.
[02:40:38.500 --> 02:40:41.242]  You want to play that clip?
[02:40:41.242 --> 02:40:42.002]  Is this the clip with her?
[02:40:42.002 --> 02:40:44.464]  I just saw the text.
[02:40:44.464 --> 02:40:46.005]  Oh, this is the professor's article?
[02:40:46.005 --> 02:40:46.686]  Let's play a clip of it.
[02:40:47.978 --> 02:40:56.483]  Not only is Donald Trump a white supremacist sympathizer, I think he identifies with this notion of white supremacy, this notion of preservation of white culture.
[02:40:56.483 --> 02:40:58.104]  Oh my gosh, mama.
[02:40:58.104 --> 02:41:01.085]  Does that make him a white supremacist?
[02:41:01.085 --> 02:41:02.086]  Yeah.
[02:41:02.086 --> 02:41:03.086]  I can't hear anymore.
[02:41:03.086 --> 02:41:05.848]  Everybody's a white supremacist, I get it.
[02:41:05.848 --> 02:41:10.450]  Everybody's one but George Soros is an actual Nazi, I get it.
[02:41:10.450 --> 02:41:13.832]  The literal people putting swastikas on their cars with
[02:41:15.939 --> 02:41:25.326]  Crosses through it, you know, with red Ghostbuster symbols over it, is funded by a real Nazi.
[02:41:25.326 --> 02:41:28.169]  You can't make that up!
[02:41:28.169 --> 02:41:31.591]  In fact, it would be hilarious if it wasn't so true!
[02:41:31.591 --> 02:41:45.102]  I mean, what Twilight Zone fruitcake land did I wake up in, where in the town I live, they had a big event at a hotel with naked men, with gigantic
[02:41:48.459 --> 02:41:54.800]  Male organs covered in silver glitter.
[02:41:54.800 --> 02:42:01.362]  Standing there with little kids, holding them and kissing them.
[02:42:01.362 --> 02:42:03.242]  That's power.
[02:42:03.242 --> 02:42:04.202]  That's just one of the photos.
[02:42:04.202 --> 02:42:14.405]  They got him kissing a little boy, let's dress up like a girl, with a man with his genitals covered in glitter.
[02:42:14.405 --> 02:42:16.005]  And little kids handing money to him.
[02:42:17.236 --> 02:42:20.919]  And then I'm the bad guy for going, whoa, man, that is creepy!
[02:42:20.919 --> 02:42:30.769]  Can you imagine if you or I showed up at a park with glitter on our... genitals?
[02:42:30.769 --> 02:42:32.090]  And we wandered up to some kids.
[02:42:32.090 --> 02:42:35.993]  They come over and give us money.
[02:42:35.993 --> 02:42:36.854]  And they hug us.
[02:42:36.854 --> 02:42:40.517]  And their moms are there fawning over us.
[02:42:40.517 --> 02:42:41.699]  That's what we've reached, folks.
[02:42:43.270 --> 02:42:49.974]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:43:02.859 --> 02:43:13.687]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:43:13.687 --> 02:43:15.808]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:43:15.808 --> 02:43:19.811]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:43:19.811 --> 02:43:21.012]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but
[02:43:21.252 --> 02:43:29.438]  We've got the best chloride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:43:29.438 --> 02:43:32.079]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[02:43:32.079 --> 02:43:34.881]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:43:34.881 --> 02:43:37.843]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:43:37.843 --> 02:43:46.569]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:43:46.569 --> 02:43:50.992]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:43:57.415 --> 02:44:03.939]  We're running the biggest specials we've run in like six months and free shipping store-wide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:03.939 --> 02:44:08.322]  And when we sell products at this low a price, we've got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation.
[02:44:08.322 --> 02:44:13.666]  But I know the products are so good, that even though we make a very small profit on each item, you'll like them and then order more.
[02:44:13.666 --> 02:44:21.771]  Especially things like the coffee that's so good, or our toothpaste, or our mouthwash, or our vitamin mineral fusion, uh, fruit punch drink.
[02:44:21.771 --> 02:44:24.453]  It's got all the amino acids and multivitamins.
[02:44:24.453 --> 02:44:25.754]  Our probiotic.
[02:44:25.754 --> 02:44:26.214]  All of it.
[02:44:26.214 --> 02:44:27.235]  Super Mill Vitality.
[02:44:28.036 --> 02:44:29.977]  50% off, never done that, and free shipping.
[02:44:29.977 --> 02:44:30.738]  Boom.
[02:44:30.738 --> 02:44:33.500]  Super Filmo Vitality, 50% off, with free shipping.
[02:44:33.500 --> 02:44:34.021]  Boom.
[02:44:34.021 --> 02:44:36.723]  Bomb Defense, 50% off, with free shipping.
[02:44:36.723 --> 02:44:38.925]  With the free shipping, folks, it's a lost leader.
[02:44:38.925 --> 02:44:42.408]  You sign up for auto ship, we're losing like six, seven dollars on this.
[02:44:42.408 --> 02:44:44.450]  Doesn't matter, I just want you to see how great it is.
[02:44:44.450 --> 02:44:50.795]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast, America Rebirth and Renaissance with so much coming up today.
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:56.441]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:44:56.441 --> 02:44:57.762]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:44:57.762 --> 02:44:58.963]  Why is this so good?
[02:44:58.963 --> 02:45:04.246]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:45:04.246 --> 02:45:17.794]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:45:17.794 --> 02:45:19.155]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:45:19.935 --> 02:45:21.576]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:45:21.576 --> 02:45:24.157]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:45:24.157 --> 02:45:25.458]  These are all parasites.
[02:45:25.458 --> 02:45:26.558]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:45:26.558 --> 02:45:27.919]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:45:27.919 --> 02:45:32.401]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bug, the organic wormwood.
[02:45:32.401 --> 02:45:35.543]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:45:35.663 --> 02:45:38.725]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:45:38.725 --> 02:45:39.786]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:45:39.786 --> 02:45:41.727]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:45:41.727 --> 02:45:42.747]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:45:42.747 --> 02:45:45.429]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:45:45.429 --> 02:45:48.711]  And you support the broadcast, InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:45:48.711 --> 02:45:50.953]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:45:50.953 --> 02:45:52.914]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:45:54.597 --> 02:45:58.538]  Enjoy all natural bath and beauty products with Emmerich's Essentials.

[02:46:51.643 --> 02:46:56.906]  That's Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:56.906 --> 02:46:59.507]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.793 --> 02:47:24.536]  A gazillion miles.
[02:47:24.536 --> 02:47:28.538]  A gazillion miles.
[02:47:28.538 --> 02:47:41.005]  So there's hotels here in Austin with men dancing around half naked on stripper poles, little kids giving them money, and men posing with little kids with no clothes on.
[02:47:41.005 --> 02:47:44.567]  But I guess it's okay, they've got glitter on their genitals.
[02:47:48.936 --> 02:47:51.657]  And then I read all the government documents and I realize what it's all about.
[02:47:51.657 --> 02:47:52.538]  The end of the family.
[02:47:52.538 --> 02:47:54.639]  The total fall of civilization.
[02:47:54.639 --> 02:47:56.560]  I want to take some of your phone calls right now.
[02:47:56.560 --> 02:48:09.006]  Kevin and Nelson and Connor and Alyssa and Mike and Ed and Sean and Matt Dubiel is going to be co-hosting with me in the next hour with our great Chicago affiliate.
[02:48:09.006 --> 02:48:16.330]  But it really is crazy to watch them build the EU army in secret and then say it didn't exist five, six years ago when we first covered it.
[02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:22.921]  And to now see them announce this as a secret army of the EU, built in Germany.
[02:48:22.921 --> 02:48:24.841]  Aircraft, tanks, submarines, you name it.
[02:48:24.841 --> 02:48:27.402]  Aircraft carriers, all being announced.
[02:48:27.402 --> 02:48:29.482]  It's like a replay of the 1930s all over again.
[02:48:29.482 --> 02:48:33.363]  It's insane.
[02:48:33.363 --> 02:48:40.924]  Just like the roaring 20s before the Great Depression, we're just here partying and... Well, hey, be open!
[02:48:40.924 --> 02:48:46.125]  Let a little 5-year-old girl go over and give $10 to a big fat man shaking his ass in her face.
[02:48:48.723 --> 02:48:51.268]  Be open!
[02:48:51.268 --> 02:48:52.911]  And by the way, we're going to teach your kids this.
[02:49:01.837 --> 02:49:04.198]  This is my favorite new t-shirt.
[02:49:04.198 --> 02:49:09.100]  I did a commercial for some reason this didn't get the stack I was promoting.
[02:49:09.100 --> 02:49:11.881]  But I should have said it's the shirt I don't want to promote.
[02:49:11.881 --> 02:49:13.662]  But it is the shirt I want to promote.
[02:49:13.662 --> 02:49:16.724]  It is Won't Tread On Me, Big Gadsden Snake.
[02:49:16.724 --> 02:49:18.624]  No flag, just a snake.
[02:49:18.624 --> 02:49:19.785]  Really nice yellow.
[02:49:21.141 --> 02:49:22.702]  Kind of like National Park Yellow.
[02:49:22.702 --> 02:49:24.062]  It's not even like a school bus yellow.
[02:49:24.062 --> 02:49:25.803]  It's like a National Park Yellow.
[02:49:25.803 --> 02:49:27.583]  It says, Won't Tread on Me.
[02:49:27.583 --> 02:49:28.984]  Infowars.com.
[02:49:28.984 --> 02:49:30.944]  On the right-hand shoulder, the American flag.
[02:49:30.944 --> 02:49:31.945]  Infowars.com.
[02:49:31.945 --> 02:49:36.246]  On the back, really soft, great fabric.
[02:49:36.246 --> 02:49:38.147]  And it helps fund our operation.
[02:49:38.147 --> 02:49:39.267]  It is amazing.
[02:49:39.267 --> 02:49:40.267]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:49:40.267 --> 02:49:44.569]  And it's your purchase of the products that makes it all
[02:49:52.574 --> 02:49:53.976]  Possible.
[02:49:53.976 --> 02:49:58.140]  Again, this was printed in the U.S., but actually sewn in Mexico.
[02:49:58.140 --> 02:50:03.667]  Because for this quality of shirt, it'd be even more if it wasn't.
[02:50:03.667 --> 02:50:05.929]  A lot of our shirts are made in America.
[02:50:05.929 --> 02:50:09.133]  But I'm really proud of this shirt.
[02:50:09.133 --> 02:50:10.455]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:50:10.455 --> 02:50:11.756]  Please get it today.
[02:50:12.711 --> 02:50:15.393]  And we've got free shipping still running storewide.
[02:50:15.393 --> 02:50:18.376]  A bunch of the specials that were there, though, did end as I said they would.
[02:50:18.376 --> 02:50:19.997]  Super Mel Vitality's gone.
[02:50:19.997 --> 02:50:22.259]  Paleo Caveman Bone brought this back on.
[02:50:22.259 --> 02:50:24.220]  I know we're about to sell out of it.
[02:50:24.220 --> 02:50:26.522]  We still have the Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:50:26.522 --> 02:50:30.825]  That's still 50% off and a lot of other great new deals that are going to end in two days.
[02:50:30.825 --> 02:50:34.228]  Because a lot of these new things we're doing at 50% off are about to sell out.
[02:50:34.228 --> 02:50:36.350]  So these are really true loss leaders.
[02:50:36.350 --> 02:50:38.632]  It's time for auto shit with an additional 10% off, but whatever you do.
[02:50:39.272 --> 02:50:40.012]  We're not perfect.
[02:50:40.012 --> 02:50:42.173]  God, half the time I can't listen to myself.
[02:50:42.173 --> 02:50:47.234]  But the point is, thanks for putting up with us and just get the products.
[02:50:47.234 --> 02:50:47.935]  Use them.
[02:50:47.935 --> 02:50:49.495]  Know you're funding our operation.
[02:50:49.495 --> 02:50:50.655]  Tell us what you think about them.
[02:50:50.655 --> 02:50:53.256]  They have like 98% success rates.
[02:50:53.256 --> 02:50:55.337]  Okay.
[02:50:55.337 --> 02:51:00.038]  Kevin in Jacksonville, Florida wants to talk about assimilation in Dearborn.
[02:51:00.038 --> 02:51:05.020]  I think he's probably talking about the latest jihadi stabbing at the Mall of America in Minneapolis, St.
[02:51:05.020 --> 02:51:05.100]  Paul.
[02:51:06.946 --> 02:51:20.751]  And the Somali that did it, and the fact that it was footage shot at the mall, 95% Somali's there now because Minnesota, I mean Minneapolis is the new capital of Somalia.
[02:51:20.751 --> 02:51:21.871]  And they're not assimilating.
[02:51:21.871 --> 02:51:25.913]  You can't go to Somalia and live, but we're supposed to bring them here and then they're going to live in peace.
[02:51:27.455 --> 02:51:33.285]  And the left encourages them, don't give up your culture, cut your women's genitals off, shell them, beat them, kill them, this is liberal.
[02:51:33.285 --> 02:51:35.509]  It's always liberal as long as it's anti-christian.
[02:51:35.509 --> 02:51:38.435]  So Kevin, tell us about assimilation in Dearborn, Michigan.
[02:51:40.075 --> 02:51:40.836]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:51:40.836 --> 02:51:56.785]  As you pointed out, I'm actually originally from Redford, but I have two uncles who live in Dearborn, and I want people to be aware that this left pushing this ridiculous theme of bringing everybody in with open arms is ridiculous.
[02:51:56.785 --> 02:51:59.647]  It's not just Dearborn, Michigan.
[02:51:59.647 --> 02:52:02.809]  It's really the whole state of Michigan that is literally
[02:52:03.630 --> 02:52:04.913]  It's like Sharia law.
[02:52:04.913 --> 02:52:08.139]  There's certain places that... They've got the minarets up.
[02:52:08.139 --> 02:52:10.643]  They've got call to prayer.
[02:52:10.643 --> 02:52:13.028]  Businesses that sell alcohol or people are getting beat up.
[02:52:13.028 --> 02:52:13.388]  It's on.
[02:52:15.204 --> 02:52:20.466]  Joel, I can't think of his name, he did a There's No Place Like Utopia video.
[02:52:20.466 --> 02:52:31.269]  He went there and even he was scared for his life and he had armed security, so people need to be aware of who they're letting in and why these corrupt elected officials are doing it.
[02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:33.310]  They're doing it to push an agenda.
[02:52:33.310 --> 02:52:40.372]  And another thing is, Michigan's another great place for being an economy to be wiped out.
[02:52:40.372 --> 02:52:43.053]  People also need to be aware of these AI technologies because
[02:52:43.633 --> 02:53:07.148]  People have to understand that, um, Michigan used to be the hub of the industrial revolution as far as the car business goes, and then when these agendas got pushed to bring in robots to take over these people's jobs, uh, people just need to be aware, they need to understand that, you know, you, when you, when you bring in all these technologies, sometimes you're giving up more than just, uh,
[02:53:07.768 --> 02:53:14.311]  There's a lot of people that are out of jobs now, and this tech boom bubble, it's not going to last forever.
[02:53:14.311 --> 02:53:16.852]  You're going to have to have humans build these things.
[02:53:16.852 --> 02:53:20.654]  If not, you're going to see like we're seeing in Saudi Arabia with robots going to take over.
[02:53:20.654 --> 02:53:23.355]  No, that's it.
[02:53:23.355 --> 02:53:27.817]  What the hell, the left just wants to be able to pose naked with your child in a photo.
[02:53:27.817 --> 02:53:29.858]  So, great point, Kevin.
[02:53:29.858 --> 02:53:31.038]  It's very dangerous.
[02:53:31.038 --> 02:53:35.540]  Did you see the footage during the stabbing in the Mall of America?
[02:53:35.540 --> 02:53:36.321]  Just nothing but
[02:53:37.392 --> 02:53:41.575]  It looks like you're in downtown Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
[02:53:41.575 --> 02:53:42.415]  It's crazy.
[02:53:42.415 --> 02:53:45.397]  There's a mall in Westland.
[02:53:45.397 --> 02:53:46.718]  I think it's Westland, Michigan.
[02:53:46.718 --> 02:53:48.420]  It's called Fairlane Mall.
[02:53:48.420 --> 02:53:54.263]  It's actually one of the most dangerous malls in America because it's totally Islamic.
[02:53:54.263 --> 02:53:58.927]  When I saw the footage, it looked pretty much like it was the Mall of America.
[02:53:58.927 --> 02:54:01.909]  Everyone's in full burqas with hijabs.
[02:54:03.130 --> 02:54:15.819]  Nobody speaks English and especially if you're a white male and you walk around there you get weird looks and I think the crazy thing is that you have the two people were trying to defend their property from being stolen.
[02:54:15.819 --> 02:54:26.848]  I mean what does that say about these tolerant, loving Islamists that they're trying to steal somebody's stuff and the guy was trying to defend himself and he gets stabbed.
[02:54:26.848 --> 02:54:30.391]  Well if you notice, if you watch this video, the errands
[02:54:31.752 --> 02:54:33.194]  They don't want to assimilate.
[02:54:33.194 --> 02:54:34.515]  They're going to assimilate you and that.
[02:54:34.515 --> 02:54:35.757]  Just even the kids are trotting around.
[02:54:35.757 --> 02:54:38.159]  It's like... Just back the video up.
[02:54:38.159 --> 02:54:38.880]  Just trotting around.
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:40.442]  It's like, you bet we're taking over.
[02:54:40.442 --> 02:54:43.565]  Get used to it.
[02:54:43.565 --> 02:54:47.790]  The loving police officials and they give them the key to the city after this is all done.
[02:54:47.790 --> 02:54:50.974]  I mean, it's incredible with the time we're living in, Alex.
[02:54:52.867 --> 02:54:56.968]  We've been asleep, brother, and people that hate us are in control.
[02:54:56.968 --> 02:55:01.949]  And that's why they're so scared of Trump, because he's just not out to get us.
[02:55:01.949 --> 02:55:09.331]  And you read about this, like 90% of the Muslims are on welfare.
[02:55:09.331 --> 02:55:10.711]  They have another job.
[02:55:10.711 --> 02:55:11.651]  It's all fraud.
[02:55:11.651 --> 02:55:12.671]  It's all a joke.
[02:55:12.671 --> 02:55:16.972]  It's all... I mean, they won't let us move to their country is what I'm saying.
[02:55:16.972 --> 02:55:18.693]  Oh, you're being racist.
[02:55:18.693 --> 02:55:20.073]  I can't move to their country.
[02:55:21.571 --> 02:55:34.342]  You should send one of your reporters to a social security office in Texas because I'm pretty sure it's like it is down here in Florida and up in Michigan and it's literally like you're at the United Nations Convention.
[02:55:34.342 --> 02:55:44.530]  It's anybody who's not American, nobody speaks English, I've been in there before and heard Creole, Spanish, Arabic, Farsi, Russian,
[02:55:45.271 --> 02:55:46.832]  Anything and everything but American.
[02:55:46.832 --> 02:55:48.433]  None of the tellers are American.
[02:55:48.433 --> 02:55:50.495]  Everyone has anti-American rhetoric.
[02:55:50.495 --> 02:55:51.515]  It's just incredible.
[02:55:51.515 --> 02:55:52.156]  No, I know.
[02:55:52.156 --> 02:55:53.677]  And we've allowed this to happen.
[02:55:53.677 --> 02:55:55.798]  And here's the deal.
[02:55:55.798 --> 02:55:57.399]  It's not that immigrants are bad.
[02:55:57.399 --> 02:56:02.823]  It's that the globalists are bringing in the worst and forging them into an army.
[02:56:02.823 --> 02:56:03.884]  It's just incredible.
[02:56:03.884 --> 02:56:05.645]  Thank you.
[02:56:05.645 --> 02:56:07.046]  See, I took one caller in that segment.
[02:56:07.046 --> 02:56:08.927]  I've got like ten more, but these are great callers.
[02:56:12.884 --> 02:56:15.085]  Let's go ahead and go to Conor in Long Island, New York.
[02:56:15.085 --> 02:56:16.846]  Conor, you're on the air.
[02:56:16.846 --> 02:56:18.127]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:56:18.127 --> 02:56:21.969]  I just kind of wanted to bring something to your attention, maybe completely meaningless.
[02:56:21.969 --> 02:56:25.250]  I sent it to Shepard Ambelis this week before he went on your show.
[02:56:25.250 --> 02:56:37.796]  There's an article from the Las Vegas Review Journal for August 2017 talking about a quote, Middle Eastern Air Force booking the entire W Las Vegas.
[02:56:37.796 --> 02:56:40.858]  Long story short, you scroll down to the end of the article,
[02:56:41.604 --> 02:56:51.215]  And it specifies that this is suggested to be a Saudi Air Force, and they will be staying this year at BW instead of the Four Seasons.
[02:56:51.215 --> 02:56:54.778]  That's where they traditionally stay for this exercise every year with the U.S.
[02:56:54.778 --> 02:56:55.119]  Air Force.
[02:56:56.397 --> 02:56:58.939]  The Four Seasons is the top floor of the Mandalay Bay.
[02:56:58.939 --> 02:56:59.119]  Yes.
[02:56:59.119 --> 02:57:01.340]  I just found that to be a little interesting.
[02:57:01.340 --> 02:57:08.185]  Maybe your team can kind of... Uh, our military is sourced to say it was basically an attempt to kill the prince and it was all a big Civil War deal.
[02:57:08.185 --> 02:57:12.048]  And then, uh, guests we've had on the talk about that have been picked up by the FBI.
[02:57:12.048 --> 02:57:13.289]  So yeah, it's very, very serious.
[02:57:14.181 --> 02:57:17.124]  I just found that very interesting.
[02:57:17.124 --> 02:57:17.644]  Stay there!
[02:57:17.644 --> 02:57:18.465]  Don't hang up, Connor.
[02:57:18.465 --> 02:57:19.426]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:57:19.426 --> 02:57:23.149]  And I'm going to go to all the calls before Matt D'Aviello takes over.
[02:57:23.149 --> 02:57:27.974]  Straight ahead, 70 seconds away, 4th hour, then the war room with Owen Short.
[02:57:27.974 --> 02:57:30.476]  Yeah, it's just, it's absolutely crazy.
[02:57:30.476 --> 02:57:35.200]  I don't know what's worse, the radical Islam or the pedophile networks.
[02:57:35.200 --> 02:57:36.542]  I think the pedophiles.
[02:57:36.542 --> 02:57:37.603]  I think they're the worst thing.
[02:57:44.540 --> 02:57:49.267]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[02:59:36.003 --> 02:59:36.323]  Win, win,
[02:59:36.323 --> 02:59:38.265]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:04.670 --> 03:00:07.071]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[03:00:07.071 --> 03:00:22.259]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:22.259 --> 03:00:28.822]  All right, Conor in Long Island, you were getting into the Saudi Air Force occupying the very floors where the attacks were launched from.
[03:00:28.822 --> 03:00:31.003]  Yeah, that's what the feds don't want us to get into.
[03:00:31.003 --> 03:00:32.724]  It's the whole Saudi civil war.
[03:00:32.724 --> 03:00:34.005]  Trump reportedly has struck back.
[03:00:35.216 --> 03:00:45.159]  With all these arrests of the pro-Islamist globalist forces, I'm going to still sit back and watch and see exactly what fleshes out, but I think you're over the target with those statements.
[03:00:45.159 --> 03:00:48.840]  Go ahead.
[03:00:48.840 --> 03:00:50.341]  It's kind of right out in the open.
[03:00:50.341 --> 03:01:00.244]  Las Vegas Review-Journal, August 4th, 2017, discussing that the Saudi delegations typically stay at Mandalay Bay.
[03:01:00.244 --> 03:01:03.125]  Essentially the tough floors are the four seasons.
[03:01:04.080 --> 03:01:08.803]  Which a Saudi Prince owns almost 50% of, but this year they did not stay there.
[03:01:08.803 --> 03:01:17.807]  Could be totally nothing, but you know, obviously people like yourself and Shepard that are more in the know would be able to kind of dig into that, but just found that to be a little interesting.
[03:01:17.807 --> 03:01:19.248]  So, thanks for taking my call.
[03:01:19.248 --> 03:01:21.870]  Well, just to be clear, you're in the know as much as we are.
[03:01:21.870 --> 03:01:25.872]  You're a smart, sentient being, but yeah, that's where this whole investigation is going.
[03:01:25.872 --> 03:01:28.033]  Saudi Arabia, civil war situation.
[03:01:29.872 --> 03:01:34.923]  Let's talk to, thank you sir, let's talk to Sean in California on the air.
[03:01:34.923 --> 03:01:36.366]  Hi Alex, pleasure to speak with you again.
[03:01:38.228 --> 03:02:05.374]  I just want to say, man, I gotta tell you, I got your products late in my game, but I have ADHD and I gotta tell you, your brain force definitely makes my neuros connect a lot cleaner and I don't think that it's promoted that way, but if you have people that are, you know, in my age, 30 year old, who need something to focus, definitely one of the greatest things I've ever had and I've taken Dexedrine, Ritalin, this is like the smoothest, like, concentrator I've ever been on.
[03:02:06.616 --> 03:02:07.584]  Well, let me be clear.
[03:02:07.584 --> 03:02:08.673]  Everybody's brain's different.
[03:02:09.776 --> 03:02:13.760]  And just like studies show, Ritalin helps some people, hurts others.
[03:02:13.760 --> 03:02:16.122]  This doesn't have drugs and it has legal compounds.
[03:02:16.122 --> 03:02:26.511]  Some, though, are drugs in Europe, but only with what was very safe and known to help people to have, like you said, smooth brain function.
[03:02:26.511 --> 03:02:35.599]  Not jacked up, not low, but let your brain have the compounds and chemicals it needs for normal electrochemical operation.
[03:02:37.020 --> 03:02:40.462]  At the normal price of $39, it's a pretty good deal.
[03:02:40.462 --> 03:02:44.524]  But we always sell it for a discount, you know, at least 20%.
[03:02:44.524 --> 03:02:50.347]  So it really is the Rolls Royce of nootropics at a much lower price.
[03:02:50.347 --> 03:02:55.950]  There are a lot of other brands that have similar compounds in them and similar mixes for $80 or $200.
[03:02:55.950 --> 03:02:59.772]  People tend to respect that more and think, well, it must be really good if it costs a lot.
[03:02:59.772 --> 03:03:02.294]  No, it's just marked up four times, five times.
[03:03:02.294 --> 03:03:04.775]  We mark Brain Force up at regular sales price 100%.
[03:03:06.596 --> 03:03:11.560]  When we sell it at $29, it's only marked up, you know, like 50%, 60%.
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:13.762]  So, again, thank you for your support.
[03:03:13.762 --> 03:03:15.903]  I'm glad you like Brain Force.
[03:03:15.903 --> 03:03:17.485]  It is powerful.
[03:03:17.485 --> 03:03:19.546]  I mean, overall, you're talking about it.
[03:03:19.546 --> 03:03:22.869]  I mean, describe what it's like when you're on it.
[03:03:22.869 --> 03:03:27.752]  Man, the one thing I can tell you, it makes you feel like what you're supposed to feel.
[03:03:27.752 --> 03:03:30.875]  Like, you know, you get coffee or something like that.
[03:03:31.685 --> 03:03:53.160]  Uh, it's something that definitely wakes up your brain, makes your brain waves a lot smoother, connect way quicker so that if you're in like a confrontation and you usually have a issue with coming out clean, this gives you the opportunity to get all your thoughts out clean, the way you want it to come out, and it just gives you like the actual power that you know what you're talking about.
[03:03:53.160 --> 03:03:53.921]  I was about to say,
[03:03:56.028 --> 03:04:07.511]  I used to do late night radio a lot, coast to coast AM, you name it, and at like 10 at night, coffee doesn't work anymore, so I found beer in low levels as a stimulant, but then that would make me, you know, out of shape.
[03:04:07.511 --> 03:04:10.972]  And then I tried other nootropism things that would speed me up too much.
[03:04:10.972 --> 03:04:14.773]  The thing is, I can take Brain Force and go to sleep in two hours if I need to.
[03:04:14.773 --> 03:04:18.834]  What it does is it just gives you the connectivity you need.
[03:04:18.834 --> 03:04:22.995]  It doesn't speed you up, it just gives you the baseline building blocks
[03:04:23.996 --> 03:04:31.421]  To then be supercharged, and I'm really proud of it, so I want to thank you for your support, Sean, and I want to thank you for promoting BrainForce.
[03:04:31.421 --> 03:04:33.262]  Thank you, sir.
[03:04:33.262 --> 03:04:36.144]  Anything else you want to add?
[03:04:36.144 --> 03:04:40.007]  I just want to say, if anybody wants a free sticker, I drive a bright red truck.
[03:04:40.007 --> 03:04:41.768]  Come and get your We The People sticker.
[03:04:41.768 --> 03:04:43.709]  I'll give them out in traffic.
[03:04:43.709 --> 03:04:44.570]  That's awesome, brother.
[03:04:44.570 --> 03:04:50.194]  We'll be back to interview Matt Dubial from our Chicago affiliate, and take some of your calls straight ahead.
[03:04:53.052 --> 03:04:57.438]  You go to InfoWarsTore.com and get game-changing, amazing products.
[03:04:57.438 --> 03:05:01.223]  We've been sold out of DNA Force for almost four months.
[03:05:01.223 --> 03:05:06.771]  These ingredients are nutraceutical grade, you know, the highest quality, the bio-PQQ, all of it.
[03:05:06.771 --> 03:05:07.011]  It's 25% off.
[03:05:08.232 --> 03:05:09.073]  We're good to go.
[03:05:25.069 --> 03:05:29.230]  Out of the gates, back in stock, but for a very limited time.
[03:05:29.230 --> 03:05:31.711]  So you get the highest quality, the very cleanest stuff out there.
[03:05:31.711 --> 03:05:33.171]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:05:33.171 --> 03:05:35.051]  DNA Force and Biome Defense.
[03:05:35.051 --> 03:05:35.592]  Probiotic.
[03:05:35.592 --> 03:05:36.452]  Now back in stock.
[03:05:36.452 --> 03:05:37.592]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:05:37.592 --> 03:05:41.433]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[03:05:41.433 --> 03:05:42.573]  It is an act of war.
[03:05:42.573 --> 03:05:44.614]  It is an act of standing up.
[03:05:44.614 --> 03:05:50.175]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[03:06:09.429 --> 03:06:12.071]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:12.071 --> 03:06:19.397]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:06:19.397 --> 03:06:23.881]  WCKG, 1530 AM, Chicago.
[03:06:23.881 --> 03:06:27.303]  Carrying the War Room, it's coming up in an hour.
[03:06:27.303 --> 03:06:29.125]  Carrying Real News at David Knight.
[03:06:29.125 --> 03:06:29.865]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:29.865 --> 03:06:31.587]  He's taking over here right now.
[03:06:31.587 --> 03:06:32.688]  We're taking a few calls.
[03:06:34.198 --> 03:06:45.271]  Before we go to Matt Dubio, but we were just talking to one of the callers about Awakening and about how manipulative all of this is.
[03:06:45.271 --> 03:06:46.672]  It's just crazy.
[03:06:46.672 --> 03:06:48.915]  It's not left-wing right-wing.
[03:06:48.915 --> 03:06:51.438]  I'm the guy that coined the term left-right paradigm.
[03:06:52.469 --> 03:06:54.190]  That they try to put us in the left or right.
[03:06:54.190 --> 03:06:56.972]  It doesn't mean there isn't a left or right debate going on.
[03:06:56.972 --> 03:07:03.496]  It doesn't mean there aren't some issues the left promotes that I think are correct or some issues the right promotes that are correct.
[03:07:03.496 --> 03:07:07.959]  It doesn't mean there isn't elites in control of each group and that it doesn't have big problems.
[03:07:07.959 --> 03:07:11.162]  But that's one spectrum of analysis.
[03:07:11.162 --> 03:07:15.084]  Above that are the technocrats.
[03:07:15.084 --> 03:07:20.348]  And I'm trying to get people to think how the technocrats think and be aware of the larger picture.
[03:07:21.240 --> 03:07:24.902]  That's my real job, because if we do that, we're going to end up winning.
[03:07:24.902 --> 03:07:33.808]  I want to go to Mike and others here in a moment, but going back to Matt Dubiel, who's going to host the shower.
[03:07:33.808 --> 03:07:42.573]  Matt, I've got a lot of news to get to, but I've run out of time, and I've got a few callers here, and I'm kind of coming into your hour, but you've always got big fish to fry.
[03:07:42.573 --> 03:07:44.154]  What's on your radar screen coming up?
[03:07:45.857 --> 03:07:50.859]  I just want to kind of take off on what you just got into.
[03:07:50.859 --> 03:07:53.421]  We do get caught up in this left-right paradigm.
[03:07:53.421 --> 03:08:03.405]  It's easy to do when we're talking about issues like guns or issues like gay rights or tranny rights or whatever the new issue of the day is.
[03:08:03.405 --> 03:08:06.507]  We get divided into this left-right thing and I just think you hit it
[03:08:06.947 --> 03:08:08.208]  Right on the head.
[03:08:08.208 --> 03:08:10.168]  It's not about that paradigm.
[03:08:10.168 --> 03:08:25.574]  It's really about stepping one, you know, getting a layer above that and taking a look at what exactly is going on in this world of ours, this simulation of sorts that we're living in here on this planet for right now, by the way, which I know sounds crazy.
[03:08:25.574 --> 03:08:26.474]  No, it's not.
[03:08:26.474 --> 03:08:27.075]  That's it.
[03:08:27.075 --> 03:08:32.517]  It's about what is the grand manipulation, not following the stuff they say I should follow.
[03:08:32.517 --> 03:08:34.577]  What's really behind all this?
[03:08:34.577 --> 03:08:35.698]  What's the next dimension?
[03:08:37.020 --> 03:08:46.564]  Yeah, and sometimes the people that are perpetrating the ideas are not necessarily complicit in the grand scheme.
[03:08:46.564 --> 03:08:54.868]  They just got lucky and their dopey movie took off and it happens to have undertones of men dressing like women or whatever the thing of the day is.
[03:08:54.868 --> 03:08:55.608]  Exactly.
[03:08:55.608 --> 03:08:58.129]  So many useful idiots are not the enemy.
[03:08:58.129 --> 03:08:59.109]  They don't mean bad.
[03:08:59.109 --> 03:09:00.090]  They're just cannon fodder.
[03:09:01.184 --> 03:09:05.687]  Exactly, and then you look back, and that's one of the things that I'm going to do.
[03:09:05.687 --> 03:09:29.123]  I mean, I was watching your conversations with Gavin today and listening to your show and seeing this thing, this nonsense that's going on in the hotel with the transvestites and the poles and the glitter and the whole thing, and it got me to really think about something that I've been working on for a while, which is mapping out the timeline of mainstream media and how they have systematically, over decades,
[03:09:29.503 --> 03:09:36.688]  Maybe unbeknownst to them, and unbeknownst to most people, perpetrated this idea of men as women.
[03:09:36.688 --> 03:09:41.132]  And it's been happening a little bit like the frog in the boiling pot of water over time.
[03:09:41.132 --> 03:09:47.156]  And I'm going to go back to what I see as the beginning, but I have a feeling when I do it, other people are going to, light bulbs are going to go off.
[03:09:48.604 --> 03:09:50.547]  I'm not against a guy that wants to be a woman.
[03:09:50.547 --> 03:09:51.689]  I mean, I'm a live and let live.
[03:09:51.689 --> 03:09:59.461]  The point is, it's an agenda force-fed everywhere that guys are dumb slobs, or guys should be like women, or women should be in charge.
[03:09:59.461 --> 03:10:00.643]  I'm not against women either.
[03:10:00.643 --> 03:10:03.167]  But they're force-feeding it, and you're going to get into what's behind it.
[03:10:04.178 --> 03:10:05.679]  Yeah, and I agree with you.
[03:10:05.679 --> 03:10:08.722]  As an individual, anybody can do what they want to do.
[03:10:08.722 --> 03:10:14.586]  I believe that we should love and appreciate everybody and respect and appreciate everybody.
[03:10:14.586 --> 03:10:16.448]  But that is not what's happening here.
[03:10:16.448 --> 03:10:17.328]  Exactly.
[03:10:17.328 --> 03:10:20.991]  They're trying to make us accept whatever the new thing is they're pushing.
[03:10:21.992 --> 03:10:23.152]  As normal.
[03:10:23.152 --> 03:10:24.613]  As the way that it is.
[03:10:24.613 --> 03:10:26.053]  And it's not the way it is.
[03:10:26.053 --> 03:10:28.894]  And somebody's got to raise their hand and say, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:10:28.894 --> 03:10:30.115]  You can do what you want to do.
[03:10:30.115 --> 03:10:32.135]  That's pretty goofy.
[03:10:32.135 --> 03:10:33.076]  I'm not going to treat you like this.
[03:10:33.076 --> 03:10:35.757]  But you're not going to teach my kid how to do it.
[03:10:35.757 --> 03:10:36.417]  Amen.
[03:10:36.417 --> 03:10:38.438]  Exactly.
[03:10:38.438 --> 03:10:41.539]  Man, I mean, the globalists are so obsessed with children.
[03:10:41.539 --> 03:10:42.359]  It really is sick.
[03:10:44.227 --> 03:10:47.929]  It's a problem if we allow it to be a problem.
[03:10:47.929 --> 03:10:54.733]  And, you know, there's some things that we do that are very innocent that unfortunately teaches them the wrong things.
[03:10:54.733 --> 03:10:58.155]  I mean, I've been taking my kids trick-or-treating since they were babies.
[03:10:58.155 --> 03:11:00.597]  But think about the concept of the trick-or-treating, right?
[03:11:00.597 --> 03:11:07.001]  We're knocking on strangers' doors and we're talking to people that we've never met, dressing up in... I mean, the whole concept
[03:11:07.681 --> 03:11:09.002]  It's not a good precedent.
[03:11:09.002 --> 03:11:15.568]  It's all ultra-occult to get you outside your family in a weird deal and that's what's going on.
[03:11:15.568 --> 03:11:17.650]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:11:17.650 --> 03:11:22.314]  It's bad training and we have to be as fathers and leaders.
[03:11:22.314 --> 03:11:22.794]  Thank God!
[03:11:22.794 --> 03:11:35.465]  I was thinking about this earlier also when I was watching one of the promos for you and your dad working on some of the supplements at InfoWarsStore.com and I thought, you know, some of us were blessed with great fathers.
[03:11:35.965 --> 03:11:39.368]  And some of us are a blessing to our children as great fathers.
[03:11:39.368 --> 03:11:40.789]  Not everybody has that.
[03:11:40.789 --> 03:11:51.397]  But what they've been doing for years now is systematically dismantling that institution of fatherhood and the idea of being a strong man in your family.
[03:11:51.397 --> 03:11:52.197]  And that's the best thing.
[03:11:52.197 --> 03:12:00.724]  Well, notice, all of Hollywood, all the culture, that their number one enemy, the Super Bowl ads, every major Netflix show, the dad is a piece of crap.
[03:12:02.006 --> 03:12:06.009]  And like, should everyone notice, why does the power structure want to do it?
[03:12:06.009 --> 03:12:09.571]  Because they want a bunch of leaderless people they can run over.
[03:12:09.571 --> 03:12:12.232]  They want to enslave women and children and men.
[03:12:12.232 --> 03:12:14.453]  They want to cut the head off.
[03:12:14.453 --> 03:12:15.494]  And are men slobs?
[03:12:15.494 --> 03:12:17.155]  Have men not turned into pieces of crap?
[03:12:17.155 --> 03:12:18.176]  Absolutely.
[03:12:18.176 --> 03:12:21.438]  The point is, is that it's been done by design.
[03:12:21.438 --> 03:12:27.561]  It has, and there's plenty of good fathers that are doing great jobs, paying lots of attention to their kids.
[03:12:27.561 --> 03:12:28.782]  But they never get any attention.
[03:12:29.548 --> 03:12:30.028]  Never.
[03:12:30.028 --> 03:12:30.769]  You never see him.
[03:12:30.769 --> 03:12:39.992]  Because the ones that you see in the Disney movies, either the Disney movie, there are no parents, and the kids are orphaned, or the father's an idiot.
[03:12:39.992 --> 03:12:44.754]  And that's the state literally coming in to be the mommy and daddy.
[03:12:44.754 --> 03:12:45.895]  Well, they know better than we do.
[03:12:46.460 --> 03:12:47.981]  That's what they want everybody to believe.
[03:12:47.981 --> 03:12:49.141]  They know better.
[03:12:49.141 --> 03:12:50.902]  The kids aren't our kids.
[03:12:50.902 --> 03:12:59.867]  It's clearly an idea that's been implanted in the brains of the masses, which is your leader in your family isn't your father.
[03:12:59.867 --> 03:13:00.927]  Men aren't good.
[03:13:00.927 --> 03:13:01.928]  Men are bad.
[03:13:01.928 --> 03:13:02.688]  Men aren't men.
[03:13:04.747 --> 03:13:06.088]  The state knows better.
[03:13:06.088 --> 03:13:07.109]  The government knows better.
[03:13:07.109 --> 03:13:20.002]  The truth is dad genetically is going to kill himself for you and fight to the death for you and he's the one person they know if he's a straight-up dad focused and his head screwed on straight that's dangerous.
[03:13:20.723 --> 03:13:21.924]  That's why they fear dads.
[03:13:21.924 --> 03:13:33.595]  Because they're genetically ready to do whatever it takes, work themselves to death in coal mines, or in cornfields, or in wars, or to do whatever it takes, or to go after controllers that want to enslave.
[03:13:33.595 --> 03:13:35.296]  What does a conquering army always do?
[03:13:35.296 --> 03:13:36.758]  It kills the men.
[03:13:36.758 --> 03:13:38.659]  And then it takes the children and the women.
[03:13:38.659 --> 03:13:39.700]  And Matt, that's what this is.
[03:13:39.700 --> 03:13:41.182]  We're under a conquering program.
[03:13:42.762 --> 03:13:51.549]  It's, it's, when you really step back and you look at all the things that are going on in the world, what's systematically being done is strong men are being taken out.
[03:13:51.549 --> 03:13:57.113]  And I can, I can almost hear the roar of the feminists going, no, no, it's not what's happening.
[03:13:57.113 --> 03:13:58.734]  Yes, look, take a look.
[03:13:58.734 --> 03:14:03.278]  And then they back Islam that truly enslaves women because that's their final endgame.
[03:14:03.278 --> 03:14:05.259]  They don't want men that empower women.
[03:14:05.259 --> 03:14:07.121]  They want men that enslave women.
[03:14:07.121 --> 03:14:08.101]  It's scientific.
[03:14:08.101 --> 03:14:08.702]  It's pure evil.
[03:14:10.012 --> 03:14:17.400]  It's something that needs to be stopped, and the best line of defense for that is strong fathers and strong mothers together.
[03:14:17.400 --> 03:14:18.481]  Exactly.
[03:14:18.481 --> 03:14:19.883]  Which is unstoppable.
[03:14:19.883 --> 03:14:21.244]  That's the trifecta.
[03:14:21.244 --> 03:14:24.528]  Strong fathers, strong mothers, and children together.
[03:14:24.528 --> 03:14:25.249]  Unstoppable.
[03:14:26.900 --> 03:14:35.567]  It's also that the men, the strong men, need to empower the strong women to be strong in their role as mothers and wives.
[03:14:35.567 --> 03:14:40.931]  And for some reason... And that's what I've got, is my family training martial arts, learning to use firearms, business.
[03:14:40.931 --> 03:14:46.915]  It's not like as a dad who's a libertarian or something, I'm like trying to keep my daughters... No, I'm not an islamicist, I'm the opposite.
[03:14:46.915 --> 03:14:49.157]  I'm not Linda Sorcerer.
[03:14:49.157 --> 03:14:50.358]  Exactly.
[03:14:50.358 --> 03:14:53.721]  If I have a daughter who ends up being the best, I'll put her in charge of everything.
[03:14:54.451 --> 03:14:55.595]  That fast!
[03:14:55.595 --> 03:14:56.136]  That fast!
[03:14:56.136 --> 03:14:57.461]  Boom!
[03:14:57.461 --> 03:14:58.865]  You know who's a great example of that?
[03:14:58.865 --> 03:15:00.851]  Our president and his daughter.
[03:15:02.822 --> 03:15:04.103]  I mean, just look at that.
[03:15:04.103 --> 03:15:05.184]  What an example.
[03:15:05.184 --> 03:15:16.675]  I'll tell you, Alex, I was moved almost to tears at the inauguration when I saw the president kissing his sons, and hugging his sons, and the idea that it's not just his sons.
[03:15:16.675 --> 03:15:18.176]  They're not the heir's apparent.
[03:15:18.176 --> 03:15:19.858]  Ivanka might be the heir apparent.
[03:15:19.858 --> 03:15:21.980]  She might be the one that he hands the keys over to.
[03:15:21.980 --> 03:15:26.424]  I can tell you, she's the one they're looking to be president in about 20 years.
[03:15:26.424 --> 03:15:27.044]  She's got a shot.
[03:15:27.995 --> 03:15:29.155]  Absolutely.
[03:15:29.155 --> 03:15:33.357]  It's amazing, ladies and gentlemen, but a woman's success doesn't penalize men.
[03:15:33.357 --> 03:15:35.318]  A man's success doesn't penalize women.

[03:16:41.225 --> 03:16:42.665]  Or warm and served.

[03:18:03.303 --> 03:18:07.686]  And when we sell products at this low a price, we've got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation.
[03:18:07.686 --> 03:18:13.029]  But I know the products are so good, even though we make a very small profit on each item, you'll like them and then order more.
[03:18:13.029 --> 03:18:21.095]  Especially things like the coffee that's so good, or our toothpaste, or our mouthwash, or our vitamin mineral fusion, uh, fruit punch drink.

[03:18:41.766 --> 03:18:43.807]  Doesn't matter, I just want you to see how great it is.
[03:18:43.807 --> 03:18:50.131]  We are now four and a half hours into the worldwide broadcast, America Rebirth and Renaissance with so much coming up today.
[03:18:52.699 --> 03:18:57.343]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[03:19:32.339 --> 03:19:34.481]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:23.274 --> 03:20:28.900]  I appreciate the Foo Fighters as the walk-up song, as the intro, the rejoin music.
[03:20:28.900 --> 03:20:32.763]  It's Matt Dubiel in for Alex Jones for the fourth hour.
[03:20:32.763 --> 03:20:36.307]  I am broadcasting from the WCKG studios.
[03:20:36.307 --> 03:20:39.230]  Hear it literally on the front lines.
[03:20:39.930 --> 03:20:54.435]  Now, while I'm 20 minutes removed from the carnage that is Chicago, we are broadcasting from the AM 1530 WCKG studios, where we carry... Gosh, I'm so happy that InfoWars has put out some other shows.
[03:20:54.435 --> 03:21:01.537]  Alex is great, but when you're a station manager and you run a radio station, you're looking for more stuff to go with it.
[03:21:01.537 --> 03:21:04.658]  So then you look at the other shows that are out there, and from 8 to 11,
[03:21:06.221 --> 03:21:08.722]  Yeah, like the pickings are pretty slim.
[03:21:08.722 --> 03:21:17.908]  So you got like a Glenn Beck and we tried that and it was just like, man, I don't know where this guy's going with the soccer balls and Ted Cruz and what the heck he's doing.
[03:21:17.908 --> 03:21:21.630]  He wants to be, you know, Deepak Chopra and Oprah, all the Us.
[03:21:22.410 --> 03:21:33.559]  And so we bounced Glenn and now we have David Knight on from 8 to 11 in the morning on FM 102.3 here and AM 1530 and then the War Room we have on from 4 to 6.
[03:21:33.559 --> 03:21:37.302]  So it is a wall-to-wall lineup of InfoWars shows.
[03:21:38.062 --> 03:21:39.764]  And we need it here in Chicago.
[03:21:39.764 --> 03:21:44.207]  Why is Chicago important to you, even though you may not be in Chicago?
[03:21:44.207 --> 03:21:49.011]  Because Chicago is sort of the litmus test for the rest of the country.
[03:21:49.011 --> 03:21:54.756]  If it happened in Detroit, and then if it happens in Chicago, it's coming to a theater near you.
[03:21:54.756 --> 03:21:56.758]  And so these are the things you need to watch out for.
[03:21:56.758 --> 03:22:00.201]  I want to talk briefly, I want to map out
[03:22:01.386 --> 03:22:16.899]  The history of men dressing as women in the mainstream media, because I think that it's important to dissect why this is now something that we all somehow accept as maybe just the way it is today.
[03:22:16.899 --> 03:22:18.540]  And so we're going to talk about that.
[03:22:18.540 --> 03:22:21.343]  But before we do, I do want to mention Michael Evans.
[03:22:22.023 --> 03:22:25.266]  Michael Evans, you may not have heard of Michael Evans.
[03:22:25.266 --> 03:22:31.232]  You probably will never hear about Michael Evans except for right now and right here on InfoWars.
[03:22:31.232 --> 03:22:36.217]  And the reason why is the Chicago death toll hit 562 people over the weekend.
[03:22:36.217 --> 03:22:38.479]  562 people had been shot and killed in Chicago in 2017.
[03:22:45.274 --> 03:22:55.439]  And there have been two new reported deaths and one gunman, one man was gunned down last week and he's been identified as 30-year-old Michael Evans.
[03:22:55.439 --> 03:23:03.563]  You're never going to hear, look at him, he's on the screen if you're watching at Infowars.com forward slash show, Infowars.com slash show.
[03:23:03.563 --> 03:23:07.465]  He's a black man and he wasn't shot by a cop.
[03:23:07.465 --> 03:23:09.926]  So you're probably never going to get hear, you're never going to hear about him.
[03:23:11.235 --> 03:23:19.321]  I will tell you, 14 people have now been shot and killed in the month of November in Chicago.
[03:23:19.321 --> 03:23:25.526]  It's Las Vegas, in slow motion, every month, in Chicago.
[03:23:25.526 --> 03:23:32.311]  Las Vegas, every month, in slow motion.
[03:23:32.311 --> 03:23:40.337]  So it's not as sexy for the cameras, it's not as sexy for Crybaby Kimmel, it's not as sexy for the media, it's not as sexy for the New York Times, it's not as sexy for CNN.
[03:23:41.739 --> 03:23:43.440]  There's not a lot of meat there.
[03:23:43.440 --> 03:23:45.222]  So they're not going to talk about Michael Evans.
[03:23:45.222 --> 03:23:46.723]  God bless Michael Evans.
[03:23:46.723 --> 03:23:50.166]  The governor, who, by the way, so consider this.
[03:23:50.166 --> 03:24:07.539]  When you hear Alex Jones talking about the political system and the left-right paradigm, and how this information is above the left-right paradigm stuff, realize that the mayor of Chicago is a Democrat.
[03:24:07.539 --> 03:24:09.320]  The governor is a Republican.
[03:24:10.743 --> 03:24:15.287]  And there's more murders in Chicago than ever before.
[03:24:15.287 --> 03:24:23.594]  Over 3,700 people have been just shot, not killed, but just shot in a calendar year in Chicago.
[03:24:23.594 --> 03:24:27.377]  If we take a look, and why is that important to you?
[03:24:27.377 --> 03:24:29.038]  If you're in Florida, why is that important to you?
[03:24:29.038 --> 03:24:36.605]  If you're in Texas, if you're in Nevada, if you're in Arkansas, if you're in New York, if you're outside America, this is coming to a theater near you.
[03:24:37.913 --> 03:24:40.356]  It's coming to your local town.
[03:24:40.356 --> 03:24:42.979]  It's being engineered all around you.
[03:24:42.979 --> 03:24:53.412]  It is a result of the world that we live in, the BS laws that are in place, the protections for the criminals, and the provisions against the good guys.
[03:24:54.935 --> 03:25:12.391]  It's indicative of the paralyzed police officers who they really can't do their jobs like they could have because they'll get sued or BLM will protest them or the referent Jesse Jackson jibbity-jibbity jibbity-jibbity and rat-a-tat-tat Jesse Jackson will come on that doorstep
[03:25:14.073 --> 03:25:17.017]  Or Al, uh, I wanted to call him Al Roker.
[03:25:17.017 --> 03:25:18.559]  And then I almost wanted to call him Al Franken.
[03:25:18.559 --> 03:25:19.500]  Who's the other Al?
[03:25:19.500 --> 03:25:20.882]  What's the other guy's name?
[03:25:20.882 --> 03:25:22.704]  He does what Jesse Jackson does.
[03:25:22.704 --> 03:25:23.966]  He's the agitator.
[03:25:23.966 --> 03:25:25.908]  Al Sharpton, thank you.
[03:25:25.908 --> 03:25:26.629]  Not Al Franken.
[03:25:26.629 --> 03:25:28.652]  I mean, they're all in the same boat.
[03:25:28.652 --> 03:25:31.635]  I mean, Al Franken, you know, Roker.
[03:25:32.856 --> 03:25:35.338]  What was the Al Sharpton?
[03:25:35.338 --> 03:25:36.699]  And he's a reverend, right?
[03:25:36.699 --> 03:25:39.762]  I love it how they're just honorary reverends.
[03:25:39.762 --> 03:25:41.423]  Like they got it on the internet or something.
[03:25:41.423 --> 03:25:46.528]  I know guys, and you don't have to be black to do this, you can be black, white, Hispanic, brown, yellow, whatever.
[03:25:46.528 --> 03:25:57.837]  You go on the internet and you could get your degree, so you could call yourself a doctor, and you could go and get your certificate so that you could say that you're a minister or a reverend or whatever it is, and then you can marry people.
[03:25:57.837 --> 03:25:59.979]  But the Reverend Al Sharpton,
[03:26:01.093 --> 03:26:04.057]  Resist we much!
[03:26:04.057 --> 03:26:05.098]  He's nowhere to be seen.
[03:26:05.098 --> 03:26:07.300]  He's nowhere to be found.
[03:26:07.300 --> 03:26:13.788]  Him and Jesse Jackson Jr., jibbity jibbity, jibbity jibbity, they're nowhere to be found.
[03:26:14.577 --> 03:26:19.722]  There's 14 people shot and killed in Chicago, almost all of them black.
[03:26:19.722 --> 03:26:21.423]  And those guys are nowhere to be found.
[03:26:21.423 --> 03:26:23.905]  You know where they're at?
[03:26:23.905 --> 03:26:25.467]  They're on the Wi-Fi right now.
[03:26:25.467 --> 03:26:29.991]  And they're watching their Xfinity, or they're talking to Alexa.
[03:26:29.991 --> 03:26:34.235]  They're doing their high-profile rich guy thing, because they make a lot of money off of
[03:26:35.032 --> 03:26:46.621]  The carnage that is the plight of not just the black man in Illinois and in Chicago and in America, but it's an income thing around the country.
[03:26:46.621 --> 03:27:00.671]  Governor Bruce Rauner, who is a Republican, Rauner, and his wife Diana are trying to make sure members of the military around the world receive holiday cards from people throughout Illinois.
[03:27:00.671 --> 03:27:03.273]  By the way, that's part of the news today.
[03:27:03.273 --> 03:27:04.214]  So, uh,
[03:27:05.003 --> 03:27:11.046]  Poor Michael Evans, 30, shot and killed in Chicago.
[03:27:11.046 --> 03:27:13.827]  And what is Governor Rauner working on?
[03:27:13.827 --> 03:27:24.172]  Him and his wife are working on making sure that the military around the world receives holiday cards from people throughout Illinois.
[03:27:24.172 --> 03:27:27.754]  Now, a lot of my family has served.
[03:27:27.754 --> 03:27:29.235]  A lot of my family are veterans.
[03:27:29.235 --> 03:27:29.695]  I am not.
[03:27:30.758 --> 03:27:32.319]  I love all the veterans.
[03:27:32.319 --> 03:27:36.842]  My favorite, I posted this yesterday online, my favorite is my grandfather who I never met.
[03:27:36.842 --> 03:27:40.805]  He didn't die in service, but he died after his service to our country.
[03:27:40.805 --> 03:27:41.846]  He's a veteran.
[03:27:41.846 --> 03:27:56.956]  Talked to my children about Veterans Day at the dinner table on Sunday and was unfortunately not very shocked to find out that it was not discussed at school on Thursday or Friday.
[03:27:56.956 --> 03:27:58.938]  Veterans Day was not discussed in school.
[03:28:00.242 --> 03:28:07.748]  The governor's working on cards for the people in the service, but yet the school system isn't even talking about Veterans Day.
[03:28:07.748 --> 03:28:20.039]  And then we have people being shot in the streets and the governors and the mayors aren't doing anything about it because they're working on making sure that people get cards in the mail.
[03:28:21.155 --> 03:28:22.116]  Talk to a veteran.
[03:28:22.116 --> 03:28:24.458]  Talk to somebody who's active military.
[03:28:24.458 --> 03:28:28.240]  Ask them if they give a crap about getting a card in the mail.
[03:28:28.240 --> 03:28:33.444]  Ask them what they prefer, and you'll find out that they care more about what's happening in the United States.
[03:28:33.444 --> 03:28:44.853]  We're going to talk about how that's been dripped in, exactly how that agenda's been perpetrated through the media for men dressing as women, making it completely normal and
[03:28:45.855 --> 03:28:48.161]  And diminishing the status of the veterans.
[03:28:48.161 --> 03:28:51.610]  Coming up on InfoWars, in for Alex Jones from Chicago.
[03:28:51.610 --> 03:28:52.753]  It's Matt Dugiel from Vegas.
[03:28:53.948 --> 03:28:55.409]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.
[03:28:55.409 --> 03:28:59.171]  The NSA has noticed how much time you spend on conservative news sites.

[03:29:53.556 --> 03:29:56.677]  America is an information-based civil war.
[03:29:56.677 --> 03:30:04.120]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[03:30:04.120 --> 03:30:09.722]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[03:30:10.462 --> 03:30:18.169]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[03:30:18.169 --> 03:30:26.757]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[03:30:26.757 --> 03:30:31.821]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[03:30:31.821 --> 03:30:33.303]  They are the anti-liberals.
[03:30:33.943 --> 03:30:38.305]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide.

[03:32:36.822 --> 03:32:40.664]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[03:32:40.664 --> 03:32:41.764]  It is an act of war.
[03:32:41.764 --> 03:32:43.825]  It is an act of standing up.
[03:32:43.825 --> 03:32:55.010]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[03:32:55.010 --> 03:32:57.691]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:12.059 --> 03:33:19.441]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.441 --> 03:33:24.722]  It's Matt Dubio filling in for Alex Jones, and I'm damn glad to be here.
[03:33:24.722 --> 03:33:30.044]  From Chicago, from the front lines in Chicago where the death toll in 2017 is 14 for the month.
[03:33:30.044 --> 03:33:33.325]  We have 14 killed and shot in Chicago, 562 for the whole year so far.
[03:33:39.167 --> 03:33:41.229]  And it really is the front lines in Chicago.
[03:33:41.229 --> 03:33:46.396]  It's a preview of what's coming to American cities around the country.
[03:33:46.396 --> 03:33:50.521]  Detroit, the South, the West, the East.
[03:33:50.521 --> 03:33:51.322]  It's a warning.
[03:33:52.196 --> 03:34:05.399]  It's a warning to you, wherever you are, whether it's a Democratic mayor or a Republican mayor or a Democratic governor or a Republican governor, that they're not going to be focusing on the right things.
[03:34:05.399 --> 03:34:17.043]  They're going to inevitably be focusing on the wrong things, whatever those things are that gets them in front of the feel-good mainstream media that will write a story about them sending out cards to the veterans.
[03:34:17.043 --> 03:34:18.303]  The veterans don't need cards!
[03:34:18.803 --> 03:34:19.844]  You know what they need?
[03:34:19.844 --> 03:34:21.224]  They need better health care.
[03:34:21.224 --> 03:34:24.266]  They need not to be ignored when they get back to the United States of America.
[03:34:24.266 --> 03:34:30.409]  They need to not be held up as the scum of the country when they come back from serving us.
[03:34:30.409 --> 03:34:37.873]  They need to be put on a pedestal and aided in their transition from serving the country into adjusting to private life.
[03:34:37.873 --> 03:34:38.794]  That's what they need.
[03:34:38.794 --> 03:34:42.716]  They need to be treated like human beings deserve to be treated.
[03:34:42.716 --> 03:34:48.139]  The cards are a nice effort, and it's a feel-good, and it gets a good headline, but it's not enough.
[03:34:48.739 --> 03:35:10.050]  Very important that you know this there's some specials that are that have ended okay at Infowarsstore.com They've ended some specials including 50% off all apparel and 50% off super male vitality All right, so because it was so big they had to they had to cut it off They say it's for a limited time and that's it but here's what's available and here's why it's important when Keith Richards
[03:35:11.207 --> 03:35:13.028]  Is suffering from exhaustion.
[03:35:13.028 --> 03:35:21.090]  When you hear about Britney Spears being taken to the hospital and then they take her and they, oh she's exhausted and we had to get her, we had to get her fluids and stuff.
[03:35:21.090 --> 03:35:27.392]  One of the fluids that they'll end up giving her, one of the vitamins they'll give her and or him and others is vitamin B12.
[03:35:27.392 --> 03:35:30.793]  I am a big believer in B12 and I've experienced it personally.
[03:35:30.793 --> 03:35:32.214]  I've gotten B12 injections
[03:35:32.914 --> 03:35:37.335]  And they really help you if you're taking enough vitamin D, especially in the winter months.
[03:35:37.335 --> 03:35:39.616]  You get your vitamin D up because you're not getting it from the sun.
[03:35:39.616 --> 03:35:45.718]  You get the B12 in and before you know it, you're feeling like a human being and maybe even superhuman again.
[03:35:45.718 --> 03:35:50.759]  Secret 12 is the vitamin B that you can put under your tongue.
[03:35:50.759 --> 03:35:52.320]  They call it sublingual.
[03:35:52.320 --> 03:35:57.081]  So there's 50% off right now with free shipping at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:35:58.340 --> 03:36:04.825]  So you might have heard Alex today talking about some, I don't know if you can say tranny on Facebook.
[03:36:04.825 --> 03:36:08.608]  It sounds like men in drag and tranny was banned by Facebook.
[03:36:08.608 --> 03:36:10.870]  So let's just call it what it is.
[03:36:10.870 --> 03:36:13.753]  Grown men dressing as women.
[03:36:13.753 --> 03:36:20.658]  And grown men dressing up as women, grown men pretending to be women, is something that is not new.
[03:36:20.658 --> 03:36:23.941]  It's been happening for hundreds and thousands of years.
[03:36:25.058 --> 03:36:33.841]  And it's just actually been normalized, though, over the last 40 to 50 years, and they've done it very systematically.
[03:36:33.841 --> 03:36:36.282]  And this is important to note.
[03:36:36.282 --> 03:36:46.466]  It doesn't mean that everybody who's participated in the movie or in the media is complicit in the sort of shift
[03:36:47.324 --> 03:36:54.870]  The public consciousness shift doesn't mean that they all did it on purpose, because I'm going to mention some things and you're going to go, wait a minute.
[03:36:54.870 --> 03:36:57.532]  So-and-so is a good dude and that guy's not a bad guy.
[03:36:57.532 --> 03:37:01.295]  And I'm not saying that they're complicit in the architecture of it.
[03:37:01.295 --> 03:37:07.741]  But what happens is, is when it becomes popularized, then it's hijacked for their general mission.
[03:37:07.741 --> 03:37:09.282]  And I'm going to take you back to the beginning.
[03:37:10.350 --> 03:37:10.810]  Right?
[03:37:10.810 --> 03:37:14.991]  Now, imagine the 1950s and the 1960s.
[03:37:14.991 --> 03:37:19.152]  Imagine the world in the 1950s and the 1960s.
[03:37:19.152 --> 03:37:23.213]  Imagine the world of Ozzie and Harriet, because that's pretty much the world that we lived in.
[03:37:23.213 --> 03:37:33.555]  You had white-collar men who wore a suit and tie, and they wore a fedora hat, much like Jimmy Stewart in many of the movies, especially, you know, like, It's a Wonderful Life.
[03:37:33.555 --> 03:37:35.476]  You had men that wore white collar,
[03:37:36.516 --> 03:37:38.637]  Wearing suits and ties and hats.
[03:37:38.637 --> 03:37:39.978]  Dressing like men.
[03:37:39.978 --> 03:37:50.083]  Then you had men that were blue-collar, and the blue-collar men, this is very cliche, but they might have had some scruff, and they might have had a uniform on.
[03:37:50.083 --> 03:37:52.825]  And those men looked like men.
[03:37:52.825 --> 03:37:59.068]  And if you showed them a man dressed as a woman, they would immediately reject that.
[03:37:59.068 --> 03:38:00.749]  So, what happened?
[03:38:00.749 --> 03:38:02.069]  In 1959, there was a movie that came out,
[03:38:04.275 --> 03:38:07.958]  With Tony Curtis, and the movie was called Some Like It Hot.
[03:38:07.958 --> 03:38:09.119]  Now, this is before my time.
[03:38:09.119 --> 03:38:11.682]  I was born in... I was born in the 70s, man.
[03:38:11.682 --> 03:38:16.526]  Uh, Some Like It Hot is a movie about a couple of guys dressing like women.
[03:38:16.526 --> 03:38:20.670]  Now, here's what they did, and here's how these ideas are transferred, okay?
[03:38:20.670 --> 03:38:24.653]  They don't just say that they're going to have them dress like men for fun.
[03:38:24.653 --> 03:38:27.556]  Now the story is, well, what if they had to dress like men?
[03:38:28.104 --> 03:38:31.667]  What if there was a reason for these men to dress like women?
[03:38:31.667 --> 03:38:35.549]  And the reason is, that they witnessed a mob hit.
[03:38:35.549 --> 03:38:38.291]  So now they're changing, they're shifting the idea.
[03:38:38.291 --> 03:38:49.198]  They're saying, men of America, masculine men of America, and women of America, and elderly of America, would it be okay if men dressed as women?
[03:38:49.198 --> 03:38:51.600]  As long as it was for a good reason.
[03:38:51.600 --> 03:38:54.242]  Like in this story, where they're fleeing the mafia.
[03:38:54.972 --> 03:39:01.535]  Two men witness a mob hit, they flee the mafia, and they flee in an all-female band.
[03:39:01.535 --> 03:39:06.977]  So they had to dress as women to disguise themselves as part of the all-female band.
[03:39:06.977 --> 03:39:08.317]  That was the ruse.
[03:39:08.317 --> 03:39:10.878]  It was for survival.
[03:39:10.878 --> 03:39:14.880]  Is it okay to dress like a woman if it's for survival?
[03:39:14.880 --> 03:39:17.021]  And most rational men and women would say, well,
[03:39:17.808 --> 03:39:25.012]  Okay, I suppose that if you're dressing like a woman to survive, it would be okay to dress like a woman.
[03:39:25.012 --> 03:39:29.134]  It would not be okay to dress like a woman for fun.
[03:39:29.134 --> 03:39:42.641]  It would not be okay to dress like a woman if you're teaching class, or if you're working your day job at the ad agency, or if you're working on Wall Street, or if you're working in the union stockyards, or if you're installing electricity.
[03:39:42.641 --> 03:39:44.783]  You can't dress like a woman there.
[03:39:44.783 --> 03:39:45.423]  Not for fun.
[03:39:46.368 --> 03:39:57.217]  But, if you watch some like it hot, the message is that it's okay to dress like women, if you're a man, if it's for survival.
[03:39:57.217 --> 03:40:04.243]  And so they let that idea sort of simmer, and that idea kind of just sat there, and people watched the movie.
[03:40:04.243 --> 03:40:04.803]  Fast forward to 1982.
[03:40:04.803 --> 03:40:06.305]  1982, a movie came out with Dustin Hoffman.
[03:40:10.262 --> 03:40:11.884]  The Graduate.
[03:40:11.884 --> 03:40:24.616]  And by the way, it is never a coincidence that the men that dress up as the women in the movies are some of the most masculine and revered men playing some of the most masculine roles ever played.
[03:40:24.616 --> 03:40:33.045]  Now, Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate played a young man who bedded an older woman, which was a fantasy of many young men.
[03:40:34.153 --> 03:40:41.899]  Who, as a young man in that time, wouldn't have LOVED to have an older, attractive woman be interested in them?
[03:40:41.899 --> 03:40:45.342]  And now, in 1982, that same young man, who in 1967 was everybody's fan, they wanted to be him in 1967.
[03:40:45.342 --> 03:40:49.025]  Now in 1982, Dustin Hoffman is playing Tootsie, a man that dresses like a woman,
[03:40:59.833 --> 03:41:01.414]  But not for fun.
[03:41:01.414 --> 03:41:02.595]  He's not doing it for fun.
[03:41:02.595 --> 03:41:04.577]  This is an important distinction.
[03:41:04.577 --> 03:41:06.839]  It's not a pleasurable experience.
[03:41:06.839 --> 03:41:10.141]  That is too weird for mainstream America.
[03:41:10.141 --> 03:41:12.063]  They're escalating you, okay?
[03:41:12.063 --> 03:41:19.509]  So first, Tony Curtis, a very masculine man with a very square jaw, revered by men.
[03:41:19.509 --> 03:41:21.130]  And women!
[03:41:21.130 --> 03:41:22.832]  Tony Curtis dresses as a woman.
[03:41:22.832 --> 03:41:24.593]  Along with, is that Jack?
[03:41:24.593 --> 03:41:25.534]  I think it's Jack Lemmon.
[03:41:26.784 --> 03:41:30.925]  Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, for crying out loud, are dressing like women.
[03:41:30.925 --> 03:41:36.346]  And it's okay, because in the movie, their characters are dressing like women.
[03:41:36.346 --> 03:41:36.686]  Why?
[03:41:36.686 --> 03:41:38.067]  To escape the mob.
[03:41:38.067 --> 03:41:39.247]  So it's for survival.
[03:41:39.247 --> 03:41:40.027]  It's cool.
[03:41:40.027 --> 03:41:41.648]  Survival is cool.
[03:41:41.648 --> 03:41:42.328]  It's cool.
[03:41:42.328 --> 03:41:45.189]  Dressing like a woman is cool if you're trying to survive.
[03:41:45.189 --> 03:41:50.810]  B. Secondly, in the movie Tootsie, why is Dustin Hoffman dressing like a woman?
[03:41:50.810 --> 03:41:54.031]  He's dressing like a woman, again, for survival.
[03:41:54.031 --> 03:41:54.971]  He can't get a job!
[03:41:55.794 --> 03:41:56.774]  He cannot get a job.
[03:41:56.774 --> 03:41:58.135]  He can't get hired.
[03:41:58.135 --> 03:41:59.616]  They're cutting back.
[03:41:59.616 --> 03:42:00.996]  You gotta be a woman to work.
[03:42:00.996 --> 03:42:02.897]  I think he was in the newsroom.
[03:42:02.897 --> 03:42:09.300]  And in order for him to actually, oh no, he's an unsuccessful actor in the movie.
[03:42:09.300 --> 03:42:15.022]  And in order for him to get work, he has to dress like a woman.
[03:42:15.022 --> 03:42:17.283]  My friend, it does not stop there.
[03:42:18.138 --> 03:42:19.779]  It does not stop there.
[03:42:19.779 --> 03:42:20.919]  This is just the beginning.
[03:42:20.919 --> 03:42:22.660]  I'm going to take you all the way through it.
[03:42:22.660 --> 03:42:23.440]  And you're going to see.
[03:42:23.440 --> 03:42:23.980]  Yep.
[03:42:23.980 --> 03:42:24.280]  Yep.
[03:42:24.280 --> 03:42:25.020]  Look at the screen.

[03:42:27.761 --> 03:42:30.242]  You can kind of get an idea of where we're going with this stuff.
[03:42:30.242 --> 03:42:32.043]  It's just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:42:32.043 --> 03:42:34.384]  Dave Chappelle witnessed it firsthand.
[03:42:34.384 --> 03:42:35.984]  Others have talked about it.
[03:42:35.984 --> 03:42:39.105]  You're going to realize that it's everywhere.
[03:42:39.105 --> 03:42:44.647]  It's been surrounding you now for better than two or three or four decades.

[03:46:55.514 --> 03:46:58.115]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.382 --> 03:47:29.211]  I don't tweet much, but if there's a place where you can find me or follow me, you might want to do it there.
[03:47:29.211 --> 03:47:39.758]  Broadcasting from the WCKG studios here in Chicago, we carry Alex Jones, we carry Real News with David Knight, and what I'm talking about today, on the heels of this
[03:47:41.033 --> 03:47:56.083]  This phenomenon of men wearing dresses, men pretending to be women in mainstream America, have just been sort of outlining my observation about the sort of escalation of this concept into the mainstream.
[03:47:56.083 --> 03:48:00.546]  It started, as far as I can tell, right about 1959.
[03:48:00.546 --> 03:48:03.649]  And I'm glad that we're talking about it.
[03:48:03.649 --> 03:48:07.731]  Infowars.com slash show if you want to see visually what we're talking about.
[03:48:09.549 --> 03:48:24.886]  One of the things that happens when you start talking about ideas, this is one of the reasons why things really, it really is an info war, such a brilliant title, such a brilliant idea, is that the information is been seeping into the consciousness.
[03:48:25.426 --> 03:48:26.246]  We're good to go.
[03:48:54.261 --> 03:48:59.549]  Okay, that idea seeps into the consciousness of men and women in America and the rest of the world.
[03:48:59.549 --> 03:49:06.899]  Jim, one of our producers and pretty much a jack-of-all-trades here at WCKG, popped in and he said, what about Psycho?
[03:49:06.899 --> 03:49:07.680]  The movie Psycho, 1960.
[03:49:07.680 --> 03:49:07.921]  Yes, Norman!
[03:49:10.862 --> 03:49:12.063]  Norman!
[03:49:12.063 --> 03:49:13.424]  Norman dressed as his mother.
[03:49:13.424 --> 03:49:15.645]  He dressed as a woman and killed people.
[03:49:15.645 --> 03:49:27.712]  Now, that took it in a weird direction, but Psycho was such a breakthrough hit that that took dressing as a woman, again, into your mind, into the subconscious of Americans as...
[03:49:28.604 --> 03:49:38.628]  This is something that people on TV, people on the movies, that they're doing it, and if you're doing it for a cause, if you're doing it for something, it's not as weird.
[03:49:38.628 --> 03:49:40.089]  It's not as weird for some reason.
[03:49:40.089 --> 03:49:42.870]  Then you jump to 1982.
[03:49:42.870 --> 03:49:48.732]  1982, Dustin Hoffman plays a character, and the character is, uh, can't get work.
[03:49:48.732 --> 03:49:49.953]  And since he can't get work,
[03:49:51.292 --> 03:49:52.974]  He's in there with Jessica Lange.
[03:49:52.974 --> 03:50:01.501]  And by the way, it's always, always, always masculine, revered actors and characters that have played other roles that have really touched you.
[03:50:01.501 --> 03:50:04.403]  They've really found a place in your heart.
[03:50:04.403 --> 03:50:08.667]  So Dustin Hoffman was the graduate before that.
[03:50:08.667 --> 03:50:11.469]  And then in 1967, fast forward to 1982, Dustin Hoffman is an unsuccessful actor.
[03:50:16.957 --> 03:50:23.761]  And then you listen to the subtext of this really is, the unsuccessful guy has to dress as a woman.
[03:50:23.761 --> 03:50:24.961]  But people kind of miss that.
[03:50:24.961 --> 03:50:27.783]  Okay, they miss out on that part.
[03:50:27.783 --> 03:50:32.926]  Unsuccessful man has to dress as woman in order to get work.
[03:50:32.926 --> 03:50:38.729]  How about instead of dressing like, well, you just get become successful, force yourself to be successful.
[03:50:38.729 --> 03:50:42.691]  But the real headline that most people gloved on to here is,
[03:50:44.691 --> 03:50:48.134]  It's okay to dress as a woman.
[03:50:48.134 --> 03:50:50.075]  Dustin Hoffman says it's okay.
[03:50:50.075 --> 03:50:51.737]  The idea is okay.
[03:50:51.737 --> 03:50:53.638]  The movie theater says it's okay.
[03:50:53.638 --> 03:50:57.401]  The commercial on ABC, CBS, and NBC says it's okay.
[03:50:57.401 --> 03:50:58.662]  They're showing it everywhere.
[03:50:58.662 --> 03:51:00.083]  They're promoting the movie everywhere.
[03:51:00.083 --> 03:51:01.344]  It might have won some awards.
[03:51:01.344 --> 03:51:02.825]  It might have won an Oscar.
[03:51:02.825 --> 03:51:03.406]  Who knows?
[03:51:04.620 --> 03:51:15.905]  And that normalizes this behavior, and the subtext there is, well, he's trying to get work, so that makes it okay, and that gives it a reason.
[03:51:15.905 --> 03:51:17.406]  He's not doing it for fun.
[03:51:17.406 --> 03:51:19.166]  We're skipping over the fun part.
[03:51:19.166 --> 03:51:22.548]  There's guys that like to do this for fun, but we're not ready for that.
[03:51:22.748 --> 03:51:24.950]  Okay, so then we jump ahead to 1980.
[03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:32.196]  And I remember this because I was a TV kid in the 80s watching too much television.
[03:51:32.196 --> 03:51:34.958]  And I remember the show with Tom Hanks and the other guy.
[03:51:34.958 --> 03:51:37.360]  I don't remember the other guy's name.
[03:51:37.360 --> 03:51:40.603]  And they couldn't get an apartment.
[03:51:40.603 --> 03:51:43.165]  I believe it was like in rent-controlled New York.
[03:51:43.165 --> 03:51:46.127]  So the show was called Bosom Buddies.
[03:51:46.127 --> 03:51:48.669]  So they dressed like women.
[03:51:48.669 --> 03:51:51.652]  Tom Hanks and the other actor dressed like women.
[03:51:52.660 --> 03:51:55.261]  In order to get an apartment.
[03:51:55.261 --> 03:51:56.982]  Okay, so are you following me here?
[03:51:56.982 --> 03:52:01.204]  It's okay to dress like a woman if you need to survive from the mob.
[03:52:01.204 --> 03:52:04.206]  It's okay to dress like a woman if you need to get work.
[03:52:04.206 --> 03:52:05.486]  Now, it's okay.
[03:52:05.486 --> 03:52:06.587]  We're escalating it.
[03:52:06.587 --> 03:52:08.128]  It's okay to dress like a woman.
[03:52:08.128 --> 03:52:11.329]  Yeah, Peter Scolari and Tom Hanks.
[03:52:11.329 --> 03:52:13.691]  Peter didn't make it, but Tom Hanks did.
[03:52:13.691 --> 03:52:18.513]  And he probably was even more elevated because he was willing to do this show.
[03:52:18.513 --> 03:52:20.514]  They wanted to put this show out for whatever reason.
[03:52:21.972 --> 03:52:27.454]  Now it's okay to dress like a woman in order to get an apartment.
[03:52:27.454 --> 03:52:31.395]  And of course, hilarity ensues and the comedy ensues.
[03:52:31.395 --> 03:52:37.616]  It is a funny situation to put people into and that is the excuse to do it.
[03:52:37.616 --> 03:52:38.817]  As they're going, well, it's funny.
[03:52:38.817 --> 03:52:39.557]  It's so funny.
[03:52:39.557 --> 03:52:40.537]  It's just funny.
[03:52:40.537 --> 03:52:41.838]  It's just so hilarious.
[03:52:41.838 --> 03:52:47.999]  So what we do is we take the two guys and we put them in these crazy situations, but they're dressed as women.
[03:52:47.999 --> 03:52:50.280]  So they're pretending to be women, but they're really men.
[03:52:50.860 --> 03:52:55.964]  And you can see their 5 o'clock shadow, and they're on TV once a week, every week.
[03:52:55.964 --> 03:53:00.447]  And by the way, back then, there was only three channels.
[03:53:00.447 --> 03:53:02.449]  There was not 300 channels.
[03:53:02.449 --> 03:53:05.191]  You couldn't put on Hulu and Netflix.
[03:53:05.191 --> 03:53:09.454]  This was all you could watch, and it's seeping in, into mainstream America.
[03:53:09.454 --> 03:53:10.795]  Everybody's watching this stuff.
[03:53:10.795 --> 03:53:12.636]  With Dukes of Hazzard, by the way.
[03:53:12.636 --> 03:53:14.458]  So you got Dukes of Hazzard, you got Bosom Buddies.
[03:53:14.458 --> 03:53:14.678]  Thank you.
[03:53:15.942 --> 03:53:22.026]  Fast forward to, again, and then you got the movie Yentl with, uh, you know, we gotta mix it up a little bit.
[03:53:22.026 --> 03:53:26.049]  So we get Barbara Streisand dressing as a man.
[03:53:26.049 --> 03:53:31.013]  Again, for, I think it's survival in that movie, I'm not too sure, but there's a reason.
[03:53:31.013 --> 03:53:32.414]  It's not for fun.
[03:53:32.414 --> 03:53:34.115]  None of this is for fun or recreation.
[03:53:35.422 --> 03:53:41.808]  Now, Jen mentioned the Crying Game, which came out in 1992, and I have to admit, I didn't see it.
[03:53:41.808 --> 03:53:55.580]  I just heard everybody, people joking about the Crying Game, because I think there's a, there's a, something happens in the Crying Game where a man maybe ends up with, he's with a woman that he didn't know was a woman, or something like that.
[03:53:55.580 --> 03:53:59.124]  So now we're escalating the situation.
[03:53:59.124 --> 03:54:00.585]  It's a very different situation.
[03:54:01.659 --> 03:54:05.006]  It's transitioning, pun intended.
[03:54:05.006 --> 03:54:07.511]  We're transitioning from men in dresses.
[03:54:07.511 --> 03:54:10.035]  Now, here's something that's interesting.
[03:54:10.035 --> 03:54:13.121]  Listen to what Dave Chappelle has to say.
[03:54:13.912 --> 03:54:15.072]  In an interview with Oprah.
[03:54:15.072 --> 03:54:20.734]  And I can't believe that Oprah... By the way, this was before Oprah was completely compromised or whatever.
[03:54:20.734 --> 03:54:26.556]  Where Oprah actually takes a listen to what Dave Chappelle has to say and watch her reaction.
[03:54:26.556 --> 03:54:27.677]  She doesn't poo-poo it.
[03:54:27.677 --> 03:54:30.318]  She doesn't say, oh Dave, well that's just the way Hollywood is.
[03:54:30.318 --> 03:54:31.698]  She actually listens to it.
[03:54:31.698 --> 03:54:38.920]  And Dave Chappelle talks about the writers and producers trying to get him to wear a dress in a movie after he was already successful.
[03:54:38.920 --> 03:54:41.481]  Go ahead and roll that if you can.
[03:54:41.481 --> 03:54:43.042]  I mean, I'm a conspiracy
[03:54:43.897 --> 03:54:46.199]  There is, to a degree.
[03:54:46.199 --> 03:54:49.722]  Like, when I connect dots that maybe shouldn't be connected, I don't know.
[03:54:49.722 --> 03:54:56.427]  But certain dots, like, when I see that they put every black man in the movies in a dress at some point in their career, I'll be connecting that.
[03:54:56.427 --> 03:54:56.687]  I'm done.
[03:54:56.687 --> 03:54:58.869]  Like, why all these brothers gotta wear a dress?
[03:54:58.869 --> 03:55:00.510]  This happened to me.
[03:55:00.510 --> 03:55:01.852]  I'm doing a movie with Martin.
[03:55:01.852 --> 03:55:02.452]  Yeah.
[03:55:02.452 --> 03:55:04.093]  The movie's going good.
[03:55:04.093 --> 03:55:05.635]  So I walk in the trailer.
[03:55:05.635 --> 03:55:10.178]  I'm like, man, this must be the wrong trailer, because there's a dress in here.
[03:55:10.178 --> 03:55:12.540]  Look at her face.
[03:55:12.540 --> 03:55:13.441]  Look at Oprah's face.
[03:55:14.148 --> 03:55:15.388]  The writer comes in.
[03:55:15.388 --> 03:55:16.169]  I think he's a writer.
[03:55:16.169 --> 03:55:17.849]  He's like, Dave, listen.
[03:55:17.849 --> 03:55:25.151]  You got this hilarious scene where Martin's sneaking out of jail, so he disguises you as a prostitute.
[03:55:25.151 --> 03:55:27.212]  Okay, so can we pause it for a second?
[03:55:27.212 --> 03:55:28.672]  I want to continue from there.
[03:55:28.672 --> 03:55:32.653]  Okay, so the writer, you know, this is how it starts.
[03:55:32.653 --> 03:55:34.014]  And you saw Oprah's face.
[03:55:34.734 --> 03:55:48.568]  Now, they're trying to get, and the prelude, the preview to that was Dave Chappelle saying that he noticed that all of these successful, masculine, and he was speaking to black actors and celebrities.
[03:55:49.292 --> 03:55:54.499]  And he was saying, I noticed that they were doing this with all of these big stars that are black.
[03:55:54.499 --> 03:55:56.541]  They're always ending up wearing dresses.
[03:55:56.541 --> 03:55:59.505]  And then he segues into telling Oprah that this has happened.
[03:55:59.505 --> 03:56:00.887]  And then you see Oprah kind of looking.
[03:56:00.887 --> 03:56:04.291]  Back then, Oprah looked at this sort of thing and went, wait a minute.
[03:56:05.129 --> 03:56:08.251]  Try and see a segment where Oprah talks about this now.
[03:56:08.251 --> 03:56:11.173]  She's going to have a different reaction and a different attitude.
[03:56:11.173 --> 03:56:11.874]  Why?
[03:56:11.874 --> 03:56:13.535]  Because it's been escalated.
[03:56:13.535 --> 03:56:15.236]  It's completely been altered.
[03:56:15.236 --> 03:56:23.062]  Everybody, even Oprah's position on this, has been changed by the media and by the perpetuation of this.
[03:56:23.062 --> 03:56:26.925]  I'm not going to have enough time to probably play the rest of that clip, but
[03:56:28.203 --> 03:56:31.046]  Then you got Priscilla, the Queen of the Desert.
[03:56:31.046 --> 03:56:34.810]  Tu Wong Fu with love, Julie Newmar in 1995.
[03:56:34.810 --> 03:56:35.891]  White Chicks.
[03:56:35.891 --> 03:56:42.098]  And before that in 1993, I'm sorry I'm jumping around guys, but in 1993 you had Mrs. Doubtfire.
[03:56:42.098 --> 03:56:49.606]  Now, again, in the storyline of Mrs. Doubtfire, it's totally cool to dress like a woman, if it's so you can see your kids.
[03:56:50.820 --> 03:57:02.187]  If dad has to do that so that he can see his kids because some wacko judge told him that he can't see his kids, well then, I mean, who can't identify with that?
[03:57:02.187 --> 03:57:04.309]  I would do almost whatever I could to see my kids.
[03:57:04.309 --> 03:57:07.191]  How can you not relate to that?
[03:57:07.191 --> 03:57:08.812]  You see what's happening?
[03:57:08.812 --> 03:57:10.953]  You see the progression?
[03:57:10.953 --> 03:57:12.134]  It's now
[03:57:13.015 --> 03:57:15.840]  It's probably okay to a lot of people.
[03:57:15.840 --> 03:57:23.011]  Well, what's the harm if you're just dressing like... Why not teach people to dress like women for fun even if they're men?
[03:57:23.011 --> 03:57:23.672]  Why not?
[03:57:23.672 --> 03:57:24.674]  What's the harm?
[03:57:24.674 --> 03:57:26.617]  We've been escalated for so long.
[03:57:27.876 --> 03:57:35.785]  Go back and look at the history of the motion picture and entertainment industry, and you'll see from hair bands to Tony Curtis, it's been orchestrated.
[03:57:35.785 --> 03:57:43.414]  Whether on purpose or by accident, either way, it's been happening with men in dresses manipulating you.
[03:57:43.414 --> 03:57:46.097]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
