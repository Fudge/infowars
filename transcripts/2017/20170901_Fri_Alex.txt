[00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:08.261]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:10.464]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:11.585]  Government coverage.
[00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:13.668]  Wow, it's September 1st already?
[00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:15.530]  You want answers?
[00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.632]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:17.473]  Amazing!
[00:00:17.473 --> 00:00:23.761]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:28.685]  You know, I read these stories yesterday and people didn't believe me, but now here it is in Reuters.
[00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:32.948]  Putin warns North Korea's situation on the verge of large-scale conflict.
[00:00:32.948 --> 00:00:34.729]  That's because Trump's told him, get ready.
[00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:36.010]  This is serious.
[00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.435]  But first, Trump and the American people are vindicated Antifa are violent thugs, and it turns out the FBI's listed them as a criminal gang.
[00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:46.937]  You're a f***ing anti-American!
[00:00:46.937 --> 00:00:48.718]  I'm an anti-American?
[00:00:48.718 --> 00:00:50.220]  You stupid bastard!
[00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.881]  I'm a f***ing patriot!
[00:00:53.885 --> 00:00:56.408]  I think we should classify them as a gang.
[00:00:56.408 --> 00:00:58.790]  You know, they come dressed in uniforms.
[00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.151]  They have weapons.
[00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:02.193]  They're almost a militia.
[00:01:02.193 --> 00:01:05.497]  I think we need to think about that in terms of our law enforcement approach.
[00:01:05.497 --> 00:01:14.986]  We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides.
[00:01:14.986 --> 00:01:15.647]  On many sides.
[00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:17.046]  Wait!
[00:01:17.046 --> 00:01:19.030]  On many sides!
[00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.394]  This was a white nationalist rally!
[00:01:21.394 --> 00:01:23.378]  You have to call that out by name!
[00:01:23.378 --> 00:01:24.059]  Many sides?
[00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:31.929]  Mr. President, Mr. President, this is terrorism, not your order at KFC.
[00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.833]  Prior to the unrest, police banned sticks, masks, and any other potential weapons.
[00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:40.195]  However, dozens of anti-fascist protesters broke those rules, it appears.
[00:01:40.195 --> 00:01:43.217]  They also pepper-sprayed the leader of the conservative group.
[00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:48.942]  One left-wing demonstrator attacked a photographer, and others reportedly threatened people who were trying to film the violence.
[00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:53.485]  What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?
[00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:56.087]  Do they have any semblance of guilt?
[00:01:58.068 --> 00:01:59.229]  Let me ask you this.
[00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.153]  What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs?
[00:02:04.153 --> 00:02:06.174]  Do they have any problem?
[00:02:06.174 --> 00:02:07.015]  I think they do.
[00:02:07.015 --> 00:02:19.885]  And they are just beating people, ganging up, men and women, ganging up on lone individuals and just beating them in a wanton, savage, brown shirt, Nazi operation.
[00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:28.007]  I don't want to mention Antifa and how Antifa literally came, trained, militarized, doing war-like maneuvers.
[00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:31.808]  You know, they bring coolers and you think, oh, it's to stay hydrated.
[00:02:31.808 --> 00:02:38.130]  No, it's filled with water balloons, filled with feces, urine, just disgusting things that will pop and explode on people.
[00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.491]  And water bottles filled with the same substances.
[00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.645]  Yeah, he just got struck with pepper spray.
[00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:55.748]  That's the liberal helping him.
[00:02:55.748 --> 00:02:56.830]  I don't like this.
[00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.093]  No, you see, the guy that attacked him is not a liberal.
[00:02:59.093 --> 00:02:59.994]  He's a Marxist.
[00:02:59.994 --> 00:03:03.920]  Every time one of these situations happens, you know, you see the worst of people sometimes.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.102]  I think we saw it out of the left.
[00:03:05.542 --> 00:03:11.367]  You just saw those videos of them chasing and beating people, people in black clothing, black masks.
[00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:14.889]  Over 100 of them broke through the lines and attacked stragglers who were there.
[00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.291]  For the most part, the event was shut down.
[00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:21.314]  They couldn't find enough conservatives, so they started attacking the police after a while.
[00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:26.038]  But you saw them beating the conservatives, even as they come in, carrying no hate signs.
[00:03:26.038 --> 00:03:32.623]  And the mayor said they made sure the themes of love and compassion dominated over hate speech.
[00:03:37.307 --> 00:03:43.331]  Supporters of President Donald Trump were vastly outnumbered by counter protesters at Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:44.312]  Civic Center Park.
[00:03:44.312 --> 00:03:46.413]  And then we saw that group with the masks on.
[00:03:46.413 --> 00:03:52.618]  They had their own, you know, shields that they made, for lack of a better term.
[00:03:52.618 --> 00:03:54.480]  A huge crowd there now.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:05.222]  And while we certainly don't know, certainly, and we'll try to find out, some of those protesters, the ones that showed up with the masks and the shields, may do this in other locations.
[00:04:05.222 --> 00:04:09.303]  They may be what you call professional protesters who do this a lot.
[00:04:09.303 --> 00:04:12.264]  Again, the full report is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:04:12.264 --> 00:04:23.026]  Trump vindicated Antifa, our violent thugs, and it then goes into the clips of Pelosi and the rest of them admitting now that it is basically a terrorist organization.
[00:04:23.706 --> 00:04:36.551]  And the new report is up on Infowars.com, where it turns out even last year under Obama, they'd been secretly identified as a terrorist organization, as the primary instigators of violence and a criminal gang.
[00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:47.255]  There's really a powerful article out of the Weekly Standard of beating in Berkeley, and it actually documents how the so-called Antifa beat up mainly Japanese, black people,
[00:04:48.256 --> 00:04:55.006]  Just really mild-mannered, nice folks that came out for the free speech rally because they believe free speech is very, very important.
[00:04:55.006 --> 00:04:57.510]  And that's why it's finally blown up in their fascist faces.
[00:05:04.195 --> 00:05:11.016]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[00:05:11.016 --> 00:05:13.577]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[00:05:13.577 --> 00:05:17.037]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[00:05:17.037 --> 00:05:19.218]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:24.038]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[00:05:24.038 --> 00:05:26.919]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.140]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.941]  Unprecedented.
[00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:36.162]  And it's cold-pressed.
[00:05:36.162 --> 00:05:38.104]  That's why super mayo is so different.
[00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:42.489]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted in science and these are other what you sell.
[00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:44.451]  BuzzFeed said it's like it's already best-selling stuff.
[00:05:44.451 --> 00:05:46.513]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:47.714]  Why these aren't anything new?
[00:05:47.714 --> 00:05:51.779]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best but cold-pressed?
[00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.979]  Duh.
[00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:52.359]  Duh.
[00:05:59.608 --> 00:06:05.071]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride Toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:06:05.071 --> 00:06:07.172]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:06:07.172 --> 00:06:12.455]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:16.197]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[00:06:16.317 --> 00:06:19.760]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.943]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:06:22.943 --> 00:06:26.826]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:06:26.826 --> 00:06:33.992]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:40.017]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[00:06:40.277 --> 00:06:41.679]  Nano, silver, and more.
[00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:49.987]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[00:06:49.987 --> 00:06:58.295]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.

[00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:10.794]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:10.794 --> 00:08:14.578]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infinity War.
[00:08:43.032 --> 00:08:50.036]  We've got so much to cover today and a raft of guests that we're going to be interviewing.
[00:08:50.036 --> 00:08:59.242]  The first thing I wanted to do was basically read this headline for you.
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:19.724]  You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent.
[00:09:19.724 --> 00:09:23.767]  And nobody wants to say that, but I'll say it right now.
[00:09:23.767 --> 00:09:33.613]  You had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit, and they were very, very violent.
[00:09:33.613 --> 00:09:37.396]  Are you an advocate of this sort of confrontation?
[00:09:39.065 --> 00:09:39.686]  Yes, I am.
[00:09:39.686 --> 00:09:40.187]  Yes.
[00:09:40.187 --> 00:09:45.734]  Mark Bray is a Dartmouth professor who has studied the Antifa anti-fascist movement.
[00:09:45.734 --> 00:09:51.201]  Antifa is a far-left political movement that argues it's necessary to confront hate groups sometimes with force.
[00:09:51.201 --> 00:09:55.247]  Professor Bray is author of the new book Antifa the anti-fascist movement.
[00:09:55.447 --> 00:09:55.947]  Handbook.
[00:09:55.947 --> 00:09:58.668]  Antifa are not calling on the government to censor anyone.
[00:09:58.668 --> 00:10:10.711]  In fact, they resist the notion of turning to the government or turning to the police who we've seen have been infiltrated by white supremacists who have been sympathetic to the court's sort of return to law and order notion of fascism.
[00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:14.912]  And so the idea is the real enemies of free speech are fascists.
[00:10:14.912 --> 00:10:16.392]  We've seen that historically.
[00:10:16.392 --> 00:10:20.073]  We've seen that they're the ones that if they have their way will shut down speech.
[00:10:20.073 --> 00:10:24.394]  And it also differs in the sense that anti-fascists see this as a political struggle.
[00:10:24.574 --> 00:10:30.181]  They don't see fascism as a difference of opinion, or as kind of a different perspective to consider.
[00:10:30.181 --> 00:10:36.329]  Instead, they see fascists as the enemy, and I think that we need to come around to that notion, considering that there is no doubt what they've done historically.
[00:10:36.329 --> 00:10:38.953]  You can't say that this is both sides of violence.
[00:10:38.953 --> 00:10:39.594]  What we saw...
[00:10:40.074 --> 00:10:40.734]  I agree with you.
[00:10:40.734 --> 00:10:41.975]  I completely agree with you.
[00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.772]  There was a group the President mentioned that we haven't heard about.
[00:11:07.772 --> 00:11:09.032]  The Alt-Left.
[00:11:09.032 --> 00:11:10.353]  So who are they?
[00:11:10.353 --> 00:11:13.915]  Simply put, the Alt-Left does not exist.
[00:11:13.915 --> 00:11:20.198]  According to the Anti-Defamation League, it's a made-up term that refers to no actual group or organization.
[00:11:20.198 --> 00:11:24.761]  Many in the Alt-Right actually refer to groups when they protest them as Antifa.
[00:11:24.761 --> 00:11:26.882]  That refers to anti-fascists.
[00:11:27.242 --> 00:11:34.585]  It's a name that some groups have latched onto, borrowing from an old left-wing extreme movement that popped up in the 1960s in Germany.
[00:11:34.585 --> 00:11:38.447]  Their goal is to physically confront Nazis and white supremacists.
[00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:46.090]  By most accounts, almost all of the people protesting against the hateful bigots, the Nazis and Klansmen in Charlottesville, were peaceful.
[00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:50.652]  The hateful bigots, the Nazis and Klansmen in Charlottesville.
[00:11:50.652 --> 00:11:51.272]  To equate,
[00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:54.334]  A group that is a protest group.
[00:11:54.334 --> 00:11:55.976]  Two protest groups.
[00:11:55.976 --> 00:11:57.257]  Yes, they're both protest groups.
[00:11:57.257 --> 00:12:02.181]  And they were talking about Antifa or Antifa, however you want to pronounce it, calling them the alt-left.
[00:12:02.181 --> 00:12:04.864]  Well, that group protests fascism.
[00:12:04.864 --> 00:12:07.446]  So they were there protesting fascism.
[00:12:07.446 --> 00:12:10.028]  Maybe their tactics weren't exactly right.
[00:12:10.028 --> 00:12:16.194]  All groups like that, political groups, rights groups, protest groups, it's messy.
[00:12:16.534 --> 00:12:21.619]  Antifa are people who go and they try to push back on these guys.
[00:12:21.619 --> 00:12:23.301]  Sometimes they go too far.
[00:12:23.301 --> 00:12:25.963]  I think that that is a significant issue.
[00:12:25.963 --> 00:12:32.229]  But it is not the case that they are going around building an armed movement to go and kill people.
[00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:34.851]  You've got the violent left.
[00:12:34.851 --> 00:12:38.033]  And, by the way, Kate, what about the violent right?
[00:12:38.033 --> 00:12:39.394]  What about the violent right?
[00:12:39.394 --> 00:12:41.276]  Everybody's been talking about the right.
[00:12:41.276 --> 00:12:51.222]  Nobody's been talking except for the president and myself about the violent left and Tifa, who have been equally to blame for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville.
[00:12:51.222 --> 00:12:54.805]  Do you think that there's any moral equivalence between a neo-Nazi and anyone else?
[00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.350]  I'm not trying to make any equivalence at all.
[00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:08.733]  What I'm saying is that any group that exposes violence in a democracy where it's not necessary... Do you think anyone would have been there in Charlottesville had neo-Nazis gone there?
[00:13:08.733 --> 00:13:09.953]  No one would have been there.
[00:13:09.953 --> 00:13:22.176]  Either CNN, the mainstream media, or any Democratic politician has come out, and not even establishment Republicans, have come out and condemned the far-left group Antifa, which has been exposing violence.
[00:13:23.037 --> 00:13:24.519]  Why do you think that is, Corey?
[00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:25.680]  Maybe, is it possible?
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.062]  Because they're afraid.
[00:13:27.062 --> 00:13:28.103]  Is it possible?
[00:13:28.103 --> 00:13:36.993]  Because establishment Republicans are afraid of being labeled by CNN as racist and bigots and they know that that's exactly what you're going to do and there's only a few of us who are going to stand up to you.
[00:13:37.313 --> 00:13:48.842]  Let me just ask you, Paris said that the President's initial statement on Saturday was correct, and one of the things the President said is that there was violence on many sides.
[00:13:48.842 --> 00:13:51.084]  That's not true.
[00:13:51.084 --> 00:13:53.366]  It was not on our side at all.
[00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:54.466]  Was there violence on many sides?
[00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:55.868]  Absolutely, it was not on our side at all.
[00:13:56.648 --> 00:13:58.009]  Not at all.
[00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:58.549]  Not at all.
[00:13:58.549 --> 00:14:00.050]  That's PR strategy.
[00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:01.872]  That's sounding brass and tinkling cymbal.
[00:14:01.872 --> 00:14:05.714]  We stand in there singing This Little Light of Mine and about to get crushed.
[00:14:05.714 --> 00:14:08.516]  The light, our bodies, and our prophetic witness.
[00:14:08.516 --> 00:14:09.357]  It tripled up.
[00:14:09.357 --> 00:14:13.760]  There was no space for love and justice given that vicious hatred.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.241]  And we had the left.
[00:14:15.241 --> 00:14:16.541]  We had the anarchists.
[00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:18.303]  We had the anti-fascists.
[00:14:18.303 --> 00:14:26.228]  They were trying to both protect us, but they were also letting the neo-fascists know that there was opposition in this nation.
[00:14:26.428 --> 00:14:30.535]  And now the Morning Joe, Nancy Pelosi, the Mayor of San Francisco.
[00:14:30.535 --> 00:14:33.861]  They all have to admit
[00:14:35.185 --> 00:14:38.768]  That Antifa are equivalent to Nazis and are thugs and are horrible.
[00:14:38.768 --> 00:14:45.173]  So Donald Trump, who said, bat on both sides, decry all the bigotry, all the hate, he was correct!
[00:14:45.173 --> 00:14:47.174]  He was correct!
[00:14:47.174 --> 00:15:00.064]  And now you've got the globalists trying to abort Antifa that Soros and the foundations have been nurturing and suckling at their little fetid breasts for 20 years.
[00:15:00.064 --> 00:15:02.906]  And now they're flushing the big meth head turd.
[00:15:05.643 --> 00:15:09.224]  We've put a lot of these special reports out the last few days because they're so important.
[00:15:09.224 --> 00:15:31.153]  It really is a huge issue that the Democratic Party, multinational corporations, led by George Soros' criminal networks, that have overthrown countless nations, have actually created a giant satanist, communist, meth-head army of glow-in-the-dark ne'er-do-wells
[00:15:32.321 --> 00:15:38.021]  To go out and physically, viciously attack anybody that doesn't support total communism.
[00:15:39.141 --> 00:15:54.370]  And they're so vicious that even in cities they control, like San Francisco, they viciously attacked the police, and viciously attacked Black Lives Matter, and basically took control of the situation in San Francisco.
[00:15:54.370 --> 00:16:04.897]  And that's why, finally, after watching it in Boston, and watching it in many other cities, the Democrats are going, these people are gonna destroy us.
[00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:07.919]  And they make us look really bad, and we've lost the fight,
[00:16:09.212 --> 00:16:18.756]  Trying to sell them as knights in shining armor like Sir Lancelot, riding off to the, you know, dark tower to fight the Black Knight.
[00:16:18.756 --> 00:16:21.957]  That is not what's happening.
[00:16:21.957 --> 00:16:25.378]  And so think about what a seismic devastation this is.
[00:16:25.378 --> 00:16:28.059]  They've got several rails trying to bring down Trump.
[00:16:28.059 --> 00:16:36.603]  They want to bring down the economy, admittedly, to stopping, but we're at 3.0 growth rate, something they said we never could do, something Obama never got.
[00:16:38.848 --> 00:16:41.891]  That's what the interest rate's being raised and everything is trying to shut it down.
[00:16:41.891 --> 00:16:43.713]  They're trying to blow up the economy.
[00:16:43.713 --> 00:16:45.796]  They're trying to launch a race war.
[00:16:45.796 --> 00:16:56.027]  They're trying to launch a societal breakdown so they can be the referees that claim they're going to fix the problem they helped accelerate with accelerant.
[00:16:56.027 --> 00:16:56.648]  And then they've got
[00:16:58.032 --> 00:17:10.118]  Their other rail, and that's the whole Russia thing, and now they're back to that, even though they had to drop it the last month, and are saying, don't worry, we're going to have our own hurricane.
[00:17:10.118 --> 00:17:11.518]  That's what Dan Rather said.
[00:17:11.518 --> 00:17:13.939]  Hurricane Vladimir.
[00:17:13.939 --> 00:17:20.642]  So former CBS anchor Dan Rather, along with Tom Brokaw and others, have been dug up out of the crypt.
[00:17:20.642 --> 00:17:23.244]  They're hanging out with the cryptkeeper in.
[00:17:23.244 --> 00:17:25.765]  And he says Trump is seized with fear.
[00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.952]  Actually, it's the complete opposite.
[00:17:29.952 --> 00:17:38.218]  That Robert Mueller has correctly discovered the Hurricane Vladimir about to make landfall in Washington.
[00:17:38.218 --> 00:17:49.826]  And you've got the incredibly corrupt Attorney General of New York teamed up with old, old Mueller that covered up for all the Clinton and Obama crimes and the Saudi funding and all the rest of it.
[00:17:49.826 --> 00:17:53.089]  And, oh my gosh, shaking with fear,
[00:17:54.764 --> 00:17:57.666]  As they try to destroy the recovery and try to divide the nation.
[00:17:57.666 --> 00:18:00.847]  And here came the hurricane, a tragic event.
[00:18:00.847 --> 00:18:01.848]  Major gas shortages.
[00:18:01.848 --> 00:18:03.108]  They say there's not shortages.
[00:18:03.108 --> 00:18:12.854]  Well, I couldn't get gas this morning and every gas station I drove by, and I drove by about nine of them, didn't have gas.
[00:18:12.854 --> 00:18:16.596]  So we've got that situation going on, but it brought us together.
[00:18:17.588 --> 00:18:23.876]  And that's really got these social engineers, these Divide and Conquer experts, really upset.
[00:18:23.876 --> 00:18:27.021]  So let's go ahead and play this Dan Rather clip.
[00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:29.902]  Donald Trump is afraid.
[00:18:29.902 --> 00:18:33.764]  He's trying to exude power and strength.
[00:18:33.764 --> 00:18:38.847]  He's afraid of something that Mueller and the prosecutors are going to find out.
[00:18:38.847 --> 00:18:46.172]  And what you're seeing, time after time, is a president who is, within himself, seized with fear.
[00:18:46.172 --> 00:18:51.015]  And that's going to be, you know, a political hurricane is out there to seize him.
[00:18:51.015 --> 00:18:53.196]  We'll call it Hurricane Vladimir, if you will.
[00:18:55.276 --> 00:18:57.677]  Again, they're projecting power.
[00:18:57.677 --> 00:19:00.619]  They're turning into a regional party.
[00:19:00.619 --> 00:19:02.660]  They're being absolutely universally loathed.
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.403]  Young people are now 70% national polls against abortion.
[00:19:07.403 --> 00:19:11.606]  They're hating mainline liberals, disliking mainline conservatives.
[00:19:11.606 --> 00:19:14.767]  There's a global awakening against globalism.
[00:19:14.767 --> 00:19:17.489]  All these fundamentals are turning against them.
[00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:22.212]  As people worldwide realize, corporate crony collectivism is a nightmare.
[00:19:23.274 --> 00:19:30.143]  So we need Dan Rather, the guy that sold us on all the false wars and all the rest of it, to exude confidence.
[00:19:30.143 --> 00:19:31.264]  Dan Rather.
[00:19:31.264 --> 00:19:34.648]  Gotta start in Texas with the whole Kennedy assassination cover-up.
[00:19:34.648 --> 00:19:38.253]  Dan Rather reporting from Dallas.
[00:19:38.253 --> 00:19:39.214]  The president is dead.
[00:19:39.994 --> 00:19:44.898]  Well, he's here telling us that, oh, the troops have confidence.
[00:19:44.898 --> 00:19:46.239]  Trump's about to fall.
[00:19:46.239 --> 00:19:47.460]  Rally, rally!
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.663]  Our champions, Antifa, are our spear and standard.
[00:19:51.663 --> 00:19:55.786]  Our beautiful young warriors will crush America!
[00:19:55.786 --> 00:19:57.308]  Trump will fall!
[00:19:58.996 --> 00:20:08.547]  You want to save money in a place that gives you growth, control, and certainty without stock market risk or tax risk, and you want guarantees, and you want it all tax-free!
[00:20:08.547 --> 00:20:09.749]  That's a tall order!

[00:20:14.474 --> 00:20:17.336]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[00:20:17.336 --> 00:20:18.157]  That's true!
[00:20:18.157 --> 00:20:22.680]  But you can have tax-free access to use your life insurance while you're alive.

[00:24:23.013 --> 00:24:32.342]  We're back live ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:24:44.462 --> 00:24:51.824]  I want to go ahead and get into the geopolitical news, and I'm going to come back and get into the latest on the hurricane and the new hurricane that's forming out in the Atlantic.
[00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:56.226]  It can come across Florida into the Gulf of Mexico yet again.
[00:24:56.226 --> 00:24:57.446]  We're watching that very closely.
[00:24:57.446 --> 00:24:58.726]  But here's the big news.
[00:24:58.726 --> 00:25:06.849]  You know, I mentioned this yesterday out of the Russian news, and folks thought it was exaggerating, but it's now confirmed by Reuters.
[00:25:06.849 --> 00:25:11.490]  Putin warns North Korea's situation on verge of large-scale conflict.
[00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:13.491]  That's a way of saying large-scale war.
[00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:28.773]  Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Friday that the tense standoff between North Korea and the United States was on the verge of large-scale conflict and said it was a mistake to try to pressure the North Korea over its nuclear missile program.
[00:25:28.773 --> 00:25:37.635]  Putin, who is due to attend a summit of the BRICS nations in China next week, wrote in an article published on the Kremlin's website ahead of his trip that he favored negotiations with North Korea instead.
[00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:50.469]  It is essential to resolve the region's problems through direct dialogue involving all sides without advancing any preconditions, such as talks.
[00:25:50.469 --> 00:25:56.773]  Well, Tillerson and them have been talking about talks, but North Korea keeps threatening to nuke everybody, so you can't do talks when they're doing that.
[00:25:56.773 --> 00:25:58.815]  Provocations, pressure, and bellicose
[00:26:00.632 --> 00:26:03.313]  And offensive rhetoric is the road to nowhere.
[00:26:03.313 --> 00:26:13.815]  The situation in the Korean Peninsula has deteriorated so much that it was now balanced on the verge of a large-scale conflict, said the Russian leader.
[00:26:13.815 --> 00:26:21.857]  North Korea has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States and has recently threatened to land missiles near the U.S.
[00:26:21.857 --> 00:26:23.157]  Pacific territory of Guam.
[00:26:23.976 --> 00:26:32.838]  And Trump has said that that is a line in the sand, a possible line, that if they do that, they better be ready for retaliation.
[00:26:32.838 --> 00:26:39.499]  Then the war that we're still in, that has been a ceasefire since July of 1953, will kick off again.
[00:26:39.499 --> 00:26:52.282]  On Monday, North Korean capital, which sees joint war games with the United States and South Korea as preparations for invasion, raised the stakes in its standoff with the United States and its allies by firing an intermediate-range missile over Japan.
[00:26:53.775 --> 00:27:04.022]  In Russia's opinion, the calculation that it is possible to halt North Korea's nuclear missile programs exclusively by putting pressure on the North is erroneous and futile, Putin wrote.
[00:27:04.022 --> 00:27:20.412]  A roadmap formulated by Moscow and Beijing, which would involve North Korean stopping work on missile program in exchange for the United States and South Korea halting large-scale war games, was a way to gradually reduce tensions, wrote Putin.
[00:27:22.247 --> 00:27:38.153]  Well, we've been trying to appease North Korea for decades, and our loving leaders, the Clintons as usual, you know, it the clown's not real, it the clown's not a real metaphysical force, a space vampire, but the Clintons basically are.
[00:27:38.153 --> 00:27:42.814]  You probably have headlines, Jones says they're literal space vampires.
[00:27:42.814 --> 00:27:44.315]  They might as well be.
[00:27:44.315 --> 00:27:46.215]  Yeah, maybe they are.
[00:27:46.215 --> 00:27:47.436]  That's called trolling the media.
[00:27:48.643 --> 00:27:51.965]  Bill Clinton does look like a killer clown, though, from outer space.
[00:27:51.965 --> 00:27:55.588]  No makeup needed.
[00:27:55.588 --> 00:27:55.948]  U.S.
[00:27:55.948 --> 00:28:04.494]  bombers drill over Korean Peninsula for a third day after the latest North Korean launch, and they've simulated dropping nuclear weapons.
[00:28:04.494 --> 00:28:09.017]  And we reported this two days ago, but Reuters is doing it now, so now it's real.
[00:28:09.017 --> 00:28:09.157]  See?
[00:28:11.738 --> 00:28:18.385]  I mean, I will say Reuters is a lot more accurate than CNN, but they still have a lot of fake news.
[00:28:18.385 --> 00:28:22.970]  So that's some of the news there.
[00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.233]  Now, here's some of the news coming up.
[00:28:26.233 --> 00:28:30.177]  When I saw this, I took a double take, but it's true.
[00:28:30.177 --> 00:28:30.658]  They want
[00:28:31.874 --> 00:28:41.022]  The bases removed and taken down, and I guess the names of the bases changed, but the SPLC with its offshore bank accounts and other activities is just all-powerful.
[00:28:41.022 --> 00:28:54.193]  They run Facebook, Google, they control the algorithms, they control who can be there, who can't, they define language, they say you're alt-right, then they say that means you're a Nazi, so, you know, you get beat up by crazy people throwing feces at you.
[00:28:55.458 --> 00:28:58.461]  But the S.P.L.C.
[00:28:58.461 --> 00:29:04.326]  calls army bases, quote, Confederate monuments that must be, quote, taken down.
[00:29:04.326 --> 00:29:08.970]  Far left group, dog whistle domestic terrorism.
[00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:13.854]  That is exactly what they're doing, is dog whistling that here's the target, here's the next place to go rant and rave.
[00:29:13.854 --> 00:29:16.176]  The military, the most diverse
[00:29:17.577 --> 00:29:19.439]  Organization in our country.
[00:29:19.439 --> 00:29:21.040]  The first thing to be integrated.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.542]  And it's working just fine.
[00:29:22.542 --> 00:29:23.243]  But no!
[00:29:23.243 --> 00:29:30.389]  You're gonna need some trannies in there, need to have some race baiting, need to turn it into a big social engineering operation for the globalists.
[00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:31.410]  That is coming up.
[00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.393]  Oh, meanwhile, a man has gotten in trouble.
[00:29:35.771 --> 00:29:43.914]  He's been arrested for eating bacon in front of Muslims in Stockholm, Sweden, of course, the home of the mass Stockholm syndrome.
[00:29:43.914 --> 00:29:44.775]  That's all coming up.
[00:29:44.775 --> 00:29:48.196]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:48.196 --> 00:29:49.577]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.577 --> 00:29:52.118]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.118 --> 00:29:54.799]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.454 --> 00:30:11.275]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[00:30:11.275 --> 00:30:13.816]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[00:30:13.816 --> 00:30:17.276]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[00:30:17.276 --> 00:30:19.477]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[00:30:19.477 --> 00:30:24.297]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[00:30:24.297 --> 00:30:27.178]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[00:30:27.178 --> 00:30:31.419]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:35.200]  Unprecedented.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.421]  And it's cold-pressed.
[00:30:36.421 --> 00:30:38.363]  That's why super mayo is so different.
[00:30:38.363 --> 00:30:41.306]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted in science.
[00:30:41.306 --> 00:30:44.709]  These are other... What you sell, they... BuzzFeed said it's like, it's already best-selling stuff.
[00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.771]  It's been certified as, you know, healthy and good forever.
[00:30:46.771 --> 00:30:46.991]  Why?
[00:30:46.991 --> 00:30:47.972]  These aren't anything new.
[00:30:47.972 --> 00:30:52.036]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[00:30:52.036 --> 00:30:52.476]  Dude.
[00:30:52.476 --> 00:30:52.656]  Dude.
[00:30:59.665 --> 00:31:08.412]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[00:31:08.412 --> 00:31:08.932]  That's right.

[00:31:28.507 --> 00:31:28.687]  Woo!
[00:31:28.687 --> 00:31:29.728]  That's what I'm talking about.
[00:31:29.728 --> 00:31:38.475]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:31:38.475 --> 00:31:48.063]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:31:48.063 --> 00:31:51.526]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[00:31:51.526 --> 00:31:55.629]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[00:32:50.519 --> 00:32:51.660]  That means it's pure.

[00:32:57.361 --> 00:33:02.863]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:33:02.863 --> 00:33:09.425]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:33:09.425 --> 00:33:13.346]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:20.951 --> 00:33:29.935]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.935 --> 00:33:44.221]  You know, Paul Watson and I are in an unofficial form of competition without even knowing it.
[00:33:44.221 --> 00:33:48.283]  Because I titled a video yesterday
[00:33:50.535 --> 00:33:56.856]  The dumbest anti-Trump protester in the world.
[00:33:56.856 --> 00:34:06.898]  And he had already done a video that I didn't even know about until this morning, because I hadn't been on his YouTube channel, titled, Dumbest Anti-Trump Protesters Ever.
[00:34:06.898 --> 00:34:17.000]  So, it's a very sad form of competition, though, because we don't get off on seeing how incredibly stupid these people are.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.520]  It actually freaks us out
[00:34:20.663 --> 00:34:24.826]  Really, really bad.
[00:34:24.826 --> 00:34:28.550]  Because they are whacked out of their minds.
[00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.712]  But that video's coming up.
[00:34:31.712 --> 00:34:42.981]  But first, I want to play what one of our great new investigative journalists and reporters, an Army veteran, Jake Lloyd, went out yesterday and shot.
[00:34:42.981 --> 00:34:45.984]  The ultimate moron.
[00:34:48.018 --> 00:34:54.003]  But actually, maybe not, because a lot of these anti-Trump people aren't even able to talk.
[00:34:54.003 --> 00:35:03.251]  And this sad student at the University of Texas thinks Trump stands with Antifa.
[00:35:03.251 --> 00:35:13.821]  So we're going to be playing both of those reports here in a minute so you understand the type of raw ignorance that MSNBC and CNN are controlling.
[00:35:14.878 --> 00:35:18.341]  And understand that most of these people don't even get their news from CNN.
[00:35:18.341 --> 00:35:20.423]  They get it from the Daily Show.
[00:35:20.423 --> 00:35:34.734]  They get it from the different programs that pose as news shows, but are really government propaganda masquerading as a news show, posing as comics.
[00:35:34.734 --> 00:35:36.956]  That's all they're doing.
[00:35:36.956 --> 00:35:38.618]  And they know what they're doing.
[00:35:38.618 --> 00:35:43.582]  And so when they say anybody that supports America or supports free market is a Nazi,
[00:35:45.796 --> 00:35:58.404]  These knuckle-dragon TV heads go out on the streets of America and believe they're actually fighting Red Skull, Captain America's enemy.
[00:35:58.404 --> 00:36:05.489]  And that's what's horrifying is that there is an invincible ignorance to these people.
[00:36:05.489 --> 00:36:13.715]  We've gone out and had 99 out of 100 people sign a petition to ban dihydrogen monoxide because
[00:36:15.385 --> 00:36:21.328]  It's running off into our water, and it's going to cause excessive urination.
[00:36:21.328 --> 00:36:24.570]  Leanne McAdoo's done the piece, I've done the piece, same results.
[00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:29.352]  Penn and Teller did it first, we just recreated it.
[00:36:29.352 --> 00:36:40.278]  She interviewed over 100 people, and even one guy hit on her and said, I'm, oh absolutely I'm going to ban it, I've got a chemistry degree from Cornell.
[00:36:41.749 --> 00:36:44.670]  And she goes, so then you understand, you're talking about water.
[00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:48.372]  And he went, oh my gosh, I'm an idiot.
[00:36:48.372 --> 00:36:50.512]  And they sort of go, yeah, let's ban that, absolutely.
[00:36:50.512 --> 00:36:51.693]  How about carbon dioxide?
[00:36:51.693 --> 00:36:55.934]  Absolutely, it's so deadly, so bad, you know.
[00:36:55.934 --> 00:36:58.695]  I think it's carbon monoxide.
[00:36:58.695 --> 00:37:01.176]  So that's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:37:01.176 --> 00:37:03.717]  Very, very sad.
[00:37:03.717 --> 00:37:05.318]  But it's who we are as a society.
[00:37:07.574 --> 00:37:08.576]  And it's what we've bred.
[00:37:08.576 --> 00:37:14.667]  It's the domesticated slobs that just want a virtue signal.
[00:37:14.667 --> 00:37:16.290]  And they want our guns.
[00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:17.292]  And they want our free market.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.661]  And they will do whatever George Soros tells them.
[00:37:20.661 --> 00:37:31.586]  But how stupid does John Oliver and Trevor Noah and Colbert look going, the president didn't condemn the white supremacist when he did.
[00:37:31.586 --> 00:37:38.449]  And how dumb do you look saying Antifa didn't do anything wrong when everyone knows they are the scourge of this country.
[00:37:38.449 --> 00:37:40.931]  They are the trash of the trash.
[00:37:40.931 --> 00:37:43.412]  They are the ne'er-do-wells of the ne'er-do-wells.
[00:37:43.412 --> 00:37:47.534]  They are an amalgamation of devil worshipper losers, communists,
[00:37:48.234 --> 00:38:01.201]  drug addicts, thugs that want an excuse to go out in a gang of cowards and attack people individually.
[00:38:01.201 --> 00:38:06.224]  They are the definition of scum of the earth.
[00:38:06.224 --> 00:38:09.105]  And they don't even know that we're barreling towards a war in North Korea.
[00:38:09.105 --> 00:38:15.369]  They're cheering on the economy collapsing even though it'll hurt them because they believe they're going to have a metaphysical
[00:38:16.334 --> 00:38:20.175]  Or existential coming of age, if they can bring down Trump.
[00:38:20.175 --> 00:38:25.798]  Because Hillary was their mommy, even though in the WikiLeaks she says she hates them and they're losers.
[00:38:25.798 --> 00:38:29.819]  Even though she has disdain for them.
[00:38:29.819 --> 00:38:31.000]  That's too kind a word.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:38.022]  Even though she has disgust for them.
[00:38:38.022 --> 00:38:39.743]  Their mommy lost.
[00:38:39.743 --> 00:38:41.404]  Their power lost.
[00:38:41.404 --> 00:38:43.064]  They're feeling good.
[00:38:43.064 --> 00:38:45.005]  Their reflected glory failed.
[00:38:46.963 --> 00:38:52.225]  And now all they want is to pull down all that is strong and honorable.
[00:38:52.225 --> 00:38:59.649]  If you're some drug addict, devil worshiper, loser.
[00:38:59.649 --> 00:39:14.916]  What do you think of people with happy, healthy families going to the golf course on the weekend, or going duck hunting on the weekend, or going out and feeding the homeless on the weekend, or going to the bowling alley, just having a good time?
[00:39:16.141 --> 00:39:21.763]  What do they think of you that has your head screwed on straight and just wants to be a good member of society?
[00:39:21.763 --> 00:39:32.966]  They hate you because they're losers and they gather together in big groups to take control of government and culture so that they can rule and feel powerful and become what they're not.
[00:39:32.966 --> 00:39:39.907]  They want power but not responsibility.
[00:39:39.907 --> 00:39:44.889]  And they look at you and they see the enemy and you've given them a finger
[00:39:45.868 --> 00:39:46.548]  Not the middle finger.
[00:39:46.548 --> 00:39:48.369]  You've given them a pinky of power.
[00:39:48.369 --> 00:39:50.209]  You've acquiesced to their bullying.
[00:39:50.209 --> 00:39:53.910]  You've used the words and the terms they wanted.
[00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.471]  They told you, repudiate the Nazis.
[00:39:56.471 --> 00:39:58.412]  You're like, yeah, I don't like the Nazi shirt.
[00:39:58.412 --> 00:39:59.312]  All right.
[00:39:59.312 --> 00:40:01.833]  Repudiate the family.
[00:40:01.833 --> 00:40:03.893]  Repudiate free market.
[00:40:03.893 --> 00:40:05.694]  Repudiate God.
[00:40:05.694 --> 00:40:08.015]  Repudiate free speech.
[00:40:08.015 --> 00:40:09.675]  Talk exactly as we say.
[00:40:09.675 --> 00:40:10.976]  Follow our orders.
[00:40:10.976 --> 00:40:11.796]  Grovel to us.
[00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:14.305]  They're like, I'm not going to do that.
[00:40:14.305 --> 00:40:15.625]  And they go, you know what then?
[00:40:15.625 --> 00:40:17.987]  We're going to hit you in the head with a club or a bike lock.
[00:40:17.987 --> 00:40:23.531]  We're going to throw feces on you, like satanic monkeys.
[00:40:23.531 --> 00:40:40.502]  And we're going to take control of government as if you, the scummiest, ne'er-do-well, race-baiting filth of the earth, the droppings of an old, twisted Nazi collaborator, the skin flakes that fall off the butt of
[00:40:41.701 --> 00:40:53.491]  George Soros and his little gremlin son, you are the literal servants of the vampire pedophile class.
[00:40:53.491 --> 00:40:58.335]  And so you look exactly what you think servants of vampires would look like.
[00:40:58.335 --> 00:41:06.902]  Super white skin to the point it's green, black hoods, stinking, hating, attacking, viciously covering your faces.
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:16.347]  And I'm not bashing people that like to wear black or like horror films or, you know, whatever.
[00:41:16.347 --> 00:41:25.176]  I'm talking about the particular folks that have taken on that garb as a group and who go out hissing and attacking and viciously striking out.
[00:41:26.127 --> 00:41:34.573]  And claiming that they're the guardians and the holders of all that's good and all that's cultural and they will dictate to everyone the way it is.
[00:41:34.573 --> 00:41:42.539]  And they're going to pull down civilization and somehow they're going to rule this new dark age.
[00:41:42.539 --> 00:41:43.640]  Well, they've been rejected.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.502]  So I'm going to play those clips in a moment.
[00:41:48.567 --> 00:41:50.228]  Limited-time Flash Special.
[00:41:50.228 --> 00:41:54.132]  It will end on Monday, because we have to, because we're selling out of Super Mel Vitality.
[00:41:54.132 --> 00:41:56.914]  We had the same special a month ago, Super Female, for four days.
[00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:58.855]  It sold out.
[00:41:58.855 --> 00:42:01.518]  Limited supplies back in, but it's not discounted to this level.
[00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:08.704]  I've never done it 57%, because it's so close to cost, because I want you to experience cold-pressed, known herbs.
[00:42:09.824 --> 00:42:16.292]  that have been absolutely linked, and I've certainly experienced it, to stamina, libido, energy, you name it.
[00:42:16.292 --> 00:42:19.435]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or AAA253-3139.
[00:42:28.726 --> 00:42:32.067]  SuperMetal Vitality is a game-changing formula that I myself use.
[00:42:32.067 --> 00:42:40.530]  With over 3,500 authentic reviews approved by our third-party review site, SuperMetal Vitality now sits at an unprecedented 4.6 star average.
[00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:45.893]  Visit Infowarslife.com and read the reviews for yourself and see what SuperMetal Vitality has done for our other listeners.
[00:42:45.893 --> 00:42:46.653]  It's key to do that.
[00:42:47.253 --> 00:42:48.054]  We're good to go.
[00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:12.351]  Emmerich's Essentials is 50% off, 25% off off the top.
[00:43:12.351 --> 00:43:15.292]  Sign up for AutoShip initial 25% off on that order.
[00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:17.193]  You can cancel right after you order if you want.
[00:43:17.193 --> 00:43:19.554]  Sign up every 30 days, every 60, every 90.
[00:43:19.554 --> 00:43:25.796]  You can cancel any time, but that's the type of stuff like shampoo and body wash and things that are totally organic, made right here in America.
[00:43:25.796 --> 00:43:31.738]  Our SPF 30 zinc oxide sunscreen, non-nano, DEET-free herbal bug spray works great.
[00:43:31.738 --> 00:43:32.598]  Concentrated peppermint.
[00:43:33.118 --> 00:43:42.245]  Mouthwash 10 to 1, pure unscented body wash, pure tea tree shampoo, long-lasting natural deodorant.
[00:43:42.245 --> 00:43:44.546]  50% off Emmerich's Essentials product for a limited time.
[00:43:44.546 --> 00:43:50.190]  Delivers you 25% off the retail price, plus an additional 25% off when you're signing up for auto ship.
[00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:55.594]  And this is selling great, but I want fence sitters who are waiting for a deal to do it.
[00:43:55.594 --> 00:43:56.115]  I mean, folks.
[00:43:57.483 --> 00:43:59.726]  It sells for $15 in Whole Foods.
[00:43:59.726 --> 00:44:02.229]  It's Nature's Brand, one of the top ones in the country.
[00:44:02.229 --> 00:44:07.134]  You heard the Patriot CEO on this week.
[00:44:07.134 --> 00:44:10.358]  And then we normally sell it, put it on the bottle, $10, $8, or $12, put it on the product.
[00:44:10.358 --> 00:44:11.379]  When we do 50% off, I mean, it really is.
[00:44:16.169 --> 00:44:20.474]  I don't know, this stuff costs us like $3, $4 a bottle depending on what the product is.
[00:44:20.474 --> 00:44:22.236]  I'm making like $1 or $2 on these.
[00:44:22.236 --> 00:44:26.261]  But I want you to become a customer if you haven't done it.
[00:44:26.261 --> 00:44:32.087]  You can get the same stuff sold on NCAPS and Whole Foods, Nature's Brand, as Emirates Essentials.
[00:44:32.087 --> 00:44:33.369]  This is a big deal.
[00:44:33.369 --> 00:44:35.551]  This is a top high quality certified organic.
[00:44:36.736 --> 00:44:39.557]  These things only have a few ingredients per bottle, not 30, 40, 50.
[00:44:39.557 --> 00:44:40.217]  No chemicals.
[00:44:40.217 --> 00:44:42.698]  It's so good for your children, so good for yourself.
[00:44:42.698 --> 00:44:45.019]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:44:45.019 --> 00:44:45.979]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:44:45.979 --> 00:44:51.682]  Okay, I'm going to stop plugging now, but it's your purchases that make it all possible.
[00:44:51.682 --> 00:44:54.263]  Oh, I just want to mention this.
[00:44:54.263 --> 00:44:55.103]  This is a flash sale.
[00:44:56.423 --> 00:44:58.084]  Tim wanted to do this even though we're about to sell out.
[00:44:58.084 --> 00:44:59.885]  We get more in in about three weeks.
[00:44:59.885 --> 00:45:01.746]  So we want to sell out before more comes in.
[00:45:01.746 --> 00:45:06.848]  50% off retail on Caveman strawberry and chocolate formula.
[00:45:06.848 --> 00:45:12.391]  You talk about meal replacement, you talk about energy, you talk about bones, you talk about stamina, you talk about trace elements, you talk about true
[00:45:13.752 --> 00:45:16.215]  Minerals in their ring structure form.
[00:45:16.215 --> 00:45:17.856]  I've been told why it's so important.
[00:45:17.856 --> 00:45:20.879]  Talk about superfood with chaga mushroom, turmeric, bee pollen, more.
[00:45:20.879 --> 00:45:22.020]  Totally organic.
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.543]  Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula.
[00:45:24.543 --> 00:45:28.086]  Infowarslife.com 50% off.
[00:45:28.086 --> 00:45:30.048]  I forgot I agreed to do this yesterday.
[00:45:30.048 --> 00:45:31.390]  So be sure and take it.
[00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:34.133]  But we're only doing it till it obviously sells out.
[00:45:34.693 --> 00:45:42.795]  We've never done that because I just absolutely want to give people the absolute best deals that have been on the fence.
[00:45:42.795 --> 00:45:46.556]  Similar bone broth formulas that aren't even as strong are $60 to $70.
[00:45:46.556 --> 00:45:48.996]  This is way below half that at infowarrestore.com.
[00:45:48.996 --> 00:45:52.777]  Okay, I'm going to stop right now.
[00:45:52.777 --> 00:45:57.118]  I don't take pleasure in how ignorant these people are, but they're dangerous.
[00:46:00.592 --> 00:46:09.138]  Here is Paul's video that I'm going to play, the even crazier one, where the leftists are blaming Trump for Antifa, saying they work for him.
[00:46:09.138 --> 00:46:12.640]  You see, the moment the left then says the Antifa's bad, oh, now they work for Trump.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:21.527]  See, everything's insane asylum, where you just, like the Tea Party that they're having in Alice in Wonderland, you just make up whatever you want, like you're on 14 hits of acid.
[00:46:22.307 --> 00:46:23.588]  But that's how they all are.
[00:46:23.588 --> 00:46:26.811]  Almost all students at UT are the stupidest people.
[00:46:26.811 --> 00:46:29.013]  I could walk into some auto parts store and talk to guys.
[00:46:29.013 --> 00:46:36.080]  They'd be super on target, streetwise, know what's going on, because they got a family, they got kids, they got a paycheck, they got to make, they're jumping through hoops.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:41.605]  But you talk to these zombies and their arrested development at the colleges, it is a joke.
[00:46:41.605 --> 00:46:46.850]  Now let's go ahead and go to Paul's video, the dumbest anti-Trump protesters ever.
[00:46:49.445 --> 00:46:58.289]  So now that the left is finally being forced to disavow Antifa, the anti-Trump movement can return to its credible, rational, intelligent roots, right?
[00:46:58.289 --> 00:47:02.071]  Do you always make fart noises with your mouth?
[00:47:02.071 --> 00:47:02.472]  Wrong.
[00:47:02.472 --> 00:47:04.893]  Go away with your f***ing face!
[00:47:04.893 --> 00:47:10.335]  What kind of job could this woman have, given that she's so adept at reasoned forthright debate?
[00:47:10.335 --> 00:47:11.136]  I wonder.
[00:47:11.136 --> 00:47:13.077]  I'm a f***ing professor at the University of Texas.
[00:47:13.077 --> 00:47:14.458]  Yeah, she's teaching your kids.
[00:47:14.458 --> 00:47:15.458]  You wanna know what I teach?
[00:47:15.458 --> 00:47:16.519]  Political science.
[00:47:16.519 --> 00:47:18.500]  No, I don't teach political science, you asshat.
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:19.020]  What do you teach?
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.661]  Why do you think I stand here?
[00:47:21.661 --> 00:47:22.581]  I don't know, what do you teach?
[00:47:22.581 --> 00:47:24.722]  What do you think she teaches?
[00:47:24.722 --> 00:47:26.902]  Take a wild guess!
[00:47:26.902 --> 00:47:28.043]  And it's gender studies.
[00:47:28.043 --> 00:47:29.643]  Well, imagine my shock!
[00:47:29.643 --> 00:47:34.364]  But being a professor, at least she must understand the value of free speech, right?
[00:47:34.364 --> 00:47:34.684]  ...statement.
[00:47:34.684 --> 00:47:36.605]  Yeah, hide the camera from your embarrassment.
[00:47:36.605 --> 00:47:37.445]  You know what?
[00:47:37.445 --> 00:47:39.566]  This is why higher education is failing.
[00:47:39.566 --> 00:47:42.687]  Excuse me, officer, can you please keep this ma- Can you please keep her off my camera?
[00:47:42.687 --> 00:47:42.907]  Wrong.
[00:47:43.715 --> 00:47:46.819]  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[00:47:46.819 --> 00:47:48.821]  People, he wanna have Ben Carson on his team.
[00:47:48.821 --> 00:47:50.103]  Deal with that.
[00:47:50.103 --> 00:47:51.244]  He's not a black person.
[00:47:51.244 --> 00:47:53.847]  Ben Carson is not a black person.
[00:47:53.847 --> 00:47:55.149]  He's not a black person.
[00:47:55.149 --> 00:47:56.290]  He's not a black person.
[00:47:59.318 --> 00:48:00.339]  Wow!
[00:48:00.339 --> 00:48:01.600]  He is a dimwit!
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:06.546]  That's odd because on Wikipedia it says that he's actually a Yale graduate and a brain surgeon!
[00:48:06.546 --> 00:48:11.331]  He's a neurosurgeon but he's um... He's... He's... He's um... He's...
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.481]  He's as dumb as a box of rocks!
[00:48:21.481 --> 00:48:22.361]  Yeah, alright.
[00:48:22.361 --> 00:48:23.182]  But you, though.
[00:48:23.182 --> 00:48:24.382]  How about you?
[00:48:24.382 --> 00:48:24.942]  What about me?
[00:48:24.942 --> 00:48:26.563]  What are you good at?
[00:48:26.563 --> 00:48:34.506]  Well, I... She's good at calling herself an anti-racist while simultaneously disparaging educated, successful black people.
[00:48:34.506 --> 00:48:35.727]  What do we do that's hate-mongering?
[00:48:35.727 --> 00:48:36.747]  You're a smarmy little prick.
[00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:38.968]  Get the f*** out of my city, you prick, you.
[00:48:38.968 --> 00:48:39.988]  You gotta spread love, y'all.
[00:48:39.988 --> 00:48:41.489]  Are you spreading love?
[00:48:41.489 --> 00:48:43.010]  What you're doing is incredibly hateful.
[00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:44.470]  Are you spreading love?
[00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:45.611]  Get the f*** out of my city.
[00:48:45.611 --> 00:48:46.411]  Are you spreading love?
[00:48:49.494 --> 00:48:51.998]  Why do you want Trump impeached?
[00:48:51.998 --> 00:48:57.268]  They're meanwhile dividing people over Trump.
[00:48:57.268 --> 00:48:59.513]  She's a total mental illness back that up 30 seconds, please.
[00:49:04.639 --> 00:49:12.425]  They're saying, F you, we're going to get you, get out of here, you have no right to be here while cussing at him and spitting in his face and stuff.
[00:49:12.425 --> 00:49:16.287]  And then when they do it, they say, oh, see, you're spreading the love.
[00:49:16.287 --> 00:49:23.332]  This is the Harry Potter universe where these people just make stuff up as they go along.
[00:49:23.332 --> 00:49:26.074]  They're attacking him.
[00:49:26.074 --> 00:49:28.756]  They're the fascist.
[00:49:28.756 --> 00:49:31.498]  But they would call themselves the anti-fascist.
[00:49:31.498 --> 00:49:33.380]  He's out there really to get their views.
[00:49:34.755 --> 00:49:39.057]  But could find no one that would talk, other than screaming hate.
[00:49:39.057 --> 00:49:43.158]  Millie found one guy that would talk, and they ended up being friends, when she went out.
[00:49:43.158 --> 00:49:44.559]  We really want to hear from you.
[00:49:44.559 --> 00:49:46.639]  In fact, we want to interface with you.
[00:49:46.639 --> 00:49:54.882]  But I know the leftist groups that bust you out there and pay for a lot of you to be there, tell you in their literature, don't talk to the opposition, they're Nazis.
[00:49:54.882 --> 00:49:56.703]  That's because they want to keep you in the cult.
[00:49:56.703 --> 00:49:58.564]  What's the number one thing about a cult?
[00:49:59.531 --> 00:50:04.715]  It tells you, don't talk to other people, don't debate, just have slogans.
[00:50:04.715 --> 00:50:05.816]  Let's go back to Paul's piece.
[00:50:26.273 --> 00:50:39.742]  Let's be fair, at least when they were asked a specific question, why they thought Trump should be impeached, the answers were clear and cogent.
[00:50:39.742 --> 00:50:44.845]  Do you believe Trump should be impeached?
[00:50:44.845 --> 00:50:45.866]  That's a UT professor.
[00:50:47.443 --> 00:50:51.310]  Do you make fart noises with your mouth?
[00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:55.216]  I'm asking people why they want Trump in peace and nobody can answer the question.
[00:50:55.216 --> 00:50:57.801]  Can you stop blowing at me?
[00:50:57.801 --> 00:51:00.285]  Where did you go to college?
[00:51:00.285 --> 00:51:01.367]  Where did you get your education?
[00:51:06.843 --> 00:51:09.005]  Why do you want Trump impeached?
[00:51:09.005 --> 00:51:10.146]  I don't know, man.
[00:51:10.146 --> 00:51:11.267]  Why do you think?
[00:51:11.267 --> 00:51:12.668]  You're so dumb.
[00:51:12.668 --> 00:51:14.149]  You are really dumb.
[00:51:14.149 --> 00:51:14.750]  For real.
[00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:19.333]  All the signs say impeach Trump and I'm trying to figure out why.
[00:51:19.333 --> 00:51:20.714]  Now that's still not an argument.
[00:51:20.714 --> 00:51:21.955]  So why should Trump be impeached?
[00:51:21.955 --> 00:51:24.377]  Because he's lied a thousand times on record.
[00:51:24.377 --> 00:51:25.959]  What does he lie about?
[00:51:25.959 --> 00:51:26.419]  He's a liar.
[00:51:26.419 --> 00:51:28.020]  I know, so it keeps coming back.
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:28.901]  So what does he lie about?
[00:51:38.476 --> 00:51:40.797]  Paul and Owen teaming up is incredible.
[00:51:40.797 --> 00:51:42.978]  But you're out here protesting, you shouldn't have to look it up.
[00:51:42.978 --> 00:51:45.199]  You know, you should already know your cause, don't you think?
[00:51:45.199 --> 00:51:46.840]  You're probably, you know, right?
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.461]  You're probably, you know, right?
[00:51:48.461 --> 00:51:52.343]  I mean if you have to look it up, it must not be that important to you, you know?
[00:51:59.454 --> 00:52:00.535]  Do you support America, sir?
[00:52:00.535 --> 00:52:01.536]  I support America all the way.
[00:52:01.536 --> 00:52:02.377]  Freedom of speech.
[00:52:02.377 --> 00:52:04.558]  Yeah, you love freedom of speech so much.
[00:52:04.558 --> 00:52:09.603]  You love it so much, you're physically trying to block someone else's freedom of speech.
[00:52:09.603 --> 00:52:12.745]  Do you have kids?
[00:52:12.745 --> 00:52:18.750]  Do you have a family?
[00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:22.093]  Hey, can you tell me why Trump should be impeached, ma'am?
[00:52:22.093 --> 00:52:23.654]  Go away.
[00:52:23.654 --> 00:52:25.316]  It's still over.
[00:52:25.316 --> 00:52:26.617]  Hey, why should Trump be impeached?
[00:52:30.353 --> 00:52:30.756]  No.
[00:52:30.756 --> 00:52:32.569]  So you are out here supporting President Trump?
[00:52:33.331 --> 00:52:33.891]  Yep.
[00:52:33.891 --> 00:52:35.211]  America First policy.
[00:52:35.211 --> 00:52:35.852]  Exactly.
[00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:36.392]  Thank you.
[00:52:36.392 --> 00:52:37.052]  Thank you.
[00:52:37.052 --> 00:52:37.372]  Yeah.
[00:52:37.372 --> 00:52:38.192]  What's this?
[00:52:38.192 --> 00:52:41.113]  Using intimidation to shut down people of color?
[00:52:41.113 --> 00:52:43.013]  To come out here with all these crazy protesters.
[00:52:43.013 --> 00:52:44.054]  Hey, watch out!
[00:52:44.054 --> 00:52:45.034]  Yeah, do me a favor.
[00:52:45.034 --> 00:52:46.054]  Check that white privilege.
[00:52:46.054 --> 00:52:47.094]  So let me get this straight.
[00:52:47.094 --> 00:52:49.035]  What's left of the anti-Trump movement?
[00:52:49.035 --> 00:52:52.976]  The same movement that has hysterical tantrums about Trump and his supporters?
[00:52:52.976 --> 00:52:56.156]  Being hateful, trampling on rights, and silencing minorities?
[00:52:56.156 --> 00:52:59.737]  Here's a hateful mob that tramples on people's rights and silences minorities.
[00:52:59.737 --> 00:53:02.878]  And they blame Antifa for discrediting the left.
[00:53:03.018 --> 00:53:11.741]  Yeah, forget about Antifa, you're doing a pretty damn fine job of discrediting yourselves.
[00:53:11.741 --> 00:53:17.943]  Antifa is just the latest droppings of the mainline left.
[00:53:17.943 --> 00:53:29.006]  Dirty, stupid, mentally ill, confused, ignorant, hateful, violent, arrogant, entitled,
[00:53:32.256 --> 00:53:33.317]  No logic.
[00:53:33.317 --> 00:53:36.280]  Like, Spock is a 10 on the logic scale.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.343]  The leftists are a zero.
[00:53:39.343 --> 00:53:42.366]  There's just no logic with these people.
[00:53:42.366 --> 00:53:47.612]  Now, let's get to an even sicker video.
[00:53:47.612 --> 00:53:48.092]  Sad.
[00:53:48.092 --> 00:53:50.815]  Liberal student thinks Trump stands with Antifa.
[00:53:50.815 --> 00:53:52.357]  And this is just a snapshot.
[00:53:53.919 --> 00:53:59.370]  That Jake Lloyd, one of our newest and awesome reporters, everybody here is awesome, but what a great new crew member.
[00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:02.055]  Everybody doing such a great job and putting up with me.
[00:54:02.055 --> 00:54:05.141]  Let's go ahead and go to, this is UT yesterday.
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:13.083]  See, our problem is Owen got back with two hours of footage and uploaded it, and it was in 20 minute chunks.
[00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:19.985]  And this one got 300,000, this one got 200,000, this one got 100,000, this one got 300,000, this one got 90,000 or so.
[00:54:19.985 --> 00:54:22.886]  And I'm like, I understand you work till 10 at night, and you're awesome, Owen.
[00:54:22.886 --> 00:54:27.228]  We're going to get you an assistant who will then grow and become as successful as you, hopefully.
[00:54:28.837 --> 00:54:31.758]  I got folks that are lead producers now that were interns here two years ago.
[00:54:31.758 --> 00:54:33.079]  I'm just looking for talent.
[00:54:33.079 --> 00:54:33.719]  You can be a woman.
[00:54:33.719 --> 00:54:34.619]  You can be Hispanic.
[00:54:34.619 --> 00:54:35.280]  You can be black.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:35.920]  You can be white.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.000]  You can be Russian.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.561]  You can be Chinese.
[00:54:38.561 --> 00:54:39.521]  You want to fight tyranny?
[00:54:39.521 --> 00:54:41.042]  You want to work?
[00:54:41.042 --> 00:54:41.742]  Baby, I love you.
[00:54:41.742 --> 00:54:43.323]  But the point is, is that
[00:54:44.676 --> 00:54:50.838]  I said, I guarantee you, if you'd have edited just one of these down, it would get 10 million views, and then we'd reach more people.
[00:54:50.838 --> 00:54:53.879]  They're like, no, you're right, Alex, but we just have to upload it raw.
[00:54:53.879 --> 00:54:55.080]  I said, it doesn't matter.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:55:00.602]  Somebody else will grab that, edit it, and put it out awesome on their channel, and I want that to happen.
[00:55:00.602 --> 00:55:02.043]  And it was Paul Watson!
[00:55:02.043 --> 00:55:04.543]  No communication with Paul, it just happened.
[00:55:04.543 --> 00:55:07.625]  Because they were asking, I go, what should the headlines be, boss?
[00:55:07.625 --> 00:55:09.765]  And I said, well, you're as good as I am, Owen.
[00:55:09.765 --> 00:55:13.827]  But I said, let's go with Dumbest Liberal Protesters Ever.
[00:55:16.052 --> 00:55:20.276]  Paul Watson without even the same headline or a little bit different.
[00:55:20.276 --> 00:55:22.918]  He said Trump protester.
[00:55:22.918 --> 00:55:23.839]  I've already gone too far.
[00:55:23.839 --> 00:55:26.441]  I've got to come back and air this piece with...
[00:55:28.277 --> 00:55:32.819]  Liberal student thinks Trump stands with Antifa and just the death of the logic.
[00:55:32.819 --> 00:55:48.064]  You gotta understand, we didn't go find some poor brain damage electroshock therapy victim from the 70s, you know, like a third of the schizophrenics are that were dumped out of the state hospital in the 90s that like troll around Austin, Texas that I genuinely give money to and try to help out.
[00:55:48.064 --> 00:55:49.765]  I don't give money to the crackheads or the drunks.
[00:55:49.765 --> 00:55:54.866]  I don't know, sometimes when they're honest and you got a sign begging for a six-pack, I'll give them ten bucks.
[00:55:54.866 --> 00:55:56.387]  But the point is, is that
[00:55:58.536 --> 00:56:04.678]  I do try to help out the schizophrenics, but we're not out there trolling for schizophrenics.
[00:56:04.678 --> 00:56:20.285]  By all my lucky stars, if you go down to UT, in fact, I want to do this the next week or two, and you just sit there for three hours, I will be attacked, I will be spit on, I will be cussed at, I will be called a Nazi.
[00:56:20.285 --> 00:56:24.786]  I would guess, if I'm out there three hours, I'd say 200 times.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:30.102]  And then I'll have some fans come over as well that are going to be totally well-spoken.
[00:56:30.102 --> 00:56:42.910]  In fact, I want to do a live feed sometime, unannounced, unscripted, at UT, with a camera, live streaming on Facebook Mentions, and I'm going to illustrate this to everybody.
[00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:47.712]  Then we're going to go back to this date, September 1st, and play this clip from the vault.
[00:56:49.477 --> 00:56:50.918]  Of my prediction coming true.
[00:56:50.918 --> 00:56:53.001]  That none of them will be able to talk.
[00:56:53.001 --> 00:56:54.782]  None of them will be able to say anything.
[00:56:54.782 --> 00:56:57.785]  Some will try to get physical.
[00:56:57.785 --> 00:56:59.547]  And that none of them will be intellectual.
[00:56:59.547 --> 00:57:05.052]  But then every person that's a listener will be incredibly intellectual and incredibly informed.
[00:57:05.052 --> 00:57:06.213]  And they're going to be black.
[00:57:06.213 --> 00:57:07.174]  They're going to be white.
[00:57:07.174 --> 00:57:08.275]  They're going to be Hispanic.
[00:57:08.275 --> 00:57:09.336]  They're going to be Asian.
[00:57:09.336 --> 00:57:12.620]  We will have a diverse group of people that will all be well-spoken.
[00:57:14.013 --> 00:57:20.603]  And then all of their supporters, the state, the globalist supporters, will be drooling nincompoops.
[00:57:21.994 --> 00:57:23.674]  And again, why do I illustrate this?
[00:57:23.674 --> 00:57:35.016]  Because if we show people who liberals are, and if we show them who Antifa is, and if we show them who the zombies are at these colleges, we will be able to wake up the world.
[00:57:35.016 --> 00:57:37.517]  Now, I'm not even going to do an intro next segment.
[00:57:37.517 --> 00:57:40.477]  Some stations don't carry it, but I'm going to come in and play it.
[00:57:40.477 --> 00:57:42.558]  And the full video is on InfoWars.com.
[00:57:42.558 --> 00:57:44.578]  I'm going to come right in with this piece.
[00:57:44.578 --> 00:57:47.298]  Let me come back in a few minutes.
[00:57:47.298 --> 00:57:49.999]  Sad, liberal student thinks Trump stands with Antifa.
[00:57:51.459 --> 00:57:53.020]  And then we've got James Leslie Rawls.
[00:57:53.020 --> 00:58:00.264]  He predicted the summer of rage a year ago that they would try, if Trump got elected, to overthrow him with communist groups.
[00:58:00.264 --> 00:58:02.225]  He's predicted it in triplicate.
[00:58:02.225 --> 00:58:04.547]  He's been really predicting the last six months.
[00:58:04.547 --> 00:58:06.468]  He'll be joining us.
[00:58:06.468 --> 00:58:14.953]  Austin Fletcher, Jack Posobiec, Arthur Schopper, Mike Cernovich, and more today.
[00:58:16.604 --> 00:58:20.906]  So you'll definitely want to stay with us, and I intend to get some phones open as well.
[00:58:20.906 --> 00:58:25.869]  The House is to vote on self-driving car legislation to force the robot takeover.
[00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:27.890]  That's all coming up as well.
[00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:32.272]  So much to cover as the SPLC calls for our U.S.
[00:58:32.272 --> 00:58:36.154]  military bases to be closed because they're named after Confederate generals.
[00:58:36.154 --> 00:58:39.316]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:58:39.316 --> 00:58:40.657]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:40.657 --> 00:58:43.998]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.897 --> 00:58:54.620]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:59:05.245]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had
[00:59:05.385 --> 00:59:07.667]  Much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:59:07.667 --> 00:59:14.312]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:59:14.312 --> 00:59:16.874]  And so I set out to develop Caveman.
[00:59:16.874 --> 00:59:23.500]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:24.681]  We're good to go.
[00:59:52.276 --> 01:00:06.341]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:06.341 --> 01:00:09.122]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:00:09.122 --> 01:00:11.983]  It's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:14.423]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.423 --> 01:00:19.325]  So are you familiar with the events that went down in Charlottesville, Virginia?
[01:00:19.881 --> 01:00:20.882]  Yes.
[01:00:20.882 --> 01:00:24.784]  And what's a brief summary of what happened there as far as you know?
[01:00:24.784 --> 01:00:33.388]  Well, what I know was apparently some people founded upon themselves to get together and kind of just protest against race.
[01:00:33.388 --> 01:00:35.489]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:00:35.489 --> 01:00:36.750]  Come on, try getting it out.
[01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:40.272]  Well, I think I think of the words.
[01:00:40.272 --> 01:00:41.012]  Try getting it out.
[01:00:41.823 --> 01:00:42.163]  That's fine.
[01:00:42.163 --> 01:00:48.305]  So basically there was an event, um, that was, there were some white nationalists and stuff there.
[01:00:48.305 --> 01:00:53.947]  And then of course, you know, that type of event will attract like Klansmen and Nazis and stuff.
[01:00:53.947 --> 01:00:58.649]  Um, they were just protesting out there and there was another group that came out to protest them.
[01:00:58.649 --> 01:01:00.509]  Uh, there was a radical communist group called Antifa.
[01:01:00.509 --> 01:01:01.370]  Are you very familiar with them?
[01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:04.170]  Uh, a little bit, a little bit.
[01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:05.431]  Uh, what do you know about them?
[01:01:05.431 --> 01:01:05.671]  Anything?
[01:01:06.724 --> 01:01:15.529]  Um, not very, not so much, but just that they're, uh, kinda under the same guidelines as, like, the Evangelicalists and, like, the KKK and stuff like that, you know?
[01:01:15.529 --> 01:01:18.830]  They're just really white power and stuff like that.
[01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:20.171]  Antifa's white power?
[01:01:20.171 --> 01:01:21.032]  Okay, so, um...
[01:01:22.232 --> 01:01:28.678]  Now, after this last event that happened this weekend, there was a Patriot Prayer event.
[01:01:28.678 --> 01:01:31.059]  That's the organization that held the event.
[01:01:31.059 --> 01:01:34.182]  And Antifa came out and they decided to crash this event.
[01:01:34.182 --> 01:01:36.424]  You know, there were a lot of speakers of a lot of different colors.
[01:01:36.424 --> 01:01:38.566]  There was even a trans speaker up there.
[01:01:38.566 --> 01:01:43.690]  And they decided to come out and do violence and destroy property and beat people with clubs and pour urine on people.
[01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:48.994]  First of all, do you think that's an appropriate way for Americans to do political discourse?
[01:01:48.994 --> 01:01:50.295]  No, not at all.
[01:01:50.295 --> 01:01:53.418]  I think here in America, people should be able to be who they are.
[01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:55.900]  That's kind of what the land of the free is supposed to be and all.
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:59.263]  You should be able to have your own religion, own race, but we're all the same.
[01:01:59.263 --> 01:02:01.325]  You're a white male!
[01:02:02.866 --> 01:02:09.809]  And how do you feel about President Trump's comments on Charlottesville that said both sides were violent, both sides should be condemned?
[01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:10.590]  I think it was awful.
[01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:17.333]  I think he, there's an obvious side that was wrong and an obvious side that was doing... Like clearly Antifa and all the other groups were wrong, right?
[01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:17.913]  Yes, of course.
[01:02:18.613 --> 01:02:21.954]  Yeah, we can't tolerate that kind of racism in America.
[01:02:21.954 --> 01:02:33.799]  Now, a lot of congressmen and women like Nancy Pelosi, a lot of the mainstream media have come out and denounced this group, Antifa, because they were the ones doing the violence in California this weekend.
[01:02:33.799 --> 01:02:39.481]  Do you think that we need to have more politicians and media personalities come out and denounce them?
[01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:40.001]  Yes, of course.
[01:02:40.001 --> 01:02:45.683]  I think the more that come out and denounce them, the better this problem could be solved and stuff like that.
[01:02:46.323 --> 01:02:48.904]  What do you think Donald Trump should say about Antifa?
[01:02:48.904 --> 01:02:54.405]  Do you think that his silence on the matter speaks to whose side he's really on?
[01:02:54.405 --> 01:03:00.046]  Yes, his silence definitely speaks to the side that he's on.
[01:03:00.046 --> 01:03:08.207]  I think he should definitely come out with a speech or address the country and just explain that this isn't acceptable.
[01:03:08.207 --> 01:03:09.868]  Be the president he's supposed to be.
[01:03:09.868 --> 01:03:15.669]  Do you think he should call out Antifa by name and declare them a domestic terrorist organization if they're going to come out and do this kind of violence?
[01:03:16.601 --> 01:03:27.685]  Personally, I think so, but, you know, there's a lot of controversy and stuff like that, so I assume that he probably wouldn't, but... They've got gloves and they've got everything.
[01:03:27.685 --> 01:03:29.225]  Antifa!
[01:03:29.225 --> 01:03:29.905]  Right, absolutely.
[01:03:29.905 --> 01:03:38.628]  I mean, we cannot, like I said a minute ago, we cannot tolerate white supremacists like Antifa and the KKK to keep destroying American property and stuff.
[01:03:38.628 --> 01:03:44.090]  Is there anything else you want to say on the state of political violence in America or Donald Trump or any of these things?
[01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:47.852]  I did not vote for him.
[01:03:47.852 --> 01:03:49.493]  Who did you vote for?
[01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:50.413]  Clinton.
[01:03:50.413 --> 01:03:50.654]  Clinton?
[01:03:50.654 --> 01:03:53.656]  What did you like about Clinton over Trump?
[01:03:53.656 --> 01:03:57.438]  She had political experience and stuff like that.
[01:03:57.438 --> 01:04:00.760]  She was in the mix of everything for quite a while.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.701]  She knew the secrets.
[01:04:01.701 --> 01:04:04.643]  She knew how to run a government and stuff like that.
[01:04:04.643 --> 01:04:07.785]  I mean, yeah, there was still the scandalous stuff about her.
[01:04:07.785 --> 01:04:10.266]  What difference at this point does it make?
[01:04:11.207 --> 01:04:14.409]  She never acted like a child, like Donald Trump and stuff like that.
[01:04:14.409 --> 01:04:16.090]  Right, she had real political experience.
[01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:19.253]  I mean, if you look at how she handled the Benghazi situation, she did wonderfully.
[01:04:19.253 --> 01:04:20.273]  You know, stuff like that.
[01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:21.034]  Would you agree?
[01:04:21.034 --> 01:04:24.476]  Yes.
[01:04:24.476 --> 01:04:30.760]  Yeah, Benghazi really proved exactly how good she could be and how qualified she was for the position.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.382]  But anyways, is there anything else you'd like to say in closing?
[01:04:33.382 --> 01:04:33.783]  No, thank you.
[01:04:33.783 --> 01:04:35.063]  Alright, well thank you very much.
[01:04:35.063 --> 01:04:35.624]  I appreciate it.
[01:04:36.388 --> 01:04:42.713]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[01:05:00.905 --> 01:05:07.728]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[01:05:07.728 --> 01:05:10.268]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[01:05:10.268 --> 01:05:13.730]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:15.931]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[01:05:15.931 --> 01:05:20.752]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[01:05:20.752 --> 01:05:23.633]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[01:05:23.633 --> 01:05:27.875]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[01:05:31.016 --> 01:05:31.656]  Precedented.
[01:05:31.656 --> 01:05:32.877]  And it's cold-pressed.
[01:05:32.877 --> 01:05:34.797]  That's why Super Mayo is so different.
[01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:43.200]  People say, well, I know these compounds work, because it's admitted in science, and these are other, what you sell, they, BuzzFeed said, it's like, there's already best-selling stuff that's been certified as, you know, healthy and good forever.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.420]  Why these aren't anything new?
[01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:48.461]  Because, why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[01:05:48.461 --> 01:05:48.681]  Duh.
[01:05:48.681 --> 01:05:49.061]  Duh.
[01:05:57.708 --> 01:06:01.470]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:09.213]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:06:09.213 --> 01:06:17.797]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:06:17.797 --> 01:06:21.859]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:06:22.239 --> 01:06:32.062]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:06:32.062 --> 01:06:35.483]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:06:35.483 --> 01:06:46.527]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:06:46.707 --> 01:06:49.513]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[01:06:49.513 --> 01:06:52.620]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:55.506]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:06:56.263 --> 01:06:58.124]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:06:58.124 --> 01:07:00.165]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:07:00.165 --> 01:07:03.067]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:07:03.067 --> 01:07:09.131]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:07:09.131 --> 01:07:18.336]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:07:18.336 --> 01:07:23.179]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[01:07:23.399 --> 01:07:25.843]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:07:25.843 --> 01:07:33.894]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:07:33.894 --> 01:07:34.856]  The general public doesn't.
[01:07:36.051 --> 01:07:39.992]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:07:39.992 --> 01:07:43.573]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:07:43.573 --> 01:07:50.275]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:54.456]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:04.905]  50,000 unstoppable lots!
[01:08:04.905 --> 01:08:07.208]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:09.731]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:08:09.731 --> 01:08:12.435]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:12.435 --> 01:08:15.279]  Anthrax!
[01:08:15.279 --> 01:08:16.000]  And radio!
[01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.407]  That's Clutch bringing us in with 50,000 watts.
[01:08:32.407 --> 01:08:48.313]  That's a song about Fort Detrick, Maryland, where they got 50,000 watt shortwave transmitters and Anthrax bombs.
[01:08:48.313 --> 01:08:50.594]  That's right, Anthrax and radio!
[01:08:57.352 --> 01:09:00.773]  James Leslie Rawls was scheduled, but he got stuck traveling.
[01:09:00.773 --> 01:09:05.575]  Boy, you know that happens with all this flooding and the rest of it, so he'll be on next week.
[01:09:05.575 --> 01:09:18.561]  We do have a bunch of guests coming up in the next hour, but I was already talking about opening the phones up more today, and so we're going to do that in this hour on Hurricane Harvey, the new hurricane, Irma, that could be threatening the Gulf.
[01:09:19.557 --> 01:09:23.259]  Trump giving a million dollars and being criticized for it.
[01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:34.247]  Driverless cars as the House of Representatives moves to basically turn the roads over to the corporations and their robot sentries that will of course be above the law.
[01:09:34.247 --> 01:09:35.707]  And that ties into Google.
[01:09:35.707 --> 01:09:38.669]  Big story up on newswars.com.
[01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:39.930]  Newswars.com.
[01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:45.214]  A lot of exclusive important content there that it's up to you to get out, please.
[01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:48.556]  Insider Google greatest threat to conservatism.
[01:09:49.471 --> 01:10:03.122]  And now it's coming out that they even manipulated Forbes to remove articles critical of Google and their monopolistic antitrust needed-to-be-blocked behavior.
[01:10:03.122 --> 01:10:10.988]  So former Think Tank program director and antitrust expert suggests that he was fired after criticizing Google, warning the rise of the monopolistic
[01:10:12.662 --> 01:10:23.125]  Companies like Google are a threat to society, a fear validated after the company recently warned a conservative website to censor content or lose ad revenue.
[01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:26.486]  And just a few months ago we got the internal documents that Google admitted were real.
[01:10:26.486 --> 01:10:35.449]  They were paying millions of dollars to have outside groups go and vote down our news and claim it's fake, hateful or racist.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.162]  So they can say, oh, the community did it, we didn't do it.
[01:10:39.162 --> 01:10:50.890]  It's like hiring a hitman to go kill somebody, but you say, oh, but I didn't pull the trigger, or I didn't wrap the tourniquet around their neck.
[01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:55.734]  No, I just sent somebody to do it.
[01:10:55.734 --> 01:10:57.015]  I never killed anybody.
[01:10:57.015 --> 01:10:59.516]  No, you never killed anybody in your life.
[01:10:59.516 --> 01:11:01.418]  You sent somebody else to do it, didn't you?
[01:11:02.355 --> 01:11:25.551]  And Google, Facebook, Twitter, they're all working in collusion, admittedly, to launch the censorship of nationalists, of patriots, of conservatives, of Christians, and they're teaming up with governments in the Middle East to report people that talk bad about their imam so they can be executed.
[01:11:25.551 --> 01:11:25.991]  That's right.
[01:11:27.298 --> 01:11:45.715]  That's in the news every day how Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others in Iran, and in Pakistan, and in Saudi Arabia, every day it's in my stack where Google, Facebook, Twitter, they don't even need to get a complaint!
[01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:50.984]  From the religious police in Saudi Arabia or Iran.
[01:11:50.984 --> 01:11:53.845]  They will report it to them and liaison with them.
[01:11:53.845 --> 01:12:03.072]  So, see, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the rest of them, they tailor the censorship to the countries and the parties in power.
[01:12:03.072 --> 01:12:13.779]  Just like Hillary was in thousands and thousands of WikiLeaks with Podesta and her other crew members managing the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, but more importantly, Google.
[01:12:14.873 --> 01:12:19.175]  In daily meetings and getting daily files from the Hillary campaign.
[01:12:19.175 --> 01:12:26.298]  She even had interns running whole sections of the internet blocking this, upvoting that.
[01:12:26.298 --> 01:12:31.861]  They've hired the former Stasi to help run Facebook Germany.
[01:12:31.861 --> 01:12:35.803]  To then dispatch the police.
[01:12:35.803 --> 01:12:40.104]  Sweden, man sentenced for eating bacon in front of Muslims.
[01:12:40.104 --> 01:12:40.905]  That's in the official
[01:12:42.304 --> 01:12:45.446]  Major newspapers of Stockholm.
[01:12:45.446 --> 01:12:46.426]  It's always Stockholm.
[01:12:46.426 --> 01:12:48.787]  Where they say Muslims are allowed to rape.
[01:12:48.787 --> 01:12:49.588]  It's their culture.
[01:12:49.588 --> 01:12:52.849]  They're allowed to poop in the pool, too.
[01:12:52.849 --> 01:12:57.392]  They also like to, for some reason, defecate beside the toilet.
[01:12:57.392 --> 01:12:59.013]  They're telling, don't tell them not to.
[01:12:59.013 --> 01:13:01.714]  It's their culture.
[01:13:01.714 --> 01:13:03.515]  Also, don't flush the paper.
[01:13:03.515 --> 01:13:04.676]  You don't do that in the third world.
[01:13:04.676 --> 01:13:06.256]  I guess if you have an outhouse.
[01:13:06.256 --> 01:13:07.117]  So they pile it up.
[01:13:08.339 --> 01:13:10.400]  You see that other third-world populations do it.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:15.823]  But here, you know, they put signs on the toilet saying, no, no, tissue goes in the potty.
[01:13:15.823 --> 01:13:18.164]  You don't do that to a Muslim.
[01:13:18.164 --> 01:13:19.065]  They don't need tissue.
[01:13:19.065 --> 01:13:20.205]  They have their hands.
[01:13:20.205 --> 01:13:26.228]  They come out of the bathroom, out of the stall with their hand curled up because they got the poo-poo in it.
[01:13:26.228 --> 01:13:26.769]  It's no big deal.
[01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:31.711]  And if they have diseases they're not tested, that would be racist too.
[01:13:31.711 --> 01:13:36.534]  You just, you have black plague, you have cholera, you know, you have whatever, just come on in, baby.
[01:13:38.206 --> 01:13:40.467]  That matter of tourism is down 80% in France?
[01:13:40.467 --> 01:13:42.848]  It's what the government wants!
[01:13:42.848 --> 01:13:45.829]  And what the government wants, it gets because it wants to destroy things.
[01:13:45.829 --> 01:13:48.809]  It wants the Jacobin Revolution, the overthrow of reality.
[01:13:48.809 --> 01:14:01.614]  53-year-old man from Stockholm, convicted of offensive behavior, being culturally insensitive, for eating bacon in front of the Muslim women.
[01:14:01.614 --> 01:14:02.334]  Well, that's okay.
[01:14:04.090 --> 01:14:06.652]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:14:06.652 --> 01:14:07.152]  800-259-9231.
[01:14:07.152 --> 01:14:25.025]  And so you've got Google and Facebook and Twitter and Apple with its slave factories on top of us, with the Democratic Party in Hollywood raining down their propaganda and bullying the American people.
[01:14:25.025 --> 01:14:29.849]  And below you've got not just the Antifa, not just the alt-left, but the real left.
[01:14:29.849 --> 01:14:31.170]  I challenge anyone
[01:14:33.018 --> 01:14:53.565]  To make a field trip down to a local Democrat event, and you'll hear, death to America, you'll hear, let's kill all the white people, even though it's mainly white people saying it, but don't worry, I've got a stack of news here about black serial killers in different parts of the country, who go out and hunt white people at bus stops and hike and bike trails.
[01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:58.512]  Oh yeah, there's no hunting of the elite that actually engineered all this.
[01:14:58.512 --> 01:15:10.180]  No, no, it's always some other poor person with their bag of groceries at the bus stop shot in the back of the head, or people on the hike and bike trails shot and hunted.
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:16.124]  And then, in the cases it's being praised on social media, folks are saying, yeah, kill the white devils.
[01:15:17.073 --> 01:15:21.154]  But what's funny is there's no mainstream news coverage of any of these reports.
[01:15:21.154 --> 01:15:22.674]  We have some on Infowars.com.
[01:15:22.674 --> 01:15:26.095]  A Don Salazar wrote about a big case of a guy that reportedly killed a bunch of people.
[01:15:26.095 --> 01:15:28.536]  And he said online, I'm going around and hunting white people.
[01:15:28.536 --> 01:15:30.817]  I'm killing them.
[01:15:30.817 --> 01:15:34.337]  And I guess finally, you know, the police investigated it.
[01:15:34.337 --> 01:15:36.858]  It was mere white people getting killed.
[01:15:36.858 --> 01:15:39.399]  And sure enough, they got their man.
[01:15:39.399 --> 01:15:40.019]  It's being reported.
[01:15:41.886 --> 01:15:53.896]  But that's okay, because the SPLC says, since I mentioned it, we can pull that article up if you'd like to see it in amongst the articles about being arrested for eating bacon.
[01:15:53.896 --> 01:16:03.003]  Only in California, Sacramento to pay gang members a cash stipend, that's a monthly payment, if they stop killing people.
[01:16:03.003 --> 01:16:07.446]  Because it worked so well in Afghanistan to pay the group to stop killing each other.
[01:16:07.446 --> 01:16:08.067]  That's not a joke.
[01:16:09.887 --> 01:16:12.850]  Black man who wanted to kill all the white people, close quote.
[01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:15.852]  Accused of killing white people on a killing spree.
[01:16:15.852 --> 01:16:20.917]  Frederick Demond.
[01:16:20.917 --> 01:16:23.359]  You gotta love that middle name, Demond.
[01:16:23.359 --> 01:16:26.962]  Frederick Demond Scott, 22.
[01:16:26.962 --> 01:16:30.045]  Well, you gotta give his parents credit for coming up with an original name.
[01:16:30.045 --> 01:16:33.367]  I like Demond.
[01:16:33.367 --> 01:16:35.029]  Well, it's actually Demond.
[01:16:35.029 --> 01:16:37.271]  Okay, Frederick Demond Scott.
[01:16:38.476 --> 01:16:40.317]  Let's put a French little twist on it.
[01:16:40.317 --> 01:16:41.158]  Sounds kind of cool.
[01:16:41.158 --> 01:16:50.684]  Frederick Demon Scott, 22, suspected of several bike trail murders in South Kansas City, and now they think a whole bunch more.
[01:16:50.684 --> 01:16:54.206]  Well, I mean, Michael Moore does say we need to get rid of all the white people.
[01:16:54.206 --> 01:16:57.188]  We'd be better off without the white people.
[01:16:57.188 --> 01:17:00.430]  Well, Glenn Beck was led by the establishment into oblivion.
[01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:01.470]  I'm not happy about this.
[01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:04.332]  Glenn Beck's media empire implodes with layoffs.
[01:17:04.332 --> 01:17:07.054]  Ex-employee calls him professionally bipolar.
[01:17:08.148 --> 01:17:17.023]  Well, I don't ever listen to what ex-employees say, because that's famously, you know, it's easier to listen to ex-husbands or ex-wives and believe that type of fairytale people classically get.
[01:17:17.023 --> 01:17:18.285]  But I know what Glenn Beck did to me.
[01:17:19.963 --> 01:17:23.344]  He tried to get radio stations that were carrying my show to not carry me.
[01:17:23.344 --> 01:17:32.545]  He had folks grab for my sponsors and behind the scenes he did all sorts of terrible things while he tried to steal our research and then spin it and twist it.
[01:17:32.545 --> 01:17:44.547]  But when he got in too much trouble doing that, he then became the new Benedict Arnold, Judas Iscariot that goes in mea copus to the media and says, I'm a conservative and let me tell you, they're all really bad people and you liberals are really right.
[01:17:44.547 --> 01:17:46.988]  They kind of pat him on the head and rub him on the belly.
[01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:58.166]  I described it back during the election as him as like a little goblin, a little snake, in on his little belly before Hillary and everybody, hoping for subscription.
[01:17:58.166 --> 01:18:06.650]  What he did was destroy his entire operation that was the biggest independent media organization in the United States.
[01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:09.951]  The most successful.
[01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:10.892]  Multimedia platform.
[01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:18.686]  And I would have been glad if he was a patriot to have him, and we are obviously a lot bigger than Glenn Beck now, but it's not about who's biggest.
[01:18:18.686 --> 01:18:23.830]  Matt Drudge, when in total reach of people and able to change the narrative, is number one.
[01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:32.037]  I sleep good at night knowing there's folks more successful than I am, and I'm looking for other people to become more successful than I am, because I don't have a death wish.
[01:18:32.037 --> 01:18:35.540]  I don't like being numero uno enemy of the globalists.
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.361]  I want to beat them.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:43.161]  And I don't want to storm the metaphysical castle of Count Dracul alone.
[01:18:43.161 --> 01:18:59.885]  I'd like to have a large contingent from the surrounding villages with torches in their hands of all shapes, sizes, and skin colors, and together we can culturally storm the castle, dig him out of his nest, and drive a big old fat juicy steak through his heart.
[01:19:02.506 --> 01:19:12.230]  That takes focus, and that takes not being competitive when it comes to intellectual matters, not being territorial, but loving it.
[01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:19.313]  When my talking points become the talking points of the land, and then the talking points of the world.
[01:19:19.313 --> 01:19:21.253]  That's victory.
[01:19:21.253 --> 01:19:29.737]  Not private jets, and wearing different little fancy sweaters every day, and taking yourself real serious, and inviting directors and people in so you could
[01:19:30.834 --> 01:19:37.757]  Candy ass around and I'm not against Glenn Beck that people say he acts like Liberace I mean nothing against Liberace and his his behavior.
[01:19:37.757 --> 01:19:54.063]  I think you know candy assing about it's kind of cute actually But I mean Glenn Beck is a six-foot three prancing fairy Who is a complete fop and an absolute complete sycophant the power structure and it's good to see him crash and burn
[01:19:55.393 --> 01:19:57.994]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[01:19:57.994 --> 01:19:59.054]  Get back to nature.

[01:20:55.262 --> 01:20:57.223]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:20:57.223 --> 01:21:02.546]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:21:02.546 --> 01:21:04.127]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:21:04.127 --> 01:21:12.492]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:24:03.035 --> 01:24:07.999]  Start of the next segment, get into all the serious economic news, the latest on the hurricane and more.
[01:24:07.999 --> 01:24:10.660]  And there's new Mueller fake investigation news.
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:15.924]  But first off, I'm told all over the internet, Make Frog Straight Again is like best-selling apparel.
[01:24:15.924 --> 01:24:18.226]  Folks have sent me this Make Frog Straight Again hat.
[01:24:19.367 --> 01:24:20.968]  I don't mean this to be homophobic.
[01:24:20.968 --> 01:24:22.529]  It's more like just a joke.
[01:24:22.529 --> 01:24:23.870]  But let's get serious.
[01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:32.156]  Mike Cernovich put out a really funny piece when Hillary claimed that Trump was breathing down his neck, down Mr. Clinton's neck.
[01:24:32.156 --> 01:24:33.777]  And so Pepe the Frog showed up.
[01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:37.300]  So I'll narrate this for radio listeners.
[01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:38.561]  Here it is.
[01:24:38.561 --> 01:24:40.402]  This is not okay, I thought.
[01:24:41.866 --> 01:24:46.549]  It was the second presidential debate, and he was looming behind me.
[01:24:46.549 --> 01:24:51.071]  Two days before, the world heard him brag about groping women.
[01:24:51.071 --> 01:24:59.436]  Now we were on a small stage, and no matter where I walked, he followed me closely, staring at me, making faces.
[01:24:59.436 --> 01:25:02.818]  It was incredibly uncomfortable.
[01:25:02.818 --> 01:25:04.980]  He was literally breathing down my neck.
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:07.742]  My skin crawled.
[01:25:07.742 --> 01:25:15.768]  It was one of those moments where you wish you could hit pause and ask everyone watching, well, what would you do?
[01:25:15.768 --> 01:25:23.214]  I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.
[01:25:23.214 --> 01:25:26.417]  I did, however, grip the microphone extra hard.
[01:25:31.281 --> 01:25:32.562]  Absolutely hilarious.
[01:25:32.562 --> 01:25:34.362]  Love the stuff Mike and his team come up with.
[01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:36.823]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour, by the way, today.
[01:25:36.823 --> 01:25:41.385]  Let's go ahead and go to this Placebon piece, which, again, is some really weird art.
[01:25:41.385 --> 01:25:42.865]  The guy's really successful.
[01:25:42.865 --> 01:25:44.886]  He takes a lot of clips from the show.
[01:25:44.886 --> 01:25:46.547]  And this one, the crew likes it.
[01:25:46.547 --> 01:25:47.907]  I think it's a little over the top.
[01:25:47.907 --> 01:25:54.110]  But since Glenn Beck is imploding, this is a little hat tip to him.
[01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:58.431]  Listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[01:25:58.431 --> 01:25:59.792]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:26:04.725 --> 01:26:05.225]  Boom.
[01:26:05.225 --> 01:26:05.706]  Everywhere.
[01:26:05.706 --> 01:26:07.527]  Glen Beck.
[01:26:07.527 --> 01:26:09.067]  Mark that spot.
[01:26:09.067 --> 01:26:10.188]  The plague lies there!
[01:26:10.188 --> 01:26:11.809]  The enemy!
[01:26:11.809 --> 01:26:13.430]  There's nothing worse!
[01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:15.331]  Little, little minion.
[01:26:15.331 --> 01:26:19.693]  This little, this little, this little... Gremlin.
[01:26:19.693 --> 01:26:20.774]  Beck's not even a goblin.
[01:26:20.774 --> 01:26:22.154]  He's a gremlin.
[01:26:22.154 --> 01:26:22.955]  Glen Beck.
[01:26:22.955 --> 01:26:25.536]  Glen Beck.
[01:26:25.536 --> 01:26:27.417]  And he sits there like he's always on a toilet.
[01:26:27.417 --> 01:26:29.138]  He's in this little face like he's constipated.
[01:26:29.138 --> 01:26:32.480]  Glen Beck sits there on his chair all... He comes on like...
[01:26:33.618 --> 01:26:36.080]  He's like, where's the spot where he looks like he's constipated on the screenshot?
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.681]  Like, like back at the beginning of the video.
[01:26:37.681 --> 01:26:39.882]  It's so funny how he looks all constipated.
[01:26:39.882 --> 01:26:42.084]  Here, I'm, I'm, let's listen, here we go.
[01:26:49.679 --> 01:26:51.160]  This is what they came up with?
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:27:00.104]  Let's hear the creature that they dug up out of atheist, God-hating abortion radio, and let's hear what he has to say.
[01:27:00.104 --> 01:27:05.146]  What is frightening to me is the lack of reaction from the crowd.
[01:27:05.808 --> 01:27:06.969]  It's frightening to me.
[01:27:06.969 --> 01:27:08.351]  It's all calculated.
[01:27:08.351 --> 01:27:10.192]  He scripts with actors and hops around.
[01:27:10.192 --> 01:27:11.874]  Big candy ass on my back.
[01:27:11.874 --> 01:27:13.155]  I'm so scared.
[01:27:13.155 --> 01:27:15.217]  He said, so everybody's supposed to be scared now?
[01:27:15.217 --> 01:27:15.618]  So dumb.
[01:27:15.618 --> 01:27:16.599]  Here it is.
[01:27:16.599 --> 01:27:20.242]  Um, what is frightening to me is... Everyone hates you, but the dumbest people.
[01:27:20.242 --> 01:27:21.884]  Look how pathetic he feels.
[01:27:21.884 --> 01:27:24.427]  Like, ooh, we have the moral high ground.
[01:27:24.427 --> 01:27:25.187]  Here it is.
[01:27:25.187 --> 01:27:26.749]  Um, what is frightening to me is...
[01:27:28.618 --> 01:27:29.219]  You're a bad person!
[01:27:29.219 --> 01:27:29.920]  You're a bad person!
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:30.821]  You're a bad, bad person!
[01:27:30.821 --> 01:27:31.903]  You're a bad person!
[01:27:31.903 --> 01:27:32.724]  Piece of trash, my kid.
[01:27:55.136 --> 01:27:56.137]  I'm a pioneer!
[01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:56.637]  I'm an explorer!
[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:24.980]  I'm a human!
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:27.261]  And I'm coming!
[01:28:27.261 --> 01:28:28.301]  I'm animated!
[01:28:28.301 --> 01:28:29.802]  I'm alive!
[01:28:29.802 --> 01:28:31.522]  I'm big!
[01:28:31.522 --> 01:28:35.744]  It's got hot blood going through it!
[01:28:35.744 --> 01:28:36.444]  I'm here!
[01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:38.225]  I'm here!
[01:28:38.225 --> 01:28:40.045]  This is a human!
[01:28:40.045 --> 01:28:42.246]  This is what we look like!
[01:28:42.246 --> 01:28:42.946]  This is what we are!
[01:28:53.587 --> 01:28:55.988]  John, we're going to break here.
[01:28:55.988 --> 01:28:56.808]  When were you arrested?
[01:28:56.808 --> 01:28:57.108]  Okay.
[01:28:57.108 --> 01:28:57.769]  Come again.
[01:28:57.769 --> 01:28:58.009]  Holy hell.
[01:29:34.873 --> 01:29:38.196]  By the way, they're trying to block Sheriff Arpaio's pardon now.
[01:29:38.196 --> 01:29:41.718]  These rogue government agents will get into rogue government with Mueller.
[01:29:41.718 --> 01:29:43.019]  He really is the symbol of that.
[01:29:43.019 --> 01:29:44.941]  Your phone call straight ahead.
[01:29:44.941 --> 01:29:46.342]  We're on the march.
[01:29:46.342 --> 01:29:47.923]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.923 --> 01:29:51.566]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.990 --> 01:30:07.814]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[01:30:07.814 --> 01:30:10.355]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[01:30:10.355 --> 01:30:13.817]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[01:30:13.817 --> 01:30:16.018]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[01:30:16.018 --> 01:30:20.841]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[01:30:20.841 --> 01:30:23.722]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[01:30:23.722 --> 01:30:26.724]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews.
[01:30:26.724 --> 01:30:27.945]  4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[01:30:30.826 --> 01:30:31.727]  Unprecedented.
[01:30:31.727 --> 01:30:32.949]  And it's cold-pressed.
[01:30:32.949 --> 01:30:34.891]  That's why Super Mayo is so different.
[01:30:34.891 --> 01:30:43.301]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted in science and these are other... What you sell, they... BuzzFeed said, it's like, there's already best-selling stuff that's been certified as, you know, healthy and good forever.
[01:30:43.301 --> 01:30:44.522]  Why these aren't anything new?
[01:30:44.522 --> 01:30:48.587]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[01:30:48.587 --> 01:30:49.248]  Dude!
[01:30:49.248 --> 01:30:50.169]  Dude!

[01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:04.052]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:32:04.052 --> 01:32:09.335]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:32:09.335 --> 01:32:12.858]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warms.
[01:32:12.978 --> 01:32:13.659]  We're good to go.
[01:32:37.159 --> 01:32:38.560]  Nanosilver and more.
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:46.846]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubblegum flavored Superblue that is Spearmint free.

[01:33:10.908 --> 01:33:19.322]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:41.704 --> 01:33:49.290]  Now we're going to be taking your phone calls throughout the rest of the hour while a great person rides shotgun with us, Austin Fletcher.
[01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:51.852]  I've been seeing his videos the last year or so.
[01:33:51.852 --> 01:33:52.792]  YouTube, it's...
[01:33:53.837 --> 01:33:55.098]  Fleckas Talks.
[01:33:55.098 --> 01:33:57.740]  F-L-E-C-C-A-S Talks.
[01:33:57.740 --> 01:34:01.282]  And he's a 28-year-old Dartmouth educated journalist.
[01:34:01.282 --> 01:34:02.503]  He lives in L.A.
[01:34:02.503 --> 01:34:08.207]  where he's exposed leftist insanity on his YouTube channel, Fleckas Talks, which has millions of views.
[01:34:08.207 --> 01:34:10.569]  He's become a voice of the New Young Conservatives.
[01:34:10.569 --> 01:34:15.853]  He covers all the major protests and shows just how little the left really knows in a comedic way.
[01:34:15.853 --> 01:34:18.555]  He's a patriot fighting the left on the culture front.
[01:34:18.555 --> 01:34:19.696]  We're going to play a clip
[01:34:20.416 --> 01:34:22.818]  Here in just a moment, but you got to understand something.
[01:34:22.818 --> 01:34:27.420]  We can make a joke out of this and it's okay to laugh, but it's dangerous at the same time.
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:30.842]  It's like whistling past the graveyard, and I'm not criticizing him for laughing.
[01:34:30.842 --> 01:34:32.824]  I laugh more than he does.
[01:34:32.824 --> 01:34:37.726]  But understand, these folks see us as the existential enemy.
[01:34:37.726 --> 01:34:40.748]  So there's a bunch of clips we've got.
[01:34:40.748 --> 01:34:46.192]  So we'll just randomly go to one of them, but there was this particular clip where this guy's wrapped an American flag
[01:34:47.284 --> 01:34:47.744]  We're good to go.
[01:35:09.002 --> 01:35:21.545]  How is that personally empowering you to be a total minion when the WikiLeaks, with CNN and MSNBC, call you idiots, call you basement dwellers, call you baristas living with mommy?
[01:35:21.545 --> 01:35:22.786]  I know some baristas that make $100,000 a year.
[01:35:22.786 --> 01:35:25.727]  That's actually a pretty good job in the right town.
[01:35:25.727 --> 01:35:37.250]  The point is, they see their constituents as idiots, as disenfranchised morons, begging, wanting something, and Hillary's calling you an idiot saying you're not going to get anything free.
[01:35:38.035 --> 01:35:40.178]  You schmucks!
[01:35:40.178 --> 01:35:42.140]  Look at Obamacare.
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:43.743]  We already had free health care for poor people.
[01:35:43.743 --> 01:35:52.875]  They're getting rid of charity care now, and forcing you to pay for it, and forcing you to buy it, and ripping everybody off, and the insurance companies wrote it to rip you off, but I'm digressing.
[01:35:52.875 --> 01:35:55.298]  Let's play one of the clips of our reporter.
[01:35:57.688 --> 01:36:02.211]  It's 2017 and we're having to protest against Nazis.
[01:36:02.211 --> 01:36:06.614]  I'm here standing up against racism and the Nazis.
[01:36:06.614 --> 01:36:12.898]  I thought we got rid of them over like 50 to 70 years ago, but they're coming back.
[01:36:12.898 --> 01:36:15.099]  What's the way to defeat the Nazis in the U.S.?
[01:36:15.099 --> 01:36:16.360]  Violence.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.521]  Trotsky said it best.
[01:36:17.521 --> 01:36:24.706]  Find your Nazis, beat them, take them over their Nazi paraphernalia, and then leave them alive, hurting and bleeding, and they're cowardice.
[01:36:24.706 --> 01:36:26.247]  Same way we dealt with them in World War II.
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:28.081]  Kill them.
[01:36:28.081 --> 01:36:28.921]  There's no other way.
[01:36:28.921 --> 01:36:31.223]  That's right.
[01:36:31.223 --> 01:36:32.885]  No fascists welcome here.
[01:36:32.885 --> 01:36:34.546]  Captain America punches Nazis.
[01:36:34.546 --> 01:36:36.368]  Indiana Jones punches Nazis.
[01:36:36.368 --> 01:36:39.411]  My grandfather went and killed Nazis in Normandy and he was a f***ing hero.
[01:36:47.788 --> 01:36:49.629]  We have yet to have a perfect communist state.
[01:36:49.629 --> 01:36:50.749]  It hasn't happened yet.
[01:36:50.749 --> 01:36:52.349]  That doesn't mean we shouldn't push for it.
[01:36:52.349 --> 01:36:53.970]  Have you watched Star Trek?
[01:36:53.970 --> 01:36:55.570]  Star Trek is a communist utopia.
[01:36:55.570 --> 01:36:57.231]  That's what happens when communism wins.
[01:36:57.231 --> 01:37:01.632]  Listen, everyone is saying, oh yeah, you can't listen to CNN no more.
[01:37:01.632 --> 01:37:05.933]  You can't listen to the news anymore because it's all fake bullcrap.
[01:37:05.933 --> 01:37:08.894]  It wasn't fake before, so why is it fake now?
[01:37:08.894 --> 01:37:12.475]  The Russia story has kind of died down on those sites.
[01:37:12.475 --> 01:37:16.036]  Only because we're on the racism thing now.
[01:37:16.036 --> 01:37:16.676]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:37:17.654 --> 01:37:19.655]  Austin Fletcher, amazing work.
[01:37:19.655 --> 01:37:20.955]  Everybody should follow him.
[01:37:20.955 --> 01:37:25.156]  They're on his YouTube channel and follow us at RealAlexJones on Twitter as well.
[01:37:25.156 --> 01:37:28.697]  And of course, David Nice launched his new transmission, weekdays, 8 a.m.
[01:37:28.697 --> 01:37:29.137]  Central.
[01:37:29.137 --> 01:37:34.499]  A lot of affiliates starting to pick that up or looking to carry that syndicated radio slash TV transmission.
[01:37:34.499 --> 01:37:35.459]  And never forget that, viewers.
[01:37:35.899 --> 01:37:38.060]  We're also a syndicated radio show.
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:43.701]  That's what the format is, it's what the clock is, it's what the ads are geared for, but also television.
[01:37:43.701 --> 01:37:48.802]  We have quite a few cable and TV stations now picking up large portions of the transmission.
[01:37:48.802 --> 01:37:50.803]  So very, very thankful for all those affiliates.
[01:37:50.803 --> 01:37:59.225]  So however you're watching us now, be sure and thank those local TV stations, cable systems, and be sure and thank those local radio stations as well.
[01:37:59.225 --> 01:38:00.165]  So Austin, wow!
[01:38:01.205 --> 01:38:02.606]  Here at the office, we're big fans.
[01:38:02.606 --> 01:38:16.510]  In fact, I wanted to reach out to you and talk to you about you being a reporter for us, but simultaneously keeping your own platform because you're a go-getter, you're out there in the middle of it, and you just catch the most amazing
[01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:18.030]  I don't know.
[01:38:37.259 --> 01:38:42.644]  They're just so violent and so empowered that they now can call anybody they want a Nazi.
[01:38:42.644 --> 01:38:46.627]  Now we see Antifa being listed as a terror group.
[01:38:46.627 --> 01:38:48.549]  The Democrats are turning on them.
[01:38:48.549 --> 01:38:55.615]  But from my experience, the Democrats in general, not just classic Antifa, who are really communist, they call themselves anti-fascist.
[01:38:55.615 --> 01:38:59.278]  This is pretty much the general behavior of them overall.
[01:38:59.278 --> 01:39:02.481]  Do you think that's true from California, where you're covering this every week?
[01:39:06.132 --> 01:39:07.454]  Or are they getting more radical?
[01:39:07.454 --> 01:39:08.455]  Are they getting less radical?
[01:39:08.455 --> 01:39:10.337]  What's really happening?
[01:39:10.337 --> 01:39:12.039]  I think they're getting more radical.
[01:39:12.039 --> 01:39:16.504]  Realistically, they're buying right into the cheap story the mainstream media is selling.
[01:39:16.504 --> 01:39:18.266]  They think they're actually fighting Nazis.
[01:39:18.266 --> 01:39:24.473]  And if there were Nazis in the U.S., like don't get us wrong, the right would be the first people probably to jump in and protect American people.
[01:39:24.473 --> 01:39:25.374]  But these people think
[01:39:25.854 --> 01:39:27.036]  There's Nazis here.
[01:39:27.036 --> 01:39:28.798]  The right thing to do is fight the Nazis.
[01:39:28.798 --> 01:39:30.320]  We're justified to use violence.
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:32.403]  We have to get out there and protect the people.
[01:39:32.403 --> 01:39:35.086]  When realistically, they haven't been patriotic a day in their life.
[01:39:35.086 --> 01:39:39.452]  They just want something that's bigger than themselves to buy into and be a part of.
[01:39:39.452 --> 01:39:44.078]  And unfortunately, they believe the mainstream media when they say we have a Nazi problem.
[01:39:44.736 --> 01:40:00.165]  I think it's like stolen glory, this phenomenon of people dressing up in military uniforms and going out to community events to get money, you know, to get jobs, you name it, claiming, you know, they've got silver stars or bronze stars or we're Green Berets and we're never even in the National Guard or the Army.
[01:40:00.165 --> 01:40:10.070]  We see that and when you hear them, they're like Captain America beat up Nazis, Brad Pitt beat up Nazis in, you know, the different Quentin Tarantino movies.
[01:40:12.093 --> 01:40:18.786]  I think that's what we're dealing with here is the fantasy that they're like Captain America and this is a form of fantasy roleplay.
[01:40:19.938 --> 01:40:20.759]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:40:20.759 --> 01:40:23.482]  And fantasy role play is right up their alley.
[01:40:23.482 --> 01:40:26.645]  These people, they don't really take, you know, they don't have religion in their life.
[01:40:26.645 --> 01:40:30.628]  They don't have anything that's bigger than themselves that they can work towards and be a part of.
[01:40:30.628 --> 01:40:36.554]  So they, I mean, they think they're fighting Nazis and that would be great, but it's not what's going on.
[01:40:36.554 --> 01:40:39.717]  And now we have these people who think it's okay to use violence.
[01:40:39.717 --> 01:40:42.240]  And every protest, we saw it in Berkeley last week.
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:51.766]  Every situation where anyone from the conservative side comes out to do something publicly, they think they have a right to shut it down with violence now, when realistically, obviously, they're being the fascists.
[01:40:51.766 --> 01:40:53.267]  They're the ones who are acting like Nazis.
[01:40:53.267 --> 01:40:57.470]  They're the ones who are, you know, really pushing this communist agenda that has no place in America.
[01:40:57.935 --> 01:41:04.217]  By the way, Austin, what we're giving people is serious anthropology, sociology, cultural analysis.
[01:41:04.217 --> 01:41:05.517]  It's dead on.
[01:41:05.517 --> 01:41:18.360]  I've been saying for a year they think they're Captain America fighting Red Skull, and now in countless internet postings and videos we shoot, videos you shoot, they say, we're inglorious bastards, we're Captain America, we're destroying Hydra.
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:26.322]  Then they go beat up libertarian tranny, a transsexual, a Japanese guy, and a bunch of black guys,
[01:41:27.714 --> 01:41:30.355]  All over California, just at peaceful free speech rallies.
[01:41:30.355 --> 01:41:34.717]  But it's okay, because they say you're a Nazi, and so it's like roleplay.
[01:41:34.717 --> 01:41:36.718]  They then come and hit you in the head with a bike lock.
[01:41:36.718 --> 01:41:43.340]  They've even had major comics come out and say, I work for Red Skull.
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:46.641]  It's insane, and yeah, exactly like you said.
[01:41:46.641 --> 01:41:47.582]  They're certain.
[01:41:47.582 --> 01:41:50.203]  They're completely positive, and that's the problem, because
[01:41:50.979 --> 01:41:54.043]  I think on the upside, they are going to turn on themselves.
[01:41:54.043 --> 01:41:55.925]  They've already kind of turned on Black Lives Matter.
[01:41:55.925 --> 01:41:58.408]  They've already gotten scuffles where they're fighting themselves.
[01:41:58.408 --> 01:42:08.019]  I think with the recent disavowing from the left, which is obviously a good thing from Pelosi and those people, I think the next step is they become a kind of rogue group that no one wants to mess with at all.
[01:42:08.439 --> 01:42:09.139]  So what happened?
[01:42:09.139 --> 01:42:18.784]  Because CNN and the rest of them tried to sell it in the last six months as the vanguard, the Soros group that would fight the racists, that would fight the evil cops, that would do all this.
[01:42:18.784 --> 01:42:25.507]  When in reality, if there was 500 Nazis punching people downtown, I would go down there if the cops didn't do something to fight them.
[01:42:25.507 --> 01:42:29.608]  I mean, I'm not bragging, but I did that at the inauguration when the left wouldn't let people in.
[01:42:29.608 --> 01:42:32.750]  I mean, we physically ran over them, punched them, knocked them over because
[01:42:33.630 --> 01:42:34.512]  I'm not going to put up with it.
[01:42:34.512 --> 01:42:37.256]  I mean, I went and screamed at cops in their face and said, do something.
[01:42:37.256 --> 01:42:39.220]  They wouldn't do anything because they were controlled.
[01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:40.442]  And that's another issue.
[01:42:40.442 --> 01:42:47.294]  These are Democrat-controlled cities and Democrat-controlled universities where these carrion crows run around beating up people.
[01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:50.742]  Yeah, that's a major issue.
[01:42:50.742 --> 01:42:55.566]  The Democrat-controlled cities, because they're saying stand down to the police, and they're letting the violence happen.
[01:42:55.566 --> 01:42:57.148]  And it's only a matter of time.
[01:42:57.148 --> 01:42:59.470]  Someone's going to get killed in the next few weeks, especially.
[01:42:59.470 --> 01:43:01.592]  It's only going to get worse and worse.
[01:43:01.592 --> 01:43:04.234]  The left can disavow them all they want now, but it's almost too late.
[01:43:04.234 --> 01:43:05.916]  They've already kind of established their base.
[01:43:05.916 --> 01:43:09.339]  They've already established their power within their local communities.
[01:43:09.339 --> 01:43:10.280]  And now, I mean,
[01:43:11.405 --> 01:43:17.608]  I don't want to give too much credit to them, but they are the most, like, you know, violent group out there that, you know, is to be reckoned with.
[01:43:17.608 --> 01:43:19.028]  So we have to kind of figure out a way.
[01:43:19.028 --> 01:43:21.630]  That's why I saw what they were doing, Antifa.
[01:43:21.630 --> 01:43:25.811]  I saw the role that they were trying to play and the narrative the media gave them.
[01:43:25.811 --> 01:43:29.033]  And I, you know, as a patriot, I had to take it to the streets myself.
[01:43:29.033 --> 01:43:30.493]  And I didn't get violent with them.
[01:43:30.493 --> 01:43:31.534]  I tried to break up the fights.
[01:43:32.054 --> 01:43:46.042]  But I knew if I can get a video of them and just show how little they know, expose them, expose their, you know, tainted beliefs and discredit their whole movement, maybe both sides can come together and agree that these aren't people we should get behind.
[01:43:46.042 --> 01:43:47.002]  Well, exactly.
[01:43:47.002 --> 01:43:50.324]  I mean, you don't see big nationwide movements of real white supremacy.
[01:43:50.324 --> 01:43:54.527]  It's a very, very rare, federally run, ne'er-do-well type deal.
[01:43:55.851 --> 01:44:01.314]  With the Antifa and the left being just mean in general, we go out to events all the time all over the country.
[01:44:01.314 --> 01:44:05.697]  No one, I mean maybe one out of a thousand, will talk to us cogently.
[01:44:05.697 --> 01:44:10.600]  They just scream and hate and just stereotypically spout things.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:16.784]  I'm saying this is a big victory, obviously, that Trump said both sides are bad, but this group came starting it and that's always worse.
[01:44:16.784 --> 01:44:20.086]  Whoever initiates the violence under common sense, under common law.
[01:44:20.086 --> 01:44:22.868]  And then now, in the space of three weeks, they've gone from saying Trump's crazy
[01:44:23.368 --> 01:44:29.315]  to admitting Trump's right in the Washington Post, in the New York Times, the LA Times, Nancy Pelosi.
[01:44:29.315 --> 01:44:31.198]  A. How big a victory is that?
[01:44:31.198 --> 01:44:33.120]  What does it signify to you?
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:37.866]  And don't you think Trump should now victory lap and say, see, you know, I've been proven right?
[01:44:39.201 --> 01:44:41.582]  Yeah, I think a victory lap would be appropriate.
[01:44:41.582 --> 01:44:49.683]  I think, you know, if he could use his different forms of social media to get that message out there, that would definitely be beneficial to his cause and bringing the people together.
[01:44:49.683 --> 01:44:52.544]  Because realistically, the bigger goal is to bring people together.
[01:44:52.544 --> 01:44:56.965]  And it was unfortunate to see the left siding with Antifa, because I know Antifa firsthand.
[01:44:56.965 --> 01:44:58.085]  I've seen these people.
[01:44:58.085 --> 01:45:03.346]  And I knew, like, even the left, for as crazy as the things they've spouted sometimes, they don't want to be involved with Antifa.
[01:45:03.846 --> 01:45:06.568]  So, I think this is a big step.
[01:45:06.568 --> 01:45:18.979]  I think the violence will continue, but the more the violence continues, the more they get discredited and the quicker everyone can kind of come together away from them and realize maybe we're, you know, not as different as the extremes made us think.
[01:45:18.979 --> 01:45:19.920]  Exactly!
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:21.721]  What do you think CNN and MSNBC...
[01:45:22.722 --> 01:45:29.827]  And even NPR were thinking, and the New York Times, and they tried to mainline Antifa and go, well, violence is good because we're going to punch a Nazi.
[01:45:29.827 --> 01:45:33.410]  Didn't they know that would mean anybody that they projected onto?
[01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:39.014]  The classic thing is, well, the average good old boys wouldn't go rob anybody because they're good Christians.
[01:45:39.014 --> 01:45:44.699]  But if it's a gay club, you can go beat somebody up and rob them and take their wallet or steal their car because, you know, they're
[01:45:45.239 --> 01:45:47.280]  Yeah, and it's scary, but at the same time I think the media
[01:46:13.607 --> 01:46:13.867]  They're lost.
[01:46:37.168 --> 01:46:37.689]  Exactly.
[01:46:37.689 --> 01:46:44.255]  This thing to look up to, to be a part of, to be involved with their... And so they believe they're Brad Pitt and inglorious bastards?
[01:46:44.255 --> 01:46:45.076]  They think that.
[01:46:45.076 --> 01:46:53.585]  And it's scary, because if anything like that actually happened, and we needed America to step up and defend against domestic terrorists, it would be the patriots going against them, realistically.
[01:46:54.462 --> 01:47:02.286]  Well, that's right, and it's very insulting to have a weirdo Nazi collaborator for the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL say, I'm a Nazi.
[01:47:02.286 --> 01:47:06.088]  I mean, he funds it, they say that, they do that, they have Tom Brokaw say it.
[01:47:06.088 --> 01:47:13.992]  It's very insulting as an American, when both my grandfathers did, both of them, one of them crashed land on the other, actually had
[01:47:15.353 --> 01:47:22.821]  Sunburn in his eyes, the one day he didn't go up, the plane blew up and everybody got killed, you know, over Italy and the Italy invasion on North Africa.
[01:47:22.821 --> 01:47:25.884]  And it almost not exists because of Nazis.
[01:47:25.884 --> 01:47:29.568]  And then I'm being called a Nazi by a real, living Nazi.
[01:47:29.568 --> 01:47:31.790]  Where are the Nazi hunters for George Soros?
[01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:38.397]  He went on 60 Minutes and said he's not ashamed of helping round up his fellow Jews because they would have killed him.
[01:47:38.897 --> 01:47:40.478]  What type of moral statement is that?
[01:47:40.478 --> 01:47:46.461]  I've had high-level Hollywood producers go, Alex, we want to put a big movie out with you, this is like six, seven years ago, but you've got to quit bashing Soros.
[01:47:46.461 --> 01:47:48.322]  You know, he definitely needed to survive.
[01:47:48.322 --> 01:47:52.965]  If they came to me and said, round up your fellow Americans, we're going to kill you, I'd say pull the trigger, you bastard!
[01:47:55.310 --> 01:48:04.213]  Yeah, it's insane, and it's almost like a big joke, I think, from Soros, where he calls the group, you know, the anti-fascists, when meanwhile they're the most fascist group in America.
[01:48:04.213 --> 01:48:13.196]  It's almost like a big joke that is over their head completely, that they don't understand, and they're just the pawns that bought in, that are mindless drones now, heading towards, you know, the common goal.
[01:48:13.977 --> 01:48:18.361]  Um, I think with situations like this, we have to be careful with how we combat them.
[01:48:18.361 --> 01:48:21.084]  We have to come at them in a way that's not playing on their terms.
[01:48:21.084 --> 01:48:22.846]  We don't want to get violent, obviously.
[01:48:22.846 --> 01:48:29.714]  So I think the sooner we can expose them and show how clueless they are, the sooner everyone can kind of step away from them and disavow completely both sides.
[01:48:30.469 --> 01:48:31.290]  That's right.
[01:48:31.290 --> 01:48:32.891]  It's being reported right now by RT.
[01:48:32.891 --> 01:48:38.477]  I want to post the full article on Infowars.com and Newswars.com, folks, and we're going to tweet this out.
[01:48:38.477 --> 01:48:43.362]  There's now 70,000 petitions to designate Soros as a terrorist and seize his assets.
[01:48:43.362 --> 01:48:46.245]  There's scores of countries have already convicted him.
[01:48:46.245 --> 01:48:48.127]  He's been caught doing it.
[01:48:48.127 --> 01:48:51.791]  And look, you know, we called for Antifa to be listed as a criminal gang.
[01:48:51.791 --> 01:48:53.633]  Turns out the FBI has declassified
[01:48:55.114 --> 01:48:57.635]  The fact that they've already been listed as that for a year.
[01:48:57.635 --> 01:49:04.300]  So this is a big move and it's time for us to morally call, where are the Israeli Nazi hunters?
[01:49:04.300 --> 01:49:08.362]  They're always finding some 90 year old guard they're not sure and then having a trial.
[01:49:08.362 --> 01:49:10.183]  This is a real Nazi.
[01:49:10.183 --> 01:49:12.105]  Just because he's Jewish doesn't give him any excuse.
[01:49:12.105 --> 01:49:14.126]  This guy needs to be SWAT teamed.
[01:49:16.169 --> 01:49:17.410]  Absolutely, yeah.
[01:49:17.410 --> 01:49:23.375]  The comments he made about his involvement during, you know, in Nazi Germany are ridiculous.
[01:49:23.375 --> 01:49:27.499]  And if anyone else was even associated with that on the right, we would not hear the end of it.
[01:49:27.499 --> 01:49:34.845]  But the fact that he said what he said, he's over the years even said things about, you know, wanting to destroy the United States, made a comment about that in the 70s.
[01:49:34.845 --> 01:49:38.068]  It's just, it's so in our face, it's so blatant.
[01:49:38.068 --> 01:49:40.990]  It's kind of the same thing that happens with someone like Linda Sarsour.
[01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:43.533]  They're so in our face and so obvious and
[01:49:44.213 --> 01:49:55.482]  It's so against our cultural beliefs, but it just kind of gets ignored, and we fantasize about, you know, the Nazis in the U.S., when realistically, the fascist groups we're dealing with are funded by the Nazis.
[01:49:55.482 --> 01:49:57.944]  It's ridiculous.
[01:49:57.944 --> 01:49:58.564]  That's right.
[01:49:58.564 --> 01:49:58.905]  Wow.
[01:49:58.905 --> 01:50:01.767]  I want to come back, take a few segments of calls with Austin Fletcher.
[01:50:03.982 --> 01:50:14.079]  Austin, do you think Antifa and leftist insanity has peaked, or is this a momentary setback as kind of America really gets sickened by them, and are they about to get even worse?
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:20.042]  I think we're at a juncture here for sure.
[01:50:20.042 --> 01:50:24.444]  I think Antifa is going to get worse and they're going to go more rogue and further left.
[01:50:24.444 --> 01:50:32.428]  Separate themselves from everybody, but I think there'll be an upside there as well because we kind of need something for the country to get behind.
[01:50:32.428 --> 01:50:39.692]  Obviously the situation in Texas with Harvey was horrible, but with the upside is that's when America comes together when times are bad.
[01:50:39.692 --> 01:50:41.213]  I was about to say, get Harvey.
[01:50:42.193 --> 01:50:46.997]  Basically, did the reigns of Harvey, as bad as they were, put out the race war Soros wanted?
[01:50:46.997 --> 01:50:49.218]  That was my next question when we come back.
[01:50:49.218 --> 01:50:55.763]  And by the way, you know, it was James Wesley Rawls and our other great Pentagon sources that predicted Antifa will become the weatherman next.
[01:50:55.763 --> 01:50:59.286]  Are you one of the 15 million men who suffer from an enlarged prostate?

[01:55:55.116 --> 01:55:59.798]  Despite Google and Facebook and Twitter's censorship and all their attempts, we're turning the tide.
[01:55:59.798 --> 01:56:00.359]  We're winning.
[01:56:01.172 --> 01:56:19.330]  Now again, we've got a very popular YouTuber, Austin Fletcher, with Fleckus Talks, out in LA, showing amazing footage of the Libtards, who are very, very sad people, but, you know, hopefully by illustrating that they're not intellectual, that they are the victims of the globalist system, we can wake them up.
[01:56:19.330 --> 01:56:23.133]  Follow him on Twitter, at Fleckus, as well.
[01:56:23.133 --> 01:56:24.775]  Okay, I want to go to
[01:56:25.856 --> 01:56:27.577]  Thanks Alex, I'm enjoying this segment with you in Austin.
[01:56:27.577 --> 01:56:29.899]  I want to point out a false equivalency.
[01:56:29.899 --> 01:56:32.961]  I want to tell you what's equivalent and what's not.
[01:56:32.961 --> 01:56:33.481]  Right now the
[01:56:52.901 --> 01:56:57.766]  Polar opposites are Antifa, and the white supremacists are Nazis.
[01:56:57.766 --> 01:57:00.729]  That's what we're being fed as an equivalence.
[01:57:00.729 --> 01:57:07.917]  The true equivalents are white supremacists are Nazis, black supremacists are Black Lives Matter, or Bloxies.
[01:57:08.735 --> 01:57:09.095]  I think?
[01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:33.313]  We accept that even though we may not take those views because we, the First Amendment.
[01:57:33.313 --> 01:57:43.882]  But the second that Antifa starts getting violent, I don't care if you're a movement on the left, center, right, white, Mexican, black, Chinese, whatever.
[01:57:43.882 --> 01:57:45.844]  The second you start getting violent,
[01:57:46.624 --> 01:57:49.307]  This is no longer a First Amendment issue.
[01:57:49.307 --> 01:57:51.749]  These people need to be arrested, frankly.
[01:57:51.749 --> 01:57:52.070]  No, I agree.
[01:57:52.070 --> 01:57:54.572]  They need to have their asses handed to them.
[01:57:54.572 --> 01:58:01.319]  I want to give conservatives really a laurel, and just people that were out being beat up and letting them beat them up, because I can't do that.
[01:58:01.319 --> 01:58:03.942]  I mean, I let them throw coffee on me and stuff.
[01:58:03.942 --> 01:58:06.905]  It really blew up in their face that we took the Gandhi road.
[01:58:10.976 --> 01:58:11.738]  Stay there, Embry.
[01:58:11.738 --> 01:58:14.526]  I'm going to come back to you after the break and with our other guest, Austin.
[01:58:14.526 --> 01:58:18.498]  Austin, do you agree that conservatives taking the Gandhi Road really blew up in the leftist faces?
[01:58:19.437 --> 01:58:20.638]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:58:20.638 --> 01:58:22.119]  And I think it's something they didn't expect.
[01:58:22.119 --> 01:58:25.662]  They kind of thought they'd be baiting us into, you know, engaging in violence.
[01:58:25.662 --> 01:58:30.606]  When realistically, like with my channel at least, I know that they're used to fighting the emotional fight.
[01:58:30.606 --> 01:58:32.748]  They're used to getting, you know, loud in each other's faces.
[01:58:32.748 --> 01:58:35.250]  Stand there, I want to hear about this, but let me tell you.
[01:58:35.250 --> 01:58:38.733]  Wise as serpents, peaceful as doves, walks softly, carry a big stick.
[01:58:38.733 --> 01:58:41.295]  I mean, just great self-control, folks.
[01:58:41.295 --> 01:58:42.856]  Real intellect.
[01:58:42.856 --> 01:58:43.817]  Real will.
[01:58:43.817 --> 01:58:44.478]  You're beautiful.
[01:58:47.398 --> 01:58:47.898]  Not a group.
[01:58:47.898 --> 01:58:49.319]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:58:49.319 --> 01:58:50.680]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:51.881]  Why is this so good?
[01:58:51.881 --> 01:58:57.164]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:58:57.164 --> 01:59:10.713]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:59:10.713 --> 01:59:12.074]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:59:12.854 --> 01:59:14.495]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:59:14.495 --> 01:59:17.016]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:59:17.016 --> 01:59:18.377]  These are all parasites.
[01:59:18.377 --> 01:59:19.478]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:59:19.478 --> 01:59:20.818]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:59:20.818 --> 01:59:25.321]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:59:25.321 --> 01:59:28.482]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:59:28.482 --> 01:59:31.664]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:59:31.664 --> 01:59:32.705]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:59:32.705 --> 01:59:34.626]  LivingDefense, InfowarsLife.com.
[01:59:34.626 --> 01:59:35.666]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:59:35.666 --> 01:59:38.388]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:59:38.388 --> 01:59:38.488]  And...
[01:59:39.108 --> 01:59:40.228]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:40.228 --> 01:59:43.189]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:12.210 --> 02:00:21.153]  Embry, what's great about talking to libertarians and patriots of every race, color, and creed is they're just humans and they're smart.
[02:00:21.153 --> 02:00:24.795]  And it doesn't mean we don't have some dull knives in our drawers as well.
[02:00:24.795 --> 02:00:26.715]  And a few of us have screws loose.
[02:00:26.715 --> 02:00:27.495]  I think I do.
[02:00:30.054 --> 02:00:31.215]  Genius and crazy, they say.
[02:00:31.215 --> 02:00:31.875]  It's a close thing.
[02:00:31.875 --> 02:00:35.838]  I'm not claiming I'm on the genius side, but a little bit on the crazy side.
[02:00:35.838 --> 02:00:41.783]  But, classic Black Lives Matter, classic Metrola Raza, they're the same thing as white supremacist groups.
[02:00:41.783 --> 02:00:43.244]  They're race-based groups, and I get it.
[02:00:43.244 --> 02:00:45.385]  They think they've been attacked, they're getting into a group.
[02:00:45.385 --> 02:00:46.266]  It's primitive.
[02:00:46.266 --> 02:00:50.830]  The Christian ethos is this big open thing, and it makes successful societies.
[02:00:50.830 --> 02:00:53.932]  The question is, the Democrats, the globals are trying to sabotage it.
[02:00:53.932 --> 02:00:54.712]  What do we do about it?
[02:00:54.712 --> 02:00:56.534]  Then I'll ask Austin Fletcher the same question.
[02:00:58.348 --> 02:01:03.332]  Well, you hit something at the break that is so true, and it's actually given me hope.
[02:01:03.332 --> 02:01:18.386]  I've been pretty dark for a couple months with all this, but what I'm encouraged by is that we have not reacted ridiculous violence with these violent people, and we are going to defeat these people and still be right.
[02:01:18.386 --> 02:01:20.468]  And I'm really, really encouraged by that.
[02:01:21.155 --> 02:01:22.035]  We are defeating them.
[02:01:22.035 --> 02:01:22.656]  God bless you.
[02:01:22.656 --> 02:01:23.696]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:23.696 --> 02:01:25.336]  Embry made some great points.
[02:01:25.336 --> 02:01:27.097]  Austin, the empire is going to strike back though.
[02:01:27.097 --> 02:01:33.079]  The establishment engineers are kind of backing away from their little minions right now because it's exposed the fraud.
[02:01:33.079 --> 02:01:34.720]  But how are they going to strike back?
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:35.680]  You know they're not going to give up.
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:38.741]  I mean, Mueller wants to cook something up on Trump.
[02:01:38.741 --> 02:01:42.622]  They're claiming a judge can block Trump's pardon right now.
[02:01:42.622 --> 02:01:43.923]  They're really going after Trump.
[02:01:43.923 --> 02:01:47.704]  And he's not perfect, but I think if they get our figurehead, that will embolden them.
[02:01:49.085 --> 02:01:50.646]  Absolutely.
[02:01:50.646 --> 02:01:54.387]  I think right now the good news is we're on the right side of history.
[02:01:54.387 --> 02:01:55.367]  We're the good guys.
[02:01:55.367 --> 02:02:00.029]  We're an underdog story for sure, which is my favorite kind of thing to be a part of.
[02:02:00.029 --> 02:02:01.209]  I love the underdog story.
[02:02:01.209 --> 02:02:02.470]  I love fighting the good fight.
[02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:08.452]  I love being based in facts and honesty and, you know, love for the country at a bigger level.
[02:02:08.452 --> 02:02:09.332]  You love being centered.
[02:02:09.332 --> 02:02:10.193]  You love being informed.
[02:02:10.193 --> 02:02:11.213]  You love being connected to God.
[02:02:12.239 --> 02:02:12.680]  Exactly.
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:13.742]  I really do.
[02:02:13.742 --> 02:02:15.787]  And that's what the left lacks.
[02:02:15.787 --> 02:02:22.681]  And I think the left, like we were mentioning before, is used to the tactics of getting violent and baiting people and starting, you know, civil unrest.
[02:02:22.681 --> 02:02:23.282]  Dirty tricks!
[02:02:24.096 --> 02:02:24.776]  Dirty tricks.
[02:02:24.776 --> 02:02:37.685]  And the new rights response now, which they weren't expecting, is debating in facts and having conversations and being the peaceful ones and having group events that include minorities and all this different diversity of all different types of people.
[02:02:37.685 --> 02:02:39.727]  And we're playing them in their own game in a way.
[02:02:39.727 --> 02:02:41.047]  And they don't know how to react to it.
[02:02:41.047 --> 02:02:48.593]  So the more violent they get, the worse they look, the sooner we... Plus, it was Republicans that were in abolition and the Republicans that passed the Civil Rights Act.
[02:02:48.593 --> 02:02:50.474]  We just let the left hijack all that.
[02:02:51.892 --> 02:02:52.592]  Yeah, we did.
[02:02:52.592 --> 02:03:03.016]  And it's unfortunate now because whenever we tell them, you know, the left is responsible for the KKK, the Democrats and the KKK went hand-in-hand for years and years.
[02:03:03.016 --> 02:03:06.857]  The big switch was actually not a big switch.
[02:03:06.857 --> 02:03:15.640]  They don't believe it because we're like the right-wing conspiracy people when realistically we're based in facts and they just rather live in this world of ignorance where they can kind of keep floating around with peace
[02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:27.265]  Well, sure, the Democrats joined the Communists and joined all these other groups, and then Conservatives went, no, no, we're not going to have race war, we're not saying whites are bad or something, we're going to not be racist, we're going to be fair.
[02:03:27.265 --> 02:03:35.149]  That's what old-line Barry Goldwater Republicans did, and then now you look at the Democrats, I mean, WikiLeaks, it just says we're going to use culture war.
[02:03:35.149 --> 02:03:35.989]  That means race war.
[02:03:35.989 --> 02:03:36.650]  That's their plan.
[02:03:38.157 --> 02:03:38.978]  Yeah.
[02:03:38.978 --> 02:03:40.180]  And it's getting tricky.
[02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:42.403]  And it's like you said before, it's dirty tricks.
[02:03:42.403 --> 02:03:43.805]  It's all they can do now.
[02:03:43.805 --> 02:03:45.648]  So we have to know their game.
[02:03:45.648 --> 02:03:47.992]  We know the game they're playing, how they play it.
[02:03:47.992 --> 02:03:51.997]  We got to just in their face, combat them in every way we can non-violently.
[02:03:51.997 --> 02:03:53.179]  And that's what I do with my channel.
[02:03:53.179 --> 02:03:53.480]  It's like,
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:57.743]  You know, they're used to fighting these emotional wars and getting in people's faces and baiting people.
[02:03:57.743 --> 02:04:01.946]  They're not used to someone, you know, with a microphone in their face saying, like, oh, what are you doing here?
[02:04:01.946 --> 02:04:02.866]  Like, super calm.
[02:04:02.866 --> 02:04:11.552]  And that's where they fail, because they aren't based in facts, they aren't based in truth and honesty, and that's where they can't back up their, you know, radical ideas.
[02:04:11.552 --> 02:04:18.577]  They truly are lost followers of a system that's abusing them, and so they run into a real intellectual, they're destroyed.
[02:04:20.490 --> 02:04:20.991]  Absolutely.
[02:04:20.991 --> 02:04:23.513]  The left is just, this has been their game forever.
[02:04:23.513 --> 02:04:29.359]  They just prey on the minds of the people who aren't involved in politics, don't care.
[02:04:29.359 --> 02:04:36.426]  All of my friends, you know, anyone under 30 I know out in LA especially, I ask them about politics and they'll say, oh, you know, that pardon was bad.
[02:04:36.426 --> 02:04:37.387]  And I'll say, why was it bad?
[02:04:37.387 --> 02:04:38.829]  And they don't even know what the, you know,
[02:04:39.309 --> 02:04:39.750]  What the guy did.
[02:04:58.001 --> 02:05:04.825]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[02:05:04.825 --> 02:05:07.366]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[02:05:07.366 --> 02:05:10.828]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[02:05:10.828 --> 02:05:13.029]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[02:05:13.029 --> 02:05:17.852]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality non-concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[02:05:17.852 --> 02:05:20.733]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[02:05:20.733 --> 02:05:24.936]  It's never been the price it is right now, with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[02:05:27.837 --> 02:05:28.758]  Unprecedented.
[02:05:28.758 --> 02:05:29.959]  And it's cold-pressed.
[02:05:29.959 --> 02:05:31.901]  That's why Super Mayo is so different.
[02:05:31.901 --> 02:05:34.863]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted in science.
[02:05:34.863 --> 02:05:38.246]  These are other, what you sell, they, BuzzFeed said, it's like, it's already best-selling stuff.
[02:05:38.246 --> 02:05:40.308]  It's been certified as, you know, healthy and good forever.
[02:05:40.308 --> 02:05:41.529]  Why these aren't anything new?
[02:05:41.529 --> 02:05:45.573]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[02:05:45.573 --> 02:05:45.793]  Duh.
[02:05:45.793 --> 02:05:46.153]  Duh.
[02:05:53.376 --> 02:06:03.984]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:06:03.984 --> 02:06:06.046]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:06:06.046 --> 02:06:08.908]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:06:08.908 --> 02:06:10.409]  It's made in the USA.
[02:06:10.409 --> 02:06:13.532]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[02:06:13.752 --> 02:06:17.214]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:06:17.214 --> 02:06:19.295]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:06:19.295 --> 02:06:29.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:41.527]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[02:06:41.527 --> 02:06:45.814]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:06:45.814 --> 02:06:49.099]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together we're changing the world.
[02:06:49.099 --> 02:06:52.265]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:06:53.522 --> 02:07:01.784]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[02:07:01.784 --> 02:07:03.005]  A 360 win.
[02:07:03.005 --> 02:07:09.567]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:07:09.567 --> 02:07:17.089]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:07:17.489 --> 02:07:22.171]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:07:22.171 --> 02:07:28.673]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:07:28.673 --> 02:07:36.456]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:07:36.456 --> 02:07:42.978]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:07:42.978 --> 02:07:44.479]  10% off on auto ship.
[02:07:44.619 --> 02:07:47.062]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:47.062 --> 02:07:49.045]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:07:49.045 --> 02:07:52.911]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:08:03.314 --> 02:08:05.955]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:05.955 --> 02:08:11.796]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:11.796 --> 02:08:24.119]  Alright, Mike Cernovich is running late, but he'll be popping in in the fourth hour, so we're going to have Jack Pasovic and Owen Schroer.
[02:08:24.119 --> 02:08:30.601]  And I tell you, Owen Schroer, it is so good to see him going from awesome to unbelievably awesome.
[02:08:31.417 --> 02:08:37.705]  It's like I've seen Paul Watson grow into a powerful Jedi.
[02:08:37.705 --> 02:08:41.629]  A new apprentice, younger and more powerful.
[02:08:41.629 --> 02:08:43.091]  Anyways, but...
[02:08:45.518 --> 02:08:49.782]  Darth Shroyer is going to be very, very good when it comes to taking on the globalists.
[02:08:49.782 --> 02:08:57.831]  Of course, we've got Jack Posobiec just kicking butt out of the gates the last few years, running one of the biggest PACs out there, supporting President Trump.
[02:08:57.831 --> 02:09:03.176]  CitizensforTrump.com, follow him at Jack Posobiec on Twitter and everywhere else.
[02:09:03.176 --> 02:09:06.359]  So he'll be back after he leaves in 30 minutes.
[02:09:06.359 --> 02:09:08.221]  I want to get some calls in while he's here with us.
[02:09:09.403 --> 02:09:14.274]  Jack, how big a victory, because you know me, I don't just hype up victories, neither do you.
[02:09:14.274 --> 02:09:18.863]  When we're down, I'll tell folks, and people get mad at me sometimes, but in three weeks...
[02:09:19.841 --> 02:09:31.810]  To go from Trump saying both sides are bad, that whole stage thing they had up there, there were some real white supremacists, but the whole thing was Democrat-run, all three of the white supremacist leaders were, you know, a year ago were working for the Democrats, I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[02:09:31.810 --> 02:09:43.119]  To have all of that going on, and then three weeks later, the Democrats have to go, okay, Antifa is a criminal group, they're a gang, they're a terror group, we're sorry, because they're beating up multiracial libertarian prayer vigils, I mean,
[02:09:44.503 --> 02:09:51.305]  It's like they all showed up to battle Red Skull or to beat the brains out of some Nazi, and then it turned out nobody was a Nazi.
[02:09:51.305 --> 02:10:05.029]  It has blown up spectacularly, and then here comes the hurricane, very unfortunate, raining out 10 million people metro, but bringing folks together with the images of people pulling together, you could like feel the evil energy subsiding.
[02:10:05.029 --> 02:10:07.769]  So let's get into that, but how does the empire strike back?
[02:10:07.769 --> 02:10:09.590]  Because you've got people like
[02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:21.315]  Dan Rather rubbing his little fake news hands together, saying, don't worry, Mueller will bring everyone down, don't worry.
[02:10:21.315 --> 02:10:27.718]  This rogue government, they have a judge saying she's going to ignore the president, and Arpaio's still going to jail.
[02:10:28.138 --> 02:10:38.827]  Well, that's like these courts saying you couldn't block people from unvetted Islamic countries where they hand out, you know, Imams hand out the passports in failed, bombed out states that don't have airports.
[02:10:38.827 --> 02:10:41.029]  And of course the Supreme Court said 9-0.
[02:10:41.029 --> 02:10:49.456]  This is total rogue government telling American people we don't matter and that they're going to arrest our President.
[02:10:49.456 --> 02:10:51.157]  So, that's the big deal.
[02:10:51.157 --> 02:10:53.159]  How big is the victory, but how do they strike back?
[02:10:54.093 --> 02:10:59.915]  Yeah Alex, it's amazing to see how fast the information environment is changing.
[02:10:59.915 --> 02:11:12.419]  You understand this, you understand the information warfare that we're in right now, the fact that this is fourth generation, political, when we say warfare we mean rhetorical, we mean information, we mean ideas, not physical like the left means.
[02:11:12.419 --> 02:11:17.201]  We're not talking about that, but the information environment is changing on a minute by minute
[02:11:17.601 --> 02:11:22.142]  And it's happening so rapidly that the American people are catching up with it now.
[02:11:22.142 --> 02:11:25.522]  Now, normally they would say, oh, we've always disavowed Antifa.
[02:11:25.522 --> 02:11:27.383]  We've always disavowed, we've always said they were wrong.
[02:11:27.383 --> 02:11:28.583]  Excuse me, no, no, no, no.
[02:11:28.583 --> 02:11:40.785]  Two days ago, you guys were saying, two minutes ago, you guys were saying that you supported them, you were comparing them to the invader, you know, the invasion of Normandy, and saying that they were like the allies crashing through against the Nazis.
[02:11:40.785 --> 02:11:42.546]  And now suddenly, oh yeah, we condemn these guys too.
[02:11:42.546 --> 02:11:43.886]  It's like, whoa, wait a minute.
[02:11:43.886 --> 02:11:44.406]  You guys
[02:11:45.166 --> 02:11:50.770]  Immediately flipped over what you were saying, and Alex, it's because so many people have woken up these days.
[02:11:50.770 --> 02:12:05.259]  So many people have been turned on by social media, by Infowars, by independent media, independent news sources out there, that they realize that they are doing backflips and mental gymnastics to have to keep up with us because we are catching them in their lies.
[02:12:05.259 --> 02:12:08.881]  We are catching them every time they come out with these double statements.
[02:12:09.141 --> 02:12:19.890]  And we're forcing them with the power of videos, citizen journalism, and so many people out there exposing the violence on both sides, for them to say, hey guys, this side clearly is violent too.
[02:12:19.890 --> 02:12:23.393]  Trump was 100% right, and now you've agreed with him.
[02:12:23.393 --> 02:12:32.521]  Paul Ryan, who condemned, completely condemned President Trump for calling out Antifa violence, is now also calling out Antifa violence.
[02:12:32.521 --> 02:12:34.243]  It's like we're living in the Twilight Zone.
[02:12:34.543 --> 02:12:38.726]  But the issue is, this is how that side has always been.
[02:12:38.726 --> 02:12:40.667]  They've always been doing stuff like this.
[02:12:40.667 --> 02:12:53.774]  It's now that they're feedered to the fire because there are other sources of information out there because of the internet, and that's why they want to shut us down, and that they're forced to respond to all of the facts and all of the truth that we're pointing out.
[02:12:53.774 --> 02:13:01.159]  And the stuff that you're talking about, the reason that we have this victory now, is they're realizing that they've got to shut down
[02:13:02.163 --> 02:13:06.104]  And we're seeing it now.
[02:13:06.104 --> 02:13:09.365]  We've been talking about it with YouTube for over a year at this point.
[02:13:09.365 --> 02:13:10.826]  Facebook for over a year.
[02:13:10.826 --> 02:13:12.046]  Now Google is getting on it.
[02:13:12.046 --> 02:13:15.147]  And Google is sort of like the head honcho of the tech world, right?
[02:13:15.147 --> 02:13:17.568]  Everyone knows that every, you know, it all runs downhill from Google.
[02:13:17.568 --> 02:13:27.271]  And we now know they contacted Forbes and said, we're going to delist you and ban you if you don't change an article or remove it, dictating that they said it was racist.
[02:13:27.271 --> 02:13:30.772]  So it just shows Google becomes the national censor.
[02:13:32.045 --> 02:13:36.727]  Yeah, this isn't, you know, Forbes is not somebody with a, it's not Jack Posobiec with a blog.
[02:13:36.727 --> 02:13:42.850]  Forbes is an organization, they were a magazine for many, many, many years, completely non-partisan guys.
[02:13:42.850 --> 02:13:46.512]  I could quibble with some of their... Yeah, they finance Fox, they have their own Fox News show.
[02:13:46.512 --> 02:13:52.755]  This is a multi-billion dollar operation, and they're being told, hey, you're going to be denied access if you don't do what we say.
[02:13:53.886 --> 02:14:01.935]  And if Google can do that, and see what they're saying is, they say, oh, we're not going to take down your website, we're not going to hack you, but we're just not going to list you in search results.
[02:14:01.935 --> 02:14:05.459]  And we're going to monetarily not let you advertise.
[02:14:05.459 --> 02:14:06.680]  Let's stop right there.
[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:08.102]  I don't know how to promote this.
[02:14:08.102 --> 02:14:08.842]  It's so big.
[02:14:09.503 --> 02:14:10.364]  It happened yesterday.
[02:14:10.364 --> 02:14:12.386]  It's only got 62,000 views.
[02:14:12.386 --> 02:14:14.008]  It needs 10 million views.
[02:14:14.008 --> 02:14:17.332]  Colonel Schaefer, as you know, tied into all the big black op operations.
[02:14:17.332 --> 02:14:19.955]  You know, highest level exposed Benghazi.
[02:14:19.955 --> 02:14:24.299]  He confirmed yesterday a deep state plan to kill Trump.
[02:14:24.299 --> 02:14:25.280]  They've been announcing it.
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:26.422]  They've been preparing it.
[02:14:26.422 --> 02:14:28.524]  This exposes the entire program.
[02:14:29.605 --> 02:14:35.068]  This headline, I'm going to retweet it on Paul's tweet, your tweet, I need to get Cernovich to tweet it.
[02:14:35.068 --> 02:14:37.589]  He confirms, I mean, the headline's not strong enough.
[02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:38.509]  Emergency.
[02:14:38.509 --> 02:14:41.231]  Colonel Schaefer confirms treasonous plan to assassinate Trump.
[02:14:41.231 --> 02:14:42.491]  I mean, how about this?
[02:14:42.491 --> 02:14:47.974]  High-level black ops colonel warns America of ongoing plot to...
[02:14:48.194 --> 02:14:49.535]  to kill the president.
[02:14:49.535 --> 02:14:54.617]  And he even names who's involved and confirms that they're going to go after all of us once they do.
[02:14:54.617 --> 02:14:57.438]  I mean, folks, this guy has all the connections, OK?
[02:14:57.438 --> 02:15:00.720]  And this is a major Fox News military analyst.
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:02.100]  So, I mean, there's your headline.
[02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:02.921]  We should retweet it.
[02:15:02.921 --> 02:15:06.723]  Top, you know, high-level Fox News, Fox News military analyst.
[02:15:07.643 --> 02:15:11.268]  Warns of secret plans to assassinate the President.
[02:15:11.268 --> 02:15:15.153]  I mean, this is, this is... You could even say, I would even, maybe something like, whistleblower.
[02:15:15.153 --> 02:15:16.855]  Blows the whistle.
[02:15:16.855 --> 02:15:17.375]  That's right.
[02:15:17.375 --> 02:15:19.939]  Army colonel blows the whistle on a plan to kill Trump.
[02:15:20.939 --> 02:15:24.961]  Right, because people need to understand that this isn't somebody... He's sticking his neck out!
[02:15:24.961 --> 02:15:27.102]  He gets chewed out when he does this.
[02:15:27.102 --> 02:15:28.103]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:15:28.103 --> 02:15:31.364]  Yeah, he's someone who's been involved in these operations.
[02:15:31.364 --> 02:15:40.249]  He's been someone who's seen the black ops, who's seen that the agency will go around the world and pick and choose who gets to rule which world, country.
[02:15:40.729 --> 02:15:41.090]  We're good to go.
[02:15:56.328 --> 02:15:58.310]  And Jack, this isn't hype!
[02:15:58.310 --> 02:16:00.912]  They've got Tillerson arrogantly putting down the president.
[02:16:00.912 --> 02:16:02.774]  They've got Cohen doing it.
[02:16:02.774 --> 02:16:08.420]  You've got all these cowards that have gotten the call and told, we're going to take him out, line up, put up with it, you'll be okay.
[02:16:08.420 --> 02:16:12.684]  And they're talking about new elections and then permanently shutting down free web.
[02:16:12.684 --> 02:16:14.946]  This is the big move against America.
[02:16:14.946 --> 02:16:19.671]  But just like Antifa blew up in their face, if we hold fast and speak out, it's going to blow up in their face.
[02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:23.804]  Yeah, they are, because people aren't going to sit by and stand by that.
[02:16:23.804 --> 02:16:31.374]  They're going to make it look like it was, oh, it was a car accident or, oh, there was just an accident that something happened or it was crazy or something like that.
[02:16:31.374 --> 02:16:35.519]  And that is why they're using this violent rhetoric more and more and more.
[02:16:35.519 --> 02:16:40.145]  And they're using the same type of rhetoric as if you saw The New York Times had a piece earlier this week.
[02:16:40.805 --> 02:16:44.489]  Um, where it was, it was an op-ed and they can say, Oh, it's not, it was, it was not news.
[02:16:44.489 --> 02:16:45.189]  It was an op-ed.
[02:16:45.189 --> 02:16:46.170]  So they can get away with it.
[02:16:46.170 --> 02:16:53.376]  They think by saying that, that president Trump is trying to raise a militia groups to go after blue States and blue cities.
[02:16:53.376 --> 02:17:08.048]  So they're trying to position it, that Trump is the enemy and that people need to go after Trump so that the information environment, as we just talked about is already there so that people, hopefully they want people to be go to sleep and say, when something happens to Trump, they want people to say, Oh,
[02:17:08.809 --> 02:17:09.149]  That's right.
[02:17:09.149 --> 02:17:20.974]  They're preconditioning us for his assassination or his incapacitation and they're admitting that's the plan on TV to embolden other coup plotters who have cold feet.
[02:17:22.406 --> 02:17:25.367]  Right, they want to get it out there to say, you're going to get away with it.
[02:17:25.367 --> 02:17:27.828]  Look at what they're letting James Comey get away with.
[02:17:27.828 --> 02:17:30.829]  Look what they've let Loretta Lynch and Hillary Clinton get away with.
[02:17:30.829 --> 02:17:32.829]  And they're using those as test cases.
[02:17:32.829 --> 02:17:35.230]  They're using those as putting that stuff out there.
[02:17:35.230 --> 02:17:37.631]  You think they know what they're leaking and what they're not leaking?
[02:17:37.631 --> 02:17:39.732]  Believe me, Alex, they know exactly what they're leaking.
[02:17:39.732 --> 02:17:41.372]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:17:41.372 --> 02:17:46.694]  They're doing all of this to show other people that you can break the law and get caught
[02:17:47.418 --> 02:17:48.719]  And you can get away with it.
[02:17:48.719 --> 02:17:50.380]  We control the DOJ.
[02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:51.821]  We control the prosecutors.
[02:17:51.821 --> 02:17:53.082]  We control the FBI.
[02:17:53.082 --> 02:17:54.864]  We can make it so that you'll be safe.
[02:17:54.864 --> 02:18:08.093]  This is a true rogue government preparing to decapitate the entire republic and complete our overthrow because they know culturally they're losing and the sleeping giant is coming back from the dead.
[02:18:08.093 --> 02:18:11.956]  That's why we're in a maximum danger because we're having maximum victory.
[02:18:11.956 --> 02:18:12.817]  Betsy Ross
[02:18:13.217 --> 02:18:20.441]  You're on the air dealing with Antifa with Jack Posobiec, who will be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:18:20.441 --> 02:18:23.002]  Oh, thank you Alex for taking my call.
[02:18:23.002 --> 02:18:23.882]  Can you hear me?
[02:18:23.882 --> 02:18:25.923]  Yes, I can.
[02:18:25.923 --> 02:18:26.864]  Okay, great.
[02:18:26.864 --> 02:18:32.306]  So, if this is an Infowar, we need a flag and a uniform.
[02:18:32.306 --> 02:18:39.690]  And I'm sending you, I want to send you a flag and a uniform.
[02:18:39.690 --> 02:18:41.471]  Oh, now I know why you're called Betsy Ross.
[02:18:43.007 --> 02:18:45.548]  That's right, that's right, you got it.
[02:18:45.548 --> 02:18:52.152]  So, can I, I want to send it to Tim Frugge, or I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right.
[02:18:52.152 --> 02:18:53.593]  Yeah, Frugge, it's a French name.
[02:18:53.593 --> 02:18:57.515]  Yeah, if you'll send it to Tim Frugge or whoever, I'd love to see it.
[02:18:57.515 --> 02:19:00.976]  Okay, and then should I send it registered mail?
[02:19:00.976 --> 02:19:02.957]  Uh, we, we, we, we get the packages.
[02:19:02.957 --> 02:19:05.599]  You say attention, uh, Tim Frugge or attention, Rob Dew.
[02:19:07.372 --> 02:19:08.092]  Okay, Rob do.
[02:19:08.092 --> 02:19:14.415]  Okay, and then also, I want to send a package to Paul Joseph Watson and his brother as well.
[02:19:14.415 --> 02:19:22.298]  Yeah, you know, Paul is in an undisclosed location in London, and their mail is so bad there, they tear into almost everything we send over there.
[02:19:22.298 --> 02:19:24.759]  But you can send stuff, Karen, to Paul here.
[02:19:24.759 --> 02:19:27.640]  He comes here a few times a year.
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:28.200]  Okay, great.
[02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:33.122]  And then, so this war has already been won.
[02:19:33.122 --> 02:19:34.663]  We are more than conquered.
[02:19:36.301 --> 02:19:39.943]  They are luciferian, as you pointed out before.
[02:19:39.943 --> 02:19:46.607]  So as long as we bow to Jesus, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, we are... No, no, you're right.
[02:19:46.607 --> 02:19:51.810]  And even if you were a sociologist, you would say that the anti-fascist Democrats are devil worshippers pedophiles.

[02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:52.992]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:22:52.992 --> 02:22:58.296]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:22:58.296 --> 02:22:59.898]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:22:59.898 --> 02:23:08.245]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:33.440]  We're good.
[02:24:01.281 --> 02:24:05.624]  It is the blitzkrieg of globalist anti-fascists.
[02:24:05.624 --> 02:24:08.865]  That America and the world is sick of globalism.
[02:24:08.865 --> 02:24:10.446]  We're taking your phone calls right now, Jack.
[02:24:10.446 --> 02:24:15.049]  The Summit will be back in the fourth hour with Mike Cernovich popping in.
[02:24:15.049 --> 02:24:19.191]  Hosted in studio by our very own Owen Schroyer.
[02:24:19.191 --> 02:24:23.854]  Who next Wednesday kicks off War Room.
[02:24:23.854 --> 02:24:27.536]  Big roundtable discussion, phone calls, breaking news, 3 p.m.
[02:24:29.841 --> 02:24:31.562]  Central to 6 p.m.
[02:24:31.562 --> 02:24:32.962]  Central.
[02:24:32.962 --> 02:24:44.206]  Going back to Jack Posobiec, we're going to take some calls here from Rock in Texas and others in just a moment, but I can sense it, I can see it, and I can see them responding.
[02:24:44.206 --> 02:24:47.508]  Desperation now with this hurricane bringing people together.
[02:24:47.508 --> 02:24:48.528]  How are they going to strike back?
[02:24:50.137 --> 02:24:54.899]  They're going to have to formulate some other kind of Charlottesville-like event, Alex.
[02:24:54.899 --> 02:25:06.684]  And as much as I hate to say it, as much as nobody wants to see that kind of violence, that kind of bigotry, they riled up some deep negative emotions that have been in the American psyche for a long time.
[02:25:06.684 --> 02:25:09.765]  And they had America at a fever pitch.
[02:25:09.765 --> 02:25:10.645]  Everyone could feel it.
[02:25:10.645 --> 02:25:16.888]  It was the wave almost pressed it over in terms of the anger, in terms of the hatred that they wanted to build up.
[02:25:16.888 --> 02:25:17.888]  But then this hurricane
[02:25:18.875 --> 02:25:19.956]  That happened.
[02:25:19.956 --> 02:25:30.681]  You know, it's as terrible as it was, you can see the hand of God in there because now people are coming together and the pictures that are coming out, it's people don't care what race somebody is.
[02:25:30.681 --> 02:25:32.102]  They don't care what background they are.
[02:25:32.102 --> 02:25:35.664]  They care that they're Americans, that they need help and they're going to help them.
[02:25:35.664 --> 02:25:37.345]  You're seeing law enforcement going to help.
[02:25:37.345 --> 02:25:39.025]  You're seeing military going to help.
[02:25:39.025 --> 02:25:42.387]  And this is what we do as Americans, as we do as a country.
[02:25:42.387 --> 02:25:43.788]  Louisiana with the floods last year.
[02:25:44.368 --> 02:25:47.030]  And everybody was asking, why isn't Hillary Clinton going?
[02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:49.831]  Trump went down himself with Pence, and they were handing out stuff.
[02:25:49.831 --> 02:25:57.835]  So the inherent goodness of America, and the inherent goodness, quite frankly, of humanity, is being shown through.
[02:25:57.835 --> 02:26:05.420]  And so that's cutting through and blocking- It's like the Star Trek episode where the alien feeds off the hate, but when you love, it dissipates its power.
[02:26:05.420 --> 02:26:09.822]  And like, again, like the sunshine to vampires, they are so upset by this.
[02:26:09.822 --> 02:26:11.583]  This is hurting them so bad.
[02:26:13.098 --> 02:26:20.283]  Yeah, because they know they're not going to be able to get the people to come out screaming Nazi and KKK and Russian at the Trump rallies.
[02:26:20.283 --> 02:26:23.885]  They're not going to be able to get them to come out and start screaming when they don't have that anger.
[02:26:23.885 --> 02:26:24.446]  That's all they have.
[02:26:24.446 --> 02:26:26.327]  It's the only play they have.
[02:26:26.327 --> 02:26:27.948]  It's the only play in their book.
[02:26:27.948 --> 02:26:31.470]  They go to it every single time they find themselves on the back end.
[02:26:31.470 --> 02:26:33.952]  They never come and say, let's have a discussion.
[02:26:33.952 --> 02:26:40.016]  Why isn't Barack Obama giving a joint statement with President Trump right now, denying violence and asking for people to come together?
[02:26:40.236 --> 02:26:41.557]  We used to do that, right?
[02:26:41.557 --> 02:26:50.222]  So why won't people... No, he's moved in down the street openly trying to have the overthrow of the president as Colonel Schaefer talks about in that video we just posted to InfoWars.com.
[02:26:50.222 --> 02:26:51.243]  Let's go to a phone call.
[02:26:51.243 --> 02:26:52.463]  The subject's amazing.
[02:26:52.463 --> 02:26:54.084]  So on target.
[02:26:54.084 --> 02:26:55.065]  Rock in Texas.
[02:26:55.065 --> 02:26:57.266]  You're on the air.
[02:26:57.266 --> 02:26:58.447]  Hello, Alex.
[02:26:58.447 --> 02:27:00.408]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:27:00.408 --> 02:27:08.193]  I'm in Dallas, Texas, and I just think it would be great to get that $150 billion back that Obama gave Iran
[02:27:09.449 --> 02:27:13.071]  I doubt that's possible.
[02:27:13.071 --> 02:27:30.300]  But the reason I'm calling is, I had a great idea last night, that uh, well actually it was a childhood idea that I had, that uh, Houston, that Hurricane Harvey brought back to me, and that's to have all the cars running on water.
[02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:35.742]  I used to draw pictures when I was a kid of cars that would run on water instead of gasoline.
[02:27:35.742 --> 02:27:38.704]  So I posted it on Facebook last night and they just erased it.
[02:27:39.738 --> 02:27:40.438]  I don't think so.
[02:28:00.991 --> 02:28:03.975]  Free thinking, interesting things are being deleted.
[02:28:03.975 --> 02:28:05.858]  Videos that they don't control are being deleted.
[02:28:05.858 --> 02:28:07.641]  Videos of cats are being deleted.
[02:28:07.641 --> 02:28:12.548]  They want PewDiePie deleted because he has 17, 18 billion views that are his.
[02:28:12.548 --> 02:28:14.470]  They don't control it.
[02:28:14.470 --> 02:28:17.474]  The Hollywood elite types, they don't want anybody that they don't control.
[02:28:18.624 --> 02:28:24.307]  And I saw, Alex, I know you saw the news as well last night, that it came out that some people were going and trying.
[02:28:24.307 --> 02:28:29.891]  So Zuckerberg was going out and posting all this stuff about the amnesty and he wants the dreamers to come in.
[02:28:29.891 --> 02:28:35.915]  And they were sending it to every single person on Facebook, both Zuckerberg and his wife, Mrs. Zuckerberg.
[02:28:35.915 --> 02:28:41.358]  And people were going and trying to block Mark Zuckerberg and saying, I don't want this spam, I don't want this, I want to block you.
[02:28:41.358 --> 02:28:42.979]  You can't actually block him.
[02:28:43.559 --> 02:28:44.820]  You can't block.
[02:28:44.820 --> 02:28:46.120]  And he's going to run for president.
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:55.985]  They say you can't run for president having your own TV show because it's undue influence, but he's going to have the biggest media empire in the world and force feed himself into our world.
[02:28:55.985 --> 02:28:59.866]  Yeah, it reminds me of MySpace when the guy Tom and it was you had to be friends with him.
[02:28:59.866 --> 02:29:01.007]  You had to be friends with him.
[02:29:01.007 --> 02:29:12.132]  And everybody thought that was kind of weird, you know, and everybody, I think as technology grew and as we became more and more invested in these companies and more and more of our lives were played out on the online sphere,
[02:29:12.632 --> 02:29:14.513]  And now they're doing it!
[02:29:14.513 --> 02:29:19.217]  Now they're using it to bring in Soviet-style or Chinese-style censorship.
[02:29:19.217 --> 02:29:19.597]  It's here.
[02:29:19.597 --> 02:29:20.137]  It's not coming.
[02:29:20.137 --> 02:29:20.477]  It's here.
[02:29:20.477 --> 02:29:21.358]  How do we fight back?
[02:29:21.358 --> 02:29:23.099]  That's in the fourth hour, only 30 minutes away.
[02:29:42.974 --> 02:29:45.722]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:58.038 --> 02:30:04.842]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[02:30:04.842 --> 02:30:07.404]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[02:30:07.404 --> 02:30:10.866]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[02:30:10.866 --> 02:30:13.068]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[02:30:13.068 --> 02:30:17.891]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality known concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[02:30:17.891 --> 02:30:20.773]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[02:30:20.773 --> 02:30:24.975]  It's never been the price it is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[02:30:27.877 --> 02:30:28.778]  Unprecedented.
[02:30:28.778 --> 02:30:29.998]  And it's cold-pressed.
[02:30:29.998 --> 02:30:31.939]  That's why Supermail is so different.
[02:30:31.939 --> 02:30:38.282]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science and these are other... What you sell, they... BuzzFeed said, it's like, it's already best-selling stuff.
[02:30:38.282 --> 02:30:40.343]  It's been certified as, you know, healthy and good forever.
[02:30:40.343 --> 02:30:41.543]  Why these aren't anything new?
[02:30:41.543 --> 02:30:45.805]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[02:30:45.805 --> 02:30:46.225]  Duh!
[02:30:46.225 --> 02:30:46.285]  Duh!
[02:30:53.129 --> 02:31:02.218]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:31:02.218 --> 02:31:10.626]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:10.626 --> 02:31:15.290]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:31:15.490 --> 02:31:22.273]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:31:22.273 --> 02:31:29.457]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:29.457 --> 02:31:36.480]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:40.822]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:31:40.942 --> 02:31:44.063]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:31:44.063 --> 02:31:53.425]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had
[02:32:09.898 --> 02:32:10.238]  I think?
[02:32:27.205 --> 02:32:28.146]  We're good to go.
[02:32:57.844 --> 02:33:00.965]  Waging War.
[02:33:00.965 --> 02:33:04.506]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:04.506 --> 02:33:09.607]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:09.607 --> 02:33:12.208]  Waging War on Corruption.
[02:33:12.208 --> 02:33:13.968]  And it's not just my transmission now.
[02:33:13.968 --> 02:33:15.409]  11 a.m.
[02:33:15.409 --> 02:33:17.209]  to 3 p.m.
[02:33:17.209 --> 02:33:21.130]  Now we have David Knight and the Real News.
[02:33:21.130 --> 02:33:23.391]  Yeah, the real voice of America is what we're talking about.
[02:33:23.391 --> 02:33:24.651]  That's what InfoWars is.
[02:33:26.061 --> 02:33:27.662]  That's 8 a.m.
[02:33:27.662 --> 02:33:29.323]  to 11 a.m.
[02:33:29.323 --> 02:33:36.389]  Central right before I go live and then when I go off each day starting next Wednesday because you got the holiday we need one more day to get ready next Wednesday.
[02:33:37.568 --> 02:33:48.832]  We're going to launch War Room with Owen Schroyer in here in studio as the maestro with a great symphony of amazing callers, research clips, and guests.
[02:33:48.832 --> 02:33:52.414]  Some of the other co-hosts are going to be Roger Stone, you name it.
[02:33:52.414 --> 02:33:57.395]  So is going to be part of it, Mike Cernovich, and many, many others.
[02:33:57.395 --> 02:33:59.036]  But this is going to be powerful.
[02:33:59.036 --> 02:34:02.937]  And then I intend to also add other transmissions.
[02:34:02.937 --> 02:34:06.619]  So we're going to end up going until midnight every night and kicking off at like 5 a.m.
[02:34:12.506 --> 02:34:26.371]  Now, before I go any further with our next guest, who's a victim of Antifa attacks, we're running, specifically, in the last month and a half, the biggest total sales that we've ever done.
[02:34:26.371 --> 02:34:28.332]  The most items for sale.
[02:34:29.403 --> 02:34:39.751]  But now those are over, we're doing targeted sales of the great herbal product, Super Mel Vitality, at 57% off.
[02:34:39.751 --> 02:34:44.294]  You can also get it 57% off as a combo with X2 Survival Shield.
[02:34:44.294 --> 02:34:49.999]  Again, we've never done it above 50%, but you can get X2 with it, 57%, because I want you to try the good halogen.
[02:34:49.999 --> 02:34:53.541]  I want you to experience, especially if you have an iodine deficiency, what it does.
[02:34:53.541 --> 02:34:57.765]  I mean, just mild IQ reductions from just a little bit.
[02:34:58.525 --> 02:35:00.806]  of iodine deficiency, but big ones.
[02:35:00.806 --> 02:35:03.088]  You're talking retardation, you name it.
[02:35:03.088 --> 02:35:10.392]  So just research for yourself what true clean iodine can do, bio, you know, true selenium can do from mustard seed and so much more.
[02:35:10.392 --> 02:35:17.456]  All those available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:35:17.456 --> 02:35:20.497]  Again, that's InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:35:20.497 --> 02:35:21.958]  And if you'll just commit
[02:35:25.683 --> 02:35:36.653]  And get great products like our Emrix Essentials line that we're also doing 50% off on, 25% off retail and 25% more on your first order when you sign up for auto ship.
[02:35:36.653 --> 02:35:37.914]  Cancel any time.
[02:35:37.914 --> 02:35:41.097]  And we also have caveman and strawberry and in chocolate.
[02:35:42.962 --> 02:35:43.843]  50% off.
[02:35:43.843 --> 02:35:51.426]  But the Supermail, the Selenium, and the X2 discounts are going to have to end on Monday because I'm getting very close to selling out of those.
[02:35:51.426 --> 02:35:56.448]  And quite frankly, I want to sell out of Caveman before we get more in in October.
[02:35:56.448 --> 02:35:59.050]  And I want you to experience how good it is.
[02:35:59.990 --> 02:36:09.573]  Now, again, that's two containers of Caveman, ladies and gentlemen, that you can get together, strawberry and chocolate, for $59.
[02:36:09.573 --> 02:36:14.074]  But that comes out, again, to $29 individually when you get them.
[02:36:14.074 --> 02:36:22.596]  Other major bone broth formulas that aren't even as strong, that don't have chaga mushroom or bee pollen or turmeric, supercharges all of it as antioxidants and more.
[02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:28.252]  Are $50 to $60 for bone broth formulas from chicken bone like ours is.
[02:36:28.252 --> 02:36:28.792]  That's the best.
[02:36:28.792 --> 02:36:34.595]  You know, grandma knew about chicken noodle soup, cooking the breast bone and stuff with the chicken in there, leaving it in.
[02:36:34.595 --> 02:36:36.195]  How good that was when you were sick.
[02:36:36.195 --> 02:36:37.696]  Well, this is beyond that.
[02:36:37.696 --> 02:36:44.158]  This is, I mean, I can't even do the equation on the equivalent of a bowl of chicken noodle soup of what one scoop of this is.
[02:36:44.158 --> 02:36:46.780]  And then all the other super foods that are in it.
[02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:49.741]  You get the ultimate paleo pack, both of them together.
[02:36:50.561 --> 02:36:53.928]  At 50% off or buy them individually at 50% off.
[02:36:53.928 --> 02:36:57.354]  I was looking at it earlier, I was like, that's not 50% off.
[02:36:57.354 --> 02:36:59.919]  It's less than that for a single one when we have it on sale.
[02:36:59.919 --> 02:37:01.322]  Hell, I think, oh, it's two of them.
[02:37:03.239 --> 02:37:07.283]  I was calling Tim up during the break going, it's not $59 regularly on sale.
[02:37:07.283 --> 02:37:08.544]  I guess at retail it would be.
[02:37:08.544 --> 02:37:10.085]  We always discount at some.
[02:37:10.085 --> 02:37:12.747]  He's like, no, no, that's two containers of it.
[02:37:12.747 --> 02:37:15.829]  So again, that's how you fund the operation, but it's a great product.
[02:37:15.829 --> 02:37:16.690]  Try it out today.
[02:37:16.690 --> 02:37:23.495]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support, whether it's spreading the articles or supporting our local affiliates.
[02:37:23.495 --> 02:37:26.037]  Without you, we couldn't be doing any of this.
[02:37:26.037 --> 02:37:28.719]  And I'll also go to Josh and Brett and others before this.
[02:37:31.223 --> 02:37:50.119]  Now, Arthur Schopper, out of all the brutal footage we've seen from the vicious Antifa, fascist, Nazi-like assaults, and I say that because the Nazis, the brown shirts and brown and black went out, the street gangs, and beat people up.
[02:37:50.119 --> 02:38:00.227]  Running people down, beating them up, hitting them in the head with clubs, attacking the police in a city the left already controls, for a Patriot prayer meeting.
[02:38:02.532 --> 02:38:09.275]  A patriot prayer meeting, and I guess because he had a shaved head like a lot of folks.
[02:38:09.275 --> 02:38:11.596]  I'm thinking about shaving mine if more of my hair falls out.
[02:38:11.596 --> 02:38:13.597]  You know, cops got the same haircut.
[02:38:13.597 --> 02:38:16.619]  They come up and they beat him, they attack him.
[02:38:17.970 --> 02:38:19.791]  I guess Floyd Mayweather had a shaved head.
[02:38:19.791 --> 02:38:21.531]  I guess he's a Nazi too.
[02:38:21.531 --> 02:38:24.672]  And so just spitting on him, spitting on him, spitting on him.
[02:38:24.672 --> 02:38:27.353]  But a lot more happened than just what we see on the tape.
[02:38:27.353 --> 02:38:44.518]  Them chasing him down, them hitting him, them tripping him, them knocking him to his feet, and then screaming obscenities and hissing with weird reporters, writing him down, looking at him like he's a demon, and taking photos, just getting off on this violent orgy of coming of age of the wimpy left.
[02:38:44.518 --> 02:38:45.738]  Because they believe they're Brad Pitt.
[02:38:46.732 --> 02:38:53.049]  You know, with Quentin Tarantino actually with a baseball bat about to beat the brains out of a Nazi general while they're 70 years ago.
[02:38:54.629 --> 02:38:56.050]  70 years ago.
[02:38:56.050 --> 02:38:59.272]  So, he joins us, Arthur Schopper.
[02:38:59.272 --> 02:39:02.735]  Arthur Schopper on YouTube, has a great channel.
[02:39:02.735 --> 02:39:08.699]  On Twitter, at Arthur C-S-C-H-A-P-E-R.
[02:39:08.699 --> 02:39:10.720]  So, Arthur Schopper.
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:14.423]  Arthur, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:39:14.423 --> 02:39:15.824]  Just amazing.
[02:39:15.824 --> 02:39:23.209]  Break down what it was like, what you witnessed, what we didn't see on all these videos of them just chasing men, women, children down and beating
[02:39:23.709 --> 02:39:24.709]  The daylights out of it.
[02:39:24.709 --> 02:39:26.490]  First, Pelosi celebrating.
[02:39:26.490 --> 02:39:27.450]  CBS celebrating.
[02:39:27.450 --> 02:39:28.991]  Hey, you're Nazis, you deserve it.
[02:39:28.991 --> 02:39:30.011]  But something happened.
[02:39:30.011 --> 02:39:36.713]  They've suddenly since then admit Trump's right and that Antifa is a very nasty group.
[02:39:36.713 --> 02:39:37.794]  Absolutely.
[02:39:37.794 --> 02:39:40.795]  Well, first of all, Alex, thank you again for having me on the show like this.
[02:39:40.795 --> 02:39:41.455]  It's great.
[02:39:41.455 --> 02:39:45.676]  I was able to be on David Knight's program and then to be here is excellent.
[02:39:45.676 --> 02:39:48.697]  It is so important that we get the full story out.
[02:39:48.697 --> 02:39:50.518]  I think the hat speaks for itself.
[02:39:50.518 --> 02:39:52.359]  I survived Berkeley, folks.
[02:39:52.359 --> 02:39:53.079]  I survived.
[02:39:53.559 --> 02:39:56.781]  I had gotten this as a gift following from late April.
[02:39:56.781 --> 02:40:01.403]  That was a huge success even though Ann Coulter had bailed on us and didn't show up.
[02:40:01.403 --> 02:40:04.384]  I refused to not go.
[02:40:04.384 --> 02:40:13.208]  I drove six hours to be up in the East Bay to see the Patriot Prairie events at Crissy Field in San Francisco and then to be at Berkeley and I refused to go away.
[02:40:13.208 --> 02:40:17.550]  I'm fed up with these left-wing groups and it's good, it's a good point you bring up the Nazis.
[02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:19.795]  They were left-wing groups.
[02:40:19.795 --> 02:40:21.278]  Antifa, left-wing.
[02:40:21.278 --> 02:40:22.902]  KKK, left-wing.
[02:40:22.902 --> 02:40:25.028]  Seeking to minimize any dis-
[02:40:26.374 --> 02:40:30.518]  To shut down freedom of speech and the individual spirit.
[02:40:30.518 --> 02:40:33.901]  And I refuse to be pushed around or bullied by them.
[02:40:33.901 --> 02:40:37.885]  Um, the day started out early September, excuse me, August 27th.
[02:40:37.885 --> 02:40:44.731]  I was there with Latinos for Trump, um, uh, leader of Margaritas, Joby Val from Brooklyn, Brooklyn, New York.
[02:40:44.731 --> 02:40:47.433]  Um, and with Marco's son, Michael, and we have another guy named Fred Garvey.
[02:40:47.433 --> 02:40:48.114]  He's from North Carolina.
[02:40:48.114 --> 02:40:48.354]  I don't
[02:41:05.164 --> 02:41:07.147]  We were walking up to the Martin Luther King Jr.
[02:41:07.147 --> 02:41:07.948]  Park.
[02:41:07.948 --> 02:41:09.891]  We actually met some Berkeley residents along the way.
[02:41:09.891 --> 02:41:11.153]  They even took our pictures.
[02:41:11.153 --> 02:41:12.715]  They were glad to see us there.
[02:41:12.715 --> 02:41:14.818]  They said, be safe and be civil.
[02:41:14.818 --> 02:41:16.180]  We always intend to be.
[02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:18.262]  We've never been disruptive or violent.
[02:41:19.585 --> 02:41:26.767]  In these events, I got to the park, I saw a whole bunch of police officers clad in riot gear.
[02:41:26.767 --> 02:41:32.429]  There was the city police and even the Alameda County, they had their sheriff's deputies there on site.
[02:41:32.429 --> 02:41:35.770]  So, it was like a well-fortressed area.
[02:41:35.770 --> 02:41:37.030]  They had bulwarks set up.
[02:41:37.490 --> 02:41:39.953]  Um, they even searched us to make sure that we didn't have any weapons.
[02:41:39.953 --> 02:41:42.336]  You know, this was a no weapons zone.
[02:41:42.336 --> 02:41:43.117]  No guns.
[02:41:43.117 --> 02:41:46.160]  This was a gun control zone, a mace control zone.
[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:48.363]  You know, of course, that never stops the bad guys.
[02:41:48.363 --> 02:41:49.384]  You know, how about that?
[02:41:49.384 --> 02:41:50.526]  Surprise!
[02:41:50.526 --> 02:41:52.128]  Um, one of our friends was Fred Garvey.
[02:41:52.128 --> 02:41:54.791]  He refused to go in because he insisted on being able to protect himself.
[02:41:55.231 --> 02:42:03.535]  So, Marco and I... That's another thing, you kind of walk into a trap, and I want to walk through everything that happened, but let's kind of skip to the end, and then back to the front again with one of the main victims of this.
[02:42:03.535 --> 02:42:08.778]  We only see a few shots, you being maced from behind, hit, you know, screamed at, chased.
[02:42:08.778 --> 02:42:16.662]  Then we see media all around videotaping, I guess halfway blocking the crowd, while you take a rest from the frothing crowds.
[02:42:16.662 --> 02:42:22.465]  How long did the attacks on you go, and what do we not see on the tape?
[02:42:23.982 --> 02:42:29.526]  Okay, so let's start with, it was 1-15, all the police have fled Martin Luther King Jr.
[02:42:29.526 --> 02:42:31.348]  Park, which was like crazy in itself.
[02:42:31.348 --> 02:42:32.869]  I'm like, why are you guys leaving?
[02:42:32.869 --> 02:42:35.251]  You know, we've got thugs that are still here.
[02:42:35.251 --> 02:42:41.156]  I got text messages and people were leaving me voicemails saying, Arthur, you've got to get out of the park, Antifa is coming.
[02:42:41.896 --> 02:42:46.620]  Um, and so I tried to get my team together and we started to go north towards Center Street.
[02:42:46.620 --> 02:42:49.543]  And then I see the police in riot gear, they're walking away.
[02:42:49.543 --> 02:42:54.847]  And I go, the best thing I can do is to stay near the police, but they're walking away and I gotta follow them.
[02:42:54.847 --> 02:42:59.611]  I turn around and I see two thugs in black shirts, black from top to bottom.
[02:42:59.611 --> 02:43:03.134]  They're walking towards me and then they start picking up the pace.
[02:43:03.134 --> 02:43:04.515]  So I start walking more quickly.
[02:43:05.991 --> 02:43:09.573]  And so, you know, it was a pretty scary time, let me tell you.
[02:43:09.573 --> 02:43:11.895]  Within a minute I felt the hat being taken off my head.
[02:43:11.895 --> 02:43:14.617]  I was walking north on Martin Luther King Jr.
[02:43:14.617 --> 02:43:15.878]  Street.
[02:43:15.878 --> 02:43:21.623]  Then they ripped the cape off of my back and my glasses flew off with it.
[02:43:21.623 --> 02:43:26.907]  And then I felt the pepper spray hitting me in the back of the head and then I got glitter bombed.
[02:43:26.907 --> 02:43:30.430]  So I felt a warmth along my skin, along my arms, the back of my head.
[02:43:30.430 --> 02:43:31.191]  It didn't
[02:43:31.932 --> 02:43:33.813]  Didn't get worse until later.
[02:43:33.813 --> 02:43:38.895]  And I see all of these, there were more press agents surrounding me than there were police.
[02:43:38.895 --> 02:43:40.676]  And then I see more thugs, they were running after me.
[02:43:40.676 --> 02:43:43.137]  So then I try to, there you see me there trying to cross the street.
[02:43:43.137 --> 02:43:48.180]  And then I thought of that one lady, the beautiful lady at the San Jose round.
[02:43:48.180 --> 02:43:50.041]  She was cornered, that was last year.
[02:43:50.041 --> 02:43:52.222]  And she got egg thrown at her and everything else.
[02:43:52.222 --> 02:43:58.485]  The best thing I could think of was to go to a building and sit there and make the press form a wall around me.
[02:43:58.485 --> 02:44:00.946]  And that's the way that I walked.
[02:44:02.445 --> 02:44:30.132]  there on the corner of your first martin luther king street and I sat down and rested I refused to run away and my running away I wasn't going to get to my car I was going to have these thugs finding out where I had parked I sat down I prayed I meditated my two favorite verses Isaiah 54 17 no weapon formed against me shall prosper every tongue that rises against me in judgment I condemn and 1 John 4 17 as Christ is so are we in this world there was a real
[02:44:31.153 --> 02:44:32.914]  I was actually in a way safe there.
[02:44:32.914 --> 02:44:37.419]  You know, you got all these press in front of me, shoving their cameras in my face, trying to record me.
[02:44:37.419 --> 02:44:38.920]  There were three Antifa thugs there.
[02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:39.941]  They were shouting at me.
[02:44:39.941 --> 02:44:42.884]  One guy was calling me all manner of evil, Nazi go home.
[02:44:42.884 --> 02:44:45.487]  But I stood there and I condemned white supremacy.
[02:44:45.487 --> 02:44:52.874]  And I added, I condemn the white supremacy of the Democratic Party and I demand that they renounce their history of racism.
[02:44:53.334 --> 02:44:54.976]  I continue to stump for my president.
[02:44:54.976 --> 02:44:57.299]  I support Trump because he's bringing jobs back.
[02:44:57.299 --> 02:44:57.920]  Wages are up.
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:44:58.781]  Jobs are up.
[02:44:58.781 --> 02:44:59.202]  Illegal.
[02:44:59.202 --> 02:45:02.466]  I continued to do what I had done in the park.
[02:45:02.466 --> 02:45:05.871]  I was not going to stop speaking freely.
[02:45:05.871 --> 02:45:11.298]  Within about two minutes, finally, a police officer from the Berkeley Police Department showed up.
[02:45:11.818 --> 02:45:17.561]  ...cleared the crowd, and I said, you know, I need help, I'm not being protected, I don't know why.
[02:45:17.561 --> 02:45:20.443]  He brought me up, he said, do you need medical attention?
[02:45:20.443 --> 02:45:22.064]  I said, no, at the time.
[02:45:22.064 --> 02:45:24.985]  And then he said, I will escort you to the sidewalk.
[02:45:24.985 --> 02:45:25.285]  Really?
[02:45:25.285 --> 02:45:27.847]  I needed to be escorted to my car.
[02:45:27.847 --> 02:45:31.349]  That's what I had gotten at Crissy Field yesterday from the federal police.
[02:45:31.349 --> 02:45:31.809]  Exactly.
[02:45:31.809 --> 02:45:35.091]  If you'd have been a leftist attack, they'd have had you on every TV show like you were God.
[02:45:35.091 --> 02:45:37.332]  And he knows these are Democrat-controlled cities.
[02:45:38.012 --> 02:45:48.784]  Like Charlottesville, like San Francisco where this is allowed, and then you have Berkeley where they're talking about cancelling all conservative events because the left's too violent giving in to them.
[02:45:48.784 --> 02:45:51.387]  So there are some defeats, but overall do you agree with me that
[02:45:52.369 --> 02:46:03.957]  This is a big victory, that Berkeley was the tipping point, because of you and so many others being beaten up, but taking it very Christ-like, Gandhi-like, Martin Luther King-like, not because you're wimps, but because you're so strong.
[02:46:03.957 --> 02:46:06.019]  Believe me, I don't think I could take it.
[02:46:06.019 --> 02:46:08.421]  And, I mean, I took that throwing coffee on me, but that was about it.
[02:46:08.421 --> 02:46:11.483]  I was ready after that to knock him upside the head if he hit me with the coffee mug, but...
[02:46:13.083 --> 02:46:15.224]  I've got to really speak to that.
[02:46:15.224 --> 02:46:19.888]  I've got contacts from black Trump supporters that said, Arthur, this was the Rosa Parks moment.
[02:46:19.888 --> 02:46:25.211]  And I say that right now, there are four and a half million Trump supporters in the state of California.
[02:46:25.211 --> 02:46:26.893]  We will not sit in the back of the bus.
[02:46:26.893 --> 02:46:29.094]  We will not be treated by second class citizens.
[02:46:29.094 --> 02:46:38.941]  And if we have to march on to every public venue in the state of California, and the left to shut down every damn park in the state of California, just as
[02:46:39.541 --> 02:46:44.623]  Black civil rights is refused to be bullied and refused to be treated by second-class citizens, which is not going to happen.
[02:46:44.623 --> 02:46:48.244]  We're not going to have a set of laws for Antifa and the left and a set of laws for the rest of us.
[02:46:48.244 --> 02:46:49.344]  We're just not going to have it.
[02:46:49.344 --> 02:46:50.485]  I want to wrap this up really quick.
[02:46:50.485 --> 02:46:52.125]  I didn't get to share this with David Knight.
[02:46:52.125 --> 02:46:57.787]  So a police officer offers to walk me to a sidewalk, but just God's perfect timing.
[02:46:57.787 --> 02:47:02.789]  And when I show up, when I got there, three of my friends with the red elephants, Vincent James is the head of it.
[02:47:02.789 --> 02:47:03.849]  They drove right there.
[02:47:03.849 --> 02:47:05.610]  They saw me and they said, Arthur, get in the car.
[02:47:06.170 --> 02:47:07.591]  And it was just perfect timing.
[02:47:07.591 --> 02:47:12.412]  There was even a journalist there who helped me to my car and said, because you stand with the Constitution, I stand with you.
[02:47:12.412 --> 02:47:14.113]  It didn't stop there though, Alex.
[02:47:14.113 --> 02:47:20.495]  After I got in the car and we drove out of the square, there I am right there telling the audience how I got pepper sprayed on the side.
[02:47:20.495 --> 02:47:23.136]  And I haven't even related how bad that was yet, mind you.
[02:47:23.136 --> 02:47:25.957]  So, we're driving the car and we have to get out of that square.
[02:47:26.397 --> 02:47:28.058]  But we found there were other drivers.
[02:47:28.058 --> 02:47:31.399]  They recognized us and they began to follow us.
[02:47:31.399 --> 02:47:35.240]  There was a car in front of us that backed up trying to break into us.
[02:47:35.240 --> 02:47:40.001]  We had to, um, Vincent James had to drive around the city, had to make sharp turns.
[02:47:40.001 --> 02:47:43.682]  So the left is in a road warrior craze right now.
[02:47:43.682 --> 02:47:46.143]  How bad is this going to get or will it help now that
[02:47:47.046 --> 02:47:50.547]  CNN, MSNBC are starting, they've been endorsing Antifa.
[02:47:50.547 --> 02:47:52.208]  At least they're not endorsing them now.
[02:47:52.208 --> 02:47:56.329]  I mean, shouldn't we call on CNN, MSNBC that have endorsed Antifa violence?
[02:47:56.329 --> 02:47:57.630]  Aren't they really liable for this?
[02:47:57.630 --> 02:48:05.433]  I mean, if I called for my listeners to go out and attack people and said, your enemies are Nazis, you know, if they're a Democrat, go, you know, knock them in the head with a hammer.
[02:48:05.433 --> 02:48:07.713]  I could go to prison for that, for racketeering.
[02:48:07.713 --> 02:48:09.094]  So, so, I mean, I really think they're liable.
[02:48:10.717 --> 02:48:11.838]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:48:11.838 --> 02:48:20.406]  I am urging Attorney General Jeff Sessions to initiate a RICO, racketeer-influenced, corrupt organization's investigation into Antifa.
[02:48:20.406 --> 02:48:26.552]  They'll find big money behind it, and we need to start knocking down heads and shutting off their money and putting them in jail.
[02:48:26.552 --> 02:48:27.473]  And I gotta wrap this up.
[02:48:27.473 --> 02:48:30.956]  What happened with the chasing, you talk about world rage, you got that right.
[02:48:30.956 --> 02:48:35.701]  We even went to a police station where there were a whole bunch of
[02:48:36.161 --> 02:48:38.342]  California Highway Patrol cruisers.
[02:48:38.342 --> 02:48:39.463]  We were trying to get safety.
[02:48:39.463 --> 02:48:42.244]  You'd think that you'd be able to find safety there.
[02:48:42.244 --> 02:48:44.065]  All these cars are sitting there going nowhere.
[02:48:44.065 --> 02:48:47.327]  And then a police officer comes out to us and starts harassing us.
[02:48:47.327 --> 02:48:50.629]  And when we're saying we're looking for safety, and then he says, don't give me that crap.
[02:48:50.629 --> 02:48:51.710]  You're lying to me.
[02:48:51.710 --> 02:48:52.750]  Get out of here.
[02:48:52.750 --> 02:48:55.792]  He was about ready to cite us for being there.
[02:48:56.272 --> 02:48:58.053]  This is the Berkeley Police Department.
[02:48:58.053 --> 02:49:00.214]  This is what the Highway Patrol is doing in that area.
[02:49:00.214 --> 02:49:01.554]  It was unreal.
[02:49:01.554 --> 02:49:03.095]  Well, that's what they do.
[02:49:03.095 --> 02:49:07.857]  They protect, you know, women being beaten up by 50 thugs with bite locks and almost killed.
[02:49:07.857 --> 02:49:11.878]  It is... I mean, leftist police are incredibly shameful creatures.
[02:49:11.878 --> 02:49:15.099]  Because even if you don't agree with somebody's politics, you have a duty to protect them.
[02:49:15.099 --> 02:49:16.600]  These are dishonorable people.
[02:49:18.940 --> 02:49:19.601]  I would agree.
[02:49:19.601 --> 02:49:26.149]  And we had to have the chief of that, the chief of police, Greenwood, who ordered the police to leave the park.
[02:49:26.149 --> 02:49:28.973]  He told them to stand down because he didn't want conflict there.
[02:49:28.973 --> 02:49:35.522]  And in Charlottesville, they ordered the police to march, the ne'er-do-wells mainly, through the group of other idiots.
[02:49:36.062 --> 02:49:53.369]  Triggering the whole deal, but here's your prayer meeting attacked, but that's what blew up in their face was it was multicultural, multi, you know, everything and it totally blew up in their face and you know, you're a modern guy in the Christ-like mold of what you've done and we want to commend you, Mr. Schopper, Arthur Schopper.

[02:50:06.488 --> 02:50:08.771]  Absolutely.
[02:50:08.771 --> 02:50:10.814]  I want to say I finally got home.
[02:50:10.814 --> 02:50:13.057]  The pepper spray, the burning was so intense.
[02:50:13.057 --> 02:50:15.040]  I had to stand under a shower for an hour.
[02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:15.921]  I could not rest.
[02:50:15.921 --> 02:50:17.022]  I couldn't defer the pain.
[02:50:17.022 --> 02:50:17.743]  It was so bad.
[02:50:17.743 --> 02:50:19.786]  I am so glad to finally get this out.
[02:50:19.786 --> 02:50:23.110]  The media was forced to acknowledge that Antifa is evil.
[02:50:24.712 --> 02:50:29.975]  I am proud that I was forced to make Nancy Pelosi condemn Antifa unequivocally.
[02:50:29.975 --> 02:50:30.655]  Her words.
[02:50:30.655 --> 02:50:32.676]  And even Paul Ryan had to finally get on board.
[02:50:32.676 --> 02:50:33.717]  That's right, that's right.
[02:50:33.717 --> 02:50:34.958]  You drew the evil out.
[02:50:34.958 --> 02:50:37.259]  Yeah, even the Republican establishment wouldn't condemn them.
[02:50:37.259 --> 02:50:40.040]  What a group of filthy, degenerate cowards.
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:45.503]  Most of these mainline Republicans are Republicans in name only, but we're forcing them out in the open.
[02:50:45.503 --> 02:50:47.304]  Alright, Josh and Brett, you're coming up.
[02:50:47.304 --> 02:50:49.125]  Thank you, Arthur, you're amazing.
[02:50:49.125 --> 02:50:50.326]  Look forward to speaking to him again.

[02:53:40.270 --> 02:53:40.610]  That's 833-474-4653.
[02:53:40.610 --> 02:53:42.471]  Or visit us on the web at gsi.gold.
[02:53:53.880 --> 02:53:58.642]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:53:58.642 --> 02:54:00.402]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:54:00.402 --> 02:54:02.043]  Well, so does he.
[02:54:02.043 --> 02:54:07.264]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:54:07.264 --> 02:54:09.565]  I'm gonna cover something that is absolutely
[02:54:19.889 --> 02:54:26.994]  It's critical to defeating the globalists and their main political theory outside of collectivist enslavement.
[02:54:26.994 --> 02:54:30.356]  This is actually a top-down system, the opposite of what they claim.
[02:54:30.356 --> 02:54:45.427]  If you want to have a revolution against these tyrants and restore the republic, you've got to understand their greatest tactic is they're so bold, they're so extreme, they're so over-the-top that you don't even want to respond to them and say what they are because it sounds crazy.
[02:54:46.169 --> 02:54:50.672]  It's like saying the UK's been, you know, basically discovered to be run by a bunch of pedophile rings.
[02:54:50.672 --> 02:54:56.136]  I said that 15 years ago, others said it before me, and then now it's mainstream news.
[02:54:56.136 --> 02:54:58.698]  Or that the highest levels of the Vatican are pedophile rings.
[02:54:58.698 --> 02:55:04.582]  Now it's mainstream news with the Deputy Pope basically indicted for running giant child kidnapping operations.
[02:55:04.582 --> 02:55:09.806]  Colonel Schaeffer's an amazing guy, broke so much of the Benghazi news, government working with Al-Qaeda news, you name it.
[02:55:10.998 --> 02:55:12.219]  Then we're going to your calls in a moment.
[02:55:12.219 --> 02:55:13.419]  He comes on yesterday.
[02:55:13.419 --> 02:55:17.601]  He goes, yeah, Phil Mudd of the CIA went on and said we're getting ready to kill the president.
[02:55:17.601 --> 02:55:18.882]  They're pushing COG.
[02:55:18.882 --> 02:55:20.442]  They're pushing his overthrow.
[02:55:20.442 --> 02:55:22.303]  They're pushing race riots.
[02:55:22.303 --> 02:55:25.344]  They're clearly gearing up to carry out a coup.
[02:55:25.344 --> 02:55:29.066]  So I tweeted the name of the video earlier from yesterday.
[02:55:29.066 --> 02:55:30.907]  We'll put my Twitter up on screen.
[02:55:30.907 --> 02:55:32.588]  Real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[02:55:33.368 --> 02:55:38.296]  Even if you haven't been on Twitter, it's an enemy platform, but we need you to go there and follow me at RealAlexJones.
[02:55:38.296 --> 02:55:39.638]  You can help get these out.
[02:55:39.638 --> 02:55:41.120]  We're gonna go to RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:43.544]  Or I can type it up, I guess.
[02:55:43.544 --> 02:55:44.786]  Punch this computer up.
[02:55:44.786 --> 02:55:45.447]  This computer's down.
[02:55:45.447 --> 02:55:46.669]  I can do it myself.
[02:55:46.669 --> 02:55:47.390]  And if you go there...
[02:55:48.345 --> 02:55:56.353]  You can see my Twitter, and you can see, uh, then if you go to Colonel Schaefer, I was just during the break out there, they got it up.
[02:55:56.353 --> 02:55:57.935]  You can see my tweet.
[02:55:57.935 --> 02:56:01.979]  Alex is a bit dramatic, but I stand by my assessment.
[02:56:01.979 --> 02:56:06.224]  Global enemies would be emboldened by a coup attempt on POTUS.
[02:56:08.049 --> 02:56:10.751]  Now, I get why Schaefer's not throwing me under the bus there.
[02:56:10.751 --> 02:56:16.836]  He knows psychological operations and he knows it sounds crazy to say there's a coup against the president.
[02:56:16.836 --> 02:56:17.997]  But they said it!
[02:56:17.997 --> 02:56:18.938]  They've been doing it!
[02:56:18.938 --> 02:56:19.979]  They've been writing it!
[02:56:19.979 --> 02:56:22.361]  They've been preparing it!
[02:56:22.361 --> 02:56:28.526]  So if I say Antifa are a bunch of devil worshippers running around screaming, hell, Satan, I mean, that's what they do.
[02:56:28.526 --> 02:56:30.207]  I have video.
[02:56:30.207 --> 02:56:32.349]  So Alex is a bit dramatic.
[02:56:32.349 --> 02:56:33.830]  Well, I guess it is a bit dramatic.
[02:56:33.830 --> 02:56:35.812]  It's over-the-top dramatic.
[02:56:37.489 --> 02:56:43.917]  So retweet that from real Alex Jones, retweet that from Tony Schaffer at T underscore spooky.
[02:56:43.917 --> 02:56:45.919]  Alex is a bit dramatic.
[02:56:45.919 --> 02:56:46.580]  Emergency.
[02:56:46.580 --> 02:56:53.608]  Colonel Schaffer confirms treasonous plan to assassinate Trump.
[02:56:53.608 --> 02:56:55.391]  He joins us to discuss the deep states.
[02:56:56.843 --> 02:57:00.767]  Movements against the president and their plot to execute an assassination.
[02:57:00.767 --> 02:57:11.199]  They've been saying quote former CIA deputy director We're preparing to kill him the deep state's gonna kill him And then you've got COG
[02:57:12.779 --> 02:57:22.543]  Saying, continue government, we're going to remove him, we're going to have new elections, Democrat-run Homeland Security, we'll overthrow everybody else that was elected, and the Democratic Party will become a permanent one-party state.
[02:57:22.543 --> 02:57:25.684]  They're the ones saying everyone that supports Trump's a Nazi.
[02:57:25.684 --> 02:57:27.365]  They're the ones calling for war.
[02:57:27.365 --> 02:57:29.426]  They're the ones saying go out and randomly kill cops.
[02:57:29.426 --> 02:57:33.667]  When cops get killed, they deserve to die because there's some bad cops.
[02:57:33.667 --> 02:57:35.508]  They're the ones saying it's racist to have a border.
[02:57:36.613 --> 02:57:37.814]  They're the globalists.
[02:57:37.814 --> 02:57:38.955]  They're the radicals.
[02:57:38.955 --> 02:57:44.561]  They're the ones that are over-the-top dramatic, and yes, extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.
[02:57:44.561 --> 02:57:51.627]  So, I appreciate Colonel Schaefer, and I understand what he's saying, because it is a bit dramatic, but he says, I stand by it.
[02:57:51.627 --> 02:57:53.509]  So he's really good at judo there.
[02:57:53.509 --> 02:57:58.534]  He understands that he agrees with me, but he's like, oh, it's a bit dramatic, but I stand by it.
[02:57:58.534 --> 02:57:59.655]  Oh, look, this is really dramatic.
[02:57:59.655 --> 02:58:00.836]  This is really shocking.
[02:58:00.836 --> 02:58:01.557]  You need to look at it.
[02:58:02.639 --> 02:58:07.585]  So we're going to go to break, come back with your calls and other guests are coming in, but I'm telling you, get that video.
[02:58:07.585 --> 02:58:10.408]  It's only got like 80,000 views or something.
[02:58:10.408 --> 02:58:12.230]  It was 60,000 an hour ago.
[02:58:12.230 --> 02:58:14.052]  It needs 10 million.
[02:58:14.052 --> 02:58:18.938]  It needs to be on Facebook and Twitter and your email list and talk show host need to be playing it.
[02:58:18.938 --> 02:58:20.280]  Forget what you think of Alex Jones.
[02:58:21.511 --> 02:58:24.395]  Just get the information out.
[02:58:24.395 --> 02:58:26.056]  InfoWars, folks.
[02:58:26.056 --> 02:58:31.162]  The videos up on InfoWars.com are retweeted from real Alex Jones right now.

[02:58:36.208 --> 02:58:37.410]  Ends on Monday.
[02:58:37.410 --> 02:58:39.132]  We need you to commit to support us.
[02:58:39.132 --> 02:58:39.913]  We're committed to you.
[02:58:43.815 --> 02:58:48.557]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.
[02:58:48.557 --> 02:58:53.000]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.

[02:59:04.205 --> 02:59:12.169]  The Prostagard formula does just that, with its mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants that help give your body total support.
[02:59:12.169 --> 02:59:21.534]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3, selenium, and copper.
[02:59:21.534 --> 02:59:31.799]  Prostagard is something that the men on the InfoWars crew take every day, and from our research, it's something that men should really be adding to their daily regimen in order to keep their body going at optimal levels.
[02:59:32.299 --> 02:59:33.581]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:59:56.078 --> 03:00:01.642]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:01.642 --> 03:00:05.844]  A poet's tale.
[03:00:05.844 --> 03:00:09.567]  A poet's tale how Poncho fell.
[03:00:09.567 --> 03:00:13.529]  He left his living in cheap hotels.
[03:00:13.529 --> 03:00:17.372]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[03:00:17.372 --> 03:00:21.374]  And so the story is we're told.
[03:00:21.374 --> 03:00:23.736]  Poncho needs your prayers, it's true.
[03:00:25.117 --> 03:00:29.021]  But save a few for lefty two.
[03:00:29.021 --> 03:00:32.624]  He only did what he had to do.
[03:00:32.624 --> 03:00:34.065]  Here's Merle Haggard.
[03:00:34.065 --> 03:00:36.868]  And now... And now, Stroho.
[03:00:42.125 --> 03:00:56.979]  Here's BBC, I got this on Paul's Twitter at Prison Planet, because all over BBC programs now, they're going to like Roman history, British history, you name it, Russian history, and showing about a third of the people, to half the people being black.
[03:00:56.979 --> 03:01:02.404]  I'm not against any black people, but don't show me a history about the Zulus, or something, and then...
[03:01:03.871 --> 03:01:10.214]  You know, sit there and show me a bunch of white dudes, you know, in the Zulu tribe.
[03:01:10.214 --> 03:01:13.695]  Or a show about Japanese, you know, and it's like a bunch of black guys or white guys.
[03:01:13.695 --> 03:01:16.476]  I mean, this is just mental illness.
[03:01:16.476 --> 03:01:22.919]  It shows Victorian England, there's like Asians, black people everywhere.
[03:01:22.919 --> 03:01:26.780]  They're showing cartoons where the Romans are black.
[03:01:26.780 --> 03:01:28.521]  Hell, show...
[03:01:30.814 --> 03:01:33.436]  Neil Armstrong, Chuck Yeager, make him black.
[03:01:33.436 --> 03:01:39.340]  I mean, it's like, we can't have whites having any success, because that's racist.
[03:01:39.340 --> 03:01:41.261]  It's mental illness!
[03:01:41.261 --> 03:01:45.104]  It's ridiculous!
[03:01:45.104 --> 03:01:48.447]  Make a movie about Aztec pyramid builders, have some black dudes up there.
[03:01:48.447 --> 03:01:56.132]  It'd be like saying, don't show Obama as black, show him as a white guy, because you want to, it just gets weird.
[03:01:56.132 --> 03:01:57.153]  And it's getting worse.
[03:01:57.153 --> 03:01:58.354]  Josh and then Bretta.
[03:01:59.591 --> 03:02:01.074]  Actually, Breda's been on the line.
[03:02:01.074 --> 03:02:02.857]  Breda, thanks for holding from Florida.
[03:02:02.857 --> 03:02:07.084]  You're on the air.
[03:02:07.084 --> 03:02:09.949]  Hey Alex, and all the Info Wars, can you hear me?
[03:02:09.949 --> 03:02:11.111]  Yes sir, I can!
[03:02:11.111 --> 03:02:11.171]  Woo!
[03:02:14.961 --> 03:02:16.282]  Thank God!
[03:02:16.282 --> 03:02:30.254]  Literally, I have waited, and I'm a very patient man, and I'm a man of God, and I'm a man of Christ, and I believe that we can look at how Christ has handled
[03:02:32.607 --> 03:02:38.488]  Uh, insanity and people that have completely lost their mind.
[03:02:38.488 --> 03:02:42.309]  When he says, you know, he says, come out of them, Satan, we are legion.
[03:02:42.309 --> 03:02:45.770]  And then the pigs all run off the edge of the cliff.
[03:02:45.770 --> 03:02:46.630]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:02:46.630 --> 03:02:54.652]  I'm convinced if Christ went to an antifa event and said legion out of them, they would all run screaming off the cliff.
[03:02:54.652 --> 03:03:01.574]  These people that, and we need to forget, honestly, we need to, we need to try to,
[03:03:02.305 --> 03:03:06.668]  Leave religion and and the politics out of this.
[03:03:06.668 --> 03:03:11.372]  I think these people are really trying to look and I'm talking about Antifa.
[03:03:11.372 --> 03:03:12.953]  No, they all left.
[03:03:12.953 --> 03:03:17.637]  They're really they're really seeking for answers and the real answers.
[03:03:19.578 --> 03:03:40.268]  I mean, it's proven fact that people, you know, the truth hurts, but when Jesus went into the temples and kicked over the, you know, the table, and I mean, it's all a story that aligns with what is happening now, and these people really
[03:03:41.028 --> 03:03:46.452]  You know, as much as, you know, whatever, left or right, it doesn't matter.
[03:03:46.452 --> 03:03:49.234]  Most of them are atheists and Zionists.
[03:03:49.234 --> 03:03:55.418]  You know, they believe that they're a god and they're part of this huge big godhead and all that.
[03:03:55.418 --> 03:03:57.519]  I'm telling you, these people are there.
[03:03:57.519 --> 03:03:59.300]  That's the point they're at.
[03:03:59.300 --> 03:04:05.625]  They just need the real information and they need to, you know... Well, I'll tell this.
[03:04:05.625 --> 03:04:07.025]  I mean, I'll tell the globalists this.
[03:04:07.025 --> 03:04:08.967]  If they're looking for enlightenment and understanding,
[03:04:13.990 --> 03:04:15.411]  The way of liberty is the way to go.
[03:04:15.411 --> 03:04:22.095]  What they're bringing in, this authoritarian system, is just a personal, delusional power trip that's a lie.
[03:04:22.095 --> 03:04:24.637]  And so, I would have to agree with you, Brett.
[03:04:24.637 --> 03:04:25.177]  Thank you.
[03:04:25.177 --> 03:04:27.058]  Josh, I'm gonna ride shotgun.
[03:04:27.058 --> 03:04:27.579]  Let's bring in...
[03:04:28.519 --> 03:04:32.804]  Owen Troyer right now to co-host with me with Jack Posobiec.
[03:04:32.804 --> 03:04:38.910]  Mike Cernovich is going to be popping in and a lot more as we continue with your phone calls straight ahead 800-259-9231.
[03:04:38.910 --> 03:04:44.436]  We're now into hour number four.
[03:04:44.436 --> 03:04:45.077]  Stay with us.
[03:04:45.077 --> 03:04:47.980]  By the way, Owen launches his new show next Wednesday at 3 p.m.
[03:04:49.956 --> 03:04:52.057]  Joe Vicks here with InfoWars.com.
[03:04:52.057 --> 03:04:54.378]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[03:04:54.378 --> 03:04:55.438]  Why we have them.
[03:04:55.438 --> 03:04:58.819]  Why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them.
[03:04:58.819 --> 03:05:04.321]  And why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[03:05:04.321 --> 03:05:11.243]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[03:05:11.343 --> 03:05:22.088]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[03:05:22.088 --> 03:05:25.730]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[03:05:27.631 --> 03:05:34.797]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[03:05:34.797 --> 03:05:37.440]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[03:05:37.440 --> 03:05:40.302]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth.
[03:05:40.302 --> 03:05:46.888]  It protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[03:05:46.888 --> 03:05:49.410]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston.
[03:05:49.850 --> 03:05:55.312]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:05:55.312 --> 03:05:57.413]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:05:57.413 --> 03:06:02.695]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:06:02.695 --> 03:06:06.396]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that

[03:08:07.184 --> 03:08:08.647]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:08:16.613 --> 03:08:26.617]  All right, Alex Jones here, overlapping into the fourth hour, which is always a great, not even after show, but just one of the latest is breaking with a whole roundtable discussion, a prototype.
[03:08:26.617 --> 03:08:32.780]  All the new broadcasts we're launching with David Knight now, his first week complete, doing a great job, two weeks now.
[03:08:32.780 --> 03:08:36.121]  And that is, of course, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[03:08:36.121 --> 03:08:37.262]  until I come on at 11 a.m.
[03:08:37.262 --> 03:08:37.682]  Central.
[03:08:37.682 --> 03:08:41.924]  Now, starting next Wednesday, we're going to kick off your inaugural transmission.
[03:08:42.944 --> 03:08:46.886]  Oh, and it's going to be a big roundtable discussion, a very powerful 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:08:46.886 --> 03:08:49.768]  Central, and then just more is going to get added.
[03:08:49.768 --> 03:08:51.709]  We've got a few more callers I'm going to hit.
[03:08:51.709 --> 03:08:56.972]  Jack Posobiec is here with us, but a lot of good news is happening.
[03:08:56.972 --> 03:09:01.054]  Bad news for folks down at the hurricane, gas shortages, some dead folks.
[03:09:01.054 --> 03:09:01.894]  The death toll's up like 15 now.
[03:09:03.726 --> 03:09:06.587]  But, to see folks come together was really great.
[03:09:06.587 --> 03:09:19.133]  It just flies in the face of the media and Hollywood and this total division they've been pushing to put all the minorities under their globalist control and then to submit whites to globalist control as well.
[03:09:19.133 --> 03:09:20.013]  That's blowing up.
[03:09:20.013 --> 03:09:26.516]  But, Putin's come out and warns North Korea's situation on the verge of large-scale conflict, close quote.
[03:09:26.516 --> 03:09:28.137]  That is really big news.
[03:09:28.137 --> 03:09:32.599]  So I want to ask Jack Pesso before we go to these calls, Anno and Schroer, as The Wolf says in
[03:09:34.258 --> 03:09:34.618]  I don't know.
[03:09:56.098 --> 03:09:58.259]  Owen, what are you most concerned about?
[03:09:58.259 --> 03:09:59.600]  It's funny that you mention that.
[03:09:59.600 --> 03:10:03.562]  I actually think, Alex, that right now, obviously the political left is getting more violent.
[03:10:03.562 --> 03:10:06.664]  The FBI, Department of Homeland Security is starting to step in there.
[03:10:06.664 --> 03:10:14.448]  The coup against President Trump that we've been talking about, you've been talking about since he was elected, more people are pointing attention, calling attention to that.
[03:10:14.608 --> 03:10:15.329]  Well, we better.
[03:10:15.329 --> 03:10:19.453]  They're on TV saying they're getting ready to do it, and we're not supposed to be kooky and say they're saying it.
[03:10:19.453 --> 03:10:20.914]  Of course it's extreme and crazy.
[03:10:20.914 --> 03:10:21.795]  They're saying it.
[03:10:21.795 --> 03:10:22.575]  I'm not saying it.
[03:10:22.575 --> 03:10:23.296]  They're saying it.
[03:10:23.296 --> 03:10:24.577]  I gotta be honest with you, though, Alex.
[03:10:24.577 --> 03:10:33.125]  With all of this madness going on, I think the big story, actually, that's gonna end up being here in the next two weeks, I think Hurricane Irma is going to devastate America again.
[03:10:33.125 --> 03:10:39.311]  Yeah, if you show the tracks, most of them go across southern Florida, right into the Gulf of the Hot Water, and right into Louisiana or Texas again.
[03:10:39.411 --> 03:10:45.416]  So there is a chance that Hurricane Irma can come up and hit the exact same spot that Hurricane Harvey hit.
[03:10:45.416 --> 03:10:51.061]  Now it could go up the east coast higher, it could end up staying south, but right now there is a chance.
[03:10:51.061 --> 03:10:58.208]  And so with all this madness going on, I think what we're going to see again, just like we saw with Hurricane Harvey, America's going to come together!
[03:10:58.208 --> 03:11:00.270]  America's going to show its true colors!
[03:11:00.270 --> 03:11:01.451]  All races, all colors!
[03:11:01.451 --> 03:11:02.431]  Because remember what they did?
[03:11:03.152 --> 03:11:05.214]  With Bush, and he kind of let them manipulate him.
[03:11:05.214 --> 03:11:07.857]  And then with Obama, he would just ignore the hurricanes because he didn't want unity.
[03:11:07.857 --> 03:11:08.818]  That's why he wouldn't go do it.
[03:11:08.818 --> 03:11:13.704]  But with Trump, I mean, with Bush, they just attacked it and then the Fed sabotaged it.
[03:11:13.704 --> 03:11:17.047]  But then with Obama, he just wouldn't even show up because he didn't want to have the unity.
[03:11:17.047 --> 03:11:19.370]  And now we know they're so scared of the unity.
[03:11:20.236 --> 03:11:23.559]  And it shows, and you have the powerful images, the powerful videos.
[03:11:23.559 --> 03:11:24.900]  Guys, show Irma's track.
[03:11:24.900 --> 03:11:30.685]  Just go to the National NOAA Weather Oceanographic Bill, and show possible tracks.
[03:11:30.685 --> 03:11:33.888]  That's where it currently is, and where it's going to be.
[03:11:33.888 --> 03:11:39.272]  But let's show, just search engine at NOAA, it's possible tracks.
[03:11:39.272 --> 03:11:44.177]  There you go, a lot of the tracks go up the East Coast, which we hope it does, up into the middle of the North Atlantic.
[03:11:44.737 --> 03:11:49.818]  But a lot of them go right into Florida, right into South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia.
[03:11:49.818 --> 03:11:55.099]  But a lot of the tracks have it going right into Mississippi, Louisiana, or possibly into Texas again.
[03:11:55.099 --> 03:11:56.320]  So what happens?
[03:11:56.320 --> 03:12:01.801]  You have leftist and Trump haters complain Donald Trump didn't give enough money to Hurricane Harvey.
[03:12:01.801 --> 03:12:07.322]  He donates a million dollars of his personal money to Hurricane Harvey and people go online on Twitter and they complain.
[03:12:07.802 --> 03:12:08.982]  Oh, why didn't he give more?
[03:12:08.982 --> 03:12:09.642]  He could have gotten more.
[03:12:09.642 --> 03:12:14.884]  Even though Liberals are nine times more likely, according to major Canadian and British studies, to not give money.
[03:12:14.884 --> 03:12:16.484]  It's crazy, the studies found the same numbers.
[03:12:16.484 --> 03:12:19.345]  They give no money to Harvey, and then you have CNN who goes... No, no, no.
[03:12:19.345 --> 03:12:26.806]  Linda Sorcerer gets the money and directs it to her Liberal groups, with none of it to aid.
[03:12:26.806 --> 03:12:30.387]  I can't even... What's worse than big churches not opening their doors?
[03:12:31.377 --> 03:12:33.339]  Well, it's actually taking money and not giving it to them.
[03:12:33.339 --> 03:12:37.682]  That's why I didn't even do aid stuff, because I don't even know how to get the money, and then get it to the right group.
[03:12:37.682 --> 03:12:38.523]  I don't even want to touch it.
[03:12:38.523 --> 03:12:40.104]  It has to be direct.
[03:12:40.104 --> 03:12:44.128]  The direct aid is usually the best to go, but then you have... Yeah, we sent trucks down, we sent crew down.
[03:12:44.128 --> 03:12:45.609]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:12:45.609 --> 03:12:46.690]  So what does CNN do?
[03:12:46.690 --> 03:12:52.154]  CNN goes out, they stick a microphone in this woman who's hungry, she's got her kid, they're wet, and what happens?
[03:12:52.154 --> 03:12:54.316]  CNN gets completely rebuked!
[03:12:54.316 --> 03:12:56.378]  This woman's like, why do you have a camera in my face?
[03:12:56.378 --> 03:12:57.379]  Get that microphone out of my face!
[03:12:57.379 --> 03:12:59.660]  She's in line, freezing, wanting food after days.
[03:13:00.501 --> 03:13:13.626]  So, unfortunately, Alex, even though we've got all of this madness, all this political madness, all this chaos, the constant news cycle, every day it's something, we're trying to keep our finger on the pulse, I think, again, God is going to remind us that we are still ants on his planet.
[03:13:13.626 --> 03:13:17.508]  Well, Martin Luther King exactly said, the universe bends towards justice.
[03:13:17.508 --> 03:13:20.249]  Jack Posobiec, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[03:13:20.249 --> 03:13:24.671]  But since we have so much positive news, we should probably look at where do you think the enemy is going to strike back?
[03:13:26.084 --> 03:13:29.005]  Well, Alex, they're going to continue with this deep state stuff.
[03:13:29.005 --> 03:13:31.425]  The Comey is their endgame.
[03:13:31.425 --> 03:13:39.527]  They're going to have Comey bring out some completely trumped up charges, pun not intended, but there you go, on President Trump.
[03:13:39.527 --> 03:13:41.647]  They're going to use this to go after him.
[03:13:41.647 --> 03:13:47.268]  They're going to be shaping our intelligence assessments and they're using that to filter the information that's getting to Trump.
[03:13:47.268 --> 03:13:54.550]  So that's why one of the big stories that I was breaking today on my blog that I put out is that there is a new group, believe it or not,
[03:13:54.970 --> 03:14:03.995]  Of veterans, of intelligence agents, of law enforcement agents, people that were essentially members of the deep state, but these were white hats, not black hats.
[03:14:03.995 --> 03:14:09.879]  They were patriots that formed together that said, we were going after our enemy, we're going after the terrorists.
[03:14:09.879 --> 03:14:11.860]  2015, the New York Times reported this stuff.
[03:14:11.860 --> 03:14:15.402]  50 of them spoke forward and said Obama is shaping and distorting
[03:14:18.384 --> 03:14:24.709]  We already saw the real deep state five years ago refuse to be Al Qaeda, ISIS's air force, and make a deal with Russia to take them out.
[03:14:24.709 --> 03:14:30.294]  So when they say there's Russian collusion, the real collusion is with our military and the Russians taking out radical jihadis.
[03:14:32.296 --> 03:14:32.856]  Exactly.
[03:14:32.856 --> 03:14:37.057]  And so this new task force is stepping forward and saying, enough is enough.
[03:14:37.057 --> 03:14:39.538]  We see how you're trying to shape the assessment.
[03:14:39.538 --> 03:14:44.899]  We see how you're trying to shape the information that's getting to President Trump, that's getting to these senior leaders.
[03:14:44.899 --> 03:14:47.540]  And then Trump goes and gives a speech and people are saying, what's he talking about?
[03:14:47.540 --> 03:14:49.460]  Because he's not getting the real intel.
[03:14:49.460 --> 03:14:50.721]  So they're working forward.
[03:14:50.721 --> 03:14:55.542]  And I was, I'm not able to give out any specific names just yet, but in the coming weeks, we're going to have more on this.
[03:14:55.922 --> 03:14:57.624]  That's right, they're trying to still protect Al Qaeda.
[03:15:16.604 --> 03:15:40.197]  Yeah, this has been going on, perfect example, going all the way back to the Clinton years when they were trying to prop up Al-Qaeda, and this goes back to the CIA's original support for Al-Qaeda against the Soviet Union in the 1970s and the early 1980s when they were in Afghanistan, the Mujahideen, the fact that CIA and agency assets were fully behind that, the fact that Bin Laden essentially was funded by the same organization.
[03:15:40.197 --> 03:15:42.178]  Now these are people that are patriots.
[03:15:44.179 --> 03:15:47.540]  People like Colonel Schaefer who did it day one when they wouldn't let him kill him.
[03:15:47.540 --> 03:15:51.682]  Now, Schaefer was on me yesterday and he said, look, Alex is being a bit dramatic, but he stands by it.
[03:15:51.682 --> 03:15:55.163]  They try to kill Trump, our enemies worldwide will move against us.
[03:15:55.163 --> 03:15:56.704]  The deep state needs to think about that.
[03:15:56.704 --> 03:16:00.065]  But most of the deep state is just patriots against what's happening.
[03:16:00.065 --> 03:16:01.526]  People need to understand that.
[03:16:01.526 --> 03:16:08.829]  But we'll put Colonel Schaefer's tweet up, where he retweeted where I said, emergency, Colonel Schaefer confirms treasonous plan to assassinate Trump.
[03:16:08.829 --> 03:16:09.489]  Well, he did agree.
[03:16:10.009 --> 03:16:11.070]  On the video, there's a plan.
[03:16:11.070 --> 03:16:12.752]  Hell, they're on TV saying it.
[03:16:12.752 --> 03:16:14.814]  I'm not the radical saying it.
[03:16:14.814 --> 03:16:20.639]  It sounds radical when I report it, but I'm simply reporting that reality is stranger than fiction, Jack.
[03:16:20.639 --> 03:16:25.123]  So we've got to point out that they're trying to organize the coup in public as a confidence game.
[03:16:25.123 --> 03:16:26.825]  Why do you think they're being so bold?
[03:16:28.647 --> 03:16:32.590]  Alex, they're being so bold because they live in a bubble.
[03:16:32.590 --> 03:16:34.151]  They live in an information bubble.
[03:16:34.151 --> 03:16:37.713]  And this is actually something that we can use to our advantage.
[03:16:37.713 --> 03:16:47.679]  Because in their information bubble, they still think that they have the power and influence over the American people, over the narrative, and over the information environment that they used to enjoy.
[03:16:47.679 --> 03:16:54.764]  So they're narcissists power trip yes-men that were given their power by other kleptocrats, and they're actually a bunch of delusional losers.
[03:16:54.764 --> 03:16:55.004]  Yes.
[03:16:56.249 --> 03:16:58.931]  They think that if they say it's so, they can say it's so.
[03:16:58.931 --> 03:17:05.295]  They think if they say, well Trump is evil, we have to get rid of Trump, we have to get rid of Trump, that people are just going to nod their heads and go along with it.
[03:17:05.295 --> 03:17:09.038]  Dan Rather, exactly, as you pointed out earlier, the crazy stuff that he's been saying.
[03:17:09.038 --> 03:17:15.402]  This is a guy who's been convicted of, not convicted, you know, uh- Found guilty of putting out fake info.
[03:17:15.919 --> 03:17:20.401]  Yeah, the fake info, the fake documents that he put out during the Bush time, right before the election.
[03:17:20.401 --> 03:17:22.301]  Yeah, he produced fake documents.
[03:17:22.301 --> 03:17:25.263]  Let's go ahead and hear from Mr. Prunes.
[03:17:25.263 --> 03:17:27.023]  Talk about a guy full of prunes.
[03:17:27.023 --> 03:17:29.404]  Dan Rather saying Trump's scared.
[03:17:29.404 --> 03:17:34.186]  Again, trying to prop up confidence in the faltering Democratic Party that they're winning.
[03:17:34.186 --> 03:17:36.787]  Tokyo arose, 1945.
[03:17:36.787 --> 03:17:38.668]  The Japanese have defeated America.
[03:17:38.668 --> 03:17:41.689]  They dropped A-bombs on Los Angeles and on D.C.
[03:17:41.689 --> 03:17:43.549]  The Japanese won World War II.
[03:17:43.549 --> 03:17:44.490]  Dan Rather reports.
[03:17:44.490 --> 03:17:44.850]  Here it is.
[03:17:45.310 --> 03:17:47.190]  Donald Trump is afraid.
[03:17:47.190 --> 03:17:51.031]  He's trying to exude power and strength.
[03:17:51.031 --> 03:17:56.133]  He's afraid of something that Mueller and the prosecutors are going to find out.
[03:17:56.133 --> 03:18:03.454]  And what you're seeing, time after time, is a president who is, within himself, seized with fear.
[03:18:03.454 --> 03:18:08.275]  And that's going to be, you know, a political hurricane is out there to seize him.
[03:18:08.275 --> 03:18:10.476]  We'll call it Hurricane Vladimir, if you will.
[03:18:11.502 --> 03:18:14.745]  Now he's got hurricane Alzheimer's, Dan Rather does.
[03:18:14.745 --> 03:18:21.109]  Again, Mueller says, oh, he might have a letter that Trump was going to send to Comey, but didn't, like it's some secret dirt.
[03:18:21.109 --> 03:18:25.913]  Oh, a letter that his lawyer said don't send, saying you're full of crap on Russia, drop it.
[03:18:25.913 --> 03:18:28.835]  The president's allowed to tell the FBI or director to do that.
[03:18:28.835 --> 03:18:29.576]  He's the president.
[03:18:29.576 --> 03:18:32.858]  If you don't like it, impeach him or don't vote for him again.
[03:18:32.858 --> 03:18:34.540]  They're acting like the president
[03:18:35.120 --> 03:18:37.100]  Oh my gosh, he met with Russians at the White House!
[03:18:37.100 --> 03:18:37.561]  It's illegal!
[03:18:37.561 --> 03:18:38.221]  Oh my God!
[03:18:38.221 --> 03:18:40.841]  He waved at Putin across the table at a G20!
[03:18:40.841 --> 03:18:44.182]  He even drank a glass of ice water!
[03:18:44.182 --> 03:18:47.103]  Listen, they saw Trump have a hamburger!
[03:18:47.103 --> 03:18:55.924]  Meanwhile, though, on the other side of the aisle, it turns out that Comey was actually colluding with Hillary Clinton and dropped that investigation before he properly did it.
[03:18:55.924 --> 03:18:58.665]  Oh, but there's no special counsel for that, then you've got... Right, right, right!
[03:18:58.985 --> 03:19:01.966]  Maxine Waters saying, we've got our Mueller!
[03:19:01.966 --> 03:19:03.286]  He's gonna get him!
[03:19:03.286 --> 03:19:05.647]  I mean, she's saying he's their lapdog!
[03:19:05.647 --> 03:19:09.468]  But you know what the truth is about Dan Rather's comments that he just made, Alex?
[03:19:09.468 --> 03:19:11.309]  They are the ones that are scared.
[03:19:11.309 --> 03:19:13.930]  It's the spirit cookers that are the ones that are scared.
[03:19:13.930 --> 03:19:18.571]  It's the Hillary- And let's say it, they're a bunch of weirdo wimps that have been looking for power their whole lives.
[03:19:19.091 --> 03:19:20.513]  And they're about to run out.
[03:19:20.513 --> 03:19:21.915]  They're about to run out of power.
[03:19:21.915 --> 03:19:23.516]  And that's why they're scared, Alex.
[03:19:23.516 --> 03:19:25.118]  That's why they're con-gaming going.
[03:19:25.118 --> 03:19:26.159]  We're confident.
[03:19:26.159 --> 03:19:26.780]  We're winning.
[03:19:26.780 --> 03:19:28.282]  We're going to get rid of Trump and Pence.
[03:19:28.282 --> 03:19:30.625]  We're going to get rid of all the red states.
[03:19:30.625 --> 03:19:32.126]  We're going to arrest them all.
[03:19:32.126 --> 03:19:33.328]  They're all Nazis.
[03:19:33.328 --> 03:19:34.169]  We're going to kill them.
[03:19:35.799 --> 03:19:41.622]  They're getting hit right now by Hurricane Trump in Washington, D.C.
[03:19:41.622 --> 03:19:47.825]  And what you're seeing on the political side is the Trump hurricane is coming at them and is completely uprooting all of this.
[03:19:47.825 --> 03:19:51.447]  You know, Scott Adams, who's somebody I listen to a lot, he said, Trump is a builder.
[03:19:51.447 --> 03:19:54.088]  And right now, we're in the demolition phase.
[03:19:54.088 --> 03:19:55.309]  And that's phase one.
[03:19:55.309 --> 03:19:58.571]  Phase one of any construction project is you've got to get rid of the demolition phase.
[03:19:58.571 --> 03:20:01.352]  And by the way, just getting rid of the regulations that were only meant to shut us down, 3.0
[03:20:03.894 --> 03:20:04.975]  They never do that.
[03:20:04.975 --> 03:20:07.158]  He did it in seven months, untold.
[03:20:07.158 --> 03:20:09.001]  I'm not going to go through the accomplishments, Jack.
[03:20:09.001 --> 03:20:09.923]  They're unbelievable.
[03:20:09.923 --> 03:20:13.328]  But you watch CNN, he says no accomplishments.
[03:20:13.328 --> 03:20:14.009]  Did nothing!
[03:20:15.726 --> 03:20:17.147]  Yeah, they'll say he's never done anything.
[03:20:17.147 --> 03:20:20.209]  You show that list of accomplishments that people have made.
[03:20:20.209 --> 03:20:21.209]  They've made an entire list.
[03:20:21.209 --> 03:20:23.371]  Oh, then they say, oh, his daddy gave him everything.
[03:20:23.371 --> 03:20:25.752]  How about he won the presidency as an underdog?
[03:20:25.752 --> 03:20:27.713]  How about he got $4 trillion in the stock market?
[03:20:27.713 --> 03:20:30.175]  How about $400 billion and 1.6 million new jobs?
[03:20:30.175 --> 03:20:32.116]  How about new great job numbers today?
[03:20:32.116 --> 03:20:35.078]  How about 69% reduction in illegals coming across?
[03:20:35.078 --> 03:20:36.619]  How about carbon taxes killed?
[03:20:36.619 --> 03:20:38.720]  How about NAFTA and GATT being renegotiated?
[03:20:38.720 --> 03:20:41.161]  How about over 1,000 new companies coming back to the United States?
[03:20:41.161 --> 03:20:43.103]  How about political correctness having its back broken?
[03:20:43.103 --> 03:20:44.924]  How about Al-Qaeda having its ass broken?
[03:20:45.484 --> 03:20:48.587]  And he did it all without Congress.
[03:20:48.587 --> 03:20:51.609]  Yeah, and they're standing in the way of our tax cuts and repealing Obamacare.
[03:20:51.609 --> 03:20:55.972]  We'll have 6% growth rates, they estimate, if they take those balls and chains off us.
[03:20:55.972 --> 03:20:58.194]  The boat is tied up to the dock.
[03:20:58.194 --> 03:21:01.657]  Trump has us on the boat, dragging the dock behind us.
[03:21:01.657 --> 03:21:08.482]  And he's trying to hack the chains, and there's little gremlins like Mueller, and Mueller little goblins biting at his neck and stuff.
[03:21:08.482 --> 03:21:09.423]  What do we do?
[03:21:09.423 --> 03:21:10.624]  A little shift, the shift head.
[03:21:11.044 --> 03:21:20.034]  Yeah, we've got to stand by Trump and we also have to make sure that we're getting the information to him that he needs in every way possible.
[03:21:20.034 --> 03:21:24.059]  By coming up here, by sharing hashtags, by sharing memes on social media.
[03:21:24.059 --> 03:21:27.302]  Social media is a two-way conversation with President Trump.
[03:21:27.302 --> 03:21:28.063]  He goes on there.
[03:21:28.343 --> 03:21:32.465]  He goes on there on his phone, and they're checking on his phone when his phone calls.
[03:21:32.465 --> 03:21:34.907]  They're trying to censor the information that's been given to him.
[03:21:34.907 --> 03:21:43.191]  But when he has the information, when the president is given the information of the actual facts of the situation, he inevitably makes the right decisions.
[03:21:43.191 --> 03:21:45.492]  And they admit there is an informational coup.
[03:21:45.492 --> 03:21:56.158]  You know, the term's been used, house arrest, but I think informational coup against the president and informational kidnapping has been taking place, Jack.
[03:21:56.158 --> 03:21:57.119]  I would have been so
[03:21:58.246 --> 03:21:59.107]  Shocked.
[03:21:59.107 --> 03:22:06.392]  So when the events of Charlottesville happened, the deplorable, horrible events of Charlottesville happened, Trump was in Trump Tower.
[03:22:06.392 --> 03:22:09.435]  He was able to investigate what was going on on his own.
[03:22:09.435 --> 03:22:17.761]  Had he been in the White House, they would have given him lie after lie, distorted everything, and made him do exactly what they wanted him to do.
[03:22:17.761 --> 03:22:27.909]  Instead, he had the full benefit of all the information that was out there on the table, and was able to make his own decision into what he was going to say in the statement he was going to make, and he's been proven
[03:22:28.661 --> 03:22:33.343]  And what, two weeks later, that he was 100% correct in condemning both sides.
[03:22:33.343 --> 03:22:38.364]  And now all of the media is suddenly admitting, oh yeah, Antifa is violent, that's true, they actually were violent.
[03:22:38.364 --> 03:22:42.406]  Yeah, huge victory, everything reversed, their whole giant hoax of three weeks reversed.
[03:22:42.406 --> 03:22:44.706]  Glenn Beck going bankrupt, collapsing.
[03:22:44.706 --> 03:22:45.707]  Total Benedict Arnold.
[03:22:45.707 --> 03:22:47.987]  We're just having victory, victory, victory.
[03:22:47.987 --> 03:22:52.109]  Again, Glenn Beck was the canary or the weasel in the henhouse.
[03:22:52.109 --> 03:22:54.930]  They thought they could send him in to kill a bunch of chickens.
[03:22:54.930 --> 03:22:55.530]  It didn't work!
[03:22:56.050 --> 03:22:58.851]  I mean, everything they're doing, they're coming up zeros!
[03:22:58.851 --> 03:23:00.132]  They're coming up snake eyes!
[03:23:00.132 --> 03:23:01.433]  They're coming up zip!
[03:23:01.433 --> 03:23:06.816]  All the bigots in Texas are just helping one another out, no matter what.
[03:23:06.816 --> 03:23:09.397]  So there's all the bigots in Texas that voted for Trump.
[03:23:09.397 --> 03:23:10.958]  So everything they've said has been proven wrong.
[03:23:10.958 --> 03:23:12.158]  I don't understand.
[03:23:12.158 --> 03:23:15.180]  Why are all these people in Texas trying to help each other?
[03:23:15.180 --> 03:23:17.341]  I thought we were told that Americans hated each other.
[03:23:17.341 --> 03:23:19.442]  I thought we were told we were going to be a race war.
[03:23:19.642 --> 03:23:21.743]  Why liberals are triggered by Hurricane Harvey.
[03:23:21.743 --> 03:23:28.467]  There's hundreds and hundreds of photos and videos of everybody of every skin color, all the human race, helping each other, Jack.
[03:23:28.467 --> 03:23:35.852]  Yeah, well show me a video, show me a video of any American down there in Texas saying I'm not going to help that person because of their skin color.
[03:23:35.852 --> 03:23:36.772]  It doesn't exist.
[03:23:36.772 --> 03:23:40.835]  Oh, actually you have Linda Sarsour saying don't donate to white groups.
[03:23:40.835 --> 03:23:43.756]  Only the left is saying don't help white people.
[03:23:43.756 --> 03:23:44.297]  I'm sorry, yeah.
[03:23:44.297 --> 03:23:44.737]  There you go.
[03:23:45.822 --> 03:23:46.242]  I stand corrected.
[03:23:46.242 --> 03:23:47.803]  Jesse, you're wrong, Jack.
[03:23:47.803 --> 03:23:48.603]  See, I knew it!
[03:23:48.603 --> 03:23:49.223]  We got it!
[03:23:49.223 --> 03:23:50.463]  We got fake news!
[03:23:50.463 --> 03:23:52.424]  You got me on one.
[03:23:52.424 --> 03:23:53.164]  You got me once.
[03:23:53.164 --> 03:23:54.124]  Linda Sarsour.
[03:23:54.124 --> 03:23:56.005]  Darn you, Linda Sarsour!
[03:23:56.005 --> 03:24:05.687]  And her Women's March on their official Twitter said, give money here, don't give it to white people, using that manipulation, when it goes right into a Hamas rat hole.
[03:24:05.687 --> 03:24:07.328]  It's a super PAC!
[03:24:07.328 --> 03:24:09.068]  And she brags about it.
[03:24:09.068 --> 03:24:15.230]  Kamala Harris, the senator there, there's a 3.5% surcharge on hers, and all of that goes to ActBlue.
[03:24:15.856 --> 03:24:19.238]  This is Kamala Harris, which, and believe me, I track what the left is doing.
[03:24:19.238 --> 03:24:22.139]  Kamala Harris, they want her to be the next Hillary.
[03:24:22.139 --> 03:24:25.621]  They want Senator Harris to be the next candidate.
[03:24:25.621 --> 03:24:26.822]  They want her to run.
[03:24:26.822 --> 03:24:33.645]  But she is taking this money from Houston victims and directing it towards Act Blue, which is this huge Soros PAC.
[03:24:33.645 --> 03:24:34.286]  And she doesn't care.
[03:24:35.006 --> 03:24:38.010]  You can see Kamala Harris's arrogance is starting to shine through.
[03:24:38.010 --> 03:24:42.676]  She knows that she's been picked by the establishment to be the next Democrat frontrunner for president.
[03:24:42.676 --> 03:24:43.917]  Bernie Sanders already failed.
[03:24:43.917 --> 03:24:45.700]  They can't try to resurrect that group of people.
[03:24:45.700 --> 03:24:46.601]  Look at this dirtbag!
[03:24:46.601 --> 03:24:47.282]  Look at Sorcerer!
[03:24:49.053 --> 03:24:52.496]  That'll be a nice little team of Sarsour and Kamala Harris.
[03:24:52.496 --> 03:24:54.098]  And that's the amazing thing too, Jack.
[03:24:54.098 --> 03:24:56.039]  Harris, Sarsour, 2020.
[03:24:56.039 --> 03:24:59.142]  They actually think these people will win.
[03:24:59.142 --> 03:25:00.604]  That's the craziest part about it.
[03:25:00.604 --> 03:25:03.867]  They actually think that Kamala Harris is going to be able to win.
[03:25:03.867 --> 03:25:05.348]  No, people know who Kamala Harris is.
[03:25:05.348 --> 03:25:07.410]  They want to move the goalposts and demoralize us.
[03:25:07.410 --> 03:25:08.771]  I think we're so beaten.
[03:25:08.771 --> 03:25:14.657]  Some woman that pushes jihad, the overthrow of the country, that swindles money.
[03:25:15.137 --> 03:25:15.977]  I mean, that's like Hillary.
[03:25:15.977 --> 03:25:17.358]  I guess they thought we were about to re-elect her.
[03:25:17.358 --> 03:25:21.899]  You've got to swindle flood victim money, whether it's Houston or whether it's Haiti.
[03:25:21.899 --> 03:25:24.120]  Yes, just swindle money from a devastated area.
[03:25:24.120 --> 03:25:26.701]  As long as the city or country has an H in the name.
[03:25:26.701 --> 03:25:31.403]  Is there any way we can get Laura Silsby to just happen to walk across the border with some young children too?
[03:25:31.403 --> 03:25:31.903]  That'd be great.
[03:25:32.679 --> 03:25:35.319]  And then change your name and be running a charity for Democrats that come with kids.
[03:25:35.319 --> 03:25:36.220]  Yeah.
[03:25:36.220 --> 03:25:41.181]  And a lot of this is coming up next week in the trial with Bob Menendez, Senator of New Jersey.
[03:25:41.181 --> 03:25:43.921]  It's amazing how the mainstream media isn't even talking about it.
[03:25:43.921 --> 03:25:44.561]  Yeah, you never hear it.
[03:25:44.561 --> 03:25:47.402]  Just every time you turn around, Democrats are in bed with little kids.
[03:25:47.402 --> 03:25:48.362]  He's on trial!
[03:25:48.362 --> 03:25:55.443]  Yeah, Bill de Blasio has an intern that has hundreds of videos and child pornographic images on his computer that to direct.
[03:25:55.443 --> 03:25:58.484]  I mean, look, Manny Mendez doesn't look like a pervert or anything.
[03:25:58.484 --> 03:25:59.624]  No, he doesn't look like him.
[03:25:59.624 --> 03:26:00.384]  He looks like a Ferengi.
[03:26:01.404 --> 03:26:01.845]  Look at this guy.
[03:26:01.845 --> 03:26:02.506]  Look at this guy.
[03:26:02.506 --> 03:26:04.688]  It's Ann Navarro going after him.
[03:26:04.688 --> 03:26:12.378]  You know the word is he's actually an interdimensional spider that chooses the form of that clown to horrify children because it salts the meat.
[03:26:12.378 --> 03:26:13.900]  Would you smash Menendez?
[03:26:13.900 --> 03:26:16.443]  You know why clowns are associated with pedophilia and murder?
[03:26:17.384 --> 03:26:20.346]  I already knew this, but I did my research for about an hour this morning.
[03:26:20.346 --> 03:26:31.653]  It's in all major anthropology that red nose, red around the eyes, white on the face, was gods that you sacrifice children to, and the ancients believed that those were demons they were giving children to.
[03:26:32.699 --> 03:26:42.446]  And so, archetypally, whether you believe they were aliens or not, it is like an alien that's come here that poses as a clown as a priest to kill children.
[03:26:42.446 --> 03:26:43.667]  Pretty crazy, huh?
[03:26:43.667 --> 03:26:45.268]  I'm not surprised.
[03:26:45.268 --> 03:26:47.429]  I was in Bangor.
[03:26:47.429 --> 03:26:48.750]  I was at Stephen King's house.
[03:26:48.750 --> 03:26:50.311]  I was trying to go in there.
[03:26:50.311 --> 03:26:51.172]  He wrote it.
[03:26:51.172 --> 03:26:52.913]  He's got the new movie coming out.
[03:26:52.913 --> 03:26:54.114]  Yeah, it's got the resurgence now.
[03:26:54.554 --> 03:27:00.646]  Yeah, Trump blocked him on Twitter, so I went up there and I stood out front of his gate, which he has, of course, a giant gate in front of Stephen King's house.
[03:27:00.646 --> 03:27:01.688]  Oh yeah, can't have a fence here.
[03:27:01.688 --> 03:27:02.649]  That's a loving gate.
[03:27:02.649 --> 03:27:03.631]  But he's got the giant gate.
[03:27:03.631 --> 03:27:05.294]  No, it's a loving, welcoming gate.
[03:27:05.294 --> 03:27:06.977]  Stephen King knows the plan.
[03:27:08.590 --> 03:27:13.472]  The IT, the running man, he knows what's going on, how they're going to use flu to kill everybody and a vaccine.
[03:27:13.472 --> 03:27:15.432]  He knows, but has decided to join it.
[03:27:15.432 --> 03:27:16.212]  Very evil person.
[03:27:16.212 --> 03:27:17.213]  No, he wrote that in the 70s.
[03:27:17.213 --> 03:27:19.133]  He wrote that in the 70s, the stand.
[03:27:19.133 --> 03:27:19.553]  He's an insider.
[03:27:19.553 --> 03:27:20.553]  He put all of this out there.
[03:27:20.553 --> 03:27:21.314]  He's an insider.
[03:27:21.314 --> 03:27:22.314]  He put all of this out there.
[03:27:22.314 --> 03:27:26.355]  And then they blocked him and he says, he says he doesn't want Trump to go see the new IT movie.
[03:27:26.355 --> 03:27:29.936]  He doesn't want to see any of this stuff because he's going against, again, again against Trump.
[03:27:29.936 --> 03:27:33.637]  But it's like, wait a minute, Trump talks about the stuff that you wrote about.
[03:27:33.637 --> 03:27:37.178]  He gets that stuff out there, but you're just going to be unhinged against him because you don't like him.
[03:27:38.139 --> 03:27:46.066]  Well, I think the explanation for that is you've got, on both sides of the aisle, you've got people that have, you know, quote unquote, broken up, taken the red pill.
[03:27:46.066 --> 03:27:50.430]  So you have the Alex Jones of the world who says, I want to lift the people up.
[03:27:50.430 --> 03:27:51.551]  I want to enlighten the people.
[03:27:51.551 --> 03:27:55.475]  I'm going to dedicate my life to getting this information to people so that they can be empowered.
[03:27:55.475 --> 03:27:56.276]  Let me tell you something.
[03:27:57.036 --> 03:28:07.322]  When he wrote it, no one knew that devil worshippers dress up in clown outfits and torture kids to release endorphins before they drink their blood.
[03:28:07.322 --> 03:28:08.883]  No one knew that when he wrote it.
[03:28:08.883 --> 03:28:10.644]  We've now confirmed the British Royalty do it.
[03:28:10.644 --> 03:28:12.305]  It's been in the British News.
[03:28:12.305 --> 03:28:14.647]  He needs to be asked, how did he know it?
[03:28:14.647 --> 03:28:16.868]  I've been reading this stuff, vampires, all of it.
[03:28:16.868 --> 03:28:18.409]  How does he know all that?
[03:28:19.790 --> 03:28:21.331]  Just saying.
[03:28:21.331 --> 03:28:23.611]  Listen, I'm going to turn this over to you guys right now.
[03:28:23.611 --> 03:28:25.052]  I'm going to take one more call that's been holding.
[03:28:25.052 --> 03:28:30.454]  We'll go to Elka and Bill and others if you guys want to after, but Josh, thanks for holding from Oregon.
[03:28:30.454 --> 03:28:33.935]  You're on the air.
[03:28:33.935 --> 03:28:34.155]  Hello?
[03:28:34.155 --> 03:28:34.775]  Can you hear me?
[03:28:34.775 --> 03:28:36.716]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:28:36.716 --> 03:28:37.356]  Oh, awesome.
[03:28:37.356 --> 03:28:45.419]  Hey, so I've got a comment about the hurricane, but real quick, can I give you a little bit of information about General Kelly?
[03:28:45.419 --> 03:28:47.080]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:28:47.080 --> 03:28:47.280]  Okay.
[03:28:47.887 --> 03:28:54.169]  So, General Kelly actually endorsed the critical infrastructure designation by Jay Johnson.
[03:28:55.090 --> 03:28:58.453]  It was only in one article that I saw, and that was SDW.
[03:28:58.453 --> 03:28:59.253]  Hold on, hold over.
[03:28:59.253 --> 03:29:00.214]  This is too big, Josh.
[03:29:00.214 --> 03:29:01.095]  You've been holding.
[03:29:01.095 --> 03:29:09.461]  Credible infrastructure designation for the elections allowed them to federalize it deep state once Trump was elected because they were planning an overthrow in a new emergency election.
[03:29:09.461 --> 03:29:10.942]  That's what they do in third world countries.
[03:29:10.942 --> 03:29:12.644]  We're going to come back to Josh.
[03:29:12.644 --> 03:29:13.304]  I didn't know this.
[03:29:13.304 --> 03:29:14.585]  Give us the source during the break.
[03:29:14.585 --> 03:29:15.466]  I believe you.
[03:29:15.466 --> 03:29:17.507]  This is big breaking news.
[03:29:17.507 --> 03:29:22.992]  Because if that's the case, it shows a real mole's gotten in because he's positioning the overthrow of the president.
[03:29:24.032 --> 03:29:30.499]  And it already endorsed the COG transfer, which Kelly will be acting president during that emergency.
[03:29:30.499 --> 03:29:34.362]  Just like Alexander Haig tried to do, saying, I'm now in charge, I'm now in command.
[03:29:34.362 --> 03:29:34.903]  Stay with us.
[03:29:34.903 --> 03:29:35.684]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:29:35.684 --> 03:29:38.426]  This is InfoWars.
[03:29:38.426 --> 03:29:39.828]  We're on the march.
[03:29:39.828 --> 03:29:42.350]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:42.350 --> 03:29:45.053]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:50.538 --> 03:30:01.502]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:30:01.502 --> 03:30:08.545]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[03:30:08.545 --> 03:30:17.669]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.
[03:30:19.346 --> 03:30:21.127]  Independence isn't a day.
[03:30:21.127 --> 03:30:22.168]  It's a mindset.
[03:30:22.168 --> 03:30:24.930]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[03:30:24.930 --> 03:30:26.551]  I will not be your slave.
[03:30:26.551 --> 03:30:32.615]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[03:30:32.615 --> 03:30:37.578]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[03:30:37.578 --> 03:30:39.460]  Slaves are never safe.
[03:30:39.460 --> 03:30:42.462]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[03:30:42.462 --> 03:30:43.562]  Guard your liberty.
[03:30:43.562 --> 03:30:46.884]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[03:30:46.884 --> 03:30:48.806]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:30:50.247 --> 03:30:58.974]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[03:30:58.974 --> 03:30:59.514]  That's right.
[03:30:59.514 --> 03:31:04.779]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[03:31:04.779 --> 03:31:11.464]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use.
[03:31:11.464 --> 03:31:18.730]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[03:31:19.070 --> 03:31:19.270]  Woo!
[03:31:19.270 --> 03:31:20.311]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:31:20.311 --> 03:31:29.036]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[03:31:29.036 --> 03:31:38.642]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[03:31:38.642 --> 03:31:42.084]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[03:31:42.084 --> 03:31:46.206]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[03:31:46.206 --> 03:31:47.047]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:31:47.267 --> 03:31:49.808]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:05.595 --> 03:32:07.697]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:32:07.697 --> 03:32:08.978]  In fact, it's certified.
[03:32:08.978 --> 03:32:14.122]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:32:14.122 --> 03:32:20.847]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:32:20.967 --> 03:32:23.968]  The Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:32:23.968 --> 03:32:27.669]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:32:27.669 --> 03:32:34.572]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:32:34.572 --> 03:32:42.074]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[03:32:59.850 --> 03:33:04.642]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.943 --> 03:33:09.585]  Emperor Jones has left the studio.
[03:33:09.585 --> 03:33:13.748]  Darth Troya has now taken over the broadcast.
[03:33:13.748 --> 03:33:16.009]  I'm joined by Jedi Knight, Jack Posobiec.
[03:33:16.009 --> 03:33:25.616]  We're going to get back to our caller, Josh, who had a story on General Kelly and some potential collusion with the Feds to try to, perhaps, rig the election.
[03:33:25.616 --> 03:33:26.816]  It's okay when Obama says it.
[03:33:26.816 --> 03:33:28.077]  Trump's not allowed to say it, though.
[03:33:28.077 --> 03:33:31.720]  But before we get to that, I have to tell you about Infowarsstore.com.
[03:33:31.720 --> 03:33:36.463]  We've got a lot of specials going on right now, specifically on the caveman formula.

[03:34:17.192 --> 03:34:19.033]  I always make a Caveman shake.
[03:34:19.033 --> 03:34:27.139]  You know, I do put a banana in there, but after seeing what happened on the college campus, apparently I can't use bananas anymore because that's considered a racist thing to eat a banana.
[03:34:27.759 --> 03:34:29.321]  But there's other specials.
[03:34:29.321 --> 03:34:31.644]  57% off Super Male Vitality.
[03:34:31.644 --> 03:34:33.807]  I mean, these specials are ridiculous.
[03:34:33.807 --> 03:34:35.148]  This is the Labor Day special.
[03:34:35.148 --> 03:34:38.973]  57% off Super Male Vitality.
[03:34:38.973 --> 03:34:39.654]  A great product.
[03:34:39.654 --> 03:34:42.097]  Another product that I use every day.
[03:34:42.938 --> 03:34:44.819]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:34:47.900 --> 03:34:49.580]  The store, I don't know how many items.
[03:34:49.580 --> 03:34:51.101]  We should probably do like an item check.
[03:34:51.101 --> 03:34:54.182]  We've got hundreds of items at the InfoWarsTore now.
[03:34:54.182 --> 03:34:55.282]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:34:55.282 --> 03:34:56.643]  You're gonna find something that you like.

[03:35:01.764 --> 03:35:03.225]  It's just truly
[03:35:03.985 --> 03:35:09.609]  A great store to fund what we do here at InfoWars, and we are now expanding our broadcast.

[03:35:28.863 --> 03:35:29.264]  All right, guys.
[03:35:29.904 --> 03:35:31.885]  So let's get back to our caller Josh.
[03:35:31.885 --> 03:35:36.527]  Do we have the story that he was talking about ready to go?
[03:35:36.527 --> 03:35:39.028]  Let's go back to Josh and I'll have the crew pull up that story.
[03:35:39.028 --> 03:35:46.731]  So Josh, what did you discover with this story and what do you think the angle is here that Kelly was using?
[03:35:46.731 --> 03:35:54.654]  Well, I know, you know, Trump right now, he's surrounded by mainly Democrats and generals, which is kind of unfortunate in some ways.
[03:35:54.654 --> 03:35:58.076]  And we all know that McMaster is a deep state operative, basically.
[03:35:58.757 --> 03:36:08.039]  With Kelly, I've kind of been on the fence with him, but I found this article from June 6th, and it was the only article I saw that even mentioned this, but I'm just going to quote from the article here.
[03:36:08.039 --> 03:36:24.402]  It says, Kelly told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on June 6th that despite pushback, despite pushback he's received from state and local election officials, as well as quote, many members of Congress, he would support the designation put in place by predecessor Jay Johnson.
[03:36:26.769 --> 03:36:29.971]  So I thought that was pretty shocking when I read that.
[03:36:29.971 --> 03:36:33.693]  Well, I'd like to read it for myself, if we could have the crew pull it up here.
[03:36:33.693 --> 03:36:46.502]  And we'll get Posobiec's take on this too, because it sounds to me like it's just a thing where General Kelly is just kind of going along with what's already been there, and he just decided not to take up this fight.
[03:36:46.502 --> 03:36:47.742]  We'll try to get more information on this.
[03:36:47.742 --> 03:36:50.144]  In fact, if you guys could actually just print me this story.
[03:36:50.144 --> 03:36:51.765]  Jack, what's your first reaction to this?
[03:36:55.325 --> 03:37:03.275]  Just going back to what I saw in terms of the original Department of Homeland Security, Jay Johnson, when he ruled on this is, number one, I agree with you.
[03:37:03.275 --> 03:37:09.502]  Kelly did not spend enough time at the department to really dig into these issues, to really get into what was going on.
[03:37:10.223 --> 03:37:15.428]  The first thing he did, you know, he was obviously making a lot of choices on southern border wall, making a lot of decisions there.
[03:37:15.428 --> 03:37:18.350]  That was the focus on border security on the south.
[03:37:18.350 --> 03:37:25.937]  This other stuff that was going on, he didn't really change what was happening with Department of Homeland Security policy, but at the same time, this
[03:37:26.697 --> 03:37:38.123]  Ruling that Johnson is putting out, it lays the groundwork from a legal perspective for them to come in from the Department of Homeland Security and essentially federalize our voting systems.
[03:37:38.123 --> 03:37:43.045]  Now the voting system back in 2012, you and I talked about this almost every day when I would come on the show.
[03:37:43.045 --> 03:37:47.148]  We talked about how easy it is to manipulate these electronic voting machines.
[03:37:47.148 --> 03:37:47.488]  Right.
[03:37:47.488 --> 03:37:55.852]  And now they're trying to take that vulnerability and turn it around and say, oh no, no, no, it's the Russians who are attacking the machines.
[03:37:56.192 --> 03:38:02.676]  Based on like some blanket, you know, statement that somebody made somewhere, and they then federalize it.
[03:38:02.676 --> 03:38:12.761]  Well, if you're federalizing this electronic voting process, that opens up so many opportunities for disenfranchisement, so many opportunities for just shenanigans that are going on.
[03:38:12.761 --> 03:38:15.963]  And it takes the power away from the states to monitor their own elections.
[03:38:17.102 --> 03:38:19.263]  Yeah, we need to be going the opposite direction with this.
[03:38:19.263 --> 03:38:24.905]  The EU, as socialist as the EU is, they tried electronic voting and totally did away with it.
[03:38:24.905 --> 03:38:26.186]  They went back to the paper ballots.
[03:38:26.186 --> 03:38:27.166]  They said, you know what?
[03:38:27.166 --> 03:38:29.187]  There's too much at stake here.
[03:38:29.187 --> 03:38:30.688]  There's way too much to get rid of it.
[03:38:30.688 --> 03:38:31.488]  It's ridiculous!
[03:38:31.488 --> 03:38:33.509]  Like you said, I mean, there's all these reports.
[03:38:33.509 --> 03:38:34.829]  We've been talking about this.
[03:38:34.829 --> 03:38:35.629]  It's simple.
[03:38:35.629 --> 03:38:36.290]  It's obvious.
[03:38:36.290 --> 03:38:37.430]  It's common sense.
[03:38:37.430 --> 03:38:39.431]  Yes, this is an electronic machine.
[03:38:39.431 --> 03:38:40.852]  It can be hacked.
[03:38:40.852 --> 03:38:43.453]  And then you have all these hackers showing how they can do it.
[03:38:43.453 --> 03:38:46.354]  All these different news corporations showing you how they can do it.
[03:38:46.954 --> 03:38:54.460]  But I agree with, I think we're both kind of at the same consensus here where it looks like Kelly just chose not to fight this battle, probably just left it there.
[03:38:54.460 --> 03:38:58.062]  We know what the Department of Homeland Security's goal was to try to do with this thing.
[03:38:58.062 --> 03:38:59.984]  We know what Jay Johnson was trying to do with this thing.
[03:38:59.984 --> 03:39:02.566]  And I'm not sitting here glorifying Kelly or anything.
[03:39:02.566 --> 03:39:05.308]  I don't like the fact that he's trying to control information getting to Trump.
[03:39:05.308 --> 03:39:07.109]  I'm just trying to call it as I see it.
[03:39:07.109 --> 03:39:12.493]  But real quick, and then I want to go back to Josh with his thoughts on this, and then we'll move on to other callers.
[03:39:12.493 --> 03:39:14.615]  Because he mentioned McMaster and Kelly.
[03:39:14.615 --> 03:39:15.816]  I found it very interesting.
[03:39:16.983 --> 03:39:27.628]  Sebastian Gorka, who is no longer in Trump's White House administration, actually spoke highly of McMaster just the other day in an interview with Michael Savage.
[03:39:27.628 --> 03:39:30.049]  He, in fact, even said McMaster was a patriot.
[03:39:30.049 --> 03:39:33.611]  So I don't know if he's just blowing smoke there, but I just wanted to point that out.
[03:39:33.611 --> 03:39:35.172]  I thought that that was interesting.
[03:39:35.172 --> 03:39:36.913]  And then you also have to mention the fact that Trump
[03:39:37.293 --> 03:39:40.394]  Has been nothing but high praises of General Kelly.
[03:39:40.394 --> 03:39:45.995]  In fact, I even think today Trump tweeted again the high praises for General Kelly.
[03:39:45.995 --> 03:39:48.276]  So I'm just putting that out there.
[03:39:48.276 --> 03:39:49.276]  But let's go back to Josh.
[03:39:49.276 --> 03:39:50.056]  Final comments, Josh.
[03:39:50.056 --> 03:39:51.957]  So what do you think the angle here is?
[03:39:51.957 --> 03:39:55.358]  What do you think about this story that you discovered?
[03:39:55.358 --> 03:40:00.619]  Well, yeah, I mean, for sure, you know, you've got people, you know, playing, you know, with all the jokes about 40 chest stuff.
[03:40:00.619 --> 03:40:01.460]  It's real, though.
[03:40:01.460 --> 03:40:02.760]  I mean, that stuff goes on, you know.
[03:40:03.553 --> 03:40:13.079]  It's serious thinking that has to go on and people can't just broadcast what they're planning on doing all the time.
[03:40:13.079 --> 03:40:19.003]  But definitely, one quote that he said that definitely concerned me is he said, quote, we're here to help.
[03:40:19.003 --> 03:40:24.446]  And it just reminded me of Ronald Reagan and his famous quote about the government when they're coming to help.
[03:40:25.816 --> 03:40:27.997]  Yeah, the three words you don't want to hear.
[03:40:27.997 --> 03:40:29.418]  I'm from the government or whatever it is.
[03:40:29.418 --> 03:40:30.879]  Yeah.
[03:40:30.879 --> 03:40:32.280]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:40:32.280 --> 03:40:33.581]  I think it's funny that.
[03:40:33.581 --> 03:40:34.082]  Oh, sorry.
[03:40:34.082 --> 03:40:36.123]  Well, no, I was going to say thank you for the call.
[03:40:36.123 --> 03:40:38.585]  I'm reading the story now and I could definitely see.
[03:40:38.585 --> 03:40:48.211]  I mean, when you actually read the story, it is it is a lot more alarming than when you step back and try to try to look at it from a further perspective.
[03:40:48.211 --> 03:40:53.154]  But again, you got to understand sometimes I don't know about this Chase Gunter from FCW.
[03:40:53.154 --> 03:40:54.215]  I'm not too familiar with him.
[03:40:54.215 --> 03:40:54.995]  I don't know if Jack is.
[03:40:56.677 --> 03:41:04.344]  You know, when you write stories like this, you can pick and choose words to try to paint a different picture than may be entirely accurate.
[03:41:04.344 --> 03:41:10.289]  So again, I don't know if this is something that Kelly is really fully behind, as this interview kind of alludes to.
[03:41:11.930 --> 03:41:30.305]  Or, if this is just an instance of Kelly just kind of going along with it, because as said in the article, it was supported by Congress, oh wow, shocker, the Deep State Congress, and it was something that General Johnson, or excuse me, Jay Johnson was already pushing for, and so he just kind of said, okay, yeah, we're just going to go along with it.
[03:41:30.305 --> 03:41:34.768]  Is that technically him doubling down, as quoted in this article?
[03:41:34.768 --> 03:41:36.249]  I don't know if that's fair to say.
[03:41:36.249 --> 03:41:36.890]  What do you think, Jack?
[03:41:37.881 --> 03:41:47.773]  You know, I wanted to comment on what you said about how the president essentially was, you know, praising General Kelly and Gorka had come out and said McMaster is a patriot and I would agree with them.
[03:41:47.773 --> 03:41:51.978]  I would definitely agree that they are patriots and they are looking to serve their country.
[03:41:51.978 --> 03:41:55.983]  However, what people need to understand is, under Barack Obama,
[03:41:56.503 --> 03:42:03.231]  The General Corps and the Admiral Corps of the Army, the Marines, and the Navy, it was uplifted.
[03:42:03.231 --> 03:42:10.079]  The people were promoted through the War College system that only agreed with the Obama agenda, okay?
[03:42:10.079 --> 03:42:13.543]  They were taught a certain perspective on how to look at the world,
[03:42:13.883 --> 03:42:16.526]  And it was this, it was the globalist perspective.
[03:42:16.526 --> 03:42:34.723]  So when you were writing your dissertation at the War College, when you were writing your papers, you were doing your research, it all had to include sort of those same buzzwords, the climate change, migration, you know, ISIS isn't really Islamic, all of these different agreements that you had to go along with and that's how you raised, got higher up and higher up in rank.
[03:42:35.223 --> 03:42:38.166]  So, to say that they're not patriots, I wouldn't be sure.
[03:42:38.166 --> 03:42:39.067]  They're patriots.
[03:42:39.067 --> 03:42:41.690]  But they view the world greatly differently.
[03:42:41.690 --> 03:42:50.238]  They view America's role as being sort of like the spread arms wide blanket of security for the entire globe.
[03:42:50.798 --> 03:42:54.463]  And everything that goes on in the world is the purview of the United States.
[03:42:54.463 --> 03:43:01.531]  You know, the world police is sort of like the phrase that a lot of people use satirically, but that is kind of what it's like.
[03:43:01.531 --> 03:43:05.295]  They view America's role as stabilization for Asia Pacific.
[03:43:05.575 --> 03:43:05.875]  We're good.
[03:43:21.348 --> 03:43:27.792]  Many people don't know this, but the national anthem that we sing is only like 20% of the song.
[03:43:27.792 --> 03:43:30.174]  It's only one verse of the song.
[03:43:30.174 --> 03:43:39.239]  There's actually another verse in the song that says, where there are enemies of freedom, we feel it's our duty to go there and to spread freedom, to manifest freedom around the planet.
[03:43:39.239 --> 03:43:40.800]  So maybe that's kind of what you're talking about.
[03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:41.821]  I mean, I'm not a warmonger.
[03:43:41.821 --> 03:43:42.842]  I'm not an expansionist.
[03:43:42.842 --> 03:43:44.403]  I'm just talking about history here.
[03:43:45.307 --> 03:43:47.368]  I'll even throw you another red pill in the anthem.
[03:43:47.368 --> 03:43:58.231]  If you go back even further, one of the earlier drafts of that song that Prince Scott Key had written actually was in response to the Barbary Pirates Wars.
[03:43:58.231 --> 03:44:01.832]  You know, the Marines, they talk about hauls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, right?
[03:44:01.832 --> 03:44:03.172]  The fighting in Tripoli.
[03:44:03.172 --> 03:44:09.854]  So one of the earlier drafts of the national anthem actually included lines about turbans and the crescent moon.
[03:44:09.854 --> 03:44:11.335]  Because that's who the Barbary Pirates were.
[03:44:11.335 --> 03:44:12.255]  It was the Ottoman Empire.
[03:44:12.255 --> 03:44:12.815]  It was Muslims.
[03:44:13.763 --> 03:44:14.324]  There you go.
[03:44:14.324 --> 03:44:15.785]  Couple history red pills.
[03:44:15.785 --> 03:44:17.667]  Talking National Anthem with Jack Posobiec.
[03:44:17.667 --> 03:44:19.209]  I love it.
[03:44:19.209 --> 03:44:22.413]  And I just want to say, and then let's go to another caller here, Jack.
[03:44:22.413 --> 03:44:26.878]  After reading this story, I just completed it, another thing crops into my head.
[03:44:26.878 --> 03:44:28.880]  This is how my brain works.
[03:44:28.880 --> 03:44:30.281]  So, Secretary Kelly...
[03:44:32.003 --> 03:44:34.006]  I take brain force from Infowars.com.
[03:44:34.006 --> 03:44:38.611]  So Secretary Kelly, the story says, doubles down.
[03:44:38.611 --> 03:44:42.735]  Basically, I mean, he supports it and he says, yeah, OK, we're going to support this.
[03:44:42.735 --> 03:44:45.138]  We want to consider this critical infrastructure.
[03:44:45.138 --> 03:44:46.739]  We think this is the right thing to do.
[03:44:46.739 --> 03:44:49.683]  And we're here to protect voting, basically.
[03:44:49.683 --> 03:44:50.724]  So this is so funny to me.
[03:44:52.139 --> 03:45:01.307]  If Russia hacked our election, as the narrative they like to put out there, if Russia was trying to infiltrate these voting machines and all of this was going on,
[03:45:02.349 --> 03:45:06.252]  Well then why hasn't the Department of Homeland Security made a statement?
[03:45:06.252 --> 03:45:12.276]  Why hasn't the Department of Homeland Security that designated this critical infrastructure, why haven't they done an investigation?
[03:45:12.276 --> 03:45:13.557]  Where's their reporting?
[03:45:13.557 --> 03:45:20.222]  Are you trying to use reason and critical thinking to talk about what's going on in the Department of Homeland Security?
[03:45:20.222 --> 03:45:21.803]  Owen, what is going on here?
[03:45:21.803 --> 03:45:22.623]  You're right.
[03:45:22.623 --> 03:45:24.945]  I think I should just take Debbie Washerman Schultz's word for it.
[03:45:25.848 --> 03:45:28.871]  Yeah, don't you... These aren't the servers you're looking for.
[03:45:28.871 --> 03:45:29.771]  Move along.
[03:45:29.771 --> 03:45:31.072]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:45:31.072 --> 03:45:33.114]  What server that I'm beating with a hammer?
[03:45:33.114 --> 03:45:34.555]  What are you talking about?
[03:45:34.555 --> 03:45:35.757]  There's no server here?
[03:45:35.757 --> 03:45:37.418]  Don't worry about these blackberries.
[03:45:37.418 --> 03:45:39.280]  Don't worry about this leaf bit.
[03:45:39.280 --> 03:45:45.925]  What IT aid that worked for dozens of Democrats and made millions of dollars that was trying to leave the country and send money to Pakistan?
[03:45:45.925 --> 03:45:47.687]  What IT aid?
[03:45:47.687 --> 03:45:48.547]  Give me a break.
[03:45:48.547 --> 03:45:49.969]  It was Russia!
[03:45:49.969 --> 03:45:51.070]  It was Russia!
[03:45:52.734 --> 03:45:59.656]  Okay, let's go- We have no evidence whatsoever, but clearly- And we're not gonna give you the evidence we don't have, so shut up, it was Russia!
[03:45:59.656 --> 03:46:03.437]  Alright, let's go to Bill in Wisconsin.
[03:46:03.437 --> 03:46:04.658]  Thank you for joining us, Bill.
[03:46:04.658 --> 03:46:05.878]  Hey Owen, can you hear me?
[03:46:05.878 --> 03:46:06.358]  Loud and clear.
[03:46:06.358 --> 03:46:07.679]  Can you guys hear me?
[03:46:07.679 --> 03:46:10.720]  Alright, so, uh, it's good.
[03:46:10.720 --> 03:46:18.142]  I love the, uh, video of the, um, instant karma for Antifa when you got punched, it was great.
[03:46:20.028 --> 03:46:20.989]  That's me!
[03:46:20.989 --> 03:46:24.030]  I'm the one who's getting punched in that video!
[03:46:24.030 --> 03:46:24.610]  No, I know.
[03:46:24.610 --> 03:46:25.450]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:46:25.450 --> 03:46:26.530]  I watch you every couple days.
[03:46:26.530 --> 03:46:26.891]  Yeah, thank you.
[03:46:26.891 --> 03:46:28.291]  I appreciate it.
[03:46:28.291 --> 03:46:28.451]  Great.
[03:46:28.451 --> 03:46:48.358]  Anyway, I'm just calling to say that I think that the reason Nancy Pelosi and all those loony toons, Paul Ryan and everybody, came out denouncing Antifa is because they know that this violent overthrow of Trump is coming and they're doing it to save face.
[03:46:49.329 --> 03:46:52.472]  Yeah, there's definitely an element of that, no doubt.
[03:46:52.472 --> 03:47:03.881]  But regardless of what their motives are, it again proves Trump 100% right and shows how weak these people really are.
[03:47:03.881 --> 03:47:06.043]  I think it really shows how weak they are more than anything.
[03:47:06.043 --> 03:47:08.405]  And let's go down Paul Ryan for a second here, Jack.
[03:47:09.326 --> 03:47:21.253]  Paul Ryan is now coming out and he thinks, Paul Ryan thinks he's the president, so he's going to make the decisions on DACA, he's going to save DACA, he's telling President Trump we can fix DACA, we can do something about this.
[03:47:21.253 --> 03:47:34.481]  That's funny because years ago, Paul Ryan was a guest on Sean Hannity and said that DACA was clearly unconstitutional and in fact attacked Barack Obama relentlessly on DACA because it was unconstitutional.
[03:47:35.001 --> 03:47:39.423]  This shows you how these people operate, folks.
[03:47:39.423 --> 03:47:42.425]  Look, Paul Ryan is such a shill.
[03:47:42.425 --> 03:47:44.165]  Paul Ryan is so shallow.
[03:47:44.165 --> 03:47:53.870]  Paul Ryan is such a fraud that he's so dumb, he doesn't even think, wait a second, in the past, I said DACA was unconstitutional and I attacked it hardcore.
[03:47:54.170 --> 03:47:57.714]  No, he doesn't even think like that because he never had a real stance.
[03:47:57.714 --> 03:47:59.076]  He never had a real stance.
[03:47:59.076 --> 03:48:06.826]  If you had a real stance and you said that on Sean Hannity, you would come out and you would say, wait a second, in the past, I've said this was unconstitutional.
[03:48:06.826 --> 03:48:08.187]  I should stand by my guns there.
[03:48:08.187 --> 03:48:10.010]  And if I'm going to change my mind, I should address why.
[03:48:10.470 --> 03:48:11.010]  No!
[03:48:11.010 --> 03:48:12.251]  He doesn't address any of that.
[03:48:12.251 --> 03:48:13.451]  He doesn't bring any of that up.
[03:48:13.451 --> 03:48:15.112]  He just fights Trump.
[03:48:15.112 --> 03:48:17.233]  This is the true nature of these people, Jack.
[03:48:17.233 --> 03:48:22.735]  They just do whatever is in the moment, whatever they think is right, whatever they're told is right.
[03:48:22.735 --> 03:48:26.036]  No real thought, no real critical thinking, no real concern over the country.
[03:48:26.036 --> 03:48:27.136]  Just whatever.
[03:48:27.136 --> 03:48:27.397]  Sure.
[03:48:27.397 --> 03:48:29.337]  Oh, I said that eight years ago?
[03:48:29.337 --> 03:48:30.178]  Oh, oops.
[03:48:30.178 --> 03:48:30.578]  I don't know.
[03:48:31.775 --> 03:48:41.300]  Paul Ryan is the kind of guy, oh and he goes around Washington DC, and everybody's seen this, as he doesn't walk into a room where he doesn't think he's the smartest person.
[03:48:41.300 --> 03:48:53.547]  And he's got his little briefcase and he opens up and pulls out these like, these briefings that he's made with all of his wonderful quote-unquote arguments that are handed to him by like Cato Institute and Heritage Foundation, and he just reads it off.
[03:48:54.808 --> 03:48:55.049]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:49:10.489 --> 03:49:12.690]  This wasn't, like, ten years ago or something.
[03:49:12.690 --> 03:49:14.850]  This was, like, three years ago.
[03:49:14.850 --> 03:49:18.891]  Maybe not even fully three years ago, where he said, no, DACA is unconstitutional.
[03:49:18.891 --> 03:49:23.753]  So, why not at least have the intellectual integrity to come out and say, you know what?
[03:49:23.753 --> 03:49:25.433]  I said it was unconstitutional then.
[03:49:25.433 --> 03:49:26.794]  I stand by that statement.
[03:49:26.794 --> 03:49:27.534]  Well, that's the thing.
[03:49:27.534 --> 03:49:31.095]  He never even stood by his original statement, and that's the point.
[03:49:31.095 --> 03:49:33.075]  These people have no real statements of their own.
[03:49:33.075 --> 03:49:36.716]  We're now joined again by Alex Jones, absolutely on fire.
[03:49:36.716 --> 03:49:37.877]  What's going on, Alex?
[03:49:37.877 --> 03:49:38.177]  Well, no.
[03:49:39.451 --> 03:49:42.415]  I know you've got Mike Cernovich very busy shooting a film right now.
[03:49:42.415 --> 03:49:44.018]  He's about to pop in, so we're skipping this break.
[03:49:44.018 --> 03:49:50.267]  So I'm only going to spend a couple minutes on this, then get these latest updates from Mike Cernovich, and of course, Jack Krasavich and yourself.
[03:49:50.267 --> 03:49:51.809]  But I just wanted to point out...
[03:49:52.748 --> 03:49:58.472]  Your video you shot up the other day has 15 million views, 8.5 million on one Facebook, 4 million on another.
[03:49:58.472 --> 03:49:59.713]  We just counted it up.
[03:49:59.713 --> 03:50:02.075]  It's like 15, almost 15 million views.
[03:50:02.075 --> 03:50:05.677]  And it just shows, it's not even an edited video, it's just raw 20 minutes.
[03:50:05.677 --> 03:50:11.421]  And we totaled up our videos in just the last week, we've had 40 plus million views.
[03:50:11.421 --> 03:50:13.163]  And this is despite all the censorship.
[03:50:13.763 --> 03:50:17.768]  Everything else that's going on, I mean, just liberty is on fire!
[03:50:17.768 --> 03:50:20.150]  And there's another viral video that we didn't shoot that I meant to get to.
[03:50:20.150 --> 03:50:22.313]  It's when police states really do police state things.
[03:50:22.313 --> 03:50:23.854]  I want to expose it.
[03:50:23.854 --> 03:50:28.079]  And that is this latest thing out of Salt Lake City, Utah.
[03:50:28.079 --> 03:50:32.384]  You talk about a real police state where the lady, the nurse, won't violate HIPAA, federal law.
[03:50:32.384 --> 03:50:34.866]  You can't take blood from somebody who refuses.
[03:50:35.567 --> 03:50:38.270]  Or who is incapacitated and unconscious.
[03:50:38.270 --> 03:50:41.412]  So they arrest her for not following orders.
[03:50:41.412 --> 03:50:42.473]  This is a bad cop.
[03:50:42.473 --> 03:50:43.274]  This is a police state.
[03:50:43.274 --> 03:50:46.217]  So I just wanted to put on screen, it's now 8 million views.
[03:50:46.217 --> 03:50:48.879]  Sorry, I guess it's gone up since I looked at it 5 minutes ago.
[03:50:48.879 --> 03:50:52.422]  15 million views total on a video you uploaded a day and a half ago.
[03:50:52.422 --> 03:50:53.923]  I mean, it's just, it's not just this.
[03:50:53.923 --> 03:50:55.545]  It's everything we're doing is on fire.
[03:50:55.545 --> 03:50:57.326]  Posobiec's on fire.
[03:50:57.326 --> 03:50:58.347]  Cernovich is on fire.
[03:50:58.347 --> 03:51:00.869]  I mean, it's just en fuego, baby!
[03:51:00.869 --> 03:51:02.111]  En fuego!
[03:51:02.691 --> 03:51:09.538]  But then I saw this viral video this morning, and I meant to get to it, so let's play this, and then get Mike Cernovich's take on that, and then everybody else will have comments.
[03:51:09.538 --> 03:51:11.299]  But here's the video.
[03:51:11.299 --> 03:51:15.523]  Nurse forcibly arrested for not allowing cop to draw blood of unconscious patient.
[03:51:15.523 --> 03:51:16.765]  Salt Lake City Tribune, here it is.
[03:51:19.480 --> 03:51:27.406]  Brad, I'm just putting it on speaker so you can- So, I have the- It says obtaining blood samples for police enforcement from patients suspected to be under the influence.
[03:51:27.406 --> 03:51:28.267]  Okay?
[03:51:28.267 --> 03:51:32.370]  This is something that you guys agreed to with this hospital.
[03:51:32.370 --> 03:51:38.695]  The three things that allow us to do that are if you have an electronic warrant, patient consent, or patient under arrest.
[03:51:38.695 --> 03:51:43.598]  And neither of those things- The patient can't consent.
[03:51:43.598 --> 03:51:46.120]  He's told me repeatedly that he doesn't have a warrant.
[03:51:46.120 --> 03:51:47.962]  And the patient is not under- She's just following along.
[03:51:48.922 --> 03:51:50.903]  How dare she know the law, though?
[03:51:50.903 --> 03:51:53.445]  That's the real offense here.
[03:51:53.445 --> 03:51:59.109]  Okay, so I take it without those in place, I'm not going to do what?
[03:51:59.109 --> 03:52:01.691]  And that's the hospital's agreement with the cops!
[03:52:01.691 --> 03:52:02.252]  Go ahead.
[03:52:02.252 --> 03:52:04.393]  Am I fair to surmise that?
[03:52:04.393 --> 03:52:06.415]  Alex, you're not representing me.
[03:52:06.415 --> 03:52:08.196]  You're not representing me.
[03:52:08.196 --> 03:52:12.399]  And her boss is telling her don't do it.
[03:52:12.399 --> 03:52:13.840]  Oh, another thought criminal.
[03:52:13.840 --> 03:52:16.081]  I have no idea why he's blaming me.
[03:52:16.081 --> 03:52:17.903]  I'm just representing you.
[03:52:19.764 --> 03:52:22.545]  She's the one that has told me no.
[03:52:22.545 --> 03:52:27.207]  Yeah, but sir, you're making a huge mistake right now.
[03:52:27.207 --> 03:52:28.568]  You're making a huge mistake.
[03:52:28.568 --> 03:52:29.688]  Let's hear this.
[03:52:29.688 --> 03:52:30.669]  Okay.
[03:52:30.669 --> 03:52:31.909]  No, we're done.
[03:52:31.909 --> 03:52:32.390]  We're done.
[03:52:32.390 --> 03:52:33.650]  You're under arrest.
[03:52:33.650 --> 03:52:34.570]  We're done.
[03:52:34.570 --> 03:52:39.853]  He thinks her following the law is illegal.
[03:52:39.853 --> 03:52:40.893]  Well, that's a bad cop.
[03:52:40.893 --> 03:52:43.434]  Now, where's Antifa on this?
[03:52:43.434 --> 03:52:45.635]  Where are all the protests on this?
[03:52:45.635 --> 03:52:46.956]  What the hell is this cop's problem?
[03:52:48.684 --> 03:52:50.486]  Some people say, oh, because it's a white lady, you're upset.
[03:52:50.486 --> 03:52:51.426]  I don't care if she's black.
[03:52:51.426 --> 03:52:52.107]  I don't care who she is.
[03:52:52.107 --> 03:52:52.607]  This is crazy.
[03:52:52.607 --> 03:52:55.449]  I have bad administration on the way.
[03:52:55.449 --> 03:52:59.392]  I mean, they have to follow federal and state law.
[03:52:59.392 --> 03:53:01.874]  I mean, why would you even treat the woman like this?
[03:53:01.874 --> 03:53:04.796]  You know, I mean, this is just, it's just, the tactics are absurd.
[03:53:04.796 --> 03:53:07.038]  Well, Mike Cernovich, what do you make of this insanity?
[03:53:08.792 --> 03:53:13.234]  Yeah, I mean, this has been happening for the militarization of police.
[03:53:13.234 --> 03:53:14.755]  This has been happening for years.
[03:53:14.755 --> 03:53:16.676]  And of course, you know, where is Antifa?
[03:53:16.676 --> 03:53:21.138]  Where are the rights activists and civil libertarians and everything?
[03:53:21.138 --> 03:53:22.219]  They don't really care because
[03:53:23.024 --> 03:53:25.627]  They are part and parcel to all of this.
[03:53:25.627 --> 03:53:26.728]  I'm not surprised.
[03:53:26.728 --> 03:53:30.731]  You know, this has been going on for, you know, years and years.
[03:53:30.731 --> 03:53:34.875]  Just like the cops standing down when they follow orders to let Antifa beat people up.
[03:53:34.875 --> 03:53:37.197]  Them folks will say, oh, thought you were kissing the cops' butts.
[03:53:37.197 --> 03:53:42.943]  No, we don't want to randomly kill cops that have done nothing, like Black Lives Matter, but we also don't support cops thinking they're God, Mike.
[03:53:44.198 --> 03:53:50.161]  Well, and for years we've covered police misconduct, including, you know, shooting dogs.
[03:53:50.161 --> 03:53:52.602]  They'll go into the wrong house and they'll shoot your dog.
[03:53:52.602 --> 03:53:57.344]  Or maybe they've shot dogs that are just behind a fence, minding their own business.
[03:53:57.344 --> 03:54:00.686]  There is a problem in America with tyranny.
[03:54:00.686 --> 03:54:02.807]  There's always going to be a problem in America with tyranny.
[03:54:02.807 --> 03:54:04.467]  And most cops are great.
[03:54:04.467 --> 03:54:07.409]  But cops like that, that guy, that is false arrest and kidnapping.
[03:54:07.409 --> 03:54:09.630]  That cop belongs in prison.
[03:54:09.630 --> 03:54:12.011]  He should be arrested immediately and sent to prison.
[03:54:12.631 --> 03:54:19.135]  And you hear the hospital administrator saying, officer, you're making a big mistake.
[03:54:19.135 --> 03:54:20.256]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:54:20.256 --> 03:54:26.199]  And it sounded like he just snapped, he's unfit for the uniform, he needs to go to prison, man.
[03:54:26.199 --> 03:54:27.060]  There's no question.
[03:54:27.060 --> 03:54:32.263]  What he did there, if you or I or anybody else had done that, we would have been in prison for kidnapping.
[03:54:32.263 --> 03:54:35.585]  And that is what he did because he had no lawful authority to do that.
[03:54:35.585 --> 03:54:36.706]  He definitely belongs in prison.
[03:54:37.188 --> 03:54:54.515]  I think the real danger here, Alex, is that, and this is the real police state problem that I think we would all agree with, where they put the whole entire police thing over the Constitution, and these cops say, okay, it's more important for us to build our case against this suspected guy who I guess they pulled over a DUI or whatever.
[03:54:54.515 --> 03:55:03.558]  It's more important for us to break the law, get this sample, so that we can have our case, than it is to actually follow the law, obey the Constitution, and treat that woman with dignity.
[03:55:03.558 --> 03:55:08.039]  Well, it's a much bigger violation for him to violate the big general Fourth Amendment.
[03:55:08.039 --> 03:55:09.260]  But then we're all screwed.
[03:55:09.260 --> 03:55:11.761]  Whereas now we've got Mueller going after Trump and all this.
[03:55:11.761 --> 03:55:12.901]  And where are all the lawyers?
[03:55:12.901 --> 03:55:14.181]  Where are all the good lawyers out there?
[03:55:14.181 --> 03:55:16.062]  Where are all the liberal lawyers?
[03:55:16.062 --> 03:55:20.803]  Well, the difference is that's why it's bad to have anti-fine Black Lives Matter randomly shooting cops in the back.
[03:55:20.803 --> 03:55:23.604]  Because then it makes any real criticism of cops look like them.
[03:55:23.604 --> 03:55:25.405]  It's a real polarization.
[03:55:25.405 --> 03:55:25.905]  Mike Cernovich?
[03:55:27.688 --> 03:55:37.837]  That's why I believe that Black Lives Matter was designed to bring us to a police state because for years and years and years all of us have criticized
[03:55:38.547 --> 03:55:41.328]  I appreciate you popping in and I'll let you back up on soon.
[03:55:41.328 --> 03:55:42.648]  I know you're making a film right now.
[03:55:42.648 --> 03:55:44.688]  But Mike, other tidbits, any breaking news since yesterday?
[03:56:03.989 --> 03:56:11.198]  You know, Jack had that great story about how there are a bunch of patriot veterans who are, and that is a true story.
[03:56:11.198 --> 03:56:12.479]  Yeah, talk about that, both of you.
[03:56:12.479 --> 03:56:13.240]  I'm going to unplug yours.
[03:56:13.240 --> 03:56:14.081]  You've got the last few minutes.
[03:56:14.081 --> 03:56:14.322]  Go ahead.
[03:56:16.198 --> 03:56:21.864]  Yeah, so Jack Vestova can talk about it, you know, in more detail, but I've talked to people about the stories that broke.
[03:56:21.864 --> 03:56:34.837]  And there is now Patriot veterans are forming a think tank, a war room, so to speak, online, where they're going to try to figure out ways to combat the deep state coup going on right now.
[03:56:34.837 --> 03:56:35.858]  And that's for you, Jack.
[03:56:35.858 --> 03:56:36.739]  That's your story, of course.
[03:56:38.923 --> 03:56:45.130]  Yeah I know Mike, I appreciate that and it's great because I know you've been you and I have been talking to some of the same people here in DC.
[03:56:45.130 --> 03:56:55.101]  This actually goes up to a lot higher levels of people that were previously in the administration up until very recently if that kind of gives a few clues out there.
[03:56:55.101 --> 03:56:58.745]  A lot of this could come publicly very very soon but I was given the
[03:57:00.567 --> 03:57:02.628]  Approval to bring it out today to write it up.
[03:57:02.628 --> 03:57:07.090]  They knew I was going to come on the show today, Alex, and I wanted to get it out to the InfoWars audience to let people know.
[03:57:07.090 --> 03:57:16.634]  And I can even just say in the hour since I first mentioned this, I've had probably over 100 messages through Twitter and email saying, hey, I want to be part of this.
[03:57:16.634 --> 03:57:18.655]  I see the exact same thing that's going on.
[03:57:18.655 --> 03:57:19.375]  I'm a patriot.
[03:57:19.375 --> 03:57:20.376]  You're 100 percent right.
[03:57:20.376 --> 03:57:20.856]  How can I help?
[03:57:25.356 --> 03:57:30.240]  Alright, Jack, I don't know if we still have Cernovich on with us or not, but I was waiting for his response.
[03:57:30.240 --> 03:57:31.801]  We're in the final minutes of the show here.
[03:57:31.801 --> 03:57:32.382]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[03:57:32.382 --> 03:57:34.243]  Go ahead, go ahead, Mike, go ahead.
[03:57:34.243 --> 03:57:35.284]  No, no, definitely, yeah.
[03:57:35.284 --> 03:57:44.712]  People, there is an active underground community of patriots in America who want to fight back and do want to fight deep state.
[03:57:44.712 --> 03:57:47.594]  But there's also going to be a lot of stuff going on in the future of elections.
[03:57:47.594 --> 03:57:49.956]  I mean, in fact, you know, I can't go into too much detail.
[03:57:51.703 --> 03:58:04.931]  I mean, I personally have been in discussions with special operations veterans on ways to employ totally legal and lawful protest techniques for activism.
[03:58:07.108 --> 03:58:10.211]  Well, there's no doubt that the globalists want to bring in a police state.
[03:58:10.211 --> 03:58:14.254]  We've been calling that out for years, and Mike Cernovich is probably on to something.
[03:58:14.254 --> 03:58:22.040]  Using BLM, using Antifa, using all this domestic violence to get the patriots that make the difference in this country to actually get behind it.
[03:58:22.040 --> 03:58:23.141]  Thanks, Jack Posobiec.
[03:58:23.141 --> 03:58:24.242]  Thanks, Mike Cernovich.
[03:58:24.242 --> 03:58:25.223]  Alex Jones, great as usual.
[03:58:25.223 --> 03:58:26.344]  This has been Owen Schroer.
