[00:00:03.543 --> 00:00:05.888]  We are on the march.
[00:00:05.888 --> 00:00:09.297]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:12.164]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:33.510]  Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, volunteered for the MKUltra Mind Control Program.
[00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.334]  No, I'm not talking about the MKUltra Mind Control Program of Netflix hit show, Stranger Things.
[00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:44.837]  I'm talking about the real MKUltra Mind Control Program.
[00:00:46.374 --> 00:00:52.422]  That was carried out on college campuses and other facilities across the country in the late 1960s.
[00:00:52.422 --> 00:01:03.657]  From San Francisco, California, to Austin, Texas, to the Chicago Business School in Chicago, Illinois, to Harvard University on the East Coast, to MIT.
[00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:13.477]  And so you'll hear people say, oh, it's a conspiracy theory that Charlie Manchin was a Satanist, or it's a conspiracy theory that Hollywood was into Satanism.
[00:01:13.477 --> 00:01:14.257]  That's the headlines.
[00:01:14.257 --> 00:01:23.480]  But if you go back to the 60s, there was a law enforcement craze, they called it, that law enforcement was claiming there was all this Satanism.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.381]  No, there was Satanism.
[00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:28.642]  There was massive human sacrifice going on.
[00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:35.424]  And it was being done to enter in the new age, to have Lucifer exterminate 90% of the world's population,
[00:01:36.744 --> 00:01:41.985]  And then have humans merge with machines and become the new god men.
[00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:45.166]  Now I talked about that in my film 10 years ago, Endgame.
[00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:59.068]  Suddenly this last week there were London Guardian, Associated Press, Reuters stories about, oh this tech head from Google has left to start his new worship the AI cult and all these famous people are part of it.
[00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:00.668]  Oh, he'll be the leader now.
[00:02:00.668 --> 00:02:02.509]  It just came out of nowhere.
[00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:03.969]  It's the same plan.
[00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:08.098]  It originated in London, England in 1855.
[00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:18.441]  It is a long-term world government project whose endgame is to exterminate the majority of the world population to save the Earth.
[00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:25.243]  And then they're going to have the enlightened folks move forward.
[00:02:25.243 --> 00:02:27.004]  Transcend.
[00:02:27.004 --> 00:02:29.084]  And I have a stack of it right here.
[00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:32.305]  And they just think you're stupid.
[00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:34.566]  They just think you're complete and total morons.
[00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.372]  And that you're not gonna understand this.
[00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:40.353]  This is their religion.
[00:02:40.353 --> 00:02:41.714]  This is their program.
[00:02:41.714 --> 00:02:43.355]  It's to shut down the family.
[00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:45.017]  It's to destroy Christians.
[00:02:45.017 --> 00:02:51.182]  It is to pull down civilization and society, just like the French Revolution tried to do.
[00:02:51.182 --> 00:02:53.624]  Overthrow decency.
[00:02:53.624 --> 00:02:55.465]  Overthrow success.
[00:02:55.465 --> 00:02:56.847]  Overthrow beauty.
[00:02:56.847 --> 00:02:58.628]  Overthrow honor.
[00:02:58.628 --> 00:03:00.069]  Desecrate it.
[00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.850]  Blaspheme it.
[00:03:04.304 --> 00:03:11.907]  And every day there's TV ads saying fathers are bad, masculinity is bad, families are evil, get rid of them.
[00:03:11.907 --> 00:03:33.895]  This is the program and you've got all these zombie-like acolytes that everybody got to witness this last weekend across the country at more Antifa demonstrations who can't even talk and just scream and yell and grunt and flip people off.
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.804]  And this is a program.
[00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:50.217]  So you hear the same thing out of Charles Manson, the same thing out of Theodore Kaczynski, the same thing out of these guys because they came out of the same colleges.
[00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:51.459]  They went to the same college.
[00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:56.887]  Manson was part of a CIA mind control program.
[00:03:56.887 --> 00:03:58.927]  He wrote songs with the Beach Boys.
[00:03:58.927 --> 00:04:01.028]  He knew most of the big Hollywood stars.
[00:04:01.028 --> 00:04:14.171]  He was invited into their houses because he was a bag man for the CIA who was delivering the drugs into the circles to begin the mind control operations.
[00:04:15.646 --> 00:04:16.908]  And Hollywood knows this.
[00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:31.287]  They've put movies out, kind of a modern fiction contemporary, but based back in the 60s and 70s in California, where it's the FBI that's actually handing out the drugs and the LSD, because that's who was actually doing it.
[00:04:31.287 --> 00:04:33.049]  But again, it was compartments of the FBI.
[00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:40.378]  And Jack Parsons and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and all of them having big sex orgies.
[00:04:40.378 --> 00:04:52.147]  I mean, this was the end thing to do and they were able to use satanism and drugs as a program to really take over a lot of civilization and compromise people in human sacrifice.
[00:04:52.147 --> 00:04:54.289]  And then it goes into pedophilia.
[00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.250]  Sharon Tate was married to Roman Polanski.
[00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.671]  We'll be back.
[00:04:58.416 --> 00:05:09.861]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:18.785]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better, and then the other two is a
[00:05:19.005 --> 00:05:27.748]  Powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[00:05:27.748 --> 00:05:32.749]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable Floralife Everyday Maintenance.
[00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:43.032]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[00:05:43.032 --> 00:05:48.434]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[00:05:48.894 --> 00:06:00.099]  When you purchase it at InfoWarsTore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:10.324]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[00:06:10.324 --> 00:06:16.827]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:31.736]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:32.497]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.497 --> 00:06:37.361]  Thank you for joining us on this Monday, the 20th day of November, 2017.
[00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:43.065]  Well, Charlie Manson of Helter Skelter is deader to doornail.
[00:06:47.014 --> 00:06:53.778]  Cult leader, murderer Charles Manson dies at 83.
[00:06:53.778 --> 00:07:07.625]  Now back then, it was really weird and crazy to have somebody on PCP and LSD running around killing beauty queens and coffee baronesses.
[00:07:07.625 --> 00:07:09.426]  It was a big, big deal.
[00:07:09.426 --> 00:07:10.146]  It was shocking.
[00:07:10.146 --> 00:07:12.847]  But nowadays, everybody's crazy.
[00:07:12.847 --> 00:07:15.789]  This is the godfather of the Antifa movement.
[00:07:16.857 --> 00:07:22.558]  This is the godfather of the modern environmental movement.
[00:07:22.558 --> 00:07:29.720]  This is a man that wanted 90% of the world's population to be exterminated by a world government.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:41.782]  And a man who wanted to ignite the breakdown of civilization by causing race war, playing different ethnic and religious groups off against each other around the world in a divide and conquer strategy.
[00:07:43.305 --> 00:08:07.772]  The truth is, Charlie Manson was inducted into a higher level CIA DARPA mind control program and inserted into the highest levels of rock and roll, movies, he knew all the major folks, co-wrote songs for the Beach Boys, the list goes on and on, and was delivering large amounts of pure weapons grade LSD to campuses all over California.
[00:08:10.117 --> 00:08:15.581]  Then the wind-up toy either went off the rails or was ordered to carry out the murders.
[00:08:15.581 --> 00:08:17.482]  We don't know still to this day.
[00:08:17.482 --> 00:08:19.143]  But he was CIA.
[00:08:19.143 --> 00:08:21.565]  100%.
[00:08:21.565 --> 00:08:28.629]  They had mind control programs going on right here at the University of Texas in the 60s and at other major universities.
[00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:36.915]  Charlie Manson hung around the same university that Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, went to and volunteered for the MKUltra program.
[00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:45.006]  It's kind of like volunteering to jump into a hornet's nest, because once you're on those drugs, there's no more volunteering, because you didn't know what you were getting into.
[00:08:45.006 --> 00:08:47.487]  But this is the program.
[00:08:47.487 --> 00:08:55.410]  Sex, drugs, luring in the police, luring in the FBI, luring in all the politicians to get dirt on them.
[00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.312]  What was big and bad and evil in the 1960s to the Puritan America?
[00:09:00.312 --> 00:09:02.073]  Devil worship.
[00:09:02.073 --> 00:09:07.095]  But if you could get people to worship the devil, to have sex with super hot movie stars,
[00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:13.516]  While next it was, we need you to kill somebody.
[00:09:13.516 --> 00:09:15.860]  And that's what Charlie Manson was about.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.665]  He was one MKUltra tentacle.
[00:09:19.574 --> 00:09:20.594]  That went sideways.
[00:09:20.594 --> 00:09:36.760]  And then they used it to create the whole new popular culture where it's so cool to be whacked out of your brain a shaman who knows everything and can do everything and has got your cult of trendies that go from being hippies to being cold-blooded murderers.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.180]  That's always what it is.
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:43.682]  First they get you peace and love and nirvana and you can do anything and all of a sudden, but there's a price to pay.
[00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:48.032]  There's always a Dracula in the shadows.
[00:09:48.032 --> 00:10:10.537]  We can put Sharon Tate up behind me, hear from one of the horror movies she was in, and movies about Satanism, and movies about human sacrifice, and movies about burning men, and movies about royal Rothschild estates, and the estates dying, and there's poverty in the village, until the owner of the estate
[00:10:11.522 --> 00:10:14.824]  is willing to be sacrificed for the good of everyone.
[00:10:14.824 --> 00:10:22.267]  I mean, this is nothing but French Revolution, Jacobin manipulation.
[00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:27.449]  The whole revolution you're seeing is French Revolution Part 2.
[00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:39.375]  They saw we were launching ours in 1776 for the real New Atlantis, for Sir Francis Bacon, the real Rosicrucian Order,
[00:10:40.808 --> 00:10:56.956]  Esoteric Christianity, and they created their counterfeit, which is just every flavor of rebellion, death, degradation, and it's all about psychopathic men being able to have women and others programmed and under their control to do horrible things.
[00:11:00.657 --> 00:11:05.461]  And boy, Charlie Manson was jealous of the cult above him.
[00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:07.462]  He was getting kicked out of that cult.
[00:11:07.462 --> 00:11:09.324]  They weren't being nice to him anymore.
[00:11:09.324 --> 00:11:10.224]  So what'd he do?
[00:11:10.224 --> 00:11:13.447]  He went and killed their high priestess.
[00:11:13.447 --> 00:11:15.709]  He told people he did too.
[00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:18.050]  He went and killed their goddess.
[00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:25.376]  He went and killed who they thought was the number one woman in the Hollywood cult of Roman Polanski and others.
[00:11:25.376 --> 00:11:28.759]  While he was out of town, they killed her and they killed his baby.
[00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:34.827]  They showed him what would happen if Charlie Manson didn't get to stay in the cult.
[00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:41.869]  Charlie Manson created a list of people that weren't partying with him anymore and weren't, you know, buying his LSD anymore.
[00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:45.890]  And he went in there and he killed them.
[00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:54.772]  And that, my friends, is the rest of the story of Charlie Little Man Manson.
[00:11:54.772 --> 00:11:55.992]  All that stuff he was saying.
[00:11:55.992 --> 00:11:59.333]  People were like, wow, this guy's really smart.
[00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:05.316]  He's spewing everything that the eugenicists and the globalists have been spewing.
[00:12:05.316 --> 00:12:06.856]  That's their religion.
[00:12:06.856 --> 00:12:22.999]  Charlie Manson is a whacked-out, street-level conman that they used to go around and control people because he was expendable.
[00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:28.500]  He was just one more little power-tripping person that thought he was God, who wanted to be a cult leader.
[00:12:30.964 --> 00:12:45.253]  When all he really was, was an icon being created to introduce the second Jacobin revolution inside this country.
[00:12:45.253 --> 00:12:51.557]  And see, if you know the group, if you know their religion, if you know their program, overthrow the family, break everything up.
[00:12:52.912 --> 00:12:57.134]  Then you know why you see the shaving ads out, where men are bad.
[00:12:57.134 --> 00:12:59.094]  We must stop toxic masculinity.
[00:12:59.094 --> 00:13:00.975]  That story is on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:00.975 --> 00:13:04.837]  You know why we're saying you can't say the word mother and father.
[00:13:04.837 --> 00:13:08.338]  That's the new word to be banned by Facebook, saying it's hurtful.
[00:13:08.338 --> 00:13:09.438]  You think I'm joking?
[00:13:09.438 --> 00:13:11.379]  They're moving forward with it.
[00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:13.220]  Don't be stoic.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.500]  Don't be a rock.
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.361]  Don't be strong.
[00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:18.662]  It actually says in the ad, be weak.
[00:13:21.994 --> 00:13:29.818]  It actually says it's time for a new definition of masculinity, and we're going to tell you what that definition is.
[00:13:29.818 --> 00:13:30.818]  It's a silent ad.
[00:13:30.818 --> 00:13:33.960]  You have to go see it at Infowars.com.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.421]  This is their program.
[00:13:35.421 --> 00:13:37.062]  This is their operation.
[00:13:37.062 --> 00:13:39.203]  Overthrow everything.
[00:13:39.203 --> 00:13:44.405]  They've got 25% of the population on psychotropic drugs that are in the hallucinogen class.
[00:13:44.405 --> 00:13:49.368]  They've now got weaponized marijuana being put out to the George Soros movement.
[00:13:51.673 --> 00:13:53.214]  That is hallucinogenic.
[00:13:53.214 --> 00:13:57.417]  And I'm not calling for making marijuana illegal.
[00:13:57.417 --> 00:13:58.898]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:13:58.898 --> 00:14:02.780]  They want to have the dialectic of putting the drugs out and having you use it and putting you in prison.
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:03.721]  I'm against that.
[00:14:03.721 --> 00:14:15.168]  But people need to understand that this is a very, very serious situation and is part of a larger operation to put you into a near dream state.
[00:14:16.001 --> 00:14:17.702]  So that you're not really conscious.
[00:14:17.702 --> 00:14:21.823]  Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream.
[00:14:21.823 --> 00:14:24.904]  Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.
[00:14:24.904 --> 00:14:36.607]  If I wanted to come on this show and talk to you like they do on NPR to put you into a trance, I could do it.
[00:14:36.607 --> 00:14:44.910]  But on purpose, I have a grating voice to get you out of your coma, to shake you free out of it.
[00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:55.642]  You know, if I wanted to, I could talk just as sweet and just as pretty as all these fake people, but I don't do that.
[00:14:55.642 --> 00:14:58.223]  I let you hear my real voice.
[00:14:58.223 --> 00:14:59.643]  And it's everything they hate.
[00:14:59.643 --> 00:15:00.863]  It's masculine.
[00:15:00.863 --> 00:15:01.904]  It's grating.
[00:15:01.904 --> 00:15:04.064]  It's like an alarm in the night.
[00:15:04.064 --> 00:15:06.165]  It's like a Marine Corps drill sergeant!
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.241]  I'm not copying a Marine Corps drill sergeant.
[00:15:10.241 --> 00:15:22.751]  Drill sergeants are trying to encompass the classic status of a male instructing people in serious, dangerous things that affect their life so people listen!
[00:15:22.751 --> 00:15:26.013]  So they understand what's going on!
[00:15:26.013 --> 00:15:30.857]  So you've been warned!
[00:15:30.857 --> 00:15:33.178]  So if you've got what it takes, you'll listen.
[00:15:33.178 --> 00:15:34.619]  If you don't, you were warned.
[00:15:34.619 --> 00:15:35.360]  We did our job.
[00:15:36.991 --> 00:15:39.294]  Coming up, we got a bunch of clips of Charlie Manson.

[00:17:59.784 --> 00:18:03.567]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:18:03.567 --> 00:18:11.312]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:18:11.312 --> 00:18:19.938]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:18:19.938 --> 00:18:24.320]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.684]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:18:29.924 --> 00:18:34.166]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:18:34.166 --> 00:18:37.587]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:18:37.587 --> 00:18:48.711]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:18:48.711 --> 00:18:51.613]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[00:18:51.613 --> 00:18:57.615]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at Infowarslife.com with AnthroPlex.
[00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:06.074]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:19:06.074 --> 00:19:07.575]  Op-op-op-optimum levels.
[00:19:08.666 --> 00:19:13.309]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[00:19:13.309 --> 00:19:15.650]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.411]  B vitamins we need every day.
[00:19:17.411 --> 00:19:22.694]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[00:19:22.694 --> 00:19:24.975]  O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[00:19:24.975 --> 00:19:30.658]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[00:19:30.658 --> 00:19:31.058]  Secret 12.
[00:19:31.058 --> 00:19:31.819]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[00:19:32.179 --> 00:19:32.499]  I think so.
[00:20:00.513 --> 00:20:22.648]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.648 --> 00:20:27.531]  You're listening to InfoWars Live with yours truly, Alex Jones.
[00:20:27.531 --> 00:20:29.033]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:20:29.915 --> 00:20:36.437]  Well, Charles Manson is dead, and that is the big story around the world.
[00:20:36.437 --> 00:20:52.182]  And if you study Charles Manson and the Manson family, and what went on there, it was the fact that the entire country at that point had been turned into a CIA mind control laboratory.
[00:20:52.182 --> 00:20:58.804]  The universities were being flooded with hallucinogenic drugs.
[00:21:00.799 --> 00:21:16.871]  The owners of Time Life and others on the East Coast since the 30s had been taking LSD since it had been discovered in Switzerland.
[00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:18.432]  But they were taking a lot of other drugs.
[00:21:18.432 --> 00:21:22.175]  And these are the most straight-laced, richest people in the country.
[00:21:22.175 --> 00:21:25.177]  If you go to the history books, they were taking LSD.
[00:21:25.177 --> 00:21:29.461]  They'd been taking peyote and other witches' brews.
[00:21:30.868 --> 00:21:32.669]  For a long time.
[00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:34.010]  But there's a headline right there.
[00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.412]  The time in life of an acid trip.
[00:21:36.412 --> 00:21:41.995]  How Henry R. Luce and Claire Booth Luce helped turn America on to LSD.
[00:21:41.995 --> 00:21:43.116]  And again, that's the publishers.
[00:21:43.116 --> 00:21:47.379]  Some of the biggest publishers in U.S.
[00:21:47.379 --> 00:21:48.200]  history.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:53.443]  So again, these are old people in suits and ties.
[00:21:53.443 --> 00:21:57.366]  Decades before, in the late 30s, into the 40s and 50s.
[00:21:57.366 --> 00:21:59.607]  Taking hallucinogenic drugs.
[00:21:59.607 --> 00:22:00.388]  Part of cults.
[00:22:02.622 --> 00:22:04.602]  Part of spiritual cults.
[00:22:04.602 --> 00:22:06.923]  And they weren't all devil worshippers.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:10.563]  But it was a lot of really heavy stuff.
[00:22:10.563 --> 00:22:20.945]  They then developed a plan by the early 60s to flood all the major universities after they tested the drugs on people inside the CIA, inside the military.
[00:22:20.945 --> 00:22:25.586]  Top generals all took it.
[00:22:25.586 --> 00:22:30.767]  They then set out on a plan that had already been set up by the British
[00:22:34.195 --> 00:22:51.882]  To set up the world government, then shut down the family, start flooding the population with pharmaceutical drugs, and to come out with pharmaceutical drugs that had you in an LSD state, but you were still somewhat conscious.
[00:22:51.882 --> 00:22:57.564]  You weren't seeing hallucinations, but you were in a dream state, but still somewhat conscious in between those two states.
[00:22:58.592 --> 00:23:03.836]  And by the way, if you're a radio listener, while I'm talking on the radio, the crew's just typing in what I've said.
[00:23:03.836 --> 00:23:08.600]  You know, CIA flooding the streets with LSD.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.281]  And we're showing you History Channel.
[00:23:10.281 --> 00:23:11.782]  We're showing you Associated Press.
[00:23:11.782 --> 00:23:13.444]  We're showing you Time Magazine.
[00:23:13.444 --> 00:23:16.266]  This is all incontrovertible history.
[00:23:16.266 --> 00:23:17.807]  There's San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:23:17.807 --> 00:23:24.032]  When the CIA ran an LSD sex house in San Francisco.
[00:23:24.032 --> 00:23:26.234]  Well, that's just one sex house.
[00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:36.918]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, it's really just because the people at the CIA wanted to have whorehouses in every town that were taxpayer-paid for that they could enjoy.
[00:23:36.918 --> 00:23:38.419]  And a lot of girls were showing up in L.A.
[00:23:38.419 --> 00:23:48.868]  and San Francisco to be movie stars, so they would be there and just pick them off, you know, the Greyhound buses and induct them into CIA operations, use them as sex operatives, you name it.
[00:23:48.868 --> 00:23:50.589]  And this is a big story.
[00:23:50.589 --> 00:23:56.274]  But Charlie Manson is only just one guy they put into things, and he
[00:23:57.236 --> 00:24:17.324]  He wrote not just one but several songs with the Beach Boys and other bands and he got to know the main Hollywood crew and he got to learn not just from the CIA and the drugs he was being given but from all the different cults in Hollywood how things ran and who really ran the world and what the plan was.
[00:24:17.324 --> 00:24:20.465]  So when you hear a guy that probably took LSD over a thousand times
[00:24:22.523 --> 00:24:23.703]  Looking completely insane.
[00:24:23.703 --> 00:24:28.224]  Looking like a cross between a homeless person and a guru.
[00:24:28.224 --> 00:24:29.244]  Gibbering all this.
[00:24:29.244 --> 00:24:30.705]  You say, where does he get it?
[00:24:30.705 --> 00:24:37.246]  He got it directly from their battle plan.
[00:24:37.246 --> 00:24:40.687]  Yeah, there's the founder of the Beach Boys with Charlie Manson right there.
[00:24:40.687 --> 00:24:45.548]  So, this was going on.
[00:24:45.548 --> 00:24:51.589]  And they had Charlie Manson types who were the gurus over the universities in every city.
[00:24:54.113 --> 00:25:00.615]  And again, that was somebody, if things went wrong, could be destroyed.
[00:25:00.615 --> 00:25:14.019]  And the reason I mention all that is coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play a bunch of clips of Charlie Manson, and you're going to go, wait a minute, this is everything the Democrats and Al Gore and Antifa and George Soros says.
[00:25:14.019 --> 00:25:21.642]  And then you see Alex Soros and all these parties drugged out of his mind, spewing the same crap, and they're carrying some lady in a coffin behind him in one photo.
[00:25:21.642 --> 00:25:22.442]  They're spirit cooking.
[00:25:25.742 --> 00:25:34.668]  They're doing Aleister Crowley magic, just like Jack Parsons and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory out there and NASA.
[00:25:34.668 --> 00:25:46.457]  They literally went and bought the biggest, oldest, gothic mansions they could, all over the country, and had eyes wide shut parties, and they got the mayor, and they got your daughter, and they got your son involved, and that's how they took over!
[00:25:48.666 --> 00:25:58.594]  And that's what we're dealing with, folks, is a bunch of pedophile devil worshippers today, because now it's not sick enough to just, you know, have sex with hot chicks on altars.
[00:25:58.594 --> 00:26:01.117]  That's just the entryway into it.
[00:26:01.117 --> 00:26:03.579]  It gets much worse, the blood drinking.
[00:26:05.589 --> 00:26:06.309]  But that's not enough.
[00:26:06.309 --> 00:26:11.631]  You've got to ship out Factor VIII to millions of people with HIV and Hepatitis and give it to everybody.
[00:26:11.631 --> 00:26:17.353]  And you've got to legalize giving blood if you've got HIV in California to spread that.
[00:26:17.353 --> 00:26:18.794]  That's human sacrifice.
[00:26:18.794 --> 00:26:21.474]  And you've got to sexualize children at a young age.
[00:26:21.474 --> 00:26:23.495]  You've got to give them fluoride.
[00:26:23.495 --> 00:26:24.736]  And you've got to give them Prozac.
[00:26:24.736 --> 00:26:26.836]  You've got to give them Ritalin.
[00:26:26.836 --> 00:26:28.517]  And you've got to bombard them with GMO.
[00:26:28.517 --> 00:26:31.398]  You've got to slowly sacrifice the whole planet!
[00:26:34.679 --> 00:26:43.128]  So, Charles Manson is a Renfield that blew its gasket and thought it was a Dracula.
[00:26:45.506 --> 00:26:47.167]  That's the best thinking.
[00:26:47.167 --> 00:26:50.750]  We know he worked for the CIA and other groups and was protected.
[00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.592]  And he blew a gasket and thought he was Dracula.
[00:26:53.592 --> 00:26:56.114]  He thought he was the big powerful leader.
[00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:57.936]  He thought he was in charge.
[00:26:57.936 --> 00:27:05.502]  He thought he was the big Lucifer and he was going to launch the big global meltdown and the worldwide extermination.
[00:27:07.608 --> 00:27:13.470]  And you go out to these Antifa parades and they all, men and women, look just like him.
[00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:20.251]  They're crazed, they got an evil spirit in them, and all they want to do is hang you up by your toes and rip your guts out.
[00:27:20.251 --> 00:27:23.172]  And roll around in them on the ground.
[00:27:23.172 --> 00:27:33.915]  They can murder a pregnant beauty queen, murder, murder one of the favorite girls of Dracula, then that kind of makes you Dracula, doesn't it?
[00:27:34.974 --> 00:27:38.516]  And that's why he's praised by the lower-level minions.
[00:27:38.516 --> 00:27:41.938]  Because they, in a psychopathic order, want to be Dracula, you see.
[00:27:41.938 --> 00:27:44.620]  They want to be the archetypal Dracula, the Prince Charles.
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.081]  The direct line of Dracula.
[00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:48.863]  They want to be on the throne.
[00:27:48.863 --> 00:27:50.063]  And you know what?
[00:27:50.063 --> 00:27:55.947]  This little Renfield, he killed one of Dracula's wenches!
[00:27:55.947 --> 00:27:59.389]  That makes him a big man.
[00:27:59.389 --> 00:28:00.450]  We come back.
[00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.291]  The SJW.
[00:28:03.291 --> 00:28:03.932]  Grandfather.
[00:28:05.305 --> 00:28:11.867]  The LSD, CIA, MKUltra, Monkey Boy, Charles Manson!
[00:28:11.867 --> 00:28:13.328]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:13.328 --> 00:28:14.288]  Ha!
[00:28:14.288 --> 00:28:15.648]  The whole story.
[00:28:15.648 --> 00:28:18.509]  The rest of the story.
[00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:21.190]  Hidden news.
[00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:24.871]  From 40 plus years ago, now revealed today.
[00:28:24.871 --> 00:28:27.212]  Because you don't just get tomorrow's news today.
[00:28:27.212 --> 00:28:30.473]  Or the news of 10 years ago.
[00:28:31.411 --> 00:28:33.534]  That was hidden, now today.
[00:28:33.534 --> 00:28:37.140]  You get it from thousands of years ago.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.823]  Hidden.
[00:28:38.823 --> 00:28:40.626]  Until now.
[00:28:40.626 --> 00:28:44.372]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com are our main sites.
[00:28:44.372 --> 00:28:45.774]  They're under constant globalist attack.
[00:28:47.082 --> 00:28:50.844]  The enemy is doing everything they can to shut us down because we can see for miles.
[00:28:50.844 --> 00:28:52.384]  We are on the march.
[00:28:52.384 --> 00:28:55.306]  The empire is on the run.
[00:28:55.306 --> 00:28:58.327]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:58.327 --> 00:29:00.668]  Why NuMana storable foods?
[00:29:00.668 --> 00:29:02.009]  We believe in freedom.
[00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:05.410]  America needs strong, independent families to endure what's ahead.
[00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.951]  And we take this charge seriously.
[00:29:06.951 --> 00:29:08.011]  We got options.
[00:29:08.011 --> 00:29:08.491]  Organic.
[00:29:08.491 --> 00:29:09.432]  No gluten.
[00:29:09.432 --> 00:29:10.752]  Without the chemicals.
[00:29:10.752 --> 00:29:12.293]  Great taste and value.
[00:29:12.293 --> 00:29:16.595]  NuMana is a no-lose investment for your family's food independence.
[00:29:16.775 --> 00:29:18.475]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[00:29:18.475 --> 00:29:19.036]  That's true.
[00:29:19.036 --> 00:29:22.717]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?
[00:29:35.816 --> 00:29:41.020]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty and guarantees.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:45.203]  No stock market risk, no tax risk, and no penalties.
[00:29:45.203 --> 00:29:49.026]  Call Life Benefits if you'd like a free book about how this can be done.
[00:29:49.026 --> 00:29:49.307]  Call 702-660-7000.
[00:29:49.307 --> 00:29:49.727]  That's 702-660-7000.
[00:29:59.102 --> 00:30:02.227]  America is an information-based civil war.
[00:30:02.227 --> 00:30:09.677]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[00:30:09.677 --> 00:30:15.286]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[00:30:16.027 --> 00:30:23.697]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[00:30:23.697 --> 00:30:31.628]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[00:30:32.288 --> 00:30:37.352]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[00:30:37.352 --> 00:30:39.494]  They are the anti-liberals.
[00:30:39.494 --> 00:30:52.884]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:52.884 --> 00:30:56.867]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:57.848 --> 00:31:17.822]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:31:17.822 --> 00:31:19.943]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:31:19.943 --> 00:31:23.946]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:23.946 --> 00:31:25.147]  I want to thank everybody that has, but
[00:31:25.387 --> 00:31:31.191]  We've got the best chloride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:31:31.191 --> 00:31:33.573]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.

[00:31:36.214 --> 00:31:38.996]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:31:38.996 --> 00:31:41.978]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:41.978 --> 00:31:50.684]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:31:50.684 --> 00:31:55.127]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:31:57.829 --> 00:32:04.094]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.
[00:32:04.094 --> 00:32:08.458]  This powerful combo is perfect for supporting your thyroid and health.
[00:32:08.458 --> 00:32:15.764]  BioTrue Selenium's formula is far from synthetic and is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[00:32:15.764 --> 00:32:17.946]  Our super high quality nascent iodine
[00:32:18.166 --> 00:32:24.390]  Is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99% ultra pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:32.154]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue, and organ in the body.
[00:32:32.154 --> 00:32:39.058]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain, and overall brain fog.
[00:32:39.438 --> 00:32:45.663]  Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.
[00:32:45.663 --> 00:32:49.486]  Take control of your chemistry today with this super combo.
[00:32:49.486 --> 00:33:01.935]  Discover the power of Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:33:01.935 --> 00:33:04.557]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.219 --> 00:33:32.786]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:46.135 --> 00:33:48.776]  Well, Charlie Manson's dead.
[00:33:48.776 --> 00:33:50.737]  And his death gives us a window.
[00:33:50.737 --> 00:33:59.021]  And his life gives us a window into how the globalists operate and what their program is.
[00:33:59.021 --> 00:34:14.608]  And if you go back to, again, ancient Japan, just with sex and opium, they had different schools of assassins where people would volunteer to want to be part of the different societies.
[00:34:14.608 --> 00:34:15.448]  One of them was the ninja.
[00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.211]  It's not just in Hollywood movies.
[00:34:18.211 --> 00:34:37.541]  Who would then go kill a high-profile target, after generally a decade of training after being accepted, and then would commit seppuku after they killed the person they were targeting, because then you couldn't tell who carried out the murder.
[00:34:37.541 --> 00:34:39.082]  Now that was with opium and sex.
[00:34:40.762 --> 00:34:56.494]  Can you imagine what the Luciferians, the psychopaths, can do with the high-tech drugs and now microchips and electroshock and things that are way, way, way, way, way past the things that have been declassified.
[00:34:56.494 --> 00:35:06.762]  Then they have hit TV shows like Stranger Things that takes real programs and exactly how they do it, telling folks you're doing a drug trial test and
[00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:18.960]  Nine months later, you know, they cut your baby out of you and say that it was a miscarriage and then induct your child into mind control from the day it's born.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:27.988]  Skinner and a bunch of these other top psychologists and psychiatrists famously would do things like raise their own kids in cages.
[00:35:32.239 --> 00:35:35.960]  But it was okay because it was called research.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:47.984]  And all it is is psychopaths and hundreds of different programs being funded to develop new technologies over the mind, over the body.
[00:35:47.984 --> 00:35:58.887]  And now you see how Pavlovian it is that, oh, when you get an update from Facebook or Twitter, there's a ding on your phone.
[00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:03.612]  And it's all been Pavlovianly tested.
[00:36:03.612 --> 00:36:10.854]  The perfect little ding, the perfect little vibration, the perfect colors, the way it's presented to give you a dopamine rush.
[00:36:10.854 --> 00:36:22.158]  And then the head engineers go on television and tell TED Talk, we're abusing people, we're mind controlling them, and this is only phase one.
[00:36:22.158 --> 00:36:24.199]  Why would they tell you that?
[00:36:24.199 --> 00:36:27.280]  It's not because they're so good.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.001]  It's because there's metaphysical rules they follow.
[00:36:31.698 --> 00:36:40.344]  Where they believe they have to tell you what they're doing to you, or karmically it comes back on them.
[00:36:40.344 --> 00:36:41.965]  So they will warn you.
[00:36:41.965 --> 00:36:46.128]  Hi, I'm Count Dracula.
[00:36:46.128 --> 00:36:47.730]  Can you invite me into your house?
[00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:53.974]  You know, you really shouldn't invite people in you don't know, but would you invite me in?
[00:36:53.974 --> 00:36:57.197]  Well sure, you seem like a nice fella.
[00:36:57.197 --> 00:36:58.437]  What twinkly eyes you have.
[00:36:58.437 --> 00:36:58.878]  Come on in.
[00:37:00.171 --> 00:37:03.692]  Now he can come back any time he wants.
[00:37:03.692 --> 00:37:14.134]  That's why there's all these articles admitting screen time is mesmerizing you, screen time is lowering your IQ, screen time is putting you into a mesmerized, close to sleep state.
[00:37:14.134 --> 00:37:16.715]  Oh, there's all these big mainstream articles.
[00:37:16.715 --> 00:37:21.576]  5YG, 5G, all this stuff is literally frying.
[00:37:21.576 --> 00:37:23.737]  It definitely gives you cancer, but it's okay.
[00:37:24.704 --> 00:37:26.125]  We're going to put them in every classroom.
[00:37:26.125 --> 00:37:27.446]  We're going to put them in your house.
[00:37:27.446 --> 00:37:34.251]  We're going to put them in all the new appliances, in all the new cars, where you won't have a choice!
[00:37:34.251 --> 00:37:35.852]  And we're going to track you in real time.
[00:37:35.852 --> 00:37:36.933]  We're going to tax you.
[00:37:36.933 --> 00:37:38.034]  We're going to control you.
[00:37:38.034 --> 00:37:53.906]  And we're going to oscillate the 5G waves that DARPA, about 17 years ago, in the Baltimore Sun, just had the craziest article interviewing DARPA going, yeah, we're putting up towers in Maryland.
[00:37:55.194 --> 00:38:07.102]  Just on the cell towers, and that are going to send out some waves, some higher waves, higher powered waves, just testing, that could look at calming the public in the future.
[00:38:07.102 --> 00:38:14.687]  And the article went on, DARPA created the internet, they're good people, and the advanced laboratories, and that was a test.
[00:38:14.687 --> 00:38:23.413]  Put it in the newspaper, you open the newspaper up, one time they admitted they put oscillators in the cell towers
[00:38:27.793 --> 00:38:31.022]  They've got studies out on what you can do with these systems.
[00:38:31.022 --> 00:38:34.632]  Birds will just fall out of trees and won't care if ants eat them.
[00:38:34.632 --> 00:38:35.816]  They can make you just go to sleep.
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:40.481]  Flip the switch, everybody just, whoa, lies down.
[00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:42.941]  You don't think the Pentagon doesn't want those type of weapons?
[00:38:42.941 --> 00:38:48.622]  And you don't think the globalists that put fluoride in the water and all the rest of the stuff to hurt us wouldn't use that?
[00:38:48.622 --> 00:38:59.485]  They know we know about fluoride now, and the adjuvants in the water, and they're moving away from that program, because they know most of you are filtering your water, and they're going to electromagnetic.
[00:38:59.485 --> 00:39:05.246]  Just like Dr. Nick Begich just said, and we should get back on the show very, very soon, he said, forget the chemicals, Alex, that's the child's play.
[00:39:07.574 --> 00:39:10.535]  Because they have to, you know, get into your body.
[00:39:10.535 --> 00:39:13.456]  They're going with 5G technology.
[00:39:13.456 --> 00:39:16.837]  He said this 15 years ago.
[00:39:16.837 --> 00:39:20.618]  But don't worry, LA Times just says slight increase in tumors.
[00:39:20.618 --> 00:39:25.219]  No big deal.
[00:39:25.219 --> 00:39:29.921]  Slight my butt.
[00:39:29.921 --> 00:39:35.563]  3G is so strong that it can look through walls when it's bouncing back at its receiver.
[00:39:35.563 --> 00:39:36.463]  5G can give you
[00:39:37.844 --> 00:39:41.527]  Total color through multiple structures.
[00:39:41.527 --> 00:39:45.530]  And it's been on helicopters for decades, flying around looking through your walls.
[00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:50.414]  They had particle beams 30 years ago mounted on helicopters, flying around frying people.
[00:39:50.414 --> 00:39:53.556]  They used it in the Panama attack.
[00:39:53.556 --> 00:39:55.298]  They got everything.
[00:39:55.298 --> 00:39:57.780]  And there's this whole walled-off civilization
[00:40:03.559 --> 00:40:11.446]  Now is growing to the point of emerging and when the global government emerges, when this emerges, that means everybody starts dying.
[00:40:11.446 --> 00:40:19.152]  See, it's been built, siphoning off our resources, taking control of us, dumbing us down, playing us off against each other for decades and decades and decades.
[00:40:19.152 --> 00:40:22.615]  But now, it's going to the point where it's about to be born.
[00:40:24.505 --> 00:40:31.671]  And just like an alien from the movie Alien, it's been laid in your stomach, it's been feeding off you inside, now when it comes out, you die.
[00:40:31.671 --> 00:40:32.412]  We die.
[00:40:32.412 --> 00:40:34.194]  When it's born, we die.
[00:40:34.194 --> 00:40:36.035]  That's their religion.
[00:40:36.035 --> 00:40:41.240]  We have to die before they can have their new age world government.
[00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.611]  Oh, what comes after smartphones?
[00:40:49.611 --> 00:40:51.591]  Brain implants, maybe.
[00:40:51.591 --> 00:40:52.772]  See, mainstream news.
[00:40:52.772 --> 00:41:06.976]  They've gone from, it'll never happen, Alex Jones is insane, there's no DARPA plan to do it, to it's been done to over 10,000 troops, they admit so far, and now they're saying, hey, just get a chip, it's quick, it's easy, and my uncle has one.
[00:41:06.976 --> 00:41:11.418]  And it helps him not have epilepsy from a motorcycle accident.
[00:41:15.998 --> 00:41:18.199]  But the point is, it's all Trojan-horsed.
[00:41:18.199 --> 00:41:19.560]  It's all first-gen.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.580]  It's all being deployed by the globalists.
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:30.664]  We're going to go to break, come back, and play the Charlie Manson clips.
[00:41:30.664 --> 00:41:31.745]  We have a bunch of guests coming on.
[00:41:32.998 --> 00:41:34.619]  But that's what this is all about.
[00:41:34.619 --> 00:41:38.342]  And if you're conscious of the engineering, we can stop it together and be aware of it.
[00:41:38.342 --> 00:41:40.924]  But it's all being rolled out by the tech giants.
[00:41:40.924 --> 00:41:45.287]  They announced this weekend they're going to have a one world religion based on worshiping AI.
[00:41:45.287 --> 00:41:46.748]  And everyone will have to submit to it.
[00:41:46.748 --> 00:41:50.510]  Other religions will be banned.
[00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:55.254]  You can't criticize any other religion and you've got to just make them all one big thing.
[00:41:55.254 --> 00:41:56.695]  Just like they tell you in the movie Tron.
[00:41:56.695 --> 00:41:58.876]  Everything is them telling you.
[00:41:58.876 --> 00:42:01.318]  The big giant mainframe and it's grabbing in all of the programs.
[00:42:02.861 --> 00:42:07.565]  Put him on the grid, let him play for a while, and then blow him away.
[00:42:07.565 --> 00:42:14.150]  There's something different about this one.
[00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:19.414]  The new church of the AI God is even creepier than I imagined, CNET says.
[00:42:19.414 --> 00:42:21.416]  What did Elon Musk warn you in the last few months?
[00:42:21.416 --> 00:42:25.239]  He goes, watch out for tech leaders coming out and saying AI gods.
[00:42:25.239 --> 00:42:26.380]  I can't get into it.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.501]  I've signed non-disclosures, but it's dangerous!
[00:42:28.501 --> 00:42:29.542]  We're all in danger!
[00:42:29.542 --> 00:42:30.223]  We're all in danger!
[00:42:31.138 --> 00:42:34.942]  And the left's like, I can't wait to marriage with him.
[00:42:34.942 --> 00:42:37.484]  Now don't say mother and father.
[00:42:37.484 --> 00:42:38.745]  Masculinity's bad.
[00:42:38.745 --> 00:42:41.928]  It's literally, be weak.
[00:42:41.928 --> 00:42:43.069]  Be weak.
[00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:44.831]  You will assimilate.
[00:42:44.831 --> 00:42:46.492]  You will assimilate.
[00:42:46.492 --> 00:42:47.593]  Resistance is futile.
[00:42:47.593 --> 00:42:49.075]  Resistance is futile.
[00:42:49.075 --> 00:42:51.277]  They're just telling you.
[00:42:51.277 --> 00:42:55.180]  And then their minions look like meth-head Charlie Mansons that can't talk.
[00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:55.761]  They're slaves.
[00:42:57.355 --> 00:43:08.822]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[00:43:08.822 --> 00:43:17.747]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better, and then the other two is a
[00:43:17.967 --> 00:43:26.701]  Powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[00:43:26.701 --> 00:43:31.729]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable Floralife Everyday Maintenance.
[00:43:31.729 --> 00:43:32.630]  But all of these...
[00:43:33.431 --> 00:43:41.996]  ...are the very cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.

[00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:01.013]  America is an information-based civil war.
[00:44:01.013 --> 00:44:08.462]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[00:44:08.462 --> 00:44:13.988]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[00:44:14.788 --> 00:44:22.493]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:30.379]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[00:44:31.079 --> 00:44:36.163]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[00:44:36.163 --> 00:44:38.305]  They are the anti-liberals.
[00:44:38.305 --> 00:44:51.675]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:47:01.042 --> 00:47:03.683]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:23.391 --> 00:47:30.197]  I love this song.
[00:47:30.197 --> 00:47:30.657]  That's right.
[00:47:30.657 --> 00:47:32.118]  Give me liberty or give me death.
[00:47:32.118 --> 00:47:33.299]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:47:33.299 --> 00:47:36.582]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:47:36.582 --> 00:47:38.464]  Okay, let me get right back into the news.
[00:47:38.464 --> 00:47:52.155]  So, the scientific elite, starting in the 1850s in Britain, with the main governing system of the world at that time being the British Empire, made the decision
[00:47:55.967 --> 00:47:58.568]  To establish world government.
[00:47:58.568 --> 00:48:00.668]  True world government, not just empire.
[00:48:00.668 --> 00:48:07.150]  And they decided to use science to do it and always be so ahead of everybody else that they couldn't be defeated.
[00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:14.051]  Not just militarily, but culturally.
[00:48:14.051 --> 00:48:17.292]  Where there aren't any families anymore.
[00:48:17.292 --> 00:48:20.813]  People are programmable.
[00:48:20.813 --> 00:48:22.233]  That's the final revolution
[00:48:23.399 --> 00:48:26.121]  Is what the globalist technocrats call it.
[00:48:26.121 --> 00:48:30.184]  And they've written books, they've written white papers, they have conferences.
[00:48:30.184 --> 00:48:39.150]  They had a consensus 160 years ago.
[00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:52.299]  This plan was publicly launched 170-something years ago, and they had a consensus just a decade later.
[00:48:53.246 --> 00:48:55.427]  And so, that's why I'm so frustrated.
[00:48:55.427 --> 00:48:59.269]  What I'm telling you is what they've said.
[00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:11.715]  That's why when you hear Charlie Manson, you go, that sounds like Ted Turner, or that sounds like Bill Clinton, or that sounds like Al Gore, or that sounds like Lord Rothschild, or that sounds like Prince Philip, or that sounds like Prince Charles, because that's what their religion is.
[00:49:11.715 --> 00:49:15.937]  You're animals, you need to die, there's too many people.
[00:49:15.937 --> 00:49:21.540]  But then they grease the skids to make us as dumbed down as possible, to make that a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:26.087]  And they drug us, and they poison us, and they do everything they can.
[00:49:26.087 --> 00:49:29.209]  Paul Watson has the article on Infowars.com.
[00:49:29.209 --> 00:49:35.932]  Charles Manson, the eco-warrior who wanted to kill humans to save the Earth.
[00:49:35.932 --> 00:49:40.714]  Notorious cult leader wanted to wipe out 50 million to stop the polar ice caps melting.
[00:49:40.714 --> 00:49:42.575]  Remember the global warming Al Gore stuff?
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:49.061]  This was all on the universities then when nobody else had even heard it yet.
[00:49:49.061 --> 00:50:01.065]  It was a cosmology they were formulating and they were drugging the best minds of the best families coming in into a new age cult, they thought, of the Christ energy.
[00:50:01.065 --> 00:50:09.188]  And right behind that was a bunch of social engineering psychotics that just like to sacrifice people, have sex with the best looking women, and be pedophiles.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:19.245]  But you saw what happened to Roman Polanski's wife when he wasn't off raping little kids.
[00:50:19.245 --> 00:50:20.886]  Charlie Manson dropped by to kill her.
[00:50:20.886 --> 00:50:27.971]  Because she was their golden girl, Sharon Tate.
[00:50:27.971 --> 00:50:28.631]  I've researched it.
[00:50:28.631 --> 00:50:30.052]  They loved her, boy.
[00:50:30.052 --> 00:50:35.096]  The Illuminati loved her.
[00:50:35.096 --> 00:50:35.716]  Loved her a lot.
[00:50:42.018 --> 00:50:42.139]  So...
[00:50:43.615 --> 00:50:44.796]  That's what this is all about.
[00:50:44.796 --> 00:50:54.282]  And if you want this type of scum running your life, then go ahead and drink the fluoride, take the microchips, give your kids the smartphones all day, because this is their plan.
[00:50:54.282 --> 00:50:55.643]  They're carrying it out.
[00:50:55.643 --> 00:50:57.084]  They are executing it.
[00:50:57.084 --> 00:51:02.688]  A satanic, one-world government, computer-run system where it's illegal to be a Christian.
[00:51:02.688 --> 00:51:05.530]  They said that in five or six publications yesterday.
[00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:10.593]  They said, oh, the new AI God, it'll be against the law to be superstitious or believe in imaginary gods.
[00:51:10.593 --> 00:51:13.515]  You're gonna worship our AI or you're gonna die!
[00:51:13.575 --> 00:51:15.816]  Why?
[00:51:15.816 --> 00:51:19.619]  And it's going to run your life!
[00:51:19.619 --> 00:51:24.882]  Oh, but this young tech guy whose family was CIA and whose family were U.S.
[00:51:24.882 --> 00:51:32.887]  diplomats, he just went decades ago and won an award with DARPA and then went to work for Google.
[00:51:32.887 --> 00:51:34.908]  That's the guy who's behind the new AI cult.
[00:51:34.908 --> 00:51:36.209]  Same story with Zuckerberg.
[00:51:36.209 --> 00:51:41.773]  I mean, they're just front men to make it, look, oh, our little American whiz kid just came up with this.
[00:51:43.663 --> 00:51:54.893]  You know they got Charlie Manson's to pass out the drugs and then they got the Zuckerberg's to make it all cool and fun at the universities like something he came up with when it's all run by these people.
[00:51:54.893 --> 00:52:07.225]  So there's a lot of these clips and they're posted on InfoWars.com in Paul Watson's powerful article but you've heard all this before from Alan Gore and everybody else but here it is from Charles Manson
[00:52:09.022 --> 00:52:11.344]  Charles Manson, Geraldo Rivera.
[00:52:11.344 --> 00:52:13.286]  Here's an interview from back in the 80s.
[00:52:13.286 --> 00:52:19.010]  You can find Manson saying this stuff in court, you know, in 1970, 1971 when he was convicted.
[00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.631]  Where was he getting it?
[00:52:19.631 --> 00:52:25.275]  Well, he was hanging out in the same college as Theodore Kaczynski in the MKUltra program.
[00:52:25.275 --> 00:52:27.938]  They admit he was in the MKUltra program, folks.
[00:52:27.938 --> 00:52:28.718]  So, here it is.
[00:52:28.718 --> 00:52:29.219]  Charles Manson.
[00:52:30.189 --> 00:52:32.211]  No, reality is they did what they did.
[00:52:32.211 --> 00:52:34.052]  They're responsible for their own actions.
[00:52:34.052 --> 00:52:35.853]  I'm responsible for my actions.
[00:52:35.853 --> 00:52:37.174]  Ever kill anybody?
[00:52:37.174 --> 00:52:38.695]  I've come off a close few times.
[00:52:38.695 --> 00:52:39.796]  Come on, didn't you, John?
[00:52:39.796 --> 00:52:41.598]  What do you mean, come on, didn't you, man?
[00:52:41.598 --> 00:52:42.618]  I ain't lying to you.
[00:52:42.618 --> 00:52:45.380]  If you think I'm lying to you, you're wasting my time and your time.
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.001]  Okay, let's not lie.
[00:52:46.001 --> 00:52:46.341]  Let's be cool.
[00:52:46.341 --> 00:52:47.182]  There's no reason to.
[00:52:47.182 --> 00:52:47.782]  Let's be straight.
[00:52:47.782 --> 00:52:48.643]  There's no reason to.
[00:52:48.643 --> 00:52:49.984]  Why are you guilty of that?
[00:52:49.984 --> 00:52:50.444]  I'm guilty of...
[00:52:52.032 --> 00:52:53.612]  What am I guilty of?
[00:52:53.612 --> 00:52:56.713]  I'm guilty of thinking that I had rights in a courtroom.
[00:52:56.713 --> 00:52:58.774]  That's what I'm guilty of thinking.
[00:52:58.774 --> 00:53:03.535]  When my father's died and all them other wars, I thought, man, I'd just stand in the courtroom and tell the judge.
[00:53:03.535 --> 00:53:05.515]  It'd be all over, 15, 20 minutes.
[00:53:05.515 --> 00:53:06.035]  I'm busy.
[00:53:06.035 --> 00:53:07.936]  I got some appointments.
[00:53:07.936 --> 00:53:09.576]  And it started making money.
[00:53:09.576 --> 00:53:13.417]  And when it started making money, whoa, money takes presidents.
[00:53:14.057 --> 00:53:16.219]  They're going to put me down on the ground for the money.
[00:53:16.219 --> 00:53:18.802]  As long as they make the money, they don't care who did it.
[00:53:18.802 --> 00:53:20.363]  Who did it is not important.
[00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:25.008]  And if I had have done it, it would be worse than if I hadn't.
[00:53:25.008 --> 00:53:25.588]  Consider.
[00:53:25.588 --> 00:53:26.629]  I don't understand.
[00:53:26.629 --> 00:53:27.630]  Well, consider.
[00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:28.931]  I tell you like this.
[00:53:28.931 --> 00:53:31.574]  Yeah, I chopped up nine hogs.
[00:53:32.094 --> 00:53:34.255]  And I'm going to chop up some more of you motherf**kers.
[00:53:34.255 --> 00:53:35.955]  I'm going to kill you as many as I can.
[00:53:35.955 --> 00:53:37.936]  I'm going to pile you up to the sky.
[00:53:37.936 --> 00:53:39.176]  I'm figuring about 50 million.
[00:53:39.176 --> 00:53:44.937]  If I can get about 50 million of you, I might be able to save my trees, and my air, and my water, and my wildlife.
[00:53:44.937 --> 00:53:46.858]  Do I kill 50 million people?
[00:53:46.858 --> 00:53:50.619]  Well, that's just a drop in the bucket of what's really coming.
[00:53:50.619 --> 00:53:54.060]  Yeah, that's just a drop in the bucket of what's really coming.
[00:53:56.681 --> 00:53:57.622]  Yeah, we know.
[00:53:57.622 --> 00:53:59.985]  Bioweapon, plague releases, you name it.
[00:53:59.985 --> 00:54:04.530]  You've got electromagnetic sensors, you can flip the switch, people will just go to sleep.
[00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:07.874]  There'll be a bunch of skeletons they gotta come in in a few months to clean up.
[00:54:10.145 --> 00:54:14.806]  They'll just have to secure the nuclear reactors and some of those other facilities, and they're gearing up for that.
[00:54:14.806 --> 00:54:16.326]  They're gearing up for it.
[00:54:16.326 --> 00:54:26.888]  So just know, if we can't stop them, and you're seeing a billion die in one week, and nuclear war starts and a bunch of stuff kicks off, know, they did it all, they're in their bunkers, and you know what?
[00:54:26.888 --> 00:54:28.468]  You deserved it.
[00:54:28.468 --> 00:54:31.149]  Because they've been gearing up, they've been getting ready, and what did he say?
[00:54:31.149 --> 00:54:35.730]  He said Europeans are evil, Europeans are bad, Europeans have to be done away with.
[00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:36.810]  What do the globalists say today?
[00:54:38.834 --> 00:54:42.777]  That's just dominant globalist Europeans wanting to get rid of their competition.
[00:54:42.777 --> 00:54:44.018]  It's helter-skelter.
[00:54:44.018 --> 00:54:46.219]  They want global race war.
[00:54:46.219 --> 00:54:56.427]  And they want to put Europeans back up against the wall, getting a bunch of outside groups trying to kill them, so a lot of the Europeans will then accept the extermination program that's going to kill everybody who isn't white.
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:04.101]  And you've got the Asian groups and folks working with the globalists, deciding who's going to be on what team.
[00:55:04.101 --> 00:55:08.302]  You've got the Chinese developing race-specific bioweapons, and that's all aimed at us.
[00:55:08.302 --> 00:55:11.383]  This is serious business!
[00:55:11.383 --> 00:55:12.723]  And I've got a bunch of other clips.
[00:55:12.723 --> 00:55:14.344]  Charles Manson, global warming.
[00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:16.224]  Charles Manson, interview.
[00:55:16.224 --> 00:55:18.445]  I should have killed 500 people.
[00:55:18.445 --> 00:55:20.705]  Charles Manson, let's stop polluting.
[00:55:20.705 --> 00:55:23.466]  Charles Manson says he wants to have a one-world government.
[00:55:24.445 --> 00:55:28.226]  Let's play the Charles Manson wants a one world government.
[00:55:28.226 --> 00:55:29.606]  Then I'll come back and play more of these clips.
[00:55:29.606 --> 00:55:30.106]  Here it is.
[00:55:30.106 --> 00:55:31.947]  Charles Manson wants a one world government.
[00:55:31.947 --> 00:55:32.967]  Here it is.
[00:55:32.967 --> 00:55:34.988]  Man doesn't back up to his fear.
[00:55:34.988 --> 00:55:36.728]  He goes straight into his fear.
[00:55:36.728 --> 00:55:39.969]  We've got to get a one world government.
[00:55:39.969 --> 00:55:42.049]  We've got to have it.
[00:55:46.018 --> 00:55:54.664]  This is just the bombed out little drug delivery guy, the CIA, who heard all this, you know, the Satan orgies, and is now up here being our guru.
[00:55:54.664 --> 00:55:56.265]  He's just repeating it.
[00:55:56.265 --> 00:55:57.206]  When what's he look like?
[00:55:57.206 --> 00:55:58.547]  An inbred meth head.
[00:55:58.547 --> 00:56:00.608]  He looks like an antifa, doesn't he?
[00:56:00.608 --> 00:56:03.991]  We're going to come back with more of these clips, ladies and gentlemen, but this is who we're facing.
[00:56:03.991 --> 00:56:06.592]  This is who we're dealing with, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:06.592 --> 00:56:08.114]  Now, before I go any further,
[00:56:09.136 --> 00:56:11.937]  If you don't financially support us, Soros will win.
[00:56:11.937 --> 00:56:13.557]  Plus, we got great products you really need.
[00:56:13.557 --> 00:56:15.877]  That's the real reason you should get them.
[00:56:15.877 --> 00:56:19.358]  And we're launching, as we do every year, gigantic specials.
[00:56:19.358 --> 00:56:22.519]  We have our biggest specials around Christmas and around Black Friday every year.
[00:56:22.519 --> 00:56:24.319]  This is free shipping, just extended.
[00:56:24.319 --> 00:56:25.979]  People love the free shipping.
[00:56:25.979 --> 00:56:29.100]  So I'm doing it for another week at least.
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.500]  But that's not really what's important here.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.261]  We're going to have a 34-hour live broadcast next week again.
[00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:38.031]  Because Vice and others didn't like that, so we're going to do another one.
[00:56:38.031 --> 00:56:38.831]  It was very popular.
[00:56:38.831 --> 00:56:43.693]  Got about a million and a half new listeners and viewers during that, so it's very, very successful to reach out to new people.
[00:56:43.693 --> 00:56:47.015]  We're going to start doing those since they don't like them and try to demoralize us.
[00:56:47.015 --> 00:56:48.135]  That's coming up on Monday.
[00:56:48.135 --> 00:56:54.538]  But this week we got 50% off, but these sales are only going to run each item for a couple days because a bunch of them are close to selling out.
[00:56:54.538 --> 00:56:57.299]  Like I told you, Knockout was sold out for a few weeks.
[00:56:57.299 --> 00:56:58.339]  We had it back to full price.
[00:56:58.339 --> 00:56:59.760]  We got a small shipment in.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.601]  Should get more in the middle of December, but our
[00:57:02.521 --> 00:57:04.262]  Great high-quality product is back.
[00:57:04.262 --> 00:57:06.862]  Same thing happened with the BrainForce.
[00:57:06.862 --> 00:57:10.343]  It's 50% off and again free shipping.
[00:57:10.343 --> 00:57:13.364]  ProPure 25% off and free shipping.
[00:57:13.364 --> 00:57:16.105]  Super high-quality water filtration system.
[00:57:16.105 --> 00:57:16.765]  It's all there.
[00:57:16.765 --> 00:57:22.907]  Also Carnivorbe, our new digestive enzyme, top of the line when you're eating all that turkey and beef and the rest of it to actually help absorb it.
[00:57:23.507 --> 00:57:29.392]  Not have it rot in your guts and actually get the protein and micronutrients and macronutrients from it.
[00:57:29.392 --> 00:57:30.834]  33% off introductory price.
[00:57:30.834 --> 00:57:35.498]  And our new Floralife, a digestive probiotic formula, is top of the line.
[00:57:35.498 --> 00:57:41.343]  We have two different dosages of that at infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:41.343 --> 00:57:43.705]  We're committed to you.
[00:57:43.705 --> 00:57:45.667]  When you buy these products, you're committed to us and we win.
[00:57:47.558 --> 00:57:49.158]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:58:27.936 --> 00:58:29.978]  And this part is most important.

[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:36.782]  Plant-derived, or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:58:36.782 --> 00:58:38.223]  That means it's clean.
[00:58:38.223 --> 00:58:39.344]  That means it's pure.
[00:58:39.344 --> 00:58:42.245]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[00:58:42.245 --> 00:58:45.047]  That's InfowarsWipes.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:59:50.476 --> 00:59:53.158]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:11.931]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:11.931 --> 01:00:22.895]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.895 --> 01:00:27.017]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:27.017 --> 01:00:35.900]  I have a special guest coming on, dealing with white genocide in Africa that's even in mainstream news, that the left is actually praising.
[01:00:37.526 --> 01:00:40.068]  So Simon Roche is coming on the broadcast.
[01:00:40.068 --> 01:00:47.052]  We're going to be looking at Mugabe out in Zimbabwe and so much more.
[01:00:47.052 --> 01:00:52.136]  But right now we're getting into Charles Manson, dead at 83.
[01:00:52.136 --> 01:00:59.961]  And I just played clips, if you just joined us, of him saying, I want to kill 50 million, then I would have been a good globalist.
[01:00:59.961 --> 01:01:01.462]  But don't worry, a lot more is coming soon.
[01:01:02.554 --> 01:01:06.995]  They all dream of the big catastrophe, the mass death, and the new world they're going to have.
[01:01:06.995 --> 01:01:09.916]  We play the clip of him wanting a one-world government.
[01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:14.177]  Here he is talking about man-made global warming in 1987.
[01:01:14.177 --> 01:01:16.178]  Here's Charles Manson.
[01:01:16.178 --> 01:01:19.279]  I tried to stop the Vietnam War and I did it.
[01:01:19.279 --> 01:01:23.640]  And all the things I did, I did without breaking the law.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.940]  Because your law is 1776.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:28.881]  You've got jet airplanes going 6,000 miles an hour.
[01:01:28.881 --> 01:01:31.722]  And you're reading books that were written on the back of horses.
[01:01:32.342 --> 01:01:34.804]  Why don't you tell the public what's really going on?
[01:01:34.804 --> 01:01:37.867]  Why don't you tell them the water is so bad the fish can't live in it?
[01:01:37.867 --> 01:01:42.472]  Why don't you tell them that the polar caps are melting because you're creating so much heat with this machine?
[01:01:42.472 --> 01:01:44.153]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:01:44.153 --> 01:01:44.794]  1987 interview.
[01:01:44.794 --> 01:01:49.979]  He steadfastly refused to admit guilt or show any remorse for his actions.
[01:01:50.579 --> 01:01:55.524]  You won't face the fact that there's a holy war moving upon the planet Earth.
[01:01:55.524 --> 01:01:58.947]  You couldn't see the blood splattered all over the walls.
[01:01:58.947 --> 01:02:01.369]  Now you say you want to blame one guy for it.
[01:02:01.369 --> 01:02:02.370]  I've seen it.
[01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:04.492]  I witnessed it go by.
[01:02:04.492 --> 01:02:08.416]  I've seen the children, what they were trying to do, and I was sympathetic with them.
[01:02:09.216 --> 01:02:18.422]  But you might say I'm a devil in this respect, that I never broke will or entered into anyone's circle with breaking will in any respect whatsoever.
[01:02:18.422 --> 01:02:21.765]  I just watched this sh** flow downstream.
[01:02:21.765 --> 01:02:31.971]  From your words, as Mr. Emmons quotes them in this book, it's clear that you were guilty of murder, and yet he says in all his conversations with you, he never heard you express remorse.
[01:02:31.971 --> 01:02:32.792]  Have you never felt it?
[01:02:33.292 --> 01:02:34.793]  Remorseful for what?
[01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:37.695]  You people have done everything in the world to me.
[01:02:37.695 --> 01:02:40.116]  Doesn't that give me equal right?
[01:02:40.116 --> 01:02:43.258]  I can do anything I want to you people at any time I want to.
[01:02:43.258 --> 01:02:45.719]  Because that's what you've done to me.
[01:02:45.719 --> 01:02:53.443]  If you spit in my face and smack me in the mouth and throw me in solitary confinement for nothing, what do you think's gonna happen when I get out of here?
[01:02:53.443 --> 01:02:54.924]  What do you think's gonna happen to you?
[01:02:54.924 --> 01:02:59.006]  The things that you create in here.
[01:02:59.006 --> 01:02:59.887]  So, there you go.
[01:03:01.587 --> 01:03:13.313]  If you go out on the street and look at the Antifa people, or you look at the average leftist at the Hillary event that we just sent a nice reporter out to cover, and they were in her face, screaming at her, attacking her, flipping her off, grabbing the microphone.
[01:03:13.313 --> 01:03:19.517]  They all have that trashiness to them, that stupidity to them, that glaze in their eyes.
[01:03:19.517 --> 01:03:20.477]  There's nothing there.
[01:03:20.477 --> 01:03:24.379]  They're just kind of broadcasting the corrupt spirit of the world.
[01:03:24.379 --> 01:03:25.220]  They're not themselves.
[01:03:27.827 --> 01:03:32.169]  And you notice that people like Charles Manson says I can do whatever I want.
[01:03:32.169 --> 01:03:33.390]  He's saying he's one of the elite.
[01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:36.091]  He can kill whoever he wants.
[01:03:36.091 --> 01:03:43.175]  He can stab and murder whoever he wants because he's Charles Manson.
[01:03:43.175 --> 01:03:47.577]  And then he points out though, well you guys have done a lot more than I've done.
[01:03:47.577 --> 01:03:48.838]  He's talking about the power structure.
[01:03:50.839 --> 01:03:51.980]  Itself.
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:04:05.949]  But the truth is, Charles Manson learned about all this stuff because he was hanging around on those universities where the CIA mind control programs were going on and he was recruited into it to be one of the bag men.
[01:04:05.949 --> 01:04:08.831]  And that's come out in congressional hearings, that's come out in the research.
[01:04:08.831 --> 01:04:18.798]  They had tons of these guys all over the country and all over the world to create this new counterculture that looked cool to get all the young people to adopt a program
[01:04:20.259 --> 01:04:23.683]  of counterculture that the social engineers have come up with.
[01:04:23.683 --> 01:04:33.673]  And now, after the free love and the sex and the partying, now it's, oh, the sex is bad, mothers and fathers are bad, humans are bad, here, just take this brain chip.
[01:04:33.673 --> 01:04:35.615]  They're moving us on to the next phase.
[01:04:35.615 --> 01:04:43.343]  And I've seen government documents, some of them are in Charlotte Isserby's deliberate dumbing down from the Department of Education, where it actually shows graphics
[01:04:44.522 --> 01:04:53.734]  I thought they first make you rebellious and then they turn you into this, into that, and finally you're a zombie on the other end, basically under their control.
[01:04:53.734 --> 01:04:54.735]  So it's a whole process.
[01:04:56.727 --> 01:05:04.994]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[01:05:04.994 --> 01:05:06.215]  A 360 win.
[01:05:06.215 --> 01:05:12.780]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:20.306]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:05:20.686 --> 01:05:25.769]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:05:25.769 --> 01:05:31.873]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:05:31.873 --> 01:05:39.679]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:05:39.679 --> 01:05:46.543]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature in InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:47.684]  10% off on auto ship.
[01:05:47.844 --> 01:05:50.265]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[01:05:50.265 --> 01:05:52.246]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[01:05:52.246 --> 01:06:01.971]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:06:01.971 --> 01:06:15.978]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:31.957 --> 01:06:39.759]  Ladies and gentlemen, Hollywood Babylon has absolutely poisoned our country and poisoned the world.
[01:06:39.759 --> 01:06:53.221]  It has been a weaponized culture system to attack families, to attack civilization, to attack our sovereignty, and now it's in a lot of trouble imploding in on itself.
[01:06:53.221 --> 01:06:57.202]  Charles Manson is dead, part of an MKUltra mind control program.
[01:06:59.104 --> 01:07:01.406]  We're going to be talking about that more coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:07:01.406 --> 01:07:08.751]  Also, Google launches colossal censorship and disinformation campaign under the dead of night.
[01:07:08.751 --> 01:07:15.977]  Men's shaving company attacks toxic masculinity and new ad says being strong, being honorable, being stoic is bad.
[01:07:15.977 --> 01:07:17.258]  Stop it.
[01:07:17.258 --> 01:07:19.399]  This is the total demoralization.
[01:07:19.399 --> 01:07:22.462]  And then the big news that I'm going to cover again after our guest leaves us.
[01:07:25.197 --> 01:07:31.700]  Experts were predicting over the weekend a great crash of 2018 will start in the bond market.
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:43.347]  Today, the Euro crashed massively with Angela Merkel's fourth term as Chancellor in doubt and her plan to flood Europe with Islamists as US growth forecaster on the rise.
[01:07:43.347 --> 01:07:51.651]  I've talked to top globalists on-air and off-air, former top globalists, and I've been in contact with other, over the years, people that are high up, billionaires, you name it.
[01:07:52.964 --> 01:07:59.487]  And they filled me in on a lot of things saying that I was basically dead on about what was happening and who had told me, well I could just see it.
[01:07:59.487 --> 01:08:08.972]  It really isn't in the news, but you can follow the trends and the different angles.
[01:08:08.972 --> 01:08:19.558]  The globalists made a deal with the Euro and with China to de-industrialize the US as a political system of control and implode us and turn us into a third world country, just like they've done to South Africa.
[01:08:22.253 --> 01:08:24.994]  And Trump and others are battling that.
[01:08:24.994 --> 01:08:33.039]  And so it's not just like, hey, we're fighting to get the economy up and keep the stock market propped up as a bubble just because that's fun, because it is unhealthy long term.
[01:08:33.039 --> 01:08:34.839]  But we're in a financial war now.
[01:08:34.839 --> 01:08:45.245]  We have to keep it propped up until the euro implodes, because it's a cancerous authoritarian system that is opening the borders to carry out the cultural genocide against Christians and whites.
[01:08:46.092 --> 01:08:49.673]  And again, the minorities coming in aren't even the enemy.
[01:08:49.673 --> 01:08:54.513]  It's the globalists directing it all and they admit it.
[01:08:54.513 --> 01:09:01.135]  Now the reason this all dovetails in is because it's a planetary plan.
[01:09:01.135 --> 01:09:14.577]  And we have Simon Roche on, who is a prominent activist and individual who's been exposing the massive white genocide in South Africa, in Zimbabwe, in
[01:09:16.044 --> 01:09:25.838]  Many of these other African countries where everybody's now basically starving to death and they have epic Weimar Republic inflation because they've driven any infrastructure out.
[01:09:25.838 --> 01:09:27.541]  It's just a thing of conquest.
[01:09:29.161 --> 01:09:34.103]  So South Africans hold Black Monday protest over white farmer murders.
[01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:35.323]  That's Newsweek.
[01:09:35.323 --> 01:09:37.684]  Murders of white farmers spark protests in South Africa.
[01:09:37.684 --> 01:09:39.865]  That's CBS News.
[01:09:39.865 --> 01:09:45.486]  Epidemic of South African farm murders continues as gunmen shoot elderly victims dead.
[01:09:45.486 --> 01:09:50.288]  Now, these are groups of ANC-connected black communists doing it.
[01:09:50.288 --> 01:09:52.369]  So the whole Black Lives Matter thing is like international.
[01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:56.191]  And you've got a lot of other black groups saying, we don't want this, this is terrible.
[01:09:56.191 --> 01:09:58.893]  But look at Zimbabwe, and I'm not the expert like this gentleman.
[01:09:58.893 --> 01:10:04.976]  Zimbabwe, where you've got Robert Mugabe and all the rest of it, has basically killed all the white farmers.
[01:10:04.976 --> 01:10:05.537]  Tens of thousands.
[01:10:05.537 --> 01:10:06.677]  They're all gone.
[01:10:06.677 --> 01:10:09.619]  The few that stayed have all been killed.
[01:10:09.619 --> 01:10:10.300]  Okay?
[01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:19.986]  So, what you see in Zimbabwe is now going to be South Africa, and this is directed, this is planned, and we've got an expert on to go over
[01:10:21.823 --> 01:10:24.710]  That information for us.
[01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:29.803]  Simon Roche is head of the Office of HQ of the world's largest non-state civil defense organization.
[01:10:30.905 --> 01:10:33.167]  And I'm probably not going to pronounce it right.
[01:10:33.167 --> 01:10:41.252]  Sue Landers of South Africa, once an ANC activist, he now works tirelessly to prepare for impending catastrophe in the Rainbow Nation.
[01:10:41.252 --> 01:10:45.375]  Simon lives in Johannesburg and is the proud father of many children.
[01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:48.397]  And we'll probably have to keep him until 40 after or so if we can, because I've gotten a little bit late.
[01:10:48.397 --> 01:10:50.058]  This is so important to break down.
[01:10:50.058 --> 01:10:54.481]  We can also show how they first disarmed everybody and now they're able to kill them.
[01:10:54.481 --> 01:10:56.702]  And how the government basically goes along with this.
[01:10:56.702 --> 01:11:00.605]  So it's S-U-I-D-L-A-N-D-E-R-S.
[01:11:01.705 --> 01:11:03.106]  No, that's just about accurate.
[01:11:03.106 --> 01:11:04.526]  For a long time we've been
[01:11:29.578 --> 01:11:31.019]  Predicting these things.
[01:11:31.019 --> 01:11:33.781]  We're not hidebound by doctrine as many people are.
[01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:38.864]  You know, they're supposed to conform to the narrative of the New South African Rainbow Nation.
[01:11:38.864 --> 01:11:40.125]  Our organization, St.
[01:11:40.125 --> 01:11:48.390]  Londers, the largest of its kind in the world, as you said, operates on facts, statistics, data, true information.
[01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:50.331]  And it is very much the way that you've described.
[01:11:50.331 --> 01:11:55.354]  There's an ongoing decline in South Africa particularly, or Southern Africa.
[01:11:56.094 --> 01:12:00.256]  And it is indisputably driven by globalist capital forces.
[01:12:00.256 --> 01:12:04.377]  That's beyond any sort of doubt.
[01:12:04.377 --> 01:12:13.440]  We can go to your website to see examples of the carnage, the murder, the death, but for people that don't know, can you describe the forces in South Africa?
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:20.283]  Well, the South African political scene is dominated by the African National Congress government of Nelson Mandela fame.
[01:12:21.536 --> 01:12:43.703]  They are now challenged very heavily for their original political territory by a Leninist, Stalinist political party called the Economic Freedom Fighters, whose leader very famously in recent months has said that blacks should invade white farms with the spear in the hand.
[01:12:43.703 --> 01:12:47.065]  He's also the guy who said on the 7th of November last year that
[01:12:48.605 --> 01:12:51.447]  He's not calling for the slaughter of all whites yet.
[01:12:51.447 --> 01:13:01.352]  And as a very, very influential tribal leader in South Africa said to me, Simon, in English or European idiom, that could mean many things.
[01:13:01.352 --> 01:13:04.794]  In African idiom, that means only one thing.
[01:13:04.794 --> 01:13:11.938]  He's telling his supporters that at some point, but not now, he is going to call upon them to slaughter all of the whites.
[01:13:12.686 --> 01:13:15.847]  And they should prepare for it, whether people like that or not.
[01:13:15.847 --> 01:13:19.829]  That's that's the reality that we're facing at the moment.
[01:13:19.829 --> 01:13:21.149]  And it gets worse and worse.
[01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:22.970]  You know, the African National Congress, Alex.
[01:13:25.936 --> 01:13:31.037]  ...maintains its Mkonto Wesizwe, Spear of the Nation, armed wing.
[01:13:31.037 --> 01:13:39.038]  So it's probably the only political party in the world that, besides being the governing force and having a defence force, also has its armed wing.
[01:13:39.038 --> 01:13:54.421]  And the head of the armed wing, the Mkonto Wesizwe, in our largest, most populous province, said a few months ago that it is now time for young blacks to go to training camps in the bush, in South Africa, to learn to kill whites in a civil war.
[01:13:55.081 --> 01:14:10.636]  So those are the main parties, the extreme left party, the ANC, and then of course there's the minor white population of about eight and a half percent, and we believe that we are going to be on the receiving end of this.
[01:14:10.636 --> 01:14:15.861]  Now for those that again haven't studied the different topography in the different areas, you've got
[01:14:18.601 --> 01:14:39.552]  The quasi-communist government before, and I guess it's just getting more and more radicalized by its far left, and I read their own plans and their own statements, and the people being murdered every day now, and the riots and the looting of the infrastructure, and it sounds just like what Antifa and Black Lives Matter and the Soros-funded groups are doing over here.
[01:14:41.646 --> 01:14:42.447]  It's very similar.
[01:14:42.447 --> 01:14:43.828]  The similarities are terrific.
[01:14:43.828 --> 01:15:00.397]  I've just spent six months in the USA, going from one end to the other, over 27,000 miles worth of driving, visiting decent, respectable, bright-eyed, fresh-faced, very nice people, to talk with them about this problem and to endeavour to raise funds because we
[01:15:02.098 --> 01:15:07.663]  Very, very close to a crisis and we need to very urgently get whatever... We're going to talk about that.
[01:15:07.663 --> 01:15:08.844]  We're going to talk about your emergency.
[01:15:08.844 --> 01:15:14.369]  We're going to talk about your emergency plan because again, some people are just saying, hey, you should just leave.
[01:15:14.369 --> 01:15:16.451]  Well, a lot of people, you know, can't leave.
[01:15:16.451 --> 01:15:18.473]  A lot of countries won't take you.
[01:15:18.473 --> 01:15:24.538]  But I mean, explain what's happening there when we come back from break and the emergency plan, because as you said, already
[01:15:25.499 --> 01:15:27.461]  South Africa has one of the highest crime rates in the world.
[01:15:27.461 --> 01:15:28.662]  It's collapsing.
[01:15:28.662 --> 01:15:31.584]  The populations are just killing each other en masse.
[01:15:31.584 --> 01:15:35.587]  People believe if you rape a baby, if you have HIV, that it makes you well.
[01:15:35.587 --> 01:15:40.831]  I mean, it's just descending back into absolute barbarism.
[01:15:40.831 --> 01:15:43.894]  And I got to ask you, why not just evacuate?
[01:15:43.894 --> 01:15:45.135]  And then it's very sad.
[01:15:45.135 --> 01:15:47.056]  These folks will all just kill each other.
[01:15:47.056 --> 01:15:49.318]  For whatever reason, it's very, very sad.
[01:15:49.318 --> 01:15:50.078]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:50.459]  Stay with us.

[01:16:56.505 --> 01:16:58.965]  ID Stronghold wallets are different.
[01:16:58.965 --> 01:17:00.826]  They may look the same on the outside.
[01:17:00.826 --> 01:17:01.566]  They're stylish.

[01:17:06.207 --> 01:17:08.447]  No, there are no pyrotechnics.
[01:17:08.447 --> 01:17:10.828]  And it doesn't sing when you open it.
[01:17:10.828 --> 01:17:13.508]  But it does have magical powers.

[01:17:57.137 --> 01:17:58.618]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:17:58.618 --> 01:17:59.939]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:17:59.939 --> 01:18:01.140]  Why is this so good?
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:06.425]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:18:06.425 --> 01:18:19.978]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:18:19.978 --> 01:18:21.339]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:23.761]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:18:23.761 --> 01:18:26.322]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:18:26.322 --> 01:18:27.623]  These are all parasites.
[01:18:27.623 --> 01:18:28.723]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:18:28.723 --> 01:18:30.064]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:18:30.064 --> 01:18:34.566]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:18:34.566 --> 01:18:37.707]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[01:18:37.847 --> 01:18:40.889]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:18:40.889 --> 01:18:41.950]  It just came back in yesterday.

[01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:46.496]  It is an act of war.
[01:19:46.496 --> 01:19:48.037]  It is an act of standing up.
[01:19:48.037 --> 01:19:53.622]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[01:19:59.242 --> 01:20:01.858]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:17.475 --> 01:20:21.536]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:20:21.536 --> 01:20:25.677]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.677 --> 01:20:34.379]  Simon Roche is the head of the office of the HQ of the world's largest non-state civil defense organization in South Africa.
[01:20:34.379 --> 01:20:46.522]  And in many other countries, once communists take over or leftists take over, they slowly isolate the whites, put them basically in controlled areas, farm ghettos, and then start exterminating them.
[01:20:47.458 --> 01:20:49.599]  That's now accelerated in South Africa.
[01:20:49.599 --> 01:20:52.280]  It's been basically complete in Zimbabwe.
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.220]  Tens of thousands of whites killed.
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:56.681]  The leftist media in the West celebrates it.
[01:20:56.681 --> 01:20:58.042]  They teach at major universities.
[01:20:58.042 --> 01:20:58.962]  It's good.
[01:20:58.962 --> 01:21:09.866]  And now the second most powerful party in South Africa is set to take power, openly saying they will kill every white left 8% of the population in South Africa.
[01:21:10.586 --> 01:21:12.247]  Now, you can say, well, just get out of there.
[01:21:12.247 --> 01:21:15.548]  Well, a lot of Western countries won't take people out of South Africa.
[01:21:15.548 --> 01:21:20.529]  In fact, that's kind of a UN globalist thing, is they don't want whites going to nations that have whites.
[01:21:20.529 --> 01:21:26.371]  This is a globalist attack on whites run by elite whites in every case.
[01:21:26.371 --> 01:21:29.792]  So you have to ask yourself, flood countries with non-whites.
[01:21:30.572 --> 01:21:31.853]  And then say whites get out.
[01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:35.894]  Well you can argue, obviously Africa, whites colonize that.
[01:21:35.894 --> 01:21:42.957]  But the issue is globalists are now reverse colonizing using third world populations to flood first world nations to drive down wages.
[01:21:44.034 --> 01:21:45.355]  And then exploit those countries.
[01:21:45.355 --> 01:21:49.959]  So, once the whites are all out of South Africa, which has already happened in other countries, it's going to fully collapse.
[01:21:49.959 --> 01:21:51.040]  That's my view on it.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:57.786]  Talk about your emergency plan, Simon, and just how dire the situation is, and tell the folks here in the U.S.
[01:21:57.786 --> 01:22:06.094]  and around the world what it's like to be there, because I know they've taken most your guns in the last decade or so, and of course now that's accelerated the white genocide.
[01:22:07.839 --> 01:22:08.720]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:16.731]  The best source on this is Dr. Gregory Stanton of Genocide Watch of Washington, D.C., who's written extensively about this.
[01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:21.076]  And there's nobody in the world who compares to him as an expert on genocide.
[01:22:21.076 --> 01:22:24.681]  And he said that clearly we are heading towards an open genocide.
[01:22:26.486 --> 01:22:33.650]  I think that the key thing for people to understand, Alex, is the statistics rather than the sentiment, the opinion.
[01:22:33.650 --> 01:22:45.818]  The reality is that the chances of a white farmer in South Africa being murdered on his farm are more than double the chances of a policeman in this violent society being killed.
[01:22:46.338 --> 01:22:55.243]  Now, when a man who tills the soil stands more than twice the chance of a crime fighter in a violent society dying, then you know that there's something wrong.
[01:22:55.243 --> 01:23:09.531]  The statistical likelihood of a white person being murdered by a black person in South Africa is more than 12,000% higher than any black person in the USA ever stood of being lynched.
[01:23:09.531 --> 01:23:10.712]  We're not condoning lynching.
[01:23:10.712 --> 01:23:12.853]  We're saying get a sense of perspective people.
[01:23:12.853 --> 01:23:14.614]  The persecution of whites in Africa
[01:23:15.154 --> 01:23:22.619]  The persecution of whites in Africa is larger than persecution, statistically, that's been done to blacks in this country.
[01:23:22.619 --> 01:23:26.101]  By more than 12,000 percent, that's correct.
[01:23:26.101 --> 01:23:26.481]  Continue.
[01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:32.213]  Well, our national emergency plan is an entirely peaceful plan.
[01:23:32.213 --> 01:23:34.574]  We're non-insurrectionist, non-seditionist.
[01:23:34.574 --> 01:23:36.135]  We're not here to cause trouble.
[01:23:36.135 --> 01:23:43.420]  We're here to look after innocent women, children, and non-able-bodied people, and the elderly.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:56.649]  We're here in the event of an open civil war in this country, a race-based civil war, such as black leaders have been promising us, particularly since August of last year, when our former judge president said that we're staring a race-based civil war.
[01:23:57.109 --> 01:24:02.393]  In the face and so on and so forth over the intervening year.
[01:24:02.393 --> 01:24:11.441]  We are here to protect ordinary people to prepare to look after white people in the event of the civil war that we are being promised by black leaders.
[01:24:11.441 --> 01:24:13.322]  It's a national emergency plan.
[01:24:13.322 --> 01:24:15.484]  It extends over the entire country.
[01:24:15.484 --> 01:24:16.665]  It has been in place since 2006.
[01:24:18.326 --> 01:24:19.668]  We are prepared.
[01:24:19.668 --> 01:24:21.309]  And by the way, you know it's going to happen.
[01:24:21.309 --> 01:24:23.211]  This is happening in how many other African countries?
[01:24:23.211 --> 01:24:30.899]  I can think of four in the last 50 years that it starts the exact same way and then all of a sudden everybody's wiped out.
[01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:32.201]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:24:32.201 --> 01:24:33.542]  That's the way it's done.
[01:24:33.542 --> 01:24:36.725]  And the irony of it is that it's not driven by those people.
[01:24:36.725 --> 01:24:40.189]  They are driven by an ideology that's given to them by somebody else.
[01:24:41.013 --> 01:24:42.694]  And that was my next point.
[01:24:42.694 --> 01:24:44.894]  Charlie Manson just died.
[01:24:44.894 --> 01:24:48.236]  He pushed this whole kill the white thing, because the university taught him.
[01:24:48.236 --> 01:24:52.377]  Why are the big banks, why are the mega-rich funding this ideology?
[01:24:52.377 --> 01:24:55.538]  Tell us what the ideology is.
[01:24:55.538 --> 01:25:03.941]  The ideology is a form of communism, but ultimately what it comes down to is an anti-European Christian tradition.
[01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:06.609]  That's fundamentally what it comes down to.
[01:25:06.609 --> 01:25:14.156]  If you see what's being done in the world today, it's being directed at Christian, conservative Europeans.
[01:25:14.156 --> 01:25:29.350]  Ultimately, we are the people, for whatever reason it may be, whether it's in North America or in Europe, who are on the receiving end of this relentless assault against our culture, traditions, religion, history, and our dignity and our pride.
[01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:30.471]  This is a consistent thing.
[01:25:31.994 --> 01:25:38.938]  Well, it's because the new global system's coming in and it wants to erase any system that won't be absorbed and that's strong.
[01:25:38.938 --> 01:25:41.619]  And that's why it's being directed by George Soros.
[01:25:41.619 --> 01:25:44.921]  He admittedly is directing a lot of the South Africa stuff.
[01:25:44.921 --> 01:25:53.926]  Well, Alex, you know, our leader and founder, a guy by the name of Gustav Miller, has been writing about this and talking about this for nearly 20 years.
[01:25:53.926 --> 01:26:00.050]  And for a long time, people thought that he was, you know, off his tree or however you like to put it, that he was crazy.
[01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:04.133]  But over time it's become more and more and more and more and more conspicuous.
[01:26:04.133 --> 01:26:09.076]  And thank God for that because it validates us and we don't look like the crazies anymore.
[01:26:09.076 --> 01:26:16.422]  Thank God for what's happening in the USA and what's happening in Europe because now we're in a position to say to people, hey, don't trust us.
[01:26:16.422 --> 01:26:17.923]  Trust your own eyes.
[01:26:17.923 --> 01:26:23.187]  Look, look, look what's being done and to whom it is being done and who is driving it in the end.
[01:26:23.963 --> 01:26:38.307]  This liberalist, post-modernist, moral relativist, humanist assault on everything that is moral absolutist, on everything that is firm and that is fixed, is now pervasive in the Western world.
[01:26:38.307 --> 01:26:39.547]  It's Jacobin French Revolution.
[01:26:39.547 --> 01:26:41.388]  It's this very same ideology.
[01:26:41.388 --> 01:26:42.368]  It's never been cut.
[01:26:42.368 --> 01:26:44.388]  It's never been totally defeated.
[01:26:44.388 --> 01:26:46.509]  It just keeps moving around like a cancer.
[01:26:47.796 --> 01:26:49.638]  Yeah, it is like a cancer.
[01:26:49.638 --> 01:26:50.379]  It is.
[01:26:50.379 --> 01:26:54.604]  And at the moment it's expressing itself as something terrible in South Africa.
[01:26:54.604 --> 01:26:57.547]  The rate of rape and murder and what have you is just phenomenal.
[01:26:57.547 --> 01:27:05.297]  You know, I saw some of those papers that you had in your hand and it said elderly couple shot whatever and I couldn't help but think to myself, that's
[01:27:05.962 --> 01:27:07.523]  That's not a good example.
[01:27:07.523 --> 01:27:27.880]  You know, with all due respect, the good examples are the elderly couple that had boiling water poured over them, or the elderly gentleman who recently got locked up in his Ford truck and trussed up, and then the truck set on fire and burned to death, or the little girl who was raped, the four-year-old girl who was raped by three men, survived it,
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:38.184]  And because she survived, you know, this was proven in the post-mortem autopsy, she was then bundled up in newspaper with gasoline poured over it and then set on fire.
[01:27:38.184 --> 01:27:53.489]  Or the girl who was crucified on her parents' kitchen table and then raped, a three-year-old girl in this instance, a three-year-old girl raped by four men while crucified to her parents' kitchen table after her father had had his throat slit and her mother had been killed as well.
[01:27:53.969 --> 01:28:00.052]  You know, it is beyond people's imagination what we're in at the moment.
[01:28:00.052 --> 01:28:00.372]  Wow.
[01:28:00.372 --> 01:28:17.880]  Well, I want to talk about how people can shine light on this because, just like Genocide Watch and others, whether it's an Asian group being killed or an African group being killed or people in Latin America, I mean, I'm against any of these genocides, but the UN even admits that in the last decade, Christians are the number one targeted group and the targeting's doubled.
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:25.343]  Just like we saw the UN and the globalists and NATO involved in the Middle East and Syria targeting Christians.
[01:28:25.343 --> 01:28:29.185]  They will go out of their way to kill Christians and it is a program.
[01:28:29.185 --> 01:28:32.086]  Look at China, the Christians are being killed.
[01:28:32.086 --> 01:28:35.408]  But anybody else peaceful, the Buddhists are being killed.
[01:28:35.408 --> 01:28:37.709]  We'll be right back and their organs taken.
[01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:38.389]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:38.389 --> 01:28:39.089]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:39.089 --> 01:28:40.030]  This is the InfoWar.

[01:30:57.074 --> 01:31:00.196]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:31:00.196 --> 01:31:07.622]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullies.
[01:31:07.622 --> 01:31:13.246]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:31:13.986 --> 01:31:21.656]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[01:31:21.656 --> 01:31:29.546]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:31:30.246 --> 01:31:35.308]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[01:31:35.308 --> 01:31:37.449]  They are the anti-liberals.
[01:31:37.449 --> 01:31:50.834]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:32:59.213 --> 01:33:13.656]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:13.656 --> 01:33:19.658]  Big Brother Mainstream Media Government Cover-Ups
[01:33:21.184 --> 01:33:23.065]  You want answers?
[01:33:23.065 --> 01:33:25.005]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:25.005 --> 01:33:33.308]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.308 --> 01:33:36.769]  Shoudlanders.org.
[01:33:36.769 --> 01:33:40.210]  Simon, Rosh is our guest.
[01:33:40.210 --> 01:33:45.652]  I've got so much big breaking news after he leaves us, but what he's talking about is so important, I want to finish up and have him back soon.
[01:33:47.677 --> 01:33:48.618]  But we've got this breaking.
[01:33:48.618 --> 01:33:50.179]  Bezos and Deep State unite.
[01:33:50.179 --> 01:33:55.222]  Amazon launches cloud service for CIA.
[01:33:55.222 --> 01:33:57.603]  Bezos is the CIA, folks.
[01:33:57.603 --> 01:33:58.784]  Look into his dad, all of it.
[01:33:58.784 --> 01:34:00.886]  It never ends.
[01:34:00.886 --> 01:34:03.667]  And then meanwhile, Trump to LaVar Ball.
[01:34:03.667 --> 01:34:05.569]  I should have left them all in jail.
[01:34:05.569 --> 01:34:07.810]  These people are, they're caught shoplifting.
[01:34:07.810 --> 01:34:10.372]  That's like 10 years in jail in China.
[01:34:10.372 --> 01:34:11.172]  Trump gets them out.
[01:34:11.172 --> 01:34:13.374]  China admits that the president interceded.
[01:34:13.374 --> 01:34:16.035]  And the family says, we don't appreciate you because you're Trump.
[01:34:16.035 --> 01:34:16.896]  I mean, it's just...
[01:34:19.352 --> 01:34:24.653]  The entitlement, and the craziness, and just all the weirdness.
[01:34:24.653 --> 01:34:29.095]  It's so sad to see, and then to see countries that the globalist social engineers wreck.
[01:34:29.095 --> 01:34:36.357]  They put communists in, then they extract the resources for almost nothing, and the Africans don't get it, whether they be white or black.
[01:34:36.357 --> 01:34:40.578]  Because when you've been there 300 years, like some of these folks, or longer, you know, you can call yourself an African.
[01:34:41.358 --> 01:34:42.999]  And again, it's not all the tribes doing it.
[01:34:42.999 --> 01:34:44.400]  It's always the ones that get organized.
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:45.600]  And I know there's different factions.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:47.761]  You've got the Zulus.
[01:34:47.761 --> 01:34:49.802]  You've got all the other tribes kind of into the ANC.
[01:34:49.802 --> 01:34:50.342]  I don't live there.
[01:34:50.342 --> 01:34:50.923]  I'm not an expert.
[01:34:50.923 --> 01:34:56.285]  But I know that pretty much all that's left is the farmers that are kind of like what you'd call Amish.
[01:34:56.285 --> 01:35:00.507]  In fact, a lot of them, I guess, come from Amish, from the Dutch and German derivation.
[01:35:00.507 --> 01:35:01.968]  And I've read that, I guess, the
[01:35:02.708 --> 01:35:05.851]  Southlanders organization has some connections.
[01:35:05.851 --> 01:35:11.896]  Describe the background of your group, because again, I mean, I've researched it, but there's a lot of different subgroups.
[01:35:11.896 --> 01:35:13.637]  Who are some of the different groups there in Africa?
[01:35:13.637 --> 01:35:15.438]  Who are you trying to organize together?
[01:35:15.438 --> 01:35:17.880]  Because, I mean, you're the breadbasket of much of Africa.
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.102]  Everybody knows that, who studied it.
[01:35:20.102 --> 01:35:26.467]  And then it's shown, once you get overthrown and just kicked off your land that you've developed, that people see and want,
[01:35:27.548 --> 01:35:30.352]  It always goes out of cultivation and falls apart.
[01:35:30.352 --> 01:35:34.156]  So, again, why are the communists pushing so hard to get you out?
[01:35:34.156 --> 01:35:39.141]  I guess because the internationalists want to bring down stability so they can exploit the population better.
[01:35:39.141 --> 01:35:40.183]  They don't want civilization.
[01:35:41.530 --> 01:35:48.311]  Well, it's that, and they're also absolutely devoted to this idea of destroying this European Christian tradition.
[01:35:48.311 --> 01:35:53.773]  Whether people like it or not, they only need to look at the evidence, not in South Africa, but around the world, of what is happening today.
[01:35:53.773 --> 01:36:02.034]  Whose culture is being undermined by abortion, pornography, and gay marriage, and what have you, in complete contradiction to the doctrines, the prevailing doctrines.
[01:36:02.034 --> 01:36:04.895]  I mean, it makes no sense no matter how you look at it.
[01:36:04.895 --> 01:36:07.616]  You can't defend this thing forever and ever and ever.
[01:36:07.616 --> 01:36:09.316]  At some point, you've got to
[01:36:10.293 --> 01:36:13.115]  Believe the very evidence that lies before you.
[01:36:13.115 --> 01:36:14.936]  Well sure, the globalists admit this plan.
[01:36:14.936 --> 01:36:27.444]  So what I'm asking you is, I mean basically the organization you're with, the groups you represent, aren't you guys, I mean basically like Amish, living in a basic Christian tradition, farming, raising your families?
[01:36:28.772 --> 01:36:32.115]  Yes, it is a very, very conservative culture.
[01:36:32.115 --> 01:36:57.974]  Of course, people have televisions and modern devices and appliances and that kind of stuff, but the fundamental cultural values of the people who I represent or who the State of London is devoted to protecting, that is to say, particularly the Afrikaner, Boer people of South Africa, also other whites, because that's how the international laws under which we are constituted legally work,
[01:36:58.574 --> 01:37:02.437]  But those Afrikaner Boer people are very, very conservative.
[01:37:02.437 --> 01:37:05.218]  I'll illustrate the point to you very briefly, Alex.
[01:37:05.218 --> 01:37:22.089]  You know, we hold to a series of prophecies that said this crisis, the prophecies given a hundred years ago, will occur at a time when a man with a place-cale faith, that is to say hair resembling a wig, will be in power in the United States.
[01:37:22.089 --> 01:37:26.612]  And he will take over the reins of power from a black man.
[01:37:27.405 --> 01:37:29.546]  And there are various other things.
[01:37:29.546 --> 01:37:31.006]  I won't go on and on and on about it.
[01:37:31.006 --> 01:37:39.329]  But the point is that we are devoted to an ancient culture and ancient... Well, that's intriguing though, because I want to hear about this prophecy.
[01:37:39.329 --> 01:37:43.430]  Well, this chap lived... He was born in 1864, died in 1926.
[01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:46.111]  Very pious chap.
[01:37:46.111 --> 01:37:52.993]  And he made a long series of prophecies in which he described that there would be three world wars.
[01:37:52.993 --> 01:37:54.754]  And he said that the third world war
[01:37:55.450 --> 01:38:05.897]  ...would happen in parallel to a civil war in South Africa, a race-based civil war between the races, but ultimately driven by the globalists, which we have always said.
[01:38:05.897 --> 01:38:09.079]  Anybody who can read Afrikaans language is welcome to go on our website.
[01:38:09.079 --> 01:38:19.927]  There are hundreds of articles that make it very, very clear that we see our first enemy not as black people, or it's not the black people, it is this global capitalist new world order.
[01:38:19.927 --> 01:38:21.088]  He said that
[01:38:22.351 --> 01:38:49.002]  The Third World War would happen in tandem with a crisis in South Africa, and he said it would be at a time when this man, who is a stern man, who gazes sternly, has hair resembling a wig, and he takes over the reins of the USA from a black man, after the black man has confused the identity and the orientation of the United States.
[01:38:49.002 --> 01:38:50.303]  He said that would be
[01:38:51.952 --> 01:38:58.241]  At a time when there's a wave of black and brown-skinned migrants into Europe.
[01:38:58.241 --> 01:39:00.465]  He was very, very explicit about it.
[01:39:00.465 --> 01:39:05.593]  He said following that, there would be a global financial crisis.
[01:39:06.261 --> 01:39:18.644]  And he spoke particularly of the fact that the money in Europe would not be worth the paper, that the value of the paper would be greater than the amount of money that it denominated.
[01:39:18.644 --> 01:39:26.166]  And by the way, I've read about this fellow before and forgot about it, and he actually, it's on record, he said all this, that he was listening to back then, and it was all basically coming true.
[01:39:26.166 --> 01:39:28.127]  The Euro is starting to collapse right now.
[01:39:29.639 --> 01:39:39.144]  Yeah, well he lost practically all of his credibility when he made one of his final prophecies, namely that there would be a black government in South Africa.
[01:39:39.144 --> 01:39:43.447]  Now a hundred years ago everybody thought that he was just plain crazy and they wrote him off.
[01:39:43.447 --> 01:39:53.673]  He said the first black ruler on the throne of South Africa would be deemed a saint by the world and when he died he would lie in state in a glass coffin
[01:39:54.253 --> 01:40:03.340]  And at his burial, dignitaries, and he spoke about princes and rulers and so on, would come from all over the world to pay respects at his grave site.
[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:05.542]  Now, the meaning of that is very, very clear.
[01:40:05.542 --> 01:40:13.508]  Paul, the reason I listen to stuff like this, there's a lot of false prophecies the Bible say, who go out and put out this info, but people like this, where it's been proven right over and over again, it's incredible.
[01:40:13.508 --> 01:40:22.535]  And I personally haven't had like full-on deals like this, but I've had experiences, dreams, and things that came true exactly later, so that's why I know how real this stuff is.
[01:40:23.672 --> 01:40:28.356]  Yeah, it can be, and I think everybody approaches this stuff with some skepticism.
[01:40:28.356 --> 01:40:32.780]  My father gave me the book to read at first, and I gave it back to him very dismissively.
[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:44.991]  I thought it was absolute nonsense, until I began to see that what he prophesied or predicted was coming true word for word for word, very often in the same words that he used.
[01:40:44.991 --> 01:40:49.655]  And he did say that a bucket of blood would fall over in Zimbabwe
[01:40:50.345 --> 01:41:00.251]  And once that bucket of blood fell over, in other words, it would be a lot of blood spilt or blood shed, he said it would come into South Africa.
[01:41:00.251 --> 01:41:05.795]  So now we don't know whether there's going to be bloodshed in Zimbabwe today, next week, next month, next year, who knows?
[01:41:05.795 --> 01:41:10.137]  But these are the things that we're paying attention to because so far he's been right.
[01:41:10.137 --> 01:41:13.459]  And we're on the receiving end of a lot of pain at the moment.
[01:41:13.459 --> 01:41:19.203]  Everybody knows somebody who's been murdered or raped or whose child has been raped.
[01:41:19.853 --> 01:41:22.195]  Or who's been despiccad.
[01:41:22.195 --> 01:41:26.659]  I was on a farm recently, which has eight neighboring farms.
[01:41:26.659 --> 01:41:32.924]  And on each of the eight neighboring farms, somebody had been killed in recent years.
[01:41:32.924 --> 01:41:35.587]  Now that's, you know, it's severe.
[01:41:36.815 --> 01:41:38.976]  And it's getting worse, and it's what the communists do.
[01:41:38.976 --> 01:41:40.696]  It's helter-skelter.
[01:41:40.696 --> 01:41:42.317]  Simon, I'm really impressed with the work you're doing.
[01:41:42.317 --> 01:41:47.159]  Please come on, please have the leader of your organization on, and give us updates here.
[01:41:47.159 --> 01:41:51.341]  So please stay in contact, suidlanders.org.
[01:41:51.341 --> 01:41:58.063]  And people can, I guess, donate there to help get your civil emergency plan implemented and prepared.
[01:41:58.063 --> 01:41:58.823]  Please.
[01:41:58.823 --> 01:42:00.384]  We would appreciate it very much.
[01:42:00.384 --> 01:42:01.504]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:42:01.504 --> 01:42:02.065]  You bet.
[01:42:02.065 --> 01:42:02.525]  Absolutely.
[01:42:02.525 --> 01:42:03.005]  God bless you.
[01:42:04.414 --> 01:42:10.697]  That's what we're here for, ladies and gentlemen, is making preparations because we know the enemy plans.
[01:42:10.697 --> 01:42:15.739]  We have a leg up if we take action, if we're ready.
[01:42:15.739 --> 01:42:19.901]  And again, they're trying to beat everybody into race-based garbage in the U.S.
[01:42:19.901 --> 01:42:20.841]  to make us fight with each other.
[01:42:20.841 --> 01:42:21.201]  We can't do it.
[01:42:21.201 --> 01:42:27.624]  We have to come together, love each other, see through it, and know it's class warfare that these globalists are carrying out.
[01:42:28.905 --> 01:42:30.747]  But no, they hate you because you're Christian.
[01:42:30.747 --> 01:42:38.634]  They're announcing world government, they're announcing microchips, they're announcing this new god that Google's been developing that's going to be AI that you worship, like right out of Revelation.
[01:42:38.634 --> 01:42:41.577]  I mean, look, it's happening.
[01:42:41.577 --> 01:42:45.841]  And most of the churches are cowards and are going along with it because they're not really churches, they just want the money.
[01:42:45.841 --> 01:42:48.103]  All right, Trump just escalated things with North Korea.
[01:42:48.103 --> 01:42:49.864]  We'll tell you about that on the other side.
[01:42:49.864 --> 01:42:50.505]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:42:55.811 --> 01:43:03.273]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.

[01:46:58.733 --> 01:47:01.335]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:32.865]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:38.180 --> 01:47:42.663]  Well, Trump has declared North Korea an aider of terrorist states.
[01:47:42.663 --> 01:47:44.904]  That means they can stop their ships.
[01:47:44.904 --> 01:47:47.085]  That means they can put more sanctions on them.
[01:47:47.085 --> 01:47:51.288]  That means that it's just one more ratchet up towards war.
[01:47:51.288 --> 01:47:56.431]  We have that story up on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[01:47:56.431 --> 01:47:57.812]  Then I've got all this other news.
[01:47:57.812 --> 01:47:59.273]  Visas and Deep State Unite.
[01:47:59.273 --> 01:48:02.114]  Amazon launches cloud service for CIA.
[01:48:02.114 --> 01:48:05.717]  We first talked about this about a year ago when it was just in trade publications, but
[01:48:06.437 --> 01:48:08.459]  This has far-reaching implications.
[01:48:08.459 --> 01:48:10.560]  I'll explain why here in just a second.
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:16.805]  Also, Saudi Arabia vows to take on Iran amid warnings the region is in dangerous abyss.
[01:48:16.805 --> 01:48:17.906]  That's out of the express.
[01:48:17.906 --> 01:48:23.170]  We told you months ago war there is looming and may be imminent.
[01:48:23.170 --> 01:48:24.651]  But the first big thing I want to get to
[01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:27.511]  Charles Manson is so interesting.
[01:48:27.511 --> 01:48:32.553]  It's hard to not... Because usually when I talk about Charles Manson, people don't really make a big deal out of it because he's not in the news.
[01:48:32.553 --> 01:48:39.017]  But now, whatever we talk about with Manson, we'll end up getting millions of views on Facebook and Twitter and places, and we'll reach new people.
[01:48:39.017 --> 01:48:40.297]  They need to know about MKUltra.
[01:48:40.297 --> 01:48:47.021]  They need to know about the program he was part of to destabilize and try to trigger a race war for cultural upheaval.
[01:48:48.695 --> 01:48:52.476]  Because the globalists don't want us to be Christian and to come together and not be racist.
[01:48:52.476 --> 01:48:57.257]  They want to claim they're fighting racism while stirring everyone up to be racist.
[01:48:57.257 --> 01:49:00.858]  That's really the secret plan, which isn't a secret anymore.
[01:49:00.858 --> 01:49:03.899]  So we're going to talk about all that coming up.
[01:49:03.899 --> 01:49:06.099]  But first, expert.
[01:49:06.099 --> 01:49:09.860]  Great crash of 2018 will start in the bond market.
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:13.221]  I saw this yesterday, did some more research.
[01:49:13.221 --> 01:49:15.081]  It is a top expert saying that.
[01:49:15.081 --> 01:49:17.982]  Many others are saying it too because it is so overvalued.
[01:49:19.577 --> 01:49:23.659]  Then I saw this this morning and I said, whoa, I better cover this.
[01:49:23.659 --> 01:49:29.502]  Euro crash with Angela Merkel's fourth term and Chancellor is in doubt as U.S.
[01:49:29.502 --> 01:49:32.043]  growth forecasts are on the rise.
[01:49:32.043 --> 01:49:35.044]  I'm going to break this down here in a moment because it's key.
[01:49:35.044 --> 01:49:41.908]  First off, though, ladies and gentlemen, we are running specials.
[01:49:42.850 --> 01:49:46.271]  This week that are amongst the best we ever run.
[01:49:46.271 --> 01:49:52.593]  And I've been running more and more specials as things go on because I've noticed the bigger the specials I run, the more people buy product.
[01:49:52.593 --> 01:49:56.934]  But there's kind of a point at which we discount things so much that it isn't really funding our operation.
[01:49:56.934 --> 01:50:07.817]  And I've lately, the accountants have shown me, I've kind of reached that point where, hey, you're selling the probiotic at $5 over what it costs, and then you're doing free shipping.
[01:50:07.817 --> 01:50:10.298]  Alex, we're losing a dollar on average, stop.
[01:50:12.048 --> 01:50:15.331]  And so, it really does come down to that.
[01:50:15.331 --> 01:50:18.314]  Brain Force Plus is now back in stock.
[01:50:18.314 --> 01:50:19.495]  We got a small shipment in.
[01:50:19.495 --> 01:50:22.417]  We should get a lot more towards the end of December, but it's about to be sold out again.
[01:50:22.417 --> 01:50:25.300]  50% off and free shipping.
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:29.644]  That's the first big special of Black Friday week.
[01:50:29.644 --> 01:50:31.285]  We're just gonna have it right through this weekend.
[01:50:31.285 --> 01:50:33.227]  50% off, 5,700 reviews by Power Reviews, 4.5% off.
[01:50:39.395 --> 01:50:41.196]  Six stars.
[01:50:41.196 --> 01:50:57.524]  And we just went out and researched the highest quality, brain-empowering, focus-empowering, energy-empowering, in a healthy way, or organic substances that are known to be safe, and we put it in there and we sell it for $39, when similar compounds are $70 to $80.
[01:50:57.524 --> 01:51:01.465]  But when we sell it for 50% off, ladies and gentlemen, 50% off, it is $19.96.
[01:51:01.465 --> 01:51:01.666]  I mean,
[01:51:07.495 --> 01:51:13.445]  That is a great, great deal on a really, really powerful brain pill.
[01:51:13.445 --> 01:51:21.779]  Brain Force Plus, now with 20% more capsules in each bottle, which was a big deal for us to do because it cost a lot, some of the compounds.
[01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:24.451]  People love it though.
[01:51:24.451 --> 01:51:26.652]  It is the overall total bestseller.
[01:51:26.652 --> 01:51:29.674]  But we sold it at such a low price, it doesn't really fund the operation.
[01:51:29.674 --> 01:51:31.095]  X2 is one of our other top sellers.
[01:51:31.095 --> 01:51:32.396]  Supermail is a great seller.
[01:51:32.396 --> 01:51:43.043]  The problem is it's made in a proprietary system, cold pressed, so it's hard to always get it California standards, which is impossible to pass basically, and then have enough of it cold pressed, so it's sold out half the time.
[01:51:43.043 --> 01:51:44.384]  We've got that back in.
[01:51:44.384 --> 01:51:45.865]  But we've got a bunch of specials.
[01:51:45.865 --> 01:51:50.408]  We're going to be running new specials every single day.
[01:51:51.496 --> 01:51:55.599]  We've got Pro-Pure 25% off on that water filtration and free shipping.
[01:51:55.599 --> 01:51:57.641]  Brain Force Plus 25% off.
[01:51:57.641 --> 01:52:00.724]  So that is the specials that we've got for you today.
[01:52:00.724 --> 01:52:09.191]  We have the new products Floralife and we also have the Carnivore Digestive Enzyme that helps you absorb the nutrients and amino acids out of the meat and out of the
[01:52:10.745 --> 01:52:14.167]  Protein and out of the fat and out of the carbohydrates really is important.
[01:52:14.167 --> 01:52:17.208]  Floral Life Advanced Restoration, 50 million live.
[01:52:17.208 --> 01:52:21.511]  And then we have the 15 billion everyday maintenance that's excellent as well.
[01:52:21.511 --> 01:52:22.871]  And Carnivore, now in stock.
[01:52:22.871 --> 01:52:24.132]  Try them out for yourself.
[01:52:24.132 --> 01:52:25.373]  We just commit to get these products.
[01:52:25.373 --> 01:52:27.514]  You help fund the operation and you help yourself.
[01:52:27.514 --> 01:52:30.796]  But when I remember to take all this stuff, it makes my life so much better.
[01:52:30.796 --> 01:52:31.436]  Then I forget.
[01:52:31.436 --> 01:52:37.359]  Then I wonder why I'm sluggish or why I'm, you know, not as, you know, stuff in my gut isn't perfect.
[01:52:37.359 --> 01:52:38.160]  And it's like, oh, wait.
[01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:49.408]  We have these things God gave us through nature that we've gone out and sourced and got the very best stuff that works really well and it's here and it's very very popular but that's how, again, we fund this operation.
[01:52:49.408 --> 01:52:56.053]  So I want to thank you all for your support and everything you've been doing because without you we would not be here.
[01:52:56.053 --> 01:52:58.115]  And we're all facing the same globalist onslaught.
[01:52:58.115 --> 01:53:01.357]  We're all dealing with the same globalist operations.
[01:53:01.357 --> 01:53:04.800]  We're all facing down the barrel of that and without coming together
[01:53:06.874 --> 01:53:13.684]  And without supporting each other, and without really focusing on the fact that we're under attack, we have no future.
[01:53:13.684 --> 01:53:15.266]  Humanity all has red blood.
[01:53:16.209 --> 01:53:23.015]  We all have one destiny if we choose it, to live together in peace and experience amazing secrets of the universe.
[01:53:23.015 --> 01:53:25.557]  And Trump's great crime is he's bringing people together.
[01:53:25.557 --> 01:53:27.079]  The globalists want to break the country.
[01:53:27.079 --> 01:53:30.241]  He first said we have a country, we have a nation and it's great.
[01:53:30.241 --> 01:53:32.143]  And here's what made it great and let's come together.
[01:53:32.143 --> 01:53:37.267]  And they can't stand that because they want us alone and divided and pathetic and scared.
[01:53:37.267 --> 01:53:40.951]  And it's not just us reverse engineering their operations against us.
[01:53:43.015 --> 01:53:44.116]  We don't just have the WikiLeaks.
[01:53:44.116 --> 01:53:51.764]  We don't just have all these internal documents and statements and Gruber on TV saying, thank God you're so stupid.
[01:53:51.764 --> 01:53:56.808]  We have Sean Parker, former head of Facebook.
[01:53:56.808 --> 01:54:01.333]  We have the Facebook documents that got leaked by high level executives.
[01:54:01.333 --> 01:54:06.318]  They say there's no more than 10 executives and maybe 20 or 30 assistants.
[01:54:07.725 --> 01:54:13.427]  That had access to the Facebook plan that got released earlier this year and got almost no attention.
[01:54:13.427 --> 01:54:16.869]  It was in the Australian newspapers because it got leaked in Australia.
[01:54:16.869 --> 01:54:28.393]  And it said we keep them desperate, we keep our people poor, we want to keep them alone, we want to make them depressed, and we want to make them liberal so that they don't have a family.
[01:54:28.393 --> 01:54:29.914]  I mean, that is so diabolical!
[01:54:33.046 --> 01:54:39.968]  They exploit your vulnerability, they try to make you more vulnerable, and then they get up on TV and they admit it!
[01:54:39.968 --> 01:54:40.928]  Why did Parker do that?
[01:54:40.928 --> 01:54:41.608]  Is he a good guy?
[01:54:41.608 --> 01:54:51.570]  I don't know.
[01:54:51.570 --> 01:54:54.411]  It's just crazy.
[01:54:54.411 --> 01:54:56.251]  But we're on an express elevator to hell.
[01:54:56.251 --> 01:54:58.772]  And I don't say it to be negative.
[01:54:58.772 --> 01:55:00.252]  I'm an incredibly positive person.
[01:55:01.434 --> 01:55:12.517]  Positive in that we can change things and fix things, but I use the analogy of if you're drinking a bottle of vodka a day and your liver's starting to go out, the doctor says, hey, you don't stop, your liver's going to fail.
[01:55:12.517 --> 01:55:15.598]  And you know, we're not going to give alcoholics a new liver.
[01:55:15.598 --> 01:55:16.239]  You're going to die.
[01:55:16.239 --> 01:55:17.439]  You understand?
[01:55:20.066 --> 01:55:22.747]  And people look at the doctor and they say, you're just being a killjoy.
[01:55:22.747 --> 01:55:23.847]  You're just a punk.
[01:55:23.847 --> 01:55:25.068]  You're a fear monger.
[01:55:25.068 --> 01:55:27.308]  And a year later, they're in the ground.
[01:55:27.308 --> 01:55:30.309]  I had several friends.
[01:55:30.309 --> 01:55:32.590]  Hell, I've had more than that.
[01:55:32.590 --> 01:55:36.191]  Now that I'm this old, I just lost more family than.
[01:55:36.191 --> 01:55:39.912]  Labor failure, cousin, pretty young.
[01:55:39.912 --> 01:55:45.394]  Same age as me.
[01:55:45.394 --> 01:55:45.994]  And it's, you know,
[01:55:47.841 --> 01:55:50.004]  It's a serious issue and it's a good allegory.
[01:55:50.004 --> 01:55:51.506]  It's a good parallel.
[01:55:51.506 --> 01:56:03.722]  It's a good example of the New World Order is run by really selfish, cold-blooded people and they think you deserve to be annihilated and destroyed and overtaken because you're not wise to this.
[01:56:03.722 --> 01:56:05.384]  I mean, I'm telling you...
[01:56:06.721 --> 01:56:17.703]  Decades before they want you to know what their plans are, because they're so arrogant, they write white papers and they have events and, you know, 20-something years ago I'd have to dig around to find this and found it shocking.
[01:56:17.703 --> 01:56:22.344]  Look, Ted Turner says kill 90% of the public and dumb everybody down and cut off the resources.
[01:56:22.344 --> 01:56:29.706]  And he'd say it, you know, in an Audubon Society quarterly, or he'd say it in a Club of Rome deal that only went out to members, and I'd have to go to the UT
[01:56:30.905 --> 01:56:34.147]  You know, law department and ask permission to get in.
[01:56:34.147 --> 01:56:35.948]  Because I'd read about it in a book and want to know if it was true.
[01:56:35.948 --> 01:56:42.651]  And I'd go down and like, here was the proof, like in a movie, I'd get chills up my back, how they're planning to kill everybody and how they're going to dumb us down.
[01:56:42.651 --> 01:56:45.092]  And I'd look around, I'd see the plan being implemented.
[01:56:45.092 --> 01:56:47.653]  Now, this is real.
[01:56:47.653 --> 01:56:52.416]  And then I started warning people and they said, this guy's crazy.
[01:56:52.416 --> 01:56:57.238]  I mean, you know, 19, 20 years ago, I'd read about human animal chimeras.
[01:56:57.238 --> 01:57:00.220]  I didn't want to believe it, but it was in major elite publications.
[01:57:01.414 --> 01:57:05.517]  By elite it just means to them, where they communicate with each other.
[01:57:05.517 --> 01:57:16.526]  They just talk about all this stuff like they talk about you like you have less value than a grain of salt.
[01:57:16.526 --> 01:57:17.667]  And they just talk all about it.
[01:57:19.478 --> 01:57:24.143]  Once they get the computer grid in place to control everybody, then they're going to kill everybody.
[01:57:24.143 --> 01:57:27.266]  But right now there'd be a war, you'd resist, you'd fight back.
[01:57:27.266 --> 01:57:29.148]  They'd never win a war right now, the globalists.
[01:57:29.148 --> 01:57:30.549]  It would end up blowing back on them.
[01:57:30.549 --> 01:57:41.700]  They've got to get you so drugged out, so whacked out, so confused, with robots, sentries, and computer grids everywhere, so that when they flip the switch they've got autonomous robot armies to let them carry out the main wipeout.
[01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:43.482]  So again, it's coming, and just remember,
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:50.244]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[01:59:49.190 --> 01:59:51.793]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:10.936 --> 02:00:15.918]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:15.918 --> 02:00:22.121]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.121 --> 02:00:26.162]  Well, as usual, Stefan Molyneux is in fuego.
[02:00:26.162 --> 02:00:27.203]  On fire!
[02:00:28.757 --> 02:00:31.238]  We like folks that are on fire.
[02:00:31.238 --> 02:00:32.638]  He's going to be joining us coming up.
[02:00:32.638 --> 02:00:34.619]  We're going to go through a lot of this news.
[02:00:34.619 --> 02:00:38.260]  The great part about Stefan, he's always a newshound, so he's up on everything.
[02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:42.601]  I want to get into all this with him, including the word tranny being banned.
[02:00:42.601 --> 02:00:51.804]  They're sending police now to college radio stations to illegally arrest people, to pull stunts, to act like the word tranny is illegal.
[02:00:51.804 --> 02:00:54.525]  Facebook decided, I'm not kidding, go to Wikipedia,
[02:00:55.445 --> 02:01:05.050]  This year, Zuckerberg decided that it is a word you can't use, but if someone's using it to describe how someone else misused it, then it's okay.
[02:01:05.050 --> 02:01:20.798]  And they've told us, in phone calls, high-level folks at Facebook, we told them we were recording it, and they go, that's fine, please just paraphrase us, not word-for-word, and we go, we're recording it, like they were like robots, they didn't, they just have canned responses.
[02:01:20.798 --> 02:01:22.900]  I've got like 20 minutes of it recorded in there, I mean...
[02:01:24.219 --> 02:01:29.500]  And I said, listen, if I was against somebody, I should have the free speech, unless I'm calling for violence.
[02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:38.883]  But I'm not hating on somebody because they want to dress up like a woman or take hormones and be one, just like a guy might want to take more steroids and become more male.
[02:01:38.883 --> 02:01:39.783]  I'm a libertarian, man.
[02:01:39.783 --> 02:01:41.344]  You want to drink vodka until you die?
[02:01:41.344 --> 02:01:41.644]  Do it.
[02:01:41.644 --> 02:01:44.864]  You want to do things that are healthy, do things that are bad?
[02:01:44.864 --> 02:01:46.305]  I don't want to pay for your sex change.
[02:01:46.305 --> 02:01:48.986]  I don't want to pay for your plastic surgery.
[02:01:48.986 --> 02:01:50.146]  I mean, it's plastic surgery.
[02:01:51.207 --> 02:01:55.649]  I don't want, I don't want to pay for you.
[02:01:55.649 --> 02:01:59.430]  And it's like making this new super class.
[02:01:59.430 --> 02:02:00.191]  So yeah, let's play it.
[02:02:00.191 --> 02:02:00.531]  Here it is.
[02:02:00.531 --> 02:02:06.933]  College calls police on student who said tranny on the radio.
[02:02:06.933 --> 02:02:10.535]  Use the term on their program, deplorable radio.
[02:02:10.535 --> 02:02:12.996]  Calls the police.
[02:02:12.996 --> 02:02:15.437]  Just like the liberal, this is up in Minnesota, just like the liberal schools let
[02:02:18.962 --> 02:02:22.605]  Antifa beat you up and then nothing happens.
[02:02:22.605 --> 02:02:25.967]  And it's, look, they're choosing words they can ban.
[02:02:25.967 --> 02:02:27.768]  Now they want to ban the word mother and father.
[02:02:27.768 --> 02:02:29.950]  I'm not going to stop using it.
[02:02:29.950 --> 02:02:34.673]  And if I wanted to use it and say he was a bad father, he was a bad mother, in a pejorative, I can.
[02:02:34.673 --> 02:02:38.256]  But I don't need to sit here and say, oh, I'm not against you, please don't censor me.
[02:02:38.256 --> 02:02:39.957]  I'm not against anybody.
[02:02:39.957 --> 02:02:41.458]  And I never have been.
[02:02:41.458 --> 02:02:47.362]  But it doesn't mean if a bunch of trannies have an event and then dance naked in front of kids here in Austin,
[02:02:48.283 --> 02:02:50.766]  Literally, with nothing but glitter on their genitals.
[02:02:50.766 --> 02:02:53.549]  I don't care if it's heterosexual or whatever you're doing.
[02:02:53.549 --> 02:02:55.732]  Homosexual, it's illegal.
[02:02:55.732 --> 02:02:58.455]  It's wrong, and you're really pushing it.
[02:02:58.455 --> 02:03:00.537]  And you're hiding behind your rights.
[02:03:00.537 --> 02:03:04.782]  And a lot of pedophiles have picked up your banner and are hiding behind it, so you need to understand that.
[02:03:04.782 --> 02:03:08.326]  And again, a lot of big liberal activists have pointed that out and said it's child abuse.
[02:03:09.673 --> 02:03:10.853]  So let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[02:03:10.853 --> 02:03:18.076]  This is what you get the police coming after you for, to pretend like it's a dirty word that's an FCC violation.
[02:03:18.076 --> 02:03:19.337]  Well, that's the FCC.
[02:03:19.337 --> 02:03:20.457]  It's not an FCC violation.
[02:03:20.457 --> 02:03:21.517]  It's not the cops.
[02:03:21.517 --> 02:03:24.919]  So here's Colorado law, just like, oh, take the vaccines or we'll arrest you.
[02:03:24.919 --> 02:03:25.239]  Here it is.
[02:03:25.879 --> 02:03:29.680]  We have a group here called the Queer Devil Worshippers for a better future.
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:33.941]  It's kind of like our version of Antifa here at Morris.
[02:03:33.941 --> 02:03:35.982]  Um, except that... By the way, hit pause.
[02:03:35.982 --> 02:03:37.762]  I'm going to come back and play the whole thing.
[02:03:37.762 --> 02:03:40.383]  We have a group here called Queer Devil Worshippers.
[02:03:40.383 --> 02:03:41.864]  And a lot of those groups want to be radical.
[02:03:41.864 --> 02:03:42.904]  That's what they say.
[02:03:42.904 --> 02:03:45.985]  By the way, they call themselves the Queer Group or the Queer Event.
[02:03:46.345 --> 02:03:51.228]  And then you go, oh look, they're having the queer event, and they go, oh my gosh, you're a band, you said queer.
[02:03:51.228 --> 02:03:55.770]  See, they're playing these semantical games, and it's not right.
[02:03:55.770 --> 02:03:56.490]  It's dangerous.
[02:03:56.490 --> 02:03:57.431]  It's authoritarian.
[02:03:57.431 --> 02:03:59.012]  So, so, back it up and play it again.
[02:04:01.383 --> 02:04:05.285]  We have a group here called the Queer Devil Worshippers for a Better Future.
[02:04:05.285 --> 02:04:08.868]  It's kind of like our version of Antifa here at Morris.
[02:04:08.868 --> 02:04:11.329]  Except they're nicer.
[02:04:11.329 --> 02:04:12.130]  They're not nicer.
[02:04:12.130 --> 02:04:13.530]  They're just more civilized.
[02:04:13.530 --> 02:04:14.131]  They're nicer.
[02:04:14.131 --> 02:04:15.111]  They're much more tender.
[02:04:15.111 --> 02:04:18.193]  They're nicer and less violent.
[02:04:18.193 --> 02:04:21.956]  Well, the only reason they're not violent is because there's not enough of them.
[02:04:21.956 --> 02:04:24.137]  And everybody knows everybody here at Morris.
[02:04:25.629 --> 02:04:29.132]  Like, you know, you can definitely, you see one tranny... Alright, so we're going to come back.
[02:04:29.132 --> 02:04:33.294]  We're going to come back.
[02:04:33.294 --> 02:04:36.657]  And they use the word tranny, created by the trannies.
[02:04:36.657 --> 02:04:41.080]  And now they say, you can't, kind of like homosexual, they said is mean to gay people.
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:42.041]  They said use the word gay.
[02:04:42.041 --> 02:04:43.121]  We go, okay, we'll be nice.
[02:04:43.121 --> 02:04:43.982]  We'll use your word.
[02:04:43.982 --> 02:04:46.183]  Now they go, don't use mother and father either.
[02:04:46.183 --> 02:04:47.684]  They're trying to be word police, man.
[02:04:47.684 --> 02:04:49.386]  This is serious authoritarianism.
[02:04:49.386 --> 02:04:50.907]  It's not about what's happening in your bedroom.
[02:04:50.907 --> 02:04:53.769]  It's about what you're trying to force on us, and we're not putting up with it.
[02:04:54.577 --> 02:05:06.023]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[02:05:06.023 --> 02:05:14.888]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore, for being able to break down meat and other proteins better, and then the other two is a
[02:05:15.168 --> 02:05:23.910]  Powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in flora life, advanced restoration.
[02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:28.931]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable flora life everyday maintenance.
[02:05:28.931 --> 02:05:39.193]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable price.
[02:05:39.193 --> 02:05:44.594]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[02:05:45.054 --> 02:05:58.332]  When you purchase it at Infowarsstore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[02:05:58.332 --> 02:06:00.295]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:00.295 --> 02:06:01.997]  Crashing with lies and disinformation.
[02:06:03.095 --> 02:06:04.556]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:06:04.556 --> 02:06:06.497]  We have a giant spectrum of news.
[02:06:06.497 --> 02:06:09.198]  The European Union's euro is crashing.
[02:06:09.198 --> 02:06:15.461]  People are having police called on them for using the word tranny, claiming it's an illegal word, not just a hateful word.
[02:06:15.461 --> 02:06:19.203]  All because Facebook just this year said it was now hateful.
[02:06:19.203 --> 02:06:21.804]  No one ever really said that before, but they decided.
[02:06:21.804 --> 02:06:23.825]  They first have a debate about a word, then they're...
[02:06:24.588 --> 02:06:27.872]  They're group decides it's illegal and next week it'll be more words.
[02:06:27.872 --> 02:06:29.473]  They tell you what words you can use.
[02:06:29.473 --> 02:06:30.514]  They're God.
[02:06:30.514 --> 02:06:31.596]  So that's coming up.
[02:06:31.596 --> 02:06:35.220]  Charles Manson dead at 83 and so much more in this third hour.
[02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:39.544]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, here's Stefan Molyneux talking about how
[02:06:40.385 --> 02:06:46.429]  This is a great 20-minute video he did explaining that conservatives shouldn't play the reindeer games.
[02:06:46.429 --> 02:06:55.614]  They shouldn't play the leftist games when it comes to running around taking any accuser and elevating it as if it's judge, jury, and executioner.
[02:06:55.614 --> 02:06:58.936]  So here is Mr. Infuego himself.
[02:06:58.936 --> 02:07:02.018]  Republicans, I just got one question for you.
[02:07:04.577 --> 02:07:06.497]  Are you trying to lose?
[02:07:06.497 --> 02:07:12.899]  Are you trying to give away the stored blood and treasure of Western civilization as a whole?
[02:07:12.899 --> 02:07:15.719]  Is it a calling to lose?
[02:07:15.719 --> 02:07:16.740]  Is it a job?
[02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:17.480]  Is it a career?
[02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:18.460]  Is it a hobby?
[02:07:18.460 --> 02:07:22.041]  Whatever it is, you've pretty much got it down to perfection.
[02:07:22.041 --> 02:07:24.441]  You've got a senate seat on the line.
[02:07:24.441 --> 02:07:27.682]  Senate seat on the line!
[02:07:27.682 --> 02:07:27.822]  And...
[02:07:30.478 --> 02:07:41.782]  Moore has been accused of touching girls inappropriately 40 years ago, right before an election.
[02:07:41.782 --> 02:07:43.042]  Huh.
[02:07:43.042 --> 02:07:54.206]  And you see, the mainstream media cares so much about all of this inappropriate touching that they, in 44 minutes, they call up all of the Republican senators and they get all, oh, what are your comments?
[02:07:54.206 --> 02:07:54.866]  What do you think?
[02:07:54.866 --> 02:07:55.986]  I need your comment on this.
[02:07:55.986 --> 02:07:56.847]  Tell me what you think.
[02:07:56.847 --> 02:07:57.627]  What are your comments?
[02:07:59.349 --> 02:08:08.312]  Because you see the mainstream media, they're appalled, they're outraged, they're horrified at any kind of inappropriate touching.
[02:08:08.312 --> 02:08:11.893]  Teenage girls.
[02:08:11.893 --> 02:08:16.775]  So this is what they do, and this is why you lose, but you don't have to.
[02:08:16.775 --> 02:08:21.577]  Stop taking this moral high ground of self-congratulatory moral preening!
[02:08:23.943 --> 02:08:33.988]  As you ride the four horses of appeasement, compromise, and moral self-congratulation into the abyss.
[02:08:33.988 --> 02:08:35.589]  You took people's votes.
[02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:38.671]  You take the money from the taxpayers to do your job.
[02:08:38.671 --> 02:08:43.273]  Now start doing your job.
[02:08:43.273 --> 02:08:44.754]  Start winning!
[02:08:44.754 --> 02:08:48.616]  Stop accepting the left's rules, because the left has no rules.
[02:08:50.465 --> 02:08:56.909]  The left is like, they seek power like water from a high place seeks a low place.
[02:08:56.909 --> 02:09:00.391]  They just, whatever.
[02:09:00.391 --> 02:09:07.475]  Joe Biden, you can watch these videos that make you feel like space aliens are breeding right under your skin.
[02:09:07.475 --> 02:09:18.962]  Joe Biden is on video grabbing everything, aged in the single digits, as they try to wriggle away like some kid in space alien movies.
[02:09:18.962 --> 02:09:19.703]  That's pretty close.
[02:09:21.138 --> 02:09:22.959]  This is who the left loves!
[02:09:22.959 --> 02:09:24.320]  We've got no problem with these guys!
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:27.022]  Think they care about children and the girls?
[02:09:27.022 --> 02:09:31.064]  If they cared about children, why would there be a national debt?
[02:09:31.064 --> 02:09:35.366]  If they cared about children, why would there be all these unfunded liabilities running into hundreds of trillions of dollars?
[02:09:35.366 --> 02:09:45.593]  Why would they be selling children off to Chinese banksters for 12 extra votes?
[02:09:45.593 --> 02:09:49.055]  If they ever talk about inappropriate touching of the young,
[02:09:49.858 --> 02:09:52.139]  How about an abortion forcep?
[02:09:52.139 --> 02:09:57.860]  They just... We'll talk about that another time.
[02:09:57.860 --> 02:09:59.120]  This is who the left loves.
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:02.441]  They care about these girls.
[02:10:02.441 --> 02:10:08.282]  Stack all of this stuff that the left accepts and loves and praises.
[02:10:08.282 --> 02:10:12.884]  But Roy Moore, you see, he signed a yearbook.
[02:10:12.884 --> 02:10:14.184]  He signed a yearbook in
[02:10:15.319 --> 02:10:16.480]  December of the next year.
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:17.840]  Oh!
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:19.962]  And he signed it as Ray, not Roy.
[02:10:19.962 --> 02:10:20.662]  Oh!
[02:10:20.662 --> 02:10:21.062]  Oh!
[02:10:21.062 --> 02:10:22.683]  And he signed it D.A.
[02:10:22.683 --> 02:10:27.226]  when he was, at the time, in fact, D.B.A., Deputy District Attorney.
[02:10:27.226 --> 02:10:31.988]  Oh, and also he got the name of the restaurant he was referring to wrong.
[02:10:31.988 --> 02:10:36.231]  And one of his accusers says, oh, he locked me in a car, I couldn't get out, the locks were childproof.
[02:10:36.231 --> 02:10:40.233]  Well, this was 1977, child locks weren't required until the 1980s.
[02:10:40.233 --> 02:10:40.273]  So...
[02:10:44.505 --> 02:10:48.268]  That's all proof, right?
[02:10:48.268 --> 02:10:51.892]  They had Clinton dead to rights.
[02:10:51.892 --> 02:11:02.701]  He had a major news network holding off an interview with Winnie the Pooh Broderick, who says Bill Clinton raped her, until after the impeachment hearings.
[02:11:02.701 --> 02:11:08.246]  They're perfectly happy to cover up this kind of stuff.
[02:11:08.246 --> 02:11:11.048]  But he signed a yearbook.
[02:11:11.048 --> 02:11:11.529]  You understand?
[02:11:12.975 --> 02:11:16.817]  If you don't fight this, it's gonna be raining rape in 2018.
[02:11:16.817 --> 02:11:22.980]  Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape.
[02:11:22.980 --> 02:11:28.483]  You're gonna be like those sad, paralyzed little baby goats.
[02:11:28.483 --> 02:11:30.725]  Boo!
[02:11:30.725 --> 02:11:34.407]  Legs up, don't move.
[02:11:34.407 --> 02:11:36.828]  That's the word that does it, rape.
[02:11:36.828 --> 02:11:41.010]  Inappropriate sexual assault.
[02:11:41.010 --> 02:11:42.231]  The Democrats don't care.
[02:11:43.604 --> 02:11:51.330]  About this stuff, because they praise so many people who've done infinitely worse than what Moore is accused of.
[02:11:51.330 --> 02:11:53.231]  They don't care.
[02:11:53.231 --> 02:11:59.236]  And so in the Darwinian underworld of modern politics, they win!
[02:12:01.288 --> 02:12:02.429]  That's right.
[02:12:02.429 --> 02:12:11.894]  And joining us is Stephan Molyneux live and in the flesh on this Monday, the 20th day of November 2017 to cover the waterfront.
[02:12:11.894 --> 02:12:14.595]  And let's just continue the time we have left in this short segment.
[02:12:14.595 --> 02:12:24.040]  If we were watching this like a football game or like a battle between Lord Wellington and Napoleon, I mean, whatever the case would be, where are we at this point?
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:30.504]  And why do the Republican leadership want to be patted on the head by mainstream media when it's a dying
[02:12:31.798 --> 02:12:36.543]  Anachronism that they should be running from.
[02:12:36.543 --> 02:12:37.043]  Why?
[02:12:37.043 --> 02:12:49.455]  I mean, I think it's because they've been mummified up there and they've all been selected previously because they were such yes men and because they don't think and because they really are tied into the matrix.
[02:12:51.348 --> 02:12:55.792]  Well, in general, it's a crime gang in Congress.
[02:12:55.792 --> 02:13:11.208]  They do things that are immoral and horrible, and I have a pretty strong inkling and feeling, Alex, that we're going to see happen to Congress what recently happened to Hollywood in terms of the blowout of sexual harassment allegations, and probably worse.
[02:13:11.972 --> 02:13:15.054]  So they are in for the full Weinstein treatment, I think, coming up.
[02:13:15.054 --> 02:13:24.101]  There is rumblings on Twitter that this is all coming because, of course, they've been paying off, what is it, $15 million in slush money taxpayer-funded funds to keep women quiet.
[02:13:24.101 --> 02:13:25.842]  In over 250 cases.
[02:13:25.842 --> 02:13:29.185]  Yeah, and I want to know who these people are as an American.
[02:13:30.097 --> 02:13:32.859]  Voter, you should really want to know who these people are.
[02:13:32.859 --> 02:13:34.200]  Who are you voting for?
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:35.281]  Who has stuff on them?
[02:13:35.281 --> 02:13:41.766]  Do you think that a congressperson can be independent if they've been subject to this kind of star chamber review?
[02:13:41.766 --> 02:13:46.369]  If they've been subject to allegations that are paid off in terms of sexual harassment or worse?
[02:13:46.369 --> 02:13:47.190]  They're not independent!
[02:13:47.190 --> 02:13:48.531]  People got stuff on them!
[02:13:48.531 --> 02:13:52.094]  Can they vote according to their independent conscience if they can be blackmailed with this stuff?
[02:13:52.094 --> 02:13:52.414]  I don't know!
[02:13:53.121 --> 02:13:53.801]  I doubt it!
[02:13:53.801 --> 02:13:56.502]  So we really need to see this kind of stuff.
[02:13:56.502 --> 02:14:06.966]  And all of these people acted in these terrible ways with no idea that people like you and I were going to ride up on our little ponies of truth and start shooting the flares of illumination into the sky.
[02:14:06.966 --> 02:14:09.327]  So all of this is old school behavior.
[02:14:09.327 --> 02:14:11.388]  It's horse and buggy crap.
[02:14:11.388 --> 02:14:17.290]  Without the alternative media to hold their feet to the fire, to keep speaking truth to power, these guys would have got away with it.
[02:14:17.290 --> 02:14:20.832]  And imagine how much they would have got away with it if Hillary was in power.
[02:14:21.578 --> 02:14:25.401]  Well that's some footage I've got coming up just in the next segment.
[02:14:25.401 --> 02:14:38.131]  We have Hillary supporters that are book signing, attacking our female reporter, grabbing her mic, hissing, screaming, and these are like 40, 50, 60 year old women, hissing and going crazy and acting like animals.
[02:14:38.131 --> 02:14:43.435]  It's like the left has degenerated so much.
[02:14:43.435 --> 02:14:45.196]  They are terribly lazy.
[02:14:45.996 --> 02:14:50.540]  They are like Olympic swimmers who've spent their entire life training swimming with the current.
[02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:53.262]  With a jetpack and a motorboat and water skis.
[02:14:53.262 --> 02:15:08.796]  I mean, because they've had the mainstream media on their side, they've had government schools on their side, they've had academia on their side, they've had Hollywood on their side, they really haven't had to formulate a really good argument against strong and rigorous intellectual opposition for the last 50-odd years.
[02:15:09.436 --> 02:15:13.340]  The last time someone came up with a good argument against him was Joseph McCarthy!
[02:15:13.340 --> 02:15:14.421]  And look what happened to him.
[02:15:14.421 --> 02:15:21.987]  They had enough control of the media to destroy that man's life and to cover up all of the communists who were in the State Department and other areas of government.
[02:15:21.987 --> 02:15:23.849]  So, they're lazy!
[02:15:23.849 --> 02:15:34.038]  And the people who've been swimming against the current, we've really sharpened our intellectual weapons and we are tanned, fit, rested, relaxed with Bruce Lee bellies and ready to rock and roll.
[02:15:34.038 --> 02:15:36.440]  So we are unfortunately outclassing them enormously.
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:43.326]  And when you think you're all that, and then you run up against the real opponent, the inevitable response is a kind of strangled panic.
[02:15:43.326 --> 02:15:43.886]  That's it.
[02:15:43.886 --> 02:15:47.149]  I mean, they're like grounding rats, is what it looks like.
[02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:51.053]  Just flailing around, squeaking, and pissing themselves.

[02:18:57.613 --> 02:19:01.934]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:19:04.878 --> 02:19:09.521]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[02:19:09.521 --> 02:19:11.843]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:19:11.843 --> 02:19:13.644]  B vitamins we need every day.

[02:19:26.853 --> 02:19:28.715]  Secret 12.
[02:19:28.715 --> 02:19:29.855]  Optimal absorption.
[02:19:29.855 --> 02:19:34.879]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[02:19:34.879 --> 02:19:40.083]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[02:19:40.083 --> 02:19:40.924]  Optimum levels.
[02:19:41.644 --> 02:19:43.785]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:17.923 --> 02:20:22.805]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:20:22.805 --> 02:20:31.749]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:20:36.773 --> 02:20:39.914]  Stefan Molyneux of Free Domain Radio is our guest.
[02:20:39.914 --> 02:20:41.155]  He's also an author, researcher.
[02:20:41.155 --> 02:20:42.935]  We'll tell you about his book and more.
[02:20:42.935 --> 02:20:46.677]  Before I go any further, I want to be clear.
[02:20:46.677 --> 02:20:49.018]  I'm not a tribalist.
[02:20:49.018 --> 02:20:55.640]  George W. Bush, twice for me trying to ask questions, had me arrested on his orders.
[02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:56.960]  Once in New York, once here in Austin.
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:01.082]  I was later told.
[02:21:01.082 --> 02:21:02.483]  I don't like the Republican bluebloods.
[02:21:02.483 --> 02:21:04.283]  I want to get rid of them.
[02:21:04.283 --> 02:21:06.144]  But leftist ideology
[02:21:07.912 --> 02:21:13.924]  Going back to the Jacobins and their French Revolution, if you study it, is really the mindset of Charlie Manson.
[02:21:14.847 --> 02:21:20.972]  His clips about global warming, and his clips about world government, and his clips about killing people, and how he's an elitist.
[02:21:20.972 --> 02:21:23.114]  He was involved in a CIA program.
[02:21:23.114 --> 02:21:26.697]  He was there at the same time as Theodore Kaczynski, who was in the MKUltra program.
[02:21:26.697 --> 02:21:28.658]  That's LA Times, by the way.
[02:21:28.658 --> 02:21:29.939]  They were involved in the occult.
[02:21:29.939 --> 02:21:31.580]  They were going to be the ruling class.
[02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:38.686]  They were involved with all the big, rich, powerful baronesses and heirs, and he was mad because they were kicking him out of that club.
[02:21:38.686 --> 02:21:42.049]  When he set up his own little cult, so he just went and killed a bunch of people to get back at them.
[02:21:43.257 --> 02:21:43.737]  We know that.
[02:21:43.737 --> 02:21:44.918]  I covered it last hour.
[02:21:44.918 --> 02:21:45.798]  Went over all the evidence.
[02:21:45.798 --> 02:21:54.322]  But when you hear what he's saying all those years ago, it's what Antifa's saying today, but they weren't this deranged.
[02:21:54.322 --> 02:22:00.225]  They had a lot of well-meaning liberals that were well-spoken, involved, and really were against police brutality, and really were against real racism.
[02:22:01.235 --> 02:22:05.897]  And now they just mutated into something a thousand times worse than I thought.
[02:22:05.897 --> 02:22:11.599]  Race-baiting and culture-dividing and shaving cream companies saying it's bad to be a man.
[02:22:11.599 --> 02:22:14.420]  That article's up on Infowars.com with the video.
[02:22:14.420 --> 02:22:16.721]  Toxic masculinity everywhere.
[02:22:16.721 --> 02:22:17.781]  Genocide the whites.
[02:22:17.781 --> 02:22:18.882]  It's a good thing.
[02:22:18.882 --> 02:22:22.523]  Trump gets the black players out of prison in China.
[02:22:22.523 --> 02:22:25.044]  Their dads, you know, like, screw you.
[02:22:25.044 --> 02:22:27.885]  It's just a frothingness.
[02:22:27.885 --> 02:22:29.566]  So when I coined the term left-right paradigm,
[02:22:31.078 --> 02:22:33.600]  I meant they control us within fighting left-right.
[02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:36.063]  We should get out of it and just be pro-human.
[02:22:36.063 --> 02:22:42.849]  But now it really is a left-right issue in that the globalists went for broke with leftist ideology worldwide because it's collectivist.
[02:22:42.849 --> 02:22:43.690]  And that's what they want.
[02:22:43.690 --> 02:22:49.595]  And now it's metastasized, gone rogue in many ways, and has literally gone insane.
[02:22:50.556 --> 02:22:58.900]  And I don't know where it's going now as they rampage and try to stop recovery, as the EU implodes, and as this battle is joined.
[02:22:58.900 --> 02:23:03.242]  Stefan, I mean, what would you call this time historically?
[02:23:03.242 --> 02:23:10.346]  It is a time of the first potential pushback against the spread of state force and state power in the history of the world.
[02:23:10.346 --> 02:23:12.867]  Somebody asked me the other day, Alex, it's an interesting question.
[02:23:12.867 --> 02:23:14.308]  They said, have you ever
[02:23:15.140 --> 02:23:30.450]  Notice the unknown of a country that has turned back from ever-increasing state power without going through some massive collapse and some massive godforsaken Venezuela-style, you know, hunting pigeons in the town square and rats in the sewer, fundamental decay, and it's really hard to think of one.
[02:23:30.450 --> 02:23:35.513]  But, but we do have this conversation, we have this capacity to reach the masses.
[02:23:35.513 --> 02:23:38.875]  Absent of gatekeepers, we can bypass everyone who's supposed to keep the truth
[02:23:39.435 --> 02:23:40.016]  From the public.
[02:23:54.697 --> 02:23:56.358]  With Trump and with other people and so on.
[02:23:56.358 --> 02:24:01.000]  So there is this pushback, never in history has it ever been successful.
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:11.106]  Basically people have had to twiddle their thumbs, cry their tears and break their hearts as society slides off the abyss and then cross their fingers that in a couple of hundred years we can get civilization back.
[02:24:11.106 --> 02:24:21.011]  Now for the first time we have the capacity to put the brakes on the inevitable tsunami of escalating state power and really if you have the capacity to do that, that's all you should be doing these days.
[02:24:22.051 --> 02:24:38.242]  So, not only do the tyrants have technology to manipulate, we now have technology that keeps boomeranging back on them, and their plans don't go the way they want more and more, and now humanity is learning from its mistakes, and most of the so-called minorities I talk to are not racist idiots.
[02:24:38.242 --> 02:24:39.904]  They know about the manipulation.
[02:24:39.904 --> 02:24:41.365]  It's fake polls.
[02:24:41.365 --> 02:24:42.405]  It's disinfo.
[02:24:42.405 --> 02:24:44.887]  Just like during the election, that's why they're panicking.
[02:24:44.887 --> 02:24:46.028]  They know they're losing control.
[02:24:47.822 --> 02:24:50.623]  Well, what people need are simple facts.
[02:24:50.623 --> 02:25:01.327]  And what we hope, I think, through providing simple facts and reason and evidence to people as a whole, is we can get them to have their love overcome their fear.
[02:25:01.327 --> 02:25:05.588]  This is going to sound all kinds of Hallmark sort of style squishy, but I think it's really, really important.
[02:25:06.048 --> 02:25:10.289]  There are people who, there is the left, and then there are the people who are the scared of the left.
[02:25:10.289 --> 02:25:15.071]  And those are the majority Republicans, you know, prior to Trump and the Never Trumpers and so on.
[02:25:15.071 --> 02:25:22.534]  So there are other people on the left who openly admit that they'll use any satanic method that they can through their Satan Prince Saul Alinsky.
[02:25:22.534 --> 02:25:23.634]  They've been very honest about this.
[02:25:23.634 --> 02:25:26.035]  They'll use whatever power, whatever manipulations they can.
[02:25:26.035 --> 02:25:28.115]  They have no standards, just to gain power.
[02:25:28.115 --> 02:25:31.576]  So there's the left, the hard left, and then there are those who are scared of the left.
[02:25:31.576 --> 02:25:32.397]  They're a power cult.
[02:25:32.397 --> 02:25:32.557]  Yeah.
[02:25:33.237 --> 02:25:42.947]  They're power cults, and so the left want our blood, the left want our subjugation, and those who are scared of the left are hoping to appease them to buy a decade or two of peace.
[02:25:42.947 --> 02:25:48.233]  Well, the decade or two was a decade or two ago, and no more appeasement is going to work.
[02:25:48.233 --> 02:25:50.415]  It's going to all happen within our lifetime.
[02:25:50.935 --> 02:26:05.869]  So I want to bring people to love freedom more than they fear the abusers, more than they fear the people who can harm you, more than they fear the abuse of the media or of social media, more than they fear what they can lose from people attacking them unjustly.
[02:26:05.869 --> 02:26:10.873]  And we see people, you know, Trump waded through endless accusations of abuse and racism and sexism.
[02:26:10.873 --> 02:26:13.856]  We've got Roy Moore who's not backing down or backing out.
[02:26:14.457 --> 02:26:17.100]  Of what I think are unfounded allegations against him.
[02:26:17.100 --> 02:26:20.544]  We have to show people how love can overcome fear.
[02:26:20.544 --> 02:26:32.599]  How love of freedom, love of the future, love of our civilization, love of our history, love of our children, that is the only power that can overcome the fear that will get us all plowed under in the usual socialist expansion in history.
[02:26:33.746 --> 02:26:34.587]  You're absolutely right.
[02:26:34.587 --> 02:26:39.610]  You've always got these socialist, Jacobin, Illuminati expansionists who are the opposite of eliminating people.
[02:26:39.610 --> 02:26:45.474]  They're the counterfeit of what you call the Enlightenment and Francis Bacon and all the rest of it.
[02:26:45.474 --> 02:26:48.696]  And they are just dedicated, they'll tell you, to dominating you.
[02:26:48.696 --> 02:26:50.317]  They don't even want a civilization.
[02:26:50.317 --> 02:26:53.780]  They want to gouge our eyes out, turn our skulls into goblets.
[02:26:54.460 --> 02:27:01.301]  And then drink up all the wine and sit on top of a pile of skulls and not even care that more wine doesn't come because they burned down the vineyards.
[02:27:01.301 --> 02:27:04.222]  It's the same thing we see in Africa, killing all the white farmers.
[02:27:04.222 --> 02:27:13.224]  It's just a power lust to have that minute of power gouging somebody's eyes out, even though you're going to starve to death in two weeks.
[02:27:13.224 --> 02:27:17.485]  Once somebody has admitted to you, Alex, that they'd have no principles,
[02:27:18.308 --> 02:27:21.631]  Then there is no end to their escalation of destruction.
[02:27:21.631 --> 02:27:22.412]  And we've seen this.
[02:27:22.412 --> 02:27:34.482]  We've seen this in the French Revolution, where you have thousands of priests and nuns dragged out of monasteries and churches and chapels and eyes gouged out, throats slit, heads cut off in the streets.
[02:27:34.902 --> 02:27:43.173]  We saw this in Cambodia where the first thing they did was target anybody with an intelligence above 100 and arguments above medievalism.
[02:27:43.173 --> 02:27:44.634]  They dragged them out into the cities.
[02:27:44.634 --> 02:27:46.036]  They forced them to become farmers.
[02:27:46.036 --> 02:27:47.057]  Everyone starves to death.
[02:27:47.057 --> 02:27:50.522]  We saw this in the Ukraine under Stalin and the Holodomor when they...
[02:27:51.102 --> 02:27:59.248]  Collectivized all the farms, gave all of the farm machinery to incompetent people, killed off all of the rich and competent farmers, and then millions and millions of people starved to death.
[02:27:59.248 --> 02:28:00.509]  We saw this in China.
[02:28:00.509 --> 02:28:02.571]  Tens of millions of people slaughtered.
[02:28:02.571 --> 02:28:06.874]  We saw this in North Korea, where it's basically one giant open-air prison camp.
[02:28:06.874 --> 02:28:10.497]  There is no end to the escalation of the aggression they will use.
[02:28:10.497 --> 02:28:18.883]  This is why we have to not just oppose the evil that is coming, but show the light of love and reason and happiness and joy.
[02:28:18.883 --> 02:28:19.704]  And that is the light.
[02:28:19.944 --> 02:28:21.547]  By which we must drive back the darkness.
[02:28:21.547 --> 02:28:30.640]  Because there's an old saying that has really stuck with me from Nietzsche where he said, when you confront monsters, when you face down monsters, be careful that you yourself does not become a monster.
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:34.786]  We must oppose the evil but guide ourselves by the good as much as possible.
[02:28:34.906 --> 02:28:38.249]  Because when you stare into the abyss, a lot of times you become the abyss.
[02:28:38.249 --> 02:28:41.953]  We'll be back with Stefan Molyneux, who again is on fire, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:41.953 --> 02:28:44.495]  We'll cover a bunch of big breaking news with him.
[02:28:44.495 --> 02:28:46.517]  And get into all these words they're trying to ban.
[02:28:46.517 --> 02:28:50.181]  Facebook told us, you use the word tranny, you're banned.
[02:28:50.181 --> 02:28:51.942]  But then the left can use it all they want.
[02:28:51.942 --> 02:28:53.044]  I mean, this is true discrimination.
[02:28:53.666 --> 02:28:58.929]  Have you ever lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[02:28:58.929 --> 02:29:04.292]  If so, pay close attention because huge discounts are now available in solar generators.
[02:29:04.292 --> 02:29:07.334]  Perfect for backup power outages and emergencies.
[02:29:07.334 --> 02:29:12.857]  Portable solar generators provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most.
[02:29:12.857 --> 02:29:22.303]  And, unlike gas generators, a solar generator runs quietly, emits no dangerous fumes, and produces an endless supply of electricity from the sun.
[02:29:22.563 --> 02:29:26.644]  It's like having an electric power plant running secretly in your own home.
[02:29:26.644 --> 02:29:33.545]  Right now, get a $5,000 solar generator for just $995 while supplies last.

[02:29:54.605 --> 02:30:14.577]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:30:14.577 --> 02:30:16.699]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:30:16.699 --> 02:30:20.701]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:30:20.701 --> 02:30:21.722]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[02:30:22.142 --> 02:30:27.926]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:30:27.926 --> 02:30:30.328]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:30:30.328 --> 02:30:35.751]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:30:35.751 --> 02:30:38.253]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:30:38.253 --> 02:30:47.439]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:30:47.439 --> 02:30:51.862]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:30:55.043 --> 02:30:58.165]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:30:58.165 --> 02:31:05.588]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[02:31:05.588 --> 02:31:11.170]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:31:11.971 --> 02:31:19.640]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:31:19.640 --> 02:31:27.530]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:33.294]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[02:31:33.294 --> 02:31:35.416]  They are the anti-liberals.
[02:31:35.416 --> 02:31:48.807]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:48.807 --> 02:31:52.791]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:53.940 --> 02:31:55.822]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:31:55.822 --> 02:31:57.143]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:31:57.143 --> 02:31:58.344]  Why is this so good?
[02:31:58.344 --> 02:32:03.628]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:32:03.628 --> 02:32:17.179]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:32:17.179 --> 02:32:18.541]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:32:19.301 --> 02:32:20.963]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:32:20.963 --> 02:32:23.465]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:32:23.465 --> 02:32:24.826]  These are all parasites.
[02:32:24.826 --> 02:32:25.927]  Tell us about all the stuff it says.
[02:32:25.927 --> 02:32:27.288]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:27.288 --> 02:32:31.791]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bug, the organic wormwood.
[02:32:31.791 --> 02:32:34.934]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:32:35.014 --> 02:32:38.096]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:32:38.096 --> 02:32:39.156]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:32:39.156 --> 02:32:41.097]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:41.097 --> 02:32:42.117]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:32:42.117 --> 02:32:44.819]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:32:44.819 --> 02:32:48.080]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:48.080 --> 02:32:50.341]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:32:50.341 --> 02:32:56.825]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:32:56.825 --> 02:32:59.446]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:07.572 --> 02:33:10.134]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:10.134 --> 02:33:22.461]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:22.461 --> 02:33:25.022]  We can rebuild him.
[02:33:25.022 --> 02:33:26.143]  Better than he was before.
[02:33:26.143 --> 02:33:29.465]  We have the technology.
[02:33:29.465 --> 02:33:32.687]  We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man.
[02:33:41.937 --> 02:33:55.972]  Alright folks, we'll see if we can rebuild the Republic and make it better and then everybody wants to come here because it's not perfect.
[02:33:55.972 --> 02:33:57.374]  You can sure point all day at our...
[02:33:59.071 --> 02:34:00.231]  Wrongs and our problems.
[02:34:00.231 --> 02:34:01.872]  But then why does everybody want to get here?
[02:34:01.872 --> 02:34:03.992]  Because there was a little bit more freedom.
[02:34:03.992 --> 02:34:05.853]  And a little bit more leave me alone.
[02:34:05.853 --> 02:34:07.913]  And suddenly you've got all these choices.
[02:34:07.913 --> 02:34:09.494]  And suddenly you've got all these doctors.
[02:34:09.494 --> 02:34:11.154]  And suddenly you've got all these vacations.
[02:34:11.154 --> 02:34:14.215]  And suddenly you've got all these new appliances.
[02:34:14.215 --> 02:34:15.435]  And suddenly you live longer.
[02:34:15.435 --> 02:34:18.416]  And everybody then points at it and says, it's evil!
[02:34:18.416 --> 02:34:18.876]  It's evil!
[02:34:18.876 --> 02:34:20.116]  Get rid of it!
[02:34:20.116 --> 02:34:20.996]  Obama says, that's right.
[02:34:20.996 --> 02:34:24.717]  You can't have cars or air conditioning if you're in Africa.
[02:34:24.717 --> 02:34:26.938]  How is that not the most racist thing we've ever heard?
[02:34:28.359 --> 02:34:48.495]  So what you've got is a bunch of kleptocrats who want to use the tidal forces of human nature, tribalism, and have a new reverse colonialism, but not for the people of the third world invading the West to actually share in the spoils, because that's the plan, is to have people come here and work and live and make things better.
[02:34:48.495 --> 02:34:50.717]  No, to come here to politically conquer it.
[02:34:53.524 --> 02:35:03.133]  Stefan Molyneux, I've been asking a lot of questions and I've got a ton of news here I want to go over with you, but what else is on your radar screen you want to impart to the viewers?
[02:35:03.133 --> 02:35:14.903]  Yeah, I was thinking about this, you know, calling the police on words that people find offensive and so on, and I was just thinking over the break, Alex, you know what I really, really want, and I think I speak for a lot of people in this
[02:35:17.075 --> 02:35:18.877]  I want a little bit of breathing room.
[02:35:18.877 --> 02:35:22.439]  I feel like we're all kind of getting squished up together with this political correctness.
[02:35:22.439 --> 02:35:31.165]  You know, it's like, if I was doing the interview and I like, I had the camera like right up here, be a little, little claustrophobic, little, little bit of an invasion in personal space.
[02:35:31.165 --> 02:35:32.806]  And I really, really want some space.
[02:35:32.806 --> 02:35:36.829]  I want, like if people want to change their gender, just don't force me to pay for it.
[02:35:36.829 --> 02:35:40.852]  If people are irresponsible with their sexuality, just don't force me to pay for it.
[02:35:40.852 --> 02:35:43.514]  If people would rather play video games and learn some job skill,
[02:35:44.094 --> 02:35:46.277]  Let them live with the lower wages.
[02:35:46.277 --> 02:35:48.700]  Let's have a little bit of space.
[02:35:48.700 --> 02:35:54.606]  Let's have a little bit of personal privacy for our money, for our thoughts, for our opinions.
[02:35:54.606 --> 02:35:58.511]  If you disagree with someone in the public square and it really bothers you, go engage them.
[02:35:59.031 --> 02:36:00.151]  Mind to mind.
[02:36:00.151 --> 02:36:01.552]  Verbal battle to verbal battle.
[02:36:01.552 --> 02:36:04.893]  Don't call the police on a word you find upsetting.
[02:36:04.893 --> 02:36:09.394]  That is very claustrophobic and that's saying that we don't have any personal space anymore.
[02:36:09.394 --> 02:36:11.255]  We don't have any privacy for our wallet.
[02:36:11.255 --> 02:36:13.335]  We don't have any privacy for our communications.
[02:36:13.335 --> 02:36:15.676]  We don't have any privacy for being offensive.
[02:36:16.096 --> 02:36:23.080]  And who on earth is to say that the person who is the most offensive now might not be the person who gives us the biggest moral breakthrough in the future?
[02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:27.263]  Slavery, anti-slavery was highly offensive to people when it first came out.
[02:36:27.263 --> 02:36:32.546]  Who on earth has the omniscience to know that what is offensive now might not be moral tomorrow?
[02:36:32.546 --> 02:36:40.331]  Well, the old left has said, hey, I may disagree with you, but I'll fight the death for you to say it, because political speech and unpopular speech is the most protected.
[02:36:40.331 --> 02:36:41.572]  And of course, you're talking about the article.
[02:36:42.832 --> 02:36:45.673]  College calls police on student who said tranny.
[02:36:45.673 --> 02:36:49.794]  They arrest you if you don't use the G or Z or whatever the new cult words are.
[02:36:49.794 --> 02:36:50.715]  How about a cult?
[02:36:50.715 --> 02:36:52.195]  No longer use mother or father.
[02:36:52.195 --> 02:36:53.216]  We have words for you.
[02:36:53.216 --> 02:36:54.216]  Use this.
[02:36:54.216 --> 02:36:55.576]  It's a revolution.
[02:36:55.576 --> 02:36:56.797]  They know what they're doing.
[02:36:57.677 --> 02:37:27.377]  And so, they talk about their local Antifa group at this Minnesota college, and it's called Devil Worshipping Queers, and notice, the gay folks can use the word queer all day, I don't care, but then somebody else says, hey, they're having their queer rally, it's the name of the rally, and I've had strikes on my YouTube for saying they had this, you know, the such-and-such queer rally, which is the name of the rally, but then I can't say the name of the rally, because they're, it's like a god complex with the left, and they're using these little subgroups then to be the little victims to where,
[02:37:27.897 --> 02:37:30.499]  But Tranny's came up with the name Tranny.
[02:37:30.499 --> 02:37:32.380]  That's the name they gave themselves.
[02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:34.441]  I looked it up and I looked up where it came from.
[02:37:34.441 --> 02:37:38.283]  This year, Facebook decided it's hateful.
[02:37:38.283 --> 02:37:39.664]  They banned it.
[02:37:39.664 --> 02:37:44.186]  And so now everyone else is saying it's an FCC word when it's not.
[02:37:44.186 --> 02:37:49.389]  And it's just like incredible that I had Facebook.
[02:37:50.407 --> 02:37:52.529]  So we're going to shut you down and ban you on Facebook.
[02:37:52.529 --> 02:37:54.931]  But we want to have one of our executives talk to you.
[02:37:54.931 --> 02:37:55.652]  And I couldn't believe it.
[02:37:55.652 --> 02:37:58.194]  It was the head of the quote, Facebook brands.
[02:37:58.194 --> 02:37:59.135]  So we get the phone call.
[02:37:59.135 --> 02:38:00.657]  We go, we're recording this.
[02:38:00.657 --> 02:38:01.998]  Rob, you and us are in there.
[02:38:01.998 --> 02:38:02.799]  We haven't played it yet.
[02:38:02.799 --> 02:38:03.679]  And then they don't even listen to us.
[02:38:03.679 --> 02:38:06.122]  They go, OK, well, just don't just just paraphrase me.
[02:38:06.122 --> 02:38:06.682]  And then they go.
[02:38:07.623 --> 02:38:09.383]  Just don't use that word.
[02:38:09.383 --> 02:38:10.904]  But what if I'm reading a news headline?
[02:38:10.904 --> 02:38:18.045]  They just go, I'll call you back in a few days and we're going to give you a full list of all the words you can't use.
[02:38:18.045 --> 02:38:19.486]  Well, they never called us back.
[02:38:19.486 --> 02:38:25.067]  So, I mean, I'm on a phone call with an executive telling me don't say tranny.
[02:38:25.067 --> 02:38:27.968]  Tranny, tranny, tranny, tranny, tranny, tranny, tranny, tranny.
[02:38:27.968 --> 02:38:31.729]  I mean, again, folks, this is such a war on words.
[02:38:31.729 --> 02:38:32.309]  It's crazy.
[02:38:32.309 --> 02:38:32.749]  What do you think?
[02:38:34.133 --> 02:38:37.997]  Well, this is what happens when you get multiculturalism.
[02:38:37.997 --> 02:38:43.703]  Often, so often, Alex devolves into multi-legalism or multi-rules-ism.
[02:38:43.703 --> 02:38:51.211]  You know, multiculturalism is kind of sold like, well, you can get a wide variety of delectable treats on Main Street because there's going to be lots of different kinds of ethnic restaurants.
[02:38:51.952 --> 02:38:55.899]  If you're really into Natasha Atlas, you'll be able to appreciate her music even more.
[02:38:55.899 --> 02:39:01.829]  And it's all this softy-gooey, you know, there'll be different songs, different music, different food, and so on, and that's great.
[02:39:01.829 --> 02:39:04.294]  And that's how it's kind of sold to you, but what actually happens is...
[02:39:05.012 --> 02:39:07.573]  You end up with different rules for different groups.
[02:39:07.573 --> 02:39:10.934]  And they start off as ostracism punishment rules.
[02:39:10.934 --> 02:39:14.055]  And then they escalate to banning on social media rules.
[02:39:14.055 --> 02:39:19.117]  And then they go all the way to legal rules in society.
[02:39:19.117 --> 02:39:21.698]  And you end up with different rules for different groups.
[02:39:21.698 --> 02:39:22.758]  No objective standards.
[02:39:22.758 --> 02:39:25.539]  You go from multiculturalism to multilegalism.
[02:39:26.039 --> 02:39:37.684]  Where protected groups have different sentences, protected groups have different rules, and, you know, the n-word can be used by rappers, but not by anyone else, and this word can be used by this group, but if this group uses it, it's horrible and opposing.
[02:39:37.684 --> 02:39:42.987]  You get this fragmented, broken mirror of opposing methodologies, and it breaks society apart.
[02:39:42.987 --> 02:39:44.447]  It's total discrimination, too.
[02:39:44.447 --> 02:39:47.829]  It creates new classes, as you just said, and they know what they're doing.
[02:39:49.341 --> 02:39:58.752]  This incredible balkanization, which results in the self-policing of people and the hostile opposition to other groups.
[02:39:58.752 --> 02:40:04.860]  Because if you have to self-police all the time, if you're a white male, say for instance, you're not in any protected group,
[02:40:05.460 --> 02:40:26.646]  So many white males, I just did this video on masculinity as a whole, and so many white males are feeling like, well I can't say this and I can't apply for this job because it says are you part of a minority or are you a woman when you apply for this job and I know if I don't check that off I'm never getting to the interview phase and I can't say this and everyone's gonna attack me for that and what happens is then you see these other groups who seem to be getting away with astonishingly
[02:40:27.385 --> 02:40:40.574]  Huge breaks in these rules, and there's this frustration with your own inhibited state, and then there's this mounting resentment against other people who flout these rules with impunity, and this is how they set us against each other.
[02:40:40.574 --> 02:40:45.318]  Create these rules, have them apply... Exactly, it's meant to create racial... 500 of these, minus 500 of these.
[02:40:45.318 --> 02:40:46.458]  It's meant to create racial division.
[02:40:46.458 --> 02:40:49.100]  And then we end up resenting each other and fighting each other.
[02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:50.501]  It's meant to create racial division.
[02:40:50.501 --> 02:40:52.863]  Exactly, the endgame is all of us hating each other.
[02:40:54.221 --> 02:41:01.106]  And it's such a shame, because if we all agree to submit to reason and evidence, we can have very positive and productive and enjoyable discussions.
[02:41:01.106 --> 02:41:09.311]  But we're turning into, it's like a science conference, where you've got tarot cards and voodoo as to whose conjecture or hypothesis becomes validated.
[02:41:09.311 --> 02:41:09.571]  No!
[02:41:09.571 --> 02:41:15.355]  We need reason and evidence, because if we simply bow to political correctness, we are going to tear ourselves apart!
[02:41:15.835 --> 02:41:16.716]  As a society.
[02:41:16.716 --> 02:41:20.558]  And those of us who can see the tears coming are desperately trying to sew them back together.
[02:41:20.558 --> 02:41:27.043]  But there's lots of people out there with scimitars just slashing away at the entire tapestry and fabric of what holds us together as societies.
[02:41:27.043 --> 02:41:34.848]  And we must do everything we can to prevent that from happening because what's on the other side of that tapestry is a whole lot of blood and bones.
[02:41:34.848 --> 02:41:35.668]  A hundred percent.
[02:41:35.668 --> 02:41:36.309]  And you notice
[02:41:37.824 --> 02:41:40.447]  For a long time, the Hollywood elite, the comedians, they were exempt.
[02:41:40.447 --> 02:41:41.548]  They could tell the dirty jokes.
[02:41:41.548 --> 02:41:42.950]  They could just say the racial jokes.
[02:41:42.950 --> 02:41:45.512]  Now they can't either, and they're not liking it.
[02:41:45.512 --> 02:41:55.543]  I mean, this is such a prison that's been built, and it's like a self-perpetuating system that just gets more loony and more crazy.
[02:41:55.543 --> 02:41:56.845]  I mean, I think it's destined to fail.
[02:41:58.283 --> 02:42:02.584]  Well, we do have some bright sparks in all of this, and this all comes out of the alternative media.
[02:42:02.584 --> 02:42:09.386]  The left has traditionally used allegations of sexual misconduct to undermine and cripple their political opponents.
[02:42:09.386 --> 02:42:11.406]  We see that, of course, happening in Alabama.
[02:42:11.406 --> 02:42:18.708]  The plus side is, since now there's an alternative media to bring up Bill Clinton, they're now, on the left, throwing the Clintons under the bus so that they can retain this weapon.
[02:42:19.189 --> 02:42:23.136]  Of sexual allegations against the Republicans or non-leftists.
[02:42:23.136 --> 02:42:29.407]  And anything which diminishes the power of the Clintons in the public sphere, I find it really hard to think of as in any way bad.
[02:42:30.797 --> 02:42:32.858]  All right, Stefan Malin is straight ahead.
[02:42:32.858 --> 02:42:35.078]  I'm going to play some of the banned radio.
[02:42:35.078 --> 02:42:42.700]  The police were called on this to create the color of law that they weren't allowed to even describe the names of the groups.
[02:42:42.700 --> 02:42:45.881]  Because remember, the left's allowed to use all these groups.
[02:42:45.881 --> 02:42:46.921]  You're not.
[02:42:46.921 --> 02:42:48.182]  They said so.
[02:42:48.182 --> 02:42:48.642]  We'll be back.
[02:42:54.406 --> 02:42:59.133]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[02:44:36.929 --> 02:44:38.070]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:41.894]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[02:44:41.894 --> 02:44:43.035]  It is an act of war.
[02:44:43.035 --> 02:44:45.077]  It is an act of standing up.
[02:44:45.077 --> 02:44:50.642]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[02:44:54.322 --> 02:44:59.065]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.

[02:45:54.433 --> 02:45:57.554]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:45:57.554 --> 02:46:04.975]  That's why now more than ever we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullies.
[02:46:04.975 --> 02:46:10.596]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:46:11.356 --> 02:46:19.024]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:46:19.024 --> 02:46:26.932]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:46:27.612 --> 02:46:32.674]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[02:46:32.674 --> 02:46:34.834]  They are the anti-liberals.
[02:46:34.834 --> 02:46:48.199]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:48.199 --> 02:46:52.180]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:57.246 --> 02:46:59.860]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:12.193 --> 02:47:17.437]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Stephan Molyneux is riding shotgun with us today.
[02:47:17.437 --> 02:47:25.364]  Stephan Molyneux has his new book out that I've read, it's excellent, The Art of the Argument, artoftheargument.com.
[02:47:25.364 --> 02:47:30.988]  Be sure and get that and find out more at Free Domain Radio on YouTube while it's still there.
[02:47:30.988 --> 02:47:35.132]  Two weeks ago, congressional hearings, they openly said,
[02:47:37.032 --> 02:47:43.817]  Oh, we saw Paul Watson's article at InfoWars was number one about the attack, saying it was Islamic and that the mayor had been warned.
[02:47:43.817 --> 02:47:45.038]  This is fake news.
[02:47:45.038 --> 02:47:52.423]  And then Twitter, Facebook, Google execs were like, sir, we saw it at lunch and took it down.
[02:47:52.423 --> 02:47:56.506]  And despite all their censorship, we've had five billion views altogether.
[02:47:56.506 --> 02:48:01.349]  I know because YouTube told us, they said, let us monetize all this, but also take most of the other channels down.
[02:48:01.349 --> 02:48:03.551]  You let everybody use your stuff.
[02:48:03.551 --> 02:48:06.033]  But I knew it was just a way to give them the authorization.
[02:48:07.546 --> 02:48:09.206]  to take all material off.
[02:48:09.206 --> 02:48:11.907]  So we don't just have our two, whatever, billion views on our channels.
[02:48:11.907 --> 02:48:12.767]  We have three billion.
[02:48:12.767 --> 02:48:13.567]  That was a couple years ago.
[02:48:13.567 --> 02:48:16.008]  They told us it's like four billion, so I'm guessing it's five billion now.
[02:48:16.008 --> 02:48:17.248]  It's probably way bigger.
[02:48:17.248 --> 02:48:19.349]  They don't like the fact we're way bigger than the Young Turks.
[02:48:19.349 --> 02:48:23.930]  The only thing bigger is something like PewDiePie, who they want to take over because they don't control him.
[02:48:23.930 --> 02:48:26.590]  Even though he's not even political, it's about control.
[02:48:26.590 --> 02:48:28.351]  People don't want their Hollywood garbage.
[02:48:28.351 --> 02:48:30.431]  They don't want their mainstream crap anymore.
[02:48:30.431 --> 02:48:34.352]  You can get a few idiots that do, but people want real diversity and ideas.
[02:48:35.424 --> 02:48:36.765]  But we're under censorship.
[02:48:36.765 --> 02:48:45.308]  That's why you've got to hand-share the links to Infowars.com and the stories and the videos and the live feeds on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, and on other platforms.
[02:48:45.308 --> 02:48:53.431]  It's why you are absolutely authorized to grab our feeds and put them on your Facebook, your Twitter, your YouTube, whatever.
[02:48:53.431 --> 02:48:56.672]  Just get the information out there.
[02:48:56.672 --> 02:48:59.633]  Support our local radio stations.
[02:48:59.633 --> 02:49:00.514]  Become a sponsor.
[02:49:00.514 --> 02:49:01.454]  Support their sponsors.
[02:49:02.682 --> 02:49:03.422]  Support us!
[02:49:03.422 --> 02:49:05.143]  We've got free shipping through this week.
[02:49:05.143 --> 02:49:09.443]  I'm extending because of the Black Friday sales and it got back in stock.
[02:49:09.443 --> 02:49:14.004]  50% off Brain Force, our incredibly popular nootropic.
[02:49:14.004 --> 02:49:16.085]  Brands that are similar are $60 to $70.
[02:49:16.085 --> 02:49:17.085]  It's a deal at $39.
[02:49:17.085 --> 02:49:20.906]  It's $19.95 right now, but it's a small shipment.
[02:49:20.906 --> 02:49:23.146]  We're not going to get more probably until the end of the year.
[02:49:23.146 --> 02:49:25.467]  So Brain Force Plus, 50% off.
[02:49:25.467 --> 02:49:30.328]  We've got some other big specials we're running today as well, but a lot of these specials can only run for a few days.
[02:49:31.827 --> 02:49:40.729]  So, Brain Force Plus is the special we've got today, and 25% off ProPure water filtration systems, and several other big specials.
[02:49:40.729 --> 02:49:42.369]  Don't forget our fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:49:42.369 --> 02:49:43.850]  It's got colloidal silver and iodine in it.
[02:49:43.850 --> 02:49:49.991]  Don't forget we've got our new line of probiotics, Fluorolife and the digestive enzyme for big carnivores.
[02:49:49.991 --> 02:49:50.831]  Carnivore.
[02:49:50.831 --> 02:49:53.092]  Check that out at infowarrestore.com.
[02:49:53.092 --> 02:49:57.413]  And when you get excited about what we're doing, we can get more crew, more people.
[02:49:57.413 --> 02:49:59.353]  We can expand and not be destroyed.
[02:49:59.813 --> 02:50:06.237]  Because we're either going to grow under these attacks, and believe me, they're intense, or we're going to implode.
[02:50:06.237 --> 02:50:08.158]  And I've decided to grow in the face of it.
[02:50:08.158 --> 02:50:09.959]  Big fish eat little fish.
[02:50:09.959 --> 02:50:21.486]  So whether it's highest quality body armor at the best prices, or whether it's books and films and non-GMO heirloom seeds, thousands of great preparedness items at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:50:21.486 --> 02:50:26.589]  And there's several specials we had last week that are about to end.
[02:50:26.589 --> 02:50:28.770]  I don't have time to get into, but, but, but Stefan,
[02:50:30.401 --> 02:50:31.426]  We're really right.
[02:50:31.426 --> 02:50:32.450]  I mean, we're not just...
[02:50:33.601 --> 02:50:35.883]  Here saying all of this.
[02:51:03.541 --> 02:51:03.801]  I don't
[02:51:25.863 --> 02:51:27.905]  This is where I see things, Alex.
[02:51:27.905 --> 02:51:28.646]  We are in a house
[02:51:52.714 --> 02:51:57.976]  The sun is rising, the vampires are beating down the door, but we still have to invite them in.
[02:51:57.976 --> 02:52:02.478]  If we don't invite them in, poof, they turn into ash from the rising sun.
[02:52:02.478 --> 02:52:05.440]  They have missed the opportunity to crush us.
[02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:11.722]  You know, you've been doing this longer than I have, I've been doing it for about 11 years in a public sphere, many years before that in a private sphere.
[02:52:11.722 --> 02:52:17.505]  Back in the day they tried to smash me down, back in the day, and continually they try to smash you down, but it's too late.
[02:52:18.001 --> 02:52:24.419]  We have become too big, there are too many interconnected people, there are too many networks, there are too many freedom lovers who are supporting each other.
[02:52:25.111 --> 02:52:28.713]  Now if they try and smash people down, all they do is raise the profile.
[02:52:28.713 --> 02:52:33.395]  In other words, what I'm saying is, the Liberty Virus, my friends, has gone airborne!
[02:52:33.395 --> 02:52:35.917]  It can no longer be contained.
[02:52:35.917 --> 02:52:39.038]  And that means that it's a wonderful opportunity for everyone out there.
[02:52:39.038 --> 02:52:44.361]  Please do not view the liberation of Western civilization as a spectator sport.
[02:52:44.361 --> 02:52:50.445]  Do not sit there passively in your chair, thumbing your remote and hoping that other people are going to save the world for you.
[02:52:50.445 --> 02:52:53.006]  We have passed the tipping point, the Overton window.
[02:52:53.712 --> 02:52:58.216]  Has gone so far now that what was impossible before has become commonplace now.
[02:52:58.216 --> 02:53:00.999]  What was radical before has become commonplace now.
[02:53:00.999 --> 02:53:12.869]  So I invite and urge everyone, everyone, do not have this incredibly powerful moment in time be nothing more than something you look at and are passively hoping that other people will do for you.
[02:53:12.869 --> 02:53:17.013]  Get up, get involved, support, start something, write something.
[02:53:17.013 --> 02:53:18.614]  It's a webcam and a microphone.
[02:53:18.614 --> 02:53:20.116]  You can do that for 50 bucks.
[02:53:20.908 --> 02:53:27.433]  Really dig deep, find a way to talk passionately about freedom and truth and empathy and fight back against the powers.
[02:53:27.433 --> 02:53:30.536]  Don't let them conquer you.
[02:53:30.536 --> 02:53:32.698]  And don't let other people save you.
[02:53:32.698 --> 02:53:37.101]  You know, there's an old... It was a poster when I was a kid that was around.
[02:53:37.101 --> 02:53:40.804]  And it was a kid looking at his father after the Second World War.
[02:53:40.804 --> 02:53:41.885]  This was during the Second War.
[02:53:42.575 --> 02:53:46.440]  And the kid was saying, Daddy, what did you do in the Great War?
[02:53:46.440 --> 02:53:52.127]  And the kid, the father was like shamefaced and looking down because, I don't know, I guess he didn't really do much of anything.
[02:53:52.127 --> 02:53:55.311]  This is easier, it's much easier than trench warfare.
[02:53:55.311 --> 02:54:01.879]  You know, we know when he's asking us to snort mustard gas into our lungs or, you know, have shells barraged down on our heads, at least yet.
[02:54:02.671 --> 02:54:13.297]  So as much as this is the easiest fight that has ever had for the greatest stakes in human history, and please, please, I beg people on my knees, do not let this opportunity for heroism pass you by.
[02:54:13.297 --> 02:54:16.759]  Self-esteem, self-respect is something that you really have to
[02:54:17.612 --> 02:54:18.212]  Fight for.
[02:54:18.212 --> 02:54:19.352]  It's like health.
[02:54:19.352 --> 02:54:20.393]  It doesn't just happen to you.
[02:54:20.393 --> 02:54:23.693]  You have to take active steps to have pride in yourself.
[02:54:23.693 --> 02:54:29.895]  And there's no greater gift to yourself than acting in a courageous, moral manner against vicious and immoral people.
[02:54:29.895 --> 02:54:32.255]  So, everybody has this opportunity.
[02:54:32.255 --> 02:54:34.076]  The barrier to entry has never been lower.
[02:54:34.076 --> 02:54:35.716]  The stakes have never been higher.
[02:54:35.716 --> 02:54:39.237]  And the fight, frankly, has never been more fun.
[02:54:39.237 --> 02:54:39.577]  Join in.
[02:54:40.523 --> 02:54:41.124]  That's right.
[02:54:41.124 --> 02:54:47.093]  And again, I don't like to demonize our enemies because that's something that means I've got a crutch and I want to feel elitist.
[02:54:47.093 --> 02:54:55.566]  I mean, you know, those of us that have natural compass know that putting somebody else down doesn't make us bigger, but you have to recognize.
[02:54:56.508 --> 02:55:07.659]  At any Hillary event, or any Democrat event, these aren't just antifa events, these are gibbering, hateful people that can hardly talk, and they are lunatics!
[02:55:07.659 --> 02:55:12.164]  And it's getting worse, and it is a mass form of psychosis.
[02:55:12.164 --> 02:55:14.887]  And of course that's been proven in psychology that you don't just have individual psychosis,
[02:55:15.387 --> 02:55:18.648]  Humans are designed that usually somebody in the group must know the right way.
[02:55:18.648 --> 02:55:24.029]  So they're following a bad leader and they won't admit they've been wrong and they won't admit things are serious.
[02:55:24.029 --> 02:55:32.532]  It's like the Germans still thought they were going to win when the Russians were a mile away from the right chancellor and Hitler still thought he was going to win until two days before.
[02:55:32.532 --> 02:55:33.292]  And it just shows.
[02:55:34.472 --> 02:55:36.093]  I kind of got to give it to them though.
[02:55:36.093 --> 02:55:39.656]  They won't give up, but they're becoming caricatures of zombies.
[02:55:39.656 --> 02:55:41.498]  I mean, here's just 10 seconds of this.
[02:55:41.498 --> 02:55:48.463]  We can't show a lot of it because of the radio stations and TV stations and most, I mean, it's been bleeped, but they're flipping everybody off.
[02:55:48.463 --> 02:55:49.564]  They're cussing, screaming.
[02:55:49.564 --> 02:55:57.009]  These are women attacking our female reporter, physically grabbing on her, grabbing the mic, cussing at her for just coming up trying to talk to him about Bill Clinton.
[02:55:57.009 --> 02:55:59.251]  Here it is at a Hillary book signing.
[02:55:59.251 --> 02:56:00.913]  You're not going to get away with this.
[02:56:00.913 --> 02:56:03.775]  This is Hillary Clinton signing.
[02:56:05.168 --> 02:56:06.229]  Whoa!
[02:56:06.229 --> 02:56:08.210]  Boo!
[02:56:08.210 --> 02:56:09.811]  I agree.
[02:56:09.811 --> 02:56:15.856]  We've got to cover all the flipping off because we're on a lot of TV stations now and I guess you can't FCC show them flipping everybody off.
[02:56:15.856 --> 02:56:16.697]  I didn't even know that.
[02:56:16.697 --> 02:56:18.718]  I apologize to some of the stations that called us last Friday.
[02:56:18.718 --> 02:56:21.820]  I was showing stuff of these women flipping people off and they're like, you can't show that.
[02:56:21.820 --> 02:56:24.582]  So, but, but it's only picked a few.
[02:56:24.582 --> 02:56:25.803]  They're all like this.
[02:56:25.803 --> 02:56:26.464]  What happened to them?
[02:56:28.007 --> 02:56:36.489]  Well, there are people, of course, who use false ethics to gather power, and there are other people, though, who have good intentions, who simply have the wrong information.
[02:56:36.489 --> 02:56:42.830]  So, I Twittered something this morning, which I'll mention briefly here, Alex, which is, you know, people care about poor people in the third world.
[02:56:42.830 --> 02:56:50.971]  Now, in the past, when Western companies went to the third world and scraped up a bunch of resources and took them out of the third world, people said, well, that's wretched, terrible imperialism.
[02:56:50.971 --> 02:56:52.672]  Okay, I understand that case.
[02:56:52.672 --> 02:56:53.832]  But now, in the West,
[02:56:54.512 --> 02:57:00.137]  A lot of countries in the West are scooping up the smartest people from the third world and bringing them into the West.
[02:57:00.137 --> 02:57:05.101]  Now, intelligence is one of the greatest natural resources, along with empathy, that the world has.
[02:57:05.101 --> 02:57:05.561]  Exactly.
[02:57:05.561 --> 02:57:17.831]  So how is it terrible to strip my natural resources from the third world in the past, but now taking the intelligent people, the most competent and educated people out of the third world, thus damning those countries to ever- It's a total brain drain!
[02:57:17.831 --> 02:57:18.932]  How is that not equivalent?
[02:57:18.932 --> 02:57:19.332]  Stay there.
[02:57:19.332 --> 02:57:20.733]  I want to do five more minutes because I noticed this.
[02:57:21.534 --> 02:57:25.457]  Even when I was a little kid in the country, people were smart, they were cool, they were good-looking.
[02:57:25.457 --> 02:57:34.703]  Now I go to the countryside, where a lot of my family's from, and it looks like Beverly Hillbillies, and it's just cable TV or satellite TV and people, because it's like the brain's left.
[02:57:34.703 --> 02:57:36.264]  And it's the same thing with the third world.
[02:57:36.264 --> 02:57:37.805]  It just wipes it out.
[02:57:37.805 --> 02:57:38.586]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:38.586 --> 02:57:39.947]  That's a key point he just made.
[02:57:46.906 --> 02:57:51.594]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:57:51.594 --> 02:57:53.077]  Op-op-op-optimum levels.
[02:57:54.161 --> 02:57:58.805]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[02:57:58.805 --> 02:58:01.128]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:58:01.128 --> 02:58:02.909]  B vitamins we need every day.
[02:58:02.909 --> 02:58:08.194]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[02:58:08.194 --> 02:58:10.476]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[02:58:10.476 --> 02:58:16.182]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[02:58:16.182 --> 02:58:16.562]  Secret 12.
[02:58:16.562 --> 02:58:17.443]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:58:17.603 --> 02:58:18.103]  We're good.
[02:58:44.562 --> 02:58:48.503]  Enjoy all natural bath and beauty products with Emmerich's Essentials.

[03:00:01.812 --> 03:00:05.053]  Hour number four.
[03:00:05.053 --> 03:00:09.455]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:00:09.455 --> 03:00:11.916]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:11.916 --> 03:00:13.137]  And Stefan Molyneux.
[03:00:13.137 --> 03:00:26.502]  I'm going to host a little bit in the next hour, Matt Dubigal of our wonderful 1530 WCKG affiliate that also has an FM station, but very soon it's going to be covering the entire city from a very powerful position on top of a very important building.
[03:00:26.502 --> 03:00:27.802]  We'll be able to announce that in the next month.
[03:00:27.802 --> 03:00:29.903]  Stefan Molyneux made a really good point.
[03:00:29.903 --> 03:00:31.324]  I was thinking about this this morning.
[03:00:33.436 --> 03:00:48.616]  What made the Western expansion across the United States so important was you had dozens of different factions, just in the tribes alone, but you had the Spanish, you had the Russians, you had the British, you had the French, and you had all these other groups coming in to the wild, wild West that was 95% empty.
[03:00:49.898 --> 03:00:53.721]  Yeah, the tribes jockeying to get different Westerners to fight on their side.
[03:00:53.721 --> 03:01:04.188]  It was barbarous, but it was also empowering for humans, and that's why all the invention and things came out of it, because we're meant to be trailblazing, we're meant to be pushed.
[03:01:04.188 --> 03:01:10.393]  And you read the annals of the people on wagon trains and all of it, even though they had kids dying and everything, it was invigorating, it was real.
[03:01:11.383 --> 03:01:16.404]  You walk around in a rich neighborhood, you walk around in a poor neighborhood, people are like zombies on their smartphones.
[03:01:16.404 --> 03:01:18.725]  They look unconscious, they look ugly.
[03:01:18.725 --> 03:01:23.646]  Even if a woman looks like she once had attractive features, they look like zombies.
[03:01:23.646 --> 03:01:26.807]  It's the television, it's the culture, it's the sedentary lifestyle.
[03:01:26.807 --> 03:01:27.927]  It's all of it.
[03:01:27.927 --> 03:01:30.788]  And then you look at the brain drain out of the countryside in America.
[03:01:31.733 --> 03:01:35.698]  And you know, I don't care if it's black people, white people, they all look different.
[03:01:35.698 --> 03:01:37.881]  They look like they have their souls sucked out.
[03:01:37.881 --> 03:01:40.884]  Unless there's still some of the people still working on the land doing it.
[03:01:40.884 --> 03:01:45.670]  A lot of them are just kind of on welfare, doing little jobs, living in trailers, watching TV all day.
[03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:46.611]  They don't have a purpose!
[03:01:47.412 --> 03:01:57.077]  And then you see the attack on the ethos, the attack on the West, the attack on that because it was a consciousness, it was a culture, and instead they've given us this!
[03:01:57.077 --> 03:01:57.997]  It's total death!
[03:01:57.997 --> 03:02:05.361]  We got three minutes left, Stefan Molyneux, but the globalist brain drain from the third world is just like from the countryside to the cities.
[03:02:06.161 --> 03:02:14.488]  And the globalists then never even put enough money into the countries like Apple to let the Chinese have a livable wage like Henry Ford so they can buy the stinking iPhone.
[03:02:14.488 --> 03:02:24.757]  But as long as they say they're liberal and virtue signal, it's okay when they're the most anti-human, cold-blooded people admitting they don't want industrialization for the Chinese, for the Africans.
[03:02:24.757 --> 03:02:26.298]  They're just scum!
[03:02:26.298 --> 03:02:27.520]  They know they're scum!
[03:02:27.520 --> 03:02:27.840]  Go ahead.
[03:02:29.252 --> 03:02:35.393]  So the most important thing I think in this area, Alex, is something called the Pareto Principle, which everyone needs to become familiar with.
[03:02:35.393 --> 03:02:37.814]  And the Pareto Principle goes something like this.
[03:02:37.814 --> 03:02:43.014]  The square root of the number of people produces half the value of that group.
[03:02:43.014 --> 03:02:46.395]  So if you've got 9 people, 3 people are producing half the value.
[03:02:46.395 --> 03:02:46.595]  Right?
[03:02:46.595 --> 03:02:52.656]  If you have 100 people, 10 people, if you have 10,000 people in a company, 100 people are producing half the value.
[03:02:52.656 --> 03:02:56.777]  Now, if you have a company where smart people start to leave for whatever reason,
[03:02:57.486 --> 03:03:03.172]  Then the smartest people leave, it means that the company productivity goes down enormously.
[03:03:03.172 --> 03:03:10.860]  If you get the top hundred people leaving, okay, you still have 9,900 workers in a 10,000 worker company, but half your productivity is gone.
[03:03:10.860 --> 03:03:13.622]  This is why people become rich and other people middle class, other people are poor.
[03:03:13.622 --> 03:03:15.304]  There's a bell curve of productivity.
[03:03:15.304 --> 03:03:16.185]  Think of the third world.
[03:03:16.957 --> 03:03:22.363]  Western civilization rests on the brains, hearts, minds, and muscle of maybe 2,000 people.
[03:03:22.363 --> 03:03:22.963]  Maybe.
[03:03:22.963 --> 03:03:24.445]  Maybe 2,000 people.
[03:03:24.445 --> 03:03:31.172]  Who innovated, who reasoned, who took risks, who scientifically, philosophically, economically moved us all forward.
[03:03:31.172 --> 03:03:35.837]  In the third world, there are a small number of people who can reform the third world and make it into a better place.
[03:03:35.837 --> 03:03:36.478]  Now, if the West
[03:03:36.858 --> 03:03:37.498]  We're good to go.
[03:04:11.472 --> 03:04:12.733]  Absolutely beautifully said.
[03:04:12.733 --> 03:04:14.054]  I could not... I mean, that's it.
[03:04:14.054 --> 03:04:15.756]  And it's designed to melt down.
[03:04:15.756 --> 03:04:19.319]  And you read the Globalist Actuaries, they know they're doing this.
[03:04:19.319 --> 03:04:24.924]  And then plan with AI and stuff to then control the implosion, which they're going to use to take over.
[03:04:24.924 --> 03:04:26.185]  This has got to be stopped.
[03:04:27.919 --> 03:04:32.541]  And the only way to stop it is to defend your own culture and reason and speak.
[03:04:32.541 --> 03:04:33.901]  And not adopt globalism.
[03:04:33.901 --> 03:04:34.861]  Reject it.
[03:04:34.861 --> 03:04:37.002]  Rejecting globalism is accepting life.
[03:04:37.002 --> 03:04:39.443]  Accepting globalism is submitting to death.
[03:04:39.443 --> 03:04:40.663]  Powerful.
[03:04:40.663 --> 03:04:41.844]  Love the new book, my friend.
[03:04:41.844 --> 03:04:43.284]  Stefan Molyneux.
[03:04:43.284 --> 03:04:47.566]  The art of the deals out there, but he's got his new book, The Art of the Argument.
[03:04:47.566 --> 03:04:48.046]  Find it.
[03:04:48.046 --> 03:04:49.926]  I thank you so much, my friend.
[03:04:49.926 --> 03:04:50.927]  Thank you.
[03:04:50.927 --> 03:04:51.367]  We'll be back.
[03:04:52.734 --> 03:05:04.191]  After years of research, working with top developers here in the United States, with the latest cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[03:05:04.191 --> 03:05:08.037]  One of them is a powerful pro-digestive enzyme, Carnivore
[03:05:08.277 --> 03:05:11.678]  For being able to break down meat and other proteins better.
[03:05:11.678 --> 03:05:22.059]  And then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic culture of the very best strains in Floralife Advanced Restoration.
[03:05:22.059 --> 03:05:27.080]  And we also have an everyday, extremely affordable, Floralife Everyday Maintenance.
[03:05:27.080 --> 03:05:36.882]  But all of these are the very cutting edge, top of the line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely high cost.
[03:05:38.022 --> 03:05:43.226]  Is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[03:05:43.226 --> 03:05:52.253]  When you purchase it at m4wrestore.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[03:05:59.391 --> 03:06:13.617]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:13.617 --> 03:06:14.317]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:06:18.516 --> 03:06:22.698]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[03:06:22.698 --> 03:06:30.963]  Matt Dubiel of 1530 WCKG in Chicago, one of our great affiliates in the country, co-host here with The Fourth Hour.
[03:06:30.963 --> 03:06:32.884]  He's about to take over.
[03:06:32.884 --> 03:06:42.770]  But I wanted to come back on the broadcast here and just introduce something here with Thanksgiving accelerating up on us so incredibly quickly.
[03:06:42.770 --> 03:06:43.591]  And it's just that
[03:06:44.790 --> 03:07:11.028]  When you study the attack on the West, and you study the attack on free market, and when you study how the globalists are engineering society, and you look at how cold-blooded it is, you have their plan.
[03:07:12.529 --> 03:07:29.418]  And they knew that America found its soul and its new ethos in the West, in the expansion, and in the swashbuckling, freebooting experiences that happened.
[03:07:29.418 --> 03:07:35.641]  A new culture came out of it, from the Native Americans, and from the Spanish, and from
[03:07:38.430 --> 03:07:45.012]  The French and the British and the Scots and the Irish and the Chinese and everything else.
[03:07:45.012 --> 03:07:51.473]  And that out of that came the most inventions, the most science, rugged people, strength.
[03:07:51.473 --> 03:07:59.155]  And America was in love with the idea of exploring and innovating and going out and taking a risk.
[03:07:59.155 --> 03:08:04.416]  The globalists want you in a nanny state, hooked into a computer, desperate and alone.
[03:08:09.912 --> 03:08:16.736]  And I know you know that, and it's in the WikiLeaks, and it's in the Facebook documents, and it's in everything they do!
[03:08:16.736 --> 03:08:21.278]  And it's, let's wake up from this nightmare!
[03:08:21.278 --> 03:08:23.720]  Let's say no to it!
[03:08:23.720 --> 03:08:25.541]  I mean, you never see on the news.
[03:08:27.199 --> 03:08:49.104]  The type of stuff that's gone on in Indonesia, or that's gone on in the Pacific Islands, or that's gone on in Africa, or that's gone on in Latin America, and the carnage, and the enslavement, and the murdering, and the killing, and the stealing, and the rich elites, that always openly say to anthropologists, of course I keep the village poor, huh?
[03:08:49.104 --> 03:08:51.165]  I keep them in their place.
[03:08:51.165 --> 03:08:56.426]  That's the feudal system that they had in Europe, that they had in China, that they've had everywhere.
[03:08:58.632 --> 03:09:03.416]  And we're trying to get out of that monopoly.
[03:09:03.416 --> 03:09:07.540]  The idea that free market's wasteful because it makes you rich, so we should get rid of it.
[03:09:07.540 --> 03:09:10.962]  Well, the Soviet Union is even more destructive, or China, or North Korea.
[03:09:10.962 --> 03:09:17.688]  We need to have good, clean living and get cleaner systems, and we've done that, and we've innovated that.
[03:09:17.688 --> 03:09:21.752]  But this guilt that they put on us
[03:09:22.901 --> 03:09:28.783]  Has been cooked up by psychological warfare experts in their own admissions to attack our culture.
[03:09:28.783 --> 03:09:38.826]  I'm not saying our culture is perfect, but they attack it because they're overriding it with something that isn't a culture.
[03:09:38.826 --> 03:09:45.989]  It's a system of guilt and fear of knowledge and fear of words and fear of communication and fear of real diversity.
[03:09:51.044 --> 03:09:57.769]  It's a prison system, turning us all into groups in our little sub-area.
[03:09:57.769 --> 03:10:01.511]  And it's the final endgame of authoritarianism.
[03:10:01.511 --> 03:10:19.023]  And the entire battle group structure of the globalists is, they are preparing the way for the new species, and cannot wait to dispatch us in an orderly way, not through war, but through chemical, biological, and electromagnetic
[03:10:20.399 --> 03:10:29.726]  Systems, they've got technology where they can hit a button and make everybody's heart stop.
[03:10:29.726 --> 03:10:37.151]  Puts out an electromagnetic wavelength pulse that makes your brain trigger death.
[03:10:37.151 --> 03:10:39.573]  It kills almost everybody.
[03:10:39.573 --> 03:10:43.056]  They've had it for 60 years.
[03:10:43.056 --> 03:10:44.677]  They've had neutron bombs for 60 years.
[03:10:46.957 --> 03:10:47.798]  That's another system.
[03:10:47.798 --> 03:10:50.740]  I mean, it's just it's unlimited, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:10:50.740 --> 03:10:52.642]  And that's the power trip.
[03:10:52.642 --> 03:10:57.306]  They used our money, our ideas, our ingenuity to build all this super science.
[03:10:57.306 --> 03:10:59.368]  And now notice they want to kind of slow technology down.
[03:10:59.368 --> 03:11:00.208]  Oh, forget it.
[03:11:00.208 --> 03:11:01.750]  That stuff's never going to come out.
[03:11:01.750 --> 03:11:04.432]  That's because they're warehousing it.
[03:11:04.432 --> 03:11:14.160]  The SR-71 Blackbird was developed in the late 1940s, and it was in service by the mid 1950s, just classified, and then wasn't unveiled later until the 60s.
[03:11:15.953 --> 03:11:21.194]  The SR-71 Blackbird admittedly can go about Mach 5, but reportedly it's a lot faster.
[03:11:21.194 --> 03:11:22.435]  It's a space plane.
[03:11:22.435 --> 03:11:25.176]  It flies up into space.
[03:11:25.176 --> 03:11:32.177]  Now, do you believe an aircraft in service in 1955 is still the fastest aircraft in the world?
[03:11:32.177 --> 03:11:33.998]  The answer is no, it's not.
[03:11:33.998 --> 03:11:36.359]  And that's just the beginning of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:11:36.359 --> 03:11:37.419]  And so the globalists
[03:11:38.953 --> 03:11:47.596]  The elite psychopaths, they are seeing all this and are testing it on us, and now really do have massive life extension.
[03:11:47.596 --> 03:11:49.396]  They've got stuff that's AI.
[03:11:49.396 --> 03:11:52.677]  It's just not self-aware, but it's artificially intelligent.
[03:11:52.677 --> 03:11:58.619]  And what we know they've got is so advanced that that's why they act like we don't even exist now.
[03:11:58.619 --> 03:12:00.160]  They've got a plan.
[03:12:00.160 --> 03:12:01.020]  They're carrying it out.
[03:12:02.489 --> 03:12:05.371]  And they don't want us to be aware of it or to have any culture.
[03:12:05.371 --> 03:12:09.893]  And people that are part of it are scared, and they're dutifully following their orders.
[03:12:09.893 --> 03:12:15.096]  You watch those Google, Facebook, and Twitter executives in those hearings attacking InfoWars.
[03:12:15.096 --> 03:12:18.718]  They were scared of Congress, and they were scared, and they were there like little scientists.
[03:12:18.718 --> 03:12:20.359]  Yes, sir, we're doing it.
[03:12:20.359 --> 03:12:21.940]  Program operational, yes.
[03:12:21.940 --> 03:12:23.420]  We're going to shut them down, don't worry.
[03:12:23.420 --> 03:12:25.842]  Because they've been dialed in, okay?
[03:12:26.542 --> 03:12:38.606]  They want themselves to be safe, that's why almost none of them have families, because they're saying no one in the EU leadership now has children, except for five countries that are pulling out of it.
[03:12:38.606 --> 03:12:40.206]  They all have kids.
[03:12:40.206 --> 03:12:51.690]  All the major elites don't have children now, ladies and gentlemen, because they've been told you may not get access into the ARC centers
[03:12:52.830 --> 03:12:56.053]  The below ground facilities in places during this, if you've got kids.
[03:12:56.053 --> 03:12:57.274]  And we don't want your kids there.
[03:12:57.274 --> 03:12:57.795]  We understand.
[03:12:57.795 --> 03:12:59.056]  I mean, we're close, folks.
[03:12:59.056 --> 03:13:00.297]  None of them are having kids.
[03:13:00.297 --> 03:13:03.019]  Because they wouldn't put kids through what's about to happen.
[03:13:03.019 --> 03:13:04.160]  I'm having more.
[03:13:04.160 --> 03:13:05.241]  I'm taking everything.
[03:13:05.241 --> 03:13:07.083]  I'm putting everything I got on the table.
[03:13:07.083 --> 03:13:08.644]  I'm going to have more children.
[03:13:08.644 --> 03:13:09.185]  We're going into this.
[03:13:09.185 --> 03:13:09.866]  We're going to win.
[03:13:09.866 --> 03:13:11.007]  I'm putting everything on the line.
[03:13:11.007 --> 03:13:11.807]  I'm not a coward.
[03:13:11.807 --> 03:13:12.348]  I'm having more.
[03:13:13.717 --> 03:13:25.103]  And I love them more than my life a thousand times, and that's why I love them enough to put them on the table so they have a future, and I'm not gonna give up on humanity just because these sick psychopaths have decided to bring in world government and kill everybody.
[03:13:25.103 --> 03:13:36.410]  Because let me tell you something, the words out on what you've done, I don't care how much AI you've got, how many droid armies you've got, how many drone air forces you've got, they got 20,000 predator drones, folks.
[03:13:36.410 --> 03:13:38.511]  That's not for foreign governments, that's for us.
[03:13:38.511 --> 03:13:40.192]  That's for our military to take them out.
[03:13:41.601 --> 03:13:52.771]  I said this 20 years ago reading DARPA documents, and then two Terminators ago, you learn it's a crazy woman who uploaded her brain into Skynet, and it's what nuked everything and took over.
[03:13:52.771 --> 03:13:55.113]  And they're just telling you what they're doing.
[03:13:55.113 --> 03:14:01.639]  They're crazy people that want to upload themselves into machines, they believe they're God, and they want to kill the Scourges on the planet first.
[03:14:02.722 --> 03:14:08.548]  Because they're projecting their hatred of themselves onto us, and they really believe they're going to get away with this.
[03:14:08.548 --> 03:14:16.655]  And I'm here to tell them, you're not going to get away with your plan, your self-driving cars, all your crud you're bringing out.
[03:14:16.655 --> 03:14:24.623]  You're going to get away with a lot of it, but down the road, even if you're successful in the first 95% of your operation, you're going to be dug out of those holes.
[03:14:28.038 --> 03:14:30.119]  And you're going to be begging to get out of those holes.
[03:14:30.119 --> 03:14:44.107]  Do you people think your instinct to kill everybody, and your instinct to stab people in the back, and your instinct to hate humanity, is going to stop when you're all put yourselves in hell, under the ground, gone into rat holes yourself, so you can try to wipe everybody out?
[03:14:44.107 --> 03:14:45.448]  Good luck, scum!
[03:14:45.448 --> 03:14:46.809]  Good luck!
[03:14:46.809 --> 03:14:50.651]  I'm telling you right now, your New World Order's dead!
[03:14:50.651 --> 03:14:52.192]  Your EU's dead!
[03:14:52.192 --> 03:14:53.732]  Your whole project's dead!
[03:14:53.732 --> 03:14:54.273]  Here's the problem.
[03:14:55.163 --> 03:15:01.184]  All the AI, all the corruption, even though your system's being betrayed, you were just building it.
[03:15:01.184 --> 03:15:04.345]  There's gonna be bigger wars, and there's gonna be all sorts of problems.
[03:15:04.345 --> 03:15:08.786]  If we try to not destroy ourselves, we still might.
[03:15:08.786 --> 03:15:17.048]  And so we're entering an incredible time to be alive, and we need people to be informed, and know what's going on, and understand that you can get next year's news today.
[03:15:17.048 --> 03:15:20.968]  Not because we're rocket scientists, because we're following their operations!
[03:15:20.968 --> 03:15:23.869]  They operate out in the open like you're an idiot!
[03:15:24.932 --> 03:15:30.557]  We're here simply telling you what their plan is and pointing out they've gotten a lot of this stuff done before.
[03:15:30.557 --> 03:15:32.138]  You better take them serious.
[03:15:32.138 --> 03:15:35.682]  These are homicidal, psychopathic killers.
[03:15:35.682 --> 03:15:36.342]  So remember this.
[03:15:36.342 --> 03:15:36.883]  Thanks, Kevin.
[03:15:36.883 --> 03:15:43.148]  All the attacks on the West is because the West isn't out to totally murder you and wants prosperity in an idea.
[03:15:43.148 --> 03:15:44.690]  And they want to kill that idea.
[03:15:44.690 --> 03:15:46.351]  Matt Dubio takes over.
[03:15:46.351 --> 03:15:46.972]  Straight ahead.

[03:20:43.800 --> 03:20:53.249]  I was just listening myself to Alex talking with Stefan Molyneux and I want to talk about some of the things that Stefan was bringing up with Alex and but before we do
[03:20:54.009 --> 03:20:56.232]  Like I do every time I step in.
[03:20:56.232 --> 03:20:57.953]  I want to say thanks to the folks at InfoWars.
[03:20:57.953 --> 03:21:03.038]  Thanks to Alex for letting me pop in and bring attention to Chicago.
[03:21:03.038 --> 03:21:07.943]  You're not going to hear on the news that the death toll for November is 24 in the month of November.
[03:21:10.385 --> 03:21:16.329]  November, 24 people dead in Chicago, most of them due to gun violence.
[03:21:16.329 --> 03:21:21.893]  I'm not a proponent of banning or blocking or inhibiting our Second Amendment rights.
[03:21:21.893 --> 03:21:30.118]  In fact, I believe the solution to that problem, the problem in Chicago, that it's Las Vegas every month in slow motion.
[03:21:30.999 --> 03:21:34.920]  Las Vegas every month in slow motion in Chicago.
[03:21:34.920 --> 03:21:37.341]  And why is this important to you if you're not in Chicago?
[03:21:37.341 --> 03:21:38.161]  Why do you care?
[03:21:38.161 --> 03:21:45.084]  Why do you give a crap if you're not in Chicago, if you're not in Detroit, if you're not in Missouri, another terrible St.
[03:21:45.084 --> 03:21:48.225]  Louis, another terrible crime-ridden city.
[03:21:48.225 --> 03:21:51.306]  A beautiful city, but terribly crime-ridden.
[03:21:51.306 --> 03:21:57.088]  It's got a crime problem, it's got a murder problem, it's got an illegal gun problem, it's got a gangbanger problem, it's got a drug problem.
[03:21:58.024 --> 03:21:59.825]  Why do you care if you're in Omaha?
[03:21:59.825 --> 03:22:01.485]  Why do you care if you're in the South?
[03:22:01.485 --> 03:22:03.566]  Why do you care if you're not in a big city?
[03:22:03.566 --> 03:22:05.746]  Because it's coming to a theater near you.
[03:22:05.746 --> 03:22:09.307]  And I don't mean via the movies, I mean via real life.
[03:22:09.307 --> 03:22:21.691]  So, what you see happening in Detroit, what you see happening in Chicago, what you see happening in New York, just like what you see happening on Twitter sometimes, and what you see happening on Facebook sometimes, is a sneak preview.
[03:22:21.691 --> 03:22:23.451]  How will the people react?
[03:22:23.451 --> 03:22:24.731]  How will the plebs react?
[03:22:24.731 --> 03:22:26.052]  What will happen when this happens?
[03:22:27.014 --> 03:22:29.576]  So you can lay down and take it, or you can take action.
[03:22:29.576 --> 03:22:36.701]  24 people dead in November, for the month of November, 24.
[03:22:36.701 --> 03:22:44.127]  For the year 2017, we're at 616 dead.
[03:22:44.127 --> 03:22:55.495]  Now, I don't know what the total is, maybe somebody can do the math, since Rahm Emanuel took office in 2011, but more people, I believe, have died in Chicago than have died in some wars
[03:22:56.636 --> 03:22:57.677]  It's our home turf here.
[03:22:57.677 --> 03:23:04.002]  So I like to bring attention to that every time I'm on because, as I said, it's coming to a theater near you.
[03:23:04.002 --> 03:23:04.983]  It's coming.
[03:23:04.983 --> 03:23:08.446]  It's Las Vegas every month in slow motion here in Chicago.
[03:23:08.446 --> 03:23:23.679]  And if it's allowed to happen in Vegas, if it's allowed to happen in Chicago, it's going to be allowed to happen in your town, USA, even though your police are being militarized, even though your local police department may have a really shiny, cool tank and lots of
[03:23:24.620 --> 03:23:27.907]  Combat gear for the police while they're being underwritten by the Feds?
[03:23:29.144 --> 03:23:34.145]  My name is Matt, and I'm not necessarily going to keep having kids, although I'd love to.
[03:23:34.145 --> 03:23:36.386]  I have four kids myself.
[03:23:36.386 --> 03:23:40.706]  Alex, if you just missed it in the last break, he was talking about having more kids.
[03:23:40.706 --> 03:23:44.427]  And probably a lot of us Americans need to be doing that.
[03:23:44.427 --> 03:23:49.968]  The other side, the other people are, some of them, breeding like crazy.
[03:23:49.968 --> 03:23:56.490]  And over time, there's some polls that will show you that radical Islamists are going to be outbreeding
[03:23:57.150 --> 03:24:03.622]  Christian conservative Americans and just level-headed people in general over the course of the next 10, 20, and 30 years and beyond.
[03:24:05.717 --> 03:24:15.826]  Whether you're going to be having more kids or no kids, many of us in the United States, hopefully you, with people you love, are going to be celebrating Thanksgiving.
[03:24:15.826 --> 03:24:18.528]  It's a holiday that is one of my favorites.
[03:24:18.528 --> 03:24:19.890]  We celebrate it in my home.
[03:24:19.890 --> 03:24:22.111]  We have about 40 people over.
[03:24:22.111 --> 03:24:25.374]  People I love more than anything.
[03:24:25.374 --> 03:24:26.155]  It's a good time.
[03:24:26.155 --> 03:24:31.219]  It's a great time to reflect not only on the things that we have to be thankful for as Americans,
[03:24:32.469 --> 03:24:39.975]  But the things we have to be thankful for as human beings, you know, some of us practice being grateful on a daily basis.
[03:24:39.975 --> 03:24:41.456]  Some of us forget.
[03:24:41.456 --> 03:24:42.797]  Some of us do it in our prayers.
[03:24:42.797 --> 03:24:46.100]  Some of us do it when we wake up in the morning and when we go to bed at night.
[03:24:46.100 --> 03:24:50.843]  Thank God for, you know, our heart beating and our lungs breathing and our brain working.
[03:24:50.843 --> 03:24:56.728]  Those sort of simple things, the things that we're able to enjoy, our ability to walk,
[03:24:57.972 --> 03:25:12.395]  If you're a woman, the ability to speak, to not have to be covered up in a sweaty garment as a law, to be able to walk freely, to be able to drive like everybody else.
[03:25:12.395 --> 03:25:19.536]  Some of these things we all take for granted and it's human nature because you just get into everyday life and you just take it for granted.
[03:25:19.536 --> 03:25:21.176]  Well, I can drive.
[03:25:21.176 --> 03:25:25.417]  I'm really grateful to the guy and people that invented the automobile.
[03:25:26.471 --> 03:25:29.172]  I don't have to take a horse and buggy to wherever I'm going.
[03:25:29.172 --> 03:25:32.852]  I don't have to churn the butter in order for us to eat.
[03:25:32.852 --> 03:25:34.073]  Thank you.
[03:25:34.073 --> 03:25:35.453]  It's great to be thankful.
[03:25:35.453 --> 03:25:37.053]  It's great to be grateful.
[03:25:37.053 --> 03:25:41.474]  And there are studies out there that show the more grateful you are, the more thankful you are.
[03:25:41.474 --> 03:25:45.655]  The better you feel, the better the life around you is.
[03:25:45.655 --> 03:25:47.476]  The better things happen to you.
[03:25:48.516 --> 03:25:50.977]  Some people might say it's part of the simulation.
[03:25:50.977 --> 03:25:54.339]  It's part of the code in the simulation that we're experiencing.
[03:25:54.339 --> 03:25:58.782]  Others will say that that's just the way it is and that's the way God works.
[03:25:58.782 --> 03:26:09.568]  Either way, no matter what you believe, no matter who you pray to, no matter what you celebrate, if you're an American and you're celebrating Thanksgiving, you're likely going to be getting together with many family members.
[03:26:09.568 --> 03:26:11.729]  Many, many family members.
[03:26:11.729 --> 03:26:13.130]  Not all of them are going to agree with you.
[03:26:14.400 --> 03:26:17.461]  Not all of them see things the way that you see things.
[03:26:17.461 --> 03:26:19.221]  And how do you deal with that?
[03:26:19.221 --> 03:26:30.343]  How do you handle the Thanksgiving festivities when you know that that one cousin, or that one aunt, or that one uncle, or maybe you're the one cousin, and you're the one aunt, or you're the one uncle.
[03:26:30.343 --> 03:26:40.405]  How do you red pill the people you love the most, the people that you want to be on your side the most, the people that you have the best chance of getting in the foxhole next to you?
[03:26:41.605 --> 03:26:52.978]  If the fit hits the shan like it could and like it probably will one day when it's going to be very important to be around people that are like-minded on the same team.
[03:26:52.978 --> 03:26:55.741]  How do you red pill those people so that
[03:26:56.823 --> 03:27:01.106]  You have a network that you can count on.
[03:27:01.106 --> 03:27:03.588]  How do you do it without ruining the holiday?
[03:27:03.588 --> 03:27:05.950]  How do you do it without getting the frying pan?
[03:27:05.950 --> 03:27:12.114]  How do you do it so that you're not sitting in one room and everyone else is sitting in another and everyone's going, well, we're not going there again.
[03:27:12.114 --> 03:27:17.478]  We're not going to so-and-so's house for Thanksgiving or we're not inviting so-and-so to Thanksgiving.
[03:27:17.478 --> 03:27:19.620]  I'm going to... I can't tell you what to do.
[03:27:20.632 --> 03:27:26.876]  I can only share with you what I do, and I do this every year when I host Thanksgiving.
[03:27:26.876 --> 03:27:37.824]  I'm going to give you the things that I do in order to red pill my family without coming off as a douche, without everybody leaving going, oh man, we're not going back there.
[03:27:37.824 --> 03:27:44.408]  Some of you might think it's oversimplified, but I'm going to tell you it works like a charm.
[03:27:44.408 --> 03:27:45.549]  It works for my kids.
[03:27:45.549 --> 03:27:46.529]  It works for my family.
[03:27:46.529 --> 03:27:47.890]  We all have a great time.
[03:27:47.890 --> 03:27:50.152]  We are celebrating.
[03:27:50.852 --> 03:27:52.692]  We're celebrating the gift of being an American.
[03:27:52.692 --> 03:27:58.153]  We're celebrating the gift of being thankful for being free.
[03:27:58.153 --> 03:27:59.154]  We have a Bill of Rights.
[03:27:59.154 --> 03:28:00.634]  We have a Constitution.
[03:28:00.634 --> 03:28:04.155]  And every year, everybody leaves happy.
[03:28:04.155 --> 03:28:07.515]  Happy, happy, happy, as the Duck Commander guy would say.
[03:28:07.515 --> 03:28:09.796]  So we're going to talk about that coming up in the next segment.
[03:28:09.796 --> 03:28:13.216]  We're also going to talk a little bit about this video I saw.
[03:28:13.216 --> 03:28:15.737]  I saw an InfoWars reporter, Millie Weaver.
[03:28:16.849 --> 03:28:17.690]  In the trenches!
[03:28:17.690 --> 03:28:32.271]  Uh, boy, she's got some guts, and the way she handled herself was pretty phenomenal, and the amount of hate and vitriol, and it was so disgusting to me to see how people treated her.
[03:28:33.112 --> 03:28:38.634]  But I was grateful and thankful for the way that she behaved and how she handled herself.
[03:28:38.634 --> 03:28:39.715]  I want to point some of that out.
[03:28:39.715 --> 03:28:45.537]  I'll also point out some of the things I noticed about our president's press conference last week.
[03:28:45.537 --> 03:28:50.439]  His little bottle of water gaffe that everybody says is a gaffe.
[03:28:50.439 --> 03:28:51.540]  I see it a little bit differently.
[03:28:51.940 --> 03:28:54.982]  A commemorative President Trump Dollar for only $5?
[03:28:54.982 --> 03:28:59.065]  Yes, the historic Trump Dollar starts at only $5 at TrumpDollar.us.

[03:29:52.921 --> 03:30:01.166]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[03:30:01.166 --> 03:30:02.387]  A 360 win.
[03:30:02.387 --> 03:30:08.631]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[03:30:08.951 --> 03:30:16.875]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[03:30:16.875 --> 03:30:21.958]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:30:21.958 --> 03:30:28.061]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[03:30:28.061 --> 03:30:29.182]  Just go to InfoWareStore.com.
[03:30:29.682 --> 03:30:31.663]  Select your favorite product or products.
[03:30:31.663 --> 03:30:35.845]  Click on AutoShip and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:30:35.845 --> 03:30:38.207]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win.
[03:30:38.207 --> 03:30:42.369]  And with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[03:30:42.369 --> 03:30:44.030]  10% off on AutoShip.
[03:30:44.030 --> 03:30:46.451]  Win, win, win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:30:46.451 --> 03:30:48.432]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[03:30:48.432 --> 03:30:52.274]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[03:30:58.103 --> 03:31:03.105]  Keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:31:03.105 --> 03:31:11.869]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[03:31:11.869 --> 03:31:19.453]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[03:31:19.453 --> 03:31:24.515]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[03:31:26.556 --> 03:31:27.056]  We're good.
[03:31:53.234 --> 03:32:03.120]  I point out a lot to our listeners and viewers that without you funding our operation by purchasing products in fullworcetour.com, we would not be here.
[03:32:03.120 --> 03:32:04.381]  We don't have corporate sponsors.
[03:32:04.381 --> 03:32:05.842]  We don't have globalist funding.
[03:32:05.842 --> 03:32:08.083]  We're funded by patriots like you.
[03:32:08.083 --> 03:32:21.912]  And we also, of course, provide high quality products to make it easy to support yourself and to support us symbiotically as we try to retake this country and the planet and heal the population that's been under globalist engineering.
[03:32:22.552 --> 03:32:27.974]  That said, we're running biggest specials ever every single year during Black Friday.
[03:32:27.974 --> 03:32:30.374]  And this year is even better than last year.
[03:32:30.374 --> 03:32:33.375]  We've got free shipping store-wide on everything.

[03:32:45.098 --> 03:32:46.619]  That's unprecedented.

[03:32:55.439 --> 03:33:13.812]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.812 --> 03:33:18.355]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:33:18.355 --> 03:33:21.717]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:21.717 --> 03:33:22.378]  Well, sort of.
[03:33:24.277 --> 03:33:28.580]  I'm defending and doing that stuff on behalf of Alex Jones for the fourth hour.
[03:33:28.580 --> 03:33:36.626]  My name is Matt Dubiel and I'm the Big Mouth here at WCKG in Chicago, AM 1530, FM 102.3.
[03:33:36.626 --> 03:33:39.588]  Today I am personally powered by Brain Force.
[03:33:39.588 --> 03:33:51.657]  If you want to try something that is a little better than coffee, a little bit better than shoving energy drinks down your pipe, I can say that I've been taking Brain Force for about a month now and it's working!
[03:33:52.037 --> 03:33:58.141]  It is working, and it doesn't give you that energy drink buzz with the 2 o'clock crash.
[03:33:58.141 --> 03:34:08.008]  The good news is, is if you go to InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com right now, for a limited time only, there's a holiday special.
[03:34:08.008 --> 03:34:11.330]  50% off Brain Force Plus.

[03:34:13.431 --> 03:34:14.092]  Get it now.
[03:34:14.092 --> 03:34:14.532]  Try it.
[03:34:14.532 --> 03:34:15.213]  You'll thank me.
[03:34:15.213 --> 03:34:17.254]  You'll thank those people over there.
[03:34:17.254 --> 03:34:18.935]  All right, so Thanksgiving is coming up.
[03:34:18.935 --> 03:34:20.696]  Thursday is Thanksgiving at my house.
[03:34:20.696 --> 03:34:21.577]  We have everyone over.
[03:34:22.557 --> 03:34:34.640]  My role at Thanksgiving is we cook three turkeys and one of them we deep fry and the other two we cook traditionally and the family comes over and it's one of the greatest days of the year.
[03:34:34.640 --> 03:34:38.421]  It's one of the things I look forward to all year because I love my family.
[03:34:38.421 --> 03:34:39.381]  We have a big family.
[03:34:39.381 --> 03:34:40.162]  My kids are there.
[03:34:40.162 --> 03:34:43.962]  I get to show them what family is all about.
[03:34:43.962 --> 03:34:45.663]  A lot of times you and I
[03:34:46.303 --> 03:34:47.564]  We tell people.
[03:34:47.564 --> 03:34:49.565]  We tell people they should watch this movie.
[03:34:49.565 --> 03:34:51.787]  We tell people they should watch this video.
[03:34:51.787 --> 03:34:58.212]  We tell people listen to Alex or listen to this guy, listen to Stefan Molyneux, follow so-and-so.
[03:34:58.212 --> 03:35:01.834]  We tell, tell, tell, tell.
[03:35:01.834 --> 03:35:09.680]  And if you're a father, if you've had a father, what you'll notice is your father shows you
[03:35:11.021 --> 03:35:13.882]  He tells you, but he also shows you.
[03:35:13.882 --> 03:35:20.143]  And as children that have been brought up by fathers, what we end up doing is we end up doing what our father showed us.
[03:35:20.143 --> 03:35:25.804]  Sometimes we don't do what he told us to do, but we almost always do what he showed us to do.
[03:35:25.804 --> 03:35:33.526]  So I told you that I would share with you the way to red pill your entire family at Thanksgiving.
[03:35:33.526 --> 03:35:38.947]  This is a foolproof way for you to red pill your entire family to the virtues
[03:35:40.107 --> 03:35:48.659]  Of doing the right thing to the virtues of maybe even being conservative and having the right ideals without alienating your family.
[03:35:48.659 --> 03:35:54.526]  Without having them think that you're just an a-hole and without ruining the holiday.
[03:35:54.526 --> 03:35:55.327]  Here's how you do it.
[03:35:55.968 --> 03:35:59.471]  Now, and think, imagine, you know, fast forward to Thursday.
[03:35:59.471 --> 03:36:01.452]  Maybe you're going to have football on.
[03:36:01.452 --> 03:36:06.475]  And inevitably, the conversation is going to come up between family members about football.
[03:36:06.475 --> 03:36:09.478]  Like, ah, what do you think about, you know, the football players?
[03:36:09.478 --> 03:36:10.859]  And what do you think about the standing?
[03:36:10.859 --> 03:36:12.220]  And what do you think about the kneeling?
[03:36:12.220 --> 03:36:15.662]  And it's a trap.
[03:36:15.662 --> 03:36:17.283]  It's a trap.
[03:36:17.283 --> 03:36:22.267]  Because no matter what you think, and no matter what Uncle So-and-so thinks,
[03:36:23.260 --> 03:36:30.383]  What you both know is you love each other and it's going to be a good day if you can find some common ground and love each other.
[03:36:30.383 --> 03:36:38.667]  Now I'm not suggesting that you roll over and say that maybe something should happen that you don't believe in.
[03:36:38.667 --> 03:36:42.808]  I'm not suggesting that you advocate for the NFL players if you don't believe in it.
[03:36:42.808 --> 03:36:47.210]  What I'm suggesting is that maybe you show and not tell.
[03:36:47.210 --> 03:36:50.312]  And I'm going to explain exactly what I mean and I'm going to share with you
[03:36:51.172 --> 03:36:58.621]  And this may seem a little corny, but I'm going to share with you a poem that my dad shared with me and that I've shared with my children.
[03:36:58.621 --> 03:37:04.268]  And I think that as I share this poem with you, it's called If, and you can find it online.
[03:37:04.268 --> 03:37:05.970]  It's very old.
[03:37:05.970 --> 03:37:08.173]  It's by Rudyard Kipling.
[03:37:08.173 --> 03:37:10.376]  Rudyard Kipling wrote this poem, If, okay?
[03:37:11.420 --> 03:37:23.625]  And as I tell you about it, as I share it with you, I think you're going to realize that it very much describes our current president, at least as he's showing himself to us right now.
[03:37:23.625 --> 03:37:26.846]  And it definitely describes the way that I was brought up.
[03:37:26.846 --> 03:37:31.848]  And it describes to my children the way that we intend on living our lives.
[03:37:31.848 --> 03:37:37.150]  And I'm just going to start it out, because the synopsis of it is, if you can keep your head
[03:37:38.050 --> 03:37:42.561]  When all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.
[03:37:42.561 --> 03:37:44.866]  If you can keep your head when all about you...
[03:37:45.845 --> 03:37:48.708]  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you.
[03:37:48.708 --> 03:37:58.957]  Now imagine, play through the last couple of years and the presidential race, the primary, the current state of politics, as I read and I share this poem with you.
[03:37:58.957 --> 03:38:03.681]  Imagine how you're going to display to your family, how you're going to show, not tell.
[03:38:03.681 --> 03:38:08.786]  You're not going to tell everybody about your politics, you're just going to show them about your values.
[03:38:08.786 --> 03:38:10.147]  It goes like this, this is called If.
[03:38:11.661 --> 03:38:17.363]  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too.
[03:38:17.363 --> 03:38:30.948]  If you can wait, not being tired by waiting, or being lied about, don't deal in lies, or being hated, don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good, nor walk too wise.
[03:38:30.948 --> 03:38:34.209]  If you can dream, and not make dreams your master,
[03:38:35.259 --> 03:38:38.641]  If you can think, and not make thoughts your aim.
[03:38:38.641 --> 03:38:45.705]  If you can meet with triumph and disaster, and treat those two imposters just the same.
[03:38:45.705 --> 03:38:59.853]  If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken, twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, or watch the things you gave your life to broken, and stoop, and build them up with worn out tools.
[03:39:01.291 --> 03:39:03.253]  I'm getting chills when I read this.
[03:39:03.253 --> 03:39:04.935]  I get chills when I give it.
[03:39:04.935 --> 03:39:07.338]  I get chills when I read it to my kids.
[03:39:07.338 --> 03:39:22.015]  If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it all on one turn of pitch and toss and lose and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss,
[03:39:23.672 --> 03:39:36.835]  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they are gone, and so hold on when there is nothing in you except the will which says to them, hold on.
[03:39:36.835 --> 03:39:44.276]  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch.
[03:39:44.276 --> 03:39:45.356]  Think about that.
[03:39:45.356 --> 03:39:47.296]  Think about it.
[03:39:47.296 --> 03:39:49.657]  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
[03:39:50.791 --> 03:39:55.614]  If all men count with you, but none too much.
[03:39:55.614 --> 03:40:05.800]  If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run, yours is the earth and everything that's in it.
[03:40:05.800 --> 03:40:12.724]  And which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
[03:40:12.724 --> 03:40:13.884]  Read that.
[03:40:13.884 --> 03:40:16.026]  Read that to your family.
[03:40:16.026 --> 03:40:17.667]  Dads, sons,
[03:40:18.755 --> 03:40:20.116]  Read that.
[03:40:20.116 --> 03:40:21.676]  It applies to women.
[03:40:21.676 --> 03:40:23.257]  Put a woe in front of the man.
[03:40:23.257 --> 03:40:24.958]  It applies to women.
[03:40:24.958 --> 03:40:27.459]  It's all about being who you are.
[03:40:27.459 --> 03:40:30.720]  It's all about fighting through adversity.
[03:40:30.720 --> 03:40:39.384]  Read it again and spend some time with it and look at it and think about the course of events over the last 12 months.
[03:40:40.643 --> 03:40:42.344]  The previous twelve months?
[03:40:42.344 --> 03:40:45.525]  Think about the things that we've been through as Americans.
[03:40:45.525 --> 03:40:50.507]  Think about the things our president has been through as a candidate.
[03:40:50.507 --> 03:40:54.528]  Think about the things he pushed through as a candidate.
[03:40:54.528 --> 03:40:56.729]  Think about the barbs and attacks.
[03:40:56.729 --> 03:41:00.791]  Think about the things that he said and how they were twisted around.
[03:41:00.791 --> 03:41:04.492]  And then read the passages from this poem.
[03:41:06.912 --> 03:41:08.933]  He's lived it in front of us.
[03:41:08.933 --> 03:41:13.854]  Now, I'm not suggesting you be a fanboy for Trump and be his apologist.
[03:41:13.854 --> 03:41:30.139]  I'm not suggesting that you stand in front of your family and tell them how great the president is, if they believe that other people, what other people are saying, if they're indoctrinated by the CNNs and the MSNBCs and the ESPNs and the New York Times and pretty much all the media.
[03:41:30.139 --> 03:41:32.700]  All I'm suggesting to you
[03:41:34.013 --> 03:41:40.260]  is on Thanksgiving, just to be that man or woman that you're here to be.
[03:41:40.260 --> 03:41:42.122]  Don't talk about any of that stuff.
[03:41:42.122 --> 03:41:43.944]  Show, don't tell.
[03:41:43.944 --> 03:41:45.767]  Show how you love everyone.
[03:41:45.767 --> 03:41:48.109]  Show that your table is made for everyone.
[03:41:48.109 --> 03:41:52.614]  Show that you have more in common than you do that separates you.
[03:41:52.614 --> 03:41:53.435]  And over time,
[03:41:54.648 --> 03:41:58.710]  Eventually somebody will ask you what your thoughts are on a certain issue.
[03:41:58.710 --> 03:42:00.571]  How do you feel about this issue?
[03:42:00.571 --> 03:42:02.332]  How do you feel about that issue?
[03:42:02.332 --> 03:42:05.733]  How do you feel about President Trump or Candidate Trump?
[03:42:05.733 --> 03:42:15.178]  And when they see that you've behaved as a man consistently, when they see that you have shown and not told, you'll find they're going to listen to you.
[03:42:16.618 --> 03:42:18.239]  And they'll listen well.
[03:42:18.239 --> 03:42:30.123]  And you'll find that you'll have a better chance of maybe not red-pilling everybody, but certainly red-pilling your immediate family, your kids, your nieces, your nephews, the ones closest to you.
[03:42:30.123 --> 03:42:33.744]  They'll look at you like you have your act together, because you do.
[03:42:33.744 --> 03:42:36.245]  Coming up, I want to talk about this Millie Weaver video.
[03:42:37.325 --> 03:42:39.146]  Millie was in the trenches!
[03:42:39.146 --> 03:42:41.747]  And boy, my hat is literally off to Millie.
[03:42:41.747 --> 03:42:46.908]  I also want to talk about our president drinking the Fiji water and why I think that was masterful.
[03:42:46.908 --> 03:42:49.149]  It's Matt Dubiel filling in for Alex Jones.
[03:42:49.149 --> 03:42:50.410]  Read that poem if.
[03:42:50.410 --> 03:42:51.190]  Share it with your family.
[03:42:51.877 --> 03:42:58.140]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.
[03:42:58.140 --> 03:43:02.502]  This powerful combo is perfect for supporting your thyroid and health.
[03:43:02.502 --> 03:43:07.884]  BioTrue Selenium's formula is far from synthetic and is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.

[03:43:18.407 --> 03:43:26.189]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[03:43:26.189 --> 03:43:33.091]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[03:43:33.471 --> 03:43:39.699]  Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.
[03:43:39.699 --> 03:43:43.524]  Take control of your chemistry today with this super combo.

[03:43:52.145 --> 03:43:55.287]  America is an information-based civil war.
[03:43:55.287 --> 03:44:02.713]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[03:44:02.713 --> 03:44:08.277]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[03:44:09.077 --> 03:44:16.745]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[03:44:16.745 --> 03:44:25.354]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[03:44:25.354 --> 03:44:30.419]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[03:44:30.419 --> 03:44:31.921]  They are the anti-liberals.
[03:44:32.501 --> 03:44:38.044]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[03:45:01.067 --> 03:45:11.895]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from infowarsstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:45:11.895 --> 03:45:14.016]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:45:14.016 --> 03:45:17.739]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarsstore.com.
[03:45:17.739 --> 03:45:19.220]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but
[03:45:19.460 --> 03:45:27.646]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[03:45:27.646 --> 03:45:30.287]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[03:45:30.287 --> 03:45:33.089]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[03:45:33.089 --> 03:45:35.571]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:45:35.571 --> 03:45:44.777]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[03:45:44.777 --> 03:45:49.200]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[03:45:52.001 --> 03:45:59.485]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[03:45:59.485 --> 03:46:12.693]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[03:46:25.520 --> 03:46:31.482]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[03:46:32.242 --> 03:46:41.270]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[03:46:41.270 --> 03:46:55.363]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[03:46:55.363 --> 03:46:58.005]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.264 --> 03:47:18.939]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:23.888 --> 03:47:25.189]  You look a little different.
[03:47:25.189 --> 03:47:27.872]  It's Matt Dubio filling in for Alex Jones.
[03:47:27.872 --> 03:47:39.182]  I am the big mouth here at WCKG in Chicago and I'm delighted and thrilled to be sitting in for the fourth hour at InfoWars.com slash show.
[03:47:39.182 --> 03:47:42.165]  InfoWars.com slash show.
[03:47:42.165 --> 03:47:46.009]  I can't recommend strongly enough to you to go to...
[03:47:47.450 --> 03:47:55.094]  InfoWarsStore or InfoWarsLife.com and get yourself Brain Force 50% off holiday special.
[03:47:55.094 --> 03:48:05.979]  It's my understanding that there is a fantabulous 34 plus, maybe at least 34 hour super broadcast coming up on Monday, Cyber Monday.
[03:48:05.979 --> 03:48:08.620]  If I read the Twitters right, the tweets.
[03:48:08.620 --> 03:48:11.141]  I'm on Twitter too, at Matt on air.
[03:48:11.141 --> 03:48:12.502]  I'm broadcasting from Chicago.
[03:48:12.722 --> 03:48:13.043]  We're good.
[03:48:23.320 --> 03:48:30.842]  Over 700 carjackings in Chicago in this year.
[03:48:30.842 --> 03:48:34.063]  And they're in certain neighborhoods.
[03:48:34.063 --> 03:48:37.385]  So you're safe if you're in downtown Chicago.
[03:48:37.385 --> 03:48:40.065]  You're safe if you're in certain suburbs.
[03:48:40.065 --> 03:48:44.947]  You're safe if you're in the airport areas and those communities.
[03:48:45.467 --> 03:48:52.855]  It's when you head to the west side and the south side where the carnage is really taking place that there's a lot of problems.
[03:48:52.855 --> 03:48:55.618]  So people know where to go and where to stay out of.
[03:48:55.618 --> 03:49:03.506]  Unfortunately, the people that live there and the human beings that are there every day are the ones that end up being caught in the crossfire.
[03:49:05.868 --> 03:49:11.591]  We're working on spreading this message because the news does not cover these deaths.
[03:49:11.591 --> 03:49:21.357]  When they play the 10 o'clock news on Channel 2, on Channel 5, on Channel 7, on Channel 9, you know, we've never had more news channels than ever before.
[03:49:21.357 --> 03:49:24.459]  And we've never had more news programs.
[03:49:24.459 --> 03:49:30.702]  It used to be they just had the 10 o'clock news, and now they have like the 5 o'clock news and the 6 o'clock news.
[03:49:30.702 --> 03:49:34.785]  And they'll talk about some new BS, you know,
[03:49:35.476 --> 03:49:39.160]  Unicorn Frappuccino that Starbucks is putting out.
[03:49:39.160 --> 03:49:45.348]  They'll talk about, they'll show people waiting in line for the new iPhone in downtown Chicago.
[03:49:46.465 --> 03:49:49.607]  And they don't show the names.
[03:49:49.607 --> 03:49:59.294]  And they don't say the names and they don't show the faces of the people that are being slaughtered every day as it's Las Vegas in slow motion every day here in Chicago.
[03:49:59.294 --> 03:50:01.255]  They don't talk about those people.
[03:50:01.255 --> 03:50:02.696]  Somebody needs to.
[03:50:02.696 --> 03:50:05.238]  And we're working on doing that in a bigger way.
[03:50:05.238 --> 03:50:06.618]  How do we do that here?
[03:50:06.618 --> 03:50:07.519]  And how can you do it?
[03:50:07.519 --> 03:50:11.542]  You hear people on InfoWarsaid all the time, share the links, share the links, share the links.
[03:50:11.542 --> 03:50:15.785]  The other way is for you to support these local stations that carry these shows.
[03:50:16.525 --> 03:50:25.416]  We, for instance, not only are we carrying the Alex Jones Show here in Chicago, but we're also carrying Real News with David Knight mornings from 8 a.m.
[03:50:25.416 --> 03:50:26.697]  Central to 11 a.m.
[03:50:26.697 --> 03:50:27.078]  Central.
[03:50:27.078 --> 03:50:27.738]  It's a great show.
[03:50:27.738 --> 03:50:32.965]  It's a great alternative to Glenn Beck and the other crap that the national syndicators put out.
[03:50:34.076 --> 03:50:42.603]  We carry The War Room with Owen Schroyer and sometimes Roger Stone when he's in and when he's not, you know, whether he's in or not.
[03:50:42.603 --> 03:50:53.892]  And Owen and The War Room is another great alternative to the afternoon programming that you are offered and force-fed around the country, where they're just talking about the same
[03:50:54.372 --> 03:50:54.933]  Crap.
[03:50:54.933 --> 03:50:58.675]  Mitch McConnell this and Paul Ryan that over and over again.
[03:50:58.675 --> 03:51:00.937]  The same dopey four conservative talk show.
[03:51:00.937 --> 03:51:02.138]  So it's really great.
[03:51:02.138 --> 03:51:05.400]  If you're a station manager, you've got to consider these shows.
[03:51:05.400 --> 03:51:13.085]  If you are a listener in those areas and you're listening to the radio station carrying Alex Jones right now, send them an email.
[03:51:13.085 --> 03:51:18.509]  Send that radio station an email and tell them that they should really take a look at Real News and they should really take a look at The War Room.
[03:51:19.009 --> 03:51:20.630]  We're doing it here in Chicago.
[03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:24.893]  Tell them WCKG is doing it in Market 3.
[03:51:24.893 --> 03:51:30.537]  And we're not just going to do it on AM 1530, we're building an FM radio station.
[03:51:30.537 --> 03:51:32.359]  And it isn't cheap, believe me.
[03:51:32.359 --> 03:51:38.283]  I could go broke building this FM radio station.
[03:51:38.283 --> 03:51:40.444]  And Alex talked about it a little bit earlier.
[03:51:40.444 --> 03:51:47.790]  We're building this FM 102.3, and right now it just covers a little 5 mile radius in Elmhurst, near the airport.
[03:51:48.750 --> 03:51:59.088]  And it's eventually, very soon, with your help, going to be covering parts of the Chicago area where this murdering is going on.
[03:51:59.088 --> 03:51:59.669]  And we can help.
[03:52:00.563 --> 03:52:04.747]  Bring light, bring to light to the people that aren't hearing this on the news.
[03:52:04.747 --> 03:52:07.169]  What is actually going on in their backyard?
[03:52:07.169 --> 03:52:12.714]  You can help us if you go to wckg.com slash support.
[03:52:12.714 --> 03:52:22.082]  The video that we had up there of Alex sharing why it's so important to support local radio stations has been removed by Facebook or YouTube.
[03:52:22.082 --> 03:52:23.623]  We're not sure why, but we're going to replace it.
[03:52:24.944 --> 03:52:44.735]  We could use your support because what happens is is the advertisers get pressured from the likes of Media Matters or the likes of other organizations and they leave and they try and pressure these radio stations like mine into carrying other sports programming or other network programming that isn't quite
[03:52:45.715 --> 03:52:48.378]  What is in line with what we're sharing?
[03:52:48.378 --> 03:52:51.120]  It doesn't quite get the truth out the same way.
[03:52:51.120 --> 03:52:52.462]  So we need your help.
[03:52:52.462 --> 03:53:01.891]  That comes in the form of donations, in the form of support, sponsorship support, whatever you can do, WCKG.com slash support.
[03:53:01.891 --> 03:53:03.793]  I want to talk about this Millie Weaver video.
[03:53:04.193 --> 03:53:12.335]  Millie Weaver, speaking of going into the areas where you know it's dangerous, you know, in Chicago we don't go to the south side where people are getting capped.
[03:53:12.335 --> 03:53:15.195]  We don't go to the west side where people are getting capped.
[03:53:15.195 --> 03:53:22.077]  Here Millie Weaver, and I'm looking at it with you, you can watch it at InfoWars.com slash show.
[03:53:22.077 --> 03:53:30.679]  I'm watching Millie Weaver literally going into the trenches here at an event in Texas where Hillary Clinton
[03:53:31.599 --> 03:53:34.722]  I was doing a book signing for, I don't even know the name of her book.
[03:53:34.722 --> 03:53:36.764]  It's getting to the point where I don't want to even promote it.
[03:53:36.764 --> 03:53:38.485]  I know that nobody's buying the damn book anyway.
[03:53:38.485 --> 03:53:40.067]  She's got to give it away.
[03:53:40.067 --> 03:53:51.136]  But if you watch this video, besides watching it with me as I share what I witnessed, you're going to want to watch this video later on tonight or when you have some time.
[03:53:51.136 --> 03:53:56.581]  And it really is, the title is Clinton Zombies Invade Austin.
[03:53:56.761 --> 03:53:58.862]  And that is the perfect title.
[03:53:58.862 --> 03:54:05.827]  I often refer to the masses as the zombie nation.
[03:54:05.827 --> 03:54:08.569]  And the zombie nation is really scary.
[03:54:08.569 --> 03:54:17.735]  You know, back a while ago, the CDC, the Center for Disease Control, even had this what to do in the case of a zombie apocalypse.
[03:54:17.735 --> 03:54:20.977]  And people laughed about it, and they went, oh, that's so cute!
[03:54:20.977 --> 03:54:24.820]  It's like it's related to the zombie TV shows and the zombie movies.
[03:54:25.720 --> 03:54:27.281]  It's code, you guys.
[03:54:27.281 --> 03:54:30.503]  They're not talking about the zombies in the TV shows.
[03:54:30.503 --> 03:54:39.028]  They're talking about the zombies that have been indoctrinated and been converted into people that will turn on you.
[03:54:39.028 --> 03:54:42.330]  Watch the zombies turn on Millie Weaver.
[03:54:43.030 --> 03:54:46.614]  Now, I'm not saying these people were always zombies.
[03:54:46.614 --> 03:54:50.198]  Some of them are wives and daughters and mothers.
[03:54:50.198 --> 03:55:01.512]  And somehow, over time, after they're smiling, and after they're just kind of engaging in conversation, and maybe they were at a bake sale earlier, they get in line at this Hillary Clinton event.
[03:55:02.512 --> 03:55:04.414]  And the zombies attack!
[03:55:04.414 --> 03:55:10.719]  There's zombies grabbing Millie's microphone, there's zombies, you can see, they don't quite shapeshift.
[03:55:10.719 --> 03:55:22.930]  And this is where people are gonna go, whoa, whoa, Dubiel, you, uh, you had me when you were talking about the If poem, you had me at Thanksgiving, you had me at leading your family, but then you talked about shapeshifting.
[03:55:22.930 --> 03:55:23.591]  Whoa!
[03:55:25.032 --> 03:55:30.276]  Well, not every shapeshifter is a literal shapeshifter.
[03:55:30.276 --> 03:55:31.017]  Okay?
[03:55:31.017 --> 03:55:33.118]  Watch these people.
[03:55:33.118 --> 03:55:38.663]  Watch them shapeshift from daughters and mothers and grandmas.
[03:55:38.663 --> 03:55:44.707]  Some of these grandmas pick their kids up and they take them for the McDonald's Happy Meal after they pick the kid up from daycare.
[03:55:44.707 --> 03:55:52.814]  And then they get in line at the Hillary event and they turn into zombie shapeshifters and start grabbing microphones from Millie Weaver.
[03:55:53.414 --> 03:55:55.256]  And here's one of the things I love about Millie.
[03:55:55.256 --> 03:55:55.917]  I don't know Millie.
[03:55:55.917 --> 03:55:56.978]  I've never met Millie.
[03:55:56.978 --> 03:55:57.358]  I don't think.
[03:55:57.358 --> 03:56:01.843]  I mean, I've been to InfoWars, you know, the Texas Command Center a couple of times.
[03:56:01.843 --> 03:56:04.226]  I don't think Millie was there back when I was there.
[03:56:04.226 --> 03:56:04.987]  But I don't know her.
[03:56:06.118 --> 03:56:10.080]  But I, I can, I've learned so much about her by watching her.
[03:56:10.080 --> 03:56:12.241]  Just like I said, don't tell show.
[03:56:12.241 --> 03:56:14.762]  I'm watching Millie Weaver and she's showing.
[03:56:14.762 --> 03:56:15.802]  She's showing big time.
[03:56:15.802 --> 03:56:19.604]  She's going through, the zombies are attacking.
[03:56:19.604 --> 03:56:21.024]  Brains!
[03:56:21.024 --> 03:56:22.345]  Brains!
[03:56:22.345 --> 03:56:24.065]  Millie Brains!
[03:56:24.065 --> 03:56:25.326]  Hilary Good!
[03:56:25.326 --> 03:56:26.767]  Millie Bad!
[03:56:26.767 --> 03:56:28.507]  Info Wars Bad!
[03:56:28.507 --> 03:56:29.548]  I can't wait till they...
[03:56:30.288 --> 03:56:33.630]  Use that clip and use it against me later.
[03:56:33.630 --> 03:56:38.873]  But the zombies are attacking, and Millie Weaver is just being Millie.
[03:56:38.873 --> 03:56:52.200]  She is just herself, smiling, maintaining her composure, staying assured in her self-awareness that what she's doing is asking questions on public property.
[03:56:52.200 --> 03:56:54.822]  And man, oh man, do the zombies attack.
[03:56:55.362 --> 03:56:59.644]  Reread that poem that I shared with you, this If, by Rudyard Kipling.
[03:56:59.644 --> 03:57:01.825]  I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name right.
[03:57:01.825 --> 03:57:03.026]  Maybe it's a woman that wrote it.
[03:57:03.026 --> 03:57:04.787]  I don't know if Rudyard is a man or a woman.
[03:57:04.787 --> 03:57:05.967]  It doesn't matter.
[03:57:05.967 --> 03:57:20.854]  Because Millie exemplifies, just like our president does, just like I see Alex, just like I see Rob do, just like I see Owen, just like I see David Knight, these people are exemplifying what is embodied in this poem.
[03:57:20.854 --> 03:57:21.855]  And you can too.
[03:57:22.655 --> 03:57:23.636]  It's called IF.
[03:57:23.636 --> 03:57:24.417]  It's worth reading.
[03:57:24.417 --> 03:57:25.337]  It's worth downloading.
[03:57:25.337 --> 03:57:26.918]  It's worth printing out.
[03:57:26.918 --> 03:57:28.239]  It's worth keeping.
[03:57:28.239 --> 03:57:32.703]  And I want to share with you what I witnessed our president doing in his press conference.
[03:57:32.703 --> 03:57:38.207]  The press conference last week, I couldn't find on the internet until it already happened.
[03:57:38.207 --> 03:57:40.669]  Live from Chicago for Alex Jones, it's Matt Dubio.
