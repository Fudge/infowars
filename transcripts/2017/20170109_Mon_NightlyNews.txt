[00:00:18.757 --> 00:00:20.978]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.078 --> 00:00:22.599]  It's January 9th, 2017.
[00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:24.340]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.621]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:28.763 --> 00:00:40.129]  Tonight, Hollywood hypocrites at the Golden Globe Awards verbally attack President-elect Donald Trump as Meryl Streep delivers her worst performance yet.
[00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:45.572]  When the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country
[00:00:46.352 --> 00:00:48.314]  Imitating a disabled reporter.
[00:00:48.694 --> 00:01:05.267]  Meanwhile, football fans get annoyed with ABC television during the NFL playoffs, as they run promos for the next episode of Black-ish, which features an African-American cast who are blatantly anti-Trump.
[00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:11.932]  Plus, Infowars Breitbart and the Drudge Report are in the crosshairs of the global elite.
[00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:15.254]  And they will stop at nothing to shut us down.
[00:01:15.654 --> 00:01:16.695]  Yeah, good luck with that.
[00:01:18.296 --> 00:01:21.358]  That's coming up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:18.099]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News, ladies and gentlemen, and the biggest story today, whether it was relevant or not, was Meryl Streep and her little performance at the Golden Globes last night.
[00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.745]  So we're going to start off this segment making fun of Meryl Streep and the utter failure that was her speech.
[00:03:24.227 --> 00:03:32.553]  It is worth mentioning, 2017 Golden Globes review, Jimmy Fallon flounders as host on a doll show.
[00:03:32.993 --> 00:03:36.215]  Now my response to this is, you know, it's gotta be tough for Fallon.
[00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:44.261]  Everybody knows now how pathetic this lot of people are that were at this event, and they now know the people there
[00:03:44.961 --> 00:03:47.403]  That they know that people don't care what they think.
[00:03:47.963 --> 00:03:49.184]  That's why we elected Trump.
[00:03:49.665 --> 00:03:56.149]  So you've got this whole glamour event, glitz and glamour, for all these special people that everyone is supposed to bow down to and praise.
[00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.111]  Except, wait, we don't care.
[00:03:59.532 --> 00:04:02.634]  So it must have been a tough act for Fallon, but apparently it was dull.
[00:04:02.774 --> 00:04:03.194]  I don't know.
[00:04:03.314 --> 00:04:03.935]  I didn't watch it.
[00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:06.517]  So perhaps maybe they should be thanking Meryl Streep.
[00:04:06.577 --> 00:04:12.661]  If she didn't make that absolutely pathetic speech, nobody would be talking about the Golden Globes last night.
[00:04:12.801 --> 00:04:15.863]  But she did, and Donald Trump, of course, has responded.
[00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:16.904]  He's responded on Twitter.
[00:04:17.244 --> 00:04:21.988]  He says that he is not surprised by Meryl Streep's Golden Globes speech.
[00:04:22.788 --> 00:04:26.589]  And again, I mentioned this earlier on the Alex Jones Show, but it's worth mentioning again.
[00:04:27.109 --> 00:04:29.950]  This woman could have gone up there and raised awareness.
[00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.271]  She could have talked about the victims of terror attacks that have been happening.
[00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:39.212]  She could have talked about the kidnapping victim that was also mentally challenged.
[00:04:39.252 --> 00:04:43.653]  She wants to knock Trump about the mentally challenged thing, which is totally taken out of context.
[00:04:43.953 --> 00:04:49.154]  Well, she could have stood up for the mentally challenged victim of a kidnapping and torture, but instead,
[00:04:49.614 --> 00:04:58.720]  This totally selfish woman who just wants attention on herself decided she was going to take that podium to talk about Donald Trump.
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.124]  Don't worry about thanking all of the people that put you in the position to receive that prestigious award.
[00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:06.205]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:05:06.585 --> 00:05:07.646]  Put them behind you.
[00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:08.907]  Who cares about them?
[00:05:09.207 --> 00:05:10.048]  You're Meryl Streep.
[00:05:10.388 --> 00:05:13.471]  Everybody wants to hear about what you think about Donald Trump.
[00:05:13.551 --> 00:05:21.657]  Now, I have to give credit to somebody shocking here, but Piers Morgan wrote a little op-ed for Daily Mail.
[00:05:22.478 --> 00:05:29.384]  Headline, sorry Merrill, but that hypocritical anti-Trump rant was easily the worst performance of your career.
[00:05:29.965 --> 00:05:34.969]  And then the sub-headline, apart from a time you gave a child rapist a standing ovation.
[00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:36.130]  Oh, that's right!
[00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:37.711]  Piers Morgan?
[00:05:38.272 --> 00:05:38.992]  My gosh!
[00:05:39.773 --> 00:05:47.818]  At the 2003 Oscars, Meryl Streep leapt to her feet and gave child rapist Roman Polanski a standing ovation.
[00:05:48.358 --> 00:05:55.422]  He wished he could have been there, but unfortunately he would have been arrested had he made that event.
[00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:56.323]  But Meryl Streep
[00:05:56.983 --> 00:06:02.785]  Boy, she wanted to make sure that she stood and applauded loudly for the child rapist, Roman Polanski.
[00:06:02.845 --> 00:06:04.786]  So, good job there, Meryl Streep.
[00:06:04.826 --> 00:06:05.286]  But you know what?
[00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:06.186]  I guess that makes sense.
[00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:15.390]  You supported Hillary Clinton, who also defended a child rapist, and in fact, made sure a child rapist was able to get off scout-free.
[00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.491]  So that's nice, Meryl Streep.
[00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:18.151]  I hope that that
[00:06:18.931 --> 00:06:19.991]  Makes you sleep well at night.
[00:06:20.492 --> 00:06:26.093]  Now, Camille Paglia has also written an op-ed, How to Age Disgracefully in Hollywood.
[00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:31.615]  Well, you could dress like Madonna with your breasts on display at the age of 50.
[00:06:32.576 --> 00:06:33.616]  Absolutely disgusting.
[00:06:34.236 --> 00:06:48.967]  Or you could go the Meryl Streep route and decide to politicize everything and when you get awarded a great honor you just go ahead and embarrass yourself and you decide to take that podium to insult and politicize the entire event.
[00:06:49.787 --> 00:06:55.411]  But you know, we are seeing how to age disgracefully here with the Clintons.
[00:06:55.812 --> 00:07:07.941]  You know, honestly, you want to talk about aging disgracefully or just not being able to accept defeat, you would really want to look at the Democrats and people like John McCain, John Kerry, the Obamas, the Clintons.
[00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:13.325]  These are the people that don't know how to age gracefully or accept defeat gracefully.
[00:07:13.665 --> 00:07:15.607]  They really have made themselves look like
[00:07:16.467 --> 00:07:20.909]  Petulant little children, and Meryl Streep now takes the cake on that.
[00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:33.675]  Now, if you were watching NFL football yesterday with the hundreds of millions of people around the world that were, you probably saw an ABC ad for their new show, Black-ish.
[00:07:34.095 --> 00:07:35.436]  Now, I happened to see this.
[00:07:36.698 --> 00:07:40.443]  And the ad, you know, it's a promo ad for their TV show, Black-ish.
[00:07:41.064 --> 00:07:46.192]  And they have that woman on talking to some other black people around what appears to be a dinner table or something.
[00:07:46.993 --> 00:07:50.978]  And she says, of course, they're politicizing the conversation around the dinner table.
[00:07:51.963 --> 00:07:54.505]  And she says, oh, I voted for Trump.
[00:07:54.985 --> 00:07:58.208]  And all the black people around the dinner table get all upset and make a big deal of it.
[00:07:58.288 --> 00:08:02.050]  Wanda Sykes is actually in the scene as well, kicking and screaming.
[00:08:02.531 --> 00:08:07.655]  Wanda Sykes actually may have said she was going to leave the country if Trump won.
[00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:08.675]  I'm going to have to double check that.
[00:08:08.715 --> 00:08:11.878]  But I think that Wanda Sykes might be needing to catch a plane to Canada.
[00:08:12.418 --> 00:08:12.919]  But you know what?
[00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:13.499]  Here's what I'll say.
[00:08:15.066 --> 00:08:23.574]  It was obvious that they took the shot at Donald Trump, and they used the whole politicized, polarized culture that we're in right now with the election.
[00:08:24.555 --> 00:08:38.389]  I don't know if they were trolling people to get them to watch, or they were trying to make anti-Trump propaganda, but that was the promo that they ran, saying a white girl saying, I voted for Trump, and then a bunch of black people getting upset about it.
[00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.190]  But I'll withhold judgment.
[00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.211]  Maybe it was just the ultimate troll.
[00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:43.552]  There's the ad right there.
[00:08:43.572 --> 00:08:44.432]  There's Wanda Sykes.
[00:08:44.592 --> 00:08:45.953]  I told you she was kicking and screaming.
[00:08:45.973 --> 00:08:47.254]  I don't make this stuff up, folks.
[00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:48.675]  But there it is.
[00:08:48.735 --> 00:08:51.917]  Y'all, I voted for Trump and then they all get upset like it's some sort of a big deal.
[00:08:52.537 --> 00:08:53.197]  But again, you know what?
[00:08:53.357 --> 00:08:55.659]  Maybe they're just, maybe they're just, this is just a troll.
[00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:58.761]  Maybe they just trolled everybody and they just wanted to increase ratings.
[00:08:59.201 --> 00:09:00.942]  The show looks a little funny, I'm not gonna lie.
[00:09:00.982 --> 00:09:07.626]  But they did want to run the anti-Trump propaganda while the hundreds of a million of Americans were watching football.
[00:09:08.683 --> 00:09:11.285]  And of course, Al Sharpton has to get involved.
[00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:17.710]  Al Sharpton promises a season of civil disobedience in response to the Sessions nomination.
[00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.511]  They're going really hard off Sessions.
[00:09:21.293 --> 00:09:24.935]  The Trump camp is not too happy about the attacks on Sessions.
[00:09:25.656 --> 00:09:29.319]  What Sharpton said, we're not just doing this to be doing it.
[00:09:29.359 --> 00:09:31.100]  We do it because it can lead to change.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:37.845]  And believe me, there will be a season of civil disobedience, particularly around the Sessions nomination.
[00:09:39.106 --> 00:09:42.068]  Okay Al Sharpton, you're not just going to be doing it to be doing it.
[00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:43.648]  It's going to lead to change.
[00:09:44.249 --> 00:09:45.649]  Really, what kind of change is that?
[00:09:45.689 --> 00:09:47.010]  What kind of change have we seen?
[00:09:47.070 --> 00:10:02.358]  So folks, before I move on to the rest here, so I just went through this stack of news of people politicizing Trump and of course wanting to cast this shadow on Donald Trump that he's a racist or that if you're black you shouldn't like Donald Trump.
[00:10:03.305 --> 00:10:16.312]  They're continuing to do this even though we just had a mentally challenged young man kidnapped and tortured over the course of two days in a polarized and racially charged event.
[00:10:17.412 --> 00:10:28.437]  It's really sad to me that this can go on and that you're still going to have people like Al Sharpton and Meryl Streep continue to foment this divide in our country.
[00:10:28.978 --> 00:10:37.802]  Continue to foment the tensions that have been so polarized and politicized over the course of the last couple years and really the last eight years under Barack Obama.
[00:10:38.382 --> 00:10:57.760]  But these people like Al Sharpton and Meryl Streep are so pathetic that even in the face of an innocent man being kidnapped and tortured and then it comes out a politically and racially charged event, they're still going to sit here and foment and try to throw oil on that fire.
[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.623]  I truly cannot believe that these people have gone that low.
[00:11:01.723 --> 00:11:03.225]  What is your problem, Meryl Streep?
[00:11:03.325 --> 00:11:04.826]  What is your problem, Al Sharpton?
[00:11:05.407 --> 00:11:11.152]  Are you guys really trying to foment anger and civil war in this country or are you just that stupid?
[00:11:11.933 --> 00:11:15.176]  That's what I'd like to know because there's no other way around this.
[00:11:16.237 --> 00:11:18.439]  Especially if you're going to sit here and claim that, you know,
[00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:20.871]  You care about people.
[00:11:21.572 --> 00:11:26.333]  Meryl Streep, I care about the mentally challenged person that Trump was making fun of, even though that didn't happen.
[00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:28.734]  Well, where are you on the Chicago kidnapping?
[00:11:29.394 --> 00:11:39.437]  And if you don't think for one second your rhetoric and your little speech that you gave at the Golden Globes isn't going to add to those tensions, well, you really are as dumb as you look.
[00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:46.068]  Speaking of looking dumb, this is the latest thing from magic wand land.
[00:11:46.328 --> 00:11:49.309]  Obama said, I don't know what type of magic wand Trump's going to wave.
[00:11:49.369 --> 00:11:51.670]  Well, Trump waved it again.
[00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.451]  Alibaba job boom.
[00:11:53.631 --> 00:11:58.233]  Jack Ma chats with Trump about how to create one million U.S.
[00:11:58.273 --> 00:11:59.634]  jobs over five years.
[00:11:59.714 --> 00:12:06.817]  President-elect Donald Trump said he had a great meeting with the Alibaba executive chairman on Monday when they discussed one million new U.S.
[00:12:06.877 --> 00:12:07.238]  jobs.
[00:12:08.318 --> 00:12:09.819]  This is what the chairman said.
[00:12:09.859 --> 00:12:11.140]  We're focused on small business.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:17.985]  We specifically talked about supporting 1 million small businesses, especially in the Midwest of America, where Trump dominated.
[00:12:18.385 --> 00:12:24.589]  Small businesses on the platform of selling products, agriculture products, and America services to China and Asia.
[00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:27.691]  Because we're big in Asia, Alibaba will create 1 million U.S.
[00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:32.895]  jobs by enabling 1 million American small businesses and farmers to sell American goods to China.
[00:12:33.575 --> 00:12:36.737]  Wow.
[00:12:37.438 --> 00:12:38.898]  I don't know.
[00:12:39.479 --> 00:12:42.040]  Is Donald Trump a character from Harry Potter?
[00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:43.461]  I don't know how.
[00:12:43.581 --> 00:12:45.102]  Where did he get this magic wand?
[00:12:45.142 --> 00:12:50.585]  Barack Obama needs to send in his crack investigative team with the FBI and the CIA to figure this out.
[00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:52.346]  They figured out the Russian hacking scandal.
[00:12:52.366 --> 00:12:53.267]  That's how Hillary lost.
[00:12:53.587 --> 00:12:56.709]  Maybe they can figure out what type of magic wand Donald Trump has.
[00:12:56.749 --> 00:12:58.610]  Obama might need to use that to save his legacy.
[00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.432]  But he waves it again!
[00:13:00.792 --> 00:13:04.937]  Fiat to invest $1 billion in Michigan-Ohio plants, creating 2,000 jobs.
[00:13:07.694 --> 00:13:08.154]  The U.S.
[00:13:08.334 --> 00:13:19.463]  arm of the automaker Fiat Chrysler announced on Sunday it would invest a total of $1 billion in Michigan and Ohio, adding 2,000 jobs to the United States.
[00:13:19.943 --> 00:13:29.050]  The announcement, in what the economy said was the second phase of a plan it first made public a year ago, came days after the Ford Motor Company, this is another Trump magic wand,
[00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:35.875]  The Ford Motor Company decided to scrap a plan to build its factory in Mexico, instead opening it in Michigan.
[00:13:35.955 --> 00:13:38.977]  So Trump continues to wave that magic wand.
[00:13:38.997 --> 00:13:43.721]  You know, it's actually amazing because you can actually kind of monitor everything that Trump is doing.
[00:13:43.761 --> 00:13:46.022]  They have the camera right there at Trump Tower.
[00:13:46.683 --> 00:13:49.425]  You can pretty much figure out who he's meeting with every day.
[00:13:49.865 --> 00:13:51.847]  So it's a pretty transparent thing here.
[00:13:52.487 --> 00:13:56.830]  And let's remember, Obama said that the economy would be the number one thing
[00:13:57.751 --> 00:13:58.512]  We're good to go.
[00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:26.778]  More Americans are now on food stamps than they were when Obama took office, and Americans out of the labor force has just entered an all-time high.
[00:14:26.818 --> 00:14:37.748]  So you can use these stats to push whatever point or whatever argument you want to make, but those are the facts, and the fact is, Obama, that Trump doesn't have a magic wand.
[00:14:38.048 --> 00:14:40.690]  He's just actually working really hard and meeting with
[00:14:41.491 --> 00:14:46.995]  People who aren't just politicians in order to create business opportunities in the United States.
[00:14:47.015 --> 00:14:51.019]  And he's also going to get some of those regulations to make it easier for small businesses to operate.
[00:14:51.299 --> 00:14:54.662]  And not to mention all the tax cuts that are going to make it easier for entrepreneurs.
[00:14:55.478 --> 00:15:02.582]  Now, we had a huge hearing about the Russian hacking scandal, but somehow this didn't manage to get mentioned.
[00:15:02.942 --> 00:15:06.524]  Someone is trying to take down the Drudge Report and it's a mystery who's behind it.
[00:15:06.984 --> 00:15:15.689]  The Drudge Report, the highly trafficked, the most highly trafficked conservative news website, possibly in the world, has been knocked offline for extended periods during the past two weeks.
[00:15:16.409 --> 00:15:19.771]  And Matt Drudge is saying that this is a DDoS attack.
[00:15:19.791 --> 00:15:21.072]  He said it multiple times.
[00:15:21.952 --> 00:15:23.692]  This is something that's happened to InfoWars.
[00:15:23.712 --> 00:15:25.253]  This is something we've been warned about.
[00:15:25.733 --> 00:15:34.635]  And this is happening at really unprecedented levels as far as the number that is coming in on these DDoS attacks.
[00:15:34.675 --> 00:15:37.696]  But again, this is not mentioned in the hearings.
[00:15:37.796 --> 00:15:42.257]  And the entire time they wanted to remind you, this is not a partisan issue.
[00:15:42.297 --> 00:15:43.597]  This is a bipartisan thing.
[00:15:43.617 --> 00:15:45.958]  We're just trying to make it safe for Americans to operate.
[00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:47.058]  We don't want people hacking.
[00:15:47.538 --> 00:15:55.465]  Well then, how come no mention of the record DDoS attacks that Drudge has come under multiple times and even here at InfoWars?
[00:15:55.485 --> 00:15:56.686]  How come no mention of that?
[00:15:57.067 --> 00:15:58.588]  Aren't we citizens?
[00:15:59.108 --> 00:16:00.369]  I thought you cared about us!
[00:16:00.409 --> 00:16:01.611]  You didn't want us to be hacked!
[00:16:01.951 --> 00:16:11.699]  No, you're just trying to make up excuses why Hillary Clinton lost the election and you don't want to admit it's by your own flaws and just the pathetic nature of the campaign that she ran.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.322]  When they go low, we go high!
[00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:17.549]  I'll tell you what's getting higher.
[00:16:17.889 --> 00:16:23.394]  Venezuela's minimum wage just got brought up for the fifth time in a calendar year.
[00:16:23.434 --> 00:16:34.563]  Venezuela's socialist president Maduro announced on Sunday a 50% hike in the minimum wage and pensions, the fifth increase over the last year to help shield workers from the world's highest inflation rate.
[00:16:34.963 --> 00:16:36.084]  So here you go, folks.
[00:16:36.525 --> 00:16:37.606]  You want your socialism?
[00:16:38.752 --> 00:16:40.192]  You want your high minimum wage?
[00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:48.955]  Go ahead and take a look at what's going on in Venezuela right now, and then you tell me if you still want that minimum wage and that socialism.
[00:16:49.015 --> 00:16:51.076]  Of course, they'll say, oh, well, this is just one case.
[00:16:51.116 --> 00:16:52.336]  We don't have to be like Venezuela.
[00:16:52.817 --> 00:16:58.759]  Well, do a study of socialism and see how it goes most of the time.
[00:16:58.959 --> 00:16:59.839]  But, hey!
[00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.420]  Maybe that's what you're into.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:10.327]  Maybe you're into hyperinflation, maybe you're into minimum wage driving the economy down, and people starving on the street having to turn over trucks and eat the food off of the truck.
[00:17:10.347 --> 00:17:12.589]  Maybe that's what you're into if you're a socialist, apparently.
[00:17:13.009 --> 00:17:15.692]  Hillary Clinton receives ovation at the color purple.
[00:17:15.732 --> 00:17:19.575]  There was so much irony in this, I don't even know if I can properly cover it.
[00:17:19.915 --> 00:17:27.721]  Hillary Clinton, who has kept a relatively low public profile since losing the presidential election, showed up to the final performance of the color purple
[00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:33.024]  Revelling in the story of a beleaguered woman who triumphs over the oppressive men in her life.
[00:17:33.404 --> 00:17:38.747]  Now, of course, this is a story about a woman who is able to overcome all this oppression.
[00:17:39.247 --> 00:17:42.949]  And it's people cheering Hillary Clinton, one of the most racist people.
[00:17:42.969 --> 00:17:45.831]  I mean, folks, she called black people super predators.
[00:17:46.011 --> 00:17:47.331]  She's friends with Robert Byrd.
[00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:48.532]  I don't need to go down the history.
[00:17:48.552 --> 00:17:48.992]  You know it.
[00:17:49.132 --> 00:17:56.476]  But she receives standing ovations from the crowd of the color purple on Broadway.
[00:17:57.489 --> 00:18:10.000]  Now let's recall, when Mike Pence went to a Broadway show, they called him out and jeered and scorned him, but here you go, the crowd chanted, we love you, Hillary.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.001]  Unbelievable.
[00:18:12.722 --> 00:18:18.066]  Hillary Clinton's color revolution with the color purple goes on as planned.
[00:18:18.427 --> 00:18:22.089]  Gun shares fall as anti-Second Amendment threat fades.
[00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:27.414]  Now I did a story last week about how Obama was the best gun salesman in the history of America.
[00:18:27.814 --> 00:18:28.374]  How gun...
[00:18:29.335 --> 00:18:32.696]  Sales have increased just non-stop basically.
[00:18:32.756 --> 00:18:35.197]  Every year Obama's been in office, but now the shares are down.
[00:18:35.477 --> 00:18:35.918]  Guess what?
[00:18:36.118 --> 00:18:37.818]  You don't threaten to take people's guns.
[00:18:38.178 --> 00:18:41.200]  They stop buying them like they're going out of style.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.920]  It's amazing how that works.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.261]  Obama, you keep telling us not to elect Trump.
[00:18:45.421 --> 00:18:47.642]  We go ahead and elect Trump.
[00:18:47.982 --> 00:18:49.323]  So, that's just what you got.
[00:18:49.383 --> 00:18:52.424]  More coming up on the InfoWars Nightly News on the other side.
[00:19:01.584 --> 00:19:06.287]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States.
[00:19:06.947 --> 00:19:15.653]  And that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.813 --> 00:19:16.854]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.514 --> 00:19:18.675]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.155 --> 00:19:22.337]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.
[00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.319]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:58.179]  These are huge specials.
[00:20:58.639 --> 00:21:00.320]  Silver Bullet Coil Silver, 50% off.
[00:21:01.581 --> 00:21:03.881]  Brain Force Plus, 33% off.
[00:21:04.222 --> 00:21:06.843]  Winter Sun Vitamin D, 25% off.
[00:21:07.323 --> 00:21:10.104]  And again, a lot of these are selling out as we speak or have sold out.
[00:21:10.384 --> 00:21:12.745]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:21:12.805 --> 00:21:15.526]  Bio True Selenium, 30% off.
[00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:18.868]  And then let me finish up with this, the Coup De Grace.
[00:21:19.608 --> 00:21:23.630]  Store-wide free shipping until New Year's Day.
[00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:26.412]  Store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:21:26.812 --> 00:21:36.637]  On the non-GMO heirloom seeds, and the Trump is my president shirts, and Hillary for prison 2017 shirts, and deport George Soros the goblin globalist specials.
[00:21:37.217 --> 00:21:38.518]  Store-wide free shipping.
[00:21:39.738 --> 00:21:45.500]  50 to 30 percent off on scores of items and all of these are super high quality products.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.501]  They help fund the spearhead in the fight against the globalists and they are game changers.
[00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:54.342]  We couldn't have built this operation without you.
[00:21:54.502 --> 00:21:56.922]  So you're not standing beside us or behind us.
[00:21:57.302 --> 00:21:58.723]  You are standing at the heart
[00:21:59.423 --> 00:21:59.623]  Thank you.
[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.
[00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:44.921]  So again, I want to encourage you all, take advantage of the biggest sales of 2016 with Christmas sales extended with free shipping store-wide and 50 to 30% off on high-quality supplements and many other items at InfoWarsTore.com
[00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:46.762]  And Infowarslife.com.
[00:22:47.162 --> 00:22:51.324]  I'm Alex Jones signing off from the Central Texas News Center in Austin.
[00:22:51.384 --> 00:22:58.747]  Go to Infowarsstore.com today for 30-50% off specials while supplies last plus free shipping or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:23:12.921 --> 00:23:15.264]  Obama wanted ISIS to grow, close quote.
[00:23:15.904 --> 00:23:16.985]  They just want it to grow.
[00:23:18.621 --> 00:23:20.322]  It's Al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia.
[00:23:20.382 --> 00:23:21.782]  It's an invasion of Syria.
[00:23:22.083 --> 00:23:23.263]  That's been declassified.
[00:23:23.483 --> 00:23:39.811]  And they sit there with this trillion pound creature in the living room, telling us we're stupid and conspiracy theorists, when I have Colonel Schaeffer, the former head of the anti-Al-Qaeda operation, with over a thousand people under him, trying to hunt down Al-Qaeda for four years.
[00:23:40.711 --> 00:23:46.274]  And I've had, you name it, congressmen on, Walter Jones, everybody that's seen the secret documents.
[00:23:47.216 --> 00:23:50.617]  And if you think that's high up, imagine who I talk to on the telephone.
[00:23:50.977 --> 00:23:52.338]  As high as it goes.
[00:23:52.678 --> 00:23:53.738]  And everybody already knows that.
[00:23:53.798 --> 00:23:57.219]  When they're doing the big invasion of Syria, calling it a civil war, just like they've done in Libya.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.581]  The West starts a civil war with jihadis, out of Saudi Arabia and other areas.
[00:24:02.121 --> 00:24:04.102]  But now in Syria, it's easier for troops to get to.
[00:24:04.142 --> 00:24:05.942]  They're coming in from all over the world.
[00:24:06.402 --> 00:24:14.625]  Jihadis from Russia, jihadis from America, the UK, Australia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Serbia, Albania.
[00:24:14.645 --> 00:24:16.166]  I mean, they're just pouring in.
[00:24:16.806 --> 00:24:19.048]  For the big jihad to get their own house, get their own land.
[00:24:19.268 --> 00:24:21.890]  You come take the country, you get houses, swimming pools, everything.
[00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:23.291]  You get the businesses, the oil wells.
[00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:26.074]  Everything that Syria ever built in thousands of years, you get it.
[00:24:26.574 --> 00:24:30.537]  Oh yes, the Council on Foreign Relations private meetings that Hillary and John Kerry were at.
[00:24:30.938 --> 00:24:32.279]  You think somebody recorded those?
[00:24:32.659 --> 00:24:34.180]  You think somebody recorded those?
[00:24:34.381 --> 00:24:34.561]  Us?
[00:24:34.921 --> 00:24:37.243]  You think we don't have people everywhere, jackass?
[00:24:37.603 --> 00:24:38.624]  It's all out there.
[00:24:39.064 --> 00:24:41.667]  So damaging, it may destroy this country.
[00:24:42.327 --> 00:24:45.989]  But before you're able to strangle it for sure and destroy it, it's going to be released.
[00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.810]  All of it!
[00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.012]  So, you broke your deal with Trump, you weasels.
[00:24:50.812 --> 00:24:52.853]  Because a lot of this probably doesn't need to come out so bad.
[00:24:52.873 --> 00:24:55.575]  It needs to be reformed, taken care of, people need to be dealt with.
[00:24:55.595 --> 00:24:57.136]  A lot of folks need to get cancer.
[00:24:57.556 --> 00:24:58.817]  We're the real fast acting type.
[00:24:59.337 --> 00:25:00.178]  They need to agree to it.
[00:25:01.374 --> 00:25:02.755]  But no, you're going to go on to the end.
[00:25:02.775 --> 00:25:03.276]  You're not going to stop.
[00:25:03.296 --> 00:25:06.038]  You're going to try to keep trying to sabotage things once Trump gets in.
[00:25:06.078 --> 00:25:06.699]  We understand that.
[00:25:07.059 --> 00:25:08.180]  We know you're not going to go away.
[00:25:08.461 --> 00:25:10.402]  We understand you're never going to back off.
[00:25:10.482 --> 00:25:10.983]  We get it.
[00:25:11.363 --> 00:25:12.544]  And so you want to have a big fight?
[00:25:12.564 --> 00:25:13.485]  You want to have a big civil war?
[00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:14.306]  Feel your hand!
[00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:14.766]  Go ahead!
[00:25:15.728 --> 00:25:18.349]  You don't think everybody's been running around forever getting ready for this?
[00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:20.489]  You stupid, arrogant people.
[00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:25.130]  You'd hijacked the top of the country, you'd looted us, you'd robbed us seven ways to Sunday, but you had to rub it in.
[00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:31.631]  You had to get up on TV like a bunch of megalomaniacs and go, and your kids belong to us and the state and we ripped you off of Obamacare and got the public stump!
[00:25:32.711 --> 00:25:39.113]  A bunch of weird chicken-neck Harvard guys having little wimp celebrations about how they destroyed America and how they were better than us.
[00:25:39.393 --> 00:25:40.413]  Yeah, you're about to find out.
[00:25:41.013 --> 00:25:42.793]  So here's the big announcement, just in total.
[00:25:43.373 --> 00:25:45.594]  It's a labyrinth of evidence.
[00:25:46.114 --> 00:25:47.374]  The globalists are losing everywhere.
[00:25:47.894 --> 00:25:50.895]  People don't want this tyrannical New World Order global government model.
[00:25:51.555 --> 00:25:53.535]  We're not even debating whether world government's good or bad.
[00:25:53.575 --> 00:25:55.076]  Let's just cut that out for academic reasons.
[00:25:55.916 --> 00:26:07.838]  This world government is nothing but a corporate looting arm which admits it wants a post-industrial world, the end of nation states, only trade corridors, 99% of stuff collapses, and then the elites have high-tech city states.
[00:26:08.638 --> 00:26:11.621]  That are heavily guarded and controlled and everybody else lives in squalor.
[00:26:11.641 --> 00:26:14.103]  And people say, oh, there's a movie about that.
[00:26:14.123 --> 00:26:15.224]  There's books, Hunger Games.
[00:26:15.605 --> 00:26:16.886]  I told you this 20 years ago.
[00:26:17.626 --> 00:26:19.208]  I put it in films 15 years ago.
[00:26:19.528 --> 00:26:22.010]  No, that's art imitating life, folks.
[00:26:22.271 --> 00:26:23.192]  It's what's going on.
[00:26:23.772 --> 00:26:24.613]  So here's the big announcement.
[00:26:24.853 --> 00:26:26.614]  WikiLeaks and a whole bunch of other groups.
[00:26:26.654 --> 00:26:28.315]  WikiLeaks is just some branding name.
[00:26:28.495 --> 00:26:31.197]  Obama and the globalists desperately want to keep Trump out of office.
[00:26:31.437 --> 00:26:32.958]  Globalism is failing all over the world.
[00:26:33.379 --> 00:26:35.820]  Nationalism and populism is surging.
[00:26:35.841 --> 00:26:40.824]  The elite in every major publication admit to themselves they are burning down in a day.
[00:26:40.904 --> 00:26:42.045]  Babylon's burning in a day.
[00:26:42.365 --> 00:26:46.528]  I mean, the next few years is like a minute in the scheme of human history.
[00:26:46.928 --> 00:26:48.009]  So a day is like a year.
[00:26:48.449 --> 00:26:50.111]  So there's this war going on currently.
[00:26:50.956 --> 00:26:54.257]  And they've told him, OK, all this horrible stuff, we don't want to release more.
[00:26:54.718 --> 00:26:55.138]  Stop it.
[00:26:55.218 --> 00:26:55.898]  Admit your beat.
[00:26:56.058 --> 00:26:56.619]  Back off.
[00:26:57.079 --> 00:26:58.079]  Let us cut the taxes.
[00:26:58.099 --> 00:26:59.260]  Let us resuscitate the country.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:04.262]  Just stop this ritual of abusing America for your own personal weird leftist mind control.
[00:27:04.582 --> 00:27:04.982]  Stop it.
[00:27:05.542 --> 00:27:07.083]  And they went, OK, we're going to stop it.
[00:27:07.443 --> 00:27:11.345]  And then came right back attacking behind the scenes and now publicly.
[00:27:11.645 --> 00:27:15.447]  And so when they say, oh, there's Russian agents hacked us, the kernel of truth is
[00:27:16.247 --> 00:27:25.101]  Our military and our patriots checkmated Obama with the proof of this and said, you let us now take these groups out or we're going to release all the info.
[00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:26.863]  And again, Obama said, OK, I will.
[00:27:27.044 --> 00:27:28.466]  But then always sabotage the missions.
[00:27:28.666 --> 00:27:29.267]  It's the same deal.
[00:27:29.407 --> 00:27:30.629]  OK, I'll back off.
[00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:31.490]  But then he never really does.
[00:27:32.051 --> 00:27:35.273]  So they've been through this six or seven times now with Obama and the globalists.
[00:27:35.453 --> 00:27:37.594]  So the Russians said, OK, we'll talk to your military.
[00:27:38.034 --> 00:27:39.415]  Sure, we'll talk to your chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
[00:27:39.635 --> 00:27:40.856]  Sure, we'll talk to all the heads of your military.
[00:27:41.076 --> 00:27:41.876]  Oh, you want us to come in?
[00:27:41.896 --> 00:27:42.656]  You know we're already there.
[00:27:42.676 --> 00:27:44.978]  You know we're already losing thousands of troops every few months.
[00:27:45.478 --> 00:27:47.479]  Oh, sure, you're not going to give us a problem if Air Force comes in.
[00:27:47.959 --> 00:27:49.320]  OK, we'll divide the country in three parts.
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.400]  We'll even go with your previous plan.
[00:27:50.661 --> 00:27:51.901]  Sure, we just want to stop World War III.
[00:27:51.941 --> 00:27:52.582]  Boom, we're coming in.
[00:27:52.622 --> 00:27:52.962]  They come in.
[00:27:53.382 --> 00:27:54.242]  And they join U.S.
[00:27:54.282 --> 00:27:58.885]  military forces now there who know everything they do has been given to the ISIS people.
[00:27:59.585 --> 00:28:01.146]  We're good to go.
[00:28:23.527 --> 00:28:26.673]  We've got congressmen introducing bills to stop funding ISIS.
[00:28:26.693 --> 00:28:28.777]  We have Democrats coming out and speaking out as well.
[00:28:28.817 --> 00:28:34.829]  We have Democrats coming out and saying, Obama, we got hacked two years ago in the big giant...
[00:28:35.905 --> 00:28:37.085]  Hack of all time.
[00:28:37.105 --> 00:28:37.626]  14 million U.S.
[00:28:37.646 --> 00:28:39.866]  governments' names, infos, code names, everything.
[00:28:40.166 --> 00:28:40.887]  All their operatives.
[00:28:40.947 --> 00:28:41.787]  Total roll up.
[00:28:42.447 --> 00:28:43.828]  There's no way they just got that.
[00:28:43.868 --> 00:28:45.028]  You gave it to them, didn't you?
[00:28:45.468 --> 00:28:45.928]  Oh, that's right.
[00:28:46.109 --> 00:28:47.209]  Oh, the Russians are getting us.
[00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.829]  Oh, the Russians.
[00:28:48.069 --> 00:28:52.531]  Obama rolled up our entire intelligence network worldwide to the shycoms.
[00:28:53.011 --> 00:28:56.772]  That's why the intelligence agencies are in total war mode against Obama.
[00:28:56.932 --> 00:28:58.713]  Because they realize it's a triple cross.
[00:29:03.447 --> 00:29:13.492]  Now most of you know that the mainstream media has been very critical of anyone suggesting that Barack Obama's birth certificate might be a fraud.
[00:29:13.812 --> 00:29:16.053]  And believe me, they got the memo.
[00:29:16.373 --> 00:29:19.014]  I'm talking about the people who work for the mainstream media.
[00:29:19.314 --> 00:29:22.856]  They know that Obama's birth certificate is off limits.
[00:29:23.476 --> 00:29:24.256]  You don't go there.
[00:29:24.637 --> 00:29:28.878]  Unless, of course, someone like Donald Trump shows up and starts asking questions.
[00:29:29.459 --> 00:29:39.263]  Or if Alex Jones brings it up, that's when the establishment media goes into full attack mode and they come to Obama's rescue.
[00:29:40.003 --> 00:29:51.745]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist and operator of the website InfoWars, which seems to be a place where Trump gets a lot of his information.
[00:29:52.265 --> 00:29:57.026]  Jones can take credit for spearheading some of the most outrageous theories on the Internet.
[00:29:57.166 --> 00:30:04.687]  Jones' theories reach tens of millions each month and are now often echoed by the next president of the United States.
[00:30:05.187 --> 00:30:06.828]  Take President Obama's birth.
[00:30:07.308 --> 00:30:09.008]  Trump comes along and said,
[00:30:10.037 --> 00:30:16.600]  Now, I want you all to listen very carefully because what I'm about to say is very important and I want to be clear so there's no misunderstanding.
[00:30:27.543 --> 00:30:34.611]  We are not saying that Barack Obama was born outside of the United States and that he is not a US citizen.
[00:30:35.192 --> 00:30:40.578]  We're not even claiming that Communist Frank Marshall Davis is Barack Obama's father.
[00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:42.461]  Fact is, we just don't know.
[00:30:43.021 --> 00:30:48.143]  I personally believe Obama's father is Frank Marshall Davis, but this investigation does not prove that.
[00:30:48.604 --> 00:30:51.225]  What we do know is significant.
[00:30:51.705 --> 00:31:01.889]  Forensic evidence proves without a doubt that the official birth certificate belonging to Barack Obama, the President of the United States, is a fake.
[00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:10.253]  As far as the document is concerned, we had two different forensic experts, two different disciplines, two different continents review our information.
[00:31:10.785 --> 00:31:12.406]  And all came to the same conclusion.
[00:31:12.566 --> 00:31:14.187]  The document is completely fraudulent.
[00:31:14.287 --> 00:31:15.167]  It's inauthentic.
[00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:17.368]  It's not what it represents itself to be.
[00:31:17.889 --> 00:31:20.370]  What does this say about the mainstream news media?
[00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:25.372]  Because we've been covering this for a long time and they refuse to follow this.
[00:31:25.812 --> 00:31:30.715]  And I still, I expected at least a little more participation after this press conference.
[00:31:31.115 --> 00:31:32.636]  Why do you think they're not talking about it?
[00:31:33.316 --> 00:31:34.857]  Well, this information is devastating.
[00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:47.594]  And what you have to realize is this goes directly to document fraud and a fraudulent document being offered to the American people during an election cycle as evidence that I am good to go, you can vote for me.
[00:31:47.734 --> 00:31:48.995]  It's a federal offense, am I right?
[00:31:49.475 --> 00:31:52.216]  Oh my God, there's numerous federal offenses under Title 18.
[00:31:52.697 --> 00:31:55.078]  Somebody's looking at 40 years, somewhere along the line.
[00:31:55.218 --> 00:31:57.058]  You're not going to be able to refute this document.
[00:31:57.619 --> 00:31:58.139]  It's a fraud.
[00:32:00.188 --> 00:32:03.649]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:07.150]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:12.012]  What should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the Fed and a president of the United States?
[00:32:12.152 --> 00:32:14.933]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:32:15.033 --> 00:32:20.975]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take.
[00:32:21.195 --> 00:32:24.778]  They print our money and then loan it to us at interest.
[00:32:25.219 --> 00:32:27.801]  The IRS is their collection agency.
[00:32:27.901 --> 00:32:36.429]  So long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else
[00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:46.213]  is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:32:46.313 --> 00:32:51.455]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:32:51.955 --> 00:32:55.816]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:32:55.836 --> 00:32:57.757]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:32:57.837 --> 00:32:58.817]  Is it one world?
[00:32:58.857 --> 00:33:00.258]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:33:02.264 --> 00:33:03.586]  Wars are not cheap.
[00:33:04.207 --> 00:33:07.914]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:11.591]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:13.133]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:14.594]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:22.040]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.784]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[00:33:27.364 --> 00:33:36.432]  That's why on major third-party sites, we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[00:33:37.383 --> 00:33:49.015]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically, and try to free this republic and the world.
[00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:50.997]  We apply to the problems we bring.
[00:33:52.042 --> 00:33:58.425]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:03.368]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[00:34:03.388 --> 00:34:04.668]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:07.150]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've...
[00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.090]  I think so.
[00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:27.006]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[00:34:27.426 --> 00:34:28.386]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[00:34:28.406 --> 00:34:30.707]  I dedicated myself to working out and I was in great shape.
[00:34:30.727 --> 00:34:31.788]  I've been dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:36.950]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.691]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:41.332]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:46.275]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:34:46.855 --> 00:34:56.664]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:57.485]  170-plus studies.
[00:34:57.505 --> 00:34:58.486]  We can make claims on this.
[00:34:58.526 --> 00:34:59.146]  This thing is like...
[00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:00.605]  We're good to go.
[00:35:21.698 --> 00:35:26.442]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.

[00:37:07.884 --> 00:37:21.489]  When I start to talk about just how important the times we live in are, I tend to get, well quite frankly, energized.
[00:37:23.422 --> 00:37:24.403]  Borderline hysterical.
[00:37:25.783 --> 00:37:32.646]  But I'd rather be too excited than too little in times like this.
[00:37:34.667 --> 00:37:36.829]  I look at the public living in a lamp of luxury.
[00:37:38.149 --> 00:37:40.890]  Even our poorest Americans live better than most poor people in the world.
[00:37:42.571 --> 00:37:47.934]  And I think about how we become fat and happy to a great extent.
[00:37:49.301 --> 00:37:50.202]  Nobody denies that.
[00:37:50.982 --> 00:37:51.903]  All the numbers show it.
[00:37:52.884 --> 00:37:54.905]  But more importantly, we've become culturally lazy.
[00:37:56.086 --> 00:38:00.550]  Where those of us that still at least appreciate things don't stand up enough.
[00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:03.732]  And that's what the whole globalist system is about.
[00:38:04.913 --> 00:38:08.056]  It's bullying us into submission.
[00:38:09.117 --> 00:38:17.403]  And we have become conscious of that and not let the gravity of their oppression drive us into acquiescence or submission.
[00:38:18.581 --> 00:38:22.763]  But let it drive us into political action.
[00:38:23.823 --> 00:38:27.065]  We shouldn't bully them back, but we should be very aggressive when they start it.
[00:38:28.385 --> 00:38:35.408]  And put them back in their servile, backstabbing, weaselly place that they've chosen for themselves.
[00:38:37.229 --> 00:38:40.510]  Everything they do is about social engineering.
[00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.672]  You know, I liken it to this restaurant I'm sitting in.
[00:38:45.106 --> 00:38:45.987]  I've never seen this before.
[00:38:47.008 --> 00:38:52.672]  It has little lasers to keep the birds that are outside, when you're eating outside, from flying and landing on your table.
[00:38:53.612 --> 00:38:56.334]  And every 10 seconds or so, the lasers fire down on your table.
[00:38:57.555 --> 00:38:58.636]  They actually hit you in the face.
[00:38:59.076 --> 00:38:59.757]  They're low-powered.
[00:39:02.038 --> 00:39:03.539]  And then the birds are afraid to land.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.981]  The sparrows.
[00:39:09.183 --> 00:39:09.844]  Now think about that.
[00:39:10.444 --> 00:39:10.885]  There's also
[00:39:12.887 --> 00:39:14.768]  Artificial owls that everyone's seen.
[00:39:16.369 --> 00:39:20.592]  But I guess those don't work anymore, so now they've got, now they've got green lasers.
[00:39:22.494 --> 00:39:25.896]  And I guess white lasers firing at every table out here on this balcony.
[00:39:27.637 --> 00:39:28.438]  At this restaurant.
[00:39:30.539 --> 00:39:32.161]  And it made me think of the social conditioning.
[00:39:32.181 --> 00:39:36.063]  You know, calling you racist if you're against Obamacare because you actually read the bill.
[00:39:36.944 --> 00:39:39.546]  The social engineers know that's like a big plastic owl.
[00:39:40.762 --> 00:39:45.245]  They just put out to scare you away from the political system.
[00:39:46.046 --> 00:39:48.528]  So liken this outdoor restaurant to the political scene.
[00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:51.090]  Well they just don't want us on it.
[00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:52.731]  They just want us to submit and go away.
[00:39:53.211 --> 00:39:57.735]  And let them basically occupy the scene and totally control it and dictate the future.
[00:39:59.836 --> 00:40:07.242]  But when the owls don't work, when the big plastic owls don't scare us off anymore, calling us racist, well now they just call us Russian spies.
[00:40:08.689 --> 00:40:10.911]  I gotta say, that is kind of unheard of, isn't it?
[00:40:11.271 --> 00:40:15.695]  Almost like green lasers at an outdoor restaurant to keep birds away.
[00:40:15.735 --> 00:40:16.636]  What's it going to take next?
[00:40:17.836 --> 00:40:22.720]  We're racists, we're homophobes, we're Russian agents.
[00:40:23.701 --> 00:40:25.543]  We work for the foreign powers.
[00:40:27.544 --> 00:40:35.331]  All over the world, from Germany to England to you name it, they're saying that countries are pulling out of the Euro because of the Russians.
[00:40:38.101 --> 00:40:44.506]  Meanwhile, I think about how we have brought Muslims into the country.
[00:40:44.526 --> 00:40:46.368]  Who, I love them.
[00:40:46.688 --> 00:40:47.549]  I mean, they're people too.
[00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:48.810]  I really do.
[00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:55.816]  I'm so sad that they're in a lot of, you know, extreme religious orthodoxy that's been used as a political tool, political Islam.
[00:40:57.077 --> 00:40:57.998]  And I fought against wars.
[00:40:59.315 --> 00:41:06.079]  They were needless and, you know, invading areas because we were invading non-radical Islamic countries to destabilize them.
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.380]  I knew it was part of a larger globalist plan.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:12.864]  I understand it's the global engineers that are actually puppeteering Islam right now, but it doesn't matter.
[00:41:12.984 --> 00:41:16.947]  Islam's a clear and present danger being brought in because it is incompatible.
[00:41:18.508 --> 00:41:26.313]  And so they want to scare us away from our liberties and our freedoms and say we can't be an open society because, oh, we brought something into your midst that's incompatible.
[00:41:27.822 --> 00:41:29.203]  So, they're trying a lot of different things.
[00:41:30.763 --> 00:41:33.964]  You know, some businesses hang out big bags of clear water.
[00:41:34.524 --> 00:41:36.125]  Plastic bags that scare off flies.
[00:41:37.085 --> 00:41:37.865]  Supposedly it works.
[00:41:38.906 --> 00:41:42.207]  Other people, you know, have plastic owls or hawks that scare away birds.
[00:41:43.287 --> 00:41:44.348]  As they see a prey bird.
[00:41:45.508 --> 00:41:46.869]  Or now lasers, I learned today.
[00:41:48.909 --> 00:41:51.910]  But I did hear that memo I filed earlier on the show today.
[00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.831]  And it was powerful information I covered.
[00:41:54.491 --> 00:41:56.552]  But I did start hyperventilating a little bit because
[00:41:59.048 --> 00:42:05.133]  It is such a big win that Chrysler's announcing they're moving billions of dollars of factories back after decades of leaving.
[00:42:06.634 --> 00:42:08.755]  And it's a big deal to hear Toyota's moving more stuff to the U.S.
[00:42:08.835 --> 00:42:14.800]  And it's a big deal to hear Ford's moving stuff to Kentucky out of Mexico and carrier from Mexico.
[00:42:15.552 --> 00:42:20.716]  Nothing against Mexico, it's just that they've been getting 20 plus factories for every factory we get, you know?
[00:42:21.456 --> 00:42:29.181]  We're gonna start having some fair tariffs so that if countries have artificial economic systems that are artificial tariffs, we're gonna add something in.
[00:42:29.702 --> 00:42:32.323]  You know, so maybe every 10 factories you get, we get one.
[00:42:32.364 --> 00:42:32.904]  How about that?
[00:42:33.504 --> 00:42:34.285]  Just the idea that
[00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:37.771]  We're not going to listen to the lies of free trade anymore.
[00:42:37.791 --> 00:42:38.591]  This is not free trade.
[00:42:38.651 --> 00:42:39.452]  It's not fair trade.
[00:42:39.492 --> 00:42:43.754]  It's one-sided crony systems and Hollywood's collapsing.
[00:42:43.794 --> 00:42:44.975]  Old Hollywood's falling apart.
[00:42:45.775 --> 00:42:49.697]  Sure, the communist Chinese are coming in and buying it up because it's cheap.
[00:42:49.737 --> 00:42:50.417]  It's worthless.
[00:42:51.958 --> 00:42:55.800]  It's more of a production house for their own domestic audience and they admit that.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:03.064]  And then there'll be new Hollywood's that are already being set up in Canada and places like Texas.
[00:43:04.116 --> 00:43:10.041]  And New Zealand that will fill the void of there not being produced any original independent content.
[00:43:10.081 --> 00:43:10.682]  It's already happened.
[00:43:11.042 --> 00:43:12.043]  And of course will fill the void.
[00:43:12.063 --> 00:43:13.764]  The American people and others.
[00:43:15.506 --> 00:43:17.788]  Folks that aren't run by centralized combines.
[00:43:18.748 --> 00:43:20.150]  The enemy can never compete with that.
[00:43:21.411 --> 00:43:23.012]  There is such positive news right now.
[00:43:24.974 --> 00:43:26.415]  I mean I just keep going back to the fact that
[00:43:28.214 --> 00:43:29.475]  It's the best of times, worst of times.
[00:43:29.876 --> 00:43:30.776]  They're coming after Trump.
[00:43:30.796 --> 00:43:31.577]  They're trying to block him.
[00:43:31.617 --> 00:43:38.663]  But it's a losing battle because Trump is only surfing the wave of nationalism and global awakening to tyranny.
[00:43:40.304 --> 00:43:42.066]  But I did want to just add issues about Islam.
[00:43:42.767 --> 00:43:44.208]  Another truck attack in Israel.
[00:43:44.308 --> 00:43:45.529]  A truck attack last week.
[00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:48.371]  A few weeks ago in Europe.
[00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:49.292]  In Germany.
[00:43:50.613 --> 00:43:51.694]  More mass shootings.
[00:43:53.135 --> 00:43:54.216]  More stabbings.
[00:43:54.397 --> 00:43:55.878]  I mean, it's happening all the time.
[00:43:57.401 --> 00:44:01.184]  We saw the mass shooting with the Islamists in Florida.
[00:44:01.224 --> 00:44:06.427]  Then we saw it again in Israel.
[00:44:06.487 --> 00:44:07.408]  It just goes on and on.
[00:44:08.289 --> 00:44:09.029]  What are you going to do?
[00:44:09.049 --> 00:44:09.750]  Ban trucks now?
[00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.551]  Just like you want to ban guns if somebody uses them?
[00:44:11.891 --> 00:44:14.593]  Well, actually, Germany's saying they're looking at putting in all trucks now.
[00:44:15.474 --> 00:44:16.915]  Remote control computer systems.
[00:44:17.535 --> 00:44:18.616]  Oh, magically, see?
[00:44:19.036 --> 00:44:21.018]  So everybody has their rights taken away.
[00:44:21.038 --> 00:44:24.120]  And so they're one step closer to driverless cars being law.
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.922]  Because, again, they brought in an incompatible group.
[00:44:28.137 --> 00:44:34.221]  That culturally are so elitist in their minds that they feel like everybody else should submit to them the opposite of tolerance.
[00:44:34.661 --> 00:44:43.526]  And then we're so tolerant and have such a self-loathing and such a self-hate for ourselves, really a cowardice almost, that we roll over to it.
[00:44:43.566 --> 00:44:44.127]  Well, not anymore.
[00:44:45.276 --> 00:44:58.250]  The West is open to innovation and to free ideas and people to treat with respect, but not to people that are having to leave their own countries in droves from Africa, Asia, the Middle East, because they can't get along with each other and can't build a civilization.
[00:44:59.421 --> 00:45:02.882]  So I'm very proud to stand up against the authoritarianism of Islam.
[00:45:03.702 --> 00:45:08.743]  I'm very proud to stand up against the authoritarianism of the globalists who are above it all.
[00:45:09.743 --> 00:45:27.806]  And until America and the West grows up and stands up against tyrants, and stops capitulating to corporatists, and the Islamist system they use as a sword of control, and the left that uses their brainwashing system at the colleges and schools, until we say no to this and pull out of this fraud, and until we turn the tide, things are only going to get worse.
[00:45:29.352 --> 00:45:31.895]  But everywhere, people are waking up and seeking political correctness.
[00:45:33.416 --> 00:45:35.919]  And as I've said a thousand times, humanity is coming back up for air.
[00:45:35.939 --> 00:45:38.982]  I want to thank you all of every race, color, and creed for your support.
[00:45:39.042 --> 00:45:51.896]  I don't care if you're a Muslim and you love freedom, and you realize that your religion needs a referendum, needs a reformation, needs a serious reform.
[00:45:54.070 --> 00:46:00.832]  I know there's been some golden times in Islam, and I understand the people of the Middle East, where he came from, invented a lot of the technologies we have, are actually really smart people.
[00:46:01.452 --> 00:46:02.873]  But you're under a cult's control.
[00:46:03.913 --> 00:46:11.876]  Whether it's Jim Jones cults, or other cults we can all think of, it's time for the people that are autocratically controlling those systems to be defeated.
[00:46:14.011 --> 00:46:18.558]  So, with human solidarity for all, I'm Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com.
[00:46:19.119 --> 00:46:24.527]  Again, reporting from the very front lines of the battle for human liberty and the re-emergence of the 21st century renaissance.
[00:46:32.782 --> 00:46:34.343]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:36.044]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:46:36.545 --> 00:46:36.745]  Okay?
[00:46:37.065 --> 00:46:39.927]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:46:40.107 --> 00:46:41.808]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:46:41.848 --> 00:46:43.129]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:46:43.489 --> 00:46:44.190]  This is Texas.
[00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:45.231]  You want to threaten me?
[00:46:45.291 --> 00:46:46.411]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:46:46.451 --> 00:46:47.072]  You understand that?
[00:46:47.232 --> 00:46:52.976]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:46:53.436 --> 00:46:57.259]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:49:04.437 --> 00:49:06.178]  Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:49:06.318 --> 00:49:08.538]  I'm joined by Conchita Sarnov.
[00:49:08.658 --> 00:49:16.321]  She is the CEO of the Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking and we are going to discuss some California legislation.
[00:49:16.521 --> 00:49:17.461]  Senate Bill number 1322.
[00:49:19.542 --> 00:49:25.750]  Well, Conchita, when I first read this bill, when I first saw this legislation and the story, I didn't even believe it.
[00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:27.272]  Honestly, I did not even believe it.
[00:49:27.372 --> 00:49:32.919]  I had to go and read it for myself, and I really still almost don't believe it, but there it is.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.383]  What was your first reaction when you saw this legislation?
[00:49:36.118 --> 00:49:38.460]  Well, I think it was very similar to yours.
[00:49:39.821 --> 00:49:42.582]  One was a complete state of disbelief.
[00:49:43.103 --> 00:49:45.424]  Number two, great concern.
[00:49:45.845 --> 00:50:03.417]  As you know, I've been managing an organization in D.C., Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and we have been attempting for the past two, three years to raise awareness of the issue of human trafficking and to help prevent children
[00:50:04.237 --> 00:50:10.120]  From being trafficked and those who are trafficked to help them receive services and support.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.121]  1 of our primary goals, of course.
[00:50:12.741 --> 00:50:21.745]  Oh, and is to open a safe house in DC and once that model is established and successful, hopefully open other safe houses across the country.
[00:50:22.305 --> 00:50:30.132]  So, when I read the legislation and it was sent to me by someone in the field of human trafficking, I was quite surprised.
[00:50:30.913 --> 00:50:47.287]  First, because our primary concern, not only our organization, but I guess every NGO's primary concern in the field of human trafficking is to prevent predators from trafficking children.
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:51:00.928]  to allow law enforcement and to help law enforcement and work with law enforcement in order to stop predators from trafficking children, selling them for sex on the streets and online.
[00:51:01.369 --> 00:51:10.295]  So, if you read the bill, which I did, it's a rather lengthy bill and it was signed into effect on September 26, 2016.
[00:51:10.355 --> 00:51:10.635]  It's SB 1322.
[00:51:16.079 --> 00:51:21.222]  And unfortunately, it has, I believe, unintended consequences.
[00:51:21.863 --> 00:51:31.648]  I'm sure that unwittingly, those who attempted and who advocated for the bill, I don't believe, were there to hurt the victims.
[00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:38.512]  But unfortunately, according to the DA's office, and I cannot
[00:51:39.993 --> 00:51:50.841]  Reveal who I spoke to at the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, but the officials who I spoke to said that this law actually does not protect victims.
[00:51:51.161 --> 00:51:51.641]  Why?
[00:51:52.001 --> 00:51:58.306]  Very simply because it allows the victim to claim
[00:51:59.491 --> 00:52:15.542]  Who writes when she's on or he is on the street, boys and girls underage can now claim under SB 1322 that the police who comes forward to try to detain that victim cannot detain them
[00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:18.611]  And they're infringing upon their rights.
[00:52:19.511 --> 00:52:45.499]  So, that is something that we need, I think, if law enforcement and the District Attorney's Office of Los Angeles is calling this bill a negative bill, something that will hurt victims instead of help victims, I think we need to pay attention to the District Attorney's Office and to those other law enforcement officials who are claiming the same concerns
[00:52:46.219 --> 00:52:54.344]  And we need to either amend the bill, which you know is a process, it's a long process, so we can't simply just amend the bill within 24 hours.
[00:52:54.424 --> 00:52:56.906]  It's going to take at least a year or so.
[00:52:58.247 --> 00:53:00.288]  And we've got to overturn this bill.
[00:53:01.529 --> 00:53:02.610]  That's the solution.
[00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:13.116]  But the primary solution, as all of us who work in the field of human trafficking understand, are based on three pillars.
[00:53:13.476 --> 00:53:14.077]  Prevention,
[00:53:14.815 --> 00:53:17.096]  Protection and prosecution.
[00:53:17.957 --> 00:53:35.208]  So if a policeman is not allowed to detain a victim while on the street because of SB 1322, he is actually not doing the victim any favors because the victim can be helped through child services once it's detained.
[00:53:35.768 --> 00:53:41.491]  Not to be prosecuted for a criminal act because if that child is a minor, then
[00:53:42.939 --> 00:53:53.489]  Absolutely, that child cannot be detained as a prostitute, but it can be detained until that predator goes away or is somehow put away.
[00:53:54.209 --> 00:53:59.134]  Under this bill, it makes it much more difficult for that predator to go away.
[00:54:00.094 --> 00:54:24.275]  Well I'm somebody who loves to pontificate on the philosophy of our law and order and when I first read this I say okay why would they pass this and of course the logic is we're trying to protect the victim as you said I would imagine so they don't have a legal record built up or so that they can avoid you know stuff like that just all the stuff that comes with a legal record dealing with the police however
[00:54:24.955 --> 00:54:40.087]  I believe that this is skirting the judicial process because my philosophy of law and order is if there's a situation where let's say an underage or a minor is being sex trafficked, well then I put the onus on that judge
[00:54:40.427 --> 00:54:42.388]  To see the case and say, you know what?
[00:54:42.548 --> 00:54:43.688]  This is a victim here.
[00:54:43.948 --> 00:54:45.628]  This person doesn't need a legal record.
[00:54:45.928 --> 00:54:57.292]  But now, thanks to this legislation, they've, as you said, opened the door for essentially child prostitution to go on on the streets and taken the law out of the process here.
[00:54:57.532 --> 00:54:58.492]  So now they can just do it.
[00:54:58.532 --> 00:55:01.693]  And like you said, they have the right to essentially say, hey, you can't arrest me.
[00:55:02.013 --> 00:55:02.773]  I'm allowed to do this.
[00:55:03.093 --> 00:55:06.114]  Don't you think that this opens the door for predators to take advantage of it as well?
[00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:07.470]  Absolutely.
[00:55:07.650 --> 00:55:33.300]  Not only does it allow predators to take advantage of this, which is what the DA's office explained to me, and you know, I am not a lawyer, so I certainly pay attention to and listen to attorneys and district attorneys who have recommended that this law is not positive and not helpful and not a preventive measure
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:34.540]  All right.
[00:55:45.632 --> 00:55:59.403]  A child under the age of 14 year old child today can actually be allowed to have sexual relations with an adult and that adult will not go to jail.
[00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:01.844]  Now you have to ask yourself why?
[00:56:02.105 --> 00:56:14.054]  Well, very simply, from what I was told in Peru, there were so many government officials and rich predators abusing children sexually under the age
[00:56:14.634 --> 00:56:17.196]  That they decided to create this new law.
[00:56:17.777 --> 00:56:31.688]  So you wonder why in California, you know, a community, a state that is quite liberal sexually, and why would they pass this law?
[00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:33.809]  It is a question.
[00:56:33.869 --> 00:56:36.391]  It is an important question we need to ask ourselves.
[00:56:36.571 --> 00:56:40.615]  And at the end of the day, this is a bipartisan issue.
[00:56:40.655 --> 00:56:43.477]  This is not about Democrats versus Republicans.
[00:56:44.495 --> 00:56:47.037]  This is not about liberals versus conservatives.
[00:56:47.417 --> 00:57:03.810]  This is about laws that we need to have in place that allow law enforcement to prosecute traffickers, protect victims, and prevent these types of crimes from happening to our children.
[00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:05.371]  That's what this is about.
[00:57:05.771 --> 00:57:08.013]  And that should be everyone's focus.
[00:57:08.453 --> 00:57:15.479]  Well, I'm afraid the liberal mindset has really twisted and concocted quite a web here that they're not even going to be able to get themselves out of.
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:16.941]  But it's been interesting.
[00:57:17.021 --> 00:57:27.030]  Recently, I've noticed the normalization of pedophilia with publications such as Salon, the New York Times, TV shows on Fox putting children with gags in their mouth.
[00:57:27.370 --> 00:57:31.614]  Even on Snapchat, they stood up for a pedophile who said he was a professor.
[00:57:31.994 --> 00:57:32.174]  That's
[00:57:48.803 --> 00:57:54.427]  I don't want to speak out of turn, but I do know that we live in a hyper-sexual culture.
[00:57:54.447 --> 00:58:07.177]  I have heard many stories, I have read many stories about Hollywood children, so to speak, you know, entertainers, young, underage Hollywood
[00:58:07.837 --> 00:58:18.405]  Kids, entertainers, who have been sexually abused by directors, producers, etc., people in the industry, and you know, that has happened since time immemorial.
[00:58:18.965 --> 00:58:34.116]  So, I would guess, and this is a guesstimate, that given the stories I've read and the information that's out there, yes, it could be a law that would certainly help
[00:58:36.994 --> 00:58:41.837]  Those predators get away with more than what they've already been able to get away with.
[00:58:42.417 --> 00:58:47.299]  In this country, as you know, when you have money and you have influence, you can get away with a lot.
[00:58:47.479 --> 00:58:55.043]  And that was the basis of my book, Trafficking, which was published last year after many, many publishers turned it down.
[00:58:55.643 --> 00:59:02.587]  Well, Conchita Sarnoff from the Alliance to Rescue Victims of Human Trafficking, thank you so much for raising awareness of this and fighting the good fight.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.932]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.185]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
