[00:00:10.024 --> 00:00:14.809]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.531]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:18.192]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.192 --> 00:00:28.742]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:30.104]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:31.945]  It is Sunday, December the 10th, 2017.
[00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:32.646]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:33.996 --> 00:00:35.217]  I'm your host today.
[00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:37.458]  Usually you'll find me at 8 a.m.
[00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:45.784]  Monday through Friday, but today I'm here on the Sunday Show and we have an amazing sequence of events over the last couple of days.
[00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:57.192]  One of them you probably haven't heard of, but you have heard about the attacks by the Washington Post coming out with tweets trying to pretend that nobody showed up to hear President Trump at the rally that he had for Roy Moore.
[00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:03.770]  Then, as President Trump says, you're absolutely lying, showing this empty stadium.
[00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.152]  Here's what really happened.
[00:01:06.152 --> 00:01:14.259]  Then you have the journalists lining up to defend this Washington Post reporter who put out this fake attack piece.
[00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.783]  And then that followed CNN the previous day, coming after Donald Trump Jr.
[00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:21.625]  This is weaponized media, folks.
[00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:34.300]  But yesterday we had an attack against Owen Schroyer as he was covering a memorial service for Kate Steinle here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.903]  And a lot of antipop people showed up to try to shut that down.
[00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:37.984]  And they shut down Owen.
[00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:40.446]  And they didn't just shut him down.
[00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:44.490]  They committed very serious assault against him.
[00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.311]  And we're going to have a clip of that.
[00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:49.074]  When you talk about the laws, understand when you talk about assault and battery.
[00:01:50.293 --> 00:01:54.757]  Assault is threatening somebody, and being able to credibly do that.
[00:01:54.757 --> 00:02:01.862]  And these people had masks on, they had weapons, they had shields, and one of them at least was carrying a gun.
[00:02:01.862 --> 00:02:06.286]  When you're carrying a gun, wearing a mask, and brandishing the gun, that's the official
[00:02:07.847 --> 00:02:19.315]  The legal term for that, when you're carrying a gun and using and threatening somebody, either with the gun by the way that you're holding it or threatening them as you're holding a gun, that's called brandishing a weapon.
[00:02:19.315 --> 00:02:21.577]  That's called assault.
[00:02:21.577 --> 00:02:27.521]  And so tomorrow, Owen Shroyer is going to file a criminal complaint because the police didn't do anything about that.
[00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:29.182]  They let them mace other people.
[00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:30.603]  They got together in a big group.
[00:02:30.603 --> 00:02:32.785]  I mean, at one respect, it looked like
[00:02:33.832 --> 00:02:37.774]  A LARPers convention, because that's the way the Antifa people are.
[00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:39.915]  But it was a very serious assault.
[00:02:39.915 --> 00:02:41.976]  These people were threatening violence.
[00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:48.099]  They were shoving him, hitting him in the back with a stick as he was trying to just get to the rally, the people who were at the rally.
[00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.320]  For Kate Steinle, remember that?
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:03:00.885]  The illegal immigrant who had been transported, it was either five or six times, I think he was either, he was about to be deported for the sixth or seventh time, when he said he just found a gun.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.262]  That was laying on the bench and the gun just went off just like in the movies.
[00:03:05.262 --> 00:03:07.103]  He had nothing to do with it.
[00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.363]  It wasn't premeditated murder.
[00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:10.204]  It wasn't even manslaughter.
[00:03:10.204 --> 00:03:11.185]  The gun did it.
[00:03:11.185 --> 00:03:12.825]  The gun did it.
[00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:16.567]  And so still no justice for Kate Steinle.
[00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:18.468]  And that's what we're seeing over and over again.
[00:03:18.468 --> 00:03:24.171]  And no protection of anybody who isn't politically correct.
[00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:27.833]  There is no protection for people who are using weapons against the media.
[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.604]  And certainly no concern about that by our weaponized media, who comes after conservatives, who come after President Trump.
[00:03:35.604 --> 00:03:38.645]  We're also going to give you some updates on some other stories in the news.
[00:03:38.645 --> 00:03:41.787]  Roger Stone will be joining us to talk about what's going on.
[00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:49.111]  Michael Flynn and also Tom Arnold and other issues that have surfaced, many things coming out in the last couple of days.
[00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:52.833]  We have the Pentagon is now saying they're going to have their first ever audit.
[00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:57.315]  Well, maybe it's about time, because there's several trillion dollars missing.
[00:03:57.315 --> 00:04:00.637]  They even have 44,000 troops missing.
[00:04:00.637 --> 00:04:02.718]  How in the world do you do that?
[00:04:02.718 --> 00:04:05.900]  They don't even know where their troops are.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.662]  They're not saying that it's classified, that they can't tell you.
[00:04:08.662 --> 00:04:10.943]  They're saying their destination is unknown.
[00:04:10.943 --> 00:04:13.865]  And this is coming out of Stars and Stripes magazine.
[00:04:13.865 --> 00:04:15.826]  People in the conservative media have just picked this up.
[00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:17.587]  This is how big the U.S.
[00:04:17.587 --> 00:04:18.388]  empire has grown.
[00:04:19.403 --> 00:04:21.866]  America has lost track of the number of wars that we're fighting.
[00:04:21.866 --> 00:04:24.790]  We've lost track of our soldiers just all over the place.
[00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.754]  I mean, this is the insanity that we're looking at here.
[00:04:27.754 --> 00:04:32.079]  Is there some way that we can ever get back to a constitutional government?
[00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:36.545]  Is there some way that we'll audit the Pentagon or maybe even the politicians in Washington, D.C.? ?
[00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:39.387]  Maybe I don't think that it's going to happen.
[00:04:39.387 --> 00:04:45.031]  I think maybe instead of auditing the Fed we may be able to transcend it with cryptocurrencies.
[00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:48.473]  Is it given that other countries are going to transcend the petrodollar?
[00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:50.534]  That's the only question is what's going to happen with that.
[00:04:50.534 --> 00:04:50.934]  Stay with us.
[00:04:50.934 --> 00:04:51.414]  Be right back.
[00:04:51.414 --> 00:04:58.658]  I'm David Knight.
[00:04:58.658 --> 00:04:59.519]  Mike in Arizona.
[00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:00.580]  You're on the air worldwide.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.860]  Go ahead.
[00:05:01.804 --> 00:05:03.726]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:05:03.726 --> 00:05:14.255]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:05:14.255 --> 00:05:17.618]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:05:18.078 --> 00:05:18.338]  Absolutely.
[00:05:40.828 --> 00:05:53.745]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.180]  We've got it.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.222]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:07.222 --> 00:06:11.604]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:17.186]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:24.213 --> 00:06:25.514]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:25.514 --> 00:06:29.258]  I'm David Knight on this December the 10th, 2017.
[00:06:29.258 --> 00:06:31.220]  Yesterday was a pretty amazing event.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:38.747]  There was a rally in support of Kate Steinle to draw attention to that travesty that happened in San Francisco.
[00:06:39.508 --> 00:06:52.232]  The Sanctuary City has now given sanctuary to the murderer, saying he had absolutely nothing to do with her death, even though there was a loaded gun that was stolen out of the seat of a BLM officer's car.
[00:06:52.232 --> 00:06:59.514]  Somehow that just went off close to this individual who was about to be deported for either the sixth or the seventh time, kept coming in.
[00:06:59.514 --> 00:07:04.896]  He'd have been convicted of multiple felonies, but he said that the gun just went off on his own, just like in the movies.
[00:07:04.896 --> 00:07:06.136]  He had absolutely nothing to do with it.
[00:07:06.136 --> 00:07:08.877]  You know, he just set these things down, and they're so dangerous,
[00:07:09.457 --> 00:07:13.239]  That the liberals think that they go off without anybody even touching them.
[00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:15.901]  And so they didn't even convict him of manslaughter.
[00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:20.304]  They just convicted him of having possession of a firearm when he wasn't supposed to have it.
[00:07:20.304 --> 00:07:31.090]  But when you look at this event yesterday, Owen Schroeder went to report on this here in Austin, and look at these LARPer idiots, who are very violent, quite frankly.
[00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.671]  They were very intimidating.
[00:07:32.671 --> 00:07:35.513]  They were pushing and shoving him as he was trying to get by.
[00:07:35.513 --> 00:07:36.974]  They would get one side or the other.
[00:07:37.634 --> 00:07:58.924]  I mean, at one level, if it wasn't for the violence that we know that they're capable of, and if it wasn't for the fact that they are threatening him with one of the individuals not having just sticks and shields and helmets and masks, but also one of the group had, at least one of the group had a rifle that he was brandishing, and I'm using that in the legal sense.
[00:07:58.924 --> 00:08:00.025]  When you have a weapon,
[00:08:00.945 --> 00:08:07.948]  And you are displaying it, or using it, or holding that weapon as you are making threats against people, as they were against Owen.
[00:08:07.948 --> 00:08:10.249]  That is called brandishing a weapon.
[00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:21.633]  And it also is called assault, when you're making credible threats against somebody, whether it is with a stick with a nail in the end of it, or even if it's just a stick.
[00:08:22.782 --> 00:08:23.482]  And a group of people.
[00:08:23.482 --> 00:08:24.423]  He was surrounded by people.
[00:08:24.423 --> 00:08:27.384]  There were people in the back of him that you don't see in that video.
[00:08:27.384 --> 00:08:31.686]  So let's play some of this video and I'll narrate it for the people who are listening on the radio.
[00:08:31.686 --> 00:08:38.889]  This is Owen Schroer yesterday at a memorial in recognition of Kate Steinle in Austin, Texas.
[00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:43.231]  And the people who showed up in force were Antifa Marxists.
[00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:47.934]  You can see some of them wearing masks that have a hammer and sickle on it.
[00:08:47.934 --> 00:08:48.574]  So here's that video.
[00:08:49.548 --> 00:08:51.749]  Owens Royer here for InfoWars.com.
[00:08:51.749 --> 00:08:55.210]  I am in downtown Austin, Texas.
[00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:04.452]  I am about to walk into Wooldridge Square here, where you have a Kate Steinle March happening that has been invaded.
[00:09:04.452 --> 00:09:06.093]  How are you guys doing?
[00:09:06.093 --> 00:09:06.833]  InfoWars.
[00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:08.274]  I thought you'd say something like that.
[00:09:08.274 --> 00:09:11.815]  After all, we're trying to honor a dead person here.
[00:09:11.815 --> 00:09:18.937]  But that didn't stop protesters from showing up with megaphones and shouting obscenities.
[00:09:20.253 --> 00:09:21.654]  Hey, how you doing, man?
[00:09:21.654 --> 00:09:23.716]  Hey, what are you guys doing out here today?
[00:09:23.716 --> 00:09:25.918]  He's not saying anything, just staring at me.
[00:09:25.918 --> 00:09:26.839]  What are you guys doing out here today?
[00:09:26.839 --> 00:09:33.504]  If you want to know how Kate Steinle, uh, killer, got off with a jury, it's people like this that we have here in Austin.
[00:09:33.504 --> 00:09:36.226]  It's basically an adjunct of San Francisco.
[00:09:36.226 --> 00:09:37.788]  You're protesting Kate Steinle?
[00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:40.685]  Hey, what brought you out here today, sir?
[00:09:40.685 --> 00:09:42.686]  You know my name, so maybe he'll talk to me.
[00:09:42.686 --> 00:09:43.867]  I'm just trying to talk to you guys.
[00:09:43.867 --> 00:09:44.347]  What's up?
[00:09:44.347 --> 00:09:45.128]  I'm a person, too, you know.
[00:09:45.128 --> 00:09:49.910]  So now he's doing this thing where you, uh, this is very popular with the left, where they bump you.
[00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.732]  You know, you saw that with Shia LaBeouf bumping people.
[00:09:52.732 --> 00:09:54.513]  Excuse me, excuse me, doing that thing.
[00:09:54.513 --> 00:09:55.233]  They did it to Alex.
[00:09:55.233 --> 00:09:56.094]  They're doing it to Owen.
[00:09:56.094 --> 00:09:56.854]  They do it everywhere.
[00:09:58.407 --> 00:10:00.188]  Okay, so I guess we're both crackers.
[00:10:00.188 --> 00:10:01.849]  This is really strange.
[00:10:01.849 --> 00:10:06.252]  Yeah, no, we just smile and bang into you and say, excuse me.
[00:10:06.252 --> 00:10:07.673]  And it's not aggressive at all.
[00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:08.814]  Okay.
[00:10:08.814 --> 00:10:10.815]  Why are you guys so aggressive?
[00:10:10.815 --> 00:10:13.276]  Like, honestly, what is the big deal?
[00:10:13.276 --> 00:10:14.397]  Why are these guys wearing masks?
[00:10:14.397 --> 00:10:16.018]  You won't even talk to me.
[00:10:16.018 --> 00:10:17.759]  Like, why can't we talk?
[00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:22.802]  They've got shields, they've got sticks, and firearms.
[00:10:22.802 --> 00:10:23.523]  Masks.
[00:10:23.523 --> 00:10:25.864]  You would throw me out.
[00:10:25.864 --> 00:10:26.805]  You would beat my ass.
[00:10:27.859 --> 00:10:31.483]  If we were at a bar, you'd beat my ass.
[00:10:31.483 --> 00:10:39.671]  There's a guy with his hand on the trigger, standing right behind these guys looking at Owen, and he's got a mask with a hammer and sickle on it.
[00:10:39.671 --> 00:10:40.452]  Saying, are you afraid?
[00:10:40.452 --> 00:10:41.233]  You should be afraid.
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.661]  And it's not like wearing a Trump hat is a safe thing to do.
[00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:47.522]  Suddenly you're against the Second Amendment?
[00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:48.842]  When did I say that?
[00:10:48.842 --> 00:10:50.142]  Well, you're the one that's saying that.
[00:10:50.142 --> 00:10:53.123]  See, this is not exercising the Second Amendment.
[00:10:53.123 --> 00:10:54.924]  It is assault with a deadly weapon.
[00:10:54.924 --> 00:10:56.724]  It is brandishing a weapon.
[00:10:56.724 --> 00:10:57.665]  Those are felonies.
[00:10:57.665 --> 00:10:59.505]  So I'm literally surrounded by a bunch of guys.
[00:10:59.505 --> 00:11:04.827]  Compounded by the fact that they're wearing masks because they know that they're breaking the law, or about to, or want to.
[00:11:04.827 --> 00:11:06.927]  Oh my gosh, look at this guy, he's scared.
[00:11:06.927 --> 00:11:08.208]  Are you not trying to intimidate me?
[00:11:08.208 --> 00:11:09.308]  Is that not your purpose out here?
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.584]  So all I'm trying to do is to get to the Kate Steinle March.
[00:11:15.584 --> 00:11:21.448]  And as he tries to walk around them, they create a wall with their shields or sticks and their firearms.
[00:11:21.448 --> 00:11:25.332]  It's kind of like the Black Knight from Monty Python.
[00:11:25.332 --> 00:11:27.473]  None shall pass.
[00:11:27.473 --> 00:11:30.376]  And aggressive like he was as well.
[00:11:30.376 --> 00:11:32.317]  Somebody needs to cut them down to size.
[00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.900]  You all are adults!
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.201]  You're behaving like children!
[00:11:37.003 --> 00:11:37.483]  You know that?
[00:11:37.483 --> 00:11:39.045]  You're behaving like children.
[00:11:39.045 --> 00:11:40.346]  Yeah, gay frogs, right.
[00:11:40.346 --> 00:11:44.910]  Atrazine, why don't you read a study before you come out here and cover your face?
[00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.050]  What are you doing, dude?
[00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:46.891]  Aren't you a journalist?
[00:11:46.891 --> 00:11:48.853]  Now you're blocking my right to free speech?
[00:11:48.853 --> 00:11:56.319]  Yeah, kind of like the Washington Post, Twitter, Facebook, all those, yeah, they don't... No free speech for other people.
[00:11:56.319 --> 00:12:00.022]  They encourage weaponized people using weapons against the media.
[00:12:01.348 --> 00:12:06.309]  So do I literally have to go in here and then you guys have to assault me and get arrested by these guys?
[00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:08.089]  Is that what has to happen right here?
[00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:11.890]  Because you hate me so much even though you don't even know me or anything about me?
[00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.411]  And you cover your faces.
[00:12:13.411 --> 00:12:14.911]  Why do you cover your faces?
[00:12:14.911 --> 00:12:17.731]  At least this guy has enough courage to not have his face covered.
[00:12:17.731 --> 00:12:21.852]  Why won't you guys uncover your face?
[00:12:21.852 --> 00:12:24.393]  So are these guys not peaceful then?
[00:12:24.393 --> 00:12:25.593]  Yeah, don't talk to me.
[00:12:25.593 --> 00:12:27.293]  So you're with the Peaceful Streets Project.
[00:12:27.293 --> 00:12:28.654]  That's why your face is uncovered.
[00:12:28.654 --> 00:12:29.754]  Why is there his face is covered?
[00:12:31.027 --> 00:12:32.668]  So they can punch you and get away with it.
[00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:33.629]  Alright, here I go.
[00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:34.129]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:34.770]  Here I go.
[00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:36.151]  Literally, they won't let me in here.
[00:12:36.151 --> 00:12:38.593]  This is obviously insane.
[00:12:38.593 --> 00:12:39.594]  Oh my God!
[00:12:41.412 --> 00:12:45.315]  I can't even... Oh, I feel like I'm in kindergarten right now!
[00:12:45.315 --> 00:12:49.898]  You know, the police were Johnny-on-the-spot whenever we were there.
[00:12:49.898 --> 00:13:01.365]  Whenever you got people who were protesting for the right to open carry, carrying a black powder rifle, which is legal by the way, open carry, and the police arrested those individuals.
[00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:09.671]  But they don't care if these guys, if guys with masks and firearms and sticks and shields are there, they don't care about that.
[00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:10.011]  Interesting.
[00:13:11.394 --> 00:13:12.515]  Nazi scum?
[00:13:12.515 --> 00:13:14.155]  Nazis are socialists just like you.
[00:13:14.155 --> 00:13:15.516]  How am I a Nazi scum?
[00:13:15.516 --> 00:13:17.457]  You are a Nazi scum!
[00:13:17.457 --> 00:13:18.277]  What just happened to you?
[00:13:18.277 --> 00:13:19.538]  I got maced.
[00:13:19.538 --> 00:13:20.178]  Who maced you?
[00:13:20.178 --> 00:13:21.399]  I don't know.
[00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:24.360]  She ran like she maced me and then she ran the other way.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:24.840]  Antifa?
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.041]  Was it Antifa?
[00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:27.681]  Yes.
[00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:32.824]  Hopefully some of these violent protesters are being arrested here.
[00:13:32.824 --> 00:13:34.604]  Alright.
[00:13:34.604 --> 00:13:35.805]  We're being protected out here.
[00:13:35.805 --> 00:13:38.066]  Antifa is getting out of control.
[00:13:38.066 --> 00:13:40.107]  Antifa is now getting totally out of control here.
[00:13:43.766 --> 00:13:48.128]  All right, so the police have shown up.
[00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:53.590]  They are walking their bicycles, which they also use kind of as shields in this particular kind of situation.
[00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.471]  They were beating people.
[00:13:54.471 --> 00:13:56.152]  Are you all right, sir?
[00:13:56.152 --> 00:13:57.072]  Yes.
[00:13:57.072 --> 00:13:58.233]  Did you see the mace people?
[00:13:58.233 --> 00:13:59.453]  I didn't see no mace.
[00:13:59.453 --> 00:14:00.033]  I didn't smell no mace.
[00:14:00.033 --> 00:14:00.954]  You saw the mace people?
[00:14:00.954 --> 00:14:04.296]  I saw the mace, Jim Lowe, and one chick just elbowed me in the chest.
[00:14:04.296 --> 00:14:04.856]  You got hit?
[00:14:04.856 --> 00:14:05.616]  You got elbowed?
[00:14:05.616 --> 00:14:06.557]  Yes, I did.
[00:14:06.557 --> 00:14:07.317]  You got maced too?
[00:14:07.317 --> 00:14:07.617]  Yes.
[00:14:07.617 --> 00:14:08.618]  She got elbowed in the chest.
[00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:10.798]  By the Antifa people.
[00:14:10.798 --> 00:14:12.639]  They're macing people, attacking.
[00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:19.641]  And you know, there's more of the Antifa people there than there are, I think, people who are there to honor Kate Steinle.
[00:14:19.641 --> 00:14:22.201]  And to draw attention to the miscarriage of justice there.
[00:14:22.201 --> 00:14:27.743]  I was trying to tell the man that was having a conversation with us that these people are violent and then it happened.
[00:14:27.743 --> 00:14:31.684]  So this is what we expected with these people.
[00:14:31.684 --> 00:14:38.926]  So this is one of the Antifa members who just got arrested and he's still telling people to F off.
[00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:41.700]  He's got an earpiece in.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.781]  I'm wondering why that guy has an earpiece in.
[00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:47.584]  This is an Antifa protester out here with an earpiece in.
[00:14:47.584 --> 00:14:48.504]  That's very strange.
[00:14:48.504 --> 00:14:51.606]  Alright, if you want to see that, we've got an article up at Infowars.com.
[00:14:51.606 --> 00:14:56.029]  Antifa violently protests memorial for woman killed by illegal alien.
[00:14:56.029 --> 00:15:05.015]  We also have the video that is unedited and the full video we have up on Alex Jones' channel.
[00:15:05.015 --> 00:15:06.836]  This is what we're seeing over and over again.
[00:15:06.836 --> 00:15:08.177]  And that is the attempt
[00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:10.462]  To intimidate people.
[00:15:10.462 --> 00:15:12.165]  The mainstream media doesn't care about that.
[00:15:12.165 --> 00:15:13.828]  We see... Here's an example of this.
[00:15:13.828 --> 00:15:17.795]  You know, we look at this white teen who was tortured.
[00:15:17.795 --> 00:15:19.919]  The guy who has an IQ of a four-year-old.
[00:15:20.765 --> 00:15:21.766]  And there were three black people.
[00:15:21.766 --> 00:15:23.067]  He's been let off.
[00:15:23.067 --> 00:15:25.648]  Kate Steinle's murderer has been let off.
[00:15:25.648 --> 00:15:27.990]  Not even charged with manslaughter.
[00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:29.591]  Just let off.
[00:15:29.591 --> 00:15:30.892]  That's what we see happening.
[00:15:30.892 --> 00:15:35.135]  The death threats against the FCC chairman over net neutrality?
[00:15:35.135 --> 00:15:36.335]  They just leave that up.
[00:15:36.335 --> 00:15:36.876]  No problem.
[00:15:36.876 --> 00:15:37.776]  They leave that up.
[00:15:37.776 --> 00:15:40.938]  Meanwhile, YouTube takes down Poland.
[00:15:40.938 --> 00:15:46.462]  The Polish government's video exposing the migrant invasion and say, this is bad policy.
[00:15:46.462 --> 00:15:47.363]  It's coming from the EU.
[00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:49.584]  We're not going to allow that to happen here in Poland.
[00:15:49.584 --> 00:15:50.205]  That's taken down.
[00:15:50.865 --> 00:15:51.846]  By YouTube.
[00:15:51.846 --> 00:15:53.887]  Essentially isolated in a purgatory.
[00:15:53.887 --> 00:15:56.830]  They left it up, but they told people, no no, you can't watch this content.
[00:15:58.874 --> 00:16:01.455]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[00:16:01.455 --> 00:16:16.064]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[00:16:16.064 --> 00:16:23.648]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[00:16:24.168 --> 00:16:35.315]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me, and it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[00:16:35.315 --> 00:16:41.458]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:43.820]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:51.566]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[00:16:51.566 --> 00:16:56.110]  That is the new shirt of the month, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:16:57.549 --> 00:16:59.510]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.831]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:02.032]  Why is this so good?
[00:17:02.032 --> 00:17:07.316]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:17:07.316 --> 00:17:20.866]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:17:20.866 --> 00:17:22.227]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:17:23.147 --> 00:17:27.230]  Spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:28.530]  These are all parasites.
[00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:29.651]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:17:29.651 --> 00:17:30.972]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:17:30.972 --> 00:17:35.474]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:17:35.474 --> 00:17:38.736]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:17:38.736 --> 00:17:41.818]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:17:41.818 --> 00:17:42.879]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:17:42.879 --> 00:17:44.780]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:45.821]  And folks, you can't lose.

[00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.451]  Woo!

[00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:35.176]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store.
[00:18:35.336 --> 00:18:37.217]  There is no comparison.
[00:18:37.217 --> 00:18:46.800]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[00:20:22.879 --> 00:20:27.720]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:34.642]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:34.642 --> 00:20:35.142]  Welcome back.
[00:20:35.142 --> 00:20:36.923]  I'm David Knight on this Sunday, December the 10th, 2017.
[00:20:36.923 --> 00:20:37.563]  We're gonna get back to...
[00:20:41.522 --> 00:20:52.145]  This event yesterday, it was a memorial service in honor of Kate Steinle to draw attention to the injustice that happened in San Francisco.
[00:20:52.145 --> 00:21:01.307]  But as you saw, if you're watching that last segment, you saw that the hateful violence of Antifa is not limited to California.
[00:21:01.307 --> 00:21:05.468]  We have quite a few people here in Austin that are just like that.
[00:21:05.468 --> 00:21:08.689]  But it's also a story of all across this country.
[00:21:09.315 --> 00:21:18.059]  We have the situation where the three black teens captured a young white teen and tortured him.
[00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:22.681]  He's got an IQ of a four-year-old, tortured him, and filmed it.
[00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:23.281]  They thought it was great.
[00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:25.182]  They put it up on social media.
[00:21:25.182 --> 00:21:34.065]  And the judge basically let them plead guilty to a hate crime, aggravated battery, and intimidation, but let them off without any prison time.
[00:21:34.065 --> 00:21:35.466]  They just get community service.
[00:21:35.466 --> 00:21:37.547]  He said, I'm not sure that you'd come out of prison any better.
[00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:38.327]  Well, that's not the point.
[00:21:39.588 --> 00:21:41.009]  There's a punishment element.
[00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:48.173]  There's a message that needs to be sent that we're not going to allow you to get away with no punishment.
[00:21:48.173 --> 00:21:49.554]  That's the message that he's sending.
[00:21:49.554 --> 00:21:56.198]  Certainly, they're not going to be any better and nobody else is going to be any better if they realize that they can take somebody with the IQ of a four-year-old, torture them,
[00:21:57.572 --> 00:21:59.633]  And pay no penalty for that.
[00:21:59.633 --> 00:22:02.215]  200 hours of community service, whatever that means.
[00:22:02.215 --> 00:22:07.698]  They dropped charges of kidnapping, which would have given them serious time, but basically give them a walk.
[00:22:07.698 --> 00:22:13.941]  Students, meanwhile, in a coffee shop at a university.
[00:22:13.941 --> 00:22:15.642]  This is in a Bronx campus.
[00:22:15.642 --> 00:22:19.644]  A social justice warrior got them booted out of Fordham University.
[00:22:19.644 --> 00:22:24.167]  They're in a coffee shop and they had the audacity to wear a Trump Make America Great Again hat.
[00:22:25.046 --> 00:22:28.289]  And so that violated their safe space policy.
[00:22:28.289 --> 00:22:30.070]  They were thrown out of the coffee shop.
[00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.611]  They said, we weren't even talking politics.
[00:22:31.611 --> 00:22:33.753]  We were talking about final exams.
[00:22:33.753 --> 00:22:35.555]  They said, get out five minutes, says the worker.
[00:22:35.555 --> 00:22:36.495]  I'm protecting our customers.
[00:22:36.495 --> 00:22:39.618]  You're wearing hats that completely violate the safe space policy.
[00:22:39.618 --> 00:22:41.559]  You have to go.
[00:22:41.559 --> 00:22:51.768]  That is the attitude and the training that results in what we just saw with these Antifa students in Austin attacking Owen Schroeder.
[00:22:53.365 --> 00:23:07.006]  Aggravated assault, brandishing a firearm, wearing masks while they were doing it, body blocking him, checking him, hitting him from behind, hitting him from in front, saying, excuse me, you know, the Shia LaBeouf approach.
[00:23:07.006 --> 00:23:08.449]  And then look what happens on social media.
[00:23:09.718 --> 00:23:20.444]  We've had Twitter, this is an article from Jerome Corsi this last week on InfoWars, Twitter allowing death threats against the FCC chair, Pi, ahead of the net neutrality vote.
[00:23:20.444 --> 00:23:23.446]  Listen to the things that Twitter thinks are okay.
[00:23:23.446 --> 00:23:27.509]  Remember they banned Roger Stone because he criticized CNN.
[00:23:29.514 --> 00:23:30.695]  And they leave people up.
[00:23:30.695 --> 00:23:32.576]  It wasn't the language that he used.
[00:23:32.576 --> 00:23:34.597]  It was the fact that he criticized CNN.
[00:23:34.597 --> 00:23:38.420]  But listen to the language that people who are threatening the FCC Commissioner say.
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.461]  And this is okay with Twitter.
[00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:40.381]  They leave this up.
[00:23:40.381 --> 00:23:41.602]  I hope you get assassinated.
[00:23:41.602 --> 00:23:42.122]  Another one.
[00:23:42.122 --> 00:23:43.163]  I have your address.
[00:23:43.163 --> 00:23:46.025]  I will go to your house for answers if this passes.
[00:23:46.025 --> 00:23:46.425]  Another one.
[00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:48.026]  People will murder you.
[00:23:48.026 --> 00:23:51.669]  Congress, Trump, and they'll put your heads on spikes.
[00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:54.271]  There's already talk and people are getting ready.
[00:23:54.271 --> 00:23:56.252]  So if you want to live, leave our Internet alone.
[00:23:56.252 --> 00:23:58.774]  These are the idiots who have been brainwashed
[00:23:59.494 --> 00:24:05.996]  By the press, brainwashed by their universities, and they feel that it is absolutely okay to be violent.
[00:24:05.996 --> 00:24:09.416]  And that is reinforced by the judges who let them off.
[00:24:09.416 --> 00:24:16.238]  The judges who let off the illegal aliens like the one that killed Kate Steinle.
[00:24:16.238 --> 00:24:17.258]  Here's some more tweets.
[00:24:17.258 --> 00:24:20.699]  We should rape his wife and tie him up with a tape logged on his mouth.
[00:24:20.699 --> 00:24:22.119]  Hear him cry while we have some fun.
[00:24:22.119 --> 00:24:22.640]  Another one.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.220]  Kill yourself.
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:23.780]  Another one.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.100]  Reminder, I hope bad things happen to you and your family.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:26.461]  Another one.
[00:24:26.461 --> 00:24:27.961]  I hope your children get cancer.
[00:24:28.755 --> 00:24:36.000]  And another one, someone needs to walk behind Ajit and inject him with bleach or introduce a meat cleaver to his skull.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.063]  In short, I agree, he's a horrific person and he deserves the absolute worst.
[00:24:40.063 --> 00:24:45.347]  Finally, if net neutrality actually gets repealed, you will be the most hated person in America.
[00:24:45.347 --> 00:24:55.634]  You best delete all your social media and get plastic surgery now, because if anyone recognizes you after that, you're going to get the blank kicked out, kicked in, or hopefully killed.
[00:24:55.634 --> 00:24:57.536]  This, these are probably teenagers.
[00:24:58.558 --> 00:25:01.887]  Who are not being censored by Twitter, by social media.
[00:25:02.708 --> 00:25:03.909]  But who gets censored?
[00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:04.970]  The Polish government.
[00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.131]  By YouTube.
[00:25:06.131 --> 00:25:07.091]  What did they say?
[00:25:07.091 --> 00:25:11.935]  They had a video that said, Europe opens its eyes and admits that we are right.
[00:25:11.935 --> 00:25:12.956]  The Polish government.
[00:25:12.956 --> 00:25:15.878]  The problem is connected with what the West of Europe is struggling with.
[00:25:15.878 --> 00:25:19.380]  Decades of a policy of multiculturalism and political correctness.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:23.784]  Our government chooses a responsible way to fight the problem of illegal immigration.
[00:25:23.784 --> 00:25:27.947]  The short presentation was flagged by YouTube as being age inappropriate.
[00:25:27.947 --> 00:25:28.968]  That's the way that they censor.
[00:25:29.568 --> 00:25:33.170]  They say, well, we still left it up there, but we just flagged it as age-inappropriate.
[00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:35.592]  Why would that be age-inappropriate?
[00:25:35.592 --> 00:25:40.095]  Why isn't language, like we just saw on Twitter, why isn't that age-inappropriate?
[00:25:40.095 --> 00:25:41.916]  Why do they allow ISIS videos up?
[00:25:41.916 --> 00:25:45.418]  Why do they allow death threats up?
[00:25:45.418 --> 00:25:50.221]  Why does the judiciary allow tortures of disabled teenagers to go free?
[00:25:52.216 --> 00:26:03.565]  They say, of course, when they label it as age-inappropriate, that means that you don't have any comments, it can't be shared, it can't be embedded, it doesn't get any view count, it doesn't get any user ratings, nobody can find it.
[00:26:03.565 --> 00:26:07.128]  We've had them do that to us for things that are not violent.
[00:26:07.128 --> 00:26:19.137]  It's what they call a limited state, essentially purgatory, as we point out on News Wars, purgatory for content deemed as offensive or extremist by faceless information gatekeepers.
[00:26:19.958 --> 00:26:20.958]  That's the weaponized media.
[00:26:20.958 --> 00:26:25.821]  And the weaponized media, of course, is part of the social media.
[00:26:25.821 --> 00:26:35.225]  Because the old dinosaur media, whatever you want to call them, nobody is paying that much attention to CNN, to ABC, NBC, CBS.
[00:26:35.225 --> 00:26:40.347]  Where the real power is, where the real censorship must be, is on social media.
[00:26:40.347 --> 00:26:42.428]  And this is crony censorship.
[00:26:43.772 --> 00:26:47.177]  If the government were to come in and shut things down, some people might wake up.
[00:26:47.177 --> 00:26:49.120]  Even some liberals at that point might wake up.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:49.941]  I don't know, maybe they wouldn't.
[00:26:49.941 --> 00:26:54.988]  Maybe their hatred has blinded them so much they wouldn't wake up even if the government were to directly censor people.
[00:26:54.988 --> 00:26:56.911]  That day is coming soon.
[00:26:56.911 --> 00:26:57.792]  Make no mistake about it.
[00:26:58.595 --> 00:27:00.937]  But they don't want to head on with anybody.
[00:27:00.937 --> 00:27:10.944]  What they want to do is have their corporate surrogates, who operate under a position of crony capitalism, they want them to do the censorship.
[00:27:10.944 --> 00:27:12.005]  We've seen this before.
[00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:19.670]  When I've been involved with the third party, wanting to get into debates, and of course we had to jump through hoops that the Democrats and Republicans never had to jump through to get on the ballot.
[00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:25.434]  Once on the ballot, the debates are being run by a private corporation.
[00:27:26.315 --> 00:27:28.436]  Usually, it was a media association.
[00:27:28.436 --> 00:27:33.058]  Some kind of newspaper or news association would run the debates.
[00:27:33.058 --> 00:27:36.680]  And they would choose to exclude us arbitrarily.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.881]  And we would say, how can you judge?
[00:27:38.881 --> 00:27:40.041]  We would appeal to the government.
[00:27:40.041 --> 00:27:41.722]  They'd say, well, it's a private organization.
[00:27:41.722 --> 00:27:42.762]  They can do whatever they want.
[00:27:42.762 --> 00:27:44.363]  Who gave them that power?
[00:27:44.363 --> 00:27:52.387]  Oh, that would be the government run by the Republicans and the Democrats would give them the power of censorship over other people to decide who's going to be included and who isn't.
[00:27:53.137 --> 00:28:13.247]  And of course the government was there at the beginning, funding through In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture capital firm and other means, funding the creation of Google and Facebook, helping to give them a default monopoly, and then standing back and proclaiming innocence as they shut other people down, as the surrogates for the government.
[00:28:14.656 --> 00:28:15.837]  They have to go a little bit further.
[00:28:15.837 --> 00:28:18.299]  They have to shut down all political debate.
[00:28:18.299 --> 00:28:19.560]  Do it with algorithms.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:27.547]  And then once they do that, then you'll have the hardcore censorship that'll come straight from the government, just like it does in China.
[00:28:27.547 --> 00:28:30.550]  But right now, they're using their surrogates.
[00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:32.091]  That's the weaponized media.
[00:28:32.091 --> 00:28:36.535]  That's the media that doesn't complain when weapons are used against real media.
[00:28:36.535 --> 00:28:39.738]  When they're used against people like Owen, trying to report on an event.
[00:28:39.738 --> 00:28:40.058]  Stay with us.
[00:28:40.058 --> 00:28:40.678]  We'll be right back.

[00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:15.338]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:15.538 --> 00:32:20.422]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:32:34.394 --> 00:32:36.135]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:32:36.255 --> 00:32:37.916]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:11.523 --> 00:33:14.165]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:14.165 --> 00:33:20.468]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:20.468 --> 00:33:24.290]  Welcome back.
[00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:25.231]  I'm David Knight.
[00:33:25.231 --> 00:33:30.593]  On this Sunday, December the 10th, 2017, a lot of things have happened in the last couple of days.
[00:33:30.593 --> 00:33:33.035]  A lot of fake news coming after President Trump.
[00:33:33.035 --> 00:33:40.019]  And we've also had another sexual harassment case, this time coming after a judge in the Ninth Circuit Court.
[00:33:41.075 --> 00:33:45.438]  The liberal court that gets overturned more than all the rest of them combined, I believe.
[00:33:45.438 --> 00:33:48.940]  I'm just kind of guessing because it gets overturned so frequently.
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:57.586]  But as one of the judges there, unfortunately, he is supposedly the conservative at the court, now being outed for sexual harassment.
[00:33:57.586 --> 00:34:00.088]  We'll tell you about that as well as some updates too.
[00:34:01.238 --> 00:34:05.940]  Of the latest sexual harassment circus that is going on in Washington, D.C.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:10.181]  Before we do, real quickly, I want to let you know about some of the sales we have at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:14.663]  That's what funds this news program, as well as the other programs that we've added.
[00:34:14.663 --> 00:34:18.504]  Of course, I have a program Monday through Friday at 8 a.m.
[00:34:18.504 --> 00:34:25.767]  in the morning, and Owen Schor, we've added a program War Room in the afternoon after the four hours of the Alex Jones Show, Monday through Friday.
[00:34:25.767 --> 00:34:27.547]  That's another three-hour program.
[00:34:27.547 --> 00:34:29.528]  We're able to do that because of your support.
[00:34:30.373 --> 00:34:33.315]  And we're proud to offer you products that support your health.
[00:34:33.315 --> 00:34:40.080]  So you're able to support free and independent media at the same time you support your health and your family's health.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.143]  DNA Force is now 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:34:43.143 --> 00:34:45.304]  It's a great time to stock up on that.
[00:34:45.304 --> 00:34:50.148]  That's a big savings, folks, because it's a very expensive product to produce.
[00:34:50.148 --> 00:34:55.452]  So the price is high on that, typically higher than most of our other supplements because of BioPQQ.
[00:34:55.452 --> 00:34:56.253]  It's a very difficult
[00:34:56.713 --> 00:34:59.755]  It's one of the things that scientists have found if they look at that telomere
[00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:24.873]  They can predict your natural lifespan because that gradually decreases over your life.
[00:35:24.873 --> 00:35:33.637]  There are some things that will accelerate that and the absence of some things as they found from some studies of some Amish people who did not have a protein that makes that disappear.
[00:35:33.637 --> 00:35:36.619]  They found those individuals had a 10 year longer lifespan.
[00:35:37.179 --> 00:35:40.243]  Because that protein did not eat away the telomere.
[00:35:40.243 --> 00:35:49.614]  So there are things that you can do or things that can take away destructive elements in your system that may be there due to hereditary instances or just due to environment.
[00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:57.183]  There are things that you can do that can help to prevent or to slow down the erosion of the telomere because once that comes off it's just like the end cap off of your
[00:35:57.978 --> 00:35:58.198]  I don't
[00:36:14.265 --> 00:36:38.440]  Put that in a drink mix very easy to take gives you a baseline nutrition 50% off that sale is going to be ending very soon We're about to run out of stock on that and also on super blue fluoride free products We have both our toothpaste and our mouthwashes 50% off at Infowarsstore.com and super blue does not have fluoride in it, but it does have iodine and nano silver to fight bacteria
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.466]  That leads to gum disease, and that leads to tooth loss, as well as to heart disease.
[00:36:43.466 --> 00:36:46.029]  And it's a great tasting product.
[00:36:46.029 --> 00:36:48.593]  We also have a new product that we've introduced, Alpha Power.
[00:36:48.593 --> 00:36:54.481]  So take a look at the products that we have at InfoWarsStore.com, and we appreciate your support, especially this time of year.
[00:36:55.816 --> 00:37:00.338]  Alright, so we've got Al Franken, who resigned last week, or maybe he didn't resign, who knows.
[00:37:00.338 --> 00:37:08.281]  We had a poll up, I put a poll up on Libertarian, my Twitter site, and we had about 11,500 people vote on it.
[00:37:08.281 --> 00:37:10.322]  50% of them think that he's planning on staying.
[00:37:10.322 --> 00:37:11.722]  I think he is.
[00:37:11.722 --> 00:37:15.784]  I think it's looking to him as well as to other people that Roy Moore is going to win in Alabama.
[00:37:16.874 --> 00:37:20.616]  They are now even having their polls come back.
[00:37:20.616 --> 00:37:26.658]  This is a headline from The Hill saying, more bumps Jones from the top of an Alabama Senate poll.
[00:37:26.658 --> 00:37:30.480]  Jones has never been on the top of any of these Alabama Senate polls.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.042]  This is one of the most Republican areas, most pro-Trump areas you're going to find.
[00:37:35.042 --> 00:37:44.326]  And they're now moving from the push poll stage, where you do polls and you pick the mix of voters, Democrat and Republican, to get the outcome that you want.
[00:37:44.326 --> 00:37:46.227]  Then you tell everybody, look, my candidate is winning.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:38:11.642]  So, they went through this push-pull stage, and now it's not worked, it hasn't worked, they realize it's not working, and they're going into the damage control stage, where they tell people, yeah, we knew that Roy Moore was going to win, and so now, this is very telling, I think, when you see the Hill and others start to come out with this, and the fact that he is getting so desperate, that he is bringing in Cory Booker,
[00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:18.172]  And the Governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick, to campaign for him.
[00:38:18.172 --> 00:38:24.575]  After having criticized the Moore campaign for having Steve Bannon come down and call Steve Bannon a carpetbagger.
[00:38:24.575 --> 00:38:29.917]  Do you think that the Senator from New Jersey and the Governor of Massachusetts, as liberal as they are,
[00:38:30.859 --> 00:38:31.119]  I think?
[00:38:49.554 --> 00:38:57.527]  Roy Moore and the election in Alabama had a direct appeal to the voters there and he's going to be in Alabama campaigning for Roy Moore tomorrow.
[00:38:57.527 --> 00:39:02.835]  But I think as Al Franken is looking at this, I think it's very important for him there was a real revolt.
[00:39:03.629 --> 00:39:14.719]  Building against Al Franken, with the women in the Senate, especially the Democrats, especially the women, but it was not just women, but mostly women, coming after him.
[00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:17.121]  He had to tamp that down, whatever he's going to do.
[00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:24.006]  Whether he's going to try to have a career, go back to Saturday Night Live, or whatever he's going to do with his life after this.
[00:39:24.006 --> 00:39:25.648]  He had to tamp that down, number one.
[00:39:25.648 --> 00:39:29.851]  Number two, he never admitted to doing anything wrong.
[00:39:30.677 --> 00:39:38.839]  He held a press conference and he criticized President Trump and Roy Moore and said, in the coming weeks I will be resigning.
[00:39:38.839 --> 00:39:41.279]  He didn't resign and he didn't admit anything wrong.
[00:39:41.279 --> 00:39:44.160]  Instead he called the women who accused him liars.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:50.561]  And I'm surprised that there hasn't been more reaction from even the Democrats on this.
[00:39:50.561 --> 00:39:55.682]  The fact that he presented himself as a champion of women and said they have a right to be heard but not to be believed.
[00:39:56.351 --> 00:39:57.552]  Not by Al Franken anyway.
[00:39:57.552 --> 00:40:00.874]  So, I think that he's not simply just staying for the Christmas party.
[00:40:00.874 --> 00:40:09.599]  I think he's waiting for Roy Moore to get in and then say, see, you can't throw me out and I'm staying.
[00:40:09.599 --> 00:40:14.662]  When in reality, what is happening is the people in Alabama do not believe the charges against Roy Moore.
[00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:25.009]  And we have just had, and we'll talk about this more later in the broadcast, but now Gloria Allred's client, the one with the phony yearbook, came out and said, yeah, yeah, some of that I wrote.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:29.602]  It's just collapsing on them at the last minute.
[00:40:29.602 --> 00:40:31.383]  It's going very badly for them.
[00:40:31.383 --> 00:40:33.484]  And so nobody believes those charges.
[00:40:33.484 --> 00:40:34.965]  But everybody has seen pictures.
[00:40:34.965 --> 00:40:38.267]  They've seen a lot of contemporary charges against Al Franken.
[00:40:38.267 --> 00:40:40.728]  A lot of stuff has surfaced from him.
[00:40:40.728 --> 00:40:42.810]  There's no question about it with Al Franken.
[00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:46.871]  And he's going to try to create an equivalency there.
[00:40:46.871 --> 00:40:50.032]  And there you can see these people showing the yearbook.
[00:40:50.032 --> 00:40:51.492]  We're going to get back to that in a moment.
[00:40:51.492 --> 00:40:54.753]  I want to talk about what's going on in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[00:40:54.753 --> 00:41:00.435]  As Fox News reported, a prominent appeals court judge in the Ninth Circuit Court has been accused of sexual harassment.
[00:41:00.435 --> 00:41:04.296]  He was the former chief judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
[00:41:04.296 --> 00:41:06.277]  His name is Alex Kaczynski.
[00:41:07.537 --> 00:41:07.597]  67.
[00:41:07.597 --> 00:41:10.439]  He was actually appointed by Ronald Reagan.
[00:41:10.439 --> 00:41:13.941]  Somebody on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals was appointed by Ronald Reagan.
[00:41:13.941 --> 00:41:15.362]  Imagine that.
[00:41:15.362 --> 00:41:16.762]  And he may be a conservative.
[00:41:16.762 --> 00:41:17.142]  I don't know.
[00:41:17.142 --> 00:41:20.564]  Maybe everybody else is drowning out all of his votes here.
[00:41:20.564 --> 00:41:23.086]  But this isn't actually his first rodeo.
[00:41:24.201 --> 00:41:32.987]  He has been accused by several women, two women, told the Washington Post that he asked them to look at pornography on a computer in his chambers.
[00:41:32.987 --> 00:41:40.052]  But back in 2008, he actually maintained a website with sexually explicit photos and videos.
[00:41:40.052 --> 00:41:40.832]  And he got called on it.
[00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:43.214]  There was an ethics investigation.
[00:41:43.214 --> 00:41:48.137]  And when they looked at this website, he said, you know, I shouldn't have put that up.
[00:41:48.137 --> 00:41:49.058]  I'll take it down right away.
[00:41:49.058 --> 00:41:50.279]  They go, OK, that's fine.
[00:41:50.279 --> 00:41:51.560]  Just be more careful in the future.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.601]  That's the state of our government.
[00:41:56.601 --> 00:41:57.921]  Yeah, just be more careful in the future.
[00:41:57.921 --> 00:42:11.406]  Well, I guess he wasn't careful enough, because instead of having this public website, he just kept it on his computer and decided that he would show it to the women who worked for him as they came into his office.
[00:42:11.406 --> 00:42:15.007]  And we look at this, and we look at the fact that we keep hearing that the U.S.
[00:42:15.007 --> 00:42:21.749]  House is considering changes to the law that protects the identities of politicians and pays off
[00:42:22.492 --> 00:42:24.713]  The women that they sexually harass.
[00:42:24.713 --> 00:42:30.175]  This is, believe it or not, the Office of Compliance and it was part of the Congressional Accountability Act.
[00:42:30.175 --> 00:42:33.536]  And they say, well, we can't tell you who these people are.
[00:42:33.536 --> 00:42:36.437]  They call it the Congressional Accountability Act.
[00:42:36.437 --> 00:42:45.500]  You know, just like we had the Patriot Act, and we had the USA Freedom Act, or the Affordable Health Care Act, which was not affordable, didn't have anything to do with health care.
[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:51.783]  And now this is the Congressional Accountability Act, which conceals when these people
[00:42:53.018 --> 00:42:57.128]  Engage in sexual harassment and pays up to 17 million dollars so far.
[00:42:58.308 --> 00:42:59.129]  I'm so excited.
[00:42:59.129 --> 00:43:09.275]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:43:09.275 --> 00:43:14.779]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:43:14.779 --> 00:43:17.801]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:43:17.801 --> 00:43:26.587]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:43:28.648 --> 00:43:48.253]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:43:48.253 --> 00:43:50.934]  It is amazing!
[00:43:50.934 --> 00:43:55.895]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.

[00:45:27.396 --> 00:45:27.656]  Woo!

[00:45:28.676 --> 00:45:37.420]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:45.522]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:45:47.003 --> 00:45:50.445]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.

[00:47:01.233 --> 00:47:03.874]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.251 --> 00:47:23.834]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:23.834 --> 00:47:28.740]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:29.822]  Welcome back, I'm David Knight.
[00:47:31.039 --> 00:47:38.363]  You know, Saul Alinsky in his Rules for Radicals, one of the rules said, ridicule is the most powerful weapon.
[00:47:38.363 --> 00:47:45.446]  And I think that's what's behind a lot of these ad hominem attacks that we see against people in the Trump administration.
[00:47:45.446 --> 00:47:53.110]  The most vicious ones coming from Chelsea Handler now, attacking Sarah Sanders, who's the White House Press Secretary.
[00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:55.011]  She's doing a great job!
[00:47:55.011 --> 00:47:59.833]  The only thing that they can say about Sarah Sanders is try to destroy her with ridicule.
[00:48:01.011 --> 00:48:03.413]  And Chelsea Handler has been all over this.
[00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:12.738]  Of course, I don't think that Chelsea Handler probably isn't smart enough to realize, to use Saul Alinsky's rule for radicals as a strategy.
[00:48:12.738 --> 00:48:15.920]  I think she's simply looking at this and saying, hey, it worked for Stephen Colbert.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:20.763]  His show was failing until he started mocking President Trump and Republicans and Trump voters.
[00:48:20.763 --> 00:48:21.844]  Worked for Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:48:21.844 --> 00:48:24.585]  It even works for failing Saturday Night Live.
[00:48:24.585 --> 00:48:28.468]  They can keep doing the same joke every week with Alec Baldwin.
[00:48:29.228 --> 00:48:32.110]  And it never seems to get stale to their audiences.
[00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:41.696]  So I guess Chelsea Handler, as she got her Netflix show cancelled, as we have seen in the past, that Chelsea Handler will do anything, anything, to try to get an audience.
[00:48:42.679 --> 00:48:47.483]  Including taking her clothes off and admitting, hey, I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't want to be famous.
[00:48:47.483 --> 00:48:55.849]  And yet she comes after Sarah Sanders and calls Sarah Sanders a whore because of the way she puts on makeup.
[00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:56.910]  She doesn't like her makeup.
[00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:57.871]  Oh, really?
[00:48:57.871 --> 00:48:58.731]  Really?
[00:48:58.731 --> 00:49:00.673]  That's Chelsea Handler.
[00:49:00.673 --> 00:49:08.239]  So she gets somebody who is a comedian, and I guess a comedian, I use that term lightly, they would call themselves that.
[00:49:09.053 --> 00:49:14.938]  And they do a video now mocking Sarah Sanders putting on makeup.
[00:49:14.938 --> 00:49:18.081]  A morbidly obese woman putting on makeup.
[00:49:18.081 --> 00:49:19.302]  And here's part of that video.
[00:49:19.302 --> 00:49:25.727]  And I want to give you the response of Sarah Sanders' father, Mike Huckabee, after we finish this.
[00:49:25.727 --> 00:49:30.311]  It was a masterful and really quite truthful and compassionate takedown.
[00:49:30.996 --> 00:49:38.863]  He threw some shade on her that she deserved, but it was very compassionate, really, kind of reaching out to her and talking to other people like her.
[00:49:38.863 --> 00:49:44.288]  But let's take a look at the latest hit piece from Chelsea Handler against Sarah Sanders.
[00:49:45.106 --> 00:49:47.710]  Hey y'all, it's me, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:50.493]  Here's my first makeup YouTube tutorial.
[00:49:50.493 --> 00:49:51.174]  Woo!
[00:49:51.174 --> 00:49:54.459]  Now I like to start with a nice moisturizer.
[00:49:54.459 --> 00:49:56.622]  I like to just sop it up here.
[00:49:56.622 --> 00:50:00.147]  Right now my skin is dry, just like Puerto Rico right before that one rainy day.
[00:50:00.147 --> 00:50:00.988]  Is this a woman or is this a man?
[00:50:00.988 --> 00:50:01.589]  I'm not really sure.
[00:50:02.056 --> 00:50:02.556]  I don't know.
[00:50:02.556 --> 00:50:03.357]  Isn't that funny?
[00:50:03.357 --> 00:50:05.939]  Are you all rolling on the floor laughing at this comedian?
[00:50:23.573 --> 00:50:24.674]  Get a look at that.
[00:50:24.674 --> 00:50:28.795]  This is foundation, just like the foundation of America.
[00:50:28.795 --> 00:50:33.517]  It's Republican, it's strong, and it's white.
[00:50:33.517 --> 00:50:34.698]  Actually, it looks pretty brown.
[00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:38.700]  Alright, so we're going to take this foundation and grab you a beauty blender.
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.581]  Now this is a beauty blender right here.
[00:50:40.581 --> 00:50:43.702]  It may look like a butt plug, but it's not.
[00:50:43.702 --> 00:50:46.123]  Stick a beauty blender up your butt once.
[00:50:46.123 --> 00:50:48.664]  Okay, so let's just kind of leave this.
[00:50:48.664 --> 00:50:50.365]  This is the left.
[00:50:50.365 --> 00:50:52.686]  And you want to know why we have so much perversion?
[00:50:53.576 --> 00:50:54.856]  And sexual harassment there.
[00:50:54.856 --> 00:50:57.938]  It's because women are like that, if that is in fact a woman.
[00:50:57.938 --> 00:50:59.318]  I don't know.
[00:50:59.318 --> 00:51:04.980]  Scroll a little bit to the end so people can see the end result here of this quote-unquote comedian.
[00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:08.281]  Fortune Feimster is the person's name.
[00:51:08.281 --> 00:51:11.022]  Not sure if that's male or female.
[00:51:11.022 --> 00:51:12.682]  And I'm not sure that that's funny.
[00:51:12.682 --> 00:51:14.683]  Certainly isn't funny to me.
[00:51:14.683 --> 00:51:15.243]  There we go.
[00:51:15.243 --> 00:51:22.286]  That's the end result of this child in front of a camera rubbing makeup all over his or her face.
[00:51:23.406 --> 00:51:31.871]  To make fun of Sarah Sanders, who is taking down the press every day, left and right, like a boss.
[00:51:31.871 --> 00:51:36.693]  And all they can do is try to make fun of her putting on her makeup.
[00:51:36.693 --> 00:51:39.955]  Here's what Mike Huckabee had to say.
[00:51:39.955 --> 00:51:43.097]  Of course, Sarah Sanders is his daughter.
[00:51:43.097 --> 00:51:45.298]  Here's what he has to say when people asked him about that.
[00:51:47.597 --> 00:51:52.219]  Really quickly, though, to another topic, and that is late night host Chelsea Handler.
[00:51:52.219 --> 00:51:59.743]  She, as I'm sure you saw, made, I thought, a disgusting mocking video of your daughter, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.
[00:51:59.743 --> 00:52:14.371]  And this is my thing, Governor, as you know, I have very little crossover politically with your daughter, but I have to tell you, I think she's doing an incredible job in a very difficult role, and I was sickened by this display of just anti-feminism.
[00:52:14.371 --> 00:52:16.172]  It just backfires on the rest of the stuff that they're doing.
[00:52:16.772 --> 00:52:22.856]  Chelsea Handler, what's your reaction as both a politician and also a father?
[00:52:22.856 --> 00:52:25.838]  Well, as a father, you never like to see this kind of stuff on your kids.
[00:52:25.838 --> 00:52:27.699]  But, you know, my daughter's an adult.
[00:52:27.699 --> 00:52:30.441]  She's lived in the political arena her whole life.
[00:52:30.441 --> 00:52:31.862]  She understands it.
[00:52:31.862 --> 00:52:32.563]  She gets it.
[00:52:32.563 --> 00:52:34.524]  She doesn't particularly like it.
[00:52:34.524 --> 00:52:38.547]  But it doesn't get to her like I'm sure Chelsea Handler wishes it did.
[00:52:39.467 --> 00:52:41.489]  My daughter's a very balanced person.
[00:52:41.489 --> 00:52:53.238]  She wakes up every morning to a loving husband, to three adorable children whose arms circle her neck, and it's something that gives her a balance that I feel sorry for Chelsea Handler.
[00:52:53.238 --> 00:52:55.480]  It's not something she understands.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:00.044]  Her vicious attacks are beginning to backfire on her, and you know, she's called a late-night host.
[00:53:00.044 --> 00:53:03.127]  I think it's so late now that she's not on anymore.
[00:53:03.127 --> 00:53:05.268]  Oh, epic saying from Governor Huckabee!
[00:53:08.398 --> 00:53:15.421]  She's moving into the realm of Keith Olbermann, where people can no longer take her seriously.
[00:53:15.421 --> 00:53:19.622]  But honestly, I feel sorry for her, and I owe her an apology.
[00:53:19.622 --> 00:53:32.227]  Because last week, in talking about some other vicious things she said about my daughter, I said, look, she's almost my age, she needs to kind of start mellowing out, and then I realized she's nowhere near my age.
[00:53:33.207 --> 00:53:34.248]  She just looked like it.
[00:53:34.248 --> 00:53:36.129]  And I thought, that's unfortunate.
[00:53:36.129 --> 00:53:38.611]  And I'm not saying that to be mean.
[00:53:38.611 --> 00:53:39.271]  No, seriously.
[00:53:39.271 --> 00:53:40.932]  And I'm trying to be honest here.
[00:53:40.932 --> 00:53:48.617]  When people are bitter, and they live their lives in anger and hostility toward others, it shows.
[00:53:48.617 --> 00:53:52.360]  It takes away a countenance that people need.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.101]  And I'm not trying to be funny.
[00:53:54.101 --> 00:54:02.026]  Honestly, people who are bitter and angry and lash out at others and have no sense of personal balance and joy,
[00:54:03.668 --> 00:54:07.752]  It's unfortunate, and that's why I say with all sincerity, I feel sorry for her.
[00:54:07.752 --> 00:54:10.414]  I don't envy her, and I guarantee you my daughter doesn't.
[00:54:19.997 --> 00:54:24.939]  But there was a wit who once said, by 40, we all have the face we deserve.
[00:54:24.939 --> 00:54:31.062]  I think that's what Mike Huckabee was talking about when he said, I thought she was my age.
[00:54:31.062 --> 00:54:39.066]  And he was saying the bitterness that is inside of Chelsea Handler just bubbles up to the surface in a very ugly way.
[00:54:39.066 --> 00:54:42.288]  She doesn't realize the blessings of life.
[00:54:43.622 --> 00:54:46.484]  Of a home, a family, of children.
[00:54:46.484 --> 00:54:48.244]  And she is viciously striking out.
[00:54:48.244 --> 00:54:53.367]  Just as her show was cancelled, he pointed out that it's gotten so late that it's now disappeared.
[00:54:53.367 --> 00:54:55.788]  It is now late as in dead and gone.
[00:54:55.788 --> 00:54:59.070]  The Chelsea Handler show that was on Netflix, it's cancelled.
[00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:01.151]  So this is why she's desperate.
[00:55:01.151 --> 00:55:03.372]  She says she's going to focus on politics.
[00:55:03.372 --> 00:55:06.914]  I don't know if that's really the focus of what she's doing, but it's backfiring.
[00:55:06.914 --> 00:55:09.455]  Just as the attacks against President Trump are backfiring.
[00:55:10.299 --> 00:55:18.023]  One of the people responding to Chelsea Handler on Twitter, a lot of people kicked back on her.
[00:55:18.023 --> 00:55:27.809]  Said, glad to see how much of a strong feminist you are, Chelsea Handler, by promoting positive body image of other females.
[00:55:27.809 --> 00:55:30.911]  Because she said, this woman deserves to be taken down, she is pure evil.
[00:55:30.911 --> 00:55:35.973]  So she's going to do anything that she can to destroy Sarah Sanders personally.
[00:55:35.973 --> 00:55:36.474]  She's not evil.
[00:55:37.375 --> 00:55:47.920]  She is able to restore some rationale to these press conferences where it is nothing but weaponized, irrational attacks against President Trump.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.401]  But anyway, Mike Huckabee is right.
[00:55:50.401 --> 00:55:52.242]  These vicious attacks are starting to backfire.
[00:55:52.242 --> 00:55:53.402]  And here's another one that backfired.
[00:55:53.402 --> 00:55:56.003]  A vicious attack against President Trump.
[00:55:56.003 --> 00:55:57.644]  And it was from Dave Weigel.
[00:55:59.053 --> 00:56:00.835]  Washington Post reporter.
[00:56:00.835 --> 00:56:07.523]  He tweeted out pictures of an empty stadium as President Trump was making his speech in Pensacola, Florida.
[00:56:07.523 --> 00:56:10.106]  Except that it was simply a hit job.
[00:56:10.106 --> 00:56:15.952]  And as Zero Hedge points out, a day after CNN botched their hit job on President Trump and his son,
[00:56:16.933 --> 00:56:28.597]  Which came a week after the erroneous ABC report on General Flynn sent stocks tumbling, which came a month after Bloomberg's Justin Sink launched Coigate during President Trump's trip to Japan.
[00:56:28.597 --> 00:56:34.760]  Then we have this guy, Dave Weigel, tweets out a photo of an empty arena before the Trump rally.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.640]  It was taken hours before the rally.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:41.902]  Of course, there were a lot of people there and they took pictures of the rally as it was underway.
[00:56:41.902 --> 00:56:43.423]  So clearly that was
[00:56:44.463 --> 00:56:44.984]  A lie.
[00:56:44.984 --> 00:56:46.045]  He got called out on it.
[00:56:46.045 --> 00:56:50.209]  He eventually came back and apologized.
[00:56:50.209 --> 00:56:54.494]  But President Trump says, why aren't we doing something about this?
[00:56:55.851 --> 00:57:05.461]  And when we look at the CNN issue, you've got Glenn Greenwald out there saying, how did this mistake in the date get past all these different people?
[00:57:05.461 --> 00:57:12.488]  They said no action is going to be taken against a CNN reporter who falsely reported this information against President Trump's son.
[00:57:12.488 --> 00:57:14.149]  No action will be taken.
[00:57:14.149 --> 00:57:16.171]  It was reviewed, and we followed our procedures.
[00:57:16.874 --> 00:57:21.816]  All that means is that your corruption and your fake news is systemic.
[00:57:21.816 --> 00:57:22.937]  It runs throughout the organization.
[00:57:22.937 --> 00:57:24.417]  It wasn't the error of one reporter.
[00:57:24.417 --> 00:57:25.758]  We all did that.
[00:57:25.758 --> 00:57:26.979]  We all looked over that.
[00:57:26.979 --> 00:57:30.580]  We all did our non-diligence on reporting that information.
[00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:31.801]  So they own that.
[00:57:31.801 --> 00:57:32.201]  They own that.
[00:57:32.201 --> 00:57:35.182]  But then, of course, they're saying, wait a minute, President Trump.
[00:57:35.182 --> 00:57:39.925]  You shouldn't criticize that guy for putting out a fake picture of your rally and saying that nobody turned up.
[00:57:40.945 --> 00:57:42.066]  You're not entitled to do that.
[00:57:42.066 --> 00:57:44.228]  That's censoring free speech.
[00:57:44.228 --> 00:57:47.730]  No, they're the ones who are censoring free speech by their fake narrative.
[00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:48.371]  We'll be right back.

[00:59:50.654 --> 00:59:53.255]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:01.831]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:06.693]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.338 --> 01:00:38.384]  Newly appointed FBI Director Christopher Wray was on the Hill, attempting to save face for the Bureau clearly overcome with a biased political agenda, wielding federal powers to benefit Mueller's Russian witch hunt, Hillary Clinton's breach of national security, Obama's corrupt DOJ, and Comey's lapdog FBI.
[01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:40.544]  Here's what I think, Director Wray.
[01:00:40.544 --> 01:00:46.226]  I think Peter Strzok, head of counterintelligence at the FBI, Peter Strzok
[01:00:47.369 --> 01:00:50.971]  The guy who ran the Clinton investigation, did all the interviews.
[01:00:50.971 --> 01:00:55.794]  Peter Strzok, the guy who was running the Russian investigation at the FBI.
[01:00:55.794 --> 01:00:59.676]  Peter Strzok, Mr. Super Agent at the FBI.
[01:00:59.676 --> 01:01:04.018]  I think he's the guy who took the application to the FISA court.
[01:01:04.018 --> 01:01:11.943]  And if that happened, I mean, think if this happened, if you had the FBI working with a campaign, the Democrats campaign.
[01:01:13.697 --> 01:01:21.582]  Taking opposition research, dressing it all up and turning it into an intelligence document and taking it to the FISA court so they can spy on the other campaign?
[01:01:21.582 --> 01:01:24.944]  If that happened, that is as wrong as it gets.
[01:01:24.944 --> 01:01:25.405]  And you know what?
[01:01:26.621 --> 01:01:27.382]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[01:01:27.382 --> 01:01:28.502]  You can clear it all up.
[01:01:28.502 --> 01:01:32.905]  You can clear it all up for all of us here, all the Congress who wants to know, and frankly, all of America who wants to know.
[01:01:32.905 --> 01:01:35.827]  You can clear it all up by releasing... We sent you a letter two days ago.
[01:01:35.827 --> 01:01:36.928]  Just release the application.
[01:01:36.928 --> 01:01:38.149]  Tell us what was in it.
[01:01:38.149 --> 01:01:39.549]  Tell us if I'm wrong.
[01:01:39.549 --> 01:01:40.310]  But I don't think I am.
[01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:42.732]  I think that's exactly what happened.
[01:01:42.732 --> 01:01:44.993]  And if it did, it is as wrong as it can be.
[01:01:44.993 --> 01:01:47.675]  And people who did that need to be held accountable.
[01:01:48.155 --> 01:02:01.439]  Surely you've examined the definition and the distinction between extreme carelessness and also extreme carelessness and the rigorous negligence that's within the statute.
[01:02:01.439 --> 01:02:05.860]  Are you really going to tell us today that you don't have an opinion on that distinction?
[01:02:07.328 --> 01:02:11.089]  Gross negligence is the language in the statute, I believe.
[01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:19.392]  But I believe also that almost anybody who grabbed a thesaurus would say that gross negligence and extremely careless are pretty darn close to each other.
[01:02:19.392 --> 01:02:25.794]  The Democrats are actually scared that the whole Russia investigation is going to turn against them.
[01:02:25.794 --> 01:02:32.156]  I mean, these are pretty remarkable revelations that we saw yesterday with Christopher Wray, who, by the way,
[01:02:35.182 --> 01:02:35.522]  I don't
[01:02:56.238 --> 01:03:08.304]  Fusion GPS dossier, the discredited dossier, was used to get FISA court approval to wiretap electronic surveillance on the Trump campaign.
[01:03:08.304 --> 01:03:16.408]  And I think it's very clear, as Jim Jordan pointed out yesterday in the House Judiciary Committee, that this is at the core of the corruption.
[01:03:16.408 --> 01:03:19.970]  And now we find out that this judge who recused himself
[01:03:20.718 --> 01:03:33.270]  In the Flynn prosecution, we didn't know why until we found out that he is on the FISA court and could be perhaps the very one who gave the FBI approval to wiretap Trump.
[01:03:33.889 --> 01:03:38.650]  And his campaign, based on this lying, fake dossier.
[01:03:38.650 --> 01:03:44.091]  And now we've got fake indictments out of the swamp, out of these kept grand juries.
[01:03:44.091 --> 01:03:48.792]  And the word is Mueller's looking at an indictment, maybe even of Trump, by Christmas.
[01:03:48.792 --> 01:03:50.712]  Are they crazy enough to try to pull this off?
[01:03:50.712 --> 01:03:58.454]  When in front of God, country, and the whole world, naked as jaybirds, they're all one big crew engaged in massive fraud openly.
[01:03:59.295 --> 01:04:04.700]  Following the oversight hearing, Representative Trey Gowdy wrote on Twitter, Well, we'll see about that.
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.942]  The FBI needs to begin by investigating itself.
[01:04:06.942 --> 01:04:08.384]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:04:25.598 --> 01:04:34.081]  Alright, and I'm David Knight, and we're here live, and right after the break, we're going to give you an update on what's happening in the Roy Moore election, the Alabama Senate election.
[01:04:34.081 --> 01:04:35.101]  That's what we call the Roy Moore.
[01:04:35.101 --> 01:04:36.321]  It's his to lose.
[01:04:36.321 --> 01:04:37.702]  It's a highly Republican area.
[01:04:37.702 --> 01:04:40.483]  We're going to see what happens in that and what is happening.
[01:04:40.483 --> 01:04:44.844]  More news breaking in that, as well as the Pentagon will be audited.
[01:04:44.844 --> 01:04:46.645]  There are trillions of dollars missing.
[01:04:46.645 --> 01:04:49.665]  They even have 44,000 troops they can't account for.
[01:04:49.665 --> 01:04:51.886]  I mean, this is serious stuff, folks.
[01:04:51.886 --> 01:04:53.207]  Stay with us when we come back.
[01:04:53.207 --> 01:04:54.387]  We'll get into those subjects and more.
[01:04:56.693 --> 01:05:01.096]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[01:05:01.096 --> 01:05:09.202]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:05:09.202 --> 01:05:14.485]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:05:14.485 --> 01:05:17.007]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:05:17.007 --> 01:05:20.410]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:24.352]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:05:24.352 --> 01:05:31.596]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[01:05:31.596 --> 01:05:39.660]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:46.864]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:05:46.864 --> 01:05:48.305]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:05:48.305 --> 01:05:50.126]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[01:05:50.926 --> 01:05:54.409]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[01:05:54.409 --> 01:06:04.018]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:04.018 --> 01:06:12.345]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:19.568 --> 01:06:21.789]  Welcome back, I'm David Knight, on this Sunday, December the 10th.
[01:06:21.789 --> 01:06:28.431]  You know, it's amazing because this last week we had CNN come out and say, Trump, the promise keeper.
[01:06:28.431 --> 01:06:30.412]  That's what's got them so upset.
[01:06:30.412 --> 01:06:38.695]  They never expected him to do half of what he said he was going to do, and here we are, a year in, and he's delivered on quite a bit of stuff, in spite of the fact.
[01:06:39.497 --> 01:07:00.245]  That you have the uni-party leaders, both Republican and Democrats, who try to block him on every measure, and even people in his own cabinet, which is interesting how he has surrounded himself with people who are against the agenda that he campaigned on, and yet he continues to outmaneuver them and shut them down and deliver on his agenda.
[01:07:01.645 --> 01:07:04.145]  Items was, of course, the moving the U.S.
[01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:12.607]  Embassy to Jerusalem, the announcement that he would do that, but also recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
[01:07:12.607 --> 01:07:14.367]  And it got all these Democrats upset.
[01:07:14.367 --> 01:07:17.308]  They're really angry about this.
[01:07:17.308 --> 01:07:18.648]  And here's two of them.
[01:07:18.648 --> 01:07:25.829]  As we've got Julian Assange tweets out, says, Bernie Sanders, along with 90 other senators, unanimously voted to move the U.S.
[01:07:25.829 --> 01:07:28.210]  Embassy to Jerusalem just this last June.
[01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.150]  You know, we talked about the
[01:07:30.276 --> 01:07:35.440]  The Jerusalem Embassy Act that was passed in 1995.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.882]  And the Senate, it was passed 93 to 5.
[01:07:37.882 --> 01:07:46.489]  I don't want to imagine if you go back and look, I'm just guessing here, but Sanders and Feinstein have been there for so long, they probably were the ones who voted for it even back in 1995.
[01:07:46.489 --> 01:07:53.595]  And since then, we've had all these presidents not doing what they said they were going to do.
[01:07:53.595 --> 01:07:57.778]  They would promise so that they could get elected, they would promise certain
[01:07:58.777 --> 01:08:01.279]  Interest groups, and that's the key thing to understand here.
[01:08:01.279 --> 01:08:08.946]  Whether you agree with this or not, understand the way the politicians lie to us and the way these people are complicit.
[01:08:08.946 --> 01:08:12.949]  Because we saw the same thing happen on the Republican side with Obamacare.
[01:08:12.949 --> 01:08:19.074]  They kept coming out and saying, we're going to get rid of Obamacare, we're going to campaign on that, we're going to have votes to shut it down and so forth.
[01:08:19.074 --> 01:08:23.017]  But then when it could really pass, the Republicans refused to vote for it.
[01:08:23.017 --> 01:08:26.781]  And so you see on the Democrat side, they kept promising their constituents.
[01:08:27.501 --> 01:08:32.162]  In areas where they had a lot of Jewish voters who wanted to see this happen, the majority of Americans don't really care.
[01:08:32.162 --> 01:08:37.084]  More than 50% of Americans don't care where the embassy is, or they think that it was already in Jerusalem.
[01:08:37.084 --> 01:08:39.484]  They already thought we'd recognize that as a capital.
[01:08:39.484 --> 01:08:44.446]  But there's about a quarter who are very strongly for, and another quarter that are very strongly against.
[01:08:45.823 --> 01:08:51.765]  And these people are people that could be used when it comes time to run for office.
[01:08:51.765 --> 01:08:53.286]  Dianne Feinstein is one of these.
[01:08:53.286 --> 01:08:56.047]  She's out there saying, this is a terrible decision.
[01:08:56.047 --> 01:08:57.047]  It is dangerous.
[01:08:57.047 --> 01:09:01.508]  There's a reason that for the last several decades, all these presidents have not done this.
[01:09:01.508 --> 01:09:03.749]  And now you've done this.
[01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:04.930]  Because he said he would.
[01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:10.191]  And you said you were going to do this, and you got elected, and you took money from these lobby groups who wanted the embassy moved.
[01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:14.533]  You voted for it multiple times, Dianne Feinstein, and now you're outraged because Donald Trump actually did it.
[01:09:16.075 --> 01:09:17.676]  And that's what we see all the time.
[01:09:17.676 --> 01:09:19.836]  We see it on our issues as well.
[01:09:19.836 --> 01:09:21.457]  That's the way these people govern.
[01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:26.979]  And that's the thing that is so amazing to us and so refreshing and so infuriating to them.
[01:09:26.979 --> 01:09:29.860]  Bernie Sanders says there's a reason why none of these presidents would do this.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:34.562]  This is going to undermine the peace process and Blumenthal out of Connecticut and so on.
[01:09:34.562 --> 01:09:37.323]  They all are saying the same thing.
[01:09:37.323 --> 01:09:41.565]  And then you've got Trump's action in terms of shutting down the illegal
[01:09:42.597 --> 01:09:42.917]  Exactly.
[01:10:03.269 --> 01:10:05.510]  of declaring it a national park.
[01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:26.799]  Instead, what he did was he went back and he found an obscure law that hadn't been used, never used in this way, it was never intended to be used in this way, the Antiquities Act, which was set up to preserve land that was some kind of Indian antiquities or whatever, to preserve a small area there so it would not be looted by people who were looking for souvenirs and so forth, to protect that area.
[01:10:27.833 --> 01:10:31.294]  The famous Devil's Tower that you see out there was done that way.
[01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:36.556]  And they only took like a couple hundred acres around Devil's Tower.
[01:10:36.556 --> 01:10:39.697]  They didn't take hundreds of millions of acres.
[01:10:39.697 --> 01:10:42.138]  Which is the way Obama used it.
[01:10:42.138 --> 01:10:45.839]  Because Obama wanted to lock up these lands for federal control.
[01:10:45.839 --> 01:10:49.020]  And that truly is stealing our land.
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.500]  Stealing the people's land.
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.661]  That's what the whole Bundy issue is about.
[01:10:53.581 --> 01:11:02.823]  The fact that the federal government owns 80 to 90 percent of the land in some of these western states, and they're going to use it for their crony capitalist buddies.
[01:11:02.823 --> 01:11:08.204]  They're going to sell this as a senator, whether you're Harry Reid or you're John McCain.
[01:11:08.204 --> 01:11:18.666]  If you're part of that corrupt establishment, you can pass that over to some foreign corporation, as John McCain did, the Tonto National Forest.
[01:11:19.795 --> 01:11:21.156]  Obama didn't protect that.
[01:11:21.156 --> 01:11:26.078]  They're going to turn that into a massive crater and it's being turned over to a foreign corporation.
[01:11:26.078 --> 01:11:33.782]  This is something that has historical significance to the Indians, cultural significance to them, religious significance to them.
[01:11:33.782 --> 01:11:37.924]  It is a natural area that was a recreational area that other people wanted to preserve.
[01:11:37.924 --> 01:11:40.865]  Instead it's turned over to a foreign corporation that's going to strip mine it.
[01:11:40.865 --> 01:11:42.466]  You'll be able to see the hole from space.
[01:11:43.286 --> 01:11:44.947]  And that's what they want to do throughout Utah.
[01:11:44.947 --> 01:11:46.487]  That's why they were running all the ranchers off.
[01:11:46.487 --> 01:11:51.830]  That's why Clive and Bundy took a stand.
[01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:54.331]  All the other ranchers in that area have been run off.
[01:11:54.331 --> 01:12:03.375]  They said, from where I am all the way to the Pacific Ocean, they run all the ranchers off because they want to take this land, they can use it for the uranium, they can use it for solar power projects with the Chinese, you name it.
[01:12:04.022 --> 01:12:06.763]  They've got a long list of things that they want to use it for personally.
[01:12:06.763 --> 01:12:08.683]  It's part of the Agenda 21 idea.
[01:12:08.683 --> 01:12:12.344]  They're going to lock us in the cities, the rest of the area is going to be off-limits.
[01:12:12.344 --> 01:12:23.086]  So when President Trump rolls back just a little bit of these two projects, where Obama misused a law and did it by executive order.
[01:12:23.086 --> 01:12:25.666]  So President Trump came in and with his executive order he repealed it.
[01:12:25.666 --> 01:12:28.067]  And so Patagonia, the people who sell clothing,
[01:12:29.222 --> 01:12:31.843]  For those of you who are outdoors, remember this as you're shopping.
[01:12:31.843 --> 01:12:35.746]  It was Patagonia who comes out and says, the president stole your land.
[01:12:35.746 --> 01:12:38.167]  That's right, but they didn't say which president.
[01:12:38.167 --> 01:12:42.389]  It was Obama who stole our land, not President Trump.
[01:12:42.389 --> 01:12:53.955]  Patagonia posted a small message underneath the message on its website calling Trump's executive orders shrinking Utah's Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante National Monuments, quote, an illegal move.
[01:12:53.955 --> 01:12:57.337]  No, it was Obama's moves that were illegal.
[01:12:58.345 --> 01:13:01.810]  But this is the way we're seeing they react to this.
[01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:15.107]  Even the people like Dianne Feinstein, Bernie Sanders, and others who have voted time and time again to move the Jerusalem Embassy are outraged when President Trump actually does what he says he's going to do.
[01:13:15.953 --> 01:13:22.619]  And that's why you've got these journalists coming back and attacking President Trump when he exposes this false narrative.
[01:13:22.619 --> 01:13:25.882]  And again, why would this guy think it was important to tweet out an empty stadium?
[01:13:25.882 --> 01:13:29.585]  Well, it's because he wants to ridicule the President.
[01:13:29.585 --> 01:13:30.486]  He wants to mock him.
[01:13:30.486 --> 01:13:33.128]  Oh, look, nobody showed up to his rally.
[01:13:33.128 --> 01:13:34.489]  No, actually they did.
[01:13:34.489 --> 01:13:37.412]  But then when President Trump did that, you have these other journalists
[01:13:38.638 --> 01:13:43.984]  Backing up the Washington Post guy who tweeted this stuff out, he apologized and he retracted it.
[01:13:43.984 --> 01:13:46.608]  But the other people are saying he's a great reporter.
[01:13:46.608 --> 01:13:48.590]  He's a fantastic guide to this political age.
[01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:52.855]  I would say he is the icon of this political age.
[01:13:52.855 --> 01:13:54.957]  The hit-and-run false attack.
[01:13:55.498 --> 01:14:00.421]  Another one, Dan Pfeiffer says Trump is attacking Dave Weigel because he is sad and vain.
[01:14:00.421 --> 01:14:01.281]  So it continues on.
[01:14:01.281 --> 01:14:09.886]  Or, another one, Tommy Vitor, I don't know who he works for, the irony of this clown wanting someone fired for misrepresenting a crowd size is too much.
[01:14:09.886 --> 01:14:18.151]  And yet, they were the ones, aren't they, who made such a big deal about the size of the inauguration crowd and went on and on and on about it.
[01:14:18.151 --> 01:14:18.832]  Why did they do that?
[01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:20.291]  Why did they do that?
[01:14:20.291 --> 01:14:21.594]  Well, that was their intent.
[01:14:21.594 --> 01:14:23.017]  Their intent was to ridicule.
[01:14:23.017 --> 01:14:28.327]  Another one, Jessica Valente, the President of the United States targeting a reporter for mass harassment is a much bigger deal.
[01:14:29.116 --> 01:14:31.797]  Then a reporter mistakenly tweeting a photo.
[01:14:31.797 --> 01:14:32.238]  Why?
[01:14:32.238 --> 01:14:33.358]  Why is it a bigger deal?
[01:14:33.358 --> 01:14:53.569]  Why is it the president who, again, every time he makes a comment, every time he points out how they are lying in a weaponized way for their own political agenda, when he points out that they are not objective, that they're highly politicized and partisan, when he points that out, they go furious and they accuse him of being a tyrant who wants to shut down free speech.
[01:14:53.569 --> 01:14:54.789]  No, he has a bully pulpit.
[01:14:54.789 --> 01:14:56.210]  He has a right to speak as well.
[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:03.965]  And this other guy, Kyle Griffin, says the President calling for a journalist to be fired seems like a public threat to the First Amendment.
[01:15:03.965 --> 01:15:06.427]  See, that's where they're always coming with this.
[01:15:06.427 --> 01:15:10.210]  And it's like, no, you know, jelling him would be a threat to the First Amendment.
[01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:15.855]  Or maybe destroying his business as these people support with the gay wedding cake issue.
[01:15:15.855 --> 01:15:16.776]  Right?
[01:15:16.776 --> 01:15:18.778]  Who has free speech?
[01:15:18.778 --> 01:15:21.039]  Can you compel other people to do things that they don't want to do?
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:39.154]  See, when you jail people, or you shut down their businesses, but when you say, hey, this guy ought to be fired, or you ought to fire these players who are disrespecting the national anthem, the flag, veterans at these football games, that's just good business advice for these people.
[01:15:39.154 --> 01:15:40.175]  Advice that they won't take.
[01:15:40.175 --> 01:15:40.495]  Why?
[01:15:40.495 --> 01:15:44.539]  Because the NFL, just like the Washington Post, CNN, they're highly politicized.
[01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:46.640]  And they care more about their politics
[01:15:47.361 --> 01:15:48.702]  Then succeeding.
[01:15:48.702 --> 01:15:55.306]  They'll be willing to let the NFL burn down just like they'll burn down CNN and Washington Post and we'll be glad to see it.
[01:15:56.943 --> 01:15:59.545]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air, another Matt, go ahead.
[01:15:59.545 --> 01:16:14.098]  Yeah, hey listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[01:16:14.098 --> 01:16:20.984]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely
[01:16:21.144 --> 01:16:22.245]  Well, thank you.
[01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:27.170]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me.
[01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:30.133]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[01:16:30.133 --> 01:16:33.416]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[01:16:33.416 --> 01:16:39.562]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[01:16:39.562 --> 01:16:42.085]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[01:16:42.805 --> 01:16:49.655]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[01:16:49.655 --> 01:16:54.202]  That is the new shirt of the month, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:17:44.859 --> 01:17:46.279]  That means it's clean.
[01:17:46.279 --> 01:17:47.420]  That means it's pure.
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:50.300]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:53.101]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:18:05.524 --> 01:18:13.606]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:18:13.926 --> 01:18:18.789]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:18:18.789 --> 01:18:25.593]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:25.593 --> 01:18:32.777]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:18:32.777 --> 01:18:39.621]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:44.263]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:18:56.328 --> 01:19:03.872]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that
[01:19:05.467 --> 01:19:16.300]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:18.423]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:19:18.423 --> 01:19:22.427]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:22.427 --> 01:19:23.449]  I want to thank everybody that has.
[01:19:23.869 --> 01:19:32.055]  We've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine, and you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[01:19:32.055 --> 01:19:34.696]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[01:19:34.696 --> 01:19:37.498]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:19:37.498 --> 01:19:39.980]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:49.166]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[01:19:49.166 --> 01:19:53.609]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:19:59.414 --> 01:20:13.325]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:13.325 --> 01:20:15.867]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:20:15.867 --> 01:20:18.629]  It's time for you to choose a side.
[01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:20.951]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:23.996 --> 01:20:25.277]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.277 --> 01:20:28.039]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[01:20:28.039 --> 01:20:35.265]  We have a couple of sales I want to tell you about before we go back to the Pentagon, trying to figure out where all the money and troops went.
[01:20:35.265 --> 01:20:39.368]  They have lost trillions of dollars worth of money and 44,000 soldiers.
[01:20:39.368 --> 01:20:39.929]  Yeah, it's that bad.
[01:20:39.929 --> 01:20:41.970]  When you get government this size, here's the problem with Washington.
[01:20:49.690 --> 01:20:57.662]  When it has grown to the cancerous size that it is now, there's absolutely no way that anybody can control it.
[01:20:57.662 --> 01:20:58.303]  And we're seeing this.
[01:20:58.303 --> 01:20:59.726]  A good example, this is the Pentagon.
[01:21:01.002 --> 01:21:07.107]  How the purpose of government has been perverted and it is absolutely, totally unmanageable.
[01:21:07.107 --> 01:21:08.568]  Unmanageable.
[01:21:08.568 --> 01:21:12.091]  Before we get back to that though, I just want to remind you of some of the sales we have at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:21:12.091 --> 01:21:16.675]  We have DNA Force 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:21:16.675 --> 01:21:24.341]  This is an advanced formula designed to help energize mitochondrial function and sustain healthy cell cycles.
[01:21:24.341 --> 01:21:27.564]  Take a look at the research on BioPQQ.
[01:21:28.891 --> 01:21:35.397]  There's hundreds of clinical studies showing BioPQQ and how effective it is.
[01:21:35.397 --> 01:21:39.820]  That is why DNA Force is such an expensive product and so difficult to produce.
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:43.283]  And a 33% discount off of that is a massive savings.
[01:21:43.283 --> 01:21:45.405]  So take advantage of that right now.
[01:21:45.405 --> 01:21:48.988]  It is something, if you look at the studies, that is very important for your health.
[01:21:48.988 --> 01:21:52.311]  It can have a great deal of benefit for your health at any age.
[01:21:52.311 --> 01:21:54.093]  Also, Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix.
[01:21:54.693 --> 01:21:56.154]  It's been 50% off for a while.
[01:21:56.154 --> 01:22:00.659]  It is selling so quickly we're going to have to take this off in the next day or so.
[01:22:00.659 --> 01:22:04.062]  I'm not sure if this is the last day or if it's going to be ending at the beginning of the week.
[01:22:04.062 --> 01:22:06.044]  But it is now 50% off.
[01:22:06.044 --> 01:22:08.687]  It is our multivitamin and mineral formula.
[01:22:08.687 --> 01:22:09.848]  You can put it in a drink mix.
[01:22:09.848 --> 01:22:11.169]  It tastes great the way it is.
[01:22:11.169 --> 01:22:16.074]  Or you can add whatever you want to to conform to whatever your tastes are.
[01:22:16.674 --> 01:22:18.354]  And you don't have to swallow a lot of pills.
[01:22:18.354 --> 01:22:20.695]  That's what I like about Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix.
[01:22:20.695 --> 01:22:21.875]  Now 50% off.
[01:22:21.875 --> 01:22:25.636]  Finally, Super Blue Fluoride Free Products, 50% off.
[01:22:25.636 --> 01:22:28.137]  That's our toothpaste, our mouthwash.
[01:22:28.137 --> 01:22:30.417]  Again, it doesn't have fluoride, which can be harmful.
[01:22:30.417 --> 01:22:38.239]  If you look at the instructions on a typical fluoride toothpaste, it says, hey, if you swallow this stuff, contact poison control.
[01:22:38.239 --> 01:22:39.100]  We don't want to poison you.
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:40.240]  We've been trying to warn people.
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:46.022]  Uh, and give them water filters so they can filter out the fluoride that is put into the water source.
[01:22:46.022 --> 01:22:53.124]  Uh, there's been numerous studies showing how that's harmful, but iodine is actually very good, and it fights bacteria, along with nano-silver.
[01:22:53.124 --> 01:22:55.305]  I don't think you're going to find any other toothpaste anywhere.
[01:22:55.885 --> 01:22:57.206]  That has nanosilver.
[01:22:57.206 --> 01:23:01.348]  It's a great way to kill bacteria that cause gum disease.
[01:23:01.348 --> 01:23:06.551]  The gum disease causes tooth loss and it also causes heart disease.
[01:23:06.551 --> 01:23:11.273]  And super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a great tasting toothpaste.
[01:23:11.273 --> 01:23:13.034]  So try it now if you haven't tried it.
[01:23:13.034 --> 01:23:14.055]  It's 50% off.
[01:23:14.055 --> 01:23:14.875]  You don't have anything to lose.
[01:23:14.875 --> 01:23:18.317]  I guarantee that if you haven't tried this, you're going to love it.
[01:23:19.269 --> 01:23:22.231]  And if you have tried it and you love it, that's a great time to stock up on it.
[01:23:22.231 --> 01:23:27.836]  50% off, super blue, fluoride free, toothpaste products, mouthwash and so forth at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:29.097]  And we thank you for your support.
[01:23:29.097 --> 01:23:31.759]  Let's take a look at what's going on with the Pentagon.
[01:23:31.759 --> 01:23:38.664]  Again, one of the few legitimate uses of the federal government under the Constitution is to defend the country.
[01:23:38.664 --> 01:23:44.669]  But even that legitimate use can be abused if it is taken to extremes.
[01:23:44.669 --> 01:23:46.210]  And as Zero Hedge points out,
[01:23:47.705 --> 01:23:53.289]  The spirit of this country is totally adverse to a large military force.
[01:23:53.289 --> 01:23:54.630]  They didn't say that.
[01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:56.351]  Thomas Jefferson said that.
[01:23:56.351 --> 01:23:59.373]  He said that in a letter he wrote in 1807.
[01:23:59.373 --> 01:24:00.774]  But what do we have now?
[01:24:00.774 --> 01:24:05.357]  We have a global force to enforce the American empire.
[01:24:06.485 --> 01:24:18.433]  And as they point out, the United States has military personnel in nearly every country in the world, ranging from two liaison officers in Fiji to tens of thousands from all of the service branches in Japan and Germany, according to the report.
[01:24:18.433 --> 01:24:21.415]  Has it made us safer?
[01:24:21.415 --> 01:24:22.896]  I don't think so.
[01:24:22.896 --> 01:24:28.699]  When we are at war in seven different countries, I don't know how we continue to afford that.
[01:24:28.699 --> 01:24:30.320]  I don't know how that makes us safer.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.542]  I don't know how that makes us freer or more prosperous.
[01:24:34.497 --> 01:24:50.552]  And they say, but perhaps the most important and equally absurd part of this, as one considers the original beginnings of our humble republic, envisioned by people like Madison and Jefferson, is the fact that America's worldwide military presence is so big that the Pentagon itself can't track how many U.S.
[01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:53.054]  service members are deployed or where.
[01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:56.757]  This is something that is coming out of Stars and Stripes, the military newspaper.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:07.685]  And the headline, this is not the onion, the headline is, report, 44,000 unknown military personnel stationed around the world.
[01:25:07.685 --> 01:25:08.105]  So the U.S.
[01:25:08.105 --> 01:25:15.088]  military has more than 44,000 troops across the globe, the Pentagon claims it cannot track, according to a recent report, they are labeled as unknown.
[01:25:15.088 --> 01:25:20.691]  And again, this is not classified, it isn't like, we can't tell you where they are, they put down unknown.
[01:25:21.710 --> 01:25:24.738]  And so, Sergeant Tripes is saying, uh, what's going on here?
[01:25:24.738 --> 01:25:28.667]  So they, they asked some officers about this, and they said, um...
[01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:32.732]  Well, we're looking into it.
[01:25:32.732 --> 01:25:40.836]  They said in recent press conferences, they've said, well we have about 2,000 troops in Syria, but that was four times the previously acknowledged figure.
[01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:51.601]  So then an army spokesperson told reporters that 4,000 troops were deployed to Syria, after which he awkwardly walked back the statement less than 30 seconds later saying, I'm sorry, I misspoke there.
[01:25:51.601 --> 01:25:53.743]  There are approximately 500 in Syria.
[01:25:53.743 --> 01:25:54.283]  So what is it?
[01:25:54.283 --> 01:25:54.523]  Is it 2,000, 4,000, 500?
[01:25:57.045 --> 01:25:57.765]  They don't really know.
[01:25:57.765 --> 01:26:05.454]  An Army spokesman talking to Stars and Stripes said, our commitment is to be as transparent as we can within the constraints of operations security.
[01:26:05.454 --> 01:26:17.207]  But it's also the case, so it's not just classified stuff, it's also the case that the Pentagon acknowledged in a statement that it has no good way to track how many service members are stationed overseas.
[01:26:17.808 --> 01:26:22.151]  Where they are, and when they were there, according to Stars and Stripes.
[01:26:22.151 --> 01:26:28.376]  There is no one personnel system in the Defense Department that tracks the daily location of the personnel.
[01:26:28.376 --> 01:26:30.538]  So it isn't just, oh, it's classified.
[01:26:30.538 --> 01:26:31.799]  And so when I look at this,
[01:26:33.850 --> 01:26:36.434]  They're looking at the missing money.
[01:26:36.434 --> 01:26:41.922]  In 2015 alone, they had a staggering $6.5 trillion in funds unaccounted for out of their budget.
[01:26:41.922 --> 01:26:46.749]  $2.8 trillion of wrongful adjustments occurring in just one quarter.
[01:26:46.749 --> 01:26:47.951]  Somebody should show this report.
[01:26:48.874 --> 01:26:55.276]  To Bob Corker, who said he would not spend another penny, he would not allow the deficit to go up by one penny.
[01:26:55.276 --> 01:27:02.258]  Just remind him that we've got about nine, nine and a half trillion dollars missing here.
[01:27:02.258 --> 01:27:07.980]  So maybe if he wants to be Mr. Fiscal Hawk, maybe he should start looking at the Defense Department.
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:10.661]  But now look at these 44,000 soldiers and they don't know where they are.
[01:27:10.661 --> 01:27:15.663]  I mean, are they like marooned on a Japanese island or something since World War II?
[01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:16.243]  Where did they go?
[01:27:17.128 --> 01:27:21.470]  They don't know, because it's such a big bureaucracy, and that's the point.
[01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:25.772]  If you want to have better government, we're going to have to have smaller government.
[01:27:25.772 --> 01:27:30.074]  We're going to have to go back to a government that's the size of the Constitution.
[01:27:30.074 --> 01:27:37.717]  It isn't going to help us to have campaign spending limits or federal campaign finance.
[01:27:37.717 --> 01:27:44.760]  If you've got a black hole of power and money, you're going to draw the most corrupt people and programs into that.
[01:27:45.714 --> 01:27:47.896]  And there's nothing you're going to do to stop it.
[01:27:47.896 --> 01:27:50.298]  No reporting system, no system of prohibitions.
[01:27:50.298 --> 01:28:00.206]  When you're talking about tens of trillions of dollars to be had by any criminal who gets influence and peddling in Washington, D.C., it's going to happen.
[01:28:00.206 --> 01:28:02.107]  And no prohibition is going to stop it.
[01:28:02.107 --> 01:28:07.592]  The only prohibition that's going to stop it is to get the money and the power out of Washington and back to the people.
[01:28:07.592 --> 01:28:08.913]  To decentralize it.
[01:28:08.913 --> 01:28:10.814]  That was the original plan.
[01:28:10.814 --> 01:28:15.258]  The original plan was not to have us be an occupying force in every country in the world.
[01:28:16.107 --> 01:28:19.670]  The original plan was for America to not be an empire.
[01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:24.313]  The original plan was for citizens to have the ability
[01:28:25.410 --> 01:28:30.133]  The training to defend this country when and if that was necessary.
[01:28:30.133 --> 01:28:33.615]  And this is an absolute gargantuan distortion.
[01:28:33.615 --> 01:28:36.537]  It is like a metastasized cancer.
[01:28:36.537 --> 01:28:38.758]  And that is every aspect of our government.
[01:28:38.758 --> 01:28:40.699]  But of course, Pentagon especially.
[01:28:40.699 --> 01:28:46.002]  We see the National Defense Authorization Act always gets passed.
[01:28:46.002 --> 01:28:48.484]  And they'll put anything in there and get it passed.
[01:28:48.484 --> 01:28:53.027]  That's why you see so many corrupt things finding their way into the NDAA.
[01:28:53.027 --> 01:28:53.387]  Stay with us.
[01:28:53.387 --> 01:28:54.888]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[01:28:56.454 --> 01:29:01.938]  Maximize your potential and take your body back with super male vitality.
[01:29:01.938 --> 01:29:07.262]  We're breaking the conditioning and fighting back against the globalist war on male vitality.

[01:32:25.928 --> 01:32:34.653]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:32:34.653 --> 01:32:44.259]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[01:33:20.322 --> 01:33:26.950]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:28.632]  Welcome back.
[01:33:28.632 --> 01:33:33.959]  I'm David Knight, and we're going to be talking to Roger Stone, of course, an InfoWars contributor.
[01:33:33.959 --> 01:33:35.701]  You can find him on The War Room.
[01:33:36.445 --> 01:33:38.286]  Monday through Friday.
[01:33:38.286 --> 01:33:41.008]  That begins at 3 p.m.
[01:33:41.008 --> 01:33:42.148]  to 6 p.m.
[01:33:42.148 --> 01:33:45.610]  and Roger is on there pretty much every day, aren't you, Roger?
[01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:46.851]  I think for one hour.
[01:33:46.851 --> 01:33:51.854]  But I wanted to talk to Roger today about a couple of things that are happening because Roger always knows what's going on.
[01:33:51.854 --> 01:34:00.099]  The inside baseball in Washington and he wrote an article for Daily Caller talking about the time it's time for real net neutrality.
[01:34:00.099 --> 01:34:01.280]  You know, Roger, when I was talking about
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:18.385]  The news earlier, looking at the death threats to FCC Commissioner Pai, I mentioned the fact that they shut you down for nothing, and yet these are people saying, hey, we should sneak up behind him and inject him with bleach, we need to kill him, kill his family, all that stuff is left up there.
[01:34:18.385 --> 01:34:24.167]  They put this term up there, net neutrality, just like they had the Congressional Accountability Act.
[01:34:24.727 --> 01:34:30.535]  Which provided a $17 million slush fund to hide the sexual assaults of congressmen.
[01:34:30.535 --> 01:34:32.418]  We now have this thing called net neutrality.
[01:34:32.418 --> 01:34:37.946]  They always come up with these wonderful labels because that's the high ground for their arguments, isn't it?
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:42.604]  Yeah, no, it's as they say, Bass-ackward.
[01:34:42.604 --> 01:34:49.310]  It is ironic that they have grabbed the moral high ground in this argument.
[01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:51.232]  Let me try to break this down, David.
[01:34:51.232 --> 01:34:56.637]  The net neutrality rules passed under Barack Obama are anything but.
[01:34:57.139 --> 01:35:08.667]  The only neutrality that they provide for is for the ISPs, the service providers, Comcast, Verizon, AT&T.
[01:35:08.667 --> 01:35:11.990]  It guarantees their equal access and equal treatment.
[01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:18.397]  But it leaves untouched the Googles, the Facebooks, the Amazons, the Twitters.
[01:35:18.397 --> 01:35:26.606]  They're free to censor or defame conservative contributors to silence our voices entirely.
[01:35:26.606 --> 01:35:29.009]  Precisely what's happened in my own case.
[01:35:29.589 --> 01:35:48.269]  Now, I feel sorry for Ajit Pai, the FCC Commissioner, because every single day, even though I'm still not on Twitter, you will find threats to kill me, disfigure my wife, kill my children, kill my grandchildren, kill my dogs.
[01:35:48.269 --> 01:35:50.091]  Go back in time and kill everybody.
[01:35:51.552 --> 01:35:52.633]  All of your ancestors?
[01:35:52.633 --> 01:35:54.934]  Exactly, yeah.
[01:35:54.934 --> 01:35:57.215]  And those people are not banned.
[01:35:57.215 --> 01:36:00.417]  They are still very much on Twitter.
[01:36:00.417 --> 01:36:09.341]  So the new net neutrality rules provide for real protection of the First Amendment and free speech.
[01:36:09.341 --> 01:36:17.405]  So when you go online and you see liberals talking about net neutrality, that's the last thing they want.
[01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:29.350]  They want to continue to censor voices like Alex Jones or InfoWars, Breitbart, Daily Caller, Big League Politics.
[01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:32.691]  They are manipulating the algorithms.
[01:36:32.691 --> 01:36:36.993]  They're using a technique called shadow banning.
[01:36:36.993 --> 01:36:43.456]  They are attempting to provide us unequal access to this vibrant and important media.
[01:36:44.477 --> 01:36:47.440]  We just had Julian Assange tweet out today.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:56.088]  He said the AI revolution will not be televised because they will use AI to censor people's speech about what is going on.
[01:36:56.088 --> 01:36:56.929]  That's what we're now seeing.
[01:36:56.929 --> 01:36:59.572]  You're talking about the algorithms to censor people.
[01:36:59.572 --> 01:37:02.575]  And it's what we saw, what was it, two or three weeks ago?
[01:37:03.155 --> 01:37:12.783]  When you had the Twitter executive going before congressional testimony and giving congressional testimony, they said, wait a minute, we saw this story from InfoWars.
[01:37:12.783 --> 01:37:13.784]  Why was that there?
[01:37:13.784 --> 01:37:14.404]  Why wasn't that?
[01:37:14.404 --> 01:37:15.325]  Well, we took care of that.
[01:37:15.325 --> 01:37:15.786]  We took it down.
[01:37:15.786 --> 01:37:16.987]  Well, why did it take so long?
[01:37:16.987 --> 01:37:20.409]  Well, let's talk about that privately, Congressman.
[01:37:20.409 --> 01:37:21.490]  It's out in the open.
[01:37:21.490 --> 01:37:24.313]  They're talking about us and others by name.
[01:37:24.313 --> 01:37:26.194]  This is where the censorship is coming from.
[01:37:26.194 --> 01:37:29.277]  It's coming from the people who are pushing this so-called net neutrality.
[01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:39.854]  Thank goodness for the election of Donald Trump and the appointment and majority of commissioners at the FCC who understand this issue.
[01:37:39.854 --> 01:37:45.137]  We are going to strike a blow for freedom here very, very shortly.
[01:37:45.137 --> 01:37:48.559]  Yes, very important people understand where that is coming from.
[01:37:48.559 --> 01:37:57.503]  And what, you know, when we look at this, and we look at the cases being argued before the Supreme Court right now, that we've seen several of these where you have a
[01:37:58.499 --> 01:38:05.124]  Gay couple come in and say, we want a photographer or we want somebody who's doing a wedding to be at our wedding.
[01:38:05.124 --> 01:38:07.626]  And they say, no, I find that offensive.
[01:38:07.626 --> 01:38:09.267]  That's my personal choice not to do that.
[01:38:09.267 --> 01:38:10.809]  And they say, but you must do that.
[01:38:10.809 --> 01:38:11.969]  And yet they don't.
[01:38:11.969 --> 01:38:15.952]  Whatever you think about that particular case, why, if a small
[01:38:16.733 --> 01:38:22.315]  Company, an individual local baker or photographer must do this because they have a marketplace here.
[01:38:22.315 --> 01:38:30.457]  Why aren't those same rules being applied to these massive social media companies like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook or Google itself?
[01:38:30.457 --> 01:38:35.298]  Why aren't those same rules being applied to them when they have a de facto monopoly?
[01:38:35.298 --> 01:38:37.939]  Why shouldn't they have to evenly serve everybody?
[01:38:37.939 --> 01:38:40.380]  That's the question that I think anybody's asking.
[01:38:41.331 --> 01:38:47.376]  Well, it's time for these big internet companies to be regulated like a utility.
[01:38:47.376 --> 01:38:52.901]  I mean, AT&T is a private company, but you cannot be denied a telephone.
[01:38:52.901 --> 01:38:55.203]  Look, I'm for individual freedom.
[01:38:55.203 --> 01:38:57.945]  That's the right to marry anyone you want.
[01:38:57.945 --> 01:39:03.190]  It's also the right to either deliver the wedding cake or not deliver the wedding cake.
[01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:05.931]  Depending on your individual view.
[01:39:05.931 --> 01:39:09.331]  I owe both of these things equally.
[01:39:09.331 --> 01:39:15.873]  If we are for individual personal freedom, it must extend in this area as well.
[01:39:15.873 --> 01:39:21.274]  For too long, libertarian and conservative voices have been silenced on the internet.
[01:39:21.274 --> 01:39:31.256]  We have seen repeatedly the demonetization of YouTube videos by conservative commentators and voices like Alex Jones and others.
[01:39:32.056 --> 01:39:33.617]  Enough is enough.
[01:39:33.617 --> 01:39:39.939]  Donald Trump's election is going to allow us to grab back free access of the internet for everyone.
[01:39:39.939 --> 01:39:46.321]  By the way, under these rules, liberals and progressives could not be censored either.
[01:39:46.321 --> 01:39:49.882]  I'm for free speech for everyone, David.
[01:39:49.882 --> 01:39:50.222]  That's right.
[01:39:50.222 --> 01:39:57.425]  And when we see the mainstream media, as we have several times, it's almost a daily occurrence, we have some major story.
[01:39:57.865 --> 01:39:58.106]  We're good.
[01:40:16.389 --> 01:40:24.434]  President Trump's son was trying to get WikiLeaks information and it turns out that it had already been tweeted out a day earlier.
[01:40:24.434 --> 01:40:25.814]  Somebody sent him an email.
[01:40:25.814 --> 01:40:26.855]  He said, I hadn't even seen it.
[01:40:26.855 --> 01:40:28.836]  He said, people are sending me emails all the time.
[01:40:28.836 --> 01:40:36.940]  But when they put this stuff out and President Trump exposes it and criticizes them for these false attacks, they always accuse him of censorship.
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:37.681]  It's not censorship.
[01:40:38.766 --> 01:40:40.269]  Yeah, no, look, it's laughable.
[01:40:40.269 --> 01:40:43.276]  The hypocrisy of the left is extraordinary.
[01:40:43.276 --> 01:40:48.347]  You will remember when Alex Jones and I first raised the questions about Hillary Clinton's health.
[01:40:49.682 --> 01:40:52.203]  This wasn't based on something we'd seen online.
[01:40:52.203 --> 01:40:55.243]  This was based on our own two eyes.
[01:40:55.243 --> 01:40:57.364]  You could see her coughing fits.
[01:40:57.364 --> 01:41:02.825]  Based on her two eyes as well, because they were going in different directions at certain times, right?
[01:41:02.825 --> 01:41:05.806]  She needed help to get up one flight of stairs.
[01:41:05.806 --> 01:41:07.986]  Now suddenly, that was off-limits.
[01:41:07.986 --> 01:41:09.647]  We were denounced.
[01:41:09.647 --> 01:41:12.787]  The Clinton campaign attacked Alex by name.
[01:41:12.787 --> 01:41:16.128]  They put out a written statement accusing me of making the whole thing up.
[01:41:16.688 --> 01:41:23.131]  Now, however, you see the mainstream media viciously attacking Donald Trump over his health.
[01:41:23.131 --> 01:41:24.792]  Oh, he's sick.
[01:41:24.792 --> 01:41:25.773]  He's not well.
[01:41:25.773 --> 01:41:26.713]  He's crazy.
[01:41:26.713 --> 01:41:28.134]  He's non-encompassmentist.
[01:41:28.513 --> 01:41:30.174]  That's perfectly alright.
[01:41:30.174 --> 01:41:32.576]  Look, this is laughable.
[01:41:32.576 --> 01:41:36.539]  I predicted this on the Alex Jones Show months ago.
[01:41:36.539 --> 01:41:53.992]  If Mueller shoots and misses, which I think he certainly shoots, how that plays out we don't know, then they will move to the 25th Amendment strategy, removing Donald Trump because he's quote-unquote crazy, which he most certainly is not.
[01:41:54.692 --> 01:42:09.862]  But you see Senator Corker, you see Don Lamone from CNN, you see all these voices, more and more, Teith Olbermann, although I don't know how he tweets from a straitjacket, must be interesting.
[01:42:09.862 --> 01:42:19.248]  You know, this whole idea that Trump is not mentally well, that's perfectly acceptable commentary, but when we criticized Hillary's
[01:42:19.918 --> 01:42:22.861]  Obviously frail health, while we were bully boys.
[01:42:36.573 --> 01:42:43.774]  Want to ask Roger Stone about a column that he had about the bad advice that President Trump is getting from his lawyers.
[01:42:43.774 --> 01:42:52.076]  Also want to ask him about the reports that retired CIA agents working with Blackwater founder claimed that the that H.R.
[01:42:52.076 --> 01:42:55.337]  McMaster approved the spy job on the Trump family.
[01:42:55.337 --> 01:42:55.937]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:55.937 --> 01:43:02.158]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.

[01:43:30.211 --> 01:43:34.493]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy,
[01:43:34.773 --> 01:43:37.476]  Weight gain and overall brain fog.
[01:43:37.476 --> 01:43:43.704]  Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.

[01:43:58.491 --> 01:44:07.618]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:44:07.618 --> 01:44:08.999]  So what do we do about it?
[01:44:08.999 --> 01:44:12.141]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.

[01:45:05.674 --> 01:45:14.078]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:45:14.078 --> 01:45:18.960]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:45:47.805 --> 01:45:53.506]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:45:53.506 --> 01:45:58.187]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but
[01:46:12.270 --> 01:46:19.857]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:46:19.857 --> 01:46:26.243]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:46:26.243 --> 01:46:27.544]  These are all parasites.
[01:46:27.544 --> 01:46:28.645]  Tell us about all the stuff it says.
[01:46:28.645 --> 01:46:29.706]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:46:29.986 --> 01:46:34.487]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:46:34.487 --> 01:46:37.628]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:46:37.628 --> 01:46:40.789]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:46:40.789 --> 01:46:41.869]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:46:41.869 --> 01:46:43.810]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:46:43.810 --> 01:46:44.830]  And folks, you can't lose.

[01:46:50.792 --> 01:46:53.032]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:46:53.032 --> 01:46:54.993]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:46:58.863 --> 01:47:07.825]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:07.825 --> 01:47:12.547]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:27.049 --> 01:47:29.612]  Welcome back, I'm David Knight and we're talking to Roger Stone.
[01:47:29.612 --> 01:47:36.779]  We're going to ask Roger about this tweet that President Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, took credit for.
[01:47:36.779 --> 01:47:38.241]  It was a mea culpa.
[01:47:38.241 --> 01:47:40.923]  It was a head-scratcher at the very least.
[01:47:40.923 --> 01:47:43.066]  It really got the left fired up.
[01:47:43.066 --> 01:47:48.611]  It's another one of these nothing-burgers that they thought they really had something, but it certainly got them talking.
[01:47:49.332 --> 01:47:55.857]  And the fact that he would word something like that imprecisely and then take credit for saying, I had control of the tweets.
[01:47:55.857 --> 01:47:57.538]  We're going to talk to Roger about that.
[01:47:57.538 --> 01:48:02.202]  Before we do, real quickly, I'll remind you of some of the items that we have on sale at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:48:02.202 --> 01:48:05.804]  We have DNA Force now 33% off at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:48:53.703 --> 01:49:00.326]  Roger, you've been saying that this tweet that went out saying I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.
[01:49:00.326 --> 01:49:03.908]  That was then used by the left to say, look, this is obstruction of justice.
[01:49:03.908 --> 01:49:06.309]  He fired Comey because of this.
[01:49:06.309 --> 01:49:09.770]  And then the attorney, his attorney John Dowd, came out and said, well, I wrote that.
[01:49:09.770 --> 01:49:10.751]  It was sloppy.
[01:49:10.751 --> 01:49:11.791]  It was very inaccurate.
[01:49:11.791 --> 01:49:15.053]  I mean, what do you think about his lawyers here?
[01:49:18.727 --> 01:49:23.191]  I think the president's lawyers are giving him incredibly bad advice.
[01:49:23.191 --> 01:49:33.580]  I really don't think they understand the enmity of the deep state and the two party elite duopoly that have run this country into the ground.
[01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:37.303]  They have every intention of removing our president.
[01:49:38.247 --> 01:49:54.531]  It is unrealistic for Ty Cobb, a lawyer who obviously stole his name from a baseball player, to tell the president that he will shortly have a letter from Mueller clearing him entirely on the question of Russian collusion.
[01:49:54.531 --> 01:49:58.593]  I'm telling you, that isn't going to happen.
[01:49:58.593 --> 01:50:03.614]  Instead, I believe the president's lawyers are sleepwalking him right into the blade.
[01:50:05.413 --> 01:50:07.215]  This is an extraordinary mistake.
[01:50:07.215 --> 01:50:12.401]  The president needs to take the Mueller inquiry more seriously.
[01:50:12.401 --> 01:50:21.712]  This is a completely partisan get Trump effort that is not going to stop and that tweet
[01:50:22.699 --> 01:50:28.744]  At least on the face of it, appears to set the President up for an obstruction charge.
[01:50:28.744 --> 01:50:35.349]  Remember, previously he told us that Flynn was fired because he lied to the Vice President.
[01:50:35.349 --> 01:50:41.133]  Now he's suddenly saying no, Flynn was fired because he lied to the FBI.
[01:50:41.133 --> 01:50:51.341]  That would of course mean that when he told Comey to end the Flynn investigation, he was arguably guilty of obstruction.
[01:50:52.311 --> 01:50:58.560]  So then John Dowd dives on the grenade and says, no, the president didn't send that, I sent it.
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:02.185]  This is not only sloppy, but I think it's dangerous.
[01:51:02.185 --> 01:51:04.248]  The president needs to get real.
[01:51:04.248 --> 01:51:08.915]  As I said in the first segment, I'm convinced that if Mueller shoots
[01:51:09.965 --> 01:51:22.597]  And Mrs. that they will then move to a 25th Amendment strategy, removing Trump because they claim he is non-compos mentis, that he is crazy around the Ben.
[01:51:22.597 --> 01:51:23.798]  I've talked to the president.
[01:51:23.798 --> 01:51:27.041]  He's just as sharp as he's ever been.
[01:51:27.041 --> 01:51:33.788]  This is a false narrative being promulgated mostly by the talking heads on CNN, but
[01:51:34.702 --> 01:51:41.928]  The political establishment will never rest until they can negate the results of the last election.
[01:51:41.928 --> 01:51:44.110]  That's what this is really about.
[01:51:44.110 --> 01:51:53.518]  And you are not doing the president a service by telling him that he's about to be cleared when, in my opinion, he is not.
[01:51:53.518 --> 01:51:55.119]  Now, the Drudge Report
[01:51:55.842 --> 01:52:03.109]  Picked up my interview with the New York Daily News on this subject last week, for which I am gratified.
[01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:10.396]  But I think it's very important that the President's supporters and the President's friends tell him the truth.
[01:52:10.396 --> 01:52:14.200]  That his lawyers are leading him down the primrose path.
[01:52:14.710 --> 01:52:16.211]  To the gallows.
[01:52:16.211 --> 01:52:20.052]  I believe that with my entire heart and soul.
[01:52:20.052 --> 01:52:27.015]  And I am deeply, deeply concerned that they are not taking the Mueller inquiry seriously enough.
[01:52:27.015 --> 01:52:32.297]  You know, I think probably his best defender, maybe he needs to get rid of these guys and hire Alan Dershowitz.
[01:52:32.297 --> 01:52:33.578]  You know, he wrote a book called Trumped Up.
[01:52:33.578 --> 01:52:35.018]  He said, there's nothing here.
[01:52:35.018 --> 01:52:36.099]  There isn't any crime.
[01:52:36.099 --> 01:52:37.539]  He can fire the FBI director.
[01:52:37.539 --> 01:52:41.321]  The FBI director works for him under the Justice Department.
[01:52:41.901 --> 01:52:49.126]  And he said, and so has Judge Napolitano, he says, look, it's not obstruction if you're not trying to hide something that is criminal.
[01:52:49.126 --> 01:52:50.668]  There is no crime here!
[01:52:50.668 --> 01:53:04.658]  And so the only thing you can say is, hey, I don't like, I want you to go spend your time trying to find criminals and terrorists who are trying to do things here in the United States instead of going down this rabbit trail with this.
[01:53:04.658 --> 01:53:06.099]  That'd be perfectly legitimate to do.
[01:53:06.839 --> 01:53:14.443]  And if you feel like the guy is wasting resources on a political witch hunt, it'd be perfectly fine to shut that down as well.
[01:53:14.443 --> 01:53:27.249]  Because if this isn't about a crime, if Comey and Mueller and the rest of these people, Rod Rosenstein, if this is a political persecution looking to get something on Trump and others with a process crime, it'd be perfectly fine to shut that down.
[01:53:27.249 --> 01:53:28.930]  There's absolutely no reason that you couldn't do that.
[01:53:30.086 --> 01:53:42.275]  Well, it's obvious from the President's tweets and some of his public comments that his lawyers have convinced him that it's somehow improper for him to give direction to the Justice Department.
[01:53:42.275 --> 01:53:43.095]  That's false.
[01:53:43.095 --> 01:53:46.898]  The Justice Department is an extension of the executive branch.
[01:53:46.898 --> 01:53:52.042]  The President has every right to give direct orders to Jeff Sessions.
[01:53:52.042 --> 01:53:57.826]  Now, I personally am opposed to the idea of firing Mueller, although he certainly merits it.
[01:53:58.366 --> 01:54:05.894]  Because of the obvious mainstream media analogy to the Saturday Night Massacre and Richard Nixon.
[01:54:05.894 --> 01:54:07.896]  It's unnecessary, David.
[01:54:07.896 --> 01:54:10.878]  The President needs to direct Jeff Sessions.
[01:54:10.878 --> 01:54:13.141]  Give him a direct order.
[01:54:13.141 --> 01:54:17.385]  Appoint a special prosecutor in the matter of Uranium One.
[01:54:18.078 --> 01:54:34.564]  That would immediately entail a federal investigation of Mr. Mueller, the former FBI Director, Mr. Comey, the former FBI Director, Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, and the supervising U.S.
[01:54:34.564 --> 01:54:38.786]  Attorney in the Uranium One matter, Rod Rosenstein.
[01:54:38.786 --> 01:54:39.606]  That's right, the whole group.
[01:54:40.521 --> 01:54:55.280]  If those four gentlemen are under federal investigation by a special prosecutor, say Andrew McCarthy or Judge Andrew Napolitano or Trey Gowdy or some other honest broker, well, they cannot possibly
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:55:03.823]  continue to function in this get Trump brigade that is the special counsel.
[01:55:03.823 --> 01:55:20.670]  It is interesting that as soon as I proposed this, within minutes, literally, Vanity Fair and Raw Story, the worst of the worst left-wing fake news sites, were out with stories saying why the president should not and could not do this.
[01:55:20.670 --> 01:55:24.112]  That's how I know it's exactly the right thing to do.
[01:55:24.372 --> 01:55:25.833]  Oh, I think that would be a genius move.
[01:55:25.833 --> 01:55:35.801]  Because, again, he doesn't have to make it look as if they're going to argue obstruction if he tries to fire Mueller even though he has the authority, even though there isn't any special prosecutor law.
[01:55:35.801 --> 01:55:38.443]  That was allowed to expire in 1999.
[01:55:38.443 --> 01:55:42.806]  We don't even know the rules under which the special prosecutor is operating because there is no law.
[01:55:42.806 --> 01:55:45.268]  And so there isn't any process.
[01:55:45.268 --> 01:55:46.329]  Actually, David, we do know.
[01:55:46.329 --> 01:55:48.871]  He's operating under no rules whatsoever.
[01:55:48.871 --> 01:55:49.291]  That's right.
[01:55:49.291 --> 01:55:50.272]  Yeah, they won't declare it.
[01:55:50.272 --> 01:55:50.412]  Yeah.
[01:55:51.033 --> 01:55:59.357]  Under the old special prosecutor law, expanding the scope of his probe requires the written permission of the Attorney General.
[01:55:59.357 --> 01:56:01.678]  This guy does anything he wants.
[01:56:01.678 --> 01:56:02.719]  That's right.
[01:56:02.719 --> 01:56:04.940]  And there was oversight by three judges and so forth.
[01:56:04.940 --> 01:56:06.520]  None of that stuff applies anymore.
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:07.681]  He just does whatever he wishes.
[01:56:08.610 --> 01:56:22.747]  And the most chilling piece of information this week is the fact that a special prosecutor has subpoenaed the Deutsches Bank records into the $300 million portfolio of real estate developments by Donald Trump.
[01:56:23.317 --> 01:56:23.537]  Yes.
[01:56:23.537 --> 01:56:26.098]  What does this have to do with Russian collusion?
[01:56:26.098 --> 01:56:27.719]  Nothing whatsoever.
[01:56:27.719 --> 01:56:29.019]  It's a witch hunt.
[01:56:29.019 --> 01:56:35.282]  It's time for Mr. Mueller and Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe and Mr. Rosenstein.
[01:56:35.282 --> 01:56:38.623]  It's their time in the barrel, so to speak.
[01:56:38.623 --> 01:56:48.767]  If you want to get a process crime against somebody, the easiest way to do it, first of all, is to have a surprise deposition on them and say, oh, you lied on some of the details as to what they did to Flynn.
[01:56:48.767 --> 01:56:50.968]  But the next easiest thing to do is financial crimes.
[01:56:51.508 --> 01:56:57.390]  Because it is so complex and there's so many different rules and regulations and it's subject to interpretations.
[01:56:57.390 --> 01:57:05.732]  Anybody who has looked at the IRS rules know it is far more complicated with these international rules and that's ultimately what they're after.
[01:57:05.732 --> 01:57:10.034]  I think your strategy is exactly what needs to happen, Roger Stone.
[01:57:10.034 --> 01:57:13.835]  The idea that they would start to investigate Uranium One, which is
[01:57:14.235 --> 01:57:20.223]  We're all of these people running this thing without any oversight, without any rules, without any law.
[01:57:20.223 --> 01:57:22.606]  They were all involved in Uranium One.
[01:57:22.606 --> 01:57:24.088]  Well, that's it for today's broadcast.
[01:57:24.088 --> 01:57:25.790]  Thank you again, Roger, for joining us.
[01:57:25.790 --> 01:57:26.671]  I'm David Knight.

[01:58:50.460 --> 01:59:05.095]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[01:59:05.095 --> 01:59:12.582]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[01:59:12.722 --> 01:59:13.182]  Well, thank you.
[01:59:13.182 --> 01:59:18.128]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread On Me, but instead it says Won't Tread On Me.
[01:59:18.128 --> 01:59:21.051]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[01:59:21.051 --> 01:59:24.334]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[01:59:24.334 --> 01:59:30.581]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[01:59:30.581 --> 01:59:33.003]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[01:59:33.744 --> 01:59:40.588]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[01:59:40.588 --> 01:59:49.293]  That is the new Shard of the Mind, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
