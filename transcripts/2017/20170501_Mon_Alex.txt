[00:00:07.976 --> 00:00:08.336]  It's May Day.
[00:00:09.837 --> 00:00:15.079]  The Deep State's been publicly exposed to shadow government, thanks to valiant patriots in and outside of the government.
[00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:17.780]  But ABC News claims the Deep State doesn't exist.
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.682]  Isn't that just amazing?
[00:00:21.702 --> 00:00:31.526]  ABC News recently broadcast pure propaganda to all of its supposed sheep viewers about the recent mass use of the mysterious term, Deep State.
[00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:37.288]  The Deep State is the notion that there is a network of career government employees
[00:00:37.568 --> 00:00:40.729]  Who are secretly manipulating government policy.
[00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.952]  They could have positions in the military, intelligence agencies, or other areas of government.
[00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:56.697]  Supporters of President Donald Trump point to leaks from career bureaucrats who they say are undermining his agenda.
[00:00:57.037 --> 00:01:05.404]  Many write the Deep State off as a conspiracy theory because no evidence of an organized effort has surfaced.
[00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:13.451]  The phrase was originally used to refer to power dynamics in foreign countries like the former Soviet Union.
[00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:22.298]  The term began gaining traction during the 2016 presidential race and became prominent after Trump's election.
[00:01:22.558 --> 00:01:25.961]  Perhaps ABC News, if it wasn't a CI operation itself,
[00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:28.744]  Should have dug a little further into their archives.
[00:01:28.904 --> 00:01:31.466]  The evolution of the deep state reads like a U.S.
[00:01:31.526 --> 00:01:32.427]  history book.
[00:01:32.547 --> 00:01:37.872]  In 1947, Harry S. Truman created the CIA by signing the National Security Act.
[00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:46.440]  Founding members of the CIA included Skull and Bones member Prescott Bush and the dynamic duo Allen Dulles and John Foster Dulles.
[00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:50.224]  Hastily, the Office of Policy Coordination was formed in 1948.
[00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:52.486]  Radio Free Europe in 1949.
[00:01:53.027 --> 00:02:02.799]  Operation Mockingbird in the 1950s, where at least 25 media organizations and 400 journalists immediately became CIA assets.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.304]  MKULTRA, mind control operations, began around 1953.
[00:02:08.906 --> 00:02:33.515]  ...the 1961 Deep State coup of our executive branch as Allen Dulles led the Operation Mongoose fiasco resulting in the Bay of Pigs that nearly annihilated the United States, the JFK assassination, which we will know more about the Deep State's actual involvement as the 25th anniversary allows secret documents to be released in October of this year, the false Gulf of Tonkin narrative,
[00:02:33.615 --> 00:02:37.820]  The murder of over 20,000 Vietnamese civilians in Operation Phoenix.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.505]  Operation Chaos, which tracked thousands of protesters and organizations.
[00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:44.147]  The Iran-Contra Affair.
[00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:50.254]  The weapons of mass destruction lies to get us into the Iraq War and the deconstruction of the Middle East.
[00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:52.837]  And that is merely scratching the surface.
[00:02:52.857 --> 00:02:53.677]  It would be easier.
[00:02:54.358 --> 00:02:58.399]  If it were a conspiracy you're describing, but that's not the case, is it?
[00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.200]  This is something that hides in plain sight.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:11.663]  It's kind of a natural evolution when so much money and political control is at stake in the most powerful country in the world.
[00:03:12.123 --> 00:03:14.024]  This has evolved over time.
[00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:17.969]  It's all the national security functions of the government.
[00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:19.051]  It's the Pentagon.
[00:03:19.111 --> 00:03:21.194]  It's Homeland Security.
[00:03:21.374 --> 00:03:22.756]  It's the State Department.
[00:03:23.617 --> 00:03:29.305]  It's also Treasury because they have a kind of symbiotic relationship with Wall Street.
[00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:36.967]  And here we are in 2017 as the Deep State draws China and Russia into a great war over Syria and North Korea.
[00:03:37.127 --> 00:03:43.548]  Meanwhile, the continuity of government plan ensures that the Deep State will keep rolling on as U.S.
[00:03:43.628 --> 00:03:47.409]  citizens are decimated due to one catastrophe or another.
[00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.910]  So you see, the Deep State actually isn't a hidden organization or a conspiracy theory.
[00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:08.101]  It is a taxpayer-funded factory of death and subversion, producing the elite initiatives of the banker Wall Street class, carried out by a group of well-known federal organizations that have officially molded U.S.
[00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:14.126]  history for the past 70 years by acting further and further outside of the U.S.
[00:04:14.206 --> 00:04:16.208]  Constitution as time goes by.
[00:04:16.468 --> 00:04:26.997]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:04:27.578 --> 00:04:31.802]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[00:04:32.782 --> 00:04:42.391]  And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning.
[00:04:43.163 --> 00:04:46.326]  To the very limits of official censorship and concealment.
[00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:49.889]  So, who is pushing the conspiracy theory now?
[00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.951]  American broadcasting company?
[00:04:52.212 --> 00:04:54.554]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:04:55.655 --> 00:04:57.336]  Ladies and gentlemen, get ready.
[00:04:57.396 --> 00:05:01.260]  I'm back in studio, live, ready to transmit worldwide.
[00:05:06.474 --> 00:05:07.814]  This is where you get breaking news.
[00:05:08.214 --> 00:05:11.135]  McMaster has a plan to send in ground troops to Syria.
[00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:15.556]  That story actually broke here on InfoWars four or five days ago.
[00:05:15.576 --> 00:05:16.576]  Bloomberg is covering it.
[00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:25.078]  So essentially whatever you're reading in the news today or tomorrow, this is all going to be on InfoWars five, ten, fifteen days before it ever reaches the mainstream.
[00:05:25.098 --> 00:05:27.518]  That is how good the sourcing is here.
[00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:28.498]  This is for real news.
[00:05:28.698 --> 00:05:31.719]  That is why not only are they trying to divide the base against Trump,
[00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.283]  They are now slandering Alex and me and other patriots, calling us Russian agents.
[00:05:37.423 --> 00:05:44.710]  They realize that this is the only place for real news and now they're trying to attack and lie about us and claiming that we're Russian agents and all that.
[00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.252]  We don't want to sit here and brag and say we're right, we're right, we're right.
[00:05:47.332 --> 00:05:49.474]  They keep saying we're lying, we're lying, we're lying because
[00:05:50.294 --> 00:05:53.836]  Weeks ago, and then last week, we said, no, McMaster wants the troops.
[00:05:53.876 --> 00:05:55.597]  That's my source from the White House.
[00:05:55.637 --> 00:05:56.478]  Then you have your source.
[00:05:56.878 --> 00:05:58.239]  He wants 150,000 on the ground.
[00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:11.286]  Now Bloomberg comes out today and says Trump has told Bloomberg, I don't want a war, but it turns out the aides were doing exactly what we said, trying to jockey and get them in place and move artillery in that wasn't for ISIS, but was for Assad.
[00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:12.566]  Exactly.
[00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:15.609]  So Bloomberg is now reporting what we covered a week ago.
[00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:22.113]  And one thing that frustrates me a little bit is the idea that we need Bloomberg to validate our reporting.
[00:06:22.193 --> 00:06:23.234]  Because this is real news.
[00:06:23.274 --> 00:06:26.076]  We don't make stuff up like ABC does, like Bloomberg does.
[00:06:26.096 --> 00:06:27.296]  They fabricate things.
[00:06:27.336 --> 00:06:29.698]  I put a transcript out of what the president said on Monday.
[00:06:29.778 --> 00:06:32.020]  It's what the president said, and I'm not going to say where it came from.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.501]  Everybody knows we have contact with the President.
[00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:37.243]  The media is attacking that, saying, oh look, Alex is making this up.
[00:06:37.523 --> 00:06:37.723]  What?
[00:06:37.863 --> 00:06:38.343]  I said it?
[00:06:38.603 --> 00:06:41.345]  It came out three days later, out of his mouth, the exact same words.
[00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:49.430]  And they are so desperate for war now that they're trying to claim that us, by trying to oppose a ground war in Syria, trying to save American lives.
[00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.651]  I mean, Alex, when I did that live stream, 11 hours,
[00:06:53.832 --> 00:06:56.814]  So many mothers called in and said, my son has PTSD.
[00:06:56.874 --> 00:06:57.734]  This is so sad.
[00:06:58.175 --> 00:06:59.195]  You know, it was heartbreaking.
[00:06:59.235 --> 00:07:01.536]  I could hardly even stay on the line.
[00:07:01.556 --> 00:07:02.217]  It was so sad.
[00:07:02.717 --> 00:07:04.618]  Moms do not want to do another war.
[00:07:04.638 --> 00:07:06.579]  They do not want the McMaster plan to go through.
[00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:07.360]  Exactly.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.540]  And again, we love our military.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.541]  We criticize the wars.
[00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:12.923]  It's because it's not for our national sovereignty.
[00:07:12.943 --> 00:07:13.783]  It's not for our interests.
[00:07:13.883 --> 00:07:17.105]  This is one of the most elite publications published by the Rothschilds.
[00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.126]  I mean, you can't make that up.
[00:07:19.261 --> 00:07:23.583]  And they literally say, we're dupe idiots, and Assad tells us what to say.
[00:07:23.863 --> 00:07:27.104]  So now it's not just we're dupes of Putin, now it's Assad.
[00:07:27.165 --> 00:07:27.425]  No, no, no.
[00:07:27.665 --> 00:07:29.706]  We said first on Wednesday, false flag.
[00:07:30.026 --> 00:07:31.767]  We have the articles, the history, all of it.
[00:07:31.807 --> 00:07:32.447]  You did as well.
[00:07:32.947 --> 00:07:34.668]  Then, over the next week and a half,
[00:07:35.348 --> 00:07:39.110]  Everybody else from Putin to Ron Paul, everybody else came out and said it was a false flag.
[00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.831]  Again, we're the progenitors.
[00:07:41.172 --> 00:07:48.516]  We're not here grabbing it, you know, from Assad how a pair of self-publicists wound up as apologists for Assad.
[00:07:48.776 --> 00:07:50.437]  We're not apologizing for Assad.
[00:07:50.617 --> 00:07:52.659]  He didn't start the Civil War six years ago.
[00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:54.059]  He's never done anything to us.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.200]  I mean, this is so crazy.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:01.284]  Everything we say has just docked because we're going off what's already there and the sources we have.
[00:08:10.035 --> 00:08:26.366]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:08:26.827 --> 00:08:38.355]  This morning, I was talking to one of my friends, and he said to me, he said, Alex, man, InfoWars is going to be shut down soon.
[00:08:39.482 --> 00:08:45.307]  While your traffic's down 85% and you don't have any audience, everybody's turning against you.
[00:08:46.788 --> 00:08:49.490]  And I asked him, I said, where'd you get that information?
[00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.894]  He said, oh, I saw it on Infowars.com being spammed in the comments.
[00:08:54.214 --> 00:09:01.840]  And I looked at my friend, who I've known for more than a decade, and I said, well, you know that's part of a PR campaign of disinformation, right?
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.462]  He looked at me and he said, is it really?
[00:09:04.482 --> 00:09:08.766]  I mean, they attack you every day on every major news channel.
[00:09:09.804 --> 00:09:25.673]  Almost every night on the late night shows, from Jimmy Kimmel to Stephen Colbert, you're on CNN or MSNBC every night saying you're fake news, saying you're a liar, saying you're an actor, saying you're a fraud.
[00:09:26.314 --> 00:09:27.715]  How could you survive that?
[00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:32.958]  And I looked at him and I said, we're bigger than we've ever been.
[00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:36.620]  We have more traffic.
[00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:48.074]  More people, more affiliates, more listeners, and more revenue than InfoWars has ever had in 22 years.
[00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:56.221]  And my friend looked at me like I was a liar and said, we'll see.
[00:10:01.686 --> 00:10:04.869]  And if you can understand that statement,
[00:10:06.408 --> 00:10:09.771]  You can understand everything in this world today.
[00:10:10.272 --> 00:10:16.437]  There are people that believe mainstream media and believe the hype, and there are people that don't.
[00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:23.324]  But if mainstream media can get enough people to believe something,
[00:10:24.761 --> 00:10:28.423]  And get enough people to buy into it, then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:10:28.463 --> 00:10:35.906]  I got a call from a New York Times writer, a very prominent writer last night, wanted to talk to me.
[00:10:36.787 --> 00:10:40.689]  And I've known him for about 16, 17 years, so I called him back.
[00:10:41.909 --> 00:10:49.433]  And they said, listen, I don't agree with your politics, but it's clear the Chobani yogurt lawsuit and the Democrats trying to get
[00:10:51.690 --> 00:11:07.354]  The pizza place to sue you there in DC and the media saying you're fake news and the one-sided coverage on your custody battle for your children and all the major news channels attacking you that they're trying to shut you down.
[00:11:08.614 --> 00:11:10.435]  And I said, do you think I need to be shut down?
[00:11:12.035 --> 00:11:14.956]  And they said, no, if you stop bashing the Muslims,
[00:11:16.869 --> 00:11:18.529]  Who are nice, peaceful people.
[00:11:18.589 --> 00:11:19.670]  You don't need to be shut down.
[00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.770]  And I said, oh, is that a message?
[00:11:24.591 --> 00:11:25.731]  And the person was silent.
[00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:31.472]  So here's what's happening.
[00:11:31.492 --> 00:11:32.812]  99% of people are followers.
[00:11:33.712 --> 00:11:35.313]  Most people act like they're leaders.
[00:11:37.293 --> 00:11:45.195]  But a leader does what's right, regardless of what happens to them individually, for the greater good of the species.
[00:11:47.461 --> 00:12:00.108]  Don't get confused by that and think that means we're collectivists and just give ourselves over to some slave master that directs us around for the greater good.
[00:12:00.308 --> 00:12:03.670]  We're not a beehive or an ant hill, an ant colony.
[00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:14.336]  But what I'm going through is no longer a microcosm, but it is on a smaller scale to what's happening to President Trump.
[00:12:15.615 --> 00:12:16.975]  And it's a beta test.
[00:12:17.115 --> 00:12:18.456]  I've been picked for the test.
[00:12:22.296 --> 00:12:24.797]  The test pilot of the Globalist.
[00:12:24.837 --> 00:12:28.418]  I don't work for them, don't like them, but they've chosen me as the test pilot.
[00:12:29.918 --> 00:12:32.619]  I'm like the chimp they fire up into space to see what happens to me.
[00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:35.739]  To test the news wars.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:43.161]  The Pentagon, the CIA, the Broadcast Board of Governors of the FCC having congressional meetings.
[00:12:44.716 --> 00:12:53.079]  And saying, we're gearing up to take out Alex Jones and other fake news, and we say we can do that because they work for the Russians.
[00:12:53.499 --> 00:12:56.540]  So I've now been dehumanized and I'm a foreign spy, see?
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:03.923]  With no evidence, no jury, never get to face my accuser, never get to respond on the news, don't get to go before the Congress at a hearing.
[00:13:05.883 --> 00:13:10.365]  They were calling real reds in front of the House on American activities.
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.180]  Committee.
[00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:16.163]  Some were innocent, some weren't, but at least they got to face their accuser.
[00:13:17.324 --> 00:13:19.485]  Not in the 1984 scenario of 2017.
[00:13:19.525 --> 00:13:23.167]  So I'm a Russian spy, they say.
[00:13:23.227 --> 00:13:24.028]  I'm a racist.
[00:13:25.209 --> 00:13:26.209]  I'm a homophobe.
[00:13:26.429 --> 00:13:28.431]  I'm just, you name it, I hate women!
[00:13:28.851 --> 00:13:30.812]  You don't see any proof of that, but they don't care!
[00:13:31.132 --> 00:13:32.093]  That's what they say!
[00:13:33.334 --> 00:13:37.697]  And that's the accepted, kosher,
[00:13:39.002 --> 00:14:02.566]  The politically correct thing to do, whether it's in a civil trial for your children, or whether it's on the news, is you sit there and you can't talk, and the mainstream media, the Rachel Maddows, the Colberts, the lawyers, whoever it is, they point at you, and they say, that's a person who doesn't think women should be able to be judges.
[00:14:03.006 --> 00:14:04.187]  That's a person that's racist.
[00:14:04.207 --> 00:14:05.887]  That's a person that's in the KKK.
[00:14:07.614 --> 00:14:10.896]  That's a person that's a cult leader and brainwashes children.
[00:14:11.836 --> 00:14:13.837]  That's a person that's an actor and isn't real.
[00:14:14.117 --> 00:14:15.698]  That's a person that's bad.
[00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:18.139]  And they all point at you.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:24.723]  And they feel strong in the big collective of the corporate system going along with that narrative.
[00:14:24.763 --> 00:14:25.783]  It's very inviting.
[00:14:25.843 --> 00:14:27.144]  It's very sexy.
[00:14:27.184 --> 00:14:31.426]  It's very alluring to imagine you're powerful through the power structure.
[00:14:32.446 --> 00:14:33.827]  To imagine you're powerful.
[00:14:36.527 --> 00:14:37.327]  Because here's what's happening.
[00:14:37.367 --> 00:14:38.788]  The followers are scared.
[00:14:39.528 --> 00:14:40.909]  They can feel the energy rising.
[00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:42.249]  They can see the political change.
[00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.550]  The economy's shutting down.
[00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:46.751]  Trump's trying to fix that.
[00:14:47.151 --> 00:14:47.911]  Say what you want about Trump.
[00:14:47.931 --> 00:14:48.611]  He's trying to do that.
[00:14:49.892 --> 00:14:50.792]  He's trying to be president.
[00:14:51.392 --> 00:14:58.195]  And so they're there beta testing their false reality, acting like it's the end of the world that Alex Jones exists.
[00:14:59.595 --> 00:15:01.916]  It's the end of the world that Donald Trump exists.
[00:15:02.396 --> 00:15:04.077]  It's the end of the world.
[00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:07.072]  That someone's speaking out against globalism.
[00:15:07.252 --> 00:15:07.693]  And why?
[00:15:08.213 --> 00:15:09.655]  Because we're right about GMO.
[00:15:09.815 --> 00:15:10.856]  We're right about fluoride.
[00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:11.918]  We're right about the vaccines.
[00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:13.620]  We're right about unelected world government.
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.303]  We're right about the elites working with radical Islam.
[00:15:17.204 --> 00:15:19.346]  And trying to open the borders up to it and protecting it.
[00:15:19.867 --> 00:15:20.748]  And letting them attack.
[00:15:21.048 --> 00:15:22.129]  And not even calling it terror.
[00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.134]  And we're right about globalism being designed to impoverish people.
[00:15:28.479 --> 00:15:29.701]  And so folks are scared.
[00:15:30.241 --> 00:15:31.463]  Even Donald Trump's family.
[00:15:31.883 --> 00:15:35.428]  Ivanka and Jared Kushner aren't bad people, but they're weak-minded.
[00:15:36.028 --> 00:15:37.790]  They live on Fifth Avenue.
[00:15:39.312 --> 00:15:41.875]  They hang around with the richest, disconnected people in the world.
[00:15:42.336 --> 00:15:44.338]  They're not blue-collar rich like their dad.
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.863]  Like the father-in-law for Kushner.
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.523]  And they go out to dinner with the Schmitz of the world.
[00:15:52.563 --> 00:15:54.726]  They go out to dinner with the Clintons of the world.
[00:15:54.766 --> 00:15:58.350]  They go out to dinner with the Soros's of the world.
[00:15:59.331 --> 00:16:09.582]  And they have this elitist attitude towards everybody else and they get scared when their elitist friends start putting pressure on them and telling them your dad's gonna fail if you don't get him back on track.
[00:16:10.484 --> 00:16:11.924]  Or Alex Jones is going to fail.
[00:16:12.024 --> 00:16:13.305]  Alex Jones is going down.
[00:16:13.585 --> 00:16:14.765]  Alex Jones is in trouble.
[00:16:15.025 --> 00:16:16.325]  Alex Jones is under attack.
[00:16:16.566 --> 00:16:20.166]  Alex Jones has got everybody coming after him, second only to Donald Trump.
[00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:26.528]  And people say, oh my gosh, how are you handling it when they walk over on the street and shake my hand?
[00:16:26.568 --> 00:16:29.089]  I really appreciate you, what you've done for everybody.
[00:16:29.109 --> 00:16:30.289]  And I'm like, done for everybody?
[00:16:32.634 --> 00:16:35.036]  I'm so glad they're attacking me everywhere.
[00:16:35.357 --> 00:16:37.499]  I'm so glad they're lying about me everywhere.
[00:16:38.019 --> 00:16:42.984]  I'm so glad they're moving heaven and earth to politically assassinate my character.
[00:16:43.464 --> 00:16:46.947]  Because that means I've dealt them grievous blows.
[00:16:47.228 --> 00:16:49.309]  That means I really counted in this life.
[00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.492]  That meant I was on the field and took it to the enemy.
[00:16:52.913 --> 00:16:56.016]  I wasn't the third measure or the tenth of a measure of a man.
[00:16:57.199 --> 00:16:58.800]  I measured up to my ancestors.
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.180]  I did what it took.
[00:17:00.481 --> 00:17:01.401]  I didn't back down.
[00:17:01.881 --> 00:17:04.202]  Victory or death like Colonel Travis at the Alamo.
[00:17:04.503 --> 00:17:05.383]  And I'll say that now.
[00:17:05.783 --> 00:17:06.944]  Victory or death.
[00:17:07.884 --> 00:17:09.305]  I'm the opposite of scared now.
[00:17:09.705 --> 00:17:15.468]  I am totally invigorated, empowered, and quite frankly can't handle the discernment I have.
[00:17:16.148 --> 00:17:20.750]  That's why I've tended to pour alcohol on top of it because I can't even handle being this alive.
[00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:21.911]  But I'm done with that.
[00:17:25.372 --> 00:17:26.173]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:31.191]  We stand at the threshold of a totally new era, a renaissance.
[00:17:31.692 --> 00:17:32.472]  It's our choice.
[00:17:32.712 --> 00:17:33.613]  We're given free will.
[00:17:35.274 --> 00:17:36.775]  Trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:38.256]  Something good the Vettel one said.
[00:17:41.118 --> 00:17:45.000]  Got kind of changed a little bit by another great writer.
[00:17:46.461 --> 00:17:53.706]  Of course, the book Fear and Loathing of Las Vegas that he wrote, where he said, pray to God, but row away from the rocks.
[00:17:53.966 --> 00:17:54.707]  Hunter S. Thompson.
[00:17:55.247 --> 00:17:56.748]  Pray to God, but row away from the rocks.
[00:17:58.143 --> 00:18:03.548]  We're already seeing cancer up thousands of percentile, depending on the type, 10,000% more in children.
[00:18:03.828 --> 00:18:06.530]  We're already seeing cross-species pollinization.
[00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.512]  We're already seeing mutations accelerate exponentially.
[00:18:09.773 --> 00:18:11.814]  We're already seeing allergies exponentially.
[00:18:12.055 --> 00:18:14.176]  We're seeing neurological disorders off the charts.
[00:18:14.416 --> 00:18:16.458]  We're seeing brain aneurysms off the charts.
[00:18:16.698 --> 00:18:19.020]  We're seeing deformities off the charts in children.
[00:18:19.341 --> 00:18:22.163]  We're seeing the plagues of the new world order.
[00:18:25.942 --> 00:18:33.767]  And I realize, like, we're in a Houdini chamber, and the water's pouring in, and if we don't get out of these chains, folks, we're gonna drown.
[00:18:34.048 --> 00:18:38.871]  I'm fighting as hard as I can to get the chains off me and you, because we're collectively bound together.
[00:18:38.891 --> 00:18:44.315]  And you're saying, you're sitting there, while I'm trying to get the chains off of us, going, wow, you really have courage, thank you.
[00:18:44.835 --> 00:18:45.416]  Courage?
[00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:47.517]  Courage is to sit here and drown!
[00:18:48.558 --> 00:18:50.379]  This is called life force.
[00:18:50.759 --> 00:18:51.540]  It's called will.
[00:18:53.123 --> 00:18:55.044]  It's called the will to not be killed.
[00:18:55.125 --> 00:18:56.486]  It's the will to survive.
[00:19:00.689 --> 00:19:07.694]  But it's all just the PR hype of the empty globalist system attacking Trump, attacking me, you name it.
[00:19:07.734 --> 00:19:09.115]  Has Trump gone sideways some?
[00:19:09.175 --> 00:19:09.635]  Absolutely.
[00:19:09.876 --> 00:19:11.196]  I'm surprised he got this much done.
[00:19:11.377 --> 00:19:16.681]  But he's returning jobs, he's promoting the family, he's promoting people, he's trying to stop radical Islam.
[00:19:17.321 --> 00:19:22.524]  He is moving the power away from the global elites back to America and back to the states and back to our industry.
[00:19:22.604 --> 00:19:24.125]  He's doing a great job.
[00:19:24.345 --> 00:19:31.929]  And that's why even though on the surface he looks like he's given in some, they're only tripling down their attacks because they know he's real and they know the course he's on.
[00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.970]  That's why they say he's not real.
[00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:36.472]  It's why they say I'm not real constantly.
[00:19:38.422 --> 00:19:39.383]  I've got it easier than Trump.
[00:19:39.423 --> 00:19:41.705]  I'm just a broadcast, an investigative system.
[00:19:41.945 --> 00:19:42.906]  I can be totally pure.
[00:19:43.126 --> 00:19:46.449]  Trump has to work with all these groups to compromise to get things done.
[00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:48.610]  Or they'll shut the government down and say he did it.
[00:19:48.851 --> 00:19:50.612]  But overall, he's doing a fabulous job.
[00:19:51.913 --> 00:19:53.715]  Trump's not falling, Trump's rising.
[00:19:54.115 --> 00:19:55.456]  I'm not falling, I'm rising.
[00:19:55.816 --> 00:19:59.780]  They may end up defeating me, but I win in the animating contest.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.300]  You understand?
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.262]  But right now, we are kicking butt.
[00:20:12.856 --> 00:20:20.781]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:22.783]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[00:20:23.543 --> 00:20:30.447]  We can easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand different products.
[00:20:31.048 --> 00:20:36.832]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20 because we private label some, but we also develop
[00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:47.495]  Many of the products originally were some of the top labs in the country, so that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe, and they're also very affordable.
[00:20:47.515 --> 00:20:49.637]  Exactly, you talk about being a game changer, right?
[00:20:49.657 --> 00:20:54.300]  You talk about, we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders, we've both talked to them.
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:21:00.525]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[00:21:00.865 --> 00:21:09.833]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[00:21:10.713 --> 00:21:11.814]  We refuse to screw people.
[00:21:12.155 --> 00:21:13.135]  We refuse to do that.
[00:21:13.516 --> 00:21:16.158]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[00:21:16.258 --> 00:21:18.180]  We're producing something we want to take.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:18.680]  Exactly.
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.101]  We're looking for the best.
[00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:25.003]  We went out and searched for the best to Private Label, and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[00:21:25.203 --> 00:21:28.865]  So we go to these big firms and say, we want to make the dream formula.
[00:21:28.885 --> 00:21:34.888]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[00:21:35.168 --> 00:21:36.369]  It's everywhere.
[00:21:36.569 --> 00:21:37.229]  It's in nature.
[00:21:37.289 --> 00:21:39.390]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:45.793]  Just this bottle of silica, okay, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount that's even in our product, is $35.
[00:21:46.974 --> 00:21:52.237]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[00:21:52.257 --> 00:21:52.898]  This is insane.
[00:21:52.918 --> 00:22:02.084]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, okay, I get that you guys want to do, you know, high power stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000 and then you can sell, you know, multiple bottles of it.
[00:22:02.124 --> 00:22:03.004]  People will buy more of it.
[00:22:03.104 --> 00:22:03.705]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[00:22:03.805 --> 00:22:04.265]  Okay.
[00:22:04.705 --> 00:22:05.586]  Compare that to this.
[00:22:05.806 --> 00:22:07.187]  This is a $50 product.
[00:22:07.207 --> 00:22:10.589]  One of the leaders in the industry has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[00:22:10.609 --> 00:22:10.749]  Okay.
[00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:11.030]  We have 10,000.
[00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.810]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[00:22:14.872 --> 00:22:16.714]  There's no script, there's no teleprompter, I'll just be honest with you.
[00:22:17.135 --> 00:22:22.382]  My problem is, with 20 products now, it's remembering to take them all.
[00:22:22.402 --> 00:22:26.267]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[00:22:26.687 --> 00:22:32.655]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product,
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.381]  My quality of life just isn't as good.
[00:22:35.461 --> 00:22:36.541]  It's changed my life.
[00:22:36.641 --> 00:22:38.882]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[00:22:39.223 --> 00:22:41.104]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[00:22:41.504 --> 00:22:42.944]  I was jogging, lifting weights.
[00:22:43.004 --> 00:22:43.865]  I couldn't lose the weight.
[00:22:44.765 --> 00:22:51.829]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWars change the country and the world.
[00:22:52.229 --> 00:22:52.969]  It's a win-win.
[00:22:53.449 --> 00:22:54.230]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:08.227]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:23:08.287 --> 00:23:09.608]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:23:10.528 --> 00:23:10.909]  Great!
[00:23:10.989 --> 00:23:11.989]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:23:12.109 --> 00:23:16.492]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:23:16.653 --> 00:23:18.214]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:23:18.334 --> 00:23:25.839]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:26.599]  Wow, thank you.
[00:23:26.619 --> 00:23:29.081]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[00:23:29.161 --> 00:23:30.722]  Which nutraceutical do you like best?
[00:23:30.962 --> 00:23:34.163]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:23:34.183 --> 00:23:34.563]  That's amazing.
[00:23:34.583 --> 00:23:35.483]  That's really incredible.
[00:23:35.703 --> 00:23:38.744]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:23:38.764 --> 00:23:40.024]  Like, I haven't felt asleep.
[00:23:40.124 --> 00:23:41.705]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:23:41.785 --> 00:23:42.965]  And I love these guys.
[00:23:43.025 --> 00:23:44.425]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[00:23:45.186 --> 00:23:51.887]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:23:52.047 --> 00:23:52.847]  You will love it.
[00:23:53.087 --> 00:23:53.528]  I'm telling you.
[00:23:53.568 --> 00:23:54.888]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:23:55.208 --> 00:23:59.600]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.382]  It's a win-win.
[00:24:00.523 --> 00:24:01.285]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:24:14.378 --> 00:24:17.420]  Alright, Trump just gave a speech about massive tax cuts he's going to push.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.961]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:18.981 --> 00:24:19.862]  I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:24:19.882 --> 00:24:27.267]  I've got huge North Korean news, economy news, so much positive news that we're going to be getting to as well.
[00:24:27.287 --> 00:24:31.510]  And then we've got more hoaxes in the media against InfoWars.
[00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:35.372]  But before I go any further, let me just go back to what I was talking about.
[00:24:36.293 --> 00:24:41.617]  There's this hoax going on that Trump's going to fall, that InfoWars is going to fall,
[00:24:43.848 --> 00:24:47.271]  But when Trump gets attacked, people just support him more.
[00:24:47.291 --> 00:24:48.513]  The same thing for Infowars.
[00:24:48.653 --> 00:24:55.159]  So, we are literally getting bigger, getting more successful, reaching more people.
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:00.785]  What do you think happens when every major news channel and every major newspaper attacks you and lies about you?
[00:25:01.205 --> 00:25:03.848]  This hit 20 years ago, 30 years ago, when it would destroy you.
[00:25:05.189 --> 00:25:06.791]  MSM is so discredited.
[00:25:07.895 --> 00:25:13.896]  That it sends new people to you that never heard about you before, and our audience is exploding.
[00:25:14.197 --> 00:25:18.598]  We have the biggest audience I've ever had in 22 years, except for election week.
[00:25:18.618 --> 00:25:20.718]  In fact, let me give people basically a graph.
[00:25:20.738 --> 00:25:23.459]  In fact, I'm just going to, this week, do a report on this to show everybody.
[00:25:23.739 --> 00:25:24.839]  To show you what a hoax it is.
[00:25:24.859 --> 00:25:28.340]  That, you know, that InfoWars is imploding.
[00:25:29.608 --> 00:25:33.811]  I can show you Google Analytics over the years, and it basically goes something like this.
[00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:39.094]  You know, it starts back with the website in 1997, got on there in 1995, and it's like this.
[00:25:40.535 --> 00:25:41.935]  And just over the years, it goes like this.
[00:25:43.296 --> 00:25:45.237]  And then with the election, it goes like this.
[00:25:46.158 --> 00:25:49.460]  And now it's kind of gone down a tiny bit, but then still going up.
[00:25:52.141 --> 00:25:56.384]  That's why InfoWars is under attack, because we're going straight up.
[00:25:58.715 --> 00:26:02.857]  In fact, it's more like... traffic, it's more like that.
[00:26:02.877 --> 00:26:05.178]  I mean, that's what's happened since the election.
[00:26:05.538 --> 00:26:11.560]  We're just going straight up, parabolic curve, and then now, almost at that same level.
[00:26:11.881 --> 00:26:14.742]  So we went up to a new high, and we're at a new plateau.
[00:26:16.763 --> 00:26:21.044]  This is 80-plus million people.
[00:26:21.965 --> 00:26:23.285]  This is 60-plus million.
[00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:26.927]  Before the election, our high was 40-something million.
[00:26:28.557 --> 00:26:32.681]  I mean, and that's on our sites, our videos, our articles, listening to the show.
[00:26:34.583 --> 00:26:36.965]  That's not counting everybody duplicating our information.
[00:26:37.025 --> 00:26:38.066]  I'm not up here bragging.
[00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:53.621]  I just want you to understand, just like Tokyo Rose, when we were dropping Fat Man and Little Boy on Hiroshima and Nagasaki from bombers in World War II,
[00:26:56.325 --> 00:27:04.368]  Tokyo Rose was on AM radio and shortwave going, I'm sorry GIs that you're all defeated and your aircraft carriers are all on fire and sinking.
[00:27:04.928 --> 00:27:09.570]  Did you hear today that in the South China Sea we destroyed one more of your battleships?
[00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.251]  Yes, it's too bad you're all dead.
[00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:16.413]  And by then everybody knew it was bull.
[00:27:18.233 --> 00:27:20.934]  But years before it would actually manipulate some people's minds.
[00:27:21.735 --> 00:27:22.095]  In fact,
[00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:28.180]  Tokyo Rose, there was a bunch of women that played her, but it was just Japanese women speaking in English.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:37.011]  They even had one lady that was actually from, I think it was like Canada that worked for the Japanese, but they'd be saying, let me place a nice little classical music for you, or maybe some big band music.
[00:27:37.751 --> 00:27:39.874]  Think of your sweetheart, you're never gonna see her again.
[00:27:39.894 --> 00:27:43.458]  Or your sweetheart's with another man right now back in Kansas.
[00:27:44.568 --> 00:27:45.789]  You want to hear those old tapes.
[00:27:46.049 --> 00:27:47.510]  There's a bunch of them online on YouTube.
[00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:49.571]  You can listen to hours of Tokyo Rose.
[00:27:49.631 --> 00:27:50.952]  And it's so ridiculous.
[00:27:51.272 --> 00:27:54.094]  Just like Baghdad Bob in 2003.
[00:27:54.554 --> 00:27:58.236]  There's fighter bombers with explosions going off a mile behind him.
[00:27:59.897 --> 00:28:01.558]  He's going, we have defeated the Americans.
[00:28:01.578 --> 00:28:03.139]  We drove them back into Kuwait.
[00:28:03.839 --> 00:28:04.620]  They are defeated.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.360]  They are gone.
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:05.961]  It is over.
[00:28:06.021 --> 00:28:07.462]  Yes, we annihilate them.
[00:28:07.922 --> 00:28:09.303]  And a bomb goes off behind him.
[00:28:10.744 --> 00:28:11.344]  Baghdad Bob.
[00:28:13.356 --> 00:28:17.518]  Now, we're not beating the globalists that bad, but, I mean, it's getting close to that.
[00:28:17.959 --> 00:28:26.704]  Le Pen has surged into the number one place in major polls, and those polls are spun in France, just like with Hillary, 10 to 15 points.
[00:28:27.344 --> 00:28:32.867]  National polls still have her ahead, despite the fact that they have been skewing it.
[00:28:35.809 --> 00:28:40.852]  Macron plummets in the polls as Marine Le Pen enjoys boost a week away from election vote.
[00:28:44.229 --> 00:28:47.390]  And that's all being reported, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.750]  It's all unfolding.
[00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:49.831]  It's all happening.
[00:28:49.891 --> 00:28:50.591]  It's beautiful.
[00:28:50.851 --> 00:28:51.551]  It's wonderful.
[00:28:51.831 --> 00:28:52.571]  It's powerful.
[00:28:52.992 --> 00:28:53.952]  Is she going to be perfect?
[00:28:53.972 --> 00:28:54.992]  Is she going to get it all done?
[00:28:55.092 --> 00:28:55.372]  No!
[00:28:55.872 --> 00:29:01.634]  She'll be a lot better than the socialists and the globalists in Hollandaise and the rest of them.
[00:29:03.115 --> 00:29:03.875]  Nationalism!
[00:29:03.915 --> 00:29:05.575]  We're starting to turn the corner.
[00:29:06.176 --> 00:29:07.376]  Good things are happening.
[00:29:08.442 --> 00:29:11.203]  They've got indictments on her to put her in prison pending.
[00:29:12.023 --> 00:29:14.063]  They may arrest her if she gets elected president.
[00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:15.704]  Still, the fight goes on.
[00:29:15.744 --> 00:29:17.384]  That'll make her grow even faster.
[00:29:18.104 --> 00:29:22.565]  She won't be defeated if they put her in prison for a year for criticizing the precious Muslims.
[00:29:22.785 --> 00:29:26.866]  That'll make everybody start criticizing the Muslims running around shooting, killing, and stealing.
[00:29:27.907 --> 00:29:29.067]  And running people over with cars.
[00:29:31.147 --> 00:29:33.208]  If Marilla Penn gets assassinated, is she a loser?
[00:29:33.448 --> 00:29:34.408]  No, she's like Joan of Arc 2.0.
[00:29:35.969 --> 00:29:37.709]  If I get destroyed, but we win the war,
[00:29:39.983 --> 00:29:43.365]  Did Obi-Wan cut Obi to use a goofy allegory in episode 4?
[00:29:43.645 --> 00:29:46.146]  Did he lose or did he win when he let Darth Vader cut him in two?
[00:29:47.887 --> 00:29:49.088]  Escape is not my plan.
[00:29:49.688 --> 00:29:50.749]  I will face them alone.
[00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.589]  Stay with us.
[00:29:52.109 --> 00:29:53.010]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:55.111]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.031 --> 00:29:58.713]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.248 --> 00:30:15.802]  Although conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of showing up to her already-canceled speech at Berkeley, that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans from conducting a large First Amendment rally in its place.
[00:30:16.042 --> 00:30:23.791]  Prominent social media icons such as Gavin McInnes, Lauren Southern, Based Stickman, Baked Alaska, Brittany Pettibone, and
[00:30:23.951 --> 00:30:28.336]  Faith Goldie showed up to support free speech and gave speeches.
[00:30:28.576 --> 00:30:37.446]  Reports that the Berkeley Police did their job in protecting the peace have come in, and apparently a total of six Antifa protesters were arrested.
[00:30:37.707 --> 00:30:43.213]  Two for resisting arrest, one for a drug violation, and another for possessing a weapon.
[00:30:43.533 --> 00:30:51.922]  Two more arrests were made earlier in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police.
[00:30:52.163 --> 00:30:58.029]  Despite these arrests, the protests remained peaceful and dialogue between both sides was present.
[00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:01.513]  This is Millie Weaver reporting to you for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:03.415 --> 00:31:04.957]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[00:31:06.847 --> 00:31:12.511]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:31:13.231 --> 00:31:17.194]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:31:18.075 --> 00:31:20.296]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:31:20.396 --> 00:31:21.537]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:31:21.577 --> 00:31:26.120]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat or more.
[00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.162]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:31:28.622 --> 00:31:33.105]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22 when I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:31:33.145 --> 00:31:33.846]  It's actually scary.
[00:31:36.307 --> 00:31:46.390]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:31:47.370 --> 00:32:00.173]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[00:32:03.095 --> 00:32:10.837]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[00:32:11.057 --> 00:32:17.499]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:32:17.719 --> 00:32:26.001]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:32:26.281 --> 00:32:35.049]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:41.055]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:32:41.395 --> 00:32:41.856]  It works.
[00:32:42.136 --> 00:32:50.463]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[00:32:50.483 --> 00:32:59.990]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[00:33:00.371 --> 00:33:00.851]  A total 360 win.
[00:33:08.717 --> 00:33:12.459]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:16.442]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.542 --> 00:33:22.186]  Sometimes I feel I've got to run away.
[00:33:22.466 --> 00:33:29.591]  I've got to get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me.
[00:33:34.275 --> 00:33:36.917]  The reason the globalists are attacking us is very simple.
[00:33:37.277 --> 00:33:44.381]  They want to use InfoWars as a beta test, a model on how to bring down independent alternative media.
[00:33:45.541 --> 00:33:47.802]  And they've openly said this in hearings in Congress.
[00:33:48.623 --> 00:33:50.424]  They've openly said this on the national news.
[00:33:51.264 --> 00:34:01.270]  They want to punish me and those associated with me so that no one else dare challenge the globalist agenda.
[00:34:02.671 --> 00:34:03.651]  But I'll tell you what's exciting.
[00:34:03.751 --> 00:34:12.373]  As fast as we grow, I see all these other new characters, new researchers, new amazing personalities popping up that are fighting the globalists.
[00:34:13.133 --> 00:34:20.935]  At such a fast rate, there's no way they can shut us down unless they try to shut down the internet itself, which is what they're incrementally trying to do.
[00:34:21.655 --> 00:34:26.336]  They want to turn the web into a glorified, basically Netflix meets Amazon.
[00:34:27.056 --> 00:34:30.217]  So there is that historic fight going on right now.
[00:34:31.206 --> 00:34:34.328]  But it really shows you how weak the globalists are.
[00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:52.420]  That George Soros' law firm that he founded is suing me with a member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York who promotes bringing in refugees who undoubtedly in the whole refugee movement have been connected to sexual assault.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.781]  Does that mean the company itself brought people in?
[00:34:54.821 --> 00:35:00.445]  No, because technically the State Department does, but the owner of the yogurt system is the one promoting it.
[00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:03.180]  Now, is that defamation?
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.080]  Is that slander?
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.741]  Is that a lie?
[00:35:06.741 --> 00:35:13.645]  When they first threatened us with a lawsuit over a month ago, I said to the crew, I said, that headline's a little strong to say they're caught importing rapists.
[00:35:14.745 --> 00:35:22.729]  I just said, go with the headline that it turns out that when the media claimed nobody had done a sexual assault in that case a year ago, that they've now pled guilty.
[00:35:24.244 --> 00:35:33.027]  And if you want to write about Chobani, point out the owner is pushing with George Soros for the importation of people and the State Department system is not vetting them properly.
[00:35:33.967 --> 00:35:35.068]  So we clarified that.
[00:35:35.228 --> 00:35:35.828]  Still suit us.
[00:35:37.049 --> 00:35:38.609]  So then I talked to five top lawyers.
[00:35:38.769 --> 00:35:39.770]  I engaged two of the groups.
[00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:41.350]  It's in the Wall Street Journal today.
[00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:42.851]  Chobani versus Alex Jones.
[00:35:44.391 --> 00:35:47.072]  And all the lawyers say, no, it's a very, very bad case.
[00:35:47.312 --> 00:35:48.253]  We don't understand.
[00:35:48.353 --> 00:35:49.313]  You already corrected.
[00:35:50.959 --> 00:35:59.365]  It's clearly a publicity stunt just to put their name out there and say, oh look, they are suing the fake news purveyor Alex Jones.
[00:36:00.305 --> 00:36:06.109]  And you read the Wall Street Journal, oh Jones made it up that refugees are connected to sexual assault.
[00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:11.113]  Just like Stasi's been hired by Facebook.
[00:36:12.008 --> 00:36:16.510]  Two years ago, in Germany, to go after people that criticize Islamists.
[00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:18.090]  You get arrested if you do.
[00:36:18.331 --> 00:36:22.252]  Just like Marie Le Pen, set to be the next French president!
[00:36:24.573 --> 00:36:25.614]  Under indictment!
[00:36:27.294 --> 00:36:32.516]  For saying, France faces its greatest threat to its existence since the Nazis invaded in 1939, 1940.
[00:36:32.576 --> 00:36:33.097]  Totally true statement!
[00:36:38.317 --> 00:36:40.819]  Massive riots every night in Paris and other cities.
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.662]  Their tourism down 80% the last decade.
[00:36:43.962 --> 00:36:45.443]  Half of that just in the last two years.
[00:36:46.644 --> 00:36:47.946]  Total existential threat.
[00:36:50.488 --> 00:36:51.529]  But you'll be arrested.
[00:36:51.569 --> 00:36:52.490]  You'll be boycotted.
[00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.492]  You'll be sued for defaming our religion.
[00:36:55.612 --> 00:37:01.177]  And now I sit here wanting to see these people vetted from seven countries where they're not being vetted.
[00:37:02.338 --> 00:37:05.241]  Like Syria and Sudan and Libya.
[00:37:09.298 --> 00:37:13.762]  And the lawsuit says, Jones also claims Chobani's bringing in TB.
[00:37:14.102 --> 00:37:15.303]  Well, let me clarify.
[00:37:15.684 --> 00:37:17.606]  Chobani, the company, isn't doing it.
[00:37:18.366 --> 00:37:28.595]  The owner is promoting bringing in refugees under a UN State Department program with the refugee board that he's counseled with, where they're not doing proper vetting.
[00:37:28.776 --> 00:37:30.137]  And that's been all over the news.
[00:37:30.337 --> 00:37:31.918]  The Border Patrol has exposed that.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.481]  So, where am I going with this?
[00:37:36.243 --> 00:37:39.664]  The cops have always had a saying, you can beat the rap, you can't beat the ride.
[00:37:41.625 --> 00:37:46.086]  We'll probably, knock on wood, beat this lawsuit.
[00:37:47.107 --> 00:37:50.708]  But the message is, don't talk like Alex Jones or we'll sue you.
[00:37:52.168 --> 00:37:56.630]  The message is, don't criticize open borders or we'll come after you.
[00:37:57.438 --> 00:37:58.158]  That's globalism.
[00:37:58.638 --> 00:38:26.065]  And that's why they hate Trump, because our country faces an existential true threat to its sovereignty having our borders dissolved, and the whole world told, you're allowed to come here and expect free welfare, and to have your kids for free, and then don't assimilate, join the Democratic Party, and be an America-hating group of out-of-control, self-serving, entitled idiots.
[00:38:28.049 --> 00:38:32.030]  But the good news is humanity is waking up to this 21st century threat.
[00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:43.392]  We're being conquered by the UN and the globalists with giant third world waves of desperate people that the globalists put in those positions, in most cases, who are now besieging our once great republic.
[00:38:46.073 --> 00:38:50.154]  Now I want to get to a bunch of clips and then take your phone calls, but one reason they're attacking us is
[00:38:51.550 --> 00:39:03.118]  We've had Dr. Blaylock and we've had Dr. Wallach and we've had countless scientists and surgeons and brain surgeons and epidemiologists and virologists on, genetic engineers, we've had them all.
[00:39:03.478 --> 00:39:15.747]  And I've read hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, really thousands of white papers on air where governments admit that what they're pushing on us is hurting us.
[00:39:17.301 --> 00:39:25.689]  And here's articles today out of Forbes, out of CNBC, out of InfoWars.com, you name it.
[00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.092]  And I want to just go over a few of these for you.
[00:39:29.093 --> 00:39:31.515]  Why is diet soda so bad for your brain?
[00:39:33.757 --> 00:39:34.418]  That's Forbes.
[00:39:34.498 --> 00:39:39.003]  Now, I remember 21 years ago, having medical doctors on.
[00:39:40.213 --> 00:39:55.665]  They were breaking down that in the rhesus monkey studies at Searle in the 1970s, upwards of 27 percent, sometimes more, of the baby monkeys died when low levels of aspartame were added to their milk.
[00:39:57.707 --> 00:39:58.868]  They then did rat studies.
[00:39:59.248 --> 00:40:04.712]  They could not get aspartame, that's the excretion of a type of bacteria, genetically engineering I should add.
[00:40:07.154 --> 00:40:07.815]  They could not
[00:40:10.714 --> 00:40:11.375]  Get it approved.
[00:40:12.215 --> 00:40:33.995]  Donald Rumsfeld, formerly at the Defense Department at the time, came into the Reagan administration and got Monsanto to buy Searle, and then Reagan administration, not that Reagan knew what was going on, he was a big Diet Coke fan, he didn't know, approved Aspartame, known as Equal, or NutraSweet, in the brand names.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.441]  You can read it from even the HuffPost.
[00:40:38.481 --> 00:40:40.482]  Donald Rumsfeld, The Strange History of Aspartame.
[00:40:41.003 --> 00:40:44.986]  Now, it's an excitotoxin.
[00:40:45.006 --> 00:40:47.167]  At 89 degrees, it turns into formaldehyde.
[00:40:47.707 --> 00:40:52.591]  Formaldehyde eats holes in brain tissue, attacks the nerve tissue of the eyeballs.
[00:40:53.391 --> 00:40:54.572]  Just, I'm not a scientist.
[00:40:54.712 --> 00:40:56.854]  I've read literally hundreds of reports.
[00:40:57.114 --> 00:41:00.096]  I've had probably a hundred guests on over the years about aspartame.
[00:41:00.556 --> 00:41:01.577]  It's very addictive.
[00:41:02.177 --> 00:41:03.338]  It's an excitotoxin.
[00:41:03.378 --> 00:41:04.399]  It's a form of speed.
[00:41:07.406 --> 00:41:11.889]  Now, it also makes you fat because it's an excitotoxin and makes you hungry.
[00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:14.011]  So you end up eating more food.
[00:41:15.792 --> 00:41:22.077]  Now, I remember telling people 20 years ago, diet drinks make you fat, and I got a letter in the mail threatening from a law firm to sue me.
[00:41:22.417 --> 00:41:23.278]  I told them, go ahead.
[00:41:24.859 --> 00:41:25.920]  They did sue a lot of folks.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:36.048]  Today, even CNN admits that aspartame is causing brain damage, problems in the optic nerve, you name it.
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:42.902]  So here it is, Forbes, why is diet soda making so bad for your brain?
[00:41:43.022 --> 00:41:44.942]  Another article, why does diet soda make you fat?
[00:41:46.743 --> 00:41:48.183]  And it goes through all these big studies.
[00:41:49.143 --> 00:41:49.743]  Here's another one.
[00:41:50.164 --> 00:41:54.065]  Now again, we told you 22 years ago, one of my first big topics.
[00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:55.465]  So I had the studies.
[00:41:56.105 --> 00:41:56.865]  And I had guests on.
[00:41:58.086 --> 00:42:00.206]  Now who do we owe for the world knowing about this?
[00:42:00.346 --> 00:42:02.167]  It was moms and pops.
[00:42:02.287 --> 00:42:03.587]  It was average activists.
[00:42:04.208 --> 00:42:05.568]  I knew people that would go stand
[00:42:07.449 --> 00:42:08.490]  On the corners.
[00:42:10.832 --> 00:42:11.813]  At the supermarkets.
[00:42:12.773 --> 00:42:14.094]  And the police would threaten to arrest him.
[00:42:14.114 --> 00:42:14.895]  I've done this myself.
[00:42:16.016 --> 00:42:19.699]  Handing out flyers with facts about aspartame.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.222]  We've interviewed people whose wives and husbands died of it young.
[00:42:25.026 --> 00:42:25.787]  With brain tumors.
[00:42:25.827 --> 00:42:27.348]  And the doctors said, yes, the aspartame.
[00:42:27.388 --> 00:42:28.049]  It's been well known.
[00:42:28.389 --> 00:42:32.633]  And they would go lovingly warn people, because it's in children's foods.
[00:42:32.914 --> 00:42:34.235]  It's in all major gums.
[00:42:34.455 --> 00:42:39.340]  You cannot find gum at the supermarket, I dare you to, that doesn't have aspartame in it.
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:40.881]  It's in the non-sugar gum.
[00:42:40.921 --> 00:42:41.882]  It's in the sugar gum.
[00:42:42.183 --> 00:42:43.124]  It's in candy now.
[00:42:43.504 --> 00:42:47.348]  It's gone into tens of thousands of products from just a few, because the patent's up on it.
[00:42:47.808 --> 00:42:49.450]  And it's very addicting.
[00:42:51.132 --> 00:43:03.015]  Silicon Valley elite are flocking to an extremely high fat diet in hopes of living longer, showing it keeps your brain cells healthier and your other cells longer, as long as it's not a trans fat or as long as it's not been burned.
[00:43:03.336 --> 00:43:06.456]  And that gets into all the technical types of fat it creates that are highly toxic.
[00:43:06.697 --> 00:43:12.238]  But the healthiest thing to eat in the world is raw fat.
[00:43:13.278 --> 00:43:16.219]  If it doesn't have bio-accumulated heavy metals or toxins in it.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.460]  And you eat that,
[00:43:20.086 --> 00:43:24.909]  With raw green leafy vegetables, and that is the longest living people in the world.
[00:43:25.289 --> 00:43:28.371]  I've had Dr. Wallach on for 20 years.
[00:43:30.472 --> 00:43:31.973]  I've had other doctors on.
[00:43:32.693 --> 00:43:39.777]  It is a known fact of the elite, and here it is in CNBC.
[00:43:39.797 --> 00:43:41.018]  20 years after we told you.
[00:43:41.518 --> 00:43:43.879]  This is just today, without me even trying.
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.921]  This is why they hate us, folks.
[00:43:47.321 --> 00:43:48.042]  You know what's happening?
[00:43:49.562 --> 00:44:08.879]  We talked about this with experts 20 years ago and about 15 years ago they began to report in mainstream news that the German elite and the British elite and the Chinese elite have their own quote clean vaccines that are made in limited allotments that don't have all the bad additives in them.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.503]  There still could be some side effects but learned immunity is real.
[00:44:13.744 --> 00:44:14.544]  It's a real science.
[00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:17.607]  They always lie and say that I'm saying it isn't a real science.
[00:44:18.167 --> 00:44:19.207]  No, it's a real science.
[00:44:19.527 --> 00:44:22.668]  What they give us is a literal IQ reducer with steroids.
[00:44:22.888 --> 00:44:23.428]  Let's go further.
[00:44:24.969 --> 00:44:39.993]  John Rappaport links to the Psychiatric News, links to the Journal of American Medicine, and JAMA Neurology and a bunch of other studies that Selexa, Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft,
[00:44:42.426 --> 00:44:50.570]  Lexapro, Luvox, and others all cause massive increases in strokes and the risk of intracranial hemorrhages.
[00:44:53.751 --> 00:44:59.533]  Folks, what is XTC or MOLLY or the different variants of MDMA do?
[00:45:00.134 --> 00:45:02.955]  The Germans invented it in the 20s in an accident in a chemical plant.
[00:45:03.375 --> 00:45:03.835]  You can look it up.
[00:45:04.315 --> 00:45:06.236]  By the 80s it was called the love drugs.
[00:45:06.456 --> 00:45:07.957]  Psychologists were handing it out to everybody.
[00:45:08.397 --> 00:45:10.038]  It is the only known admitted treatment for
[00:45:12.108 --> 00:45:13.108]  Post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:45:13.429 --> 00:45:20.932]  The problem is they had to ban it because if you start taking it every week over a year or so, it'll leave holes in your brain and cause massive hemorrhages.
[00:45:21.872 --> 00:45:24.313]  What class is the serotonin reuptake inhibitor?
[00:45:25.394 --> 00:45:27.715]  It's in the hallucinogen, psychotropic class.
[00:45:28.135 --> 00:45:29.736]  What class is MDMA in?
[00:45:29.776 --> 00:45:30.236]  The same thing.
[00:45:30.516 --> 00:45:31.817]  It's just a lot stronger.
[00:45:34.578 --> 00:45:39.780]  I had a girlfriend in college that sometimes would take like 10 Prozacs and she'd be bombed out of her head for a day.
[00:45:40.981 --> 00:45:41.561]  In ecstasy.
[00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.590]  Same thing.
[00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:46.371]  Same class of drugs.
[00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:49.251]  You take that stuff every day for a couple years?
[00:45:50.672 --> 00:45:51.712]  You take it for a decade?
[00:45:52.092 --> 00:46:06.636]  Everyone I know that's taken that stuff for more than a decade has either a skin disease where their skin's totally pale or they get tumors or they get brain tumors or they have hemorrhages and die.
[00:46:08.237 --> 00:46:09.237]  I probably have
[00:46:11.353 --> 00:46:21.635]  I have five or more friends that have died of brain hemorrhages or brain tumors that have been on Prozac-type drugs since high school.
[00:46:21.935 --> 00:46:24.556]  And they're dying in the last few years.
[00:46:24.856 --> 00:46:25.716]  I go to their funerals.
[00:46:29.257 --> 00:46:31.637]  Then I talk to their families and they go, yeah, it was the Luvox.
[00:46:34.038 --> 00:46:35.418]  I have a really good friend who went on
[00:46:36.377 --> 00:46:39.038]  Paxil, within one year, got the disease.
[00:46:39.299 --> 00:46:40.379]  Viriligo, what's it called?
[00:46:40.399 --> 00:46:42.420]  Where you turn totally white, look like a vampire?
[00:46:43.161 --> 00:46:44.081]  Start having nosebleeds?
[00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:48.124]  And he said, listen, I hate it, I hate it, but now I'm totally addicted.
[00:46:48.144 --> 00:46:49.304]  I go crazy if I don't take it.
[00:46:51.685 --> 00:46:55.528]  Here it is, SSRI, antidepressants increase risk of intercranial hemorrhage.
[00:46:55.888 --> 00:47:01.391]  Patients being treated with SSRIs had a 70% increase in risk of experiencing an intercranial hemorrhage.
[00:47:01.671 --> 00:47:04.913]  And that's just in their own study, looking at people over a year.
[00:47:06.769 --> 00:47:07.630]  Imagine a decade.
[00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:15.535]  From Healthline.com, an inner cranial hemorrhage, ICH refers to an acute bleeding inside your skull or brain.
[00:47:15.915 --> 00:47:17.816]  It's a life-threatening hemorrhage emergency.
[00:47:18.737 --> 00:47:20.878]  You should go to the emergency room right away or call 911.
[00:47:21.158 --> 00:47:21.639]  Yeah.
[00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:28.603]  The public has learned about the increased risk of suicide and violent behavior, including murder, stemming from the use of SSRI antidepressants.
[00:47:28.663 --> 00:47:29.344]  Now there's more.
[00:47:30.543 --> 00:47:43.371]  A study published Friday in JAMA Neurology has found that patients taking antidepressants that are strong inhibitors of serotonin reuptake may be at an increased risk for intercranial hemorrhage, particularly during the first month of use.
[00:47:43.791 --> 00:47:46.873]  And then over time it gets worse, but it's that first month's the really bad time.
[00:47:48.994 --> 00:47:50.475]  It goes on the Journal of Psychiatry.
[00:47:50.495 --> 00:47:53.837]  It says that it could kill you in the first seven days.
[00:47:54.238 --> 00:47:56.579]  This is just a study on the first few months of use.
[00:47:56.599 --> 00:47:57.940]  There's other ones on long-term use.
[00:47:59.719 --> 00:48:02.161]  It eats holes in your brain.
[00:48:02.742 --> 00:48:04.924]  It makes your brain do things it's not supposed to.
[00:48:05.244 --> 00:48:06.925]  Meanwhile, you know what I do when I'm down a little bit?
[00:48:07.946 --> 00:48:16.994]  I take 5-HTP, which is just a normal brain chemical you buy at the store, like 20 bucks a bottle, and I take Knockout, which has plants that have the same thing in it.
[00:48:18.435 --> 00:48:19.356]  I don't take it every night.
[00:48:21.658 --> 00:48:22.398]  By the way, Knockout's $19.95.
[00:48:22.438 --> 00:48:22.839]  L-Tryptophan,
[00:48:25.623 --> 00:48:33.907]  Serotonin from organic sources, valerian root that has the plant compounds, lemon balm, chamomile, and other known things.
[00:48:34.267 --> 00:48:42.971]  And my lawyer who wrote the Texas Family Codes, one of the top lawyers in Texas, has been on four different things, sleep studies, you name it.
[00:48:43.392 --> 00:48:44.912]  He said knockout changed his life.
[00:48:44.952 --> 00:48:50.255]  He looks 10 years younger and literally just says he wants to come on air and talk about it because
[00:48:52.159 --> 00:48:54.000]  It changed his life, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:55.161]  It's mother nature.
[00:48:55.241 --> 00:48:56.782]  Totally natural, totally healthy.
[00:48:57.062 --> 00:48:58.122]  And it does the opposite.
[00:48:58.222 --> 00:49:01.924]  It gives your brain the chemicals that are being depleted.
[00:49:04.906 --> 00:49:09.668]  And when they get depleted, you take these chemicals that still force the brain to carry out those functions.
[00:49:09.728 --> 00:49:16.052]  It'll start dragging other chemicals through the blood-brain barrier, other than serotonin or dopamine, and cause brain damage.
[00:49:16.372 --> 00:49:17.233]  And that's in the medical literature.
[00:49:17.253 --> 00:49:19.674]  I didn't mean to go into a plug separately on knockout.
[00:49:21.099 --> 00:49:23.760]  It's just sunshine, clean water, herbs.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:27.341]  That's what the apothecaries were, the old ancient doctors in every culture.
[00:49:27.361 --> 00:49:30.582]  That was one half of medicine, was plants, herbs, apothecaries.
[00:49:31.182 --> 00:49:32.123]  That's what the pharmacy is.
[00:49:32.183 --> 00:49:43.426]  It's why the pharmacy symbols a bowl with a stone mallet or stone grinder to grind the herbs, to drink them as a tea, to drink them as an oil.
[00:49:44.207 --> 00:49:47.648]  And all we've done is brought back all the best stuff that's out there, but I didn't mean to get into that.
[00:49:47.948 --> 00:49:48.468]  The point is,
[00:49:49.929 --> 00:50:02.173]  Here we are telling you SSRIs eat holes in your brain and give you all sorts of problems where you get aneurysms and intercranial bleeding and strokes and all sorts of other crap.
[00:50:02.253 --> 00:50:03.253]  That's what it does.
[00:50:03.333 --> 00:50:04.534]  It's hard core.
[00:50:06.114 --> 00:50:08.255]  It's in the hallucinogen family.
[00:50:08.535 --> 00:50:09.895]  That's what psychotropics are.
[00:50:12.076 --> 00:50:14.057]  Okay, maybe you took acid five times in college.
[00:50:14.757 --> 00:50:15.797]  Changed your world, didn't it?
[00:50:16.037 --> 00:50:17.578]  Imagine taking this stuff for five years.
[00:50:20.572 --> 00:50:23.595]  That's why you hear about people drinking on that stuff, and then they go out and kill a bunch of people?
[00:50:23.635 --> 00:50:25.537]  Because you're out of your mind, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:50:25.577 --> 00:50:26.398]  It's crazy!
[00:50:27.639 --> 00:50:30.122]  So, here's just a few articles on that today.
[00:50:30.322 --> 00:50:31.523]  Look at this article on the Daily Mail.
[00:50:31.804 --> 00:50:37.369]  How the CIA tried to turn a cat into a cyborg spy by implanting it with a microphone and an antenna.
[00:50:38.611 --> 00:50:41.534]  This was decades ago they did this, now declassified.
[00:50:42.509 --> 00:50:52.078]  I was at my press conference Friday and I brought up chimeras, human-animal hybrids, as a major threat to humanity because of the viruses that it's giving rise to and mutations.
[00:50:53.059 --> 00:50:55.241]  And the media all made fun of me and said I was crazy.
[00:50:55.481 --> 00:51:00.166]  And hundreds of newspapers, they said it didn't exist because they think you're stupid.
[00:51:00.466 --> 00:51:01.187]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:03.348 --> 00:51:04.769]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:51:04.949 --> 00:51:07.351]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.
[00:51:07.532 --> 00:51:14.837]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:25.346]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:51:25.666 --> 00:51:33.250]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:43.476]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:51:43.716 --> 00:51:45.637]  And this part is most important.
[00:51:45.757 --> 00:51:52.221]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:51:52.561 --> 00:51:53.644]  That means it's clean.
[00:51:54.005 --> 00:51:55.007]  That means it's pure.
[00:51:55.147 --> 00:51:57.953]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:51:58.033 --> 00:52:00.699]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:52:00.839 --> 00:52:02.483]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:52:03.473 --> 00:52:16.025]  Although conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of showing up to her already-canceled speech at Berkeley, that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans from conducting a large First Amendment rally in its place.
[00:52:16.285 --> 00:52:24.012]  Prominent social media icons such as Gavin McInnes, Lauren Southern, Based Stickman, Baked Alaska, Brittany Pennybone, and
[00:52:24.192 --> 00:52:28.557]  Faith Goldie showed up to support free speech and gave speeches.
[00:52:28.797 --> 00:52:37.688]  Reports that the Berkeley police did their job in protecting the peace have come in, and apparently a total of six Antifa protesters were arrested.
[00:52:37.928 --> 00:52:43.435]  Two for resisting arrest, one for a drug violation, and another for possessing a weapon.
[00:52:43.755 --> 00:52:52.138]  Two more arrests were made earlier in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police.
[00:52:52.398 --> 00:52:58.221]  Despite these arrests, the protests remained peaceful and dialogue between both sides was present.
[00:52:58.461 --> 00:53:01.602]  This is Millie Weaver reporting to you for InfoWars.com.
[00:53:03.211 --> 00:53:04.572]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:53:04.852 --> 00:53:06.132]  You can't survive without it.
[00:53:06.332 --> 00:53:07.233]  But where do you get it?
[00:53:07.553 --> 00:53:13.295]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:53:13.535 --> 00:53:19.257]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:53:19.437 --> 00:53:36.304]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:53:36.704 --> 00:53:38.826]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:53:39.186 --> 00:53:40.387]  Stainless steel construction.
[00:53:40.667 --> 00:53:41.408]  Easy assembly.
[00:53:41.688 --> 00:53:42.328]  Low maintenance.
[00:53:42.609 --> 00:53:44.430]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:54:13.709 --> 00:54:18.092]  Another ragtag band declaring independence.
[00:54:21.034 --> 00:54:23.196]  They laid their bodies down in a bloody war.
[00:54:24.597 --> 00:54:27.699]  The least I can do is lay my name down.
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.141]  The least I can do is get sued.
[00:54:30.161 --> 00:54:31.322]  The least I can do is get attacked.
[00:54:31.882 --> 00:54:37.247]  The least I can do is have the media perch on top of family custody hearing and
[00:54:38.226 --> 00:54:39.447]  Partially take my kids away from me.
[00:54:39.867 --> 00:54:41.128]  And I'm sure a lot more is going to come.
[00:54:41.148 --> 00:54:42.649]  That's just the way this is.
[00:54:42.689 --> 00:54:43.450]  And I ask for it.
[00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:44.670]  I don't blame God.
[00:54:45.391 --> 00:54:47.953]  I say if it's God's will, hit me harder.
[00:54:47.993 --> 00:54:48.393]  Let's go.
[00:54:48.413 --> 00:54:50.574]  Because I'm ready to take the globalists on.
[00:54:50.594 --> 00:54:51.655]  We're going to defeat them in the end.
[00:54:53.677 --> 00:54:56.278]  Far ahead of their time!
[00:54:57.979 --> 00:55:00.961]  Without the renegades, Lord knows where we'd be.
[00:55:01.842 --> 00:55:02.763]  Without the renegades.
[00:55:04.346 --> 00:55:07.068]  When it comes to heroes, renegades are mine.
[00:55:07.708 --> 00:55:08.869]  Okay, let's get to this article.
[00:55:08.909 --> 00:55:09.569]  It's behind me.
[00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:24.419]  They've got some other really shocking graphics that are in the CIA documents that go back to the 1980s, but were declassified in 2001, but not publicly disseminated.
[00:55:24.439 --> 00:55:30.483]  So WikiLeaks released this, and this is the stuff they tried to hire my dad for back in the 1980s.
[00:55:32.645 --> 00:55:34.066]  And by the way, he wasn't that special.
[00:55:34.086 --> 00:55:41.050]  They were trying to hire most of the top implant dentists in Texas that he knew to get double the pay.
[00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:42.111]  It'd be like $500,000.
[00:55:42.931 --> 00:55:44.152]  It was $500,000 back then.
[00:55:45.473 --> 00:55:54.798]  To go work in Maryland in a black project dealing with cybernetics, implanting electronics in humans and animals.
[00:55:55.299 --> 00:55:57.160]  Now I've told you the story for 20 years on air.
[00:55:58.821 --> 00:56:00.542]  And now you notice it's in the news.
[00:56:03.186 --> 00:56:05.447]  But believe me, this stuff's been in the field for a long time.
[00:56:05.488 --> 00:56:09.550]  Not just cats, but rats, birds, insects, and humans.
[00:56:10.211 --> 00:56:16.275]  A lot of military people volunteer for this, and they literally have bionic men out there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:17.155 --> 00:56:24.160]  How the CIA tried to turn a cat into a cyborg spy by implanting it with a microphone and antenna.
[00:56:25.486 --> 00:56:32.171]  The cat had a microphone antenna and battery pack electrically embedded into its skin so the feline could act as a covert recording device.
[00:56:32.651 --> 00:56:39.757]  Recently declassified documents show how the scientists responsible for the cruel research were praised by spy chiefs for their pioneering work.
[00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:45.601]  You know the big stuff's nanotech inside the body and for 50 years they've had soldiers drinking liquid.
[00:56:48.706 --> 00:56:51.609]  Liquid oxygen, basically, in a water base into the lungs.
[00:56:51.849 --> 00:56:53.230]  There's Aquaman, all of it.
[00:56:53.471 --> 00:56:56.013]  And it's all public, but the general public hears it and just laughs at you.
[00:56:56.173 --> 00:56:57.795]  They don't know any of this is actually going on.
[00:56:57.815 --> 00:56:59.776]  They just go, oh, Alex Jones is crazy.
[00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:01.478]  Ha ha, spider goats.
[00:57:01.778 --> 00:57:03.940]  25 years after spider goats were declassified by the U.S.
[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:04.221]  Army.
[00:57:04.441 --> 00:57:07.504]  Part spider, part goat to create spider body armor out of their milk.
[00:57:08.953 --> 00:57:10.514]  They were laughing at me at a press conference.
[00:57:10.814 --> 00:57:19.137]  I said, you know, things like spider goats, chimeras, and it was all, he's crazy, he's stupid, isn't it funny, he said the sun came up.
[00:57:20.438 --> 00:57:28.081]  The strange eavesdropping technique, though never used in the field, yeah right, resurfaced this week when WikiLeaks tweeted a link to a classified CIA memo.
[00:57:28.936 --> 00:57:31.879]  The research was dubbed Project Acoustic Kitty.
[00:57:31.899 --> 00:57:33.821]  13 million dollar project over a five year development.
[00:57:34.282 --> 00:57:35.343]  In the 1960s.
[00:57:35.843 --> 00:57:36.904]  Yeah, I'm gonna be honest.
[00:57:36.964 --> 00:57:38.086]  I didn't even read the whole article.
[00:57:38.266 --> 00:57:38.987]  I just went off memory.
[00:57:39.027 --> 00:57:39.567]  I said 1980s.
[00:57:39.627 --> 00:57:40.328]  I'm sorry.
[00:57:40.408 --> 00:57:41.409]  It's 1960s.
[00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:43.571]  I read another article this weekend that didn't say that.
[00:57:43.591 --> 00:57:44.552]  It didn't say when.
[00:57:44.592 --> 00:57:46.935]  I just knew that my dad was told about it in the 1980s.
[00:57:48.717 --> 00:57:50.078]  And he said, you know, no thanks.
[00:57:50.118 --> 00:57:51.600]  I don't think I'm gonna be involved in that.
[00:57:55.387 --> 00:57:57.048]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:58.229 --> 00:57:59.150]  Oh, it's so funny!
[00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:00.091]  Ha, ha, ha!
[00:58:00.671 --> 00:58:07.857]  What about the human-animal hybrids they've been creating in utero, implanting humanoids in cows for at least 30 years we know of?
[00:58:08.857 --> 00:58:13.679]  That was in the BBC 20 years ago that it was going on a decade before.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.660]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:18.221]  Briefly, we're about to sell out over the next few days.
[00:58:18.582 --> 00:58:23.124]  Bone broth, turmeric, the caveman ultimate paleo formula that people love so much.
[00:58:23.544 --> 00:58:24.284]  Why am I doing 53% off?
[00:58:24.304 --> 00:58:26.305]  Because I want people that haven't tried it to try it.
[00:58:26.846 --> 00:58:27.486]  It sells out.
[00:58:27.506 --> 00:58:29.127]  It's not like it's not a great product.
[00:58:29.147 --> 00:58:30.207]  It's one of our top five sellers.
[00:58:30.567 --> 00:58:31.668]  I just want you to be able to try it.
[00:58:32.108 --> 00:58:44.594]  It's a loss a liter if you sign up for auto ship an additional 10% off and 50% off super blue our fluoride free toothpaste now back in stock and you literally stick your thumb in the globalist eye by supporting the hardcore InfoWar.
[00:58:45.315 --> 00:58:46.115]  InfoWarStore.com.

[00:58:49.897 --> 00:58:50.638]  Second Hour coming up.

[00:59:09.146 --> 00:59:13.968]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.

[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:38.165]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[00:59:38.285 --> 00:59:41.267]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[00:59:53.977 --> 00:59:59.882]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:18.967]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.167 --> 01:00:22.608]  You know, this is a spiritual battle.
[01:00:22.688 --> 01:00:23.428]  It's like a movie.
[01:00:23.448 --> 01:00:30.329]  It's like the Matrix, where Agent Smith is everywhere and they can just activate through anybody he wants, and suddenly they become Agent Smith.
[01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:35.550]  I mean, I've got people literally just coming out of the woodwork to bring us down, flipping out, you name it.
[01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:36.410]  But you know what?
[01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:40.931]  People are coming out of the woodwork to also counter that, like it's Fight Club or something.
[01:00:40.991 --> 01:00:43.612]  So, people are really showing their true colors right now.
[01:00:44.625 --> 01:00:46.646]  There's a spiritual battle happening on this planet.
[01:00:47.286 --> 01:00:50.128]  Marie Le Pen is up in the polls.
[01:00:50.268 --> 01:00:57.571]  She's neck and neck in many polls despite the fact that the French government's trying to spin polls against her and has said it's the French government's job to defeat her.
[01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:58.932]  French election week.
[01:00:58.952 --> 01:01:01.953]  Le Pen closing gap with Macron in many polls.
[01:01:02.013 --> 01:01:03.514]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:01:03.774 --> 01:01:05.895]  Here's a John Bowne report breaking it all down.
[01:01:06.475 --> 01:01:08.957]  Why is InfoWars under such mega attack?
[01:01:09.037 --> 01:01:09.677]  Well, we know why.
[01:01:10.916 --> 01:01:21.920]  We're promoting nationalism, free market capitalism, local sovereign control, and comparing that to unelected globalism is very easy and very popular.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:31.703]  And they know we're exponentially growing, so they want to shut us down as a way to intimidate everybody else and as a way to set a precedent, as I said earlier.
[01:01:32.263 --> 01:01:37.745]  First authoritarian movements shut down the independent press that is criticizing the power structure.
[01:01:38.405 --> 01:01:43.867]  Then it begins to actually persecute and go after people claiming they're spies or involved in espionage.
[01:01:44.447 --> 01:01:50.449]  They admit in the news three months ago, congressional hearings, I'm under criminal investigation for actually being a Russian spy.
[01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:54.130]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:55.891]  I will not let you down.
[01:01:56.011 --> 01:01:58.912]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:01:59.492 --> 01:02:01.032]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:03.173]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:06.094]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[01:02:06.254 --> 01:02:06.714]  I don't know
[01:02:22.319 --> 01:02:27.460]  What happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be?
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:32.581]  I began to realize that she is an angel and she wants to help me!
[01:02:32.821 --> 01:02:33.281]  No!
[01:02:33.721 --> 01:02:33.961]  No!
[01:02:34.341 --> 01:02:36.062]  You've got to be sent for reprogramming!
[01:02:36.182 --> 01:02:36.582]  Hillary!
[01:02:36.642 --> 01:02:37.062]  Hillary!
[01:02:37.242 --> 01:02:38.262]  I'm reprogramming!
[01:02:38.802 --> 01:02:40.903]  I'm reprogramming!
[01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:41.763]  No!
[01:02:41.963 --> 01:02:42.423]  No!
[01:02:42.923 --> 01:02:43.223]  All right!
[01:02:43.243 --> 01:02:43.343]  No!
[01:02:43.423 --> 01:02:43.903]  Hillary!
[01:02:44.224 --> 01:02:44.704]  Hillary!
[01:02:44.804 --> 01:02:46.284]  Save me, Bobby!
[01:02:46.424 --> 01:02:48.844]  Hillary!
[01:02:49.845 --> 01:02:51.145]  Russian scum!
[01:02:53.988 --> 01:02:59.050]  The stay-behind networks, the deep state operatives, the shadow government that won't leave.
[01:03:00.071 --> 01:03:01.291]  Why are they coming after us?
[01:03:01.872 --> 01:03:02.572]  Look at Le Pen.
[01:03:03.593 --> 01:03:08.035]  Frances Le Pen, on offensive with a vote a week away.
[01:03:08.495 --> 01:03:13.777]  She's now ahead, even in their twisted polls, against her competitor in the runoff.
[01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:18.880]  Le Pen's Euro contortions underlined French reluctance to exit.
[01:03:19.659 --> 01:03:25.722]  Can Le Pen beat Macron in the French election despite losing in the first round?
[01:03:26.922 --> 01:03:28.663]  This is a big deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:28.703 --> 01:03:33.205]  And even if she loses, think of a nationalist anti-globalist that close to winning.
[01:03:34.446 --> 01:03:35.986]  That's why they want to punish her.
[01:03:36.086 --> 01:03:40.749]  She's under criminal indictment and they're trying to disqualify her right now.
[01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:43.750]  And they're saying even if she wins, they're going to arrest her.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.502]  She's a member of the EU Parliament, so she had immunity.
[01:03:47.822 --> 01:03:49.164]  Oh yeah, the EU gave herself immunity.
[01:03:49.444 --> 01:03:53.507]  But now, they're trying to strip that immunity.
[01:03:53.768 --> 01:04:01.534]  The fake job scandal involving France's far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen could amount to some 5 million euros.
[01:04:02.195 --> 01:04:10.262]  According to Agence France-Presse, investigators have unearthed new evidence suggesting 17 other front national deputies are involved.
[01:04:10.902 --> 01:04:16.608]  Among them, her partner Louis Aliot and Front National Vice President Florian Filippo.
[01:04:17.469 --> 01:04:24.316]  Le Pen is alleged to have faked her parliamentary expenses to pay her bodyguard and assistant close to €340,000.
[01:04:25.477 --> 01:04:30.482]  Earlier this month, French prosecutors asked the European Parliament to lift her immunity from prosecution.
[01:04:38.348 --> 01:04:49.075]  The word's gone out.
[01:04:49.396 --> 01:04:53.739]  Lawsuits, attacks, whatever it takes, you're going to be shut down.
[01:04:53.839 --> 01:04:54.259]  You know what?
[01:04:54.579 --> 01:04:56.641]  If that's what happens, that's what's supposed to happen.
[01:04:57.021 --> 01:04:58.082]  It's like the Alamo, baby.
[01:04:58.342 --> 01:04:59.563]  I'm never giving in.
[01:04:59.923 --> 01:05:01.224]  Victory or death.
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:16.463]  Although conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of showing up to her already cancelled speech at Berkeley, that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans from conducting a large First Amendment rally in its place.
[01:05:16.683 --> 01:05:24.425]  Prominent social media icons such as Gavin McInnes, Lauren Southern, Based Stickman, Baked Alaska, Brittany Pettibone, and
[01:05:24.605 --> 01:05:29.009]  Faith Goldie showed up to support free speech and gave speeches.
[01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:38.098]  Reports that the Berkeley police did their job in protecting the peace have come in, and apparently a total of six Antifa protesters were arrested.
[01:05:38.338 --> 01:05:43.864]  Two for resisting arrest, one for a drug violation, and another for possessing a weapon.
[01:05:44.184 --> 01:05:52.568]  Two more arrests were made earlier in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police.
[01:05:52.828 --> 01:05:58.650]  Despite these arrests, the protests remained peaceful and dialogue between both sides was present.
[01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:02.012]  This is Millie Weaver reporting to you for InfoWars.com.
[01:06:03.715 --> 01:06:11.480]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:18.124]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[01:06:18.344 --> 01:06:26.629]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[01:06:26.909 --> 01:06:35.656]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[01:06:35.936 --> 01:06:41.680]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:42.481]  It works.
[01:06:42.761 --> 01:06:51.088]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[01:06:51.108 --> 01:07:00.615]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[01:07:00.996 --> 01:07:01.476]  A total 360 win.
[01:07:03.558 --> 01:07:04.078]  I do not agree.
[01:07:04.138 --> 01:07:05.540]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:06.661]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:07:06.901 --> 01:07:07.842]  Why is this so good?
[01:07:08.122 --> 01:07:13.366]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:26.997]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:07:27.057 --> 01:07:28.439]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:07:29.339 --> 01:07:30.801]  Spreading disease around.
[01:07:30.861 --> 01:07:33.344]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:07:33.444 --> 01:07:34.705]  These are all parasites.
[01:07:34.745 --> 01:07:35.847]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:07:35.867 --> 01:07:36.948]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:07:37.216 --> 01:07:41.518]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:07:41.738 --> 01:07:44.879]  I recommend doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:07:45.039 --> 01:07:48.080]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.120]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.041]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:52.121]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:07:52.141 --> 01:07:54.222]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:56.723]  And you support the broadcast.
[01:07:56.783 --> 01:07:57.883]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:58.123 --> 01:08:00.024]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:08:00.404 --> 01:08:02.365]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:13.310]  You want answers?
[01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:15.111]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:15.531 --> 01:08:25.653]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.934 --> 01:08:37.056]  Okay, I want to open the phones up, play a lot of Trump clips this hour, and talk about the Le Pen situation with her now at many polls ahead of the Macron globalists.
[01:08:37.076 --> 01:08:38.316]  This is very, very exciting.
[01:08:38.776 --> 01:08:40.577]  Those stories are up on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:42.611 --> 01:08:54.455]  I also want to get more into some video clips that are up on Infowars.com with Maxine Waters saying Trump's illegal immigration comments are racist dog whistles.
[01:08:56.856 --> 01:09:03.958]  They're also now saying again that anybody that makes the A-OK symbol is a white supremacist.
[01:09:05.239 --> 01:09:11.241]  And I guess it's supposed to say the three fingers mean white or like W and then
[01:09:13.652 --> 01:09:18.673]  I guess power and upside down P. Ladies and gentlemen, that's total schizophrenia.
[01:09:20.774 --> 01:09:24.735]  Total mental illness that the system's trying to give the public.
[01:09:26.576 --> 01:09:29.056]  Is the W hotel racist because it's a W?
[01:09:30.377 --> 01:09:33.478]  The W means W and the H means Hal Hitler.
[01:09:33.858 --> 01:09:34.598]  White Hitler!
[01:09:36.858 --> 01:09:37.879]  That sounds crazy, doesn't it?
[01:09:37.899 --> 01:09:38.679]  Because it is crazy.
[01:09:41.434 --> 01:09:46.438]  Some of my listeners think that when I do the A-OK sign, that I'm saying Illuminati.
[01:09:47.079 --> 01:09:48.220]  They claim that's Illuminati.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:55.686]  No, I grew up with it in Jell-O commercials, and there was some type of coconut milk in a can.
[01:09:55.706 --> 01:10:01.911]  I remember there was like a black guy, had a cool voice when I was a little kid, he'd go, coconuts, ah, ah, coconuts from Jamaica.
[01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:04.393]  Can somebody find that ad on YouTube?
[01:10:06.615 --> 01:10:09.097]  I bet if you go to YouTube and put in, ah, coconut,
[01:10:10.282 --> 01:10:11.322]  That we can find that ad.
[01:10:11.342 --> 01:10:13.883]  It was like... And then he started doing the Almond Joy ads, too.
[01:10:14.184 --> 01:10:17.925]  So he did coconut milk ads, he did Almond Joy, and that's how I got it in my head.
[01:10:18.245 --> 01:10:29.230]  And then Jell-O had ads throughout the 80s and stuff, and I was still a kid then, a teenager, where didn't Bill Cosby do that and say, mmm, delicious?
[01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:32.411]  The point is, it means A-OK.
[01:10:33.171 --> 01:10:39.274]  My dad, whenever something's A-OK, I'm like, hey, did I bring the right shingles up or the right hammer?
[01:10:40.578 --> 01:10:42.479]  Have nails in his mouth and he'd do A-OK.
[01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:46.640]  And it means in international sign language, A-OK.
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:57.923]  In fact, before I even give the number out and hit other news, let's play Paul Joseph Watson's report dealing with this because it just illustrates how crazy everything's gotten.
[01:10:58.323 --> 01:11:06.205]  It's up on Infowars.com because then Mike Cernovich got weak passes into the White House Press Corp.
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:11.963]  And he and another reporter went, hey, we got him.
[01:11:13.964 --> 01:11:15.786]  Obviously trolling the media, knowing they'd say that.
[01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:17.727]  But Trump does it all the time.
[01:11:17.968 --> 01:11:24.673]  When Trump says, I'm going to handle it, are you guaranteed we're going to end up cutting your taxes?
[01:11:24.693 --> 01:11:25.614]  That clip's coming up next.
[01:11:25.934 --> 01:11:29.257]  He was on a speech today saying, we're going to cut them, we're going to get the economy going.
[01:11:29.557 --> 01:11:32.740]  In all corporate language, that means it's handled.
[01:11:33.462 --> 01:11:36.504]  What I love about Trump's mannerisms is he waves his arms around like I do.
[01:11:36.984 --> 01:11:38.866]  I have pretty much the same mannerisms as Trump.
[01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:40.907]  I wasn't trained in mannerisms.
[01:11:40.967 --> 01:11:42.148]  I didn't go to college for it.
[01:11:43.129 --> 01:11:45.430]  I've had media people ask why I wave my arms around.
[01:11:46.431 --> 01:11:49.133]  I've had Italians come out so many times at my rallies and events.
[01:11:50.253 --> 01:11:57.618]  Even at my grandfather's funeral, I gave a speech and this Italian guy that was in his church came up and he goes, I love your grandpa, but by the way, are you Italian?
[01:11:57.638 --> 01:11:59.720]  Because you wave your arms around even more than we do.
[01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:02.563]  But that's just what I do!
[01:12:02.783 --> 01:12:03.463]  I can't help it.
[01:12:03.563 --> 01:12:04.564]  I talk with my hands.
[01:12:05.244 --> 01:12:07.586]  And Trump does the exact same mannerisms.
[01:12:08.666 --> 01:12:12.008]  I mean, I'm going back to videos I did 15 years ago, and it's this hand signal.
[01:12:13.029 --> 01:12:14.190]  It's this hand signal.
[01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:15.671]  It's that hand signal.
[01:12:15.751 --> 01:12:16.471]  It's the thumb.
[01:12:17.452 --> 01:12:19.033]  It's pointing.
[01:12:19.053 --> 01:12:19.933]  They say, don't point.
[01:12:20.293 --> 01:12:21.014]  People don't like it.
[01:12:21.914 --> 01:12:22.555]  Well, guess what?
[01:12:22.595 --> 01:12:23.095]  Trump points.
[01:12:23.135 --> 01:12:23.876]  They found it!
[01:12:25.356 --> 01:12:26.597]  They found the coconut guy.
[01:12:26.617 --> 01:12:27.598]  Was it for coconut milk?
[01:12:29.821 --> 01:12:30.321]  What is it for?
[01:12:30.341 --> 01:12:31.402]  Yeah, it's for coconut milk.
[01:12:33.723 --> 01:12:34.083]  What is it?
[01:12:35.944 --> 01:12:36.024]  7UP.
[01:12:36.124 --> 01:12:39.747]  Okay, see, I remembered, like, coconut milk or something.
[01:12:40.187 --> 01:12:41.327]  Or Almond Joy.
[01:12:42.148 --> 01:12:42.908]  Showing my memory.
[01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:46.230]  7UP, no caffeine, Jeffrey Holder.
[01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:47.751]  But I think he did ads for other people, too.
[01:12:47.991 --> 01:12:49.332]  Here, here, let's back him up and play this.
[01:12:49.352 --> 01:12:50.993]  Go ahead and start it from the beginning, please.
[01:12:55.155 --> 01:12:56.516]  Oh, there's no audio on that computer.
[01:12:56.556 --> 01:12:58.137]  Okay, well, as soon as you can download it, we'll play it.
[01:12:59.787 --> 01:13:01.748]  I just remember him doing the hand signs.
[01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:03.448]  Does he do it in the ad like I remember?
[01:13:05.849 --> 01:13:06.329]  He just did it.
[01:13:06.389 --> 01:13:07.170]  Okay, I missed that.
[01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.970]  See?
[01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:08.530]  Boom.
[01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:10.531]  From 40 years ago.
[01:13:10.611 --> 01:13:13.572]  I was like 3 years old when those ads were on.
[01:13:13.632 --> 01:13:14.092]  I remember.
[01:13:14.933 --> 01:13:16.353]  But I guess they ran through the 80s as well.
[01:13:18.434 --> 01:13:18.874]  On screen.
[01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:19.334]  There it is.
[01:13:19.374 --> 01:13:20.354]  Yeah.
[01:13:20.535 --> 01:13:20.975]  1983 commercial.
[01:13:20.995 --> 01:13:21.415]  7-Up.
[01:13:21.435 --> 01:13:22.075]  No caffeine.
[01:13:22.135 --> 01:13:24.356]  But it ran earlier than that as well because I remember him.
[01:13:25.555 --> 01:13:30.796]  I remember the house we lived on, and where the TV was, and I remember watching that ad on it all the time, and I remember it.
[01:13:30.816 --> 01:13:32.336]  Okay, I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:13:32.956 --> 01:13:38.097]  Here is Paul Joseph Watson's report, and people said, well this is silliness, why even cover it?
[01:13:39.518 --> 01:13:50.340]  Because the ADL, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, was set up in 1913 by the Jewish Mafia in New York.
[01:13:51.738 --> 01:13:54.900]  Because they kept getting in trouble, you know, Bugsy Siegel and people doing things.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:59.343]  And so they set it up to then go after anybody that ever criticized Jewish Mafia.
[01:13:59.783 --> 01:14:05.367]  And whenever I say that, it's all over the news that I'm this anti-Semite and I hate Jews, but then David Duke doesn't like me and the Nazis all hate me.
[01:14:05.587 --> 01:14:21.498]  Everybody knows I don't dislike Israel, I'm not anti-Jew, but there's Italian Mafia, there's Irish Mafia, there's Jewish Mafia, there's Jamaican Mafia, there's Russian Mafia, there's Japanese Mafia, there's Chinese Mafia, there's Taiwanese Mafia, there's Laotian Mafia, there's Mexican Mafia, there's Brazilian Mafia,
[01:14:21.758 --> 01:14:22.879]  There's Columbian Mafia.
[01:14:23.499 --> 01:14:26.561]  You don't dislike Columbians when you say they've got a really dangerous, mean mafia.
[01:14:26.581 --> 01:14:27.902]  They're just known to be dangerous and mean.
[01:14:28.602 --> 01:14:29.342]  Like anybody else.
[01:14:30.003 --> 01:14:35.366]  So, the ADL was set up by a guy named Jones, strangely enough.
[01:14:37.287 --> 01:14:38.148]  I've read the history of it.
[01:14:38.388 --> 01:14:39.088]  You can read it too.
[01:14:39.388 --> 01:14:40.049]  Mainline history.
[01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:43.691]  So like, go after anybody that criticizes the Jewish Mafia as anti-Semitic.
[01:14:45.239 --> 01:14:49.744]  And so then Nazi collaborators give him money, like George Soros, they give him awards.
[01:14:50.164 --> 01:14:51.426]  Arnold Schwarzenegger does.
[01:14:52.046 --> 01:15:02.758]  And every time the media, when I talk about the ADL and its bad past, or how they've lost lawsuits, or how they've been caught, you know, breaking into police departments and stealing files on people, I mean, they're a serious organization.
[01:15:03.418 --> 01:15:05.741]  They say, oh, he's anti-Semitic, he says he's Jewish mafia.
[01:15:07.381 --> 01:15:10.743]  Well yeah, the Jewish Mafia protects Nazis like George Soros, yes.
[01:15:11.044 --> 01:15:25.074]  So I'm not against Jews, I'm for Jews, that's why I'm exposing it, but the media will never report that I'm exposing the Jewish Mafia that in World War II worked with Hitler to shake Jews down who were trying to get out of Europe and who demanded a big stake and cut of the money.
[01:15:25.834 --> 01:15:29.877]  The ADL wasn't involved in that, but some of the Jewish Mafias in Europe were, like George Soros.
[01:15:31.638 --> 01:15:33.340]  They just cover up for the Jewish Mafia.
[01:15:34.386 --> 01:15:38.169]  And it's horrible to help round up Jews and send them to death camps like George Soros did.
[01:15:38.389 --> 01:15:43.052]  And if that's anti-Semitic, then I'm anti-Semitic because I don't support people that round up Jews and send them to death camps.
[01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:49.356]  But when I'm attacked in hundreds of newspapers tomorrow for saying that, they will not tell you what I said about the rest of it.
[01:15:51.197 --> 01:15:51.998]  And that's how it works.
[01:15:52.098 --> 01:15:53.138]  That's how it works in America.
[01:15:54.619 --> 01:15:55.880]  Because it's all pure deception.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:02.945]  You expose Arnold Schwarzenegger for loving Hitler, you expose George Soros for working with Hitler, helping round up Jews by the thousands, that's anti-Semitic.
[01:16:03.936 --> 01:16:04.758]  That's the ADL.
[01:16:05.299 --> 01:16:06.401]  What's that tell you about the ADL?
[01:16:06.441 --> 01:16:14.958]  Well, they've come out and said Mike Cernovich and the lady that he's with are anti-semitic because they said, A-OK, we got our passes.
[01:16:16.169 --> 01:16:19.851]  Because they've said Trump is anti-semitic for saying A-OK, and it's code word.
[01:16:19.911 --> 01:16:21.412]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied symbols.
[01:16:21.552 --> 01:16:24.653]  I never heard anybody until the last year say that's a white power symbol.
[01:16:25.274 --> 01:16:28.135]  That is the biggest load of baloney the earth has ever seen.
[01:16:28.455 --> 01:16:29.496]  It means A-OK.
[01:16:29.996 --> 01:16:40.482]  Is the black actor in the 7-Up commercial saying, delicious, I guess aspartame loaded, sugar free, you know, globalist garbage?
[01:16:41.772 --> 01:16:43.033]  He's saying it's A-OK.
[01:16:43.293 --> 01:16:44.033]  That's a symbol.
[01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:44.774]  Chefs do that.
[01:16:44.794 --> 01:16:48.656]  When they walk up, they say, you're gonna love this meal.
[01:16:49.156 --> 01:16:55.639]  In fact, if you do that symbol and then kiss your lips in French and Italian cuisine, it means it's the best out there.
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:56.440]  I haven't done this in a while.
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:59.682]  I'm gonna skip this break so we have more time with my beloved John Harmon up at GCN.
[01:17:00.222 --> 01:17:04.104]  So, let's go ahead and go to the evil report.
[01:17:05.265 --> 01:17:05.845]  Here it is.
[01:17:06.365 --> 01:17:07.526]  And then we'll show you the 7up ad.
[01:17:07.546 --> 01:17:07.806]  Here it is.
[01:17:10.450 --> 01:17:14.153]  Doing the OK hand sign now means you're a neo-Nazi.
[01:17:14.173 --> 01:17:21.979]  That's according to the Independent who published an entire article defaming Mike Cernovich and Cassandra Fairbanks as white supremacists.
[01:17:22.119 --> 01:17:28.484]  The same Independent that simultaneously writes hit pieces about me while begging for an interview.
[01:17:28.564 --> 01:17:36.490]  The article was based on a tweet by Fusion reporter Amanda Roller which said... Just two people doing a white power hand gesture in the White House.
[01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:41.914]  The Independent said, The Anti-Defamation League characterizes the symbol as a racist hand sign.
[01:17:42.035 --> 01:17:43.656]  And that's fake news.
[01:17:43.716 --> 01:17:49.441]  The ADL never said doing the OK symbol was a quote racist hand sign.
[01:17:49.501 --> 01:18:00.210]  They were talking about a completely different hand sign using two hands where one hand forms the letter W and the other hand forms the letter P to represent WP or white power.
[01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:04.814]  And the Independent is so stupid they literally debunk themselves
[01:18:05.074 --> 01:18:07.858]  In their own article by pointing this out.
[01:18:07.918 --> 01:18:09.741]  I don't know which is more retarded.
[01:18:09.781 --> 01:18:15.769]  Calling Cernovich a white supremacist when he has a Persian wife and a mixed-race baby.
[01:18:15.869 --> 01:18:17.511]  Pretty sh** white supremacist.
[01:18:17.591 --> 01:18:21.717]  Calling Cassandra Fairbanks a white supremacist when she's Puerto Rican.
[01:18:21.817 --> 01:18:31.883]  You're completely falling for a 4chan troll that set out to fool verified libtards on Twitter into thinking the OK sign had been co-opted by Neo-Nazis.
[01:18:31.963 --> 01:18:35.285]  That's literally what 4chan said, and they fell for it.
[01:18:35.345 --> 01:18:41.409]  The fact that I even have to explain this to you f***ing morons makes me want to kill myself.
[01:18:42.049 --> 01:18:47.131]  Trump does the OK sign when he's making a point.
[01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:49.471]  Hand gesture with an L shape.
[01:18:49.811 --> 01:18:50.692]  So it's right here.
[01:18:50.752 --> 01:18:51.752]  It looks precise.
[01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:52.992]  Not wishy-washy.
[01:18:53.052 --> 01:18:54.333]  He's got this nail.
[01:18:54.453 --> 01:19:01.195]  Just like other politicians do this thumb-to-fist thing when they're making a point.
[01:19:01.395 --> 01:19:06.596]  Trump does it to make a point, not to signal white supremacy.
[01:19:06.656 --> 01:19:08.977]  Cernovich, Fairbanks, and everyone else do it.
[01:19:09.597 --> 01:19:12.139]  Because they're Trump supporters.
[01:19:12.199 --> 01:19:16.341]  Not because they're white supremacists, you f***ing idiots!
[01:19:16.521 --> 01:19:18.983]  It's called a f***ing meme.
[01:19:19.083 --> 01:19:23.345]  Here's noted white supremacist Barack Obama doing the OK sign.
[01:19:23.385 --> 01:19:25.466]  This black Trump supporter does it too.
[01:19:25.687 --> 01:19:27.147]  Must be a white supremacist.
[01:19:27.187 --> 01:19:30.089]  This 10-year-old kid's definitely a white supremacist.
[01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:31.730]  Here's another white supremacist.
[01:19:31.890 --> 01:19:36.413]  Not all people who have a different opinion to you are white supremacists.
[01:19:36.753 --> 01:19:38.014]  Have you grasped that?
[01:19:38.294 --> 01:19:48.627]  Yet, unfortunately for Libtards, constantly smearing people as neo-Nazis because they're too thick to come up with an actual counter-argument is no longer an option.
[01:19:48.667 --> 01:19:56.057]  Fairbanks says she's suing the Independent and possibly the moron who first defamed her as a white supremacist in the tweet.
[01:19:56.297 --> 01:19:57.938]  We are suing the Independent.
[01:19:58.058 --> 01:19:58.978]  Independent out of the UK.
[01:19:59.018 --> 01:20:00.539]  And probably the journalist as well.
[01:20:00.579 --> 01:20:01.380]  You're going after her?
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.200]  She's a little bit, yeah.
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:03.000]  For slandering you.
[01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:03.621]  Yeah.
[01:20:03.641 --> 01:20:04.181]  Good for you.
[01:20:04.201 --> 01:20:06.822]  And possibly the woman from Fusion.
[01:20:07.243 --> 01:20:08.503]  And maybe even Fusion.
[01:20:08.823 --> 01:20:09.123]  Great.
[01:20:09.484 --> 01:20:10.564]  Um, for starting it.
[01:20:10.644 --> 01:20:10.944]  Listen.
[01:20:11.585 --> 01:20:13.946]  OK signs aren't racist.
[01:20:14.326 --> 01:20:16.107]  Milk isn't racist.
[01:20:16.467 --> 01:20:19.389]  Cartoon f*** frogs aren't racist.
[01:20:19.749 --> 01:20:21.430]  Not looking someone in the eye
[01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:26.353]  Isn't racist by trivializing racism to such a ludicrous degree?
[01:20:26.733 --> 01:20:35.440]  You make actual racists and white supremacists look reasonable in comparison to your hysterical idiocy.
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:38.082]  You utter cretins.
[01:20:39.991 --> 01:20:41.572]  That's Paul Watson for InfoWars.com.
[01:20:42.312 --> 01:20:43.733]  By the way, I make mistakes routinely.
[01:20:43.773 --> 01:20:45.714]  When I do, I own up to it.
[01:20:46.135 --> 01:20:47.235]  I hadn't watched Paul's report.
[01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:48.776]  I watch most of them, but I hadn't seen it yet.
[01:20:48.796 --> 01:20:49.637]  I just knew it would be good.
[01:20:50.137 --> 01:20:51.878]  So I played it, tying it into all this.
[01:20:52.338 --> 01:20:58.202]  I'd seen all the mainstream news articles the last month saying the ADL said that the OK sign was racist.
[01:20:59.042 --> 01:21:04.704]  And I do stand by what I said on other issues about the ADL, but I guess that was even too stupid for them.
[01:21:05.044 --> 01:21:08.546]  I guess now they've explained that that's not what they meant because it was so ridiculous.
[01:21:08.566 --> 01:21:11.387]  So this is even too out of control for the ADL.
[01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:18.209]  And by the way, the ADL has gone after real racist, you know, white supremacist, kill people, murder black groups.
[01:21:18.249 --> 01:21:18.709]  That's fine.
[01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:19.470]  Do that all day.
[01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:25.652]  But don't sit there and then paint everybody that you politically don't agree with on gun control or open borders as racist.
[01:21:26.741 --> 01:21:28.403]  It just doesn't hold water.
[01:21:28.704 --> 01:21:31.547]  Like calling Trump a racist in the news.
[01:21:31.567 --> 01:21:32.709]  I'm going to play that clip in a minute.
[01:21:32.749 --> 01:21:40.058]  Maxine Waters saying that he's racist and it's a code word and it's a dog whistle to say we've got to have a border.
[01:21:40.338 --> 01:21:43.142]  Does Mexico having a southern border and a southern fence?
[01:21:44.266 --> 01:21:45.246]  And deporting illegals?
[01:21:45.947 --> 01:21:48.207]  Does that mean they hate other Latin Americans?
[01:21:48.908 --> 01:21:49.188]  No!
[01:21:49.428 --> 01:21:54.930]  They understand those are poorer countries bringing crime and they can't just let unlimited, unvetted people in.
[01:21:55.130 --> 01:22:04.213]  That's why when I fly into Cancun or Puerto Vallarta to see those beautiful beaches and the great Mexican culture and the great food and the great art, when I go down there to get laid back,
[01:22:05.233 --> 01:22:06.273]  Because there is a laid-back vibe.
[01:22:06.834 --> 01:22:10.415]  When I go down to Isla Mujeres or wherever, I've got to fill out forms.
[01:22:10.435 --> 01:22:12.856]  I've got to say where I'm staying, what I'm doing, how long I'll be there.
[01:22:13.177 --> 01:22:17.819]  And if you stay a day or two longer, they call your hotel and say, why are you not here?
[01:22:17.839 --> 01:22:20.560]  And you get arrested or fined at the airport.
[01:22:24.502 --> 01:22:27.743]  Because Mexico's its own country, that's what countries do.
[01:22:29.804 --> 01:22:31.745]  Now, let's talk about what's really, really racist.
[01:22:33.655 --> 01:22:37.118]  Against the human race, our one race, what I covered last hour.
[01:22:37.298 --> 01:22:39.059]  Why is diet soda bad for your brain?
[01:22:39.159 --> 01:22:39.560]  Forbes.
[01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:40.580]  Aspartame.
[01:22:40.641 --> 01:22:43.603]  Making you fat, making you hungry, eating holes in your brain.
[01:22:43.843 --> 01:22:46.545]  Told you that 20 years ago from scientists and the documents.
[01:22:46.585 --> 01:22:47.486]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:22:47.866 --> 01:22:48.487]  Daily Mail.
[01:22:49.487 --> 01:22:53.110]  How the CIA put microphones and systems in cyborg cats.
[01:22:53.190 --> 01:22:55.312]  Now declassified from the 1960s.
[01:22:55.592 --> 01:22:56.633]  What do you think they're doing now?
[01:22:57.093 --> 01:22:57.954]  Silicon Valley.
[01:22:58.034 --> 01:22:58.555]  High fat.
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:05.081]  Diet, increasing life, increasing IQ, increasing health, everything we told you 20 years ago.
[01:23:05.642 --> 01:23:15.404]  SSRIs in the major JAMA neurology filing is causing massive brain hemorrhages and death and intracranial hemorrhaging.
[01:23:15.704 --> 01:23:19.925]  That's on InfoWars.com with links to all the major government news sites.
[01:23:24.846 --> 01:23:26.947]  Now, since we mentioned it, here's the seven up
[01:23:28.359 --> 01:23:33.242]  Commercial with the black actor from the 1970s and 80s.
[01:23:33.322 --> 01:23:34.843]  If you're a radio listener, I'll narrate it.
[01:23:35.284 --> 01:23:39.406]  Doing the OK sign to say it's high quality soda.
[01:23:39.446 --> 01:23:39.827]  Here it is.
[01:23:41.084 --> 01:23:42.365]  This is where they grow 7-Up.
[01:23:42.966 --> 01:23:47.389]  And from these, 7-Up gets its natural, light, refreshing taste.
[01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:49.631]  Crisp and clean, and no caffeine.
[01:23:49.871 --> 01:23:50.472]  Ha ha!
[01:23:50.932 --> 01:23:52.834]  Never had it, never will.
[01:23:53.034 --> 01:23:56.196]  Now you already know how much caffeine Pepsi and Coke have.
[01:23:56.797 --> 01:24:01.621]  But did you know that Mellow Yellow and Mountain View have even more caffeine?
[01:24:01.661 --> 01:24:05.224]  Now just try growing something like that around here.
[01:24:05.604 --> 01:24:06.745]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:24:06.925 --> 01:24:08.066]  Don't you feel good about 7-Up?
[01:24:11.283 --> 01:24:13.485]  Good healthy drink without the caffeine.
[01:24:13.525 --> 01:24:14.166]  Isn't that nice?
[01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:20.413]  And of course a few years later they started putting aspartame in other drinks, both Pepsi and of course Coca-Cola.
[01:24:20.653 --> 01:24:21.974]  That was Jeffrey Holder.
[01:24:21.994 --> 01:24:26.459]  According to the media, another noted white supremacist, because he had the double sign.
[01:24:26.479 --> 01:24:29.562]  And look, I know you know this is idiotic.
[01:24:29.602 --> 01:24:30.864]  You're probably sick of me talking about it.
[01:24:31.224 --> 01:24:32.646]  The reason I'm harping on it is
[01:24:34.696 --> 01:24:43.789]  They want to be able to take anything in language they want and declare it prasada non grata, to say it's not allowed, to say that you can't do it, to say that you can't have it.
[01:24:45.552 --> 01:24:47.655]  To say you can't have Halloween parties at colleges.
[01:24:49.053 --> 01:24:57.055]  To say you can't have a dorm named Lynch Hall because a rich Democrat gave money to build a hall because the word Lynch is in it.
[01:24:57.115 --> 01:25:01.156]  It triggers people to think of blacks being lynched, and so they remove the name.
[01:25:01.696 --> 01:25:03.436]  This is how they attack language.
[01:25:03.476 --> 01:25:04.697]  This is how they attack culture.
[01:25:05.417 --> 01:25:08.637]  Now I've got some Trump clips I want to get to, but I want to take your phone calls.
[01:25:09.278 --> 01:25:12.418]  Do you think Trump's selling us out in the first 102 days now?
[01:25:12.778 --> 01:25:15.379]  Or do you think he's done things that are amazing and unprecedented?
[01:25:16.325 --> 01:25:18.887]  What do you think about the North Korea situation I'm getting into?
[01:25:19.548 --> 01:25:29.136]  Also, Facebook has come out with some new information, so shocking that I personally didn't even know they were doing this, and I thought I was aware of all of the horrible things they're doing.
[01:25:29.156 --> 01:25:31.298]  I'll tell you about that at the start of the next segment.
[01:25:32.290 --> 01:25:32.890]  And much more.
[01:25:33.391 --> 01:25:41.034]  The toll-free number to join us, first-time callers, long-time callers, callers that agree, callers that disagree, all I ask is you have a good, clean phone line.
[01:25:41.274 --> 01:25:42.235]  We'd love to talk to you.
[01:25:42.255 --> 01:25:42.455]  800-259-9231.
[01:25:42.475 --> 01:25:42.515]  800-259-9231.
[01:25:42.535 --> 01:25:44.076]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:25:44.096 --> 01:25:44.156]  800-259-9231.
[01:25:44.336 --> 01:25:45.937]  Now let's go over a few issues here.
[01:25:45.957 --> 01:25:48.478]  It's been sold out for over a month and a half.
[01:25:48.498 --> 01:25:50.259]  As you know, it's our bestseller of all time.
[01:26:02.588 --> 01:26:11.138]  When it comes to the personal hygiene products, my dad is a retired, well he's not retired yet, but about to be a retired dentist and oral surgeon.
[01:26:11.619 --> 01:26:14.182]  He went to the biggest non-fluoride maker in the country.
[01:26:14.222 --> 01:26:15.764]  It's a household name, everybody knows it.
[01:26:16.024 --> 01:26:18.988]  It's a very northern state, but under our contract we can't say who.
[01:26:19.429 --> 01:26:20.991]  They then private label it for us.
[01:26:22.321 --> 01:26:28.265]  With the colloidal silver, with the iodine, and with the peppermint and tea tree oil.
[01:26:28.705 --> 01:26:34.809]  We have the children's that's basically sold out now, but more is coming in soon, that doesn't have the peppermint, so it's not as strong.
[01:26:35.089 --> 01:26:36.330]  This is concentrated.
[01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:40.092]  There's the equivalent basically of two tubes in each one when it comes to the ingredients.
[01:26:40.432 --> 01:26:41.353]  Doesn't have the fillers.
[01:26:42.013 --> 01:26:44.535]  It is now back in stock, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:58.636]  Super blue non-fluoride toothpaste and your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your family and your teeth, it funds this operation so that we can stand up against the globalists and their attacks to try to shut us down.
[01:26:58.676 --> 01:27:09.281]  And the good news is, being banned off Google Ads, being banned off AdRoll, being sued, being attacked, being demonized, we've got more audience, more listeners, and more funding.
[01:27:10.242 --> 01:27:14.185]  It's not substantively larger, but it's more than we would normally this time of year.
[01:27:14.565 --> 01:27:15.947]  So we can fund our operations.
[01:27:15.987 --> 01:27:20.210]  We've made up most of the millions of dollars we lost in the advertising they took away.
[01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:21.651]  But they're targeting everybody.
[01:27:22.392 --> 01:27:24.493]  They're targeting myself, Bill O'Reilly, you name it.
[01:27:24.533 --> 01:27:25.594]  Not that Bill did good things.
[01:27:25.634 --> 01:27:28.516]  I don't like Bill and I don't endorse what Bill did.
[01:27:28.536 --> 01:27:30.037]  I think Bill was a bully.
[01:27:30.057 --> 01:27:30.698]  He's bullied me.
[01:27:30.738 --> 01:27:31.439]  He's bullied others.
[01:27:31.899 --> 01:27:33.460]  But they targeted him.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:34.821]  Democrats can get away with murder.
[01:27:35.522 --> 01:27:37.764]  You know, it's not sexual harassment when you're a Democrat.
[01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:43.011]  And so, if they can get him, if they can get Limbaugh, if they can get Drudge, if they can get me, if they can get anybody.
[01:27:43.231 --> 01:27:44.852]  That's why you've seen Beck start to sell out.
[01:27:44.892 --> 01:27:46.012]  He knows the writing's on the wall.
[01:27:46.312 --> 01:27:47.613]  He believes he's joined with the elite.
[01:27:47.633 --> 01:27:49.273]  Of course, that destroyed him even faster.
[01:27:50.954 --> 01:27:55.855]  So, we're doing good in the face of the storms getting worse and the waves getting larger.
[01:27:56.636 --> 01:28:00.957]  But we're growing barely fast enough to keep the waves from coming over.
[01:28:02.324 --> 01:28:05.946]  So we need explosive support in the face of this.
[01:28:06.167 --> 01:28:08.288]  Everybody needs fluoride-free, high-quality toothpaste.
[01:28:08.748 --> 01:28:10.449]  Everybody needs the new Paul Watson shirt.
[01:28:10.489 --> 01:28:11.170]  Women really love it.
[01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:13.371]  Guys don't really want to wear a guy on them, do they?
[01:28:13.431 --> 01:28:13.912]  I know I don't.
[01:28:14.952 --> 01:28:17.374]  It says, uh, conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:28:18.635 --> 01:28:20.036]  Infowars.com on the back.
[01:28:20.716 --> 01:28:22.837]  And this triggers liberals everywhere.
[01:28:23.398 --> 01:28:28.261]  When they see this picture of Watson online, a lot of them copy it, a lot of them twist it, a lot of them defame it.
[01:28:29.667 --> 01:28:34.431]  Because they hate, you know, a good-looking person that's kind of the archetype of what trendies look like.
[01:28:34.452 --> 01:28:37.174]  You know, six-foot-four, good-looking guy like Watson.
[01:28:38.455 --> 01:28:41.879]  He kind of looks like, you know, somebody from one of those popular vampire movies in a good way.
[01:28:42.259 --> 01:28:43.700]  They cannot stand Paul.
[01:28:44.121 --> 01:28:45.082]  So it's a great way to trigger him.
[01:28:45.122 --> 01:28:46.443]  And the shirts are about to sell out.
[01:28:46.463 --> 01:28:51.067]  More are going to come in the next month, but I'm really blown away by how this is going to be maybe our best-selling shirt.
[01:28:51.107 --> 01:28:51.668]  Paul's right.
[01:28:52.028 --> 01:28:53.069]  So InfoWareStore.com.
[01:28:54.775 --> 01:29:00.137]  We've got to end the special today because I don't want to run out of the bone broth formula in the next two weeks before more comes in.
[01:29:00.197 --> 01:29:01.617]  Our sale's been too successful.
[01:29:01.677 --> 01:29:02.217]  It's turmeric.
[01:29:02.277 --> 01:29:02.897]  It's bone broth.
[01:29:02.957 --> 01:29:03.938]  It's chaga mushrooms.
[01:29:04.598 --> 01:29:05.738]  It's bee pollen.
[01:29:06.218 --> 01:29:08.259]  It's concentrated alfalfa protein.
[01:29:08.959 --> 01:29:10.640]  You talk about supercharging your body.
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:11.520]  You talk about energy.
[01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:13.121]  You talk about meal replacement.
[01:29:13.141 --> 01:29:14.221]  You talk about high quality.
[01:29:14.981 --> 01:29:17.162]  4.7 stars, 628 reviews.
[01:29:17.502 --> 01:29:18.563]  Go read them for yourself.
[01:29:18.843 --> 01:29:21.804]  Bone Broth, Ultimate Caveman Paleo.
[01:29:21.845 --> 01:29:22.785]  Couple scoops of this.
[01:29:23.445 --> 01:29:24.146]  Mix it in with milk.
[01:29:24.246 --> 01:29:24.866]  It tastes so good.
[01:29:24.886 --> 01:29:26.107]  Put in some ice cubes in the blender.
[01:29:26.407 --> 01:29:27.947]  My children think it's Ovaltine.
[01:29:28.428 --> 01:29:29.348]  Ovaltine isn't bad.
[01:29:29.368 --> 01:29:31.329]  It's got some vitamins and minerals in it, but they're mainly synthetic.
[01:29:31.649 --> 01:29:32.410]  Ours is amazing.
[01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:34.671]  It's the light year step after that.
[01:29:35.271 --> 01:29:38.893]  53% off, 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip on any item.
[01:29:39.353 --> 01:29:42.935]  It's a loss leader when you sign up for AutoShip and it funds our operation.
[01:29:43.195 --> 01:29:44.715]  Caveman, 53% off.
[01:29:45.276 --> 01:29:49.998]  And we've got 33% off on the liver shield, but only for another day or two.
[01:29:50.018 --> 01:29:51.338]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:29:52.039 --> 01:29:52.939]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.439 --> 01:29:55.040]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.961 --> 01:29:58.662]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.274 --> 01:30:05.456]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[01:30:05.836 --> 01:30:17.847]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[01:30:17.867 --> 01:30:23.011]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies.
[01:30:23.031 --> 01:30:24.172]  You can look them up for yourself.
[01:30:24.853 --> 01:30:34.559]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[01:30:34.699 --> 01:30:40.863]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[01:30:41.743 --> 01:30:43.584]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[01:30:44.585 --> 01:30:45.786]  People are falling apart.
[01:30:45.806 --> 01:30:47.347]  They're totally depressed and unhappy.
[01:30:47.927 --> 01:30:48.908]  What is going on?
[01:30:50.168 --> 01:30:54.031]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[01:30:55.253 --> 01:30:57.836]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[01:30:58.216 --> 01:30:59.918]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:31:00.118 --> 01:31:07.146]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:31:07.366 --> 01:31:15.695]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[01:31:17.088 --> 01:31:23.591]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[01:31:23.972 --> 01:31:27.393]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:31:27.433 --> 01:31:30.555]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[01:31:31.155 --> 01:31:36.238]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:31:36.778 --> 01:31:39.919]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:31:40.219 --> 01:31:50.644]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[01:31:50.764 --> 01:31:52.204]  The bone is so amazing.
[01:31:52.625 --> 01:31:58.227]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[01:31:59.349 --> 01:32:02.271]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[01:32:02.811 --> 01:32:08.234]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[01:32:08.514 --> 01:32:17.998]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[01:32:18.259 --> 01:32:22.821]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[01:32:23.061 --> 01:32:24.862]  This is a absolute win-win.
[01:32:24.902 --> 01:32:27.682]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[01:32:27.963 --> 01:32:34.084]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[01:32:35.385 --> 01:32:44.067]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:44.288 --> 01:32:48.669]  Three years in the making, incredible research, and the very best ingredients.
[01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:51.810]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:55.801]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[01:32:56.201 --> 01:32:59.662]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[01:33:08.164 --> 01:33:10.245]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:10.285 --> 01:33:14.546]  Because there is a war on, or you're mine.
[01:33:14.886 --> 01:33:18.287]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[01:33:23.939 --> 01:33:24.599]  I just knew too much.
[01:33:24.619 --> 01:33:25.480]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:33:49.219 --> 01:33:50.279]  We're going to your phone calls.
[01:33:50.359 --> 01:33:56.201]  James, Ron, Skits, Beto, Jessica, and many others on the other side.
[01:33:56.221 --> 01:33:59.461]  800-259-9231 is the number.
[01:34:01.962 --> 01:34:05.403]  Climate change rally in Colorado postponed after monster snowstorm.
[01:34:06.123 --> 01:34:13.244]  I saw a very powerful film, The Promise, this weekend about the Armenian genocide that I want to do a proper review of the next few days.
[01:34:14.585 --> 01:34:15.985]  But I also saw the ad.
[01:34:17.571 --> 01:34:27.558]  Here in the trailers for the new inconvenient fraud by the bloated liar in chief, Al Gore.
[01:34:28.579 --> 01:34:30.040]  And I'm going to do a review today.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:36.245]  I'm going to shoot a review in HD at the end of the broadcast that we will premiere tomorrow on the show.
[01:34:38.466 --> 01:34:44.671]  Because everything they say in the dramatic intro is a lie.
[01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:46.220]  And as a fraud.
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:48.781]  So I'm going to be covering that tomorrow.
[01:34:49.822 --> 01:34:50.582]  So that's coming up.
[01:34:54.383 --> 01:34:56.844]  But it just bills Al Gore as the savior of the world.
[01:34:57.725 --> 01:34:59.705]  And of course, pay him carbon taxes, he'll save you.
[01:35:00.266 --> 01:35:14.171]  While they ignore all the real threats, the GMO, the genetic engineering, the chimeras, the geoengineering that's going on, all the really bad things the globalists are doing on purpose to change the biological makeup of the planet.
[01:35:16.104 --> 01:35:18.146]  Human-animal chimeras are gestating on U.S.
[01:35:18.186 --> 01:35:18.726]  research farms.
[01:35:19.086 --> 01:35:20.167]  Will you guys print me that again?
[01:35:20.207 --> 01:35:24.070]  Because when I cut this piece today about Al Gore, that ties into it.
[01:35:24.150 --> 01:35:37.980]  I'm going to show my press conference Friday, where everybody from the Huffington Post to the Daily Beast to the Austin American States, when they all laughed at me, and NBC laughed at me, and they all giggled and said, he's crazy.
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:40.462]  He thinks they're crossing humans with animals.
[01:35:44.005 --> 01:35:50.111]  And then one writer said, oh, sure, we're injecting human cells into pigs.
[01:35:50.131 --> 01:35:50.171]  No!
[01:35:51.252 --> 01:35:53.575]  They're creating part human, part pigs.
[01:35:53.675 --> 01:35:54.876]  Part human, part monkey.
[01:35:55.116 --> 01:35:56.318]  Part human, part fish.
[01:35:57.622 --> 01:36:05.469]  Part fish, part insect, and it's crossing the genetic line of diseases that previously only insects got, humans wouldn't get.
[01:36:06.150 --> 01:36:08.111]  Or if a pig could get something, we couldn't get it.
[01:36:08.171 --> 01:36:16.699]  It's called zoological diseases and zoological viruses and zoological bacterium that we were never affected by.
[01:36:19.021 --> 01:36:19.882]  Zoological!
[01:36:20.142 --> 01:36:21.043]  Other than human!
[01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:28.071]  Everyone I know in Austin, everyone can barely breathe now.
[01:36:28.891 --> 01:36:30.672]  I grew up in Texas, I was born here.
[01:36:34.533 --> 01:36:45.017]  I know at least 10 people close to me that can't get out of bed who have their heads spinning right now.
[01:36:46.457 --> 01:36:49.778]  Who have, what's the scientific term of it?
[01:36:49.798 --> 01:36:52.199]  I'm having one of those brain, brain you know what's.
[01:36:53.635 --> 01:36:53.735]  It's
[01:37:10.151 --> 01:37:13.574]  Because the pollen is so bad, they're getting year-round vertigo.
[01:37:13.854 --> 01:37:15.836]  And I mean, these aren't hypochondriacs.
[01:37:15.856 --> 01:37:17.277]  These are people that run marathons.
[01:37:17.697 --> 01:37:19.399]  These are people that are high-powered lawyers.
[01:37:19.859 --> 01:37:21.640]  These are people that are super smart.
[01:37:22.421 --> 01:37:24.042]  And people are leaving Austin.
[01:37:24.283 --> 01:37:25.604]  In fact, I've said this many times.
[01:37:27.389 --> 01:37:27.849]  There it is.
[01:37:27.989 --> 01:37:28.970]  Allergies and dizziness.
[01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:30.310]  The cause and the treatment.
[01:37:30.731 --> 01:37:31.591]  That's not a health line.
[01:37:31.611 --> 01:37:32.992]  And it's getting worse and worse.
[01:37:33.072 --> 01:37:35.033]  No one had this 30, 40 years ago.
[01:37:35.733 --> 01:37:36.673]  It's the GMO.
[01:37:36.754 --> 01:37:40.775]  It's triggering autoimmune responses, where now the natural environment is killing us.
[01:37:41.436 --> 01:37:45.218]  It's like that movie, The Happening, where the trees start killing everybody.
[01:37:48.019 --> 01:37:48.899]  I went to Hawaii.
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:50.220]  Zero allergies.
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:52.081]  I got off the plane sick in 10 minutes.
[01:37:55.219 --> 01:37:57.241]  I go to the desert somewhere, no allergies.
[01:37:57.341 --> 01:38:00.684]  I come back here, used to be a month out of the year, then two months.
[01:38:00.744 --> 01:38:07.951]  Now, I've been dealing with allergies for six months, and if I wasn't drinking more water and taking X2 and things, it'd be even worse.
[01:38:08.912 --> 01:38:09.853]  Because I'm doing okay.
[01:38:10.574 --> 01:38:12.355]  I just get headaches and sneeze and feel crappy.
[01:38:12.375 --> 01:38:13.156]  I just bull through it.
[01:38:13.176 --> 01:38:14.597]  A lot of people can't bull through it.
[01:38:15.658 --> 01:38:19.162]  But I'll tell you, if I start getting vertigo and dizzy like a lot of people are getting, I gotta go!
[01:38:24.827 --> 01:38:26.208]  My son's in super good shape.
[01:38:26.928 --> 01:38:28.009]  Exercises all the time.
[01:38:28.289 --> 01:38:29.209]  Taller than I am.
[01:38:30.690 --> 01:38:32.091]  And he's had vertigo for two days.
[01:38:33.571 --> 01:38:33.892]  In bed.
[01:38:36.673 --> 01:38:37.273]  From allergies.
[01:38:38.054 --> 01:38:38.754]  Took him to the doctor.
[01:38:41.855 --> 01:38:43.816]  And I'm saying this isn't natural, folks.
[01:38:43.877 --> 01:38:44.417]  It isn't normal.
[01:38:44.717 --> 01:38:46.438]  You look at people and they look sick.
[01:38:46.838 --> 01:38:48.159]  They look weirded out everywhere.
[01:38:49.022 --> 01:38:49.882]  They look like zombies.
[01:38:49.902 --> 01:38:50.803]  You hear the conversations.
[01:38:50.863 --> 01:38:51.723]  It's super dumbed down.
[01:38:52.284 --> 01:38:53.924]  And it's just getting worse and worse.
[01:38:53.964 --> 01:38:58.367]  I talk to people all over New York, Kentucky, Tennessee, California.
[01:38:58.387 --> 01:38:59.727]  They've all got super bad allergies.
[01:38:59.968 --> 01:39:03.469]  And they say, yeah, just a few years ago, I wasn't sick like this all the time.
[01:39:03.809 --> 01:39:04.950]  I don't know what's going on.
[01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:07.371]  Well, something's going on, people!
[01:39:11.133 --> 01:39:12.294]  And where are all the elites moving?
[01:39:12.334 --> 01:39:14.675]  Tasmania and Kauai.
[01:39:17.588 --> 01:39:26.015]  And they're very controlled there through the government of Australia and the state government of Hawaii.
[01:39:26.235 --> 01:39:28.997]  They won't let any other new plants in, no new stuff.
[01:39:30.298 --> 01:39:34.021]  They said you do basically decontamination when you come in and there's a reason the elite are going there.
[01:39:36.843 --> 01:39:37.644]  And it gets worse than that.
[01:39:39.241 --> 01:39:50.105]  They've got pharmacological farms growing all over the United States where for 30 years they can program crops like corn to produce live vaccines, chemicals, anything they want.
[01:39:50.405 --> 01:39:51.245]  Plants are magic.
[01:39:51.486 --> 01:39:55.727]  You can program them to grow basically anything you want.
[01:39:57.308 --> 01:39:58.888]  The problem is they're giving off pollen.
[01:39:59.108 --> 01:40:00.009]  The bees are getting it.
[01:40:00.089 --> 01:40:00.709]  They're dying.
[01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:02.950]  They're spreading it to other plants.
[01:40:04.045 --> 01:40:07.686]  They are now seeing things like corn growing out of oak trees in Texas.
[01:40:08.066 --> 01:40:09.046]  That never happened before.
[01:40:09.426 --> 01:40:30.572]  But they've spliced the corn with so many other genetics of plants and animals and other insects that it's now jumping species into other animals and jumping in the same, I guess, plant kingdom in the flora
[01:40:31.778 --> 01:40:35.302]  And it's now jumping within the flora family into other plants.
[01:40:37.505 --> 01:40:41.869]  And it's getting exponentially worse, and I'm like, why are they doing this?
[01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:43.371]  Why are they geoengineering?
[01:40:43.451 --> 01:40:44.472]  Why are they poisoning?
[01:40:44.773 --> 01:40:47.135]  Why are they releasing all these GMO things in the open?
[01:40:47.456 --> 01:40:48.257]  Why are they doing it?
[01:40:48.277 --> 01:40:49.418]  And you can see the result.
[01:40:49.518 --> 01:40:50.619]  It's killing everything!
[01:40:51.434 --> 01:40:54.296]  The plants are dying, the insects are dying, the birds are dying.
[01:40:54.736 --> 01:40:56.598]  You go to big forests all over the U.S.
[01:40:56.638 --> 01:40:57.638]  now, they're like quiet.
[01:40:58.039 --> 01:41:06.965]  I talked to the Forest Service people, I talked to the biologists, I talked to the animal biologists, I talked to everybody and they say, something's going on.
[01:41:07.365 --> 01:41:13.750]  Aluminum is up ten times or more on average in places like California in the soil and people don't know why.
[01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:19.334]  They're spraying it out of the jet fuel, it's added to the jet fuel, it's been declassified.
[01:41:23.362 --> 01:41:29.427]  And I'm sitting here talking about this, covering it, and Trevor Noah makes jokes about it.
[01:41:30.368 --> 01:41:52.365]  When I can type in right now, Council on Foreign Relations, Geoengineering of Planet Earth, NASA, Geoengineering of Planet Earth, Energy Department sprays barium salts, aluminum dioxide, patents, patents for spraying, for adding aluminum dioxide, barium salts to jet fuel for aerosol distribution to create a sunscreen to stop global warming.
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:42:00.343]  You'll read patents, you'll read UN reports, and you'll read the Energy Department saying they're doing it now!
[01:42:02.143 --> 01:42:19.810]  And something I've noticed, because used to, just 15 years ago and on, no matter what time of year it was, so-called condensation trails, even during the summer at low altitude, now, have you noticed suddenly since Trump got in, that chemtrails are down like 90%?
[01:42:20.250 --> 01:42:22.251]  In fact, I haven't been seeing any of them.
[01:42:23.513 --> 01:42:25.153]  Not in the winter when they're supposed to be forming?
[01:42:25.994 --> 01:42:28.754]  Airplane contrails may be creating accidental geoengineering.
[01:42:29.115 --> 01:42:29.995]  That's the Sisonian.
[01:42:30.195 --> 01:42:31.235]  That's their little whitewash.
[01:42:31.455 --> 01:42:33.076]  Oh, they're accidentally creating it.
[01:42:33.176 --> 01:42:33.476]  No.
[01:42:33.816 --> 01:42:41.398]  When they add barium salt, aluminum dioxide, or other radioactive isotopes, it creates artificial nuclei and then forms cloud banks.
[01:42:41.458 --> 01:42:42.538]  It's called cloud seeding.
[01:42:43.438 --> 01:42:44.019]  I'm digressing.
[01:42:44.059 --> 01:42:45.039]  I said I'd go to your phone calls.
[01:42:46.699 --> 01:42:48.720]  But first, because I mentioned it, let me play
[01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:53.033]  Because they're demonizing the AOK Sinus White Power.
[01:42:53.513 --> 01:42:54.974]  They're demonizing all languages evil.
[01:42:55.555 --> 01:43:02.160]  Now we have Maxine Waters saying Trump's illegal immigration comments are racist and a dog whistle.
[01:43:02.601 --> 01:43:04.542]  Lady, the one pushing racism is you.
[01:43:05.803 --> 01:43:08.786]  And pushing war with Russia, saying Russia invaded Korea.
[01:43:09.306 --> 01:43:15.612]  I mean, you're as dumb and out of touch as Nancy Pelosi, who said George W. Bush was president again on Sunday!
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:19.261]  Who are these dingbats?
[01:43:20.101 --> 01:43:21.481]  Retire already, lady!
[01:43:21.641 --> 01:43:25.342]  But you didn't know where Russia was on a map 50 years ago, did you, Pelosi?
[01:43:25.923 --> 01:43:26.643]  Did you, Waters?
[01:43:26.983 --> 01:43:30.804]  You're a bunch of rich ladies put in there by the elites because you'll do whatever you're told!
[01:43:34.105 --> 01:43:34.745]  Let's play the clip.
[01:43:36.126 --> 01:43:42.628]  I want to let you listen to Donald Trump last night at his Pennsylvania rally, going back at this issue of immigration with his supporters.
[01:43:42.648 --> 01:43:43.008]  Take a listen.
[01:43:46.332 --> 01:43:50.536]  Year after year, you pleaded for Washington to enforce our laws.
[01:43:51.217 --> 01:44:00.686]  As illegal immigration surged, refugees flooded in, and lax vetting threatened your families' safety and security.
[01:44:03.129 --> 01:44:09.195]  Your pleas have finally been... Oh, don't worry, we're gonna have the wall.
[01:44:09.215 --> 01:44:10.076]  Don't worry about it.
[01:44:13.854 --> 01:44:14.935]  Your response, Congresswoman?
[01:44:15.756 --> 01:44:18.078]  That is absolutely racist.
[01:44:18.758 --> 01:44:20.280]  That's that dog whistling.
[01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:28.026]  That's saying to people, this is what is happening in America with you and all the problems that we have.
[01:44:28.306 --> 01:44:34.592]  He's using the Latino population and Mexicans right across the border.
[01:44:35.754 --> 01:44:42.316]  To create fear in his constituency and those people who tend to want to believe that.
[01:44:42.756 --> 01:44:44.396]  It is absolutely divisive.
[01:44:44.816 --> 01:44:52.658]  No leader, no president should be saying and doing the kinds of things that he's doing just to keep a constituency together.
[01:44:52.959 --> 01:44:53.699]  It's outrageous.
[01:44:54.839 --> 01:44:56.339]  The Democrats are the party of the KKK.
[01:44:56.359 --> 01:44:57.400]  They're the one race baiting.
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:58.760]  We can't have a totally open border.
[01:44:58.820 --> 01:44:59.520]  Nobody has that.
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:00.260]  That's a free country.
[01:45:00.621 --> 01:45:02.121]  We can't just have unvetted coming in.
[01:45:03.356 --> 01:45:10.098]  And we've had a 53% or 43% drop in illegals coming in just the last few months since President Trump got in.
[01:45:11.358 --> 01:45:12.498]  She's the one race baiting.
[01:45:12.718 --> 01:45:19.340]  But I love how the reporter acts like they caught, you know, juniors stealing money out of mama's purse.
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:22.741]  The other reporter says, what do you think of this?
[01:45:22.901 --> 01:45:27.142]  Like, boy, we caught him saying something amazing that our country could actually have a border.
[01:45:28.462 --> 01:45:31.283]  That's the disgusting nature of this brainwashing.
[01:45:31.703 --> 01:45:32.863]  But since we're playing Trump clips,
[01:45:34.841 --> 01:45:36.421]  Let's go to one more of these.
[01:45:36.521 --> 01:45:41.723]  Trump mocks White House Correspondents Dinner at the PA rally that mesmerized folks over the weekend.
[01:45:42.643 --> 01:45:45.804]  Let's play this clip and then I'm going right to Ron and other callers.
[01:45:45.844 --> 01:45:46.224]  Here it is.
[01:45:47.364 --> 01:45:54.286]  As you may know, there's another big gathering taking place tonight in Washington, D.C.
[01:45:54.346 --> 01:45:55.186]  Did you hear about it?
[01:46:00.678 --> 01:46:02.099]  Yeah, Trump didn't show up to that.
[01:46:02.119 --> 01:46:03.640]  Just plunged its ratings.
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:11.505]  A large group of Hollywood actors... Everybody's so sick of Hollywood.
[01:46:12.126 --> 01:46:13.166]  Being a celebrity sucks.
[01:46:13.206 --> 01:46:24.534]  ...Washington media... ...are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation's capital right now.
[01:46:24.794 --> 01:46:25.274]  That's right.
[01:46:26.415 --> 01:46:27.776]  Remember him laughing at Trump a year ago?
[01:46:28.296 --> 01:46:28.977]  Not laughing now.
[01:46:30.936 --> 01:46:38.259]  They are gathered together for the White House Correspondents' Dinner without the President.
[01:46:47.103 --> 01:46:57.727]  And I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from Washington's swamp
[01:46:58.732 --> 01:46:59.332]  Exactly.
[01:46:59.512 --> 01:47:02.693]  Who wants to be part of these elites and their power trips?
[01:47:02.713 --> 01:47:04.154]  Spending an evening with all of you.
[01:47:04.574 --> 01:47:05.294]  Their arrogance.
[01:47:05.454 --> 01:47:10.456]  And with a much, much larger crowd and much better people.
[01:47:10.616 --> 01:47:10.856]  Right?
[01:47:11.216 --> 01:47:11.636]  That's right.
[01:47:11.937 --> 01:47:16.978]  This is all about the elites being a joke, royalty being a joke, the new royalty, Hollywood being a joke.
[01:47:17.298 --> 01:47:20.500]  They set themselves up as if they're the controllers of culture.
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:21.520]  They're losing control.
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:22.680]  They can't stand it.
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:25.501]  That's why they want to destroy me, you, Trump, everybody.
[01:47:26.021 --> 01:47:27.142]  Trump's far from perfect.
[01:47:27.702 --> 01:47:32.364]  He's being pushed into confrontation with Russia, Syria, North Korea's belligerent.
[01:47:32.424 --> 01:47:33.104]  That's a problem.
[01:47:33.584 --> 01:47:34.784]  But he's got to stand up to North Korea.
[01:47:36.705 --> 01:47:40.666]  But on the economy... The media back there, they would actually rather be here.
[01:47:40.987 --> 01:47:41.867]  I have to tell you.
[01:47:41.887 --> 01:47:44.768]  Oh yeah, most of the camera folks are with us.
[01:47:44.788 --> 01:47:46.368]  This is about populism, folks.
[01:47:46.769 --> 01:47:47.529]  It's bigger than Trump.
[01:47:47.989 --> 01:47:49.429]  It's about breaking with the system.
[01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:50.650]  Breaking with the elites.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:02.080]  Build that wall.
[01:48:03.201 --> 01:48:05.401]  Which, by the way, they got a lot of Mexican contractors and U.S.
[01:48:05.441 --> 01:48:06.202]  contractors wanting to build it.
[01:48:06.222 --> 01:48:07.262]  I say, let Mexico help build it.
[01:48:08.162 --> 01:48:09.963]  Mexico's got its own fence and wall down there.
[01:48:10.043 --> 01:48:10.423]  They better.
[01:48:10.443 --> 01:48:11.503]  Guatemala's collapsed.
[01:48:12.584 --> 01:48:16.865]  Like CNN and MSNBC are fake news.
[01:48:17.245 --> 01:48:17.585]  They are.
[01:48:17.605 --> 01:48:18.705]  They're enemies.
[01:48:18.965 --> 01:48:19.926]  Enemies of the American people.
[01:48:21.106 --> 01:48:23.547]  And then Gergen says, oh, he's so hateful, the most divisive.
[01:48:23.667 --> 01:48:26.468]  And they're wishing.
[01:48:28.186 --> 01:48:30.067]  In Washington, they're watching.
[01:48:30.207 --> 01:48:31.387]  Right now, they're watching.
[01:48:31.768 --> 01:48:34.669]  And they would love to be with us right here tonight.
[01:48:35.209 --> 01:48:35.669]  Absolutely.
[01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:37.330]  He must be around a bunch of fake mummies.
[01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:42.992]  But they're trapped at the dinner, which will be very, very boring.
[01:48:44.073 --> 01:48:44.513]  That's right.
[01:48:44.553 --> 01:48:45.733]  Most people that work for the system.
[01:48:45.913 --> 01:48:47.514]  But next year... Hate it.
[01:48:47.994 --> 01:48:53.436]  Maybe we'll make it more exciting for them in Washington and we'll show up.
[01:48:53.757 --> 01:48:56.838]  But we have a good chance of showing up here again next year, too.
[01:48:58.749 --> 01:48:59.109]  That's right.
[01:48:59.269 --> 01:49:00.550]  Take the power away from them.
[01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:08.894]  Stop letting MSM dictate where you have a rally, or what you do, or where you go, or who you talk to, or, oh my gosh, the MSM's attacking you.
[01:49:09.114 --> 01:49:10.594]  The MSM's calling you all these names.
[01:49:10.875 --> 01:49:13.556]  The MSM is doing nothing but trying to destroy you and your family.
[01:49:13.876 --> 01:49:15.217]  That's because they're scum!
[01:49:15.777 --> 01:49:18.938]  You've got to call their bluff and let yourself have the fight with them.
[01:49:21.359 --> 01:49:22.140]  They're not real.
[01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:22.780]  They're fake.
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:24.381]  That's why they call us fake all day.
[01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:26.931]  Alright, let's go to James in California.
[01:49:26.951 --> 01:49:29.512]  We'll go to Ron, Skits, Beto, Jessica, and others.
[01:49:29.913 --> 01:49:31.253]  James, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:49:32.674 --> 01:49:33.434]  Oh, hello Alex.
[01:49:33.935 --> 01:49:42.859]  I've been a listener since your appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast, and I just wanted to say how great it is to hear someone else who understands the real dangers of aspartame.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:52.124]  Growing up, my family always warned me about the dangers of it, saying how it would, like, give you cancer, give you all those tumors like you were mentioning, and
[01:49:54.150 --> 01:49:59.953]  I don't think like a lot of the people really understand how it really is the silent killer for most people.
[01:49:59.993 --> 01:50:07.818]  Like you can see the outward effects like obesity that's killing millions of people every year and it's just really concerning to see.
[01:50:07.838 --> 01:50:11.680]  Well that's right and it's not like I just guessed 22 years ago exposing it.
[01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:15.763]  People were exposing it when it was made legal back in 1981 since day one.
[01:50:15.803 --> 01:50:17.223]  They couldn't get it approved in the 70s.
[01:50:17.584 --> 01:50:20.325]  People have been fighting this since the 70s when it was invented.
[01:50:20.725 --> 01:50:22.667]  They had developed a type of bacteria
[01:50:23.487 --> 01:50:24.707]  They could eat toxic waste.
[01:50:25.368 --> 01:50:33.330]  And I noticed the GMO bacteria then would excrete or defecate out aspartame, a sweet tasting poison.
[01:50:33.770 --> 01:50:34.590]  It's very addictive.
[01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:40.752]  So it's like a science fiction movie, a sweet tasting poison from a GMO bacteria that they put in everything now.
[01:50:41.112 --> 01:50:44.773]  I'm going to come back and let you finish up, James, because I went to your call a little bit late.
[01:50:45.213 --> 01:50:46.514]  We'll come back and talk more about that.
[01:50:46.594 --> 01:50:56.337]  So, I wasn't a trailblazer exposing Aspartame, but it's one more thing now in Forbes, everywhere admitting it makes you fat, gives you brain tumors, kills you, just like Prozac.
[01:50:56.857 --> 01:50:57.397]  Thank you, James.
[01:50:57.417 --> 01:50:58.438]  We'll come right back to you.
[01:50:58.518 --> 01:50:58.918]  Stay with us.
[01:51:03.234 --> 01:51:15.806]  Although conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of showing up to her already canceled speech at Berkeley, that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans from conducting a large First Amendment rally in its place.
[01:51:16.046 --> 01:51:23.773]  Prominent social media icons such as Gavin McInnes, Lauren Southern, Based Stickman, Baked Alaska, Brittany Pettibone, and
[01:51:23.953 --> 01:51:28.317]  Faith Goldie showed up to support free speech and gave speeches.
[01:51:28.558 --> 01:51:37.447]  Reports that the Berkeley Police did their job in protecting the peace have come in, and apparently a total of six Antifa protesters were arrested.
[01:51:37.687 --> 01:51:43.193]  Two for resisting arrest, one for a drug violation, and another for possessing a weapon.
[01:51:43.533 --> 01:51:51.903]  Two more arrests were made earlier in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police.
[01:51:52.163 --> 01:51:57.991]  Despite these arrests, the protests remained peaceful and dialogue between both sides was present.
[01:51:58.231 --> 01:52:01.375]  This is Millie Weaver reporting to you for InfoWars.com.
[01:52:02.992 --> 01:52:05.955]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[01:52:06.235 --> 01:52:15.843]  Introducing Deep Cleanze by InfoWarsLife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[01:52:16.143 --> 01:52:21.327]  Using our proprietary multi-step extraction technology, Deep Cleanze is our most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[01:52:21.427 --> 01:52:30.275]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[01:52:30.535 --> 01:52:39.119]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:46.263]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spigerex herbal processing technique.
[01:52:46.403 --> 01:52:51.746]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you with the best
[01:52:53.106 --> 01:53:09.091]  The reason InfoWarsLife has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[01:53:09.251 --> 01:53:09.831]  I take this.
[01:53:10.091 --> 01:53:11.131]  My family takes this.
[01:53:11.211 --> 01:53:15.473]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[01:53:15.513 --> 01:53:19.714]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:53:20.114 --> 01:53:24.657]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:53:24.757 --> 01:53:25.798]  I don't feel good.
[01:53:25.878 --> 01:53:29.400]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:32.282]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:53:32.342 --> 01:53:37.646]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:53:38.126 --> 01:53:40.548]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:53:41.088 --> 01:53:44.550]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[01:53:44.630 --> 01:53:46.812]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:53:46.872 --> 01:53:47.232]  I love it.
[01:53:47.372 --> 01:53:49.976]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:53:50.177 --> 01:53:51.158]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:53:51.199 --> 01:53:56.828]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:53:56.848 --> 01:53:58.791]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:53:59.032 --> 01:53:59.793]  It's a win-win.
[01:54:00.274 --> 01:54:01.075]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:54:13.715 --> 01:54:14.795]  Roger Stone just called.
[01:54:14.835 --> 01:54:17.758]  He's got really big breaking news at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:54:17.778 --> 01:54:19.239]  We're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:54:19.279 --> 01:54:21.200]  Steve Pucinich's popping in as well.
[01:54:22.221 --> 01:54:31.688]  We want to know why they're coming after us, why they're trying to shut us down, why the Federal Reserve Board itself, one of their top national members on the New York Fed that runs it, is suing me.
[01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:34.581]  We're upsetting their whole system.
[01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:52.235]  Dr. Corsi is getting intel from the White House daily, posting articles that get no attention because they're so powerful, where Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac got looted by Republican senators and Democrats and Obama, where they actually stole now upwards of $300 billion.
[01:54:53.776 --> 01:54:58.440]  That's why they hate us, because they're scared some of these big stories will actually end up getting out.
[01:54:59.707 --> 01:55:04.890]  Treasury Secretary confirms Infowars.com reporting on Obamacare looting scheme theft.
[01:55:05.811 --> 01:55:07.392]  Oh yeah, how do you think they confirm?
[01:55:07.412 --> 01:55:09.293]  Because the White House points this out to us.
[01:55:09.593 --> 01:55:10.494]  We go get the documents.
[01:55:10.514 --> 01:55:13.715]  Of course, he has a degree from Harvard in banking and finance.
[01:55:14.236 --> 01:55:15.356]  He's worked at the State Department.
[01:55:15.377 --> 01:55:16.057]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:55:16.237 --> 01:55:18.779]  He's been a consultant for certain agencies.
[01:55:19.559 --> 01:55:21.800]  And that's what he's doing.
[01:55:22.121 --> 01:55:24.122]  This is Pulitzer Prize winning stuff.
[01:55:25.738 --> 01:55:28.500]  But it's not sexy to the public, so nobody's promoting it.
[01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:32.924]  But it's scaring the hell out of the system that we've got these whistleblowers on.
[01:55:32.944 --> 01:55:38.408]  And that we can magnify what Cernovich is saying and what Paul's saying.
[01:55:38.428 --> 01:55:41.110]  I want to go back to James and Ron and Skits and Beto and Jessica.
[01:55:41.130 --> 01:55:42.371]  I promise I'm going to get to all of you.
[01:55:46.435 --> 01:55:49.037]  We've got so much to break down here, so much to go over.
[01:55:51.323 --> 01:56:01.469]  But I just want to encourage all the listeners and viewers to understand we have LiverShield that is a known concentrate of herbs and compounds that help open up the liver and get the toxins out that have been built up in it.
[01:56:01.949 --> 01:56:03.350]  Go find out about LiverShield yourself.
[01:56:03.370 --> 01:56:06.011]  You can take it with the Oxy Powder and do a gallbladder or liver cleanse.
[01:56:06.352 --> 01:56:07.212]  Consult your physician, though.
[01:56:07.232 --> 01:56:08.273]  This is really serious stuff.
[01:56:08.713 --> 01:56:09.373]  It's discounted.
[01:56:09.654 --> 01:56:10.694]  It's only $20 right now.
[01:56:10.714 --> 01:56:11.835]  33% off.
[01:56:12.295 --> 01:56:14.156]  Very concentrated in an oil form.
[01:56:14.436 --> 01:56:15.797]  Your purchase supports the broadcast.
[01:56:15.817 --> 01:56:15.857]  888-253-3139.
[01:56:19.239 --> 01:56:21.521]  And 53% off caveman ends today.
[01:56:21.561 --> 01:56:22.201]  It's got to end today.
[01:56:22.501 --> 01:56:24.122]  James, finishing up about aspartame.
[01:56:24.402 --> 01:56:30.326]  What is it like to hear your family warn of it decades ago and now see mainstream news admitting it gives you brain tumors?
[01:56:31.855 --> 01:56:32.776]  It's really amazing.
[01:56:32.916 --> 01:56:38.459]  It's an amazing thing to see, honestly, seeing how they were on top of this way before anyone else.
[01:56:38.679 --> 01:56:43.362]  Like, kids on the street would just call me crazy why they guzzled down a six-pack of Diet Coke.
[01:56:43.622 --> 01:56:48.624]  I've warned people thousands of times about Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi, if it's aspartame.
[01:56:48.805 --> 01:56:50.586]  They just laugh at me to the point I've quit.
[01:56:52.527 --> 01:56:55.468]  Yeah, it's really hard to try to convince people of these things.
[01:56:58.238 --> 01:57:05.501]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[01:57:05.521 --> 01:57:06.361]  Keep up the good work.
[01:57:06.421 --> 01:57:09.923]  Let's go ahead and go to Ron in the great state of Vermont.
[01:57:10.663 --> 01:57:11.343]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:57:11.383 --> 01:57:11.743]  Go ahead.
[01:57:12.944 --> 01:57:20.327]  You were colonized by the liberals, but I tell you, it's sure a beautiful state.
[01:57:20.367 --> 01:57:20.767]  I've been there.
[01:57:22.239 --> 01:57:23.040]  Yeah, yeah, it is.
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:24.982]  It's terrific.
[01:57:25.082 --> 01:57:28.765]  And Sanders, he's a pretty good guy, I gotta say.
[01:57:29.125 --> 01:57:33.570]  You know, we meet him on Church Street and, you know, he's kind of a regular guy.
[01:57:33.610 --> 01:57:34.811]  He's certainly not an elitist.
[01:57:34.831 --> 01:57:35.752]  He's certainly not an elitist.
[01:57:36.764 --> 01:57:37.024]  Right.
[01:57:37.264 --> 01:57:45.968]  What I wanted to say is two years ago, you asked your audience, what would it take for you to get involved?
[01:57:46.028 --> 01:57:56.792]  And for me, it was when they take away my choice of whether to vaccinate my children or my grandchildren, because I'm 60.
[01:57:57.912 --> 01:57:59.013]  That would be the time.
[01:57:59.593 --> 01:58:01.734]  And I voiced my opinion.
[01:58:03.842 --> 01:58:10.903]  RFK's son was here, you know, advocating, you know, to not mandate vaccines, but it didn't work.
[01:58:10.923 --> 01:58:13.524]  Isn't it great that Trump put him on that, to head up that commission?
[01:58:15.044 --> 01:58:26.786]  I hope so, because I believe that the healthcare will never, ever be fixed, because we are, you know, dysfunctionally, we are not healthy.
[01:58:27.006 --> 01:58:29.947]  That's why we spend the most time... Ron, you're a really articulate caller.
[01:58:29.987 --> 01:58:30.407]  Stay there.
[01:58:30.447 --> 01:58:32.007]  I'm going to these callers later.
[01:58:32.247 --> 01:58:33.288]  We're in this together.
[01:58:33.328 --> 01:58:33.588]  Thank you.
[01:58:33.608 --> 01:58:34.008]  Thank you.
[01:58:34.028 --> 01:58:34.449]  Don't thank me.
[01:58:53.983 --> 01:59:06.546]  Although conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of showing up to her already cancelled speech at Berkeley, that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans from conducting a large First Amendment rally in its place.
[01:59:06.786 --> 01:59:12.328]  Prominent social media icons such as Gavin McInnes, Lauren Southern, Based Stickman,
[01:59:12.648 --> 01:59:19.073]  Baked Alaska, Brittany Pettibone and Faith Goldie showed up to support free speech and gave speeches.
[01:59:19.334 --> 01:59:28.201]  Reports that the Berkeley police did their job in protecting the peace have come in, and apparently a total of six Antifa protesters were arrested.
[01:59:28.441 --> 01:59:33.946]  Two for resisting arrest, one for a drug violation, and another for possessing a weapon.
[01:59:34.286 --> 01:59:42.670]  Two more arrests were made earlier in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police.
[01:59:42.911 --> 01:59:48.754]  Despite these arrests, the protests remained peaceful and dialogue between both sides was present.
[01:59:48.974 --> 01:59:52.255]  This is Millie Weaver reporting to you for InfoWars.com.
[01:59:54.937 --> 02:00:00.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.713 --> 02:00:19.735]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[02:00:20.276 --> 02:00:22.997]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:23.017 --> 02:00:31.641]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Vermont, making some great points about his line in the sand.
[02:00:31.701 --> 02:00:33.902]  I've said that medical tyranny is my line in the sand.
[02:00:33.922 --> 02:00:34.862]  I'm not a violent person.
[02:00:34.882 --> 02:00:36.443]  I'm not looking for trouble.
[02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:39.903]  But I know they're putting steroids in vaccines.
[02:00:39.963 --> 02:00:43.347]  I know they've been giving vaccine liability protection starting in the 80s.
[02:00:44.408 --> 02:00:48.793]  I know we've gone from 1 in 30-something thousand with autism 30 years ago, 35 years ago, to 1 in 56 now.
[02:00:53.098 --> 02:00:55.319]  The only place that gives more vaccines than us is South Korea.
[02:00:55.339 --> 02:00:56.599]  They're like 1 in 24.
[02:00:57.339 --> 02:00:58.620]  The brain damage is everywhere.
[02:00:58.680 --> 02:00:59.820]  The autoimmune results.
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:00.640]  They know.
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:04.701]  When they give preemies vaccines, they get them ready to put them on ventilation.
[02:01:04.721 --> 02:01:06.862]  When they die, they have to bring them back to life.
[02:01:06.902 --> 02:01:07.782]  I've had nurses on.
[02:01:08.142 --> 02:01:08.743]  They know.
[02:01:09.183 --> 02:01:13.044]  And California's passed laws to start forced inoculations and stuff.
[02:01:13.484 --> 02:01:15.304]  I mean, they're getting rid of the exemptions.
[02:01:15.365 --> 02:01:16.765]  It's very, very frightening.
[02:01:17.145 --> 02:01:18.245]  We've got to work harder.
[02:01:18.565 --> 02:01:19.966]  And by the way, I don't want to hear it from people
[02:01:20.566 --> 02:01:25.427]  Like Dr. Dina Dell used to say on radio, arrest somebody if they haven't taken a vaccine, because you're endangering others.
[02:01:26.727 --> 02:01:38.190]  Brother, if you've taken your vaccine for anthrax or whatever, that doesn't protect you by the way, and all these other crap vaccines that are dangerous, and their own inserts say can kill you, then you're supposedly protected!
[02:01:38.490 --> 02:01:39.751]  Don't give me that bull!
[02:01:40.311 --> 02:01:42.711]  That, that, that, that, that, I don't have my own body!
[02:01:43.211 --> 02:01:44.092]  I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[02:01:44.152 --> 02:01:44.732]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:01:46.672 --> 02:01:49.453]  Alex, you know, it's, uh, it's just like, um,
[02:01:49.966 --> 02:01:57.849]  When you're in an airplane, you know, you can't help the person next to you until you put the mask on yourself.
[02:01:58.429 --> 02:02:02.751]  So I need to be healthy before, you know, I can help others.
[02:02:03.011 --> 02:02:09.054]  And the globalists know that, you know, better than killing people is to maim people.
[02:02:09.554 --> 02:02:12.175]  Because when you maim one person,
[02:02:12.748 --> 02:02:15.231]  You're really taking down the whole family.
[02:02:15.251 --> 02:02:18.795]  And it's really disgusting and I hate it.
[02:02:19.155 --> 02:02:22.519]  And that's why I love your nutraceuticals.
[02:02:23.163 --> 02:02:27.664]  Because this is at the crux of how we can win.
[02:02:28.125 --> 02:02:36.847]  If we get healthier, our minds will be clear and we will be able to attack the problems.
[02:02:38.228 --> 02:02:43.830]  I went to a doctor who was the head pathologist at Columbia Presbyterian.
[02:02:44.350 --> 02:02:48.011]  He left Western Medicine because he just
[02:02:48.610 --> 02:02:58.353]  You know, what he was finding was, you know, the diseases were not caused by what Western medicine was trying to feed us.
[02:02:58.453 --> 02:03:02.715]  Well, they admit most of it is deficiencies, and I've had medical doctors on about that.
[02:03:03.015 --> 02:03:04.295]  If you don't have vitamin C, you die.
[02:03:04.315 --> 02:03:06.136]  If you don't have good iodine, you die.
[02:03:06.156 --> 02:03:07.257]  If you don't have oxygen, you die.
[02:03:07.277 --> 02:03:08.377]  If you don't have water, you die.
[02:03:08.797 --> 02:03:10.198]  If you don't have iron, you die.
[02:03:10.598 --> 02:03:23.827]  These are facts, and it's admitted that scurvy is rampant across the Western world because of malabsorption in the gut, because of people's bad diets, and they just don't know that something like leafy vegetables would make their lives so much better.
[02:03:25.354 --> 02:03:39.839]  Before I get dropped here, the most important thing is that the healthcare people, this new bill coming up, I want to see nutraceuticals paid for by insurance companies.
[02:03:40.339 --> 02:03:42.420]  It is absolutely huge.
[02:03:42.580 --> 02:03:48.343]  It is the biggest thing that we could do because that will drive down the cost.
[02:03:48.383 --> 02:03:50.044]  We don't need these drugs.
[02:03:51.105 --> 02:03:56.928]  My doctor, you know, he has 50 recliner chairs.
[02:03:57.128 --> 02:03:58.969]  He feeds ozone
[02:03:59.651 --> 02:04:00.432]  We're good to go.
[02:04:15.248 --> 02:04:17.329]  We need to go back to the apothecary.
[02:04:17.369 --> 02:04:23.152]  That was just ground herbs and oils and essential cofactors that the ancients had developed.
[02:04:23.252 --> 02:04:33.557]  Every culture had them, whether it was the apothecaries of the Middle East, or whether it was the apothecaries of the Armenians, or whether it was the apothecaries of Western Europe, or the apothecaries of China.
[02:04:33.878 --> 02:04:38.520]  You go look at the ancient formulas, they're similar because they found out what really worked.
[02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:43.462]  And you can always find some stuff that was superstitious or whatever, but most of it was based in reality.
[02:04:43.742 --> 02:04:50.926]  That's a whole other area of medicine that's just been walled off and lost, and it should be covered by your insurance.
[02:04:50.946 --> 02:04:52.827]  A show should be having a nutritionist.
[02:04:53.728 --> 02:04:55.749]  So the caller is absolutely right.
[02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:57.070]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:57.110 --> 02:04:57.570]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.408 --> 02:05:08.652]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse, minor words, and his was action.
[02:05:09.252 --> 02:05:10.773]  His was what he's done to women.
[02:05:10.813 --> 02:05:16.497]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[02:05:16.717 --> 02:05:19.019]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[02:05:19.379 --> 02:05:25.564]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously, four of them here tonight.
[02:05:25.704 --> 02:05:31.008]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:44.582]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[02:05:45.423 --> 02:05:46.884]  It's a fight for our minds.
[02:05:47.544 --> 02:05:49.486]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[02:05:49.806 --> 02:05:54.009]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:05:54.149 --> 02:05:57.512]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[02:05:57.592 --> 02:05:59.113]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:05.281]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:06:05.321 --> 02:06:06.402]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:06:06.642 --> 02:06:07.583]  Why is this so good?
[02:06:07.863 --> 02:06:13.108]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:06:13.188 --> 02:06:26.741]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:06:26.801 --> 02:06:28.182]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:06:28.943 --> 02:06:30.544]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:06:30.604 --> 02:06:33.086]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:06:33.186 --> 02:06:34.447]  These are all parasites.
[02:06:34.487 --> 02:06:35.587]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:06:35.607 --> 02:06:36.648]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:06:36.948 --> 02:06:41.271]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:06:41.491 --> 02:06:44.653]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:06:44.773 --> 02:06:47.815]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:06:47.835 --> 02:06:48.855]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:06:48.895 --> 02:06:50.776]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:50.836 --> 02:06:51.857]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:06:51.877 --> 02:06:53.958]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:06:54.579 --> 02:06:57.620]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:57.880 --> 02:06:59.762]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:07:00.142 --> 02:07:02.103]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:07:03.539 --> 02:07:16.103]  Although conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of showing up to her already-canceled speech at Berkeley, that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans from conducting a large First Amendment rally in its place.
[02:07:16.343 --> 02:07:24.465]  Prominent social media icons such as Gavin McInnes, Lauren Southern, Based Stickman, Baked Alaska, Brittany Pennybone, and Faith
[02:07:24.625 --> 02:07:28.629]  Goldie showed up to support free speech and gave speeches.
[02:07:28.869 --> 02:07:37.737]  Reports that the Berkeley police did their job in protecting the peace have come in, and apparently a total of six Antifa protesters were arrested.
[02:07:37.998 --> 02:07:43.483]  Two for resisting arrest, one for a drug violation, and another for possessing a weapon.
[02:07:43.823 --> 02:07:52.212]  Two more arrests were made earlier in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police.
[02:07:52.472 --> 02:07:58.298]  Despite these arrests, the protests remained peaceful and dialogue between both sides was present.
[02:07:58.538 --> 02:08:01.662]  This is Millie Weaver reporting to you for InfoWars.com.
[02:08:06.397 --> 02:08:08.560]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:14.206]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:29.241 --> 02:08:31.442]  It's up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:08:31.462 --> 02:08:33.482]  We can just punch it up and put it on screen for TV viewers.
[02:08:34.963 --> 02:08:37.524]  It's at these different May Day parades here in the United States.
[02:08:37.544 --> 02:08:47.227]  The communists are setting fires, attacking people, beating people up, and wearing shirts that show ISIS cutting Donald Trump's head off.
[02:08:48.168 --> 02:08:52.789]  Violent commie agitators set fire to police over in Europe.
[02:08:53.389 --> 02:08:57.711]  They're having more and more fires, more parts of the cities burned down, mainly Muslims doing it.
[02:08:58.598 --> 02:09:00.558]  The Islamification is going nicely.
[02:09:01.899 --> 02:09:12.860]  And Paul Watson's written another article for InfoWars.com where you can see the t-shirt, we'll put it up on screen for you, where it shows ISIS cutting Trump's head off and it's not a Muslim.
[02:09:13.221 --> 02:09:14.101]  Doesn't look like a Muslim.
[02:09:14.361 --> 02:09:16.641]  It's like we have women wearing hijabs.
[02:09:17.701 --> 02:09:27.023]  We have women wearing hijabs and saying it's part of working with Islam and demystifying it.
[02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:31.914]  So again, those stories are up on Infowars.com.
[02:09:32.054 --> 02:09:36.538]  Leftist t-shirt, a May Day rally shows ISIS beheading Donald Trump.
[02:09:36.558 --> 02:09:43.865]  And I told you that I went out to rallies in the last two years and saw people with ISIS flags, ISIS signs.
[02:09:43.905 --> 02:09:45.126]  It's like avant-garde.
[02:09:45.166 --> 02:09:45.887]  It's cutting edge.
[02:09:45.927 --> 02:09:46.407]  It's trendy.
[02:09:46.427 --> 02:09:46.768]  It's cool.
[02:09:48.052 --> 02:09:56.054]  Just like we've seen North Korea kill millions of its own people through starvation, Venezuela totally collapsing, Cuba a nightmare, Communist China a nightmare for the people.
[02:09:56.914 --> 02:10:09.557]  But at the universities there's the Mao groups and the Red Guard and it's really fashionable in Colorado and in New York and places they have restaurants about Mao and about linen and the kids get tattoos of it.
[02:10:09.577 --> 02:10:15.639]  It's really sexy to talk about the Red Terror and all the death and all the destruction and all the evil.
[02:10:16.559 --> 02:10:24.688]  But they want to live here, driving their nice cars that mommy and daddy got them, and using their expensive smartphones that capitalism gave them.
[02:10:24.968 --> 02:10:28.372]  So May Day is the Communist Workers' Day.
[02:10:28.392 --> 02:10:32.837]  It's also an ancient occult day, the left-hand path of the Jacobins.
[02:10:33.317 --> 02:10:39.002]  So we have May Day because of the French revolution, not a revolution, but a violent, hateful revolution.
[02:10:39.283 --> 02:10:49.172]  They wanted to overthrow God, country, not just royalty, and create a nine-day work week with no holidays and a ruling class of absolute god-kings over the people.
[02:10:49.833 --> 02:10:51.995]  And communism came out of the Jacobins.
[02:10:52.035 --> 02:10:52.855]  That's admitted history.
[02:10:53.556 --> 02:10:55.178]  But the average person doesn't know.
[02:10:56.445 --> 02:11:01.107]  They want disorder, they want death, they want destruction, but only to bring them to absolute power.
[02:11:01.627 --> 02:11:06.408]  They want regime change for destabilization and total control.
[02:11:07.129 --> 02:11:09.850]  They want a red terror, a season of the abyss.
[02:11:10.830 --> 02:11:11.590]  And that's what they get.
[02:11:12.070 --> 02:11:17.972]  Paris chaos as rioters erupt on streets against election candidate Marie Le Pen, who's now in the lead in many polls.
[02:11:18.373 --> 02:11:21.053]  The latest 100 arrests after a clash with police in Germany.
[02:11:21.334 --> 02:11:25.235]  Protesters decrying Texas sanctuary city's bill staged sit-in.
[02:11:26.605 --> 02:11:27.337]  Isn't that cute?
[02:11:28.848 --> 02:11:32.629]  But you notice, oh, Cuba's having its first mayday with the new Castro.
[02:11:32.969 --> 02:11:34.889]  Oh, it's hereditary power like North Korea.
[02:11:35.409 --> 02:11:40.591]  Joining us, and then I promise I'm going to go to your calls before I go to Roger Stone with Breaking News.
[02:11:40.651 --> 02:11:43.351]  I will get to Skits and Beto and Jessica.
[02:11:43.711 --> 02:11:44.591]  Just stay there.
[02:11:44.611 --> 02:11:46.232]  I'm going to get to all of you and Dean and Isaac.
[02:11:46.532 --> 02:11:49.192]  I want to hear what Jessica has to say on cops supporting Trump.
[02:11:49.832 --> 02:11:52.013]  I want to hear what Beto has to say on Trump's first 100 days.
[02:11:52.073 --> 02:11:53.153]  Skits wants to talk about Trump.
[02:11:53.733 --> 02:11:55.714]  Isaac wants to talk about Trump and Jared and Ivanka.
[02:11:56.014 --> 02:11:56.614]  Speaking of that,
[02:11:58.194 --> 02:12:00.395]  Months ago he wrote about it at StevePchenik.com.
[02:12:00.795 --> 02:12:03.475]  Three weeks ago or so he came out and said, watch, it's going to come out.
[02:12:03.775 --> 02:12:05.476]  He's been compromised by Communist China.
[02:12:06.016 --> 02:12:11.737]  And sure enough, it was in the New York Times last Friday that Jared Kushner's tied into that.
[02:12:11.777 --> 02:12:13.818]  Now he's got some breaking factoids.
[02:12:14.218 --> 02:12:19.499]  Former State Department head of psychological operations, worked with other agencies, was involved in regime change, you name it.
[02:12:20.439 --> 02:12:23.480]  The Camp David Accord successfully has a great pedigree.
[02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:25.380]  He co-wrote books with, of course, Tom Clancy.
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:28.801]  He's also a medical doctor, psychiatrist, and military veteran.
[02:12:29.482 --> 02:12:30.662]  And that's Dr. Steve Pchenik.
[02:12:31.262 --> 02:12:32.882]  I just invited him on the show to see what's going on.
[02:12:32.902 --> 02:12:41.825]  I don't know the topics he's got, but I tell you, watching a bunch of spoiled brats celebrate collectivism and communism all over the world today
[02:12:42.305 --> 02:12:50.792]  As they're trying to run from North Korea into China, because it's quasi-free market, they're trying to run from Cuba here, they're running from Venezuela to get out of there.
[02:12:51.132 --> 02:12:54.435]  I mean, where is this utopia on May Day, Dr. Pachinik?
[02:12:54.475 --> 02:13:01.720]  I know your family, your dad was in the French Army, World War II, got driven out, some died in the Holocaust, then you went to Cuba, then you came here.
[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:08.846]  You're uniquely, I think, vetted with the pedigree to speak about the wonders of communism on May Day.
[02:13:09.878 --> 02:13:13.142]  Well, as you know, there are no wonders of communism.
[02:13:13.983 --> 02:13:19.729]  My former assignment under Nixon and then under Reagan and Bush was to
[02:13:20.692 --> 02:13:23.933]  Create the architecture for the takedown of the Soviet Union.
[02:13:24.133 --> 02:13:30.296]  I did that at the Rand Corporation, came back into the Reagan administration under Baker and then under Bush.
[02:13:30.996 --> 02:13:34.238]  And we were successful in taking it down without any soldiers.
[02:13:34.758 --> 02:13:36.058]  The reason is very simple.
[02:13:36.139 --> 02:13:40.160]  It's not that I'm all that great or we were great in regime change.
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:43.722]  It was that Soviet Union and communism just didn't work.
[02:13:44.842 --> 02:13:46.825]  And it was rotten from the inside.
[02:13:47.025 --> 02:13:51.530]  I had men who were walking in the streets at literally 7 in the morning, totally drunk.
[02:13:52.190 --> 02:13:52.931]  No jobs.
[02:13:53.051 --> 02:13:56.455]  They had factories which were making things that were not useful.
[02:13:56.915 --> 02:13:58.838]  The army was not very effective.
[02:13:58.878 --> 02:14:01.160]  The intelligence service could be bought off.
[02:14:01.621 --> 02:14:02.882]  So forth and so on.
[02:14:03.002 --> 02:14:05.385]  So communism, the notion of the left
[02:14:06.005 --> 02:14:11.106]  And the ideology of the left is all fine and good, but in reality, it has no credibility.
[02:14:11.586 --> 02:14:13.006]  It has no viability.
[02:14:13.146 --> 02:14:14.927]  It has no legs to stand on.
[02:14:15.487 --> 02:14:18.907]  So, when you're young, you want to protest and rebel.
[02:14:19.408 --> 02:14:25.869]  The Jacobean Revolution was under Reims-Pierre, did effectively bring in Napoleon.
[02:14:27.469 --> 02:14:31.610]  The Russian Revolution effectively brought in Stalin.
[02:14:32.370 --> 02:14:39.993]  Now, what I'm about to say is going to be a little disconcerting to you and your listeners, but it's very important for me to say this right now.
[02:14:41.174 --> 02:14:52.658]  The revolution you had started, Alex, nothing to do with communism, had to do with the voice of America and shifting us to the alternative right, or whatever narrative we want to use.
[02:14:53.059 --> 02:14:53.499]  New right.
[02:14:54.474 --> 02:14:55.015]  New right.
[02:14:55.475 --> 02:15:00.019]  The point I'm trying to make, and I wrote this several weeks ago, was the following.
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:07.506]  When Alex Jones gets compromised, for whatever reason, I'm sorry he had to go to court.
[02:15:08.227 --> 02:15:09.348]  I saw that issue.
[02:15:09.548 --> 02:15:14.173]  Then I saw that Fox News was in trouble and Riley was compromised.
[02:15:14.233 --> 02:15:16.515]  Then I saw that Bannon was compromised.
[02:15:16.595 --> 02:15:18.577]  Now I see that Gork is compromised.
[02:15:19.137 --> 02:15:27.161]  So basically what we have now, Alex, is a counter-revolution or basically what's happening in any revolution.
[02:15:27.781 --> 02:15:34.664]  It's what Hitler did in the Night of the Long Knives when he took care of his SA people and he exterminated them.
[02:15:35.325 --> 02:15:35.745]  That's right.
[02:15:35.825 --> 02:15:39.166]  First they politically shut down your voice before they physically shut you down.
[02:15:39.186 --> 02:15:44.429]  And when you use the word compromised, I'm not backing down or giving up under this organized assault.
[02:15:45.253 --> 02:15:49.816]  That's why I state this to the audience and I say it to you.
[02:15:49.836 --> 02:15:53.198]  I wrote that and I still mean that you are the American icon.
[02:15:53.319 --> 02:15:53.839]  However...
[02:15:54.485 --> 02:16:05.009]  The orders came out, there's no question in my mind now, it came out of the White House because the Clintons could never do this, the left doesn't have that kind of intelligence, they don't have that kind of capability.
[02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:19.494]  But within the structure of McMaster, the National Security Council, and the fact that we're mobilizing both into North Korea, into Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, it became obvious to me that whatever order
[02:16:19.534 --> 02:16:20.354]  No, I've got it.
[02:16:20.394 --> 02:16:28.497]  Trump doesn't want, or his people don't want the weapons lying around that brought him to power, just like that normally happens in a revolution.
[02:16:28.997 --> 02:16:31.918]  Whoever helps you get in, you end up destroying.
[02:16:32.118 --> 02:16:33.639]  I don't think Trump's doing that himself.
[02:16:44.602 --> 02:16:53.888]  But it's very, very clear that this is being directed because, look, Trump didn't get rid of that office that Obama set up that was designed to go after the new right.
[02:16:54.369 --> 02:16:56.350]  And so basically it's just been taken on.
[02:16:57.010 --> 02:17:00.653]  And now we see this gutting taking place or this attempt to gutting.
[02:17:00.673 --> 02:17:02.794]  What I'm getting at is it's exactly right.
[02:17:02.894 --> 02:17:03.875]  Alex, you know this.
[02:17:04.155 --> 02:17:08.338]  I know this is the history of all revolutions, whether it's the left or the right.
[02:17:08.878 --> 02:17:14.182]  Immediately, those we bring to power, whether they're generals or civilians in the senior ranks,
[02:17:14.662 --> 02:17:17.984]  They have never been in the forefront of any revolution.
[02:17:18.264 --> 02:17:23.968]  Our generals, who are three, four stars or whatever, they sit back, they use the system.
[02:17:24.448 --> 02:17:30.672]  Then when they get in the position of power, they try to eliminate any of the voices of agitation propaganda.
[02:17:31.033 --> 02:17:38.277]  That comes out from you, that would have come out from Bannon, that would have come out from Gorka, that would have come out from any other people.
[02:17:38.738 --> 02:17:43.901]  From my point of view, this was part of the system and I was waiting for it to happen.
[02:17:44.181 --> 02:17:45.623]  That's right, and let's be clear historically.
[02:17:46.084 --> 02:17:51.191]  It's because they don't want people who effectively led peaceful revolution still around.
[02:17:52.233 --> 02:17:55.157]  In case they go sideways, they know we can remove them.
[02:17:55.517 --> 02:17:57.039]  So what do you think I should do about this?
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:02.701]  Well, number one, the reason I'm coming on the show, one, is to show my support to you.
[02:18:02.801 --> 02:18:05.882]  As I said, you're both a friend and you're an American icon.
[02:18:05.962 --> 02:18:18.486]  Number two, I think you should consistently maintain the dialogue that we, we, not, not Bannon, not Breitbart, not the Mercers, no one else, no other generals.
[02:18:18.526 --> 02:18:22.367]  There isn't one general who has the guts to come forth in a revolution.
[02:18:22.387 --> 02:18:23.528]  They're just not that way.
[02:18:23.548 --> 02:18:24.488]  They're socialized.
[02:18:24.912 --> 02:18:30.174]  To be within their own system, almost a socialization system, or socialism.
[02:18:30.254 --> 02:18:33.535]  They're specialized in their own little paradigm to control them.
[02:18:33.555 --> 02:18:33.855]  Correct.
[02:18:34.115 --> 02:18:47.459]  And the paradigm is a dangerous one because it demands a lot of money from us, the taxpayers, and at the same time it's the expansion of, once again, Halliburton, KBR, they're all over Djibouti, they're all over Africa.
[02:18:47.819 --> 02:18:55.406]  So basically, they're in their own ivory tower, forbidden city, delusional, and they are scared of the power that brought them to power.
[02:18:55.426 --> 02:18:55.706]  Correct.
[02:18:56.127 --> 02:19:01.471]  I know for a fact that Trump wanted to continue to work with us, but the elites told him, no, you can't do that.
[02:19:01.531 --> 02:19:03.473]  Well, when's it going to end?
[02:19:03.513 --> 02:19:07.417]  They're always going to demand more, more, more from him, but they never compromise.
[02:19:08.077 --> 02:19:09.899]  Well, that's correct, Alex.
[02:19:10.099 --> 02:19:13.282]  It has to now depend on the character of Trump.
[02:19:14.039 --> 02:19:42.950]  If in fact he's a man of his word, a man of his conviction, not mercurial, not suddenly waving around and bringing in the people he does not know, or bringing in Jared Kushner with the Steinmetz family and the Israelis and the Goldman Sachs boys, none of whom have been tutored in anything to do with national security, foreign policy, but we're structured now to be in a position of several wars at the same time.
[02:19:43.710 --> 02:20:00.996]  North Korea has been in a position where for the past 20 to 30 years our military has developed what's called the 5027 plan or 5029 plan where the Army, Navy, Marines, Special Forces can preempt an attack on North Korea.
[02:20:01.477 --> 02:20:04.898]  In Afghanistan, we have Marines going back in
[02:20:05.698 --> 02:20:10.181]  After our Marines were killed in exactly the same place, we have a 15-year war.
[02:20:10.701 --> 02:20:18.745]  We have Marines that were stationed Special Forces in Syria with artillery and with howitzers and soldiers.
[02:20:19.426 --> 02:20:26.550]  In effect, what we have is a military out of control once again, which has never performed effectively.
[02:20:26.830 --> 02:20:27.150]  Never!
[02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:31.632]  Not since the Korean War, not since the Vietnam... Sir, but let me just stop you there.
[02:20:31.652 --> 02:20:32.613]  Let's look at the waterfront.
[02:20:32.733 --> 02:20:33.854]  I even told my lawyer
[02:20:34.434 --> 02:20:47.206]  Three weeks ago, I said, I've looked at this attack and I said, I guarantee you, the people in the Trump administration that are forming this deep state coup to capture the president, which they've almost completed at many levels, they see us as a threat.
[02:20:47.246 --> 02:20:50.869]  And I said, this is being directed by people inside the White House.
[02:20:51.250 --> 02:20:54.212]  I said, these attacks are too concerted, too coordinated.
[02:20:55.182 --> 02:21:04.145]  But I said, I know it's not Trump doing it, because he's the very same people sabotaging him, backbiting him, like Genrich did, saying he's not going to drain the swamp.
[02:21:04.425 --> 02:21:18.649]  Trump's bringing jobs back, he's exposing globalism, he's doing a lot of good things like killing TPP, but clearly he's got people culling the patriots out, organizing to go after the Freedom Caucus, but here's the good news.
[02:21:19.961 --> 02:21:31.002]  Their attacks on us, the Democrats, the Soros groups, Soros' very law firm that he founded in New York's the one suing me with the yogurt maker and the Islamicist, if you expand on that...
[02:21:32.168 --> 02:21:34.230]  And you look at all the groups that are coming after us.
[02:21:34.691 --> 02:21:37.274]  It's all completely and absolutely coordinated.
[02:21:37.294 --> 02:21:38.255]  But here's the good news.
[02:21:38.935 --> 02:21:39.916]  Our listeners see it.
[02:21:40.017 --> 02:21:42.099]  They're only intensifying our support.
[02:21:42.359 --> 02:21:43.881]  We're only getting more affiliates.
[02:21:44.201 --> 02:21:46.924]  We're only, in the face of this, becoming more successful.
[02:21:47.244 --> 02:21:50.208]  It's backfired, just like media attacks only help Trump.
[02:21:50.268 --> 02:21:51.289]  So then I'm not stupid.
[02:21:51.709 --> 02:21:52.831]  I realize, oh my God.
[02:21:53.311 --> 02:22:02.182]  They're only assassinating my character because they probably, I think, are beginning to move into the zone where they might trump something up, pun intended, or actually kill me.
[02:22:02.222 --> 02:22:02.723]  What do you think?
[02:22:03.533 --> 02:22:04.474]  They're not going to kill you.
[02:22:04.514 --> 02:22:05.955]  There's no reason to kill you.
[02:22:06.015 --> 02:22:08.756]  They tried a verbal assassination.
[02:22:08.877 --> 02:22:09.477]  It didn't work.
[02:22:09.737 --> 02:22:18.283]  I mean, with all these nonsensical comedians, whether Colbert or Samantha Bee or whatever it was, no one listens to that anymore.
[02:22:18.523 --> 02:22:19.444]  It's antiquated.
[02:22:19.524 --> 02:22:21.625]  They're basically on their own sinking ship.
[02:22:21.725 --> 02:22:25.728]  Most people don't, but some weak-minded people that have been around actually do.
[02:22:27.250 --> 02:22:30.091]  Well, the point is this, it's not about a few.
[02:22:30.471 --> 02:22:44.293]  The mainstream that we've created and that you've created and that part of our intelligence and military was part of and then suddenly they turned around to try to desiccate or try to eviscerate us, that's not going to work.
[02:22:44.853 --> 02:22:53.835]  Because contrary to the understanding of the American people, this is not the old times with Smedley, this is not the old times with
[02:22:54.415 --> 02:22:56.357]  Anybody else who brought them to power.
[02:22:56.417 --> 02:23:03.885]  This is a new time when the internet and people like ourselves can create a lot of problems for our own establishment.
[02:23:04.301 --> 02:23:08.783]  Now once again, the military-industrial complex is far more important than Chobani.
[02:23:09.204 --> 02:23:12.125]  You know, the Turkish man who wants to sue you for yogurt?
[02:23:12.265 --> 02:23:12.865]  Let him do that.
[02:23:12.885 --> 02:23:14.266]  It's a waste of time and money.
[02:23:14.826 --> 02:23:18.628]  Your character is strong enough and you're smart enough and you're witty enough.
[02:23:19.069 --> 02:23:22.590]  Almost reminds me of this guy Bill Hicks, but of course you're not he.
[02:23:23.111 --> 02:23:27.273]  So your brilliance is so sharp that it's a knife in itself.
[02:23:27.433 --> 02:23:29.214]  You continue to be what you are.
[02:23:29.634 --> 02:23:40.638]  But I want to tell you that there was no question in my mind that this was a concerted effort by the White House to tame down or eviscerate the very people who were brought to power.
[02:23:41.238 --> 02:23:43.139]  Sure, well just to be nice, I'm not that smart.
[02:23:43.419 --> 02:23:46.440]  I'm following the blueprint of Americana, but let's pull back from this.
[02:23:46.980 --> 02:23:48.621]  What do you expect him to do next?
[02:23:49.841 --> 02:23:51.141]  What do you see the next move being?
[02:23:53.120 --> 02:24:07.388]  Well, what they're going to do next is try to expose any vulnerabilities that you may have again, or I may have, or any one of a number of people who are not following the trend or are not succumbing to the military-industrial complex.
[02:24:07.868 --> 02:24:17.434]  You're talking about KBR in Djibouti having an incredible presence when we have no national security interests in Sudan, Somalia, or any of the African
[02:24:17.614 --> 02:24:26.880]  And by the way, I've had a lot of special forces people that just got back tell me, in fact some senior ones, the exact same thing, that it's a disaster, that we're wrecking it, that we're looting it, and so they're very upset.
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:28.642]  But separately, let me just give people some good news.
[02:24:29.762 --> 02:24:33.545]  I don't want to give sources out, obviously, but let's just say this.
[02:24:35.026 --> 02:24:43.432]  I know Mike Cernovich's sources, the government knows his sources, so it's not a secret to them, but it's obviously who's been retweeting him and saying he's a great guy and retweeting our stuff.
[02:24:43.892 --> 02:24:46.554]  There are people very close to the President who are for real.
[02:24:47.981 --> 02:24:48.761]  Hell, it's not a secret.
[02:24:48.802 --> 02:24:51.663]  It's his sons, especially Donald Jr., is a total patriot.
[02:24:51.903 --> 02:24:53.044]  And there's a bunch of other people.
[02:24:53.084 --> 02:24:56.946]  So Trump is for real, but he's being pulled by every side.
[02:24:57.347 --> 02:25:03.530]  And there are folks inside the White House threatening nuclear option to release information if they continue this.
[02:25:03.751 --> 02:25:06.532]  But there is an attempt to have a soft coup against the president.
[02:25:06.572 --> 02:25:07.413]  What do we do about that?
[02:25:08.243 --> 02:25:18.868]  Well, if we go back once again, this revolution was started with a coup and then a counter-coup and right now they have a soft coup where they've taken over and now I think Eric Jr.
[02:25:18.928 --> 02:25:20.488]  has to come into the forefront.
[02:25:20.869 --> 02:25:23.750]  I've repeatedly said that Jared has to leave.
[02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:28.192]  There's no question he's involved in corruption with the Chinese.
[02:25:28.212 --> 02:25:31.733]  There's no question he's involved in corruption with the Israeli family.
[02:25:32.033 --> 02:25:37.495]  The Steinmetz who were already indicted for diamond smuggling and illegal activities.
[02:25:37.515 --> 02:25:40.376]  I'm saying this to the Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
[02:25:40.777 --> 02:25:47.279]  He knows very well that this family, the Kushner family and the Steinmetzes are totally corrupt.
[02:25:47.339 --> 02:25:49.100]  We cannot have that in the White House.
[02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:52.343]  This is not a nepotism republic.
[02:25:52.383 --> 02:25:59.310]  This is a republic that fought its way by people like you, me, and others who went to war.
[02:25:59.490 --> 02:26:01.011]  Kushner never went to war.
[02:26:01.332 --> 02:26:03.574]  The Israelis never went to war with us.
[02:26:03.914 --> 02:26:05.175]  Mossad was 9-11.
[02:26:05.496 --> 02:26:08.378]  The Israelis were involved in 9-11.
[02:26:08.398 --> 02:26:10.360]  We have the neocons coming back.
[02:26:10.581 --> 02:26:13.704]  I am warning the administration again and again
[02:26:14.404 --> 02:26:28.697]  I did not take the time and the effort and the liberty and the risk that others are willing to do to bring back the pathetic neocons like Elliot Abrams or John Bolton or any one of these morons that you're putting in there.
[02:26:29.037 --> 02:26:36.704]  If McMaster doesn't understand how he came to power, he came to power because Tom Clancy and I gave him money in Armcath.
[02:26:37.025 --> 02:26:40.448]  He came to power because he sat on the boards of other companies.
[02:26:41.304 --> 02:26:45.925]  Mr. Mattis was on the board of Dynacorp.
[02:26:46.305 --> 02:26:47.926]  He was on the board of another company.
[02:26:48.046 --> 02:26:52.447]  If the generals really think they are that great, they better look into the mirror.
[02:26:52.747 --> 02:26:54.128]  They have never won a war.
[02:26:54.308 --> 02:27:00.749]  They have never taken down a regime, and they have failed repeatedly in executing any military action.
[02:27:00.829 --> 02:27:05.331]  This has been our history before Korea, before Vietnam.
[02:27:05.771 --> 02:27:09.812]  We lost 55,000 men because the generals were incompetent.
[02:27:10.367 --> 02:27:12.969]  Ignorant and they had a dereliction of duty.
[02:27:13.229 --> 02:27:14.651]  I go back to McMaster.
[02:27:15.091 --> 02:27:16.832]  This is a dereliction of duty.
[02:27:17.053 --> 02:27:31.485]  Anything he wants to do now and a force structure, bringing out the soldiers into North Korea and thinking that you can preempt an attack on North Korea when they're 30 miles away from Seoul, is both idiotic and inept.
[02:27:32.105 --> 02:27:36.469]  At the same time, continuing a war for 15 years in Afghanistan,
[02:27:36.869 --> 02:27:44.712]  Where thousands of our Marines were killed in Helmand Province and then putting more Marines in is nothing more than a barbaric stupidity.
[02:27:45.093 --> 02:27:57.038]  At the same time, putting in artillery and howitzers into Syria when you have no idea who the Alawites are, you have no idea how many Christians that the Bashar family is protecting, millions of them.
[02:27:57.418 --> 02:28:09.707]  And you're going to do a regime change because you have some moron named Pompeo, who's head of the CIA because he was number one at West Point but had never been in intelligence, never been overseas, really never understood anything.
[02:28:10.127 --> 02:28:11.168]  Doc, we're almost out of time.
[02:28:11.188 --> 02:28:12.389]  You've got to come back in the next few days.
[02:28:12.409 --> 02:28:13.350]  It really flushed us out.
[02:28:13.390 --> 02:28:16.592]  I promised you I'd go to calls and we'd have a Roger Stone with some breaking news.
[02:28:16.612 --> 02:28:17.773]  But this is the minute or two we have left.
[02:28:18.193 --> 02:28:21.115]  I love what Trump's doing transferring power from the globalist back.
[02:28:21.135 --> 02:28:22.597]  He's doing a lot of great things in the economy.
[02:28:23.297 --> 02:28:24.678]  TPP, we've talked about it.
[02:28:25.178 --> 02:28:25.979]  So many good things.
[02:28:26.019 --> 02:28:26.999]  So I think he's for real.
[02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:27.860]  We know he's for real.
[02:28:28.140 --> 02:28:29.401]  There is an internal struggle.
[02:28:30.422 --> 02:28:46.953]  The listeners need to go out to these rallies, to send letters to the President, to call into C-SPAN, to call into talk radio, to create the buzz that we didn't elect Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, and that we want the President to do something about the war on the press, the war on the liberty movement that is taking place.
[02:28:46.993 --> 02:28:50.075]  But more importantly, our listeners need to support your work.
[02:28:51.184 --> 02:28:58.993]  My work and others work as an act of resistance financially in the face of the attacks, the lawsuits, the kicking us off Google ads, you name it.
[02:28:59.233 --> 02:29:01.476]  Because again, the attacks are intensifying.
[02:29:01.796 --> 02:29:02.797]  We're a beta test.
[02:29:03.078 --> 02:29:05.741]  And if they're able to shut down InfoWars, the sky's the limit.
[02:29:06.755 --> 02:29:07.276]  That's correct.
[02:29:07.496 --> 02:29:09.698]  I do agree with you, and they won't shut you down.
[02:29:09.819 --> 02:29:10.940]  They're not that stupid.
[02:29:11.020 --> 02:29:13.503]  If they're that stupid, then they're self-destructive.
[02:29:14.063 --> 02:29:16.907]  But if that happens, we will do an alternative channel.
[02:29:17.027 --> 02:29:17.788]  Don't worry, Alex.
[02:29:17.828 --> 02:29:20.831]  Well, I mean, obviously, they've got to kill me to totally shut us down.
[02:29:20.851 --> 02:29:21.532]  We're only growing.
[02:29:21.552 --> 02:29:22.313]  It's backfiring.
[02:29:22.333 --> 02:29:23.834]  What are they going to do then if it's backfiring?
[02:29:24.750 --> 02:29:28.113]  No, they're not going to kill you because they don't want you dead.
[02:29:28.153 --> 02:29:29.254]  That would make you a martyr.
[02:29:29.654 --> 02:29:43.925]  They're not that stupid to make somebody a martyr, but they are that incompetent to think that they can put buttons on you, on Riley, on the Fox News, and on the other people who are involved, and then think that they could put pressure.
[02:29:44.425 --> 02:29:46.207]  Trump is not an innocent man.
[02:29:46.467 --> 02:29:50.090]  He has to grow up, he has to focus, and he has to be disciplined.
[02:29:50.390 --> 02:29:51.511]  In other words, there's no excuse.
[02:29:51.551 --> 02:29:51.851]  Hold on.
[02:29:51.891 --> 02:29:54.413]  We'll do a minute or two more on Trump, then we'll go to the next guest in the call.
[02:29:55.975 --> 02:29:58.659]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.147 --> 02:30:05.508]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:30:05.728 --> 02:30:10.551]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[02:30:11.632 --> 02:30:13.914]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[02:30:14.174 --> 02:30:19.557]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:30:19.998 --> 02:30:28.603]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[02:30:28.844 --> 02:30:33.927]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[02:30:34.187 --> 02:30:40.872]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[02:30:41.172 --> 02:30:45.755]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[02:30:45.895 --> 02:30:49.057]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[02:30:49.198 --> 02:30:51.099]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[02:30:51.279 --> 02:30:56.603]  Even better, use coupon code POWER at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[02:30:56.903 --> 02:30:58.884]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[02:30:59.185 --> 02:31:00.886]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[02:31:03.539 --> 02:31:16.083]  Although conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of showing up to her already-canceled speech at Berkeley, that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans from conducting a large First Amendment rally in its place.
[02:31:16.303 --> 02:31:24.465]  Prominent social media icons such as Gavin McInnes, Lauren Southern, Based Stickman, Baked Alaska, Brittany Pettibone, and Faith
[02:31:24.625 --> 02:31:28.629]  Goldie showed up to support free speech and gave speeches.
[02:31:28.870 --> 02:31:37.739]  Reports that the Berkeley police did their job in protecting the peace have come in, and apparently a total of six Antifa protesters were arrested.
[02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:43.486]  Two for resisting arrest, one for a drug violation, and another for possessing a weapon.
[02:31:43.826 --> 02:31:52.215]  Two more arrests were made earlier in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police.
[02:31:52.475 --> 02:31:58.301]  Despite these arrests, the protests remained peaceful and dialogue between both sides was present.
[02:31:58.541 --> 02:32:01.685]  This is Millie Weaver reporting to you for InfoWars.com.
[02:32:07.406 --> 02:32:08.908]  There is a crisis in America today.
[02:32:09.368 --> 02:32:11.771]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[02:32:12.071 --> 02:32:19.478]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[02:32:19.879 --> 02:32:23.483]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[02:32:23.843 --> 02:32:24.984]  I have the answer for you today.
[02:32:25.405 --> 02:32:26.566]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[02:32:27.284 --> 02:32:32.590]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone in its safe, no-radiation compartment.
[02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:38.777]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[02:32:39.618 --> 02:32:42.100]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[02:32:42.301 --> 02:32:48.267]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[02:32:48.968 --> 02:32:50.689]  With the Block-It Pocket, this is impossible.
[02:32:51.149 --> 02:32:53.810]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[02:32:54.150 --> 02:32:58.691]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own Block-It Pocket.
[02:33:17.166 --> 02:33:21.189]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:21.730 --> 02:33:25.693]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:26.273 --> 02:33:43.326]  You know, I don't want to get dramatic here, but we are in a dramatic position, and I'm not that smart, but the media has made me an icon by this creature they've created, this straw man, editing clips out of context of what I say and do to make me look completely wild or crazy.
[02:33:44.582 --> 02:33:47.544]  And it's backfired, just like Trump got in, despite all his warts.
[02:33:48.384 --> 02:33:49.985]  We've all got warts, none of us are perfect.
[02:33:52.107 --> 02:33:59.211]  Because the media is so loathed and hated, they threw everything they had at him, and the worse they got, the more successful he became.
[02:34:00.851 --> 02:34:03.272]  That's the same thing with LePen or myself or anybody.
[02:34:03.432 --> 02:34:06.653]  They've indicted LePen for criticizing Islam.
[02:34:06.673 --> 02:34:09.353]  They've tried to kill Nigel Farage three or four different times.
[02:34:09.393 --> 02:34:11.354]  The police have said they've tried to kill him.
[02:34:12.034 --> 02:34:13.135]  Not the police tried to kill him.
[02:34:13.175 --> 02:34:19.036]  The police have confirmed that they've taken his lug nuts off, cut his brake lines, suspicious stuff with the plane crash.
[02:34:19.696 --> 02:34:21.217]  The pilot's a vegetable, by the way.
[02:34:22.257 --> 02:34:24.258]  So, Farage has got nine lives.
[02:34:24.298 --> 02:34:25.378]  They're coming after us.
[02:34:25.618 --> 02:34:27.399]  And look, I'm not here
[02:34:29.272 --> 02:34:30.832]  Bragging, saying, oh, I'm this great guy.
[02:34:31.232 --> 02:34:37.314]  I don't want to be a slave, but I've gotten a bunch of phone calls by major newspaper reporters.
[02:34:38.134 --> 02:34:40.714]  And they just say, Alex, you really ought to back off.
[02:34:40.734 --> 02:34:41.535]  You're going to be destroyed.
[02:34:42.055 --> 02:34:42.715]  I'm your friend.
[02:34:42.855 --> 02:34:43.335]  I care about you.
[02:34:43.355 --> 02:34:44.335]  And I say, is this a message?
[02:34:45.095 --> 02:34:46.416]  Well, yes, I care about you.
[02:34:49.296 --> 02:34:51.316]  Back down from doing the right thing.
[02:34:52.277 --> 02:34:53.457]  That's what the whole world's about.
[02:34:54.622 --> 02:35:00.447]  is not being scared and wanting to have industry and freedom again and decentralizing power.
[02:35:00.888 --> 02:35:03.050]  Because once you sell out, you'll sell out to anything.
[02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:08.374]  And then the worst people are in control, and whatever their wild dreams are dictate things.
[02:35:08.635 --> 02:35:12.558]  So you're in Venezuela, you're in North Korea, you're in Soviet Russia, sweetheart.
[02:35:13.319 --> 02:35:14.880]  And that's just not who I am.
[02:35:15.020 --> 02:35:15.861]  Not a hero, though.
[02:35:16.041 --> 02:35:16.702]  Let's get that straight.
[02:35:17.182 --> 02:35:18.463]  I am a self-preservationist.
[02:35:19.483 --> 02:35:21.905]  I take it personal people want to enslave us.
[02:35:22.445 --> 02:35:26.268]  I take it personal they want to set up one-sided trade deals and sell out our industry.
[02:35:26.789 --> 02:35:30.512]  They call that being an idiot or old-fashioned.
[02:35:31.653 --> 02:35:35.936]  They sell being a sociopath nowadays as being smart and expedient and cool.
[02:35:36.476 --> 02:35:38.718]  No, it's called pissing in the pool.
[02:35:39.479 --> 02:35:40.239]  Everybody does it.
[02:35:40.299 --> 02:35:41.480]  The pool's ruined, folks.
[02:35:43.294 --> 02:35:44.315]  I'm not a goody two-shoes.
[02:35:44.495 --> 02:35:45.096]  I'm not an idiot.
[02:35:45.276 --> 02:35:46.277]  And I know Pchenik isn't.
[02:35:46.297 --> 02:35:47.998]  We're about to go to Roger Stone and then your calls.
[02:35:48.819 --> 02:35:59.269]  It's just that Stephen Colbert, every night, last week, and for the two weeks, every night, opened his show lying about me with a comedy character.
[02:36:00.209 --> 02:36:01.390]  Very nasty, very mean.
[02:36:02.478 --> 02:36:08.405]  And they open up all these other shows lying, believing they're psychologically inoculating people to make me a joke.
[02:36:08.885 --> 02:36:16.654]  But all they're doing is sending people to find out what's on the show, and then they hear Roger Stone, or Steve Pchenik, or Ron Paul, who's on, what, Wednesday.
[02:36:17.115 --> 02:36:21.239]  Oh, by the way, we have a 30-hour broadcast that I should have mentioned last week.
[02:36:22.793 --> 02:36:33.417]  With big discounts, big specials, and a lot more, with a lot of special guest hosts to help raise more money for all the attacks and the things they've done to us, like kicking us off Google Ads.
[02:36:33.437 --> 02:36:34.878]  That'll be $5 million this year we lose.
[02:36:35.158 --> 02:36:35.778]  Sounds like a lot of money.
[02:36:35.798 --> 02:36:36.598]  That's just to fund things.
[02:36:36.638 --> 02:36:37.219]  That's a loss.
[02:36:37.899 --> 02:36:39.039]  Just on what we have for funding.
[02:36:39.580 --> 02:36:40.980]  We brought in three point something last year.
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.141]  It was going to be $5 million this year of projected ads.
[02:36:44.081 --> 02:36:45.202]  Going after our sponsors.
[02:36:46.022 --> 02:36:49.365]  Hell, taking my kids away from me.
[02:36:49.525 --> 02:36:52.127]  It's really, really fun, let me tell you.
[02:36:52.968 --> 02:36:58.772]  To have the media all perched there, all lying, front page of the paper, openly trying to manipulate the jury.
[02:36:59.713 --> 02:37:01.074]  Just you name it.
[02:37:02.335 --> 02:37:05.117]  Saying, you know, making a referendum on my speech.
[02:37:06.599 --> 02:37:10.262]  That's what this has become, ladies and gentlemen, and so they pretty much
[02:37:11.391 --> 02:37:15.392]  They've only energized me that much more, to be more focused and fight harder.
[02:37:15.652 --> 02:37:21.213]  But they hate me because I have energy, I have life force, and I'm willing to stand up and not roll over.
[02:37:21.433 --> 02:37:25.094]  And they just want to intimidate everybody else by crushing me in public.
[02:37:25.655 --> 02:37:26.535]  They think you're cowards.
[02:37:26.575 --> 02:37:27.615]  People used to always accuse me.
[02:37:27.655 --> 02:37:32.356]  I'm going to say this in closing, then I'll put you in a finish on saying Trump is not a man without sin.
[02:37:32.436 --> 02:37:34.237]  No, certainly not.
[02:37:34.597 --> 02:37:35.137]  Not a piker.
[02:37:36.957 --> 02:37:39.218]  But we believe he actually wants to empower the country and the people.
[02:37:40.245 --> 02:37:47.811]  I always get these questions, if you're fear-mongering to scare people, you must be helping the government, scaring people about how dangerous it is, so they don't get involved.
[02:37:48.732 --> 02:37:57.579]  And I was later told, until about a decade ago, the government actually thought that's what I was doing, not on purpose, but leave him there, he says all the horrible stuff we do, and just scares people that are awake.
[02:37:58.420 --> 02:37:59.380]  I thought you were like me.
[02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:04.945]  You wouldn't get scared, you'd get motivated to do something, knowing there's no other hope but to take action.
[02:38:05.145 --> 02:38:05.565]  And you know what?
[02:38:05.585 --> 02:38:06.546]  They miscalculated.
[02:38:06.846 --> 02:38:08.488]  You were the people I thought you were.
[02:38:09.124 --> 02:38:09.905]  You're just like me.
[02:38:10.165 --> 02:38:10.926]  Just like Pachinik.
[02:38:11.306 --> 02:38:11.826]  Anybody else.
[02:38:12.247 --> 02:38:13.067]  It's beating in our heart.
[02:38:13.127 --> 02:38:14.168]  We're not going to be slaves.
[02:38:14.408 --> 02:38:15.469]  We take it personal.
[02:38:15.710 --> 02:38:16.750]  We're not going to be run over.
[02:38:17.691 --> 02:38:19.172]  And that's what's happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:19.353 --> 02:38:20.554]  You take the Armenian genocide.
[02:38:20.574 --> 02:38:21.835]  I just went and saw that movie, The Promise.
[02:38:22.115 --> 02:38:22.715]  Very accurate.
[02:38:22.755 --> 02:38:23.296]  Very powerful.
[02:38:23.996 --> 02:38:24.757]  Two and a half hours long.
[02:38:24.777 --> 02:38:25.598]  I recommend you go see it.
[02:38:27.319 --> 02:38:31.503]  Ladies and gentlemen, the only Armenians that lived were those that fought.
[02:38:32.537 --> 02:38:39.520]  You know, I'm not going to sit there while they first shut down the press, then they shut down the businesses, then they push you into the hills, then they kill you.
[02:38:39.980 --> 02:38:41.001]  That's what's happening.
[02:38:41.481 --> 02:38:42.521]  So, Pchenik, I'm ranting.
[02:38:42.721 --> 02:38:46.483]  Finish up, then we're going to, of course, Roger Stone, who's got breaking news.
[02:38:46.943 --> 02:38:49.725]  But they are coming after, obviously, everybody.
[02:38:49.945 --> 02:38:52.606]  And the listeners need to know, by coming after myself and others,
[02:38:53.146 --> 02:38:57.948]  They are coming after everybody because they fear the populist movement and focal points of it.
[02:38:58.208 --> 02:39:00.329]  And there is a civil war inside government, as you were saying.
[02:39:00.369 --> 02:39:01.950]  But just your brief message to Trump.
[02:39:02.270 --> 02:39:06.912]  Thanks for holding while I broke that down about saying, look, he's not without, you know, sin.
[02:39:07.192 --> 02:39:08.253]  He needs to grow up.
[02:39:08.313 --> 02:39:08.613]  Go ahead.
[02:39:09.810 --> 02:39:14.874]  The key here is he's got to get rid of Ivanka and he's got to get rid of Jared Kushner.
[02:39:15.034 --> 02:39:19.358]  If he wants to bring his family in, let him bring in Eric and Donald Jr.
[02:39:19.458 --> 02:39:20.079]  That's fine.
[02:39:20.279 --> 02:39:22.681]  They represented what we talked about.
[02:39:23.141 --> 02:39:24.983]  But let me tell you one statement.
[02:39:25.303 --> 02:39:27.985]  Hitler always said to his German public,
[02:39:28.766 --> 02:39:32.989]  Who will ever remember the Armenian Genocide?
[02:39:33.009 --> 02:39:37.733]  1.3 million Armenians were killed by the Turks with the help of the Germans.
[02:39:38.433 --> 02:39:43.537]  And nobody ever remembered the Armenian Genocide when the Jews were then rounded up
[02:39:43.697 --> 02:39:48.099]  The Catholics were rounded up, the Protestants were rounded up, the Lutherans.
[02:39:48.239 --> 02:39:57.664]  Most people don't remember that the evisceration of Catholicism and Lutheranism started in the 1930s under Hitler.
[02:39:57.864 --> 02:40:03.787]  He could never have gotten to power if all the Lutheran priests had been there, or ministers, or even the Protestants.
[02:40:03.847 --> 02:40:05.048]  He put them all in Dachau.
[02:40:05.448 --> 02:40:07.709]  They were killed way before the Jews were.
[02:40:08.209 --> 02:40:10.831]  So, I'm not saying we're in that situation.
[02:40:11.011 --> 02:40:13.292]  I am saying that America, stay alert.
[02:40:14.436 --> 02:40:15.496]  You know, be prepared.
[02:40:15.916 --> 02:40:17.437]  The revolution is not over.
[02:40:17.697 --> 02:40:19.237]  Success is not given.
[02:40:19.657 --> 02:40:22.978]  You have to always earn that right to be an American.
[02:40:23.398 --> 02:40:26.058]  Our generals have not really understood that very well.
[02:40:26.118 --> 02:40:43.882]  They thought just by going into a battle and wearing a lot of fruit salad, that meant something to people like me and others who didn't need the uniform, who didn't need the fruit salad, who didn't need the pension, because we wanted to go out and fail and make ourselves a success in the American system, in the American
[02:40:43.882 --> 02:40:44.242]  Thank you.
[02:40:58.661 --> 02:40:59.642]  Enough is enough.
[02:40:59.722 --> 02:41:05.586]  We're not sending our boys and girls and others to war so that they can be killed for your profits.
[02:41:05.706 --> 02:41:06.167]  That's right.
[02:41:06.427 --> 02:41:15.413]  And it's part of the Nuremberg Trials that Hitler, in 1939, when he started going into Poland, Czechoslovakia and other areas starting World War II, he said, who would remember the Armenian Genocide?
[02:41:15.774 --> 02:41:17.715]  And the Armenian Genocide was used as the model in 1943.
[02:41:18.255 --> 02:41:23.019]  When Hitler started to fail, he said, just kill all the slave labor, Jews, you name it.
[02:41:23.879 --> 02:41:28.202]  You know, Colts were killed, Catholics were killed, this was not just Jewish pain.
[02:41:28.282 --> 02:41:35.047]  And he said, we got away with the Armenian genocide, so they're not going to care here, and that is a perfect example of what we're dealing with.
[02:41:35.687 --> 02:41:39.790]  So again, when you said Trump's not perfect, obviously, do you think they've got him blackmailed?
[02:41:40.908 --> 02:41:42.129]  I don't know whether they got it.
[02:41:42.329 --> 02:41:45.151]  I don't rationalize a man who's in power.
[02:41:45.251 --> 02:41:52.856]  He has to explain to me and to the American public what he's going to do, how he's going to accomplish that, and not become mercurial.
[02:41:53.216 --> 02:42:07.386]  He has to become the President of the United States, which means he has to focus, he has to be disciplined, he has to fire people, which he can't do, I understand from his past history, and he has to be able to stay on course.
[02:42:07.746 --> 02:42:10.108]  If he can't, then we'd be happy to take...
[02:42:11.048 --> 02:42:13.810]  Replace him with someone else, but this can't continue.
[02:42:14.110 --> 02:42:16.091]  Dr. Pachinik, StevePachinik.com, good to talk to you.
[02:42:16.111 --> 02:42:16.651]  Thank you so much.
[02:42:17.011 --> 02:42:18.432]  Thank you, Alex, and God bless you.
[02:42:18.452 --> 02:42:18.932]  God bless you.
[02:42:18.952 --> 02:42:23.635]  And we're going to go now to our next guest, and I promise before I end this broadcast, Beto, Jessica, Skits, I'm going to all of you.
[02:42:23.655 --> 02:42:24.415]  I appreciate you holding.
[02:42:24.675 --> 02:42:27.017]  Roger Stone's got some breaking news for us.
[02:42:27.337 --> 02:42:27.957]  I want to be clear.
[02:42:28.537 --> 02:42:36.602]  When I'm critical of Trump, it's because I support him, I like him, I like all the good things, the three trillion in the stock market, the small business numbers being good.
[02:42:37.659 --> 02:42:48.762]  Controlling our border, illegals 43% down, coming across, going after ISIS, cleaning up Obama's mess, killing TPP, getting a great Supreme Court justice on.
[02:42:49.162 --> 02:42:50.662]  I'm very thankful to Trump overall.
[02:42:51.162 --> 02:42:57.664]  But to see him go from a perfect trajectory to a few degrees off, over time a few degrees takes you back to where you came from.
[02:42:58.084 --> 02:42:59.304]  Turns into a circle pretty soon.
[02:43:00.064 --> 02:43:02.707]  Alex, first of all, it's great to see you back in the Senate.
[02:43:02.727 --> 02:43:04.509]  You know, I agree that in the, I don't know, 38, 40 years
[02:43:25.410 --> 02:43:27.512]  Well, I think
[02:43:45.452 --> 02:43:46.752]  You know, a parody of you.
[02:43:48.073 --> 02:43:57.816]  And where they play with our algorithms and manipulate through their fake news blockers and Snopes and others, they seek to strangle our message.
[02:43:58.676 --> 02:44:03.357]  So I, you know, first let me say I've got your back in this fight.
[02:44:03.417 --> 02:44:15.361]  This is going to be the greatest fight as we go forward, because the way they destroy us, as you know, is to kill our First Amendment rights, to take away our platform, and to end
[02:44:15.401 --> 02:44:17.662]  End of free press in America, as we know.
[02:44:17.682 --> 02:44:22.363]  You know, it's important you say that, because I always get caught up in the news and don't explain it, that, you know, we're the beta test.
[02:44:22.764 --> 02:44:24.024]  They kicked you off Adderall.
[02:44:24.064 --> 02:44:25.144]  They kicked you off Google.
[02:44:25.444 --> 02:44:26.965]  They're doing all the same stuff to you.
[02:44:26.985 --> 02:44:28.045]  There's a long list of us.
[02:44:28.786 --> 02:44:31.447]  They have Colbert and others attack us every night with lies.
[02:44:31.667 --> 02:44:36.328]  All the major news channels, CBS, ABC, NBC, saying Alex said he's a fake.
[02:44:36.728 --> 02:44:37.669]  Alex said he's a racist.
[02:44:37.689 --> 02:44:38.509]  He's a cult leader.
[02:44:38.709 --> 02:44:39.629]  He lost his kids.
[02:44:40.149 --> 02:44:40.950]  On and on and on.
[02:44:41.090 --> 02:44:43.971]  Total concerted assault on every front.
[02:44:44.651 --> 02:44:53.623]  And when you pull back and look at it, then they're strangling us, blocking us, not even having us on the shows, not having us in Congress when they call us Russian agents with no proof.
[02:44:54.064 --> 02:44:57.608]  So they're blocking us on our own platforms while not letting us respond.
[02:44:58.049 --> 02:44:59.171]  I mean, it is unprecedented.
[02:45:00.182 --> 02:45:10.049]  Well, but let me just say that if you sit back and look at it, I would remind you of a line that they actually show in this trailer for Get Me Roger Stone.
[02:45:10.570 --> 02:45:13.432]  Alex, they would not hate you if you were not affected.
[02:45:13.952 --> 02:45:19.457]  The reason why they've got to take you out and InfoWars out is because you have been, indeed.
[02:45:20.097 --> 02:45:21.038]  The tip of the spear.
[02:45:21.498 --> 02:45:31.004]  You have provided a platform for the truth to so many others, including those who work with you right there, you know, in the InfoWars.
[02:45:31.024 --> 02:45:31.724]  Sure, let's be clear.
[02:45:31.784 --> 02:45:37.167]  We then produce the Americana truth-based talking points that take over Talk Radio, take over Fox.
[02:45:37.568 --> 02:45:42.491]  They now know, it's not just us, but yes, we've who they've chosen to destroy.
[02:45:42.551 --> 02:45:49.555]  So I hope listeners understand, when they buy the products, when they spread the links, when they thank the local stations for carrying us, it is an act of total resistance.
[02:45:49.835 --> 02:45:51.280]  Roger, I think they're going to fail.
[02:45:51.320 --> 02:45:51.802]  What do you think?
[02:45:57.261 --> 02:45:57.941]  It's a homage.
[02:45:58.401 --> 02:46:02.123]  It's a homage to your effectiveness as one of the leaders in this fight.
[02:46:02.263 --> 02:46:24.091]  And look, I think if you look across the board, it's people like Mike Cernovich, and the folks at Breitbart, and the folks at The Daily Caller, and the folks at InfoWars, and the folks at Town Hall, and so many other great alternative sites that are committed to the truth, where there's better investigative journaling than you can see at CNN, by the way.
[02:46:24.571 --> 02:46:27.974]  Heartening to see people chanting at the Trump rally.
[02:46:28.074 --> 02:46:29.175]  CNN sucks.
[02:46:29.575 --> 02:46:33.978]  CNN sucks and having CNN have it on air for a snippet.
[02:46:34.379 --> 02:46:35.239]  Really refreshing.
[02:46:36.180 --> 02:46:36.640]  Absolutely.
[02:46:36.660 --> 02:46:38.882]  Well, my friend, what is the big breaking news today?
[02:46:39.462 --> 02:46:53.353]  Well, I can now tell you authoritatively, Alex, that the president has been informed of the coming resignation of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy through a back channel.
[02:46:58.970 --> 02:47:13.896]  The front-runner in that sweepstake is clearly Judge Neil Hartigan from the Western District of Pennsylvania.
[02:47:13.956 --> 02:47:17.637]  Now, Hartigan was thought to be the runner-up
[02:47:20.964 --> 02:47:21.764]  We're good to go.
[02:47:32.807 --> 02:47:38.028]  He is a conservative, not necessarily a libertarian conservative.
[02:47:38.288 --> 02:47:39.629]  So you're giving us the exclusive?
[02:47:39.649 --> 02:47:41.649]  This hasn't broken yet?
[02:47:41.729 --> 02:47:43.189]  This has not broken yet.
[02:47:43.289 --> 02:48:00.013]  Let me continue, if I may, and say that Senator Charles Grassley has his own candidate who is not Judge Hartigan for this slot and has made the White House very aware of the
[02:48:04.267 --> 02:48:07.789]  But the big news is that Justice Kennedy is stepping down.
[02:48:13.464 --> 02:48:17.128]  I think that's the news, but I also think a quick handicap is crucial here.
[02:48:17.549 --> 02:48:25.017]  Hardigan the frontrunner, Grassley with his own candidate that we will identify here at Info Wars, perhaps when we get together.
[02:48:25.037 --> 02:48:30.903]  And then of course the dark horse in this, and this is very important, Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[02:48:30.963 --> 02:48:34.487]  Now what's not known, Alex, is whether the President
[02:48:35.208 --> 02:48:35.308]  Yes.
[02:48:53.493 --> 02:48:56.736]  Well, a little bird told me, and I checked with another bird, that
[02:49:09.676 --> 02:49:15.300]  Trump promised to go off the list for the first one but said on the second one he was leaning towards Napolitano.
[02:49:15.540 --> 02:49:16.220]  Was that accurate?
[02:49:17.381 --> 02:49:18.242]  I had heard that too.
[02:49:18.282 --> 02:49:26.087]  I think what he said was he was leaning towards a more libertarian oriented choice and we know that he's
[02:49:26.627 --> 02:49:27.227]  Pardon me.
[02:49:27.267 --> 02:49:28.727]  You're absolutely right.
[02:49:28.747 --> 02:49:31.768]  Look, Felix Frankfurter was a state jurist, I believe, before going to the bench.
[02:49:31.868 --> 02:49:32.428]  One of the greatest
[02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:52.581]  Supreme Court justices.
[02:49:52.621 --> 02:49:57.925]  So this is going to cause a ripple in official Washington.
[02:49:59.086 --> 02:50:09.355]  The president clearly, as I said earlier, has been told that a letter from Justice Kennedy is supposedly imminent.
[02:50:09.875 --> 02:50:11.836]  All right, we're gonna get a transcript of this out right now.
[02:50:11.936 --> 02:50:18.618]  Roger Stone, the president, has been told that the letter is imminent of Justice Kennedy's resignation.
[02:50:18.918 --> 02:50:26.101]  Let's put that out right now and get this snipped out this last five minutes and put up on YouTube and Facebook as soon as possible.
[02:50:26.461 --> 02:50:28.322]  And of course, you've given us so many big exclusives.
[02:50:28.802 --> 02:50:36.125]  I guess this will be one more fake news story like Cernovich getting it directly from the White House that it was Susan Rice that did the leaking.
[02:50:37.125 --> 02:50:38.326]  Well, let me say this, Alex.
[02:50:38.566 --> 02:50:39.206]  Now that we have
[02:50:43.646 --> 02:50:44.986]  Sure, sure.
[02:50:45.446 --> 02:50:48.027]  Well, the statesman's asking, is he getting ready?
[02:50:48.047 --> 02:50:49.488]  You say the word, as he is.
[02:51:03.477 --> 02:51:05.238]  You provided, Alex, with the caveman?
[02:51:05.258 --> 02:51:07.319]  Well, so we've been formulating this stuff for a while.
[02:51:07.379 --> 02:51:10.782]  We've been getting these different flavors and, you know, oh, I don't know about this one.
[02:51:11.242 --> 02:51:14.585]  You know, and so I've been taking that stuff and I'm an old man.
[02:51:14.825 --> 02:51:14.885]  I'm 42.
[02:51:15.585 --> 02:51:17.767]  I work out five times a week, if not more.
[02:51:17.927 --> 02:51:19.408]  I hear you're okay in jujitsu.
[02:51:21.330 --> 02:51:22.451]  No, I'm not.
[02:51:22.511 --> 02:51:23.152]  I'm terrible.
[02:51:23.192 --> 02:51:23.752]  I'm terrible.
[02:51:23.852 --> 02:51:30.999]  But, the point is, is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and, you know, this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[02:51:31.600 --> 02:51:38.827]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula, has just worked magic for me.
[02:51:38.847 --> 02:51:42.331]  And that's just, you know, that's just from my personal experience.
[02:51:43.712 --> 02:51:48.956]  I think they're great products, and I think if anybody else has those issues, that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[02:51:48.996 --> 02:51:52.079]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[02:51:52.479 --> 02:51:53.760]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[02:51:54.160 --> 02:51:55.341]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[02:51:55.421 --> 02:51:56.562]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[02:51:56.582 --> 02:52:03.748]  Dude and I play basketball, and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball, my knees are barking.
[02:52:04.348 --> 02:52:06.289]  Yeah.
[02:52:06.309 --> 02:52:11.972]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[02:52:12.012 --> 02:52:13.713]  I felt it immediately.
[02:52:13.933 --> 02:52:15.954]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[02:52:16.034 --> 02:52:19.115]  Like, I'm really picky and I will drink it.
[02:52:19.295 --> 02:52:20.276]  It tastes good to me.
[02:52:20.376 --> 02:52:24.318]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[02:52:24.358 --> 02:52:26.399]  So, I mean, if the bone broth
[02:52:29.100 --> 02:52:30.181]  Bone broth!
[02:52:30.241 --> 02:52:35.383]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[02:52:35.403 --> 02:52:39.145]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[02:52:39.185 --> 02:52:46.948]  So ladies, get yourself some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[02:52:47.008 --> 02:52:52.171]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my... Maybe get it for your wife then too, or girlfriend.
[02:52:52.911 --> 02:52:55.614]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street.
[02:52:55.634 --> 02:52:58.896]  I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[02:52:58.916 --> 02:53:00.177]  No fear, nothing.
[02:53:01.169 --> 02:53:08.511]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[02:53:09.071 --> 02:53:10.872]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[02:53:11.592 --> 02:53:22.135]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[02:53:22.195 --> 02:53:23.435]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[02:53:23.475 --> 02:53:29.577]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[02:53:30.837 --> 02:53:33.099]  A borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[02:53:33.139 --> 02:53:35.340]  This is all money that's come from you, the listeners.
[02:53:35.360 --> 02:53:43.446]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[02:53:43.466 --> 02:53:46.808]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[02:53:46.828 --> 02:53:49.690]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[02:53:49.790 --> 02:53:54.833]  So once again, we got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us.
[02:53:55.874 --> 02:54:02.721]  Even when we make mistakes and even when we're not right and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us and I appreciate that.
[02:54:30.928 --> 02:54:34.510]  All right, I'm going to come back and take your phone calls and then David Knight's coming in, but I promise to get to him.
[02:54:34.530 --> 02:54:35.350]  I appreciate you holding.
[02:54:36.711 --> 02:54:38.672]  Roger Stones, our guest, StoneColdTruth.com.
[02:54:38.792 --> 02:54:39.953]  We need your financial support.
[02:54:39.973 --> 02:54:46.796]  We have great supplements, nutraceuticals, Patriot Apparel, fluoride-free iodine-slash-colloidal silver toothpastes back in.
[02:54:47.557 --> 02:54:49.458]  That, of course, is Super Blue, the adult formula.
[02:54:49.658 --> 02:54:52.860]  We have the child's formula as well, bubblegum flavor, a natural flavor.
[02:54:54.144 --> 02:55:01.949]  We also have the bone broth, tumeric, paleo formula that's so good with chaga, mushrooms, and tumeric, and bee pollen, and so much more.
[02:55:02.009 --> 02:55:06.252]  Caveman Ultimate Paleo, just an amazing formulation for your body.
[02:55:06.532 --> 02:55:07.293]  There's so many things.
[02:55:07.313 --> 02:55:09.394]  Go research it at infowarestore.com.
[02:55:09.414 --> 02:55:09.714]  That's 53% off.
[02:55:11.584 --> 02:55:12.665]  Because it's already a best-seller.
[02:55:12.805 --> 02:55:15.627]  I want people to get introduced to it and see how great it is.
[02:55:16.368 --> 02:55:21.091]  We also have 50% off super blue fluoride-free toothpastes back in, and 30% off liver shield.
[02:55:21.111 --> 02:55:24.174]  You can also get it with the oxy powder and do the liver cleanse.
[02:55:24.554 --> 02:55:25.755]  Does everything I expected.
[02:55:26.015 --> 02:55:30.218]  Has nearly everything I've ever used for liver cleansing all rolled into one easy-to-take formula.
[02:55:30.558 --> 02:55:33.901]  That's Boy Blue, Duncannon, Pennsylvania.
[02:55:33.921 --> 02:55:36.303]  So thank you for the five-star review.
[02:55:37.554 --> 02:55:39.035]  We also have the Survival Seed Vault.
[02:55:39.235 --> 02:55:43.599]  Amazing seeds, highest quality, 30% off out of the gates for your summer garden.
[02:55:44.020 --> 02:55:48.744]  Okay, in closing, other information on your radar that you'd like to get into, Roger?
[02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:53.433]  Well, Alex, first of all, let me apologize to your viewers.
[02:55:53.533 --> 02:55:55.354]  I have a little sinus condition.
[02:55:55.414 --> 02:56:00.738]  I ran out of some of my Better Info Wars products on my last two weeks on a hard road trip.
[02:56:00.798 --> 02:56:09.824]  Now that I'm back to Florida, I have found that my latest orders, particularly of your liver cleanse package, are in, so I'll be back in the pink here.
[02:56:09.884 --> 02:56:13.587]  But Alex, I really think that this attack on you
[02:56:14.447 --> 02:56:17.868]  It really needs to be seen in the right context.
[02:56:17.988 --> 02:56:19.668]  It's not about Alex Jones.
[02:56:19.688 --> 02:56:23.389]  It's about your effectiveness in terms of the movement.
[02:56:23.629 --> 02:56:24.210]  It's an attack on us.
[02:56:24.230 --> 02:56:25.710]  It's an attack on everybody.
[02:56:26.150 --> 02:56:37.193]  I mean, if you saw the charts of our retweets from October and January and today at Stone Cold Truth at StoneZone.com, which is being reinvented.
[02:56:37.193 --> 02:56:37.453]  Thank you.
[02:57:00.214 --> 02:57:01.775]  It's Stalinistic!
[02:57:21.648 --> 02:57:23.449]  In its scope.
[02:57:24.290 --> 02:57:39.700]  On Wednesday, here at InfoWars, I'm going to be with Jacob Engels, who has broken some major stories exposing pro-Islamic activities in the academic world and in government.
[02:57:40.321 --> 02:57:46.765]  Soros has now been caught funding local candidates and the Soros organization had threatened
[02:57:47.345 --> 02:57:47.625]  Oh yeah!
[02:58:03.395 --> 02:58:10.418]  Soros last year was in the WikiLeaks saying, once the UN has control, we're going to shut down all the stories that aren't for us, we'll control the news.
[02:58:10.778 --> 02:58:11.838]  This guy is incredible.
[02:58:12.058 --> 02:58:14.960]  So it's not just me, they're going after everybody in live time.
[02:58:14.980 --> 02:58:18.001]  It's George Soros, he was the first
[02:58:19.389 --> 02:58:20.310]  Alex, it's a badge of honor.
[02:58:37.330 --> 02:58:43.499]  And you and I and Pacific and a handful of others, Cernovich, Bannon... Well, listeners know what's happening.
[02:58:43.519 --> 02:58:44.200]  They're supporting us.
[02:58:44.240 --> 02:58:44.901]  They're right here with us.
[02:58:44.942 --> 02:58:49.268]  Folks, go to Infowarsstore.com, buy the product, spread the articles, and pray for us.
[02:58:49.508 --> 02:58:50.690]  Thank you so much, Roger.
[02:58:50.870 --> 02:58:52.553]  We'll be back with a few calls and then David Knight.
[02:58:53.502 --> 02:59:06.066]  Although conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of showing up to her already-canceled speech at Berkeley, that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans from conducting a large First Amendment rally in its place.
[02:59:06.306 --> 02:59:14.428]  Prominent social media icons such as Gavin McInnes, Lauren Southern, Based Stickman, Baked Alaska, Brittany Pettibone, and Faith
[02:59:14.608 --> 02:59:18.612]  Goldie showed up to support free speech and gave speeches.
[02:59:18.833 --> 02:59:27.742]  Reports that the Berkeley police did their job in protecting the peace have come in, and apparently a total of six Antifa protesters were arrested.
[02:59:27.963 --> 02:59:33.469]  Two for resisting arrest, one for a drug violation, and another for possessing a weapon.
[02:59:33.809 --> 02:59:42.193]  Two more arrests were made earlier in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police.
[02:59:42.433 --> 02:59:48.276]  Despite these arrests, the protests remained peaceful and dialogue between both sides was present.
[02:59:48.496 --> 02:59:51.778]  This is Millie Weaver reporting to you for InfoWars.com.
[02:59:54.459 --> 03:00:00.362]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:04.063 --> 03:00:05.924]  I've been everywhere, man.
[03:00:06.264 --> 03:00:08.045]  I've been everywhere, man.
[03:00:08.205 --> 03:00:10.146]  Across the desert, there, man.
[03:00:10.327 --> 03:00:12.208]  I've breathed the mountain air, man.
[03:00:12.448 --> 03:00:14.469]  I've traveled like I had my share, man.
[03:00:14.789 --> 03:00:16.530]  I've been everywhere.
[03:00:16.730 --> 03:00:19.191]  The world is a dangerous place.
[03:00:19.231 --> 03:00:23.954]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:00:24.414 --> 03:00:29.577]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:29.597 --> 03:00:31.098]  Alright, let's go to a Roku viewer.
[03:00:32.409 --> 03:00:33.370]  Vito in Iowa.
[03:00:33.390 --> 03:00:34.351]  Thanks for holding so long.
[03:00:34.391 --> 03:00:35.692]  I just wanted to get to you though.
[03:00:35.732 --> 03:00:36.373]  Go ahead, Vito.
[03:00:37.414 --> 03:00:39.175]  Thank you, Mr. Jones.
[03:00:39.215 --> 03:00:40.356]  I appreciate you taking my call.
[03:00:41.237 --> 03:00:44.340]  The 100 days of Donald Trump, I think they've actually been pretty good.
[03:00:44.380 --> 03:00:47.803]  I mean, considering the administration we've had the past, well, decades.
[03:00:48.184 --> 03:00:51.366]  I mean, you look through TPP, the freeze on non-military federal employees.
[03:00:51.527 --> 03:00:53.108]  I mean, the low numbers across the board.
[03:00:53.128 --> 03:00:54.089]  Cutting the year end by half.
[03:00:54.109 --> 03:00:54.529]  All of it.
[03:00:54.589 --> 03:00:55.350]  It's pretty good, yeah.
[03:00:55.751 --> 03:00:58.273]  But, I mean, starting war with Russia for no reason doesn't look too good, though.
[03:00:59.508 --> 03:01:05.172]  Oh yeah, I mean, that's what I wanted to bring up, the criticisms of him doing the massage, NATO, Russia.
[03:01:05.732 --> 03:01:12.056]  I would like to repeal Obamacare instead of replacing it, and then the takedown of Flynn, and then Bannon being pushed back.
[03:01:12.096 --> 03:01:16.218]  I mean, my buddy and I have a podcast every week, so we try to really figure out what's going on.
[03:01:16.298 --> 03:01:21.442]  I think it's the people that are surrounding Trump and trying to, you know, be nice to him.
[03:01:21.462 --> 03:01:24.604]  Like, Kushner, I think, is someone we have to look at.
[03:01:24.624 --> 03:01:28.346]  Yeah, do you think Kushner's just intimidated by all the pressure, or do you think he's an operative?
[03:01:29.480 --> 03:01:35.544]  Well, PatDollar.com came out and said that George Soros put $258 million into him.
[03:01:35.884 --> 03:01:38.766]  Actually, that was in the Washington Post and the New York Times.
[03:01:39.166 --> 03:01:42.208]  He actually did get George Soros funding about three years ago.
[03:01:43.456 --> 03:01:48.459]  Yeah, and then you put that New York Times article with the Steinmetz family and then the Communist Chinese.
[03:01:48.479 --> 03:01:51.000]  Well, you know why he invested all that in that 666 building?
[03:01:51.320 --> 03:01:53.302]  Kushner's doing horrible management, he's gonna lose it.
[03:01:53.882 --> 03:01:59.025]  So the reason, you know, that's what Soros goes and invests in things he thinks are gonna go belly up.
[03:01:59.765 --> 03:02:04.188]  I don't know that shows he's working for Soros, it just shows that he's beholden to Soros though, yes.
[03:02:05.307 --> 03:02:07.209]  They're just, it's business.
[03:02:07.329 --> 03:02:08.550]  It's what's from the Godfathers.
[03:02:08.570 --> 03:02:10.331]  It's not personal, it's just business.
[03:02:11.713 --> 03:02:13.774]  And they're a bunch of sociopaths and it's got to stop.
[03:02:13.815 --> 03:02:14.976]  Vito, thank you so much.
[03:02:15.336 --> 03:02:15.876]  I agree with you.
[03:02:17.238 --> 03:02:19.159]  We're probably about to see another good Supreme Court Justice.
[03:02:19.199 --> 03:02:20.480]  I mean, thank God Trump's there.
[03:02:20.841 --> 03:02:22.922]  It's just sad that he's not as pure as we'd wished.
[03:02:23.583 --> 03:02:25.044]  I mean, we would have had Hillary Clinton.
[03:02:25.745 --> 03:02:28.187]  But I wish he'd do something about the internet censorship and go after Google.
[03:02:29.068 --> 03:02:30.349]  Let's talk to Jessica in Michigan.
[03:02:30.389 --> 03:02:31.250]  Jessica, thanks for holding.
[03:02:33.171 --> 03:02:38.799]  Hey Alex, I've been an info warrior since 2005 and our family has been praying for years.
[03:02:38.819 --> 03:02:40.281]  I just want to say that.
[03:02:40.301 --> 03:02:40.982]  Thank you.
[03:02:41.082 --> 03:02:46.410]  I've been on a paleo ketogenic diet for over a year now and I've been an avid user of bone broth.
[03:02:47.530 --> 03:02:52.211]  I just received Caveman this week, and wow, that is out of this world.
[03:02:52.231 --> 03:02:54.092]  It's next level.
[03:02:54.492 --> 03:03:03.255]  So to be clear, you're already into bone broth and all its great attributes that are known, but then how would you compare other bone broths you've had to Caveman?
[03:03:03.795 --> 03:03:05.555]  I thought I had the best, actually.
[03:03:05.655 --> 03:03:07.636]  I had tried so many different brands.
[03:03:07.716 --> 03:03:08.536]  I thought I had the best.
[03:03:09.317 --> 03:03:14.038]  And I could literally feel the effects within about 20 minutes or so.
[03:03:14.981 --> 03:03:17.166]  And my significant other, same thing.
[03:03:17.286 --> 03:03:19.530]  I just said, hey, you gotta try this.
[03:03:19.611 --> 03:03:20.332]  It's incredible.
[03:03:20.733 --> 03:03:23.959]  We literally keep it in our coffee container now.
[03:03:25.227 --> 03:03:27.188]  I was about to say, Buckley drinks it with coffee.
[03:03:27.208 --> 03:03:28.009]  I don't like it that way.
[03:03:28.329 --> 03:03:31.671]  I like it with milk, with a little bit of ice cubes, as like a shake.
[03:03:31.731 --> 03:03:32.531]  My children love it.
[03:03:32.831 --> 03:03:35.273]  There's so much, I mean, even more glowing with it.
[03:03:35.293 --> 03:03:36.333]  So thank you for the support.
[03:03:36.834 --> 03:03:42.497]  We set out with a big national organic manufacturer to create the Rolls-Royce at an affordable price.
[03:03:42.777 --> 03:03:45.138]  So I'm glad you like it, because it really is an amazing formula.
[03:03:45.778 --> 03:03:46.339]  It is, too.
[03:03:46.399 --> 03:03:47.919]  And thank you for the stickers.
[03:03:48.060 --> 03:03:49.140]  I put them on my car.
[03:03:49.300 --> 03:03:51.021]  I have Trump stickers on my car, too.
[03:03:51.041 --> 03:03:52.462]  And this is another thing I wanted to tell you.
[03:03:53.151 --> 03:03:54.151]  There's no one around here.
[03:03:54.252 --> 03:03:56.753]  I'm in Southeast Michigan, about 20 minutes from Detroit.
[03:03:56.813 --> 03:03:57.853]  I'm right north of Detroit.
[03:03:58.514 --> 03:04:00.514]  People are way too afraid to have them on their car.
[03:04:00.875 --> 03:04:03.736]  And I got this fire in my spirit, just like you.
[03:04:04.136 --> 03:04:05.217]  And I got them on my car.
[03:04:05.277 --> 03:04:07.478]  And I actually had a cop pull me over.
[03:04:07.498 --> 03:04:10.559]  My birthday is in April, and I figured it was for my bags.
[03:04:10.879 --> 03:04:12.820]  And he just wanted to give me a friendly reminder.
[03:04:13.381 --> 03:04:18.483]  But he also wanted to make sure no one was messing with me, because nobody has stickers on their cars around here.
[03:04:19.033 --> 03:04:20.594]  And he thanked me for the support.
[03:04:21.135 --> 03:04:29.020]  And you know, it's just crazy that he wants to make sure I'm safe, but I have a sticker on my car that says, I support President Trump.
[03:04:29.801 --> 03:04:36.446]  What day and age are we living in when I got a sticker that says, I support our president, and I got to be worried about my safety?
[03:04:37.386 --> 03:04:38.627]  It shows what bullies they are.
[03:04:38.667 --> 03:04:42.530]  Believe me, ma'am, I know they have come after me bad.
[03:04:44.201 --> 03:04:49.105]  They have certainly gotten their licks in, and it's getting more intense every week, and it's going to be a test.
[03:04:49.446 --> 03:04:50.647]  I actually look forward to it.
[03:04:51.407 --> 03:04:53.709]  We'll see if my medal's as strong as I claim it is.
[03:04:54.170 --> 03:04:56.111]  Jessica, I really appreciate you and love you.
[03:04:56.131 --> 03:04:56.872]  I love all the listeners.
[03:04:56.912 --> 03:04:58.473]  Thank you for the prayers and support.
[03:04:58.513 --> 03:05:01.316]  I'm going to come back and do a few more calls, but go ahead and bring David Knight in now.
[03:05:08.098 --> 03:05:20.451]  France, specifically Paris, has been hit with six jihadist terror attacks in the last three years, yet just 5% of people in Paris voted for Marine Le Pen.
[03:05:20.472 --> 03:05:21.733]  38% voted for Macron.
[03:05:22.113 --> 03:05:27.399]  Are they happy just continuing to live with terrorism, you know, as Macron said before the vote?
[03:05:27.459 --> 03:05:29.762]  Are they just happy to continue with business as usual?
[03:05:30.746 --> 03:05:45.270]  It's insanity, and the worrying thing is, I hope the pen can do it this time, and I keep gauging that when it will happen is in four years' time, when we have the elections of Holland at the same time as Germany, now because of Theresa May, there'll be elections across Europe in four years' time.
[03:05:45.810 --> 03:05:50.031]  But the worrying thing is that the new generations, or the younger generations, think this is normal.
[03:05:50.531 --> 03:05:53.832]  Because as they're growing up in it, terrorism will become part of everyday life.
[03:05:54.672 --> 03:05:56.494]  Because that's all they've known and all they've seen.
[03:05:56.954 --> 03:06:00.717]  Because for the last four or five years, across Europe, it's just terror, terror, terror.
[03:06:00.817 --> 03:06:05.621]  For the next four years, I think when you look at the arrest rate, they go up 60% a year across Europe.
[03:06:05.921 --> 03:06:09.784]  The attacks are intensifying, they're getting worse, they're getting bigger, they're getting badder.
[03:06:10.205 --> 03:06:14.908]  So it's worrying for the next... I think that the changing point will be the election in four years' time.
[03:06:15.329 --> 03:06:16.550]  But yeah, it's insanity.
[03:06:16.910 --> 03:06:17.711]  And for Paris,
[03:06:18.531 --> 03:06:20.473]  Your mindset seems to be similar to London.
[03:06:20.633 --> 03:06:23.676]  The feminists in France yesterday, they're not upset about this.
[03:06:23.756 --> 03:06:28.921]  They're not... Well, the women are in France, the ones who don't go out and expose themselves, the actual women voters.
[03:06:36.201 --> 03:06:42.923]  Majority voted for Marine Le Pen in France because of the threats they face, because they don't feel safe.
[03:06:43.043 --> 03:06:46.525]  They've done polls where they tell pollsters that they don't feel safe.
[03:06:47.165 --> 03:06:55.868]  She got the most votes from women, yet we have feminists out trying to block people from voting from Marine Le Pen, who would be the first female president of France.
[03:06:56.568 --> 03:07:05.573]  Anti-Le Pen protesters have come here to protest against the fact that the National Front is due to hold a rally in the venue just behind me.
[03:07:05.613 --> 03:07:10.816]  They were saying that they're unhappy with the National Front holding this rally here in Paris.
[03:07:10.856 --> 03:07:18.220]  They call them fascists and they say that they don't want them here and they're calling on people to rise up on the streets in Paris against them.
[03:07:18.980 --> 03:07:21.322]  What is the fundamental disconnect?
[03:07:21.762 --> 03:07:30.567]  I mean, I guess it's just Islamism, feminism, the far left, they all have the general same goal of destabilizing society, overturning everything.
[03:07:30.987 --> 03:07:41.134]  So they've formed this toxic alliance, even though on the surface it's completely contradictory to the ideals of original feminism to protect women and women's rights.
[03:07:42.773 --> 03:07:44.994]  I'm saying there's three stages to it.
[03:07:45.014 --> 03:07:47.694]  There's disbelief, disappointment and acceptance.
[03:07:48.255 --> 03:07:49.455]  And we're all in acceptance.
[03:07:49.535 --> 03:07:50.275]  Well, we're not.
[03:07:50.575 --> 03:07:51.716]  But many are in acceptance.
[03:07:51.776 --> 03:07:53.236]  Acceptance that this is how it is.
[03:07:53.596 --> 03:07:54.596]  This is how it's going to be.
[03:07:54.857 --> 03:07:55.777]  This is what's happening.
[03:07:56.137 --> 03:07:58.478]  And, for example, I went to a court case last week.
[03:07:58.498 --> 03:08:00.518]  28 of them were men.
[03:08:01.218 --> 03:08:01.839]  28 of them.
[03:08:02.139 --> 03:08:02.899]  They're in court.
[03:08:02.919 --> 03:08:03.659]  They're raping.
[03:08:04.159 --> 03:08:05.220]  There was 120 young children identified.
[03:08:07.140 --> 03:08:11.183]  Only 20 wanting to come forward and go through the stress and the chaos that's already caused to their lives.
[03:08:12.263 --> 03:08:15.385]  There's 28 men in a town of Huddersfield.
[03:08:15.405 --> 03:08:16.906]  A small town in North England, you know it.
[03:08:17.026 --> 03:08:18.987]  These men are walking into court like they're gangsters.
[03:08:19.268 --> 03:08:20.848]  They're in court with raping young kids.
[03:08:21.449 --> 03:08:22.850]  I just don't understand the audacity.
[03:08:23.030 --> 03:08:27.873]  And when I talk about the attitude problem that's happening here, you know the security guards in that court were Muslim.
[03:08:28.213 --> 03:08:28.713]  I watched it.
[03:08:28.933 --> 03:08:29.754]  They all shook their hands.
[03:08:30.214 --> 03:08:37.078]  The other people that were Muslim in court for driving offences and other offences who were not part of this rape game, they all shook their hand.
[03:08:37.698 --> 03:08:38.639]  They see no problem.
[03:08:38.679 --> 03:08:40.500]  These men don't have to walk the streets in shame.
[03:08:40.920 --> 03:08:41.921]  They walk their community in prayer.
[03:08:43.081 --> 03:08:43.522]  It's a fact.
[03:08:44.602 --> 03:08:45.923]  The satanic holiday in France.
[03:08:47.284 --> 03:08:49.185]  The Jacobins, the devil worship party.
[03:08:50.526 --> 03:08:52.367]  Killed over a million people in the French Revolution.
[03:08:52.947 --> 03:08:54.868]  They're the model of communism, the Red Terror.
[03:08:54.908 --> 03:08:55.829]  This is their day.
[03:08:57.189 --> 03:08:58.050]  This is their time.
[03:08:59.158 --> 03:09:08.283]  And they're burning and killing and stabbing all over the world and calling for North Korea, calling for Communist China, calling for Venezuela, calling for the wonderland that's collectivism.
[03:09:08.303 --> 03:09:12.665]  I'm going to take a few final calls and calls for a little while with David Knight, and he's taking over at the start of the next segment.
[03:09:12.985 --> 03:09:15.887]  But I wanted to talk to Dean and Skits.
[03:09:15.907 --> 03:09:17.728]  Skits is up next, and then Bubba and Dan.
[03:09:18.068 --> 03:09:20.870]  But I got to tell you, David,
[03:09:21.852 --> 03:09:24.775]  I don't want to make it about us, but notice all these other guests, everybody else are.
[03:09:25.235 --> 03:09:36.025]  Every comedy show, every nightly news show, everywhere, even before the whole custody battle and all that distortion that the media engaged in, it has been the craziest attack
[03:09:37.827 --> 03:09:38.287]  That's right.
[03:09:58.680 --> 03:10:03.723]  We're then like people you've been around for years suddenly like Agent Smith jumping in another body.
[03:10:04.163 --> 03:10:10.047]  It's like people just activate and come at you because they're like signaled by it.
[03:10:10.067 --> 03:10:11.047]  Yeah.
[03:10:11.107 --> 03:10:12.448]  And believe that you're falling.
[03:10:12.488 --> 03:10:16.651]  So they want to pile on like when a crab tries to climb out of a bucket of crabs.
[03:10:16.671 --> 03:10:17.691]  They don't attack the other crabs.
[03:10:17.731 --> 03:10:18.312]  They try to leave.
[03:10:18.652 --> 03:10:20.473]  Meanwhile, we're actually getting stronger.
[03:10:21.134 --> 03:10:28.018]  So I wonder as they intensify the attack for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction, Newtonian physics, as they attack us.
[03:10:29.414 --> 03:10:34.015]  We get more audience, more people, more support, but it is just like neck and neck.
[03:10:35.475 --> 03:10:43.497]  What happens if people double down, buy the product, spread the video, spread it by email, tell people word of mouth about Infowars.com, the forbidden information?
[03:10:45.457 --> 03:10:52.319]  I mean, it's just crazy to see the Federal Reserve Board member attacking us, George Soros' law firm suing us.
[03:10:52.839 --> 03:10:54.239]  I mean, it is amazing.
[03:10:54.872 --> 03:10:59.075]  Well, you know, Alex, one of the things that you know really gets me upset is eminent domain.
[03:10:59.135 --> 03:11:03.278]  I hate to see the government come in and steal people's ranches, steal their mining business, steal their lumber.
[03:11:03.718 --> 03:11:09.842]  And I hate to see somebody come from another country and get subsidized by U.S.
[03:11:09.902 --> 03:11:10.683]  taxpayers.
[03:11:10.863 --> 03:11:11.923]  And that's what's happening here.
[03:11:12.184 --> 03:11:13.945]  How did this guy get so much money?
[03:11:13.985 --> 03:11:15.686]  How did he get so many subsidies?
[03:11:15.726 --> 03:11:20.629]  The subsidized factories, the subsidized workers are trained for him at community colleges.
[03:11:20.689 --> 03:11:22.771]  And of course, it's because of his political connections.
[03:11:23.231 --> 03:11:24.392]  That's what people need to get upset about.
[03:11:24.412 --> 03:11:25.732]  It's the same model as Gulan.
[03:11:25.852 --> 03:11:27.133]  Same thing as the Gulan schools.
[03:11:27.413 --> 03:11:28.553]  Hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S.
[03:11:28.573 --> 03:11:28.774]  money.
[03:11:28.914 --> 03:11:29.434]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:11:29.534 --> 03:11:33.216]  Five hundred million dollars a year when I did the report a couple years ago.
[03:11:33.736 --> 03:11:37.237]  And of course they're growing schools and this network here in America all the time.
[03:11:38.038 --> 03:11:43.720]  And here in America, it's secular, but they push his Turkish connections a great deal.
[03:11:43.760 --> 03:11:45.001]  So what is it about all of this?
[03:11:45.101 --> 03:11:49.683]  I mean, we understand the involvement of the Saudis, and I've got a report here I want to talk about.
[03:11:50.003 --> 03:11:56.969]  The Handmaid's Tale, you know, that story that Margaret Atwood did about this horrific Christian patriarchy that takes over the country.
[03:11:56.989 --> 03:11:58.931]  And they made it into a film with Robert Duvall.
[03:11:59.011 --> 03:11:59.371]  That's right.
[03:11:59.471 --> 03:12:01.713]  Yeah, actually, my wife was an extra in that, Alex.
[03:12:02.194 --> 03:12:02.434]  Wow.
[03:12:02.894 --> 03:12:04.376]  We ought to do a review of that.
[03:12:04.416 --> 03:12:06.557]  In fact, the icon on the TV is the all-seeing eye.
[03:12:06.938 --> 03:12:09.060]  But really, that should have been about Islam.
[03:12:09.140 --> 03:12:09.300]  Yeah.
[03:12:09.580 --> 03:12:10.801]  Exactly, and that's the point.
[03:12:11.141 --> 03:12:19.126]  This is all happening at the same time that they're making Saudi Arabia part of the UN Commission on Women's Rights.
[03:12:19.527 --> 03:12:27.191]  They're already on the Human Rights Commission, now it's women's rights, and you see over the weekend, leftist worldwide war hajibs in solidarity.
[03:12:28.112 --> 03:12:34.559]  And if you look at these pictures of these women who are being subjugated in the Handmaid's Tale, okay?
[03:12:34.599 --> 03:12:36.702]  They're made to wear these costumes and so forth.
[03:12:47.894 --> 03:12:49.534]  And yet their faces are exposed.
[03:12:49.574 --> 03:12:56.176]  I mean, these are people that would be identified in Saudi Arabia as heretic whores.
[03:12:56.696 --> 03:12:58.436]  Infidel whores, that's what they would be calling them.
[03:12:58.956 --> 03:13:06.458]  And all the things that they're talking about in this dystopian novel are going on right now, and yet they're saying, this is reality of Trump's America.
[03:13:06.538 --> 03:13:07.098]  No, it's not!
[03:13:07.118 --> 03:13:09.679]  It's the reality of our allies in Saudi Arabia.
[03:13:09.979 --> 03:13:12.959]  But nobody will say that because of their political connections.
[03:13:13.279 --> 03:13:16.240]  They have so many connections into our monetary system.
[03:13:17.040 --> 03:13:19.342]  You're on fire.
[03:13:19.562 --> 03:13:20.844]  The globalists are the cultists.
[03:13:21.144 --> 03:13:22.745]  They want to destroy Christianity.
[03:13:23.166 --> 03:13:25.067]  That's why they'll ally with Islam, anything.
[03:13:25.128 --> 03:13:27.450]  They want to destroy Christianity.
[03:13:27.690 --> 03:13:31.193]  And George Soros is in the WikiLeaks saying he wants to destroy Israel.
[03:13:31.333 --> 03:13:31.693]  That's right.
[03:13:31.773 --> 03:13:33.555]  And so the ADL says here's more money.
[03:13:34.696 --> 03:13:35.337]  What does that tell you?
[03:13:36.348 --> 03:13:37.529]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[03:13:37.549 --> 03:13:44.852]  When we look at what's going on, as you point out, we welcome this investigation because we did the reports on this, we've talked about this in the past.
[03:13:45.413 --> 03:13:57.919]  How does this kind of stuff happen and yet we can't get anybody to pay any attention to how come a guy who won't say that he's not still a Turkish citizen, how does he get on the New York Fed?
[03:13:58.399 --> 03:14:01.322]  How does he get on the Federal Reserve Board, the one that makes all the policy?
[03:14:02.023 --> 03:14:08.509]  It's absolutely amazing, and this story you just gave me about Jerome Corsi, this is something again we have talked about over and over again.
[03:14:08.529 --> 03:14:13.534]  And by the way, this guy's a total public figure, and he says, oh, my yogurt company doesn't
[03:14:13.894 --> 03:14:14.534]  Bring in people.
[03:14:14.854 --> 03:14:16.295]  Well, of course they don't, technically.
[03:14:16.515 --> 03:14:18.056]  But then he's pushing the refugees.
[03:14:18.096 --> 03:14:18.836]  They're unvetted.
[03:14:19.056 --> 03:14:20.597]  He can't just blame it on the State Department.
[03:14:20.817 --> 03:14:21.538]  But there's the headlines.
[03:14:21.558 --> 03:14:22.458]  The Wall Street Journal, everywhere.
[03:14:23.338 --> 03:14:23.699]  Bloomberg.
[03:14:23.779 --> 03:14:26.120]  Jones sued for linking refugees to rape.
[03:14:26.480 --> 03:14:28.261]  Well, what the hell do you think's happening?
[03:14:28.541 --> 03:14:30.021]  In Europe, they arrest you for it.
[03:14:30.502 --> 03:14:37.305]  See, the whole point of that report that I did, when I did that, was because... It's your report we're being sued for in the headline.
[03:14:38.205 --> 03:14:39.206]  And what's crazier is...
[03:14:40.239 --> 03:14:45.267]  David, they were being sued for saying that the Islamists coming in increased TB.
[03:14:45.688 --> 03:14:46.830]  It did increase in the town 500%.
[03:14:46.870 --> 03:14:48.152]  That's right.
[03:14:48.172 --> 03:14:49.534]  I mean, it's admitted.
[03:14:49.574 --> 03:14:51.297]  So this is just pure intimidation.
[03:14:51.497 --> 03:14:52.239]  But let me ask you this.
[03:14:52.279 --> 03:14:54.302]  I've talked to five top lawyers who've engaged two of them.
[03:14:55.287 --> 03:14:56.989]  Guys that have gone up against these groups before.
[03:14:57.469 --> 03:15:00.873]  People that represented the Boston Herald when the Islamists sued them a few years ago.
[03:15:01.353 --> 03:15:03.175]  And they said, no, it's a pure publicity stunt.
[03:15:03.475 --> 03:15:04.556]  This is a very bad case.
[03:15:04.616 --> 03:15:06.638]  So, what are they even thinking?
[03:15:06.839 --> 03:15:08.180]  Is it just to say I'm fake?
[03:15:08.320 --> 03:15:08.921]  I'm fake?
[03:15:08.941 --> 03:15:10.622]  And hopefully get other people to sue me?
[03:15:10.662 --> 03:15:11.223]  I mean, what is it?
[03:15:11.443 --> 03:15:16.285]  I think they're going to get some very bad publicity out of this, because they don't want people to know what's really going on.
[03:15:16.365 --> 03:15:18.106]  And that was the point of my report!
[03:15:18.146 --> 03:15:28.330]  I said, look, we had these situations with a lot of concern about so many refugees coming into this small town in Idaho, and when this... And the media covered up a year ago that there were the assaults, now they plead guilty?
[03:15:28.510 --> 03:15:37.816]  That's right, they said it was fake news for the longest time, and then at the end of the week, they came in, they closed the case, they said, alright, they've pled guilty, and within a couple of days, 60 Minutes does a puff piece on them.
[03:15:37.976 --> 03:15:45.161]  Doesn't mention the negative consequences or concerns about negative consequences whatsoever, so it simply makes it all about the jobs that he created.
[03:15:45.401 --> 03:15:48.944]  He says, hey, when I bring somebody into this country and I give them a job, they're no longer a refugee.
[03:15:48.984 --> 03:15:52.766]  Well, you know, why aren't you trying to stop the wars in those countries?
[03:15:53.006 --> 03:15:58.390]  We've got seven countries, the same seven countries that Donald Trump said we're going to do extreme vetting on.
[03:15:58.630 --> 03:16:00.291]  Those are countries we're at war with.
[03:16:00.331 --> 03:16:01.431]  We're bombing the people there.
[03:16:01.451 --> 03:16:02.111]  Where is the left?
[03:16:02.131 --> 03:16:06.112]  Why don't they want to talk about stopping the war there for humanitarian purposes?
[03:16:06.132 --> 03:16:06.633]  Oh, exactly.
[03:16:06.933 --> 03:16:08.933]  Oh, I said Sandy Hook made me fake.
[03:16:09.033 --> 03:16:09.774]  I hurt children.
[03:16:09.794 --> 03:16:10.214]  I don't care.
[03:16:10.254 --> 03:16:10.894]  That's not true.
[03:16:11.134 --> 03:16:14.755]  They're the ones launching wars that kill millions, that starve hundreds of thousands to death.
[03:16:14.775 --> 03:16:15.935]  They have blood all over them.
[03:16:16.176 --> 03:16:17.196]  Let's go to a call here.
[03:16:17.316 --> 03:16:19.377]  Skits, you're on the air from Nebraska.
[03:16:19.397 --> 03:16:20.317]  Thanks for being a trooper.
[03:16:20.577 --> 03:16:22.418]  You're on the air worldwide listening on Shortwave.
[03:16:23.338 --> 03:16:23.978]  Thank you, sir.
[03:16:26.239 --> 03:16:27.039]  President Trump.
[03:16:27.779 --> 03:16:36.026]  I started getting worried when that Secret Service agent happened to leave her computer in the car and the computer got stolen.
[03:16:36.106 --> 03:16:36.366]  Yes.
[03:16:36.686 --> 03:16:46.114]  Okay, so I think Mr. Trump, they've got some kind of a hold on him because the moves that he's making were not the moves that I voted for.
[03:16:46.574 --> 03:16:48.896]  What I think he needs to do is, number one,
[03:16:50.615 --> 03:16:55.638]  Give Jared Kushner and his daughter, unfortunately, Ivanka the boot.
[03:16:56.159 --> 03:17:06.166]  Although, I think before he does, he should give his daughter a copy of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution to study, and maybe she'll know what's going on.
[03:17:08.187 --> 03:17:09.548]  Bring back Steve Bannon.
[03:17:09.908 --> 03:17:10.949]  Bring back Flynn.
[03:17:11.289 --> 03:17:15.012]  Get rid of McMaster, who was a Hillary supporter, instead of
[03:17:17.369 --> 03:17:22.070]  Look how they're claiming Flynn's a Russian agent because he got paid to go speak at a TV event in Russia.
[03:17:22.350 --> 03:17:22.550]  Yeah.
[03:17:22.691 --> 03:17:25.331]  Again, you're not allowed to have any contact with Russia or you're a spy.
[03:17:25.671 --> 03:17:29.932]  The biggest problem with Flynn was that he said the words radical Islamic terror.
[03:17:30.292 --> 03:17:37.094]  And of course when he was replaced, the first thing, the very first meeting that McMaster had his replacement said we're not going to use that term.
[03:17:37.274 --> 03:17:37.774]  Absolutely.
[03:17:38.014 --> 03:17:39.375]  David's gonna be taken over here in a minute.
[03:17:39.415 --> 03:17:40.195]  Great point, Skits.
[03:17:40.235 --> 03:17:40.695]  Anything else?
[03:17:41.715 --> 03:17:41.975]  Yes.
[03:17:42.716 --> 03:17:42.996]  Okay.
[03:17:44.440 --> 03:17:45.660]  Get rid of McMaster.
[03:17:47.201 --> 03:17:52.662]  I would say get rid of his Treasury Secretary and bring in Katherine Austen-Fitz.
[03:17:55.003 --> 03:17:56.884]  Let's get Katherine Austen-Fitz back on.
[03:17:57.384 --> 03:17:58.044]  She's a great lady.
[03:17:58.064 --> 03:17:58.784]  We never get her on.
[03:17:58.804 --> 03:17:59.504]  All right, we're out of time.
[03:17:59.524 --> 03:18:02.285]  I've got to jam in one more who's been holding the longest here.
[03:18:02.365 --> 03:18:04.326]  Dean, you're on The Year with David Knight.
[03:18:04.366 --> 03:18:04.686]  Go ahead.
[03:18:05.926 --> 03:18:06.806]  Hey, Alex.
[03:18:06.827 --> 03:18:08.027]  The sleeper has awakened.
[03:18:08.747 --> 03:18:09.607]  Yes, sir.
[03:18:09.787 --> 03:18:10.648]  Yeah, God bless you.
[03:18:12.506 --> 03:18:27.230]  I said an idea for lowering health care, there's Stephen Wiseman at Change.org has a petition for health care pricing which would totally cut the cost in half.
[03:18:27.530 --> 03:18:29.251]  Oh yeah, there's so many great things they could be doing.
[03:18:30.413 --> 03:18:35.577]  Yeah, and I'd also like to say I'm a writer from Milwaukee and I want to help you guys.
[03:18:35.757 --> 03:18:37.218]  I totally believe... Well, let me say this.
[03:18:37.258 --> 03:18:40.901]  Anybody that wants to write op-ed pieces for us or articles, we've got to vet them, obviously.
[03:18:40.921 --> 03:18:43.182]  If you write us a bunch of great articles, we can maybe hire you.
[03:18:43.523 --> 03:18:45.464]  Send them to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[03:18:45.864 --> 03:18:48.106]  I'm intending to try to hire some more reporters as well.
[03:18:48.466 --> 03:18:51.849]  We're going to just expand in the face of this and just hope the support comes through.
[03:18:52.750 --> 03:18:54.172]  Showtips at Infowars.com.
[03:18:54.372 --> 03:18:54.712]  What is it?
[03:18:54.772 --> 03:18:55.774]  Jobs at Infowars?
[03:18:55.794 --> 03:18:58.738]  I think jobs at Infowars.com is an address.
[03:18:58.798 --> 03:19:00.981]  I need to start plugging on air, but that's an ad I need to cut.
[03:19:01.261 --> 03:19:07.951]  But we're looking for more writers, more researchers, more editors, and more crew because I want to start going at least live.
[03:19:08.491 --> 03:19:14.999]  10 hours a day with radio shows and TV shows because the world's moving so fast and every time they try to shut us down, I try to expand.
[03:19:15.040 --> 03:19:15.740]  Dean, I love you.
[03:19:16.061 --> 03:19:16.782]  Thank you so much.
[03:19:16.882 --> 03:19:20.306]  Okay, if you want to get to these other callers, Jason in Germany and others, if you've got time, do it.
[03:19:20.366 --> 03:19:22.969]  If not, David, they'll be fine and understand, but I want to thank the callers.
[03:19:23.290 --> 03:19:24.151]  Got to as many as I could.
[03:19:24.171 --> 03:19:25.252]  I'll be back tomorrow to cover more.
[03:19:26.311 --> 03:19:27.991]  David's coming up the next 40 minutes.
[03:19:28.292 --> 03:19:30.692]  Nightly News tonight 7 o'clock central and more.
[03:19:30.772 --> 03:19:32.153]  We do that new live show 5 to 6.
[03:19:32.313 --> 03:19:35.393]  It's a beta test to train the other crews on live switching.
[03:19:35.714 --> 03:19:36.254]  Look for that.
[03:19:36.414 --> 03:19:36.954]  Tweet it out.
[03:19:37.054 --> 03:19:37.754]  Facebook it out.
[03:19:38.134 --> 03:19:38.674]  Word of mouth.
[03:19:38.714 --> 03:19:39.795]  Spread all the shows.
[03:19:39.895 --> 03:19:42.075]  Infowars.com forward slash show.

[03:19:43.696 --> 03:19:44.556]  We can get you intel.
[03:19:44.856 --> 03:19:45.716]  They're trying to censor.
[03:19:46.056 --> 03:19:47.897]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:19:48.617 --> 03:19:53.939]  53% off on the Caveman Total Paleo Bone Broth Turmeric and more.

[03:19:58.101 --> 03:19:59.682]  We're under attack and these are great products.
[03:20:05.772 --> 03:20:06.613]  Lee Stranahan.
[03:20:06.833 --> 03:20:08.794]  Lee Stranahan was formerly with Breitbart.
[03:20:09.215 --> 03:20:10.475]  He knew Andrew Breitbart.
[03:20:10.515 --> 03:20:12.217]  He also knows Steve Bannon.
[03:20:12.557 --> 03:20:14.798]  He is now the editor of ThePopulous.us.
[03:20:14.858 --> 03:20:17.200]  He's a co-host on Fault Lines on Sputnik.
[03:20:17.781 --> 03:20:20.502]  And he has a citizen journalism school.
[03:20:20.522 --> 03:20:23.164]  You'll find that at citizenjournalismschool.com.
[03:20:23.184 --> 03:20:29.729]  But let's talk about the outsourcing of censorship first and the demonizing of individual sources, Lee.
[03:20:30.009 --> 03:20:32.430]  I don't like the term fake news, okay?
[03:20:32.490 --> 03:20:39.232]  There is such a thing as fake news, but the bigger problem, I think, is what I call narrative-driven news, which is this.
[03:20:39.312 --> 03:20:40.572]  Let's take a simple issue.
[03:20:40.612 --> 03:20:41.952]  I'm going to give just an example.
[03:20:42.712 --> 03:20:44.093]  Let's say immigration, okay?
[03:20:44.453 --> 03:20:48.094]  Now, let's say you've got two stories, and they're both completely true.
[03:20:48.874 --> 03:20:54.416]  One story is about a woman who came here illegally, and she's got three kids.
[03:20:54.496 --> 03:20:59.057]  She, you know, has worked for 20 years, but she's here illegally, and she's getting deported.
[03:20:59.737 --> 03:21:05.964]  The second story is about a woman whose child was killed by an illegal alien who'd been deported three times.
[03:21:06.745 --> 03:21:07.085]  Okay?
[03:21:07.445 --> 03:21:11.089]  Now, assume both of those stories are completely true, because those things both happened.
[03:21:11.149 --> 03:21:11.890]  Does that make sense?
[03:21:12.571 --> 03:21:12.791]  Right.
[03:21:13.432 --> 03:21:15.173]  Which story is CNN gonna cover?
[03:21:15.894 --> 03:21:16.134]  Right?
[03:21:16.495 --> 03:21:16.675]  Yes.
[03:21:16.955 --> 03:21:19.238]  The deportation story of the victim.
[03:21:19.318 --> 03:21:19.518]  Yeah.
[03:21:20.303 --> 03:21:22.124]  And which stories is Breitbart going to cover?
[03:21:22.204 --> 03:21:24.146]  You see what I'm saying?
[03:21:24.886 --> 03:21:35.093]  So my point here is that what they don't like about sites like InfoWars is that you guys cover stories that are outside their narrative.
[03:21:35.473 --> 03:21:37.314]  You're outside their normal lane.
[03:21:37.494 --> 03:21:41.637]  To me, the issue is, are people going to be honest with you about what their bias is?
[03:21:41.677 --> 03:21:42.638]  Everybody's got a bias.
[03:21:42.958 --> 03:21:48.039]  And always in the past we would see the same stories put out by ABC, CBS, NBC.
[03:21:48.079 --> 03:21:51.200]  They would all choose to report the same stories and they would have the same angle.
[03:21:51.680 --> 03:21:54.861]  Now we have people who are coming out with a different narrative.
[03:21:55.461 --> 03:21:57.482]  We report the facts and we analyze the facts.
[03:21:57.842 --> 03:22:02.223]  CNN reports the facts, they analyze the facts, but they tell you that their facts are the only facts.
[03:22:02.743 --> 03:22:05.384]  People can make up their own minds.
[03:22:05.484 --> 03:22:06.964]  And people can figure it out.
[03:22:06.984 --> 03:22:07.565]  You can, I can, David.
[03:22:07.585 --> 03:22:08.705]  All of the audience can.
[03:22:08.725 --> 03:22:09.925]  I can look at a New York Times story.
[03:22:25.050 --> 03:22:28.011]  And I know what their bias is, and I can filter that in.
[03:22:28.091 --> 03:22:34.714]  I can look at an Infowars story, and I know where it comes from, and I can filter that out, and I can make up my own damn mind.
[03:22:35.274 --> 03:22:36.435]  That's what's scary to them.
[03:22:36.955 --> 03:22:39.556]  They're frightened to death that we can make up our own minds.
[03:22:39.896 --> 03:22:47.700]  And the wake-up call for them was Donald Trump being elected, because whatever you thought about Donald Trump, he wasn't supposed to win, right?
[03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:49.060]  He was supposed to lose.
[03:22:49.700 --> 03:22:52.842]  And that's when they realized the genie's out of the bottle.
[03:22:53.542 --> 03:22:55.284]  And they can no longer control us.
[03:22:57.467 --> 03:23:01.371]  It's almost like there's an Info-War going on.
[03:23:03.794 --> 03:23:08.059]  Men, give your body the support it needs with Info-War's Life Prostagard.
[03:23:08.539 --> 03:23:12.343]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.
[03:23:12.944 --> 03:23:23.634]  InfoWars Life has set out to bring you formulations that are not only the highest quality out there, but formulas that you can use on a daily basis to give your body the natural herbs and extracts that our experts recommend.
[03:23:24.174 --> 03:23:31.961]  The Prostagard formula does just that with its mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants that help give your body total support.
[03:23:32.161 --> 03:23:37.086]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols,
[03:23:37.606 --> 03:23:38.467]  We're good.
[03:24:16.283 --> 03:24:17.664]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:17.704 --> 03:24:18.304]  I'm David Knight.
[03:24:18.324 --> 03:24:24.849]  In this fourth hour, we're going to go back to our callers here in just a moment to give you a preview of what's coming up.
[03:24:24.869 --> 03:24:32.754]  We're going to talk a little bit about May Day, what's behind that, but also the poster child for communism that we see today, troubled Venezuela.
[03:24:32.814 --> 03:24:34.955]  And we're going to tell you that's not an aberration.
[03:24:34.975 --> 03:24:37.617]  Of course, you'll hear that every time we talk about Venezuela.
[03:24:37.677 --> 03:24:41.619]  I always get comments from the socialists trolling us on YouTube saying, that's not typical.
[03:24:42.020 --> 03:24:42.580]  That's not typical.
[03:24:42.600 --> 03:24:45.162]  You want to talk about socialism, talk about Sweden.
[03:24:45.842 --> 03:24:48.204]  No, actually, Sweden is going to get there.
[03:24:48.365 --> 03:24:49.025]  They're on their way.
[03:24:49.105 --> 03:24:51.408]  They're just moving at a very slow pace.
[03:24:51.448 --> 03:24:55.412]  And they had much further to fall before they get to the point of Venezuela.
[03:24:55.472 --> 03:25:01.758]  No, Venezuela is now where all of these dictatorships, these kleptocracies are eventually going to wind up.
[03:25:01.778 --> 03:25:03.320]  So we're going to talk a little bit about Venezuela today.
[03:25:03.340 --> 03:25:06.222]  We're also going to talk about, as I pointed out, the Handmaid's Tale.
[03:25:06.883 --> 03:25:09.305]  This is a story that was released by Hulu.
[03:25:09.325 --> 03:25:10.566]  They refilmed this.
[03:25:10.746 --> 03:25:13.888]  My wife was in the 1990 version as a extra.
[03:25:13.988 --> 03:25:14.969]  Very small part in it.
[03:25:15.589 --> 03:25:16.810]  Just crowd scenes and stuff.
[03:25:16.870 --> 03:25:19.932]  And of course, they treated her pretty poorly.
[03:25:20.592 --> 03:25:22.354]  I don't think she went back after the first day.
[03:25:22.454 --> 03:25:26.156]  And she was horrified, horrified to find out what this movie was about.
[03:25:26.216 --> 03:25:27.617]  She didn't know anything about this.
[03:25:27.697 --> 03:25:28.938]  It's kind of like having
[03:25:30.319 --> 03:25:34.281]  Phyllis Schlafly finding out that she was an extra in Warren Beatty's Reds.
[03:25:34.781 --> 03:25:38.944]  My wife is so adamantly opposed to everything and all these lies in The Handmaid's Tale.
[03:25:38.964 --> 03:25:43.646]  So we're going to talk about The Handmaid's Burka, because that's really what this is truly about.
[03:25:44.046 --> 03:25:48.389]  It is everything that they're saying in The Handmaid's Tale, this dystopia that's there.
[03:25:48.989 --> 03:25:53.832]  It is far worse than that now in Saudi Arabia, but they cannot bring themselves to say that.
[03:25:54.392 --> 03:25:56.634]  It is simply about the evil of America.
[03:25:56.974 --> 03:25:58.595]  The evil of American patriarchy.
[03:25:58.895 --> 03:26:00.636]  The evil of American Christianity.
[03:26:01.297 --> 03:26:02.898]  That's what this tale is about.
[03:26:02.918 --> 03:26:10.543]  And we're going to show you an op-ed piece from someone who is writing for Salon, who talks about how she punked her class.
[03:26:11.223 --> 03:26:14.605]  And how it was so necessary to study this.
[03:26:14.646 --> 03:26:17.567]  How she did a fake book banning in her class.
[03:26:17.648 --> 03:26:19.749]  But, you know, this is what this is all about.
[03:26:19.989 --> 03:26:23.991]  Let's go back to our callers here and let's try to get this board cleared off the people that have been waiting here.
[03:26:24.011 --> 03:26:25.691]  Let's go to Jeff in Arizona.
[03:26:25.711 --> 03:26:26.212]  Jeff, go ahead.
[03:26:28.432 --> 03:26:28.713]  David?
[03:26:29.053 --> 03:26:29.713]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:26:30.573 --> 03:26:30.753]  Hey.
[03:26:32.954 --> 03:26:36.616]  Listen, I've been a long-time listener to your show.
[03:26:37.236 --> 03:26:41.378]  I've been paying attention to everything Alex has been saying ever since the Obama deception came out.
[03:26:41.758 --> 03:26:42.898]  It's been very eye-opening.
[03:26:43.559 --> 03:26:48.080]  And I know Alex constantly says things like, you know, don't bank me.
[03:26:50.670 --> 03:26:52.331]  I wanted to thank all the hard work you guys do.
[03:26:53.012 --> 03:26:59.719]  Anyway, I just wanted to say that this whole thing with Julian Assange, I'm very confused by it.
[03:27:00.139 --> 03:27:02.321]  Trump seems to be on top of a lot of things.
[03:27:04.203 --> 03:27:06.586]  A lot of domestic things to protect our country, but
[03:27:09.059 --> 03:27:20.643]  Well I think if you look at what's going on with this, and of course we've got an article up on InfoWars about it, talking about how this Vault 7, for example, severely embarrassed the CIA.
[03:27:21.444 --> 03:27:25.345]  And so I think that that's really what's behind this.
[03:27:25.405 --> 03:27:32.308]  And of course it's the bureaucracy there, the CIA is coming after him as well, and so it's
[03:27:33.488 --> 03:27:35.489]  Something that we need to speak out about.
[03:27:35.609 --> 03:27:44.511]  I don't think that we need to say now that Julian Assange is a bad guy, but of course Trump during the campaign was saying that Ed Snowden was a traitor.
[03:27:44.631 --> 03:27:47.571]  I don't think Ed Snowden was a traitor, but certainly WikiLeaks is not.
[03:27:47.671 --> 03:27:51.552]  What WikiLeaks has done is revealed true information about what was going on.
[03:27:51.592 --> 03:28:01.495]  Information that quite frankly was very helpful to Donald Trump, was very helpful to the cause that now CIA Director Pompeo is saying he doesn't
[03:28:02.455 --> 03:28:07.637]  Like Julian Assange wants to come after him, but of course he was applauding Julian Assange when he released this information.
[03:28:07.677 --> 03:28:13.639]  And I think if we look at Vault 7, I've had people say that Vault 7 is not classified.
[03:28:13.940 --> 03:28:24.304]  These hacks that they use to exploit into and to violate your privacy, that it's not classified because if it were, they would be guilty of distributing classified documents.
[03:28:24.344 --> 03:28:25.664]  So they would have some liability there.
[03:28:25.904 --> 03:28:28.105]  Also not copyrighted because they want to keep it secret.
[03:28:28.445 --> 03:28:29.466]  So it creates a very
[03:28:30.186 --> 03:28:34.369]  Difficult situation for them, that they don't want to address directly.
[03:28:34.809 --> 03:28:39.231]  So they're going to engage in underhanded techniques to try to do something about this.
[03:28:39.311 --> 03:28:40.112]  I don't approve of it.
[03:28:40.232 --> 03:28:46.916]  I think that Julian Assange has done a great favor to the world, to democracy here in America.
[03:28:47.476 --> 03:28:51.038]  I don't think that those DNC documents were even hacked into.
[03:28:51.098 --> 03:28:57.041]  That's a lie I think that was promulgated by people who were contractors to the DNC.
[03:28:57.101 --> 03:29:08.827]  WikiLeaks and a UK ambassador said, hey I traveled to the United States and was handed these documents in a park by somebody who was upset about the DNC and I gave these documents as a whistleblower inside the DNC.
[03:29:09.268 --> 03:29:09.728]  I gave these
[03:29:10.308 --> 03:29:16.775]  I've been told that he's a listener of your show, and like I said, I've been a longtime listener, but ever since the election is when I really
[03:29:33.329 --> 03:29:40.652]  Put my best focus and my best effort into paying attention to everything you guys have been saying, so please forgive my ignorance on a lot of issues.
[03:29:41.192 --> 03:29:47.134]  I love your show and all the hard work that everybody on your cast and crew does and everything that you guys are going through.
[03:29:47.735 --> 03:29:48.055]  Well, thanks.
[03:29:48.075 --> 03:29:48.755]  We're gonna work on it.
[03:29:48.855 --> 03:29:49.515]  We're gonna say it.
[03:29:49.655 --> 03:29:50.136]  And you know what?
[03:29:50.436 --> 03:29:52.757]  People need to make it clear to Donald Trump as well.
[03:29:52.797 --> 03:29:53.377]  We'll be right back.
[03:30:03.661 --> 03:30:16.233]  Although conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of showing up to her already-canceled speech at Berkeley, that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans from conducting a large First Amendment rally in its place.
[03:30:16.473 --> 03:30:24.601]  Prominent social media icons such as Gavin McInnes, Lauren Southern, Based Stickman, Baked Alaska, Brittany Pettibone, and Faith
[03:30:24.761 --> 03:30:28.745]  Goldie showed up to support free speech and gave speeches.
[03:30:29.006 --> 03:30:37.875]  Reports that the Berkeley police did their job in protecting the peace have come in, and apparently a total of six Antifa protesters were arrested.
[03:30:38.116 --> 03:30:43.622]  Two for resisting arrest, one for a drug violation, and another for possessing a weapon.
[03:30:43.962 --> 03:30:52.326]  Two more arrests were made earlier in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police.
[03:30:52.586 --> 03:30:58.428]  Despite these arrests, the protests remained peaceful and dialogue between both sides was present.
[03:30:58.648 --> 03:31:01.790]  This is Millie Weaver reporting to you for InfoWars.com.
[03:31:03.476 --> 03:31:11.267]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:11.467 --> 03:31:17.014]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:31:18.336 --> 03:31:32.482]  The secret to Defender body armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor, using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[03:31:32.542 --> 03:31:35.444]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:31:35.684 --> 03:31:41.486]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:31:41.786 --> 03:31:42.226]  It works.
[03:31:43.407 --> 03:31:44.287]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[03:31:44.307 --> 03:31:45.408]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:32:09.935 --> 03:32:10.295]  Great!
[03:32:10.395 --> 03:32:11.356]  Hey, thank you so much.
[03:32:11.496 --> 03:32:15.859]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[03:32:16.039 --> 03:32:17.580]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[03:32:17.720 --> 03:32:25.204]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[03:32:25.284 --> 03:32:26.145]  Wow, thank you.
[03:32:26.185 --> 03:32:28.446]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[03:32:28.526 --> 03:32:30.107]  Which super surgical do you like best?
[03:32:30.347 --> 03:32:33.629]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[03:32:33.649 --> 03:32:34.029]  That's amazing.
[03:32:34.089 --> 03:32:34.849]  That's really incredible.
[03:32:35.090 --> 03:32:38.131]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:32:38.151 --> 03:32:39.412]  Like, I haven't felt it in weeks.
[03:32:39.492 --> 03:32:41.093]  My morning was fantastic.
[03:32:41.173 --> 03:32:42.333]  And I love you guys.
[03:32:42.414 --> 03:32:43.854]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[03:32:44.575 --> 03:32:51.278]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[03:32:51.438 --> 03:32:52.219]  You will love it.
[03:32:52.479 --> 03:32:52.899]  I'm telling you.
[03:32:52.959 --> 03:32:54.300]  I've never bought a bad product.
[03:32:54.580 --> 03:32:58.981]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:32:59.021 --> 03:32:59.782]  It's a win-win.
[03:32:59.902 --> 03:33:00.942]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:33:11.105 --> 03:33:12.025]  You found it.
[03:33:12.345 --> 03:33:13.826]  The tip of the spear.
[03:33:14.386 --> 03:33:18.767]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[03:33:23.661 --> 03:33:25.042]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:25.062 --> 03:33:28.125]  On this fourth hour, Monday, Mayday!
[03:33:28.265 --> 03:33:28.745]  Mayday!
[03:33:29.005 --> 03:33:33.209]  It is a communist... They're trying to crash the economy.
[03:33:33.229 --> 03:33:34.950]  It is crashing and burning in Venezuela.
[03:33:34.970 --> 03:33:35.831]  We're going to talk about that.
[03:33:36.151 --> 03:33:41.715]  And I want to get to those stories, so we're going to just take three more callers who've been holding for 15 to 30 minutes here.
[03:33:42.296 --> 03:33:47.820]  And we're going to get Jason in Germany, Bubba in Virginia, Dan in Illinois, and then we're going to go to some news here.
[03:33:47.860 --> 03:33:51.463]  Before we go to even the callers, I just want to remind you that we still have Caveman.
[03:33:52.023 --> 03:33:55.805]  Our true paleo formula for 53% off at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:33:56.205 --> 03:33:57.766]  And again, that's not going to last forever.
[03:33:57.806 --> 03:33:58.646]  Take advantage of that.
[03:33:58.686 --> 03:34:03.348]  That's an additional 20% off of the deepest discount we've had on Caveman.
[03:34:03.688 --> 03:34:05.809]  So that's 53% off right now.
[03:34:05.869 --> 03:34:14.253]  It fuses super high-quality bone broth with more than seven different primal superfoods to help support healthy muscles, to fight free radicals, and so much more.
[03:34:14.873 --> 03:34:20.756]  It has things like turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and of course, bone broth, one of the key ingredients in that.
[03:34:21.296 --> 03:34:23.958]  See why hundreds of listeners have given Caveman five stars?
[03:34:23.998 --> 03:34:29.220]  You can go to InfoWarsStore.com and Caveman and all the other supplements that we sell there.
[03:34:29.260 --> 03:34:33.302]  You can take a look at what people give it in terms of reviews.

[03:34:36.164 --> 03:34:37.124]  We encourage you to do that.
[03:34:37.164 --> 03:34:39.625]  We're proud of the ingredients that we have in our products.

[03:35:00.455 --> 03:35:03.516]  And of course, we started that sale on Friday.
[03:35:04.097 --> 03:35:06.078]  That should be ending pretty soon, I imagine.
[03:35:06.518 --> 03:35:10.520]  Liver Shield, as we were talking to Dr. Group as he came in here, he was talking about how
[03:35:11.500 --> 03:35:12.301]  Essential it is.
[03:35:12.821 --> 03:35:19.764]  If you've got a situation like a fatty liver because you have a lot of high calorie, a lot of high sugar in your diet.
[03:35:20.225 --> 03:35:24.007]  It's a situation that creates a very bad health situation for you.
[03:35:24.067 --> 03:35:24.847]  But there is hope.
[03:35:24.887 --> 03:35:26.168]  You can change your diet.
[03:35:26.628 --> 03:35:36.510]  You can stop eating excessive sugar, you can stop eating some of the toxins, and then you can use something like LiverShield to help to get rid of those toxins.
[03:35:36.530 --> 03:35:38.090]  Your liver regenerates yourself.
[03:35:38.130 --> 03:35:46.272]  And if you use something like LiverShield and its blend of organic, wild-crafted herbs, you can help to support that natural regenerative function.
[03:35:46.312 --> 03:35:53.414]  You can help to support the detoxification of your liver and your gallbladder as you make those necessary changes in your life.
[03:35:53.454 --> 03:35:54.574]  Again, LiverShield, 30% off.
[03:35:55.754 --> 03:35:57.415]  At Infowarslife.com.
[03:35:57.455 --> 03:35:58.695]  Alright, let's go to our callers here.
[03:35:58.835 --> 03:35:59.896]  Jason in Germany.
[03:35:59.936 --> 03:36:00.516]  Go ahead, Jason.
[03:36:02.617 --> 03:36:03.797]  Hey David, good to be on this again.
[03:36:03.837 --> 03:36:06.078]  I'll try to get through my two little points real quick.
[03:36:06.719 --> 03:36:09.380]  First on the issue of fundraising and also supporting the InfoWar.
[03:36:10.160 --> 03:36:19.584]  I know that Alex and the InfoWar crew and your whole operation there is one of only a few media organizations or outfits that have the real big bullseye painted right on the back.
[03:36:20.324 --> 03:36:22.304]  Right on your back that everybody's going after.
[03:36:22.344 --> 03:36:28.526]  So, you know, I want you to succeed because if you guys succeed, then that helps the rest of us succeed.
[03:36:28.646 --> 03:36:31.046]  And, you know, it's like a circle.
[03:36:32.226 --> 03:36:33.787]  So I had a couple of ideas to help with that.
[03:36:33.907 --> 03:36:39.708]  I remember when Alex first brought up the issue of AdRoll kicking you guys off the revenue generation plan that you had.
[03:36:40.208 --> 03:36:45.829]  Was that centered around the health products that you guys advertise on other sites?
[03:36:46.557 --> 03:36:49.200]  On the ad roll, yes.
[03:36:49.360 --> 03:36:53.985]  With ad roll, they stopped our ads from being served on other sites.
[03:36:54.305 --> 03:37:01.993]  So just like with Breitbart, what they did was they shut down Breitbart accepting ads from other people because you go to the Breitbart site, you're looking at their articles.
[03:37:02.433 --> 03:37:05.735]  Ads get served there, so that website gets revenue.
[03:37:05.775 --> 03:37:07.016]  So Google stopped that.
[03:37:07.076 --> 03:37:12.680]  With us, we weren't depending on outside ads so much as we were serving our ads to other people.
[03:37:12.720 --> 03:37:15.761]  We had our own, and do have, our own separate site.
[03:37:15.862 --> 03:37:16.822]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:37:16.882 --> 03:37:17.783]  It is not political.
[03:37:18.323 --> 03:37:19.784]  It has no political content on it.
[03:37:19.824 --> 03:37:27.490]  There is no political content if you show people a bottle of iodine supplement or a bottle of vitamin B12 supplement.
[03:37:27.510 --> 03:37:33.215]  But they said, no, no, no, because that is associated with Infowars, we're going to shut that down.
[03:37:33.735 --> 03:37:36.878]  And that's what they have done to try to stop us from serving those ads.
[03:37:36.918 --> 03:37:37.939]  So that's one of the things they've done.
[03:37:37.959 --> 03:37:39.880]  Of course, lawsuits are very powerful, too.
[03:37:40.260 --> 03:37:46.986]  And if they can succeed in suing us and shutting us up, when we talk about rampant crony capitalism,
[03:37:47.446 --> 03:37:59.816]  When we talk about people coming into this country being put into the highest levels of power in this country because they are connected to the globalists at Davos, because they're connected to the Clintons, the Clinton Global Initiative.
[03:37:59.836 --> 03:38:00.717]  You know what they ought to do?
[03:38:01.197 --> 03:38:06.461]  The key ingredient of Chobani yogurt, one of the key ingredients is not listed on there, is crony capitalism.
[03:38:06.942 --> 03:38:07.882]  Taxpayer subsidies.
[03:38:08.183 --> 03:38:13.667]  Maybe that should be put on there in the name of honesty and truth and labeling so people really understand what's going on.
[03:38:14.067 --> 03:38:15.449]  And if we go to this lawsuit,
[03:38:16.189 --> 03:38:17.571]  Discovery is going to show that.
[03:38:17.691 --> 03:38:24.821]  That is going to be something we're going to tell people about the ingredients of your forced taxpayer subsidies on Chobani yogurt.
[03:38:24.901 --> 03:38:30.848]  How these people have leveraged all of this to get into the school lunch program and all these other issues.
[03:38:30.888 --> 03:38:32.290]  So it's a fight we're going to have.
[03:38:32.731 --> 03:38:33.412]  But it's expensive.
[03:38:34.949 --> 03:38:56.818]  So anyway, I had this idea back when Alex first raised the issue, and I just thought, I know that the billionaires and the big businesses have a million ways Sunday to protect themselves from the kinds of guilt by association attacks that Infowars Health has suffered from Google's side, and I thought, you know, I'm not an attorney obviously, so I thought maybe there's a way that Alex can
[03:38:57.578 --> 03:39:06.382]  Repackage the whole InfoWars Health part of the business into a completely separate business that would allow him to get that ad revenue back.
[03:39:06.762 --> 03:39:17.946]  And then in order for Google to cut you guys off, they would have to actually show a more overt legal reason why they could use the guilt by association thing, which I don't think would even work.
[03:39:17.986 --> 03:39:19.107]  Well, I tell you what they could do.
[03:39:19.147 --> 03:39:22.788]  I mean, we call the store InfoWars Store or whatever.
[03:39:22.948 --> 03:39:24.709]  Okay, so it's got InfoWars in the name.
[03:39:25.487 --> 03:39:32.612]  If we were to call it, you know, natural health subsidies or whatever, they would find a way to connect it with InfoWars.
[03:39:32.672 --> 03:39:35.934]  Once they learned that it was there, they would find some excuse to shut it down.
[03:39:35.954 --> 03:39:36.955]  I guarantee you.
[03:39:37.475 --> 03:39:45.540]  Because this isn't about the fact that people are concerned because they're seeing a bottle of caveman supplement there.
[03:39:46.121 --> 03:39:46.361]  Okay?
[03:39:46.381 --> 03:39:47.382]  That's not about that.
[03:39:47.822 --> 03:39:50.103]  So it is about coming after InfoWars.
[03:39:50.123 --> 03:39:52.465]  And they can come up with whatever kind of rationalization they want.
[03:39:52.625 --> 03:39:59.190]  They would, if we named it something else, it would take them a little bit of time to find it, but they would still do the same sort of thing.
[03:39:59.210 --> 03:40:03.993]  So I understand what you're saying, but it really is a focused, targeted attack.
[03:40:04.634 --> 03:40:12.639]  They find one individual within the news media, if you will, or they find a news organization, they isolate and attack that organization.
[03:40:12.700 --> 03:40:15.021]  Once they're successful, they go on to the next one.
[03:40:15.081 --> 03:40:17.923]  And we're seeing this throughout the press.
[03:40:18.043 --> 03:40:19.845]  I mean, you're seeing this with different
[03:40:20.345 --> 03:40:20.645]  Yes, David.
[03:40:47.511 --> 03:40:49.192]  I'm calling about President Trump.
[03:40:49.232 --> 03:40:50.312]  I think he's done a great job.
[03:40:50.332 --> 03:40:54.994]  I appreciate everything he's doing because, you know, in all reality, he doesn't need to be doing this.
[03:40:55.574 --> 03:40:57.535]  There's a thousand other things he could be doing other than this.
[03:40:57.595 --> 03:41:00.776]  He won't worry about putting himself and his family on the line.
[03:41:01.776 --> 03:41:06.117]  There's one thing, I know he listens, and I know that you and Alex talk to him.
[03:41:06.618 --> 03:41:16.521]  If there's one thing he could do, and he promised to do this the very first day whenever he was campaigning, is if he could do away with this insane, it's a DOD directive,
[03:41:16.977 --> 03:41:17.297]  Yeah.
[03:41:17.317 --> 03:41:17.478]  Yeah.
[03:41:29.807 --> 03:41:39.451]  You know, that'd be a great thing to bring out as an issue, and I wish we could get Trump... There's such a target-rich environment of things that need to be changed.
[03:41:39.571 --> 03:41:46.314]  I understand his difficulty, and I understand the fact that his biggest opposition is the Republican Party, the leadership in the Republican Party.
[03:41:46.394 --> 03:41:59.280]  We look at what happened with Obamacare, for example, and even as the House Freedom Caucus really gave up on the idea of repeal and just asked, well, couldn't we at least have like the 9th and 10th
[03:41:59.480 --> 03:41:59.840]  I think so.
[03:42:20.655 --> 03:42:21.696]  Wants Obamacare.
[03:42:21.957 --> 03:42:29.325]  But you're talking about that gun regulation that keeps people from being able to have firearms on military bases to protect themselves.
[03:42:29.365 --> 03:42:31.487]  Our soldiers who are trained on firearms.
[03:42:31.968 --> 03:42:34.470]  And that is something that Donald Trump has fallen back to.
[03:42:34.511 --> 03:42:38.955]  He did went to the NRA on the eve of the 100th anniversary.
[03:42:39.016 --> 03:42:40.017]  Or was it the day of the one?
[03:42:40.097 --> 03:42:41.118]  I think it was the day before.
[03:42:41.178 --> 03:42:41.959]  Anyway, he spoke there.
[03:42:43.248 --> 03:42:46.789]  And he understands that that is a key part of his core support.
[03:42:47.389 --> 03:42:48.630]  And so he made a pledge there.
[03:42:48.650 --> 03:43:00.033]  And as I talked about on Friday, there are still other tactics that are being put out there by the left to say, hey, if we even accuse you of a hate crime, even if it's a misdemeanor,
[03:43:00.913 --> 03:43:04.274]  If we say that you are hateful and even if you're not convicted, we're gonna take your gun.
[03:43:04.314 --> 03:43:08.955]  So they're still looking for different tactics to take people's Second Amendment rights.
[03:43:08.995 --> 03:43:11.315]  So it'd be great for Donald Trump to make that an issue.
[03:43:11.715 --> 03:43:14.216]  And on so many issues, he has done the right thing.
[03:43:14.256 --> 03:43:21.137]  My concern with Donald Trump has been that he needs to be careful and aware of who his friends and enemies are.
[03:43:21.477 --> 03:43:25.538]  And when we look at what happened with Obamacare, it was almost as if he thought that
[03:43:26.178 --> 03:43:27.380]  Paul Ryan was going to work with him.
[03:43:27.440 --> 03:43:31.286]  Paul Ryan is never going to work with him on Obamacare or on tax cuts.
[03:43:31.326 --> 03:43:32.728]  He's always going to work against him.
[03:43:33.109 --> 03:43:41.581]  And I was just disappointed to see the anger of Trump as this whole deal fell apart, which it was designed to do by Paul Ryan.
[03:43:42.162 --> 03:43:51.831]  I think when this whole thing fell apart, his attacks and his anger at the House Freedom Caucus was very ill-advised, very, very misdirected.
[03:43:52.212 --> 03:43:55.915]  And so he needs to really step back and understand who his friends are, who his enemies are.
[03:43:56.436 --> 03:44:04.364]  I know he's got a lot of opposition there with the establishment, and it's going to be a tough row to hoe, but he has to know who his friends and enemies are, and he needs to
[03:44:04.904 --> 03:44:12.426]  Perhaps get rid of some of these advisors, especially taking out his daughter and Jared Kushner because it's not going to be a good thing for the family members.
[03:44:12.906 --> 03:44:17.587]  Already there's a lot of talk about the corruption that you've heard us talk about with Jared Kushner.
[03:44:17.987 --> 03:44:20.528]  His enemies are going to hang that around his neck.
[03:44:20.988 --> 03:44:23.269]  So they're going to get hammered by this.
[03:44:23.729 --> 03:44:28.610]  They are not ideologically on the same page as Trump and Trump's base.
[03:44:29.250 --> 03:44:34.393]  And so it's going to damage his support with his base if they are able to influence policy.
[03:44:34.413 --> 03:44:37.134]  But there's going to be a big price for them to pay in politics.
[03:44:37.174 --> 03:44:48.660]  So they really should ask themselves if they want to be in this, if they want to take the people who are now behind them, the left, to think that they can use them to move the Trump administration.
[03:44:48.700 --> 03:44:49.481]  Maybe they can.
[03:44:50.427 --> 03:44:56.228]  But, you know, the other thing is that when the left gets behind you, understand that somebody has to get behind you before they can stick the knife in your back.
[03:44:56.268 --> 03:45:01.769]  And that's what's going to eventually happen in Washington with the left, with Jared and Ivanka.
[03:45:01.829 --> 03:45:06.570]  So they ought to get them out, get them back to working and doing their own business.
[03:45:06.831 --> 03:45:07.251]  Thank you, Bubba.
[03:45:07.271 --> 03:45:08.231]  I've got to go to Dan.
[03:45:08.251 --> 03:45:09.631]  Let's go to Dan in Illinois.
[03:45:09.651 --> 03:45:13.512]  David, how are you doing?
[03:45:14.429 --> 03:45:16.250]  I met you in D.C.
[03:45:16.330 --> 03:45:19.713]  at the train station with, uh... I remember!
[03:45:20.333 --> 03:45:20.993]  I remember!
[03:45:21.054 --> 03:45:21.714]  Okay, good.
[03:45:22.595 --> 03:45:32.861]  I also got to see, uh, Alex in Cleveland, and I disrupted, uh... What I really want to say is, uh, common law.
[03:45:33.402 --> 03:45:42.268]  If they ever drag, uh, Alex Jones back into court for custody, he needs to get, uh, Carl Lentz on his show.
[03:45:42.935 --> 03:45:42.995]  The
[03:45:59.339 --> 03:46:00.480]  Well, I understand.
[03:46:00.981 --> 03:46:13.793]  It's just, you know, the problem is, and I understand what the situation is and I understand what you're saying, but the problem is, is that we can't get people to agree on something as obvious as the First Amendment or the Second Amendment.
[03:46:13.954 --> 03:46:16.196]  As clear and as plain as those are.
[03:46:16.256 --> 03:46:22.362]  So when we get to the more obscure points of tax protesting or the more obscure points of Admiralty Law or whatever,
[03:46:23.062 --> 03:46:44.453]  If we can't get people to understand on the clear meaning of the Fourth Amendment or the First Amendment or the Second Amendment, if we can't get people to understand that civil asset forfeiture in no way can be supported by the Constitution, then we can't really explain these other, you know, things about what's happened to our legal system, what's happened to the government.
[03:46:44.493 --> 03:46:49.495]  And I understand that, you know, we don't have the Constitution anymore.
[03:46:49.875 --> 03:46:50.856]  I understand that fully.
[03:46:51.556 --> 03:46:58.380]  But I think we need to get people to understand, look, we don't have the Constitution because they're not giving people a trial and a conviction before they take their property.
[03:46:58.460 --> 03:47:02.723]  We don't have the Constitution because they're doing illegal searches of us without a search warrant.
[03:47:02.743 --> 03:47:05.964]  We don't have the Constitution because they're infringing on our Second Amendment rights.
[03:47:06.205 --> 03:47:13.049]  We don't have the Constitution because they're coming after our free exercise of our religious beliefs and our free speech.
[03:47:13.909 --> 03:47:19.610]  Once we get people to say, hey, you know, why is it that they take a note to the Constitution they don't obey?
[03:47:19.730 --> 03:47:21.611]  Then we can start talking about the other issues.
[03:47:21.671 --> 03:47:36.134]  But that's the bigger elephant in the room that we need to point out first and get people to understand that, no, the Constitution really is a dead letter, or as George W. Bush is reported to have said, it's just a damn piece of paper.
[03:47:36.735 --> 03:47:38.015]  When people understand that,
[03:47:38.795 --> 03:47:42.897]  Then we can start telling them how it got there and what we need to do to fix it.
[03:47:42.937 --> 03:47:46.579]  But first they have to understand what the problem is and they have to care what the problem is.
[03:47:46.819 --> 03:47:47.279]  Thanks, Dan.
[03:47:47.339 --> 03:47:52.082]  I want to get to May Day and I want to get to Venezuela, which is a perfect example.
[03:47:53.255 --> 03:47:57.359]  I think it was CNN that said how paradise was lost.
[03:47:57.919 --> 03:48:03.223]  Because you see, the mainstream media thinks that socialism is a utopian paradise.
[03:48:03.543 --> 03:48:09.028]  They think it can still succeed no matter how many times in this last century it has failed.
[03:48:09.048 --> 03:48:21.038]  And I think it's interesting as we come in on the 100th anniversary of communism, the great failed experiment of communism, there were two revolutions in 1917 in Russia that ushered that in.
[03:48:21.698 --> 03:48:23.259]  And of course they weren't on May Day.
[03:48:23.999 --> 03:48:25.479]  And Alex touched on this earlier.
[03:48:25.559 --> 03:48:27.440]  Why would they pick May Day to celebrate?
[03:48:27.480 --> 03:48:32.942]  Well, because May Day was always a pagan, satanic holiday.
[03:48:33.002 --> 03:48:35.623]  So there's part of the connection that gets there.
[03:48:35.663 --> 03:48:48.588]  I think when we look at NPR talking about May Day celebrations around the world, you know, where you set police on fire and things like that in Paris, they also talk about the fact that it is a celebration of workers and immigrants.
[03:48:49.568 --> 03:48:52.451]  Because that's where they see the future coming.
[03:48:52.832 --> 03:48:55.195]  That's their fifth column that they want to bring into the country.
[03:48:55.255 --> 03:49:05.086]  So when we look at the pictures of, we look at this NPR thing, we got a babushka lady in Russia holding a picture of her beloved Joseph Stalin.
[03:49:05.526 --> 03:49:06.287]  And nostalgia.
[03:49:07.088 --> 03:49:31.174]  Papa Stalin, okay, and I guess I don't know if that lady is Warren Beatty's sister I think she's a little bit younger than that maybe or a little bit better makeup Maybe had some more plastic surgery, but you know it's about the age that Warren Beatty's sister would be but anyway as they talk about protesters in Paris just you know happen to throw Gasoline bombs and setting the police on fire seriously burning them and so forth and then of course there's
[03:49:32.526 --> 03:49:47.153]  There's the nostalgia in Moscow, but it's really Venezuela, Venezuela that I want to focus on because even though they're having protests all over the US and of course now they're focusing on immigration, I really want to talk about Venezuela.
[03:49:48.073 --> 03:49:49.534]  And if we look at Venezuela,
[03:49:50.754 --> 03:49:54.677]  And we have the CNN story, How Paradise Got Lost.
[03:49:54.797 --> 03:49:55.858]  That's their headline.
[03:49:56.999 --> 03:49:59.021]  And what do we see in Venezuela?
[03:49:59.181 --> 03:50:00.922]  Well, we see plummeting oil prices.
[03:50:01.423 --> 03:50:03.605]  We see the flow of dollars slowed to a trickle.
[03:50:03.625 --> 03:50:06.987]  We see children dying in hospitals because they can't get medicine.
[03:50:07.147 --> 03:50:08.068]  They can't even get food.
[03:50:08.108 --> 03:50:09.930]  They've got to go into Brazil to get medicine.
[03:50:10.510 --> 03:50:15.616]  See, this is where we're going to go, and we need to make this point clearly understood.
[03:50:16.297 --> 03:50:26.930]  Because when I hear the Republican Party and President Trump talking about Obamacare, President Trump is still focused on universal coverage.
[03:50:27.611 --> 03:50:36.335]  If you're going to focus on universal coverage, we're going to continue to have socialism and fascism, that unique blend that Obamacare is a great example of.
[03:50:36.876 --> 03:50:40.958]  And we're going to continue to lose health care, just as the Venezuelans have done.
[03:50:41.538 --> 03:50:49.842]  You can't vote yourself a 60% increase in minimum wage and then think that you're better off when you've got absolutely no money.
[03:50:49.902 --> 03:50:51.523]  When we come back, we're going to talk about that.
[03:50:51.763 --> 03:50:57.066]  And I want to cover an article that the New York Times had, a recollection by a writer named Vivian Gornick.
[03:50:57.586 --> 03:51:01.228]  Talking about how she grew up in New York in a communist family and how she learned what it was about.
[03:51:01.268 --> 03:51:02.068]  Stay with us, we'll be back.
[03:51:03.369 --> 03:51:05.129]  You provided, Alex, with the caveman?
[03:51:05.149 --> 03:51:07.210]  Well, so we've been formulating this stuff for a while.
[03:51:07.270 --> 03:51:10.592]  We've been getting these different flavors and, you know, I don't know about this one.
[03:51:11.052 --> 03:51:14.033]  You know, and so I've been taking that stuff and I'm an old man.
[03:51:14.053 --> 03:51:14.654]  I'm 42.
[03:51:14.694 --> 03:51:17.575]  I work out five times a week, if not more.
[03:51:17.755 --> 03:51:19.216]  I hear you're okay in jiu-jitsu.
[03:51:21.636 --> 03:51:22.277]  No, I'm not.
[03:51:22.337 --> 03:51:22.977]  I'm terrible.
[03:51:22.997 --> 03:51:23.557]  I'm terrible.
[03:51:23.657 --> 03:51:30.799]  But, the point is, is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and, you know, this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[03:51:31.399 --> 03:51:38.621]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula, has just worked magic for me.
[03:51:38.661 --> 03:51:42.122]  And that's just, you know, that's just from my personal experience.
[03:51:43.522 --> 03:51:48.767]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[03:51:48.807 --> 03:51:51.890]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[03:51:52.290 --> 03:51:53.571]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[03:51:53.591 --> 03:51:55.152]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[03:51:55.233 --> 03:51:56.374]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[03:51:56.394 --> 03:52:03.580]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[03:52:04.000 --> 03:52:06.101]  Yeah.
[03:52:06.121 --> 03:52:11.764]  But the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[03:52:11.824 --> 03:52:13.525]  I felt it immediately.
[03:52:13.765 --> 03:52:15.766]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[03:52:15.846 --> 03:52:18.928]  Like, I'm really picky and I will drink it.
[03:52:18.948 --> 03:52:20.089]  It tastes good to me.
[03:52:20.189 --> 03:52:24.131]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[03:52:24.171 --> 03:52:26.312]  So, I mean, if the bone broth
[03:52:30.054 --> 03:52:35.198]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[03:52:35.218 --> 03:52:38.961]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[03:52:39.001 --> 03:52:46.766]  So ladies, get yourself some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[03:52:46.826 --> 03:52:50.169]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my own thing.
[03:52:50.209 --> 03:52:51.990]  Maybe get it for your wife then too, or girlfriend.
[03:52:52.730 --> 03:52:58.715]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[03:52:58.735 --> 03:53:00.316]  No fear, nothing, so.
[03:53:00.984 --> 03:53:08.325]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[03:53:08.885 --> 03:53:10.686]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[03:53:11.406 --> 03:53:21.948]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us, either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[03:53:22.008 --> 03:53:23.248]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[03:53:23.288 --> 03:53:29.409]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[03:53:30.669 --> 03:53:32.910]  A borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[03:53:32.950 --> 03:53:35.151]  This is all money that's come from you, the listeners.
[03:53:35.171 --> 03:53:43.255]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[03:53:43.275 --> 03:53:46.616]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[03:53:46.656 --> 03:53:49.497]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[03:53:49.597 --> 03:53:54.640]  So once again, we got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us.
[03:53:55.680 --> 03:54:02.563]  Even when we make mistakes, and even when we're not right, and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us and I appreciate that.
[03:54:08.126 --> 03:54:15.970]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:16.030 --> 03:54:16.510]  I'm David Knight.
[03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:20.752]  In this last segment, I'm not going to have time to talk about the Handmaid's Burka.
[03:54:21.400 --> 03:54:23.643]  You'll have to tune in to the InfoWars Nightly News tonight.
[03:54:23.683 --> 03:54:24.665]  We'll cover that tonight.
[03:54:25.166 --> 03:54:32.176]  There's not enough time for that because I want to finish up where we are on Venezuela and the fruit of socialism, where it always heads off.
[03:54:32.477 --> 03:54:36.543]  Before we do, real quickly, I just want to remind you of the specials that we've got at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:37.123 --> 03:54:41.248]  30% off Survival Seed Vault.
[03:54:41.729 --> 03:54:43.310]  30% off Survival Seeds.
[03:54:43.611 --> 03:54:48.196]  We also have 15% off Super Blue free toothpaste, which is now back in stock.
[03:54:48.236 --> 03:54:49.397]  It's been out of stock for a while.
[03:54:49.677 --> 03:54:50.118]  Sold out.
[03:54:50.378 --> 03:54:51.660]  Very good formulation.
[03:54:51.700 --> 03:54:52.461]  If you try that,
[03:54:52.901 --> 03:54:55.062]  You'll understand why it sells out so quickly.
[03:54:55.323 --> 03:54:58.765]  It's now back in stock and 15% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:58.785 --> 03:55:06.009]  That super blue fluoride-free toothpaste that has iodine and nano silver in it and it does not have fluoride.
[03:55:06.089 --> 03:55:08.611]  So it's what it doesn't have and what it does have.
[03:55:08.651 --> 03:55:10.172]  It is a great toothpaste.
[03:55:10.512 --> 03:55:14.614]  Also, Liver Shield 30% off and Caveman still at 53% off.
[03:55:14.634 --> 03:55:14.915]  That's our
[03:55:17.256 --> 03:55:24.666]  Formulation, bone broth, and more than seven different primal superfoods that you can put together in a chocolate-flavored drink mix.
[03:55:24.686 --> 03:55:25.828]  You can make a smoothie out of it.
[03:55:25.888 --> 03:55:30.094]  It's a great way to get primal superfood nutrients.
[03:55:30.154 --> 03:55:31.115]  That's Caveman at 53% off.
[03:55:33.407 --> 03:55:36.692]  Let's go to this article here from Al Jazeera.
[03:55:36.712 --> 03:55:40.257]  CNN says, hey, paradise has been lost in Venezuela.
[03:55:40.318 --> 03:55:40.858]  What happened?
[03:55:40.898 --> 03:55:42.421]  All these different metrics that we have here.
[03:55:42.922 --> 03:55:46.827]  And as Al Jazeera points out, they have the world's biggest known oil reserves.
[03:55:47.088 --> 03:55:47.809]  So you'd think
[03:55:48.590 --> 03:55:50.410]  That they would be doing much better, wouldn't you?
[03:55:50.610 --> 03:55:55.932]  And yet they have the poorest performer in terms of GDP growth per capita.
[03:55:55.952 --> 03:56:00.753]  Let's give you some of the other metrics out of Venezuela, the place that has the world's biggest oil reserves.
[03:56:01.353 --> 03:56:07.354]  They have $10.4 billion in foreign reserves left, yet they have a debt of $7.2 billion.
[03:56:07.974 --> 03:56:11.415]  The IMF says that they've had a negative growth rate of minus 8%.
[03:56:13.171 --> 03:56:14.812]  And they've had inflation of 481%.
[03:56:15.072 --> 03:56:22.576]  An unemployment rate of 17% that is expected to go to 20% this year.
[03:56:23.056 --> 03:56:24.057]  So everything is failing.
[03:56:24.077 --> 03:56:24.657]  So what do you do?
[03:56:24.977 --> 03:56:28.119]  Well, if you're a communist, you vote yourself a raise.
[03:56:28.939 --> 03:56:32.301]  So they've increased the minimum wage by 60%.
[03:56:32.361 --> 03:56:34.342]  Okay, there you go.
[03:56:34.582 --> 03:56:35.963]  That solves it all, doesn't it?
[03:56:36.723 --> 03:56:40.165]  And you tell everybody that you've got universal health care and universal
[03:56:41.155 --> 03:56:42.316]  We have to understand.
[03:56:54.349 --> 03:57:03.231]  That a competitive marketplace, even though there is no perfect system, a competitive marketplace is going to be the only thing that is going to increase access to health care.
[03:57:03.831 --> 03:57:09.633]  The only thing that is going to make health care more affordable are going to be markets, not mandates.
[03:57:10.333 --> 03:57:12.033]  Choices, not coercion.
[03:57:12.753 --> 03:57:18.895]  We don't want to fall into this trap of measuring this in terms of how many people have insurance coverage.
[03:57:19.015 --> 03:57:21.055]  That's not the metric we want to focus on.
[03:57:21.495 --> 03:57:23.756]  If Donald Trump focuses on that metric,
[03:57:24.588 --> 03:57:25.188]  We will lose.
[03:57:26.229 --> 03:57:27.650]  And we may have already lost.
[03:57:27.870 --> 03:57:28.190]  I don't know.
[03:57:28.210 --> 03:57:28.790]  We'll have to see.
[03:57:28.830 --> 03:57:31.311]  But we have to get onto a market system.
[03:57:31.471 --> 03:57:32.272]  That's what he ran on.
[03:57:32.752 --> 03:57:38.795]  He had a great plan on his campaign website, which by the way is gone, but you can always find it in the Wayback Machine.
[03:57:39.035 --> 03:57:42.057]  Let's take a look at the recollection of Vivian Gornick.
[03:57:43.010 --> 03:57:46.633]  And she writes on the New York Times, when communism inspired America.
[03:57:46.653 --> 03:57:49.736]  She talks about the fact that she grew up in the late 40s, early 50s.
[03:57:50.136 --> 03:57:52.378]  Her parents were working class socialists in New York.
[03:57:53.199 --> 03:57:57.022]  All of their friends called themselves, quote-unquote, progressives, okay?
[03:57:57.483 --> 03:58:02.627]  But what she found was that one day, she became very disillusioned.
[03:58:03.408 --> 03:58:05.249]  They saw what happened with Stalin.
[03:58:05.649 --> 03:58:16.473]  And as the revelations came out of the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, and revealed to the world the horror of Stalin's rule, her family was speechless.
[03:58:17.293 --> 03:58:22.395]  She cried out, lies, lies, treachery, murder, all in the name of socialism, in the name of socialism.
[03:58:22.455 --> 03:58:25.336]  And her parents said, wait, this can't be true.
[03:58:25.936 --> 03:58:27.216]  The truth will eventually come out.
[03:58:27.596 --> 03:58:29.117]  Yeah, it's far worse than that.
[03:58:29.657 --> 03:58:31.880]  And we can see what's going on in Venezuela as well.
[03:58:32.420 --> 03:58:37.626]  Join us for 3 to 5 live and for the InfoWars Nightly News tonight at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:37.666 --> 03:58:37.966]  Eastern.
[03:58:45.034 --> 03:58:48.998]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.320 --> 03:59:05.892]  Although conservative commentator Ann Coulter backed out of showing up to her already-canceled speech at Berkeley, that didn't stop freedom-loving Americans from conducting a large First Amendment rally in its place.
[03:59:06.132 --> 03:59:14.880]  Prominent social media icons such as Gavin McInnes, Lauren Southern, Based Stickman, Baked Alaska, Brittany Pettibone, and Faith Goldie
[03:59:15.180 --> 03:59:18.424]  ...showed up to support free speech and gave speeches.
[03:59:18.664 --> 03:59:27.534]  Reports that the Berkeley police did their job in protecting the peace have come in, and apparently a total of six Antifa protesters were arrested.
[03:59:27.774 --> 03:59:33.281]  Two for resisting arrest, one for a drug violation, and another for possessing a weapon.
[03:59:33.621 --> 03:59:42.010]  Two more arrests were made earlier in the day for possession of a knife and obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police.
[03:59:42.251 --> 03:59:48.117]  Despite these arrests, the protests remained peaceful and dialogue between both sides was present.
[03:59:48.317 --> 03:59:51.581]  This is Millie Weaver reporting to you for InfoWars.com.
[03:59:54.284 --> 03:59:59.570]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
