[00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.650]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.751]  It is Friday, the 24th of February, 2017.
[00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:26.473]  I'm Leanne McAdoo, and here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.374 --> 00:00:40.579]  Tonight, President Trump's war against fake news continues as he delivers another powerful speech, this time at CPAC.
[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.962]  You know, the dishonest media, they'll say, he didn't get a standing ovation.
[00:00:45.002 --> 00:00:45.462]  You know why?
[00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:47.111]  No, you know why?
[00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:50.392]  Because everybody stood and nobody sat.
[00:00:50.452 --> 00:00:53.192]  So they will say he never got a standing ovation.
[00:00:54.572 --> 00:01:04.254]  Meanwhile, the mainstream media wants you to believe that Trump supporters were caught red-handed waving Russian flags during the event.
[00:01:05.294 --> 00:01:08.315]  And look who's joining the Washington Post.
[00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:11.375]  Is that John Podesta?
[00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:14.896]  No anchovies, please.
[00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:20.953]  All that plus much more up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.913 --> 00:03:10.497]  Well, we've been hearing a lot about fake news that's pushing an agenda, but what about fake data?
[00:03:10.777 --> 00:03:15.260]  Now, I am talking about government-funded research on your dime.
[00:03:15.541 --> 00:03:29.652]  To the tune of about $7 billion a year, there are actually taxpayer-funded scientists faking the data, and the feds say they don't really want to speculate about how many of those are fraudulent.
[00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:33.273]  So these are scientists faking their government-funded research.
[00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:34.574]  They're defrauding taxpayers.
[00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:38.175]  And this, of course, is drastically increasing in number.
[00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:45.978]  The National Science Foundation funds research projects to the tune of about $7 billion a year in taxpayer funds.
[00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:50.140]  Officials there won't estimate how much goes to cheaters.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.321]  Who manipulate data, they plagiarize and they steal public money.
[00:03:54.601 --> 00:04:01.003]  When asked about it, a spokesman said, we don't generally speculate about how much misconduct is undetected.
[00:04:01.864 --> 00:04:14.068]  So just in the last two years, they've closed 74 investigations, catching researchers plagiarizing, manipulating data, stealing, wasting government money, committing other fraud.
[00:04:14.108 --> 00:04:18.049]  They use it for expenses to pay their cell phone bill or to pay for their apartment.
[00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.510]  And this is according to the inspector general of that agency, their internal watchdog.
[00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:32.152]  And the case includes researchers who falsified data, plagiarized other people's work, spent money on these personal expenses.
[00:04:32.492 --> 00:04:37.353]  So this is data that we are told every single day, oh, well, it's government funded research.
[00:04:37.373 --> 00:04:42.894]  And I'm sure that these are going to be on vaccine safety or big pharma safety.
[00:04:43.354 --> 00:04:47.495]  Of course, there was that whole government funded research into why
[00:04:48.806 --> 00:04:49.807]  Lesbians are fat!
[00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:51.828]  That was on your tax dime as well.
[00:04:52.028 --> 00:05:01.393]  But, you know, that's the kind of thing that we are paying for with our tax dollars and they are not even investigating into how much of that is fraudulent.
[00:05:01.694 --> 00:05:08.538]  And yet we're being told again and again that we just need to trust the scientists, trust the research that's coming out.
[00:05:09.258 --> 00:05:17.886]  And of course, the fact that we now know that they are plagiarizing, falsifying data in order to push an agenda or to continue receiving those government funds.
[00:05:18.286 --> 00:05:21.710]  This is just harming the public's trust even further.
[00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.832]  Now, research, this is research misconduct.
[00:05:24.892 --> 00:05:31.278]  It damages not only the scientific enterprise, of course, but it's a misuse of public funds.
[00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:34.822]  Despite the fact that they know that a lot of this is going on,
[00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:42.946]  Researchers can typically start collecting funds again after just a few years after they've gotten caught defrauding taxpayers.
[00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:47.949]  So this is absolutely crazy and this is where you see the government bloat.
[00:05:47.969 --> 00:06:00.796]  So they have zero accountability, it's not their money, and they don't know how much research has actually been falsified to further an agenda, which means we could still be dealing with fake data that is out there.
[00:06:01.676 --> 00:06:15.039]  And, you know, they might not know because the inspector general says that they don't really like to speculate because, of course, if we can't trust the data, then we can't go ahead and get those carbon taxes on, you know, falsified data.
[00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:19.140]  They don't want you to know that we don't necessarily need to trust everything the government says.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.701]  Now, getting back to the fake news.
[00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:41.619]  The media, of course, was putting out this big story that at CPAC, numerous journalists actually were talking about President Trump's supporters were seen waving Russian flags before his CPAC speech, completely omitting the fact that the entire incident was a stunt pulled by an anti-Trump leftist group.
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.124]  Snapchat's Peter Hamby tweeted out it received over 9,000 retweets at the time of print.
[00:06:47.805 --> 00:06:51.767]  That the crowd was waving these flags, look exactly like the Russian flag.
[00:06:52.207 --> 00:06:54.488]  Staffers quickly came around to confiscate them.
[00:06:54.888 --> 00:07:01.150]  James O'Keefe tweeted back, Hey, this was Ryan Clayton from Bob Creamer's group, Americans Take Action.
[00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:02.991]  He was forcibly removed.
[00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:04.632]  You edited that part out.
[00:07:05.172 --> 00:07:11.775]  Americans Take Action is a far left organization who openly their stated mission is to have Trump impeached.
[00:07:12.395 --> 00:07:20.941]  So the mainstream media, AOL, Yahoo News, all these other organizations that were there completely omit the fact that this was a stunt by leftists.
[00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:24.964]  They just put it out there as Trump supporters are just willingly waving these Russian flags.
[00:07:25.025 --> 00:07:25.945]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:37.074]  So this could possibly be why we are seeing now CNN, New York Times, Politico, the Los Angeles Times, BuzzFeed being excluded from a press briefing.
[00:07:37.754 --> 00:07:43.538]  Now, this one is less formal than the televised Q&A session at the White House briefing room.
[00:07:44.258 --> 00:07:49.562]  But the pool will usually include one representative from a television network and one print outlet.
[00:07:50.062 --> 00:07:55.806]  In this case, four of the five major networks, NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox, were allowed in.
[00:07:56.226 --> 00:07:57.647]  CNN was blocked.
[00:07:58.108 --> 00:08:03.571]  And then he also allowed in Breitbart News, Washington Times and One American News Network.
[00:08:04.012 --> 00:08:07.414]  So these are more conservative media organizations that are being allowed in.
[00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:16.100]  And CNN and New York Times, they protested this decision and they said, this is unacceptable development by the Trump White House.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:22.984]  Apparently, this is how they retaliate when you report facts they don't like, also known as very fake news.
[00:08:23.324 --> 00:08:29.629]  And so, of course, they're very upset because they can't get in and be the first ones to spin a story wildly out of control.
[00:08:30.089 --> 00:08:37.534]  Now, we know that they go on to say free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest.
[00:08:38.074 --> 00:08:41.657]  Meanwhile, they leave out the fact that they are not free media whatsoever.
[00:08:41.737 --> 00:08:43.279]  They are corporate owned.
[00:08:43.699 --> 00:08:47.042]  They have massive corporate interests in their stakeholders.
[00:08:47.122 --> 00:08:50.665]  Washington Post is like the CIA's go-to outlet.
[00:08:50.725 --> 00:08:58.772]  New York Times is owned majorly by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, totally biased against Donald Trump.
[00:08:59.232 --> 00:09:00.513]  They are not a free press.
[00:09:01.474 --> 00:09:09.817]  And of course, you know, if they were, then they would have been saying all this against the least transparent administration ever, the outgoing Obama administration.
[00:09:10.137 --> 00:09:19.880]  But they completely ignored that because they wanted to, you know, rub elbows with His Majesty, His Greatness, His Holiness, President, former President Barack Obama.
[00:09:20.737 --> 00:09:48.097]  Now, we know that Project Veritas leaked audio from the secretly recorded CNN tapes, and they announced that they were going to be dropping these WikiLeaks-style, 119 hours of it were released, and the investigative journalists there that actually dropped these audio tapes said they've only gone through a fraction of the tapes, they need the help from the public to better interpret them, there's just so much of this footage, but within hours of this dropping,
[00:09:48.937 --> 00:09:50.899]  So here O'Keefe has been sitting on this.
[00:09:50.959 --> 00:09:52.560]  They haven't even had time to go through it.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:10:01.308]  But that did not stop the mainstream media from immediately proclaiming that there was nothing to see here, nothing to investigate, nothing juicy.
[00:10:01.668 --> 00:10:04.010]  How they were able to go through all this, I am unsure.
[00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.533]  But what's interesting is that just about the exact same time
[00:10:08.033 --> 00:10:21.077]  And with the exact same tone, a lot of publications were saying this exact same thing, Politico, Washington Post, New York Daily News, and others, that there's nothing to see here folks, move along, nothing juicy, no news.
[00:10:21.137 --> 00:10:36.943]  Now of course we've got some writers that are actually going through those CNN tapes and they say that because it's from 2009, everyone should just move on, nothing to see here, because obviously there's not going to be anything that has to deal with the current, this most recent presidential election.
[00:10:37.563 --> 00:10:38.084]  I don't think so.
[00:10:55.524 --> 00:11:01.067]  This was the Trump tape where he was bragging about grabbing women by the hoo-ha.
[00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:11.332]  It was leaked by an NBC News staffer, and apparently they thought, you know, they were upset that it was taking Access Hollywood too long to put this thing out, so they went ahead and leaked it.
[00:11:11.692 --> 00:11:13.093]  But it served a dual purpose.
[00:11:13.173 --> 00:11:18.515]  It helped get Bush out of the way because Matt Lauer didn't like him and felt he was a liability.
[00:11:18.615 --> 00:11:23.398]  So, didn't really end up hurting Donald Trump, but it did end up hurting Billy Bush.
[00:11:24.258 --> 00:11:25.779]  But the leaking continues.
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:38.090]  So the CIA's favorite go-to publication when they want to leak stuff, the Washington Post, they received a memo that was specifically about protecting privileged information.
[00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.732]  The State Department wrote this anti-leak memo.
[00:11:41.213 --> 00:11:43.895]  It was promptly leaked to the Washington Post.
[00:11:44.335 --> 00:11:53.918]  It was a four-page memo from Secretary of State Tex Tillerson's warning of the dangers of leaking by State Department employees.
[00:11:54.278 --> 00:11:59.580]  It promptly leaked to Josh Rogin, the writer there at the Washington Post.
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:09.867]  So this is just kind of showing you the relationship between the Trump administration's political appointees and the State Department's professional workforce who has been in place for years.
[00:12:10.387 --> 00:12:18.372]  Obviously, they don't have a very good relationship because there's a memo that says we need to protect and stop the leaks and they immediately leak it to the Washington Post.
[00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:21.054]  It was sensitive but unclassified.
[00:12:21.114 --> 00:12:23.836]  So, you know, not technically illegal, I guess.
[00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:27.218]  But, you know, they wonder why they're having such an issue.
[00:12:27.238 --> 00:12:29.500]  The State Department's already
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:35.224]  Excluding detailed readouts of meetings with foreign officials.
[00:12:35.544 --> 00:12:47.313]  They've shortened the list of officials who are allowed inside the 915 senior staff meeting and they have face-to-face conversations rather than email anything because look at what President Trump is dealing with in his administration.
[00:12:47.393 --> 00:12:52.277]  He is dealing with rogue employees who want to see him fall
[00:12:53.758 --> 00:13:07.132]  And, um, you know, I'm going to skip ahead a couple articles here because I want to get to not only look, not only is the Trump administration having to deal with a lot of rogue employees that have been there since Obama and they wanted to see that super progressive agenda being pushed.
[00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:21.924]  And not only is he dealing with a communist and Antifa groups and these little fascist groups that are constantly SJWs protesting him, now Donald Trump and his supporters are having to deal with witches.
[00:13:22.505 --> 00:13:23.085]  That is right.
[00:13:23.165 --> 00:13:30.308]  Tonight at the stroke of midnight, witches around the globe are going to cast a spell on President Trump.
[00:13:31.088 --> 00:13:32.569]  And his supporters.
[00:13:32.789 --> 00:13:34.490]  This was actually real news.
[00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:46.638]  Now I took the one off the Daily Mail because they always have a funny take on it and they usually put pictures, but I mean even if you just Google witches or witches and Trump, everyone reported on this story today and gave the spell.
[00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:52.843]  The spell is included in all the ingredients all the little wannabe witches need to cast a spell on Donald Trump.
[00:13:53.183 --> 00:13:55.444]  This is absolutely insane.
[00:13:55.804 --> 00:13:57.165]  So I'm wondering, you know, now
[00:13:58.406 --> 00:14:06.688]  The spell is basically a binding spell, so they just want to stop Trump and his supporters from doing anything bad, or saying anything mean, or harming anyone.
[00:14:07.088 --> 00:14:07.648]  Which, you know what?
[00:14:08.068 --> 00:14:08.749]  I'm okay with it.
[00:14:09.009 --> 00:14:18.931]  Sure, I don't want anyone to harm anyone, but why don't you cast the same binding spell on your little crazy SJW Antifa freaks who are ruining people's towns and punching women?
[00:14:19.351 --> 00:14:21.912]  They're the ones that need to be bound, but
[00:14:22.492 --> 00:14:30.566]  Hopefully with this, after the witches have their fun, they can sit back, chill a little bit, and let Donald Trump do his job.
[00:14:32.719 --> 00:14:39.962]  Real hope and real change for America bellowed from the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland.
[00:14:40.202 --> 00:14:42.323]  If you want to see the Trump agenda, it's very simple.
[00:14:43.163 --> 00:14:44.303]  It was all in the speeches.
[00:14:44.844 --> 00:14:48.685]  He went around to these rallies, but those speeches had tremendous amount of content in them, right?
[00:14:49.085 --> 00:14:55.068]  I happen to believe, and I think many others do, he's probably the greatest public speaker in those large arenas since William Jennings Bryan.
[00:14:55.308 --> 00:14:56.008]  This was Galvin.
[00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:58.169]  I said, remember, we didn't have any money.
[00:14:58.869 --> 00:15:00.750]  Hillary Clinton, these guys, had over $2 billion.
[00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.270]  We had a couple hundred million dollars.
[00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.170]  It was those rallies and those speeches.
[00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:13.113]  All he's doing right now is he's laid out an agenda with those speeches, with the promises he made, and our job every day is just to execute on that.
[00:15:13.193 --> 00:15:16.294]  It's to simply get a path to how those get executed.
[00:15:16.714 --> 00:15:17.774]  We gotta mobilize.
[00:15:18.214 --> 00:15:19.334]  We gotta march forward.
[00:15:19.675 --> 00:15:23.235]  As if it's the most important time in the history of our movement.
[00:15:24.196 --> 00:15:24.936]  Because it is.
[00:15:28.641 --> 00:15:31.623]  Men and women of this movement, there is no time like the present.
[00:15:32.744 --> 00:15:33.845]  So make your voices heard.
[00:15:35.086 --> 00:15:44.753]  In town halls, with your family and your friends, on the internet and in social media, and in all those places where common sense, conservative messages are most desperately needed.
[00:15:45.874 --> 00:15:46.835]  Because this is our time.
[00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:49.097]  From this day forward,
[00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:55.013]  To make America great again, President Trump and I need every ounce of your energy and enthusiasm.
[00:15:55.513 --> 00:15:56.274]  Your conviction.
[00:15:56.694 --> 00:15:57.415]  Your courage.
[00:15:57.935 --> 00:15:58.656]  Your passion.
[00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:02.139]  And we need one more thing, if you're inclined.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.521]  We need your prayers.
[00:16:05.885 --> 00:16:13.807]  But the First Amendment gives all of us, it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans, the right to speak our minds freely.
[00:16:14.567 --> 00:16:21.989]  It gives you the right, and me the right, to criticize fake news, and criticize it strongly.
[00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:30.432]  And many of these groups are part of the large media corporations that have their own agenda, and it's not your agenda.
[00:16:31.212 --> 00:16:33.993]  And it's not the country's agenda, it's their own agenda.
[00:16:34.673 --> 00:16:39.274]  They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly.
[00:16:39.794 --> 00:16:48.477]  But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn't tell the truth.
[00:16:49.116 --> 00:17:01.419]  And our victory was a win for everyone who believes it's time to stand up for America, to stand up for the American worker, and to stand up for the American flag.
[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.540]  And by the way, we love our flag.
[00:17:08.641 --> 00:17:11.321]  By the way, you folks that are in here, this place is packed.
[00:17:12.201 --> 00:17:13.962]  There are lines that go back six blocks.
[00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:17.199]  And I tell you that because you won't read about it, okay?
[00:17:17.659 --> 00:17:20.281]  But there are lines that go back six blocks.
[00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:24.145]  There is such love in this country for everything we stand for.
[00:17:24.485 --> 00:17:26.046]  You saw that on election day.
[00:17:27.428 --> 00:17:28.849]  And you're going to see it more and more.
[00:17:29.761 --> 00:17:42.376]  Meanwhile, as World Net Daily reports, exorcists, witches, and occultists in a number of magical groups are announcing plans for a ritual designed to bind Donald Trump and all who abet him.
[00:17:42.556 --> 00:17:49.664]  The rite, requiring a stub of a candle, a pin, salt matches, a tarot card, a feather, and other odds and ends.
[00:17:49.684 --> 00:17:50.144]  Let's go!
[00:18:06.613 --> 00:18:07.533]  We're good to go.
[00:19:01.172 --> 00:19:03.394]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.694 --> 00:19:15.723]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[00:19:15.743 --> 00:19:23.309]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies, you can look them up for yourself, that show
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[00:21:33.321 --> 00:21:42.044]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:46.606]  Three years in the making, incredible research and the very best ingredients.
[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.531]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.831 --> 00:23:00.757]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:06.803 --> 00:23:08.184]  Well, it's an information war.
[00:23:08.684 --> 00:23:12.087]  And Donald Trump reminded us that again today at CPAC.
[00:23:12.107 --> 00:23:14.528]  He spent a good deal of time talking about the media.
[00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:17.911]  He said, I call it the fake news, the enemy of the people.
[00:23:17.991 --> 00:23:21.153]  They are the enemy of the people, he said, because they have no sources.
[00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:22.014]  They just make up
[00:23:22.774 --> 00:23:24.135]  When there are none.
[00:23:24.555 --> 00:23:28.918]  And he says they need to put their names on these stories so they would have some people backing off of this.
[00:23:28.938 --> 00:23:40.885]  Well, we're going to put some names on this and we're going to talk about what happened both before and after his speech at CPAC that underscores that although the news may be fake, the opposition is real.
[00:23:40.905 --> 00:23:50.350]  And he goes on to talk about how, he says, I'm not against the media, I'm not against the press, I don't mind bad stories if I deserve them, I'm only against fake news and fake media.
[00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:51.271]  So what happened today?
[00:23:52.128 --> 00:24:00.159]  Well, as we had the White House, this is the way it's reported, by The Hill, saying the White House handpicks select media outlets for briefing.
[00:24:00.619 --> 00:24:05.085]  Well, they put it that way because they were not one of the outlets that was select for the briefing.
[00:24:05.796 --> 00:24:10.960]  Now we've had the White House hand-picking select media as long as there's been media.
[00:24:11.521 --> 00:24:17.305]  As long as there's been television and radio, there's been a small cadre of entitled people who get to go there.
[00:24:17.745 --> 00:24:21.248]  Never a complaint about that before, this small guild that controls everything.
[00:24:21.268 --> 00:24:29.115]  Do you remember when Obama was selling Obamacare and ABC was there for an entire week and they would only talk to Obama?
[00:24:29.775 --> 00:24:33.998]  The Republicans said, we'd like to have some equal time to speak on the other side of this issue.
[00:24:34.018 --> 00:24:35.679]  He said, no, no, no, we're not going to give you equal time.
[00:24:35.719 --> 00:24:38.641]  Well, we'd like to buy some time on ABC.
[00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:41.603]  And they said, no, we're not going to even sell you time.
[00:24:42.204 --> 00:24:45.086]  So we're talking about hand-picked select media.
[00:24:45.806 --> 00:24:47.808]  Talk about the White House Correspondents Association.
[00:24:48.168 --> 00:24:49.289]  That is a guild.
[00:24:50.009 --> 00:24:52.871]  That is a little monopoly that they've had control.
[00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:56.653]  They have been the hand-picked select media for generations.
[00:24:57.333 --> 00:24:59.175]  And this is what is really behind.
[00:24:59.195 --> 00:25:02.216]  But these people are becoming a buggy whip guild.
[00:25:02.717 --> 00:25:11.262]  Today we had, after the press conference, Spicer decided to hold an off-camera gaggle with reporters inside his West Wing office.
[00:25:11.702 --> 00:25:16.145]  Instead of the traditional on-camera briefing, they say, in the White House briefing room.
[00:25:16.625 --> 00:25:22.787]  Among outlets not permitted to cover the gaggle were news organizations that President Trump had singled out for criticism, including CNN.
[00:25:22.828 --> 00:25:26.329]  Well, we'll talk about one of the things that CNN did today.
[00:25:26.649 --> 00:25:33.672]  But of course they had people like New York Times, The Hill, Politico, BuzzFeed, The Daily Mail, BBC, LA Times, New York Daily News were among those who were not invited.
[00:25:34.412 --> 00:25:41.698]  Some organizations that were invited, Associated Press and Time Magazine said they were allowed in but they refused to attend.
[00:25:41.999 --> 00:25:48.824]  But they still had ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, Reuters, Bloomberg, McClatchy, you know, the usual suspects that are the entitled people.
[00:25:48.844 --> 00:25:57.352]  And of course, if you think these people are real media, if you think that they are really giving you a fair assessment of what's going on,
[00:25:57.972 --> 00:26:02.234]  Then you need to look at the fact that we had John Podesta today joining the Washington Post as a contributing columnist.
[00:26:02.334 --> 00:26:07.756]  Meanwhile, we have this narrative out there that Donald Trump is opposing the First Amendment.
[00:26:08.216 --> 00:26:12.557]  I have to say, doesn't he have First Amendment rights to speak back when they criticize him?
[00:26:12.757 --> 00:26:14.238]  Take a look at what the Huffington Post did.
[00:26:14.778 --> 00:26:21.341]  The Huffington Post banned a Norwegian journalist who said, yes, Donald Trump is actually right about what's going on in Sweden.
[00:26:21.481 --> 00:26:24.642]  We had the same thing happen here at InfoWars on Tuesday night.
[00:26:25.632 --> 00:26:30.475]  We covered what the press had been saying and lying and mocking Donald Trump for doing.
[00:26:30.495 --> 00:26:34.337]  The late night comedians like Colbert were mocking him about what was going on in Sweden.
[00:26:34.938 --> 00:26:44.363]  So we showed you the information and of course we ran some b-roll which we have used in the past showing Swedish attacks by migrants against women.
[00:26:44.924 --> 00:26:48.126]  We got a restricted access put on that by YouTube.
[00:26:48.766 --> 00:26:49.447]  Age-restricted.
[00:26:49.647 --> 00:26:51.128]  And this is b-roll that we've used before.
[00:26:51.168 --> 00:26:52.529]  They've never done that to us before.
[00:26:52.809 --> 00:26:54.230]  They didn't want that information there.
[00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.872]  They didn't want somebody pushing back against their false narrative.
[00:26:57.052 --> 00:26:58.173]  Neither did Huffington Post.
[00:26:58.693 --> 00:27:06.639]  And the guy says, well, if this is the way Donald Trump has to deal with these people every day, he must go through hell if this is how the press is behaving.
[00:27:06.699 --> 00:27:07.419]  He's not American.
[00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:09.601]  He doesn't realize just how bad this is.
[00:27:10.381 --> 00:27:14.864]  And now we have another little storm that is being cooked up by CNN.
[00:27:15.905 --> 00:27:21.288]  Talking about how Reince Priebus talked to the FBI about the fake stories that they were putting out.
[00:27:21.849 --> 00:27:25.911]  We had Reince Priebus talk to Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.
[00:27:25.991 --> 00:27:32.995]  They were at the White House and he says, McCabe told him, I want you to know that the story in the New York Times is BS.
[00:27:33.375 --> 00:27:34.416]  He said it explicitly.
[00:27:34.696 --> 00:27:36.517]  And then Priebus said, well, what can we do about this?
[00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:38.038]  And he said, well, I have to get back to you.
[00:27:38.058 --> 00:27:41.460]  Eventually he said, look, we're not going to respond to every story that comes out.
[00:27:42.921 --> 00:27:46.445]  The oppositional press is trying to say they're manipulating the FBI.
[00:27:46.645 --> 00:27:47.686]  They're trying to twist this.
[00:27:47.786 --> 00:27:50.249]  No, it's the press who is trying to twist this.
[00:27:50.649 --> 00:27:51.310]  But watch this.
[00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.174]  This is going to develop as another story because they're going to continue down this path.
[00:28:00.925 --> 00:28:03.626]  Millie Weaver reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:28:03.686 --> 00:28:11.688]  We're here in Austin, Texas, outside of the Governor's Mansion, where there's a queer dance-off festival being held.
[00:28:11.948 --> 00:28:21.691]  Well, the image of this festival showed a picture of Donald Trump having his brains blown out by a rainbow that was coming out of a vagina with wings.
[00:28:22.071 --> 00:28:24.092]  So you can see that there's a lot of anti-
[00:28:24.552 --> 00:28:26.333]  Donald Trump sentiment here.
[00:28:26.733 --> 00:28:36.278]  It's also important to note that the governor of Texas is handicapped and does use a wheelchair so he in fact cannot actually dance.
[00:28:36.598 --> 00:28:43.922]  So is this a slight towards the governor because he is handicapped and can't really dance with them even if he wanted to.
[00:28:44.322 --> 00:28:48.124]  So let's go ahead and talk to them and see how they feel about Donald Trump.
[00:28:48.424 --> 00:28:49.985]  But the main thing here is
[00:28:50.905 --> 00:28:59.550]  Are they going to be tolerant towards me because I'm an InfoWars supporter while they're trying to say that conservatives need to be tolerant of them?
[00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.190]  Hi.
[00:29:02.111 --> 00:29:03.792]  What were you saying about InfoWars?
[00:29:03.932 --> 00:29:05.593]  I just said that's InfoWars.
[00:29:05.993 --> 00:29:07.814]  Well, what brings you out here today?
[00:29:08.835 --> 00:29:09.716]  The dance party!
[00:29:10.616 --> 00:29:13.478]  I think that people should be able to use whatever bathroom they want.
[00:29:14.158 --> 00:29:14.498]  Yeah?
[00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:20.402]  So, do you think that people should be forced to refer to people by their pronouns?
[00:29:20.862 --> 00:29:23.984]  No, I don't, but I think it's a very courteous and kind thing to do.
[00:29:24.244 --> 00:29:25.725]  My pronoun is they.
[00:29:26.365 --> 00:29:28.967]  Honestly, I'm out here in response to
[00:29:29.987 --> 00:29:32.069]  So many things that have been going on for the past couple months.
[00:29:32.089 --> 00:29:37.995]  I think it's important to get out and show and have a community and show that we're not afraid.
[00:29:38.195 --> 00:29:43.060]  Whoa, excuse me.
[00:29:46.002 --> 00:29:47.804]  Wait, so aren't you guys tolerant?
[00:29:47.864 --> 00:29:49.185]  Don't you guys want tolerance?
[00:29:49.926 --> 00:29:50.647]  I'm tolerant?
[00:29:51.788 --> 00:29:52.228]  Yes.
[00:29:52.248 --> 00:29:54.731]  So, why are you saying, ask me that if you're tolerant?
[00:29:55.511 --> 00:30:01.256]  There you go, tolerance folks!
[00:30:02.076 --> 00:30:08.401]  Alex Jones is a coca, that's why he's so paranoid!
[00:30:08.822 --> 00:30:11.123]  Do a drug test, Alex Jones, a drug test!
[00:30:12.725 --> 00:30:14.686]  Do you stand for tolerance?
[00:30:15.146 --> 00:30:16.407]  F*** you guys, you guys are fake news!
[00:30:16.427 --> 00:30:18.929]  We don't want to hear your bullsh**, we don't like your hate!
[00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.152]  You have no room to talk about tolerance!
[00:30:27.488 --> 00:30:27.748]  Wow.
[00:30:27.868 --> 00:30:30.169]  What do you guys think about Milo Yiannopoulos?
[00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:36.051]  I'm so glad that he f***ing is just going to... Don't engage!
[00:30:36.131 --> 00:30:36.891]  Don't engage!
[00:30:36.931 --> 00:30:37.952]  Take your head out of here!
[00:30:37.972 --> 00:30:38.772]  Sorry, can't hear you.
[00:30:38.792 --> 00:30:41.773]  Take your head out of here!
[00:30:41.793 --> 00:30:42.773]  Take your head out of here!
[00:30:49.984 --> 00:30:50.325]  Hi!
[00:30:50.945 --> 00:30:53.467]  What do you think about Milo Yiannopoulos?
[00:30:54.028 --> 00:30:55.850]  Did you bring Paul Joseph Watson?
[00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:56.690]  I'd like to meet him.
[00:30:57.291 --> 00:30:58.292]  No, we didn't.
[00:30:58.852 --> 00:31:00.394]  You used to like him, Phil Worth.
[00:31:00.474 --> 00:31:06.500]  Yeah, until they, you know, got on this pro-Trump kick and Alex Jones is worshipping Trump now.
[00:31:07.861 --> 00:31:08.682]  Don't engage!
[00:31:08.722 --> 00:31:10.243]  Don't engage!
[00:31:10.403 --> 00:31:11.104]  Don't listen to them!
[00:31:11.124 --> 00:31:11.844]  You have free speech!
[00:31:11.864 --> 00:31:12.325]  Don't engage!
[00:31:12.545 --> 00:31:12.985]  Don't engage!
[00:31:13.306 --> 00:31:15.288]  So you want to shut down people's free speech?
[00:31:17.403 --> 00:31:18.543]  She has free speech!
[00:31:18.563 --> 00:31:19.224]  Don't engage!
[00:31:19.764 --> 00:31:20.684]  Will you marry me?
[00:31:20.904 --> 00:31:21.804]  I want to engage.
[00:31:23.204 --> 00:31:31.966]  As you can see, the LGTB protesters were not very tolerant of me based on the way I look and the InfoWars moniker.
[00:31:31.986 --> 00:31:35.027]  You know, they were yelling at me slurs and so on and so forth.
[00:31:35.287 --> 00:31:39.928]  So let's see how tolerant they are towards Rainbow Snatch.
[00:31:40.208 --> 00:31:41.328]  I'm gonna go undercover.
[00:31:41.368 --> 00:31:45.889]  I'm gonna dress as Rainbow Snatch and I'm gonna see if they treat me differently and if they even
[00:31:46.329 --> 00:31:46.649]  Notice!
[00:32:04.428 --> 00:32:05.989]  2018, we all need a vote.
[00:32:06.009 --> 00:32:06.509]  We need a vote?
[00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:08.050]  But what if that's not enough?
[00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:09.211]  What if that's not enough?
[00:32:09.271 --> 00:32:10.972]  What if that's not enough?
[00:32:10.992 --> 00:32:17.977]  2018, all the BS supporting artists for a year, all the names for a year, and it's 2018 where it really counts.
[00:32:18.077 --> 00:32:24.962]  If you think about it, how we got in the first place in this situation, we did not vote during the mid-election.
[00:32:24.982 --> 00:32:25.442]  That was it.
[00:32:25.462 --> 00:32:26.523]  Do you know about Milo?
[00:32:26.563 --> 00:32:29.024]  That's her, but Gabe's not supporting.
[00:32:29.104 --> 00:32:31.766]  Like, so... There's such a split in that.
[00:32:31.826 --> 00:32:34.188]  I don't know which personality to listen to.
[00:32:35.689 --> 00:32:46.059]  I think that Donald Trump is the worst fascist to hit the United States since Hitler hit Europe.
[00:32:46.119 --> 00:32:47.740]  That's what Donald Trump is.
[00:32:47.861 --> 00:32:48.241]  A fascist.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:44.212]  Again, fund the InfoWars.
[00:36:44.412 --> 00:36:48.393]  Get the game-changing nanotech tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.833 --> 00:36:50.854]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.874 --> 00:36:50.854]  $200.
[00:36:51.454 --> 00:36:54.394]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:36:54.474 --> 00:36:55.235]  It's amazing.
[00:37:05.837 --> 00:37:09.278]  And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news.
[00:37:09.538 --> 00:37:10.098]  It's fake.
[00:37:10.458 --> 00:37:10.858]  Phony.
[00:37:11.018 --> 00:37:11.278]  Fake.
[00:37:17.347 --> 00:37:21.933]  A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people, and they are.
[00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:23.775]  They are the enemy of the people.
[00:37:26.659 --> 00:37:32.306]  Because they have no sources, they just make them up when there are none.
[00:37:33.121 --> 00:37:37.165]  I saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed.
[00:37:37.345 --> 00:37:38.386]  There are no nine people.
[00:37:38.927 --> 00:37:40.608]  I don't believe there was one or two people.
[00:37:40.929 --> 00:37:41.709]  Nine people.
[00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:44.953]  And I said, give me a break, because I know the people.
[00:37:45.613 --> 00:37:46.714]  I know who they talk to.
[00:37:47.395 --> 00:37:49.577]  There were no nine people, but they say nine people.
[00:37:49.958 --> 00:37:52.900]  And somebody reads it, they think, oh, nine people, they have nine sources.
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:53.981]  They make up sources.
[00:37:54.802 --> 00:37:56.162]  They're very dishonest people.
[00:37:56.203 --> 00:38:05.505]  In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people.
[00:38:05.565 --> 00:38:06.566]  The fake news.
[00:38:07.306 --> 00:38:10.047]  They dropped off the word fake.
[00:38:10.887 --> 00:38:16.769]  And all of a sudden, the story became the media is the enemy.
[00:38:16.809 --> 00:38:18.289]  They take the word fake out.
[00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:22.511]  And now I'm saying, oh no, this is no good.
[00:38:23.564 --> 00:38:24.484]  That's the way they are.
[00:38:24.725 --> 00:38:25.145]  That's right.
[00:38:25.725 --> 00:38:27.326]  So I'm not against the media.
[00:38:27.686 --> 00:38:29.047]  I'm not against the press.
[00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:32.048]  I don't mind bad stories if I deserve them.
[00:38:33.189 --> 00:38:36.410]  And I tell you, I love good stories, but we won't talk.
[00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:39.291]  I don't get too many of them.
[00:38:39.852 --> 00:38:40.712]  Because you're good, buddy.
[00:38:40.992 --> 00:38:46.295]  But I am only against the fake news media or press.
[00:38:46.455 --> 00:38:46.755]  Fake.
[00:38:47.175 --> 00:38:47.435]  Fake.
[00:38:47.495 --> 00:38:48.596]  They have to leave that word.
[00:38:49.396 --> 00:38:51.057]  I'm against the people.
[00:38:51.715 --> 00:38:52.735]  Who are screwing this country over.
[00:38:53.135 --> 00:38:55.776]  Who are bought and paid for by the special interests who think they own you.
[00:38:55.796 --> 00:39:08.659]  And look, the years of selling America, if Trump is successful, and I believe he will be, the years of the globalists selling us out and then telling themselves how smart they are, feeding off the great engine of American ingenuity, are over.
[00:39:09.859 --> 00:39:12.520]  And that's why it's so sad to see the weak-minded that still hate Trump.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:17.481]  But if you actually study what he's doing, it's all very fair, it's very historical, it's very measured.
[00:39:19.059 --> 00:39:26.145]  He's so good that actually it makes me deep down suspect myself because my discernment says he's solid gold.
[00:39:26.525 --> 00:39:27.486]  I was saying that two years ago.
[00:39:27.506 --> 00:39:28.948]  I said, my gut tells me he's great.
[00:39:29.928 --> 00:39:31.189]  But I just said, I can't believe it.
[00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:33.892]  And now it's just like, what?
[00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:38.755]  It's not because he calls me sometimes on the telephone.
[00:39:39.195 --> 00:39:43.097]  You know, I put out articles, I put out stories, I say he doesn't get a lot of his ideas from me.
[00:39:43.817 --> 00:39:44.958]  We're just on the same page.
[00:39:45.318 --> 00:39:51.080]  You know, Bannon I know has listened over the years, and Breitbart's written about that, but we're promoting the same Americana.
[00:39:51.321 --> 00:39:52.921]  I listen to his ideas, he listens to mine.
[00:39:53.161 --> 00:39:54.722]  I mean, yeah, we're all prominent leaders.
[00:39:54.802 --> 00:39:56.123]  Drudge's ideas get listened to.
[00:39:56.983 --> 00:40:03.590]  We're all prominent leaders in promoting Americana and freedom, but it's not like we all look at a 57 Chevy that's midnight blue and white.
[00:40:03.751 --> 00:40:05.913]  I saw one today, unbelievable, driving into work.
[00:40:06.874 --> 00:40:12.821]  And it made me think, it's like 20 people could look at that and say, that's a beautiful piece of art right there.
[00:40:13.642 --> 00:40:16.285]  So Trump says, look at that 57 Chevy, isn't it beautiful?
[00:40:16.305 --> 00:40:18.067]  Isn't it cool looking?
[00:40:19.571 --> 00:40:20.551]  And I say absolutely.
[00:40:20.591 --> 00:40:23.712]  It's not like he's telling me what to think, or I'm telling him what to think.
[00:40:24.072 --> 00:40:34.576]  We're like, wouldn't it be nice if we had clean burning coal, which we have, and thousands of plants around the country, and almost a thousand they shut down, and that's why most people won't come here, they tell Trump, because our electricity is too expensive now.
[00:40:34.916 --> 00:40:38.797]  Oh wow, it's twice as cheap in Mexico, on average.
[00:40:39.838 --> 00:40:41.298]  It's three times cheaper in China.
[00:40:41.958 --> 00:40:44.719]  You know, we might want to actually have a coal plant here.
[00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:46.620]  Plus, ours are cleaner than theirs.
[00:40:50.822 --> 00:40:51.723]  I agree with Trump on that.
[00:40:51.943 --> 00:40:52.524]  He agrees with me.
[00:40:52.544 --> 00:40:53.825]  Because I've got articles.
[00:40:54.145 --> 00:40:55.587]  He's following Alex on coal.
[00:40:55.847 --> 00:40:57.149]  He's following Alex on guns.
[00:40:57.389 --> 00:40:58.570]  He's following Alex on borders.
[00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:02.194]  He's following Alex on the terms he uses in enemy media.
[00:41:03.499 --> 00:41:04.600]  And quite frankly, I have.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:19.210]  I thought back, in one of my conversations with Trump, I said, they are your enemy, and they will never stop until you're destroyed, and they will never, never back off, and they will never make deals, and Hillary's gonna double back on her deal, and she is not gonna ever stop trying to set you up.
[00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:20.931]  They've got fifth columns inside.
[00:41:21.111 --> 00:41:22.372]  They're gonna block your agenda 100%.
[00:41:22.652 --> 00:41:25.614]  So he says, very interesting, Alex, hold on one moment.
[00:41:25.974 --> 00:41:28.135]  Comes back and goes, yeah, yeah, we think that's real interesting.
[00:41:28.155 --> 00:41:29.096]  Tell me more about that.
[00:41:29.376 --> 00:41:30.817]  Sure, I'll tell the media what we talked about.
[00:41:31.057 --> 00:41:32.959]  We talked about how you are the enemy.
[00:41:33.719 --> 00:41:37.062]  So if I take credit for one thing, it's introducing the term enemy media.
[00:41:37.242 --> 00:41:48.472]  Because you are the enemy, and we had a show two years ago, several, in fact we found the clip, I tweeted it out last week, where the listeners, we all had two hours of phone calls on what is the name of the media.
[00:41:48.512 --> 00:41:55.218]  The scum media, the whore media, the sellout media, the fake stream media, the sewer stream media, the dinosaur media, one of my terms.
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:58.762]  Prostitutes, Gerald Cilente term, and I said, you know what?
[00:41:58.822 --> 00:42:00.063]  They're the enemy!
[00:42:00.504 --> 00:42:02.385]  We gotta find all those clips and put them together with Trump.
[00:42:02.666 --> 00:42:07.890]  Yes, yes, but it isn't because Trump was under my mind control and it's some easily influenced person.
[00:42:08.691 --> 00:42:11.153]  He didn't even comment when I kept saying, they're the enemy.
[00:42:11.473 --> 00:42:12.294]  They're the enemy, he goes.
[00:42:14.716 --> 00:42:15.817]  Yes, very interesting.
[00:42:16.878 --> 00:42:17.379]  Yes!
[00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:33.253]  And it's not, it's that he's so good, that he's so dialed in, and that now it's being said by the President of the United States, annihilating scum that's on CNN, saying full-grown men should be with little girls in showers!
[00:42:33.493 --> 00:42:34.774]  I'm gonna play that clip in a minute.
[00:42:35.114 --> 00:42:36.754]  I mean, of course it's the damn enemy!
[00:42:36.774 --> 00:42:42.576]  I mean, it's the, it's the screwball, control freak, crazy people enemy.
[00:42:43.936 --> 00:42:47.797]  That wants to just run every, people always read about authoritarian regimes and how crazy they are.
[00:42:48.976 --> 00:43:06.839]  Ceausescu in Romania wouldn't give most of the country electricity but a few days a week and would have them, the public, beg him for it, but they would see his big city on a hill, the government district, lit up for miles with just bright lights and big strobe lights and, I have light and you don't, oh, I have air conditioning in a car, you don't.
[00:43:07.159 --> 00:43:08.139]  Shame Obama crap!
[00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:17.601]  Imagine being the type of scumbag with a spirit of hatred for humanity where you want to go tell Africans they can't have electricity, medicine or cars, basically is what he said.
[00:43:21.036 --> 00:43:21.936]  People are like, that's horrible.
[00:43:22.176 --> 00:43:22.737]  Absolutely.
[00:43:23.237 --> 00:43:25.858]  They get off on you not having something.
[00:43:26.018 --> 00:43:30.679]  You ever been around people that are totally jealous, total control freaks, absolutely hateful of everything you've got?
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:42.864]  Really good looking people have experienced this, and a lot of times they become wicked and mean because everybody else is mean to them, but when you have a good looking person that isn't wicked and hateful, they're usually some of the nicest people you know, because they've gone through a lot of people being mean to them.
[00:43:43.184 --> 00:43:45.665]  It's the same thing if you're good at sports, or you're good at art, or whatever.
[00:43:45.985 --> 00:43:49.666]  You think people are going to embrace you and love you, but haters gonna hate.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.061]  And that's the same deal.
[00:43:52.081 --> 00:43:53.883]  But Donald Trump, he's so confident.
[00:43:54.123 --> 00:43:55.144]  He's so proud.
[00:43:55.384 --> 00:43:56.566]  He feels so good.
[00:43:57.066 --> 00:43:58.107]  He's so honorable.
[00:43:58.628 --> 00:44:04.034]  He'll run over big, powerful kingpins and people, but he's not going to run over little people because he wants to give you a shot.
[00:44:04.054 --> 00:44:09.160]  Because Donald Trump doesn't need you to be down in the dirt for him to feel good about himself.
[00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:30.080]  He's got the best-looking wife, and super smart, and a great, smart, good-looking family, and is successful, and is honorable, and has beat the establishment his whole life, because they tried to keep his dad from building buildings in New York, and his dad, behind the scenes, did a lot of stuff, I've been looking into it all, where Trump really came from, kicking people's asses to get where they're at, behind the scenes.
[00:44:31.561 --> 00:44:40.226]  You think you just go into New York City in the 20s and 30s and 40s and, you know, do a lot of stuff like that, when you got a German last name, you're not Italian, you're not Irish, you're not English?
[00:44:42.162 --> 00:44:44.903]  The truth is, the whole Trump family are a bunch of badasses.
[00:44:45.243 --> 00:44:46.424]  And they know what they're doing.
[00:44:46.664 --> 00:44:49.325]  And they have been through what you've been through.
[00:44:49.565 --> 00:44:52.706]  And they want to run the New World Order in the ground.
[00:44:52.947 --> 00:44:54.987]  And all you gotta do is start backing them.
[00:44:56.088 --> 00:44:58.069]  And my family history is very, very similar.
[00:44:58.925 --> 00:45:00.806]  Good people that aren't looking to dominate people.
[00:45:01.006 --> 00:45:09.168]  But when thugs and scum and gangs want to start something, it's like a sheepdog trained, born, bred to take you on and rip your political throats out.
[00:45:09.408 --> 00:45:10.689]  And now you're starting to feel it.
[00:45:11.009 --> 00:45:24.013]  Now you're running up against people that aren't scared of what you do, aren't scared of what happens to us, just as long as you get your head rammed in the concrete politically and learn that you're not going to pick on little people anymore while you claim you take care of them all day.
[00:45:24.753 --> 00:45:25.553]  I love the Democrats.
[00:45:25.753 --> 00:45:26.874]  Fought the Civil Rights Act.
[00:45:26.934 --> 00:45:28.434]  Fought the end of slavery.
[00:45:28.494 --> 00:45:29.254]  Fought everything.
[00:45:29.435 --> 00:45:32.055]  And they got Republicans blamed for doing it all.
[00:45:32.636 --> 00:45:33.116]  But you know what?
[00:45:33.136 --> 00:45:35.737]  The Republican Party's made of the same type of inbred elitist crap.
[00:45:35.797 --> 00:45:36.737]  They're racist too.
[00:45:37.397 --> 00:45:38.617]  That's why they're all in this together.
[00:45:38.837 --> 00:45:40.538]  And Donald Trump's not, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:40.758 --> 00:45:43.519]  So if you don't see that, and if you don't know that, you're an idiot.
[00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:45.820]  But Trump did see.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:46.520]  I'm going to skip the break.
[00:45:48.018 --> 00:45:52.583]  Trump did see that killed our nationalism and taught us to say we even had borders was bad or racist.
[00:45:52.903 --> 00:46:04.675]  He had to invoke the right of saying we're allowed to have a country, we're allowed to be together, and we're allowed to have a culture and a system and a birthright.
[00:46:06.536 --> 00:46:07.297]  And that's all this is.
[00:46:07.317 --> 00:46:09.800]  Now since I've been mentioning this, let me get to this clip first.
[00:46:11.758 --> 00:46:14.942]  Get to Cuomo, who wants your daughters to have men in the showers with them.
[00:46:15.302 --> 00:46:16.864]  Oh yeah, you're a racist now.
[00:46:16.904 --> 00:46:17.865]  You're a bigot if you don't.
[00:46:18.606 --> 00:46:22.089]  Because little, little know-it-all pretty boy says so.
[00:46:24.312 --> 00:46:25.853]  What a piece of trash in my view.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.922]  Glenn Beck, Bannon's economic nationalism agenda is not conservative, it's dangerous.
[00:46:30.942 --> 00:46:34.584]  This is like saying, if you're against child molestation, you're dangerous.
[00:46:34.664 --> 00:46:36.885]  If you're against the plague, you're dangerous.
[00:46:36.905 --> 00:46:38.966]  If you're against getting the flu, you're dangerous.
[00:46:39.727 --> 00:46:48.051]  If you believe you should run your country and that your nation ought to be set up for the taxpayers to build a good culture for your country, then your country wants to help people sometimes, that's fine, but Congress votes on it.
[00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:48.591]  No, no, no.
[00:46:48.611 --> 00:46:58.114]  If you don't want foreign multinationals like TPP and the globalists and the communist Chinese buying up Hollywood, running your life, telling you who can be president, telling you what you can do, you're a bad person!
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.717]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.474]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.815 --> 00:48:50.495]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.555 --> 00:48:51.156]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.516 --> 00:48:59.063]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.083 --> 00:48:59.964]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.984 --> 00:49:00.024]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.362 --> 00:49:12.003]  This is Millie Weaver and you're watching the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:49:12.323 --> 00:49:21.286]  We have a special guest on today, Louis Buff Perry, the renowned codebreaker and a past intelligence advisor.
[00:49:21.667 --> 00:49:32.170]  So we're going to be talking with Buff today about Code 19, a code that he cracked regarding Al Qaeda and how they used it to commit terrorist acts like 9-11.
[00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:34.391]  So let's go ahead and talk to Buff.
[00:49:35.191 --> 00:49:37.873]  All right, Buffs, so thank you so much for joining us.
[00:49:38.234 --> 00:49:41.856]  Can you tell us a little bit about what Code 19 is?
[00:49:44.118 --> 00:50:03.113]  It's a concentration on the number as a pattern in nature, as a workable number in human culture and artifice that we can date back to
[00:50:04.173 --> 00:50:24.542]  A little more than 8,000 years ago to a place called Çatalhöyük in Turkey, where there's a lot of art using black and red pigment on stone that repeats patterns of 19 objects over and over again.
[00:50:25.422 --> 00:50:29.264]  I've only found something like that in a similar manner
[00:50:32.438 --> 00:50:42.271]  In Colorado, at a place called La Garita, which bears a number of petroglyphs and pictographs.
[00:50:42.431 --> 00:50:45.435]  These are rock carvings and paintings.
[00:50:46.638 --> 00:50:50.141]  That that shows again this pattern 19.
[00:50:50.301 --> 00:50:59.128]  I don't know exactly what the date is on on the Colorado example, but I was there up front and close, right?
[00:50:59.148 --> 00:51:00.749]  It right in person with it and it.
[00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:02.571]  It's an awesome and eerie.
[00:51:04.432 --> 00:51:11.538]  Pictographs in meaning it's painted rather than carved into stone or pecked into stone, but it it it repeats again.
[00:51:11.598 --> 00:51:13.840]  The 1919 17 stick figures that are that
[00:51:17.537 --> 00:51:22.440]  Have an owl on one end and then an owl on the other, equaling 19.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:29.024]  19 is also very common in in Uto-Aztecan architecture and Mayan architecture.
[00:51:29.044 --> 00:51:39.651]  18 and 19, 18 by 19, for ground plans, layouts, you know, what we would call today blueprints.
[00:51:40.932 --> 00:51:46.615]  So there's something about the pattern of 19 that has caught
[00:51:47.173 --> 00:51:48.154]  Human attention.
[00:51:49.235 --> 00:51:58.163]  Through our whole history, anywhere there's any recording of our history, it eventually will pop up.
[00:51:59.124 --> 00:52:05.910]  And, you know, I'm still asking questions around what is the ultimate draw?
[00:52:07.371 --> 00:52:10.594]  As you go deeper into it, you find people have
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.802]  I have tried to sort this out.
[00:52:13.862 --> 00:52:38.882]  Jeffrey Ashe, who wrote a book, I think it's called The Wisdom of History, and he suggested that it has to do with 12, all through human history, with the recognition of 12 zodiac symbols, or 12 zodiacs, and seven planets,
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:51.130]  Because for the majority of the time that we've been stargazing, it's always been 7, not any other number of planets until later, until more recent times.
[00:52:51.790 --> 00:53:02.839]  So 7 and 12 comes to 19, and that might have been, for the ancient ones, you know, a mystical number because of that combination of the 7 and the 12.
[00:53:05.347 --> 00:53:07.248]  I'm not saying that, but Jeffrey Asch is.
[00:53:07.328 --> 00:53:13.549]  So there are scholars, other scholars, who have tried their hand at trying to figure all of this out.
[00:53:13.729 --> 00:53:17.850]  I don't think anybody has really completely figured it out.
[00:53:18.631 --> 00:53:27.373]  Why it has become so important in religious contexts is really baffling.
[00:53:27.593 --> 00:53:31.634]  In early Judaism, you couldn't question
[00:53:32.443 --> 00:53:47.435]  Without punishment, what the secret of 19 is, and in the most commonly repeated Hebrew prayers, it's called the Shema, there are exactly 19 syllables.
[00:53:48.215 --> 00:53:54.480]  Shema, Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai Ahad, if you break it down, and then Amin at the end.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:54.740]  There's 19.
[00:53:56.391 --> 00:54:12.204]  In Islam, the same happens with the introduction to every chapter in the Qur'an, Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim, that translated is, in the name of God, the Beneficent, the Merciful, and again, 19 syllables!
[00:54:13.505 --> 00:54:23.893]  So, clearly, it isn't confined to one tradition, or to one religion, one culture, it's a pan-human
[00:54:25.294 --> 00:54:37.285]  And I think I might have begun to get closer to breaking the ultimate code of 19.
[00:54:37.886 --> 00:54:40.088]  Why is this number so extraordinary?
[00:54:40.108 --> 00:54:46.254]  And what's required is to look at it from many, many different angles.
[00:54:46.874 --> 00:54:50.858]  The Enigma code was used, but it was actually
[00:54:51.443 --> 00:54:53.003]  Wow, that's pretty amazing.
[00:54:53.023 --> 00:54:58.124]  And I know you spoke a little bit on certain groups that were using this.
[00:54:58.144 --> 00:55:02.985]  So, who exactly is using Code 19?
[00:55:22.059 --> 00:55:24.280]  From a religious point of view?
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:30.041]  Yes, from a religious point of view, because I know you mentioned a little bit about Al-Qaeda using this code.
[00:55:31.281 --> 00:55:34.542]  Well, Al-Qaeda definitely used it.
[00:55:34.662 --> 00:55:45.065]  The Baha'i, maybe it'll be more foundational to give the example of an actual entire world religion,
[00:55:46.124 --> 00:55:49.905]  that has formed out of this number 19, and it's the Baha'i.
[00:55:50.225 --> 00:55:56.147]  They emerged out of the Shiite branch of Islam, and everything in the Baha'i is about 19.
[00:55:57.028 --> 00:56:07.591]  But if there are 19 people together who are Baha'i, they're recreating a God on Earth concept that they call the Manifestation.
[00:56:09.012 --> 00:56:12.573]  But Al Qaeda, when you really
[00:56:13.385 --> 00:56:26.451]  Focus carefully and penetratingly on what is the likeliest scenario or theory behind their actions on 9-11.
[00:56:28.351 --> 00:56:41.097]  What hit me first, and I still stick with it, is a verse in chapter 74, verse 30 of the Quran that states, above there are 19.
[00:56:43.536 --> 00:57:12.613]  And that verse is surrounded by other verses that come before and follow thereafter that are warnings to humankind about sinning and about turning our backs on the sacred writs and things like that, and what damage will be wrought if we don't do what we should be doing, you know, as humble, pious people.
[00:57:13.462 --> 00:57:14.863]  With each our own sacred writs.
[00:57:16.064 --> 00:57:18.106]  That's what surrounds this, above there are 19.
[00:57:18.406 --> 00:57:21.989]  They are the guardians, the angels of the fire.
[00:57:23.611 --> 00:57:37.363]  And when 9-11 happened, it was that night after, by the way, I got a phone call from the intelligence agent assigned to the Israeli embassy, which we can touch on a little bit later.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:47.763]  But that night it just totally dawned on me that there is this verse in the Koran, above there are 19.
[00:57:48.103 --> 00:57:53.465]  There were 19 hijackers on 9-11, not 20.
[00:57:53.585 --> 00:58:06.470]  The FBI at that time was very persistent about there having to be a 20th intended hijacker.
[00:58:07.947 --> 00:58:12.570]  And they went through two or three or four different different suspects.
[00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:19.073]  Zacharias Massawi was the person who was charged with being the intended 20th hijacker.
[00:58:19.093 --> 00:58:22.996]  I came forward with code 19.
[00:58:24.256 --> 00:58:25.817]  Was interviewed by the FBI.
[00:58:26.938 --> 00:58:28.539]  And the charges were lifted.
[00:58:28.739 --> 00:58:31.580]  That charge was lifted from Zacharias Massawi.
[00:58:33.121 --> 00:58:36.023]  And I had also been in contact with his lawyer.
[00:58:37.319 --> 00:58:38.140]  On this point.
[00:58:39.721 --> 00:58:43.163]  Wow, that was a very interesting interview with Louis Buff Perry.
