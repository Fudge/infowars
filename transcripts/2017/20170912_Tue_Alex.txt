[00:00:17.302 --> 00:00:22.328]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:22.328 --> 00:00:23.790]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:35.595]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's already September 12, 2017 on this Tuesday Global Broadcast.
[00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:39.238]  We have five different, very informative guests joining us today.
[00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:41.359]  We've got some very good news.
[00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:51.266]  Census Bureau shows median income climbs for the first time since 2007, which previously was the highest level for the median income.
[00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.227]  So, great again.
[00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:54.808]  Incomes are up.
[00:00:54.808 --> 00:00:57.029]  The Trump effect is in effect.
[00:00:57.029 --> 00:01:01.991]  But all is not well, ladies and gentlemen, up in Rapunzel's castle.
[00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:04.792]  Report McMaster labeled Trump scary and a dope.
[00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:08.433]  Deep State drugging Trump ahead of coup, sources say.
[00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:10.694]  Well, sources are questioning.
[00:01:10.694 --> 00:01:17.397]  And our reports yesterday got picked up, obviously, all over TV, radio and print yesterday, and distorted.
[00:01:17.397 --> 00:01:19.018]  The big news is that Keith Schiller,
[00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:30.111]  Almost 30 year closest confidant to Trump resigned and Trump didn't even know it was happening because he couldn't even get in to see Trump for days.
[00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:32.012]  I mean, this is total isolation.
[00:01:32.012 --> 00:01:33.552]  This isn't command and control.
[00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:37.274]  This is a deep state coup of another type.
[00:01:37.274 --> 00:01:46.458]  Yeah, we didn't want the deep state coup of Hillary and austerity and gun confiscation and race war, but we trade that out now for another deep state?
[00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:47.139]  And I'll say this.
[00:01:48.268 --> 00:01:55.198]  Americans, white, black, Christian, whatever, don't go and try to lobby for political control.
[00:01:56.578 --> 00:02:08.900]  But if you look at the camps trying to lobby for control inside the White House right now, there's a giant Islamicist-Wahhabist camp through McMaster, and a bunch of Arabists, basically, is what it's called at the State Department.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:15.162]  That's Westerners that have kind of gone native and bought into the whole Islamic takeover plan, usually for money.
[00:02:15.162 --> 00:02:21.823]  And then you've got the Israel lobby in there, fighting as well, and I don't like either side being involved.
[00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:30.453]  Those are the factions, because the American people are on the sidelines, not politically aware, politically ignorant.
[00:02:30.453 --> 00:02:45.908]  So, we're going to be discussing all of this coming up, ladies and gentlemen, but right now, it's the Israel lobby, the conservative Israel lobby, there's more than one, that is backing the tax cuts, backing the basic Trump agenda.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:57.450]  And you see the whole Islamic, through the culture, even through Hollywood, anti-Israel propaganda has become like mother's milk in this country.
[00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.333]  And it shows how the Islamists' brainwashing has worked so incredibly well.
[00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:03.615]  And I'm not saying Israel is perfect.
[00:03:03.615 --> 00:03:06.238]  Israel's got big problems, diverse politics.
[00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:08.840]  They're trying to indict Netanyahu and his wife right now.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.882]  The same stuff they're doing to Trump.
[00:03:10.882 --> 00:03:11.523]  Just know this.
[00:03:12.728 --> 00:03:21.692]  Just know this, there's large elements of the Israel lobby trying to stabilize the United States and actually trying to stop the complete race war overthrow of the country.
[00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:29.455]  Because see, George Soros, it came out in documents last year in WikiLeaks and in others, that he wants to overthrow Israel.
[00:03:29.455 --> 00:03:32.016]  So Israel finally gets it.
[00:03:32.016 --> 00:03:39.879]  That okay, they want to overthrow Israel, they want to overthrow the U.S., they want to overthrow free market, and what, replace it with a bunch of Muslims killing each other?
[00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:44.346]  So, I've been studying this.
[00:03:44.346 --> 00:03:48.487]  You've got the weird Communist Pope faction.
[00:03:48.487 --> 00:03:53.428]  You've got the EU Socialist Bureaucrat Banker faction.
[00:03:53.428 --> 00:03:57.089]  And then you've got the US Anglo-American faction with the UK.
[00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:59.169]  I mean, these are the different power structures.
[00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.669]  And they're all fighting for control.
[00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.870]  Meanwhile, Trump comes in and is just trying to stabilize the economy and not have a global depression.
[00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.470]  And it's starting to work.
[00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.291]  And that's why everybody hates him in the establishment because
[00:04:11.687 --> 00:04:13.089]  They're not in control.
[00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:22.081]  The people got a beachhead in Washington and they'd rather see everything go to hell in a handbasket and everything collapse as long as they're in charge of it.
[00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:23.804]  Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.
[00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:29.368]  And so it's the same old power struggle over who controls the White House.
[00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:30.709]  I didn't go to D.C.
[00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:32.249]  or New York or L.A.
[00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:34.170]  to build an operation against the globalists.
[00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.431]  I did it in Texas.
[00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:43.255]  I don't want to go drink wine and hang around with a bunch of folks and decide I've arrived and try to be part of the power structure.
[00:04:43.255 --> 00:04:48.597]  I want to overthrow the corrupt globalist system and restore the republic.
[00:04:48.597 --> 00:04:49.958]  I want to change the world.
[00:04:50.558 --> 00:04:54.062]  Not be part of the sycophant trough in Washington, D.C.
[00:04:54.062 --> 00:04:59.689]  So all you bureaucrats and generals and all you, you get that through your head.
[00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:06.136]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:18.762]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in InfoWars live broadcasting.
[00:05:18.762 --> 00:05:21.305]  We are live weekdays from 3 to 6 p.m.

[00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:37.261]  We are going to have the most powerful guest, the most powerful host.
[00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:42.403]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly, as well as taking your phone calls.
[00:05:42.403 --> 00:05:46.005]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[00:05:46.005 --> 00:05:48.926]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[00:05:48.926 --> 00:05:50.187]  This is The War Room.
[00:06:00.091 --> 00:06:05.495]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at m4store.com.
[00:06:05.495 --> 00:06:08.357]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:06:08.357 --> 00:06:10.338]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:06:10.338 --> 00:06:15.341]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:17.442]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:06:17.442 --> 00:06:18.743]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:06:18.743 --> 00:06:23.867]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:27.229]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:27.710]  I'm good.
[00:06:44.332 --> 00:06:51.822]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.

[00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:11.118]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:11.118 --> 00:08:16.783]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:08:26.229 --> 00:08:30.394]  There is mass looting going on all over the Eastern Caribbean.
[00:08:30.394 --> 00:08:31.715]  In the U.S.
[00:08:31.715 --> 00:08:38.882]  Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands, and in French possessions as well.
[00:08:38.882 --> 00:08:41.986]  There is mass looting going on all over Florida.
[00:08:43.755 --> 00:08:46.176]  And there have been arrests all over Florida.
[00:08:46.176 --> 00:08:49.518]  If you tabulate all of them together, it's got to be in the hundreds.
[00:08:49.518 --> 00:08:52.499]  Yesterday it was 19 booked, confirmed arrests.
[00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:59.122]  But if you look at all the arrests and all the articles I have in counties and cities all over Florida, it is in the hundreds.
[00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:05.425]  But the police have been doing a pretty good job, along with citizens clamping down on it very, very quickly.
[00:09:05.425 --> 00:09:07.626]  Anarchy in the streets after Hurricane Irma.
[00:09:07.626 --> 00:09:11.148]  Freeze prisoners!
[00:09:11.148 --> 00:09:12.229]  Freeze prisoners!
[00:09:13.246 --> 00:09:14.787]  And sparks mass looting.
[00:09:14.787 --> 00:09:18.288]  There's your headline out of the Metro show.
[00:09:18.288 --> 00:09:23.111]  We're going to be chronicling all of this coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:09:23.111 --> 00:09:39.339]  Notice that people that cover the looting are being called racist because when you look at the videos from the Caribbean to Florida, it is to a person, to a person, black folks.
[00:09:40.376 --> 00:09:45.680]  Florida looting crackdown is white supremacy, claims author Sarah Jaffe.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.102]  That's Fox News.
[00:09:48.102 --> 00:09:57.390]  So, Dan Bongino, former Secret Service agent, New York cop, says, yes, now it's apparently racist if you point a camera at who's committing a crime.
[00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.931]  Now, think about this.
[00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:02.174]  That scumbag that went into that black church last year,
[00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:08.382]  Roof and shot and killed nine people.
[00:10:08.382 --> 00:10:11.845]  The media said all white people were guilty for that.
[00:10:11.845 --> 00:10:13.126]  No, we're not.
[00:10:13.126 --> 00:10:23.998]  And if a minority of black people have been culturally trained and taught to go out and loot and rob during a crisis, you don't blame the majority of black folks either.
[00:10:23.998 --> 00:10:26.020]  But you certainly don't blame any group.
[00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:34.632]  For what other folks do, but you've got to ask, why is it in the LA riots, you name it, predominantly black folks?
[00:10:34.632 --> 00:10:52.518]  And it's because culturally, it was sold as a form of rebellion in the 50s and 60s by communists, teaching through agitator propaganda that going out and looting and stealing and killing white people is an act of rebellion and revolution.
[00:10:52.518 --> 00:10:56.699]  We've had him on the show before, the head of the Black Panther Party, New Black Panther Party, Houston.
[00:10:58.134 --> 00:10:59.635]  He's been in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:10:59.635 --> 00:11:00.175]  You can search it.
[00:11:00.175 --> 00:11:03.198]  It's saying, don't loot in the black area.
[00:11:03.198 --> 00:11:04.598]  Go loot in the white area.
[00:11:04.598 --> 00:11:05.439]  Go rob.
[00:11:05.439 --> 00:11:10.943]  Go mug white people as an act of resistance.
[00:11:10.943 --> 00:11:21.910]  So this is the systemic cultural racism that's being pushed by the left and the Ford Foundation and the universities where they say, oh, we're going to have a weekend with no white people at the college.
[00:11:22.998 --> 00:11:30.060]  We're going to have no white people allowed on the Commons area this weekend to teach you about discrimination.
[00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:41.502]  When only less than 1% of descendants of this country's family ancestors had slaves and most white people didn't get here till after the Civil War and have no connection to it.
[00:11:41.502 --> 00:11:48.644]  A lot of them came from Eastern Europe and Western Europe where they were still serfs, sharecroppers, tied to the land, slaves.
[00:11:50.247 --> 00:11:56.008]  They'll be locked up in the stocks and whipped if they didn't do their work, just like black slaves.
[00:11:56.008 --> 00:12:03.470]  There were some areas of Germania, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, that didn't end slavery in Germany until the 1880s.
[00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.911]  What?
[00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:05.451]  Let me test my memory.
[00:12:05.451 --> 00:12:11.392]  When was serfdom abolished in the final states in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire?
[00:12:11.392 --> 00:12:11.492]  1882.
[00:12:11.492 --> 00:12:12.313]  Look it up.
[00:12:12.313 --> 00:12:13.693]  Let's see if my memory serves.
[00:12:13.693 --> 00:12:17.214]  When was serfdom abolished in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire?
[00:12:19.075 --> 00:12:19.135]  1880s.
[00:12:19.135 --> 00:12:20.556]  Let's see if my memory serves.
[00:12:20.556 --> 00:12:21.296]  I think it's 1882.
[00:12:21.296 --> 00:12:26.999]  And then it was illegally carried out somewhere until, I think, 1890.
[00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:31.421]  But, but... I mean, the point is, that's never taught.
[00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:32.542]  There it is.
[00:12:32.542 --> 00:12:35.503]  And the Austrian Empire, Serfdom was abolished in 1781.
[00:12:35.503 --> 00:12:38.405]  Serfdom, Kaffei, continued until 1848.
[00:12:38.405 --> 00:12:40.146]  Serfdom was abolished in Russia in the 1860s.
[00:12:40.146 --> 00:12:41.526]  And the United Nations, 1956.
[00:12:43.126 --> 00:12:47.669]  Supplementary Convention on Abolition of Slavery also prohibits serfdom as a form of slavery.
[00:12:47.669 --> 00:12:49.430]  Okay, well that's a general Wikipedia.
[00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:57.134]  If you go to the last... What was the last Germanic kingdom, because they were all little states, to abolish serfdom?
[00:12:57.134 --> 00:12:57.995]  And it was in the 1880s.
[00:12:57.995 --> 00:13:03.798]  They had to have a big, almost a war over it, just to stop it.
[00:13:03.798 --> 00:13:08.981]  But again, people don't know this is going on, that Russia didn't abolish it until 1860.
[00:13:10.404 --> 00:13:11.985]  They don't understand that.
[00:13:11.985 --> 00:13:15.647]  They just think it's something going on in America.
[00:13:15.647 --> 00:13:17.449]  Slavery is still happening in Africa.
[00:13:17.449 --> 00:13:20.270]  It's still happening in the Middle East in some areas.
[00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.352]  They still have sex slaves in the Middle East.
[00:13:22.352 --> 00:13:24.253]  They're called harems.
[00:13:24.253 --> 00:13:28.416]  You always hear about women getting tricked to fly over to Saudi Arabia and they never come back.
[00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:31.217]  They get chained up in a sex dungeon.
[00:13:31.217 --> 00:13:33.599]  Then they get killed.
[00:13:33.599 --> 00:13:34.760]  But that's okay.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:39.623]  Just beat America and the West over the head, telling everybody that we invented slavery.
[00:13:40.865 --> 00:13:44.247]  You know who the Romans' favorite slaves were?
[00:13:44.247 --> 00:13:47.109]  People out of Gaul and people out of Germania.
[00:13:47.109 --> 00:13:49.971]  And in all those areas, they were the slaves being brought in.
[00:13:49.971 --> 00:13:51.372]  Not Africans.
[00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:54.974]  There have been more white slaves in European history than there have been black slaves.
[00:13:54.974 --> 00:13:58.477]  And I'm not defending any of it, but I didn't have anything to do with it!
[00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:04.434]  If my great-great-granddaddy was a murderer, which he wasn't, I'm not guilty of that.
[00:14:04.434 --> 00:14:06.976]  If my daddy killed somebody, I'm not guilty.
[00:14:06.976 --> 00:14:13.139]  If your daddy does something wrong, you're not guilty for what your mama did!
[00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:17.442]  But you've got people getting totally, absolutely brainwashed.
[00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:33.628]  To sit there and to believe that they have a right to go out and engage in these type of activities, and they don't.
[00:14:33.628 --> 00:14:34.889]  That's the bottom line.
[00:14:34.889 --> 00:14:38.912]  And if you look at where serfdom got abolished first, it was Christian countries.
[00:14:38.912 --> 00:14:42.476]  But see, I'm cursed with actually having facts, so let's go over it.
[00:14:43.646 --> 00:14:45.209]  This is on Infowars.com.
[00:14:45.209 --> 00:14:47.973]  It's on Newswars.com.
[00:14:47.973 --> 00:14:49.356]  A Dan Lyman article.
[00:14:49.356 --> 00:14:53.683]  Bandits terrorizing Virgin Islands after governor seized private arms.
[00:14:53.683 --> 00:14:54.945]  I remember last week.
[00:14:55.779 --> 00:15:07.403]  I remember seeing the headlines that the Virgin Islands had seized private arms from private hunting clubs and people's private homes that had registered them under laws passed more than a decade ago.
[00:15:07.403 --> 00:15:15.786]  So in the emergency, they said, turn your guns in, and the law-abiding citizens turned their guns in.
[00:15:15.786 --> 00:15:16.887]  And then what happened?
[00:15:16.887 --> 00:15:20.468]  The criminals went absolutely crazy.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.041]  Reports are exploding now from the U.S.
[00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:34.365]  Virgin Islands that armed marauders are looting and robbing residents in the chaos following Hurricane Irma.
[00:15:34.365 --> 00:15:42.769]  Days after, USVI Governor Keith Mapp ordered the National Guard to seize farms and weapons before the storm.
[00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:43.969]  That is a close quote!
[00:15:43.969 --> 00:15:45.150]  That was an order issued!
[00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.230]  Remember Katrina?
[00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:50.612]  I remember when I first was getting reports during Katrina.
[00:15:51.465 --> 00:15:53.747]  That they were confiscating guns all over the city.
[00:15:53.747 --> 00:16:00.453]  The media said I was a conspiracy theorist because they wanted to see if they could get away with giving the military the order.
[00:16:00.453 --> 00:16:03.515]  And then if they could contain the information and control it.
[00:16:03.515 --> 00:16:05.477]  But then people started complaining.
[00:16:05.477 --> 00:16:10.962]  News crews started showing the gun confiscation of people in their high and dry homes protecting their property.
[00:16:10.962 --> 00:16:16.707]  And so they had the police chief come out and say, quote, all the firearms will be taken.
[00:16:16.707 --> 00:16:18.508]  No one will be allowed to be armed.
[00:16:19.409 --> 00:16:21.590]  If you have them, you will turn them in.
[00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.251]  We're coming in your house and you must evacuate.
[00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:37.256]  And they went into the big, rich, dry areas under Homeland Security, bipartisanly, with the FBI leading it, and stole hundreds of thousands of firearms.
[00:16:37.256 --> 00:16:41.057]  Looters armed with machetes, guns, ransacked hotels in St.
[00:16:41.057 --> 00:16:42.698]  Martin after Hurricane Irma.
[00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:51.736]  So, the British possessions, the US possessions, the French possessions, they're all getting robbed.
[00:16:51.736 --> 00:16:55.119]  You survived Irma, but now you're in a civil war.
[00:16:55.119 --> 00:16:58.862]  That's the headlines we just had on screen.
[00:16:58.862 --> 00:17:01.724]  Why is there an instinct in government to take our guns?
[00:17:01.724 --> 00:17:10.911]  But let's roll some of the footage from Fort Lauderdale, and Miami, and all the other footage that's coming out for TV viewers, and from all over the Caribbean as well,
[00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:29.539]  Of the looting that's going on, and then if you point out that in Fort Lauderdale and Miami and in Orlando that every person looting is black, you're racist.
[00:17:29.539 --> 00:17:37.825]  In fact, they're even saying showing it is racist, or other leftist groups are spitting it that, well, they need supplies.
[00:17:37.825 --> 00:17:42.769]  What, you need nine pairs of size 12 Nike tennis shoes?
[00:17:44.881 --> 00:17:52.706]  It's also part of the sports brainwashing culture, where you're nobody if you don't have the $300 pair of tennis shoes.
[00:17:52.706 --> 00:17:55.587]  It's nothing but status.
[00:17:55.587 --> 00:18:02.852]  Nothing wrong with a good pair of tennis shoes, but it's disgusting to see people robbing, stealing, and doing this.
[00:18:02.852 --> 00:18:06.094]  And if you saw nothing but white people
[00:18:07.168 --> 00:18:17.917]  Running around robbing and marauding and in many areas with guns and machetes and everything else, you would hear collectively that whites are the devil, that whites are inherently bad.
[00:18:17.917 --> 00:18:19.918]  In fact, it gets worse.
[00:18:19.918 --> 00:18:26.484]  This isn't just an attack on the West or white people by the globalists to create division.
[00:18:26.484 --> 00:18:31.948]  Targeting low-income people that are susceptible to getting into tribalism and brainwashing.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:38.364]  Because all poor groups are more susceptible towards racism and tribalism, and the Democrats are manipulating it.
[00:18:38.364 --> 00:18:59.440]  We have Dianne Feinstein and people of her ilk, the Michael Moores of the world, coming out and saying, if you're a Christian, if you're an evangelical,
[00:19:00.627 --> 00:19:08.709]  If you are a Mormon, if you are a Catholic, you can't be trusted in the judiciary.
[00:19:08.709 --> 00:19:10.890]  Those clips are coming up after the break.
[00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:22.893]  Can you imagine if someone said to someone like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who's Jewish, can you be a judge because you're Jewish and you're Jewish dogma?
[00:19:22.893 --> 00:19:24.814]  Or saying it to a Hindu or a Buddhist.
[00:19:27.335 --> 00:19:30.939]  Feinstein's anti-Catholic questions are an outrage.
[00:19:30.939 --> 00:19:48.217]  It shows you, that's Bloomberg, it shows you the mindset though on Capitol Hill and in California, the anti-Christian venom is so extravagant that they think it's safe to, and it's not just her, I have clips of three senators
[00:19:49.409 --> 00:19:57.626]  All attacking this judge set to go to a higher level court viciously for being a Catholic.
[00:19:58.928 --> 00:20:00.829]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:20:00.829 --> 00:20:04.050]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.650]  Savory and delicious.
[00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.491]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:20:08.491 --> 00:20:09.151]  Awesome.
[00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:12.232]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.

[00:20:18.574 --> 00:20:20.014]  Or warm and served.
[00:20:20.014 --> 00:20:22.055]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:24.016]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[00:20:58.854 --> 00:21:00.836]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:21:00.836 --> 00:21:06.141]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:07.743]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:21:07.743 --> 00:21:16.091]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:21.777]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:21:21.937 --> 00:21:23.758]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:21:23.758 --> 00:21:25.920]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.444]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:21:30.444 --> 00:21:32.625]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:40.432]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:21:41.032 --> 00:21:41.533]  We're good to go.

[00:22:07.519 --> 00:22:08.720]  That's a tall order.

[00:22:13.463 --> 00:22:16.325]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[00:22:16.325 --> 00:22:17.146]  That's true.
[00:22:17.146 --> 00:22:21.669]  But you can have tax-free access to use your life insurance while you're alive.

[00:22:30.374 --> 00:22:31.154]  Not true.
[00:22:31.154 --> 00:22:32.995]  Actually, you are what you can absorb.
[00:22:32.995 --> 00:22:36.936]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?
[00:22:36.936 --> 00:22:38.037]  Introducing Protovite.

[00:23:34.686 --> 00:23:36.967]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.

[00:23:49.609 --> 00:23:51.249]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[00:24:08.209 --> 00:24:26.623]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24:26.623 --> 00:24:35.870]  We've got a lot of really serious news to cover, but one of the top stories out there right now is that real Alex Jones on Twitter
[00:24:37.043 --> 00:24:40.148]  And viewer discretion is advised.
[00:24:40.148 --> 00:24:46.479]  We're putting it out, obviously, only so people can see the horrible thing that Ted Cruz has done.
[00:24:46.479 --> 00:24:48.983]  Senator Ted Cruz has tweeted out some hardcore porn.
[00:24:50.215 --> 00:24:55.078]  Of course, he's probably going to get in a lot of trouble because it's not gay porn or child porn.
[00:24:55.078 --> 00:25:03.142]  It's just good old-fashioned healthy women, but I'm not a hypocrite and I'm not a Pharisee, folks.
[00:25:03.142 --> 00:25:07.104]  I'm not a big purveyor or connoisseur of things like that.
[00:25:07.104 --> 00:25:08.165]  I like the real world.
[00:25:08.165 --> 00:25:10.606]  I'm not into virtual stuff, but here's the deal.
[00:25:10.606 --> 00:25:12.067]  He's tweeted out some hardcore porn.
[00:25:12.907 --> 00:25:36.690]  to his three million followers from sexual post and I have reviewed the material and I hope this doesn't destroy him because he does a lot of good up there but he does kind of put on the whole holier-than-thou attitude and there's been reports of porn before and him connected to the
[00:25:37.705 --> 00:25:41.791]  You know, different groups and organizations and people that are involved in the production of it.
[00:25:41.791 --> 00:25:47.179]  So, College Roommate really wants us to know that Ted Cruz is a serial masturbator.
[00:25:47.179 --> 00:25:48.440]  That is the report.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.644]  We're tweeting that out on Real Alex Jones.
[00:25:52.278 --> 00:25:56.060]  Because I need some humor here with all the serious news.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:10.486]  In fact, I'm going to come back and get into Dianne Feinstein, who looks like... I'm serious, I was watching the clips this morning of her yesterday grilling this federal judge and saying, you're a Catholic, you have such extreme dogma, you know, can you be on the bench?
[00:26:10.486 --> 00:26:13.587]  It's so bigoted.
[00:26:13.587 --> 00:26:16.008]  It's so out of touch.
[00:26:16.008 --> 00:26:19.190]  But Frankenstein doesn't get it because he's in her own little Hollywood bubble.
[00:26:20.126 --> 00:26:25.807]  I'm serious, Dianne Feinstein is the most masculine looking woman I've ever seen.
[00:26:25.807 --> 00:26:30.928]  She's got a head just like Frankenstein.
[00:26:30.928 --> 00:26:35.569]  I mean, if you look up at her when she's on the dais and she's talking, she looks like Frankenstein.
[00:26:35.569 --> 00:26:41.210]  I'm not against her because she looks like Frankenstein, but she's just a weirdo.
[00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.510]  But, I digress.
[00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.991]  Very hateful, very, very serious, and
[00:26:49.753 --> 00:27:00.518]  What you gotta understand, and what nobody else is covering, at least from what I've seen, is that there were two other senators that said stuff just as bad!
[00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:05.740]  So that's coming up in the next segment, but let's get back to Ted Cruz.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:13.384]  I probably got ten different staffers that are on my Twitter, Real Alex Jones, so they can retweet stories and feeds.
[00:27:13.384 --> 00:27:15.365]  Paul Watson's on my Twitter, I'm on his Twitter.
[00:27:16.476 --> 00:27:30.261]  But if somebody tweeted, because this happened I guess last night, if somebody tweeted porn on my Twitter, I'd find out about it and I'd say, we discovered who did it, they've been fired.
[00:27:30.261 --> 00:27:34.082]  Or they'd get in trouble or whatever, or you know, somebody did it, it's an accident.
[00:27:35.964 --> 00:27:40.786]  Because I've accidentally deleted tweets, I've sent tweets before, stuff I didn't mean to.
[00:27:40.786 --> 00:28:00.274]  It'd be like some random story about a volcano I accidentally tweeted like a month ago because I was looking at that story, sending it to the crew, thought I was pasting it in to a text message and was putting it into a tweet, you know, not paying attention, literally sitting there in a grocery store parking lot, you know, with my kids getting buckled into the car and I was sending out a tweet on accident.
[00:28:01.394 --> 00:28:13.663]  That may be what it is from Ted Cruz, but the fact that... I was just looking during the break, have we gotten a response from Ted Cruz on tweeting out Reality Kings?
[00:28:13.663 --> 00:28:20.368]  I guess his fantasy is the wife comes home and catches you with another woman and then the wife gets involved.
[00:28:21.257 --> 00:28:25.299]  Because that's, I guess, what Ted Cruz is looking at and watching.
[00:28:25.299 --> 00:28:31.401]  The problem here is that, again, we haven't had the repudiation from Ted Cruz.
[00:28:31.401 --> 00:28:33.122]  That someone hacked into his Twitter.
[00:28:33.122 --> 00:28:34.683]  Remember what Weiner said?
[00:28:34.683 --> 00:28:45.888]  Remember Weiner said that somebody hacked into... It was his Twitter, and it was all over, just sending out the sexting pictures, and pictures of him standing naked in front of the mirror?
[00:28:45.888 --> 00:28:48.349]  I mean, do we have another Anthony Weiner on our hands?
[00:28:51.161 --> 00:28:54.524]  Oh yeah, Kirk Eichenwald, the tentacle porn.
[00:28:54.524 --> 00:28:58.528]  That's where monsters and goblins rape and murder men, women, and children.
[00:28:58.528 --> 00:29:01.991]  But it's not illegal because it's anime.
[00:29:01.991 --> 00:29:03.752]  And then he had that on his screen.
[00:29:03.752 --> 00:29:06.094]  He's a big, I guess, TV contributor to...
[00:29:08.114 --> 00:29:08.735]  We're good to go.
[00:29:24.204 --> 00:29:32.746]  I had seen one image years ago or something on Facebook of like alien from the movie Aliens raping a woman and ripping her head off.
[00:29:32.746 --> 00:29:34.966]  And I thought, you know, I really think this is disgusting.
[00:29:34.966 --> 00:29:37.127]  I didn't know that was known as tentacle porn.
[00:29:37.127 --> 00:29:40.147]  But what does it surprise you that that's what these guys are into?
[00:29:40.147 --> 00:29:42.068]  They want power over people.
[00:29:42.068 --> 00:29:45.209]  So is it a good thing Ted Cruz just likes women?
[00:29:45.209 --> 00:29:46.369]  I mean, in this corrupt age?
[00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:48.290]  I mean, is that a plus?
[00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:49.550]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:51.151]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.151 --> 00:29:54.754]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.907 --> 00:30:02.009]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:30:02.009 --> 00:30:04.331]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[00:30:04.331 --> 00:30:05.392]  Why we have them.
[00:30:05.392 --> 00:30:08.775]  Why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them.
[00:30:08.775 --> 00:30:14.281]  And why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[00:30:14.281 --> 00:30:17.824]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment
[00:30:17.964 --> 00:30:21.307]  Must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[00:30:21.307 --> 00:30:32.036]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[00:30:32.036 --> 00:30:35.699]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:44.727]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[00:30:44.727 --> 00:30:47.389]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:50.252]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth.
[00:30:50.252 --> 00:30:56.838]  It protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[00:30:56.838 --> 00:30:59.361]  This is a small excerpt from Charlton Heston.
[00:30:59.941 --> 00:31:01.823]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:01.823 --> 00:31:03.844]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:03.844 --> 00:31:06.647]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:06.647 --> 00:31:12.832]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:12.832 --> 00:31:22.020]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.303]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[00:31:25.543 --> 00:31:29.546]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:29.546 --> 00:31:37.572]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:37.572 --> 00:31:38.653]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:39.757 --> 00:31:43.680]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.262]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:47.262 --> 00:31:53.967]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:53.967 --> 00:31:58.170]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:33:21.653 --> 00:33:31.203]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:31.203 --> 00:33:37.269]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.186 --> 00:33:44.588]  Alright, I'm gonna get into the latest on Hurricane Irma, the looting and rioting going on all over the Caribbean, and the U.S.
[00:33:44.588 --> 00:33:59.774]  Virgin Islands, British Virgin Islands, French Islands as well, and a lot of it happening in Florida, and the fact that Florida looting crackdown is white supremacy, that's Fox News reporting that that's what the left is saying.
[00:34:01.127 --> 00:34:09.176]  Now this is a big controversy and the reason I'm going to weigh into it is it's very illustrative of hypocrisy.
[00:34:09.176 --> 00:34:20.408]  Last night someone on Ted Cruz's Twitter account, 3 million followers, tweeted out Reality King's porn, straight porn, of I guess a girlfriend coming home to the house
[00:34:21.329 --> 00:34:22.249]  I'm serious when I say this.
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:50.166]  They're making all these jokes that Ted Cruz has now damaged the credibility of the porn industry.
[00:34:50.166 --> 00:34:55.593]  That is their Hollywood exploitive joke.
[00:34:55.593 --> 00:35:03.543]  And there's also the joke that one of my crew made that at least these are good-looking women that he tweeted out, not to be mean or anything, but the woman that
[00:35:04.378 --> 00:35:07.900]  Anthony Weiner was sexting the underage girl.
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.442]  Looks like Ted Cruz.
[00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:13.084]  So there's a lot of weird connections here.
[00:35:13.084 --> 00:35:15.085]  But the big issue is this.
[00:35:15.085 --> 00:35:21.769]  He did not tweet out images of his naked body out to folks like Weiner did.
[00:35:21.769 --> 00:35:26.972]  He did not call an underage girl and try to set her up for sex.
[00:35:26.972 --> 00:35:29.054]  And he did not tweet out child porn.
[00:35:30.472 --> 00:35:32.773]  And he didn't tweet out any other kind of porn.
[00:35:32.773 --> 00:35:35.635]  That's probably why he's gonna get in big trouble.
[00:35:35.635 --> 00:35:39.057]  Because he committed the crime of heterosexuality.
[00:35:39.057 --> 00:35:43.399]  Now, we're not sure that he did this.
[00:35:43.399 --> 00:35:51.103]  One of his staffers, one of his crew was probably going through it, but how do you hit like and tweet on something?
[00:35:51.103 --> 00:35:57.607]  There's a couple buttons you gotta hit, and I think somebody thought they were on their personal account and tweeted this out.
[00:35:57.607 --> 00:35:59.548]  And I don't think Ted Cruz did this.
[00:36:00.603 --> 00:36:10.910]  Though his roommate and others say he is a porn addict and also was, pun intended, a master debater.
[00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:17.614]  He is a master debater, but his roommate says he was the other type of master.
[00:36:17.614 --> 00:36:25.999]  So we're going to be discussing all of this more coming up, because quite frankly, I need a good laugh with how serious some of the news is.
[00:36:25.999 --> 00:36:29.582]  But I don't think Ted Cruz should
[00:36:31.667 --> 00:36:36.028]  Get thrown under the bus for this, or most of us here are hypocrites.
[00:36:36.028 --> 00:36:40.930]  But expanding on that, quite frankly, that's not what I'm doing on the computer, that's not what I'm doing on Twitter.
[00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:47.572]  That would never happen to me, because I'm not doing that on my Twitter, unless one of my crew members did it.
[00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:55.694]  But you can be assured that, I think if that did happen on Twitter, it might be some of the same stuff Cruz is tweeting out.
[00:36:55.694 --> 00:36:57.675]  Okay, this is just too rich.
[00:36:57.675 --> 00:37:00.036]  We've got so much serious news to get to, though.
[00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:05.645]  Coming up, bandits terrorizing Virgin Islands after governor seized private arms.
[00:37:05.645 --> 00:37:06.725]  That's a U.S.
[00:37:06.725 --> 00:37:08.006]  governor of the Virgin Islands.
[00:37:08.006 --> 00:37:09.908]  He should be removed.
[00:37:09.908 --> 00:37:12.170]  French Caribbean, fear and looting grip tense St.
[00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:15.132]  Martins in wake of Hurricane Irma.
[00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:19.355]  Violence on Caribbean islands as food gone, looters run wild.
[00:37:19.355 --> 00:37:22.137]  Looting and lawlessness in the Caribbean after Irma barrels through.
[00:37:22.137 --> 00:37:26.081]  Again, all the video you've seen for days of Fort Lauderdale and
[00:37:26.912 --> 00:37:35.458]  Miami and now we've got a bunch of footage and photos here out of more of the central area of the state with Orlando.
[00:37:35.458 --> 00:37:39.881]  And of course the looting going on in the Caribbean as well.
[00:37:39.881 --> 00:37:45.905]  And I'm not kidding, as Fox News right here, the left is calling it racist if you show the video.
[00:37:45.905 --> 00:37:54.831]  Just like the left won't show crime statistics that on average every white person attacks a black person ten times less often than a black person attacks a white person.
[00:37:55.091 --> 00:37:59.715]  It's still a very small minority of black folks that are super racist out there attacking white people.
[00:37:59.715 --> 00:38:06.900]  It's just the facts are in that culturally the media has promoted, go out, knock a cracker in the head with a baseball bat.
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:13.226]  If you're gonna loot, the new Black Panther Party says all over the country, they say it in Austin, they say it in Houston, it's been on the news.
[00:38:13.226 --> 00:38:19.691]  Go out and loot in a white area.
[00:38:20.768 --> 00:38:30.737]  And so, let's admit, there's racism from whites, there's racism from blacks, and used to we had big institutional racism in some areas, and the KKK would go out and rob and steal and hurt black people.
[00:38:30.737 --> 00:38:32.158]  That was wrong!
[00:38:32.158 --> 00:38:33.479]  We said it was wrong.
[00:38:33.479 --> 00:38:36.722]  Now blacks are doing it, and it's not acceptable.
[00:38:36.722 --> 00:38:39.725]  It's culturally being pushed, and the racism is on the part.
[00:38:40.465 --> 00:38:46.389]  of the left pushing it, saying it's okay to go out and get yours, go out and loot, because it's acceptable.
[00:38:46.389 --> 00:38:51.252]  I mean, look at New Orleans, where we even had cops going through and stealing stuff at Walmart.
[00:38:51.252 --> 00:38:55.775]  And it was, again, because culturally, well, they're rich and, you know, we're poor.
[00:38:55.775 --> 00:39:00.398]  It's this class envy thing that you're not going to get anything in life unless you steal it.
[00:39:00.398 --> 00:39:06.101]  And then after Roger Stone leaves us with big breaking news, I'm going to play the videos here, because it wasn't just one senator.
[00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:08.203]  It has been three senators.
[00:39:09.625 --> 00:39:18.911]  We have Mazie Hirono attacking the judge, saying you can't be Catholic, you can't be Christian and be on the bench.
[00:39:18.911 --> 00:39:22.994]  We've got Dick Durbin saying it, and then of course Feinstein saying it.
[00:39:22.994 --> 00:39:35.061]  So, the anti-Christian fervor, whether you're Hispanic, black, white, Asian, old, young, that's the real global discrimination, is against Christianity, and against real religious freedom, and against Western civilization.
[00:39:35.061 --> 00:39:36.883]  We should all come together.
[00:39:36.883 --> 00:39:38.944]  Globalism is destroying the nation-state.
[00:39:40.396 --> 00:39:43.281]  Bringing in planetary government.
[00:39:43.281 --> 00:39:46.968]  Now, you get that Google ready before I go to Roger Stone, please.
[00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:51.697]  I want to show people the top Google search when you search McMaster here in just a moment.
[00:39:53.148 --> 00:40:02.750]  But before we go to Roger Stone of StoneColdTruth.com, and he now works with InfoWars as a contributor, writer, and co-host with Owen Schroyer weekdays, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:07.972]  Central, where he's a commentator, right here at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:40:07.972 --> 00:40:17.814]  And radio stations across the country now lining up, signing affiliate relations agreements to carry the war room, and real news, weekday mornings with David Knight, 8 a.m.
[00:40:17.814 --> 00:40:22.055]  to 11 a.m., kicking off the day right before this transmission that is the InfoWar.
[00:40:23.752 --> 00:40:30.680]  First off, we are running the biggest specials we've ever run week after week on different items.
[00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.305]  We had a big month and a half long mega sale of basically everything.
[00:40:34.305 --> 00:40:39.111]  But we're doing sales on individual products that are the biggest we've ever done.
[00:40:41.789 --> 00:40:48.375]  50% off all of the fluoride-free toothpaste products that we produce with the top company in the United States.
[00:40:48.375 --> 00:40:50.456]  Same folks that make it for Tom's of Maine.
[00:40:50.456 --> 00:40:51.697]  Super Blue.
[00:40:51.697 --> 00:40:53.199]  Adult and children's.
[00:40:53.199 --> 00:40:54.600]  Super Blue mouthwash.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.701]  Dr. Jones approved.
[00:40:55.701 --> 00:40:56.622]  That's my dad.
[00:40:56.622 --> 00:40:57.963]  I'm not a doctor.
[00:40:57.963 --> 00:40:59.304]  But he helped work with the company to do it.
[00:40:59.304 --> 00:41:04.749]  With the iodine, with the coiled silver, in a concentrated big old bottle of the most amazing mouthwash.
[00:41:06.383 --> 00:41:07.824]  I like this type that we developed.
[00:41:07.824 --> 00:41:16.168]  I also like the Emerge Essentials, but the point is, it's all 50% off right now, and you support the broadcast.
[00:41:16.168 --> 00:41:23.331]  Sign up for AutoShip, get an additional 10% off, and then we never sell out because we hold back enough for whoever's on AutoShip.
[00:41:23.331 --> 00:41:30.875]  We sell all these products, but we don't make a lot of money on this, but it's really good for your teeth, and it's kind of a loss leader at this price, but
[00:41:32.276 --> 00:41:39.121]  We want you to see how great these products are so that you can experience them for yourself.
[00:41:39.121 --> 00:41:43.023]  Our entire line of super blue fluoride-free products now at 50% off.
[00:41:43.023 --> 00:41:47.526]  The new Z-Shield anti-heavy metal detoxifier, it's 40% off.
[00:41:47.526 --> 00:41:54.171]  Knockout, the amazing all-natural sleep aid with valerian root, deltryptophan, melatonin.
[00:41:54.171 --> 00:41:57.873]  It is unbelievably low price at 40% off.
[00:41:57.873 --> 00:42:00.255]  Alexa Pure Breeze, comparable units are $800 to $400.
[00:42:02.642 --> 00:42:05.424]  I even checked, some units I bought five years ago were almost $1,000.
[00:42:05.424 --> 00:42:11.009]  I'm about to shoot an ad in my house showing the old units that I bought versus the ones from Alexa Pure.
[00:42:11.009 --> 00:42:18.735]  Very same system, but more high-tech, newer, because of miniaturization and cost going down in manufacturing.
[00:42:18.735 --> 00:42:19.575]  $200!
[00:42:19.575 --> 00:42:22.558]  Clean air in your house is not a luxury, it's a necessity.
[00:42:24.071 --> 00:42:36.359]  I've got one in every room in this office, and this is a big complex, and I've got one in every room of my house, and it is so good to come out of the pollen and garbage outside, and the particulate, and to come inside and have this.
[00:42:36.359 --> 00:42:44.644]  It is a luxury that is a necessity, and that's why I'm so glad that the same folks that bring you Alexa Pure Water Filtration bring you Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:42:44.644 --> 00:42:47.946]  And we are the biggest seller of these, obviously, so thank you all for your support.

[00:42:49.927 --> 00:42:50.187]  And lastly,
[00:42:53.991 --> 00:42:56.272]  Please support all of our AM and FM affiliates.
[00:42:56.272 --> 00:42:57.652]  Become a local sponsor.
[00:42:57.652 --> 00:42:59.113]  Support the local sponsors.
[00:42:59.113 --> 00:43:00.273]  Call and thank the station.
[00:43:00.273 --> 00:43:01.414]  Tell people about it.
[00:43:01.414 --> 00:43:04.035]  Paint it on the side of your barn, the local station call letters.
[00:43:04.035 --> 00:43:05.635]  Pay for a billboard.
[00:43:05.635 --> 00:43:07.476]  Send the station 50 bucks a month.
[00:43:07.476 --> 00:43:17.360]  Whatever you do, everywhere, you've got to fight for the Infowar because we're winning, we're having a huge effect, we're changing the world together, but they're trying to shut us down.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.881]  And in the face of that, we're swimming upstream and still winning.
[00:43:20.881 --> 00:43:22.522]  But it is an uphill battle.
[00:43:22.522 --> 00:43:23.102]  Here's an example.
[00:43:24.577 --> 00:43:34.399]  Google admits, and it's come out in their own documents, that they try to delist InfoWars and try to block us because, in almost every search result, our stories, until about a year ago, were number one.
[00:43:34.399 --> 00:43:36.159]  Whatever the topic was.
[00:43:36.159 --> 00:43:39.760]  When you typed in info, InfoWars was the top thing.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:43.360]  And so they've been delisting us and other libertarian and other conservative groups.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.381]  But notice this story about McMaster.
[00:43:46.381 --> 00:43:51.382]  You type in McMaster, and you click Google All, or the entire web,
[00:43:52.369 --> 00:43:53.650]  He was shown to me right before the show.
[00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:57.031]  We're going to put that on screen for folks.
[00:43:57.031 --> 00:44:06.196]  You see that the top link is the story that we broke yesterday.
[00:44:06.196 --> 00:44:06.737]  Report.
[00:44:06.737 --> 00:44:10.919]  McMaster labeled Trump scary, a dope.
[00:44:10.919 --> 00:44:13.500]  And several of the links are our links at the top.
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.521]  Now why are they doing that?
[00:44:14.521 --> 00:44:20.824]  They're selectively letting that through because they think it discredits the entire administration and goes along with their fake narrative that he's got Alzheimer's.
[00:44:21.718 --> 00:44:32.721]  No, we said that because three people we talked to close to the President said he never has done this before, he's doing it at night now, we think something's going on, he doesn't drink, and it's not fatigue.
[00:44:32.721 --> 00:44:36.862]  And we said it so that the President can think about it if he hears about it and get his blood tested.
[00:44:36.862 --> 00:44:44.204]  But the big news we covered, the most important news, Keith Schiller, his bodyguard for close to three decades, his confidant,
[00:44:45.437 --> 00:44:52.002]  Trump didn't even know, we now learn, that he had resigned because he couldn't even get to Trump anymore.
[00:44:52.002 --> 00:44:54.944]  And Trump, quote, has been devastated by this.
[00:44:54.944 --> 00:45:01.129]  So the big news we wanted to get out, to see how disciplined the controlled corporate press is, didn't get out.
[00:45:01.129 --> 00:45:07.054]  All the other stuff got out, but not the big news that we want to get out, regardless of what you think.
[00:45:07.794 --> 00:45:10.356]  Trump's bodyguard is gone.
[00:45:10.356 --> 00:45:12.197]  He's totally isolated.
[00:45:12.197 --> 00:45:16.120]  And he is a kept person, to a great extent, if he's so surrounded.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.841]  That's not just command and control.
[00:45:17.841 --> 00:45:33.191]  If he's so surrounded, so controlled, that he can't even have his bodyguard, and his daughter can't even get in to see him, and they've got to write reports about what they talk to him about, and then the very people go on the news, like Kelly, and say, oh, don't worry, we don't let him get InfoWars or Breitbart.
[00:45:33.191 --> 00:45:35.372]  You know, we're controlling the info he gets.
[00:45:35.372 --> 00:45:37.494]  It's so condescending.
[00:45:38.895 --> 00:45:43.398]  And so we're replacing one deep state with Hillary for another deep state, and I don't like it.
[00:45:43.398 --> 00:45:45.659]  Roger Stone, thank you for joining us.
[00:45:45.659 --> 00:45:47.140]  Great to be here, Alex.
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:50.863]  Let's get into it.
[00:45:50.863 --> 00:45:55.786]  Well, first of all, I have to comment on the Ted Cruz item.
[00:45:55.786 --> 00:46:00.949]  You know, why do people take an instantaneous dislike to Ted Cruz?
[00:46:00.949 --> 00:46:02.110]  Well, they're just saving time.
[00:46:03.344 --> 00:46:07.647]  In this case, I have no criticism for Ted Cruz.
[00:46:07.647 --> 00:46:10.929]  I, myself, am a libertarian and a libertine.
[00:46:10.929 --> 00:46:12.930]  I'm not running for public office.
[00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:21.736]  The real sin here, it seems to me, if there is one, is that on the one hand, Ted tells us he's a devout evangelical Christian, and on the other hand, he appears to be
[00:46:22.476 --> 00:46:24.678]  Checking out porn on the Internet.
[00:46:24.678 --> 00:46:27.619]  Now, there's nothing wrong with watching porn on the Internet.
[00:46:27.619 --> 00:46:28.620]  This is a free country.
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.742]  We have the right to do that, if you choose to.
[00:46:31.742 --> 00:46:34.624]  You also have the right not to do it, if you don't choose to.
[00:46:34.624 --> 00:46:43.509]  But it's the hypocrisy that makes this a story, not the alleged actions by Mr. Cruz.
[00:46:43.509 --> 00:46:47.732]  That said, I want to break down exactly what you talked about here, Alex, because
[00:46:48.793 --> 00:46:53.457]  To a great extent, the mainstream media only carried half the story.
[00:46:53.457 --> 00:47:01.544]  We broke amazing news here yesterday at InfoWars, but they don't seem to understand the cause and effect.
[00:47:01.544 --> 00:47:04.447]  Keith Schiller, who is one of the finest men I have ever known,
[00:47:05.282 --> 00:47:05.722]  That's right.
[00:47:21.608 --> 00:47:24.390]  On the rally tour or in public.
[00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:29.933]  Keith Schiller, a man who's put his own life on the line to protect Donald Trump.
[00:47:29.933 --> 00:47:39.078]  It was Schiller who grabbed the guy, you may recall, who tried to vault onto the stage in Ohio and get at the president during the campaign.
[00:47:39.078 --> 00:47:43.661]  Schiller has been purged by McMaster.
[00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:44.121]  Why?
[00:47:44.121 --> 00:47:48.424]  Because he has a direct pipeline and access to the president.
[00:47:48.424 --> 00:47:50.725]  He carries out the president's orders.
[00:47:51.468 --> 00:47:56.573]  Keith Schiller is a man with no agenda other than the agenda of Donald Trump.
[00:47:56.573 --> 00:48:00.957]  No agenda other than the success of the Trump presidency.
[00:48:00.957 --> 00:48:17.252]  Now, separately, we at InfoWars have three solid individual sources who all tell us that in phone conversations with the president, that he was at some point slurring his words.
[00:48:18.274 --> 00:48:22.696]  Perhaps if this were one report, you would chalk that up to fatigue.
[00:48:22.696 --> 00:48:27.479]  He works very, very hard for the American people.
[00:48:27.479 --> 00:48:29.120]  But when three people repeat it,
[00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:34.292]  And we know that he doesn't drink at all, not even wine.
[00:48:34.292 --> 00:48:36.292]  We know he doesn't do drugs.
[00:48:36.292 --> 00:48:44.755]  He is not personally in favor of marijuana, even though he is a supporter of states' rights on the question.
[00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:49.617]  And that he has extraordinarily work ethic in terms of the hours.
[00:48:49.617 --> 00:48:54.338]  This behavior is inconsistent with everything we know about him.
[00:48:54.338 --> 00:48:56.199]  Now, when you connect these two facts,
[00:48:57.085 --> 00:49:04.249]  The possibility that he is being drugged or medicated by his handlers is more than entirely possible.
[00:49:04.249 --> 00:49:05.870]  It's not crazy.
[00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:07.792]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[00:49:07.792 --> 00:49:09.393]  It's not outrageous.
[00:49:09.393 --> 00:49:12.875]  It's entirely likely based on the evidence.
[00:49:12.875 --> 00:49:21.140]  What's sad about the mainstream media is they say, Oh, Alex Jones says the president's being drugged without telling people the backstory.
[00:49:21.693 --> 00:49:40.861]  The back story being, General Kelly's insane desire to get complete and total isolation of the President, so that no one he talks to, no one he sees, is outside the control of General Kelly and his handlers.
[00:49:40.861 --> 00:49:41.662]  Well, it's eerie.
[00:49:41.662 --> 00:49:48.945]  It's like something out of a horror movie where now his best friend, basically, his confidant of 30 years, the guy that he absolutely trusts, the guy that
[00:49:49.687 --> 00:49:57.714]  You know, brings him his fast food, you know, everything, checks everything, is now just gone, and that Trump didn't know that he'd done this.
[00:49:57.714 --> 00:50:00.376]  How did they get rid of him?
[00:50:00.376 --> 00:50:08.643]  Well, I'm told that Schiller was refused the opportunity to speak to the President about his dismissal.
[00:50:08.643 --> 00:50:14.749]  And that Kelly told the President that it was either Schiller or him.
[00:50:15.444 --> 00:50:34.456]  There was a very important New York Times piece roughly a week ago, I'm quoted in the piece, but that's not what's important, that made the case, and Glenn Thrush, the reporter I spoke to, made this case to me, that Trump needs Kelly more than Kelly needs Trump.
[00:50:34.456 --> 00:50:37.758]  I completely disagree with that.
[00:50:37.758 --> 00:50:43.262]  Donald Trump needs a chief of staff who understands the Trump revolution.
[00:50:44.429 --> 00:51:00.418]  understands how Trump was elected, understands the constituency that he appeals to, and that he now has to keep in place as a governing constituency, a governing consensus.
[00:51:00.418 --> 00:51:02.459]  That's what the President needs.
[00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:08.303]  Now, he also needs somebody who's organized, who understands government and how it works.
[00:51:08.303 --> 00:51:08.823]  Sure, sure.
[00:51:08.823 --> 00:51:11.645]  Not to interrupt you, Roger, but let's expand on this briefly.
[00:51:12.839 --> 00:51:19.842]  I mean, think of the attitude when you've got Kelly and his adjuncts on TV saying, we control his information.
[00:51:19.842 --> 00:51:22.142]  He goes with the last thing he's given.
[00:51:22.142 --> 00:51:24.563]  We've got him totally isolated.
[00:51:24.563 --> 00:51:28.045]  Don't worry, we've got the nuclear football in control.
[00:51:28.045 --> 00:51:31.126]  One of the generals never leaves town with the others.
[00:51:32.046 --> 00:51:33.627]  We're babysitting him.
[00:51:33.627 --> 00:51:41.494]  They're just totally like a bunch of old senile men buying into CNN, MSNBC, and all the rest of the hype.
[00:51:41.494 --> 00:51:44.637]  They don't get the country's broken with them.
[00:51:44.637 --> 00:51:46.619]  We're tired of it.
[00:51:46.619 --> 00:51:49.541]  We don't like seeing the president encircled.
[00:51:49.541 --> 00:51:52.444]  I don't want access to the president.
[00:51:52.444 --> 00:51:55.947]  I haven't even sit there and pushed to try to get him back on the show.
[00:51:55.947 --> 00:51:57.108]  I want cut taxes.
[00:51:57.768 --> 00:51:58.990]  I want sovereignty.
[00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:03.214]  I want to not import unvetted hordes of radical Muslims.
[00:52:03.214 --> 00:52:06.398]  I don't want to sexualize children.
[00:52:06.398 --> 00:52:08.380]  I want all the basic things Trump wants.
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:11.724]  I want him to have the advisory board investigating vaccine dangers.
[00:52:12.625 --> 00:52:14.146]  I want the Trump agenda I heard about.
[00:52:14.146 --> 00:52:16.348]  We've already gotten some of it, and it's been great.
[00:52:16.348 --> 00:52:23.675]  But more and more we see them cutting him off, slowing him down, and showing disdain, virtue signaling, in the media.
[00:52:23.675 --> 00:52:33.023]  And they're so command and control, and they're the generals, and they're the guys that'll save America, you know, they're the guys that know what to do, but none of us are even humans compared to them.
[00:52:33.023 --> 00:52:34.024]  Okay then, stop
[00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:43.709]  Shooting your mouths off, undermining the President and his agenda, so you get your butt kicked, or your butt kissed in New York and D.C.
[00:52:43.709 --> 00:52:44.809]  and all the rest of it.
[00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:52.513]  They are socially weak and are bowing down to the pressure and running down the President everywhere they can.
[00:52:52.513 --> 00:52:53.513]  A.K.A.
[00:52:53.513 --> 00:52:56.575]  look at the Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson.
[00:52:56.575 --> 00:53:02.958]  These people are running from the President, even as we get the best median income numbers in U.S.
[00:53:02.958 --> 00:53:03.358]  history.
[00:53:03.618 --> 00:53:04.279]  We're good to go.
[00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:22.372]  Flyover country elected Trump.
[00:53:22.372 --> 00:53:23.893]  Infowars elected Trump.
[00:53:23.893 --> 00:53:26.035]  We don't want to be in your filthy D.C.
[00:53:26.035 --> 00:53:27.877]  We don't want to be in your filthy L.A.
[00:53:27.877 --> 00:53:33.782]  We don't want to be in your filthy little red carpets and private jets and all you ugly dead peacocks.
[00:53:33.782 --> 00:53:34.623]  We're America.
[00:53:34.623 --> 00:53:35.684]  We're the red blood.
[00:53:35.684 --> 00:53:36.865]  We work the jobs.
[00:53:36.865 --> 00:53:38.326]  We pay the taxes.
[00:53:38.326 --> 00:53:39.828]  And we're the country.
[00:53:39.828 --> 00:53:40.728]  Not Hollywood.
[00:53:40.728 --> 00:53:41.749]  Not the globalists.
[00:53:41.749 --> 00:53:43.411]  Not the communist Chinese.
[00:53:43.411 --> 00:53:44.692]  Not special interests.
[00:53:44.692 --> 00:53:46.714]  And not some clique of generals either.
[00:53:48.905 --> 00:53:51.006]  Well, Alex, I think you're exactly right.
[00:53:51.006 --> 00:54:03.452]  This whole attitude is born of arrogance and entitlement, if you will, is born out of the fact that they have run the country for the last 30 years.
[00:54:03.452 --> 00:54:09.956]  The transition of power from the Bushes to the Clintons is seamless because they are the same people.
[00:54:09.956 --> 00:54:12.717]  Their appointees are the same people.
[00:54:12.717 --> 00:54:13.978]  Their globalist
[00:54:14.518 --> 00:54:16.779]  Anti-American mindset.
[00:54:16.779 --> 00:54:23.441]  And that's why we have we have the Clinton holdovers, the Obama holdovers, and all of them all lockstep blocking Trump right now.
[00:54:23.441 --> 00:54:31.404]  And that's why you've got these generals paying an all-lip service and going along with putting in more Soros people because they've been taking orders from these folks for 30 years!
[00:54:31.404 --> 00:54:32.564]  It's their bosses!
[00:54:32.564 --> 00:54:36.446]  Their bosses are George Soros and Hillary Clinton and they're still taking orders!
[00:54:37.637 --> 00:54:43.863]  Why else would the Trump Justice Department be fighting the release of Hillary's emails?
[00:54:43.863 --> 00:54:54.273]  Why else would the Trump State Department be fighting the Hungarian government to stop them from trying to throw George Soros out of the country?
[00:54:54.893 --> 00:54:59.957]  We have an Obama government with a few Trump appointees at the top.
[00:54:59.957 --> 00:55:03.259]  That's what currently exists in Washington.
[00:55:03.259 --> 00:55:08.262]  This is the greatest single danger to the President and to the Trump agenda.
[00:55:08.262 --> 00:55:15.307]  And the arrogance of those around the President that we know better.
[00:55:15.307 --> 00:55:20.130]  Again, I refer to the story we broke yesterday of General McMaster.
[00:55:21.653 --> 00:55:25.174]  Mike Cernovich reported this some months ago.
[00:55:25.174 --> 00:55:29.636]  He was teetering, teetering on holding on.
[00:55:29.636 --> 00:55:37.238]  The stories about his out-of-control drinking were ubiquitous in Washington and well-known in the White House.
[00:55:37.238 --> 00:55:45.581]  His career was saved when Priebus was thrown out and his new protector, General Kelly, was ensconced.
[00:55:45.581 --> 00:55:48.702]  This strengthened McMaster's hand.
[00:55:49.434 --> 00:55:59.257]  How does Mr. McMaster, General McMaster, justify the hiring of Fiona Hill at the NSC to handle Russia?
[00:55:59.257 --> 00:56:01.978]  Fiona Hill worked for George Soros.
[00:56:01.978 --> 00:56:08.860]  Fiona Hill hates Donald Trump, hates the Trump Doctrine, hates everything we are trying to do.
[00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:11.541]  Why does this woman have a White House pass?
[00:56:12.901 --> 00:56:16.902]  We go back a month ago, they said within two months Trump will be neutralized.
[00:56:16.902 --> 00:56:18.802]  I mean, is this the neutralization?
[00:56:18.802 --> 00:56:20.122]  Where just everyone's gone?
[00:56:20.122 --> 00:56:21.603]  The family can't see him?
[00:56:21.603 --> 00:56:22.943]  No one can see him?
[00:56:22.943 --> 00:56:28.484]  And then how did they get Trump maneuvered into this position where his best friend is gone?
[00:56:28.484 --> 00:56:30.265]  That sounds very concerning.
[00:56:30.265 --> 00:56:34.765]  And I mean, how else could they get this stubborn person to do that unless they are drugging him?
[00:56:34.765 --> 00:56:37.286]  Look at it this way, Alex.
[00:56:38.291 --> 00:56:39.953]  The president is the king.
[00:56:39.953 --> 00:56:41.414]  He's a good king.
[00:56:41.414 --> 00:56:44.497]  But right now he's a captive of the bad guys.
[00:56:44.497 --> 00:56:50.102]  They're keeping him isolated in the tower because they know he has good works in mind.
[00:56:50.102 --> 00:56:53.084]  And they want to undo what he wants for the people.
[00:56:53.084 --> 00:56:55.126]  And they're telling him, let's get into the blackmail.
[00:56:55.126 --> 00:56:56.207]  We didn't get into that yesterday.
[00:56:56.207 --> 00:56:57.709]  Let's get into the J. Edgar Hoover stuff.
[00:56:59.548 --> 00:57:14.860]  Yeah, look, I think that there are those who would bear false witness against the President, claim that he had inappropriate relationships or other matters of blackmail.
[00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:25.229]  I happen to know that there's nothing to these stories, but they're going to do anything necessary to try to control the President.
[00:57:25.229 --> 00:57:28.011]  When you are President of the United States,
[00:57:28.772 --> 00:57:30.574]  You live in a fishbowl.
[00:57:30.574 --> 00:57:39.764]  You're not going to have a girlfriend, or perhaps in the case of previous presidents, a boyfriend, because there's no way to conceal it.
[00:57:39.764 --> 00:57:41.326]  The world would know.
[00:57:41.326 --> 00:57:46.272]  There's no way to be discreet and be President of the United States.
[00:57:46.272 --> 00:57:49.916]  But I don't trust the deep staters to make crap
[00:57:51.717 --> 00:58:02.702]  Sure, well they put, they put, they put the PP, the PP dossier out.
[00:58:02.702 --> 00:58:04.323]  I mean, they put out all this fake stuff.
[00:58:04.323 --> 00:58:08.525]  They have all the fake lawsuits about him kidnapping little girls, it turned out it was fake names.
[00:58:08.525 --> 00:58:11.387]  Uh, cause they're trying to cover up the Jerry Epstein stuff that the Clintons have on them.
[00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:14.031]  That's exactly right.
[00:58:14.031 --> 00:58:17.252]  And by the way, most of those people have come forward and repented.
[00:58:17.252 --> 00:58:21.895]  In one case, there's evidence that the Clintons were paying them to say these false things.
[00:58:21.895 --> 00:58:25.797]  Donald Trump has never dallyed with underage girls.
[00:58:25.797 --> 00:58:27.678]  It's a lie.
[00:58:27.678 --> 00:58:29.279]  It's a fraud.
[00:58:29.279 --> 00:58:31.040]  But I think they'll use anything.
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.361]  In there, in there.
[00:58:49.497 --> 00:58:49.637]  I think?
[00:59:05.213 --> 00:59:08.095]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists, we're getting results and we're expanding in the face of
[00:59:34.711 --> 00:59:36.732]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:03.059 --> 01:00:13.861]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:00:13.861 --> 01:00:20.063]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[01:00:20.063 --> 01:00:25.064]  This is breaking on NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[01:00:25.064 --> 01:00:26.064]  Representative Franks,
[01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:38.336]  Awans seek immunity for significant disturbing testimony against Wasserman Schultz, confirming the reports we were putting out last week from our sources and others.
[01:00:38.336 --> 01:00:48.682]  The Daily Caller also was reporting it, that they had planted the laptop for police to find, obviously, and had written letters to the police and justice department.
[01:00:48.682 --> 01:00:51.164]  So they were looking for immunity, looking for safety.
[01:00:52.836 --> 01:01:02.024]  Looking for a way to give them the info, but then hide out in contact, but not be grabbed right away, knowing the power they had over the Justice Department.
[01:01:02.024 --> 01:01:04.306]  And now it's confirmed, InfoWars.com.
[01:01:04.306 --> 01:01:07.609]  What's the next shoe to drop?
[01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:17.898]  Because we just see the insane arrogance and corruption, even Dianne Feinstein saying Catholics aren't fit to serve in federal courts.
[01:01:17.898 --> 01:01:20.460]  I mean, the left has gone bonkers crazy.
[01:01:22.574 --> 01:01:24.355]  Roger?
[01:01:24.355 --> 01:01:49.373]  Well, in this particular case, Alex, I think it's important to note that Deborah Wasserman Schultz, after she was informed by the Capitol Police that the Awan brothers were under formal investigation for the stealing of both money and data, changed their classification within the House of Representatives computer system from consultant to employee
[01:01:50.236 --> 01:01:53.499]  To allow their unfettered access to the U.S.
[01:01:53.499 --> 01:01:57.662]  House of Representatives computer system to continue.
[01:01:57.662 --> 01:02:02.706]  That makes her an accessory in their crimes.
[01:02:02.706 --> 01:02:06.389]  And one can only assume that the U.S.
[01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:10.312]  Attorney in either Florida or in Washington, D.C.
[01:02:10.312 --> 01:02:11.793]  would wake up and understand
[01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:14.725]  That this is a real scandal.
[01:02:14.725 --> 01:02:16.406]  Russian collusion?
[01:02:16.406 --> 01:02:17.807]  That's nonsense.
[01:02:17.807 --> 01:02:20.348]  Or as we call it, the Russian collusion delusion.
[01:02:20.348 --> 01:02:25.912]  But two Pakistanis having unfettered access to the house computer?
[01:02:25.912 --> 01:02:31.216]  Neither one of whom seems to have extensive real IT experience?
[01:02:31.216 --> 01:02:34.698]  Was this a Pakistani intelligence operation?
[01:02:34.698 --> 01:02:41.123]  Was this an Islamic terrorist group of some kind or an affiliate?
[01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:44.252]  Where is the Washington Post?
[01:02:44.252 --> 01:02:46.273]  Where is the New York Times?
[01:02:46.273 --> 01:02:47.954]  Where is CNN?
[01:02:47.954 --> 01:02:49.615]  Where is CBS?
[01:02:49.615 --> 01:02:50.996]  No, who's covering this?
[01:02:50.996 --> 01:02:54.638]  Infowars.com, The Daily Caller.
[01:02:54.638 --> 01:02:58.980]  Alternative conservative media bringing you the real news, not the fake news.
[01:02:59.718 --> 01:03:04.380]  And of course, those are all the websites banned by General Kelly from the President.
[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:07.642]  I mean, people are saying, oh, the President's not a prisoner.
[01:03:07.642 --> 01:03:10.683]  We just control what magazines and articles he can read.
[01:03:10.683 --> 01:03:16.986]  That's exactly what you do to high-level security prisoners in maximum security.
[01:03:18.018 --> 01:03:19.579]  I mean, this is insane!
[01:03:19.579 --> 01:03:38.228]  The president is by increment being turned into a Chinese emperor in his forbidden city, and then these sycophants that are all around him wanting personal power through it are acting like those of us concerned are the ones that want into the White House and want into the president when they're the ones that have done it.
[01:03:38.228 --> 01:03:39.088]  I'm in Texas.
[01:03:39.088 --> 01:03:40.829]  I'm not in D.C.
[01:03:40.829 --> 01:03:43.230]  I don't need to go there to get the power.
[01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:45.511]  I'm transferring the power back to the states.
[01:03:45.511 --> 01:03:46.952]  Our listeners are doing that, Roger.
[01:03:48.413 --> 01:03:59.481]  Look, I think our obligation here, Alex, is to save the President, to help him understand exactly what's going on around him, and to preserve his agenda.
[01:03:59.481 --> 01:04:02.623]  We act out of loyalty to the President.
[01:04:02.623 --> 01:04:05.745]  We act out of affection for the President.
[01:04:05.745 --> 01:04:15.031]  We act out of total support for his agenda to transform this country and make it great again.
[01:04:15.031 --> 01:04:17.433]  The history will show, in the end,
[01:04:18.061 --> 01:04:26.933]  That the seminal event in terms of the deep stakes moves on the Trump administration is the fall of General Flynn.
[01:04:27.972 --> 01:04:37.414]  When General Flynn is dismissed on the recommendation of Jared Kushner, it opens the door for McMaster, Soros, and the bad guys.
[01:04:37.414 --> 01:04:37.894]  That's right.
[01:04:37.894 --> 01:04:39.595]  That was the drawbridge being lowered down.
[01:04:39.595 --> 01:04:44.536]  That was the string of the Christmas sweater that unraveled the whole deal.
[01:04:44.536 --> 01:04:50.197]  Wow, Roger Stone, you'll be on The War Room coming up today at 3 o'clock after this transmission.
[01:04:50.197 --> 01:04:51.377]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:51.377 --> 01:04:53.798]  We'll be right back with Jihad Watch.
[01:04:53.798 --> 01:04:55.138]  They've been banned on PayPal.
[01:04:56.588 --> 01:05:03.073]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:15.656]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in InfoWars live broadcasting.
[01:05:15.656 --> 01:05:18.198]  We are live weekdays from 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:05:18.198 --> 01:05:24.564]  Central at InfoWars.com slash show and this YouTube channel right here that you've landed on.
[01:05:24.564 --> 01:05:27.687]  Please subscribe to the channel for updates and notifications.
[01:05:27.687 --> 01:05:30.570]  You can follow us on Twitter at War Room Show.
[01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:34.152]  We are going to have the most powerful guests, the most powerful hosts.
[01:05:34.152 --> 01:05:39.314]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly, as well as taking your phone calls.
[01:05:39.314 --> 01:05:42.896]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[01:05:42.896 --> 01:05:45.817]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:47.098]  This is The War Room.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:02.467]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:06:02.467 --> 01:06:04.549]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:09.855]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:09.855 --> 01:06:13.600]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:17.142]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:06:17.142 --> 01:06:20.323]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:06:20.323 --> 01:06:24.205]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:06:24.205 --> 01:06:31.368]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:06:31.368 --> 01:06:37.491]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[01:06:37.671 --> 01:06:39.073]  Nano, silver, and more.
[01:06:39.073 --> 01:06:47.364]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[01:06:47.364 --> 01:06:55.675]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[01:06:56.849 --> 01:07:05.938]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:05.938 --> 01:07:14.346]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:14.346 --> 01:07:18.990]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:25.992]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:25.992 --> 01:07:33.153]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:33.153 --> 01:07:40.195]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:40.195 --> 01:07:44.676]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:44.676 --> 01:07:47.577]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion
[01:07:47.637 --> 01:07:47.898]  We're good.
[01:08:01.135 --> 01:08:10.804]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[01:08:10.804 --> 01:08:18.010]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:21.371 --> 01:08:23.912]  That's right, Austin is a model U.N.
[01:08:23.912 --> 01:08:27.314]  city and they say that they take their orders from the U.N.
[01:08:27.314 --> 01:08:29.735]  when they couldn't pass the carbon tax seven years ago.
[01:08:29.735 --> 01:08:32.296]  Remember, Schwarzenegger became the U.N.
[01:08:32.296 --> 01:08:45.061]  envoy and he said, he was leaving the governorship of California, he said, I will now go to the cities and we will bypass the states and the Congress and we will implement the United Nations program on climate carbon tax.
[01:08:45.061 --> 01:08:48.143]  And then we have the Strong Cities Initiative with Loretta Lynch.
[01:08:48.823 --> 01:09:00.947]  Just eight months ago when she was leaving office there as the Attorney General, she said we're going to have the UN advise us on our police departments.
[01:09:00.947 --> 01:09:05.409]  Then we have George Soros funding all of this in the WikiLeaks saying overthrow Israel.
[01:09:07.449 --> 01:09:25.479]  So finally Israel's come out and enlisted George Soros as basically a criminal organization like Hungary and others have done and then magically you see them trying to indict the Prime Minister there because his wife reportedly had government chefs cook dinner a couple times at government meetings at their house.
[01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:26.940]  Wow, I didn't know Prime Ministers couldn't have
[01:09:28.621 --> 01:09:30.201]  That's quite a crime, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:30.201 --> 01:09:46.650]  And again, regardless if you think about Netanyahu, Israel, any of this, there's a war on Israel, there's a war on Christianity, there's a war on free speech, there's a war on basic Western values of any type, and there's massive radical Islamic Muslim Brotherhood funding
[01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:58.095]  With McMaster up there and the rest of it, and Brennan converting to lobbyism, and the former FBI director taking radical Islam out of the terror database, and putting Christians number one on there.
[01:09:58.095 --> 01:10:13.343]  And then you get Dianne Feinstein coming out, and other senators, Dick Durbin and Mazzi Harano, saying, we don't know if you can be a Catholic with your conservative dogma and be on the bench.
[01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:14.563]  Wow!
[01:10:14.563 --> 01:10:15.764]  Imagine if they said that
[01:10:17.921 --> 01:10:19.881]  About any other religious group or organization.
[01:10:19.881 --> 01:10:24.643]  So it is, it's serious folks and the leftists are making their move.
[01:10:24.643 --> 01:10:28.143]  Speaking of that, let's play a clip here before we get to this article.
[01:10:28.143 --> 01:10:32.805]  PayPal bans conservative sites after Soros funded group attacked them.
[01:10:32.805 --> 01:10:34.605]  Well it's beyond that.
[01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:39.786]  As Matt Drudge warned here in the studio a year and a half ago, they want to put everybody in internet ghettos first.
[01:10:39.786 --> 01:10:42.307]  First shut us down economically and shut our speech down.
[01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:45.151]  Then they'll physically shut us down.
[01:10:45.151 --> 01:10:47.612]  This is how you always roll out tyranny.
[01:10:47.612 --> 01:10:48.912]  We're banned off Google Ads.
[01:10:48.912 --> 01:10:50.153]  We're banned off AdRoll.
[01:10:50.153 --> 01:10:51.694]  We're getting banned everywhere.
[01:10:51.694 --> 01:10:53.594]  My lawyers are saying we've got to sue.
[01:10:53.594 --> 01:10:54.915]  We'll probably win the cases.
[01:10:54.915 --> 01:10:55.795]  Here's the thing.
[01:10:55.795 --> 01:10:57.316]  Why don't they care now?
[01:10:57.316 --> 01:11:01.378]  They're doing bold stuff.
[01:11:01.378 --> 01:11:04.119]  They're doing bold things and it's crazy.
[01:11:04.119 --> 01:11:06.620]  Here's Dianne Feinstein shingling out
[01:11:08.413 --> 01:11:10.955]  A Christian judge with a great record.
[01:11:10.955 --> 01:11:19.802]  Again, this is the leftist vitriol of overthrow anything that's not atheist, I guess, but then they're allied with Islam.
[01:11:19.802 --> 01:11:21.083]  They throw gays off buildings.
[01:11:21.083 --> 01:11:22.284]  Here it is.
[01:11:22.284 --> 01:11:33.853]  When you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you.
[01:11:37.065 --> 01:11:46.660]  That's of concern when you come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for for years in this country.
[01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:52.411]  So you got the leftist Pope now pushing world government saying he's disgusted by Europe's Christian roots.
[01:11:52.411 --> 01:11:53.411]  That's a quote.
[01:11:53.411 --> 01:12:01.514]  Saying open up the borders, have the whole Islamic invasion that they now admit the Vice President of the EU says is to replace Europe with Muslims.
[01:12:01.514 --> 01:12:02.914]  And if you don't like that, you're racist.
[01:12:02.914 --> 01:12:03.414]  Racist?
[01:12:03.414 --> 01:12:05.655]  I don't want to live in Saudi Arabia or North Africa.
[01:12:07.415 --> 01:12:12.780]  You know, Libya, where they cut women's genitals off and women are kept in slave pits and sold on auction blocks.
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.903]  But again, the left and Linda Saucer, they can all fundraise.
[01:12:15.903 --> 01:12:17.544]  They can get money for the hurricane relief.
[01:12:17.544 --> 01:12:18.685]  That's okay.
[01:12:18.685 --> 01:12:21.628]  We're about to go to our guest, but I want to give you just today's background.
[01:12:21.628 --> 01:12:23.069]  Just what's happening today.
[01:12:23.069 --> 01:12:24.551]  Finnish police chief.
[01:12:24.551 --> 01:12:27.513]  Terrorists should be allowed in schools to expand tolerance.
[01:12:27.513 --> 01:12:29.956]  This is actually from the local newspaper.
[01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:37.959]  This is in mainstream news, he did a TV interview of a major city after a 22 year old Moroccan
[01:12:39.631 --> 01:12:42.153]  Stabbed 10 people, killing 2.
[01:12:42.153 --> 01:12:45.015]  They said, it's time to start restricting these people.
[01:12:45.015 --> 01:12:49.218]  And he said, on the contrary, even a terrorist can benefit from good learning.
[01:12:49.218 --> 01:12:55.262]  I might widen views or expand tolerance, responded the police chief, Taponen.
[01:12:55.262 --> 01:13:03.888]  And it goes on to say, a Finnish citizen expressed relief on Twitter that they didn't try to attack a school, given reports that he had multiple different attack plans.
[01:13:04.858 --> 01:13:11.726]  On the contrary, people need to be motivated to stay in school, whether it's a child or an adult, responded the superintendent, a police chief.
[01:13:11.726 --> 01:13:17.353]  He has been asked by another individual, as a police officer, you support terrorists being in our children's schools?
[01:13:17.353 --> 01:13:19.195]  He said, yes, I support terrorists.
[01:13:19.195 --> 01:13:22.379]  You cannot make up the Stockholm Syndrome of this.
[01:13:23.507 --> 01:13:27.769]  Strangely enough, it's just, I don't know what you call it.
[01:13:27.769 --> 01:13:43.298]  So let's go to our guest, who literally is being put into an internet ghetto for a Jihad watch that just shows the radical Islamists saying they're going to kill everybody, saying, teaching kids to suicide bomb, teaching them to blow up U.S.
[01:13:43.298 --> 01:13:44.759]  military.
[01:13:44.759 --> 01:13:47.281]  And then it's like, oh, I forgot, in Stockholm and other areas,
[01:13:48.151 --> 01:13:54.175]  They're bringing in former ISIS people and giving them preferential welfare and housing.
[01:13:54.175 --> 01:13:57.017]  So again, this is an alliance with the left.
[01:13:57.017 --> 01:14:03.221]  Something I heard David Horowitz and people, you know, say 15 years ago and I didn't believe because it sounded crazy.
[01:14:03.221 --> 01:14:05.142]  It's really here.
[01:14:05.142 --> 01:14:06.243]  It's here.
[01:14:06.243 --> 01:14:16.850]  So joining us is Robert Spencer of jihadwatch.org that had its PayPal blocked because George Soros, a literal Nazi collaborator who openly wants the overthrow of Israel,
[01:14:18.431 --> 01:14:20.952]  I mean, you talk about an international criminal.
[01:14:20.952 --> 01:14:24.694]  He gets to have his bank accounts, but Jihad Watch, they can't be on PayPal.
[01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:27.195]  And folks, if they can't be there, we're next.
[01:14:27.195 --> 01:14:29.876]  And it's already happening, being de-platformed.
[01:14:29.876 --> 01:14:31.897]  This is such a dangerous day.
[01:14:31.897 --> 01:14:34.518]  So I've set this up with just some of the background.
[01:14:34.518 --> 01:14:36.579]  Robert Spencer, this is so serious.
[01:14:36.579 --> 01:14:38.380]  If we don't hang together, we're going to hang separate.
[01:14:39.386 --> 01:14:40.967]  Oh, there's no doubt about it, Alex.
[01:14:40.967 --> 01:14:41.567]  Absolutely.
[01:14:41.567 --> 01:14:44.148]  And of course, it's not just PayPal, as you well know.
[01:14:44.148 --> 01:14:52.451]  Google searched for years because they were working on the basis of subject matter and the number of readers.
[01:14:52.451 --> 01:14:58.614]  If you search for Jihad, you would get Jihad Watch First, my website, because it's a news and commentary site about Jihad activity.
[01:14:59.014 --> 01:15:07.940]  But recently they have changed the way they do the Google searches so that nothing unfavorable about Islam comes up.
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:13.924]  If you search for Jihad or Sharia or Islam, you only get favorable results from Google now.
[01:15:14.761 --> 01:15:18.965]  And they're doing that to all of our stuff as well, and admitting they're doing it.
[01:15:18.965 --> 01:15:20.266]  We even got internal documents.
[01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:22.288]  So this is real racketeering.
[01:15:22.288 --> 01:15:27.894]  They operate as a utility in their own words, and then they have a monopoly, and they're openly blocking us.
[01:15:27.894 --> 01:15:28.915]  This is so dangerous.
[01:15:29.827 --> 01:15:30.887]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:30.887 --> 01:15:35.609]  They're using Charlottesville as their Reichstag fire moment to try to shut down all dissent.
[01:15:35.609 --> 01:15:39.231]  And of course, as you well know, it's not just PayPal, it's not just Google.
[01:15:39.231 --> 01:15:45.533]  In February, the readership to Jihadwatch referrals from Facebook and Twitter dropped 90%.
[01:15:45.533 --> 01:15:49.634]  They put in some kind of block so that the referrals just don't go through.
[01:15:49.634 --> 01:15:53.436]  So many people write me and say, I click on your links and they just don't work.
[01:15:53.436 --> 01:15:56.237]  It's what Facebook, and you know something else, Alex,
[01:15:56.637 --> 01:15:58.138]  There's a reason for this.
[01:15:58.138 --> 01:16:11.269]  The Facebook Vice President, Joel Kaplan, recently traveled to Pakistan, and he promised the Pakistani government that they would remove all material critical of Islam, which means counter-terror analysis that discusses the motives and goals of terrorists.
[01:16:11.269 --> 01:16:12.290]  You know, I forgot that.
[01:16:12.290 --> 01:16:13.190]  That's what's so frustrating.
[01:16:13.190 --> 01:16:14.431]  There's so much evidence.
[01:16:14.431 --> 01:16:21.337]  In fact, Facebook, Twitter, and others have been helping in Pakistan and Iran people that mildly criticize the government.
[01:16:21.337 --> 01:16:25.300]  They're ratting them out, giving their location, and some are being executed.
[01:16:26.072 --> 01:16:35.956]  Yes, and that includes people who commit blasphemy according to Islam, which in many cases in Pakistan is just Christians, and some Muslim comes up to them and says, do you think Muhammad is a prophet?
[01:16:35.956 --> 01:16:38.417]  And they say no, and they're accused of blasphemy.
[01:16:38.417 --> 01:16:40.918]  And this is what Facebook is aiding and abetting.
[01:16:40.918 --> 01:16:49.082]  They explicitly promised Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, the Interior Minister of Pakistan, that they would remove all anti-Islamic material from Facebook.
[01:16:49.588 --> 01:16:55.590]  Well, I'm going to be joining a class action suit against CNN, but I've been talking to top law firms.
[01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:57.011]  We'll win all these cases.
[01:16:57.011 --> 01:16:58.591]  The problem is it'll take years to litigate.
[01:16:58.591 --> 01:17:00.712]  But with you, it's so clear.
[01:17:00.712 --> 01:17:09.415]  You're put in a database by the Southern Poverty Law Center, funded by Soros, that's been caught with 60-plus million probably illegal money in offshore accounts.
[01:17:09.415 --> 01:17:10.376]  They are literally
[01:17:11.076 --> 01:17:16.985]  Literally involved in massive civil rights violations against you, trying to block a news organization as well.
[01:17:16.985 --> 01:17:20.950]  I mean, I don't think you have any course but to sue PayPal, to sue Google.
[01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:22.473]  I mean, we've got to start litigating.
[01:17:23.393 --> 01:17:24.533]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:24.533 --> 01:17:28.815]  The problem is there's a Communications Decency Act that Obama put in.
[01:17:28.815 --> 01:17:36.897]  Section 230 gives Facebook, Twitter, Google, all the social media giants, gives them immunity from that kind of challenge.
[01:17:36.897 --> 01:17:41.819]  But they're selectively enforcing it, so I think it still opens it up to a civil rights issue.
[01:17:41.819 --> 01:17:43.419]  I sure hope so, absolutely.
[01:17:43.419 --> 01:17:46.400]  But I think we have to challenge it every which way we can.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.521]  Sue the government to get that removed.
[01:17:48.521 --> 01:17:51.362]  Sue PayPal, Facebook, Google, all the rest of them.
[01:17:51.362 --> 01:17:52.462]  And let's expand on that.
[01:17:54.252 --> 01:17:57.653]  You see Trump being isolated and we see all this unfolding.
[01:17:57.653 --> 01:18:03.775]  I mean, there's just so many ways they're censoring us, so many ways.
[01:18:03.775 --> 01:18:05.456]  The censorship's not coming, it's here.
[01:18:05.456 --> 01:18:07.557]  What do we do?
[01:18:07.557 --> 01:18:13.859]  We have to, I think, somehow make it clear to Trump and even to the corrupt Republican establishment
[01:18:14.272 --> 01:18:18.696]  That the war on free speech is something they're going to have to pay attention to.
[01:18:18.696 --> 01:18:24.261]  That if they don't, then citizens are going to have to act themselves.
[01:18:24.261 --> 01:18:26.643]  I'm not talking about some kind of vigilante action.
[01:18:26.643 --> 01:18:32.988]  I just mean that we cannot give our votes anymore to politicians who are not on this issue.
[01:18:32.988 --> 01:18:37.412]  Google right now and Facebook and the rest of them, they hold more power than any government.
[01:18:37.412 --> 01:18:40.295]  And they are censoring more than the Soviet Union ever did.
[01:18:40.695 --> 01:18:51.639]  And if this isn't stopped, then Trump is going to lose any fragments of his base he has left, and everyone except those who push the hard left agenda are going to be completely choked off.
[01:18:51.639 --> 01:18:59.722]  We have to all act now and act in every possible way we can to turn this around, or you know where it's going to end up.
[01:18:59.722 --> 01:19:05.004]  As you say, first they take away the platforms, they take away our voice, and then they're going to come for us.
[01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:08.611]  And they say they're going to come for us.
[01:19:08.611 --> 01:19:13.554]  They say they're beating conservatives, Christians, people up everywhere they're attacking.
[01:19:13.554 --> 01:19:15.816]  It's super in vogue now to hate Jews.
[01:19:15.816 --> 01:19:17.457]  And I'm not just jumping on that bandwagon.
[01:19:17.457 --> 01:19:18.497]  It's true.
[01:19:18.497 --> 01:19:27.143]  And it's just, it's crazy that our own governments and systems are allied with the most orthodox forms of aggressive, cancerous Islam.
[01:19:28.103 --> 01:19:29.564]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:40.009]  And it seems as if what you have is two forces that hate America, that hate Judeo-Christian civilization, that hate Western values, and so they see each other as kindred.
[01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:42.691]  And also both have an authoritarian heart.
[01:19:42.691 --> 01:19:44.492]  The left is authoritarian at heart.
[01:19:44.492 --> 01:19:51.356]  Every time the hard left has come to power, it's been a reign of terror and the violent suppression of all dissent.
[01:19:51.356 --> 01:19:53.197]  And Islamic law is just the same way.
[01:19:54.017 --> 01:19:55.879]  Stan, let's talk about what we do when we come back.
[01:19:55.879 --> 01:19:56.679]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:19:56.679 --> 01:19:59.061]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:19:59.061 --> 01:20:07.087]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:20:07.087 --> 01:20:08.888]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:20:09.008 --> 01:20:12.672]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.

[01:20:21.741 --> 01:20:22.382]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:20:25.545 --> 01:20:26.385]  Anytime.
[01:20:26.385 --> 01:20:27.266]  Anyplace.
[01:20:27.266 --> 01:20:28.006]  Anywhere.
[01:20:28.006 --> 01:20:31.108]  Radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media.
[01:20:31.108 --> 01:20:31.668]  At home.
[01:20:31.668 --> 01:20:32.328]  At work.
[01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:33.148]  In the car.
[01:20:33.148 --> 01:20:34.669]  On smartphones.
[01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:37.831]  Over 90% of consumers still listen to radio every week.
[01:20:37.831 --> 01:20:43.493]  That makes choosing radio as a place to advertise your business one of the best decisions you can make.
[01:20:43.493 --> 01:20:50.136]  Email advertise at gcnlive.com and partner up with an experienced GCN representative.
[01:20:50.136 --> 01:20:52.637]  Advertise at gcnlive.com.

[01:20:53.978 --> 01:20:54.598]  Effective.
[01:20:55.158 --> 01:20:59.621]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:01.223]  Those times may be near.
[01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:02.123]  Think about it.
[01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:06.747]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:21:06.747 --> 01:21:11.370]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:21:11.730 --> 01:21:17.535]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:21:17.535 --> 01:21:24.240]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:26.782]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:21:27.242 --> 01:21:30.044]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[01:21:54.997 --> 01:21:56.958]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:21:56.958 --> 01:22:02.280]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.860]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:12.204]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:22:19.888 --> 01:22:22.071]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:22:22.071 --> 01:22:26.577]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.

[01:22:54.327 --> 01:22:56.388]  North Korea openly threatens the U.S.
[01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:58.270]  and launches a new missile every other week.
[01:22:58.270 --> 01:22:59.530]  Their warhead of choice?
[01:22:59.530 --> 01:23:00.971]  Electromagnetic pulse.
[01:23:00.971 --> 01:23:02.452]  Such an event would cripple the U.S.
[01:23:02.452 --> 01:23:04.914]  power grid for years and leave millions in the dark.

[01:24:11.696 --> 01:24:13.298]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:24:13.298 --> 01:24:18.586]  I want to invite Robert Spencer of jihadwatch.org on for a full hour.
[01:24:19.997 --> 01:24:24.620]  Really once a month, and I want to invite him to go on The War Room and some of our other broadcasts, because here's the thing.
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:33.065]  InfoWars is one of the only groups that has the mass of listeners to punch through this, if our listeners take action.
[01:24:33.065 --> 01:24:43.571]  Drudge also, and he's been attacked and criticized, and they've tried to say that the Federal Elections Commission should investigate him criminally and me, and we're paid for by the Russians, and all this other crud.
[01:24:43.571 --> 01:24:45.352]  You heard our guests, it's true.
[01:24:45.352 --> 01:24:49.175]  We have more censorship by Google, Facebook, and Twitter now than in the Soviet Union.
[01:24:49.835 --> 01:24:52.458]  They admit they're doing it.
[01:24:52.458 --> 01:24:52.958]  Okay?
[01:24:52.958 --> 01:24:56.381]  So the listeners have to know we're in a war.
[01:24:56.381 --> 01:24:58.704]  And if they're able to curtail this, they're going to shut everybody down.
[01:24:58.704 --> 01:24:59.985]  They're going for broke.
[01:24:59.985 --> 01:25:02.988]  This is real authoritarianism in their own words.
[01:25:02.988 --> 01:25:04.349]  Hillary's admitted this.
[01:25:04.349 --> 01:25:06.331]  She meant to be in power and doing this now.
[01:25:06.331 --> 01:25:10.835]  So they're going ahead with the plan they had in place that Obama and Hillary put in place.
[01:25:10.835 --> 01:25:11.236]  So listen.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.521]  You've got to spread the links to Jihad Watch.
[01:25:14.521 --> 01:25:15.661]  You've got to support them.
[01:25:15.661 --> 01:25:17.741]  You've got to support Infowars.com.
[01:25:17.741 --> 01:25:19.182]  And I'm not griping at you.
[01:25:19.182 --> 01:25:20.742]  This is a great historic moment.
[01:25:20.742 --> 01:25:26.524]  You've got to hand-share in your own personal email to friends and family, hey, here's the censored sites.
[01:25:26.524 --> 01:25:29.185]  Because historically, there's a Streisand effect.
[01:25:29.185 --> 01:25:34.606]  They're miscalculating and thinking they can just quietly censor us and we'll go away.
[01:25:34.606 --> 01:25:35.906]  They're trying to break your will.
[01:25:35.906 --> 01:25:37.707]  We have to realize this is serious.
[01:25:38.527 --> 01:25:42.310]  And have a maximum effort to stand up against this.
[01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:47.374]  What else do you think, Robert Spencer of jihadwatch.org, we should do?
[01:25:47.374 --> 01:25:55.219]  Oh, well, you know, we need to raise awareness about this whole idea about hate speech that I hear so many times when I speak on college campuses.
[01:25:55.219 --> 01:26:00.403]  If I'm not just screamed at and shouted down altogether, then I hear, I see it again and again now, Alex.
[01:26:00.902 --> 01:26:01.583]  We're good to go.
[01:26:18.115 --> 01:26:28.360]  He was a journalist exposing that mainline Islam was allied with Hitler and is still allied with that and then he was going to go to jail for as being a journalist!
[01:26:48.376 --> 01:26:51.238]  Yeah, and yet it's demonstrable fact.
[01:26:51.238 --> 01:27:09.552]  Haj Amin al-Husseini, the Mufti of Jerusalem, the leading authority in the Islamic world, spent 1941-45 in Berlin, made broadcasts for the Nazis in Arabic, encouraging Muslims, quoting the Quran about how evil the Jews were, encouraging them to support Hitler.
[01:27:09.552 --> 01:27:13.575]  This is just a matter of fact, but fact and truth, that's what's being outlawed.
[01:27:14.055 --> 01:27:16.417]  And, you know, Hillary Clinton did start this.
[01:27:16.417 --> 01:27:27.543]  Four or five years ago, remember, when she was Secretary of State, she signed on to Resolution 1618 at the United Nations, which called on member states to criminalize incitement to religious hatred.
[01:27:27.543 --> 01:27:31.526]  Now, nobody cares when people criticize Islam, I mean, criticize Christianity.
[01:27:31.526 --> 01:27:34.367]  You know, the crucifix and the jar of urine, that's art.
[01:27:34.367 --> 01:27:36.328]  That's not the religious hatred they're talking about.
[01:27:36.328 --> 01:27:38.790]  They were talking about criticism of Islam.
[01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:42.232]  And less well known is that Hillary Clinton went to Istanbul
[01:27:42.722 --> 01:28:00.270]  In December 2012, and spoke in a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and she said, well yes, we have this First Amendment, we can't just outlaw various kinds of speech outright, but we can use old-fashioned techniques of peer pressure and shaming to get people not to say what we don't want them to say.
[01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:04.992]  That's Cass Sunstein, that's the nudging, and then you see this venomous
[01:28:05.812 --> 01:28:13.060]  Yeah, and the peer pressure and shaming works just the way that they planned it.
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:14.701]  The SPLC's hate group list
[01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:33.596]  It's trying to shame us into not saying these things that are critical of Islam by lumping us in together with real hate groups, you know, the Klan and the Neo-Nazis and all that.
[01:28:33.596 --> 01:28:35.537]  And people, it works!
[01:28:35.537 --> 01:28:50.784]  Remember, in San Bernardino, when 15 people were killed by Islamic terrorists at a Christmas party in 2015, they interviewed the neighbors, and the neighbors said, yeah, we saw a lot of suspicious things going on in that house, but we didn't call the police, we didn't want to seem racist.
[01:28:51.204 --> 01:28:54.425]  They were susceptible to that shaming that Hillary Clinton was talking about.
[01:28:54.425 --> 01:28:58.767]  And it's a new religion to submit to it and to say we're going to be Islamic.
[01:28:58.767 --> 01:29:01.288]  European leaders now go, yeah, we are going to be Islamic.
[01:29:01.288 --> 01:29:06.310]  It's so insane, like this police chief saying, we need terrorists in our schools.
[01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:07.291]  He actually said that.
[01:29:08.086 --> 01:29:09.106]  Incredible.
[01:29:09.106 --> 01:29:13.048]  Yeah, but I see incredible stories like this every day at Jihad Watch.
[01:29:13.048 --> 01:29:16.189]  From out of Sweden, out of Germany.
[01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:19.011]  It's racist, it's bigoted, it's Islamophobic.
[01:29:19.011 --> 01:29:26.794]  If you raise the slightest dissenting word about this crime wave, this rape wave, everything that's come from these Muslim migrants.
[01:29:27.014 --> 01:29:27.414]  That's right.
[01:29:27.414 --> 01:29:29.516]  Well, please come back soon to break it all down.
[01:29:29.516 --> 01:29:32.559]  I'm very impressed with the work of Jihad Watch over the decade-plus I've been reading.
[01:29:32.559 --> 01:29:34.220]  You just show what they're saying.
[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:36.842]  That's why they hate you so much, just like we do.
[01:29:36.842 --> 01:29:39.384]  We've got to stand together and develop a plan to fight back.
[01:29:39.384 --> 01:29:40.505]  We will win, sir.
[01:29:40.505 --> 01:29:41.266]  God bless you.
[01:29:41.266 --> 01:29:41.806]  We'll be back.
[01:29:41.806 --> 01:29:44.908]  Stay with us.
[01:29:44.908 --> 01:29:46.290]  We're on the march.
[01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:48.832]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.832 --> 01:29:51.514]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.499 --> 01:30:03.481]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[01:30:03.481 --> 01:30:08.982]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[01:30:08.982 --> 01:30:12.323]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[01:30:12.323 --> 01:30:14.684]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[01:30:14.684 --> 01:30:20.025]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities, to the individual?
[01:30:20.025 --> 01:30:21.865]  That is the ultimate concern.
[01:30:21.865 --> 01:30:24.126]  The concentration of power, the excess of power,
[01:30:24.266 --> 01:30:28.029]  ...was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[01:30:28.029 --> 01:30:30.531]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[01:30:30.531 --> 01:30:34.814]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[01:30:34.814 --> 01:30:39.577]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[01:30:39.577 --> 01:30:44.521]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[01:30:44.921 --> 01:30:50.306]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[01:30:50.306 --> 01:30:54.029]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[01:30:54.029 --> 01:30:55.871]  BramfordWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:30:56.624 --> 01:31:04.912]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[01:31:04.912 --> 01:31:06.133]  A 360 win.
[01:31:06.133 --> 01:31:12.699]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[01:31:12.699 --> 01:31:20.226]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:31:20.626 --> 01:31:25.688]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:31:25.688 --> 01:31:31.790]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:39.593]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:31:39.593 --> 01:31:46.095]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature in InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:31:46.095 --> 01:31:47.596]  10% off on AutoShip.
[01:31:52.180 --> 01:32:01.369]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:32:01.369 --> 01:32:11.999]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had
[01:32:12.199 --> 01:32:17.941]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists, we're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the
[01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:42.230]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:32:42.230 --> 01:32:44.132]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:12.225 --> 01:33:19.687]  So imagine your Jihad watch around for, I don't know, 15 years.
[01:33:19.687 --> 01:33:25.169]  You just show what radical Islamic leaders are saying, what the groups are doing.
[01:33:25.169 --> 01:33:28.170]  You expose ISIS and Al-Qaeda planning massive attacks.
[01:33:28.170 --> 01:33:32.891]  You show Hillary and Obama and others openly promoting it and funding them.
[01:33:32.891 --> 01:33:39.113]  And PayPal says, you're banned because the Southern Poverty Law Center, an offshore cartel,
[01:33:40.754 --> 01:33:43.215]  Hundreds of millions offshore, not just the 60 million they found.
[01:33:43.215 --> 01:33:46.656]  Funded by George Soros, an actual Nazi.
[01:33:46.656 --> 01:33:50.657]  You are banned from commerce.
[01:33:50.657 --> 01:33:52.037]  And it's happening to everybody.
[01:33:52.037 --> 01:33:54.337]  And a lot of folks say, well, we better shut up.
[01:33:54.337 --> 01:33:55.918]  We better go along.
[01:33:55.918 --> 01:33:58.759]  We better not link too much to Alex Jones.
[01:33:58.759 --> 01:34:00.919]  Or maybe they'll come after us.
[01:34:00.919 --> 01:34:07.541]  If you bow to that intimidation, if you go along with that, you will be destroyed.
[01:34:07.541 --> 01:34:08.321]  Make no mistake.
[01:34:09.554 --> 01:34:15.642]  Just a few months ago, they had the Federal Elections Commission wanting me criminally investigated, along with Matt Drudge.
[01:34:15.642 --> 01:34:23.232]  And of course, the Republican Congress shot it down, claiming we must be funded by Russia, and that they wanted to know our finances.
[01:34:23.232 --> 01:34:24.794]  Know our finances?
[01:34:24.794 --> 01:34:26.136]  Zero money from Russia!
[01:34:27.137 --> 01:34:31.941]  100% from the listeners of this broadcast.
[01:34:31.941 --> 01:34:42.089]  Either supporting some of the sponsors we have on the site that you can see, or, ladies and gentlemen, buying products directly from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:34:42.089 --> 01:34:43.530]  And the answer is lawsuits.
[01:34:43.530 --> 01:34:44.611]  They don't have total immunity.
[01:34:44.611 --> 01:34:45.612]  That's a trick they're saying.
[01:34:45.612 --> 01:34:47.414]  When they violate civil rights, that trumps it.
[01:34:49.087 --> 01:35:00.759]  They're engaged in so many other activities, and I wanted to talk to Chuck Johnson, whose site's also been banned from Trump seeing it, because Melania Trump, the wife, I mean, you can't just let the president talk to his wife!
[01:35:00.759 --> 01:35:03.281]  We gotta have command and control!
[01:35:03.281 --> 01:35:07.385]  Chuck Johnson blasts John Kelly for blacklisting InfoWars and GotNews.
[01:35:07.385 --> 01:35:07.986]  That's his site.
[01:35:07.986 --> 01:35:09.828]  Vows to survive a failed general.
[01:35:11.001 --> 01:35:18.527]  Well, look, I don't want to sit here and attack Kelly and go through all this, but now they've gotten Keith Schiller, the 30-year bodyguard, best friends with Trump.
[01:35:18.527 --> 01:35:19.768]  The guys are best friends.
[01:35:19.768 --> 01:35:20.809]  Totally trust him.
[01:35:20.809 --> 01:35:24.551]  The guy works 18 hours a day when Trump wants to work 18 hours a day.
[01:35:24.551 --> 01:35:26.313]  Couldn't get in to see him for a week.
[01:35:26.313 --> 01:35:28.414]  They did something to his family.
[01:35:28.414 --> 01:35:29.715]  He resigned.
[01:35:29.715 --> 01:35:31.237]  Couldn't even get to the President.
[01:35:31.237 --> 01:35:32.638]  We heard the President's crushed.
[01:35:34.375 --> 01:35:37.119]  Okay, so we've got all this information.
[01:35:37.119 --> 01:35:49.618]  Meanwhile, Dominican woman testifies Menendez helped her with her visa and his whole child molestation investigation going on a trial into corruption and our guest has been down there.
[01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:52.441]  Chuck Johnson covering it all.
[01:35:52.441 --> 01:35:54.262]  He'll give us the details here in a moment.
[01:35:54.262 --> 01:35:59.285]  But bottom line, it is an act of total rebellion against tyranny.
[01:35:59.285 --> 01:36:09.111]  Because they're not just going to stop censoring us or, you know, blocking D. James Kennedy or Focus on the Family from selling books on Amazon or banning them from PayPal.
[01:36:09.111 --> 01:36:11.433]  I mean, this is all happening.
[01:36:11.433 --> 01:36:18.177]  Yeah, D. James Kennedy, mainline, milquetoast, good Christian pastor, my late grandmother's favorite pastor.
[01:36:19.002 --> 01:36:27.050]  Just go over to her house with her, into the nursing home with her, and she'd like to watch her D. James Kennedy, listed as a demon.
[01:36:27.050 --> 01:36:28.911]  Again, you're like, oh, just ban the Nazis.
[01:36:28.911 --> 01:36:31.153]  I told you it'd be everybody next.
[01:36:31.153 --> 01:36:32.815]  Now you criticize Islam in any way.
[01:36:32.815 --> 01:36:34.236]  Boom, you're arrested in Europe.
[01:36:34.236 --> 01:36:36.719]  It's gonna be the exact same system, and it's here!
[01:36:37.782 --> 01:36:45.572]  So SpreadInfoWars.com, SpreadNewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, get the videos out, the articles, hand-spread them to everybody you know.
[01:36:45.572 --> 01:36:48.796]  Everything we're doing, they're fighting for you not seeing.
[01:36:48.796 --> 01:36:50.378]  Listen, I don't have the crew.
[01:36:50.378 --> 01:36:51.139]  We're trying to expand.
[01:36:52.366 --> 01:36:59.011]  I've got four people to try to cut up the live show videos now of 10 hours live a day, put it up on Facebook, Twitter.
[01:36:59.011 --> 01:37:03.514]  Most of the viral stuff is on your Twitter account, your Google account, your YouTube account.
[01:37:03.514 --> 01:37:16.483]  Even if it's not big, if you take something we cover that's interesting, edit it down to five, 10 minutes, or grab one of our already posted videos, copy it to your channel, they're copyright free.
[01:37:16.483 --> 01:37:18.525]  That's where I see 10 million, 20 million, 40 million, 50 million, 60 million.
[01:37:21.610 --> 01:37:29.775]  Just earlier this year, we had more than 15 videos with more than 35 million views apiece on one Facebook.
[01:37:29.775 --> 01:37:33.838]  They deleted every one of them, just like that, because they just kept rolling.
[01:37:33.838 --> 01:37:36.600]  Once they had 35, 40 million, it was just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.182]  It was going to be 200 million, 300 million, game over, we win, we win, we win.
[01:37:40.182 --> 01:37:46.206]  They're trying to shut down PewDiePie with his 18 million views because he's starting to wake up.
[01:37:46.206 --> 01:37:47.327]  First, they demonetize him.
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.862]  Say, you better do what we want.
[01:37:49.862 --> 01:37:50.944]  He wasn't even political.
[01:37:50.944 --> 01:37:53.087]  They just were jealous.
[01:37:53.087 --> 01:37:54.228]  See, that's the thing.
[01:37:54.228 --> 01:37:57.573]  They want total control, people.
[01:37:57.573 --> 01:37:59.075]  So, it's all coming down.
[01:37:59.075 --> 01:38:01.078]  Please financially support the broadcast.
[01:38:01.078 --> 01:38:02.399]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:38:02.399 --> 01:38:03.962]  You see we're in a major expansion.
[01:38:03.962 --> 01:38:04.703]  Hiring more people.
[01:38:06.271 --> 01:38:11.074]  But we gotta sell a lot of fluoride-free toothpaste to fund this, and it's 50% off right now.
[01:38:11.074 --> 01:38:16.178]  All the Super Blue, fluoride-free, colloidal silver, and iodine.
[01:38:16.178 --> 01:38:18.119]  Children's and adults, it's all there.
[01:38:18.119 --> 01:38:21.241]  Z-Shield Heavy Metal Detoxifier, that's 40% off.
[01:38:21.241 --> 01:38:23.543]  Cape Man is still 50% off.
[01:38:23.543 --> 01:38:26.464]  Super Paleo Formula, that is gonna end very, very soon.
[01:38:26.464 --> 01:38:30.427]  Just commit to go to infowarestore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:38:30.427 --> 01:38:32.328]  You know we're public enemy number one.
[01:38:36.451 --> 01:38:44.999]  When they've got two shows on Comedy Central saying they're supposedly Alex Jones and then saying a bunch of things I never said.
[01:38:44.999 --> 01:38:49.584]  Saying racist things, saying hateful things, saying I hate people with long hair.
[01:38:49.584 --> 01:38:52.026]  So guys walk up with long hair and get mad at me on the street now.
[01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:53.728]  That's how... See, here's what's happened.
[01:38:54.966 --> 01:38:59.067]  They lost the news audience of folks that were at least trying to get real news.
[01:38:59.067 --> 01:39:01.748]  They lost the 20% that actually are into news.
[01:39:01.748 --> 01:39:05.450]  They've been brainwashing everybody just in entertainment to go along with globalism.
[01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:14.413]  Now they've weaponized that in popular culture in movies and TV shows on HBO and Comedy Central and Showtime.
[01:39:14.413 --> 01:39:15.413]  And who's the main enemy?
[01:39:15.413 --> 01:39:17.294]  Trump and then me.
[01:39:17.294 --> 01:39:22.456]  Then they edit or misrepresent what we say to activate and weaponize the average zombie
[01:39:24.039 --> 01:39:26.561]  Who doesn't know Suspended Disbelief?
[01:39:26.561 --> 01:39:31.224]  And if Stephen Colbert says I'm a Nazi, even though he's the one hollering Hitler, they're gonna come!
[01:39:33.373 --> 01:39:35.755]  Now, a lot of folks say, well, we better back down.
[01:39:35.755 --> 01:39:39.339]  There's no, go hide in a hole and wait.
[01:39:39.339 --> 01:39:40.860]  They want to sexualize your kids.
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:42.662]  They want to conquer the whole enchilada.
[01:39:42.662 --> 01:39:43.863]  They're coming, folks.
[01:39:43.863 --> 01:39:45.504]  They're anti-human globalists.
[01:39:45.504 --> 01:39:47.466]  They're allied with orthodox Islam.
[01:39:47.466 --> 01:39:48.587]  This isn't a game.
[01:39:48.587 --> 01:39:50.729]  They're destroying basic free speech.
[01:39:50.729 --> 01:39:52.911]  They're a bigger threat than the real Nazis were.
[01:39:52.911 --> 01:39:54.273]  They use those real tactics.
[01:39:56.553 --> 01:39:57.934]  So, commit.
[01:39:57.934 --> 01:39:58.474]  Pray for us.
[01:39:58.474 --> 01:39:59.054]  We're praying for you.
[01:39:59.054 --> 01:39:59.934]  We're in this together.
[01:39:59.934 --> 01:40:00.935]  We've got a beachhead.
[01:40:00.935 --> 01:40:02.435]  We've got the Freedom Caucus.
[01:40:02.435 --> 01:40:04.396]  We're taking over the Republican Party.
[01:40:04.396 --> 01:40:06.877]  Trump's done a lot of great stuff, but he's surrounded.
[01:40:06.877 --> 01:40:12.920]  The enemy's not that strong if you understand how evil they are and just decide to not be intimidated by them.
[01:40:14.025 --> 01:40:19.388]  But they now know they're losing, so they can get the upper hand again, they're going to shut everything down.
[01:40:19.388 --> 01:40:28.553]  We're going into hardcore authoritarianism if we don't really gut up and commit and stop living on our knees of these bullies.
[01:40:28.553 --> 01:40:30.394]  So, thank you all for your support, your prayers.
[01:40:30.394 --> 01:40:33.035]  I want to thank all of our affiliates as well.
[01:40:33.035 --> 01:40:36.217]  It burns them up that we're reaching millions of people a day.
[01:40:36.217 --> 01:40:39.899]  And despite all their attempts at censorship and blocking us, it isn't working.
[01:40:40.953 --> 01:40:44.335]  Despite all the intimidation they've done behind the scenes.
[01:40:44.335 --> 01:40:46.977]  Blocking us on Facebook, Twitter, you know, all over.
[01:40:46.977 --> 01:40:48.298]  Drugs use a link to us all the time.
[01:40:48.298 --> 01:40:50.359]  You know, they threaten criminal investigations on him.
[01:40:50.359 --> 01:40:50.999]  You say he's not.
[01:40:50.999 --> 01:40:51.640]  It's fine.
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:52.881]  I understand.
[01:40:52.881 --> 01:40:53.901]  But we're in the kitchen.
[01:40:53.901 --> 01:40:56.763]  We're going 110% in this fire.
[01:40:56.763 --> 01:40:59.045]  And we're going to go through the other side together.
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:03.281]  Because that's what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:03.281 --> 01:41:09.662]  So I am again asking all of you to recommit to launch your own websites, do your own videos.
[01:41:09.662 --> 01:41:12.343]  The answer is all of you starting to demonstrate, speaking out.
[01:41:12.343 --> 01:41:13.624]  They want to intimidate you.
[01:41:13.624 --> 01:41:14.824]  They want to bully you.
[01:41:14.824 --> 01:41:18.845]  They want to say you're a Nazi if you support free speech or against abortion.
[01:41:18.845 --> 01:41:19.825]  They want to do all this.
[01:41:19.825 --> 01:41:26.767]  It's not working and the world's waking up and that's why they're so desperate and are trying to censor and it's blowing up in their face.
[01:41:28.092 --> 01:41:34.598]  Imagine, the president, they say on the news, don't worry, the president's not allowed to read Info Wars now.
[01:41:34.598 --> 01:41:38.602]  What, so you see police chiefs saying, we want terrorists in school with our kids?
[01:41:38.602 --> 01:41:43.206]  They actually say, we want terrorists who've killed people in school with our children.
[01:41:43.206 --> 01:41:44.127]  Why do they say that?
[01:41:44.127 --> 01:41:45.228]  That sounds crazy.
[01:41:45.228 --> 01:41:47.350]  To break your will!
[01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:49.092]  That's to demoralize you!
[01:41:49.092 --> 01:41:52.956]  If they can talk like that and have the major police chief, right here in the article,
[01:41:53.816 --> 01:41:54.417]  Say that!
[01:41:54.417 --> 01:41:56.398]  They can do anything!
[01:41:56.398 --> 01:42:00.201]  They'll induct you into Stockholm Syndrome!
[01:42:00.201 --> 01:42:02.823]  So, joining us is Chuck Johnson.
[01:42:02.823 --> 01:42:05.045]  Appreciate him coming on.
[01:42:05.045 --> 01:42:18.755]  We're going to give you his website and also put that up on screen, but here we are in the same crew here, InfoWars and GotNews.com, being the example of what they want to ban.
[01:42:18.755 --> 01:42:19.896]  And if they're able to do that,
[01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:27.855]  If they're able to beta test that, they're coming for everybody, then they're coming for your bank accounts, your kids, they want to run your life.
[01:42:27.855 --> 01:42:29.816]  Chuck Johnson, thanks for joining us.
[01:42:29.816 --> 01:42:31.877]  Thank you for having me, Alex.
[01:42:31.877 --> 01:42:35.740]  Well, do you want to get into the censorship first or the Senator Menendez trial?
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:39.763]  Let's get into the censorship first because it's so worth getting fired up over.
[01:42:39.763 --> 01:42:48.429]  I mean, we're in a real fight now where private corporations are working with the governments and with outside activist groups like the SPLC.
[01:42:49.212 --> 01:42:51.893]  To target people and destroy their livelihoods.
[01:42:51.893 --> 01:42:54.094]  It's do or die for a lot of people.
[01:42:54.094 --> 01:42:57.976]  And I've got to tell you, a lot of folks need to start looking into Bitcoin.
[01:42:57.976 --> 01:43:04.499]  I know, you know, you might be a skeptic on this, Alex, but, you know, Bitcoin has changed God News' finances for the better.
[01:43:04.499 --> 01:43:08.100]  It certainly helped Julian Assange avoid paying off... No, no, I'm not against it.
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:12.962]  I just don't get anything speculative because I know they claim me breathing is illegal.
[01:43:12.962 --> 01:43:16.384]  So, you know... I hear you.
[01:43:17.355 --> 01:43:18.356]  Yeah, you've got to be careful.
[01:43:18.356 --> 01:43:19.618]  You've got to be careful with it.
[01:43:19.618 --> 01:43:24.824]  Obviously, it's, you know, it's unproven technology, but it's done well over the last six years or so.
[01:43:24.824 --> 01:43:31.832]  But in any event, the reason I, you know, I think we're going to have to crowdfund at some point to do lawsuits against these companies.
[01:43:31.832 --> 01:43:36.478]  We're going to have to have whistleblowers on the inside of them talking about the unethical behavior going on.
[01:43:36.478 --> 01:43:37.559]  And that's already starting.
[01:43:38.837 --> 01:43:39.638]  That's already starting.
[01:43:39.638 --> 01:43:44.704]  You know, there are people who are even, you know, good leftists and others who are just waking up in these companies.
[01:43:44.704 --> 01:43:52.293]  They know that first they shut down the Nazis, but then of course they're coming for... Breitbart is having its ads targeted.
[01:43:52.293 --> 01:43:57.279]  There have been all these sites now where people's livelihoods are getting crushed.
[01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:01.262]  You know, Gateway Pundit has had this happen too.
[01:44:01.262 --> 01:44:05.446]  And we're reaching a point now where they're trying to use advertiser boycotts.
[01:44:05.446 --> 01:44:08.368]  They're trying to ban us from technologies.
[01:44:08.368 --> 01:44:11.590]  This is all, you know, and a lot of these companies are created in California.
[01:44:11.590 --> 01:44:14.833]  It's illegal to discriminate against people on their politics in California.
[01:44:15.333 --> 01:44:15.713]  That's right.
[01:44:15.713 --> 01:44:16.193]  Let's be clear.
[01:44:16.193 --> 01:44:21.514]  They're trying to not let us have access to new software, new platforms, new systems.
[01:44:21.514 --> 01:44:25.635]  It's a trillion times worse than not letting, you know, people bake a gay couple of cake.
[01:44:25.635 --> 01:44:27.035]  And I'm not for that either.
[01:44:27.035 --> 01:44:29.975]  But this is such discrimination.
[01:44:29.975 --> 01:44:31.576]  Yeah, and it's pretty wild.
[01:44:31.576 --> 01:44:33.616]  At some point, we're going to have to use the FTC.
[01:44:33.616 --> 01:44:39.197]  I mean, I talked to some people at the Departments of Justice and the Antitrust Division going after Google.
[01:44:39.197 --> 01:44:44.558]  Like, we're going to have to start using, unfortunately, we're going to have to start using our allies in the government to fight them.
[01:44:45.388 --> 01:44:48.131]  Um, and it's very, uh, it's very disturbing what's been going on.
[01:45:02.128 --> 01:45:03.029]  There it is on screen.
[01:45:03.029 --> 01:45:05.652]  Working to kill people for their free speech.
[01:45:05.652 --> 01:45:06.933]  They will kill you.
[01:45:06.933 --> 01:45:12.220]  Facebook and Twitter will sit there and help you be murdered by authoritarian regimes.
[01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:13.561]  They are ready and willing.
[01:45:13.561 --> 01:45:16.845]  They've hired the old Stasi in Germany to help run Facebook.
[01:45:16.845 --> 01:45:19.408]  You cannot make this up.
[01:45:19.408 --> 01:45:21.891]  No, it's very scary stuff and it's going to be accelerating.
[01:45:22.455 --> 01:45:29.600]  You know, because we have a whole generation now of young people who don't really believe in the values of free speech and the culture of free speech.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.722]  And we have all these people who are very legalistic.
[01:45:31.722 --> 01:45:42.430]  You know, they seem to believe that private corporations can't fire and hire who they want, but somehow the private corporation has a right to decide that they won't do business with whoever they want for whatever reason they want.
[01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:45.472]  And of course, we have public accommodation laws for a reason.
[01:45:45.472 --> 01:45:49.475]  And I think it's much scarier, though, because so many of these tech companies are monopolies.
[01:45:50.115 --> 01:45:52.516]  What would happen if they just turned off the Skype right now?
[01:45:52.516 --> 01:45:55.197]  You know, what would happen if they just banned you from the Internet?
[01:45:55.197 --> 01:46:02.480]  And, you know, I was I was conveying against this and fighting against this two years ago when I was the first journalist banned on Twitter.
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:12.383]  And I got banned for insulting Jack Dorsey's friend, and people said it's his boyfriend, Jeremy McKesson, who's the founder of Black Lives Matter.
[01:46:12.383 --> 01:46:13.124]  And I was banned.
[01:46:13.124 --> 01:46:15.565]  You know, people said, oh, you know, you're just extreme.
[01:46:15.565 --> 01:46:16.845]  You know, don't worry.
[01:46:16.845 --> 01:46:19.106]  You know, you're an extremist and all this sort of thing.
[01:46:19.542 --> 01:46:20.363]  It won't happen to me.
[01:46:20.363 --> 01:46:22.325]  That's what Milo Yiannopoulos said to me.
[01:46:22.325 --> 01:46:24.466]  And then, of course, he was banned.
[01:46:24.466 --> 01:46:26.028]  And so this is how it works now.
[01:46:26.028 --> 01:46:28.270]  There's a second-class citizenship.
[01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:41.982]  And until we fight back, until we start targeting these companies with protests, with letter-writing campaigns, emails, with trolling, with showing up and really disrupting their shareholder meetings, these things will continue.
[01:46:41.982 --> 01:46:42.863]  And they need to be stopped.
[01:46:44.591 --> 01:46:53.939]  Well, people like Heiko Maas, the German Justice Minister, arresting journalists that even report that Islam worked with Hitler, this guy needs to be in jail.
[01:46:53.939 --> 01:46:55.120]  He's the tyrant.
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:56.161]  He's the thug.
[01:46:56.161 --> 01:46:56.902]  He's the problem.
[01:46:58.629 --> 01:47:08.173]  Well, you know, there's this attitude that they all have now, that the social justice warriors and technologists have, which is that if they ban something, it will just go away.
[01:47:08.173 --> 01:47:10.154]  But in my view, it actually becomes much stronger.
[01:47:10.154 --> 01:47:12.075]  It becomes much more vitriolic.
[01:47:12.075 --> 01:47:13.716]  It goes much deeper underground.
[01:47:13.716 --> 01:47:15.396]  Historically, it always does.
[01:47:15.396 --> 01:47:16.537]  Don't they understand?
[01:47:18.365 --> 01:47:21.208]  No, one of the ways to deal with this stuff is to bring it out in the open and discuss it.
[01:47:21.208 --> 01:47:25.551]  But of course, that would take away the thing that they're addicted to, which is their power.
[01:47:25.551 --> 01:47:31.016]  And that's the thing that, you know, we're dealing with a bunch of zombies who are addicted to power and who will do anything to preserve it.
[01:47:31.016 --> 01:47:43.827]  You know, even if it means jailing their fellow countrymen over Facebook posts or over... I mean, I myself was banned for Facebook for replying to somebody calling me a homophobic slur.
[01:47:43.827 --> 01:47:45.409]  And I just quoted him and I got banned.
[01:47:46.491 --> 01:47:54.322]  So, I mean, it gives you a sense of where we are now, where people can use the report function on all these posts to basically tattle on people.
[01:47:54.322 --> 01:47:58.408]  I wonder what would happen if, on the report function, you could actually adjudicate it.
[01:47:58.408 --> 01:47:59.750]  You could actually have a court system.
[01:47:59.750 --> 01:48:01.533]  You could actually defend yourself.
[01:48:01.613 --> 01:48:08.598]  Of course it's also turned out that they have super bot people that are the equivalent of a hundred or a thousand votes.
[01:48:08.598 --> 01:48:10.420]  So that's even rigged too.
[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:17.225]  It's their own employees going around with the controls and then all they're doing is acting like the community reported it so it's okay.
[01:48:18.223 --> 01:48:22.665]  Yeah, I mean, look, there's a lot of stuff that I know that's going to come out about Facebook in the very near future.
[01:48:22.665 --> 01:48:24.765]  Whistleblowers in there.
[01:48:24.765 --> 01:48:27.606]  Much like we saw with the Google James Damore guy.
[01:48:27.606 --> 01:48:29.187]  By the way, it's somebody you should have on your show.
[01:48:29.187 --> 01:48:29.827]  I want him on.
[01:48:29.827 --> 01:48:32.828]  If you know how to get him on, I want James Damore on bad.
[01:48:32.828 --> 01:48:33.349]  Yeah, we'll do it.
[01:48:33.349 --> 01:48:33.809]  We'll do it.
[01:48:33.809 --> 01:48:35.009]  I'll put you in touch with him.
[01:48:35.009 --> 01:48:36.250]  But let me just add this.
[01:48:36.250 --> 01:48:38.711]  I think what you're saying, lawsuits are key as well.
[01:48:38.711 --> 01:48:40.011]  Civil rights, racketeering.
[01:48:40.011 --> 01:48:41.151]  They can't have immunity from that.
[01:48:41.151 --> 01:48:42.132]  I don't care what Obama said.
[01:48:42.132 --> 01:48:43.252]  We're going to get them.
[01:48:43.252 --> 01:48:44.513]  But expanding on that.
[01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:46.471]  This is incredible.
[01:48:46.471 --> 01:48:47.911]  The answer is whistleblowers.
[01:48:47.911 --> 01:48:51.834]  People in these systems need to leak all this now.
[01:48:51.834 --> 01:48:52.894]  I mean, liberals.
[01:48:52.894 --> 01:49:05.642]  They're merging with radical Islam that literally enslaves women, murders gays, and I'm not saying that to patronize, but you ought to be ashamed of yourselves as so-called liberals who claim you really care about people's rights.
[01:49:05.642 --> 01:49:06.482]  No, you don't.
[01:49:06.482 --> 01:49:13.006]  You use it as a way to have power over the rest of society, and you're allied with a murdering group of crazy people.
[01:49:13.246 --> 01:49:14.507]  And you're disgusting!
[01:49:14.507 --> 01:49:19.929]  If you don't stand up and speak out, so-called liberals, you are part of it!
[01:49:19.929 --> 01:49:29.713]  I agree 100% and it's interesting to watch the psychology of these people because, you know, they're really masochistic and they hate their own people in a very serious way.
[01:49:29.713 --> 01:49:30.713]  They hate their countries.
[01:49:30.713 --> 01:49:38.016]  I mean, this idea that we need to start destroying statues, we need to start tearing down our culture and destroying our civilization.
[01:49:39.897 --> 01:49:42.538]  These are not people who build things up.
[01:49:42.538 --> 01:49:51.922]  They use their power to destroy other ideas, to destroy books, to ban books from Amazon, or to restrict people from SoundCloud.
[01:49:51.922 --> 01:49:55.804]  This is what these people do, and it's very, very frightening.
[01:49:55.804 --> 01:49:57.285]  We need to figure out a way to fight it.
[01:49:57.905 --> 01:50:03.650]  It is legal, but also consistent with our values, and not just surrender to it, as so many people want to do.
[01:50:03.650 --> 01:50:09.655]  And the attitude that a lot of folks have in the conservative movement is, oh, don't worry, they'll eat me last, right?
[01:50:09.655 --> 01:50:15.500]  But, you know, the demand for Internet Nazis vastly exceeds their supply on the left.
[01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:18.362]  They will make everyone into a Nazi before they're finished.
[01:50:18.362 --> 01:50:22.225]  Just like the SPLC makes Ben Carson into a white supremacist, right?
[01:50:22.225 --> 01:50:24.507]  I mean, this is how absurd these things have become.
[01:50:26.314 --> 01:50:27.555]  Wow.
[01:50:27.555 --> 01:50:30.316]  I'm going to come back and let's get into this trial of the Senator.
[01:50:30.316 --> 01:50:36.439]  I mean, it's just constantly, these people continue to get busted doing these horrible things you've been there covering.
[01:50:36.439 --> 01:50:37.140]  Another U.S.
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:38.981]  Senator falls from grace.
[01:50:38.981 --> 01:50:44.203]  We'll get into why they're having the trial, what's coming out in the trial with Chuck Johnson, and more straight ahead.
[01:50:44.203 --> 01:50:49.546]  And then, we've got Professor James McCanney coming on about weather modification.
[01:50:49.546 --> 01:50:52.748]  Laura Loomer has got some big breaking news.
[01:50:52.748 --> 01:50:54.569]  Paul Joseph Watson, stay with us.
[01:50:55.652 --> 01:51:00.115]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:51:00.115 --> 01:51:01.716]  Those times may be near.
[01:51:01.716 --> 01:51:02.616]  Think about it.
[01:51:02.616 --> 01:51:07.219]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:51:07.219 --> 01:51:11.862]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:51:12.202 --> 01:51:18.027]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:51:18.027 --> 01:51:24.732]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:51:24.732 --> 01:51:27.274]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:51:27.714 --> 01:51:30.515]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[01:51:55.386 --> 01:51:57.448]  North Korea openly threatens the U.S.
[01:51:57.448 --> 01:51:59.349]  and launches a new missile every other week.
[01:51:59.349 --> 01:52:00.590]  Their warhead of choice?
[01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:02.011]  Electromagnetic pulse.
[01:52:02.011 --> 01:52:03.512]  Such an event would cripple the U.S.
[01:52:03.512 --> 01:52:05.973]  power grid for years and leave millions in the dark.

[01:54:14.173 --> 01:54:19.656]  Folks, if I sound a little hysterical, it's because I'm focused.
[01:54:19.656 --> 01:54:20.156]  I'm angry.
[01:54:20.156 --> 01:54:20.816]  I'm upset.
[01:54:20.816 --> 01:54:24.318]  We have these emotions, these instincts, for a reason.
[01:54:24.318 --> 01:54:28.320]  America's First Amendment is being shredded.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:33.363]  They are saying they want to adopt EU-style rules to arrest people that mildly criticize Islam.
[01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:40.128]  They are funding Antifa to go around and beat up prayer vigils and then saying that they're saints.
[01:54:40.128 --> 01:54:52.004]  They are blocking mainline Christian groups from commerce on Amazon with an illegal database from a Democratic Party-funded group, the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:57.252]  The ADL's lost a bunch of lawsuits for stuff like this previously.
[01:54:57.252 --> 01:55:04.195]  They think because of the law Obama signed, that we mentioned earlier with Jihad Watch, that they've got some type of immunity.
[01:55:05.049 --> 01:55:06.951]  But it's not covered by all the other laws.
[01:55:06.951 --> 01:55:07.932]  It's very specific.
[01:55:07.932 --> 01:55:09.233]  It's a fraud.
[01:55:09.233 --> 01:55:15.279]  And they can't sit there then and say everybody else can't discriminate if they're allowed to discriminate.
[01:55:15.279 --> 01:55:20.244]  Chuck, I want to get back to the Menendez trial here with the senator, but they're wide open.
[01:55:20.244 --> 01:55:22.246]  And as you said, whistleblowing is the key.
[01:55:22.246 --> 01:55:23.648]  But we've got to get really aggressive.
[01:55:24.793 --> 01:55:41.184]  We do, and you know, I've offered people, you know, bounties for if they have insider information at Facebook and Google, offer them rewards for coming forward and being whistleblowers, $10,000 if they have, you know, material about how Google manipulates its searches politically.
[01:55:41.184 --> 01:55:42.946]  I'm looking for insiders.
[01:55:42.946 --> 01:55:46.508]  I'm looking for people who want to be, you know, witnesses in congressional probes.
[01:55:46.508 --> 01:55:50.131]  I'm looking for people who want to be witnesses at the FTC.
[01:55:50.131 --> 01:55:53.273]  We need to start, you know, going very serious against these companies because
[01:55:53.564 --> 01:56:04.471]  You know, the Facebooks, Amazons, and Googles of the world, these are all companies that are much larger than Ma Bell was before antitrust regulation came down against them.
[01:56:04.471 --> 01:56:14.658]  And so I think, you know... And let's be clear, they're specifically saying Christians, conservatives, libertarians, and even targeting mainline groups now to set the precedent that they can ban anybody they want.
[01:56:15.874 --> 01:56:18.096]  Yeah, it's quite sick to watch how they're approaching it.
[01:56:18.096 --> 01:56:19.758]  You know, they're freaking out right now.
[01:56:19.758 --> 01:56:26.004]  You know, Google is working with a website called Backpage.com to try to stop Backpage from being shut down.
[01:56:26.004 --> 01:56:28.166]  It's essentially an escort service.
[01:56:28.166 --> 01:56:30.888]  Now, why would Google care about an escort service?
[01:56:30.888 --> 01:56:41.478]  Well, their fear is that when people start regulating dangerous things on the Internet, like actual, you know, actual human trafficking, this is something that they are very afraid of.
[01:56:42.566 --> 01:56:48.648]  And so this is becoming a very big problem, and it's something where we need to start pushing back against it.
[01:56:48.648 --> 01:56:49.048]  Exactly.
[01:56:49.048 --> 01:56:53.629]  They fight to keep really dangerous stuff, drug dealing sites, you name it, up.
[01:56:53.629 --> 01:57:02.032]  But then, at the same time, while they fight to keep, you know, Pornhub open and anything else they want, they don't want preachers to be able to sell their books on Amazon.
[01:57:02.032 --> 01:57:02.532]  That's right.
[01:57:02.532 --> 01:57:03.812]  That's exactly right.
[01:57:03.812 --> 01:57:04.952]  And it's scary, man.
[01:57:04.952 --> 01:57:05.853]  It needs to be called out.
[01:57:07.892 --> 01:57:18.519]  I would say, you know, one of the things that's become kind of disturbing to me about it is how the media works with a lot of these tech companies to smear and shame people and basically try to otherize them.
[01:57:18.519 --> 01:57:22.882]  And they've tried that with me, they've tried that obviously with you, making things up about what you've said.
[01:57:22.882 --> 01:57:27.125]  Yeah, making things up about what I've said, removing context, deleting things.
[01:57:27.125 --> 01:57:28.285]  I mean, it's really a shame.
[01:57:28.285 --> 01:57:32.448]  Oh, I love the anonymous stuff like they said about you anonymously crapping on the floor or something.
[01:57:32.448 --> 01:57:33.729]  They make up all the same stuff.
[01:57:34.369 --> 01:57:42.733]  It'll say, a guy said once he was walking down the hall in a movie theater and said he hated God, or said he didn't believe in any of it, or said he was a this or that.
[01:57:42.733 --> 01:57:46.595]  They just have these anonymous, made-up crap.
[01:57:46.595 --> 01:57:55.979]  Yeah, and it's interesting, you know, in the case of, you know, so Gawker smeared me, we sued them, Gawker's now in bankruptcy, we're still fighting them over to get a settlement out of them.
[01:57:55.979 --> 01:57:58.801]  I saw, they're offering you 1.5 million already, but that's not, yeah.
[01:57:59.898 --> 01:58:03.159]  Yeah, so there's been a fight over that, and we're going to see what's going to happen there.
[01:58:03.159 --> 01:58:08.401]  I promise the second I get that money, we're just going to pour it right into suing Twitter or suing one of these other companies.
[01:58:08.401 --> 01:58:09.761]  I have no need for it.
[01:58:09.761 --> 01:58:12.722]  I know we'll use the enemy's resources against them.
[01:58:12.722 --> 01:58:16.984]  It shows how crazy they are, because they just make up complete lies about me.
[01:58:16.984 --> 01:58:18.924]  And my lawyer goes, yes, you will win this suit.
[01:58:18.924 --> 01:58:20.145]  It'll just take you two years.
[01:58:20.145 --> 01:58:24.106]  I guess you've got a judgment 1.5 million right now, but you want more.
[01:58:24.106 --> 01:58:24.826]  I agree.
[01:58:24.826 --> 01:58:26.127]  I think you need a lot more.
[01:58:26.127 --> 01:58:26.947]  They just made up
[01:58:27.407 --> 01:58:29.908]  Horrible things just like they made up about Trump.
[01:58:29.908 --> 01:58:30.488]  Back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:30.488 --> 01:58:38.050]  I want to do five more minutes and finally get to the trial of the senator who is coming out reportedly molested children.
[01:58:38.050 --> 01:58:40.451]  Stay with us.
[01:58:40.451 --> 01:58:42.672]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[01:59:49.253 --> 01:59:51.895]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:09.161 --> 02:00:11.843]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:11.843 --> 02:00:18.787]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:00:18.787 --> 02:00:31.755]  Senator Robert Menendez, tell us about this case, why it's important and why Chuck Johnson is there covering it this week.
[02:00:31.755 --> 02:00:32.476]  Give us the details.
[02:00:33.587 --> 02:00:40.189]  Sure, I mean, in 2012, Matthew Boyle and I, at the Daily Caller, broke a story about a U.S.
[02:00:40.189 --> 02:00:43.150]  Senator who was sniffing underage prostitutes.
[02:00:43.150 --> 02:00:57.794]  And it ultimately led to a huge investigation about all the favors that the Senator was doing on behalf of his friends, this guy Salmon Melgen, who was running one of the largest Medicare frauds in American history.
[02:00:57.794 --> 02:01:02.655]  And they got, you know, Melgen got convicted on all 67 counts of Medicare fraud.
[02:01:03.295 --> 02:01:04.476]  And now the U.S.
[02:01:04.476 --> 02:01:19.221]  government is prosecuting Senator Menendez for all the corrupt things he did on behalf of his friend who gave him all this money, who went partying with him, went and visited all these women with him down in the Dominican Republic.
[02:01:20.101 --> 02:01:29.903]  And it's been a really interesting trial because Menendez tried to lie to people and say that he was, you know, pro, you know, he's basically against the Iran deal.
[02:01:29.903 --> 02:01:31.864]  He was a pro-Israel Democrat.
[02:01:31.864 --> 02:01:39.385]  So a lot of, um, a lot of, you know, pro-Israel people got conned and gave him a bunch of money for his legal defense.
[02:01:39.385 --> 02:01:42.186]  But now the trial is going on, it's going to last for six weeks.
[02:01:42.674 --> 02:01:48.639]  And I was the one who broke the story, and it was kind of crazy how it all happened.
[02:01:48.639 --> 02:01:54.765]  What about the reports I heard years ago of him being investigated, the allegations of underage?
[02:01:54.765 --> 02:01:58.028]  So the underage stuff, the feds are not bringing the claims against that.
[02:01:58.028 --> 02:02:05.955]  I've talked to some of the FBI agents about it, and their attitude was, look, we've got more than enough to put this guy away on just straight up bribery and graft.
[02:02:05.955 --> 02:02:09.618]  But, you know, Menendez is a co-defendant, Melgen,
[02:02:10.165 --> 02:02:13.146]  You know, he had all these girlfriends.
[02:02:13.146 --> 02:02:14.506]  Many of them look like escorts.
[02:02:14.506 --> 02:02:16.247]  They sound like escorts.
[02:02:16.247 --> 02:02:28.031]  And yesterday, Menendez's staffer testified that he worked with Menendez to bring in Melgen's girlfriends.
[02:02:28.031 --> 02:02:31.072]  And this, by the way, is a married guy.
[02:02:31.072 --> 02:02:34.973]  And he's bringing in all these women, basically bringing them in on their tourist visas.
[02:02:35.453 --> 02:02:38.355]  So the real question is, we know that he's doing this already.
[02:02:38.355 --> 02:02:41.537]  Those are just the ones that the government's brought the case on.
[02:02:41.537 --> 02:02:42.458]  Were there others?
[02:02:42.458 --> 02:02:46.501]  You know, we reported that there were in 2012.
[02:02:46.501 --> 02:02:47.901]  I was attacked by Newsweek.
[02:02:47.901 --> 02:02:53.225]  Newsweek used Menendez's smear and said that it was a Cuban intelligence plot.
[02:02:53.225 --> 02:02:55.186]  I was attacked for being anti-Israel.
[02:02:55.186 --> 02:02:56.928]  Of course I'm not.
[02:02:56.928 --> 02:02:59.849]  And I was smeared for months and for years.
[02:02:59.849 --> 02:03:03.472]  And then in 2015, the FBI came out and said that
[02:03:03.999 --> 02:03:09.230]  All the reporting that Matthew Boyle and I did was corroborated, was true.
[02:03:09.230 --> 02:03:13.098]  And so that's sort of a very fascinating place to be.
[02:03:13.098 --> 02:03:15.082]  And it continues to be kind of exciting.
[02:03:18.123 --> 02:03:20.805]  Chuck Johnson, let me ask you this final question.
[02:03:20.805 --> 02:03:23.126]  We look at Debbie Washington Schultz now.
[02:03:23.126 --> 02:03:31.091]  We have Representative Frank saying what we reported a week ago is accurate, that they're seeking immunity for significant, disturbing testimony against Debbie Washington Schultz.
[02:03:31.091 --> 02:03:31.852]  What's the intel?
[02:03:31.852 --> 02:03:36.655]  I know you've got your ear to the ground on what she's been up to.
[02:03:36.655 --> 02:03:39.637]  So, what I've been told is that it's not going to look good for her.
[02:03:39.637 --> 02:03:40.798]  Basically, what they did was
[02:03:41.630 --> 02:03:50.887]  They really allowed foreign Pakistani nationals to basically penetrate the entire IT system of the Democratic Party.
[02:03:51.727 --> 02:03:53.528]  And it's not looking good.
[02:03:53.528 --> 02:03:54.989]  It's not looking good at all.
[02:03:54.989 --> 02:04:13.641]  I think one of the problems that the Democrats have in general is because they're so addicted to foreign labor and they're so addicted to trying to human smuggle people into the country that they don't think about some of the security risks that some of these things pose, like with those brothers from Pakistan.
[02:04:13.641 --> 02:04:13.962]  That's right.
[02:04:14.522 --> 02:04:22.306]  They think, oh, somebody from a foreign government, like we know the Russians were in there too, and the Chinese, or the Office of Personnel hack that was 20 million people.
[02:04:22.306 --> 02:04:29.530]  I mean, they're the ones doing this, just everything's wide open, while they point their fingers at us and say we're secret Russian agents, when we're the opposite.
[02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:35.361]  No, and honestly, like, you know, I've never had any beef with Russia in my entire life.
[02:04:35.361 --> 02:04:36.081]  I wish them well.
[02:04:36.081 --> 02:04:42.243]  They have a lot of hot women and oil, you know, but I'm not paid by Russia for anything.
[02:04:42.243 --> 02:04:44.823]  Of course, it's the globalists that are selling the country out.
[02:04:44.823 --> 02:04:46.644]  Chuck Johnson, thank you so much.
[02:04:46.644 --> 02:04:47.924]  Amazing information.
[02:04:47.924 --> 02:04:50.685]  Join us again as more unfolds with this trial.
[02:04:50.685 --> 02:04:51.105]  We'll be back.
[02:04:53.450 --> 02:04:59.961]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.

[02:05:42.703 --> 02:05:43.944]  This is The War Room.
[02:05:55.229 --> 02:05:58.991]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:05:58.991 --> 02:06:06.714]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:06:06.714 --> 02:06:15.318]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:06:15.318 --> 02:06:19.380]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:20.901]  We're good to go.

[02:08:09.464 --> 02:08:14.969]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:14.969 --> 02:08:31.522]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:31.522 --> 02:08:36.186]  I wanted to get Professor James McCanny on for the next half hour.
[02:08:38.007 --> 02:08:53.185]  Because he's a high-level professor who has done a lot of different breakdowns on things that are happening in our environment, things that are happening in our atmosphere, things that are unfolding with weather modification, American geospatial.
[02:08:54.186 --> 02:08:56.589]  Union meetings and other things that he's been part of.
[02:08:56.589 --> 02:09:08.121]  I'm not going to go over his entire bio, but you can find out more at JMCCSCI.com or just Google Professor James McCanny.
[02:09:08.121 --> 02:09:08.861]  Before we go to him,
[02:09:10.023 --> 02:09:19.108]  Laura Loomer is going out today and she is, again, just a free-roving citizen journalist.
[02:09:19.108 --> 02:09:24.511]  She's intending to go to book signings with Hillary where they ask the question, what happened?
[02:09:24.511 --> 02:09:27.633]  She's going to ask her, what happened at Benghazi?
[02:09:27.633 --> 02:09:28.193]  What happened?
[02:09:29.795 --> 02:09:31.917]  With the servers, things like that.
[02:09:31.917 --> 02:09:45.087]  She's going to be joining us, and we now have the excerpts we'll be playing, because the book on tape just came out a few days ago, the excerpts of Hillary attacking yours truly in InfoWars, in the book, with her own voice, narrating it.
[02:09:45.087 --> 02:09:57.657]  It's very grating, but we're going to be playing that coming up a little bit later towards the end of this hour, and then Paul Watson from London, England, will be hosting the fourth hour with masses of key breaking news.
[02:09:58.649 --> 02:10:00.050]  Now, I want to be clear.
[02:10:00.050 --> 02:10:13.577]  Every time I cover a subject like this, the media misrepresents and says that I am, you know, saying for sure that this is weather modified or that the government did this, the government did that.
[02:10:13.577 --> 02:10:16.719]  All I know is they admit they've got a lot of these systems.
[02:10:16.719 --> 02:10:26.024]  The former Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, back in April of 1997, gave a press conference and admitted it.
[02:10:26.024 --> 02:10:26.224]  So,
[02:10:27.526 --> 02:10:29.388]  We should have a debate about this.
[02:10:29.388 --> 02:10:53.250]  The ultimate class system is this whole national security and now global security system, where the upper class gets into the cult of secret government corporations, and then they travel up that to the corporate or military ladder, and then they get access to what's going on, at least pieces of it, but the public doesn't, and only the people up at the very, very top get to then see how all the pieces are fitting together.
[02:10:54.611 --> 02:10:55.892]  That's real discrimination.
[02:10:55.892 --> 02:10:57.493]  That's control of knowledge.
[02:10:57.493 --> 02:10:59.834]  And Professor James McKinney breaks that down.
[02:10:59.834 --> 02:11:11.942]  I'm not going to go over all the things he's done and all the things he's been involved in, but I'd like to just get his general take on where we are globally right now.
[02:11:11.942 --> 02:11:13.563]  We've got all the Kuiper Belt objects.
[02:11:13.563 --> 02:11:16.025]  They're now admitting more of those come into the solar system.
[02:11:16.025 --> 02:11:18.306]  We've got massive record earthquakes.
[02:11:18.306 --> 02:11:19.287]  Mexico is going to help.
[02:11:20.330 --> 02:11:25.431]  in the situation in Texas with Harvey until they got hit with the biggest earthquake in their history.
[02:11:25.431 --> 02:11:26.972]  Why does all this connect together?
[02:11:26.972 --> 02:11:29.512]  What's going on with the other sign?
[02:11:29.512 --> 02:11:30.593]  We'll get his perspective.
[02:11:30.593 --> 02:11:35.894]  We've been having astrophysicists on lately, you name it, to give us their take.
[02:11:35.894 --> 02:11:38.595]  So, Professor James McKinney, thanks for coming on.
[02:11:38.595 --> 02:11:39.275]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:11:39.275 --> 02:11:40.876]  Thanks for having me here.
[02:11:40.876 --> 02:11:43.476]  So, you're really the super expert on everything.
[02:11:43.476 --> 02:11:46.137]  Give us your breakdown just on what you think is most important.
[02:11:47.335 --> 02:11:58.607]  Well, Alex, I worked with Russian scientists in the mid-1990s, and what we developed were systems, two systems, for degrading hurricanes, leading them offshore.
[02:11:58.607 --> 02:12:00.469]  And this information was given to the U.S.
[02:12:00.469 --> 02:12:03.272]  military because Russia really doesn't have a problem with hurricanes.
[02:12:03.272 --> 02:12:03.532]  We do.
[02:12:04.412 --> 02:12:05.012]  And the U.S.
[02:12:05.012 --> 02:12:10.215]  military, we knew that they had militarized this information in the early 2000s.
[02:12:10.215 --> 02:12:12.836]  They sent up three large satellites.
[02:12:12.836 --> 02:12:14.537]  They said they were for communications.
[02:12:14.537 --> 02:12:17.019]  We knew that they were laser satellites.
[02:12:17.019 --> 02:12:19.520]  And they have been using these to manipulate storms.
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:23.142]  That's when the serious storm manipulation problem began.
[02:12:23.142 --> 02:12:32.427]  And the way they do this, hurricanes, we first have to dispel this myth that hurricanes are somehow created and maintained by warm water.
[02:12:32.427 --> 02:12:33.307]  Totally incorrect.
[02:12:33.951 --> 02:12:46.485]  The hurricanes are powered by electrical currents from the ionosphere and what we learned is how to enhance and use those currents to steer hurricanes away from shore and away from harm of the public.
[02:12:46.485 --> 02:12:55.735]  Now they're using these and you could see it with Hurricane Irma was built and designed in the eastern Atlantic and just guided across
[02:12:56.468 --> 02:13:05.376]  That's why these hurricane models supposedly predicted where they were going to go up Florida days, almost a week in advance.
[02:13:05.376 --> 02:13:06.417]  It's absurd.
[02:13:06.417 --> 02:13:17.346]  But this was one of the most manipulated guided storms I've ever seen, along with Hurricane Katrina, which was a totally manipulated storm for maximum destruction.
[02:13:17.346 --> 02:13:24.072]  This was to destroy Florida, evacuate Florida, just as Hurricane Harvey was to destroy Houston.
[02:13:25.558 --> 02:13:40.071]  You know, we could pull up time-lapse of Hurricane Katrina's satellite, or also radar composites, and it comes in out of the Atlantic, it goes up the side, sits there and waits a couple days, and then races across and goes right into Louisiana.
[02:13:40.071 --> 02:13:41.492]  And again, I had Ben Livingston on.
[02:13:42.478 --> 02:13:47.342]  The father of a lot of our modern weather weapons, and it was declassified.
[02:13:47.342 --> 02:13:49.863]  I saw his name in a newspaper, called him, got him on.
[02:13:49.863 --> 02:13:53.966]  He got a visit a week after, and he told me, he said, I can't ever talk to anybody again.
[02:13:53.966 --> 02:13:54.967]  They've reclassified it.
[02:13:54.967 --> 02:13:56.148]  They just threatened me.
[02:13:56.148 --> 02:14:07.136]  But he said they had systems that control hurricanes and steer them or kill them back in the 1960s.
[02:14:07.136 --> 02:14:08.577]  What you have is a low-pressure cell.
[02:14:09.555 --> 02:14:16.381]  And part of the manipulation is to manipulate the public into believing that this is caused by warm water.
[02:14:16.381 --> 02:14:24.428]  And so if the public doesn't understand the true nature of hurricanes, now we're seeing on the screen here, look at the eye, is this Katrina?
[02:14:24.428 --> 02:14:25.749]  I'm assuming this is Katrina.
[02:14:25.749 --> 02:14:27.010]  Yes.
[02:14:27.010 --> 02:14:36.879]  Yeah, it came in and I just read some analysis from some weather reporters, how they were totally taken by surprise at the path and the strength of Katrina.
[02:14:37.399 --> 02:14:40.883]  It was totally off the records.
[02:14:40.883 --> 02:14:43.386]  It was totally out of control.
[02:14:43.386 --> 02:14:48.072]  But it was being controlled for maximum destruction of New Orleans.
[02:14:48.072 --> 02:14:53.298]  And look, we have no record of maybe millions of people that were in New Orleans.
[02:14:53.298 --> 02:14:54.440]  I used to live in New Orleans.
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:56.102]  I went to Tulane for grad school.
[02:14:56.922 --> 02:14:59.485]  And I wrote all around the levees.
[02:14:59.485 --> 02:15:06.571]  Hurricane Katrina had already passed New Orleans when they blew the levee in seven places.
[02:15:06.571 --> 02:15:13.116]  The flooding was a result of blown levees from explosions, not from back surge from Hurricane Katrina.
[02:15:13.116 --> 02:15:19.862]  And you're saying it was used for social engineering, I guess as an example of how to use weather weapons to then clear an area?
[02:15:21.187 --> 02:15:21.867]  Exactly.
[02:15:21.867 --> 02:15:24.308]  We don't know what happened.
[02:15:24.308 --> 02:15:27.388]  Possibly a million people in New Orleans we have no record of.
[02:15:27.388 --> 02:15:30.189]  By the way, they called it a conspiracy theory that levees got blown.
[02:15:30.189 --> 02:15:33.209]  They later admitted that they did release some of the levees.
[02:15:33.209 --> 02:15:35.830]  They did indeed blow some of the levees.
[02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:39.591]  Yeah, I rode my bicycle around those levees as a student.
[02:15:39.591 --> 02:15:42.131]  I know those levees like the back of my hand.
[02:15:42.131 --> 02:15:50.013]  And for the concept that these were destroyed by a back surge off Lake Pontchartrain,
[02:15:50.632 --> 02:15:52.274]  Totally absurd.
[02:15:52.274 --> 02:15:55.900]  These were blown to flood the city because New Orleans is under flood.
[02:15:55.900 --> 02:15:58.323]  These levees, you can, like you said, a bicycle, they're like, what, 10, 12 feet wide?
[02:15:59.850 --> 02:16:00.990]  Oh yeah, they're massive.
[02:16:00.990 --> 02:16:01.771]  They're massive.
[02:16:01.771 --> 02:16:05.952]  Yeah, a hurricane surge is not going to take these levees out.
[02:16:05.952 --> 02:16:12.994]  And we know that they were blown in the lower wards where the... By the way, we know gun confiscation happened.
[02:16:12.994 --> 02:16:14.114]  They denied that for a week.
[02:16:14.114 --> 02:16:15.255]  It was later admitted.
[02:16:15.255 --> 02:16:16.735]  And just like the U.S.
[02:16:16.735 --> 02:16:19.356]  Virgin Islands confiscated all the guns, the U.S.
[02:16:19.356 --> 02:16:23.317]  Virgin Islands governor took the guns just last week again.
[02:16:24.386 --> 02:16:31.269]  Right, and there's again Hurricane Irma destroyed these islands and there was no need to do this.
[02:16:31.269 --> 02:16:40.113]  Now Irma was a perfect example where they could have used the same technology to direct the storm north into the center of the Atlantic completely out of harm's way.
[02:16:40.817 --> 02:16:42.178]  And they drug it across.
[02:16:42.178 --> 02:16:54.330]  Interestingly enough, they brought it way north of Puerto Rico and then brought it back down into Hispanola to Dominican Republic, Haiti, and then Cuba for maximum destruction.
[02:16:54.330 --> 02:17:00.316]  And then it takes a right turn exactly perfectly to come up the west coast of Florida.
[02:17:00.316 --> 02:17:03.139]  And they did that to maximize the energy.
[02:17:04.392 --> 02:17:06.733]  And the storm surge.
[02:17:06.733 --> 02:17:07.894]  But they made a mistake.
[02:17:07.894 --> 02:17:10.955]  They could not maintain the energy in the storm.
[02:17:10.955 --> 02:17:12.136]  You could see them pulling it.
[02:17:12.136 --> 02:17:14.057]  I've posted a picture, by the way, on my web page.
[02:17:14.057 --> 02:17:19.880]  Well, isn't that because they're even admitting that because those bays are so shallow that they didn't get enough water?
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:20.460]  Yeah.
[02:17:20.460 --> 02:17:20.780]  Yeah.
[02:17:20.780 --> 02:17:27.544]  And the other thing, they made Irma so big that it dumped most of its water out in the ocean.
[02:17:27.544 --> 02:17:28.805]  So it didn't have much rain.
[02:17:28.805 --> 02:17:31.766]  It was a dry hurricane by the time it got to Tampa.
[02:17:31.766 --> 02:17:33.387]  So it did not have much momentum.
[02:17:34.185 --> 02:17:36.187]  And so they failed.
[02:17:36.187 --> 02:17:46.138]  You could see them bringing it into shore and bringing it back out into the into the bays along the west coast of Florida, trying to bring up energy, drive up energy.
[02:17:46.138 --> 02:17:49.802]  And you could see the distortion in the eye as they were doing this.
[02:17:49.802 --> 02:17:50.583]  But they failed.
[02:17:50.583 --> 02:17:52.385]  It shorted out.
[02:17:53.005 --> 02:17:56.551]  It did not have much of a storm surge and it had very little water.
[02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:16.491]  Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B. Chemical, biological, radiological, weather.
[02:18:16.491 --> 02:18:20.732]  Any type of secret testing as long as it's for research purposes.
[02:18:20.732 --> 02:18:22.513]  So it's never operational.
[02:18:22.513 --> 02:18:26.314]  All these giant programs, they still call them research.
[02:18:26.314 --> 02:18:29.555]  Just like Tuskegee injecting black people with syphilis.
[02:18:30.592 --> 02:18:38.814]  Well, if nothing else, they should have steered this storm northwards, in the Atlantic, away from any harm.
[02:18:38.814 --> 02:18:41.395]  So I know they have the ability to do this.
[02:18:41.395 --> 02:18:42.855]  So why didn't they do this?
[02:18:42.855 --> 02:18:50.837]  Why did they direct it into Florida and then Governor Rick Scott and CNN pounding, everybody has to evacuate, everybody has to evacuate.
[02:18:50.837 --> 02:18:53.438]  They were going for maximum damage in Florida.
[02:18:54.188 --> 02:18:57.209]  And, uh, that would have depopulated Florida.
[02:18:57.209 --> 02:18:59.389]  As it turns out, a lot of people stayed.
[02:18:59.389 --> 02:19:00.909]  There are people back in business.
[02:19:00.909 --> 02:19:04.470]  I know people in Tampa that are back at the office today.
[02:19:04.470 --> 02:19:06.090]  And, uh, so they failed.
[02:19:06.090 --> 02:19:09.091]  They failed at their objective.
[02:19:09.091 --> 02:19:13.272]  It's incredible to see Tampa Bay and other areas that Liam McAdoo shot video as well.
[02:19:13.272 --> 02:19:17.032]  Walking out hundreds of yards, there's no water.
[02:19:17.032 --> 02:19:17.572]  Right.
[02:19:17.572 --> 02:19:18.213]  Yeah.
[02:19:18.213 --> 02:19:20.053]  And there was no storm surge.
[02:19:20.972 --> 02:19:27.230]  Uh, it was very minimal, and so all of that underground infrastructure that should have been damaged was not.
[02:19:28.294 --> 02:19:29.355]  Incredible.
[02:19:29.355 --> 02:19:31.457]  Professor James McCanney is our guest.
[02:19:31.457 --> 02:19:36.100]  We're going to get his view on, though a lot of this is secret, what's the big picture?
[02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:38.582]  And I want to be clear, I'm not saying this is controlled.
[02:19:38.582 --> 02:19:40.404]  I'm not saying I disagree with him.
[02:19:40.404 --> 02:19:41.445]  I'm not saying I agree.
[02:19:41.445 --> 02:19:42.525]  I think it's open for discussion.
[02:19:42.525 --> 02:19:43.446]  He's a smart professor.
[02:19:43.446 --> 02:19:46.128]  He's done a lot of research and we're getting his view on this.
[02:19:46.128 --> 02:19:50.212]  But we know they've got weather modification and they're manipulating hurricanes.
[02:19:50.212 --> 02:19:51.613]  Why aren't they knocking them out to sea?
[02:19:52.509 --> 02:19:59.475]  By now you know that wireless technology like cell phones do in fact pose dangers to the health and privacy of everyone.

[02:20:52.165 --> 02:21:07.722]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information, and in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much
[02:21:07.782 --> 02:21:08.022]  I think?
[02:21:26.042 --> 02:21:26.502]  We're good.

[02:24:03.290 --> 02:24:10.112]  Coming up, Hillary Clinton's new book's out, and she attacks me six times in it, and she did an audiobook for us.
[02:24:10.112 --> 02:24:11.133]  We're going to be playing those.
[02:24:11.133 --> 02:24:16.994]  Remember, she called me the dark heart, and she said that I lost her the election?
[02:24:16.994 --> 02:24:19.435]  And what's crazy is, you lost her the election.
[02:24:19.435 --> 02:24:20.975]  You voted against her.
[02:24:20.975 --> 02:24:21.876]  Not the Russians.
[02:24:21.876 --> 02:24:24.676]  I mean, I did vote against her.
[02:24:24.676 --> 02:24:30.218]  But again, they want to make the symbol Alex Jones blame me, and then try to destroy me,
[02:24:31.368 --> 02:24:33.810]  In some media ritual.
[02:24:33.810 --> 02:24:34.511]  It's not gonna work.
[02:24:34.511 --> 02:24:40.095]  That article's up on InfoWars.com with the video, with the audio, and with the transcript of her new book.
[02:24:40.095 --> 02:24:42.577]  Hillary Clinton obsessed with Alex Jones' new book.
[02:24:42.577 --> 02:24:56.329]  So I love how they're attacking me everywhere, trying to destroy me everywhere, and then trying to censor me while they create all these straw men characters on TV that say, I'm Alex Jones reporting, and I don't like such and such, and then say something bigoted.
[02:24:57.037 --> 02:25:04.521]  I mean, the fact that it works on leftist TV viewers is terrifying.
[02:25:04.521 --> 02:25:05.801]  Dead.
[02:25:05.801 --> 02:25:09.083]  This is the level of their constituent.
[02:25:09.083 --> 02:25:13.465]  They don't play what I ever say when Tom Brokaw says I'm a deep racist.
[02:25:13.465 --> 02:25:14.305]  Or a complete racist.
[02:25:14.305 --> 02:25:16.086]  They just say I am.
[02:25:16.086 --> 02:25:17.507]  As if the thing makes it so.
[02:25:17.507 --> 02:25:19.188]  Like, I am Puff the Magic Dragon.
[02:25:19.188 --> 02:25:21.369]  No, I'm not.
[02:25:21.369 --> 02:25:22.569]  Alex Jones is a Nazi.
[02:25:22.569 --> 02:25:23.130]  No, I'm not.
[02:25:23.130 --> 02:25:25.171]  Alex Jones is a purple walrus.
[02:25:25.171 --> 02:25:25.591]  No, I'm not.
[02:25:28.001 --> 02:25:32.483]  The fact is, Professor James McCanney is right.
[02:25:32.483 --> 02:25:33.744]  There are weather weapons.
[02:25:33.744 --> 02:25:34.404]  It's admitted.
[02:25:34.404 --> 02:25:35.725]  They've got it.
[02:25:35.725 --> 02:25:42.668]  And I love how it's all over the news in foreign countries that they've got ionizing systems on the ground, jets, spray planes.
[02:25:42.668 --> 02:25:43.249]  They're doing it.
[02:25:43.249 --> 02:25:45.590]  They admit it in Dubai and China.
[02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:47.851]  But here, they just say, oh, you're crazy.
[02:25:47.851 --> 02:25:51.293]  So in the few minutes we've got left, I want to invite you up for a full hour in the near future.
[02:25:53.695 --> 02:25:54.976]  What's really going on?
[02:25:54.976 --> 02:25:57.177]  I mean, so much of this is secret.
[02:25:57.177 --> 02:26:00.618]  We know it's going on, but what's the endgame?
[02:26:00.618 --> 02:26:04.000]  Well, Alex, I believe that they lost the election.
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.521]  They don't know what to do with Trump.
[02:26:05.521 --> 02:26:09.623]  This is a symbol of desperate people doing desperate things.
[02:26:09.623 --> 02:26:11.324]  My view is this is the deep state.
[02:26:11.324 --> 02:26:13.084]  This is clearly the U.S.
[02:26:13.084 --> 02:26:15.986]  military that is in control of this.
[02:26:15.986 --> 02:26:18.807]  And we're looking at two population centers.
[02:26:18.807 --> 02:26:20.368]  What I am worried about
[02:26:21.068 --> 02:26:32.673]  Are other things like the Canary Islands forcing a landslide or causing earthquakes on the New Madras fault line or the San Andreas or messing with Yellowstone.
[02:26:32.673 --> 02:26:43.117]  We already know that NASA has proposed pumping steam into Yellowstone and luckily the Park Service has said stay away.
[02:26:43.117 --> 02:26:47.839]  But that would create the biggest volcanic explosion we've ever seen in the world.
[02:26:48.959 --> 02:26:50.380]  Exactly!
[02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:52.321]  That was in the Associated Press.
[02:26:52.321 --> 02:26:59.584]  Why, if a super caldera is going on, would you pump steam back in it, knowing that that's what causes it to explode?
[02:26:59.584 --> 02:27:04.986]  Well, they think it's the gas that's in the volcano.
[02:27:04.986 --> 02:27:07.748]  Standard theory says that that's what causes the explosion.
[02:27:07.748 --> 02:27:13.170]  No, it's when the water goes down, hits the magma, and you've got the biggest steam engine on the planet.
[02:27:13.795 --> 02:27:19.390]  But I'm worried about false flag EMPs where they shut down, they pull the electrical grid.
[02:27:22.156 --> 02:27:27.738]  The number of rabbits that they have in their hats, but these are desperate people doing desperate things.
[02:27:27.738 --> 02:27:31.420]  And of course, the Pentagon's got the 20-year-old document owning the weather by 2025.
[02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:33.240]  I mean, they don't hide that.
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:34.121]  Absolutely.
[02:27:34.121 --> 02:27:36.442]  No, this is absolutely here.
[02:27:36.442 --> 02:27:40.483]  There's no question that Hurricane Irma was manipulated.
[02:27:40.483 --> 02:27:44.105]  Look, the other thing is you need a real energy system to drive these storms.
[02:27:44.105 --> 02:27:46.786]  There was no natural existing energy system.
[02:27:46.786 --> 02:27:47.426]  That's my next question.
[02:27:47.426 --> 02:27:50.007]  Are they using aerosols or electromagnetic ground-based?
[02:27:50.933 --> 02:27:52.915]  Well, this is from laser satellites.
[02:27:52.915 --> 02:27:56.218]  What they do is they enhance the electrical currents that are driving the storm.
[02:27:56.218 --> 02:27:58.079]  Now, I know you've been saying that for 20 years.
[02:27:58.079 --> 02:28:00.702]  All I could ever prove was ground-based and air-based.
[02:28:00.702 --> 02:28:06.787]  Now they've got the movie Superstorm or Geostorm coming out, where it is space-based lasers, just like you first said.
[02:28:06.787 --> 02:28:08.929]  Yeah, and I developed the techniques.
[02:28:08.929 --> 02:28:13.193]  I developed the processes, and the idea was to steer these away from land.
[02:28:13.860 --> 02:28:17.023]  And you can see it when they talk about double walls.
[02:28:17.023 --> 02:28:20.245]  This is the stretching of the eye due to the laser.
[02:28:20.245 --> 02:28:21.866]  And even the news media... You know, I forgot.
[02:28:21.866 --> 02:28:27.591]  How many years ago did I hear you on, was it Coast to Coast, your own show, talking about space-based lasers?
[02:28:27.591 --> 02:28:32.795]  And either you're right about that or they copied you for the new movie Geostorm.
[02:28:32.795 --> 02:28:36.077]  Because, I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:28:36.077 --> 02:28:37.098]  I mean, it's wild.
[02:28:38.066 --> 02:28:43.672]  Yeah, but that's, like I say, you have to first understand hurricanes are not driven by warm water.
[02:28:43.672 --> 02:28:44.493]  That's ludicrous.
[02:28:44.493 --> 02:28:50.299]  That's like saying that the gas coming out of your tailpipe pushes your car down the road.
[02:28:50.299 --> 02:28:51.440]  It's ludicrous.
[02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:53.943]  But they keep driving this... What are they driven by?
[02:28:53.943 --> 02:28:55.365]  Usually solar radiation coming in?
[02:28:56.187 --> 02:29:05.049]  Well, the Earth has electrical fields between the ionosphere and the ground, and typically they're blocked by the dielectric properties of the atmosphere.
[02:29:05.049 --> 02:29:22.314]  But when you get these big cloud systems rolling off Africa, it's like a finger sticking up, and once that electrical discharge begins, that's when the hurricane, the ice form, the ionization... So basically really tall clouds pierce the Earth's atmosphere shield and bring in the space particle electricity.
[02:29:22.634 --> 02:29:28.196]  Yep, and if you learn how, if that's the process, and you enhance that with a laser, you're driving the hurricane.
[02:29:28.196 --> 02:29:28.696]  You can leave it around.
[02:29:28.696 --> 02:29:34.077]  So I get it, the lasers those punch a hole through simply for the connection to begin.
[02:29:34.077 --> 02:29:36.818]  You enhance the electrical current.
[02:29:36.818 --> 02:29:37.678]  That's what you're doing.
[02:29:37.678 --> 02:29:41.279]  Do five more minutes with me if you can, because I'm going to play the trailer for Geostorm.
[02:29:41.279 --> 02:29:41.799]  It's coming up.
[02:29:41.799 --> 02:29:45.540]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:45.540 --> 02:29:48.221]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:53.211 --> 02:29:59.293]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com is writing about it.
[02:29:59.293 --> 02:30:08.537]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[02:30:08.537 --> 02:30:10.878]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh
[02:30:11.078 --> 02:30:12.258]  On the grasshoppers.
[02:30:12.258 --> 02:30:15.499]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune, if they can make money.
[02:30:15.499 --> 02:30:22.200]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:26.681]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[02:30:26.681 --> 02:30:34.103]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[02:30:34.463 --> 02:30:42.928]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasion.
[02:30:42.928 --> 02:30:48.911]  Prepare for the worst-case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best-case scenario.
[02:30:48.911 --> 02:30:51.792]  Get more information at InfoWars.com.
[02:30:51.792 --> 02:30:52.333]  I'm David Knight.
[02:30:53.140 --> 02:31:01.867]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[02:31:01.867 --> 02:31:02.407]  That's right.
[02:31:02.407 --> 02:31:07.672]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[02:31:07.672 --> 02:31:14.357]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use.
[02:31:14.357 --> 02:31:21.623]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[02:31:21.923 --> 02:31:22.163]  Woo!
[02:31:22.163 --> 02:31:23.203]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:31:23.203 --> 02:31:31.946]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:31:31.946 --> 02:31:41.529]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:31:41.529 --> 02:31:44.970]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[02:31:44.970 --> 02:31:49.091]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[02:31:49.091 --> 02:31:49.931]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:31:50.151 --> 02:31:52.713]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:07.304 --> 02:32:13.749]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:32:13.749 --> 02:32:17.031]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[02:32:33.323 --> 02:32:35.365]  Iodine, nano, silver, and more.
[02:32:35.365 --> 02:32:43.653]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spiramin was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is Spiramin free.
[02:32:43.653 --> 02:32:51.961]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[02:33:02.210 --> 02:33:06.381]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:33:06.381 --> 02:33:08.106]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:15.513 --> 02:33:19.834]  I've been hearing Professor James McKinney for, it's gotta be 20 years.
[02:33:19.834 --> 02:33:23.475]  I'm going from memory, I think he's been on the show before, but I gotta be honest.
[02:33:23.475 --> 02:33:33.398]  I remember him talking, and I know he's a big engineer and worked for all these big companies, and spoke at these big, you know, geophysical union meetings and all the rest of it, and lectured at Los Alamos Laboratory.
[02:33:33.398 --> 02:33:34.338]  I mean, he's the real deal.
[02:33:34.338 --> 02:33:43.741]  But I'd hear him talk about, they've got space-based systems with lasers, and then that drives the hurricanes and then allows the connectivity, and back then I was like, that just sounded too fancy.
[02:33:44.821 --> 02:33:58.130]  But then as I interviewed astrophysicists and everybody else, they explained that the atmosphere keeps all that ionizing radiation and all these different types of particles and different types of energy from getting into the Earth.
[02:33:58.130 --> 02:34:05.875]  And now they have CBS News shows, as I'm showing on TV here, where CBS admits weather modification lasers are in operation.
[02:34:05.875 --> 02:34:14.201]  And then on CBS they say we have, in fact let's try to cue that up later, mega lasers, they say these super high-powered lasers,
[02:34:15.151 --> 02:34:20.093]  Where we control the storms and where we can destroy the storms or make them bigger.
[02:34:20.093 --> 02:34:25.315]  And the CBS host says to the professor, famous physics professor, well wait, you mean in the laboratory?
[02:34:25.315 --> 02:34:27.316]  He goes, oh yes, of course, laboratory.
[02:34:27.316 --> 02:34:32.778]  So then I would think back to McKinney talking about the Russians and the lasers and all the rest of it.
[02:34:32.778 --> 02:34:40.601]  Again, it's that the laser, even if it's ground-based to be super powerful, space-based, moderately so, opens up that channel simply for
[02:34:41.761 --> 02:34:43.222]  The connection.
[02:34:43.222 --> 02:34:51.765]  So whether it's one little copper wire or one little laser, it still allows, I guess, the trough to open is what I've been now actually reading the physics.
[02:34:51.765 --> 02:34:53.846]  I'm not a physics guy.
[02:34:53.846 --> 02:34:56.668]  I can now understand it, I guess, at 43 years old.
[02:34:56.668 --> 02:34:57.928]  And then it's like, oh, I get it.
[02:34:57.928 --> 02:35:00.129]  Because I was like, why don't have ground base doing it?
[02:35:00.129 --> 02:35:04.111]  It needs to be up in space to open the channel instead of shooting up through all the water.
[02:35:04.631 --> 02:35:07.173]  It's like 10 feet of water on average up into space.
[02:35:07.173 --> 02:35:14.758]  If you condense the atmosphere, you've got to open it up from the top where it's clean, it's a lot easier to pierce, and then it makes the connection.
[02:35:14.758 --> 02:35:25.506]  So now, I remember this guy on shows 15, 20 years ago talking about it and rolling my eyes, and then now, wow, they've got this film coming out in like a month, and I'm not advertising for it.
[02:35:25.506 --> 02:35:26.147]  I'm just showing
[02:35:27.438 --> 02:35:31.424]  This is everything everybody's been talking about and now here it is.
[02:35:31.424 --> 02:35:38.315]  What is it like to see Josh Brolin and all these other big stars in a movie about world government and weather terrorism?
[02:35:38.315 --> 02:35:38.736]  Here it is.
[02:35:38.736 --> 02:35:42.281]  Free Weather Alert.
[02:35:45.029 --> 02:35:50.330]  Senate Committee will now hear from Jacob Lawson, Climate ISS Chief Coordinator.
[02:35:50.330 --> 02:35:53.651]  May the record reflect that he was nearly one hour late.
[02:35:53.651 --> 02:35:54.892]  Yeah, sorry about that.
[02:35:54.892 --> 02:35:59.973]  I literally had to fly in from outer space.
[02:35:59.973 --> 02:36:08.656]  Thanks to the system of satellites, natural disasters have become a thing of the past.
[02:36:08.656 --> 02:36:09.996]  We can control our weather.
[02:36:11.843 --> 02:36:17.126]  Mr. President, one of our thermospheric satellites malfunctioned over Afghanistan.
[02:36:17.126 --> 02:36:18.387]  So your proposal is what?
[02:36:18.387 --> 02:36:20.968]  We shut down all satellites.
[02:36:20.968 --> 02:36:24.490]  I don't need to remind all of you how many people died from catastrophic climate conditions.
[02:36:24.490 --> 02:36:26.651]  Make sure there's no further incidents.
[02:36:26.651 --> 02:36:28.732]  Are you going back up to space?
[02:36:28.732 --> 02:36:29.973]  I'm going back.
[02:36:29.973 --> 02:36:31.914]  I promise.
[02:36:31.914 --> 02:36:33.055]  Have a safe trip, sir.
[02:36:33.055 --> 02:36:35.756]  Just don't touch anything.
[02:36:35.756 --> 02:36:36.376]  Main engine started.
[02:36:40.234 --> 02:36:42.015]  This is Mr. Jake Lawson.
[02:36:42.015 --> 02:36:42.675]  Me?
[02:36:42.675 --> 02:36:43.575]  Jake Lawson?
[02:36:43.575 --> 02:36:46.837]  You look much older than I would have thought.
[02:36:46.837 --> 02:36:49.958]  I mean, you look good.
[02:36:49.958 --> 02:36:52.359]  Am I getting fired?
[02:36:52.359 --> 02:36:53.800]  My access has been blocked.
[02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:55.621]  So Sally has a bad con, that happens.
[02:36:55.621 --> 02:37:00.923]  Not a Sally.
[02:37:00.923 --> 02:37:02.424]  This wasn't a malfunction.
[02:37:02.424 --> 02:37:03.124]  It was intentional.
[02:37:06.189 --> 02:37:07.050]  So let's just stop right there.
[02:37:07.050 --> 02:37:08.791]  You watch the trailer, it shows UN troops all over the world.
[02:37:08.791 --> 02:37:12.774]  That's the condition you have UN, not just in blue helmets, but blue uniforms.
[02:37:21.525 --> 02:37:22.385]  Okay.
[02:37:22.385 --> 02:37:25.526]  And it just shows a global authority dealing with the problem.
[02:37:25.526 --> 02:37:26.527]  So it's all conditioning.
[02:37:26.527 --> 02:37:27.547]  They're just rolling it out.
[02:37:27.547 --> 02:37:32.008]  And I got to say, James McHaney, you sounded sincere.
[02:37:32.008 --> 02:37:34.029]  I did research over the years.
[02:37:34.029 --> 02:37:37.710]  And then now you were the first guy I heard talk about space-based control.
[02:37:37.710 --> 02:37:38.490]  Now I get it.
[02:37:38.490 --> 02:37:40.311]  Spend a few more minutes talking about this.
[02:37:42.032 --> 02:37:45.254]  Alex, you hit it right in the head when you talked about the funnel.
[02:37:45.254 --> 02:37:48.635]  See, the dielectric of the atmosphere, and this is what Tesla was doing.
[02:37:48.635 --> 02:37:52.037]  Tesla, back in the early 1900s, was tapping into this.
[02:37:52.037 --> 02:37:54.538]  That's what he was using his Tesla towers for.
[02:37:54.538 --> 02:38:01.942]  They were a mechanism for, down on the planet Earth, drilling up through what I call drilling through the atmosphere.
[02:38:01.942 --> 02:38:05.524]  And once you do, you can unload that power, electrical power.
[02:38:05.524 --> 02:38:06.564]  It's like a space elevator.
[02:38:06.564 --> 02:38:10.106]  We know the FBI raided him, was probably killed working for J.P.
[02:38:10.106 --> 02:38:10.386]  Morgan.
[02:38:10.726 --> 02:38:13.167]  Rated him to get all his technology.
[02:38:13.167 --> 02:38:16.589]  Exactly, and it was George Bush Sr.
[02:38:16.589 --> 02:38:19.911]  who was in that when he was a young guy.
[02:38:19.911 --> 02:38:29.496]  Him and what's the guy's name, Skorodinsky, who actually supposedly suffocated Tesla and George Bush Sr.
[02:38:29.496 --> 02:38:30.677]  Well that was out in Colorado.
[02:38:32.589 --> 02:38:36.432]  No, the Tesla died in his New York hotel room.
[02:38:36.432 --> 02:38:39.434]  Sure, sure, but I'm saying they also seized everything out in Colorado.
[02:38:39.434 --> 02:38:41.896]  Exactly, and took down the Wardenclyffe Tower.
[02:38:41.896 --> 02:38:44.578]  They said to keep it from the Germans.
[02:38:44.578 --> 02:38:47.020]  Well, that was ridiculous.
[02:38:47.020 --> 02:38:51.464]  They took it down because it was a way to get free energy from not
[02:38:51.984 --> 02:39:01.429]  In the sense of putting a box on the table and getting free energy, but literally getting existing massive amounts of energy to drive technology.
[02:39:01.429 --> 02:39:09.653]  And by the way, they now admit this in all the major tech publications and science, that they can put big satellites out there that grab the radiation of the sun, not just the regular heat.
[02:39:09.653 --> 02:39:16.017]  But again, once you're not having the atmosphere, our defensive bubble, it's how many times more strong on average out in space?
[02:39:17.094 --> 02:39:18.796]  Oh, it's a tremendous amount.
[02:39:18.796 --> 02:39:22.999]  You have the entire spectrum, because we're dealing with just the visible spectrum down here.
[02:39:22.999 --> 02:39:27.924]  You have all the way from the infrared, the microwaves, and all the way up to x-rays.
[02:39:27.924 --> 02:39:30.086]  So you have a tremendous amount of energy to trap.
[02:39:30.086 --> 02:39:31.807]  But Alex, you're exactly right.
[02:39:31.807 --> 02:39:32.228]  You've got it.
[02:39:32.788 --> 02:39:33.389]  Right on the head.
[02:39:33.389 --> 02:39:35.693]  From above, you can see down the eye.
[02:39:35.693 --> 02:39:37.275]  You put the laser there.
[02:39:37.275 --> 02:39:41.100]  You can drag these things around like a bull with a ring in its nose.
[02:39:41.100 --> 02:39:42.542]  You can increase the energy.
[02:39:42.542 --> 02:39:44.345]  You can decrease the energy.
[02:39:44.345 --> 02:39:48.591]  But the point is, these storms should never have hit any landfall at all.
[02:39:50.073 --> 02:39:54.637]  By the way, certified with old technology, they can control and steer hurricanes.
[02:39:54.637 --> 02:40:02.886]  1967 Stanford Research, Ben Livingston, meteorologist, secret Air Force Navy program, declassified 2006, certified.
[02:40:02.886 --> 02:40:04.868]  They can control them with old technology.
[02:40:04.868 --> 02:40:07.270]  Why aren't they steering them out to sea?
[02:40:07.270 --> 02:40:08.871]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:40:08.871 --> 02:40:13.216]  But I'm wondering also, I think I probably should have got some royalties from this movie.
[02:40:15.303 --> 02:40:17.024]  Well, tell us about the laser technology.
[02:40:17.024 --> 02:40:20.127]  Is that from the Russian research you worked on or others?
[02:40:20.127 --> 02:40:22.008]  Yeah, that's where we developed it.
[02:40:22.008 --> 02:40:25.130]  The Russian scientists were very advanced.
[02:40:25.130 --> 02:40:30.394]  The University of Novosibirsk, Alexey Dmitriev, Alex Tatanov and the crew there.
[02:40:31.154 --> 02:40:40.538]  And I was lucky enough to be associated with them, and the reason they wanted my theoretical work is because they were observing this and they didn't know what was causing it.
[02:40:40.538 --> 02:40:46.321]  So then they understood it, they broke it down, we said, okay, now we can use this because it's like a trigger.
[02:40:47.609 --> 02:40:51.952]  It's like having this energy system and now you can control it.
[02:40:51.952 --> 02:40:53.954]  So you can control tornadoes.
[02:40:53.954 --> 02:40:55.415]  You can move tornadoes around.
[02:40:55.415 --> 02:40:56.736]  Tornadoes are the same.
[02:40:56.736 --> 02:41:01.259]  So they're simply tapping into the incredible amount of energy in space.
[02:41:01.259 --> 02:41:02.039]  Absolutely.
[02:41:02.039 --> 02:41:05.982]  And then pouring it into the earth, directing it where they want with lasers.
[02:41:05.982 --> 02:41:07.303]  Exactly.
[02:41:07.303 --> 02:41:10.425]  You're taking a natural process and enhancing it.
[02:41:10.425 --> 02:41:11.026]  That's what you're doing.
[02:41:12.338 --> 02:41:15.059]  We know that 90% of the space program is secret.
[02:41:15.059 --> 02:41:23.184]  I know you worked on some university programs and things, and most of those are DARPA-funded, so you can't get into that, but how extensive from your research is this?
[02:41:25.445 --> 02:41:28.267]  It's pervasive.
[02:41:28.267 --> 02:41:36.193]  Of course, the military's objective is to control everything, but a long time ago, we decided not to militarize space.
[02:41:36.193 --> 02:41:40.617]  The same Russian scientists in around 2001, once we realized the U.S.
[02:41:40.617 --> 02:41:45.681]  was sending up these laser satellites, they went to the United Nations and wanted a treaty.
[02:41:45.681 --> 02:41:46.201]  The U.N.
[02:41:46.201 --> 02:41:50.364]  wrote up a treaty for space-based, weather-based systems, and the U.S.
[02:41:50.364 --> 02:41:51.425]  refused to sign it.
[02:41:51.425 --> 02:41:52.026]  I remember that!
[02:41:52.901 --> 02:41:55.683]  Yeah, and that was the same group of people.
[02:41:55.683 --> 02:41:59.767]  But then they attack us and say we're crazy, even though I've got all the proposed treaties.
[02:41:59.767 --> 02:42:02.349]  All the stuff you talk about's been in the news now.
[02:42:02.349 --> 02:42:03.830]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:42:03.830 --> 02:42:06.573]  And so the U.S., the reason the U.S.
[02:42:06.573 --> 02:42:14.679]  didn't sign it, because they wouldn't sign a part that would not allow them to use it against their own people.
[02:42:14.679 --> 02:42:15.660]  That's why the U.S.
[02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:17.902]  did not sign it, and that's what they're doing.
[02:42:17.902 --> 02:42:20.824]  They're using this against the American population.
[02:42:21.704 --> 02:42:30.709]  Well, one way they're covering it up in Scientific American and all these tech magazines that we all see at the bookstands, and I've bought many times, is they go, oh, we're going to harness power from space.
[02:42:30.709 --> 02:42:37.633]  They show these big arrays that grab the power, and then it shows a laser that beams it back to a power station on Earth.
[02:42:37.633 --> 02:42:42.596]  But then, I remember reading more and going, wait a minute, they're going to open up a connection through the atmosphere.
[02:42:42.596 --> 02:42:44.397]  Will that bleed off atmosphere?
[02:42:44.397 --> 02:42:50.461]  What will that do to have giant lasers constantly shooting back down to power plants on Earth through the atmosphere?
[02:42:51.178 --> 02:43:02.952]  Well, you can open up a channel to that ionosphere, the laser is going to ionize the air, and just like lightning, it first ionizes a path, and then the energy comes down.
[02:43:02.952 --> 02:43:07.538]  And so, you cannot do this, you cannot have space elevators, you cannot have
[02:43:08.398 --> 02:43:09.699]  Lasers shining through.
[02:43:09.699 --> 02:43:13.742]  The second shuttle accident was a laser beam hitting that.
[02:43:13.742 --> 02:43:14.422]  You could see that.
[02:43:14.422 --> 02:43:19.485]  I saw a video taken by a guy out in California whose hobby it was to take videos.
[02:43:19.485 --> 02:43:23.487]  That even came out in the San Francisco Chronicle and they raided the Gobbyist house.
[02:43:23.487 --> 02:43:26.589]  They videotaped the green laser hitting it and then it vaporizing.
[02:43:26.589 --> 02:43:29.231]  Why do you think they blew up the shuttle?
[02:43:29.231 --> 02:43:30.352]  I don't know.
[02:43:30.352 --> 02:43:34.094]  I have no... If I could get into these people's heads, I...
[02:43:34.727 --> 02:43:37.590]  You know, I'd probably write a book on it, but they're crazy.
[02:43:37.590 --> 02:43:41.513]  Well, they wanted to end the shuttle program, so they just did that to have a bang.
[02:43:41.513 --> 02:43:55.866]  But expanding on this, as we talk more about this, it's just crazy to realize that in pop culture they admit it, in science culture they admit it, but they never give the real reason for it, and now it's just hiding in plain view.
[02:43:55.866 --> 02:43:56.107]  Wow!
[02:43:57.199 --> 02:43:58.379]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:43:58.379 --> 02:43:59.960]  It's in plain view.
[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:08.082]  And when I started talking about this in public, like you say, people thought, this guy's crazy, you know, said laser satellites.
[02:44:08.082 --> 02:44:18.204]  But what's amazing to me, Alex, is they keep pumping this idea on the news, on the news media, on the fake weather news, that hurricanes are caused by warm water.
[02:44:18.780 --> 02:44:20.261]  It's absurd.
[02:44:20.261 --> 02:44:25.184]  There's no mechanism to get energy from warm water into a hurricane, or maintain it.
[02:44:25.184 --> 02:44:28.126]  That's a thermodynamic impossibility.
[02:44:28.126 --> 02:44:30.568]  It's absurd.
[02:44:30.568 --> 02:44:35.651]  But I heard a million times the weathermen keep, though it's went out to sea... I don't understand what you're saying.
[02:44:35.651 --> 02:44:44.097]  This is clearly, tall enough clouds get up into the ionosphere, energy comes in, it starts forming more nuclei, starts spinning, it has more energy then.
[02:44:45.014 --> 02:44:52.980]  Well, the ions that are down around the... as these storm systems move across Africa, the electrical currents are going down to ground.
[02:44:52.980 --> 02:44:56.282]  As soon as they move out over the ocean, there's no ground anymore.
[02:44:56.282 --> 02:45:02.707]  It's just ionized air at the surface of the ocean and those start to spin and try and find a path upwards.
[02:45:02.707 --> 02:45:04.488]  And when they do, that's where the eye forms.
[02:45:04.488 --> 02:45:08.611]  The eye typically forms at the very tallest part of the cumulonimbus clouds.
[02:45:09.191 --> 02:45:11.772]  And that's what's connecting the electrons.
[02:45:11.772 --> 02:45:12.832]  Sure, that's the electrons.
[02:45:12.832 --> 02:45:13.252]  Absolutely.
[02:45:13.252 --> 02:45:15.673]  I've had astrophysicists on, they agree with you.
[02:45:15.673 --> 02:45:17.013]  But again, that's what's crazy.
[02:45:17.013 --> 02:45:23.574]  Mainline science admits all this, but you turn on the news, they're like talking to us like we're five years old.
[02:45:23.574 --> 02:45:24.235]  Yeah.
[02:45:24.235 --> 02:45:27.775]  Why this pretend weathered news?
[02:45:27.775 --> 02:45:32.317]  And, you know, that tornadoes are caused by clouds rubbing together.
[02:45:32.317 --> 02:45:33.357]  What?
[02:45:33.357 --> 02:45:35.717]  You know, this is, it's absurd.
[02:45:35.717 --> 02:45:38.378]  Tornadoes are caused by the same electrical phenomenon.
[02:45:39.102 --> 02:45:48.447]  And we could use that energy, like with Tesla Towers, to extract that energy from the ionosphere, although it really is a pretty dangerous thing to do.
[02:45:48.447 --> 02:46:05.876]  Well, Professor James McKinney, I am so impressed, and there's so much to research and so much to know, but there's just so much happening, and talk about the total class system of this whole secret global scientific and military-industrial elite that Eisenhower warned of, and now this is the new super-elite class
[02:46:06.576 --> 02:46:12.038]  And they've decided they want to depopulate the earth because they're God, like a Moonraker Ian Fleming novel.
[02:46:12.038 --> 02:46:12.958]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:46:12.958 --> 02:46:14.419]  Thank you so much.
[02:46:14.419 --> 02:46:15.239]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:46:15.239 --> 02:46:19.020]  Wow, that was powerful.
[02:46:19.020 --> 02:46:25.023]  If Hillary Clinton's so invincible, why was she worried about little old Alex Jones?
[02:46:25.023 --> 02:46:31.685]  Well, they knew our audience was exposing her, and they knew that we were one of the most viral news sites and radio slash TV shows exposing her.
[02:46:32.554 --> 02:46:43.502]  But they thought what we were saying was radical sounding and that if they made Infowars the poster child for Donald Trump and nationalism, people would turn against it.
[02:46:43.502 --> 02:46:55.711]  But that's in their ivory tower, coastal elites mindset where they hate Christians and hate God and hate Orthodox Jews and just basically hate anybody that isn't a devil worshipper.
[02:46:55.711 --> 02:46:58.153]  And what ended up happening is it blew up in their face.
[02:46:59.619 --> 02:47:00.900]  And they still don't get it, though.
[02:47:00.900 --> 02:47:05.843]  The more they demonize us, the more they attack us, people know they're the enemy.
[02:47:05.843 --> 02:47:07.243]  So here's her earlier comments.
[02:47:07.243 --> 02:47:11.806]  There's been a lot this year where she blamed me for losing the election.
[02:47:11.806 --> 02:47:14.988]  And then, of course, she called me the dark heart during the election.
[02:47:14.988 --> 02:47:19.550]  And all they've done is raise the profile of InfoWars.
[02:47:19.550 --> 02:47:21.091]  But it's a strange thing.
[02:47:21.091 --> 02:47:27.535]  While they raise the profile, they also try to censor our actual articles, our actual videos, and what we've actually said.
[02:47:29.073 --> 02:47:32.594]  So they're trying to destroy the image of Infowars.
[02:47:32.594 --> 02:47:34.495]  So no, we are your champion.
[02:47:34.495 --> 02:47:35.935]  I don't want to be your champion.
[02:47:35.935 --> 02:47:36.935]  I don't have all the answers.
[02:47:36.935 --> 02:47:37.956]  I'm a humble person.
[02:47:37.956 --> 02:47:42.997]  But they've chosen to make us the figurehead of the Liberty Movement.
[02:47:42.997 --> 02:47:48.318]  So understand, if they can destroy us, they're coming after you next.
[02:47:48.318 --> 02:47:50.339]  So I am now you.
[02:47:50.339 --> 02:47:51.399]  You are now me.
[02:47:51.399 --> 02:47:53.340]  We are now together.
[02:47:54.636 --> 02:47:55.637]  We are now one.
[02:47:55.637 --> 02:47:56.778]  They hate you.
[02:47:56.778 --> 02:47:58.299]  They see you as bitter clingers.
[02:47:58.299 --> 02:47:59.520]  Fly over country.
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:00.561]  They want to dominate you.
[02:48:00.561 --> 02:48:02.502]  They want to control you because they know you're good.
[02:48:02.502 --> 02:48:03.423]  It's spiritual.
[02:48:03.423 --> 02:48:10.308]  They have chosen little old me as the person they want to destroy.
[02:48:10.308 --> 02:48:12.730]  So, I'm looking for your prayer more than anything.
[02:48:13.996 --> 02:48:20.981]  Now here is this witch, this woman with child traffickers all around her, funding the Arab Spring, mass murder of Christians, all their crimes.
[02:48:20.981 --> 02:48:28.466]  Here they are, thinking arrogantly, Madam President, Newsweek had already printed up the magazine covers, but it blew up.
[02:48:30.225 --> 02:48:36.947]  In their face because they're not God, they're not invincible, they're just narcissistic megalomaniacs that think they are.
[02:48:36.947 --> 02:48:47.091]  And we called their bluff, we told them filled their hand politically, we've beaten them so far and we'll beat them no matter what happens into the future as long as we never give up.
[02:48:47.091 --> 02:48:48.411]  Here she is.
[02:48:48.411 --> 02:48:52.793]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[02:48:55.583 --> 02:49:01.066]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[02:49:01.066 --> 02:49:09.592]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[02:49:09.592 --> 02:49:21.039]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[02:49:21.039 --> 02:49:22.580]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:39.308]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[02:49:39.308 --> 02:49:42.029]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[02:49:42.029 --> 02:49:48.412]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[02:49:51.112 --> 02:49:53.754]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:49:53.754 --> 02:50:00.140]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:50:00.140 --> 02:50:03.143]  Alright, folks.
[02:50:03.143 --> 02:50:07.907]  Now, the story is up on InfoWars.com.
[02:50:07.907 --> 02:50:12.391]  Hillary Clinton obsessed with Alex Jones in new book.
[02:50:12.391 --> 02:50:15.393]  And we have new attacks.
[02:50:16.607 --> 02:50:19.049]  Here that I'm very, very proud of.
[02:50:19.049 --> 02:50:21.350]  From her book, What Happened?
[02:50:21.350 --> 02:50:25.533]  Well, America rejected you.
[02:50:25.533 --> 02:50:29.495]  You know, it's like taking a drink of milk and you realize it's rotten.
[02:50:29.495 --> 02:50:32.537]  We spit you out of our mouths.
[02:50:32.537 --> 02:50:33.678]  You were beyond lukewarm.
[02:50:33.678 --> 02:50:45.085]  You were like rancid, poisonous, satanic droppings.
[02:50:45.085 --> 02:50:45.745]  You happened.
[02:50:48.081 --> 02:50:52.604]  And nothing can put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[02:50:52.604 --> 02:50:57.686]  So here's a clip from her new book, What Happened?
[02:50:57.686 --> 02:50:59.727]  Attacking Yours Truly.
[02:50:59.727 --> 02:51:01.769]  Here's the first clip.
[02:51:01.769 --> 02:51:07.532]  As hard as the politics of guns are, and as divided as the country feels, we've got to do better.
[02:51:08.697 --> 02:51:11.520]  The NRA can spend all it wants.
[02:51:11.520 --> 02:51:20.207]  Donald Trump can pal around with Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist who has called the Sandy Hook massacre a hoax.
[02:51:20.207 --> 02:51:23.130]  What a despicable lie.
[02:51:23.130 --> 02:51:28.134]  They're on the wrong side of justice, history, basic human decency.
[02:51:29.355 --> 02:51:47.238]  And it's because of the Sandy Hook parents, the mothers of the movement, Gabby and Mark, and so many other incredibly brave survivors and family members that I know in my heart that one day we will stem the tide and save lives.
[02:51:47.238 --> 02:51:49.679]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[02:51:49.679 --> 02:51:57.620]  I have seen them with these talking points pin everything in the campaign and since then that I basically committed the mass shooting at Sandy Hook.
[02:51:58.404 --> 02:52:01.806]  I mean, that's what it's turned into.
[02:52:01.806 --> 02:52:08.369]  My listeners didn't buy the official story because they saw the fake babies in the incubators and the staged stuff to get us in the Iraq War.
[02:52:08.369 --> 02:52:14.952]  And they saw Hillary fund the Arab Spring and they saw all the other things they've done.
[02:52:14.952 --> 02:52:19.974]  So people questioned it because Bloomberg got caught in emails the day before saying a big event's about to happen.
[02:52:19.974 --> 02:52:20.694]  Get ready.
[02:52:20.694 --> 02:52:22.075]  We're going after the guns tomorrow.
[02:52:24.531 --> 02:52:26.792]  But I don't know if Sandy Hook happened or didn't.
[02:52:26.792 --> 02:52:28.754]  In fact, I know mass shootings do happen.
[02:52:28.754 --> 02:52:30.615]  I'm not going to sit there and make a call I can't prove.
[02:52:30.615 --> 02:52:31.835]  Let's say it happened.
[02:52:31.835 --> 02:52:32.936]  Mass shootings happen.
[02:52:32.936 --> 02:52:35.598]  But what I know is they blame gun owners
[02:52:37.128 --> 02:52:47.772]  For Adam Lanza and the illegal gun he had, and then JP Morgan owned the house and bulldozed it the next week, and they bulldozed the school and all this, and then they said gun owners were to blame?
[02:52:47.772 --> 02:52:52.654]  If somebody runs over a crowd of people on Islamicist, Islam's to blame.
[02:52:52.654 --> 02:52:55.515]  Not Ford or Chevy.
[02:52:55.515 --> 02:52:57.315]  Or Dodge or Toyota.
[02:52:57.315 --> 02:53:01.797]  Or Nissan.
[02:53:01.797 --> 02:53:03.878]  Or whatever the company is, Ferrari.
[02:53:05.566 --> 02:53:13.308]  So, I'm sick of hearing some weird, whacked out white supremacist ran over a woman we later learned died of a heart attack or whatever.
[02:53:13.308 --> 02:53:15.308]  Poor lady.
[02:53:15.308 --> 02:53:17.929]  And then all whites are to blame.
[02:53:17.929 --> 02:53:24.090]  But then when you got video all over the world of black people looting, you know, all over Florida, all over the Caribbean.
[02:53:24.090 --> 02:53:25.770]  Oh, don't show that footage of your racism.
[02:53:25.770 --> 02:53:28.771]  I'm not against black people, but I don't blame all black people.
[02:53:28.771 --> 02:53:32.632]  You got a bunch of black people out looting, but don't blame white people when somebody else does something.
[02:53:35.046 --> 02:53:39.629]  So there's that clip, blaming all gun owners, and then misrepresenting what I've said.
[02:53:39.629 --> 02:53:41.210]  It's crazy.
[02:53:41.210 --> 02:53:42.470]  Here's another clip.
[02:53:42.470 --> 02:53:44.772]  What happened?
[02:53:44.772 --> 02:53:48.094]  From her ridiculous book of fiction, from Hillary Clinton.
[02:53:48.094 --> 02:53:49.995]  Here's the next clip.
[02:53:49.995 --> 02:53:57.119]  Then in early December, a 28-year-old man from North Carolina drove to Washington, D.C.
[02:53:57.119 --> 02:54:03.963]  with a Colt AR-15 assault rifle, a .38 caliber Colt revolver, and a knife.
[02:54:05.370 --> 02:54:17.316]  He had read on the internet that a popular local Washington pizzeria was secretly hosting a child sex abuse ring run by John Podesta and me.
[02:54:17.316 --> 02:54:26.961]  This particularly disgusting fake news got its start with an innocuous email released by WikiLeaks about John going out for pizza.
[02:54:26.961 --> 02:54:34.145]  It was quickly refracted through the dark corners of the internet and emerged as a blood-curdling conspiracy theory.
[02:54:35.862 --> 02:54:57.158]  Alex Jones, the right-wing talk show host, effusively praised by Trump, who claims that 9-11 was an inside job and the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax, recorded a YouTube video about, quote, all the children Hillary Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped, unquote.
[02:54:57.158 --> 02:55:01.101]  Soon that young man from North Carolina was in his car on his way to Washington.
[02:55:01.101 --> 02:55:02.843]  I'm not going to listen to more of this.
[02:55:05.245 --> 02:55:15.133]  That clip is directly what they played on Fox News with Megyn Kelly, where I said, I don't know if the pizzeria stuff's true.
[02:55:15.133 --> 02:55:23.199]  And that was the media diverting onto the pizza place when it was pizza code words in the Podesta emails in New York about we're going to have the cheese pizza, we're going to have the kids and the hot tubs.
[02:55:23.199 --> 02:55:29.925]  It was CNN, New York Times and others that diverted off into the pizzeria and then said we made those claims about the pizzeria.
[02:55:29.925 --> 02:55:31.526]  You understand?
[02:55:31.526 --> 02:55:33.488]  And then we clarified and they called it a retraction.
[02:55:34.633 --> 02:55:37.894]  So that's their fake news disinfo op.
[02:55:37.894 --> 02:55:42.595]  But no, people all around you are being convicted of sex crimes like Weiner.
[02:55:42.595 --> 02:55:50.078]  Your husband's in dozens and dozens of flights on the sex plane, Lolita Express with kidnapped little girls, Jerry Epstein.
[02:55:50.078 --> 02:55:57.000]  Your top people in your foundation get caught shipping little kids out of Haiti for sale and then change their names and cover it up.
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:02.561]  The first people you represented in legal firms were child rapists, Hillary.
[02:56:02.561 --> 02:56:04.182]  So you built this straw man
[02:56:06.158 --> 02:56:12.121]  That we sat there and made all this up and sat there and did all of this.
[02:56:12.121 --> 02:56:17.483]  And then some guy that's an actor shows up, none of the witnesses say they saw a gun fired or even heard it.
[02:56:17.483 --> 02:56:26.768]  Then you say he came because of me and shot into the wall so that now all pedophiles, now any investigation of the Catholic Church, any of it, it doesn't exist.
[02:56:30.191 --> 02:56:36.956]  Even though Senator Menendez is in court right now, you're not going to be able to run on forever, lady.
[02:56:36.956 --> 02:56:49.066]  The truth is your publications, said the pizzeria, your publications diverted everyone onto that instead of all the real emails to cover what really happened and what really unfolded and you failed again.
[02:56:49.066 --> 02:56:54.090]  Oh, the good news is her book is 50% off out of the gate.
[02:56:54.090 --> 02:56:56.351]  She's a total failure.
[02:56:56.351 --> 02:56:57.853]  No one's buying her lies.
[02:56:58.863 --> 02:57:02.728]  It's already literally 50% off out of the gates.
[02:57:02.728 --> 02:57:04.170]  And that's in England.
[02:57:04.170 --> 02:57:08.575]  Here's another clip from Hillary from her stupid book.
[02:57:08.575 --> 02:57:12.280]  The simplest part is traditional state-run media.
[02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:16.105]  In this case, Russian networks such as RT and Sputnik.
[02:57:17.116 --> 02:57:30.401]  They use their global reach to push Kremlin talking points over the airwaves and social media, including malicious headlines like Clinton and ISIS funded by same money.
[02:57:30.401 --> 02:57:34.843]  Sputnik frequently used the same Twitter hashtag as Trump.
[02:57:34.843 --> 02:57:36.144]  Hashtag Crooked Hillary.
[02:57:37.426 --> 02:57:41.228]  It's hard to know exactly how wide of a reach RT has.
[02:57:41.228 --> 02:57:42.028]  Hit pause.
[02:57:42.028 --> 02:57:43.189]  Hit pause.
[02:57:43.189 --> 02:57:45.930]  Anytime a hashtag... See, she thinks you're so dumb.
[02:57:45.930 --> 02:57:47.311]  Her readers are so dumb.
[02:57:47.311 --> 02:57:58.136]  When there's a top hashtag for Super Bowl or Crooked Hillary, whatever's up in the top ten, everyone hashtags that so that it's in the reference feed of whatever's hot.
[02:58:00.441 --> 02:58:12.872]  But because a Russian newspaper was doing stories about Hillary and piling on to the huge campaign and the traffic, that's the proof that they use the same hashtag.
[02:58:12.872 --> 02:58:17.797]  That's like if you've got a pizza place and you put in the phone book, pizza.
[02:58:17.797 --> 02:58:19.899]  Like, strange, another pizza place said the name pizza.
[02:58:21.363 --> 02:58:22.824]  See how dumb she thinks you are?
[02:58:22.824 --> 02:58:36.134]  We're gonna come back with her latest attacks out of the book on yours truly because she's desperate and pathetic and we just passed the one-year anniversary of her collapse onto her evil fat face on the 9-11 memorial.
[02:58:36.134 --> 02:58:37.035]  Visit GCNlive.com.
[02:58:37.035 --> 02:58:39.037]  Because there is a God.
[02:58:39.037 --> 02:58:40.738]  Fourth Hour, Paul Watson coming up.
[02:58:43.204 --> 02:58:49.731]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[02:58:49.731 --> 02:59:02.363]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:59:02.703 --> 02:59:06.365]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:59:06.365 --> 02:59:13.329]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:59:13.329 --> 02:59:26.217]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:59:26.217 --> 02:59:27.758]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:59:28.038 --> 02:59:34.444]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[02:59:34.444 --> 02:59:39.368]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:59:39.368 --> 02:59:40.909]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:52.003 --> 02:59:57.127]  We're getting a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own.
[02:59:57.127 --> 03:00:13.459]  I've also directed Secretary Johnson and Attorney General Holder to identify additional actions my administration can take on our own, within my existing legal authorities, to do what Congress refuses to do and fix as much of our immigration system as we can.
[03:00:13.459 --> 03:00:18.042]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:27.150 --> 03:00:28.432]  We got breaking news.
[03:00:28.432 --> 03:00:30.214]  I hate to cut into Paul Watson's time.
[03:00:30.214 --> 03:00:34.979]  It's hard to get him to come host the show because he's so busy writing hit articles and being in the top 50 on Twitter.
[03:00:35.962 --> 03:00:39.305]  But Laura Loomer confronted Hillary about what happened.
[03:00:39.305 --> 03:00:45.111]  So she's coming in at the start of the next segment and we're going to get her on and show that video that I'm told just went on her Twitter.
[03:00:45.111 --> 03:00:46.773]  Mike Cernovich was just tweeting me.
[03:00:46.773 --> 03:00:51.297]  She was going to be on earlier but it got delayed so we're going to have her on tomorrow but the confrontation happened.
[03:00:51.297 --> 03:00:54.000]  Now listen to this next clip out of what happened.
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:55.861]  How Hillary collapsed in her fake book.
[03:00:56.562 --> 03:01:02.664]  That now it's 50% off everywhere, 40% off on Amazon, and it's already 30% off on Amazon, so that's 70% off.
[03:01:02.664 --> 03:01:04.545]  So it's already discounted.
[03:01:04.545 --> 03:01:05.365]  What happened?
[03:01:05.365 --> 03:01:07.126]  No one buys your lies anymore.
[03:01:07.126 --> 03:01:08.946]  Go away!
[03:01:08.946 --> 03:01:11.287]  Don't go away mad, just go away, lady!
[03:01:13.652 --> 03:01:27.181]  She acts like though, oh, RT's not powerful, but once they tell Alex what to do, and once they tell Breitbart and Drudge what to do, as if Americans aren't smart and hardworking and don't see her as a crooked swamp dweller.
[03:01:27.181 --> 03:01:39.110]  Just because you and other idiots like Maxine Waters say the swamp came from Putin, or crooked Hillary came from Putin, or, no, it came from us, dumbass!
[03:01:40.222 --> 03:01:41.823]  I don't get stuff from the Russians.
[03:01:41.823 --> 03:01:43.784]  I hardly read Russian news.
[03:01:43.784 --> 03:01:45.085]  Nothing against the Russians.
[03:01:45.085 --> 03:01:50.288]  I don't need the Russians to put my pants on in the morning.
[03:01:50.288 --> 03:01:58.572]  She talks about us like we're a bunch of idiots because that's what she thinks you are because her constituents are that!
[03:01:58.572 --> 03:01:59.653]  Gosh, I'm sick of these people.
[03:01:59.653 --> 03:02:00.313]  Let's play the clip.
[03:02:00.313 --> 03:02:02.054]  Here it is.
[03:02:02.054 --> 03:02:05.076]  Part is traditional state-run media.
[03:02:05.076 --> 03:02:08.878]  In this case, Russian networks such as RT and Sputnik.
[03:02:10.515 --> 03:02:13.377]  I write the talking points!
[03:02:13.377 --> 03:02:16.439]  I wrote most of them!
[03:02:16.439 --> 03:02:17.480]  I don't want to brag!
[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:19.041]  But I wrote them!
[03:02:19.041 --> 03:02:19.622]  I wrote them!
[03:02:19.622 --> 03:02:19.842]  I did!
[03:02:19.842 --> 03:02:19.962]  Me!
[03:02:19.962 --> 03:02:20.222]  This guy!
[03:02:40.532 --> 03:02:48.246]  It's probably more than you'd think, maybe hundreds of thousands, but not enough that it would have a big impact on an election by itself.
[03:02:48.246 --> 03:02:48.807]  Hit pause again.
[03:02:49.949 --> 03:02:52.151]  I happen to know RT stats.
[03:02:52.151 --> 03:02:53.632]  They now have double CNN's.
[03:02:53.632 --> 03:02:55.353]  This has been in global news.
[03:02:55.353 --> 03:02:58.476]  Double CNN's viewership worldwide because everybody hates CNN.
[03:02:58.476 --> 03:03:01.238]  RT is on broadcast stations in the UK and Europe.
[03:03:01.238 --> 03:03:05.962]  It's tens of millions of viewers per hour globally.
[03:03:05.962 --> 03:03:07.924]  But they've been blocked in the US.
[03:03:07.924 --> 03:03:09.125]  RT Global's big.
[03:03:09.125 --> 03:03:10.726]  RT America tiny.
[03:03:10.726 --> 03:03:11.687]  Yes.
[03:03:11.687 --> 03:03:13.108]  Maybe a hundred thousand.
[03:03:13.108 --> 03:03:14.749]  Way below CNN.
[03:03:14.749 --> 03:03:16.691]  RT America is not successful.
[03:03:16.691 --> 03:03:17.572]  RT Global's huge.
[03:03:18.615 --> 03:03:20.576]  Because CNN created a vacuum.
[03:03:20.576 --> 03:03:24.037]  So she's acting like they didn't, everything she says is a lie.
[03:03:24.037 --> 03:03:25.718]  Let's continue.
[03:03:25.718 --> 03:03:27.559]  By itself.
[03:03:27.559 --> 03:03:43.585]  But when RT propaganda gets picked up and repeated by American media outlets, such as Fox News, Breitbart, and Alex Jones's Infowars, and posted on Facebook, its reach expands dramatically.
[03:03:44.918 --> 03:03:47.962]  That happened frequently during the campaign.
[03:03:47.962 --> 03:03:55.593]  Trump and his team also helped amplify Russian stories, giving them an even bigger megaphone.
[03:03:55.593 --> 03:04:00.740]  Really, show us the proof of the amplification of Russian stories.
[03:04:02.762 --> 03:04:18.931]  You guys at Alistair Crowley events, with the leader admitting she's a devil worshipper, and photos of little kids at the events, and Jerry Epstein, and Weiner, and all you creepozoids, and Bill Clinton running around, and Al Gore, you did this to yourself!
[03:04:18.931 --> 03:04:21.772]  You did these things!
[03:04:21.772 --> 03:04:31.998]  Not your mythical Russian unicorns, and Lucky Charms, leprechauns, that just gave me a pot of gold!
[03:04:34.236 --> 03:04:37.217]  Our will to crush you beat you.
[03:04:37.217 --> 03:04:39.838]  Don't try to steal our accomplishments away.
[03:04:39.838 --> 03:04:44.240]  The American people kicked your evil ass out.
[03:04:44.240 --> 03:04:45.401]  Witch!
[03:04:45.401 --> 03:04:46.321]  You understand that?
[03:04:46.321 --> 03:04:49.602]  Laura Loomer coming up.
[03:04:49.602 --> 03:04:56.886]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[03:04:56.886 --> 03:04:58.026]  You're a white male!
[03:05:03.130 --> 03:05:08.873]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in InfoWars live broadcasting.
[03:05:08.873 --> 03:05:11.434]  We are live weekdays from 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:05:11.434 --> 03:05:17.798]  Central at InfoWars.com slash show and this YouTube channel right here that you've landed on.
[03:05:17.798 --> 03:05:20.919]  Please subscribe to the channel for updates and notifications.
[03:05:20.919 --> 03:05:23.801]  You can follow us on Twitter at War Room Show.
[03:05:24.241 --> 03:05:27.385]  We are going to have the most powerful guests, the most powerful hosts.
[03:05:27.385 --> 03:05:32.551]  We'll be hearing from Alex Jones regularly, as well as taking your phone calls.
[03:05:32.551 --> 03:05:36.155]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[03:05:36.155 --> 03:05:39.078]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[03:05:39.078 --> 03:05:40.320]  This is The War Room.
[03:05:50.154 --> 03:06:00.758]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:06:00.758 --> 03:06:02.818]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:06:02.818 --> 03:06:05.679]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:06:05.679 --> 03:06:07.180]  It's made in the USA.
[03:06:07.180 --> 03:06:10.301]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[03:06:10.541 --> 03:06:14.004]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:06:14.004 --> 03:06:16.086]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:06:16.086 --> 03:06:25.794]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:06:25.794 --> 03:06:38.125]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[03:06:38.285 --> 03:06:42.610]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:06:42.610 --> 03:06:45.894]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:06:45.894 --> 03:06:47.495]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[03:06:47.495 --> 03:06:48.316]  With Z-Shield.
[03:06:48.316 --> 03:06:49.498]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:06:50.782 --> 03:06:56.024]  Protect your skin with SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion by Emrix Essentials.
[03:06:56.024 --> 03:07:03.186]  Perfect for face and body, this natural unscented sunscreen can be worn at all times of the day, whenever you need sun protection.
[03:07:03.186 --> 03:07:09.068]  We source ingredients from nature, producing a product free of harmful chemicals and toxins.
[03:07:09.068 --> 03:07:16.850]  This natural lotion contains 21% zinc oxide, which is the largest particle size used, and we do not use nanoparticles.
[03:07:17.390 --> 03:07:20.914]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.
[03:07:20.914 --> 03:07:25.058]  The organic oils help hydrate the skin, leaving it nice and smooth.
[03:07:25.058 --> 03:07:29.482]  The truly natural fragrance-free sunscreen for the most sensitive skin.
[03:07:29.482 --> 03:07:35.709]  Emrix Essentials wants you to enjoy the scent and strives to bring you organic products to enhance your life.
[03:07:35.709 --> 03:07:40.594]  Naturally protect your skin with SPF 30 sunscreen lotion by Emrix Essentials.
[03:07:40.834 --> 03:07:44.136]  Stop exposing yourself and your family to toxic ingredients.
[03:07:44.136 --> 03:07:49.399]  Visit InfoWarsStore.com and learn more about the new SPF30 sunscreen lotion.
[03:08:07.819 --> 03:08:09.520]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:08:09.520 --> 03:08:11.162]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:11.162 --> 03:08:18.127]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:18.127 --> 03:08:35.460]  So there I was, on the platform, you know, feeling like an out-of-body experience, and then his speech, which was a cry from the white nationalist gut.
[03:08:35.460 --> 03:08:37.162]  We, the citizens of America,
[03:08:37.990 --> 03:08:49.380]  We are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.
[03:08:49.380 --> 03:08:54.625]  What an opportunity to say, okay, I'm proud of my supporters, but I'm the president of all Americans.
[03:08:54.625 --> 03:08:56.427]  That's not what we heard at all.
[03:08:56.427 --> 03:09:02.052]  The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.
[03:09:04.909 --> 03:09:06.670]  That was devastating.
[03:09:06.670 --> 03:09:08.432]  I didn't think I would lose.
[03:09:08.432 --> 03:09:15.797]  The two best politicians I know, my husband and Barack Obama, did not think I would lose.
[03:09:15.797 --> 03:09:18.899]  This is the heart of 1776.
[03:09:18.899 --> 03:09:20.140]  You're a white male!
[03:09:20.140 --> 03:09:25.404]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[03:09:25.404 --> 03:09:26.645]  Move, bitch!
[03:09:26.645 --> 03:09:29.487]  Get out the way!
[03:09:29.487 --> 03:09:33.490]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag
[03:09:33.970 --> 03:09:35.951]  This man is the American plan!
[03:09:35.951 --> 03:09:39.914]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[03:09:39.914 --> 03:09:43.436]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[03:09:43.436 --> 03:09:45.077]  I will not let you down.
[03:09:45.077 --> 03:09:47.639]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:09:47.639 --> 03:09:49.179]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[03:09:49.179 --> 03:09:51.901]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[03:09:51.901 --> 03:09:57.585]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[03:09:57.585 --> 03:10:00.146]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:10:00.146 --> 03:10:01.147]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:10:03.248 --> 03:10:06.311]  And Paul Watson is going to be hosting much of this hour.
[03:10:06.311 --> 03:10:09.594]  We're going to skip two of the breaks so he gets his time back.
[03:10:09.594 --> 03:10:13.297]  Laura Loomer was going to be on 30 minutes ago, but the book signing went late.
[03:10:13.297 --> 03:10:16.280]  She was able to confront, I'm told, Hillary.
[03:10:16.280 --> 03:10:17.842]  And we're dragging the clips in right now.
[03:10:17.842 --> 03:10:20.264]  This just happened 30 minutes ago live.
[03:10:20.264 --> 03:10:27.971]  Hillary Ann Uba Abedin bombshell article already written by Paul Watson on Infowars.com.
[03:10:27.971 --> 03:10:28.551]  What a crew!
[03:10:29.272 --> 03:10:30.753]  Paul's about to go live with us.
[03:10:30.753 --> 03:10:32.534]  He hammers out this article.
[03:10:32.534 --> 03:10:38.657]  I want to thank Laura Loomer for letting us know that she was planning this yesterday and successfully executing it.
[03:10:38.657 --> 03:10:40.097]  What a patriot.
[03:10:40.097 --> 03:10:41.858]  We need to hire her to be a reporter.
[03:10:41.858 --> 03:10:44.219]  And then we've got Mike Cernovich updating us.
[03:10:44.219 --> 03:10:46.280]  At Cernovich on Twitter.
[03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:47.941]  At Prison Planet's Paul Watson.
[03:10:47.941 --> 03:10:49.562]  I'm at Real Alex Jones.
[03:10:49.562 --> 03:10:51.263]  Critical now more than ever.
[03:10:52.210 --> 03:10:55.633]  Everybody share our links, share our tweets, share our articles.
[03:10:55.633 --> 03:10:57.135]  Hillary confronted during book signing.
[03:10:57.135 --> 03:10:58.756]  What happened to Seth Rich?
[03:10:58.756 --> 03:11:02.280]  What happened to the 33,000 emails?
[03:11:02.280 --> 03:11:08.225]  And Uma Abedin, why didn't you divorce your husband for sexting an underage girl that looks like Ted Cruz?
[03:11:08.225 --> 03:11:11.608]  I mean, this is all incredible.
[03:11:11.608 --> 03:11:13.230]  We're going to go to Laura Limmer in a moment.
[03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:20.316]  What a hero, this lady is, the stuff she's done, so many other ex-boys, we won't get into them now.
[03:11:20.316 --> 03:11:25.780]  Paul Watson, this is exciting to see this type of information warfare.
[03:11:25.780 --> 03:11:29.743]  Well, it's almost like we knew about it in advance, Alex, isn't it?
[03:11:29.743 --> 03:11:36.629]  But the thing about this, and Laura will get into it with you even more, Hillary basically turned up an hour and a half late.
[03:11:36.629 --> 03:11:38.971]  She was schmoozing with people at The View.
[03:11:38.971 --> 03:11:41.233]  You literally had disabled people, the elderly,
[03:11:41.833 --> 03:11:44.295]  Melting outside in the boiling hot sun.
[03:11:44.295 --> 03:11:45.835]  There were ambulances called.
[03:11:45.835 --> 03:11:54.240]  People were collapsing of heat exhaustion and dehydration because Queen Hillary wouldn't even show up on time to see her own supporters.
[03:11:54.240 --> 03:12:01.003]  There were tons of people who didn't even get in because they didn't turn up early enough to get the bracelets to meet the goddess.
[03:12:01.003 --> 03:12:06.667]  So that's the amount of spite and disregard she has for her own supporters.
[03:12:06.667 --> 03:12:09.228]  Again, underscoring how completely arrogant she is.
[03:12:11.448 --> 03:12:14.950]  Now, there's several videos, several confrontations, and we're going to lower limit.
[03:12:14.950 --> 03:12:16.291]  We're pulling them in right now.
[03:12:16.291 --> 03:12:19.934]  They're on NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com.
[03:12:19.934 --> 03:12:23.896]  They've been tweeted at Cernovich, at PrisonPlanet.
[03:12:23.896 --> 03:12:24.837]  That's you, Paul.
[03:12:24.837 --> 03:12:26.158]  People need to get this out.
[03:12:26.158 --> 03:12:29.260]  Chain reaction, just like Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[03:12:29.260 --> 03:12:31.461]  We need to go out and tell her what happened.
[03:12:31.461 --> 03:12:32.722]  A, tell her what happened.
[03:12:32.722 --> 03:12:33.323]  You're a traitor.
[03:12:33.323 --> 03:12:34.263]  You're a globalist.
[03:12:34.263 --> 03:12:35.424]  We rejected you.
[03:12:35.424 --> 03:12:36.465]  America happened.
[03:12:36.465 --> 03:12:39.807]  But also, you know, ask her, what happened with Benghazi?
[03:12:39.807 --> 03:12:40.888]  What happened with the emails?
[03:12:42.964 --> 03:12:47.127]  Well, that's exactly what Laura asked her, Alex, and she can tell you about that herself.
[03:12:47.127 --> 03:12:56.494]  But also, as you see in the video, as she was being basically dragged out by Secret Service, she also cut her foot reportedly, and she's going to talk about that as well.
[03:12:56.494 --> 03:13:03.179]  She got to confront Huma Abedin and asked her, quote, when are you going to divorce your husband for texting underage girls?
[03:13:03.919 --> 03:13:14.905]  Yuma wasn't happy with that question and at that point they really started getting aggressive with her and she was out of the building, but it was a really good confrontation again, underscoring that this is how you do this kind of thing.
[03:13:14.905 --> 03:13:23.529]  I mean, she'll tell you, she literally had to wait about seven or eight hours with no water, standing up the whole time just to get this confrontation.
[03:13:23.529 --> 03:13:29.812]  And the media always spins this that these people are paid, and every time they do it to make fake news real, the alchemy,
[03:13:30.592 --> 03:13:34.653]  Laura Loomer's not paid to do this by us, but I'm sending her this video so powerful.
[03:13:34.653 --> 03:13:42.915]  $5,000 for doing this and getting beat up and standing there for all these hours.
[03:13:42.915 --> 03:13:43.675]  $5,000 from the war chest.
[03:13:43.675 --> 03:13:51.037]  We're not rich here, but the money we get is spent on real journalism, on taking action, and I want to get Laura Loomer officially doing work with us.
[03:13:51.037 --> 03:13:53.658]  I know she does with some other outfits, but very, very exciting.
[03:13:53.658 --> 03:13:57.259]  Laura Loomer, let's bring you up before we play this powerful video.
[03:13:57.779 --> 03:14:00.801]  Again, Laura Loomer, Laura Loomer, at Laura Loomer on Twitter.
[03:14:00.801 --> 03:14:02.681]  Go ahead.
[03:14:02.681 --> 03:14:04.062]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me.
[03:14:04.062 --> 03:14:05.103]  How are you?
[03:14:05.103 --> 03:14:05.923]  Fantastic.
[03:14:05.923 --> 03:14:06.863]  So tell us what happened.
[03:14:06.863 --> 03:14:07.564]  Describe it for us.
[03:14:08.667 --> 03:14:10.027]  Oh my god, it was brutal.
[03:14:10.027 --> 03:14:16.468]  So I literally have been waiting outside in 100 degree weather, without water, without food, for 7 hours.
[03:14:16.468 --> 03:14:22.189]  I woke up at 5 o'clock in the morning to be there at 7.30 and it was just insane.
[03:14:22.189 --> 03:14:27.130]  Hillary decided to show up an hour late because she wanted to go on The View and kept everyone waiting.
[03:14:27.130 --> 03:14:30.871]  People were passing out from heat exhaustion.
[03:14:30.871 --> 03:14:37.512]  There were people with prosthetic legs who were forced to stand for hours because they couldn't bring disabled people inside to sit down.
[03:14:38.072 --> 03:14:44.968]  And it was honestly the longest I've ever waited to confront a politician in my life, and I've confronted a lot of people.
[03:14:46.676 --> 03:14:50.018]  You know, I'm there and I'm recording and they say, put your phones away.
[03:14:50.018 --> 03:14:53.180]  But, you know, I'm trained to kind of secretly record.
[03:14:53.180 --> 03:14:56.682]  I learned a lot about that with my time at Project Veritas.
[03:14:56.682 --> 03:15:00.785]  And as I'm walking up, I see Huma in the background.
[03:15:00.785 --> 03:15:08.490]  And, you know, I get Hillary at first and I said, Hillary, the American people would really like to know what happened to your 33,000 emails.
[03:15:08.490 --> 03:15:11.532]  And then she kind of giggled and said, well, you're going to have to read the book.
[03:15:11.532 --> 03:15:13.013]  And I said, well, what happened in Benghazi?
[03:15:13.593 --> 03:15:18.836]  And what happened to the millions of dollars you were supposed to give to, you know, all those poor people in Haiti?
[03:15:18.836 --> 03:15:24.239]  And then she, you know, I don't really remember exactly what she said, because it was, you know, in the heat of the moment.
[03:15:24.239 --> 03:15:25.920]  And then I said, what happened to Seth Rich?
[03:15:25.920 --> 03:15:30.703]  And she said, you know, you really shouldn't believe everything you hear on, like, fake news.
[03:15:30.703 --> 03:15:39.408]  And at that point, you know, they had recognized me because the same book handlers were there from when I confronted Chelsea Clinton at the same Barnes & Noble a couple of months ago.
[03:15:39.408 --> 03:15:42.150]  So you would think that these people would be smart enough to recognize me.
[03:15:42.290 --> 03:15:43.011]  And I have the answer here.
[03:15:43.011 --> 03:15:46.133]  Everybody keeps saying, do we sue the tech giants for censoring us?
[03:15:46.133 --> 03:15:46.253]  Yes.
[03:15:46.253 --> 03:15:47.714]  Do we form our own companies?
[03:15:47.714 --> 03:15:47.794]  Yes.
[03:15:47.794 --> 03:15:48.615]  Do we boycott them?
[03:15:48.615 --> 03:15:48.815]  Yes.
[03:15:48.815 --> 03:15:50.356]  Do we have whistleblowers inside?
[03:15:50.356 --> 03:15:50.456]  Yes.
[03:16:08.610 --> 03:16:17.313]  We physically go peacefully everywhere the tech people are, the globalists, the Republican rhinos, the globalists, the radical jihadis.
[03:16:17.313 --> 03:16:21.775]  We go everywhere and confront them with the truth and put it out.
[03:16:21.775 --> 03:16:25.737]  And what you did is going super viral, Laura Loomer.
[03:16:25.737 --> 03:16:28.258]  We just want to commend you and salute you.
[03:16:28.258 --> 03:16:29.598]  Barnes & Noble.
[03:16:29.598 --> 03:16:31.959]  Tell us, this was Barnes & Noble in New York City.
[03:16:31.959 --> 03:16:33.680]  I gotta tell you, I've been to many 9-11 memorials.
[03:16:34.500 --> 03:16:35.820]  This is a Barnes and Noble in New York City.
[03:16:35.820 --> 03:16:40.861]  And let me just tell you this, a lot of people, I got detained by Secret Service and they tried to humiliate me, right?
[03:16:40.861 --> 03:16:43.262]  They took me out of the building and they said, what do you do?
[03:16:43.262 --> 03:16:44.362]  And I said, I'm a journalist.
[03:16:44.362 --> 03:16:46.502]  And then they were like, you're a journalist?
[03:16:46.502 --> 03:16:49.823]  And they took my phone and they were trying to delete the video, but I wouldn't.
[03:16:49.823 --> 03:16:53.024]  And the most interesting thing is they said, are you trying to hurt Hillary Clinton?
[03:16:53.024 --> 03:16:56.224]  Because they were there because of what Martin Shkreli had said.
[03:16:56.224 --> 03:16:58.845]  They said, we're here to protect Mrs. Clinton because
[03:16:58.945 --> 03:17:01.366]  Somebody threatened to cut a piece of her hair off for $5,000.
[03:17:01.366 --> 03:17:05.629]  And they were asking me if I was there to, like, you know, cut her hair.
[03:17:05.629 --> 03:17:09.831]  Sure, they were dehumanizing you, even though they know full well you're a peaceful activist.
[03:17:09.831 --> 03:17:12.412]  They're the ones that love to say, kill the police all day.
[03:17:12.412 --> 03:17:18.035]  They have special libtard secret service that, you know, the Clintons only have the very worst around them.
[03:17:18.035 --> 03:17:22.277]  But good secret service told us about how she was having convulsions every 45 minutes.
[03:17:22.277 --> 03:17:27.120]  We put the word out, caught her in the medical tent last year, and one week later she fell down, didn't she?
[03:17:28.578 --> 03:17:29.939]  Yeah, and you know what's crazy?
[03:17:29.939 --> 03:17:32.120]  As I asked Hillary, I was like, what happened to your health?
[03:17:32.120 --> 03:17:40.385]  And then as I'm getting detained by Secret Service, I said, you know, I read that book by the Secret Service officer who was talking about how she doesn't treat you guys very well.
[03:17:40.385 --> 03:17:48.469]  And I just want to say, even though you're detaining me, I respect what you do, and you have a very hard job, and I'm not resisting, and I'm going to totally comply with what you're asking me.
[03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:50.671]  Just know that this is my First Amendment right to ask
[03:17:51.691 --> 03:17:54.514]  Sure, they're bullies and you've got to call them on that.
[03:18:19.494 --> 03:18:20.536]  I want to go to this video.
[03:18:20.536 --> 03:18:25.003]  I'm going to turn things over to Paul because I don't want to hog into the hour he's gracious enough to do here with us.
[03:18:25.003 --> 03:18:25.884]  Paul of Prison Planet.
[03:18:26.741 --> 03:18:30.142]  But let's go ahead and play this clip here in a moment.
[03:18:30.142 --> 03:18:32.363]  But first off, I heard you did get roughed up.
[03:18:32.363 --> 03:18:33.523]  Did you cut your foot?
[03:18:33.523 --> 03:18:35.084]  Because like you said, this just happened.
[03:18:35.084 --> 03:18:37.644]  You haven't even seen this video yet that you uploaded.
[03:18:37.644 --> 03:18:38.405]  I haven't seen it.
[03:18:38.405 --> 03:18:39.925]  And I'm sorry I sound so out of breath.
[03:18:39.925 --> 03:18:43.946]  I literally have not had anything to drink in like 10 hours and I'm very dehydrated.
[03:18:43.946 --> 03:18:44.607]  I'm shaking.
[03:18:44.607 --> 03:18:51.849]  And yeah, I think that when they dragged me out, I must have like cut my foot on some glass because it feels like I have glass splinters in the bottom of my
[03:18:52.089 --> 03:18:54.652]  Sure, just to be clear, I've been at many 9-11 memorials.
[03:18:54.652 --> 03:18:56.413]  You think Texas is hot?
[03:18:56.413 --> 03:19:03.820]  In September, New York is like 100 degrees and super, super wet.
[03:19:03.820 --> 03:19:04.801]  I mean, the humidity is like 90%.
[03:19:06.693 --> 03:19:11.895]  Oh yeah, and I'm from Arizona, Alex, so I know what hot is, and I'm telling you, like, the humidity is way worse than the dry heat.
[03:19:11.895 --> 03:19:13.256]  So, it's been really hot.
[03:19:13.256 --> 03:19:18.118]  Oh, I've been in Arizona when it's 115, it kind of feels cool, it's like, it's like real crisp, but hot.
[03:19:18.118 --> 03:19:20.739]  But when you're in New York, or Houston, it's just as bad.
[03:19:20.739 --> 03:19:24.520]  Houston and New York, man, when it's humid, it's horrible.
[03:19:24.520 --> 03:19:29.442]  Let's go ahead and play this clip, and I'm going to turn you and Paul over to the show here.
[03:19:29.442 --> 03:19:33.184]  But here is Laura Loomer confronting Huma Abedin and Hillary Clinton just 30-40 minutes ago.
[03:19:35.523 --> 03:19:37.105]  Hi, it's so great to see you.
[03:19:37.105 --> 03:19:39.048]  Well, it's great for you to be here.
[03:19:39.048 --> 03:19:40.029]  Thanks for having me.
[03:19:53.729 --> 03:19:54.650]  Thank you for coming.
[03:19:54.650 --> 03:19:55.470]  Thanks for having me.
[03:19:55.470 --> 03:20:00.434]  So the American people would really like to know, what happened to your 33,000 emails?
[03:20:00.434 --> 03:20:02.276]  What happened to Benghazi?
[03:20:02.276 --> 03:20:03.237]  Go read the book.
[03:20:03.237 --> 03:20:07.140]  What happened to the millions of dollars that was supposed to go to the people in Haiti?
[03:20:07.140 --> 03:20:07.940]  You know what?
[03:20:07.940 --> 03:20:08.741]  I'm so sorry.
[03:20:08.741 --> 03:20:10.322]  You believe things that are untrue.
[03:20:10.322 --> 03:20:10.843]  Read the book.
[03:20:10.843 --> 03:20:11.923]  What happened to Seth Rich?
[03:20:11.923 --> 03:20:13.705]  What happened to your health, Hillary?
[03:20:18.789 --> 03:20:19.389]  She's focused.
[03:20:19.389 --> 03:20:20.210]  She's professional.
[03:20:20.210 --> 03:20:21.230]  She's on target.
[03:20:21.230 --> 03:20:22.351]  She gets the questions in.
[03:20:22.351 --> 03:20:23.372]  She's not threatening.
[03:20:23.372 --> 03:20:24.612]  They begin manhandling her.
[03:20:24.612 --> 03:20:26.473]  If you're a radio listener, I'm describing the video.
[03:20:26.473 --> 03:20:27.294]  Dragging her away.
[03:20:27.294 --> 03:20:27.814]  Let's continue.
[03:20:48.835 --> 03:20:50.376]  Puma, it's so great to see you.
[03:20:50.376 --> 03:20:51.696]  I have a question for you.
[03:20:51.696 --> 03:20:54.178]  When are you going to divorce your husband for texting on your phone?
[03:20:54.178 --> 03:20:55.358]  We're going to step out of here.
[03:20:55.358 --> 03:20:56.679]  We're going to step out of here.
[03:20:56.679 --> 03:20:57.399]  I don't need a book.
[03:20:57.399 --> 03:20:57.859]  I paid for a book.
[03:20:57.859 --> 03:20:59.220]  We're just going to step out of here.
[03:20:59.220 --> 03:20:59.760]  Thank you, ma'am.
[03:20:59.760 --> 03:21:00.781]  We're just going to step out of here.
[03:21:02.045 --> 03:21:05.347]  Wow, I see Paul Watson over there laughing.
[03:21:05.347 --> 03:21:06.528]  This is just amazing.
[03:21:06.528 --> 03:21:08.089]  And this is the stuff that scares them.
[03:21:08.089 --> 03:21:11.171]  Because even in New York, they can barely get a crowd of a couple hundred people.
[03:21:11.171 --> 03:21:13.232]  I mean, you can get a crowd anywhere in the world.
[03:21:13.232 --> 03:21:13.573]  I can't.
[03:21:13.573 --> 03:21:14.073]  Laura can't.
[03:21:14.073 --> 03:21:14.994]  Bigger than that.
[03:21:14.994 --> 03:21:16.755]  She's got all this Secret Service, all this.
[03:21:16.755 --> 03:21:21.838]  There's Aberdeen creeping around with her pervert husband, convicted pervert.
[03:21:21.838 --> 03:21:23.639]  And it's all just falling in on him.
[03:21:23.639 --> 03:21:26.701]  It's all it's all falling apart right now in front of her.
[03:21:26.701 --> 03:21:31.044]  And her book is 50 percent off the day it went on sale.
[03:21:31.044 --> 03:21:31.885]  A total failure.
[03:21:32.431 --> 03:21:32.594]  Huh?
[03:21:34.099 --> 03:21:35.040]  Yeah, that's in London.
[03:21:35.040 --> 03:21:36.601]  It's in the article.
[03:21:36.601 --> 03:21:37.361]  It's reduced.
[03:21:37.361 --> 03:21:44.706]  It's on special offer already because nobody's interested because she's still on this cashing in on the butthurt whinge tour.
[03:21:44.706 --> 03:21:52.712]  Even her own fundraisers, Alex, have come out and said, you know, people who gave a bankroll during the election said, please shut the F up.
[03:21:52.712 --> 03:21:54.072]  They literally said that.
[03:21:54.072 --> 03:21:56.634]  They said, you're hurting the Democratic Party.
[03:21:56.634 --> 03:21:57.715]  Get over it.
[03:21:57.715 --> 03:22:02.038]  Take responsibility for how utterly pathetic you were and just go away.
[03:22:02.478 --> 03:22:06.939]  That's why everybody's saying to Hillary, she's so arrogant, she will not do it.
[03:22:06.939 --> 03:22:11.040]  She's still clinging on to that relevancy, even though everybody defies it.
[03:22:11.040 --> 03:22:15.702]  And isn't that indicative and archetypal of all the rest of the deep state losers?
[03:22:15.702 --> 03:22:19.543]  That are just so arrogant they can't believe the whole world's turning against them?
[03:22:20.885 --> 03:22:25.149]  They just can't understand that they no longer have complete control over everything.
[03:22:25.149 --> 03:22:26.951]  The narrative has changed.
[03:22:26.951 --> 03:22:30.554]  People don't buy into their crap anymore, but they can't move on.
[03:22:30.554 --> 03:22:32.957]  They're still living in a world that doesn't exist anymore.
[03:22:32.957 --> 03:22:37.882]  Do you know what King George III did when George Washington refused kingship and did a treaty with England?
[03:22:37.882 --> 03:22:41.986]  He said, George Washington is the greatest man alive in the world.
[03:22:42.586 --> 03:22:52.357]  Now, King George III had problems, but he at least was honorable enough to say, George Washington's a better man than me, and is the winner.
[03:22:52.357 --> 03:22:55.360]  Comparing King George, Paul, to somebody like Hillary Clinton.
[03:22:57.395 --> 03:23:03.080]  It's just that sociopathic tendency, Alex, where they just can't even consider... It's like Tony Blair with the Iraq War.
[03:23:03.080 --> 03:23:08.464]  Like, he still thinks he's right, you know, 14, 15 years later with the Iraq War.
[03:23:08.464 --> 03:23:11.006]  They convince themselves because they're sociopaths.
[03:23:11.006 --> 03:23:13.488]  That's what sociopaths are best at doing.
[03:23:13.488 --> 03:23:16.230]  They believe the lie, that's why they can sell you on one.
[03:23:17.284 --> 03:23:18.725]  Yeah, and it's like her entire book.
[03:23:18.725 --> 03:23:19.245]  What happened?
[03:23:19.245 --> 03:23:26.451]  Well, what happened was you screwed over Bernie Sanders and a ton of his voters didn't vote for you for that very reason.
[03:23:26.451 --> 03:23:28.632]  That's a huge part of why you lost.
[03:23:28.632 --> 03:23:30.834]  What happened is you were in bed with the media.
[03:23:30.834 --> 03:23:31.995]  It got exposed.
[03:23:31.995 --> 03:23:34.117]  People were sick of that cronyism.
[03:23:34.117 --> 03:23:35.458]  That's why you lost.
[03:23:35.458 --> 03:23:37.599]  Neither of those things are in her book.
[03:23:37.599 --> 03:23:38.620]  She's a sociopath.
[03:23:38.620 --> 03:23:41.102]  She won't face up to reality like all of them.
[03:23:41.786 --> 03:23:42.546]  That's right.
[03:23:42.546 --> 03:23:44.947]  Laura Loomer, I'm going to turn you over to Paul, who I just can't.
[03:23:44.947 --> 03:23:47.627]  Every day there's so much news I run into when he hosts Tuesday.
[03:23:47.627 --> 03:23:53.909]  I've talked Paul into joining David Knight once a week, myself once a week as well, and Owen Schroyer.
[03:23:53.909 --> 03:23:56.349]  But Laura, I want to salute you.
[03:23:56.349 --> 03:23:59.350]  Thank you for giving us the big first exclusive on this.
[03:23:59.350 --> 03:24:02.891]  So I know Paul's got another guest coming up as well, but Laura, other comments?
[03:24:02.891 --> 03:24:03.571]  Paul, you're in charge.
[03:24:05.342 --> 03:24:07.283]  Yeah, Laura, just go ahead with your final comments.
[03:24:07.283 --> 03:24:12.085]  I know you're probably eager to get something to drink and have a rest after waiting for seven, eight hours.
[03:24:12.085 --> 03:24:13.146]  Just your final comments.
[03:24:13.146 --> 03:24:15.707]  What was going through your mind when you approached Hillary?
[03:24:15.707 --> 03:24:16.968]  You were very polite.
[03:24:16.968 --> 03:24:18.128]  You said, hello, how you doing?
[03:24:18.128 --> 03:24:19.909]  It was a very polite conversation.
[03:24:19.909 --> 03:24:23.031]  God forbid you should ask a politician a question, right, Laura?
[03:24:24.269 --> 03:24:24.709]  Yeah, I know.
[03:24:24.709 --> 03:24:25.169]  God forbid.
[03:24:25.169 --> 03:24:28.070]  And that's why I was so taken aback by what the Secret Service said to me.
[03:24:28.070 --> 03:24:30.931]  It's because, you know, they were trying to mock me when I said I'm a journalist.
[03:24:30.931 --> 03:24:32.111]  They said, you're a journalist.
[03:24:32.111 --> 03:24:33.031]  Do you have any proof of that?
[03:24:33.031 --> 03:24:34.032]  And I said, yeah, look it up.
[03:24:34.032 --> 03:24:36.713]  And then they looked it up and they said, oh, we don't have any proof.
[03:24:36.713 --> 03:24:39.373]  And I've been investigating the Clintons for years.
[03:24:39.373 --> 03:24:45.235]  I mean, during my time at Project Veritas, I did many investigations which resulted in, you know,
[03:24:46.411 --> 03:24:51.357]  A lot of public humiliation and, you know, further investigation for the Clinton family.
[03:25:01.929 --> 03:25:04.890]  Laura, it's a game they play.
[03:25:04.890 --> 03:25:05.871]  You've been in Veritas.
[03:25:05.871 --> 03:25:10.393]  You're all over the place constantly going and confronting them about the murder Trump play.
[03:25:10.393 --> 03:25:11.773]  They just play that mind game.
[03:25:11.773 --> 03:25:12.814]  I just laugh at that.
[03:25:12.814 --> 03:25:14.935]  You go, yeah, we're the new media.
[03:25:14.935 --> 03:25:17.436]  You're who we're trying to shut down because we're winners.
[03:25:17.436 --> 03:25:19.857]  I mean, Hillary's book constantly talks about me.
[03:25:19.857 --> 03:25:21.418]  I mean, what are they supposed to do?
[03:25:22.538 --> 03:25:27.063]  I mean, all I want to say is that she welcomed this all the way.
[03:25:27.063 --> 03:25:28.524]  Why would you name your book What Happened?
[03:25:28.524 --> 03:25:31.687]  I mean, does she not think people were going to come to her events and ask her what happened?
[03:25:31.687 --> 03:25:36.752]  Because seriously, there's a lot of questions that she didn't answer during the election that people want answers to now.
[03:25:36.752 --> 03:25:37.513]  And I'm not going to stop.
[03:25:37.513 --> 03:25:38.594]  I mean, I'm going to ask these questions.
[03:25:41.244 --> 03:25:42.705]  That's all I have to say.
[03:25:58.257 --> 03:26:24.312]  Well look, Alex, I don't know if you remember, but about a month ago when she first announced the name of her book was what happened, I actually messaged Paul in advance and said this would be a wonderful InfoWars contest to have, because, you know, what you could do is you could say, go to her events, you know, go to these book signing events and ask her what happened, and they would just be scared absolutely shitless, because they would have all these citizen journalists armed with cell phones, and you can't take away everyone's cell phone, and they're going to ask her what happened, and it would just be a nightmare.
[03:26:24.312 --> 03:26:27.874]  I mean, you have to put these people on guard and let them know that we're everywhere.
[03:26:28.257 --> 03:26:30.580]  Well, looks like it just happened.
[03:26:30.580 --> 03:26:32.482]  So, there you go.
[03:26:32.482 --> 03:26:36.586]  Hillary Clinton's going to be... Imagine how much she hates me, because they have killed a lot of people.
[03:26:36.586 --> 03:26:38.248]  They do have hit men, and then they kill me.
[03:26:38.248 --> 03:26:39.289]  Yeah, be careful.
[03:26:39.289 --> 03:26:42.432]  If I get killed, look at Hillary Clinton as the main culprit, folks.
[03:26:42.432 --> 03:26:43.694]  I just want that said.
[03:26:43.694 --> 03:26:47.258]  She is a known murdering scumbag, and she's got to be stopped.
[03:26:47.258 --> 03:26:48.019]  Sorry, Paul, take over.
[03:26:49.366 --> 03:26:50.547]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[03:26:50.547 --> 03:26:53.628]  Yeah, I mean, and it's this whole thing that we don't have the right to reply.
[03:26:53.628 --> 03:26:56.110]  Number one, you know, who cares if you're a journalist or not?
[03:26:56.110 --> 03:26:59.391]  You're an American, you have a First Amendment, you asked a question!
[03:26:59.391 --> 03:26:59.892]  That's what I said!
[03:26:59.892 --> 03:27:00.952]  God forbid!
[03:27:00.952 --> 03:27:01.953]  That's the whole point, right?
[03:27:01.953 --> 03:27:03.374]  They freak out every time.
[03:27:03.374 --> 03:27:07.496]  It's like, all that's going to happen is that you're going to ask a question, then leave.
[03:27:07.496 --> 03:27:11.358]  The fact that they freak out every time makes it even worse for them, right?
[03:27:13.166 --> 03:27:14.287]  No, it makes it even worse.
[03:27:14.287 --> 03:27:18.029]  And the funniest part was they thought I was working in conspiracy with Martin Shkreli.
[03:27:18.029 --> 03:27:18.949]  They were so scared.
[03:27:18.949 --> 03:27:21.831]  They said, they asked me, are you on drugs?
[03:27:21.831 --> 03:27:24.832]  Are you, are you here to take a lock of Hillary's hair for $5,000?
[03:27:24.832 --> 03:27:30.555]  And I was laughing because I knew exactly what they were talking about, but they're so paranoid.
[03:27:30.555 --> 03:27:37.459]  I mean, she literally has secret service trying to protect her hair because they must really honestly think that somebody is trying to take a lock of her hair.
[03:27:37.939 --> 03:27:51.430]  I mean, I would be more worried about people with cell phone cameras trying to expose you for the crook and the liar and the fraud that you are, as opposed to somebody trying to approach you with some scissors and, you know, sell your hair for $5,000.
[03:27:51.430 --> 03:27:53.291]  It's absolutely insane, Laura.
[03:27:53.291 --> 03:27:55.613]  You were polite, you asked a few questions, big deal.
[03:27:55.613 --> 03:28:00.237]  The fact that they freaked out about it has made it an even bigger story, so that's more fool them, isn't it?
[03:28:00.237 --> 03:28:03.880]  Any final comments, Laura, then I'll let you get off and get a drink of water.
[03:28:05.265 --> 03:28:06.386]  I didn't get my book.
[03:28:06.386 --> 03:28:11.068]  They wouldn't let me take my signed copy of Hillary's book, even though I waited for seven hours.
[03:28:11.068 --> 03:28:14.509]  So if somebody wants to get me a signed copy, I would love you forever.
[03:28:14.509 --> 03:28:17.151]  I really just want a signed copy of what happened.
[03:28:19.893 --> 03:28:20.454]  All right.
[03:28:20.454 --> 03:28:21.695]  We're going to leave it there, Laura.
[03:28:21.695 --> 03:28:23.216]  Amazing confrontation.
[03:28:23.216 --> 03:28:29.361]  The article is up on Infowars.com and the Periscope is also up on your Twitter, Laura Loomer.
[03:28:29.361 --> 03:28:34.225]  And we'll be sure to get you back on soon and obviously stay in touch for any fallout from this.
[03:28:34.225 --> 03:28:35.727]  But again, amazing confrontation.
[03:28:35.727 --> 03:28:36.688]  Laura, thanks.
[03:28:36.688 --> 03:28:40.351]  Thank you.
[03:28:40.351 --> 03:28:41.472]  Okay, appreciate it, Laura.
[03:28:41.472 --> 03:28:43.133]  There goes Laura Loomer.
[03:28:43.133 --> 03:28:44.154]  Amazing confrontation.
[03:28:44.154 --> 03:28:46.336]  The article is up on Infowars.com.
[03:28:47.054 --> 03:28:50.255]  Hillary confronted during book signing what happened to Seth Rich.
[03:28:50.255 --> 03:28:56.498]  Of course, that was one of several questions that were asked of Hillary Clinton, none of which she answers in her actual book.
[03:28:56.498 --> 03:29:01.460]  It's just a continuation of cashing in on Butthurt, a WingeFest tour.
[03:29:01.460 --> 03:29:01.700]  And again,
[03:29:02.728 --> 03:29:10.115]  Every month or so, or even greater in regularity, she starts whining and bitching about Infowars and Alex Jones.
[03:29:10.115 --> 03:29:13.198]  And it's like, we have the right to reply.
[03:29:13.198 --> 03:29:15.861]  So this is one way in which we're going to reply.
[03:29:15.861 --> 03:29:18.884]  After the break, though, we've got an amazing guest coming up, Andrew Tate.
[03:29:19.444 --> 03:29:21.805]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:21.805 --> 03:29:24.366]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:49.898 --> 03:29:51.358]  December 23rd, 1776.
[03:29:51.358 --> 03:29:55.340]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[03:29:55.340 --> 03:30:00.341]  The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.
[03:30:00.341 --> 03:30:05.142]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[03:30:05.142 --> 03:30:07.783]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[03:30:07.783 --> 03:30:09.844]  Yet we have this consolation with us.
[03:30:09.844 --> 03:30:12.784]  At the heart of the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[03:30:12.784 --> 03:30:15.805]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[03:30:15.805 --> 03:30:18.446]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[03:30:18.766 --> 03:30:27.489]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods, and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[03:30:27.489 --> 03:30:35.871]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[03:30:35.871 --> 03:30:41.112]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[03:30:41.112 --> 03:30:46.094]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[03:30:46.974 --> 03:30:49.835]  Thomas Paine, the American Crisis.
[03:30:49.835 --> 03:30:51.715]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:30:51.715 --> 03:30:53.756]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:30:53.756 --> 03:30:56.656]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:30:56.656 --> 03:31:02.718]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:02.718 --> 03:31:11.900]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:31:11.900 --> 03:31:15.181]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[03:31:15.441 --> 03:31:19.443]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:19.443 --> 03:31:27.467]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:27.467 --> 03:31:28.548]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:29.634 --> 03:31:33.575]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:33.575 --> 03:31:37.156]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:37.156 --> 03:31:43.859]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:31:43.859 --> 03:31:48.040]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:50.293 --> 03:31:55.000]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:31:55.000 --> 03:32:05.657]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had
[03:32:05.777 --> 03:32:08.059]  Much better nutrition than we do today.
[03:32:08.059 --> 03:32:14.723]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[03:32:14.723 --> 03:32:17.265]  And so I set out to develop Caveman.
[03:32:17.265 --> 03:32:23.890]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[03:32:24.130 --> 03:32:24.810]  We're good.
[03:32:51.633 --> 03:32:58.638]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:32:58.638 --> 03:33:02.341]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:06.410 --> 03:33:09.472]  We're live, it is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:09.472 --> 03:33:22.222]  Going to have a great guest on here in a minute, Andrew Tate, to talk about the truth about depression, a subject that certainly gets a lot of people very riled up on Twitter because they don't want their orthodoxy to be questioned.
[03:33:22.222 --> 03:33:24.103]  Well, that's what we're all about here.
[03:33:24.103 --> 03:33:28.066]  So we're going to have a rational, civilised discussion about it.
[03:33:28.066 --> 03:33:33.270]  Going to go to Andrew in a second, but let's go back to this Hillary Clinton thing because let's not forget that Hillary
[03:33:34.148 --> 03:33:34.808]  Endorsed.
[03:33:34.808 --> 03:33:38.249]  She literally endorsed a website called Verit.
[03:33:38.249 --> 03:33:38.669]  Whack!
[03:33:38.669 --> 03:33:39.950]  What was it last week?
[03:33:39.950 --> 03:33:42.530]  Which literally means to conceal.
[03:33:42.530 --> 03:33:45.371]  Oh, but this is the bastion of independent truth.
[03:33:45.371 --> 03:33:48.852]  It's for the 68 million or whoever they said it was.
[03:33:48.852 --> 03:33:54.474]  It's not a complete echo chamber for everyone who agrees on and believes the same thing anyway, is it?
[03:33:54.474 --> 03:33:55.354]  No.
[03:33:55.354 --> 03:34:01.296]  And when someone actually challenged this claim on Verit, the beacon of truth for everything,
[03:34:02.085 --> 03:34:05.128]  Can't be questioned, because they're now actually deleting comments.
[03:34:05.128 --> 03:34:14.177]  I think it was a comment by Tim Pool, who is a YouTuber and journalist, who said, because they claimed that there was more right-wing terrorism across the world than...
[03:34:15.254 --> 03:34:19.898]  Islamic terrorism, of course he corrected that and said actually that's completely false.
[03:34:19.898 --> 03:34:21.339]  They deleted the comment.
[03:34:21.339 --> 03:34:25.543]  So don't try and post any truth on Verit.
[03:34:25.543 --> 03:34:28.426]  Otherwise it will be deleted in a hurry.
[03:34:28.426 --> 03:34:35.091]  Oh, but that's the bastion of credibility for everybody who already agrees with and believes the same thing as each other anyway.
[03:34:35.091 --> 03:34:39.135]  And that's Hillary Clinton's new way of fighting Trumpism.
[03:34:39.135 --> 03:34:40.156]  Yeah, good luck with that.
[03:34:41.846 --> 03:34:42.807]  We have an article here.
[03:34:42.807 --> 03:34:45.368]  Of course, we had the big 9-11 anniversary yesterday.
[03:34:45.368 --> 03:34:50.871]  Google's 9-11 tribute is pathetic, and look how they honoured a terror sympathiser.
[03:34:50.871 --> 03:34:54.172]  So, of course, there was the tribute to 9-11 anniversary yesterday.
[03:34:54.172 --> 03:34:58.875]  Google had a pathetic black ribbon on the front page of their website.
[03:34:58.875 --> 03:35:02.277]  Of course, normally, it's a virtue signal.
[03:35:02.277 --> 03:35:04.698]  They go all out when it's the anniversary of anything.
[03:35:04.698 --> 03:35:08.600]  But when it came to 9-11, they made the least effort possible.
[03:35:09.702 --> 03:35:13.304]  The article says, every time there's virtue to be signaled, they pull out all the stops.
[03:35:13.304 --> 03:35:22.390]  Google is bound to have pissed off millions with their practically non-existent acknowledgement of the events that occurred on September 11, 2001.
[03:35:22.390 --> 03:35:29.194]  So if you took a look at the Google homepage yesterday, it was just a black ribbon, a simple small black ribbon at the bottom of the screen.
[03:35:29.944 --> 03:35:36.749]  Not an image of the Twin Towers, the police and firefighters who saved countless lives that day, or even the American flag.
[03:35:36.749 --> 03:35:39.490]  God forbid we could have the American flag.
[03:35:39.490 --> 03:35:46.935]  And in fact they honoured a Maoist Osama Bin Laden supporter more than they did the actual heroes of 9-11.
[03:35:46.935 --> 03:35:48.116]  That is Google for you.
[03:35:48.116 --> 03:35:50.778]  But we're going to go to our guest now because we have him on the line.
[03:35:51.278 --> 03:35:57.205]  He is three-time ISKA kickboxing world champion, son of chess master Emery Tate.
[03:35:57.205 --> 03:36:01.490]  He is Andrew Tate at Cobra Tate on Twitter.
[03:36:01.490 --> 03:36:07.658]  And he started a triggering of immense proportions amongst verified liberals on Twitter over the past few days.
[03:36:08.593 --> 03:36:12.634]  When he tweeted, this is the tweet, depression isn't real.
[03:36:12.634 --> 03:36:14.455]  You feel sad, you move on.
[03:36:14.455 --> 03:36:17.696]  You will always be depressed if your life is depressing.
[03:36:17.696 --> 03:36:18.657]  Changed it.
[03:36:18.657 --> 03:36:19.657]  Change it!
[03:36:19.657 --> 03:36:24.239]  And of course the response to that when I said I was going to have him on the show today, this is one example.
[03:36:24.239 --> 03:36:29.120]  Someone tweeted at me, an unqualified idiot interviews another unqualified idiot.
[03:36:29.120 --> 03:36:29.981]  Amazing stuff.
[03:36:29.981 --> 03:36:30.941]  They will bond well.
[03:36:31.641 --> 03:36:36.783]  Well, apologies, but noted doctor and mental health expert J.K.
[03:36:36.783 --> 03:36:39.544]  Rowling was unavailable for interview.
[03:36:39.544 --> 03:36:40.884]  So I'm talking with Andrew Tate.
[03:36:40.884 --> 03:36:46.326]  And that's what really gets to me, this idea that, oh, you have to be an expert to talk about anything.
[03:36:46.326 --> 03:36:50.888]  You have to be an expert, a medical doctor, a psychiatrist to talk about depression.
[03:36:50.888 --> 03:36:54.029]  Oh, but by the way, if you write children's books about wizards,
[03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:55.151]  Like J.K.
[03:36:55.151 --> 03:36:56.112]  Rowling does.
[03:36:56.112 --> 03:37:01.722]  You're an anointed expert on absolutely everything, and you're the bastion of credibility.
[03:37:01.722 --> 03:37:05.288]  No, we're going to talk about it, even if it triggers you.
[03:37:05.288 --> 03:37:06.090]  So let's do it.
[03:37:06.090 --> 03:37:07.192]  Andrew, welcome to the show.
[03:37:08.021 --> 03:37:08.921]  Thank you very much.
[03:37:08.921 --> 03:37:15.804]  And you made a fantastic point with that argument of authority that, you know, you must be qualified to have an opinion on something.
[03:37:15.804 --> 03:37:20.705]  If that was the case, I think every single person who's ever voted would need a doctorate in political science.
[03:37:20.705 --> 03:37:22.206]  And of course, that's absolutely not the case.
[03:37:22.206 --> 03:37:26.127]  You're allowed to have an informed opinion with or without a doctorate.
[03:37:26.127 --> 03:37:31.549]  And as you said, most of the verified liberals who replied to me were absolutely qualified in nothing.
[03:37:31.549 --> 03:37:33.310]  So it's ridiculous for them to even say.
[03:37:34.204 --> 03:37:37.990]  Well, it's like saying that women shouldn't be allowed to vote because they're not informed enough.
[03:37:37.990 --> 03:37:39.472]  It's just not an argument.
[03:37:39.472 --> 03:37:40.173]  Like, J.K.
[03:37:40.173 --> 03:37:42.677]  Rowling's a psychiatrist expert.
[03:37:42.677 --> 03:37:43.197]  No.
[03:37:43.197 --> 03:37:44.880]  We're going to have an opinion on it.
[03:37:44.880 --> 03:37:46.182]  You know, deal with it.
[03:37:46.182 --> 03:37:47.764]  But anyway, let's get into it, right?
[03:37:47.764 --> 03:37:49.587]  Antidepressant usage in America
[03:37:49.907 --> 03:37:52.588]  Well, I think this whole epidemic about depression is basically
[03:38:14.264 --> 03:38:16.505]  A misunderstanding of what depression is.
[03:38:16.505 --> 03:38:34.075]  People are talking about depression like it's this big external monster, like it's this condition you're going to catch regardless, like the common cold and it's something that can't be avoided, regardless of how good your life is and how perfect your life is, it's going to strike out of nowhere and you have zero self-control and zero ability to fight against it.
[03:38:34.075 --> 03:38:35.616]  And when people believe this rhetoric,
[03:38:36.169 --> 03:38:37.110]  When people like J.K.
[03:38:37.110 --> 03:38:47.200]  Rowling and these celebrities think that they're destroying the stigma, as they were saying, I was propagating a stigma, all they're doing is telling people, you're helpless to control your own mind.
[03:38:47.200 --> 03:38:51.003]  You're helpless to defend yourself against any kind of negative thought.
[03:38:51.003 --> 03:38:55.508]  And the only answer is to completely circum and surrender and take these pills.
[03:38:56.148 --> 03:38:59.312]  I do not believe depression is the monster people are saying it is.
[03:38:59.312 --> 03:39:02.235]  I believe it's a situational phenomenon.
[03:39:02.235 --> 03:39:07.501]  If you're in a situation you're unhappy with, if you're in depressing surroundings, you're going to feel depressed.
[03:39:07.501 --> 03:39:14.950]  If you decide to be proactive and get healthy and build a business and do good things with your life, you're going to be proud of yourself and you're going to be happy.
[03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:16.412]  I think this is fairly obvious.
[03:39:17.392 --> 03:39:33.596]  And a lot of the reason that these young people are suffering from depression is because they're lazy, or they're dissatisfied with their life, and instead of thinking, oh, I need to do something about this, they buy into the propaganda which is being splurted out by people like J.K.
[03:39:33.596 --> 03:39:40.298]  Rowling, and they think the only answer is to take pills because depression is a horrible monster that struck them out of nowhere, and that's absolutely false.
[03:39:40.298 --> 03:39:40.818]  It's not true.
[03:39:41.986 --> 03:40:03.952]  Now, to be clear, Andrew, when we talk about depression, and we are talking about the majority of cases, we're not denying that traumatic events, grief, for example, PTSD for soldiers who fight in wars, you know, losing the loved one or whatever, specific traumatic events, we're not denying that those things can cause even long-term depression, right?
[03:40:03.952 --> 03:40:10.534]  We're talking about something that's related to bad lifestyle choices, not individual traumatic events.
[03:40:11.638 --> 03:40:12.239]  Absolutely.
[03:40:12.239 --> 03:40:18.684]  It's perfectly normal for a human being to feel sad or depressed or upset about something or upset about a situation.
[03:40:18.684 --> 03:40:19.644]  I'm not saying that.
[03:40:19.644 --> 03:40:26.750]  When I said depression wasn't real, I was discussing people's attitude towards depression because people's attitude towards depression is, I've caught depression.
[03:40:27.290 --> 03:40:28.711]  It's like Ebola, you know?
[03:40:28.711 --> 03:40:35.838]  I was going through my life, and everything was fine, and I love everything, but I caught depression, and now it's impossible for me to be happy.
[03:40:35.838 --> 03:40:37.639]  And that is absolutely not true.
[03:40:37.639 --> 03:40:41.442]  Everyone has been sad, everyone has felt depressed, but you have two kinds of people.
[03:40:41.442 --> 03:40:52.252]  You have people who accept it's part of being human, accept it's part of life, and push forward, and you have people who succumb to it completely, and decide there's nothing they can do about it, and the whole world should feel sorry for them.
[03:40:52.632 --> 03:41:00.074]  When I pointed this out to people, people got extremely violent with their defense, and that's purely because the truth often upsets people it doesn't favor.
[03:41:00.074 --> 03:41:06.075]  It doesn't favor people who like to have excuses for their life, and that's why they were so desperate to defend it.
[03:41:06.075 --> 03:41:14.017]  If depression is such a horrible monster, and I'm saying there's a way around it, there's a way you can feel better, the fact that they'll come on Twitter and wish my death
[03:41:14.537 --> 03:41:15.838]  We're trying to tell them they can feel better.
[03:41:15.838 --> 03:41:21.000]  It shows just how desperate they are to have this excuse for their life and their life choices.
[03:41:21.000 --> 03:41:25.461]  Depression is absolutely situational and you have a choice if you're going to succumb to depression or not.
[03:41:25.461 --> 03:41:27.382]  It's as simple as that.
[03:41:27.382 --> 03:41:31.664]  Which is why it's kind of ironic when you get accused of being harmful by J.K.
[03:41:31.664 --> 03:41:35.945]  Rowling for committing this blasphemy and that's basically what it is at this point.
[03:41:35.945 --> 03:41:41.747]  These people are more militant than vegans when you question veganism and that's quite a high bar.
[03:41:41.747 --> 03:41:42.988]  But the irony behind it is
[03:41:43.548 --> 03:41:52.114]  They're the ones telling people there's nothing you can do about it, succumb to it, take pills, yet depression and suicides just keep on increasing.
[03:41:52.114 --> 03:41:58.558]  So if anything, they're the ones who are harmful to young generation especially, telling them that they can't do anything about it.
[03:41:58.558 --> 03:42:00.439]  But let me throw this one at you, Andrew.
[03:42:00.979 --> 03:42:24.371]  If we accept that the majority of cases of depression, which of course most people don't, but that's our position on it, I did a video on this a few months ago, but if we accept that a lot of it is related to bad lifestyle choices, how do we explain people who have had success, who have accomplished things, I'm talking about people like Buzz Aldrin, historical figures like Winston Churchill complained about having depression, even Abraham Lincoln,
[03:42:24.671 --> 03:42:34.195]  You have a ton of sports stars, successful actors, actresses that achieve great success but then go on to be depressed anyway.
[03:42:34.195 --> 03:42:39.618]  How do we explain that if we're saying that depression is about people not achieving life goals and making bad choices?
[03:42:40.615 --> 03:42:50.199]  Well, I think depression is absolutely reactionary to your surroundings, so you can be successful and still be unhappy with certain elements of your life, which can still lead you down a path of depression.
[03:42:50.199 --> 03:42:52.820]  But it's very interesting you mentioned Winston Churchill, for example.
[03:42:52.820 --> 03:42:59.262]  He said he was depressed, yet still functioned, still led the country in a war, and was successful.
[03:42:59.262 --> 03:43:07.886]  He didn't do what a lot of these young people nowadays are doing when they say they're depressed and just refuse to work, pretend they can't get out of bed, pretend it's absolutely impossible for them to go to the gym.
[03:43:08.387 --> 03:43:12.761]  While he managed to achieve amazing things whilst fighting he had depression than others.
[03:43:12.761 --> 03:43:14.506]  And I think one of the main reasons why...
[03:43:15.316 --> 03:43:21.279]  Especially nowadays, in the modern world, these celebrities succumb to depression.
[03:43:21.279 --> 03:43:23.661]  It's because they believe the stigma.
[03:43:23.661 --> 03:43:27.463]  They believe the stigma that people are saying I'm propagating is not a harmful stigma.
[03:43:27.463 --> 03:43:30.025]  The stigma that has been propagated by people like J.K.
[03:43:30.025 --> 03:43:31.605]  Rowling is the harmful stigma.
[03:43:31.605 --> 03:43:37.689]  The idea that there is this unbeatable, untreatable, crazy monster that will enter your life and destroy you.
[03:43:37.689 --> 03:43:40.310]  If you believe that, you are going to lose.
[03:43:40.310 --> 03:43:43.612]  If you externalize any problem in the world, you're going to lose.
[03:43:43.612 --> 03:43:44.393]  If you're an alcoholic,
[03:43:44.993 --> 03:43:48.234]  And you want to say, I have alcoholism.
[03:43:48.234 --> 03:44:00.456]  You're in a losing fight if you believe that this is something that you can't help and it's going to destroy your life while you continue to get up, go to the store, buy alcohol, drink alcohol, and come home and do it on repeat.
[03:44:00.456 --> 03:44:02.237]  And you want to pretend it's nothing to do with you.
[03:44:02.237 --> 03:44:03.277]  So it's a white flag.
[03:44:03.277 --> 03:44:04.857]  Alex Jones here, Andrew Tate.
[03:44:04.857 --> 03:44:06.317]  I'm having my lunch watching you and Paul.
[03:44:06.317 --> 03:44:09.678]  I just got to invite you on my main show because I was already aware of your work.
[03:44:09.678 --> 03:44:11.858]  It's amazing hearing you speak with Paul.
[03:44:11.858 --> 03:44:13.219]  It's so rational and real.
[03:44:13.219 --> 03:44:14.079]  There's a spectrum.
[03:44:15.019 --> 03:44:16.600]  A responsibility in life.
[03:44:16.600 --> 03:44:19.541]  If you're not doing the right thing, you're going to feel depressed.
[03:44:19.541 --> 03:44:24.423]  So that's a motivation for me when I'm not doing enough and not executing the way I know.
[03:44:24.423 --> 03:44:29.085]  Then I'll get a little bit bummed out, but that is something to ignite the fury in me to have victory.
[03:44:29.085 --> 03:44:29.786]  But beyond that...
[03:44:30.666 --> 03:44:34.328]  If you drink a bottle of whiskey, you've got a huge headache from inflammation.
[03:44:34.328 --> 03:44:35.969]  That causes depression.
[03:44:35.969 --> 03:44:38.151]  It goes away once you're hydrated.
[03:44:38.151 --> 03:44:40.572]  If you've got heat stroke, it feels like you're depressed.
[03:44:40.572 --> 03:44:46.556]  If I get sunburned or hike 20 miles and don't drink enough water and get dehydrated, I feel depressed until I drink enough electrolytes.
[03:44:46.556 --> 03:44:52.580]  So, there's a lot of things in here, but all the studies show forest bathing, getting outside, that empowers us.
[03:44:52.580 --> 03:44:54.461]  Only watching TV, staying indoors.
[03:44:54.801 --> 03:44:56.642]  Not getting enough sunlight in our eyes.
[03:44:56.642 --> 03:44:58.383]  That causes depression.
[03:44:58.383 --> 03:45:00.085]  So we ask, why is it all getting worse?
[03:45:00.085 --> 03:45:04.127]  This indoor, sedentary lifestyle is the main trigger.
[03:45:04.127 --> 03:45:09.631]  Then the drugs are admittedly more dangerous than anything out there.
[03:45:09.631 --> 03:45:11.412]  And so there's a lot of factors.
[03:45:11.412 --> 03:45:13.994]  And Big Pharma has these people like J.K.
[03:45:13.994 --> 03:45:14.434]  Rawlings.
[03:45:14.674 --> 03:45:15.335]  Thank you.
[03:45:38.456 --> 03:45:40.097]  And I completely, completely agree with you.
[03:45:40.097 --> 03:45:54.349]  I mean, the number one way you stop anybody being concerned with the real issues of this world, the real issues that we discuss on this show, is to make them so concerned and caught up in the fact that someone said a bad word to them once, that they're now depressed because of internet bullying.
[03:45:54.349 --> 03:45:58.253]  I've just been internet bullied for three days straight, and I can guarantee you I'm zero percent depressed.
[03:45:58.253 --> 03:45:58.833]  So that's it.
[03:45:58.833 --> 03:46:00.154]  In fact, you're empowered.
[03:46:00.154 --> 03:46:01.675]  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
[03:46:01.675 --> 03:46:04.518]  They're turning them into permanent basket case victims.
[03:46:06.389 --> 03:46:07.590]  Absolutely, it's crazy.
[03:46:07.590 --> 03:46:14.680]  You know, the thing about it, especially when you're talking about the antidepressants, someone said to me, someone tweeted at me, like, what about Robin Williams?
[03:46:14.680 --> 03:46:16.763]  And I did some very 10-second research.
[03:46:16.763 --> 03:46:21.350]  I saw that Robin Williams saw a psychiatrist for 12 years before he eventually committed suicide.
[03:46:21.989 --> 03:46:38.145]  And my understanding is as follows, if he would have walked into that psychiatrist's office and said, I'm depressed, and the psychiatrist said, my friend, you're a millionaire, you're famous, you don't even have to grow old gracefully, you can have 19 year old girlfriends for the rest of your life, the people in here have real problems, stop embarrassing yourself, get out of here.
[03:46:38.145 --> 03:46:39.527]  To this day, he'd still be alive.
[03:46:40.307 --> 03:46:44.510]  That's the point, Andrew.
[03:46:44.510 --> 03:46:47.633]  I mean, it's not as if we've pulled this out of thin air, okay?
[03:46:47.633 --> 03:46:49.134]  It's called Stoicism.
[03:46:49.134 --> 03:46:50.875]  It's a branch of philosophy.
[03:46:50.875 --> 03:46:53.677]  This is a real, you know, movement of thought.
[03:46:53.677 --> 03:46:57.080]  We haven't just made it up and started making YouTube videos about it.
[03:46:57.080 --> 03:47:01.423]  This exists as a branch of philosophy and as a way of treating depression.
[03:47:01.423 --> 03:47:02.544]  I want to ask you, Andrew, though,
[03:47:03.044 --> 03:47:04.425]  You know, we talked about the stigma.
[03:47:04.425 --> 03:47:09.208]  To what extent is society and culture to blame for fetishizing depression?
[03:47:09.208 --> 03:47:13.130]  Because now we're told, of course, that it's normal to be emotionally incontinent.
[03:47:13.130 --> 03:47:16.632]  You have people on television constantly breaking down in tears.
[03:47:16.632 --> 03:47:19.854]  That's basically the foundation of reality television.
[03:47:19.854 --> 03:47:25.417]  You know, YouTube is full of these privileged whiny millennial brats talking about how depressed they are for views.
[03:47:25.417 --> 03:47:31.521]  How much has depression become a kind of virtue signaling for narcissists who just want attention?
[03:47:32.583 --> 03:47:41.386]  Narcissist is completely the right word because the reality of Earth and the reality of life is that everybody is trying to be, to a degree, individual.
[03:47:41.386 --> 03:47:42.166]  Everyone is.
[03:47:42.166 --> 03:47:45.207]  It doesn't matter if you're chasing money so you can have the car other people can't have.
[03:47:45.207 --> 03:47:46.227]  It doesn't matter if you're a kickboxer.
[03:47:46.227 --> 03:47:47.227]  It doesn't matter if you're a journalist.
[03:47:47.227 --> 03:47:48.908]  It doesn't matter what you do.
[03:47:48.908 --> 03:47:53.809]  If you have a healthy, normal human mindset, you're going to want to do something to differentiate yourself.
[03:47:53.809 --> 03:48:00.311]  And the easiest cop-out, the easiest cop-out to be different is to wake up and for no reason say, I have bipolar.
[03:48:00.931 --> 03:48:01.832]  I have ADHD.
[03:48:01.832 --> 03:48:03.173]  I have depression.
[03:48:03.173 --> 03:48:03.754]  I have this.
[03:48:03.754 --> 03:48:04.675]  I'm special.
[03:48:04.675 --> 03:48:05.756]  I'm not like everyone else.
[03:48:05.756 --> 03:48:06.596]  I have this.
[03:48:06.596 --> 03:48:10.220]  And this is just an absolute cop-out on a desperate bid for individuality.
[03:48:10.220 --> 03:48:23.732]  Since I tweeted this, I've had tens of thousands of people inbox me saying, I'm depressed, and I have ADHD, and I have this, and I have that, and naming 25 diseases as if they're some kind of amazing, unique, special snowflake I'm never going to be possible to understand.
[03:48:23.732 --> 03:48:25.213]  I understand you're lazy.
[03:48:25.613 --> 03:48:32.599]  I understand you're incapable of concentrating on something long enough to give yourself a differentiating factor in life other than just complaining.
[03:48:32.599 --> 03:48:34.241]  And that's the world we live in now.
[03:48:34.241 --> 03:48:35.482]  And we're supposed to accept this.
[03:48:35.482 --> 03:48:37.023]  When I meet someone... Well, absolutely.
[03:48:37.023 --> 03:48:42.408]  I've read the three-volume History of the British Peoples by Churchill, an amazing guy.
[03:48:42.408 --> 03:48:43.709]  And I wouldn't even call it really depression.
[03:48:43.709 --> 03:48:44.750]  It was more stoic.
[03:48:44.750 --> 03:48:51.976]  He was super serious and had such responsibility and was so focused with the weight and the will he had that he was just...
[03:48:52.316 --> 03:48:52.776]  I don't know.
[03:49:18.700 --> 03:49:19.660]  Yeah, I think yeah.
[03:49:19.660 --> 03:49:23.742]  The depression Winston Churchill suffered from allowed him to win World War II.
[03:49:23.742 --> 03:49:35.606]  The depression that these millennial brats suffer from prevent them from working at McDonald's because they believe they're entitled to millions for no reason and they want to have a car like everyone else on Instagram and they don't see why they're not instantly happy without any kind of hard work.
[03:49:35.606 --> 03:49:36.727]  They're completely different things.
[03:49:36.727 --> 03:49:40.688]  To compare the two depressions isn't even accurate in my perspective.
[03:49:40.688 --> 03:49:48.251]  When I see these 19 year olds with nothing wrong with their life saying they're depressed, they genuinely need nothing more than to man up and be told the truth and that's the absolute
[03:49:48.311 --> 03:49:49.372]  That's the point, Andrew.
[03:49:49.372 --> 03:49:50.073]  That's the word.
[03:49:50.073 --> 03:49:50.853]  Entitlement.
[03:49:50.853 --> 03:49:53.736]  It's like no one's entitled to be happy, okay?
[03:49:53.736 --> 03:49:57.420]  You earn happiness through hard work and good choices.
[03:49:57.420 --> 03:50:01.123]  Your mood can't be independent of the way you live your life.
[03:50:01.123 --> 03:50:06.448]  The two not only complement on each other, they're completely dependent on each other.
[03:50:06.448 --> 03:50:11.293]  Again, it's this whiny millennial entitled society that just thinks that they can go through life
[03:50:11.633 --> 03:50:16.855]  Being rewarded without having to put hard work, effort in, and not making bad choices.
[03:50:16.855 --> 03:50:22.898]  And we're not saying that that's all depression, that depression doesn't exist if people lose loved ones, if they have PTSD.
[03:50:22.898 --> 03:50:29.101]  But that is a huge majority of the cases, and when we come back after the break, I just want to talk briefly about the pharmaceutical aspect to this.
[03:50:29.101 --> 03:50:30.501]  Paul, I'm skipping the break!
[03:50:30.501 --> 03:50:34.223]  Paul, when I pop in and take over... Let's go for it, let's skip the break.
[03:50:34.223 --> 03:50:36.424]  Andrew, let's talk about the pharmaceutical aspect.
[03:50:37.104 --> 03:50:44.993]  I mentioned the fact that depression in America or anti-depressant usage has increased 400% over the past two decades.
[03:50:44.993 --> 03:50:48.457]  It's been re-characterized as a pathological disease.
[03:50:48.457 --> 03:50:50.519]  It's a lifelong medical condition.
[03:50:50.519 --> 03:50:53.041]  That wasn't the case less than 50 years ago.
[03:50:53.041 --> 03:50:55.144]  It was seen as temporary unhappiness.
[03:50:55.604 --> 03:51:07.214]  Do you think that there could be any kind of motivation, Andrew, for massive pharmaceutical companies to turn this into a pathological disease, therefore creating a profit motive?
[03:51:07.214 --> 03:51:08.736]  Do you think that's possible at all?
[03:51:09.703 --> 03:51:10.524]  It's more than possible.
[03:51:10.524 --> 03:51:12.484]  And there's two things I want to say on this.
[03:51:12.484 --> 03:51:28.512]  And the first thing, which is quite important, is that I believe people like Robin Williams, the reason they killed themselves is because for 12 years they sat in a psychiatrist's office talking about bad things, every bad thing that's ever happened to them, ever, while taking mind-altering drugs daily.
[03:51:28.972 --> 03:51:30.773]  Messing with their brain chemistry.
[03:51:30.773 --> 03:51:32.774]  It doesn't matter how mentally strong you are.
[03:51:32.774 --> 03:51:40.077]  They could put me in that scenario and alter my drug, alter my brain chemistry with these drugs and talk about bad things every day for 12 years.
[03:51:40.077 --> 03:51:41.918]  I'll feel like killing myself the same.
[03:51:41.918 --> 03:51:44.760]  So the reason he eventually did it is not because of depression.
[03:51:44.760 --> 03:51:46.480]  It's because of the treatment to depression.
[03:51:46.480 --> 03:51:49.882]  The treatment to depression is what's making these things even worse.
[03:51:49.882 --> 03:51:51.623]  You know, that's the first point I want to make.
[03:51:52.083 --> 03:52:02.018]  And the second point I want to make is it's amazing, like you said, where depression is more commonplace in these rich countries where people can afford these kind of, you know, treatments.
[03:52:02.018 --> 03:52:06.885]  It's amazing that this disease or this chronic illness seems to respect country borders.
[03:52:06.885 --> 03:52:07.346]  It's the only
[03:52:07.666 --> 03:52:15.591]  Illness I've never ever found that of course if it's not situational has nothing to do with your situation it should be universal across the human race.
[03:52:15.591 --> 03:52:22.235]  It should be exactly the same on a tiny little island in the Pacific as it is in America but it's nothing to do with the situation you're living in.
[03:52:22.235 --> 03:52:28.839]  So I don't know at what point depression is getting to the getting to the customs office and saying oh no I haven't got a visa I can't go over there.
[03:52:28.839 --> 03:52:29.820]  It's ridiculous.
[03:52:29.820 --> 03:52:33.662]  The reason people are not depressed over there is because no one buys into this garbage.
[03:52:33.662 --> 03:52:34.683]  It's not a real thing.
[03:52:35.243 --> 03:52:40.285]  And it's just an externalization that allows them to absolve responsibility from their life.
[03:52:40.285 --> 03:52:41.446]  And you said it perfectly, Paul.
[03:52:41.446 --> 03:52:43.167]  You said it absolutely perfectly.
[03:52:43.167 --> 03:52:50.430]  If depression was something, if your mindset was completely independent to the life you live, why wouldn't we all just catch a case and go to jail?
[03:52:50.430 --> 03:52:55.552]  You get free room, free board, you haven't got to work a job, and I should be happy and they're just the same.
[03:52:55.552 --> 03:52:56.272]  Absolutely not.
[03:52:56.272 --> 03:52:59.714]  I'd be a depressed individual because my surroundings are depressing.
[03:52:59.714 --> 03:53:02.595]  So, it's in these rich countries, exactly as you said.
[03:53:02.595 --> 03:53:04.296]  But it's not your opinion, Andrew or Paul.
[03:53:05.779 --> 03:53:11.573]  All the major antidepressants have to put a warning on the label that it causes psychotic breaks, suicide, and megalomania.
[03:53:12.321 --> 03:53:13.742]  There's the proof!
[03:53:13.742 --> 03:53:15.923]  And is this what they're saying to treat depression?
[03:53:15.923 --> 03:53:21.987]  You know, I read something really interesting when someone tweeted at me saying there's zero evidence from my standpoint.
[03:53:21.987 --> 03:53:34.716]  Lauren Mosher was the former chief of schizophrenic research at the National Institute of Mental Health, and he concluded after two years of study that there is no biological condition of depression because in 100% of cases, there's nothing actually wrong with the brain.
[03:53:34.716 --> 03:53:38.719]  He can't detect anything wrong with the human brain for these depressed people.
[03:53:38.719 --> 03:53:39.759]  There's nothing wrong with their brain.
[03:53:39.759 --> 03:53:42.061]  There's something wrong with their state of mind and their outlook on life.
[03:53:42.502 --> 03:53:46.510]  And that's something that needs to be changed with willpower and understanding.
[03:53:46.510 --> 03:53:50.939]  Instead, the psychiatrist and psychologist hypnotize you into deeper mental illness.
[03:53:51.866 --> 03:53:53.287]  Absolutely!
[03:53:53.287 --> 03:53:57.990]  Who wants to sit there and talk about everything bad that's ever happened to them, ever, while taking mind-altering drugs?
[03:53:57.990 --> 03:54:00.051]  I'd be afraid to go down that path.
[03:54:00.051 --> 03:54:05.495]  You know, any normal human on Earth is going to end up depressed and semi-suicidal after that process.
[03:54:05.495 --> 03:54:11.279]  As opposed to me saying, how you cure depression is to wake up and take control of your life and build a life you're happy with.
[03:54:11.279 --> 03:54:12.900]  And people attack me like I'm the monster.
[03:54:13.981 --> 03:54:20.272]  It's really crazy how violently people defend... Because you're up against a big industry, Andrew and Paul.
[03:54:20.272 --> 03:54:21.113]  I'm done.
[03:54:21.113 --> 03:54:23.297]  This is riveting radio and TV.
[03:54:23.297 --> 03:54:23.657]  Sorry, Paul.
[03:54:23.657 --> 03:54:23.878]  Go ahead.
[03:54:24.389 --> 03:54:43.259]  Yeah, it's also because their whole life is invested in this life story, this narrative that they've told themselves for years and years, maybe decades in some cases, that their lack of willpower, their lack of success in their own personal life is due to this outside force, so then they never have to take responsibility for it, Andrew.
[03:54:44.247 --> 03:54:44.827]  Absolutely.
[03:54:44.827 --> 03:54:47.388]  And this is the number one goal of a loser.
[03:54:47.388 --> 03:54:52.850]  When I said depressives were losers, I obviously weren't talking about military veterans who lost their legs.
[03:54:52.850 --> 03:54:53.410]  Of course I wasn't.
[03:54:53.410 --> 03:54:56.792]  I was talking about the 19-year-old in their bedroom with nothing wrong with their life.
[03:54:56.792 --> 03:54:57.612]  And the number one
[03:54:58.234 --> 03:55:01.516]  The goal of a loser is to absolve responsibility.
[03:55:01.516 --> 03:55:03.258]  I'm fat because of my thyroid.
[03:55:03.258 --> 03:55:04.999]  I'm sad because of depression.
[03:55:04.999 --> 03:55:07.101]  I drink because of alcoholism.
[03:55:07.101 --> 03:55:09.442]  No matter what it is, it's not their fault.
[03:55:09.442 --> 03:55:12.104]  And they will do anything to defend their excuse.
[03:55:12.104 --> 03:55:15.767]  As long as they can defend their excuse, that's the most important thing for them.
[03:55:15.767 --> 03:55:20.330]  They don't want to sit there and go, well, this Andrew Tate guy, he grew up broke and he made something of himself.
[03:55:20.330 --> 03:55:23.633]  And I grew up privileged and I made nothing of myself.
[03:55:23.633 --> 03:55:25.114]  I must have caught something from the sky.
[03:55:25.114 --> 03:55:26.475]  No, they just don't want to accept reality.
[03:55:26.475 --> 03:55:27.476]  They don't want to face facts.
[03:55:27.956 --> 03:55:30.437]  And this is when I put it out there to them.
[03:55:30.437 --> 03:55:34.899]  The reason everyone got so instantly angry was because they knew it was true.
[03:55:34.899 --> 03:55:38.561]  If I were to tweet something like I'm the king of the world, no one would care because it's not true.
[03:55:38.561 --> 03:55:40.622]  When you say something which is a fact, which is
[03:55:41.297 --> 03:55:41.537]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:55:59.794 --> 03:56:04.518]  I was a bit depressed because I was a bit of a loser who didn't have anything going on in my life.
[03:56:04.518 --> 03:56:08.741]  As soon as I found what I wanted to do with my life, I was the most happiest I'd ever been.
[03:56:08.741 --> 03:56:12.044]  Again, we're not saying that's the case for everyone, but that's the general trend.
[03:56:12.044 --> 03:56:14.726]  I want to throw you another one, Andrew, this is the final minute here.
[03:56:14.726 --> 03:56:17.889]  So, of course, men are five times more likely to commit suicide.
[03:56:17.889 --> 03:56:25.935]  Given society's, you know, increased pressure on men to succeed, does that validate your point that depression is caused by a lack of achievement?
[03:56:26.315 --> 03:56:32.380]  Or is it more to do with the fact that women, you know, find it easier to get emotional support for depression?
[03:56:32.380 --> 03:56:33.941]  That's a really, really interesting question.
[03:56:33.941 --> 03:56:41.687]  And my answer on that is that I genuinely believe if you ask a lot of these people who are depressed, why they're depressed, the word lonely often pops up.
[03:56:41.687 --> 03:56:44.949]  And I don't believe a woman can ever be lonely the way a man is.
[03:56:44.949 --> 03:56:51.014]  I know very low quality, very ugly, very stupid females who still manage to go to the nightclub and not go home alone.
[03:56:51.514 --> 03:57:02.977]  If you're a man of a particular standing, if you're a man without any particular merits, if you're a man without any money, without any intelligence, you're not particularly good looking, there's a degree of loneliness that you're going to suffer that a woman's never going to suffer.
[03:57:02.977 --> 03:57:04.678]  That does not make depression real.
[03:57:04.678 --> 03:57:06.158]  That makes loneliness real.
[03:57:06.158 --> 03:57:12.220]  And that means that humans have evolved biologically to seek a mate and you're unhappy that you don't have a girlfriend.
[03:57:12.220 --> 03:57:12.680]  That's fine.
[03:57:12.680 --> 03:57:15.521]  That does not prove depression is real under any circumstance.
[03:57:15.521 --> 03:57:16.621]  That proves loneliness is real.
[03:57:16.621 --> 03:57:19.962]  And that's the reason I believe that men suffer from it more than women because men can
[03:57:20.562 --> 03:57:24.187]  You know, suffer loneliness like a woman really never can.
[03:57:24.187 --> 03:57:28.673]  I don't believe there's very many women out there who could ever be as genuinely as lonely as some of these men are.
[03:57:28.673 --> 03:57:30.355]  That's my point of view on it.
[03:57:30.355 --> 03:57:32.298]  All right, Andrew, we've got about 30 seconds left.
[03:57:32.298 --> 03:57:34.681]  Tell people where they can find you on Twitter and your website.
[03:57:35.846 --> 03:57:38.066]  Um, my website just shows me, uh, fighting.
[03:57:38.066 --> 03:57:39.547]  It's tatechinkai.net.
[03:57:39.547 --> 03:57:43.888]  I'm semi-retired now, but I might be coming back, and I'm on Twitter at CobraTate.
[03:57:43.888 --> 03:57:49.008]  Uh, I really am surprised by the backlash on this depression thing, but I mean everything I said.
[03:57:49.008 --> 03:57:53.489]  The only message I have is to the people who said I was saying this for attention.
[03:57:53.489 --> 03:58:02.291]  I want you to understand I mean every single word I said, um, and I'm speaking the truth, and you have the choice to agree with me and be a winner in life, or you can make excuses and lose.
[03:58:02.291 --> 03:58:03.111]  It's completely up to you.
[03:58:04.495 --> 03:58:10.520]  All right, we really appreciate you joining us today, Andrew, and I'm sure the reaction will be triggered, to say the least.
[03:58:10.520 --> 03:58:12.641]  Andrew, thanks for joining us today.
[03:58:12.641 --> 03:58:14.162]  Thank you for having me.
[03:58:14.162 --> 03:58:20.427]  There goes Andrew Tate, world champion kickboxer, and that is what they're not telling you about depression.
[03:58:20.427 --> 03:58:24.890]  Again, very controversial subject, but at least we can talk about it.
[03:58:24.890 --> 03:58:27.492]  We can have a rational conversation without going insane.
[03:58:27.492 --> 03:58:28.693]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[03:58:28.693 --> 03:58:29.534]  Inforwars.com.
[03:58:31.440 --> 03:58:35.432]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
