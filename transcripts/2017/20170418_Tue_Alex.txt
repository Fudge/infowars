[00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:08.665]  Well here we are.
[00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:09.525]  It's Tuesday.
[00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:12.828]  Already the 18th day of April 2017.
[00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.712]  I'm Alex Jones here in studio.
[00:00:17.772 --> 00:00:23.918]  David Knight and many others are coming up with breaking news as well as guests with us here in studio today.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.321]  Look at the headlines.
[00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:28.022]  All out war.
[00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:37.129]  North Korea warns nuclear war could break out at any moment as country vows to test more missiles this week after one failed last Sunday.
[00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.675]  North Korea will test missiles weekly, senior official tells the British broadcasting company.
[00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:45.116]  U.S.
[00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:48.378]  deploys two more aircraft carriers towards Korean Peninsula.
[00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:49.399]  That from Zero Hedge.
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.481]  We have the article posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:00:53.427 --> 00:00:55.548]  That is a huge, massive movement.
[00:00:56.768 --> 00:00:59.689]  Pentagon starts review of nuclear posture.
[00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.350]  Ordered by Trump.
[00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:06.872]  North Korea all-out war if U.S.
[00:01:07.392 --> 00:01:08.873]  uses military action.
[00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:09.993]  High nuke threat.
[00:01:10.013 --> 00:01:11.694]  North Korea threatens missile launch.
[00:01:13.455 --> 00:01:16.156]  And now we have Russian state-run media
[00:01:17.256 --> 00:01:23.383]  Coming out, that means officially from the government, saying Donald Trump is more dangerous than North Korea.
[00:01:23.403 --> 00:01:27.248]  Well, technically, that's absolutely true.
[00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.474]  Now, the media is going to say, Jones agrees Trump is worse than North Korea.
[00:01:32.534 --> 00:01:32.754]  No.
[00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:35.317]  I mean, scientific about this.
[00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:37.720]  Who has 50,000 nuclear weapons?
[00:01:39.127 --> 00:01:40.909]  Who has 15 aircraft carriers?
[00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.052]  Who has over 1,000 Predator drones alone?
[00:01:44.252 --> 00:01:44.913]  On and on and on.
[00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:45.954]  The biggest military in the world.
[00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:48.437]  55% of military budget globally.
[00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:53.562]  Of course, technically, an elephant is more dangerous than a rat.
[00:01:56.616 --> 00:02:15.370]  The difference is North Korea is the one firing missiles off the coast of Japan, constantly grabbing fishing boats, constantly shooting artillery over at islands, constantly going after people, constantly threatening to nuke Tokyo, Japan, and constantly threatening to nuke South Korea's capital, Seoul.
[00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:19.793]  So technically, Trump is more dangerous.
[00:02:19.913 --> 00:02:23.536]  America has bigger teeth, but America is not starting it.
[00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.718]  But I also understand Russia's statement here.
[00:02:30.288 --> 00:02:44.566]  It is scary overall to have North Korea in this position and to have Trump call their bluff because we've had this strategy of appeasement, the strategy of giving them nuclear reactors, the strategy of going along with them for decades.
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.021]  Really since 1953, and it's a joke!
[00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:54.302]  And now China has bought into that posture and has grabbed 90% of the South China Sea.
[00:02:54.322 --> 00:03:04.804]  In fact, we could probably play over this clip right now, the CNN layout, where they actually show you accurately that 90% has been grabbed by China from Japan all the way down to the Philippines.
[00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:06.344]  Thousands and thousands of square miles.
[00:03:07.424 --> 00:03:08.785]  More than they ever had.
[00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:10.445]  It's a very belligerent posture.
[00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:14.686]  So bottom line, Trump is letting China know we're not going to be pushed around.
[00:03:16.817 --> 00:03:28.305]  But North Korea is so psychotic that they didn't launch a missile or detonate an atomic weapon like they promised to do on their Founders Day from the grandpa, you know, first dictator of North Korea.
[00:03:28.985 --> 00:03:29.986]  So they didn't detonate that on the 15th.
[00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:32.327]  I thought, oh, wow, North Korea blinked.
[00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:33.508]  Maybe they're going to be sane.
[00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:36.470]  Maybe they can open up the free trade like East Germany did.
[00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.611]  Maybe we can end all this.
[00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:46.597]  And then as I'm shooting the video, Saturday night, it was already the 16th in North Korea, already halfway to the 16th, I saw the text coming in.
[00:03:47.137 --> 00:03:48.959]  Alex, they just tested a missile.
[00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:49.600]  You're wrong.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.200]  Fake news.
[00:03:50.481 --> 00:03:51.501]  How am I supposed to know?
[00:03:51.562 --> 00:03:52.863]  They don't fire it on the 15th.
[00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:53.984]  It's on the 16th.
[00:03:54.204 --> 00:03:56.346]  I say, wow, they blinked, which they did.
[00:03:57.047 --> 00:03:59.649]  And then they supposedly test one and it blows up on the launch pad.
[00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.931]  That was happening live.
[00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:02.012]  So I was correct.
[00:04:02.052 --> 00:04:03.113]  They did blink on the 15th.
[00:04:03.453 --> 00:04:04.394]  They didn't test the nuke.
[00:04:04.434 --> 00:04:05.135]  That's another blink.
[00:04:05.215 --> 00:04:07.117]  But now they say they're not.
[00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:11.688]  And so I'm just trying to have some positive, you know, news here.
[00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:15.430]  It's mainstream media saying, end of the world, nuclear war imminent.
[00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.011]  Oh my gosh, get ready for it, all the rest of it.
[00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:22.613]  So we're going to really focus on Korea and the situation today.
[00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:24.133]  I know David Knight's an expert on it.
[00:04:24.174 --> 00:04:25.054]  He's done a lot of research.
[00:04:25.094 --> 00:04:25.994]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:04:26.655 --> 00:04:28.335]  And we've got so much more to break down.
[00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:29.956]  I'm going to go over more of this when we come back.
[00:04:30.256 --> 00:04:32.297]  What these two new aircraft carrier groups mean.
[00:04:34.517 --> 00:04:36.738]  But the big thing is, let's pray to God for peace.
[00:04:36.798 --> 00:04:48.986]  Let's pray for the whole world to come together, that North Korea be freed, that the United States not be played by the globalists into conflict with Russia, that we not back radical jihadist Islam, and that humanity basically come back from the brink.
[00:04:49.226 --> 00:04:51.467]  We'll be back with so much more news on the other side.
[00:04:51.487 --> 00:04:54.809]  InfoWars.com, we've got big breaking news on that front.
[00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:55.289]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:03.090]  You have no money?
[00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.311]  This is okay, we will take your blood.
[00:05:05.592 --> 00:05:10.935]  If you want access to the Vatican Museums, cash, visa, MasterCard or needle is accepted.
[00:05:11.236 --> 00:05:14.598]  That's right, you can give blood to access the Vatican Museums.
[00:05:14.838 --> 00:05:19.301]  The blood payment plan has a slogan, give blood and follow your artistic inclination.
[00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:22.884]  Blood donors then receive a voucher which gives them access to the museums.
[00:05:23.244 --> 00:05:26.867]  The director of the Vatican Museums said, without blood there is no life.
[00:05:27.347 --> 00:05:29.788]  Without art, life would be empty and sad.
[00:05:30.508 --> 00:05:32.188]  Okay, I love Jesus too.
[00:05:32.288 --> 00:05:32.968]  Happy Easter!
[00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:34.889]  I guess this is a good idea.
[00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:37.970]  Get some blood donations and allow people access to history.
[00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.930]  Sounds harmless.
[00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.610]  But wait!
[00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.551]  Each blood donation is good for a 4 euro voucher.
[00:05:42.951 --> 00:05:45.331]  It costs 16 euros to access the museums.
[00:05:46.051 --> 00:05:49.192]  So you have to donate blood four times before you can even get in.
[00:05:49.772 --> 00:05:52.353]  By the time you've given enough blood, you'd have fainted.
[00:05:53.174 --> 00:05:57.221]  Enjoy Michelangelo's Last Judgment as you recover from hypovolemia.
[00:05:57.742 --> 00:05:59.987]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:09.468]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:19.590]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption, and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.871]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:26.912]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:06:26.932 --> 00:06:28.432]  We now have George Soros.
[00:06:29.552 --> 00:06:30.292]  As a goblin.
[00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:36.755]  On the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:06:37.495 --> 00:06:41.857]  It says, deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[00:06:44.098 --> 00:06:51.201]  So, it is a limited edition, deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[00:06:51.541 --> 00:06:53.182]  It's powerful, I hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:07:58.299 --> 00:07:58.799]  I hurt myself today
[00:08:19.725 --> 00:08:22.427]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[00:08:22.487 --> 00:08:24.128]  I'm David Knight on this Tuesday, April 18, 2017.
[00:08:25.049 --> 00:08:29.012]  Maybe that's an appropriate song to play on election day.
[00:08:29.712 --> 00:08:30.953]  I've hurt myself today.
[00:08:31.193 --> 00:08:33.495]  It's kind of self-inflicted wounds, isn't it, most of the time.
[00:08:33.535 --> 00:08:35.796]  We've got a couple of elections that are in the news.
[00:08:35.836 --> 00:08:39.919]  Of course, Theresa May has called a snap election coming up in June.
[00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:41.821]  She's trying to consolidate support.
[00:08:42.481 --> 00:08:50.788]  To move forward with Brexit, we also have a special election that is taking place in Georgia today that is getting a lot of national press.
[00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:55.752]  It has become a cause celeb for the left to move against Donald Trump.
[00:08:55.772 --> 00:09:03.799]  We're going to talk about that as well as some information about the election in France and an update on Turkey.
[00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:08.323]  Before we get to all of that and before we get to what's happening in North Korea, there's also been some
[00:09:08.963 --> 00:09:09.384]  We're good to go.
[00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:34.984]  25% off vitamin mineral fusion.
[00:09:35.004 --> 00:09:39.148]  25% off our vitamin B12 liquid supplement that you just put under your tongue.
[00:09:39.388 --> 00:09:43.792]  Has the same effect as what you would get with a vitamin B12 injection with a needle.
[00:09:43.853 --> 00:09:45.454]  No, you can just do it under your tongue.
[00:09:45.914 --> 00:09:48.657]  Our secret 12, that's vitamin B12, that's 25% off.
[00:09:49.157 --> 00:09:52.661]  Also, survival shield X2, nascent iodine, that is 25% off.
[00:09:54.142 --> 00:10:08.189]  And this is going to possibly be our last shipment for a while when this sells out because it is getting very difficult for us to get that deep earth iodine supply that we've been using to create that.
[00:10:08.309 --> 00:10:09.369]  So get that while you can.
[00:10:09.429 --> 00:10:11.730]  It's even at a special 25% off.
[00:10:11.831 --> 00:10:15.652]  And don't forget, also, Brain Force is 30% off.
[00:10:15.712 --> 00:10:18.054]  That's, as I've pointed out many times, my favorite supplement.
[00:10:18.374 --> 00:10:20.455]  It really does help me to focus.
[00:10:21.502 --> 00:10:24.643]  Helps me to recall, and I think you'll find the same thing.
[00:10:24.683 --> 00:10:28.463]  If you give that a try, I think you will really notice a difference.
[00:10:28.483 --> 00:10:31.284]  It doesn't make you jittery like caffeine does.
[00:10:31.384 --> 00:10:35.365]  It's a very focusing natural supplement.
[00:10:35.485 --> 00:10:37.465]  That's 30% off Brain Force.
[00:10:37.505 --> 00:10:41.186]  You'll see all of that at our Easter special that is ending tonight.
[00:10:41.226 --> 00:10:42.946]  That's at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:10:43.246 --> 00:10:45.487]  There's been an update on the Facebook killer.
[00:10:45.867 --> 00:10:46.707]  You may have seen this.
[00:10:47.007 --> 00:10:47.427]  He just
[00:10:48.287 --> 00:10:51.949]  Killed himself, committed suicide in Erie, Pennsylvania after a chase.
[00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.471]  And of course he committed this live murder in Cleveland.
[00:10:55.552 --> 00:10:57.413]  It's been a nationwide manhunt for him.
[00:10:58.233 --> 00:11:00.695]  And he just committed suicide.
[00:11:00.855 --> 00:11:06.058]  And I think as I look at this, and we look at all the press attention that was given to this Facebook killer.
[00:11:06.898 --> 00:11:11.521]  You know there was an article last week, and I covered it, and of course it was out of the UK, and Drudge Report had it.
[00:11:12.799 --> 00:11:14.280]  But nobody really talked about this.
[00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:17.623]  Everybody was talking about the Facebook killer, and yes, it was outrageous.
[00:11:17.703 --> 00:11:18.143]  It was really...
[00:11:19.815 --> 00:11:21.496]  Really disgusting and outrageous.
[00:11:21.536 --> 00:11:26.139]  But there was some other Facebook stuff that was really disgusting and outrageous that didn't get a lot of press coverage.
[00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:29.942]  And perhaps it was because it involved Facebook itself.
[00:11:30.462 --> 00:11:34.025]  You know, anybody can put up a live stream and they took the stream down when they found it.
[00:11:34.565 --> 00:11:44.132]  But in the UK, they have a lot of problems because the British government, I'm going to report this again because other people really haven't picked up on this, the British government
[00:11:45.026 --> 00:11:46.447]  Facebook is taking them to task.
[00:11:46.527 --> 00:11:48.668]  They say they risk criminal prosecution.
[00:11:48.689 --> 00:11:49.829]  Let me repeat that.
[00:11:50.250 --> 00:12:03.999]  Facebook risks criminal prosecution according to the British government because they refuse to remove potentially illegal terrorist and child pornography content despite being told it was on their site.
[00:12:04.379 --> 00:12:04.920]  Do you understand?
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.960]  People found this information.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:12.282]  They had a violent pedophile cartoon, a video of an apparent sexual assault on a child.
[00:12:12.682 --> 00:12:18.083]  They had propaganda posters that were glorifying recent terrorist attacks in London and in Egypt.
[00:12:18.163 --> 00:12:23.704]  Remember, there wasn't much talk, was there, about the attacks on the Christian churches in Egypt.
[00:12:23.744 --> 00:12:26.185]  We didn't see those people dying slow deaths.
[00:12:26.205 --> 00:12:29.205]  We didn't see the people who were run down by ISIS terrorists with trucks.
[00:12:29.225 --> 00:12:31.546]  We didn't see them dying slow deaths because that wasn't
[00:12:32.066 --> 00:12:42.233]  Something that was going to be used for a political purpose, but boy if you have an attack in one place It's gonna get a lot of attention and they're not going to blur out the faces.
[00:12:42.333 --> 00:12:58.665]  They're not going to censor the pictures No, they will show you in slow motion the people who are dying because they want to use that politically but in this particular situation Facebook had these this sexual assault on a child these propaganda posters for terrorist attacks and they were told that
[00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:13.454]  And the British government said, look, if you are told about this, and you don't take it down, your moderators are told, you hire these people to be moderators, and you don't take that down, you own that.
[00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:14.894]  You own that.
[00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:17.175]  Now you have criminal liability.
[00:13:18.235 --> 00:13:24.077]  And I think it's interesting as we look at what broke yesterday, Mike Cernovich looking at this
[00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:31.116]  Uh, this document that we saw from a, uh, Google putting this out.
[00:13:31.136 --> 00:13:36.699]  We see today, Business Insider, Google is trying to distance themselves saying that it was a rogue vendor.
[00:13:37.139 --> 00:13:37.739]  It wasn't them.
[00:13:38.439 --> 00:13:43.842]  Ah, but they are the ones who are setting themselves up as the arbiters of truth.
[00:13:44.342 --> 00:13:47.663]  They are the ones who are taking down controversial content on YouTube.
[00:13:47.683 --> 00:13:48.004]  Stay with us.
[00:13:48.024 --> 00:13:50.665]  We're going to break that down for you when we come back, as well as North Korea.
[00:13:51.886 --> 00:13:54.630]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14:01.653 --> 00:14:10.180]  On Sunday, Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones broke the news that Google contractors are being directed to rate InfoWars articles to push them even further down in search engine results.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.122]  And liberals came out of the woodwork to say we were lying.
[00:14:13.443 --> 00:14:14.924]  Well now we have Business Insider.
[00:14:15.084 --> 00:14:21.429]  Google says rogue vendor violated guidelines by instructing contractors to rate InfoWars as untrustworthy site.
[00:14:21.609 --> 00:14:28.074]  Google said that the vendor had mistakenly told staffers working for the search engine that InfoWars should be ranked as a low-quality site.
[00:14:28.255 --> 00:14:28.555]  Oh yeah.
[00:14:28.795 --> 00:14:29.695]  We believe you, Google.
[00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:30.496]  We believe you.
[00:14:30.696 --> 00:14:38.918]  Google reps are attempting to distance themselves from the contractor's instructions by saying it does not instruct quality rangers on how to grade specific websites.
[00:14:39.138 --> 00:14:41.779]  Let's read what the contractor said in their bonus example.
[00:14:41.999 --> 00:14:46.681]  While CNN isn't a perfect news outlet, it is a popular news source that covers stories with depth to compare.
[00:14:46.861 --> 00:14:50.622]  The InfoWars article is brief and only mentions statements from sources not typical.
[00:14:50.962 --> 00:14:57.526]  Of course, they're talking about the recent Syrian chemical attack that we're saying is a false flag and is now being proven in spades.
[00:14:57.786 --> 00:15:01.008]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:09.373]  InfoWars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:15:09.613 --> 00:15:16.017]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:15:16.257 --> 00:15:20.420]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:30.432]  that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor, using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[00:15:30.673 --> 00:15:33.576]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:15:33.837 --> 00:15:39.584]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:15:39.904 --> 00:15:40.365]  It works.
[00:15:40.665 --> 00:15:48.972]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:15:48.992 --> 00:15:58.519]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.380]  A total 360 win.
[00:16:01.508 --> 00:16:10.531]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:16:10.591 --> 00:16:18.694]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:16:18.994 --> 00:16:23.676]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:16:23.876 --> 00:16:30.599]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:16:30.659 --> 00:16:37.741]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:16:37.841 --> 00:16:44.704]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:16:44.864 --> 00:16:49.206]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:16:49.346 --> 00:16:52.608]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:16:52.728 --> 00:16:58.851]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:00.711]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:17:08.758 --> 00:17:15.383]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:17:15.783 --> 00:17:18.705]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[00:17:19.506 --> 00:17:30.293]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are watching or listening to the Alex Jones Show, the number one enemy of the globalists, the most attacked platform out there now.
[00:17:30.714 --> 00:17:37.018]  Thank you all for your prayers, thank you for your support, thank you for spreading the articles and videos, because we're all in this together.
[00:17:37.078 --> 00:17:38.139]  The mainstream corporate
[00:17:38.439 --> 00:17:39.460]  Press is collapsing.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.361]  They're dead already.
[00:17:40.661 --> 00:17:41.462]  They know they are.
[00:17:41.862 --> 00:17:43.643]  So they're trying to get free speech banned.
[00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:46.666]  They're trying to basically push for free speech to be shut down.
[00:17:47.046 --> 00:17:53.011]  They're even openly pushing for people to be arrested for their free speech, to have their children taken for free speech in America.
[00:17:53.552 --> 00:17:54.432]  They're even openly...
[00:17:55.353 --> 00:18:03.942]  Calling for massive censorship, and we have seen Google come out yesterday, Business Insider and others, got a hand of Business Insider, they actually reached out to Google.
[00:18:04.263 --> 00:18:05.564]  The other media said I was lying.
[00:18:06.325 --> 00:18:14.474]  We got the documents that we are being censored, we are being targeted for our free speech, and for exposing the Syria war as a false flag.
[00:18:14.934 --> 00:18:16.316]  By the rebels, not by Trump!
[00:18:16.676 --> 00:18:21.677]  I want to explain, I know why Trump hit the chemical depot, because he would look bad if he didn't, and he couldn't confirm either way.
[00:18:21.717 --> 00:18:25.318]  But we have the intel, we have the history, there should be an investigation of the rebels.
[00:18:25.678 --> 00:18:29.999]  And so the neocon group, with the contract out, the word is it's a $10 million contract.
[00:18:30.019 --> 00:18:31.780]  We broke that, of course, with Cernovich last week.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:38.562]  And Cernovich got this document that Google confirmed is their internal document, where they were ordering people to censor us.
[00:18:38.582 --> 00:18:42.062]  They say it wasn't being done quite right now, so they're going to stop.
[00:18:42.803 --> 00:18:44.063]  No, they're not stopping.
[00:18:44.443 --> 00:18:46.806]  Get InfoWars.com out to everybody you know.
[00:18:47.747 --> 00:18:48.428]  Spread the links.
[00:18:48.788 --> 00:18:53.834]  Because you're not going to get hardcore, unfiltered, teleprompter-free information like this anywhere else.
[00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:57.218]  Now we've got to end the Easter Mega Special here in the next 48 hours.
[00:18:57.538 --> 00:18:58.540]  But people love sales.
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.260]  I love sales.
[00:19:00.629 --> 00:19:04.492]  And it helps fund our operation, at least if a lot of people take advantage of the sale, then it does.
[00:19:05.533 --> 00:19:11.878]  If we have a big sale and cut prices down to almost no profit, and then people don't take advantage of it, then we actually lose money.
[00:19:12.138 --> 00:19:14.940]  We need to fund ourselves, fund this operation.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.022]  30% off BrainForce, the great nootropic.
[00:19:17.062 --> 00:19:17.702]  Try it, folks.
[00:19:17.982 --> 00:19:18.883]  It supports the broadcast.
[00:19:18.923 --> 00:19:19.523]  You can't lose.
[00:19:19.543 --> 00:19:21.645]  25% off Supramel Vitality.
[00:19:21.805 --> 00:19:23.046]  25% off Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:19:23.206 --> 00:19:24.127]  25% off Secret.
[00:19:24.147 --> 00:19:25.708]  12% off Vitamin B12.
[00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:33.954]  25% off Super Female Vitality, 25% off Survival Shield X2, and many others at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:19:34.595 --> 00:19:47.944]  We've also got it in the special on 40% off on the amazing Nomad Pro Pure Gravity Fed Stainless Steel System at 120-something bucks, leading competitors 250 for the same basic unit.
[00:19:48.084 --> 00:19:49.285]  You cannot beat that deal.
[00:19:50.506 --> 00:19:51.207]  We're good to go.
[00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:19.481]  Just like our information is game-changing and tip-of-the-spear, our products are absolutely game-changing because we want you to come back and buy them because they work good, and we know we're targets of the globalists, so we have the highest standards.
[00:20:20.021 --> 00:20:21.543]  It's a win-win-win-win-win.
[00:20:21.843 --> 00:20:22.984]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:20:23.084 --> 00:20:24.745]  Infowarsstore.com or 888.
[00:20:25.566 --> 00:20:31.331]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, let's now hand the baton to David Knight right here in the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:20:48.322 --> 00:20:53.766]  All right, thank you, Alex, and remember that that mega Easter sale is going to end tonight.
[00:20:53.886 --> 00:20:55.387]  That's what Alex was just talking about.
[00:20:56.187 --> 00:21:01.391]  Just before the break, I was talking about how Google has now responded to the information that we revealed yesterday.
[00:21:01.411 --> 00:21:05.094]  Remember Mike Cernovich, over the weekend, had a contractor send him
[00:21:06.255 --> 00:21:10.823]  A sample of how Google is going to censor entire sites.
[00:21:10.883 --> 00:21:13.968]  And of course they used InfoWars as an example of this.
[00:21:14.348 --> 00:21:18.375]  Saying, well here's a story where Assad says he thinks that this Syrian attack was fake.
[00:21:19.255 --> 00:21:21.956]  CNN talks about it, and they're trustworthy.
[00:21:21.976 --> 00:21:24.757]  You should rate them high, because they talk to government sources.
[00:21:24.797 --> 00:21:26.338]  They talk to people from the Pentagon.
[00:21:26.358 --> 00:21:27.819]  They talk to bankers, okay?
[00:21:28.219 --> 00:21:30.720]  But InfoWars talks to people like Ron Paul.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.280]  They tell you what Assad said.
[00:21:32.961 --> 00:21:44.966]  And then, yesterday, we told you that there was a guy who was an MIT professor emeritus, a scientific advisor, former scientific advisor to the Department of Defense, who was a scientific advisor four years ago,
[00:21:45.706 --> 00:21:53.773]  And here's part of the group that took a look at the false flag back then that they were trying to say, look, this is a sarin gas attack and only the government of Syria could have done it.
[00:21:53.833 --> 00:21:55.475]  And they said, no, no, that's not true.
[00:21:55.815 --> 00:22:00.219]  They debunked that four years ago before there was any kind of military action.
[00:22:00.599 --> 00:22:01.019]  The U.N.
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:01.580]  agreed with it.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.081]  Russia was saying that as well.
[00:22:03.121 --> 00:22:04.863]  So the Russia, Russia, the U.S.
[00:22:05.103 --> 00:22:05.904]  and the U.N.
[00:22:06.084 --> 00:22:08.626]  all agreed that that was a false flag four years ago.
[00:22:08.646 --> 00:22:11.008]  Now, this story here, you can see this on Infowars.com.
[00:22:11.969 --> 00:22:16.874]  He put this up and he said, look, you can see that this was not an aerial munition.
[00:22:17.695 --> 00:22:18.736]  This was crushed.
[00:22:18.816 --> 00:22:20.338]  It did not explode from within.
[00:22:20.358 --> 00:22:22.440]  It was crushed and that created the crater.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:29.047]  So he says the very photo that the Pentagon is putting out here shows that their narrative is not true.
[00:22:29.727 --> 00:22:33.531]  He said this is amateurish and it is politicized.
[00:22:34.292 --> 00:22:35.412]  But, here's the other thing.
[00:22:35.512 --> 00:22:36.833]  They used that as an example.
[00:22:36.913 --> 00:22:39.494]  That was the example, that story, that went out on Friday.
[00:22:40.094 --> 00:22:44.075]  They used that as an example over the weekend and we immediately found out about it through Mike Cernovich.
[00:22:44.095 --> 00:22:45.036]  We put that up yesterday.
[00:22:45.056 --> 00:22:45.696]  We talked about it.
[00:22:45.756 --> 00:22:50.417]  Now, Google has come back and said, well, that was a rogue vendor.
[00:22:51.018 --> 00:22:52.638]  See, this is their Rogue One defense.
[00:22:54.239 --> 00:22:55.359]  It was a rogue vendor that did it.
[00:22:55.719 --> 00:22:56.580]  We really didn't do it.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.101]  And I've had a lot of people also push back and say, why are you saying that Google is censoring you?
[00:23:01.161 --> 00:23:02.622]  Google is a private organization.
[00:23:02.662 --> 00:23:03.682]  They can do whatever they wish.
[00:23:05.759 --> 00:23:14.561]  You have to understand that what this is, is a public-private partnership, where the government works very closely with the corporation.
[00:23:14.601 --> 00:23:16.001]  We see that with the toll roads.
[00:23:16.181 --> 00:23:19.442]  And every time you see PPP, you know you're going to get screwed.
[00:23:20.142 --> 00:23:21.202]  It's crunny capitalism.
[00:23:21.642 --> 00:23:23.343]  It's something that's being done under the table.
[00:23:23.563 --> 00:23:26.763]  And what they're doing right here, folks, is they're outsourcing censorship.
[00:23:27.563 --> 00:23:28.304]  Let me repeat that.
[00:23:28.604 --> 00:23:30.744]  They're outsourcing censorship.
[00:23:31.324 --> 00:23:32.304]  That's what this is all about.
[00:23:32.885 --> 00:23:33.785]  That's why they're using Google.
[00:23:33.825 --> 00:23:34.945]  That's why they're using Facebook.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:47.264]  You see Angela Merkel whispering in the ear of Zuckerberg about how they need his help to deal with the crisis that they have created with immigration.
[00:23:47.964 --> 00:23:49.165]  We'll work with you on that.
[00:23:49.305 --> 00:23:51.366]  We'll work with the Chinese Communist government on that.
[00:23:51.826 --> 00:23:56.968]  We'll work with anybody as long as the money keeps flowing and the monopoly keeps going.
[00:23:57.528 --> 00:24:02.710]  You have to understand that all this phony narrative about what was going on with the
[00:24:03.974 --> 00:24:10.195]  FCC, as I pointed out yesterday, it was simply a, number one, it was a competition between bureaucracies.
[00:24:10.676 --> 00:24:16.337]  You had the FTC, the Trade Commission, has been regulating the internet very lightly.
[00:24:16.797 --> 00:24:21.198]  But then the FCC said, we're going to regulate it as if it was a limited frequency spectrum.
[00:24:21.218 --> 00:24:27.339]  So we're going to do net neutrality, we're going to do these other rules, we're going to put prohibitions on ISPs.
[00:24:27.359 --> 00:24:29.460]  When they wanted to put prohibition on ISPs,
[00:24:31.113 --> 00:24:37.158]  And that was for the benefit of Google and Facebook, who are heavily connected to the Obama administration.
[00:24:37.878 --> 00:24:41.341]  How many times has Eric Schmidt by himself go to the Obama administration?
[00:24:41.461 --> 00:24:44.483]  It was over 200 times that he went to meet with Obama.
[00:24:44.804 --> 00:24:49.667]  So what they're doing is they're saying, well, we're going to allow Facebook and Google to collect your information.
[00:24:49.928 --> 00:24:51.569]  They're even going to turn it over to employers.
[00:24:51.589 --> 00:24:53.771]  They're going to turn over your browsing history.
[00:24:53.791 --> 00:24:57.513]  They're going to turn over the history of the videos that you watched on YouTube.
[00:24:57.554 --> 00:24:58.975]  They'll turn that over to the government.
[00:24:58.995 --> 00:25:00.396]  Remember that broke a couple of days ago?
[00:25:01.246 --> 00:25:05.990]  They'll turn over all that stuff, they'll monetize all that stuff, and they'll also turn over information to the government.
[00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.391]  See, that's what the government wants to have.
[00:25:08.171 --> 00:25:09.592]  The government wants to know what you think.
[00:25:10.332 --> 00:25:12.233]  Are their narratives working with you?
[00:25:12.773 --> 00:25:14.914]  Do they need to fine-tune it over here?
[00:25:14.954 --> 00:25:18.175]  Will it be more acceptable if they fine-tune the narrative?
[00:25:18.195 --> 00:25:19.035]  Will you believe them then?
[00:25:19.055 --> 00:25:19.135]  Okay?
[00:25:20.035 --> 00:25:21.236]  It's kind of like, get smart.
[00:25:21.596 --> 00:25:22.716]  You know, would you believe?
[00:25:23.037 --> 00:25:26.298]  And then he puts this thing out and then it's like, it's absolutely incredible.
[00:25:26.338 --> 00:25:28.339]  He goes, well, would you believe if I said this?
[00:25:28.439 --> 00:25:29.539]  Okay, that's what they're playing.
[00:25:29.579 --> 00:25:35.781]  It's this closed-loop game where they throw out a phony narrative and then they measure to see whether or not people are buying it or not.
[00:25:35.821 --> 00:25:37.122]  That's the kind of intelligence
[00:25:37.802 --> 00:25:40.546]  That Facebook and Google can help the government with.
[00:25:40.587 --> 00:25:48.820]  And then the government helps them by giving them monopolies, saying we're not going to let ISPs collect this information, we're going to let you and Facebook collect this information.
[00:25:49.441 --> 00:25:50.582]  So they come out and they say...
[00:25:51.929 --> 00:25:52.890]  This is a vendor who did it.
[00:25:52.950 --> 00:26:08.309]  And before I leave this whole idea of it being private, let me say that a lot of these people who are defending Google are the same people who said we need to shut down a small local bakery if they don't bake a cake for a gay wedding because it's against their religion.
[00:26:09.175 --> 00:26:11.578]  Now you have the freedom, you can go to any bakery, right?
[00:26:12.379 --> 00:26:14.281]  But Google has a virtual monopoly.
[00:26:14.321 --> 00:26:15.622]  They operate in the public space.
[00:26:15.722 --> 00:26:25.293]  The arguments that they made to shut down this bakery, saying that they are a business operating in the public space, so they don't have the right to choose to refuse service to people.
[00:26:26.635 --> 00:26:29.497]  They're not making that same argument for Google now, are they?
[00:26:29.798 --> 00:26:30.819]  Isn't that kind of interesting?
[00:26:31.139 --> 00:26:37.265]  Google gets a pass, but the little tiny local bakery gets hammered, put out of business for that same type of wedding.
[00:26:37.285 --> 00:26:41.108]  So don't talk to me about the fact that they're private, okay?
[00:26:41.568 --> 00:26:42.389]  I'm fine with that.
[00:26:42.429 --> 00:26:44.171]  Let's have some boycotts of them, that's fine.
[00:26:45.592 --> 00:26:53.557]  Realize that you're not going to be able to, it's much easier to start up a bakery than it is to go into competition with Google or Facebook.
[00:26:53.657 --> 00:26:54.938]  You realize that of course, don't you?
[00:26:55.638 --> 00:27:06.686]  And you realize how powerful they are in terms of shaping the narrative, in terms of shutting down the First Amendment and shutting down specific sites because our government wants to outsource.
[00:27:07.722 --> 00:27:12.607]  Outsource censorship, just like they want to outsource their espionage on you.
[00:27:12.807 --> 00:27:22.496]  See, when these people collect the information on you, and they turn it over to the government, the government just passed a law last year, CISA, they've been trying to get that for a long time, they finally got it through.
[00:27:22.956 --> 00:27:30.504]  They said you can't sue them if they turn information that they collected about you over to the government, because they said, well, that belongs to them now.
[00:27:30.964 --> 00:27:32.465]  That's the fiction that they play.
[00:27:33.186 --> 00:27:35.168]  So they outsource the surveillance.
[00:27:35.568 --> 00:27:38.170]  They outsource the censorship.
[00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.313]  This is the game that they're playing with this public-private partnership.
[00:27:42.593 --> 00:27:43.954]  Now this is what Google said today.
[00:27:43.994 --> 00:27:49.699]  In this article they said, Google's representative distanced the company from the contractor's instructions.
[00:27:50.339 --> 00:27:54.483]  This is the documents that we exposed yesterday on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:55.143 --> 00:28:05.187]  They told Business Insider that it did not instruct quality raters how to grade specific websites, but it gives general rules to get unbiased feedback to improve the algorithm.
[00:28:05.708 --> 00:28:08.009]  Alright, let's focus on that phrase there.
[00:28:08.769 --> 00:28:11.030]  Grading specific websites.
[00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.351]  Understand that it would be bad enough
[00:28:14.557 --> 00:28:18.059]  If they were to come out and say, we're going to tell you what's true and what isn't.
[00:28:18.119 --> 00:28:22.442]  We're going to say this story here is true and that story over there is false.
[00:28:22.642 --> 00:28:23.763]  I don't need Google.
[00:28:23.883 --> 00:28:26.385]  You don't need Google to tell you that something is true or false.
[00:28:26.405 --> 00:28:27.926]  You don't need Snopes either.
[00:28:28.546 --> 00:28:31.468]  Or this phony organization down in St.
[00:28:31.508 --> 00:28:36.632]  Petersburg that they picked up that's not much better than a couple of people with cats on this couch, okay?
[00:28:36.972 --> 00:28:38.313]  It's a very tiny little school.
[00:28:38.333 --> 00:28:39.574]  They say it's a journalism school.
[00:28:39.654 --> 00:28:42.716]  It's got a faculty of like five or six people and they hold seminars.
[00:28:43.036 --> 00:28:43.937]  They have fake
[00:28:44.717 --> 00:28:51.348]  People who are who are validating and setting on top of this news and telling you whether it's real or not.
[00:28:51.368 --> 00:28:52.189]  You don't need that.
[00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:59.400]  This is simply an effort to manipulate the narrative, to manipulate what people have out there in the public.
[00:29:00.021 --> 00:29:00.941]  But they go beyond that.
[00:29:01.001 --> 00:29:03.722]  It wouldn't be bad enough if they did that story by story, but they go beyond that.
[00:29:03.903 --> 00:29:07.424]  They point out that they're going to downrate specific websites.
[00:29:07.484 --> 00:29:18.428]  And when you look at that story, it's not just the fact that they're focused on InfoWars, but the fact that they say, well, based on the reputation of a particular site, you should always downrate their stuff to the lowest level.
[00:29:18.988 --> 00:29:21.689]  And because CNN is stellar, yeah, right?
[00:29:21.749 --> 00:29:27.651]  These people who faked everything from missile attacks and, you know, you've seen the disappearing nose of
[00:29:29.817 --> 00:29:31.098]  Of the anchor Anderson Cooper.
[00:29:31.138 --> 00:29:31.919]  I mean, come on.
[00:29:32.319 --> 00:29:33.760]  But they're the highest quality level.
[00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.241]  Because they're all in this together.
[00:29:35.782 --> 00:29:38.204]  They're part of Operation Mockingbird.
[00:29:38.704 --> 00:29:39.805]  Part 2, I guess.
[00:29:39.865 --> 00:29:40.746]  Or maybe this is part 13.
[00:29:40.866 --> 00:29:45.730]  I don't know how many different revisions we've got of Operation Mockingbird.
[00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.252]  Well, the CIA went in and said, we're going to take over the media.
[00:29:48.272 --> 00:29:50.373]  We're going to tell them what to tell the public.
[00:29:50.413 --> 00:29:52.535]  And they all read off the same government script.
[00:29:52.575 --> 00:29:53.336]  Well, CNN?
[00:29:54.056 --> 00:29:57.097]  Google, Facebook, they're all reading off the same script, but they get the high ratings.
[00:29:57.578 --> 00:30:00.319]  They are the ones who will determine what your reputation is.
[00:30:00.379 --> 00:30:04.261]  They are the ones who will determine whether what you say is true or not.
[00:30:04.701 --> 00:30:07.002]  And that was the most dangerous part about this.
[00:30:07.022 --> 00:30:10.484]  You know, we're going to have in the next hour, Lee Strahan is going to be with us.
[00:30:11.144 --> 00:30:12.525]  And he's spoken a great deal.
[00:30:13.445 --> 00:30:17.546]  About how you don't disrate something because of the source.
[00:30:17.566 --> 00:30:20.007]  You don't want to completely shut down a source.
[00:30:20.287 --> 00:30:22.467]  Even CNN can have some truth sometimes.
[00:30:23.007 --> 00:30:24.027]  Even the New York Times.
[00:30:24.868 --> 00:30:33.050]  As a matter of fact, yesterday, I covered this story that the New York Times had about MS-13 and the gang violence on Long Island.
[00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:39.091]  I talked about how that was a personal story because my wife is from that area.
[00:30:40.439 --> 00:30:55.739]  And I was absolutely amazed that even though they got the facts right, and they talked about all the murders of teenagers in that area, people who were hacked to death with machetes, and then they call these people undocumented immigrants.
[00:30:56.784 --> 00:30:58.225]  These MS-13 gang members.
[00:30:58.665 --> 00:31:02.366]  They said 10 of the 13 that were arrested were undocumented immigrants.
[00:31:02.867 --> 00:31:06.328]  They weren't criminals, they weren't gang members, they were undocumented immigrants.
[00:31:06.408 --> 00:31:08.229]  Meet your new immigrant neighbors.
[00:31:08.769 --> 00:31:10.030]  They just happen to be undocumented.
[00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:11.450]  We're working on that documentation.
[00:31:12.051 --> 00:31:19.394]  Understand that, you know, today Donald Trump came out blasting them, blasting Obama for creating it, and he was absolutely right.
[00:31:19.994 --> 00:31:25.757]  No, you know, MS-13 was not created by Obama, but Obama opened the gates wide open for them.
[00:31:26.477 --> 00:31:27.358]  Open the gates wide open.
[00:31:28.419 --> 00:31:44.513]  And so when we look at this and we understand that right after the election, do you remember there was a California amnesty group that said we want to block the state of California from turning over lists of gang members to immigration because we don't want them deported.
[00:31:45.762 --> 00:31:49.806]  They might get somebody who is falsely identified as a gang member.
[00:31:49.906 --> 00:31:51.868]  So we don't want any gang members deported.
[00:31:52.569 --> 00:31:54.131]  That's the way California reacted to that.
[00:31:54.651 --> 00:32:02.920]  So today Donald Trump said, the weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama administration allowed bad MS-13 gangs to form in cities across the U.S.
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.361]  We're removing them quickly.
[00:32:07.293 --> 00:32:13.536]  At the same time, we had Judge Napolitano say, you know, it should be newsworthy that the government is enforcing immigration law.
[00:32:13.836 --> 00:32:16.538]  And he quoted the current Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.
[00:32:16.558 --> 00:32:19.880]  He said, understand there's two types of illegal immigrants.
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:26.063]  He said either they committed a crime here and they went to jail or they've committed a crime and they didn't yet go to jail.
[00:32:27.654 --> 00:32:28.836]  Oh, that sounds kind of harsh, doesn't it?
[00:32:29.296 --> 00:32:34.903]  Understand that what we're talking about here are foreign citizens who are criminally trespassing.
[00:32:35.483 --> 00:32:38.327]  And usually what they're doing is committing identity fraud.
[00:32:38.387 --> 00:32:40.710]  Many times they steal other people's identities.
[00:32:41.522 --> 00:32:46.726]  And that's even if they don't, quote-unquote, commit a crime, like hacking somebody to death with a machete.
[00:32:46.746 --> 00:32:52.330]  And the people who were being hacked to death were Hispanic teenagers, who were trying to flee this violence, but they couldn't.
[00:32:53.011 --> 00:32:57.094]  Because we don't have a process that vets people coming into this country.
[00:32:57.534 --> 00:32:58.355]  It's just a free-for-all.
[00:32:58.755 --> 00:32:59.776]  Who can make it across the border?
[00:32:59.796 --> 00:33:00.316]  Well, guess what?
[00:33:00.696 --> 00:33:05.420]  If you can make it across the border as a peaceful citizen, you can make it across the border if you're a gang member.
[00:33:06.502 --> 00:33:07.582]  And so that's the situation we have.
[00:33:07.602 --> 00:33:15.144]  So, Judge Napolitano says, well, that shouldn't be newsworthy, but he goes, actually it is, because we've got a government that, in general, is enforcing the law.
[00:33:15.564 --> 00:33:29.428]  And then we find out, story from Breitbart, that Breitbart, Texas, found out that there's 60 linear miles of the border where one of the supervisors is saying, we're not going to send any agents to that area.
[00:33:30.285 --> 00:33:31.345]  We're not going to put anybody there.
[00:33:31.605 --> 00:33:35.326]  And the supervisor is somebody from the Obama era.
[00:33:36.207 --> 00:33:40.208]  This is a guy who is a holdover from the Obama administration.
[00:33:40.968 --> 00:33:49.171]  And once the Border Patrol president, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, Brandon Judd, found out about this, he was appalled.
[00:33:49.211 --> 00:33:50.531]  He verified this to Breitbart.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:58.285]  They went on to say, one of the Border Patrol agents said, criminal cartels are exploiting our weaknesses on a daily basis.
[00:33:58.706 --> 00:34:03.069]  They're certainly going to exploit such a large area of an open and unpatrolled border.
[00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:12.196]  So they said this is, part of this is corruption, perhaps, because we've got people who are hanging back, not putting anybody there so they can leave it open for the drug cartels to come through.
[00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:15.299]  But the other part of it is a holdover from the Obama era.
[00:34:16.399 --> 00:34:18.221]  So that's the two different aspects of that.
[00:34:18.874 --> 00:34:19.914]  I got off on that tangent.
[00:34:20.214 --> 00:34:23.675]  Lee Stranahan is going to be joining us in the next hour.
[00:34:24.255 --> 00:34:25.536]  He's somebody who worked at Breitbart.
[00:34:25.636 --> 00:34:26.676]  He knows Steve Bannon.
[00:34:26.696 --> 00:34:34.378]  I want to talk to him about that as well, but I also want to talk to him about singling out entire sites for censorship.
[00:34:35.078 --> 00:34:36.639]  That is the real issue here.
[00:34:37.299 --> 00:34:41.120]  And Google is trying to walk this back saying, we didn't single out InfoWars.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.681]  Understand, they're going to single us out one by one.
[00:34:45.541 --> 00:34:47.442]  That was just a sample of what's to come.
[00:34:47.862 --> 00:34:56.145]  And what they're doing, setting themselves up as the arbiter of truth, downrating and destroying individual sites, that is the mechanism that they're setting up.
[00:34:56.345 --> 00:34:59.566]  It is censorship by outsourcing.
[00:34:59.606 --> 00:35:00.226]  We'll be right back.
[00:35:11.388 --> 00:35:19.313]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:19.353 --> 00:35:21.315]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[00:35:22.075 --> 00:35:28.979]  We can easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand different products.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:35.364]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20, because we private label some, but we also develop
[00:35:36.258 --> 00:35:46.024]  Many of the products originally were some of the top labs in the country, so that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe, and they're also very affordable.
[00:35:46.044 --> 00:35:48.185]  Exactly, you talk about being a game changer, right?
[00:35:48.205 --> 00:35:59.072]  You talk about, we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders, we've both talked to them, they have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[00:35:59.412 --> 00:35:59.813]  They have
[00:36:00.693 --> 00:36:08.382]  Individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[00:36:08.762 --> 00:36:08.943]  Okay?
[00:36:09.243 --> 00:36:10.344]  We refuse to screw people.
[00:36:10.685 --> 00:36:11.666]  We refuse to do that.
[00:36:12.046 --> 00:36:14.709]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[00:36:14.789 --> 00:36:16.711]  We're producing something we want to take.
[00:36:16.811 --> 00:36:17.212]  Exactly.
[00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:18.633]  We're looking for the best.
[00:36:18.693 --> 00:36:23.555]  We went out and searched for the best to Private Label, and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[00:36:23.735 --> 00:36:27.417]  So we go to these big firms and say, we want to make the dream formula.
[00:36:27.437 --> 00:36:33.420]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:34.901]  It's everywhere.
[00:36:35.101 --> 00:36:35.761]  It's in nature.
[00:36:35.821 --> 00:36:37.822]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[00:36:38.302 --> 00:36:44.345]  Just this bottle of silica, okay, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount that's even in our product, is $35.
[00:36:45.506 --> 00:36:50.769]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[00:36:50.789 --> 00:36:51.450]  This is insane.
[00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:58.074]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, okay, I get that you guys want to do, you know, high power stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000?
[00:36:58.594 --> 00:37:00.616]  And then you could sell, you know, multiple bottles of it.
[00:37:00.656 --> 00:37:01.536]  People will buy more of it.
[00:37:01.556 --> 00:37:02.237]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[00:37:02.337 --> 00:37:02.797]  Okay.
[00:37:03.237 --> 00:37:04.118]  Compare that to this.
[00:37:04.338 --> 00:37:05.719]  This is a $50 product.
[00:37:05.739 --> 00:37:09.141]  One of the leaders in the industry has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[00:37:09.201 --> 00:37:09.281]  Okay.
[00:37:09.361 --> 00:37:09.562]  We have 10,000.
[00:37:09.602 --> 00:37:10.342]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[00:37:13.404 --> 00:37:15.245]  There's no script, there's no teleprompter, I'll just be honest with you.
[00:37:15.665 --> 00:37:20.909]  My problem is, with 20 products now, it's remembering to take them all.
[00:37:20.929 --> 00:37:24.791]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[00:37:25.212 --> 00:37:33.937]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product, my quality of life just isn't as good.
[00:37:34.017 --> 00:37:35.118]  It's changed my life.
[00:37:35.198 --> 00:37:37.439]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.641]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:42.383]  I was jogging, lifting weights, I couldn't lose the weight.
[00:37:43.283 --> 00:37:50.375]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us and it's changed my life and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[00:37:50.756 --> 00:37:51.517]  It's a win-win.
[00:37:51.998 --> 00:37:52.759]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:38:11.466 --> 00:38:18.550]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:19.330]  I'm David Knight.
[00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:21.371]  I want to get to North Korea here.
[00:38:21.411 --> 00:38:29.776]  We got the North Korean government describing this as thermonuclear war that may break out at any moment.
[00:38:30.016 --> 00:38:34.758]  Things are very tight here, folks, and we need to take a look at how we got to this situation.
[00:38:34.898 --> 00:38:36.159]  I'm not really sure how we get out of it.
[00:38:37.059 --> 00:38:39.482]  But we have a long history about how we got here.
[00:38:40.042 --> 00:38:41.864]  And we have to learn something from that.
[00:38:41.884 --> 00:38:42.945]  But we're going to take a look at that.
[00:38:43.266 --> 00:38:46.689]  What's going on with the U.S., South Korea, and Japan?
[00:38:46.769 --> 00:38:47.931]  Are they starting to talk?
[00:38:48.892 --> 00:38:53.296]  Well, there's some information that there are some backdoor meetings that are going on.
[00:38:53.317 --> 00:38:55.158]  Let's hope that this can be walked down.
[00:38:55.219 --> 00:38:58.202]  But meanwhile, North Korea keeps up the tough talk.
[00:38:58.955 --> 00:39:01.176]  They say these are aggressive war drills.
[00:39:01.236 --> 00:39:06.237]  They say their country is ready to react to any mode of war desired by the U.S.
[00:39:06.558 --> 00:39:15.841]  And again, firing missiles at other countries, saying that you're going to fire missiles at the United States, making aggressive threats, you know, that's not a problem.
[00:39:15.941 --> 00:39:22.563]  But, you know, putting people out there, putting the carrier group out there, that is a problem.
[00:39:22.623 --> 00:39:24.003]  I hope they can walk this thing down.
[00:39:24.023 --> 00:39:25.324]  But we're going to talk about
[00:39:26.761 --> 00:39:29.224]  All of that, as well as the economic aspects of that.
[00:39:29.244 --> 00:39:33.730]  Before we do, real quickly, I just want to point out that our Easter Mega Specials will be ending tonight.
[00:39:34.411 --> 00:39:39.056]  These are the specials of 25 to 30% off various products, 30% off Brain Force, also 25% off Super Male, Super Female Vitality.
[00:39:44.563 --> 00:39:49.705]  Secret 12, our Vitamin B12 formulation, our Vitamin Mineral Fusion, that's 25% off.
[00:39:50.125 --> 00:39:53.787]  I have a review here on Super Male Vitality, that's 25% off.
[00:39:53.807 --> 00:39:55.427]  This is from Guymon.
[00:39:55.547 --> 00:40:06.571]  He says, as a 42-year-old lifelong skateboarder and martial artist, I've got to say this product has made a very noticeable improvement in my overall energy levels and physical endurance in general.
[00:40:06.952 --> 00:40:09.172]  Within one week of use, it was undeniable for me.
[00:40:09.212 --> 00:40:11.573]  I will absolutely be ordering this product regularly.
[00:40:11.633 --> 00:40:12.674]  Thank you, InfoWars.
[00:40:13.434 --> 00:40:18.825]  That is 25% off and all those specials we put together for Easter will be ending tonight.
[00:40:18.885 --> 00:40:21.971]  Take a look at InfoWarsStore.com for those discounts.
[00:40:22.011 --> 00:40:24.576]  Let's go back to the North Korean story now.
[00:40:25.635 --> 00:40:30.616]  As we see the North Koreans talking about how serious this is, hopefully there is some good news.
[00:40:30.656 --> 00:40:36.578]  Sputnik is reporting that the U.S., South Korea, and Japan are convening trilateral talks on North Korean threat.
[00:40:36.618 --> 00:40:46.001]  They say the meetings will bring President Trump's administration together with Asian officials for the first time since Vice President Pence said the era of strategic patience with North Korea is over.
[00:40:46.701 --> 00:40:53.387]  The South Korean Ministry of Defense announced these meetings yesterday, so hopefully this is going to move things down.
[00:40:53.407 --> 00:41:07.039]  They also point out that from Beijing's perspective, even though nuclear chaos was not unleashed over the weekend, the Korean Peninsula remains highly sensitive, saying the same thing that the North Koreans are, and a high risk to regional and possible global security.
[00:41:07.079 --> 00:41:08.820]  That was the Chinese Foreign Minister.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.964]  He said any provocative action could pour oil on the fire.
[00:41:14.053 --> 00:41:14.973]  Well, how did we get here?
[00:41:15.214 --> 00:41:20.436]  You know, there's a great editorial by Pat Buchanan, who talks about all of this.
[00:41:21.597 --> 00:41:25.359]  And we understand that, you know, this is something that's been going on for 64 years.
[00:41:26.719 --> 00:41:33.463]  And it fundamentally goes back to how we got involved in all these domino wars in the Middle East, okay?
[00:41:33.643 --> 00:41:35.704]  But not the Middle East, rather in the Southeast Asia.
[00:41:37.153 --> 00:41:43.396]  We fought this one to a draw in South Korea, North and South Vietnam.
[00:41:43.476 --> 00:41:44.437]  We lost that one.
[00:41:45.177 --> 00:41:46.838]  What was the consequence in Vietnam?
[00:41:48.079 --> 00:41:53.141]  Well, we were told that we had to defeat that because of Chinese Communist hegemony.
[00:41:54.002 --> 00:42:03.126]  And yet, when we lost in Vietnam, what we wound up with was a country that is far more free market and actually an enemy of China.
[00:42:03.146 --> 00:42:05.808]  I'll never forget the documentary, The Fog of War.
[00:42:06.926 --> 00:42:13.588]  Where former Defense Secretary McNamara was doing an on-screen confession.
[00:42:14.188 --> 00:42:19.410]  And he said years later, he said he met with them and he admitted that the Gulf of Tonkin was a false flag to create that war.
[00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:24.892]  And he said the North Koreans slammed his fist on the table and said, what were you thinking?
[00:42:25.152 --> 00:42:27.813]  We have fought the Chinese for a thousand years.
[00:42:28.994 --> 00:42:30.916]  And he said, we were fighting them at the time.
[00:42:30.996 --> 00:42:32.277]  Why did you go to war with us?
[00:42:32.337 --> 00:42:35.781]  We have to understand where these wars are coming from.
[00:42:36.301 --> 00:42:40.745]  We have made ourselves the policemen of the world and now they expect us to keep doing it.
[00:42:40.825 --> 00:42:41.746]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:42:41.766 --> 00:42:45.610]  You are listening to GCN.

[00:42:51.537 --> 00:42:57.879]  According to the mainstream media, President Donald Trump was mean to kids on Easter Sunday.
[00:42:58.079 --> 00:43:09.162]  That's right, dozens of news outlets ran with a misleading video that was spread by Politico yesterday, claiming that President Trump signed a Kids Make America Great Again hat.
[00:43:09.482 --> 00:43:12.423]  And then threw it away from the kid into the crowd.
[00:43:12.684 --> 00:43:19.006]  The video quickly went viral, racking up nearly 10,000 retweets and getting picked up by other news outlets.
[00:43:19.407 --> 00:43:27.991]  The Washington Post reported Trump, using a thick sharpie, put his signature on the bill of the cap, then looked up and lobbed it into the crowd.
[00:43:28.351 --> 00:43:31.412]  Nowhere near the hand that had given it to him.
[00:43:31.973 --> 00:43:34.894]  BuzzFeed even claimed that the poor kid never got his hat back.
[00:43:35.194 --> 00:43:41.258]  But in reality, other camera angles clearly show the president and the kid were just having fun.
[00:43:41.399 --> 00:43:46.222]  And the boy indeed caught his hat signed by the President of the United States.
[00:43:46.742 --> 00:43:50.945]  You can see the videos for yourself right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:43:52.546 --> 00:43:58.431]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:31.089]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:31.129 --> 00:44:41.955]  We have a lot of people, radio stations, who carry news at the top of the hour, so I want to get back to what's going on in North Korea, but I want to wait for the stations, all the stations, to rejoin us before we get back to that.
[00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:49.155]  I want to talk about our relationship to our government, the coercion, the force that we see from our government so many times.
[00:44:49.195 --> 00:44:52.618]  And there's a couple of articles here that I think epitomize that.
[00:44:52.718 --> 00:45:04.669]  First of all, there's one out of the Sacramento Bee talking about how UC Davis student leaders have now voted to make the American flag optional at meetings instead of mandatory.
[00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.844]  Okay, it says they don't like the American flag.
[00:45:08.886 --> 00:45:13.174]  But when I look at this, I think about how many things are mandatory for us.
[00:45:14.136 --> 00:45:17.081]  How about if we got choice with health insurance?
[00:45:17.861 --> 00:45:18.381]  How about that?
[00:45:18.801 --> 00:45:31.945]  These same people who say, well, we're going to have a choice about whether or not we display the American flag at meetings, you can bet these UC Davis students who don't like the American flag love health insurance mandates.
[00:45:32.045 --> 00:45:33.805]  They don't want to give you a choice about your health insurance.
[00:45:33.825 --> 00:45:35.686]  They don't want to give you a choice about what level you want.
[00:45:36.445 --> 00:45:38.426]  They don't want to give you a choice about whether you're going to have it or not.
[00:45:38.446 --> 00:45:40.387]  They're going to ram that down your throat.
[00:45:40.427 --> 00:45:41.167]  But give me a choice, God.
[00:45:41.227 --> 00:45:42.788]  I don't like that American flag, okay?
[00:45:42.808 --> 00:45:48.531]  So they understand freedom of choice in some respects, but they don't respect it overall.
[00:45:49.551 --> 00:45:52.052]  And that's what we see time and time again.
[00:45:52.432 --> 00:45:55.574]  But I want to look at this article that my wife sent me, actually.
[00:45:55.634 --> 00:45:56.654]  She said, look at this.
[00:45:56.694 --> 00:45:58.095]  This is absolutely outrageous.
[00:45:58.135 --> 00:45:58.475]  And it is.
[00:45:58.535 --> 00:45:59.716]  It's from the Free Thought Project.
[00:46:00.729 --> 00:46:03.050]  And this is a NASA SWAT team.
[00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:05.070]  Did you know that NASA has a SWAT team?
[00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:06.111]  Yeah, they do.
[00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:09.772]  The Department of Education has a SWAT team.
[00:46:10.732 --> 00:46:13.873]  They've SWATed people for not paying their student loans.
[00:46:13.913 --> 00:46:26.977]  They drug a husband and his kids out in the wee hours of the morning, face down on the lawn, because the mother, who had left the family, no longer was paying her student loan.
[00:46:27.842 --> 00:46:30.424]  So they sent the Department of Education SWAT team.
[00:46:30.504 --> 00:46:38.708]  About a year before that, even the Washington Post said, we just saw this RFP for a bunch of SWAT equipment for the Department of Education.
[00:46:38.728 --> 00:46:39.329]  What's that about?
[00:46:39.669 --> 00:46:41.390]  Why would the Department of Education need that?
[00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:44.952]  Well, because they're going to play rough with anybody that doesn't pay their student loans.
[00:46:46.473 --> 00:46:51.636]  Now we see NASA with its SWAT team, and they're going after a 75-year-old grandmother.
[00:46:52.937 --> 00:46:53.297]  Why?
[00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:57.019]  Because they think she's got a little tiny piece of a moon rock.
[00:46:57.911 --> 00:46:58.671]  Okay.
[00:47:00.112 --> 00:47:03.733]  The situation was, this lady, her name is Joanne Davis.
[00:47:03.894 --> 00:47:04.614]  She's 75.
[00:47:04.654 --> 00:47:05.954]  She hit hard financial times.
[00:47:06.535 --> 00:47:10.176]  She found herself raising grandchildren after her daughter's death, her son's illness.
[00:47:10.536 --> 00:47:16.198]  Her husband was gone, so being the resourceful grandmother she is, she began thinking of ways that she could earn some cash.
[00:47:17.359 --> 00:47:21.220]  And her husband had worked as an Apollo 11 engineer.
[00:47:21.941 --> 00:47:27.323]  He saved a paperweight that had moon material and a little bit of a heat shield.
[00:47:28.146 --> 00:47:32.131]  He'd worked at the space program at the time, so he had that as a little tiny souvenir.
[00:47:32.832 --> 00:47:34.254]  So she's like, well, I'll sell that.
[00:47:35.035 --> 00:47:39.621]  I'll put that out for a... I don't know if it was eBay or wherever she put it.
[00:47:40.422 --> 00:47:44.808]  But NASA got wind of it, and they sent out a SWAT team to get back their stuff.
[00:47:46.517 --> 00:47:51.761]  And it'd be one thing if they just went out and got it, but it wasn't enough for them just to take this back from this grandmother.
[00:47:52.322 --> 00:47:53.603]  They had to humiliate her.
[00:47:54.063 --> 00:47:55.865]  They had to use excessive force.
[00:47:56.385 --> 00:47:59.647]  They organized a sting operation involving six armed officers.
[00:48:00.208 --> 00:48:08.274]  They forcibly seized this lucite paperweight that had a tiny moon rock the size of a rice grain, and they took it from this grandmother.
[00:48:08.294 --> 00:48:09.075]  Okay?
[00:48:09.655 --> 00:48:12.618]  And not only that, but then they held her there,
[00:48:13.576 --> 00:48:23.124]  And took her, as she stood in the parking lot of a Denny's restaurant, in pants that were soaked in urine.
[00:48:23.164 --> 00:48:24.985]  They refused to allow her to use the bathroom.
[00:48:25.225 --> 00:48:26.486]  She had to defecate in her pants.
[00:48:26.726 --> 00:48:27.647]  She was soaked in urine.
[00:48:28.168 --> 00:48:31.490]  And they kept her there, bullying her.
[00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:34.312]  They did it in a way that humiliated her.
[00:48:34.833 --> 00:48:37.095]  And I think that's a key thing that we need to understand.
[00:48:37.555 --> 00:48:38.275]  It's not enough!
[00:48:39.266 --> 00:48:41.447]  For our government to do, to enforce laws.
[00:48:42.007 --> 00:48:43.268]  They have to humiliate us.
[00:48:43.908 --> 00:48:56.175]  And if you want to know what's going on with the United Airlines thing, it starts with the government humiliating people with the TSA, telling the airport, the airlines, you don't have to take more than a certain amount of money and then we'll do it for you.
[00:48:56.215 --> 00:48:57.796]  We'll just throw these people off the plane.
[00:48:58.056 --> 00:48:59.677]  That's the brutality we have to fight against.
[00:49:02.057 --> 00:49:10.585]  On Sunday, Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones broke the news that Google contractors are being directed to rate InfoWars articles to push them even further down in search engine results.
[00:49:10.925 --> 00:49:13.547]  And liberals came out of the woodwork to say we were lying.
[00:49:13.868 --> 00:49:15.329]  Well now we have Business Insider.
[00:49:15.489 --> 00:49:21.835]  Google says rogue vendor violated guidelines by instructing contractors to rate InfoWars as untrustworthy site.
[00:49:22.035 --> 00:49:28.500]  Google said that the vendor had mistakenly told staffers working for the search engine that InfoWars should be ranked as a low-quality site.
[00:49:28.681 --> 00:49:28.981]  Oh yeah.
[00:49:29.201 --> 00:49:30.101]  We believe you, Google.
[00:49:30.301 --> 00:49:30.902]  We believe you.
[00:49:31.102 --> 00:49:39.344]  Google reps are attempting to distance themselves from the contractor's instructions by saying it does not instruct quality raters on how to grade specific websites.
[00:49:39.544 --> 00:49:42.205]  Let's read what the contractor said in their bonus example.
[00:49:42.425 --> 00:49:47.087]  While CNN isn't a perfect news outlet, it is a popular news source that covers stories with depth to compare.
[00:49:47.267 --> 00:49:51.048]  The InfoWars article is brief and only mentions statements from sources not typical.
[00:49:51.368 --> 00:49:57.970]  Of course they're talking about the recent Syrian chemical attack that we're saying is a false flag and is now being proven in spades.
[00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:01.270]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:50:02.311 --> 00:50:04.211]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[00:50:05.811 --> 00:50:11.493]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:50:12.193 --> 00:50:16.074]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:50:17.029 --> 00:50:19.252]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:50:19.352 --> 00:50:20.514]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:50:20.534 --> 00:50:23.758]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:50:24.719 --> 00:50:25.039]  Or more.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.062]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:50:27.583 --> 00:50:29.065]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:50:29.165 --> 00:50:32.068]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:50:32.108 --> 00:50:32.809]  It's actually scary.
[00:50:35.271 --> 00:50:45.333]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:50:46.333 --> 00:50:59.136]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[00:51:02.102 --> 00:51:05.684]  I'm going to commit blasphemy against the globalists right now in the New World Order.
[00:51:06.605 --> 00:51:19.294]  I'm going to tell all of you that we're celebrating the Christian holiday of Easter, Our Risen Christ, on the third day by having some of the biggest specials ever at InfoWarsTore.com on amazing supplements.
[00:51:19.754 --> 00:51:29.220]  You know, mainstream media demonizes us for selling high-quality organic supplements that are game changers, while they have all the poison big pharma drug ads all day sitting there poisoning the people.
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:31.922]  What a shameful group of wicked devils.
[00:51:32.582 --> 00:51:36.784]  Ladies and gentlemen, our Christ raised from the dead on the third day.
[00:51:37.925 --> 00:51:44.728]  And our republic can rise from the dead if we wake up to what the globalists are doing and if you support independent free media.
[00:51:45.169 --> 00:51:49.511]  There's never been a better time to support InfoWars with these specials at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:51:49.931 --> 00:51:51.252]  Because it's all about life.
[00:51:51.872 --> 00:51:59.436]  Get the products, whether it's water filtration, nutraceuticals, Patriot apparel, you name it, it's all available at InfoWarsStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:52:12.509 --> 00:52:14.671]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:52:15.151 --> 00:52:20.236]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.081]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:52:26.141 --> 00:52:26.761]  I'm David Knight.
[00:52:26.781 --> 00:52:30.044]  We're going to have Lee Stranahan, formerly with Breitbart.
[00:52:30.064 --> 00:52:32.086]  Of course, he knew Andrew Breitbart.
[00:52:32.126 --> 00:52:32.847]  He was there when
[00:52:33.975 --> 00:52:34.936]  Breitbart set that up.
[00:52:34.976 --> 00:52:36.237]  He also knows Steve Bannon.
[00:52:36.257 --> 00:52:39.559]  We're going to have him talk about the attacks on the press.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.001]  He is somebody who's a very experienced reporter.
[00:52:42.061 --> 00:52:46.664]  He has spoken out about the idea that we would shut down entire sites.
[00:52:46.684 --> 00:52:50.787]  It's bad enough, as I pointed out, that they would focus on a particular story and label that as false.
[00:52:50.827 --> 00:52:58.413]  But then to focus on an entire site and shut that down is... Google is trying to push this back and say this is just a rogue contractor.
[00:52:59.554 --> 00:53:00.195]  Well, okay.
[00:53:01.076 --> 00:53:04.880]  It still showed what your business model is, what your strategy is.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:08.645]  And as I pointed out, they are outsourcing censorship.
[00:53:09.126 --> 00:53:11.389]  This is a public-private partnership.
[00:53:12.361 --> 00:53:20.671]  A government monopoly that gets special favors and help from the government and they're working with the government to outsource this censorship.
[00:53:21.212 --> 00:53:29.583]  I want to get back to South Korea then we're going to go to what's happening with taxes today, some updates on taxes as well as the election that is happening in Georgia.
[00:53:30.902 --> 00:53:38.289]  As I was saying in the last section before we went to the top of the hour break, we have some hopeful news.
[00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:43.494]  U.S., South Korea and Japan are hopefully going to be convening trilateral talks on North Korea.
[00:53:43.514 --> 00:53:46.697]  This was an announcement made by the South Korean Ministry of Defense.
[00:53:47.398 --> 00:53:51.360]  Meanwhile, North Korea is still warning that thermonuclear war may break out any moment.
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:59.964]  The Chinese spokesperson is saying that this is maybe pouring oil on the fire, so we'll just have to see what is going on with that.
[00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:08.968]  But there's also an economic aspect of this, and of course this is a reversal that Donald Trump has done, saying that there's no currency manipulation going on by China.
[00:54:09.248 --> 00:54:12.250]  Understand, currency manipulation is just one of the things that China has done.
[00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:16.351]  To attack America's economy.
[00:54:16.871 --> 00:54:21.052]  We have the Chamber of Commerce and Pat Buchanan pointing this out.
[00:54:21.132 --> 00:54:26.593]  Two people who are, two groups, a group and a person who are not usually on the same side of this issue.
[00:54:27.293 --> 00:54:36.955]  The Chamber of Commerce says that Trump needs to use every arrow in his quiver against the unfair advantages that China has.
[00:54:38.294 --> 00:54:40.836]  And what are these arrows that are in their quiver?
[00:54:40.896 --> 00:54:46.861]  What is the China price that allows them to produce things at 30 to 50 percent cheaper than we can here in America?
[00:54:47.641 --> 00:54:50.063]  Well, they have obviously lower labor prices.
[00:54:50.143 --> 00:54:51.704]  They have low wages.
[00:54:51.784 --> 00:54:55.507]  They have no safety for their employees.
[00:54:55.888 --> 00:54:58.309]  They protect their own markets very vigorously.
[00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:05.615]  Here you have the Chinese President Xi coming out and saying, we've got to have open free trade, just like Henry Kissinger told me.
[00:55:05.675 --> 00:55:07.857]  He taught us all of this, how to do this, right?
[00:55:09.278 --> 00:55:15.261]  We have to have free trade and yet they are the ones who are the most rigorous about protectionism.
[00:55:15.781 --> 00:55:19.623]  The same people that are preaching that we have to open our markets.
[00:55:19.643 --> 00:55:23.185]  We have to open our gates to their goods.
[00:55:23.245 --> 00:55:25.066]  They're going to protect their internal markets.
[00:55:25.086 --> 00:55:26.507]  They also pirate copyrights.
[00:55:26.527 --> 00:55:29.168]  That's a key part of the China price.
[00:55:29.729 --> 00:55:33.090]  And of course there's no restriction on environmental regulations.
[00:55:33.711 --> 00:55:37.653]  But we have restrictions that are put on us with the Paris Climate Treaty.
[00:55:38.433 --> 00:55:49.777]  We're going to have far more stringent controls put on our industry, and that's going to happen at a much earlier date before they have even minor restrictions put on their industry.
[00:55:49.897 --> 00:55:55.379]  One of the things that happened last week, remember, they buy a lot of coal from North Korea.
[00:55:55.519 --> 00:55:58.980]  See, the Chinese can still buy massive amounts of coal.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.401]  Obama didn't have a problem with that.
[00:56:01.501 --> 00:56:03.542]  But I thought it was global warming.
[00:56:04.737 --> 00:56:05.578]  No, no, no, no.
[00:56:05.598 --> 00:56:11.245]  They're only concerned about it if America and Europe are warming the globe.
[00:56:11.685 --> 00:56:14.989]  It's not a problem when China does it or India does it.
[00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:16.831]  They're given a special pass on that.
[00:56:17.625 --> 00:56:27.434]  That evidence of that was the fact that China had, as trying to get North Korea to get a little bit more rational, they said, we're going to stop taking your coal shipments.
[00:56:27.814 --> 00:56:32.679]  And then last week, as a gesture to Trump, when he said, oh, you're not currency manipulators anymore.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.260]  Right, right.
[00:56:34.961 --> 00:56:43.648]  When he said, you're not currency manipulators anymore, they said, all right, we're going to just send those, that fleet of ships carrying coal, we're going to send them back to North Korea.
[00:56:43.688 --> 00:56:43.988]  We're done.
[00:56:44.028 --> 00:56:45.389]  We're not going to take that.
[00:56:45.409 --> 00:56:48.171]  They're still going to burn coal, they just won't buy it from North Korea.
[00:56:48.972 --> 00:56:51.033]  So, we look at a couple of these different things.
[00:56:51.194 --> 00:56:56.678]  The subsidies of their own industries, low labor prices, the currency manipulation.
[00:56:57.679 --> 00:56:58.499]  We're going to
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:00.842]  We're good to go.
[00:57:13.174 --> 00:57:13.895]  We're good to go.
[00:57:34.195 --> 00:57:44.240]  As a matter of fact, Jefferson was proud of the fact when he gave his second inaugural address, he said, uh, we have eliminated all internal taxations by eliminating unnecessary offices.
[00:57:45.481 --> 00:57:52.944]  So you go back to a constitutionally sized government, you can run a constitutionally sized government off of taxes at the border.
[00:57:53.805 --> 00:57:58.327]  And Jefferson said, what farmer, what laborer, what mechanic knows a taxman?
[00:57:58.867 --> 00:58:01.989]  Well, in America today, all of us know the taxman, don't we?
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:04.421]  But they didn't at Jefferson's time.
[00:58:05.041 --> 00:58:05.782]  How did that change?
[00:58:05.802 --> 00:58:10.025]  Well, that changed when we got the Federal Reserve and we got the income tax in 1913.
[00:58:10.885 --> 00:58:14.648]  And we've lost over 99% of the purchasing power of the U.S.
[00:58:14.688 --> 00:58:16.289]  dollar in that amount of time as well.
[00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:21.493]  That's the legacy of the income tax, the legacy of the Federal Reserve.
[00:58:23.675 --> 00:58:26.717]  Donald Trump who criticized, who said maybe we need to audit the Fed.
[00:58:26.737 --> 00:58:28.097]  He criticized Janet Yellen.
[00:58:28.157 --> 00:58:30.679]  Now he's saying well I think Janet Yellen is pretty good.
[00:58:31.059 --> 00:58:39.164]  We're going to use her to weaken our currency because we're going to pretend that the Chinese are not manipulating their currency.
[00:58:39.224 --> 00:58:45.768]  So the Chamber of Commerce is saying right now basically we're recommending to President Trump everything you have in your quiver.
[00:58:45.888 --> 00:58:51.352]  Please use every arrow possible with the understanding that some of these points of leverage that you're using
[00:58:52.032 --> 00:58:53.933]  We'll be counterproductive to us.
[00:58:54.873 --> 00:58:58.695]  They say that, of course, Trump promised to curb US trade deficits with China.
[00:58:58.715 --> 00:59:00.996]  They've reached $347 billion.
[00:59:01.036 --> 00:59:02.537]  Not a problem now.
[00:59:03.117 --> 00:59:03.578]  Not a problem.
[00:59:04.358 --> 00:59:10.141]  We will give them a free pass as long as we can engage in military adventurism abroad.
[00:59:11.601 --> 00:59:19.230]  Now according to the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Beijing can offer subsidies of billions of dollars to domestic competitors.
[00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:20.591]  That's part of the China price.
[00:59:20.631 --> 00:59:30.842]  He said, I'm sorry to see there is a possibility we may lose some momentum on helping to level the playing field with China in our economic relationship due to the situation in North Korea.
[00:59:31.563 --> 00:59:33.005]  If there is some kind of a trade-off.
[00:59:33.025 --> 00:59:34.427]  Well, you can believe that there is a trade-off.
[00:59:34.527 --> 00:59:36.310]  Pat Buchanan pointed it out.
[00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:43.579]  He quoted President Trump, who said, why would I call China a currency manipulator when they're working with us on the North Korean problem?
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.563]  So he said, right there, we see that
[00:59:48.188 --> 01:00:03.935]  Trump, who once seemed to understand how America had taken us to the cleaners during and after the Cold War, while allies supported us diplomatically, they piled up huge trade surpluses at our expense, and they became virtual free riders off of the U.S.
[01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:04.776]  defense effort.
[01:00:05.891 --> 01:00:08.373]  And so that's Patrick Buchanan pointing that out.
[01:00:08.933 --> 01:00:12.616]  He said, a continuing crisis on the peninsula with Trump and the U.S.
[01:00:12.656 --> 01:00:15.878]  relying on Beijing's help could leave Xi in the catbird seat.
[01:00:15.958 --> 01:00:21.502]  And now that North Korea has declared its goal to be building missiles with nuclear warheads that could hit all U.S.
[01:00:21.542 --> 01:00:24.444]  bases in Asia, even California, the clock is running for the White House.
[01:00:25.285 --> 01:00:28.207]  Tillerson and Pence have said that they're running out of patience.
[01:00:28.987 --> 01:00:30.909]  But the question is this, how did we get to this point?
[01:00:32.008 --> 01:00:32.589]  How did we get to this?
[01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.630]  It's not Obama's fault, okay?
[01:00:34.971 --> 01:00:39.254]  I mean, I'm not going to blame everything on Obama.
[01:00:40.596 --> 01:00:43.478]  This is just as much Bush's fault and the Republicans' fault.
[01:00:43.498 --> 01:00:44.619]  This has been going on for 64 years.
[01:00:46.718 --> 01:00:49.080]  And many people have said, well, other people could have done something about it.
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.842]  Now Donald Trump is going to have to do something about it.
[01:00:50.882 --> 01:00:52.823]  But how did we get into the Korean War?
[01:00:53.464 --> 01:00:56.907]  We got into the Korean War because we decided we needed to be the world's policemen.
[01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:07.996]  We decided that the first Americans who put America first, the founders of our country, didn't know what they were talking about when they said, we don't go abroad seeking monsters to destroy.
[01:01:08.396 --> 01:01:11.459]  And a good example of this is the Turkey election that's happening.
[01:01:12.125 --> 01:01:16.106]  We've got a civil war going on in Turkey, and it's spilling over onto our shores.
[01:01:16.186 --> 01:01:21.687]  The competition between Erdogan and Fethullah Gulen is spilling into Europe as well.
[01:01:22.867 --> 01:01:25.047]  This competition shows us something in Turkey.
[01:01:25.667 --> 01:01:28.228]  There's not always a good guy and a bad guy.
[01:01:28.908 --> 01:01:31.828]  Sometimes there's just two really bad guys.
[01:01:32.149 --> 01:01:35.929]  Both Erdogan and Fethullah Gulen are not secularists.
[01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:40.030]  They want to preside over a caliphate, a global caliphate if they will.
[01:01:41.377 --> 01:01:51.808]  And so as we see their influence spread throughout Europe and throughout the United States, and as we've seen in other places where we go in to do regime change, it always backfires.
[01:01:52.929 --> 01:01:55.551]  Even if we win a war, we don't win the peace.
[01:01:56.853 --> 01:02:00.937]  This whole thing about acting as the world's policemen is doomed to failure.
[01:02:02.216 --> 01:02:07.039]  Now, when they said that we don't go abroad seeking monsters to destroy, they were talking about getting involved in European wars.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.682]  We saw what happened with World War I. That was an unnecessary war for us to get involved in.
[01:02:12.263 --> 01:02:14.584]  What would they have said about the Middle East situation?
[01:02:14.604 --> 01:02:22.750]  I mean, even Ronald Reagan, after the bombing in Beirut, said, I'm going to get my troops out of here.
[01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:24.351]  And he got his troops out of there.
[01:02:25.752 --> 01:02:30.976]  But we continue to go in, even though we see these regime changes like we had in Libya.
[01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:33.912]  Create a much worse problem.
[01:02:33.992 --> 01:02:49.121]  As Pat Buchanan said, why 64 years after the Korean War, a quarter century after the Cold War, are we still obliged to go to war to defend South Korea from the North with one half of the South Korean population and with 3% of its gross domestic product?
[01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:49.921]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[01:02:49.941 --> 01:02:51.362]  I'll tell you why, Pat.
[01:02:51.782 --> 01:02:55.004]  It's because we have put ourselves out there as protectors.
[01:02:55.024 --> 01:02:57.826]  So it's now no longer an issue between North and South Korea.
[01:02:58.706 --> 01:02:59.828]  They're coming after us.
[01:03:00.169 --> 01:03:01.090]  We're the target now.
[01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:04.997]  Because we have said, we're going to shut down all the monsters everywhere.
[01:03:05.037 --> 01:03:06.459]  We know exactly what we're doing.
[01:03:06.499 --> 01:03:07.040]  No, we don't.
[01:03:08.564 --> 01:03:12.287]  You know, why should their nuclear missiles be America's primary responsibility?
[01:03:12.327 --> 01:03:14.068]  Why don't the South Koreans do something about it?
[01:03:14.609 --> 01:03:17.091]  Why do we have to be the world's policemen?
[01:03:17.991 --> 01:03:19.052]  It is not going to work.
[01:03:19.072 --> 01:03:34.023]  And now we have a situation where, instead of following an America First policy, instead of listening to the first Americans, the founders of our country, we now have a situation where we've got people like John McCain calling Rand Paul a Russian agent.
[01:03:34.904 --> 01:03:45.549]  Because he merely says that we ought to have a debate before we set up another tripwire with a tiny country in Europe, before we set up another possibility where we would have to go to war to defend them.
[01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:47.950]  Can't we see where this is all leading?
[01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:52.712]  Can't we see that this is a failed policy that's been 64 years in the making?
[01:03:53.312 --> 01:03:55.153]  Can't we put America first for once?
[01:03:55.953 --> 01:03:56.433]  Perhaps not.
[01:03:57.314 --> 01:03:58.214]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:00.235]  We're going to have Lee Stranahan joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:19.194]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[01:04:19.234 --> 01:04:21.196]  Now, this is our 20th product.
[01:04:21.956 --> 01:04:28.860]  We can easily go out to a major vitamin or supplement company and private label a thousand different products.
[01:04:29.461 --> 01:04:35.245]  But it's taken us four plus years to even come out with 20, because we private label some, but we also develop
[01:04:36.141 --> 01:04:45.914]  Many of the products originally were some of the top labs in the country, so that they're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe, and they're also very affordable.
[01:04:45.934 --> 01:04:48.057]  Exactly, you talk about being a game changer, right?
[01:04:48.077 --> 01:04:52.724]  You talk about, we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders, we've both talked to them.
[01:04:53.044 --> 01:04:58.926]  They have conveyor belts of herbs falling on the ground and they have someone come and sweep them up and put them back on the conveyor belt.
[01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:08.250]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[01:05:09.110 --> 01:05:10.230]  We refuse to screw people.
[01:05:10.571 --> 01:05:11.531]  We refuse to do that.
[01:05:11.911 --> 01:05:14.572]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[01:05:14.652 --> 01:05:16.593]  We're producing something we want to take.
[01:05:16.673 --> 01:05:17.093]  Exactly.
[01:05:17.473 --> 01:05:18.514]  We're looking for the best.
[01:05:18.554 --> 01:05:23.416]  We went out and searched for the best, the private label, and most of the time found out it wasn't available.
[01:05:23.616 --> 01:05:27.298]  So we go to these big firms and say, we want to make the dream formula.
[01:05:27.318 --> 01:05:33.301]  Bio PCA, for example, one of the ingredients is silica, and it's from bamboo extract.
[01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:34.782]  It's everywhere.
[01:05:34.962 --> 01:05:35.642]  It's in nature.
[01:05:35.702 --> 01:05:37.803]  It's an essential part of being healthy, right?
[01:05:38.163 --> 01:05:44.226]  Just this bottle of silica, okay, again, one ingredient, in a lower amount that's even in our product, is $35.
[01:05:45.387 --> 01:05:50.651]  They're charging more than what we charge when they have one ingredient that's less than ours.
[01:05:50.671 --> 01:05:51.311]  This is insane.
[01:05:51.331 --> 01:06:00.498]  When I told him we wanted 10,000 micrograms, he goes, okay, I get that you guys want to do, you know, high power stuff, but why don't you just do 3,000 and then you can sell, you know, multiple bottles of it.
[01:06:00.538 --> 01:06:01.419]  People will buy more of it.
[01:06:01.539 --> 01:06:02.120]  I was like, no, let's do 10.
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:02.680]  Okay.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.001]  Compare that to this.
[01:06:04.221 --> 01:06:05.602]  This is a $50 product.
[01:06:05.622 --> 01:06:09.005]  One of the leaders in the industry has 3,000 micrograms of biotin.
[01:06:09.025 --> 01:06:09.145]  Okay.
[01:06:09.245 --> 01:06:09.445]  We have 10,000.
[01:06:09.485 --> 01:06:10.226]  This is $50, $48 to be exact.
[01:06:13.268 --> 01:06:15.129]  There's no script, there's no teleprompter, I'll just be honest with you.
[01:06:15.549 --> 01:06:20.812]  My problem is, with 20 products now, it's remembering to take them all.
[01:06:21.412 --> 01:06:24.673]  Because when I do, I have great days, great weeks, a great life.
[01:06:25.094 --> 01:06:31.057]  When I forget to take the X2, a super male, or the lung cleanse, or to do a liver cleanse, or to take this product,
[01:06:32.173 --> 01:06:33.794]  My quality of life just isn't as good.
[01:06:33.874 --> 01:06:34.954]  It's changed my life.
[01:06:35.054 --> 01:06:37.295]  I looked like Jabba the Hutt four years ago.
[01:06:37.635 --> 01:06:39.515]  I was swimming two miles some days a day.
[01:06:39.916 --> 01:06:41.356]  I was jogging, lifting weights.
[01:06:41.416 --> 01:06:42.276]  I couldn't lose the weight.
[01:06:43.177 --> 01:06:50.239]  I went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the InfoWars change the country and the world.
[01:06:50.619 --> 01:06:51.379]  It's a win-win.
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:52.640]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:04.632]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[01:07:06.314 --> 01:07:11.981]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:07:12.701 --> 01:07:16.586]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:07:17.552 --> 01:07:19.753]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:07:19.853 --> 01:07:20.994]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:07:21.014 --> 01:07:24.235]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[01:07:25.216 --> 01:07:25.556]  Or more.
[01:07:25.636 --> 01:07:27.597]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:29.558]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[01:07:29.638 --> 01:07:32.600]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.440]  It's actually scary.
[01:07:35.761 --> 01:07:45.826]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:07:46.847 --> 01:07:59.653]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:20.682]  Well that's appropriate.
[01:08:20.702 --> 01:08:22.763]  We're going to be talking about the income tax.
[01:08:22.823 --> 01:08:25.044]  The IRS is demanding that you get your forms in today.
[01:08:25.064 --> 01:08:27.306]  I am a man of constant sorrow.
[01:08:27.366 --> 01:08:32.408]  That's a song to sing while you're doing your 1040 returns and we'll talk about that in just a moment.
[01:08:33.009 --> 01:08:39.733]  Before we do, real quickly, I'll remind you that the Easter Mega Specials that we put up at InfoWarsStore.com will be ending tonight.
[01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:45.476]  Those sales are 25 to 30% off a wide variety of products.
[01:08:45.516 --> 01:08:47.217]  You'll see that at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:08:47.477 --> 01:08:50.338]  Things like Super Male, Super Female Vitality, 25% off.
[01:08:50.819 --> 01:08:54.420]  Secret 12, our Vitamin B12 formulation, that's 25% off.
[01:08:54.941 --> 01:08:58.443]  Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, that is 25% off.
[01:08:58.823 --> 01:09:00.944]  And this is while supplies last.
[01:09:01.184 --> 01:09:07.147]  Because we are quickly selling out of our remaining Deep Earth Iodine supply at Infowarslife.com.
[01:09:07.567 --> 01:09:10.308]  We're having difficulty getting access to that.
[01:09:10.328 --> 01:09:17.512]  A lot of people have found out about that, and so now there's competition from other industries trying to get to that pure source of iodine.
[01:09:17.552 --> 01:09:19.413]  So get that while supplies last.
[01:09:19.633 --> 01:09:22.994]  Once that runs out, it may be a while before we can get that resupplied.
[01:09:23.414 --> 01:09:26.596]  So we have that now as part of that Easter special, 25% off, and 30% off Brain Force.
[01:09:29.057 --> 01:09:31.919]  Again, my favorite supplement that we have at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:09:31.939 --> 01:09:32.539]  You can find that.
[01:09:32.559 --> 01:09:34.180]  It's now Brain Force Plus.
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:39.384]  You get extra quantity in those tablets.
[01:09:39.444 --> 01:09:41.625]  Each of them are a little bit larger than they used to be.
[01:09:42.045 --> 01:09:45.768]  We're going to have Lee Stranahan joining us in the next segment.
[01:09:45.808 --> 01:09:50.150]  He's going to be talking about censorship, but I want to go to the tax issue right now.
[01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:54.653]  We have Maxine Waters who chimed in on this.
[01:09:54.693 --> 01:09:57.575]  Let's hear what Maxine Waters has to say about taxes.
[01:09:59.631 --> 01:10:03.573]  Americans all over this country, many are struggling to pay their taxes.
[01:10:03.873 --> 01:10:09.076]  Middle income people, working people, and many have to pay taxes that they can't afford.
[01:10:09.496 --> 01:10:15.859]  And here we are, they are struggling to pay their taxes, and this president basically laughing at us.
[01:10:16.119 --> 01:10:19.641]  Because remember, during the campaign, he said, I pay no taxes.
[01:10:19.961 --> 01:10:22.282]  And I believe that, and many people believe that.
[01:10:22.912 --> 01:10:24.213]  See that's the politics of Envy.
[01:10:24.994 --> 01:10:28.838]  She doesn't want you to pay attention to the taxes that you're struggling to pay.
[01:10:28.998 --> 01:10:31.621]  No, she wants to see Donald Trump's tax returns.
[01:10:31.641 --> 01:10:33.823]  We want to know that Donald Trump is paying a lot of taxes.
[01:10:33.883 --> 01:10:35.805]  Does that make you, would that make you feel any better?
[01:10:35.825 --> 01:10:37.347]  To know that Donald Trump paid...
[01:10:39.849 --> 01:10:44.271]  50%, 75%, 90% of his income in taxes, when they're taking a bite out of your paycheck?
[01:10:45.052 --> 01:10:48.514]  See, I don't really care about Donald Trump's tax returns.
[01:10:49.114 --> 01:10:53.036]  I want Donald Trump's tax reforms that he campaigned on.
[01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:54.157]  And that's the question.
[01:10:54.177 --> 01:10:55.057]  Are we going to see that?
[01:10:55.417 --> 01:11:00.480]  Mnuchin is saying that tax reform may be delayed because of the health care setback.
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:02.081]  And of course, this is U.S.
[01:11:02.121 --> 01:11:03.622]  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
[01:11:04.542 --> 01:11:15.205]  He told the Financial Times that the target to get tax reform through Congress on President Trump's desk before August was, quote, highly aggressive to not realistic at this point.
[01:11:15.245 --> 01:11:19.006]  He says it's probably fair to say that it's been delayed a bit because of health care.
[01:11:19.346 --> 01:11:24.908]  He also told the Financial Times that he agreed with Trump's view that the dollar's strength in the short term was hurting exports.
[01:11:25.988 --> 01:11:31.512]  Count on the Federal Reserve to weaken the dollar for us, and maybe you're not going to get that health care repeal.
[01:11:32.013 --> 01:11:39.538]  And because of the billions of dollars of taxes and health care that you're paying, we're still going to have to keep your income taxes there.
[01:11:39.558 --> 01:11:45.723]  See, that's one of the reasons why we're having the increase in military action around the world, to hide that.
[01:11:46.463 --> 01:11:50.764]  Let's take a look at what's going on with the key numbers, as The Hill points out.
[01:11:50.784 --> 01:11:53.225]  The key numbers on Tax Filing Day.
[01:11:53.265 --> 01:11:56.286]  They say 152 million individuals will be filing tax returns.
[01:11:56.706 --> 01:12:04.348]  And IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said earlier this month, this appears to be the smoothest filing season the agency has had since he took office.
[01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:05.768]  And he's still there.
[01:12:06.848 --> 01:12:09.089]  And Lois Lerner is not being prosecuted.
[01:12:10.029 --> 01:12:13.510]  See, they lost their records, didn't they, when they were persecuting
[01:12:14.605 --> 01:12:20.949]  Different organizations for their political views, withholding their tax-deductible access.
[01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:26.333]  And of course, for an organization that they were friendly to, it happened in just a couple of days.
[01:12:26.373 --> 01:12:32.436]  Some of these organizations that they would not give the 501c benefit to still haven't gotten it, years later.
[01:12:33.317 --> 01:12:34.599]  But you know, I think it's interesting.
[01:12:34.639 --> 01:12:36.021]  We see that they're now moving forward.
[01:12:36.041 --> 01:12:40.647]  We've got the ACLJ moving forward to try to get some of those records from the IRS.
[01:12:41.468 --> 01:12:43.370]  But we've got a story here on MarketWatch.
[01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:45.854]  Americans get an F on the income tax quiz.
[01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:47.255]  I think this was on the Drudge Report.
[01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:50.911]  And of course, it's been, like I said before, 104 years.
[01:12:51.631 --> 01:13:02.213]  Think about the fact that in 1913, the standard deduction, if you adjust it to today's dollars, because remember, the Federal Reserve has decimated the purchasing power of your dollars.
[01:13:02.413 --> 01:13:03.213]  That's not enough.
[01:13:03.233 --> 01:13:05.093]  I mean, decimated would only be one-tenth.
[01:13:05.373 --> 01:13:07.554]  They've taken 99% of your purchasing power.
[01:13:08.114 --> 01:13:12.115]  If you had the same standard deduction that you did back then, that would be worth $98,000 today.
[01:13:13.595 --> 01:13:18.045]  So you'd have to pay, have to earn, have a taxable income of more than $98,000 before you'd pay any taxes.
[01:13:20.353 --> 01:13:21.353]  Today, that is only $12,500.
[01:13:21.413 --> 01:13:26.855]  There's only 400 pages in 1913, the tax code.
[01:13:27.356 --> 01:13:28.056]  Today, it's $75,000.
[01:13:29.336 --> 01:13:35.439]  You know, the average Bible is only about $1,200, and yet the IRS code is $75,000?
[01:13:36.219 --> 01:13:40.440]  Charles Murray said, a law that is sufficiently complex is the same as having no law at all.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.561]  Even the IRS doesn't know.
[01:13:41.821 --> 01:13:46.022]  But they can use that against you as if it was lawless, because it is so complex.
[01:13:46.263 --> 01:13:47.223]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:13:50.307 --> 01:13:53.294]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:13:53.314 --> 01:13:56.943]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:14:01.929 --> 01:14:03.290]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:08.333]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:14:09.414 --> 01:14:11.696]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:14:11.976 --> 01:14:17.339]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:26.385]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:14:26.626 --> 01:14:31.709]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:14:31.969 --> 01:14:38.674]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[01:14:38.954 --> 01:14:43.537]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:14:43.697 --> 01:14:46.839]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:48.881]  That's privatepowergrid.com.

[01:15:01.261 --> 01:15:07.605]  According to the mainstream media, President Donald Trump was mean to kids on Easter Sunday.
[01:15:07.805 --> 01:15:22.172]  That's right, dozens of news outlets ran with a misleading video that was spread by Politico yesterday, claiming that President Trump signed a Kids Make America Great Again hat and then threw it away from the kid into the crowd.
[01:15:22.433 --> 01:15:28.736]  The video quickly went viral, racking up nearly 10,000 retweets and getting picked up by other news outlets.
[01:15:29.136 --> 01:15:37.727]  The Washington Post reported Trump, using a thick sharpie, put his signature on the bill of the cap, then looked up and lobbed it into the crowd.
[01:15:38.087 --> 01:15:41.151]  Nowhere near the hand that had given it to him.
[01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:44.635]  BuzzFeed even claimed that the poor kid never got his hat back.
[01:15:44.935 --> 01:15:50.977]  But in reality, other camera angles clearly show the president and the kid were just having fun.
[01:15:51.137 --> 01:15:55.939]  And the boy indeed caught his hat signed by the President of the United States.
[01:15:56.459 --> 01:16:00.641]  You can see the videos for yourself right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:16:01.101 --> 01:16:02.541]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:16:41.459 --> 01:16:43.380]  And this part is most important.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:50.284]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:16:50.324 --> 01:16:51.404]  That means it's clean.
[01:16:51.745 --> 01:16:52.785]  That means it's pure.
[01:16:52.905 --> 01:16:55.727]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the Infowar.

[01:17:09.307 --> 01:17:10.229]  You found it.
[01:17:10.549 --> 01:17:12.052]  The tip of the spear.
[01:17:12.593 --> 01:17:16.940]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[01:17:19.918 --> 01:17:21.399]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:17:21.459 --> 01:17:24.321]  I'm David Knight, and we're going to be talking to Lee Stranahan.
[01:17:24.501 --> 01:17:26.762]  Lee Stranahan was formerly with Breitbart.
[01:17:26.862 --> 01:17:28.163]  He knew Andrew Breitbart.
[01:17:28.183 --> 01:17:29.884]  He also knows Steve Bannon.
[01:17:30.224 --> 01:17:32.485]  He is now the editor of ThePopulous.us.
[01:17:32.525 --> 01:17:38.168]  He's a co-host on Fault Lines, on Sputnik, and he has a citizen journalism school.
[01:17:38.209 --> 01:17:40.870]  You'll find that at citizenjournalismschool.com.
[01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:41.811]  And I've seen
[01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:50.037]  Lee, talk about journalism issues, his periscopes that he has on Twitter, you can follow him there at Stranahan.
[01:17:50.558 --> 01:17:56.722]  Talking about the lazy thinking that is present when you say, I'm just going to discount this because of the source.
[01:17:56.802 --> 01:17:58.744]  I'm not going to pay attention to the content here.
[01:17:59.745 --> 01:18:01.467]  But now we're seeing this weaponized.
[01:18:01.547 --> 01:18:06.192]  We're now seeing government censorship being outsourced to Google.
[01:18:06.212 --> 01:18:16.844]  And these articles that we've seen the last couple of days, the fact that they would use InfoWars as a poster child and say, we're going to downrate the same story.
[01:18:17.878 --> 01:18:18.598]  For InfoWars.
[01:18:18.618 --> 01:18:24.999]  We're going to uprate it for CNN because we like CNN and we don't like InfoWars because InfoWars has a bad reputation.
[01:18:25.039 --> 01:18:25.199]  Why?
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:26.120]  Because we tell you so.
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:27.720]  They're not going to talk about the stories.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:28.760]  They're going to talk about the sites.
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:36.902]  They're not even, it's bad enough if they were going to set themselves up as arbiters of individual articles, but no, they're going to say we're going to take down an entire site.
[01:18:36.922 --> 01:18:45.304]  So I want to go to Lee and I want to talk to him about that as well as we'll get his take on what's going on in the White House with Steve Bannon.
[01:18:45.824 --> 01:18:46.624]  But let's talk about
[01:18:47.425 --> 01:18:52.384]  The outsourcing of censorship first and the demonizing of individual sources, Lee.
[01:18:53.641 --> 01:18:56.142]  Yeah, David, I really appreciate you having me on.
[01:18:56.402 --> 01:18:58.363]  You know, I'm a big fan of yours and thanks so much.
[01:18:58.883 --> 01:19:00.704]  Well, look, I mean, here's what's disturbing.
[01:19:00.724 --> 01:19:03.346]  So, I don't like the term fake news, okay?
[01:19:04.366 --> 01:19:07.768]  I prefer the term narrative-driven news and here's why, okay?
[01:19:08.188 --> 01:19:13.370]  First off, every news source in the world occasionally gets facts wrong.
[01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:14.491]  Does that make sense?
[01:19:14.691 --> 01:19:14.851]  Yeah.
[01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:18.112]  And that's fine and you retract and that's fine.
[01:19:18.152 --> 01:19:19.173]  That's normal, right?
[01:19:20.046 --> 01:19:28.189]  And there is such a thing as fake news, but the bigger problem, I think, is what I call narrative-driven news, which is this.
[01:19:28.249 --> 01:19:29.510]  Let's take a simple issue.
[01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:30.891]  I'm going to give just an example.
[01:19:31.651 --> 01:19:33.031]  Let's say immigration, okay?
[01:19:33.412 --> 01:19:37.033]  Now, let's say you've got two stories, and they're both completely true.
[01:19:37.854 --> 01:19:43.376]  One story is about a woman who came here illegally, and she's got three kids.
[01:19:43.456 --> 01:19:47.998]  She, you know, has worked for 20 years, but she's here illegally, and she's getting deported.
[01:19:48.678 --> 01:19:54.924]  The second story is about a woman whose child was killed by an illegal alien who'd been deported three times.
[01:19:55.705 --> 01:19:56.025]  Okay?
[01:19:56.405 --> 01:20:00.049]  Now, assume both of those stories are completely true, because those things both happened.
[01:20:00.109 --> 01:20:00.829]  Does that make sense?
[01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.730]  Right.
[01:20:02.371 --> 01:20:04.072]  Which story is CNN going to cover?
[01:20:04.853 --> 01:20:05.073]  Right?
[01:20:05.414 --> 01:20:05.614]  Yeah.
[01:20:06.014 --> 01:20:08.456]  The deportation story of the victim, yeah.
[01:20:09.257 --> 01:20:11.079]  And which story is Breitbart going to cover?
[01:20:11.119 --> 01:20:12.520]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:20:13.826 --> 01:20:24.074]  So my point here is that what they don't like about sites like InfoWars is that you guys cover stories that are outside their narrative.
[01:20:24.394 --> 01:20:26.296]  You're outside their normal lane.
[01:20:26.916 --> 01:20:39.846]  And when we talk about the mainstream media, I like to differentiate that because really what I define the mainstream media as is that group of media that all covered literally... Let me give you a simple example, right?
[01:20:39.886 --> 01:20:41.948]  So as you mentioned, I'm on Sputnik now, right?
[01:20:42.468 --> 01:20:44.690]  I have a Monday through Friday radio show on Sputnik.
[01:20:45.611 --> 01:20:48.253]  That means I'm on a Russian propaganda network, right?
[01:20:48.634 --> 01:21:03.987]  Now, who decided, I'm not saying that it's invalid to talk about Russia, but who decided that the media would spend 99% of the time talking about Russia, and how much do you hear the mainstream media talk about Saudi Arabia, for instance, okay?
[01:21:05.108 --> 01:21:07.350]  I would argue that Saudi Arabia
[01:21:08.303 --> 01:21:20.070]  Because they've helped promote Islamist terrorism through a group called the Muslim World League, okay, is a bigger story than Russia in terms of the actual threat.
[01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:26.134]  And by the way, of course, Saudi Arabia contributed big to the Clinton Foundation, also big contributors to John McCain.
[01:21:26.654 --> 01:21:28.295]  None of this is conjecture, it's all accurate.
[01:21:28.335 --> 01:21:31.557]  And by the way, the Bushes, remember the Michael Moore film showing
[01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:36.516]  George Bush holding hands with the Saudi Prince there, remember?
[01:21:36.776 --> 01:21:37.036]  Yes.
[01:21:37.076 --> 01:21:47.501]  So, what I'm saying is, is that they, to me they're both, you can talk about Russia, okay, fine, talk about Russia, but where's the reporting on Saudi Arabia, for example?
[01:21:48.723 --> 01:21:52.906]  In the mainstream media, thanks for showing that by the way.
[01:21:52.926 --> 01:21:54.027]  I appreciate you getting the picture up.
[01:21:54.648 --> 01:21:55.088]  They're quick.
[01:21:55.348 --> 01:21:55.969]  They're really quick.
[01:21:56.309 --> 01:21:59.932]  Yeah, I want to go back to what you were saying, too, about the narrative-driven media.
[01:22:00.352 --> 01:22:10.280]  Because what I think is really clear, you point out, give a couple examples, and you say, well, this is a story, you know, showing somebody who is an immigrant, and they have family ties, and they're being thrown out.
[01:22:10.321 --> 01:22:12.662]  Here's somebody that's being thrown out because they were a violent criminal.
[01:22:13.003 --> 01:22:14.204]  Breitbart's going to cover that story.
[01:22:14.224 --> 01:22:15.405]  CNN's going to cover the first story.
[01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:23.494]  Part of what I think is going on here, too, is the fact that CNN wants to say, we're not narrative-driven, we're simply objective.
[01:22:23.594 --> 01:22:33.366]  And that's what Google is doing for them, and that's what the scam that Google is doing to all of us, saying, we're going to just put these articles up here based on what people are looking for.
[01:22:33.746 --> 01:22:34.826]  And that's not the case.
[01:22:35.207 --> 01:22:44.970]  Google is going out there and using political terms to uprate certain sites and certain stories and to downrate others based on a political agenda.
[01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:49.672]  And so to me the issue is, are people going to be honest with you about what their bias is?
[01:22:49.732 --> 01:22:50.733]  Everybody's got a bias.
[01:22:51.033 --> 01:22:56.115]  And always in the past we would see the same stories put out by ABC, CBS, NBC.
[01:22:56.155 --> 01:22:59.236]  They would all choose to report the same stories and they would have the same angle.
[01:22:59.736 --> 01:23:03.457]  Now we have people who are coming out with a different narrative.
[01:23:03.537 --> 01:23:05.557]  We report the facts and we analyze the facts.
[01:23:05.917 --> 01:23:12.439]  CNN reports the facts, they analyze the facts, but they tell you that their facts are the only facts, that they don't have an opinion.
[01:23:12.859 --> 01:23:18.340]  And you have to understand that people exercise their opinion, just in your example, as to which story they're going to even report.
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:22.421]  They could be totally factual, but that shows you that they have a bias right there.
[01:23:22.981 --> 01:23:28.126]  That is the, that is the prime, so let's talk about the choices you make as a journalist, okay?
[01:23:28.507 --> 01:23:31.750]  The first choice you make is whether to cover a story or not.
[01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:33.311]  What do I cover today?
[01:23:33.351 --> 01:23:35.213]  Do I talk about Saudi Arabia or Russia?
[01:23:35.233 --> 01:23:38.256]  Do I talk about this murder or that murder?
[01:23:38.356 --> 01:23:39.157]  Does that make sense?
[01:23:39.177 --> 01:23:40.078]  That's story number one.
[01:23:40.639 --> 01:23:42.701]  That's choice number one you make as a journalist.
[01:23:42.801 --> 01:23:44.342]  Every journalist, every editor,
[01:23:45.143 --> 01:23:47.405]  Choice number two is the headline.
[01:23:48.026 --> 01:23:48.346]  Okay?
[01:23:48.667 --> 01:23:50.749]  You can get bias right in the headline.
[01:23:50.769 --> 01:23:51.730]  Okay?
[01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:56.454]  Choice number three is where you choose to place facts in the story.
[01:23:56.975 --> 01:24:00.758]  So, you can put a fact lower down in the story.
[01:24:01.829 --> 01:24:04.450]  And de-emphasize it, or you can put it up top.
[01:24:05.011 --> 01:24:10.854]  Every morning, David, I listen to National Public Radio, Fox News, and the BBC.
[01:24:10.894 --> 01:24:12.735]  I listen to all three of them.
[01:24:13.135 --> 01:24:16.497]  And the reason why is I try to get a balanced media diet.
[01:24:16.577 --> 01:24:23.000]  Then I also check, I check InfoWars, I check Breitbart, but I check Slate, I check the Huffington Post.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.121]  And here's why.
[01:24:24.141 --> 01:24:26.082]  I don't trust any of y'all.
[01:24:27.555 --> 01:24:29.096]  I also do it for entertainment value.
[01:24:29.136 --> 01:24:31.577]  I get a lot of entertainment out of looking at Slate and Huffington Post.
[01:24:31.597 --> 01:24:33.919]  They're always good from my standpoint.
[01:24:34.379 --> 01:24:39.462]  They are, but on some stories, I gotta say, here's the other thing I do as a journalist.
[01:24:40.322 --> 01:24:46.206]  If I see somebody reporting one thing, I look for the opposite.
[01:24:46.306 --> 01:24:47.547]  Let's take an example, right?
[01:24:47.987 --> 01:24:52.529]  This chemical attack that we're being told is by Bashar al-Assad, okay?
[01:24:55.493 --> 01:24:57.354]  I think most people just want to know the truth.
[01:24:58.014 --> 01:25:00.075]  Was it Bashar al-Assad or not?
[01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:05.596]  But the media, the mainstream media, is a hundred percent in it was Bashar al-Assad.
[01:25:06.036 --> 01:25:14.319]  Now, anybody who's done a little bit of independent research on this, just a little bit, can start to go, well, there seem to be some legitimate questions.
[01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:18.660]  We know the 2013 attack in Ghouta is very questionable, actually.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:20.760]  Etc, etc, right?
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:22.281]  And so what's happened is,
[01:25:22.921 --> 01:25:29.143]  The mainstream media likes to declare sites like Infowars and Breitbart verboten.
[01:25:29.163 --> 01:25:31.403]  You're not allowed, and Sputnik too, verboten.
[01:25:31.423 --> 01:25:32.603]  Don't listen to them.
[01:25:33.264 --> 01:25:38.565]  And Alex Jones is nuts, but Keith Olbermann is passionate.
[01:25:39.185 --> 01:25:39.425]  Right?
[01:25:39.525 --> 01:25:40.345]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:40.865 --> 01:25:41.065]  Right?
[01:25:41.445 --> 01:25:43.026]  And so what I'm saying is,
[01:25:45.528 --> 01:25:48.072]  Alex didn't invent being animated.
[01:25:48.092 --> 01:25:51.576]  I don't know how else to put it, but he's not the first guy.
[01:25:51.837 --> 01:25:55.482]  Chris Matthews can be pretty animated.
[01:25:55.822 --> 01:25:57.985]  Yeah, he gets that throw up and down his leg.
[01:25:58.986 --> 01:26:01.007]  That's exactly right, that's exactly right.
[01:26:01.568 --> 01:26:09.952]  And so what I'm saying is, what they want to do is they want to put people in a box and Milo at Breitbart was not the first guy to be provoked.
[01:26:10.192 --> 01:26:12.114]  Who's more provocative, Bill Maher or Milo?
[01:26:12.154 --> 01:26:13.054]  I don't know, you know what I mean?
[01:26:13.214 --> 01:26:13.714]  Right.
[01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:16.296]  People, there's different things.
[01:26:16.816 --> 01:26:26.942]  I think the key is, and this is what's making the mainstream media nuts, every time I talk to people in the new media, you or people from Breitbart or whoever,
[01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:30.433]  And I talk about people can make up their own minds.
[01:26:31.474 --> 01:26:32.655]  And people can figure it out.
[01:26:32.895 --> 01:26:33.195]  I can.
[01:26:33.476 --> 01:26:33.936]  You can.
[01:26:33.956 --> 01:26:34.737]  I can, David.
[01:26:35.178 --> 01:26:36.399]  And all of the audience can.
[01:26:36.539 --> 01:26:38.181]  I can look at a New York Times story.
[01:26:39.366 --> 01:26:42.368]  And I know what their bias is, and I can filter that in.
[01:26:42.408 --> 01:26:49.051]  I can look at an Infowars story and I know where it comes from, and I can filter that out, and I can make up my own damn mind.
[01:26:49.612 --> 01:26:50.772]  That's what's scary to them.
[01:26:51.273 --> 01:26:53.894]  They're frightened to death that we can make up our own minds.
[01:26:54.234 --> 01:27:02.059]  And the wake-up call for them was Donald Trump being elected, because whatever you thought about Donald Trump, he wasn't supposed to win, right?
[01:27:02.459 --> 01:27:03.420]  He was supposed to lose.
[01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:07.202]  And that's when they realized the genie's out of the bottle.
[01:27:07.842 --> 01:27:09.603]  And they can no longer control us.
[01:27:11.784 --> 01:27:15.647]  It's almost like there's an info war going on.
[01:27:18.894 --> 01:27:19.755]  Almost like that, right?
[01:27:19.975 --> 01:27:22.496]  And it's almost as if... I thought that phrase just occurred to me.
[01:27:24.057 --> 01:27:25.918]  You know, they talk about the election being hacked.
[01:27:25.938 --> 01:27:30.281]  What they're upset about is that, for the first time, they didn't control the entire narrative.
[01:27:30.481 --> 01:27:32.562]  You know, you're talking about how you look at different sources and everything.
[01:27:32.602 --> 01:27:40.547]  Back in the day when there were magazines that I turned to for information before the internet, I used to have subscriptions to a lot of different magazines.
[01:27:40.607 --> 01:27:44.690]  I had Time, I had Newsweek, I had The Nation, I had National Review.
[01:27:45.490 --> 01:27:48.711]  I gave up on Time and Newsweek because I didn't like it.
[01:27:48.751 --> 01:27:49.671]  They were dishonest.
[01:27:49.751 --> 01:27:54.093]  They said, oh, we're totally objective, and it was pretty bland and disinteresting.
[01:27:54.233 --> 01:27:57.494]  I chose the people who had a passionate point of view.
[01:27:57.534 --> 01:28:01.615]  They would give you the facts, and then they would argue from a point of view, and they were honest about that.
[01:28:01.935 --> 01:28:07.636]  The Nation's coming at you from the left, and the National Review's coming at you from the right, but they're honest about where they're coming from.
[01:28:07.717 --> 01:28:08.857]  What I can't tolerate.
[01:28:09.557 --> 01:28:13.018]  Is this idea that somehow CNN doesn't have an agenda.
[01:28:13.078 --> 01:28:16.679]  CNN doesn't have a bias with the stories that they pick or the angles that they pick on it.
[01:28:17.019 --> 01:28:18.559]  Which is what you talked about from the very beginning.
[01:28:18.779 --> 01:28:20.560]  That's the thing that I think is very disturbing.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:28.722]  But I think it's also interesting how YouTube and Google are moving against people also financially.
[01:28:29.102 --> 01:28:33.503]  You know, putting up a boycott saying, well, our advertisers are twisting our arms on this.
[01:28:33.883 --> 01:28:40.765]  We just had this story from the New York Times that was on Drudge Report yesterday, how YouTube's shifting algorithms hurt independent media.
[01:28:40.785 --> 01:28:49.367]  And they've got a guy, 21 years old, he's got 350,000 subscribers, and all of a sudden his YouTube revenue went down to six cents.
[01:28:50.548 --> 01:28:53.730]  And one day, basically forcing him out of business.
[01:28:53.850 --> 01:28:54.170]  Why?
[01:28:54.490 --> 01:28:55.931]  He didn't do anything profane.
[01:28:56.371 --> 01:28:57.892]  He didn't do anything that was violent.
[01:28:58.353 --> 01:29:02.135]  Everything that he did on his channel conformed to broadcast standards.
[01:29:02.676 --> 01:29:05.477]  But YouTube labeled him as being controversial.
[01:29:05.678 --> 01:29:12.862]  So now we've taken, you know, another step away from, well, it's true or it's false or it's fake or whatever, and they're going to be the arbiters of that.
[01:29:13.263 --> 01:29:18.546]  Now they're going to be the arbiters of what is controversial, and they do it in the name of their advertisers.
[01:29:18.926 --> 01:29:19.307]  How's that?
[01:29:19.927 --> 01:29:22.730]  And I think it's a massively dumb commercial.
[01:29:23.210 --> 01:29:29.215]  YouTube is creating right now a market opportunity for someone to come along.
[01:29:29.676 --> 01:29:33.799]  I don't know if they've heard of this, but apparently controversy is popular.
[01:29:33.819 --> 01:29:38.404]  They should look into Howard Stern and Madonna going back.
[01:29:38.524 --> 01:29:39.525]  I'm dating myself.
[01:29:41.306 --> 01:29:41.566]  Right?
[01:29:41.766 --> 01:29:42.006]  Yeah.
[01:29:42.046 --> 01:29:47.209]  But as long as I've been alive, controversy has been popular.
[01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:58.476]  And the fact is, again, they're creating, you know, God bless capitalism, YouTube is creating a market opportunity for someone to come in and take all their money.
[01:29:59.056 --> 01:30:04.900]  Because the fact is, advertisers at the end of the day want eyeballs, and they don't want people who are
[01:30:08.996 --> 01:30:10.197]  Legitimately hateful.
[01:30:10.878 --> 01:30:11.698]  I'll put it like that.
[01:30:12.739 --> 01:30:15.562]  Not fake hateful, but legitimately hateful.
[01:30:17.003 --> 01:30:29.515]  That being said, well, I say that they don't want people who are legitimately hateful, but then, I don't know, advertisers seem to still be on Saturday Night Live, so maybe I'm missing something.
[01:30:30.555 --> 01:30:33.676]  Okay, let's take it from there, because you're talking about Saturday Night Live.
[01:30:34.196 --> 01:30:38.397]  And as we look at these different narratives that they put out, let's switch over now to Bannon.
[01:30:38.857 --> 01:30:44.578]  Because he was singled out, and they focused on him for a week, and then they culminated.
[01:30:44.598 --> 01:30:45.918]  That was the mainstream media's narrative.
[01:30:46.238 --> 01:30:53.900]  Oh, he's awful, but he's really smart, and he's Trump's brain trying to drive a wedge, and they did it very successfully between him and Donald Trump.
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:54.740]  At the end of the week,
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:31:03.147]  Saturday Night Live does a skit with Bannon, again trying to portray him as the evil genius behind Donald Trump, and it seemed to be successful.
[01:31:03.828 --> 01:31:14.737]  On Monday morning, an hour after you had Morning Joe replay the Saturday Night Live skit, pouring scorn on Trump and making fun of him and using Bannon to do that,
[01:31:15.638 --> 01:31:20.041]  He tweeted out, I'm my own boss, and that sort of thing, and now it seems to be moving in that direction.
[01:31:20.261 --> 01:31:30.268]  It's a great example of how they single out an individual and destroy them, but tell us what you think is happening within the White House wars, because we've seen a lot of
[01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:40.692]  A lot of press about what's going on between Kushner and Ivanka and Rex Tillerson, bringing in Gary Cohen and the Goldman Sachs people, and then Steve Bannon on the other side.
[01:31:41.152 --> 01:31:44.953]  They now want to say, well, he's out, and they're trying to push him out in every way that they can.
[01:31:44.973 --> 01:31:50.755]  And it seems like from the tweets that we got from Donald Trump that their wedge is seeming to work.
[01:31:51.826 --> 01:32:01.171]  Well, yeah, it has, and I've been reporting on this for a couple of weeks now, specifically talking about Dina Powell, who very few people have written about before I started talking.
[01:32:01.191 --> 01:32:02.612]  I did a Periscope a couple weeks ago.
[01:32:03.212 --> 01:32:07.714]  I wrote about Gary Cohn about a month and a half ago at Breitbart when I was there.
[01:32:09.727 --> 01:32:16.676]  I'm a big advocate of Steve's, but more importantly, and I like Steve personally, and he hired me, but when I work for Breitbart.
[01:32:16.716 --> 01:32:20.421]  That being said, this is not about Steve Bannon or about one person.
[01:32:20.781 --> 01:32:23.785]  This is about the ideology that Donald Trump was elected on.
[01:32:23.906 --> 01:32:24.466]  Exactly.
[01:32:24.486 --> 01:32:25.127]  Period.
[01:32:25.868 --> 01:32:26.930]  This is about ideas.
[01:32:27.491 --> 01:32:30.656]  This is not about Bannon being pushed out because someone doesn't like him.
[01:32:30.676 --> 01:32:37.967]  This is about the ideas of populist nationalism, which I think represents a legitimate third way in American politics.
[01:32:38.288 --> 01:32:40.070]  So it's freaking everybody out, okay?
[01:32:41.252 --> 01:32:49.856]  And let me say this, Lee, because I think the real issue here is, as Donald Trump pointed out, look, he was on these issues before he met Bannon and so forth.
[01:32:49.916 --> 01:32:56.658]  It isn't that Bannon came in and Donald Trump was in this position on the issues and Bannon completely turned him around to something else.
[01:32:56.758 --> 01:32:58.819]  Bannon was helping him move forward with his agenda.
[01:32:59.039 --> 01:33:06.582]  The people who are there now are the ones who are taking over Trump and pushing him in a different direction than he campaigned and that he won on.
[01:33:06.843 --> 01:33:07.683]  That's the reality.
[01:33:07.723 --> 01:33:09.884]  They're the ones who are his brain who are taking him over.
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:13.802]  Well, I have a piece up at thepopulist.us right now.
[01:33:13.862 --> 01:33:14.903]  It's that Ivanka piece.
[01:33:14.983 --> 01:33:16.564]  It's the cover story right now.
[01:33:17.524 --> 01:33:22.528]  And I'm doing something that's kind of different journalistically at The Populist, which is we're listening.
[01:33:22.588 --> 01:33:31.994]  But that story with Ivanka up there at the top, this is a big deal because... She partied with Trump haters prior to the inauguration.
[01:33:32.174 --> 01:33:35.256]  She did, and it's completely vetted.
[01:33:35.416 --> 01:33:37.978]  It's just a very factual layout.
[01:33:38.718 --> 01:33:39.198]  of the story.
[01:33:39.218 --> 01:33:40.099]  It's not a big narrative.
[01:33:40.139 --> 01:33:43.981]  It's a very factual layout with everybody linked who was at this party.
[01:33:44.522 --> 01:33:50.265]  She had a private dinner party that was hosted at the wife of Rupert Murdoch's house.
[01:33:50.646 --> 01:33:55.769]  The person who put it together was Dina Powell for people to give Ivanka Trump advice.
[01:33:56.409 --> 01:34:00.492]  One of the people there was the editor of Time Magazine.
[01:34:01.633 --> 01:34:02.573]  Now let's go over this.
[01:34:02.593 --> 01:34:03.914]  It's a woman, Maggie Gray.
[01:34:03.934 --> 01:34:05.315]  She's the editor of Time Magazine.
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:11.543]  Time Magazine did a cover story on Steve Bannon.
[01:34:12.624 --> 01:34:15.766]  That cover was part of what drove the wedge.
[01:34:16.666 --> 01:34:20.309]  Now, Maggie Gray, when you look at the list of people who is
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:22.221]  Who was at this party?
[01:34:22.922 --> 01:34:28.046]  They are all, with one exception, what I couldn't find any political information about.
[01:34:28.707 --> 01:34:33.612]  Everybody else is literally a Hillary supporter, Tory Burch, and Trump haters.
[01:34:33.972 --> 01:34:38.877]  Maggie Gray, from Time, is very adamant she does not like Trump, okay?
[01:34:39.237 --> 01:34:42.840]  So if the argument is, well, we were trying to make the press like us, that didn't work.
[01:34:43.281 --> 01:34:44.042]  But I'm convinced
[01:34:44.782 --> 01:34:46.144]  Hang on, Lee, we gotta take a quick break.
[01:34:46.164 --> 01:34:47.985]  We're gonna be right back with Lee Stranahan.
[01:34:48.466 --> 01:34:50.828]  And you can find him at thepopulist.us.
[01:34:50.968 --> 01:34:53.350]  That's where you can see that article that he just pointed out.
[01:34:53.370 --> 01:34:53.971]  We'll be right back.
[01:34:54.191 --> 01:34:54.611]  Stay with us.
[01:35:01.457 --> 01:35:03.039]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[01:35:04.008 --> 01:35:16.020]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:21.185]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies.
[01:35:21.506 --> 01:35:22.346]  You look them up for yourself.
[01:35:23.027 --> 01:35:32.732]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[01:35:32.872 --> 01:35:39.015]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[01:35:39.896 --> 01:35:41.757]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[01:35:42.737 --> 01:35:43.978]  People are falling apart.
[01:35:44.018 --> 01:35:45.018]  They're totally depressed.
[01:35:45.038 --> 01:35:45.578]  They're unhappy.
[01:35:46.159 --> 01:35:47.139]  What is going on?
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:52.282]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[01:35:53.496 --> 01:35:56.057]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[01:35:56.457 --> 01:35:58.118]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:35:58.358 --> 01:36:05.382]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:36:05.602 --> 01:36:13.926]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWarsLife products.
[01:36:15.325 --> 01:36:21.851]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[01:36:22.211 --> 01:36:25.634]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:36:25.675 --> 01:36:28.797]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[01:36:29.398 --> 01:36:34.483]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:36:35.003 --> 01:36:38.164]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[01:36:38.464 --> 01:36:48.889]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[01:36:48.989 --> 01:36:50.449]  The bone is so amazing.
[01:36:50.850 --> 01:36:56.452]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[01:36:57.574 --> 01:37:00.496]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[01:37:01.036 --> 01:37:06.479]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[01:37:06.759 --> 01:37:16.223]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[01:37:16.504 --> 01:37:21.066]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[01:37:21.306 --> 01:37:23.087]  This is a absolute win-win.
[01:37:23.147 --> 01:37:25.927]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[01:37:26.208 --> 01:37:32.329]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[01:37:33.610 --> 01:37:42.393]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:37:42.513 --> 01:37:46.914]  Three years in the making, incredible research and the very best ingredients.
[01:37:47.434 --> 01:37:50.035]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[01:37:50.742 --> 01:37:54.045]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[01:37:54.425 --> 01:37:57.908]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[01:38:02.192 --> 01:38:03.533]  You found it.
[01:38:03.573 --> 01:38:05.255]  The tip of the spear.
[01:38:05.395 --> 01:38:08.438]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[01:38:21.118 --> 01:38:23.919]  Thanks, CJ, for putting that together, and what a day to play that.
[01:38:24.259 --> 01:38:26.699]  Taxed to the max, and we can't get the facts.
[01:38:26.879 --> 01:38:28.900]  They just tell us what they think we ought to know.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:29.760]  That's Tower of Power.
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:31.400]  We're talking to Lee Stranahan.
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:32.500]  We're going to get right back to Lee.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:36.141]  Of course, you can find him at ThePopulist.us.
[01:38:36.321 --> 01:38:37.801]  Populist.us.
[01:38:38.222 --> 01:38:41.402]  He also is co-host of Fault Lines on Sputnik.
[01:38:41.462 --> 01:38:43.623]  He's worked for many years for Breitbart.
[01:38:43.763 --> 01:38:45.323]  He was hired by Andrew Breitbart.
[01:38:45.343 --> 01:38:46.103]  He knows Steve Bannon.
[01:38:46.123 --> 01:38:50.124]  We're talking about what's going on in the White House, the wars that are going on there.
[01:38:50.804 --> 01:39:04.152]  Before we get back to Lee, and Lee I'd like to keep you into the next segment if that's possible, but before we get back to Lee I just want to remind you that we have our Easter Mega Special that will be ending tonight at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:39:04.212 --> 01:39:13.517]  It's one of the ways that you can support us as Google moves to demonetize anybody that doesn't follow their narrative, their government narrative.
[01:39:14.238 --> 01:39:18.820]  So we have 25% off Super Male, Super Female Vitality, both of those are 25% off.
[01:39:20.461 --> 01:39:21.702]  25% off Secret 12.
[01:39:21.762 --> 01:39:24.183]  That's our Vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:39:24.203 --> 01:39:26.164]  You just put a little bit of that under your tongue.
[01:39:26.204 --> 01:39:30.906]  You don't have to get an injection to get the same effect as a B12 injection.
[01:39:30.986 --> 01:39:32.927]  Also, Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:39:32.967 --> 01:39:42.392]  That's a drink mix that gives you a large selection of minerals and vitamins in a very easy to take liquid formulation so you don't have to swallow a lot of pills.
[01:39:42.412 --> 01:39:43.492]  That's 25% off.
[01:39:43.572 --> 01:39:45.153]  And 30% off Brain Force.
[01:39:45.253 --> 01:39:47.694]  These sales will be ending tonight.
[01:39:49.915 --> 01:39:51.296]  So I just want to remind that to you.
[01:39:51.316 --> 01:39:57.222]  And also, as we sell out of nascent iodine, it's getting very difficult for us to secure that deep earth iodine supply.
[01:39:57.262 --> 01:40:00.184]  So it may be a while before we can get that resupplied.
[01:40:00.204 --> 01:40:02.907]  So take advantage of that now, while it's 25% off.
[01:40:02.947 --> 01:40:04.188]  We appreciate your support.
[01:40:04.928 --> 01:40:06.490]  That is what funds our operation.
[01:40:07.110 --> 01:40:10.473]  And at the time that we have, at a time when
[01:40:11.434 --> 01:40:27.803]  Google is blocking our ads from being placed on sites and then blocking us from being able to run ads on YouTube as you see this New York Times story talk about this as they try to bland everything down into a non-controversial media format.
[01:40:28.243 --> 01:40:34.446]  That is a very important thing for you to support us and we really do appreciate you standing with us and standing behind us.
[01:40:34.526 --> 01:40:35.747]  We need that support.
[01:40:36.138 --> 01:40:51.075]  Let's go back to Lee and Lee you were talking about what was going on you said you got a story that's up at thepopulist.us which is talking about how Ivanka Trump partied with inauguration before the inauguration with a bunch of never Trumpers and how these people
[01:40:52.210 --> 01:40:53.031]  Work their way inside.
[01:40:53.051 --> 01:41:05.742]  I said as we were looking at the election, you know, we have a situation where if you have a landslide election, election for somebody like Donald Trump, I believed that they would step aside and then try to take over the White House after the fact.
[01:41:06.042 --> 01:41:10.306]  And as we see these advisers that are being put into the White House, that appears to be what's going on.
[01:41:10.686 --> 01:41:13.208]  It's not Steve Bannon who is manipulating Trump.
[01:41:13.329 --> 01:41:18.013]  It is these new advisers like Gary Cohen who are working against the agenda
[01:41:18.553 --> 01:41:27.986]  That Trump had, that Bannon helped him to win on, and that, as Steve Bannon pointed out, if they deliver on that agenda, we will change the US for the better for a generation.
[01:41:28.026 --> 01:41:34.595]  But if we don't, it's going to blow back in a very, very bad way for freedom and for nationalism.
[01:41:35.393 --> 01:41:38.074]  Well, and I also want to just correct something I said last time.
[01:41:38.094 --> 01:41:39.675]  I was talking about the Editor of Time.
[01:41:39.695 --> 01:41:42.436]  The Editor of Time is Nancy Gibbs.
[01:41:42.596 --> 01:41:43.917]  Forgive me, I said another name.
[01:41:43.957 --> 01:41:45.418]  The Editor of Time is Nancy Gibbs.
[01:41:46.098 --> 01:41:49.300]  I just did that, David, because I wanted to show people an example.
[01:41:50.259 --> 01:41:50.559]  Of course.
[01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:15.341]  Do you think the media is going to get nicer to Donald Trump?
[01:42:15.461 --> 01:42:24.886]  And Steve said, I'm paraphrasing, but Steve basically said, if you think the establishment is going to give up their power and money, you're crazy.
[01:42:24.946 --> 01:42:26.006]  That's not going to happen.
[01:42:26.126 --> 01:42:26.567]  That's right.
[01:42:26.647 --> 01:42:28.488]  It's an ongoing war.
[01:42:28.628 --> 01:42:32.810]  We've got a short break here, and we're going to come right back after the break.
[01:42:32.850 --> 01:42:33.330]  Stay with us.
[01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:35.091]  We're talking to Lee Stranahan.
[01:42:35.131 --> 01:42:35.812]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:42.482 --> 01:42:45.830]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:48.115]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:42:51.064 --> 01:42:52.985]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[01:42:53.045 --> 01:42:54.105]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:42:54.366 --> 01:42:55.286]  Why is this so good?
[01:42:55.586 --> 01:43:00.829]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:43:00.909 --> 01:43:14.455]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:43:14.515 --> 01:43:15.896]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:43:16.656 --> 01:43:18.238]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:43:18.318 --> 01:43:20.821]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:43:20.901 --> 01:43:22.163]  These are all parasites.
[01:43:22.223 --> 01:43:23.304]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:43:23.324 --> 01:43:24.365]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:43:24.666 --> 01:43:29.011]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:43:29.211 --> 01:43:32.395]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:43:32.455 --> 01:43:35.537]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:43:35.557 --> 01:43:36.577]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:43:36.617 --> 01:43:37.158]  Living Defense.
[01:43:37.458 --> 01:43:38.498]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:43:38.558 --> 01:43:39.579]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:43:39.599 --> 01:43:41.680]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:44.181]  And you support the broadcast.
[01:43:44.241 --> 01:43:45.322]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:43:45.602 --> 01:43:47.483]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:43:47.863 --> 01:43:49.864]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:43:52.306 --> 01:43:56.408]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:43:56.928 --> 01:43:58.229]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:44:04.206 --> 01:44:05.527]  We are on the march.
[01:44:05.908 --> 01:44:08.310]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:44:09.071 --> 01:44:12.855]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:44:18.561 --> 01:44:19.042]  Welcome back.
[01:44:19.122 --> 01:44:20.924]  We're talking to Lee Stranahan.
[01:44:20.964 --> 01:44:23.647]  You can find him on Twitter at Stranahan.
[01:44:24.207 --> 01:44:26.250]  And as we're going to the break, Lee was saying
[01:44:27.421 --> 01:44:30.443]  That Steve Bannon said, of course they're going to continue to fight.
[01:44:30.723 --> 01:44:33.666]  And we saw them focus on, fight him first, quite frankly.
[01:44:34.566 --> 01:44:41.591]  As the New York Times article pointed out, nothing made Karl Rove's stomach not, like the nickname they gave him, Bush's brain.
[01:44:42.172 --> 01:44:52.339]  They know how to drive a wedge between people and they have really focused on Bannon to drive that wedge against him so they can change the agenda, so they can change the ideology
[01:44:52.799 --> 01:44:54.860]  Well, it is exactly the establishment, globalist, internationalist,
[01:45:09.406 --> 01:45:09.886]  I think so.
[01:45:31.053 --> 01:45:31.313]  Right?
[01:45:31.573 --> 01:45:32.193]  Yes.
[01:45:32.513 --> 01:45:37.515]  They're both connected to Gary Cohn, a registered Democrat.
[01:45:37.855 --> 01:45:45.657]  Dina Powell is a Republican who worked in the Bush administration, whose ex-husband was a president at Teneo.
[01:45:46.097 --> 01:45:51.398]  Teneo's the company, Doug Bann's company, that's connected to the Clinton Foundation.
[01:45:52.979 --> 01:45:56.860]  And Huma Abedin, who's Hillary Clinton's top assistant,
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:00.361]  Worked for, by the way, who's Huma Abedin friends with?
[01:46:00.861 --> 01:46:02.502]  I wrote about this at Breitbart last year.
[01:46:02.522 --> 01:46:03.502]  Ivanka Trump.
[01:46:03.722 --> 01:46:05.542]  Who else is Ivanka Trump friends with?
[01:46:05.903 --> 01:46:06.703]  Chelsea Clinton.
[01:46:07.283 --> 01:46:13.805]  Now, does any of this mean, is this just guilt by association?
[01:46:14.025 --> 01:46:14.745]  What does this mean?
[01:46:15.245 --> 01:46:15.966]  Here's what it means.
[01:46:16.426 --> 01:46:20.387]  These are people who are marinating in the swamp, okay?
[01:46:20.507 --> 01:46:23.488]  These are people who, Dina Powell,
[01:46:24.992 --> 01:46:27.574]  And let's call her Dina Habib Powell.
[01:46:27.715 --> 01:46:32.018]  Everybody is dropping the middle name because it points out her Egyptian origins.
[01:46:32.459 --> 01:46:40.146]  But, you know, she was brought in and last summer we had the Washington Post talking about Ivanka Trump and they said
[01:46:40.886 --> 01:46:43.209]  Uh, she sounds like she's supporting Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:43.489 --> 01:46:46.993]  Because on all these women's issues, she sounds exactly like Hillary Clinton.
[01:46:47.013 --> 01:46:49.255]  Well, who was advising her on the women's issues?
[01:46:49.295 --> 01:46:56.343]  It was Dina Habib Powell was advising her on the women's issues, and now she's on the National Security Council as they push General Flynn out.
[01:46:57.028 --> 01:46:58.748]  That's... and push Steve Bannon out.
[01:46:58.808 --> 01:46:59.609]  Yes, yes.
[01:46:59.929 --> 01:47:01.169]  As they brought up Steve Bannon.
[01:47:01.509 --> 01:47:07.010]  And right before we dropped missiles on Syria for something that was not proven.
[01:47:07.450 --> 01:47:07.790]  Yes.
[01:47:08.010 --> 01:47:16.152]  I'm sorry that the origin of that attack, the people who reported it are pro-rebel, all the media came from pro-rebel groups.
[01:47:16.772 --> 01:47:26.134]  Anybody who's paid any attention to Syria, and I went over to Lebanon in 2013 myself to do the investigation, anybody who's paid any attention knows that these people lie and that
[01:47:26.894 --> 01:47:28.075]  Who are the bad guys in this?
[01:47:28.135 --> 01:47:30.377]  Is it the Democrats like Barack Obama?
[01:47:30.417 --> 01:47:30.877]  Yes.
[01:47:31.277 --> 01:47:33.139]  Is it Republicans like John McCain?
[01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:34.500]  Yes.
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.060]  Right.
[01:47:35.901 --> 01:47:43.467]  And so when you have people like, I refer to John McCain and Lindsey Graham as the ambiguously Republican duo.
[01:47:44.007 --> 01:47:48.651]  When you have people like John McCain and Lindsey Graham,
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:03.323]  Suddenly coming out and praising Trump, I get a little nervous about that, I gotta say.
[01:48:03.483 --> 01:48:13.229]  Or Elliott Abrams, who comes out and says, now he's finally president, and then the next thing you see in the press from Elliott Abrams is, the first thing Trump's gotta do is get rid of Bannon.
[01:48:13.942 --> 01:48:18.404]  And for Reid's Atari, they've been trying to, look, and I write about this on The Populist.
[01:48:18.644 --> 01:48:23.446]  By the way, for anybody trying to find it, I've got to point out, you've got to put in the T-H-E, Populist.
[01:48:23.506 --> 01:48:26.667]  It's not Populist, it's the H-E, Populist, right?
[01:48:26.747 --> 01:48:27.287]  Yes.
[01:48:27.847 --> 01:48:33.950]  So, if you go to The Populist, I have another piece up there where I go through the timeline
[01:48:34.890 --> 01:48:37.231]  Of how these people came into power.
[01:48:37.311 --> 01:48:39.831]  I go, I go, I'm doing something a little different.
[01:48:39.871 --> 01:48:42.992]  I'm not doing stories exactly in some cases.
[01:48:43.012 --> 01:48:44.032]  And that's very important.
[01:48:44.092 --> 01:48:45.072]  People need to understand.
[01:48:45.452 --> 01:48:50.033]  I was concerned about the direction this administration was headed when I started seeing the people who were being brought in.
[01:48:50.493 --> 01:48:51.293]  It has an effect.
[01:48:51.313 --> 01:48:53.214]  This isn't just inside politics, folks.
[01:48:53.234 --> 01:48:55.154]  This isn't just gossip or Game of Thrones.
[01:48:55.394 --> 01:48:56.614]  It has real consequences.
[01:48:56.975 --> 01:48:57.335]  Stay with us.
[01:48:57.355 --> 01:48:58.835]  We're going to be right back with Lee Stranahan.
[01:49:01.567 --> 01:49:03.328]  You provided Alex with the caveman?
[01:49:03.348 --> 01:49:04.448]  I hear you're okay in Jiu Jitsu.
[01:49:19.413 --> 01:49:20.554]  No, no, I'm not.
[01:49:20.594 --> 01:49:21.235]  I'm terrible.
[01:49:21.255 --> 01:49:21.835]  I'm terrible.
[01:49:21.935 --> 01:49:29.082]  But, the point is that I have a lot of aches and shoulders and, you know, this weird joint stuff that I've had issues with for years.
[01:49:29.683 --> 01:49:36.910]  And this bone broth, the Caveman Bone Broth, along with our joint formula has just worked magic for me.
[01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:40.434]  And that's just, you know, that's just from my personal experience.
[01:49:41.795 --> 01:49:47.058]  I think they're great products and I think if anybody else has those issues that you should definitely, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
[01:49:47.078 --> 01:49:50.180]  If I'm wrong, then hey man, write me a mean letter.
[01:49:50.561 --> 01:49:51.862]  But let me tell you, they work for me.
[01:49:52.242 --> 01:49:53.443]  Yeah, they work for me too.
[01:49:53.523 --> 01:49:54.643]  Actually, we were talking about this earlier.
[01:49:54.663 --> 01:50:01.848]  Dude and I play basketball and I'm just now, like for the first time in my life, I'm 27 now, after I play basketball my knees are barking.
[01:50:02.448 --> 01:50:10.036]  So, but the bone broth and the joint formula, like you just said, you combine those two, I felt the difference immediately.
[01:50:10.096 --> 01:50:11.797]  I felt it immediately.
[01:50:11.817 --> 01:50:14.060]  Yeah, and it actually tastes good.
[01:50:14.140 --> 01:50:17.203]  Like, I'm really picky and I will drink it.
[01:50:17.283 --> 01:50:18.384]  It tastes good to me.
[01:50:18.484 --> 01:50:22.428]  I love chocolate, so I really like the flavor of the Caveman.
[01:50:22.468 --> 01:50:24.510]  So, I mean, if the bone broth...
[01:50:28.332 --> 01:50:33.474]  If the bone broth is really that gross, I mean, I would never have known because it tastes really good.
[01:50:33.494 --> 01:50:37.235]  And my favorite is the Super Female Vitality.
[01:50:37.276 --> 01:50:45.038]  So ladies, get yourself some Super Female Vitality if you haven't already because it seriously, it just gets me going.
[01:50:45.098 --> 01:50:50.280]  I mean, I'll take a whole bunch of that stuff before I go out and do my... Maybe get it for your wife then, too, or girlfriend.
[01:50:51.001 --> 01:50:56.990]  I go and take a bunch of it before I go do Man on the Street and I just start running, zipping around, running right into the action.
[01:50:57.010 --> 01:50:58.292]  No fear, nothing.
[01:50:59.258 --> 01:51:06.600]  Well, that's a big primary part about, you know, fighting the globalists is making sure that we stay healthy and stay clear-eyed and stay honest and stay humble.
[01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:08.981]  I hope that we do that here at InfoWars.
[01:51:09.681 --> 01:51:20.224]  We got a lot going on and we're in the middle of the fight, so we really appreciate it when anybody supports us either by purchasing our products or you can even go on to our store and donate.
[01:51:20.284 --> 01:51:21.524]  We're doing this by the skin of our teeth.
[01:51:21.584 --> 01:51:27.686]  I know it looks like we're in a billion-dollar studio, but Alex has never taken one cent of
[01:51:28.946 --> 01:51:31.187]  A borrowed money at all whatsoever.
[01:51:31.227 --> 01:51:33.408]  This is all money that's come from you listeners.
[01:51:33.448 --> 01:51:41.532]  So you've literally built this place, you know, built this place with your compassion and built this place with the support that you've sent us.
[01:51:41.552 --> 01:51:44.893]  So from the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it because I know we wouldn't be able to do this.
[01:51:44.933 --> 01:51:47.774]  We wouldn't have a voice if it wasn't for you.
[01:51:47.874 --> 01:51:53.257]  So once again, we got to thank the listeners for their steadfastness in supporting us and
[01:51:53.957 --> 01:52:00.836]  Even when we make mistakes and even when we're not right and even when we might go a little bit crazy, you guys stick with us and I appreciate that.
[01:52:18.783 --> 01:52:23.229]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:52:23.849 --> 01:52:25.271]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:52:35.939 --> 01:52:37.220]  And it helps fund our operation.
[01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:39.421]  At least if a lot of people take advantage of the sale, then it does.
[01:52:40.842 --> 01:52:47.205]  If we have a big sale and cut prices down to almost no profit, and then people don't take advantage of it, then we actually lose money.
[01:52:47.465 --> 01:52:50.247]  We need to fund ourselves, fund this operation.

[01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:30.042]  We should get more in the next few weeks.

[01:53:55.322 --> 01:53:56.863]  It's a win-win-win-win-win.
[01:53:57.163 --> 01:53:58.304]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:53:58.404 --> 01:54:00.045]  Infowarsstore.com or 888.
[01:54:00.885 --> 01:54:06.670]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, let's now hand the baton to David Knight right here in the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:28.033]  And as Alex was just pointing out, that special that we had for Easter is ending tonight.
[01:54:28.073 --> 01:54:32.936]  And that's 25 to 30% off a wide selection of products that he just pointed out there.
[01:54:32.956 --> 01:54:38.481]  30% off Brain Force, 25% off many of the other products that you'll find at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:54:39.021 --> 01:54:40.862]  We've been talking to Lee Stranahan.
[01:54:40.882 --> 01:54:42.684]  We have him for one more segment here.
[01:54:43.324 --> 01:54:48.908]  Lee, we were talking just before the break about how this is not just court intrigue.
[01:54:48.949 --> 01:54:50.510]  This is not just political gossip.
[01:54:51.230 --> 01:54:52.291]  This is not a Game of Thrones.
[01:54:52.371 --> 01:54:54.672]  It has real consequences when these people are brought in.
[01:54:54.932 --> 01:54:58.013]  We see that Flynn was immediately removed from the National Security Council.
[01:54:58.333 --> 01:55:03.135]  As soon as Bannon was removed, as you pointed out, as many of us have pointed out, we had these attacks the next day.
[01:55:03.755 --> 01:55:04.756]  Who were they replaced by?
[01:55:04.816 --> 01:55:08.677]  McMasters and by Dina Habib Powell, a Goldman Sachs person.
[01:55:08.697 --> 01:55:12.479]  So we're seeing a change in the agenda that Donald Trump
[01:55:12.959 --> 01:55:16.881]  And that's going to happen when you've got advisors that are not with you.
[01:55:17.102 --> 01:55:25.106]  Advisors who did not campaign on the same agenda, but who were actually hardcore Democrats all their lives, always supporting Hillary Clinton.
[01:55:25.767 --> 01:55:28.568]  And I want people to understand, this is not 4-D chess.
[01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:33.191]  This is not keep your enemies, you know, friends close, keep your enemies closer.
[01:55:33.211 --> 01:55:33.611]  That's right.
[01:55:34.072 --> 01:55:35.573]  Let me explain what's happening here.
[01:55:35.633 --> 01:55:37.754]  This is from people inside the White House.
[01:55:38.434 --> 01:55:39.595]  It's not from Steve Bannon.
[01:55:39.635 --> 01:55:40.936]  I did not hear this from Steve Bannon.
[01:55:41.596 --> 01:55:52.766]  What will happen, and this has been going on for a couple of months now, is that they'll have policy meetings in the White House, and Jared and Ivanka would sit there quietly and observe the policy meetings, okay?
[01:55:53.406 --> 01:55:59.632]  Then, when the policy people leave, they stay, and then they talk to Trump.
[01:56:00.873 --> 01:56:01.333]  Follow me?
[01:56:01.554 --> 01:56:01.774]  Yeah.
[01:56:01.894 --> 01:56:06.698]  This is what's been happening, and this is directly from sources I have inside the White House, okay?
[01:56:08.126 --> 01:56:12.971]  And of course, Kushner brought in the architect of Obamacare.
[01:56:13.291 --> 01:56:14.552]  He brought him in multiple times.
[01:56:14.893 --> 01:56:17.655]  Rahm Emanuel's brother, Zeke Emanuel, the architect of Obamacare.
[01:56:18.056 --> 01:56:22.780]  Gary Cohn has brought in the guy who is the architect of TPP, and they're trying to push back against NAFTA.
[01:56:23.101 --> 01:56:30.668]  So they're coming at it from a traditional Democrat perspective, saying we're not going to repeal Obamacare, and we're not really going to do anything with NAFTA.
[01:56:30.748 --> 01:56:32.350]  Trump got TPP repealed.
[01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:37.351]  One of the first things he did, but what's going to happen at this point, after these people come in, that's the key thing.
[01:56:37.532 --> 01:56:41.413]  And we see the Washington Post saying, now they're moving to a centrist position.
[01:56:41.653 --> 01:56:42.433]  Oh, that's all good.
[01:56:42.713 --> 01:56:44.174]  They don't have an ideology.
[01:56:44.714 --> 01:56:45.294]  And moderate.
[01:56:45.414 --> 01:56:46.394]  Yeah, that's right, that's right.
[01:56:46.675 --> 01:57:00.019]  And the same thing we were talking about before, that you have these other, like CNN, they pretend they don't have a perspective, they don't have a narrative that they're selling, and now they're saying, these advisors, they're moderate, they're centrist, they don't have an agenda.
[01:57:00.499 --> 01:57:03.321]  It's only the people that were with Trump when he got elected.
[01:57:03.381 --> 01:57:04.582]  They're the ones with the agenda.
[01:57:05.043 --> 01:57:11.288]  Well, and let's leave policy aside for a second, David, because you and I would agree, I think, that these are bad policies.
[01:57:11.788 --> 01:57:13.970]  But to some extent, that's an opinion.
[01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:16.772]  In other words, you can have different views on policy, right?
[01:57:16.792 --> 01:57:19.755]  But let's talk about the politics of this for a second.
[01:57:20.395 --> 01:57:22.457]  This is an absolute disaster.
[01:57:22.517 --> 01:57:25.219]  These people are trying to kneecap the Trump administration.
[01:57:25.559 --> 01:57:29.423]  Because the fact is, if Donald Trump, nobody who voted for Trump,
[01:57:30.450 --> 01:57:31.991]  Supported him because he was moderate.
[01:57:32.311 --> 01:57:32.911]  You follow me?
[01:57:32.951 --> 01:57:33.251]  That's right.
[01:57:33.291 --> 01:57:33.631]  Nobody.
[01:57:33.791 --> 01:57:34.091]  That's right.
[01:57:34.111 --> 01:57:40.353]  And what's gonna happen is they're gonna gut his support and then they have so damaged Trump.
[01:57:40.393 --> 01:57:43.714]  Do you think there's any liberals who are gonna go, well, I don't know.
[01:57:44.635 --> 01:57:46.415]  He did hire a guy from TPP.
[01:57:46.775 --> 01:57:47.916]  I think he's coming around.
[01:57:47.976 --> 01:57:48.516]  I'm not, no, no.
[01:57:48.936 --> 01:57:51.317]  No, he's not gonna pick up anybody from the other side.
[01:57:51.577 --> 01:57:55.478]  So, so what they know is they know Trump's at about a 40% approval rating.
[01:57:56.358 --> 01:57:58.019]  If you lose half of that,
[01:57:59.181 --> 01:58:01.503]  You're down to about a 10% approval rating.
[01:58:01.803 --> 01:58:05.527]  If you lose half of the 40% who support him, you follow me?
[01:58:06.647 --> 01:58:06.988]  Yeah.
[01:58:07.008 --> 01:58:09.390]  50% of the 40% is 20% of that.
[01:58:09.430 --> 01:58:13.653]  You're down to about a 10-20% approval rating, which is exactly where they want him.
[01:58:14.014 --> 01:58:20.920]  The establishment wants to take Donald Trump down and salt the earth under him, which is why they're going after Steve Bannon.
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:24.702]  Again, it's not about Steve personally, it's about the agenda.
[01:58:25.162 --> 01:58:37.907]  This was the first candidate who actually took on issues, took on the media, took on the establishment in a way that showed some chutzpah and cojones, if I can mix my different languages.
[01:58:38.287 --> 01:58:40.969]  But he was able to do that.
[01:58:41.049 --> 01:58:44.850]  Now, they have to destroy him, and they got to him through his family.
[01:58:45.210 --> 01:58:48.232]  So it's not Game of Thrones, but
[01:58:48.832 --> 01:58:50.734]  It's Shakespearean kind of, right?
[01:58:51.474 --> 01:58:53.696]  They're using his family to get to him.
[01:58:54.397 --> 01:58:56.859]  Look, Trump's got an ego, in the same way Obama.
[01:58:57.179 --> 01:59:00.802]  You don't wake up one morning and decide, you know what the country really needs?
[01:59:02.023 --> 01:59:02.343]  Me.
[01:59:02.824 --> 01:59:03.104]  Me.
[01:59:03.124 --> 01:59:05.005]  And not have some ego, right?
[01:59:05.086 --> 01:59:07.748]  Anybody who runs for president, every one of them's got some ego.
[01:59:07.768 --> 01:59:08.108]  That's right.
[01:59:09.649 --> 01:59:17.613]  And what we see now, they're saying, now the discussion is no longer nationalism versus globalism, but it's combat versus collaboration.
[01:59:17.873 --> 01:59:19.134]  We want you to be a nice guy.
[01:59:19.154 --> 01:59:23.295]  As you're pointing out, Trump didn't win because he was a collaborator, okay?
[01:59:23.516 --> 01:59:25.056]  And we don't want to see him be a collaborator.
[01:59:25.116 --> 01:59:29.478]  And we don't want to see them use this game that the Democrats will always use.
[01:59:29.498 --> 01:59:32.580]  They'll always say, well, you know, they'll fight like mad when they're in power.
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:35.341]  But when the Republicans get, well, you need to work with us.
[01:59:35.481 --> 01:59:38.142]  We all need to agree on a consensus here.
[01:59:38.342 --> 01:59:40.783]  And that's the same thing they're doing now because they're a bunch of Democrats.
[01:59:40.823 --> 01:59:42.143]  The same thing they're doing now in the White House.
[01:59:42.163 --> 01:59:44.184]  They're saying, we need to collaborate on this.
[01:59:44.264 --> 01:59:45.704]  No more of this combat.
[01:59:46.004 --> 01:59:48.385]  You're either with us or you're against us.
[01:59:48.465 --> 01:59:53.447]  And we're going to shut this thing down as we move to the center, as we moderate the message.
[01:59:53.907 --> 01:59:55.868]  Well, and here's the other thing they've managed to do.
[01:59:55.888 --> 01:59:59.589]  And David, I know we're almost done here, but this is really important.
[02:00:01.058 --> 02:00:05.480]  The big person is not Bannon, who they've managed to separate Trump from.
[02:00:05.741 --> 02:00:07.622]  Do you know who they've managed to separate Trump from?
[02:00:08.762 --> 02:00:09.062]  You.
[02:00:09.543 --> 02:00:09.843]  Yes.
[02:00:10.443 --> 02:00:11.004]  The people.
[02:00:11.344 --> 02:00:11.504]  Yes.
[02:00:11.524 --> 02:00:12.104]  The people.
[02:00:12.624 --> 02:00:17.707]  They've managed to separate Trump from the crowds that were giving him feedback every day.
[02:00:18.047 --> 02:00:24.311]  Do you think if Trump came out and said, hey everybody, what do you think of the idea we're going to be more moderate?
[02:00:25.629 --> 02:00:28.592]  Crickets, right?
[02:00:28.852 --> 02:00:29.313]  That's right.
[02:00:29.793 --> 02:00:32.957]  The Trump crowds, that's what they managed to do, and so we can't let that happen.
[02:00:33.297 --> 02:00:36.200]  If you're a Trump supporter, be a Trump supporter and hold them accountable.
[02:00:36.661 --> 02:00:38.603]  Trump support, we didn't elect a king.
[02:00:39.063 --> 02:00:41.626]  That would be Don King, and that's a totally different hairstyle.
[02:00:41.806 --> 02:00:46.769]  Well, you know, that's very important because when you're talking about this, we have people pushing on this ship of state.
[02:00:47.369 --> 02:00:52.912]  And if we sit there and say, he's just playing 40 chess, we need to set back and we need to not put any pressure on him.
[02:00:53.152 --> 02:00:53.592]  Well, guess what?
[02:00:53.632 --> 02:00:56.054]  He's getting plenty of pressure from the Democrats.
[02:00:56.314 --> 02:01:01.136]  He's getting plenty of pressure from Jared Kushner, who's pushing him in one direction.
[02:01:01.256 --> 02:01:03.778]  And if you don't push back, if you don't say, wait a minute.
[02:01:04.338 --> 02:01:09.540]  You promised us on these issues, we want you to deliver on these issues that we elected you on.
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:16.902]  If you, the Trump voter, don't push back, he's going to say, well there's no resistance over here and I'm getting a lot of resistance over here.
[02:01:16.922 --> 02:01:19.603]  It's going to be very easy for them to move him in that direction.
[02:01:20.322 --> 02:01:25.829]  When you voted for Trump, if you voted for Trump, you did not abdicate your responsibilities as a citizen.
[02:01:25.849 --> 02:01:26.791]  That's right.
[02:01:27.051 --> 02:01:33.079]  To be informed and to hold him accountable, particularly when he's going against what he ran on.
[02:01:33.539 --> 02:01:38.045]  And this idea that some people have, and it's a small percentage, David, but
[02:01:38.877 --> 02:01:41.898]  It's a large enough where it bothers me.
[02:01:42.678 --> 02:01:52.062]  We should be better than Obama supporters who blindly went along with Obamacare even after he switched in the primaries from being against the individual mandate.
[02:01:52.082 --> 02:01:53.522]  Suddenly he's for it, right?
[02:01:53.702 --> 02:01:54.522]  Yes, yes.
[02:01:54.642 --> 02:01:55.923]  And I've seen this too often.
[02:01:56.323 --> 02:02:02.368]  When I was at the DNC convention in Philadelphia and we were talking to them about, look at this corruption in your party.
[02:02:02.688 --> 02:02:06.712]  Look at the exposed emails where they're shutting this down unfairly against Bernie Sanders.
[02:02:06.732 --> 02:02:07.432]  Don't you have anything to say?
[02:02:07.713 --> 02:02:09.674]  Oh, it's not about that, it's about those bad Russians.
[02:02:09.734 --> 02:02:11.396]  I don't want to see anything, I don't want to hear anything.
[02:02:12.076 --> 02:02:14.999]  And that's what I'm seeing from a lot of Trump supporters.
[02:02:15.099 --> 02:02:18.061]  And I've pointed this out and said, look, we're about ideology.
[02:02:18.121 --> 02:02:19.702]  We're not about idolatry.
[02:02:19.963 --> 02:02:22.665]  We're not following the man blindly because of who he is.
[02:02:22.905 --> 02:02:24.647]  We're trying to help him be Trump.
[02:02:25.347 --> 02:02:27.968]  We're not trying to, and that's the whole thing about Bannon.
[02:02:27.988 --> 02:02:29.348]  We're trying to help him be Trump.
[02:02:29.388 --> 02:02:35.890]  We're not trying to change him into something that he never was, which is what these people like Gary Cohen are trying to do in the administration now.
[02:02:36.610 --> 02:02:38.910]  Donald Trump is, this is the deal.
[02:02:39.010 --> 02:02:40.151]  It's real straightforward.
[02:02:40.671 --> 02:02:49.393]  If you're Ivanka Trump and you're Jared Kushner and you move in New York social circles, Donald Trump being related to you is embarrassing every single day.
[02:02:49.713 --> 02:02:50.394]  Yes.
[02:02:50.554 --> 02:02:51.535]  Does that make sense?
[02:02:51.635 --> 02:02:54.478]  That's one of the reasons why they pushed back against the Paris Climate Treaty.
[02:02:54.818 --> 02:03:05.650]  They had great movements from Trump's pick at EPA, Pruitt, and Trump signed this executive order, but they would not put in a pushback against the Endangerment Clause or the Paris Climate Treaty.
[02:03:05.730 --> 02:03:06.110]  Why?
[02:03:06.471 --> 02:03:12.116]  Because that would embarrass them with their social circle, with Justin Trudeau and others that they value so highly.
[02:03:12.837 --> 02:03:15.561]  Ivanka Trump is literally Leonardo DiCaprio.
[02:03:15.621 --> 02:03:16.122]  Google it.
[02:03:16.402 --> 02:03:22.271]  Ivanka Trump, Leonardo DiCaprio went to Trump Tower, gave her a DVD to give to Trump.
[02:03:23.132 --> 02:03:24.874]  Look, Ivanka Trump
[02:03:25.791 --> 02:03:26.131]  Fine.
[02:03:26.432 --> 02:03:27.493]  Go do your business.
[02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:32.377]  Everyone liked Ivanka Trump when she was helping run the hotels and she had her fashion business.
[02:03:32.937 --> 02:03:38.382]  Nobody thought Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner would be in the Oval Office every day.
[02:03:38.723 --> 02:03:42.486]  And because they are, they are fair game for criticism.
[02:03:42.766 --> 02:03:44.267]  This is not Barron Trump.
[02:03:44.548 --> 02:03:46.429]  This is not the Obama kids even.
[02:03:47.550 --> 02:03:48.110]  They're adults.
[02:03:48.431 --> 02:03:53.713]  And it's going to destroy them as well because the Democrats are not going to embrace them if they lose their base.
[02:03:53.773 --> 02:03:56.154]  It's really going to destroy Jared and Ivanka as well.
[02:03:56.434 --> 02:03:57.835]  Thank you so much, Lee Stranahan.
[02:03:57.875 --> 02:04:13.181]  You can find him at citizenjournalismschool.com and the... On the line we have Bill Mitchell of yourvoiceradio.com and he's also filming the show for his podcast.
[02:04:13.221 --> 02:04:14.262]  Bill, welcome to the show.
[02:04:15.422 --> 02:04:16.122]  Hey, how are you?
[02:04:16.182 --> 02:04:16.723]  Good to see you.
[02:04:17.683 --> 02:04:17.983]  Good.
[02:04:18.504 --> 02:04:22.406]  Now, I'm going to read you two Trump tweets, which he tweeted during the campaign.
[02:04:22.826 --> 02:04:23.626]  This is from Trump.
[02:04:23.826 --> 02:04:28.389]  Don't attack Syria, an attack that will bring nothing but trouble for the US.
[02:04:28.969 --> 02:04:31.590]  Focus on making our country strong and great again.
[02:04:31.931 --> 02:04:38.134]  He also tweeted, crooked Hillary Clinton and foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya.
[02:04:38.534 --> 02:04:40.235]  She is ruthless and dangerous.
[02:04:40.595 --> 02:04:54.443]  I think a real danger that we get into when we judge someone's current actions by their former tweets is that they have new information that they've attained on their current actions that they didn't have when they made that tweet.
[02:04:54.843 --> 02:04:56.384]  And this is one of the things I like about Donald Trump.
[02:04:56.424 --> 02:04:59.345]  He's not a classic conservative ideologue.
[02:04:59.365 --> 02:05:00.146]  He's a resultist.
[02:05:00.666 --> 02:05:02.327]  He's a CEO type mentality.
[02:05:02.767 --> 02:05:06.928]  And you don't want a CEO that goes in making decisions based on pure ideology.
[02:05:06.948 --> 02:05:12.590]  You want a CEO that goes in and makes decisions on the latest, most up-to-date, best information.
[02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:20.613]  Donald Trump came in and when these gas attacks were reported, and apparently our intelligence supported that this happened, okay?
[02:05:20.973 --> 02:05:27.879]  When these gas attacks happened, and Assad was responsible according to our intelligence, Donald Trump could either respond or not respond.
[02:05:27.939 --> 02:05:30.661]  If he didn't respond at all, that would be unacceptable as President of the United States.
[02:05:30.942 --> 02:05:33.824]  So if he responded and condemned them, then he had to act.
[02:05:33.964 --> 02:05:36.186]  If he did not act, then he became Obama 2.0.
[02:05:37.367 --> 02:05:41.009]  Okay, so we had to act in a surgical, limited way.
[02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:43.430]  And they followed the intelligence and they did it.
[02:05:43.730 --> 02:05:44.471]  They acted.
[02:05:44.811 --> 02:05:46.752]  The upside of this is tremendous.
[02:05:46.832 --> 02:05:51.414]  You know, the entire, here's the thing, the entire Russiagate thing just died.
[02:05:52.175 --> 02:05:52.615]  It's over.
[02:05:53.055 --> 02:05:53.335]  It's over.
[02:05:53.495 --> 02:05:58.098]  Because what person in the world would say that Donald Trump is acting as the puppet of Putin?
[02:05:58.738 --> 02:06:02.141]  Now that Donald Trump has basically stuck his finger in Putin's eye in Syria.
[02:06:02.581 --> 02:06:03.121]  That's over.
[02:06:03.261 --> 02:06:07.425]  Based upon what I'm seeing on Twitter, you know, you said that we're split on this.
[02:06:07.525 --> 02:06:08.525]  I disagree with that statement.
[02:06:08.765 --> 02:06:12.488]  I think this is maybe 20% against, 80% for.
[02:06:12.989 --> 02:06:13.189]  Okay?
[02:06:13.269 --> 02:06:15.911]  I see very positive support for Trump on this.
[02:06:16.191 --> 02:06:21.255]  I see the people that were initially very against this saying, I'm going to abandon Trump on this.
[02:06:21.395 --> 02:06:22.616]  I'm off the Trump train on this.
[02:06:22.896 --> 02:06:23.957]  I see that fading away.
[02:06:24.137 --> 02:06:25.438]  You know, here's the thing people got to understand.
[02:06:25.618 --> 02:06:27.079]  The Trump train has got many cars on it.
[02:06:27.419 --> 02:06:29.601]  If you don't like the drapes on one car, move to another car.
[02:06:29.841 --> 02:06:30.061]  Okay?
[02:06:30.301 --> 02:06:34.604]  Because if you say that you're going to abandon Trump on this, then what are you going to do for the next four years?
[02:06:34.944 --> 02:06:36.225]  I mean, what about tax reform?
[02:06:36.465 --> 02:06:37.626]  What about healthcare reform?
[02:06:37.846 --> 02:06:38.667]  What about the wall?
[02:06:38.747 --> 02:06:39.928]  What about immigration reform?
[02:06:39.948 --> 02:06:40.768]  What about jobs?
[02:06:41.128 --> 02:06:41.929]  These are other cars.
[02:06:42.189 --> 02:06:44.250]  If you believe in those, but stay on the Trump train.
[02:06:44.290 --> 02:06:45.131]  Don't abandon Trump.
[02:06:45.351 --> 02:06:47.232]  There's nothing wrong with disagreeing with Trump on this.
[02:06:47.272 --> 02:06:48.393]  He likes that feedback.
[02:06:48.433 --> 02:06:49.154]  That's important to him.
[02:06:49.174 --> 02:06:50.154]  That's part of his strategy.
[02:06:50.495 --> 02:06:52.516]  But in my case, I think this is a great move.
[02:06:52.596 --> 02:06:56.999]  I think history will look back at this as a turning point in the Middle East and a brilliant move.
[02:07:05.365 --> 02:07:06.886]  There is a crisis in America today.
[02:07:07.346 --> 02:07:09.748]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[02:07:10.048 --> 02:07:17.453]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[02:07:17.853 --> 02:07:21.456]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[02:07:21.816 --> 02:07:22.957]  I have the answer for you today.
[02:07:23.357 --> 02:07:24.518]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[02:07:25.253 --> 02:07:30.558]  The Block It Pocket works by securing your phone in its safe, no-radiation compartment.
[02:07:30.999 --> 02:07:36.764]  I use the Block It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[02:07:37.585 --> 02:07:40.047]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[02:07:40.268 --> 02:07:46.233]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[02:07:46.974 --> 02:07:48.636]  With the Block-It Pocket, this is impossible.
[02:07:49.116 --> 02:07:51.818]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[02:07:52.119 --> 02:07:56.663]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own Block-It Pocket.
[02:08:20.279 --> 02:08:21.702]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:21.742 --> 02:08:22.443]  I'm David Knight.
[02:08:22.683 --> 02:08:24.106]  We just talked to Lee Stranahan.
[02:08:24.146 --> 02:08:31.118]  I'm going to give you a couple more headlines here about what's going on with Facebook as well as with Google.
[02:08:32.233 --> 02:08:33.813]  And other journalism issues.
[02:08:33.833 --> 02:08:35.254]  Very interesting interview with Lee.
[02:08:35.694 --> 02:08:42.616]  Because we have to understand that what is going on in the White House has real consequences.
[02:08:42.736 --> 02:08:45.977]  Not only for Jared and Ivanka.
[02:08:45.997 --> 02:08:47.597]  It's not going to work out well for them.
[02:08:47.657 --> 02:08:51.198]  They're not going to find that the Democrats are going to ever embrace them.
[02:08:52.178 --> 02:08:55.259]  But they can very easily alienate the Trump voters as well.
[02:08:55.359 --> 02:08:59.060]  So as they push Trump away from the agenda on which he won,
[02:09:00.152 --> 02:09:02.977]  Uh, it's not a good thing even for the Trump family.
[02:09:02.997 --> 02:09:14.695]  I understand that Donald Trump needs people around him that he believes that he can trust, but they're bringing in people who are going to be presenting him information, briefs, dossiers that are going to push him in a particular
[02:09:15.756 --> 02:09:19.297]  And that's what we were talking about with the mainstream media.
[02:09:19.317 --> 02:09:24.638]  When they come in and say, look, you can trust CNN, but you can't trust InfoWars.
[02:09:24.958 --> 02:09:25.658]  Why would that be?
[02:09:25.798 --> 02:09:29.039]  Well, because CNN is an establishment.
[02:09:29.079 --> 02:09:30.039]  They're moderate.
[02:09:30.419 --> 02:09:31.320]  They're centrist.
[02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:32.520]  InfoWars is not.
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:37.301]  And that's the same type of skewing that is going on in the White House with the advisors who are around him.
[02:09:37.921 --> 02:09:38.441]  That's the key.
[02:09:38.801 --> 02:09:49.143]  When you pick people to advise you, when you pick your news sources, you can pretty much skew people by the information that you feed them and the stuff that you keep away from them.
[02:09:49.163 --> 02:09:56.585]  And again, today we had Google coming back and saying, you know, that singling out of InfoWars was just a rogue vendor who was doing it.
[02:09:56.705 --> 02:10:03.846]  Well, the fact remains that Google is not only going to tell you who is fake and who is true,
[02:10:04.778 --> 02:10:11.405]  They're going to put those labels on individual stories, that would be bad enough as I said, but they're going to do it to entire news sites.
[02:10:11.725 --> 02:10:14.588]  And that is indefensible, quite frankly.
[02:10:14.628 --> 02:10:19.473]  They're being used by the government in a private-public partnership to outsource censorship.
[02:10:20.906 --> 02:10:33.518]  I want to go to the election news that's coming up as well, but before we do, I just want to remind you that the sale that we've had at infowarestore.com, the Easter Mega Specials that we had, that will be ending tonight.
[02:10:33.738 --> 02:10:38.602]  And these are discounts of a wide variety of products, anywhere from 25 to 30 percent.
[02:10:39.023 --> 02:10:42.706]  Some of the products that we have at 25 percent are Super Male, Super Female Vitality.
[02:10:43.046 --> 02:10:46.289]  Also, Survival Shield, X2 Nascent Iodine, that is 25 percent off.
[02:10:47.370 --> 02:10:52.515]  Secret 12, our vitamin B12 formulation is 25% off as is vitamin mineral fusion.
[02:10:52.555 --> 02:10:56.198]  That's our drink mix that has a lot of essential vitamins and minerals.
[02:10:56.218 --> 02:11:04.786]  You can take that and it's very easy to take a large variety and diversity of vitamins and minerals so you don't have to take a lot of pills.
[02:11:04.826 --> 02:11:11.352]  That's what I like about drinking my supplements or putting it under my tongue so I don't have to get a B12 shot.
[02:11:11.372 --> 02:11:13.134]  I can just put Secret 12 under my tongue.
[02:11:13.294 --> 02:11:14.836]  You can get all that for 25% off.
[02:11:15.076 --> 02:11:16.058]  That's going to be ending today.
[02:11:16.318 --> 02:11:19.042]  And also, Brain Force is now 30% off.
[02:11:19.082 --> 02:11:23.167]  That will also be ending today as part of our Easter Mega Specials.
[02:11:24.309 --> 02:11:26.692]  We've got an election that is going to be happening today.
[02:11:26.712 --> 02:11:29.215]  It's all in progress right now in Georgia.
[02:11:30.179 --> 02:11:32.420]  And we're going to talk about that on the other side of the break.
[02:11:33.061 --> 02:11:36.522]  These stories that we've got about Facebook, there's a couple of these.
[02:11:36.803 --> 02:11:39.404]  They keep talking about how they're going to take down fake news.
[02:11:39.484 --> 02:11:41.165]  And they're doing this in France.
[02:11:41.185 --> 02:11:46.868]  They're scrambling to take down accounts that are pro-Le Pen before this election.
[02:11:46.888 --> 02:11:49.489]  And this is coming up in just six days.
[02:11:49.930 --> 02:11:51.971]  So they're removing accounts that they think are
[02:11:52.892 --> 02:11:56.660]  Favorable to Marine Le Pen because they don't like her politically.
[02:11:56.700 --> 02:11:58.224]  That's the way they're using the censorship.
[02:11:58.284 --> 02:11:59.968]  It is all ideologically based.
[02:12:00.731 --> 02:12:02.512]  They have algorithms that will do it.
[02:12:02.572 --> 02:12:18.445]  They have moderators who will do it, but of course at the same time we've got the Facebook moderators who may be facing criminal charges in the UK because they did not take down violent and pedophile videos when they were told about it.
[02:12:19.006 --> 02:12:27.973]  So now the UK government says if you hire moderators to do this, people report this content to you celebrating the terrorist attacks in Egypt against Christians.
[02:12:28.653 --> 02:12:31.138]  Or showing a violent pedophile attack.
[02:12:31.499 --> 02:12:35.026]  Somebody reports that to you, and you, it's Facebook with your moderators.
[02:12:35.046 --> 02:12:35.727]  You don't take that down.
[02:12:35.767 --> 02:12:36.649]  You now own that.
[02:12:37.418 --> 02:12:39.519]  And we're going to look at criminal charges against you.
[02:12:39.939 --> 02:12:41.320]  So we see that type of thing.
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:43.061]  That got virtually no coverage.
[02:12:43.701 --> 02:12:46.643]  We talked about it here after Drudge picked up on that.
[02:12:47.063 --> 02:12:49.244]  But all you've heard about is the Facebook killer.
[02:12:49.584 --> 02:12:51.025]  And of course he committed suicide today.
[02:12:51.065 --> 02:12:52.246]  Everybody's going to be talking about that.
[02:12:52.406 --> 02:12:59.149]  Nobody's going to talk about the fact that Facebook did not take down terrorist and pedophile videos in the UK.
[02:12:59.870 --> 02:13:01.991]  But they are taking down pro-Le Pen accounts.
[02:13:02.631 --> 02:13:21.717]  And they have also, and this is also coming out of the UK, after they looked at this situation where they refused to take down that objectionable content, another investigation in the UK found paid-for hoaxes about high-profile public figures next to the users' news feeds, duping them to click to alleged scam websites.
[02:13:21.737 --> 02:13:28.739]  They say the revelation came days after a Times investigation exposed terrorist and child pornography content on Facebook.
[02:13:29.219 --> 02:13:39.441]  They say in the latest incidents, users have reported hoaxes concerning Lord Sugar, I don't know who Sugar is, Stephen Hawking and the Queen that take them to websites mimicking news sites such as The Sun.
[02:13:39.921 --> 02:13:45.482]  So again, you have more information about Facebook that people don't want to pay attention to.
[02:13:45.522 --> 02:13:47.542]  They only want to look at the Facebook killer.
[02:13:47.562 --> 02:13:49.163]  When we come back, we're going to talk about the election.
[02:13:49.503 --> 02:13:49.903]  Stay with us.
[02:13:50.283 --> 02:13:51.183]  We're on the march.
[02:13:51.663 --> 02:13:53.263]  The empire's on the run.
[02:13:54.203 --> 02:13:56.864]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:14:01.727 --> 02:14:03.088]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:14:03.308 --> 02:14:08.111]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[02:14:08.231 --> 02:14:11.494]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[02:14:11.754 --> 02:14:17.137]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:14:17.578 --> 02:14:26.163]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[02:14:26.404 --> 02:14:31.507]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[02:14:31.767 --> 02:14:38.452]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[02:14:38.732 --> 02:14:43.335]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[02:14:43.475 --> 02:14:46.638]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.

[02:16:00.623 --> 02:16:09.148]  On Sunday, Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones broke the news that Google contractors are being directed to rate InfoWars articles to push them even further down in search engine results.
[02:16:09.448 --> 02:16:12.090]  And liberals came out of the woodwork to say we were lying.
[02:16:12.410 --> 02:16:13.871]  Well now we have Business Insider.
[02:16:14.031 --> 02:16:20.375]  Google says rogue vendor violated guidelines by instructing contractors to rate InfoWars as untrustworthy site.
[02:16:20.575 --> 02:16:27.039]  Google said that the vendor had mistakenly told staffers working for the search engine that InfoWars should be ranked as a low-quality site.
[02:16:27.199 --> 02:16:28.620]  Oh yeah, we believe you Google.
[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:29.441]  We believe you.
[02:16:29.641 --> 02:16:37.890]  Google reps are attempting to distance themselves from the contractor's instructions by saying it does not instruct quality rangers on how to grade specific websites.
[02:16:38.111 --> 02:16:40.754]  Let's read what the contractor said in their bonus example.
[02:16:40.974 --> 02:16:45.659]  While CNN isn't a perfect news outlet, it is a popular news source that covers stories with depth to compare.
[02:16:45.819 --> 02:16:49.604]  The InfoWars article is brief and only mentions statements from sources not typical.
[02:16:49.924 --> 02:16:56.514]  Of course, they're talking about the recent Syrian chemical attack that we're saying is a false flag and is now being proven in spades.
[02:16:56.775 --> 02:16:59.739]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:17:18.661 --> 02:17:24.770]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:17:25.131 --> 02:17:26.653]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:17:28.415 --> 02:17:29.837]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:29.897 --> 02:17:33.262]  I'm David Knight and today is a special election in Georgia.
[02:17:34.281 --> 02:17:40.984]  This is a replacement for Tom Price, who was brought into the Trump administration as the Director of Health and Human Services.
[02:17:41.004 --> 02:17:48.987]  And it's kind of interesting because this has been a race that has attracted a lot of outside money, even outside volunteers.
[02:17:49.647 --> 02:17:54.109]  As one of the Hollywood people coming in, Alyssa Milano, a Hollywood actress, came in.
[02:17:54.129 --> 02:17:57.310]  She said, it's the seat heard around the world.
[02:17:57.371 --> 02:17:58.271]  Everybody is watching.
[02:17:58.351 --> 02:18:02.473]  All the recent special elections have taken on a certain symbolism of resistance.
[02:18:02.533 --> 02:18:02.873]  This is
[02:18:03.593 --> 02:18:08.667]  An opportunity the left, the Democrats, think they have of pushing back against Trump.
[02:18:09.228 --> 02:18:10.251]  And so they're all in.
[02:18:11.069 --> 02:18:15.111]  They put in $8.3 million into this race in just three months.
[02:18:16.071 --> 02:18:23.315]  And $3 million has been put in to answer this by the GOP, mostly to point out how much outside money is coming in from the Democrats.
[02:18:24.195 --> 02:18:27.697]  So that's the tenor of most of the GOP money.
[02:18:27.997 --> 02:18:32.700]  And this is also interesting because there's so many different candidates in there.
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:33.940]  17, 18 different candidates.
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:37.102]  I think it's 11 Republicans, 6 Democrats in this one race.
[02:18:37.918 --> 02:18:37.978]  And
[02:18:55.211 --> 02:18:59.195]  To help knock on doors and call people up on the phone.
[02:18:59.215 --> 02:19:01.938]  A lot of volunteers from New York and other places.
[02:19:01.978 --> 02:19:03.820]  So it's outside money, outside volunteers.
[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:08.704]  And you know, the most interesting thing that broke today is, maybe it's even an outside candidate.
[02:19:09.305 --> 02:19:11.867]  Now I'm not talking about somebody who's outside of the establishment.
[02:19:11.907 --> 02:19:14.230]  No, he's very firmly within the establishment.
[02:19:14.830 --> 02:19:17.313]  But he's actually outside the district.
[02:19:17.353 --> 02:19:19.475]  Here's this report from CNN earlier today.
[02:19:22.168 --> 02:19:25.970]  I urge folks to make their voices heard and consider sending some fresh leadership to Washington.
[02:19:26.330 --> 02:19:29.791]  Mr. Ossoff, is it true that you cannot vote for yourself?
[02:19:30.892 --> 02:19:31.972]  He can't vote for himself.
[02:19:32.452 --> 02:19:33.933]  Well, I grew up in this district.
[02:19:34.273 --> 02:19:35.413]  I grew up in this community.
[02:19:36.174 --> 02:19:37.834]  No one knew there was going to be an election coming.
[02:19:37.874 --> 02:19:42.877]  I've been living with Alicia, my girlfriend, at 12 years down by Emory University, where she's a full-time medical student.
[02:19:43.477 --> 02:19:48.359]  And as soon as she concludes her medical training, I'll be 10 minutes back up the street into the district where I grew up.
[02:19:48.739 --> 02:19:50.900]  But I want to support her in her career and do right by her.
[02:19:51.591 --> 02:19:53.012]  So, when are you going to marry her?
[02:19:56.293 --> 02:20:00.795]  Well, I don't want to give anything away, but I think I could reasonably say that's more of a personal question.
[02:20:01.035 --> 02:20:02.796]  I'll give you a call when I have something to announce.
[02:20:03.276 --> 02:20:03.917]  Please do.
[02:20:04.077 --> 02:20:06.658]  Perhaps say an election day proposal would be good.
[02:20:06.698 --> 02:20:09.059]  Don't make any campaign promises you're not intending on keeping.
[02:20:09.079 --> 02:20:15.602]  But I guess your point is that you don't live in the district in which you're running, so you will not be able to vote for yourself.
[02:20:17.950 --> 02:20:19.531]  Well, I grew up in this district.
[02:20:19.611 --> 02:20:20.651]  I grew up in this community.
[02:20:20.711 --> 02:20:21.291]  It's my home.
[02:20:21.811 --> 02:20:22.872]  My family is still there.
[02:20:22.912 --> 02:20:26.513]  I'm a mile and a half down the street to support Alicia while she finishes medical school.
[02:20:27.813 --> 02:20:29.434]  It's something I've been very transparent about.
[02:20:29.454 --> 02:20:31.474]  In fact, I'm proud to be supporting her career.
[02:20:31.994 --> 02:20:36.776]  And as soon as she finishes her medical training, I'll be 10 minutes back up the road into the district where I grew up.
[02:20:37.216 --> 02:20:40.637]  Alright, John Ossoff, we will be watching very closely what happens to you professionally.
[02:20:40.657 --> 02:20:43.218]  Okay, so it's all about supporting his girlfriend.
[02:20:43.238 --> 02:20:45.219]  I guess the question is who's supporting who?
[02:20:45.899 --> 02:20:47.199]  Is this guy got a job?
[02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:54.882]  It seems to me like if he's supporting his girlfriend, she would be moving ten minutes down the road to live with him in the congressional district that he's running for.
[02:20:55.242 --> 02:20:56.522]  But it's also kind of strange, isn't it?
[02:20:56.562 --> 02:20:57.623]  Because we have the Democrats.
[02:20:58.143 --> 02:21:01.745]  We're always saying that even illegal immigrants ought to have the vote.
[02:21:01.905 --> 02:21:04.106]  I mean, people who aren't citizens of the U.S.
[02:21:04.126 --> 02:21:08.287]  So, you know, why should that be a problem for Democrats that he doesn't live in his district?
[02:21:08.327 --> 02:21:10.408]  Yeah, he's the true outsider candidate.
[02:21:10.608 --> 02:21:13.470]  And so we got Hollywood moving there in large numbers.
[02:21:14.410 --> 02:21:20.138]  As Karen Handel, who is the leading GOP candidate, she says, Hollywood is all in on electing this guy.
[02:21:20.158 --> 02:21:23.642]  She said, the Democrats have liberal media and Hollywood celebrities to sing their praises.
[02:21:23.682 --> 02:21:24.584]  We have something better.
[02:21:24.824 --> 02:21:25.024]  You.
[02:21:25.064 --> 02:21:27.848]  They're trying to get the vote out in this particular situation.
[02:21:27.928 --> 02:21:32.534]  But also, I think it's kind of interesting as Hollywood moves in on this, one of the attack
[02:21:32.754 --> 02:21:32.934]  That's
[02:22:02.994 --> 02:22:03.575]  Dukakis.
[02:22:04.556 --> 02:22:14.386]  Remember when Dukakis put on that stupid helmet and rode around in the tank when he was running against George H.W.
[02:22:14.426 --> 02:22:14.846]  Bush?
[02:22:14.926 --> 02:22:15.867]  It was all over for him.
[02:22:16.328 --> 02:22:21.233]  And maybe he ought to rethink the idea of going down the street playing lightsabers with people.
[02:22:21.793 --> 02:22:24.236]  That doesn't really help his gravitas too much.
[02:22:24.856 --> 02:22:25.737]  They point out that
[02:22:27.031 --> 02:22:31.034]  He is, they don't think that he's going to get past the 50% line.
[02:22:31.315 --> 02:22:35.158]  He's going to be running against a Republican, her name is Handel.
[02:22:35.818 --> 02:22:38.861]  They say that they put her support at between 17 and 21%.
[02:22:39.061 --> 02:22:46.247]  And this is in a field where they've got, yeah there he is, the Han Solo picture of him.
[02:22:46.627 --> 02:22:50.010]  This is in a field of, as I pointed out, 17 or 18 candidates.
[02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:55.574]  It's also interesting because this has been a Republican district since 1979.
[02:22:55.654 --> 02:22:58.176]  This is Newt Gingrich's former district.
[02:22:58.557 --> 02:23:00.258]  Now it got a little bit close for Trump.
[02:23:00.318 --> 02:23:01.679]  Trump only won by one point.
[02:23:01.979 --> 02:23:05.182]  Mitt Romney, four years prior, had won that district by 23 points.
[02:23:06.463 --> 02:23:08.664]  And again, they're trying to make this a referendum.
[02:23:08.704 --> 02:23:14.386]  This is, the Democrats believe, their chance to strike back against Donald Trump.
[02:23:14.466 --> 02:23:19.668]  I don't think they're going to do it if they don't get past the 50% on this initial election.
[02:23:19.988 --> 02:23:24.109]  The woman who will probably be in the runoff with him is the author of a book.
[02:23:24.209 --> 02:23:26.010]  It's called Plan Bullyhood.
[02:23:26.778 --> 02:23:34.161]  And it was about her time at breast cancer charity Susan G Komen for the Cure and the organization's relationship to Planned Parenthood.
[02:23:34.881 --> 02:23:38.282]  She's talking about reducing corporate taxes and repealing Obamacare.
[02:23:39.102 --> 02:23:43.304]  Ossoff is taking the position that he would just improve Obamacare.
[02:23:44.004 --> 02:23:53.327]  Maybe he could work with Trump on that, because we're seeing that Trump and Paul Ryan and these other people, they seem to be taking Obamacare repeal off the table.
[02:23:53.407 --> 02:23:55.768]  And I tell you what, if you take that position, we're done.
[02:23:56.408 --> 02:23:56.989]  We're really not.
[02:23:57.750 --> 02:23:59.171]  You go back and you look at the income tax.
[02:23:59.231 --> 02:24:00.213]  I talked about that earlier.
[02:24:00.233 --> 02:24:04.317]  You know, $100,000 standard deduction when it first started in today's dollars.
[02:24:05.319 --> 02:24:06.760]  And now we're down to $12,000.
[02:24:06.820 --> 02:24:09.243]  Whenever they start out, these programs are very, very small.
[02:24:10.213 --> 02:24:15.956]  What we saw with Obamacare, it immediately, immediately skyrocketed insurance rates.
[02:24:16.656 --> 02:24:22.280]  And if they allow this thing to put roots down into our system, it's going to become something like Social Security.
[02:24:22.300 --> 02:24:27.362]  As a matter of fact, I think a lot of the Republicans already see it as a third rail that they can't touch.
[02:24:27.642 --> 02:24:35.807]  And one of the reasons they see that is because the Democrats have very craftily set the metric as the number of people insured.
[02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:38.021]  Not the cost.
[02:24:38.662 --> 02:24:46.391]  So when you look at the number of people insured, and Donald Trump has kind of stepped in this as well when he started out, he said, we're going to have everybody with great insurance.
[02:24:47.072 --> 02:24:52.858]  You can either have affordable health care or you can have universal health care.
[02:24:54.094 --> 02:24:57.757]  Quite frankly, I would say if you have universal health care, it's going to go the way of Venezuela.
[02:24:57.917 --> 02:24:59.338]  You're not even going to have health care.
[02:24:59.978 --> 02:25:01.159]  Most people aren't going to have it.
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:03.681]  The few people in Washington, yeah, they'll have health care.
[02:25:03.701 --> 02:25:05.422]  They'll always have a Cadillac health care system.
[02:25:05.922 --> 02:25:10.766]  But if you go for universal health care, you are falling into the trap of socialism.
[02:25:11.086 --> 02:25:15.889]  If you allow them to define this thing as the number of people who have coverage, we've lost.
[02:25:16.750 --> 02:25:20.572]  They have defined the terms of debate, and the terms of debate then will be how many people have coverage.
[02:25:20.932 --> 02:25:22.073]  Not whether or not it's affordable.
[02:25:22.113 --> 02:25:24.434]  Remember, it was going to be the Affordable Health Care Act.
[02:25:25.295 --> 02:25:26.275]  Paul Ryan changed that.
[02:25:26.496 --> 02:25:28.977]  He called it the American Health Care Act.
[02:25:29.037 --> 02:25:30.178]  They know it's not going to be affordable.
[02:25:30.818 --> 02:25:31.818]  Not if you have mandates.
[02:25:32.439 --> 02:25:34.200]  If you have mandates, you're not going to have markets.
[02:25:35.601 --> 02:25:39.583]  You need to have choice and competition, not coercion.
[02:25:40.851 --> 02:25:42.231]  That's why it has to be repealed.
[02:25:42.531 --> 02:25:48.393]  If you leave the framework there, and you do what this Democrat wants to do, he wants to help to improve it.
[02:25:48.413 --> 02:25:50.434]  We're going to put some lipstick on it.
[02:25:51.454 --> 02:25:59.076]  Or as John Cleese likes to put it, instead of lipstick on a pig, I like it better, he says, mascara on Quasimodo.
[02:25:59.096 --> 02:26:01.597]  I think that's a better image, actually.
[02:26:02.197 --> 02:26:04.437]  Or a toupee on the Elephant Man.
[02:26:04.557 --> 02:26:05.998]  That was another one from Cleese.
[02:26:06.398 --> 02:26:07.918]  That's really what we're talking about here.
[02:26:08.599 --> 02:26:09.639]  Now, we need to get rid of it.
[02:26:10.404 --> 02:26:12.686]  You can't allow that infrastructure to be there.
[02:26:13.207 --> 02:26:29.962]  And phase two of the plan that Paul Ryan pulled on Trump was to say that we're going to use Tom Price, the guy that they're now replacing here in this Georgia district, they're going to use the Health and Human Services czar to dictate changes that are going to make it more palatable.
[02:26:31.462 --> 02:26:34.324]  So we shouldn't have a health czar who's dictating stuff to us.
[02:26:34.764 --> 02:26:36.165]  We want to have affordable health care.
[02:26:36.365 --> 02:26:37.446]  We're going to have to have a market.
[02:26:37.486 --> 02:26:38.447]  We're going to have to have choice.
[02:26:38.467 --> 02:26:40.748]  We're going to have to have information and competition.
[02:26:41.429 --> 02:26:43.831]  That was the plan that Donald Trump ran on.
[02:26:44.831 --> 02:26:46.372]  Do what you ran on.
[02:26:46.653 --> 02:26:47.813]  Fulfill your promises.
[02:26:48.394 --> 02:26:49.374]  That's what the people want.
[02:26:49.475 --> 02:26:51.276]  That is a winning proposition.
[02:26:52.591 --> 02:26:57.252]  People have voted time and again for Republicans to repeal Obamacare.
[02:26:57.272 --> 02:27:03.513]  As a matter of fact, the front-running Republican is running on a platform now of repealing Obamacare.
[02:27:04.273 --> 02:27:04.733]  You understand?
[02:27:04.933 --> 02:27:06.134]  That's a winning proposition.
[02:27:06.574 --> 02:27:07.994]  That's what Republican voters want.
[02:27:08.594 --> 02:27:09.494]  That's what the people want.
[02:27:09.674 --> 02:27:10.894]  Do what the people want.
[02:27:11.214 --> 02:27:12.535]  Do what we sent you there for.
[02:27:13.335 --> 02:27:14.655]  Paul Ryan is not going to do that.
[02:27:15.135 --> 02:27:19.176]  Paul Ryan has always been part of the establishment that was going to shut that thing down.
[02:27:20.083 --> 02:27:24.846]  And so, it's going to be interesting to see how this works out.
[02:27:25.066 --> 02:27:26.427]  There's also some other election news.
[02:27:26.467 --> 02:27:28.968]  We have Theresa May, as I pointed out earlier in the program.
[02:27:29.728 --> 02:27:33.670]  She has, on the spur of the moment, decided that she's going to call an election in June.
[02:27:34.231 --> 02:27:38.073]  Let's play that clip where she explains why she's calling a general election.
[02:27:39.384 --> 02:27:45.651]  At this moment of enormous national significance, there should be unity here in Westminster.
[02:27:46.392 --> 02:27:48.494]  But instead, there is division.
[02:27:49.496 --> 02:27:53.440]  The country is coming together, but Westminster is not.
[02:27:53.941 --> 02:27:59.327]  If we do not hold a general election now, their political game-playing will continue.
[02:28:00.325 --> 02:28:07.729]  And the negotiations with the European Union will reach their most difficult stage in the run-up to the next scheduled election.
[02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:11.271]  So I have a simple challenge to the opposition parties.
[02:28:12.292 --> 02:28:14.653]  You have criticised the government's vision for Brexit.
[02:28:15.254 --> 02:28:16.875]  You have challenged our objectives.
[02:28:17.475 --> 02:28:20.977]  You have threatened to block the legislation we put before Parliament.
[02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:24.473]  This is your moment to show you mean it.
[02:28:25.234 --> 02:28:27.878]  To show you are not opposing the government for the sake of it.
[02:28:28.519 --> 02:28:31.403]  To show that you do not treat politics as a game.
[02:28:31.423 --> 02:28:33.967]  That's kind of interesting.
[02:28:34.167 --> 02:28:36.751]  The headline on the Drudge Report was May and June.
[02:28:37.937 --> 02:28:40.419]  Uh, Prime Minister May is calling the elections in June.
[02:28:40.739 --> 02:28:42.760]  This is really Brexit Part Deux.
[02:28:43.601 --> 02:28:49.525]  This is really a referendum on moving forward with Brexit with giving her a consensus to move forward with that.
[02:28:50.025 --> 02:28:57.410]  And as CNN points out, the European Union brushed off her announcement, said that it would not affect their negotiations on Britain's departure.
[02:28:58.030 --> 02:29:11.943]  But they say that May's decision means that Europe's three most powerful nations, France, Germany and Britain, will be convulsed by internal election campaigns as the clock ticks on the two-year deadline to complete Brexit negotiations.
[02:29:12.644 --> 02:29:15.867]  As we're running up to this, we see with the French elections coming up in just a week,
[02:29:16.367 --> 02:29:26.672]  Not only is Facebook scrambling to take down pro-Le Pen accounts, but we also see some terrorists were caught planning a violent imminent attack in Marseille.
[02:29:27.073 --> 02:29:29.374]  This is a French interior minister pointed this out.
[02:29:29.394 --> 02:29:33.636]  He said two radicalized men born in 1987 and 1993 of French nationality intended to commit
[02:29:37.738 --> 02:29:42.041]  In the very short term, by that I mean in the coming days, an attack on French soil.
[02:29:42.081 --> 02:29:57.593]  And I talked about this yesterday on the nightly news, this study that came out of Vienna, Austria, where a Turkish-born Austrian professor did a study looking at 10,000 children aged 2 to 6 who attended Muslim preschools.
[02:29:57.653 --> 02:30:00.095]  And he talked about how this radicalized them.
[02:30:00.655 --> 02:30:07.663]  How it tended them towards extremism, but also how it shut them off from the society in which they live.
[02:30:08.524 --> 02:30:10.767]  And I've said this many times, I've said the second generation...
[02:30:11.678 --> 02:30:17.063]  is going to be far more dangerous in terms of a percentage of those who are radicalized than the first generation is.
[02:30:17.103 --> 02:30:30.174]  They don't know where they came from, they don't know the problems in that society, but they do know that they have been living in this ghetto of their parents' own making, quite frankly, because they don't want to participate in that society.
[02:30:30.214 --> 02:30:35.919]  They want to wall themselves off, they want to remain separate, and as they do that, and they see that they're not prospering,
[02:30:36.519 --> 02:30:41.222]  The second generation, like we see in this situation in France, they get very resentful, very angry about that.
[02:30:41.242 --> 02:30:45.786]  That's why you see so many second generation immigrants doing this type of thing.
[02:30:46.687 --> 02:30:49.369]  Now, we also had the election in Turkey that is now being disputed.
[02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:55.152]  Over 2.5 million Turkish votes were possibly manipulated, say, international observers.
[02:30:55.773 --> 02:31:00.556]  The interesting thing, I think, about the Turkey election is that Erdogan doesn't really care about the EU.
[02:31:01.036 --> 02:31:02.257]  He doesn't really care about NATO.
[02:31:02.277 --> 02:31:04.258]  You know, he's calling the EU Nazis.
[02:31:04.919 --> 02:31:05.219]  Why?
[02:31:05.899 --> 02:31:12.984]  Because when he went there to campaign, as the New York Times points out, they called it the diaspora, the Turkish diaspora.
[02:31:13.564 --> 02:31:20.772]  What you're looking at is the takeover of Europe by Muslims, turning it into Arabia.
[02:31:21.413 --> 02:31:24.837]  And that's why he was there campaigning, because there were so many Turks there.
[02:31:24.857 --> 02:31:28.381]  I guess they get to vote in the Turkish election, plus they get to vote in the European elections.
[02:31:28.421 --> 02:31:29.261]  That's great.
[02:31:29.282 --> 02:31:31.304]  You get to vote in multiple elections there.
[02:31:31.744 --> 02:31:33.826]  But he doesn't really care about the EU.
[02:31:33.886 --> 02:31:37.509]  He's calling them Nazis because they said, no, we're not going to let you campaign here.
[02:31:37.549 --> 02:31:40.531]  He was going, interestingly enough, you're talking about hypocrisy.
[02:31:41.052 --> 02:31:47.357]  The guy wanted to send his ministers to the European Union to campaign for dictatorial powers.
[02:31:47.397 --> 02:31:48.918]  That's what this referendum was about.
[02:31:49.539 --> 02:31:53.322]  And then he has the audacity to call the Europeans Nazis.
[02:31:53.442 --> 02:31:57.145]  I mean, he's campaigning for Nazi powers and he calls them Nazis.
[02:31:57.185 --> 02:31:58.846]  But he's also not interested in NATO.
[02:31:58.946 --> 02:31:59.207]  Why?
[02:32:00.151 --> 02:32:03.553]  Because he understands that NATO is an anachronism.
[02:32:04.413 --> 02:32:08.095]  Donald Trump understood that until he got this crop of advisors in.
[02:32:08.996 --> 02:32:11.217]  But clearly he understands that it's an anachronism.
[02:32:11.257 --> 02:32:14.418]  He doesn't really care if they let him into the European Union.
[02:32:14.479 --> 02:32:18.861]  So he's throwing a lot of insults at them because he's going to take over Europe.
[02:32:19.605 --> 02:32:20.745]  With a Muslim group.
[02:32:21.286 --> 02:32:43.632]  As I pointed out, this is a good example, as we look at the Turkish influence, we look at Fethullah Gulen here in this country, and the charter schools, he gets a half a billion dollars worth of taxpayer funds for charter schools, and they're not explicitly religious here like they are in other countries, but he's got about a thousand schools worldwide, and he's the opponent of Erdogan in Turkey, the civil war that's going on there.
[02:32:44.172 --> 02:32:48.694]  It's a good example of why we should not get involved in these foreign entanglements.
[02:32:49.494 --> 02:32:52.618]  Because as we see in Turkey, there isn't a good guy.
[02:32:53.419 --> 02:32:58.304]  We've got Erdogan and we've got Gulen, and they're both fighting over who's going to run a Muslim caliphate.
[02:32:59.686 --> 02:32:59.966]  Okay?
[02:33:00.066 --> 02:33:02.629]  Ataturk had created a secular
[02:33:03.652 --> 02:33:04.813]  Islamic State there.
[02:33:05.293 --> 02:33:09.376]  But he wants, Erdogan is moving it towards an Islamic State.
[02:33:09.837 --> 02:33:11.438]  And of course Fethullah Gulen is an imam.
[02:33:11.478 --> 02:33:14.000]  He wants to move it in that direction as well.
[02:33:14.800 --> 02:33:17.642]  And so, you know, we had an Ataturk who was there.
[02:33:17.702 --> 02:33:21.345]  He was kind of like Assad who defended Christians and religious freedom.
[02:33:21.405 --> 02:33:22.486]  But we can't have that.
[02:33:22.506 --> 02:33:23.547]  We've got to have regime change.
[02:33:24.167 --> 02:33:25.227]  We should be careful about that.
[02:33:25.508 --> 02:33:26.868]  Turkey is a good example of that.
[02:33:26.928 --> 02:33:28.869]  It's a country that we're not at war with.
[02:33:28.989 --> 02:33:35.872]  As a matter of fact, there's a lot of control and connections of Turks coming into this country.
[02:33:35.892 --> 02:33:37.293]  I mean, we were just talking to Lee Stranahan.
[02:33:37.333 --> 02:33:48.978]  He spent a good deal of time in Twin Falls, Idaho, looking at the Chobani yogurt situation there and the aftermath of some crimes that were done by immigrants who were brought in by various food companies there.
[02:33:49.538 --> 02:34:02.081]  And as he was doing that report, he found that the guy who owns Chobani Yogurt, a guy who got $700,000 from small business loans, we're talking about crony capitalism here, what did he do?
[02:34:02.101 --> 02:34:03.882]  He got $800,000 and he used $700,000 of it to lobby people like Chuck Schumer.
[02:34:09.474 --> 02:34:11.577]  And he now sits on the New York Fed.
[02:34:12.318 --> 02:34:16.504]  And when Lee called and said, is he a Turkish citizen still?
[02:34:16.544 --> 02:34:18.066]  They said, no comment.
[02:34:18.686 --> 02:34:26.918]  So, looks like we've got a Turkish citizen sitting on the New York Fed board, the most important policy Fed board that we have.
[02:34:27.418 --> 02:34:32.839]  Now today we had Donald Trump signing a Buy American, Hire American executive order.
[02:34:33.419 --> 02:34:36.680]  Part of this is to target the H-1B visa program.
[02:34:37.220 --> 02:34:39.741]  We have about 85,000 foreign workers who come to the U.S.
[02:34:39.841 --> 02:34:40.241]  each year.
[02:34:41.141 --> 02:34:51.403]  This is the visa program that sometimes brings in technical people that we can't get abroad, but quite often the people who come in with each H-1B visa programs are the people who were brought in by Disney.
[02:34:51.983 --> 02:34:53.626]  To replace the American workers.
[02:34:54.087 --> 02:34:55.209]  So he's putting a stop to that.
[02:34:55.529 --> 02:35:00.619]  He's putting in a buy American executive order for agencies to buy.
[02:35:03.894 --> 02:35:14.525]  Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network, and of course he's in law enforcement training group, and also a well-known respected private detective who becomes highly recommended over the years from our sources.
[02:35:14.945 --> 02:35:21.391]  He has FBI sources also, state police sources, and others in multiple states there on the East Coast.
[02:35:21.552 --> 02:35:22.913]  So Doug Hagman, thank you for joining us.
[02:35:22.993 --> 02:35:26.637]  You look at the battlefront worldwide, the globalist forces, we're in a war right now.
[02:35:27.317 --> 02:35:27.817]  Exactly.
[02:35:28.117 --> 02:35:28.957]  And that's part of it.
[02:35:29.297 --> 02:35:55.183]  And when I look at my side of things, on the domestic side, what I'm hearing from my FBI sources, one confirmation I got from both an FBI source as well as an agency source or a CIA source, saying watch the role of the National Geospatial Agency, the NGA, as well as the NSA in the upcoming days with respect to the leaks that had come out about the Trump administration, but also
[02:35:55.643 --> 02:36:01.487]  There's a lot of information that has yet to come out that will be dropped here within the next couple of weeks.
[02:36:01.527 --> 02:36:18.660]  There's more to come with respect to the allegations of not Donald Trump and the Russians, but the other members of the previous regime, Obama, Jarrett, in particular Valerie Jarrett with respect to Iran and Russia.
[02:36:18.780 --> 02:36:20.201]  We're about to have nuclear war, folks.
[02:36:20.281 --> 02:36:21.602]  It's time to arrest Hillary Clinton.
[02:36:21.923 --> 02:36:23.464]  We've got to save the country.
[02:36:23.744 --> 02:36:24.865]  The world's never been in more danger.
[02:36:25.465 --> 02:36:26.926]  They're the ones that made everything radical.
[02:36:27.147 --> 02:36:31.390]  Kim Jong-un, Hillary, all these other scumbags, Juncker, all of them need to be arrested.
[02:36:31.630 --> 02:36:32.691]  They're all calling for war.
[02:36:32.891 --> 02:36:34.312]  They're all involved in criminal activity.
[02:36:34.432 --> 02:36:35.153]  Arrest all of them.
[02:36:35.373 --> 02:36:35.834]  I'm serious.
[02:36:36.534 --> 02:36:44.939]  Yeah, no, 100% behind you because they brought us to this point and they have sold us out the Korean situation.
[02:36:45.039 --> 02:36:53.524]  So we've got this melting pot or this really sewage pot of strife worldwide.
[02:36:53.885 --> 02:36:57.467]  We got to this point because of Obama and right now...
[02:36:58.579 --> 02:37:13.529]  And Clinton, especially, and by the way, Hillary Clinton played a significant role under Madeleine Albright during the Clinton presidency as the shadow Secretary of State, to bring us to this point as well, and then moving on as Secretary of State under Obama.
[02:37:13.549 --> 02:37:19.593]  So, this has her fingerprints all over the place, and here we are, you know, at this level.
[02:37:19.633 --> 02:37:26.157]  So, there's much more to get into, but watch the next, really, 72 to 96 hours with respect to the taps.
[02:37:26.497 --> 02:37:30.626]  Why would they want to not have Russia on our side during this China crisis?
[02:37:31.207 --> 02:37:32.810]  Why are they trying to bring Russia down?
[02:37:33.956 --> 02:37:35.157]  Well, it's chaos.
[02:37:35.237 --> 02:37:36.478]  Operation Chaos, basically.
[02:37:37.058 --> 02:37:44.064]  This is the same playbook that we used, or that the Globals used back in the 60s, is being used today.
[02:37:44.224 --> 02:37:46.245]  And it's everybody against everybody.
[02:37:46.365 --> 02:37:52.770]  Let's destroy, let's burn the whole damn thing down and, you know, start it from scratch.
[02:37:53.611 --> 02:37:59.855]  It's very imprudent to do that, obviously, but these people that we're dealing with, as you pointed out, they're psychos.
[02:38:14.477 --> 02:38:16.578]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[02:38:17.138 --> 02:38:21.220]  Just want to point out before we get back to the news that we have our Easter Mega Special.
[02:38:21.740 --> 02:38:27.303]  We'll be ending tonight at Infowars.com and of course this is a wide variety of products that are 25 to 30% off.
[02:38:27.903 --> 02:38:32.365]  Things like Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine and of course our supply is getting very low on that.
[02:38:32.525 --> 02:38:40.069]  Once it ends, it's maybe a while before we can get that resupplied because we're having some difficulty getting the Deep Earth Iodine supply.
[02:38:40.774 --> 02:38:44.917]  Also, we have Super Male and Super Female Vitality, 25% off.
[02:38:45.417 --> 02:38:48.799]  Our Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink is 25% off.
[02:38:48.979 --> 02:39:00.626]  And Secret 12, our Vitamin B12 that you take sublingually, you put that right under your tongue, you don't have to take a painful injection to get the benefits of Vitamin B12, that is also 25% off.
[02:39:00.766 --> 02:39:03.027]  And Brain Force is 30% off.
[02:39:03.047 --> 02:39:05.609]  You'll find all those specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:39:05.989 --> 02:39:07.270]  We really appreciate your support.
[02:39:07.890 --> 02:39:17.115]  That's what makes the difference as we see Google with a double pincer of trying to shut down us accepting ads as well as us putting our ads.
[02:39:17.155 --> 02:39:20.757]  We got an ad for a vitamin supplement and they shut that down.
[02:39:21.257 --> 02:39:22.678]  How do you justify that?
[02:39:23.138 --> 02:39:27.541]  But then they tell us today when they look at the news, oh no no no, we're not focusing on InfoWars per se.
[02:39:28.086 --> 02:39:32.207]  No, we're just going to tell you which sites are trustworthy, which ones have a good reputation, which ones don't.
[02:39:32.508 --> 02:39:37.990]  You can trust CNN, but you can't trust Breitbart or InfoWars or Daily Caller or WorldNet Daily.
[02:39:38.310 --> 02:39:41.791]  You know, we're going to shut those guys down as a site.
[02:39:41.971 --> 02:39:45.472]  We're not even going to be the arbiters of truth of individual news stories.
[02:39:45.492 --> 02:39:47.153]  We're going to shut down the entire site.
[02:39:47.913 --> 02:40:00.523]  I was talking just before we went to the break about Trump's executive order to buy American, hire American that will require agencies to consider whether foreign governments are using unfair trade practices when considering the lowest responsible bidder.
[02:40:00.543 --> 02:40:04.026]  Well, I think that's good, but when we look at
[02:40:05.370 --> 02:40:07.531]  Let's take a look at the Export-Import Bank, for example.
[02:40:07.571 --> 02:40:15.716]  Last week we reported that in just 24 hours, Trump did a complete reversal on five core campaign issues.
[02:40:15.776 --> 02:40:27.202]  Things like China is a currency manipulator, NATO is now good, Janet Yellen is now good, we want the Federal Reserve to weaken our currency rather than telling China they need to stop manipulating their currency, that type of thing.
[02:40:27.222 --> 02:40:29.984]  But one of the things that he went to was the Export-Import Bank.
[02:40:30.984 --> 02:40:31.645]  Do you know what that is?
[02:40:32.782 --> 02:40:34.504]  We haven't really talked about that a lot.
[02:40:34.604 --> 02:40:36.145]  Some of the senators have talked about this.
[02:40:36.185 --> 02:40:39.408]  Some campaigned on it as part of the presidential campaign.
[02:40:39.969 --> 02:40:44.133]  Boeing and General Electric are very, very happy that Donald Trump wants to revive the export bank.
[02:40:44.173 --> 02:40:49.098]  What happened was, back in 2015, there was a great article from Reason Magazine at the time.
[02:40:49.138 --> 02:40:50.419]  They really spelled it out very simply.
[02:40:50.459 --> 02:40:50.759]  They said,
[02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:57.784]  For the first time in 81 years, Crony Capitalist Export-Import Bank loses its authorization.
[02:40:57.844 --> 02:41:05.870]  What happened was they had two members on the board get off and the Senate refused to replace them, which basically kept that from operating.
[02:41:06.310 --> 02:41:07.271]  Why would you want to do that?
[02:41:07.971 --> 02:41:13.515]  Well, this is something that goes back to FDR's New Deal, okay?
[02:41:13.655 --> 02:41:15.916]  And it is nothing but crony capitalism.
[02:41:15.936 --> 02:41:16.597]  Here's an example.
[02:41:17.981 --> 02:41:29.956]  They talk about how Boeing, and Boeing thinks it's a great deal that Trump's going to bring this back, Boeing is a recipient of 40% of what the Export-Import Bank has done.
[02:41:30.316 --> 02:41:32.539]  So 40% of what they do helps Boeing.
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:35.421]  It's supposed to help small business, right?
[02:41:36.802 --> 02:41:37.402]  Not in your life.
[02:41:38.003 --> 02:41:40.184]  It is the big business business.
[02:41:40.224 --> 02:41:41.465]  That's what they're in the business of.
[02:41:42.725 --> 02:41:50.830]  60% of the bank's financing aids go to just 10 giant corporations, like Caterpillar, Bechtel, GE that I pointed out, that pays no taxes.
[02:41:51.290 --> 02:41:55.793]  Jeffrey Immelt, who was one of Obama's favorite CEOs.
[02:41:56.753 --> 02:41:58.213]  They are the ones who are benefiting from this.
[02:41:58.333 --> 02:42:05.055]  And on the other side, so they extend low interest loans, subsidized by you, the taxpayer.
[02:42:05.075 --> 02:42:06.235]  Remember this on April 15th.
[02:42:06.495 --> 02:42:13.097]  You, the taxpayer, are putting up $140 billion to help these giant corporations do business abroad.
[02:42:13.537 --> 02:42:14.857]  Who is getting that money?
[02:42:15.477 --> 02:42:22.899]  Well, it's people like the Mexican government's oil and gas giant, Pemex, or the United Arab Emirates airline.
[02:42:24.006 --> 02:42:24.887]  Uh, Air Emirates.
[02:42:25.147 --> 02:42:31.631]  So we're subsidizing not only foreign corporations, but foreign state-owned corporations.
[02:42:32.331 --> 02:42:34.592]  How is that something that we want to do?
[02:42:34.652 --> 02:42:38.655]  And when we come back, I'm going to tell you about the two people that he wants to appoint to this board.
[02:42:38.695 --> 02:42:39.675]  You won't believe it.
[02:42:41.436 --> 02:42:42.797]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:42:42.837 --> 02:42:45.299]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:42:51.846 --> 02:42:55.189]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.
[02:42:55.409 --> 02:42:57.090]  Minor words and his was action.
[02:42:57.690 --> 02:42:59.211]  His was what he's done to women.
[02:42:59.251 --> 02:43:04.935]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[02:43:05.155 --> 02:43:07.457]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[02:43:07.817 --> 02:43:12.740]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
[02:43:12.820 --> 02:43:14.001]  Four of them here tonight.
[02:43:14.121 --> 02:43:19.425]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[02:43:30.270 --> 02:43:33.012]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[02:43:33.872 --> 02:43:35.333]  It's a fight for our minds.
[02:43:35.993 --> 02:43:37.934]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[02:43:38.254 --> 02:43:42.456]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:43:42.596 --> 02:43:45.938]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[02:43:46.018 --> 02:43:47.559]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:43:53.007 --> 02:43:57.130]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:43:57.631 --> 02:43:58.972]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:44:12.342 --> 02:44:14.523]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:44:14.984 --> 02:44:16.405]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:44:16.705 --> 02:44:20.128]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:44:23.648 --> 02:44:34.296]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, and we're going to be joining, actually, not going to be joining, but he's going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:44:34.316 --> 02:44:38.659]  Owen Shore will be coming on air in the next segment, hosting the fourth hour.
[02:44:38.679 --> 02:44:44.623]  I was talking about the Export-Import Bank, and this is one of the things that Donald Trump reversed himself on last week.
[02:44:44.663 --> 02:44:46.484]  He said it was corporate featherbedding.
[02:44:47.233 --> 02:45:03.583]  It was crony capitalism when he was running for president, but then last week, as the CNBC pointed out, he offered an olive branch to Democrats, the Democrats that are now in his cabinet, people like Gary Cohen, when he pledged to support the controversial Export-Import Bank last week.
[02:45:03.844 --> 02:45:06.725]  And they're looking at this and they're unhappy with the two picks that he had.
[02:45:06.765 --> 02:45:11.749]  Understand, this is an 81-year-old, New Deal, crony capitalist institution.
[02:45:12.947 --> 02:45:18.291]  Benefiting, in many cases, foreign-owned, state-owned corporations.
[02:45:19.052 --> 02:45:29.140]  Foreign governments own these corporations and we're extending them subsidized loans at the expense of you, the taxpayer, for the benefit of 10 giant corporations.
[02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:30.661]  That's what this is about, folks.
[02:45:31.262 --> 02:45:34.284]  And it stopped in 2015 because they had two vacancies.
[02:45:34.324 --> 02:45:36.045]  So they didn't have a quorum, they couldn't do anything.
[02:45:36.486 --> 02:45:38.027]  Now he's going to appoint a couple of people.
[02:45:38.067 --> 02:45:40.009]  So one of the people that he's talking about appointing
[02:45:40.749 --> 02:45:43.011]  As a guy who had always opposed it.
[02:45:43.271 --> 02:45:43.911]  Scott Garrett.
[02:45:43.991 --> 02:45:46.713]  He was part of the Freedom Caucus.
[02:45:46.853 --> 02:45:49.535]  And so CNBC says, well, we're not happy about this.
[02:45:49.595 --> 02:45:55.479]  This is another individual who's getting put into an agency that he thinks shouldn't exist.
[02:45:55.559 --> 02:45:56.840]  Well, I wish that were the case.
[02:45:56.900 --> 02:45:59.202]  Instead, what he says was, I think we can fix it.
[02:45:59.362 --> 02:46:00.422]  I think we can make it work.
[02:46:01.263 --> 02:46:02.904]  See, that's the Boromir flaw.
[02:46:03.004 --> 02:46:03.945]  You remember Lord of the Rings?
[02:46:03.965 --> 02:46:04.685]  Remember Boromir?
[02:46:04.886 --> 02:46:08.108]  He says, I can take that ring and I can do something really good with it.
[02:46:08.808 --> 02:46:09.409]  No, you can't.
[02:46:10.339 --> 02:46:11.159]  It will take you over.
[02:46:11.719 --> 02:46:15.941]  And we've seen, from the beginning of the federal income tax, how this monster has grown.
[02:46:15.961 --> 02:46:17.361]  And you can see it in every agency.
[02:46:17.381 --> 02:46:18.721]  The EPA is a good example of it.
[02:46:19.242 --> 02:46:22.582]  But the other person that he put in, CNBC thought was a great guy.
[02:46:23.163 --> 02:46:24.043]  Spencer Bacchus.
[02:46:24.183 --> 02:46:25.423]  They called him a moderate.
[02:46:25.523 --> 02:46:28.804]  Remember, when they liked the person, they called them a moderate or a centrist.
[02:46:29.184 --> 02:46:31.545]  Well, let's talk about this guy, Spencer Bacchus.
[02:46:32.165 --> 02:46:34.326]  Breitbart pointed out where this guy was coming from.
[02:46:34.986 --> 02:46:36.627]  They said Bacchus is a Republican.
[02:46:36.687 --> 02:46:43.649]  He holds the unenviable distinction of being the only politician that Andrew Breitbart called upon to resign when Andrew Breitbart was alive.
[02:46:44.269 --> 02:46:44.769]  What did he do?
[02:46:44.830 --> 02:46:51.112]  Well, he was chairman of the House Financial Services Committee during the 2008 financial crisis.
[02:46:52.393 --> 02:46:55.876]  And he was the epitome of insider trading.
[02:46:56.537 --> 02:46:58.218]  This is a guy I remember in September 18, 2008.
[02:46:59.779 --> 02:47:01.381]  We talked about this many times.
[02:47:01.441 --> 02:47:07.305]  Hank Paulson calls in the chair of the Fed, Ben Bernanke.
[02:47:07.866 --> 02:47:08.687]  They go to Capitol Hill.
[02:47:08.727 --> 02:47:15.973]  They call in all these senior congressmen, people like Spencer Bacchus, who is the House Financial Services Committee chair during that time.
[02:47:16.593 --> 02:47:22.267]  They tell them everything is going to collapse unless you do what we tell you to do.
[02:47:22.367 --> 02:47:25.355]  As a matter of fact, in this situation, they said it was a secretive meeting.
[02:47:26.038 --> 02:47:33.342]  What they did was they made all the congressmen put their phones away in the corner because they didn't want anybody recording the conversation or texting anybody about it.
[02:47:33.823 --> 02:47:38.065]  According to Paulson in his memoirs, he painted an apocalyptic vision of what was coming down the pike.
[02:47:38.105 --> 02:47:41.467]  He said, look, the stock market could lose half of its valuation.
[02:47:41.968 --> 02:47:44.369]  We could have a massive failure of banks, etc.
[02:47:44.949 --> 02:47:46.670]  That was on September 18th.
[02:47:47.291 --> 02:47:52.994]  The morning of September 19th, Spencer Bacchus knew what was coming and he went to the stock market.
[02:47:53.034 --> 02:47:53.935]  He took out $50,000 worth
[02:47:55.956 --> 02:47:56.617]  Of course!
[02:48:12.831 --> 02:48:14.012]  He made a fortune out of this.
[02:48:14.353 --> 02:48:21.460]  This is the guy that Donald Trump's administration, and I'm not necessarily blaming it on Trump, but the buck does stop with him.
[02:48:21.740 --> 02:48:23.662]  Maybe Gary Cohen putting this guy forward.
[02:48:23.682 --> 02:48:24.062]  I don't know.
[02:48:24.342 --> 02:48:24.903]  Jared Kushner.
[02:48:25.443 --> 02:48:26.164]  This crook.
[02:48:27.005 --> 02:48:27.485]  This crook.
[02:48:28.266 --> 02:48:28.986]  He should have stepped down.
[02:48:29.027 --> 02:48:29.847]  He should have been in jail.
[02:48:29.867 --> 02:48:35.650]  But of course, remember, Nancy Pelosi and all that lot said, oh no, insider trading, that's legal for Congress to do.
[02:48:36.331 --> 02:48:39.713]  As long as people are looking, they passed the Stock Act, said we're going to stop it.
[02:48:40.053 --> 02:48:42.034]  You noticed that we're doing insider trading.
[02:48:42.314 --> 02:48:44.035]  You got pretty upset about it, so we're going to stop it.
[02:48:44.776 --> 02:48:46.977]  A few months later, when nobody was looking, they undid it.
[02:48:47.397 --> 02:48:53.381]  And now one of the worst examples of this is being appointed to this crony capitalist export-import bank.
[02:48:54.001 --> 02:48:54.762]  What's going on here?
[02:48:55.839 --> 02:48:56.220]  I don't know.
[02:48:56.581 --> 02:48:57.002]  Stay with us.
[02:48:57.263 --> 02:48:58.988]  Owen Shorter is going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:48:59.008 --> 02:48:59.549]  He'll be right back.
[02:49:01.554 --> 02:49:07.898]  According to the mainstream media, President Donald Trump was mean to kids on Easter Sunday.
[02:49:08.098 --> 02:49:22.465]  That's right, dozens of news outlets ran with a misleading video that was spread by Politico yesterday, claiming that President Trump signed a Kids Make America Great Again hat and then threw it away from the kid into the crowd.
[02:49:22.726 --> 02:49:29.009]  The video quickly went viral, racking up nearly 10,000 retweets and getting picked up by other news outlets.
[02:49:29.409 --> 02:49:38.015]  The Washington Post reported Trump, using a thick sharpie, put his signature on the bill of the cap, then looked up and lobbed it into the crowd.
[02:49:38.375 --> 02:49:41.437]  Nowhere near the hand that had given it to him.
[02:49:41.997 --> 02:49:44.919]  BuzzFeed even claimed that the poor kid never got his hat back.
[02:49:45.219 --> 02:49:46.820]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:51.243]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[02:49:51.423 --> 02:49:52.524]  I was a total fitness nut.
[02:50:15.047 --> 02:50:15.508]  20 years ago.
[02:50:15.528 --> 02:50:18.651]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[02:50:18.751 --> 02:50:19.893]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[02:50:20.574 --> 02:50:23.156]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[02:50:24.118 --> 02:50:24.478]  Or more.
[02:50:24.558 --> 02:50:26.520]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[02:50:26.981 --> 02:50:28.462]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[02:50:28.563 --> 02:50:31.466]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[02:50:31.506 --> 02:50:32.127]  It's actually scary.
[02:50:34.669 --> 02:50:44.759]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.

[02:52:10.925 --> 02:52:13.450]  stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[02:52:13.530 --> 02:52:16.495]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:52:16.976 --> 02:52:19.781]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:52:22.276 --> 02:52:24.178]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show fourth hour.
[02:52:24.999 --> 02:52:37.450]  We've got some news to cover and you know right now where I'm sitting it feels like more people are nervous about World War III than ever before even when Barack Obama was in office.
[02:52:37.510 --> 02:52:44.857]  Now you can throw blame around and say who's guilty of what or this that or the other thing but it doesn't really matter does it if we go to World War III.
[02:52:44.937 --> 02:52:47.860]  No, I don't think that's good for anyone.
[02:52:49.068 --> 02:53:04.697]  And I'd like to know what you out there think about this, because part of me wants to start to be more critical of President Trump, and then another part of me says that's what the mainstream media wants, that's what the Democrats want, that's what the globalists want.
[02:53:05.277 --> 02:53:11.280]  And we know that they're all three working in collusion to try to bring down President Trump and try to stop our movement.
[02:53:12.381 --> 02:53:25.392]  It's a real, it's a real, it's some real thin ice that we're on right now as far as whether we should be supporting Trump gung-ho or whether we need to be looking at Trump and saying it's not looking good the directions he's going in.
[02:53:25.532 --> 02:53:27.514]  Or is there a line there between both?
[02:53:28.411 --> 02:53:30.153]  Uh, that I guess would be the most real thing.
[02:53:30.314 --> 02:53:32.436]  So I want to hear what you out there think.
[02:53:32.456 --> 02:53:32.617]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:53:32.637 --> 02:53:32.697]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:53:32.737 --> 02:53:34.719]  Is this the most you've ever been worried about World War III?
[02:53:44.311 --> 02:53:46.872]  Do you think it's a distraction from something else entirely?
[02:53:46.952 --> 02:53:49.153]  Are we missing the boat on something else entirely?
[02:53:49.854 --> 02:53:56.656]  We know how they love to do that, to try to distract us, but some of the developments today, I'm sure you've heard, the U.S.
[02:53:56.676 --> 02:54:01.438]  has deployed two more aircraft carriers towards the Korean Peninsula, and then
[02:54:02.799 --> 02:54:05.362]  At the same time, the same story was breaking.
[02:54:05.382 --> 02:54:05.422]  U.S.
[02:54:05.923 --> 02:54:09.166]  military considers shooting down North Korea missile tests.
[02:54:09.707 --> 02:54:12.991]  Okay, so you've got more aircraft carriers moving in that direction.
[02:54:13.031 --> 02:54:14.953]  You've got stories breaking about how the U.S.
[02:54:15.393 --> 02:54:17.836]  is considering shooting down North Korea missiles.
[02:54:18.157 --> 02:54:20.800]  North Korea is saying they're going to test missiles every week now.
[02:54:22.435 --> 02:54:26.477]  The US is drawing a line with North Korea, it appears, and they're not joking around.
[02:54:26.537 --> 02:54:33.220]  So, I mean, these are serious developments, and all signs point to something serious about to happen.
[02:54:33.260 --> 02:54:39.703]  I mean, they don't just send all these naval vessels and do all this saber-rattling if they don't plan on doing anything at all.
[02:54:41.104 --> 02:54:42.705]  And maybe China has balked.
[02:54:43.621 --> 02:54:47.463]  That's what a lot of people are saying, that China has kind of balked and they've blinked first.
[02:54:48.463 --> 02:54:49.984]  But North Korea has not.
[02:54:50.924 --> 02:54:59.748]  And I would assume, now I don't know if Donald Trump talks to anybody from Kim Jong-un's center of power.
[02:55:01.223 --> 02:55:08.547]  I would imagine that somebody from China is talking to those people, and that's why they had to turn that coal shipment around.
[02:55:09.128 --> 02:55:16.812]  But these are serious developments, and Trump has obviously pivoted on his China-rigging-their-currency rhetoric.
[02:55:17.272 --> 02:55:24.817]  Perhaps that was part of his quote-unquote 5D, 6DDD chess that he plays in order to win in Korea.
[02:55:24.857 --> 02:55:26.098]  But even with North Korea.
[02:55:27.768 --> 02:55:29.549]  My grandfather fought in the Korean War?
[02:55:29.849 --> 02:55:39.093]  I personally think that Trump is going for victory in North Korea to win major popularity points and just cruise towards victory in 2020.
[02:55:40.874 --> 02:55:43.436]  But I'd like to know what people out there think.
[02:55:43.496 --> 02:55:50.901]  Now, Roger Stone will be joining us at 2.30, 2.33 to be exact, in the show today.
[02:55:51.141 --> 02:55:55.425]  I'm sure he's got some breaking developments because he's actually going to be in studio with me.
[02:55:55.785 --> 02:55:57.866]  So we'll be hearing from Roger Stone shortly.
[02:55:58.487 --> 02:56:01.489]  But I'd like to hear from people out in the audience today.
[02:56:01.649 --> 02:56:04.051]  What do you think right now about World War III?
[02:56:04.151 --> 02:56:05.832]  What do you think right now about Trump?
[02:56:08.328 --> 02:56:15.912]  Do we continue to support him no matter what because the media, the Democrats and the globalists working in collusion want us divided more than anything?
[02:56:16.493 --> 02:56:23.957]  Or do we have to call it as we see it and in some instances support Trump and if we see an instance which we don't want to support Trump, call him out on it.
[02:56:24.077 --> 02:56:24.377]  I don't know.
[02:56:24.437 --> 02:56:27.119]  It's a very difficult path that we walk down right now.
[02:56:27.199 --> 02:56:29.480]  So let's go to some of our audience.
[02:56:29.500 --> 02:56:34.863]  Let's start with Uncle Sam in Louisiana who wants to talk about Trump's turnaround.
[02:56:35.343 --> 02:56:36.364]  Go ahead, Uncle Sam.
[02:56:38.191 --> 02:56:41.094]  Yes, good day.
[02:56:41.154 --> 02:56:43.377]  I do street interviews in the streets of New Orleans.
[02:56:44.178 --> 02:56:45.820]  Dress up in an Uncle Sam outfit.
[02:56:45.941 --> 02:56:48.824]  And for the past week, I've been asking people about Syria.
[02:56:49.345 --> 02:56:50.947]  You know, I think I've actually seen you before.
[02:56:51.067 --> 02:56:51.968]  Sorry for interrupting.
[02:56:51.988 --> 02:56:52.229]  Go ahead.
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:54.361]  No, I've been on the show.
[02:56:54.381 --> 02:56:57.002]  Kit Daniels did a profile.
[02:56:57.042 --> 02:56:57.823]  Okay, okay.
[02:56:58.083 --> 02:56:58.323]  Yeah.
[02:56:58.403 --> 02:57:04.307]  And you guys have actually been from some of the interviews, because I've talked to colonels and cardinals out there in the streets.
[02:57:05.028 --> 02:57:10.271]  And some of the things I've heard recently, I just spoke to a man who followed around.
[02:57:10.451 --> 02:57:14.193]  He was the first communique for President Clinton.
[02:57:14.473 --> 02:57:16.615]  He heard every conversation for three years.
[02:57:17.075 --> 02:57:18.996]  The things he told me, I can't really.
[02:57:19.597 --> 02:57:21.438]  So let's get into what you think about Trump, though.
[02:57:22.721 --> 02:57:22.881]  Hmm.
[02:57:22.901 --> 02:57:23.001]  Yeah.
[02:57:40.563 --> 02:57:47.846]  I mean, we're looking at this, he's obviously, I mean, he was serious, just got me twisted big.
[02:57:48.366 --> 02:57:51.768]  You know it, I know it, all the information, the people listening know it.
[02:57:52.188 --> 02:57:58.010]  But you know, just to add something to that, it's like he's sleeping with the enemy while they're both stabbing each other in the back constantly.
[02:57:58.030 --> 02:58:01.552]  And this is the weirdest thing, I mean, I don't know, go ahead.
[02:58:03.325 --> 02:58:10.516]  Yeah, but I mean, the people that I've been speaking to on the streets, they're puzzled.
[02:58:11.077 --> 02:58:13.240]  I mean, no one can put a real finger on this.
[02:58:13.540 --> 02:58:15.343]  It's so fluid.
[02:58:15.443 --> 02:58:18.548]  It's like all the pieces are falling apart in every different direction.
[02:58:18.588 --> 02:58:18.949]  You can't
[02:58:19.409 --> 02:58:20.890]  You can't keep track of any of it.
[02:58:20.970 --> 02:58:21.470]  And you know what?
[02:58:21.550 --> 02:58:31.356]  I think that the biggest problem that we all have, and I'm speaking for myself, I suppose, but it just feels like right now, you know, my biggest thing was drain the swamp, right?
[02:58:31.416 --> 02:58:32.156]  Drain the swamp.
[02:58:32.216 --> 02:58:33.377]  Get in there like a wrecking ball.
[02:58:33.657 --> 02:58:36.939]  And he's been great for domestic policy, but drain the swamp?
[02:58:37.579 --> 02:58:37.899]  Hmm.
[02:58:39.140 --> 02:58:40.521]  I'm not sure if I'm buying that.
[02:58:42.702 --> 02:58:45.303]  Yeah, I mean, you want to get a wrecking ball?
[02:58:45.323 --> 02:58:46.244]  We got a bowling ball.
[02:58:47.219 --> 02:58:49.021]  Yeah, I think that that's another good analogy.
[02:58:49.081 --> 02:58:50.682]  Alright, Uncle Sam, thank you so much for the call.
[02:58:50.722 --> 02:58:54.865]  Let's move on to Russell, who is in Texas, also wants to talk Trump.
[02:58:54.906 --> 02:58:55.586]  Go ahead, Russell.
[02:58:56.807 --> 02:58:59.189]  Hey, it's a real honor to speak with you.
[02:58:59.209 --> 02:59:01.811]  I listen to you all day every day, so thank you there.
[02:59:03.213 --> 02:59:09.578]  I just wanted to say that Trump, when he was running, now he's a good man, got a good heart,
[02:59:10.373 --> 02:59:12.755]  You know, he's not a politician.
[02:59:12.815 --> 02:59:13.656]  He didn't get into it.
[02:59:13.696 --> 02:59:14.437]  Oh, he is now.
[02:59:14.457 --> 02:59:15.277]  He wanted money.
[02:59:15.938 --> 02:59:18.420]  Well, he is now, but that wasn't his motivation.
[02:59:18.480 --> 02:59:19.721]  He just loves our country.
[02:59:20.322 --> 02:59:28.048]  So with that being said, once he got in, he now sees the dynamics like the world stage, how the powers work together.
[02:59:28.068 --> 02:59:31.071]  You know, he can't just do things on his own.
[02:59:31.171 --> 02:59:35.355]  I understand with the world government, but he has to play the game as it is.
[02:59:35.976 --> 02:59:43.481]  Now, he has a good heart and he's going to do what's best for us, but some avenues have to be gone through a certain way.
[02:59:43.841 --> 02:59:50.286]  See, I hear what you're saying, and I hear this a lot, and there's certainly some potentiality in what you're talking about.
[02:59:50.366 --> 02:59:53.047]  It's just, I have a problem.
[02:59:53.067 --> 03:00:01.293]  I don't want to be like the Obama supporters that just looked like the biggest dumbasses for eight years, I guess, is how I'm putting it.
[03:00:02.617 --> 03:00:09.944]  I don't want to be the person that just continues to fall hook, line, and sinker for whatever Trump says because I believe in some overarching agenda that I think we agree on.
[03:00:11.345 --> 03:00:12.867]  I'm just not seeing that right now.
[03:00:13.387 --> 03:00:15.349]  That's just how I feel, and a lot of people feel the same way.
[03:00:15.609 --> 03:00:20.814]  Other people think this is divide, that people are trying to divide us right now, and I don't know.
[03:00:20.874 --> 03:00:22.556]  There's a lot of things that Trump's doing that's good.
[03:00:22.576 --> 03:00:25.619]  There's a lot of things that Trump and his administration that have done that are not good.
[03:00:27.594 --> 03:00:32.278]  He sees the way that conservatives and libertarians think.
[03:00:32.459 --> 03:00:35.721]  They think on a whole other level than liberals do.
[03:00:36.202 --> 03:00:41.026]  The liberals are watching TV, getting their news, believing headlines and topics.
[03:00:41.567 --> 03:00:47.292]  We actually listen to the facts, listen to the sources, and Trump's no different than that.
[03:00:47.352 --> 03:00:50.235]  So all I'm saying is, yes, he's a regular person.
[03:00:50.275 --> 03:00:51.416]  He can make mistakes.
[03:00:52.006 --> 03:00:55.409]  But he doesn't have an agenda to sell us out.
[03:00:55.469 --> 03:01:01.933]  He took a lot of trouble and heat and turned his life upside down.
[03:01:02.274 --> 03:01:04.855]  I will say this, I will say this.
[03:01:07.017 --> 03:01:14.783]  If the United States ends up in more Middle Eastern intervention because of an oil pipeline, that to me is selling the American people out.
[03:01:15.603 --> 03:01:16.184]  Absolutely.
[03:01:18.234 --> 03:01:18.975]  110%.
[03:01:18.254 --> 03:01:18.975]  Because you know why?
[03:01:19.315 --> 03:01:20.556]  Because you know what happens then?
[03:01:21.057 --> 03:01:30.406]  We then go into the Middle East, we intervene in the Middle East, we bomb the Middle East into oblivion, and then those people end up hating us, and then you have ISIS, with the help of our own government and proxy wars as well.
[03:01:30.686 --> 03:01:35.251]  So it's a very vicious circle that we were hoping Trump would put a stop to.
[03:01:35.291 --> 03:01:38.253]  We would hope Trump would get in there and stop those gears up.
[03:01:39.074 --> 03:01:56.460]  And whether it be because he's getting bad intel, whether it be because he has no choice, maybe he's blackmailed, I don't know, but the gears just keep on rolling and he was the candidate that said he didn't want to get into World War III, now here we are basically playing World War Chicken with North Korea and China and the Middle East.
[03:01:58.015 --> 03:02:00.596]  You said that earlier, that he might not have a choice.
[03:02:00.676 --> 03:02:08.599]  I mean, if you were to be in the White House yourself, common sense is going to rule most of what you do, not corruption because you're paid off.
[03:02:09.079 --> 03:02:17.623]  But he's having to face off real threats, and he might have information saying, look, these guys are just going to pop a shot off at us or whatever.
[03:02:18.283 --> 03:02:20.285]  You know, he's got to defend us.
[03:02:20.325 --> 03:02:21.686]  He's got to do what he's got to do.
[03:02:21.786 --> 03:02:23.067]  I hope it doesn't happen.
[03:02:23.107 --> 03:02:27.090]  And I'm sure if he has a say in it, it ain't going to happen.
[03:02:27.210 --> 03:02:34.696]  I would not think that it's because he just wants to be tough or... But we have to ask, thank you for the call, Russell.
[03:02:34.716 --> 03:02:36.897]  We have to ask, what is the big deal with North Korea now?
[03:02:36.957 --> 03:02:38.799]  Why all the saber-rattling with North Korea?
[03:02:38.959 --> 03:02:40.140]  What is driving this?
[03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:42.682]  Is it Trump going for victory in North Korea?
[03:02:43.442 --> 03:02:51.825]  Or is it the globalists stirring up this distraction or stirring up Trump to force intervention, to force World War III to divide Trump's base?
[03:02:52.565 --> 03:02:53.545]  I don't know what's going on.
[03:02:53.585 --> 03:02:55.026]  Again, you just have to ask why.
[03:02:55.106 --> 03:02:55.526]  I don't know.
[03:02:55.726 --> 03:02:57.207]  I'm not going to find this out.
[03:02:57.227 --> 03:02:58.047]  They're not going to tell us.
[03:02:58.467 --> 03:03:02.048]  Let's go to Fred in Wisconsin who wants to talk about World War III.
[03:03:02.068 --> 03:03:02.668]  Go ahead, Fred.
[03:03:03.008 --> 03:03:04.189]  You've got 60 seconds.
[03:03:04.229 --> 03:03:04.649]  Make it quick.
[03:03:05.939 --> 03:03:15.529]  Hey, I think the problem here is that South Korea is trying to install the THAAD system, which is a major radar, which is going to piss off both Russia and China.
[03:03:16.089 --> 03:03:22.116]  And now, back in May of 2014, we had the Donald Cook attacked with an EMP weapon, which completely disabled it.
[03:03:22.776 --> 03:03:24.658]  27 soldiers, you know, resigned.
[03:03:25.119 --> 03:03:25.819]  I think the major
[03:03:27.434 --> 03:03:33.999]  I'll put it to you this way.
[03:03:34.039 --> 03:03:34.979]  I'll put it to you this way.
[03:03:35.079 --> 03:03:35.880]  I'll put it to you this way.
[03:03:35.960 --> 03:03:42.265]  I think that Russia is the biggest story or the biggest story because I don't think Russia is going to take the United States BS anymore.
[03:03:42.665 --> 03:03:47.749]  I think Russia will finally stand up to United States government forcing oil wars on the rest of the world.
[03:03:47.809 --> 03:03:49.230]  That's, I don't know, that could be the case.
[03:03:49.450 --> 03:03:51.552]  We'll be right back on the other side, Alex Jones, fourth hour.
[03:04:01.269 --> 03:04:01.409]  What?
[03:04:01.870 --> 03:04:10.900]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:04:10.980 --> 03:04:19.069]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:04:19.369 --> 03:04:24.052]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:04:24.252 --> 03:04:30.937]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:04:31.037 --> 03:04:38.122]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:04:38.202 --> 03:04:45.086]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:04:45.246 --> 03:04:49.189]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:04:49.229 --> 03:04:49.589]  I think so.
[03:05:06.667 --> 03:05:13.130]  Russia unveiled a Satan-2 missile that could wipe out France or Texas with the type of megaton weapons it carries.
[03:05:13.450 --> 03:05:14.431]  Multiple ones, by the way.
[03:05:14.451 --> 03:05:16.852]  And of course, there's a lot more advanced stuff than that.
[03:05:16.872 --> 03:05:25.336]  They've been in the Air Force by the 90s, developed anti-matter bombs that would destroy, if they theoretically tested them, they would destroy most of the solar system.
[03:05:26.236 --> 03:05:27.097]  What's the point of that?
[03:05:27.677 --> 03:05:28.017]  I don't know.
[03:05:28.618 --> 03:05:32.060]  But we're reaching that Atlantis moment, whether Atlantis existed or not.
[03:05:32.600 --> 03:05:37.143]  In the fable of Atlantis, the legend, they get some super technology that blows the whole island up.
[03:05:37.804 --> 03:05:40.706]  And Plato, who lived only, you know, a few thousand years after, he said no.
[03:05:41.006 --> 03:05:42.367]  He had the animals, the books about it.
[03:05:42.587 --> 03:05:42.987]  It happened.
[03:05:43.007 --> 03:05:46.029]  But whether that was real or not, folks, we're now at the Atlantis moment.
[03:05:46.329 --> 03:05:48.471]  Michael Snyder, you know, I don't know if you have kids.
[03:05:48.511 --> 03:05:50.532]  I have children, especially my little daughters.
[03:05:50.652 --> 03:05:54.455]  And I see this news, and I see how sweet they are, and it really makes me angry.
[03:05:56.204 --> 03:05:58.027]  Yeah, I don't want war either, Alex.
[03:05:58.107 --> 03:06:00.571]  And that's why I'm so alarmed by what's happened this week.
[03:06:00.591 --> 03:06:04.276]  We already talked about how North Korea could potentially spark a war with China.
[03:06:04.316 --> 03:06:07.541]  Well, the situation with Syria, if it was just Syria, wouldn't be that big of a deal.
[03:06:07.722 --> 03:06:10.386]  And Trump could do whatever he wanted if it was just Syria.
[03:06:10.726 --> 03:06:11.808]  But the Russians are there.
[03:06:12.208 --> 03:06:16.832]  And the Russians are mixed in among the Syrian forces and they're at the Syrian air bases in particular.
[03:06:17.172 --> 03:06:26.378]  So Trump, with his words and the members of his administration in recent days, they've kind of committed themselves to taking some sort of action in response to this false flag chemical attack.
[03:06:26.659 --> 03:06:28.020]  But they've kind of committed themselves.
[03:06:28.060 --> 03:06:36.526]  But if they do anything and the bombs start dropping and the Russians, their people are being killed, their force is under threat, are the Russians just going to sit there and do nothing?
[03:06:36.846 --> 03:06:37.967]  Or are they going to respond?
[03:06:38.347 --> 03:06:39.908]  I believe the Russians would start responding.
[03:06:39.928 --> 03:06:40.969]  They would start shooting back.
[03:06:41.129 --> 03:06:43.630]  And so what happens if, okay, U.S.
[03:06:43.670 --> 03:06:48.952]  warplanes go in, they start bombing, and then Russian missiles, the S-300 starts taking U.S.
[03:06:49.032 --> 03:06:53.214]  airplanes out, we start seeing F-16s fall out of the sky on CNN.
[03:06:53.494 --> 03:06:58.516]  What's that going to do to the anti-Russian hysteria in Washington that's already at Cold War heights?
[03:06:58.876 --> 03:07:00.236]  I mean, it's just going to be insane.
[03:07:00.537 --> 03:07:07.439]  But you have this situation, and of course we've got Iran in Syria, we've got Hezbollah in Syria, and there's nothing to be gained in there.
[03:07:07.519 --> 03:07:09.360]  You know, there's so much that could go wrong.
[03:07:09.580 --> 03:07:11.141]  We don't want a conflict with Iran.
[03:07:11.161 --> 03:07:13.283]  We don't even want a conflict with Hezbollah.
[03:07:13.303 --> 03:07:14.504]  They're pretty serious.
[03:07:14.825 --> 03:07:16.166]  But especially with Russia.
[03:07:16.286 --> 03:07:18.768]  Our relationship with Russia is already quite tenuous.
[03:07:19.328 --> 03:07:27.876]  And if we go in and dead bodies of Russian service members start showing up on Russian television, you know, the Russians are going to totally turn against Trump.
[03:07:29.677 --> 03:07:31.218]  Yeah, Russia doesn't back down.
[03:07:31.278 --> 03:07:32.919]  Russia is not intimidated by anyone.
[03:07:33.279 --> 03:07:35.200]  The Russians, historically, are fighters.
[03:07:35.220 --> 03:07:38.522]  And so, you know, we had hoped that with Trump coming in, we could have a better relationship with Russia.
[03:07:38.542 --> 03:07:41.364]  But this thing with Syria could actually make it far, far worse.
[03:08:04.676 --> 03:08:24.627]  Boy, I hope that song isn't about what I was talking about.
[03:08:24.647 --> 03:08:28.169]  I hope you guys didn't play that on purpose, because that's how you feel about Trump.
[03:08:28.529 --> 03:08:29.750]  I just got handed this story.
[03:08:30.765 --> 03:08:36.990]  From foxnews.com, North Korean commandos ready to kidnap Americans says defector.
[03:08:37.490 --> 03:08:43.735]  It goes on and says that Kim Jong-un has admitted to kidnapping Japanese people on and on about how bad Kim Jong-un is.
[03:08:44.456 --> 03:08:48.359]  So I guess I'm supposed to buy this then and agree to World War III then.
[03:08:48.579 --> 03:08:50.521]  I guess that that's how that's going to work.
[03:08:50.781 --> 03:08:51.722]  That seems to be the trend.
[03:08:53.803 --> 03:09:04.367]  Look folks, Kim Jong-un is obviously a crazy dictator, and if we're going to virtue signal and play police of the world, you would think that North Korea would have been the main focal point.
[03:09:04.387 --> 03:09:11.449]  Well, you know, there's no really political leverage to be gained there, there's no economic leverage, there's no oil, so we've just kind of remained disinterested.
[03:09:11.869 --> 03:09:15.911]  Now Trump is all of a sudden in office, and now all of a sudden we want to do something about North Korea.
[03:09:16.191 --> 03:09:22.233]  Of course, the North Korea, South Korea, and the United States being involved in those wars never really ended, did it?
[03:09:22.853 --> 03:09:24.514]  So what is really driving this?
[03:09:24.594 --> 03:09:27.434]  What is truly driving this?
[03:09:27.454 --> 03:09:34.176]  I mean, I guess the United States essentially trying to bully Kim Jong-un out of power?
[03:09:34.196 --> 03:09:40.458]  I guess that's what they're trying to do, and then maybe make a deal with China so that they can get them to cooperate?
[03:09:41.199 --> 03:09:41.539]  I don't know.
[03:09:41.659 --> 03:09:42.859]  I don't want World War III.
[03:09:43.659 --> 03:09:48.981]  I certainly don't want Kim Jong-un remaining a dictator in Korea anymore, in North Korea anymore, but
[03:09:49.955 --> 03:09:50.776]  Yeah, so there's the story.
[03:09:50.836 --> 03:09:55.098]  North Korea has been kidnapping people for literally decades for various reasons.
[03:09:55.719 --> 03:09:58.400]  Okay, yeah, and what about our government that does the same crap?
[03:10:00.221 --> 03:10:00.662]  I'm sorry.
[03:10:01.482 --> 03:10:08.507]  It's just, it's just, it's just so hard to sit here and cover all this when I know my government's been one of the most corrupt governments in the world for my entire life!
[03:10:08.787 --> 03:10:12.009]  And just because Trump gets in doesn't mean I'm supposed to forget about it!
[03:10:13.837 --> 03:10:15.862]  Please actually drain the swamp, Trump!
[03:10:16.263 --> 03:10:20.654]  Excuse me, let's go to Berger in California, who wants to talk about World War III.
[03:10:20.915 --> 03:10:22.117]  Trump said he didn't want to get us there.
[03:10:22.138 --> 03:10:23.240]  Go ahead, Berger.
[03:10:24.272 --> 03:10:25.652]  All right, Troyer, this is it, man.
[03:10:25.673 --> 03:10:28.694]  Y'all doing a good job at InfoWars, but this is the whole plan, man.
[03:10:29.054 --> 03:10:37.116]  We have been invaded by the British Empire, and what they are doing is they want the military stretched so thin, and they want to die in this war.
[03:10:37.176 --> 03:10:38.177]  This is what's going to happen.
[03:10:38.377 --> 03:10:42.298]  You got three aircraft carriers over there in the sea right now.
[03:10:42.858 --> 03:10:44.919]  If that happens, it's going to be devastating.
[03:10:45.179 --> 03:10:48.960]  We got troops trapped over there in the Middle East, okay?
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:49.621]  This is what it is.
[03:10:49.701 --> 03:10:50.721]  It's a white man war.
[03:10:51.321 --> 03:10:52.201]  This is what happened.
[03:10:52.682 --> 03:10:55.203]  It's the invasion of the British Empire, plain and simple.
[03:10:55.283 --> 03:10:58.764]  If you look at why the country was created, it's going to take plain and simple.
[03:10:59.064 --> 03:11:04.206]  We are facing the same things with the TSA, the false flags, the 9-11, everything.
[03:11:04.266 --> 03:11:05.127]  This is what it is.
[03:11:05.207 --> 03:11:06.247]  We have been invaded.
[03:11:07.988 --> 03:11:09.388]  Alright, thank you for the call, Berger.
[03:11:09.489 --> 03:11:11.629]  Yeah, I haven't heard that theory before.
[03:11:11.669 --> 03:11:12.630]  That's certainly a new one.
[03:11:13.010 --> 03:11:15.031]  Let's go to Michael in New Jersey.
[03:11:16.051 --> 03:11:17.072]  Also wants to talk about war.
[03:11:17.132 --> 03:11:17.732]  Go ahead, Michael.
[03:11:19.265 --> 03:11:19.845]  I knew it!
[03:11:49.201 --> 03:11:51.142]  But does that mean that Donald Trump knew it?
[03:11:51.763 --> 03:11:55.605]  He only knows if he hires generals and CIA... Well, here's the deal.
[03:11:55.625 --> 03:11:56.666]  Just to clear the air on this.
[03:11:56.946 --> 03:11:59.488]  With the whole Syria thing, I don't think... I think Trump knew it.
[03:11:59.508 --> 03:12:00.208]  Of course he knew it.
[03:12:00.749 --> 03:12:01.609]  His generals knew it.
[03:12:02.190 --> 03:12:10.335]  They lied about it for an agenda, whether that agenda was to remove Assad from power or whether to test missiles before they go to war in North Korea.
[03:12:10.615 --> 03:12:11.156]  I don't know.
[03:12:11.256 --> 03:12:11.916]  That's the debate.
[03:12:12.537 --> 03:12:13.097]  Now, go on.
[03:12:13.217 --> 03:12:14.198]  You said you had another point.
[03:12:14.218 --> 03:12:14.578]  Go ahead.
[03:12:14.598 --> 03:12:15.659]  Korea.
[03:12:16.099 --> 03:12:17.340]  The Korean issue.
[03:12:17.887 --> 03:12:19.147]  We live under martial law.
[03:12:19.367 --> 03:12:34.151]  At some level, I would think that I, you, InfoWars, and others would be thrilled to figure out the resolution so we can stop flying the yellow-trimmed flags in every public building, in every school in America.
[03:12:34.171 --> 03:12:42.933]  It doesn't matter how many times I sit down with my congressman, Lo Biando, who's on the House Armed Services Committee, and the
[03:12:44.651 --> 03:12:48.993]  The committee that oversees the NSA, I can talk till I'm blue in the face.
[03:12:49.053 --> 03:12:53.114]  I call him two times a day and hound his ass on these issues.
[03:12:53.494 --> 03:12:58.676]  The fact remains that we had a cessation of hostilities.
[03:12:59.536 --> 03:13:02.618]  We didn't sign a peace treaty and end the Korean War.
[03:13:03.018 --> 03:13:09.240]  Now we have two presidents prior who sat there and did not a damn thing.
[03:13:09.784 --> 03:13:11.946]  Well, most dangerous to who?
[03:13:11.986 --> 03:13:15.148]  You know, I mean, that statement is very relative.
[03:13:15.468 --> 03:13:17.229]  Is North Korea the most dangerous nation to you?
[03:13:22.845 --> 03:13:23.165]  No.
[03:13:23.466 --> 03:13:25.447]  Is North Korea the most dangerous nation to me?
[03:13:25.467 --> 03:13:25.507]  No.
[03:13:27.389 --> 03:13:31.592]  So is North Korea the most dangerous nation to South Korea and North Korea and Japan?
[03:13:31.993 --> 03:13:32.373]  Yes.
[03:13:32.513 --> 03:13:32.893]  Okay.
[03:13:33.554 --> 03:13:42.041]  So maybe we should start prioritizing these wars we get involved to and let's just maybe get an honest admission as to what our agenda is with our foreign policy.
[03:13:42.061 --> 03:13:42.461]  That'd be nice.
[03:13:42.741 --> 03:13:44.683]  Roger Stone joining us on the other side.
[03:13:44.723 --> 03:13:45.323]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:13:45.343 --> 03:13:46.504]  Fourth Hour Alex Jones Show.
[03:13:50.228 --> 03:13:53.214]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:13:54.156 --> 03:13:56.821]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:14:01.981 --> 03:14:09.726]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[03:14:09.946 --> 03:14:16.369]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:14:16.609 --> 03:14:24.894]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[03:14:25.174 --> 03:14:33.943]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:14:34.183 --> 03:14:39.929]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:14:40.269 --> 03:14:40.729]  It works.
[03:14:41.030 --> 03:14:49.275]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[03:14:49.475 --> 03:14:58.881]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWareStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the InfoWare against the globalists all at the same time.
[03:14:59.241 --> 03:14:59.721]  A total 360 win.
[03:15:02.981 --> 03:15:08.304]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:15:08.464 --> 03:15:09.044]  I take this.
[03:15:09.304 --> 03:15:10.345]  My family takes this.
[03:15:10.445 --> 03:15:14.687]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:15:14.727 --> 03:15:19.169]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:15:19.329 --> 03:15:23.891]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:15:23.971 --> 03:15:25.012]  I don't feel good.
[03:15:25.092 --> 03:15:28.613]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:15:28.853 --> 03:15:31.494]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:15:31.554 --> 03:15:36.857]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:15:37.337 --> 03:15:39.738]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:15:40.298 --> 03:15:43.720]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:15:43.840 --> 03:15:46.021]  So obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[03:15:46.081 --> 03:15:46.441]  I love it.
[03:15:46.601 --> 03:15:49.204]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:15:49.404 --> 03:15:50.365]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:15:50.405 --> 03:15:56.351]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:15:56.371 --> 03:15:57.993]  It's got a five-star rating.

[03:16:01.926 --> 03:16:03.307]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:16:03.587 --> 03:16:04.869]  You can't survive without it.
[03:16:05.069 --> 03:16:05.970]  But where do you get it?
[03:16:06.270 --> 03:16:12.035]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:16:12.255 --> 03:16:17.980]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[03:17:28.631 --> 03:17:29.613]  But people love sales.
[03:17:29.633 --> 03:17:30.353]  I love sales.
[03:17:31.724 --> 03:17:33.005]  And it helps fund our operation.
[03:17:33.045 --> 03:17:35.747]  At least if a lot of people take advantage of the sale, then it does.
[03:17:36.627 --> 03:17:42.951]  If we have a big sale and cut prices down to almost no profit, and then people don't take advantage of it, then we actually lose money.
[03:17:43.232 --> 03:17:46.013]  We need to fund ourselves, fund this operation.
[03:17:46.033 --> 03:17:48.115]  30% off BrainForce, the great nootropic.

[03:18:23.959 --> 03:18:25.601]  We should get more in the next few weeks.
[03:18:25.681 --> 03:18:26.742]  It's 25% off.

[03:18:36.513 --> 03:18:37.053]  We're good to go.
[03:18:56.638 --> 03:19:02.424]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, let's now hand the baton to David Knight right here in the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:19:19.707 --> 03:19:21.167]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:21.247 --> 03:19:24.849]  Owen Schroeder now joined in studio by Roger Stone.
[03:19:24.909 --> 03:19:32.851]  An honor to be joined by Roger and you've got a piece that's about to be, it actually might be up on Infowars.com right now, breaking down the latest on Mike Pompeo.
[03:19:33.191 --> 03:19:37.332]  He's for Wikileaks, he's anti-Wikileaks, he's spinning himself in a circle, Roger.
[03:19:37.352 --> 03:19:41.774]  This is deeply disappointing to me, Owen, because
[03:19:43.394 --> 03:19:59.585]  The Central Intelligence Agency and the vaunted 17 agencies we keep hearing about have systematically leaked in an attempt to destabilize the president, first delegitimize his election, and then destabilize him.
[03:20:00.886 --> 03:20:02.887]  And it's clear that the place needs reform.
[03:20:03.007 --> 03:20:10.572]  They need to wipe out the whole second and third levels who continue to be Obama appointees.
[03:20:12.333 --> 03:20:21.867]  Mike Pompeo seems to be buying the BS narrative of the careerists, the neocons, at the Central Intelligence Agency.
[03:20:22.788 --> 03:20:27.996]  And he blurted out last Friday that WikiLeaks is a Russian asset.
[03:20:29.031 --> 03:20:39.914]  So, in all, to be completely reasonable, I would give Mr. Pompeo a reasonable amount of time, say five days, to either produce proof of this outrageous claim or resign.
[03:20:39.934 --> 03:20:42.775]  Because that's not consistent with Donald Trump's view.
[03:20:42.915 --> 03:20:45.716]  Donald Trump said, and I quote, I love WikiLeaks.
[03:20:46.756 --> 03:20:54.839]  There's no evidence whatsoever of Julian Assange being an asset for the Russian state.
[03:20:56.085 --> 03:20:59.627]  The intelligence services keep repeating this because they need it to be true.
[03:21:00.428 --> 03:21:15.957]  If it's not true, well then, ultimately, and there is no Russian collusion, we're going to learn that the president was under surveillance, or his aides were under surveillance, and he was caught up by it, at a minimum, for strictly political reasons.
[03:21:16.917 --> 03:21:18.458]  That's Watergate times 10.
[03:21:18.538 --> 03:21:22.401]  That's spying on the Republican nominee for president.
[03:21:23.595 --> 03:21:25.197]  Mr. Pompeo should know better.
[03:21:25.858 --> 03:21:28.663]  It's clear to me that the agency is going to run him.
[03:21:29.004 --> 03:21:30.466]  He cannot run the agency.
[03:21:30.586 --> 03:21:31.948]  I frankly think he ought to resign.
[03:21:32.520 --> 03:21:46.763]  You know, and it's stories like this that remind me about how there's a divide tactic being worked by the deep state, by the media, the Democrats, the globalists, all working in collusion to try to divide Trump's base and defeat him in 2020.
[03:21:46.803 --> 03:21:49.664]  I think that that's part of this agenda.
[03:21:50.184 --> 03:21:55.825]  And it's almost amazing, you know, you say that Pompeo needs to produce the evidence that he claims
[03:21:56.505 --> 03:21:59.487]  That WikiLeaks is a Russian asset, he would have that ability.
[03:21:59.988 --> 03:22:04.351]  So he should be able to, within five days, actually prove that statement true.
[03:22:04.771 --> 03:22:06.232]  If not, I would assume it's false.
[03:22:06.693 --> 03:22:07.813]  And what would you think about this?
[03:22:08.094 --> 03:22:14.939]  It appears to me that at this point in time that the drain, the swamp, it's time for that to become more than just rhetoric.
[03:22:14.959 --> 03:22:17.341]  He needs to really drain the swamp immediately.
[03:22:18.081 --> 03:22:21.202]  Well, I guess I would make two points.
[03:22:21.422 --> 03:22:26.824]  One, look at the actual quote from the FBI Director, Mr. Comey, in front of the House Intelligence Committee.
[03:22:26.864 --> 03:22:34.947]  When he's asked, have you been able to ascertain with certainty that WikiLeaks is a Russian operation?
[03:22:35.008 --> 03:22:41.290]  He says, well, it is our assessment that they've used some kind of cutout.
[03:22:42.937 --> 03:22:48.663]  When anybody from an intelligence agency says assessment, that's the buzzword.
[03:22:48.723 --> 03:22:50.384]  That means they don't know crap.
[03:22:50.484 --> 03:22:51.726]  That they don't know anything.
[03:22:51.766 --> 03:22:54.128]  It's a projection of what they want you to believe.
[03:22:54.989 --> 03:22:55.990]  Some kind of cutout?
[03:22:56.010 --> 03:22:57.611]  Why don't you tell us who the cutout is?
[03:22:58.352 --> 03:22:59.793]  You can't because you don't know.
[03:22:59.853 --> 03:23:01.475]  Because there is no cutout.
[03:23:02.616 --> 03:23:05.359]  Assange is a freedom fighter.
[03:23:06.705 --> 03:23:07.626]  To me, he's a hero.
[03:23:08.546 --> 03:23:12.648]  I understand those on the left who say, well, he's broken the law.
[03:23:12.789 --> 03:23:14.670]  Well, they loved him, you know, eight years ago.
[03:23:14.770 --> 03:23:14.950]  Yeah.
[03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:16.170]  Well, he has broken the law.
[03:23:16.911 --> 03:23:22.374]  On the other hand, the law-breaking that he is exposing is so much bigger and more serious.
[03:23:22.974 --> 03:23:27.377]  Dr. Martin Luther King broke the law, too, because he was fighting for a larger goal.
[03:23:28.477 --> 03:23:29.158]  These laws
[03:23:30.365 --> 03:23:47.731]  Specifically are put in place to keep the people ignorant, to stop the exposure of the kind of internal corruption, and in some cases treason, that has been perpetrated by both the Obama and the Clinton administration.
[03:23:48.592 --> 03:23:50.372]  To me, Assange is a hero.
[03:23:50.833 --> 03:23:52.833]  He is not working for the Russians.
[03:23:53.053 --> 03:23:57.055]  He is working for no nation state, but he's against the deep state.
[03:23:57.608 --> 03:24:03.850]  Well, and let's be perfectly clear, the emails exposed by WikiLeaks have never been denied as being real.
[03:24:03.930 --> 03:24:06.451]  So the emails are real, the Democrats admit that they're real.
[03:24:06.531 --> 03:24:10.193]  So why aren't we discussing the content of the emails ever?
[03:24:10.633 --> 03:24:14.134]  Why are we constantly obsessing over claiming it's Russia without any proof?
[03:24:14.474 --> 03:24:16.915]  What do you think Mike Pompeo's next move is?
[03:24:16.975 --> 03:24:19.336]  Roger Stone, his piece is on Infowars.com right now.
[03:24:20.036 --> 03:24:24.318]  My guess is that he is going to resist.
[03:24:25.402 --> 03:24:31.773]  The president needs to order him to produce this, in my opinion, and I'm going to express that when I have the opportunity.
[03:24:33.772 --> 03:24:37.313]  The real question is, where does the whole Russian meme go?
[03:24:37.613 --> 03:24:45.556]  Because... It should have died when we're now looking at a new Cold War and perhaps World War III with Russia, but it didn't die there, did it?
[03:24:45.636 --> 03:24:47.777]  No, it's interesting.
[03:24:48.177 --> 03:24:51.378]  The incursion into Syria should have put the end to this.
[03:24:51.498 --> 03:24:55.139]  It should have taken the wind out of the sails of the whole argument.
[03:24:55.819 --> 03:24:57.540]  How can Donald Trump be in bed
[03:24:58.360 --> 03:25:02.461]  With Putin when he's kicking him in the ass in Syria.
[03:25:02.921 --> 03:25:24.586]  But, as I said, the reason I think the intelligence agencies and the military-industrial complex so desperately need to find some Russian link is if they fail to do so, they will be naked when the examination of Susan Rice and Valerie Jarrett and their use of intelligence data comes into focus.
[03:25:25.848 --> 03:25:27.468]  And that's jail time.
[03:25:27.748 --> 03:25:45.853]  In other words, if you look at Watergate as the only other previous national scandal we have had regarding, you know, surveillance and so on, while the Senate Watergate Committee hearings destabilized Nixon, while the House hearings on impeachment really signaled the end,
[03:25:46.673 --> 03:25:50.977]  It was the Watergate Special Prosecutor who really sent people to jail.
[03:25:51.838 --> 03:25:56.082]  Jeff Sessions needs to get more aggressive or the President needs to order him to do so.
[03:25:56.542 --> 03:25:58.244]  It's time to impanel a grand jury.
[03:25:58.704 --> 03:26:05.090]  It's time for the grand jury to question Susan Rice, Valerie Jarrett,
[03:26:06.425 --> 03:26:11.050]  But what I want to know, Owen, is what did the President know, and when did he know it?
[03:26:11.170 --> 03:26:13.373]  There is the real question for the grand jury.
[03:26:13.413 --> 03:26:20.701]  Well, and here's the reason why I think Obama is on a deserted island, is because of that, right there.
[03:26:20.721 --> 03:26:22.943]  The island with no extradition.
[03:26:23.124 --> 03:26:27.468]  I really believe that he is avoiding extradition, because here's the thing.
[03:26:28.536 --> 03:26:30.897]  I think that there's a major precedent that can be set here.
[03:26:30.917 --> 03:26:37.618]  There's a major example that can be set here with people like Susan Rice, people like Valerie Jarrett, who knows, maybe even Barack Obama.
[03:26:37.638 --> 03:26:40.238]  I mean, you know, let's not forget Trump called out his birth certificate.
[03:26:40.258 --> 03:26:43.299]  Yes, he retracted on that, but I think he was kind of forced to.
[03:26:43.879 --> 03:26:44.799]  They could set an example.
[03:26:44.839 --> 03:26:50.821]  Let's get these people in front of a jury and either force them to commit perjury or force them to admit what they did.
[03:26:51.181 --> 03:26:52.921]  That's what this country needs right now.
[03:26:52.961 --> 03:26:56.722]  The focus needs to be back on our swamp, not a swamp in North Korea.
[03:26:57.102 --> 03:26:58.143]  You want to take some calls, Roger?
[03:26:58.163 --> 03:26:59.143]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[03:26:59.163 --> 03:26:59.603]  Let's do it.
[03:26:59.683 --> 03:27:02.745]  Let's first go to James, who is in South Carolina.
[03:27:02.765 --> 03:27:04.906]  He wants to talk about Trump and Korea.
[03:27:04.946 --> 03:27:05.626]  Go ahead, James.
[03:27:09.729 --> 03:27:26.017]  The evolution of, if you might call it evolution, of the problem with North Korea stems from the fact that they have a terrible economy, and I don't believe they will ever get rid of the nuclear power
[03:27:32.098 --> 03:27:43.401]  Well, okay, so then the threat that America's interest is shutting down North Korea's nuclear capabilities, getting in there, disrupting Kim Jong-un from becoming nuclear capable, or putting a warhead at the end of a missile.
[03:27:44.001 --> 03:27:47.202]  I don't buy the economic thing because, please, let's look around the world.
[03:27:47.242 --> 03:27:51.484]  There are plenty of countries that are in economic poverty other than North Korea.
[03:27:51.504 --> 03:27:52.444]  Thank you for the call, James.
[03:27:52.504 --> 03:27:52.724]  Roger?
[03:27:53.919 --> 03:27:56.021]  You know, I'm a non-interventionist.
[03:27:56.081 --> 03:27:58.564]  I think Donald Trump is a non-interventionist.
[03:27:59.325 --> 03:28:03.028]  There are times, however, when American power must be projected.
[03:28:03.129 --> 03:28:10.216]  There are times when international foes really do pose a fundamental danger to the United States.
[03:28:10.316 --> 03:28:12.979]  North Korea is such a place.
[03:28:14.446 --> 03:28:28.881]  Very clearly based on what recently happened in Syria, what has recently happened in Afghanistan, no longer do we have an American president who will draw a line in the sand and then sit back helplessly while our adversaries cross it.
[03:28:29.862 --> 03:28:34.324]  And this is not the Obama administration anymore.
[03:28:34.744 --> 03:28:38.906]  And the coddling of the North Korean dictator is over.
[03:28:39.646 --> 03:28:45.908]  Donald Trump will do what is necessary to ensure that he doesn't have deliverable nuclear weapons.
[03:28:46.569 --> 03:28:48.089]  Thank God for that.
[03:28:48.469 --> 03:28:55.132]  Sadly, there are still places where we do need to project American power to protect our self-interest.
[03:28:55.792 --> 03:28:57.253]  North Korea, to me, is one of them.
[03:28:57.918 --> 03:28:58.919]  Let's go to another caller.
[03:28:58.959 --> 03:29:02.020]  Let's go to Jason, who's calling in from Germany.
[03:29:02.160 --> 03:29:03.041]  Go ahead, Jason.
[03:29:04.201 --> 03:29:09.925]  Hey, it's a pleasure to be on with you, Owen, and Mr. Stone, truly a pleasure for the first time to be able to talk with you, sir.
[03:29:10.505 --> 03:29:11.145]  Thank you.
[03:29:11.886 --> 03:29:15.948]  Gosh, I wish I could rap with you guys about these things for all night, practically.
[03:29:18.709 --> 03:29:26.520]  You were on Bill Maher's show recently, you guys talked about the 420 thing, about cannabis legalization and state's rights issues and whatnot.
[03:29:26.540 --> 03:29:32.127]  There's a really good article, I forget the online magazine, it's called...
[03:29:33.115 --> 03:29:53.502]  Cannabis or marijuana legislation where federalism goes to die basically outlines, you know, how Nobody who claims that they're in for states rights can honestly admit that by maintaining, you know, the status quo Schedule a federal schedule of drugs that they use for cannabis Can can maintain that and say that they're for states rights.
[03:29:53.522 --> 03:29:54.722]  That's that's one one point.
[03:29:54.742 --> 03:29:56.543]  I wanted to drop real quick but um
[03:29:57.489 --> 03:30:06.539]  As far as delivering on domestic issues, which Alex loves to bring up, and I don't want to hate on Alex, I love Alex, I love your show, I love everybody that works there, but here's the thing.
[03:30:08.041 --> 03:30:11.144]  The elite know that there's many ways you can skin a cat.
[03:30:11.885 --> 03:30:17.832]  And I feel like Trump could conceivably deliver on all the domestic issues he wanted, all the ones that he promised.
[03:30:18.989 --> 03:30:27.376]  And it wouldn't hurt the bottom line of the people behind the curtain, as it were, that are really pulling the strings around the world.
[03:30:27.416 --> 03:30:30.839]  It wouldn't hurt them at all for Trump to deliver on all those domestic issues.
[03:30:31.199 --> 03:30:39.686]  And they could still kind of weasel their way into the affairs of America in such a way that they still get the end product that they really want anyway.
[03:30:39.806 --> 03:30:45.411]  Or still persuade Trump into using United States foreign policy to get their agenda across the globe.
[03:30:45.431 --> 03:30:46.152]  I hear what you're saying.
[03:30:46.192 --> 03:30:46.412]  Roger?
[03:30:47.495 --> 03:30:50.259]  I don't think anybody thought this was going to be easy.
[03:30:50.340 --> 03:30:56.509]  We're trying to undo 30 years of bad decisions that were, in many cases, purposely made.
[03:30:57.491 --> 03:31:02.319]  And there is an entrenched opposition in Washington, in the Democratic Party, in the media.
[03:31:03.279 --> 03:31:06.382]  That is, barely recognizes the president's election.
[03:31:06.402 --> 03:31:23.933]  So you're right, except for to say that if he enacts his domestic agenda, he will strengthen his governing coalition, and therefore he would have greater strength to take on the international globalists and the two-party duopoly in Washington.
[03:31:24.934 --> 03:31:28.596]  And he is, at base, a fighter.
[03:31:29.517 --> 03:31:30.878]  He's also realistic.
[03:31:30.938 --> 03:31:31.979]  He's absolutely right.
[03:31:32.159 --> 03:31:40.626]  I wouldn't engage the Chinese on trade or currency manipulation at the exact moment that we need their assistance to disarm the North Koreans.
[03:31:40.646 --> 03:31:41.827]  You gotta have priorities.
[03:31:42.607 --> 03:31:49.453]  If we are incinerated by a thermonuclear weapon, it won't matter what our trade policies have been.
[03:31:50.013 --> 03:31:52.655]  So, the President understands priorities.
[03:31:53.755 --> 03:31:56.097]  Don't underestimate him, that's all I can say.
[03:31:56.117 --> 03:32:00.220]  He's going to get his domestic agenda done.
[03:32:00.260 --> 03:32:07.065]  We've already seated the first of what I think could be four conservative Supreme Court justices.
[03:32:07.645 --> 03:32:13.950]  You can make no more fundamental change in the country than that.
[03:32:15.031 --> 03:32:17.353]  Yes, there is a difficult struggle ahead.
[03:32:17.873 --> 03:32:23.840]  Well, and I think if you look at it from the standpoint as he's building a campaign up for 2020, it's working very well.
[03:32:23.980 --> 03:32:26.223]  Building up domestic policy is going to help.
[03:32:26.843 --> 03:32:32.229]  And even though a lot of the InfoWars fans or InfoWars base may be divided on Trump right now and his foreign policy,
[03:32:33.370 --> 03:32:44.280]  The Fox News base out there, those type of people, the drive-by media viewers, they love everything he's doing, and I think that he's really building a nice case for 2020 right now, and he's trying to win that, I think.
[03:32:44.340 --> 03:32:45.361]  Let's take one more call.
[03:32:45.821 --> 03:32:47.943]  Let's go to Greg in Oregon.
[03:32:48.103 --> 03:32:48.864]  Go ahead, Greg.
[03:32:48.884 --> 03:32:50.265]  You're on air with Roger Stone.
[03:32:50.285 --> 03:32:51.946]  Hi, Owen.
[03:32:51.986 --> 03:32:52.627]  Hi, Roger.
[03:32:52.767 --> 03:32:54.548]  It's a pleasure to be on with you guys.
[03:32:55.669 --> 03:32:56.330]  Go ahead, Greg.
[03:32:56.350 --> 03:32:56.690]  Thank you.
[03:32:57.491 --> 03:33:00.593]  Yeah, I hope that Trump lets
[03:33:02.588 --> 03:33:02.748]  I agree.
[03:33:02.808 --> 03:33:04.230]  I think we need to get out of all these wars.
[03:33:04.250 --> 03:33:08.894]  Our country is in serious bad trouble and Trump needs to drain the swamp in the White House.
[03:33:23.072 --> 03:33:28.477]  I believe he's already been compromised and they're taking over and forcing him to do things.
[03:33:28.517 --> 03:33:33.682]  He's let his generals run the military right now and he doesn't have any say in it.
[03:33:35.124 --> 03:33:46.154]  I believe that he's already been compromised ever since that CIA put that picture of the grandbaby in the bedroom, sent that picture out, he has changed.
[03:33:46.638 --> 03:33:48.619]  Well, I think the caller, Greg, you're half right.
[03:33:48.639 --> 03:33:55.102]  There definitely is an effort to make him a puppet, but I don't think they understand the man.
[03:33:55.122 --> 03:33:55.822]  Perfect example.
[03:34:16.363 --> 03:34:18.204]  We made the limited strike into Syria.
[03:34:19.185 --> 03:34:21.246]  The generals now come in for the kill.
[03:34:21.287 --> 03:34:24.349]  We need 150,000 boots on the ground immediately.
[03:34:24.449 --> 03:34:25.850]  We need to ramp up these attacks.
[03:34:26.850 --> 03:34:36.878]  Trump, just based on his own instinct, with no one on the White House staff, sadly not even our friend Steve Bannon, urging him not to go into Syria.
[03:34:39.272 --> 03:34:41.474]  Moves immediately and comes to the right place.
[03:34:41.574 --> 03:34:43.156]  No, we're not having an expanded war.
[03:34:43.196 --> 03:34:45.739]  This is not going to be the next Vietnam, the next Iraq.
[03:34:45.939 --> 03:34:48.762]  So, my trust is in Donald Trump.
[03:34:48.802 --> 03:34:51.204]  Yeah, they are trying to undercut him.
[03:34:51.605 --> 03:34:52.966]  They're trying to flip him.
[03:34:53.387 --> 03:34:54.368]  They will not succeed.
[03:35:01.883 --> 03:35:10.429]  On Sunday, Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones broke the news that Google contractors are being directed to rate InfoWars articles to push them even further down in search engine results.
[03:35:10.750 --> 03:35:13.391]  And liberals came out of the woodwork to say we were lying.
[03:35:13.692 --> 03:35:15.173]  Well now we have Business Insider.
[03:35:15.333 --> 03:35:21.677]  Google says rogue vendor violated guidelines by instructing contractors to rate InfoWars as untrustworthy site.
[03:35:21.877 --> 03:35:28.342]  Google said that the vendor had mistakenly told staffers working for the search engine that InfoWars should be ranked as a low-quality site.
[03:35:28.502 --> 03:35:28.802]  Oh yeah.
[03:35:29.042 --> 03:35:29.943]  We believe you, Google.
[03:35:30.143 --> 03:35:30.764]  We believe you.
[03:35:30.944 --> 03:35:39.191]  Google reps are attempting to distance themselves from the contractor's instructions by saying it does not instruct quality raters on how to grade specific websites.
[03:35:39.391 --> 03:35:42.053]  Let's read what the contractor said in their bonus example.
[03:35:42.273 --> 03:35:46.937]  While CNN isn't a perfect news outlet, it is a popular news source that covers stories with depth to compare.
[03:35:47.118 --> 03:35:50.901]  The InfoWars article is brief and only mentions statements from sources not typical.
[03:35:51.201 --> 03:35:57.783]  Of course, they're talking about the recent Syrian chemical attack that we're saying is a false flag and is now being proven in spades.
[03:35:58.023 --> 03:36:01.084]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:36:02.864 --> 03:36:08.186]  The reason InfoWars Live has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:36:08.346 --> 03:36:14.568]  I take this, my family takes this, and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:36:14.608 --> 03:36:19.049]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:36:19.209 --> 03:36:23.772]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:36:23.852 --> 03:36:24.892]  I don't feel good.
[03:36:24.972 --> 03:36:28.494]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:36:28.735 --> 03:36:31.376]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:36:31.436 --> 03:36:36.739]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:36:37.220 --> 03:36:39.621]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:36:40.201 --> 03:36:43.603]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:36:43.723 --> 03:36:45.905]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:36:45.965 --> 03:36:46.325]  I love it.
[03:36:46.485 --> 03:36:49.087]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:36:49.287 --> 03:36:50.248]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:36:50.288 --> 03:36:55.933]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:36:56.113 --> 03:36:57.875]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:36:58.135 --> 03:37:00.157]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[03:37:05.956 --> 03:37:07.457]  There is a crisis in America today.
[03:37:07.918 --> 03:37:10.320]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[03:37:10.620 --> 03:37:18.026]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[03:37:18.426 --> 03:37:22.049]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[03:37:22.369 --> 03:37:23.530]  I have the answer for you today.
[03:37:23.931 --> 03:37:25.092]  It's called the Blocky Pocket.
[03:37:25.834 --> 03:37:28.817]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone and it's safe.
[03:37:29.437 --> 03:37:31.139]  No radiation compartment.
[03:37:31.579 --> 03:37:37.345]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[03:37:38.165 --> 03:37:40.628]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[03:37:40.828 --> 03:37:46.793]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[03:37:47.554 --> 03:37:49.235]  With the Block-It Pocket, this is impossible.
[03:37:49.696 --> 03:37:52.397]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[03:37:52.698 --> 03:37:57.241]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own Block-It Pocket.
[03:38:21.261 --> 03:38:30.830]  All right, I've got... Is this the... Are you on the cover?
[03:38:31.050 --> 03:38:31.371]  I don't know.
[03:38:31.391 --> 03:38:32.732]  We were just handed this.
[03:38:32.872 --> 03:38:37.357]  Roger Stone, New York Times best-selling author, The Making of the President 2016.
[03:38:37.397 --> 03:38:40.440]  You can find it at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:38:40.520 --> 03:38:42.262]  Roger, it looks like you've got some good reviews here.
[03:38:43.462 --> 03:38:44.543]  Yeah, it's coming up.
[03:38:44.803 --> 03:38:48.485]  We've got a book event here tonight in Austin.
[03:38:49.346 --> 03:38:54.369]  We have an event on the 20th in Round Rock, Texas at the Barnes & Noble.
[03:38:54.469 --> 03:38:59.012]  So we're doing our Texas Swing and it's exciting.
[03:38:59.433 --> 03:39:00.173]  It's great to
[03:39:01.374 --> 03:39:03.676]  To meet the patriots, to meet the freedom fighters.
[03:39:04.056 --> 03:39:12.143]  I came here from New York, and as I indicated to you, the level of vitriol, the hatred on the streets is just extraordinary.
[03:39:12.183 --> 03:39:13.204]  People snare at you.
[03:39:13.705 --> 03:39:17.948]  Some old man with a cane was shaking his cane at me.
[03:39:17.989 --> 03:39:20.631]  And women have spit on me.
[03:39:20.651 --> 03:39:22.132]  These people are ridiculous.
[03:39:22.172 --> 03:39:23.293]  Liberals, they're so tolerant.
[03:39:23.333 --> 03:39:24.814]  They love free speech.
[03:39:25.595 --> 03:39:26.696]  As long as it's theirs.
[03:39:27.116 --> 03:39:35.743]  It really is shocking, though, when you actually confront, when you have a face-to-face confrontation with a liberal and you're like, whoa, you actually really believe what you just said, don't you?
[03:39:36.424 --> 03:39:36.684]  Wow.
[03:39:37.204 --> 03:39:38.465]  Yeah, it is.
[03:39:38.786 --> 03:39:47.232]  And for people who preach tolerance, the seething hatred is really extraordinary.
[03:39:47.392 --> 03:39:49.154]  And frankly, it grows tedious.
[03:39:49.454 --> 03:39:55.239]  So hey, come out, get your The Making of the President 2016 book by Roger Stone signed.
[03:39:55.359 --> 03:40:01.885]  He is doing the Austin, Texas tour right now, so be sure to check it out and get your book at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:40:01.905 --> 03:40:09.573]  Let's try to squeeze in a couple more calls here before we sign off for the Alex Jones Show and then pick it back up with the InfoWars Live 3 to 5.
[03:40:09.853 --> 03:40:12.615]  Let's go to Nate in Guam who wants to talk Trump and North Korea.
[03:40:12.635 --> 03:40:13.156]  Go ahead, Nate.
[03:40:14.815 --> 03:40:15.455]  Hey, Owen.
[03:40:15.896 --> 03:40:16.196]  Hey.
[03:40:16.756 --> 03:40:17.537]  First time caller.
[03:40:18.397 --> 03:40:19.358]  You know what?
[03:40:19.418 --> 03:40:21.279]  Calling from Guam.
[03:40:21.779 --> 03:40:24.360]  I want to say a big shout out to Hank Johnson there, buddy.
[03:40:24.861 --> 03:40:26.061]  We got enough people over here.
[03:40:26.141 --> 03:40:29.643]  We're still not tipped over, so might as well go back to school for that one.
[03:40:29.663 --> 03:40:32.165]  Mr. Stone, I absolutely love you, sir.
[03:40:32.225 --> 03:40:33.145]  You are a patriot.
[03:40:33.225 --> 03:40:34.086]  God help you.
[03:40:34.166 --> 03:40:35.346]  God bless your family.
[03:40:35.386 --> 03:40:36.147]  God bless yourself.
[03:40:36.964 --> 03:40:40.887]  Um, the entire InfoWars team, I want to make this quick because I know you guys had to get to the other callers.
[03:40:41.468 --> 03:40:46.511]  Everyone that's listening out there, my brother and I, Alan, want to say this to you because he is the one that red-pilled me.
[03:40:46.531 --> 03:41:00.322]  I want to tell you, you know what, right now, take advantage of these sales that they've got because every single product that they have, I bought two Lexapur water filters, have the supplements coming, taking them, and they work great.
[03:41:01.275 --> 03:41:02.695]  A couple things here.
[03:41:03.195 --> 03:41:12.277]  You know, Owen, you mentioned earlier about how the Infowars populace out there were getting divided and stuff like that.
[03:41:13.078 --> 03:41:14.938]  There's a lot of stuff that I've been disappointed with.
[03:41:15.078 --> 03:41:17.839]  I voted for Trump, got the shirt, Trump's my president.
[03:41:19.339 --> 03:41:22.400]  I actually live out in California, but I'm visiting family in Guam.
[03:41:23.300 --> 03:41:28.901]  And it's so sad that with free speech we can't even wear that shirt without running the risk of getting eaten up.
[03:41:29.397 --> 03:41:30.598]  Well that's what Roger was talking about.
[03:41:30.618 --> 03:41:31.659]  It's the tolerant left.
[03:41:32.219 --> 03:41:36.723]  You know, I mean, you don't... Everybody has a right to free speech until the liberals disagree with you.
[03:41:37.163 --> 03:41:38.884]  And you know, I wouldn't be surprised, Roger.
[03:41:38.924 --> 03:41:41.266]  I mean, you've got some book signings coming up here in Austin.
[03:41:41.606 --> 03:41:45.830]  I mean, you know the liberals here in Austin like to show up and be loud and obnoxious.
[03:41:45.870 --> 03:41:48.211]  I mean, you might see a few more canes getting whacked.
[03:41:48.231 --> 03:41:53.996]  You know, as you know, I'm a little combative myself, so... I told you, you need to stop that.
[03:41:54.036 --> 03:41:56.438]  You need to lay off the super male vitality you're trying to fight to.
[03:41:57.138 --> 03:42:03.360]  That does, and we're going to be producing the new Donald Trump 2020 baseball bat soon, so.
[03:42:03.540 --> 03:42:05.840]  No, look, liberals are happy to come.
[03:42:05.860 --> 03:42:07.441]  Can you sign that for me at your book signing?
[03:42:07.521 --> 03:42:11.102]  Liberals are welcome to come and ask any stupid question they want.
[03:42:11.202 --> 03:42:17.443]  Just don't get in the way of the people who are there for legitimate purposes and just want to learn and enjoy.
[03:42:18.044 --> 03:42:23.005]  So, we're at Big Daddy's tonight in Houston.
[03:42:23.765 --> 03:42:24.565]  Pardon me, in Austin.
[03:42:24.925 --> 03:42:28.806]  A burger joint where we're gonna have, I think, a good mix of people.
[03:42:28.846 --> 03:42:29.487]  So come on by.
[03:42:29.807 --> 03:42:31.587]  Please don't provoke Roger, okay?
[03:42:31.607 --> 03:42:33.047]  He's not the one you want to provoke.
[03:42:33.087 --> 03:42:34.588]  Thank you guys so much for tuning in.
[03:42:34.628 --> 03:42:35.548]  Thank you, Roger Stone.
[03:42:35.908 --> 03:42:37.048]  Alex Jones Show will be back.
[03:42:37.208 --> 03:42:38.249]  InfoWars Live 3 to 5.
[03:42:38.609 --> 03:42:41.169]  I'm switching over to the other studio right now.
[03:42:41.289 --> 03:42:43.710]  More news to cover and we'll probably take your calls as well.
[03:42:43.750 --> 03:42:45.110]  I'll be joined by Millie Weaver.
[03:42:45.150 --> 03:42:47.351]  Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:42:51.818 --> 03:42:58.142]  According to the mainstream media, President Donald Trump was mean to kids on Easter Sunday.
[03:42:58.343 --> 03:43:12.712]  That's right, dozens of news outlets ran with a misleading video that was spread by Politico yesterday, claiming that President Trump signed a Kids Make America Great Again hat and then threw it away from the kid into the crowd.
[03:43:12.973 --> 03:43:19.277]  The video quickly went viral, racking up nearly 10,000 retweets and getting picked up by other news outlets.
[03:43:19.677 --> 03:43:31.695]  The Washington Post reported Trump, using a thick sharpie, put his signature on the bill of the cap, then looked up and lobbed it into the crowd, nowhere near the hand that had given it to him.
[03:43:32.256 --> 03:43:35.181]  BuzzFeed even claimed that the poor kid never got his hat back.
[03:43:35.481 --> 03:43:41.505]  But in reality, other camera angles clearly show the president and the kid were just having fun.
[03:43:41.665 --> 03:43:46.468]  And the boy indeed caught his hat signed by the President of the United States.
[03:43:46.988 --> 03:43:51.211]  You can see the videos for yourself right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:43:52.811 --> 03:43:58.635]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
