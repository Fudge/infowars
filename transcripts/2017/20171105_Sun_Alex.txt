[00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:14.706]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.504]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:25.924 --> 00:00:28.265]  This Sunday, November 5th, 2017.
[00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:31.446]  I am filling in for Alex temporarily here.
[00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:33.246]  I will be your host for the first hour.
[00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:34.287]  Owen Schroer with you.
[00:00:35.027 --> 00:00:38.068]  We will be hearing from Alex in the second hour.
[00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:52.873]  As well as our reporter, actually our news director, and sometimes reporter Rob Dew, will be boots on the ground at the scene of the fatal shooting at the church in Texas here today.
[00:00:53.013 --> 00:00:56.935]  Obviously that will be the focal point of today's broadcast.
[00:00:56.955 --> 00:01:03.157]  We do have some other news we may get to, but let's just get you up to speed in case you are not aware.
[00:01:03.837 --> 00:01:07.960]  At least 20 people killed in a church shooting today in Texas.
[00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:10.983]  It happened just after 11 a.m.
[00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:14.626]  Central Time today, as the congregation was gathering.
[00:01:16.027 --> 00:01:19.109]  I'm hearing reports of 27 dead, but there are conflicting reports.
[00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.790]  These numbers do tend to change.
[00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:25.014]  At least 30 injured, so we'll keep you posted as we get those numbers in.
[00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:30.038]  I'm not sure how they can have those official numbers yet, so we'll continue to monitor that.
[00:01:32.247 --> 00:01:50.130]  The pastor, the normal pastor of the church, this Baptist church, was not actually there today, and his daughter was though, and his daughter is one of the deceased, including young children are among the deceased as well.
[00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.431]  Again, a church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
[00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:57.832]  There is Pastor Frank Pomeroy, who is
[00:01:58.914 --> 00:02:26.825]  normally the one delivering the sermon and leading the congregation but was out today so he was not amongst the congregation today however his daughter was unfortunately is among the deceased as well as at least twenty others now the FBI has taken over the investigation so not sure
[00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.915]  What that exactly means as far as what we're going to be told or how the investigation will be handled.
[00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:37.797]  So we'll continue to keep tabs on that as well.
[00:02:39.018 --> 00:02:46.964]  There are some interesting things and even though we have to sit here and get through the grief and the realization that many people died today.
[00:02:48.705 --> 00:02:54.309]  But we do have to report on some things about it that you just don't even have to think about.
[00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.111]  But these are the things that we do here at InfoWars.
[00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:01.686]  Couple of strange things, obviously, you know, the pastor not in today.
[00:03:02.646 --> 00:03:07.349]  He has not, I've not heard a statement yet from him, not seen him on any of the television interviews.
[00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.791]  We've seen a lot of other people, eyewitnesses, etc.
[00:03:11.872 --> 00:03:16.114]  The story is, we don't have any information on the shooter either.
[00:03:16.594 --> 00:03:19.156]  They're just saying, lone gunman, over and over again.
[00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:25.740]  Apparently, the story is, he goes into the church, unloads,
[00:03:27.093 --> 00:03:39.365]  They keep saying, I keep hearing semi-automatic rifles, but again we've got no details about the actual firearms that were used or any details as far as caliber or what type of weapon.
[00:03:40.306 --> 00:03:44.330]  They do say that the shooter paused to reload
[00:03:46.761 --> 00:04:02.687]  So we're hearing semi-automatic weapon, pause to reload at least once, and they're saying that he pretty much hit, or I guess we don't know if it's a he or she, but saying that the shooter pretty much hit everyone in the congregation.
[00:04:02.747 --> 00:04:11.150]  Now Sutherland Springs is a town of about 500 people, so most likely this is one of those small towns where everybody knows everybody.
[00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:30.203]  All will be impacted by this, but apparently the shooter goes into the church, unloads a couple magazines, and then is able to get away from the scene, flee the scene, and drive his car away, and then apparently somehow was apprehended five blocks down the road.
[00:04:32.204 --> 00:04:34.885]  And he is now, or the shooter is now deceased.
[00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:45.326]  One interesting angle that we're looking at right now is the fact that this church records all of its Sunday congregations.
[00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:47.448]  Every single one of them can be found on YouTube.
[00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:53.413]  So one can only assume that the camera was rolling when this shooting happened.
[00:04:53.973 --> 00:04:54.774]  Is that the case?
[00:04:55.014 --> 00:04:56.255]  Will we ever see this footage?
[00:04:56.976 --> 00:04:58.197]  What is the FBI up to?
[00:04:58.217 --> 00:04:59.818]  We'll have more of it on the other side.
[00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:00.559]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:05:03.393 --> 00:05:23.461]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:25.302]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[00:06:15.444 --> 00:06:19.266]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:19.706 --> 00:06:21.247]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.871]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:28.891 --> 00:06:30.892]  It is Sunday, November 5th, 2017.
[00:06:31.313 --> 00:06:34.895]  Filling in for Alex today, I'm Owen Schroer.
[00:06:34.995 --> 00:06:38.336]  We will be hearing from Alex in the second hour, however.
[00:06:38.517 --> 00:06:44.260]  Alex did file some reports that are going to be key that we will be hearing in the second hour.
[00:06:45.273 --> 00:06:46.594]  I'll be with you for the first hour.
[00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:53.937]  We'll be keeping you updated on everything that is happening in Sutherland Springs right now where there was a mass shooting.
[00:06:54.537 --> 00:06:59.240]  At least 20 people dead inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.641]  In the last segment I said that
[00:07:02.401 --> 00:07:03.602]  I wasn't sure if it was he or she.
[00:07:03.622 --> 00:07:05.383]  They have confirmed the shooter was male.
[00:07:06.003 --> 00:07:22.875]  It's funny that we don't get any other details of the shooter that's already been reported as deceased, was somehow able to flee the scene, flee the church, after killing at least 20 people and shooting at least 50 people, and it's been reported that he pretty much shot everyone in the congregation that day.
[00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:28.979]  Pastor Pomeroy, who normally delivers the sermon and leads the congregation on Sundays, was not there this Sunday.
[00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:31.881]  His daughter, unfortunately, was among the deceased.
[00:07:32.782 --> 00:07:36.954]  This is a church that records all of their Sunday congregations.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:44.325]  So one must wonder, was the camera rolling when the shooting happened?
[00:07:44.405 --> 00:07:49.069]  Here is their YouTube channel, First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas.
[00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.492]  Was the camera recording while the shooting happened?
[00:07:53.033 --> 00:07:55.014]  Is there any footage of this shooting?
[00:07:55.375 --> 00:08:02.081]  Did the FBI confiscate what could have been possible evidence that will no longer ever be available to the public?
[00:08:03.587 --> 00:08:04.668]  Interesting angles there.
[00:08:04.708 --> 00:08:16.154]  We've got some other angles that we're keeping our feelers on right now, but considering the seriousness of this event and trying to be as accurate as possible, we're going to wait and flesh all of this out as details emerge.
[00:08:16.615 --> 00:08:23.138]  We are currently waiting on a press conference that is set to begin here, I would guess, within the next 20 minutes.
[00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:29.374]  This is from, I believe, the Sutherland Springs Police Station.
[00:08:29.955 --> 00:08:31.196]  I'm not sure about that, though.
[00:08:31.216 --> 00:08:34.918]  Taking a second look with the piano there, I'm wondering if this might be just a local school.
[00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:46.186]  Regardless, though, there will be a press conference soon, and we will carry that live, so stick with us if you want to hear from the official press conference.
[00:08:46.286 --> 00:08:50.309]  I wonder if we'll be hearing from the FBI, if we'll be hearing from the local police department.
[00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:59.999]  Or if we'll be seeing what we've seen in the past, the local police department with an FBI agent gleaming, glaring, standing over his shoulder.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.901]  So we'll keep you posted.
[00:09:03.742 --> 00:09:05.845]  We'll just run down some of the headlines here.
[00:09:07.185 --> 00:09:10.446]  At least 27 people killed at a Texas church.
[00:09:10.546 --> 00:09:12.466]  Multiple people injured, including a two-year-old.
[00:09:12.546 --> 00:09:19.728]  So again, the numbers have reached as high as 27, as well as 30 injured in Sutherland Springs church shooting.
[00:09:20.808 --> 00:09:30.891]  Trump has tweeted out, as well as Vice President Mike Pence, obviously condolences and feelings and prayers with the people of Sutherland Springs.
[00:09:34.212 --> 00:09:35.132]  Let's go right into this.
[00:09:36.869 --> 00:09:38.030]  This is coming from the Hill.
[00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:42.333]  Dems renew calls for gun legislation in wake of Texas church shooting.
[00:09:43.914 --> 00:09:50.878]  This is actually, this is beyond politics to me, to be quite honest with you.
[00:09:50.898 --> 00:10:06.529]  Because what we can report here, which is what typically happens, that the Democrats immediately politicize these things, they immediately blame the guns, blame the truck, don't blame the guy driving the truck, blame the gun, not the guy that pulled the trigger.
[00:10:10.572 --> 00:10:11.453]  But think about this.
[00:10:13.715 --> 00:10:18.599]  I'm not even going to complain about the Dems politicizing this, because we already knew that that was coming.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.421]  Of course they want to grab the guns.
[00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:20.902]  Really?
[00:10:21.122 --> 00:10:21.502]  Shocking.
[00:10:22.283 --> 00:10:27.327]  But this is what is sick about this to me, and what the bigger issue here is.
[00:10:28.849 --> 00:10:35.935]  Folks, think of how many lives could have been saved today if one person in that congregation was caring.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.441]  If one person had his concealed carry permit and had a pistol on his hip today.
[00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:43.501]  What about two people?
[00:10:43.541 --> 00:10:57.544]  What if there were three, four people, four good Americans, members of the congregation, carrying their firearms with their concealed carry, which you have to have training to get, you have to know how to shoot a pistol at short range.
[00:10:59.345 --> 00:11:04.946]  Imagine if you had just one though, just one, just one American citizen in that church
[00:11:06.038 --> 00:11:07.259]  That had his concealed carry.
[00:11:07.819 --> 00:11:09.401]  How many lives could have been saved today?
[00:11:12.003 --> 00:11:16.366]  So do the Democrats really not have this common sense?
[00:11:17.087 --> 00:11:18.028]  Wow, here's another one.
[00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:24.573]  Oh my gosh, this story was just published by Mallory Shelbourne on the Hill.
[00:11:25.214 --> 00:11:29.197]  House Democrats slam NRA in wake of Texas shooting.
[00:11:31.038 --> 00:11:32.820]  Now, again folks, like I said,
[00:11:34.645 --> 00:11:37.069]  This just shows the Democrats' true colors.
[00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:41.395]  When we say that they want the guns, they want the guns!
[00:11:42.096 --> 00:11:43.137]  Here's Kamala Harris.
[00:11:43.758 --> 00:11:47.724]  Kamala Harris condemns senseless gun violence after Texas church shooting.
[00:11:51.291 --> 00:11:52.372]  So this is what we're saying.
[00:11:53.072 --> 00:11:54.754]  They really do want your guns, folks.
[00:11:54.774 --> 00:11:56.836]  They really want to come for your guns.
[00:11:57.416 --> 00:12:04.802]  Totalitarians, authoritarians, communists have to take your guns.
[00:12:04.862 --> 00:12:08.425]  You see, you can't have a weapon.
[00:12:08.445 --> 00:12:11.808]  You can't have a firearm and be a slave.
[00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:18.113]  You can't be under thumb of a big government
[00:12:19.636 --> 00:12:20.316]  When you're armed.
[00:12:20.696 --> 00:12:21.837]  That's the entire point.
[00:12:23.757 --> 00:12:36.100]  So when we go out to, you look at yesterday's protest in Austin, and you've got hundreds of Americans out there, open carrying, executing their Second Amendment right.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.641]  By the way, don't tell Don Lemon or Jake Tapper, but guess what?
[00:12:39.901 --> 00:12:40.821]  No one got shot.
[00:12:42.141 --> 00:12:42.421]  Wow.
[00:12:43.602 --> 00:12:44.302]  Imagine that.
[00:12:46.693 --> 00:12:51.936]  Hundreds of people on the streets of Austin yesterday with all kinds of different firearms.
[00:12:52.957 --> 00:12:53.417]  Zero.
[00:12:55.298 --> 00:12:56.439]  Zero people got shot.
[00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:58.760]  Zero times with a firearm discharged.
[00:13:00.381 --> 00:13:06.685]  And here are the Democrats the next day blaming guns for what happened at the church.
[00:13:10.007 --> 00:13:12.709]  So, this shows their true colors.
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.942]  That they really want to come for the guns.
[00:13:19.442 --> 00:13:28.166]  And that's the first thing they think of when an event like this happens is, ooh, how can we virtue signal and grab the guns?
[00:13:29.687 --> 00:13:30.327]  That's what they do.
[00:13:33.048 --> 00:13:40.752]  And it really just shows their mental makeup that instead of the, it just, their
[00:13:42.295 --> 00:14:02.820]  Their agenda to grab the guns, their agenda to target the Second Amendment, their agenda to blame guns, their agenda to blame the gun owners of America, their agenda to blame the NRA, their agenda to demonize anyone that has a firearm, their agenda to demonize, blame, with any angle, guns and gun owners.
[00:14:03.965 --> 00:14:15.650]  Is at the top of their priority so that it supersedes common sense, which is if there was one good citizen there with a gun, multiple lives could have been saved.
[00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.991]  So what does that tell you about people like Kamala Harris?
[00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:31.856]  That common sense, decency, and the Constitution are all put on the back burner
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:38.923]  For the agenda, to grab the guns, demonize the Second Amendment, and demonize gun owners.
[00:14:39.343 --> 00:14:41.084]  There's a tweet from Kamala Harris, folks.
[00:14:41.785 --> 00:14:47.608]  This is approximately two hours after the shooting happened.
[00:14:48.288 --> 00:14:53.071]  Kamala Harris tweets out, Senseless gun violence has torn apart another community.
[00:14:53.731 --> 00:14:55.112]  This time in a house of worship.
[00:14:55.392 --> 00:14:56.953]  When do we say enough is enough?
[00:14:58.979 --> 00:15:00.600]  I think it's enough of Kamala Harris.
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:01.620]  That's what I think.
[00:15:02.081 --> 00:15:02.921]  It's enough of you.
[00:15:03.421 --> 00:15:06.363]  And it's enough of you demonizing guns.
[00:15:06.683 --> 00:15:07.844]  And here's another thing, folks.
[00:15:09.485 --> 00:15:13.767]  Yesterday, after the march was over,
[00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.391]  There were a lot of patriots.
[00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:23.457]  Honestly, I want to thank all the patriots out there because I know that a lot of you have my back when I'm out there and you're watching out for us.
[00:15:24.498 --> 00:15:32.485]  And some of them were kind of following me after the deal as I was searching for some of these protesters to get an interview with them that were protected by the police.
[00:15:33.502 --> 00:15:44.111]  And so we're walking up the block and a couple girls walk out, four girls walk out of the coffee shop and they literally shrieked when they saw a gun.
[00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:48.034]  They literally shrieked in horror and ran across the street.
[00:15:48.674 --> 00:15:49.615]  I'm not kidding you.
[00:15:49.875 --> 00:15:51.176]  They didn't even look both ways.
[00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:52.317]  They could have been hit by a car.
[00:15:52.577 --> 00:16:01.705]  But the sight of a gun scared them so much that they had to flee the scene even though if there was a man with a gun, lives could have been saved today.
[00:16:02.602 --> 00:16:06.923]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:12.425]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[00:16:12.965 --> 00:16:16.886]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[00:16:16.926 --> 00:16:20.247]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[00:16:20.887 --> 00:16:25.348]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[00:16:25.988 --> 00:16:29.249]  It's you the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[00:16:29.929 --> 00:16:31.470]  I came in here an hour ago.
[00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:39.452]  And I literally just went to Infowarsstore.com and printed the 5-star reviews, the first few pages.
[00:16:39.752 --> 00:16:43.554]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[00:16:44.154 --> 00:16:47.615]  And it's 5-star after 5-star after 5-star.
[00:16:47.995 --> 00:16:49.675]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[00:16:50.136 --> 00:16:56.458]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at Infowarslife.com.
[00:16:56.498 --> 00:16:57.398]  Let's go over them right now.
[00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:59.459]  This is verified by our Mark.
[00:16:59.659 --> 00:17:02.600]  Five-star review for AnthroPlex for men and women.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.120]  I take it as directed.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:15.024]  As one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[00:17:15.584 --> 00:17:16.265]  Easy does it.
[00:17:16.365 --> 00:17:17.365]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[00:17:17.385 --> 00:17:18.345]  It's very, very serious.
[00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:19.166]  Not a game.
[00:17:19.186 --> 00:17:19.606]  Thank you, Mark.
[00:17:20.106 --> 00:17:21.407]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[00:17:21.527 --> 00:17:22.308]  Energy all day.
[00:17:22.328 --> 00:17:30.054]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[00:17:30.494 --> 00:17:31.195]  Another review.
[00:17:31.215 --> 00:17:32.215]  I love this one.
[00:17:32.536 --> 00:17:34.977]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[00:17:35.358 --> 00:17:38.880]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:42.083]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[00:17:42.463 --> 00:17:43.985]  Here's another one ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:44.366 --> 00:17:47.731]  Five star review for Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[00:17:48.011 --> 00:17:51.196]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[00:17:51.276 --> 00:17:51.957]  I don't get sick.
[00:17:52.658 --> 00:17:55.983]  Last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[00:17:56.123 --> 00:17:57.104]  Amazing product.
[00:17:57.845 --> 00:17:59.906]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[00:18:00.326 --> 00:18:01.347]  Here's one from Brian.
[00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:03.728]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[00:18:03.848 --> 00:18:04.689]  Thank you all.
[00:18:05.089 --> 00:18:08.751]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[00:18:08.811 --> 00:18:11.032]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[00:18:11.412 --> 00:18:13.373]  Every night owl should have this product.
[00:18:13.853 --> 00:18:17.315]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:18.216]  And I should add,
[00:18:19.016 --> 00:18:20.137]  That's a great name for this product.
[00:18:20.397 --> 00:18:22.218]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[00:18:22.238 --> 00:18:23.959]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[00:18:24.299 --> 00:18:25.620]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.321]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[00:18:27.341 --> 00:18:27.901]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[00:18:28.162 --> 00:18:28.922]  I said I'd shut up!
[00:18:29.763 --> 00:18:30.583]  But back to the script.
[00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.824]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[00:18:32.864 --> 00:18:33.585]  I love that name too.
[00:18:34.025 --> 00:18:36.046]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[00:18:36.366 --> 00:18:40.549]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[00:18:40.589 --> 00:18:43.151]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:44.651]  You make it literally possible.
[00:18:45.712 --> 00:18:50.498]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million colloidal silver out there.
[00:18:51.058 --> 00:18:53.881]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[00:18:54.162 --> 00:18:57.706]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[00:18:58.226 --> 00:19:00.589]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be though, kind of.
[00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.931]  I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:06.393]  This was the first product I purchased from Inforestore.
[00:19:06.733 --> 00:19:12.597]  Whenever I feel the first haze of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[00:19:13.017 --> 00:19:18.761]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015 and it's worked for everyone.
[00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:25.626]  It has become an expected gift for our family and that's why we get you the best products because we want to repeat customers.
[00:19:25.886 --> 00:19:26.706]  It's all a win-win.
[00:19:26.867 --> 00:19:27.767]  That's an awesome review.
[00:19:27.807 --> 00:19:30.589]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family.
[00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:33.070]  We've only got 20 seconds left, folks.
[00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.091]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Caveman reviews.
[00:19:36.111 --> 00:19:37.292]  They're all five-star.
[00:19:37.552 --> 00:19:43.474]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[00:19:43.534 --> 00:19:46.836]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[00:19:47.116 --> 00:19:48.916]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[00:19:49.216 --> 00:19:52.738]  Find it all, folks, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:19:52.778 --> 00:19:57.900]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[00:20:05.856 --> 00:20:08.598]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.165 --> 00:20:29.850]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:37.787 --> 00:20:38.008]  Yeah.
[00:20:44.269 --> 00:20:52.375]  It's being reported 27 dead after a church was shot up in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
[00:20:52.715 --> 00:20:55.237]  Our very own Rob Dew is almost there.
[00:20:55.317 --> 00:20:58.199]  He will be reporting from the ground in the second hour.
[00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:01.961]  We will also be hearing from Alex Jones in the second hour.
[00:21:02.402 --> 00:21:10.928]  And we are currently waiting for the press conference from Sutherland Springs, which is actually at a community center there in the small town.
[00:21:12.193 --> 00:21:18.175]  I want to pull up this map for a second, guys, just so we can kind of show the people where this happened.
[00:21:19.215 --> 00:21:22.917]  I'm not familiar with these two roads, but I'm told it's kind of in the middle of 87 and 593.
[00:21:22.957 --> 00:21:24.477]  Is that right, guys?
[00:21:24.537 --> 00:21:24.697]  539 and 87.
[00:21:24.757 --> 00:21:28.659]  And this is, well, it's just east, pretty much, of San Antonio, just south here of Austin.
[00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:51.257]  Now, they're zooming out now so you can get a better idea, there you can see it just a bit southeast of San Antonio.
[00:21:52.618 --> 00:22:09.569]  Now here's something strange, and I mean, you know, get your conspiracy theories ready, but of all of the streets in Sutherland Springs, there's only one street corner where you cannot get a street view, and that is right in front of the church.
[00:22:11.383 --> 00:22:13.264]  So I don't know if that's of any significance.
[00:22:13.464 --> 00:22:15.105]  I don't know why that would be the case.
[00:22:17.465 --> 00:22:18.186]  Did they change that?
[00:22:18.386 --> 00:22:20.106]  Can you now have a street view of this church?
[00:22:22.367 --> 00:22:23.328]  Because you couldn't earlier.
[00:22:24.568 --> 00:22:24.988]  Interesting.
[00:22:26.069 --> 00:22:26.669]  Well, there you go.
[00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:31.291]  There you can see the site of the shooting today.
[00:22:31.391 --> 00:22:33.832]  I guess it's like jumping over that spot, isn't it, right there?
[00:22:34.212 --> 00:22:35.833]  It's jumping over that intersection, isn't it?
[00:22:36.093 --> 00:22:36.233]  Yeah.
[00:22:37.702 --> 00:22:38.002]  Okay.
[00:22:38.642 --> 00:22:50.026]  So I don't know what that's about, but obviously people were trying to get a Google Street View of the actual intersection where the church is located, and Google Street View does not allow you to do that.
[00:22:50.146 --> 00:22:51.907]  It makes you jump right over that intersection.
[00:22:52.727 --> 00:22:57.108]  So, just thought that was worth reporting for whatever it's worth.
[00:22:58.389 --> 00:23:02.210]  Now the FBI, it's been said, is taking over the investigation.
[00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.191]  We are waiting for the press conference.
[00:23:04.231 --> 00:23:05.391]  We will carry that live.
[00:23:06.926 --> 00:23:15.171]  But just look at all the Democrats that are already calling for gun control after this event.
[00:23:16.752 --> 00:23:17.412]  Truly sad.
[00:23:19.573 --> 00:23:20.193]  Truly sad.
[00:23:21.134 --> 00:23:30.839]  The typical candidates, Kamala Harris, Mike Thompson, Richard Blumenthal, Dick Durbin.
[00:23:33.481 --> 00:23:35.022]  So you have to ask yourself, folks,
[00:23:38.143 --> 00:23:54.774]  Are these politicians so agenda-driven to come after guns, come after the Second Amendment, that they prioritize the agenda to get rid of guns and to get rid of the Second Amendment higher than common sense?
[00:23:56.275 --> 00:23:58.417]  That is the question I'm asking these Democrats.
[00:23:58.457 --> 00:24:03.160]  Do you really put your agenda, your anti-gun agenda, above common sense?
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.861]  Because that's what you're doing today.
[00:24:06.382 --> 00:24:07.143]  And you're doing it
[00:24:08.456 --> 00:24:11.717]  Really within hours of the event happening.
[00:24:11.757 --> 00:24:15.018]  So they don't even wait a day now to hop right on this deal.
[00:24:15.378 --> 00:24:16.658]  That's how desperate they are.
[00:24:17.718 --> 00:24:26.220]  But when you completely forego common sense in order to push your political agenda, now you really have to wonder what these people are.
[00:24:28.261 --> 00:24:35.503]  Why is this gun, this anti-gun agenda so important to these people that they can't even deal in common sense?
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.220]  What am I talking about?
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.441]  What is the common sense here?
[00:24:39.941 --> 00:24:50.406]  50 people in a church, apparently 50 unarmed people, all get shot by reportedly a lone gunman.
[00:24:52.727 --> 00:25:03.571]  Let's say that you had one citizen in that church that had his concealed carry and was carrying today when the shooter entered the building and started shooting.
[00:25:05.336 --> 00:25:07.957]  Well, there would have been a fight, wouldn't there have been?
[00:25:08.177 --> 00:25:15.980]  There would have been a little pushback, and the shooter wouldn't have been able to go in there and shoot unabated.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:22.262]  But that isn't the thought process of these Democrats!
[00:25:23.757 --> 00:25:24.777]  It's, oh my gosh!
[00:25:25.398 --> 00:25:29.319]  If only we could have gotten rid of the gun in the first place!
[00:25:29.759 --> 00:25:32.120]  If only we could have signed that legislation!
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.381]  If only the NRA didn't exist!
[00:25:34.741 --> 00:25:38.483]  If only we could have pushed through all of our anti-gun legislation years ago!
[00:25:38.803 --> 00:25:42.124]  If only the Republicans didn't stand up for the Second Amendment!
[00:25:42.424 --> 00:25:44.125]  If only, if only, if only!
[00:25:45.185 --> 00:25:47.386]  These people live in an if-only world!
[00:25:47.626 --> 00:25:49.146]  They don't even live in reality!
[00:25:50.547 --> 00:25:50.787]  No.
[00:25:51.167 --> 00:25:52.628]  The real if-only, folks,
[00:25:53.624 --> 00:26:06.048]  Is if only one or two members of that congregation would have had their concealed carry and a pistol on them today, multiple lives would have been saved.
[00:26:07.469 --> 00:26:08.969]  Absolutely, 100%, without a doubt.
[00:26:12.677 --> 00:26:16.160]  Now here's a video from the church's YouTube channel.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:28.489]  They do record all of their Sunday congregations, so this begs the question, was the camera rolling and recording when this shooting happened, when the shooter entered the grounds?
[00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:32.832]  And if so, what comes of that footage?
[00:26:33.032 --> 00:26:34.873]  Does the FBI hide it forever?
[00:26:36.114 --> 00:26:38.136]  Has the FBI already confiscated it?
[00:26:38.236 --> 00:26:40.478]  Does the church have any say in their own
[00:26:41.809 --> 00:26:44.509]  Intellectual property, or does the FBI get to control that?
[00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:49.810]  That's what we will find out as we are waiting on the press conference.
[00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:53.391]  But here you can see the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs YouTube channel.
[00:26:54.031 --> 00:27:07.253]  They do upload all of their sermons, and I will tell you, obviously, these views have skyrocketed just since we've been on air, where most of these videos were at about 200, 300 views.
[00:27:07.353 --> 00:27:09.274]  Now you can see the most recent up over 2,000.
[00:27:11.653 --> 00:27:16.436]  And obviously, you know, everyone's concern is with the people of this community.
[00:27:16.456 --> 00:27:23.602]  It's going to be tough going to school tomorrow, I'm sure, for this community.
[00:27:23.622 --> 00:27:30.968]  It's going to be tough going to church, even, in this community and the other local churches.
[00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.213]  But I wonder, because see, I have a feeling
[00:27:37.284 --> 00:27:42.147]  That the people in this community are thinking, I'm going to take my gun with me from now on.
[00:27:42.708 --> 00:27:53.755]  I don't think the members of this congregation now, they can speak for themselves, but I feel like the first gut instinct reaction to this was, oh my gosh, I wish there was more gun control.
[00:27:54.115 --> 00:27:56.417]  Oh my gosh, I wish there was more gun legislation.
[00:27:56.757 --> 00:28:00.640]  Oh my gosh, I wish the Democrats shut down the NRA and shut down the Second Amendment.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:00.980]  No.
[00:28:02.438 --> 00:28:11.403]  Because people still live in reality and they know that millions and millions of guns have already hit the market and they don't go anywhere, folks.
[00:28:11.503 --> 00:28:14.824]  Guns are very durable and they stick around.
[00:28:14.964 --> 00:28:24.469]  Those guns aren't going anywhere and no matter what legislation any government wants to pass, those guns will still be on the street and criminals will still break the law.
[00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.691]  What was that last story, guys, as we go to break?
[00:28:28.783 --> 00:28:34.268]  Yep, Democrat Senator calls for gun control after shooting, before shooter even identified.
[00:28:36.831 --> 00:28:49.262]  Again, it just shows you folks, the agenda to take the guns, the anti-gun agenda, the anti-Second Amendment agenda, is more important to these people than common sense.
[00:28:50.287 --> 00:28:51.630]  They've shown their true colors.
[00:28:52.511 --> 00:28:54.134]  We aren't conspiracy theorists.
[00:28:54.555 --> 00:28:56.679]  They really do want the guns.
[00:28:56.719 --> 00:28:58.182]  They don't want you to have a gun.
[00:28:58.503 --> 00:29:00.687]  What do you think happens when they take the guns?
[00:29:01.008 --> 00:29:01.869]  More church shootings.
[00:29:03.584 --> 00:29:13.430]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:23.616]  And today we see the leftist, the globalist, controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[00:29:24.016 --> 00:29:26.978]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[00:29:27.578 --> 00:29:37.267]  Clothing is a statement, and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud, just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[00:29:37.727 --> 00:29:42.931]  So right now, folks, we're gonna debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the InfoWars store.
[00:29:43.992 --> 00:29:45.714]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[00:29:45.774 --> 00:29:46.715]  It's a limited edition.
[00:29:47.276 --> 00:29:49.278]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:56.246]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[00:29:56.566 --> 00:30:00.731]  On the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[00:30:00.991 --> 00:30:08.579]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows that organizations like CNN are owned by foreign multinational corporations, hell-bent on enslaving this country.
[00:30:08.879 --> 00:30:17.667]  So when you expose them as fake news, you're doing your patriotic duty, and you're exercising your First Amendment in defiance of their bullying, garbage, and tyranny.
[00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:22.272]  And on the back, InfoWars.com is the standard of real news.
[00:30:22.772 --> 00:30:23.873]  And of course, this classic?
[00:30:24.554 --> 00:30:25.155]  Says it all.
[00:30:25.275 --> 00:30:26.136]  Need I say more?
[00:30:26.636 --> 00:30:28.258]  You want to have a political message out there?
[00:30:28.278 --> 00:30:34.063]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[00:30:34.384 --> 00:30:37.467]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[00:30:37.927 --> 00:30:43.492]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[00:30:44.213 --> 00:30:46.556]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[00:30:46.876 --> 00:30:55.266]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[00:30:55.526 --> 00:30:59.111]  And this shirt, The Spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[00:30:59.911 --> 00:31:09.400]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Lambe or Come and Take It in good old-fashioned English t-shirts.
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:12.023]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:13.504]  InfoWars.com.
[00:31:13.524 --> 00:31:14.024]  Spread the word.
[00:31:14.765 --> 00:31:15.866]  I designed this baby.
[00:31:15.946 --> 00:31:18.367]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[00:31:18.767 --> 00:31:23.009]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:27.252]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[00:31:27.652 --> 00:31:30.353]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[00:31:30.373 --> 00:31:31.774]  It's been around about 19 years.
[00:31:32.394 --> 00:31:35.976]  It's the classic InfoWars tyranny response team shirt.
[00:31:36.256 --> 00:31:39.358]  And of course we've seen the NFL taking a knee.
[00:31:40.258 --> 00:31:43.859]  Uh, during the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.460]  That's disrespectful.
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:49.501]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[00:31:49.581 --> 00:31:57.024]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[00:31:57.424 --> 00:31:58.865]  Our republic is in distress.
[00:31:59.345 --> 00:31:59.805]  Ask me why.
[00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:02.408]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[00:32:02.568 --> 00:32:08.015]  Good old camouflage with the Dayglo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[00:32:08.555 --> 00:32:09.997]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[00:32:10.077 --> 00:32:13.061]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go ahead and put another shirt on.
[00:32:13.521 --> 00:32:15.684]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[00:32:16.305 --> 00:32:18.568]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[00:32:19.249 --> 00:32:20.030]  It's all about freedom.
[00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.412]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[00:32:21.933 --> 00:32:22.854]  Resist Tyranny.
[00:32:23.495 --> 00:32:24.477]  Made in America.
[00:32:24.497 --> 00:32:24.477]  1776.
[00:32:25.017 --> 00:32:28.222]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[00:32:28.422 --> 00:32:29.424]  The backs are really cool.
[00:32:29.764 --> 00:32:30.425]  Look at that back.
[00:32:30.485 --> 00:32:31.387]  That is pure Americana.
[00:32:32.631 --> 00:32:33.651]  And I almost forgot.
[00:32:33.752 --> 00:32:37.773]  We've got dozens and dozens of great limited edition ball caps available.
[00:32:37.893 --> 00:32:38.574]  The Dayglo.
[00:32:39.094 --> 00:32:43.176]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[00:32:43.336 --> 00:32:44.957]  This is my favorite ball cap.
[00:32:45.337 --> 00:32:46.677]  Over 20 ball caps we put out.
[00:32:46.877 --> 00:32:47.938]  It's got the nice patch.
[00:32:48.258 --> 00:32:49.318]  Infowars.com.
[00:32:49.539 --> 00:32:50.419]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[00:32:50.679 --> 00:32:54.101]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[00:32:54.521 --> 00:32:56.122]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[00:32:56.362 --> 00:33:01.144]  Thank you all for your support and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:33:05.954 --> 00:33:10.095]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.998 --> 00:33:31.260]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:52.480]  Well, I've got it.
[00:33:53.501 --> 00:33:55.342]  Because it's simply the truth.
[00:33:56.522 --> 00:34:00.624]  Democrats are now calling for more church shootings.
[00:34:01.565 --> 00:34:02.525]  That's what they're doing today.
[00:34:04.606 --> 00:34:04.866]  Yes.
[00:34:05.547 --> 00:34:05.807]  Go ahead.
[00:34:06.047 --> 00:34:06.827]  Tell your friends.
[00:34:07.167 --> 00:34:07.948]  Tell your family.
[00:34:09.329 --> 00:34:11.570]  Dems aren't calling for gun control, folks.
[00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.851]  You can't control an inanimate object.
[00:34:14.151 --> 00:34:14.971]  It doesn't do anything.
[00:34:16.592 --> 00:34:18.213]  You can sit the gun down on the table,
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.220]  There's your gun control.
[00:34:20.341 --> 00:34:21.121]  It's not going anywhere.
[00:34:21.281 --> 00:34:22.122]  It's not shooting anybody.
[00:34:22.222 --> 00:34:22.922]  It's doing nothing.
[00:34:24.443 --> 00:34:31.407]  Dems aren't calling for gun control today, folks, in wake of the church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
[00:34:31.487 --> 00:34:33.908]  No, Dems aren't calling for gun control.
[00:34:33.948 --> 00:34:35.549]  That's a misnomer.
[00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:36.930]  That's a misleading headline.
[00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:41.173]  What Dems are calling for today is more church shootings.
[00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:43.874]  That's the truth.
[00:34:45.075 --> 00:34:46.556]  That's what the Dems are calling for.
[00:34:47.606 --> 00:34:53.589]  More church shootings, more innocent victims, more tyranny, more criminals roaming the streets.
[00:34:56.991 --> 00:35:00.333]  Less of you being able to defend yourself.
[00:35:00.773 --> 00:35:02.634]  That's what the Dems are calling for today.
[00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:11.098]  No gun legislation, zero, zippity-doo-dah, could have stopped what happened today.
[00:35:12.499 --> 00:35:15.801]  No gun control legislation could have stopped what happened in Vegas.
[00:35:18.183 --> 00:35:20.004]  But the Democrats don't understand that, do they?
[00:35:20.164 --> 00:35:22.525]  They don't understand the concept that criminals break the law.
[00:35:23.166 --> 00:35:26.348]  It's funny that they wouldn't understand that, considering most of them are criminals.
[00:35:26.508 --> 00:35:29.750]  You'd think they would understand that mindset, but it seems to skip them.
[00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:31.030]  Here's Senator Bob Casey.
[00:35:32.511 --> 00:35:36.774]  In addition to offering my prayers and thoughts, I also believe Congress must take action on gun violence.
[00:35:37.314 --> 00:35:37.574]  Really?
[00:35:38.915 --> 00:35:40.776]  How do you take action on gun violence?
[00:35:42.837 --> 00:35:46.079]  I think we already have actions for gun violence, Senator Bob Casey.
[00:35:47.824 --> 00:35:48.404]  It's called arrest.
[00:35:49.305 --> 00:35:50.385]  It's called the justice system.
[00:35:51.886 --> 00:35:54.168]  And again, you know, actually, this is amazing.
[00:35:55.949 --> 00:36:08.896]  There were, of all of the footage that I went through of the Vegas shooting, just the people shooting on their cell phones, do you realize how many times you could hear people in these videos saying, I wish I brought my gun?
[00:36:09.717 --> 00:36:14.439]  Do you realize how many people were fleeing the scene saying, dang it, why didn't I bring my gun today?
[00:36:16.641 --> 00:36:21.203]  What do you think you wish you had when somebody walks into your church and starts shooting?
[00:36:21.223 --> 00:36:23.063]  What do you think the first thing you want is?
[00:36:24.864 --> 00:36:28.025]  Do you think the first thing you wish for is gun legislation?
[00:36:29.125 --> 00:36:30.626]  Oh my gosh, there's a shooter in my church!
[00:36:30.886 --> 00:36:31.566]  Gun legislation!
[00:36:31.586 --> 00:36:32.546]  We need gun legislation!
[00:36:33.687 --> 00:36:36.008]  Or do you think it's, oh my gosh, there's a shooter in my church!
[00:36:36.188 --> 00:36:37.028]  I wish I had a gun!
[00:36:37.048 --> 00:36:42.550]  And if you had a gun, you'd be reaching for the gun and you'd be pulling out
[00:36:45.043 --> 00:36:49.085]  And you'd be putting your training into execution, and you'd take down the shooter.
[00:36:49.485 --> 00:36:50.385]  And then you'd be a hero.
[00:36:50.705 --> 00:36:52.066]  But you're not allowed to be a hero!
[00:36:53.926 --> 00:36:56.427]  You're not allowed to defend yourself, you're not allowed to defend your church.
[00:36:56.527 --> 00:36:59.909]  No, the Democrats are going to do that for you by taking the guns.
[00:37:00.449 --> 00:37:00.569]  See?
[00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:03.350]  And it doesn't matter.
[00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:08.132]  It doesn't matter that all these people usually acquire these firearms illegally to begin with.
[00:37:09.195 --> 00:37:13.616]  It doesn't matter that there's already millions and millions of guns out on the streets already!
[00:37:13.636 --> 00:37:15.217]  That doesn't matter!
[00:37:15.237 --> 00:37:22.219]  It doesn't matter that the government, the FBI, the CIA have already been caught running guns illegally!
[00:37:22.519 --> 00:37:23.359]  None of that matters!
[00:37:23.439 --> 00:37:25.140]  We need more gun control!
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.520]  That's what the Democrats said!
[00:37:30.121 --> 00:37:36.463]  So congratulations to all the Democrats that showed their true colors today and called for gun control
[00:37:38.422 --> 00:37:51.393]  After an event where if there would have been a citizen on the scene with a gun, a good citizen with a gun, with his concealed carry, multiple lives would have been saved today.
[00:37:51.594 --> 00:37:53.615]  That is undoubtable.
[00:37:55.177 --> 00:38:01.662]  We are currently waiting right now for the press conference in Sutherland Springs, Texas
[00:38:02.642 --> 00:38:05.064]  But let that sink in, folks.
[00:38:05.144 --> 00:38:05.885]  This is the truth.
[00:38:06.446 --> 00:38:07.146]  This is the truth.
[00:38:07.206 --> 00:38:10.509]  The Democrats, they are not calling for gun control.
[00:38:10.529 --> 00:38:12.391]  They're calling for more church shootings.
[00:38:13.392 --> 00:38:14.573]  That's how we spin this.
[00:38:14.994 --> 00:38:16.915]  That's how we put this right back on them.
[00:38:17.536 --> 00:38:18.837]  You want to call for gun control?
[00:38:19.138 --> 00:38:20.379]  We'll call it what it really is.
[00:38:20.719 --> 00:38:22.461]  More church shootings.
[00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:28.524]  Yeah, Dick Durbin tweets out, this guy is such a piece of work.
[00:38:29.025 --> 00:38:31.927]  The shooter turned his gun on people, kids, in a place of worship.
[00:38:32.047 --> 00:38:34.728]  Since when did these people care about a place of worship if it's not a Muslim?
[00:38:35.169 --> 00:38:37.390]  America is in the grips of gun violence crisis.
[00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.770]  Really?
[00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:41.032]  Actually, the numbers are down unless you're in Chicago, a gun-free zone.
[00:38:41.433 --> 00:38:42.393]  Congress must act.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.282]  Again, what could Congress have done for the people in that church, folks?
[00:38:49.322 --> 00:38:51.803]  This is how loony these people are.
[00:38:51.823 --> 00:38:59.847]  This is how deranged and agenda-driven these people are, that they sacrifice and forfeit common sense for the agenda.
[00:39:01.408 --> 00:39:03.569]  Can you pull up Dick Durbin's tweet again for me real quick?
[00:39:07.411 --> 00:39:11.513]  Dick Durbin says, America is in grips of a gun violence crisis.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:22.811]  These same Democrats who will say we're in the grips of a gun violence crisis will never, ever, once say anything about radical Islamic terror.
[00:39:24.072 --> 00:39:25.394]  This is the Democrat mind.
[00:39:25.834 --> 00:39:28.677]  Radical Islamic terror doesn't exist.
[00:39:29.298 --> 00:39:32.121]  In fact, we've got a clip from Fareed Zakaria.
[00:39:32.381 --> 00:39:32.781]  You know what?
[00:39:34.103 --> 00:39:35.064]  Let's go to this clip right now.
[00:39:36.215 --> 00:39:40.337]  Let's go to Fareed Zakaria, because it's all the same mindset, folks.
[00:39:40.638 --> 00:39:43.299]  It's all the same deranged mindset.
[00:39:43.539 --> 00:39:47.922]  Here's Fareed Zakaria apologizing for radical Islamic terror.
[00:39:49.263 --> 00:39:56.667]  This week's tragic terror attack in New York was the kind of isolated incident by one troubled man that shouldn't lead to grand generalization.
[00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:57.687]  Pause it right there.
[00:40:00.009 --> 00:40:01.870]  One isolated event.
[00:40:02.915 --> 00:40:08.176]  He tells you, Fareed Zakaria, on fake news CNN, tells you one isolated event.
[00:40:08.516 --> 00:40:11.317]  No one has ever said allahu akbar and stabbed anyone ever before.
[00:40:11.517 --> 00:40:12.877]  Oh wait, it's happened dozens of times.
[00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:16.318]  No one's ever said allahu akbar and run people over on the streets with a vehicle.
[00:40:16.398 --> 00:40:18.519]  Oh wait, that's happened in multiple countries.
[00:40:18.939 --> 00:40:24.600]  And then here's Fareed Zakaria telling you it's a lone event, but then he discredits himself with what he says next!
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.080]  ...realizations.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:32.381]  In the 16 years since 9-11, the city has proved astonishingly safe from jihadists.
[00:40:32.561 --> 00:40:33.321]  Pause it right there!
[00:40:34.142 --> 00:40:38.903]  He says it's a lone event, then references 9-11!
[00:40:39.243 --> 00:40:41.683]  And references jihadi events!
[00:40:42.283 --> 00:40:45.984]  So he contradicts his own self in this clip!
[00:40:47.004 --> 00:40:54.406]  Folks, I'm telling you, you have to ask yourself, are these people that corrupt, or are they really that stupid?
[00:40:55.339 --> 00:40:59.901]  I mean, Fareed Zakaria, I mean, forget the fact he looks like the clown out of the Saw movie series.
[00:41:02.202 --> 00:41:03.042]  But don't you see, folks?
[00:41:03.222 --> 00:41:12.266]  So again, a guy runs people over, chants Allahu Akbar, and then Fareed Zakaria says, this is just a lone event.
[00:41:14.247 --> 00:41:15.507]  This is just a lone event.
[00:41:15.827 --> 00:41:18.488]  We shouldn't generalize people because of a lone event.
[00:41:18.869 --> 00:41:21.710]  Then references 9-11 when we went to war
[00:41:23.132 --> 00:41:26.254]  Against radical Islamic terror because they hate our way of life.
[00:41:27.135 --> 00:41:31.097]  He doesn't mention that because that would go against his theory that this was a lone event.
[00:41:32.178 --> 00:41:36.761]  Robb Dew has just entered the scene at the press conference in Sutherland Springs.
[00:41:37.681 --> 00:41:38.982]  He just flashed across the camera.
[00:41:39.002 --> 00:41:44.726]  But don't you see how this thought pattern is the same for all of them?
[00:41:47.219 --> 00:41:48.479]  You can't offend anyone.
[00:41:48.699 --> 00:41:51.260]  You don't even want to offend anyone because you're scared of your own shadow.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:56.421]  You're so politically correct and scared of your own shadow that you can't even report the truth.
[00:41:56.801 --> 00:42:11.525]  But then, it shows how one narrow-visioned you are in your own PC mind, censored mind, that you refute your own statement in the very next statement.
[00:42:14.686 --> 00:42:16.386]  So that's enough of Fareed Zakaria for now.
[00:42:18.154 --> 00:42:35.676]  Oh and notice also, so you have all these radical Islamic terrorist acts, no calls for immigration control, no calls for control over the visa diversity program, doesn't matter how many immigrants stabs, how about this one?
[00:42:36.932 --> 00:42:38.412]  Deadly Tennessee church shooting.
[00:42:38.672 --> 00:42:40.133]  Sudanese immigrant arrested.
[00:42:40.153 --> 00:42:41.973]  FBI launches civil rights investigation.
[00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:45.814]  A black Sudanese immigrant shoots up people in a church.
[00:42:46.054 --> 00:42:47.715]  The mainstream media ignores it.
[00:42:48.115 --> 00:42:50.275]  No call for immigration control by the Democrats.
[00:42:50.555 --> 00:42:52.676]  It's guns, guns, guns, guns.
[00:42:52.876 --> 00:42:59.378]  So today the Democrats called for more church shootings in America in their agenda to take the Second Amendment.
[00:42:59.618 --> 00:43:00.778]  We will not stand for it.
[00:43:03.052 --> 00:43:04.113]  Take a look at this study.
[00:43:18.012 --> 00:43:20.353]  That's a very important part of our human chemistry.
[00:43:20.593 --> 00:43:27.176]  So you already know that we live in an environment that is just loaded with toxic chemicals.
[00:43:27.637 --> 00:43:36.081]  Now they're finding that that environment is actually affecting babies in the prenatal stage, specifically when it comes to the telomeres.
[00:43:36.401 --> 00:43:40.983]  So now you have babies prematurely aging because of all the toxins.
[00:43:41.423 --> 00:43:42.924]  So what does InfoWars do, folks?
[00:43:43.225 --> 00:43:52.233]  We find a solution and we offer you the best, most groundbreaking product to deal with protecting and keeping your telomeres healthy.
[00:43:52.573 --> 00:43:56.777]  And that is DNA Force at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:44:02.582 --> 00:44:03.483]  25% off.
[00:44:03.744 --> 00:44:14.573]  We see the study that tells you your telomeres are under attack and we cut the price because we care about you and we want you to be fully healthy and aware to fight the new world order.
[00:44:14.833 --> 00:44:20.538]  So go to Infowarsstore.com, take advantage of DNA Force, protect your telomeres.
[00:44:20.839 --> 00:44:28.385]  Look at the science behind DNA Force for yourself and you will see why this product is groundbreaking for telomere protection.
[00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:31.987]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:44:33.967 --> 00:44:34.067]  U.S.
[00:44:34.127 --> 00:44:39.648]  President Donald Trump on Tuesday giving North Korea his most aggressive warning to date.
[00:44:39.728 --> 00:44:41.149]  President Trump is not a racist.
[00:44:41.409 --> 00:44:44.550]  I say red baseball caps mean you're an asshole.
[00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:49.271]  Tonight, the fight over confederate statues is now a flashpoint.
[00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:53.532]  Large groups of people punching, kicking, and hitting each other with sticks.
[00:44:53.772 --> 00:44:58.693]  If you see this and you understand what is going on and it makes you angry, do not take yourself out of the game.
[00:45:10.443 --> 00:45:17.471]  We're not going to stoop to the tactics of this authoritarian communist and fascists, funded by that dirtbag George Soros.
[00:45:17.751 --> 00:45:20.213]  To communists, it can't resist free stuff.
[00:45:20.714 --> 00:45:23.937]  You set up a booth, it says free stuff.
[00:45:24.257 --> 00:45:25.459]  We're going to keep our constitution.
[00:45:38.749 --> 00:45:41.211]  What do I do if one of these libtards calls me a Nazi?
[00:45:41.911 --> 00:45:42.412]  That's easy.
[00:45:42.432 --> 00:45:43.953]  You just put a pacifier in his mouth.
[00:45:44.613 --> 00:45:52.479]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.541]  One of these Antifa's get in my face.
[00:45:54.561 --> 00:46:00.065]  I'm gonna pull out my pocket constitution and stick it in his.
[00:46:03.447 --> 00:46:04.068]  Antifa?
[00:46:04.728 --> 00:46:05.369]  Never heard of him.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:07.761]  Never heard of the guy.
[00:46:08.381 --> 00:46:13.725]  They're going to lose on November 4th and every day after that because they're a bunch of meth-head pieces of crap.
[00:46:14.526 --> 00:46:20.091]  That's French for p***y. Holding our ground and not letting these bullies push us around.
[00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:21.792]  But not stooping to their level.
[00:46:21.832 --> 00:46:24.314]  I'm going to grab him by the antifa.
[00:46:25.686 --> 00:46:25.786]  Yeah.
[00:46:25.806 --> 00:46:27.808]  So on November 4th, we've got to do a thing.
[00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:29.050]  I think?
[00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:30.011]  Yeah, we're going to do a thing.
[00:46:30.471 --> 00:46:33.375]  America is an information-based civil war.
[00:46:33.775 --> 00:46:35.537]  We're winning that war thanks to you.
[00:46:36.058 --> 00:46:41.204]  And wearing t-shirts and InfoWars ball caps in public is one of the best ways to spread the word.
[00:46:41.524 --> 00:46:44.587]  The revolution starts now with you at InfoWarsTour.com.

[00:47:31.684 --> 00:47:35.167]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:47:35.727 --> 00:47:37.589]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:40.271 --> 00:47:41.552]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:41.672 --> 00:47:44.535]  Filling in for Alex today, I am Owen Schroer.
[00:47:44.815 --> 00:47:49.719]  We will be hearing from Alex Jones on the other side of this hour.
[00:47:50.239 --> 00:47:53.442]  So be sure to stick around for the latest reports from Alex Jones.
[00:47:53.462 --> 00:47:56.545]  Of course, he will be back tomorrow as well for the day show.
[00:47:57.574 --> 00:48:00.439]  We've got Rob Dew on the scene right now.
[00:48:00.579 --> 00:48:03.705]  He is in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
[00:48:03.745 --> 00:48:06.470]  He is at the community center where they're about to give the press conference.
[00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:08.333]  We're continuing to monitor that situation.
[00:48:08.373 --> 00:48:09.655]  But folks, in case you haven't noticed...
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.581]  InfoWars has reporters all over.
[00:48:12.621 --> 00:48:15.162]  We're putting reporters on the ground at all types of events.
[00:48:15.482 --> 00:48:21.865]  This is how we're able to get Rob down to the press conference here immediately because of your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:48:22.085 --> 00:48:31.490]  In fact, right now, as we're doing this broadcast, we are having our biggest studio being assembled just across the door from me right now.
[00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:33.931]  Another studio that Alex is about to launch
[00:48:34.651 --> 00:48:39.798]  As part of his expansion plans for InfoWars that you're seeing the fruits of already.
[00:48:39.838 --> 00:48:44.264]  But it's only possible when you go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:48:44.824 --> 00:48:50.912]  And we make it a win-win-win situation at InfoWarsStore.com by giving you great specials on great products.

[00:48:55.716 --> 00:48:57.197]  Take advantage of Brain Force Plus.
[00:48:57.798 --> 00:49:01.382]  The reviews that I get from Brain Force Plus are honestly unbelievable.
[00:49:01.422 --> 00:49:04.184]  We had another lady call into the show yesterday.
[00:49:04.645 --> 00:49:14.114]  Actually, it was a nice fella who called into the show yesterday who talked about his girlfriend after being in a serious car accident.
[00:49:14.875 --> 00:49:20.464]  Struggling with brain activity, started taking brain force and he noticed that her brain activity was kicking up again.
[00:49:21.045 --> 00:49:26.473]  And when she was taking brain force, she did better remembering names and dates and places, something she was struggling with before.
[00:49:26.994 --> 00:49:29.698]  These are the types of reviews we get.
[00:49:30.748 --> 00:49:37.574]  From products like Brain Force, DNA Force, and some of our other breakthrough products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:49:37.654 --> 00:49:40.496]  And Brain Force is still 50% off.
[00:49:40.836 --> 00:49:43.899]  DNA Force, you're hearing more about telomere health.
[00:49:44.319 --> 00:49:49.803]  Well, when you hear about that, think DNA Force at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:49:49.843 --> 00:49:52.065]  That is also 25% off.

[00:50:04.413 --> 00:50:07.154]  50% off Silver Bullet.

[00:50:49.636 --> 00:50:55.358]  Great health supplements, all kinds of stuff that you can purchase there to support this platform.
[00:50:55.938 --> 00:51:03.260]  I remember just a few years ago when I would go to the InfoWars store, the selection was probably a quarter of what it is now.
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:12.943]  We have seriously expanded our store and we plan to continue that expansion as we are expanding our broadcast here with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:51:12.963 --> 00:51:18.445]  So be sure to go to InfoWarsStore.com and take advantage of all of these specials before they sell out.
[00:51:19.858 --> 00:51:31.660]  All right, we're still keeping tabs on Rob Due as he is at the Community Center in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where they're about to give a press conference.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.781]  So, hey crew, if you guys could just keep me posted on that situation.
[00:51:36.821 --> 00:51:38.521]  It looks like they're still building the scene there.
[00:51:38.581 --> 00:51:39.961]  They're still getting some mics set up.
[00:51:42.042 --> 00:51:42.982]  Oh, there's Rob Due.
[00:51:43.102 --> 00:51:44.202]  He enters the fold here.
[00:51:44.342 --> 00:51:48.083]  I think Rob is either live now or about to go live.
[00:51:49.324 --> 00:51:51.405]  That's Rob Dew there sitting right in front of the camera.
[00:51:52.586 --> 00:51:56.128]  So, Rob Dew is obviously covering this live himself.
[00:51:56.668 --> 00:51:58.429]  Guys, is that on our Facebook channel?
[00:51:58.449 --> 00:52:04.633]  I'm going to have the crew back there get the exact area where you can find that of all of our things.
[00:52:04.733 --> 00:52:16.640]  Of course, we've got the Twitter, Real Alex Jones, InfoWars, we've got Facebook, we've got the YouTube, we've got everything, folks, and trying to figure out where you can find Rob Dew's live coverage of that.
[00:52:19.079 --> 00:52:22.160]  So Rob Dew is live somewhere right now.
[00:52:22.221 --> 00:52:23.121]  There he is right there.
[00:52:23.161 --> 00:52:28.864]  Okay, so you can find Rob Dew's broadcast also on the Alex Jones Channel on Facebook.
[00:52:29.184 --> 00:52:35.587]  So we'll be covering that as well as hearing from Alex himself in the next hour.
[00:52:35.667 --> 00:52:37.728]  So be sure to stay tuned to that.
[00:52:39.749 --> 00:52:40.809]  I want to mention one thing.
[00:52:40.829 --> 00:52:44.111]  I touched on this in a segment earlier.
[00:52:44.151 --> 00:52:45.832]  Now this is actually a story from September.
[00:52:45.892 --> 00:52:48.113]  Most people have probably never even heard about this story.
[00:52:49.591 --> 00:52:54.554]  Deadly Tennessee church shooting, Sudanese immigrant arrested, FBI launches civil rights investigation.
[00:52:54.614 --> 00:53:07.683]  So, this shooter went into a small town church in Tennessee, Emmanuel Kingata Samson from Sudan, and shot up the church, but it was never reported.
[00:53:09.082 --> 00:53:11.784]  You never saw a lick of this on television news.
[00:53:12.224 --> 00:53:15.686]  Now, this story is from Fox News, but folks, I'm telling you, I monitor all Fox News.
[00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:20.549]  Even Fox News barely even gave this any attention on their television shows.
[00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:35.658]  And today, when they're all going back, remembering all of the mass shootings that have happened, they mentioned the Vegas shooting, they mentioned the
[00:53:37.344 --> 00:53:40.406]  Shooting of the young guy that went into the church.
[00:53:40.626 --> 00:53:41.787]  I think that was in Charlottesville.
[00:53:41.807 --> 00:53:42.467]  I can't even remember.
[00:53:42.487 --> 00:53:42.927]  There's so many.
[00:53:42.947 --> 00:53:43.688]  Was that Charlotte?
[00:53:43.788 --> 00:53:46.609]  I can't even recall the guy's name now either.
[00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:51.212]  But they mention all these shootings and somehow they just left this one out.
[00:53:52.433 --> 00:53:57.496]  They just magically, magically just left this one out of the Sudanese immigrant.
[00:53:59.608 --> 00:54:01.230]  Going into the church and shooting people.
[00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:01.590]  Why?
[00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:05.453]  I wonder why they left that out.
[00:54:06.414 --> 00:54:17.104]  So that was strange to me and I wanted to pull that story today because I noticed that none of the news reporting is reporting on this story, which you would think you would report on.
[00:54:17.164 --> 00:54:22.349]  It's right along the lines to church shooting, to gunmen, but they don't report on it.
[00:54:22.429 --> 00:54:23.710]  I wonder if that's because the
[00:54:26.175 --> 00:54:30.840]  The killer in that situation was an immigrant from Sudan.
[00:54:32.182 --> 00:54:34.104]  I'm not sure, but nobody is mentioning that.
[00:54:35.085 --> 00:54:40.471]  So again, folks, if you're just joining us, the big news today is being reported.
[00:54:40.811 --> 00:54:46.857]  27 people have died in a mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
[00:54:48.004 --> 00:54:50.045]  And at least 30 others injured.
[00:54:50.085 --> 00:54:52.207]  The Democrats are already calling for guns.
[00:54:52.647 --> 00:54:53.648]  That's how it's being reported.
[00:54:53.708 --> 00:55:03.514]  The Democrats are actually calling for more short shootings because they don't want you to be able to defend yourself in your church if somebody like this came in and started shooting.
[00:55:03.574 --> 00:55:11.380]  No, the answer is learn how to use a gun, get your concealed carry, and protect yourself when you're in a situation like this.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.862]  And they always ignore the fact, the Democrats always ignore the fact that
[00:55:16.169 --> 00:55:26.193]  In the gun-free zones, just use Chicago as an example, more shootings than any other city, more gun violence than anywhere else is in the gun-free zones in Chicago.
[00:55:26.793 --> 00:55:31.395]  Amazing how gun-free zones don't seem to stay gun-free.
[00:55:31.415 --> 00:55:34.216]  Alright, well I'll tell you what we're going to do here.
[00:55:34.776 --> 00:55:42.339]  I'm going to just hit a couple other headlines before this news conference gets started and before we hear from Alex Jones on the other side.
[00:55:44.175 --> 00:55:46.677]  You know, Weinsteingate continues to crumble.
[00:55:47.617 --> 00:55:49.719]  This was a story from Business Insider today.
[00:55:49.999 --> 00:55:53.341]  All the men who have accused Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct.
[00:55:54.281 --> 00:55:59.925]  It started with Anthony Rapp saying he was assaulted by Spacey when he was 14.
[00:56:00.325 --> 00:56:07.150]  Now there's a whole list of them and it's... I've even heard reports that Spacey is seeking pedophilia therapy.
[00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:09.111]  Think about that.
[00:56:10.711 --> 00:56:17.673]  Now, if you asked one Alex Jones what pedophilia therapy would be, he would point to a ball-peen hammer upside the head.
[00:56:18.373 --> 00:56:24.275]  But somehow, Spacey, you know, I'm a pedophile, but I just have a problem.
[00:56:24.295 --> 00:56:25.415]  I just need therapy.
[00:56:26.155 --> 00:56:33.838]  No, dude, you are a sick, sick man that actually acted out your pedophilic desires.
[00:56:34.318 --> 00:56:35.378]  That's what people are saying.
[00:56:36.438 --> 00:56:37.699]  You don't go to therapy for that.
[00:56:37.819 --> 00:56:38.559]  You get arrested.
[00:56:39.522 --> 00:56:40.982]  I guess unless you're Kevin Spacey.
[00:56:41.583 --> 00:56:47.104]  But I have a bad feeling that this is only going to get worse for Kevin Spacey and for Hollywood.
[00:56:48.464 --> 00:56:53.225]  I don't know if you've heard about this one yet, but Rand Paul's neighbor decided to beat him up!
[00:56:54.246 --> 00:56:55.026]  Rand Paul!
[00:56:57.227 --> 00:57:02.768]  I mean, you want to talk about really a centrist, libertarian centrist, you've got to think about Rand Paul.
[00:57:04.372 --> 00:57:11.554]  But his neighbor, Rene Boshere, decided he was going to assault him and try to beat him up.
[00:57:13.134 --> 00:57:13.974]  So that's nice, though.
[00:57:14.394 --> 00:57:18.895]  I mean, you know, if you're a Republican, you deserve to get beat up.
[00:57:19.935 --> 00:57:22.456]  Especially because you won't take the guns from people!
[00:57:24.176 --> 00:57:25.357]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:57:25.797 --> 00:57:26.177]  You know what?
[00:57:28.035 --> 00:57:31.997]  House GOP quietly revises tax bill to tax income at higher rates over time.
[00:57:32.038 --> 00:57:37.341]  Folks, if you've seen this tax bill, it's actually a Democrat-looking tax bill.
[00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:43.585]  This tax bill is a tax bill that the left would rejoice and embrace.
[00:57:44.645 --> 00:57:48.808]  I wonder if all the Trump haters that want to tax the rich have seen this tax bill.
[00:57:48.828 --> 00:57:49.829]  Will they come around on Trump?
[00:57:49.929 --> 00:57:50.469]  Of course not.
[00:57:50.529 --> 00:57:51.950]  So then he's going to do something else.
[00:57:52.383 --> 00:57:53.444]  Take a look at this study.
[00:58:11.474 --> 00:58:16.520]  That we live in an environment that is just loaded with toxic chemicals.
[00:58:16.961 --> 00:58:23.108]  Now they're finding that that environment is actually affecting babies in the prenatal stage.
[00:58:23.408 --> 00:58:25.431]  Specifically when it comes to the telomeres.
[00:58:25.731 --> 00:58:30.337]  So now you have babies prematurely aging because of all the toxins.
[00:58:30.737 --> 00:58:32.239]  So what does InfoWars do, folks?
[00:58:32.559 --> 00:58:46.112]  We find a solution, and we offer you the best, most groundbreaking product to deal with protecting and keeping your telomeres healthy, and that is DNA Force at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:59:34.439 --> 00:59:35.539]  This is the Infowar.
[00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:58.712]  You are receiving this transmission.
[00:59:58.792 --> 01:00:00.574]  You are the Resistance.
[01:00:04.959 --> 01:00:05.539]  Another world.
[01:00:05.759 --> 01:00:06.861]  Another time.
[01:00:07.121 --> 01:00:08.662]  In the Age of Wonder.
[01:00:26.619 --> 01:00:35.281]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this original worldwide broadcast Sunday.
[01:00:52.594 --> 01:00:55.216]  Hard to believe, already, November 5th, 2017.
[01:00:55.897 --> 01:01:00.560]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:14.691]  Owen Schroer is going to be joining me, covering the massive failure of the George Soros-funded communist uprising that was supposed to begin yesterday, culminating in the next few weeks.
[01:01:15.191 --> 01:01:19.455]  With the overthrow of our republic and the driving of President Trump from office.
[01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:25.900]  We're going to be detailing that coming up with Owen, who's going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.041]  In the meantime...
[01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:44.480]  We're not just seeing democratic revolutions in Catalan, Spain, and Reykjavik, Iceland, and Austria, and Czech Republic, and elections in the UK, and Brexit, and Australia, and Brazil, and all over Africa, and Latin America, and Asia.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:51.204]  We're seeing major rebellions against the globalist program in the most unlikely of places, Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:52.711 --> 01:01:58.636]  The first trip that Trump was involved in, eight, nine months ago when he first got in office, was to Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:58.656 --> 01:02:05.162]  And the whole famous orb thing he did that was just a controller for a threat fusion anti-terrorism center that they'd built.
[01:02:06.243 --> 01:02:16.793]  And he went there to expose the different royal family members that were involved with the Bushes, with the Clintons, with Google, with Facebook.
[01:02:18.044 --> 01:02:26.769]  And others, pushing the Arab-Wahhabi spring that threatened to even overthrow Saudi Arabia itself, where that form of Islam actually comes from.
[01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:39.637]  And the deal that was struck was, they would stop backing ISIS and Al-Qaeda, and the United States would then stop being basically soft-handed, or wearing kid gloves with Iran.
[01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:41.338]  That deal was made.
[01:02:42.158 --> 01:02:44.540]  And now, eight plus months after that deal was made,
[01:02:45.745 --> 01:02:55.931]  You have these top princelings and others that are stakeholders in News Corp, in Citigroup, Fox News, you name it, being arrested.
[01:02:56.471 --> 01:03:02.494]  These are the very people helping fund the anti-Trump movements with Soros here in the United States.
[01:03:02.594 --> 01:03:08.358]  So all over the world, globalism is in deep trouble, and we're going to break down
[01:03:09.588 --> 01:03:16.957]  The situation unfolding in Saudi Arabia, where an ICBM also was fired yesterday that hit near their airport.
[01:03:17.217 --> 01:03:18.799]  There's a lot of craziness going on.
[01:03:19.239 --> 01:03:25.887]  But first, when we return, the collapse of the Democratic Party establishment.
[01:03:26.167 --> 01:03:30.990]  Because the witch Hillary refused to leave, the Soros-funded creature Hillary.
[01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:55.205]  We now learn that Donna Brazile, the head of the DNC, feared for her life after top DNC staffer over email Seth Rich was executed, shot in the back, and that basically she believed that Hillary and the DNC were behind it, and that she knew that there were reports of their servers being hacked by Pakistan, China, Russia, you name it, and tried to stop it, and that Hillary and others said, don't do it.
[01:03:55.825 --> 01:04:01.968]  That's the latest shoe to drop as Donna Brazile separates herself from these individuals.
[01:04:02.028 --> 01:04:03.588]  Now, I don't just believe Donna Brazile.
[01:04:04.209 --> 01:04:08.250]  I know from my own deep research that what she's saying is true.
[01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:12.192]  And our listeners know we covered all this first as you get
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.520]  Yes, we are.
[01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:36.454]  The old New World Order fall and a new system of nationalism and free market coming in.
[01:04:36.774 --> 01:04:37.554]  This is incredible.
[01:04:37.614 --> 01:04:38.455]  It's accelerated.
[01:04:38.715 --> 01:04:40.236]  It's happening faster than I thought.
[01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:44.059]  It's a very exciting time, but also a very dangerous time to be alive.
[01:04:44.419 --> 01:04:45.160]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.321]  This is the InfoWars.
[01:04:46.681 --> 01:04:47.762]  InfoWars.com.
[01:04:47.802 --> 01:04:48.722]  NewsWars.com.
[01:04:48.962 --> 01:04:50.143]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:04:50.183 --> 01:04:50.764]  Please stay with us.
[01:05:03.347 --> 01:05:03.636]  You got it.
[01:05:05.456 --> 01:05:08.858]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:05:09.219 --> 01:05:16.343]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:05:16.964 --> 01:05:25.369]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:29.692]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:05:30.012 --> 01:05:35.156]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:05:35.576 --> 01:05:39.438]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:05:39.819 --> 01:05:43.040]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:54.327]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:05:54.387 --> 01:05:57.068]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[01:05:57.288 --> 01:06:03.272]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:06:05.014 --> 01:06:06.017]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:06.137 --> 01:06:08.022]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:15.031 --> 01:06:16.431]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:17.632 --> 01:06:19.433]  Sunday, November 5th, 2017.
[01:06:19.473 --> 01:06:28.236]  And the entire globalist crime syndicate, the entire international crime order, the New World Order, is coming down.
[01:06:28.596 --> 01:06:32.337]  Because it's authoritarian and abusive of the nation, states, and individuals.
[01:06:32.777 --> 01:06:35.518]  And Donald Trump is a leading captain in that fight.
[01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:39.219]  But all of you are on the front lines of this huge awakening.
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:40.860]  Donna Brazile!
[01:06:41.892 --> 01:06:46.555]  The former head of the DNC has come out and said Hillary stole the election from Bernie Sanders.
[01:06:47.156 --> 01:06:48.416]  I don't need to hear that from her.
[01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:49.197]  It's a fact.
[01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:55.541]  But I know she's telling the truth because what she's written about and gone public about in her new book is what happened at the time.
[01:06:55.821 --> 01:06:56.702]  It's all confirmed.
[01:06:57.062 --> 01:06:57.883]  But bigger than that,
[01:06:58.383 --> 01:07:13.175]  Mainstream media, CNN, MSNBC, Wolf Blitzer, Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, they're all turning against the Clintons now because they know there's no way they can cover up the crimes they've committed.
[01:07:14.176 --> 01:07:16.457]  So they're trying to distance themselves from it.
[01:07:16.518 --> 01:07:17.498]  That's not going to work.
[01:07:17.558 --> 01:07:21.542]  But here is the giant, brutal, massive bombshell.
[01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:27.250]  We broke first that they rigged the nomination process against Bernie Sanders.
[01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:30.031]  We've been proven correct in triplicate.
[01:07:30.431 --> 01:07:31.971]  So again, we're the real news.
[01:07:32.471 --> 01:07:34.772]  MSNBC, the rest, they're the fake news.
[01:07:35.332 --> 01:07:42.514]  We also broke that Seth Rich clearly was executed and murdered as the head staffer over the emails for the DNC.
[01:07:42.774 --> 01:07:47.615]  There were major homeland security investigations over Pakistan, India, Russia,
[01:07:48.035 --> 01:07:53.457]  China, the EU, in our servers, Hillary's illegal servers, they wanted to cover it up.
[01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:57.658]  Donna Brazile has now come out and said she wanted to go to Homeland Security.
[01:07:57.878 --> 01:08:04.040]  She tried to get Jay Johnson involved and Hillary and others said shut up, don't look at it, don't investigate it.
[01:08:04.701 --> 01:08:05.221]  Incredible.
[01:08:05.421 --> 01:08:11.043]  But that pales in significance to the headline at Infowars.com from her book.
[01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:17.866]  Donna Brazile says she feared for her life after Seth Rich was killed.
[01:08:18.827 --> 01:08:26.872]  And that she basically thought the DNC or others were going to try to kill her to cover up what she knew about whatever was happening in those servers.
[01:08:27.332 --> 01:08:30.033]  This is the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[01:08:30.494 --> 01:08:33.736]  Donna Brazile is controlled by Biden, by Obama, and others.
[01:08:34.056 --> 01:08:36.697]  And they're trying to compartmentalize now the danger.
[01:08:37.017 --> 01:08:37.738]  But think about this.
[01:08:38.178 --> 01:08:39.039]  We got hammered.
[01:08:39.099 --> 01:08:39.820]  We got attacked.
[01:08:39.881 --> 01:08:44.707]  We got demonized for being the first to expose that Seth Rich was a political murderer.
[01:08:45.108 --> 01:08:53.939]  Then WikiLeaks came out and said, we don't normally give up sources, but basically he's our source, and we've got a big reward for whoever finds out who killed him.
[01:08:55.086 --> 01:08:56.407]  That's why they're now so desperate.
[01:08:56.807 --> 01:09:03.549]  And the fact that the Democratic Party establishment is running from the Clintons right now shows you the whole house of cards is coming down.
[01:09:03.869 --> 01:09:04.950]  Who else deserves credit?
[01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:06.630]  You, the listeners, for taking action.
[01:09:06.991 --> 01:09:11.712]  Sean Hannity almost got fired overexposing all this, but he didn't back down.
[01:09:13.473 --> 01:09:20.238]  Held the line, stood firm, held fast, is an example of stalwart action in the face of tyranny.
[01:09:20.258 --> 01:09:25.522]  Now I'm going to read over some of the transcripts of her book here, getting into this in a moment.
[01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:28.665]  But first I want to play Roger Stone, Last Night.
[01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:44.015]  First, before anybody else had read the book and found this, he broke the news last night, live with us on air as we were ending our marathon broadcast covering Antifa's failed November 4th so-called revolution that I'll cover later.
[01:09:44.455 --> 01:09:57.604]  And again, it's up to all of us to push this story out there, because other than Drudge and Zero Hedge and Infowars, hardly anybody is covering the fact that Donna Brazile feared for her life after Seth Rich was executed.
[01:09:58.124 --> 01:10:01.326]  Vindicating everything we said, everything you said.
[01:10:01.666 --> 01:10:07.029]  I mean, every day, huge new developments drop, proving we were dead on.
[01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:10.211]  Here's Roger Stone, reporting from Florida last night.
[01:10:11.172 --> 01:10:13.273]  This is Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[01:10:13.993 --> 01:10:23.297]  Former DNC big Donna Brazile dropped a bombshell in her new book when she admitted that she feared for her life in the wake of the murder of Seth Rich.
[01:10:24.117 --> 01:10:28.379]  That means that Brazile knew that Rich had been murdered for political purposes.
[01:10:29.119 --> 01:10:39.091]  One need look only at the interview with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks where he says three times in regard to Rich that sources to WikiLeaks are in great physical danger.
[01:10:39.111 --> 01:10:44.657]  And then he posts a $25,000 reward for apprehension of Seth Rich's murderer.
[01:10:44.977 --> 01:10:46.499]  What more do you need to know?
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.722]  Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[01:10:50.635 --> 01:10:53.416]  What more do you need, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:10:53.516 --> 01:11:12.824]  Donna Brazile, the former head of the DNC, has now come out publicly and said, I fear for my life, Seth Rich was probably murdered politically to cover up corruption in the DNC and a bunch of foreign countries inside our servers, and I'm not involved, and I'm not going to prison with the Clintons.
[01:11:14.044 --> 01:11:20.167]  This days after she comes out and confirms what already we all know, it happened publicly, but the media covered it up.
[01:11:21.437 --> 01:11:25.169]  That the nomination was stolen from Bernie Sanders.
[01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:26.232]  He won!
[01:11:27.476 --> 01:11:28.378]  Most of the states!
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.081]  But then they would just give him the delegates!
[01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:43.366]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an example of pure, unadulterated, incredible arrogance of people thinking that they were invincible and could get away with anything.
[01:11:43.406 --> 01:11:44.806]  But I'm starting to get freaked out.
[01:11:45.587 --> 01:11:57.331]  I mean, everything we've talked about is now being confirmed on a daily basis that Trump was about to take down the Wahhabist and the ISIS supporters in Saudi Arabia.
[01:11:57.351 --> 01:11:58.432]  It just happened this weekend.
[01:11:59.597 --> 01:12:02.200]  That China was going to have to back down in their trade war.
[01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:02.881]  Starting to happen.
[01:12:03.602 --> 01:12:05.344]  That Trump was going to release the JFK files.
[01:12:05.384 --> 01:12:05.804]  He did it.
[01:12:06.926 --> 01:12:08.287]  Just everything.
[01:12:08.607 --> 01:12:12.031]  CNN emits fluorides causing brain damage in children.
[01:12:12.051 --> 01:12:13.874]  That vaccines are killing people.
[01:12:14.354 --> 01:12:19.880]  I mean, we are seeing a collapse, ladies and gentlemen, in the globalist operation.
[01:12:20.561 --> 01:12:22.663]  And it's all because of you taking action.
[01:12:22.944 --> 01:12:29.810]  We're seeing nationalists and pro-populists and pro-capitalists winning all over the world, minute by minute.
[01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:33.854]  This is like sudden-death overtime in a football game that never ends.
[01:12:34.035 --> 01:12:36.117]  It is so riveting!
[01:12:37.898 --> 01:12:42.101]  Here's a ZRO Hedge article that we have linked up on Infowars.com that came out today.
[01:12:42.121 --> 01:12:47.185]  We have our video breaking it last night embedded inside with Roger Stone.
[01:12:47.486 --> 01:12:48.586]  Let's read over some of this.
[01:12:49.027 --> 01:12:55.052]  Donna Brazile says she feared for her life, close quote, after Seth Rich was killed, executed.
[01:12:55.752 --> 01:13:04.238]  Just the fact that Brazil says she too suspected that some nefarious might have be afoot is reason enough to take a second look at his death.
[01:13:04.658 --> 01:13:13.204]  Well look at how desperate they were to demonize anybody that looked at it to say you hated the family or you were a bad person when the family first questioned it as well.
[01:13:13.605 --> 01:13:15.086]  Then how people changed their stories.
[01:13:15.486 --> 01:13:17.948]  I mean this was the machine in motion.
[01:13:19.933 --> 01:13:28.559]  She says top Democrats initially instructed her not to discuss her concerns with others about the fact of how compromised the servers were.
[01:13:29.179 --> 01:13:49.233]  Her fears only intensifies, she says, after the mysterious shooting of former campaign staffer Seth Ridge, who the authorities said was killed during a robbery, though many so-called conspiracy theorists, that means questioning known liars, have speculated about the possible Democratic plot to kill Seth Ridge for his role in leaking the stash of DNC emails to WikiLeaks.
[01:13:49.833 --> 01:13:58.486]  Brazil's anxiety eventually spiraled out of control to the point where she feared her own life while serving as interim chairman of the DNC.
[01:13:59.867 --> 01:13:59.987]  Wow!
[01:14:24.659 --> 01:14:30.361]  Ladies and gentlemen, I do not have words to describe to you right now how incredible this is.
[01:14:30.962 --> 01:14:47.849]  Everything we've talked about, about the IMF and World Bank wanting world government, and about the plan to bankrupt the government and get rid of the borders, and the plan to break up the family, and the plans for communist revolution, and all of it is falling flat on its face.
[01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:52.711]  I cannot express to you words enough of how important this is.
[01:14:53.803 --> 01:14:55.065]  The globalists were arrogant.
[01:14:55.105 --> 01:14:57.749]  They hijacked America while we were sleeping.
[01:14:58.050 --> 01:15:01.275]  They used our energy and power to expand their control worldwide.
[01:15:01.676 --> 01:15:07.805]  But as soon as we woke up, you could hear the brakes being slammed like a car wreck.
[01:15:09.127 --> 01:15:10.228]  And now it's a whole new world.
[01:15:10.828 --> 01:15:18.932]  But it's up to us to be moral and be good and be strong and not just throw out one kleptocratic regime that thought it was invincible.
[01:15:20.092 --> 01:15:24.334]  To bring in a new set of systems, we've got to maintain our vigilance.
[01:15:24.614 --> 01:15:29.657]  We have to promote the republic, promote being chivalrous, promote the free market, and promote
[01:15:30.277 --> 01:15:37.081]  Staying focused and honoring questioning big government and corruption, not demonizing it as being a conspiracy theorist.
[01:15:37.401 --> 01:15:40.603]  We used to call that an involved, informed, active citizen.
[01:15:41.143 --> 01:15:44.465]  Praise God for what's happening and thank all of you for taking action.
[01:15:44.705 --> 01:15:49.428]  Without you, the info warriors of every race, color, and creed, we'd be up the creek without a paddle.
[01:15:49.688 --> 01:15:54.671]  We'll be back with the fall of the globalist control of Saudi Arabia straight ahead.
[01:16:02.315 --> 01:16:06.638]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[01:16:07.119 --> 01:16:12.162]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[01:16:12.703 --> 01:16:16.626]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[01:16:16.646 --> 01:16:19.968]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[01:16:20.629 --> 01:16:25.072]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[01:16:25.712 --> 01:16:28.975]  It's you the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[01:16:29.655 --> 01:16:31.197]  I came in here an hour ago.
[01:16:31.957 --> 01:16:39.179]  And I literally just went to Infowarsstore.com and printed the 5-star reviews, the first few pages.
[01:16:39.479 --> 01:16:43.281]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[01:16:43.861 --> 01:16:47.342]  And it's 5-star after 5-star after 5-star.
[01:16:47.702 --> 01:16:49.402]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[01:16:49.843 --> 01:16:56.185]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:16:56.225 --> 01:16:57.125]  Let's go over them right now.
[01:16:57.665 --> 01:16:59.186]  This is Verified Buyer Mark.
[01:16:59.367 --> 01:17:01.428]  Five-star review for Anthroplex.
[01:17:01.448 --> 01:17:02.329]  It's for men and women.
[01:17:02.809 --> 01:17:03.850]  I take it as directed.
[01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:14.760]  As one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.001]  Easy does it.
[01:17:16.081 --> 01:17:17.102]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[01:17:17.122 --> 01:17:18.063]  It's very, very serious.
[01:17:18.483 --> 01:17:18.883]  Not a game.
[01:17:18.923 --> 01:17:19.324]  Thank you, Mark.
[01:17:19.844 --> 01:17:21.124]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[01:17:21.244 --> 01:17:22.045]  Energy all day.
[01:17:22.065 --> 01:17:29.787]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[01:17:30.207 --> 01:17:30.927]  Another review.
[01:17:30.947 --> 01:17:31.947]  I love this one.
[01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:34.688]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[01:17:35.068 --> 01:17:38.589]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[01:17:38.849 --> 01:17:41.770]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:43.711]  Here's another one, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:44.091 --> 01:17:47.452]  Five Star Review for Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[01:17:47.732 --> 01:17:50.913]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[01:17:50.973 --> 01:17:55.694]  I don't get sick last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[01:17:55.835 --> 01:17:56.815]  Amazing product.
[01:17:57.555 --> 01:17:59.636]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[01:18:00.056 --> 01:18:01.056]  Here's one from Brian.
[01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:03.457]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[01:18:03.577 --> 01:18:04.398]  Thank you all.
[01:18:04.798 --> 01:18:08.459]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[01:18:08.519 --> 01:18:10.740]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:13.081]  Every night owl should have this product.
[01:18:13.581 --> 01:18:17.022]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[01:18:17.262 --> 01:18:17.923]  And I should add,
[01:18:18.723 --> 01:18:19.864]  That's a great name for this product.
[01:18:20.104 --> 01:18:21.945]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[01:18:21.965 --> 01:18:23.686]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[01:18:24.006 --> 01:18:25.347]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[01:18:25.427 --> 01:18:27.028]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[01:18:27.068 --> 01:18:27.628]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[01:18:27.869 --> 01:18:28.629]  I said I'd shut up!
[01:18:29.469 --> 01:18:30.310]  But back to the script.
[01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:32.551]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[01:18:32.571 --> 01:18:33.312]  I love that name too.
[01:18:33.752 --> 01:18:35.773]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[01:18:36.073 --> 01:18:40.256]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:42.878]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[01:18:42.938 --> 01:18:44.378]  You make it literally possible.
[01:18:45.419 --> 01:18:50.245]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality 30 parts per million colloidal silver out there.
[01:18:50.765 --> 01:18:53.588]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[01:18:53.869 --> 01:18:57.433]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[01:18:57.953 --> 01:19:00.316]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be though, kind of.
[01:19:00.396 --> 01:19:03.658]  So, I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[01:19:03.998 --> 01:19:06.100]  This was the first product I purchased from Inforestore.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:12.304]  Whenever I feel the first traces of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[01:19:12.724 --> 01:19:18.468]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015 and it's worked for everyone.
[01:19:18.968 --> 01:19:25.353]  It has become an expected gift for our family and that's why we get you the best products because we want the repeat customers.
[01:19:25.613 --> 01:19:26.413]  It's all a win-win.
[01:19:26.594 --> 01:19:27.474]  That's an awesome review.
[01:19:27.534 --> 01:19:30.316]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family.
[01:19:30.736 --> 01:19:32.796]  Well, I got 20 seconds left, folks.
[01:19:32.856 --> 01:19:35.817]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Caveman reviews.
[01:19:35.837 --> 01:19:37.017]  They're all five-star.
[01:19:37.257 --> 01:19:43.198]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[01:19:43.258 --> 01:19:46.539]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[01:19:46.839 --> 01:19:48.639]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[01:19:48.939 --> 01:19:52.460]  Find it all, folks, at m4warsstore.com or m4warslife.com.
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.541]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[01:20:05.814 --> 01:20:08.417]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:31.101 --> 01:20:37.026]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:20:37.066 --> 01:20:38.387]  It's Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:38.587 --> 01:20:41.049]  We are living in the season of change.
[01:20:41.409 --> 01:20:47.193]  True change, not Barack Obama's change that meant more globalism, more socialism, more command and control.
[01:20:47.233 --> 01:20:55.960]  No, we're living in the true season of change where all over the world, every week, nation states vote to rediscover and reclaim their sovereignty.
[01:20:57.239 --> 01:20:59.740]  And one place that's happening is in Saudi Arabia.
[01:21:00.281 --> 01:21:08.025]  But before I hit this giant news, here's an article by Paul Joseph Watson on Friday from Infowars.com.
[01:21:08.645 --> 01:21:16.789]  Obama-era FBI assistant director of the FBI says, quote, Americans must accept terror attacks as the price of diversity.
[01:21:17.850 --> 01:21:21.592]  And you've got Brennan, who converted to Islam, who became the head of the CIA.
[01:21:22.432 --> 01:21:23.553]  You had the Bushes.
[01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:30.278]  who made deals with Saudi Arabia to literally sell out Europe and the West to Islam.
[01:21:31.779 --> 01:21:35.781]  That continued under Obama and the Muslim Brotherhood and the same Wahhabist groups.
[01:21:36.001 --> 01:21:39.343]  Under Trump, in 10 months, that's all been changed.
[01:21:39.983 --> 01:21:51.850]  Saudi Arabia was told, you can keep your power, you can keep your country, you can keep your kingdom, but Wahhabism is over, your imperialistic Islamic expansion is over, and if you don't do that, we're going to overthrow you.
[01:21:53.345 --> 01:21:59.229]  So Trump, months ago, traveled to Saudi Arabia, met with them, and they had agreed to do that.
[01:21:59.749 --> 01:22:04.533]  We then saw terror attacks intensify because there's subgroups in Saudi Arabia that didn't want to do it.
[01:22:04.553 --> 01:22:11.637]  A few years ago, Russia was threatened by Prince Bandar, who's been part of the group that's been grabbed and arrested.
[01:22:12.768 --> 01:22:17.789]  And they said to the Russians, if you don't back off in Syria, we're going to launch attacks on the Olympics at Sochi.
[01:22:17.829 --> 01:22:20.650]  We're going to launch attacks on your tourism centers.
[01:22:21.090 --> 01:22:23.850]  And Russia doubled down and didn't back off and stopped them.
[01:22:24.450 --> 01:22:41.374]  Well, clearly from my intel, Saudi Arabian criminal elements, as we reported last week and the week before, were involved in the attacks in Las Vegas as a message to Trump and others that if you don't back off, we're going to not just use Islamic attackers, we're going to use deep state mercenary groups to do this.
[01:22:42.543 --> 01:22:53.349]  Now, we've seen a purge against all the big top princes that owned News Corp, and owned Citigroup, and were part of this whole leftist globalist operation.
[01:22:55.092 --> 01:23:08.295]  The main prince that was running the operation, again, is somebody that said Trump will be removed, an ever-Trumper, and a guy still financing, as we said, during the campaign, hundreds of millions against Trump and currently trying to throw him out.
[01:23:08.755 --> 01:23:15.536]  So, understand, the guy involved in our election, involved funding ISIS, you name it, has now been arrested.
[01:23:16.077 --> 01:23:17.357]  Think Trump's visit had an effect?
[01:23:18.396 --> 01:23:18.816]  Purge!
[01:23:18.937 --> 01:23:23.141]  Saudi King arrests Prince's cabinet members in anti-corruption crackdown.
[01:23:23.521 --> 01:23:27.805]  Billionaire Prince and 38 cabinet members charged with corruption and money laundering.
[01:23:28.285 --> 01:23:34.732]  And CNN has these sickening headlines about the incredible, the amazing Prince has been arrested.
[01:23:35.512 --> 01:23:36.793]  He funds leftist movements.
[01:23:37.154 --> 01:23:39.736]  He's been working with Iran to double-cross Saudi Arabia.
[01:23:40.217 --> 01:23:41.278]  I mean, a true globalist.
[01:23:42.461 --> 01:24:04.197]  In a shocking development, Saudi press Al-Madin reported late Saturday that prominent billionaire member of the Royal Saudi family and one of the biggest shareholders of City News Corp, that's Fox, and Twitter, not to mention, notice you can't criticize Islam on Twitter when they're calling for killing you, not to mention frequent CNBC guest, Alawid bin Talal, that CNN worships.
[01:24:04.217 --> 01:24:09.901]  Go to CNN's website, they literally call him the Incredible Prince, along with 10, because he finances half the network,
[01:24:10.801 --> 01:24:21.689]  10 senior princes and some 38 ministers have been arrested for corruption and money laundering charges on orders from the new Anti-Corruption Committee headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salam and Royal Prince.
[01:24:22.150 --> 01:24:23.751]  Private planes have all been grounded.
[01:24:25.092 --> 01:24:25.853]  So there you go!
[01:24:25.873 --> 01:24:28.395]  Yeah, oh, you're gonna stop Trump?
[01:24:28.415 --> 01:24:29.455]  You're gonna stop America?
[01:24:29.475 --> 01:24:30.516]  You're gonna kick us around?
[01:24:30.536 --> 01:24:33.498]  Gonna have Saudi intelligence go threaten talk show host?
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.982]  Think that's gonna really have an effect with people here in America?
[01:24:39.687 --> 01:24:55.240]  You don't think that they don't understand, the patriots in our government, that if talk show hosts can be pushed around, and if business owners can be pushed around, and if patriotic stock companies can be pushed around, and threatened by people, that they won't be threatened next?
[01:24:56.261 --> 01:24:59.344]  You don't think that, you don't think we don't know what's been going on?
[01:24:59.404 --> 01:25:03.147]  You don't think we're about to rip your arms out from their sockets?
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:07.181]  So you want political war?
[01:25:07.621 --> 01:25:08.282]  You got it!
[01:25:08.402 --> 01:25:10.703]  You got it on all fronts now!
[01:25:11.303 --> 01:25:12.084]  Hundreds of fronts!
[01:25:12.384 --> 01:25:13.264]  We're coming in!
[01:25:13.604 --> 01:25:14.385]  We're coming in!
[01:25:14.765 --> 01:25:15.846]  Hillary's going down!
[01:25:16.366 --> 01:25:19.268]  The head of the DNC's saying she stole the election, she killed people!
[01:25:19.468 --> 01:25:20.328]  It's all coming out!
[01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:27.472]  And all you whores in media that take the globalist money to sell the country out, your names are gonna be anathema!
[01:25:27.692 --> 01:25:28.733]  They're gonna be mud!
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:32.520]  Here's another one.
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:35.181]  Saudi Arabia intercepts ballistic missile over capital.
[01:25:35.221 --> 01:25:38.442]  That was used as a diversion that hit outside the airport.
[01:25:38.782 --> 01:25:39.682]  Fired from Yemen.
[01:25:40.642 --> 01:25:45.784]  Remember, Trump urges Saudi Arabia to list state oil company on New York Stock Exchange.
[01:25:46.164 --> 01:25:49.144]  But a group of anti-American globalists tried to block it.
[01:25:50.725 --> 01:25:52.145]  Tried to block Trump's deal.
[01:25:54.286 --> 01:25:55.186]  And so what happened?
[01:25:55.266 --> 01:25:56.486]  Oh, they're all been arrested.
[01:25:57.867 --> 01:25:58.827]  See how that works, scum?
[01:26:00.914 --> 01:26:01.775]  Oh, but don't worry.
[01:26:01.835 --> 01:26:04.136]  We've seen George Herbert Walker Bush.
[01:26:05.016 --> 01:26:10.559]  Now, eight women have come forward saying he grabbed them, grabbed their butts, tried to rape them from his wheelchair.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:15.162]  He's now come out with his son and said that Trump's a blowhard.
[01:26:15.482 --> 01:26:17.523]  Let me tell you who sold out America to Saudi Arabia.
[01:26:17.823 --> 01:26:18.283]  The Bushes.
[01:26:18.644 --> 01:26:19.204]  The globalists.
[01:26:19.544 --> 01:26:20.304]  Back in the 70s.
[01:26:21.045 --> 01:26:23.826]  And now they are being put in line.
[01:26:23.846 --> 01:26:26.047]  I mean, look at George W. Jr.
[01:26:27.168 --> 01:26:28.249]  With his dad?
[01:26:28.789 --> 01:26:49.784]  I mean, talk about two bombed-out-of-their-brain lunatics who think them coming out against Trump now, when they'd sold us out all these foreign interests, these corrupt, twisted lunatics that sold us out to the Nazis and are lucky that Prescott Bush, Herbert Walker Bush's dad, wasn't arrested during the McCormick-Dickstein committee hearings.
[01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:51.285]  You people are jokes!
[01:26:52.846 --> 01:26:54.087]  So that's what this comes down to.
[01:26:54.187 --> 01:26:56.309]  And now the rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[01:26:57.395 --> 01:27:01.358]  Even the Huffington Post says Hillary Clinton, the Podesta group, and the Saudi regime.
[01:27:01.739 --> 01:27:06.082]  And now they're admitting they're on the payroll of the corrupt elements of the Saudi regime.
[01:27:06.502 --> 01:27:10.445]  And Podesta's getting in trouble for Uranium One and everything else.
[01:27:11.106 --> 01:27:14.128]  It's all coming back to haunt them.
[01:27:14.148 --> 01:27:17.051]  We told you Seth Rich was a political assassination.
[01:27:17.091 --> 01:27:17.811]  Nothing was taken.
[01:27:18.132 --> 01:27:19.793]  Now the head of the DNC says it was.
[01:27:20.153 --> 01:27:21.815]  We told you all this stuff.
[01:27:21.855 --> 01:27:24.657]  And every day it's all coming out.
[01:27:25.933 --> 01:27:29.414]  And we told you they were planning a violent revolution tomorrow that would probably be a dud.
[01:27:29.654 --> 01:27:30.334]  And it was.
[01:27:30.354 --> 01:27:34.475]  We're going to cover that with Ellen Schreuer coming up in the next segment.
[01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:37.155]  They think they're going to drive us out of power?
[01:27:37.556 --> 01:27:38.496]  We don't want power.
[01:27:38.516 --> 01:27:43.897]  We want free market to be left alone and to have low taxes and to be able to have the American Dream again.
[01:27:44.177 --> 01:27:48.118]  And the world wants that dream because it's a reality and it's happening.
[01:27:48.438 --> 01:27:48.778]  Briefly.

[01:28:41.254 --> 01:28:48.503]  Because despite all the censorship, we're winning thanks to you all and this amazing crew that worked so hard up here on Sunday.
[01:28:48.763 --> 01:28:56.813]  That said, Owen Schroer and more is coming up on the revolution that didn't happen, that was a dud that Soros funded yesterday.
[01:28:57.154 --> 01:28:57.935]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:28:57.995 --> 01:28:58.475]  Stay with us.
[01:29:03.248 --> 01:29:13.056]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[01:29:13.896 --> 01:29:23.263]  And today we see the leftist, the globalist, controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[01:29:23.664 --> 01:29:26.626]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[01:29:27.226 --> 01:29:36.915]  Clothing is a statement, and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud, just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[01:29:37.375 --> 01:29:42.579]  So right now, folks, we're gonna debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the InfoWars store.
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:45.362]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[01:29:45.423 --> 01:29:46.364]  It's a limited edition.
[01:29:46.924 --> 01:29:48.926]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[01:29:49.167 --> 01:29:55.874]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[01:29:56.215 --> 01:30:00.419]  On the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:02.141]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows
[01:30:02.862 --> 01:30:08.224]  That organizations like CNN are owned by foreign multinational corporations, hell-bent on enslaving this country.
[01:30:08.504 --> 01:30:17.326]  So when you expose them as fake news, you're doing your patriotic duty, and you're exercising your First Amendment in defiance of their bullying, garbage, and tyranny.
[01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:21.887]  And on the back, Infowars.com is the standard of real news.
[01:30:22.408 --> 01:30:23.488]  And of course, this classic?
[01:30:24.208 --> 01:30:24.808]  Says it all.
[01:30:24.908 --> 01:30:25.789]  Need I say more?
[01:30:26.289 --> 01:30:27.909]  You want to have a political message out there?
[01:30:27.929 --> 01:30:33.711]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[01:30:34.032 --> 01:30:37.113]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[01:30:37.553 --> 01:30:43.135]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[01:30:43.875 --> 01:30:46.196]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[01:30:46.517 --> 01:30:54.901]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[01:30:55.162 --> 01:30:58.744]  And this shirt, The Spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[01:30:59.564 --> 01:31:09.035]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Labe or Come and Take It in good old-fashioned English t-shirts.
[01:31:09.195 --> 01:31:11.678]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[01:31:12.059 --> 01:31:13.680]  InfoWars.com to spread the word.
[01:31:14.421 --> 01:31:15.521]  I designed this baby.
[01:31:15.601 --> 01:31:18.022]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[01:31:18.402 --> 01:31:22.664]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:26.845]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[01:31:27.305 --> 01:31:30.026]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[01:31:30.046 --> 01:31:31.406]  It's been around about 19 years.
[01:31:32.026 --> 01:31:35.627]  It's the classic InfoWars tyranny response team shirt.
[01:31:35.908 --> 01:31:43.450]  And of course, we've seen the NFL taking a knee during the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[01:31:44.230 --> 01:31:45.110]  That's disrespectful.
[01:31:45.150 --> 01:31:49.152]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[01:31:49.212 --> 01:31:56.676]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[01:31:57.076 --> 01:31:58.536]  Our republic is in distress.
[01:31:58.997 --> 01:31:59.437]  Ask me why.
[01:32:00.137 --> 01:32:02.059]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[01:32:02.199 --> 01:32:07.744]  Good old camouflage with the Dayglo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[01:32:08.185 --> 01:32:09.686]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[01:32:09.746 --> 01:32:12.709]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go out and put another shirt on.
[01:32:13.170 --> 01:32:15.332]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[01:32:15.952 --> 01:32:18.215]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[01:32:18.895 --> 01:32:19.676]  It's all about freedom.
[01:32:19.716 --> 01:32:21.057]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[01:32:21.578 --> 01:32:22.499]  Resist Tyranny.
[01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:24.141]  Made in America.
[01:32:24.161 --> 01:32:24.141]  1776.
[01:32:24.781 --> 01:32:27.864]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[01:32:28.085 --> 01:32:29.046]  The backs are really cool.
[01:32:29.406 --> 01:32:30.067]  Look at that back.
[01:32:30.127 --> 01:32:31.048]  That's pure Americana.
[01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:37.412]  And I almost forgot, we've got dozens and dozens of great limited-edition ball caps available.
[01:32:37.532 --> 01:32:38.233]  The Dayglo.
[01:32:38.733 --> 01:32:42.815]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[01:32:42.975 --> 01:32:44.596]  This is my favorite ball cap.
[01:32:44.976 --> 01:32:46.296]  Over 20 ball caps we put out.
[01:32:46.536 --> 01:32:47.577]  It's got the nice patch.
[01:32:47.917 --> 01:32:48.958]  Infowars.com.
[01:32:49.198 --> 01:32:50.078]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[01:32:50.338 --> 01:32:53.760]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:55.761]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[01:32:56.021 --> 01:33:00.503]  Thank you all for your support, and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:33:05.271 --> 01:33:07.952]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.977 --> 01:33:18.158]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:18.678 --> 01:33:23.801]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:27.395 --> 01:33:29.117]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show here.
[01:33:29.458 --> 01:33:30.900]  Filling in for Alex Owen-Schroyer.
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:33.763]  We'll be with you until 6 p.m.
[01:33:33.823 --> 01:33:36.166]  Central as we are every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:36.186 --> 01:33:36.386]  Central.
[01:33:38.687 --> 01:33:42.708]  InfoWars kicks off their weekday broadcasting tomorrow morning 8 a.m.
[01:33:42.908 --> 01:33:44.089]  Real News with David Knight.
[01:33:44.449 --> 01:33:53.091]  Four hours of the Alex Jones Show as always 11 to 3 and then followed up by The War Room hosted by yours truly from 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:53.131 --> 01:33:53.512]  Central.
[01:33:53.552 --> 01:33:56.072]  That is our live weekday schedule now.
[01:33:56.573 --> 01:33:57.693]  Thanks to you supporting us.
[01:33:58.353 --> 01:34:04.455]  All right, we've got some details coming through the pipeline now on the shooter.
[01:34:06.329 --> 01:34:12.754]  In Sutherland Springs, Texas today, who killed reportedly 27 people.
[01:34:12.814 --> 01:34:17.057]  We're hearing different numbers, but the highest would be 27, the lowest 20.
[01:34:18.459 --> 01:34:20.360]  Devin Patrick Kelly.
[01:34:21.761 --> 01:34:26.925]  Devin Patrick Kelly is the one who's been ID'd as the shooter.
[01:34:28.666 --> 01:34:30.048]  And how do you like this, folks?
[01:34:32.309 --> 01:34:34.151]  An Air Force veteran.
[01:34:35.979 --> 01:34:49.482]  And a gun owner who posted on October 29th a picture of his rifle with the caption, she's a bad bitch.
[01:34:52.483 --> 01:34:58.485]  Well, that's going to feed right into the Democrats' hands, so we can already see the narrative that's going to play out here, folks.
[01:34:59.805 --> 01:35:01.945]  No need to pontificate on that.
[01:35:02.085 --> 01:35:03.906]  We already know where this one's going.
[01:35:07.054 --> 01:35:09.635]  So, this is what we have.
[01:35:11.236 --> 01:35:33.165]  This morning, just after 11 a.m., we're told that Devin Patrick Kelly, a 26-year-old who lived just outside of San Antonio, went into a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs and killed at least 20 people, injured 50.
[01:35:35.089 --> 01:35:39.532]  Sadly no one at the church was armed at the time and he met zero resistance.
[01:35:40.892 --> 01:35:47.536]  He then fled the scene and we're told was then apprehended about five blocks from the church.
[01:35:48.197 --> 01:35:54.641]  We do not know yet whether he died from a self-inflicted bullet wound or one from the police.
[01:35:55.461 --> 01:35:58.323]  That is really the lone detail that we don't have.
[01:35:59.850 --> 01:36:07.439]  Every other piece of the story, all the other puzzle pieces have already been laid out there for us and for the media to report on.
[01:36:08.732 --> 01:36:11.653]  We are still waiting for the press conference to go live.
[01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:17.314]  I would suspect that's going to be coming down here soon now that they have ID'd and released the name of the killer.
[01:36:17.874 --> 01:36:28.436]  Rob Dew is live on the scene right now at the press conference as we wait for official statements from the police or from the FBI.
[01:36:28.716 --> 01:36:35.858]  We know the FBI is on the scene as well, so it'll be interesting to see who controls the press conference there.
[01:36:37.196 --> 01:36:54.950]  But again, Devin Patrick Kelly, an Air Force veteran, and somebody who had a gun as his background, and apparently it was his rifle that he posted about.
[01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:56.951]  I guess this is on Facebook here.
[01:37:01.114 --> 01:37:06.819]  So... There you go, folks.
[01:37:09.031 --> 01:37:09.471]  So great.
[01:37:12.192 --> 01:37:13.752]  Well, you already know what's going to happen tomorrow.
[01:37:13.772 --> 01:37:17.113]  It's the white male's fault.
[01:37:19.034 --> 01:37:19.994]  And it's the gun's fault.
[01:37:21.574 --> 01:37:28.096]  Just like the Austin Chronicle said, white males are the new face of terror.
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:35.123]  Now we have not been provided a motive in the Las Vegas massacre.
[01:37:36.965 --> 01:37:39.226]  You can guess your own reasons as to why that is.
[01:37:40.527 --> 01:37:45.291]  I wonder if and when we'll ever get a motive on this deal.
[01:37:46.532 --> 01:37:59.782]  I wonder what type of... Well let's just say it'll be interesting to see what goes on in the interwebs on the forums such as 4chan and Reddit as we continue to get more details on this.
[01:38:02.298 --> 01:38:11.561]  It'll be interesting to see what comes of any video footage that may have been recorded of the congregation that day.
[01:38:11.581 --> 01:38:17.843]  This is a church, a congregation, that records all of their Sundays.
[01:38:19.144 --> 01:38:22.025]  And it looks like the press conference now is about to begin, folks.
[01:38:22.085 --> 01:38:26.546]  It looks like Greg Abbott is going to be leading us off here.
[01:38:27.407 --> 01:38:28.107]  Greg Abbott.
[01:38:29.338 --> 01:38:35.420]  About to speak from a community center just outside of Sutherland Springs.
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:36.961]  Our own Rob Dew is on the scene.
[01:38:37.581 --> 01:38:39.362]  Let's go live to the press conference.
[01:38:40.082 --> 01:38:48.565]  For pitching in and helping out and continuing to demonstrate to the entire world the way that Texans come together to help their fellow Texans.
[01:38:50.425 --> 01:38:57.368]  As a state, we are dealing with the largest mass shooting in our state's history.
[01:38:59.073 --> 01:39:02.417]  There's so many families who've lost family members.
[01:39:04.259 --> 01:39:06.141]  Fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters.
[01:39:07.542 --> 01:39:15.411]  The tragedy, of course, is worsened by the fact that it occurred in a church, a place of worship, where these people were innocently gunned down.
[01:39:17.313 --> 01:39:21.117]  We mourn their loss, but we support their family members.
[01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:36.135]  In their efforts as they put all the pieces of a very complex puzzle together to try to provide their community all the answers they need and deserve.
[01:39:37.856 --> 01:39:47.724]  Unfortunately, I'm sad to tell you to confirm, at least at this moment in time, there are 26 lives that have been lost.
[01:39:49.366 --> 01:39:51.628]  We don't know if that number will rise or not.
[01:39:51.668 --> 01:39:53.430]  All we know is that's too many.
[01:39:54.751 --> 01:40:00.696]  And this will be a long-suffering morning for those in pain.
[01:40:02.838 --> 01:40:12.808]  We ask for God's comfort, for God's guidance, and for God's healing for all those who are suffering.
[01:40:13.582 --> 01:40:20.625]  This is the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, reporting from the press conference.
[01:40:20.645 --> 01:40:27.168]  You put your arm around your kid and give your kid a big hug and let them know how much you love them.
[01:40:29.369 --> 01:40:31.870]  Knowing that we support each other.
[01:40:33.191 --> 01:40:38.033]  Tell your friend and your neighbor that you support them and that you will work with them.
[01:40:40.214 --> 01:41:05.314]  I'm very proud of the way that we have so many people working together to respond to this already and talking to the emergency team in Texas reported that the emergency medical task force from San Antonio was deployed to help respond to the magnitude of this tragedy.
[01:41:06.528 --> 01:41:15.432]  San Antonio Area Hospitals and Trauma Centers have coordinated with regard to patient movement and patient care.
[01:41:16.833 --> 01:41:23.756]  The Red Cross has set up Family Assistance Center to help all families affected by this.
[01:41:25.357 --> 01:41:27.338]  One thing that is very important for
[01:41:28.749 --> 01:41:42.358]  Everybody affected by this, whether you're a family member or non-family member, is that you avail yourself of counseling resources that will be made readily available in abundance.
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:51.885]  Now we have so many people who have helped respond in a coordinated fashion already.
[01:41:53.177 --> 01:41:57.641]  I want to express my gratitude to the President, who called from overseas.
[01:41:58.721 --> 01:42:06.708]  My gratitude to Senators Cornyn and Cruz, with whom I've already spoken, as well as members of the Texas Legislature.
[01:42:07.833 --> 01:42:20.249]  But when you look at the robust response from just the immediate area, I want to express my gratitude to the Sheriff of Wilson County, to the District Attorney from this area, Audrey Lewis.
[01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:24.375]  The reason I say this area is because her territory is larger than just Wilson County.
[01:42:27.438 --> 01:42:33.345]  Alright folks, we've got to go to a break here.
[01:42:33.385 --> 01:42:35.847]  We've got one more segment left of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:35.867 --> 01:42:40.352]  You were just hearing from Greg Abbott at the beginning of this press conference.
[01:42:40.633 --> 01:42:41.514]  26 lives lost.
[01:42:43.835 --> 01:42:45.597]  Devin Kelly, a former U.S.
[01:42:45.717 --> 01:42:56.346]  Air Force member, served from 2010 to 2014 dishonorably discharged, and he used an AR-15 rifle, they are reporting, for this mass shooting.
[01:42:56.386 --> 01:42:59.188]  We'll continue to cover this as more details emerge.
[01:42:59.228 --> 01:42:59.749]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:43:03.467 --> 01:43:07.531]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[01:44:31.391 --> 01:44:31.531]  Woo!
[01:44:31.591 --> 01:44:32.512]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:44:32.632 --> 01:44:41.237]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:44:41.377 --> 01:44:50.583]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:44:50.963 --> 01:44:54.285]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:44:54.405 --> 01:44:58.367]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.

[01:45:05.811 --> 01:45:10.113]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:45:10.773 --> 01:45:12.033]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[01:45:13.054 --> 01:45:17.676]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:45:17.696 --> 01:45:19.637]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[01:45:20.037 --> 01:45:21.618]  B vitamins we need every day.
[01:45:21.818 --> 01:45:26.900]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:28.701]  O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[01:45:29.421 --> 01:45:34.505]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[01:45:35.045 --> 01:45:35.405]  Secret 12.
[01:45:36.886 --> 01:45:37.767]  Optimal absorption.
[01:45:38.047 --> 01:45:42.750]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[01:45:43.191 --> 01:45:47.373]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[01:45:48.314 --> 01:45:49.115]  Optimum levels.
[01:45:50.536 --> 01:45:54.342]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.

[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:06.742]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:46:07.103 --> 01:46:14.207]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:46:14.828 --> 01:46:23.153]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:46:23.433 --> 01:46:27.556]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:46:27.876 --> 01:46:33.200]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:37.281]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:46:37.682 --> 01:46:40.783]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:46:41.103 --> 01:46:52.187]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:46:52.227 --> 01:46:54.928]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[01:46:55.148 --> 01:47:01.110]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:08.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:19.648 --> 01:47:24.651]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:27.273]  You're listening to Alex Jones!
[01:47:28.943 --> 01:47:38.967]  Fulch, right now the press conference is live and they're now reporting it was a citizen with a gun that may have actually saved lives and stopped the shooting before it got worse.
[01:47:38.987 --> 01:47:41.048]  Let's go live to the press conference.
[01:47:41.609 --> 01:47:42.869]  We know he's deceased in the vehicle.
[01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:46.311]  The suspect has not been completely identified.
[01:47:46.871 --> 01:47:50.192]  We believe he's a young white male, maybe in his early 20s.
[01:47:50.292 --> 01:47:56.515]  He was dressed in all black tactical type gear and was wearing a ballistic vest.
[01:47:58.237 --> 01:48:08.040]  The delay in getting him identified is there were multiple weapons in the vehicle and the vehicle has been processed by our Texas Ranger Special Operations Group bomb techs.
[01:48:09.661 --> 01:48:12.222]  There's a lot of work to be done in this investigation.
[01:48:12.402 --> 01:48:13.122]  We know that there are
[01:48:15.062 --> 01:48:22.026]  23 found deceased inside the church, two deceased outside the church, and now one of them that was transported that was injured has deceased.
[01:48:23.287 --> 01:48:24.368]  Bringing the total to 26.
[01:48:25.228 --> 01:48:35.194]  We have approximately 20 that are transported local and in hospitals in San Antonio with injuries that vary from minor to very severe.
[01:48:35.954 --> 01:48:39.997]  We know the ages range from 5 years old to 72 years of age.
[01:48:42.478 --> 01:48:43.659]  There's a lot of work to be done.
[01:48:45.057 --> 01:48:50.599]  We are only hours into this investigation, which is going to take a significant length of time.
[01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:54.041]  We will continue to provide information as it becomes available.
[01:48:54.541 --> 01:48:56.022]  We know you're going to have a lot of questions.
[01:48:56.082 --> 01:48:57.742]  There are many, many that we cannot answer.
[01:48:58.663 --> 01:49:00.243]  We continue to process crime scenes.
[01:49:00.283 --> 01:49:02.144]  We have multiple, multiple crime scenes.
[01:49:02.184 --> 01:49:02.885]  We have the church.
[01:49:02.945 --> 01:49:04.025]  We have outside the church.
[01:49:04.185 --> 01:49:06.186]  We have where the suspect's vehicle was located.
[01:49:06.886 --> 01:49:11.248]  We have following up on the suspect and where he's from, his residence.
[01:49:11.388 --> 01:49:12.989]  We have many, many people to interview.
[01:49:13.809 --> 01:49:19.573]  We have Texas Rangers at all the hospitals, locating those and interviewing those who were injured.
[01:49:20.294 --> 01:49:25.938]  So, not a lot of information to give at this time, but the state of Texas, we have every resource that we have available.
[01:49:25.998 --> 01:49:33.964]  Texas Rangers, Special Operations, Texas Highway Patrol, Crime Scene Labs, Victim Services, the Texas Division of Emergency Management.
[01:49:34.625 --> 01:49:37.026]  Every resource we have available is working.
[01:49:37.467 --> 01:49:42.811]  And at the end of this investigation, we'll be able to answer any reasonable question as to what happened.
[01:49:43.391 --> 01:49:44.352]  Was the neighbor injured?
[01:49:45.033 --> 01:49:46.215]  The one that engaged gunfire?
[01:49:46.275 --> 01:49:46.815]  No, he was not.
[01:49:46.835 --> 01:49:48.958]  Is that correct?
[01:49:50.487 --> 01:50:02.055]  So interesting, they're reporting that it was a neighbor that heard the gunshots that came out and with his own rifle and may have stopped the shooting from getting worse as they just reported that the shooter had other weapons in his vehicles.
[01:50:02.095 --> 01:50:03.095]  Let's go to Greg Abbott now.
[01:50:20.587 --> 01:50:28.211]  How many were in the church and how many escaped death or being wounded?
[01:50:28.491 --> 01:50:36.174]  If we don't have those numbers, there were people in the church that escaped that were not injured, but we don't have all that information.
[01:50:36.414 --> 01:50:38.235]  Was Vastin held at the time?
[01:50:39.156 --> 01:50:43.858]  So they're now saying that there were eyewitnesses of the shooting inside the church that they believe escaped without harm.
[01:50:46.135 --> 01:50:46.995]  Not at this time.
[01:50:47.356 --> 01:50:51.377]  That is being investigated, but we can't say one way or the other.
[01:50:51.958 --> 01:50:56.660]  What about him was suspicious to begin with, or what initiated the original call?
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:03.542]  Those are the types of things that are under intense investigation right now, and hopefully we will learn about them in the next 24 hours.
[01:51:03.823 --> 01:51:08.285]  The revised total of victims, that does not include the shooter, correct?
[01:51:08.305 --> 01:51:08.445]  Correct.
[01:51:08.465 --> 01:51:11.606]  Can you tell us anything about a possible raid at the suspect's home?
[01:51:13.406 --> 01:51:21.873]  All of those types of things will be pieces of information that will be coming out shortly.
[01:51:21.933 --> 01:51:22.293]  Interesting.
[01:51:22.413 --> 01:51:26.437]  Victims outside the church.
[01:51:26.777 --> 01:51:29.399]  All of those types of things are being looked into as we speak.
[01:51:29.519 --> 01:51:30.420]  Did I say Russian?
[01:51:33.682 --> 01:51:36.505]  Say again?
[01:51:39.108 --> 01:51:40.510]  Unaware of that.
[01:51:41.190 --> 01:51:42.892]  As soon as possible.
[01:51:43.393 --> 01:51:44.634]  So this is interesting.
[01:51:44.654 --> 01:51:49.620]  We've had a name released, Devin Patrick Kelly, but in this press conference they're not willing to commit to that.
[01:51:51.941 --> 01:51:54.663]  I think you're realizing that there's a lot of information.
[01:51:55.003 --> 01:52:07.330]  We want to piece the puzzle together before we provide you any misinformation and we want to make sure that we meet with the family members who are affected by this before we release information publicly.
[01:52:08.011 --> 01:52:10.232]  We hope to get this information to you as soon as possible.
[01:52:10.552 --> 01:52:11.193]  Thank y'all very much.
[01:52:12.469 --> 01:52:15.291]  And the call that came in was an active shooter.
[01:52:15.751 --> 01:52:18.173]  There was no calls that came in.
[01:52:18.193 --> 01:52:21.295]  Okay, so that concludes the press conference from Stockdale, Texas.
[01:52:21.355 --> 01:52:22.435]  Our own Rob Dew was there.
[01:52:22.475 --> 01:52:24.076]  He had the whole thing if you want to go back and watch it.
[01:52:25.757 --> 01:52:27.018]  Let's take a couple interesting notes.
[01:52:27.438 --> 01:52:34.803]  Now we're about to have the clip of the eyewitness that said the neighbor came out and may have thwarted the shooting from being worse.
[01:52:36.324 --> 01:52:37.905]  That was confirmed in the press conference.
[01:52:38.565 --> 01:52:39.766]  They said 26 dead.
[01:52:39.806 --> 01:52:41.327]  That was from Governor Abbott.
[01:52:42.478 --> 01:53:06.958]  Interestingly enough, it sounded like, and again, I just heard this for the first time, and crew, if you guys heard something different than what I heard, please enlighten me, but it sounded like the one guy described the event that the shooter actually began outside of the church, and that he was, I don't know if he was shooting into the church or shooting people out, but it sounded, the description to me said that the shooter started outside the church,
[01:53:07.867 --> 01:53:08.408]  We're good to go.
[01:53:22.882 --> 01:53:50.062]  in fire with him and I guess that's when he hopped in the car and tried to flee the scene and then was apprehended about five blocks later where they said he had more weapons in his vehicle now on that same note they were unwilling to commit to Devin Patrick Kelly as the shooter even though he's the one being reported as the shooter already by most mainstream media outlets
[01:53:51.124 --> 01:53:59.606]  And again, this Devin Patrick Kelly was dishonorably discharged after serving in the Air Force from 2010 to 2014.
[01:54:00.046 --> 01:54:13.750]  He did post on social media pictures of his rifle that they're saying he used, and then the Facebook page of Devin Patrick Kelly, of course, magically gone right after his name is released.
[01:54:13.890 --> 01:54:16.751]  So it's amazing how that happens.
[01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:19.351]  So let's go to this clip now.
[01:54:19.411 --> 01:54:26.415]  This is an eyewitness to the neighbor coming out and potentially thwarting this shooting from getting worse.
[01:54:27.956 --> 01:54:28.017]  Wow.
[01:54:46.576 --> 01:54:53.822]  Okay, so according to that eyewitness, the neighbor came out, engaged the shooter, the killer,
[01:54:55.006 --> 01:55:08.811]  She believes that a bullet struck the shooter at that point in time, in which case the shooter then got into his vehicle and fled the scene only to crash it a few blocks down the road.
[01:55:09.431 --> 01:55:15.693]  Is that a crash because he was so disoriented, lost vision or lost consciousness because of blood loss?
[01:55:16.113 --> 01:55:18.814]  Was there another factor that caused that accident?
[01:55:19.595 --> 01:55:23.356]  Did he decide he just wanted to kill himself at that point because he had already been shot?
[01:55:24.276 --> 01:55:26.418]  I guess we may or may not get those answers.
[01:55:28.759 --> 01:55:29.880]  But think about this, folks.
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:30.760]  Think about this.
[01:55:32.961 --> 01:55:43.488]  On the heels of this attack, you already had multiple Democrats from Congress blaming the gun, calling for gun legislation.
[01:55:43.708 --> 01:55:46.089]  But think about this as we're learning more of this event.
[01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:53.374]  If it wasn't for an American citizen with a gun, according to eyewitnesses and their testimonies,
[01:55:54.608 --> 01:55:56.629]  This shooting could have been worse.
[01:55:58.450 --> 01:56:02.352]  Folks, police officers are not on the scene all the time.
[01:56:02.432 --> 01:56:03.752]  They simply cannot be.
[01:56:03.913 --> 01:56:04.813]  It's impossible.
[01:56:05.974 --> 01:56:09.895]  The average response time for police, I think, is around two minutes.
[01:56:10.856 --> 01:56:11.176]  Okay?
[01:56:12.377 --> 01:56:13.477]  I'm not knocking the police.
[01:56:13.617 --> 01:56:14.418]  They're only human.
[01:56:14.978 --> 01:56:16.339]  They can't be everywhere at once.
[01:56:17.099 --> 01:56:18.660]  If it wasn't for a good citizen,
[01:56:19.835 --> 01:56:33.120]  A neighbor that heard the shooting and pulled out his own rifle and eyewitnesses believe that it was the neighbor that shot the suspect and eventually led to the stopping of this mass shooting.
[01:56:35.701 --> 01:56:39.683]  That is pretty powerful to think that this was, and this is Texas, of course.
[01:56:39.983 --> 01:56:40.864]  This has happened before.
[01:56:41.264 --> 01:56:44.325]  Islamic terrorists have been shot dead before they can carry out a mass event.
[01:56:45.862 --> 01:56:56.953]  So, while all the Democrats are calling for guns to be taken, calling for gun control, blaming guns, blaming the Second Amendment, recall what stopped this shooter, according to eyewitnesses.
[01:56:57.674 --> 01:56:59.415]  A good guy with a gun.
[01:56:59.856 --> 01:57:01.317]  A citizen with a gun.
[01:57:01.457 --> 01:57:10.286]  A rifle that the Democrats would probably love to take from that citizen that stopped the shooting because they think that's the answer to ending all this.
[01:57:12.119 --> 01:57:14.460]  So, folks, obviously stay tuned.
[01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:16.421]  Info Wars will be on top of this.

[01:57:37.732 --> 01:57:39.373]  They're rumoring the other one might be Flynn.
[01:57:39.754 --> 01:57:40.474]  We'll see about that.
[01:57:40.574 --> 01:57:44.577]  Trump is expecting to meet with Vladimir Putin on his trip to Asia.
[01:57:45.258 --> 01:57:46.018]  Unbelievable, folks.
