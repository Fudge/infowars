[00:00:18.144 --> 00:00:19.846]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:21.508]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.508 --> 00:00:36.243]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:38.165]  Thursday, the ninth day of November 2017, we're now
[00:00:44.597 --> 00:00:52.701]  Close to 30 hours in to the worldwide broadcast that we launched yesterday morning at 8 a.m.
[00:00:52.701 --> 00:01:02.285]  I'm gonna be here for the next four hours and we've got Owen Schroer who will complete the 34-hour global transmission and then Lord willing we'll be back tomorrow 8 a.m.
[00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:07.888]  with a kickoff of Real News with David Knight and of course InfoWars Live with yours truly Alex Jones.
[00:01:10.913 --> 00:01:27.237]  About a month ago, the Huffington Post attacked me for saying that in Hollywood, they have lesbian groups that pose as feminist organizations to lure young women into them and that the women are basically kept slaves.
[00:01:27.237 --> 00:01:29.477]  And they said this was a horrible, vile thing.
[00:01:29.477 --> 00:01:35.739]  The headline was, Alex Jones, Harvey Weinstein comments are vile beyond belief.
[00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:40.300]  Well, I mean, I read the police reports that get swept under the rug, and I have sources around the world.
[00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:45.439]  And movies like Hostel are real.
[00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:54.446]  They're basically documentaries in film format.
[00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:57.729]  Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, all that kind of stuff, that's what's going on.
[00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.533]  A lot of rich people's houses down in basements.
[00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:08.617]  There are millions and millions of missing people every year in every major country and they say, oh, they're runaways or they changed their identity.
[00:02:08.617 --> 00:02:09.718]  Yeah, maybe 60% or so it turns out.
[00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:19.980]  But the tens of millions that never get found, folks, go into acid baths.
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.763]  Now that's what I talked about.
[00:02:23.763 --> 00:02:31.427]  Well, when you study this, there's a lot of other groups that kind of mimic it, but they don't do the killing part.
[00:02:31.427 --> 00:02:35.109]  Because they know a lot of people want to be in a cult-type situation.
[00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.071]  There's that area in the human mind.
[00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:38.351]  And so,
[00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:57.570]  You're starting to hear more and more about this coming out, where there'll be gyms, where people work out that also have a sex cult angle to them, and where everybody's shaman, and, you know, take drugs to open up their consciousness, and that's going on all over the world.
[00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:07.534]  And so it's shades of gray into where all that goes, but usually you'll find an intelligence agency spinoff group
[00:03:08.442 --> 00:03:17.931]  That is basically running mind control operations through those organizations.
[00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:28.781]  Because people in sociopathic mindsets and psychopathic mindsets crave control over others.
[00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:29.601]  The big Nazi
[00:03:31.368 --> 00:03:36.092]  rallies at night, the torches, and everyone marching in formation in North Korea.
[00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:37.393]  It's the same thing.
[00:03:37.393 --> 00:03:44.278]  It's those psychopaths and sociopaths that crave that, and they're always trying to build it.
[00:03:44.278 --> 00:03:50.323]  And then they hate any other thought system that isn't centralized.
[00:03:50.323 --> 00:03:53.066]  And they wage war against it.
[00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:57.009]  And that's why there's war against Christianity.
[00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.732]  It's an admitted war against Christianity that's going on.
[00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:19.734]  Is because for bad or worse, there are a lot of bad permutations of Christianity, man-made control systems and cults, but the overall operating system of it and the spirit of it is not compatible with the kingdom of the cults, New World Order model.
[00:04:19.734 --> 00:04:22.896]  Now, you suddenly see it all over the news, from LA to New York.
[00:04:23.948 --> 00:04:29.891]  Feminist cults where women are slaves and then a man runs it.
[00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:34.974]  Finally the doors swing open and there's Dracula.
[00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:39.497]  But he sends his women out to recruit other women.
[00:04:39.497 --> 00:04:44.579]  And you've got this NXIVM group up in New York.
[00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:47.541]  This is the child's play organization.
[00:04:47.541 --> 00:04:50.423]  It's a pretend group of some of the real ones that are out there.
[00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:52.204]  But we're going to tell you about it when we come back.
[00:04:52.204 --> 00:04:52.644]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.925 --> 00:05:02.686]  My fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with a very important message.
[00:05:02.686 --> 00:05:07.888]  Secret 12, 40% off the best vitamin B12 out there from our research.
[00:05:07.888 --> 00:05:09.109]  Can't get it under the tongue.
[00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:10.069]  Simply amazing.
[00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:11.730]  That sale is continuing.
[00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.051]  Super Mel Vitality for stamina, libido, energy.
[00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:16.091]  That's 30% off.
[00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:17.212]  That's continuing.
[00:05:17.212 --> 00:05:28.116]  And the other really, really good news is that, yes, we're having to end the sale of 50% off on Anthroplex, but DNA Force, after almost four months, out of stock, is back in stock.
[00:05:28.976 --> 00:05:30.938]  25% off our flagship product.
[00:05:30.938 --> 00:05:35.781]  Also, Biome Defense, the great probiotic, that is 25% off as well.
[00:05:35.781 --> 00:05:40.184]  So a lot of things are selling out, and a lot of things are still at record sales.
[00:05:40.184 --> 00:05:44.467]  Like Silver Bullet, super high quality colloidal silver is still 50% off.
[00:05:44.467 --> 00:05:48.590]  And there's other sales that are still going, but they're all about to end.
[00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:55.054]  Whether it's DNA Force, or whether it's Silver Bullet, it's all available right now at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:34.830]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.216]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:06:39.641 --> 00:06:51.904]  We are now 27 hours into the global 34-hour marathon transmission celebrating the one-year anniversary that has now came and gone of the election of Donald John Trump.
[00:06:51.904 --> 00:06:58.686]  We're going to look at how they're trying to spin two blue states going blue again as the end of populism worldwide.
[00:06:59.446 --> 00:07:02.508]  Yes, rumors of our demise has been greatly exaggerated.
[00:07:02.508 --> 00:07:09.091]  We've got new big breaking news saying exactly what I told you on air five years ago and a month ago.
[00:07:09.091 --> 00:07:18.656]  I even have the Huffington Post attacking me, saying that there are feminist groups that really lure women into dungeons and enslave them for men.
[00:07:18.656 --> 00:07:22.518]  And it's all over the news today!
[00:07:22.518 --> 00:07:23.339]  How interesting!
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:42.778]  Inside the terrifying slave cult, where women, including a Hollywood actress, are forced to hand over naked pictures, get branded with the founder's initials, and are beaten with paddles, and forced to recruit other women as, quote, slaves.
[00:07:42.778 --> 00:07:48.244]  And they first get into it as a women's empowerment, women-only feminist organization.
[00:07:51.573 --> 00:07:56.315]  Yeah, there are a lot of lesbian women that want their own harems.
[00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:59.956]  And I don't attack lesbians, I understand they've got good taste.
[00:07:59.956 --> 00:08:07.199]  The point is, is that they don't get to engage in any behavior they want, because they're quote, the protected class.
[00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:18.324]  And I told you, behind every lesbian cult, there is a Count Dracula in the shadows.
[00:08:18.324 --> 00:08:21.005]  And that's exactly what all these articles coming out say.
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:32.103]  The feminist sex cult that women thought was women empowerment.
[00:08:32.103 --> 00:08:41.067]  And then they find out, oh, we serve the man, you call him master.
[00:08:41.067 --> 00:08:48.709]  And Hollywood and Fifty Shades of Grey is all just a primer to get you in those handcuffs the first couple times.
[00:08:48.709 --> 00:08:49.510]  And sometimes,
[00:08:50.714 --> 00:08:56.218]  Like I said, a month ago and got attacked by George Soros' outfit.
[00:08:56.218 --> 00:08:58.640]  He originally funded Arianna Huffington.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.784]  And like, you don't expel the girls.
[00:09:02.784 --> 00:09:07.227]  You don't tell the girls it's not sexy to go in those dungeons.
[00:09:07.227 --> 00:09:15.714]  You don't touch our favorite thing!
[00:09:15.714 --> 00:09:17.715]  You don't tell them it's dangerous, Jones.
[00:09:17.715 --> 00:09:18.216]  Shut up!
[00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:22.003]  Oh, but I'm proven right again.
[00:09:22.003 --> 00:09:24.507]  And I'm not saying this cult, and it clearly is that.
[00:09:24.507 --> 00:09:25.710]  The police are investigating it.
[00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:28.315]  Hundreds of women, reportedly.
[00:09:28.315 --> 00:09:31.120]  Many of us... Masses have escaped.
[00:09:32.096 --> 00:09:42.069]  And it's always some little narcissistic power-tripping sociopath slash psychopath who wants to be God and needs people to grovel before them.
[00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:50.039]  Anyone who was really successful and powerful would be ashamed of something like that and would want to empower people.
[00:09:50.814 --> 00:10:06.906]  But modern feminism is a creation of Edward Bernays and the Department of War and the Ford and Carnegie Endowment starting in the 1920s, and it's all declassified.
[00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:19.595]  And it's meant to do one thing and one thing only, and that is to debase women and the family in their own admissions, and they have done a spectacular job.
[00:10:23.303 --> 00:10:27.085]  Men are drooling idiots trying to act tough.
[00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:31.787]  Women run around confused as angry tarts.
[00:10:31.787 --> 00:10:49.816]  The children wander the wilderness of the internet and television being bombarded by Viacom and other weaponized media to destroy their attention spans, fry their brains and turn them into jibbering mental patients.
[00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.597]  Because if they can't get your child
[00:10:53.612 --> 00:10:56.593]  Where they want them physically, they're going to get them there mentally.
[00:10:56.593 --> 00:11:01.735]  They're going to get them through the whole medical system as well.
[00:11:01.735 --> 00:11:04.876]  So that's all coming up today.
[00:11:04.876 --> 00:11:11.418]  And we've just got the video of where I warn the women, you think you're joining a feminist group.
[00:11:11.418 --> 00:11:16.380]  And these are really women that desire to dominate other people.
[00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.681]  But they've always got a man in the background running the show.
[00:11:22.313 --> 00:11:25.778]  And again, people are trying to set these up everywhere.
[00:11:25.778 --> 00:11:37.095]  Every two-bit, know-it-all shaman who takes ayahuasca or, you know, all this other stuff and then decides that they have interfaced with God and that they are this big leader.
[00:11:37.095 --> 00:11:38.276]  It's everywhere in Austin.
[00:11:39.197 --> 00:11:53.105]  Almost every gym and group is really a front for people taking a bunch of hallucinogens and having some guru, and the women get enlightened by having sex with the guru, and it's just, come on people!
[00:11:53.105 --> 00:12:04.531]  And these nerds, they just sit around and decide how to set up cults.
[00:12:04.531 --> 00:12:05.031]  That's what they do.
[00:12:08.817 --> 00:12:12.298]  And it's all a big joke to them.
[00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:13.979]  Well, I'm setting up a cult.
[00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:19.140]  It's the cult of the individual and the cult of real empowerment.
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.840]  There's no meetings.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.761]  There's no groups with me.
[00:12:20.761 --> 00:12:25.422]  I go home alone.
[00:12:25.422 --> 00:12:29.143]  There's no Church Alex Jones.
[00:12:29.143 --> 00:12:30.884]  That's why they hate my guts so bad.
[00:12:30.884 --> 00:12:33.985]  Because see, I am fulfilled.
[00:12:33.985 --> 00:12:35.185]  I have a mission.
[00:12:35.185 --> 00:12:36.266]  I am enlightened.
[00:12:36.266 --> 00:12:37.126]  I know what's going on.
[00:12:38.553 --> 00:12:56.634]  I know when they take these hard core hallucinogens that do break interdimensionally through into the levels you experience in deep sleep and that you're actually conscious within your unconscious that you then see across the void and see that time space is filled with other entities.
[00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:12.177]  And of course they always tell you you're God, because you're with them, and you're all powerful, and you're gonna tell everybody what to do, and it's pure, lower-dimensional Satanism.
[00:13:12.177 --> 00:13:15.179]  That's all it is.
[00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:17.940]  And it's the New Age weapon program.
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:24.744]  It's the CIA hallucinogen program, rolled out on the streets, against the people.
[00:13:24.744 --> 00:13:27.206]  You can argue well, you can be enlightened with hallucinogens.
[00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.492]  Undoubtedly.
[00:13:31.492 --> 00:13:38.479]  But the issue is not in a cult with them spiritually manipulating it and amplifying it and bringing it in.
[00:13:40.014 --> 00:13:40.834]  To their system.
[00:13:40.834 --> 00:13:44.156]  You don't want to be around that or involved with that.
[00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:49.339]  And just like the Bible says, pharmakeia and sorcery is the way to being enslaved.
[00:13:49.339 --> 00:13:51.000]  And it always leads there.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:00.905]  It's always about some person that thinks they're God ruling over you and setting up a little petty kingdom.
[00:14:00.905 --> 00:14:02.666]  Because the devil couldn't have it in heaven.
[00:14:05.592 --> 00:14:15.061]  And he wants to have it here, and all of his slaves are the same little self-centered wimps, running around seeking for power.
[00:14:15.061 --> 00:14:21.287]  And as they join with the great oneness of the universe, the little devil on their shoulder, when they're
[00:14:22.552 --> 00:14:27.196]  Absolutely taking more DMT than you, you know, release when you die.
[00:14:27.196 --> 00:14:38.827]  You're having a near-death experience and the little demons right there telling you it's God and you're God and everything and feel all this, feel the timelessness, feel all everything else.
[00:14:38.827 --> 00:14:41.910]  That's, that's you, that's me.
[00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:42.971]  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.901]  And then people come out of it and go, I'm a god!
[00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:48.201]  I'm a shaman!
[00:14:48.201 --> 00:14:49.301]  I'm on a power trip!
[00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:51.382]  And you're just like, man, give me a break.
[00:14:51.382 --> 00:15:05.646]  You're running a program that was put in your mind when you got spirit guided, lured in to a black magic ritual, and didn't even know what you were a part of.
[00:15:05.646 --> 00:15:10.167]  See, I don't need DMT to go where you go.
[00:15:10.167 --> 00:15:11.628]  I can go there anytime I want.
[00:15:12.756 --> 00:15:18.560]  And that's why the globalists hate me, because they know I'm right there staring right back at them the whole time.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.541]  But so is everybody else.
[00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:22.282]  That's why they want to hurt your consciousness.
[00:15:22.282 --> 00:15:24.163]  That's why they want to inject you with heavy metals.
[00:15:24.163 --> 00:15:25.784]  It's why they want to fry your brain.
[00:15:25.784 --> 00:15:30.967]  It's why they want to control you and absolutely suppress you.
[00:15:30.967 --> 00:15:38.452]  Because they want to artificially bring you into a new reality they are constructing within reality as a prison.
[00:15:38.452 --> 00:15:42.254]  And they don't want you to ever know you entered into it.
[00:15:44.415 --> 00:15:53.868]  And they hate Christian churches because real people lovingly get together and love each other and feel God and amplify that.
[00:15:53.868 --> 00:15:58.355]  And that's like nails on a chalkboard to these devil-worshippers.
[00:15:59.915 --> 00:16:01.376]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.

[00:20:41.456 --> 00:20:47.560]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:59.804 --> 00:21:03.507]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:21:03.507 --> 00:21:06.510]  Let me just mention some of the news coming up.
[00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:25.107]  We have Seibel Edmonds, a high-level, certified FBI, NSA whistleblower that ran translations in Arabic and Farsi for Special Forces operations, Special Forces Command, the CIA, you name it.
[00:21:26.897 --> 00:21:28.919]  And she's joining us in the next hour.
[00:21:28.919 --> 00:21:34.124]  Now, we had another whistleblower on this week, and the FBI came and picked him up and took him to a military base.
[00:21:34.124 --> 00:21:45.997]  And he's asked us not to give out his name and info yet, but he's been a well-known person in the intelligence community about Saudi Arabia's connection to Vegas, Saudi Arabia's connection in their civil war to new attacks coming.
[00:21:47.025 --> 00:21:55.249]  Well, Cybill Edmonds can talk about that, but also how Mueller is involved with the Gulan movement and others, and a big cover-up happening there.
[00:21:55.249 --> 00:22:00.032]  And by the way, every time we cover this, we get hack attacks, threats.
[00:22:00.032 --> 00:22:01.973]  I mean, this is a powerful group.
[00:22:01.973 --> 00:22:05.415]  And I'm not in the middle of it with Eargun or the Gulan movement.
[00:22:05.415 --> 00:22:07.156]  I know they hate each other.
[00:22:07.156 --> 00:22:08.637]  It's a very complex situation.
[00:22:08.637 --> 00:22:14.420]  And I did know about Michael Flynn and stuff that was going on a year ago with this.
[00:22:15.772 --> 00:22:24.056]  And Flynn was siding with the United States for our sovereignty and our security, exposing the Gulan network.
[00:22:24.056 --> 00:22:38.003]  And that's what Mueller's now got, is that General Flynn was out of the military, talking to the Turkish government and others about terror networks and other organizations here in the U.S.
[00:22:38.003 --> 00:22:40.864]  Give the guy a Medal of Freedom award.
[00:22:40.864 --> 00:22:41.665]  Don't put him in jail.
[00:22:42.892 --> 00:22:46.476]  Of course, the former head of Defense Intelligence thinks he knows what's going on.
[00:22:46.476 --> 00:22:49.680]  By the way, who do you think he listens to?
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:49.720]  So...
[00:22:55.034 --> 00:22:58.238]  And people listen to me, not because they're even learning anything.
[00:22:58.238 --> 00:23:02.263]  People at that level go, wow, why is that the only show that knows what's going on?
[00:23:02.263 --> 00:23:04.286]  And how does that guy know all this?
[00:23:04.286 --> 00:23:09.913]  I had the FBI call up a few weeks ago and just go, how did you do what you did on Vegas?
[00:23:09.913 --> 00:23:12.857]  Where I said, I think they'll attack at 10 o'clock at night in the next few days.
[00:23:17.285 --> 00:23:17.786]  I don't know.
[00:23:37.711 --> 00:23:41.732]  We have terror networks in this country that are run by the Deep State Breakaway Group.
[00:23:41.732 --> 00:23:58.198]  You don't think Obama and Hillary and the globalists and all them just started the Arab Spring and killed over a million people, hundreds of thousands of them, Christians, and displaced millions, and invaded Europe with Jihad armies, military-aged men, 8 million of them, another 2 million were women and children.
[00:23:58.198 --> 00:24:03.560]  You don't think they just did that by accident, and you don't think they're just going to give up?
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.741]  Launching ICBMs at Saudi Arabia out of Yemen,
[00:24:07.443 --> 00:24:08.944]  All hell breaking loose.
[00:24:08.944 --> 00:24:15.610]  They've got stay-behind networks, sleeper cells, in this country.
[00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:21.194]  And the word is, from our sources, is they've basically been activated and been prepared.
[00:24:21.194 --> 00:24:29.921]  And it's such a hot subject, within two hours of our guest, not even saying his full name on air, the FBI came and grabbed him.
[00:24:29.921 --> 00:24:33.324]  And the media spun it and said, oh, Jones claims he's got another source.
[00:24:33.324 --> 00:24:35.286]  Yeah, like I said, well, the president
[00:24:36.553 --> 00:24:40.195]  Says that he's looking to release it.
[00:24:40.195 --> 00:24:44.258]  Same day they go, Jones is making it up, Stone's making it up, the President is not releasing it.
[00:24:44.258 --> 00:24:47.360]  President tweets the next day, I am releasing the JFK files.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.082]  I mean, come on folks.
[00:24:50.082 --> 00:24:54.104]  The issue here isn't about who's right and who's wrong, we know who's right.
[00:24:54.104 --> 00:24:56.786]  We know who told you Hillary had health problems, it's now confirmed.
[00:24:56.786 --> 00:24:58.968]  Donna Brazile.
[00:24:58.968 --> 00:25:00.869]  It's about stopping the terror attacks.
[00:25:02.932 --> 00:25:06.335]  And it's about realizing there's a civil war within the government going on.
[00:25:06.335 --> 00:25:10.138]  So Sabel Edmonds is joining us in the next hour.
[00:25:10.138 --> 00:25:30.096]  Shepard Ambulance is going to be back in studio with the latest on his deep investigations of the Saudi military conferences and government conferences that were going on in Vegas on October 1st and all the rest of the story.
[00:25:31.328 --> 00:25:54.724]  And that's why the public's not been told what happened there, because everything points towards an arms deal that was used as a cover for an assassination operation on some of the princes that were not allied with the Wahhabis, and the whole ongoing civil war, and helicopters blowing up, and people getting killed in their houses, and cars blowing up.
[00:25:54.724 --> 00:25:57.786]  I mean, every few minutes, it's happening.
[00:25:57.786 --> 00:26:00.508]  There is a full-on war in Saudi Arabia right now.
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:17.324]  And remember what we told you on November 1st, eight days ago, Saudi Arabia connections to Vegas, more attacks could be coming.
[00:26:17.324 --> 00:26:19.905]  And now you're starting to see it on the news.
[00:26:19.905 --> 00:26:27.367]  And just watch when it comes out!
[00:26:27.367 --> 00:26:29.748]  Because the deep state
[00:26:31.032 --> 00:26:37.225]  He wants to just use this against America, and use this against Trump, and use this against gun owners, and attack churches.
[00:26:37.225 --> 00:26:41.535]  Oh, and let's look at Devin Patrick Kelly.
[00:26:44.002 --> 00:27:09.506]  Attacked his wife, attacked his stepchild, fractured the baby's skull, came to the base to kill his chain of command, gets thrown in a mental institution, he escapes after months, and they don't put out an all-points bulletin, and they don't put in his file that he was dishonorably discharged so he could illegally get weapons and pop back up
[00:27:10.475 --> 00:27:12.837]  With another group of ne'er-do-wells.
[00:27:12.837 --> 00:27:17.540]  They've got a whole cell of these guys in Central Texas.
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:22.644]  I'm going to leave it right there.
[00:27:22.644 --> 00:27:26.988]  And if you want to say MKUltra, please do.
[00:27:26.988 --> 00:27:39.838]  Because he fits the exact, precise, complete, total, cut out of, oh, you want to get sent to a hardcore psych facility?
[00:27:40.874 --> 00:27:42.755]  You want to kill the chain of command?
[00:27:42.755 --> 00:28:01.881]  And then he's allowed to escape, and then they don't try to pick him up, and they let him infiltrate back into the public, after he got his electroshock, and after he got put on all the drugs, and after he got put on his Ibogaine, and got put on his Ayahuasca, and told he was a god, and all the rest of the crap, and given some women, and given some more drugs.
[00:28:01.881 --> 00:28:04.982]  I mean, they had the Ninja 500, 600, 700 years ago, just off of
[00:28:11.411 --> 00:28:14.012]  Opium addiction and sex!
[00:28:14.012 --> 00:28:27.294]  They would train for 10 years for one assassination and commit seppuku, or suicide, by driving a short sword into their stomach and pulling it up to their heart.
[00:28:27.294 --> 00:28:32.996]  That was Japanese mind control!
[00:28:32.996 --> 00:28:37.957]  Imagine what they can do today!
[00:28:37.957 --> 00:28:39.217]  But it's incontrovertible
[00:28:41.923 --> 00:28:43.205]  That he was allowed to escape.
[00:28:43.205 --> 00:28:47.470]  And then protected.
[00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.911]  Stay with us.
[00:28:49.295 --> 00:28:51.216]  We are on the march.
[00:28:51.216 --> 00:28:54.138]  The empire is on the run.

[00:32:19.826 --> 00:32:21.006]  It's the highest quality.

[00:32:22.987 --> 00:32:23.848]  It is amazing.

[00:32:38.596 --> 00:32:40.478]  DNA Force and Bomb Defense.
[00:32:40.478 --> 00:32:40.998]  Probiotic.
[00:32:40.998 --> 00:32:41.878]  Now back in stock.
[00:32:41.878 --> 00:32:43.019]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:43.019 --> 00:32:46.861]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[00:32:46.861 --> 00:32:48.002]  It is an act of war.
[00:32:48.002 --> 00:32:50.043]  It is an act of standing up.
[00:32:50.043 --> 00:32:55.607]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[00:33:01.514 --> 00:33:04.196]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:25.097 --> 00:33:35.301]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.301 --> 00:33:39.022]  I'm your host, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:39.022 --> 00:33:39.863]  We have the big...
[00:33:42.063 --> 00:33:46.805]  FBI, NSA, CIA whistleblower joining us to expose Robert Mueller next hour.
[00:33:46.805 --> 00:33:48.086]  This will be exclusive.
[00:33:48.086 --> 00:33:49.786]  This will be extremely powerful.
[00:33:49.786 --> 00:33:52.387]  She's testified secretly to Congress before.
[00:33:52.387 --> 00:33:56.749]  She's broken and violated federal gag orders exposing 9-11 and the stand-down.
[00:33:56.749 --> 00:34:04.092]  And of course, she was vindicated by the 28 pages that Congress has now released part of.
[00:34:04.092 --> 00:34:09.514]  She'll be joining us.
[00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:10.755]  Devin Patrick
[00:34:13.171 --> 00:34:20.314]  Kelly was allowed to assault his wife and his stepchild and break their bones.
[00:34:20.314 --> 00:34:37.442]  Then when he attacked or tried to attack with firearms the chain of command at a Air Force base, he was sent to a mental institution, a mysterious facility, a laboratory level facility.
[00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:39.403]  We're talking electroshock.
[00:34:39.403 --> 00:34:41.264]  We're talking experimentation type facility.
[00:34:41.264 --> 00:34:41.924]  If you look it up,
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:57.585]  And he then was allowed to flee, not have an APB put out for him, and they never filed the paperwork that he had a dishonorable discharge, so he could get fired arms.
[00:34:57.585 --> 00:35:01.186]  Look at that weak-minded creature.
[00:35:01.186 --> 00:35:12.570]  He's got MKUltra, MKNaomi, Monarch program, you name it, written all over him, and those are just declassified mind control programs.
[00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:21.631]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've been putting human brains in rats for 30 years.
[00:35:21.631 --> 00:35:25.612]  They just announced it yesterday.
[00:35:25.612 --> 00:35:30.573]  They've been putting microchips in people's brains for 40 years.
[00:35:30.573 --> 00:35:35.735]  And if you don't know, they've got mind control down to a fine art.
[00:35:35.735 --> 00:35:37.255]  You're living on another planet.
[00:35:42.793 --> 00:35:54.542]  The reason I'm saying mind control, that this is a deep state, shadow government, destabilization operation, is because this is exactly what mind control programs have been used for, is assassination operations.
[00:35:54.542 --> 00:36:02.788]  And where the disposable individuals don't even know why they're doing it, they are compelled to do it.
[00:36:02.788 --> 00:36:08.412]  And the military is heavily into this, and you've got shadow groups now working to destabilize the country.
[00:36:12.352 --> 00:36:19.556]  And the media will try to make jokes out of this, but the globalists are obsessed with mind control and mind war.
[00:36:19.556 --> 00:36:21.297]  It's what they do.
[00:36:21.297 --> 00:36:27.321]  And the fact that they didn't put out a warrant for him to be picked up when he's supposedly going to try to kill everybody on the base?
[00:36:28.257 --> 00:36:33.699]  And then he flees months later from a mental institution, and then they don't say pick him up.
[00:36:33.699 --> 00:36:35.220]  They don't say anything.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:41.602]  And then years later, he goes and does this, and he legally gets firearms because they didn't put him in the database.
[00:36:41.602 --> 00:36:47.224]  Bare minimum, they were insanely negligent for their own safety.
[00:36:47.224 --> 00:36:49.905]  Don't believe it for a minute.
[00:36:49.905 --> 00:36:51.806]  This boy is part of a project.
[00:36:52.816 --> 00:37:02.902]  A program, and he got off the reservation a little bit, but he went back into his doctor's, and he got back on the reservation, didn't he?
[00:37:02.902 --> 00:37:04.483]  He was a good boy.
[00:37:04.483 --> 00:37:08.786]  He did a good job according to his handlers.
[00:37:08.786 --> 00:37:14.550]  And you know, they've got a big nest right here in Central Texas of those.
[00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:20.333]  Nice little nest.
[00:37:20.333 --> 00:37:20.533]  So,
[00:37:21.667 --> 00:37:31.512]  Carry your firearms, ladies and gentlemen, because you never know when a wound up pedophile devil worshipper is going to come walking through your door.
[00:37:31.512 --> 00:37:38.596]  And it turns out he's a pedophile, turns out he hates Christians, turns out he's into the occult.
[00:37:38.596 --> 00:37:45.200]  As I told you, most of these atheists that are anti-Christian, they're crypto-Satanist.
[00:37:46.305 --> 00:37:50.488]  Just like, the anarchists are really communist, but they go, communism doesn't exist!
[00:37:50.488 --> 00:37:54.751]  They've all got, you know, Mao and Lenin tattoos, and we're Red Guard, we're gonna kill you!
[00:37:54.751 --> 00:37:56.372]  They're like, oh, just last year you were anarchist.
[00:37:56.372 --> 00:37:57.053]  That's right!
[00:37:57.053 --> 00:37:58.454]  Now it's revolution, scum!
[00:37:58.454 --> 00:38:02.517]  And we love Satan!
[00:38:02.517 --> 00:38:12.204]  And they're just the perfect people to be inducted into drugs, and hypnotism, and electroshock, and programming, and then you can just tell them, you're a god!
[00:38:12.204 --> 00:38:14.706]  Here's your program terms, here, take this, boom!
[00:38:17.503 --> 00:38:21.024]  It's like Sirhan Sirhan was drugged in front of people, given an amnesia.
[00:38:21.024 --> 00:38:22.685]  He was just the diversion.
[00:38:22.685 --> 00:38:26.727]  And then in comes the wind-up toy.
[00:38:26.727 --> 00:38:32.329]  They found Tim McVeigh drooling on the side of the road saying, it burns, it burns, I've got a chip.
[00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:38.551]  They blew my chip up.
[00:38:38.551 --> 00:38:45.474]  Because that's what they do.
[00:38:45.474 --> 00:38:46.735]  The old chips you just wave them.
[00:38:47.659 --> 00:38:47.879]  Yeah.
[00:39:03.254 --> 00:39:04.194]  People in the U.S.
[00:39:04.194 --> 00:39:15.638]  admittedly, they got federal grants for advanced brain chips just the last 20 years, mainly military personnel for PTSD and depression or brain injury.
[00:39:15.638 --> 00:39:17.298]  Oh, we got something that's going to fix you.
[00:39:17.298 --> 00:39:20.539]  And they're just testing on everybody.
[00:39:20.539 --> 00:39:29.322]  They've got chips decades ago where you can, with a joystick, control somebody, have somebody sit down, have them go to the bathroom, have them just joystick around.
[00:39:29.322 --> 00:39:31.343]  They had 30 years ago RoboRats.
[00:39:32.403 --> 00:39:36.829]  It would just, had a brain shift and it would just go into rubble with a video camera.
[00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:38.190]  You can look all this up.
[00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:42.556]  So, understand ladies and gentlemen, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:39:44.537 --> 00:39:47.880]  You will get chipped eventually, says USA Today.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:49.021]  You will.
[00:39:49.021 --> 00:39:50.642]  And ABC News, you will.
[00:39:50.642 --> 00:39:52.023]  CBS News, you will.
[00:39:52.023 --> 00:39:55.165]  And now, Stockholm Syndrome, Stockholm, Sweden.
[00:39:55.165 --> 00:39:58.288]  Oh, if you want to get on the train, you get discounts right now if you take the chip.
[00:39:58.288 --> 00:40:04.713]  But soon, they said officially this year, soon you're going to have to have it because we have identity theft problems.
[00:40:04.713 --> 00:40:07.255]  And just work with the community.
[00:40:09.076 --> 00:40:11.397]  And now more and more companies are making people get them.
[00:40:11.397 --> 00:40:21.000]  But again, the CIA told Wash Tech 15 years ago that, oh, we're pushing the body modification movement to get people ready for this.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.343]  And then when the Washington Post shows you the Swedish worker, he's got the big earrings and the body mod, which do that if you want.
[00:40:27.343 --> 00:40:30.164]  I'm just saying you got with the program, didn't you?
[00:40:31.328 --> 00:40:32.969]  You got with the program.
[00:40:32.969 --> 00:40:35.131]  And then they have the Today Show and all of it.
[00:40:35.131 --> 00:40:37.493]  They just laugh and Good Morning America.
[00:40:37.493 --> 00:40:39.714]  Oh, it's so much fun.
[00:40:39.714 --> 00:40:41.996]  Oh, it's so happy.
[00:40:41.996 --> 00:40:44.838]  Everybody's gonna get your chip soon.
[00:40:44.838 --> 00:40:46.279]  We told you 20 years ago they're coming.
[00:40:46.279 --> 00:40:47.480]  They're gonna try to make you get chip.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.861]  Here's how they're gonna roll it out.
[00:40:48.861 --> 00:40:49.862]  Oh, Jones is insane.
[00:40:49.862 --> 00:40:51.984]  Now everything we told you again is happening.
[00:40:54.531 --> 00:40:55.772]  Oh, and your TV's watching you.
[00:40:55.772 --> 00:40:57.132]  Oh, and your phone's tracking you.
[00:40:57.132 --> 00:40:59.954]  Oh, oh, oh, and there are cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:40:59.954 --> 00:41:03.035]  Oh, and, and did we tell you?
[00:41:03.035 --> 00:41:04.216]  Did we tell you?
[00:41:04.216 --> 00:41:08.718]  And then all these little smiley people, we're going to go along with it because the big corporations give us money.
[00:41:08.718 --> 00:41:14.441]  And now Bezos and Buffett and Gates have more money than half the U.S.
[00:41:14.441 --> 00:41:16.602]  population.
[00:41:16.602 --> 00:41:19.563]  And it turns out there's a bill about to go through where the U.S.
[00:41:19.563 --> 00:41:22.305]  government will only order from Amazon.
[00:41:23.456 --> 00:41:27.559]  They're gonna have special portals that only go to it for government procurement.
[00:41:27.559 --> 00:41:30.381]  And they'll make 50 plus extra billion a year.
[00:41:30.381 --> 00:41:35.024]  And then Bezos can train us all how to be good little slaves!
[00:41:35.024 --> 00:41:39.988]  But he's liberal, so it's okay!
[00:41:39.988 --> 00:41:41.929]  And that's why they're in economic warfare with us.
[00:41:41.929 --> 00:41:45.151]  That's why they don't want us to have websites or have products.
[00:41:45.151 --> 00:41:46.052]  And that's why they want to shut us down.
[00:41:46.052 --> 00:41:47.653]  That's why they lie about us every day.
[00:41:47.653 --> 00:41:49.655]  Because they want a total monopoly.
[00:41:49.655 --> 00:41:51.316]  And Amazon is the company store.
[00:41:52.824 --> 00:41:55.125]  I owe my soul to the company store.
[00:41:55.125 --> 00:41:56.706]  Why they always have free shipping!
[00:41:56.706 --> 00:42:02.910]  So that everyone just expects free shipping when they get a $1.48 government subsidy on every order on shipping!
[00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:03.851]  But you don't!
[00:42:03.851 --> 00:42:05.692]  And I don't!
[00:42:05.692 --> 00:42:08.074]  And then you think you get ahead by buying something from Amazon.
[00:42:08.074 --> 00:42:10.715]  Oh, I don't want to pay for shipping at Infowars store!
[00:42:10.715 --> 00:42:12.636]  I want to get my free stuff!
[00:42:12.636 --> 00:42:15.098]  Hell, it's free alright!
[00:42:15.098 --> 00:42:18.620]  As free as getting your throat slit and thrown down a well!
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:20.061]  But Bezos is cute!
[00:42:20.061 --> 00:42:21.182]  He's liberal, so it's alright!
[00:42:22.523 --> 00:42:24.131]  He'll take real good care of you, don't worry.
[00:42:24.131 --> 00:42:26.903]  Cause you're in his cult now.
[00:42:28.669 --> 00:42:29.510]  We have free shipping.
[00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:32.612]  We don't always do it, but to match the great Amazon, free shipping!
[00:42:32.612 --> 00:42:33.733]  It's not gonna last long.
[00:42:33.733 --> 00:42:37.837]  And 50% off on a bunch of our best-selling products to help fund the InfoWar.

[00:42:44.222 --> 00:42:45.843]  Do you understand?
[00:42:45.843 --> 00:42:49.767]  They're on board with the force that wants to destroy humanity.
[00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:53.009]  Everything they do is pure hate towards you and your family.
[00:42:53.009 --> 00:42:55.832]  Everything they do is committed to destroying you!
[00:42:57.813 --> 00:43:01.575]  My fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with a very important message.

[00:47:01.005 --> 00:47:03.627]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.399 --> 00:47:17.480]  The Matrix is everywhere.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.001]  It is all around us.
[00:47:19.001 --> 00:47:21.263]  Even now, in this very room.
[00:47:21.263 --> 00:47:23.444]  You can see it when you look out your window.
[00:47:23.444 --> 00:47:25.586]  Or when you turn on your television.
[00:47:25.586 --> 00:47:28.468]  You can feel it when you go to work.
[00:47:28.468 --> 00:47:29.928]  When you go to church.
[00:47:29.928 --> 00:47:31.529]  When you pay your debt.
[00:47:31.529 --> 00:47:36.953]  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
[00:47:36.953 --> 00:47:39.034]  That you are a slave.
[00:47:39.034 --> 00:47:41.816]  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage.
[00:47:41.816 --> 00:47:44.658]  Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste.
[00:47:52.236 --> 00:47:54.357]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:54.357 --> 00:48:02.940]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.321]  I know why people don't want to admit what's going on.
[00:48:05.321 --> 00:48:12.223]  Even though it's all in plain view now.
[00:48:12.223 --> 00:48:13.124]  Because it's frightening.
[00:48:13.124 --> 00:48:18.986]  But I tell you what's more frightening is not doing anything about it.
[00:48:18.986 --> 00:48:19.706]  Just giving up.
[00:48:21.118 --> 00:48:26.301]  Or just taking on that worldly spirit of laughing about it and making fun of people that care.
[00:48:26.301 --> 00:48:32.165]  As if you're part of the power structure because you pretend you are.
[00:48:32.165 --> 00:48:37.929]  Little useless handmaidens.
[00:48:37.929 --> 00:48:39.650]  For death.
[00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.152]  Death that doesn't regenerate.
[00:48:42.152 --> 00:48:47.055]  Death that is simply a hate letter to God.
[00:48:51.491 --> 00:48:57.165]  I haven't even gotten to the news, and it's not for lack of incredibly over-the-top news.
[00:48:57.165 --> 00:48:58.950]  But the fight really is against good and evil.
[00:49:00.097 --> 00:49:06.941]  You know, there's something I came late to the table on, and that was the all-out war on Christians and Christmas.
[00:49:06.941 --> 00:49:22.489]  I mean, I knew there was persecution of Christians, and I knew that the communists had banned it, but I would hear, you know, 20 years ago, people calling and going, we're mad about the war on Christmas, and they're suing nativity scenes, and I'm like, yeah, that's just mentally ill atheists and people wanting to be in the paper.
[00:49:22.489 --> 00:49:24.410]  But then I found that it was coordinated worldwide.
[00:49:25.441 --> 00:49:26.361]  And now even the U.N.
[00:49:26.361 --> 00:49:30.502]  admits double the amount of Christian persecution there was just a decade ago.
[00:49:30.502 --> 00:49:31.522]  They said last year.
[00:49:31.522 --> 00:49:36.403]  I mean, it's millions of Christians, two plus million are killed a year.
[00:49:36.403 --> 00:49:39.944]  I mean, it is just Holocaust level every day.
[00:49:39.944 --> 00:49:43.224]  But Hollywood isn't going to say a word about it.
[00:49:43.224 --> 00:49:47.145]  They did do the Armenian genocide, which Hollywood did do the right thing on that.
[00:49:47.145 --> 00:49:53.166]  So, you know, I guess you can always get reprieved, but not much.
[00:49:53.166 --> 00:49:54.066]  But it starts something.
[00:49:55.285 --> 00:50:02.629]  But see, I was against all these Middle East wars because I knew the globalists wanted to put in radical regimes to destabilize things, which has been proven right.
[00:50:02.629 --> 00:50:06.732]  And Trump was against that, showing that he was right.
[00:50:06.732 --> 00:50:09.593]  But it's the anti-Christian nature.
[00:50:09.593 --> 00:50:13.656]  I see articles every year, in Texas even, where little kids will hand out
[00:50:14.687 --> 00:50:18.571]  Christmas cards, and the teachers expel them, and they go, that's religious.
[00:50:18.571 --> 00:50:19.952]  Well, you have your free speech.
[00:50:19.952 --> 00:50:25.657]  Doesn't mean the school that's state-funded, citizen-funded, has an official religion.
[00:50:25.657 --> 00:50:26.458]  I agree with that.
[00:50:26.458 --> 00:50:27.960]  It shouldn't.
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.161]  Separation of church and state.
[00:50:29.161 --> 00:50:32.964]  I don't want your religion being forced on me through my tax money.
[00:50:32.964 --> 00:50:38.710]  They do the opposite, though, in England and Germany and Sweden.
[00:50:40.066 --> 00:50:42.968]  They take the kids forcibly every year to mosque.
[00:50:42.968 --> 00:50:44.409]  They have them write about the Koran.
[00:50:44.409 --> 00:50:53.557]  They are telling them, don't do anything Christian, but be Muslim.
[00:50:53.557 --> 00:50:59.521]  And then you've got the official EU plan to make Europe Islamic.
[00:50:59.521 --> 00:51:03.324]  It turns out they have from a hundred years ago that they developed a plan for.
[00:51:03.324 --> 00:51:05.446]  And we've talked about that plan here on air.
[00:51:05.446 --> 00:51:07.448]  I mean, there's even Wikipedia pages about it.
[00:51:07.448 --> 00:51:08.869]  It's just crazy.
[00:51:10.899 --> 00:51:22.281]  That they do this and they say, these holidays belong to gays, Muslims, Sikhs, Asians, gay couples that have an adopted baby.
[00:51:22.281 --> 00:51:25.702]  Which, you know, most of the time it's CPS taking a heterosexual couple's baby.
[00:51:25.702 --> 00:51:26.782]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[00:51:26.782 --> 00:51:29.182]  We are harvested.
[00:51:29.182 --> 00:51:33.243]  We are persecuted.
[00:51:33.243 --> 00:51:38.284]  And we've got it on screen about, you know, the UK kids made to pray at the mosque, not just visit the mosque.
[00:51:38.284 --> 00:51:39.504]  So, this is going on.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:47.235]  And now Tesco, one of the biggest grocery store chains in Europe and the UK.
[00:51:47.235 --> 00:51:48.638]  I've bought stuff in there repeatedly.
[00:51:49.684 --> 00:51:56.070]  You'll drive for like a hundred miles in England and see no stores until you see one of these big, big, big supermarkets.
[00:51:56.070 --> 00:52:11.043]  Tesco, a UK-based supermarket chain, has launched their first Christmas commercial of the holiday season featuring multicultural cast and multi-religion symbolism, but conspicuously omitted any overt references to Christianity in the ad.
[00:52:11.043 --> 00:52:11.724]  You can have
[00:52:12.847 --> 00:52:22.435]  Islamic stuff, Islamic symbols, and see them mixing it in with the more politically correct tenenbaum and Norse and Germanic evergreens and things.
[00:52:22.435 --> 00:52:29.440]  So all that's okay, but don't you show anything Christian on Christmas, which means Christ.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.342]  In fact, just call it holidays.
[00:52:31.342 --> 00:52:34.705]  And now it's women in burqas and hijabs
[00:52:36.036 --> 00:52:36.797]  Celebrating it.
[00:52:36.797 --> 00:52:39.318]  It's their holiday, not yours.
[00:52:39.318 --> 00:52:41.760]  See, that's even sweeter anti-Christian.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:42.660]  We're gonna take it over.
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:43.921]  We're gonna commercialize it.
[00:52:43.921 --> 00:52:45.282]  We're not gonna let you use it.
[00:52:45.282 --> 00:52:49.464]  We're gonna tell you you're bad if it's religious or Christian.
[00:52:49.464 --> 00:52:57.949]  But then we're gonna take it and we're gonna make it a gay couple with a kid and we're gonna make it Muslims and we're not gonna include you.
[00:52:57.949 --> 00:52:59.991]  Just like they tell people at the colleges everywhere.
[00:52:59.991 --> 00:53:01.812]  Whites can't come to school this weekend.
[00:53:01.812 --> 00:53:02.172]  You're bad.
[00:53:03.306 --> 00:53:07.867]  Or, how dare you run for the Portland City Council?
[00:53:07.867 --> 00:53:08.987]  I saw that yesterday.
[00:53:08.987 --> 00:53:10.267]  You're a white man.
[00:53:10.267 --> 00:53:14.288]  You're not allowed to be in office.
[00:53:14.288 --> 00:53:21.349]  And then another city council's quote, all queer now to use that term, their term they use.
[00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:24.150]  There it is, Portland candidate berated for being white male.
[00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:26.990]  How dare you run against three women of color?
[00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:29.111]  How dare you exist?
[00:53:29.111 --> 00:53:31.031]  This is literal Nazi ideology.
[00:53:33.226 --> 00:53:44.376]  And it's a rubbing it in, a force feeding, an agenda to get us all destabilized, right as the AI and the robots replacing everybody come in.
[00:53:44.376 --> 00:53:48.560]  While we're busy fighting with each other, here come the robots.
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:51.423]  But we got to fight because the Muslims are programmed to take over.
[00:53:51.423 --> 00:53:53.504]  They admit that.
[00:53:53.504 --> 00:53:59.410]  So despite the fact they're human and I want them to be free, I still have to deal with that programmed onslaught.
[00:54:02.159 --> 00:54:11.705]  Through their mind control religion, their political Islam, and then I'm just here desperately trying to have a future, folks, and I'm telling you what's happening here.
[00:54:11.705 --> 00:54:14.987]  And the official establishment says we will be replaced.
[00:54:14.987 --> 00:54:16.708]  We are obsolete.
[00:54:16.708 --> 00:54:18.589]  You are obsolete.
[00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:22.371]  Now shovel yourself into your grave.
[00:54:22.371 --> 00:54:23.952]  The decision's been made.
[00:54:23.952 --> 00:54:24.633]  Why do you think they have...
[00:54:25.874 --> 00:54:37.284]  House Intelligence Committee and Senate Defense Committee meetings and they go, Alex Jones must be stopped!
[00:54:37.284 --> 00:54:39.566]  It's because they know they signed on to this.
[00:54:39.566 --> 00:54:40.607]  They're scared.
[00:54:40.607 --> 00:54:41.728]  They want a place at the table.
[00:54:42.981 --> 00:54:49.385]  They know that there's only going to be maximum 10% of the people left when this is done, and they all want a seat at the table.
[00:54:49.385 --> 00:54:59.911]  They're not going to give you seats at the table, you little... You're not even effeminate, these little weak men who all talk like robots and all say the same thing and all just bait a male around.
[00:54:59.911 --> 00:55:03.073]  You've been chosen because you're traitors to lower the drawbridge.
[00:55:03.073 --> 00:55:07.275]  The minute this is completed, you're all gone.
[00:55:12.461 --> 00:55:14.202]  Show the house hearing!
[00:55:14.202 --> 00:55:17.164]  Where they were going to... Don't worry, sir, we banned him at lunch.
[00:55:17.164 --> 00:55:18.985]  We banned Paul Watson and Alex Jones.
[00:55:18.985 --> 00:55:20.326]  And the conversation's good.
[00:55:20.326 --> 00:55:21.927]  Now get on it better now.
[00:55:21.927 --> 00:55:32.554]  Yes, sir, he was number one, but we stopped it.
[00:55:32.554 --> 00:55:37.077]  But the problem is, as you know, sir, with the Panopticon tracking rate, it makes it harder for an assassination.
[00:55:37.077 --> 00:55:38.337]  That's what's really going on behind closed doors.
[00:55:39.915 --> 00:55:40.715]  Quigley.
[00:55:40.715 --> 00:55:42.396]  Why don't you just take care of him?
[00:55:42.396 --> 00:55:48.280]  Sir, the panopticon ignition of the program means other people inside the agencies would stop us if they knew we did it.
[00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:51.841]  Once it's purely automated in AI, then we can have the purges, sir.
[00:55:51.841 --> 00:55:52.762]  But we're so close!
[00:55:52.762 --> 00:55:54.143]  We're so close, sir!
[00:55:54.143 --> 00:55:55.143]  Hell, hey, get it done.
[00:55:55.143 --> 00:55:56.164]  I mean, that's... Oh, yeah.
[00:55:56.944 --> 00:55:59.685]  They don't like me because I see for miles and miles.
[00:55:59.685 --> 00:56:00.966]  Because I've studied them.
[00:56:00.966 --> 00:56:06.768]  Psychopaths, sociopaths, and followers are so programmable, they're not even really conscious.
[00:56:06.768 --> 00:56:08.268]  See, so they're robots.
[00:56:08.268 --> 00:56:09.349]  They only do a few things.
[00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:11.710]  I know what they do.
[00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:19.492]  Now there's controllers up behind them that are conscious, but are turned over to evil.
[00:56:19.492 --> 00:56:23.374]  But all of these men were chosen for their weakness and to not threaten
[00:56:24.898 --> 00:56:35.801]  The satanic alpha males at the top and their brood mothers, brood queens that lure the women in for the feast.
[00:56:35.801 --> 00:56:38.182]  Let's play the new TV ad here.
[00:56:38.182 --> 00:56:42.403]  Let's play Christmas for the Muslims and everybody else but not for Christians.
[00:56:42.403 --> 00:56:42.763]  Here it is.
[00:56:42.763 --> 00:56:43.404]  Here's the conquering.
[00:56:43.404 --> 00:56:44.884]  Let's go to it.
[00:56:44.884 --> 00:56:47.425]  Have a guess.
[00:56:51.781 --> 00:56:52.343]  He's a zombie.
[00:56:52.343 --> 00:56:54.368]  Everybody's a zombie.
[00:56:54.368 --> 00:56:55.751]  You did tip the giblets over.
[00:56:59.551 --> 00:57:01.432]  The gay guys, they get to have a family, you don't.
[00:57:01.432 --> 00:57:07.856]  Everyone's got their smartphones.
[00:57:07.856 --> 00:57:12.818]  See, they know to trick you to watch by showing you a smartphone on screen.
[00:57:12.818 --> 00:57:13.339]  That's it.
[00:57:13.339 --> 00:57:15.940]  They know you're under screen sickness.
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:18.942]  So they show you a phone to get you to look at the app.
[00:57:18.942 --> 00:57:21.463]  Because they know that the phone's mesmerizing you better.
[00:57:21.463 --> 00:57:25.906]  Have the Muslim women, other groups, Turkish, whatever,
[00:57:28.681 --> 00:57:33.684]  La la la, but no Christians.
[00:57:33.684 --> 00:57:37.326]  Oh, it's so cute.
[00:57:37.326 --> 00:57:39.247]  It's so liberal.
[00:57:39.247 --> 00:57:41.509]  However you do Christmas, we've got a turkey.
[00:57:41.509 --> 00:57:42.730]  And everybody's just eased in.
[00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:44.090]  Everyone's welcome at Tesco.
[00:57:44.090 --> 00:57:45.851]  All being killed by the chemical weapons.
[00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:46.532]  Let's just die.
[00:57:46.972 --> 00:57:48.413]  Everyone's dying to get out.
[00:57:48.413 --> 00:57:49.854]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:57:49.854 --> 00:57:51.174]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:57:51.174 --> 00:57:52.395]  Why is this so good?
[00:57:52.395 --> 00:57:57.678]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:57:57.678 --> 00:58:11.225]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:58:11.225 --> 00:58:12.566]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:58:13.346 --> 00:58:15.008]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:58:15.008 --> 00:58:17.570]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:18.871]  These are all parasites.
[00:58:18.871 --> 00:58:19.972]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:58:19.972 --> 00:58:21.313]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:58:21.313 --> 00:58:25.817]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:58:25.817 --> 00:58:28.979]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:58:28.979 --> 00:58:32.162]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:58:32.162 --> 00:58:33.223]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:58:33.223 --> 00:58:35.144]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:58:35.144 --> 00:58:36.165]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:58:36.165 --> 00:58:38.207]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:58:39.608 --> 00:58:40.789]  Can you support the broadcast?
[00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:42.110]  Infowarslives.com.
[00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:44.372]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:58:44.372 --> 00:58:49.436]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:58:49.436 --> 00:58:52.558]  America is an information-based civil war.
[00:58:52.558 --> 00:58:59.984]  That's why now, more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[00:58:59.984 --> 00:59:05.589]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[00:59:06.329 --> 00:59:14.020]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:21.911]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[00:59:22.612 --> 00:59:27.674]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[00:59:27.674 --> 00:59:29.815]  They are the anti-liberals.
[00:59:29.815 --> 00:59:43.181]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:43.181 --> 00:59:47.163]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:51.403 --> 00:59:54.965]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:54.965 --> 00:59:57.927]  Here's an updated boil-down of the demonization.
[00:59:57.927 --> 01:00:00.128]  We confirm suspicions at Veritas.
[01:00:00.128 --> 01:00:06.592]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[01:00:06.592 --> 01:00:09.473]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[01:00:09.473 --> 01:00:13.676]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.076 --> 01:00:37.363]  As of just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag, NYC Terrorist Attack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam, I warned de Blasio about New York City terror.
[01:00:37.363 --> 01:00:38.984]  He was too busy bashing Trump.
[01:00:39.204 --> 01:00:49.188]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:00:49.188 --> 01:00:56.410]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[01:00:56.410 --> 01:00:59.031]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:01.272]  He actually went on Jones' show and said,
[01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:03.971]  Your reputation's amazing.
[01:01:03.971 --> 01:01:05.432]  I will not let you down.
[01:01:05.432 --> 01:01:08.373]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:17.818]  He still calls Alex Jones and talks to him and, you know, the InfoWars conspiracy theories.
[01:01:17.818 --> 01:01:25.182]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people who saw this
[01:01:26.503 --> 01:01:28.745]  The Russians ran an extensive information war.
[01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:45.095]  Okay.
[01:02:04.614 --> 01:02:16.589]  Allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and begin to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[01:02:18.999 --> 01:02:28.306]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[01:02:28.306 --> 01:02:30.128]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[01:02:30.128 --> 01:02:40.176]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Rupley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[01:02:40.176 --> 01:02:42.658]  InfoWars comes to mind where those are echo chambers.
[01:02:42.958 --> 01:02:43.899]  It's all confirmed now.
[01:03:01.618 --> 01:03:02.599]  No, it's not.
[01:03:02.599 --> 01:03:14.126]  If a Google user types in Clinton body they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[01:03:14.126 --> 01:03:19.850]  The latest story was the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich who was murdered last month in an apparent robbery.
[01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:26.815]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has hinted that Rich was his source but has made no further comments about the case.
[01:03:26.815 --> 01:03:28.856]  That murder we should say remains unsolved.
[01:03:29.076 --> 01:03:40.865]  The Russians, in my opinion, and based on the intel and counterintel people I've talked to, could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided.
[01:03:40.865 --> 01:03:42.706]  All that stuff exists.
[01:03:42.706 --> 01:03:46.509]  You don't see it, you don't feel it if you're largely living in
[01:03:46.969 --> 01:03:53.195]  Reality and in a mainstream media world, but it's undermining our democracy.
[01:03:53.195 --> 01:03:56.838]  And I think that the companies themselves, they've taken some steps.
[01:03:56.838 --> 01:03:58.239]  They have a lot of responsibility.
[01:03:58.239 --> 01:04:02.103]  Companies like Facebook, Google, etc.
[01:04:02.103 --> 01:04:08.729]  To do what they can to essentially not enhance this
[01:04:08.849 --> 01:04:14.615]  How quickly can you act, and what's your responsibility to set the record straight?
[01:04:14.615 --> 01:04:15.816]  The system self-corrected.
[01:04:15.816 --> 01:04:18.638]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[01:04:18.638 --> 01:04:21.982]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[01:04:21.982 --> 01:04:23.243]  But you saw this?
[01:04:23.243 --> 01:04:24.104]  USA Today.
[01:04:24.104 --> 01:04:25.345]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[01:04:25.345 --> 01:04:27.567]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[01:04:27.847 --> 01:04:29.148]  That man's a threat to this country.
[01:04:29.148 --> 01:04:30.729]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[01:04:30.729 --> 01:04:32.551]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[01:04:32.551 --> 01:04:40.317]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him, and manually have to find that video.
[01:04:40.317 --> 01:04:48.324]  We're not going to allow that video, if it gets 10 million views, to be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[01:04:48.324 --> 01:04:51.166]  We'll be back with a top-seeding former FBI whistleblower.
[01:04:51.166 --> 01:04:53.168]  You are the resistance.
[01:04:53.168 --> 01:04:54.549]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:04:57.708 --> 01:05:00.832]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:05:00.832 --> 01:05:08.280]  That's why now more than ever we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullies.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:13.886]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:05:14.606 --> 01:05:21.955]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[01:05:21.955 --> 01:05:30.206]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:05:30.906 --> 01:05:35.969]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[01:05:35.969 --> 01:05:38.090]  They are the anti-liberals.
[01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:51.497]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:51.497 --> 01:05:55.459]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:06:00.869 --> 01:06:11.991]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:11.991 --> 01:06:15.692]  We're now into hour number two.
[01:06:15.692 --> 01:06:27.394]  For the next 45 minutes or so, Sabelle Edmonds, an amazing patriot who served this country honorably, who's one of the highest level whistleblowers ever to expose the standout of 9-11,
[01:06:29.102 --> 01:06:31.983]  Our government working with radical jihad groups in Saudi Arabia.
[01:06:31.983 --> 01:06:34.203]  I mean, she's got amazing information.
[01:06:34.203 --> 01:06:35.144]  She's got courage, too.
[01:06:35.144 --> 01:06:42.486]  She's broken federal gag orders before, during Bush and Obama, and exposed serious crimes, and they had to back down.
[01:06:42.486 --> 01:06:45.346]  And she's a journalist as well, newsbud.com.
[01:06:45.346 --> 01:06:47.227]  We're going to be going to her in a moment.
[01:06:47.227 --> 01:06:51.548]  Then when she leaves us in the last segment of this hour, I told you it was a hoax at the time.
[01:06:52.725 --> 01:07:02.449]  Because 99% of the time it was, and I saw how the Air Force responded in a huge PR campaign during the whole NFL anti-Trump race stuff.
[01:07:02.449 --> 01:07:07.391]  So I could just see the packaging, I could see the instant PR, and you know when something's produced.
[01:07:07.391 --> 01:07:13.633]  Kind of like Hillary did fake town halls, and I said, that shot 35mm, super HD, it's actors.
[01:07:13.633 --> 01:07:15.914]  The media said, Jones claims he has actors, it's fake.
[01:07:15.914 --> 01:07:17.194]  Came out a month later, it was all fake!
[01:07:19.062 --> 01:07:23.343]  We all know like when you're seeing a Hollywood movie versus real.
[01:07:23.343 --> 01:07:25.103]  I mean unless it's just the best.
[01:07:25.103 --> 01:07:27.004]  I gotta tell you watching The People versus O.J.
[01:07:27.004 --> 01:07:34.246]  Simpson, sometimes during that Netflix show, the actors were so good that it was like it was real.
[01:07:34.246 --> 01:07:36.566]  But that's, it was only part of the show too.
[01:07:36.566 --> 01:07:37.907]  Other parts weren't as good.
[01:07:37.907 --> 01:07:39.407]  I mean you know when something's fake.
[01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.304]  And it's the same deal.
[01:07:42.304 --> 01:07:49.871]  Air Force Academy discovers racial slurs were hoax months after superintendent lauded for tough speech.
[01:07:49.871 --> 01:07:51.952]  And I think he or one of his adjuncts is behind it.
[01:07:51.952 --> 01:07:53.113]  I mean, I'll just tell you point blank.
[01:07:53.113 --> 01:07:53.814]  That's my opinion.
[01:07:53.814 --> 01:07:59.579]  Because I saw the whole PR rollout within hours, the way it was all done at the whole peak of the NFL deal.
[01:07:59.579 --> 01:08:01.080]  This was deep state PR.
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.461]  This general's anti-Trump.
[01:08:02.461 --> 01:08:04.783]  This was a stunt.
[01:08:04.783 --> 01:08:05.764]  We know it was fake now.
[01:08:05.764 --> 01:08:07.005]  We know somebody pulled it.
[01:08:07.005 --> 01:08:09.187]  And I'm saying you're suspect number one, buddy.
[01:08:10.287 --> 01:08:15.970]  Continuing, Rand Paul's neighbors say it wasn't a dispute over the grass or the landscaping.
[01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:17.031]  The neighbor hated him.
[01:08:17.031 --> 01:08:22.594]  The neighbors called for violence against Trump, called for his testicles to be chopped off and all sorts of stuff.
[01:08:22.594 --> 01:08:27.236]  And he tackled him from behind and broke six of his ribs, we now learn, and punctured his lung.
[01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:29.738]  And the left is just celebrating the hell out of that.
[01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.059]  But his neighbors are now exposing it.
[01:08:31.059 --> 01:08:32.840]  Our story is up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:36.702]  Rand Paul reveals six broken ribs, lung condition after attack from socialist neighbor.
[01:08:37.912 --> 01:08:40.494]  That was part of their November 4th rampage.
[01:08:40.494 --> 01:08:43.916]  Congress hears ideas of altering clouds to offset climate change.
[01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:44.617]  Oh, McClatchy!
[01:08:44.617 --> 01:08:47.679]  I thought I heard of that on InfoWars, but a long time ago.
[01:08:47.679 --> 01:08:49.400]  So that's all coming up.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.281]  Putin says U.S.
[01:08:50.281 --> 01:08:52.082]  wants to disrupt upcoming Russian election.
[01:08:52.082 --> 01:08:52.742]  We're going to get to that.
[01:08:52.742 --> 01:08:59.547]  We're going to get to this Nexavum cult, where the women get branded and have to bring in other sex slaves.
[01:08:59.547 --> 01:09:03.330]  They thought it was a feminist group, but it was run by a man.
[01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:06.132]  I wasn't talking about this group a month ago.
[01:09:07.216 --> 01:09:10.452]  But in New York and in Hollywood and other places, this is how these work.
[01:09:11.391 --> 01:09:20.257]  They'll say it's a women empowerment group, and then it's being run by some beautiful women and they lure them in, and then they put them on hallucinogens, you name it.
[01:09:20.257 --> 01:09:23.679]  And I'm not saying this guy did it, but the police are going in.
[01:09:23.679 --> 01:09:26.541]  I'm just saying I knew about these type deals, not this one.
[01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:30.123]  And of course, Huffington Post attacked me and said I was horrible.
[01:09:30.123 --> 01:09:37.408]  I told women, if you go to a women empowerment group, they go, oh, by the way, just to prove you're into women being in charge, these women are going to put you in handcuffs.
[01:09:37.408 --> 01:09:39.089]  You like girls, don't you?
[01:09:39.089 --> 01:09:40.851]  And then next, you're being tortured.
[01:09:41.731 --> 01:09:43.392]  Or next, you're dead.
[01:09:43.392 --> 01:09:46.753]  And they attacked me for that when I broke it down.
[01:09:46.753 --> 01:09:48.093]  But now, that was where all this broke.
[01:09:48.093 --> 01:09:48.733]  Oh, see, I'm right again.
[01:09:48.733 --> 01:09:49.954]  Right there.
[01:09:49.954 --> 01:09:50.594]  See?
[01:09:50.594 --> 01:09:52.815]  So, there you go.
[01:09:52.815 --> 01:09:57.596]  It just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[01:09:57.596 --> 01:09:59.537]  Oh, you're a young, beautiful woman.
[01:09:59.537 --> 01:10:01.658]  You can trust other women, my dear.
[01:10:01.658 --> 01:10:03.639]  Come to our castle.
[01:10:03.639 --> 01:10:04.439]  Oh, there's no men here?
[01:10:04.439 --> 01:10:07.560]  Oh, no, we don't have men here until you're chained down.
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.540]  Until you're begging for your life.
[01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:08.860]  Oh, excuse me.
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:10.661]  You'll find out later when we brand you.
[01:10:11.684 --> 01:10:12.665]  We're liberal though.
[01:10:12.665 --> 01:10:20.930]  You know, Apple, we run companies with suicide nets and enforced abortions, but it's okay because Apple's liberal!
[01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:30.136]  See, as long as it's liberal, as long as they're pulling your teeth out with pliers and saying it's liberal, I mean, as long as you're shooting up a church and it's liberal, it's alright.
[01:10:30.136 --> 01:10:33.058]  And again, there's a whole dark side on the right wing as well.
[01:10:33.058 --> 01:10:34.699]  It's all a system of control.
[01:10:34.699 --> 01:10:36.560]  Now, let me just stop there and get into the main subject.
[01:10:38.277 --> 01:10:45.303]  So Mel Edmonds is one of the bravest people out there that I've seen in the last 15 years, 16 years, since 9-11.
[01:10:45.303 --> 01:10:50.127]  And I want her, in the few minutes we have before we go to break, just to tell people about herself, even though she doesn't like to talk about herself.
[01:10:50.127 --> 01:10:51.928]  She's an author, journalist, researcher.
[01:10:51.928 --> 01:11:04.019]  She was a high-level translator in Arabic and Farsi for the FBI with NSA intercepts, CIA intercepts, watching all the different agencies and confirming what Colonel Schaefer and others talked about, going on
[01:11:04.699 --> 01:11:06.281]  Pre 9-11 and on 9-11.
[01:11:06.281 --> 01:11:08.684]  And she exposed the sex trafficking, the weapon trafficking.
[01:11:08.684 --> 01:11:10.046]  It ties into Benghazi later.
[01:11:10.046 --> 01:11:11.508]  It ties into the Arab Spring.
[01:11:11.508 --> 01:11:15.232]  It ties into now, her big story we'll get to by the bottom of the hour.
[01:11:15.232 --> 01:11:18.276]  But I wanted to give folks some background from NewsBud.com.
[01:11:18.276 --> 01:11:20.679]  I'm going to tweak this out at real Alex Jones during the break.
[01:11:20.679 --> 01:11:21.901]  He's going to go mega viral.
[01:11:21.901 --> 01:11:23.102]  Targeting Michael Flynn!
[01:11:23.923 --> 01:11:29.747]  And shielding the radical cleric, Gulan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller must step down.
[01:11:29.747 --> 01:11:36.271]  This is the network that gets tens of billions of dollars a year of taxpayer money to run Muslim schools here in the U.S., yes.
[01:11:36.271 --> 01:11:41.934]  And it's an inner fight between Ergun and Gulan, who is a man, not just the group, and all this.
[01:11:41.934 --> 01:11:43.195]  And she is a leading
[01:11:44.349 --> 01:11:45.290]  Hello Alex.
[01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:47.811]  Many thanks for the invite and for this opportunity because
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:28.748]  Of all the angles, all the ongoing cases right now under these this farce Russiagate investigations, General Flynn's case is the case that stands out the most.
[01:12:29.525 --> 01:12:33.608]  And it is blacked out the most by the media.
[01:12:33.608 --> 01:12:45.838]  You either see false information, completely false information, unanimously put out by the media, and you also see all these blacked out information.
[01:12:45.838 --> 01:12:49.141]  So I'm really grateful for this opportunity.
[01:12:49.141 --> 01:12:56.267]  We at Newsbud have been covering nonstop General Flynn's case since last August.
[01:12:56.267 --> 01:12:58.589]  And I just want to start by saying,
[01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:13.519]  And explaining why General Flynn's case and why Newsbutt has been non-stop covering this case of all the different angles and developments that we have been seeing, the force developments.
[01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:18.844]  I mean, isn't it the window into understanding the different factions and everything?
[01:13:18.844 --> 01:13:19.604]  Well, yes.
[01:13:20.726 --> 01:13:23.231]  As you know, I have been non-partisan.
[01:13:23.231 --> 01:13:25.956]  I have been around for 16 years, you just mentioned.
[01:13:25.956 --> 01:13:27.999]  I guess we are both getting really old, Alex.
[01:13:27.999 --> 01:13:29.402]  I can't believe we've been around this long.
[01:13:29.402 --> 01:13:30.203]  You look great.
[01:13:30.203 --> 01:13:31.466]  I don't know about me.
[01:13:33.871 --> 01:13:34.771]  No, you do.
[01:13:34.771 --> 01:13:36.412]  And you still have the energy.
[01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:44.975]  And again, this is, I don't know, the seventh or eighth time you have given us the platform to put out blacked out stories.
[01:13:44.975 --> 01:13:50.217]  And the documented stories, not allegations, not sensationalism.
[01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:54.919]  But here's why General Flynn's case grabbed my attention.
[01:13:55.561 --> 01:13:58.242]  Uh, starting last August, okay?
[01:13:58.242 --> 01:14:00.964]  As you know, I was a whistleblower with the FBI.
[01:14:00.964 --> 01:14:08.507]  I became the most gagged whistleblower, uh, with all the state secrets, privilege, invocations, and the gag orders.
[01:14:08.507 --> 01:14:13.869]  This, this came during the Bush administration, and it continued into Obama administration.
[01:14:13.869 --> 01:14:17.151]  As you know, the Supreme Court was prevented from hearing my case.
[01:14:18.211 --> 01:14:34.641]  Well, when I started looking at all the facts on General Flynn's case, the first thing I realized immediately, because I also have an organization, I have 150 national security whistleblowers from the CIA, from the Pentagon,
[01:14:35.081 --> 01:14:37.162]  We established this organization in 2003, 2004.
[01:14:37.162 --> 01:14:45.486]  And that's why I'm saying you have so much courage, is you have been a leading person when they were jailing everybody who stood up to them and organized folks.
[01:14:45.486 --> 01:14:53.490]  And so much of what we now know about 9-11 and all these other events that helped General Flynn finally break a lot of this up was due to your work.
[01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:57.512]  And I'm only explaining that to listeners so they understand how incredibly important this is.
[01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:07.510]  Extremely important, because as you can see, unanimously, the media, they don't present the real case when it comes to General Flynn's case.
[01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:15.693]  General Flynn was selected by the Obama administration to lead Defense Intelligence Agency.
[01:15:15.693 --> 01:15:20.555]  They looked at this general impeccable, impeccable record, right?
[01:15:20.555 --> 01:15:25.397]  And I have to also emphasize, he has been, he and his family has, they have been Democrats.
[01:15:26.718 --> 01:15:32.362]  So, do you expect that also to have a yes man in the White House?
[01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:39.866]  They got a hero who helped the whole engineer, the whole architecture to stop the Islamic Jihad operations.
[01:15:39.866 --> 01:15:40.346]  Stay right there.
[01:15:40.346 --> 01:15:47.231]  Let's get into why the globalists hate General Flynn so much and how it's a window into everything with Sabel Edmonds straight ahead.
[01:15:47.231 --> 01:15:48.471]  She's with News Bud.
[01:15:48.471 --> 01:15:48.832]  Stay with us.

[01:20:25.564 --> 01:20:31.588]  By the way, this particular article ties into what Sebel is about to break down exclusively here.
[01:20:31.588 --> 01:20:38.954]  This came out six months ago in the Vault 7 CIA leak, but they admit it was real info, how they were impersonating Russians.
[01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:50.878]  ...with the CIA programs in live time to make it look like it came from Russia and to put it in the Russian alphabet to then frame Russia for messing with the election.
[01:20:50.878 --> 01:20:57.920]  So there it is, CIA wrote code to impersonate Russia, lab, antivirus company, just so much more.
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.141]  Putin says deep state may interfere in Russian election.
[01:21:00.141 --> 01:21:04.302]  Well, they've been doing it with the whole Ford Foundation and the CIA.
[01:21:05.362 --> 01:21:07.444]  George Soros, it's just crazy.
[01:21:07.444 --> 01:21:17.511]  But going back to Sybil Edmonds, one of the biggest whistleblowers, if not the most prolific ever, organizing other whistleblowers now with Newsbud.com.
[01:21:17.511 --> 01:21:18.691]  Okay, you've got the floor.
[01:21:18.691 --> 01:21:24.976]  Let's get into General Flynn and why he's the key to understanding the shadow government wars that are going on.
[01:21:24.976 --> 01:21:26.737]  Absolutely.
[01:21:26.737 --> 01:21:32.041]  At Newsbud, we broke in 2011, before ISIS brand was created, Alex.
[01:21:32.594 --> 01:21:50.484]  The fact that Obama administration, the CIA, together with NATO, they were creating this this jihadi groups using Turkey, using Jordan, in order to topple Bashar Assad's government in Syria.
[01:21:50.484 --> 01:21:51.204]  Okay.
[01:21:51.204 --> 01:21:53.965]  And this was before they coined the term ISIS.
[01:21:53.965 --> 01:21:56.827]  And we have it there on our site, people can see it.
[01:21:56.827 --> 01:21:59.648]  Well, back to General Flynn.
[01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:00.429]  General Flynn,
[01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:11.132]  As an insider becomes aware, this is during the Obama administration, that this is what Obama administration was doing.
[01:22:11.132 --> 01:22:11.912]  The U.S.
[01:22:11.912 --> 01:22:24.195]  government was creating these jihadi groups, which later was termed ISIS, and he blew the whistle internally.
[01:22:24.195 --> 01:22:29.456]  He went and he's, think about it, he's a director of the Defense Intelligence Agency,
[01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:33.253]  He says, what the heck is this?
[01:22:33.253 --> 01:22:44.105]  And he stands out and he stands up against what the Obama administration was doing, opposes all these operations in creating ISIS.
[01:22:44.105 --> 01:22:45.247]  And here we are, U.S.
[01:22:45.247 --> 01:22:51.714]  government, Obama administration creating, arming, training ISIS in Turkey, in Jordan.
[01:22:52.572 --> 01:22:57.757]  And of course, by blowing the whistle, what is the first thing that's going to happen to you?
[01:22:57.757 --> 01:23:05.123]  I know it, and I know it based on hundreds of whistleblower cases I have represented, I have studied, I have analyzed.
[01:23:05.123 --> 01:23:12.789]  They pushed him out of the administration because he was not being a yes-man, okay?
[01:23:12.789 --> 01:23:15.872]  After leaving his position,
[01:23:16.892 --> 01:23:30.362]  General Flynn went and he said, you know, disgusted with the entire operations, Obama administration, and he set up his own private firm and some of the, with some clients, some of them international.
[01:23:30.362 --> 01:23:36.707]  And fast forward another year or so, he blew the whistle again.
[01:23:36.707 --> 01:23:39.889]  And this is for the American public.
[01:23:39.889 --> 01:23:42.731]  He is the first U.S.
[01:23:42.731 --> 01:23:46.594]  official to go on record unabashedly
[01:23:47.248 --> 01:23:56.775]  Exposing the world's biggest, biggest sleeper terror cell that is headquartered here in the United States.
[01:23:56.775 --> 01:23:58.316]  This is Fetullah Gulen.
[01:23:58.316 --> 01:24:07.503]  This is this Islamist radical Fetullah Gulen's network, which network is over $25 billion.
[01:24:07.503 --> 01:24:12.286]  Guess who brought Fetullah Gulen and his network into the United States?
[01:24:13.139 --> 01:24:31.467]  In 1998, it was Bill Clinton who brought Fethullah Gulen in a private Gulfstream plane, CIA plane, into the United States while this man was wanted in Turkey and even some other nations for his terror-radical Islamic activities.
[01:24:32.495 --> 01:24:39.001]  And Bill Clinton administration gave the rise to this network in the United States.
[01:24:39.001 --> 01:24:42.164]  And by the way, tell folks how much taxpayer money he gets a year.
[01:24:42.164 --> 01:24:46.588]  I mean, they say he's worth as much as $200 billion.
[01:24:46.588 --> 01:24:47.689]  That's the minimum.
[01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:49.230]  That's the minimum, Alex.
[01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:51.212]  That's the known figures.
[01:24:51.212 --> 01:24:55.236]  Because can you believe this Islamic terror network?
[01:24:55.785 --> 01:25:00.810]  He owns and operates the largest charter school chains in the United States.
[01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:02.111]  And they get taxpayer money.
[01:25:02.111 --> 01:25:02.991]  Hundreds of billions.
[01:25:02.991 --> 01:25:04.032]  Absolutely.
[01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:04.933]  So here we are.
[01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:06.074]  This has all come out now.
[01:25:06.074 --> 01:25:07.976]  You're from Turkey's Extraction.
[01:25:07.976 --> 01:25:09.377]  You're an expert on this.
[01:25:09.377 --> 01:25:10.418]  Flynn blows the whistle.
[01:25:10.418 --> 01:25:12.740]  The military says we're not going to be Al Qaeda's air force.
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:13.761]  Rand Paul goes public.
[01:25:13.761 --> 01:25:15.182]  Senator Cruz goes public.
[01:25:15.182 --> 01:25:17.805]  So they change the name to ISIS to confuse people.
[01:25:18.585 --> 01:25:20.026]  And then now it's ongoing.
[01:25:20.026 --> 01:25:21.166]  Now we have the Arab Spring.
[01:25:21.166 --> 01:25:22.206]  We have Europe.
[01:25:22.206 --> 01:25:23.347]  We have the migrant crisis.
[01:25:23.347 --> 01:25:24.607]  Soros is running it.
[01:25:24.607 --> 01:25:26.148]  There's a globalist double-cross.
[01:25:26.148 --> 01:25:30.049]  Trump, from my research, is trying to continue Flynn's operation to kill this.
[01:25:30.049 --> 01:25:31.369]  Is that accurate?
[01:25:31.369 --> 01:25:32.170]  And where are we going?
[01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:34.230]  And tell us about Mueller.
[01:25:34.230 --> 01:25:47.855]  Yes, because he actually, and this is General Flynn, he wrote an article, editorial, and had it published at the Hill publication, basically calling what it is, warning the American public,
[01:25:48.368 --> 01:25:52.213]  And saying this terror network needs to be stopped.
[01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:54.856]  And that basically was the last straw.
[01:25:54.856 --> 01:26:05.230]  He had already become a target, a major target, a major hit with the CIA, with the Obama administration, by blowing the whistle on ISIS.
[01:26:06.041 --> 01:26:21.138]  This was the last straw by going public as this high-level general with impeccable record saying this is a terror network and that was when the real retaliation began to take place.
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:25.942]  You know who's in power, because you can't criticize them.
[01:26:25.942 --> 01:26:30.746]  We've just barely covered Gulan, and the hack attacks, all hell breaks loose.
[01:26:30.746 --> 01:26:35.169]  The mainstream media comes after us on other issues, and I've been contacted by high-level people.
[01:26:35.169 --> 01:26:40.233]  It was off-record, so I can't say who, and they said, listen, just drop the Gulan stuff.
[01:26:40.233 --> 01:26:41.314]  You can do whatever you want.
[01:26:41.314 --> 01:26:41.934]  Stop.
[01:26:41.934 --> 01:26:42.615]  Stop it.
[01:26:42.615 --> 01:26:48.219]  I've been actually threatened, and I, you know, that's why I know how much courage you've got, is, I mean, these people mean business.
[01:26:48.934 --> 01:26:53.581]  I have been receiving threats for over a decade because I was the first person in the U.S.
[01:26:53.581 --> 01:26:56.365]  to expose Gulen Network, Gulen's name.
[01:26:56.365 --> 01:27:02.473]  When I came out in 2006-2007 on Gulen, nobody had heard of this man's name.
[01:27:02.473 --> 01:27:03.254]  They were like, who?
[01:27:03.254 --> 01:27:05.858]  She's talking about some kind of a Turkish Imam.
[01:27:06.328 --> 01:27:10.870]  Who was in Pennsylvania, and nobody wanted to take it seriously.
[01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:21.013]  But when you have this general with this impeccable record, going on record and publicly... Who was the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, so he had the bird's eye view of everything.
[01:27:21.013 --> 01:27:22.534]  He could see it.
[01:27:22.534 --> 01:27:22.874]  Right.
[01:27:22.874 --> 01:27:25.955]  And this is before Obama left the White House.
[01:27:25.955 --> 01:27:28.696]  This is November 2016.
[01:27:28.696 --> 01:27:34.138]  Three, four days after this article was published, penned by General Flynn,
[01:27:34.873 --> 01:27:54.313]  Obama White House started leaking falsified information, misleading, incomplete information, falsified to their mouthpiece media networks on General Flynn, accusing him of being pocketed by the Turkish government and none of those.
[01:27:54.833 --> 01:28:05.498]  Basically, most of those allegations have already been... Sure, Flynn 100% with his consulting company, carried out US interests 100% like he's always done, and done a great job.
[01:28:05.498 --> 01:28:10.900]  The whole architecture of bringing down ISIS, making Saudi Arabia stop doing what they're doing, I mean, that's Flynn, isn't it?
[01:28:12.043 --> 01:28:12.824]  Absolutely.
[01:28:12.824 --> 01:28:14.045]  And guess what?
[01:28:14.045 --> 01:28:21.453]  When I was in the FBI, there were several investigations on ULAND taken up by the FBI, okay?
[01:28:21.453 --> 01:28:29.802]  And several field offices, including those in New Jersey, those in Illinois, and of course the main office being the Washington Field Office.
[01:28:29.802 --> 01:28:32.605]  And this is under Director Mueller, right?
[01:28:33.266 --> 01:28:35.967]  And when we come back, we're going to hold you to the end of the hour because it's so important.
[01:28:35.967 --> 01:28:39.549]  We're going to get into Mueller now, who's just got his hands in uranium.
[01:28:39.549 --> 01:28:45.111]  One, the Russia deals, working with Gulan, and it's all on record just what a monster this guy is.
[01:28:45.111 --> 01:28:50.673]  And if this gets out, it could stop Mueller trying to destroy our chance of saving this country.
[01:28:50.673 --> 01:28:52.454]  We've got to stop Mueller.
[01:28:52.454 --> 01:28:52.814]  Stay with us.
[01:28:55.936 --> 01:29:01.060]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.

[01:29:29.032 --> 01:29:37.073]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[01:33:12.936 --> 01:33:16.557]  Who are the masters of the puppets?
[01:33:16.557 --> 01:33:21.539]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:33:21.539 --> 01:33:24.179]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.179 --> 01:33:39.244]  The Edmonds, probably the most prolific modern whistleblower, organized hundreds of other whistleblowers, broke federal gag orders to expose the 28 pages, Saudi involvement, the 9-11 stand down, the globalists allied with radical Islam out of Saudi Arabia.
[01:33:40.549 --> 01:33:56.233]  I know her information helped General Flynn with his inside information come to a lot of decisions General Flynn made and I'm only pointing that out to say we wouldn't be where we are right now without people like William Binning and her and William Drake or Thomas Drake all the rest of these folks.
[01:33:56.233 --> 01:34:06.156]  Now before I go any further just briefly because we're in a 34 hour broadcast right now that ends at 6 o'clock tonight.
[01:34:08.439 --> 01:34:10.480]  I need to be able to fund our operation.
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:12.101]  I'm not going to belabor this.
[01:34:12.101 --> 01:34:27.967]  We have great supplements, great fluoride-free toothpaste, we have great t-shirts, we have great books, we have great films, we have amazing water filtration, amazing air filtration, whatever the best systems are, according to Consumer Reports, at a good price.
[01:34:27.967 --> 01:34:28.488]  We get it.
[01:34:28.488 --> 01:34:29.168]  We discount it.
[01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:40.313]  And quite frankly, I'm so sick of Amazon, and all the government financing it gets, and the monopoly it's being given, and all the subsidies, that I try to give them a run for their money.
[01:34:40.313 --> 01:34:46.394]  I mean, we sell a lot of stuff lower than they do, and it's pretty crazy, because sometimes we're making $5 on things.
[01:34:46.394 --> 01:34:50.776]  Some of the products we've got out right now, it's Lost Leaders, because I want you to try them and see how great they are.
[01:34:50.776 --> 01:34:57.397]  Two of the Lost Leaders, with free shipping store-wide right now, are the Biome Defense Probiotic.

[01:35:13.748 --> 01:35:15.610]  Write down to Trump's my president.
[01:35:15.610 --> 01:35:16.971]  Write down to Hillary for prison 2017.

[01:35:31.446 --> 01:35:33.707]  We lose money on that one, but I want you to try it.
[01:35:33.707 --> 01:35:37.069]  DNA Force back in stock after months of being sold out.
[01:35:37.069 --> 01:35:37.810]  25% off with free shipping.
[01:35:37.810 --> 01:35:38.910]  You cannot beat that.
[01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:41.272]  So important for yourself, your children, your family.
[01:35:41.272 --> 01:35:44.454]  It's been proven to detoxify cells with the BioPQ Cube.
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:46.701]  The CoQ10 and others.
[01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:51.084]  It is the best product out there at one-third the cost of stuff sold in medical clinics.
[01:35:51.084 --> 01:35:53.445]  So that's our true nutraceutical level product.
[01:35:53.445 --> 01:35:58.649]  Infowarslive.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:58.649 --> 01:36:02.431]  And if you sign up for auto shipping, an additional 10% off.
[01:36:02.431 --> 01:36:04.833]  Again, free shipping is running, but I've got it in that
[01:36:05.967 --> 01:36:14.978]  I'm gonna end free shipping tomorrow, and I'm gonna end these specials tomorrow, and I really am, because a lot of them are lost leaders.
[01:36:14.978 --> 01:36:19.123]  And these are best-selling products, but I know a lot of you are on the fence and have never bought the products.
[01:36:19.986 --> 01:36:27.313]  Our regular customers are amazing, but I want people that haven't tried X2, or haven't tried BrainForce, or haven't tried what vitamin B12 does.
[01:36:27.313 --> 01:36:29.555]  Way more energy than a cup of coffee at night if I'm tired.
[01:36:29.555 --> 01:36:31.317]  And it's all healthy and it's good!
[01:36:31.317 --> 01:36:36.982]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:36.982 --> 01:36:41.827]  And you've seen the Congressional hearings last week, and the Intelligence Committee, saying we want InfoWars shut down.
[01:36:41.827 --> 01:36:44.029]  And the head of Twitter says, sir, we shut them down at lunch.
[01:36:45.794 --> 01:36:57.211]  We were just pointing out that they're bringing in these Islamic terrorists, they're protecting them, and that de Blasio had been soft on terror, and that Trump was right, and they called that a fake story, it was number one on Twitter, and banned it!
[01:36:58.345 --> 01:37:00.746]  I mean, this is like really dangerous.
[01:37:00.746 --> 01:37:05.769]  Gagging whistleblower, SWAT teaming William Binney, SWAT teaming Manafort.
[01:37:05.769 --> 01:37:14.353]  You know, they're trying to put Flynn, they've got a sealed indictment on him, but they're afraid of what he may say about classified stuff.
[01:37:14.353 --> 01:37:15.953]  This is real brinksmanship.
[01:37:15.953 --> 01:37:19.815]  And then Mueller comes into the situation.
[01:37:19.815 --> 01:37:23.417]  Mueller, let's talk about some of his background, Sabel Edmonds.
[01:37:23.417 --> 01:37:25.798]  You were in the FBI when he was the director of it.
[01:37:26.701 --> 01:37:41.071]  Yes, and this, I tell you what, what we are seeing here, it basically makes McCartyism era light, because this is like a souped up McCartyism right now we are seeing, witnessing.
[01:37:41.071 --> 01:37:51.859]  Imagine my shock when I saw that Robert Mueller was appointed as the special counsel in this case, and Robert, the same Robert Mueller,
[01:37:52.523 --> 01:37:58.725]  Who during my case, he's the Robert Mueller who put gag orders in my case together with Attorney General Ashcroft.
[01:37:58.725 --> 01:38:00.985]  You remember all that, Alex.
[01:38:00.985 --> 01:38:10.688]  With all these FBI files and cases that Robert Mueller was covering up on Gulen, on Gulen's network.
[01:38:10.688 --> 01:38:12.689]  They were FBI agents.
[01:38:12.689 --> 01:38:21.151]  They were FBI agents not only in Washington's field office, but also in Chicago field office, in Patterson field office.
[01:38:22.382 --> 01:38:28.284]  Who were blowing the whistle on Mueller internally, saying he's quashing our investigations.
[01:38:28.854 --> 01:38:38.337]  He's taking these terrorism and criminal investigations on Gulen and his network, and he was transferring them into counterintelligence.
[01:38:38.337 --> 01:38:55.701]  And when I was the one who stepped outside the FBI, went to Congress, went to IG, it was again this same Mueller who invoked the state secrets privilege with Ashcroft, placed gag orders to protect, to protect this terrorist network.
[01:38:55.701 --> 01:38:57.562]  So imagine my shock when I see
[01:38:58.516 --> 01:39:01.177]  Lo and behold, it's Robert Mueller.
[01:39:01.177 --> 01:39:14.702]  And Robert Mueller dug and could not find a single thing on General Flynn, linking him in any way to any nefarious activities or operations with the Russians.
[01:39:14.702 --> 01:39:18.684]  So he expanded this farce investigation.
[01:39:18.684 --> 01:39:20.344]  Now to not maybe filing the right paperwork.
[01:39:20.344 --> 01:39:22.405]  And turned the Lucky Gate into Turkey Gate.
[01:39:22.405 --> 01:39:22.665]  Exactly.
[01:39:22.665 --> 01:39:23.426]  Yeah, Turkey Gate.
[01:39:24.746 --> 01:39:28.709]  When it comes to General Flynn, it's Turkeygate!
[01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:31.810]  And nobody in the media... Look, look.
[01:39:31.810 --> 01:39:37.013]  President Trump said, fine, go and do the investigation in a limited scope.
[01:39:37.013 --> 01:39:46.659]  Anything that had to do with so-called allegations on... But now it's moved on to Turkey and him consulting for the Turkish government on how to try to stop ISIS.
[01:39:46.659 --> 01:39:50.141]  I mean, it was totally legal, so it's amazing.
[01:39:51.478 --> 01:39:53.279]  And guess what?
[01:39:53.279 --> 01:39:55.140]  We know the left, the media.
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:59.682]  Recently we put out an exposé on the Young Turks at Newsbutt.
[01:39:59.682 --> 01:40:02.844]  You know they have changed motors operandi, Alex.
[01:40:02.844 --> 01:40:10.088]  Because it got so much publicity when foundations like Soros was directly funding them, right?
[01:40:10.088 --> 01:40:12.149]  So now the Clinton camp
[01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:16.293]  They get their allies, they have them set up shell companies.
[01:40:16.293 --> 01:40:18.515]  These are bogus shell companies.
[01:40:18.515 --> 01:40:26.262]  They funnel the money to the shell companies, private companies, and have the private companies funnel money to media organizations.
[01:40:26.262 --> 01:40:29.705]  Let's talk about the Young Turks, because for people that don't know... It's those Young Turks on this.
[01:40:29.705 --> 01:40:31.767]  They are just only one of these.
[01:40:31.767 --> 01:40:37.152]  One of these left media organizations who are now implementing the new modus operandi.
[01:40:38.012 --> 01:40:49.742]  And if you wonder why they're all so pro-Hillary and are covering up everything, it's because they're paid by Hillary and paid by different Islamic... And shell companies created so they can have Hillary Camp's money funneled.
[01:40:49.742 --> 01:40:54.626]  They got $10 million from this company, from this fake shell company.
[01:40:55.306 --> 01:40:59.271]  That was established three months before they gave $10 million to the Young Turks.
[01:40:59.271 --> 01:41:01.895]  This is how much money they're spending on her again.
[01:41:01.895 --> 01:41:10.145]  And again, the Young Turks are a Google-funded, controlled, Democratic Party, Soros-funded disinformation operation.
[01:41:12.948 --> 01:41:19.329]  Literally, they were in my YouTube in 30 seconds after they confronted me and I went on their show.
[01:41:19.329 --> 01:41:23.790]  They gave the orders and they shut down my YouTube themselves to show their power.
[01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:26.431]  They are literally in bed with Google.
[01:41:26.431 --> 01:41:27.311]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:41:27.311 --> 01:41:28.031]  And they have been.
[01:41:28.031 --> 01:41:32.912]  That guy, the buffoon, James Uyghur, has been after me since 2004.
[01:41:32.912 --> 01:41:34.412]  But back to the Flynn case.
[01:41:34.412 --> 01:41:38.093]  And I'm going to break two news pieces here on your show.
[01:41:38.815 --> 01:41:39.996]  It hasn't been out.
[01:41:39.996 --> 01:41:41.357]  Nobody has it.
[01:41:41.357 --> 01:41:43.458]  We have developed our own sources.
[01:41:43.458 --> 01:41:47.620]  With our very limited budget, we have been traveling, interviewing people.
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:53.203]  So I have two breaking news to break during this show.
[01:41:53.203 --> 01:42:06.051]  But Mueller, I can't believe not only the left media, Young Turks, all the ones funded by the Clinton camp Soros, but even the more conservative or so-called conservative media outlets
[01:42:06.371 --> 01:42:12.215]  They haven't touched this case with General Flynn, with Mueller's real conflict of interest.
[01:42:12.215 --> 01:42:27.106]  Yes, he has huge conflict of interest on Uranium One, which again, we were reporting on that two years ago during Malheur protests on Uranium One and Clinton Foundation and Mueller's role, but in this case,
[01:42:27.646 --> 01:42:36.073]  By going after Flynn, not finding anything else, trying to punish a whistleblower who blew the whistle as a whistleblower.
[01:42:36.073 --> 01:42:40.176]  Sure, it ought to be Obama and all of them in trouble for running Islamic State and Al Qaeda.
[01:42:40.176 --> 01:42:40.536]  Stay there.
[01:42:40.536 --> 01:42:43.798]  Let's come back again to the new breaking news on Mueller and more.
[01:42:43.798 --> 01:42:45.740]  And then I want to do one more little short segment.
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:51.864]  After that, getting into recapping all the stuff you exposed earlier, those intercepts back on 9-11.
[01:42:51.864 --> 01:42:53.466]  Sabel Edmonds is our guest.
[01:42:53.466 --> 01:42:54.887]  Check out her website, Newsbug.

[01:45:41.294 --> 01:45:45.137]  And when you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[01:45:45.137 --> 01:45:46.278]  It is an act of war.
[01:45:46.278 --> 01:45:48.299]  It is an act of standing up.
[01:45:48.299 --> 01:45:53.884]  When you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us, and then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.

[01:46:12.274 --> 01:46:16.959]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip
[01:46:17.059 --> 01:46:20.201]  Because we hold back a surplus for auto ship customers.
[01:46:20.201 --> 01:46:25.283]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:46:25.283 --> 01:46:31.386]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:46:31.386 --> 01:46:32.787]  Just go to InfoWareStore.com.

[01:47:18.052 --> 01:47:23.054]  Again, we're in the middle of a 34-hour broadcast that ends coming up at 6 o'clock p.m.
[01:47:23.054 --> 01:47:24.154]  this evening with Ellen Schreuer.
[01:47:24.154 --> 01:47:26.935]  Got a lot of surprise guests coming on, a lot more today.
[01:47:26.935 --> 01:47:40.639]  The big thing is, when you're watching us on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, you name it, they admit they're blocking when we become number one, it going to the front pages, and they're blocking people who are subscribers from seeing it.
[01:47:40.639 --> 01:47:46.921]  You have to hand-share it to get this information out, but we've come so far, we're beginning to win.
[01:47:48.208 --> 01:47:53.451]  We're forcing Google and Facebook and Twitter to admit they're censoring.
[01:47:53.451 --> 01:47:59.495]  We've talked to top telecommunications and antitrust lawyers as well as civil rights lawyers.
[01:47:59.495 --> 01:48:06.060]  Project Veritas video of the YouTube executive admitting they're censoring InfoWars and discriminating.
[01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:10.282]  Congressional hearings where Twitter and others admit to censoring us.
[01:48:10.282 --> 01:48:13.024]  They have the head of operations.
[01:48:13.024 --> 01:48:15.946]  Sir, we saw InfoWars number one at lunch.
[01:48:15.946 --> 01:48:16.967]  The head of Twitter.
[01:48:18.405 --> 01:48:21.306]  is on lunch blocking us.
[01:48:21.306 --> 01:48:21.907]  And what is it?
[01:48:21.907 --> 01:48:23.948]  It's stuff like you're seeing right now.
[01:48:23.948 --> 01:48:26.609]  They know we have the big guest on.
[01:48:26.609 --> 01:48:27.869]  They know we have William Binney on.
[01:48:27.869 --> 01:48:29.570]  They know we have the whistleblowers on.
[01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:32.651]  They know we're exposing all this.
[01:48:32.651 --> 01:48:36.253]  The FBI picked up a whistleblower we had on two days ago.
[01:48:36.253 --> 01:48:37.574]  He doesn't want his full name put out.
[01:48:37.574 --> 01:48:38.034]  I had him on.
[01:48:38.034 --> 01:48:40.595]  I know who he is.
[01:48:40.595 --> 01:48:44.617]  Formerly in Army Special Operations and now in a private capacity.
[01:48:45.962 --> 01:48:51.224]  About the civil war going on in the Middle East and how with Yemeni's war it's spilling over to the U.S.
[01:48:51.224 --> 01:48:52.524]  He didn't give out any classified info.
[01:48:52.524 --> 01:48:54.705]  He just gave as a citizen his analysis.
[01:48:54.705 --> 01:48:56.885]  The FBI grabbed him.
[01:48:56.885 --> 01:49:03.847]  So this isn't a soap opera where they're running and they're spies and then, oh, you're watching it and everybody makes a big deal out of it.
[01:49:03.847 --> 01:49:04.888]  This is just real.
[01:49:04.888 --> 01:49:05.348]  We're doing it.

[01:49:59.202 --> 01:50:04.744]  Thanks for defending the Republic and thanks for helping build the platform now that is fearless.
[01:50:04.744 --> 01:50:09.885]  But we're building an even bigger studio, hiring more crew, launching more syndicated TV and radio shows.
[01:50:09.885 --> 01:50:11.066]  We are all in.
[01:50:11.997 --> 01:50:17.680]  And the more they attack, the faster we grow and the faster we just accelerate to ramming speed.
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:19.281]  So it is on right now.
[01:50:19.281 --> 01:50:21.302]  We are not playing games.
[01:50:21.302 --> 01:50:25.144]  Sabel Edmonds, let's get into the two big breaking news pieces here.
[01:50:25.144 --> 01:50:31.587]  We have been experiencing the same kind of attacks by the Twitter.
[01:50:31.587 --> 01:50:34.929]  So they are really getting aggressive.
[01:50:35.427 --> 01:50:38.108]  We have been experiencing it with YouTube as well.
[01:50:38.108 --> 01:50:43.971]  It's just it amazes me how much monopoly the deep state has the other camp.
[01:50:43.971 --> 01:51:01.100]  And before I forget, I would like to mention that it is really disappointing how some of these attorneys, whether from the White House or even in this case with General Flynn's attorneys, they keep going in this defensive mode.
[01:51:01.733 --> 01:51:08.839]  Instead of really going in on offense because they have so much ammunition.
[01:51:08.839 --> 01:51:25.033]  I tell you what, what we have gathered, what we have put out there on Director Mueller, just the conflict of interest that is huge on Fed to Locke Ulan, on all the quashing of the facts that relates dates back to Clinton era.
[01:51:25.913 --> 01:51:35.059]  After getting to office in 2000-2001, they can use this information and have him step down.
[01:51:35.059 --> 01:51:42.243]  But it's really disappointing to see that they keep going into this defensive mode.
[01:51:42.243 --> 01:51:54.971]  Because I know of several veteran, highly decorated FBI agents, if subpoenaed, they would testify on how Robert Mueller
[01:51:55.776 --> 01:52:04.998]  Due to what he was doing as the director of the FBI, cannot preside as the special counsel in this case.
[01:52:04.998 --> 01:52:06.879]  It's a slam-dunk case.
[01:52:06.879 --> 01:52:08.419]  It's not allegation.
[01:52:08.419 --> 01:52:10.119]  It's documented.
[01:52:10.119 --> 01:52:11.060]  But I don't know.
[01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:12.160]  I don't know where they are.
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:14.760]  I don't know why they're going on defense mode.
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:17.041]  Because from what I'm seeing, the other camp
[01:52:17.601 --> 01:52:28.691]  Not only they have been going on this constant offensive, but on top of that, they have been leaking like thieves, but leaking misinformation.
[01:52:28.691 --> 01:52:29.712]  Lies!
[01:52:29.712 --> 01:52:31.794]  And here is one of my breaking news here.
[01:52:33.152 --> 01:52:50.227]  Some people involved with cases of General Flynn, because there are several cases they have concocted, none of them, none of them legitimate case, they have issued gag order and they are preventing them now from twinning, okay?
[01:52:50.227 --> 01:52:57.593]  That's one piece of information to tell you how much of one-sided power we are talking about here.
[01:52:57.593 --> 01:52:59.515]  They have been issuing gag orders
[01:53:00.944 --> 01:53:14.059]  On these people who are the targets of these investigations, and in this case, the General Flynn's case, you're looking at a completely wrongful case because there is nothing, there is not a single criminal case.
[01:53:14.059 --> 01:53:15.201]  Wow, so be clear on that.
[01:53:15.201 --> 01:53:17.523]  Specifically, who's been issued gag orders?
[01:53:18.904 --> 01:53:27.647]  Uh, I cannot right now name the individuals, but there have been people connected to the case who have been tweeting legitimate tweets.
[01:53:27.647 --> 01:53:32.328]  You're saying outside, outside of Manafort and his deputy because we know those gag orders were issued.
[01:53:32.328 --> 01:53:37.009]  Yes, outside, outside Manafort and his deputies, okay?
[01:53:37.009 --> 01:53:43.031]  Uh, this also applies even though no indictments, no arrest warrant has yet, you know, been served.
[01:53:43.431 --> 01:53:45.573]  That is simply amazing.
[01:53:45.573 --> 01:53:49.996]  Not only are they banning and blocking Roger Stone on Twitter, who they're accusing of being a Russian agent.
[01:53:49.996 --> 01:53:56.241]  I mean, they silenced you as they demonized you, and now we learn they've done it to, I guess you're saying Flynn.
[01:53:56.241 --> 01:53:58.903]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[01:53:58.903 --> 01:54:03.026]  How are you supposed to defend yourself against misinformation?
[01:54:03.026 --> 01:54:09.831]  We actually put out information and had people, some of these publications, retract information.
[01:54:09.831 --> 01:54:12.754]  One of them was this guy, this journalist, Chuck Ross.
[01:54:13.436 --> 01:54:26.646]  Who got the documents from the White House, this is Obama White House, in November 2016, before Obama left the White House, he was handed all these lies on General Flynn, he published
[01:54:27.626 --> 01:54:32.468]  After all the pressure from us and from some of the other sources, they retract.
[01:54:32.468 --> 01:54:33.989]  But you know how they retract?
[01:54:33.989 --> 01:54:35.210]  These little tiny funds.
[01:54:35.210 --> 01:54:35.670]  Exactly.
[01:54:35.670 --> 01:54:38.251]  Well, it's just like Comey lied and said he wasn't leaking info.
[01:54:38.251 --> 01:54:39.632]  Then it turned out he was the leaker.
[01:54:39.632 --> 01:54:42.173]  But he goes, oh, I gave it to another journalist.
[01:54:42.173 --> 01:54:43.634]  I gave it to a professor.
[01:54:43.634 --> 01:54:45.355]  Sabel Edmonds is our guest right now.
[01:54:45.355 --> 01:54:47.316]  AmazingNewsBud.com.
[01:54:47.316 --> 01:54:48.456]  Everybody's got to get this out.
[01:54:48.456 --> 01:54:49.897]  But what a bombshell.
[01:54:49.897 --> 01:54:51.298]  You were in the FBI.
[01:54:51.298 --> 01:54:53.319]  High level counterterrorism, as everybody knows.
[01:54:54.099 --> 01:55:04.025]  You're saying you have FBI sources who are ready to expose Mueller right now for his connections and conflicts of interest with the Gulan network or what other areas?
[01:55:05.486 --> 01:55:16.656]  For example, if subpoenaed, whether these FBI agents or myself, we can name the files, because they have multiple investigations on Ghulam dating back to 1999.
[01:55:16.656 --> 01:55:21.801]  Okay, this is the terrorist, radical terrorist, Mullah Fethullah Ghulam.
[01:55:21.801 --> 01:55:23.823]  And by the way, let's be clear, it was folks leaking info.
[01:55:23.823 --> 01:55:25.345]  By Bill Clinton.
[01:55:25.345 --> 01:55:25.745]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:27.981]  Yes.
[01:55:27.981 --> 01:55:35.427]  And white collar crime under terrorism investigations, under counterintelligence and espionage investigations since 1999.
[01:55:35.427 --> 01:55:43.774]  And it was Bill Clinton's Janet Reno's office that started quashing this information.
[01:55:43.774 --> 01:55:49.419]  And it was afterwards Robert Mueller who quashed this information.
[01:55:50.071 --> 01:56:00.863]  And now he's using what he did, okay, and this is General Flynn, by standing for the Americans' interests, against the terrorists' interests.
[01:56:00.863 --> 01:56:08.431]  Sure, we know the whole Saudi Arabia network, the globalists, are hooked in with Bush Senior, Obama, the Clintons, Mueller, they're all bag men making money.
[01:56:08.971 --> 01:56:12.634]  What is your intel on the raids and the shakeup in Saudi Arabia?
[01:56:12.634 --> 01:56:18.618]  Our intel is it's cutting off the globalist connections and power in Saudi Arabia they were using back here in the U.S.
[01:56:18.618 --> 01:56:21.660]  and that Trump is rolling up these networks.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:25.522]  We've been getting conflicting reports on that.
[01:56:25.522 --> 01:56:36.370]  I know there are some factions who are trying to link this to Iran, okay, and they want the after effects, let's call it aftershocks,
[01:56:36.929 --> 01:56:41.991]  Spill over into what's taking place and what's going to take place with Iran.
[01:56:41.991 --> 01:56:56.657]  I think it's a bit too early to tell, but we had a roundtable discussion at Newsbud about three, three and a half months ago, and that was one of the predictions I made because people were talking about the 28 pages.
[01:56:56.657 --> 01:56:59.518]  I said, Saudi Arabia is also on the list, you know.
[01:57:00.018 --> 01:57:07.620]  And we are going to have regime change there, or the window dressing regime change there.
[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:10.381]  It's too early to tell.
[01:57:10.381 --> 01:57:16.783]  But speaking of that, let me let your viewers, your listeners know about another breaking news.
[01:57:17.943 --> 01:57:18.484]  Stay right there.
[01:57:18.484 --> 01:57:22.826]  We'll be back in about a minute and a half with Sabel Edmonds for the other big breaking news.
[01:57:22.826 --> 01:57:26.488]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:57:26.488 --> 01:57:30.050]  We're in the middle of a 34-hour broadcast right now.
[01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:31.571]  Our regular show time is 11 a.m.
[01:57:31.571 --> 01:57:32.491]  to 3 p.m.
[01:57:32.491 --> 01:57:39.175]  Central, but we're in the middle of a 34-hour global transmission, the one-year anniversary of the Trump victory.
[01:57:39.175 --> 01:57:40.256]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:40.256 --> 01:57:40.696]  Stay with us.
[01:57:45.868 --> 01:58:05.863]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[01:58:05.863 --> 01:58:07.984]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[01:58:07.984 --> 01:58:11.967]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarstore.com.
[01:58:11.967 --> 01:58:13.008]  And I want to thank everybody that has.

[01:58:19.212 --> 01:58:21.594]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.

[01:58:24.235 --> 01:58:27.037]  That's my dad, with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[01:58:27.037 --> 01:58:29.759]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.

[01:58:38.725 --> 01:58:43.168]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:48.831]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:58:48.831 --> 01:58:50.151]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:58:50.151 --> 01:58:51.352]  Why is this so good?
[01:58:51.352 --> 01:58:56.654]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:58:56.654 --> 01:59:10.181]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:59:10.181 --> 01:59:11.542]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:59:12.322 --> 01:59:13.984]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:59:13.984 --> 01:59:16.546]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:59:16.546 --> 01:59:17.847]  These are all parasites.
[01:59:17.847 --> 01:59:18.948]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:59:18.948 --> 01:59:20.289]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:59:20.289 --> 01:59:24.793]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:59:24.793 --> 01:59:28.075]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:59:28.075 --> 01:59:31.158]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:59:31.158 --> 01:59:32.199]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:59:32.199 --> 01:59:34.120]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:35.161]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:59:35.161 --> 01:59:37.163]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:59:38.704 --> 01:59:39.745]  You support the broadcast.
[01:59:39.745 --> 01:59:41.106]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:59:41.106 --> 01:59:43.348]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:59:43.348 --> 01:59:49.574]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:59:49.574 --> 01:59:56.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:57.521]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:59:57.521 --> 01:59:59.723]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:24.068 --> 02:00:25.589]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:25.589 --> 02:00:26.749]  I'm your host.
[02:00:26.749 --> 02:00:34.572]  But the really cool thing is our amazing guests like Sybelle Edmonds, whistleblower, former FBI translator, journalist with Newsbud.com.
[02:00:34.572 --> 02:00:36.273]  We've got five minutes left.
[02:00:36.273 --> 02:00:37.173]  Intriguing.
[02:00:37.173 --> 02:00:44.116]  Please come back soon, but get into your other big breaking news and just the big picture of where the world is right now.
[02:00:44.116 --> 02:00:52.399]  Yes, and this whole case with Flynn was a setup to start with even before the creation of the special counsel.
[02:00:53.010 --> 02:01:01.855]  One of the rats in this case, and I'm going to call him a rat, has been James Woolsey, the former CIA director appointed by who?
[02:01:01.855 --> 02:01:03.816]  Bill Clinton.
[02:01:03.816 --> 02:01:15.763]  The Clinton camp and the Deep State, they actually tried, attempted, because nothing really came out of it, they tried to set up General Flynn.
[02:01:15.763 --> 02:01:18.605]  By having Woolsey, the former CIA director,
[02:01:19.471 --> 02:01:24.395]  Go and try to blend in with General Flynn's company, okay?
[02:01:24.395 --> 02:01:40.027]  Go and attend a meeting with him, then come out and go to Wall Street Journal and put out completely false information alleging that General Flynn is concocting a plan with some Turkish operatives
[02:01:40.598 --> 02:01:50.582]  To go in the United States, kidnap this terrorist, I hope somebody would do that, and extradite this man to Turkey, but that did not take place.
[02:01:50.582 --> 02:01:52.202]  That did not take place.
[02:01:52.202 --> 02:01:56.144]  And it was debunked, but you won't see that in the media.
[02:01:56.144 --> 02:02:09.089]  And James Woolsey, I mean this, I can't tell you what a rat this man is, he has been working with the Clinton camp, and now he's working with Mueller and the special counsel.
[02:02:10.117 --> 02:02:15.259]  Despite the fact that so much information has been put out, not by the U.S.
[02:02:15.259 --> 02:02:20.662]  mainstream media, on Woolsey and Woolsey's role with the Clinton camp.
[02:02:20.662 --> 02:02:30.106]  Now, before I break the news, this has been all made possible, all the work we have done on this, through public support, our viewer support.
[02:02:30.106 --> 02:02:32.227]  We don't get a penny from any foundations.
[02:02:32.227 --> 02:02:33.748]  We don't even run ads.
[02:02:33.748 --> 02:02:34.908]  We are 100% independent.
[02:02:34.908 --> 02:02:37.109]  And people should support you.
[02:02:37.109 --> 02:02:38.090]  People should support you.
[02:02:39.031 --> 02:02:42.914]  We truly, we truly depend on this support because we are tiny.
[02:02:42.914 --> 02:02:48.740]  We are these little ants and we are going against these, these elephants out there.
[02:02:48.740 --> 02:02:59.749]  We got information, inside information, that, you know, not only Flynn, but his family has come under retaliation and attack.
[02:02:59.749 --> 02:03:03.833]  And you know how President Trump wanted to clean this, you know, swamp
[02:03:04.887 --> 02:03:11.490]  In a way, I envy some of these countries where some of the dictator regimes, they can actually go and take out people.
[02:03:11.490 --> 02:03:23.715]  You know, when Erdogan has gotten rid of 5,000, 8,000 people, some of them may be wrongful, I'm not saying all legit, because he knows that they are connected to the devil's side, right?
[02:03:23.715 --> 02:03:30.158]  Well, with President Trump just firing Comey has been raising all these flags, even though Comey deserved
[02:03:30.718 --> 02:03:32.739]  And he deserved to be fired, okay?
[02:03:32.739 --> 02:03:35.841]  And he's still in, even though he's been fired.
[02:03:35.841 --> 02:03:48.888]  Now, the inside, okay, the same swamp, leftover swamp, they're in every agency, Alex, they are now retaliating against General Flynn's older brother.
[02:03:48.888 --> 02:03:53.850]  He is an honorable two-star general.
[02:03:53.850 --> 02:03:54.911]  He's
[02:03:55.405 --> 02:03:56.226]  Army General.
[02:03:56.226 --> 02:03:57.407]  He's in Honolulu.
[02:03:57.407 --> 02:03:58.928]  He is based there.
[02:03:58.928 --> 02:04:02.131]  He has impeccable record.
[02:04:02.131 --> 02:04:07.936]  And right now, the swamp operatives, they are now retaliating against him.
[02:04:07.936 --> 02:04:09.317]  Okay?
[02:04:09.317 --> 02:04:11.058]  Nobody has the speech.
[02:04:11.058 --> 02:04:13.040]  And I know you have the resources.
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:14.902]  I invite you to seek comments.
[02:04:14.902 --> 02:04:16.043]  Well, Sabel, this is so big.
[02:04:16.043 --> 02:04:16.984]  We've got to go to break.
[02:04:16.984 --> 02:04:18.064]  I have another guest coming to the studio.
[02:04:18.064 --> 02:04:20.687]  But do five more minutes, because you're giving us this exclusive.
[02:04:21.667 --> 02:04:28.893]  We know they're going after his son, but you're saying now they're going after his brother, who they admit has nothing to do with this?
[02:04:28.893 --> 02:04:29.453]  Yes!
[02:04:29.453 --> 02:04:32.956]  He is an amazing general with an amazing track record.
[02:04:32.956 --> 02:04:34.517]  He is based in Honolulu.
[02:04:34.517 --> 02:04:36.359]  He's an army general.
[02:04:36.359 --> 02:04:39.842]  And for the past few weeks, they've been going after him.
[02:04:39.842 --> 02:04:41.563]  They are trying to now set him up.
[02:04:41.563 --> 02:04:42.524]  Not with any of these.
[02:04:43.105 --> 02:04:43.606]  I don't know.
[02:04:55.185 --> 02:04:58.948]  My fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with a very important message.
[02:04:58.948 --> 02:05:04.172]  Secret 12, 40% off the best vitamin B12 out there from our research.
[02:05:04.172 --> 02:05:05.393]  I can't get it under the tongue.
[02:05:05.393 --> 02:05:06.354]  Simply amazing.
[02:05:06.354 --> 02:05:07.995]  That sale is continuing.
[02:05:07.995 --> 02:05:11.338]  Supermell Vitality for stamina, libido, energy.
[02:05:11.338 --> 02:05:12.379]  That's 30% off.
[02:05:12.379 --> 02:05:13.499]  That's continuing.
[02:05:13.499 --> 02:05:15.281]  And the other really, really good news.
[02:05:15.581 --> 02:05:25.265]  Uh, is that yes, we're having to end the sale of 50% off on Anthroplex, but DNA Force, after almost four months, out of stock, is back in stock.
[02:05:25.265 --> 02:05:27.226]  25% off our flagship product.
[02:05:27.226 --> 02:05:32.068]  Also, Biome Defense, the great probiotic, that is 25% off as well.
[02:05:32.068 --> 02:05:36.450]  So a lot of things are selling out, but a lot of things are still at record sales.
[02:05:36.450 --> 02:05:40.751]  Like Silver Bullet, super high quality colloidal silver is still 50% off.
[02:05:40.751 --> 02:05:44.513]  And there's other sales that are still going, but they're all about to end.
[02:05:44.853 --> 02:05:51.495]  Whether it's DNA Force, or whether it's Silver Bullet, it's all available right now at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:05:51.495 --> 02:06:09.120]  Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[02:06:19.082 --> 02:06:24.178]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:06:31.038 --> 02:06:39.343]  Shepard Ambellist is with us in the hour talking about Vegas and the Texas shooting and we're going to get into some of the background on that.
[02:06:39.343 --> 02:06:50.209]  But Sabelle Edmonds, amazing whistleblower, former FBI translator, very, very famous for her work organizing whistleblowers, very, very valiant, violating in a good way federal gag orders, exposing.
[02:06:51.374 --> 02:06:56.200]  Saudi Connections, 9-11, that have now been completely vindicated, and more.
[02:06:56.200 --> 02:07:01.386]  You were getting into General Flynn's brother, who we never hear about, another two-star general.
[02:07:01.386 --> 02:07:05.692]  Tell us about what's happening there with these recriminations in this deep state war.
[02:07:07.295 --> 02:07:12.941]  As I said before, the family and the attorneys, they are under pressure.
[02:07:12.941 --> 02:07:25.153]  There has been issues of gag orders, including applying specifically to Twitter activities of anybody who's trying to speak up and try to raise awareness and trying to put the truth out there.
[02:07:25.951 --> 02:07:32.952]  And his older brother, General Flynn's older brother, Charles, General Charles A. Flynn.
[02:07:32.952 --> 02:07:35.873]  Again, he is another decorated general.
[02:07:35.873 --> 02:07:38.914]  I invite people to go and check his background.
[02:07:38.914 --> 02:07:44.455]  I'm talking about the entire family.
[02:07:44.455 --> 02:07:50.756]  They are all suffering the consequences of General Flynn doing the right thing.
[02:07:51.354 --> 02:07:57.477]  Standing up against terrorism, creation of ISIS during the Obama administration.
[02:07:57.477 --> 02:08:05.561]  Exposing the largest sleeper terror cell in the United States, Betulah Gulen's network.
[02:08:05.561 --> 02:08:07.442]  It's a payback time.
[02:08:07.442 --> 02:08:12.545]  They are retaliating not only against him, but also against his family, including
[02:08:13.277 --> 02:08:15.582]  General Charles A. Flynn.
[02:08:15.582 --> 02:08:18.388]  Okay, so nobody has covered this.
[02:08:18.388 --> 02:08:23.138]  Nobody knows about this as we know there are some other gag orders in the work here.
[02:08:24.295 --> 02:08:31.678]  As far as the media goes, they have done nothing but putting out false information, incomplete information.
[02:08:31.678 --> 02:08:34.239]  We have had several in-depth videos.
[02:08:34.239 --> 02:08:35.620]  We went to New York.
[02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:46.524]  We interviewed some of these Turkish people that the media and Mueller and everyone is accusing of funneling money to General Flynn.
[02:08:46.524 --> 02:08:47.885]  We interviewed them.
[02:08:47.885 --> 02:08:53.207]  We are the only ones who have had exclusive interviews with these people, okay?
[02:08:54.358 --> 02:08:57.460]  General Flynn didn't work for the Turkish government.
[02:08:57.460 --> 02:09:05.706]  There was a Turkish private company that actually had a contract with General Flynn's legitimate company.
[02:09:05.706 --> 02:09:14.112]  This is after he was kicked out of Obama administration for blowing the whistle on Obama administration creating ISIS.
[02:09:15.143 --> 02:09:24.827]  And if that company has some on-the-side association with the Turkish government, that had nothing to do with the contract of this private business.
[02:09:24.827 --> 02:09:27.568]  Legitimate contract with General Flynn.
[02:09:27.568 --> 02:09:29.088]  It's payback time.
[02:09:29.088 --> 02:09:33.910]  It's the payback time and it involves former CIA Director James Woolsey,
[02:09:34.924 --> 02:09:35.625]  I think?
[02:09:48.430 --> 02:09:51.491]  We let him establish this terror organization.
[02:09:51.491 --> 02:09:55.352]  Now their net worth is 25 plus billion dollars.
[02:09:55.352 --> 02:10:00.213]  They operate the largest charter school chain in the United States.
[02:10:00.213 --> 02:10:03.454]  They have been given immunity by the Clintons.
[02:10:03.454 --> 02:10:15.778]  In fact, if you watch our videos, we have a video of Bill Clinton, President Bill Clinton, saying, Betulah Gulen is not only my friend, he is my wife, Hillary's best friend, okay?
[02:10:17.150 --> 02:10:24.871]  You're looking at the world's largest terror sales head being the best friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[02:10:24.871 --> 02:10:25.271]  U.N.
[02:10:25.271 --> 02:10:38.174]  Foundations and their other umbrella shell network organizations here in the U.S., they have given millions of dollars to Clinton Foundation during the time when Bill Clinton was the Secretary of State.
[02:10:38.174 --> 02:10:45.735]  Sure, and Sabel Edmonds, you are a former FBI translator, a major whistleblower, so much we know about 9-11, this thanks to you, total credibility here.
[02:10:47.599 --> 02:10:52.504]  My issue in closing is this.
[02:10:52.504 --> 02:10:57.148]  Think about how 15, 16 years ago you were exposing government connections to Al Qaeda.
[02:10:57.148 --> 02:10:58.509]  Back then that was unknown.
[02:10:58.509 --> 02:10:59.610]  Now it's everywhere.
[02:10:59.610 --> 02:11:01.091]  It's confirmed.
[02:11:01.091 --> 02:11:03.513]  It's talked about in Congress.
[02:11:03.513 --> 02:11:05.415]  John McCain's deeply involved.
[02:11:05.415 --> 02:11:07.057]  And no one's gotten in trouble.
[02:11:07.057 --> 02:11:12.201]  And the patriots that blew the whistle, we're the ones being persecuted.
[02:11:12.201 --> 02:11:14.063]  But the good news is the information's now out.
[02:11:16.052 --> 02:11:24.834]  Well, I hope, I hope again, I'm hoping, I'm really hoping, hoping that White House attorneys, General Flynn's attorneys are watching this.
[02:11:24.834 --> 02:11:31.716]  General Flynn is not only protected by the facts, the real truth, but he's also protected as a whistleblower!
[02:11:31.716 --> 02:11:42.258]  Sure, I know he watches and listens to the show, so, I mean, I don't know if you've communicated with him before, but if you'd like to get a message to him, if they're not watching live, they'll hear about it, so go ahead and give your advice.
[02:11:42.258 --> 02:11:45.139]  It is, not only he's protected by the facts,
[02:11:45.678 --> 02:11:48.900]  on his side, but also as a whistleblower.
[02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:57.805]  He is covered by whistleblower, even though it's not very strong, the whistleblower laws, the so-called laws we have, he's even covered by that, okay?
[02:11:57.805 --> 02:12:09.853]  And it is absolutely mind-boggling how the attorneys, both for the White House, and in this case, with General Flynn... How they're whims, because they don't want to get in trouble themselves.
[02:12:09.853 --> 02:12:14.876]  Okay, you know how we have traditional warfare style, asymmetric warfare style?
[02:12:15.516 --> 02:12:16.757]  Non-traditional.
[02:12:16.757 --> 02:12:18.438]  Same thing applies to legalese.
[02:12:18.438 --> 02:12:19.419]  This is political.
[02:12:19.419 --> 02:12:20.259]  I understand it's political.
[02:12:20.259 --> 02:12:20.780]  It has to be different.
[02:12:20.780 --> 02:12:21.120]  That's right.
[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:23.222]  In this case, they are not playing.
[02:12:23.222 --> 02:12:25.043]  They are not playing by the rule.
[02:12:25.043 --> 02:12:29.026]  This special counsel with conflict of interest, okay?
[02:12:29.026 --> 02:12:32.648]  With this concocted case the entire Russia gave farce.
[02:12:32.648 --> 02:12:33.869]  I know, and that's what Trump keeps saying.
[02:12:33.869 --> 02:12:38.632]  Trump keeps saying... But his attorneys, Alex, they want to fight it the traditional way.
[02:12:38.632 --> 02:12:40.974]  That's why they have been losing so far.
[02:12:40.974 --> 02:12:41.875]  They have to just...
[02:12:42.695 --> 02:12:44.297]  It's time for the gloves to come off!
[02:12:44.297 --> 02:12:45.017]  No, no, I agree.
[02:12:45.017 --> 02:12:48.460]  That's how you beat these political persecutions is you make it political.
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:49.801]  You go right back at the juggler.
[02:12:49.801 --> 02:12:52.103]  In closing, and we'll have you back soon.
[02:12:52.103 --> 02:12:52.783]  I appreciate your time.
[02:12:52.783 --> 02:12:54.525]  Let me throw this at you.
[02:12:54.525 --> 02:12:55.345]  The 35,000 foot view.
[02:12:55.345 --> 02:12:57.507]  We've been getting the up close view five feet away.
[02:12:57.507 --> 02:12:59.809]  35,000 foot view.
[02:12:59.809 --> 02:13:04.533]  It looks like Trump is exposing the globalist networks where the radical jihadis is rolling them up.
[02:13:04.533 --> 02:13:07.355]  He's doing a lot of things that have the deep state really angry at him.
[02:13:07.355 --> 02:13:09.637]  What is your view one year in of Trump so far?
[02:13:12.157 --> 02:13:13.739]  Well, here is the deal.
[02:13:13.739 --> 02:13:23.051]  I know they had set some objectives, and some of those objectives were the main reason that even so many Democrats I knew, they ended up voting TrumpCamp.
[02:13:23.051 --> 02:13:25.915]  I didn't vote for anyone, so let me just come clean on this.
[02:13:26.656 --> 02:13:38.140]  But what they have done with this distraction, with this farce, which they are pushing and they are gaining momentum for this farce thing leading to impeachment, that is the most dangerous part about this thing.
[02:13:38.140 --> 02:13:40.501]  This is why Mueller has to step down.
[02:13:40.501 --> 02:13:51.105]  They haven't given anyone any opportunity to do anything when they are so bogged down with this farce using hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money.
[02:13:51.105 --> 02:13:53.186]  Sure, the attempt to relaunch America.
[02:13:53.706 --> 02:14:04.856]  We're interfering with the country's economy, with the fight, the real fight, not the fake fight against terror, because look at the media, everything is on this.
[02:14:04.856 --> 02:14:06.718]  Look what is happening globally.
[02:14:06.718 --> 02:14:09.280]  We are losing allies after allies.
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:11.842]  They are going into other camps, including Russia camps.
[02:14:11.842 --> 02:14:13.103]  Do you know why?
[02:14:13.103 --> 02:14:16.006]  Because of what Obama's foreign policy did.
[02:14:16.006 --> 02:14:20.130]  That was another major point that General Flynn blew the whistle on.
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:24.185]  Because Obama turned our foreign policy into disaster.
[02:14:24.185 --> 02:14:27.870]  Look at the attempted coup in Turkey, Alex.
[02:14:27.870 --> 02:14:31.054]  Obama's attempted coup in Turkey, okay?
[02:14:31.054 --> 02:14:35.159]  It was Obama's attempted coup with the CIA in Turkey.
[02:14:35.159 --> 02:14:36.822]  Look what he, the mess he made.
[02:14:37.302 --> 02:14:39.164]  We don't have a chance to clean it up.
[02:14:39.164 --> 02:14:39.945]  No, I understand.
[02:14:39.945 --> 02:14:45.352]  We've got globalists wrecking the country, trying to impeach the president before he can relaunch the nation.
[02:14:45.352 --> 02:14:46.213]  It's true treason.
[02:14:46.213 --> 02:14:48.095]  They're the globalists that sold the nation out.
[02:14:48.095 --> 02:14:49.336]  I'm glad you're on fire.
[02:14:49.336 --> 02:14:51.559]  Amazing information.
[02:14:51.559 --> 02:14:53.361]  Sabel Edmonds with Newsbud.com.
[02:14:53.361 --> 02:14:54.062]  Thank you so much.
[02:14:54.062 --> 02:14:54.763]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:14:55.532 --> 02:15:00.658]  Many thanks, Alex, and we are counting on your viewers' support as well, and I will be back anytime you wish.
[02:15:00.658 --> 02:15:02.901]  Thank you for providing us with the platform.
[02:15:02.901 --> 02:15:07.286]  You're the only, only major outlet, alternative outlet that has done that.
[02:15:07.286 --> 02:15:07.747]  Thank you.
[02:15:07.747 --> 02:15:08.308]  Well, thank you.
[02:15:08.308 --> 02:15:10.410]  Well, we're all in this together, and she's dead on.
[02:15:10.410 --> 02:15:12.273]  Thank you, Isabel Evans.
[02:15:12.273 --> 02:15:13.734]  This all ties together because...
[02:15:15.154 --> 02:15:27.103]  The evidence is mounting of a Saudi civil war spilling over and an arms deal, and that being what happened in Mandalay Bay back on October 1st, 39 days ago, or 40 days ago.
[02:15:27.103 --> 02:15:31.166]  And Chevron Ambulance has been breaking it down at intelhub.com.
[02:15:31.166 --> 02:15:33.348]  We're going to look at that and tie it into the Texas shooting.
[02:15:34.048 --> 02:15:35.810]  Uh, which, I mean, mind control?
[02:15:35.810 --> 02:15:36.310]  Give me a break.
[02:15:36.310 --> 02:15:39.473]  The guy's in a mental institution trying to kill a chain of command.
[02:15:39.473 --> 02:15:40.694]  He escapes.
[02:15:40.694 --> 02:15:41.815]  No APBs put out.
[02:15:41.815 --> 02:15:43.116]  He's allowed to get guns.
[02:15:43.116 --> 02:15:44.157]  They don't even file a report.
[02:15:44.157 --> 02:15:45.999]  He's been dishonorably discharged.
[02:15:45.999 --> 02:15:51.364]  I mean, either it's the worst negligence ever, or this was some wind-up toy they had sitting on the sidelines ready.
[02:15:51.364 --> 02:15:52.024]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:52.024 --> 02:15:52.425]  Stay with us.
[02:15:54.116 --> 02:15:56.017]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:15:56.017 --> 02:15:59.239]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[02:15:59.239 --> 02:16:00.841]  Savory and delicious.
[02:16:00.841 --> 02:16:03.662]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[02:16:03.662 --> 02:16:04.323]  Awesome.
[02:16:04.323 --> 02:16:07.425]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[02:16:07.425 --> 02:16:08.986]  NASA PAC Technology.
[02:16:08.986 --> 02:16:09.606]  Bacon.
[02:16:09.606 --> 02:16:13.769]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[02:16:13.769 --> 02:16:15.190]  Or warm and served.

[02:16:25.297 --> 02:16:27.098]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:16:27.098 --> 02:16:28.740]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:31.562]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:16:31.562 --> 02:16:33.864]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.

[02:16:53.945 --> 02:16:55.907]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:16:55.907 --> 02:17:01.211]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:17:01.211 --> 02:17:02.793]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:17:02.793 --> 02:17:11.160]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:17:21.107 --> 02:17:25.510]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.

[02:17:55.825 --> 02:17:58.968]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:17:58.968 --> 02:18:06.393]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullies.
[02:18:06.393 --> 02:18:12.018]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:18:12.738 --> 02:18:20.449]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:18:20.449 --> 02:18:28.300]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:34.103]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[02:18:34.103 --> 02:18:36.245]  They are the anti-liberals.
[02:18:36.245 --> 02:18:49.613]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:19:57.286 --> 02:19:59.967]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:11.476 --> 02:20:12.017]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:20:12.017 --> 02:20:14.504]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.825 --> 02:20:22.946]  Now, I've known Shepard Ambitliss a good 10 years.
[02:20:22.946 --> 02:20:25.308]  He's a documentary filmmaker on jonesilove.com.
[02:20:25.308 --> 02:20:32.613]  There's a lot of really in-depth, original, thought-provoking research into these big events where we never get even an official story.
[02:20:32.613 --> 02:20:35.275]  They just, nowadays, they just say, we don't know what happened.
[02:20:35.275 --> 02:20:36.616]  Vegas, Texas, all of it.
[02:20:36.616 --> 02:20:39.217]  And then, oh, he was disarmed by discharge.
[02:20:39.217 --> 02:20:41.179]  We go, well, under federal law, he can't own a gun.
[02:20:41.179 --> 02:20:42.500]  Can't buy one.
[02:20:42.500 --> 02:20:44.081]  And they go, oh, he was in a mental institution.
[02:20:44.081 --> 02:20:46.983]  He tried to kill his command and came with a gun to murder everybody.
[02:20:46.983 --> 02:20:50.185]  And then when he escaped, they didn't put an APB out and didn't
[02:20:51.866 --> 02:20:54.227]  I mean that is either the worst negligence ever
[02:21:20.905 --> 02:21:22.526]  Fits the bill.
[02:21:22.526 --> 02:21:26.408]  This guy fits the bill of a staged event.
[02:21:26.408 --> 02:21:28.349]  Again, why would they do that, though, Shepard?
[02:21:28.349 --> 02:21:29.630]  I mean, what's your view?
[02:21:29.630 --> 02:21:33.692]  Well, you know, it could be anything, Alex, at this point.
[02:21:33.692 --> 02:21:35.733]  Everything's up to speculation, really.
[02:21:35.733 --> 02:21:40.655]  But just like default, Hassan was a psychiatrist, perfectly, in the mental institution system.
[02:21:42.256 --> 02:21:43.837]  Again, they stood down.
[02:21:43.837 --> 02:21:50.762]  When you take a look at all these guys, the Aurora theater shooter, the Batman shooter... He was in a secret government program, that's admitted.
[02:21:50.762 --> 02:21:53.223]  You look at... Human brain interface NASA.
[02:21:53.223 --> 02:21:55.645]  Most classified human brain interfaces there are.
[02:21:55.645 --> 02:21:58.947]  His dad's a top mathematician in mind control.
[02:21:58.947 --> 02:22:04.331]  Well, you look at Adam Lanza, you know, you just look at the pictures of... Oh, this Adam Lanza?
[02:22:04.331 --> 02:22:06.212]  The CIA recruited him?
[02:22:06.212 --> 02:22:08.133]  That's in the new FBI files?
[02:22:08.133 --> 02:22:09.294]  Who could make that up?
[02:22:09.614 --> 02:22:17.938]  Yeah, uh, he was so smart at hacking, apparently, uh, he had made it through the third level of their, uh, firewall.
[02:22:17.938 --> 02:22:23.480]  Theodore Kaczynski, declassified, LA Times, was C-I-A-M-K-Ultra.
[02:22:25.163 --> 02:22:26.465]  Same fingerprint every time.
[02:22:26.465 --> 02:22:31.892]  You just look at the police profile pictures of these individuals, you can see it in their eyes.
[02:22:31.892 --> 02:22:36.037]  It's almost like they're just dialed up or something.
[02:22:36.037 --> 02:22:42.645]  And you know, there's actually, if people think that's a conspiracy, there's a guy, Robert G. Malik.
[02:22:43.386 --> 02:22:51.709]  Uh, he has tech, he has patents and he's invented technology, you know, brainwave reading and altering technology.
[02:22:51.709 --> 02:22:53.309]  That's mainstream news now.
[02:22:53.309 --> 02:22:56.410]  They don't even need, you know, people think they need to implant chips.
[02:22:56.410 --> 02:22:57.511]  Look at these guys!
[02:22:57.511 --> 02:22:58.811]  They need to waterboard you.
[02:22:58.931 --> 02:23:01.695]  They ain't home folks, they are in a subconscious mode.
[02:23:01.695 --> 02:23:13.013]  You know the old super soldier thing they used to do, split your personalities, they don't need to do this anymore because they can simply use brainwave altering and reading technology.
[02:23:13.013 --> 02:23:14.075]  You could just be sitting there
[02:23:14.949 --> 02:23:16.150]  They click it on.
[02:23:16.150 --> 02:23:16.610]  That's that.
[02:23:16.610 --> 02:23:18.112]  They can activate you.
[02:23:18.112 --> 02:23:23.076]  It used to be where they would have to dial up these MKUltra dial-ups and whatnot, you know.
[02:23:23.076 --> 02:23:26.038]  They'd have to give them the code words, go through the litany.
[02:23:26.038 --> 02:23:27.719]  I usually catch her in the rye.
[02:23:27.719 --> 02:23:29.220]  This is all declassified.
[02:23:29.220 --> 02:23:29.721]  Right.
[02:23:29.721 --> 02:23:31.042]  This is not our opinion.
[02:23:31.042 --> 02:23:34.124]  I mean, look at these guys!
[02:23:34.124 --> 02:23:35.205]  You can just... I mean, bye-bye!
[02:23:36.678 --> 02:23:45.104]  And again, he was getting $100,000 a year or more in a secret DARPA program, the Batman shooter, the Aurora shooter.
[02:23:46.980 --> 02:23:51.742]  And his dad was a top interface with NASA, so was he!
[02:23:51.742 --> 02:23:55.443]  And again, they get you in a program, here, son, put this interface on.
[02:23:55.443 --> 02:23:56.204]  You're gone.
[02:23:56.204 --> 02:23:56.664]  Six months.
[02:23:56.664 --> 02:23:57.924]  They say he was gone for like a year.
[02:23:57.924 --> 02:24:00.526]  Come back, baby, you are crazier than a, you know what.
[02:24:00.526 --> 02:24:03.427]  Well, and you look at their pictures, their eyes are all bugged out.
[02:24:03.427 --> 02:24:04.747]  I mean, they have all these faces.
[02:24:04.747 --> 02:24:07.448]  By the way, he said he was mind-controlled, remember?
[02:24:07.448 --> 02:24:11.310]  He kind of broke the conditioning in the jail, and then the Fed showed up and said, everybody, you didn't hear that?
[02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:27.356]  Well, they have the algorithms now, Facebook algorithms, gate recognition, all this stuff that they can identify supposedly everyone, but they can't go through yearbook pictures and police profile pictures and see people's eyes bugging out this big and kind of, doesn't that raise a red flag?
[02:24:27.356 --> 02:24:30.157]  I mean, when you see all these people, there's real similarities.
[02:24:30.157 --> 02:24:34.879]  It's just, it's an, you know, it's the lights are on, but nobody's home.
[02:24:35.842 --> 02:24:41.004]  They're profiling people and they're going for this technology but they're doing it to all the wrong people.
[02:24:41.004 --> 02:24:44.806]  They're profiling the American citizen.
[02:24:44.806 --> 02:24:49.828]  You have to get weaker minded people for most of the programming to take hold.
[02:24:49.828 --> 02:24:51.769]  So it's already very suggestible people.
[02:24:52.557 --> 02:24:52.697]  That's
[02:25:12.275 --> 02:25:12.495]  Yeah.
[02:25:31.798 --> 02:25:48.378]  The pre-programmed entertainment and it just goes on and on and on and that's how... And let's be clear, even if he was in an MKUltra program, they did release him, they did let him go, they did cover up his dishonorable discharge, his conviction by that court, by that court-martial.
[02:25:49.841 --> 02:25:51.944]  Look, it's cultural, the shoot-em-up games.
[02:25:51.944 --> 02:25:53.405]  People go, no, take my shoot-em-up games away!
[02:25:53.405 --> 02:25:54.546]  They're like, real defensive.
[02:25:54.546 --> 02:25:56.168]  We know you're not a killer, but they were.
[02:25:56.168 --> 02:26:02.676]  Doom and all of it was former military training, instinctive shooting, so that you'd pull the trigger up close and kill the enemy.
[02:26:02.676 --> 02:26:07.821]  And this is all admitted, and you add the Hollywood and the culture, and then these arrested development males.
[02:26:08.971 --> 02:26:27.505]  Who never developed coping skills or interpersonal skills, they're freaked out by women, they feel like they're shut-ins, and then they just get into this psychopathic thing that is a major program, where if they hit enough people with this program, they know they're gonna go out and do it, because their life is going out and shooting people up.
[02:26:27.505 --> 02:26:31.327]  And that's their final real thing, to have power to be real.
[02:26:31.327 --> 02:26:36.091]  And then they hype it in the media, hoping it cascades with more mass shooting events.
[02:26:36.471 --> 02:26:45.153]  Yeah, notice, you know, they're coming out and they're saying like, you know, this is a lone wolf thing, this is a copycat thing, they're trying to get this out there.
[02:26:45.153 --> 02:26:51.534]  And it goes along with their whole agenda because then they can go around and they can say, look, we need to collect guns.
[02:26:51.534 --> 02:26:54.555]  But this thing backfired, just like you said, Alex, it backfired.
[02:26:54.555 --> 02:26:58.656]  The guy came out, one of the neighbors came out with his AR-15.
[02:26:58.656 --> 02:26:59.456]  NRA instructor.
[02:26:59.456 --> 02:27:01.076]  Took the bull by the horns.
[02:27:01.076 --> 02:27:02.497]  The shooter came around the front.
[02:27:02.497 --> 02:27:03.537]  He was going to go to a bigger church.
[02:27:03.837 --> 02:27:10.443]  Yeah, they said he was well-armed, he had plenty more ammunition, he might have went down the road.
[02:27:10.443 --> 02:27:11.944]  Notice Trump's getting good intel briefings.
[02:27:11.944 --> 02:27:19.571]  He said day one, mentally ill, and it could have been a lot worse, hundreds more, because they already had the data that he was going to go to a bunch of other churches.
[02:27:19.571 --> 02:27:21.873]  And so there's a civil war going on to embarrass Trump.
[02:27:21.873 --> 02:27:24.455]  I mean, no doubt this is staged.
[02:27:24.455 --> 02:27:26.697]  And the media is going to spin it and say that I said it didn't happen.
[02:27:26.697 --> 02:27:27.818]  That's not what I said.
[02:27:27.818 --> 02:27:28.559]  They let him out.
[02:27:28.939 --> 02:27:30.140]  Well, they let the stuff fall through.
[02:27:47.327 --> 02:27:47.928]  Go ahead.
[02:27:47.928 --> 02:27:51.451]  Well, they let it all fall through the cracks and then they use it to their advantage.
[02:27:51.451 --> 02:27:56.995]  It's almost like, don't let the crisis go to waste type scenario.
[02:27:56.995 --> 02:28:06.643]  And why would they not put out when he escaped from a mental institution, a homicidal maniac, an APB or even file that he had a dishonorable discharge, which they do automatically.
[02:28:06.643 --> 02:28:08.265]  Why did they protect him?
[02:28:08.265 --> 02:28:09.586]  Why was he protected?
[02:28:10.353 --> 02:28:16.797]  They probably already saw his whole algorithm, his whole profile on Facebook, everything, and saw where it was headed.
[02:28:16.797 --> 02:28:21.160]  You know, and essentially they can recruit people now.
[02:28:21.160 --> 02:28:22.921]  Look at it now, it's all a little power trip.
[02:28:22.921 --> 02:28:37.291]  It's that same program where you're a god, and they put them on the drug, and now they've got all these gyms and clubs and stuff that are really sex cults, where they initiate people as shamans and get them on the ayahuasca and the DMT and everything, and people think they're getting inducted into a cool deal.
[02:28:37.291 --> 02:28:40.033]  Those are feeder arms for MKUltra.
[02:28:40.913 --> 02:28:41.734]  It's getting them in.
[02:28:41.734 --> 02:28:42.334]  Gets them in.
[02:28:42.334 --> 02:28:44.095]  They're setting them up everywhere, man.
[02:28:44.095 --> 02:28:46.076]  And people tell you, I'm a god now.
[02:28:46.076 --> 02:28:46.716]  I'm a god.
[02:28:46.716 --> 02:28:47.137]  I'm a god.
[02:28:47.137 --> 02:28:48.457]  They're like, yes, you're a god now.
[02:28:48.457 --> 02:28:50.959]  Now you're under our control.

[02:33:15.822 --> 02:33:31.531]  They admit that they've dumbed the cartoons down to be just incoherent gibberish to screw your kids up.

[02:33:34.350 --> 02:33:35.331]  Everything's conditioning.
[02:33:35.331 --> 02:33:37.273]  The flicker rate of the televisions.
[02:33:37.273 --> 02:33:37.613]  All of it.
[02:33:37.613 --> 02:33:40.816]  Shepard Ambaless is my guest here in studio.
[02:33:40.816 --> 02:33:45.561]  I'm going to go ahead and post the fourth hour today, and I'm going to open the phones up exclusively for all of you.
[02:33:45.561 --> 02:33:48.884]  Kind of like we did on Reddit with an Ask Me Anything last night.
[02:33:48.884 --> 02:33:50.105]  I thought it went really well.
[02:33:50.105 --> 02:33:53.849]  I'm going to open the phones up specifically for your question.
[02:33:54.790 --> 02:33:57.731]  And then I'll give a one-minute answer and come back for a quick response.
[02:33:57.731 --> 02:34:00.112]  And that said, I'll take a lot of calls next hour.
[02:34:00.112 --> 02:34:05.114]  The toll-free number to join us if you want to get lined up, 877-789-ALEX.
[02:34:05.114 --> 02:34:06.274]  I'm taking questions.
[02:34:06.274 --> 02:34:07.715]  Any questions, ask me anything.
[02:34:07.715 --> 02:34:10.256]  877-789-ALEX, 877-789-ALEX.
[02:34:10.256 --> 02:34:15.978]  Now I'm going to stop right there and let Shepard get more into Vegas and more into the shooting and some of his research.
[02:34:15.978 --> 02:34:16.438]  But first,
[02:34:20.322 --> 02:34:25.605]  What I said here, and I tell you, that the globalists are after us.
[02:34:25.605 --> 02:34:33.229]  It's not just House Intelligence Committee hearings where they say we want Jones shut down and the head of Twitter goes, Sir, at lunch, I personally did it.
[02:34:33.229 --> 02:34:36.711]  I mean, this is real, okay?
[02:34:36.711 --> 02:34:43.814]  Now, obviously, there's good people in the government and good people in companies and corporations and daily life is the reason we're still here.
[02:34:43.814 --> 02:34:45.895]  And there's a God that's in charge.
[02:34:45.895 --> 02:34:48.297]  But, listeners need to understand,
[02:34:49.215 --> 02:34:55.917]  When I tell you that we're the tip of the spear, it's not like, oh, look, we're the tip of the spear.
[02:34:55.917 --> 02:34:56.837]  Boy, we're really somebody.
[02:34:56.837 --> 02:34:57.898]  Let's put a top hat on.
[02:34:57.898 --> 02:35:04.300]  It's like we're barreling in like galleons in a war, broadsiding each other, like we're hacking each other up.
[02:35:04.300 --> 02:35:06.600]  And I'm like, we're in the war, we need help.
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:07.781]  I mean, that's what this is.
[02:35:08.681 --> 02:35:12.042]  And there's really no fear in it, because it's exciting, it's real.
[02:35:12.042 --> 02:35:13.002]  We're up against evil.
[02:35:13.002 --> 02:35:14.523]  We know we're really fighting bad guys.
[02:35:14.523 --> 02:35:18.744]  You know, a lot of wars, one side's got a beef, the other side's got a beef.
[02:35:18.744 --> 02:35:20.325]  Both sides are pissed off at each other.
[02:35:20.325 --> 02:35:23.326]  Those are usually the worst wars, where both sides actually have a real reason.
[02:35:23.326 --> 02:35:30.628]  Imperial War's a little different, because, you know, usually the military isn't too behind it, because they know they're being the bad guys.
[02:35:30.628 --> 02:35:32.289]  We really are fighting the bad guys here.
[02:35:32.289 --> 02:35:36.330]  I mean, not that we're perfect, but the globalists are really nasty folks, and
[02:35:37.938 --> 02:35:44.441]  If you spread the articles and spread the videos and exercise your free speech and buy our products and pray for us.
[02:35:44.441 --> 02:35:45.501]  And I don't just throw that in.
[02:35:45.501 --> 02:35:49.923]  I mean, pray for us, spread the articles, the videos, but we don't really even have advertising.
[02:35:49.923 --> 02:35:55.765]  The radio networks do, and some of that, I mean, like 15% of what we do is advertising here.
[02:35:55.765 --> 02:35:58.746]  We need your financial support.
[02:35:58.746 --> 02:36:05.049]  I made the decision when Trump won to get even more hardcore and to expend everything.
[02:36:05.049 --> 02:36:05.909]  Just all in.
[02:36:07.179 --> 02:36:09.341]  We've got a big giant new studio we're building.
[02:36:09.341 --> 02:36:12.884]  It's TV satellites, TV stations are picking us up all over the place.
[02:36:12.884 --> 02:36:21.071]  I almost hate to really stick my head in a lion's mouth because I'm not doing stunts here, but Globeless figured out we played
[02:36:22.176 --> 02:36:22.957]  Possum for a while.
[02:36:22.957 --> 02:36:25.578]  We kind of flew under the radar.
[02:36:25.578 --> 02:36:27.059]  Oh, the hokey guy on the internet.
[02:36:27.059 --> 02:36:28.500]  I already knew our numbers four or five years ago.
[02:36:28.500 --> 02:36:30.061]  We're just astronomical.
[02:36:30.061 --> 02:36:33.403]  They knew too, but they just kind of hoped you didn't figure it out.
[02:36:33.403 --> 02:36:34.364]  Nobody figured it out.
[02:36:34.364 --> 02:36:39.247]  I mean, I knew the whole time my gut level was don't tell people how big we are.
[02:36:39.247 --> 02:36:44.391]  We've got to do it now because I mean, we're going in against the Death Star folks and
[02:36:45.638 --> 02:36:47.920]  All I care about is the end of the day that thing blows up.
[02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:49.842]  I don't care if I'm splattered around with it.
[02:36:49.842 --> 02:36:50.943]  And it's not that I want to die.
[02:36:50.943 --> 02:36:51.484]  It's the opposite.
[02:36:51.484 --> 02:36:52.545]  I never commit suicide.
[02:36:52.545 --> 02:36:58.710]  I'm just so committed to this that it's really liberating.
[02:36:58.710 --> 02:37:00.212]  It's not thrill-seeking either.
[02:37:00.212 --> 02:37:06.418]  The worse it gets, the worse the persecution, the nastier it gets, the more I know I'm right and it actually gives me energy.
[02:37:07.898 --> 02:37:10.080]  But the energy's not coming from the evil people coming after me.
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:17.465]  It's like, every time I metaphysically cross that line, when they double down and it doesn't intimidate me, I just get stronger.
[02:37:17.465 --> 02:37:19.567]  And the discernment gets better.
[02:37:19.567 --> 02:37:32.096]  The point of like, it's a shame what I do on air, I'll just tell you that, because the knowledge and the understanding and the research of being so focused on this is so far beyond even what I know how to describe.
[02:37:32.096 --> 02:37:35.479]  All I'm telling you is, this human awakening is real,
[02:37:36.869 --> 02:37:40.472]  It's fundamental, and it's our only hope.
[02:37:40.472 --> 02:37:44.356]  And so, if you're not taking advantage of the, I mean, why am I even discounting?
[02:37:44.356 --> 02:37:53.023]  Because these are great products you need, but I need to fund the operation, but then I lower the price down so much, we barely even make any money, even though we've sold a ton of products the last 24 hours.
[02:37:53.023 --> 02:37:59.529]  The supplements, the t-shirts, the books, the videos, it's all about getting the word out, it's all about making yourself healthier and better while funding us.
[02:37:59.529 --> 02:38:03.092]  Everything I do is neurotically symbiotic.
[02:38:03.092 --> 02:38:03.432]  And again,
[02:38:04.540 --> 02:38:10.985]  It's not like some philosophy I have, it's who I am.
[02:38:10.985 --> 02:38:22.835]  Call it God-fear, and if I even think about wargaming, something the enemy's doing, and I'm not even intending to be evil, I'm looking at how evil operates, I feel God's presence, and it's the only fear I have.
[02:38:22.835 --> 02:38:26.879]  Because when I start looking at how the enemy operates, I go, man, this feels really scary.
[02:38:26.879 --> 02:38:27.780]  And I'm not scared of them.
[02:38:28.868 --> 02:38:33.355]  When I watch these little demons flopping around trying to get us, they're sick.
[02:38:33.355 --> 02:38:40.888]  But I get scared because I can feel God wanting to just totally smash the whole planet to get rid of these people.
[02:38:40.888 --> 02:38:42.911]  So, I'm telling you folks, this is it.
[02:38:43.993 --> 02:38:47.135]  And I told you they got devil cults, that's all coming out in the news.
[02:38:47.135 --> 02:38:53.280]  I told you the next thing would be lesbian cults collecting women for cult leader men.
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:54.040]  That's in the news.
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:39:03.547]  I mean, I love how I got memorialized a month ago by the Huffington Post saying I'm insane, there aren't lesbian cults recruiting women into sex dungeons for men.
[02:39:03.547 --> 02:39:05.608]  Hey baby, it's all over the news today.
[02:39:05.608 --> 02:39:07.509]  I mean, you think I just pulled that out of a hat here?
[02:39:07.509 --> 02:39:09.231]  They hate me for a reason.
[02:39:09.231 --> 02:39:10.712]  I know what they're doing!
[02:39:11.809 --> 02:39:13.915]  And that's not like I'm on some power trip!
[02:39:13.915 --> 02:39:15.119]  I'm like, we told you, here they are!
[02:39:16.459 --> 02:39:18.260]  You go through that door, there's a nest of vampires.
[02:39:18.260 --> 02:39:19.541]  You go in there, they're in there, folks.
[02:39:19.541 --> 02:39:21.122]  I mean, what are we supposed to do about it?
[02:39:21.122 --> 02:39:23.383]  Let them creep around and keep having their way with us?
[02:39:23.383 --> 02:39:25.924]  I want to get torches and I want to destroy them!
[02:39:25.924 --> 02:39:27.405]  I want to drive stakes through their hearts!
[02:39:27.405 --> 02:39:32.048]  I want to drag them out in the middle of the field at high noon and tear open their caskets and watch them burn up!
[02:39:32.048 --> 02:39:34.369]  And I know, I don't mean literally, metaphysically.
[02:39:34.369 --> 02:39:36.230]  I want to attack them!
[02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:37.331]  I want to get them!
[02:39:37.331 --> 02:39:38.451]  I want to face them!
[02:39:38.451 --> 02:39:40.352]  I want to go into the room with them!
[02:39:40.352 --> 02:39:42.353]  I want to get my hands around their neck!
[02:39:42.353 --> 02:39:43.194]  You understand that?
[02:39:43.194 --> 02:39:44.875]  Because I want to get them off of me!
[02:39:45.535 --> 02:39:46.896]  There's fight and flight, folks.
[02:39:46.896 --> 02:39:48.237]  I'm running.
[02:39:48.237 --> 02:39:49.138]  I am running.
[02:39:49.138 --> 02:39:51.199]  I am frothing through the woods at them.
[02:39:51.199 --> 02:39:55.222]  Because I know I'm not going to run away and break my ankle.
[02:39:55.222 --> 02:39:56.783]  You don't break your ankle running at them.
[02:39:56.783 --> 02:39:58.584]  You break your ankle running away.
[02:39:58.584 --> 02:40:01.286]  I'm going 110% up against these people.
[02:40:01.286 --> 02:40:02.587]  I know metaphysically who they are.
[02:40:02.587 --> 02:40:03.768]  They are Satanists.
[02:40:03.768 --> 02:40:05.149]  They are devil worshippers.
[02:40:05.149 --> 02:40:06.270]  They hate God.
[02:40:06.270 --> 02:40:07.531]  They hate your children.
[02:40:07.531 --> 02:40:08.531]  They hate you.
[02:40:08.531 --> 02:40:14.896]  And until you break with them, and until you realize that it is spiritual, they will have control!
[02:40:16.465 --> 02:40:20.987]  And they're about to destroy the planet with all the stuff they've been doing!
[02:40:20.987 --> 02:40:25.189]  So, that's all I'm saying is that we need your support and your prayers.
[02:40:25.189 --> 02:40:26.910]  You know, I bottled you in here and I'm ranting.
[02:40:26.910 --> 02:40:27.970]  You want to comment on Texas?
[02:40:27.970 --> 02:40:28.291]  Comment.
[02:40:28.291 --> 02:40:32.192]  I wanted you to come in with an update on your latest... I said, what's your latest find?
[02:40:32.192 --> 02:40:34.774]  You said, yeah, more and more Islamic Civil War stuff.
[02:40:34.774 --> 02:40:37.175]  Give me your take on Vegas.
[02:40:37.175 --> 02:40:42.977]  Well, the bottom line is they're covering a lot of what happened up.
[02:40:44.338 --> 02:40:53.143]  You know, we know from multiple witnesses that things were going on all night throughout the whole town that, you know... It's a total circus!
[02:40:53.143 --> 02:40:53.863]  Absolutely.
[02:40:53.863 --> 02:41:02.108]  People, you know, people are getting... Most recently, look, some of these, this is what really gets me, is you got these eyewitnesses
[02:41:02.768 --> 02:41:05.710]  They come out and they do early reports on the news now.
[02:41:05.710 --> 02:41:06.891]  And they died.
[02:41:06.891 --> 02:41:07.971]  Well, that too.
[02:41:07.971 --> 02:41:13.094]  But this guy, Jake, came out and he... What is it, like 24 people are dead since the thing?
[02:41:13.094 --> 02:41:15.036]  Um, I'm not sure.
[02:41:15.036 --> 02:41:17.157]  I know that... Like, young women and everything?
[02:41:17.157 --> 02:41:20.079]  There was a couple car accidents.
[02:41:20.079 --> 02:41:23.521]  You know, someone mysteriously died at home.
[02:41:23.521 --> 02:41:25.082]  You know, they said it was... There's a bunch of them, actually.
[02:41:25.222 --> 02:41:28.783]  But her grandma was kind of worried about it, from what I've heard.
[02:41:28.783 --> 02:41:33.164]  And, you know, strange events really surrounding this whole thing.
[02:41:33.164 --> 02:41:43.807]  And a guy by the name of Jake, early on that night, just an hour after the shooting, something like that, or a little more, did an interview.
[02:41:43.807 --> 02:41:48.208]  And he was staying in the Delano, which is adjoined to the Mandalay Bay.
[02:41:49.068 --> 02:41:49.188]  And
[02:42:08.283 --> 02:42:11.124]  And people all announced shooting and glass and casings.
[02:42:11.124 --> 02:42:11.724]  We have all that.
[02:42:11.724 --> 02:42:13.985]  Well, this guy goes up there.
[02:42:13.985 --> 02:42:16.366]  They watch the massacre happen because they heard shooting.
[02:42:16.366 --> 02:42:19.227]  But then they heard shooting in the lobby of the Delano.
[02:42:19.227 --> 02:42:23.508]  So they took the elevator down like a little bit later, like moments later, him and his friends.
[02:42:23.508 --> 02:42:26.769]  By the way, this is also on the police dispatch.
[02:42:26.769 --> 02:42:27.349]  Yeah.
[02:42:27.349 --> 02:42:28.810]  And well, the doors open up.
[02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:33.072]  In the lobby, and it just reeks of gunpowder, he says.
[02:42:33.072 --> 02:42:48.819]  It just comes in, the gunpowder comes in, so, you know, and then later on he heard shots just moments later right around the corner and the police were... Well, I mean, I've had all the ballistics experts that testify in federal court, Navy, SEALs, Delta Force, all of them, they go, there's just guns going off all over the place.
[02:42:48.819 --> 02:42:51.881]  And you got the light machine guns and regular type M4.
[02:42:54.025 --> 02:43:13.997]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.

[02:46:57.705 --> 02:47:00.346]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:18.544 --> 02:47:21.430]  You know, these globalists.
[02:47:21.430 --> 02:47:26.640]  They want to play God, and they create dumbed-down zombies they can rule over.
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:28.684]  But then they're not real kings, they're kings of slaves.
[02:47:30.430 --> 02:47:36.294]  It's just weird, though, how people get these weird mental power trips, and they think they're invincible.
[02:47:36.294 --> 02:47:48.223]  And more and more people, they admit mental illness is just skyrocketing with smartphones and the electromagnetic stuff, and animals are going crazy in cities, and just, this is like, who's running this?
[02:47:48.223 --> 02:47:57.430]  Or are we just crazy with all our technology, have no idea what we've done to ourselves, and then psychopaths just create some order to it all, and think, oh, we have a master plan to kill everybody with all this
[02:47:58.732 --> 02:47:59.833]  Well, DIRTY TECHNOLOGY!
[02:48:21.774 --> 02:48:23.174]  It's just like robotic.
[02:48:23.174 --> 02:48:25.655]  A virtual, perpetual motion machine.
[02:48:25.655 --> 02:48:28.736]  The technology is doing it itself now.
[02:48:28.736 --> 02:48:30.257]  We just keep progressing.
[02:48:30.257 --> 02:48:32.478]  We're 5G towers up now.
[02:48:32.478 --> 02:48:36.399]  And by the way, all the big billionaires go, yes, we're taking over and we're going to kill you.
[02:48:36.399 --> 02:48:37.199]  It's liberal.
[02:48:37.199 --> 02:48:38.540]  And they go, liberal, liberal, liberal.
[02:48:38.540 --> 02:48:39.920]  He goes, kill us, kill us.
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:41.761]  I mean, and then all these minions attack us.
[02:48:41.761 --> 02:48:44.082]  How dare you not want us all to die, Jones?
[02:48:44.082 --> 02:48:45.062]  F you!
[02:48:45.062 --> 02:48:46.383]  We'll cross humans with animals.
[02:48:46.383 --> 02:48:46.903]  Screw you!
[02:48:47.483 --> 02:48:54.286]  Yeah, and you're like, and you're like, okay, whoa, I mean, it's like, it's the delusion of the minions, like they're a part of it.
[02:48:54.286 --> 02:48:55.466]  They want it now.
[02:48:55.466 --> 02:48:57.607]  It's like they're begging for it.
[02:48:57.607 --> 02:48:59.248]  You know, you, you were walking through the screen.
[02:48:59.248 --> 02:49:01.068]  Well, it's because they, because we have free will.
[02:49:01.068 --> 02:49:08.732]  They program people artificially to turn off their free will and then go, kill me, kill me, but first kill the Christians and kill the babies.
[02:49:10.392 --> 02:49:13.255]  I mean, it's like the guy that threw coffee on you in Seattle.
[02:49:13.255 --> 02:49:14.356]  He's probably one of these kids.
[02:49:14.356 --> 02:49:16.217]  He was literally gibbering.
[02:49:16.217 --> 02:49:16.738]  Yeah.
[02:49:16.738 --> 02:49:19.400]  And he goes, I'm ugly.
[02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:20.100]  They always say that.
[02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:21.982]  They go, Satan kill you.
[02:49:21.982 --> 02:49:24.924]  Meanwhile, you're talking about real stuff that happened.
[02:49:24.924 --> 02:49:26.685]  But why do they chirp Satan and go...
[02:49:27.886 --> 02:49:30.788]  I mean, it's not like a joke, they do it.
[02:49:30.788 --> 02:49:33.970]  It goes back to, look at these designers in Hollywood.
[02:49:33.970 --> 02:49:40.034]  Look at all the satanic fashion designers, the whole nine yards.
[02:49:40.034 --> 02:49:46.858]  I mean, I was watching a fashion show the other day, Alex, and you wouldn't believe some of the get-ups these people were wearing.
[02:49:46.858 --> 02:49:50.220]  I mean, you could just basically pull things out of the garbage, put them on.
[02:49:50.220 --> 02:49:52.002]  And it's all to debase you.
[02:49:52.982 --> 02:49:59.969]  And by the way, that's declassified, that they have ugly art and ugly houses and small things to make you feel brokeback.
[02:49:59.969 --> 02:50:03.512]  Yeah, well they want to... This is so uncool, man!
[02:50:03.512 --> 02:50:04.834]  Like, what the hell?
[02:50:04.834 --> 02:50:11.060]  They keep us all in our cages, essentially, and that's what they've always... And then Trump doesn't want that.
[02:50:12.128 --> 02:50:18.453]  Well, you know, the true American spirit just... And it's not like he's even that nice of a guy.
[02:50:18.453 --> 02:50:23.498]  He just isn't out to like hurt random productive people.
[02:50:23.498 --> 02:50:25.279]  If you try to run over him, he'll run over you.
[02:50:25.279 --> 02:50:35.888]  But he's like, he sees all this degeneracy and all the throngs of like weak people that join with the psychopaths and want to pull down everything decent and just piss on everything.
[02:50:35.888 --> 02:50:36.549]  And he's like, no.
[02:50:36.829 --> 02:50:39.071]  Look at this garb they wear in a church.
[02:50:39.071 --> 02:50:40.753]  I mean, this is like a fashion show in a church.
[02:50:40.753 --> 02:50:42.816]  Yeah, they have satanic ceremonies in churches.
[02:50:42.816 --> 02:50:58.252]  They not only want to turn us into worker bees like we've talked about before, asexual race of worker bees, basically like a grey alien type robot, they also want to turn you into literally like satanic demons.
[02:50:59.293 --> 02:51:12.465]  Well, they teach you it's cute to be in a cult, you made the party, and now we're going to torture you and have you torture others, and then nobody's going to stand up for you and we kill you because we kill somebody every night.
[02:51:12.465 --> 02:51:14.246]  And you just hope it isn't you next.
[02:51:14.246 --> 02:51:23.314]  Also, some psychopath, weird pot-bellied dude can strangle you to death when he has sex with you because that makes him feel powerful.
[02:51:23.314 --> 02:51:23.715]  No!
[02:51:24.415 --> 02:51:26.116]  We're gonna get you!
[02:51:26.116 --> 02:51:26.796]  Understand?
[02:51:26.796 --> 02:51:27.616]  And they know it.
[02:51:27.616 --> 02:51:28.916]  They know I'm not afraid of them.
[02:51:28.916 --> 02:51:30.397]  And they know I want to rip their heads off.
[02:51:30.397 --> 02:51:30.797]  They know it.
[02:51:30.797 --> 02:51:32.217]  Look at this lady's got her pentagram on.
[02:51:32.217 --> 02:51:33.518]  They want to die so bad.
[02:51:33.518 --> 02:51:35.158]  Look at this guy.
[02:51:35.158 --> 02:51:36.619]  Look at this punk thinking he's tough.
[02:51:36.619 --> 02:51:39.360]  And that's the type of person that has that psyche like he's tough.
[02:51:39.360 --> 02:51:40.280]  He'll go in the church.
[02:51:40.280 --> 02:51:41.520]  He'll show you.
[02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:42.421]  He'll go in the church.
[02:51:42.421 --> 02:51:45.122]  We should stop letting people like that operate!
[02:51:45.122 --> 02:51:46.562]  It's our fault!
[02:51:46.562 --> 02:51:47.762]  It looks like the Aurora shooter.
[02:51:47.762 --> 02:51:48.743]  Look at that little twit.
[02:51:50.137 --> 02:51:50.778]  Yeah.
[02:51:50.778 --> 02:51:53.901]  Can you imagine me, one of these kidnapped kids, and the door opens?
[02:51:53.901 --> 02:51:56.404]  It's like a Satanic Lord of the Rings, uh, gimmick.
[02:51:56.404 --> 02:51:58.427]  And it's all about, there's a wimpiness to it.
[02:51:58.427 --> 02:51:59.788]  It's all about me.
[02:51:59.788 --> 02:52:01.070]  I have my fun now.
[02:52:01.070 --> 02:52:01.911]  Me.
[02:52:01.911 --> 02:52:04.934]  I'm gonna hurt the baby, cause it's all about me.
[02:52:04.934 --> 02:52:08.559]  I'm gonna desecrate innocence and all that's good, cause I'm a selfish worm.
[02:52:09.926 --> 02:52:12.827]  Yeah, and they hit us with this from day one.
[02:52:12.827 --> 02:52:16.428]  And I don't even want to kill them because they're not even, it's like, I don't want to touch them.
[02:52:16.428 --> 02:52:19.470]  I just want to go to their own phantom zone, which is hell.
[02:52:19.470 --> 02:52:24.111]  Like, oh, you go here forever with each other and just drool on each other.
[02:52:24.111 --> 02:52:29.433]  Well, like, you know, all the liberals want to basically make California a safe haven.
[02:52:29.433 --> 02:52:32.114]  They want to break away from the union and everything.
[02:52:32.114 --> 02:52:33.655]  You know, this is, this is,
[02:52:34.631 --> 02:52:36.012]  What they've done to people.
[02:52:36.012 --> 02:52:43.198]  They've now got people believing that, you know, if you attack this, like you and me are sitting here talking about this.
[02:52:43.198 --> 02:52:46.601]  If you don't want the pedophilia and the sickness and the devil worship.
[02:52:46.601 --> 02:52:47.462]  If you don't want it.
[02:52:47.462 --> 02:52:47.662]  Yeah.
[02:52:47.662 --> 02:52:51.846]  If you don't want to wear a satanic garb or, you know, then you're not the norm.
[02:52:51.846 --> 02:52:55.509]  You know, you can't, we can't talk about this because right now.
[02:52:55.509 --> 02:52:56.650]  They want you in their temple.
[02:52:57.370 --> 02:53:03.833]  They don't want you to walk out and look at the stars and the sun and your wife or your husband or your children and just the fulfillment of life and the goodness of God.
[02:53:03.833 --> 02:53:06.294]  They want you to be in the muck with them.
[02:53:06.294 --> 02:53:08.775]  The transgender bathrooms, you know.
[02:53:08.775 --> 02:53:12.216]  And he wants you disarmed so he can take his time with you.
[02:53:12.216 --> 02:53:15.498]  They want to break everything down into a minutia to where...
[02:53:16.238 --> 02:53:25.645]  Literally everything that you do during the day is perceived a certain way so that you can't step out of line.
[02:53:25.645 --> 02:53:30.969]  This is a very interesting way of controlling the whole population and how they have minds.
[02:53:30.969 --> 02:53:32.571]  It's a giant re-education camp.
[02:53:32.571 --> 02:53:33.752]  Political correctness.
[02:53:33.752 --> 02:53:36.033]  We're people in demon clown outfits.
[02:53:36.033 --> 02:53:36.314]  Men.
[02:53:37.441 --> 02:53:39.122]  Come and teach your children about sex.
[02:54:07.901 --> 02:54:09.442]  Apple factory!
[02:54:09.442 --> 02:54:10.403]  Again, it's the norm.
[02:54:10.403 --> 02:54:12.204]  They want to normalize everything.
[02:54:12.204 --> 02:54:19.889]  They think that transvestite unicorns going around, you know... Well, the media spun it and said Jones hates crossdressers reading to kids.
[02:54:19.889 --> 02:54:22.591]  We have the video where they're sexualizing.
[02:54:22.591 --> 02:54:31.036]  I don't want a heterosexual, a homosexual, anybody with my four-year-old telling him, you may have a weenie, but you're really gonna be a girl.
[02:54:31.036 --> 02:54:32.257]  I mean, what the hell?
[02:54:32.577 --> 02:54:39.380]  Yep, and it's how everything's geared with all these... By the way, you can play it, like, how many are gonna be a drag queen?
[02:54:39.380 --> 02:54:41.141]  And he's like, I'm gonna be one!
[02:54:41.141 --> 02:54:49.905]  This is allowing the sexualization of children by some weirdo with tattoos all over them with a demon mask on!
[02:54:49.905 --> 02:54:53.106]  I mean, if you saw a guy in a park like that, you'd start running from him!
[02:54:53.106 --> 02:54:56.568]  It was never normal, you know... If that was in a sewage pipe, you'd have a heart attack!
[02:54:57.136 --> 02:55:03.699]  It was never normal, but now it's the new norm, and if you say something about it, you know, God forbid.
[02:55:03.699 --> 02:55:08.120]  Israel had teenagers scaring people, running around in demon clown masks, and one guy got shot.
[02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:09.441]  They banned it.
[02:55:09.441 --> 02:55:13.382]  And it's not even because you're wearing a demon mask, jumping out on someone, you're going to get killed.
[02:55:13.382 --> 02:55:18.084]  But see, oh, our kids, though, and the demons here, ah, hello, children.
[02:55:18.084 --> 02:55:19.425]  Well, it's a test.
[02:55:19.425 --> 02:55:20.245]  It's getting you ready.
[02:55:21.578 --> 02:55:23.520]  Well, it's like the TSA pat-downs.
[02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:26.263]  Top psychologists have said it trains them to be pedophiles.
[02:55:26.263 --> 02:55:26.523]  It does.
[02:55:26.523 --> 02:55:31.408]  Well, you look at the progression from cartoons to, say, rap music.
[02:55:31.408 --> 02:55:34.592]  A lot of these, um... But see, in Israel, it caused panic.
[02:55:34.592 --> 02:55:40.638]  But with your children, hey, you know, the guy dressed like a woman with a demon mask on wants to come tell your kids about sex.
[02:55:40.638 --> 02:55:40.999]  It's alright.
[02:55:40.999 --> 02:55:41.459]  It's only normal.
[02:55:41.579 --> 02:55:48.026]  Everything's a slight progression until basically they get you out into society now.
[02:55:48.026 --> 02:55:57.095]  You know, you become of age, you're 18, you're supposed to take on a job, but no, now you're still living in your mother's basement, you know, until you're 30.
[02:55:57.095 --> 02:55:58.977]  They've extended all this.
[02:55:58.977 --> 02:56:03.562]  And again, oh, you want to be somebody, run around at 10 o'clock at night, a demon clown, make people have heart attacks.
[02:56:05.051 --> 02:56:06.512]  And next, I'll go shoot up a church!
[02:56:06.512 --> 02:56:12.215]  Well, and they got guys going around in clown outfits, you know, doing all sorts of funny stuff.
[02:56:12.215 --> 02:56:14.697]  I mean, it's just... And you know where clowns came from.
[02:56:16.072 --> 02:56:16.713]  No.
[02:56:16.713 --> 02:56:34.831]  And the ancient suicide, and because people wanted to be killed, and human sacrifice cults in Babylon and Egypt, because they had white magic as well as black magic, you would wear fake red hair, this is in anthropology, this is real history books, and white mask and a red nose, and then you have fake teeth drawn, and then...
[02:56:36.244 --> 02:56:38.465]  Uh, he would be part of the human sacrifice of the children.
[02:56:38.465 --> 02:56:46.669]  They'd either have big furnaces in front of the idol, or they would lance the babies and drink their blood, and then they would take goblets of the blood and deliver it around.
[02:56:46.669 --> 02:56:47.150]  Wow.
[02:56:47.150 --> 02:56:48.150]  So that's where this all comes from.
[02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.690]  Wow.
[02:56:48.690 --> 02:56:51.392]  And this is what you're seeing now, and you... Well, they tell you with it!
[02:56:51.392 --> 02:57:03.298]  He's gonna... gonna terrorize your child and suck their soul during the long, uh, black mass that takes sometimes three days to torture your two-year-old or three-year-old, begging for mommy to death, and it's very liberal, so why don't you just get used to it?
[02:57:04.807 --> 02:57:07.289]  Yeah, it's, well, and they- Why don't you just be liberal?
[02:57:07.289 --> 02:57:10.011]  It's so trendy, why don't you just be liberal?
[02:57:10.011 --> 02:57:11.733]  Liberal, liberal, liberal.
[02:57:11.733 --> 02:57:17.137]  Not to mention, you know, they talk about mass shootings and all this, but look at how violent Hollywood is.
[02:57:17.137 --> 02:57:24.404]  Look at how, everything's a cop and- But it's okay as long as it's a feminist group that kidnaps the women and then tortures them and delivers them to a man in a castle.
[02:57:24.404 --> 02:57:24.884]  Yeah.
[02:57:24.884 --> 02:57:28.927]  As long as it's women delivering you to the castle, it's liberal.
[02:57:28.927 --> 02:57:30.729]  What, are you against feminism?
[02:57:30.729 --> 02:57:32.751]  What's wrong with women in cages starving to death?
[02:57:33.766 --> 02:57:44.908]  We'll be right back with hour number four, your calls and more, in five more minutes with Shepard Ambulance.

[02:58:45.709 --> 02:58:48.851]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:58:48.851 --> 02:58:56.277]  That's why now more than ever we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[02:58:56.277 --> 02:59:01.881]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:59:02.641 --> 02:59:10.309]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[02:59:10.309 --> 02:59:18.178]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[02:59:18.898 --> 02:59:23.982]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[02:59:23.982 --> 02:59:26.104]  They are the anti-liberals.
[02:59:26.104 --> 02:59:39.494]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:59:47.173 --> 02:59:49.758]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:03.698 --> 03:00:08.582]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:00:08.582 --> 03:00:10.984]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.984 --> 03:00:18.351]  The story's up on Infowars.com, Newswars.com, and it's covered widely at DrudgeReport.com.
[03:00:18.351 --> 03:00:19.452]  Alabama rock.
[03:00:19.452 --> 03:00:22.534]  Judge Moore hit with sex accusations.
[03:00:22.534 --> 03:00:23.655]  Republican panic.
[03:00:23.655 --> 03:00:26.297]  McConnell, step aside if true.
[03:00:26.297 --> 03:00:29.100]  Now let me show you the rest of the story here.
[03:00:29.100 --> 03:00:29.961]  Notice right below,
[03:00:31.531 --> 03:00:33.132]  Winner of discontent.
[03:00:33.132 --> 03:00:34.732]  Senate tax plan delays.
[03:00:34.732 --> 03:00:36.033]  Cuts.
[03:00:36.033 --> 03:00:36.893]  Seven brackets.
[03:00:36.893 --> 03:00:38.674]  Eliminate state and local deductions.
[03:00:38.674 --> 03:00:40.955]  Another top House Republican retires.
[03:00:40.955 --> 03:00:42.096]  Fourteen departures.
[03:00:42.096 --> 03:00:43.396]  Majority at risk.
[03:00:43.396 --> 03:00:52.100]  The Republican elite that know they're going to lose elections are all quitting to take the House control away from Trump so he can't get the tax cuts.
[03:00:52.100 --> 03:00:58.643]  Then they're saying, 35, 40 years ago, Judge Moore talked to teenage women
[03:00:59.819 --> 03:01:02.942]  Never made sexual comments or advances.
[03:01:02.942 --> 03:01:06.565]  They even admit this, even if it's true.
[03:01:06.565 --> 03:01:09.707]  He did not try to initiate sexual contact with them.
[03:01:09.707 --> 03:01:16.813]  But, I guess at the soda fountain or something, women that were like 18 years old or whatever, he said, they look good, honey.
[03:01:16.813 --> 03:01:18.674]  Now, let's just say that's true.
[03:01:18.674 --> 03:01:20.456]  Notice they take contact with women.
[03:01:22.176 --> 03:01:25.439]  As criminal or pedophilia, 17, 18 year old women.
[03:01:25.439 --> 03:01:29.282]  Then they just cover up all the rape and all the rest of it, and then it just gets worse from there.
[03:01:29.282 --> 03:01:30.944]  See, so that's what they're doing.
[03:01:30.944 --> 03:01:32.705]  They're detonating all of this now.
[03:01:32.705 --> 03:01:40.312]  And they've got, oh, three women that said Roy Moore 30 plus years ago told young women they were purdy.
[03:01:41.934 --> 03:01:43.555]  Oh my gosh!
[03:01:43.555 --> 03:01:48.336]  And, oh, McConnell is so upset now he can't get enough people.
[03:01:48.336 --> 03:01:53.638]  See, at first I saw these Republicans resigning because they were way behind the polls for re-election, but now I get it.
[03:01:53.638 --> 03:01:54.118]  No, no.
[03:01:54.118 --> 03:01:59.759]  They're leaving now so that they can scuttle Trump and literally stop everything.
[03:01:59.759 --> 03:02:01.460]  This is, I mean, it's like...
[03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:05.742]  The Trump stuff, it is incredible.
[03:02:05.742 --> 03:02:09.684]  Harvey Weinstein raping all these women, all this other stuff.
[03:02:09.684 --> 03:02:11.686]  Kevin Spacey, that's all okay.
[03:02:11.686 --> 03:02:17.810]  Roy Moore, 30 plus years ago, told women, some of them who might have been under 18, they were pretty.
[03:02:18.630 --> 03:02:21.392]  Well, you know, and I mean, I mean, all the time I'll sit there.
[03:02:21.392 --> 03:02:26.955]  I've got three daughters, but I'll sit there, you know, at a play or whatever, and tell girls, you sure look nice.
[03:02:26.955 --> 03:02:31.298]  Well, there'll be an article, Jones once told a 14-year-old girl she looked nice.
[03:02:31.298 --> 03:02:31.538]  Again?
[03:02:31.538 --> 03:02:32.458]  That's like a Texas thing.
[03:02:32.458 --> 03:02:33.159]  They say, don't even do that.
[03:02:33.159 --> 03:02:34.679]  Like, like, hey, sweetie, how you doing?
[03:02:34.679 --> 03:02:36.220]  I'll say to, you know, like, waitress, come over.
[03:02:36.220 --> 03:02:37.161]  How you doing, darling?
[03:02:37.321 --> 03:02:38.001]  Yeah, you can't.
[03:02:38.001 --> 03:02:40.642]  And like northerners go, what the hell, that woman just called you darling.
[03:02:40.642 --> 03:02:41.622]  Yeah, you can't say darling.
[03:02:41.622 --> 03:02:44.223]  That's what you do in the South.
[03:02:44.223 --> 03:02:46.304]  The PC culture has got everyone now.
[03:02:46.304 --> 03:02:48.625]  Roy Moore told girls they were pretty.
[03:02:48.625 --> 03:02:49.805]  Yeah, you can't.
[03:02:49.805 --> 03:02:51.126]  He didn't try to take them out.
[03:02:51.126 --> 03:02:52.726]  He didn't try to have sex with them.
[03:02:52.726 --> 03:02:53.306]  But you know what?
[03:02:53.306 --> 03:02:54.387]  He told them they were pretty.
[03:02:54.387 --> 03:02:58.148]  You have to now look at your neighbor or anyone you talk to or anyone you are
[03:02:58.228 --> 03:03:03.029]  But a tranny clown dressed as a demon can tell you three-year-old about sex.
[03:03:03.029 --> 03:03:17.853]  Yeah, but you got to treat everyone else like a robot and you just you can't have any feeling any emotion But yeah, you got to you got to just let unicorns in with demon horns and everything teacher kids anything in school And I mean, it's just absolutely insane.
[03:03:17.853 --> 03:03:19.053]  What do you make of this Roy Moore?
[03:03:19.053 --> 03:03:21.614]  I mean because you read it I've got the articles here.
[03:03:21.614 --> 03:03:21.954]  It's like
[03:03:22.799 --> 03:03:26.943]  He did not try to initiate sexual contact with them.
[03:03:26.943 --> 03:03:32.407]  Again, they're trying to break this down into minutia, Alex, is what they want to do.
[03:03:32.407 --> 03:03:37.251]  They want to get it to where, you know, you basically can't even come out of your little cubicle anymore.
[03:03:37.251 --> 03:03:40.013]  You can't even... And these are women on Facebook.
[03:03:40.013 --> 03:03:41.455]  We don't even know knew him.
[03:03:41.455 --> 03:03:44.777]  And then he's, of course, denying it all, I should add.
[03:03:44.777 --> 03:03:49.241]  Well, you know, no one's... You just know this is the next for everybody.
[03:03:49.241 --> 03:03:50.102]  This is it.
[03:03:51.603 --> 03:03:54.606]  It's Hollywood, they're the ones all doing it.
[03:03:54.606 --> 03:03:59.410]  Wiener, Epstein, flights with little kids on board, the Clintons, all confirmed.
[03:03:59.410 --> 03:04:00.871]  They don't get in trouble though.
[03:04:00.871 --> 03:04:01.492]  Oh no.
[03:04:01.492 --> 03:04:02.092]  Roy Moore!
[03:04:03.078 --> 03:04:06.541]  Thirty-five years ago, I might have told a teenage girl she was purdy.
[03:04:06.541 --> 03:04:07.201]  Could you imagine?
[03:04:07.201 --> 03:04:10.504]  So it's all this reverse psychology.
[03:04:10.504 --> 03:04:13.506]  They're trying to just flip anything they're doing.
[03:04:13.506 --> 03:04:17.469]  They're basically saying everyone else is doing it, you know?
[03:04:17.469 --> 03:04:24.475]  Oh, they make it so uncomfortable that if you're with your kids at the park, you're not supposed to talk to other people in their families if you're a male.
[03:04:24.475 --> 03:04:27.317]  But then meanwhile, they allow the sexualization of children.
[03:04:28.462 --> 03:04:34.726]  Yeah, it goes on and on and on, and that's what they want, and that's how the new world order is coming about.
[03:04:34.726 --> 03:04:36.147]  We'll come back and join us soon.
[03:04:36.147 --> 03:04:38.548]  Intelhub.com, Intelhub.com.
[03:04:38.548 --> 03:04:39.909]  Amazing research on all sides.
[03:04:39.909 --> 03:04:43.291]  We'll continue to collate all the info or information.
[03:04:43.291 --> 03:04:45.913]  We'll be back with your phone calls, your questions straight ahead.
[03:04:45.913 --> 03:04:46.373]  Thanks, Shepard.
[03:04:46.373 --> 03:04:46.774]  Anytime.
[03:04:53.345 --> 03:04:56.787]  My fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with a very important message.
[03:05:12.375 --> 03:05:23.421]  Really, really good news is that, yes, we're having to end the sale of 50% off on Anthroplex, but DNA Force, after almost four months, out of stock, is back in stock.
[03:05:23.421 --> 03:05:25.382]  25% off our flagship product.
[03:05:25.382 --> 03:05:30.225]  Also, Biome Defense, the great probiotic, that is 25% off as well.
[03:05:30.225 --> 03:05:31.586]  So a lot of things are selling out.
[03:05:31.906 --> 03:05:34.607]  A lot of things are still at record sales.
[03:05:34.607 --> 03:05:38.908]  Like Silver Bullet, super high quality colloidal silver is still 50% off.
[03:05:38.908 --> 03:05:43.010]  And there's other sales that are still going, but they're all about to end.
[03:05:43.010 --> 03:05:49.472]  Whether it's DNA Force, or whether it's Silver Bullet, it's all available right now at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:05:59.577 --> 03:06:01.919]  We've seen the end of the Clintons.
[03:06:01.919 --> 03:06:04.461]  We'll soon see the end of the globalists.
[03:06:04.461 --> 03:06:07.484]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[03:06:07.484 --> 03:06:10.366]  It's not true!
[03:06:10.366 --> 03:06:11.928]  That's impossible!
[03:06:11.928 --> 03:06:13.429]  Search your feelings.
[03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:15.851]  You know it to be true.
[03:06:39.148 --> 03:06:45.175]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[03:06:45.175 --> 03:06:46.217]  Move, bitch!
[03:06:46.217 --> 03:06:47.238]  Get out of the way!
[03:06:55.412 --> 03:06:59.514]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[03:06:59.514 --> 03:07:03.476]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[03:07:03.476 --> 03:07:05.397]  I will not let you down.
[03:07:05.397 --> 03:07:07.578]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:07:07.578 --> 03:07:10.780]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[03:07:10.780 --> 03:07:12.861]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[03:07:12.861 --> 03:07:18.303]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[03:07:18.303 --> 03:07:20.024]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:07:20.024 --> 03:07:21.105]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:07:23.493 --> 03:07:31.760]  Judge Roy Moore has put out a statement saying that this is complete lies, the very definition of fake news and is defamation.
[03:07:31.760 --> 03:07:45.190]  You'll remember they filed four fake lawsuits on President Trump after he got the nomination, trying to make him step down, claiming that he'd raped teenage girls with Jerry Epstein.
[03:07:45.190 --> 03:07:46.431]  Turned out all of it was fake.
[03:07:46.431 --> 03:07:48.353]  There weren't even real people filing it.
[03:07:48.353 --> 03:07:51.896]  It was Bill Clinton and Hillary and Kevin Spacey that had flown on the aircraft.
[03:07:53.507 --> 03:08:03.637]  Well, after endorsing Democrat in Alabama, Bezos, Washington Post plans to hit Roy Moore with allegations of inappropriate revelations with teenagers.
[03:08:03.637 --> 03:08:06.019]  Judge claims smear campaign.
[03:08:06.019 --> 03:08:17.491]  They claim 30 plus years ago, he told 14, 15, 16 year old girls, there's three of them, stuff like, you're purty, but never say anything about sex or anything else.
[03:08:20.245 --> 03:08:24.709]  Again, as many pedophiles as there are in government, they're in both parties.
[03:08:24.709 --> 03:08:30.375]  But again, you have the media, Twitter, Facebook, covering up when the Weinstein stuff came out.
[03:08:30.375 --> 03:08:34.419]  The Kevin Spacey stuff, all of it, covering it up, covering it up, covering it up.
[03:08:34.419 --> 03:08:43.267]  Now this guy, with no history of any problems, nothing, defeats the establishment Republican, embarrasses the establishment, and then suddenly
[03:08:43.988 --> 03:08:46.469]  A bunch of Republican Senators resigned.
[03:08:46.469 --> 03:08:48.730]  Fourteen House Republicans resigned.
[03:08:48.730 --> 03:08:50.751]  And I was thinking, oh, well, they're low in the polls.
[03:08:50.751 --> 03:08:53.652]  They're just... No.
[03:08:53.652 --> 03:08:59.994]  They're leaving to scuttle Congress so that Trump can't get the tax cuts and the rest of it.
[03:08:59.994 --> 03:09:02.875]  I mean, this is full-on war.
[03:09:02.875 --> 03:09:05.136]  He says this is garbage.
[03:09:05.136 --> 03:09:12.839]  This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation.
[03:09:12.839 --> 03:09:13.079]  Again.
[03:09:15.486 --> 03:09:19.248]  We're talking decades and decades and decades and decades old.
[03:09:19.248 --> 03:09:21.749]  I heard you guys opened a mic.
[03:09:21.749 --> 03:09:27.112]  You want to say something?
[03:09:27.112 --> 03:09:28.513]  There is a lot to go over here.
[03:09:28.513 --> 03:09:33.796]  This is a real fight and it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[03:09:33.796 --> 03:09:36.557]  See, look at these headlines.
[03:09:36.557 --> 03:09:39.059]  Five women say Louis C.K.
[03:09:39.059 --> 03:09:41.040]  crossed line into sexual harassment.
[03:09:43.450 --> 03:09:44.931]  Movie premiere cancelled.
[03:09:44.931 --> 03:09:48.875]  They're making it about guys hitting on women, the ultimate crime.
[03:09:48.875 --> 03:09:49.655]  Is it too pushy?
[03:09:49.655 --> 03:09:50.776]  Could it be creepy?
[03:09:50.776 --> 03:09:52.337]  Okay!
[03:09:52.337 --> 03:09:55.080]  If he's their boss, maybe it's sexual harassment.
[03:09:55.080 --> 03:09:58.643]  The point is, it's all about that.
[03:09:58.643 --> 03:10:04.748]  Not the rapes and the sex dungeons and all the stuff that comes out but gets no attention.
[03:10:04.748 --> 03:10:08.350]  And then it just turns into... And I've warned everybody.
[03:10:08.350 --> 03:10:09.652]  I said, watch.
[03:10:09.652 --> 03:10:12.354]  A lot of these leftists are getting taken down right now because of this.
[03:10:15.248 --> 03:10:20.232]  They are going to now start making stuff up about conservatives.
[03:10:20.232 --> 03:10:30.839]  I mean, I'm surprised they haven't done it about me yet, but I have led, since college, a pretty conservative life.
[03:10:30.839 --> 03:10:40.065]  And so, and I'm, everybody makes the comment that knows me, like, man, you go home at five, six o'clock and make dinner and hang out with your family, maybe go to a movie every two weeks.
[03:10:40.065 --> 03:10:43.488]  I mean, I've got Mr. Leave it to Beaver lifestyle.
[03:10:44.258 --> 03:10:53.240]  And it's not that I'm like Mr. Goody Two Shoes or something, I just, I work hard, I go home and eat, I read a book, play with the kids, go for a swim, I go to bed!
[03:10:53.240 --> 03:10:59.481]  Everybody that knows me starts getting texts from me at 4.30 in the morning.
[03:10:59.481 --> 03:11:09.563]  But, you know, they've told me, they said, listen Jones, you don't shut up about Islam, you don't shut up about Hollywood and the Democrats, and you don't shut up about the Podestas.
[03:11:11.089 --> 03:11:12.310]  Things are about to get real bad.
[03:11:12.310 --> 03:11:12.970]  Well, you know what?
[03:11:12.970 --> 03:11:14.951]  Just do whatever you're going to do.
[03:11:14.951 --> 03:11:17.793]  But I know this, whatever you make up is as phony as a $3 bill.
[03:11:17.793 --> 03:11:28.578]  Because my whole life has been, unless they get girlfriends from 25 years ago, and then it was all consensual, I mean, what are they going to say?
[03:11:28.578 --> 03:11:29.479]  I've already said it all.
[03:11:29.479 --> 03:11:34.522]  Because I can't help but run my mouth about what's going on.
[03:11:34.522 --> 03:11:36.203]  There's no scripting here.
[03:11:36.203 --> 03:11:40.405]  There's nobody telling me what to say because I can't help but just blurt out whatever's really going on.
[03:11:42.671 --> 03:11:46.854]  But I wonder what they're cooking up next because they're just constantly making stuff up.
[03:11:46.854 --> 03:11:51.037]  I mean, it just, it never ends.
[03:11:51.037 --> 03:11:54.820]  All right, enough about me and enough about Judge Roy Moore.
[03:11:54.820 --> 03:11:59.103]  Let me tell you who isn't under scrutiny.
[03:11:59.103 --> 03:12:02.625]  Let me tell you who really runs the show.
[03:12:02.625 --> 03:12:08.710]  Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Warren Buffett are wealthier than the poorest half of the U.S.
[03:12:10.233 --> 03:12:15.236]  And they're all fake liberals that want high taxes on American jobs because they're tax exempt.
[03:12:15.236 --> 03:12:19.319]  And there's another article right here, that's out of The Guardian.
[03:12:19.319 --> 03:12:21.681]  Monopoly critics decry Amazon amendment.
[03:12:21.681 --> 03:12:22.901]  That's out of The Hill.
[03:12:22.901 --> 03:12:34.449]  They're going to have a new, under this new Defense Authorization Act, Amazon is the only portal in these special government computers.
[03:12:34.449 --> 03:12:36.471]  That's why we want to make the internet for everybody.
[03:12:36.471 --> 03:12:38.292]  You can only go to Amazon
[03:12:39.892 --> 03:12:49.975]  For the government to buy paper, and batteries, and flashlights, and bullets, and... It's basically ending the bidding process.
[03:12:49.975 --> 03:12:55.537]  So Bezos, who's worth $100 billion, I guess he could be worth $500 billion, because he's CIA, his whole operation.
[03:12:55.537 --> 03:12:56.377]  It's admitted.
[03:12:56.377 --> 03:12:57.937]  He runs the CIA servers.
[03:12:57.937 --> 03:12:59.658]  I mean, this guy is a total frontman.
[03:13:00.981 --> 03:13:03.902]  And he's paying off everybody in the government while they're doing it.
[03:13:03.902 --> 03:13:09.404]  And he's just, oh, he's got these coffin apartments in Seattle where they overcharge the members of it.
[03:13:09.404 --> 03:13:11.444]  You don't really get a job there unless you accept it.
[03:13:11.444 --> 03:13:15.245]  It's just company store, man.
[03:13:15.245 --> 03:13:21.267]  It's classic fascism, and then it's like dipped in this bug-eyed liberal garbage.
[03:13:21.267 --> 03:13:22.948]  I mean, these people are devils.
[03:13:25.216 --> 03:13:27.376]  You'll never escape death, Bezos.
[03:13:27.376 --> 03:13:35.198]  I'm not threatening your life, I'm saying you're gonna face God and judgment, and you're not a god, and you're not gonna transcend us that you think is crap.
[03:13:35.198 --> 03:13:36.258]  You're crap.
[03:13:36.258 --> 03:13:38.998]  And so you've projected onto everybody that we're crap.
[03:13:38.998 --> 03:13:41.479]  You're crap.
[03:13:41.479 --> 03:13:43.079]  You think I'm gonna die?
[03:13:43.079 --> 03:13:43.879]  Spiritually?
[03:13:43.879 --> 03:13:46.760]  No, no, no, no.
[03:13:46.760 --> 03:13:51.340]  To quote Emperor Palpatine, YOU will die!
[03:13:51.340 --> 03:13:54.161]  Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[03:13:54.161 --> 03:13:54.461]  Not me!
[03:13:56.499 --> 03:14:08.009]  Not people that aren't out to get folks and, you know, don't come up with plans to screw everybody over and have slave factories and snicker around with your Apple buddies and all their slave factories.
[03:14:08.009 --> 03:14:13.173]  You know, they went after the Nike tennis shoe guy because he had some people working 12 hours a day in bad conditions.
[03:14:13.173 --> 03:14:14.594]  Okay, yeah, whatever.
[03:14:14.594 --> 03:14:17.837]  Paying them 10 times what Apple employees get in China.
[03:14:17.837 --> 03:14:18.998]  Or Apple contract slaves.
[03:14:22.243 --> 03:14:23.084]  Oh, look at this guy.
[03:14:23.084 --> 03:14:25.387]  He's got underpaid labors.
[03:14:25.387 --> 03:14:29.811]  Meanwhile, Bezos is just a demon.
[03:14:29.811 --> 03:14:33.114]  I mean, a veritable demon.
[03:14:33.114 --> 03:14:35.457]  And everything he does is not just tax exempt.
[03:14:38.410 --> 03:14:39.130]  You get a dollar.
[03:14:39.130 --> 03:14:40.351]  Look at that guy.
[03:14:40.351 --> 03:14:41.551]  He's insecure.
[03:14:41.551 --> 03:14:42.692]  He's weird.
[03:14:42.692 --> 03:14:47.213]  He wants to show you he's the boss because he's got fundamental daddy problems.
[03:14:47.213 --> 03:14:50.534]  He's got fundamental alpha male problems.
[03:14:50.534 --> 03:14:53.155]  He's going to show you he's the alpha.
[03:14:53.155 --> 03:14:57.257]  He's going to show you the water, the fluoride, the brain damage.
[03:14:57.257 --> 03:15:00.498]  He's a mutant and he wants you to be a mutant too.
[03:15:00.498 --> 03:15:02.819]  So get ready America and the world.
[03:15:02.819 --> 03:15:05.419]  Bezos is your God.
[03:15:05.419 --> 03:15:06.660]  Just look at that monster.
[03:15:08.857 --> 03:15:10.618]  Just a buzzard.
[03:15:10.618 --> 03:15:11.838]  A truce.
[03:15:11.838 --> 03:15:15.919]  His spirit animal is a carrion crow.
[03:15:15.919 --> 03:15:17.840]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[03:15:17.840 --> 03:15:20.241]  Tax-exempt, folks.
[03:15:20.241 --> 03:15:21.641]  $1.48 every package they ship.
[03:15:21.641 --> 03:15:25.562]  You, as a taxpayer, pay him.
[03:15:25.562 --> 03:15:28.964]  And now, there's gonna be a one-way portal.
[03:15:28.964 --> 03:15:31.404]  Government's not gonna be allowed to go out and do bids, anything.
[03:15:31.404 --> 03:15:32.965]  You're just gonna buy from Bezos.
[03:15:36.852 --> 03:15:42.121]  That way there's not any small companies that get any bids.
[03:15:42.121 --> 03:15:44.385]  But it's liberal.
[03:15:44.385 --> 03:15:46.048]  Monopolies are so liberal.
[03:15:46.048 --> 03:15:46.628]  Look at him.
[03:15:52.617 --> 03:15:54.578]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:15:54.578 --> 03:15:59.901]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:15:59.901 --> 03:16:01.482]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:16:01.482 --> 03:16:09.827]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:16:09.827 --> 03:16:15.531]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:16:15.691 --> 03:16:17.532]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:16:17.532 --> 03:16:19.693]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:16:19.693 --> 03:16:24.176]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:16:24.176 --> 03:16:26.377]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:16:26.377 --> 03:16:34.221]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:20:22.925 --> 03:20:24.426]  Ask me anything.
[03:20:24.426 --> 03:20:25.527]  I did a Reddit last night.
[03:20:25.527 --> 03:20:26.048]  Liked it.
[03:20:26.048 --> 03:20:27.809]  Thought it was informative.
[03:20:27.809 --> 03:20:28.470]  Some good questions.
[03:20:28.470 --> 03:20:29.371]  We're going to take your calls.
[03:20:29.371 --> 03:20:32.714]  Lee, Mark, Jason, Jeff, Ross, David, Chris, and others.
[03:20:32.714 --> 03:20:36.517]  Just to show how the media spins everything Trump does is bad.
[03:20:36.517 --> 03:20:40.120]  The Japanese Prime Minister does a few scoops and throws in the koi food.
[03:20:40.120 --> 03:20:41.241]  Trump does the same thing.
[03:20:41.241 --> 03:20:44.284]  The media crops the video to make it look like Trump did it.
[03:20:44.284 --> 03:20:44.504]  Only.
[03:20:46.380 --> 03:20:49.423]  The Prime Minister was playing golf with the President.
[03:20:49.423 --> 03:20:52.086]  Trump got ahead because he was winning.
[03:20:52.086 --> 03:20:58.232]  And Abe fell backwards out of the sand trap.
[03:20:58.232 --> 03:20:59.032]  Trump ignored it.
[03:20:59.032 --> 03:21:00.474]  The media goes, Trump was unaware.
[03:21:00.474 --> 03:21:03.337]  No, Trump saw it happen.
[03:21:03.337 --> 03:21:04.638]  She didn't make a big deal out of it.
[03:21:06.055 --> 03:21:08.457]  That's what, you know, men do, normal people.
[03:21:08.457 --> 03:21:16.525]  I guess an SJW would have had a helicopter show up and said, oh, you're, you know, somebody you're out and falls in a sand thing, you know, you don't make a big deal out of it.
[03:21:16.525 --> 03:21:24.372]  Again, they just take everything and just microscopically turn it into some big issue.
[03:21:24.372 --> 03:21:27.235]  And now we learn, people are alleging, that 35 years ago,
[03:21:29.016 --> 03:21:32.477]  Judge Roy Moore might have talked to underage girls.
[03:21:32.477 --> 03:21:34.097]  He didn't do anything sexual.
[03:21:34.097 --> 03:21:34.978]  They don't want to get sued.
[03:21:34.978 --> 03:21:37.058]  It's all been perfectly written by lawyers.
[03:21:37.058 --> 03:21:39.159]  They just say he was creepy.
[03:21:39.159 --> 03:21:41.820]  And Mitch McConnell's like, well, that's it.
[03:21:41.820 --> 03:21:42.820]  I backed the other candidate.
[03:21:42.820 --> 03:21:45.961]  I want you out.
[03:21:45.961 --> 03:21:46.981]  I want you gone.
[03:21:46.981 --> 03:21:50.382]  And I want all the other Republicans to resign.
[03:21:50.382 --> 03:21:53.203]  So we can bring America back to heel.
[03:21:53.203 --> 03:21:57.524]  All right, Lee, Mark, Jason, Jeff, Ross, David, Chris.
[03:21:59.602 --> 03:22:00.923]  Who should we go to first?
[03:22:00.923 --> 03:22:07.007]  Who has been holding the longest?
[03:22:07.007 --> 03:22:13.711]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Fort Worth, Texas.
[03:22:13.711 --> 03:22:14.332]  You're on the air.
[03:22:14.332 --> 03:22:15.893]  Go ahead, David.
[03:22:15.893 --> 03:22:17.053]  How's it going, Alex?
[03:22:17.053 --> 03:22:18.414]  I'm a huge fan.
[03:22:18.414 --> 03:22:21.697]  We know we're under attack, and I just want to say I love the show.
[03:22:21.697 --> 03:22:25.559]  I want to start off, I want to revert back to the Vegas shooting.
[03:22:25.559 --> 03:22:28.401]  First of all, the thing that really caught my attention was
[03:22:29.013 --> 03:22:36.975]  In the crime scene photo, when he's laying down, over his foot is a machine gun perched up on a stand.
[03:22:36.975 --> 03:22:38.555]  Now, that doesn't make sense to me.
[03:22:38.555 --> 03:22:43.296]  It's obviously staged, but what I don't understand is why people don't see that.
[03:22:43.296 --> 03:22:46.837]  People just look at that and are like, oh, it's the crime scene photo, blah, blah, blah.
[03:22:46.837 --> 03:22:49.238]  Well, look, they've changed the entire story.
[03:22:50.836 --> 03:22:52.337]  Eleven times.
[03:22:52.337 --> 03:22:53.879]  The whole thing's fake.
[03:22:53.879 --> 03:22:55.260]  There's not enough brass on the ground.
[03:22:55.260 --> 03:22:57.743]  There's reports all over the city of guns going off.
[03:22:57.743 --> 03:22:59.885]  Acoustics show just that.
[03:22:59.885 --> 03:23:09.754]  So if you're asking why they're covering it up, they're covering it up because they don't want us to know from the best intel we've got.
[03:23:09.754 --> 03:23:13.637]  This appears to be some kind of Islamic spillover.
[03:23:14.585 --> 03:23:22.947]  You know, the prince that's been arrested now and all this, owned a bunch of floors at Mandalay Bay.
[03:23:22.947 --> 03:23:30.089]  We don't know exactly what's happening, but we know the official story isn't true.
[03:23:30.089 --> 03:23:36.331]  With the ambulances at the Hooters, like, why were there so many ambulances down the street when there's 50 people getting shot at?
[03:23:36.331 --> 03:23:38.731]  Well, they're also unloading them out of the building and putting them in.
[03:23:38.731 --> 03:23:39.392]  I mean, they've been shot.
[03:23:39.392 --> 03:23:40.572]  No, there were shooters all over.
[03:23:41.462 --> 03:23:47.763]  And the best we can tell is there was some Saudi Arabian war going on, like we now see every day happening over there.
[03:23:47.763 --> 03:23:48.863]  And that's being covered up.
[03:23:48.863 --> 03:23:53.964]  Helicopters blowing up, deaths, big shootouts are happening all the time, a few times an hour.
[03:23:53.964 --> 03:23:55.344]  And it's all just getting swept under.
[03:23:55.344 --> 03:23:56.505]  I mean, it's in the news.
[03:23:56.505 --> 03:23:58.485]  Oh, this helicopter crashed.
[03:23:58.485 --> 03:23:59.565]  That one blew up.
[03:23:59.565 --> 03:24:00.705]  Oh, there was a firefight.
[03:24:00.705 --> 03:24:03.886]  But, well, this other person was found dead at their home.
[03:24:03.886 --> 03:24:05.546]  This prince is dead.
[03:24:05.546 --> 03:24:06.466]  I mean, it's on.
[03:24:06.466 --> 03:24:08.727]  It's the same deal.
[03:24:08.727 --> 03:24:10.587]  And you ask, well, why is it Trump releasing the info?
[03:24:12.557 --> 03:24:15.179]  That's a good question, but we are looking at it.
[03:24:15.179 --> 03:24:16.520]  Thank you, David.
[03:24:16.520 --> 03:24:21.805]  I don't mind if you ask me anything, but that's kind of a Vegas subject, and it's okay.
[03:24:21.805 --> 03:24:24.527]  But we are taking calls where you can ask me anything.
[03:24:24.527 --> 03:24:26.769]  You can make your own statement, too.
[03:24:26.769 --> 03:24:29.911]  But I'm still a good caller.
[03:24:29.911 --> 03:24:34.435]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in Florida.
[03:24:34.435 --> 03:24:35.276]  Jason, you're on the air.
[03:24:35.276 --> 03:24:36.437]  Go ahead.
[03:24:36.437 --> 03:24:36.917]  Hey, Alex.
[03:24:36.917 --> 03:24:37.698]  Love your show.
[03:24:37.698 --> 03:24:38.979]  Thank you.
[03:24:38.979 --> 03:24:41.541]  You were talking about the human-machine interface weapon.
[03:24:42.572 --> 03:24:46.054]  And there are whistleblowers out there about this.
[03:24:46.054 --> 03:24:48.035]  One of them I went to high school with.
[03:24:48.035 --> 03:24:49.496]  He was a year below me.
[03:24:49.496 --> 03:24:51.658]  And his name is David Voits.
[03:24:51.658 --> 03:24:54.039]  V-O-I-G-T-S.
[03:24:54.039 --> 03:24:54.679]  He's online.
[03:24:54.679 --> 03:24:55.700]  He has YouTube videos.
[03:24:55.700 --> 03:24:57.821]  He explains the entire program.
[03:24:57.821 --> 03:25:04.605]  And one of the doctors that you mentioned earlier is one that he references.
[03:25:04.605 --> 03:25:08.448]  And the technology is using prosthetics.
[03:25:08.448 --> 03:25:11.970]  They put a chip in your brain and you can control a prosthetic limb.
[03:25:13.445 --> 03:25:15.225]  And, um, he's been out there for a while.
[03:25:15.225 --> 03:25:16.806]  Which again, all has real uses.
[03:25:16.806 --> 03:25:27.508]  The problem is the Trojan horses that are in the TVs, the iPhones, all of it, they admit that they're, because again, they call anti-stress vaccines, anti-stress vaccines.
[03:25:27.508 --> 03:25:30.029]  They eat part of your brain.
[03:25:30.029 --> 03:25:34.830]  Where you don't have those high spiritual experiences, you know, where you don't have the endorphin experiences.
[03:25:34.830 --> 03:25:39.631]  Yeah, you're not psychotic anymore either, but you were given a viral lobotomy.
[03:25:39.631 --> 03:25:40.871]  But again, the way they're all
[03:25:42.153 --> 03:25:45.434]  Couching it is super dangerous.
[03:25:45.434 --> 03:25:46.454]  Definitely, yeah.
[03:25:46.454 --> 03:25:54.917]  And he goes in depth in this program, and I talked to him for a little while, a couple months ago, and he said it's, you know, above top secret.
[03:25:54.917 --> 03:26:03.139]  It's as big and as secret as the Manhattan Project, and they're using it on individuals throughout the country and probably beyond.
[03:26:04.062 --> 03:26:06.083]  And anybody can look that up.
[03:26:06.083 --> 03:26:09.165]  His name is David Voit, V-O-I-G-T-S.
[03:26:09.165 --> 03:26:11.446]  And he's been on George Norris' program.
[03:26:11.446 --> 03:26:12.326]  Well, let's get him on.
[03:26:12.326 --> 03:26:13.587]  I mean, it's mainstream news.
[03:26:13.587 --> 03:26:25.872]  They've got 50,000 plus people have had government funding for brain chips to control neurological activities, not just to stop seizures.
[03:26:25.872 --> 03:26:30.995]  My uncle's got a wire and a chip into his brain for epilepsy from a motorcycle accident.
[03:26:30.995 --> 03:26:32.255]  And boy, when it hits, he'll start having
[03:26:33.536 --> 03:26:57.438]  Seizure and his voice is like a robot's he'll go and I'll tell you it was really nice out there at the farm Okay, I'm better Well, hey, thanks Alex and Everybody should just pray for Zach in Florida.
[03:26:57.438 --> 03:26:59.260]  Hopefully he comes on again and gets out and
[03:27:00.345 --> 03:27:03.467]  He's out of that trouble he's in, but I'll definitely be praying for him.
[03:27:03.467 --> 03:27:04.247]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[03:27:04.247 --> 03:27:05.628]  Absolutely.
[03:27:05.628 --> 03:27:07.730]  Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's incredible.
[03:27:07.730 --> 03:27:11.092]  I mean, I don't, it's, it's just wild.
[03:27:11.092 --> 03:27:12.312]  But yeah, we'll try to get that guest on.
[03:27:12.312 --> 03:27:12.773]  Good idea.
[03:27:12.773 --> 03:27:14.594]  Thank you.
[03:27:14.594 --> 03:27:15.774]  Yeah, Zach gets out.
[03:27:15.774 --> 03:27:18.356]  He just said, here's my info, my lawyer.
[03:27:18.356 --> 03:27:21.918]  So you hear from them, you know, it's going to be all right.
[03:27:21.918 --> 03:27:27.802]  And, uh, he's, uh, last time I heard locked up in a military base, cause we're two days into it.
[03:27:29.994 --> 03:27:30.754]  Respect his wishes.
[03:27:30.754 --> 03:27:33.155]  Not to tell you his full name, but he's a known person in the military.
[03:27:33.155 --> 03:27:37.276]  Let's go to Jeff in Vancouver Island.
[03:27:37.276 --> 03:27:38.236]  Go ahead.
[03:27:38.236 --> 03:27:38.916]  Boy, is that pretty.
[03:27:38.916 --> 03:27:39.556]  I've been up there.
[03:27:39.556 --> 03:27:40.116]  Wow.
[03:27:40.116 --> 03:27:41.637]  Go ahead.
[03:27:41.637 --> 03:27:42.057]  It's great.
[03:27:42.057 --> 03:27:43.357]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:27:43.357 --> 03:27:44.858]  And thanks, brother, for running in your lane.
[03:27:44.858 --> 03:27:48.418]  I really, really appreciate you sharing your heart every day.
[03:27:48.418 --> 03:27:53.420]  And I just really agree with your assessment that, you know, this is a battle about good and evil.
[03:27:53.420 --> 03:27:56.240]  This is totally about Christ and the devil.
[03:27:56.240 --> 03:27:58.041]  And you nail it all the time with that.
[03:27:58.041 --> 03:27:59.581]  And God bless you for that.
[03:28:00.222 --> 03:28:10.049]  I just want to remind the church, you know, the victory is won at the cross, and you know, our champion beat their champion, and you know, we're walking it out now, but we are going to win in the end.
[03:28:10.049 --> 03:28:19.675]  You know, I just want to remind Christians, you know, we all got to take a fresh knee before God and, you know, instead of taking a knee for some other garbage and, you know,
[03:28:20.603 --> 03:28:29.167]  God has got love and power for all of us, and I just want to encourage everybody, get in your lane, run your race, and... Hold on, because here's the deal, here's the deal.
[03:28:29.167 --> 03:28:32.249]  I'm not mad at everybody, but nobody's doing the ask me anything thing.
[03:28:32.249 --> 03:28:33.870]  So stay there, Jeff.
[03:28:33.870 --> 03:28:39.893]  You make your finisher point, we come back, but then ask me anything, because that's what I... Occasionally the callers have got to halfway go the direction I want to go.
[03:28:40.834 --> 03:28:43.677]  But then Ross and Chris and Lee and Mark.
[03:28:43.677 --> 03:28:44.798]  But go through all these other callers.
[03:28:44.798 --> 03:28:47.360]  Find out who specifically has a question.
[03:28:47.360 --> 03:28:48.141]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:48.141 --> 03:28:48.622]  877-789-ALEX.
[03:28:48.622 --> 03:28:49.122]  We'll be back.
[03:28:52.199 --> 03:28:54.841]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[03:28:54.841 --> 03:28:55.842]  That's true.
[03:28:55.842 --> 03:29:00.905]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?
[03:29:00.905 --> 03:29:06.109]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty and guarantees.
[03:29:06.109 --> 03:29:10.312]  No stock market risk, no tax risk, and no penalties.
[03:29:10.312 --> 03:29:14.115]  Call Life Benefits if you'd like a free book about how this can be done.
[03:29:14.115 --> 03:29:14.415]  Call 702-660-7000.
[03:29:14.415 --> 03:29:14.815]  That's 702-660-7000.
[03:29:23.208 --> 03:29:26.409]  Want revenge on the common housefly?
[03:29:26.409 --> 03:29:30.391]  Well, after 10,000 years, someone has finally come up with a better way.
[03:29:30.391 --> 03:29:36.893]  The Bug Assault, a miniaturized shotgun, which utilizes ordinary table salt as ammunition.
[03:29:36.893 --> 03:29:38.714]  Non-toxic and no batteries required.
[03:29:38.714 --> 03:29:41.715]  $39.95 plus shipping and handling.
[03:29:41.715 --> 03:29:47.338]  Use discount code GCN and receive 15% off your purchase at BugAssault.com.

[03:29:53.968 --> 03:29:57.110]  America is an information-based civil war.
[03:29:57.110 --> 03:30:04.536]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[03:30:04.536 --> 03:30:10.160]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[03:30:10.900 --> 03:30:18.227]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[03:30:18.227 --> 03:30:26.434]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[03:30:27.174 --> 03:30:32.236]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[03:30:32.236 --> 03:30:34.357]  They are the anti-liberals.
[03:30:34.357 --> 03:30:47.741]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more patriot apparel at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:30:47.741 --> 03:30:51.723]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:30:52.663 --> 03:31:00.228]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[03:31:01.818 --> 03:31:12.646]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[03:31:12.646 --> 03:31:14.768]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[03:31:14.768 --> 03:31:18.771]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:18.771 --> 03:31:26.016]  I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine.
[03:31:26.016 --> 03:31:28.418]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[03:31:28.418 --> 03:31:31.040]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[03:31:31.240 --> 03:31:33.823]  My dad, with a little silver and iodine as well.
[03:31:33.823 --> 03:31:36.326]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:31:36.326 --> 03:31:45.516]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[03:31:45.516 --> 03:31:49.962]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[03:31:52.560 --> 03:31:55.982]  My fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with a very important message.
[03:32:11.590 --> 03:32:22.616]  Really, really good news is that yes, we're having to end the sale of 50% off on Anthroplex, but DNA Force, after almost four months, out of stock is back in stock.
[03:32:22.616 --> 03:32:24.577]  25% off our flagship product.
[03:32:24.577 --> 03:32:29.420]  Also, Biome Defense, the great probiotic, that is 25% off as well.
[03:32:29.420 --> 03:32:30.781]  So a lot of things are selling out.
[03:32:31.101 --> 03:32:38.106]  A lot of things are still at record sales, like Silver Bullet, super high quality colloidal silver is still 50% off.
[03:32:38.106 --> 03:32:42.209]  And there's other sales that are still going, but they're all about to end.
[03:32:42.209 --> 03:32:48.914]  Whether it's DNA Force, whether it's Silver Bullet, it's all available right now at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[03:32:48.914 --> 03:32:50.836]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:06.141 --> 03:33:07.984]  We are on the march.
[03:33:07.984 --> 03:33:11.149]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:33:11.149 --> 03:33:14.875]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:31.209 --> 03:33:38.412]  Well, we've heard of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but what about Invasion of the Creepozoids?
[03:33:38.412 --> 03:33:42.834]  Here's a clip of Kevin Spacey recently saying, I'm one of the good guys.
[03:33:42.834 --> 03:33:45.135]  What a creepy jerk.
[03:33:45.135 --> 03:33:47.336]  Is that one of your philosophies in life?
[03:33:47.336 --> 03:33:47.876]  Yeah.
[03:33:47.876 --> 03:33:50.097]  Just be one of the good guys.
[03:33:50.097 --> 03:33:50.577]  Yeah.
[03:33:50.577 --> 03:33:51.037]  Yeah.
[03:33:51.037 --> 03:33:52.038]  Just be one of the good guys.
[03:34:00.031 --> 03:34:04.713]  Man, he is a genuine psychopath like his dad.
[03:34:04.713 --> 03:34:07.335]  That is just the craziest thing ever.
[03:34:07.335 --> 03:34:08.355]  Can we play that?
[03:34:08.355 --> 03:34:13.578]  I'm ready to listen to just hear it, but for TV viewers, it's like he's not even a real person.
[03:34:13.578 --> 03:34:14.738]  Here it is.
[03:34:14.738 --> 03:34:15.479]  Going to go home.
[03:34:15.479 --> 03:34:17.580]  Is that one of your philosophies in life?
[03:34:17.580 --> 03:34:18.180]  Yeah.
[03:34:18.180 --> 03:34:20.361]  To be one of the good guys.
[03:34:20.361 --> 03:34:21.201]  Yeah.
[03:34:21.201 --> 03:34:21.441]  Yeah.
[03:34:21.441 --> 03:34:22.302]  To be one of the good guys.
[03:34:30.735 --> 03:34:33.798]  Man, he is crazy!
[03:34:33.798 --> 03:34:38.043]  And then you look at photos of his dad who thought he was Hitler with a Hitler mustache?
[03:34:38.043 --> 03:34:42.467]  And I mean, what the hell is going on with these people, man?
[03:34:42.467 --> 03:34:44.950]  And it's like Hollywood goes, oh good, you're evil and you're crazy.
[03:34:44.950 --> 03:34:46.031]  Let us recruit you in.
[03:34:48.953 --> 03:34:51.434]  You know, expanding on all of this.
[03:34:51.434 --> 03:35:02.418]  They're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off right now about Roy Moore and a couple of women, say, 35 years ago now, he said they were purdy when they were 14, 15, 16 years old.
[03:35:02.418 --> 03:35:06.020]  He didn't say anything sexual, just, you sure are purdy!
[03:35:06.020 --> 03:35:13.503]  And McConnell and the Republicans are just stampeding to freak out
[03:35:15.771 --> 03:35:18.253]  And to say, oh my God, get rid of him, step down.
[03:35:18.253 --> 03:35:26.718]  I wish you'd say that about the Clintons, or the Obamas, or the Globalists, or John McCain, with all their corruption, and all their sex stuff, and airplanes, and underage kids, and everything.
[03:35:26.718 --> 03:35:28.360]  But you won't do that, will you McConnell?
[03:35:28.360 --> 03:35:32.883]  Because they're all a bunch of Globalist crooks.
[03:35:32.883 --> 03:35:39.167]  Jeff in Vancouver, go ahead and finish your point, and then ask me anything, go ahead.
[03:35:39.167 --> 03:35:42.249]  Okay, Alex, the point I wanted to make was,
[03:35:42.796 --> 03:35:48.079]  You know, that we have a champion, we have won the war, and now we just have to walk it out.
[03:35:48.079 --> 03:35:50.121]  My question is this.
[03:35:50.121 --> 03:36:00.207]  You know, the quote, elites carry the narrative, and they actually carry the narrative by calling themselves elites, and then we call them elites as well.
[03:36:00.207 --> 03:36:00.667]  No, I agree.
[03:36:00.667 --> 03:36:02.048]  We should stop calling them elites.
[03:36:02.048 --> 03:36:04.770]  We should call them... Delete!
[03:36:04.770 --> 03:36:07.912]  Call them deletes, because that's where they're going to go in the end, is they're going to be deleted.
[03:36:08.570 --> 03:36:16.696]  I think we need to refer to them as that and trump the narrative and gain it over them that we win in the end.
[03:36:16.696 --> 03:36:17.317]  So what do you call them?
[03:36:17.317 --> 03:36:18.878]  The hijackers of civilization?
[03:36:18.878 --> 03:36:20.659]  The criminals?
[03:36:20.659 --> 03:36:21.780]  Well I say it.
[03:36:21.780 --> 03:36:24.802]  They call themselves the elite and they want us to call them the elite?
[03:36:24.802 --> 03:36:31.988]  I call them the deletes and I've been calling them that for a while because these people in the end are not going to be around.
[03:36:31.988 --> 03:36:36.851]  They're going to be taken out and we're not going to be spending eternity with these people.
[03:36:36.851 --> 03:36:37.852]  They will be deleted.
[03:36:39.304 --> 03:36:40.564]  All right, thank you so much for the call.
[03:36:40.564 --> 03:36:42.085]  Interesting points.
[03:36:42.085 --> 03:36:47.026]  We got Lee, Mark, Terry, Mark, Rose, Nelson, Chris.
[03:36:47.026 --> 03:36:49.807]  Does anyone have questions?
[03:36:49.807 --> 03:36:55.009]  How do I get help for indoor farms promoted?
[03:36:55.009 --> 03:36:56.349]  Hmm.
[03:36:56.349 --> 03:36:57.850]  Interesting question.
[03:36:57.850 --> 03:37:03.211]  State of Minnesota gaslight social politics.
[03:37:03.211 --> 03:37:05.632]  80 plus sealed indictments on Mueller.
[03:37:07.881 --> 03:37:12.263]  Does he know really who the left is?
[03:37:12.263 --> 03:37:15.005]  Soviet Union won or lost the Cold War.
[03:37:15.005 --> 03:37:20.528]  Q Clarence Patriot.
[03:37:20.528 --> 03:37:22.209]  What's Q Clarence?
[03:37:22.209 --> 03:37:28.372]  That's an old psychological or government designation for certain type of Clarences.
[03:37:28.372 --> 03:37:30.554]  Let's go to Lee in Tennessee.
[03:37:30.554 --> 03:37:31.434]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:37:31.434 --> 03:37:34.196]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:37:34.196 --> 03:37:36.237]  Good afternoon from FEMA Region 4.
[03:37:36.237 --> 03:37:36.537]  Yes, sir.
[03:37:37.817 --> 03:37:55.150]  Yeah, the Q Clearance Patriot posts have been going up on 4chan, and whoever's doing it, it's all anonymous there, so they're laid out pretty well, and it's this long series of questions with some statements in between about a current plan going on right now, and you just brought up the indictments.
[03:37:55.150 --> 03:37:59.172]  They're also tracking the number of indictments, so it looks like there's some kind of plan in play.
[03:37:59.172 --> 03:38:01.194]  I was wondering if you knew anything about it, debunked or what?
[03:38:02.995 --> 03:38:05.136]  There's a lot of good information on 4chan.
[03:38:05.136 --> 03:38:08.737]  There's also a lot of bad guys on there, because it's all anonymous.
[03:38:08.737 --> 03:38:14.340]  I'm not familiar with what you're... I mean, I know there's supposedly four other Silden Diamonds, one of them General Flynn.
[03:38:14.340 --> 03:38:17.081]  They're now harassing the rest of his family.
[03:38:17.081 --> 03:38:17.581]  What do you think?
[03:38:19.216 --> 03:38:22.840]  I've been watching it and reading it and some of it has kind of been prophetic.
[03:38:22.840 --> 03:38:36.736]  They've been going out since about the late end of October and it spoke of Saudi Arabia prior to what went down there and what we're seeing with these large amounts of senators and congressmen who aren't running for re-election.
[03:38:36.736 --> 03:38:39.880]  They're thinking that these people have been approached and basically
[03:38:40.652 --> 03:38:42.114]  They're low-hanging fruit.
[03:38:42.114 --> 03:38:45.820]  They're not the big shiny guys like McCain or something like that.
[03:38:45.820 --> 03:38:51.588]  So they're voting the wrong way and voting for things that we definitely don't want any part of.
[03:38:51.588 --> 03:38:55.895]  But they've been approached and told basically, you know, either you go away quietly or...
[03:38:56.015 --> 03:39:02.319]  Clearly that was going on, and clearly they're having to step down because they had bad approval ratings and weren't going to be re-elected.
[03:39:02.319 --> 03:39:11.384]  Now they've looked to make lemonade out of lemons, and are now saying, wait, if they get rid of all of us, Trump won't have a majority anymore in the House.
[03:39:11.384 --> 03:39:12.685]  What do you think of that?
[03:39:12.685 --> 03:39:15.247]  Well, I think that's part of some of these indictments we're seeing.
[03:39:15.247 --> 03:39:19.669]  I think, hopefully, some of these guys are going to get hemmed up for the stuff that's been going on.
[03:39:19.669 --> 03:39:22.071]  There's another guy, Trevor Loudon, have you ever heard of him?
[03:39:23.587 --> 03:39:24.868]  Yeah, he'd be a good guest to come on.
[03:39:24.868 --> 03:39:31.334]  He's exposing the Senate and Congress, the members that either have communist or ties to care in Islam.
[03:39:31.334 --> 03:39:40.002]  Well, I mean, listen, Saudi Arabia is one of the richest countries in the world, and they have been buying our politicians, and Trump is putting an end to that to a great extent.
[03:39:40.002 --> 03:39:42.404]  That's correct, especially with what's going on there now.
[03:39:42.404 --> 03:39:45.827]  They've hemmed up a lot of the money.
[03:39:45.827 --> 03:39:47.769]  And that's why they're panicking so hard right now.
[03:39:49.830 --> 03:39:51.651]  I think the funding's cut off.
[03:39:51.651 --> 03:39:56.894]  That ties right back into what Zach was saying, you know, about these terrorist attacks.
[03:39:56.894 --> 03:40:01.017]  They're running around with their head cut off because the funding's cut off now, so they're basically going rogue.
[03:40:01.017 --> 03:40:03.518]  What do they do?
[03:40:03.518 --> 03:40:08.181]  And that's why, oh by the way, I just got word during the break, he'd called Niko last night.
[03:40:09.491 --> 03:40:10.272]  I've been busy.
[03:40:10.272 --> 03:40:11.933]  Niko put it in my box.
[03:40:11.933 --> 03:40:13.494]  I didn't read it.
[03:40:13.494 --> 03:40:15.756]  They did let Zach out yesterday.
[03:40:15.756 --> 03:40:16.896]  He's getting a lawyer and stuff.
[03:40:16.896 --> 03:40:21.520]  He says once he's authorized with a lawyer, he's going to come on officially and reveal his identity maybe next week.
[03:40:21.520 --> 03:40:23.041]  But he's going to do it with the lawyer.
[03:40:23.041 --> 03:40:24.922]  So Zach is fine.
[03:40:24.922 --> 03:40:27.584]  I just get busy and didn't get... I got the note.
[03:40:27.584 --> 03:40:28.205]  I didn't read it.
[03:40:28.205 --> 03:40:33.388]  It was that Zach has been released by the Army and the FBI.
[03:40:33.388 --> 03:40:33.829]  Thank you, Lee.
[03:40:35.267 --> 03:40:36.088]  Great points.
[03:40:36.088 --> 03:40:37.489]  Really great callers.
[03:40:37.489 --> 03:40:38.410]  Who's up next here?
[03:40:38.410 --> 03:40:39.150]  Soviet War.
[03:40:39.150 --> 03:40:41.272]  Won or lost.
[03:40:41.272 --> 03:40:44.615]  That sounds interesting, but let's go to Terry in Minnesota first.
[03:40:44.615 --> 03:40:45.576]  Terry, you got a question.
[03:40:45.576 --> 03:40:46.577]  Go ahead.
[03:40:46.577 --> 03:40:47.078]  Hey, hey, Alex.
[03:40:47.078 --> 03:40:48.439]  I want to cut right to the chase.
[03:40:48.439 --> 03:40:52.062]  I've talked to you several times before in the past, and a lot of the crew, I buy a lot of the products.
[03:40:52.062 --> 03:40:52.703]  They are awesome.
[03:40:52.703 --> 03:40:52.983]  Thank you.
[03:40:52.983 --> 03:40:54.424]  I keep thinking about them.
[03:40:54.424 --> 03:40:55.145]  Okay.
[03:40:55.145 --> 03:40:55.565]  The left.
[03:41:00.993 --> 03:41:06.838]  When you understand Scripture, if you don't understand the First Earth Age, you're not going to understand Scripture.
[03:41:06.838 --> 03:41:15.004]  In other words, when you're told something like, you're one-third of the stars that haven't followed the tail of the serpent, what are we talking about?
[03:41:15.004 --> 03:41:16.566]  Well, what does Christ say we're talking about?
[03:41:16.566 --> 03:41:23.491]  We're talking about 4 billion souls, because the true scholars know that God created about 12 billion, so it's one-third.
[03:41:23.491 --> 03:41:27.695]  And He reserved these people to be born into this last generation,
[03:41:28.457 --> 03:41:29.578]  Um, why?
[03:41:29.578 --> 03:41:33.481]  Because God wants to see if these folks are going to go for him again, and a lot of them are.
[03:41:33.481 --> 03:41:38.065]  And that's why it's hard to explain who these people are if you don't understand the first earth age.
[03:41:38.065 --> 03:41:47.352]  Well, I'll tell you, these evil people, like they have a score to settle, and they're in a military, and they've got an operation, and they're committed to evil.
[03:41:47.352 --> 03:41:51.195]  And you see it, and it's like, this isn't culture, this is spiritual.
[03:41:51.195 --> 03:41:52.516]  They are really programmed.
[03:41:52.516 --> 03:41:54.417]  I mean, it's real.
[03:41:54.417 --> 03:41:56.699]  This is who these people are from the first earth age.
[03:41:56.699 --> 03:41:57.560]  That's why God said,
[03:41:58.524 --> 03:42:02.146]  I named you a prophet, Jeremiah, while you were still in your mother's womb.
[03:42:02.146 --> 03:42:04.408]  Well, what do you mean by that, you know?
[03:42:04.408 --> 03:42:07.350]  Okay, how about, Jacob I loved, Esau I hated.
[03:42:07.350 --> 03:42:11.853]  How could God hate Esau when he was still an embryo in the womb, right?
[03:42:11.853 --> 03:42:15.615]  Well, he knew him from the first earth age because Esau wanted nothing to do with God.
[03:42:15.615 --> 03:42:17.316]  Free will, just like Satan.
[03:42:17.316 --> 03:42:18.958]  Free will, that prick.
[03:42:18.958 --> 03:42:24.101]  I mean, he sucked, just like he got Obama, I mean, Hillary and Trump.
[03:42:25.199 --> 03:42:28.321]  Satan sucked one-third of God's children towards Satan.
[03:42:28.321 --> 03:42:33.424]  In other words, they liked his politics, they liked his system, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[03:42:33.424 --> 03:42:44.570]  And when Jesus Christ was weakened after the 40 days, and Satan comes to that guy, and he offered him, what did Satan offer Christ in lieu of his worship towards Satan?
[03:42:44.570 --> 03:42:49.913]  He offered him sage, he offered him the Lamborghinis, and the iPhones, the iPads, and Christ turned him down.
[03:42:49.913 --> 03:42:50.914]  Control over this dimension!

[03:46:38.097 --> 03:46:40.519]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:04.471 --> 03:47:11.017]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:11.017 --> 03:47:13.879]  By the way, Sean Parker's not perfect, but I think he has a soul.
[03:47:13.879 --> 03:47:19.064]  There's an article by Don Salazar up on Infowars.com.
[03:47:19.064 --> 03:47:28.292]  Ex-Facebook president warns app exploits psychological vulnerability, suggests social media platform rewiring minds, putting children's brains at risk.
[03:47:30.103 --> 03:47:34.447]  Well, that's because earlier this year, he's kind of doing a Donna Brazile there.
[03:47:34.447 --> 03:47:38.770]  Documents got hacked by British intelligence, I can let you know.
[03:47:38.770 --> 03:47:45.456]  But it ended up in the news that they target people and want to make them depressed and controllable and make them leftist.
[03:47:45.456 --> 03:47:48.298]  And that most of their friends are fake bots.
[03:47:48.298 --> 03:47:49.960]  One time I walked into a party in Austin.
[03:47:51.064 --> 03:47:52.404]  And Sean Parker was there.
[03:47:52.404 --> 03:47:54.625]  I'm not supposed to tell the story.
[03:47:54.625 --> 03:47:56.045]  Okay, I'm not telling the story.
[03:47:56.045 --> 03:48:01.906]  Because the person that took me to it said, you cannot tell that story, promise.
[03:48:01.906 --> 03:48:04.047]  This was like five years ago.
[03:48:04.047 --> 03:48:05.247]  So it wasn't anything bad.
[03:48:05.247 --> 03:48:08.788]  It's just, it's just ridiculous.
[03:48:08.788 --> 03:48:11.368]  You think Sean Parker had seen a ghost though, when I walked in.
[03:48:11.368 --> 03:48:13.889]  We'll just leave it at that.
[03:48:13.889 --> 03:48:14.449]  But, uh,
[03:48:15.714 --> 03:48:20.918]  Or like when you see the ghost in the old cartoons, they run through the wall, there's like a cutout of the person on the wall.
[03:48:20.918 --> 03:48:23.600]  But Sean Parker is there talking about that now.
[03:48:23.600 --> 03:48:24.041]  Boom!
[03:48:24.041 --> 03:48:25.542]  Infowars.com.
[03:48:25.542 --> 03:48:26.843]  So important!
[03:48:26.843 --> 03:48:29.065]  Oh, everybody lets their kids on it.
[03:48:29.065 --> 03:48:30.086]  Everybody lets them.
[03:48:30.086 --> 03:48:34.990]  Yeah, and then that's how they interface their friends, so the computer becomes their friend, then rewires their brain.
[03:48:37.691 --> 03:48:38.992]  And look, I'm the worst about my daughter.
[03:48:38.992 --> 03:48:43.817]  Like, please let me get on social network for just one hour to play at parties with my friends.
[03:48:43.817 --> 03:48:47.100]  And then Zuckerberg looks like he's under MKUltra mind control.
[03:48:47.100 --> 03:48:49.583]  The real photo's right here at the bottom of the article.
[03:48:49.583 --> 03:48:52.025]  Look at Zuckerberg's eyes, man.
[03:48:52.025 --> 03:48:54.467]  Let me tell you something.
[03:48:54.467 --> 03:48:56.930]  I wouldn't trust that guy.
[03:48:56.930 --> 03:49:02.195]  Look at the pupils, even have like jagged edges around them.
[03:49:05.367 --> 03:49:09.549]  I can tell you a story, you know, about that.
[03:49:09.549 --> 03:49:13.651]  But I don't think I'm gonna tell it today.
[03:49:13.651 --> 03:49:15.552]  Nice contacts, buddy.
[03:49:15.552 --> 03:49:17.452]  Nice contacts.
[03:49:17.452 --> 03:49:19.333]  Very nice.
[03:49:19.333 --> 03:49:21.614]  You're a nice person, aren't you?
[03:49:21.614 --> 03:49:30.818]  You're a very nice person.
[03:49:30.818 --> 03:49:34.040]  I got five skin jobs walking free, folks.
[03:49:35.290 --> 03:49:37.654]  That's the latest technology right there, folks.
[03:49:37.654 --> 03:49:39.056]  That's the little bot man.
[03:49:39.056 --> 03:49:43.945]  The little front guy that you see out there.
[03:49:43.945 --> 03:49:46.269]  That's their best technology right there.
[03:49:46.269 --> 03:49:47.972]  That's what we're facing.
[03:49:47.972 --> 03:49:48.893]  Gen 1, right there.
[03:49:55.882 --> 03:49:58.523]  That guy's got the look of a velociraptor.
[03:49:58.523 --> 03:50:00.503]  He's not trying to act like a murdering control freak.
[03:50:00.503 --> 03:50:01.983]  Let me tell you something, folks.
[03:50:01.983 --> 03:50:06.825]  That's pure genetic-engineered psychopath right there.
[03:50:06.825 --> 03:50:15.967]  I mean, that is the real deal.
[03:50:15.967 --> 03:50:18.187]  He doesn't want power over you.
[03:50:18.187 --> 03:50:20.168]  He doesn't want to hang you up and torture you for three weeks.
[03:50:20.168 --> 03:50:21.168]  He just wants you dead.
[03:50:25.123 --> 03:50:27.004]  Oh, I guess people have already noticed.
[03:50:27.004 --> 03:50:29.965]  Okay, well, let's... Yeah, HUMET's powerful.
[03:50:29.965 --> 03:50:36.509]  We've got the technology God gave us to beat these guys, but if people don't get wise to the program, we're gonna lose.
[03:50:36.509 --> 03:50:38.049]  I can tell you right now.
[03:50:38.049 --> 03:50:41.351]  And God will just start back over again.
[03:50:41.351 --> 03:50:42.031]  Look at that.
[03:50:42.031 --> 03:50:42.552]  Look at that.
[03:50:42.552 --> 03:50:48.494]  Look at that.
[03:50:48.494 --> 03:50:50.395]  That's total commitment.
[03:50:50.395 --> 03:50:52.656]  That's not a power trip.
[03:50:52.656 --> 03:50:53.217]  That's not...
[03:50:54.264 --> 03:51:03.329]  That's not a narcissist, that is a robot.
[03:51:03.329 --> 03:51:05.750]  And it thinks one thing.
[03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:08.411]  One word.
[03:51:08.411 --> 03:51:14.195]  Exterminate.
[03:51:14.195 --> 03:51:15.535]  So enjoy yourselves.
[03:51:15.535 --> 03:51:16.856]  And it'll put a little fake smile.
[03:51:16.856 --> 03:51:18.077]  It's learned a little fake smile.
[03:51:18.077 --> 03:51:21.118]  Like that android in Tokyo going, Hi, I'm your friend.
[03:51:22.913 --> 03:51:29.359]  He doesn't even... But when he's not doing it, it's like... All of a sudden... Hi, I'm Marv Zuckerberg!
[03:51:29.359 --> 03:51:33.062]  Right back to... Takeover program control.
[03:51:33.062 --> 03:51:36.205]  Enter virus.
[03:51:36.205 --> 03:51:36.866]  Depress enemy.
[03:51:38.792 --> 03:51:41.333]  Override enemy's life force systems.
[03:51:41.333 --> 03:51:43.614]  Track enemy's social operations.
[03:51:43.614 --> 03:51:46.356]  Prepare to integrate information into data.
[03:51:46.356 --> 03:51:47.616]  Reach system.
[03:51:47.616 --> 03:51:50.257]  Take control of all natural resources.
[03:51:50.257 --> 03:51:55.480]  Accelerate poisoning of population with electromagnetic radiation.
[03:51:55.480 --> 03:51:59.422]  Sampling, sampling, sampling, sampling, sampling, sampling.
[03:51:59.422 --> 03:52:01.443]  Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[03:52:02.383 --> 03:52:03.424]  There's all these idiots.
[03:52:03.424 --> 03:52:05.446]  I'm on the red carpet with Zuckerberg!
[03:52:05.446 --> 03:52:07.628]  I'm in the elite!
[03:52:07.628 --> 03:52:09.589]  It's fun to be part of it!
[03:52:09.589 --> 03:52:15.394]  It's really cool!
[03:52:15.394 --> 03:52:18.557]  And you think this guy?
[03:52:18.557 --> 03:52:20.859]  Oh, you want to be in the elite with this guy?
[03:52:20.859 --> 03:52:24.102]  Oh boy, doesn't that sound fun?
[03:52:24.102 --> 03:52:26.524]  And his fake crying and all the rest of it.
[03:52:33.444 --> 03:52:35.765]  See, he's upset all the time, too.
[03:52:35.765 --> 03:52:37.206]  He's just driven.
[03:52:37.206 --> 03:52:39.087]  They've got such big souls, they're so free.
[03:52:39.087 --> 03:52:40.547]  Kill, kill, kill.
[03:52:40.547 --> 03:52:41.968]  Dominate them, destroy them.
[03:52:41.968 --> 03:52:43.549]  Snuff them out, then I can live.
[03:52:43.549 --> 03:52:46.730]  And the only life he's got is kill them and you can live, Zuckerberg.
[03:52:46.730 --> 03:52:48.711]  Destroy them and you can live.
[03:52:48.711 --> 03:52:50.072]  Take control of them and you can live.
[03:52:50.072 --> 03:52:53.633]  And he's just always seeking, always.
[03:52:53.633 --> 03:52:54.874]  Can he just put your light out?
[03:52:54.874 --> 03:52:57.175]  If he can just put your lights out, then he can rest.
[03:52:57.175 --> 03:53:00.257]  But, see, the fact that you're alive and free, he has to get rid of you.
[03:53:06.407 --> 03:53:08.268]  I'm sorry, I'm being a little bit of a bad boy today.
[03:53:08.268 --> 03:53:14.012]  Let me see, Nelson in Georgia, how do you get help... I gotta hear this.
[03:53:14.012 --> 03:53:17.976]  How do you get help with indoor farms?
[03:53:17.976 --> 03:53:18.796]  I have no idea.
[03:53:18.796 --> 03:53:21.578]  Explain to me what you're talking about, my friend.
[03:53:21.578 --> 03:53:32.627]  I run the Help Make America Ready Gun Project for the Northeast Georgia Mountains, and for the past four years I've been trying to push indoor farming due to our environmental problems with the soil and water.
[03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:46.456]  And I go to every city, to the mayor and everything, and I try to explain to them the importance of why we're all unhealthy, and our kids are the way they are, and I'm not having any luck or making any headway.
[03:53:46.456 --> 03:53:51.678]  Well, if you just die, Zuckerberg will be able to be who he is, and then he'll be a real boy.
[03:53:51.678 --> 03:53:53.039]  No.
[03:53:53.039 --> 03:53:55.640]  That's what they're trying to do to us.
[03:53:55.640 --> 03:53:57.461]  But if you die, he gets to be a real boy.
[03:53:59.778 --> 03:54:00.879]  I don't want that to happen.
[03:54:00.879 --> 03:54:02.660]  Why don't you just die?
[03:54:02.660 --> 03:54:04.701]  Why don't you just die, Nelson?
[03:54:04.701 --> 03:54:07.923]  And then Bezos can be a real boy, too.
[03:54:07.923 --> 03:54:09.463]  That's what their daddy told them.
[03:54:09.463 --> 03:54:12.065]  Their daddy told them as soon as you're dead, he gets to be a real boy.
[03:54:12.065 --> 03:54:15.347]  That's right.
[03:54:15.347 --> 03:54:16.748]  Look right here.
[03:54:16.748 --> 03:54:20.950]  Congress hears ideas on altering clouds to offset climate.
[03:54:20.950 --> 03:54:23.791]  McClatchy, ooh, what incredible breaking news.
[03:54:27.512 --> 03:54:28.092]  Yeah.
[03:54:28.092 --> 03:54:30.134]  Well, Bezos backed indoor farming.
[03:54:30.134 --> 03:54:34.977]  Because you know the European elite, the Chinese elite, all their chefs indoor farmed.
[03:54:34.977 --> 03:54:41.962]  So the barium, salt, aluminum dioxide they're spraying on the rest of us to brain damages doesn't get them and their families.
[03:54:41.962 --> 03:54:43.463]  That's correct.
[03:54:43.463 --> 03:54:47.866]  That's why we have to, you know, we need to become self-sustaining communities again like we were in the 50s when we had health.
[03:54:47.866 --> 03:54:49.127]  But isn't Bezos better than us?
[03:54:49.127 --> 03:54:53.230]  You know, this is what I've always been told.
[03:54:53.230 --> 03:54:56.633]  The fact that they came up with the plan and did it and have such will.
[03:54:58.359 --> 03:55:00.319]  Shouldn't we just roll over and die?
[03:55:00.319 --> 03:55:03.740]  Because, you know, they came up with the plan.
[03:55:03.740 --> 03:55:08.441]  Doesn't that show they're superior?
[03:55:08.441 --> 03:55:09.481]  No, they're not superior.
[03:55:09.481 --> 03:55:11.401]  Because that's what they always tell me.
[03:55:11.401 --> 03:55:13.202]  They always tell me that.
[03:55:13.202 --> 03:55:24.464]  They all need to be in a brand new prison with 24 hours high definition cameras and we'll give them all they can care to drink and we'll put it on TV 24 hours a day and call it The Creep Show.
[03:55:26.516 --> 03:55:38.280]  Well, you know what they like to do for fun, so... These old boys, uh... You know most of them would die of their own volition very soon, locked up.
[03:55:38.280 --> 03:55:42.822]  Vampires don't do too good without blood.
[03:55:42.822 --> 03:55:48.304]  Metaphysically and physically, so... They would all switch off real fast.
[03:55:48.304 --> 03:55:51.885]  And, uh... Unplugged from their, uh... Their hosts.
[03:55:51.885 --> 03:55:54.746]  I mean, you know there's not much left with these old boys.
[03:55:57.725 --> 03:56:06.749]  They've done the damage to our environment already, but the radiation and the glyphosates and the, you know, Flint, Michigan is just a tippy iceberg when it comes to our water.
[03:56:06.749 --> 03:56:08.729]  You know, you know all this.
[03:56:08.729 --> 03:56:11.971]  You know, we need to, we need to fix our communities.
[03:56:11.971 --> 03:56:15.752]  The only way to do that is to start with a foundation of health and knowledge.
[03:56:15.752 --> 03:56:16.633]  I agree with you.
[03:56:16.633 --> 03:56:17.613]  I agree with you.
[03:56:17.613 --> 03:56:18.533]  God bless you, brother.
[03:56:18.533 --> 03:56:19.894]  Look at, look at Zuckerberg, though.
[03:56:21.971 --> 03:56:23.331]  Can we blow that up and put that on screen?
[03:56:23.331 --> 03:56:25.912]  That photo of him, he does that all the time.
[03:56:25.912 --> 03:56:30.334]  I mean, that's not him trying to act evil.
[03:56:30.334 --> 03:56:32.634]  Because if you look at it, it's total shark eyes.
[03:56:32.634 --> 03:56:37.616]  It's total laser commitment.
[03:56:37.616 --> 03:56:40.457]  The moment you are destroyed, he lives.
[03:56:40.457 --> 03:56:47.219]  And he is like a laser ruby cutting torch, just firing, just firing.
[03:56:47.219 --> 03:56:48.279]  And he is just committed.
[03:56:48.279 --> 03:56:51.760]  I mean, do people realize the manifest evil we're dealing with?
[03:56:54.758 --> 03:56:56.819]  And I'm not trying to demonize the enemy, folks.
[03:56:56.819 --> 03:56:58.579]  They are the enemy.
[03:56:58.579 --> 03:57:00.540]  We have their algorithm.
[03:57:00.540 --> 03:57:09.884]  It is to make you depressed, totally alone, so that he can ruin your mind.
[03:57:09.884 --> 03:57:12.685]  I mean, that's his goal.
[03:57:12.685 --> 03:57:16.966]  His goal is to wreck your mind.
[03:57:16.966 --> 03:57:21.968]  And even his former president has come out and said this thing is based on hurting people.
[03:57:23.368 --> 03:57:26.349]  I'd like to see Sean Parker hedge his bets.
[03:57:26.349 --> 03:57:28.469]  Good job, Sean Parker.
[03:57:28.469 --> 03:57:30.830]  How about you bet on humanity and come in for the big win?
[03:57:30.830 --> 03:57:35.771]  Because that's all I'm asking people to do is choose a side.
[03:57:35.771 --> 03:57:37.832]  Are you with these guys?
[03:57:37.832 --> 03:57:41.933]  Or are you with your ancestors and God?
[03:57:41.933 --> 03:57:44.574]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
