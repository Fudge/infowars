[00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:12.243]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:12.243 --> 00:00:13.303]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:13.303 --> 00:00:15.744]  This is going to be a very important transmission.
[00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:16.244]  Stay with us.
[00:00:16.244 --> 00:00:20.185]  Here's John Bowne's report on last night's historic speech.
[00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:23.986]  We are one people with one destiny.
[00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:26.767]  We all bleed the same blood.
[00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:32.169]  We all salute the same great American flag.
[00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.570]  And we all are made by the same God.
[00:00:39.528 --> 00:00:46.350]  When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began.
[00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.713]  The time for small thinking is over.
[00:01:12.713 --> 00:01:16.736]  The time for trivial fights is behind us.
[00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:25.242]  The cry-bullies on the left were shaken as they watched their globalist dream turn into ash before their very eyes.
[00:01:25.242 --> 00:01:38.613]  Intel, Walmart, and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.
[00:01:42.714 --> 00:01:45.836]  You didn't hear one thing that you can stand behind this morning?
[00:01:45.836 --> 00:01:54.242]  Look, I was touched by the mention of the widow of the brave soldier who died in Yemen and things like that.
[00:01:54.242 --> 00:02:02.167]  But no, it's hard to see any place where the president actually has done something for working people.
[00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:08.091]  We've ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.
[00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:15.013]  The office is called VOICE, Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.
[00:02:15.013 --> 00:02:19.395]  We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media.
[00:02:19.395 --> 00:02:22.976]  In its conclusion, I thought it was a very unrealistic speech.
[00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.357]  I thought it was very divisive.
[00:02:25.357 --> 00:02:28.038]  And I was saddened by the direction that it went.
[00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:33.841]  He came with no ideas or an agenda for the American people tonight.
[00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:37.382]  We are watching this president take
[00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:48.892]  People and dehumanize them in terms of immigration and those types of, in terms of the inner cities, when he constantly harps on Chicago.
[00:02:48.892 --> 00:03:02.399]  We know there are issues in this country, but to dehumanize people in certain communities is not the way to be commander in chief, the leader of this nation.
[00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:08.042]  He talked about bringing it together, but all we see is a constant division by this president.
[00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:09.618]  Where's the meat?
[00:03:09.618 --> 00:03:10.619]  Where's the money?
[00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:27.685]  Congressman Engel, who earlier today indicated that he would not shake President Trump's hand, a tradition that goes back many, many decades for you here in State of the Union speeches, speeches to joint sessions.
[00:03:27.685 --> 00:03:30.346]  Tell us about some of your thinking on that, Congressman Engel.
[00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:39.763]  Well, I've been appalled at a lot of the things that the president and his administration has been doing for the past 40 days.
[00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:47.567]  And I just felt that to go there as I have for the past 28 years and pretend it's business as usual,
[00:03:48.548 --> 00:03:53.071]  Would just be untrue and unfair and wrong for me to do it.
[00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:58.336]  We are supposed to have a free and independent press and freedom of speech, First Amendment rights.
[00:03:58.336 --> 00:04:01.558]  He bars the press from his press conferences.
[00:04:01.558 --> 00:04:06.463]  He singles out stations and newspapers that he doesn't like.
[00:04:06.463 --> 00:04:12.327]  When you're President of the United States, you know, you are there for the papers to write whatever they want.
[00:04:12.327 --> 00:04:14.449]  They don't just get first in line and nobody reads them.
[00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.433]  The Intelligence Committee says it's bull!
[00:04:17.433 --> 00:04:19.255]  Elliot Ingle, you damn liar.
[00:04:19.255 --> 00:04:20.858]  That was the Islamic Minions behind him.
[00:04:27.553 --> 00:04:38.662]  In terms of the President's speech, it was very disappointing that the only time he mentioned Muslims was related to Islamic radicals.
[00:04:38.662 --> 00:04:39.903]  So that was disappointing.
[00:04:39.903 --> 00:04:48.329]  No less than 23 Democratic Senate seats are up for re-election in 2018, along with two independent seats.
[00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:55.495]  If the Democrats continue to flap their elitist jaws, the Democratic Party may begin to border on extinction.
[00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:56.896]  John Bowne for Infowars.
[00:04:58.341 --> 00:04:59.063]  Start your engines!
[00:05:01.863 --> 00:05:06.324]  Just when you thought the progressive left couldn't sink any lower.
[00:05:06.324 --> 00:05:15.525]  Last night's Trump speech to Congress gave liberals yet another opportunity to showcase their ignorance and lack of respect for the country.
[00:05:15.525 --> 00:05:25.427]  Right after President Trump finished his historic address to Congress, the usual suspects, like Michael Moore, appeared on television to bash Donald Trump.
[00:05:25.427 --> 00:05:29.288]  This time for honoring, wait for it, veterans.
[00:05:29.608 --> 00:05:31.449]  I'm going to get an Emmy for this.
[00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.470]  Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch.
[00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.211]  I mean, this is the sickness of this man.
[00:05:38.211 --> 00:05:53.576]  Meanwhile, other liberals like Hillary Clinton volunteer Dan Grillo posted vulgar remarks on Twitter, calling the widow honored during Trump's speech an idiot, proving once again that liberalism is truly a mental disorder.
[00:05:53.576 --> 00:05:56.997]  I'm Darren McBrain, and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:02.467]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:09.071]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:12.232]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:12.232 --> 00:06:22.018]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:06:22.018 --> 00:06:22.858]  Caveman.
[00:06:22.858 --> 00:06:27.921]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:30.022]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:33.485]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:06:33.485 --> 00:06:38.629]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:46.775]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:06:46.775 --> 00:06:54.722]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:06:54.722 --> 00:06:59.385]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forestlife.com today.
[00:07:00.206 --> 00:07:10.759]  You're investing in your health and supporting the InfoWar when you visit InfoWarsLife.com and purchase your supply of Survival Shield X2 Nation Iodine and all the great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:16.666]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists, and the answer is clear.
[00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:19.129]  Iodine is key, is paramount, and there's
[00:07:19.209 --> 00:07:23.873]  There's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[00:07:23.873 --> 00:07:32.842]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.
[00:07:32.842 --> 00:07:36.745]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[00:07:36.745 --> 00:07:39.568]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[00:07:39.568 --> 00:07:43.632]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine,
[00:07:43.772 --> 00:07:44.392]  We're good.
[00:08:08.928 --> 00:08:21.995]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.995 --> 00:08:27.979]  Well, Donald Trump has certainly entered the danger zone.
[00:08:27.979 --> 00:08:36.744]  We have two more countries in Europe today announcing that they may begin the process of pulling out
[00:08:37.702 --> 00:08:40.203]  of the European Union.
[00:08:40.203 --> 00:08:59.732]  And we've got nationalists in basically every European country, northern, western, eastern, southern, winning seats in parliament and taking the pole position for big wins in the presidencies as well, as well as prime ministerships.
[00:08:59.732 --> 00:09:02.333]  And you see America leading the way
[00:09:03.965 --> 00:09:21.721]  In expanding this nationalistic self-determination of individuals and cultures through their countries in defense of liberty and in a fight with the dehumanizing globalists.
[00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:24.723]  Now there is so much to get to and cover here.
[00:09:24.723 --> 00:09:28.687]  Wow!
[00:09:28.687 --> 00:09:30.869]  What a speech yesterday.
[00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:50.407]  By President Trump, on January 20th, 2017, he became the 45th President of the United States and announced his intentions to right the ship of the United States of America.
[00:09:50.407 --> 00:09:57.353]  On February 28th, less than 45 days later, on February 28th, 2017,
[00:10:02.728 --> 00:10:15.224]  He took full command and began to actually right the ship and already, in just that little amount of time, we have already been taken off this collision course of collapse and the end of our sovereignty.
[00:10:15.224 --> 00:10:16.966]  I won't say he's righted the ship yet.
[00:10:17.927 --> 00:10:35.159]  Because we're in dangerous waters and surrounded by enemies but we have a lot of friends and humanity again is awakening right at the darkest moment as we do throughout history over and over and over again and history is repeating itself.
[00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:41.123]  I gotta tell you though, we finished up our live coverage at about 10.30 last night.
[00:10:41.123 --> 00:10:43.845]  I went home, brushed my teeth,
[00:10:45.273 --> 00:10:47.595]  Got a glass of water and climbed into bed.
[00:10:47.595 --> 00:11:13.437]  And I woke up this morning and I went to InfoWars.com, I went to DrugsReport.com, I checked the email, I looked at the Twitter, and it was just Democrats everywhere saying horrible things, nasty things, calling for Trump's death, making fun of Mrs. Owens who lost her husband, William Ryan Owens,
[00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:16.303]  And calling her...
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:23.143]  An idiot calling her stupid, calling her, you know, a fool.
[00:11:23.143 --> 00:11:26.905]  Michael Moore attacking Trump, saying he's fake.
[00:11:26.905 --> 00:11:31.328]  How dare him, you know, invoke the troops and use them.
[00:11:31.328 --> 00:11:40.633]  Trump has always, since he grew up as a kid, his dad was a big booster of the military, admired people that are in the military, admired combat veterans for their courage.
[00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:44.516]  He's a guy that's into being manly, being honorable, not being a coward.
[00:11:44.516 --> 00:11:45.756]  You've seen him on the campaign trail.
[00:11:46.817 --> 00:11:48.058]  You've seen him fulfill his promises.
[00:11:48.058 --> 00:11:50.299]  You've seen him stand up for what he believes in.
[00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:51.539]  He's an honorable man.
[00:11:51.539 --> 00:12:09.968]  And in a world of creatures like Chris Matthews and Michael Morgan slime bags, who are absolutely backstabbing hypocritical filth, who have bodyguards that don't want you to have your own Second Amendment, Trump gravitates towards folks that have been in the military.
[00:12:12.332 --> 00:12:29.363]  Just like anybody who's lived or experienced life knows that, on average, people that are veterans and people that have seen a lot of combat are more honorable and more serious and more focused than the jellyfish that populate this domesticated, spoiled, rotten nation.
[00:12:29.363 --> 00:12:31.684]  And I'm not calling everybody jellyfish.
[00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:33.686]  But let's all face it, every statistic shows it.
[00:12:34.306 --> 00:12:36.949]  We don't know how to skin a buck or run a trot line on average.
[00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:38.991]  We don't know how to fix a car or truck.
[00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:43.415]  We don't know how to roof our house or fix the plumbing or rewire stuff.
[00:12:43.415 --> 00:12:45.317]  We don't know how to plant a crop.
[00:12:45.317 --> 00:12:47.319]  We don't know how to kick ass.
[00:12:47.319 --> 00:12:53.005]  We don't know how to shoot a gun on average like we did our predecessors.
[00:12:55.063 --> 00:13:04.593]  So it's not putting us down so that we all feel pathetic or so I feel good, you know, bad-mouthing the fact that so many people in the country are domesticated jellyfish.
[00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:28.428]  It's an important fact so that we get up off of our butts collectively and start getting back to things that are grassroots and stop just watching television all day and stop just obsessing over Hollywood and all these stupid, you know, music so-called icons that are selling us a globalist agenda of cultural collapse by design.
[00:13:32.915 --> 00:13:33.616]  So it's that simple.
[00:13:33.616 --> 00:13:35.838]  And Trump's trying to get us back to our roots.
[00:13:35.838 --> 00:13:37.499]  That's not back in the past.
[00:13:37.499 --> 00:13:39.601]  Our roots are what grow into the future.
[00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:41.203]  The roots are the future.
[00:13:41.203 --> 00:13:53.235]  The roots are the cycle of birth, living, building, striving, having children, living, striving, dying, and the cycle over and over again.
[00:13:53.235 --> 00:13:56.438]  That cycle is under scientific attack.
[00:13:58.988 --> 00:14:04.189]  That isn't a statement bashing people that have a, quote, different sexual preference.
[00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:13.832]  The issue is, Target's lost $15 billion since they started pushing the transgender agenda and won't have a girl's section of toys and a boy's section of toys.
[00:14:13.832 --> 00:14:16.132]  And they're now trying to merge the clothing.
[00:14:16.132 --> 00:14:24.875]  That's a cult, taking what's normal and natural and trying to force you into, basically, cult jumpsuits.
[00:14:24.875 --> 00:14:25.795]  Cults always do that.
[00:14:27.173 --> 00:14:33.418]  Disney Channel Cartoon Features Network First Same Sex Kiss.
[00:14:33.418 --> 00:14:40.104]  This is for your seven-year-old, but notice it's not just that the boys are kissing and the girls are kissing.
[00:14:40.104 --> 00:14:48.531]  In the video we're gonna play, a boy and a girl are kissing and they feel alone because everybody else, see peer pressure, see it's peer pressure.
[00:14:48.531 --> 00:14:51.974]  It's not it's okay if a boy and a boy were kissing or a girl and a girl are kissing.
[00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:52.895]  It's no, no, no.
[00:14:52.895 --> 00:14:53.956]  Everybody else
[00:14:55.134 --> 00:14:56.354]  He's not going to procreate.
[00:14:56.354 --> 00:14:59.396]  Everybody else isn't going to build a nest and have children.
[00:14:59.396 --> 00:15:04.678]  Just like when you want to kill fire ants, you put in a system to kill their sexual reproduction.
[00:15:04.678 --> 00:15:09.119]  Or you want to get rid of any other pest, you shut down the reproductive cycle.
[00:15:09.119 --> 00:15:18.823]  They're saying, just like the cover of National Geographic, the eugenics publication, they have all the new genders, but not a woman.
[00:15:19.747 --> 00:15:21.748]  Not a woman with a uterus.
[00:15:21.748 --> 00:15:24.589]  Because that's the real power in the universe.
[00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:30.430]  That's, that's, that's God's big creation right there.
[00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.371]  That's a magic machine right there.
[00:15:32.371 --> 00:15:33.571]  No, no, no, no.
[00:15:33.571 --> 00:15:34.052]  See?
[00:15:34.052 --> 00:15:34.972]  What do they tell you there?
[00:15:34.972 --> 00:15:37.053]  Biomission.
[00:15:37.053 --> 00:15:38.313]  How do they lie to you, Biomission?
[00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:42.454]  They don't show you the woman.
[00:15:42.454 --> 00:15:47.316]  And right here, everybody else, you see,
[00:15:48.922 --> 00:15:49.743]  That's how that works.
[00:15:49.743 --> 00:15:51.664]  But they also trick it to make it look like it's two girls.
[00:15:51.664 --> 00:15:57.047]  But really, the archetypal image is, it's a boy and a girl.
[00:15:57.047 --> 00:15:59.149]  And you watch the clip, that's basically what it's doing.
[00:15:59.149 --> 00:16:01.390]  This is the system that's being sold.
[00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.632]  You think they care that they lost $15 billion at Target?
[00:16:03.632 --> 00:16:04.512]  No.
[00:16:04.512 --> 00:16:07.955]  Because it's a mission.
[00:16:07.955 --> 00:16:09.956]  It's a system of social control.
[00:16:13.703 --> 00:16:19.909]  Target is a social engineering company in their own corporate filings, and the retail is their side business.
[00:16:19.909 --> 00:16:23.332]  Look it up.
[00:16:23.332 --> 00:16:25.894]  Very, very sinister, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:25.894 --> 00:16:28.256]  Very, very hardcore.
[00:16:28.256 --> 00:16:31.919]  And you've got the Washington Post, fake news partner with the CIA.
[00:16:31.919 --> 00:16:35.382]  There's a big article by John Rappaport up on Infowars.com.
[00:16:35.382 --> 00:16:40.707]  $600 million publicly of taxpayer money given by Obama
[00:16:42.881 --> 00:16:51.588]  So Bezos can run around and engage in propaganda, and you wonder why the Washington Post puts out lies and put out a fake list saying ban InfoWars, ban Drudge.
[00:16:51.588 --> 00:16:54.330]  Then lawsuits got started, because it's discriminatory.
[00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.091]  Where's your proof?
[00:16:55.091 --> 00:16:56.212]  Where's your court of law?
[00:16:56.212 --> 00:16:59.094]  You're trying to shut me out of the market.
[00:16:59.094 --> 00:17:02.917]  You're trying to shut us out of the market place of ideas.
[00:17:02.917 --> 00:17:04.859]  So they pulled it down, but they don't care.
[00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:09.462]  AdRolls just going to use that list and ban people from advertising on the Google platform.
[00:17:09.462 --> 00:17:10.063]  This is how they
[00:17:11.203 --> 00:17:20.011]  Put you on those electronic gulags that Matt Drudge came here and warned everybody about 15 months ago, and now it's all come true.
[00:17:20.011 --> 00:17:22.393]  But, one thing didn't come true.
[00:17:22.393 --> 00:17:24.154]  Hillary didn't get in.
[00:17:24.154 --> 00:17:36.425]  So they're going ahead with all their propaganda, all the new TV shows, there's like four of them out now, where there's a woman president, and there's evil right-wingers trying to kill her, and evil talk show hosts that have got to be stopped, who talk just like this.
[00:17:37.614 --> 00:17:39.394]  And say you are the resistance.
[00:17:39.394 --> 00:17:41.135]  We're going to stop this female president.
[00:17:41.135 --> 00:17:42.095]  We're coming after her.
[00:17:42.095 --> 00:17:42.855]  We're going to get her.
[00:17:42.855 --> 00:17:44.836]  It's not just Homeland.
[00:17:44.836 --> 00:17:49.037]  There's a bunch of other shows everywhere.
[00:17:49.037 --> 00:18:03.320]  Rolling it out and all these books published where Hillary won and Chelsea takes control of the World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and we have a global government in their words to make us take our shots and make us eat our GMO.
[00:18:06.147 --> 00:18:09.210]  But see, it didn't go according to plan, did it?
[00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:16.617]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[00:18:16.617 --> 00:18:28.628]  So I want to walk through, and skip this break, I want to walk through the historic speech last night in a lot of other news, but it fundamentally shows the nastiness that Obama could say
[00:18:30.765 --> 00:18:41.112]  He supports the troops and the military, even as he dismantled it, even as he funded our enemies and tried to overthrow countries that were allied with the United States and allied with freedom.
[00:18:41.112 --> 00:18:56.723]  Still, the libertarians, the right-wingers, they never made an issue out of it when Obama, during State of the Unions and speeches, would single out the military, like you do in any country, people for service, and those that have gone above and beyond the call of duty.
[00:19:02.366 --> 00:19:04.508]  And it just shows, though, we have class.
[00:19:04.508 --> 00:19:05.228]  They don't.
[00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:08.431]  They come out and they say, oh, Trump doesn't really like the military.
[00:19:08.431 --> 00:19:10.812]  He's just cold-bloodedly manipulating them.
[00:19:10.812 --> 00:19:17.398]  You see, the reason Trump is winning is he does care about the people, and he's not just having rhetoric, he's doing it.
[00:19:17.398 --> 00:19:23.202]  When you turn the coal power plants back on and give everybody cheaper electricity, that truly helps everyone.
[00:19:23.202 --> 00:19:26.745]  When you don't let China and others have one-sided trade deals, that helps the country.
[00:19:26.745 --> 00:19:29.447]  When you get over a hundred companies
[00:19:30.933 --> 00:19:34.775]  Like Intel and Hasbro, and the list goes on and on.
[00:19:34.775 --> 00:19:39.658]  That's just the last week to announce they're coming back to the United States with trillions of dollars of investment.
[00:19:39.658 --> 00:19:41.959]  It's not billions and billions or hundreds of billions.
[00:19:41.959 --> 00:19:43.540]  Trump wanted to be conservative.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:49.463]  The stock market's already, and the president corrected me, I keep saying 2.3 trillion in the stock market.
[00:19:49.463 --> 00:19:50.664]  I looked it up.
[00:19:50.664 --> 00:19:52.425]  As of yesterday, it's 2.9 trillion plus.
[00:19:52.425 --> 00:19:55.527]  It's almost $3 trillion in the last
[00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:03.924]  Several months since he got elected.
[00:20:03.924 --> 00:20:19.838]  And even Bloomberg had to admit 90 plus percent of that money is coming from small businesses and small firms and people knowing they've got to get behind this and invest in the future of their communities, their states, their nation, their world.
[00:20:19.838 --> 00:20:21.179]  And I've said this for many years.
[00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:24.262]  We're rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:20:24.262 --> 00:20:25.603]  We're not promoting the U.S.
[00:20:25.603 --> 00:20:27.285]  military going around and taking over countries.
[00:20:28.632 --> 00:20:44.970]  We're promoting the ideas of our republic and the renaissance, exploding by example as they did before, and to be the shining city on the hill, and the world adopting our ideas of free open societies because it's superior!
[00:20:46.949 --> 00:20:50.571]  Imagine how powerful China would be if they adopted our system.
[00:20:50.571 --> 00:20:53.912]  We're trying to just get back to the revolutionary system.
[00:20:53.912 --> 00:20:57.434]  It's not the old 240, you know, two-year-old thing.
[00:20:57.434 --> 00:20:58.115]  Oh, it's old.
[00:20:58.115 --> 00:20:58.655]  No.
[00:20:58.655 --> 00:21:02.737]  It's the newest, slickest, wildest experiment ever.
[00:21:02.737 --> 00:21:05.198]  And it paid off.
[00:21:05.198 --> 00:21:11.841]  Like a slot machine that comes up, cherries all the way across.
[00:21:11.841 --> 00:21:12.802]  Boom!
[00:21:12.802 --> 00:21:13.162]  Victory.
[00:21:14.727 --> 00:21:19.890]  Royal flush, the Trump card, all of it's there.
[00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:26.553]  And so they then say, oh, Trump's empty, he's fake.
[00:21:26.553 --> 00:21:28.334]  Well, let's just say that's true, which it isn't.
[00:21:28.334 --> 00:21:32.616]  You're the nasty people making fun of a woman who we knew isn't fake.
[00:21:37.659 --> 00:21:58.716]  Mrs. Owens, who just lost her husband a few weeks ago, in raids that had been green-lighted eight months ago, when Trump wasn't even in office, by the Joint Chiefs, by the Pentagon, by Special Operations, and Obama said no on a target list of hundreds of targets.
[00:22:00.256 --> 00:22:03.297]  I knew about this before it was obviously even in the news.
[00:22:03.297 --> 00:22:05.337]  We talked to him about it on the air.
[00:22:05.337 --> 00:22:09.118]  The fact that Trump was going to move against terrorists, that wasn't a secret.
[00:22:09.118 --> 00:22:15.940]  And actually go after the command and control, not just fight them randomly in the field, wherever the cowards pop up.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:24.582]  And so Trump went to the CIA, he went to the Pentagon, he got his Secretary of Defense in, and within 48 hours they began attacking those targets.
[00:22:24.582 --> 00:22:28.383]  They didn't announce it in the news, like others would do in the past.
[00:22:30.493 --> 00:22:35.516]  And out of all those raids, what are they saying?
[00:22:35.516 --> 00:22:40.499]  Like, four people have been killed?
[00:22:40.499 --> 00:22:42.880]  I mean, that's what they signed up for.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.801]  That's what they wanted to do.
[00:22:44.801 --> 00:22:48.583]  So you get the liberal dad, he's upset, but the wife's not.
[00:22:48.583 --> 00:22:52.465]  She knows what her husband wanted to do.
[00:22:52.465 --> 00:22:53.986]  That's what he signed up for.
[00:22:53.986 --> 00:22:56.568]  That's what Trump signed up for and promised to do.
[00:22:56.568 --> 00:22:58.509]  Another promise delivered.
[00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:17.422]  So they try to steal someone that laid their life down to stand up against bullies, people that sell women into sex slavery, that cut their genitals off, that throw gay people off buildings, that blow up churches, that blow up non-radical Muslims, that run around bullying everybody.
[00:23:17.422 --> 00:23:21.825]  And the media tries to basically crap all over it.
[00:23:21.825 --> 00:23:26.188]  So let's go unedited to the raw clip here of Trump
[00:23:29.045 --> 00:23:39.976]  Shingling, shingling out the veterans and of course the fallen and particularly William Ryan Owens, the Navy SEAL that died in the Yemen raid.
[00:23:39.976 --> 00:23:40.317]  Here it is.
[00:23:41.257 --> 00:23:52.467]  We are blessed to be joined tonight by Corinne Owens, the widow of US Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William Ryan Owens.
[00:23:52.467 --> 00:23:59.894]  Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation.
[00:24:11.471 --> 00:24:16.455]  Now they're calling this shit honoring the widow of someone that died going after Al-Qaeda.
[00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:18.776]  That's what ISIS is.
[00:24:18.776 --> 00:24:21.378]  Okay, so she gets a two-minute standing ovation.
[00:24:21.378 --> 00:24:25.261]  She's thinking about her husband.
[00:24:25.261 --> 00:24:28.703]  And this is all extremely genuine.
[00:24:28.703 --> 00:24:29.163]  They say it's not.
[00:24:29.163 --> 00:24:39.631]  I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid.
[00:24:40.299 --> 00:24:50.003]  That generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemy.
[00:24:50.003 --> 00:24:55.106]  Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity.
[00:24:55.106 --> 00:24:55.486]  Thank you.
[00:24:55.486 --> 00:24:55.766]  That's right.
[00:24:55.766 --> 00:24:57.107]  They raided the main base.
[00:24:57.107 --> 00:25:01.989]  Commanding forces not just there but all over the Middle East and Africa.
[00:25:01.989 --> 00:25:03.530]  A command nest.
[00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.150]  And some people got killed.
[00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.872]  Probably because it was leaked by people inside the CIA.
[00:25:07.872 --> 00:25:08.332]  That's the word.
[00:25:09.704 --> 00:25:10.965]  Like they believe that.
[00:25:10.965 --> 00:25:13.746]  To try to set Trump up.
[00:25:13.746 --> 00:25:16.047]  Just like Kennedy and the Bay of Pigs.
[00:25:16.047 --> 00:25:19.548]  There's a civil war going on.
[00:25:19.548 --> 00:25:23.150]  So here he is comforting her, giving her the support of the tribe.
[00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.632]  And they don't want us to have an American tribe and a unified.
[00:25:27.632 --> 00:25:30.053]  They want us to be little globalist minions.
[00:25:30.053 --> 00:25:32.834]  They even are mad when he says we're America first in the speech.
[00:25:32.834 --> 00:25:34.055]  They go, no, we want globalism.
[00:25:35.609 --> 00:25:37.051]  Like Glenn Beck said.
[00:25:37.051 --> 00:25:38.953]  Oh, it's bad to say we even have a country.
[00:25:38.953 --> 00:25:41.236]  It's scary.
[00:25:41.236 --> 00:25:43.959]  There's so many traitors like you, Beck, is what's scary.
[00:25:43.959 --> 00:25:44.900]  Look at that beautiful woman.
[00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.162]  See her soul.
[00:25:46.162 --> 00:25:47.043]  She's lost her husband.
[00:25:47.043 --> 00:25:50.127]  This is all soothing her for a whole lifetime right now.
[00:25:52.955 --> 00:25:56.198]  Transmuting the pain into victory in a ritual.
[00:25:56.198 --> 00:25:58.420]  One of the oldest human rituals.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:03.245]  When the warriors don't come back, getting around the tribe and honoring them.
[00:26:03.245 --> 00:26:05.587]  Trump is bringing back all the ancient rituals.
[00:26:05.587 --> 00:26:06.788]  The rites of passage.
[00:26:06.788 --> 00:26:08.570]  This is powerful.
[00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.172]  This is cleansing.
[00:26:11.172 --> 00:26:11.953]  This is good.
[00:26:12.867 --> 00:26:15.288]  And of course, the devils don't like it.
[00:26:15.288 --> 00:26:19.269]  Oh, there's articles everywhere that I'm crazy and believe that witches are after Trump.
[00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:21.030]  You saw it all over the news last week.
[00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:26.632]  But Jones is crazy and believes in imaginary devil worshippers that don't like Trump.
[00:26:26.632 --> 00:26:28.392]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[00:26:28.392 --> 00:26:29.953]  Taking everything out of context.
[00:26:29.953 --> 00:26:33.894]  Same thing they do to Trump.
[00:26:33.894 --> 00:26:35.195]  Powerful.
[00:26:35.195 --> 00:26:37.795]  Keep going.
[00:26:37.795 --> 00:26:39.256]  And Ryan is looking down
[00:26:40.353 --> 00:26:41.534]  Right now.
[00:26:41.534 --> 00:26:42.655]  You know that.
[00:26:42.655 --> 00:26:51.242]  And he's very happy because I think he just broke a record.
[00:26:51.242 --> 00:26:52.503]  Totally off script.
[00:26:52.503 --> 00:26:54.544]  Trump doesn't follow scripts.
[00:26:54.544 --> 00:26:57.206]  That's why Trump's so powerful.
[00:26:57.206 --> 00:26:58.307]  He just goes with his gut.
[00:26:58.307 --> 00:26:59.708]  He goes with being real.
[00:26:59.708 --> 00:27:04.392]  He goes with that genuineness that you can't stop if the people get behind it.
[00:27:04.392 --> 00:27:05.893]  And the whole world feels it.
[00:27:05.893 --> 00:27:06.514]  And everywhere.
[00:27:08.578 --> 00:27:17.125]  They're announcing secession movements that are now taking control in Poland.
[00:27:17.125 --> 00:27:19.227]  In Hungary.
[00:27:19.227 --> 00:27:21.269]  There are even movements in Turkey that went out of the EU.
[00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:22.910]  Good.
[00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:27.374]  There are movements now taking control in the Netherlands.
[00:27:27.374 --> 00:27:28.735]  In the lead to be the new president.
[00:27:28.735 --> 00:27:29.756]  Same thing in France.
[00:27:29.756 --> 00:27:30.676]  Way in the lead.
[00:27:30.676 --> 00:27:32.278]  Le Pen.
[00:27:32.278 --> 00:27:33.199]  Gert Wilders.
[00:27:33.199 --> 00:27:34.620]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:27:35.742 --> 00:27:39.263]  But they try to make it look dirty, and weird, and evil.
[00:27:39.263 --> 00:27:52.225]  And coming up, we're going to play the clip where they're just, it's horrible, and the Democrats wouldn't even stand when he talked about doing things for America, and building infrastructure here, not overseas, and getting our shop in order.
[00:27:52.225 --> 00:27:53.885]  Oh no, they can't stand for that.
[00:27:53.885 --> 00:27:56.046]  Or talking about getting jobs for Americans.
[00:27:56.046 --> 00:27:56.866]  Or veterans.
[00:27:56.866 --> 00:27:58.766]  The Democrats can't stand for that.
[00:27:58.766 --> 00:28:01.827]  And they look like spoiled, rotten, mentally ill babies.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:11.428]  Now let's go to a really truly wicked person who knows what he's doing, and that's Michael Moore.
[00:28:11.428 --> 00:28:12.389]  Michael Moore.
[00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:18.736]  Let's go to Michael Moore on the guy that says he gets sexually excited when he sees Obama.
[00:28:20.742 --> 00:28:25.425]  Chris Matthews talking about Trump being an opportunist.
[00:28:25.425 --> 00:28:27.906]  How dare him bring up the veterans.
[00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:28.927]  Here we go.
[00:28:28.927 --> 00:28:34.130]  A very poignant moment about the widow who looked like a wonderful person, very in love with her husband, she lost.
[00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.532]  And he says, well, he'll be happy up there in heaven how many minutes of applause he got.
[00:28:38.558 --> 00:28:41.060]  Was that something strange?
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:51.886]  Ryan Owens, his death came as a result of a dinner Trump had with his son-in-law and a political hack.
[00:28:51.886 --> 00:28:54.208]  He made a decision over dinner with Bannon and Jared.
[00:29:00.103 --> 00:29:02.125]  And then denied having a role in it.
[00:29:02.125 --> 00:29:09.992]  And then the reporting here on NBC News and other networks and papers of how the intelligence community said we got nothing out of this.
[00:29:09.992 --> 00:29:11.373]  That's what happens.
[00:29:11.373 --> 00:29:12.995]  I'm not going to hold him against that.
[00:29:12.995 --> 00:29:14.616]  It's just he can't.
[00:29:14.616 --> 00:29:19.000]  But then why tonight to say, oh, we got all this treasure trove.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.022]  And using the will.
[00:29:21.022 --> 00:29:22.383]  But he was sent to be the argument.
[00:29:22.543 --> 00:29:23.183]  Yeah, of course he does.
[00:29:23.183 --> 00:29:24.324]  Whether it was a valuable mission or not.
[00:29:24.324 --> 00:29:25.244]  Yeah, of course.
[00:29:25.244 --> 00:29:27.685]  And that's why she's there.
[00:29:27.685 --> 00:29:31.706]  As a sort of a pew to the people who are criticizing him for this.
[00:29:31.706 --> 00:29:36.908]  And this poor woman, this widow, who has lost her husband, she is in desperate grief right now.
[00:29:36.908 --> 00:29:38.028]  She's in love with her husband still.
[00:29:38.028 --> 00:29:39.029]  And in love with her husband.
[00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:40.089]  And what did you think of that?
[00:29:40.089 --> 00:29:42.590]  And to use that to put another notch on his belt.
[00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:43.690]  And what's he thinking about?
[00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:44.751]  My ratings.
[00:29:44.751 --> 00:29:48.752]  We're going to come back and expose this lying pig on the other side.
[00:29:49.915 --> 00:29:53.841]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.841 --> 00:29:56.525]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.903 --> 00:30:06.365]  Just when you thought the progressive left couldn't sink any lower.
[00:30:06.365 --> 00:30:15.569]  Last night's Trump speech to Congress gave liberals yet another opportunity to showcase their ignorance and lack of respect for the country.
[00:30:15.569 --> 00:30:25.474]  Right after President Trump finished his historic address to Congress, the usual suspects, like Michael Moore, appeared on television to bash Donald Trump.
[00:30:25.474 --> 00:30:29.356]  This time for honoring, wait for it, veterans.
[00:30:29.776 --> 00:30:31.497]  I'm going to get an Emmy for this.
[00:30:31.497 --> 00:30:35.498]  Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch.
[00:30:35.498 --> 00:30:38.259]  I mean, this is the sickness of this man.
[00:30:38.259 --> 00:30:53.624]  Meanwhile, other liberals like Hillary Clinton volunteer Dan Grillo posted vulgar remarks on Twitter calling the widow honored during Trump's speech an idiot, proving once again that liberalism is truly a mental disorder.
[00:30:53.624 --> 00:30:57.466]  I'm Darren McBrain, and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:02.226]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:02.226 --> 00:31:04.248]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:04.248 --> 00:31:07.050]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:13.215]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:13.215 --> 00:31:20.580]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.401]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:22.401 --> 00:31:29.923]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:29.923 --> 00:31:37.966]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:37.966 --> 00:31:38.906]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:40.129 --> 00:31:43.513]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:43.513 --> 00:31:47.658]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:47.658 --> 00:31:54.367]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:54.367 --> 00:31:58.472]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:00.717 --> 00:32:02.558]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:32:02.558 --> 00:32:09.159]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:32:09.159 --> 00:32:12.320]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:22.103]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:32:22.103 --> 00:32:22.943]  Caveman.
[00:32:22.943 --> 00:32:28.004]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:32:28.004 --> 00:32:30.125]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:32:30.425 --> 00:32:33.587]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:32:33.587 --> 00:32:38.731]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:32:38.731 --> 00:32:46.877]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:32:46.877 --> 00:32:54.823]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:32:54.823 --> 00:32:59.467]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLive.com today.
[00:33:15.638 --> 00:33:18.341]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:18.341 --> 00:33:28.591]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:28.591 --> 00:33:32.455]  Ted Malik, who is Donald Trump's nominee to be the U.S.
[00:33:32.455 --> 00:33:33.776]  Ambassador to the European Union,
[00:33:35.268 --> 00:33:45.957]  Definitely has the pedigree and the background for the job, but it's all over the news that they may veto it at the EU, which they have the power to do, and not accept Trump's ambassador.
[00:33:47.375 --> 00:33:58.998]  Well, he's going to be joining us coming up in the second hour with Dr. Jerome Corsi to give you the inside scoop on what's happening with the president's top nominee and one of the most important ambassadorships.
[00:33:58.998 --> 00:34:03.459]  It's probably the most important after the UN ambassadorship.
[00:34:03.459 --> 00:34:05.220]  So that is coming up.
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.240]  I'd say thirdly, probably China.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:09.141]  Fourth would be Russia.
[00:34:09.141 --> 00:34:13.622]  And then it goes down the list from there.
[00:34:15.185 --> 00:34:15.665]  Very important.
[00:34:15.665 --> 00:34:18.606]  The Mexican ambassador, I'd say, is about the 10th most important U.S.
[00:34:18.606 --> 00:34:19.726]  ambassador to Mexico.
[00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:21.846]  And these are all very important.
[00:34:21.846 --> 00:34:28.408]  And the EU is saying they want to block it, even though he has posted some of the biggest globalist confabs there are.
[00:34:28.408 --> 00:34:29.628]  People say, oh, well, that's terrible.
[00:34:29.628 --> 00:34:31.589]  But he's been a nationalist all along.
[00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:33.149]  He's given all the intel to Trump.
[00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:37.230]  That's how Trump knows how to dynamite their operations.
[00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:38.970]  That's why the globalists don't want him.
[00:34:38.970 --> 00:34:41.511]  That's why the globalists are fighting with everything they've got.
[00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:41.551]  OK.
[00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:49.792]  Let's start getting into all this.
[00:34:49.792 --> 00:34:54.175]  We also have James O'Keefe with big breaking news of the Veritas Project.
[00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:56.736]  Project Veritas joining us.
[00:34:56.736 --> 00:35:00.358]  This Michael Moore thing, if you just tuned in, I know every second a lot of folks are tuning in.
[00:35:00.358 --> 00:35:10.604]  We just played a sickening clip from Hardball with slimeball Chris Matthews and Moore is turning reality upside down.
[00:35:12.222 --> 00:35:18.146]  It's the Democrats that ran around saying that the Yemen raid was a failure when it wasn't.
[00:35:18.146 --> 00:35:29.194]  It's the Democrats running around saying Trump's doing this politically, going after hundreds of Al-Qaeda, ISIS, slash Al-Nusra sites all over the Middle East and Africa.
[00:35:29.194 --> 00:35:32.116]  And some inside the United States, but nobody knows about that, obviously.
[00:35:32.116 --> 00:35:33.617]  Oops, I guess somebody does.
[00:35:33.617 --> 00:35:35.158]  Believe me, the terrorists already do.
[00:35:35.158 --> 00:35:37.240]  So I can tell you, I guess most of these operations are already over.
[00:35:40.319 --> 00:35:49.183]  These are all targets that the Pentagon, the CIA, the Patriots inside had targeted and knew were real groups.
[00:35:49.183 --> 00:35:54.346]  And Obama let a lot of these groups into the country to do Lord knows what, I guess sleeper cells.
[00:35:54.346 --> 00:35:59.348]  I mean, no, he and his cousin and people are literally behind the Muslim Brotherhood and the overthrow of Egypt.
[00:35:59.348 --> 00:36:01.069]  And our government, CNN, backed that.
[00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:03.890]  I mean, and they blew up hundreds of churches, hundreds.
[00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.952]  Crucified Christians upside down at the Capitol building.
[00:36:08.632 --> 00:36:10.754]  That's the kind of people Obama runs with.
[00:36:10.754 --> 00:36:17.441]  So, this got so crazy that even our corrupt government, believe me it's corrupt, said this is way too far.
[00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:22.605]  You really are going to have a fifth column of Muslims linking up with the commies and socialists to have a war?
[00:36:24.667 --> 00:36:28.490]  A lot of people were really just mercenaries inside the system.
[00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:32.252]  They said the patriots are going to fight that and we're going to lose, so we're not going to do it.
[00:36:32.252 --> 00:36:37.916]  Oh yeah, a lot of these decisions were not made out of moral stuff at the very highest levels.
[00:36:37.916 --> 00:36:49.344]  It was done because they could read the tea leaves and see how crazy Nancy Pelosi and all these people are that really thought they'd bring in some young strapping Muslims to kick Europe and the US's ass.
[00:36:50.305 --> 00:37:02.906]  I mean, once you really start suicide bombings every day and mass shootings every day, it's... all of you are going to be prasada non grata on this planet.
[00:37:05.421 --> 00:37:15.349]  Now there were a lot of good page reads in the government and other corporations and groups all over the world that see this globalist plan and now know how evil it is and have gone and read the writings of the globalists.
[00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:16.750]  We've popularized a lot of those.
[00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.372]  I can say our audience has helped get that info out.
[00:37:19.372 --> 00:37:30.841]  I always believed that if we told people what was happening in the world and exposed the globalists in their own words and how diabolical it was, that people would unify and wake up and start resisting it.
[00:37:31.752 --> 00:37:35.416]  That's why they always denied it existed, even though it was being built in plain view.
[00:37:35.416 --> 00:37:35.976]  And guess what?
[00:37:35.976 --> 00:37:37.357]  Common sense prevailed.
[00:37:37.357 --> 00:37:40.661]  So many people thought I was a fear monger.
[00:37:40.661 --> 00:37:44.424]  They thought I was saying all this just to be listenable.
[00:37:44.424 --> 00:37:49.009]  And that people were cowards and would hear this and hide under their beds.
[00:37:49.009 --> 00:37:52.912]  Some people hid under their beds, but the people that counted didn't.
[00:37:52.912 --> 00:37:54.234]  And so we've just begun to fight.
[00:37:55.834 --> 00:37:59.317]  Now the enemy's out in the open saying world government's good and we should all just accept it.
[00:37:59.317 --> 00:38:00.538]  So what if it's unelected?
[00:38:00.538 --> 00:38:01.799]  See how far we've come?
[00:38:01.799 --> 00:38:03.840]  Everybody knows the Federal Reserve's private.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.201]  Trump's taking control of it.
[00:38:05.201 --> 00:38:08.303]  Ordering him to loan money to small businesses and individuals.
[00:38:08.303 --> 00:38:12.607]  Ordering him to loan massive money to cities and counties and folks that follow initiatives to hire American.
[00:38:14.753 --> 00:38:19.274]  You're about to see the power of a big fat state turned loose to actually empower people.
[00:38:19.274 --> 00:38:33.137]  That's why they are particularly angry because everything they built to screw us over is being taken away to re-empower us and then be dismantled and handed back to the states and the people.
[00:38:33.137 --> 00:38:34.037]  It's so good!
[00:38:34.037 --> 00:38:35.117]  It's so beautiful!
[00:38:35.117 --> 00:38:36.398]  It's so pure!
[00:38:36.398 --> 00:38:37.638]  It's so winner!
[00:38:39.028 --> 00:38:40.529]  We're going to win, win, win.
[00:38:40.529 --> 00:38:44.510]  You're going to have so much winning, you're going to say, please stop the winning, it's too much.
[00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:45.270]  I'm going to say no!
[00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:49.492]  Because the truth is, winning like this is going to be a great responsibility.
[00:38:49.492 --> 00:39:03.978]  And to not use the incredible power the United States is about to have again, times 100, and not let that be turned towards evil, but turned towards truly promoting human dignity and freedom on the next level for our species and all the advances that Trump
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:12.625]  Started to talk about again in science and technology and medicine that are right around the corner and you look in his eyes, they already got him.
[00:39:12.625 --> 00:39:19.789]  They just don't know how to deploy him yet.
[00:39:19.789 --> 00:39:30.716]  Trump's sitting there in the White House going, they've got all these cancer cures and all this and they instead are running a eugenics program with fluoride in the water and the vaccines with the additives to brain damage people.
[00:39:30.716 --> 00:39:32.377]  What the hell have people been thinking?
[00:39:35.814 --> 00:39:45.643]  Notice Trump's even more hardcore and more focused now, because everything he'd read about and heard about and been told about in behind-the-scenes channels, he now knows is all true and worse than he thought.
[00:39:45.643 --> 00:39:50.287]  And he's like, good God, we gotta shut this cancer down.
[00:39:50.287 --> 00:39:51.829]  And the cancer's freaking out.
[00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:56.153]  So Michael Moore, in the clip I just played, is saying, oh, at dinner,
[00:39:57.773 --> 00:40:01.498]  And they just make up news reports where there's spies and people listening.
[00:40:01.498 --> 00:40:03.381]  Oh, he had well-done steak and ketchup.
[00:40:03.381 --> 00:40:04.403]  Not even true.
[00:40:04.403 --> 00:40:09.250]  Or, oh, he was looking at classified stuff with the Japanese Prime Minister minutes after the missile launch.
[00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:10.652]  They were looking at news reports.
[00:40:10.652 --> 00:40:12.354]  Then they went behind closed doors for classified media.
[00:40:13.334 --> 00:40:14.495]  Everything's a lie.
[00:40:14.495 --> 00:40:21.420]  Oh, he's at dinner with his son-in-law and Bannon and they decide to go after these Al-Qaeda and ISIS targets.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.521]  He told you in the campaign he was.
[00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:30.486]  He was advised by the former head of Defense Intelligence that knew about all the targets and all the planning between all the agencies.
[00:40:30.486 --> 00:40:34.189]  That was Flynn's job, was to have a bird's-eye view of the whole deal.
[00:40:34.189 --> 00:40:35.690]  Just like Director of National Intelligence.
[00:40:39.465 --> 00:40:47.791]  But they just say, oh, Trump, you know, just decided at dinner, just randomly to go attack Yemen, and then some people got killed.
[00:40:47.791 --> 00:40:48.431]  Imagine that.
[00:40:48.431 --> 00:40:54.056]  They sign up for these dangerous missions, they signed up to be commandos, and some people get killed.
[00:40:54.056 --> 00:40:56.277]  Boy, I don't think they knew that's what they signed up for!
[00:40:56.277 --> 00:41:03.622]  Because they know they're talking to their coward audience of MSNBC and CNBC.
[00:41:03.622 --> 00:41:06.665]  They're talking to that coward audience that's like, yeah, they signed up.
[00:41:07.455 --> 00:41:09.455]  To be on the welfare rolls of the Navy SEALs.
[00:41:09.455 --> 00:41:19.457]  They signed up for Delta Force and, you know, the Army Rangers and the Green Berets and Marine Force Recon so people would wipe their noses for them.
[00:41:19.457 --> 00:41:35.900]  Then they try to steal the glory of the fallen soldier, of the sailor, and then turn it around that Trump's opportunistic and Trump doesn't care and Trump's bad and how dare them have this widow here.
[00:41:37.217 --> 00:41:38.598]  Sickening!
[00:41:38.598 --> 00:41:40.979]  And then, of course, he says, hey, you just broke a record.
[00:41:40.979 --> 00:41:42.040]  They're trying to say ratings.
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.462]  No, he meant for the longest standing ovation.
[00:41:46.462 --> 00:41:55.887]  He was trying to make her feel good, and it was so genuine, it was so real, and they hate that charisma.
[00:41:55.887 --> 00:42:00.369]  So, I mean, I've got so much important news to cover, but if you understand this, you understand everything.
[00:42:00.369 --> 00:42:02.470]  Let's go ahead and play the end of that clip we didn't get to.
[00:42:03.533 --> 00:42:05.193]  No, but then why tonight?
[00:42:05.193 --> 00:42:05.753]  Yeah, I know.
[00:42:05.753 --> 00:42:08.634]  To say, oh, we got all this treasure trove.
[00:42:08.634 --> 00:42:10.314]  And using the will.
[00:42:10.314 --> 00:42:11.255]  Let me back that up again.
[00:42:11.255 --> 00:42:11.955]  Let me pause.
[00:42:11.955 --> 00:42:12.615]  There's so many lies.
[00:42:12.615 --> 00:42:15.796]  I probably should have started to stop this throughout the clip.
[00:42:15.796 --> 00:42:20.977]  They admittedly got a whole bunch of hard drives and computers and the rest of it.
[00:42:20.977 --> 00:42:28.118]  That's why they didn't just drop a bunch of bombs on it, because they wanted to kill or capture the people and get the intelligence.
[00:42:28.118 --> 00:42:32.219]  This was the ISIS command base for much of the Middle East.
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.361]  And their headquarters.
[00:42:35.361 --> 00:42:36.081]  You understand?
[00:42:36.081 --> 00:42:49.668]  They wanted to get into the headquarters and get the data or they could have just dropped a bunch of 2,000 pound bombs on it or flown around with C-130s with, you know, howitzers hanging off the side and blown the place into molten slag.
[00:42:49.668 --> 00:42:51.989]  They wanted the intelligence.
[00:42:51.989 --> 00:42:54.130]  That's the point of going on the mission.
[00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:54.990]  And guess what?
[00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:59.412]  They were waiting for them because there were leakers inside.
[00:42:59.412 --> 00:43:02.354]  You know, the type of folks that tell the president, watch your mouth.
[00:43:04.718 --> 00:43:08.080]  That's how we've got this thing backwards.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.621]  They have a word for it, but backwards.
[00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:12.922]  That's a family way of saying it.
[00:43:12.922 --> 00:43:16.543]  That's the arrogance of all these people.
[00:43:16.543 --> 00:43:25.207]  McCullen and all of them and Brennan and just what a disgusting group of snot-nosed, cowardly, chicken-neck filth.
[00:43:25.207 --> 00:43:26.988]  Brennan was a communist in college.
[00:43:26.988 --> 00:43:28.489]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:43:36.482 --> 00:43:39.488]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:39.488 --> 00:43:41.332]  Let me now finish up with the club.
[00:43:41.332 --> 00:43:41.612]  Here it is.
[00:43:42.626 --> 00:43:44.067]  Yeah, of course.
[00:43:44.067 --> 00:43:46.529]  And that's why she's there.
[00:43:46.529 --> 00:43:50.553]  As a sort of a feud of the people who are criticizing him for this.
[00:43:50.553 --> 00:43:55.677]  And this poor woman, this widow, who has lost her husband, she is in desperate grief right now.
[00:43:55.677 --> 00:43:56.878]  She's in love with her husband still.
[00:43:56.878 --> 00:43:57.878]  And in love with her husband.
[00:43:57.878 --> 00:43:58.959]  And what did you think of that?
[00:43:58.959 --> 00:44:01.441]  And to use that as just put another notch on his belt.
[00:44:01.441 --> 00:44:02.542]  And what's he thinking about?
[00:44:02.542 --> 00:44:03.403]  My ratings.
[00:44:03.403 --> 00:44:04.484]  And how many?
[00:44:04.484 --> 00:44:05.685]  Record applause!
[00:44:05.685 --> 00:44:08.147]  I'm going to get an Emmy for this.
[00:44:08.147 --> 00:44:11.810]  Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch.
[00:44:13.456 --> 00:44:20.520]  No, it's an award better than a Silver Star or Congressional Medal of Honor.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:33.687]  It's being honored by the people and her sacrifice and his sacrifice, because she's got to live now probably 50 years without the man she's so in love with.
[00:44:33.687 --> 00:44:37.069]  And let me tell you, those are particular loves that really only get stronger with time.
[00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:40.231]  A 20-something, 30-something year old woman, you know, three kids,
[00:44:41.476 --> 00:44:43.217]  And then her husband gets killed.
[00:44:43.217 --> 00:44:45.818]  That's gonna comfort her for the rest of her life.
[00:44:45.818 --> 00:44:48.459]  See, comforting her, that's not allowed.
[00:44:48.459 --> 00:44:49.219]  That's evil.
[00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:54.842]  That's how sick Michael Moore truly is.
[00:44:59.249 --> 00:45:00.571]  In fact, look at this.
[00:45:00.571 --> 00:45:06.819]  I have the photo right here for TV viewers.
[00:45:06.819 --> 00:45:13.127]  In fact, we have the video also we're going to play coming up of Nancy Pelosi.
[00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:15.591]  We have that on the video list.
[00:45:15.591 --> 00:45:16.412]  Staying seated.
[00:45:19.022 --> 00:45:25.288]  Yeah, she doesn't clap whenever they're talking about the economy as well and how he's going to try to get jobs.
[00:45:25.288 --> 00:45:33.015]  And she sits there looking absolutely, completely sullen and disgusting and just angry the whole time.
[00:45:33.015 --> 00:45:33.996]  The video's on Infowars.com.
[00:45:33.996 --> 00:45:36.358]  I'm not talking about a particular clip.
[00:45:36.358 --> 00:45:38.520]  Just the whole time she's sitting there looking like she's dying.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.481]  I was here last night.
[00:45:39.481 --> 00:45:40.201]  We were here last night.
[00:45:40.201 --> 00:45:41.162]  We covered it live.
[00:45:41.162 --> 00:45:44.605]  The archive of that is up on our YouTube channel and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:45:46.837 --> 00:45:52.621]  Bitter Democrats remain seated during tribute to Slane Seal.
[00:45:52.621 --> 00:45:53.761]  Yeah, there she is.
[00:45:53.761 --> 00:45:58.244]  She looks like a female Skeletor.
[00:45:58.244 --> 00:45:59.725]  Disconnected from reality.
[00:45:59.725 --> 00:46:03.747]  Made hundreds of millions of dollars, her husband billions, since she got into Congress.
[00:46:03.747 --> 00:46:06.049]  She had nothing when she got there.
[00:46:06.049 --> 00:46:10.752]  And she is just completely and totally, absolutely entitled.
[00:46:10.752 --> 00:46:13.854]  Now, particularly look at this photo though for TV viewers.
[00:46:13.854 --> 00:46:15.735]  You've got the Democrats seated here.
[00:46:17.639 --> 00:46:34.230]  During the tribute to the fallen Navy SEAL, you've got one guy that's smart enough to stand up, whoever that is, and then one other guy back here, but 90% of them, we got a Democrat here, here, here, you see one, two, three, four, five, six.
[00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:41.675]  So we got six Democrats standing up out of hundreds, disgusting, arrogant, crazy people.
[00:46:41.675 --> 00:46:44.097]  No one would ever do that in the past.
[00:46:45.299 --> 00:46:51.684]  When Obama was giving tributes to the military, no one ever did things like that.
[00:46:51.684 --> 00:46:55.446]  Again, that's how disconnected they are.
[00:46:55.446 --> 00:47:03.532]  Hillary campaigner calls military widow honored during Trump's speech an idiot.
[00:47:03.532 --> 00:47:12.078]  Sorry, Owen's wife, you're not helping yourself or your husband's memory by standing there and clapping like an idiot.
[00:47:12.078 --> 00:47:13.099]  Trump just used you.
[00:47:18.319 --> 00:47:22.201]  These people are totally and completely disconnected.
[00:47:22.201 --> 00:47:22.642]  Here's another one.
[00:47:22.642 --> 00:47:27.145]  Democrats boo Trump proposal to give a voice to victims of immigrant crime.
[00:47:27.145 --> 00:47:30.247]  We're going to get to that coming up after the break.
[00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:31.267]  Again, video.
[00:47:31.267 --> 00:47:34.169]  Pelosi refuses to applaud American job creation.
[00:47:34.169 --> 00:47:39.072]  We're going to play that when we come back.
[00:47:39.072 --> 00:47:39.633]  Now look at this one.
[00:47:39.633 --> 00:47:41.534]  I'm going to play this as well when we come back first.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:47.061]  Democrats think Trump's job is to represent the world, not America.
[00:47:47.061 --> 00:47:48.762]  They refused to stand.
[00:47:48.762 --> 00:47:49.702]  They refused to clap.
[00:47:49.702 --> 00:47:57.364]  But worse, they went and complained particularly about this to C-SPAN and to other TV channels and networks right after it.
[00:47:57.364 --> 00:47:59.445]  We played clips at the start of the broadcast.
[00:47:59.445 --> 00:48:01.365]  I mean, it's like a dirty word now.
[00:48:01.365 --> 00:48:05.526]  We should say, they plan to get rid of our sovereignty and transfer power to multinational groups.
[00:48:05.526 --> 00:48:06.487]  That's a conspiracy.
[00:48:06.487 --> 00:48:07.247]  That'll never happen.
[00:48:07.247 --> 00:48:08.447]  Here's all their admissions.
[00:48:08.447 --> 00:48:11.348]  Now they're doing it, and Trump wants to reverse it.
[00:48:12.168 --> 00:48:14.050]  Like, gee, our legs cut off.
[00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:15.992]  We better tie a tourniquet around it.
[00:48:15.992 --> 00:48:17.173]  That's insane.
[00:48:17.173 --> 00:48:19.195]  Let the blood flow out on the ground.
[00:48:19.195 --> 00:48:21.797]  That's how you become happy.
[00:48:21.797 --> 00:48:24.740]  Here, let's stick our hands in this meat grinder.
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.623]  Here, let's climb in a wood chipper and turn it on.
[00:48:27.623 --> 00:48:29.264]  Trump's like, let's not climb in the wood chipper.
[00:48:29.264 --> 00:48:35.090]  They're like, yes, we must destroy the country's sovereignty and transfer all power to secret offshore groups or we're evil.
[00:48:37.056 --> 00:48:38.257]  Can you believe Trump?
[00:48:38.257 --> 00:48:39.538]  He said we ought to have a country.
[00:48:39.538 --> 00:48:41.780]  I mean, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:44.903]  If someone's a felon, like a rapist, he's gonna deport them?
[00:48:44.903 --> 00:48:47.866]  He's gonna make you come here legally like everybody else does?
[00:48:47.866 --> 00:48:49.607]  I mean, it's crazy!
[00:48:49.607 --> 00:48:53.070]  He doesn't want you to come here and have your baby free at the hospital either.
[00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:54.272]  I mean, wow, man.
[00:48:54.272 --> 00:48:55.393]  What will he do next?
[00:48:55.393 --> 00:48:55.913]  I don't know.
[00:48:55.913 --> 00:48:56.794]  He's really bad, though.
[00:49:01.581 --> 00:49:03.342]  So that's all coming up after the break.
[00:49:03.342 --> 00:49:07.463]  First off, we are ending the special today, and it is gone.
[00:49:07.463 --> 00:49:12.945]  Massive specials across the board at InfoWarsTour.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:49:12.945 --> 00:49:22.329]  The Make America Great Again specials have been running for a week and a half, helped fund us after Google through AdRoll banned us from advertising on the internet, basically.
[00:49:22.329 --> 00:49:23.189]  On any Google platform.
[00:49:24.322 --> 00:49:28.523]  And you've really come through and we've made back a lot of the losses to help fund this operation and the D.C.
[00:49:28.523 --> 00:49:35.544]  offices that I have the lease right here in my hand to sign that I've been holding off on to make sure we get the money for that bureau.
[00:49:35.544 --> 00:49:37.325]  But it looks like we've got it, so thank you.
[00:49:37.325 --> 00:49:38.945]  Take advantage of these great sales.
[00:49:38.945 --> 00:49:44.006]  We had massive sales last night of X2 because Millie Weaver talked about how much it helped her.
[00:49:44.006 --> 00:49:44.846]  Leanne talked about it.
[00:49:44.846 --> 00:49:45.547]  Other people did.
[00:49:45.547 --> 00:49:46.447]  Owen Schroyer.
[00:49:46.447 --> 00:49:47.587]  I said, what product do you like the best?
[00:49:47.587 --> 00:49:49.227]  And they all gave their own testimonials.
[00:49:49.227 --> 00:49:51.648]  I'd never heard, but similar to what other people say.
[00:49:52.791 --> 00:49:59.099]  I know I asked Anthony to print me off some of the testimonials every day and then I never read them, but I'm going to get him to print me off some later so I can read them to you.
[00:49:59.099 --> 00:50:01.822]  Go read the five-star reviews at m4store.com.
[00:50:01.822 --> 00:50:03.124]  We link through to third-party sites.
[00:50:03.124 --> 00:50:04.806]  We can read them by the thousands.
[00:50:04.806 --> 00:50:07.689]  X2 is 25% off the good halogen.
[00:50:07.689 --> 00:50:09.231]  Nobody else has this pure iodine.
[00:50:09.231 --> 00:50:10.173]  25% off Brain Force.
[00:50:11.454 --> 00:50:13.615]  Donald J. Trump and Ronald Reagan lithographs.
[00:50:13.615 --> 00:50:19.159]  Again, these are original prints, new ink colors, new design on different parchment paper.
[00:50:19.159 --> 00:50:25.422]  But when these are gone, that's it for this design into eternity.
[00:50:25.422 --> 00:50:27.804]  1995, parchment in the roll, delivered to your door.
[00:50:28.724 --> 00:50:29.524]  In the tube.
[00:50:29.524 --> 00:50:30.725]  Makes a great gift as well.
[00:50:30.725 --> 00:50:31.945]  Great for framing.
[00:50:31.945 --> 00:50:34.506]  Trump Pants 2020 Battle Cry T-shirt.
[00:50:34.506 --> 00:50:34.986]  $9.95.
[00:50:34.986 --> 00:50:37.847]  We're selling these close to cost.
[00:50:37.847 --> 00:50:41.788]  It says Trump Pants 2020.
[00:50:41.788 --> 00:50:43.348]  Keeping America Great.
[00:50:43.348 --> 00:50:44.889]  Infowars.com on the right shoulder.
[00:50:44.889 --> 00:50:45.329]  On the back,
[00:50:46.329 --> 00:50:47.891]  America First in 1776.
[00:50:47.891 --> 00:50:49.312]  Infowars.com.
[00:50:49.312 --> 00:50:51.295]  Great way to meet like-minded people.
[00:50:51.295 --> 00:50:52.416]  Great way to spread the word.
[00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:54.218]  Great way to stand up for free speech.
[00:50:54.218 --> 00:50:55.640]  This is going to be the new hit chart.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.340]  It already is.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:57.221]  A lot of folks are getting it.
[00:50:57.221 --> 00:50:58.763]  So thank you all for your support.
[00:50:58.763 --> 00:50:59.183]  We'll be back.
[00:51:00.663 --> 00:51:02.244]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[00:51:02.244 --> 00:51:05.506]  I am a former congressman, physician, and presidential candidate.
[00:51:05.506 --> 00:51:07.047]  The world is in turmoil.
[00:51:07.047 --> 00:51:11.570]  Things like Ebola, earthquakes, wars, and famines are commonplace.
[00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:14.692]  As Americans, we are largely sheltered from these events.
[00:51:14.692 --> 00:51:18.355]  However, in parts of the world, just having enough food is a huge problem.
[00:51:18.655 --> 00:51:23.078]  For some of us, there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good.
[00:51:23.078 --> 00:51:25.960]  So we keep some food on hand just in case.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.663]  My family and I have found a product that helps us do this better.
[00:51:29.663 --> 00:51:32.184]  It's a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[00:51:32.184 --> 00:51:35.787]  With it, we eat healthier and store a little more food.
[00:51:35.787 --> 00:51:40.951]  We freeze dry everything we love to eat, and it lasts up to 25 years.
[00:51:40.951 --> 00:51:43.012]  Who knows what the future will bring?
[00:51:43.012 --> 00:51:47.055]  One thing's certain, my family and I will always have food on the table.
[00:51:47.375 --> 00:51:51.977]  To learn more, go to HarvestRight.com or call 800-763-5999.

[00:52:45.086 --> 00:52:48.207]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[00:52:48.207 --> 00:52:50.688]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[00:54:15.607 --> 00:54:23.702]  Let me go back to this t-shirt for a moment because...
[00:54:29.116 --> 00:54:30.656]  It really shook up the globalists.
[00:54:30.656 --> 00:54:40.579]  It had a huge effect, especially at rallies, both Republican and Democrat, to see a third of the people wearing Infowars.com shirts, Hillary for President shirts, you name it.
[00:54:40.579 --> 00:54:44.520]  And that's why we sold most of those shirts at either $9.95 or $5.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:54.803]  Now at $5, we lose money because some of the extra, extra larges cost more than that, but I really wanted to flood the country with the shirts.
[00:54:54.803 --> 00:54:57.564]  I believe this new shirt will flood the country even more.
[00:54:58.513 --> 00:54:59.893]  You've seen the power.
[00:54:59.893 --> 00:55:03.274]  You've seen what it did.
[00:55:03.274 --> 00:55:04.494]  Trump.
[00:55:04.494 --> 00:55:05.835]  Pence.
[00:55:05.835 --> 00:55:07.475]  2020.
[00:55:07.475 --> 00:55:08.856]  Trump is over-delivering.
[00:55:08.856 --> 00:55:10.276]  He's doing everything he said he would do.
[00:55:10.276 --> 00:55:12.036]  He's got the globalists totally scared.
[00:55:12.036 --> 00:55:13.657]  World government's in trouble.
[00:55:13.657 --> 00:55:16.617]  He's trying to stop the economy imploding.
[00:55:16.617 --> 00:55:21.299]  But the reason I'm so behind Trump is, we're neck and neck here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:21.299 --> 00:55:23.579]  We're not out of the woods by a long shot.
[00:55:23.579 --> 00:55:24.219]  They're desperate.
[00:55:24.219 --> 00:55:25.280]  They can try to kill him.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.440]  They're trying to implode the economy.
[00:55:28.749 --> 00:55:30.270]  But Trump loves a fight.
[00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:31.350]  He's a total fighter.
[00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:32.050]  It's just a fact.
[00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:33.031]  I mean, look what he's done.
[00:55:33.031 --> 00:55:34.992]  He looked 10 years younger last night.
[00:55:34.992 --> 00:55:36.132]  It's just crazy.
[00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:38.073]  The guy's 70 years old.
[00:55:38.073 --> 00:55:40.554]  The oldest president ever elected.
[00:55:40.554 --> 00:55:44.756]  It just gets weirder and cooler by the minute.
[00:55:44.756 --> 00:55:48.137]  See, worshipping Kim Jong-un is a joke, because the guy's a joke.
[00:55:48.137 --> 00:55:49.958]  Thinking Trump's amazing and an example.
[00:55:51.175 --> 00:55:54.476]  Just how he gets better with age is the truth.
[00:55:54.476 --> 00:55:55.796]  So everybody needs to get the shirt.
[00:55:55.796 --> 00:55:56.036]  It's $9.95.
[00:55:56.036 --> 00:55:59.937]  That way we make like four bucks to help fund the operation on each shirt.
[00:55:59.937 --> 00:56:01.258]  We're selling a lot of these.
[00:56:01.258 --> 00:56:04.118]  So we just upped the order to make even more.
[00:56:04.118 --> 00:56:06.879]  If you pre-order it, it'll be in next week and shipped out to you.
[00:56:06.879 --> 00:56:08.219]  It'll be printed right here in America.
[00:56:08.219 --> 00:56:10.000]  Then we will, again,
[00:56:11.343 --> 00:56:12.024]  I don't know.
[00:56:29.258 --> 00:56:34.303]  But they do that at rallies and things, or at universities where they know the cops have been ordered to stand down.
[00:56:34.303 --> 00:56:39.147]  In public, in most areas, it just shows solidarity and lets other people know it's safe to speak out.
[00:56:39.147 --> 00:56:44.071]  And that's something else Trump's done, battling political correctness, saying things everybody knows is true.
[00:56:44.071 --> 00:56:47.154]  It makes it safe and okay for other people to say it.
[00:56:47.154 --> 00:56:53.560]  Because everything they do is to try to make normal things we cover and normal things we talk about sound dirty and evil.
[00:56:55.674 --> 00:56:56.514]  But it's not.
[00:56:56.514 --> 00:56:57.435]  Like Glenn Beck last week.
[00:56:57.435 --> 00:56:59.816]  I keep going back to this because it's an archetypal example.
[00:56:59.816 --> 00:57:02.458]  It's a case point.
[00:57:02.458 --> 00:57:04.579]  Of upside down behavior.
[00:57:04.579 --> 00:57:06.019]  Of inversion.
[00:57:06.019 --> 00:57:07.340]  He says it's horrible.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:11.042]  He wants nationalism for the economy and actual jobs and thinking about America first.
[00:57:11.042 --> 00:57:12.723]  This is very dangerous.
[00:57:12.723 --> 00:57:15.184]  That's like saying he wants oxygen for his children.
[00:57:15.184 --> 00:57:16.225]  He doesn't want them to suffocate.
[00:57:17.875 --> 00:57:23.237]  But they say it with a straight face like, don't say mother and father when you're at a public event or at the school.
[00:57:23.237 --> 00:57:24.798]  Someone may not have a mother or father.
[00:57:24.798 --> 00:57:26.559]  You having one is bad.
[00:57:26.559 --> 00:57:29.560]  Say she or he or they, you know, use the words.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:30.640]  We're not a cult.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.621]  Just don't say mother and father.
[00:57:31.621 --> 00:57:32.561]  We're not a cult.
[00:57:32.561 --> 00:57:33.662]  Here, take this vaccine.
[00:57:33.662 --> 00:57:34.902]  We want to make you take it here.
[00:57:34.902 --> 00:57:37.263]  Let us, let's have grown men in your girl's showers.
[00:57:37.263 --> 00:57:38.504]  It's normal.
[00:57:38.504 --> 00:57:41.705]  If they don't want to see a men's penis, then there's something wrong with them.
[00:57:41.705 --> 00:57:42.846]  That's Cuomo on CNN.
[00:57:43.919 --> 00:57:45.742]  They're cult members, folks.
[00:57:45.742 --> 00:57:47.165]  They know what they're doing.
[00:57:47.165 --> 00:57:48.828]  They're using peer pressure on you.
[00:57:48.828 --> 00:57:50.070]  And Trump's smashing all that.
[00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:56.401]  Let's go out to break with this clip where, again, they're critical of the fact that Trump is talking about America first.
[00:57:56.401 --> 00:57:56.701]  Here it is.
[00:57:59.898 --> 00:58:13.968]  We expect our partners, whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.
[00:58:13.968 --> 00:58:15.749]  Have to do that.
[00:58:15.749 --> 00:58:20.412]  We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect...
[00:58:22.108 --> 00:58:33.493]  The foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.
[00:58:33.493 --> 00:58:35.334]  And again, all over the media, I've got the articles.
[00:58:35.334 --> 00:58:36.674]  They said it's horrible.
[00:58:36.674 --> 00:58:38.015]  They'll be back.
[00:58:38.015 --> 00:58:38.455]  Stay with us.
[00:58:38.455 --> 00:58:40.996]  Just take an hour straight ahead.

[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:55.581]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:03.675 --> 01:00:05.519]  We are on the march.
[01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:08.685]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:00:08.685 --> 01:00:12.372]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:38.745]  Let's back up that clip I was just playing of the President last night in his first address to Congress.
[01:00:38.745 --> 01:00:40.106]  And I've got a stack of news articles.
[01:00:40.106 --> 01:00:54.495]  We played video clips the last hour where they have Democrats going on TV saying they couldn't stand the fact that he was talking about America and having our own sovereignty and having our own borders and doing trade deals that are more equitable.
[01:00:54.495 --> 01:00:55.775]  I mean, that is unthinkable.
[01:00:55.775 --> 01:00:59.458]  America's here to be sold off by the parasite class.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:05.867]  Nancy Pelosi, who again thinks George W. Bush is still the president.
[01:01:05.867 --> 01:01:09.932]  That's how entitled these people are.
[01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:12.055]  Well, it's just not going to continue on forever.
[01:01:12.055 --> 01:01:13.557]  Let's go back to that full clip.
[01:01:18.393 --> 01:01:27.537]  Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.
[01:01:27.537 --> 01:01:28.417]  That's right, free nations!
[01:01:28.417 --> 01:01:31.299]  My job is not to represent the world.
[01:01:31.299 --> 01:01:34.600]  My job is to represent the United States of America.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.021]  You know what, hit pause.
[01:01:37.021 --> 01:01:46.105]  This is so simple, but so true, and so fundamental, and so powerful, that they, all over the news, New York Times today, you name it, say this is bad.
[01:01:47.605 --> 01:01:49.086]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[01:01:49.086 --> 01:01:53.851]  That's how upside down they think we are.
[01:01:53.851 --> 01:01:59.457]  That he's saying the best way for people to express themselves and be free is through free nations.
[01:01:59.457 --> 01:02:04.061]  Free, open, elected nations.
[01:02:04.061 --> 01:02:07.405]  That have culture and have systems that bind them together.
[01:02:09.977 --> 01:02:12.058]  That's the best way to express human freedom.
[01:02:12.058 --> 01:02:23.345]  Instead of some foreign, secret, TPP, UN world government, where they admit they want to make us poor, dumb us down, and have a global government with forced inoculations and forced medical tyranny.
[01:02:23.345 --> 01:02:31.850]  That's all been announced by the Clintons and by Bill and Melinda Gates and all their foundations ripping people off and robbing Haiti and all the rest of it.
[01:02:31.850 --> 01:02:37.694]  And here comes Trump just saying total common sense, like, drive on the right-hand side of the road.
[01:02:37.694 --> 01:02:38.955]  Put one foot in front of the other.
[01:02:40.046 --> 01:02:41.847]  Wash your hands before you eat!
[01:02:41.847 --> 01:02:46.111]  I mean, he's just saying total common sense, and they're going, this is horrible!
[01:02:46.111 --> 01:02:50.334]  Because what they're doing is so horrible, they have to, again, invert reality.
[01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:51.415]  Well, guess what?
[01:02:51.415 --> 01:02:54.157]  We're not living in upside-down land anymore, okay?
[01:02:54.157 --> 01:02:57.520]  Let's go back to the present.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.321]  Now, I want to play it again.
[01:02:58.321 --> 01:03:00.963]  I want to play the entire clip, because it's so powerful.
[01:03:01.823 --> 01:03:15.872]  We expect our partners, whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.
[01:03:15.872 --> 01:03:17.694]  Have to do that.
[01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:31.403]  We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also.
[01:03:38.595 --> 01:03:48.628]  Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path.
[01:03:48.628 --> 01:03:51.552]  My job is not to represent the world.
[01:03:51.552 --> 01:03:54.977]  My job is to represent the United States of America.
[01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:19.980]  Alright, we're going to come back with Trump's nominee for the ambassadorship for the European Union.
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:26.129]  That is probably the second most important ambassadorship, some could argue, with the big crack-up of the EU taking place.
[01:04:28.095 --> 01:04:29.957]  The most important ambassadorship.
[01:04:29.957 --> 01:04:32.879]  And he's definitely got the credentials in the background to do it.
[01:04:32.879 --> 01:04:34.160]  But an unprecedented move.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:35.461]  They don't want him.
[01:04:35.461 --> 01:04:37.683]  They're saying they may veto it.
[01:04:37.683 --> 01:04:41.386]  That's like kicking somebody's ambassador out before we have a war with them.
[01:04:41.386 --> 01:04:44.989]  Because right now the EU is totally run by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.
[01:04:44.989 --> 01:04:47.471]  And they are looting it seven ways from Sunday.
[01:04:47.471 --> 01:04:49.973]  The vampires are having their will right now.
[01:04:49.973 --> 01:04:54.937]  The last thing they want is some whippersnapper in there that might want to have those people be free.
[01:04:54.937 --> 01:04:57.479]  We'll be back as the global revolution against tyranny accelerates.
[01:05:01.736 --> 01:05:06.198]  Just when you thought the progressive left couldn't sink any lower.
[01:05:06.198 --> 01:05:15.403]  Last night's Trump speech to Congress gave liberals yet another opportunity to showcase their ignorance and lack of respect for the country.
[01:05:15.403 --> 01:05:25.289]  Right after President Trump finished his historic address to Congress, the usual suspects, like Michael Moore, appeared on television to bash Donald Trump.
[01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:29.191]  This time for honoring, wait for it, veterans.
[01:05:29.491 --> 01:05:31.313]  I'm gonna get an Emmy for this.
[01:05:31.313 --> 01:05:35.336]  Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch.
[01:05:35.336 --> 01:05:38.078]  I mean, this is the sickness of this man.
[01:05:38.078 --> 01:05:53.671]  Meanwhile, other liberals, like Hillary Clinton volunteer Dan Grillo, posted vulgar remarks on Twitter, calling the widow honored during Trump's speech an idiot, proving once again that liberalism is truly a mental disorder.
[01:05:53.671 --> 01:05:56.914]  I'm Darren McBrain, and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:00.785 --> 01:06:02.366]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:06:02.366 --> 01:06:08.269]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:06:08.269 --> 01:06:10.811]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:06:10.811 --> 01:06:16.634]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:06:16.634 --> 01:06:22.337]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:06:22.757 --> 01:06:25.718]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:25.718 --> 01:06:31.280]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:38.302]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[01:06:38.302 --> 01:06:42.863]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.

[01:08:12.074 --> 01:08:13.494]  You found it.
[01:08:13.494 --> 01:08:16.295]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[01:08:16.295 --> 01:08:18.396]  It's the Infowar.
[01:08:18.396 --> 01:08:20.617]  And now, Alex Jones.
[01:08:20.617 --> 01:08:24.958]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[01:08:24.958 --> 01:08:29.299]  Say the joker to the thief.
[01:08:29.299 --> 01:08:33.680]  There's too much confusion.
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.701]  I can't get no relief.
[01:08:36.673 --> 01:08:38.114]  Alright, welcome back.
[01:08:38.114 --> 01:08:42.175]  We're now into the second hour.
[01:08:42.175 --> 01:08:49.118]  Coming up, we're going to play more of the historic
[01:08:53.653 --> 01:08:55.874]  Address of Congress last night with President Trump.
[01:08:55.874 --> 01:09:02.838]  The mainstream media is just totally freaked out that he said that we will actually have America first and will negotiate deals that are best for the country.
[01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:04.099]  They just say this is horrible.
[01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:06.340]  We're going to play clips of that.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:09.142]  This is becoming really bizarre.
[01:09:09.142 --> 01:09:11.063]  But again, they're trying to make just normal.
[01:09:12.102 --> 01:09:21.969]  Business, normal common sense seem weird because handing all our sovereignty over to multinational unelected institutions is what's actually crazy.
[01:09:21.969 --> 01:09:28.373]  Now to the bottom of the hour, I can't go over his whole bio, it would take 30 minutes, Ted Malik of tedmalik.com joins us.
[01:09:28.373 --> 01:09:37.420]  I can't go over his whole pedigree of the major institutions he's run or where he's a professor, all the things that he's been involved in.
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.020]  He's also
[01:09:39.261 --> 01:09:48.768]  He's been a high-ranking official on the UN Economic Commission for Europe and President of the CNN World Economic Development Congress, you know, Davos, the whole nine yards.
[01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:50.710]  And I appreciate him coming on.
[01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:55.213]  I mean, here are the headlines out of the Washington Post, Breitbart, New York Post.
[01:09:55.213 --> 01:09:57.975]  Why Europe Fears This Great U.S.
[01:09:57.975 --> 01:09:59.876]  Ambassador is the headline.
[01:09:59.876 --> 01:10:02.839]  So they're battling, here's another headline, European Parliament Battles
[01:10:04.048 --> 01:10:06.589]  Nomination of Ted Malik as U.S.
[01:10:06.589 --> 01:10:07.289]  Ambassador.
[01:10:07.289 --> 01:10:12.391]  So they're saying don't nominate him, Trump, even though that's who they've said they want to nominate.
[01:10:12.391 --> 01:10:17.612]  Because if you do that, we're going to veto it, which again is unprecedented.
[01:10:17.612 --> 01:10:22.394]  And of course, I've seen Ted Malik all over TV for years.
[01:10:22.394 --> 01:10:24.494]  I mean, he comes off as very diplomatic.
[01:10:24.494 --> 01:10:27.315]  I mean, sounds like a perfect choice.
[01:10:27.315 --> 01:10:30.656]  If you went over his whole bio here, he's already been accepted into all these groups.
[01:10:30.656 --> 01:10:32.477]  They know who he is.
[01:10:33.891 --> 01:10:45.261]  It says, suave and distinguished, he's a professor at the respected British Business School, former Oxford visiting fellow, Yale professor, he's written 14 books, he's a high-ranking official at the UN Economic Commission, and it just goes on and on.
[01:10:45.261 --> 01:10:46.722]  I can't read the whole bio.
[01:10:46.722 --> 01:10:48.904]  So, why does Trump want him?
[01:10:48.904 --> 01:10:50.085]  Why are they trying to block him?
[01:10:50.085 --> 01:10:57.471]  I think talking to the man himself we can find out, his long-time friend, Dr. Jerome Corsi, who's also joining us via Skype, can pop in.
[01:10:57.471 --> 01:10:59.553]  So, Ted, thanks for coming on.
[01:10:59.553 --> 01:11:00.294]  What's going on here?
[01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:02.330]  Alex, thanks for having me.
[01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:04.151]  It's a pleasure to be on your show.
[01:11:04.151 --> 01:11:11.856]  I last saw you at the inauguration when we were celebrating President Trump's arrival on the Washington scene.
[01:11:11.856 --> 01:11:20.642]  And last night, of course, as you've just shown in your clip, he said he's going to be President of the United States and not President of the world.
[01:11:20.642 --> 01:11:30.829]  The reason that I've, I think, raised such a controversy in Europe is certainly not because of my educational pedigree or my dialogical skills.
[01:11:31.449 --> 01:11:54.447]  It's because I represent the worldview and the thinking of Donald Trump in Europe, and they actually hate and detest everything he is, stands for, and has said because he's turning the whole world over and he's changing their globalist outlook and forcing the world back into a state-centric system.
[01:11:56.671 --> 01:11:59.813]  Now, I know that that's something you've talked about and promoted quite a lot.
[01:11:59.813 --> 01:12:09.899]  I mean, let's get into your particular view of where the world currently is and where this battle to get you into that position is going.
[01:12:09.899 --> 01:12:12.621]  Well, I have not yet been nominated by the President.
[01:12:12.621 --> 01:12:22.286]  I have interviewed with the transition team and I was told I was favorably disposed to be put forward in such positions.
[01:12:22.286 --> 01:12:23.107]  Charlie, it's leaked.
[01:12:23.886 --> 01:12:29.188]  I've been on television talking about the EU and about Trump.
[01:12:29.188 --> 01:12:31.189]  You know, I was involved in the campaign.
[01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:33.810]  I wrote a book about Trump's path to victory.
[01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:38.892]  So I've been all over, both the British press and the European press.
[01:12:38.892 --> 01:12:48.656]  And that's frankly because very few people in Europe expected Trump to win, had any knowledge of what he was thinking, what kinds of policies he might enact.
[01:12:49.571 --> 01:12:58.866]  They frankly didn't have anybody else to turn to, so there are only a handful of us, frankly, in Europe that have any sensibility about what Trump represents.
[01:12:58.866 --> 01:13:04.174]  So I have had, I would say, even overexposure in the last eight weeks.
[01:13:04.915 --> 01:13:05.235]  Absolutely.
[01:13:05.235 --> 01:13:08.276]  I've seen you all over TV and I don't even watch that much mainstream television.
[01:13:08.276 --> 01:13:11.817]  Well, looking at this, when you look at the New York Post, it's obviously pretty close to Trump.
[01:13:11.817 --> 01:13:13.118]  They act like you are the nominee.
[01:13:13.118 --> 01:13:18.680]  I understand you're not officially, but the way the EU sees it is they're like, hey, you're nominating him, you better not do it.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.840]  We'll veto that.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.101]  Can you explain how they have the, quote, power to do that?
[01:13:22.101 --> 01:13:30.704]  I mean, if you become who Trump wants to represent us and then that happens, then why wouldn't that be something that they would accept?
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:38.343]  Well, what the European Union and, frankly, other countries around the world want is not so much a U.S.
[01:13:38.343 --> 01:13:41.664]  ambassador to them who represents the U.S.
[01:13:41.664 --> 01:13:45.085]  point of view, or in this case, the view of the Trump administration.
[01:13:45.085 --> 01:13:49.847]  What they really want is someone who will represent their view back to the United States.
[01:13:49.847 --> 01:13:55.930]  In other words, one that becomes captive or nativist and that takes their point of view.
[01:13:55.930 --> 01:13:59.211]  What they fear is that the Trump position
[01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:21.162]  And his view, which has been fairly clear in terms of Brexit and in terms of multilateralism and certainly supra-national organizations, is not something that would be welcome in Brussels, where the European Union is headquartered, because they fear that the Union itself is coming apart.
[01:14:22.046 --> 01:14:40.181]  Uh, with the vote of the United Kingdom to leave that European Union, and with a number of elections coming up in any number of other European countries, and potentially a referenda on whether the country should either stay in the Eurozone and keep the Euro as their currency, or even leave the European Union,
[01:14:40.839 --> 01:14:49.945]  They fear that their union is, frankly, in a position of, if not collapse, of derailment.
[01:14:49.945 --> 01:14:50.406]  That's right.
[01:14:50.406 --> 01:14:55.529]  Even the French news agency yesterday called it a soft civil war.
[01:14:55.529 --> 01:14:57.350]  You've got Poland trying to pull out.
[01:14:57.350 --> 01:15:02.314]  Le Pen basically says she'll pull out of the EU or discipline it and actually make it serve national interest.
[01:15:02.314 --> 01:15:04.816]  You've got Gert Wilders in the lead in the Netherlands.
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:12.627]  You've got Italy, as you know, a month or so ago saying, we're not going to vote to have EU expansion, we're not going to accept an EU army marching in.
[01:15:12.627 --> 01:15:17.431]  The arrogance of the EU, this unelected body, saying, oh, you want to pull out countries?
[01:15:17.431 --> 01:15:20.854]  We're just going to dissolve your militaries and put them under our control.
[01:15:20.854 --> 01:15:27.280]  I mean, this, the arrogant, open conquest of this, and I know you're a leading expert on this, how would you
[01:15:28.542 --> 01:15:42.330]  Break down, because you are a historian on these subjects, the place we are in the world where suddenly nationalism and self-determination is the avant-garde, it's exploding like wildfire, and it's having success.
[01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:53.536]  And now with Trump mega success, you see obviously what happened with Brexit, and then the system just becomes more arrogant and tells us we should live austerely, while they live like kings.
[01:15:53.536 --> 01:15:54.817]  I mean, it's like Marie Antoinette.
[01:15:55.037 --> 01:15:58.299]  I know she didn't really say this, but, you know, let the meat take.
[01:15:58.299 --> 01:15:59.720]  And then that became Bastille Day.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:05.945]  It just seems almost like, you know, those that the gods would destroy, they would first make mad.
[01:16:05.945 --> 01:16:09.427]  So since you've been all over Europe, you know all these people, you're in the middle of it.
[01:16:09.427 --> 01:16:10.508]  What's really going on?
[01:16:11.946 --> 01:16:16.228]  Well, I summed it up in an op-ed the other day when I said Davos man is dead.
[01:16:16.228 --> 01:16:23.252]  Now, whether he's literally dead or just dying, I think is a question of medical terminology.
[01:16:23.252 --> 01:16:33.457]  But this view that the global elites can run our countries, can run our lives, can run our cultures, most of them unelected, undemocratic,
[01:16:34.036 --> 01:16:47.061]  Socialists in orientation, progressive in terms of ideology, some of them far to the left, not just socialists, but even further to the left, is frankly coming to a screeching halt.
[01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:53.283]  And that's happening in large part because the pendulum is now swinging in the opposite direction.
[01:16:53.283 --> 01:16:59.005]  The election of Donald Trump has signaled that with a megaphone.
[01:16:59.005 --> 01:17:02.266]  Of course, Brexit before it, Nigel Farage and
[01:17:02.728 --> 01:17:27.262]  The whole movement to leave Europe was not supposed to be victorious, and it has actually now, I think, changed the course of modern European, maybe even global history, because that pendulum, like the pencil that's falling off the table, has reached its tipping point, and a number of countries around the world are likely to follow suit.
[01:17:28.134 --> 01:17:45.029]  You know, maybe we can pull that clip up briefly of when Brexit passed and the next day Nigel Farage, leading the torch in Europe obviously, I know you know him as well, says, you know, you laughed at me 15 years ago when I was first in this body, you're not laughing now, but they still laugh, and then Pelosi
[01:17:45.729 --> 01:17:48.171]  Won't even stand up, you know, for the veterans.
[01:17:48.171 --> 01:17:50.813]  The Democrats sat down.
[01:17:50.813 --> 01:17:55.456]  They boo and get upset when Trump talks about America first.
[01:17:55.456 --> 01:17:58.438]  I mean, the disconnect of these people.
[01:17:58.438 --> 01:18:02.941]  In the same press conference, Pelosi thinks Bush is still president eight plus years later.
[01:18:02.941 --> 01:18:08.605]  And then Maxine Waters gets up and says, well, Trump's helping Putin, who invaded Korea.
[01:18:09.065 --> 01:18:11.466]  They don't even say North or South Korea in their mistake.
[01:18:11.466 --> 01:18:12.926]  It's just la la land.
[01:18:12.926 --> 01:18:13.946]  I've been around these people.
[01:18:13.946 --> 01:18:15.346]  I've talked to some of them.
[01:18:15.346 --> 01:18:22.508]  They really are so insulated that I guess I was wrong back when I thought it was more centralized and conspiratorial.
[01:18:22.508 --> 01:18:27.089]  It's more like just a bunch of corrupt people got in control.
[01:18:27.089 --> 01:18:37.371]  Special interests just come in and it's almost worse than a conspiracy because it's like we just have no defense mechanism against these inept horrible people that have sold us out for pennies on the dollar.
[01:18:38.567 --> 01:18:59.697]  Well, you're talking about the Democratic Party in the United States, and it was quite observable last night when half the room was giving the President a deserved standing ovation for some, I think, very, very sincere words, both about the American military and about our military heroes, and also about some of the policies he wants to enact.
[01:18:59.697 --> 01:19:02.879]  And the other half of the room either sat it in their hands or hissed him.
[01:19:03.819 --> 01:19:06.101]  So it's a very polarized situation.
[01:19:06.101 --> 01:19:20.733]  That situation is actually 10 times worse in Europe, where the political spectrum is certainly left of the United States and where Donald Trump is held in the highest degree of contempt.
[01:19:20.733 --> 01:19:26.878]  I think it would interest you, Alex, I was on CNN before the election and Becky Anderson's show.
[01:19:26.878 --> 01:19:28.560]  I do go on all these shows.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.081]  I keep getting invited and go back.
[01:19:30.723 --> 01:19:43.992]  Maybe to torture them as much as myself, but she asked me seriously, the question that she asked me was, don't you think the whole world should get to vote for the United States president?
[01:19:43.992 --> 01:19:46.374]  Wow.
[01:19:46.374 --> 01:19:46.954]  I missed that.
[01:19:46.954 --> 01:19:47.855]  Well, let's find that clip.
[01:19:47.855 --> 01:19:48.675]  What was the name of the clip?
[01:19:48.675 --> 01:19:49.436]  You remember on YouTube?
[01:19:50.293 --> 01:19:53.794]  Well, it's Becky Anderson's show, State of the World, or whatever it's called.
[01:19:53.794 --> 01:19:54.615]  Yeah, guys, Google it.
[01:19:54.615 --> 01:19:55.775]  State of the World.
[01:19:55.775 --> 01:19:57.876]  Everyone in the world should be able to vote for president.
[01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:58.716]  I'm going to find that.
[01:19:58.716 --> 01:19:59.376]  That is incredible.
[01:19:59.376 --> 01:19:59.877]  Glenn Beck.
[01:19:59.877 --> 01:20:10.321]  I don't want to sit here and bash Glenn Beck, sir, but Glenn Beck was on CNN last week and he said, quote, it's scary that Trump and Bannon want nationalism and economic nationalism.
[01:20:10.321 --> 01:20:13.002]  I mean, that is, so again, there it is.
[01:20:13.002 --> 01:20:13.762]  I mean, what are they doing?
[01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:19.698]  Well, I mean, Glenn, I think he has been off his rocker for some time, but...
[01:20:21.759 --> 01:20:27.321]  Steve Bannon is the genius behind this intellectually.
[01:20:27.321 --> 01:20:28.621]  He is the strategist.
[01:20:28.621 --> 01:20:34.343]  He talked about his three buckets that he's trying to work out of during CPAC the other day.
[01:20:34.343 --> 01:20:37.764]  That was very telltale, very constructive.
[01:20:37.764 --> 01:20:49.647]  And certainly Donald Trump has taken that course and he argues very forcefully, frankly, as Theodore Roosevelt did and other people did at the turn of the 20th century.
[01:20:50.646 --> 01:20:54.250]  For America's national economic health.
[01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:57.414]  We need to rebuild our country.
[01:20:57.414 --> 01:20:58.435]  We're talking about renewal.
[01:20:59.645 --> 01:21:03.087]  We are talking about renewal of the American spirit.
[01:21:03.087 --> 01:21:10.810]  And actually, you know, I am a spiritual person, a Christian, and I noticed that Trump mentioned God at least a half a dozen times, it seems like.
[01:21:10.810 --> 01:21:12.110]  They hate that.
[01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:16.392]  So the origin, even, of some of this impetus is clear in his thinking.
[01:21:16.392 --> 01:21:26.036]  And I tell you, people on the right, people in evangelical circles, strong Catholics, appreciate what the President is saying.
[01:21:26.036 --> 01:21:26.877]  Well, we definitely...
[01:21:28.015 --> 01:21:28.335]  I think so.
[01:21:49.793 --> 01:21:53.014]  Ted, the website's tedmalik.com.
[01:21:53.014 --> 01:22:12.140]  What else can we do, as I bring Dr. Corsi in here briefly, what else can we do to help ensure, and you've also written a lot of books as well, to make sure that this new nationalism, what I call 1776 worldwide, the American example worldwide, not physical force, but the American spirit of renaissance reborn for renewal of the whole planet.
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:17.462]  This is what we need, not a, you know, UN global corporate elite dictatorship coming in.
[01:22:17.802 --> 01:22:21.163]  You know, dictating the terms of human surrender to the technocracy.
[01:22:21.163 --> 01:22:30.905]  What can we do to have Trump fully nominate you and then try to somehow finesse you into the position and have the EU accept it?
[01:22:30.905 --> 01:22:32.345]  Well, there are two things.
[01:22:32.345 --> 01:22:44.168]  Obviously, in the first hand, we have to remind Donald Trump that I've had this conversation and that I'm the best candidate, I think, to represent that point of view in Europe because of qualifications.
[01:22:44.875 --> 01:22:52.764]  And frankly, because I've spent all this time in Europe and understand and can constructively talk with them.
[01:22:52.764 --> 01:22:55.527]  I'm not there to be their archenemy.
[01:22:55.527 --> 01:22:58.270]  I just have to bring them our point of view.
[01:22:58.270 --> 01:23:05.818]  And secondly, I think if the European Union wants to make me persona non grata, which is what they say, it would be a badge of honor.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:15.006]  To make me PNG in Brussels and actually say we won't accept an ambassador from the United States who has Trump's point of view.
[01:23:15.006 --> 01:23:17.889]  I think we should then do two things.
[01:23:17.889 --> 01:23:22.952]  Send them no ambassador and deal with them only on a bilateral basis.
[01:23:22.952 --> 01:23:23.693]  Yes.
[01:23:23.693 --> 01:23:28.697]  And secondly, remove their ambassador from Washington DC.
[01:23:28.697 --> 01:23:32.780]  Because if they're not going to accept our ambassador, that's usually what you do right before a war happens.
[01:23:33.882 --> 01:23:34.202]  Correct.
[01:23:34.202 --> 01:23:36.485]  I mean, it's just unprecedented, the arrogance.
[01:23:36.485 --> 01:23:38.388]  Well, you look at arrogance in history.
[01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:49.421]  Hitler, as you know, just a week before he finally got, you know, killed or committed suicide there under the Chancellery in Berlin, still thought he was going to beat the Russians and the Allies.
[01:23:50.322 --> 01:23:52.964]  Was totally delusional, and his people still believed him.
[01:23:52.964 --> 01:23:56.166]  Now I think we're far from that, but we're getting close.
[01:23:56.166 --> 01:24:02.990]  Where nationalism's exploding, it's so popular, and this globalism is unelected, so disconnected, so corrupt.
[01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:11.576]  I mean, they're never going to be able to have this private corporate world government, with the whole socialist bent to it, when there's opposition to it.
[01:24:12.276 --> 01:24:13.956]  They're losing ground everywhere.
[01:24:13.956 --> 01:24:17.537]  They back the very worst actors like, you know, radical Islam.
[01:24:17.537 --> 01:24:21.978]  They're just horrible people who are so disconnected that they don't get it.
[01:24:21.978 --> 01:24:26.039]  So, I mean, I think we need to explain to them you're going to lose.
[01:24:26.039 --> 01:24:36.641]  You need to get with the program and believe in humanity again instead of having this eugenics view of, you know, cut off the resources and slave the people while they themselves live like kings.
[01:24:36.641 --> 01:24:37.201]  Let's bring in
[01:24:38.101 --> 01:24:45.549]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, who I know is a big booster of Trump trying to ram you through, which I think is a good move.
[01:24:45.549 --> 01:24:48.252]  Play the Trump card on him.
[01:24:48.252 --> 01:24:50.134]  I think this is a great idea, Dr. Corsi.
[01:24:50.134 --> 01:24:54.439]  Again, the New York Post and folks act like he's already the ambassador.
[01:24:54.439 --> 01:24:55.280]  How do we get this through?
[01:24:56.277 --> 01:25:01.058]  Well, I've known Ted for a long time and he's a big best choice.
[01:25:01.058 --> 01:25:05.239]  I was with Ted and Nigel Farage during the inauguration.
[01:25:05.239 --> 01:25:10.460]  Ted has the very strong support of all the Brexit leaders.
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:16.542]  He will represent accurately and strongly President Trump's position to the EU.
[01:25:16.542 --> 01:25:18.682]  This is what frightens the EU.
[01:25:18.682 --> 01:25:20.103]  And it is really astounding.
[01:25:20.103 --> 01:25:25.824]  I mean, by the way, Ted is a Theodore Roosevelt, President Roosevelt descendant.
[01:25:26.542 --> 01:25:35.594]  He is a PhD, he's very strongly regarded both in academics, he's been on the international stage, but he's not a globalist.
[01:25:35.594 --> 01:25:38.578]  This is the remarkable thing about Ted Malek.
[01:25:38.578 --> 01:25:43.224]  He's been at Davos, he's actually run the Aspen Institute.
[01:25:43.984 --> 01:25:47.746]  He's run them both, but he's done it always with a perspective of the United States.
[01:25:47.746 --> 01:25:50.987]  And that's why they don't like him, just like Bannon from Goldman Sachs.
[01:25:50.987 --> 01:25:52.628]  He's been inside the systems.
[01:25:52.628 --> 01:25:54.109]  He knows how to work it.
[01:25:54.109 --> 01:25:56.670]  He's been at the highest levels, but he's going to represent us.
[01:25:56.670 --> 01:25:58.070]  That's why they're scared.
[01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.811]  That's right.
[01:25:58.811 --> 01:26:00.891]  He didn't drink their Kool-Aid.
[01:26:00.891 --> 01:26:08.955]  He went along with the, you know, the internationalism, but from a perspective... Just like Rex Tillerson did, to be able to stay where he was at, but quietly fighting it the whole time.
[01:26:09.608 --> 01:26:10.208]  Precisely.
[01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:16.431]  And this is really what the core of Donald Trump's strength is and the reason, key reason he was elected.
[01:26:16.431 --> 01:26:21.913]  The American people do not want to become part of some godless global system.
[01:26:21.913 --> 01:26:24.454]  Unelected officials in Brussels telling us what to do.
[01:26:24.454 --> 01:26:26.295]  We want the United States of America.
[01:26:26.295 --> 01:26:27.455]  We want the Constitution.
[01:26:27.455 --> 01:26:33.898]  We want, you know, the freedoms that we, our founding fathers gave us in a Judeo-Christian nation that was born
[01:26:34.618 --> 01:26:39.181]  With principles that have been astounding in terms of their ability to protect liberty.
[01:26:39.181 --> 01:26:48.026]  Sure, and people that are watching on TV all recognize Ted Malik, but I should have said Aspen Institute, one of the most elite international organizations.
[01:26:48.026 --> 01:26:49.827]  People say, well then why do you want him?
[01:26:49.827 --> 01:26:58.912]  Because over the years he's always fought to keep sovereignty and to promote free market systems, and now he'll be able to help dynamite these tentacles
[01:26:59.653 --> 01:27:02.980]  of control that are bringing us down and turn the whole world free.
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:06.827]  That's why we need him and I sure hope that Trump does this.
[01:27:07.571 --> 01:27:09.412]  Well, you're exactly right.
[01:27:09.412 --> 01:27:13.575]  I mean, see Alex, he ran Davos for over 10 years.
[01:27:13.575 --> 01:27:14.255]  I forgot that.
[01:27:14.255 --> 01:27:15.216]  Ran Davos.
[01:27:15.216 --> 01:27:16.897]  And he's saying Davos is dead.
[01:27:16.897 --> 01:27:18.759]  I mean, I should have intro'd this.
[01:27:18.759 --> 01:27:21.220]  I never hype things like I should.
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:32.208]  The man that ran Davos and the Aspen Institute is saying that the New World Order that they've set up is dead and that we need to have nations create a new global alliance to empower humanity.
[01:27:32.208 --> 01:27:34.249]  That is absolutely incredible.
[01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:35.590]  No wonder they don't want him in there.
[01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:52.139]  Well, I helped Ted get his memoirs published two years ago, because it's a remarkable story of, you know, someone who's been on the globalist stage at the highest level, running it, running Davos, running the Aspen Institute in the United Nations in Geneva.
[01:27:52.139 --> 01:28:01.023]  I mean, Ted has pedigree credentials of the New World Order, but Ted has constantly said that we need to preserve American sovereignty.
[01:28:01.023 --> 01:28:02.384]  He was a supporter of Donald Trump.
[01:28:04.125 --> 01:28:09.807]  All you know is the globalists are against Trump, the globalists are against Ted Malik, because they understand that.
[01:28:09.807 --> 01:28:11.567]  They fear the understanding he has.
[01:28:11.567 --> 01:28:12.548]  So I should have intro'd this.
[01:28:12.548 --> 01:28:13.848]  Let me do it again now.
[01:28:13.848 --> 01:28:27.333]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got Ted Malik, the man that ran Davos, the public Bilderberg group for 10 years, that ran the Aspen Institute, the guy that knows where all the bodies are buried, that has the keys to the kingdom, who's quietly been trying to stop the system forever.
[01:28:27.333 --> 01:28:31.574]  Donald Trump wants to send him to be the EU ambassador, and they're trying to blow that up right now.
[01:28:31.874 --> 01:28:32.754]  This is incredible.
[01:28:32.754 --> 01:28:40.158]  Well, Ted, in closing, how do we make sure, again, the listeners, that you're the man that Trump forces through?
[01:28:40.158 --> 01:28:47.122]  Well, there's a little bit of exaggeration, or hyperbole, in my good friend Jerry's presentation of my biography.
[01:28:47.122 --> 01:28:48.603]  I never really ran Davos.
[01:28:48.603 --> 01:28:52.405]  I was only on the executive board for, I think, four or five years.
[01:28:52.405 --> 01:28:55.066]  Oh, so you were only on the executive board of Davos.
[01:28:55.066 --> 01:28:56.167]  You're a nobody.
[01:29:00.568 --> 01:29:04.690]  I have at least some degree of humility, like Vice President Pence.
[01:29:04.690 --> 01:29:06.231]  Yeah, we need humility, you're right.
[01:29:06.231 --> 01:29:07.071]  He's strongest.
[01:29:07.071 --> 01:29:10.632]  But I'm just excited that you get in there to be able to help bring down the EU.
[01:29:10.632 --> 01:29:12.553]  I'm sorry.
[01:29:12.553 --> 01:29:25.558]  If people in the United States could support my being involved, whether it's in this role or another role, I think that I could help the Trump effort, particularly on the international front.
[01:29:26.698 --> 01:29:27.279]  Absolutely.
[01:29:27.279 --> 01:29:29.020]  Well, Mr. Malik, thank you so much.
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:31.562]  People can find out more about your books at tedmalik.com.
[01:29:31.562 --> 01:29:33.624]  MSM is going to attack him being on the show.
[01:29:33.624 --> 01:29:34.265]  That's good.
[01:29:34.265 --> 01:29:36.267]  We don't want to be with the system.
[01:29:36.267 --> 01:29:43.533]  We are the folks trying to remove the globalist elite, and we need somebody like Mr. Malik who knows how to burn this thing down and restore the republic.
[01:29:43.533 --> 01:29:44.454]  All right.
[01:29:44.454 --> 01:29:46.055]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:46.055 --> 01:29:46.756]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:46.756 --> 01:29:47.937]  This is the InfoWar.
[01:29:47.937 --> 01:29:48.838]  Thank you, Dr. Corsi, as well.
[01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:53.759]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.759 --> 01:29:56.445]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.838 --> 01:30:06.281]  Just when you thought the progressive left couldn't sink any lower.
[01:30:06.281 --> 01:30:15.506]  Last night's Trump speech to Congress gave liberals yet another opportunity to showcase their ignorance and lack of respect for the country.
[01:30:15.506 --> 01:30:25.392]  Right after President Trump finished his historic address to Congress, the usual suspects, like Michael Moore, appeared on television to bash Donald Trump.
[01:30:25.392 --> 01:30:29.274]  This time for honoring, wait for it, veterans.
[01:30:29.694 --> 01:30:31.414]  I'm gonna get an Emmy for this.
[01:30:31.414 --> 01:30:35.535]  Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch.
[01:30:35.535 --> 01:30:38.176]  I mean, this is the sickness of this man.
[01:30:38.176 --> 01:30:53.739]  Meanwhile, other liberals like Hillary Clinton volunteer Dan Grillo posted vulgar remarks on Twitter calling the widow honored during Trump's speech an idiot, proving once again that liberalism is truly a mental disorder.

[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:39.826]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[01:33:00.613 --> 01:33:03.694]  So we have Eden right there.
[01:33:03.694 --> 01:33:04.314]  This is me.
[01:33:20.593 --> 01:33:24.135]  There is a war.
[01:33:24.135 --> 01:33:25.796]  There is a war.
[01:33:25.796 --> 01:33:27.617]  It's happening now.
[01:33:27.617 --> 01:33:30.078]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:33:30.078 --> 01:33:32.640]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.561]  We are the resistance.
[01:33:34.561 --> 01:33:37.303]  We are the Infowar.
[01:33:37.303 --> 01:33:39.944]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:39.944 --> 01:33:42.626]  Now that's a promo we've been running for about four years.
[01:33:44.437 --> 01:33:46.218]  And I intended to take the government back.
[01:33:46.218 --> 01:33:48.659]  I intended to promote national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:33:48.659 --> 01:33:50.461]  I intended to promote prosperity.
[01:33:50.461 --> 01:34:02.327]  I intended to promote renaissance because renaissance was Europe coming out of the Middle Ages, the Dark Ages, with centralized groups that had books and machines and hot air balloons and everything else.
[01:34:02.327 --> 01:34:04.789]  They just didn't want the public to have it.
[01:34:04.789 --> 01:34:10.472]  So if you tried to be an apothecary and have some herbs to treat illness, they'd kill you and say you were a witch.
[01:34:10.472 --> 01:34:11.753]  All knowledge was under attack.
[01:34:13.854 --> 01:34:18.996]  You had the false revolution in France that was the left-hand path, Jacobin Satanism.
[01:34:18.996 --> 01:34:21.476]  That's mainline history books.
[01:34:21.476 --> 01:34:22.997]  That's the leftist today.
[01:34:22.997 --> 01:34:25.998]  And I've had historians on, Lord Monckton, he concurs, you name it.
[01:34:25.998 --> 01:34:34.521]  I talk about all the witches and devil worshippers nationally in Rolling Stone and CNN calling for Trump's death last Friday and Saturday in mass rituals.
[01:34:34.521 --> 01:34:35.081]  And what did they do?
[01:34:36.988 --> 01:34:42.015]  They have articles out and right wing watch, you name it, saying I'm crazy, imagining that we're fighting a cultist.
[01:34:42.015 --> 01:34:43.678]  I'm not the weirdo that believes in all that.
[01:34:43.678 --> 01:34:44.559]  They do.
[01:34:44.559 --> 01:34:49.145]  But our revolution, our 1776, was the Renaissance, the real one.
[01:34:49.145 --> 01:34:50.067]  There's always a counterfeit.
[01:34:52.259 --> 01:34:58.961]  So, we're looking at the reality of things, and they can't say, oh, there's no world government, oh, there's no occult, or there's no this, there's no that.
[01:34:58.961 --> 01:35:08.865]  Now, I knew who Ted Malik was, but guests sneak up on me, and of course, he, you know, has known Trump for 40 years, been involved in the State Department, and done all sorts of, you know, things as a consultant, and banking, you name it.
[01:35:08.865 --> 01:35:16.508]  So, he's got a bigger pedigree, not just in journalism, three-time number one New York Times bestseller, guy that changed, admittedly, at least one election's outcome.
[01:35:16.508 --> 01:35:19.249]  You know, he's credited with that.
[01:35:19.249 --> 01:35:19.829]  Probably three.
[01:35:20.834 --> 01:35:23.236]  But the point is, he knows a lot of people.
[01:35:23.236 --> 01:35:29.821]  And so, at the inauguration, I saw him walking by, I said, hi, Tim, he's with Farage, and of course, Ted Malik, and I'm like, I recognize that guy, and I'm like, oh yeah.
[01:35:29.821 --> 01:35:36.627]  And of course, they were already billing him in the news as the ambassador, because that's who Trump wants, but the EU's saying, don't do it.
[01:35:36.627 --> 01:35:48.217]  But then I started remembering, when I was reading his bio, I was like, head of the Aspen Institute, and I was like, and I remember reading in Mainstream News' bio, you know, the head of Davos, you know, on the executive board, that's heading up Davos,
[01:35:49.244 --> 01:35:55.006]  And I was like, whoa, now this is, this guy's, but then I did some more looking right before I went on air.
[01:35:55.006 --> 01:36:01.608]  And he was the nationalist view in there, wanting people, countries to work together, but not transfer all the power, critic of TPP.
[01:36:01.608 --> 01:36:04.829]  So I would say he's an internationalist.
[01:36:04.829 --> 01:36:06.270]  That's how they sold a lot of young people.
[01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:13.032]  Back when my dad was a young person, on top of his classes, they called you in, we're going to create an international order, and the US is going to run it, and we're going to empower the planet.
[01:36:13.032 --> 01:36:15.193]  It was 1776 worldwide.
[01:36:15.193 --> 01:36:17.254]  But then you learn later, that's not really what it is.
[01:36:19.045 --> 01:36:27.248]  Once you get the higher-level Harvard PhDs, like Henry Kissinger got, or Francis Boyle got, and Boyle's one of the highest levels, and he's exposed the whole thing, because he was there.
[01:36:27.248 --> 01:36:31.350]  They were intending him to do all this, but he was a sleeper cell, just like Trump was.
[01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:33.071]  Trump knew this stuff before I was born.
[01:36:33.071 --> 01:36:43.655]  Of course, he said, I mean, he learned from Roy Cohn, 10 years, his lawyer, who was in all the secret papers, how our government funded communism, the Bolsheviks, all of it, and he was trying to stop that.
[01:36:43.655 --> 01:36:46.877]  So, there's always been a resistance before I was born to this,
[01:36:47.711 --> 01:36:50.331]  The question is, why does the EU not want Ted Malik?
[01:36:50.331 --> 01:36:56.292]  Because they know, I was telling Corsi during the break, I said, is this his rehabilitation?
[01:36:56.292 --> 01:36:57.833]  You know, coming on the Alex Jones Show?
[01:36:57.833 --> 01:37:00.773]  And he said, well, he's been rehabilitated for a while.
[01:37:00.773 --> 01:37:03.574]  So, it's not that I'm endorsing a globalist.
[01:37:03.574 --> 01:37:05.974]  I'm explaining, we better get ready to win.
[01:37:05.974 --> 01:37:08.835]  We better get ready for mass defections over to our side.
[01:37:08.835 --> 01:37:11.595]  We better get ready to actually restore all this.
[01:37:11.595 --> 01:37:15.656]  I keep saying, I wasn't up here saying this all these years just to, you know, scare people.
[01:37:15.656 --> 01:37:16.156]  It was real.
[01:37:16.796 --> 01:37:25.243]  We got involved, you took action, everywhere nationalism surging, optimism surging, the globalist model of making us poor and dependent is in trouble.
[01:37:25.243 --> 01:37:31.668]  What we're fighting is a very ugly, stinking, failed, criminal, authoritarian,
[01:37:32.791 --> 01:37:33.952]  Criminal ideology.
[01:37:33.952 --> 01:37:36.012]  It's easy to beat.
[01:37:36.012 --> 01:37:38.714]  If you have confidence, call their bluff and move forward.
[01:37:38.714 --> 01:37:40.514]  And we're playing the Trump card.
[01:37:40.514 --> 01:37:43.676]  So, I'm going to give Corsi about 5-10 minutes to have the floor.
[01:37:43.676 --> 01:37:49.438]  Not so much about Malik, him some too, but just getting ready to win.
[01:37:49.438 --> 01:37:51.079]  Getting ready to overturn the globalists.
[01:37:51.954 --> 01:37:57.161]  You understand, they always try to brand us as, oh look, Jones is upset, Jones is angry sometimes.
[01:37:57.161 --> 01:37:58.062]  Look, he's a loser.
[01:37:58.062 --> 01:38:03.589]  They played clips on Fox News last night of going, look, he says he's setting brush fires in the minds of men and women.
[01:38:03.589 --> 01:38:09.697]  In fact, all he's talking, trying to find this on Media Matters, where they have it on the five, they have the Democrat that's on there, whatever his name is.
[01:38:10.518 --> 01:38:23.850]  Democratic strategist, and I forget his name, and they're playing it like it's funny, and like I'm stupid, saying, we're awake, we're taking action, we're human, we're finding our will again, we're getting up off the couch, we're killing our apathy.
[01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:28.094]  They're like, oh, that's funny, because they want to keep you on the couch, folks.
[01:38:28.094 --> 01:38:31.297]  And even Fox News, all these backhanded attacks on Trump.
[01:38:31.297 --> 01:38:32.698]  It's about controlling conservatives.
[01:38:34.190 --> 01:38:34.792]  Opposition.
[01:38:34.792 --> 01:38:36.696]  That's what Murdoch's always wanted.
[01:38:36.696 --> 01:38:39.302]  And he tried this coup last year with Ailes.
[01:38:39.302 --> 01:38:40.405]  It still didn't work, did it?
[01:38:40.405 --> 01:38:42.108]  Everyone rejected Megyn Kelly.
[01:38:42.108 --> 01:38:43.331]  She destroyed herself.
[01:38:43.331 --> 01:38:44.233]  She self-immolated.
[01:38:45.646 --> 01:38:49.348]  So they've got a very, very delicate balancing act to do.
[01:38:49.348 --> 01:38:54.831]  But going back to Dr. Corsi, and Doc, I'm going to go ahead and sign the lease today.
[01:38:54.831 --> 01:38:58.292]  The folks came through the last week and a half buying the products and things.
[01:38:58.292 --> 01:39:04.075]  We made back about half the money that we lost with Google denying us to be able to advertise on the Google platform.
[01:39:04.075 --> 01:39:06.536]  Incredible discrimination, but I want to thank the listeners.
[01:39:06.536 --> 01:39:09.418]  So I have faith in the listeners that we'll make up the rest and be able to expand this year.
[01:39:10.098 --> 01:39:18.263]  In the face of it, plus it's our duty, we're going to do it, so I'll get that lease signed today or tomorrow, and then we can sign the deal to get some obvious probably rented furniture, computers, whatever you need.
[01:39:18.263 --> 01:39:24.426]  Let's just get it in there and start staffing it, because it's our duty to take these guys on, especially now that we're starting to win.
[01:39:24.426 --> 01:39:33.451]  But can you speak about Malik himself, and then you're the supranationalist, the guy that even more than Lou Dobbs, who deserves great credit and had top ratings on CNN, they fired him, and that's why they're in the tank.
[01:39:34.431 --> 01:39:46.775]  Who was the lone guy out there writing books, going on TV almost every week with Lou Dobbs, World Net Daily, coming on this show, saying globalism, TPP, NAFTA, GATT, Trans-Pacific Partnership, getting the secret documents with Judicial Watch.
[01:39:46.775 --> 01:39:47.776]  I'm not trying to build you up.
[01:39:47.776 --> 01:39:50.477]  I want folks to know how we beat them in the past.
[01:39:50.477 --> 01:39:51.677]  We were way behind then.
[01:39:51.677 --> 01:39:56.999]  So if you're endorsing this guy, I'm just going to go off your endorsement, even though I have actually
[01:39:57.839 --> 01:40:01.583]  Put him on TV before, talked about Davos and said, look at this scum.
[01:40:01.583 --> 01:40:03.424]  And just in general, I've said, look at this scum.
[01:40:03.424 --> 01:40:09.370]  I don't, I haven't seen bad stuff Malik's done, but I mean, I'm just, if you vouch for him, cause we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:11.152]  And I know Trump read your books.
[01:40:11.152 --> 01:40:13.314]  A lot of his views are also based on what you've done.
[01:40:13.314 --> 01:40:16.817]  So let's just say you've already culturally shaped this second American revolution.
[01:40:16.817 --> 01:40:22.622]  So if, you know, a guy that's like right up there with Patrick Henry or, or, you know, John Adams or somebody that's, I mean,
[01:40:23.303 --> 01:40:24.243]  Who was the beer brewer?
[01:40:24.243 --> 01:40:24.743]  Sam Adams.
[01:40:24.743 --> 01:40:26.084]  I'd compare you like a Sam Adams.
[01:40:26.084 --> 01:40:32.965]  You know, you're a business guy, successful, out there spending your money, your treasure, to get the word out as an American ideologue.
[01:40:32.965 --> 01:40:50.808]  Let's talk about Malik and let's talk about the phenomenon, if we've got to get out of the phenomenon of being losers, not that we were ever were, or the outside group, we have to get ready to go in, restore the republic, and then deliver to break the back of collectivism, to break the back, as I've said, as you've said, as Bannon said, of collectivism.
[01:40:52.065 --> 01:40:54.847]  Well, first of all, you're exactly right.
[01:40:54.847 --> 01:40:56.628]  We've been fighting this battle for a long time.
[01:40:56.628 --> 01:41:01.131]  Malik, I've known for years, Malik was never a globalist.
[01:41:01.131 --> 01:41:18.403]  He always, yes, he went to the UN, he had a position in Geneva, he worked with Davos at the highest levels, he ran the Aspen Institute, but he's an American, descended out of Theodore Roosevelt, PhD, taught at Yale, he's taught at Oxford,
[01:41:18.996 --> 01:41:21.218]  His credentials are impeccable.
[01:41:21.218 --> 01:41:24.820]  He's known at the highest levels of the business community internationally.
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:36.089]  He's very modest, but I've seen him run seminars with 200 of the biggest companies on a constant basis for years for some of the major accounting firms.
[01:41:36.089 --> 01:41:47.337]  Ted is internationally well-known, but the unique thing about Ted Malek, and this is why I endorse him, it's why I work with him so strongly, I've got his memoirs published.
[01:41:48.398 --> 01:41:53.480]  Is that he never believed the lies of the globalists.
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:57.601]  And he went to Davos, he went to Aspen thinking that he could fight it.
[01:41:57.601 --> 01:42:00.642]  Thinking that he could still preserve the fundamental values.
[01:42:00.642 --> 01:42:03.163]  Ted's always been a constitutionalist.
[01:42:03.163 --> 01:42:05.664]  He's always been very religious.
[01:42:05.664 --> 01:42:07.705]  Very determined Christian.
[01:42:07.705 --> 01:42:13.387]  And always determined to have the values of our Constitution and Founding Fathers be preserved.
[01:42:13.934 --> 01:42:20.377]  Now, it was a losing battle to think that we could transform the global organizations, and Ted realized this.
[01:42:20.377 --> 01:42:29.322]  The remarkable thing is that he's from the inside, Ted Malik, testifying to how morally depraved, how empty
[01:42:30.142 --> 01:42:44.891]  Completely at a loss how much of a failure the EU is, the United Nations, all the globalist dream, the International Monetary Fund, the idea that we're going to go to this transnational world government.
[01:42:44.891 --> 01:42:51.095]  Ted Malik has fought this for at least the last 20 years, maybe 30 years of his career.
[01:42:51.095 --> 01:42:54.837]  And I introduced Malik to Donald Trump.
[01:42:55.796 --> 01:42:59.840]  I also was working very strongly with Nigel Farage.
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.863]  I've worked with a whole group in the Brexit movement.
[01:43:02.863 --> 01:43:05.325]  We're reaching across to Europe.
[01:43:05.325 --> 01:43:13.191]  Where Ted Malik frightens so deeply the Europeans is because he is highly intelligent.
[01:43:13.191 --> 01:43:14.713]  He's got the credentials.
[01:43:14.713 --> 01:43:15.493]  He's been there.
[01:43:15.493 --> 01:43:17.015]  And from the inside,
[01:43:17.702 --> 01:43:28.106]  He knows how morally depraved, how completely vacuous, how cynical, and how dangerous these New World Order organizations are.
[01:43:28.106 --> 01:43:33.607]  So Ted has fought issues like against the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[01:43:33.607 --> 01:43:34.988]  His book is really worth reading.
[01:43:34.988 --> 01:43:44.051]  His book on Aspen Davos, his whole experience with the memoirs, I really strongly recommend.
[01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:46.592]  And, you know, spending time with Nigel Farage,
[01:43:47.492 --> 01:43:57.794]  And Ted, I can tell you that the Europeans who are with Trump view Ted Malik as one of their strongest allies.
[01:43:57.794 --> 01:44:01.975]  Ted published over 40 editorials supporting Trump.
[01:44:01.975 --> 01:44:04.576]  He's been on the BBC constantly.
[01:44:04.576 --> 01:44:06.316]  His life has been threatened.
[01:44:06.316 --> 01:44:10.537]  The EU has said that if Donald Trump dares to nominate Ted Malik,
[01:44:11.306 --> 01:44:11.506]  Yes.
[01:44:26.152 --> 01:44:30.116]  And I think Donald Trump will have the courage to look at this nomination.
[01:44:30.116 --> 01:44:34.541]  Steve Bannon has been very strongly supportive of Ted Malik.
[01:44:34.541 --> 01:44:37.224]  Ted has gone through all the different rungs.
[01:44:37.224 --> 01:44:40.928]  He's really strongly been interviewed.
[01:44:40.928 --> 01:44:43.951]  That's why the EU doesn't want him, and that tells you everything you need to know.
[01:44:44.051 --> 01:44:46.072]  In fact, so I revised what I said.
[01:44:46.072 --> 01:44:48.473]  It's not his rehabilitation even with the public.
[01:44:48.473 --> 01:44:59.499]  It's that he's been on the inside, and I know so many other people like, on the left, Joseph Stiklitz, who's won, you know, Nobel Prizes for Economics and another Nobel Prize.
[01:44:59.499 --> 01:45:05.262]  He left in 2002, a bunch of documents got leaked, and he said, I don't care if it's leftist or right-wingers inside the global system.
[01:45:05.862 --> 01:45:10.083]  Globalism was sold on the idea of helping the poor and building up civilization.
[01:45:10.083 --> 01:45:15.405]  Instead, it's a race to the bottom, ripping people off, consolidating countries and imploding them.
[01:45:15.405 --> 01:45:21.666]  And now the mega banks, they want to take over Europe and the US and implode them and suck them dry.
[01:45:21.666 --> 01:45:23.007]  I'm warning everyone.
[01:45:23.007 --> 01:45:24.467]  So that was a 2002 warning.
[01:45:24.467 --> 01:45:25.848]  He came on the show.
[01:45:25.848 --> 01:45:29.048]  And so now it's not just, you know, Stiklitz, it's people like Malik.
[01:45:29.048 --> 01:45:33.110]  There are good people that are on the inside who tried to fix it on the inside.
[01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:34.130]  In fact, that's what
[01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:45.820]  Francis Boyle, who has that top PhD, they only give one of a year, that secret PhD basically at Harvard, I know you're aware of that, and where they actually tell you how it all works and how to be a top technician.
[01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:47.321]  Only one of them a year.
[01:45:47.321 --> 01:45:51.345]  And he already actually knew about it and then didn't use it once he got it.
[01:45:51.345 --> 01:46:00.192]  So, you know, the point is there's not many of these people that actually have been given the globalist inside scoop who then actually oppose it.
[01:46:00.192 --> 01:46:01.674]  That's why they don't want him in there.
[01:46:02.455 --> 01:46:08.136]  Well, Alex, I may never mention this to you, but when I was at Harvard, I got my PhD at Harvard.
[01:46:08.136 --> 01:46:10.637]  Harvard paid my entire tuition.
[01:46:10.637 --> 01:46:11.997]  They paid me to go to Harvard.
[01:46:11.997 --> 01:46:17.198]  I was paid $1,000 a month to be at Harvard at that time.
[01:46:17.198 --> 01:46:21.279]  I never really... I was finished with all my requirements at the end of about a year.
[01:46:21.279 --> 01:46:23.599]  I had four years to be there.
[01:46:23.599 --> 01:46:29.981]  I was given full reign of whatever I wanted to do at Harvard or MIT, but I never paid a penny to go to Harvard.
[01:46:29.981 --> 01:46:32.061]  They invited me to come and paid the entire
[01:46:32.887 --> 01:46:33.508]  We're good to go.
[01:46:49.506 --> 01:46:54.490]  It is basically wanting to reduce the population of the United States.
[01:46:54.490 --> 01:46:55.511]  The world, actually.
[01:46:55.511 --> 01:46:57.013]  Reduce the population of the world.
[01:46:57.013 --> 01:47:03.899]  It's an elitist organization where the elite thinks that they can tell all the rest of the people on the face of the earth what to do.
[01:47:03.899 --> 01:47:06.441]  It has no respect for people of this elite.
[01:47:07.021 --> 01:47:11.287]  It's constantly wanting to create wars, control money.
[01:47:11.287 --> 01:47:12.889]  It's corrupt on the inside.
[01:47:12.889 --> 01:47:20.898]  Look at how they admit Bill and Melinda Gates won a world government headed up by Chelsea, but now they're saying they want it to be Oprah Winfrey to run in 2020.
[01:47:20.898 --> 01:47:23.842]  They believe she will defeat Trump and bring in what Hillary couldn't.
[01:47:24.471 --> 01:47:27.892]  Yeah, well come on Oprah, give it a try.
[01:47:27.892 --> 01:47:30.573]  She's never really sustained what it takes to be president.
[01:47:30.573 --> 01:47:33.553]  Donald Trump has been at this since the 1990s.
[01:47:33.553 --> 01:47:37.815]  Read Roger Stone's book, The Making of the President 2016.
[01:47:37.815 --> 01:47:39.855]  This was not a new idea from Donald Trump.
[01:47:39.855 --> 01:47:41.035]  Absolutely, and I've talked to Roger.
[01:47:41.035 --> 01:47:45.277]  He doesn't like to brag because then they use it and try to make Trump mad or whatever.
[01:47:45.277 --> 01:47:46.457]  It's a constant manipulation.
[01:47:46.457 --> 01:47:47.937]  Alex is Trump's brain.
[01:47:47.937 --> 01:47:49.018]  Roger is Trump's brain.
[01:47:50.978 --> 01:47:53.200]  Trump's weak-minded, it manipulates him.
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:57.524]  It just continually is shoved in there by the people that are working against us.
[01:47:57.524 --> 01:48:00.847]  And so Roger doesn't like to brag about it, but I know you guys go way back.
[01:48:00.847 --> 01:48:06.211]  And it's admitted, Ronald Reagan even wrote on a letter, he said, this guy's going to be president, there's something about him.
[01:48:06.211 --> 01:48:11.656]  And as you said, 40 years ago, and you wrote this 15 years ago, you said Donald Trump's going to be president.
[01:48:11.656 --> 01:48:15.179]  Yeah, I've thought it since I first met him.
[01:48:15.179 --> 01:48:17.121]  40 years ago, I thought Donald Trump would be president.
[01:48:17.857 --> 01:48:22.061]  Look, Donald Trump is a highly intelligent guy.
[01:48:22.061 --> 01:48:25.124]  He's very, very smart and he's a very effective leader.
[01:48:25.124 --> 01:48:28.968]  And he fundamentally agrees with us.
[01:48:28.968 --> 01:48:31.230]  And he has always fundamentally agreed with us.
[01:48:33.092 --> 01:48:41.458]  And nobody wants to say this, we're with the most hardcore right-wingers in New York that knew all the secrets that ran the Un-American Activities Committee.
[01:48:41.458 --> 01:48:57.008]  I mean, he literally, his lawyer, confidant, top advisor, mentor, Roy Cohn, who Hollywood demonizes, abs super hard-nosed, that's where Donald Trump got much of his worldview.
[01:48:57.008 --> 01:48:57.368]  That's right.
[01:48:57.368 --> 01:49:00.771]  You see, Donald Trump, he doesn't need anybody's coaching.
[01:49:00.771 --> 01:49:01.731]  He doesn't need anybody.
[01:49:01.731 --> 01:49:02.872]  He'll think for himself.
[01:49:03.607 --> 01:49:06.210]  But he's got around him some very good people.
[01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:08.913]  Ted Malik has been a major influence in Europe.
[01:49:08.913 --> 01:49:10.735]  Ted's taken a lot of flack for this.
[01:49:10.735 --> 01:49:12.617]  His life has been threatened.
[01:49:12.617 --> 01:49:14.019]  He's been demeaned.
[01:49:14.019 --> 01:49:15.360]  I could see it in his body language.
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:16.581]  He knows he's doing the right thing.
[01:49:16.581 --> 01:49:21.347]  And I could tell he's pretty, not freaked out, but you could tell he was like a guy walking in front of a firing squad.
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:30.444]  Well, and he'll continue to... Can you imagine a top globalist just walks on our show and says, I'm working against this, and as you said, behind the scenes?
[01:49:30.444 --> 01:49:33.186]  Because I know there's been a whole Americana agenda within globalism.
[01:49:33.186 --> 01:49:37.428]  In fact, some say it was even planned, but that gets a little too sophisticated.
[01:49:37.799 --> 01:49:42.264]  Well, you know, all these Bob Beckles who attacked you on Fox, I saw that.
[01:49:42.264 --> 01:49:43.405]  Bob Beckle is a hack.
[01:49:43.405 --> 01:49:44.287]  He's attacked me.
[01:49:44.287 --> 01:49:48.571]  I mean, you know, he's had an alcoholic past.
[01:49:48.571 --> 01:49:54.999]  It's hard to tell whether he's more objectionable or Juan Williams or even now a chef.
[01:49:55.479 --> 01:49:55.639]  It's
[01:50:12.290 --> 01:50:16.772]  But other than that, it's constant because I watch it when I exercise in the morning and at night when I go to bed.
[01:50:16.772 --> 01:50:22.154]  It's backhanded attacks constantly and like, oh, he said the media is the enemy.
[01:50:22.154 --> 01:50:23.074]  That's like a dictator.
[01:50:23.074 --> 01:50:24.975]  He said the fake news is the enemy.
[01:50:24.975 --> 01:50:28.256]  Again, even Fox News, Shep Smith is disgusting.
[01:50:28.256 --> 01:50:30.217]  It's disgusting.
[01:50:30.217 --> 01:50:35.739]  And they attack you, Alex, and InfoWars because you've been so effective.
[01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:45.429]  Because you've developed, across the country, an attachment to a large middle class that Richard Nixon used to call a silent majority.
[01:50:45.429 --> 01:50:48.331]  I mean, I saw it with Ronald Reagan.
[01:50:48.331 --> 01:50:53.997]  The elite in the United States, the elite around the world, the GOP establishment, all hated Ronald Reagan.
[01:50:53.997 --> 01:50:54.317]  That's right.
[01:50:54.317 --> 01:51:00.123]  Let's talk about, now that Trump's delivering, and really is in charge now, that speech last night, how the elite stride back.
[01:51:01.514 --> 01:51:03.235]  Hi there, Dick Holgenair here.
[01:51:03.235 --> 01:51:07.598]  I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[01:51:07.598 --> 01:51:11.081]  I normally never do commercial endorsements.
[01:51:11.081 --> 01:51:13.763]  I am very skeptical of health supplements.
[01:51:13.763 --> 01:51:17.866]  But a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One.
[01:51:17.866 --> 01:51:22.229]  So I purchased a bottle and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now.
[01:51:22.569 --> 01:51:25.590]  I very much dislike so-called energy boosters.
[01:51:25.590 --> 01:51:31.352]  Those little energy drinks that have caffeine and guarana and other things that make your heart race.
[01:51:31.352 --> 01:51:32.453]  This is not that.
[01:51:32.453 --> 01:51:35.714]  My experience with Synergy One has been great.
[01:51:35.714 --> 01:51:36.974]  My mood is better.
[01:51:36.974 --> 01:51:38.175]  My joints feel better.
[01:51:38.175 --> 01:51:42.917]  I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity.
[01:51:42.917 --> 01:51:46.518]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more.
[01:51:46.518 --> 01:51:48.519]  So I recommend Synergy One.
[01:51:48.519 --> 01:51:49.599]  It's really good stuff.
[01:51:49.599 --> 01:51:51.380]  I'm having great results with it.
[01:51:52.011 --> 01:51:57.192]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com.
[01:51:57.192 --> 01:52:00.233]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y, dot com.
[01:52:00.233 --> 01:52:03.174]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's.
[01:52:03.174 --> 01:52:08.235]  In an epic battle of David versus Goliath, in the early 1980s, a child was born.
[01:52:08.235 --> 01:52:09.175]  Two of them, actually.
[01:52:09.175 --> 01:52:11.235]  Their names were Jeff and Andy.
[01:52:11.235 --> 01:52:15.616]  Time went by, they developed facial hair, and one day, something happened.
[01:52:15.616 --> 01:52:17.737]  Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors.
[01:52:18.237 --> 01:52:22.201]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all.
[01:52:22.201 --> 01:52:31.168]  They hired the best designers, they bought a 95-year-old German blade factory, and they started selling high-quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers.
[01:52:31.168 --> 01:52:33.510]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:35.052]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[01:52:35.552 --> 01:52:36.352]  Don't worry.
[01:52:36.352 --> 01:52:41.914]  Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to give all guys a great shave at a great price.
[01:52:41.914 --> 01:52:43.315]  Try Harry's free.

[01:53:00.983 --> 01:53:02.784]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:53:02.784 --> 01:53:04.445]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[01:53:09.548 --> 01:53:14.071]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:53:29.500 --> 01:53:32.062]  We use cell phones against our heads every day.
[01:53:32.062 --> 01:53:33.463]  But now a landmark U.S.

[01:54:24.796 --> 01:54:35.061]  I wish that I could fly, into the sky, so very high, just like a dragonfly.
[01:54:35.061 --> 01:54:44.226]  I'd fly above the trees, over the seas, and on the greens, to anywhere.
[01:54:45.935 --> 01:54:51.559]  I was just talking to Zach, one of our researchers, and there he's the guy you see pulling up the articles almost as fast as I can say them.
[01:54:51.559 --> 01:55:01.947]  He's like, oh yeah, Ted Malik, he just read like 20 articles about the globalists in the last decade, threw him off everything, went after him, because he was openly criticizing them, and I guess in their private councils doing it.
[01:55:01.947 --> 01:55:04.769]  So I should have introduced the guy as a hero.
[01:55:04.769 --> 01:55:06.891]  The head of the Aspen Institute doesn't get more elite than that.
[01:55:06.891 --> 01:55:10.233]  That's like Davos US on the board of the Davos Group.
[01:55:10.233 --> 01:55:11.454]  That is so prestigious.
[01:55:11.454 --> 01:55:11.775]  And I remember
[01:55:13.127 --> 01:55:17.189]  Hearing him on the show and then seeing his face, and I'd already done research, I was like, wow!
[01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:22.372]  And Dr. Corsi's endorsing this guy, so now I really feel good about what Dr. Corsi's saying and doing.
[01:55:22.372 --> 01:55:25.373]  How could Trump not put this guy in as the ambassador?
[01:55:25.373 --> 01:55:28.534]  I want to talk about how the empire's going to strike back here, Dr. Corsi.
[01:55:28.534 --> 01:55:37.899]  But first, going back to you just briefly here, how about the phenomenon of the Liberty Movement thinking we're always supposed to be in the hills, waiting for the UN troops to come.
[01:55:37.899 --> 01:55:39.139]  I always said, no.
[01:55:39.139 --> 01:55:41.861]  Take over your city councils, run for office, our ideas.
[01:55:42.816 --> 01:55:44.217]  Or bulletproof.
[01:55:44.217 --> 01:55:49.760]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come to quote the French philosopher and statesman Victor Hugo.
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:51.060]  I mean, now is the time.
[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:52.541]  And so we're having victory.
[01:55:52.541 --> 01:55:56.623]  We're not offering some utopia like the communists or socialists or one-worlders.
[01:55:56.623 --> 01:56:05.248]  We're not even saying we shouldn't have global alliances, but it has to be deals based on sovereignty and based on equity and based on humanity and based on basic principles.
[01:56:05.748 --> 01:56:07.710]  Well, he wanted to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:56:07.710 --> 01:56:08.851]  We've talked about it for quite a long time.
[01:56:24.604 --> 01:56:44.898]  And this is the group that has elected Trump, and I've been writing about Malik for a long time, but this was the key today, because I think if our audience says to Donald Trump, this is an important ambassador position, and Ted Malik... And he's published books, I didn't even know this!
[01:56:44.898 --> 01:56:51.023]  Inside Davos, inside Globalism, inside Aspen, and inside Iran.
[01:56:51.023 --> 01:56:52.584]  Wow, no wonder they don't want him in there!
[01:56:53.308 --> 01:56:55.051]  Well, and it's, and this is the key.
[01:56:55.051 --> 01:56:57.837]  I mean, he has seen it from the inside.
[01:56:57.837 --> 01:57:01.925]  So, uh, Ted Malik- And let's just tell you, Trump wants to be like Theodore Roosevelt.
[01:57:01.925 --> 01:57:04.530]  This guy's named Theodore Roosevelt Malik.
[01:57:05.333 --> 01:57:19.636]  In fact, one of the first articles Ted wrote was how Donald Trump resembles Theodore Roosevelt, and how his brand of speaking to the people, going back to the fundamental values of America, was a Theodore Roosevelt approach that really worked.
[01:57:19.636 --> 01:57:24.357]  And Donald Trump, in many ways, has characteristics similar to Theodore Roosevelt.
[01:57:24.357 --> 01:57:25.677]  I know you've got to go, but we've got to go to break.
[01:57:25.677 --> 01:57:28.298]  Can you do five more minutes to talk about how you think the empire is going to strike back?
[01:57:28.831 --> 01:57:29.491]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:57:43.416 --> 01:58:07.071]  Please go get the t-shirts, Trump Pants 2020, Keeping America Great on the front, America First in 1776, Infowars.com on the back, to get in the face of the bullies, to spread the word, to meet like-minded patriots, and we are about to stop as soon as this shirt comes in next week, and pre-order it, get it at $9.95, it goes up to $19.95 when we get it in next week, pre-order now, you'll be the first to get it, Hillary for Prison 2017, George Soros, deport George Soros in the back,
[01:58:07.791 --> 01:58:10.312]  I'm going to stop selling these as well.
[01:58:10.312 --> 01:58:12.073]  So we're not making any more of those.
[01:58:12.073 --> 01:58:13.613]  This is the new shirt I want to focus on.
[01:58:13.613 --> 01:58:14.414]  Trump Pence 2020.
[01:58:14.414 --> 01:58:18.495]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:18.495 --> 01:58:20.076]  And today's the final day.
[01:58:20.076 --> 01:58:24.417]  The mega specials that we launched last week when they censored us, trying to raise capital back.
[01:58:24.417 --> 01:58:26.498]  I've got to stop because a lot of stuff is starting to sell out.
[01:58:26.498 --> 01:58:29.519]  Brain Force, Survival Shield, Super Male, Super Female.
[01:58:29.519 --> 01:58:30.740]  They're all amazing products.
[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:32.820]  Five-star reviews on third-party sites.
[01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:34.221]  Check them out for yourself.
[01:58:34.221 --> 01:58:36.502]  Caveman, Paleo, and so much more.
[01:58:37.382 --> 01:58:38.744]  It's all selling out as we speak.
[01:58:38.744 --> 01:58:39.846]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:39.846 --> 01:58:41.047]  Thank you for the support.
[01:58:41.047 --> 01:58:42.669]  You are the resistance.
[01:58:42.669 --> 01:58:45.113]  You're supporting yourself, and God bless you.
[01:58:45.113 --> 01:58:46.535]  And please, don't forget those prayers.
[01:58:46.535 --> 01:58:47.196]  We need them.
[01:58:47.196 --> 01:58:47.877]  I'm praying for you.
[01:58:50.507 --> 01:58:54.668]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[01:58:54.668 --> 01:58:57.449]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[01:58:57.449 --> 01:58:58.949]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[01:58:58.949 --> 01:59:03.210]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[01:59:03.210 --> 01:59:07.011]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[01:59:07.011 --> 01:59:08.612]  Well, you know what the next boom's gonna be, don't you?
[01:59:08.612 --> 01:59:10.252]  It's gonna be coming after your guns.
[01:59:10.252 --> 01:59:10.632]  Oh, yeah.
[01:59:10.632 --> 01:59:12.793]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[01:59:12.793 --> 01:59:13.413]  At all.
[01:59:13.413 --> 01:59:14.453]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[01:59:14.453 --> 01:59:16.854]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:59:16.854 --> 01:59:17.554]  They lost.
[01:59:18.114 --> 01:59:18.814]  We won.
[01:59:18.814 --> 01:59:21.015]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[01:59:21.015 --> 01:59:22.356]  It's time to ride, boys.
[01:59:22.356 --> 01:59:24.256]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[01:59:24.256 --> 01:59:30.338]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[01:59:30.338 --> 01:59:32.699]  And beef was for supper.
[01:59:32.699 --> 01:59:33.480]  Revelation.
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:35.280]  Dawn of global government.
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:37.121]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:59:37.121 --> 01:59:38.641]  DVDs now available.
[01:59:38.641 --> 01:59:42.943]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:59:43.343 --> 01:59:46.687]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:59:46.687 --> 01:59:49.029]  RevelationsTheMovie.info.
[01:59:49.029 --> 01:59:52.893]  Let's fix it.
[01:59:52.893 --> 01:59:55.535]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:21.807]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:21.807 --> 02:00:26.171]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:26.171 --> 02:00:30.354]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:00:30.354 --> 02:00:32.756]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.756 --> 02:00:35.919]  We've been rolling that liner for 10 years.
[02:00:35.919 --> 02:00:36.580]  Notice it happens.
[02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:39.098]  In fact, soon I'll have to stop playing the liners.
[02:00:39.098 --> 02:00:40.619]  It won't be.
[02:00:40.619 --> 02:00:48.323]  You know, in FEMA Region 6, because then FEMA will just be an emergency agency, not something to take over NAV10 regions, as COG admits it is.
[02:00:48.323 --> 02:00:51.365]  We have to be ready to win.
[02:00:51.365 --> 02:00:53.386]  We have to understand that the high command
[02:00:55.783 --> 02:00:56.944]  Is the golden rule.
[02:00:56.944 --> 02:00:58.225]  And it's exactly what Trump said.
[02:00:58.225 --> 02:00:59.906]  Laying down your life for others.
[02:00:59.906 --> 02:01:00.907]  Laying down your name.
[02:01:00.907 --> 02:01:01.507]  Being attacked.
[02:01:01.507 --> 02:01:02.148]  It doesn't matter.
[02:01:02.148 --> 02:01:03.569]  Because you know you're right.
[02:01:03.569 --> 02:01:04.650]  We're changing the world.
[02:01:04.650 --> 02:01:05.671]  You are the info war.
[02:01:05.671 --> 02:01:06.691]  I don't just say that.
[02:01:06.691 --> 02:01:08.012]  You are the info war.
[02:01:08.012 --> 02:01:10.054]  You're the reason this is happening.
[02:01:10.054 --> 02:01:13.317]  But so many people, and it's a meme that MSM is putting out.
[02:01:13.317 --> 02:01:14.297]  I'm a bootlicker.
[02:01:14.297 --> 02:01:15.878]  I'm with the establishment now.
[02:01:15.878 --> 02:01:16.279]  No.
[02:01:16.279 --> 02:01:18.480]  When I disagree with Trump, I'm going to disagree.
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:22.724]  And from the position of loyal opposition, it'll have a bigger effect.
[02:01:22.724 --> 02:01:24.165]  The point is, is that
[02:01:25.765 --> 02:01:29.346]  Trump listens to real counsel, but he doesn't listen to BS.
[02:01:29.346 --> 02:01:32.386]  He listens to people with a track record of telling the truth.
[02:01:32.386 --> 02:01:34.006]  And you have to understand, this is real.
[02:01:34.006 --> 02:01:37.207]  It's not going to be perfect, but think of what it would have been like with Hillary.
[02:01:37.207 --> 02:01:38.607]  Why are the elites so upset?
[02:01:38.607 --> 02:01:39.447]  Because Trump's the real deal.
[02:01:39.447 --> 02:01:41.268]  So let's not be too confident, though.
[02:01:41.268 --> 02:01:42.648]  We're in the fight of our lives.
[02:01:42.648 --> 02:01:43.968]  We're in like the sixth round.
[02:01:43.968 --> 02:01:44.768]  We've turned a corner.
[02:01:44.768 --> 02:01:46.008]  We're starting to win.
[02:01:46.008 --> 02:01:47.029]  But there's six more rounds.
[02:01:47.029 --> 02:01:50.549]  Dr. Corsi, in the three minutes we have left, how do you see the empire striking back?
[02:01:50.549 --> 02:01:52.870]  I see them trying to implode the economy and blame Trump.
[02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:53.770]  They admit they're doing that.
[02:01:53.770 --> 02:01:54.430]  What else do you see?
[02:01:55.066 --> 02:02:01.511]  Well yes, you're going to see very quickly the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, trying to implode the economy.
[02:02:01.511 --> 02:02:04.893]  They kept interest rates at zero to prop up Obama.
[02:02:04.893 --> 02:02:07.655]  Ten trillion dollars worth of debt.
[02:02:07.655 --> 02:02:13.859]  The fight is going to be in the precincts, in the school boards, in local communities.
[02:02:13.859 --> 02:02:15.300]  The Democrats are going to do everything they can.
[02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:19.003]  The far left, I just submitted an article with Perez.
[02:02:19.543 --> 02:02:29.530]  Tom Perez, head of the DNC, and Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected in Congress, a member of the Nation of Islam up until 2006.
[02:02:29.530 --> 02:02:32.071]  The Democrats have just taken a far turn left.
[02:02:32.071 --> 02:02:34.073]  The Democrats are going hard left.
[02:02:34.073 --> 02:02:36.394]  They're going full-in socialist.
[02:02:36.394 --> 02:02:40.637]  This is the communist takeover movement attempt of their lifetime.
[02:02:40.637 --> 02:02:42.338]  That's not rhetoric!
[02:02:42.338 --> 02:02:44.600]  It's flaming Bolshevik garbage!
[02:02:45.293 --> 02:02:50.077]  I mean, go take a look at the Communist Party of the United States of America.
[02:02:50.077 --> 02:02:55.421]  Its agenda and its website, its program is indistinguishable.
[02:02:55.421 --> 02:02:58.883]  By the way, listen, I don't just grovel to the police, but I'm for law and order.
[02:02:58.883 --> 02:03:01.345]  The communist groups are openly calling for cops to be killed.
[02:03:01.345 --> 02:03:03.287]  If I did that, I'd be arrested rightfully so.
[02:03:03.287 --> 02:03:04.788]  They're trying to organize crime.
[02:03:04.788 --> 02:03:07.530]  Why isn't the Attorney General already moving against them?
[02:03:07.530 --> 02:03:09.531]  I don't care if the left calls it fascism.
[02:03:09.531 --> 02:03:10.352]  They're the fascists.
[02:03:11.897 --> 02:03:24.941]  Jeff Sessions is going to move against it, but the whole Black Lives Matter, the whole attempt to intimidate police, the election's got to destroy police because it's fundamental to the law and order of a civil society.
[02:03:24.941 --> 02:03:26.181]  Why are they so arrogant?
[02:03:26.181 --> 02:03:28.882]  Don't they know that they've waken the sleeping giant?
[02:03:28.882 --> 02:03:29.862]  They got a tiger by the tail?
[02:03:30.492 --> 02:03:38.874]  Well, we've, you know, we've done everything we can for the last 20 years to help America, and I certainly have, you certainly have, and America's listened.
[02:03:38.874 --> 02:03:42.194]  I mean, it's taken very detailed investigative research.
[02:03:42.194 --> 02:03:43.915]  It's taken producing the truth.
[02:03:43.915 --> 02:03:49.236]  But Americans out there, by the millions, are wakening up, they're listening, they're paying attention.
[02:03:49.236 --> 02:03:55.497]  Doctor, how exciting is it for you to see the hard work you've done and Ron Paul's done, and how we were ridiculed, attacked, demonized?
[02:03:55.497 --> 02:03:59.558]  Isn't it satisfying, not in an arrogant way, but at a spiritual level, the victory we're having?
[02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:08.973]  I feel like, Alex, it was the right thing to do and I feel like, you know, I get so identified with what Donald Trump said last night.
[02:04:08.973 --> 02:04:16.476]  The military who died on the battlefield, they didn't ask for any riches or their names to be put up in the stars.
[02:04:16.476 --> 02:04:23.899]  I'll take a bow when all the Americans who have died for this country in battle have their chance to stand up and take a bow.
[02:04:23.899 --> 02:04:25.260]  Right after that, I'll take a bow.
[02:04:25.970 --> 02:04:26.510]  That's right.
[02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:31.652]  And I saw you, you were on the line for 20 minutes with Roger Stone while we were finishing the speech he went over.
[02:04:31.652 --> 02:04:34.494]  And I saw you had tears in your eyes when Trump was saying that.
[02:04:34.494 --> 02:04:35.114]  And that's the difference.
[02:04:35.114 --> 02:04:36.394]  They think we're weak because we care.
[02:04:36.394 --> 02:04:37.875]  No, we're strong because we care.
[02:04:37.875 --> 02:04:40.316]  Dr. Corsi, I'm signing that lease to get the Bureau going.
[02:04:40.316 --> 02:04:42.397]  We're going to get those offices right there where you want them.
[02:04:42.397 --> 02:04:43.678]  I'm going to sign that today.
[02:04:43.678 --> 02:04:44.818]  And we're going to get this moving forward.
[02:04:44.818 --> 02:04:46.919]  We're going to start getting that crew hired.
[02:04:46.919 --> 02:04:48.720]  They heard us last week, but the listeners came through.
[02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:50.841]  So we're going to get the Washington Bureau set up.
[02:04:50.841 --> 02:04:51.221]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:52.150 --> 02:04:53.874]  Great, I'm excited about it and look forward to it.
[02:04:53.874 --> 02:04:54.195]  Thank you.
[02:04:54.195 --> 02:04:55.117]  Alright, thank you.
[02:04:55.117 --> 02:04:55.959]  That's right.
[02:04:55.959 --> 02:04:57.242]  The Washington, D.C.
[02:04:57.242 --> 02:04:59.426]  Command Center of the People's Media.
[02:04:59.426 --> 02:04:59.867]  Stay with us.
[02:05:01.641 --> 02:05:06.102]  Just when you thought the progressive left couldn't sink any lower.
[02:05:06.102 --> 02:05:15.303]  Last night's Trump speech to Congress gave liberals yet another opportunity to showcase their ignorance and lack of respect for the country.
[02:05:15.303 --> 02:05:25.205]  Right after President Trump finished his historic address to Congress, the usual suspects, like Michael Moore, appeared on television to bash Donald Trump.
[02:05:25.205 --> 02:05:29.086]  This time for honoring, wait for it, veterans.
[02:05:29.506 --> 02:05:31.227]  I'm gonna get an Emmy for this.
[02:05:31.227 --> 02:05:35.229]  Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch.
[02:05:35.229 --> 02:05:37.991]  I mean, this is the sickness of this man.
[02:05:37.991 --> 02:05:53.559]  Meanwhile, other liberals, like Hillary Clinton volunteer Dan Grillo, posted vulgar remarks on Twitter, calling the widow honored during Trump's speech an idiot, proving once again that liberalism is truly a mental disorder.
[02:05:53.559 --> 02:05:57.481]  I'm Darren McBrain, and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:00.424 --> 02:06:02.245]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:06:02.245 --> 02:06:08.849]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:06:08.849 --> 02:06:12.010]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:12.010 --> 02:06:21.796]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[02:06:21.796 --> 02:06:22.636]  Caveman.
[02:06:22.636 --> 02:06:27.699]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:06:27.699 --> 02:06:29.820]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:33.261]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:06:33.261 --> 02:06:38.403]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:06:38.403 --> 02:06:46.546]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:06:46.546 --> 02:06:54.489]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:06:54.489 --> 02:06:59.171]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself, and fullwarslife.com today.
[02:06:59.824 --> 02:07:00.644]  Hey everyone!
[02:07:00.644 --> 02:07:06.766]  Pharmcist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:07:06.766 --> 02:07:08.847]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:07:08.847 --> 02:07:19.130]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:07:19.130 --> 02:07:25.112]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:07:25.572 --> 02:07:40.409]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[02:07:40.549 --> 02:07:41.110]  I think so.
[02:08:05.572 --> 02:08:15.220]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:23.806]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:23.806 --> 02:08:28.230]  And the colors of the sea bind your eyes with trembling mammoths.
[02:08:30.012 --> 02:08:31.173]  Eric Clapton.
[02:08:31.173 --> 02:08:35.317]  He's one of my favorite musicians.
[02:08:35.317 --> 02:08:38.280]  What a prolific career.
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:40.842]  He's been around 50 plus years.
[02:08:40.842 --> 02:08:45.066]  Listen to this guitar.
[02:08:45.066 --> 02:08:48.409]  Imagine if they had performed this now with a recording they've got.
[02:08:51.094 --> 02:08:57.598]  Yeah, if I wasn't here fighting the Globalist, I would be on a distant shore in the Pacific.
[02:08:57.598 --> 02:08:57.898]  100%.
[02:08:57.898 --> 02:09:02.701]  Man, the spirit out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean is so calm.
[02:09:19.088 --> 02:09:24.049]  It's like inviting death though.
[02:09:24.049 --> 02:09:27.810]  So old, so clean.
[02:09:27.810 --> 02:09:32.071]  Here's the last part.
[02:09:32.071 --> 02:09:34.691]  Her name is Aphrodite!
[02:09:34.691 --> 02:09:36.412]  Alright, enough of that.
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:51.801]  Not an infomercial, but be sure to go to iTunes.
[02:09:51.801 --> 02:09:55.182]  Even though they ban us from it, you can download your best of cream.
[02:09:55.182 --> 02:09:58.964]  And Eric Clapton.
[02:09:58.964 --> 02:10:02.205]  Okay, let's get serious here.
[02:10:02.205 --> 02:10:02.385]  Wow.
[02:10:04.339 --> 02:10:05.880]  This happens all the time, and I totally get it.
[02:10:05.880 --> 02:10:14.982]  He's got so many investigations going on, so much stuff he's handling, that about half the time, even when he schedules for this, when he wants to come on, he gives us a lot of exclusives, and I appreciate it.
[02:10:14.982 --> 02:10:22.924]  And he said, I'm not ready to give us the exclusive, and something came up, so they're holding on to something they were going to publish, and I guess the next few days, he will come on.
[02:10:22.924 --> 02:10:25.005]  That's ProjectVeritas.com, James O'Keefe.
[02:10:27.023 --> 02:10:28.184]  So we'll see what's going on.
[02:10:28.184 --> 02:10:32.065]  Whatever it was big that he was going to break here and also talk about the CNN tapes released last week.
[02:10:32.065 --> 02:10:34.166]  We'll get him on obviously in the next few days.
[02:10:34.166 --> 02:10:40.448]  That's fine because I've been promising to go to more calls and I'm encouraging David Knight and others who's just as bad as I am.
[02:10:40.448 --> 02:10:44.030]  We just want to cover news and then kind of don't get the call sometimes to take your phone calls.
[02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:47.170]  I'm trying to get better about not making you sit there on hold.
[02:10:47.170 --> 02:10:48.911]  I'm still bad, but not as bad as I used to be.
[02:10:48.911 --> 02:10:48.971]  800-259-9231.
[02:10:48.971 --> 02:10:49.051]  800-259-9231.
[02:10:49.051 --> 02:10:50.072]  I'm going to say it again.
[02:10:50.072 --> 02:10:50.812]  First-time callers.
[02:10:50.812 --> 02:10:55.255]  People that haven't been able to get through, or folks that have been on hold and I didn't get to you.
[02:10:55.255 --> 02:10:55.315]  800-259-9231.
[02:10:55.315 --> 02:10:55.415]  800-259-9231.
[02:10:55.415 --> 02:10:57.276]  About last night's speech.
[02:10:57.276 --> 02:10:57.876]  About where the world's going.
[02:10:57.876 --> 02:10:58.136]  About Oprah.
[02:10:58.136 --> 02:10:58.777]  I want to get to Oprah.
[02:10:58.777 --> 02:10:59.557]  And, you know, if you guys
[02:11:14.923 --> 02:11:23.252]  If you want to call in and disagree with me about my gushing over Trump, please call in and make your real point.
[02:11:23.252 --> 02:11:25.134]  I don't like the asset forfeiture seizures.
[02:11:25.134 --> 02:11:26.336]  A lot of that's unconstitutional.
[02:11:28.114 --> 02:11:30.516]  But then Trump's like, we could take yachts away from drug dealers.
[02:11:30.516 --> 02:11:34.280]  Yeah, but not old ladies cash in East Texas in those corrupt towns.
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:40.846]  Most of them aren't corrupt, but when you get a bad town, and unfortunately, Texas has got the best and the worst of police.
[02:11:40.846 --> 02:11:43.449]  And there are some bad places in East Texas.
[02:11:43.449 --> 02:11:45.711]  My family, by the way, on my dad's side, is from there.
[02:11:45.711 --> 02:11:51.056]  So I know, I'm not bashing people, but it's like an extension of the worst parts of Louisiana.
[02:11:51.056 --> 02:11:52.117]  Great people in Louisiana, too.
[02:11:52.958 --> 02:11:56.641]  We all know Louisiana's got its problem with corrupt police in some areas.
[02:11:56.641 --> 02:12:00.524]  And it just kind of extends in.
[02:12:00.524 --> 02:12:03.146]  I've never really seen a lot of white racism in my life.
[02:12:03.146 --> 02:12:04.087]  I really haven't.
[02:12:04.087 --> 02:12:07.890]  I've seen whites scared, because the media makes them scared of everybody, and overly guilty.
[02:12:07.890 --> 02:12:18.939]  But I have been in East Texas, pulled over at 16 years of age, with a half-drunk six-pack of beer, two girls in the car, my buddy coming back from the beach, driving back to Dallas.
[02:12:18.939 --> 02:12:20.581]  And because we both had blonde hair,
[02:12:21.721 --> 02:12:28.484]  The sheriff's deputy rolled up his sleeve with a big swastika and said, Hol Hitler, enjoy your beer.
[02:12:28.484 --> 02:12:32.525]  And I remember driving off going, man, it'd suck if you were black and got pulled over by that guy.
[02:12:32.525 --> 02:12:41.088]  Anyways, I'm gonna go off on a, you've gotta have checks and balances on everybody.
[02:12:41.088 --> 02:12:47.671]  Because you can get pulled into a place run by black folks, and if they're racist, then they're gonna, well, white people did something to me, I'm gonna do something to you.
[02:12:47.671 --> 02:12:50.452]  That's why you don't do something to somebody because of what color they are.
[02:12:51.564 --> 02:13:12.557]  You go off what somebody does and what they stand for and who they are, like Martin Luther King said, you don't go off of, and I've had, for the racist white stuff I've seen, I've got, I'm not gonna exaggerate, it's just true, 300, 400 to one from black people.
[02:13:12.557 --> 02:13:13.738]  Now, does that mean I hate black people?
[02:13:13.738 --> 02:13:19.302]  Absolutely not, because most black people are great, but there's a large minority of black people that are super racist.
[02:13:21.837 --> 02:13:23.438]  Let me tell you what's even more racist than those black people.
[02:13:23.438 --> 02:13:26.940]  It's the liberals that watch MSNBC now that'll scream at you.
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:28.480]  Hundreds of them when I was in D.C.
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:28.841]  F.U.
[02:13:28.841 --> 02:13:29.881]  white male.
[02:13:29.881 --> 02:13:32.543]  Sometimes a white male would say it.
[02:13:32.543 --> 02:13:33.703]  We've got it on video.
[02:13:33.703 --> 02:13:34.984]  And people are like, that doesn't make sense.
[02:13:38.319 --> 02:13:46.163]  And I've even seen some of the more nationalistic, kind of racist black sites even comment and say stuff about it and go, I think Alex Jones is out of point.
[02:13:46.163 --> 02:13:50.485]  It's weird to watch some cracker tell another cracker, F you, you're white.
[02:13:50.485 --> 02:13:53.286]  I mean, it's just, it's, it's weird.
[02:13:53.286 --> 02:13:54.406]  How did I go off on that, Jag?
[02:13:54.406 --> 02:13:57.428]  Oh, I was talking about asset forfeiture seizures.
[02:13:57.428 --> 02:13:59.549]  See, when I think about a subject, I think about all the angles to it.
[02:14:00.484 --> 02:14:04.849]  If it's adjudicated, if you're caught breaking the law and you've done something and there's laws on the books, then you should do it.
[02:14:04.849 --> 02:14:06.572]  But it should be at the state level.
[02:14:06.572 --> 02:14:16.203]  There's been too much federal control over local police, because the feds lobby to get laws passed where states can't have asset forfeiture, or if they do, 80 plus percent of the money
[02:14:17.250 --> 02:14:18.591]  Go to the General Fund.
[02:14:48.263 --> 02:14:52.165]  So, again, they're our best friend, they're our worst enemy.
[02:14:52.165 --> 02:14:56.988]  Wherever there's power, you're going to have that dichotomy, that paradox.
[02:14:56.988 --> 02:15:00.470]  With great power comes great responsibility, and you need oversight over it.
[02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:01.590]  And that's all I'm saying.
[02:15:01.590 --> 02:15:03.851]  So I don't like Trump on the asset forfeiture seizure thing.
[02:15:03.851 --> 02:15:08.414]  I mean, just, we haven't seen the specific plans yet, but it's just, we already got too much of it.
[02:15:08.414 --> 02:15:10.255]  It's already out of control.
[02:15:10.255 --> 02:15:10.575]  Clearly.
[02:15:10.575 --> 02:15:15.818]  I mean, everybody who's informed, left or right, center, knows that there's an issue there.
[02:15:17.864 --> 02:15:19.065]  You expand on that.
[02:15:19.065 --> 02:15:22.387]  You know, Sessions is, you know, we don't need marijuana sold on street corners.
[02:15:22.387 --> 02:15:23.408]  You know, it hurts a lot of people.
[02:15:23.408 --> 02:15:24.008]  And you know what?
[02:15:24.008 --> 02:15:28.351]  On average, it causes a lot of people to end up not really performing in life.
[02:15:28.351 --> 02:15:30.312]  Other really high-strung people, studies show it helps.
[02:15:30.312 --> 02:15:32.314]  It's better than Prozac.
[02:15:32.314 --> 02:15:40.599]  It is an amaz... No drug, no plant has more medicinal uses than Mary Jane.
[02:15:40.599 --> 02:15:41.860]  I mean, it is a gift from God.
[02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:42.861]  It's thousands of them.
[02:15:42.861 --> 02:15:45.082]  It's incredible.
[02:15:45.082 --> 02:15:46.003]  I want to decriminalize.
[02:15:48.544 --> 02:15:53.745]  And you've got Sessions running around, who I really love, because he's a good guy.
[02:15:53.745 --> 02:16:08.468]  He means what he says, he does what he says, but it's just coming from somebody who is living in the 1940s when they would, in Alabama or Texas, give you, in some cases, 40 years.
[02:16:08.468 --> 02:16:16.570]  My mother knew people in college that got busted with marijuana in the 1960s that served over two decades for a couple of marijuana cigarettes.
[02:16:16.570 --> 02:16:18.090]  Now that's BS, okay?
[02:16:20.319 --> 02:16:21.099]  That's all.
[02:16:21.099 --> 02:16:24.220]  And by the way, I don't like the whole marijuana culture.
[02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:29.963]  They're mad at me because I don't say that they're God and, oh, it's wonderful and their little stoner lifestyles are great.
[02:16:29.963 --> 02:16:32.884]  Playing video games all day, smoking dope all the time.
[02:16:32.884 --> 02:16:43.347]  If you're a super type A personality like Joe Rogan, Joe probably lived till he's 90 years old because he won't have a heart attack because he smokes pot at night.
[02:16:43.347 --> 02:16:49.890]  I mean, Joe Rogan can go, you know, host major programs, I'll just leave it at that, smoking, you know, weed.
[02:16:51.115 --> 02:16:54.256]  I can't get out of a chair smoking the type of marijuana Joe Rogan smokes.
[02:16:54.256 --> 02:17:07.560]  So, again, it's a very strong drug, it's been made a lot stronger, and so it's kind of a victim of its own farming practices, of its own botanical technology development.
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:08.700]  See, I'm spending too much time.
[02:17:08.700 --> 02:17:12.141]  That's why I can't ever get to any of the news, because I just want to pontificate on any subject.
[02:17:13.507 --> 02:17:16.808]  Attorney General Jeff Sessions just hinted at crackdown on legal marijuana.
[02:17:16.808 --> 02:17:20.589]  He didn't hint at it.
[02:17:20.589 --> 02:17:20.969]  He did it.
[02:17:20.969 --> 02:17:23.190]  This is a bad move!
[02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:36.194]  Support police getting training and funding and medical care they need and not demonizing police in the community and holding up the good officers as an example of real community policing.
[02:17:36.194 --> 02:17:39.695]  Make it an honorable profession so we get more good people to be part of it.
[02:17:39.695 --> 02:17:40.215]  Pay them more.
[02:17:41.109 --> 02:17:46.014]  And don't make it be based on revenue generation.
[02:17:46.014 --> 02:17:50.818]  We don't want pirates, we want sheepdogs.
[02:17:50.818 --> 02:17:55.603]  And again, we don't want to run around going after half the young people that smoke pot.
[02:17:55.603 --> 02:17:58.786]  They're not going to quit smoking pot, Senator Sessions.
[02:17:58.786 --> 02:18:02.249]  I know the Attorney General listens to the show, I'll just leave it at that.
[02:18:02.249 --> 02:18:02.510]  I know.
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.625]  I even know behind the scenes there were some moves made to keep before Obama even left him going after me.
[02:18:11.625 --> 02:18:14.928]  And the word was put out, you do that, we're going to overthrow it as soon as we get in.
[02:18:14.928 --> 02:18:17.611]  I mean, Sessions has been one of my biggest allies.
[02:18:17.611 --> 02:18:20.534]  I'm just saying, I'm your ally too, sir.
[02:18:20.534 --> 02:18:24.097]  And you don't want to start a fight with, what's the statistic?
[02:18:24.978 --> 02:18:32.184]  Something like 80% of America admits it smoked marijuana at one time or another, and then the last time I saw it was like 40-something percent smoking on a regular basis.
[02:18:32.184 --> 02:18:34.786]  Guys, Google how many Americans smoke marijuana in studies.
[02:18:34.786 --> 02:18:37.328]  I mean, it varies in the study, but those numbers are pretty accurate.
[02:18:37.328 --> 02:18:41.691]  I've seen it repeatedly.
[02:18:41.691 --> 02:18:43.172]  You can't do this.
[02:18:43.172 --> 02:18:47.616]  I mean, this will be a disaster for Trump, getting young people involved in the Liberty Movement.
[02:18:50.302 --> 02:18:51.523]  Here's the deal, Sessions.
[02:18:51.523 --> 02:18:56.525]  If you call for banning liquor, then I would say it's not hypocritical, but liquor kills a lot.
[02:18:56.525 --> 02:18:58.686]  And I saw the quote from Sessions in my stack.
[02:18:58.686 --> 02:18:59.706]  This is why I'm going off on the shack.
[02:18:59.706 --> 02:19:02.127]  I was going to leave this alone, but I can't handle it.
[02:19:02.127 --> 02:19:07.009]  He said marijuana causes people to be violent and causes violence.
[02:19:07.009 --> 02:19:09.631]  No, it doesn't.
[02:19:09.631 --> 02:19:12.092]  People don't get in fights on marijuana.
[02:19:12.092 --> 02:19:13.092]  They don't speed on it.
[02:19:13.092 --> 02:19:14.513]  They drive 40 in a 60 in the slow lane.
[02:19:18.854 --> 02:19:23.421]  I mean, alcohol causes violence in car wrecks.
[02:19:23.421 --> 02:19:24.623]  And by the way, that's my cup of tea.
[02:19:24.623 --> 02:19:27.928]  I'm just being honest about it.
[02:19:27.928 --> 02:19:28.589]  It's just crazy.
[02:19:31.155 --> 02:19:32.015]  Does one in eight U.S.
[02:19:32.015 --> 02:19:33.276]  adults say they smoke marijuana?
[02:19:33.276 --> 02:19:36.996]  Paul says, I've seen numbers at University of the Real Study, it's higher than that.
[02:19:36.996 --> 02:19:42.458]  Well, look, George Soros, though, is for it, and that's why I don't want to push everybody because it's so weaponized.
[02:19:42.458 --> 02:19:43.758]  He wants you all zombied out.
[02:19:43.758 --> 02:19:50.640]  I want to try to balance this, and I just think it'll derail much of Trump's agenda to restore the republic if he does this.
[02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:51.820]  He should be more libertarian about it.
[02:19:51.820 --> 02:19:54.161]  All right, I'm going to come back, give the number out, 800-25-9931.
[02:19:54.161 --> 02:19:56.741]  A bunch of news.
[02:19:56.741 --> 02:19:57.702]  Oprah wants to be president.
[02:19:57.702 --> 02:19:58.542]  We got that club, too.
[02:19:58.542 --> 02:19:58.922]  Stay with us.
[02:20:00.526 --> 02:20:03.107]  Guys, are you tired of being tired?
[02:20:03.107 --> 02:20:06.568]  Frustrated because it seems impossible to lose belly fat?
[02:20:06.568 --> 02:20:09.489]  If you're looking for a solution, then listen to Mark.
[02:20:09.489 --> 02:20:13.171]  I had fantastic results with the Andro 400 Max.
[02:20:13.171 --> 02:20:15.412]  Probably lost 35 pounds.
[02:20:15.412 --> 02:20:21.254]  And more impressive than that was the inches I lost off of my belly and my waist.
[02:20:21.254 --> 02:20:23.855]  And the increased energy is fantastic.
[02:20:23.855 --> 02:20:26.416]  I'll be totally honest, I tried a different product.
[02:20:27.017 --> 02:20:29.500]  And I wasn't happy with the different products.
[02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:32.723]  You guys are considerably cheaper than the other brands.
[02:20:32.723 --> 02:20:35.707]  And I can really feel the difference.
[02:20:35.707 --> 02:20:36.608]  Andro 400 Max.
[02:20:36.608 --> 02:20:39.652]  The extra strength, all natural testosterone booster.

[02:21:00.817 --> 02:21:02.519]  Hi there, Dick Allgaier here.
[02:21:02.519 --> 02:21:06.882]  I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[02:21:06.882 --> 02:21:10.365]  I normally never do commercial endorsements.
[02:21:10.365 --> 02:21:13.048]  I'm very skeptical of health supplements.
[02:21:13.048 --> 02:21:17.151]  But a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One.
[02:21:17.151 --> 02:21:21.515]  So I purchased a bottle and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now.
[02:21:21.855 --> 02:21:24.856]  I very much dislike so-called energy boosters.
[02:21:24.856 --> 02:21:30.619]  Those little energy drinks that have caffeine and guarana and other things that make your heart race.
[02:21:30.619 --> 02:21:31.739]  This is not that.
[02:21:31.739 --> 02:21:35.000]  My experience with Synergy One has been great.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:36.241]  My mood is better.
[02:21:36.241 --> 02:21:37.622]  My joints feel better.
[02:21:37.622 --> 02:21:42.203]  I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity.
[02:21:42.203 --> 02:21:45.805]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more.
[02:21:45.805 --> 02:21:47.806]  So I recommend Synergy One.
[02:21:47.806 --> 02:21:48.886]  It's really good stuff.
[02:21:48.886 --> 02:21:50.667]  I'm having great results with it.

[02:23:54.582 --> 02:23:58.044]  Freedom Project Academy, a Judeo-Christian online school.
[02:24:01.485 --> 02:24:04.807]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:24:04.807 --> 02:24:08.070]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:09.801 --> 02:24:11.682]  You know, I don't know why I talked to Dr. Spiegel.
[02:24:11.682 --> 02:24:17.524]  I agreed to it months ago, and then right when they came here, it was the issue with the Statue of Liberty getting her head cut off.
[02:24:17.524 --> 02:24:21.326]  Dr. Spiegel's done some good stuff, like the CIA running a lot of the German media.
[02:24:21.326 --> 02:24:23.007]  So I said, oh, because they're interesting.
[02:24:23.007 --> 02:24:24.067]  I turned down most interviews.
[02:24:24.067 --> 02:24:25.868]  I'm like, 100 to 1, I turned them down.
[02:24:25.868 --> 02:24:28.089]  But I said, they can come on down here.
[02:24:28.089 --> 02:24:31.130]  And the guy got down here, and then he had this photographer who was in Austin.
[02:24:31.130 --> 02:24:34.011]  We're going to call him and see if he remembers this.
[02:24:34.011 --> 02:24:37.252]  And it's not that big a deal, except I would never say this.
[02:24:37.252 --> 02:24:38.173]  And I've talked to the whole crew.
[02:24:39.731 --> 02:25:00.148]  Unless we were talking about an interview about pizza gay and how, quote, Obama ordered $65,000 worth of hot dogs to a private party in Chicago, and that's according to the FBI manuals, that means gay escorts.
[02:25:00.148 --> 02:25:01.429]  And the point is we're just reporting on this.
[02:25:03.336 --> 02:25:29.117]  But I was going back there to eat, I dumped, I was opening this thing of, so I was eating in a hurry, it used to be on air, I was off air, I opened this thing of barbecue sauce and it splattered on my shirt, they're coming around the corner to come in, and sometimes I'll be honest, I keep it real cold around here, I have this thing where I get hot easy, I took my shirt off, and it was also kind of, I don't give a crap, every time I do that in the media, it's like some big huge sensation, so I took my shirt off,
[02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:32.042]  And they said, oh, it was some form of dominance or something.
[02:25:32.042 --> 02:25:36.766]  And then he says that I said, do you, I've got a sausage, do you want to suck it?
[02:25:36.766 --> 02:25:38.347]  And held out a sausage to him.
[02:25:38.347 --> 02:25:40.489]  Because I did say, get them barbecued.
[02:25:40.489 --> 02:25:42.210]  They were back there eating it when I went back there.
[02:25:42.210 --> 02:25:45.513]  I just talked to Nico, he remembers ordering them barbecued.
[02:25:45.513 --> 02:25:47.655]  So I go back there after the show, they're eating their barbecue.
[02:25:47.655 --> 02:25:51.298]  They're out of the room, they come back in, I get some barbecue sauce out, screw it, I'll take the shirt off.
[02:25:51.298 --> 02:25:54.380]  I was about to go back to my office and change shirts.
[02:25:54.380 --> 02:25:56.102]  So that was my stunt.
[02:25:56.102 --> 02:25:58.323]  And they turn it into some homoerotic thing.
[02:25:59.306 --> 02:26:03.951]  Which, I challenged the Roger Spiegel guy, I think he was recording stuff, to release it.
[02:26:03.951 --> 02:26:06.954]  Because if that's the case, then I'm starting to blip out sometimes.
[02:26:06.954 --> 02:26:08.756]  Because, I literally...
[02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:11.460]  Literally.
[02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:15.401]  Don't ever say stuff like that to men or women.
[02:26:15.401 --> 02:26:18.462]  The only jokes about that have been, do you want succulent hot dogs?
[02:26:18.462 --> 02:26:20.322]  And I'd forgotten about the Der Spiegel article yesterday.
[02:26:20.322 --> 02:26:23.263]  I mentioned, you know, Pizzagate and, you know, succulent hot dogs.
[02:26:23.263 --> 02:26:28.504]  And Owen Schroyer, who was in the other studio, goes, oh yeah, like succulent sausages?
[02:26:28.504 --> 02:26:30.384]  Then Jones gets up and holds out a sausage.
[02:26:30.384 --> 02:26:31.104]  Want a suck?
[02:26:31.104 --> 02:26:32.564]  He asked.
[02:26:32.564 --> 02:26:35.445]  We're guessing that it actually, how Jones eats every single meal.
[02:26:37.287 --> 02:27:06.667]  So now it's in, I mean, New York Daily News, a bunch of other, like Alex Jones is very rude to eat with, Alex Jones wants men to suck his sausage, you know, again, ladies and gentlemen, it's just shocking to me that, I believe I didn't say that, genuinely, but it's hard to believe that I would let those guys in here and then they would not be able to stand the fact that I archetypally took my shirt off so that I could, you know, basically
[02:27:07.827 --> 02:27:10.388]  Throw it in their face.
[02:27:10.388 --> 02:27:12.489]  Turning, you know, lemonades into lemonade.
[02:27:12.489 --> 02:27:17.872]  And then it's not about how the Texan got us barbecued and was nice to us.
[02:27:17.872 --> 02:27:25.736]  It was all just, he comes in and he wants a big plate of food and he sits down there like a big pig and starts eating it and he throws sausages in our face.
[02:27:25.736 --> 02:27:28.537]  I'm going to go to break and come back and take your calls.
[02:27:28.537 --> 02:27:29.518]  This is a short segment.
[02:27:29.518 --> 02:27:32.099]  But it isn't even that important.
[02:27:32.099 --> 02:27:32.799]  But I get it.
[02:27:32.799 --> 02:27:35.640]  He had to do a stunt.
[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:36.481]  Just like I did a stunt.
[02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:45.044]  To even get picked up, and it did get picked up all over.
[02:27:45.044 --> 02:27:46.405]  So, see?
[02:27:46.405 --> 02:27:49.106]  Word is I haven't seen it yet, it's on TV they're talking about it.
[02:27:49.106 --> 02:27:53.809]  Next it'll be I sexually assaulted Der Spiegel reporter, you know, and cameraman.
[02:27:53.809 --> 02:28:02.415]  Next it'll be that I raped them both, and I'm a dinosaur and a space alien, and you know, and I'm being sarcastic, they'll probably clip that out and say, I raped Der Spiegel reporters.
[02:28:02.415 --> 02:28:04.697]  You know, they do that on the news, they have me going on.
[02:28:04.697 --> 02:28:08.059]  I'm anti-gay, when I actually said, I'm not anti-gay.
[02:28:09.155 --> 02:28:11.736]  But Colbert played the clip last week where I go, I'm anti-gay!
[02:28:11.736 --> 02:28:13.296]  GAY FROGS!
[02:28:13.296 --> 02:28:15.217]  And they say, Joe's obsessed with gay frogs!
[02:28:15.217 --> 02:28:26.440]  No, I covered a report where I was covering the Smithsonian Institute, Nature, Science, where it says most of the frogs are sterile, and the others are either asexual or homosexual.
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:35.143]  From the runoff of the water we're drinking so bad, it's screwing up the sexuality of mammals, you know, the nutria rats, uh, the, uh,
[02:28:37.139 --> 02:28:40.210]  Amphibians, the fish, all of them!
[02:28:40.210 --> 02:28:40.512]  Otters!
[02:28:42.278 --> 02:28:47.301]  But instead of being, you know, caring about, God, what is in our water that's the run-offs doing this to these animals?
[02:28:47.301 --> 02:28:52.183]  It's just, oh, he says that two-thirds of the frogs in Houston are gay.
[02:28:52.183 --> 02:29:01.588]  Which I said is a joke, because the article out of South Texas was two-thirds of the frogs were sterile or asexual or had both sexual organs or didn't know what sex they were.
[02:29:01.588 --> 02:29:03.409]  So I said, see?
[02:29:03.409 --> 02:29:05.310]  Two-thirds of the frogs in Houston are gay.
[02:29:05.310 --> 02:29:06.630]  It was a joke.
[02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:08.712]  Because, man, it's called gallows humor.
[02:29:08.712 --> 02:29:10.973]  I take these really sad, upsetting topics
[02:29:11.713 --> 02:29:17.319]  That I get tired of having to cover, but I gotta warn people not to fear monger, so you know, so we do something.
[02:29:17.319 --> 02:29:19.220]  Like moms found out.
[02:29:19.220 --> 02:29:24.526]  Bisphenol A messes up the sexuality of your kids, causes tumors, causes lower IQs.
[02:29:24.526 --> 02:29:27.529]  Moms stopped buying stuff that was Bisphenol A marked.
[02:29:27.529 --> 02:29:28.049]  And guess what?
[02:29:28.049 --> 02:29:29.751]  It's hard to find Bisphenol A anymore.
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:32.841]  See, it wasn't fear-mongering.
[02:29:32.841 --> 02:29:35.062]  It was, our house is on fire.
[02:29:35.062 --> 02:29:37.263]  Let's put it out together.
[02:29:37.263 --> 02:29:38.843]  Let's be successful.
[02:29:38.843 --> 02:29:39.724]  Let's move forward.
[02:29:39.724 --> 02:29:42.525]  You know, I just realized, I've been doing this on air forever.
[02:29:42.525 --> 02:29:43.746]  Everybody makes jokes, I do that.
[02:29:43.746 --> 02:29:44.606]  Trump does it.
[02:29:44.606 --> 02:29:45.666]  I do this hand signal.
[02:29:45.666 --> 02:29:46.627]  I do this one.
[02:29:46.627 --> 02:29:47.287]  It's crazy.
[02:29:47.287 --> 02:29:48.508]  Is there like a Vulcan mind meld?
[02:29:48.508 --> 02:29:49.708]  Because I'm not copying Trump.
[02:29:49.708 --> 02:29:50.849]  Is he copying me?
[02:29:50.849 --> 02:29:51.389]  I don't think so.
[02:30:01.852 --> 02:30:06.296]  Just when you thought the progressive left couldn't sink any lower.
[02:30:06.296 --> 02:30:15.523]  Last night's Trump speech to Congress gave liberals yet another opportunity to showcase their ignorance and lack of respect for the country.
[02:30:15.523 --> 02:30:25.411]  Right after President Trump finished his historic address to Congress, the usual suspects, like Michael Moore, appeared on television to bash Donald Trump.
[02:30:25.411 --> 02:30:29.294]  This time for honoring, wait for it, veterans.
[02:30:29.594 --> 02:30:31.435]  I'm going to get an Emmy for this.
[02:30:31.435 --> 02:30:35.558]  Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch.
[02:30:35.558 --> 02:30:38.200]  I mean, this is the sickness of this man.
[02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:53.771]  Meanwhile, other liberals like Hillary Clinton volunteer Dan Grillo posted vulgar remarks on Twitter calling the widow honored during Trump's speech an idiot, proving once again that liberalism is truly a mental disorder.

[02:32:00.357 --> 02:32:02.199]  Today we call it bone broth.
[02:32:02.199 --> 02:32:08.804]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:32:08.804 --> 02:32:10.265]  We are now introducing cavemen.
[02:32:10.465 --> 02:32:21.731]  By Infowarsline.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[02:32:21.731 --> 02:32:22.571]  Caveman.
[02:32:22.571 --> 02:32:27.634]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:32:27.634 --> 02:32:29.735]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:32:30.055 --> 02:32:33.197]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:32:33.197 --> 02:32:38.359]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:32:38.359 --> 02:32:46.483]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:32:46.483 --> 02:32:54.347]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:32:54.347 --> 02:32:59.089]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forwardslife.com today.
[02:33:11.713 --> 02:33:13.134]  Fight the good fight.
[02:33:13.134 --> 02:33:14.535]  It's fun to fight back against tyranny.
[02:33:14.535 --> 02:33:15.276]  It makes you stronger.
[02:33:15.276 --> 02:33:23.242]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:33:23.242 --> 02:33:28.706]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:33:28.706 --> 02:33:34.331]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.331 --> 02:33:35.572]  1980s band, Triumph.
[02:33:35.572 --> 02:33:38.714]  Let's listen a little bit to this music.
[02:33:38.714 --> 02:33:39.535]  Great, great lyrics.
[02:33:42.432 --> 02:33:45.654]  We're running out of time.
[02:33:45.654 --> 02:33:50.637]  Remember just a year and a half ago, somebody couldn't win?
[02:33:50.637 --> 02:33:52.958]  But it didn't matter.
[02:33:52.958 --> 02:33:55.520]  The course of history was there.
[02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:58.942]  Don't get discouraged.
[02:33:58.942 --> 02:34:01.624]  Don't be afraid.
[02:34:01.624 --> 02:34:07.307]  We'll make it through another day.
[02:34:07.307 --> 02:34:10.329]  Make it worth the price we pay.
[02:34:10.329 --> 02:34:11.090]  It's how we live!
[02:34:11.977 --> 02:34:22.225]  That defines us.
[02:34:22.225 --> 02:34:24.067]  Think about it.
[02:34:24.067 --> 02:34:25.268]  The magic.
[02:34:25.268 --> 02:34:25.828]  The mystery.
[02:34:25.828 --> 02:34:28.891]  Again, we're on a planet in space.
[02:34:28.891 --> 02:34:30.032]  We don't know where we came from.
[02:34:30.032 --> 02:34:31.873]  We don't know who we are, they say.
[02:34:31.873 --> 02:34:32.634]  But we do!
[02:34:32.634 --> 02:34:34.355]  It's all there in your genetics.
[02:34:34.355 --> 02:34:36.157]  In your spirit.
[02:34:36.157 --> 02:34:36.657]  All of it.
[02:34:36.657 --> 02:34:37.478]  The whole history of it.
[02:34:38.806 --> 02:34:48.574]  And I just can't tell you it because you already know it and you know what the enemy would do if I did tell you.
[02:34:48.574 --> 02:34:50.335]  We know what we have to do.
[02:34:50.335 --> 02:34:56.700]  We've done it before.
[02:34:56.700 --> 02:34:58.281]  Fight the good fight every day.
[02:34:58.281 --> 02:35:02.685]  It's that the end of the song is really, really powerful.
[02:35:02.685 --> 02:35:04.667]  I think I want to read the lyrics sometime to this song on air.
[02:35:06.693 --> 02:35:10.004]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your phone calls, but I promise to play this clip so we will of Oprah Winfrey.
[02:35:12.401 --> 02:35:34.147]  You know, I don't know if Oprah Winfrey, you know, I should say this is my message to Oprah Winfrey, I don't know if she's deceived, I don't know if she is a fellow traveler with fellow Melinda Gates and Ted Turner and David Rockefeller and The Globalist, but she meets with them in secret once a year, we now know, for about 26 years.
[02:35:34.147 --> 02:35:39.609]  That's what the London Guardian and Associated Press and ABC News reported about six, seven years ago.
[02:35:42.677 --> 02:36:02.491]  That they have secret meetings to plot world government and a global government strategy and stratagem, a deceptive strategy, to establish a world government to carry out medical systems, medical tyranny.
[02:36:02.491 --> 02:36:07.274]  Now, a book just came out two weeks ago by Chelsea Clinton.
[02:36:07.274 --> 02:36:10.516]  Rob Jacobson was at a bookstore and saw it.
[02:36:10.516 --> 02:36:11.817]  Global Health Government.
[02:36:14.639 --> 02:36:19.301]  I mean the title is, uh, Governing Global Health.
[02:36:19.301 --> 02:36:26.925]  But it was, it was written for her mother to be the winner and she'd be put as the front, a nice little girl, Webster Hubble's daughter.
[02:36:26.925 --> 02:36:29.487]  Hello, I'm Mr. Red.
[02:36:29.487 --> 02:36:34.369]  A horse is a horse, of course, of course that is, of course, unless a horse is the famous Mr. Red.
[02:36:34.369 --> 02:36:39.992]  Sorry, not insulting what she looks like, but I mean her dad looks like Mr. Red.
[02:36:39.992 --> 02:36:41.613]  And it's just that everything's a lie with them.
[02:36:41.613 --> 02:36:43.614]  It's Webster Hubble's daughter, we know it.
[02:36:45.157 --> 02:36:48.718]  Paul Wilber!
[02:36:48.718 --> 02:36:53.180]  Nobody's talking about Chelsea Clinton's new book, including Chelsea Clinton.
[02:36:53.180 --> 02:37:03.763]  And Oprah Winfrey, like, has this tax-free cult in Africa, where she teaches them, like, magical thinking and, you know, submitting to all this, and then they get sterilized.
[02:37:03.763 --> 02:37:09.945]  I mean, man, she is the black face on Satan's New World Order.
[02:37:09.945 --> 02:37:11.286]  Obama was just the baby.
[02:37:12.449 --> 02:37:13.830]  You know, they admit Oprah got him in.
[02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:14.651]  Oprah boosted him.
[02:37:14.651 --> 02:37:17.233]  Oprah pushed him to the top.
[02:37:17.233 --> 02:37:21.156]  But now they want Oprah Winfrey to wade in a woman and she's black.
[02:37:21.156 --> 02:37:23.618]  I think demographically that people will go for that.
[02:37:23.618 --> 02:37:26.901]  We have to start exposing her now.
[02:37:26.901 --> 02:37:32.325]  It doesn't really matter with her billions of dollars, whether richest entertainer in history.
[02:37:32.325 --> 02:37:36.448]  It doesn't matter if she knows or she doesn't know.
[02:37:36.448 --> 02:37:38.250]  Is a sword conscious when it runs you through?
[02:37:38.250 --> 02:37:39.331]  Doesn't matter.
[02:37:41.220 --> 02:37:43.421]  But Oprah is a smart lady.
[02:37:43.421 --> 02:37:44.501]  She has a lot of charisma.
[02:37:44.501 --> 02:37:45.361]  She's a good manager.
[02:37:45.361 --> 02:37:52.483]  I can unequivocally say that she knows what she's doing.
[02:37:52.483 --> 02:37:57.425]  Now, she may see overpopulation and poverty and stuff, and think it's just better to get rid of all these people so it doesn't keep happening.
[02:37:57.425 --> 02:37:57.805]  No.
[02:37:57.805 --> 02:37:59.985]  You set up a system to empower them all.
[02:37:59.985 --> 02:38:02.186]  And some will still die.
[02:38:02.186 --> 02:38:08.328]  But you don't sit there and just write people off while you live in a palace, lady.
[02:38:08.328 --> 02:38:08.788]  Comprende?
[02:38:12.828 --> 02:38:18.010]  So Oprah Winfrey, and I've told this for a long time, is wicked.
[02:38:18.010 --> 02:38:20.891]  And she's dangerous.
[02:38:20.891 --> 02:38:25.472]  And she's going to be who challenges Trump in three years.
[02:38:25.472 --> 02:38:27.133]  We'll be back in the thick of a campaign.
[02:38:27.133 --> 02:38:29.394]  They now start campaigns a year and a half before.
[02:38:29.394 --> 02:38:33.275]  In three years, in two and a half years, it's going to start.
[02:38:33.275 --> 02:38:36.796]  And Oprah Winfrey is coming.
[02:38:36.796 --> 02:38:38.497]  So understand that.
[02:38:38.497 --> 02:38:40.298]  And we've got to start hitting her and hitting her hard.
[02:38:42.085 --> 02:38:53.955]  Because nobody else, and I'm not bragging, I don't like saying nobody else has done the research we've done on her and what she's up to, because it's like Americans are so insular.
[02:38:53.955 --> 02:39:01.481]  Americans are so... We have the lowest level of any industrialized nation of being passport holders.
[02:39:01.481 --> 02:39:08.447]  So I love America, it has great roots, great possibility, but we've become exceptionally dumb, exceptionally spoiled.
[02:39:08.447 --> 02:39:09.788]  Yeah, there's DrudgeReport.com right now.
[02:39:11.058 --> 02:39:13.000]  Yes, she can!
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:17.503]  And here's the clip of her on a Bloomberg News Show.
[02:39:17.503 --> 02:39:18.584]  Perfect, of course, Bloomberg.
[02:39:18.584 --> 02:39:20.105]  Just as evil.
[02:39:20.105 --> 02:39:21.566]  Oh, I forgot Bloomberg goes to the meetings.
[02:39:21.566 --> 02:39:22.527]  There's like 15 people go.
[02:39:22.527 --> 02:39:23.368]  Bloomberg's there, too.
[02:39:23.368 --> 02:39:29.132]  Ted Turner, David Rockefeller, Herb, Bill and Melinda Gates, Warren Buffett.
[02:39:29.132 --> 02:39:30.553]  She is the only black person there.
[02:39:30.553 --> 02:39:33.275]  And I could tell why.
[02:39:33.275 --> 02:39:35.577]  Imagine getting other black people in there.
[02:39:35.577 --> 02:39:40.001]  You're talking about... I mean, they admitted in the news it's how to reduce the population average.
[02:39:41.411 --> 02:39:41.771]  I love it, man.
[02:39:41.771 --> 02:39:43.892]  Every once in a while I'll be at a restaurant outdoors or something.
[02:39:43.892 --> 02:39:45.532]  It's happened twice outdoors or wherever.
[02:39:45.532 --> 02:39:48.133]  We're at these leftist events and suddenly some racist black folks walk by.
[02:39:48.133 --> 02:39:48.873]  It happened in D.C.
[02:39:48.873 --> 02:39:49.753]  probably.
[02:39:49.753 --> 02:39:52.334]  Happens every once in a while, just in general, but in D.C.
[02:39:52.334 --> 02:39:52.914]  it probably happened.
[02:39:52.914 --> 02:39:53.594]  I'm not trying to exaggerate.
[02:39:53.594 --> 02:39:56.295]  It's on video a bunch, maybe 30 times.
[02:39:56.295 --> 02:39:57.055]  I wasn't paying attention.
[02:39:57.055 --> 02:40:00.676]  Most times I was like, you white devil!
[02:40:00.676 --> 02:40:01.276]  Screw you!
[02:40:01.276 --> 02:40:03.857]  And I'd be like, oh, do you like Obama?
[02:40:03.857 --> 02:40:04.837]  Yeah, I do.
[02:40:04.837 --> 02:40:05.578]  What, you want something?
[02:40:05.578 --> 02:40:06.138]  You want to fight?
[02:40:06.138 --> 02:40:06.858]  And I'm like, oh, yeah.
[02:40:08.667 --> 02:40:15.416]  Then they realize I've got, like, Navy SEALs and, you know, Special Forces people with me, active duty, you name it, and they just kind of back off.
[02:40:15.416 --> 02:40:19.422]  But the point is, is that I don't want to kill them!
[02:40:19.422 --> 02:40:22.526]  I actually don't want them to be aborted before they're born.
[02:40:22.526 --> 02:40:24.649]  I don't want anybody, black, white, doesn't matter, I don't want anybody.
[02:40:26.755 --> 02:40:29.699]  I don't like their spoiled, dumbass, racist crap.
[02:40:29.699 --> 02:40:41.293]  It's like I don't like some toothless Klan guy at a Dairy Queen because I got a hot girlfriend, you know, in 1994 with six guys getting out of a pickup threatening to kick my ass, all because I'm getting a nice car, got a good-looking woman on my arm.
[02:40:42.443 --> 02:40:46.124]  I don't like gang members and dumbasses in groups acting tough.
[02:40:46.124 --> 02:40:51.845]  And let me just explain something to all the black nationals, everybody else that think the liberals and the socialists and the globalists are your friends.
[02:40:51.845 --> 02:40:56.966]  They're the ones that tell you they love you all day because they want you close so they can make sure you never become anything.
[02:40:56.966 --> 02:40:59.207]  They created gangster rap to ruin your communities.
[02:40:59.207 --> 02:41:02.487]  They shipped the cocaine in so you'd use it and kill yourselves.
[02:41:02.487 --> 02:41:06.028]  I'm the best friend and Donald Trump's the best friend you're ever going to have.
[02:41:10.373 --> 02:41:13.654]  That's why Trump has got to convince these people it's the right thing to do.
[02:41:13.654 --> 02:41:18.176]  Nothing's stopping Trump because he's on the right side of history, unless he gets on the wrong side of history himself.
[02:41:18.176 --> 02:41:19.497]  That's a key quote.
[02:41:19.497 --> 02:41:24.059]  Trump cannot be stopped because he's on the right side of history and the will of humanity.
[02:41:24.059 --> 02:41:27.480]  The only person that can betray Donald Trump at this point is Donald Trump.
[02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:34.723]  Because if he lets Sessions, who's a great guy, go on some 1950s drug war garbage that's got Mexico already failing,
[02:41:36.598 --> 02:41:44.945]  Yeah, the cops might have nice cigarette boats and fancy Corvettes they seized, but their kids aren't gonna be safe at school because the society's gonna be imploding.
[02:41:44.945 --> 02:41:48.428]  We gotta decriminalize it to take the money out of it.
[02:41:48.428 --> 02:41:52.051]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls, but here's Oprah Winfrey.
[02:41:52.051 --> 02:41:53.472]  And I don't like to judge people.
[02:41:53.472 --> 02:41:55.133]  I don't like to judge people.
[02:41:55.133 --> 02:41:55.754]  But let me say this.
[02:41:55.754 --> 02:42:01.699]  She is in the house of pure, unadulterated, anti-human death.
[02:42:03.027 --> 02:42:03.808]  Okay.
[02:42:03.808 --> 02:42:19.577]  She is in the highest level meetings that only 15 people go to, and those 15 people run the CFR with 4,000 people, and Davos with 100 or 200 top people and hundreds of guests, or Bilderberg with 150.
[02:42:19.577 --> 02:42:27.001]  She goes into the star chamber meetings.
[02:42:27.001 --> 02:42:28.242]  Lord Rothschild attends.
[02:42:28.242 --> 02:42:29.343]  That's one of the 15.
[02:42:29.343 --> 02:42:29.743]  Look it up.
[02:42:30.948 --> 02:42:36.974]  She gets in on population world government control meetings.
[02:42:36.974 --> 02:42:41.878]  Now what does that tell you about Oprah Winfrey?
[02:42:41.878 --> 02:42:46.622]  I don't want to be her when she's standing before God at the White Throne Judgment.
[02:42:46.622 --> 02:42:48.244]  Here's Oprah.
[02:42:48.244 --> 02:42:57.172]  Have you ever thought that given the popularity you have, we haven't broken the glass ceiling yet for women, that you could actually run for president and actually be elected?
[02:43:10.385 --> 02:43:12.347]  Never thought of that.
[02:43:12.347 --> 02:43:17.554]  I actually never thought that that was I never considered the question even a possibility.
[02:43:17.554 --> 02:43:18.515]  I just thought
[02:43:22.109 --> 02:43:26.392]  Right, because it's clear that you don't need government experience to be elected President of the United States.
[02:43:26.392 --> 02:43:27.553]  That's what I thought!
[02:43:27.553 --> 02:43:31.255]  I thought, oh gee, I don't have the experience, I don't know enough, I don't know.
[02:43:31.255 --> 02:43:32.816]  And now I'm thinking, oh!
[02:43:32.816 --> 02:43:35.318]  Oh, Trump doesn't have experience?
[02:43:35.318 --> 02:43:38.400]  Oh, anybody can be that.
[02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:47.086]  Yeah, building buildings in New York, running over the mafia when you're a teenager, having your own business all over the world, having top-rated shows, producing shows.
[02:43:47.086 --> 02:43:50.248]  He doesn't have any experience, really.
[02:43:50.248 --> 02:43:51.349]  He just beat all of you.
[02:43:52.608 --> 02:43:56.730]  He just ran over the whole New World Order system, ruined your phone calls.
[02:43:56.730 --> 02:43:58.071]  Let me tell you something.
[02:43:58.071 --> 02:44:04.434]  She's dangerous.
[02:44:04.434 --> 02:44:12.198]  God, she's dangerous.
[02:44:12.198 --> 02:44:16.700]  So she's gonna come climbing out of the pit in two and a half years to try to
[02:44:20.407 --> 02:44:22.728]  Try to stop us.
[02:44:22.728 --> 02:44:24.489]  God Almighty.
[02:44:24.489 --> 02:44:26.971]  Look at that power trip.
[02:44:26.971 --> 02:44:31.753]  Look at that arrogance.
[02:44:31.753 --> 02:44:36.496]  She exudes this fake confidence, this narcissism, and then she sprays it onto the audience.
[02:44:36.496 --> 02:44:37.656]  They all feel like they're with her.
[02:44:37.656 --> 02:44:41.759]  It's a little cutesy event.
[02:44:41.759 --> 02:44:44.820]  That big fat pyramid right in front of everybody.
[02:44:44.820 --> 02:44:47.202]  Letting folks know we're on top, you're on bottom.
[02:44:48.789 --> 02:44:53.631]  Instead of the circle, like the sun, the circle of light.
[02:44:53.631 --> 02:44:57.032]  The circle will become complete with you as well, Oprah.
[02:44:57.032 --> 02:44:58.773]  You're on the wrong side of history.
[02:44:58.773 --> 02:45:03.395]  All right, covering that, analyzing that Bloomberg piece.
[02:45:03.395 --> 02:45:05.075]  Briefly, we're going to end the special.
[02:45:05.075 --> 02:45:14.139]  We started running last Monday, one of our biggest specials ever, dealing with the fact that they announced via AdRoll that we're not allowed to advertise on Google.
[02:45:15.774 --> 02:45:16.675]  We're dehumanized.
[02:45:16.675 --> 02:45:17.575]  We don't exist.
[02:45:17.575 --> 02:45:19.036]  And so you really came through.
[02:45:19.036 --> 02:45:22.798]  We've brought in about half the money we lost that was budgeted for the next year.
[02:45:22.798 --> 02:45:26.340]  We can project what it's going to bring in.
[02:45:26.340 --> 02:45:27.501]  So that's a big victory.
[02:45:27.501 --> 02:45:28.442]  Thank you so much.
[02:45:28.442 --> 02:45:31.904]  And with a few other specials and things down the road, I hope we can, you know, bring in the rest we need.
[02:45:31.904 --> 02:45:33.344]  I'm signing the lease today for the D.C.
[02:45:33.344 --> 02:45:34.745]  Bureau.
[02:45:34.745 --> 02:45:38.247]  And I'm going to start hiring a few people to help Corsi and then other crew and the rest of it.
[02:45:38.247 --> 02:45:41.309]  So it's not like, you know, it's the end all be all.
[02:45:41.309 --> 02:45:43.470]  But, you know, having an operation there in D.C., it's important.
[02:45:43.470 --> 02:45:44.031]  So we're going to do it.
[02:45:44.684 --> 02:45:49.407]  Because before we didn't have a beach yet there, it was just both parties controlled, and what's the point now?
[02:45:49.407 --> 02:45:50.227]  We're beginning to win.
[02:45:50.227 --> 02:45:51.108]  We have to get ready to win.
[02:45:51.108 --> 02:45:53.409]  We have to be ready to take action.
[02:45:53.409 --> 02:45:55.010]  And not just sit here and stay where we're at.
[02:45:55.010 --> 02:45:55.811]  It's destiny.
[02:45:55.811 --> 02:45:57.732]  It must be done.
[02:45:57.732 --> 02:45:59.873]  And I've told you every step of the way, we're going to the next level.
[02:45:59.873 --> 02:46:00.494]  We're going to the next level.
[02:46:00.494 --> 02:46:01.114]  We're going to the next level.
[02:46:01.114 --> 02:46:01.614]  And we always do it.
[02:46:01.614 --> 02:46:02.975]  And we're going to elect a president.
[02:46:02.975 --> 02:46:05.217]  We're going to reverse NAFTA and GATT and TPP.
[02:46:05.217 --> 02:46:06.177]  And we're going to cut the taxes.
[02:46:06.177 --> 02:46:08.439]  We're going to turn the coal power plants back on.
[02:46:08.439 --> 02:46:11.040]  And it's all happening, and they're howling in anger.
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:11.701]  Oh really?
[02:46:11.701 --> 02:46:13.542]  You thought you were the only ones that could fight?
[02:46:15.367 --> 02:46:19.490]  You told us you were the boss, and that you were invincible, and that you were the only people in the world that counted.
[02:46:19.490 --> 02:46:20.030]  Well, guess what?
[02:46:20.030 --> 02:46:22.572]  That's not the way it works.
[02:46:22.572 --> 02:46:27.475]  I learned that when I was very, very young.
[02:46:27.475 --> 02:46:37.501]  What, some bully thinks they're gonna, because they're 15 and you're 12, because they weigh 60 pounds more than you, they're gonna jump on top of you and beat you up for no reason when you're walking home from the school bus?
[02:46:37.501 --> 02:46:42.925]  You know, they do it once when you're 11.
[02:46:42.925 --> 02:46:44.526]  Now you're 12, you've been in a few fights.
[02:46:46.118 --> 02:46:56.742]  They take a swing, you jump on top of them, ram their head in the concrete, knock them out, and then the police come.
[02:46:56.742 --> 02:47:03.685]  Neighbor lady sitting there on her porch says, I saw that big, big boy attack that one.
[02:47:03.685 --> 02:47:05.886]  Well, that's just the way it is.
[02:47:05.886 --> 02:47:07.266]  And see, that's how it is.
[02:47:07.266 --> 02:47:08.767]  You think you're going to climb up on top of us?
[02:47:08.767 --> 02:47:10.868]  We're going to kick your ass up and down the street.
[02:47:10.868 --> 02:47:11.688]  Just get ready for it.
[02:47:12.739 --> 02:47:17.821]  And by the way, culturally, politically, we're not 12 anymore.
[02:47:17.821 --> 02:47:19.202]  And the enemy knows that.
[02:47:19.202 --> 02:47:26.005]  We're like a 800-pound wrecking machine.
[02:47:26.005 --> 02:47:37.411]  And the globalists, if the humanity ever fully awakens, are like a 75-pound scarecrow, starving vampire that can hardly get out of its wheelchair.
[02:47:39.531 --> 02:47:41.151]  And that's what's so frustrating.
[02:47:41.151 --> 02:47:48.513]  When we defeat these people and humanity goes to the next level, we're going to look back on this and ask, that's what, you know, in Revelation, I forget the passage.
[02:47:48.513 --> 02:47:49.053]  Can you guys look it up?
[02:47:49.053 --> 02:47:49.973]  I'm going to go to the calls.
[02:47:49.973 --> 02:47:54.274]  I'm going to take calls in the next hour with David out a little bit.
[02:47:54.274 --> 02:47:58.355]  I'll do 20 minutes with him and take calls, but I'm going to go to calls here in the next segment.
[02:47:58.355 --> 02:48:05.277]  Imagine somewhere in the Bible, I forget all the passages, but like the devil is locked up for a thousand years for everybody to look at him.
[02:48:06.604 --> 02:48:12.209]  And people come and they say, that's who did this, that's who conquered us, that's who did all these horrible things?
[02:48:12.209 --> 02:48:25.621]  So Google, what passages is it where everybody marvels that the devil's locked up in a cage and they say, this is who did all that?
[02:48:25.621 --> 02:48:26.481]  Satan bound?
[02:48:26.481 --> 02:48:32.647]  And then I saw thrones and then sat on them, the judgment was committed to them.
[02:48:33.314 --> 02:48:53.261]  Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus, the Word of God, who had worshipped the beast or his image, and not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands, and they that lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years, those that didn't take the digital system, those that ran to the hills under the one world government system.
[02:48:53.261 --> 02:48:57.742]  But the rest of the dead did not live until a thousand years was finished.
[02:48:57.742 --> 02:48:59.803]  This is the first resurrection.
[02:48:59.803 --> 02:49:01.604]  Where's the part where the devil's bound?
[02:49:02.827 --> 02:49:04.288]  Satanic Rebellion crushed.
[02:49:04.288 --> 02:49:08.790]  See if you can look in there, I'm going to find that part where they're pointing the cage saying, this is what did this?
[02:49:08.790 --> 02:49:11.851]  Is this a joke?
[02:49:11.851 --> 02:49:17.313]  Whether you believe that physically is coming or an archetype of it, the point is, buying or selling out of this control system?
[02:49:17.313 --> 02:49:19.354]  Who thought this up 2,000 years ago?
[02:49:19.354 --> 02:49:24.037]  What was John the Revelator taking on the Isle of Patmos?
[02:49:24.037 --> 02:49:25.057]  Was he looking into the future?
[02:49:25.057 --> 02:49:29.239]  Is Donald Trump from the future?
[02:49:29.239 --> 02:49:29.399]  Now,
[02:49:33.444 --> 02:49:38.206]  Continuing here with the news and the information.
[02:49:38.206 --> 02:49:40.568]  We're ending that special today.
[02:49:40.568 --> 02:49:42.348]  It'll be done in the morning.
[02:49:42.348 --> 02:49:45.410]  We might extend it today, but we really can't because we're running out of X2.
[02:49:45.410 --> 02:49:46.591]  We're running out of Brain Force.
[02:49:46.591 --> 02:49:49.072]  We're about to sell out of the Donald J. Trump and Ronald Reagan lithographs.
[02:49:49.072 --> 02:49:53.294]  In fact, I may just hold something back and raise the price when we're done with the operation.

[02:50:15.699 --> 02:50:16.219]  It's amazing.

[02:50:21.423 --> 02:50:23.925]  We basically don't make money on that.
[02:50:23.925 --> 02:50:25.967]  But Lost Leaders for folks that sign up for the newsletter.
[02:50:25.967 --> 02:50:30.110]  So if stuff gets really bad, we've got to grow the email list where we may just be able to communicate with you in the future via email.
[02:50:31.980 --> 02:50:36.083]  I'm told if you've got an email list, skip this break because we might not even have a show soon, who knows.
[02:50:36.083 --> 02:50:40.047]  I'm told that by the top people, they said you're crazy.
[02:50:40.047 --> 02:50:41.848]  For only the last four years trying to build an email list.
[02:50:41.848 --> 02:50:47.032]  Man, in the age of email, a show your size would have 10 million emails by now.
[02:50:47.032 --> 02:50:48.974]  Like Newsmax, who are the best out there at that.
[02:50:50.199 --> 02:50:51.780]  And I'm just, well, I just thought we should move it forward.
[02:50:51.780 --> 02:50:53.320]  You don't want to sit there and mess with the list.
[02:50:53.320 --> 02:51:00.923]  Well, I've been told the way to get ahold of people during a crisis, with a thumb drive, I can shoot a video or have an article and send it out to you.
[02:51:00.923 --> 02:51:03.203]  I have to like run to wherever.
[02:51:03.203 --> 02:51:05.844]  Quite frankly, it's not that I'm scared to, you know, have them grab me or kill me or whatever.
[02:51:05.844 --> 02:51:08.505]  It's just that I'm not going to play dumb for them.
[02:51:08.505 --> 02:51:09.866]  I'm going to, you know, whatever has to be done.
[02:51:09.866 --> 02:51:10.826]  I mean, I'm planning to run.
[02:51:10.826 --> 02:51:13.207]  I'm not going to right now.
[02:51:13.207 --> 02:51:14.927]  I want to be an example of going down with a ship.
[02:51:14.927 --> 02:51:15.347]  I'll say this.
[02:51:15.347 --> 02:51:18.168]  I'm not going to die alone in some corner, isolated.
[02:51:18.168 --> 02:51:19.549]  If it's public, then that's another issue.
[02:51:20.572 --> 02:51:22.474]  I'm not going to let them just quietly snuff me out.
[02:51:22.474 --> 02:51:25.416]  It would be a great honor to have them publicly destroy me.
[02:51:25.416 --> 02:51:28.179]  I don't want that, but I'll kind of smile.
[02:51:28.179 --> 02:51:30.881]  They had me lined up on national TV about to chop my head off or whatever.
[02:51:30.881 --> 02:51:34.164]  I've come to defeat these people and to be an example to others.
[02:51:34.164 --> 02:51:36.567]  So, I mean, it's an honor.
[02:51:36.567 --> 02:51:36.987]  An honor.
[02:51:36.987 --> 02:51:37.808]  I'm not afraid to die.
[02:51:37.808 --> 02:51:38.649]  It is an extreme honor.
[02:51:38.649 --> 02:51:40.951]  I mean, you're going to be old
[02:51:42.267 --> 02:51:48.178]  With your teeth falling out, incredible pain, going through hell on earth, and I'll never commit suicide, but let me tell you something.
[02:51:48.178 --> 02:51:54.809]  Going through what my grandmother went through that died a few weeks ago at almost 93, and cancer for six years that she didn't want to get operated on because they cut her other breast off.
[02:51:56.312 --> 02:51:57.152]  She went through hell with that.
[02:51:57.152 --> 02:52:00.893]  She was ready to go back and see God and her family and my grandfather.
[02:52:00.893 --> 02:52:05.714]  But she was still so Christian that she wouldn't even let them put her on opium or stuff and put her in hospice.
[02:52:05.714 --> 02:52:06.794]  She sat there and went through it.
[02:52:06.794 --> 02:52:11.735]  I mean, she went through cancer all over her body by the time she died.
[02:52:11.735 --> 02:52:15.116]  And she went through all of it.
[02:52:15.116 --> 02:52:17.416]  Tough.
[02:52:17.416 --> 02:52:19.537]  Way tougher than I am.
[02:52:19.537 --> 02:52:22.257]  Fear, getting killed by the New World Order, lining me up and shooting me?
[02:52:22.257 --> 02:52:23.257]  That's a hero's death!
[02:52:23.257 --> 02:52:24.278]  That's a Viking's death!
[02:52:24.278 --> 02:52:25.158]  God!
[02:52:25.158 --> 02:52:25.738]  Give me that!
[02:52:27.947 --> 02:52:34.790]  Over losing my mind and being gone and not being able to help people around me and other people have to take care of me.
[02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:35.331]  It's amazing.
[02:52:35.331 --> 02:52:37.452]  All right, I said I'd take your phone calls.
[02:52:37.452 --> 02:52:38.972]  The point is, knockouts 50% off.
[02:52:38.972 --> 02:52:41.013]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:52:41.013 --> 02:52:41.714]  Go there.
[02:52:41.714 --> 02:52:42.134]  Put it in.
[02:52:42.134 --> 02:52:43.054]  It's on the articles.
[02:52:43.054 --> 02:52:43.715]  It's on the pages.
[02:52:43.715 --> 02:52:44.875]  It's not hard to do.
[02:52:44.875 --> 02:52:46.536]  We send out huge specials every day.
[02:52:46.536 --> 02:52:48.437]  50% off on one product every day.
[02:52:49.696 --> 02:52:53.157]  If you're smart and want these products at the very lowest price, you want to be on the newsletter.
[02:52:53.157 --> 02:53:06.422]  Because I pledge you, every day, 365, when they get the emails out, sometimes they, you know, we're not a big enough crew, we will always send out, at least five days a week, I shouldn't say 365, but throughout the year, five days a week, we will send out 50% off on one item every day.
[02:53:06.422 --> 02:53:14.505]  You sign up for AutoShip, get an additional 10% off, and get products that no one can get unless they're a manufacturer at those prices.
[02:53:14.505 --> 02:53:18.266]  I mean, you get 10% off on knockout, at checkout, signing up for AutoShip,
[02:53:19.671 --> 02:53:24.799]  At $9.95, you can't buy a bottle of melatonin with this drink for less than $14.
[02:53:24.799 --> 02:53:26.883]  And that's just one ingredient in it.
[02:53:26.883 --> 02:53:28.605]  I mean, it's a big horse pill.
[02:53:28.605 --> 02:53:29.367]  It's high-powered.
[02:53:30.546 --> 02:53:35.830]  So, Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:53:35.830 --> 02:53:37.091]  We're about to start selling out.
[02:53:37.091 --> 02:53:38.072]  There's like a hundred left.
[02:53:38.072 --> 02:53:41.695]  There were a thousand of the Tennessee Arms with the brass inserts.
[02:53:41.695 --> 02:53:43.156]  Best lower out there.
[02:53:43.156 --> 02:53:44.577]  Absolutely private.
[02:53:44.577 --> 02:53:46.138]  You got to mill it yourself and everything.
[02:53:46.138 --> 02:53:50.982]  There's instructions, video instructions, and instructions that come with it at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:53:50.982 --> 02:53:55.906]  And we're about to sell out a Victory 1 Series, President Donald Trump, limited edition, 80% lower AR receivers.
[02:53:58.007 --> 02:53:59.928]  Cruz said, you think we're going to sell a thousand of those?
[02:53:59.928 --> 02:54:01.528]  And I said, just the work of art.
[02:54:01.528 --> 02:54:03.048]  Laser etched.
[02:54:03.048 --> 02:54:05.729]  A design I came up with.
[02:54:05.729 --> 02:54:09.350]  And I just saw the image and the rest of it put together, but that's it.
[02:54:09.350 --> 02:54:09.870]  Just great to have.
[02:54:09.870 --> 02:54:13.231]  Even if you're not going to ever mill these, it's just good to have in your supply chest.
[02:54:13.231 --> 02:54:16.272]  Good for, you know, to have down the road later.
[02:54:16.272 --> 02:54:19.753]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:54:19.753 --> 02:54:24.354]  We have the new RZ air filtration preparedness masks that are reusable.
[02:54:25.354 --> 02:54:28.436]  And then finally a sponsor, then I promise I'm going to your calls.
[02:54:28.436 --> 02:54:31.358]  Solutions from Science is the next generation PPX model available.
[02:54:31.358 --> 02:54:34.459]  This new model has 60% more power.
[02:54:34.459 --> 02:54:37.301]  You can charge or run most of your electronic devices.
[02:54:37.301 --> 02:54:40.523]  It can jump, start 10 buses in a row.
[02:54:40.523 --> 02:54:46.066]  Solutions from Science PPX allows you to create your own private power grid at your own or even in a remote location.
[02:54:46.066 --> 02:54:47.286]  Go to privatepowergrid.com.
[02:54:47.286 --> 02:54:48.407]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[02:54:50.330 --> 02:54:56.972]  If you don't, I mean if you do buy one right now and you use promo code Alex at the checkout, they'll give you a second energy unit free.
[02:54:56.972 --> 02:54:57.952]  It's already very low priced.
[02:54:57.952 --> 02:54:59.772]  I don't know how they give you one free, but whatever.
[02:54:59.772 --> 02:55:01.953]  They've been sponsors 15 years.
[02:55:01.953 --> 02:55:02.973]  I bought some of these units from them.
[02:55:02.973 --> 02:55:04.093]  They're amazing.
[02:55:04.093 --> 02:55:10.815]  If you, again, get one right now, you get a second one with promo code Alex at privatepowergrid.com.
[02:55:10.815 --> 02:55:16.256]  And so sponsors that also help us fund our operation.
[02:55:16.256 --> 02:55:18.037]  Best new off-the-grid product in 2017.
[02:55:20.856 --> 02:55:22.299]  You can see all the informational videos there.
[02:55:22.299 --> 02:55:22.840]  He's got them all.
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:23.821]  It's very, very easy to use.
[02:55:23.821 --> 02:55:27.988]  I bought one like eight, nine years ago for like four times the price they are now from him.
[02:55:27.988 --> 02:55:30.913]  But things get so much inexpensive now because manufacturing prices have gone down.
[02:55:30.913 --> 02:55:31.394]  It's amazing.
[02:55:31.394 --> 02:55:33.217]  It really is cool.
[02:55:34.369 --> 02:55:35.570]  All right, folks.
[02:55:35.570 --> 02:55:37.031]  Again, as I said, I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[02:55:37.031 --> 02:55:38.832]  I've got some other clips I want to play that I didn't get to.
[02:55:38.832 --> 02:55:53.102]  I know David Knight's got a lot to talk about, and I do, before I leave, want to play the end of his speech where he brings in Providence and God again, and how they could demonize that beautiful moment where he's honoring the widow of the lost Navy SEAL on the Yemen raid, and call her stupid and call her scum.
[02:55:53.102 --> 02:55:54.703]  It's just horrible.
[02:55:57.887 --> 02:56:00.050]  I mean, it's Michael Moore supporting the Arab Spring.
[02:56:00.050 --> 02:56:02.874]  Obama and Michael Moore supported what caused all this.
[02:56:02.874 --> 02:56:10.926]  Then they have the nerve to call Trump an opportunist for honoring this woman.
[02:56:10.926 --> 02:56:11.487]  It's unbelievable.
[02:56:13.393 --> 02:56:14.433]  The proof is in the pudding.
[02:56:14.433 --> 02:56:16.414]  Trump's trying to get jobs, the average person.
[02:56:16.414 --> 02:56:18.475]  He's trying to cut taxes for poor and working people.
[02:56:18.475 --> 02:56:23.037]  He's trying to get loans at 0% interest or close from the Federal Reserve of the people.
[02:56:23.037 --> 02:56:24.397]  And that's why the elite hate him.
[02:56:24.397 --> 02:56:30.040]  He's doing what it takes to empower humanity and build a world based on humans, for humans.
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:36.602]  All right, Janae, Salvador, Tim, Don, Jordan, we're going to your calls right now.
[02:56:36.602 --> 02:56:37.863]  Holding the longest is Salvador.
[02:56:37.863 --> 02:56:39.083]  It's a cool name.
[02:56:39.083 --> 02:56:39.743]  You're on the air.
[02:56:39.743 --> 02:56:40.784]  Thanks for calling from California.
[02:56:42.912 --> 02:56:44.373]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:56:44.373 --> 02:56:50.898]  Well, I mean, I really hope the President doesn't go after, you know, this drug war.
[02:56:50.898 --> 02:56:51.959]  I'm from Mexico.
[02:56:51.959 --> 02:56:59.045]  I'm actually from Mexicali, the Mexico area, where, you know, a lot of the drug trafficking happens, mainly tunnels.
[02:56:59.045 --> 02:57:00.847]  This is pointless, you know?
[02:57:00.847 --> 02:57:09.834]  I hope they... Yeah, the drug war is a nightmare failure, except for wrecking cultures, and we should start decriminalizing now, because we're the next Mexico.
[02:57:11.488 --> 02:57:12.288]  Yes.
[02:57:12.288 --> 02:57:16.990]  At the same time, I'm hoping for other outlets to reach out to the Latino community.
[02:57:16.990 --> 02:57:22.132]  Hopefully a segment in Spanish, you know, because a lot of people are uninformed out there, you know?
[02:57:22.132 --> 02:57:27.113]  Well, like everybody else, they've been brainwashed, but I mean, does Mexico let everybody in from Latin America?
[02:57:27.113 --> 02:57:27.633]  No, they don't.
[02:57:27.633 --> 02:57:28.114]  You can't.
[02:57:28.114 --> 02:57:30.995]  Mexico is rich compared to most third world countries.
[02:57:30.995 --> 02:57:31.915]  It's on the rich end.
[02:57:32.904 --> 02:57:35.226]  So everybody better remember that, you know.
[02:57:35.226 --> 02:57:38.028]  We can't merge with something that is imploded.
[02:57:38.028 --> 02:57:41.290]  We have to build ourselves up and then build up the next country.
[02:57:41.290 --> 02:57:42.191]  And I want to do that.
[02:57:42.191 --> 02:57:43.692]  Mexico is awesome.
[02:57:43.692 --> 02:57:45.273]  I love Mexico.
[02:57:45.273 --> 02:57:46.935]  I love the culture, the food, everything.
[02:57:46.935 --> 02:57:53.640]  I just, it's got that nasty drug culture that's artificial we've got to get rid of.
[02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:54.800]  Yes, absolutely, you see.
[02:57:54.800 --> 02:57:56.462]  But I mean, hopefully reaching out.
[02:57:56.462 --> 02:58:00.585]  I mean, most of the population is brainwashed by Televisa and all the Sopras.
[02:58:01.278 --> 02:58:02.198]  Jorge Ramos.
[02:58:02.198 --> 02:58:06.720]  I mean, we need the next Latino conservative guy to go out there.
[02:58:06.720 --> 02:58:07.061]  I agree.
[02:58:07.061 --> 02:58:10.082]  I've been invited to a prestigious press award in Mexico City.
[02:58:10.082 --> 02:58:11.383]  I don't know, for security reasons, if I could go.
[02:58:11.383 --> 02:58:13.143]  It's one of the most dangerous cities in the world.
[02:58:13.143 --> 02:58:15.624]  But there are a ton of people in Mexico that get what's happening.
[02:58:15.624 --> 02:58:17.645]  We need a Mexican Donald Trump.
[02:58:17.645 --> 02:58:18.526]  Or an Isil Farage.
[02:58:18.526 --> 02:58:18.906]  I mean, don't we?
[02:58:20.660 --> 02:58:21.881]  Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
[02:58:21.881 --> 02:58:29.506]  Because, I mean, it's just... And, I mean, corruption is embedded, it's posted in every aspect of people's lives down there.
[02:58:29.506 --> 02:58:31.487]  It's been the way for years and years.
[02:58:31.487 --> 02:58:36.951]  Exactly, and that's what the Democrats, more than anybody, want, is a culture of corruption where the poor never become wealthy.
[02:58:36.951 --> 02:58:38.232]  It's done by design.
[02:58:38.232 --> 02:58:40.353]  Trump is bucking the peon system.
[02:58:40.353 --> 02:58:44.156]  He's bucking serfdom, neo-feudalistic fascism.
[02:58:44.156 --> 02:58:44.976]  Salvador, stay there.
[02:58:44.976 --> 02:58:45.957]  I'm going to come back to you in a moment.
[02:58:45.957 --> 02:58:46.778]  I want you to have more time.
[02:58:46.778 --> 02:58:48.218]  Because this is key.
[02:58:48.218 --> 02:58:48.699]  This is key.
[02:58:50.305 --> 02:59:01.176]  National Defense Labs and Citizen Armor has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people the true next generation in body armor.
[02:59:01.176 --> 02:59:08.963]  Basically what we're bringing to the InfoWars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[02:59:08.963 --> 02:59:14.889]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[02:59:14.949 --> 02:59:20.973]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[02:59:20.973 --> 02:59:22.114]  I mean, what did they really say about them?
[02:59:22.114 --> 02:59:24.956]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[02:59:24.956 --> 02:59:28.678]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[02:59:28.678 --> 02:59:31.620]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[02:59:31.620 --> 02:59:33.461]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:59:33.461 --> 02:59:34.622]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[02:59:34.622 --> 02:59:35.623]  It's got a 20-year warranty.
[02:59:35.623 --> 02:59:36.283]  It's waterproof.
[02:59:36.283 --> 02:59:36.764]  You can wear it.
[02:59:36.764 --> 02:59:37.464]  It's comfortable.
[02:59:37.464 --> 02:59:39.565]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[02:59:39.565 --> 02:59:41.347]  Again, fund the Info Ward.
[02:59:41.347 --> 02:59:44.068]  Get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes.
[02:59:44.068 --> 02:59:44.709]  It's a win-win.
[02:59:45.810 --> 02:59:45.850]  $200!
[02:59:45.850 --> 02:59:49.092]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:49.092 --> 02:59:52.314]  It's amazing!
[02:59:52.314 --> 02:59:54.916]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:11.859 --> 03:00:13.641]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:13.641 --> 03:00:18.667]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:21.690 --> 03:00:27.511]  Man, I gotta say, the folks that built our new studio, we're building another one as well.
[03:00:27.511 --> 03:00:31.292]  Oh yeah, 95% of what comes in here, folks, goes right back into the fight.
[03:00:31.292 --> 03:00:38.993]  I nested a couple things just so we can fight down the road, but my passion is not a mansion or jet airplanes or whatever.
[03:00:38.993 --> 03:00:43.494]  The few other talk show hosts that have the reach we do are like Oprah Winfrey with her palaces everywhere.
[03:00:43.494 --> 03:00:44.694]  Not that money's bad.
[03:00:44.694 --> 03:00:48.035]  My thrill is, if you're watching on TV, look at David Knight in that studio.
[03:00:48.982 --> 03:00:50.744]  I mean, that is first rate.
[03:00:50.744 --> 03:00:53.527]  The crew, the presentation, this studio.
[03:00:53.527 --> 03:00:54.669]  We're building another studio.
[03:00:54.669 --> 03:00:57.091]  I'm going to sign the lease today.
[03:00:57.091 --> 03:00:58.793]  I had to wait.
[03:00:59.673 --> 03:01:01.574]  We lost $3.3 million last week.
[03:01:01.574 --> 03:01:02.654]  That's what it brought in last year.
[03:01:02.654 --> 03:01:03.995]  That's budgeted for this year.
[03:01:03.995 --> 03:01:06.896]  When Google had us banned off AdRoll, that's devastating.
[03:01:06.896 --> 03:01:13.238]  That was, it just so happened to be just about the, we had $3.4 million last year to budget into this year.
[03:01:13.238 --> 03:01:15.059]  That sounds like a lot, running a media operation.
[03:01:15.059 --> 03:01:16.879]  That's nothing, folks.
[03:01:16.879 --> 03:01:18.100]  Okay?
[03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:20.141]  And, you know, they took it away.
[03:01:20.141 --> 03:01:22.121]  So I got on there and freaked out.
[03:01:22.121 --> 03:01:23.742]  Half that that we lost has come in.
[03:01:23.742 --> 03:01:24.842]  Thank you, listeners.
[03:01:24.842 --> 03:01:25.723]  Thank you, viewers.
[03:01:25.723 --> 03:01:26.203]  Amazing.
[03:01:26.203 --> 03:01:26.543]  Thank you.
[03:01:28.939 --> 03:01:30.661]  Now, they're hitting us with some other stuff, too.
[03:01:30.661 --> 03:01:34.467]  But the point is, I've got confidence that if we have to come to you, you'll support us.
[03:01:34.467 --> 03:01:36.670]  So I'm going to go back to Salvador in California.
[03:01:36.670 --> 03:01:41.216]  We'll go to the break, come back and talk to Janine and Tim and Don and Jordan.
[03:01:41.216 --> 03:01:44.060]  But in one minute, I want Salvador to be able to finish up.
[03:01:44.060 --> 03:01:45.542]  David Knight, tell us what you've got coming up today.
[03:01:46.249 --> 03:01:48.069]  Alex, we're going to talk about the EU.
[03:01:48.069 --> 03:01:50.790]  You know, you were just talking to Ted Malik earlier.
[03:01:50.790 --> 03:01:54.191]  And we've got the EU president saying, stop bashing the EU.
[03:01:54.191 --> 03:01:58.112]  He's talking to other presidents and leaders of European countries.
[03:01:58.112 --> 03:02:00.332]  He said, we can't control this.
[03:02:00.332 --> 03:02:03.453]  We're seeing the same thing from Uber's CEO.
[03:02:03.453 --> 03:02:06.214]  He just had a confrontation with a driver who said, you're killing me.
[03:02:06.214 --> 03:02:07.334]  I'm going bankrupt.
[03:02:07.334 --> 03:02:11.415]  You've cut our prices by 90% in terms of what we're paying.
[03:02:11.415 --> 03:02:13.255]  And the guy says, hey, it's not my fault.
[03:02:13.255 --> 03:02:14.096]  You're a loser.
[03:02:14.096 --> 03:02:15.636]  That's the same thing we're hearing from the EU.
[03:02:15.916 --> 03:02:23.222]  That's right, they seize economies, don't build them for humans, say robots are coming in, and then when you want a job, you're a loser.
[03:02:23.222 --> 03:02:24.543]  No, son of a bitch!
[03:02:24.543 --> 03:02:30.027]  You claim you own us, we're animals in a zoo, then build a habitat that's nice if you're such a god.
[03:02:30.027 --> 03:02:31.808]  No, you say you want us to die.
[03:02:31.808 --> 03:02:33.770]  Well, let me explain how that works.
[03:02:33.770 --> 03:02:36.472]  You're not gonna run to Kauai or Tasmania.
[03:02:36.472 --> 03:02:37.813]  You want us to die?
[03:02:37.813 --> 03:02:40.155]  You're gonna get killed in the process, dumbass!
[03:02:40.745 --> 03:02:41.005]  Go ahead.
[03:03:01.312 --> 03:03:04.094]  The kind of thing that Donald Trump talked about in the speech last night.
[03:03:04.094 --> 03:03:06.115]  He didn't get involved in a lot of details.
[03:03:06.115 --> 03:03:08.697]  But it's something that's going to be coming up in the next couple weeks.
[03:03:08.697 --> 03:03:10.378]  We need to get behind Ted Malik.
[03:03:10.378 --> 03:03:12.359]  We need to get behind things like this border attack.
[03:03:12.359 --> 03:03:12.579]  Absolutely.
[03:03:12.579 --> 03:03:14.180]  We are actually defeating them.
[03:03:14.180 --> 03:03:14.821]  We're winning.
[03:03:14.821 --> 03:03:16.542]  And all the idiots that say I've sold out.
[03:03:16.542 --> 03:03:24.787]  Yeah, I sold out to beating TPP and beating open borders and defeating Obamacare and defeating the globalists and teaching five-year-olds how to have sex with trannies.
[03:03:24.787 --> 03:03:28.670]  Damn right I sold out to Jesus Christ a long time ago.
[03:03:28.670 --> 03:03:29.770]  Let's go back to Salvador.
[03:03:29.770 --> 03:03:30.511]  Go ahead and make your point.
[03:03:32.586 --> 03:03:33.406]  Absolutely.
[03:03:33.406 --> 03:03:38.907]  I mean, just to make a quick point, I came to this country when I was around 10 or 12.
[03:03:38.907 --> 03:03:43.308]  You know, I was taught that, you know, we went to a naturalization process, the legal process.
[03:03:43.308 --> 03:03:45.869]  That was a long process, by the way.
[03:03:45.869 --> 03:03:48.329]  And by the way, my dad... And I agree.
[03:03:48.329 --> 03:03:51.850]  For good people that work hard or have skills, it should be made easier.
[03:03:51.850 --> 03:03:56.971]  They make it hard to push you under the water so they can have a permanent underclass they feed on.
[03:03:56.971 --> 03:03:57.231]  Go ahead.
[03:03:58.800 --> 03:03:59.481]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:03:59.481 --> 03:04:04.088]  But one key thing that my dad said is you're going to assimilate to the American style.
[03:04:04.088 --> 03:04:05.029]  It's a funny thing, right?
[03:04:05.029 --> 03:04:06.351]  I mean, you're going to actually assimilate.
[03:04:06.351 --> 03:04:12.220]  You're actually going to learn English and you're actually going to, I mean, not do the same things that we do in Mexico.
[03:04:12.220 --> 03:04:13.022]  It's just, it's key.
[03:04:14.448 --> 03:04:16.449]  Well, if I moved to Mexico, I'd go native.
[03:04:16.449 --> 03:04:17.130]  I'd do what they did.
[03:04:17.130 --> 03:04:18.571]  I mean, that's the whole point, exactly.
[03:04:18.571 --> 03:04:20.232]  Why did people used to want to come to America?
[03:04:20.232 --> 03:04:22.594]  To get away from the class society.
[03:04:22.594 --> 03:04:24.716]  To get away from centralization.
[03:04:24.716 --> 03:04:28.338]  To get away from, if you weren't in the right group, you can't set up a business.
[03:04:28.338 --> 03:04:29.859]  That's why America was so great.
[03:04:29.859 --> 03:04:33.122]  But under globalism, notice it goes back to feudalism, doesn't it, Salvador?
[03:04:34.551 --> 03:04:35.251]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:04:35.251 --> 03:04:38.352]  I mean, look at the way, look at all the potential that Mexicans have.
[03:04:38.352 --> 03:04:40.193]  The oil they make and all that.
[03:04:40.193 --> 03:04:40.693]  Everything.
[03:04:40.693 --> 03:04:46.455]  They cannot tap into that because there's... The art, the culture, and I'm not just saying that to be patronizing.
[03:04:46.455 --> 03:04:47.756]  I like Mexican food.
[03:04:47.756 --> 03:04:49.857]  I like Mexican movies, Mexican art.
[03:04:49.857 --> 03:04:50.917]  That's what's in my house.
[03:04:50.917 --> 03:04:55.959]  I love Mexican culture that's produced by the Mexican thinkers.
[03:04:55.959 --> 03:04:57.800]  I don't like the Mexican slaves.
[03:04:57.800 --> 03:04:58.340]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:01.647 --> 03:05:06.090]  Just when you thought the progressive left couldn't sink any lower.
[03:05:06.090 --> 03:05:15.316]  Last night's Trump speech to Congress gave liberals yet another opportunity to showcase their ignorance and lack of respect for the country.
[03:05:15.316 --> 03:05:25.203]  Right after President Trump finished his historic address to Congress, the usual suspects, like Michael Moore, appeared on television to bash Donald Trump.
[03:05:25.203 --> 03:05:29.086]  This time for honoring, wait for it, veterans.
[03:05:29.406 --> 03:05:31.227]  I'm gonna get an Emmy for this.
[03:05:31.227 --> 03:05:35.228]  Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch.
[03:05:35.228 --> 03:05:37.990]  I mean, this is the sickness of this man.
[03:05:37.990 --> 03:05:53.356]  Meanwhile, other liberals, like Hillary Clinton volunteer Dan Grillo, posted vulgar remarks on Twitter, calling the widow honored during Trump's speech an idiot, proving once again that liberalism is truly a mental disorder.
[03:05:53.356 --> 03:05:57.478]  I'm Darren McBrain, and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:06:00.097 --> 03:06:03.440]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:06:03.440 --> 03:06:04.581]  They lost.
[03:06:04.581 --> 03:06:05.162]  We won.
[03:06:05.162 --> 03:06:08.265]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[03:06:08.265 --> 03:06:15.172]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[03:06:15.925 --> 03:06:21.768]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[03:06:21.768 --> 03:06:27.890]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:06:27.890 --> 03:06:34.193]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[03:06:34.193 --> 03:06:36.674]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:06:36.914 --> 03:06:38.095]  We're the solution!
[03:06:38.095 --> 03:06:39.096]  Americans!
[03:06:39.096 --> 03:06:40.617]  Ain't nothing more to it than that!
[03:06:40.617 --> 03:06:46.000]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:47.662]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[03:06:47.662 --> 03:06:49.563]  DVDs now available.
[03:06:49.563 --> 03:06:53.005]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[03:06:53.005 --> 03:06:55.167]  Americans need to see this film.

[03:07:45.134 --> 03:07:48.276]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[03:07:57.640 --> 03:08:04.224]  Another world.
[03:08:04.224 --> 03:08:05.204]  Another world.
[03:08:05.204 --> 03:08:08.986]  Another time.
[03:08:08.986 --> 03:08:10.387]  Another time.
[03:08:10.387 --> 03:08:11.647]  In the age of wonder,
[03:08:19.244 --> 03:08:20.325]  Can you feel it?
[03:08:20.325 --> 03:08:25.708]  The return of wonder.
[03:08:25.708 --> 03:08:28.730]  Hidden in the human genetics.
[03:08:28.730 --> 03:08:33.373]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:33.373 --> 03:08:39.397]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:43.405 --> 03:08:46.286]  Stephen Manning wants to burn down the New World Order.
[03:08:46.286 --> 03:08:50.187]  That's burn the face sucker off of our culture.
[03:08:50.187 --> 03:08:55.068]  Not burn down America, not burn down Europe, not burn down Mexico, not burn down China.
[03:08:55.068 --> 03:08:58.689]  But kick authoritarians like the Communist Chinese out.
[03:08:58.689 --> 03:09:00.829]  Remove them!
[03:09:00.829 --> 03:09:02.930]  That starts with Trump saying, you know what?
[03:09:02.930 --> 03:09:05.630]  Taiwan's where the nationalists and the real government ran.
[03:09:05.630 --> 03:09:06.270]  No.
[03:09:06.270 --> 03:09:08.171]  We're going to follow our defense pact with Taiwan.
[03:09:08.171 --> 03:09:09.151]  I want to get to David Nikes.
[03:09:09.151 --> 03:09:12.432]  He's got a bunch of clips from the speech last night that was so good
[03:09:14.252 --> 03:09:15.593]  I don't want to sound like I'm fawning.
[03:09:15.593 --> 03:09:17.094]  You know, my gut told me Trump was good.
[03:09:17.094 --> 03:09:24.098]  I was supporting him long before we got contacted by Roger Stone about having him on.
[03:09:24.098 --> 03:09:36.787]  And I don't want to say I'm guilty, because I look for reasons to get mad at Trump, and there's just so few and far between, and he's so polar opposite of Hillary and the globalists, that I'm going to take four or five phone calls.
[03:09:36.787 --> 03:09:41.730]  I'm going to let David take over, but briefly, I'm going to David right now, and then I'm going to come back to you in about five minutes, but I'm going to take these calls.
[03:09:42.935 --> 03:09:46.658]  I know that you, for the first year of my support, still didn't like Trump.
[03:09:46.658 --> 03:09:50.301]  You didn't know it was a big field of people still, down to like 8 or so, from like, you know, 16.
[03:09:50.301 --> 03:09:53.905]  Because, you know, this campaign started a year and a half before the election.
[03:09:54.724 --> 03:09:56.925]  And again, I don't tell you what to think, I don't tell you what to do.
[03:09:56.925 --> 03:10:02.907]  I encourage everybody, you know, whoever they were, you know, I've told people, I said, if you want to, you know, find something about Trump you don't like, go ahead.
[03:10:02.907 --> 03:10:05.167]  I was like, really, you're finding something really bad there?
[03:10:05.167 --> 03:10:07.108]  Because the New World Order is genuinely mad.
[03:10:07.108 --> 03:10:07.868]  This isn't fake.
[03:10:07.868 --> 03:10:12.570]  And, you know, the word I've got is, you know, that he's a sleeper cell for the Liberty Movement.
[03:10:12.570 --> 03:10:15.250]  Now, though, it's so good.
[03:10:15.250 --> 03:10:16.171]  It's so bonafide.
[03:10:16.171 --> 03:10:20.052]  It's already having such devastating effects to globalists everywhere.
[03:10:21.206 --> 03:10:24.908]  That it's like we're already halfway through the antibiotics and the sore throat's gone.
[03:10:24.908 --> 03:10:28.230]  We know that this antibiotic, Donald Trump, works on the New World Order.
[03:10:28.230 --> 03:10:29.471]  We got half a bottle to go.
[03:10:29.471 --> 03:10:32.253]  Doesn't mean the antibiotic's perfect, but it's working.
[03:10:32.253 --> 03:10:33.753]  It's real.
[03:10:33.753 --> 03:10:38.276]  Now, I'm almost like in awe that our beachhead is already expanding.
[03:10:38.276 --> 03:10:39.797]  Poland's pulling out.
[03:10:39.797 --> 03:10:41.478]  Le Pen's winning.
[03:10:41.478 --> 03:10:42.699]  Gert Wilders is winning.
[03:10:42.699 --> 03:10:43.579]  They're in full retreat.
[03:10:43.579 --> 03:10:45.220]  Then I think, are they going to start a war?
[03:10:45.220 --> 03:10:45.821]  Set a nuke off?
[03:10:45.821 --> 03:10:46.941]  Because these people never give up.
[03:10:46.941 --> 03:10:49.703]  And that's why I'm not somebody looking for authoritarianism.
[03:10:51.508 --> 03:10:58.470]  They're the ones pushing authoritarianism and killing Trump and bullying us and ending free press and shutting off our advertising.
[03:10:58.470 --> 03:11:02.951]  I don't look for fights, but we're already under physical and corporate attack.
[03:11:02.951 --> 03:11:06.831]  This is sedition being organized by foreign powers.
[03:11:06.831 --> 03:11:11.973]  First off, your transformation into Trump supporter, now where are you, David?
[03:11:11.973 --> 03:11:18.314]  And then expanding from there, I just feel like we shouldn't be bullied into not having
[03:11:20.952 --> 03:11:32.476]  Let's say political force movements, at least on the leaders of these people, that have openly been in sedition, criminal fomenting, criminal architecture, clear criminal operations that are in the WikiLeaks.
[03:11:32.476 --> 03:11:38.238]  Justice says, even though nobody else will say this because we know they're a cornered rat, I'll say it, that Hillary needs to be indicted.
[03:11:38.238 --> 03:11:39.778]  George Soros, I mean, they hate me.
[03:11:39.778 --> 03:11:41.079]  They have their own publications.
[03:11:41.079 --> 03:11:46.561]  Let's just say, I'm not bragging, but they attack me as much as Trump and the actual enemy publications like Media Matters.
[03:11:47.521 --> 03:11:50.864]  They're trying to formulate all sorts of stuff to bring us down that I'll talk about soon.
[03:11:50.864 --> 03:11:55.428]  I mean, if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one.
[03:11:55.428 --> 03:11:58.270]  And so, what is the movement towards that that I'm going to call?
[03:11:58.270 --> 03:12:00.832]  And we'll skip this break so you have more time, but callers, I promise.
[03:12:00.832 --> 03:12:04.115]  Janine and Tim and Don and Jordan and Hayden, I'm coming to you, and then that's it.
[03:12:04.115 --> 03:12:06.017]  But, I mean, David, just a quick two-minute response.
[03:12:06.837 --> 03:12:12.340]  Well, you know, Alex, like you said, I was reluctant to do it because I'm very cynical about politicians.
[03:12:12.340 --> 03:12:16.462]  And even though Donald Trump was saying some things that I agreed with, he also said some things I disagreed with.
[03:12:16.462 --> 03:12:23.306]  And I didn't really trust him on the issues of fighting globalism, talking about the border, talking about trade and other issues like that.
[03:12:23.986 --> 03:12:31.955]  At one point, I realized, hey, he was running ads 20, 30 years ago at his own expense in the New York Times when he wasn't running for office.
[03:12:31.955 --> 03:12:34.558]  So this guy is genuine on this stuff, and he is genuine.
[03:12:34.558 --> 03:12:35.559]  I've seen it now.
[03:12:35.559 --> 03:12:37.321]  And we've seen him pull back TPP.
[03:12:37.321 --> 03:12:38.863]  I never thought we would get this place.
[03:12:38.863 --> 03:12:39.544]  He killed it!
[03:12:39.544 --> 03:12:40.505]  Yeah, he killed it.
[03:12:40.505 --> 03:12:41.887]  He didn't take control of it!
[03:12:42.808 --> 03:12:43.689]  That's right.
[03:12:43.689 --> 03:12:44.189]  That's right.
[03:13:01.661 --> 03:13:02.361]  That's right.
[03:13:02.361 --> 03:13:03.141]  Here's the issue.
[03:13:03.141 --> 03:13:09.603]  What we have to do, and people who disagree with him on some liberty issues, I disagree with the fact that he thinks he can still win the war on drugs.
[03:13:09.603 --> 03:13:10.404]  I don't think it can be won.
[03:13:10.404 --> 03:13:11.064]  Ridiculous.
[03:13:11.064 --> 03:13:18.406]  But yeah, but we have to understand that, as I've said over and over again, we have to see that the fight for liberty is going to be won at the local level.
[03:13:18.406 --> 03:13:20.066]  If we really want it, we're going to have to do it ourselves.
[03:13:20.066 --> 03:13:21.967]  And he's trying to devolve power back to the people.
[03:13:22.307 --> 03:13:22.647]  That's right.
[03:13:37.312 --> 03:13:38.073]  Let's be clear.
[03:13:38.073 --> 03:13:38.754]  Let's be clear.
[03:13:53.737 --> 03:13:59.904]  They admit in their public statements the EPA is meant to shut our industry down so the globalists can put it in countries with no controls.
[03:13:59.904 --> 03:14:04.029]  It's meant as internal tariffs on us to make sure we're de-industrialized.
[03:14:04.029 --> 03:14:05.270]  That's the admitted plan.
[03:14:05.270 --> 03:14:07.953]  And the globalists were so arrogant, they admitted the plan.
[03:14:07.953 --> 03:14:13.580]  The plan's out, the people have got it, their arrogance is their undoing, and when their own top people
[03:14:14.602 --> 03:14:19.624]  You know, like Malik come out now in the last decade and blow them wide open and comes on my show.
[03:14:19.624 --> 03:14:23.106]  He headed up Davos and he headed up Aspen.
[03:14:23.106 --> 03:14:24.827]  That is a huge victory!
[03:14:24.827 --> 03:14:28.988]  You know, the mission of the EPA is not clean air, clean water.
[03:14:28.988 --> 03:14:31.750]  The mission of the EPA is now climate change.
[03:14:31.750 --> 03:14:35.771]  And it has to be opposed because climate change is the problem.
[03:14:35.771 --> 03:14:37.472]  Global government is the solution.
[03:14:37.472 --> 03:14:39.813]  And remember, just a few years ago it was warming.
[03:14:39.813 --> 03:14:41.074]  We proved that a fraud.
[03:14:41.074 --> 03:14:42.494]  Now they say we disagree with change.
[03:14:42.494 --> 03:14:43.915]  No, we know change always happens.
[03:14:44.565 --> 03:14:45.326]  That's right.
[03:14:45.326 --> 03:14:52.011]  So we have to understand, that is just as key as one of the other three legs of this globalism moving forward.
[03:14:52.011 --> 03:14:55.834]  The Trans-Pacific Partnership was a key thing to stop.
[03:14:55.834 --> 03:14:58.656]  But also, climate change is very key to stop that.
[03:14:58.656 --> 03:15:02.459]  And the EPA, as I point out, climate change is what they have become about.
[03:15:02.459 --> 03:15:06.402]  And they're using illegal, unconstitutional methods to do this.
[03:15:06.402 --> 03:15:11.747]  And that's what Attorney General Pruitt is going to shut down, is that overreach from the bureaucracy.
[03:15:11.747 --> 03:15:12.067]  That's right.
[03:15:12.327 --> 03:15:13.568]  Hey Alex man, thanks for taking my call.
[03:15:13.568 --> 03:15:14.188]  Thank you brother.
[03:15:33.157 --> 03:15:39.201]  Hey man, you know my wife and I just love to watch Donald Trump and I think he's a really good speaker.
[03:15:39.201 --> 03:15:42.623]  But my wife went to bed last night and I turned on listening to Trump.
[03:15:42.623 --> 03:15:47.546]  I had to turn it off because I couldn't stand that little rat Paul Ryan back in the back.
[03:15:48.807 --> 03:15:50.068]  Yeah, let's show Trump's speech.
[03:15:50.068 --> 03:15:52.490]  The body language, the fakeness.
[03:15:52.490 --> 03:15:57.315]  If I had somebody as a dinner guest over and they acted like that, I'd say never invite that person back again.
[03:15:57.315 --> 03:16:00.438]  But not just his looks or my instinct, his action.
[03:16:00.438 --> 03:16:05.162]  Good rhetoric, but always working for the globalists, getting money from Soros.
[03:16:05.162 --> 03:16:05.843]  Please elaborate.
[03:16:05.843 --> 03:16:07.865]  What was that like?
[03:16:07.865 --> 03:16:11.108]  Well, he's the biggest obstructionist that Trump has.
[03:16:11.960 --> 03:16:20.073]  And he just looked to me like he was a monkey hanging by a string, and every time he wanted to bring attention to himself, he would stand up and clap.
[03:16:20.914 --> 03:16:22.155]  And I just had to turn it off.
[03:16:22.155 --> 03:16:23.575]  I couldn't watch it anymore.
[03:16:23.575 --> 03:16:25.256]  It was just... No, I agree.
[03:16:25.256 --> 03:16:26.697]  Paul Ryan ruined the speech for me.
[03:16:26.697 --> 03:16:30.979]  And I pretty much said that last night, but I didn't want to be a killjoy.
[03:16:30.979 --> 03:16:34.741]  You know, look, he's like every other psychopath you ever run into.
[03:16:34.741 --> 03:16:36.522]  He thinks he's invincible.
[03:16:36.522 --> 03:16:37.502]  He's in his own world.
[03:16:37.502 --> 03:16:39.363]  He has no empathy.
[03:16:39.363 --> 03:16:41.925]  And he is just, he is the biggest jerk.
[03:16:42.785 --> 03:16:43.605]  I mean, he really is.
[03:16:43.605 --> 03:16:45.706]  He is the biggest enemy of this country.
[03:16:45.706 --> 03:16:46.547]  Let me tell you something.
[03:16:46.547 --> 03:16:48.367]  Pelosi doesn't know what planet she's on.
[03:16:48.367 --> 03:16:50.028]  Maxine Waters doesn't know what planet she's on.
[03:16:50.028 --> 03:16:53.049]  You know, the other Democratic leadership thinks islands float.
[03:16:53.049 --> 03:16:55.851]  I mean, they were picked because they're idiots, okay?
[03:16:55.851 --> 03:17:05.495]  The Republicans have kind of been the slimers behind the scenes, derailing the Liberty Movement forever, and he's one of the last people that Gingrich put in through that chain for the remainder.
[03:17:06.517 --> 03:17:11.063]  And they're all compromised, and he kept looking at Trump like, I'm gonna defeat him.
[03:17:11.063 --> 03:17:12.024]  I'm better than him.
[03:17:12.024 --> 03:17:16.329]  This type of twisted psychopath is like a super alpha male, but isn't an alpha.
[03:17:16.329 --> 03:17:20.915]  And he looks at a real alpha male, like Trump, and he can't stand him.
[03:17:20.915 --> 03:17:21.496]  Please elaborate.
[03:17:21.496 --> 03:17:21.936]  Go ahead, Collin.
[03:17:21.936 --> 03:17:22.357]  Go ahead, Don.
[03:17:23.687 --> 03:17:25.268]  Well, I just couldn't watch.
[03:17:25.268 --> 03:17:26.148]  I had to turn it off.
[03:17:26.148 --> 03:17:30.609]  I mean, we all know he's the biggest obstructionist that Trump has.
[03:17:30.609 --> 03:17:32.190]  Obamacare he's trying to stall.
[03:17:32.190 --> 03:17:33.590]  Tax cuts he's trying to stall.
[03:17:33.590 --> 03:17:38.092]  Which main economists say, if we don't get him quick, we're going into a frickin' depression.
[03:17:38.092 --> 03:17:40.453]  And so, if it happens, he's the number one enemy.
[03:17:40.453 --> 03:17:41.933]  Just remember that.
[03:17:41.933 --> 03:17:42.854]  Right.
[03:17:42.854 --> 03:17:44.694]  I just have one more comment, Alex.
[03:17:44.694 --> 03:17:47.135]  I have a new name for Oprah Winfrey.
[03:17:47.135 --> 03:17:48.376]  I call her Oprah Windbag.
[03:17:50.903 --> 03:17:53.325]  She's just the biggest piece of crap on TV.
[03:18:04.932 --> 03:18:08.115]  Yeah, you know, Alex, you know how many times I've talked about Paul Ryan.
[03:18:08.115 --> 03:18:11.918]  I called him Paul Ryan-o because he is Republican in name only.
[03:18:11.918 --> 03:18:15.080]  I was really surprised, though, and here's one thing.
[03:18:15.080 --> 03:18:21.085]  This border-adjusted tax that was being pushed by the House, at first I looked at this as like, I'm just going to pass this thing back.
[03:18:21.085 --> 03:18:21.365]  No, I agree.
[03:18:21.365 --> 03:18:22.626]  Ryan, at least tacitly, is supporting something good.
[03:18:22.626 --> 03:18:26.890]  You're going to tell us at the bottom of the hour about that, but this is a good plan.
[03:18:27.330 --> 03:18:33.152]  And I agree with you, and you know, when we look at situations, look at, we had Robert Kennedy Jr.
[03:18:33.152 --> 03:18:42.795]  who came out, and he disagrees with Trump on everything, but he's honest enough to say, hey, on vaccines, and you know, mercury in the vaccines, and on what pharmaceuticals are doing to people, I'm with you.
[03:18:43.115 --> 03:18:45.336]  I'll work with you on that one issue where I agree with you.
[03:18:45.336 --> 03:18:49.297]  We need to be adult enough that if somebody comes up with a plan... No, no, I totally agree!
[03:18:49.297 --> 03:18:51.857]  I'm saying... Most Democrats don't give me the willies, okay?
[03:18:51.857 --> 03:18:52.978]  Most Republicans don't.
[03:18:52.978 --> 03:18:54.638]  Like you, I feel confident when I'm around you.
[03:18:54.638 --> 03:18:55.818]  I have no anxiety.
[03:18:55.818 --> 03:19:01.440]  I feel like I could leave you with my kids for a year and they'd be great when I came back.
[03:19:01.440 --> 03:19:03.300]  With Ryan, I get the heebie-jeebies.
[03:19:03.300 --> 03:19:04.501]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[03:19:04.501 --> 03:19:06.261]  I get the heebie-jeebies with Hillary.
[03:19:06.261 --> 03:19:07.161]  I get them with him.
[03:19:07.161 --> 03:19:09.082]  So my gut gives me the heebie-jeebies.
[03:19:09.892 --> 03:19:11.474]  Do you need the heebie-jeebies?
[03:19:30.695 --> 03:19:33.398]  Walter Jones, who's got total integrity.
[03:19:33.398 --> 03:19:35.960]  It doesn't need to be some power-grasping pretty boy.
[03:19:35.960 --> 03:19:36.561]  All right.
[03:19:36.561 --> 03:19:37.501]  Thank you, caller.
[03:19:37.501 --> 03:19:38.803]  Thank you so much.
[03:19:38.803 --> 03:19:40.504]  Up next is Jeanine in Kansas.
[03:19:40.504 --> 03:19:41.245]  You're on the air.
[03:19:41.245 --> 03:19:42.566]  Or Arkansas, excuse me.
[03:19:42.566 --> 03:19:43.107]  Our Kansas.
[03:19:43.107 --> 03:19:43.727]  You're on the air.
[03:19:43.727 --> 03:19:45.629]  Hey, Alex.
[03:19:45.629 --> 03:19:46.530]  Welcome.
[03:19:46.530 --> 03:19:47.290]  Can you hear me?
[03:19:47.290 --> 03:19:47.891]  Thank you.
[03:19:47.891 --> 03:19:48.712]  Hi.
[03:19:48.712 --> 03:19:50.894]  I never thought I'd hear your voice over the phone.
[03:19:50.894 --> 03:19:52.135]  Well, it's good to be talking to you.
[03:19:52.725 --> 03:19:53.366]  Yeah!
[03:19:53.366 --> 03:19:54.987]  Well, you're my daily food.
[03:19:54.987 --> 03:19:57.889]  That's what I told the guy who asked me who I am.
[03:19:57.889 --> 03:19:59.470]  I said, Alex is my daily food.
[03:19:59.470 --> 03:20:00.251]  Well, thank you.
[03:20:00.251 --> 03:20:02.412]  I'm flattered.
[03:20:02.412 --> 03:20:08.017]  You know, I'm a bit older than you, but years ago, I knew.
[03:20:08.017 --> 03:20:12.560]  When I was just, you know, 12, 13, 14, 15, I knew there were lies.
[03:20:12.560 --> 03:20:15.502]  I'm like, I don't know what they are, but I know they're lying.
[03:20:15.502 --> 03:20:18.565]  You picked up that the mainstream media was your enemy.
[03:20:18.565 --> 03:20:21.127]  Well, and I used to tell my mom, why can't you see it?
[03:20:21.127 --> 03:20:21.547]  Why don't you?
[03:20:21.963 --> 03:20:23.824]  You know, why don't you see this?
[03:20:23.824 --> 03:20:25.044]  You know, it took me a long time.
[03:20:25.044 --> 03:20:28.226]  I ended up having a family and this and that, but it took me a long time.
[03:20:28.226 --> 03:20:31.727]  And the books that you talk about, people can get them.
[03:20:31.727 --> 03:20:35.589]  They can read it and find all the same stuff that you know.
[03:20:35.589 --> 03:20:40.111]  I mean, you obviously know a lot more because you've dedicated your life to doing it.
[03:20:40.111 --> 03:20:41.772]  And I'm so thankful.
[03:20:41.772 --> 03:20:45.534]  You're like the Ezekiel Watchman, who calls... Well, enough about me.
[03:20:45.534 --> 03:20:46.434]  You're awesome, though.
[03:20:46.434 --> 03:20:47.875]  What's your take on the speech last night?
[03:20:47.875 --> 03:20:48.995]  You are, too.
[03:20:48.995 --> 03:20:49.435]  I know.
[03:20:49.435 --> 03:20:50.456]  One, I just wanted to say,
[03:20:51.238 --> 03:20:58.762]  You know, when you play the music, Mike and the Mechanics, you know, and you were playing Triumvirate.
[03:20:58.762 --> 03:21:02.744]  I didn't think anybody else on this earth knew about them, you know?
[03:21:02.744 --> 03:21:03.525]  I love your music.
[03:21:03.525 --> 03:21:04.405]  It connects.
[03:21:04.405 --> 03:21:07.507]  You connect, and you're doing the same.
[03:21:07.507 --> 03:21:08.988]  Hand language is Trump, and it's like,
[03:21:09.904 --> 03:21:10.745]  Like mine, you know?
[03:21:25.625 --> 03:21:30.949]  Some TV show just popped on.
[03:21:30.949 --> 03:21:32.270]  I guess something just popped on a video.
[03:21:32.270 --> 03:21:33.411]  I got all these studios.
[03:21:33.411 --> 03:21:34.291]  It's all crazy.
[03:21:34.291 --> 03:21:35.913]  Anyways, I'm like this, but everybody does that.
[03:21:35.913 --> 03:21:37.033]  He's like, hey, we're, you know, we're getting it done.
[03:21:37.033 --> 03:21:37.994]  Everything's okay.
[03:21:37.994 --> 03:21:39.435]  They claim that's Illuminati or whatever.
[03:21:39.435 --> 03:21:41.417]  These are just natural hand signs I've ever done.
[03:21:41.417 --> 03:21:43.198]  I have goodwill towards people.
[03:21:43.198 --> 03:21:49.703]  So, you know, if, you know, if, if doing hand signs like that is Illuminati, then I guess I am, but I'm not.
[03:21:49.703 --> 03:21:51.785]  Um, but I'm sorry, man, go ahead.
[03:21:52.833 --> 03:21:54.335]  You're the truth.
[03:21:54.335 --> 03:21:58.659]  Anybody who has the courage to get up there and tell the things that you do, and I feel sorry for you.
[03:21:58.659 --> 03:22:01.462]  We're blowing up the globalist control of the individual.
[03:22:01.462 --> 03:22:02.543]  They're all about control, we're not.
[03:22:02.543 --> 03:22:03.064]  But enough about me.
[03:22:03.064 --> 03:22:04.125]  What did you think of Trump's speech?
[03:22:05.309 --> 03:22:05.929]  I loved it.
[03:22:05.929 --> 03:22:11.031]  I watched every bit of it and I like the last caller who, Don and PA, he's right.
[03:22:11.031 --> 03:22:18.173]  Paul Ryan is a... Everything you guys have said, how he looks, but his heart is just... It was amazing.
[03:22:18.173 --> 03:22:19.233]  God bless you, Janine.
[03:22:19.233 --> 03:22:19.894]  Good to hear from you.
[03:22:19.894 --> 03:22:20.874]  I appreciate you calling in.
[03:22:20.874 --> 03:22:21.834]  Alright, a few more calls.
[03:22:21.834 --> 03:22:24.435]  I'm turning this over to David Knight, who's been on the longest here.
[03:22:24.435 --> 03:22:25.795]  Tim in Illinois!
[03:22:25.795 --> 03:22:26.576]  You're on the air, sir.
[03:22:26.576 --> 03:22:28.356]  Go ahead.
[03:22:28.356 --> 03:22:28.996]  Hey, Alex.
[03:22:28.996 --> 03:22:30.157]  Can you hear me?
[03:22:30.157 --> 03:22:30.977]  Yes, I can, my friend.
[03:22:32.386 --> 03:22:36.310]  Hey, I'll tell you what, last night's speech was awesome.
[03:22:36.310 --> 03:22:40.595]  Could you feel that spirit that came through from Trump last night?
[03:22:40.595 --> 03:22:41.456]  Well, I'll say this.
[03:22:41.456 --> 03:22:48.504]  I didn't know how to put it and I thought about it for like an hour this morning and I just dropped it mentally because I couldn't get the right term.
[03:22:48.504 --> 03:22:49.125]  I tried earlier.
[03:22:50.928 --> 03:23:07.259]  As he passes each test, he's given more discernment, and gets even stronger, and spiritually, there's like an aura now, and when he walked in there, and the lighting's not even that good in the Capitol building I've been in there, he was glowing, and he looked like 10, 15 years younger.
[03:23:07.259 --> 03:23:16.585]  Separately, other crew were like, God, Trump looks like he lost 20 pounds, and looks like he's electric, and he looked so good, and then it was so powerful, never made one mistake.
[03:23:17.739 --> 03:23:20.360]  I mean nobody can do that in an hour and 20 minute speech.
[03:23:20.360 --> 03:23:27.323]  I mean it's just he is overtaken by it and you know the media never quotes me.
[03:23:27.323 --> 03:23:33.926]  They always want to know what does Trump talk about you know with you in private conversations and I'll tell the media and they never say it but Trump talks about
[03:23:35.356 --> 03:23:43.023]  The strong spirit of America, God, how we've got to protect Christianity, and how, you know, just keep believing, keep working hard.
[03:23:43.023 --> 03:23:43.724]  I'm going to deliver.
[03:23:43.724 --> 03:23:44.405]  I'm going to do it.
[03:23:44.405 --> 03:23:50.931]  You know, I think you're going to be, you know, really impressed, at least everybody, because I know we're going to win.
[03:23:51.471 --> 03:23:52.532]  Well, I watched it last night.
[03:23:52.532 --> 03:23:54.533]  I've listened to a lot of different presidents.
[03:24:20.741 --> 03:24:26.523]  I actually teared up just listening to him last night.
[03:24:26.523 --> 03:24:46.910]  I realized what he's got ahead of him, and he's about like a lighthouse sitting on the side of a hill, and there's ships out there trying to come in, and he's trying to keep that light on for him in that storm, but he's got a lot against him.
[03:24:46.910 --> 03:24:47.891]  He's got a lot against him.
[03:24:49.150 --> 03:24:56.657]  The hate they have for him is the hate they have of free people from Brazil, to Russia, to Turkey, to Mexico, to the United States.
[03:24:56.657 --> 03:24:58.198]  They hate free, independent people.
[03:24:58.198 --> 03:25:03.083]  They hate powerful, diverse people that want their own destinies because they want monopolies.
[03:25:04.088 --> 03:25:05.569]  And that's the best analogy yet.
[03:25:05.569 --> 03:25:12.292]  Trump is a big lighthouse during a hurricane, with the ships trying to get in, and they're trying to shut that flame down.
[03:25:12.292 --> 03:25:16.515]  So they're shooting every weapon they've got, trying to blow that lighthouse up.
[03:25:16.515 --> 03:25:22.177]  But Trump's just honored to be in this position, and that's why he's so hard to beat.
[03:25:22.177 --> 03:25:24.579]  But I just see people that hate him, that aren't part of the system.
[03:25:25.179 --> 03:25:25.940]  Well, and one more thing, Alex.
[03:25:25.940 --> 03:25:27.601]  Watching them Democrats last night broke my heart.
[03:25:27.601 --> 03:25:29.883]  How could people sell out their country like that?
[03:25:53.224 --> 03:25:54.905]  You said the key word.
[03:25:54.905 --> 03:25:55.926]  I want you to continue, Tim.
[03:25:55.926 --> 03:25:57.446]  Heart.
[03:25:57.446 --> 03:25:58.567]  You've got a heart.
[03:25:58.567 --> 03:25:59.487]  You've got a conscience.
[03:25:59.487 --> 03:26:01.268]  You've got empathy.
[03:26:01.268 --> 03:26:02.689]  See, they don't have that, a lot of them.
[03:26:02.689 --> 03:26:06.490]  They're a bunch of selfish dirtbags who are on power trips.
[03:26:06.490 --> 03:26:07.071]  They're not humble.
[03:26:08.121 --> 03:26:16.463]  And anybody that's got a view of the world and has any real consciousness is humble, because you realize how big the universe is, and you feel God's Spirit, it makes you feel humble.
[03:26:16.463 --> 03:26:18.084]  They're not in God's Spirit.
[03:26:18.084 --> 03:26:23.705]  So the reason you said it all perfectly, better than I could ever say it, it made you sad.
[03:26:23.705 --> 03:26:26.186]  It hurt your heart.
[03:26:26.186 --> 03:26:27.286]  Because you have a heart.
[03:26:27.286 --> 03:26:30.487]  To see their fallen state made it hurt your heart.
[03:26:30.487 --> 03:26:34.188]  And they're so fallen, they want to bring us down so they have company.
[03:26:34.188 --> 03:26:34.848]  Go ahead and say more.
[03:26:36.600 --> 03:26:53.228]  I'm about an hour from where Ryan lived, here in the heartland, and it's a disgrace what them people said about her.
[03:26:53.228 --> 03:26:54.508]  I mean, it breaks my heart.
[03:26:54.508 --> 03:27:03.872]  It sickens me that people in the country are so zero empathy.
[03:27:03.872 --> 03:27:05.053]  You know, there's zero empathy.
[03:27:06.601 --> 03:27:09.963]  You're talking about Mrs. Owens who lost her husband, William Ryan.
[03:27:09.963 --> 03:27:14.345]  The nastiness, the demonization, the attacks of something so pure and wholesome.
[03:27:14.345 --> 03:27:19.028]  Again, they hate that humanity because they don't have that strength of the sacrifice.
[03:27:20.031 --> 03:27:21.092]  Alex, can I comment on that?
[03:27:21.092 --> 03:27:22.413]  Yes, David, please.
[03:27:22.413 --> 03:27:42.129]  You know, when I saw this speech last night, my first impression was I didn't like it as much as the inauguration speech, because in the inauguration speech he came out with a confrontational agenda, and I was hoping that last night it was going to be more of the same, and he's going to say, and these are the programs, and here's the details of what we're going to do, but it was really more of a conciliatory speech, and at first I thought,
[03:27:42.469 --> 03:27:46.433]  He kept looking at the Democrats saying, please stop obstructing progress.
[03:27:46.433 --> 03:27:47.774]  I really want to help you.
[03:27:47.774 --> 03:27:49.275]  He doesn't want to dominate them.
[03:27:49.275 --> 03:27:50.776]  He wants them to stop being evil.
[03:27:50.776 --> 03:27:51.297]  That's right.
[03:27:51.297 --> 03:27:56.761]  And as the caller pointed it out, when you see the Democrats sit there, when Donald Trump comes out and says, let's vote together.
[03:27:56.761 --> 03:27:59.984]  When he would look at him, he looked at him like he felt sorry for him, but it was genuine.
[03:27:59.984 --> 03:28:00.344]  Exactly.
[03:28:00.344 --> 03:28:00.625]  I'm sorry.
[03:28:00.625 --> 03:28:01.525]  Go ahead, David.
[03:28:01.525 --> 03:28:04.308]  And he says, let's work together for the good of the country.
[03:28:04.668 --> 03:28:04.828]  I'm good.
[03:28:20.896 --> 03:28:26.979]  He was booed, and it's like, wow, these people are showing themselves to be the enemy of the American people.
[03:28:26.979 --> 03:28:33.361]  He is showing himself to try, come on, let's get together, let's work for the American people, and they hate that, and it was brilliant to do that.
[03:28:33.361 --> 03:28:39.064]  That's why he's president, that's why I'm not president, because I wouldn't come out there with a policy wonk speech and say we're going to do this, this, and this.
[03:28:39.064 --> 03:28:42.986]  He worked at it at a much higher level in terms of showing where they were, yeah.
[03:28:42.986 --> 03:28:44.326]  I've never seen anything like this.
[03:28:46.007 --> 03:28:47.568]  I want to say this in closing.
[03:28:47.568 --> 03:28:53.411]  God always gives a chance like Jonah and Nineveh for a reprieve before really bad stuff.
[03:28:53.411 --> 03:28:55.493]  Or Israel would get warnings.
[03:28:55.493 --> 03:28:56.533]  Trump's that warning.
[03:28:56.533 --> 03:28:57.894]  There's no doubt he's the real deal now.
[03:28:57.894 --> 03:28:59.095]  He's not perfect.
[03:28:59.095 --> 03:29:01.136]  But there's no doubt he's already done irrevocable damage.
[03:29:01.136 --> 03:29:02.377]  You've done damage, folks.
[03:29:02.377 --> 03:29:04.518]  This is an incredible time.
[03:29:04.518 --> 03:29:06.880]  But this is our last chance.
[03:29:06.880 --> 03:29:07.880]  And we're going to have tribulation.
[03:29:07.880 --> 03:29:11.502]  We're going to have a really bad battle with the AI.
[03:29:11.502 --> 03:29:13.744]  We've got hard times ahead in the future, the next few decades.
[03:29:15.182 --> 03:29:17.183]  The promised land is past that.
[03:29:17.183 --> 03:29:21.405]  And so, God's trying to give us a shortcut, an easier way, it's still gonna be hard.
[03:29:21.405 --> 03:29:23.546]  If we don't take this now, we're gonna lose it all.
[03:29:23.546 --> 03:29:26.187]  Tim, I appreciate you, God bless you, and I can feel your spirit, and I love you.
[03:29:26.187 --> 03:29:28.068]  Okay, Tim?
[03:29:28.068 --> 03:29:28.668]  Amen, brother.
[03:29:29.517 --> 03:29:31.198]  You can tell that's a good man, a strong man.
[03:29:31.198 --> 03:29:32.258]  He can see it.
[03:29:32.258 --> 03:29:33.019]  And we have the sermon.
[03:29:33.019 --> 03:29:33.659]  It's so painful.
[03:29:33.659 --> 03:29:34.960]  I'm going to keep coming back.
[03:29:34.960 --> 03:29:37.801]  I'm going to come back and talk to Dave for a minute and turn this over to him.
[03:29:37.801 --> 03:29:39.862]  And if anybody wants to go another hour, he's welcome to.
[03:29:39.862 --> 03:29:45.765]  I know he's over there in the TV side studio, but I wanted to get him over there because that's a better studio.
[03:29:45.765 --> 03:29:46.465]  All right.
[03:29:46.465 --> 03:29:47.966]  We'll be right back on Alex Jones.
[03:29:47.966 --> 03:29:49.707]  We're changing the world together.
[03:29:49.707 --> 03:29:51.087]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.087 --> 03:29:53.629]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.629 --> 03:29:56.310]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.447 --> 03:30:06.890]  If you think that chicken sandwich you ordered at Subway did not fully taste like foul, you may have been right.
[03:30:06.890 --> 03:30:10.012]  Ashley Beckford here for InfoWars.com.
[03:30:10.012 --> 03:30:15.255]  A DNA test shows Subway's oven-roasted chicken is only 50% chicken.
[03:30:15.255 --> 03:30:17.396]  Well, this is out of CBS LA.
[03:30:17.396 --> 03:30:25.400]  According to a Canadian study, a DNA test showed only half of Subway's oven-roasted patty is made with real chicken.
[03:30:25.700 --> 03:30:32.308]  Subway was among five fast food restaurants whose chicken the Canadian Broadcast Corporation had tested.
[03:30:32.308 --> 03:30:38.054]  The Subway sandwich chain has refuted the results of the DNA test in a release statement.
[03:30:38.054 --> 03:30:42.980]  In case you're wondering what the heck was in the rest of those patties and chicken strips, it's soy.
[03:30:43.320 --> 03:30:50.023]  Multiple studies have shown eating soy products can cause males to develop gynecomastia.
[03:30:50.023 --> 03:30:52.364]  That's right guys, male breasts.
[03:30:52.364 --> 03:30:53.784]  And summer's coming.

[03:31:00.034 --> 03:31:01.915]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:31:01.915 --> 03:31:03.955]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:31:03.955 --> 03:31:06.856]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:31:06.856 --> 03:31:12.918]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:12.918 --> 03:31:22.101]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:31:22.101 --> 03:31:26.962]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.

[03:31:29.627 --> 03:31:37.682]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:37.682 --> 03:31:38.664]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:39.839 --> 03:31:43.223]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:43.223 --> 03:31:47.367]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:47.367 --> 03:31:54.075]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[03:32:08.374 --> 03:32:10.915]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[03:32:10.915 --> 03:32:16.717]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[03:32:16.717 --> 03:32:22.439]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[03:32:22.859 --> 03:32:25.822]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[03:32:25.822 --> 03:32:31.388]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[03:32:31.388 --> 03:32:38.415]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[03:32:38.415 --> 03:32:42.980]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.

[03:33:38.333 --> 03:33:44.336]  Democrats boot Trump proposal to give a voice to victims of immigrant crime.
[03:33:44.336 --> 03:33:47.178]  But before I go any further, again, thank you all for the support.

[03:35:29.824 --> 03:35:31.766]  I know I had a bunch of clips here I wanted to get to.
[03:35:31.766 --> 03:35:32.707]  I never played the clip.
[03:35:32.707 --> 03:35:34.528]  Maybe we have time on the nightly news they can do it.
[03:35:34.528 --> 03:35:39.692]  At the end of his speech about shared destiny coming together, what great unity and policies
[03:35:40.673 --> 03:35:42.614]  We must support the victims of crime.
[03:36:06.085 --> 03:36:12.949]  I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims.
[03:36:12.949 --> 03:36:14.970]  The office is called VOICE.
[03:36:14.970 --> 03:36:18.992]  Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.
[03:36:18.992 --> 03:36:26.616]  We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests.
[03:36:26.616 --> 03:36:27.137]  Joining us
[03:36:33.593 --> 03:36:34.994]  So, you heard the booth.
[03:36:34.994 --> 03:36:35.675]  They admitted they'd booed.
[03:36:35.675 --> 03:36:37.637]  They went and bitched on TV after it.
[03:36:37.637 --> 03:36:40.099]  You've got rape awareness groups.
[03:36:40.099 --> 03:36:42.001]  You've got child abuse awareness groups.
[03:36:42.001 --> 03:36:44.964]  You've got groups that are, you know, about poaching.
[03:36:44.964 --> 03:36:51.450]  You've got organizations of things we face as communities where victims come together and where people organize against the abuse.
[03:36:51.450 --> 03:36:54.193]  You have civil rights movement about the abuse of minorities.
[03:36:54.193 --> 03:36:54.853]  Good.
[03:36:54.853 --> 03:36:55.314]  I support it.
[03:36:56.465 --> 03:36:58.507]  My family on both sides support it.
[03:36:58.507 --> 03:37:00.169]  But it wasn't safe to support it.
[03:37:00.169 --> 03:37:03.993]  So I don't have to sit here and kiss the butt of these people that want to claim I'm racist because I'm white.
[03:37:03.993 --> 03:37:07.917]  No, you're racist for saying that.
[03:37:07.917 --> 03:37:08.918]  But expanding on that.
[03:37:10.418 --> 03:37:20.906]  Coming out and booing, saying that the victims of immigrant crime, folks, the worst of the worst, statistically, a very small number, but still, statistically, flee here, flee justice.
[03:37:20.906 --> 03:37:27.691]  It's like saying a bunch of Americans run to Mexico, which happens, who are bank robbers, murderers, child molesters, and then Mexico says, we're not going to do anything about them.
[03:37:27.691 --> 03:37:32.234]  If Mexico catches you down there doing it, they'll kill your ass.
[03:37:32.234 --> 03:37:37.558]  But there's this idea of political correctness that, like the railway killer, was 20-something people he killed?
[03:37:39.039 --> 03:37:46.444]  He's been released dozens of times, something like, I'm going from memory, 30-something times, when they knew he was a killer.
[03:37:46.444 --> 03:37:54.309]  It's this above-the-law thing, because they want to keep that flow coming of cheap labor and driving down the wages to exploit the peasants.
[03:37:55.225 --> 03:37:56.165]  Alex, can I jump in here?
[03:37:56.165 --> 03:37:56.966]  Yes.
[03:37:56.966 --> 03:38:15.992]  You know, you're talking about these sanctuary cities, and we have to remember that after Trump was elected and before he became president, we had immigrant rights groups in California say they wanted the state of California to hide the gang members that they had a list of from Trump because they didn't want them deported.
[03:38:16.232 --> 03:38:17.613]  And now we've seen these sanctuary cities.
[03:38:17.613 --> 03:38:23.557]  We saw Denver that did not turn over a convict who had a weapons charge.
[03:38:23.557 --> 03:38:23.798]  Rapist!
[03:38:23.798 --> 03:38:26.500]  He had armed robbery of a car and so forth and so on.
[03:38:26.500 --> 03:38:27.200]  They chased him.
[03:38:27.200 --> 03:38:31.103]  They let him loose and now they're after him for murder because he killed somebody.
[03:38:31.103 --> 03:38:38.889]  And then here in Austin, our sanctuary city sheriff had a short list of just three crimes that she would turn people over to ICE for.
[03:38:39.509 --> 03:38:43.490]  And then there was somebody that came along that had repeatedly molested a child.
[03:38:43.490 --> 03:38:44.430]  And that wasn't on the list.
[03:38:44.430 --> 03:38:48.111]  That wasn't on her list of crimes that she had turned somebody over to ICE for.
[03:38:48.111 --> 03:38:49.672]  See, this is where we're going.
[03:38:49.672 --> 03:38:52.832]  This is what the Democrats showed themselves as last night.
[03:38:52.832 --> 03:38:54.473]  And when that happened, I live-tweeted that out.
[03:38:54.473 --> 03:38:55.413]  I said, look at this.
[03:38:55.413 --> 03:38:59.974]  They're booing people who are victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants.
[03:38:59.974 --> 03:39:00.954]  And I said, wow.
[03:39:00.954 --> 03:39:01.735]  And that's the thing.
[03:39:01.735 --> 03:39:02.415]  You come here.
[03:39:02.415 --> 03:39:03.375]  It's a free-for-all.
[03:39:03.776 --> 03:39:05.761]  It's a free-for-all, like serial killers.
[03:39:05.761 --> 03:39:07.988]  We're always talking about Mexico because that was the biggest group.
[03:39:07.988 --> 03:39:09.593]  The biggest group is Chinese women!
[03:39:10.486 --> 03:39:10.706]  Yeah.
[03:39:10.706 --> 03:39:13.067]  They're coming here to have their babies and get everything free.
[03:39:13.067 --> 03:39:14.627]  I mean, you know, it's like, oh, you don't like Chinese people?
[03:39:14.627 --> 03:39:15.367]  Oh, give me a break.
[03:39:15.367 --> 03:39:16.548]  I'm not going to play a race card.
[03:39:16.548 --> 03:39:18.168]  You've got a Chinese adopted daughter.
[03:39:18.168 --> 03:39:19.648]  My sister's adopted Korean.
[03:39:19.648 --> 03:39:20.849]  I love Asians.
[03:39:20.849 --> 03:39:24.570]  I don't love people coming here and I don't get to have my babies for free.
[03:39:24.570 --> 03:39:26.270]  Nobody's paying for my babies.
[03:39:26.270 --> 03:39:28.271]  They're doing it because they want anchor babies.
[03:39:28.271 --> 03:39:32.352]  They want to be able to enjoy all the benefits of the welfare state.
[03:39:32.352 --> 03:39:33.972]  The welfare state is the magnet here.
[03:39:34.332 --> 03:39:34.512]  That's
[03:39:51.510 --> 03:39:52.451]  17-year-old anchor babies?
[03:40:12.634 --> 03:40:19.359]  And if they've got hepatitis, if they've got MRSA, if they've got the plague, if they've got leprosy popping up everywhere.
[03:40:19.359 --> 03:40:21.400]  And by the way, it's an exercise of government.
[03:40:21.400 --> 03:40:24.902]  California and other states... I used to get told this three or four years ago.
[03:40:24.902 --> 03:40:25.903]  We got leprosy in Miami.
[03:40:25.903 --> 03:40:27.104]  We got leprosy in LA.
[03:40:27.104 --> 03:40:30.206]  And I was getting this from health department people that were sending me stuff.
[03:40:30.206 --> 03:40:32.367]  And they came on the show with their faces blurred out.
[03:40:32.367 --> 03:40:33.548]  It's in the news now!
[03:40:33.548 --> 03:40:36.750]  Okay, 30 kids got leprosy in LA in one school.
[03:40:36.750 --> 03:40:38.452]  We're keeping it quiet who they are.
[03:40:38.452 --> 03:40:40.173]  They're just letting leprosy spread.
[03:40:40.173 --> 03:40:41.534]  Man, that'll eat your face off!
[03:40:42.270 --> 03:40:47.413]  I mean, someone's got leprosy and they don't even treat them!
[03:40:47.413 --> 03:40:49.794]  This is like a military attack!
[03:40:49.794 --> 03:40:57.278]  The other part of it, Alex, is that these kids are coming in to get an education, and everybody says, oh, they're getting an education, that's fine, we should all pay for it.
[03:40:57.278 --> 03:41:05.183]  Their own governments won't pay for their education, so they send them here to be educated at the expense of the American taxpayers.
[03:41:05.183 --> 03:41:07.464]  What is the tax that pays for schools?
[03:41:07.904 --> 03:41:09.445]  Primarily property taxes.
[03:41:09.445 --> 03:41:11.085]  What has the American Dream been?
[03:41:11.085 --> 03:41:12.446]  It's been owning a home.
[03:41:12.446 --> 03:41:13.886]  You're not going to own a home.
[03:41:13.886 --> 03:41:27.370]  If you own a $100,000 smaller apartment, because the American Dream is being sacrificed to the Dreamers to provide them a free education in the language of their choice, and we can't do that for everybody in the world when their own governments won't do it.
[03:41:27.370 --> 03:41:27.891]  That's right.
[03:41:27.891 --> 03:41:29.251]  David, I'm going to turn this over to you.
[03:41:29.251 --> 03:41:30.231]  You can go to it if you want.
[03:41:30.231 --> 03:41:31.512]  If not, it was the last four minutes.
[03:41:31.512 --> 03:41:32.292]  You can play whatever.
[03:41:32.292 --> 03:41:34.833]  What do we have it cut down to?
[03:41:36.926 --> 03:41:38.547]  It's a minute 45 that you take over, David.
[03:41:38.547 --> 03:41:39.447]  Great job.
[03:41:39.447 --> 03:41:40.948]  And again, I'm going to try to get more crew in here.
[03:41:40.948 --> 03:41:42.909]  We can work on the weekends, late at night.
[03:41:42.909 --> 03:41:48.912]  I want to add more shows, but this is a sophisticated TV internet network system that even mainline TV people can't run.
[03:41:48.912 --> 03:41:50.894]  We're intending to add more shows soon.
[03:41:50.894 --> 03:41:52.414]  We're intending to add more hosts.
[03:41:52.414 --> 03:41:55.116]  We're intending to add more special reports.
[03:41:55.116 --> 03:41:57.557]  I want to get where we're going about 14, 15 hours a day live here.
[03:41:59.815 --> 03:42:01.337]  But we've got to have the funding to do it.
[03:42:01.337 --> 03:42:02.738]  So thank you all for the funding and support.
[03:42:02.738 --> 03:42:04.460]  God bless you all.
[03:42:04.460 --> 03:42:09.044]  Back to Donald Trump's speech last night and then David Knight from Austin, Texas.
[03:42:09.044 --> 03:42:13.729]  Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.
[03:42:13.729 --> 03:42:14.229]  That's right.
[03:42:14.229 --> 03:42:20.035]  Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.
[03:42:20.035 --> 03:42:20.636]  That's right.
[03:42:20.636 --> 03:42:23.619]  American footprints on distant worlds are not
[03:42:24.199 --> 03:42:26.180]  Wow.
[03:42:26.180 --> 03:42:29.482]  See, destiny.
[03:42:29.482 --> 03:42:30.222]  Believe in me.
[03:42:30.222 --> 03:42:33.364]  That's what built this.
[03:42:33.364 --> 03:42:36.625]  Don't tell me it doesn't work.
[03:42:36.625 --> 03:42:41.188]  In fact, send this clip over to Zimmerman.
[03:42:41.188 --> 03:42:46.190]  I'm going to do a whole report on this right now.
[03:42:46.190 --> 03:42:47.531]  Footprints on distant worlds.
[03:42:47.531 --> 03:42:49.332]  Yeah.
[03:42:49.332 --> 03:42:51.733]  Cures of diseases in our hands, folks.
[03:42:51.733 --> 03:42:52.834]  They say, oh, it'll never happen now.
[03:42:53.806 --> 03:42:56.688]  We're like gods compared to the technology we had 100 years ago, folks.
[03:42:56.688 --> 03:42:59.350]  Those people are like gods compared to 1,000.
[03:42:59.350 --> 03:43:01.191]  It's all ours.
[03:43:01.191 --> 03:43:03.693]  We will have made America greater than ever before.
[03:43:03.693 --> 03:43:07.555]  For all Americans, this is our vision.
[03:43:07.555 --> 03:43:08.436]  This is our mission.
[03:43:09.176 --> 03:43:11.238]  But we can only get there together.
[03:43:11.238 --> 03:43:12.238]  That's right, gotta come together.
[03:43:12.238 --> 03:43:15.741]  We are one people with one destiny.
[03:43:15.741 --> 03:43:16.081]  One destiny.
[03:43:16.081 --> 03:43:18.823]  We all bleed the same blood.
[03:43:18.823 --> 03:43:22.626]  We all salute the same great American flag.
[03:43:22.626 --> 03:43:24.247]  We have to be unified to have a culture.
[03:43:24.247 --> 03:43:27.689]  And we all are made by the same God.
[03:43:27.689 --> 03:43:29.531]  That's right, invoke God.
[03:43:29.531 --> 03:43:32.533]  We have to understand that we have to build a world for people.
[03:43:32.533 --> 03:43:34.614]  The globalists just think they're so powerful, we're all done.
[03:43:34.614 --> 03:43:35.695]  No, we're not done.
[03:43:35.695 --> 03:43:38.377]  We're not rolling over to die in Zuckerberg, Schmidt.
[03:43:39.301 --> 03:43:42.344]  And your own top people are now coming over to our side.
[03:43:42.344 --> 03:43:45.627]  Get ready to fail, because we're going to win.
[03:43:45.627 --> 03:43:47.308]  Think you'll stop 7.5 billion of us?
[03:43:47.308 --> 03:44:01.601]  When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American greatness began.
[03:44:01.601 --> 03:44:03.082]  That's why Bill Gates came out and said,
[03:44:03.983 --> 03:44:07.846]  Oh, the bioweapons are going to be released and kill everybody.
[03:44:07.846 --> 03:44:08.686]  I want to save you.
[03:44:08.686 --> 03:44:09.927]  Let me have full control.
[03:44:09.927 --> 03:44:15.171]  When he writes white paper saying, kill everybody, and then in public goes, I want to save you and hops around.
[03:44:15.171 --> 03:44:23.197]  If there's any big bioweapon attacks, you're suspect number one, Bill Know-It-All Gates.
[03:44:23.197 --> 03:44:28.721]  Ted was on the show earlier today and worked inside the New World Order, been part of the whole deal.
[03:44:28.721 --> 03:44:30.942]  Ted Malik.
[03:44:30.942 --> 03:44:32.323]  I mean, look, get ready to win.
[03:44:32.323 --> 03:44:33.104]  Go ahead, David Knight.
[03:44:34.122 --> 03:44:35.423]  Alex, you're absolutely right.
[03:44:35.423 --> 03:44:43.651]  You know, when we look at this and we look at technology and we talk about all the wonders that can happen, we also need to be aware of how this can all go south.
[03:44:43.651 --> 03:44:57.084]  As somebody who always loved technology as an engineer, it's why I became an engineer, and as I look at the different uses that technology is being put to, it's turning me into what some people call a Luddite, because the issue is this.
[03:44:57.084 --> 03:44:58.286]  Technology is just a tool.
[03:44:59.156 --> 03:45:01.218]  And it can be used for good or evil.
[03:45:01.218 --> 03:45:04.321]  The issue is, who controls that tool?
[03:45:04.321 --> 03:45:06.523]  A good person, or an evil person?
[03:45:06.523 --> 03:45:12.229]  See, when our country was created, we had people who were coming at it from a Christian point of view.
[03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:14.792]  They understood that man has a fallen nature.
[03:45:14.792 --> 03:45:18.055]  That if we were angels, we wouldn't need anybody to govern over us.
[03:45:18.055 --> 03:45:22.519]  But since we're not angels, we have to be careful about those people that we do put over us, that we do give power to.
[03:45:23.360 --> 03:45:31.783]  You know, we had a video that surfaced, I tweeted that on my Twitter account, of this Nightmare Robot from Google's Boston Dynamics.
[03:45:31.783 --> 03:45:42.848]  And what they have done is they've created this hybrid that doesn't just walk, but it's got wheels and it's also got arms so it can climb and it can use the arms to get it over certain areas.
[03:45:42.848 --> 03:45:47.850]  And they referred to it as a Nightmare Robot by their own description.
[03:45:48.731 --> 03:45:55.492]  And it so concerned the people at Google that they said we need to kind of disassociate Google with this because Google...
[03:45:56.567 --> 03:46:02.432]  Bought all the promising robotics companies a couple years ago as part of this DARPA process.
[03:46:02.432 --> 03:46:07.736]  DARPA would have these robot contests, and all the most promising companies were bought by Google all at once.
[03:46:07.736 --> 03:46:19.586]  And of course they're working with Ray Kurzweil, who has a vision of man and machine merging, of machines becoming superior to us, the artificial intelligence, the singularity, that's all the idea of Ray Kurzweil.
[03:46:19.586 --> 03:46:24.610]  We need a racism, the human race against Scythian robots, and controlled by the globalists.
[03:46:24.790 --> 03:46:26.651]  We need human racism.
[03:46:26.651 --> 03:46:28.032]  Human lives matter.
[03:46:28.032 --> 03:46:29.632]  Let's put that out there.
[03:46:29.632 --> 03:46:37.216]  Let's make sure, folks, that we have the tools to control this, because this is something that is very, very dangerous.
[03:46:37.216 --> 03:46:38.177]  And I could talk for that a while.
[03:46:38.177 --> 03:46:42.179]  Actually, I will talk about that tonight on the nightly news, but I'm not going to go into that right now.
[03:46:42.799 --> 03:46:47.241]  I want to get back to this issue of where we are in globalism and how we can win.
[03:46:47.241 --> 03:46:50.383]  Because Ted Malik being on today is very, very important.
[03:46:50.383 --> 03:46:55.905]  I talked about this three weeks ago when everybody, he was tipped as being Trump's pick for U.S.
[03:46:55.905 --> 03:46:56.545]  ambassador.
[03:46:56.545 --> 03:46:57.706]  So everybody started talking about it.
[03:46:57.706 --> 03:47:00.287]  He was getting all these interviews throughout Europe.
[03:47:00.287 --> 03:47:04.289]  He said things like, look, I was part of taking down the Soviet Union.
[03:47:04.289 --> 03:47:06.890]  There's another union that needs to be taken down right now.
[03:47:06.890 --> 03:47:07.991]  It's a veiled threat to them.
[03:47:08.471 --> 03:47:11.493]  And then they said, we don't want you as EU ambassador.
[03:47:11.493 --> 03:47:13.595]  We're going to stop you from being EU ambassador.
[03:47:13.595 --> 03:47:15.796]  He said, well, maybe you didn't realize it, but we had an election.
[03:47:15.796 --> 03:47:17.257]  You don't have anything to say about that.
[03:47:17.257 --> 03:47:25.703]  He said, Donald Trump is not going to be cowed down, and neither am I. So I hope this is someone that we get as the EU ambassador.
[03:47:25.703 --> 03:47:31.648]  Very key to have somebody who is articulate, who knows what's going on, who has been behind the scenes.
[03:47:31.648 --> 03:47:36.091]  His book, he said, behind the scenes, behind the curtain of the elite.
[03:47:36.471 --> 03:47:38.892]  This is somebody who knows exactly what it is.
[03:47:38.892 --> 03:47:40.013]  Very articulate.
[03:47:40.013 --> 03:47:45.015]  As I did a couple of videos, one of them, the title was America's Nigel Farage.
[03:47:45.015 --> 03:47:45.735]  He really is.
[03:47:45.735 --> 03:47:50.877]  He's somebody who can stand up to the globalists, who knows exactly what they're about, and can really take them down.
[03:47:50.877 --> 03:47:54.619]  Also, when he talked about Davos Man being dead, you understand, Davos Man
[03:47:55.599 --> 03:47:59.164]  is the term that they created, the globalists created.
[03:47:59.164 --> 03:48:03.950]  They tried to hide Bilderberg, but they were openly bragging about Davos.
[03:48:03.950 --> 03:48:06.874]  Sure, Davos is the next man, the transcendent man.
[03:48:06.874 --> 03:48:09.917]  Yes, and they self-identified... The arrogant technocrat that will run your life.
[03:48:09.917 --> 03:48:12.461]  Yes, they self-identified, they said, we have no country.
[03:48:12.961 --> 03:48:14.002]  We are globalists.
[03:48:14.002 --> 03:48:16.303]  We don't have any loyalty to any country.
[03:48:16.303 --> 03:48:19.624]  And so he's taking that on directly, Alex, as he talked about.
[03:48:19.624 --> 03:48:23.165]  Donald Trump is going to oppose any supranational organization.
[03:48:23.165 --> 03:48:26.267]  We need to not keep consolidating things into a world government.
[03:48:26.267 --> 03:48:27.407]  So he's going to oppose that.
[03:48:27.407 --> 03:48:28.948]  Ted Malik is a great guy.
[03:48:28.948 --> 03:48:31.269]  And we need to do what we can to try to push that.
[03:48:31.269 --> 03:48:32.690]  I never thought we would stop TPP.
[03:48:33.710 --> 03:48:37.492]  And we got the awareness out there, and of course, without Donald Trump, we wouldn't have stopped it.
[03:48:37.492 --> 03:48:44.135]  I mean, the only person who was pushing for that other than Donald Trump was Bernie Sanders, and he wasn't doing it for the same reasons.
[03:48:44.135 --> 03:48:46.696]  Bernie Sanders is not worried about world government.
[03:48:46.696 --> 03:48:50.297]  But I would have supported Bernie Sanders if he had won, if he was fighting the TPP.
[03:48:50.297 --> 03:48:55.519]  I would have supported him on that issue, even though he wanted to stop it for different reasons than I wanted to stop it for.
[03:48:55.519 --> 03:48:59.581]  He only saw the danger of the threat that it posed to American workers.
[03:48:59.581 --> 03:49:00.942]  It was much broader than that.
[03:49:01.542 --> 03:49:04.124]  And he didn't want to talk about that, he didn't want to talk about the global issues.
[03:49:04.124 --> 03:49:07.526]  But we have to get together, we have to work, and we have to push on this.
[03:49:07.526 --> 03:49:14.410]  And I think we need to push back on this, because there's been a lot of pushback, even within the Trump administration, on Ted Malik.
[03:49:14.410 --> 03:49:20.494]  Because there's people within the Trump administration that are soft on this whole issue, so that's very key.
[03:49:20.494 --> 03:49:24.517]  Then on the other hand, when we look at this, and I say like I would have supported Bernie Sanders,
[03:49:25.197 --> 03:49:25.357]  I think?
[03:49:43.254 --> 03:49:44.494]  Paul Ryan, I've never trusted.
[03:49:44.494 --> 03:49:46.015]  He's lied to us over and over again.
[03:49:46.015 --> 03:49:55.637]  At first, when Donald Trump was talking about reducing the corporate income tax from 35 to 15 percent, Ryan was coming back saying, no, no, no, we're not going to go below 20 percent.
[03:49:55.637 --> 03:49:57.898]  But then they came back with this border adjustment.
[03:49:57.898 --> 03:50:03.919]  They said, all right, we'll drop it to 20 percent, but for goods that are coming into the country, we'll add an additional 20 percent.
[03:50:03.919 --> 03:50:07.840]  So then those taxes would be at 40 percent instead of the 35 that's there.
[03:50:07.840 --> 03:50:09.701]  It's not a big deal.
[03:50:10.301 --> 03:50:12.563]  Oppressive change in terms of the tax system.
[03:50:12.563 --> 03:50:14.844]  But here's the key thing that they're talking about.
[03:50:14.844 --> 03:50:20.248]  And that is taking the tax on goods that we export down to zero.
[03:50:20.248 --> 03:50:22.629]  You understand how they have rigged the playing field.
[03:50:22.629 --> 03:50:26.412]  You have to understand this because this is the key.
[03:50:26.412 --> 03:50:29.013]  The EU has zero tax on the export.
[03:50:29.013 --> 03:50:29.574]  What's that?
[03:50:29.574 --> 03:50:31.315]  The EU has zero tax on the export.
[03:50:31.315 --> 03:50:32.235]  We're doing the same thing.
[03:50:32.235 --> 03:50:33.036]  That's fair.
[03:50:33.036 --> 03:50:33.436]  Exactly.
[03:50:33.436 --> 03:50:34.737]  That's what the European government...
[03:50:35.297 --> 03:50:37.478]  That's what the European government, the EU, has been doing a long time.
[03:50:37.478 --> 03:50:39.599]  They have these large taxes internally.
[03:50:39.599 --> 03:50:44.021]  But if they send something to another country, it comes out without any of those internal taxes.
[03:50:44.021 --> 03:50:49.864]  Our goods go to compete in other markets, carrying all of the American taxes with them as a burden.
[03:50:49.864 --> 03:50:50.744]  That must stop.
[03:50:50.744 --> 03:50:52.085]  At the very least, that has to stop.
[03:50:52.085 --> 03:50:53.746]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:50:53.746 --> 03:50:58.608]  Yeah, I love that Charlie, or that Harley-Davidson thing they talked about.
[03:51:00.071 --> 03:51:08.154]  What if ExtendoVite really works, but you find that hard to believe, and you spend precious time looking for someone to say, just try it?
[03:51:08.154 --> 03:51:16.018]  I have my help today because of ExtendoVite, and if I did not take a leap of faith and try it, well, I would be on disability today.
[03:51:16.018 --> 03:51:20.820]  Take one bottle of ExtendoVite, as suggested, for 60 days to find out for yourself.
[03:51:20.820 --> 03:51:23.241]  No need to stop any other meds you may be on.
[03:51:23.241 --> 03:51:25.482]  You know by now that they are not working for you.
[03:51:25.822 --> 03:51:32.607]  Before the 60 days are up, I know that you will feel Xtend-a-Vite working for you and will want to take another bottle.
[03:51:32.607 --> 03:51:33.748]  Life is too short!

[03:53:55.966 --> 03:54:05.994]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[03:54:05.994 --> 03:54:09.177]  In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive.
[03:54:12.230 --> 03:54:13.691]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:13.691 --> 03:54:14.931]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[03:54:14.931 --> 03:54:23.856]  This last of the fourth hour, we were just talking about the border adjustment tax, the BAT, not the VAT, the value-added tax that they have in Europe.
[03:54:23.856 --> 03:54:33.041]  And of course, as we said just before we went to the break, when they have these internal taxes in Europe, they add a tax at every stage of production, and then a final sales tax.
[03:54:33.041 --> 03:54:35.022]  They call all of those a value-added tax.
[03:54:35.022 --> 03:54:38.223]  At every stage where you add a value, they add a tax.
[03:54:38.223 --> 03:54:40.845]  So it's very expensive, and they do a good job of hiding it.
[03:54:41.701 --> 03:54:45.623]  But then they remove that if they want to send it into a foreign country.
[03:54:45.623 --> 03:54:48.144]  And last night we heard Donald Trump talking about Harley-Davidson.
[03:54:48.144 --> 03:54:54.326]  He said, look, they've put a 100% tax on American motorcycles being sold in these other markets.
[03:54:54.326 --> 03:54:57.908]  They double the price to make it non-competitive.
[03:54:57.908 --> 03:55:06.932]  But then it also carries a 35% tax on everything that they sell into that market with it, because those are taxes that we put on here in America.
[03:55:07.412 --> 03:55:13.996]  You have to understand when we talk about these taxes, what has gotten us to the point of where we are.
[03:55:13.996 --> 03:55:16.057]  We all know that they've outsourced jobs.
[03:55:16.057 --> 03:55:20.539]  We all know that they've used slave labor in China in the manufacturing facilities.
[03:55:20.539 --> 03:55:25.342]  These people jumping off to the point they have to have suicide nets because of the working conditions.
[03:55:25.342 --> 03:55:29.244]  So we have these people like Walmart who have exploited this and now Walmart
[03:55:29.804 --> 03:55:30.104]  I don't know.
[03:55:51.880 --> 03:55:55.381]  And they have become multi-multi-billionaires out of doing that.
[03:55:55.381 --> 03:56:01.343]  We've got giant ships the size of a city coming from China for Walmart goods going back completely empty.
[03:56:01.343 --> 03:56:02.584]  That's a trade imbalance.
[03:56:02.584 --> 03:56:03.664]  We're all aware of that.
[03:56:03.664 --> 03:56:15.188]  But what you don't understand is how they have hobbled American workers and American businesses by putting a tax burden on anything we try to sell to somebody else.
[03:56:15.188 --> 03:56:15.629]  That is a
[03:56:16.909 --> 03:56:25.433]  A systematic penalty on American business has been put there by these globalist corporations and now they're banding together and they're running ads, where?
[03:56:25.433 --> 03:56:34.278]  On the programs that Donald Trump watches, that they know he watches Saturday Night Live, they know he watches Fox and Friends, so they put these ads there to oppose it.
[03:56:34.278 --> 03:56:42.142]  And I have to also point out, this 0% tax on exports, which has to be a component of making America great again,
[03:56:42.702 --> 03:56:46.344]  They would also put this 20% tax on imports that are coming into our country.
[03:56:46.344 --> 03:56:50.967]  And it would not just be on manufactured goods, but it would also be on services.
[03:56:50.967 --> 03:56:56.190]  All these people want to outsource jobs to India and other places because they don't want to pay American workers?
[03:56:56.190 --> 03:56:57.591]  Well, there'd be a tax on that as well.
[03:56:58.351 --> 03:57:02.474]  See, that's why it's very important, and we just saw this pivot the end of last week.
[03:57:02.474 --> 03:57:05.317]  It was an interview that Donald Trump gave to Reuters magazine.
[03:57:05.317 --> 03:57:07.379]  Earlier in the month, he said, well, I don't know.
[03:57:07.379 --> 03:57:08.800]  That seems to be very complicated.
[03:57:08.800 --> 03:57:09.580]  I don't love it.
[03:57:09.580 --> 03:57:10.501]  It's too complicated.
[03:57:10.501 --> 03:57:16.106]  He understands that the way they get around the rules is by having it very, very complicated.
[03:57:16.106 --> 03:57:19.809]  It's an old saying that it certainly applies to the income tax, for example.
[03:57:20.089 --> 03:57:24.013]  When the rules are sufficiently complex, it's the same as having no rules at all.
[03:57:24.013 --> 03:57:30.320]  These guys bury the devil in the details so many times that I understand why Donald Trump would be suspicious of it.
[03:57:30.320 --> 03:57:40.852]  I understand why he'd be suspicious of Paul Ryan, but when you look at the fundamentals of it, and of course you have to watch the details, but the fundamentals of it, putting an import tax on at the same time you drop internal taxes
[03:57:41.952 --> 03:57:50.798]  On businesses, which is going to let them hire people and expand and then take off the taxes when you're trying to export into other markets.
[03:57:50.798 --> 03:57:52.259]  That is key.
[03:57:52.259 --> 03:57:53.840]  We have to really push for that.
[03:57:53.840 --> 03:57:57.202]  We have to understand the mechanism that they're using to take that away.
[03:57:57.202 --> 03:58:05.488]  And just like we had to push for TPP, we need to push for something that if it's not exactly this tax, something that has these fundamental principles in it.
[03:58:05.488 --> 03:58:10.451]  It's very important for all of you to understand what this is and for us all to work together to push
[03:58:11.071 --> 03:58:17.376]  Trump to stand with him to move in that direction, just like it's important for us to get Ted Malik as the ambassador to the EU.
[03:58:17.376 --> 03:58:24.741]  You know, they don't require, never did require that somebody who was the ambassador to Russia had to sign on to Stalinism or to Maoism, to China, whatever.
[03:58:24.741 --> 03:58:26.482]  Didn't have to become a Muslim to go to Saudi Arabia.
[03:58:26.482 --> 03:58:29.044]  You shouldn't have to be a globalist to go to the EU.
