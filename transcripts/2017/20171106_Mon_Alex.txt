[00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:15.384]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.844 --> 00:00:17.085]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.645 --> 00:00:18.786]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:20.987]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:21.227 --> 00:00:22.367]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.908 --> 00:00:27.630]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.151]  Strap yourselves in, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:35.074]  This is going to be a rough transmission, but key to the ongoing fight against the globalists.
[00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:40.238]  It was over a month and a half ago that I said prepare for imminent SJW attacks.
[00:00:40.278 --> 00:00:43.981]  We'd already seen them saying hunt Republicans on CNN and Fox News.
[00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:46.604]  We'd already seen Congressman Scalise and others shot.
[00:00:46.964 --> 00:00:50.327]  We'd already seen city council members gunned down by their Democratic neighbors.
[00:00:50.627 --> 00:00:55.712]  We'd already seen Black Lives Matter connected groups killing police all over the nation and the knockout game.
[00:00:56.752 --> 00:01:01.136]  But now, we heard them say that their big event was coming this November 4th.
[00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:08.763]  Well, Rand Paul has a punctured lung and five broken ribs, and we've got a church with 26 dead people from an SJW atheist.
[00:01:09.103 --> 00:01:10.785]  It's all coming up, but first, this report.
[00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.554]  The former head of the DNC has come out and said Hillary stole the election from Bernie Sanders.
[00:01:18.135 --> 00:01:19.376]  I don't need to hear that from her.
[00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:20.137]  It's a fact.
[00:01:20.237 --> 00:01:26.343]  But I know she's telling the truth because what she's written about and gone public about in her new book is what happened at the time.
[00:01:26.643 --> 00:01:27.464]  It's all confirmed.
[00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:43.632]  Bigger than that, mainstream media, CNN, MSNBC, Wolf Blitzer, Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, they're all turning against the Clintons now because they know there's no way they can cover up the crimes they've committed.
[00:01:43.652 --> 00:01:51.476]  Do you think, though, that what we're learning from Donna Brazile's book suggests that the campaign, that what the Democratic National Committee did, meant this election was rigged?
[00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:52.756]  Yeah, I think it was.
[00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:55.638]  It's a pretty powerful
[00:01:56.722 --> 00:02:03.346]  Well, what we have to focus on now as Democrats is we recognize the process was rigged.
[00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:09.370]  There's sort of a shocking revelation from the former Democratic National Committee interim chair Donna Brazile.
[00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.391]  Here's what they don't know.
[00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:13.853]  They don't know what it was like to be over at the DNC during this hacking.
[00:02:14.093 --> 00:02:16.015]  They don't know what it's like to bury a child.
[00:02:16.075 --> 00:02:16.975]  I did, Seth Rich.
[00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:20.978]  They don't know what it's like to protect the staff from further harassment.
[00:02:21.238 --> 00:02:22.299]  They don't know what it's like.
[00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:27.363]  We broke first that they rigged the nomination process against Bernie Sanders.
[00:02:27.603 --> 00:02:30.105]  We've been proven correct in triplicate.
[00:02:30.465 --> 00:02:31.986]  So again, we're the real news.
[00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:34.769]  MSNBC, the rest, they're the fake news.
[00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:42.315]  We also broke that Seth Rich clearly was executed and murdered as the head staffer over the emails to the DNC.
[00:02:42.575 --> 00:02:47.339]  There were major homeland security investigations over Pakistan, India, Russia,
[00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.063]  China, the EU, NR servers, Hillary's illegal servers, they wanted to cover it up.
[00:02:53.223 --> 00:02:57.165]  Donna Brazile has now come out and said she wanted to go to Homeland Security.
[00:02:57.386 --> 00:03:03.470]  She tried to get Jay Johnson involved and Hillary and others said shut up, don't look at it, don't investigate it.
[00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.590]  Incredible.
[00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.334]  But that pales in significance to the headline at Infowars.com from her book.
[00:03:11.215 --> 00:03:16.959]  Donna Brazile says she feared for her life after Seth Rich was killed.
[00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:25.805]  And that she basically thought the DNC or others were going to try to kill her to cover up what she knew about whatever was happening in those servers.
[00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:28.887]  This is the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:32.529]  Donna Brazile is controlled by Biden, by Obama, and others.
[00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.451]  And they're trying to compartmentalize now the danger.
[00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:36.472]  But think about this.
[00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:37.733]  We got hammered.
[00:03:37.793 --> 00:03:38.494]  We got attacked.
[00:03:38.554 --> 00:03:43.301]  We got demonized for being the first to expose that Seth Rich was a political murderer.
[00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:47.907]  Then WikiLeaks came out and said, we don't normally give up sources, but basically he's our source.
[00:03:48.347 --> 00:03:52.352]  We've got a big reward for whoever finds out who killed him.
[00:03:53.473 --> 00:03:54.774]  That's why they're now so desperate.
[00:03:55.154 --> 00:04:01.797]  And the fact that the Democratic Party establishment is running from the Clintons right now shows you the whole House of Cards is coming down.
[00:04:02.377 --> 00:04:04.478]  This is Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[00:04:05.158 --> 00:04:14.243]  Former DNC pig Donna Brazile dropped a bombshell in her new book when she admitted that she feared for her life in the wake of the murder of Seth Rich.
[00:04:15.083 --> 00:04:19.307]  That means that Brazil knew that Rich had been murdered for political purposes.
[00:04:20.028 --> 00:04:29.816]  One need look only at the interview with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks where he says three times in regard to Rich that sources to WikiLeaks are in great physical danger.
[00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:35.281]  And then he posts a $25,000 reward for apprehension of Seth Rich's murderer.
[00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:37.063]  What more do you need to know?
[00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:39.265]  Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[00:04:41.132 --> 00:04:43.875]  What more do you need, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:04:43.975 --> 00:04:52.003]  Donna Brazile, the former head of the DNC, has now come out publicly and said, I fear for my life.
[00:04:52.364 --> 00:04:59.251]  Seth Rich was probably murdered politically to cover up corruption in the DNC and a bunch of foreign countries inside our servers.
[00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:00.652]  And I'm not involved.
[00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:01.873]  It's incredible.
[00:05:01.893 --> 00:05:02.354]  Stay with us.
[00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:08.789]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:16.254]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:25.220]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.663]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:05:29.903 --> 00:05:35.247]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:05:35.487 --> 00:05:39.350]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.932]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:05:43.152 --> 00:05:54.220]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.962]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[00:05:57.202 --> 00:06:03.186]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[00:06:04.707 --> 00:06:05.267]  We've got it.
[00:06:05.327 --> 00:06:11.750]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.911]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:16.211 --> 00:06:21.854]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:31.531]  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
[00:06:32.872 --> 00:06:36.575]  It's been said that you really find out what kind of people you're dealing with during a crisis.
[00:06:37.616 --> 00:06:45.201]  And every time there's a tragedy, in the state of Texas particularly, I'm really proud of how the people come together.
[00:06:46.702 --> 00:06:48.123]  Of every background.
[00:06:48.884 --> 00:06:49.765]  Like we saw in Houston.
[00:06:51.088 --> 00:07:04.216]  But we saw Charlie Hebdo, we saw Hollywood, we saw Jennifer Lawrence, we saw countless Hollywood people say, good, I hope all those rednecks die in Houston because they voted for Trump.
[00:07:05.036 --> 00:07:09.278]  Even though Houston is arguably the most diverse city in the United States.
[00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:18.604]  And Paul Watson chronicled this last night on his Twitter feed in the aftermath of the biggest mass murder in Texas history.
[00:07:20.253 --> 00:07:21.754]  I guess even worse than the tower shooting.
[00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:33.964]  And he chronicled all these prominent Democrat-Liberal Twitter accounts celebrating it, making jokes about it, despite the fact that I've looked at the videos the church put on its own YouTube and photos.
[00:07:34.384 --> 00:07:35.966]  The church was about half Hispanic.
[00:07:36.626 --> 00:07:38.928]  Just like South Texas, there isn't Hispanic or white.
[00:07:39.088 --> 00:07:41.250]  It's just everybody's married in together.
[00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.312]  And the church had a lot of Hispanic folks in it.
[00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:47.335]  And that's mainly who ended up getting killed, by the way.
[00:07:47.935 --> 00:07:58.742]  But the leftist media didn't care, they just ran with it, that, oh, see, you right-wingers in Texas who ride your horses to work, and this is a rural area, by the way, you deserve to basically die.
[00:07:59.782 --> 00:08:12.310]  Then Newsweek wrote a big story trying to spin the whole report that the shooter, disarmably discharged, Devin P. Kelly,
[00:08:13.496 --> 00:08:17.637]  from the Air Force for beating his wife and baby of a previous marriage, four years ago.
[00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:21.259]  He was in the brig for it, so it was pretty serious for a while.
[00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:23.639]  He was locked up in jail for much of a year.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.742]  We now know he was a devout atheist, an SJW, an animal rights activist, and was wearing black!
[00:08:33.723 --> 00:08:36.064]  The customary antifa festoonering.
[00:08:37.064 --> 00:08:39.445]  Now, that said,
[00:08:41.215 --> 00:08:49.680]  If you remember the shooting in South Carolina with Dylan Roof, who went in and shot all of those people.
[00:08:51.262 --> 00:08:54.584]  Yes, there was one photo of him with a Confederate flag trying to be rebellious.
[00:08:55.044 --> 00:08:56.225]  And he probably was a racist.
[00:08:56.525 --> 00:08:58.746]  And he killed nine innocent black people in cold blood.
[00:08:59.127 --> 00:09:01.508]  For months, every white person was guilty.
[00:09:02.088 --> 00:09:03.549]  Every Confederate flag was evil.
[00:09:03.589 --> 00:09:04.510]  The South was evil.
[00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.751]  The American flag was evil.
[00:09:06.071 --> 00:09:07.192]  George Washington was evil.
[00:09:07.232 --> 00:09:08.332]  Thomas Jefferson was evil.
[00:09:08.633 --> 00:09:10.474]  We all had to be collectively guilty.
[00:09:12.895 --> 00:09:20.321]  For what one idiot turned out on psychotropic drugs, a big loser, was on because there was one photo of him with a rebel flag.
[00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:35.693]  Well, we have Devin P. Kelly on his LinkedIn and on Facebook with a whole list and him putting out all of his beliefs in a fight fascism movement.
[00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.053]  And they've been trying to pull these down off of LinkedIn and off of Twitter and off of Facebook.
[00:09:41.153 --> 00:09:43.235]  We've confirmed these are his pages.
[00:09:44.095 --> 00:09:50.900]  There's some other satire pages that have, you know, made jokes or photoshopped him in with the Antifa flag that's not real.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.661]  We've tracked it back.
[00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:58.406]  And that kind of stuff just hurts the truth because then the media can point at it and say, oh, look, you know, this is all fake.
[00:10:00.051 --> 00:10:03.577]  No, ladies and gentlemen, Dylann Roof had a rebel flag and was into being a racist.
[00:10:03.957 --> 00:10:06.521]  Not that the rebel flag was racist, but for him it was.
[00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:07.323]  He made it racist.
[00:10:08.364 --> 00:10:10.507]  And Devin P. Kelly.
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.501]  was definitely a anti-christian globalist.
[00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:18.021]  Now what have I been saying for months, building up into October and November?
[00:10:18.081 --> 00:10:20.062]  I said Christian churches.
[00:10:20.782 --> 00:10:22.262]  I specifically said Baptist churches.
[00:10:22.282 --> 00:10:26.403]  We're trying to find the video right now because for some reason the globalists really hate Baptist churches.
[00:10:26.743 --> 00:10:34.185]  Baptist churches, primary schools, secondary schools, colleges, sporting events, rock concerts, country music events.
[00:10:35.572 --> 00:10:38.274]  Think of the mindset of an SJW that wants war.
[00:10:38.394 --> 00:10:41.076]  Think about their past history and think about what they're going to do.
[00:10:41.116 --> 00:10:48.881]  Because they can go out, kill a bunch of Christian conservatives, and then blame the Second Amendment all at the same time.
[00:10:50.382 --> 00:10:55.405]  Because again, they want the leftist ideology to dominate and take over the culture and the society.
[00:10:55.725 --> 00:10:57.886]  So they want guns, but they want your guns.
[00:10:58.587 --> 00:11:01.409]  And this is all the more reason for all of us
[00:11:03.137 --> 00:11:06.222]  To have our own self-defense in this country.
[00:11:07.084 --> 00:11:11.431]  Now that said, we're going to break all of that down coming up today.
[00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.797]  Then we have Trump's incredible visit.
[00:11:16.034 --> 00:11:19.677]  to Japan and now to South Korea and the tensions there.
[00:11:19.757 --> 00:11:24.040]  We have the other attacks on Christians and conservatives that happened over the weekend.
[00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:41.054]  We have Rand Paul tackled from behind by his socialist SJW neighbor, another doctor who's anti-Trump, a big globalist fan, broke five of his ribs, punctured his lung, much more serious than originally known.
[00:11:41.394 --> 00:11:43.215]  He was given a class 4 felony.
[00:11:43.255 --> 00:11:43.616]  That's like
[00:11:44.608 --> 00:11:45.950]  Walking your dog without a leash.
[00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.033]  Absolutely outrageous.
[00:11:48.073 --> 00:11:53.281]  So Paul has ribs fractures, lung contusions after apparent assault.
[00:11:54.830 --> 00:12:13.320]  By his SJW nature, a neighbor who was an avowed socialist, even though he had a house, you can see the photos, three times bigger than Rand Paul's half a million dollar house, and made a fortune selling quack rice bags that helped back pain on Home Shopping Network.
[00:12:13.621 --> 00:12:13.981]  I love it.
[00:12:14.121 --> 00:12:19.464]  Another virtue signaling socialist who's worth millions of dollars, and then assaulting Rand Paul.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.020]  Isn't that just special?
[00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:31.162]  And then, of course, the really giant news, the humongous, ultra-massive, incredibly important news that's coming up.
[00:12:32.762 --> 00:12:34.302]  Donna Brazile, we have the clips.
[00:12:35.403 --> 00:12:39.683]  I considered replacing Clinton with Biden as 2016 nominee.
[00:12:40.344 --> 00:12:47.445]  Donna Brazile, quote, go to hell, I won't shut up about Hillary stealing the nomination and Seth Rich's death.
[00:12:48.649 --> 00:12:57.533]  She called him a friend and a colleague and just keeps pointing out that he was murdered and that she was scared for her life.
[00:12:57.593 --> 00:12:59.294]  I mean, what is she telling you?
[00:12:59.334 --> 00:13:00.695]  She is one millimeter.
[00:13:01.852 --> 00:13:04.013]  From saying investigate Hillary for the murder.
[00:13:04.053 --> 00:13:05.673]  She is crying out for help.
[00:13:05.733 --> 00:13:06.713]  Who had the illegal server?
[00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:07.293]  Hillary.
[00:13:08.013 --> 00:13:18.596]  Who was involved with the Russians and told Brazil don't let the FBI and Homeland Security in the computers when they tried 22 times to get in and the DNC said no.
[00:13:19.616 --> 00:13:20.897]  You say, well why didn't they just get a warrant?
[00:13:20.977 --> 00:13:21.437]  The DNC?
[00:13:21.477 --> 00:13:22.777]  They thought Hillary was going to be president.
[00:13:24.617 --> 00:13:25.958]  She had her FBI director in.
[00:13:25.978 --> 00:13:27.438]  She had her Homeland Security head in.
[00:13:28.098 --> 00:13:31.239]  She'd been co-president with Obama, basically, running the State Department.
[00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:33.160]  And so they didn't do it.
[00:13:34.121 --> 00:13:35.982]  But now it's all imploding.
[00:13:36.022 --> 00:13:37.083]  Praise God for that.
[00:13:37.103 --> 00:13:39.285]  This is really, really amazing news.
[00:13:39.665 --> 00:13:43.048]  And she dedicated her book to the patriot, Seth Rich.
[00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:45.330]  This is big.
[00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.732]  This is rats leaving the sinking ship, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:47.752 --> 00:13:49.253]  It all, quote, broke last week.
[00:13:49.273 --> 00:13:52.556]  A lot of you were saying, wait a minute, we heard about this a year ago plus, Alex!
[00:13:53.617 --> 00:14:00.103]  I know, you get next year's news today, literally, at InfoWars.
[00:14:02.094 --> 00:14:06.075]  That's why we're under such attack because we force these issues out in the open.
[00:14:06.455 --> 00:14:07.436]  Now, I'm going to stop right there.
[00:14:09.136 --> 00:14:17.979]  We're having to end the specials and have ended the specials on Xtube and a bunch of other products for 50% off.
[00:14:18.619 --> 00:14:28.822]  But we do have new specials that are running right now on DNA Force, which has 150 plus studies we're even able to quote to you that are listed at Infowarslife.com.
[00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:31.317]  We're good to go.
[00:14:46.246 --> 00:14:53.232]  The mitochondria that detoxify the DNA, that detoxify the inner cell areas and those toxic plaques that build up.
[00:14:53.252 --> 00:15:01.139]  It has a 4.8 review, 96% on Power Reviews, unprecedented out of 1,100 reviews.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.343]  DNA Force is the equivalent of $500 and $600 other formulas that are sold by doctors
[00:15:09.372 --> 00:15:13.559]  And that people then pay three or four times what they should just done by doctors.
[00:15:13.599 --> 00:15:18.328]  We sell it for literally only a 70 to 80 percent markup.
[00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:25.035]  Not a 200, 300, 400, 500 percent markup as most nutraceuticals.
[00:15:25.055 --> 00:15:27.056]  This is nutraceutical grade.
[00:15:27.316 --> 00:15:29.277]  Some of the compounds are drugs in other countries.
[00:15:30.078 --> 00:15:30.878]  It is amazing.
[00:15:31.058 --> 00:15:32.199]  You want to detoxify.
[00:15:32.539 --> 00:15:34.641]  It's been proven to cause nerve regrowth.
[00:15:35.041 --> 00:15:36.762]  So you may have old injuries that kind of went numb.
[00:15:37.042 --> 00:15:39.363]  The scar tissue might bring some old pain back.
[00:15:39.403 --> 00:15:41.825]  I mean, it's got some good side effects as nerves come back.
[00:15:42.125 --> 00:15:43.666]  But find out, 25 percent off.
[00:15:44.086 --> 00:15:46.728]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:15:47.128 --> 00:15:47.228]  Full.
[00:16:03.951 --> 00:16:13.733]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[00:16:14.594 --> 00:16:23.956]  And today we see the leftist, the globalist, controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[00:16:24.356 --> 00:16:27.317]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[00:16:27.937 --> 00:16:37.609]  Clothing is a statement, and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud, just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[00:16:38.089 --> 00:16:43.295]  So right now, folks, we're gonna debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the InfoWars store.
[00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:46.057]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[00:16:46.117 --> 00:16:47.057]  It's a limited edition.
[00:16:47.637 --> 00:16:49.618]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[00:16:49.858 --> 00:16:56.580]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.101]  On the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[00:17:01.341 --> 00:17:02.842]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows
[00:17:03.562 --> 00:17:08.926]  That organizations like CNN are owned by foreign multinational corporations, hell-bent on enslaving this country.
[00:17:09.227 --> 00:17:13.250]  So when you expose them as fake news, you're doing your patriotic duty.
[00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:18.034]  You're exercising your First Amendment in defiance of their bullying, garbage, and tyranny.
[00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:22.597]  And on the back, Infowars.com is the standard of real news.
[00:17:23.118 --> 00:17:24.219]  And of course, this classic?
[00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:25.500]  Says it all.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:26.500]  Need I say more?
[00:17:27.001 --> 00:17:28.602]  You want to have a political message out there?
[00:17:28.642 --> 00:17:34.406]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[00:17:34.426 --> 00:17:37.829]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[00:17:38.269 --> 00:17:43.854]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[00:17:44.574 --> 00:17:46.895]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[00:17:47.216 --> 00:17:55.621]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[00:17:55.881 --> 00:17:59.443]  And this shirt, in the spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[00:18:00.283 --> 00:18:09.754]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Labe or Come and Take It in good old-fashioned English t-shirts.
[00:18:09.894 --> 00:18:12.397]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[00:18:12.758 --> 00:18:13.859]  InfoWars.com.
[00:18:13.879 --> 00:18:14.379]  Spread the word.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.221]  I designed this baby.
[00:18:16.301 --> 00:18:18.723]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[00:18:19.103 --> 00:18:23.366]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:18:23.766 --> 00:18:27.569]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[00:18:28.009 --> 00:18:30.711]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[00:18:30.731 --> 00:18:32.112]  It's been around about 19 years.
[00:18:32.752 --> 00:18:36.334]  It's the classic InfoWars tyranny response team shirt.
[00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:39.717]  And of course we've seen the NFL taking a knee.
[00:18:40.978 --> 00:18:44.221]  During the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[00:18:44.941 --> 00:18:45.822]  That's disrespectful.
[00:18:45.862 --> 00:18:49.866]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[00:18:49.926 --> 00:18:57.392]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[00:18:57.793 --> 00:18:59.234]  Our republic is in distress.
[00:18:59.714 --> 00:19:00.115]  Ask me why.
[00:19:00.835 --> 00:19:02.757]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[00:19:02.897 --> 00:19:08.402]  Good old camouflage with the Day-Glo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[00:19:08.882 --> 00:19:10.363]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[00:19:10.443 --> 00:19:13.406]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go ahead and put another shirt on.
[00:19:13.866 --> 00:19:16.048]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:18.891]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[00:19:19.551 --> 00:19:20.391]  It's all about freedom.
[00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:21.752]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[00:19:22.292 --> 00:19:23.192]  Resist Tyranny.
[00:19:23.853 --> 00:19:24.833]  Made in America.
[00:19:24.853 --> 00:19:24.833]  1776.
[00:19:25.473 --> 00:19:28.555]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[00:19:28.775 --> 00:19:29.735]  The backs are really cool.
[00:19:30.095 --> 00:19:30.775]  Look at that back.
[00:19:30.816 --> 00:19:31.716]  That is pure Americana.
[00:19:32.972 --> 00:19:34.013]  And I almost forgot.
[00:19:34.113 --> 00:19:38.136]  We've got dozens and dozens of great limited edition ball caps available.
[00:19:38.236 --> 00:19:38.936]  The Dayglo.
[00:19:39.437 --> 00:19:39.857]  Perfect.
[00:19:40.197 --> 00:19:43.500]  Now when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.321]  And this is my favorite ball cap.
[00:19:45.681 --> 00:19:47.002]  Over 20 ball caps we put out.
[00:19:47.242 --> 00:19:48.283]  It's got the nice patch.
[00:19:48.623 --> 00:19:49.664]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:49.904 --> 00:19:50.785]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[00:19:51.045 --> 00:19:54.468]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[00:19:54.888 --> 00:19:56.469]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[00:19:56.729 --> 00:19:57.730]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.493]  And check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:20:06.067 --> 00:20:08.656]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:39.306 --> 00:20:44.392]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:45.773 --> 00:20:50.758]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[00:20:50.919 --> 00:21:00.289]  Alright, before I get into the terrible tragic shooting by a atheist, bloodthirsty, dirtballed,
[00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:04.855]  And atheists are going to say, hey, don't blame all atheists for what he did.
[00:21:05.155 --> 00:21:15.962]  Well, I actually agree with you, but you blamed all white people, the left did, for one degenerate, crazy white guy that killed nine people up at a black church in South Carolina.
[00:21:16.462 --> 00:21:23.366]  So I'm just pointing out that you see that conservatives are not blaming all liberals or all atheists for this.
[00:21:23.707 --> 00:21:25.268]  But we are pointing out he was wearing black
[00:21:25.908 --> 00:21:32.911]  That was an Antifa supporter and was a big SJW and this did happen the day after the November 4th.
[00:21:33.992 --> 00:21:38.734]  He couldn't do it on November 4th because there aren't any churches that were meeting then.
[00:21:39.535 --> 00:21:41.355]  But there were on November 5th.
[00:21:42.276 --> 00:21:54.762]  Just like Rand Paul had five ribs broken and a punctured lung by his socialist neighbor who hated his guts and reportedly was a huge SJW on his own Facebook drooling over
[00:21:56.445 --> 00:21:57.646]  The violence that we've seen.
[00:21:58.346 --> 00:21:59.126]  So, there you go.
[00:21:59.146 --> 00:22:00.427]  And a lot more of this is happening.
[00:22:00.867 --> 00:22:01.387]  You see it.
[00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:05.109]  You don't see conservatives beating up Hillary supporters on the street.
[00:22:05.649 --> 00:22:17.715]  You see leftists throwing hot coffee on and punching in the face and attacking from behind and knifing the tires and knockout gaming and shooting cops because they want a violent revolution.
[00:22:19.916 --> 00:22:21.777]  Then they play dumb when we point it out.
[00:22:22.318 --> 00:22:24.879]  Now, before I get into that, I want to go over some fake news.
[00:22:26.055 --> 00:22:34.339]  Remember a few months ago, there was a little boy, partially handicapped, from the chest down, in his chair, visiting the White House.
[00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:37.741]  And Trump spent more time with him than anybody in the room combined.
[00:22:38.522 --> 00:22:40.483]  Talked to him several minutes, talked to him again later.
[00:22:41.503 --> 00:22:43.344]  Well, Trump's walking by, shaking other hands.
[00:22:43.704 --> 00:22:44.845]  The child reaches out again.
[00:22:44.925 --> 00:22:45.945]  Trump doesn't see it.
[00:22:46.626 --> 00:22:49.807]  And the media said, look, Trump ignored the child.
[00:22:50.148 --> 00:22:51.688]  What a dirty, horrible person.
[00:22:52.109 --> 00:22:54.370]  Even though, 20 seconds before in the clip,
[00:22:56.815 --> 00:22:59.455]  You see that Trump was spending time with the child.
[00:23:00.476 --> 00:23:02.816]  Well, they've done it again, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:03.556 --> 00:23:08.737]  Infowars.com story by Paul Joseph Watson, up at DrudgeReport.com, as well, the middle column.
[00:23:09.717 --> 00:23:10.157]  Triggered!
[00:23:10.397 --> 00:23:14.778]  Media goes into meltdown over Trump feeding fish in Japan.
[00:23:16.838 --> 00:23:21.999]  Now, it shows the Prime Minister, first show a little bit out, and then dump the whole thing in as well.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.440]  But the media only showed Trump doing it,
[00:23:26.676 --> 00:23:29.037]  And makes it look like Trump did it improperly.
[00:23:29.997 --> 00:23:39.640]  By the way, anybody that knows how to feed koi knows that you do dump it in.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:47.642]  So again, CNN video doesn't show that the Prime Minister threw in his whole batch as well.
[00:23:48.742 --> 00:23:55.584]  It only cuts to Trump dumping the whole thing in to again make it look like Trump is being
[00:23:56.812 --> 00:24:00.014]  buffoonish and and being a thug or being a ogre.
[00:24:02.276 --> 00:24:09.041]  So everything he does must be turned around to be a bad thing or a weird thing.
[00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:10.242]  That's the rule.
[00:24:10.602 --> 00:24:12.824]  Whatever they see they basically invert it.
[00:24:13.605 --> 00:24:17.628]  So that story is again up on Infowars.com.
[00:24:17.888 --> 00:24:25.774]  You want to see the full video versus what the CNN folks had edited and and whether it's something like
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:27.341]  Like that?
[00:24:28.605 --> 00:24:30.911]  Like what just happened with the koi fish?
[00:24:31.866 --> 00:24:51.319]  Or it's something similar to what happened when the little handicapped boy is trying to shake the president's hand after he's already spent more time with him than anybody else, and the president is busy shaking other hands and doesn't see it, and moves on, they turn that into him being a vicious, horrible person.
[00:24:51.559 --> 00:24:56.262]  And again, this is what they do on every single front, every single time.
[00:24:56.302 --> 00:24:58.364]  In fact, let's keep rolling the video for TV viewers.
[00:24:58.964 --> 00:25:01.186]  When he first came in, he did spend a lot of time with the boy.
[00:25:02.086 --> 00:25:08.650]  But then, when he's spending time shaking other hands, and the boy is reaching out, Trump is focused on them and does not go back to him.
[00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:26.939]  They do the same thing with his wife, who has impeccable etiquette, and he'll be reaching out to her in a crowd as they're supposed to be walking off a runway or whatever, and she's focused and will pull her hand away because that's not the etiquette, and they spin it that, oh, his wife hates him.
[00:25:30.202 --> 00:25:48.565]  Trump will reach his hand out to another President or First Lady or Prime Minister and they'll shake her hand first, they'll cut the video and say that it's being done because they are disrespecting the President because they don't like him.
[00:25:48.765 --> 00:25:49.066]  And look,
[00:25:50.464 --> 00:25:52.025]  I know we've got North Korea crises.
[00:25:52.585 --> 00:26:05.231]  I know we've got Antifa running around attacking Rand Paul and shooting up baseball events of senators and knockout gaming people and burning down buildings and shooting cops in the back and attacking churches.
[00:26:05.291 --> 00:26:06.811]  I know we've got a lot of serious stuff going on.
[00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:16.756]  But if you look at how they take just normal Trump etiquette, where he does a great job with world leaders, has incredible energy, incredible stamina,
[00:26:17.765 --> 00:26:21.187]  Running circles around any president in modern history.
[00:26:21.968 --> 00:26:24.849]  They take that strength and run it down.
[00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.491]  And they just keep running more and more.
[00:26:29.832 --> 00:26:35.776]  So when I defend the president, I'm not defending the president because I'm in some cult of personality.
[00:26:35.896 --> 00:26:38.557]  I'm defending the president because I'm defending reality.
[00:26:39.858 --> 00:26:44.281]  And because I realize that the social engineers
[00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.232]  are involved in an attempt to overthrow reality.
[00:26:49.252 --> 00:26:58.939]  And so I have to defend Trump because if you give in to them, they then are able to run the tables and social engineer our country and the world into oblivion.
[00:26:59.239 --> 00:27:01.781]  And again, I know as an audience, you understand that.
[00:27:02.381 --> 00:27:04.302]  We have to continue to expose the fake news.
[00:27:05.303 --> 00:27:09.425]  Newsweek and their entire corporation has laid off half their employees.
[00:27:09.846 --> 00:27:11.327]  Four years ago, they laid off a third.
[00:27:11.807 --> 00:27:14.669]  They are, what, 20% now of what they were.
[00:27:15.922 --> 00:27:16.743]  Have they gotten better?
[00:27:16.803 --> 00:27:39.180]  No, they write even more deceptive garbage and say that this guy that shot up all these people at a church killing 26, including members of his ex-wife's family, his second wife's family, they're saying there's no connections, none of it's real, it's all made up with no evidence, despite the fact the state police, the governor's office,
[00:27:40.632 --> 00:28:03.899]  The Lieutenant Governor, the Daily Mail, all of them are reporting what we reported last night, that it is his LinkedIn account, it is his Facebook account they've now removed, and indeed they've talked to his neighbors, they've talked to his classmates, they said he was a Christian-hating atheist, who'd been discharged dishonorably, that means he couldn't own guns anymore, for assaulting his first wife and child.
[00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:08.881]  A cowardly sack of garbage, wearing the Antifa black,
[00:28:10.202 --> 00:28:16.045]  Going into a church, where he knew people would be disarmed, to slaughter a bunch of people.
[00:28:16.365 --> 00:28:22.409]  Because his wife, his ex-wife, dared to go to a church, and he was going to show her who the boss was.
[00:28:23.229 --> 00:28:29.973]  Well, he came outside, and a middle-aged plumber engaged him, shot him through the body armor.
[00:28:30.493 --> 00:28:32.214]  He was reportedly bleeding when he got in his truck.
[00:28:32.554 --> 00:28:35.056]  They chased him 95 miles an hour down the road.
[00:28:37.543 --> 00:28:41.627]  And the police are now saying he shot himself, though they do say there was a gunfight between the driving vehicles.
[00:28:42.067 --> 00:28:46.851]  I think the police are just making sure that the two patriots can't be sued for doing the right thing and taking this guy out.
[00:28:47.171 --> 00:28:53.537]  But regardless, the cowardly, atheist, globalist SJW is now as dead.
[00:28:53.577 --> 00:28:54.978]  We are on the march.
[00:28:55.399 --> 00:28:57.821]  The empire is on the run.

[00:29:02.383 --> 00:29:03.444]  Take a look at this study.
[00:29:21.477 --> 00:29:26.523]  That we live in an environment that is just loaded with toxic chemicals.
[00:29:26.964 --> 00:29:33.111]  Now they're finding that that environment is actually affecting babies in the prenatal stage.
[00:29:33.411 --> 00:29:35.434]  Specifically when it comes to the telomeres.
[00:29:35.734 --> 00:29:40.320]  So now you have babies prematurely aging because of all the toxins.

[00:33:06.057 --> 00:33:08.670]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.602 --> 00:33:27.543]  Rallying Patriots.
[00:33:27.623 --> 00:33:32.066]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:32.446 --> 00:33:35.528]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:41.793]  Big things are happening in Asia with Trump's visit that the media is trying to spin.
[00:33:44.502 --> 00:33:53.927]  We've got the biggest mass murder shooting in Texas history with an atheist SJW dirtbag as the mainstream media is desperate to cover that up.
[00:33:53.967 --> 00:34:03.692]  We have Rand Paul with a punctured lung and five broken ribs after he got attacked by his SJW neighbor who absolutely hates Rand Paul and President Trump and said so.
[00:34:04.612 --> 00:34:05.633]  We've got all of that.
[00:34:09.215 --> 00:34:13.257]  I've got the whole counter coup going on in Saudi Arabia.
[00:34:14.542 --> 00:34:23.745]  On the plate to cover, where all the big globalist allies of the Bushes and the neocons and the people that support the Arab Spring are all getting arrested!
[00:34:24.466 --> 00:34:30.688]  And some are dying in helicopter crashes, and some are getting killed at their homes because they didn't put their hands up.
[00:34:30.788 --> 00:34:35.650]  I don't support this authoritarianism, but Saudi Arabia is already an authoritarian hellhole.
[00:34:37.056 --> 00:34:37.836]  For the general public.
[00:34:38.596 --> 00:34:49.939]  And so the globalist interlopers that have been working with Iran and trying to double deal against the US, the true bad guys are getting killed because Trump went over there and gave them an offer they couldn't refuse.
[00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:51.999]  Trump is incredible.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:35:03.642]  They are wiping out the SJWs, the pro-globalists, the royal princes that owned Fox News and that were anti-Trump and anti-America, the Clintons,
[00:35:05.185 --> 00:35:09.029]  Biggest supporters, the Bush's biggest supporters, are being wiped out.
[00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.930]  That's a fact.
[00:35:11.252 --> 00:35:14.455]  Trump-era Saudi prince signals death of Bush-Clinton globalism.
[00:35:16.898 --> 00:35:19.701]  And I tell you, Trump is something else, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:19.721 --> 00:35:22.164]  Because see, those that live by the sword, die by the sword.
[00:35:24.266 --> 00:35:26.028]  Those that live by the sword, die by the sword.
[00:35:28.257 --> 00:35:35.560]  And just like Obama put us under the TPP and all these other unelected, tyrannical groups, Trump can kill it with executive power!
[00:35:37.181 --> 00:35:42.243]  Trump is outperforming what I thought he could ever do in the first four years, in the first 11 months.
[00:35:43.223 --> 00:35:46.124]  I am dumbfounded at how real this is.
[00:35:46.184 --> 00:35:46.845]  Is it perfect?
[00:35:46.925 --> 00:35:47.125]  No.
[00:35:48.245 --> 00:35:49.486]  Is he hiring a lot of globalists?
[00:35:50.503 --> 00:35:52.564]  Because they know where the bodies are buried and how to get the job done?
[00:35:52.624 --> 00:35:53.164]  Absolutely.
[00:35:53.424 --> 00:35:54.004]  But you know what?
[00:35:54.465 --> 00:35:55.905]  They're doing what he tells them.
[00:35:56.705 --> 00:35:58.746]  He snaps his fingers and says, jump.
[00:35:59.106 --> 00:36:01.087]  They say, how high, sir?
[00:36:02.868 --> 00:36:04.248]  And that's why they ate his guts.
[00:36:05.529 --> 00:36:06.649]  They want to be in the power.
[00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.090]  They want to be in the structure.
[00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.231]  But they don't like following his orders.
[00:36:10.711 --> 00:36:12.592]  And as the economy turns back on and as
[00:36:13.985 --> 00:36:20.447]  Prosperity comes back, and his optimism comes back, and his pride in things that are good and wholesome comes back.
[00:36:21.167 --> 00:36:28.169]  The whole Hollywood pedophile scumbag network is circling the toilet bowl, and then Donna Brazile comes out.
[00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:31.831]  You can say what you want.
[00:36:33.171 --> 00:36:42.014]  She is a real lady, in that she is not reading off a teleprompter, and that she's a street fighter, and that now she's talking and telling really what she thinks.
[00:36:42.054 --> 00:36:42.934]  She's glowing!
[00:36:44.232 --> 00:36:44.892]  Glowing!
[00:36:46.133 --> 00:36:49.935]  Compared to when she was putting out Clinton talking points, she looked like she'd been run over by a truck.
[00:36:50.595 --> 00:36:54.677]  But now that she's saying what she wants, I want to play most of this interview coming up in the next hour.
[00:36:55.778 --> 00:36:57.519]  Brazil shaken and angered.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.401]  Again, Democrats shaken and angered by Brazil book.
[00:37:02.813 --> 00:37:06.816]  And she basically says Seth Rich was murdered by the DNC.
[00:37:07.676 --> 00:37:09.238]  The Democrats were in bed with the Russians.
[00:37:09.258 --> 00:37:10.218]  She didn't want to be part of it.
[00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:12.220]  They blocked Homeland Security being involved.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.842]  She wanted to remove Hillary off the ticket and put Biden on.
[00:37:18.244 --> 00:37:19.825]  They stole the election from Sanders.
[00:37:21.927 --> 00:37:26.290]  We told you all of that with precision at the time.
[00:37:27.406 --> 00:37:40.931]  And I'm only pointing out why InfoWars is so demonized by mainstream media, and by the Globalists, by the Democrats, and by the RINOs, and why they struggle to keep our information from the President's desk, though now I know that blockade has been lifted.
[00:37:43.952 --> 00:37:49.754]  General Kelly and others hadn't figured out who was who yet, and now there's been some double-crossing going on.
[00:37:51.542 --> 00:38:07.271]  against people in the administration that meant well, but that were fooled by deep staters, and now there's massive solidification behind the president across the board as it becomes apparent Trump's winning, the Trump agenda's winning, and the Trump agenda is powered!
[00:38:07.751 --> 00:38:15.295]  When you open up the engine, when you open up the hood, you see the Pistons, Infowars, Drudge Report,
[00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:19.481]  Sean Hannity.
[00:38:20.362 --> 00:38:25.927]  But driving those pistons are military.
[00:38:26.708 --> 00:38:27.609]  The American people.
[00:38:28.389 --> 00:38:32.113]  Those that didn't back down when Americana was demonized and attacked.
[00:38:32.934 --> 00:38:37.058]  Those that went under the peer pressure and didn't care and didn't give in and didn't take it lying down.
[00:38:38.675 --> 00:38:50.545]  You were the vanguard that made it okay to like free market, and to like success, and to like America, and to promote it against the globalist model that is such a failure for the general public, but so good for the elites.
[00:38:52.767 --> 00:38:59.433]  And because of you, the gasoline, the oxygen, in the pistons, in the carburetor, in the engine,
[00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:09.125]  The economy's come roaring back, and we've seen some dirty white smoke and black smoke shooting out the back of the tailpipe.
[00:39:09.426 --> 00:39:20.234]  There's been some sputtering and some backfires, and the engines sound like it was about to sputter out a couple times, but Trump expertly pumped the accelerator just right, put it in gear.
[00:39:20.914 --> 00:39:32.342]  Got us rolling down the road, put it in other gear and now we're driving down the road 100 miles an hour and there's no smoke coming out the tailpipe and all of a sudden the engine's hitting on all cylinders and sounds smooth and good.
[00:39:33.723 --> 00:39:38.386]  Now Trump can pull the car in to the service station.
[00:39:39.753 --> 00:39:40.354]  We're good to go.
[00:39:57.332 --> 00:40:05.141]  And boy, we snuck in there in the middle of the night, and we put gasoline in there, and we dumped some ether down in the carburetor, and we got it on fire.
[00:40:05.541 --> 00:40:10.927]  Quite frankly, as we drove that old car out of the wrecking yard, she had fire coming out the tailpipe.
[00:40:12.348 --> 00:40:16.193]  And was sputtering and clanking, but we got her down the road, baby.
[00:40:17.725 --> 00:40:18.887]  We got her down the road.
[00:40:18.927 --> 00:40:20.450]  You want an allegory, that's one right there.
[00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:27.382]  And right now, we're about to drive that car into the fine service station of the free republic.
[00:40:28.991 --> 00:40:30.772]  And we are that car, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:31.292 --> 00:40:45.918]  We are that old jalopy, about to get a new engine, a new interior, new brake lines, new brake pads, new mufflers, new paint a coat, new tires, new wheels.
[00:40:45.978 --> 00:40:51.620]  The whole thing, ladies and gentlemen, is going in and about to come out the other side.
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.241]  And the new world order doesn't know what to do.
[00:40:55.137 --> 00:40:56.418]  That's not optimism, by the way.
[00:40:57.119 --> 00:41:01.922]  We can do almost anything with the level of technological development we've already reached.
[00:41:02.262 --> 00:41:09.628]  If we're just not mentally ill, and we just don't give in to the globalists and the social engineers that want to control the whole thing and don't want free market.
[00:41:10.369 --> 00:41:15.813]  If we can just deal with our own evil and our own internal problems, that's all of us individually.
[00:41:16.674 --> 00:41:20.617]  To not drink too much, not eat too much, not be selfish, to not be hateful,
[00:41:21.499 --> 00:41:32.429]  But to be strong, and to work hard, and to thank God for all the blessings we've been given, and to reach out to others, then humanity's future is unbelievably bright.
[00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:37.013]  We have some big obstacles to hurdle first, though.
[00:41:38.454 --> 00:41:40.316]  It's gonna get rougher before it even gets better.
[00:41:41.757 --> 00:41:43.259]  It's an experience we're going through right now.
[00:41:43.299 --> 00:41:43.859]  It's a journey.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.741]  And the journey is the destination.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.941]  We're going to face AI.
[00:41:47.981 --> 00:41:49.061]  We're going to face plagues.
[00:41:49.582 --> 00:41:50.883]  We're going to face nanotech.
[00:41:50.903 --> 00:41:54.465]  We're going to face all sorts of bizarre criminal networks and groups.
[00:41:54.525 --> 00:42:00.529]  We're going to face the evil side of humanity plugging into really high-tech systems.
[00:42:01.049 --> 00:42:05.693]  But we're also going to get a chance to see the good side of humanity plugging into all this as well.
[00:42:06.113 --> 00:42:16.340]  And it's going to be an incredibly spectacular, exciting journey of discovery and contest and warfare and resistance and
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.403]  Striving that we're all about to experience.
[00:42:21.423 --> 00:42:24.245]  Alright, I'm gonna come back and get to the governor's part of his press conference.
[00:42:25.006 --> 00:42:27.488]  Some of the heroes that stopped this guy from killing more people.
[00:42:28.248 --> 00:42:30.630]  And how it was good guys that took out the bad guy with the gun.
[00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:37.015]  And how the globalists are fighting to cover up the fact this guy was an atheist, Christian-hating SJW, a coward, a piece of crap.
[00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:41.111]  Wanted to show everybody what a little spoiled brat baby he was.
[00:42:41.752 --> 00:42:49.895]  How he was going to throw a big temper tantrum and kill his second wife because she didn't want to hang around with a big slob like him.
[00:42:51.056 --> 00:42:53.817]  It's scumbags like this is the reason we've got our Second Amendment.
[00:42:55.178 --> 00:42:57.739]  By the way, overall gun crime's down the last 25 years.
[00:42:57.799 --> 00:42:59.920]  So statistically, gun crime is down.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:00.380]  Stay with us.
[00:43:02.681 --> 00:43:07.123]  I like to do things where I know I can at least take control of it myself personally.
[00:43:08.642 --> 00:43:18.528]  And this isn't a pitch for water filtration, but we go out and find the very best gravity-fed water filters, where it takes out all the garbage, but doesn't take out the good minerals, and then I put my drinking water through that.
[00:43:19.649 --> 00:43:23.492]  And if I'm lazy, I've got reverse osmosis, which really cleans the water, but cuts out the minerals.
[00:43:23.792 --> 00:43:27.574]  So over time, it's probably not too good for you to only drink reverse osmosis.
[00:43:27.594 --> 00:43:28.655]  That's in all the studies.
[00:43:29.215 --> 00:43:31.617]  But the other big area is the shampoo.
[00:43:33.255 --> 00:43:40.519]  And the sunscreens and the cosmetics and the body washes and the soap, which isn't really soap.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:48.384]  So, we've spent, and this is a plug, but it's really informational until the bottom of the hour when Sheriff Arpaio joins us.
[00:43:48.784 --> 00:43:56.729]  We spent years saying we want to get an organic, high quality line of toiletries and personal care products.
[00:43:57.799 --> 00:44:02.260]  So that I can use them in my own home and know from the manufacturer, it's really what they say.
[00:44:03.081 --> 00:44:14.184]  And folks, we got Mark Gonsalves, the owner of Nature's Brands, one of the biggest organic brands in the country, one of the top sellers at Whole Foods.
[00:44:14.424 --> 00:44:16.665]  Everybody recognizes our labeling because he's so nice.
[00:44:17.025 --> 00:44:20.986]  He even let us use basically his labeling, but changed the name to Emmerich's Essentials.
[00:44:21.006 --> 00:44:25.508]  So whether you get it at Whole Foods under his name or from us, what's best about it is
[00:44:27.344 --> 00:44:33.429]  It's on the low end of cost, but better than a lot of the other so-called organic brands, and it's so respected.
[00:44:33.449 --> 00:44:35.611]  But I wanted to get him on because he's the expert.
[00:44:36.251 --> 00:44:43.457]  He's got a bunch of the brands there of what's in some of the other leading brands and some of the other supposed natural brands that really aren't organic.
[00:44:43.477 --> 00:44:45.879]  But Emmerich Essentials is Nature's brand.
[00:44:46.019 --> 00:44:48.281]  We're under a chemical assault.
[00:44:48.641 --> 00:44:50.103]  It's unbelievable to me
[00:44:50.902 --> 00:44:52.423]  What we've allowed to take place.
[00:44:52.643 --> 00:44:56.745]  We've got 84,000 chemicals now in play.
[00:44:57.205 --> 00:45:02.428]  13,000 of which are used in our cosmetics and personal care items and we use these things every single day.
[00:45:03.487 --> 00:45:05.988]  Yet about 10% have ever been tested.
[00:45:06.428 --> 00:45:13.971]  So we always rely on the chemical company to be able to be considered innocent until we end up proving them guilty.
[00:45:14.031 --> 00:45:15.311]  Does that make any sense at all?
[00:45:15.811 --> 00:45:20.933]  So all these things that we put on our body, they are going into our bloodstream.
[00:45:21.213 --> 00:45:24.435]  Takes about 28 seconds to go into our bloodstream.
[00:45:24.695 --> 00:45:25.855]  So here's what we've got.
[00:45:26.115 --> 00:45:28.116]  We've got the FDA that says, hey, you know what?
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:30.241]  For external use only.
[00:45:30.521 --> 00:45:31.181]  Think about this.
[00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:31.842]  Think about this.
[00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:33.302]  They say it's for external use only.
[00:45:33.322 --> 00:45:34.903]  They're not stupid at the FDA.
[00:45:35.183 --> 00:45:37.324]  They know it goes into your bloodstream.
[00:45:37.944 --> 00:45:40.746]  What is the establishment going to do when all this comes out?
[00:45:40.986 --> 00:45:43.547]  It's already come out about bisphenol A and adrenaline.
[00:45:43.787 --> 00:45:45.268]  And then they're still putting it in stuff.
[00:45:45.368 --> 00:45:46.989]  What's going to happen?
[00:45:47.309 --> 00:45:49.250]  Why are they doing it when I've looked it up?
[00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:53.452]  They've got chemicals that are even less expensive that they could be using that have less problems.
[00:45:53.652 --> 00:45:55.273]  It's like they go out of their way to do this.
[00:45:56.394 --> 00:46:00.458]  I think that companies today, are they purposely trying to kill us?
[00:46:00.818 --> 00:46:06.344]  I don't know if I'm going to go quite that far, but what I will say is, they don't seem to care if they do.
[00:46:07.706 --> 00:46:08.587]  They don't seem to care.
[00:46:08.607 --> 00:46:09.067]  Exactly.
[00:46:09.428 --> 00:46:17.436]  Just like Bayer with the hemophiliac factor VIII, they knew it was in there, and they said, you know what, we'll lose money, go ahead and ship these millions of dosages.
[00:46:17.456 --> 00:46:18.037]  These didn't care.
[00:46:19.171 --> 00:46:20.111]  Exactly.
[00:46:20.512 --> 00:46:23.153]  Hey, as a young person, that was Ford with the Pintel, right?
[00:46:23.793 --> 00:46:26.074]  Oh yeah, well, we had 30 gas tanks that would blow up.
[00:46:26.114 --> 00:46:33.177]  Yeah, we'll get sued for millions and millions of dollars, but hey, at the end of the day, that's a heck of a lot cheaper than having to replace all those gas tanks in a recall.
[00:46:33.237 --> 00:46:35.518]  I mean, golly, we've got a business to protect.
[00:46:36.178 --> 00:46:39.700]  Again, when you place a person's well-being
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:48.407]  The bottom rung of the ladder and you place purely profit at the top, that is something seriously wrong.
[00:46:48.507 --> 00:46:49.488]  Well, we're really impressed.
[00:46:49.788 --> 00:46:50.689]  Mark, thank you so much.
[00:46:50.749 --> 00:46:51.750]  NaturesBrands.com.
[00:46:52.050 --> 00:47:00.657]  Folks can get their Enbricks Essentials, private label by you, God bless you, at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:47:00.878 --> 00:47:02.439]  Mark Gonzalez, thank you so much, sir.
[00:47:05.401 --> 00:47:07.984]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:18.513 --> 00:47:23.655]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:25.235 --> 00:47:27.956]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:29.997 --> 00:47:35.978]  Our hearts and prayers go out to the 26 people's family members that survived.
[00:47:36.578 --> 00:47:37.319]  The families of the 26 dead.
[00:47:39.781 --> 00:47:45.343]  Down in Sutherland, Texas, a place I've stopped many times to eat lunch or dinner.
[00:47:46.404 --> 00:47:51.906]  When I'm driving down to the beach or driving back from the beach, you drive right through Sutherland.
[00:47:53.507 --> 00:47:56.208]  And it's got a post office and a couple of restaurants.
[00:47:56.828 --> 00:47:58.589]  But really, it's a one horse town.
[00:47:59.949 --> 00:48:02.670]  Doesn't even really have a stoplight up till you get to the highway.
[00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:05.111]  And it is a farming and ranching area.
[00:48:05.972 --> 00:48:08.153]  And it's a bunch of white people and Hispanics
[00:48:09.147 --> 00:48:12.790]  Down there really don't really see any black folks and they all just get along real well.
[00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.491]  They're all pretty much intermarried.
[00:48:15.672 --> 00:48:23.799]  And it's really, really sad to see things happen like this by a foaming at the mouth evil atheist.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:29.264]  Again, I will not blame all atheists or all liberals or all antifa for this.
[00:48:30.124 --> 00:48:36.770]  But when Dylann Roof went and killed nine innocent black people for no reason because he was a degenerate mentally ill scumbag,
[00:48:39.838 --> 00:48:48.183]  Out of his mind, the media blamed all white people and Christians and Southerners collectively.
[00:48:48.223 --> 00:48:54.386]  And there was all the hysteria, pulling down rebel flags, people getting assaulted that had them, when the rebel flag had nothing to do with slavery.
[00:48:54.626 --> 00:48:57.087]  Today it does, because the media made it a racist symbol.
[00:48:58.688 --> 00:49:00.549]  But I'm not going to sit there and get into that debate.
[00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:06.773]  The point is, is that Texas Shooter liked atheist Facebook pages and SJW causes.
[00:49:07.796 --> 00:49:14.361]  We first broke that yesterday, Paul Watson did, to Infowars.com, and what we broke is now confirmed.
[00:49:14.681 --> 00:49:16.503]  Daily Mail, Associated Press, you name it.
[00:49:17.964 --> 00:49:26.030]  Some other people added images of SJW flags to his own site, which were not there previously, poisoning the True Reports.
[00:49:27.231 --> 00:49:36.778]  So I don't know if that's being done on purpose by folks, or what's going on, but no, it is confirmed, but there is no place where he had the SJW Antifa flag.
[00:49:37.608 --> 00:49:41.289]  He just supported it and linked to it and said he was fighting fascism.
[00:49:44.149 --> 00:49:45.510]  Here's another one out of the Daily Mail.
[00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:47.610]  Creepy, crazy, and weird.
[00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:54.792]  Former classmates say Texas governor was an outcast who preached his atheism online before killing 26 in the state's worst mass shooting ever.
[00:49:55.132 --> 00:50:01.293]  So, by extension, all atheists, all antifa, all SJWs are to blame.
[00:50:05.865 --> 00:50:07.065]  Texas shooting suspect.
[00:50:07.085 --> 00:50:08.646]  Suspect denied gun permit.
[00:50:09.026 --> 00:50:11.627]  Governor says, well of course he had to be denied it.
[00:50:11.647 --> 00:50:13.767]  I'm going to play that first here in a moment.
[00:50:15.508 --> 00:50:16.108]  Governor Abbott.
[00:50:16.908 --> 00:50:19.569]  Because he had a dishonorable discharge.
[00:50:19.949 --> 00:50:22.770]  That's like a criminal conviction in the military.
[00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:28.272]  That's one of the reasons under the 68 gun control act that you can't buy a gun.
[00:50:28.312 --> 00:50:35.494]  If you're a felon, if you've been adjudicated mentally ill, or if you've been dishonorably discharged, you can't buy a gun.
[00:50:37.059 --> 00:50:38.841]  So again, he clearly got the gun illegally.
[00:50:38.881 --> 00:50:39.681]  We're going to find out.
[00:50:40.002 --> 00:50:41.163]  But the media keeps spinning it.
[00:50:41.223 --> 00:50:46.067]  Meanwhile, sharpshooting plumber fired shot that took down Texas church gunman.
[00:50:46.087 --> 00:50:49.330]  We're going to get to some of that coming up in a moment.
[00:50:51.371 --> 00:50:53.773]  Imagine if this had been some other state where people weren't armed.
[00:50:54.114 --> 00:50:55.375]  It could have gone a lot longer.
[00:50:58.783 --> 00:51:06.347]  Now right now, let's go ahead and go to Texas Governor Abbott confirms Devin Patrick Telly was denied gun license.
[00:51:06.387 --> 00:51:06.788]  Here it is.
[00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:16.213]  In terms of how to make it less likely that you see a man like this get access to a weapon like this and be able to do what he did here.
[00:51:18.055 --> 00:51:27.682]  Well obviously people want answers but equally obvious here we are less than a day after the event happened where there's more unknowns than there are knowns.
[00:51:27.982 --> 00:51:44.293]  Like let me share with you this one fact that I am told by the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety and that is that Devin Kelly sought to get a license to carry a gun in the state of Texas but the state of Texas denied him the ability to get a gun.
[00:51:44.673 --> 00:51:47.075]  So how was it that he was able to get a gun?
[00:51:47.635 --> 00:51:55.700]  By all the facts that we seem to know, he was not supposed to have access to a gun, so how did this happen?
[00:51:56.021 --> 00:51:59.203]  But Chris, that is just one of the unknowns out there.
[00:51:59.703 --> 00:52:05.087]  We are in search of answers to these questions, and the answers will be coming to light here in the coming days.
[00:52:05.507 --> 00:52:10.550]  And before we can... And as the Lieutenant Governor said, this is clearly an anti-Christian targeting.
[00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:12.892]  Like if a white guy targets a black church,
[00:52:13.732 --> 00:52:16.294]  You can pretty much bet he didn't like black people, Dylann Roof.
[00:52:16.794 --> 00:52:19.276]  Well, if this guy's targeting a church, you can tell he doesn't like Christians.
[00:52:19.696 --> 00:52:22.497]  And then, lo and behold, he's an atheist who hated Christians.
[00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:25.900]  This is all 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:33.704]  In a motive, in an event, you look at who's targeted to find the motive.
[00:52:35.285 --> 00:52:40.709]  Now, here is one of the heroes of the Texas church shooting tells of car chase after gunman
[00:52:42.037 --> 00:52:52.440]  Again, he was the second person to join in after the sharpshooting plumber fired a shot that took down the Texas Church gunman.
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.582]  The man hails a hero for confronting the Texas mass shooter during his rampage as a sharpshooting plumber.
[00:52:58.402 --> 00:53:02.666]  With no military background, who hit the gunman through a gap in his body armor, according to a report.
[00:53:03.467 --> 00:53:12.155]  Stephen Williford managed to shoot Devin Kelly before jumping in another man's truck and chasing him down, the Daily Mail has reported.
[00:53:12.195 --> 00:53:15.078]  And it goes on to say that they did, the police have now released more.
[00:53:16.079 --> 00:53:18.341]  So they had a rolling gun battle at 95 miles an hour.
[00:53:22.651 --> 00:53:26.992]  And that basically shot him again and made him go off the road and, quote, wrecked out.
[00:53:27.712 --> 00:53:31.153]  Now, the police are saying that he may have died of a soul-hooked gunshot wound.
[00:53:31.173 --> 00:53:35.874]  I think the police are doing that so that there's no liability for the citizens that actually took him out.
[00:53:36.514 --> 00:53:37.095]  But we'll see.
[00:53:37.135 --> 00:53:40.155]  Regardless, they stopped him, they shot him, they drove him off the road.
[00:53:40.816 --> 00:53:49.758]  Here is Johnny Langendorf, who drove the other man during the ongoing gun battle, like something out of the movie The Road Warrior.
[00:53:49.778 --> 00:53:50.158]  Here it is.
[00:53:51.075 --> 00:53:53.536]  I just pulled up to an intersection and saw gunfire.
[00:53:53.756 --> 00:53:54.776]  The shooter got in his truck.
[00:53:55.316 --> 00:54:07.578]  The gentleman with the rifle came to my truck as the shooter took off and he briefly, he briefed me quickly on what had just happened and said that we had to get him and so that's what I did.
[00:54:07.878 --> 00:54:15.840]  We hit about 95 going down 539 trying to catch this guy until he eventually lost control on his own and went off in the ditch.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:20.401]  He just kind of, he went off in the ditch, hit a hay bale from what I could see.
[00:54:21.161 --> 00:54:22.722]  And then he just never moved after that.
[00:54:22.742 --> 00:54:23.402]  He didn't get out.
[00:54:23.542 --> 00:54:24.483]  He didn't try anything.
[00:54:24.923 --> 00:54:27.744]  Once the police showed up, they moved me and the gentleman back.
[00:54:28.185 --> 00:54:30.746]  And then everybody showed up and they took action.
[00:54:31.346 --> 00:54:32.887]  I didn't really have time to hear about anything.
[00:54:32.967 --> 00:54:34.167]  It was more see and do.
[00:54:36.048 --> 00:54:37.469]  Act now, ask questions later.
[00:54:37.869 --> 00:54:39.610]  He just affected so many people's lives.
[00:54:40.551 --> 00:54:47.294]  Why wouldn't you want to... So you see the best and worst in people at times like this.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:58.622]  A area resident told the paper that Williford, an avid biker who attends another church, learned about the shooting when his daughter called to say a man clad in body armor was shooting worshippers.
[00:54:59.222 --> 00:55:09.725]  The local said that although Williford had no military background, he didn't hesitate when it came to face-to-face with a suspect he managed to squeeze off a round that struck the gunman who dropped his Ruger AR-15 variant.
[00:55:10.945 --> 00:55:18.367]  Williford jumped into a truck driven by another local, Johnny Langendorf, who you just heard from, who witnessed the confrontation in the Paragate Chase.
[00:55:18.407 --> 00:55:21.007]  Langendorf later told reporters about the dramatic pursuit.
[00:55:21.648 --> 00:55:28.269]  I pulled up to the intersection where the shooting happened and I saw two men exchanging gunfire, the other being the citizen of the community, he said.
[00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:37.631]  The shooter of the church had taken off, fled in his vehicle, and the other gentleman came up and said, we need to pursue him, and then he just shot up the church.
[00:55:38.011 --> 00:55:39.152]  So that's what we did.
[00:55:39.272 --> 00:55:39.872]  I just acted.
[00:55:40.512 --> 00:55:43.494]  And then it goes on to break down what they did.
[00:55:45.755 --> 00:55:51.599]  Langendorff's girlfriend, Summer Cadell, said Kelly died a few feet away from Langendorff.
[00:55:51.919 --> 00:55:54.801]  The local men said Kelly had already dead when they found him.
[00:55:55.061 --> 00:55:59.024]  He was bleeding pretty bad, the resident told the news outlet, of Kelly while he was driving.
[00:55:59.064 --> 00:56:01.205]  He didn't live much longer than that.
[00:56:01.646 --> 00:56:03.787]  Martin confirmed police had found Kelly dead.
[00:56:05.528 --> 00:56:06.229]  So there you go.
[00:56:07.269 --> 00:56:07.930]  That's what happened.
[00:56:08.953 --> 00:56:13.234]  And you can read the state police account, it basically matches that.
[00:56:13.994 --> 00:56:17.956]  But that is great that they acted quickly and ended up killing this slimeball.
[00:56:19.456 --> 00:56:36.921]  Because remember, Cuomo on CNN that wants to ban your guns has his own bodyguards, and his thug brother has his own bodyguards, and the ruling class has their own bodyguards as they bring in hundreds of thousands of military-age men from the Middle East carrying out weekly terror attacks on the American people.
[00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:41.931]  Yes, because that's somebody you brought in artificially that wants to kill us.
[00:56:58.158 --> 00:56:59.859]  A lot of these folks call themselves atheists.
[00:57:00.199 --> 00:57:01.540]  They really mean they're anti-christian.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:05.101]  It's kind of like, if they call themselves anti-fascist, they're really communist.
[00:57:06.282 --> 00:57:08.623]  And I've told you, a lot of these folks are devil-worshippers.
[00:57:08.943 --> 00:57:09.744]  They hate Christians.
[00:57:09.784 --> 00:57:10.664]  It's what they want to do.
[00:57:11.204 --> 00:57:17.207]  And everybody needs to be armed to protect themselves legally and lawfully in this day and age.
[00:57:17.247 --> 00:57:18.548]  Because even though statistically
[00:57:19.028 --> 00:57:21.354]  It's rare to be shot and killed in this country.
[00:57:21.835 --> 00:57:28.091]  It's becoming more common in those statistics to be killed by a leftist who's gone and gotten firearms training.
[00:57:29.133 --> 00:57:32.977]  Alright folks, second hour coming up with a bunch of special guests, your phone calls and more.

[00:59:54.545 --> 01:00:00.428]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.488 --> 01:00:10.429]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:12.771]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:22.572 --> 01:00:28.317]  Coming up, Mark Farber, one of the top investors and analysts out there.
[01:00:28.337 --> 01:00:31.099]  You know him from CNN, MSNBC, you name it.
[01:00:31.979 --> 01:00:38.024]  He's going to be joining us about the world economy, but also statements he made where he's sick of hearing Europeans being demonized.
[01:00:38.744 --> 01:00:41.306]  He said, thank God, you know, Europeans colonized the U.S.
[01:00:41.326 --> 01:00:41.967]  or it wouldn't be here.
[01:00:44.529 --> 01:00:45.650]  I've seen this new movement have
[01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:51.574]  Bumper stickers or signs put up around town that say it's okay to be white.
[01:00:52.234 --> 01:00:58.840]  That's why we're gonna put out a t-shirt that says it's okay to be white, it's okay to be black, it's okay to be red, it's okay to be pink.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.142]  Some kind of pink skin like a little gecko.
[01:01:03.204 --> 01:01:04.124]  Kind of translucent.
[01:01:05.426 --> 01:01:06.587]  It's great to be human.
[01:01:08.308 --> 01:01:09.469]  And on the back, 100% red-blooded.
[01:01:09.489 --> 01:01:09.809]  Infowars.com.
[01:01:15.694 --> 01:01:23.615]  Because we've all got one flag, we all bleed red blood, they've been using tribalism against us to manipulate us, but we are going to come out with that t-shirt.
[01:01:25.656 --> 01:01:29.396]  And they're calling it racist and evil to have signs saying it's okay to be white.
[01:01:29.997 --> 01:01:41.739]  No, I think in the face of racism, and the globalists trying to invoke all this race baiting by white desperate SJWs, to say it's okay to be white, it's okay to be black, but at the end, it's great to be human.
[01:01:42.119 --> 01:01:43.099]  And that's what we all are.
[01:01:44.295 --> 01:01:46.836]  And we've all got red blood, we've all got two lungs, one heart.
[01:01:47.897 --> 01:01:50.558]  I mean, it's like a black dog versus a white dog.
[01:01:50.618 --> 01:01:53.600]  I mean, it really is the exact same thing.
[01:01:55.541 --> 01:02:01.984]  That a black dog has the genes for black fur, and a white dog has genes for white fur.
[01:02:02.004 --> 01:02:06.927]  A black dog will usually have brown skin, and a white dog will have pink skin.
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:10.461]  You'll see two guinea pigs, you know, in a cage together.
[01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:11.961]  One's black, one's white, getting along.
[01:02:12.622 --> 01:02:13.502]  Where did all this start?
[01:02:13.542 --> 01:02:16.543]  Well, it's tribalism, because groups always find a reason to kill each other.
[01:02:17.103 --> 01:02:18.284]  Like the Star Trek episode.
[01:02:19.664 --> 01:02:23.406]  And there are real differences in variance in groups on average.
[01:02:26.035 --> 01:02:27.835]  Like long-distance runners, most of them are Kenyan.
[01:02:27.855 --> 01:02:29.936]  You know, the Africans can't even compete.
[01:02:29.976 --> 01:02:31.896]  But that's that tiny one-tenth of one percent.
[01:02:32.656 --> 01:02:36.857]  And then the other runners from around the world are like, you know, ten yards behind them every time when they lose.
[01:02:36.897 --> 01:02:39.297]  It's just a tiny fraction type thing.
[01:02:39.637 --> 01:02:45.978]  You can argue Northern Europeans have the biggest CC-sized brains and higher IQs, but then you can argue it's all how the IQ test is given.
[01:02:46.018 --> 01:02:47.659]  And again, it's that upper end.
[01:02:47.719 --> 01:02:48.359]  Yes, it's true.
[01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:52.220]  But it's all apples and oranges, folks.
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:53.080]  We're all human.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.780]  We're in this experience together.
[01:02:56.192 --> 01:03:00.474]  And the culture is trying to dumb us all down to make us pliable and controllable.
[01:03:00.674 --> 01:03:02.235]  And that's not just our observations.
[01:03:02.575 --> 01:03:15.921]  We have it from government documents and white papers and WikiLeaks and eco-science that the globalists really are trying to control the future and trying to very covetously dominate humanity and dumb people down.
[01:03:16.041 --> 01:03:19.903]  And that's really the big sin, isn't it?
[01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:23.845]  And so that's what I'm personally trying to expose best I can.
[01:03:25.013 --> 01:03:26.734]  Mark Faber is going to be with us for 30 minutes.
[01:03:27.395 --> 01:03:33.959]  Then I'm going to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour on your take on the Texas mass shooting and more your take on Donna Brazile.
[01:03:33.979 --> 01:03:38.422]  We've got more clips of Donna Brazile coming up saying she would have removed Hillary and put Biden in.
[01:03:38.922 --> 01:03:39.743]  We said that at the time.
[01:03:39.763 --> 01:03:41.544]  That was being looked at from our sources.
[01:03:42.144 --> 01:03:44.266]  Roger Stone's got incredible sources, let me tell you.
[01:03:45.647 --> 01:03:46.767]  We've got other sources as well.
[01:03:47.848 --> 01:03:51.971]  And that Seth Rich, they believe, was murdered for the DNC leaks.
[01:03:56.914 --> 01:04:00.800]  And so all that's coming out now, this is rats leaving the sinking ship.
[01:04:02.322 --> 01:04:04.466]  We'll get your take on that as well.
[01:04:05.026 --> 01:04:08.311]  But whatever you do, be sure and tune in in the fourth hour.
[01:04:09.847 --> 01:04:17.556]  Because we have Matt Dubiel, the station manager of our Chicago flagship, 1530 AM, also has an FM station.
[01:04:18.056 --> 01:04:19.538]  He's got a big announcement coming very soon.
[01:04:19.558 --> 01:04:21.721]  I'm not going to get to it yet, but we're very, very excited about it.
[01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:30.451]  And then we also have, in the third hour, Scott Adams of the great cartoon Dilbert, who is a super smart fellow.
[01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:32.750]  Always informative.
[01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:36.592]  He's going to be joining us with his predictions and a lot more.
[01:04:37.013 --> 01:04:39.534]  He's had a lot of accurate predictions, like Trump will be elected.
[01:04:39.954 --> 01:04:42.056]  That's all coming up as well.
[01:04:42.716 --> 01:04:44.898]  So, Mark Faber of the Gloom, Doom Report.
[01:04:45.638 --> 01:04:46.719]  Gloom, Doom, Boom Report.
[01:04:47.299 --> 01:04:51.742]  And then we've got, of course, Dilbert coming on and so much more.
[01:04:52.203 --> 01:04:54.704]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com.
[01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:58.887]  Again, it's an act of serious rebellion and victory against the globalists.
[01:04:59.207 --> 01:05:01.589]  When you share the videos and articles, you are unstoppable.
[01:05:04.833 --> 01:05:09.716]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[01:05:10.517 --> 01:05:13.459]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:16.921]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[01:05:17.542 --> 01:05:22.425]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:29.089]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[01:05:29.449 --> 01:05:34.613]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[01:05:35.273 --> 01:05:38.696]  That's why I recommend Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[01:05:39.276 --> 01:05:47.102]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[01:05:47.683 --> 01:05:52.026]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[01:05:52.366 --> 01:05:56.289]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.
[01:05:56.589 --> 01:06:00.412]  Stay in the game with Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Natural Deodorant.
[01:06:00.652 --> 01:06:02.313]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:10.587 --> 01:06:25.057]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:37.586]  Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, one of the most popular comic strips in history, and who is also a really smart guy and kind of a futurist in his own right.
[01:06:38.604 --> 01:06:41.070]  He also looks at how to manipulate words in the media.
[01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:43.336]  He's going to be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[01:06:43.356 --> 01:06:46.263]  For the next 30 minutes, Dr. Mark Faber.
[01:06:47.526 --> 01:06:51.348]  Famed guest of CNBC, you name it, joins us.
[01:06:51.368 --> 01:06:59.973]  I'm going to go over his whole bio from Zurich, Switzerland and the billions that he's managed and all the big successful predictions he's made.
[01:06:59.993 --> 01:07:09.299]  He publishes a widely read monthly investment newsletter, the Gloom, Boom and Doom Report, which highlights unusual investment opportunities.
[01:07:09.799 --> 01:07:15.843]  I'm not going to go through it all, but he's a bestseller in Japanese, Chinese, Thai, German, English, you name it.
[01:07:16.383 --> 01:07:18.924]  He's a regular speaker at various investment seminars.
[01:07:19.524 --> 01:07:21.785]  Gloomboomdoom.com.
[01:07:22.545 --> 01:07:25.646]  But he also got in big SJW trouble lately.
[01:07:26.967 --> 01:07:31.728]  We've seen the leftist professors everywhere saying, kill all the white people.
[01:07:32.389 --> 01:07:34.049]  And white people are inherently evil.
[01:07:34.129 --> 01:07:35.890]  And they're mainly white folks saying this.
[01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:38.871]  And we know in the WikiLeaks they say, we want culture war.
[01:07:39.311 --> 01:07:41.532]  We want everybody fighting with each other while we rob them.
[01:07:42.622 --> 01:07:46.787]  But then Faber simply said, well, thank God the U.S.
[01:07:46.827 --> 01:07:54.257]  got populated by Europeans because they brought in the Renaissance and technology or we wouldn't have our modern civilization.
[01:07:54.978 --> 01:07:56.600]  So we should have some love.
[01:07:57.879 --> 01:07:58.780]  For the Renaissance.
[01:07:58.820 --> 01:07:59.861]  Some love for the West.
[01:07:59.941 --> 01:08:02.443]  I know I like other inventions and things.
[01:08:02.463 --> 01:08:05.305]  You know, we get from China or, you know, wherever.
[01:08:05.345 --> 01:08:08.868]  And I certainly like coffee and things like that from the Americas.
[01:08:08.908 --> 01:08:10.709]  I mean, it all makes us richer, our cultures.
[01:08:10.769 --> 01:08:15.193]  But it's really in now to demonize white people.
[01:08:15.273 --> 01:08:20.236]  And so Mark Faubert, not known as an evil white supremacist, has gotten in a lot of trouble.
[01:08:20.617 --> 01:08:24.019]  I've been labeled by the mainstream media as a racist, Dr. Boom.
[01:08:24.119 --> 01:08:25.661]  Mark Faubert fires back.
[01:08:26.161 --> 01:08:34.766]  So I wanted to get him on about the economy, get him on about Trump, get him on about all this and let him to actually respond versus what MSM has been twisting.
[01:08:35.267 --> 01:08:36.547]  Mark, good to have you on with us.
[01:08:38.329 --> 01:08:38.789]  Thank you.
[01:08:39.329 --> 01:08:40.870]  It's a pleasure to be on your show.
[01:08:41.691 --> 01:08:42.511]  Where should we start?
[01:08:45.293 --> 01:08:55.059]  Wherever you want to start, you know, we can start with the history of civilizations or we can start with racism because it comes in many different forms.
[01:08:56.332 --> 01:09:00.373]  And most people actually don't really know what racism is.
[01:09:01.113 --> 01:09:15.937]  Well let's start with a brief history of the world and then get into race and then let's get into where you see the economy currently and the left's now eating itself, the Democratic Party's imploding, the EU globalists are imploding and I think they better understand people are rejecting all this race baiting.
[01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:21.918]  Well the thing is this, if you look back at let's say
[01:09:22.768 --> 01:09:27.930]  Recorded history, we go back 5000 years to roughly 3000 BC.
[01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:40.654]  Then we had civilizations rising, and then civilizations declining, usually through internal strife or decadence and so forth.
[01:09:43.075 --> 01:09:47.016]  We had cities becoming important and then cities contracting.
[01:09:47.116 --> 01:09:49.157]  I wrote the book once a long time ago,
[01:09:49.864 --> 01:09:52.705]  The rise and the fall of great cities.
[01:09:53.725 --> 01:10:06.850]  And, I mean, it's very interesting when you look at, say, year 3000 BC, the Egyptians, they built Karnak, Luxor, and they built the pyramids.
[01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:14.493]  At that time, the Europeans were still living in caverns, still on lakes.
[01:10:15.073 --> 01:10:15.153]  And
[01:10:16.075 --> 01:10:23.298]  So we had an incredibly advanced civilization in Egypt in the year 3000 BC.
[01:10:23.718 --> 01:10:29.900]  And then we had the Assyrian Empire and the Persian Empire.
[01:10:30.761 --> 01:10:41.765]  And then we had the Greeks, Alexander the Greek, who, by the way, he was very good at destroying cities and took most of the population right away into slavery.
[01:10:43.007 --> 01:10:45.588]  It was the pattern for the last few thousand years.
[01:10:46.488 --> 01:10:52.051]  Essentially, the men were killed and the women were taken into slavery, or both.
[01:10:53.311 --> 01:10:57.353]  And so we have this continuous change.
[01:10:57.733 --> 01:10:58.693]  We had the Romans.
[01:10:58.773 --> 01:11:01.254]  The Romans were incredibly advanced.
[01:11:01.994 --> 01:11:06.956]  And before the Romans, in another part of the world, which was not very well known, it was China.
[01:11:07.557 --> 01:11:10.838]  The Chinese were incredibly advanced.
[01:11:11.852 --> 01:11:13.974]  And so we have this pattern.
[01:11:13.994 --> 01:11:17.376]  Now we come to the discovery voyages.
[01:11:17.856 --> 01:11:22.380]  The discovery voyages were actually a very risky enterprise.
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:28.924]  Vasco de Gama, 1497, discovery of the Cape of Good Hope.
[01:11:29.164 --> 01:11:31.926]  Magellan circumvented the world.
[01:11:32.267 --> 01:11:35.269]  Columbus, he went to the US.
[01:11:35.945 --> 01:11:38.026]  These were not just adventurers.
[01:11:38.546 --> 01:11:45.669]  These were people who took a huge risk because they took voyages into the unknown.
[01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:51.051]  And so we have essentially the Europeans arriving in the US.
[01:11:51.791 --> 01:11:58.354]  And we had also the age of colonialism and imperialism in other parts of the world.
[01:11:58.594 --> 01:12:03.776]  And of course, the white man was cruel.
[01:12:04.813 --> 01:12:06.274]  There's no question about this.
[01:12:07.315 --> 01:12:13.919]  But other people were equally cruel or even more cruel than white men.
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:21.565]  And at least over the last hundred years or so, we've become somewhat more human, although I'm not sure about that.
[01:12:21.645 --> 01:12:24.987]  But the others, sometimes they haven't become more human.
[01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:32.272]  And if we look at the history of World War One and World War Two, we know very well that other people
[01:12:33.004 --> 01:12:35.025]  We're extremely cruel as well.
[01:12:36.065 --> 01:12:37.345]  Not just the white man.
[01:12:37.365 --> 01:12:37.785]  Exactly.
[01:12:37.865 --> 01:12:41.906]  So all you did was point out what is admitted known history.
[01:12:42.167 --> 01:12:44.207]  They're now saying mathematics is racist.
[01:12:44.587 --> 01:12:46.028]  Costume parties are racist.
[01:12:46.548 --> 01:12:53.830]  It looks like the social engineers are staking out all of reality and claiming that everything must go through them like a cult.
[01:12:57.131 --> 01:12:57.351]  Yes.
[01:12:58.611 --> 01:13:01.952]  It's a very unfortunate event because I think
[01:13:03.041 --> 01:13:14.284]  That when I look at the world development over the last 30, 40 years, we have essentially the globalization starting in the 80s.
[01:13:14.684 --> 01:13:22.826]  And we have the breakdown of the socialist communist ideology, starting with the opening of China in 1978 under Deng Xiaoping.
[01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:37.602]  Then we have the breakdown of the Berlin Wall and Russia turning essentially into a more capitalistic-oriented economy.
[01:13:39.023 --> 01:13:49.546]  And when the European expansion really started with the so-called Industrial Revolution, which had probably begun already around 1750, but I want to say this,
[01:13:54.096 --> 01:14:07.521]  The European Industrial Revolution was, of course, possible because the Europeans, and that every historian will point out, they invented something that the others never had.
[01:14:08.362 --> 01:14:10.082]  And that is capitalism.
[01:14:11.563 --> 01:14:15.905]  Capitalism is not conquering another country and just ripping them off.
[01:14:16.471 --> 01:14:20.735]  But it's working for a continuous and recurring profit.
[01:14:21.336 --> 01:14:23.277]  And you need double accounting.
[01:14:23.377 --> 01:14:27.341]  No other country in the world has double accounting standards.
[01:14:27.721 --> 01:14:28.682]  The Europeans had.
[01:14:29.423 --> 01:14:38.812]  And then because of the age of Renaissance and the age of Enlightenment,
[01:14:39.577 --> 01:14:46.643]  We had all these inventors and all these scientists who suddenly said, the world is not flat.
[01:14:47.163 --> 01:14:51.466]  So the West invented the middle class and capitalism, which is now the model of the world.
[01:14:51.767 --> 01:14:57.511]  So why are the ultra elites and the ruling classes waging war against the fount of success?
[01:14:57.571 --> 01:14:59.353]  It's because they don't want competition.
[01:14:59.753 --> 01:15:01.094]  They want this new austerity.
[01:15:01.434 --> 01:15:02.775]  They want their new world order.
[01:15:02.935 --> 01:15:04.417]  If you agree with me, say yes, please, sir.
[01:15:04.437 --> 01:15:08.500]  And then I want to expand into, is globalism in its authoritarian model
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:09.801]  Now falling apart.
[01:15:11.122 --> 01:15:12.963]  Yes.
[01:15:14.265 --> 01:15:31.599]  The ruling European political class, as well as the US, they may not know, but the point is simply, you know, in 1970, China consumed 2% of global industrial commodities.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:33.260]  By 1990, it was 5%.
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:33.981]  In the year 2000, it was 12%.
[01:15:38.499 --> 01:15:39.439]  Now it's over 50%.
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:43.901]  This is a major change.
[01:15:44.441 --> 01:15:52.464]  It's not that the West has absolutely collapsed, but relative to the rest of the world, they have been contracting massively.
[01:15:52.484 --> 01:15:52.844]  That's right.
[01:15:52.864 --> 01:15:56.725]  Let's talk about why that's happening and where it's going with Mark Faubert, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:57.045 --> 01:15:58.986]  Straight ahead after this quick break, we're very honored to have him.
[01:15:59.246 --> 01:16:01.226]  Really smart guy, very smart historian.
[01:16:04.068 --> 01:16:13.897]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[01:16:14.718 --> 01:16:24.087]  And today we see the leftist, the globalist, controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[01:16:24.507 --> 01:16:27.470]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:37.739]  Clothing is a statement, and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud, just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:43.404]  So right now, folks, we're gonna debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the InfoWars store.
[01:16:44.465 --> 01:16:46.186]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[01:16:46.246 --> 01:16:47.186]  It's a limited edition.
[01:16:47.746 --> 01:16:49.727]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[01:16:49.967 --> 01:16:56.709]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[01:16:57.030 --> 01:17:01.211]  On the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:09.059]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows that organizations like CNN are owned by foreign multinational corporations, hell-bent on enslaving this country.
[01:17:09.339 --> 01:17:18.148]  So when you expose them as fake news, you're doing your patriotic duty, and you're exercising your First Amendment in defiance of their bullying, garbage, and tyranny.
[01:17:18.569 --> 01:17:22.733]  And on the back, InfoWars.com is the standard of real news.
[01:17:23.253 --> 01:17:24.335]  And of course, this classic?
[01:17:25.035 --> 01:17:25.636]  Says it all.
[01:17:25.736 --> 01:17:26.617]  Need I say more?
[01:17:27.117 --> 01:17:28.719]  You want to have a political message out there?
[01:17:28.759 --> 01:17:34.524]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[01:17:34.865 --> 01:17:37.968]  Then this is the shirt for you at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:17:38.388 --> 01:17:43.973]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:47.035]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[01:17:47.336 --> 01:17:55.741]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[01:17:56.001 --> 01:17:59.563]  And this shirt, The Spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[01:18:00.383 --> 01:18:09.874]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Labe or Come and Take It in good old-fashioned English t-shirts.
[01:18:10.014 --> 01:18:12.497]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[01:18:12.878 --> 01:18:14.499]  InfoWars.com to spread the word.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.341]  I designed this baby.
[01:18:16.421 --> 01:18:18.843]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[01:18:19.223 --> 01:18:23.486]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[01:18:23.867 --> 01:18:27.710]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:30.832]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[01:18:30.852 --> 01:18:32.233]  It's been around about 19 years.
[01:18:32.873 --> 01:18:36.456]  It's the classic Infowars tyranny response team shirt.
[01:18:36.736 --> 01:18:39.839]  And of course, we've seen the NFL taking a knee.
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:44.343]  Uh, during the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[01:18:45.064 --> 01:18:45.945]  That's disrespectful.
[01:18:45.965 --> 01:18:49.969]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[01:18:50.049 --> 01:18:57.516]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[01:18:57.896 --> 01:18:59.378]  Our republic is in distress.
[01:18:59.818 --> 01:19:00.319]  Ask me why.
[01:19:00.959 --> 01:19:02.921]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[01:19:03.021 --> 01:19:08.565]  Good old camouflage with the Dayglo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[01:19:09.006 --> 01:19:10.507]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[01:19:10.567 --> 01:19:13.549]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go out and put another shirt on.
[01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:16.151]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[01:19:16.772 --> 01:19:19.014]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[01:19:19.721 --> 01:19:20.503]  It's all about freedom.
[01:19:20.543 --> 01:19:21.885]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[01:19:22.406 --> 01:19:23.328]  Resist Tyranny.
[01:19:23.969 --> 01:19:24.971]  Made in America.
[01:19:24.991 --> 01:19:24.971]  1776.
[01:19:25.592 --> 01:19:28.698]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[01:19:28.919 --> 01:19:29.881]  The backs are really cool.
[01:19:30.241 --> 01:19:30.903]  Look at that back.
[01:19:30.963 --> 01:19:31.885]  That is pure Americana.
[01:19:33.089 --> 01:19:38.252]  And I almost forgot, we've got dozens and dozens of great limited-edition ball caps available.
[01:19:38.352 --> 01:19:39.033]  The Dayglo.
[01:19:39.573 --> 01:19:43.656]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[01:19:43.816 --> 01:19:45.437]  This is my favorite ball cap.
[01:19:45.797 --> 01:19:47.118]  Over 20 ball caps we've put out.
[01:19:47.358 --> 01:19:50.901]  It's got the nice patch, Infowars.com, the Don't Tread On Me.
[01:19:51.161 --> 01:19:54.583]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[01:19:55.003 --> 01:19:56.584]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[01:19:56.845 --> 01:20:01.328]  Thank you all for your support, and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:08.595]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:27.896 --> 01:20:32.019]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:32.639 --> 01:20:36.542]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:58.076 --> 01:21:00.897]  For saying we ought to be proud of modern Western civilization.
[01:21:01.217 --> 01:21:03.178]  He's written books on the bad parts, the good parts.
[01:21:03.198 --> 01:21:05.418]  He's written books on other civilizations.
[01:21:05.438 --> 01:21:09.200]  He's widely read around the world and admired by many other cultures.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.120]  I know that as a fact.
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:11.860]  And so he's so demonized.
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.121]  Why does he think that happened?
[01:21:13.481 --> 01:21:26.865]  And then let's segue into why the West is contracting, why it's self-loathing, and what he thinks of the Trump phenomenon, and where the economy is going, and can the nationalism we see coming up in Europe, coming up in other areas,
[01:21:27.425 --> 01:21:47.445]  Yes, I mean, this is a very tough question, but I'd like to say that the welfare of the people has always been the alibi of the tyrant.
[01:21:48.795 --> 01:21:53.878]  And, you know, they tell you, well, everybody has to be the same and get some money.
[01:21:53.958 --> 01:21:57.039]  And we have basic income eventually and this and that.
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:59.440]  But basically, it's about power.
[01:22:00.341 --> 01:22:01.341]  And it's about money.
[01:22:01.842 --> 01:22:05.003]  We know that the political establishment has made a lot of money.
[01:22:05.023 --> 01:22:11.447]  A lot of money has disappeared from the Defense Department, from the State Department.
[01:22:11.807 --> 01:22:15.128]  And the same goes in Europe.
[01:22:15.449 --> 01:22:18.150]  The Americans, they go and tell the world about corruption.
[01:22:19.218 --> 01:22:27.063]  Yeah, we have corruption in Asia, but I can tell you, I think the big corruption is actually where the governments are very big.
[01:22:27.984 --> 01:22:31.486]  And the biggest governments as a percent of the economy are in Europe.
[01:22:31.987 --> 01:22:34.969]  The more government you have, the less freedom you have.
[01:22:35.109 --> 01:22:39.892]  Milton Friedman, he explained this very well in his book, Capitalism and Freedom.
[01:22:40.493 --> 01:22:43.455]  The larger the government, the extreme is of course,
[01:22:44.804 --> 01:22:46.186]  Absolutely.
[01:22:46.226 --> 01:22:50.311]  I notice you've got a bust of Mao Zedong behind you.
[01:22:50.411 --> 01:22:52.073]  I don't think you're a fan though.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.641]  I'm not a fan of him.
[01:23:05.661 --> 01:23:16.845]  I'm not a fan of any politician, except maybe you could argue that Adenauer, after the Second World War, he was a great leader.
[01:23:17.365 --> 01:23:19.826]  He healed the German nation.
[01:23:20.626 --> 01:23:26.949]  But Mao is, of course, a villain like Stalin, like Hitler and like Napoleon.
[01:23:27.289 --> 01:23:30.190]  But some are perceived in a better light than others.
[01:23:31.002 --> 01:23:33.244]  But they're all kind of evil people.
[01:23:33.404 --> 01:23:49.357]  But one thing about Mao, and this is also interesting about Stalin, Stalin is the most popular leader of Russia ever, including all the czars, because he defeated the Germans.
[01:23:50.718 --> 01:23:58.564]  And the Mao, I have to give him credit, you see, what happened is China, and by the way, also India, they had a thriving
[01:24:00.807 --> 01:24:05.591]  economy and the thriving social system until about 1780.
[01:24:06.432 --> 01:24:20.684]  But by 1780, most big nations that made at the time China and India 60% of the global economy, at that time the US was much smaller, they started to decay.
[01:24:20.704 --> 01:24:27.570]  The decay was then accelerated also by imperialism and colonialism.
[01:24:28.217 --> 01:24:30.418]  And again, you've written about the rise and fall of nations.
[01:24:30.438 --> 01:24:31.659]  These are historical facts.
[01:24:31.999 --> 01:24:35.061]  You spoke about the West being in decline and said we should stop bashing it.
[01:24:35.341 --> 01:24:37.282]  It's been a good thing overall until its decline.
[01:24:37.622 --> 01:24:38.743]  They're calling that racist.
[01:24:38.843 --> 01:24:43.765]  Why is there such an internal hatred in the West of Renaissance and free market?
[01:24:43.785 --> 01:24:44.766]  And where do you see the U.S.
[01:24:44.806 --> 01:24:46.527]  economy and global economy going?
[01:24:48.428 --> 01:24:50.509]  Well, it's very difficult to tell.
[01:24:51.089 --> 01:24:56.492]  But I think that the Western leaders subconsciously
[01:24:57.336 --> 01:25:00.337]  realise that they have to control the population somehow.
[01:25:01.238 --> 01:25:06.099]  And one way to control it is to make everybody more or less equal.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:18.905]  And I just want to mention, because many people don't realise, democracy and social security is an experiment.
[01:25:19.565 --> 01:25:21.506]  We don't know how long it will last.
[01:25:22.046 --> 01:25:25.127]  For the last 5000 years, we didn't have democracies.
[01:25:25.979 --> 01:25:31.260]  And now for the last 200 years, we have some sort of democracy.
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:36.721]  But as you know, in the US, initially, only some people could vote and not other groups.
[01:25:36.741 --> 01:25:36.901]  Sure.
[01:25:36.941 --> 01:25:38.062]  So it's paradoxical.
[01:25:38.662 --> 01:25:41.862]  It creates incredible wealth and freedom, but it also creates spoiled brats.
[01:25:43.823 --> 01:25:44.023]  Yes.
[01:25:45.003 --> 01:25:52.064]  Every great civilization went down after they went through a phase of great prosperity.
[01:25:53.085 --> 01:25:54.165]  And usually,
[01:25:55.089 --> 01:26:10.934]  This period of great prosperity, like in Spain, after the discoveries of gold in Mexico and in nowadays Bolivia, Potosi, which incidentally became one of the largest cities in the world during the silver boom.
[01:26:11.914 --> 01:26:18.136]  But the thing is, these rich countries, then they also go and borrow money.
[01:26:19.096 --> 01:26:21.497]  So the debts expand and eventually
[01:26:22.304 --> 01:26:23.624]  They fail, they go bankrupt.
[01:26:23.785 --> 01:26:26.746]  Well, Mark Faber, this is fascinating and I'd love to get you on for a full hour.
[01:26:26.766 --> 01:26:27.786]  We've only got about two minutes left.
[01:26:27.826 --> 01:26:32.468]  You are a guy that's really predicted major economic developments with incredible accuracy.
[01:26:32.508 --> 01:26:37.249]  So, just briefly, without folks going to your site, they should go there, gloomboomdoom.com.
[01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:41.151]  What is your quick prognosis on the global economy versus the US?
[01:26:41.211 --> 01:26:45.152]  Can Trump turn the downward spiral off?
[01:26:48.073 --> 01:26:49.014]  In my view,
[01:26:50.643 --> 01:26:53.186]  We had a recovery post June 2009.
[01:26:54.287 --> 01:26:55.889]  The bull market began on March 6, 2009.
[01:26:58.492 --> 01:27:02.677]  Most of the expansion is driven by credit.
[01:27:03.177 --> 01:27:07.322]  The credit as a percent of the global economy has expanded.
[01:27:08.103 --> 01:27:10.646]  We have artificially low interest rates.
[01:27:10.966 --> 01:27:11.507]  Can you imagine?
[01:27:12.256 --> 01:27:20.199]  I went through the 87 crash that time in 87 interest rates on the 10 years Treasury had gone from 7 to 10%.
[01:27:21.099 --> 01:27:23.760]  So the bond market was not in a bubble stage.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.541]  In the year 2000, the 10 years Treasury went to 6.5%.
[01:27:27.581 --> 01:27:30.002]  In the year 2007, when the last crisis occurred, it was at 5.25%.
[01:27:30.042 --> 01:27:30.322]  Now we are 2.3%.
[01:27:38.277 --> 01:27:39.598]  Portuguese bonds.
[01:27:40.479 --> 01:27:41.760]  Can you believe they yield 2%?
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:47.224]  Spanish bonds 1.7% and so forth.
[01:27:48.145 --> 01:27:52.608]  So, I mean, we have a completely distorted money market.
[01:27:52.668 --> 01:28:00.334]  And some people, they say, well, I'm not going to put money at zero interest rates or next to zero interest rates in bonds.
[01:28:00.394 --> 01:28:01.115]  I buy stocks.
[01:28:01.575 --> 01:28:04.157]  I buy real estate or bitcoins.
[01:28:05.202 --> 01:28:08.043]  But it's going to end very badly.
[01:28:08.123 --> 01:28:10.524]  We are not in one bubble.
[01:28:10.804 --> 01:28:12.325]  We have multiple bubbles.
[01:28:12.345 --> 01:28:14.226]  No, no, I totally agree.
[01:28:14.266 --> 01:28:18.247]  And I like the fact that Trump's at least trying to get taxes cut for the general public and try to control spending.
[01:28:18.267 --> 01:28:21.289]  But I think, like Ron Paul says, you'll never be able to completely fix it.
[01:28:21.569 --> 01:28:23.189]  How long can the bubble sustain?
[01:28:25.930 --> 01:28:29.132]  With money printing, you can sustain it for a while.
[01:28:30.412 --> 01:28:32.353]  But you can't sustain it forever.
[01:28:33.073 --> 01:28:34.094]  And the longer
[01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:41.510]  Absolutely.
[01:28:41.530 --> 01:28:43.391]  So we're headed towards some big times here.
[01:28:43.992 --> 01:28:44.332]  Absolutely.
[01:28:44.352 --> 01:28:45.813]  That's why people need to batten down the hatches.
[01:28:45.833 --> 01:28:46.894]  Thank you, Dr. Mark Faber.
[01:28:47.454 --> 01:28:48.855]  Gloomboomdoom.com.
[01:28:48.895 --> 01:28:49.836]  Hope we'll come back soon.
[01:28:50.236 --> 01:28:52.998]  Well, that's a guy just giving you basic history, being called a racist for it.
[01:28:53.258 --> 01:28:53.778]  What a load of bull.
[01:28:53.798 --> 01:28:54.739]  We are on the march.
[01:28:55.179 --> 01:28:57.561]  The empire is on the run.

[01:30:06.739 --> 01:30:10.322]  I've got a very simple sales strategy.
[01:30:10.662 --> 01:30:11.583]  It's develop
[01:30:12.483 --> 01:30:17.387]  And sell products that I personally use for my family at affordable prices.
[01:30:17.447 --> 01:30:18.989]  Because I want you to get great results.
[01:30:19.589 --> 01:30:21.511]  And I want you to come back and keep buying the product.
[01:30:22.231 --> 01:30:24.853]  Because I follow the golden rule, treat others as you want to be treated.
[01:30:25.654 --> 01:30:34.121]  Now we have developed True Whey Protein from one of the top developers in the country, a private label, at an affordable price that is delicious.
[01:30:35.162 --> 01:30:36.083]  I put the whey in.
[01:30:37.364 --> 01:30:38.985]  And ours is the best for the price it is.
[01:30:39.065 --> 01:30:39.866]  It's high quality.
[01:30:41.434 --> 01:30:49.623]  With either strawberry or chocolate flavored bone broth that has obviously incredible benefits.
[01:30:51.425 --> 01:31:01.235]  And you mix this together and you put in some organic milk, you put in some strawberries, some blueberries, some cherries.
[01:31:01.816 --> 01:31:02.437]  It's amazing.
[01:31:03.752 --> 01:31:04.952]  And I've gotten spoiled with this.
[01:31:05.153 --> 01:31:06.153]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:31:06.653 --> 01:31:09.714]  The last six months we developed this product and I was testing it.
[01:31:10.374 --> 01:31:15.056]  The energy it gives me, the mill replacement, all of it has spoiled me.
[01:31:15.616 --> 01:31:17.337]  And you can add fruit to it if you want.
[01:31:18.537 --> 01:31:19.878]  You can add ice to it if you want.
[01:31:19.898 --> 01:31:19.958]  But...
[01:31:21.977 --> 01:31:27.201]  The True Whey Protein with the Caveman Formula together is simply incredible.
[01:31:28.101 --> 01:31:31.043]  And it's something that supports our broadcast so you can't lose.
[01:31:31.083 --> 01:31:42.651]  But I want people to experience what concentrated bone broth does with chaga, mushroom, and with the turmeric, and with the pea pollen, and then with the high-quality whey together.
[01:31:43.311 --> 01:31:43.892]  It's amazing.
[01:31:49.887 --> 01:31:51.548]  This is a true superfood.
[01:31:52.028 --> 01:31:56.170]  Of the 30 plus products we put out that are all great, this one is the most amazing.
[01:31:56.671 --> 01:32:01.313]  When it just comes to, I take this for breakfast, I'm not hungry till like 6, 7 at night.
[01:32:01.813 --> 01:32:02.814]  I have so much energy.
[01:32:03.754 --> 01:32:07.676]  But it spoiled me because I used to work out to not be overweight.
[01:32:07.877 --> 01:32:08.117]  Now,
[01:32:08.917 --> 01:32:10.239]  This has changed my whole life.
[01:32:10.999 --> 01:32:12.241]  Bone broth is so amazing.
[01:32:12.481 --> 01:32:14.843]  Mixed with high-quality whey, it's even more incredible.
[01:32:15.163 --> 01:32:19.087]  Mixed with some berries and some high-quality organic milk, it's delicious.
[01:32:19.868 --> 01:32:21.770]  It's all available at mfoolerstore.com.
[01:32:22.311 --> 01:32:24.273]  And you can't lose because of your support in the broadcast.

[01:33:05.284 --> 01:33:11.507]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.009 --> 01:33:23.332]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.073 --> 01:33:29.295]  I know you can see me now, here's a surprise.
[01:33:32.556 --> 01:33:38.400]  Those who are telling me to shut up, they told Hillary that a couple of months ago.
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:39.100]  You know what I tell them?
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:39.801]  Go to hell.
[01:33:40.361 --> 01:33:42.342]  I'm going to tell my story.
[01:33:42.703 --> 01:33:52.669]  I'm going to tell my story, George, because this is a story of a young girl who started in American politics at the age of nine, who continues to fight each and every week of her life.
[01:33:53.249 --> 01:33:57.632]  I went down to Virginia last week to kick off the canvassing campaign.
[01:33:58.052 --> 01:33:59.193]  Nobody paid me to do that.
[01:33:59.513 --> 01:34:02.195]  Nobody, nobody... I'm not on a payroll, George.
[01:34:02.315 --> 01:34:03.295]  I care about my country.
[01:34:03.315 --> 01:34:04.516]  I care about our democracy.
[01:34:05.516 --> 01:34:12.260]  And I say go to hell because why am I supposed to be the only person that is unable to tell my story?
[01:34:14.862 --> 01:34:15.282]  That's right.
[01:34:16.043 --> 01:34:19.225]  You're supposed to be in a cult when you're a Democrat.
[01:34:19.325 --> 01:34:23.007]  Coming up in the next hour, after the artist behind Gilbert joins us,
[01:34:24.551 --> 01:34:28.372]  We're going to play some excerpts from the 14-minute interview.
[01:34:29.212 --> 01:34:29.972]  Very powerful.
[01:34:30.032 --> 01:34:30.952]  I don't like Democrats.
[01:34:30.972 --> 01:34:32.012]  I don't like globalism.
[01:34:32.052 --> 01:34:33.273]  I don't like what they're trying to set up.
[01:34:33.793 --> 01:34:37.533]  I don't like the unions that sold out their own jobs to the NAFTA and GATT.
[01:34:38.714 --> 01:34:48.015]  But Brazil coming out, saying her book's dedicated to Seth Rich, and that his murders should basically be looked into, and that she feared for her life, and that Hillary stole the election.
[01:34:48.035 --> 01:34:50.556]  That's all true!
[01:34:52.492 --> 01:34:53.192]  And it's amazing.
[01:34:53.833 --> 01:35:08.620]  I want to take a few of your calls about the mass shooting in Texas, to get your perspective on it, and the fact that two good guys with guns took out the bad guy that went into the church, that was a small church meeting it turns out, not even the majority of the church, and basically shot everybody in there.
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.081]  And then finished his work and left.
[01:35:11.201 --> 01:35:12.822]  That's why out of 27, 28 people,
[01:35:15.737 --> 01:35:23.742]  Inside a church, please, please, please have a deacon or have an usher that's trusted and a good person with a firearm.
[01:35:23.782 --> 01:35:26.163]  Because globalists love to target churches.
[01:35:26.564 --> 01:35:27.824]  Islamists love to target.
[01:35:27.884 --> 01:35:30.586]  The Antifa folks have been calling for targeting it.
[01:35:31.146 --> 01:35:36.390]  If you're congressmen or women out, you know, on a baseball team or a softball team, you better have somebody armed as well.
[01:35:37.110 --> 01:35:39.091]  Because hashtag hunt Republicans.
[01:35:40.032 --> 01:35:41.833]  That's the season we live in.
[01:35:43.476 --> 01:35:44.516]  And that's what's going on.
[01:35:45.417 --> 01:36:12.627]  Now, as soon as we get Rob Dues' connection going from the site of the shooting in South Texas, while he gets that connection going, that's having some basic problems there from Sutherland, I wanted to just mention a story that I see in the news without looking,
[01:36:15.026 --> 01:36:15.466]  Every week.
[01:36:17.787 --> 01:36:24.770]  And I've seen this story for 22 plus years on air, reading the news.
[01:36:26.911 --> 01:36:31.012]  Now, this is from mainstream news.
[01:36:33.093 --> 01:36:38.395]  If you actually read medical news, or you read watchdog news, it's even more prolific.
[01:36:38.435 --> 01:36:42.317]  And that's what's so frustrating is, it's just like I remember
[01:36:43.379 --> 01:36:45.319]  Bernie having the nomination stolen from him.
[01:36:45.639 --> 01:36:48.620]  I don't need Donna Brazile a year and a half later to tell me I was there.
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:50.480]  We broke the news, we reported on it.
[01:36:52.061 --> 01:36:53.601]  But it's just vindication.
[01:36:56.781 --> 01:37:02.782]  I know Roger Stone talked to the President, and he said he was thinking about releasing it, and so we told you that, and sure enough the President did it.
[01:37:04.423 --> 01:37:05.963]  But the media said we were making that up.
[01:37:08.643 --> 01:37:11.044]  It's the lying they engage in, but here is
[01:37:14.710 --> 01:37:15.771]  The New York Times.
[01:37:17.672 --> 01:37:20.613]  Mumps makes a comeback even among the vaccinated.
[01:37:21.573 --> 01:37:30.158]  Now, again, how are you supposed to get the disease or get the pathogen if you've
[01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:32.630]  Already been vaccinated.
[01:37:32.650 --> 01:37:33.910]  That's not what they say.
[01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:37.031]  Arrest anyone who's not vaccinated, because they'll give it to you.
[01:37:37.311 --> 01:37:39.531]  So you're saying the vaccine doesn't protect you.
[01:37:39.731 --> 01:37:51.014]  Well, the inserts of most vaccines for human papillomavirus, Gardasil, or for measles, mumps, rubella, for the flu, says it's not proven to be safe or effective, and it's not proven to protect you.
[01:37:53.254 --> 01:37:55.394]  It's the biggest hoax ever.
[01:37:55.934 --> 01:37:58.135]  Are there some learned immunities you can get from vaccines?
[01:37:58.235 --> 01:37:58.835]  Absolutely!
[01:37:59.889 --> 01:38:04.672]  But they've got vaccine damage protection, but here they are saying, oh, it's made a comeback.
[01:38:04.692 --> 01:38:06.613]  They try to spin it because there's unvaccinated.
[01:38:06.974 --> 01:38:12.157]  But you actually studied the big MMR and whooping cough outbreaks that keep happening, especially in California and other areas?
[01:38:12.597 --> 01:38:19.722]  It's illegal aliens and or it's people that have had outbreaks who've been vaccinated, just like the shingles outbreaks.
[01:38:20.923 --> 01:38:21.523]  And here it is.
[01:38:21.983 --> 01:38:24.425]  Mumps is transmitted by droplets of saliva or mucus.
[01:38:24.845 --> 01:38:28.608]  It can be spread by coughing and sneezing, but also by sharing cups and close contact.
[01:38:30.336 --> 01:38:37.923]  Many of the recent outbreaks occurred in college dorms or among athletic teams, as happened with the Syracuse University men's, workers, women's lacrosse team.
[01:38:40.405 --> 01:38:43.227]  And they go on to say they're seeing it in people that are vaccinated.
[01:38:43.768 --> 01:38:48.772]  Mumps vaccine is now combined with measles, rubella vaccine, given to one in four.
[01:38:49.693 --> 01:38:54.277]  But the immunity waves over time, so their answer is, go get more inoculations right now.
[01:38:58.942 --> 01:39:02.624]  Now, we're going to get more into this, and I want to go to your phone calls as well.
[01:39:02.664 --> 01:39:07.106]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[01:39:07.747 --> 01:39:17.272]  If you want to see his prolific reports, they're on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:39:18.632 --> 01:39:25.016]  But just to give us a recap of what he's discovered and what he's seen briefly, is Rob Dew, Infowars News Reporter.
[01:39:26.792 --> 01:39:33.080]  A news director who hurried down there right after news of the shooting occurred with Travis Knight yesterday.
[01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:36.905]  You can follow him at DoozNews on Twitter.
[01:39:37.645 --> 01:39:44.173]  So Rob, just recapping what you've witnessed so far in tracking the path of the killer and more.
[01:39:44.514 --> 01:39:45.095]  What have you seen?
[01:39:46.530 --> 01:39:50.132]  Well, from where we're at now is the other side of the highway.
[01:39:50.152 --> 01:39:51.453]  This is actually the front of the church.
[01:39:51.473 --> 01:39:53.975]  You can see their little steeple up there.
[01:39:54.575 --> 01:39:56.836]  And in front of that, they've built a triage unit.
[01:39:56.856 --> 01:40:04.341]  They've pulled all of the bodies out of the church at this point, and they are transporting them to Bayard County, where they're going to be doing autopsies.
[01:40:04.761 --> 01:40:07.883]  The shooter was transported to Travis County.
[01:40:08.283 --> 01:40:10.725]  And they said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
[01:40:10.745 --> 01:40:13.967]  Now they said he had four guns in total that he purchased.
[01:40:14.427 --> 01:40:19.550]  And Alex, this is where, I was listening to the show earlier, this is where things are going to start getting wonky.
[01:40:19.570 --> 01:40:24.673]  Now the governor came out and said he tried to get a license to carry handguns in Texas and was denied.
[01:40:25.133 --> 01:40:32.698]  But the ATF officials are saying he purchased, and it was at a press conference earlier today, that he purchased two guns in Texas and two in Colorado.
[01:40:33.558 --> 01:40:39.581]  How did he do that if he was dishonorably discharged?
[01:40:39.601 --> 01:40:41.721]  You can't own a gun after you've done that, or you can't buy a gun.
[01:40:41.741 --> 01:40:43.822]  It is not the equivalent of a felony.
[01:40:59.188 --> 01:41:11.038]  So apparently there is something going on where you could be court-martialed, dishonorably discharged from the armed forces for bad conduct, for abuse of your wife and child, and still be able to get a handgun.
[01:41:11.058 --> 01:41:13.600]  So this might be something that they might look at here in the future.
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:22.207]  But it is interesting that the governor said, oh, he was trying to get a handgun license here in Texas, and he couldn't, yet they're saying he purchased two guns here in Texas.
[01:41:22.227 --> 01:41:24.429]  That means he tried to get a concealed carry, so now that's clear.
[01:41:24.889 --> 01:41:27.631]  Well, he's a classic SJW, a socialist,
[01:41:29.092 --> 01:41:29.993]  Anti-Christian.
[01:41:30.714 --> 01:41:31.214]  Atheist.
[01:41:32.335 --> 01:41:37.419]  We saw a shooter in South Carolina that all Christians were to blame, all whites were to blame for that according to the media.
[01:41:37.739 --> 01:41:47.247]  I'm not saying all atheists are to blame for this guy, but clearly he's got the cut of an SJW, he's wearing a black outfit, he's going to take out his second wife's family.
[01:41:48.728 --> 01:41:49.569]  What's your take on that?
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:53.463]  There's even creepier details that have come forth.
[01:41:53.503 --> 01:41:58.610]  He actually put on a mask with a skull on the front, Alex, and went in there to do this carnage.
[01:41:58.951 --> 01:42:04.898]  And yes, it was going after his estranged second wife's mother-in-law who attended this church.
[01:42:05.559 --> 01:42:20.031]  So, that's very disturbing, but of course, the story that we've been talking about is the good guy with a gun who stopped the carnage, and then the other hero, Johnny Langendorf, in his truck where they pursued the shooter until he ran off the road and then killed himself.
[01:42:20.071 --> 01:42:24.215]  Now, I've also heard reports that the shooter had a hostage inside his car.
[01:42:24.955 --> 01:42:29.121]  So I haven't heard much about that lately either, so I'm anxious to talk to some law enforcement about that.
[01:42:29.141 --> 01:42:31.785]  Well, I'm going to let you get back on the ground then and continue investigating.
[01:42:31.805 --> 01:42:36.091]  Of course, live reports throughout this broadcast, throughout the war room, coming up, though, in Shroyer and more.
[01:42:36.411 --> 01:42:38.374]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:42:38.414 --> 01:42:38.975]  Thank you, Rob Doe.
[01:42:41.598 --> 01:42:41.858]  You bet.
[01:42:41.878 --> 01:42:42.579]  Thank you so much.
[01:42:42.739 --> 01:42:45.240]  We'll be right back with your phone call straight ahead.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:46.120]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:42:46.561 --> 01:42:48.342]  And again, I say this every break, as it's true.
[01:42:48.642 --> 01:42:49.602]  They're trying to censor us.
[01:42:49.622 --> 01:42:50.563]  They're trying to block us.
[01:42:50.963 --> 01:42:57.626]  As we're exposing the globalists, it's more critical than ever to share those links from newswars.com and infowars.com.
[01:42:57.906 --> 01:42:58.867]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:58.907 --> 01:43:00.468]  Great job of the crew there in Sutherland.
[01:43:02.577 --> 01:43:11.259]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:43:11.319 --> 01:43:11.800]  That's right.
[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:16.861]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.

[01:43:31.425 --> 01:43:31.565]  Woo!
[01:43:31.625 --> 01:43:32.546]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:43:32.666 --> 01:43:41.252]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:43:41.392 --> 01:43:50.639]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:43:50.999 --> 01:43:54.321]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:43:54.441 --> 01:43:58.404]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:43:58.564 --> 01:43:59.405]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:44:36.112 --> 01:44:40.695]  So now you have babies prematurely aging because of all the toxins.

[01:47:05.841 --> 01:47:08.462]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.915 --> 01:47:34.542]  I don't want to brag, I just want folks to understand why the enemy hates us so much.
[01:47:35.422 --> 01:47:44.467]  Because if you're a globalist operative and you tune in, or you read our articles, or you watch the informational videos, you know, we know, where the bodies are buried.
[01:47:46.288 --> 01:47:49.510]  And we know how to bring down the globalists, we know how they're screwing people over.
[01:47:50.894 --> 01:48:08.427]  And we've been hammering since Trump got in office for him to use an executive order to just not let Obamacare loot Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and to kill the individual mandate with an executive order because Obamacare gave the president unilateral power because they thought Hillary was going to be getting in.
[01:48:09.187 --> 01:48:15.192]  So they transferred all these powers under law to the presidency and now Trump can use that to roll up their operation.
[01:48:16.653 --> 01:48:18.235]  Well, Rand Paul predicted it.
[01:48:18.295 --> 01:48:19.496]  We first wrote the stories.
[01:48:20.116 --> 01:48:21.358]  Dr. Corsi hammering it.
[01:48:22.279 --> 01:48:24.421]  It was picked up by the White House, I can tell you.
[01:48:25.742 --> 01:48:27.303]  Hand-delivered to the President repeatedly.
[01:48:28.328 --> 01:48:30.610]  No wonder the deep state doesn't want him getting our articles.
[01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:34.632]  Like pardoning Sheriff Arpaio, you name it.
[01:48:35.773 --> 01:48:36.393]  Here's the story.
[01:48:36.433 --> 01:48:39.215]  Washington Examiner up on Infowars.com right now.
[01:48:39.715 --> 01:48:42.958]  Trump readies executive order to repeal Obamacare mandate.
[01:48:43.378 --> 01:48:46.700]  Rand Paul predicted the president would dismantle Obamacare.
[01:48:47.481 --> 01:48:48.161]  And there it is.
[01:48:48.181 --> 01:48:51.023]  And that will get the economy going again in a big way.
[01:48:53.061 --> 01:48:58.305]  It's really amazing to watch Trump continue to deliver and to deliver and to deliver.
[01:48:58.886 --> 01:49:11.756]  Very briefly, we have a lot of specials that have to end, but I've been so busy news gathering and so busy dealing with family stuff that I'm the person that comes up with the specials and the deals and the things we're running.
[01:49:12.788 --> 01:49:21.951]  And so I'm trying to get it where I traffic cop it better with the ads that are on radio and the ads that are on TV and trying to get that streamlined.
[01:49:22.351 --> 01:49:33.454]  But my crew is so focused on news and information gathering that it's become a cattywampus jackknife.
[01:49:34.154 --> 01:49:35.615]  But you can take advantage of that.
[01:49:36.391 --> 01:49:47.545]  Because I'll tell you, Brain Force is about to sell out, and we're not going to get more until maybe next year, January, a month and a half from now or more, just because I didn't have them pull the ad.
[01:49:48.447 --> 01:49:49.588]  And I didn't cut new ads.
[01:49:49.728 --> 01:49:50.668]  I mean, it's just there.
[01:49:51.728 --> 01:49:59.072]  What has been pulled is X2 and a bunch of other stuff at 50% off, but Brain Force is still up there even though it was supposed to come down over a week ago.
[01:50:00.312 --> 01:50:03.313]  It's not like North Korea where folks just walk around right now when I say around here.
[01:50:03.353 --> 01:50:04.654]  I just say it and do it.
[01:50:04.674 --> 01:50:07.715]  I did have a few meetings, but I've got to replace it with new stuff.
[01:50:07.735 --> 01:50:11.257]  We've got DNA Force back in stock after almost four months of being gone.
[01:50:11.697 --> 01:50:12.277]  Biome Defense.
[01:50:12.297 --> 01:50:13.458]  They're both amazing products.
[01:50:13.478 --> 01:50:16.099]  They've changed my life, changed so many other people's lives.
[01:50:16.599 --> 01:50:17.059]  I don't know.
[01:50:38.886 --> 01:50:40.788]  And experience these products.
[01:50:41.289 --> 01:50:43.572]  So BrainForce is going to go today.
[01:50:43.652 --> 01:50:44.573]  I'm going to have meetings.
[01:50:45.053 --> 01:50:46.435]  I'm going to come up with the new specials.
[01:50:46.515 --> 01:50:47.496]  It's going to happen.
[01:50:48.057 --> 01:50:50.840]  And I'm going to get the studies and all of it.
[01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:52.282]  I'm going to do those ads.
[01:50:53.817 --> 01:50:54.958]  Or I'm not coming on air tomorrow.
[01:50:55.659 --> 01:50:58.982]  Because, I mean, it just comes down to execution.
[01:51:00.223 --> 01:51:05.728]  So, again, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:11.701]  And you know what?
[01:51:11.721 --> 01:51:12.301]  I just got it.
[01:51:12.722 --> 01:51:17.368]  I said, I want the approved, what I'm allowed to say about DNA Force, because I've been trying for a year.
[01:51:17.829 --> 01:51:18.189]  You know what?
[01:51:18.650 --> 01:51:20.412]  I pitched a fit and I just got it right now.
[01:51:20.432 --> 01:51:20.933]  Isn't that great?
[01:51:21.153 --> 01:51:22.414]  Let me read this to you right now.
[01:51:24.097 --> 01:51:27.141]  This is product DNA Force 120 CT.
[01:51:29.619 --> 01:51:30.859]  Help supports the heart.
[01:51:30.879 --> 01:51:33.900]  I mean, this is approved studies is a fact.
[01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:37.641]  BioPQQ helps protect the body and the brain against free radical damage.
[01:51:37.982 --> 01:51:41.463]  BioPQQ works synergistically with CoQ10.
[01:51:42.023 --> 01:51:50.205]  Recent studies show that BioPQQ in a dosage of DNA force can help prevent a reduction of brain function in aging adults.
[01:51:50.285 --> 01:51:50.705]  You hear that?
[01:51:51.065 --> 01:51:58.868]  Recent studies suggest that BioPQQ as a dosage of DNA force can promote memory, attention, and cognitive function in aging adults.
[01:51:59.928 --> 01:52:01.590]  Supports optimal mental health.
[01:52:01.710 --> 01:52:02.951]  Supports healthy skin.
[01:52:03.211 --> 01:52:05.493]  Supports heart and blood vessel health.
[01:52:05.794 --> 01:52:10.998]  Supports body's CoQ10 levels tend to start decreasing at age 20.
[01:52:11.459 --> 01:52:13.220]  CoQ10 is an antioxidant supplement.
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:16.683]  Supports heart health and promotes the promotion of energy in the body.
[01:52:17.003 --> 01:52:18.825]  Cleans out the mitochondria inside the cells.
[01:52:19.125 --> 01:52:20.747]  Promotes overall cardiovascular health.
[01:52:21.187 --> 01:52:22.348]  That's just one thing in there.
[01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:24.269]  That is just a small thing that it does.
[01:52:24.289 --> 01:52:24.489]  25% off.
[01:52:24.509 --> 01:52:26.610]  Other leading competitors aren't even as good, and they're $300 to $600.
[01:52:50.023 --> 01:52:53.205]  Ours is $112, 25% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:53.445 --> 01:52:58.947]  It's our most expensive product, and it's what you find similar formulas in high-end medical clinics that you get from doctors.
[01:53:00.088 --> 01:53:07.291]  All right, and again, I've got callers in Sweden, callers in Texas, callers in Georgia, callers all over the world.
[01:53:07.591 --> 01:53:15.355]  We're going to go to you right now about what you think happened and has been going on with the Texas situation.
[01:53:15.835 --> 01:53:17.336]  So let's go to Robin first.
[01:53:17.416 --> 01:53:19.277]  Robin, thanks for holding her on the air from Sweden.
[01:53:21.226 --> 01:53:21.706]  Hi Alex.
[01:53:22.526 --> 01:53:22.806]  Welcome.
[01:53:23.587 --> 01:53:24.507]  Long time listener.
[01:53:25.267 --> 01:53:26.187]  Big fan of your show.
[01:53:26.367 --> 01:53:28.128]  Thanks for putting up with me.
[01:53:28.828 --> 01:53:31.088]  I just want to say I'm really sorry about what happened.
[01:53:31.269 --> 01:53:32.189]  It's a tragedy.
[01:53:32.349 --> 01:53:34.029]  It's also disgusting.
[01:53:35.190 --> 01:53:37.230]  Unto men's history what happened there.
[01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:37.850]  Yes sir.
[01:53:38.830 --> 01:53:48.773]  And I just want to say that this whole thing if I as a Swede living on the countryside of northern Sweden can understand
[01:53:55.475 --> 01:53:56.896]  Sure, he's wearing black.
[01:53:57.517 --> 01:53:58.697]  He hates Christians.
[01:53:59.358 --> 01:54:00.799]  He loves Antifa.
[01:54:01.559 --> 01:54:03.061]  He goes and targets a church.
[01:54:03.121 --> 01:54:06.883]  I mean, clearly he hated his wife's family, but he also hated Christians.
[01:54:06.903 --> 01:54:08.765]  I mean, I think that's overwhelmingly clear.
[01:54:08.805 --> 01:54:09.225]  What do you think?
[01:54:10.914 --> 01:54:11.995]  Yeah, of course, of course.
[01:54:12.015 --> 01:54:17.939]  When they tried to pull this thing in Las Vegas, it didn't work to ban the guns.
[01:54:18.359 --> 01:54:20.561]  So what did they do?
[01:54:20.581 --> 01:54:22.742]  They shot up a bunch of Christians and things.
[01:54:23.062 --> 01:54:24.984]  Okay, now we've got the conservatives on our side.
[01:54:25.004 --> 01:54:26.345]  Now they're going to put down their arms.
[01:54:26.405 --> 01:54:30.347]  Now they're going to disarm themselves and just blaze themselves to us.
[01:54:31.728 --> 01:54:38.693]  Speaking of that, Sweden, you've got the Islamic right gangs and the government bringing ISIS fighters back, just like the UK is doing.
[01:54:40.693 --> 01:54:43.855]  They aren't only bringing them back, they're giving them money.
[01:54:44.255 --> 01:54:53.161]  They're giving them 13,000 Swedish kronor, that is about $600 a month to let them stay here.
[01:54:53.561 --> 01:54:57.023]  They can educate themselves, they can spread their propaganda and everything.
[01:54:57.463 --> 01:55:07.289]  But last week, a Swedish nationalist, he was 15, he was arrested by the authorities, took away from his family and everything.
[01:55:08.041 --> 01:55:09.862]  Yes, because he was a nationalist.
[01:55:09.922 --> 01:55:22.471]  And now he's the LWU, which stands for Law for Upholding Young Citizens in Custody.
[01:55:23.432 --> 01:55:25.193]  So it's been brought from his family.
[01:55:25.273 --> 01:55:25.874]  I saw that.
[01:55:26.194 --> 01:55:34.159]  So a 15 year old was kidnapped just because he didn't want to be in the EU and didn't want open borders and taken from his family for re-education.
[01:55:34.279 --> 01:55:34.780]  Exactly.
[01:55:35.842 --> 01:55:39.187]  Yes, and now he's locked up, basically.
[01:55:39.207 --> 01:55:43.133]  He's locked up in what you can call a juvenile prison.
[01:55:43.173 --> 01:55:45.716]  He's got the barbed wire, he's got everything.
[01:55:45.736 --> 01:55:49.442]  And he's going to be there for six months to two years.
[01:55:50.290 --> 01:55:51.630]  Without trial, without anything.
[01:55:51.670 --> 01:55:53.011]  Just because he's a nationalist.
[01:55:53.051 --> 01:55:54.771]  He's an alt-righter, as they call it.
[01:55:54.791 --> 01:55:59.412]  And what's crazy is it's gotten so normal in Germany and Sweden and other places that I even accept it.
[01:55:59.452 --> 01:56:04.553]  I saw the article about people being sent for re-education because they don't want to be part of the EU.
[01:56:04.893 --> 01:56:07.614]  Now they're threatening the EU army to invade countries to try to pull out.
[01:56:07.934 --> 01:56:08.794]  God bless you, Robin.
[01:56:08.814 --> 01:56:09.934]  Thanks for calling from Sweden.
[01:56:09.954 --> 01:56:11.615]  I really appreciate your call.
[01:56:12.355 --> 01:56:15.076]  Let's go ahead and go to Forrest in Texas.
[01:56:15.476 --> 01:56:16.336]  Forrest, thanks for holding.
[01:56:16.376 --> 01:56:16.816]  You're on the air.
[01:56:17.896 --> 01:56:24.121]  Yeah, I want to talk about all the mainstream media reaction to the anti-gun violence.
[01:56:24.601 --> 01:56:25.902]  Let me just say this.
[01:56:26.563 --> 01:56:30.366]  They're sociopathic psychopaths that they're not even in the morgue yet.
[01:56:30.871 --> 01:56:33.753]  And then they come out and they say, we gotta take your guns.
[01:56:33.793 --> 01:56:38.197]  And I'm seeing all these actors, and I can tell they don't have any real human emotion.
[01:56:38.597 --> 01:56:43.961]  It's like the left when they take over like the EPA or any type of organization like that.
[01:56:44.001 --> 01:56:45.342]  They don't actually help the environment.
[01:56:45.362 --> 01:56:48.705]  They just use it as a vehicle to control the native population.
[01:56:49.345 --> 01:56:50.786]  Yes, everything is about control.
[01:56:50.866 --> 01:56:52.127]  It's all about cold-blooded power.
[01:56:52.448 --> 01:56:54.949]  And you'll confront them and they laugh at you and say, of course it's about power.
[01:56:55.250 --> 01:56:56.691]  They're all about being sociopaths.
[01:56:57.782 --> 01:57:08.886]  Yeah, I'm so emotionally like angry right now because I, you know, these people were murdered in cold blood by an anarchist, a little pecker person that wants to hurt and murder.
[01:57:08.906 --> 01:57:22.271]  Can you imagine though being the spoiled rotten little thug that he got thrown out of the military for beating up his wife and baby and then now he just goes in like a little thug and kills a bunch of people at a Baptist church including children.
[01:57:22.451 --> 01:57:24.572]  What a big nasty bloated spoiled brat.
[01:57:25.692 --> 01:57:26.233]  He knows.
[01:57:26.633 --> 01:57:29.636]  He went in there thinking, like, I'm gonna murder these people.
[01:57:29.996 --> 01:57:31.377]  I'm such a little person.
[01:57:31.737 --> 01:57:35.240]  I gotta prove to the world that I'm a man, that I'm worth something in my life.
[01:57:35.521 --> 01:57:37.002]  This is the moment I get back.
[01:57:37.382 --> 01:57:38.623]  I mean, it's sociopathic.
[01:57:38.663 --> 01:57:42.327]  They're reaching for human emotions, and the only way they get it is on an adrenaline drive.
[01:57:42.347 --> 01:57:42.967]  Absolutely.
[01:57:42.987 --> 01:57:44.128]  That's really astute what you said.
[01:57:44.148 --> 01:57:47.911]  Psychopaths and sociopaths only get emotion when they're doing something that's really, really horrible.
[01:57:48.112 --> 01:57:50.554]  They're only living when they do something terrible.
[01:57:59.584 --> 01:58:06.613]  We're not going to stoop to the tactics of this authoritarian communist and fascist, funded by that dirtbag George Soros.
[01:58:06.713 --> 01:58:09.336]  The communists, they can't resist free stuff.
[01:58:09.857 --> 01:58:13.080]  You set up a booth, it says free stuff.
[01:58:13.501 --> 01:58:17.185]  We're going to keep our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, and the American way.
[01:58:17.205 --> 01:58:19.388]  But at the same time, we're not going to back down from
[01:58:27.927 --> 01:58:30.349]  What do I do if one of these libtards calls me a Nazi?
[01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:31.570]  That's easy.
[01:58:31.590 --> 01:58:35.874]  You just put a pacifier in his mouth.
[01:58:36.574 --> 01:58:41.639]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[01:58:42.059 --> 01:58:43.701]  One of these Antifa's get in my face.
[01:58:43.721 --> 01:58:49.245]  I'm gonna pull out my pocket constitution and stick it in his.
[01:58:52.608 --> 01:58:53.229]  Antifa?
[01:58:53.889 --> 01:58:54.530]  Never heard of him.
[01:58:56.167 --> 01:58:56.907]  Never heard of the guy.
[01:58:57.648 --> 01:59:02.889]  They're gonna lose on November 4th and every day after that because they're a bunch of meth-head pieces of crap.
[01:59:03.449 --> 01:59:09.191]  Dude, that's French for p***y. Holding our ground and not letting these bullies push us around.
[01:59:09.471 --> 01:59:10.832]  But not stooping to their level.
[01:59:11.903 --> 01:59:14.284]  We're gonna grab him by the antifa.
[01:59:14.964 --> 01:59:16.945]  So on November 4th, we gotta do a thing.
[01:59:16.985 --> 01:59:18.105]  A thing?
[01:59:18.126 --> 01:59:19.186]  Yeah, we're gonna do a thing.
[01:59:19.626 --> 01:59:22.527]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:59:22.927 --> 01:59:24.728]  We're winning that war thanks to you.
[01:59:25.208 --> 01:59:30.350]  And wearing t-shirts and InfoWars ball caps in public is one of the best ways to spread the word.
[01:59:30.651 --> 01:59:33.712]  The revolution starts now with you at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:00:20.413 --> 02:00:24.315]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:25.516 --> 02:00:30.178]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.318 --> 02:00:35.180]  There's a big story up on DrudgeReport.com from InfoWars.com.
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:37.441]  We played the video earlier, but it's amazing.
[02:00:37.461 --> 02:00:38.861]  Just talk about media deception.
[02:00:39.261 --> 02:00:40.602]  How they take everything and twist it.
[02:00:42.466 --> 02:00:49.871]  And it's the Prime Minister taking a few scoops out of the box for the koi, the goldfish, and then dumping the whole thing.
[02:00:50.891 --> 02:01:04.259]  And then Trump mimics him exactly, and CNN only cuts to the Prime Minister doing a few scoops, then Trump dumping the whole thing, and say how barbarous it is, editing and blowing up the video so you can't see that he mimicked the Prime Minister exactly.
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:09.722]  Of course, I just tweeted out and asked the question, you know, why is Trump in trouble for this?
[02:01:11.175 --> 02:01:13.658]  The Clintons literally feed people to the fishes.
[02:01:14.599 --> 02:01:21.827]  So a French news agency properly showed Trump mimicking the Prime Minister exactly, but not CNN.
[02:01:21.927 --> 02:01:24.029]  If you're a TV viewer, we're showing you this.
[02:01:24.630 --> 02:01:30.036]  CNN just showed the Prime Minister doing the two scoops out, then they zoomed in and blew it up.
[02:01:31.147 --> 02:01:58.107]  on CNN to make it look like Trump just lazily dumped it in and then the left went crazy and said look what a moron he's hurting the fish he doesn't know what he's doing he's hurting everybody now watch they blow it up right at the point where the Prime Minister dumps it all out so that it looks like Trump did the wrong thing this is how they deceive boom they blow it up
[02:01:59.127 --> 02:02:03.930]  And then show Trump dumping it out, taking every cultural gesture, everything there is, and turning it bad.
[02:02:04.290 --> 02:02:05.951]  Making culture itself evil.
[02:02:05.971 --> 02:02:06.891]  See, that was racist.
[02:02:07.232 --> 02:02:08.212]  That was politically incorrect.
[02:02:08.232 --> 02:02:08.852]  He dumped it.
[02:02:09.093 --> 02:02:14.376]  He was disrespectful, even though he copied the Prime Minister with total precision.
[02:02:14.396 --> 02:02:18.338]  I know I've been harping on this, but remember the little boy?
[02:02:18.358 --> 02:02:25.402]  He shakes his hands, spends more time with him in the wheelchair, then walks away, and the little boy reaches out, and they said, oh, he ignored the little boy and showed the edited video.
[02:02:26.411 --> 02:02:27.451]  This is how they deceive.
[02:02:27.471 --> 02:02:31.213]  Ethan in Georgia, then Brandon in Texas, and Sue in Kansas.
[02:02:31.293 --> 02:02:32.033]  Ethan, you're on the air.
[02:02:32.073 --> 02:02:32.433]  Go ahead.
[02:02:33.834 --> 02:02:34.554]  Hey, Alex.
[02:02:34.634 --> 02:02:36.075]  It's good to finally talk to you.
[02:02:36.215 --> 02:02:39.416]  I've been a listener for 10 years and a customer.
[02:02:40.317 --> 02:02:46.599]  I wanted to get the input on the summer when shooting.
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:53.782]  Well, um... Yes, sir?
[02:02:57.642 --> 02:02:58.442]  That's where it would not happen.
[02:02:58.482 --> 02:02:59.563]  He said he wanted to give input on the shooting.
[02:02:59.583 --> 02:03:00.343]  We did not hang up on you.
[02:03:00.363 --> 02:03:00.984]  Call back, sir.
[02:03:01.384 --> 02:03:02.224]  I want to get your input.
[02:03:02.284 --> 02:03:03.085]  Thank you for your support.
[02:03:03.585 --> 02:03:04.926]  And I mean, I know I say support us.
[02:03:04.946 --> 02:03:05.546]  They're out to get us.
[02:03:06.207 --> 02:03:07.147]  We are the tip of the spear.
[02:03:07.447 --> 02:03:08.248]  They are out to get us.
[02:03:08.268 --> 02:03:10.849]  So God bless you for your financial support, sir.
[02:03:11.650 --> 02:03:13.911]  Brandon in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:03:13.931 --> 02:03:14.311]  Go ahead.
[02:03:16.112 --> 02:03:16.512]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:16.913 --> 02:03:17.213]  Welcome.
[02:03:17.233 --> 02:03:17.513]  Go ahead.
[02:03:18.594 --> 02:03:18.894]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:18.914 --> 02:03:19.134]  Thank you.
[02:03:19.154 --> 02:03:20.155]  I had a little static right there.
[02:03:20.295 --> 02:03:25.938]  I just want to point out that yesterday is my son's birthday and today I'm
[02:03:26.573 --> 02:03:39.756]  I purchased my application for a license to carry, and I got on Facebook and I was talking to the person and whatnot, and Facebook, you know, they do that previous post from years past or whatever.
[02:03:39.776 --> 02:03:39.836]  Yes.
[02:03:41.157 --> 02:03:51.119]  And two years ago, yesterday, you guys posted about Disney, you know, trying to make Christians surrender their firearms in a documentary called The Armor of Light.
[02:03:52.423 --> 02:04:03.587]  Oh, I remember the documentary, The Armored of Light, how it's Christian for us to turn our guns in and just let them come and kill us, even though that's anti-biblical, where Christ said, sell your garment and buy a sword in the Garden of Gethsemane.
[02:04:04.748 --> 02:04:05.188]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:05.228 --> 02:04:07.028]  That was two years ago, yesterday.
[02:04:08.429 --> 02:04:08.689]  Wow.
[02:04:08.769 --> 02:04:12.350]  What do you make of it being the day after the big SJW call for violence?
[02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:16.592]  Because, obviously, they can't attack on Sunday, I mean, on Saturday, because people aren't going to church.
[02:04:20.461 --> 02:04:25.326]  I'm trying to keep myself composed because it's my state, our state, home.
[02:04:25.406 --> 02:04:26.147]  We've been through a lot.
[02:04:27.849 --> 02:04:31.072]  Well, he was a leftist little dirtbag.
[02:04:33.054 --> 02:04:34.195]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:34.296 --> 02:04:37.319]  I'm getting my CHL this Saturday.
[02:04:38.769 --> 02:04:39.970]  Well, that is the answer.
[02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:43.032]  I'm surprised in a little church somebody wasn't packing.
[02:04:43.052 --> 02:04:44.893]  But hey, that's not their job to do that.
[02:04:44.933 --> 02:04:46.174]  I'm very sorry they got victimized.
[02:04:46.214 --> 02:04:48.735]  But Christians are the target of these devils.
[02:04:49.396 --> 02:04:52.378]  So we've got to be offensively very, very peaceful.
[02:04:52.418 --> 02:04:55.880]  But defensively, we need to be ready to defend ourselves.
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:57.481]  I pack all the time now.
[02:04:57.821 --> 02:04:58.602]  You have to do it.
[02:04:58.662 --> 02:04:59.822]  Didn't start doing it until a year ago.
[02:05:00.183 --> 02:05:00.903]  You must do it.
[02:05:00.943 --> 02:05:01.484]  Thank you, Brandon.
[02:05:01.504 --> 02:05:01.944]  God bless you.
[02:05:03.769 --> 02:05:05.691]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[02:05:05.751 --> 02:05:06.811]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:05:07.072 --> 02:05:07.992]  Why is this so good?
[02:05:08.293 --> 02:05:13.537]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:05:13.597 --> 02:05:27.167]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:05:27.227 --> 02:05:28.609]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:05:29.369 --> 02:05:30.950]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:33.513]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:05:33.613 --> 02:05:34.874]  These are all parasites.
[02:05:34.914 --> 02:05:36.015]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:05:36.035 --> 02:05:37.075]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:05:37.376 --> 02:05:41.699]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:05:41.899 --> 02:05:45.082]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:05:45.182 --> 02:05:48.243]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:05:48.263 --> 02:05:49.283]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:05:49.323 --> 02:05:51.204]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:51.264 --> 02:05:52.284]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:05:52.304 --> 02:05:54.385]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:05:55.005 --> 02:05:58.026]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:58.287 --> 02:06:00.187]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:06:00.567 --> 02:06:02.548]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:06:10.211 --> 02:06:10.851]  Big Brother.
[02:06:12.305 --> 02:06:13.566]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:15.068 --> 02:06:16.189]  Government cover-ups.
[02:06:17.690 --> 02:06:18.631]  You want answers?
[02:06:19.592 --> 02:06:20.573]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:21.514 --> 02:06:27.799]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:31.953 --> 02:06:39.259]  All right, for the next 45 minutes or so, Scott Adams, the creator of one of the top comic strips in history, Dilbert, is joining us.
[02:06:39.279 --> 02:06:44.543]  But he's also somebody that studies persuasion, somebody that studies politics history.
[02:06:44.904 --> 02:06:45.584]  Really smart guy.
[02:06:45.604 --> 02:06:47.526]  We're really excited to have him joining us here in just a moment.
[02:06:47.826 --> 02:06:53.431]  In the last 15 minutes or so, I'll take more calls from people that are patiently holding, like Sue, Faith, Tal, Brian, and others.
[02:06:53.491 --> 02:06:55.132]  If not, you can hang up and call back if you'd like.
[02:06:55.632 --> 02:07:00.576]  And then we're going to have Matt Dubiel co-hosting with me in the fourth hour from our Chicago affiliate.
[02:07:01.465 --> 02:07:02.906]  Covering a whole bunch of big developments.
[02:07:03.266 --> 02:07:09.889]  But first, it was such a fascinating interview that I wanted to play some more excerpts of it.
[02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:19.013]  Because Donna Brazile has come out and said that she talked about removing Hillary from the nomination.
[02:07:20.053 --> 02:07:23.115]  That Hillary stole the nomination from Bernie Sanders.
[02:07:24.574 --> 02:07:25.775]  And that you can go to hell.
[02:07:26.335 --> 02:07:28.997]  She says, I will not shut up.
[02:07:29.017 --> 02:07:31.039]  This is on ABC's This Week.
[02:07:31.119 --> 02:07:32.740]  Now this is bigger than just Donna Brazile.
[02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:34.281]  I don't just believe Donna Brazile.
[02:07:34.821 --> 02:07:38.043]  I know everything she basically talked about, we covered at the time.
[02:07:38.464 --> 02:07:39.645]  So it's true what she's saying.
[02:07:40.405 --> 02:07:49.914]  Including, she feared for her life with the whole Seth Rich thing, which they were trying to cover up, they were so desperate, and that Hillary ordered them to not let the FBI into the servers that were being hacked into.
[02:07:50.555 --> 02:07:52.977]  This completely blows up in the face of Robert Mueller.
[02:07:53.177 --> 02:07:57.441]  So here's a short compilation of some of the highlights, and then we're going to go to our guest.
[02:07:57.701 --> 02:08:05.008]  Here is Donna Brazile, one of the chief rats, former head of the DNC, leaving the sinking ship.
[02:08:05.048 --> 02:08:05.468]  Here it is.
[02:08:06.329 --> 02:08:10.231]  It sounds like you had a pretty dysfunctional relationship with the High Command and Hillary's campaign.
[02:08:10.251 --> 02:08:13.873]  You even talk about telling them at some point, I'm not Patsy the Slave.
[02:08:14.093 --> 02:08:23.819]  Yeah, I'm not Patsy the Slave because I got sick and tired of people telling me how to spend money when all I was trying to do, I wasn't getting a salary, I was basically volunteering my time.
[02:08:24.079 --> 02:08:31.485]  And what I was trying to do, George, was to increase the level of enthusiasm and passion for Hillary Clinton and the rest of the ticket all across the country.
[02:08:31.505 --> 02:08:32.686]  But here's what they don't know.
[02:08:33.046 --> 02:08:36.208]  They don't know what it was like to be over at the DNC during this hacking.
[02:08:36.489 --> 02:08:38.430]  They don't know what it's like to bury a child.
[02:08:38.490 --> 02:08:39.411]  I did, Seth Rich.
[02:08:39.471 --> 02:08:43.494]  They don't know what it's like to protect the staff from further harassment.
[02:08:43.754 --> 02:08:47.277]  They don't know what it's like because the high command of Brooklyn
[02:08:47.617 --> 02:08:52.178]  The people who were making the decisions, even for the DNC, they didn't come and work with us.
[02:08:52.478 --> 02:08:56.279]  They told us to shut up and basically let them win the election.
[02:08:56.299 --> 02:09:01.861]  And when we tried to intervene, we had to spend money we raised to try to help them win.
[02:09:01.941 --> 02:09:04.002]  And that was my job as chair of the party.
[02:09:04.202 --> 02:09:08.023]  George, for those who are telling me to shut up, they told Hillary that a couple of months ago.
[02:09:08.043 --> 02:09:08.823]  You know what I tell them?
[02:09:08.843 --> 02:09:09.423]  Go to hell.
[02:09:10.003 --> 02:09:12.004]  I'm going to tell my story.
[02:09:12.024 --> 02:09:14.905]  You just mentioned Seth Rich, who of course was killed during the campaign.
[02:09:14.925 --> 02:09:16.065]  Did you feel under threat?
[02:09:17.054 --> 02:09:17.474]  Every day.
[02:09:17.494 --> 02:09:20.315]  Do you agree with Elizabeth Warren that the primaries were rigged?
[02:09:20.756 --> 02:09:23.937]  I don't think she meant the word rigged.
[02:09:23.997 --> 02:09:31.000]  Because what I said, George, as you well know, after I left this show back on July 24th, I said I would get to the bottom of everything.
[02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:31.941]  And that's what I did.
[02:09:31.981 --> 02:09:36.783]  And I called Senator Sanders to say, you know, I wanted to make sure there was no rigging in the process.
[02:09:36.843 --> 02:09:38.223]  I'm on the Rules and Bylaws Committee.
[02:09:38.323 --> 02:09:39.544]  I found no evidence.
[02:09:40.084 --> 02:09:41.005]  None whatsoever.
[02:09:41.245 --> 02:09:42.505]  I knew I sent emails.
[02:09:42.625 --> 02:09:43.206]  Of course, George.
[02:09:43.226 --> 02:09:44.786]  So you're not denying that you sent this email?
[02:09:46.647 --> 02:09:47.027]  I'm not.
[02:09:47.688 --> 02:09:53.110]  First of all, I said, straight up, I said, look, if this was sent, I know why I sent it.
[02:09:53.230 --> 02:09:54.751]  I apologize.
[02:09:55.171 --> 02:10:00.614]  I spent the entire month of August apologizing for the leetagged emails, which is a crime.
[02:10:01.334 --> 02:10:01.614]  All right.
[02:10:02.315 --> 02:10:05.056]  So that is a rat leaving the sinking ship.
[02:10:06.325 --> 02:10:09.646]  Now joining us is Scott Adams, blog.dilbert.com.
[02:10:09.666 --> 02:10:11.087]  Don't have to tell you everything about him.
[02:10:11.927 --> 02:10:20.330]  He predicted Trump would win before anybody else did, other than maybe us, and that he would win the nomination in the general election.
[02:10:20.890 --> 02:10:22.931]  He endorsed Hillary Clinton for his personal safety.
[02:10:23.351 --> 02:10:26.972]  You've seen me get hot coffee thrown on me and more, so it's a little bit tongue-in-cheek there.
[02:10:27.913 --> 02:10:38.204]  And he goes on to say that writing about Donald Trump ended my speaking career and has already reduced my income about 40% as far as I can tell, but I'm in less physical danger than I was.
[02:10:38.265 --> 02:10:43.811]  So he's paid a lot to promote the American way of life, a fellow thought criminal, Scott Adams of Dilbert.
[02:10:44.091 --> 02:10:44.872]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:10:46.034 --> 02:10:46.754]  Thanks for having me.
[02:10:47.697 --> 02:10:48.578]  Where should we start?
[02:10:48.618 --> 02:10:53.222]  I mean, I want to get into more predictions and why you predicted Trump would win and so much more.
[02:10:53.242 --> 02:10:59.707]  But what do you think of the Democrats, from Wolf Blitzer to Donna Brazile, throwing Hillary under the bus?
[02:10:59.747 --> 02:11:04.171]  I think that shows that Obama and the party know that as a poster child, Hillary's killing them.
[02:11:05.564 --> 02:11:18.288]  Yeah, they're really going to need to reinvent themselves, because I think they realize that the last horse they rode didn't get them that far, and if they keep riding that horse, it's not going to work too much.
[02:11:19.029 --> 02:11:25.391]  I was reading today that the Democrats are thinking about getting more of an economic message next time.
[02:11:25.991 --> 02:11:34.940]  And I thought to myself, how is that going to work if we have GDP of 4% and record low unemployment by the time the 2018 election comes around?
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:38.483]  It seems like they're being herded into a narrow ravine.
[02:11:38.603 --> 02:11:42.687]  It's like the worst place they could possibly be, assuming the economy stays strong.
[02:11:44.514 --> 02:11:48.155]  Wow, that's really boiled down when you put it that way.
[02:11:49.375 --> 02:11:52.076]  The saying, a day late, a dollar short, just doesn't go far enough.
[02:11:52.396 --> 02:11:56.737]  They only seem to now know that they're turning their party into a coastal elite party.
[02:11:57.017 --> 02:11:59.817]  What they said was about to happen to the Republicans is happening to them.
[02:12:01.758 --> 02:12:06.299]  Yeah, their old technique of identity politics didn't work.
[02:12:07.137 --> 02:12:16.150]  And their new approach seems just even on the surface like it couldn't possibly work unless they know something we know about some downturn between now and 2018.
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:27.530]  But how long can the bullying, the intimidation, the calling everybody KKK members that don't want to be socialist or don't want to live under Hillary Clinton, how long can that work?
[02:12:27.550 --> 02:12:35.579]  Because they've really, as you know, been pressing and getting more and more vicious, more and more threatening, and it seems to be actually making people get madder who are even Democrats.
[02:12:35.599 --> 02:12:36.921]  It seems to be blowing up in their face.
[02:12:38.075 --> 02:12:46.339]  Yeah, you know, both sides do the trick where you try to characterize the entire other party by their worst 20% or 10%.
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:52.382]  I don't see that ever changing because it sort of works, you know, and people keep doing what works.
[02:12:53.022 --> 02:13:06.569]  But it does seem to me that the Republicans are sort of becoming the party that loves the Constitution and the rule of law, and the Democrats are sort of accidentally becoming the party that just hates other people.
[02:13:06.969 --> 02:13:08.871]  Exactly, exactly, exactly.
[02:13:08.952 --> 02:13:13.016]  It seems the Republicans are reforming themselves, getting back to American roots.
[02:13:13.236 --> 02:13:14.298]  They've been incredibly corrupt.
[02:13:14.578 --> 02:13:20.625]  And the Democrats are just getting more extreme, more bullying in an attempt to hang on, only making people hate them that much more.
[02:13:21.949 --> 02:13:30.133]  Yeah, and I think it's exacerbated by what I call the massive cluster bomb of cognitive dissonance that happened on election day.
[02:13:30.773 --> 02:13:40.778]  So on election day, about half the country believed that they were smart and wise and kind and many other good things about themselves, and their candidate would surely win.
[02:13:40.978 --> 02:13:45.300]  And there was no way in the world that this Donald Trump character could become president.
[02:13:46.180 --> 02:13:47.681]  And on election night,
[02:13:48.382 --> 02:13:56.507]  They realized that some of the most fundamental things they've ever believed are just completely wrong, and they had to reinterpret their entire world.
[02:13:57.027 --> 02:14:02.231]  And so I think many of them reinterpreted it, not as, gosh, I guess I was under-informed.
[02:14:02.631 --> 02:14:04.572]  Maybe I haven't talked to enough Republicans.
[02:14:04.972 --> 02:14:06.694]  Maybe I've missed the entire story.
[02:14:07.054 --> 02:14:08.635]  Maybe I've ignored the middle class.
[02:14:08.695 --> 02:14:15.059]  I mean, all the things they could have said to themselves about why the result came out differently than they imagined, I don't think they did.
[02:14:15.079 --> 02:14:16.620]  I think what they decided was,
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:20.482]  Well, the other side must be far worse than I ever imagined.
[02:14:20.883 --> 02:14:25.846]  There are far more terrible racists who are supporting this monster for president.
[02:14:26.346 --> 02:14:31.669]  So they had to come up with a story that kept their original worldview at least mostly intact.
[02:14:32.130 --> 02:14:41.836]  And so in that worldview, not only were they right all along, they were right in the right direction, but it was even worse than they thought, which is a lot like being right.
[02:14:42.751 --> 02:14:48.018]  So I think that's the spontaneous hallucination that people are dealing with.
[02:14:48.378 --> 02:14:50.361]  And I mean hallucination in the literal sense.
[02:14:51.362 --> 02:14:58.351]  It seems to me, and fact check me on this because you've been following politics longer and more closely than I have really.
[02:14:58.411 --> 02:15:00.594]  I've just sort of been getting into it in the last couple of years.
[02:15:02.212 --> 02:15:12.375]  But it seems to me that in the old days, people used to just sort of lie about the other side and stretch the truth, but they knew they were doing it.
[02:15:12.895 --> 02:15:15.356]  It seemed to me there was an awareness there.
[02:15:15.716 --> 02:15:19.897]  Yeah, I'm just going to say something about the other side because this will be a good strategy.
[02:15:20.537 --> 02:15:26.319]  But now it seems, and this is my observation subject to, you know, anybody else's opinion on it,
[02:15:27.231 --> 02:15:31.233]  Um, it seems that they actually believe what they're saying this time.
[02:15:31.713 --> 02:15:34.635]  Like, they actually believe there's a monster in the White House.
[02:15:34.675 --> 02:15:36.295]  Well, you said it better than anybody ever heard.
[02:15:36.475 --> 02:15:43.479]  They smoked their own dope, and in the process of self-fulfilling prophecy, they became the monsters that they were projecting onto us.
[02:15:44.878 --> 02:15:46.901]  Yeah, and I don't think that they realize that at all.
[02:15:47.042 --> 02:15:51.449]  I think that in their minds, if you're fighting Hitler, in their minds that's what they're doing.
[02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:54.153]  Then whatever you do is justified.
[02:15:54.173 --> 02:15:56.036]  So I think that's their moral cover.
[02:15:56.156 --> 02:15:56.477]  Wow!
[02:15:56.757 --> 02:15:57.418]  I gotta say!
[02:15:58.971 --> 02:16:07.314]  This guy right here just crystallizes so much better than I can... We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[02:16:07.795 --> 02:16:12.837]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[02:16:13.377 --> 02:16:17.298]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[02:16:17.318 --> 02:16:20.620]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:25.741]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[02:16:26.381 --> 02:16:29.642]  It's you, the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[02:16:30.323 --> 02:16:38.045]  I came in here an hour ago, and I literally just went to Infowarsstore.com and printed the five-star reviews.
[02:16:38.965 --> 02:16:39.846]  The first few pages.
[02:16:40.147 --> 02:16:43.951]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[02:16:44.552 --> 02:16:48.036]  And it's five-star after five-star after five-star.
[02:16:48.376 --> 02:16:50.078]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[02:16:50.539 --> 02:16:56.866]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:16:56.906 --> 02:16:57.807]  Let's go over them right now.
[02:16:58.348 --> 02:17:02.994]  This is Verified Buyer Mark, five-star review for Anthroplex for men and women.
[02:17:03.495 --> 02:17:15.410]  I take it as directed, as is one uses it too much it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[02:17:15.991 --> 02:17:16.671]  Easy does it.
[02:17:16.751 --> 02:17:17.752]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[02:17:17.772 --> 02:17:18.732]  It's very, very serious.
[02:17:19.132 --> 02:17:19.553]  Not a game.
[02:17:19.573 --> 02:17:20.033]  Thank you, Mark.
[02:17:20.493 --> 02:17:21.793]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[02:17:21.934 --> 02:17:22.714]  Energy all day.
[02:17:22.734 --> 02:17:30.457]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[02:17:30.897 --> 02:17:31.597]  Another review.
[02:17:31.617 --> 02:17:32.618]  I love this one.
[02:17:32.918 --> 02:17:35.359]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[02:17:35.739 --> 02:17:39.261]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[02:17:39.541 --> 02:17:42.462]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[02:17:42.842 --> 02:17:44.384]  Here's another one ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:44.765 --> 02:17:48.129]  Five star review for Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[02:17:48.409 --> 02:17:51.593]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[02:17:51.653 --> 02:17:52.354]  I don't get sick.
[02:17:53.035 --> 02:17:56.379]  Last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[02:17:56.519 --> 02:17:57.500]  Amazing product.
[02:17:58.221 --> 02:18:00.302]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[02:18:00.722 --> 02:18:01.742]  Here's one from Brian.
[02:18:02.042 --> 02:18:04.122]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[02:18:04.242 --> 02:18:05.083]  Thank you all.
[02:18:05.483 --> 02:18:09.124]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[02:18:09.204 --> 02:18:11.404]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[02:18:11.804 --> 02:18:13.765]  Every night owl should have this product.
[02:18:14.245 --> 02:18:17.706]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[02:18:17.946 --> 02:18:18.606]  And I should add,
[02:18:19.406 --> 02:18:20.527]  That's a great name for this product.
[02:18:20.787 --> 02:18:22.608]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[02:18:22.628 --> 02:18:24.349]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[02:18:24.690 --> 02:18:26.011]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[02:18:26.111 --> 02:18:27.712]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[02:18:27.752 --> 02:18:28.292]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[02:18:28.552 --> 02:18:29.313]  I said I'd shut up!
[02:18:30.213 --> 02:18:30.974]  But back to the script.
[02:18:31.334 --> 02:18:33.215]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[02:18:33.255 --> 02:18:33.976]  I love that name too.
[02:18:34.416 --> 02:18:36.458]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[02:18:36.758 --> 02:18:40.941]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[02:18:40.981 --> 02:18:43.562]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[02:18:43.622 --> 02:18:45.043]  You make it literally possible.
[02:18:46.104 --> 02:18:50.910]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million, colloidal silver out there.
[02:18:51.430 --> 02:18:54.273]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[02:18:54.554 --> 02:18:58.118]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[02:18:58.638 --> 02:19:00.841]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be though.
[02:19:01.842 --> 02:19:04.343]  I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[02:19:04.683 --> 02:19:06.785]  This was the first product I purchased from Inforestore.
[02:19:07.125 --> 02:19:12.989]  Whenever I feel the first hazes of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[02:19:13.409 --> 02:19:19.153]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015 and it's worked for everyone.
[02:19:19.633 --> 02:19:26.038]  It has become an expected gift for our family and that's why we get you the best products because we want to repeat customers.
[02:19:26.278 --> 02:19:27.098]  It's all a win-win.
[02:19:27.259 --> 02:19:28.159]  That's an awesome review.
[02:19:28.199 --> 02:19:30.981]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family.
[02:19:31.421 --> 02:19:33.462]  Well, I got 20 seconds left, folks.
[02:19:33.522 --> 02:19:36.483]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Caveman reviews.
[02:19:36.523 --> 02:19:37.683]  They're all five-star.
[02:19:37.943 --> 02:19:47.226]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout, taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[02:19:47.506 --> 02:19:49.307]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[02:19:49.607 --> 02:19:53.128]  Find it all, folks, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:19:53.168 --> 02:19:58.290]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[02:20:05.225 --> 02:20:07.967]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.299 --> 02:20:25.841]  This is our land.
[02:20:28.943 --> 02:20:32.225]  These are our people.
[02:20:32.265 --> 02:20:32.926]  The workers.
[02:20:34.087 --> 02:20:39.168]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:21:04.033 --> 02:21:06.694]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:21:07.894 --> 02:21:10.835]  Alright folks, I've seen him on other television programs.
[02:21:10.855 --> 02:21:13.455]  He's been on with us once before, about a year ago.
[02:21:14.416 --> 02:21:16.716]  And I gotta say, I am really impressed.
[02:21:16.856 --> 02:21:22.138]  Not just with Dilbert over the years, I've been reading it for decades, but with the way he boils it down.
[02:21:22.178 --> 02:21:25.779]  You know it's true when you hear it, especially when you've experienced it.
[02:21:26.319 --> 02:21:31.420]  And then what's even crazier is, you don't hear what he's saying almost anywhere else, even here.
[02:21:33.063 --> 02:21:35.084]  Because I was never even a Republican or a Democrat.
[02:21:35.104 --> 02:21:35.884]  I've been a Libertarian.
[02:21:36.324 --> 02:21:37.925]  And the Republicans have horrible problems.
[02:21:37.985 --> 02:21:40.266]  But the populists have been taking that over.
[02:21:41.026 --> 02:21:44.968]  Most of the folks I knew that put Trump into office were the old Obama voters.
[02:21:45.008 --> 02:21:46.229]  In fact, the demographics showed it.
[02:21:46.849 --> 02:21:55.673]  But now, they've gone so crazy that they've radicalized to the point of where they've just dehumanized everyone out there.
[02:21:56.974 --> 02:22:01.136]  Just like that passage from 1984, we just played as we came in live.
[02:22:01.376 --> 02:22:14.804]  So I'm going to ask him to recap what he just said and then expand on it and then predict again, you know, as a linguist, as somebody that's written and studied the art of persuasion and made a lot of accurate prediction.
[02:22:15.544 --> 02:22:19.748]  That's where he thinks this is going as a best-selling author and researcher.
[02:22:19.988 --> 02:22:21.890]  Again, the creator of Dilbert, Scott Adams.
[02:22:21.930 --> 02:22:25.673]  Because, again, folks know, I don't just say, hey, that's profound all the time.
[02:22:25.873 --> 02:22:27.034]  I think everybody understands.
[02:22:27.054 --> 02:22:28.376]  We heard the truth there.
[02:22:28.776 --> 02:22:32.019]  So looking at this mass mental illness, where does it go next?
[02:22:32.099 --> 02:22:35.862]  And how do we not become so radicalized by fighting it?
[02:22:36.203 --> 02:22:39.646]  Because when you're faced with the abyss, as Nietzsche said, you tend to become the abyss.
[02:22:41.147 --> 02:22:41.367]  Right.
[02:22:41.667 --> 02:22:45.949]  Um, well, first of all, I I've got, uh, it all does a big book.
[02:22:46.329 --> 02:22:47.150]  Yeah.
[02:22:48.430 --> 02:22:58.714]  So it's when Bigley and it's, uh, the story of, uh, uh, how persuasion in a world where effects don't matter is everything you need to understand what happened in the last two years.
[02:22:59.454 --> 02:23:05.437]  So I'm, I'm a trained hypnotist by background and been studying persuasion and all his, all his forms.
[02:23:06.195 --> 02:23:06.675]  For years.
[02:23:06.795 --> 02:23:13.079]  And so when I looked at the election cycle, I was looking at it through a different window, just looking at it through a persuasion window.
[02:23:13.759 --> 02:23:22.965]  And one of the things that you learn to look for when you're when you have this kind of a background is you look for what I'd call the trigger for cognitive dissonance.
[02:23:23.165 --> 02:23:28.608]  It's the it's the thing that caused people to flip out and become irrational, a specific thing.
[02:23:29.208 --> 02:23:40.416]  And the specific thing was the election itself, when most of the world thought they understood the world, and surely this Donald Trump character could never be elected president, and then he was.
[02:23:40.836 --> 02:23:53.005]  And they had to suddenly reinterpret their world to make sense of it, without changing the basic thing that they wanted to maintain, which is, well, I've been right all along, I'm a pretty smart person, so whatever is going on here,
[02:23:53.786 --> 02:23:56.633]  It must be something that I'm still right about.
[02:23:56.753 --> 02:23:58.397]  That's the way normal brains work, by the way.
[02:23:58.738 --> 02:24:00.482]  So I'm not mocking Democrats with this.
[02:24:00.903 --> 02:24:02.607]  This is a normal way things work.
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:13.328]  Now, the reason it would affect the Democrats more than the Republicans in this specific case is that the Republicans got what they wanted and expected, which was a President Trump overall.
[02:24:13.948 --> 02:24:18.351]  The Democrats got nothing they wanted, and they certainly didn't expect it.
[02:24:18.732 --> 02:24:22.154]  So that was a perfect setup for a trigger for cognitive dissonance.
[02:24:22.655 --> 02:24:32.422]  Now, the other way you could confirm that that's what's happening, as opposed to people having reasonable opinions, is you look for the oversized reaction.
[02:24:33.012 --> 02:24:48.281]  The reaction that if you brought in a third-party observer who hadn't been watching any of the election and just said to him, hey, could you look at this person and tell me, do you think this reaction, the size of their emotional reaction, does this seem normal to you?
[02:24:49.122 --> 02:24:54.925]  Or have people organized to literally go outside and scream at the sky?
[02:24:56.086 --> 02:24:57.767]  Actually, that's actually what's happening.
[02:24:58.243 --> 02:24:59.964]  That people are screaming at the sky.
[02:25:00.344 --> 02:25:01.525]  They're putting masks on.
[02:25:01.545 --> 02:25:06.368]  You know, I feel sorry for poor Rand Paul.
[02:25:06.889 --> 02:25:13.153]  You know, he's been I think the victim of possibly two attempted murders in one year.
[02:25:13.757 --> 02:25:17.579]  And I would think that one of them for sure was politically motivated.
[02:25:18.259 --> 02:25:20.860]  And the other one, I've got my suspicions, right?
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:23.481]  There may have been a political motive to that.
[02:25:23.501 --> 02:25:27.583]  And now he has five broken ribs, a pierced lung, and is in serious condition.
[02:25:29.276 --> 02:25:36.838]  Yeah, add that on top of Trump supporters during the election who were beaten in just San Jose, you know, a short drive from where I live.
[02:25:37.498 --> 02:25:48.982]  So when, during the election, when I famously came out and said that I'm going to change my endorsement to Hillary Clinton for my personal safety, which I always appended to the end of that, I wasn't joking.
[02:25:49.342 --> 02:25:54.083]  I did that actually, literally for my personal safety, and I believe it helped.
[02:25:54.583 --> 02:26:02.250]  Because the moment I said that, people didn't care why I was changing sides, even though it was somewhat transparent that I was doing it for a specific reason.
[02:26:03.210 --> 02:26:05.552]  They just said, well, okay, now we got another one on our side.
[02:26:05.893 --> 02:26:07.234]  Let's go scare somebody else.
[02:26:07.874 --> 02:26:23.307]  So when you see gigantic, oversized reactions like we're seeing, people marching in the streets because they think, you know, a Hitler monster has been elected, even though we're not seeing the evidence of that, and it's been many months, seems like we would have, and even if
[02:26:23.945 --> 02:26:26.786]  People don't really become Hitler at age 70.
[02:26:27.327 --> 02:26:29.307]  You know, that's something we don't really see.
[02:26:29.328 --> 02:26:40.653]  So if they're screaming at the sky, they're bringing guns to places to shoot Republicans because they're that worked up, that's probably cognitive dissonance.
[02:26:41.433 --> 02:26:49.777]  And I even saw some studies showing brain scans of hardcore Democrats that they'd gone through PTSD and the brain actually showed signs of real trauma.
[02:26:51.024 --> 02:26:51.885]  Yeah, this is real.
[02:26:53.085 --> 02:26:58.709]  You know, if your mind goes to that dark place and stays there long enough, you've got a problem.
[02:26:59.109 --> 02:27:12.198]  Now, keep in mind, I had called this out, and I write about this in Winn-Bigley, that the Clinton persuasion game was terrible right until Bernie dropped out, and then it went to weapons grade.
[02:27:12.558 --> 02:27:18.482]  Do you remember as soon as the Republican convention was over, the moment it was over and they switched to the pundits?
[02:27:19.063 --> 02:27:20.744]  Every pundit used the same word.
[02:27:21.244 --> 02:27:21.845]  It's dark.
[02:27:22.025 --> 02:27:23.126]  It was a dark speech.
[02:27:23.146 --> 02:27:24.387]  Just dark, dark, dark.
[02:27:24.867 --> 02:27:28.149]  That was the moment I called that there must be a professional.
[02:27:28.750 --> 02:27:36.275]  Maybe somebody who was helping Bernie until he dropped out because it was the timing of Clinton's improvement in this area was sort of suspicious.
[02:27:37.176 --> 02:27:42.940]  So as soon as she started saying that everything he was doing was dark and dark and dark, it activated fear.
[02:27:43.641 --> 02:27:46.543]  So she went to fear persuasion, which is the strongest.
[02:27:47.159 --> 02:27:52.241]  She had started with, I have experience, things are going okay, let's do more of the same.
[02:27:53.081 --> 02:27:55.122]  Let's not have these Republican ideas.
[02:27:55.522 --> 02:27:59.403]  Somewhat of a policy-based, experience-based persuasion.
[02:27:59.503 --> 02:28:00.784]  And it wasn't very effective.
[02:28:01.354 --> 02:28:09.360]  But by the summer, she had picked up, you know, the dark theme, and that was just a magnet for every bad idea that everybody had.
[02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:18.307]  But separately, Trump was optimistic for a new, better future, but pointing out that they were the ones that were negative, and they were the ones putting out the negative message.
[02:28:18.327 --> 02:28:21.970]  So it was true, now he's gotten in, now he's partially delivered.
[02:28:22.730 --> 02:28:27.234]  Like you said earlier, how are they going to say it's all a nightmare when we see the economy coming back?
[02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:35.576]  Yeah, I had predicted, uh, prior to Inauguration Day, that you would see the following, uh, story arc play out in the real world.
[02:28:36.156 --> 02:28:41.140]  That they would start by saying, my God, we've elected Hiller, and it would just be non-stop Hiller, Hiller, Hiller.
[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:45.824]  Until several months had passed, I predicted, and he hadn't done any Hiller stuff.
[02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:49.942]  Because, you know, after a while, you just can't maintain the image.
[02:28:50.342 --> 02:28:51.303]  Scott, stay there!
[02:28:51.603 --> 02:28:52.023]  We gotta go to break.
[02:28:52.043 --> 02:28:54.744]  I'm gonna come back and talk about your new book, Wynne Bigley.
[02:28:54.785 --> 02:28:55.605]  I can't wait to read it.
[02:28:55.985 --> 02:28:56.425]  Stay with us.

[02:31:16.499 --> 02:31:18.860]  That's a very important part of our human chemistry.
[02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:25.661]  So you already know that we live in an environment that is just loaded with toxic chemicals.

[02:33:08.481 --> 02:33:17.028]  I see the red moon rising
[02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:29.571]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:29.591 --> 02:33:31.952]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.032 --> 02:33:37.333]  Stephen Bannon calls it a war for the Republic, and then they act like he invented that.
[02:33:37.433 --> 02:33:38.573]  No, politics is war.
[02:33:39.953 --> 02:33:48.255]  And as the creator of Dilbert, Scott Adams, was just saying, who's a technologist, engineer, before he ever created Dilbert, and then all his other best-selling books,
[02:33:51.072 --> 02:33:54.373]  But for me, I don't promote fear-based stuff to manipulate people.
[02:33:54.413 --> 02:33:55.913]  They are coming after our guns.
[02:33:56.253 --> 02:33:57.694]  They are selling out our industry.
[02:33:57.934 --> 02:33:59.334]  They are doing one-sided deals.
[02:33:59.414 --> 02:34:08.036]  As long as you're scaring people with the truth to get them to take action, like if your house is on fire to get out, then I see it as a good thing.
[02:34:08.656 --> 02:34:10.697]  So for me, I've never studied persuasion.
[02:34:10.817 --> 02:34:14.638]  I just go with my gut and with what's common sense.
[02:34:15.938 --> 02:34:19.839]  And now that Trump's delivered so much on what he said he would do so early,
[02:34:22.372 --> 02:34:37.977]  Compared to the politics of lying, where you lie to people, you manipulate them, and then you don't deliver to them on purpose, because you're such a sociopath, you think it's chump-like to actually care about people.
[02:34:39.258 --> 02:34:47.703]  Whereas a real ruling class would want prosperity that produces more technology, more medicine, more science, so they could skim off the top and be even more rich.
[02:34:47.783 --> 02:34:54.888]  But see, there's a chicken you-know-what factor, a chicken SH, you know what I call the chicken bleep dimension.
[02:34:56.967 --> 02:35:08.634]  That we see in cultures that become decadent, where the grandkids of the people that actually made the money, made the inventions, just become these jerks that hate flyover country and want to dominate and control everybody.
[02:35:09.294 --> 02:35:10.095]  And that's what I see.
[02:35:10.155 --> 02:35:12.756]  But I'm telling you, I'm going to read Winn Begley.
[02:35:12.796 --> 02:35:15.578]  I'm going to try to carry it at the Infowars bookstore online.
[02:35:16.398 --> 02:35:21.241]  Because I've already read two of his other books, Persuasion and A World Where Facts Don't Matter.
[02:35:22.210 --> 02:35:24.072]  And then it goes into the summer of 2015.
[02:35:24.112 --> 02:35:26.594]  Scott Adams was in the middle of a planned career pivot.
[02:35:27.114 --> 02:35:31.118]  A guy who created the Dilbert comic to a maverick political pundit.
[02:35:31.138 --> 02:35:33.400]  And I like the fact that they persecuted him.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:34.781]  He didn't back off.
[02:35:34.801 --> 02:35:36.162]  He got deeper into it.
[02:35:36.623 --> 02:35:39.065]  And has now created a whole other career for himself.
[02:35:39.425 --> 02:35:42.128]  Winn Bigley persuasion in a world where facts don't matter.
[02:35:43.134 --> 02:35:46.077]  And there's other books he's written as well.
[02:35:46.677 --> 02:35:53.263]  But he gets into the whole way of linguistic skills, linguistic kill shots, setting the table, visual persuasion.
[02:35:53.563 --> 02:35:54.384]  How about this?
[02:35:54.884 --> 02:35:58.748]  They want the TPP, a secret global group, to control and run my life.
[02:35:58.788 --> 02:35:59.508]  Trump's against it.
[02:35:59.769 --> 02:36:00.689]  That makes perfect sense.
[02:36:01.090 --> 02:36:04.213]  How about they want my guns and want to bankrupt the economy to control me?
[02:36:04.953 --> 02:36:07.679]  And make me be a renter and not an owner in my own life.
[02:36:07.959 --> 02:36:09.702]  How about that's authoritarian, I'm against it.
[02:36:09.763 --> 02:36:15.513]  I mean, at a certain point, isn't fear-mongering a good thing, Scott Adams, if it's true?
[02:36:17.001 --> 02:36:21.362]  Well, the ideal situation is the one that Trump used.
[02:36:21.562 --> 02:36:24.663]  I call him a master persuader because he's good at this stuff.
[02:36:25.323 --> 02:36:28.304]  And what he did is he would show you the optimistic view.
[02:36:28.484 --> 02:36:30.985]  You know, if you elect me, everything's going to be great.
[02:36:31.045 --> 02:36:33.165]  We'll have, you know, X percent GDP.
[02:36:33.265 --> 02:36:36.146]  We'll be in a golden age, making America great again.
[02:36:36.606 --> 02:36:39.427]  But at the moment, we're in this bad situation.
[02:36:39.927 --> 02:36:45.089]  So he'll describe the current situation as terrible, while contrasting it with the amazing times ahead.
[02:36:45.610 --> 02:36:49.791]  And if you think about it, as soon as I say that, you say to yourself, well isn't that just normal?
[02:36:49.951 --> 02:36:52.112]  People say it's bad, I'm gonna give you something better.
[02:36:52.553 --> 02:36:55.374]  But if you look at the Clinton campaign,
[02:36:56.649 --> 02:37:00.711]  You didn't see a lot of the world is going to be great under my administration.
[02:37:00.911 --> 02:37:04.993]  I didn't see the upside presented as part of the sale.
[02:37:05.033 --> 02:37:06.554]  That's because they want to break our will.
[02:37:06.614 --> 02:37:07.335]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:37:07.355 --> 02:37:08.535]  They want a permanent underclass.
[02:37:08.835 --> 02:37:11.577]  I mean, Obama said you can't have cars in air conditioning to Africans.
[02:37:13.635 --> 02:37:16.198]  Well, I don't know about their secret thoughts.
[02:37:16.298 --> 02:37:24.385]  One of the things that I always caution against is that we imagine we can tell what's in the minds and motivations of people, and we're terrible at that.
[02:37:24.646 --> 02:37:33.054]  Then maybe Hillary's just super, super stupid, because if she's not promoting prosperity, how's that going to create optimism to get the stock market up?
[02:37:34.158 --> 02:37:42.960]  Well, one of her biggest problems that I read about in the book is that she used to say in her tweets, if you remember this pattern, she would say, imagine President Trump.
[02:37:43.360 --> 02:37:49.961]  And then the next part, if you click through, which a lot of people didn't, would be something bad he might do if he were elected president.
[02:37:50.421 --> 02:37:53.722]  But the first part was a persuasion mistake of the first order.
[02:37:54.122 --> 02:37:59.743]  She was telling people to imagine the very thing that he was also trying to tell them to imagine.
[02:38:00.363 --> 02:38:01.063]  Exactly.
[02:38:01.264 --> 02:38:01.584]  Exactly.
[02:38:32.242 --> 02:38:36.948]  It shows why the Democratic establishment tried to get rid of Hillary, but she was able to hold on.
[02:38:37.349 --> 02:38:43.778]  Didn't she understand that by, again, making Trump front and center, she was actually creating her own political demise?
[02:38:45.795 --> 02:38:48.157]  Yeah, there was a lot of things she didn't understand.
[02:38:48.717 --> 02:39:02.308]  Let me tell you, you're reminding me of my best prediction in the book, which some say didn't quite happen, but I predicted early on that by the end, Trump would be effectively running unopposed.
[02:39:02.948 --> 02:39:11.253]  And I thought that I detected a variation in the way she looked from day to day that often suggests an underlying health problem.
[02:39:11.734 --> 02:39:17.897]  Now, I'm not a doctor, but hypnotists learn to look at microchanges and facial and other movements.
[02:39:18.178 --> 02:39:22.160]  Some days she looked like she'd been run over by a truck and drank four bottles of vodka.
[02:39:22.180 --> 02:39:23.581]  Other days she just looked okay.
[02:39:23.861 --> 02:39:24.942]  The woman looks like hell.
[02:39:26.055 --> 02:39:30.018]  Yeah, and compare that to Trump, who kind of looks exactly the same every day.
[02:39:30.118 --> 02:39:34.642]  His energy level's pretty much the same, and that's a sign of good health.
[02:39:35.162 --> 02:39:44.529]  Now, we know from Donna Brazile's book now that there was a point where at least she was concerned that her health was so bad that maybe they should consider taking her out.
[02:39:44.769 --> 02:39:50.514]  So that's about as close as you could get to running unopposed, although not literally or technically true.
[02:39:52.014 --> 02:39:53.254]  So it's all being vindicated.
[02:39:53.314 --> 02:39:55.715]  They were thinking about removing her and putting Biden in.
[02:39:56.115 --> 02:39:58.596]  She was basically fixing the nomination process.
[02:39:59.836 --> 02:40:00.976]  Is it too little, too late?
[02:40:01.037 --> 02:40:05.978]  Can the Democrats reverse their political seppuku that they've committed?
[02:40:07.458 --> 02:40:20.622]  Well, before you go on for that, I just have to point out something I haven't heard anybody say, but when Donna Brazile was saying we're going to replace maybe Hillary and Tim Kaine with possibly Biden and I think Cory Booker,
[02:40:21.428 --> 02:40:22.728]  What happened to Tim Kaine?
[02:40:24.229 --> 02:40:25.249]  What did he do wrong?
[02:40:25.469 --> 02:40:27.370]  Was he never the right choice to begin with?
[02:40:27.770 --> 02:40:30.371]  It was kind of an odd choice that he would be thrown under the bus.
[02:40:30.711 --> 02:40:36.493]  Now, of course, we imagine that the reason was because they wanted to, you know, play to their identity politics.
[02:40:36.893 --> 02:40:40.114]  And they just couldn't have two white guys running for office.
[02:40:40.635 --> 02:40:47.297]  So it was the most blatant confession of racism.
[02:40:48.234 --> 02:40:53.498]  That's a big point.
[02:40:54.459 --> 02:40:56.921]  And let's expand on that.
[02:40:57.202 --> 02:41:02.206]  She also admits, well, we couldn't get rid of Hillary because she was a woman and that would make women men.
[02:41:02.546 --> 02:41:04.828]  You should have whoever the best candidate is, woman or man.
[02:41:05.108 --> 02:41:09.572]  It shows how it's all identity politics, the opposite of what Martin Luther King talked about.
[02:41:10.953 --> 02:41:26.244]  Yeah, I think in the end, one of her biggest problems, you know, if you don't count the basket of deplorables, which, you know, I think we would all count as her biggest mistake, just the fact that she said, I'm going to make a thing about being a woman, you know, even one of her
[02:41:26.704 --> 02:41:27.725]  It's hypocritical!
[02:41:43.643 --> 02:41:49.430]  Well, you can't say men are better at certain things under their cosmology, but then she's saying they can say women are better.
[02:41:49.671 --> 02:41:57.581]  It's like the pigs in Animal Farm saying, you know, four legs good, two legs bad, unless we're pigs and we walk on two legs, then it's okay.
[02:41:58.604 --> 02:41:58.784]  Right.
[02:41:59.044 --> 02:42:04.248]  Now, compare that to who I would call another master persuader, President Obama.
[02:42:05.048 --> 02:42:08.790]  Even if you don't like his politics, he was very good at this.
[02:42:09.511 --> 02:42:14.914]  And he ran for president as the first African-American who had a really good chance of winning.
[02:42:15.514 --> 02:42:17.316]  And he never made that a theme.
[02:42:17.796 --> 02:42:20.618]  He never said, elect me because I'm an African-American.
[02:42:20.978 --> 02:42:23.720]  He never said, elect me because I'll be your first African-American.
[02:42:23.940 --> 02:42:27.442]  He may have even mentioned it a few times in passing, but it wasn't a theme.
[02:42:28.042 --> 02:42:35.844]  And I think that allowed people to say, okay, as long as you're not making that the theme, we'll look at the politics and we'll look at the policy.
[02:42:35.864 --> 02:42:41.165]  They were very smart knowing a lot of conservatives would go for it for real equality because he wasn't making it racial.
[02:42:42.306 --> 02:42:42.486]  Right.
[02:42:42.666 --> 02:42:44.886]  Yeah, that felt like a step forward for everybody.
[02:42:45.386 --> 02:42:47.947]  Wow, Scott Adams, I can't wait to hear what you say next.
[02:42:47.967 --> 02:42:51.528]  The creator of Dilbert, the new book, Winn-Bigley, out now.
[02:42:51.928 --> 02:42:52.628]  Can't wait to read it.
[02:42:52.728 --> 02:42:54.809]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com.
[02:43:02.639 --> 02:43:06.962]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[02:43:07.423 --> 02:43:12.467]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[02:43:13.007 --> 02:43:16.930]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[02:43:16.970 --> 02:43:20.273]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[02:43:20.933 --> 02:43:25.397]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[02:43:26.017 --> 02:43:29.280]  It's you the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[02:43:29.980 --> 02:43:31.522]  I came in here an hour ago.
[02:43:32.262 --> 02:43:39.487]  And I literally just went to Infowarsstore.com and printed the five-star reviews, the first few pages.
[02:43:39.788 --> 02:43:43.590]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[02:43:44.191 --> 02:43:47.593]  And it's five-star after five-star after five-star.
[02:43:47.954 --> 02:43:49.655]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[02:43:50.095 --> 02:43:56.440]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:56.480 --> 02:43:57.381]  Let's go over them right now.
[02:43:57.921 --> 02:43:59.422]  This is Verified Buyer Mark.
[02:43:59.622 --> 02:44:02.565]  Five-star review for Anthroplex for men and women.
[02:44:03.045 --> 02:44:04.086]  I take it as directed.
[02:44:04.106 --> 02:44:15.014]  As one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[02:44:15.555 --> 02:44:16.235]  Easy does it.
[02:44:16.315 --> 02:44:17.336]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[02:44:17.356 --> 02:44:18.317]  It's very, very serious.
[02:44:18.717 --> 02:44:19.137]  Not a game.
[02:44:19.157 --> 02:44:19.578]  Thank you, Mark.
[02:44:20.078 --> 02:44:21.359]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[02:44:21.499 --> 02:44:22.279]  Energy all day.
[02:44:22.299 --> 02:44:30.023]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[02:44:30.463 --> 02:44:31.164]  Another review.
[02:44:31.184 --> 02:44:32.184]  I love this one.
[02:44:32.484 --> 02:44:34.925]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[02:44:35.306 --> 02:44:38.827]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[02:44:39.107 --> 02:44:42.029]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[02:44:42.409 --> 02:44:43.950]  Here's another one, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:44.330 --> 02:44:47.691]  Five Star Review for Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[02:44:47.971 --> 02:44:51.152]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[02:44:51.212 --> 02:44:55.933]  I don't get sick last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[02:44:56.074 --> 02:44:57.054]  Amazing product.
[02:44:57.774 --> 02:44:59.875]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[02:45:00.295 --> 02:45:01.295]  Here's one from Brian.
[02:45:01.616 --> 02:45:03.696]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[02:45:03.816 --> 02:45:04.657]  Thank you all.
[02:45:05.057 --> 02:45:08.698]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[02:45:08.778 --> 02:45:10.979]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[02:45:11.379 --> 02:45:13.320]  Every night owl should have this product.
[02:45:13.820 --> 02:45:17.261]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[02:45:17.521 --> 02:45:18.162]  And I should add,
[02:45:18.962 --> 02:45:20.103]  That's a great name for this product.
[02:45:20.363 --> 02:45:22.184]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[02:45:22.204 --> 02:45:23.925]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[02:45:24.265 --> 02:45:25.586]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[02:45:25.666 --> 02:45:27.267]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[02:45:27.307 --> 02:45:28.188]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[02:45:28.208 --> 02:45:28.868]  I said I'd shut up!
[02:45:29.729 --> 02:45:30.549]  But back to the script.
[02:45:30.909 --> 02:45:32.790]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[02:45:32.810 --> 02:45:33.551]  I love that name too.
[02:45:33.991 --> 02:45:36.012]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[02:45:36.312 --> 02:45:40.515]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[02:45:40.555 --> 02:45:43.137]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[02:45:43.197 --> 02:45:44.617]  You make it literally possible.
[02:45:45.678 --> 02:45:50.485]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million colloidal silver out there.
[02:45:51.006 --> 02:45:53.830]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[02:45:54.131 --> 02:45:57.676]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[02:45:58.197 --> 02:46:00.761]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be though, kinda, so.
[02:46:01.401 --> 02:46:03.903]  I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[02:46:04.243 --> 02:46:06.345]  This was the first product I purchased from Inforestore.
[02:46:06.685 --> 02:46:12.549]  Whenever I feel the first traces of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[02:46:12.969 --> 02:46:18.713]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015 and it's worked for everyone.
[02:46:19.193 --> 02:46:25.597]  It has become an expected gift for our family and that's why we get you the best products because we want to repeat customers.
[02:46:25.858 --> 02:46:26.658]  It's all a win-win.
[02:46:26.838 --> 02:46:27.719]  That's an awesome review.
[02:46:27.779 --> 02:46:30.961]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family as well.
[02:46:31.001 --> 02:46:33.041]  Well, we've only got 20 seconds left, folks.
[02:46:33.081 --> 02:46:36.062]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Caveman reviews.
[02:46:36.082 --> 02:46:37.262]  They're all five-star.
[02:46:37.502 --> 02:46:42.863]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[02:46:43.503 --> 02:46:46.784]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[02:46:47.084 --> 02:46:48.884]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[02:46:49.184 --> 02:46:52.705]  Find it all, folks, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:46:52.725 --> 02:46:57.846]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[02:47:05.678 --> 02:47:09.779]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:15.341 --> 02:47:19.162]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:47:19.882 --> 02:47:24.223]  Matt Dubiel and I will be hosting some of the next hour, getting to your phone calls for those that have been holding.
[02:47:24.243 --> 02:47:28.624]  We're going to have our Chicago affiliate broadcaster and station manager joining us.
[02:47:28.964 --> 02:47:29.925]  Always love having him on.
[02:47:30.305 --> 02:47:30.825]  Just briefly,
[02:47:32.054 --> 02:47:34.055]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[02:47:34.095 --> 02:47:34.975]  He's about to retire.
[02:47:34.995 --> 02:47:42.058]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[02:47:42.078 --> 02:47:45.079]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[02:47:45.099 --> 02:47:46.100]  That's a bunch of bull.
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:47.700]  You need fluoride or you die.
[02:47:48.240 --> 02:47:50.741]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[02:47:50.761 --> 02:47:51.522]  He said, this is incredible.
[02:47:51.942 --> 02:47:53.943]  This is Grignard Reagents Heavy Metals.
[02:47:53.983 --> 02:47:59.865]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[02:48:01.832 --> 02:48:02.293]  Exactly.
[02:48:02.353 --> 02:48:08.361]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[02:48:08.401 --> 02:48:12.146]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said reduce it in water by half.
[02:48:13.561 --> 02:48:20.024]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a hopped-up version of fluoride.
[02:48:20.485 --> 02:48:21.525]  It's been turned into an acid.
[02:48:21.986 --> 02:48:22.786]  And it's an adjuvant.
[02:48:22.826 --> 02:48:23.506]  It's very toxic.
[02:48:23.847 --> 02:48:35.393]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Tom's of Maine, it's private-labeled, Super Blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine, which you die without iodine.
[02:48:35.413 --> 02:48:36.974]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[02:48:37.334 --> 02:48:38.774]  If you drink the stuff that's in the store, it'll kill you.
[02:48:38.795 --> 02:48:39.735]  That's a different type of iodine.
[02:48:39.755 --> 02:48:41.156]  This is the real medical grade.
[02:48:41.796 --> 02:48:45.199]  Super blue toothpaste available at Infowarestore.com.
[02:48:45.859 --> 02:48:55.447]  But there is the CNN headline that fluoride in the water and in toothpaste is causing IQs to drop precipitously.
[02:48:55.788 --> 02:48:56.909]  And for seven years the
[02:48:57.967 --> 02:49:01.449]  American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age six with it.
[02:49:01.890 --> 02:49:04.551]  Why does it say nursery water than at the store with added fluoride?
[02:49:04.852 --> 02:49:07.313]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[02:49:07.353 --> 02:49:09.755]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:49:09.855 --> 02:49:18.120]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavored for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[02:49:18.441 --> 02:49:23.564]  Your purchases make everything we hear do possible, including DNA Force, now back in stock.
[02:49:24.064 --> 02:49:27.607]  Now, going to Scott Adams of blog.dilbert.com,
[02:49:28.308 --> 02:49:34.758]  And of course also on Twitter at Scott Adams says, how about the book Winn Bigley?
[02:49:35.419 --> 02:49:36.661]  What about the censorship?
[02:49:36.681 --> 02:49:39.325]  Because they've gone through cognitive dissonance, they've gone through traumatic...
[02:49:40.587 --> 02:49:41.508]  Uh, panic attacks.
[02:49:41.928 --> 02:49:43.509]  They believe Hitler has taken over.
[02:49:43.529 --> 02:49:47.272]  They ignore that the economy is getting better and that unity is increasing in polls.
[02:49:47.953 --> 02:49:54.758]  What do you expect to happen next, uh, as the establishment Democratic Party seems to just get more mentally ill?
[02:49:54.778 --> 02:49:58.881]  We know Donna Brazile's kind of trying to right the ship, but they don't appear to be listening to her.
[02:50:00.740 --> 02:50:06.123]  Well, I think as long as they're not successful, they're going to have to find a new approach.
[02:50:06.484 --> 02:50:10.406]  So I think just coming hard at Trump supporters.
[02:50:11.178 --> 02:50:17.441]  Uh, is not a path that's going to be productive for them, so they're going to be flailing around looking for something that works.
[02:50:18.042 --> 02:50:31.648]  Now, the problem is that if they're dealing with a successful presidency, and it's starting to look like that's a little harder to deny, as the economy does well, ISIS is defeated, immigration is down, you know, we're out of trade agreements.
[02:50:32.709 --> 02:50:36.591]  I would say if you're going to look to the future about what's the biggest
[02:50:37.151 --> 02:50:37.592]  Thank you.
[02:50:50.077 --> 02:50:52.519]  Predict that we're going to have some great success there.
[02:50:52.999 --> 02:50:57.882]  But I also don't think there's going to be any kind of a nuclear war coming out of that because nobody wants it.
[02:50:58.162 --> 02:51:01.404]  It's the one thing that nobody wants, including the North.
[02:51:02.645 --> 02:51:13.432]  But for the first time, I think you're seeing a situation where the North Korean leader, Little Rocket Man, probably wonders every day if he only has a month left to live.
[02:51:14.207 --> 02:51:18.329]  And I don't think that the leaders of North Korea have ever had that feeling before.
[02:51:18.950 --> 02:51:32.857]  So the president has given them this sense of genuine uncertainty about their future that I would think would make them a little bit more flexible if there's some way that they can get what they need at the same time we can get what we need, which will be the real trick.
[02:51:33.637 --> 02:51:34.158]  Scott Adams.
[02:51:35.396 --> 02:51:39.620]  Clearly North Korea had gotten more belligerent, more delusional, so we had to put some pressure on them.
[02:51:40.341 --> 02:51:42.462]  Most defense analysts agree with what the President's done.
[02:51:42.482 --> 02:51:44.004]  Japan certainly agrees.
[02:51:44.244 --> 02:51:46.286]  China's having to now put more pressure on North Korea.
[02:51:46.846 --> 02:51:51.491]  But you pull back at Saudi Arabia, the princes that were
[02:51:52.231 --> 02:51:55.633]  Going against the U.S., going against Trump, involve funding ISIS.
[02:51:56.034 --> 02:51:58.815]  They all just died in helicopter crashes or got killed at their houses.
[02:51:59.136 --> 02:52:00.877]  I'm not endorsed or arrested.
[02:52:01.137 --> 02:52:03.658]  I'm not endorsing any of this, but it is an authoritarian regime.
[02:52:03.939 --> 02:52:08.381]  But it does seem almost magic how all the enemies suddenly of the U.S.
[02:52:08.441 --> 02:52:16.807]  and of Trump and of anti-globalism, every election's going against the globalists, every election's going against socialists, everywhere the trend is.
[02:52:17.307 --> 02:52:20.130]  The New World Order is in deep, deep, deep, deep manure.
[02:52:20.651 --> 02:52:24.075]  And Trump just keeps coming up aces every time.
[02:52:24.456 --> 02:52:25.757]  I'm kind of pinching myself.
[02:52:25.797 --> 02:52:29.862]  I mean, I didn't expect Trump to deliver this good just 10 months in.
[02:52:29.902 --> 02:52:30.803]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:52:30.983 --> 02:52:32.605]  And then I learned from his family and others.
[02:52:33.832 --> 02:52:35.674]  His dad was a super anti-communist.
[02:52:36.054 --> 02:52:36.574]  So was he.
[02:52:36.614 --> 02:52:38.276]  They were donating to the John Birch Society.
[02:52:38.516 --> 02:52:39.577]  By the way, nobody even knew this.
[02:52:39.597 --> 02:52:42.439]  They had their whole Democrat face being nice in New York.
[02:52:42.759 --> 02:52:53.108]  And now we have a super libertarian Americana sleeper cell with a guy with incredible energy who's obviously a genius, now is the president of the United States.
[02:52:53.308 --> 02:52:58.312]  And just the communist Chinese, the Islamicists, they're all crapping their pants right now.
[02:53:00.031 --> 02:53:01.952]  Yeah, you know, you mentioned Saudi Arabia.
[02:53:02.272 --> 02:53:12.075]  If it's true, the reporting that the new leader over there actually wants to move them toward moderation, that's the biggest story in the world.
[02:53:12.555 --> 02:53:13.716]  That's the biggest story.
[02:53:15.251 --> 02:53:16.092]  In 10 years?
[02:53:16.112 --> 02:53:16.712]  20 years?
[02:53:16.732 --> 02:53:17.212]  Exactly.
[02:53:17.272 --> 02:53:18.693]  What is a bigger story than that?
[02:53:19.053 --> 02:53:23.075]  Now, we don't know if he'll succeed, but it is Saudi Arabia, right?
[02:53:23.355 --> 02:53:33.761]  I mean, they're guarding the holy sites, and one would think that whatever they do would have a ripple effect and could be the beginning of an extraordinary change.
[02:53:34.902 --> 02:53:42.686]  We don't know if President Trump had anything directly to do with that, but we do know he's getting along well with them over there, and that can't hurt.
[02:53:44.538 --> 02:53:49.299]  I mean, I don't want to be too messianic here, because obviously Trump's just a person bringing back classic Americana.
[02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:51.600]  That's why everybody wanted to move here to begin with.
[02:53:51.700 --> 02:53:52.720]  It's not like he invented this.
[02:53:52.740 --> 02:53:54.121]  We're just coming back to this.
[02:53:54.141 --> 02:53:55.021]  People are hungry for it.
[02:53:55.041 --> 02:54:09.365]  I mean, how would you describe this whole Trump phenomenon, nationalist phenomenon from Austria to Italy to the Czech Republic to Poland to Iceland to Australia to Brexit to the U.S.?
[02:54:09.525 --> 02:54:11.506]  I mean, what happened?
[02:54:13.382 --> 02:54:25.470]  Yeah, I'm not enough of a student of world affairs to know if there's some common theme that runs across all these countries, because sometimes it's easy to imagine a pattern where there isn't one.
[02:54:26.330 --> 02:54:34.976]  In the United States, one of the things that President Trump and before that candidate Trump did so well is he gave people different reasons to like him.
[02:54:35.612 --> 02:54:43.016]  So if you liked populism or you liked his immigration policies, you'd say, that's what I like.
[02:54:43.076 --> 02:54:45.657]  If you liked maybe lower taxes, you like that.
[02:54:46.137 --> 02:54:51.700]  But my favorite is he does something I would call strategic ambiguity.
[02:54:52.260 --> 02:54:52.741]  We're good to go.
[02:55:08.010 --> 02:55:21.579]  But if you didn't think religion was terribly important and you didn't really want it to be a big feature of the government, you would also say to yourself, yes, he says these things because that's good politics and we don't know what's in his heart, but he doesn't seem to be a big church guy.
[02:55:22.019 --> 02:55:22.900]  I'm comfortable with that.
[02:55:23.479 --> 02:55:31.123]  So, it's amazing how many times he'll present two completely different visions, and people can be comfortable in the one that works for them.
[02:55:31.143 --> 02:55:31.383]  Exactly.
[02:55:31.403 --> 02:55:33.705]  He's very, very pragmatic, but let me give you some of the secret sauce.
[02:55:33.745 --> 02:55:36.866]  I know you're a smart guy, and you've been a technologist before you became a best-selling author.
[02:55:38.527 --> 02:55:40.288]  Globalism is anti-free market.
[02:55:40.348 --> 02:55:41.489]  It's anti-home rule.
[02:55:41.509 --> 02:55:42.569]  It's anti-nationalism.
[02:55:42.889 --> 02:55:47.231]  From TPP to securing our borders, he's bringing back national identity.
[02:55:47.652 --> 02:56:02.619]  And all over the world, it is an anti-globalist, anti-radical Islamic system of not wanting to be colonized by the modern liberal ethos of world government powered by socialism, communism, authoritarian Islam.
[02:56:02.919 --> 02:56:05.901]  And it's the fact that he did that that has put
[02:56:06.541 --> 02:56:14.525]  He energized other nationalist movements and made it sexy now, creating a new wave behind Trump that is anti-New World Order.
[02:56:14.805 --> 02:56:19.487]  My listeners, I will tell you, you kept, Nigel Farage will say, half their supporters came from Infowars.
[02:56:19.827 --> 02:56:23.989]  We allowed the critical mass, our listeners, to push this over the edge globally.
[02:56:24.209 --> 02:56:26.850]  So I just want people to know, the secret sauce is our audience.
[02:56:28.842 --> 02:56:29.742]  Well, that may be.
[02:56:29.762 --> 02:56:36.865]  I mean, you've got a tremendous reach, and certainly the things you're saying are compatible with the things who are voting on the winning team.
[02:56:38.005 --> 02:56:43.907]  It's hard to figure out whose persuasion, whose factor is really the key variable in these
[02:56:44.407 --> 02:56:47.610]  Multivariable situations, but I totally agree.
[02:56:47.670 --> 02:56:57.518]  It's a giant spectrum I just want our listeners to know being involved being active busting their butts to stand up for Americana all these years and getting bullied Baby, it's we're hitting pay dirt.
[02:56:57.538 --> 02:57:08.247]  We're starting to turn the tide You know, I think you just used a word that is very active and this the bully word that the feeling that the people who?
[02:57:09.148 --> 02:57:11.550]  who other other people thought were in charge and
[02:57:12.897 --> 02:57:16.679]  The people who others thought were in charge were actually feeling bullied.
[02:57:17.099 --> 02:57:29.266]  So a lot of Trump supporters, and I would put myself in that camp in terms of the bullying, we actually felt like this was no longer a discussion about what's the best way to run things.
[02:57:29.787 --> 02:57:31.808]  It just felt like bullying after a while.
[02:57:31.928 --> 02:57:34.329]  And you didn't take it lying down.
[02:57:34.389 --> 02:57:35.430]  Scott Adams, the new book.
[02:57:35.790 --> 02:57:37.071]  Winn Begley, awesome.
[02:57:37.111 --> 02:57:37.751]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:57:37.791 --> 02:57:38.472]  Come back again soon.
[02:57:39.511 --> 02:57:40.753]  Oh, thank you so much for having me.
[02:57:40.913 --> 02:57:41.595]  That was amazing.
[02:57:41.635 --> 02:57:41.815]  Wow.
[02:57:41.855 --> 02:57:42.476]  Can we read the book?
[02:57:42.496 --> 02:57:45.641]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break with The Fourth Hour.
[02:57:45.922 --> 02:57:47.805]  Your phone calls, Matt Dubio and more.
[02:57:48.125 --> 02:57:48.787]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:57:52.835 --> 02:57:54.276]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[02:58:43.495 --> 02:58:44.516]  That means it's pure.

[02:58:55.963 --> 02:59:00.286]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:59:01.427 --> 02:59:02.148]  Optimum levels.
[02:59:03.223 --> 02:59:07.826]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[02:59:07.846 --> 02:59:09.807]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:59:10.187 --> 02:59:11.968]  B vitamins we need every day.
[02:59:11.988 --> 02:59:17.071]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[02:59:17.251 --> 02:59:18.932]  O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[02:59:19.592 --> 02:59:24.695]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[02:59:25.235 --> 02:59:25.555]  Secret 12.
[02:59:26.736 --> 02:59:27.617]  I think so.
[02:59:56.403 --> 03:00:00.747]  Receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:00.827 --> 03:00:21.304]  From the front lines... From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:25.091 --> 03:00:31.195]  If you just joined us in the last hour, we had an intriguing guest on, Scott Adams.
[03:00:32.636 --> 03:00:41.981]  He is a former technologist working for some of the top companies in the world, then became a top cartoonist and now best-selling author and political pundit.
[03:00:43.082 --> 03:00:44.122]  And at the end of the interview,
[03:00:45.270 --> 03:01:00.363]  That's extremely informative and powerful about the nature of the election, where we're going, populist movements, the collective insanity of the left, where they began buying into their own propaganda that they were putting out during the campaign and fell into a deeper mental illness.
[03:01:01.724 --> 03:01:09.952]  During that intriguing interview, towards the end, he was saying that out of all the different complexities and different systems
[03:01:11.364 --> 03:01:19.410]  of persuasion, he couldn't put his finger on the dominant thread that got President Trump elected.
[03:01:21.031 --> 03:01:22.091]  And I told him that thread.
[03:01:22.812 --> 03:01:40.824]  I said, it's the audience of this radio show and the Drudge Report, basically, that understood that the globalists were conquering this country, that understood they wanted austerity, that understood that they wanted to bring in a permanent underclass system and defeat the American Renaissance system forever.
[03:01:42.099 --> 03:01:43.581]  And so up society.
[03:01:44.001 --> 03:01:45.123]  So up technology.
[03:01:46.104 --> 03:01:48.607]  Get rid of the ladders up into middle class and wealth.
[03:01:49.528 --> 03:01:52.072]  And that the people said no to that fundamentally.
[03:01:52.392 --> 03:01:58.380]  And that it was our InfoWars audience that got Trump over the edge and won him the nomination.
[03:02:00.410 --> 03:02:16.583]  And that fought in real time to counter globalist disinformation and to tell the truth about election fraud and Bernie Sanders having the election stolen and Bill Clinton's illegitimate child and Bill Clinton's rape and Hillary's Uranium One and to get threatened and to be attacked.
[03:02:17.847 --> 03:02:19.328]  And that's why Hillary came after us.
[03:02:20.109 --> 03:02:21.970]  And that's why Obama came after us.
[03:02:22.030 --> 03:02:25.752]  Because they knew what was hurting them and what was affecting them.
[03:02:25.992 --> 03:02:30.876]  And I don't tell that story to make us sound big or to make you feel big.
[03:02:31.236 --> 03:02:40.002]  It's because the globalists already know it and are already targeting us and going after us to destroy us politically because they know we've got their number.
[03:02:41.445 --> 03:02:44.347]  Understanding the past is the key to the future.
[03:02:44.867 --> 03:02:46.569]  Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[03:02:47.269 --> 03:03:02.780]  And we have gotten a major beachhead, not just here, but globally, to the unelected private corporate world government running these politicians and systems, and as I've said 10,000 times probably, once you identify globalism as an authoritarian, unelected
[03:03:04.500 --> 03:03:11.403]  Anti-human, anti-prosperity system, there's no way for them ever to get their program finished.
[03:03:12.023 --> 03:03:13.644]  Now does that mean we've got some utopia?
[03:03:14.024 --> 03:03:15.765]  Does that mean we defeat them, everything's okay?
[03:03:15.805 --> 03:03:16.045]  No.
[03:03:17.505 --> 03:03:24.928]  But at least we've got a shot, because we don't have people in there fundamentally working against prosperity because it creates too much competition.
[03:03:25.749 --> 03:03:28.710]  We're promoting the American system of renaissance.
[03:03:30.149 --> 03:03:33.891]  And the world hears it, and the world knows it, and the enemy knows it.
[03:03:34.212 --> 03:03:48.121]  So it's time for all of our affiliates, and all of our sponsors, and all of our listeners, and this incredible crew to understand you are part of one of the most important battles politically in the history of humanity.
[03:03:48.921 --> 03:03:53.284]  And you are helping to change the world fundamentally.
[03:03:54.215 --> 03:04:12.524]  And you put up with the bullying, you put up with all the garbage, you put up with the peer pressure, you put up with being called a racist, you put up with all the rest of the crud, or a Russian agent, and you went through the challenge, you went through the attacks, you stayed the course, and you were trailblazers, and you changed the world.
[03:04:13.245 --> 03:04:19.088]  And women, and so-called minorities, who stood up with Trump and with Infowars,
[03:04:20.652 --> 03:04:21.792]  You changed the world.
[03:04:21.892 --> 03:04:23.293]  You went through the peer pressure.
[03:04:23.653 --> 03:04:27.093]  You did stuff that's even harder than for somebody like myself to do.
[03:04:28.254 --> 03:04:37.356]  And so, when I salute you and thank you, it's because what you've done, and what we've done, should be studied as the model of future victory.
[03:04:37.636 --> 03:04:38.536]  And is being studied.
[03:04:39.576 --> 03:04:40.216]  All over the world.
[03:04:41.576 --> 03:04:44.257]  And you see the success dominoing now.
[03:04:45.885 --> 03:04:46.686]  We're on the march.
[03:04:46.726 --> 03:04:48.268]  The empire's on the run.
[03:04:49.129 --> 03:04:51.131]  And I want to salute all of you for what you've done.
[03:04:51.151 --> 03:04:57.980]  But everybody needs to tune into that interview with the creator of Dilbert, Scott Adams, and his new book, Winn Bigley.
[03:04:58.400 --> 03:04:59.061]  We'll be back.
[03:04:59.101 --> 03:04:59.561]  Stay with us.
[03:05:06.783 --> 03:05:12.986]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:05:14.026 --> 03:05:21.609]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[03:05:22.790 --> 03:05:27.812]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[03:05:30.393 --> 03:05:35.497]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[03:05:36.017 --> 03:05:36.378]  Secret 12.
[03:05:37.859 --> 03:05:38.739]  Optimal absorption.
[03:05:39.019 --> 03:05:43.723]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[03:05:44.163 --> 03:05:48.366]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[03:05:49.347 --> 03:05:50.088]  Optimum levels.
[03:05:51.509 --> 03:05:55.334]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.
[03:05:55.655 --> 03:06:00.020]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and support optimal brain and body function with Secret 12.
[03:06:00.841 --> 03:06:02.083]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[03:06:14.517 --> 03:06:21.882]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:22.003 --> 03:06:24.044]  AM 1530, WCKG, Matt Dibbio.
[03:06:24.344 --> 03:06:26.526]  Hosted the fourth hour at least once a week and I love it.
[03:06:26.726 --> 03:06:28.467]  We're adding more broadcasts, more shows here.
[03:06:29.568 --> 03:06:32.150]  Trying to work it out to get him to co-host a show five days a week.
[03:06:32.951 --> 03:06:36.833]  I promised I'd go to Tim, Brian, Sue, Faith, Tal, and others.
[03:06:36.853 --> 03:06:39.836]  Then I'm gonna get out here and let him host a show he's been preparing for all day.
[03:06:41.032 --> 03:06:48.576]  But I promised to go to your calls, but you were left over from before, I guess we leave the best for last, when we had Scott Adams on.
[03:06:48.596 --> 03:06:57.500]  So we're going to go to your calls and let you have your take on the tragic events in Texas before I get out of here and then eat my lunch while I actually watch and listen to Matt Dubio.
[03:06:57.520 --> 03:06:59.621]  But Matt, tell folks what you've got coming up today.
[03:07:02.757 --> 03:07:04.798]  A little bit about Texas, a little bit about Chicago.
[03:07:05.138 --> 03:07:10.659]  There's been some shootings in Chicago that people forget about, and I'd just like to remind people of that.
[03:07:11.819 --> 03:07:20.381]  Donna Brazile's book is a hot topic, and why I think she's a massive, very, very good persuader, and I know that Scott was talking about persuasion.
[03:07:20.441 --> 03:07:23.662]  He's the expert, but I saw her doing some things, so we'll get into that.
[03:07:25.823 --> 03:07:27.503]  I tell you, why do you think she's doing this?
[03:07:27.523 --> 03:07:30.124]  I think to cover her own butt, she's knee-deep in all the corruption.
[03:07:31.209 --> 03:07:33.950]  Well, for starters, she wants to sell books.
[03:07:34.491 --> 03:07:35.051]  We know that.
[03:07:35.371 --> 03:07:39.733]  And her publisher wants her to sell books, and that's what she's got to do to begin with.
[03:07:40.333 --> 03:07:47.517]  Secondly, I think that her dedicating her stuff to Seth Rich is kind of a big deal, because it's a persuasion technique.
[03:07:47.577 --> 03:07:50.078]  It gets the rest of us to go, oh, she's not so bad.
[03:07:53.380 --> 03:07:56.221]  It signifies that she knows they're loathed and hated.
[03:07:56.661 --> 03:07:58.002]  She's trying to join our side.
[03:07:59.130 --> 03:08:06.876]  Yeah, well, and I think Scott would say it's a persuasion tactic to get people to kind of rally behind her and say she's not so bad.
[03:08:06.916 --> 03:08:08.637]  I wouldn't be surprised if she ran for office.
[03:08:09.057 --> 03:08:10.478]  It doesn't have to be national office.
[03:08:10.498 --> 03:08:14.922]  It could be a Senate seat or Congress someplace, but I'm sure she's going to be doing that.
[03:08:15.882 --> 03:08:21.844]  So this is her attempt at a facelift and shows that the Clintons really have wrecked the Democratic Party brand.
[03:08:22.364 --> 03:08:23.424]  I mean, how would you describe it?
[03:08:23.464 --> 03:08:25.225]  They are now a coastal elite party.
[03:08:25.725 --> 03:08:27.285]  They're loathed by their own constituents.
[03:08:28.026 --> 03:08:33.127]  The demonization of Trump is wearing off as the proof in the pudding that his presidency's not failed.
[03:08:33.447 --> 03:08:35.528]  In fact, it's maverick and beautiful so far.
[03:08:36.608 --> 03:08:39.109]  How would you describe, then, the state of the party, the Democratic Party?
[03:08:39.389 --> 03:08:39.969]  Delusional?
[03:08:40.009 --> 03:08:40.549]  Psychotic?
[03:08:41.009 --> 03:08:42.690]  Burning itself down out of control?
[03:08:43.703 --> 03:08:48.005]  Well, you know, my grandfather was a first-generation American-born Chicago Democrat.
[03:08:48.045 --> 03:08:50.806]  His father was an alderman in Chicago.
[03:08:51.287 --> 03:08:58.910]  And back then, the Democrats would get out on the streets and they were, you know, they would talk about trying to get President Kennedy elected, and they had pride in America.
[03:08:59.211 --> 03:09:04.893]  They were connected to America, this Democratic Party, and the Republicans, too, if they're not careful.
[03:09:05.674 --> 03:09:12.237]  Although things have, the tide has changed, but this Democratic Party, for sure, is completely disconnected from the core of America.
[03:09:12.517 --> 03:09:14.759]  Basically, why are they so anti-American?
[03:09:14.819 --> 03:09:16.260]  They literally hate the country.
[03:09:17.580 --> 03:09:21.323]  I don't... It seems like suicide to me.
[03:09:22.324 --> 03:09:23.584]  I don't know what the hell is going on.
[03:09:23.604 --> 03:09:28.608]  Exactly, because I was hearing the Dilbert creator talking about persuasion and fearmongering.
[03:09:28.648 --> 03:09:29.629]  They do want our guns.
[03:09:29.669 --> 03:09:30.429]  They do hate us.
[03:09:30.469 --> 03:09:32.951]  I mean, they do the scaremongering for us.
[03:09:32.991 --> 03:09:35.493]  They really are worse than we can say.
[03:09:35.893 --> 03:09:37.454]  I mean, they're just crazy people.
[03:09:38.618 --> 03:09:40.099]  They're completely disconnected.
[03:09:40.139 --> 03:09:46.323]  I tweeted yesterday, and I'm not a big Twitter guy, but I was... God bless Rand Paul, and I hope that he's recovering well.
[03:09:46.623 --> 03:09:49.685]  But, I mean, what struck me was that he was mowing his own lawn.
[03:09:50.085 --> 03:09:54.928]  How many Democratic leaders in the United States of America pump their own gas, buy their own groceries, mow their own lawn?
[03:09:54.948 --> 03:09:56.589]  They're completely disconnected.
[03:09:56.709 --> 03:09:57.289]  Exactly.
[03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:59.791]  I mean, most of the Democrats are worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[03:09:59.991 --> 03:10:00.412]  We're good.
[03:10:17.170 --> 03:10:21.213]  Yeah, these people have lost their minds, and the worst thing they can do is disconnect.
[03:10:21.233 --> 03:10:29.479]  I mean, if I'm a Mexican-American, if I'm an African-American, if I'm a minority of any kind, I am not backing that party in any way, shape, or form.
[03:10:29.759 --> 03:10:34.303]  And if I'm a minority leader, I'm not necessarily, I'm not trying to get people to back me over there.
[03:10:34.323 --> 03:10:35.564]  I'm moving over to the other side.
[03:10:36.764 --> 03:10:38.946]  They are the ones killing their own party.
[03:10:39.026 --> 03:10:40.267]  Let's go to some phone calls.
[03:10:40.827 --> 03:10:42.348]  Let's go to, who's been holding the longest?
[03:10:42.429 --> 03:10:44.150]  Brian in North Carolina, then Sue.
[03:10:44.510 --> 03:10:45.491]  Brian, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:10:47.014 --> 03:10:49.057]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:10:49.077 --> 03:10:50.680]  You bet.
[03:10:50.720 --> 03:10:53.324]  First thing I wanted to tell you was venison iodine.
[03:10:54.045 --> 03:11:01.157]  I found out it's great for abscesses on the gum line, like if you have an abscess or a finger sore.
[03:11:02.159 --> 03:11:04.741]  The nascent iodine is awesome for that.
[03:11:04.842 --> 03:11:06.403]  Well that's why we put it in the toothpaste.
[03:11:06.984 --> 03:11:08.605]  Again, without iodine you die.
[03:11:08.985 --> 03:11:13.550]  There's just all these toxic forms out there that are just topical and still do some good.
[03:11:14.070 --> 03:11:16.472]  Ours is the deep earth pure source in the toothpaste.
[03:11:16.732 --> 03:11:18.975]  So thank you, but that's why we put it in the toothpaste.
[03:11:19.715 --> 03:11:20.496]  Yeah, it's great stuff.
[03:11:21.116 --> 03:11:24.600]  Originally I wanted to call about the Texas Shooter.
[03:11:25.527 --> 03:11:34.014]  And I guess initially I would have mentioned I am an atheist, but I got to tell you, I love my Christians, and I'll tell you why.
[03:11:34.695 --> 03:11:40.019]  Because I'd rather stand beside somebody who's going to pray for me than somebody who's going to pray on me.
[03:11:41.770 --> 03:11:43.911]  And that's the simplest I can put it.
[03:11:44.071 --> 03:11:45.231]  I gotta steal that saying.
[03:11:45.311 --> 03:11:48.313]  I'm gonna stand by somebody that's gonna pray for me instead of pray on me.
[03:11:48.553 --> 03:11:55.575]  And listen, I know there are diverse atheists who are brought up in oppressive churches or other religious stuff that are total cults and are dangerous and bad.
[03:11:55.875 --> 03:11:56.796]  You have a total right.
[03:11:56.916 --> 03:11:57.736]  I respect that.
[03:11:58.136 --> 03:12:00.957]  I understand why a lot of people are agnostic or atheist.
[03:12:01.358 --> 03:12:10.101]  That said, the liberal fake atheist that hates Christians, just like the Dylann Roof scumbag that killed the nine black people and then all whites got blamed,
[03:12:10.541 --> 03:12:17.365]  I'm not blaming all atheists, but I'm saying the left, if this guy had been a Christian, they'd be blaming all Christians or other groups right now.
[03:12:18.466 --> 03:12:23.169]  Now, let me, I keep hearing everybody ask, why is this happening?
[03:12:23.209 --> 03:12:24.129]  Why is this going on?
[03:12:24.709 --> 03:12:26.270]  This is all very simple.
[03:12:26.711 --> 03:12:36.236]  If you look at the source or the sources, the global sources that we talk about every day, George Soros, our most formative years are in our youth.
[03:12:36.777 --> 03:12:38.798]  He was brought up as a Hitler youth.
[03:12:39.904 --> 03:12:40.585]  Am I correct?
[03:12:40.605 --> 03:12:40.785]  Yes.
[03:13:03.321 --> 03:13:08.444]  That's true, but now they're specifically bypassing the NGOs and going right to the Christian churches.
[03:13:08.745 --> 03:13:11.186]  I got a jump, Ryan, but it shows how informed you are.
[03:13:11.486 --> 03:13:12.367]  Thank you for the support.
[03:13:12.907 --> 03:13:14.348]  Let's talk to Sue in Kansas.
[03:13:14.368 --> 03:13:16.089]  You're only here with Matt Dubiel and myself.
[03:13:16.149 --> 03:13:16.369]  Go ahead.
[03:13:17.639 --> 03:13:24.381]  Hey, I'm watching you on the very first 24-7 InfoWars TV channel, KGPT-26.
[03:13:24.961 --> 03:13:25.301]  Yeah!
[03:13:25.581 --> 03:13:26.181]  Well, you know what?
[03:13:26.401 --> 03:13:34.643]  I'm not good at promoting our affiliates because I'm so busy on air, but we have a lot of TV stations and cable systems picking us up now, and I need to do a better job of promoting these.
[03:13:34.703 --> 03:13:38.044]  In fact, I knew about that station the last few months in Kansas.
[03:13:39.104 --> 03:13:40.625]  Tell folks the call letters and everything again.
[03:13:40.645 --> 03:13:43.306]  KGPT-26, Wichita.
[03:13:46.052 --> 03:13:46.953]  That's right, I knew about that.
[03:13:47.273 --> 03:13:49.495]  I mean, so many exciting things are happening right now.
[03:13:49.815 --> 03:13:50.916]  Go ahead.
[03:13:52.037 --> 03:13:52.457]  Okay.
[03:13:53.098 --> 03:13:58.622]  I saw on Fox News this morning that Devin Kelly was wearing one of those skull masks.
[03:13:59.883 --> 03:14:09.591]  And it took me back to over the weekend when I was looking at Laura Loomer's Twitter page, and she had retweeted a picture from a 4chan posting
[03:14:12.560 --> 03:14:19.284]  That shows several guys in these school masks dressed in black and camo holding rifles and some weird looking flag.
[03:14:19.765 --> 03:14:23.247]  And at the bottom it says, watch the news for Texas tomorrow.
[03:14:23.347 --> 03:14:24.648]  Something big is coming.
[03:14:25.368 --> 03:14:27.269]  So they posted this on Friday.
[03:14:27.289 --> 03:14:37.936]  And I know when we were watching Owen on Saturday, a couple of different people called in a man and a woman saying to be aware that something was supposed to be happening yesterday.
[03:14:37.956 --> 03:14:37.996]  So.
[03:14:40.064 --> 03:14:42.766]  I don't, you know, instead of Saturday, you know what I mean?
[03:14:43.166 --> 03:14:43.426]  Sure.
[03:14:43.446 --> 03:14:46.669]  Well, let me go pull up Laura Loomer's Twitter.
[03:14:46.689 --> 03:14:48.049]  She does a great job reporting.
[03:14:48.370 --> 03:14:49.671]  She's out there as an independent reporter.
[03:14:49.711 --> 03:14:52.352]  We certainly look at a lot of her work and look at that.
[03:14:52.873 --> 03:14:58.597]  I know that his LinkedIn and other sites, he was basically like an atheist, globalist, anti-Christian guy.
[03:14:58.617 --> 03:14:59.977]  So thank you so much, Sue.
[03:15:00.658 --> 03:15:02.079]  What do you think motivated this guy?
[03:15:02.099 --> 03:15:03.039]  I mean, I think it was 50-50.
[03:15:03.080 --> 03:15:03.920]  Doesn't like Christians.
[03:15:03.940 --> 03:15:06.502]  You know, he got the whole Antifa thing going.
[03:15:06.542 --> 03:15:07.883]  So killed two birds with one stone.
[03:15:08.203 --> 03:15:09.624]  Doesn't like his mother-in-law.
[03:15:10.264 --> 03:15:10.484]  Matt?
[03:15:12.685 --> 03:15:15.846]  Yeah, you know, the old mother-in-law's excuse?
[03:15:16.607 --> 03:15:18.567]  The guys off his rocker, number one.
[03:15:19.027 --> 03:15:28.671]  And everybody that wants to lump him in with some other group, whether it be white males or whatever, they should just extrapolate that and go, the guy's nutso to begin with.
[03:15:29.031 --> 03:15:31.213]  He's probably on some psychotropics.
[03:15:31.253 --> 03:15:32.493]  He's probably on something.
[03:15:32.533 --> 03:15:33.714]  I'm sure that that will come up.
[03:15:33.934 --> 03:15:35.275]  That's one of the first things I want to know.
[03:15:35.295 --> 03:15:41.619]  Whenever I hear about these people, it seems to me they end up being on something because they're depressed or something's going on with them.
[03:15:41.679 --> 03:15:42.140]  That's right.
[03:15:42.180 --> 03:15:42.520]  All right.
[03:15:42.540 --> 03:15:44.701]  Matt Dubio is taking over right now.
[03:15:44.761 --> 03:15:47.403]  And then coming up, 3 o'clock, Owen Schroeder, The War Room.
[03:15:47.423 --> 03:15:48.243]  Don't forget, 8 a.m.
[03:15:48.283 --> 03:15:53.387]  every morning, David Knight in the Real News, hard-hitting analysis information with David Knight, 8 a.m.
[03:15:53.487 --> 03:15:55.368]  as well, newswars.com.
[03:15:55.788 --> 03:15:56.709]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:56.729 --> 03:15:58.090]  We'll be back from Chicago.
[03:16:03.562 --> 03:16:13.427]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[03:16:14.228 --> 03:16:23.593]  And today we see the leftists, the globalists, controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[03:16:23.993 --> 03:16:26.955]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[03:16:27.555 --> 03:16:37.239]  Clothing is a statement, and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud, just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[03:16:37.699 --> 03:16:42.881]  So right now, folks, we're gonna debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the InfoWars store.
[03:16:43.961 --> 03:16:45.702]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[03:16:45.762 --> 03:16:46.682]  It's a limited edition.
[03:16:47.262 --> 03:16:49.243]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[03:16:49.463 --> 03:16:56.205]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[03:16:56.545 --> 03:17:00.726]  On the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[03:17:00.966 --> 03:17:02.467]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows
[03:17:02.987 --> 03:17:03.427]  We're good to go.
[03:17:24.540 --> 03:17:25.121]  Says it all.
[03:17:25.241 --> 03:17:26.122]  Need I say more?
[03:17:26.622 --> 03:17:28.224]  You want to have a political message out there?
[03:17:28.264 --> 03:17:34.049]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[03:17:34.370 --> 03:17:37.453]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[03:17:37.893 --> 03:17:43.478]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[03:17:44.199 --> 03:17:46.520]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[03:17:46.840 --> 03:17:55.243]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[03:17:55.483 --> 03:17:59.065]  And this shirt, in the spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[03:17:59.885 --> 03:18:09.376]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Labe, or Come and Take It, in good old-fashioned English, t-shirts.
[03:18:09.516 --> 03:18:11.999]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[03:18:12.380 --> 03:18:14.021]  InfoWars.com to spread the word.
[03:18:14.742 --> 03:18:15.843]  I designed this baby.
[03:18:15.923 --> 03:18:18.345]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[03:18:18.725 --> 03:18:22.988]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[03:18:23.389 --> 03:18:27.232]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[03:18:27.632 --> 03:18:30.334]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[03:18:30.354 --> 03:18:31.755]  It's been around about 19 years.
[03:18:32.375 --> 03:18:35.958]  It's the classic InfoWars tyranny response team shirt.
[03:18:36.238 --> 03:18:39.341]  And of course we've seen the NFL taking a knee.
[03:18:40.262 --> 03:18:43.846]  Uh, daring the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[03:18:44.567 --> 03:18:45.448]  That's disrespectful.
[03:18:45.468 --> 03:18:49.492]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[03:18:49.552 --> 03:18:57.001]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[03:18:57.422 --> 03:18:58.843]  Our republic is in distress.
[03:18:59.324 --> 03:18:59.804]  Ask me why.
[03:19:00.465 --> 03:19:02.366]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[03:19:02.526 --> 03:19:08.048]  Good old camouflage with the Dayglo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Horse.
[03:19:08.508 --> 03:19:09.988]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[03:19:10.068 --> 03:19:13.029]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go out and put another shirt on.
[03:19:13.489 --> 03:19:15.630]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[03:19:16.270 --> 03:19:18.511]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[03:19:19.212 --> 03:19:20.013]  It's all about freedom.
[03:19:20.053 --> 03:19:21.374]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[03:19:21.915 --> 03:19:22.836]  Resist Tyranny.
[03:19:23.476 --> 03:19:24.457]  Made in America.
[03:19:24.477 --> 03:19:24.457]  1776.
[03:19:24.998 --> 03:19:28.181]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[03:19:28.401 --> 03:19:29.382]  The backs are really cool.
[03:19:29.722 --> 03:19:30.403]  Look at that back.
[03:19:30.463 --> 03:19:31.384]  That is pure Americana.
[03:19:32.597 --> 03:19:37.738]  And I almost forgot, we've got dozens and dozens of great limited edition ball caps available.
[03:19:37.858 --> 03:19:38.538]  The Dayglo.
[03:19:39.059 --> 03:19:43.140]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[03:19:43.300 --> 03:19:44.920]  This is my favorite ball cap.
[03:19:45.300 --> 03:19:46.620]  Over 20 ball caps we've put out.
[03:19:46.860 --> 03:19:47.921]  It's got the nice patch.
[03:19:48.241 --> 03:19:49.281]  Infowars.com.
[03:19:49.521 --> 03:19:50.401]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[03:19:50.661 --> 03:19:54.102]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[03:19:54.502 --> 03:19:56.083]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[03:19:56.343 --> 03:20:01.184]  Thank you all for your support and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:20:05.706 --> 03:20:08.509]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:09.310 --> 03:20:20.581]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:26.331 --> 03:20:30.714]  From Chicago, it's Matt Dubiel filling in for Alex Jones from the WCKG studios.
[03:20:31.414 --> 03:20:34.156]  Thanks for listening to InfoWars all day long.
[03:20:34.216 --> 03:20:36.197]  Now, there's been some changes at InfoWars.
[03:20:36.217 --> 03:20:38.139]  There's been some additions, new shows.
[03:20:38.519 --> 03:20:40.921]  You got Real News with David Knight and The War Room.
[03:20:40.981 --> 03:20:45.784]  And those shows are so important, and now more than ever, that we've actually added those.
[03:20:46.484 --> 03:20:47.285]  To our lineup here.
[03:20:47.325 --> 03:20:49.827]  So in Chicago, we're wall-to-wall with InfoWars.
[03:20:50.407 --> 03:20:52.669]  Because here, we truly are on the front lines.
[03:20:53.089 --> 03:21:08.440]  While there is terrible, tragic news in Texas, and terrible, tragic news, I mean, pretty much you could throw a dart at the United States map, and no matter where you're gonna hit, there's something going on in the country that needs our attention.
[03:21:08.761 --> 03:21:14.245]  Whether it's fires, whether it's hurricane relief, whether it's gunshots, Chicago,
[03:21:15.106 --> 03:21:19.870]  It's Las Vegas every month in Chicago and I'm going to repeat it until I'm blue in the face.
[03:21:19.930 --> 03:21:30.561]  I'm going to repeat it every time I have the good pleasure to sit in here for Alex for the fourth hour because in September there were 59 deaths in Chicago from gunshots.
[03:21:31.121 --> 03:21:37.988]  Now you might expect if you were on the left that I might use this as an argument for gun control.
[03:21:38.928 --> 03:21:48.751]  You might expect that 59 gunshot deaths in Chicago would be an argument for comprehensive gun law reform or comprehensive universal.
[03:21:49.012 --> 03:21:50.132]  They like to use those words.
[03:21:50.472 --> 03:21:52.473]  Comprehensive and universal.
[03:21:52.513 --> 03:21:53.673]  And there's a reason for that.
[03:21:54.373 --> 03:21:56.634]  Because a lot of people are confused by that stuff.
[03:21:56.674 --> 03:21:57.675]  It makes it sound important.
[03:21:57.695 --> 03:22:01.176]  It makes it sound like those people that are elected to office are doing something.
[03:22:01.576 --> 03:22:04.137]  We had a senator in Illinois, Dick Durbin,
[03:22:04.617 --> 03:22:07.179]  Who has been in office since Christ was a corporal.
[03:22:07.799 --> 03:22:10.942]  And I don't know why he keeps getting elected into office.
[03:22:10.982 --> 03:22:12.323]  Actually, I do know why.
[03:22:12.363 --> 03:22:15.345]  It's because it's Illinois and Chicago and that's how the machine works.
[03:22:15.705 --> 03:22:21.189]  But he hit the radio this morning and he immediately started talking about universal background checks.
[03:22:21.949 --> 03:22:23.210]  Universal background checks.
[03:22:24.331 --> 03:22:27.153]  59 people shot and killed in Chicago in September.
[03:22:27.413 --> 03:22:31.176]  There were 58 people that were killed in Las Vegas.
[03:22:31.876 --> 03:22:33.077]  In the Las Vegas massacre.
[03:22:34.095 --> 03:22:41.139]  This is a competition I don't want to win, but Chicago won the death toll competition, sadly, in September.
[03:22:41.619 --> 03:22:46.541]  And Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, all the Jimmys, didn't cry for Chicago.
[03:22:47.082 --> 03:22:49.483]  There have so far been 3,197 people shot this year.
[03:22:49.503 --> 03:22:51.023]  Not killed, just shot.
[03:22:51.043 --> 03:22:51.884]  Just shot.
[03:22:51.904 --> 03:22:52.964]  3,197 in Chicago in 2017.
[03:23:02.873 --> 03:23:03.373]  We have.
[03:23:03.393 --> 03:23:05.354]  I mean, we do live in amazing times.
[03:23:05.374 --> 03:23:07.415]  You'll hear Alex talk about it all the time.
[03:23:07.435 --> 03:23:08.676]  We live in amazing times.
[03:23:08.716 --> 03:23:10.456]  We live in very amazing times.
[03:23:10.516 --> 03:23:12.677]  We can zip things on the Internet.
[03:23:12.717 --> 03:23:13.998]  We can send information.
[03:23:14.058 --> 03:23:14.318]  We can.
[03:23:14.478 --> 03:23:16.579]  We all have television studios in our pockets.
[03:23:17.420 --> 03:23:18.640]  We live in amazing times.
[03:23:18.700 --> 03:23:23.882]  We can share likes and and comments with people on the other side of the planet.
[03:23:24.223 --> 03:23:27.444]  We can share pictures of our grandchildren or kids with the grandparents.
[03:23:28.004 --> 03:23:29.165]  And yet we're still
[03:23:30.040 --> 03:23:34.084]  Turning up with 3,100 people that are getting shot in the streets of Chicago.
[03:23:34.124 --> 03:23:34.804]  Why is that?
[03:23:36.746 --> 03:23:41.750]  Why is that when you have a mayor that says he's gonna fix it and a governor that says he's gonna fix it?
[03:23:42.171 --> 03:23:44.313]  And one is a Republican and one is a Democrat.
[03:23:44.333 --> 03:23:45.153]  It can't be the parties.
[03:23:47.155 --> 03:23:47.756]  Why is that?
[03:23:48.116 --> 03:23:51.059]  Why are there so many problems in the United States of America?
[03:23:51.980 --> 03:23:52.300]  I think
[03:23:53.251 --> 03:23:57.174]  It's because we have too much time in the United States of America.
[03:23:57.234 --> 03:24:03.698]  I think it's because most people spend their time doing things that don't do anything in the United States of America.
[03:24:05.660 --> 03:24:09.282]  Most people think that the heroes are only firemen.
[03:24:10.083 --> 03:24:16.367]  I happen to think that the heroes are everyday Americans, middle class Americans, people like you and I, like those two men.
[03:24:16.928 --> 03:24:22.732]  God bless those two guys in Texas that stopped a lunatic, a lunatic that
[03:24:23.760 --> 03:24:34.826]  took up firearms and went to a church on Sunday when people that he knew were worshiping, vulnerable, in front of God.
[03:24:36.147 --> 03:24:39.169]  And he took firearms there to harm them.
[03:24:40.208 --> 03:24:53.597]  For some personal vendetta, some theological vendetta, and now it's coming out, if you believe what you read online, that he's tried bribing underage girls to date him, this guy.
[03:24:54.378 --> 03:24:55.438]  I'm not gonna say his name.
[03:24:56.799 --> 03:24:59.081]  He doesn't deserve to have his name spoken.
[03:25:00.208 --> 03:25:03.370]  You know, they do that in the Harry Potter series where they won't say the bad guy's name.
[03:25:03.690 --> 03:25:05.331]  They say, he who shall not be mentioned.
[03:25:05.851 --> 03:25:07.211]  Somebody I saw somebody tweeted.
[03:25:07.792 --> 03:25:10.013]  My Twitter is at Matt on air if you're on Twitter.
[03:25:10.193 --> 03:25:24.280]  And by the way, I'm going to get to the Twitter connection to Las Vegas and the Twitter connection to the problems in the United States and the Twitter connection to the economy and the Twitter connection to CNN and the New York Times and the Twitter connection to our president.
[03:25:25.160 --> 03:25:26.401]  And not all the connections are good.
[03:25:27.202 --> 03:25:31.445]  But I've been on Twitter since like 2006 and only got on it because I'm in the media.
[03:25:32.266 --> 03:25:37.970]  For the most part, regular everyday people, if I was a regular, if I was not in the media, I would not be fooling around on Twitter.
[03:25:38.631 --> 03:25:39.651]  I would have no reason for it.
[03:25:40.092 --> 03:25:43.995]  Makes sense for people in the media to get on Twitter and share information and share news stories.
[03:25:44.535 --> 03:25:50.579]  Now it makes more sense for regular people all over to share things and connect because you can communicate there.
[03:25:51.040 --> 03:25:56.464]  But by and large, it's mostly used by elite media people like Anderson Cooper.
[03:25:57.228 --> 03:25:58.189]  And maybe Donna Brazile.
[03:25:58.209 --> 03:25:59.670]  And we'll get to her, too, coming up.
[03:26:00.291 --> 03:26:02.033]  But there's something going on with Twitter.
[03:26:02.613 --> 03:26:04.435]  And there's something going on with Las Vegas.
[03:26:06.977 --> 03:26:13.483]  And the real story, in my mind, is the American heroes in Texas.
[03:26:13.803 --> 03:26:15.505]  This is one of the cool things about Texas.
[03:26:16.185 --> 03:26:19.909]  Texans remember that we're all together.
[03:26:20.675 --> 03:26:24.117]  And Americans are neighbors, we're family, we're brothers, we're sisters.
[03:26:24.877 --> 03:26:33.941]  And two American patriots took up arms, they took up pickup trucks, they took up whatever they could to go and make sure that this bad guy was stopped immediately.
[03:26:34.661 --> 03:26:39.784]  In small towns in middle America where there's only 500 people, sometimes there isn't a big police force.
[03:26:40.344 --> 03:26:44.806]  Sometimes the police, if there are some, aren't going to make it there anytime soon.
[03:26:46.201 --> 03:26:47.081]  That's a big reason.
[03:26:47.101 --> 03:26:50.643]  That's a big part of the reason why 3,100 people are shot in Chicago.
[03:26:51.183 --> 03:26:55.024]  By the time the gunshot thing happens, the police, you know, they can't even get there.
[03:26:56.085 --> 03:27:01.807]  And I have friends, people I love dearly that are police officers, retired police officers.
[03:27:02.887 --> 03:27:03.407]  Guess what?
[03:27:04.628 --> 03:27:10.770]  They've been de-panced by the president, the previous president, Barack Obama.
[03:27:10.790 --> 03:27:14.291]  They've been de-panced by the media, where they've been paralyzed.
[03:27:15.396 --> 03:27:23.200]  Because if they do their job, immediately afterwards they're called into question about their ethics, about their motives, about their profiling.
[03:27:24.781 --> 03:27:26.822]  So who are you going to call when things go bad?
[03:27:26.842 --> 03:27:28.862]  Who are you going to call when it hits the fan?
[03:27:29.163 --> 03:27:33.785]  You're going to call the cops that you bastardize and demonize for doing their jobs?
[03:27:34.785 --> 03:27:35.966]  Those are the guys that you're going to call?
[03:27:38.513 --> 03:27:42.716]  Imagine, imagine if every time you did your job, somebody gave you grief.
[03:27:43.337 --> 03:27:49.021]  Imagine if every time you did your job, somebody held it over your head and said, well, maybe we're going to put you in jail.
[03:27:51.323 --> 03:27:54.606]  Maybe the cops need a little bit of better training in some situations.
[03:27:54.666 --> 03:27:57.148]  Yes, maybe there are some bad apples in some areas.
[03:27:58.249 --> 03:28:05.735]  But to nationally and locally shame the police officers, and then after that, to suggest
[03:28:07.060 --> 03:28:31.845]  That we make it illegal for law-abiding American citizens to take up arms and protect themselves, be it from bad guys, be it from, uh, be it for hunting, be it from tyrannical governments, to suggest that we take their arms away and then have the police paralyzed would leave you vulnerable.
[03:28:33.089 --> 03:28:34.450]  And you're already under attack.
[03:28:35.191 --> 03:28:37.332]  The middle class is already under attack.
[03:28:41.136 --> 03:28:45.079]  You're not gonna have a chance if you don't have your firearms and you don't have your police.
[03:28:46.260 --> 03:28:48.101]  We're gonna talk about the Twitter connection.
[03:28:48.141 --> 03:28:50.623]  We'll talk about why Donna Brazile wants you to be her friend.
[03:28:51.324 --> 03:28:52.044]  We'll get into that.
[03:28:52.064 --> 03:28:54.486]  We are on the march.
[03:29:02.785 --> 03:29:04.166]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:29:04.446 --> 03:29:05.726]  You can't survive without it.
[03:29:05.926 --> 03:29:06.827]  But where do you get it?
[03:29:07.127 --> 03:29:12.869]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:29:13.109 --> 03:29:18.831]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:29:19.031 --> 03:29:35.915]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:29:36.295 --> 03:29:38.417]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:29:38.777 --> 03:29:39.958]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:29:40.238 --> 03:29:40.999]  Easy assembly.
[03:29:41.279 --> 03:29:41.900]  Low maintenance.
[03:29:42.200 --> 03:29:44.022]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:30:03.579 --> 03:30:10.222]  The model of a true on-the-ground, but also in the research, investigative journalist, James O'Keefe.
[03:30:10.402 --> 03:30:15.165]  This is a guy at YouTube who is, quote, brand and diversity curation at YouTube.
[03:30:15.485 --> 03:30:16.685]  This is self-described.
[03:30:16.705 --> 03:30:17.746]  His name is Ernie Petit.
[03:30:17.786 --> 03:30:22.788]  He, quote, works on the team that provides human inputs into a lot of the machinery at YouTube.
[03:30:22.828 --> 03:30:23.729]  This is what he says.
[03:30:24.269 --> 03:30:25.790]  The so-called news carousel.
[03:30:25.830 --> 03:30:27.771]  These are the trending videos about news.
[03:30:28.211 --> 03:30:30.252]  He's one of the few people at YouTube that actually
[03:30:30.892 --> 03:30:38.837]  ...is part of the so-called human inputs, he calls it, where he adjusts the way the videos are seen.
[03:30:38.897 --> 03:30:57.789]  This guy Ernie is sitting at the table wearing a Black Lives Matter sweater with Google emblazoned on the sleeve, and he's talking about the relationships he has with people at Huffington Post, New York Times, and Black Lives Matter, and how he gives preferential treatment to these news companies, as opposed to citizen journalists like you and I. This New York Times reporter he's referring to, his name is Nick Dudick,
[03:30:58.229 --> 03:31:00.090]  He's the subject of the first video that we did.
[03:31:00.110 --> 03:31:01.670]  This is an unbelievable video.
[03:31:02.070 --> 03:31:06.572]  The New York Times reporter says that he is targeting Trump's businesses.
[03:31:06.632 --> 03:31:08.572]  He's trying to boycott Trump's businesses.
[03:31:08.973 --> 03:31:13.914]  He brings information to the front of the New York Times' pages that are more negative.
[03:31:14.074 --> 03:31:18.836]  I target his businesses, his dumb s**t of a son.
[03:31:19.996 --> 03:31:20.796]  Donald Jr.
[03:31:20.916 --> 03:31:24.638]  and Eric, so they're running Trump, like the Trump business.
[03:31:24.758 --> 03:31:25.738]  Target that.
[03:31:26.679 --> 03:31:29.940]  Get people to boycott going to his hotels.
[03:31:32.221 --> 03:31:44.325]  Boycott, so a lot of the Trump brands, if you can ruin the Trump brand, and you put pressure on his business, and you start investigating his business, and you start shutting it down, whether hacking or other things.
[03:31:45.333 --> 03:31:47.395]  He cares about his business more than he cares about being president.
[03:31:47.575 --> 03:31:49.757]  We confirm suspicions at Veritas.
[03:31:49.797 --> 03:31:56.002]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[03:31:56.422 --> 03:31:59.124]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[03:31:59.565 --> 03:32:01.146]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[03:32:01.186 --> 03:32:03.007]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[03:32:03.047 --> 03:32:10.673]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him and manually have to find that video.
[03:32:10.693 --> 03:32:13.656]  We're not going to allow that video if it gets 10 million views.
[03:32:14.036 --> 03:32:16.078]  To be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[03:32:16.198 --> 03:32:28.770]  I mean let's just be like that's what the like that's what that news carousel kind of does so like it's above the search results so at the very least we can say that like
[03:32:31.704 --> 03:32:38.609]  This shelf of videos from news programs is legitimate news, because we know that these are legitimate news organizations.
[03:32:39.470 --> 03:32:46.856]  And if at that point somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones, well, they were looking for him to begin with anyway.
[03:32:47.136 --> 03:32:55.622]  Everybody should go to ProjectVeritas.com and should donate, because I know if they had more money they could do more, just like we could do, but you need to go to them and support them today.
[03:32:55.662 --> 03:32:56.743]  This is incredible.
[03:32:56.963 --> 03:32:58.324]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:32:58.364 --> 03:33:00.186]  The truth is striking back.
[03:33:05.578 --> 03:33:10.122]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.476 --> 03:33:29.140]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:31.866 --> 03:33:32.526]  I'm not Alex.
[03:33:33.647 --> 03:33:36.168]  Do not adjust your screen if you're listening on the radio.
[03:33:36.228 --> 03:33:38.929]  God bless you if you're not listening on the radio in Chicago.
[03:33:38.969 --> 03:33:41.310]  Start listening to WCKG.
[03:33:41.350 --> 03:33:50.054]  My name is Matt Dubiel in for Alex for the fourth hour today from Chicago, from his radio hub here in Chicago, which is AM 1530 WCKG FM 102.3.
[03:33:53.475 --> 03:33:58.120]  Chicago is the place where, in October, there were 47 gunshot deaths.
[03:33:58.460 --> 03:33:59.121]  In September, 59.
[03:33:59.321 --> 03:34:04.286]  It is Las Vegas, sadly, every month here in Chicago.
[03:34:04.886 --> 03:34:08.390]  I want to tell you about something that is really going to make your day.
[03:34:11.092 --> 03:34:16.978]  But quickly, if anybody can pull this up on my Twitter feed, mine is at Matt on air on Twitter.
[03:34:19.262 --> 03:34:31.646]  I just retweeted, Liz Crokin shared the pictures of President Barack Obama when he visited, I think it was Japan, and then now President Donald Trump when he visited Japan.
[03:34:32.186 --> 03:34:36.648]  And if you can see them, you'll see a notable difference.
[03:34:37.388 --> 03:34:46.799]  You have, you know, and I don't know if Barack Obama never watched The Karate Kid, but when you bow, it's my understanding you're supposed to look high.
[03:34:46.860 --> 03:34:48.101]  At least that's what Mr. Miyagi said.
[03:34:48.141 --> 03:34:48.541]  Look high!
[03:34:48.742 --> 03:34:49.803]  Always look high!
[03:34:50.344 --> 03:34:54.629]  And Barack just went for the full bend over, facing down.
[03:34:55.149 --> 03:34:56.510]  I don't know if that was out of habit.
[03:34:56.570 --> 03:34:58.051]  I don't know why he was doing that.
[03:34:58.711 --> 03:34:59.832]  But now look at the picture.
[03:34:59.932 --> 03:35:03.154]  If you're watching, go to Infowars.com slash show.
[03:35:03.554 --> 03:35:05.516]  Infowars.com slash show on the internet.
[03:35:05.776 --> 03:35:06.456]  Share that link.
[03:35:06.516 --> 03:35:07.177]  Share it on Twitter.
[03:35:07.197 --> 03:35:07.937]  Share it on Facebook.
[03:35:07.977 --> 03:35:19.284]  And you see a very commanding, very presidential American man and a very proud Japanese... I think he's the Japanese Prime Minister.
[03:35:21.122 --> 03:35:26.430]  And they're shaking each other's hands like men, looking at each other in the eye.
[03:35:26.811 --> 03:35:28.493]  It's very refreshing to me.
[03:35:28.914 --> 03:35:32.780]  Now, I'm still going to watch the President very carefully.
[03:35:33.200 --> 03:35:36.125]  I'm not going to put him up on a pedestal, but I will say to you,
[03:35:36.605 --> 03:35:48.593]  That it's very encouraging and very exciting to have a president who carries himself as a president despite what the media, the bought and paid for media would have you believe.
[03:35:48.973 --> 03:35:59.220]  I said that we were going to talk a little bit about Twitter and it's been my experience that when it comes to social media, regular people like you and I for the most part are not on Twitter.
[03:35:59.913 --> 03:36:04.815]  I joined Twitter back in 2006, in the early days, back when I didn't have as much gray hair.
[03:36:04.855 --> 03:36:10.237]  And I did that because I work in radio and I work in the media, and we try to stay on top of things like that.
[03:36:10.517 --> 03:36:25.002]  But for the most part, most of the people, it's even come out in the news that Twitter has inflated their user statistics, they've inflated their follower counts, there's many bots, there's many computers that pretend to be followers and things.
[03:36:25.662 --> 03:36:33.426]  And Twitter is mostly used by elite media superstars like Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin and other people.
[03:36:33.486 --> 03:36:45.833]  Now, it was very curious to me in the beginning that, and by the way, I remember, I will not forget, I have something important to tell you that you're going to want to know, and I'm just saving it for in a minute because I want to prove a point.
[03:36:46.854 --> 03:36:51.316]  Twitter was the darling of the mainstream media, specifically television.
[03:36:51.977 --> 03:36:54.058]  And for years and years, it didn't make money.
[03:36:54.398 --> 03:37:05.224]  And it was curious to me that the major money behind Twitter was this prince, this guy, this Alawid, Prince something Alawid from Saudi Arabia.
[03:37:05.684 --> 03:37:11.206]  And I would watch and hear the news about this Prince Alawid and be like, well, what is this guy doing?
[03:37:11.247 --> 03:37:13.187]  And why is he investing in this dog?
[03:37:13.628 --> 03:37:14.608]  Twitter is a dog.
[03:37:14.688 --> 03:37:18.110]  As investments go, I'm no EF Hutton.
[03:37:18.670 --> 03:37:20.992]  But, uh, I would not invest in Twitter.
[03:37:21.032 --> 03:37:24.856]  The company doesn't make any money, and it's got nothing but problems.
[03:37:25.176 --> 03:37:29.219]  The best thing to happen to Twitter has been the president, like, you know, in many other arenas.
[03:37:30.260 --> 03:37:36.606]  So I thought, why would this, why would this Alaweed, this Prince Alaweed, go into, uh, invest in Twitter?
[03:37:36.646 --> 03:37:39.948]  By the way, he owns big parts of Citigroup.
[03:37:40.089 --> 03:37:44.012]  So if you take your wallet out, you know, you see those commercials, what's in your wallet?
[03:37:44.332 --> 03:37:45.173]  What's in your wallet?
[03:37:45.593 --> 03:37:48.255]  Are you financing Prince Alawede's shenanigans?
[03:37:48.376 --> 03:37:51.478]  Because if you're with Citigroup, you may want to rethink that.
[03:37:51.518 --> 03:37:53.159]  You may want to kind of restructure that.
[03:37:53.440 --> 03:37:55.982]  It's time for the middle class to start doing stuff like that.
[03:37:56.302 --> 03:37:59.104]  I'd say get off Twitter, but most people are not on Twitter.
[03:37:59.425 --> 03:38:07.151]  Most people in middle America, like you and I, if you're on social media at all, you're on Facebook or you're not on it at all.
[03:38:07.691 --> 03:38:14.257]  And it's probably not a bad idea to stay the heck away from that stuff, unless of course you're sharing the links from InfoWars and stuff like that.
[03:38:15.037 --> 03:38:20.820]  I mentioned that I want to tell you about something that is very excellent news and here's why I waited a second.
[03:38:21.661 --> 03:38:38.830]  I started taking Brain Force a couple of weeks ago and I started taking it because Matthew Raybourn here is an intern and helps us with news stories along with Jim and Matthew was raving about Brain Force and I was like, get out of here, come on, you think this stuff is really that big of a deal?
[03:38:38.890 --> 03:38:40.011]  I mean, I figure it's okay.
[03:38:40.351 --> 03:38:41.492]  He says, no man, you got to try it.
[03:38:41.992 --> 03:38:43.813]  So I got some Brain Force.
[03:38:44.612 --> 03:38:46.433]  And it is fantastic.
[03:38:46.694 --> 03:38:47.334]  It helps you.
[03:38:47.374 --> 03:38:50.376]  I drink a lot of coffee, kind of dial back the coffee a little bit.
[03:38:50.997 --> 03:38:58.262]  And if you go to InfoWarsLife, InfoWarsStore.com for a limited time, there is a sale right now.
[03:38:59.162 --> 03:39:00.003]  It's a huge sale.

[03:39:01.264 --> 03:39:02.004]  Brain Force.

[03:39:08.203 --> 03:39:15.650]  I don't know how long that will be, but I know that they just started making the packaging a little bit bigger because it's people like it.
[03:39:16.390 --> 03:39:21.535]  If you've seen that movie Limitless, it kind of makes you feel like that movie Limitless except without
[03:39:22.270 --> 03:39:28.292]  Nonsense, and without the shakes or without the jitters or whatever happens to you from either taking drugs or taking coffee.
[03:39:28.332 --> 03:39:29.893]  This stuff in Brain Force is all natural.
[03:39:30.173 --> 03:39:31.193]  I've been taking it myself.
[03:39:31.874 --> 03:39:32.794]  My team here takes it.
[03:39:32.874 --> 03:39:36.275]  Everybody except for Jim, who I saw yawning today.
[03:39:36.415 --> 03:39:37.276]  I'm just saying he was yawning.
[03:39:37.896 --> 03:39:41.698]  So, Brain Force, 50% off, limited time only, infowarestore.com.
[03:39:42.098 --> 03:39:42.818]  Back to Twitter.
[03:39:43.982 --> 03:39:47.305]  I just want to track a series of events here and I don't have a lot of time.
[03:39:47.545 --> 03:39:51.968]  This time goes by quickly when you're filling in for Alex Jones from Chicago.
[03:39:52.349 --> 03:39:54.711]  Twitter has some curious things happening.
[03:39:55.131 --> 03:40:01.456]  Okay, so in the beginning nobody was using Twitter and what you noticed was CNN was pushing it hard, the mainstream media
[03:40:01.476 --> 03:40:02.496]  The media was pushing it hard.
[03:40:02.897 --> 03:40:05.178]  Every newscaster had it in the lower third.
[03:40:05.218 --> 03:40:06.838]  That's what they call the bottom of the screen.
[03:40:07.219 --> 03:40:18.383]  Like when they show me again on InfoWars and they put my name below me, if you're watching an InfoWars.com slash show, they'll say, it'll say Matt Dubiel and then I'll have my Twitter handle in there or my name or whatever.
[03:40:18.824 --> 03:40:20.284]  Well, that is called the lower third.
[03:40:20.744 --> 03:40:23.466]  In the lower third on all of these news outlets, there it is.
[03:40:23.946 --> 03:40:28.848]  In the lower third of all these news outlets, what you'll see is pretty much everyone's Twitter handle.
[03:40:29.970 --> 03:40:39.513]  And I have a feeling, if you start looking in the advertising logs of these networks, if they weren't getting money directly, they, maybe some of them, own pieces of Twitter.
[03:40:39.933 --> 03:40:45.034]  But an interesting thing happened in the wake of all the Twitter stuff.
[03:40:46.115 --> 03:40:53.637]  As I read it, the president's Twitter handle was taken down for 11 minutes, and they blamed some low-level employee.
[03:40:54.777 --> 03:40:57.038]  And then, a couple days later,
[03:40:57.932 --> 03:41:08.179]  Prince Alawede and a bunch of these other highfalutin royals were picked up by Saudi authorities and arrested and detained.
[03:41:09.200 --> 03:41:15.985]  It just seems coincidental to me that that happened following the Twitter outage for the president.
[03:41:17.186 --> 03:41:21.269]  And then I read somewhere, probably at Infowars.com, I read that
[03:41:22.473 --> 03:41:34.481]  Somebody, and I don't know if it was all a weed, or somebody in the Saudi hierarchy owns a couple of floors of the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas.
[03:41:36.440 --> 03:41:39.041]  And there's been a lot of talk about the President's Twitter.
[03:41:39.581 --> 03:41:41.682]  And there's been a lot of talk about tweeting.
[03:41:42.102 --> 03:41:44.163]  And there's been a lot of talk about Saudi Arabia.
[03:41:44.203 --> 03:41:51.125]  And I also seem to remember, I'm just trying to connect the dots here, because I don't keep up on the news as well as everybody else does.
[03:41:51.606 --> 03:42:03.130]  But I also seem to be reminded of something that happened with the Bushes way back when, where they were so tight with the Saudis that they called, like,
[03:42:03.715 --> 03:42:11.300]  George Bush or Bandar Bush, a Bush, like the families were so close, they nicknamed each other because they were so tight.
[03:42:11.900 --> 03:42:24.088]  And I seem to remember that during 9-11, there was a bunch of Saudis put on a plane and escorted out of the country in the wake of the biggest American tragedy since Pearl Harbor.
[03:42:24.328 --> 03:42:26.669]  They were put on the plane and shipped out of the United States.
[03:42:26.969 --> 03:42:32.673]  And here we have miraculous developments where it seems to me that deals are being struck.
[03:42:33.362 --> 03:42:39.307]  Whether they're with our president or without, whether with intelligence agencies or not, it seems like the tides are turning a bit.
[03:42:39.687 --> 03:42:41.549]  And it seems pretty damn exciting to me.
[03:42:41.569 --> 03:42:43.991]  I don't know about you, but we're going to talk more about that.
[03:42:44.251 --> 03:42:46.693]  And I'm going to share why you should watch out for Donna Brazile.
[03:42:46.753 --> 03:42:50.676]  I'm a little aware of her persuasion, as Scott Adams would say.
[03:43:02.108 --> 03:43:11.140]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:43:11.200 --> 03:43:19.311]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:43:19.611 --> 03:43:24.296]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:43:24.476 --> 03:43:31.183]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:43:31.283 --> 03:43:38.370]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:43:38.430 --> 03:43:45.313]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:43:45.453 --> 03:43:49.814]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[03:43:59.638 --> 03:44:01.299]  Available at Infowarslife.com.

[03:45:20.538 --> 03:45:25.564]  That we live in an environment that is just loaded with toxic chemicals.
[03:45:26.025 --> 03:45:32.172]  Now they're finding that that environment is actually affecting babies in the prenatal stage.
[03:45:32.472 --> 03:45:34.475]  Specifically when it comes to the telomeres.
[03:45:34.795 --> 03:45:39.381]  So now you have babies prematurely aging because of all the toxins.
[03:45:39.801 --> 03:45:41.302]  So what does InfoWars do, folks?

[03:47:05.040 --> 03:47:07.625]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:25.194 --> 03:47:29.077]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:47:29.558 --> 03:47:33.481]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:35.783 --> 03:47:37.584]  It's Matt Dubio filling in for Alex Jones.
[03:47:37.624 --> 03:47:42.988]  They call those liners in the business, and that liner is really important.
[03:47:43.389 --> 03:47:46.031]  It's one of those things where I know you hear it over and over again.
[03:47:46.664 --> 03:47:50.607]  But if you're hearing this, you are the resistance.
[03:47:50.708 --> 03:47:53.130]  Keith Olbermann is not the resistance.
[03:47:54.070 --> 03:47:55.091]  Have you seen Keith?
[03:47:55.211 --> 03:47:56.152]  I shouldn't even give his name.
[03:47:56.192 --> 03:47:58.574]  I shouldn't even give him any, flow him any power.
[03:47:59.115 --> 03:48:00.916]  But you are the resistance.
[03:48:01.116 --> 03:48:02.378]  You are what's important.
[03:48:03.078 --> 03:48:09.303]  And what you do in your family and what you do in the leadership in your community is what's important.
[03:48:09.664 --> 03:48:10.544]  It's very dangerous.
[03:48:10.564 --> 03:48:12.126]  We get into this partisan stuff.
[03:48:12.606 --> 03:48:20.362]  And I'm going to talk a little bit about an experience I had at Facebook today that was a little illuminating, and I want to talk about this Donna Brazile stuff.
[03:48:20.783 --> 03:48:23.429]  I'm in Chicago at the WCKG Studios.
[03:48:24.306 --> 03:48:29.189]  And we carry Alex's show, and we carry Real News in the morning, and we carry the War Room.
[03:48:29.209 --> 03:48:31.109]  And we broadcast that on AM 1530.
[03:48:31.510 --> 03:48:36.372]  So we would love to have you listen, because AM radio is very important if the internet gets shut down.
[03:48:36.412 --> 03:48:40.634]  And it looks like Anonymous predicted that there were going to be blackouts, and there are some today.
[03:48:40.934 --> 03:48:42.995]  We even had some issues here today, earlier.
[03:48:43.296 --> 03:48:51.520]  We had issues on Saturday during the November 4th Pixie event, where a bunch of, you know, Pixies were like, we're going to do some damage!
[03:48:52.240 --> 03:48:53.641]  And then they really didn't do much.
[03:48:53.822 --> 03:48:59.426]  But one of the things that happened to us was our radio station was knocked off the air.
[03:48:59.446 --> 03:49:01.788]  And it wasn't power and it wasn't internet.
[03:49:02.288 --> 03:49:03.349]  It was very unusual.
[03:49:03.369 --> 03:49:04.850]  I'm still trying to get to the bottom of it.
[03:49:04.910 --> 03:49:07.152]  It seemed like a coordinated thing.
[03:49:07.993 --> 03:49:10.575]  Maybe it had nothing to do with the Antifa stuff.
[03:49:10.615 --> 03:49:11.256]  Maybe it did.
[03:49:11.776 --> 03:49:14.498]  Maybe it has nothing to do with anything that's going on.
[03:49:14.558 --> 03:49:17.481]  But whether it does or doesn't, the important thing to note is
[03:49:18.556 --> 03:49:20.737]  That liner where they say you are the resistance.
[03:49:20.817 --> 03:49:24.379]  It's important for you to understand and appreciate the power that you have.
[03:49:25.080 --> 03:49:27.461]  And I'll tell you this quick little story about Facebook today.
[03:49:27.481 --> 03:49:31.043]  There was a Facebook event here in Chicagoland and I went to it.
[03:49:31.063 --> 03:49:32.023]  It was a business event.
[03:49:32.544 --> 03:49:37.707]  And I did one for the media a few months ago to see what they would tell us about how Facebook works.
[03:49:38.327 --> 03:49:42.749]  And today I went to this event because it was supposed to be how Facebook works for business.
[03:49:43.510 --> 03:49:44.971]  They spent the first 15 minutes
[03:49:46.073 --> 03:49:54.776]  At the Facebook business event, where there was about 250 people, mostly women, probably about 60-70% female and about 40% male.
[03:49:55.476 --> 03:49:59.477]  And in this room, Facebook, like the people from Facebook corporate, were there.
[03:49:59.537 --> 03:50:00.177]  They were set up.
[03:50:01.097 --> 03:50:07.259]  And the first thing they did was, they gave the floor to three local politicians.
[03:50:07.839 --> 03:50:09.560]  Elected officials, not just politicians.
[03:50:09.960 --> 03:50:12.801]  Two state reps and one state senator from Illinois.
[03:50:14.036 --> 03:50:17.717]  Now, they gave them all equal time, except one didn't show up.
[03:50:19.677 --> 03:50:24.799]  And they were all Democratic representatives.
[03:50:25.739 --> 03:50:27.319]  There was not one Republican.
[03:50:27.639 --> 03:50:29.700]  There was not one Tea Party.
[03:50:29.960 --> 03:50:31.700]  There was not one Libertarian.
[03:50:31.740 --> 03:50:32.741]  They were all Democrats.
[03:50:34.221 --> 03:50:34.381]  Now,
[03:50:35.311 --> 03:50:37.933]  I'm no power of influence guy.
[03:50:37.973 --> 03:50:40.955]  I'm no hypnotist like Scott Adams, although I do follow him on Twitter.
[03:50:40.995 --> 03:50:43.756]  He's very interesting and I like what he does.
[03:50:43.796 --> 03:50:45.437]  I like watching his periscopes and stuff.
[03:50:45.738 --> 03:50:47.799]  I loved having him on Alex Jones.
[03:50:47.819 --> 03:50:54.003]  It was like one of those worlds collide moments where it's like, yes, I want to hear Alex talk to Scott Adams and I want to hear Scott talk to Alex.
[03:50:54.083 --> 03:50:54.563]  It was great.
[03:50:55.283 --> 03:51:00.667]  But the persuasion, the embedded persuasion, even I know this, at the Facebook meeting is,
[03:51:01.497 --> 03:51:03.678]  All three representatives were Democrats.
[03:51:03.858 --> 03:51:05.619]  Your representatives are Democrats.
[03:51:07.540 --> 03:51:15.703]  The embedded persuasion when a gun event happens is the right argues for guns, the left argues against guns.
[03:51:16.784 --> 03:51:26.148]  Very few people have the libertarian flag on where they're like, hey, the government should stay out of it and we should follow the Constitution and let's just stick with that.
[03:51:27.150 --> 03:51:28.110]  But that doesn't happen.
[03:51:29.110 --> 03:51:31.631]  We fire up that left-right paradigm thing again.
[03:51:32.511 --> 03:51:34.792]  And it's a manipulation of you.
[03:51:35.572 --> 03:51:43.894]  And when I watch and I listen to people, for instance, when I first discovered Alex Jones, first thing I did was I flew to Austin, Texas, and I wanted to meet the guy.
[03:51:44.614 --> 03:51:45.634]  What is this guy about?
[03:51:45.794 --> 03:51:46.874]  Where's his heart?
[03:51:47.655 --> 03:51:48.195]  Where's his head?
[03:51:48.235 --> 03:51:48.835]  Where's his heart?
[03:51:49.095 --> 03:51:49.615]  What's he like?
[03:51:50.399 --> 03:51:51.379]  Went back out there again.
[03:51:51.399 --> 03:51:56.701]  And obviously, we still carry the show and things have grown from there.
[03:51:56.761 --> 03:51:57.802]  I think he's a good man.
[03:51:57.842 --> 03:51:59.002]  I think he's got a good heart.
[03:51:59.322 --> 03:52:01.863]  I think he does this because he actually cares.
[03:52:01.963 --> 03:52:02.904]  Yeah, he makes a living.
[03:52:02.924 --> 03:52:04.104]  Yeah, they have to sell supplements.
[03:52:04.364 --> 03:52:05.385]  That keeps it all going.
[03:52:05.425 --> 03:52:06.765]  He's a job creator.
[03:52:07.025 --> 03:52:08.346]  He's a job provider.
[03:52:08.826 --> 03:52:10.607]  He's an amazing dude, this guy.
[03:52:12.047 --> 03:52:16.629]  He does it because he loves and cares about you, I believe.
[03:52:17.443 --> 03:52:22.025]  And I ask myself that same question about, like, the Anderson Coopers of the world and the Donna Brazils of the world.
[03:52:22.805 --> 03:52:26.666]  Donna Brazil is out there saying, my book is dedicated to Seth Rich.
[03:52:27.246 --> 03:52:28.527]  Hillary bad!
[03:52:29.547 --> 03:52:31.748]  And before, she was like, eh, Hillary's alright.
[03:52:32.948 --> 03:52:33.709]  Well, what happened?
[03:52:34.029 --> 03:52:34.729]  What changed?
[03:52:35.501 --> 03:52:37.763]  She was afraid for her life before, and now she's come out.
[03:52:38.003 --> 03:52:43.288]  Well, number one, the more popular, the more famous she gets, the more protected she is.
[03:52:43.689 --> 03:52:46.451]  She's almost to the point of almost untouchable.
[03:52:46.492 --> 03:52:50.255]  She's not going to experience an involuntary suicide, hopefully.
[03:52:50.695 --> 03:52:50.876]  Right?
[03:52:51.416 --> 03:52:52.037]  So that's good.
[03:52:52.637 --> 03:52:54.559]  Scott Adams has done that for himself also.
[03:52:55.340 --> 03:52:58.483]  They're almost to the point of enough people know, so they're kind of untouchable.
[03:52:58.503 --> 03:53:00.044]  But she dedicates this book to Seth Rich.
[03:53:00.164 --> 03:53:00.505]  Why?
[03:53:02.074 --> 03:53:18.385]  To influence people like us, people that may be more libertarian, people that may be more conservative, people that may be more level-headed about certain issues and may have been in touch with the Seth Rich issue, to persuade you to go, Donna Brazile's not so bad.
[03:53:19.566 --> 03:53:21.768]  Donna Brazile wants to sell books.
[03:53:22.028 --> 03:53:24.149]  That's why she wants to persuade you to like her.
[03:53:24.730 --> 03:53:27.752]  Number one, Donna Brazile
[03:53:28.624 --> 03:53:32.086]  wants to, I'm sure, be elected to something after this.
[03:53:32.166 --> 03:53:34.848]  Because at some point, Donna's going to have to make some money.
[03:53:35.969 --> 03:53:37.269]  After this book, what's she going to do?
[03:53:37.630 --> 03:53:39.551]  So thing number one is she's got to sell books.
[03:53:40.651 --> 03:53:49.857]  It isn't like Brain Force where the team at InfoWars went, wait a minute, we're losing advertisers because they're threatening us and Media Matters is coming after us.
[03:53:49.917 --> 03:53:53.239]  Well, we got to sell our own stuff so that we can pay for all this.
[03:53:53.799 --> 03:53:54.700]  It's the reverse.
[03:53:55.447 --> 03:53:58.409]  Donna went, okay, I gotta sell books.
[03:53:58.769 --> 03:54:01.691]  My publisher, Hatchet Books, wants me to sell books.
[03:54:02.892 --> 03:54:03.993]  They know how to sell books.
[03:54:04.593 --> 03:54:08.196]  They probably sat her down with a PR expert and said, alright, well here's how you're gonna do it.
[03:54:08.416 --> 03:54:09.076]  Here's what you're gonna do.
[03:54:09.096 --> 03:54:10.277]  We're gonna get you in all this media.
[03:54:10.858 --> 03:54:12.939]  And now both the left and the right are covering it.
[03:54:13.479 --> 03:54:16.441]  The left is covering it because they're gonna defend Hillary.
[03:54:16.481 --> 03:54:19.123]  They're gonna defend against what Donna's saying.
[03:54:19.403 --> 03:54:22.806]  So now she's the bad girl for the Democrats.
[03:54:23.519 --> 03:54:25.180]  She's on the outs, but not really.
[03:54:25.220 --> 03:54:28.341]  But she's a maverick in the Liberal Democratic Party.
[03:54:29.822 --> 03:54:32.884]  She's pacing and leading, I think, as Scott Adams would say, in a way.
[03:54:33.444 --> 03:54:35.165]  Again, I'm no persuasion expert.
[03:54:37.306 --> 03:54:47.410]  Now, the Republicans and the Libertarians are looking at Donna Brazile and they're going, and, you know, Kim Dotcom is going, yeah, Donna's with us on the Seth Rich thing.
[03:54:47.891 --> 03:54:48.311]  All right.
[03:54:50.372 --> 03:54:52.673]  So now she's building a following.
[03:54:53.570 --> 03:54:56.092]  That's what everybody's got to do in this day and age.
[03:54:56.412 --> 03:54:57.233]  That's what they're all doing.
[03:54:57.273 --> 03:55:00.095]  That's what they're using the Twitter for and the Facebook for.
[03:55:00.575 --> 03:55:01.516]  In the internet ghettos.
[03:55:01.956 --> 03:55:03.157]  They're all trying to build a following.
[03:55:03.177 --> 03:55:07.240]  And that's why Comey changed his name on Twitter today.
[03:55:08.040 --> 03:55:09.101]  He's now at Comey.
[03:55:11.042 --> 03:55:11.343]  Why?
[03:55:11.363 --> 03:55:14.205]  Because, man, he's going to sell books later.
[03:55:14.345 --> 03:55:20.509]  He's going to sell... He's probably going to be with Brian Williams talking about how they were in Vietnam together.
[03:55:20.989 --> 03:55:22.931]  Storing the beaches in Normandy before that.
[03:55:24.187 --> 03:55:26.929]  And then, you know, there'll be pictures of them in the Old West.
[03:55:27.589 --> 03:55:28.750]  Like, back to the future.
[03:55:28.770 --> 03:55:30.011]  Be like, remember when we did that?
[03:55:30.071 --> 03:55:31.111]  Yeah, that was good.
[03:55:31.612 --> 03:55:32.752]  That's what Comey's gotta do now.
[03:55:32.792 --> 03:55:34.674]  He's gotta build a following and sell stuff.
[03:55:35.574 --> 03:55:36.395]  That's his way.
[03:55:36.735 --> 03:55:37.716]  That's what Donna's doing.
[03:55:38.696 --> 03:55:39.897]  Maybe she's not all bad.
[03:55:40.888 --> 03:55:41.868]  But that's what happens.
[03:55:41.908 --> 03:55:45.790]  That's why there's that thing about, you know, not having false idols.
[03:55:45.810 --> 03:55:51.252]  Because you build people up too much and you go like, oh yeah, she's dedicating the book to Seth Rich.
[03:55:51.272 --> 03:55:52.352]  Well, why is she doing that?
[03:55:52.752 --> 03:56:00.335]  Because she knows there's a bunch of people out there that have been truth seekers that are going, why aren't you talking about Seth Rich news?
[03:56:00.375 --> 03:56:01.476]  Why aren't you talking about Seth Rich?
[03:56:01.516 --> 03:56:03.356]  Why did Hannity stop talking about Seth Rich?
[03:56:03.636 --> 03:56:04.757]  What about Seth Rich?
[03:56:05.817 --> 03:56:07.578]  Now it's being talked about, which is great.
[03:56:08.527 --> 03:56:11.288]  Except they're kind of talking about Donna Brazile more.
[03:56:13.348 --> 03:56:15.869]  Just like we're talking about guns more.
[03:56:16.329 --> 03:56:25.231]  And isn't it convenient how the conversation again today is going to be about whether or not we should have guns or not.
[03:56:25.691 --> 03:56:26.951]  Whether or not that should be legal.
[03:56:27.251 --> 03:56:28.992]  Whether or not there should be background checks.
[03:56:29.032 --> 03:56:30.172]  Whether or not there's loopholes.
[03:56:31.061 --> 03:56:40.168]  Like this concept of stopping good, law-abiding citizens from having guns so that the bad guys who are always going to break the law are always going to be armed and then you're going to be helpless.
[03:56:41.169 --> 03:56:45.011]  And your police are going to be paralyzed because they don't want to be sued by the family.
[03:56:45.292 --> 03:56:47.894]  They're not going to rush to protect.
[03:56:49.135 --> 03:56:53.658]  Not because they don't want to, not because they're not good people, but they have families too.
[03:56:55.019 --> 03:56:57.221]  But that's what everyone's going to be talking about now.
[03:56:57.781 --> 03:56:59.042]  The conversation will be about guns.
[03:56:59.062 --> 03:57:00.323]  It won't be about Seth Rich so much.
[03:57:00.959 --> 03:57:04.260]  Donna Brazile is gonna do the media rounds, and guess what?
[03:57:04.420 --> 03:57:16.024]  Since she's been coached up by her PR firm, since she's been coached up by the publisher, she's gonna be on CNN, she's gonna be on MSNBC, she'll be on Fox, she'll be all over!
[03:57:16.064 --> 03:57:17.104]  She'll be on both sides!
[03:57:18.524 --> 03:57:22.265]  When's the last time you saw, like, Alex Jones on both sides of the media?
[03:57:23.486 --> 03:57:24.186]  Doesn't happen.
[03:57:25.407 --> 03:57:26.849]  Matt Dubiel from Chicago.
[03:57:26.889 --> 03:57:31.916]  It's always a pleasure to sit in for fourth hour at the Great Info Wars for Alex Jones.

[03:57:44.944 --> 03:57:46.945]  It's up to us to watch out for each other.
[03:57:47.305 --> 03:57:51.066]  We're all in this together, liberals and democrats, conservatives and libertarians.
[03:57:51.646 --> 03:57:52.126]  Everybody.
[03:57:52.547 --> 03:57:53.947]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:57:54.207 --> 03:57:55.528]  You can't survive without it.
[03:57:55.688 --> 03:57:56.608]  But where do you get it?

[03:58:02.890 --> 03:58:08.632]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:58:08.792 --> 03:58:25.659]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:58:26.039 --> 03:58:28.180]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
