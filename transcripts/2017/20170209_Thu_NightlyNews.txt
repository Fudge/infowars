[00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:19.547]  Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:21.388]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.389]  I'm Darren McBreen.
[00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:27.513]  It is Thursday, February 9th, 2017, and here's a quick look at what's coming up.
[00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:34.138]  Tonight, what is the greatest threat to America?
[00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:35.098]  Cyber attacks?
[00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:36.499]  Stock market crash?
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.261]  Or the progressive liberal agenda?
[00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:40.246]  I'm good.
[00:00:55.163 --> 00:00:58.367]  Polls indicate it is themselves that is not trusted.
[00:00:58.907 --> 00:01:02.491]  Meanwhile, Jeff Sessions is sworn in as Attorney General.
[00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:10.680]  Despite everything the left tried, protests, false narratives, speaking against him on the floor, Sessions is the new AG.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.564]  All that and more tonight on the InfoLores Nightly News.
[00:01:30.347 --> 00:01:36.952]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:44.718]  We're making freedom go viral, and now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:01.263 --> 00:03:13.028]  This is an island that, at its widest level, is what, 12 miles from shore to shore?
[00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:29.094]  And at its smallest level, or smallest location, it's 7 miles between one shore and the other.
[00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:31.085]  Is that correct?
[00:03:31.706 --> 00:03:37.648]  I don't have the exact dimensions, but to your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island.
[00:03:37.688 --> 00:03:50.594]  My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.
[00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.771]  I stand here as a freed slave.
[00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:09.135]  We've seen nothing that I can work with President Bush on and I'm disappointed because I thought that there might be some interest
[00:04:09.591 --> 00:04:11.492]  Because of what he said in the campaign.
[00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:13.233]  What are we going to do?
[00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:32.125]  How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims, or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin, and knowing that they have hacked our
[00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:48.973]  DCCC and DNC and knowing that he is responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families in... What is Aleppo?
[00:04:49.173 --> 00:04:49.953]  Yeah, in Aleppo.
[00:04:50.113 --> 00:04:51.494]  You are correct.
[00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:09.735]  The fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea.
[00:05:19.158 --> 00:05:22.881]  What are the biggest problems facing the United States right now?
[00:05:23.161 --> 00:05:27.944]  Or, more specific, what do you think is our biggest security threat?
[00:05:28.304 --> 00:05:30.606]  The most dangerous threat to America?
[00:05:31.046 --> 00:05:32.447]  Is it the stock market?
[00:05:32.907 --> 00:05:37.070]  A lot of people think we might see a financial collapse in our near future.
[00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.452]  Or perhaps you think it might be a cyber attack.
[00:05:40.692 --> 00:05:42.554]  Or a false flag terror attack.
[00:05:42.994 --> 00:05:43.975]  Or nuclear war.
[00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:45.536]  A global pandemic.
[00:05:45.976 --> 00:05:51.039]  Radical Muslim extremists entering the country, ISIS, Al Qaeda, a war with Iran.
[00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:53.480]  What is the biggest threat to the nation?
[00:05:53.961 --> 00:06:02.386]  Well, I am here to tell you that in my humble opinion, I think the biggest threat we face in America right now
[00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:05.967]  Is the Progressive Liberal Movement.
[00:06:06.727 --> 00:06:08.367]  I'm not kidding, I'm being dead serious.
[00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:18.830]  The Liberal Democrats in government, in the media, in academia, plus all of their snowflake followers and social justice warriors across the country.
[00:06:19.271 --> 00:06:26.193]  They have made it perfectly clear that they are at war with anyone and everyone who disagrees with them.
[00:06:26.593 --> 00:06:31.034]  And they are willing to start a civil war if they don't get their way.
[00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:41.778]  And I've always said that liberalism is a mental disorder, and unfortunately, the disease is rapidly spreading throughout large parts of the country.
[00:06:42.178 --> 00:06:46.700]  Owen Schroyer and InfoWars contributor Kevin Martin in studio with me right now.
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.740]  What do you guys think?
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.000]  Am I overreacting?
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.881]  Are the leftists, are they that crazy?
[00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:52.542]  Do you think they're that dangerous to America?
[00:06:52.602 --> 00:06:53.362]  Owen, let's start with you.
[00:06:53.442 --> 00:06:54.222]  Well, I don't know.
[00:06:54.302 --> 00:06:57.563]  I think you'll get differing opinions on what is the most dangerous.
[00:06:57.623 --> 00:07:04.565]  But we can look at policies of liberals right now that are a direct threat to our national security and to you.
[00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:08.626]  I mean, look at what's happened in Europe is a broad example.
[00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:17.849]  But let's look at Sweden here, where we just had a alleged gang rape broadcast on Facebook Live by three asylum seekers.
[00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:20.270]  Now you've got this story out of Sweden.
[00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:30.937]  In 2015, this school was awarded a Peace Prize because it took in all of these refugees, it took in all of these migrants, it had open doors for all these people.
[00:07:31.518 --> 00:07:42.345]  Now, just a year later, they have increased security, barbed wire around this school, and they had to shut down, an emergency shutdown because the school got so violent.
[00:07:42.685 --> 00:07:49.070]  So that's how the policies of the liberals can infiltrate this country and be a threat to our national security.
[00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:56.033]  The radical left policies in Sweden and the globalist policies of the left, they have fundamentally changed Sweden as we know it.
[00:07:56.233 --> 00:07:57.894]  I mean, it is a totally different country right now.
[00:07:57.914 --> 00:07:58.654]  It's really sad what's happening.
[00:07:58.694 --> 00:08:05.217]  And I've got another headline here, and this was Trump Is Right Migrant Crisis Under-Reported by the Mainstream Media.
[00:08:05.597 --> 00:08:14.401]  A Swedish court sentenced a Muslim migrant to only two months in jail after being convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl.
[00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:18.343]  Now, their defense was the kid is only 17 years old, right?
[00:08:18.703 --> 00:08:21.225]  I mean, so he only gets two months because he raped her.
[00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:26.849]  He locked the bathroom door, raped her, and you know that they don't even know for sure that he's really 17.
[00:08:26.929 --> 00:08:29.632]  He had no documentation to prove it.
[00:08:29.712 --> 00:08:47.966]  So, I mean, and this is the thing, folks, is the Democrats and the radical left, they want open borders, and as you know, they're dead set against the Trump travel ban, and they want to turn America, and America will end up being like the Muslim ghettos that we see in Europe.
[00:08:48.146 --> 00:08:51.487]  And Kevin, you know as well as I do, there's no arguing with these people.
[00:08:51.507 --> 00:08:55.948]  Because you were out there, you were out there at the protest during the inauguration and then the Women's March.
[00:08:56.308 --> 00:08:59.709]  What was it like trying to talk sense into radical leftists?
[00:09:00.349 --> 00:09:04.710]  Well, you know Darren, I, you know, I mean it's very, very, it's very, very prevalent.
[00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.611]  I mean, what you see with the left here is that there's no rationing with them.
[00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:09.651]  There's no talking to them.
[00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:10.951]  And it just doesn't matter.
[00:09:10.971 --> 00:09:14.792]  I mean, they call it the, you know, the tolerant left, but they're not tolerant.
[00:09:14.912 --> 00:09:15.832]  How did they treat you?
[00:09:16.012 --> 00:09:18.413]  I mean, they treated me as if I was an outcast.
[00:09:18.513 --> 00:09:19.233]  I mean, here I am.
[00:09:19.273 --> 00:09:20.393]  I'm an African-American.
[00:09:20.753 --> 00:09:21.853]  You know, I'm conservative.
[00:09:21.893 --> 00:09:25.334]  And you would think that I would fit their narrative, right?
[00:09:25.354 --> 00:09:28.934]  I mean, it's all about civil rights and, you know, equal opportunity for African-Americans.
[00:09:29.575 --> 00:09:35.816]  But I don't fit that narrative to the left because I don't believe and I don't think and I don't talk and I don't walk the way they do.
[00:09:35.956 --> 00:09:36.816]  So I'm not accepted.
[00:09:36.996 --> 00:09:39.456]  And I'm in fear for my life.
[00:09:39.536 --> 00:09:42.597]  I can't wear anything that has anything to do with any conservatism.
[00:09:43.746 --> 00:09:45.047]  Nothing to do with Donald Trump.
[00:09:46.748 --> 00:09:49.329]  Anything to do with that, and I'm in fear for my life.
[00:09:49.369 --> 00:09:50.350]  And there's no debate.
[00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:51.790]  All they have is name calling.
[00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:58.174]  We've had women that showed up at the Women's March with Make America Great Again hats, and they were like demons from hell.
[00:09:58.214 --> 00:09:58.894]  That's the way they were treated.
[00:09:58.914 --> 00:10:00.475]  Yeah, there's a lot of them that were getting beat up there.
[00:10:00.755 --> 00:10:01.175]  A lot of them.
[00:10:01.415 --> 00:10:02.616]  And you've experienced the same thing.
[00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:10.661]  Well, and again, if we try to inject just conversation, whether we agree or disagree, you say, hey, you want these open border policies.
[00:10:11.002 --> 00:10:15.325]  We've got a Houston mayor saying, mi casa es su casa on sanctuary cities.
[00:10:15.905 --> 00:10:18.747]  You've got, in Dallas, they're trying to do sanctuary cities.
[00:10:19.267 --> 00:10:31.896]  Research from the Pew Research Center, and this is really telling, it shows the 20 major metropolitan areas with the largest number of unauthorized immigrants, which, by the way, this is how they also rigged the vote, by loading the inner cities
[00:10:32.276 --> 00:10:35.278]  With blue voters so that they can steal the Electoral College.
[00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:38.141]  But it's the policies, Darren.
[00:10:38.181 --> 00:10:42.825]  You cannot say, here is the, you know, response.
[00:10:42.865 --> 00:10:44.426]  This is what's going to happen with your policies.
[00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:49.150]  The school is barbed wire, needs security 24-7 now because of their open-door policy.
[00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:53.373]  That's what you're going to get in your sanctuary cities after 10, 20, 30 years.
[00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:54.634]  It's just like what happened in Europe.
[00:10:54.874 --> 00:10:57.096]  But they won't have that conversation, and that's what you're alluding to.
[00:10:57.116 --> 00:10:59.518]  Well, I think a lot of people, they don't know what's happening in Europe.
[00:10:59.538 --> 00:11:00.639]  A lot of Americans don't.
[00:11:00.859 --> 00:11:05.704]  And a lot of Europeans do, because they're like, oh, I wish we never would have allowed this s*** to happen, right?
[00:11:05.724 --> 00:11:14.874]  Because it is a tsunami of refugees that are out there, and they're not like, they fundamentally changed, they don't think like the Western culture.
[00:11:14.914 --> 00:11:18.778]  They're a totally different culture, they don't fit in, and it's a mess.
[00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:23.440]  Well, I think the threat is potentially a civil war.
[00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.761]  I mean, if they keep protesting like this, eventually what's going to have to happen?
[00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:34.703]  You're either going to have to have martial law, or they're just going to keep getting more violent, they're creating their little fight clubs, and it's going to have to be a fight!
[00:11:34.743 --> 00:11:37.204]  I mean, something's going to have to be done about these people if they keep getting violent.
[00:11:37.224 --> 00:11:37.944]  But here's the thing, too.
[00:11:38.624 --> 00:11:41.086]  I mean, Darren, these are self-destructive people.
[00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:41.886]  Okay?
[00:11:42.246 --> 00:11:43.767]  We don't even necessarily have to do anything.
[00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:44.708]  They're just going to self-destruct.
[00:11:44.728 --> 00:11:45.488]  Look at Kellogg's.
[00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:47.570]  They're laying off a ton of people.
[00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.992]  Of course, they get boycotted after the political stances that they took.
[00:11:51.392 --> 00:11:57.656]  Now Netflix, they come out, they've got this Dear White People show that they're trying to publicize now.
[00:11:57.976 --> 00:12:01.979]  Now they're losing subscribers because of the politics that they're engaging in.
[00:12:02.259 --> 00:12:05.061]  This is a self-destructive thing right now in America.
[00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:07.903]  And again, I don't know if it's the biggest threat, but
[00:12:08.343 --> 00:12:11.365]  It's a threat to themselves, it's a threat to this country, their policies are at least.
[00:12:11.385 --> 00:12:16.768]  Well and here real quick I just want to point out that this is not a grassroots leftist movement.
[00:12:16.868 --> 00:12:20.050]  I mean this comes from the global elitist at the very top.
[00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:26.114]  Guys like George Soros and the global elitist throughout the world and the establishment media and they're very powerful.
[00:12:26.414 --> 00:12:30.857]  Another thing, an entity that's very powerful is Hollywood.
[00:12:31.337 --> 00:12:36.000]  And they have the power of influence, and you got, you know, movie stars that are out there.
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:43.885]  Who's the actress that was saying, Sarah Silverman, that says that we need a military overthrow of the United States government?
[00:12:44.145 --> 00:12:50.249]  Madonna was out there saying that she wishes, that she's thought several times about blowing up the White House.
[00:12:50.349 --> 00:13:00.056]  And it's sad, because what people need to realize is that when Muslims, with this travel ban and immigrants are flooded here,
[00:13:00.916 --> 00:13:04.641]  They're coming here because they're escaping terror, am I right?
[00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:15.994]  I mean, they're escaping terror and they're coming here as a safe haven and the reason why we are a safe haven is because we protect our borders and we're not an Islamic state!
[00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:24.721]  Why would you come here escaping something and you won't let us protect ourselves from the very thing that you're escaping from?
[00:13:24.741 --> 00:13:25.562]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:13:25.602 --> 00:13:29.545]  The environment that they're going to create is the environment that they're trying to escape from.
[00:13:29.785 --> 00:13:30.666]  It makes no sense.
[00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:31.587]  And here's another thing.
[00:13:31.647 --> 00:13:41.395]  We know from President Donald Trump plus intelligence sources all across the board who are unified in their agreement that the Trojan horse
[00:13:41.895 --> 00:13:46.819]  That ISIS will disguise themselves as a Syrian refugee or a Muslim refugee.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.162]  That's how they're going to enter the country.
[00:13:50.302 --> 00:13:52.784]  These are stories that are five years old.
[00:13:52.804 --> 00:13:54.165]  I mean, that's not new news.
[00:13:54.225 --> 00:13:56.027]  That's been reported for years now.
[00:13:56.087 --> 00:13:59.510]  In fact, there was an arrest, you know, the whole Bowling Green massacre.
[00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.311]  There was actually some truth to that.
[00:14:01.331 --> 00:14:05.255]  There was an arrest of refugees who snuck in and they were going to commit acts of terror.
[00:14:05.695 --> 00:14:06.215]  That's right.
[00:14:06.276 --> 00:14:10.018]  So the liberals' main agenda right now is to divide the country.
[00:14:10.078 --> 00:14:13.040]  Divide and conquer and establish order out of chaos.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.064]  And if you don't agree with the liberal agenda, well that might make you a racist.
[00:14:30.097 --> 00:14:31.958]  It's in your television shows.
[00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:33.278]  Let's start with Cracker.
[00:14:33.618 --> 00:14:47.362]  While linguistic history is always murky, recent research has shown that in the 16 and 1700s, British aristocrats used Cracker as a shortened version of cracked brains, or idle-headed, to disparage lower-class people as dumb and lazy.
[00:14:47.542 --> 00:14:48.542]  It's on the news.
[00:14:48.862 --> 00:14:52.463]  What do you say to the people who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?
[00:14:52.543 --> 00:14:55.064]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please, stop.
[00:14:55.404 --> 00:14:55.944]  Stop it, Carl.
[00:14:56.124 --> 00:14:58.026]  And it's glorified in Hollywood.
[00:14:58.307 --> 00:15:02.152]  Here comes yet another token black presenter.
[00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:14.371]  It is the cognitive dissonance feeding weapon of reverse racism.
[00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:37.516]  That is, rather than agreeing on and fighting for equality across the board, reverse racism is described as acts of discrimination and prejudice perpetrated by racial minorities or historically oppressed ethnical groups against individuals belonging to the racial majority or historically dominant ethnical groups.
[00:15:37.896 --> 00:15:47.038]  In other words, it is reverse discrimination based on racial criteria at the heart of division in the United States of America.
[00:15:47.458 --> 00:15:53.740]  Mediocre Negroes being dragged in front of TV as a photo op for Donald Trump's exploitative campaign against black people.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.260]  And you are a prime example of that, sir.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.761]  So now you want a name call, Mark.
[00:15:57.781 --> 00:15:59.521]  Smart, you better jump in.
[00:15:59.561 --> 00:16:01.982]  Now you want a name call?
[00:16:02.002 --> 00:16:06.843]  Then, you know, if you don't want to support the alt-right, don't choose as a White House counselor.
[00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:16.072]  Counselor, a man who uses the word ****, whose wife says that he did not want his daughters to go to a school with too many Jews.
[00:16:16.713 --> 00:16:27.504]  And don't choose, as an attorney general, a man who calls the NAACP an un-American organization, and who we learned in The Guardian today, went so far as to prosecute... Charles, just hang on a second.
[00:16:27.584 --> 00:16:29.146]  I appreciate you going through all of this.
[00:16:29.793 --> 00:16:32.994]  But please don't use the n-word on my show.
[00:16:33.014 --> 00:16:42.656]  I'm sorry, well I never use the n-word except when I'm quoting someone who's been appointed by the president to serve in the Oval Office since this is such a disgusting moment in our history.
[00:16:42.996 --> 00:16:55.198]  And its use by the liberal hard left is utilized as a static bulwark against the rational progress needed to move a democratic melting pot culture forward.
[00:16:55.558 --> 00:17:04.846]  Mikhail Thelin of InfoWars reports, the terms microaggression and safe space were added this week to the Merriam-Webster dictionary.
[00:17:04.986 --> 00:17:14.194]  The terms associated with modern progressives have caused a backlash by both conservatives, classical liberals, and some in academia.
[00:17:14.674 --> 00:17:24.183]  In an article entitled, The Coddling of the American Mind, writers for The Atlantic argue that the phenomenon is disastrous for education and mental health.
[00:17:24.524 --> 00:17:27.427]  John Rappaport echoes that sentiment when he writes,
[00:17:29.949 --> 00:17:42.657]  From the National Alliance on Mental Illness, more than 25% of college students have been diagnosed or treated by a professional for a mental health condition within the past year.
[00:17:42.917 --> 00:17:48.680]  You want to know where all this victim-oriented, I'm triggered and I need a safe space comes from?
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.901]  You just found it.
[00:17:50.021 --> 00:17:56.925]  The millennial generation, or Generation Y, has embraced a revolution of reverse racism
[00:17:57.165 --> 00:17:57.345]  That's
[00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:15.802]  We're good to go.
[00:18:30.032 --> 00:18:45.793]  As the millennial generation splinters off into adulthood and reason takes a minimal hold, a far more individualistic and technologically savvy generation will be criticizing your leftist tunnel vision in no time.
[00:18:46.053 --> 00:18:47.415]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:19:01.397 --> 00:19:05.802]  This has been adopted as of 2017 by the Department of Defense.
[00:19:06.383 --> 00:19:07.805]  All four branches of the military.
[00:19:08.506 --> 00:19:09.347]  Combat One.
[00:19:10.408 --> 00:19:20.540]  And guess who in the spring of 2017 has the exclusive right to sell this to everybody else but the military?
[00:19:21.454 --> 00:19:22.994]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:23.614 --> 00:19:27.195]  I want to commend Q and Patrick and the rest of our team.
[00:19:27.235 --> 00:19:30.496]  I want to commend Combat One for getting the big Pentagon deal.
[00:19:31.096 --> 00:19:33.857]  And I want to thank them for supporting us because they know we support America.
[00:19:34.177 --> 00:19:47.719]  We are the exclusive source of Combat One Skin and Muscle Optimization Field Foam, Field Spray Skin and Muscle Optimization, and Broad Spectrum Hygiene Tactical Bath.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.980]  Contains eight pre-moistened cloths.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:56.324]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are incredibly affordable and they have patented proprietary systems.
[00:19:56.925 --> 00:20:01.988]  That's why it's been adopted by the Pentagon, by the Defense Department, system-wide.
[00:20:02.048 --> 00:20:08.954]  I'm going to go over some of the numbers, some of the proven statistics and the claims that Combat One can make right now.
[00:20:09.754 --> 00:20:18.803]  Never before has the public been able to access this new Combat One military-grade hygiene technology used by special operations to maintain hygiene during survival situations.
[00:20:19.183 --> 00:20:21.265]  Studied for safety and effectiveness by St.
[00:20:21.325 --> 00:20:23.387]  John's Medical Research Institute, St.
[00:20:23.447 --> 00:20:31.195]  Jude's, and the American Journal of Infection Control, the technology behind Combat One wipes kills bad bacteria while leaving beneficial
[00:20:31.915 --> 00:20:33.396]  Skin bacteria unharmed.
[00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:34.557]  That's the key buffer.
[00:20:34.777 --> 00:20:39.500]  The toxic wipes, the sanitizers kill everything, including your immune system.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.460]  They lower your fertility.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.021]  It's all admitted.
[00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:44.883]  Combat One is able to do this naturally by only targeting the bad stuff.
[00:20:45.363 --> 00:20:46.264]  And again, it's all patented.
[00:20:46.304 --> 00:20:47.064]  It's super secret.
[00:20:47.424 --> 00:20:49.326]  Twelve years, Special Forces testing it.
[00:20:49.966 --> 00:20:55.352]  This is something every M4 Warrior needs to order, needs to have in their home, needs to use in their daily lives.
[00:20:55.652 --> 00:21:01.078]  Whether it's cleaning your guns, or your own skin, or when you're out camping, this is the game changer.
[00:21:01.098 --> 00:21:06.224]  The entire family of Combat One is available exclusively at m4warriorstore.com.
[00:21:07.202 --> 00:21:10.545]  Just coming back from the river where I was using one of our water filtration straws.
[00:21:11.105 --> 00:21:13.427]  A certain device we sell here at Infantwarestore.com.
[00:21:14.188 --> 00:21:18.591]  And I had smacked my knuckle pretty hard the other day with my knife after cleaning one of the animals.
[00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:21.673]  So I'm going to use some Combat One Foam.
[00:21:22.034 --> 00:21:23.335]  Show you guys that we actually use it.
[00:21:23.775 --> 00:21:24.536]  How well it works.
[00:21:25.556 --> 00:21:27.698]  This wound has been open for about five days now.
[00:21:28.459 --> 00:21:30.000]  I just dipped it in and out of the river.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.362]  So just to better, safe than sorry.
[00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:45.189]  Once I let that soak in, I'll wrap it up, field dress, and nice and clean again.
[00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.775]  And it certainly is coming to the rescue with Combat One.
[00:21:49.135 --> 00:21:50.257]  Born in America.
[00:21:50.718 --> 00:21:51.619]  Made in America.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.466]  And now distributed by InfoWars to America.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.401]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-gmo organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.534]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.834 --> 00:23:00.764]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:07.973]  Kevin Martin, coming to you from InfoWars.
[00:23:08.674 --> 00:23:21.507]  We just received news, as of about 6 o'clock last night, that Senator Jeff Sessions, now Attorney General of the United States in the Trump administration, Trump pick for Attorney General of the United States, is confirmed.
[00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:31.717]  A lot of people will say, isn't Jeff Sessions that racist, homophobe, senator from Alabama?
[00:23:32.097 --> 00:23:44.066]  Well, some people would say that, but some people would also say that Jeff Sessions is one of the most prominent figures in the fight against discrimination of African Americans, as well as the fight for equality.
[00:23:45.731 --> 00:23:50.752]  What I'd kind of like to talk about here briefly is, I just want to take you to this picture.
[00:23:50.792 --> 00:24:09.197]  Now, here is a picture, okay, of African-American civil rights leaders and pastors that are actually meeting in Washington, D.C., okay, in rally and in support of Senator Jeff Sessions, now Attorney General Sessions, of the United States, okay?
[00:24:11.038 --> 00:24:11.799]  Here's an article.
[00:24:12.259 --> 00:24:17.145]  This is what Sessions' role in prosecuting the Klan reveals about his civil rights record.
[00:24:17.686 --> 00:24:25.875]  Defenders of Trump's choice for Attorney General have cited an Alabama lynching case as evidence of his commitment to racial equality.
[00:24:26.655 --> 00:24:27.855]  35 years ago, the U.S.
[00:24:27.915 --> 00:24:40.179]  Attorney's Office in the Southern District of Alabama played a crucial role in ensuring that the lynching of a 19-year-old Michael Donald by two members of the Klu Klux Klan was investigated and punished.
[00:24:40.659 --> 00:24:48.261]  That gruesome case has become newly relevant with the nomination of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions to run the Department of Justice.
[00:24:48.321 --> 00:24:49.621]  Sessions was the U.S.
[00:24:49.681 --> 00:24:53.182]  Attorney for the Southern District when the Donald case was tried.
[00:24:53.322 --> 00:25:01.824]  Senator Jeff Sessions sent this man to death row for lynching an African-American man that was walking home from school.
[00:25:02.424 --> 00:25:03.104]  Lynching him.
[00:25:03.404 --> 00:25:04.745]  He sent him to death row.
[00:25:04.845 --> 00:25:14.267]  Now, my question is, is if that is not a direct example of fighting for civil rights at its greatest, then what is?
[00:25:15.287 --> 00:25:25.774]  You know, we've seen with the nomination of Jeff Sessions and the hold-up with the nomination, that there was obviously a very, very divided Senate.
[00:25:26.615 --> 00:25:32.999]  The people in the Senate that were for Jeff Sessions, you could see the reason they were for him.
[00:25:33.259 --> 00:25:33.559]  They said,
[00:25:34.804 --> 00:25:44.489]  Jeff Sessions is a man of good temperament, he's a man of respect, he's a man of valor, and he's a man of acceptance, accepting everybody.
[00:25:44.569 --> 00:25:49.992]  Even though he might not agree with your rhetoric, he'll listen to what you have to say.
[00:25:50.132 --> 00:25:57.296]  Now, the people that didn't want to confirm, that couldn't cast a vote in good faith, said this.
[00:25:58.311 --> 00:26:06.456]  They said, Senator Jeff Sessions has not fought for civil rights, so we cannot put our stamp of approval on Senator Jeff Sessions.
[00:26:06.796 --> 00:26:10.499]  Now, my question is, now, I'm an African-American man, okay?
[00:26:10.539 --> 00:26:12.880]  I'm an American first, but I'm an African-American, okay?
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.181]  I'm a black man in America.
[00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:26.149]  Now, the reason I say that is because I'm an African-American man that wholeheartedly believes in the Trump administration, I believe in his picks, and I believe in Senator Jeff Sessions as the Attorney General of the United States.
[00:26:26.469 --> 00:26:27.170]  Let me tell you why.
[00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.192]  Donald Trump is very, very, very smart.
[00:26:30.493 --> 00:26:32.795]  He's not just out there picking people that are rich.
[00:26:32.875 --> 00:26:34.737]  Oh, picking people that he likes.
[00:26:35.077 --> 00:26:40.262]  He is picking people that he actually believes are going to do a good job.
[00:26:40.522 --> 00:26:41.784]  And we have proof here.
[00:26:42.204 --> 00:26:43.305]  Here is an article.
[00:26:43.765 --> 00:26:48.670]  Jeff Sessions holds hands with John Lewis across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
[00:26:49.751 --> 00:27:06.000]  In another blow to the narrative that Donald Trump and his cabinet nominees are racist, several photos emerged over the weekend showing Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions holding hands with civil rights icon Congressman John Lewis during a march in 2015.
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:12.164]  Robbie wrote, I'm sharing these photos that my staff member took in Selma during the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.
[00:27:12.944 --> 00:27:21.010]  Showing Senator Sessions joining arms with civil rights icon Representative John Lewis and other leaders to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
[00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.352]  That was an important day for Alabama.
[00:27:25.052 --> 00:27:32.418]  And Senator Sessions made it a point to be there because he knew how meaningful his presence and participation was.
[00:27:33.078 --> 00:27:50.282]  So Jeff Sessions, congratulations on your nomination for Attorney General of the United States, and God bless you, and God keep you, and God make His face to shine upon you, and be gracious unto you, and give you wisdom, and give you grace in leading this country.
[00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:54.523]  God bless you, God protect you, and God make His face to shine upon you.
[00:27:55.303 --> 00:27:55.883]  God bless.
[00:27:56.303 --> 00:27:58.884]  Kevin Martin, InfoWars.com.
[00:27:59.004 --> 00:28:00.264]  Proud to be an InfoWarrior.
[00:28:09.878 --> 00:28:17.965]  The detention of an illegal immigrant woman in Arizona outside of an ICE location in Phoenix has sparked protests.
[00:28:18.325 --> 00:28:33.257]  Now the woman was warned by activists that she was at risk of being deported for a felony conviction that she had for criminal impersonation in which she apparently used somebody's social security number to obtain employment.
[00:28:33.598 --> 00:28:36.960]  Now we all know that identity theft is not a victimless crime.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.822]  There are victims to this type of crime.
[00:28:39.142 --> 00:28:47.893]  So let's go ahead and ask some of these students here at the University of Texas in Austin if they would want an illegal immigrant that stole their identity to be deported.
[00:28:48.754 --> 00:28:52.279]  What do you guys think about Trump's immigration policies?
[00:28:52.739 --> 00:28:57.445]  Do you think that if somebody commits a crime they should be deported if they're here already illegally?
[00:28:58.708 --> 00:29:00.670]  I prefer not to comment on this.
[00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.771]  Yeah, so do I. I'm sorry.
[00:29:03.271 --> 00:29:04.232]  We prefer not to comment.
[00:29:04.412 --> 00:29:04.892]  Thank you, though.
[00:29:05.172 --> 00:29:10.516]  What do you think about... I prefer not to comment, actually.
[00:29:10.536 --> 00:29:11.396]  Is that totally fine?
[00:29:11.837 --> 00:29:12.157]  That's fine!
[00:29:12.177 --> 00:29:13.077]  Thank you.
[00:29:13.818 --> 00:29:18.061]  What do you think about Donald Trump's immigration policies?
[00:29:18.081 --> 00:29:19.441]  I don't know.
[00:29:19.582 --> 00:29:19.882]  I'm fine.
[00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:28.638]  Nobody wants to speak on this subject out of probably fear of being non-politically correct.
[00:29:28.658 --> 00:29:29.639]  I don't know.
[00:29:29.659 --> 00:29:31.983]  I'm an immigrant myself, so I don't know.
[00:29:32.003 --> 00:29:34.066]  I'm not American, so I have no say in this.
[00:29:34.646 --> 00:29:35.267]  Where are you from?
[00:29:35.287 --> 00:29:37.510]  I'm from the islands of Barbados.
[00:29:38.812 --> 00:29:39.052]  Yeah.
[00:29:39.693 --> 00:29:40.093]  West Indies.
[00:29:40.113 --> 00:29:40.794]  You know where that is?
[00:29:40.874 --> 00:29:41.634]  Rihanna's from there.
[00:29:42.255 --> 00:29:42.615]  Wow!
[00:29:42.655 --> 00:29:43.535]  That's pretty cool.
[00:29:43.595 --> 00:29:45.317]  So, what do you think?
[00:29:45.357 --> 00:29:52.141]  Have you heard about the case of a woman named Guadalupe that's an illegal immigrant that's currently being detained in Arizona?
[00:29:52.161 --> 00:29:57.405]  And she could be being deported because she committed felony identity theft.
[00:29:57.445 --> 00:29:58.266]  What do you think about that?
[00:29:59.448 --> 00:30:00.188]  I don't know.
[00:30:00.208 --> 00:30:00.789]  I really don't know, man.
[00:30:00.809 --> 00:30:00.849]  No.
[00:30:00.869 --> 00:30:00.949]  Why?
[00:30:00.969 --> 00:30:02.709]  That doesn't make any sense, like...
[00:30:14.764 --> 00:30:21.087]  Immigrants, like, I guess, like, if you come to America and you have a visa, right, then you get a green card.
[00:30:21.727 --> 00:30:27.350]  Then there's no need to do that if, you know, if you don't have a citizenship or at least you stay in your country and try to work on it.
[00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:30.831]  If it doesn't happen, I think it's not meant to be, you know?
[00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:37.334]  Why commit a crime when you could just go through the proper process to become a legal citizen here, right?
[00:30:37.354 --> 00:30:38.295]  You can marry someone.
[00:30:38.315 --> 00:30:39.255]  You can marry someone, right?
[00:30:39.475 --> 00:30:41.796]  Maybe do that instead of stealing someone's identity.
[00:30:41.856 --> 00:30:43.617]  Find an American husband and get married.
[00:30:44.462 --> 00:30:44.762]  I don't know.
[00:30:45.302 --> 00:30:46.963]  But that's my thing on it.
[00:30:46.983 --> 00:30:49.223]  I have not thought that through fully.
[00:30:49.243 --> 00:30:49.404]  I think
[00:31:06.138 --> 00:31:13.244]  I mean, I appreciate the need to have legal methods of getting into the United States.
[00:31:14.965 --> 00:31:34.081]  I think... I mean, I guess people should be deported if they've committed some kind of terrible crime, but a felon could be a drug dealer, and in my mind that's not, you know, and not only a drug dealer, like a marijuana dealer.
[00:31:34.341 --> 00:31:34.782]  That's not...
[00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:39.914]  As vast a crime as something like... I mean, I have no opinion on that.
[00:31:54.150 --> 00:32:01.575]  It appears that many of the students here were too afraid to talk to me out of the fear that they could come off as not politically correct.
[00:32:01.976 --> 00:32:07.580]  It just goes to show how political correctness is ruining our free speech in this country.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:07.640]  Hi!
[00:32:08.941 --> 00:32:15.846]  How are y'all doing?
[00:32:16.126 --> 00:32:16.786]  Good, how are you doing?
[00:32:16.846 --> 00:32:17.527]  I'm good.
[00:32:19.531 --> 00:32:20.472]  You want to do an interview?
[00:32:20.692 --> 00:32:21.373]  No, I don't.
[00:32:21.393 --> 00:32:21.834]  Okay.
[00:32:21.854 --> 00:32:25.998]  It's not because I'm afraid of full pregnancy or anything.
[00:32:27.691 --> 00:32:33.354]  This just goes to show that how political correctness is ruining free speech in America.
[00:32:33.374 --> 00:32:44.581]  I did speak with an immigrant woman who actually would speak on the matter and she agreed that if immigrants are coming here illegally and committing crimes that they should be deported.
[00:32:44.601 --> 00:32:47.963]  This is Millie Weaver signing off for InfoWars.com
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:07.338 --> 00:37:18.166]  Well, CNN continues to show how totally out of touch they are with the majority of the American people who are concerned about terrorists taking advantage of the refugee program and coming into this country.
[00:37:18.186 --> 00:37:20.908]  This is CNN anchor Alison Camerota.
[00:37:20.948 --> 00:37:28.214]  She was speaking with Representative Sean Duffy when she said that the public should be worried more about lightning than Islamic terror.
[00:37:28.994 --> 00:37:29.435]  I don't
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.221]  It used to be true.
[00:37:49.381 --> 00:37:50.602]  This is no longer true.
[00:37:50.982 --> 00:37:55.025]  So only actually 38 Americans were killed by lightning in 2016.
[00:37:55.225 --> 00:37:57.767]  Many more killed by ISIS since then.
[00:37:57.827 --> 00:38:00.749]  And this is what Sean Duffy basically told Ms.
[00:38:00.789 --> 00:38:01.329]  Camerota.
[00:38:01.389 --> 00:38:10.035]  He said, listen, I'll just tell you, if you go to the gay nightclub in Orlando and talk about what this means to the community, and you want to compare that terror attack to lightning,
[00:38:10.956 --> 00:38:21.960]  Or go to Boston and talk to anyone who was involved in the Boston Marathon bombing, had been bombed by radical Islamic terrorists, they're not going to be very happy with that conversation.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.261]  So, lightning is random, but this is purposeful.
[00:38:25.321 --> 00:38:28.382]  This is people coming after you, attacking your communities, killing you.
[00:38:28.902 --> 00:38:38.966]  And then, so she kind of snapped back, well, I talked to people in Orlando after the Pulse nightclub shooting, and they said, love was the solution.
[00:38:39.106 --> 00:38:39.886]  And he just kind of said,
[00:38:40.066 --> 00:38:40.506]  You know what?
[00:38:40.566 --> 00:38:43.568]  Look, love doesn't quell the hearts of radical terrorists.
[00:38:43.628 --> 00:38:44.368]  I'm sorry, lady.
[00:38:44.928 --> 00:38:55.373]  And so this is in addition to what a whistleblower out of the State Department is actually kind of confirming what Duffy was talking about, just saying this refugee program is full of fraud.
[00:38:55.513 --> 00:38:59.795]  She says she supports President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily halting
[00:39:00.555 --> 00:39:08.543]  The admission of refugees from these hostile nations, but she says she doesn't think that this action goes far enough.
[00:39:08.764 --> 00:39:11.306]  Now she worked in the State Department, 25 year veteran.
[00:39:11.787 --> 00:39:16.432]  She also worked as a refugee coordinator throughout the Middle East, Africa, Russia and Cuba.
[00:39:16.852 --> 00:39:27.765]  So she's seen firsthand the abuse and fraud that permeates this refugee program and she said despite these claims that we have this enhanced vetting, the fact is people are coming from nations they have no official record.
[00:39:27.805 --> 00:39:32.311]  It's virtually impossible to vet what they're telling you and often U.S.
[00:39:32.731 --> 00:39:35.975]  immigration officials rely simply on the person's
[00:39:36.616 --> 00:39:39.278]  Often rehearsed and fabricated testimony.
[00:39:39.318 --> 00:39:41.660]  She's personally seen it on hundreds of occasions.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:47.864]  And of course, we have plenty of examples of this with with other terror attacks that have taken place in Europe.
[00:39:47.904 --> 00:39:50.085]  They use fake IDs.
[00:39:50.145 --> 00:39:51.947]  Those are vital for terror networks.
[00:39:52.067 --> 00:39:54.949]  Fake passports found in Greek refugee camps.
[00:39:55.409 --> 00:40:02.894]  The terror suspects in Europe were getting welfare benefits while they're plotting these attacks because they were using many different names.
[00:40:02.994 --> 00:40:03.354]  We have
[00:40:04.255 --> 00:40:11.859]  A lot of these refugees using fake beards and glasses to go into the welfare offices and commit welfare fraud.
[00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.321]  So we know that they're doing this and they're giving this fake testimony.
[00:40:15.381 --> 00:40:26.127]  Perfect example with this most recent rapist in Sweden who got a lesser sentence because he said he was only 17 at the time, even though he told the officials initially that he was actually 18.
[00:40:26.627 --> 00:40:29.909]  But then he changed his story and they took him on his word.
[00:40:30.389 --> 00:40:59.849]  So now we had in 2015 FBI director James Comey basically underscoring that saying the vetting of refugees was virtually impossible and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper is on the record saying I Don't obviously put it past the likes of ISIL to infiltrate operatives among these refugees That's a huge concern of theirs Hillary Clinton as well text of a speech discovered She gave in 2013 where she admitted that jihadists are coming in along with legitimate refugees
[00:41:00.189 --> 00:41:11.241]  Despite this knowledge, she still went on to ramp up and increase by 550% the amount of refugees that had already been admitted by the Obama administration.
[00:41:11.261 --> 00:41:19.549]  And this whistleblower here, Mary Deutsch, she just goes on to talk about many inconsistencies, lapses in this program.
[00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:28.856]  And it under the Obama administration that just continue to expand it blindly without any thought of the repercussions of this without any worry.
[00:41:28.896 --> 00:41:35.140]  And so this is why Donald Trump wanted to kind of defend his temporary travel ban.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:41.625]  So he released a list of two dozen terror suspects that have been allowed into the US from these banned countries.
[00:41:42.345 --> 00:41:53.598]  And this is to contradict the assertion of that Seattle judge, James Robart, who halted the executive order, who said since 9-11 there have been zero arrests, as far as he could tell, from terrorists.
[00:41:53.879 --> 00:42:01.788]  But indeed, here is a list of at least 24 individuals who've all been arrested on terror charges, and the majority of them were convicted.
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:14.044]  Former Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions will now be addressed as Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
[00:42:14.304 --> 00:42:27.711]  Last night's vote of confirmation finally tallied after the Democrats waged a marathon of shallow character assassinations on the integrity of Jeff Sessions' candidacy as the most powerful lawyer in the land.
[00:42:28.031 --> 00:42:35.695]  Senator Sessions' voting, views on voting rights and in mind and understanding how he responded to the President's
[00:42:36.596 --> 00:42:42.238]  I start my remarks tonight aggrieved by what I saw happen to Elizabeth Warren.
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:16.182]  Of course, Senator Elizabeth Warren had been silenced as she violated protocol whilst playing the Democrats' weapon of choice, the race card.
[00:43:16.382 --> 00:43:30.246]  And the senator played a key role in shaping what has become the most extreme, most divisive, and most dangerous immigration policies of any president in decades.
[00:43:31.593 --> 00:43:35.755]  Senator Sessions' radical views are not limited to immigration.
[00:43:36.696 --> 00:43:47.242]  On issue after issue after issue, Senator Sessions has displayed open hostility to the rights of all Americans.
[00:43:47.902 --> 00:43:54.245]  He has made derogatory and racist comments that should have no place in our justice system.
[00:43:54.886 --> 00:43:55.306]  Mr. President.
[00:43:55.366 --> 00:43:57.047]  They are- Majority Leader.
[00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:57.547]  Mr. President.
[00:43:57.867 --> 00:43:58.488]  The Majority Leader.
[00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:04.872]  The Senator has impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama, as warned by the Chair.
[00:44:05.612 --> 00:44:15.356]  Senator Warren, quote, said Senator Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens.
[00:44:16.216 --> 00:44:18.617]  I call the Senator to order under the provisions of Rule 19.
[00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:39.398]  CNN came to her aid, claiming the Senate has silenced Elizabeth Warren, and by doing so, majority Republicans just handed the liberal firebrand a megaphone, further elevating President Donald Trump's fiercest and most prominent critic in the Senate, and turning her into a Democratic hero.
[00:44:39.598 --> 00:44:43.281]  When the smoke and mirrors had cleared, the truth was to be told.
[00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:49.806]  Warren had managed to play the race card so obviously in the name of civil rights leader Coretta Scott King,
[00:44:50.831 --> 00:45:02.399]  Senator Sessions, it's a great honor and privilege for me to join you in celebrating the grand opening of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum.
[00:45:02.419 --> 00:45:11.765]  MLK's niece responded saying, if we take a look at my aunt Coretta Scott King's letter, we know that she was a peacemaker.
[00:45:12.326 --> 00:45:15.688]  Her intentions were never to divide during her whole life.
[00:45:15.828 --> 00:45:19.551]  And so in that letter, she would be referring to perhaps some of
[00:45:20.291 --> 00:45:27.776]  His comments, however, she would agree today that he of course ended some school desegregation.
[00:45:28.136 --> 00:45:31.498]  He worked to prosecute members of the KKK.
[00:45:31.898 --> 00:45:38.202]  Aunt Coretta was a very reasonable woman and she, with integrity, would have noted that he had done some great work.
[00:45:38.542 --> 00:45:48.389]  Attorney General Jeff Sessions may not have the support of the Democrats, but he does have the support of the voters who wish to see the swamp drained in Washington, D.C.
[00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:51.612]  A recently retired 25-year veteran of the U.S.
[00:45:51.752 --> 00:45:54.874]  Department of State had this to say about Jeff Sessions.
[00:45:55.094 --> 00:46:01.036]  I fully support President Donald Trump's executive order that temporarily halts admissions from the U.S.
[00:46:01.136 --> 00:46:09.079]  Refugee Admissions Program and bans travel from nationals of countries that potentially pose a security risk to the United States.
[00:46:09.439 --> 00:46:12.360]  However, I don't think the action goes far enough.
[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:22.764]  I have seen firsthand the abuses and fraud that permeate the refugee program and know about the entrenched interests that fight every effort to implement much-needed reform.
[00:46:23.024 --> 00:46:27.367]  Quoted from a letter published in the Chicago Tribune from recently retired U.S.
[00:46:27.407 --> 00:46:29.289]  State Department veteran Mary Doach.
[00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:33.912]  It is time to put away childish race-baiting tactics, liberals.
[00:46:34.152 --> 00:46:41.237]  The United States is going to get on with the business of protecting its interest in national security with or without you.
[00:46:41.417 --> 00:46:46.801]  Denigrating people who disagree with us, I think is not a healthy trend for our body.
[00:46:47.081 --> 00:46:49.043]  John Bound for InfoWars.com
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.848]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.028 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.414]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.435 --> 00:48:49.476]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.816 --> 00:48:50.497]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.557 --> 00:48:51.158]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.519 --> 00:48:59.069]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.089 --> 00:48:59.970]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.030]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:18.297]  Vice President Mike Pence cast a historic vote during the Senate confirmation of Betsy DeVos, Donald Trump's cabinet pick for Secretary of Education.
[00:49:18.537 --> 00:49:21.379]  On this vote, the yeas are 50, the nays are 50.
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:30.045]  The Senate being equally divided, the Vice President votes in the affirmative and the nomination is confirmed.
[00:49:30.839 --> 00:49:54.217]  Now, Davos is going to play a very crucial role in allowing Donald Trump to fulfill his campaign promises in education, which are getting rid of Common Core, which we've all seen the disastrous effects from, making it so that students can pick their own schools, this is going to be great for people that live in poverty-ridden areas, and dismantling the Department of Education.
[00:49:54.697 --> 00:49:58.759]  Well, we've seen with Ronald Reagan how he failed to do this.
[00:49:58.819 --> 00:50:03.360]  He actually tried and did not accomplish the goal of dismantling the Department of Education.
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:06.401]  Better education doesn't mean a bigger Department of Education.
[00:50:06.642 --> 00:50:08.542]  In fact, that department should be abolished.
[00:50:09.102 --> 00:50:16.085]  And above all, remembering that education does not begin with Washington officials, or even state and local officials.
[00:50:16.785 --> 00:50:20.847]  It begins in the home, where it is the right and responsibility of every American.
[00:50:21.252 --> 00:50:32.237]  Now a woman named Charlotte Isserby, who wrote the book, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of Americans, actually worked in the Department of Education and stole some documents right before she left.
[00:50:32.597 --> 00:50:42.021]  Now these documents had detailed descriptions of their plan to deliberately instill propaganda and disinformation in the school systems.
[00:50:42.181 --> 00:50:47.183]  The Carnegie Endowment trustees reasoned that if they could get control, here we go, of education,
[00:50:47.803 --> 00:50:51.768]  To dumb down Americans so that you would have a subservient, easily controlled population
[00:51:06.724 --> 00:51:16.895]  Well, they have been very successful and we've seen the results so far with these SJW Millennials that are out there completely brainwashed and do not know what they're talking about.
[00:51:17.515 --> 00:51:24.382]  They trust the authoritarian figures and they refuse to question authority or the fake news that's out there.
[00:51:25.023 --> 00:51:39.492]  So it's very important that we allow Betsy DeVos to do her job and Donald Trump to fulfill his campaign promise to dismantle the Department of Education so we can stop the propaganda and indoctrination of our children.
[00:51:39.872 --> 00:51:43.854]  Stay tuned, I will be keeping you guys updated with more reports just like this.
[00:51:43.974 --> 00:51:46.916]  This is Millie Weaver, signing off for InfoWars.com.
[00:51:52.944 --> 00:51:55.165]  Today what we have is a tale of two mothers.
[00:51:55.286 --> 00:51:57.987]  One that you hear about on every network is covering this.
[00:51:58.087 --> 00:51:59.608]  Big pictures, very emotional.
[00:51:59.628 --> 00:52:01.670]  You're hearing about it every couple of minutes on the networks.
[00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:04.492]  The other is a story of a mother that you haven't heard.
[00:52:04.512 --> 00:52:08.174]  Now both of these mothers have been separated from their families for different reasons.
[00:52:08.194 --> 00:52:10.216]  Let me tell you about the one that you haven't heard about today.
[00:52:10.996 --> 00:52:14.800]  This is a mother in Buffalo who decided she wanted to homeschool her children.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:17.843]  Her name is Kiara Harris, single mother.
[00:52:18.343 --> 00:52:26.671]  She started researching homeschooling in November because she said her two elementary school children weren't excelling at the failing public schools in Buffalo.
[00:52:26.711 --> 00:52:31.816]  She said, I felt the district was failing my children and that's when I made the decision to homeschool.
[00:52:32.596 --> 00:52:34.859]  In other words, she wanted to take responsibility for her children.
[00:52:35.419 --> 00:52:36.600]  She wanted to follow the rules.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.941]  So she goes down, she files documents at City Hall.
[00:52:39.381 --> 00:52:41.402]  She informed the district of her intent to homeschool.
[00:52:41.802 --> 00:52:53.629]  According to documents that she provided to the local TV station, because this is the only people that are covering it nationwide, except for us, 7 Eyewitness News, she said they dated, they saw the paperwork that was dated December 7th.
[00:52:53.649 --> 00:52:55.670]  The district said it received her paperwork.
[00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:57.811]  She said, I spoke directly to the homeschool coordinator.
[00:52:58.331 --> 00:53:03.176]  She told me this point on my children was unofficially unenrolled from the school.
[00:53:03.236 --> 00:53:08.701]  But then, a week later, she gets a call from Child Protective Services, CPS.
[00:53:09.582 --> 00:53:11.224]  Why aren't your kids in school, they said.
[00:53:12.318 --> 00:53:13.979]  She said, I told them my kids were homeschooled.
[00:53:13.999 --> 00:53:16.239]  I told them that I'd filled out all the information.
[00:53:16.339 --> 00:53:18.360]  I told them the documents were on file with City Hall.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.281]  Then she said, she thought everything was fine.
[00:53:21.341 --> 00:53:22.462]  She goes on homeschooling.
[00:53:23.082 --> 00:53:29.764]  Less than a month later, she was confronted by CPS workers and police who came to take her children away from her.
[00:53:30.744 --> 00:53:35.306]  When she said no, they arrested her for obstruction.
[00:53:35.906 --> 00:53:36.786]  That was three weeks ago.
[00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:39.047]  She hasn't seen her children since.
[00:53:39.167 --> 00:53:40.788]  They've been in a foster institution.
[00:53:41.957 --> 00:53:43.218]  That's the story you're not hearing about.
[00:53:44.158 --> 00:53:51.623]  The mom who wants to take responsibility for her kids, who wants to do better, who follows the rules, and now is being victimized by the system.
[00:53:52.483 --> 00:53:54.384]  Now here's a story that you've heard about all day today.
[00:53:55.004 --> 00:54:01.008]  This is the story of the mother who has been arrested by ICE in Phoenix, Arizona, and there were protests.
[00:54:01.448 --> 00:54:02.789]  Seven of them were arrested.
[00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:04.130]  Now the interesting thing is,
[00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:06.731]  The protesters were already in place.
[00:54:07.232 --> 00:54:08.132]  They already had their signs.
[00:54:08.433 --> 00:54:09.153]  They're already there.
[00:54:09.573 --> 00:54:15.157]  They knew that she was going to be going for her annual inspection with ICE and there's a story behind that.
[00:54:15.197 --> 00:54:16.018]  We'll tell you about that.
[00:54:16.478 --> 00:54:19.380]  But everything was already prepared for the cameras.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.022]  Everything was set up and I think
[00:54:22.662 --> 00:54:37.728]  That when we look at this and we look at the story that came out in the Washington Post just about three weeks ago, January the 13th, in a remarkable exchange with an undocumented mom, Paul Ryan exposes the cruelty of Trumpism.
[00:54:38.269 --> 00:54:38.829]  A Trumpism.
[00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:50.197]  Now, you have to understand, the GOP establishment, not just the Democrat politicians, but also the GOP establishment politicians like Paul Ryan, want to see this change in immigration fail.
[00:54:50.637 --> 00:54:52.018]  They don't want to see our borders patrolled.
[00:54:52.498 --> 00:54:53.659]  They don't want to protect families.
[00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:57.500]  Parents and children being separated.
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:09.829]  Let's understand that for many parents the separation is permanent because their children have been killed by violent criminals and this revolving door that's at the border and part of our justice system.
[00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:15.574]  They get picked up for a crime, even a serious crime, and maybe they get deported or maybe they go to jail for a little while.
[00:55:15.654 --> 00:55:17.756]  Most of the time they get deported and then they just come right back in.
[00:55:18.276 --> 00:55:18.877]  There's no problem.
[00:55:19.798 --> 00:55:23.441]  So that is the situation that is not being seen in either of these cases.
[00:55:23.481 --> 00:55:25.662]  But I want to tell you about this particular instance.
[00:55:25.702 --> 00:55:32.347]  And of course, when we look at the pictures, and this is all for the, you know, the motion, tugging at your motion, showing what's going on.
[00:55:32.728 --> 00:55:35.169]  Look at the picture that they put up of the mother.
[00:55:35.229 --> 00:55:37.971]  There you can see her, attractive middle-aged woman.
[00:55:38.432 --> 00:55:41.754]  She's looking longingly through the bars behind glass.
[00:55:41.954 --> 00:55:42.955]  She's being taken away.
[00:55:42.975 --> 00:55:47.138]  It says, it's the Washington Post, for years, immigration authorities gave this mother a pass.
[00:55:47.158 --> 00:55:49.320]  But on Wednesday, when she checked in with them, they seized her.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:50.220]  Oh, who knew?
[00:55:50.661 --> 00:55:51.141]  Well, they knew.
[00:55:51.341 --> 00:55:53.583]  And they were set up, ready to go with it, okay?
[00:55:54.003 --> 00:56:03.649]  Now, according to CNN, immigration officials said she was detained, quote, based on a removal order issued by the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review, which became final in May of 2013.
[00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:12.876]  They said relevant databases indicate that she had a prior felony conviction dating from March 2009 for criminal impersonation.
[00:56:13.556 --> 00:56:14.397]  Now understand what this says.
[00:56:14.417 --> 00:56:16.219]  She had exhausted all of her appeals.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:21.264]  Criminal impersonation is, as the LA Times characterized it, identity theft.
[00:56:22.005 --> 00:56:23.767]  She had a fake social security number.
[00:56:23.807 --> 00:56:25.569]  She was working with a fake social security number.
[00:56:26.009 --> 00:56:29.973]  What happens to the person whose social security number that actually represents?
[00:56:30.734 --> 00:56:34.699]  See, when you take somebody's social security number, they're going to get a letter from the IRS.
[00:56:34.739 --> 00:56:40.886]  It's a very serious thing to lie to the government, to take somebody else's identity, to steal that identity.
[00:56:40.946 --> 00:56:44.229]  But of course, she came into this country in violation of the laws anyway.
[00:56:44.269 --> 00:56:45.150]  She's a foreign citizen.
[00:56:45.711 --> 00:56:49.535]  And what they were telling her at the time, the judge did not send her to prison.
[00:56:49.595 --> 00:56:52.819]  Understand, she got a felony class 6, which is the lowest felony charge.
[00:56:53.179 --> 00:56:58.364]  She could have gotten a class 1 misdemeanor, which is the highest misdemeanor charge.
[00:56:58.404 --> 00:57:01.788]  The class 1 misdemeanor, if that had been given to her, would have been a 6 month jail sentence.
[00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:06.193]  With a class 6 felony, that was 1 to 2 years in jail.
[00:57:07.614 --> 00:57:10.235]  The judge said, you can voluntarily deport.
[00:57:10.816 --> 00:57:11.816]  She chose not to do that.
[00:57:12.336 --> 00:57:16.518]  And then the Obama administration said, we're not going to have her deported.
[00:57:16.538 --> 00:57:17.759]  We're not going to send her to prison.
[00:57:18.019 --> 00:57:21.961]  She just has to show up every year to talk to ICE.
[00:57:22.721 --> 00:57:24.282]  Now the rules have changed.
[00:57:24.722 --> 00:57:32.286]  And people who have a felony conviction, and I have to say, when we look at this, just as I said, when you're doing identity theft, where do we draw the line on this?
[00:57:32.346 --> 00:57:34.707]  How many passes do people get with this?
[00:57:35.327 --> 00:57:37.147]  Take a look at the VW executive.
[00:57:37.207 --> 00:57:39.648]  This guy, his company got four billion dollars.
[00:57:39.968 --> 00:57:42.628]  He's looking at 139 years in jail from the EPA.
[00:57:42.869 --> 00:57:43.069]  Why?
[00:57:43.149 --> 00:57:44.909]  Because he lied to the government.
[00:57:44.969 --> 00:57:50.870]  If you lie to the FBI, that could be a more serious crime than the crime that they're calling you in to question you for.
[00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:59.332]  So the government doesn't take it politely when people lie to them, except if you're an illegal alien, if you are a foreign citizen here illegally.
[00:57:59.352 --> 00:58:04.713]  And understand that if she chose to voluntarily deport, her family could voluntarily deport with her to be with her.
[00:58:05.273 --> 00:58:11.297]  That's a very different deal than people who are separated from their families because they commit a felony and go to jail.
[00:58:11.738 --> 00:58:17.222]  But of course we have criminals who have civil liberties and special rights as immigrants.
[00:58:17.242 --> 00:58:19.824]  We've now seen with the court in California
[00:58:20.444 --> 00:58:25.165]  That there is now a newly discovered right of immigration that is not in the Constitution.
[00:58:25.445 --> 00:58:28.206]  Just like the right to kill your child is not in the Constitution.
[00:58:28.506 --> 00:58:40.929]  So they keep discovering these rights and yet we keep losing our rights just as this mother in New York is separated from her children even though she followed all the rules and tried to act responsibly for her own children.
[00:58:41.610 --> 00:58:43.130]  For InfoWars, I'm David Knight.
