[00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:24.094]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:25.495]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:30.741]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:56.966]  Progress!
[00:00:57.727 --> 00:00:59.988]  Knowingly exposing others to HIV.
[00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.769]  No longer a felony.
[00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.991]  It is the same as a parking ticket.
[00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.352]  The lowest level misdemeanor.
[00:01:06.372 --> 00:01:13.717]  So you knowingly give somebody a virus that can cause an autoimmune disease that makes you slowly die over five to ten years.
[00:01:14.457 --> 00:01:15.518]  But that's okay.
[00:01:15.838 --> 00:01:18.340]  Governor Jerry Brown signed it.
[00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:21.066]  And talked about equality.
[00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:31.231]  Well, it's not evil to have a disease, be it leprosy, HIV, hepatitis, whatever, but it's certainly evil to give it to someone.
[00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:34.092]  But they're saying no, that's okay.
[00:01:34.112 --> 00:01:41.556]  And I want to get into the psychology of the insane Democratic Party here, because when HIV goes from lower numbers like it is to exploding in the next five years,
[00:01:42.982 --> 00:01:45.464]  In a few years, we're still here as a planet.
[00:01:45.904 --> 00:01:46.705]  Don't have nuclear war.
[00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:56.351]  I will go back to this show and say, here I am in 2017 saying, within three to five years, California will have a 200% increase in HIV.
[00:01:56.452 --> 00:01:57.812]  Glad to be here at the AIDS Walk.
[00:01:57.853 --> 00:01:59.814]  Really important for getting the message out.
[00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:06.096]  They will also complain and say we need single payer, we need socialist healthcare, the reason we have HIV is because we don't have free healthcare.
[00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:15.419]  No, the reason we have HIV is because it is a culture now in the gay community, that I first read about 20 years ago in Rolling Stone, to give other people HIV.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.240]  It's truly nihilistic.
[00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:19.161]  So here's the article.
[00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:21.482]  Progress, LA Times.
[00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:28.044]  Knowingly exposing others to HIV, no longer a felony in California, it's the same thing
[00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:31.068]  As a parking ticket.
[00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.210]  So it's essentially legalized.
[00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:34.731]  And here's the LA Times.
[00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:42.258]  Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill Friday that lowers from a felony to misdemeanor the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV without disclosing the infection.
[00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.519]  How about hepatitis?
[00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:44.280]  How about everything else?
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.844]  The measure also applies to those who give blood without telling blood bank they're HIV positive.
[00:02:49.024 --> 00:02:49.645]  Oh wow!
[00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:52.948]  Don't tell the blood bank you're HIV positive.
[00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:54.629]  This is a religion.
[00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:55.931]  This is Satanism, folks.
[00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:59.213]  Because if they can get away with this thing or with anything, this is totally insane.
[00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:04.957]  Remember the Clintons for over a decade knew that all the blood coming out of their prisons was infected with HIV and hepatitis?
[00:03:05.698 --> 00:03:05.958]  All of it.
[00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:17.987]  Because they would mix it together, and they would sell it into Canada, and say it was all clean, and then Bayer would buy it, turn it into Factor VIII, and Bayer knew it all had HIV in it, and they still shipped it out as population reduction.
[00:03:18.548 --> 00:03:19.288]  It's in the documents.
[00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:19.909]  So...
[00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.334]  This takes bug chasing to a whole new level.
[00:03:23.554 --> 00:03:28.476]  This isn't two guys getting together in a bar bathroom or wherever, okay?
[00:03:29.017 --> 00:03:35.100]  This is children, hemophiliacs, getting it and there's a religion.
[00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:41.499]  This is mainstream news of giving people HIV and then AIDS, of killing them, and then of wanting to get killed.
[00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.960]  But see, that's not enough of a thrill.
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:52.305]  It's more of a sacrament for Jerry Brown to destroy the entire blood industry, to destroy it even further, and then let the entire U.S.
[00:03:52.325 --> 00:03:54.107]  blood supply be tainted again.
[00:03:54.867 --> 00:04:00.909]  But it's okay, it's like it's okay to teach five-year-olds, you know, that they're not really a man or not really a woman, that they're really something else in school.
[00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:06.031]  Pedophilia being normalized by mainstream news, by the New York Times, by Salon.
[00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:09.732]  It's all about how far can they push you, what can they get away with.
[00:04:10.865 --> 00:04:12.266]  So let me read this again from the LA Times.
[00:04:12.406 --> 00:04:19.892]  Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill Friday that lowers from a felony to a misdemeanor the crime of knowingly exposing a sexual partner to HIV without disclosing the infection.
[00:04:20.392 --> 00:04:24.475]  The measure also applies to those who give blood without telling the blood bank they're HIV positive.
[00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:32.781]  So you can go in, give them the blood, it infects the entire system, and you kill a bunch of people, but it's liberal, so it's like, well it's liberal!
[00:04:34.062 --> 00:04:37.044]  California hepatitis, an outbreak on the verge of a statewide epidemic.
[00:04:37.324 --> 00:04:39.387]  Well, hell, that's a good thing in California!
[00:05:04.975 --> 00:05:08.378]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:05:08.738 --> 00:05:15.864]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:05:16.485 --> 00:05:24.852]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:05:25.092 --> 00:05:29.196]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:05:29.536 --> 00:05:33.299]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastic,
[00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:33.679]  We're good.
[00:06:05.222 --> 00:06:06.964]  You know, Australia is a good example.
[00:06:07.184 --> 00:06:08.485]  Canada is a good example.
[00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:10.727]  The UK is a good example.
[00:06:10.788 --> 00:06:11.028]  Why?
[00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:14.105]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[00:06:14.586 --> 00:06:19.767]  Somebody somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.
[00:06:20.567 --> 00:06:23.107]  Well, this is something we should politicize.
[00:06:23.788 --> 00:06:24.728]  I'm not going to carry a gun.
[00:06:24.748 --> 00:06:26.428]  I don't want to be involved in a gun fight.
[00:06:26.568 --> 00:06:39.131]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.119]  Go ahead.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.041]  Make my day.
[00:06:47.702 --> 00:06:51.645]  So the notion that gun laws don't work is not borne out by the evidence.
[00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:57.491]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend.
[00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:06.379]  Nonetheless, as you indicated, Corey, there was a count of casualties that could have been from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:07.200]  We'll make it.
[00:07:08.422 --> 00:07:11.305]  Harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns.
[00:07:11.746 --> 00:07:18.934]  In many cases the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[00:07:19.274 --> 00:07:26.241]  We have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.
[00:07:26.402 --> 00:07:29.845]  There are people at high levels in this government who have
[00:07:30.906 --> 00:07:32.348]  Bodyguards.
[00:07:32.588 --> 00:07:34.471]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:36.893]  The average American does not have that.
[00:07:37.254 --> 00:07:43.040]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not the majority of Americans?
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.123]  I mean, look at the team of security you got.
[00:07:45.603 --> 00:07:47.905]  Every day, every school, at every level.
[00:07:48.445 --> 00:08:01.213]  One thing that I think is clear with young people, and with adults as well, is that we just have to be repetitive about this, and we need to do this every day of the week, and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:08:01.613 --> 00:08:05.196]  Was this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist?
[00:08:05.556 --> 00:08:13.082]  When a five-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles, the school called it a terrorist threat.
[00:08:13.542 --> 00:08:16.664]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[00:08:17.405 --> 00:08:21.548]  You know, the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny.
[00:08:21.988 --> 00:08:24.010]  Lay down your arms, you damn rebels!
[00:08:25.711 --> 00:08:29.532]  But we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police.
[00:08:29.852 --> 00:08:31.652]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:32.692]  would you see that happening?
[00:08:32.752 --> 00:08:36.753]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:08:37.193 --> 00:08:42.454]  Discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[00:08:42.854 --> 00:08:50.536]  To say we're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not knocking down, if you want them, come and take them!
[00:08:51.136 --> 00:08:55.839]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:08:56.159 --> 00:09:10.327]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:09:10.827 --> 00:09:15.990]  They are preparing a violent overthrow sometime in November, October.
[00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.532]  Now, why do you think the communists are suddenly uncloaking themselves?
[00:09:21.428 --> 00:09:30.094]  Because after growing under the floorboards, they want to look like a legitimate government when they take over and when they call for the racial war, when they call for the uprising.
[00:09:31.074 --> 00:09:33.396]  This is a playbook and it's from them.
[00:09:33.596 --> 00:09:38.339]  They're saying this is happening and they're being allowed to prepare and gear up for it.
[00:09:41.961 --> 00:09:44.663]  What will it be in a month?
[00:09:50.336 --> 00:09:52.238]  What will it be in just a few weeks?
[00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:54.139]  What will it be?
[00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:56.882]  It snuck up on us, hasn't it?
[00:09:57.502 --> 00:10:04.248]  It's the October Revolution that stretched into November and December.
[00:10:04.788 --> 00:10:10.353]  It's the 100-year anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
[00:10:11.314 --> 00:10:11.654]  We're here.
[00:10:12.635 --> 00:10:13.296]  It's happening now.
[00:10:15.978 --> 00:10:16.418]  This is real.
[00:10:17.827 --> 00:10:18.768]  What are you going to do about it?
[00:10:18.788 --> 00:10:20.049]  It's a big question you've got to ask yourself.
[00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.132]  Because they mean business.
[00:10:27.855 --> 00:10:29.036]  We have to hold our fire.
[00:10:31.938 --> 00:10:34.920]  But we have to be prepared and know they're coming over the line.
[00:10:36.241 --> 00:10:39.083]  And we've got to be on target and ready.
[00:10:40.524 --> 00:10:41.966]  And everybody's got to start packing.
[00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:44.828]  Because when they strike,
[00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:58.510]  It'll be like fire ants, where they crawl up over your legs, when they get in place, one of them that's leading, and it's all genetically engineered, you know, by Mother Nature that way, stings you, releases a pheromone, and all the others sting.
[00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:01.312]  Once they get in place, they communicate by pheromones.
[00:11:03.292 --> 00:11:04.193]  And it's the same thing.
[00:11:04.393 --> 00:11:07.894]  They get all over you, they get in place, and it's gonna be boom!
[00:11:07.974 --> 00:11:11.096]  You wake up one morning, and 300 cops are dead.
[00:11:11.856 --> 00:11:13.497]  You wake up, and talk show host,
[00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.150]  And members of Congress are wiped out.
[00:11:19.373 --> 00:11:25.043]  Trump Towers from Chicago to New York are on fire.
[00:11:25.904 --> 00:11:27.687]  So the police don't think they can respond.
[00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:33.442]  But there'll be something that happens right before that.
[00:11:34.262 --> 00:11:42.065]  A mass shooting at a school, a bombing of a federal building, maybe more, pinned on a right-wing patsy who's a listener of this show.
[00:11:42.666 --> 00:11:51.809]  That's why they're putting us all over the news and putting us on Comedy Central with all their drooling viewers to go, here's the bad guy, here's the terrorist, get ready for this.
[00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.570]  When it all happens, it's his fault.
[00:11:55.411 --> 00:11:56.831]  He made his followers do it.
[00:11:57.291 --> 00:11:58.332]  So they false flag
[00:12:00.748 --> 00:12:07.072]  And they'll blame Alex Jones, and Donald Trump, and Matt Drudge, and Rush Limbaugh.
[00:12:09.374 --> 00:12:16.638]  And even a lot of other conservative talk show hosts will kind of halfway go along with it because they'll think, oh, my competition's about to get shut down.
[00:12:16.978 --> 00:12:18.900]  No, idiot, you're about to get shut down.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.381]  Bolshevik style.
[00:12:20.421 --> 00:12:20.921]  That's how it worked.
[00:12:20.941 --> 00:12:22.842]  The Bolsheviks said, we've just seized Moscow.
[00:12:24.163 --> 00:12:29.787]  But if you turn in your guns and work with us and some of the other political parties, we'll let you rule with us.
[00:12:30.874 --> 00:12:42.264]  And just help us get the white Russians, just help us get the Christian Russians, just help us get the pro-Tsarists, just help us get that one group, and then you're gonna be fine.
[00:12:42.284 --> 00:12:46.848]  And then they just killed people with each new group of moron traitors that lowered the drawbridge.
[00:12:50.356 --> 00:12:57.839]  We're here, and I'm sure of it, that this whole NFL thing was the activation of this, and my sources concur with that.
[00:12:58.139 --> 00:12:59.280]  It's not gone well for them.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:16.367]  So, if there's a big terror attack that they blame on patriots or Christians or conservatives or independent media, because that's what they want to shut down, not if, when, you'll have two or three days of them hyping it to get people to a fever pitch, so they can make it look like it was organic.
[00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:18.968]  But by the second or third night, you've got to be
[00:13:20.111 --> 00:13:25.055]  You want to stop these folks, you got to be basically eyes and ears, and they're going to hit at night.
[00:13:25.836 --> 00:13:27.718]  They're going to start at about 10 o'clock at night.
[00:13:28.658 --> 00:13:31.941]  You got to be waiting on them two to three days after.
[00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:34.103]  I don't think they're going to change their operation.
[00:13:34.123 --> 00:13:35.224]  This is too tried and true.
[00:13:35.985 --> 00:13:42.891]  You got to be waiting for them, ladies and gentlemen, because they're going to try to overwhelm the police forces in cities they don't control first.
[00:13:44.072 --> 00:13:44.993]  They're going to lay them out.
[00:13:46.633 --> 00:13:52.258]  They may also do it in cities they control because they know the police chief will be involved in it and will order basically a stand down.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.523]  So, they're gonna make their move.
[00:13:57.543 --> 00:13:59.725]  That's where everybody's on edge.
[00:14:02.548 --> 00:14:04.830]  And we've really tried to fix this as peacefully as we can.
[00:14:10.231 --> 00:14:30.087]  If the Attorney General, who's completely surrounded I know, doesn't move on these forces, you need to understand, the Antifa idiots are just going to be the cover for the squads and some of the other specialized groups that they're going to be using to decapitate, and they think intimidate and confuse, Patriot government.
[00:14:31.957 --> 00:14:35.159]  But you better believe they're going to try to kill conservative Supreme Court justices.
[00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:38.560]  You better believe they're going to try to kill Judge Roy Moore, people like that.
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.542]  I mean, folks, you know, they're coming for you.
[00:14:45.003 --> 00:14:46.144]  They're coming for you.
[00:14:48.565 --> 00:14:52.507]  October is only a few days away.
[00:14:53.427 --> 00:14:56.929]  They're saying their operation launches November 4th.
[00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.591]  That's probably a diversion.
[00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:07.333]  I think the attack's coming in the middle of October.
[00:15:09.396 --> 00:15:10.977]  That's just looking at all the pieces.
[00:15:11.998 --> 00:15:19.046]  I'd say look for middle of October, but first look for a new Charlottesville, much bigger, or a group of Charlottesville.
[00:15:19.526 --> 00:15:22.650]  That's going to be the cover for the detonation.
[00:15:27.768 --> 00:15:41.678]  That's just one of the videos clipped out of the live show from Friday, September 28, 2017, where I said I think they'd attack at like something like 10 o'clock at night to trigger the revolution.
[00:15:42.138 --> 00:15:48.883]  And I had some FBI folks call up some of our team and say, how did Alex know that?
[00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:51.187]  What are his sources?
[00:15:51.527 --> 00:15:52.628]  Does he have any information?
[00:15:53.248 --> 00:15:54.969]  And I said, yeah, it's the Democratic Party.
[00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:59.092]  Soros and all the liberals are saying, come October 1st, we're coming to kill you.
[00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:01.513]  And I said, they'd probably attack at 10 o'clock at night.
[00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:04.295]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running.
[00:16:05.566 --> 00:16:10.889]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:12.269]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[00:16:12.529 --> 00:16:14.831]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:16:15.491 --> 00:16:22.014]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:25.556]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[00:16:25.856 --> 00:16:27.677]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:16:28.317 --> 00:16:36.748]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:16:36.768 --> 00:16:37.729]  They know how great it is.
[00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:42.435]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:16:43.256 --> 00:16:44.698]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:53.384]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:16:53.824 --> 00:17:02.569]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.291]  That comes to $50.03.
[00:17:05.411 --> 00:17:09.474]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:17:09.894 --> 00:17:12.856]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:17:15.197 --> 00:17:16.057]  It's a good deal at $39.

[00:18:27.133 --> 00:18:35.982]  I'm gonna have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[00:18:36.542 --> 00:18:37.183]  Concentrate.
[00:18:37.203 --> 00:18:38.984]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:40.665]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:18:40.905 --> 00:18:42.527]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:18:42.927 --> 00:18:43.808]  It's incredible.
[00:18:44.288 --> 00:18:46.189]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:47.530]  It's bigger than I am already.
[00:18:47.991 --> 00:18:48.891]  At 15, incredible.
[00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:50.092]  It is amazing.
[00:18:50.453 --> 00:18:51.714]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:52.494 --> 00:18:54.836]  50% off Caveman, but only a few days left.
[00:18:55.076 --> 00:18:55.837]  It's about to end.
[00:18:56.417 --> 00:18:58.759]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:04.365]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[00:19:04.785 --> 00:19:06.187]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:19:06.447 --> 00:19:07.588]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:19:07.968 --> 00:19:08.769]  I want to thank you.
[00:19:09.109 --> 00:19:10.171]  We're all in this together.

[00:19:26.804 --> 00:19:36.729]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.

[00:20:06.028 --> 00:20:08.630]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.386 --> 00:20:14.966]  We've got it.
[00:20:15.026 --> 00:20:21.448]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:20:21.528 --> 00:20:23.629]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:25.889 --> 00:20:31.631]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:33.471 --> 00:20:36.092]  What's behind the entire Weinstein firestorm?
[00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:47.233]  All that's behind it is, Hollywood's collapsing.
[00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:48.795]  The money's not there anymore.
[00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:52.518]  And the rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[00:20:54.019 --> 00:21:03.007]  The Matt Damon's and others, the Ben Affleck's are being forced to reverse their cover-ups for Mr. Weinstein.
[00:21:03.147 --> 00:21:07.891]  And as the invincibility aura dissipates,
[00:21:10.455 --> 00:21:37.774]  The pedophilia is going to come out next, and that's what they feel nipping at their heels, breathing down their necks, is the fact that the American people, and patriots in law enforcement, and the populist Trump revolution, and this broadcast, is all just part of a worldwide move against the satanic pedophile elites.
[00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:45.875]  Hungary's government has come out and declared George Soros a quote, agent of Satan.
[00:21:49.497 --> 00:21:58.483]  And their Secretary of State, their Prime Minister, they've all come out and said it's their Christian duty to fight against Satan slash Soros plan.
[00:22:00.131 --> 00:22:10.743]  And they are sending nationwide to all the homes documents and quotes by Soros admitting the plan to destroy Europe and turn it over to Islam.
[00:22:11.944 --> 00:22:14.247]  Now what have I said a thousand times and I'll say it again.
[00:22:14.267 --> 00:22:21.435]  If you have a private corporate above the law tax free world government that also backs authoritarianism.
[00:22:24.125 --> 00:22:26.146]  Once you expose it, it's dead.
[00:22:26.826 --> 00:22:28.987]  It may take a while to remove the face sucker.
[00:22:29.007 --> 00:22:31.107]  It may take a while to remove the parasite.
[00:22:31.927 --> 00:22:48.452]  But once you're aware that Hollywood's a parasite, once you're aware that George Soros is a parasite, and once you're aware that royalty is a parasite, and once you're aware of all these unelected, corrupt systems that we pay for and that we live under, it's over!
[00:22:49.473 --> 00:22:50.633]  It's worse than garbage.
[00:22:51.413 --> 00:22:53.554]  It's worse than something you take out to the curb.
[00:22:55.836 --> 00:22:58.538]  It's something you throw into the deepest pit of the ocean.
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:06.004]  So, I can tell you, historically and culturally, the tide isn't just going out on globalism.
[00:23:08.546 --> 00:23:11.569]  Globalism is a dead letter.
[00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.072]  Globalism is the plague.
[00:23:16.733 --> 00:23:18.334]  Globalism is a failure.
[00:23:18.554 --> 00:23:21.176]  And as bad as the death throes are,
[00:23:22.324 --> 00:23:28.649]  Of the Hollywood Combine, and the NFL, and the late-night talk shows, and so-called comedians reading off teleprompters.
[00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.970]  It's just that.
[00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:36.895]  Frothing, agonizing, melting away death throes.
[00:23:40.077 --> 00:23:40.538]  And that's it.
[00:23:42.239 --> 00:23:46.942]  And you've got to ask yourselves, what are they going to do to try to stop us?
[00:23:47.323 --> 00:23:48.484]  Well, they're going to try to start wars.
[00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:50.546]  They're going to try to start culture wars.
[00:23:50.566 --> 00:23:52.207]  They're going to try everything they can.
[00:23:53.207 --> 00:24:10.550]  But the giant Ponzi scheme that's mainstream media and the giant Ponzi scheme that's the Fortune 100 corporations that all dreamed of how they were building this great world government where they'd be gods in the Elysium fields and all us mere mortals would be down here not even aware of their global government.
[00:24:12.651 --> 00:24:13.271]  Well guess what?
[00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:14.191]  You miscalculated.
[00:24:15.865 --> 00:24:27.774]  You thought enough people would just go along with the New York Times and the ADL and Southern Primary Law Center and the Washington Post, beating people over the head, calling them all these names, if they didn't submit.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:41.725]  You thought you could bully us, but all you did was your hen pecking.
[00:24:43.533 --> 00:24:45.115]  Over and over, you're trying to keep us in line?
[00:24:45.675 --> 00:24:47.317]  You thought you had us intimidated and scared?
[00:24:48.779 --> 00:24:50.020]  Really, we were in a deep sleep.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.084]  It's like... You're trying to keep us in line?
[00:24:54.104 --> 00:24:55.385]  You thought you were so powerful?
[00:24:56.266 --> 00:24:57.748]  You thought you dominated us?
[00:24:58.208 --> 00:24:59.430]  And finally, we're like, what is that?
[00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:00.831]  Pecking on my head?
[00:25:02.733 --> 00:25:02.913]  Ugh!
[00:25:04.555 --> 00:25:05.776]  Some gremlin creature?
[00:25:06.854 --> 00:25:08.295]  How about I just break your neck?
[00:25:08.315 --> 00:25:09.095]  How's that feel?
[00:25:09.615 --> 00:25:10.936]  Now it's eyes are bugged out.
[00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.336]  It's arms and legs are scrabbling an arm.
[00:25:13.597 --> 00:25:14.517]  Got a few scratches.
[00:25:14.537 --> 00:25:21.880]  How about we just throw you into a... Throw you into a pit of hell.
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:23.300]  Bye-bye.
[00:25:25.161 --> 00:25:26.161]  Take all of it with you.
[00:25:26.422 --> 00:25:27.502]  Your red carpets.
[00:25:28.682 --> 00:25:31.103]  All your glitter bug, narcissism garbage.
[00:25:31.483 --> 00:25:32.664]  And go fall off a cliff.
[00:25:35.247 --> 00:25:39.851]  And break your neck down there politically, culturally, spiritually, like every other failed system in history.
[00:25:41.192 --> 00:25:54.284]  It is, ladies and gentlemen, a true time that tries humanity's souls on this Wednesday, October 11th, 2017 worldwide broadcast.
[00:25:55.345 --> 00:25:55.885]  And I'm your host.
[00:25:55.906 --> 00:26:00.490]  We're going to be live here for the next three and a half hours now that we have left in the broadcast.
[00:26:01.744 --> 00:26:03.245]  And let's just do something different today.
[00:26:04.245 --> 00:26:09.148]  I've got enough news and enough powerful clips to, wow, fill a whole day.
[00:26:09.168 --> 00:26:28.557]  And we'll get to a lot of it, but I really do want to, early on, take your calls, first-time callers, on the fall of Hollywood, the fall of the NFL, the fall of the Democratic Party, the beginning of the fall of the Republican establishment, and the fall of the EU, and the fall of the Islamic takeover, Arab Spring, and just
[00:26:30.836 --> 00:26:38.942]  The misfire, the backfire, that is globalism becoming uncloaked.
[00:26:40.643 --> 00:26:51.210]  And the really accelerated beginning of their cultural destruction.
[00:26:54.192 --> 00:26:56.894]  This has been the reign of the pedophile devil worshippers.
[00:26:58.155 --> 00:26:59.976]  And it doesn't mean it's going to end quickly.
[00:27:01.855 --> 00:27:06.479]  But while humanity slept, they weave their webs.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.661]  But the sun always comes back.
[00:27:11.923 --> 00:27:15.546]  And we're not just in the early morning hours now.
[00:27:16.006 --> 00:27:23.732]  The sun is starting to rise high into the sky and the night creatures are beginning to feel the heat.
[00:27:25.994 --> 00:27:30.918]  And when the sun rises to the high point,
[00:27:32.805 --> 00:27:36.889]  It will be the complete end of the age for the globalist.
[00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.211]  And that's where we are.
[00:27:39.231 --> 00:27:40.352]  And they know it.
[00:27:40.832 --> 00:27:41.332]  And they think A.I.
[00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:42.634]  is going to save them.
[00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:45.536]  And they think telling you they're invincible is going to save them.
[00:27:45.756 --> 00:27:47.077]  Because they all know they're losers.
[00:27:47.678 --> 00:27:48.719]  They all know they're fakes.
[00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:49.760]  They all know they're frauds.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.700]  They all know they're jokes.
[00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:53.863]  They all know no one really wants to be around them.
[00:27:54.143 --> 00:27:55.565]  And they've never had real love.
[00:27:55.905 --> 00:27:57.266]  And they'll never get real love.
[00:27:57.666 --> 00:28:00.329]  And so they want to destroy all that's good.
[00:28:01.889 --> 00:28:23.397]  When you hear these Harry Weinstein tapes and you hear all this other garbage and you hear the Brothers Defense and Harvey Weinstein, you realize that he's not wanting to have sex with these beautiful women or put them on a pedestal and make them have a good time.
[00:28:25.342 --> 00:28:32.808]  He is enjoying, as I predicted days ago, last week, before the tapes came out, because I just want to show folks what I'm talking about.
[00:28:33.348 --> 00:28:35.750]  We ought to find that.
[00:28:37.391 --> 00:28:42.375]  When I said, you see, it isn't the sex he wants, it's the power.
[00:28:43.896 --> 00:28:51.102]  And a minute, if you're going to make a gorgeous, smart woman sit there and watch you when you look like a diseased hippopotamus,
[00:28:53.593 --> 00:28:57.662]  Rub on yourself in a shower and watch you play with yourself.
[00:28:58.383 --> 00:29:00.588]  I mean that shows you how low these demons are.
[00:29:00.608 --> 00:29:04.556]  Now ladies and gentlemen we're running
[00:29:05.822 --> 00:29:11.146]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:29:11.406 --> 00:29:12.527]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:12.787 --> 00:29:15.089]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:29:15.749 --> 00:29:22.274]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:29:22.475 --> 00:29:25.817]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[00:29:26.117 --> 00:29:27.939]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:29:28.579 --> 00:29:36.989]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.970]  They know how great it is.
[00:29:38.891 --> 00:29:42.635]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:29:43.576 --> 00:29:44.977]  Tropic means for the brain.
[00:29:45.778 --> 00:29:53.643]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:29:54.083 --> 00:29:59.747]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[00:30:05.111 --> 00:30:05.531]  That comes to $50.03.
[00:30:05.692 --> 00:30:09.715]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:30:10.135 --> 00:30:13.278]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:30:13.318 --> 00:30:14.258]  It's a good deal at $39.
[00:30:15.459 --> 00:30:16.180]  It's $19.96 at Infowarslife.com.
[00:30:22.765 --> 00:30:27.368]  Or simply call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:30:27.508 --> 00:30:42.239]  And when you purchase Brain Force Plus, or any of the other great products like Secret 12, Caveman, Oxy Powder, Super Mel Vitality, our fluoride-free, super blue, colloidal silver, and iodine-empowered toothpaste, you get...
[00:30:43.496 --> 00:30:47.942]  To support the information war and get really high quality products.
[00:30:47.962 --> 00:30:51.026]  When you sign up for AutoShip, you always get 10% off.
[00:30:51.287 --> 00:30:56.273]  And there's free shipping at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:30:56.494 --> 00:30:58.436]  There's free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[00:30:59.938 --> 00:31:02.921]  Again, that's infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:03.181 --> 00:31:20.976]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[00:31:21.696 --> 00:31:27.020]  And we're not just going to have to end the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:36.227]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[00:31:36.787 --> 00:31:37.428]  Concentrate.
[00:31:37.448 --> 00:31:39.249]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:40.930]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:42.772]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:31:43.192 --> 00:31:44.053]  It's incredible.
[00:31:44.533 --> 00:31:46.454]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:31:46.635 --> 00:31:47.775]  It's bigger than I am already.
[00:31:48.236 --> 00:31:49.136]  At 15, incredible.
[00:31:49.457 --> 00:31:50.357]  It is amazing.
[00:31:50.698 --> 00:31:51.979]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:52.419 --> 00:31:53.540]  50% off Caveman.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.081]  But only a few days left.
[00:31:55.341 --> 00:31:56.082]  It's about to end.
[00:31:56.662 --> 00:31:59.004]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[00:31:59.464 --> 00:32:04.627]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[00:32:05.047 --> 00:32:06.428]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:32:06.688 --> 00:32:07.849]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:32:08.229 --> 00:32:09.050]  I want to thank you.
[00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:10.430]  We're all in this together.
[00:32:10.951 --> 00:32:20.837]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,
[00:32:21.577 --> 00:32:24.998]  On sale right now at Infowarslife.com, you're fighting the tip of the spear.
[00:32:25.238 --> 00:32:27.039]  But these specials have got to end.
[00:32:27.059 --> 00:32:36.982]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer BrainForce at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[00:32:37.242 --> 00:32:42.584]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.
[00:32:43.064 --> 00:32:47.706]  Again, visit Infowarsstore.com today and commit to helping the InfoWar.
[00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:55.990]  Funding the InfoWar is now more important than ever, and when you fund the InfoWar, you get incredible high-quality products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:32:56.350 --> 00:33:01.173]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus and 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[00:33:06.015 --> 00:33:08.676]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.078 --> 00:33:26.099]  Bandits only fired once.
[00:33:42.745 --> 00:33:46.449]  Bandits only fired once, they shot me in the chest.
[00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:52.435]  They may have wounded me, but they'll never get the best of better men.
[00:33:52.655 --> 00:33:54.537]  Welcome back folks, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:56.299 --> 00:34:00.863]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:34:01.404 --> 00:34:06.429]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:34:11.758 --> 00:34:19.176]  I'm gonna give the phone number out for first-time callers again today, so all of you can get involved on air with us on this Wednesday Global Transmission.
[00:34:19.997 --> 00:34:24.001]  The number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[00:34:24.021 --> 00:34:28.224]  877-789-A-L-E-X is the number to join us.
[00:34:28.885 --> 00:34:36.892]  We don't screen your calls other than you have a good phone line and that you're calling in and want to basically get on air.
[00:34:37.052 --> 00:34:42.537]  We'd like to know how you're listening if you'd like to volunteer that so we can plug some of our affiliates out there as well.
[00:34:43.277 --> 00:34:44.118]  But again, the number is 877-789-ALEX.
[00:34:48.323 --> 00:35:01.113]  I don't really have glee to see Hollywood and the NFL and the whole mentally ill media complex faltering, because I knew it was going to collapse.
[00:35:03.755 --> 00:35:17.046]  And I'm already basically so sick of looking at them and hearing from them, just like you are, that I almost don't want to begin doing a post-mortem review of their
[00:35:18.723 --> 00:35:19.043]  Body.
[00:35:19.864 --> 00:35:20.404]  Politic.
[00:35:21.425 --> 00:35:22.386]  But it's gotta be done.
[00:35:22.466 --> 00:35:45.283]  And see, the same reason I'm disgusted by them, and you're disgusted by them, just the same way I can't even play clips from all these History Channel and Discovery Channel and HBO and Comedy Central shows that lie about yours truly and make up things I never said,
[00:35:46.949 --> 00:35:54.059]  Because I just am so divorced from them, so separate that I can't even look at it to review it.
[00:35:56.102 --> 00:36:01.250]  And that's when you know you've really broken the back of the stalker.
[00:36:03.601 --> 00:36:12.028]  If you've ever had a stalker, as soon as you really don't care about them and just forgive them, but don't want to give it any attention, they just metaphysically pick up on it and go away.
[00:36:12.248 --> 00:36:14.489]  It's psychic vampire behavior.
[00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.231]  And you've got to understand, folks, this is the big truth.
[00:36:18.143 --> 00:36:39.214]  Hollywood, mainstream media, corporate systems are loser collections of scum that want to be in power, that want to be in charge, and want to control the great engine of America and our individualism and our entrepreneurship and our will.
[00:36:40.915 --> 00:36:46.998]  And so they've wanted to make the host weak and controllable while still exploiting it.
[00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:57.077]  But like fire, that spirit is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[00:36:58.198 --> 00:37:06.704]  To borrow a phrase from our first president, George Washington, he was saying government is like fire, a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[00:37:06.764 --> 00:37:06.944]  Yes.
[00:37:08.029 --> 00:37:19.437]  But when you've conquered freedom, when you believe you have your thumb on the people, on flyover country, on Christians, and you want to beat the hell out of them because you feel they're struggling away.
[00:37:19.457 --> 00:37:33.126]  You have to understand, people like Harvey Weinstein calling in these models, calling in these fawning women to put him up on a
[00:37:34.468 --> 00:37:41.591]  pedestal because they believed that they fawned and groveled to this dead possum on the side of the road.
[00:37:43.791 --> 00:37:44.892]  That's what the Satanist wants.
[00:37:44.912 --> 00:37:56.276]  That's what the ugly demon wants, spiritually ugly, is to have all these people fawning and all this beauty fawning at it so that it can make you think it's what is shining.
[00:37:58.524 --> 00:38:05.149]  That's why Satan is going to use up children, and torture children, and kill children, and destroy children's innocence.
[00:38:05.169 --> 00:38:10.954]  And if they can't do it to your child, if they can't get their hands on every child, how are they going to do it?
[00:38:10.994 --> 00:38:14.216]  They're going to do it medically through the vaccines that they know are lowering IQ.
[00:38:14.236 --> 00:38:17.419]  They're going to do it through the fluoride they admit is lowering IQ.
[00:38:17.479 --> 00:38:18.159]  It's all planned.
[00:38:18.179 --> 00:38:21.162]  They're going to do it through GMO they admit is destroying the genetics.
[00:38:21.182 --> 00:38:24.104]  They're going to do it through the culture of 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:38:25.475 --> 00:38:50.132]  Common Corp, and they're going to do it by sexualizing your children on Nickelodeon, that's an admitted plan, teaching your children about their twisted view of the human condition, because that's all they've got is soulless servants of Satan, of soulless servants of that archetype, even if they don't believe in the devil, they manifest it, so it's real.
[00:38:52.836 --> 00:39:03.823]  Because they are so incredibly desperate on their knees, and they know if you just go live a good, wholesome, happy life, that you'll be free of them.
[00:39:04.224 --> 00:39:07.646]  So like the spider, it wants to catch you in the web.
[00:39:10.548 --> 00:39:18.073]  So when you listen to Ambra Gutierrez of Filipino-Italian Beauty, when he's calling her in,
[00:39:20.802 --> 00:39:24.344]  He starts, at first he's demanding, later he's begging, he's begging, he goes, I do this all the time.
[00:39:24.784 --> 00:39:27.285]  I can't have you say no, I do this all the time.
[00:39:27.906 --> 00:39:33.128]  It has nothing to do with wanting to have sex with a woman, or love a woman, or be with a woman.
[00:39:33.228 --> 00:39:37.791]  It's all about dominating, controlling.
[00:39:37.831 --> 00:39:39.872]  And just to show you, I know the enemy.
[00:39:40.132 --> 00:39:45.715]  Just to show you, just last week I said it isn't about the sex with the women.
[00:39:47.398 --> 00:39:49.519]  Hell, just two days ago I said it before it broke.
[00:39:49.879 --> 00:39:55.563]  I said, that's why he's got two or three coming through a day and bringing them on these tours.
[00:39:57.204 --> 00:40:05.188]  And I said, notice they come out looking completely freaked out because, folks, these are the women that said no, that didn't go to the next steps.
[00:40:06.769 --> 00:40:13.413]  Let me tell you, he wants those women to feel humiliated and scared.
[00:40:13.953 --> 00:40:14.734]  Those are the ones that
[00:40:16.377 --> 00:40:19.338]  Pennywise, or Harvey Weinstein, wants.
[00:40:20.219 --> 00:40:22.059]  Because he can't feed on your energy.
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.261]  Unless you're repulsed.
[00:40:26.301 --> 00:40:28.802]  He doesn't want the women to have a great time.
[00:40:29.503 --> 00:40:31.324]  He doesn't want to empower women.
[00:40:31.684 --> 00:40:35.005]  He wants to squat on them, satanically.
[00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:39.487]  On the great energy God gave us through women.
[00:40:41.888 --> 00:40:43.389]  Foremost, except for children.
[00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.461]  And that's the fruit of the woman's womb.
[00:40:46.801 --> 00:40:53.683]  They want your children, the abortion, the partial birth, all of it is their sacrament.
[00:40:54.043 --> 00:41:08.428]  And when you listen to him dripping and slithering, and no, no, no, no, it's like the performance in the new It, when Pennywise is just a, like an anglerfish's light hung out front of the real spider behind it.
[00:41:09.268 --> 00:41:10.589]  When It can't scare you,
[00:41:12.091 --> 00:41:14.976]  It can't feed, because it's spiritual feeding.
[00:41:17.661 --> 00:41:21.147]  And then you understand the bullying of everybody by these people.
[00:41:21.207 --> 00:41:25.294]  That's all it is, is they want to run your mind.
[00:41:26.175 --> 00:41:27.676]  They want your soul.
[00:41:28.196 --> 00:41:30.017]  They want to feed off your fear.
[00:41:30.377 --> 00:41:38.740]  They want to have your children play video games that are designed to scramble their brains and give them permanent, basically electronic-induced autism.
[00:41:39.301 --> 00:41:54.387]  They want to disassociate everyone because these are truly, truly, truly, completely, and absolutely evil people turned over to the abyss.
[00:41:56.798 --> 00:42:00.479]  And of course she went to the NYPD, and they did nothing.
[00:42:02.199 --> 00:42:11.541]  You can do whatever you want, as long as you go along with the big banks and the globalists, and as long as you give political contributions.
[00:42:12.361 --> 00:42:19.723]  You think they just have reports of women where Weinstein tries to force women to watch him in a shower?
[00:42:21.523 --> 00:42:22.323]  You really think?
[00:42:25.564 --> 00:42:26.384]  You really think that?
[00:42:30.543 --> 00:42:32.464]  He's into the revulsion.
[00:42:34.826 --> 00:42:42.170]  See, there's something a lot sweeter than just, in his little spider brain, than degrading women, and we all know it.
[00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:44.432]  You can take one look at this man.
[00:42:45.832 --> 00:42:47.734]  You can take one look at Dennis Astrid.
[00:42:48.834 --> 00:42:53.937]  You can take one look at any of them, and they always have that same little piggy look in the eye.
[00:42:55.678 --> 00:42:57.980]  They always got the look.
[00:42:59.462 --> 00:43:01.843]  They always love their father, Satan.
[00:43:03.224 --> 00:43:11.369]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:15.312]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:43:15.992 --> 00:43:22.496]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:43:22.696 --> 00:43:26.038]  So I'm offering for the first time ever, 50% off.
[00:43:26.359 --> 00:43:28.160]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month,
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:37.210]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.211]  They know how great it is.
[00:43:39.132 --> 00:43:42.876]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:43:43.817 --> 00:43:45.218]  Tropic means for the brain.
[00:43:46.018 --> 00:43:53.881]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:43:54.321 --> 00:44:00.123]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[00:44:05.345 --> 00:44:05.765]  That comes to $50.03.
[00:44:06.006 --> 00:44:09.948]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:44:10.369 --> 00:44:13.511]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:44:13.551 --> 00:44:14.492]  It's a good deal at $39.
[00:44:15.693 --> 00:44:16.413]  It's $19.96 at Infowarslife.com.
[00:44:22.978 --> 00:44:28.400]  Or simply call toll-free, 888-253-3139.

[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:37.661]  Concentrate.
[00:45:37.681 --> 00:45:39.482]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:45:39.722 --> 00:45:41.163]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:45:41.383 --> 00:45:43.005]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:45:43.425 --> 00:45:44.286]  It's incredible.
[00:45:44.766 --> 00:45:46.687]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:45:46.868 --> 00:45:48.008]  It's bigger than I am already.
[00:45:48.469 --> 00:45:49.369]  At 15, incredible.

[00:46:08.462 --> 00:46:09.263]  I want to thank you.

[00:47:05.462 --> 00:47:08.064]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:35.225 --> 00:47:42.850]  We now take you live to the fall of the New World Order.
[00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:48.893]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:47:49.274 --> 00:47:54.437]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:47:54.517 --> 00:48:04.423]  Notice in the 50s and 60s and 70s, folks that were into so-called being radicals, acted like it was the devil and, you know, the devil was gonna jump.
[00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:10.832]  The buses with the motorcycle, and the devil was the astronaut, and the devil was the cowboy.
[00:48:11.233 --> 00:48:14.774]  No, no, the devil isn't a trailblazer, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:15.835 --> 00:48:18.876]  The devil swindles you and leaves you starving to death in the desert.
[00:48:19.496 --> 00:48:21.857]  The devil steals your soul, steals your will.
[00:48:22.237 --> 00:48:28.380]  The devil likes to grab kids out of their backyards and make them beg for mommy for a couple months till they give up.
[00:48:32.142 --> 00:48:32.503]  That's right.
[00:48:32.543 --> 00:48:35.288]  That's what psychopaths always want, is people giving up.
[00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:39.616]  Going through total horror, and then giving up.
[00:48:40.538 --> 00:48:41.740]  Giving up on God.
[00:48:43.022 --> 00:48:44.325]  Surrendering to evil.
[00:48:46.857 --> 00:48:58.627]  That's the liqueur, that's the melange, that's the spice, that's the essence, that's the very blood that they're looking for.
[00:48:58.968 --> 00:49:05.473]  So understand, Harvey Weinstein or his vampire wife, let's put this vampire on television, Ms.
[00:49:05.553 --> 00:49:08.296]  Chapman, Ms.
[00:49:08.396 --> 00:49:11.879]  Chapman, I mean another plastic, rubber, nothing.
[00:49:14.019 --> 00:49:23.384]  That is just the front person for him to be the married man with two children and she had no idea what was going on.
[00:49:24.425 --> 00:49:25.866]  The poor lady.
[00:49:26.206 --> 00:49:28.027]  What if we looked perfect like her?
[00:49:28.507 --> 00:49:30.749]  Wouldn't it be amazing?
[00:49:32.029 --> 00:49:34.651]  Can you imagine how soulless that woman is?
[00:49:35.591 --> 00:49:39.614]  Going to climb into bed with that circus clown?
[00:49:41.678 --> 00:49:43.420]  Harvey Weinstein.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:51.566]  And the big joke in Hollywood was about how everybody's got to sleep with Harvey if you want to be in the movies.
[00:49:52.367 --> 00:49:56.811]  And then, if he did anything bad, well, if he didn't submit, he'd come after you.
[00:49:56.871 --> 00:50:03.376]  And so would Matt Damon, the big virtue signaler that says we should all take refugees in but doesn't take one.
[00:50:03.496 --> 00:50:05.098]  Or Ben Affleck.
[00:50:06.809 --> 00:50:07.830]  Or any of these other people.
[00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:13.293]  I mean, it's gone from, I'd halfway watch a movie, to now I can't watch any of them.
[00:50:14.474 --> 00:50:15.395]  None of the new movies.
[00:50:16.035 --> 00:50:17.316]  I gotta go watch old classics.
[00:50:17.556 --> 00:50:22.200]  Because they had their own problems, but they weren't just weaponized evil.
[00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:35.709]  Now, Matt's put together a powerful video we're gonna air next hour if we take calls, of Hollywood making jokes about Weinstein in the past, and grudgereport.com is linked to one of Paul Watson's articles breaking all this down.
[00:50:38.029 --> 00:50:41.874]  And we should upload the video you did, Matt, without my commentary and just add it to that Drugs Report article.
[00:50:42.495 --> 00:50:43.156]  Good compilation.
[00:50:43.176 --> 00:50:46.800]  But let's play Weinstein, the head of Miramax.
[00:50:48.041 --> 00:50:50.802]  Notice, to all minimize danger, it's all a big PR deal.
[00:50:51.323 --> 00:50:56.846]  Like, oh, first they fired him so they could separate their money from all the lawsuits, and then, oh, she's leaving.
[00:50:56.886 --> 00:51:00.107]  It's all rolled out in a PR fashion.
[00:51:00.127 --> 00:51:03.809]  And that's exactly what I thought this morning when I saw her leaving him.
[00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:06.811]  And I was talking to Zach, one of the producers in there, about what he thought.
[00:51:06.831 --> 00:51:10.213]  He just said, oh, it was all just laid out systematically.
[00:51:10.613 --> 00:51:12.114]  See how we see the exact same thing?
[00:51:12.314 --> 00:51:13.274]  Because it's the truth.
[00:51:13.935 --> 00:51:16.176]  And so now it's just revolting!
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.061]  It's so uncool to be into Hollywood.
[00:51:22.341 --> 00:51:24.561]  It's so uncool to like their dumb movies.
[00:51:24.862 --> 00:51:26.882]  It's so uncool to be into the NFL.
[00:51:30.523 --> 00:51:31.663]  You know what's more popular than ever?
[00:51:32.004 --> 00:51:32.424]  Wrestling.
[00:51:32.644 --> 00:51:35.965]  Because it's right-wing, it's stupid, it's ridiculous.
[00:51:36.345 --> 00:51:37.905]  Everyone's making fun of each other.
[00:51:38.185 --> 00:51:40.366]  It's completely fake and everybody admits it.
[00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:50.256]  People want genuine, and if it's fake, they want completely fake, and completely absurd, and completely stupid, like Japanese television.
[00:51:52.578 --> 00:51:58.583]  If I want diversions, I want complete idiocy, with nothing political involved!
[00:51:59.043 --> 00:51:59.584]  I love it!
[00:52:00.625 --> 00:52:01.886]  I crave it when I can find it!
[00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:05.569]  Just agenda-free comedy!
[00:52:05.669 --> 00:52:06.690]  Give it to me right now!
[00:52:07.975 --> 00:52:15.676]  Instead of all this weaponized comedy, even though it's killing all their ratings and killing the NFL and killing Hollywood, they can't stop!
[00:52:16.497 --> 00:52:27.558]  Just like Harvey Weinstein, up to three women a day, he wanted to do weird stuff in front of to horrify them, because whatever demon it is that lives in him gets off on just grossing women out.
[00:52:27.879 --> 00:52:35.440]  You know, we ought to be thankful that's all we know Mr. Hare Weinstein's in, but we all know you don't get to the top of Hollywood.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.000]  So I've talked to folks high up in it.
[00:52:42.321 --> 00:52:43.322]  Like, it's just a formality.
[00:52:43.402 --> 00:52:45.282]  Just say you hate Jesus Christ, you love Satan.
[00:52:46.102 --> 00:52:48.963]  And then whenever people say no, they go, oh, we just do that to get Christians out of the room.
[00:52:49.323 --> 00:52:50.063]  It's just a joke.
[00:52:50.083 --> 00:52:51.124]  We don't really believe in God.
[00:52:51.144 --> 00:52:54.844]  And then later you find out.
[00:52:58.225 --> 00:52:59.206]  Later you find out.
[00:53:01.886 --> 00:53:04.907]  Hey, Alex, you better get out of this party unless you like screwing kids.
[00:53:06.271 --> 00:53:06.731]  Excuse me?
[00:53:08.012 --> 00:53:10.995]  Oh, I'm just joking, but you better go if you don't like that kind of stuff.
[00:53:14.537 --> 00:53:19.481]  And I never even got very deep into Hollywood, and I had comments like that made.
[00:53:19.741 --> 00:53:22.063]  And these were parties with some of the top names at them.
[00:53:23.564 --> 00:53:26.647]  And you see, folks, you can sell a service without somebody wanting to get rid of you.
[00:53:27.087 --> 00:53:27.688]  Exactly.
[00:53:28.916 --> 00:53:38.141]  Because see, there might not have been that coming up at that party that night, but that's the spirit, that's the test, that's the stuff that goes on over and over.
[00:53:38.181 --> 00:53:42.044]  You want to be around the power, the money, the women throwing themselves at you?
[00:53:42.264 --> 00:53:43.364]  That's just the lures.
[00:53:44.705 --> 00:53:50.948]  To get men and women watching like, oh, the pretty people are there, because right behind it is the big old anglerfish.
[00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:53.629]  Can we put an anglerfish on screen for TV viewers?
[00:53:53.909 --> 00:54:03.734]  You know, they're the deep sea, 10,000, 15,000 foot deep, big old black, blue spotted things that look scarier than Geiger, H.R.
[00:54:03.774 --> 00:54:06.375]  Geiger's aliens with those big old crystalline teeth.
[00:54:07.196 --> 00:54:08.376]  Yeah, that's an artist's rendering.
[00:54:08.396 --> 00:54:09.557]  Let's look at a real one.
[00:54:10.546 --> 00:54:19.854]  And they got a nice little pretty light bulb, a phosphorescent bulb out front, so other little fishies think there might be something to eat.
[00:54:20.434 --> 00:54:22.136]  And they come over, that's all Hollywood.
[00:54:22.416 --> 00:54:23.597]  See the pretty girl?
[00:54:24.038 --> 00:54:24.698]  There's a real one.
[00:54:25.639 --> 00:54:26.059]  Yeah.
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.181]  See the pretty people?
[00:54:29.042 --> 00:54:29.883]  You like them?
[00:54:30.643 --> 00:54:33.145]  Come closer in the dark!
[00:54:34.006 --> 00:54:35.647]  Come closer!
[00:54:39.127 --> 00:54:45.009]  Here, let's go out to break listening to the evil, dark waters of just the anglerfish.
[00:54:45.809 --> 00:54:47.269]  This is just surface feeding.
[00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:53.711]  Ruining women's innocence, dashing their dreams, getting off on them being defiled.
[00:54:53.731 --> 00:54:57.392]  Because it's not as good as a child, but it'll do for a snack.
[00:54:57.892 --> 00:55:00.553]  Let's hear Weinstein feeding.
[00:55:04.386 --> 00:55:05.809]  What do we have to do here?
[00:55:05.829 --> 00:55:06.070]  Nothing.
[00:55:06.350 --> 00:55:09.416]  I'm going to take a shower and you sit there and have a drink.
[00:55:09.477 --> 00:55:10.098]  Don't drink.
[00:55:10.198 --> 00:55:11.601]  Can I stay on the bar?
[00:55:11.701 --> 00:55:11.901]  No.
[00:55:12.022 --> 00:55:13.144]  You must come here now.
[00:55:13.244 --> 00:55:13.505]  No.
[00:55:14.551 --> 00:55:14.691]  Please.
[00:55:14.751 --> 00:55:15.712]  I don't want to.
[00:55:15.732 --> 00:55:17.273]  I'm not doing anything with you.
[00:55:17.394 --> 00:55:18.194]  I don't want to.
[00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:19.015]  I'm sorry.
[00:55:19.155 --> 00:55:20.616]  I don't want to.
[00:55:20.696 --> 00:55:23.119]  Yesterday was kind of aggressive for me.
[00:55:23.359 --> 00:55:24.500]  I need to know a person.
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:25.741]  I won't do a thing.
[00:55:25.761 --> 00:55:26.141]  I won't.
[00:55:26.161 --> 00:55:27.422]  I won't do a thing, please.
[00:55:27.543 --> 00:55:28.323]  I swear I won't.
[00:55:28.403 --> 00:55:29.084]  Just sit with me.
[00:55:29.124 --> 00:55:30.285]  Don't embarrass me in the hotel.
[00:55:30.305 --> 00:55:31.286]  I'm here all the time.
[00:55:31.446 --> 00:55:33.047]  I know, but I don't want to.
[00:55:33.087 --> 00:55:34.088]  Please sit there.
[00:55:34.268 --> 00:55:34.729]  Please.
[00:55:35.129 --> 00:55:35.630]  One minute.
[00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:36.230]  No, I can't.
[00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:36.931]  Go to the bathroom.
[00:55:36.951 --> 00:55:40.073]  Please, I don't want to do something I don't want to do.
[00:55:40.313 --> 00:55:40.614]  Come here.
[00:55:40.774 --> 00:55:41.294]  Listen to me.
[00:55:41.314 --> 00:55:42.375]  I want to go downstairs.
[00:55:42.395 --> 00:55:43.616]  I'm not going to do anything.
[00:55:43.716 --> 00:55:45.798]  You'll never see me again after this.
[00:55:45.918 --> 00:55:46.318]  Okay?
[00:55:46.418 --> 00:55:46.759]  That's it.
[00:55:46.799 --> 00:55:49.561]  If you embarrass me in this hotel... I'm not embarrassing you.
[00:55:49.661 --> 00:55:51.503]  It's just that I don't feel comfortable.
[00:55:51.583 --> 00:55:53.584]  I mean, don't have a fight with me in the hall.
[00:55:53.604 --> 00:55:54.085]  It's not nice.
[00:55:54.125 --> 00:55:55.526]  Please, I'm not going to do anything.
[00:55:55.586 --> 00:55:56.827]  I swear on my children.
[00:55:56.987 --> 00:55:57.748]  Please come in.
[00:55:58.008 --> 00:55:58.628]  On everything.
[00:55:58.648 --> 00:55:59.449]  I'm a famous guy.
[00:55:59.549 --> 00:56:01.631]  I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now.
[00:56:01.651 --> 00:56:02.632]  Please come in now.
[00:56:03.532 --> 00:56:14.954]  Just stick your hand in this drainage ditch and we bite it off.
[00:56:16.074 --> 00:56:17.034]  That's enough, stop right there.
[00:56:17.074 --> 00:56:20.135]  See, they metaphysically have to get you to come into the room.
[00:56:20.735 --> 00:56:22.415]  I'm gonna do something creepy, it's gonna be bad.
[00:56:23.055 --> 00:56:24.296]  But just come in, it's gonna be alright.
[00:56:24.356 --> 00:56:26.356]  And it's a lot creepier once you get in.
[00:56:26.816 --> 00:56:29.536]  You stick your arm in, he's gonna bite it off.
[00:56:30.197 --> 00:56:32.317]  And he's gonna make movies about how he does it.
[00:56:33.464 --> 00:56:35.585]  And he's going to star up there and watch himself.
[00:56:37.725 --> 00:56:39.746]  They're a bunch of clowns, let me tell you.
[00:56:39.766 --> 00:56:41.407]  That's why folks don't like them.
[00:56:44.728 --> 00:56:46.949]  They want to clown around, I'm ready to clown around with them.
[00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:52.690]  We're going to take these people down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:52.991 --> 00:56:54.451]  But we need the funding and the support.
[00:56:54.471 --> 00:56:55.992]  We need you to understand this is a total war.
[00:56:56.352 --> 00:56:57.852]  Spread the links, the articles, the videos.
[00:56:58.232 --> 00:57:02.774]  I ran into two women yesterday out taking care of errands that looked up from their phones
[00:57:03.988 --> 00:57:05.629]  Separate women listening to the show.
[00:57:07.129 --> 00:57:08.009]  Just going around town.
[00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:08.610]  I'm not bragging.
[00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:10.090]  It shows the power of Infowar.
[00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:13.872]  And in both times, I didn't even know what apps they were listening to us on.
[00:57:13.892 --> 00:57:14.772]  Didn't even recognize it.
[00:57:15.112 --> 00:57:15.792]  It's beautiful.
[00:57:16.032 --> 00:57:16.873]  Keep spreading the word.
[00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:17.773]  It's changing the world.
[00:57:18.093 --> 00:57:21.414]  And we got 50% off on Brain Force, our new tropic.
[00:57:21.454 --> 00:57:24.175]  That special is going to end very, very soon.
[00:57:24.195 --> 00:57:25.195]  A lot of other specials.
[00:57:25.476 --> 00:57:27.616]  There's a new special, Super Combo.
[00:57:27.636 --> 00:57:28.597]  Get Survival Shield X2.
[00:57:29.637 --> 00:57:30.157]  We're good to go.
[00:57:52.501 --> 00:57:56.345]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:56.385 --> 00:57:58.246]  We are under constant attack.
[00:57:58.707 --> 00:58:00.929]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:58:01.129 --> 00:58:04.032]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[00:58:04.072 --> 00:58:18.385]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:58:19.085 --> 00:58:20.705]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:58:21.085 --> 00:58:23.906]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:58:23.926 --> 00:58:24.906]  They don't have that power.
[00:58:25.366 --> 00:58:27.907]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:58:28.247 --> 00:58:30.668]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:58:31.108 --> 00:58:33.948]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:33.968 --> 00:58:35.609]  This is by listener request.
[00:58:35.849 --> 00:58:41.090]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:41.690]  Again,
[00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:48.173]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:58:48.593 --> 00:58:52.916]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:57.298]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:58:59.359 --> 00:59:02.082]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from Oz?
[00:59:02.102 --> 00:59:20.522]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:59:20.842 --> 00:59:23.664]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[00:59:23.704 --> 00:59:25.725]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:59:26.085 --> 00:59:28.087]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:59:28.547 --> 00:59:40.154]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:59:40.194 --> 00:59:44.037]  So support us by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:54.833 --> 01:00:00.797]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.585 --> 01:00:19.268]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.096 --> 01:00:34.541]  Don Salazar just gave me just ultra bombshell information.
[01:00:34.561 --> 01:00:38.984]  I used to say ultra bombshell every two years, now I say it every week.
[01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:43.887]  Because it's just, the whole house of cards is coming down.
[01:00:46.068 --> 01:00:49.711]  And just politically, culturally, spiritually though.
[01:00:51.092 --> 01:00:58.314]  Going into this territory up against these people, they see InfoWars as a figurehead in the fight for human awakening, because we are.
[01:00:58.334 --> 01:01:08.016]  A fulcrum, a focal point, a rallying point, a standard, a signet, a logo, a symbol.
[01:01:11.497 --> 01:01:13.657]  But I don't even know how to respond to what I was just given.
[01:01:13.677 --> 01:01:15.538]  This is not for dramatics.
[01:01:15.758 --> 01:01:17.278]  I got to take a break at this point.
[01:01:23.922 --> 01:01:26.762]  People would think being proven absolutely right is fun.
[01:01:26.822 --> 01:01:27.243]  It's not.
[01:01:33.284 --> 01:01:36.484]  Because I wish we were wrong.
[01:01:37.764 --> 01:01:38.705]  There it is, folks.
[01:01:39.805 --> 01:01:41.565]  You put together all the other information.
[01:01:41.665 --> 01:01:42.825]  It just is devastating.
[01:01:44.405 --> 01:01:45.446]  Mandalay Bay owner.
[01:01:46.386 --> 01:01:48.746]  What's being expressed by police may not be accurate.
[01:01:49.466 --> 01:01:53.007]  We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been complete.
[01:01:53.905 --> 01:01:54.887]  Communicated publicly.
[01:01:55.408 --> 01:01:57.452]  And that's because they changed the timeline, the official story.
[01:01:57.472 --> 01:01:58.413]  There are multiple shooters.
[01:01:58.434 --> 01:01:59.856]  There are shooters all over town.
[01:02:00.618 --> 01:02:02.782]  The police wiped out some of the terrorist cells.
[01:02:03.383 --> 01:02:06.088]  And I don't know why Trump's covering up the fact it was an Islamic attack.
[01:02:06.268 --> 01:02:06.549]  Thank you.
[01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:13.881]  Las Vegas shooting, timeline changes, raises questions about hotel security, police response.
[01:02:14.441 --> 01:02:19.604]  Newsweek, if ISIS was behind the Las Vegas attack, there's a terrifying reason why it hasn't proven it.
[01:02:20.045 --> 01:02:25.008]  Everything I told you day one, here we are day 11, it's all coming out.
[01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:38.136]  And by the way, you know, people think it's cool to have the FBI call up and say, Alex, we're interested, why do you say they'd attack at 10 o'clock at night?
[01:02:40.247 --> 01:02:41.948]  And you don't even have a real answer for it.
[01:02:41.968 --> 01:02:45.070]  And the FBI's like, yeah, that's real interesting.
[01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:47.091]  No, I'm not involved, so.
[01:02:48.192 --> 01:02:48.732]  I'm fighting it.
[01:02:48.952 --> 01:02:51.594]  I mean, the Democrats say they're going to start killing everybody October 1st.
[01:02:51.794 --> 01:02:53.055]  The full attack's November 4th.
[01:02:53.375 --> 01:02:59.138]  I figure they'll attack large crowds around 10 o'clock at night when they're at maximum density and there's police shifts going on.
[01:02:59.158 --> 01:03:00.259]  I mean, I don't know why.
[01:03:00.279 --> 01:03:03.601]  I just come up with my research and then I tell you my best estimation.
[01:03:06.723 --> 01:03:07.964]  And I don't have a crystal ball.
[01:03:08.922 --> 01:03:11.343]  But it's a little more than just analysis.
[01:03:12.524 --> 01:03:19.928]  And I mean I said earlier in the week that Weinstein guaranteed like to humiliate women.
[01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:22.030]  Now that's what they're all like in Hollywood.
[01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:23.070]  It's not a crystal ball.
[01:03:25.451 --> 01:03:27.172]  It's like once you realize these types.
[01:03:27.753 --> 01:03:31.275]  I used to read a lot of historical books when I was a teenager.
[01:03:32.295 --> 01:03:32.776]  And I read some
[01:03:34.093 --> 01:03:39.055]  Criminology books, not just Pulp Fiction, but some serious ones about how the police obsessed it on profiling.
[01:03:39.636 --> 01:03:41.797]  And I used to think, oh, people are more diverse than that.
[01:03:41.837 --> 01:03:46.379]  There's no way, because nice people are diverse in the things they do.
[01:03:46.759 --> 01:03:48.500]  Not criminals, psychopaths, and others.
[01:03:49.795 --> 01:03:51.175]  Maybe 15 different types?
[01:03:51.916 --> 01:04:05.179]  And man, you just learn the groups, the types, and it's like, how a wild hog acts, how a white-tailed deer acts, how a puma acts, how a moose acts, you know, how a squirrel acts, how a buzzard acts, how a fox acts.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:07.780]  And you just, well, you learn how.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:13.081]  How a, how a Hollywood executive pedophile devil worshiper acts.
[01:04:14.962 --> 01:04:17.342]  Because see, they want to humiliate children and innocents.
[01:04:17.382 --> 01:04:19.063]  Well, young beautiful women,
[01:04:21.667 --> 01:04:23.328]  It's not about putting them on a pedestal.
[01:04:23.388 --> 01:04:28.450]  It's about, you know, using the bathroom on the floor and making them eat it.
[01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:31.451]  Oh, you want that star and roll?
[01:04:31.871 --> 01:04:32.991]  You want 20 million?
[01:04:33.071 --> 01:04:34.312]  Call me God.
[01:04:35.052 --> 01:04:35.932]  Get on the ground.
[01:04:35.952 --> 01:04:38.853]  And call that God.
[01:04:39.654 --> 01:04:41.074]  I'm Harvey Weinstein.
[01:04:41.815 --> 01:04:43.775]  You're not just gonna worship me.
[01:04:44.355 --> 01:04:46.756]  You're gonna worship what I do on the ground.
[01:04:47.397 --> 01:04:48.257]  You understand?
[01:04:48.717 --> 01:04:49.177]  Listen.
[01:04:49.858 --> 01:04:50.258]  Listen!

[01:06:15.151 --> 01:06:19.301]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:06:20.003 --> 01:06:21.487]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:35.287 --> 01:06:37.449]  Hashtag Hollywood is dead.
[01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:42.213]  Daria, one of our great crew members and producers, just had that idea.
[01:06:42.233 --> 01:06:43.635]  She just sent that out on her Twitter.
[01:06:43.655 --> 01:06:45.756]  I'm going to retweet it here in a few minutes.
[01:06:46.277 --> 01:06:47.698]  At real Alex Jones.
[01:06:48.619 --> 01:06:53.784]  And so when you write articles or you post blurbs or you do graphics, hashtag Hollywood is dead.
[01:06:55.222 --> 01:06:59.910]  And I was thinking last night, Mike Cernovich texted me and he said, you know, you did your Bill Clinton's a rapist meme.
[01:07:00.571 --> 01:07:08.123]  You paid out about $200,000 in prizes to folks that confronted Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[01:07:09.397 --> 01:07:29.222]  Now with the fact that he is a known rapist who settled rape cases, Bill Clinton's a rapist, became really one of the main slogans of the campaign and devastated the enemy, just like Hillary for prison and lock her up, were progenerated by the Information Warfare Facility right here in the ATX, and that means facilitated by you, the listener, you, the watcher.
[01:07:29.642 --> 01:07:30.863]  You are the resistance.
[01:07:32.643 --> 01:07:36.084]  So, Daria put out, soulless servants of Satan.
[01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:39.291]  Hashtag Hollywood is dead.
[01:07:39.911 --> 01:07:41.151]  Don't you love Meathead?
[01:07:42.552 --> 01:07:43.492]  Rob Reiner?
[01:07:45.573 --> 01:07:46.153]  Meathead.
[01:07:47.653 --> 01:07:51.695]  Coming out a few weeks ago with his stupid Morgan Friedman video going.
[01:07:52.679 --> 01:07:54.240]  We are at war with Russia.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.481]  They have attacked us.
[01:07:55.561 --> 01:07:57.082]  I can't do a good Morgan Freeman imitation.
[01:07:57.763 --> 01:08:02.967]  But just all of the same fake gravity and gravitas.
[01:08:03.047 --> 01:08:04.648]  And it happened.
[01:08:04.688 --> 01:08:06.289]  The Russians stole it.
[01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:07.450]  Trump didn't get in.
[01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:08.370]  No, no.
[01:08:08.691 --> 01:08:09.852]  And people keep asking me,
[01:08:10.492 --> 01:08:11.173]  Like my children.
[01:08:11.273 --> 01:08:14.676]  They go, if everyone hates Trump so much, why did he get elected?
[01:08:15.156 --> 01:08:22.483]  And I said to my oldest daughter yesterday, I said, 13-year-old sweetheart, I said, sweetheart, that's the old corporate media.
[01:08:23.023 --> 01:08:24.564]  I said, do you watch Jimmy Kimmel?
[01:08:24.745 --> 01:08:25.065]  No.
[01:08:25.145 --> 01:08:25.685]  Who's that?
[01:08:26.286 --> 01:08:28.748]  Do you watch CNN?
[01:08:28.808 --> 01:08:29.088]  No.
[01:08:29.108 --> 01:08:32.351]  I mean, do you watch any of that?
[01:08:33.392 --> 01:08:33.752]  She goes, no.
[01:08:33.793 --> 01:08:34.653]  I go, what do you watch?
[01:08:35.894 --> 01:08:37.356]  She goes, well, you.
[01:08:38.854 --> 01:08:40.636]  And I said, who do people watch at your school?
[01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:41.356]  Well, you!
[01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:52.606]  I mean, I go to her school, and this isn't about me bragging, but, like, every grade, and then across the street, the high schoolers see me, and it's like, it's Alex Jones!
[01:08:52.646 --> 01:08:57.451]  And I don't want to do this on camera, because Hollywood stages stuff where people run up with paparazzi.
[01:08:57.611 --> 01:08:58.451]  That started in the 20s.
[01:08:58.471 --> 01:09:02.035]  They would stage cameras and newspapers there to make it look like they were news.
[01:09:03.393 --> 01:09:04.794]  To get other news to pile on.
[01:09:05.154 --> 01:09:14.421]  But I can literally go out and walk in front of a high school in Austin when it lets out, and I will be mobbed with people wanting photos and autographs and people, I was just listening to you!
[01:09:14.681 --> 01:09:17.783]  They're not watching Angelina Jolie or Morgan Freedman.
[01:09:18.103 --> 01:09:20.044]  And again, I'm not even bragging!
[01:09:25.968 --> 01:09:30.512]  It's court-ordered that I go to psychology meetings every two weeks.
[01:09:31.804 --> 01:09:34.126]  Uh, with my, um, daughters.
[01:09:34.146 --> 01:09:35.487]  I mean, I don't have to go, but they go.
[01:09:35.707 --> 01:09:38.229]  And it's turned out okay overall.
[01:09:38.490 --> 01:09:39.370]  I had a contested divorce.
[01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:41.352]  That's part of the system, and that's what happened.
[01:09:42.513 --> 01:09:43.294]  But, I mean, here's an example.
[01:09:43.354 --> 01:09:45.756]  I walk into the psychology place yesterday at 4 o'clock.
[01:09:46.877 --> 01:09:48.158]  There's a family walking out.
[01:09:49.431 --> 01:09:50.751]  of some of the other psychology offices.
[01:09:51.031 --> 01:09:51.911]  He shakes my hand.
[01:09:52.172 --> 01:09:53.852]  He's got a young daughter and a son.
[01:09:54.372 --> 01:09:55.172]  Hey, I loved the show.
[01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:55.972]  Just listened the other day.
[01:09:56.232 --> 01:09:56.812]  Loved David Knott.
[01:09:56.872 --> 01:09:57.413]  Okay, thanks.
[01:09:57.593 --> 01:09:58.133]  Appreciate it.
[01:09:58.913 --> 01:09:59.653]  I go sit down.
[01:10:00.213 --> 01:10:01.653]  My daughters are inside for an hour.
[01:10:02.373 --> 01:10:07.875]  Before they're about to come out, a 15-year-old girl comes in, sits down.
[01:10:07.895 --> 01:10:09.815]  I don't say anything to her because she's unaccompanied.
[01:10:09.835 --> 01:10:15.156]  I'm sitting there waiting on my daughters, playing on the phone, sending texts, doing news, researching.
[01:10:16.263 --> 01:10:17.123]  And then her mom walks in.
[01:10:17.963 --> 01:10:23.345]  And she looks at me, she looks at her phone, she goes, I'm listening to Owen Schroer right now on this app.
[01:10:23.365 --> 01:10:24.485]  And it's some app I've never seen.
[01:10:24.505 --> 01:10:26.405]  It's like a Blue Impulse or Square.
[01:10:26.425 --> 01:10:27.205]  She goes, it's incredible.
[01:10:27.726 --> 01:10:29.586]  And she said, you know, all my neighbors are listening now.
[01:10:29.646 --> 01:10:30.246]  It's amazing.
[01:10:31.046 --> 01:10:32.947]  Again, I'm not bragging, folks.
[01:10:33.907 --> 01:10:35.787]  I'm just saying they know they're dead.
[01:10:35.887 --> 01:10:39.808]  And I'm not saying we're the future, or we're cool, or we've got red carpets.
[01:10:40.128 --> 01:10:41.329]  That's all stupid.
[01:10:42.329 --> 01:10:43.149]  The point is,
[01:10:44.864 --> 01:10:46.045]  They are the past.
[01:10:46.205 --> 01:10:47.626]  They know they've collapsed.
[01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:48.947]  They know they're a joke.
[01:10:50.328 --> 01:10:51.148]  But let me tell you something.
[01:10:51.268 --> 01:10:57.972]  The radio executives, who are great guys in many cases, they're old-line conservatives, a lot of them, they don't know that their grandkids are listening.
[01:10:59.713 --> 01:11:00.454]  If you're Trump,
[01:11:01.676 --> 01:11:11.000]  Or you're these folks, you know new media is bigger than mainstream media, but still what you read is the New York Times, and so that still is what matters to you.
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:12.861]  But that's almost over, folks.
[01:11:13.121 --> 01:11:14.621]  That generation's almost gone.
[01:11:15.122 --> 01:11:17.563]  And they're great people, I'm not glad to say it.
[01:11:19.143 --> 01:11:27.487]  But the statistics show what I just told you, and it's not just that some of my children go to one particular school so they watch and listen there.
[01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:35.930]  Young people, when they see me at the mall or wherever, literally their mouths hang open and they go, it's the living meme!
[01:11:37.191 --> 01:11:50.781]  Trendies, old people, black folks, Hispanics, executive class Hispanics, Hispanic guys, you know, five guys walking through at the mall with gold chains all around their neck, it's Alex Jones, we love you so much!
[01:11:51.061 --> 01:11:52.542]  It doesn't matter, it's all groups!
[01:11:53.082 --> 01:11:56.004]  Because they know this is as close to reality as you're gonna get.
[01:11:56.244 --> 01:11:57.885]  We're really trying to find the truth!
[01:11:58.823 --> 01:12:01.784]  That's why they call us racist all day, because everybody loves us!
[01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:03.624]  People aren't stupid!
[01:12:06.645 --> 01:12:08.826]  So when I tell you all this, it's not bragging.
[01:12:10.286 --> 01:12:18.229]  It's so you understand when you're not a media person, and you're alone, and you wear a Trump shirt or an Infowars shirt, and somebody tries to throw coffee on you,
[01:12:19.838 --> 01:12:26.919]  Well, that's one out of twenty people that walk by you, and they're down so desperate knowing their evil control of society is over.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.800]  They're in on the game, man.
[01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:34.861]  That's why they almost all look like goblins or trolls or are always into weird, sick stuff.
[01:12:34.881 --> 01:12:37.042]  They want to pull down civilization.
[01:12:37.722 --> 01:12:43.523]  Weinstein wants women to come in, watch him get naked, get in the shower, make supermodels, watch this disgusting guy.
[01:12:44.463 --> 01:12:48.104]  And then now that they submit to that degradation, well now the relationship continues.
[01:12:48.344 --> 01:12:49.544]  That's how he tests you out.
[01:12:49.984 --> 01:12:52.445]  And it gets real nasty, real gross, real fast.
[01:12:54.706 --> 01:12:55.726]  That's what Hollywood is.
[01:12:56.286 --> 01:12:57.606]  Making you watch.
[01:12:57.927 --> 01:13:01.747]  Making your children watch Harvey Weinstein take a shower.
[01:13:03.528 --> 01:13:05.088]  It's an act of domination.
[01:13:05.488 --> 01:13:06.729]  An act of control.
[01:13:07.269 --> 01:13:11.150]  Lyndon Baines Johnson, this is on record, and Pulitzer Prize winning books,
[01:13:12.568 --> 01:13:21.217]  Would hold cabinet meetings while he took extended, incredibly stench-filled dumps.
[01:13:23.299 --> 01:13:25.141]  And he did it to dominate people.
[01:13:26.082 --> 01:13:27.524]  He did it to break them.
[01:13:28.635 --> 01:13:38.281]  And that's all Hollywood is and the NFL and Kaepernick and all these super uncool people like LeBron James and Eminem all getting together and you know the same headline everywhere.
[01:13:38.521 --> 01:13:39.482]  A fierce attack!
[01:13:39.542 --> 01:13:41.903]  I saw it in just headlines everywhere.
[01:13:41.943 --> 01:13:43.725]  A fierce attack by Eminem.
[01:13:44.065 --> 01:13:49.768]  Just some pathetic corporate shill with LeBron James and the dumb zombies that still think it's cool.
[01:13:50.129 --> 01:13:55.292]  Yeah, there's still a big component of schmucks that go spend their money on that and think it's all cool.
[01:13:57.841 --> 01:13:59.361]  But it's not the young people anymore.
[01:14:00.661 --> 01:14:05.842]  They're like, Dad, I don't want to go see a Harrison Ford movie.
[01:14:07.463 --> 01:14:13.104]  You know, my dad's a cool guy, nice guy, but he was really excited about the new Blade Runner and he got tickets and wanted me and my son to go.
[01:14:13.124 --> 01:14:14.584]  And I said, Dad, I just, I'm going to work.
[01:14:14.604 --> 01:14:15.204]  I don't want to go.
[01:14:15.244 --> 01:14:17.004]  And he went and picked my son up.
[01:14:17.264 --> 01:14:24.846]  And my son said to his grandfather, he said, let's just go over to your house and swim in your pool with grandma and maybe play cards or something.
[01:14:25.406 --> 01:14:27.206]  I don't want to go see a Hollywood movie.
[01:14:29.224 --> 01:14:30.185]  I didn't have to tell him that.
[01:14:32.547 --> 01:14:37.511]  He didn't want to watch... Hollywood.
[01:14:40.093 --> 01:14:41.895]  You don't want to be part of it.
[01:14:42.415 --> 01:14:49.321]  It's finale, final, bye bye, ship sailed, train left the station, gate got left open, the cows are gone.
[01:14:50.302 --> 01:14:50.762]  It's done.
[01:14:51.723 --> 01:14:54.125]  And they don't, you don't think they don't know that?
[01:14:55.854 --> 01:14:57.715]  They want to sexualize your children.
[01:14:58.196 --> 01:14:59.496]  They want to brain damage them.
[01:14:59.536 --> 01:15:00.497]  They want to inject them.
[01:15:00.937 --> 01:15:06.201]  CNN admits a normal ingestion of the fluoride they put in the average U.S.
[01:15:06.221 --> 01:15:12.645]  water supply, 1.3 parts per million, lowers your child's IQ by 15 points.
[01:15:13.505 --> 01:15:16.327]  A kick in the head from a horse when they're two years old won't do that.
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:20.760]  And you know what?
[01:15:21.281 --> 01:15:25.483]  The average vaccine schedule they now admit is upwards of a 20 point reduction.
[01:15:26.203 --> 01:15:26.503]  15 to 20.
[01:15:26.763 --> 01:15:28.184]  We're talking 30 points, folks.
[01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:31.585]  That takes you from 130, which is near genius, to regular.
[01:15:31.965 --> 01:15:35.187]  If you were just to be a regular person, that's mentally retarded.
[01:15:38.823 --> 01:15:42.065]  But you don't get a Down Syndrome chromosomal manifestation.
[01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:47.368]  You get somebody who had a high-powered brain, but it's so fried they've got autism.
[01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:51.531]  Which is what soldiers get hit with chemical weapons act like they got autism too.
[01:15:51.791 --> 01:15:53.572]  They sit in the corner and do this the rest of their lives.
[01:15:53.972 --> 01:15:55.273]  That's what chemical weapons do.
[01:15:56.914 --> 01:15:57.834]  Comprende?
[01:15:58.615 --> 01:15:59.555]  You have been warned.
[01:15:59.835 --> 01:16:00.896]  Phone calls straight ahead.
[01:16:02.317 --> 01:16:03.858]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:10.464]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:16:10.724 --> 01:16:11.845]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[01:16:12.105 --> 01:16:14.407]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:16:15.067 --> 01:16:21.592]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:16:21.792 --> 01:16:24.754]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[01:16:25.434 --> 01:16:27.236]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:16:27.876 --> 01:16:36.301]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:16:36.321 --> 01:16:37.302]  They know how great it is.
[01:16:38.203 --> 01:16:42.005]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:16:42.805 --> 01:16:44.326]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[01:16:45.107 --> 01:16:52.972]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[01:16:53.412 --> 01:16:55.974]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:16:56.514 --> 01:17:01.876]  Brain Force Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[01:17:02.436 --> 01:17:04.837]  That comes to $50.03.
[01:17:05.097 --> 01:17:09.018]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[01:17:09.438 --> 01:17:12.579]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:15.621]  It's a good deal at $39.

[01:18:21.005 --> 01:18:26.331]  And we're not just going to have to end the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[01:18:26.691 --> 01:18:35.601]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth Turmeric Chaga Mushroom Bee Pollen and more.
[01:18:36.101 --> 01:18:36.742]  Concentrate.
[01:18:36.762 --> 01:18:38.544]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[01:18:38.824 --> 01:18:40.226]  Next level compared to whey.
[01:18:40.246 --> 01:18:42.087]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:18:42.508 --> 01:18:43.369]  It's incredible.
[01:18:43.849 --> 01:18:45.771]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:18:45.952 --> 01:18:47.093]  It's bigger than I am already.
[01:18:47.553 --> 01:18:48.454]  At 15, incredible.
[01:18:48.775 --> 01:18:49.656]  It is amazing.
[01:18:50.036 --> 01:18:51.297]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:18:52.078 --> 01:18:54.401]  50% off Caveman, but only a few days left.
[01:18:54.661 --> 01:18:55.402]  It's about to end.
[01:18:55.982 --> 01:18:58.323]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[01:18:58.764 --> 01:19:03.926]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[01:19:04.347 --> 01:19:05.747]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:07.148]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[01:19:07.548 --> 01:19:08.349]  I want to thank you.
[01:19:08.689 --> 01:19:09.729]  We're all in this together.
[01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:20.155]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[01:19:26.379 --> 01:19:36.305]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[01:19:36.565 --> 01:19:41.909]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[01:19:55.678 --> 01:20:00.502]  That's 50% off Rainforest Plus and 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[01:20:05.925 --> 01:20:08.587]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.157 --> 01:20:25.320]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.781 --> 01:20:37.028]  Notice you don't hear stuff like this in Hollywood movies anymore.
[01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:40.750]  Because Hollywood's been dead for a long time.
[01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:43.232]  Let's see.
[01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:46.234]  Hollywood wanted to drag the rest of the world with it.
[01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:49.477]  And they've been rejected all over the planet.
[01:20:49.997 --> 01:20:51.918]  So for the last 10 years, they've been bankrupt.
[01:20:51.938 --> 01:20:54.959]  And the communist Chinese have been bankrolling them.
[01:20:55.219 --> 01:20:57.300]  And that didn't save them either.
[01:20:58.581 --> 01:21:00.562]  Now it's accelerated their collapse.
[01:21:02.803 --> 01:21:09.386]  And I don't vengefully take pleasure in watching this group of pedophiles start to really accelerate their journey to hell.
[01:21:10.627 --> 01:21:15.829]  I take pleasure to breathe in air and feel a little bit less weight on my soul.
[01:21:18.888 --> 01:21:19.308]  We're close.
[01:21:19.888 --> 01:21:20.749]  It's going to be rough though.
[01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:22.129]  We've turned the tide.
[01:21:23.390 --> 01:21:25.230]  Make no mistake, praise God for that.
[01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:33.013]  And thank his son Jesus Christ for what he did on the cross because these enemies hate it because they know how real it is.
[01:21:33.593 --> 01:21:35.594]  It has spiritual power over them.
[01:21:36.794 --> 01:21:38.195]  It binds them and they know it.
[01:21:38.875 --> 01:21:39.755]  It's the trump card.
[01:21:42.896 --> 01:21:46.958]  I'm going to go to your phone calls and then as I said a little bit earlier,
[01:21:48.453 --> 01:21:50.755]  It is absolutely admitted now.
[01:21:52.197 --> 01:21:56.160]  And they're trying to walk it back, and they don't know how to kind of let it out.
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:01.285]  And notice, just a week ago, it was the biggest story in the world.
[01:22:01.305 --> 01:22:02.566]  We're going to get your guns.
[01:22:02.947 --> 01:22:04.488]  The Second Amendment's to blame.
[01:22:04.888 --> 01:22:06.270]  Christians are to blame.
[01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:07.831]  White people are inherently evil.
[01:22:08.592 --> 01:22:10.494]  It's always weird white people saying it.
[01:22:11.886 --> 01:22:19.849]  Because I don't like quoting the people saying it without pointing out most of them are white because it makes it sound like folks that aren't white are the ones saying it and then it creates division.
[01:22:19.909 --> 01:22:24.031]  No, it's 95% of it white people trying to get a race war going.
[01:22:24.611 --> 01:22:29.313]  Because they're the crooks up there running things and they know we're waking up so they want us at each other's throats.
[01:22:29.373 --> 01:22:31.133]  I mean, this is ridiculously obvious!
[01:22:33.034 --> 01:22:33.754]  We're so close.
[01:22:36.875 --> 01:22:37.636]  But it's epic.
[01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:45.622]  They started coming out two days ago going, okay, maybe ISIS was involved in the Associated Press, in Reuters, and then in Newsweek, yesterday.
[01:22:45.642 --> 01:23:00.447]  And they went, okay, looks like there is Islamic connections, and well, there is a cover-up, and the timeline's changing, and other people were shot, we hadn't told you about it, and turns out the whole timeline's not right, and hey, listen.
[01:23:03.908 --> 01:23:06.869]  Now, the cops from day one have been leaking this, okay?
[01:23:07.682 --> 01:23:12.083]  And listen, you think I want to be the one that had the hostage rescue team connection?
[01:23:12.803 --> 01:23:13.943]  To always be up front?
[01:23:14.903 --> 01:23:16.144]  To take the danger of that?
[01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:17.664]  I'm not saying that to act cool, folks.
[01:23:18.044 --> 01:23:19.324]  It's dangerous doing this.
[01:23:20.804 --> 01:23:22.165]  It's dangerous to the people that gave it to us.
[01:23:24.465 --> 01:23:26.406]  They said, there's Islamic stuff all over the room.
[01:23:26.586 --> 01:23:28.166]  There's anti-Islamic stuff, trips to the Middle East.
[01:23:28.606 --> 01:23:29.786]  It all came out a week later!
[01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:32.567]  What's in the news now?
[01:23:33.227 --> 01:23:33.927]  And I'm going to your calls.
[01:23:37.307 --> 01:23:38.488]  Adon Salazar.
[01:23:38.668 --> 01:23:40.069]  This story should go around the world.
[01:23:40.529 --> 01:23:41.950]  It's on NewsWars.com.
[01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:43.451]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:23:43.631 --> 01:23:51.596]  But what's crazy is, it's linked here to mainstream news.
[01:23:51.656 --> 01:23:54.158]  In fact, print me that first link out of Adon's article, please.
[01:23:54.178 --> 01:23:55.419]  I want to have that to show folks as well.
[01:23:56.319 --> 01:24:02.183]  Because if I don't, the media is so deceptive, they'll go, look, Jones put out fake news that the person had said this when they actually said it.
[01:24:02.443 --> 01:24:03.664]  So I want to show the source of that.
[01:24:06.013 --> 01:24:13.855]  Mandalay Bay owner, what's being expressed by police may not be accurate.
[01:24:14.835 --> 01:24:23.057]  That's out of Fox in Las Vegas, Nevada and the Associated Press.
[01:24:24.798 --> 01:24:25.178]  There it is.
[01:24:25.218 --> 01:24:27.898]  Hotel questions new timeline of Vegas shooting.
[01:24:28.339 --> 01:24:30.739]  I'll say it again as I said last Friday.
[01:24:32.019 --> 01:24:34.140]  The cover-up has collapsed.
[01:24:37.332 --> 01:24:39.193]  We know there were multiple shooters.
[01:24:39.833 --> 01:24:42.494]  We know more people were shot in other locations than they've shed.
[01:24:43.054 --> 01:24:44.594]  We know there's an Islamic connection.
[01:24:45.034 --> 01:24:47.255]  And we've even got it from the White House.
[01:24:47.675 --> 01:24:51.917]  And by the way, I had it from the White House before the Republican operative came out.
[01:24:52.317 --> 01:24:54.317]  I just don't want to blow our sources.
[01:24:59.079 --> 01:25:00.539]  And there's not many left.
[01:25:05.221 --> 01:25:05.781]  So that's why.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.080]  But they know.
[01:25:08.401 --> 01:25:09.081]  I know they know.
[01:25:09.181 --> 01:25:12.984]  So what's the point of hiding your line under a bushel?
[01:25:14.265 --> 01:25:14.865]  So here it is.
[01:25:14.925 --> 01:25:15.926]  Associated Press.
[01:25:17.187 --> 01:25:18.167]  Mandalay Bay owner.
[01:25:18.888 --> 01:25:21.209]  What's being expressed by police may not be accurate.
[01:25:21.610 --> 01:25:25.872]  We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been communicated publicly.
[01:25:25.892 --> 01:25:26.833]  I'm certain.
[01:25:27.193 --> 01:25:27.734]  Think so?
[01:25:29.304 --> 01:25:37.752]  You got hotels a mile away with glass and bullet casings everywhere, and police shooting other men, and shootouts in other parts of the city, all over police scanners.
[01:25:38.292 --> 01:25:40.394]  It wasn't fog of war, it was cops reporting.
[01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:42.636]  Shots fired, people shooting here, people shooting there.
[01:25:42.656 --> 01:25:43.437]  They weren't panicked.
[01:25:44.538 --> 01:25:46.100]  The cab driver's like, well, that's far away.
[01:25:48.001 --> 01:25:49.703]  And then she's at Mandalay, right above her.
[01:25:50.143 --> 01:25:51.425]  Seconds later, the guns go off.
[01:25:51.765 --> 01:25:52.586]  It's not an echo.
[01:25:53.046 --> 01:25:54.788]  Anybody that's shot firearms knows that.
[01:25:56.158 --> 01:26:00.661]  I've heard people shoot full-auto out in the countryside, a mile away, sounds just like that.
[01:26:02.822 --> 01:26:03.502]  And then BAM!
[01:26:03.543 --> 01:26:03.763]  BAM!
[01:26:03.803 --> 01:26:04.003]  BAM!
[01:26:04.043 --> 01:26:04.203]  BAM!
[01:26:04.243 --> 01:26:04.423]  BAM!
[01:26:04.463 --> 01:26:05.584]  Right on top of her.
[01:26:06.204 --> 01:26:07.445]  She's sitting in the same spot.
[01:26:09.446 --> 01:26:10.867]  But I already had the sources.
[01:26:12.808 --> 01:26:13.789]  We already had all the info.
[01:26:13.809 --> 01:26:14.949]  We already know.
[01:26:17.811 --> 01:26:18.992]  There's a giant cover-up.
[01:26:19.032 --> 01:26:20.413]  There was a giant terror attack.
[01:26:22.554 --> 01:26:23.635]  Part of it got stopped.
[01:26:24.575 --> 01:26:25.456]  A bunch of it didn't.
[01:26:27.153 --> 01:26:31.214]  And they don't want to tell America that ISIS attacked a major city.
[01:26:32.034 --> 01:26:40.897]  And the argument is, from the White House sources, is they've told the President, sir, if you do that, it will trigger the other mass attacks.
[01:26:40.977 --> 01:26:43.798]  And see, you can tell that what the intel operatives at the top are globalists.
[01:26:44.138 --> 01:26:55.601]  When all hell breaks loose, as I said months ago, they're going to use the ISIS attack as the cover for the Antifa and others and then more professional teams after that to target folks politically and say, oh, it's just
[01:26:57.196 --> 01:26:57.536]  ISIS.
[01:26:59.718 --> 01:27:13.527]  So the next time they really launch the attack and it's 500 targets in one hour, no one's going to notice in all the hubbub certain political leaders getting attacked and taken out as well.
[01:27:14.547 --> 01:27:22.593]  They already tried, and even the Washington Times did an in-depth investigation, and law enforcement believes that was a target to take out 15 members of Congress to trigger a special election.
[01:27:22.653 --> 01:27:24.134]  That was a setup.
[01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:26.711]  By another Dennis Hastert lookalike.
[01:27:26.731 --> 01:27:28.372]  It's like an army of these guys.
[01:27:30.714 --> 01:27:32.495]  When you read criminology, they don't know why.
[01:27:32.935 --> 01:27:36.198]  It's just, it's weird how certain criminal types look certain ways.
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:39.860]  It's just, it's bizarre.
[01:27:42.262 --> 01:27:46.725]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know all of it, okay?
[01:27:47.306 --> 01:27:49.127]  Because the enemy's got different plans as well.
[01:27:49.827 --> 01:27:53.390]  But they got a bunch of stuff cooking right now, and I'm telling you,
[01:27:55.615 --> 01:28:08.625]  This month and coming into November 4th, you're going to see stuff happen, if we don't derail this and stop it by exposing it, that's gonna make Mandalay and that event look like child's play.
[01:28:09.846 --> 01:28:11.227]  And don't say you haven't been warned.
[01:28:12.308 --> 01:28:12.929]  And let me tell you something.
[01:28:18.353 --> 01:28:24.478]  Listeners, if you're awake working the night shift, and there's a mass shooting, you gotta call your whole family and say, get up.
[01:28:25.575 --> 01:28:37.465]  Because when the big one comes and they attack a bunch of targets, we need people up during the night understanding and videotaping and exposing what's happening and reporting on it ahead of the morning.
[01:28:37.585 --> 01:28:39.807]  Because they're going to want a lot of time to get their narrative straight.
[01:28:39.827 --> 01:28:42.950]  That's why I think they target during shift change, 10 p.m.
[01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:49.956]  to midnight, where most forces are having shift changes in much of the country, the east coast, central areas and mountain.
[01:28:51.741 --> 01:28:53.242]  I think they've already got the West Coast.
[01:28:54.223 --> 01:28:57.205]  And just a lot of stuff goes into that computation, prime analysis.
[01:28:57.506 --> 01:28:58.727]  We'll be back with your polls, I promise.
[01:29:02.429 --> 01:29:03.971]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[01:29:05.239 --> 01:29:10.583]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:29:10.843 --> 01:29:11.964]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[01:29:12.224 --> 01:29:14.526]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:29:15.186 --> 01:29:21.711]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:29:21.911 --> 01:29:25.253]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[01:29:25.553 --> 01:29:27.355]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:29:28.015 --> 01:29:36.425]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:29:36.445 --> 01:29:37.406]  They know how great it is.
[01:29:38.327 --> 01:29:42.111]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:29:42.932 --> 01:29:44.373]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[01:29:45.214 --> 01:29:53.078]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[01:29:53.519 --> 01:30:00.342]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[01:30:01.023 --> 01:30:04.965]  That comes to 50.03.
[01:30:05.105 --> 01:30:09.167]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[01:30:09.567 --> 01:30:12.469]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:15.750]  It's a good deal at $39.
[01:30:16.090 --> 01:30:27.613]  It's 1996 at Infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:30:27.853 --> 01:30:41.676]  And when you purchase Brain Force Plus or any of the other great products like Secret 12, Caveman, Oxy Powder, Super Mel Vitality, our fluoride-free Super Blue, colloidal silver, and iodine-empowered toothpaste, you get

[01:30:59.361 --> 01:31:01.922]  Again, that's infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:31:02.602 --> 01:31:20.387]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[01:31:21.127 --> 01:31:26.450]  And we're not just going to have to end the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:34.215]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth turmeric chaga mushroom bee pollen.
[01:31:35.245 --> 01:31:35.746]  And more.
[01:31:36.226 --> 01:31:36.867]  Concentrate.
[01:31:36.887 --> 01:31:38.668]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[01:31:38.929 --> 01:31:40.370]  Next level compared to whey.
[01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:42.212]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:31:42.632 --> 01:31:43.493]  It's incredible.
[01:31:43.974 --> 01:31:45.875]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:31:46.076 --> 01:31:48.017]  It's bigger than I am already at 15.
[01:31:48.098 --> 01:31:48.578]  Incredible.
[01:31:48.898 --> 01:31:49.779]  It is amazing.
[01:31:50.139 --> 01:31:51.421]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:52.181 --> 01:31:52.982]  50% off Caveman.
[01:31:53.202 --> 01:31:54.524]  But only a few days left.
[01:31:54.784 --> 01:31:55.525]  It's about to end.
[01:31:56.105 --> 01:31:58.447]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[01:31:58.887 --> 01:32:04.051]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[01:32:04.471 --> 01:32:05.872]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[01:32:06.112 --> 01:32:07.293]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[01:32:07.673 --> 01:32:08.474]  I want to thank you.
[01:32:08.794 --> 01:32:09.855]  We're all in this together.
[01:32:10.375 --> 01:32:20.262]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,
[01:32:21.002 --> 01:32:24.444]  On sale right now at InfoWarsLive.com, you're fighting the tip of the spear.
[01:32:24.665 --> 01:32:26.486]  But these specials have got to end.

[01:33:22.162 --> 01:33:26.225]  Get up!
[01:33:29.747 --> 01:33:31.568]  Eject!
[01:33:31.608 --> 01:33:36.732]  Escape from the prison planet!
[01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:52.852]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:54.113 --> 01:33:56.535]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:56.555 --> 01:33:59.618]  We're trying to escape from the prison planet.
[01:33:59.738 --> 01:34:00.499]  We only got one.
[01:34:00.999 --> 01:34:06.984]  We're trying to stop the planet from being turned into a giant panopticonic technotronic technocracy control grid.
[01:34:07.664 --> 01:34:14.470]  And by the way, that's the globalist's own words and own plan to turn this into a veritable
[01:34:15.742 --> 01:34:24.644]  Cruisin' Planet with a permanent superclass run by a bunch of bloodthirsty pedophile sociopath psychopath globalists.
[01:34:25.805 --> 01:34:31.466]  It's up to us that want a future, every race, color, creed, religion, ethnicity that want freedom.
[01:34:31.966 --> 01:34:36.248]  And I do believe there's good people in every group to stand together for freedom.
[01:34:36.428 --> 01:34:38.088]  All right, I said I'm taking calls today.
[01:34:38.528 --> 01:34:40.269]  We're gonna take a lot of them throughout the broadcast.
[01:34:41.949 --> 01:34:44.410]  But I want to play one more little piece here before we do.
[01:34:45.947 --> 01:34:59.895]  When you listen to the audio of Mr. Weinstein trying to get a woman to come into a room where he's gonna disrobe and take a shower in front of her, it's all about degradation.
[01:35:00.976 --> 01:35:02.877]  It's all about humiliation.
[01:35:04.258 --> 01:35:07.980]  It's all about them force-feeding us their culture.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.542]  When they want to sexualize your children with Hollywood,
[01:35:11.772 --> 01:35:13.392]  And Sumner Redstone's Nickelodeon.
[01:35:13.753 --> 01:35:30.157]  And when they want the Hollywood-run sex education of five-year-olds to confuse their sexuality and do things that even Camille Paglia calls child abuse, it is a manifestation of their creepy pervertedness.
[01:35:31.298 --> 01:35:35.879]  They want to control and run your life like MSNBC says in their promos.
[01:35:36.826 --> 01:35:39.128]  Your kids don't belong to you, they belong to the state.
[01:35:39.488 --> 01:35:42.810]  They want to say outrageous things to break your will.
[01:35:43.591 --> 01:35:50.336]  They've got all these Oscar announcements, you name it, with them making jokes about Weinstein for a decade plus.
[01:35:51.217 --> 01:35:53.038]  That story's up on Infowars.com.
[01:35:53.538 --> 01:35:56.861]  Oscar attendees once laughed at Weinstein being a sexual predator.
[01:35:57.947 --> 01:36:06.673]  But it's not a joke and you've got Clooney and Merrick Damon and you've got all the Ben Affleck usual suspects helping cover it up.
[01:36:07.934 --> 01:36:16.220]  Coming out and defending him and saying he didn't do this when they all knew while they posed as these big pro-women advocates.
[01:36:18.782 --> 01:36:22.525]  They're the scum of the earth, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:24.918 --> 01:36:26.579]  And Hollywood is collapsing.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:28.381]  It doesn't have any power anymore.
[01:36:28.821 --> 01:36:30.663]  So yeah, there's a lot of people that played along with it.
[01:36:30.683 --> 01:36:33.025]  A lot of these women are just as guilty of the same type of stuff.
[01:36:33.245 --> 01:36:37.088]  Meryl Streep, she defends child rapist Roman Polanski.
[01:36:37.749 --> 01:36:42.773]  Just recently said he should be let out of jail over in Europe and, you know, says that he's a good guy.
[01:36:43.854 --> 01:36:48.177]  And does standing ovations for a guy that kidnapped and raped a 13-year-old girl.
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:53.784]  But suddenly, oh, she's against Weinstein because the power's gone!
[01:36:53.804 --> 01:36:55.966]  Yeah, Hollywood's been dead a while.
[01:36:55.986 --> 01:36:58.950]  We're gonna go to Randall that wants to talk about that in a moment.
[01:37:00.592 --> 01:37:03.816]  But their attempt to kill the rest of the country and the world is failing.
[01:37:04.016 --> 01:37:04.937]  That's what's important.
[01:37:05.358 --> 01:37:09.482]  We've been the prodigal son, pulling away from these scam artists.
[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:12.040]  This is a good day, my friends.
[01:37:12.461 --> 01:37:14.261]  It's all dying at a faster rate.
[01:37:14.281 --> 01:37:18.362]  The NFL, mainstream television, the entire Hollywood devil worshiper pedophile cult.
[01:37:18.982 --> 01:37:20.743]  Everyone addresses them as the pedophile cult.
[01:37:21.023 --> 01:37:21.763]  It's over!
[01:37:22.223 --> 01:37:23.143]  Devastation!
[01:37:23.604 --> 01:37:25.364]  Victory against their forces!
[01:37:26.284 --> 01:37:27.745]  Now they're striking back in other ways.
[01:37:28.605 --> 01:37:31.106]  Through the fluoride, through the vaccines, through their soft kill.
[01:37:31.146 --> 01:37:33.206]  They want to hurt children for their God.
[01:37:33.966 --> 01:37:35.507]  They want to hurt innocent women.
[01:37:35.747 --> 01:37:36.227]  And here it is.
[01:37:38.035 --> 01:37:38.756]  Don't do it, J-Mo.
[01:37:38.816 --> 01:37:40.800]  You don't want to mess with Weird Al.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:41.721]  Oh, please.
[01:37:41.741 --> 01:37:44.005]  I'm not afraid of anyone in show business.
[01:37:44.486 --> 01:37:48.393]  I turned down intercourse with Harvey Weinstein on no less than three occasions.
[01:37:48.413 --> 01:37:49.394]  Out of five.
[01:37:58.729 --> 01:37:59.871]  What do we have to do here?
[01:37:59.931 --> 01:38:00.431]  Nothing.
[01:38:00.732 --> 01:38:01.653]  I'm going to take a shower.
[01:38:01.713 --> 01:38:02.915]  You sit there and have a drink.
[01:38:02.955 --> 01:38:03.475]  Water.
[01:38:03.515 --> 01:38:04.236]  I don't drink.
[01:38:04.316 --> 01:38:05.959]  Can I stay on the bar?
[01:38:06.079 --> 01:38:06.299]  No.
[01:38:06.419 --> 01:38:07.501]  You must come here now.
[01:38:07.641 --> 01:38:07.881]  No.
[01:38:09.022 --> 01:38:09.282]  Please.
[01:38:09.362 --> 01:38:10.023]  No, I don't want to.
[01:38:10.043 --> 01:38:11.664]  I'm not doing anything to you.
[01:38:11.784 --> 01:38:12.445]  I know, I know.
[01:38:12.505 --> 01:38:13.705]  I'm sorry, I don't know.
[01:38:13.725 --> 01:38:14.786]  Don't come in here.
[01:38:14.826 --> 01:38:17.128]  No, yesterday was kind of aggressive for me.
[01:38:17.148 --> 01:38:17.348]  I know.
[01:38:17.548 --> 01:38:18.829]  I don't feel comfortable.
[01:38:18.909 --> 01:38:20.510]  I mean, don't have a fight with me in the hall.
[01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:22.452]  Please, I'm not going to do anything.
[01:38:22.492 --> 01:38:23.773]  I swear on my children.
[01:38:23.913 --> 01:38:24.653]  Please come in.
[01:38:24.993 --> 01:38:25.874]  I'm a famous guy.
[01:38:26.014 --> 01:38:28.296]  I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now.
[01:38:28.316 --> 01:38:29.557]  Please come in now.
[01:38:30.257 --> 01:38:33.998]  I want to start by thanking Harvey Weinstein for organizing this amazing day.
[01:38:34.018 --> 01:38:34.238]  Harvey.
[01:39:01.445 --> 01:39:03.326]  This is possible because of Harvey.
[01:39:03.726 --> 01:39:09.668]  He is a wonderful human being, a good friend, and just a powerhouse.
[01:39:09.868 --> 01:39:11.129]  I just want to thank God.
[01:39:11.769 --> 01:39:12.770]  Harvey Weinstein.
[01:39:18.892 --> 01:39:19.632]  The Punisher.
[01:39:20.813 --> 01:39:21.913]  Old Testament, I guess.
[01:39:22.674 --> 01:39:28.536]  And I just want to congratulate Harvey and his wife Georgina on the birth of their new baby boy.
[01:39:30.046 --> 01:39:30.707]  Truly sickening.
[01:39:31.007 --> 01:39:32.949]  Harvey gave us just what we needed, another him.
[01:39:33.409 --> 01:39:38.513]  He got you a wedged tardle, didn't he?
[01:39:38.934 --> 01:39:42.056]  If he's anything like his dad, he's going to be relentless, passionate.
[01:39:45.439 --> 01:39:49.022]  You can stop kissing up to me for forgetting to thank me at the Oscars.
[01:39:51.204 --> 01:39:52.726]  Let's just do what we're here to do.
[01:39:55.527 --> 01:39:56.148]  Awkward.
[01:39:56.949 --> 01:39:58.150]  Are we asking for it?
[01:39:58.650 --> 01:40:03.515]  You know, by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality?
[01:40:03.535 --> 01:40:09.481]  The 2012 nominees for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role.
[01:40:10.122 --> 01:40:14.647]  Congratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.
[01:40:16.569 --> 01:40:18.611]  You put the house lights on?
[01:40:21.553 --> 01:40:23.194]  Meryl Streep, call me God, it doesn't work.
[01:40:23.294 --> 01:40:23.914]  Oh, it does work.
[01:40:23.934 --> 01:40:26.435]  Did you know, you know what I mean, at the time?
[01:40:26.455 --> 01:40:27.795]  I mean, I guess it's not as a kid.
[01:40:27.815 --> 01:40:28.996]  No, Clint.
[01:40:29.016 --> 01:40:29.776]  I did, later on.
[01:40:31.477 --> 01:40:34.958]  I don't think it's only Harvey Weinstein.
[01:40:35.678 --> 01:40:37.199]  I don't think we're only looking at him.
[01:40:37.639 --> 01:40:40.200]  I think we're looking at a world much deeper than that.
[01:40:42.955 --> 01:40:43.776]  And that's a threat.
[01:40:43.816 --> 01:40:45.637]  You bring him down, we'll bring you all down.
[01:40:45.677 --> 01:40:47.979]  The whole sickening empire has already collapsed.
[01:40:48.019 --> 01:40:48.959]  Babylon has fallen.
[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:51.301]  At least that corner of the command post has.
[01:40:52.021 --> 01:40:54.043]  The pedophilia, it's all coming out.
[01:40:55.264 --> 01:41:02.409]  Let me just tell folks right now that I have financed multiple teams.
[01:41:04.450 --> 01:41:09.754]  High-level connections internationally, law enforcement, you name it, that are on the trails of all these people.
[01:41:11.124 --> 01:41:12.585]  And they already know that.
[01:41:12.785 --> 01:41:17.747]  And they also know that people like Eric Prince is on their tail.
[01:41:19.187 --> 01:41:21.088]  The same Hollywood that's attacked and demonized him.
[01:41:21.809 --> 01:41:22.989]  Most of it, it's not true.
[01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:31.333]  But it's not just people like Eric Prince or myself that are helping expose the pedophile rings.
[01:41:31.593 --> 01:41:32.113]  It's you.
[01:41:34.214 --> 01:41:35.014]  And they will fall.
[01:41:36.755 --> 01:41:38.656]  A big reason this is coming out is
[01:41:42.358 --> 01:41:48.823]  The media hopes that they can just make it about men oppressing women.
[01:41:49.824 --> 01:41:55.729]  And believe me, they've got women in Hollywood procuring women, and they've got whole systems of women dominating women.
[01:42:00.292 --> 01:42:04.816]  And the fact that this is breaking out in Hollywood like this just shows the weakness of their entire system.
[01:42:06.037 --> 01:42:11.542]  But it will take down the Clintons, who aren't just rapists, and don't just defend rapists.
[01:42:12.267 --> 01:42:13.428]  And don't just support rapists.
[01:42:14.908 --> 01:42:22.813]  But they fly around on Lolita Express all over the world on an aircraft with kidnapped children.
[01:42:23.973 --> 01:42:25.334]  And what do they do as that comes out?
[01:42:25.394 --> 01:42:31.777]  Well, they make it about a pizza place, get everybody to cover it, then say we created the story about the pizza place when CNN did.
[01:42:33.562 --> 01:42:35.764]  Say we said things about the pizza place we didn't say.
[01:42:35.784 --> 01:42:39.106]  Have us clarify it and then say pedophilia doesn't exist.
[01:42:39.547 --> 01:42:43.710]  Really, the Deputy Pope just got arrested for reportedly kidnapping over 100 little boys.
[01:42:44.851 --> 01:42:47.673]  You gonna tell us about Pizzagate on that one, you old demons?
[01:42:48.374 --> 01:42:49.134]  Good luck.
[01:42:49.895 --> 01:42:51.756]  None of your PR campaigns went anywhere.
[01:42:52.257 --> 01:42:55.619]  They blew up in your big old fat New World Order faces.
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:43:01.344]  Now I promise, the minute we come out of this break, I'm going right to Randall and others that are holding stay with us.
[01:43:02.759 --> 01:43:10.907]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:43:11.167 --> 01:43:14.850]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:43:15.511 --> 01:43:22.017]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:43:22.237 --> 01:43:25.561]  So I'm offering for the first time ever, 50% off.
[01:43:25.881 --> 01:43:27.683]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:43:28.323 --> 01:43:36.731]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:43:36.771 --> 01:43:37.732]  They know how great it is.
[01:43:38.653 --> 01:43:42.436]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:43:43.257 --> 01:43:44.698]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[01:43:45.519 --> 01:43:53.406]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[01:43:53.846 --> 01:44:02.333]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[01:44:02.873 --> 01:44:05.295]  That comes to 50.03.
[01:44:05.435 --> 01:44:09.499]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[01:44:09.899 --> 01:44:12.801]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[01:44:15.203 --> 01:44:16.064]  It's a good deal at $39.

[01:45:27.135 --> 01:45:35.982]  I'm gonna have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[01:45:36.542 --> 01:45:37.182]  Concentrate.
[01:45:37.202 --> 01:45:38.983]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[01:45:39.243 --> 01:45:40.684]  Next level compared to whey.
[01:45:40.904 --> 01:45:42.524]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:45:42.944 --> 01:45:43.805]  It's incredible.
[01:45:44.285 --> 01:45:46.185]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:45:46.205 --> 01:45:48.326]  He's bigger than I am already at 15.
[01:45:48.406 --> 01:45:48.886]  Incredible.
[01:45:49.207 --> 01:45:50.087]  It is amazing.

[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:19.501]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:21.882 --> 01:47:26.683]  Alright, I apologize, and I mean it, for not getting your calls the last 45 minutes, but I'm gonna go to all of them right now.
[01:47:26.763 --> 01:47:31.525]  Randall, Dave, Andy, Kelly, Phillip, Kenny, Josh, and others.
[01:47:32.065 --> 01:47:34.946]  Randall in Florida says Hollywood's been dead for a while.
[01:47:35.626 --> 01:47:39.147]  Again, I agree with that, but now it's officially becoming dead.
[01:47:39.327 --> 01:47:41.187]  The whole combine, the NFL, all of it.
[01:47:41.728 --> 01:47:42.948]  Go ahead, Randall, thanks for holding.
[01:47:44.605 --> 01:47:45.565]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:47:45.585 --> 01:47:49.546]  Before I do that, I just want to say, first time I ever saw you was years ago.
[01:47:49.586 --> 01:47:58.968]  You came to the Orlando High Live and gave a live, I believe it was a Sunday broadcast, and that's actually what woke me up to everything that's going on.
[01:47:58.988 --> 01:48:00.649]  So I want to thank you for that off the bat.
[01:48:00.669 --> 01:48:01.169]  I remember that.
[01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:05.730]  That was a capacity crowd by the local station where we were number one.
[01:48:06.930 --> 01:48:11.973]  Beat Rush Limbaugh there in Orlando, then they took us off the station, which was okay, and made it all sports.
[01:48:12.553 --> 01:48:16.495]  They came and basically bought them out to get me off the air, but that was a good speech we gave.
[01:48:16.555 --> 01:48:17.115]  Thanks for being there.
[01:48:19.279 --> 01:48:20.379]  It was a pleasure to be on there.
[01:48:20.459 --> 01:48:23.020]  Yeah, I think Hollywood's been dead for a while.
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:30.682]  I look at it like a grenade that somebody's pulled the pin and tossed it into the middle of California and we're just waiting for it to explode.
[01:48:31.163 --> 01:48:46.387]  They really have nobody to blame but themselves because what's happened is that they've got rid of any sort of identifiable conservative actor, actresses, comedian from Tim Allen to Sam Elliott to Randy Quaid to Rick Moranis.
[01:48:47.267 --> 01:49:14.120]  What's actually even funny about Rick Moranis is, I believe years ago, because he was a big-time actor in the 80s and early 90s, and he all of a sudden stopped acting, and the story was that he was tired of Disney and Nickelodeon, as you pointed out, starting to sexualize children, so he stopped acting and started teaching at a non-liberal, pro-conservative university, where I believe he still teaches to this day.
[01:49:15.066 --> 01:49:15.566]  That's right.
[01:49:15.686 --> 01:49:21.350]  It's all about the sexualization of children, the targeting, the destruction of beauty, of innocence.
[01:49:21.991 --> 01:49:23.712]  And that's what all these guys are into.
[01:49:23.732 --> 01:49:26.854]  And there's just such a soulless feeling there.
[01:49:27.354 --> 01:49:29.596]  And you've said the most astute thing I've heard in weeks.
[01:49:30.436 --> 01:49:31.897]  When you liken them to a hand grenade.
[01:49:32.477 --> 01:49:39.082]  When they sent Megyn Kelly out and the mainstream media built her up as a goddess, that was killing her.
[01:49:40.401 --> 01:49:44.802]  But they sent her out like a hand grenade they threw to blow up, to destroy me and Trump and others.
[01:49:45.283 --> 01:49:46.143]  And it's the same thing.
[01:49:46.203 --> 01:49:48.203]  These corporate execs know they're on the run.
[01:49:49.264 --> 01:49:59.927]  They just keep trying to find mercenaries that will go out and do these heinous things and lie like this to carry it out.
[01:49:59.967 --> 01:50:02.168]  But it's just nothing works anymore.
[01:50:02.228 --> 01:50:03.448]  God bless you, Randall.
[01:50:03.688 --> 01:50:05.569]  It was good, I guess, to meet you out there in Florida.
[01:50:06.489 --> 01:50:07.249]  That was the old days.
[01:50:07.309 --> 01:50:09.290]  I drove the family bus out there with my children.
[01:50:10.572 --> 01:50:11.794]  And my ex-wife.
[01:50:11.834 --> 01:50:14.939]  I remember when I used to be able to travel more.
[01:50:14.959 --> 01:50:16.301]  It was great to meet folks.
[01:50:16.942 --> 01:50:18.464]  Let's go ahead and go to another caller.
[01:50:18.605 --> 01:50:19.846]  Phillip in California.
[01:50:19.866 --> 01:50:20.467]  You're on the air.
[01:50:20.487 --> 01:50:21.389]  Thanks for holding.
[01:50:22.511 --> 01:50:23.172]  Hey, no problem.
[01:50:23.212 --> 01:50:23.993]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:50:24.333 --> 01:50:24.874]  Good, my friend.
[01:50:24.914 --> 01:50:25.215]  Go ahead.
[01:50:26.414 --> 01:50:31.939]  Well, um, I was just going to call in and, you know, just the state of affairs, everything that's going on in the world right now.
[01:50:32.299 --> 01:50:34.201]  Um, you know, I'm born again Christian.
[01:50:34.321 --> 01:50:37.844]  I, you know, I believe every word of the Bible and it is a spiritual warfare.
[01:50:37.984 --> 01:50:46.632]  You know, Ephesians 6, 10, it quite clearly states that, you know, between empties above us and it's all playing out, you know, on the stage.
[01:50:47.132 --> 01:50:53.958]  I do believe end times are imminent, you know, and I, you know, just really want to comment on that's the state of affairs at the minute.
[01:50:55.111 --> 01:50:55.471]  I agree.
[01:50:55.511 --> 01:50:57.413]  I noticed you said you wanted to talk about the Vegas shooting.
[01:50:57.773 --> 01:51:02.276]  Is it not incredible that now they admit the official story isn't true and won't say what happened?
[01:51:02.296 --> 01:51:07.760]  That's just... Notice it's leaving the news now as what we first reported as accurate.
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:09.601]  Absolutely, no.
[01:51:09.821 --> 01:51:13.744]  From day one, actually, I follow your show, you know, for probably last year and a half or so.
[01:51:13.764 --> 01:51:22.790]  I've been awake a lot longer, but just kind of got onto your show and I comment quite a bit on there and, you know, first moment I heard it, I was with my boys getting ready for school and I'm like,
[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:29.725]  I closed my eyes, because I'm a former Marine, and you can just hear the report of several weapons systems going off.
[01:51:29.945 --> 01:51:34.829]  And, you know, the official line is just, like I said, falling apart, it's been falling apart.
[01:51:34.889 --> 01:51:38.852]  And explain that to people as a weapons expert, and I've had world-renowned ones on.
[01:51:38.872 --> 01:51:44.936]  I mean, experts like that can say that's a that, that's a... I mean, you guys know, like, the voice of a gun.
[01:51:45.156 --> 01:51:51.341]  Just like car experts learn the noise of an engine, or what mufflers they've got, or what type of motorcycle it is.
[01:51:52.479 --> 01:51:52.980]  Absolutely.
[01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:56.746]  I was a grunt, actually, so I was really around a lot of different weapon systems.
[01:51:57.507 --> 01:52:03.736]  The initial assault rifle, I think it was, sounded very much like a 5.56 that was followed very, very quickly.
[01:52:04.177 --> 01:52:06.561]  And on top of it, I thought it was a belt-fed weapon.
[01:52:06.941 --> 01:52:07.622]  Maybe a SAW.
[01:52:08.323 --> 01:52:09.304]  Well, that's more news I've got.
[01:52:09.344 --> 01:52:14.846]  As we've talked to top acoustics experts and law enforcement, they say the bump stock thing is a complete red herring.
[01:52:25.418 --> 01:52:26.558]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:52:26.618 --> 01:52:44.706]  No doubt in my mind, from the very first moment I heard, and I'm three hours from Vegas, we have friends there at the concert, there's video, believe it or not, that's not been released yet, that people are trying to get it to the right hands, and so that was partly why I wanted to comment about that too, that clearly shows multiple shooters at different locations, and so
[01:52:45.727 --> 01:52:51.712]  Hopefully they are able to get that to the right people because I do believe the FBI is defunct.
[01:52:51.772 --> 01:52:54.074]  Let me tell you who the right people are.
[01:52:54.654 --> 01:52:55.355]  It's the people.
[01:52:55.415 --> 01:52:59.578]  They should load it directly to YouTube and say, here I am, this is what we saw.
[01:52:59.618 --> 01:53:00.879]  They should just not sit on it.
[01:53:01.239 --> 01:53:03.181]  They should just get it out to everybody.
[01:53:03.461 --> 01:53:04.342]  That's the right people.
[01:53:06.042 --> 01:53:18.489]  Alright, well, I guess that's the way to go, but I do believe people... Well, if you want us to put you on hold and give you my producer's number, so that if you want, I mean, we're happy to have him on or play the video.
[01:53:18.749 --> 01:53:26.333]  We've already got, as you know, a bombshell video of them saying police were shooting other folks that were shooting at them a mile away at the other hotels.
[01:53:26.854 --> 01:53:32.076]  You've got the reports of the different rifles for the first two and a half minutes clearly going on, so absolutely.
[01:53:33.477 --> 01:53:34.358]  I'll put you on hold.
[01:53:34.398 --> 01:53:37.660]  No pressure if you don't want to give us your info, but we'd love to talk to those people.
[01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:38.200]  God bless you.
[01:53:38.220 --> 01:53:39.681]  All right, let's get another caller in.
[01:53:39.701 --> 01:53:40.742]  I could talk to these callers all day.
[01:53:40.782 --> 01:53:41.362]  They're so smart.
[01:53:41.962 --> 01:53:43.683]  Let's talk to Kenny in Nebraska.
[01:53:43.703 --> 01:53:44.904]  Kenny, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:53:46.025 --> 01:53:46.685]  Oh, my pleasure.
[01:53:47.065 --> 01:53:48.866]  First, I want to say thanks for your products.
[01:53:48.926 --> 01:53:50.608]  I've been enjoying them for a while now.
[01:53:51.208 --> 01:54:01.874]  And technically, I was calling because, you know, you'd been talking about how the entertainment industry in particular has been used as a tool to basically brainwash people.
[01:54:03.667 --> 01:54:09.432]  Unfortunately, we haven't done a good job of using those tools for the other side, especially when it comes to music.
[01:54:10.273 --> 01:54:13.016]  Since the Dixie Chicks fiasco...
[01:54:13.945 --> 01:54:16.627]  You know, hardly anybody wants to touch anything political.
[01:54:16.647 --> 01:54:17.308]  Oh yeah, that's what they do.
[01:54:17.348 --> 01:54:21.972]  They say, we're going to destroy you just because you question any official government story.
[01:54:21.992 --> 01:54:27.037]  Because they'd seen some of my DVDs and they misrepresented it because I confirmed with them that's what happened.
[01:54:27.057 --> 01:54:27.757]  They were scared to come on.
[01:54:27.777 --> 01:54:28.598]  It was right here in Austin.
[01:54:29.119 --> 01:54:29.919]  They lived here at the time.
[01:54:29.959 --> 01:54:30.840]  They still do, some of them.
[01:54:31.361 --> 01:54:32.302]  And yeah, that's an example.
[01:54:32.342 --> 01:54:35.645]  They make an example out of one group, so everybody else shuts up.
[01:54:35.685 --> 01:54:36.085]  You know what?
[01:54:36.405 --> 01:54:38.087]  That intimidation doesn't work anymore, my friend.
[01:54:38.993 --> 01:54:42.455]  Yeah, well, unfortunately, it is still pretty prevalent in the music industry.
[01:54:42.536 --> 01:54:50.141]  I produce music, basically, you can call it Info Wars or Patriot music, and I have been for about the last four years.
[01:54:50.201 --> 01:55:01.669]  I work with a friend of mine that's a Nashville staff writer here in Omaha, and that's basically the feedback that I've gotten from him is he doesn't want to touch it with a 10-foot pole because, you know, of the potential
[01:55:02.526 --> 01:55:09.195]  And now with them shutting down Facebook and your opportunity to be able to promote your music personally, you know... Oh, absolutely!
[01:55:09.235 --> 01:55:14.722]  We got the whole evil mainstream media Hollywood globalist cabal on our back, brother.
[01:55:14.743 --> 01:55:15.363]  But here's the deal.
[01:55:15.924 --> 01:55:18.187]  Once we're awake and we know they're on our back...
[01:55:18.973 --> 01:55:22.736]  Just like a buck and bronco or a bull, they're not going to stay on our back forever.
[01:55:23.296 --> 01:55:28.240]  They can hold on for dear life, but they're never going to make the full eight seconds they want.
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:32.643]  But send me some information at ShowTipsAndFoolWars.com.
[01:55:33.144 --> 01:55:42.611]  I'm more and more, Millie Weaver had this idea, I do have this idea years ago as well, smart folks have the same ideas, to have some music shows that are specifically to highlight
[01:55:43.573 --> 01:55:44.654]  Independent new music.
[01:55:45.134 --> 01:55:54.159]  The problem is you run into their producers and then other stuff and it's a minefield and so anything that's kind of Hollywood-y, and I appreciate your call, Kenny, just gets a little weird.
[01:55:54.719 --> 01:55:59.342]  And so that's why, you know, it's hard for us to ever promote stuff or get involved, but I'm sure you're great.
[01:56:00.042 --> 01:56:07.306]  But, you know, there's so much great Patriot music online and a lot of it gets millions of views, millions of listens, it just doesn't get Hollywood recognition.
[01:56:07.687 --> 01:56:08.487]  But you don't need that.
[01:56:08.507 --> 01:56:11.369]  If you're playing to a crowd of 100 people about the truth,
[01:56:11.829 --> 01:56:16.290]  You know, and, you know, sell 5,000, you know, songs or DVDs or CCDs.
[01:56:16.610 --> 01:56:17.090]  You're winning.
[01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:21.431]  But it is about everybody supporting the media that they think is helping the world.
[01:56:21.751 --> 01:56:26.273]  Just like InfoWars, 50% off right now on our great brain pill.

[01:56:39.838 --> 01:56:41.919]  And at 50% off, it's really discounted.

[01:57:00.866 --> 01:57:01.707]  Those two go together.
[01:57:02.947 --> 01:57:06.248]  The Survival Shield X2 and the Bio-True Selenium are both essential.
[01:57:06.288 --> 01:57:07.889]  Without those, you die.
[01:57:08.089 --> 01:57:14.972]  And there's a lot of deficiency of true selenium, that is organically plant-derived selenium, and of deep-earth crystal source ionine.
[01:57:15.072 --> 01:57:16.933]  It's actually absorbable into the body.

[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:56.381]  The bone broth.
[01:57:57.062 --> 01:57:58.603]  The bone broth.
[01:57:58.823 --> 01:58:00.164]  The bone broth.
[01:58:00.224 --> 01:58:00.965]  The bone broth.
[01:58:01.265 --> 01:58:02.406]  The bone broth.
[01:58:02.666 --> 01:58:03.447]  The bone broth.
[01:58:03.967 --> 01:58:05.569]  Well, now it's the next level of that.
[01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:06.329]  It's caveman.
[01:58:07.050 --> 01:58:08.411]  Hey, I need a glass of caveman.
[01:58:08.772 --> 01:58:09.272]  Caveman.
[01:58:09.832 --> 01:58:10.093]  Mmm.
[01:58:10.513 --> 01:58:10.733]  Mmm.
[01:58:11.214 --> 01:58:11.834]  Mmm, man.
[01:58:11.914 --> 01:58:12.154]  Mmm.
[01:58:12.535 --> 01:58:13.476]  It's better than Ovaltine.
[01:58:13.696 --> 01:58:14.637]  Better than Ovaltine.
[01:58:14.717 --> 01:58:14.837]  Mmm.
[01:58:15.097 --> 01:58:16.237]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:58:16.677 --> 01:58:17.458]  It's unbelievable.
[01:58:18.178 --> 01:58:19.818]  Caveman is just over the top.
[01:58:20.319 --> 01:58:21.899]  What in the world?
[01:58:22.079 --> 01:58:24.980]  But now with the milk, I was like, whoa, this has milk in it.
[01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:27.041]  It tastes like good.
[01:58:27.361 --> 01:58:28.221]  Man, this tastes so good.
[01:58:29.441 --> 01:58:30.622]  Tastes like the best milkshake ever.
[01:58:31.722 --> 01:58:33.082]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:58:33.142 --> 01:58:34.463]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:58:34.543 --> 01:58:35.883]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:58:36.043 --> 01:58:36.803]  Like good.
[01:58:36.823 --> 01:58:38.684]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:58:38.744 --> 01:58:40.084]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:58:40.124 --> 01:58:41.265]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:58:41.325 --> 01:58:41.765]  Like good.
[01:58:44.275 --> 01:58:50.942]  I can say without a doubt, at least in my experience, this is a super home run available at Infowarslife.com and it supports the broadcast.
[01:58:51.062 --> 01:58:52.644]  Alright, all the big news straight ahead.
[01:58:53.064 --> 01:58:57.268]  Men, give your body the support it needs with Infowars Life Prostagard.
[01:58:57.789 --> 01:59:01.853]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.
[01:59:02.213 --> 01:59:12.882]  InfoWars Life has set out to bring you formulations that are not only the highest quality out there, but formulas that you can use on a daily basis to give your body the natural herbs and extracts that our experts recommend.
[01:59:13.442 --> 01:59:21.209]  The Prostagard formula does just that, with its mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants that help give your body total support.
[01:59:21.409 --> 01:59:26.353]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols,
[01:59:26.873 --> 01:59:27.893]  We're good to go.
[01:59:54.406 --> 02:00:00.348]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.751 --> 02:00:17.953]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.943 --> 02:00:23.964]  Man, these calls have been great.
[02:00:24.024 --> 02:00:24.964]  We gotta take more calls.
[02:00:25.304 --> 02:00:25.984]  We've been doing it!
[02:00:27.864 --> 02:00:31.865]  I got into work a little bit late today, dealing with a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:00:32.586 --> 02:00:33.606]  The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[02:00:36.066 --> 02:00:42.988]  And I just cannot believe that they're now admitting the official Vegas story isn't true.
[02:00:44.928 --> 02:00:47.189]  They're really walking it all back now, aren't they?
[02:00:50.570 --> 02:00:51.290]  And I noticed,
[02:00:53.271 --> 02:01:08.696]  They went from probably, let's not exaggerate, a hundred publications or more a day lying about me, saying the shooting never happened, or saying there were multiple shooters, or saying, you know, things I did say, things I didn't say, to just basically almost nothing.
[02:01:10.657 --> 02:01:19.680]  They had the New York Times put out something that a bunch of people followed, and a bunch of other media folks copied, but you could tell they are really weak.
[02:01:21.513 --> 02:01:23.154]  And they're waiting for the other shoe to drop.
[02:01:23.174 --> 02:01:27.536]  Because they made their own phone calls, their own sources, their own moles.
[02:01:28.497 --> 02:01:32.319]  Like the guy running the FBI in Vegas, our sources say is as bad as it gets.
[02:01:33.439 --> 02:01:39.122]  And they said, yeah, you might want to stop saying that about Jones being a liar, because we're not going to be able to contain it.
[02:01:40.523 --> 02:01:42.884]  They may make up some whole new story, but they know.
[02:01:43.965 --> 02:01:46.726]  They knew before the body was cold and other bodies were cold who did it.
[02:01:50.788 --> 02:01:58.590]  It's heartening to know there's good people in the FBI, but those are the people that actually live in the real world and pull triggers.
[02:01:59.330 --> 02:02:11.114]  The little politico coneheads up on top are just a click of social climbing yes-men, and they'll do anything.
[02:02:13.734 --> 02:02:16.355]  So yeah, if you just joined us, I'm going back to your phone calls.
[02:02:17.275 --> 02:02:19.336]  Don Salazar's article is on newswars.com.
[02:02:21.044 --> 02:02:25.791]  And it links the Associated Press saying the casino owner says the official story is not true.
[02:02:25.811 --> 02:02:34.364]  And he, you know, the guy shot other people beforehand.
[02:02:34.524 --> 02:02:35.446]  Everything we've been telling you.
[02:02:36.826 --> 02:02:38.688]  And he wants the Middle East, just like we first told you.
[02:02:38.728 --> 02:02:41.592]  I mean, everything our sources told you.
[02:02:42.013 --> 02:02:50.463]  We're just crazy enough, when the Secret Service says she's got a black ambulance, and is having convulsions every 45 minutes, just give me details.
[02:02:50.503 --> 02:02:51.344]  What does she have?
[02:02:51.364 --> 02:02:52.085]  Alex, don't worry about it.
[02:02:52.646 --> 02:02:54.528]  Just tell your audience to follow her around.
[02:02:54.769 --> 02:02:55.590]  You'll get her on tape.
[02:02:56.716 --> 02:02:59.858]  And a month later, she fell flat on her face, having a convulsion.
[02:03:00.318 --> 02:03:07.082]  A week before, Billy Weaver and Gavin Wentz caught her collapsing inside a tent for an hour at one of her events with guys with medical stretchers.
[02:03:07.142 --> 02:03:13.266]  I mean... She's got a really tortured life.
[02:03:13.286 --> 02:03:16.248]  I mean, they gotta roll her out quick, drugged up, roll her back out.
[02:03:20.003 --> 02:03:22.805]  Our sources don't want to violate federal law and give you medical records.
[02:03:22.825 --> 02:03:29.570]  They just said, Alex, people get brain tumors and people have them removed in 2013, but a lot of times they come back.
[02:03:32.332 --> 02:03:34.653]  Hell, they might say John McCain doesn't have a brain tumor.
[02:03:36.054 --> 02:03:36.975]  That might be the next thing.
[02:03:38.216 --> 02:03:40.818]  So we broke that.
[02:03:47.202 --> 02:03:51.083]  And yeah, the Secret Service wanted Trump to win, because Hillary and everybody treats him like crap.
[02:03:57.585 --> 02:03:58.905]  But it's the same thing.
[02:03:58.965 --> 02:04:00.065]  I mean, these are real sources.
[02:04:01.045 --> 02:04:04.466]  And now the sources have been proven super accurate.
[02:04:05.927 --> 02:04:09.567]  It just gets a little creepy when they call up and say, now answer our question.
[02:04:09.607 --> 02:04:11.708]  How did you say they're going to attack at 10 o'clock at night?
[02:04:13.413 --> 02:04:14.614]  And I'm like, I don't remember that.
[02:04:15.274 --> 02:04:22.217]  And they're like, no, here's the, oh, I just meant like, that'd be a good time to attack a big crowd, you know, during police shift changes.
[02:04:22.237 --> 02:04:23.737]  And that's, that's how I do it.
[02:04:23.777 --> 02:04:29.080]  And they don't think I'm involved or anything.
[02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:34.242]  It's just, it's just, this is getting too weird for me.
[02:04:34.382 --> 02:04:34.682]  Okay.
[02:04:34.822 --> 02:04:37.263]  I mean, this is getting really weird at this point.
[02:04:38.524 --> 02:04:40.306]  But I just love the media saying we made it up.
[02:04:40.566 --> 02:05:01.665]  What I'm just going to get on air and say, the hostage rescue team told us that they shot him and he didn't do it, now that's coming out, and that they shot other people before and the official story's not true, and that there was, uh, he went to the Middle East and there was all this paraphernalia there and all this anti-fan Islamic stuff and, I mean, that really happened.
[02:05:03.655 --> 02:05:12.342]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[02:05:12.402 --> 02:05:12.882]  That's right.
[02:05:12.942 --> 02:05:17.946]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[02:05:18.206 --> 02:05:24.691]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use.
[02:05:24.891 --> 02:05:32.137]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[02:05:32.517 --> 02:05:32.637]  Woo!
[02:05:32.697 --> 02:05:33.618]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:05:33.738 --> 02:05:42.345]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:05:42.485 --> 02:05:51.713]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:05:52.073 --> 02:05:55.396]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[02:05:55.516 --> 02:05:59.459]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[02:05:59.639 --> 02:06:00.500]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:02.741]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:02.821 --> 02:06:11.405]  Big Brother.
[02:06:12.765 --> 02:06:14.026]  Mainstream media.
[02:06:15.566 --> 02:06:16.687]  Government cover us.
[02:06:18.147 --> 02:06:19.088]  You want answers?
[02:06:20.068 --> 02:06:21.769]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:21.989 --> 02:06:28.272]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:34.187 --> 02:06:37.789]  I've been watching, and I've been waiting.
[02:06:37.829 --> 02:06:38.809]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:06:42.411 --> 02:06:47.874]  We're gonna go to Josh, Jesse, Dave, Andy, Kelly, and many others.
[02:06:48.094 --> 02:06:52.817]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[02:06:53.297 --> 02:07:00.721]  First-time callers today, as we normally do, so new folks get a chance to get on board and give us your view, your take on things.
[02:07:02.345 --> 02:07:12.524]  Hungary's leaders have come out with documents that are public about how the EU and George Soros plan to overthrow the entire European system to make it Islamic.
[02:07:13.682 --> 02:07:17.125]  Uh, as a, uh, attack on Christianity.
[02:07:17.445 --> 02:07:18.326]  Because they're Satanists.
[02:07:18.826 --> 02:07:26.512]  And the government now is issuing emergency reports to the public, detailing the Satanism of George Soros, his son, and the rest of their family.
[02:07:26.532 --> 02:07:28.734]  And there are photos of his son at satanic rituals.
[02:07:29.515 --> 02:07:32.657]  Uh, so, you see, just suddenly everybody's going all the way.
[02:07:33.418 --> 02:07:34.078]  Sounds insane?
[02:07:34.398 --> 02:07:35.439]  Well, they are devil worshippers.
[02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:37.621]  So, it's on.
[02:07:41.018 --> 02:07:42.759]  So that article's at newswars.com.
[02:07:43.079 --> 02:07:45.020]  Hungary declares Soros an agent of Satan.
[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:50.202]  Hungarians battling former Nazi asset at spiritual level.
[02:07:51.322 --> 02:07:51.742]  Dan Lyman.
[02:07:53.223 --> 02:07:58.805]  See, as soon as we figure out it's spiritual, we stop losing, we start winning.
[02:07:59.405 --> 02:08:06.128]  The minute we run back to Jesus Christ, for real, not virtue signaling like these fake churches.
[02:08:08.206 --> 02:08:16.433]  The minute we go back to Christ, the minute the hedge goes back up, the success, the providence, all of it goes back up.
[02:08:17.674 --> 02:08:26.261]  The globalists are constantly, just drop God and let us teach your kids and go along with us and let Mr. Weinstein be your boss and everything will be okay.
[02:08:26.301 --> 02:08:30.524]  Here's Pennywise the clown, he's gonna take good care of you, he'll take care of your kids.
[02:08:31.765 --> 02:08:35.989]  The minute you say no to these vampires, they run for the hills screaming.
[02:08:38.044 --> 02:08:39.165]  Back to where they came from.
[02:08:39.185 --> 02:08:48.193]  So we're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[02:08:52.336 --> 02:08:58.722]  And then coming up the start of the next segment, powerful new video that Darren McGreen put together titled
[02:09:00.407 --> 02:09:02.108]  Hollywood's message to Donald Trump.
[02:09:02.468 --> 02:09:05.409]  And remember, when they say Donald Trump, they mean you.
[02:09:06.329 --> 02:09:09.590]  And I'm not trying to get you to identify yourself personally as Trump.
[02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:13.252]  The enemy, when they see NRA, they think gun owner.
[02:09:13.452 --> 02:09:21.154]  When they see Trump, they think average American, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, that wants freedom.
[02:09:22.695 --> 02:09:28.357]  Now I say, don't just put all your eggs in Trump's basket, or all your eggs in Infowars' basket, or all your eggs
[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:35.381]  In the NRA's basket, because I could be killed, Trump could be compromised, killed, the NRA could be overtaken, this board destroyed.
[02:09:35.741 --> 02:09:37.202]  Believe me, they've been after him behind the scenes.
[02:09:37.322 --> 02:09:38.902]  They've not been successful.
[02:09:44.404 --> 02:09:45.864]  But you gotta trust in God.
[02:09:46.224 --> 02:09:47.324]  You gotta trust in your gut.
[02:09:47.344 --> 02:09:49.325]  You gotta trust yourself.
[02:09:51.385 --> 02:09:56.867]  You start trusting in your own good wits and the sense God gave you,
[02:09:58.444 --> 02:10:00.185]  The sense God gave you, that's God.
[02:10:01.546 --> 02:10:02.186]  That discernment.
[02:10:04.908 --> 02:10:06.289]  The enemy's easy to beat at that point.
[02:10:06.929 --> 02:10:14.414]  That's why they hate us so much, folks, because they know we're hundreds of times better, stronger, faster.
[02:10:15.415 --> 02:10:16.375]  We just don't seek power.
[02:10:18.857 --> 02:10:25.481]  That's why these spiritual midgets hate our guts.
[02:10:27.102 --> 02:10:28.023]  Because you're strong.
[02:10:30.117 --> 02:10:31.858]  That's why they target the people that are strong.
[02:10:32.239 --> 02:10:34.280]  Any group you see being oppressed is because they're strong.
[02:10:37.623 --> 02:10:40.966]  And because they're the next target for takedown.
[02:10:42.727 --> 02:10:54.537]  The globalists have taken down most of the groups, and now there's one bastion halfway left in the globalist's mind, in Hollywood's mind, and that's the Midwest.
[02:10:54.637 --> 02:10:59.581]  And they say it's white, because they don't want to get people to fight with each other, but it's just, they mean Christian.
[02:11:04.872 --> 02:11:09.854]  And they've got a message for you of hate and despair and of curses.
[02:11:10.754 --> 02:11:20.777]  Why not, just like Mike Pence did, just get up in that Colts 49ers game when two guys did their kneeling and all the rest of it and just walk out?
[02:11:20.797 --> 02:11:22.317]  Because you know what?
[02:11:22.377 --> 02:11:27.019]  Those thugs, those little nobodies, they need you.
[02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:30.440]  You don't need them.
[02:11:33.291 --> 02:11:41.276]  And that simple act of coming out of Babylon brings this system to its knees.
[02:11:42.396 --> 02:11:42.897]  So do it!
[02:11:44.898 --> 02:11:46.019]  Use the power you got.
[02:11:46.499 --> 02:11:47.599]  Shop with the good guys.
[02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:50.081]  Promote the patriots locally and nationally.
[02:11:52.182 --> 02:12:00.127]  Support the good little church that's telling the truth, not the big mega one that looks so nice and makes you feel so good and there's all these neat people to meet.
[02:12:01.428 --> 02:12:04.190]  I mean, all these big megachurches are swinger clubs.
[02:12:04.631 --> 02:12:05.412]  You know that, right?
[02:12:06.332 --> 02:12:09.755]  You want to go pick a woman up, just like that, go to a megachurch.
[02:12:10.356 --> 02:12:12.037]  You want to go swinging, that's where you go.
[02:12:14.459 --> 02:12:15.921]  Folks, I'm not saying that to be mean.
[02:12:16.481 --> 02:12:18.023]  Everybody that goes to them knows that.
[02:12:19.664 --> 02:12:20.285]  Or they're stupid.
[02:12:22.306 --> 02:12:23.147]  They're country clubs.
[02:12:25.729 --> 02:12:26.290]  They're not real.
[02:12:27.981 --> 02:12:29.321]  They're people that want to hedge their bets.
[02:12:29.341 --> 02:12:31.722]  You know, they say Hillary Clinton goes to Christian church.
[02:12:33.143 --> 02:12:34.783]  Doesn't really pray to God, but just goes.
[02:12:34.823 --> 02:12:36.944]  And then also goes voodoo stuff, devil worship.
[02:12:37.204 --> 02:12:39.004]  She says she doesn't even know what's real.
[02:12:39.384 --> 02:12:40.285]  She's such a robot.
[02:12:40.625 --> 02:12:42.205]  She's just betting.
[02:12:42.285 --> 02:12:43.266]  She's just hoping.
[02:12:43.346 --> 02:12:45.386]  She's just in the dark.
[02:12:46.927 --> 02:12:50.068]  Aren't you glad you're not that spiritually cut off?
[02:12:53.769 --> 02:12:54.749]  John in New York.
[02:12:55.509 --> 02:12:56.610]  You've been holding a long time.
[02:12:56.650 --> 02:12:57.170]  Thanks for holding.
[02:12:57.190 --> 02:12:57.470]  Go ahead.
[02:12:59.022 --> 02:13:00.122]  You say John or Josh?
[02:13:01.023 --> 02:13:02.103]  Josh, I apologize.
[02:13:02.143 --> 02:13:03.604]  I told him to move that screen closer.
[02:13:03.624 --> 02:13:04.344]  I can hardly read it.
[02:13:04.364 --> 02:13:04.704]  Go ahead.
[02:13:05.505 --> 02:13:06.045]  It's alright.
[02:13:06.065 --> 02:13:06.925]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:13:07.025 --> 02:13:07.525]  Good to talk to you.
[02:13:07.545 --> 02:13:07.846]  Good, brother.
[02:13:07.866 --> 02:13:08.346]  Thanks for holding.
[02:13:09.226 --> 02:13:09.666]  Quick question.
[02:13:09.686 --> 02:13:14.548]  Before I get to my question, I just want to say that Harvey Weinstein tape, that is the creepiest thing I've ever heard in my life.
[02:13:15.429 --> 02:13:20.771]  Didn't it sound like it's a clown trying to get Georgie into the, stick his arm in the drainage ditch?
[02:13:21.651 --> 02:13:22.491]  It really did.
[02:13:22.631 --> 02:13:25.312]  I just can't believe how these people would actually talk to somebody like that.
[02:13:25.332 --> 02:13:26.273]  It's just amazing to me.
[02:13:27.850 --> 02:13:34.434]  Well, I had Hollywood, a bunch of big names, and the system tried to get me involved, and I was like, no thank you.
[02:13:34.454 --> 02:13:37.235]  Nah, it's just really weird out there.
[02:13:38.075 --> 02:13:39.296]  I like staying out in the country.
[02:13:39.356 --> 02:13:41.517]  I'm in New York, but I'm in the country too, so.
[02:13:42.218 --> 02:13:43.758]  Hey, the New York country's beautiful.
[02:13:43.778 --> 02:13:44.899]  Some of the prettiest places in the world.
[02:13:46.454 --> 02:13:46.674]  Oh yeah.
[02:13:46.894 --> 02:13:50.956]  So my question for you is, I've noticed, and I've been looking around online and stuff, and I can't find this.
[02:13:51.456 --> 02:13:55.978]  Right after the shooting, before the bodies were even cold, they started saying it's the biggest mass shooting in U.S.
[02:13:56.018 --> 02:13:56.378]  history.
[02:13:56.699 --> 02:14:00.040]  Do you know yourself how many people were actually shot of the dead and injured?
[02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:04.402]  Yeah, it was 500 plus and it was 59 dead.
[02:14:04.422 --> 02:14:06.003]  It was 58, now it's 59 dead.
[02:14:06.983 --> 02:14:10.785]  But truly, I mean, if you want to call it mass shooting of people unarmed, it would be wounded knee.
[02:14:11.225 --> 02:14:12.346]  That was as high as 300.
[02:14:12.946 --> 02:14:15.067]  So it's the biggest mass shooting in modern history.
[02:14:15.950 --> 02:14:19.971]  Well what I was asking was, of the injured and the dead, were all of them shootings?
[02:14:20.071 --> 02:14:23.512]  I don't see it all being shootings with the way the crowd was running out, you know what I mean?
[02:14:24.472 --> 02:14:29.874]  Oh yeah, I mean, remember the famous Rolling Stones concert?
[02:14:30.734 --> 02:14:38.916]  Where hundreds of people got trampled, a bunch of folks died, one person got stabbed and somebody got shot, then the crowd stampeded and that killed.
[02:14:39.296 --> 02:14:41.136]  How many folks did that Rolling Stone deal?
[02:14:41.637 --> 02:14:42.797]  Wasn't that out in Nevada too?
[02:14:44.361 --> 02:14:47.282]  It was Altamont, I believe, even though the Hells Angels were the security guard.
[02:14:47.782 --> 02:14:48.882]  I think that's the one you're referring to.
[02:14:49.623 --> 02:14:51.883]  Yep, the Hells Angels were the security guard.
[02:14:51.903 --> 02:14:52.543]  So where is that?
[02:14:53.744 --> 02:14:54.164]  Altamont?
[02:14:54.184 --> 02:14:55.324]  I'm not sure what state that was in.
[02:14:55.364 --> 02:14:57.085]  I know the name of the concert was Altamont.
[02:14:58.005 --> 02:15:01.006]  Yeah, look up the Rolling Stones... There it is.
[02:15:01.046 --> 02:15:02.866]  The Rolling Stones Disaster at Altamont.
[02:15:03.346 --> 02:15:06.687]  Let It Bleed was the name of the album.
[02:15:07.308 --> 02:15:09.368]  Where is Altamont based?
[02:15:10.248 --> 02:15:10.829]  California.
[02:15:11.169 --> 02:15:12.229]  It's high desert though, isn't it?
[02:15:15.261 --> 02:15:15.601]  All right.
[02:15:15.621 --> 02:15:16.141]  Well, thank you.
[02:15:16.161 --> 02:15:18.602]  It was California, not that.
[02:15:18.962 --> 02:15:20.343]  Really good points, Josh.
[02:15:20.403 --> 02:15:20.863]  Anything else?
[02:15:20.883 --> 02:15:22.463]  That's it, man.
[02:15:22.483 --> 02:15:23.424]  Keep up the good work, brother.
[02:15:23.704 --> 02:15:24.084]  Thank you.
[02:15:24.544 --> 02:15:29.526]  We're going to come back, intro this short video, and then go right to Dave in St.
[02:15:29.606 --> 02:15:36.628]  Louis, Andy in Indiana, Kelly in Wisconsin, and then Jesse in Tennessee and others.
[02:15:38.490 --> 02:15:39.270]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:15:39.591 --> 02:15:40.871]  This is the InfoWars.
[02:15:41.392 --> 02:15:45.414]  This is one incredible time to be alive, and you're not a spectator.
[02:15:46.194 --> 02:15:50.016]  You are a soldier on the field, whether you like it or not.
[02:15:50.556 --> 02:15:51.757]  So please spread those links.
[02:15:52.237 --> 02:15:57.460]  NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and InfoWars.com.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:15:59.181]  You are the resistance.
[02:16:02.843 --> 02:16:04.384]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[02:16:05.652 --> 02:16:10.975]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[02:16:11.235 --> 02:16:12.356]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[02:16:12.616 --> 02:16:14.917]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[02:16:15.578 --> 02:16:22.101]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[02:16:22.302 --> 02:16:25.643]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[02:16:25.964 --> 02:16:27.765]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[02:16:28.405 --> 02:16:36.814]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[02:16:36.855 --> 02:16:37.816]  They know how great it is.
[02:16:38.737 --> 02:16:42.541]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[02:16:43.342 --> 02:16:44.783]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[02:16:45.604 --> 02:16:53.487]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.

[02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:05.371]  That comes to $50.03.
[02:17:05.511 --> 02:17:09.552]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[02:17:09.972 --> 02:17:12.873]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[02:17:15.274 --> 02:17:16.155]  It's a good deal at $39.

[02:18:36.616 --> 02:18:37.257]  Concentrate.
[02:18:37.277 --> 02:18:39.058]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[02:18:39.338 --> 02:18:40.759]  Next level compared to whey.
[02:18:40.959 --> 02:18:42.601]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[02:18:43.021 --> 02:18:43.882]  It's incredible.
[02:18:44.362 --> 02:18:46.283]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[02:18:46.464 --> 02:18:48.405]  It's bigger than I am already at 15.
[02:18:48.505 --> 02:18:48.965]  Incredible.
[02:18:49.286 --> 02:18:50.186]  It is amazing.
[02:18:50.547 --> 02:18:51.828]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:18:52.248 --> 02:18:53.369]  50% off Caveman.
[02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:54.910]  But only a few days left.
[02:18:55.170 --> 02:18:55.911]  It's about to end.
[02:18:56.511 --> 02:18:58.852]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[02:18:59.273 --> 02:19:04.455]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[02:19:04.876 --> 02:19:06.276]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[02:19:06.516 --> 02:19:07.677]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[02:19:08.057 --> 02:19:08.878]  I want to thank you.
[02:19:09.198 --> 02:19:10.258]  We're all in this together.
[02:19:10.779 --> 02:19:20.684]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[02:19:26.889 --> 02:19:36.817]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[02:19:37.078 --> 02:19:42.422]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[02:20:29.706 --> 02:20:33.708]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, or what I call InfoWars Live.
[02:20:35.329 --> 02:20:38.511]  We're now on air 10 hours a day live, day to night, 8 a.m.
[02:20:40.132 --> 02:20:40.712]  to 11 a.m.
[02:20:40.732 --> 02:20:44.134]  when I go live here at the same studios in Austin, Texas.
[02:20:44.294 --> 02:20:52.719]  And then Owen Schroeder comes on at 3 o'clock Central with the War Room with all the great contributors that are part of that transmission as well.
[02:20:53.940 --> 02:20:55.881]  You know, I think we really should have a
[02:20:58.931 --> 02:21:02.892]  Hollywood Rapes America Contest.
[02:21:05.353 --> 02:21:12.815]  Mike Cernovich called me last night or texted me and said we should have, just like my Bill Clinton's a rapist contest that was so successful because of you out there taking action.
[02:21:12.875 --> 02:21:13.535]  Change the world.
[02:21:14.856 --> 02:21:15.636]  Change this country.
[02:21:15.676 --> 02:21:16.336]  Change the planet.
[02:21:16.976 --> 02:21:19.057]  Change our future trajectory for the better.
[02:21:19.677 --> 02:21:19.977]  Clearly.
[02:21:23.905 --> 02:21:26.907]  He said you ought to have a... Weinstein's a rapist.
[02:21:27.408 --> 02:21:29.789]  Harvey Weinstein's a rapist.
[02:21:30.069 --> 02:21:33.412]  $1,000 prize for anybody that says it to any major Hollywood star.
[02:21:34.172 --> 02:21:37.715]  Maybe $4,000 or $5,000 for those directly affiliated with Weinstein.
[02:21:40.017 --> 02:21:41.558]  Or on any national television show.
[02:21:43.139 --> 02:21:45.781]  And just how about Hollywood rapes America?
[02:21:48.323 --> 02:21:50.204]  How about Hollywood rapes America?
[02:21:52.318 --> 02:21:55.020]  Cernovich has got his hashtag boycott Hollywood, that's good.
[02:21:56.101 --> 02:21:59.224]  Daria put out on Real Alex Jones, Hollywood is dead.
[02:21:59.244 --> 02:22:02.587]  Hashtag Hollywood is dead.
[02:22:02.607 --> 02:22:05.909]  And they've been dead for a long time, but they tried to kill America.
[02:22:06.670 --> 02:22:10.874]  They had to tell us how to be moral and let them sexualize our children.
[02:22:12.489 --> 02:22:14.390]  And we sat there and went along with it.
[02:22:14.931 --> 02:22:17.333]  And the NFL wanted to sit there and lecture everybody.
[02:22:17.793 --> 02:22:18.774]  And use divisiveness.
[02:22:19.554 --> 02:22:21.656]  Your reign of bullying and terror is over.
[02:22:21.956 --> 02:22:26.340]  And just because you idiots haven't figured it out yet, doesn't mean it isn't the case!
[02:22:28.180 --> 02:22:31.343]  I'm not like you that just declares things to act like we're in charge.
[02:22:31.563 --> 02:22:31.763]  No.
[02:22:32.764 --> 02:22:34.325]  I only declare something when it's true.
[02:22:35.466 --> 02:22:42.752]  And most of America of every race, color, and creed, we're all one race, red blood, created by God, know you're of the enemy.
[02:22:44.273 --> 02:22:46.215]  And are sick of Bill Clinton and all of you people.
[02:22:47.876 --> 02:22:49.437]  Soulless servants of Satan.
[02:22:50.318 --> 02:22:54.922]  There you see Weinstein trying to crowd in in a photo with Trump.
[02:22:58.305 --> 02:23:01.887]  And I'm not saying Trump's perfect, but he's at war with Hollywood and they're at war with him.
[02:23:01.907 --> 02:23:03.428]  And what's that tell you?
[02:23:03.468 --> 02:23:08.171]  That tell you he was Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus?
[02:23:08.191 --> 02:23:10.252]  I don't think he was as bad as Saul.
[02:23:11.213 --> 02:23:13.154]  But he's definitely been hit by the thunderbolt.
[02:23:13.974 --> 02:23:14.875]  And the enemy knows it.
[02:23:16.276 --> 02:23:17.316]  They know he's a new man.
[02:23:17.977 --> 02:23:18.557]  On a mission.
[02:23:19.057 --> 02:23:19.698]  Fatalistic.
[02:23:20.458 --> 02:23:21.899]  And that's why they've got this message.
[02:23:22.659 --> 02:23:24.000]  For Donald J. Trump.
[02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:25.141]  Here's Hollywood's message.
[02:23:30.731 --> 02:23:31.451]  He's not a tough guy.
[02:23:31.471 --> 02:23:32.932]  He's a bully and he's a bitch.
[02:23:33.072 --> 02:23:33.752]  He's a punk.
[02:23:34.753 --> 02:23:35.493]  He's a dog.
[02:23:35.813 --> 02:23:37.014]  He's a pig.
[02:23:37.154 --> 02:23:38.754]  And he can suck my f***ing a**.
[02:23:38.954 --> 02:23:41.395]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[02:23:41.595 --> 02:23:45.657]  I'll meet him in a hotel room every motherf***ing day of the week and give him a Louisville slugger.
[02:23:45.677 --> 02:23:47.078]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[02:23:47.398 --> 02:23:51.640]  Kiss my motherf***ing a**, you bitch, punk, t*** sucker.
[02:24:00.572 --> 02:24:08.722]  Pointing what appears to be a water gun at the image of President Donald Trump projected on a whiteboard, our teacher Pale Modi has now been seen by countless viewers across the internet.
[02:24:08.762 --> 02:24:09.203]  Yes!
[02:24:10.304 --> 02:24:14.950]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[02:24:17.172 --> 02:24:23.397]  It's an actor dressed to look just like President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
[02:24:23.597 --> 02:24:32.424]  Pictures and video depicting comedian Kathy Griffin holding the bloody decapitated head of President Trump are no joking matter for the Secret Service.
[02:24:32.484 --> 02:24:38.549]  The rhetoric that has inspired the violence has come from the mainstream of the Democratic Party.
[02:24:38.689 --> 02:24:43.854]  They're involved in the coup, an active attempt to start a bloody civil war.
[02:24:58.193 --> 02:25:02.716]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:25:03.476 --> 02:25:03.977]  And they're scared.
[02:25:04.037 --> 02:25:05.738]  That's why they call themselves the resistance now.
[02:25:05.858 --> 02:25:07.419]  Plagiarists, frauds all.
[02:25:07.439 --> 02:25:08.540]  We're going right back to your calls.
[02:25:11.342 --> 02:25:15.125]  But understand, they're all teleprompter readers.
[02:25:15.265 --> 02:25:16.286]  They're all script readers.
[02:25:16.986 --> 02:25:20.509]  So Hollywood reads what the moguls, what the elites that own Hollywood want.
[02:25:21.049 --> 02:25:25.733]  What the communist Chinese and the Islamists that together control Hollywood.
[02:25:28.547 --> 02:25:28.907]  That's right.
[02:25:31.128 --> 02:25:33.989]  The sellout scum in Hollywood, completely sold out.
[02:25:35.549 --> 02:25:38.850]  And then Soros even got caught wanting to overthrow Israel itself.
[02:25:41.031 --> 02:25:44.412]  And I only say that because I'm not a defender of Israel, I'm not a hater of Israel.
[02:25:44.852 --> 02:25:47.993]  It's a complex country just like America, and decadent just like we are.
[02:25:49.393 --> 02:25:50.013]  Big problems.
[02:25:50.914 --> 02:25:51.694]  I don't hate Israel.
[02:25:52.807 --> 02:25:53.968]  But it's so much more complex.
[02:25:53.988 --> 02:26:04.456]  You have the Arabs and China controlling Hollywood and a bunch of rich, Israel-hating, leftist Jews selling out to it.
[02:26:06.077 --> 02:26:12.481]  And then the Soros documents are how they're going to overthrow Israel and America and side with the Muslims?
[02:26:14.683 --> 02:26:16.725]  The most radical forms of Islam?
[02:26:16.745 --> 02:26:18.426]  That's the real battlescape!
[02:26:19.991 --> 02:26:20.971]  That's the real players.
[02:26:21.031 --> 02:26:22.012]  The corrupt Vatican.
[02:26:22.552 --> 02:26:23.632]  Hijacked by the globalists.
[02:26:25.633 --> 02:26:26.573]  The corrupt EU.
[02:26:27.033 --> 02:26:27.853]  Saudi Arabia.
[02:26:28.213 --> 02:26:29.113]  Wahhabism.
[02:26:29.274 --> 02:26:30.314]  Allied with Hollywood.
[02:26:30.354 --> 02:26:31.054]  Mainstream media.
[02:26:32.374 --> 02:26:34.115]  I said I'd go to your calls and I didn't in this segment.
[02:26:34.135 --> 02:26:35.215]  I'm a bad person.
[02:26:37.456 --> 02:26:38.376]  Who's been on the longest here?
[02:26:38.396 --> 02:26:38.916]  I'll get to one.
[02:26:39.376 --> 02:26:40.056]  Dave in St.
[02:26:40.096 --> 02:26:40.357]  Louis.
[02:26:40.377 --> 02:26:41.237]  You're on the air.
[02:26:41.257 --> 02:26:41.717]  What do you think?
[02:26:43.657 --> 02:26:44.118]  Hey Alex.
[02:26:44.138 --> 02:26:44.878]  First time caller.
[02:26:45.318 --> 02:26:45.898]  Appreciate it.
[02:26:46.178 --> 02:26:46.678]  Welcome.
[02:26:47.779 --> 02:26:49.299]  My take on everything is
[02:26:50.464 --> 02:26:52.765]  With the hotel shooting, I don't know.
[02:26:52.805 --> 02:26:53.985]  I've stayed in hotels before.
[02:26:54.025 --> 02:26:56.166]  I've heard people above me and I've heard people below me.
[02:26:56.786 --> 02:26:58.987]  Where are the other guests in the hotel?
[02:26:59.227 --> 02:27:01.447]  Why aren't they being spoken to by the media?
[02:27:03.368 --> 02:27:05.269]  I mean... The whole thing reeks.
[02:27:05.729 --> 02:27:06.289]  What do you think?
[02:27:06.369 --> 02:27:06.689]  It does.
[02:27:08.430 --> 02:27:09.570]  I think it's all a cover-up.
[02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:14.612]  It's probably either Antifa, ISIS, CIA.
[02:27:14.692 --> 02:27:15.932]  Maybe all of it together.
[02:27:17.154 --> 02:27:18.995]  And I don't think we'll ever know the truth, man.
[02:27:19.456 --> 02:27:20.917]  I never, I doubt it.
[02:27:21.597 --> 02:27:22.498]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:27:22.578 --> 02:27:30.423]  And what do you make of them having to back off now and have the hotel owner, everybody say, okay, we've changed the timeline and the hotel owner says no one's being told the truth.
[02:27:30.884 --> 02:27:31.824]  I mean, this is huge.
[02:27:31.864 --> 02:27:35.127]  This is like in the Associated Press, but notice it's not getting any coverage now.
[02:27:36.608 --> 02:27:37.048]  Exactly.
[02:27:37.128 --> 02:27:42.912]  I mean, everyday news that you watch when you wake up to have your coffee, a neighborhood gets shot up or something.
[02:27:43.072 --> 02:27:43.773]  What do you see?
[02:27:43.933 --> 02:27:45.674]  You see eyewitnesses, you see people that
[02:27:46.331 --> 02:27:48.993]  Hear everything going on, and they're the ones being interviewed.
[02:27:49.474 --> 02:27:50.154]  You don't see that.
[02:27:51.695 --> 02:27:53.277]  They're shutting it up completely, man.
[02:27:53.337 --> 02:27:53.697]  They are.
[02:27:55.098 --> 02:28:00.302]  Well, that's, you know, before the 90s, when there was a terror attack, they'd cover it up so it wouldn't give the terrorists what they wanted.
[02:28:00.983 --> 02:28:02.824]  And I just think... My big brother can't do that now.
[02:28:03.645 --> 02:28:04.105]  Exactly.
[02:28:05.006 --> 02:28:08.929]  You and I have the capable means to show the world what the truth is.
[02:28:09.830 --> 02:28:13.033]  So what are they going to do now, Dave, as this all comes out?
[02:28:14.721 --> 02:28:16.502]  They're going to divert attention to something else.
[02:28:16.742 --> 02:28:17.502]  They always will.
[02:28:18.623 --> 02:28:19.483]  Like Weinstein!
[02:28:19.683 --> 02:28:21.184]  Like, like, like Weinstein!
[02:28:21.944 --> 02:28:22.464]  Exactly.
[02:28:22.565 --> 02:28:24.786]  And Trump's calm before the storm.
[02:28:26.786 --> 02:28:28.347]  You know, it's all cover up.
[02:28:28.467 --> 02:28:36.631]  And on the idea of him being radical, I can tell you first hand, you need to look at the prisons in the United States.
[02:28:37.436 --> 02:28:38.918]  I was in it for two and a half years.
[02:28:39.638 --> 02:28:41.640]  I watched people get converted over to Islam.
[02:28:42.641 --> 02:28:47.285]  They push it on them, because they know they're going to get out and do the same damn thing over again.
[02:28:48.866 --> 02:28:49.427]  Absolutely.
[02:28:49.467 --> 02:28:52.930]  Yeah, that's what the prisons are, is giant Islamic recruitment centers.
[02:28:53.470 --> 02:28:54.291]  Thank you so much, Dave.
[02:28:54.311 --> 02:28:54.811]  Great points.
[02:28:54.911 --> 02:28:57.393]  Andy, Kelly, Jesse, I'm going to write to you on the other side.
[02:28:57.434 --> 02:28:57.994]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:58.054 --> 02:29:01.397]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:03.018 --> 02:29:04.560]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[02:29:05.822 --> 02:29:11.146]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[02:29:11.406 --> 02:29:12.527]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[02:29:12.787 --> 02:29:15.089]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[02:29:15.770 --> 02:29:22.274]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[02:29:22.475 --> 02:29:25.817]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[02:29:26.137 --> 02:29:27.939]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[02:29:28.579 --> 02:29:36.989]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[02:29:37.029 --> 02:29:37.970]  They know how great it is.
[02:29:38.911 --> 02:29:42.655]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[02:29:43.596 --> 02:29:44.997]  Tropic means for the brain.
[02:29:45.798 --> 02:29:53.663]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[02:29:54.103 --> 02:29:59.887]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[02:30:05.131 --> 02:30:05.552]  That comes to $50.03.
[02:30:05.672 --> 02:30:09.716]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[02:30:10.137 --> 02:30:13.280]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[02:30:13.320 --> 02:30:14.282]  It's a good deal at $39.
[02:30:15.463 --> 02:30:16.184]  It's $19.96 at Infowarslife.com.

[02:31:27.389 --> 02:31:36.278]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[02:31:36.798 --> 02:31:37.439]  Concentrate.
[02:31:37.459 --> 02:31:39.241]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[02:31:39.501 --> 02:31:40.863]  Next level compared to whey.
[02:31:40.883 --> 02:31:42.785]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[02:31:43.206 --> 02:31:44.067]  It's incredible.
[02:31:44.548 --> 02:31:46.450]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[02:31:46.650 --> 02:31:47.791]  It's bigger than I am already.
[02:31:48.252 --> 02:31:49.153]  At 15, incredible.
[02:31:49.474 --> 02:31:50.355]  It is amazing.
[02:31:50.715 --> 02:31:51.997]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:52.758 --> 02:31:53.558]  50% off Caveman.

[02:31:56.682 --> 02:31:59.024]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[02:31:59.464 --> 02:32:04.627]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[02:32:05.047 --> 02:32:06.448]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[02:32:06.688 --> 02:32:07.829]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[02:32:07.849 --> 02:32:09.050]  I want to thank you.
[02:32:09.370 --> 02:32:10.430]  We're all in this together.
[02:32:10.951 --> 02:32:20.857]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[02:33:06.614 --> 02:33:09.236]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.229 --> 02:33:22.173]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.415 --> 02:33:28.156]  Look at the latest Ben Garrison graphic.
[02:33:28.436 --> 02:33:31.418]  It's on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[02:33:32.279 --> 02:33:34.620]  It's a cartoon Bill Cosby and a cartoon Bill Clinton.
[02:33:34.740 --> 02:33:38.822]  Man, he captures how evil-looking Bill Clinton is.
[02:33:39.203 --> 02:33:39.763]  Incredible.
[02:33:40.603 --> 02:33:43.045]  I don't see what all the fuss is about.
[02:33:43.545 --> 02:33:44.566]  You did nothing wrong.
[02:33:45.774 --> 02:33:51.578]  And then there's Weinstein right there, dead center, in the middle of the shot.
[02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:58.864]  Look, his only crime so far in Hollywood is that he wasn't raping small children.
[02:33:59.925 --> 02:34:03.628]  But don't think for a moment that that isn't going to come out.
[02:34:04.388 --> 02:34:14.056]  Because in the sociopath, psychopath, elite maggot class, you don't even get entrance or entree into what they're doing unless you
[02:34:15.486 --> 02:34:16.526]  I don't want to prey on the innocents.
[02:34:17.547 --> 02:34:19.948]  And there is a global revolution against that.
[02:34:20.568 --> 02:34:22.509]  The tide of people waking up is coming in.
[02:34:25.130 --> 02:34:32.693]  Because there's a lot of lazy people in the world, but there's also a lot of sociopaths and psychopaths that like to feed on people or just don't care.
[02:34:33.253 --> 02:34:40.536]  And then there's folks who do care that get manipulated by the psychopaths and sociopaths using news to make us guilty and do what they say.
[02:34:42.691 --> 02:34:55.159]  But as people that do have conscience wake up, as that unfolds, the enemy begins to go into full panic.
[02:34:55.259 --> 02:34:55.839]  What was that?
[02:34:56.179 --> 02:34:58.100]  You guys put amazing stuff on screen all the time.
[02:34:58.581 --> 02:35:03.464]  They put a news article up about the pedophile that Hollywood embraces a director.
[02:35:03.804 --> 02:35:04.404]  I didn't know that.
[02:35:04.684 --> 02:35:05.585]  Put that back up for me, please.
[02:35:07.946 --> 02:35:09.547]  Looks like John Wayne Gacy, but it's not.
[02:35:09.908 --> 02:35:12.089]  The pedophile director embraced by Hollywood
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:20.761]  That's the Daily Beast, and let's read about it.
[02:35:21.142 --> 02:35:29.787]  Filmmaker Victor Salva was convicted of raping a 12-year-old boy, but his new film, Jeepers Creepers 3, is now playing in theaters.
[02:35:30.247 --> 02:35:31.989]  Why is Hollywood giving the monster a pass?
[02:35:32.029 --> 02:35:34.630]  Well, what is the Daily Beast gives Hillary Clinton a pass?
[02:35:35.411 --> 02:35:37.752]  But see, now they're starting to report on it.
[02:35:38.673 --> 02:35:39.813]  Yeah, that's just this month.
[02:35:40.334 --> 02:35:43.196]  Just a few days ago, because they understand the tide's turned.
[02:35:44.597 --> 02:35:47.799]  Salon's even pulled down all their pro-pedophile articles.
[02:35:48.752 --> 02:35:49.552]  Yeah, that was this month.
[02:35:51.093 --> 02:35:58.296]  They had articles up there with men, with videos of five-year-old girls dancing in front of them, talking about it's okay if they want to have sex with them.
[02:35:58.616 --> 02:36:01.537]  I mean, imagine the warped evil.
[02:36:02.077 --> 02:36:04.238]  But again, they went too far, see?
[02:36:04.298 --> 02:36:05.378]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[02:36:05.398 --> 02:36:10.260]  Let me see, Andy's been holding the longest, and Kelly, Shawn, Jesse, and others.
[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:13.101]  Andy in Indiana, you're on the air, thank you for holding, go ahead.
[02:36:14.221 --> 02:36:15.702]  Thanks for taking my phone call, Alex.
[02:36:18.186 --> 02:36:25.171]  I just wanted to let you know you are such a breath of fresh air when it comes to any type of media people could listen to today.
[02:36:26.772 --> 02:36:27.552]  Well, I'm just like you.
[02:36:27.612 --> 02:36:29.073]  I'm a regular guy that has a show, bro.
[02:36:29.374 --> 02:36:32.896]  We're just here looking at a pile of pedophile scum in Hollywood and saying we're done.
[02:36:33.236 --> 02:36:39.360]  Bunch of steroid heads, spoiled brats, SJWs funded by Hollywood and the NFL saying they hate everybody.
[02:36:39.380 --> 02:36:40.581]  So, we hate them too.
[02:36:40.601 --> 02:36:47.265]  I mean, it's all just basically that we started pulling away from them so they're freaking out trying to bully us back into submission.
[02:36:47.486 --> 02:36:47.766]  Go ahead.
[02:36:48.783 --> 02:36:49.923]  Can't agree with you more.
[02:36:50.243 --> 02:37:18.151]  I just wanted to tell you, I started listening back in February when you were on the Joe Rogan podcast, and I've been a listener ever since, and I think that's important because the first time I heard you, you were uncensored, unfiltered, and I really got to know that you have sources, you say it as it is, and to be honest, being able to get out on more platforms like that I think is only going to help grow the InfoWar, because I'm an average American, right?
[02:37:18.743 --> 02:37:20.604]  I'm a mid-20s smart guy.
[02:37:20.624 --> 02:37:23.085]  When I hear you, I'm really connected with you.
[02:37:23.765 --> 02:37:25.446]  I want to talk about something else.
[02:37:25.706 --> 02:37:34.409]  I don't know if you guys saw in the Drudge Report, but there is a pharmacist that delivers drugs directly to congressmen and women.
[02:37:37.683 --> 02:37:38.443]  ...about Alzheimer's.
[02:37:38.463 --> 02:37:39.464]  Have you seen that on Drudge yet?
[02:37:40.244 --> 02:37:40.925]  Yes, I have.
[02:37:41.025 --> 02:37:41.945]  It's very powerful.
[02:37:42.685 --> 02:37:44.766]  We have our own story about it as well.
[02:37:45.487 --> 02:37:48.548]  But here's a story out of Stat News from Drudge Report.
[02:37:49.869 --> 02:37:54.631]  An old-school pharmacy hand-delivers drugs to Congress, a little-known perk for the powerful.
[02:37:55.491 --> 02:37:58.293]  And it goes on that a lot of them have Alzheimer's, yeah.
[02:37:59.753 --> 02:38:01.274]  Hey, that's a dangerous disease.
[02:38:01.354 --> 02:38:02.755]  My grandmother died from that.
[02:38:02.895 --> 02:38:05.036]  And I'm going to tell you, anyone
[02:38:05.569 --> 02:38:09.490]  In Congress right now, suffering from that disease, I think the American people should know about that.
[02:38:11.771 --> 02:38:12.351]  No, I agree.
[02:38:12.391 --> 02:38:13.851]  What do you make of this big story?
[02:38:15.532 --> 02:38:31.856]  Well, you know, I think that, and I don't know the pharmacist and what compliance he has to have from client-patient privileges, but I would assume that our government would be able to bring him behind closed doors and talk to him and say, we need a list of people that could possibly
[02:38:33.456 --> 02:38:38.979]  Well look, sir, they all exempted themselves from Obamacare.
[02:38:39.559 --> 02:38:41.400]  They exempt themselves from some taxes.
[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:47.464]  The EU bureaucracy that's unelected, but just put in power and rules, it's tax exempt!
[02:38:48.883 --> 02:38:53.528]  They don't pay the same taxes that people living in EU countries do.
[02:38:53.628 --> 02:38:55.570]  I mean, that's what I mean about all this.
[02:38:55.630 --> 02:39:00.775]  They just hope it all stays in the bureaucracy and stays complex and we don't look at it.
[02:39:01.295 --> 02:39:02.096]  But great point.
[02:39:02.116 --> 02:39:04.438]  Glad you brought that up because they brought me this story about an hour ago.
[02:39:04.458 --> 02:39:06.600]  Here's another one.
[02:39:06.620 --> 02:39:07.241]  World War III.
[02:39:07.321 --> 02:39:10.845]  North Korea claims Trump has lit the wick of war.
[02:39:10.925 --> 02:39:12.066]  Threatens hail of fire.
[02:39:14.568 --> 02:39:17.550]  Yeah, they keep saying they're going to preemptively attack us and we're just supposed to put up with it.
[02:39:17.831 --> 02:39:28.439]  Again, I don't want war, but I mean, it's a repulsive, evil, disgusting, communist dictatorship with a third generation royal running it.
[02:39:28.459 --> 02:39:29.620]  I mean, I'm going to throw up.
[02:39:31.262 --> 02:39:33.864]  It's like if Harvey Weinstein had a country.
[02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:46.862]  Yeah, his dad used to have Japanese women kidnapped that he wanted and smuggled back so he could have sex with them, rape them, in a seven-story rape compound he had there in the North Korean capital.
[02:39:46.902 --> 02:39:48.362]  I mean, who could make that up?
[02:39:51.003 --> 02:39:52.643]  Who could make any of this stuff up?
[02:39:52.723 --> 02:39:53.524]  It's like, what?
[02:39:54.144 --> 02:39:54.384]  What?
[02:39:55.164 --> 02:39:58.265]  But we just put these people in power and just have them run everything.
[02:39:59.345 --> 02:39:59.945]  Thank you, Andy.
[02:40:01.825 --> 02:40:03.646]  You know, Joe Rogan is a great guy.
[02:40:03.886 --> 02:40:04.406]  I like Joe.
[02:40:04.426 --> 02:40:05.026]  He's really smart.
[02:40:06.164 --> 02:40:10.906]  He's been successful out on television and on UFC that's revolutionary in a lot of ways.
[02:40:11.026 --> 02:40:12.226]  And then he's been in some big movies.
[02:40:12.926 --> 02:40:14.647]  And he really is critical of Hollywood a lot.
[02:40:14.687 --> 02:40:18.108]  He had a lot of courage exposing pedophilia and stuff when I was on his show.
[02:40:18.688 --> 02:40:20.909]  And he said, hey, I want you to come back home before my new studio opens.
[02:40:20.949 --> 02:40:21.969]  But the new studio hasn't opened.
[02:40:22.810 --> 02:40:23.590]  But he wanted me on.
[02:40:25.057 --> 02:40:27.939]  Like September 1st, and then he just said, well, I'm a little busy, maybe later.
[02:40:27.959 --> 02:40:31.021]  I mean, I don't need to go out on Joe's show to be successful.
[02:40:31.841 --> 02:40:35.603]  He just got a lot of heat, and they did censor some of his shows over it, I think, threatening him.
[02:40:36.264 --> 02:40:41.187]  I'm not saying he's scared to have me on, but I'm not the person to ask to go back on Joe's show.
[02:40:41.627 --> 02:40:43.568]  I'll go on there anytime, anywhere I'm ready.
[02:40:44.068 --> 02:40:47.250]  And it was his number one show in history, about double any other one.
[02:40:47.470 --> 02:40:48.571]  The number one podcast ever.
[02:40:49.363 --> 02:40:51.004]  So, of course, I shouldn't come back on.
[02:40:51.044 --> 02:40:53.465]  I mean, if something's number one, you don't ever want to have it again.
[02:40:53.485 --> 02:40:54.846]  So, I understand.
[02:40:56.526 --> 02:41:00.408]  But the show definitely works together, and I'd love to have Joe on here anytime he wants to come on.
[02:41:00.909 --> 02:41:01.709]  He's a busy guy, though.
[02:41:01.729 --> 02:41:02.990]  He does comedy a couple nights a week.
[02:41:03.350 --> 02:41:08.772]  There's a lot of other stuff, but... There you go.
[02:41:09.373 --> 02:41:11.474]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:41:12.774 --> 02:41:15.596]  Let's talk to Kelly in Wisconsin, then Sean.
[02:41:15.636 --> 02:41:16.256]  Kelly, you're on the air.
[02:41:17.785 --> 02:41:18.225]  Hi, Alex.
[02:41:18.265 --> 02:41:18.926]  How are you today?
[02:41:18.986 --> 02:41:19.466]  I'm okay.
[02:41:19.486 --> 02:41:20.647]  Thank you.
[02:41:20.667 --> 02:41:21.008]  Okay.
[02:41:21.408 --> 02:41:26.272]  I love the fact that scripture says, no weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[02:41:26.772 --> 02:41:31.276]  And I love how we get to use Facebook, Google, and YouTube and turn it around on them.
[02:41:31.656 --> 02:41:32.177]  Exactly.
[02:41:32.197 --> 02:41:36.380]  I want to touch base on a couple of things.
[02:41:36.981 --> 02:41:43.606]  One, I do forensic auditing and you really struck me when you were hitting yourself on the head going, wake up, wake up.
[02:41:44.107 --> 02:41:45.268]  Well that happened to me.
[02:41:45.808 --> 02:41:46.008]  Really?
[02:41:46.028 --> 02:41:46.809]  A few months ago.
[02:41:46.889 --> 02:41:50.251]  And I'm going, this just does not make sense.
[02:41:50.831 --> 02:41:56.734]  So what I did was I went back to the point of Hillary losing the election.
[02:41:57.735 --> 02:42:02.998]  What did Obama, what transpired from the day after Hillary lost the election?
[02:42:03.458 --> 02:42:05.539]  Because they've been in power for decades.
[02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:10.062]  They dug in, they refused to leave, they just went crazy.
[02:42:10.822 --> 02:42:11.703]  Crap moments.
[02:42:12.591 --> 02:42:24.575]  They got 72 days to clean up 20 years plus of trail, and how are they going to make their plan come to fruition?
[02:42:24.615 --> 02:42:26.916]  They're going to turn it around and make it an investigation about Trump.
[02:42:28.436 --> 02:42:29.937]  Well, that was a distraction.
[02:42:29.997 --> 02:42:30.837]  We all know that.
[02:42:30.957 --> 02:42:34.338]  But you're absolutely, your callers have been nailing it since I've been here.
[02:42:34.358 --> 02:42:34.838]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:42:34.878 --> 02:42:35.478]  I went to you late.
[02:42:35.519 --> 02:42:36.799]  I want to hear this, Kelly.
[02:42:38.615 --> 02:42:41.837]  Yeah, because I said earlier, we're like, been asleep, a sleeping giant.
[02:42:42.858 --> 02:42:46.780]  And they thought as they were hitting us on the head and whipping us that it was keeping us in line, we were asleep.
[02:42:47.281 --> 02:42:49.082]  But the hitting us in the head finally woke us up.
[02:42:49.122 --> 02:42:50.223]  We're like, what are you doing?
[02:42:51.023 --> 02:42:53.005]  So, yeah, that's how that works.
[02:42:53.045 --> 02:42:54.065]  Go back with Kelly, then Sean.
[02:42:54.085 --> 02:42:55.646]  I'm gonna get to everybody here today.
[02:42:55.666 --> 02:42:57.087]  And then who we got hosting that fourth hour?
[02:42:57.588 --> 02:42:58.508]  I bet it's gonna be good.
[02:42:58.568 --> 02:42:59.009]  Stay with us.
[02:43:02.291 --> 02:43:03.832]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[02:43:05.106 --> 02:43:10.430]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[02:43:10.690 --> 02:43:11.811]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[02:43:12.071 --> 02:43:14.373]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[02:43:15.033 --> 02:43:21.558]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[02:43:21.758 --> 02:43:25.100]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[02:43:25.420 --> 02:43:27.222]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[02:43:27.862 --> 02:43:36.272]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[02:43:36.292 --> 02:43:37.253]  They know how great it is.
[02:43:38.174 --> 02:43:41.918]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[02:43:42.759 --> 02:43:43.319]  We're good to go.
[02:44:05.797 --> 02:44:06.458]  Zero three.

[02:47:25.085 --> 02:47:29.826]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:29.866 --> 02:47:33.567]  Alright, I'm going right back to your phone calls and more news here.
[02:47:33.607 --> 02:47:36.667]  Roger Stone's got his plate loaded hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:47:36.687 --> 02:47:39.688]  That's coming up here in just about 10 minutes, 13 minutes on the clock.
[02:47:40.848 --> 02:47:43.209]  Just briefly, it has changed the world.
[02:47:44.369 --> 02:47:51.278]  That individuals are funding libertarian, Americana, common sense, conservative, Christian media.
[02:47:52.751 --> 02:47:55.012]  Most of the big top grossing films now are Christian.
[02:47:55.932 --> 02:47:57.693]  And they're outside the Hollywood system.
[02:47:58.373 --> 02:48:01.895]  Even though they're not perfect films, nobody's perfect, it's breaking their back.
[02:48:02.515 --> 02:48:05.096]  So it's not like they're imploding and everybody else is imploding.
[02:48:05.476 --> 02:48:17.081]  Whole new systems are rising as the NFL scum, as the Hollywood trash, as the globalist controllers that use these spectacles that we thought were Americana to control us.
[02:48:17.682 --> 02:48:20.763]  They've now shown themselves they are naked enemies.
[02:48:21.989 --> 02:48:27.171]  And the Libertarian Revolution, the Patriot Revolution, the Trump Revolution helped manifest all that.
[02:48:28.011 --> 02:48:32.413]  So we can have a clear confrontation with these people.
[02:48:33.433 --> 02:48:37.635]  But as mad as they are, folks, they're planning mass murder.
[02:48:37.655 --> 02:48:38.915]  They're planning helter-skelter.
[02:48:39.796 --> 02:48:45.618]  They're planning Charlie Manson, 1969, virtual army of unidentified assassins.
[02:48:47.031 --> 02:48:48.372]  Mass shootings, death, murder.
[02:48:48.412 --> 02:48:50.934]  They thought October 1st would signal that.
[02:48:51.434 --> 02:48:51.914]  It hasn't.
[02:48:52.835 --> 02:48:54.476]  The whole official story has collapsed there.
[02:48:55.417 --> 02:49:00.601]  So now more importantly, now more important than ever, please pray for him full force, number one.
[02:49:01.401 --> 02:49:03.242]  Number two, spread the articles, the videos, the links.
[02:49:03.783 --> 02:49:05.244]  We're not perfect, but we're trying hard.
[02:49:05.604 --> 02:49:06.765]  The information the enemy hates.
[02:49:08.906 --> 02:49:10.587]  And nothing can stop you word of mouth.
[02:49:10.747 --> 02:49:11.288]  Spread the word.
[02:49:11.768 --> 02:49:12.448]  Just keep doing it.
[02:49:12.548 --> 02:49:13.329]  It's having a huge effect.
[02:49:13.869 --> 02:49:17.071]  And also, getting a CNN is fake news shirt.
[02:49:17.451 --> 02:49:19.793]  I know you know that, but you'll meet like-minded people.
[02:49:19.813 --> 02:49:20.593]  You'll spread the word.
[02:49:20.653 --> 02:49:24.596]  You'll get out in the field, outside of cyberspace, and actually start networking.
[02:49:24.636 --> 02:49:25.836]  Get it at InfoWars.com.
[02:49:26.757 --> 02:49:29.759]  Baseball cap, got some new great ones made by Richardson.

[02:50:07.003 --> 02:50:08.664]  Hi, I wanted to point out.
[02:50:34.105 --> 02:50:41.411]  Isn't it amazing how there's so much civil unrest and white fascism when Barack Obama is half white?
[02:50:41.951 --> 02:50:45.033]  He never embraced the fact that he's half white.
[02:50:45.674 --> 02:50:47.275]  And he basically stole the title.
[02:50:47.575 --> 02:50:49.396]  Which just means he's half human anyways.
[02:50:50.416 --> 02:50:50.516]  Right.
[02:50:50.596 --> 02:50:52.056]  Always you're half black, half white.
[02:50:52.076 --> 02:50:57.518]  It's like, you don't look at some beautiful woman that's a mulatto or whatever and say, she's half black, half white.
[02:50:57.558 --> 02:50:58.478]  That's a beautiful woman.
[02:50:59.178 --> 02:51:00.778]  I don't look at some woman who's exotic.
[02:51:00.818 --> 02:51:04.179]  You can't tell if she's Asian or Brazilian.
[02:51:04.219 --> 02:51:05.199]  You just know they're gorgeous.
[02:51:05.299 --> 02:51:07.800]  I just, I get, they got red blood, my dear.
[02:51:08.420 --> 02:51:08.820]  But go ahead.
[02:51:09.360 --> 02:51:12.661]  About a unifying effect that could have had on America.
[02:51:12.821 --> 02:51:13.901]  What a vehicle
[02:51:15.492 --> 02:51:16.693]  To unite America.
[02:51:17.033 --> 02:51:17.794]  Oh absolutely!
[02:51:18.114 --> 02:51:19.916]  Listen, I didn't even like McCain, he was so bad.
[02:51:20.176 --> 02:51:20.957]  So I was neutral.
[02:51:20.997 --> 02:51:25.901]  I didn't like Obama, but I thought maybe the left at some level really does want to have unity.
[02:51:26.001 --> 02:51:26.281]  No.
[02:51:26.621 --> 02:51:30.865]  They use it as a weapon to make things worse, and you're absolutely right.
[02:51:32.426 --> 02:51:40.573]  Well, and Hollywood played an integral part in it because all of a sudden you came out with the color purple, Django Unchained, they remade Ruth.
[02:51:40.593 --> 02:51:42.374]  They made hundreds of movies!
[02:51:43.305 --> 02:51:45.387]  They were totally historically inaccurate.
[02:51:45.488 --> 02:51:45.928]  Exactly.
[02:51:45.988 --> 02:51:47.810]  Pouring salt in the wound, Kelly.
[02:51:48.931 --> 02:51:49.632]  Absolutely.
[02:51:49.772 --> 02:51:51.695]  And then, they're using the music.
[02:51:51.855 --> 02:51:53.517]  The hip-hop, rap, the heavy metal.
[02:51:55.574 --> 02:51:57.875]  And they do exactly what the corporate owners say.
[02:51:58.535 --> 02:51:59.395]  Talk about slavery.
[02:52:00.695 --> 02:52:03.856]  Everybody's enslaved by this Hollywood, and we're coming off the plantation.
[02:52:04.256 --> 02:52:05.496]  Just like Moses out of Egypt.
[02:52:05.536 --> 02:52:06.257]  God bless you, Kelly.
[02:52:06.717 --> 02:52:07.817]  Let's move to some other folks here.
[02:52:07.837 --> 02:52:08.317]  Great points.
[02:52:09.017 --> 02:52:10.477]  Hey, some folks are holding a long time.
[02:52:10.517 --> 02:52:12.278]  We can take 50 calls at a time.
[02:52:12.618 --> 02:52:14.518]  The good news is I'm taking a lot of calls today.
[02:52:14.698 --> 02:52:15.378]  Been wanting to do that.
[02:52:15.819 --> 02:52:17.419]  I'm getting better and better here, so I'm proud of that.
[02:52:17.899 --> 02:52:19.519]  Sean in... I'll give myself a gold star.
[02:52:19.979 --> 02:52:21.260]  Sean in Pennsylvania.
[02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:21.780]  You're on the air.
[02:52:21.820 --> 02:52:22.300]  Thanks for holding.
[02:52:25.305 --> 02:52:29.786]  Hey Alex, thanks a lot for all your products and for everything.
[02:52:29.806 --> 02:52:30.486]  Thank you.
[02:52:30.526 --> 02:52:42.750]  I recently stumbled onto something which I'm very ignorant on and I'd like to take on it because I respect your historical knowledge and it may touch on everything from pedophilia, devil worship, money manipulation, and mostly to US-Russia relations.
[02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:44.331]  It's basically psychopath rule.
[02:52:44.831 --> 02:52:46.432]  So there's a lot of stuff psychopaths are into.
[02:52:46.712 --> 02:52:48.814]  Devil worship, pedophilia, raping women.
[02:52:49.114 --> 02:52:51.235]  It's just, it's bad guys.
[02:52:51.535 --> 02:52:56.419]  The real 1% are 1 tenth of 1% that are genetic psychopaths.
[02:52:56.499 --> 02:52:56.779]  Go ahead.
[02:52:57.998 --> 02:53:04.160]  Can you give me some historical background or your opinion on the existence of the Khazarian Mafia, their influence in our world today?
[02:53:04.280 --> 02:53:08.341]  And finally, are they the globalist group which did not want U.S.
[02:53:08.561 --> 02:53:12.642]  and Russia to unite because through history, Russia has been the driving force against them?
[02:53:14.383 --> 02:53:20.665]  You know, there's big historical and genetic testing debate about, what was it, Kessler that wrote The Thirteenth Tribe?
[02:53:20.685 --> 02:53:21.765]  Is that the name of the book?
[02:53:24.926 --> 02:53:39.302]  I read that book like 20 years ago and then I looked into a mainline study and they've done genetic testing of Ashkenazi Jews in Russia versus Sephardic Jews and they still found that they have genetic backgrounds shared.
[02:53:39.923 --> 02:53:41.845]  But yeah, the Sephardic or the more Middle Eastern
[02:53:42.966 --> 02:53:43.566]  I think so.
[02:54:01.371 --> 02:54:02.592]  And it just gets really complex.
[02:54:02.632 --> 02:54:07.276]  You have what's Georgia today was the Khazarian Empire that converted to Judaism.
[02:54:07.296 --> 02:54:08.097]  That did happen.
[02:54:09.218 --> 02:54:13.762]  And then it was more kind of almost like a gypsy group almost that said they were Jewish.
[02:54:14.242 --> 02:54:16.124]  So there's some truth to that group.
[02:54:16.584 --> 02:54:24.631]  But then to say that they don't have any connection to the other group when some of the Jews came into the area and actually had intermarrying, it's a complex issue.
[02:54:25.752 --> 02:54:38.838]  It is true that the Bolshevik Revolution, Alexander Shultz and Eaton wrote about this, was financed by a lot of big New York banks, but also the British Empire had been wanting to get rid of their Russian cousins that were actually German.
[02:54:39.098 --> 02:54:46.682]  So the King of England and then his Russian cousin were almost identical in the way they looked.
[02:54:46.702 --> 02:54:50.144]  They were both from the same German Saxe-Coburg-Gotha line.
[02:54:50.424 --> 02:54:52.165]  So it's a huge historical subject.
[02:54:53.089 --> 02:55:00.794]  They've been allied with England in World War I, but then they double-crossed them after World War I, and actually wanted to get rid, because England had a lot of wars with Russia.
[02:55:00.814 --> 02:55:03.615]  So it was kind of that cousins feuding.
[02:55:04.176 --> 02:55:10.299]  But it is true that there'd been a lot of Jews that had come to New York, who had thought they'd been persecuted by the Tsars.
[02:55:10.739 --> 02:55:21.426]  When they got hired, about 100,000 mainly Jewish folks were put on ships, shipped over, and then hundreds of millions in gold, which is all mainline history, in to invade Russia.
[02:55:22.910 --> 02:55:24.011]  What I was reading was that the
[02:55:47.652 --> 02:55:55.276]  Uh, the Jewish religion was overtaken by a bunch of devil-worshipping clans from, um, Qazari.
[02:55:55.336 --> 02:55:56.216]  No, no, no.
[02:55:57.317 --> 02:55:58.617]  People always conflate things.
[02:55:58.677 --> 02:55:59.798]  It's just not that simple.
[02:56:00.218 --> 02:56:03.339]  You have the Babylonian captivity that happened twice.
[02:56:04.420 --> 02:56:15.325]  You had other captivities where the Jews were like super right-wing, straight up, and then they got captured by the Babylonians and then wrote a bunch of new, not the Torah, that's the Bible, the Old Testament,
[02:56:16.226 --> 02:56:23.733]  And we have the Christian Second Testament to that, so the merger of Judaism and Christianity there in Christ's New Deal.
[02:56:24.434 --> 02:56:35.505]  But if you look at what happened with the Babylonian captivities and others, then that's when they came out with these new books and a lot of things, and that's where the occult came from, not from the Georgians.
[02:56:37.059 --> 02:56:43.308]  Do you think that some of this occult stuff that remains is what's taking over some of our government?
[02:56:43.348 --> 02:56:46.052]  Well, yeah, but I don't want to say it's a Jewish satanic conspiracy.
[02:56:46.353 --> 02:56:48.156]  Before Christianity, everything was occult.
[02:56:48.616 --> 02:56:51.280]  They were doing human sacrifices, bro, in, you know, the year 2000.
[02:56:54.223 --> 02:56:56.504]  Nobody's seen a Jew in England or whatever.
[02:56:56.564 --> 02:57:08.488]  So, every culture from the Aztecs to the Celts, to the British, to the Visigoths, to the Astragoths, to every tribe was human sacrificing.
[02:57:09.148 --> 02:57:10.850]  And it depended in time.
[02:57:11.090 --> 02:57:17.756]  Whether you were in the Pacific Ocean, or whether you were in ancient China or Africa, people were shrinking heads, drinking blood, cutting hearts out.
[02:57:18.256 --> 02:57:20.538]  There's always been psychopath groups that get in charge and do that.
[02:57:20.818 --> 02:57:23.681]  But absolutely, the media will cut this out of context, I don't care.
[02:57:24.241 --> 02:57:31.568]  Absolutely, after the Babylonian captivities and other things, Judaism then, in some of its sects, adopted
[02:57:32.898 --> 02:57:34.860]  You know, what you'd call classical black arts.
[02:57:35.201 --> 02:57:42.810]  But then you can argue Masonic stuff is that, going back to Solomon's Temple and all the wives he took on, and you can say that Judaism was corrupted at that point.
[02:57:43.511 --> 02:57:48.176]  But, I mean, every culture has been, quote, corrupted by the occult because that's all that existed pre-Christ.
[02:57:48.437 --> 02:57:48.857]  We'll be back.
[02:57:49.178 --> 02:57:49.999]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.

[02:58:22.548 --> 02:58:31.149]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:58:31.289 --> 02:58:39.391]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[02:59:54.885 --> 03:00:00.806]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.927 --> 03:00:12.831]  It all ends, and it all starts with Abraham and Jacob, and then the three great peoples of the world.
[03:00:13.912 --> 03:00:16.434]  It all goes back to human sacrifice.
[03:00:18.816 --> 03:00:21.078]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:21.498 --> 03:00:26.722]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:29.244 --> 03:00:36.230]  A caller earlier asked me, is the Satanism we see in America a product of Judaism?
[03:00:38.326 --> 03:00:40.907]  And the answer is yes and no.
[03:00:42.327 --> 03:00:43.267]  What is Satanism?
[03:00:43.787 --> 03:00:47.968]  It's the love of the psychopathic rule of the sociopath's kingdom.
[03:00:49.829 --> 03:00:52.429]  So you got psychopaths on top of sociopaths serving them.
[03:00:54.510 --> 03:01:03.452]  But if you go back to Abraham and Jacob, when he's gonna sacrifice his son and then God stays his hand, and probably put an engraving of that image up,
[03:01:05.831 --> 03:01:15.474]  That's what every culture from China to Mesoamerica at that time, 3,000 plus years ago, everyone was killing their children.
[03:01:16.674 --> 03:01:21.636]  Everyone was slitting their throats, generally of the king or the nobleman's firstborn son.
[03:01:22.116 --> 03:01:27.157]  Oh, the royalty had to kill their children in Mesoamerica and in what's the Middle East today.
[03:01:28.178 --> 03:01:35.260]  And it was the Jews in the first to write it, some cultures didn't do it as well, to say, we're going to stop killing people.
[03:01:36.988 --> 03:01:40.570]  We'll kill some doves or some rams and eat them, or maybe a cow.
[03:01:42.931 --> 03:01:45.232]  So then you ask me, are the Jews the devil worshippers?
[03:01:45.592 --> 03:01:49.575]  They're the first group to, at least to write it down to say, let's stop doing this.
[03:01:50.155 --> 03:01:51.235]  It was going on all around them.
[03:01:51.576 --> 03:01:52.476]  Then they wage war.
[03:01:52.496 --> 03:01:54.337]  People say, oh God, the Jews were exterminating everybody.
[03:01:54.617 --> 03:01:57.078]  Yeah, if you did human sacrifice, they would kill everybody.
[03:01:57.539 --> 03:02:00.200]  The Bible, Old Testament says, kill everybody that kills kids.
[03:02:01.060 --> 03:02:03.702]  They put their kids in the fires of Moloch, kill them all.
[03:02:05.424 --> 03:02:09.625]  So this isn't a defense of Judaism or an attack on it.
[03:02:09.745 --> 03:02:11.005]  It's a defense of history.
[03:02:13.466 --> 03:02:19.067]  And so I know it's a big white supremacist thing that Jews invented devil worship and that Jews do Black Sabbaths.
[03:02:20.147 --> 03:02:22.687]  They've had Jews do Black Sabbaths that have been caught.
[03:02:22.707 --> 03:02:24.008]  They've had Catholics caught.
[03:02:24.028 --> 03:02:25.088]  They've had Protestants caught.
[03:02:26.148 --> 03:02:31.429]  Black Sabbaths are a bunch of self-centered bad people wanting to kill men, women, or children and have power.
[03:02:32.278 --> 03:02:34.379]  They don't want to go hunt elk in the mountains.
[03:02:34.419 --> 03:02:35.459]  They don't want to go arm wrestle.
[03:02:35.699 --> 03:02:36.780]  They don't want to have jujitsu.
[03:02:36.820 --> 03:02:38.501]  They don't want to go join the military and fight other men.
[03:02:39.041 --> 03:02:43.643]  They want to be in a cult of creepy guys and have their way with people.
[03:02:46.144 --> 03:02:47.945]  And, you know, that's how I know humans are humans.
[03:02:48.625 --> 03:02:54.568]  Whether it was Africa, or whether it was Asia, or whether it was Latin America, Mesoamerica, or ancient white Europe.
[03:02:56.789 --> 03:02:58.529]  Everybody burned people to death.
[03:02:58.609 --> 03:02:59.650]  Everybody ate hearts.
[03:03:00.703 --> 03:03:08.867]  Everybody did that stuff, and it's all about proving you're the toughest, you're the best, and scaring everybody else in the village through terror that you're the boss.
[03:03:09.747 --> 03:03:14.289]  And finally after terror, people accept it and it becomes their religion.
[03:03:17.190 --> 03:03:24.234]  And so Judaism first rejected what was going on in Babylon and going on in
[03:03:26.653 --> 03:03:30.776]  Persia and going on in Egypt and going on in Greece to a certain extent.
[03:03:30.816 --> 03:03:31.836]  Greece wasn't as corrupt.
[03:03:32.817 --> 03:03:34.698]  Just if they disagreed with you, they'd just throw you off a cliff.
[03:03:34.738 --> 03:03:35.739]  It was really human sacrifice.
[03:03:36.079 --> 03:03:37.200]  And they had some human sacrifice.
[03:03:37.220 --> 03:03:41.182]  It was more like, you know, throw your five-year-old out in the woods for a year and see if they come back.
[03:03:41.242 --> 03:03:42.023]  It was more like that.
[03:03:42.923 --> 03:03:44.064]  That's where eugenics came from.
[03:03:44.084 --> 03:03:45.665]  The elites were like, oh, this is what we're going to do.
[03:03:46.025 --> 03:03:47.846]  We don't just cut people's hearts out for no reason.
[03:03:48.247 --> 03:03:49.387]  We just kill all the weak people.
[03:03:50.288 --> 03:03:51.369]  And, you know, so...
[03:03:52.794 --> 03:03:56.819]  There's just a lot of complex history, and people tend to dumb it all down.
[03:03:56.859 --> 03:03:59.722]  And what I gave you is just a snapshot gestalt.
[03:04:00.783 --> 03:04:04.748]  And it doesn't mean people are like, wow, Mr. Fancy Pants told us all that history.
[03:04:04.808 --> 03:04:05.229]  It's not.
[03:04:05.389 --> 03:04:06.210]  It's interesting.
[03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:09.213]  I mean, how could you quit wanting to know all this?
[03:04:10.410 --> 03:04:12.653]  Roger Stone's coming up, and I know he loves phone calls.
[03:04:12.693 --> 03:04:14.174]  If you want to hold for him, I bet he'll go to you.
[03:04:14.194 --> 03:04:16.757]  Jeff in North Carolina, just ask Stone.
[03:04:16.797 --> 03:04:17.298]  I'm sure he will.
[03:04:17.739 --> 03:04:18.459]  And Jesse and Mike.
[03:04:18.499 --> 03:04:19.681]  I got a bunch of stuff to handle.
[03:04:20.081 --> 03:04:23.926]  I'm busier than a one-legged man in an ass-whooping contest.
[03:04:25.399 --> 03:04:29.963]  So, we're going to be ending my part of the transmission here in about 30 seconds.
[03:04:30.683 --> 03:04:31.564]  Please spread the links.
[03:04:31.644 --> 03:04:33.025]  Please pray for the operation.
[03:04:33.045 --> 03:04:34.026]  There's a reason the enemy hates us.
[03:04:34.446 --> 03:04:35.407]  We're not devil worshippers.
[03:04:35.607 --> 03:04:37.388]  We want you to succeed, and we want to succeed.
[03:04:37.949 --> 03:04:40.711]  And as long as you want to succeed and don't want to get in our way, we'll support you.
[03:04:41.251 --> 03:04:44.254]  If you want to get in our way and try to hurt us, well, we're going to go through you.
[03:04:45.737 --> 03:04:50.660]  Not because we're tough guys or want to be in charge, but because we're not going to let you run our lives.
[03:04:51.400 --> 03:04:52.821]  It's the Great Animating Contest of Liberty.
[03:04:53.361 --> 03:04:53.942]  It's happening now.
[03:04:54.802 --> 03:04:58.284]  And humanity is beginning to rise as the spirit of liberty comes back into the world.
[03:04:58.864 --> 03:04:59.485]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:59.525 --> 03:04:59.825]  Stay with us.
[03:05:04.266 --> 03:05:09.169]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[03:05:09.970 --> 03:05:12.892]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.

[03:05:34.726 --> 03:05:38.149]  That's why I recommend Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.

[03:06:16.243 --> 03:06:23.772]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:25.074 --> 03:06:35.126]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, back live.
[03:06:38.024 --> 03:06:39.345]  Alex Jones here back live.
[03:06:39.365 --> 03:06:46.291]  I was about to punch out and turn the operation over to Roger Stone, who I'm going to be co-hosting with here for a few minutes.
[03:06:47.072 --> 03:06:54.819]  And Nico Acosta, the main producer, came over to me and said, Alex, look at this.
[03:06:54.839 --> 03:06:56.481]  They're not even trying anymore.
[03:06:57.501 --> 03:07:00.004]  Anderson Cooper has come out and attacked yours truly.
[03:07:01.829 --> 03:07:06.332]  And claimed that I fabricated the Soros-Nazi ties.
[03:07:07.153 --> 03:07:14.578]  Now, this is like 11 days ago they announced ISIS claimed responsibility for the Las Vegas attack.
[03:07:15.278 --> 03:07:25.485]  And the next day, Newsweek and Salon and hundreds of fake news publications said that I had just made up ISIS declaring responsibility.
[03:07:25.945 --> 03:07:27.886]  They didn't say, oh, ISIS made it up.
[03:07:28.187 --> 03:07:29.688]  They just said I made it up.
[03:07:30.492 --> 03:07:35.336]  So they're attempting to brand me as the guy that makes things up.
[03:07:35.396 --> 03:07:50.468]  Ladies and gentlemen, Soros on 60 Minutes and on Laird News Hour, and they were able to expose the Laird News Hour footage, admitted that he collaborated with the Nazis and said he wasn't ashamed of it.
[03:07:52.510 --> 03:07:54.592]  George Soros admittedly
[03:07:55.885 --> 03:08:07.595]  With his uncle, helped round up thousands of people, because he was Jewish, and they trusted him, people in the same vein as Anne Frank, and he would round them up, and he said he wasn't ashamed of it, because it was like free markets.
[03:08:07.655 --> 03:08:10.977]  If he wouldn't have helped round them up, someone else wouldn't have done it.
[03:08:11.338 --> 03:08:14.280]  I mean, he admits this in books written about him.
[03:08:15.021 --> 03:08:18.163]  This is next level.
[03:08:20.385 --> 03:08:21.626]  This is next level.
[03:08:22.827 --> 03:08:24.669]  So, here is Anderson Cooper,
[03:08:27.114 --> 03:08:47.443]  Saying I made this up, this is like saying I made up Austin, Texas existing, or George Washington existing, or Pontius Pilate existing, or Obama, or Hillary, I mean, or Donald Trump.
[03:08:47.543 --> 03:08:53.706]  It's so crazy, the articles on Infowars.com, to have them deny
[03:08:55.526 --> 03:08:57.386]  What he says on a video, but here's the difference.
[03:08:58.367 --> 03:09:03.368]  Every time we try to upload this, they go, oh, you copyright violation, CBS 60 Minutes.
[03:09:03.628 --> 03:09:16.050]  We have full, fair use, under all law, open and shut case, no debate, that if we're talking about George Soros and playing a clip of him saying it, under political purposes, it's 100% covered.
[03:09:16.370 --> 03:09:18.771]  Especially when they're saying I'm lying about it.
[03:09:20.171 --> 03:09:26.194]  So everyone take this video, everyone show this to people because this is fake news Waterloo.
[03:09:26.254 --> 03:09:27.254]  They know they're liars.
[03:09:28.455 --> 03:09:29.295]  They know they're caught.
[03:09:30.696 --> 03:09:38.099]  And they've got this cosmetic job going for George Soros who did the Arab Spring that killed over a million people, that helped overthrow Ukraine.
[03:09:38.359 --> 03:09:39.780]  I mean this guy's a monster!
[03:09:41.721 --> 03:09:44.162]  They got arrest warrants out for him in like 10 countries!
[03:09:46.428 --> 03:09:56.717]  They're telling you he never tried to crash the pound, he never overthrew African countries, he never funded radical Islamists, he's not buddies with Weinstein, he's not buddies with the Clintons, he's not coming after your guns.
[03:09:56.837 --> 03:09:57.077]  No!
[03:09:58.358 --> 03:10:04.664]  CNN says it's fake news and now CNN wants to ban any YouTube or Facebook channel that says it.
[03:10:04.764 --> 03:10:05.845]  That's why they're doing it.
[03:10:06.065 --> 03:10:08.968]  Well, the CNN PolitiFact says all
[03:10:10.811 --> 03:10:13.173]  Sixteen intelligence agencies say the Russians did it.
[03:10:13.233 --> 03:10:14.374]  Now they admit none of it.
[03:10:14.394 --> 03:10:15.155]  It was all a lie.
[03:10:15.515 --> 03:10:17.257]  This is just total fraud.
[03:10:17.998 --> 03:10:19.319]  So here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:10:20.199 --> 03:10:24.662]  If it goes that way, the consequences could be literally millions of deaths.
[03:10:25.302 --> 03:10:26.543]  Tony Schwartz, appreciate it.
[03:10:26.583 --> 03:10:27.724]  Meg Haberman as well.
[03:10:27.784 --> 03:10:30.645]  Up next, another white supremacist rally in Charlottesville this past weekend.
[03:10:30.665 --> 03:10:34.108]  And something else caught our attention, one of the more out protesting the white supremacists.
[03:10:34.708 --> 03:10:39.351]  As disgusting as both rallies were, there is something else that caught our eye when it posted this past Friday.
[03:10:39.831 --> 03:10:43.373]  It's the claim that the August protest, the one that killed Ms.
[03:10:43.413 --> 03:10:45.615]  Heyer, was some sort of left-wing plot.
[03:10:45.915 --> 03:10:49.157]  Now, who, you might ask, would say something so offensive and disgusting as that?
[03:10:49.677 --> 03:10:51.700]  Some shock jock radio personality, maybe?
[03:10:52.120 --> 03:10:52.320]  No.
[03:10:52.561 --> 03:10:55.284]  An elected representative who's serving right now in the U.S.
[03:10:55.324 --> 03:10:55.725]  Congress.
[03:10:56.125 --> 03:10:59.169]  Here he is, two-term Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar.
[03:10:59.569 --> 03:11:03.895]  Now, here's exactly what the Congressman said to Vice News Correspondent Ellie Reeve.
[03:11:05.672 --> 03:11:08.175]  Let's look at the person that actually started the rally.
[03:11:08.835 --> 03:11:13.561]  It's come to our attention that this is a person from Occupy Wall Street that was an Obama sympathizer.
[03:11:13.601 --> 03:11:14.522]  So wait a minute.
[03:11:14.662 --> 03:11:17.224]  Be careful where you start taking these people to.
[03:11:17.905 --> 03:11:18.866]  And look at the background.
[03:11:19.126 --> 03:11:23.351]  George Soros is one of those people that actually helps, you know, back these individuals.
[03:11:24.152 --> 03:11:24.532]  Who is he?
[03:11:25.573 --> 03:11:26.514]  I think he's from Hungary.
[03:11:26.534 --> 03:11:29.877]  I think he was Jewish and I think he turned in his own people to the Nazis.
[03:11:30.818 --> 03:11:33.181]  We better be careful of where we go with those.
[03:11:33.501 --> 03:11:38.025]  Do you think George Soros funded the Neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville?
[03:11:38.045 --> 03:11:39.447]  Wouldn't it be interesting to find out?
[03:11:41.428 --> 03:11:44.270]  Again, that was Republican Arizona Congressman Paul Gosar.
[03:11:44.711 --> 03:11:47.313]  This man, keeping him honest, does he have proof?
[03:11:47.853 --> 03:11:48.574]  No, nothing.
[03:11:48.674 --> 03:11:50.295]  In other words, it's a false flag.
[03:11:50.315 --> 03:11:54.879]  He's spreading an insulting and disgusting conspiracy theory, one that's been swiftly debunked by many.
[03:11:55.199 --> 03:11:57.161]  We asked Congressman Gosar to come on the program tonight.
[03:11:57.201 --> 03:11:58.022]  His office declined.
[03:11:58.042 --> 03:11:59.503]  We told him it's an open invitation.
[03:11:59.923 --> 03:12:00.804]  We got no reply.
[03:12:01.344 --> 03:12:05.425]  These conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[03:12:05.565 --> 03:12:22.948]  The rally in August was organized by Jason Kessler, who said he voted for President Obama and attended one Occupy event, but he also says he became disenchanted with the Obama administration, and in addition to organizing that hate-filled show... All three of the organizers were funded by Leftist groups, and they had hired actors, admitted.
[03:12:22.988 --> 03:12:25.829]  I'm not saying there wasn't real killing, but let's go further here.
[03:12:29.269 --> 03:12:34.499]  They're trying to sit there and imply... I'm actually speechless at this point.
[03:12:34.519 --> 03:12:35.541]  I mean, this is next level.
[03:12:37.109 --> 03:12:43.796]  That Cooper knows full well that Soros has admitted to being a Nazi collaborator, and they're now saying that's a conspiracy theorist.
[03:12:45.037 --> 03:12:51.463]  And notice, again, they take whatever's our strongest information, and they act like they've caught us in something, so people stop saying it.
[03:12:51.824 --> 03:12:58.530]  They take whatever's our strongest thing, like the sky's blue, the sun's yellow, they laugh at us hoping we quit, hoping we stop doing it.
[03:12:58.810 --> 03:13:00.392]  That's why they tell these bald-faced lies.
[03:13:00.652 --> 03:13:01.193]  Let's continue.
[03:13:02.414 --> 03:13:07.239]  ...has, according to Vice News, spent time on YouTube railing against what he called white genocide.
[03:13:07.839 --> 03:13:08.860]  He's certainly a charmer.
[03:13:09.121 --> 03:13:16.487]  As for billionaire investor George Soros, who does back liberal causes, a spokeswoman for his foundation issued a statement to Vice News that reads in part, quote,
[03:13:24.915 --> 03:13:26.657]  He was 14 years old when the war ended.
[03:13:26.737 --> 03:13:28.398]  He did not collaborate with the Nazis.
[03:13:28.438 --> 03:13:29.840]  He did not help round up people.
[03:13:29.880 --> 03:13:32.042]  He did not confiscate anybody's property.
[03:13:32.662 --> 03:13:33.824]  Joining me now is Ellie Reeves.
[03:13:33.844 --> 03:13:34.744]  She's the Vice News reporter.
[03:13:34.764 --> 03:13:35.205]  That's enough.
[03:13:35.225 --> 03:13:35.865]  That's enough.
[03:13:36.346 --> 03:13:37.227]  And then who's this woman?
[03:13:39.169 --> 03:13:43.733]  He says he collaborated with Nazis, and she responds, oh, he funded neo-Nazis?
[03:13:45.434 --> 03:13:47.637]  And I'm sorry, they've hired her because she looks like
[03:13:48.618 --> 03:13:49.138]  I'm sad.
[03:13:49.198 --> 03:13:51.259]  I mean, I mean, I'm kind of glad.
[03:13:51.359 --> 03:13:55.681]  I want to honor Vice hiring disabled people to be the reporters.
[03:13:55.721 --> 03:13:57.822]  But I mean, this is next level, folks.
[03:13:58.382 --> 03:14:05.565]  So here's actually George Soros on 60 Minutes saying he's not even ashamed of it, that he helped the Nazis.
[03:14:05.585 --> 03:14:07.466]  Here it is.
[03:14:07.486 --> 03:14:12.308]  These are pictures from 1944 of what happened to George Soros' friends and neighbors.
[03:14:12.868 --> 03:14:14.989]  You're a Hungarian Jew.
[03:14:16.713 --> 03:14:21.296]  Who escaped the Holocaust by posing as a Christian.
[03:14:21.536 --> 03:14:21.777]  Right.
[03:14:22.017 --> 03:14:26.900]  And you watched lots of people get shipped off to the death camps.
[03:14:26.960 --> 03:14:27.140]  Right.
[03:14:27.761 --> 03:14:28.902]  I was 14 years old.
[03:14:29.782 --> 03:14:32.324]  And I would say that that's when my character was made.
[03:14:32.344 --> 03:14:35.967]  It was a tremendous threat of evil.
[03:14:36.067 --> 03:14:38.889]  I mean, it was a very personal experience of evil.
[03:14:40.174 --> 03:14:48.697]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours, who swore that you were his adopted godson.
[03:14:48.857 --> 03:14:49.097]  Yes.
[03:14:49.958 --> 03:14:54.639]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[03:14:54.659 --> 03:14:55.019]  That's right.
[03:14:55.079 --> 03:15:03.502]  That sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years.
[03:15:04.183 --> 03:15:04.923]  Was it difficult?
[03:15:05.563 --> 03:15:08.806]  Not at all.
[03:15:09.167 --> 03:15:15.032]  It was actually probably the happiest year of my life, that year of German occupation.
[03:15:16.633 --> 03:15:17.935]  Now that's just one clip.
[03:15:18.395 --> 03:15:22.599]  I want to add to this, or get McBrain to give it to you, because it's like a 15-minute interview on there.
[03:15:23.019 --> 03:15:29.405]  He says, it taught me about markets, and if I wouldn't have helped round these people up, someone else would have done it.
[03:15:31.024 --> 03:15:33.626]  So, I know he wants to expunge the interview.
[03:15:34.187 --> 03:15:39.671]  Maybe tomorrow we should air the whole thing on air, but for some reason, we never play the real coup de grace.
[03:15:40.652 --> 03:15:41.393]  Metaphysical?
[03:15:41.873 --> 03:15:42.954]  Not meant to happen?
[03:15:43.554 --> 03:15:44.395]  Who knows?
[03:15:44.515 --> 03:15:48.459]  But something tells me, someday it will air.
[03:15:49.399 --> 03:15:50.140]  Someday.
[03:15:50.560 --> 03:15:52.202]  Maybe today's that day.
[03:16:02.315 --> 03:16:10.462]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[03:16:10.722 --> 03:16:14.405]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[03:16:15.086 --> 03:16:21.591]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[03:16:21.791 --> 03:16:25.134]  So I'm offering for the first time ever, 50% off.
[03:16:25.454 --> 03:16:27.256]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[03:16:27.896 --> 03:16:36.304]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[03:16:36.344 --> 03:16:37.285]  They know how great it is.
[03:16:38.206 --> 03:16:42.029]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[03:16:42.810 --> 03:16:44.271]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[03:16:45.092 --> 03:16:52.975]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[03:16:53.395 --> 03:17:01.898]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[03:17:02.438 --> 03:17:04.859]  That comes to 50.03.
[03:17:05.179 --> 03:17:09.040]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[03:17:09.460 --> 03:17:12.421]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[03:17:14.762 --> 03:17:15.643]  It's a good deal at $39.

[03:18:26.690 --> 03:18:35.563]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth, Turmeric Chaga Mushroom Bee Pollen, and more.
[03:18:36.104 --> 03:18:36.745]  Concentrate.
[03:18:36.765 --> 03:18:38.546]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[03:18:38.826 --> 03:18:40.247]  Next level compared to whey.
[03:18:40.447 --> 03:18:42.089]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:18:42.509 --> 03:18:43.370]  It's incredible.
[03:18:43.850 --> 03:18:45.771]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[03:18:45.952 --> 03:18:47.092]  It's bigger than I am already.
[03:18:47.553 --> 03:18:48.453]  At 15, incredible.
[03:18:48.774 --> 03:18:49.674]  It is amazing.
[03:18:50.015 --> 03:18:51.296]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:18:51.736 --> 03:18:52.857]  50% off Caveman.
[03:18:53.077 --> 03:18:54.398]  But only a few days left.
[03:18:54.658 --> 03:18:55.399]  It's about to end.
[03:18:55.999 --> 03:18:58.341]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[03:18:58.761 --> 03:19:03.944]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[03:19:04.365 --> 03:19:05.765]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[03:19:06.006 --> 03:19:07.166]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[03:19:07.547 --> 03:19:08.367]  I want to thank you.
[03:19:08.687 --> 03:19:09.728]  We're all in this together.
[03:19:09.748 --> 03:19:20.155]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[03:19:26.880 --> 03:19:36.307]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[03:19:36.567 --> 03:19:41.911]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[03:19:55.677 --> 03:20:00.498]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[03:20:05.699 --> 03:20:08.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.763 --> 03:20:17.486]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours.
[03:20:17.726 --> 03:20:18.627]  Yes.
[03:20:19.147 --> 03:20:22.609]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[03:20:22.690 --> 03:20:23.110]  That's right.
[03:20:24.864 --> 03:20:25.564]  Was it difficult?
[03:20:28.805 --> 03:20:29.265]  Not at all.
[03:20:29.645 --> 03:20:30.266]  Not at all.
[03:20:30.986 --> 03:20:34.827]  Maybe as a child, you don't see the connection.
[03:20:35.527 --> 03:20:37.668]  It created no problem at all.
[03:20:37.748 --> 03:20:38.608]  No feeling of guilt?
[03:20:39.048 --> 03:20:39.168]  No.
[03:20:39.649 --> 03:20:50.172]  Well, actually, in a funny way, it's just like in markets, that if I weren't there, somebody else would be taking it away anyhow.
[03:20:50.632 --> 03:20:53.793]  Whether I was there or not, the property was being taken away.
[03:20:55.299 --> 03:20:56.600]  So I had no sense of guilt.
[03:20:57.481 --> 03:21:01.624]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:21:02.365 --> 03:21:03.786]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:21:08.160 --> 03:21:10.601]  By the way, the article's up on InfoWars.com.
[03:21:11.322 --> 03:21:16.945]  CNN now claims that George Soros was not a Nazi collaborator, and that we have made it up.
[03:21:17.705 --> 03:21:23.068]  The full, what is it, 14-minute interview he did for 60 Minutes is posted in our article.
[03:21:23.408 --> 03:21:25.149]  This is next-level BS.
[03:21:25.589 --> 03:21:27.090]  Now, I'm going to turn the show over to Roger Shultz.
[03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:31.652]  He's got a congressman coming on with huge, groundbreaking news and information.
[03:21:31.672 --> 03:21:33.873]  I'm going to turn this over right now, Roger, but just briefly.
[03:21:34.373 --> 03:21:36.875]  What do you make of CNN's latest
[03:21:37.595 --> 03:21:45.028]  venture into complete fairytale fake news defending a Nazi collaborator and saying that I made it up.
[03:21:45.448 --> 03:21:46.771]  What in the world is going on?
[03:21:48.237 --> 03:21:51.318]  This is the epitome of fake news.
[03:21:51.338 --> 03:21:55.820]  You know, I used to like Anderson Cooper, but this is a bridge too far.
[03:21:56.421 --> 03:22:10.127]  Reminds me of a piece of legislation that Congressman Adam Schiff introduced last week, Alex, which declares that the federal government has never paid out a penny to anyone who was damaged by vaccines.
[03:22:11.095 --> 03:22:12.356]  Well, we know that that's false.
[03:22:12.416 --> 03:22:16.057]  They've paid out almost $3.7 billion.
[03:22:16.697 --> 03:22:20.119]  It's the same kind of denial that you see here.
[03:22:20.719 --> 03:22:26.982]  It is widely established that Soros was a Nazi collaborator.
[03:22:27.482 --> 03:22:33.505]  He is, as you can see, he exudes absolute stone-cold evil.
[03:22:34.725 --> 03:22:42.387]  And foreign intelligence services in numerous countries have documented his Nazi collaboration.
[03:22:42.867 --> 03:22:53.049]  So this is an attempt by CNN, not a news organization, to reinvent history, to bury the truth with the big lie.
[03:22:53.389 --> 03:22:56.649]  This is a classic of the big lie technique.
[03:22:57.069 --> 03:22:59.830]  And Alex, I'm a little jealous because they're blaming you.
[03:23:01.647 --> 03:23:02.968]  Roger, I didn't get a big show.
[03:23:03.008 --> 03:23:03.709]  Sorry I cut in.
[03:23:03.729 --> 03:23:05.470]  Please take over StoneColdTruth.com.
[03:23:07.332 --> 03:23:08.152]  No problem at all.
[03:23:08.212 --> 03:23:12.536]  This, I think, was in fact extremely newsworthy, Alex.
[03:23:12.556 --> 03:23:21.143]  I have never seen CNN go quite this far in their Orwellian attempts to deny reality.
[03:23:22.540 --> 03:23:34.408]  There is more and more reports from the Trump White House about discord between the President and his Chief of Staff, General John Kelly.
[03:23:34.989 --> 03:23:47.017]  Jack Posobiec, who often appears here at Infowars, reported several days ago that Kelly had tendered his resignation some weeks ago.
[03:23:47.677 --> 03:23:51.540]  Now, I've seen this bureaucratic trick before.
[03:23:52.320 --> 03:23:59.363]  Under Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger tendered his resignation roughly once every 10 days.
[03:24:00.283 --> 03:24:05.105]  Al Haig, later the White House Chief of Staff, picked up this same technique.
[03:24:05.185 --> 03:24:11.308]  They're not really quitting, you understand, and they don't want the President to take them up on their offer.
[03:24:11.808 --> 03:24:14.769]  It's an attempt to pressure the President.
[03:24:15.673 --> 03:24:33.300]  What I can report is that Kelly has done an effective job of bringing down a de facto iron curtain around our president, controlling all written and human communications that reach the president from the outside.
[03:24:34.120 --> 03:24:42.363]  With the exception of those communications that are engendered when the president picks up the phone or when he asks
[03:24:42.816 --> 03:24:46.159]  For a specific piece of information.
[03:24:46.840 --> 03:25:03.736]  Now, it seems to me that there was an important piece in Vanity Fair today by Gabriel Sherman, who, to my mind, is one of the better political reporters in Washington and the Washington, New York access.
[03:25:06.036 --> 03:25:22.811]  In this piece, Sherman correctly points out that the season, meaning winter, when the beautiful people, when high society goes to Palm Beach, is going to pose a specific challenge to General Kelly.
[03:25:22.871 --> 03:25:27.235]  You see, the president is an extraordinarily social animal.
[03:25:27.992 --> 03:25:31.854]  He, unlike Hillary Clinton, he actually likes people.
[03:25:32.395 --> 03:25:33.816]  He likes to mix with them.
[03:25:33.876 --> 03:25:35.136]  He likes to talk to them.
[03:25:35.176 --> 03:25:36.897]  He likes to get ideas from them.
[03:25:37.238 --> 03:25:41.020]  He likes to bounce his ideas off of them and see what they think.
[03:25:41.713 --> 03:25:46.015]  He's a gregarious extrovert in an extrovert's job.
[03:25:46.635 --> 03:26:03.802]  And when he goes to his stunning compound in Palm Beach, the Mar-a-Lago Club, well, on any given night, you can find him in the dining room, holding court, meeting with friends, old and new, and really very much in his element.
[03:26:04.442 --> 03:26:11.205]  The problem with that, of course, is that it violates the new protocol set up by General Kelly.
[03:26:12.017 --> 03:26:30.318]  The idea of taking the president to this palatial private club where he has an embedded residence, kind of a luxury apartment, but separating him from his many friends and guests, well, that will be a very, very tall order.
[03:26:30.939 --> 03:26:45.509]  For example, the conservative publisher Christopher Ruddy, a friend of Infowars, a friend of mine, a member of the Mar-a-Lago Club, someone often seen at the president's elbow in the wintertime.
[03:26:46.089 --> 03:26:47.230]  I could name others.
[03:26:47.270 --> 03:26:52.994]  In fact, I wouldn't be shocked if Alex Jones and Roger Stone show up for dinner one night.
[03:26:53.644 --> 03:26:57.946]  So, General Kelly's work is really cut out for him.
[03:26:58.426 --> 03:27:05.390]  The president is not, like some child, going to be kept in the dark and fed disinformation.
[03:27:05.470 --> 03:27:09.332]  That's not the Donald Trump that I know.
[03:27:10.132 --> 03:27:12.454]  Keep an eye on General Kelly.
[03:27:13.594 --> 03:27:16.736]  I don't know that he'll be there after February.
[03:27:17.521 --> 03:27:24.006]  You can only pull the I quit, I'm tendering my resignation act so many times.
[03:27:24.487 --> 03:27:29.571]  I think it is likely that the good general will overplay his hand.
[03:27:30.551 --> 03:27:42.701]  Since you're with us here on InfoWars, I'd really appreciate it personally if you'd go to the InfoWars.com store, where they have an extraordinary special on brain force.
[03:27:43.580 --> 03:27:52.542]  I would have to say of all the products available in the entire InfoWars.com line, this is without any question my favorite.
[03:27:52.622 --> 03:27:59.104]  For me it gives me mental clarity, mental organization, mental energy as it were.
[03:27:59.204 --> 03:28:02.705]  Kind of helps you collect your thoughts and focus them.
[03:28:02.745 --> 03:28:04.245]  This is a terrific
[03:28:05.416 --> 03:28:05.876]  Product.
[03:28:06.076 --> 03:28:13.061]  I can tell you firsthand that it works because I was writing last night till almost 3 a.m.
[03:28:13.541 --> 03:28:20.985]  Got up this morning for early meetings and here I am on InfoWars now and in the next hour.
[03:28:21.085 --> 03:28:27.129]  Speaking of the rest of our show, Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida will join us to talk about
[03:28:27.981 --> 03:28:34.885]  Attorney General Jeff Sessions and why there has been no examination of the Clinton Foundation.
[03:28:35.045 --> 03:28:37.647]  I'm Roger Stone and I'll be right back.
[03:29:02.441 --> 03:29:10.586]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[03:29:10.846 --> 03:29:14.528]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[03:29:15.188 --> 03:29:21.692]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[03:29:21.912 --> 03:29:25.254]  So I'm offering for the first time ever, 50% off.
[03:29:25.554 --> 03:29:27.355]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[03:29:27.995 --> 03:29:36.423]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[03:29:36.463 --> 03:29:37.404]  They know how great it is.
[03:29:38.325 --> 03:29:42.128]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[03:29:42.949 --> 03:29:44.370]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[03:29:45.211 --> 03:29:53.076]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.

[03:30:09.587 --> 03:30:12.549]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[03:30:14.890 --> 03:30:15.750]  It's a good deal at $39.

[03:31:36.235 --> 03:31:36.856]  Concentrate.
[03:31:36.896 --> 03:31:38.657]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[03:31:38.938 --> 03:31:40.299]  Next level compared to whey.
[03:31:40.319 --> 03:31:42.221]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:31:42.621 --> 03:31:43.502]  It's incredible.
[03:31:43.983 --> 03:31:45.884]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[03:31:46.065 --> 03:31:48.027]  It's bigger than I am already at 15.
[03:31:48.107 --> 03:31:48.587]  Incredible.
[03:31:48.907 --> 03:31:49.788]  It is amazing.
[03:31:50.149 --> 03:31:51.870]  Infowarslife.com.

[03:31:54.773 --> 03:31:55.554]  It's about to end.
[03:31:56.134 --> 03:31:58.457]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[03:31:58.897 --> 03:31:59.838]  We're the tip of the spear

[03:32:04.480 --> 03:32:05.140]  The globalists win.
[03:32:05.160 --> 03:32:05.860]  We're all slaves.
[03:32:06.120 --> 03:32:07.280]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[03:32:07.661 --> 03:32:08.481]  I want to thank you.

[03:33:05.647 --> 03:33:08.268]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.161 --> 03:33:28.744]  Hi, this is former mayor and the greatest mayor, Mr. 9-11 Rudy Giuliani.
[03:33:29.065 --> 03:33:31.947]  And you're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[03:33:43.335 --> 03:33:44.076]  Welcome back.
[03:33:44.536 --> 03:33:49.220]  I'm Roger Stone and you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:50.080 --> 03:33:57.322]  Joining me now is one of the most impressive, young, hard-charging conservatives in the U.S.
[03:33:57.382 --> 03:34:02.464]  Congress, Matt Gaetz of the 1st District of Florida.
[03:34:03.425 --> 03:34:08.826]  Matt Gaetz first came to my attention when he was a member of the Florida House.
[03:34:09.527 --> 03:34:19.470]  He is a take-no-prisoners conservative in the Reagan mold, someone whom great things are expected of,
[03:34:20.250 --> 03:34:44.620]  And he has emerged as a substantial critic of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, specifically in regard to the foibles of the Clinton Foundation, and why there doesn't seem to be any current federal investigation of the violations of both law and IRS regulation going on there.
[03:34:45.321 --> 03:34:47.812]  Joining me now, Congressman Matt Gaetz.
[03:34:47.892 --> 03:34:49.841]  Matt, welcome to InfoWars.
[03:34:50.578 --> 03:34:52.159]  It's good to be on with you, Roger.
[03:34:52.719 --> 03:35:07.028]  You know, it is so frustrating that after a rule-of-law election that we had to send Donald Trump to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, we still have not seen a thorough, robust investigation of the Clinton Foundation.
[03:35:07.088 --> 03:35:08.729]  And here's why that's important.
[03:35:09.070 --> 03:35:17.675]  We may have people around the world who purport to be acting on behalf of the United States government where there really wasn't an arms-length transaction.
[03:35:18.055 --> 03:35:32.410]  They just got a designation or a contract or some special treatment because they made some donation to the Clinton Foundation and so let me set the stage for you and for our viewers regarding how this issue came to be in the House Judiciary Committee.
[03:35:32.931 --> 03:35:36.455]  Each and every week in the House Judiciary Committee we've got Democrats
[03:35:37.115 --> 03:35:51.764]  Lobbing these crazy resolutions about Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Donald Trump, Jared Kushner, and frankly I was sick and tired of hearing about it while the American people are expecting us to be delivering on our promises.
[03:35:51.824 --> 03:36:05.692]  And so I filed an amendment to strip every word of the Democrat resolution and to put into that legislation a demand from the House Judiciary Committee that we get to the bottom of what's going on with the Clinton Foundation.
[03:36:06.192 --> 03:36:14.462]  You know, is there a situation with Fusion GPS that made this false dossier on President Trump that we need to know about?
[03:36:14.482 --> 03:36:22.010]  The Uranium One deal that you've covered to a great extent on InfoWars remains really something that hasn't been investigated.
[03:36:22.791 --> 03:36:38.460]  I've been joined by some of my colleagues in the Congress calling for a special counsel to be appointed by Jeff Sessions or his designee to take this matter up and really get to the bottom of whether or not the United States government was sold out by Hillary Clinton.
[03:36:40.081 --> 03:36:47.005]  Matt, what kind of a response have you gotten both from your colleagues in the House and of course from the Justice Department?
[03:36:48.095 --> 03:37:08.455]  Well, in the House, I've had a couple dozen people join me in sponsoring a resolution calling for this special counsel, but with 218 Republicans, we certainly, or with more than that, I'm sorry, with more than 240 Republicans, it's a shame that we don't have more than about 10% of the conference signing on to do this real investigation.
[03:37:08.895 --> 03:37:13.416]  As for Attorney General Sessions, I really wish that there was a stronger response.
[03:37:13.816 --> 03:37:24.818]  He has deferred all issues regarding Russia to Mr. Rosenstein, and I just don't get the sense that Rosenstein is really interested in taking up an investigation of Hillary Clinton.
[03:37:25.178 --> 03:37:37.761]  He seems to be more interested in looking into Donald Trump, and, you know, it would be really disappointing, Roger, if just by losing an election, Hillary Clinton got some sort of de facto immunity deal.
[03:37:38.081 --> 03:37:41.144]  That doesn't seem fair to me and I don't think it seems fair to the American people.
[03:37:42.405 --> 03:37:45.167]  It does seem like she has gotten a pass.
[03:37:45.247 --> 03:37:54.535]  Now obviously when you talk about the Clinton Foundation or the Clinton scandals, sure there's a big piece of this that has to do with Russia.
[03:37:54.615 --> 03:38:01.881]  We now know that John Podesta and his brother were making millions of dollars from the clique around Putin.
[03:38:02.581 --> 03:38:09.962]  Bill and Hillary were paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees to give 15-minute speeches in Moscow.
[03:38:11.163 --> 03:38:17.664]  In Bill's case, that's a thinly disguised bribe, in my opinion.
[03:38:17.724 --> 03:38:28.546]  But there is so much more there, particularly the abuse in the wake of the Haitian earthquake, where literally millions of dollars have disappeared.
[03:38:29.506 --> 03:38:38.409]  It boggles the mind that no one at the Trump Justice Department seems to be at all interested in this regard.
[03:38:39.049 --> 03:38:39.809]  What are the next steps?
[03:38:39.829 --> 03:38:40.510]  Well, I think they're scared, Roger.
[03:38:41.150 --> 03:38:42.750]  Yeah, Roger, I think that they're scared.
[03:38:42.850 --> 03:38:44.671]  I mean, the facts are there.
[03:38:44.871 --> 03:38:58.615]  We have evidence that suggests that the Clinton campaign was working in concert with Fusion GPS to proliferate false dossiers about President Trump, both before and after his election, in order to discredit him.
[03:38:58.935 --> 03:39:05.158]  That is the only evidence that there is with a Russia connection to this election that is out of the ordinary.
[03:39:05.198 --> 03:39:15.643]  I mean, of course Russia throughout the world engages in efforts to try to manipulate the national discussion and the global discussion of human events and affairs.
[03:39:15.703 --> 03:39:17.103]  That's not anything new.
[03:39:17.183 --> 03:39:22.906]  What's new is that it looks like there was this Russian firm that may have been connected to the Clinton campaign.
[03:39:23.186 --> 03:39:24.987]  Now you've asked about next steps.
[03:39:25.447 --> 03:39:27.548]  I think it's very disappointing that
[03:39:28.650 --> 03:39:36.319]  Attorney General Sessions has taken the position that his recusal on the Russia question means that he won't investigate the Clinton Foundation.
[03:39:37.000 --> 03:39:37.901]  You mentioned Haiti.
[03:39:38.242 --> 03:39:48.514]  There are a number of other circumstances where the Clinton Foundation was essentially a money laundering operation, where they would take donations in exchange for special access
[03:39:48.994 --> 03:39:52.259]  Special favors and special treatment with the State Department.
[03:39:52.519 --> 03:39:54.141]  That goes well beyond Russia.
[03:39:54.222 --> 03:40:05.818]  So I believe it is entirely within the discretion of Attorney General Sessions to appoint a special counsel, but he has chosen to take a pass on that and to give all the authority to Rosenstein.
[03:40:06.158 --> 03:40:12.525]  Who no one elected and who, you know, was not someone that certainly I think the President has tremendous confidence in.
[03:40:12.866 --> 03:40:17.551]  And so I'm looking forward to a circumstance where we get that special counsel appointed.
[03:40:17.611 --> 03:40:19.033]  That really is the next step.
[03:40:19.333 --> 03:40:26.962]  We need a special counsel pursuing Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation because otherwise we send the message to the American people
[03:40:27.342 --> 03:40:35.429]  That if someone loses an election, whatever their crimes are, whatever violations of the law they were involved in, they're immediately forgiven upon losing an election.
[03:40:35.549 --> 03:40:40.433]  And that is not the type of sense that the American people have.
[03:40:40.773 --> 03:40:44.537]  We elected Donald Trump because we want to see the rule of law enforced.
[03:40:44.877 --> 03:40:49.301]  You know, I see on the screen now, our viewers are able to see this connection to Loretta Lynch.
[03:40:49.641 --> 03:40:52.603]  That's another issue that we think deserves an investigation.
[03:40:52.924 --> 03:40:54.225]  Why did Loretta Lynch
[03:40:54.685 --> 03:41:02.668]  Tell James Comey to go and lie to the American people and call the Clinton investigation a matter instead of an investigation.
[03:41:02.688 --> 03:41:03.729]  You remember that, Roger?
[03:41:04.009 --> 03:41:09.251]  I mean, that was the Attorney General of the United States telling the FBI Director to go and lie to the American people.
[03:41:09.511 --> 03:41:16.734]  And the fact that as a Judiciary Committee, as a Congress, we have not investigated that, that really gives me a great sense of discomfort.
[03:41:18.067 --> 03:41:26.210]  The Democrats have always been much better than the Republicans when it came to weaponizing the legal system and the judicial system.
[03:41:27.130 --> 03:41:34.513]  While we're at it, that special prosecutor you refer to can look into these FISA court declarations that indicate that
[03:41:36.393 --> 03:41:45.775]  30,000 Americans were illegally and unconstitutionally surveilled by the Obama NSA, yet no one has brought an action against Ms.
[03:41:45.855 --> 03:41:58.878]  Rice, Mr. Brennan, Admiral Rogers, and Mr. Clapper, a proven perjurer who lied to the Congress about the fact that he said we had no metadata collection program.
[03:41:59.738 --> 03:42:05.741]  This is extraordinarily important stuff, but the Democrats seem to be getting a pass.
[03:42:06.261 --> 03:42:14.544]  Matt, if you'll stick with us, I'd like to bring you back in the next segment, because there's a couple other issues in the Congress I want to pick your brain about.
[03:42:14.984 --> 03:42:16.505]  You're at InfoWars.
[03:42:16.705 --> 03:42:20.326]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:42:20.426 --> 03:42:27.129]  And if you like our programming, if you like the way that we are carrying the flag for freedom,
[03:42:27.609 --> 03:42:34.915]  Well, then I ask you to go to the InfoWars.com site now and look at our terrific product line.
[03:42:34.935 --> 03:42:37.517]  40% off Survival Shield.
[03:42:37.717 --> 03:42:40.919]  That's an extraordinary price.
[03:42:40.939 --> 03:42:43.181]  50% off my favorite, Brain Force.
[03:42:43.201 --> 03:42:49.225]  You see, we don't have a George Soros sitting in the wings writing us big checks.
[03:42:49.626 --> 03:42:52.087]  We can only depend on you.
[03:42:52.828 --> 03:42:53.889]  I will be right back.
[03:43:02.782 --> 03:43:10.926]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[03:43:11.186 --> 03:43:14.868]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[03:43:15.548 --> 03:43:22.051]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[03:43:22.251 --> 03:43:25.593]  So I'm offering for the first time ever, 50% off.
[03:43:25.913 --> 03:43:27.714]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[03:43:28.354 --> 03:43:36.782]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[03:43:36.802 --> 03:43:37.763]  They know how great it is.
[03:43:38.684 --> 03:43:42.487]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[03:43:42.507 --> 03:43:44.729]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[03:43:45.570 --> 03:43:53.437]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.

[03:44:02.904 --> 03:44:05.346]  That comes to 50.03.
[03:44:05.466 --> 03:44:09.530]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[03:44:09.930 --> 03:44:12.832]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[03:44:15.234 --> 03:44:16.094]  It's a good deal at $39.

[03:45:36.585 --> 03:45:37.226]  Concentrate.
[03:45:37.246 --> 03:45:39.027]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[03:45:39.288 --> 03:45:40.729]  Next level compared to whey.
[03:45:40.949 --> 03:45:42.571]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:45:42.971 --> 03:45:43.852]  It's incredible.
[03:45:44.332 --> 03:45:46.234]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[03:45:46.414 --> 03:45:48.376]  It's bigger than I am already at 15.
[03:45:48.456 --> 03:45:48.936]  Incredible.
[03:45:49.257 --> 03:45:50.137]  It is amazing.
[03:45:50.498 --> 03:45:51.779]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:45:52.540 --> 03:45:53.320]  50% off Caveman.
[03:45:53.541 --> 03:45:54.882]  But only a few days left.
[03:45:55.122 --> 03:45:55.883]  It's about to end.
[03:45:56.463 --> 03:45:58.804]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[03:45:59.244 --> 03:46:04.406]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[03:46:04.826 --> 03:46:06.227]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[03:46:06.467 --> 03:46:07.627]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[03:46:08.007 --> 03:46:08.828]  I want to thank you.
[03:46:09.148 --> 03:46:10.208]  We're all in this together.
[03:46:10.728 --> 03:46:20.652]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[03:46:37.024 --> 03:46:42.368]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[03:46:56.138 --> 03:47:00.981]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[03:47:05.084 --> 03:47:07.685]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.056 --> 03:47:27.579]  This is Bernie Sanders, and there's a lot of corruption in this country.
[03:47:28.040 --> 03:47:33.625]  And if you want to hear about corruption, then you'll listen to Roger Stone on InfoWatch, because he tells the truth.
[03:47:38.374 --> 03:47:47.500]  Some vintage Rolling Stones there, a tune written by Chuck Berry, and of course my good friend Senator Bernie Sanders.
[03:47:48.421 --> 03:47:59.748]  Congressman Matt Gaetz was called to the House floor for a vote, so we're gonna give him a pass, but he's promised to come back and talk to us about the amendment that he's working on.
[03:48:00.728 --> 03:48:15.857]  That would have the effect of prohibiting the federal government from using DOJ funds for a crackdown on marijuana in the 29 states that have legalized it under state law.
[03:48:16.517 --> 03:48:26.623]  Matt Gaetz has been a real crusader on this issue and he'll be back on InfoWars soon to give us an update on that important issue.
[03:48:27.919 --> 03:48:38.327]  Also in the news, for those of you who may not have seen it, was an extraordinary 60 Minutes interview with a gentleman named Brad Pascal.
[03:48:38.868 --> 03:48:46.935]  Mr. Pascal was the digital advertising director for the Donald Trump for President campaign.
[03:48:47.836 --> 03:48:53.981]  And I think Mr. Pascal's interview comes at a very timely occasion.
[03:48:54.942 --> 03:49:16.464]  It is now that we're just starting to get a focus on the digital advertising campaign that was conducted by, allegedly, by the Russians, and whether it was effective, how much they spent, and whether it really moved any votes.
[03:49:17.353 --> 03:49:41.467]  Given the fact that the amounts of money spent appear to be in the hundreds of thousands, and that the number of people who voted in this election were in the millions, it's doubtful, in my opinion, that the Russians did much in terms of actually moving votes for or against Donald Trump.
[03:49:42.067 --> 03:49:46.270]  Also, if you have seen the actual copy, the text of their ads,
[03:49:47.085 --> 03:49:52.770]  Well, they look like they were written by someone who has Russian as a first language.
[03:49:52.970 --> 03:49:59.495]  I was having a hard time trying to figure out exactly what it was they were trying to say.
[03:50:00.582 --> 03:50:22.089]  Mr. Pascal, starting with a Forbes Magazine profile, which was really a profile on the President's son-in-law immediately after the election, has claimed an inordinate amount of credit for the election of Donald Trump through his alleged digital campaign efforts.
[03:50:23.534 --> 03:50:31.400]  There is, I think, an inadvertent downside to Mr. Pascal's appearance on 60 Minutes.
[03:50:32.021 --> 03:50:38.666]  You see, he was paid $94 million by the Trump campaign.
[03:50:39.387 --> 03:50:43.210]  It is my understanding, from sources that I learned about this morning,
[03:50:43.760 --> 03:50:54.428]  That members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committee are going to be asking Mr. Pascal to document where the $94 million went.
[03:50:55.408 --> 03:51:07.277]  I can tell you firsthand that the New York Times tried to determine this some many months ago and were unable to do so from public records and logs.
[03:51:08.078 --> 03:51:15.668]  Perhaps Mr. Pascal can show us what he did with $94 million.
[03:51:16.269 --> 03:51:20.915]  We'll keep you updated on this story as it develops.
[03:51:22.127 --> 03:51:41.712]  Steve Bannon, now also in the wake of the extraordinary victory in Alabama by Judge Roy Moore, which many read as a rejection of Senator Mitch McConnell and the Republican leadership in the Senate.
[03:51:42.721 --> 03:51:50.907]  Mr. Bannon has now gone on a jihad against the RINO wing of the Republican Party.
[03:51:51.427 --> 03:51:52.468]  Let me be clear.
[03:51:52.828 --> 03:51:56.710]  It's a jihad that I enthusiastically, 100% support.
[03:51:59.944 --> 03:52:14.560]  I always thought that Steve Bannon, who really is a good guy, would be more effective as a rabble rouser and an outsider than he was trying to fit into the button-down culture of the White House.
[03:52:15.340 --> 03:52:21.407]  And indeed, Bannon has made great waves since leaving the White House.
[03:52:22.210 --> 03:52:35.324]  Toppling Senator McConnell's choice in Alabama and now targeting a group of rhino Republicans who have been backstabbing the president.
[03:52:36.005 --> 03:52:38.127]  Now, I know the mainstream media
[03:52:38.897 --> 03:52:55.422]  This narrative tells you that Robert Corker of Tennessee left the Senate in some fit of conscience, that he has been attacking the president, thus being deified by the mainstream media.
[03:52:55.942 --> 03:53:00.784]  But if you're following us here at InfoWars, you know that the truth is far different.
[03:53:00.804 --> 03:53:05.565]  You see, Senator Corker got out of Dodge just ahead of the posse.
[03:53:06.713 --> 03:53:25.547]  The FBI and the SEC have been examining a series of trades and other business dealings to determine whether Senator Corker was taking information that he learned on a proprietary basis as a member of the U.S.
[03:53:25.607 --> 03:53:33.693]  Senate and then using that to invest or make trades in hedge funds or other public companies.
[03:53:34.494 --> 03:53:37.176]  This, of course, would be highly illegal.
[03:53:37.917 --> 03:54:02.394]  Among the focus of the investigation is a particular company where Senator Mark Warner and Senator Bob Corker came together to put together the money to short housing stocks, garnering tens of millions of dollars of profit.
[03:54:03.749 --> 03:54:08.680]  I assure you, federal investigators will continue to be looking at that.
[03:54:10.151 --> 03:54:13.992]  In any event, Mr. Bannon has his work cut out for him.
[03:54:14.552 --> 03:54:21.693]  Not all of these Republican primaries will be as straightforward as Alabama.
[03:54:22.174 --> 03:54:32.196]  Now, recognize that Alabama has a two-tiered process, that there were four candidates in the first election.
[03:54:33.216 --> 03:54:38.457]  The two top vote-getters then ran off in the Republican Party.
[03:54:39.125 --> 03:54:45.247]  Watch for the Democrats to make a major play to win in Alabama.
[03:54:45.707 --> 03:54:54.211]  The argument will be that Judge Roy Moore is too far to the right, too far out of the Republican mainstream.
[03:54:55.051 --> 03:55:05.955]  Unfortunately, the Democratic candidate, Jim Douglas, by going to his website, seems to have embraced abortion as his signature issue.
[03:55:07.037 --> 03:55:08.158]  I'll be very clear.
[03:55:08.638 --> 03:55:10.539]  Doug Jones, pardon me, I correct myself.
[03:55:11.199 --> 03:55:16.682]  Mr. Jones is going to find that that dog in Alabama will not, in my opinion, hunt.
[03:55:17.423 --> 03:55:26.308]  In order to pull off an upset victory, well, Doug Jones would have to run as if he were Senator Manchin from West Virginia.
[03:55:26.388 --> 03:55:30.970]  He would have to run to the right of the base of his entire party.
[03:55:31.651 --> 03:55:34.132]  And so far, he is not doing that.
[03:55:34.955 --> 03:55:40.260]  If you want my prediction, I think Roy Moore is headed for the U.S.
[03:55:40.300 --> 03:55:47.286]  Senate, and I think Steve Bannon is headed for more upset victories around the country.
[03:55:47.887 --> 03:55:56.915]  As far, for example, as Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, well, I think you can kiss Senator Flake goodbye.
[03:55:57.836 --> 03:55:59.237]  It's really a shame
[03:55:59.890 --> 03:56:11.062]  That President Trump was talked into endorsing John McCain in 2016 when McCain was pressed in a Republican primary.
[03:56:11.922 --> 03:56:13.884]  He, too, could have been beaten.
[03:56:14.485 --> 03:56:20.431]  And what has the president gotten for his warm endorsement of the good senator from Arizona?
[03:56:21.392 --> 03:56:21.813]  Treachery.
[03:56:23.044 --> 03:56:37.445]  Backstabbing, skullduggery, and an alignment with the most liberal of Democrats on the most important issues of the day, principally, of course, the health care issue.
[03:56:38.283 --> 03:56:53.170]  John McCain needs to come before the Senate and answer questions about why he was meeting with Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who's known as a money man for, yes, Vladimir Putin.
[03:56:53.870 --> 03:57:07.937]  In fact, John McCain met with Mr. Deripaska despite warnings from our intelligence services that Deripaska was most likely a Kremlin agent and such a meeting could be questionable.
[03:57:08.672 --> 03:57:12.294]  So the mainstream media was absolutely right.
[03:57:12.995 --> 03:57:16.837]  There was a Republican candidate in bed with Putin.
[03:57:17.177 --> 03:57:22.701]  There was a Republican candidate for president playing footsies with the Russians.
[03:57:23.502 --> 03:57:26.083]  But that candidate was John McCain.
[03:57:26.784 --> 03:57:28.785]  I'm Roger Stone, and I'll be right back.
[03:57:40.720 --> 03:57:43.507]  Baby, baby I'm gonna leave you
[03:57:52.117 --> 03:57:55.958]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:57:55.998 --> 03:57:57.838]  We are under constant attack.
[03:57:58.338 --> 03:58:00.539]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[03:58:00.759 --> 03:58:03.639]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[03:58:03.679 --> 03:58:17.982]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[03:58:18.702 --> 03:58:20.323]  They can't get to us that way.
[03:58:20.703 --> 03:58:23.525]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[03:58:23.545 --> 03:58:24.526]  They don't have that power.
[03:58:25.006 --> 03:58:27.528]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[03:58:27.888 --> 03:58:30.290]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[03:58:30.730 --> 03:58:33.572]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:58:33.592 --> 03:58:35.233]  This is by listener request.
[03:58:35.473 --> 03:58:40.716]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[03:58:40.736 --> 03:58:41.317]  Again,
[03:58:42.057 --> 03:58:47.803]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, you're absolutely insane.
[03:58:48.223 --> 03:58:52.528]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[03:58:53.108 --> 03:58:58.233]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[03:58:58.254 --> 03:58:59.715]  So you're gonna
