[00:00:00.956 --> 00:00:08.840]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:16.744]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:00:16.744 --> 00:00:18.845]  As president, I will make it clear.
[00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:25.047]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:30.448]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:00:30.448 --> 00:00:33.829]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.870]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.431]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:00:41.832 --> 00:00:44.196]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:47.902]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:55.794]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:00:57.697 --> 00:00:58.197]  The U.S.
[00:00:58.197 --> 00:01:02.180]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:10.167]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:12.889]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:17.192]  Of course not, because she's... Look, there's a really loud noise.
[00:01:17.192 --> 00:01:21.275]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:23.477]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:01:27.318 --> 00:01:31.272]  When the President gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:24.703]  Now, that was a viral video we put out in the last weeks of the campaign last year, and here we are, four plus months later, in 2017, and Kim Jong-un, the hereditary dictator of North Korea, fully backed by Communist China, the biggest mass murderers in history, who we had a huge war with and lost more troops than Vietnam,
[00:02:26.977 --> 00:02:30.042]  From June 25, 1950 to July 27, 1953, three years, one month, and two days.
[00:02:30.042 --> 00:02:32.686]  A lot of my family fought in that war.
[00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:42.363]  Clint Eastwood was in that war.
[00:02:42.363 --> 00:02:51.072]  It was bigger than Vietnam, the casualties, but it was the World War II generation, so a big deal didn't get made about it in the news.
[00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:59.441]  But millions of Chinese fought on the side of the North, poured in, Douglas MacArthur wanted to use atomic weapons on them, and he was relieved of command.
[00:03:01.803 --> 00:03:07.947]  Should have used the atomic weapons then, before China had atomics, when the Russians didn't have a big atomic force.
[00:03:07.947 --> 00:03:21.275]  And the whole world would be different now, but we left hardcore Maoists slash Leninists in power, and they always create the same nightmare hell of starving people, an absolute hell.
[00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:33.736]  And so now they're firing intermediate range missiles that have thousand kilometer range into the sea right off the coast of Japan and it's safe.
[00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:57.779]  We're preparing to put atomic bombs on these and we're going to preemptively destroy, if one shot is fired, even by accident, or we hear a car backfire, literally, they've said, we hear fireworks go off on the DMZ, we're going, these are quotes, we're going to destroy Seoul and we're going to destroy Tokyo with atomic bombs.
[00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.000]  And why do they have atomic bombs?
[00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:08.953]  Because Bill Clinton and the Democrats in the 90s transferred the reactors and the systems and the delivery systems to North Korea.
[00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.570]  And China has transferred more.
[00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.570]  Total and complete insanity.
[00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:31.796]  But Communist China is buying up Hollywood, it's the biggest lobbyist group now in DC, and the Democrats and the Republican leadership are allied with them, and they have made the decision to try to remove our president and capitulate to China and the globalists, and that's all part of George Soros' and Henry Kissinger's plan.
[00:04:31.796 --> 00:04:34.337]  That's why Trump and the military have been trying to make a deal
[00:04:35.097 --> 00:04:48.260]  As this heated up even during the election, with Russia to back us, if China has to be preemptively struck, it's the only way to stop a full-scale nuclear war, is to use all the space-based weapons and everything else.
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.461]  When their subs pop up, destroy it all in 10 minutes, or the entire planet will be destroyed.
[00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:58.762]  I'm not calling for nuclear war, but we've got to get ready to hit them with everything we've got.
[00:05:00.575 --> 00:05:01.556]  Tensions are high.
[00:05:01.556 --> 00:05:04.738]  Border wall contractors brace for a hostile environment.
[00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:11.923]  One potential bidder on President Donald Trump's border wall wanted to know if authorities would rush to help if workers came under hostile attack.
[00:05:11.923 --> 00:05:19.909]  Another asked if employees can carry firearms in states with strict gun control laws and if the government would indemnify them for using deadly force.
[00:05:20.109 --> 00:05:27.591]  With bids due Tuesday on the first design contracts, interesting companies are preparing for the worst if they get the potentially lucrative job.
[00:05:27.591 --> 00:05:27.972]  A U.S.
[00:05:27.972 --> 00:05:35.634]  official with knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity said four to ten bidders are expected to be chosen to build prototypes.
[00:05:35.854 --> 00:05:43.520]  They will be constructed on a roughly quarter mile 400 meter strip of federally owned land in San Diego within 120 feet of the border.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:54.328]  Though a final decision has not been made on the precise spot, Democrats vow to oppose any wall funding and many Republicans are also wary of this plan for a massive brick and mortar barrier.
[00:05:54.328 --> 00:05:58.992]  You can find more reports as we try to build the wall at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.521]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:06:02.521 --> 00:06:09.124]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:06:09.124 --> 00:06:12.285]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:06:12.285 --> 00:06:22.069]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:22.910]  Caveman.
[00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.972]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:06:27.972 --> 00:06:30.093]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:06:30.393 --> 00:06:33.535]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:06:33.535 --> 00:06:38.678]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:06:38.678 --> 00:06:46.823]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:54.767]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:06:54.767 --> 00:06:59.430]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself at InfoWarsLife.com today.

[00:08:03.446 --> 00:08:05.908]  So we have Eden right there.
[00:08:05.908 --> 00:08:06.549]  What's his name?
[00:08:24.714 --> 00:08:26.414]  There is a war.
[00:08:26.414 --> 00:08:28.235]  It's happening now.
[00:08:28.235 --> 00:08:30.656]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:08:30.656 --> 00:08:33.217]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:08:33.217 --> 00:08:35.138]  We are the resistance.
[00:08:35.138 --> 00:08:36.938]  We are the Infowar.
[00:08:36.938 --> 00:08:40.680]  I'm Alex Jones your host.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.400]  It is Wednesday.
[00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:47.790]  Hard to believe, already April 5th, 2017.
[00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:52.751]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:08:52.751 --> 00:08:59.372]  Bannon has been removed from the National Security Council, probably for yelling at the wrong person.
[00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:04.693]  There has been a lot of shouting matches and a lot of heated debates going on.
[00:09:04.693 --> 00:09:10.074]  And you can see the type of stress that's unfolding.
[00:09:10.074 --> 00:09:13.835]  We are in a very, very precarious position on a planetary scale.
[00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:23.699]  Because Communist China was backed by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1949 to be put into power.
[00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:30.843]  The CIA placed Mao into control and blocked the Nationalist Chiang Kai-shek.
[00:09:30.843 --> 00:09:38.987]  Then just a few years later, in 1950, the Korean War began, killing millions of people.
[00:09:43.302 --> 00:10:06.532]  The Chinese Communist-backed leader was the first of the family to be a dictator, and now his grandson, Kim Jong-un, the caricature of an evil, wimpy tyrant, grotesquely narcissistic and just insane with his bloodlust,
[00:10:07.796 --> 00:10:16.361]  His power trip squeezing his pathetic, sad, slave population.
[00:10:16.361 --> 00:10:18.202]  Wonder what the devil looks like, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:18.202 --> 00:10:19.403]  It is Kim Jong-un.
[00:10:19.403 --> 00:10:25.887]  I mean, he is the epitome of dishonor, of ugliness, of weakness, of failure.
[00:10:25.887 --> 00:10:29.929]  He is the parasite.
[00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:32.310]  He even looks like a tapeworm.
[00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.412]  Good God.
[00:10:34.412 --> 00:10:35.592]  But you look at his people.
[00:10:35.592 --> 00:10:36.273]  There's a photo.
[00:10:39.178 --> 00:10:43.421]  In a story on CNN, Rex Tillerson's incredibly odd and confusing statement on North Korea.
[00:10:43.421 --> 00:10:45.722]  No, it wasn't confusing at all.
[00:10:45.722 --> 00:10:51.626]  While you try to undermine our president and our government and the biggest crisis we've probably ever faced.
[00:10:51.626 --> 00:11:02.553]  And the photo shows Kim Jong-un with a tank crew or crews around him.
[00:11:02.553 --> 00:11:05.355]  And you look at the faces of these people.
[00:11:10.635 --> 00:11:14.217]  And they are just under total cultural mind control.
[00:11:14.217 --> 00:11:31.989]  If you want to talk about delusional mind control slaves, so starved to death that they don't even know what planet they're on.
[00:11:31.989 --> 00:11:33.170]  Now let me give you the big news here.
[00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.871]  It's so big I can hardly get it out of my mouth.
[00:11:38.868 --> 00:11:50.531]  Kim Jong-un was given nuclear reactors by ABB under the authorization of Bill and Hillary Clinton when they were both co-presidents in the 1990s.
[00:11:50.531 --> 00:11:56.033]  They allowed the transfer of the fissile material for the reactors that could be turned into atomic warheads.
[00:11:56.033 --> 00:11:57.553]  They did that.
[00:11:57.553 --> 00:12:04.535]  There were all sorts of different reactors that North Korea could have gotten that would not have been able to produce the fuel.
[00:12:04.535 --> 00:12:07.536]  And this goes back to Jimmy Carter as well and then right through to Bill Clinton.
[00:12:09.827 --> 00:12:35.145]  You've got the same suspects, the Rockefeller Foundation, all of them, busily, continually, pushing for North Korea to be given more and more and more and more weapon systems.
[00:12:35.145 --> 00:12:39.248]  We should get Joel Skousen on, who for a decade has been saying that around this time,
[00:12:41.385 --> 00:13:00.902]  At the earliest 2017, the latest 2022, that the globalists are intending to use North Korea as the trigger detonator to start World War III and to lure China and others into preemptive strikes against the United States.
[00:13:00.902 --> 00:13:03.024]  Now the word is Trump is aware of these plans.
[00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:08.324]  And is actually trying to work with Russia, Japan and others to not do this.
[00:13:08.324 --> 00:13:10.584]  But China is belligerent.
[00:13:10.584 --> 00:13:15.706]  They have been given a very strong position inside our economy, inside our government, inside the media.
[00:13:15.706 --> 00:13:20.527]  And you ally that with the hubris and mental illness of the Democrats.
[00:13:20.527 --> 00:13:21.987]  And you have a recipe for disaster.
[00:13:21.987 --> 00:13:24.568]  We have the EU piling on and attacking us.
[00:13:24.568 --> 00:13:25.708]  So here's the big headline.
[00:13:26.542 --> 00:13:28.744]  This is even out of CNBC.
[00:13:28.744 --> 00:13:36.010]  World War 3 nightmare scenario brewing in the East China Sea.
[00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.992]  That's yesterday.
[00:13:37.992 --> 00:13:39.993]  China is threatening to use nuclear weapons.
[00:13:39.993 --> 00:13:47.840]  They say if anyone blocks their ships, if anyone engages them, if anyone doesn't go along with what they want, they will attack.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.543]  That will then escalate very, very quickly from conventional weapons to nuclear weapons.
[00:13:52.551 --> 00:14:00.775]  You have to understand they've seized 90 plus percent of the South China Sea that's never been theirs.
[00:14:00.775 --> 00:14:09.040]  I understand they've brought down our AWACS before out of airspace and made to make emergency landings and then stolen all the equipment.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.020]  China is arrogant.
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:15.223]  They've killed 85 million, 84 million people under Mao, another 20 million or so since then.
[00:14:15.223 --> 00:14:16.904]  They keep Buddhists in cages.
[00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:23.695]  for no crimes and sell their organs, they're completely cut off from reality.
[00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:32.243]  They are being lured by the evil force that controls them into destroying the planet.
[00:14:32.243 --> 00:14:44.475]  And their surrogate, with the demonic chipmunk at its head, Kim Jong-un, when he's not partying with Dennis Rodman at the Pleasure Palace, he's
[00:14:46.098 --> 00:14:52.984]  Firing medium-range missiles targeting Japan and having them crash into the ocean.
[00:14:52.984 --> 00:15:01.891]  They fired more today ahead of the Chinese leader set to meet with Trump in the next few days.
[00:15:01.891 --> 00:15:02.812]  This is unprecedented.
[00:15:07.366 --> 00:15:12.490]  And you have to understand, in the mental illness of Kim Jong-un, he really believes he can defeat the United States.
[00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:14.751]  Well, he may defeat the planet, he may just kill everybody.
[00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:19.815]  Because again, our elites put them in power.
[00:15:19.815 --> 00:15:21.136]  In 1949, why?
[00:15:21.136 --> 00:15:22.036]  Why?
[00:15:22.036 --> 00:15:23.357]  Why?
[00:15:23.357 --> 00:15:24.738]  Gotta ask David Rockefeller that.
[00:15:24.738 --> 00:15:29.702]  He was intimately involved, his father, that whole stinking rat's nest of filth.
[00:15:30.643 --> 00:15:39.106]  That created the UN and pushed communism and wrote editorials in the New York Times how great communism was under Mao.
[00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:46.689]  You can just search engine, David Rockefeller's praise for Mao, New York Times, there's screenshots of it.
[00:15:46.689 --> 00:15:51.391]  This is the psychotic behavior of the Rockefellers and the globalists because they love death.
[00:15:51.391 --> 00:15:57.293]  They love the fact that the Chinese embraced eugenics and had a one-child policy killing over 100 million of their own people.
[00:15:57.293 --> 00:15:59.054]  They love the fact that China's on board.
[00:16:00.342 --> 00:16:04.403]  And is absolutely soulless at the top.
[00:16:04.403 --> 00:16:08.185]  They're kindred spirits.
[00:16:08.185 --> 00:16:17.027]  And after thousands of years feeding on the Chinese people, the Chinese elite are just the most despicable, wicked, soulless creatures the planet's ever seen.
[00:16:17.027 --> 00:16:27.951]  And then you have that demon, Kim Jong-un, rubbing his hands together, hopping around on power trips in front of his starving minions that worship him as a god.
[00:16:33.234 --> 00:16:38.258]  You look at the throngs of people in any video you see out of North Korea, and that's the best people they put forward.
[00:16:38.258 --> 00:16:41.941]  They look like sad schizophrenic folks on street corners.
[00:16:41.941 --> 00:16:46.264]  They are just whacked out of their mind.
[00:16:46.264 --> 00:16:47.985]  Totally enslaved.
[00:16:47.985 --> 00:16:51.668]  Being fed on by Kim Jong-un.
[00:16:51.668 --> 00:16:57.052]  The big tick that just sits up at the top, sucking their very life force out.
[00:16:57.052 --> 00:16:59.094]  And all of his generals in clown uniforms.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.941]  This is your big government.
[00:17:02.941 --> 00:17:04.002]  This is what you worship.
[00:17:04.002 --> 00:17:04.643]  Venezuela.
[00:17:04.643 --> 00:17:05.123]  Cuba.
[00:17:05.123 --> 00:17:05.684]  All of it.
[00:17:05.684 --> 00:17:07.665]  This is what it creates.
[00:17:07.665 --> 00:17:08.987]  Nazi Germany.
[00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:09.907]  Soviet Russia.
[00:17:09.907 --> 00:17:10.648]  Nightmares.
[00:17:10.648 --> 00:17:11.369]  Nightmares.
[00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:12.149]  Nightmares.
[00:17:12.149 --> 00:17:13.931]  Nightmares.
[00:17:13.931 --> 00:17:17.715]  Everyone worshiping one little fat man that can hardly walk.
[00:17:17.715 --> 00:17:20.958]  And who never did anything in his whole life.
[00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.140]  And so now, let's get to the big news.
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.643]  Rex Tillerson comes out, issues his final statement.
[00:17:27.557 --> 00:17:33.463]  That if they continue to launch these rockets at Japan or threaten to nuke Japan or South Korea, they're going to have to move.
[00:17:33.463 --> 00:17:35.986]  And our traitor media is like, how dare you, Trump!
[00:17:35.986 --> 00:17:50.521]  You should just keep laying down while they fire missiles and keep threatening to nuke everyone, and while China goes around belligerently boarding everybody's ships in the South China Sea, the most busy area in the world, saying, we rule, we control, we're in charge!
[00:17:52.478 --> 00:17:59.940]  And the Chinese government saying, we're prepared for nuclear war, we have submarines off your coast, we may strike you first.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.120]  And what's our elite doing?
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.200]  Trying to start a war with Russia.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.981]  It's doing nothing but trying to secure its borders.
[00:18:04.981 --> 00:18:09.842]  And as the very same George Soros, Rockefeller Foundation groups, openly trying to overthrow him.
[00:18:09.842 --> 00:18:20.445]  And now there's an article on InfoWars.com, exclusive with the documents, showing the latest chemical attack points right towards a George Soros funded group.
[00:18:20.445 --> 00:18:21.165]  You cannot
[00:18:23.109 --> 00:18:25.671]  Overestimate how evil these people are.
[00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:29.775]  And how they're backing Al-Qaeda and ISIS and Al-Nusra.
[00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:38.182]  So the world, according to every geopolitical expert out there, has never been closer to nuclear war.
[00:18:38.182 --> 00:18:46.390]  Because if they start loading atomic weapons on those missiles, and they've got the satellites that can tell the geospatial group,
[00:18:48.052 --> 00:18:49.293]  You have to take them out.
[00:18:49.293 --> 00:18:55.939]  You can't let them load nuclear weapons on missiles when a crazy person is running it saying we're gonna nuke the most populous cities in the world.
[00:18:55.939 --> 00:18:57.740]  You just can't do it.
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:11.932]  You can't let them load a gun and then now they're sticking to our heads saying we're gonna pull the trigger and we're like okay and then you watch our media literally being bought up by the Communist Chinese where Michael Savage couldn't even get his book on bookstore shelves because it talked about this four years ago.
[00:19:11.932 --> 00:19:13.133]  Total censorship everywhere.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.106]  Communist China, we're trying to run Google, Facebook, you name it.
[00:19:19.106 --> 00:19:20.648]  They're all in bed with each other.
[00:19:20.648 --> 00:19:23.572]  Facebook's in bed with Islamic States now.
[00:19:23.572 --> 00:19:27.136]  Pakistan to rat out people that criticize Islam so they can be executed.
[00:19:28.717 --> 00:19:31.818]  What do you think Zuckerberg would do to you if he could in this country?
[00:19:31.818 --> 00:19:34.759]  They're all a bunch of power-tripping lunatics.
[00:19:34.759 --> 00:19:38.280]  You look at Zuckerberg's eyes, he looks just like Kim Jong-un.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.542]  It's the same demon, folks, I'm telling you, of just total delusion.
[00:19:42.542 --> 00:19:44.242]  Ah, we're all powerful, ah, kill, blood.
[00:19:44.242 --> 00:19:46.543]  I mean, it's, it's, it's the most base crap.
[00:19:48.365 --> 00:19:51.469]  And now, Tillerson and everybody else are having to stand up against this.
[00:19:51.469 --> 00:19:59.140]  The President is, while the media attacks him, lies about him, undermines him, begging for nuclear war, emboldening China!
[00:20:00.956 --> 00:20:02.217]  Maybe not today.
[00:20:02.217 --> 00:20:03.498]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[00:20:03.498 --> 00:20:07.241]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[00:20:07.241 --> 00:20:08.322]  Forget bunkers.
[00:20:08.322 --> 00:20:10.143]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[00:20:10.143 --> 00:20:11.865]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[00:21:31.375 --> 00:21:36.157]  Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump.
[00:21:36.157 --> 00:21:40.238]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[00:21:40.238 --> 00:21:45.841]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.

[00:23:01.783 --> 00:23:06.828]  That one small company doesn't stand a chance against the corporate behemoths with all their money and lawyers.
[00:23:06.828 --> 00:23:08.850]  But they don't know Harry's.
[00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.171]  How's Harry's done it?
[00:23:10.171 --> 00:23:10.932]  Simple.
[00:23:10.932 --> 00:23:13.875]  By owning the factory and selling directly to you.
[00:23:13.875 --> 00:23:16.598]  Harry's sells their incredible razor blades online.
[00:23:16.598 --> 00:23:18.700]  They ship directly from their site to you.
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.801]  And do it for a lot less.

[00:24:02.754 --> 00:24:05.614]  Strange and dangerous days are here, my friends.
[00:24:05.614 --> 00:24:07.875]  Strange days have found us.
[00:24:07.875 --> 00:24:14.377]  They're going to destroy us if we don't wake up and take control of the ship of state from the globals.
[00:24:15.399 --> 00:24:19.517]  Yonkers, not the heir, the owner of Luxembourg because his...
[00:24:21.428 --> 00:24:40.822]  His grandfather during World War II took it over, the richest Nazi family, or the second richest family, has threatened military action against any states trying to leave the EU, and has threatened economic warfare against the UK, and has said he wants to break up the United States, and then Nigel Farage comes out and says, you're behaving like mafia gangsters.
[00:24:40.822 --> 00:24:45.285]  He's not some little gangster that, you know, does concrete scams.
[00:24:45.285 --> 00:24:48.227]  Juncker's family created Adolf Hitler.
[00:24:49.517 --> 00:25:00.659]  They were the second biggest armor producing war production family in Germany.
[00:25:00.659 --> 00:25:01.120]  Look them up!
[00:25:03.226 --> 00:25:07.831]  I'll just add that we have the EU telling us what to do, acting like belligerent scum.
[00:25:07.831 --> 00:25:11.394]  We've got the biggest mass murders in history, China threatening to nuke us today.
[00:25:11.394 --> 00:25:26.469]  We've got our media lined up attacking Trump and saying we've got to have war with Russia and wants NATO to invade all these countries and go toe-to-toe with the Russians on their borders and John McCain calling for physical war or saying you're Russian agents.
[00:25:26.469 --> 00:25:27.490]  This is insanity!
[00:25:29.372 --> 00:25:41.660]  If Russia was threatening to nuke the United States, if Russia had, you know, all of these threats going on and had some proxy state like North Korea threatening to attack our neighbors and allies and friends, I would be against Russia.
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.902]  Russia's not doing that.
[00:25:44.902 --> 00:25:47.563]  Does Russia own most of Hollywood now?
[00:25:47.563 --> 00:25:47.864]  No.
[00:25:47.864 --> 00:25:50.965]  People say, well, why are you backing Russia?
[00:25:50.965 --> 00:25:51.926]  Backing Russia?
[00:25:51.926 --> 00:25:53.207]  I've never been to Russia.
[00:25:53.207 --> 00:25:54.568]  I've geopolitically studied it.
[00:25:55.464 --> 00:25:57.045]  So is Trump's advisors.
[00:25:57.045 --> 00:26:01.808]  Russia is not in a posture to do anything but be economically developed.
[00:26:01.808 --> 00:26:09.493]  But the globalists don't want that rich country, so much times bigger than the United States, with all those resources, more than the continent of Africa.
[00:26:09.493 --> 00:26:17.519]  They do not want that to be explored by the Russian people or by other corporations and groups that want to go in there.
[00:26:19.443 --> 00:26:24.645]  You think the globalists can't compete with one America that's quasi-free because everybody else wants to be free?
[00:26:24.645 --> 00:26:29.628]  And everybody else wants to be able to have a good way of life?
[00:26:29.628 --> 00:26:31.489]  Imagine if Russia became the new America.
[00:26:31.489 --> 00:26:31.869]  It would.
[00:26:31.869 --> 00:26:33.710]  It'd be the Wild Wild West.
[00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:38.732]  It'd have 10-15% growth rates for a hundred years.
[00:26:38.732 --> 00:26:40.493]  Cities would spring up all across it.
[00:26:40.493 --> 00:26:44.014]  People would go flock to Russia.
[00:26:44.014 --> 00:26:45.075]  Call it the new America.
[00:26:46.567 --> 00:26:51.559]  It's the only big giant place that's 95% uninhabited, filled with resources.
[00:26:54.417 --> 00:27:08.884]  That's why the globalists are so angry, ladies and gentlemen, because Russia is the only country that hasn't fallen to globalist control, and now America's scurrying out of its tentacles, and now the UK's getting out of its tentacles, and now they're just freaking out, and what are they doing?
[00:27:08.884 --> 00:27:20.209]  The EU said, you accept our rule or we'll have war, and China is saying, we're pushing war because you're pulling out of globalism, and the, again, Chinese dictator, he's not the president,
[00:27:21.752 --> 00:27:28.875]  He was in Davos two months ago, he pulled the headlines up, saying he'll prop up globalism, he'll get Trump in line!
[00:27:28.875 --> 00:27:32.157]  And how are they doing that?
[00:27:32.157 --> 00:27:37.039]  They have North Korea as their excuse trigger.
[00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:41.761]  Firing missiles weekly into the ocean, right off the coast of Japan, threatening to nuke it.
[00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:47.104]  And now, you have Rex Tillerson, three weeks ago, saying weapons.
[00:27:48.103 --> 00:27:49.523]  Being used.
[00:27:49.523 --> 00:27:51.304]  Targeted strikes is now on the table.
[00:27:51.304 --> 00:27:58.365]  Now you've got top generals saying, maybe the only option left, four-star general Jack Keane.
[00:27:58.365 --> 00:28:02.466]  Well, if China is not going to solve North Korea, we will.
[00:28:02.466 --> 00:28:07.447]  This is all I am telling you, Trump told the Financial Times.
[00:28:07.447 --> 00:28:11.888]  And now you've got Tillerson with our own enemy media, CNN.
[00:28:11.888 --> 00:28:14.929]  More in bed with the Communist Chinese than anything else.
[00:28:16.041 --> 00:28:19.904]  Rex Tillerson's incredibly odd and confusing statement on North Korea.
[00:28:19.904 --> 00:28:22.666]  North Korea has fired a ballistic missile in the sea, but it doesn't matter.
[00:28:22.666 --> 00:28:24.087]  It's Rex Tillerson who's bad.
[00:28:24.087 --> 00:28:25.087]  Listen to this.
[00:28:25.087 --> 00:28:28.129]  North Korea launched yet another intermediate-range ballistic missile.
[00:28:28.129 --> 00:28:30.411]  The United States has spoken enough about North Korea.
[00:28:30.411 --> 00:28:31.472]  We have no further comment.
[00:28:32.244 --> 00:28:33.924]  They went, oh my god, what does that mean?
[00:28:33.924 --> 00:28:35.705]  He's so amateur, it makes no sense.
[00:28:35.705 --> 00:28:40.406]  Oh yeah, one of the top corporate guys ever, working in over 150 countries, totally respected.
[00:28:40.406 --> 00:28:41.787]  Works 18 hours a day.
[00:28:41.787 --> 00:28:44.347]  No, he's saying, we've already made our statement.
[00:28:44.347 --> 00:28:57.471]  If you don't stop doing it... Imagine if Russia had control of Cuba again, and was firing missiles every week, one mile off the coast of Florida, and missiles come and explode off the coast.
[00:28:57.471 --> 00:28:58.651]  They can carry nuclear weapons.
[00:29:00.506 --> 00:29:02.307]  We would be completely going crazy.
[00:29:02.307 --> 00:29:06.070]  What do you think the Japanese are doing?
[00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:11.453]  They're in a total emergency mode right now, mobilized for total war.
[00:29:11.453 --> 00:29:14.956]  Meanwhile, you turn on our media, it's demonized Trump, demonized Trump.
[00:29:14.956 --> 00:29:19.159]  You know, somebody's talking about Bannon being out right now, losing his national security clearance.
[00:29:20.748 --> 00:29:23.934]  Because, okay, that's important because he's a patriot.
[00:29:23.934 --> 00:29:25.917]  He's fighting for the Constitutional Bill of Rights.
[00:29:25.917 --> 00:29:28.602]  It shows the globalists are trying to push the patriots out right now.
[00:29:28.602 --> 00:29:33.049]  We don't know what happened yet, but we're now getting intel that Paul Ryan is who got him removed.
[00:29:34.758 --> 00:29:36.179]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:36.179 --> 00:29:38.802]  We're being attacked from every side.
[00:29:38.802 --> 00:29:42.305]  Not because we're perfect, but because we had a little bit of freedom.
[00:29:42.305 --> 00:29:46.669]  All the tyrants don't want that because then their people might learn about it.
[00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:50.192]  Like the poor North Koreans and might want to get out of the cults they're in.
[00:29:50.192 --> 00:29:53.715]  The government cults.
[00:29:53.715 --> 00:29:56.398]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.638 --> 00:30:07.202]  The United States is rapidly and dangerously moving towards a war with North Korea.
[00:30:07.202 --> 00:30:26.275]  Retired four-star General Jack Keane, who turned down President Donald Trump's offer to be Secretary of Defense, says a preemptive strike on North Korea's nuclear facilities might be the only option we have left to stop them from developing nuclear missiles capable of striking the U.S.
[00:30:26.275 --> 00:30:29.797]  White House National Security Advisor KT McFarland says,
[00:30:30.217 --> 00:30:40.364]  If it fails to put pressure on North Korea to disable its nuclear program, there is a real possibility that North Korea will be able to hit the U.S.
[00:30:40.364 --> 00:30:45.547]  with a nuclear-armed missile by the end of Trump's first term as president.
[00:30:45.547 --> 00:30:52.572]  Meanwhile, China has vowed to defend its territory at all costs if the U.S.
[00:30:52.572 --> 00:30:55.974]  launches a military attack against North Korea.
[00:30:55.974 --> 00:30:59.457]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:00.297 --> 00:31:01.117]  Hey, everyone!
[00:31:01.117 --> 00:31:03.418]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[00:31:03.418 --> 00:31:07.260]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.341]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:19.605]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[00:31:19.605 --> 00:31:25.587]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[00:31:26.067 --> 00:31:40.964]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[00:31:41.024 --> 00:31:41.605]  I think so.
[00:32:00.307 --> 00:32:02.148]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:32:02.148 --> 00:32:08.750]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:11.911]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:11.911 --> 00:32:21.695]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:32:21.695 --> 00:32:22.535]  Caveman.
[00:32:22.535 --> 00:32:27.597]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:32:27.597 --> 00:32:29.718]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:32:30.018 --> 00:32:33.159]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:32:33.159 --> 00:32:38.301]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:32:38.301 --> 00:32:46.444]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:32:46.444 --> 00:32:54.227]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:32:54.227 --> 00:32:57.908]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself.
[00:32:57.908 --> 00:32:59.049]  InfoWarsLive.com today.
[00:33:04.901 --> 00:33:07.002]  We are on the march.
[00:33:07.002 --> 00:33:11.143]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:11.143 --> 00:33:19.746]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:19.746 --> 00:33:21.207]  We don't want to gamble.
[00:33:22.222 --> 00:33:24.726]  The nuclear war with China and North Korea.
[00:33:24.726 --> 00:33:29.733]  We certainly don't want to gamble getting Russia on that side of the equation.
[00:33:29.733 --> 00:33:34.139]  But everything we see from the elites running our country is that they're sold out the Communist Chinese.
[00:33:34.139 --> 00:33:36.603]  We can see that, but we also know that from the research.
[00:33:38.499 --> 00:33:39.559]  Think about that.
[00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:41.760]  Think about that long and hard.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.660]  And then look at the traitors attacking Trump.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:58.563]  We're standing up to the North Koreans and China that are just grabbing islands all over the South China Sea, having wars with Vietnam, skirmishes, stealing their offshore oil rigs.
[00:33:58.563 --> 00:34:01.984]  I mean, China is just doing whatever it wants.
[00:34:01.984 --> 00:34:03.864]  Threatening to nuke Japan.
[00:34:05.512 --> 00:34:10.913]  Here's the headline, even CNBC, World War 3 nightmare scenario brewing in the East China Sea.
[00:34:10.913 --> 00:34:16.654]  And then Clay Dillow goes over in the special report, the major trigger for the war.
[00:34:16.654 --> 00:34:23.456]  Joel Skousen, former Marine Corps officer, really smart guy who's been predicting this will be the trigger for World War 3 for a decade.
[00:34:23.456 --> 00:34:32.498]  And he's been saying between 2017 and 2020 or 2022 that that would happen.
[00:34:32.498 --> 00:34:34.638]  Is Trump trying to change that trajectory?
[00:34:38.058 --> 00:34:38.999]  It's amazing.
[00:34:38.999 --> 00:34:43.663]  So we're going to be breaking all of this down here today.
[00:34:43.663 --> 00:34:50.689]  But Rex Tillerson and others have said military option is now moving to where it looks like it may be the only option.
[00:34:50.689 --> 00:34:52.530]  Donald Trump has said similar things.
[00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:54.252]  I've already gone over those quotes.
[00:34:54.252 --> 00:34:56.233]  But is the United States about to bomb North Korea?
[00:34:56.233 --> 00:34:59.676]  The White House says the clock has now run out.
[00:34:59.676 --> 00:35:02.879]  All options are on the table.
[00:35:02.879 --> 00:35:04.280]  They're making no further comment.
[00:35:07.017 --> 00:35:10.020]  Striking the facilities may be the only option left.
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.341]  Four-star General Jack Keane.
[00:35:11.341 --> 00:35:17.486]  It goes on and on.
[00:35:17.486 --> 00:35:19.348]  The clock has now run out.
[00:35:19.348 --> 00:35:27.715]  And I love trendies that haven't lived in a tyrannical country, that have lived in a lap of relative luxury compared to any other country in the world per capita.
[00:35:30.643 --> 00:35:34.288]  And they sit there and they go, we'll never be a nuclear war.
[00:35:34.288 --> 00:35:35.550]  That's never going to happen.
[00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:43.921]  And they make jokes about wanting to live under communism and they go and flip off communist victim memorials in DC and have celebrations about it.
[00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:46.545]  And they support radical Islam coming into our countries.
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:48.700]  Fools!
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:58.483]  But there are articles here that in Sweden and Belgium, the liberals are now running from the Islamic no-go zones, and they tried to be cuckold and grovel to them.
[00:35:58.483 --> 00:35:59.143]  It didn't work.
[00:35:59.143 --> 00:36:01.124]  So they're now suddenly waking up.
[00:36:01.124 --> 00:36:04.885]  But a little bit too late, right?
[00:36:04.885 --> 00:36:06.405]  A little bit too late for you now.
[00:36:06.405 --> 00:36:11.907]  You have to ask yourself, what is this madness, our elite,
[00:36:13.157 --> 00:36:22.302]  Creating the Arab Spring, overthrowing moderate Muslim countries, putting horrible oppressors in charge.
[00:36:22.302 --> 00:36:23.602]  What's happening?
[00:36:23.602 --> 00:36:26.964]  Read the article, Sweden Feminist Running Away From No-Go Zones.
[00:36:30.117 --> 00:36:35.078]  We've had prize money for liberal reporters to go to the no-go zones that we've been to and have been threatened and have been run out of.
[00:36:35.078 --> 00:36:37.779]  And they all go, I want the $10,000.
[00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:38.579]  They get there.
[00:36:38.579 --> 00:36:40.299]  They take the plane ticket from Watson.
[00:36:40.299 --> 00:36:42.360]  They get there and they go, oh, they almost killed me!
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.980]  Paul Watson's right!
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:47.201]  BBC reporters go, get beat up!
[00:36:47.201 --> 00:36:50.001]  BBC's, we're here to show it's safe and kiss your butt.
[00:36:50.001 --> 00:36:51.082]  They attack in seconds.
[00:36:51.082 --> 00:36:51.862]  Broad daylight.
[00:36:51.862 --> 00:36:52.442]  Police do nothing.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:01.805]  And it's all thug out, like little bitty skinny wimpy guys will just come up and start beating up like six foot five guys.
[00:37:01.805 --> 00:37:05.468]  And then the big guys will just lay there, ooh, I'm liberal, ooh, beat me up.
[00:37:07.039 --> 00:37:10.580]  That's why downtown Austin, they mug people that look like trendies.
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:15.982]  I've seen hundreds of surveillance camera tapes and they come out on the news and it's just, look, don't beat me up, why?
[00:37:15.982 --> 00:37:17.643]  I hate the fact I'm white.
[00:37:17.643 --> 00:37:20.464]  They'll punch around the nose.
[00:37:20.464 --> 00:37:23.024]  I mean, this is, this is what's happened.
[00:37:23.024 --> 00:37:27.586]  And now China and everybody else sees this and thinks the West is completely weak.
[00:37:27.586 --> 00:37:30.147]  Yes, the West has been committing suicide.
[00:37:30.147 --> 00:37:32.968]  And now the globalists, I guess, want a nuclear war.
[00:37:37.423 --> 00:37:48.546]  Chicago journalists sent a report on Swedish no-go zone after Trump's allegations that the country is dangerous are given a police escort and told to leave for their own safety as they attract mass thugs while filming in broad daylight.
[00:37:48.546 --> 00:37:52.587]  And the police won't do anything to the mass thugs!
[00:37:52.587 --> 00:38:02.390]  And I've watched these thugs, I mean, literally, if you know how to fight, you could kill three of them in about a minute and a half.
[00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:05.311]  I mean, I've been in fights with guys that absolutely put me, you know, in...
[00:38:07.239 --> 00:38:07.899]  We're good to go.
[00:38:26.476 --> 00:38:27.357]  Fifteen of them.
[00:38:27.357 --> 00:38:28.980]  I mean, they are just pathetic.
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.102]  Can't throw a punch.
[00:38:30.102 --> 00:38:31.183]  Stumble around.
[00:38:31.183 --> 00:38:33.868]  If they get a hit, they sit there and watch to see if you're gonna fall down.
[00:38:33.868 --> 00:38:36.632]  I mean, it's the craziest stuff you've ever seen.
[00:38:36.632 --> 00:38:37.994]  And everyone just rolls over.
[00:38:37.994 --> 00:38:39.116]  And that's a metaphor.
[00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:40.278]  That's a microcosm.
[00:38:43.394 --> 00:38:45.556]  For everything that's going on.
[00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:49.979]  It's like a Chihuahua up against the biggest, meanest, pet bully you've ever seen.
[00:38:49.979 --> 00:38:55.343]  And the Chihuahua's hanging off our lips, snarling and biting us, and we're just putting up with it.
[00:38:55.343 --> 00:38:58.785]  Except the Chihuahua's got nuclear weapons.
[00:38:58.785 --> 00:39:06.071]  And has gotten away with almost 70 years of mass murder and killing over 100 million of their own people.
[00:39:07.458 --> 00:39:10.323]  And now they're buying up everything, and so why not?
[00:39:10.323 --> 00:39:11.925]  Why not push America around?
[00:39:11.925 --> 00:39:19.657]  They look at Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters doddering ding-dongs, who don't even know what planet they're on, and see weakness.
[00:39:19.657 --> 00:39:20.999]  All they see is weakness.
[00:39:22.148 --> 00:39:24.390]  And they're pushing and pushing and pushing.
[00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:29.535]  And when they do that, it's Donald Trump's fault for saying, whoa, stop firing missiles at Japan.
[00:39:29.535 --> 00:39:30.616]  Stop boarding everybody's ships.
[00:39:30.616 --> 00:39:34.980]  Stop stealing our ships and our submarines and our water drones.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:38.123]  Stop coming into Philippine waters and just moving in.
[00:39:39.594 --> 00:39:45.438]  Notice that the new leader of the Philippines first was groveling to China just a few months ago when Trump showed strength.
[00:39:45.438 --> 00:39:46.759]  He said, good, I want to be with the U.S.
[00:39:46.759 --> 00:39:47.219]  again.
[00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:49.801]  But he thought, I guess, Hillary was getting in.
[00:39:49.801 --> 00:39:54.845]  The deal had been made to turn over most of Asia and the world to China.
[00:39:54.845 --> 00:40:01.790]  As soon as they figured out that America wasn't going to leave the Philippines, remember that got invaded by the Japanese and MacArthur said, I shall return?
[00:40:03.899 --> 00:40:06.300]  But as the public doesn't remember this, the Filipinos do.
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:10.763]  Because they lost, what, over 100,000 in World War II in the Philippines.
[00:40:10.763 --> 00:40:14.145]  They were put in slave camps, made to work for the Japanese.
[00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:16.646]  Oh, but I see, people don't know what already happened.
[00:40:16.646 --> 00:40:19.448]  They don't already know what took place in that area.
[00:40:19.448 --> 00:40:30.134]  And that China is spoiling to get back at Japan for the perceived abuses in World War II that certainly happened, even though it was Japan that was invaded over and over again by the Chinese.
[00:40:31.084 --> 00:40:35.327]  If you want to start tit-for-tatting, it's a nightmare scenario, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:35.327 --> 00:40:40.271]  And once the blood runs high in Asia, it's over.
[00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:44.775]  Because the Asians, historically, will go to war just like that.
[00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:45.215]  Just like that.
[00:40:45.215 --> 00:40:49.178]  Flip that switch.
[00:40:49.178 --> 00:40:58.466]  Three million men in one week came across out of China when the United States had pushed, and the UN force had pushed them all the way back to the river.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.722]  And that's what we're on the edge of right now.
[00:41:01.722 --> 00:41:03.384]  This won't be like fighting people in the Middle East.
[00:41:25.444 --> 00:41:28.387]  And that's what our government has put us in the position of.
[00:41:28.387 --> 00:41:36.875]  The Democrats, the globalists, giving them the nukes, giving them the missiles, giving them the cruise missiles, giving them the Laurel and Hughes.
[00:41:36.875 --> 00:41:46.165]  Pillar-to-post launch systems, the guidance systems, the avionics, the separation systems, the MIRV reentry devices, everything!
[00:41:49.181 --> 00:41:57.044]  And then now that they run Hollywood, every movie you go see about science and technology, it's like, thank God China gave the United States boosters, because our rockets don't work.
[00:41:57.044 --> 00:41:58.485]  It's all a big joke.
[00:41:58.485 --> 00:42:04.748]  And it'll actually show people playing the Chinese president going, I will save America, I'm their boss, with red flags behind them.
[00:42:04.748 --> 00:42:12.211]  I mean, we now in America have Chinese Central Committee propaganda on TV.
[00:42:20.526 --> 00:42:21.808]  So that's where we stand.
[00:42:21.808 --> 00:42:24.971]  That's where all this is going.
[00:42:24.971 --> 00:42:28.856]  And I guess that's just what Democrats and Liberals and everybody want.
[00:42:28.856 --> 00:42:29.737]  This is what you're into.
[00:42:29.737 --> 00:42:30.738]  You are sick!
[00:42:31.957 --> 00:42:33.397]  But see, most of you are just followers.
[00:42:33.397 --> 00:42:42.780]  You see the Soros bots and all the bots out there that ridicule this show when we talk about things and make jokes about nuclear war and jokes about pedophilia.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:48.021]  Everything's funny to these nihilistic bots and the people that load them with their comments.
[00:42:48.021 --> 00:42:57.883]  And then weak little minds sit there that have never lived in the real world and they sit there and they make jokes about this all day long, not knowing that we're on the precipice.
[00:42:57.883 --> 00:43:01.184]  With the whole world, the EU, dictatorship, the communist Chinese,
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:17.350]  The Democratic Party, the MSM, the Republican leadership, all ganged up on the small beachhead we have in our government of nationalism, insanity, and strength, and productivity.
[00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:32.081]  And just that little sliver of light coming through a crack in the blinds, a crack in the curtain, has lit the room up, and we see the economy turning back on, and all these good things happening, and we have all these enemies running around celebrating.
[00:43:34.929 --> 00:43:38.596]  What they believe is the beginning of the destruction of Trump.
[00:43:38.596 --> 00:43:40.720]  It's like people pouring gasoline on themselves.
[00:43:42.541 --> 00:43:43.101]  We're good to go.
[00:44:12.299 --> 00:44:16.400]  Since July 24th, 1953.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.561]  I'm going from memory on that.
[00:44:19.561 --> 00:44:21.361]  July 27th, 1953.
[00:44:21.361 --> 00:44:24.382]  And it was only a cease-fire on the Demilitarized Zone.
[00:44:24.382 --> 00:44:28.943]  The DMZ.
[00:44:28.943 --> 00:44:37.005]  And China, as a communist blackguard, is trying to take over the whole region.
[00:44:37.005 --> 00:44:37.585]  It's disgusting.
[00:44:39.793 --> 00:44:41.694]  Vietnam finally got smart and became capitalist.
[00:44:41.694 --> 00:44:45.695]  They're becoming wealthy beyond their wildest imaginations.
[00:44:45.695 --> 00:44:49.896]  That's all they've got to do.
[00:44:49.896 --> 00:44:52.117]  China's building new megacities.
[00:44:52.117 --> 00:44:56.839]  Bigger than Uruguay and more populous than Germany.
[00:44:56.839 --> 00:45:00.060]  Chinese leaders have bragged, oh, let us have a nuclear war.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.120]  We already have too many people anyways.
[00:45:03.885 --> 00:45:04.945]  All right, I'm going to continue.
[00:45:04.945 --> 00:45:08.987]  We're going to have Roger Stone popping in with news on Bannon losing power in the White House.
[00:45:08.987 --> 00:45:11.368]  ShakeUp, Infowars.com, RogerPort.com.
[00:45:11.368 --> 00:45:17.830]  We're going to be covering the summit in the next few days as Trump prepares to meet with the Chinese leader, the dictator.
[00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:29.634]  I remember 20 years ago when our news would talk about the Chinese dictator elected by the Central Committee.
[00:45:29.634 --> 00:45:30.734]  They don't do that now.
[00:45:30.734 --> 00:45:32.775]  They sit there and they lie directly to your face.
[00:45:37.569 --> 00:45:40.071]  I'm not saying nuclear war is going to happen.
[00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:51.502]  I'm saying the trigger has never been worse, and even mainline analysts concur with that, and admitting how much danger we're in, and admitting what we face, will help it not happen.
[00:45:51.502 --> 00:46:01.251]  But you see the ignorance, and the decadence, and the evil, and the pedophilia, and all the things that are happening in the West, and you just know that we're begging for it.
[00:46:05.646 --> 00:46:12.551]  Trump and Xi, two imposing leaders with clashing agendas.
[00:46:12.551 --> 00:46:13.371]  They're not leaders.
[00:46:13.371 --> 00:46:14.292]  Trump is elected.
[00:46:14.292 --> 00:46:17.474]  Xi is not.
[00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:28.521]  The Central Committee, made up of the grandchildren of the original communists and children, has the Politburo that it appoints that then has voting.
[00:46:28.521 --> 00:46:29.382]  I mean, what a joke!
[00:46:32.571 --> 00:46:42.236]  What an absolutely sickening, twisted, upside-down farce.
[00:46:42.236 --> 00:46:43.557]  Please support the broadcast.
[00:46:43.557 --> 00:46:51.481]  Survival Shield X2 is the only source, believe me, we're looking for other places to get it, of deep earth crystals.
[00:46:51.481 --> 00:46:58.525]  And we've had this for over four years because of a shortage of really good kelp-derived iodine that's good but not as good from our research.
[00:47:00.146 --> 00:47:04.948]  And so now we're having to sit there and squabble back and forth for more than six months trying to get more of it.
[00:47:04.948 --> 00:47:08.149]  So we've got our last run being produced right now.
[00:47:08.149 --> 00:47:15.472]  It's available at InfoWarsStorm.com.
[00:47:15.472 --> 00:47:25.276]  Again, that's SurvivalShieldX2 at InfoWarsLife.com, or you can call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:42.077]  And again, I hope to be able to continue to have this for myself personally, but we've run into things like not being able to get Shilajit that detoxifies you, so for six plus months we didn't have one of our detoxing products.
[00:47:42.077 --> 00:47:43.598]  It's just the way it goes.
[00:47:43.598 --> 00:47:47.681]  So, InfoWarsLife.com, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:47:47.681 --> 00:47:49.383]  888-253-3139.
[00:47:49.383 --> 00:47:52.185]  Caveman has been sold out for, what, a month or so.
[00:47:52.185 --> 00:47:54.667]  It's finally back at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:54.667 --> 00:47:56.469]  It's 33% off retail for a limited time.
[00:47:58.001 --> 00:48:00.102]  That is just the ultimate bone broth formula.
[00:48:00.102 --> 00:48:03.704]  I mean, it's so strong, so concentrated, tastes so good.
[00:48:03.704 --> 00:48:07.026]  Without the chocolate in it, it's only a little bit of chocolate, it doesn't taste very good.
[00:48:07.026 --> 00:48:10.007]  I like doing it with milk, then it tastes better than Ovaltine.
[00:48:10.007 --> 00:48:13.509]  You can even put it in with some ice and it's, you know, my kids love it.
[00:48:13.509 --> 00:48:16.651]  And they, you know, more and more, you know, we want more of those chocolate shakes.
[00:48:16.651 --> 00:48:21.153]  It tastes as good as a frosty chocolate shake in the blender, but I tend to just gulp it down.
[00:48:21.153 --> 00:48:22.994]  I think I'm gonna have some here in a little while.
[00:48:22.994 --> 00:48:24.755]  It's back in stock, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:48:27.307 --> 00:48:31.213]  It also has a bunch of other great antioxidants and things in it.
[00:48:31.213 --> 00:48:42.971]  I don't tell you how amazing folks know that bee pollen, chonga mushroom with turmeric root and so much more, the ultimate true paleo, five-star reviews.
[00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:48.111]  At Power Reviews and other major sites.
[00:48:48.111 --> 00:48:53.156]  I want to thank our listeners for their support and all they do is spreading the word about these great products.
[00:48:53.156 --> 00:48:54.417]  But I didn't list everything.
[00:48:54.417 --> 00:48:56.398]  It's ncaveman, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:48:56.398 --> 00:48:57.119]  Finally, a new announcement.
[00:48:57.119 --> 00:48:58.560]  We have some B-roll of this, I think.
[00:49:04.187 --> 00:49:07.290]  Donald J. Trump is the 45th president of the United States.
[00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:15.038]  You know, I was thinking Pence isn't perfect, he's okay, but I want a shirt I can wear that just says Trump is my president.
[00:49:15.038 --> 00:49:20.184]  A new one that's the navy blue design, looks like the Hillary for Prison shirt.
[00:49:20.184 --> 00:49:23.127]  Very handsome, very classy unisex shirt.
[00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:29.104]  On the back it says, Keeping America Great, Infowars.com in red.
[00:49:29.104 --> 00:49:30.785]  On the right shoulder, Infowars.com.
[00:49:30.785 --> 00:49:37.290]  On the front, 44th President of the United States, America, 1st since 1776.
[00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:38.891]  That's one version.
[00:49:38.891 --> 00:49:43.294]  The other on the front says, Trump is my President, America, 1st since 1776.
[00:49:43.294 --> 00:49:48.838]  So again, two different variants of the shirt available.
[00:49:50.669 --> 00:49:53.289]  At InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:49:53.289 --> 00:49:57.650]  And it's $9.95 out of the gates.
[00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:59.711]  Costs like a dollar more if it's an XXXL.
[00:49:59.711 --> 00:50:01.671]  Those cost us like $2 more.
[00:50:01.671 --> 00:50:03.171]  But again, thank you all for your support.
[00:50:03.171 --> 00:50:07.052]  It's important just to exercise free speech, regardless of what you think I'm from.
[00:50:07.052 --> 00:50:10.832]  To get out there and to let people know it's okay to stand up.
[00:50:10.832 --> 00:50:14.313]  And the $5 we make on the shirt ends up helping to fund the operation.
[00:50:14.313 --> 00:50:18.034]  But really, it's about InfoWarriors meeting each other.
[00:50:18.034 --> 00:50:19.854]  That's the biggest thing, is the people you're going to meet.
[00:50:21.235 --> 00:50:22.956]  Almost all of it's going to be positive.
[00:50:22.956 --> 00:50:26.219]  If you go into a trendy area, though, they might physically attack you.
[00:50:26.219 --> 00:50:29.621]  And they're totally wimpy, but they'll walk over, slap you in the back of the head, knock your drink over.
[00:50:29.621 --> 00:50:40.749]  Their main thing is to go, shame, shame, shame, boo, boo, like you're a two-year-old, and go, oh, you booed me, and you go to the corner and pee-pee in your pants.
[00:50:40.749 --> 00:50:44.932]  About three kids will do that to me and go, Alexis, Alexis, and I go, psh.
[00:50:44.932 --> 00:50:46.353]  My name's Alex, not Alexis, but OK, whatever.
[00:50:48.547 --> 00:50:55.793]  But I know adults that are under arrest of development out there, you know, somebody goes boo at you, you go, oh my gosh, let me go in the corner and pee-pee on myself.
[00:50:55.793 --> 00:50:57.554]  I have to wear the dunce hat now.
[00:50:57.554 --> 00:51:00.677]  We'll be right back with more of the acceleration towards global war.
[00:51:00.677 --> 00:51:05.981]  Being self-reliant is about being prepared and to do what you need to have your own source of renewable energy.

[00:51:30.439 --> 00:51:31.740]  It's called the Deep State.
[00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:36.524]  Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump.
[00:51:36.524 --> 00:51:40.607]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[00:51:40.607 --> 00:51:46.211]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.
[00:51:46.211 --> 00:51:50.534]  Newsmax, Lou Dobbs, Ann Coulter all say you must read Big Agenda.
[00:51:51.054 --> 00:52:01.321]  Think about this.
[00:52:01.321 --> 00:52:13.829]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:17.812]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[00:52:18.052 --> 00:52:21.854]  Protect your family's water supply with the trusted Big Berkey Water Filter.

[00:54:28.524 --> 00:54:32.729]  Kim Jong-un is trying to start a nuclear war, threatening to nuke Japan and South Korea.
[00:54:32.729 --> 00:54:34.851]  Trump is saying, look, we can't keep letting you do this.
[00:54:34.851 --> 00:54:37.915]  We're going to have to strike your sights and keep doing it.
[00:54:37.915 --> 00:54:45.363]  And so now the liberal media is attacking Trump like it's his fault when it was the Clintons that gave the missile secrets and the nuke secrets publicly.
[00:54:46.246 --> 00:54:49.028]  That's mainstream news to North Korea.
[00:54:49.028 --> 00:54:55.112]  Here's the headline, Bloomberg, Bannon loses National Security Council role in Trump shakeup.
[00:54:55.112 --> 00:55:03.097]  But then I read this, a White House official said that Bannon was placed on the committee in part to monitor Trump's first National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, and never attended a meeting.
[00:55:03.097 --> 00:55:07.660]  He is no longer needed with McMaster in charge of the council, that official said.
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:10.002]  So are we kind of panicking inadvertently?
[00:55:10.002 --> 00:55:12.524]  Is he really not losing power?
[00:55:12.524 --> 00:55:15.045]  The Constituent Insider, Roger Stone joins us.
[00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:16.166]  Roger, what's really going on?
[00:55:17.327 --> 00:55:30.014]  Well, Alex, as we reported yesterday here on Infowars.com, there are still internal turf battles and power struggles, sadly, in the Trump White House.
[00:55:30.014 --> 00:55:40.481]  One of the things I learned under Ronald Reagan and before him, President Nixon, was that a White House divided against itself, like a campaign divided itself,
[00:55:41.041 --> 00:55:45.104]  Cannot stand that everyone has to be pulling in the same direction.
[00:55:45.104 --> 00:55:49.268]  And in this case, that has to be the president's direction.
[00:55:49.268 --> 00:56:08.204]  I reported correctly yesterday that Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and also a policy advisor, a special assistant to the president, I believe, in this administration, has been feeding by text Joe Scarborough, one of the leading Trump critics in the media,
[00:56:08.724 --> 00:56:19.212]  A derogatory information at the expense of Mr. Bannon and other White House tidbits that play into the internal struggles.
[00:56:19.212 --> 00:56:28.779]  Some media outlets claimed that I told you yesterday that Kushner was leaking intelligence information to Scarborough.
[00:56:28.779 --> 00:56:32.802]  That's not what we said, nor what we discussed.
[00:56:32.802 --> 00:56:37.646]  But I do think that this is at least a loss of public status.
[00:56:38.246 --> 00:56:39.527]  For Steve Bannon.
[00:56:39.527 --> 00:57:06.123]  And the reason this concerns me, Alex, is because, as you know, Google and Facebook and the other Internet giants are moving aggressively to choke off alternative viewpoints to the mainstream media, declaring InfoWars, Breitbart, Daily Caller, StoneColdTruth.com, where you can read all of my stuff, as fake news.
[00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:21.763]  If there's anyone inside the Trump White House who should understand this issue and understand the anti-trust issues that are triggered by Google's activities, it is Steve Bannon.
[00:57:22.364 --> 00:57:26.267]  A man who came from alternative media.
[00:57:26.267 --> 00:57:33.111]  And therefore, any loss of power or influence is a bad sign for the future of the net.
[00:57:33.111 --> 00:57:37.554]  Well, let me just say, I like what he did at the New York newspaper that he owns.
[00:57:37.554 --> 00:57:40.636]  The New York Observer did some pretty good reporting over the years.
[00:57:40.916 --> 00:57:42.797]  I don't want to be enemies with Kushner.
[00:57:42.797 --> 00:57:48.440]  If he delivers on being a patriot, he could probably be president, I think, down the road is kind of what this dynasty building is doing.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.661]  If it isn't going to be Trump's daughter, it's going to be Gil Kushner.
[00:57:50.661 --> 00:57:53.302]  I mean, clearly that's what they're setting him up for.
[00:57:53.302 --> 00:57:57.824]  But I just don't understand being involved with that weasel, you know, Joe Scarborough.
[00:57:57.824 --> 00:58:00.025]  And now the media is making jokes everywhere.
[00:58:00.025 --> 00:58:01.906]  Oh, we think he's Illuminati.
[00:58:01.906 --> 00:58:03.547]  Oh, we think he's leaking intelligence.
[00:58:03.547 --> 00:58:04.687]  We didn't say that.
[00:58:04.687 --> 00:58:06.488]  We just said he's talking to Scarborough.
[00:58:06.488 --> 00:58:07.488]  We have our moles.
[00:58:07.488 --> 00:58:08.449]  They don't even deny this.
[00:58:08.869 --> 00:58:13.470]  By text, a constant text back and forth between them.
[00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:17.911]  Look, I have nothing, obviously, against Jared Kushner.
[00:58:17.911 --> 00:58:27.053]  He's a very bright and very able guy, but he's a liberal Democrat and he brings the point of view of a liberal Democrat.
[00:58:27.053 --> 00:58:30.894]  I'm not sure he understands the Trump coalition.
[00:58:30.894 --> 00:58:34.875]  I'm not sure he understands the InfoWar watcher.
[00:58:34.875 --> 00:58:35.815]  Absolutely, stay there.
[00:58:35.815 --> 00:58:37.996]  We are the backbone of the Trump revolution.
[00:58:38.596 --> 00:58:42.863]  Back in 70 Seconds with Roger Stone, I'm Alex Jones and we've got a bunch of other big guests today.
[00:58:42.863 --> 00:58:46.549]  The man that predicted all this Korea stuff is also going to be joining us.
[00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.910]  Stay with us.
[00:58:50.874 --> 00:58:55.617]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.
[00:58:55.617 --> 00:59:00.040]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:10.667]  InfoWars Life has set out to bring you formulations that are not only the highest quality out there, but formulas that you can use on a daily basis to give your body the natural herbs and extracts that our experts recommend.
[00:59:11.267 --> 00:59:19.233]  The Prostagard formula does just that, with its mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants that help give your body total support.
[00:59:19.233 --> 00:59:28.600]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3, selenium, and copper.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:38.847]  Prostagard is something that the men on the InfoWars crew take every day, and from our research, it's something that men should really be adding to their daily regimen in order to keep their body going at optimal levels.
[00:59:39.347 --> 00:59:41.029]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:11.620]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.522]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.522 --> 01:00:25.551]  The poets tell how Poncho fell and left his living in a cheap hotel.
[01:00:25.551 --> 01:00:33.037]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold, so the story ends we're told.
[01:00:33.037 --> 01:00:33.818]  Poncho needs you
[01:00:36.286 --> 01:00:42.331]  Roger Stone is our guest for one more segment, and then we've got a bunch of other guests on every major issue you can imagine.
[01:00:42.331 --> 01:00:49.858]  But I fear for my family's safety legitimately, at a gut level, an intellectual level, over this North Korea situation.
[01:00:49.858 --> 01:00:54.041]  And so I want to just shift gears briefly with Roger Stone, who knows President Trump very, very well.
[01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:59.305]  I've talked to a lot of folks in the military and intelligence who've told me something about Trump that months later you see in the news.
[01:00:59.305 --> 01:01:04.070]  Reagan says gloves are off, green light, first day, told the military, all these al-Qaeda groups, hit them.
[01:01:05.191 --> 01:01:09.473]  I talk to folks that were there in these meetings and then you see it later come out in the news months later.
[01:01:09.473 --> 01:01:12.134]  I mean, so Trump is a real man of action.
[01:01:12.134 --> 01:01:22.558]  So I'm almost, I know we can't capitulate to China and others, but at the same time I get really concerned that they realize that Trump's not playing around and his generals aren't playing around.
[01:01:22.558 --> 01:01:28.141]  So knowing Trump, what would you, what's your message to the communist dictator and to North Korea?
[01:01:29.161 --> 01:01:31.644]  You know, Alex, I think you're absolutely right.
[01:01:31.644 --> 01:01:36.509]  In this sense, Donald Trump reminds me very much of Ronald Reagan.
[01:01:36.509 --> 01:01:39.252]  You know, he has a genial manner.
[01:01:39.252 --> 01:01:40.914]  He can speak to anyone.
[01:01:40.914 --> 01:01:44.077]  But underneath all of that is raw steel.
[01:01:44.938 --> 01:01:48.121]  He is the toughest individual I have ever met.
[01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:51.824]  I've seen him at the negotiation table.
[01:01:51.824 --> 01:02:00.171]  I've had the unfortunate experience of negotiating compensation deals with him over the years when I have worked for him.
[01:02:00.171 --> 01:02:03.674]  And he's a very, very tough and resolute guy.
[01:02:03.674 --> 01:02:05.275]  He's extremely stubborn.
[01:02:06.016 --> 01:02:08.617]  When he sets his mind on a goal.
[01:02:08.617 --> 01:02:19.341]  This is not the marshmallow that Barack Obama was who draws lines in the sand and then watches our enemies cross them and does nothing.
[01:02:19.341 --> 01:02:25.964]  This is not, you know, Bill Clinton, who could have taken out the
[01:02:27.724 --> 01:02:30.868]  Osama Bin Laden, and did not.
[01:02:30.868 --> 01:02:32.730]  He's a very resolute guy.
[01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:39.337]  I think the North Koreans may have bit off a bit more than they can chew.
[01:02:39.337 --> 01:02:40.278]  What do you make of this?
[01:02:40.278 --> 01:02:44.362]  I mean, clearly, what do you think is going to happen in the next few days when he meets with the Chinese dictator?
[01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:53.140]  Well, I think he purposely upped the rhetoric going into the meeting to start on offense.
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:03:02.687]  At the same time, I think the head of the Chinese government will find the president to be polite and genial, but he's not going to budge.
[01:03:02.687 --> 01:03:04.809]  He has had a long-held view.
[01:03:05.629 --> 01:03:16.974]  That the Chinese are taking advantage of us in a thousand ways, whether it is the hacking and pirating of our technology, or whether it is these one-sided trade deals.
[01:03:16.974 --> 01:03:20.356]  He wants to have a better relation with the Chinese.
[01:03:20.356 --> 01:03:26.799]  He understands that this is an enormous nation with millions and millions of people.
[01:03:26.799 --> 01:03:30.821]  But the days of the United States being a patsy are over.
[01:03:31.958 --> 01:03:34.442]  And Donald Trump I think is about to prove that.
[01:03:34.442 --> 01:03:36.805]  We've got a minute and a half left.
[01:03:36.805 --> 01:03:38.869]  Other political tidbits you'd like to relay to folks?
[01:03:39.488 --> 01:03:46.153]  Well, Alex, I'm going to join you, as you know, later today at two your time hosting the fourth hour.
[01:03:46.153 --> 01:03:50.336]  And we're going to delve deeper into the Scarborough question.
[01:03:50.336 --> 01:03:55.119]  We're going to lay out exactly how we learned what we learned without names.
[01:03:55.119 --> 01:03:58.621]  But we're also going to talk about what's going on in the White House.
[01:03:58.621 --> 01:04:04.285]  And we're going to focus on the Google threat to our future freedom.
[01:04:04.285 --> 01:04:06.727]  This is coming down hard and fast.
[01:04:06.727 --> 01:04:08.869]  I know you're experiencing it at InfoWars.
[01:04:09.409 --> 01:04:12.590]  We're experiencing it at StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:13.871]  Congress must respond.
[01:04:13.871 --> 01:04:17.412]  I mean, their political base is being strangled, much less the First Amendment.
[01:04:17.412 --> 01:04:20.973]  Congress must act or be... This is insane!
[01:04:20.973 --> 01:04:26.836]  Or the Justice Department, who I think have a very clear antitrust or tortious interference.
[01:04:26.836 --> 01:04:27.596]  Absolutely.
[01:04:27.596 --> 01:04:28.476]  I've talked to my lawyers.
[01:04:28.476 --> 01:04:29.657]  It's the very definition of it.
[01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:33.978]  And then they have David Brock and everyone admitting their meeting with Google and everybody to censor us.
[01:04:33.978 --> 01:04:35.299]  I mean, it's just all out in the open.
[01:04:36.059 --> 01:04:47.304]  Well, you were the first to point out to me Barack Obama's Ministry of Truth, which I presume is prodding all of these internet companies to declare things fake news.
[01:04:47.304 --> 01:04:51.346]  So this is actually a government-directed shutdown.
[01:04:51.346 --> 01:04:53.027]  And it's a stay-behind network, Deep State.
[01:04:53.027 --> 01:04:57.509]  He created this Deep State Department in one of his last bills he signed on December 6th.
[01:04:57.509 --> 01:04:58.189]  And then here we are.
[01:04:58.189 --> 01:04:58.749]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:04:58.749 --> 01:05:00.070]  We'll see you in the hour four.
[01:05:00.550 --> 01:05:01.510]  Tensions are high.
[01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:04.692]  Border wall contractors brace for a hostile environment.
[01:05:04.692 --> 01:05:11.874]  One potential bidder on President Donald Trump's border wall wanted to know if authorities would rush to help if workers came under hostile attack.
[01:05:11.874 --> 01:05:19.857]  Another asked if employees can carry firearms in states with strict gun control laws and if the government would indemnify them for using deadly force.
[01:05:20.077 --> 01:05:27.568]  With bids due Tuesday on the first design contracts, interesting companies are preparing for the worst if they get the potentially lucrative job.
[01:05:27.568 --> 01:05:27.948]  A U.S.
[01:05:27.948 --> 01:05:35.639]  official with knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity said four to ten bidders are expected to be chosen to build prototypes.
[01:05:35.819 --> 01:05:43.465]  They will be constructed on a roughly quarter-mile, 400-meter strip of federally owned land in San Diego within 120 feet of the border.
[01:05:43.465 --> 01:05:54.294]  Though a final decision has not been made on the precise spot, Democrats vow to oppose any wall funding, and many Republicans are also wary of this plan for a massive brick and mortar barrier.
[01:05:54.294 --> 01:05:58.958]  You can find more reports as we try to build the wall at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:01.024 --> 01:06:02.585]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:06:02.585 --> 01:06:07.507]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[01:06:07.507 --> 01:06:11.029]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:16.852]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[01:06:16.852 --> 01:06:22.555]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[01:06:22.975 --> 01:06:25.936]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[01:06:25.936 --> 01:06:31.499]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[01:06:31.499 --> 01:06:38.523]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[01:06:38.523 --> 01:06:43.085]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[01:06:43.365 --> 01:06:46.649]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[01:06:46.649 --> 01:06:48.751]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:06:48.751 --> 01:06:54.477]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:56.900]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.602]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[01:07:01.257 --> 01:07:06.741]  The reason InfoWarsLife has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[01:07:06.741 --> 01:07:07.581]  I take this.
[01:07:07.581 --> 01:07:08.722]  My family takes this.
[01:07:08.722 --> 01:07:13.005]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere.
[01:07:13.005 --> 01:07:17.468]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:17.608 --> 01:07:22.251]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[01:07:22.251 --> 01:07:23.372]  I don't feel good.
[01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:27.135]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[01:07:27.135 --> 01:07:29.817]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[01:07:29.817 --> 01:07:35.621]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[01:07:35.621 --> 01:07:38.583]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[01:07:38.583 --> 01:07:42.125]  And I know my hair's a little luxurious once again.
[01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:44.367]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[01:07:44.367 --> 01:07:44.707]  I love it.
[01:07:44.867 --> 01:07:47.669]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[01:07:47.669 --> 01:07:48.690]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:54.335]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[01:07:54.335 --> 01:07:56.517]  It's got a five-star rating.
[01:07:56.517 --> 01:07:58.719]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[01:08:12.412 --> 01:08:17.955]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[01:08:17.955 --> 01:08:20.617]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:37.164]  Geopolitical intelligence expert, the editor of the World Affairs Brief, will be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:37.164 --> 01:08:38.725]  That's Joel Skousen.
[01:08:38.725 --> 01:08:48.033]  He's been saying North Korea will be the trigger for a globalist manipulated world war, starting somewhere around 2017 to 2022 at the latest.
[01:08:48.033 --> 01:08:53.837]  He's been saying that for, I said a decade, he's been saying it for 15 years.
[01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:57.960]  And of course he was a Marine Corps officer and a lot of other things.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:08:58.821]  He knows his stuff.
[01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:00.763]  I'm
[01:09:17.119 --> 01:09:27.444]  I don't think the globalists want war right now, and Trump's trying to stop globalism, so that course is getting changed some, but that's what could then trigger this in my expert view, and I do research this in great detail.
[01:09:27.444 --> 01:09:33.246]  Let me tell you something, anybody making jokes about this is out of their mind.
[01:09:33.246 --> 01:09:38.809]  And I always notice the most uninformed, softest people think nuclear war is a joke because it hasn't happened yet.
[01:09:40.043 --> 01:09:52.048]  If it ever happens, folks, the only way to have it survivable would be to pre-target and pre-strike China.
[01:09:52.048 --> 01:09:59.731]  And even if one submarine didn't get taken out, ten missiles into the west coast, east coast, I mean, you just can't.
[01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:02.925]  It's unbelievable.
[01:10:02.925 --> 01:10:09.086]  And you now see the Secretary of State, the General saying, only option could be striking North Korea because they say we're going to load atomics on.
[01:10:09.086 --> 01:10:10.887]  We'll nuke Japan any moment.
[01:10:10.887 --> 01:10:12.047]  We'll nuke Korea.
[01:10:12.047 --> 01:10:13.707]  South Korea.
[01:10:13.707 --> 01:10:18.328]  Meanwhile, Maxine Waters thinks that Putin invaded Korea.
[01:10:18.328 --> 01:10:20.489]  That's who we have running things.
[01:10:20.489 --> 01:10:21.209]  Yep, there it is.
[01:10:21.209 --> 01:10:21.309]  U.S.
[01:10:21.309 --> 01:10:27.250]  may have no choice but to launch preemptive strike on Kim Jong-un's nuclear facility, says four-star General who's close to Trump.
[01:10:27.250 --> 01:10:27.950]  It goes on and on.
[01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:29.731]  They say the clock has run out.
[01:10:29.731 --> 01:10:30.911]  Let's go to Doug Hagman.
[01:10:31.937 --> 01:10:32.137]  of course
[01:10:51.678 --> 01:10:59.523]  Months before it came out in the news about Wiener being looked at for child porn and the rest of it, everything got diverted off into the whole pizza deal.
[01:10:59.523 --> 01:11:10.269]  But I wanted to get him on for an update on this, but also just what other chatter he's hearing, the open calls that we are now seeing from the media.
[01:11:12.017 --> 01:11:16.220]  That they want an overthrow of Trump using COG.
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:19.862]  We know the Communist Chinese are openly lobbying for that, and that Davos Bragner doing it.
[01:11:19.862 --> 01:11:24.285]  So the world is precariously in a giant Mexican standoff right now.
[01:11:24.285 --> 01:11:30.750]  Everybody's got guns pointed at each other, and jokers threatening military action in Europe if countries pull out.
[01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:32.651]  That's the unelected head of the EU.
[01:11:32.651 --> 01:11:35.013]  But it's like, oh, he's the president of the EU Council.
[01:11:35.013 --> 01:11:36.494]  He's a dictator.
[01:11:36.494 --> 01:11:37.995]  His family took over Luxembourg.
[01:11:37.995 --> 01:11:39.296]  He owns Luxembourg.
[01:11:40.538 --> 01:11:42.760]  Because the Nazis took it and his grandpa gave it to him.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.424]  I mean, you can't make that up.
[01:11:46.424 --> 01:11:48.286]  So, Doug Hagman, thank you for joining us.
[01:11:48.286 --> 01:11:53.191]  We've got our investigators out on the West Coast getting a lot of intel from law enforcement on the pedophile rings.
[01:11:53.191 --> 01:11:54.312]  More arrests all the time.
[01:11:54.312 --> 01:12:00.418]  They caught a big ring reportedly shipping underage Chinese girls around in California just two days ago.
[01:12:00.418 --> 01:12:01.299]  So many reports coming out.
[01:12:01.299 --> 01:12:02.180]  I can't keep track of them.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:03.281]  So, Doug, where do you want to start?
[01:12:04.434 --> 01:12:07.758]  Well, I think that's a great place to start, Alex.
[01:12:07.758 --> 01:12:16.407]  I've been watching you, keeping track on your coverage of this, and I think that we're seeing the consequence of some low-level
[01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:42.658]  Targeting of the the pedophile network that was uncovered through the Document grab by the task force NYPD FBI task force under the Red Run election time so I think I think we're seeing the the results of that right now and no one's really happy at the moment that this is going so slow and it seems to be going painfully slow and I agree and
[01:12:43.258 --> 01:12:48.981]  Why don't they just go after the big fish and let's get things rolling here?
[01:12:48.981 --> 01:12:55.124]  Certainly would love to see some some high-level people in the prison orange being perp-walked in front of the cameras.
[01:12:55.124 --> 01:12:58.906]  And I think that's one question that we have to ask is why isn't that taking place right now?
[01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:28.589]  But I think there are multiple levels of this, Alex, and one aspect that we're covering that I had mentioned some time ago is the, if I can divert just briefly to this, the four IT staffers, well three IT staffers specifically, the Awan brothers, and I know that you've covered some of this, the Awan brothers were escorted out of the Capitol, supposedly back
[01:13:29.324 --> 01:13:48.972]  In December, there were up to 20 office break-ins, capital office break-ins, by, perhaps by, or allegedly by the, at the hands of the three O'Wan brothers, O'Wan brothers that were, have been working for congressional staffers, or congresspeople, I'm sorry.
[01:13:48.972 --> 01:13:51.313]  So could this be a plumber type operation?
[01:13:52.304 --> 01:13:55.927]  Well, actually, worse than that.
[01:13:55.927 --> 01:14:01.631]  This is Islamic infiltration at the highest levels of our Congress.
[01:14:01.631 --> 01:14:09.016]  And George Webb, an independent citizen journalist, has been doing a great job of uncovering this on YouTube.
[01:14:09.016 --> 01:14:20.445]  But the long and short of it is, very simply, back in 2005, Congressman Gregory Meeks had hired Imran Awan to do his IT work.
[01:14:21.585 --> 01:14:32.408]  As things progressed, Imran Awan's two other brothers came to work for a total of 31 congressmen and women between 2005 and 2017.
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:56.817]  It was on January, on or about January 2nd of this year, where all three of the Wan brothers were escorted from the Capitol grounds because of an alleged procurement scam with respect to computer equipment at the Capitol building.
[01:14:56.817 --> 01:15:00.661]  But just to really cut this right to the quick here right now,
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:24.432]  It has investigation and the results of our investigation, Mr. Webb's investigation, has proven or shown that the Iwan brothers, Pakistani nationals, and their wives, two wives of the three brothers, so a total of five people, were getting paid as IT consultants for 31 Congress men and women since 2005 through the 2nd of January of 2017.
[01:15:24.432 --> 01:15:25.492]  But they were, they actually
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:34.962]  And I'm saying this now, I'm fully saying this.
[01:15:34.962 --> 01:15:58.598]  They hacked into the computers of the 31 congressmen and women, of which a good percentage of them were on three of the highest level committees, including the Homeland Security Committee, the... So to boil this down, one of the biggest scandals five years ago was the CIA caught spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[01:15:59.318 --> 01:16:05.281]  Okay, but now we've just got Islamist groups doing it, and notice it's citizen journalists that first broke this.
[01:16:05.281 --> 01:16:09.663]  I'm glad the Daily Caller says exclusive, but the point is it's citizen journalists doing the ferreting.
[01:16:09.663 --> 01:16:12.244]  I'm just giving credit to the people out there to know how important they are.
[01:16:12.244 --> 01:16:23.430]  It's kind of like Mr. Cernovich broke the info on Susan Rice, gets credit nowhere, and it's one of the biggest stories in the country now confirmed.
[01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:25.231]  Wall Street Journal has more people
[01:16:26.135 --> 01:16:26.675]  Well yeah, exactly.
[01:16:26.675 --> 01:16:31.477]  And what we're seeing here is we're putting these, connecting these dots, or these layers of criminality coming from within.
[01:16:31.477 --> 01:16:32.897]  So we've got domestic enemies
[01:16:47.623 --> 01:16:56.448]  Infiltrating and infiltrated are all levels of government, including the executive branch, the judiciary, as well as the legislative branch.
[01:16:56.448 --> 01:17:15.639]  So as we watch, for example, the news break about Susan Rice saying, I didn't do nothing to nobody or whatever her comment was, that there's some integration between that and the cover up of the Owan Brothers, as well as there is integration between that and the DOD spending.
[01:17:15.639 --> 01:17:16.620]  And I'm connecting a lot of
[01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:19.801]  Pretty far apart dots here.
[01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:33.918]  That and the defense spending, which is going to kind of pale in comparison to what's breaking on a geopolitical level worldwide with respect to the situation of North Korea, China and the United States.
[01:17:34.178 --> 01:17:34.618]  That's right.
[01:17:34.618 --> 01:17:37.120]  Trump's coming out saying Susan Rice may have committed a crime.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:37.600]  No.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.761]  Rand Paul's right.
[01:17:38.761 --> 01:17:41.062]  She committed a big crime.
[01:17:41.062 --> 01:17:43.543]  A big crime, unmasking for political purposes.
[01:17:43.543 --> 01:17:45.284]  It's total felony.
[01:17:45.284 --> 01:17:47.546]  It's absolute dirty pool.
[01:17:47.546 --> 01:17:50.807]  Nixon did one micron of this and was gone, and should have been.
[01:17:50.807 --> 01:17:52.768]  So what needs to happen?
[01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:53.449]  Bigger picture here.
[01:17:54.784 --> 01:18:10.356]  Well, yeah, because of the complexity of this, and people have a tendency to want things broken down into Twitter-bite, Tourette's Syndrome-style reports, but the bottom line here is that this is all interconnected.
[01:18:10.356 --> 01:18:13.599]  We're totally compromised, and the Russians and Trump aren't the threat.
[01:18:14.119 --> 01:18:17.863]  Trump's the answer, and they've had a year of this going on.
[01:18:17.863 --> 01:18:19.084]  There's nothing there.
[01:18:19.084 --> 01:18:23.848]  They admit there's nothing, but they keep trying to recycle it, but it's clearly losing steam right now.
[01:18:23.848 --> 01:18:25.369]  Where do you think this is going?
[01:18:25.369 --> 01:18:29.493]  Well, and a lot of this is to cover up Hillary Clinton's connections with the Russians.
[01:18:29.493 --> 01:18:37.320]  I mean, of all people and of all parties, it's the Clintons, the Clinton Foundation, and the Democratic National Committee that has
[01:18:38.829 --> 01:18:42.432]  That has the relationship with the Kremlin or with Russia.
[01:18:42.432 --> 01:18:45.114]  That's why Podesta and the WikiLeaks cooked up the Russian thing.
[01:18:45.114 --> 01:18:49.016]  He says, push Russia, push Russia, because he knew he was being investigated.
[01:18:49.016 --> 01:18:50.277]  Right, exactly.
[01:18:50.277 --> 01:18:55.281]  So this is so upside down and backwards, and it takes a lot of time to really untangle this.
[01:18:55.281 --> 01:19:00.245]  Well, it's like in the old cop movies, you know, that are based on true stories, where you catch the guy and he goes, no, he did it!
[01:19:00.245 --> 01:19:03.367]  You know, it's like they point the finger at the guy that doesn't even have the bag of money in his hand.
[01:19:04.268 --> 01:19:05.108]  Exactly.
[01:19:05.108 --> 01:19:12.850]  Yeah, and right, it's almost like musical chairs with felony charges, potentially felony charges.
[01:19:12.850 --> 01:19:25.492]  But when you look at Clinton, for example, Skolkovo Foundation, her relationship with the Skolkovo Foundation, which is Russia-backed, you look at all of these connections.
[01:19:25.492 --> 01:19:26.912]  It's not Donald Trump.
[01:19:26.912 --> 01:19:28.492]  It's not the Republicans.
[01:19:28.492 --> 01:19:30.653]  It's not the new administration.
[01:19:30.653 --> 01:19:32.613]  The Republicans have never been in bed with the Russians.
[01:19:32.613 --> 01:19:33.233]  That's well known.
[01:19:33.948 --> 01:19:34.948]  Right, exactly.
[01:19:34.948 --> 01:19:44.050]  And the Russians are under, well, I shouldn't say the Russians, the communist doctrine is the undergirding of the globalist intent, the agenda.
[01:19:44.050 --> 01:19:59.494]  So, the big picture, from a view from space, is when you look at this, it is the globalists who are attempting to instill... With Islam, with Juncker, the EU, with the Chinese, all ganged up on us, America's in a fight for its life, and Japan and England are coming to our aid.
[01:20:00.285 --> 01:20:01.386]  Think about this.
[01:20:01.386 --> 01:20:13.876]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[01:20:13.876 --> 01:20:18.139]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[01:24:12.946 --> 01:24:15.586]  Trump's having a press conference right now with the King of Jordan.
[01:24:15.586 --> 01:24:17.287]  He just got asked about Steve Bannon.
[01:24:17.287 --> 01:24:19.087]  We're gonna play that clip when we start the next segment.
[01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:22.168]  We've only got six more minutes right now with Doug Hagman.

[01:24:35.943 --> 01:24:38.025]  To the informed, they go, wow, this guy's done his research.
[01:24:38.025 --> 01:24:40.507]  Well, so's Doug Hagman, so's people like Joel Skousen.
[01:24:40.507 --> 01:24:43.851]  I get the best brains with the best long-term analysis on.
[01:24:43.851 --> 01:24:51.158]  And everyone concurs that the biggest threat to peace and life on this planet is the North Korean peninsula, the South China Sea.
[01:24:51.158 --> 01:24:52.680]  We heard that from him 15 years ago.
[01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:53.981]  Joel Skousen, come up in the next segment.
[01:24:56.570 --> 01:25:00.371]  There are globalist forces that think they can survive a nuclear war.
[01:25:00.371 --> 01:25:03.872]  They have given weapons to North Korea and China to be a threat.
[01:25:03.872 --> 01:25:04.993]  It's insane!
[01:25:04.993 --> 01:25:06.213]  It's evil!
[01:25:06.213 --> 01:25:07.453]  Like pedophilia or any of this.
[01:25:07.453 --> 01:25:08.254]  What is going on?
[01:25:08.254 --> 01:25:11.335]  You've got these authoritarian brainwashed regimes.
[01:25:11.335 --> 01:25:12.635]  It's just, it's out of control.
[01:25:12.635 --> 01:25:21.198]  So what's Trump supposed to do when they say we're going to load atomics on a missile and shoot it at Japan for no reason and they're firing missiles weekly almost hitting Japan?
[01:25:22.662 --> 01:25:30.440]  So Doug Hagman, your analysis of that and just the waterfront general analysis of your federal sources of what they think of Trump at this point.
[01:25:31.345 --> 01:25:38.632]  Yeah, I have to say this, Alex, I would defer anything in that realm to Joel Skousen.
[01:25:38.632 --> 01:25:50.503]  He's got the contacts, he's got the experience, and I certainly would defer to him his expertise because, again, he knows much more about that aspect of things than I could ever hope to.
[01:25:50.503 --> 01:25:55.488]  Sure, but just in general, as you were saying, you look at the battlefront worldwide, the globalist forces, we're in a war right now.
[01:25:56.168 --> 01:25:58.129]  Exactly, and that's part of it.
[01:25:58.129 --> 01:26:24.023]  And when I look at my side of things, on the domestic side, what I'm hearing from my FBI sources, one confirmation I got from both an FBI source as well as an agency source or CIA source, saying watch the role of the National Geospatial Agency, the NGA, as well as the NSA in the upcoming days with respect to the leaks that had come out about the Trump administration, but also
[01:26:24.723 --> 01:26:47.713]  Yeah Information that has yet to come out that will be dropped here within the next couple of weeks There's more to come with respect to the allegations of not not Donald Trump and the Russians but the other members of previous regime Obama Jarrett in particular Valerie Jarrett with respect to Iran ran Russia and
[01:26:48.434 --> 01:26:51.077]  There's more to come with respect to this integration.
[01:26:51.077 --> 01:26:56.223]  That's right, they got admittedly penetrated and bought off by Russia and that's why they're freaking out so much right now.
[01:26:56.977 --> 01:26:57.718]  Exactly.
[01:26:57.718 --> 01:27:05.402]  So this, I would expect the next 72 hours to be critical in terms of the information that will be coming out.
[01:27:05.402 --> 01:27:09.925]  And I'm going to be very interested to see, Alex, I'm wondering what your thoughts are.
[01:27:09.925 --> 01:27:18.410]  Will we see Susan Rice testify under oath in front of a Senate committee or will it just be... She should be hauled in front of it and she should be indicted immediately.
[01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:19.590]  She clearly committed crimes.
[01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:21.652]  They lied to the public and said they didn't do this.
[01:27:22.432 --> 01:27:23.973]  I mean, arrest them all.
[01:27:23.973 --> 01:27:24.694]  Exactly.
[01:27:24.694 --> 01:27:28.617]  Yeah, I'm just, you know, what I'm hearing is... We're about to have nuclear war, folks.
[01:27:28.617 --> 01:27:30.258]  It's time to arrest Hillary Clinton.
[01:27:30.258 --> 01:27:32.100]  We've got to save the country.
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:33.821]  The world's never been in more danger.
[01:27:33.821 --> 01:27:35.503]  They're the ones that made everything radical.
[01:27:35.503 --> 01:27:39.986]  Kim Jong-un, Hillary, all these other scumbags, Juncker, all of them need to be arrested.
[01:27:39.986 --> 01:27:41.227]  They're all calling for war.
[01:27:41.227 --> 01:27:42.788]  They're all involved in criminal activity.
[01:27:42.788 --> 01:27:43.729]  Arrest all of them.
[01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:44.190]  I'm serious.
[01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:47.232]  Yeah, no, 100% behind you.
[01:27:47.232 --> 01:27:51.396]  And I think that while Americans don't have... We can't wait!
[01:27:51.396 --> 01:27:52.797]  The world is in too much danger!
[01:27:52.797 --> 01:27:55.460]  We have to stop these people, and I've never talked like this in 20 years.
[01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:58.162]  Folks, we have to, these people all must be rounded up.
[01:27:58.162 --> 01:27:58.503]  I'm sorry.
[01:27:59.468 --> 01:28:05.230]  No, they must, because they brought us to this point, and they have sold us out.
[01:28:05.230 --> 01:28:09.452]  The Korean situation, fueled by Iran.
[01:28:09.452 --> 01:28:12.813]  Iran, of course, fueled by... They gave them much of it, too.
[01:28:12.813 --> 01:28:15.294]  The Clintons gave them the reactors and all the rest of it.
[01:28:15.885 --> 01:28:17.087]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:17.087 --> 01:28:26.318]  So we've got this melting pot, or this really sewage pot of strife worldwide.
[01:28:26.318 --> 01:28:29.342]  We got to this point because of Obama, and right now...
[01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:31.711]  And Clinton, especially.
[01:28:31.711 --> 01:28:45.377]  And by the way, Hillary Clinton played a significant role under Madeleine Albright during the Clinton presidency as the shadow Secretary of State to bring us to this point as well, and then moving on as Secretary of State under Obama.
[01:28:45.377 --> 01:28:51.460]  So, this has her fingerprints all over the place, and here we are, you know, at this level.
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:57.983]  So, there's much more to get into, but watch the next really 72 to 96 hours with respect to the taps.
[01:28:58.243 --> 01:29:07.290]  Why would our, in just one minute, why would our elite, even though they're evil, why would they want to not have Russia on our side during this China crisis?
[01:29:07.290 --> 01:29:08.892]  Why are they trying to bring Russia down?
[01:29:10.066 --> 01:29:11.327]  Well, it's chaos.
[01:29:11.327 --> 01:29:13.148]  Operation Chaos, basically.
[01:29:13.148 --> 01:29:20.312]  This is a... Hey, the same playbook that we used, or that the Globals used back in the 60s, is being used today.
[01:29:20.312 --> 01:29:22.453]  And it's everybody against everybody.
[01:29:22.453 --> 01:29:28.196]  Let's destroy, let's burn the whole damn thing down and, you know, start it from scratch.
[01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:36.121]  It's very imprudent to do that, obviously, but these people that we're dealing with, as you pointed out, they're psychos.
[01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:37.362]  HagmanReport.com.
[01:29:37.362 --> 01:29:38.402]  HagmanReport.com.
[01:29:38.402 --> 01:29:39.923]  Doug, if you can pop back Friday, that'd be great.
[01:29:39.923 --> 01:29:41.084]  God bless you.
[01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:41.664]  Thank you.
[01:29:41.664 --> 01:29:45.386]  Joel Skousen, straight ahead, and I'm going to recap some of the big breaking news.
[01:29:45.386 --> 01:29:48.408]  We've got that Trump question on Bannon and more straight ahead.
[01:29:48.408 --> 01:29:50.089]  Infowars.com is being censored.
[01:29:50.089 --> 01:29:51.510]  Spread that link.
[01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.910]  Infowars.com.
[01:30:00.555 --> 01:30:07.099]  The United States is rapidly and dangerously moving towards a war with North Korea.
[01:30:07.099 --> 01:30:26.172]  Retired four-star General Jack Keane, who turned down President Donald Trump's offer to be Secretary of Defense, says a preemptive strike on North Korea's nuclear facilities might be the only option we have left to stop them from developing nuclear missiles capable of striking the U.S.
[01:30:26.172 --> 01:30:29.714]  White House National Security Advisor KT McFarland says,
[01:30:30.114 --> 01:30:40.281]  If it fails to put pressure on North Korea to disable its nuclear program, there is a real possibility that North Korea will be able to hit the U.S.
[01:30:40.281 --> 01:30:45.464]  with a nuclear-armed missile by the end of Trump's first term as president.
[01:30:45.464 --> 01:30:52.489]  Meanwhile, China has vowed to defend its territory at all costs if the U.S.
[01:30:52.489 --> 01:30:55.891]  launches a military attack against North Korea.
[01:30:55.891 --> 01:30:59.374]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:31:00.254 --> 01:31:02.157]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:31:02.157 --> 01:31:04.179]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:31:04.179 --> 01:31:06.982]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:31:06.982 --> 01:31:13.169]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:31:13.169 --> 01:31:20.518]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[01:31:20.658 --> 01:31:22.319]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:31:22.319 --> 01:31:27.422]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[01:31:27.422 --> 01:31:29.863]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:31:29.863 --> 01:31:37.888]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:31:37.888 --> 01:31:38.869]  The general public doesn't.
[01:31:40.078 --> 01:31:44.019]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:31:44.019 --> 01:31:47.580]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:54.302]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:31:54.302 --> 01:31:58.423]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[01:32:00.635 --> 01:32:08.120]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:21.329]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:34.166]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:32:34.166 --> 01:32:40.133]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[01:33:02.848 --> 01:33:05.510]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:14.978]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:14.978 --> 01:33:25.628]  Well, Joe Skousen, more than anybody, has been breaking down the Korean Peninsula, South China Sea trigger for at least 15 years, and I can remember probably long.
[01:33:25.628 --> 01:33:26.769]  But I've been interviewing Skousen for
[01:33:28.547 --> 01:33:29.868]  19 years or something?
[01:33:29.868 --> 01:33:36.191]  We're gonna go to the editor there at World Affairs Brief here in just a moment.
[01:33:36.191 --> 01:33:42.934]  If people haven't gotten storable foods, if folks don't have supplies, now more than ever is the time to have it.
[01:33:42.934 --> 01:33:49.197]  And we sell high quality ones produced right here in America by the folks that are the best at it at the very lowest prices at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:33:51.201 --> 01:33:58.286]  Also, it's great to stock up on the true iodine or nascent iodine that we have that I take all the time.
[01:33:58.286 --> 01:34:00.068]  It's amazing.
[01:34:00.068 --> 01:34:01.028]  From Infowarslive.com.
[01:34:02.932 --> 01:34:11.794]  We are having trouble getting more after having it for four plus years, getting more from the deep gas wells that they drill when they find it at 7 to 12,000 feet.
[01:34:11.794 --> 01:34:13.535]  So this couldn't be in the last round of that.
[01:34:13.535 --> 01:34:18.956]  Like we couldn't get this really clean kelp anymore and we're in crisis about five years ago and then discovered this.
[01:34:18.956 --> 01:34:21.136]  But you got to go through the DEA and have licenses.
[01:34:21.136 --> 01:34:22.817]  This is the real stuff.
[01:34:22.817 --> 01:34:24.337]  I mean, not the particular bottle.
[01:34:24.337 --> 01:34:30.779]  It's put in a gaseous form and then it's super high quality, but it's not pure iodine from the crystals that'll eat a hole through the floor.
[01:34:30.779 --> 01:34:31.239]  I mean, it's like,
[01:34:33.192 --> 01:34:34.133]  A pure element.
[01:34:34.133 --> 01:34:37.497]  And if you go into all the science of it, the point is it's the good halogen.
[01:34:37.497 --> 01:34:44.445]  If you want that, it's regular retail price right now at InfoWarsStore.com and is about to sell out.
[01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:49.150]  Then we have enough to do a couple more runs and that's it.
[01:34:49.150 --> 01:34:51.633]  And then on top of that, we also have 25% off.

[01:35:07.475 --> 01:35:10.676]  All orders $50 or more free shipping.
[01:35:10.676 --> 01:35:17.859]  Your support now is more needed than ever because we're facing massive censorship on the internet.
[01:35:17.859 --> 01:35:18.439]  Everybody is.
[01:35:18.439 --> 01:35:20.319]  It's trying to promote freedom.
[01:35:20.319 --> 01:35:21.240]  We are facing
[01:35:22.506 --> 01:35:26.567]  The globalists fighting back on every front and we hope to fix all this peacefully.
[01:35:26.567 --> 01:35:28.268]  But clearly you can see where the world's going.
[01:35:28.268 --> 01:35:35.390]  You can see how they're trying to undermine nationalists like Trump and nationalists like the new British Prime Minister.
[01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:43.012]  You can really see old crazy Nazi heirs like Juncker coming out on the unelected dictatorship and threatening everybody.
[01:35:43.012 --> 01:35:46.933]  You can see all the other military threats and economic threats.
[01:35:46.933 --> 01:35:50.134]  Globalism is in crisis and I believe Trump's for real.
[01:35:51.226 --> 01:35:54.567]  And he doesn't want to take us on the course to World War 3 down the road that the Globals were planning.
[01:35:54.567 --> 01:35:58.709]  So he's trying to get off that course, but I don't think they are going to let him do that.
[01:35:58.709 --> 01:36:02.370]  And it may trigger it, him trying to stop it now, being strong with North Korea.
[01:36:02.370 --> 01:36:04.611]  And Skousen's broke this down from so many angles.
[01:36:04.611 --> 01:36:07.051]  We're going to go to him again in a second.
[01:36:07.051 --> 01:36:10.273]  It's critical that you subscribe to his newsletter and his news briefs.
[01:36:10.273 --> 01:36:12.713]  It's critical you support InfoWars and buy our products.
[01:36:12.713 --> 01:36:15.034]  And I know most of you know more than I do.
[01:36:15.034 --> 01:36:16.475]  The point is, get the newsletters.
[01:36:16.475 --> 01:36:19.116]  Get the magazines that are produced by the New American.
[01:36:19.116 --> 01:36:19.896]  Hand them out to people.
[01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:22.291]  Get our films.
[01:36:22.291 --> 01:36:25.212]  Get his book and film, Strategic Relocation.
[01:36:25.212 --> 01:36:26.453]  They go together.
[01:36:26.453 --> 01:36:27.894]  I produced a little documentary.
[01:36:27.894 --> 01:36:29.835]  We've got a new one coming out soon with his work.
[01:36:29.835 --> 01:36:30.975]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:30.975 --> 01:36:32.656]  You can read the 55 reviews of the book, 4.8.
[01:36:38.868 --> 01:36:39.488]  4.9 on the film.
[01:36:39.488 --> 01:36:41.089]  That is just unprecedented.
[01:36:41.089 --> 01:36:45.290]  4.9 on the reviews from Power Reviews about that.
[01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:51.051]  That's one of the most respected review outfits out there, but you can see other reviews elsewhere as well.
[01:36:51.051 --> 01:36:54.832]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:54.832 --> 01:36:59.113]  And listen, it's back there in Anthony's office, but he's visiting family right now.
[01:36:59.113 --> 01:37:00.473]  I forgot to get it this morning.
[01:37:00.473 --> 01:37:02.274]  We had an FTC complaint in New York.
[01:37:03.396 --> 01:37:12.041]  Not against us, but against Powell Reviews, one of the biggest third-party sites, one of the most respected, saying, these are fake reviews, there's no way he's got 3,000 reviews for X2, it's 4.9.
[01:37:12.041 --> 01:37:12.441]  There's no way.
[01:37:12.441 --> 01:37:14.883]  This is one of the most respected sites.
[01:37:14.883 --> 01:37:23.768]  So they sent a big letter back, you know, the person about the complaint, just saying, we're not going to be bullied into, you know, into sitting there and saying that our reviews aren't real.
[01:37:23.768 --> 01:37:25.569]  These are real people.
[01:37:25.569 --> 01:37:29.472]  In fact, if anything, they go in and cut out reviews that are too positive that make claims.
[01:37:30.782 --> 01:37:31.703]  Again, we're being hit.
[01:37:31.703 --> 01:37:33.404]  They're trying to stop us getting our iodine.
[01:37:33.404 --> 01:37:36.066]  They're kicking us off our advertising on Google.
[01:37:36.066 --> 01:37:39.869]  They're on the news with David Brock saying, shut me down.
[01:37:39.869 --> 01:37:41.831]  They've gone to Congress.
[01:37:41.831 --> 01:37:43.312]  And then it's happening.
[01:37:43.312 --> 01:37:43.832]  It's happening.
[01:37:43.832 --> 01:37:46.034]  This is how they strangle our republic.
[01:37:46.034 --> 01:37:49.576]  And then the Washington Post has the nerve to have the headline.
[01:37:49.576 --> 01:37:51.298]  Democracy dies in the dark.
[01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:53.520]  The New York Times says the truth lives here.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:56.322]  That's our old slogan that Beckton took.
[01:37:56.322 --> 01:37:57.082]  Or the truth's alive.
[01:37:57.082 --> 01:37:57.743]  It's at Infowars.
[01:37:59.696 --> 01:38:01.858]  It's crazy, and I'm not even that good, folks.
[01:38:01.858 --> 01:38:05.001]  It's just that we're putting up a defense with Americana.
[01:38:05.001 --> 01:38:05.762]  We didn't invent it.
[01:38:05.762 --> 01:38:11.007]  We're trying to resurrect it, and they are absolutely freaking out right now.
[01:38:11.007 --> 01:38:13.190]  If you just go to the Washington Post, it's their masthead.
[01:38:13.190 --> 01:38:16.473]  You can see it on their website underneath the term Washington Post.
[01:38:16.473 --> 01:38:21.097]  So, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139, and whatever you do,
[01:38:24.653 --> 01:38:31.382]  Get our articles, get our videos, get the material, and send it out via email and personally to everyone you know.
[01:38:31.382 --> 01:38:35.247]  Human power can crush the bots, the algorithms, and Google.
[01:38:35.247 --> 01:38:37.090]  They got defeated in the election.
[01:38:37.090 --> 01:38:38.332]  They're getting defeated everywhere.
[01:38:39.650 --> 01:38:40.811]  They're getting defeated in France.
[01:38:40.811 --> 01:38:42.171]  They're getting defeated all over.
[01:38:42.171 --> 01:38:42.932]  They're in panic mode.
[01:38:42.932 --> 01:38:53.837]  So you're now seeing their full force and threats of war with old, weird Nazi fossils, you know, that hijacked Luxembourg crawling out of the Sir line like, you know, the clown It threatening everyone.
[01:38:53.837 --> 01:38:56.138]  So this is a mega important time to be alive.
[01:38:56.138 --> 01:39:01.901]  We'll find out what Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief has to say right now about the statements.
[01:39:01.901 --> 01:39:03.221]  We may have nuclear war.
[01:39:03.221 --> 01:39:04.902]  We may have to strike these targets.
[01:39:04.902 --> 01:39:06.543]  All of this with him right now, Joel.
[01:39:08.405 --> 01:39:09.746]  Alex, it's good to be with you.
[01:39:09.746 --> 01:39:29.433]  As you know, I've been predicting that North Korea will be the trigger event for World War III, and it's one of the reasons why Russian China tolerated a young crazy man, Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un, the current leader, because it's very, very convenient to have a war start with a crazy man, so that even Russian China can say, hey, we don't control this guy, it's not our fault.
[01:39:30.492 --> 01:39:41.784]  But I've always said that, you know, Russian China controlling North Korea may postpone that war into the next decade because Russian China's military isn't ready yet.
[01:39:41.784 --> 01:39:46.328]  This Friday I'm about to issue a new brief in the World Affairs Brief changing that prediction.
[01:39:47.577 --> 01:39:56.643]  Just because the rhetoric is heating up so much about preemptively stopping North Korea that it could trigger World War III earlier.
[01:39:56.643 --> 01:40:01.546]  In fact, I'm worried that they may want to blame this for on Trump.
[01:40:02.648 --> 01:40:10.512]  Instead of having a normal globalist in there, they may want to have this as the ultimate takedown to taint his reputation forever if this war starts.
[01:40:10.512 --> 01:40:14.514]  Now, in fact, it's KT McFarland who's a rabid neocon, and so is H.R.
[01:40:14.514 --> 01:40:16.855]  McMaster running the National Security Council.
[01:40:16.855 --> 01:40:25.000]  By the way, they just demanded that Steve Bannon be taken off that council because they didn't want someone loyal to Trump hearing their deliberations.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.245]  After they got rid of Flynn, who wasn't an insider, you know, they put H.R.
[01:40:30.245 --> 01:40:31.386]  McMaster in there and K.T.
[01:40:31.386 --> 01:40:38.853]  McFarland, and this is a very much an insider neocon outfit that's going to drive us toward war.
[01:40:38.853 --> 01:40:41.015]  I don't believe McFarland's statement.
[01:40:41.015 --> 01:40:48.182]  This is part of the old mantra of saying we're going to get North Korea to step down from a nuclear program.
[01:40:48.182 --> 01:40:49.743]  We've done that three times before.
[01:40:50.546 --> 01:40:51.507]  And we've had a treaty.
[01:40:51.507 --> 01:41:00.112]  Every time they've backed out of it, they've denied international inspectors and cheated on the treaty, but we keep fulfilling our part of it.
[01:41:00.112 --> 01:41:08.717]  I use that as my basic rationale for saying there's got to be a reason why they treat Iran with such hostility, who doesn't even have a nuclear weapon yet.
[01:41:09.853 --> 01:41:12.094]  And Iran they treat with kid gloves.
[01:41:12.094 --> 01:41:15.836]  They say no military option on the table, no regime change required.
[01:41:15.836 --> 01:41:22.140]  And they do these treaties, Iran cheats or North Korea cheats, and they still follow through with oil deliveries.
[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:25.061]  They still follow through with money and releasing sanctions.
[01:41:25.061 --> 01:41:28.964]  If they do this all over again, that means that they're still on the same track.
[01:41:29.904 --> 01:41:44.972]  I've written in my brief that the one thing that Trump could do that wouldn't appear to trigger the war that could stop North Korea is to simply use our ageist naval missile systems to shoot down any ICBM tests that North Korea launches over international waters.
[01:41:44.972 --> 01:41:46.332]  It's legal.
[01:41:46.332 --> 01:41:47.573]  They're headed towards Japan.
[01:41:47.573 --> 01:41:48.614]  That's a threat to Japan.
[01:41:48.614 --> 01:41:49.754]  They can shoot them down.
[01:41:49.754 --> 01:41:52.175]  And that would stop North Korea from delivering.
[01:41:52.175 --> 01:41:52.856]  Now, of course,
[01:41:53.576 --> 01:42:02.320]  North Korea may take rash action and trigger the event, but I don't think they'd do so without permission from Russia and China.
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:13.685]  But for the first time, Alex, I'm worried that my timetable may be accelerated because of Trump being in office, because he could be the one to take preemptive action, and it could start World War III.
[01:42:13.685 --> 01:42:16.887]  So people really need to increase their preparedness.
[01:42:17.407 --> 01:42:20.049]  ZGPing and the Communist Chinese.
[01:42:20.049 --> 01:42:27.694]  Let's talk about what drives them, their alliances with the old globalist order, that deal that seems to be kind of breaking up a little bit, how Russia plays into this.
[01:42:27.694 --> 01:42:33.158]  But first, Joel, I've never, you know, interviewed you in 19 years, heard you be this dire.
[01:42:33.158 --> 01:42:38.082]  I mean, we're seeing, you know, talk of, well, the only thing on the table may be, you know, hitting their sides.
[01:42:38.082 --> 01:42:39.443]  You know, the clock has run out.
[01:42:39.443 --> 01:42:40.303]  The statement by
[01:42:41.344 --> 01:42:46.030]  Uh, the Secretary of State today saying, we've already made our statement, no further statement, no more talk.
[01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:48.714]  I mean, that just sounds like action is about to happen.
[01:42:48.714 --> 01:42:57.946]  Uh, and so I guess we're going to have some real brinksmanship coming up in two days when the communist Chinese dictator, uh, comes to, uh, uh, I guess, uh, visit, uh, President Trump.
[01:42:59.935 --> 01:43:06.778]  Well, you know, in my theory, there are three globalist centers of power competing for one another.
[01:43:06.778 --> 01:43:11.880]  There's the Anglo-American globalists that we deal with in the West and NATO, the Atlantic Alliance, etc.
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:18.862]  Then there's Russia and China who want to establish their own independent global New World Order with them in control.
[01:43:18.862 --> 01:43:23.324]  They intend to fight each other eventually, but they're in a temporary alliance to take down the West.
[01:43:23.624 --> 01:43:25.986]  And that's what World War III is all about.
[01:43:25.986 --> 01:43:30.069]  That's why they're preparing massive weapons of mass destruction.
[01:43:30.069 --> 01:43:33.992]  But both Russia and China play up to the current globalists.
[01:43:33.992 --> 01:43:38.176]  You know, they invite Rothschild, they invite Kissinger, and then they have talks.
[01:43:38.176 --> 01:43:43.040]  And part of that is just feeding each other out, seeing how much they can deceive one another.
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:50.766]  But I have always resisted those that have said that because Rothschild or Kissinger visits Putin, that Putin's a globalist.
[01:43:51.326 --> 01:43:54.973]  He is not a globalist under the control of the western globalists.
[01:43:54.973 --> 01:43:56.395]  He's a competitor.
[01:43:56.395 --> 01:43:59.801]  And he's intending to annihilate them and China with nuclear.
[01:43:59.801 --> 01:44:02.025]  And China's intending to annihilate us and Russia.
[01:44:02.728 --> 01:44:07.850]  But, so this is going to be a very complex thing we're working at now.
[01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:22.616]  And the main reason, as you talked about in the other, that the globalists have suddenly turned against Russia, instead of being complacent and permissive about Russia, is because Russia has the capacity of destroying the terrorist agenda in the Middle East.
[01:44:22.616 --> 01:44:26.118]  The US and British intelligence created ISIS, they created Al-Qaeda.
[01:44:27.458 --> 01:44:37.144]  In 2013, they pulled a false flag chemical attack on Damascus to blame it on Assad.
[01:44:37.144 --> 01:44:38.665]  That triggered the red line of Obama.
[01:44:38.665 --> 01:44:41.127]  He was getting prepared to attack Syria.
[01:44:41.127 --> 01:44:44.409]  And now they've been caught again doing it today.
[01:44:44.409 --> 01:44:45.269]  Exactly.
[01:44:45.269 --> 01:44:46.630]  And I'm covering that in the World Affairs.
[01:44:46.630 --> 01:44:49.412]  This has got all the marks of a false flag operation.
[01:44:49.952 --> 01:44:51.953]  First of all, we have the very groups bragging.
[01:44:51.953 --> 01:44:56.416]  Their problem is their Al-Nusra people love to be rock stars, so they're not completely controlled.
[01:44:56.416 --> 01:45:01.440]  So we even have the video of the attack a few years ago where they're loading the chemical mortars.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:02.861]  I mean, it's all there.
[01:45:02.861 --> 01:45:06.003]  They're so uncoordinated that they brag when they do it.
[01:45:06.003 --> 01:45:12.367]  The media puts out, you know, it's Assad, but then their own little minions want to be rock stars, so they shoot videos of it and brag.
[01:45:12.367 --> 01:45:14.649]  We have that on InfoWars.com, New Breaking Stuff.
[01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:17.531]  Well, this was a little more sophisticated this time.
[01:45:17.531 --> 01:45:25.156]  They enticed an airstrike from Syrian aircraft upon their position and nailed the province.
[01:45:25.156 --> 01:45:35.522]  And at the same time those bombs fell, they exploded a chemical bomb, setting off the chemical warfare, so that they could blame it on the, as if it was an aerial delivery bomb.
[01:45:36.002 --> 01:45:41.145]  Remember Syria gave up its chemical weapons in 2014, certified by international inspectors.
[01:45:41.145 --> 01:45:49.490]  Number two, gas attacks are broad area weapons that have no military value in a rebel conflict fighting among civilians.
[01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:51.571]  All it does is turn the civilians against you.
[01:45:51.571 --> 01:45:52.051]  That's right.
[01:45:52.051 --> 01:45:53.212]  So Assad has no motive to do it.
[01:45:53.832 --> 01:45:54.593]  That's right.
[01:45:54.593 --> 01:45:59.258]  Unless you meant to kill civilians for the purpose of poisoning public opinion against Syria.
[01:45:59.258 --> 01:46:00.980]  And that's exactly what they did.
[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:08.508]  And number three, there's no way Assad would use chemical weapons against civilians knowing that the international community is just waiting for him to make a mistake.
[01:46:09.068 --> 01:46:11.151]  Just what military advantage do you gain?
[01:46:11.151 --> 01:46:12.774]  We're back to red line number two.
[01:46:12.774 --> 01:46:13.595]  Well, of course.
[01:46:13.595 --> 01:46:14.696]  We've already caught them once.
[01:46:14.696 --> 01:46:16.079]  It's called the Telltale Signs.
[01:46:16.079 --> 01:46:18.983]  Syrian girl whose family was from the former ruling party.
[01:46:18.983 --> 01:46:21.907]  She's got all the intel, the articles up on Infowars.com.
[01:46:21.907 --> 01:46:23.890]  But Joel, let me just back up for a minute here.
[01:46:24.691 --> 01:46:29.855]  You do have globalists trying to play off the Anglo-Americans, the Chinese, the Russian Combine.
[01:46:29.855 --> 01:46:33.138]  The globalists in their writings admit there are three major centers of power.
[01:46:33.138 --> 01:46:35.199]  You know, they pretend like it's monopolar.
[01:46:35.199 --> 01:46:36.060]  It's not even bipolar.
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:38.162]  It's obviously beyond, you know, tripolar.
[01:46:38.162 --> 01:46:43.246]  If you count into just nationalistic or movements of liberty, that could, you know, be a fourth or fifth movement.
[01:46:44.306 --> 01:46:52.589]  But if you're looking at this, clearly the globalists are trying to siphon and play games and make the Anglo-American be the dominant group in the end.
[01:46:52.589 --> 01:46:58.151]  As you've broken down correctly, I wouldn't call it a theory, it's a fact from my own research of what they're saying.
[01:46:58.151 --> 01:47:07.494]  But Trump truly trying to shake this up and create prosperity again, and not totally get rid of all the globalism, but just not make it so predatory towards everybody, and try to head off
[01:47:07.774 --> 01:47:14.938]  This coming war that he knows they're planning, because he wants to have golf courses and wealth and his kids to be president, and he isn't a Satanist.
[01:47:14.938 --> 01:47:15.578]  He's not pervished.
[01:47:15.578 --> 01:47:17.619]  He's not a Satanist out to get us.
[01:47:17.619 --> 01:47:20.000]  That's really shaking up their system.
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:26.564]  But then I kind of like you were saying, it's like it could accidentally maybe trigger it, but then you can't just back down to the belligerents.
[01:47:26.564 --> 01:47:31.766]  You need to get in the belligerent's face before they have weapons that can match what you're doing.
[01:47:31.766 --> 01:47:33.127]  So things have gotten wild.
[01:47:33.127 --> 01:47:36.649]  But then he brings in more and more of these globalist neocons in.
[01:47:37.869 --> 01:47:40.871]  And it appears it's starting to soften on some fronts.
[01:47:40.871 --> 01:47:47.615]  I think it's because there's total mutiny, the deep state's ignoring everything he's saying, and it's just an unprecedented time to be alive.
[01:47:48.905 --> 01:47:50.686]  Well, it's very interesting to watch.
[01:47:50.686 --> 01:47:56.229]  This gambit of the false flags, chemical attack in Syria worked against Trump.
[01:47:56.229 --> 01:48:00.811]  Trump came down and condemned Assad for killing innocent people and women and children.
[01:48:00.811 --> 01:48:02.272]  So he's bought into this.
[01:48:02.272 --> 01:48:08.795]  So he doesn't understand that his own security forces created ISIS.
[01:48:08.795 --> 01:48:11.076]  He doesn't understand that they're still working there.
[01:48:11.076 --> 01:48:12.637]  They're still altering the targets.
[01:48:12.637 --> 01:48:15.038]  They're still letting ISIS leaders
[01:48:15.738 --> 01:48:17.380]  It's very possible and that's why he had to be removed.
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:18.821]  They don't want that kind of voice in there.
[01:48:18.821 --> 01:48:22.145]  Remember too that the White House is in chaos because of the fact that
[01:48:34.434 --> 01:48:37.578]  The bureaucracy is not controlled by Trump.
[01:48:37.578 --> 01:48:40.342]  They're starting to basically go back to their Obama agenda.
[01:48:40.342 --> 01:48:42.525]  I mean, they're bringing in hundreds of thousands of refugees.
[01:48:42.525 --> 01:48:43.866]  They're not even vetting them now.
[01:48:43.866 --> 01:48:45.489]  The IRS guy is still there?
[01:48:45.489 --> 01:48:46.270]  I mean, it's just... That's right.
[01:48:47.259 --> 01:49:01.005]  None of that has been cleaned out, Alex, and so what Trump has done, which is a mistake, instead of applying a basic ideological format and filter and bracing all the... He's trying to co-op them, but they're ideologues on their mission.
[01:49:01.005 --> 01:49:01.965]  They're not mercenaries.
[01:49:01.965 --> 01:49:05.527]  Trump thinks they're mercenaries, and if he just gives them power, he'll carry out the agenda.
[01:49:05.527 --> 01:49:05.967]  No!
[01:49:05.967 --> 01:49:09.188]  They want to destroy this system and bring in the tyranny.
[01:49:09.188 --> 01:49:10.589]  It's about total domination.
[01:49:11.209 --> 01:49:23.055]  It is, but Trump is making a mistake by surrounding himself like he does in business with extremely loyal, carefully selected people like Jared Kushner, his son-in-law.
[01:49:23.055 --> 01:49:25.136]  But Kushner is a Democrat at heart.
[01:49:25.136 --> 01:49:26.497]  Yeah, what do you make of Kushner?
[01:49:26.497 --> 01:49:35.542]  I mean, we've confirmed, we have the sources, he is leaking against people in the administration thinking it's a power struggle when he's the one wounding Trump.
[01:49:37.028 --> 01:49:39.871]  Well, you know, Trump trusts him implicitly.
[01:49:39.871 --> 01:49:45.777]  I mean, look, to send Kushner to Mexico, to China to negotiate and to Iraq.
[01:49:45.777 --> 01:49:48.339]  I mean, Kushner has no background whatsoever to understand.
[01:49:48.339 --> 01:49:52.764]  He doesn't understand any of the conspiratorial issues involved with any three of those countries.
[01:49:52.764 --> 01:49:53.765]  How could he negotiate?
[01:49:54.225 --> 01:50:06.151]  But Trump is not looking for answers as much as he's surrounding the wagons and basically trying to stop the leaks by saying I'm only going to talk to my insider group and it's a real mistake.
[01:50:06.151 --> 01:50:10.053]  He really needs to purge the traitors that are in the administration.
[01:50:10.053 --> 01:50:12.334]  Do you think Kushner consciously is betraying the President?
[01:50:13.686 --> 01:50:14.307]  No, I don't.
[01:50:14.307 --> 01:50:15.248]  I think he's loyal to it.
[01:50:15.248 --> 01:50:17.169]  He just doesn't know what he's doing.
[01:50:17.169 --> 01:50:22.715]  And he is trying to work this infighting thing by, you know, trying to attack people on the outside.
[01:50:22.715 --> 01:50:28.360]  The media is just having a laughing fit at all the infighting going on in the administration.
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:31.083]  They just say this thing is exploding.
[01:50:31.083 --> 01:50:33.385]  Let me ask you what do you think the American people can do?
[01:50:34.446 --> 01:50:36.047]  To try to continue this route of the globalists.
[01:50:36.047 --> 01:50:37.027]  I mean, it's spreading.
[01:50:37.027 --> 01:50:38.048]  Globalism's exposed.
[01:50:38.048 --> 01:50:39.709]  It's in trouble, finally.
[01:50:39.709 --> 01:50:42.530]  And, you know, Trump is not our only card.
[01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:46.892]  But I tell ya... I tell ya, I'm not abandoning Trump at any front.
[01:50:46.892 --> 01:50:47.973]  I think he's done a lot of great things.
[01:50:47.973 --> 01:50:52.815]  It's just that letting Kushner and others sit there... I mean, I don't care if they're family or not.
[01:50:52.815 --> 01:50:56.797]  If I caught somebody doing something like that in my life, they would be out of my life in two seconds.
[01:50:56.797 --> 01:50:57.998]  I'd say, you get your stuff.
[01:50:57.998 --> 01:50:58.938]  You get your ass out of here.
[01:50:58.938 --> 01:50:59.819]  I'm never talking to you again.
[01:51:00.936 --> 01:51:02.877]  Hi there, Dick Allgaier here.
[01:51:02.877 --> 01:51:07.260]  I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[01:51:07.260 --> 01:51:10.743]  I normally never do commercial endorsements.
[01:51:10.743 --> 01:51:13.404]  I am very skeptical of health supplements.
[01:51:13.404 --> 01:51:17.507]  But a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One.
[01:51:17.507 --> 01:51:21.870]  So I purchased a bottle and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now.
[01:51:22.210 --> 01:51:25.231]  I very much dislike so-called energy boosters.
[01:51:25.231 --> 01:51:30.994]  Those little energy drinks that have caffeine and guarana and other things that make your heart race.
[01:51:30.994 --> 01:51:32.114]  This is not that.
[01:51:32.114 --> 01:51:35.375]  My experience with Synergy One has been great.
[01:51:35.375 --> 01:51:36.616]  My mood is better.
[01:51:36.616 --> 01:51:37.997]  My joints feel better.
[01:51:37.997 --> 01:51:42.558]  I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity.
[01:51:42.558 --> 01:51:46.180]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more.
[01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:48.161]  So I recommend Synergy One.
[01:51:48.161 --> 01:51:49.261]  It's really good stuff.
[01:51:49.261 --> 01:51:51.042]  I'm having great results with it.

[01:53:00.558 --> 01:53:02.379]  Do you have the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:53:02.379 --> 01:53:04.020]  Are tax debts crippling you?

[01:53:06.841 --> 01:53:09.142]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:53:09.142 --> 01:53:13.644]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:53:29.025 --> 01:53:32.987]  We use cell phones against our heads every day, but now a landmark U.S.

[01:54:30.305 --> 01:54:31.826]  Joel Skousen's our guest.
[01:54:31.826 --> 01:54:33.187]  A little bit in the next hour if he can do it.
[01:54:33.187 --> 01:54:33.707]  He may have to go.
[01:54:33.707 --> 01:54:34.968]  I forgot to ask him during the break.
[01:54:34.968 --> 01:54:37.089]  WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[01:54:37.089 --> 01:54:39.791]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[01:54:39.791 --> 01:54:45.715]  Normally, if they try to censor you, it makes you the bad boy and everybody wants to come see what you're doing and saying.
[01:54:45.715 --> 01:54:48.417]  Unless they're successful at shutting you down.
[01:54:48.417 --> 01:54:51.759]  And they are hitting us on every front economically.
[01:54:51.759 --> 01:54:52.640]  It's actually dizzying.
[01:54:53.735 --> 01:55:03.261]  But then all I do is go and ask you to buy the products, and I'm sincere about it, and a lot of what we've had taken away from us has ended up coming back in.
[01:55:03.261 --> 01:55:09.865]  But then I wonder, you know, if the attacks continue down the road, it's going to start crippling us.
[01:55:09.865 --> 01:55:14.568]  And I'll let the enemy know it's having that effect, because all I have is transparency here.
[01:55:14.568 --> 01:55:16.489]  I'm not going to sit here and say, oh, we're doing wonderful.
[01:55:17.961 --> 01:55:20.242]  I want to expand in the face of this.
[01:55:20.242 --> 01:55:23.203]  And so, I do not want what they're doing to us to cut into that.
[01:55:23.203 --> 01:55:30.427]  So, I'm just telling the listeners, if you want to win this fight, you need to go to worldaffairsbrief.com and subscribe to it to film what Joel does.

[01:55:46.415 --> 01:55:48.136]  We're setting up those promo codes today.
[01:55:48.136 --> 01:55:51.078]  There's the new Trump 45th President of the United States shirt.
[01:55:51.078 --> 01:55:52.819]  It's all there.
[01:55:52.819 --> 01:55:54.461]  Because this is an epic time.
[01:55:54.461 --> 01:56:04.268]  But more important than that is your prayers and your support by spreading the links and articles to everybody out there.
[01:56:04.268 --> 01:56:05.709]  Because that's the real power you have.
[01:56:06.564 --> 01:56:15.208]  But Trump needs to go in with Congress and get rid of this ministry of truth Obama set up and the stay behind networks of the deep state and the open rebellions.
[01:56:15.208 --> 01:56:18.570]  Good news is happening with Susan Rice and all the truth coming out on that.
[01:56:18.570 --> 01:56:21.952]  It's just that once one lies exposed, they move on to a new hoax.
[01:56:21.952 --> 01:56:24.173]  So, Joel, what do you think the president should do?
[01:56:25.314 --> 01:56:26.335]  Uh, what do you think?
[01:56:26.335 --> 01:56:30.218]  They're trying to isolate him, but I know that he does routinely watch and listen to segments of the show.
[01:56:30.218 --> 01:56:33.402]  Uh, especially if I say he measures the president from Alex Jones.
[01:56:33.402 --> 01:56:36.865]  He's told me several times, and, uh, his staff have told me about it as well.
[01:56:36.865 --> 01:56:41.129]  So, in this little segment and the next, I mean, what would you like to say to the president, but also the American people?
[01:56:41.129 --> 01:56:41.730]  What can we do?
[01:56:41.730 --> 01:56:44.393]  Because this is the historic battle that we're entering, is it not?
[01:56:45.876 --> 01:56:48.900]  It is.
[01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:56.869]  I listed in last week's World Affairs Brief, for example, four or five things that Trump has done that have been absolutely stunning and fulfilling campaign promises.
[01:56:56.869 --> 01:57:04.639]  Stopping the TPP, starting to build a wall, taking the handcuffs off the Border Patrol and ICE to start deportations.
[01:57:06.020 --> 01:57:10.506]  And he's taken away the climate control agenda that Obama mandated.
[01:57:10.506 --> 01:57:15.893]  He's taken away the clean coal restrictions that Obama, which would have destroyed the coal industry.
[01:57:15.893 --> 01:57:18.917]  All those things are excellent.
[01:57:18.917 --> 01:57:21.740]  The health care thing was a disaster.
[01:57:22.501 --> 01:57:30.128]  But in reaction to that, even though Steve Bannon, you know, he said, you know, you need to put together a list of the bad guys and remember who betrayed you in this.
[01:57:30.128 --> 01:57:38.175]  But Trump, fortunately, went golfing with Rand Paul this week and got an earful about how to do this properly.
[01:57:38.175 --> 01:57:39.837]  He needs Rand Paul's help, doesn't he?
[01:57:40.933 --> 01:57:52.397]  He really does, and I was frankly surprised that after all the vindictiveness, all the revenge that he expressed against the Freedom Caucus, that he would go golfing with Rand Paul and listen to him about how to do this.
[01:57:52.397 --> 01:57:54.638]  And I think Rand Paul has an effect.
[01:57:54.638 --> 01:57:58.159]  I went in detail in last week's Brief, Rand Paul's proposal.
[01:57:58.159 --> 01:58:08.262]  I'm sad to say that Rand did compromise after talking with the President and saying, well, we can still accept some form of subsidies just by not repealing that part of
[01:58:08.302 --> 01:58:08.983]  I know what they're doing.
[01:58:08.983 --> 01:58:10.245]  They're hitting the liberal side of Trump.
[01:58:10.245 --> 01:58:14.230]  They're like, sir, these people are going uninsured and, you know, you can mend fences.
[01:58:14.230 --> 01:58:14.991]  It's never going to happen.
[01:58:14.991 --> 01:58:17.074]  It's going to bankrupt the country just slower.
[01:58:17.074 --> 01:58:17.835]  We have to kill it.
[01:58:19.269 --> 01:58:20.450]  Yeah.
[01:58:20.450 --> 01:58:30.557]  But I still think that Rand Paul is the way to go, that he will, in fact, have a proposal that can fly in Congress.
[01:58:30.557 --> 01:58:31.778]  Here's what Trump needs to do.
[01:58:31.778 --> 01:58:34.460]  First of all, he needs to get control of that bureaucracy.
[01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:36.241]  I mean, this is just utterly unacceptable.
[01:58:36.241 --> 01:58:38.762]  Let's talk about how we do that as a former Marine Corps officer.
[01:58:38.762 --> 01:58:39.643]  How would you get in there?
[01:58:39.643 --> 01:58:41.824]  People aren't doing their jobs anyway.
[01:58:41.824 --> 01:58:44.666]  Just fire basically everybody that doesn't immediately do what they're told.
[01:58:44.666 --> 01:58:46.227]  I'd just start randomly firing everybody.
[01:58:46.227 --> 01:58:47.788]  They won't even hang his photos up at VA's.
[01:58:48.789 --> 01:58:50.530]  We'll be back.
[01:58:50.530 --> 01:58:54.713]  There was a mighty nation, blessed above all of creation.
[01:58:54.713 --> 01:58:57.374]  Charlie Daniels, he's always loved America.
[01:58:57.374 --> 01:58:58.955]  Let me just read a little thing here.
[01:58:58.955 --> 01:59:03.237]  The American system of justice must be changed to conform to the rest of the world.
[01:59:03.237 --> 01:59:07.040]  Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:08.721]  Well, you know what the next move's gonna be, don't you?
[01:59:08.721 --> 01:59:10.282]  It's gonna be coming after your guns.
[01:59:10.282 --> 01:59:10.682]  Oh, yeah.
[01:59:10.682 --> 01:59:12.823]  I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way.
[01:59:12.823 --> 01:59:13.443]  At all.
[01:59:13.443 --> 01:59:14.504]  It ain't gonna sit well.
[01:59:14.504 --> 01:59:16.905]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[01:59:16.905 --> 01:59:17.606]  They lost.
[01:59:18.066 --> 01:59:18.907]  We won.
[01:59:18.907 --> 01:59:21.088]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[01:59:21.088 --> 01:59:22.389]  It's time to ride, boys.
[01:59:22.389 --> 01:59:24.291]  We need a thousand Paul Revere's.
[01:59:24.291 --> 01:59:30.376]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom, and apple pie.
[01:59:30.376 --> 01:59:32.718]  And beef was for supper.
[01:59:32.718 --> 01:59:35.320]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:37.161]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[01:59:37.161 --> 01:59:38.683]  DVDs now available.
[01:59:38.683 --> 01:59:42.986]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[01:59:43.326 --> 01:59:46.709]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:49.052]  RevelationsTheMovie.info.
[01:59:49.052 --> 01:59:52.955]  Let's fix it.
[01:59:52.955 --> 01:59:55.558]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:03.257 --> 02:00:06.859]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:00:06.859 --> 02:00:11.001]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:23.607 --> 02:00:25.569]  Alright, Joel Skousen is our guest.
[02:00:25.569 --> 02:00:32.577]  I'm going to open the phones up specifically on the North Korea Peninsula, the South China Sea, geopolitical issues.
[02:00:32.577 --> 02:00:34.239]  That's a wide area.
[02:00:34.239 --> 02:00:38.924]  He's with us at the bottom of the hour, then Millie Weaver's going to pop in on our pedophile network.
[02:00:39.885 --> 02:00:40.866]  We're good to go.
[02:00:55.623 --> 02:01:04.789]  We actually told the police and others, no, we just want to see how they're doing it on the dark web, how that's happening and expose this.
[02:01:04.789 --> 02:01:05.850]  I'm not looking at it.
[02:01:05.850 --> 02:01:07.711]  So I will not look at it.
[02:01:07.711 --> 02:01:08.832]  It would hurt you just to look at that.
[02:01:08.832 --> 02:01:12.314]  I mean, I warn everybody, folks, I would not ever look at even an investigation of child porn.
[02:01:12.314 --> 02:01:14.336]  I don't know how people even do it.
[02:01:14.336 --> 02:01:15.937]  So we're going to be getting into all of that.
[02:01:17.355 --> 02:01:21.396]  I've never seen such pushback that when we start getting into the whole pedophile network, it's the satanism.
[02:01:21.396 --> 02:01:23.196]  And folks, it's so huge.
[02:01:23.196 --> 02:01:27.737]  I've met with so many people that are involved with you name it.
[02:01:27.737 --> 02:01:29.257]  I can't really say all the agencies.
[02:01:29.257 --> 02:01:31.738]  And they just say, Alex, it's even worse than they're saying.
[02:01:31.738 --> 02:01:37.239]  And then we can't ever get above the procurer's three levels up.
[02:01:37.239 --> 02:01:40.879]  It just gets killed by major police departments, you name it.
[02:01:40.879 --> 02:01:42.840]  It's protected.
[02:01:42.840 --> 02:01:43.620]  And 12-year-old girls.
[02:01:46.903 --> 02:01:50.890]  You know, going around delivering drugs on top of having sex with people is the tip of the iceberg.
[02:01:50.890 --> 02:01:53.915]  And that's done just out in the open now.
[02:01:53.915 --> 02:01:58.343]  So... I'm not going to say anymore.
[02:01:58.343 --> 02:01:58.944]  The problem is...
[02:02:02.021 --> 02:02:05.742]  I learn all this stuff, and then I get chewed out if I even talk about any of it.
[02:02:05.742 --> 02:02:07.622]  In fact, I haven't talked about any of it.
[02:02:07.622 --> 02:02:08.923]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[02:02:08.923 --> 02:02:12.564]  And I also tend to shy away from all this because I don't like focusing on it.
[02:02:12.564 --> 02:02:13.804]  I don't like it.
[02:02:13.804 --> 02:02:15.744]  I've got children, and it makes me feel angry.
[02:02:15.744 --> 02:02:18.585]  It makes me feel, quite frankly, violent.
[02:02:18.585 --> 02:02:20.865]  And then I start blowing up, which is not an act.
[02:02:20.865 --> 02:02:27.607]  At a certain point, a switch gets flipped, and that's why I've been lacking covering this the last decade.
[02:02:28.871 --> 02:02:30.691]  A decade ago or more, I covered it a lot.
[02:02:30.691 --> 02:02:32.972]  I saw Paul Watson got hired because he was in Britain.
[02:02:32.972 --> 02:02:34.732]  He sees it all over the news.
[02:02:34.732 --> 02:02:38.353]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[02:02:38.353 --> 02:02:41.134]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:02:41.134 --> 02:02:42.954]  Some stations don't carry this first five minutes.
[02:02:42.954 --> 02:02:43.454]  A lot do.
[02:02:43.454 --> 02:02:45.215]  We do it a little bit different clock and format.
[02:02:45.215 --> 02:02:50.056]  That's why I've got Joel sitting there on hold because I want him to be able to speak for about five minutes directly to the President.
[02:02:50.056 --> 02:02:56.017]  We're going to edit it together later and put it out as Joel Skousen's, you know, a warning to President Trump so that he can actually
[02:02:56.397 --> 02:03:00.279]  You know, not have me cutting in over it, so we're going to come back from break and give him the floor for a couple minutes.
[02:03:00.279 --> 02:03:07.883]  But just two minutes before we come back and do that, Joel, the toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[02:03:07.883 --> 02:03:08.503]  800-259-9231.
[02:03:08.503 --> 02:03:11.605]  First-time callers are folks that got good phones, is all I'm asking.
[02:03:11.605 --> 02:03:15.787]  In the minute and a half we have left before we go to break, other tidbits.
[02:03:15.787 --> 02:03:19.769]  You were revising your forecast that's been pretty much dead on.
[02:03:19.769 --> 02:03:20.329]  You've been saying for
[02:03:22.076 --> 02:03:28.999]  Well, 18, 19 years ago, you said between 2017 and 2020, nuclear war triggered in Korea.
[02:03:28.999 --> 02:03:32.781]  In the last few years, you said, well, more like they're behind schedule.
[02:03:32.781 --> 02:03:34.622]  So you'd say maybe 2020, 2022.
[02:03:34.622 --> 02:03:36.563]  You said this hundreds of times here.
[02:03:36.563 --> 02:03:40.685]  Now you're going, oh, no, let me take it back to what I said, you know, 19 years ago.
[02:03:40.685 --> 02:03:43.506]  That's that's pretty spooky when you've got such credibility with your track record.
[02:03:44.861 --> 02:03:52.832]  Well, it is true that Russia and China aren't ready, but that doesn't mean that they may not see a tactical advantage.
[02:03:52.832 --> 02:03:54.555]  And the globalists may see a tactical advantage.
[02:03:54.555 --> 02:03:57.419]  You know, normally I've always said the globalists can't start this war.
[02:03:57.419 --> 02:04:00.543]  They have to wait for Russia and China to start it.
[02:04:01.164 --> 02:04:12.490]  But it looks like the scenario is waking up where they can, through globalists that are trying to manipulate Trump, they can get him to preemptively work or strike against North Korea and trigger World War III early.
[02:04:12.490 --> 02:04:23.456]  Now that actually is to the advantage of the globalists, because if they can get Russia and China to go to war before they're fully ready, then there's a greater chance that they can beat Russia.
[02:04:24.196 --> 02:04:34.124]  As I've also said, strategy-wise, I think the globalists during this war will cut a deal with Red China to betray Russia, to attack its rear, just as they made a deal with us.
[02:04:34.124 --> 02:04:39.047]  You said that over 10 years ago, and clearly now Russia is on the menu.
[02:04:39.047 --> 02:04:40.669]  I mean, they really want war with Russia.
[02:04:40.669 --> 02:04:42.970]  So clearly, it's up next, right?
[02:04:42.970 --> 02:04:44.752]  And Russia's going down, I believe.
[02:04:44.752 --> 02:04:51.297]  I don't believe they're going to win this war, but it's going to be devastating to the US military, because our government is going to absorb a nuclear first strike,
[02:04:52.276 --> 02:04:55.778]  In order to justify getting us into a militarized global government.
[02:04:55.778 --> 02:04:59.080]  But it is true that the Russians listen to the show.
[02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:00.441]  We'll be back.
[02:05:00.441 --> 02:05:01.401]  Tensions are high.
[02:05:01.401 --> 02:05:04.603]  Border wall contractors brace for a hostile environment.
[02:05:04.603 --> 02:05:11.787]  One potential bidder on President Donald Trump's border wall wanted to know if authorities would rush to help if workers came under hostile attack.
[02:05:11.787 --> 02:05:19.772]  Another asked if employees can carry firearms in states with strict gun control laws and if the government would indemnify them for using deadly force.
[02:05:19.972 --> 02:05:27.455]  With bids due Tuesday on the first design contracts, interesting companies are preparing for the worst if they get the potentially lucrative job.
[02:05:27.455 --> 02:05:27.836]  A U.S.
[02:05:27.836 --> 02:05:35.279]  official with knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity said four to ten bidders are expected to be chosen to build prototypes.
[02:05:35.319 --> 02:05:35.879]  We're good to go.
[02:06:00.578 --> 02:06:02.399]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:06:02.399 --> 02:06:09.003]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:06:09.003 --> 02:06:12.164]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[02:06:12.164 --> 02:06:21.950]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:22.790]  Caveman.
[02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:27.853]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:06:27.853 --> 02:06:29.974]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:06:30.274 --> 02:06:33.416]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:06:33.416 --> 02:06:38.559]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:06:38.559 --> 02:06:46.704]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:06:46.704 --> 02:06:54.649]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.

[02:08:10.925 --> 02:08:15.007]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:08:15.007 --> 02:08:17.467]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:17.467 --> 02:08:20.549]  Well, let me just declare where I stand in this.
[02:08:20.549 --> 02:08:23.390]  I don't want the Anglo-American establishment to win world government.
[02:08:23.390 --> 02:08:25.530]  I don't want the Russian establishment to have it.
[02:08:25.530 --> 02:08:27.211]  The Communist Chinese.
[02:08:27.211 --> 02:08:34.614]  I want a world based on productivity and being open and honorable and on what you actually produce and what you stand for.
[02:08:34.614 --> 02:08:37.635]  And I want to believe in our species and I want us to go to the next level.
[02:08:38.315 --> 02:08:44.104]  I want us to be open and free and quite frankly a true Christian system.
[02:08:44.104 --> 02:08:51.814]  We don't force people to, free will, but we need to be open to build our free open systems that then everyone can see are the model.
[02:08:52.915 --> 02:08:58.158]  Doesn't mean I'm on some high horse, doesn't mean I've got all the answers, but I'm not out to get people.
[02:08:58.158 --> 02:09:04.481]  And Trump undoubtedly has a spirit of productivity and wealth, and he likes seeing people doing well.
[02:09:04.481 --> 02:09:17.046]  He's very hard-nosed, but he isn't out to get people like a Madeleine Albright or others that like you being poor, you know, whose father robbed the Jews and she was Jewish, or towards Soros, the same story.
[02:09:17.046 --> 02:09:20.728]  The Communist Chinese, there's a wickedness where they want you poor.
[02:09:20.728 --> 02:09:21.389]  They want you.
[02:09:21.389 --> 02:09:21.929]  It's feudalism.
[02:09:22.836 --> 02:09:25.277]  Under their control, you could have seen humanity blossom.
[02:09:25.277 --> 02:09:26.697]  It's very anti-human.
[02:09:26.697 --> 02:09:32.840]  Like the Bible says, fallen one, here to deceive, here to destroy us, here to steal our future.
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:34.841]  You can say, well, that's the Bible, I don't believe it.
[02:09:34.841 --> 02:09:43.144]  Okay, well, whether it's real or not, and of course it is, not men's interpretations, but what it is, is, is already here.
[02:09:43.144 --> 02:09:43.724]  It's all proven.
[02:09:43.724 --> 02:09:48.666]  They're announcing microchips to work at all these companies, Associated Press, brain chips for the troops.
[02:09:48.666 --> 02:09:51.547]  It's all just being announced now like it's no big deal.
[02:09:51.547 --> 02:09:51.687]  So,
[02:09:52.964 --> 02:09:56.466]  Great evil is coming upon the earth right now.
[02:09:56.466 --> 02:10:03.370]  And the big megachurches are controlled, folks.
[02:10:03.370 --> 02:10:06.632]  And so I don't know what we're supposed to do other than just spread the word and take action.
[02:10:06.632 --> 02:10:10.814]  I want to take some phone calls here, but Joel Skousen, you got caught off by the break earlier.
[02:10:10.814 --> 02:10:11.815]  Thank you for joining us today.
[02:10:11.815 --> 02:10:17.478]  Editor-in-Chief of WorldAtFirstBrief.com has been right on target with the whole North Korea situation for
[02:10:18.646 --> 02:10:20.748]  Close to two decades that I know.
[02:10:20.748 --> 02:10:28.375]  Can you get into then what you think the president should do with this mutiny of the deep state where they're acting like Obama never left?
[02:10:28.375 --> 02:10:30.237]  Obama said he would do that.
[02:10:30.237 --> 02:10:31.058]  Just the arrogance.
[02:10:31.058 --> 02:10:32.079]  What does the president do?
[02:10:32.079 --> 02:10:33.861]  I know he doesn't want to look too mean.
[02:10:33.861 --> 02:10:35.402]  Well, they're the ones that are in open rebellion.
[02:10:36.405 --> 02:10:42.070]  In major elite publications saying overthrow the president, use COG to overthrow the president.
[02:10:42.070 --> 02:10:44.091]  I could see months ago that's what they were setting up.
[02:10:44.091 --> 02:10:44.752]  Now they admit it.
[02:10:44.752 --> 02:10:46.493]  I don't think they got the idea from me.
[02:10:46.493 --> 02:10:48.355]  I could see what they were preparing.
[02:10:48.355 --> 02:10:49.856]  They may make a real run at the president.
[02:10:49.856 --> 02:10:57.462]  So can you brief him in the next 5-10 minutes and we'll take a few calls on what you think his number one threat is and then what you would do.
[02:10:59.181 --> 02:11:05.166]  Well, the number one threat to Donald Trump are the globalist neocons that he's allowed to get in the administration.
[02:11:05.166 --> 02:11:06.027]  About 50%.
[02:11:06.027 --> 02:11:10.111]  And they're in some of the most important positions now.
[02:11:10.111 --> 02:11:15.616]  They're in the National Security Council, they're in the Department of State, and they're in the Department of Defense.
[02:11:15.616 --> 02:11:17.538]  And so they're controlling foreign policy.
[02:11:18.098 --> 02:11:21.199]  And that's why he's getting bad information about the Syria false flag attack.
[02:11:21.199 --> 02:11:22.559]  Now here's how you control that.
[02:11:22.559 --> 02:11:25.600]  First of all, you've got to get control of the bureaucracy.
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:30.701]  When George W. Bush was president, his handler was Vice President Dick Cheney.
[02:11:30.701 --> 02:11:35.882]  Dick Cheney expanded the Vice President's office from a staff of approximately 15 to over 600.
[02:11:35.882 --> 02:11:39.963]  He had people in every agency of government
[02:11:41.118 --> 02:11:45.920]  Dictating, watching over, filtering, and making sure that people obeyed what he wanted to do.
[02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:53.504]  And it wasn't, you know, George W. Bush was basically... And from his huge residence down the street, from that building, he ran the whole show.
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:57.461]  Yeah, from the National Observatory, where the Vice President's residence is.
[02:11:57.461 --> 02:12:07.102]  And during his tenure, he built a great big nuclear underground bunker underneath that building, so that the Vice President had a personal bunker against nuclear attack.
[02:12:07.102 --> 02:12:09.363]  The government obviously knows this is coming.
[02:12:09.363 --> 02:12:14.964]  So, the second thing that Donald Trump needs to do immediately is repeal PDD 60.
[02:12:14.964 --> 02:12:19.805]  That is the Presidential Decision Directive that basically instructs our nuclear forces to not
[02:12:22.385 --> 02:12:26.331]  Launch on warning but to prepare to absorb a nuclear first strike.
[02:12:26.331 --> 02:12:30.937]  PDD-60 is a devastating thing and Trump doesn't even know about it, I'm convinced.
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:38.964]  Now the third thing he needs to do, he needs to get a briefing from people who understand the globalist conspiracy.
[02:12:38.964 --> 02:12:41.685]  I'm convinced he does not understand the details.
[02:12:41.685 --> 02:12:44.767]  He understands in general there is a globalist conspiracy.
[02:12:44.767 --> 02:12:56.053]  Without knowing the details, especially as it pertains to foreign policy, false flag operation, terrorism, 9-11, creation of ISIS, he cannot operate with a general feeling about globalism.
[02:12:56.713 --> 02:13:05.262]  The third thing he needs to create is an ombudsman for the conservative movement, for his own supporters, if you will.
[02:13:05.262 --> 02:13:10.348]  In other words, he needs to have someone who people on this side of the spectrum can contact.
[02:13:10.348 --> 02:13:13.772]  We don't have any way to contact the Trump administration.
[02:13:13.772 --> 02:13:15.994]  He needs to organize and rally his true base.
[02:13:16.895 --> 02:13:20.598]  Exactly, and you do that by giving them the ability to give feedback.
[02:13:20.598 --> 02:13:25.642]  Someone who has direct access to the present can take that feedback, and who's sympathetic to it.
[02:13:25.642 --> 02:13:30.446]  Who will not filter out things just because they have the taint of conspiracy theories.
[02:13:30.446 --> 02:13:34.490]  And Bannon was supposed to do that, but then he got so attacked by the media, he went into a fortress mode.
[02:13:37.085 --> 02:13:41.128]  That's right, although I'm not sure Bannon has the full credentials to do that.
[02:13:41.128 --> 02:13:50.374]  You know, he really needs to sit down with you and me and Dr. Chuck Baldwin or other people who really understand what's going on, who can brief him in a credible way.
[02:14:07.386 --> 02:14:09.910]  Even UKIP said half their members are from Infowars.
[02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:12.174]  And then as soon as they get into power, it's like we don't even exist.
[02:14:12.174 --> 02:14:13.075]  We don't want power.
[02:14:13.075 --> 02:14:14.197]  We're not in Washington.
[02:14:14.197 --> 02:14:16.160]  We want to be as far away from it as possible.
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:20.006]  But the president needs to energize and work with us and understand that.
[02:14:21.459 --> 02:14:22.179]  Well, that's right.
[02:14:22.179 --> 02:14:31.243]  And unfortunately, once you're president, you get so overwhelmed with briefings and your schedule gets so full that it's very difficult to get in a word in edgewise.
[02:14:31.243 --> 02:14:32.984]  And that's done on purpose.
[02:14:32.984 --> 02:14:34.925]  That's done on purpose, you're right.
[02:14:34.925 --> 02:14:45.269]  And, you know, the president's a little bit upset with Reince Priebus for manhandling this health care thing and not getting the right people to him.
[02:14:45.269 --> 02:14:48.011]  Priebus kept Rand Paul away from Donald Trump.
[02:14:48.011 --> 02:14:50.612]  Donald Trump never even read the health care bill.
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:54.463]  He simply took what the Republicans have put together.
[02:14:54.463 --> 02:14:55.904]  They lied to him!
[02:14:55.904 --> 02:14:56.985]  That's right.
[02:14:56.985 --> 02:14:58.687]  He said, this is the plan that you want.
[02:14:58.687 --> 02:15:01.329]  He went with it, but he never read it.
[02:15:01.329 --> 02:15:08.276]  And I think he's been stung enough that after talking with Rand Paul, he probably will start to dig into this.
[02:15:08.276 --> 02:15:10.258]  He does sleep very little.
[02:15:10.258 --> 02:15:14.142]  He does spend a lot of early morning hours watching the internet and other things.
[02:15:16.444 --> 02:15:20.167]  By some act of God, we could get some access.
[02:15:20.167 --> 02:15:23.589]  You know, I think Donald Trump has a good heart.
[02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:31.895]  Well sure, you and others have reached out and said, if you talk to Trump, tell him this, half the time I've missed the calls, and the other ones, early on calls were like 15 minutes long, we could really talk.
[02:15:31.895 --> 02:15:36.998]  Now it's like, Alex, a lot of folks watching, he knows everything he's saying is being recorded.
[02:15:36.998 --> 02:15:38.959]  Keep it up, great job, how's the family?
[02:15:38.959 --> 02:15:42.202]  Just keep it up, you know, I'm delivering, are you happy?
[02:15:42.202 --> 02:15:43.863]  It's mainly a pat on the head, and I get that.
[02:15:44.423 --> 02:15:54.512]  But then I thought folks would have to go have private meetings with him and he's literally just like, yeah, and I can't get into it, but I mean, Trump really does want to take on the globalists, but he's so surrounded and he's lied to by everybody.
[02:15:54.512 --> 02:15:57.194]  And I'm not just lionizing him and giving me excuses.
[02:15:57.194 --> 02:15:59.996]  It's they literally lie to his face and then go to the opposite.
[02:15:59.996 --> 02:16:04.080]  He's just surrounded by by a bunch of cowards that are too, too weak to be strong.
[02:16:06.058 --> 02:16:12.602]  Well, he is a good person, but he isn't, you know, one man can't run the huge business like the United States government is.
[02:16:12.602 --> 02:16:14.643]  You've really got to have a large team.
[02:16:14.643 --> 02:16:20.506]  And unfortunately, we don't have a lot of people in our side of the movement to have a lot of experience in government because they're blacklisted.
[02:16:20.506 --> 02:16:25.889]  They cannot get jobs in government, and they cannot deal with the evil in the bureaucracy once they're in there.
[02:16:25.889 --> 02:16:26.229]  Exactly!
[02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:28.431]  They don't let us anywhere near anything.
[02:16:28.431 --> 02:16:31.672]  Of course, you led one of the major movements with Reagan to try to restore things.
[02:16:31.672 --> 02:16:32.393]  That got blocked.
[02:16:33.922 --> 02:16:43.881]  That's right, I was chairman of the Conservative National Committee in the 1980s, trying to stop the Reagan compromise, and it was amazing how much opposition we got from Republicans!
[02:16:44.986 --> 02:16:49.288]  It was the liberal Republicans that did not want us to influence Reagan.
[02:16:49.288 --> 02:16:52.829]  And Reagan had a good heart, but he was influenced by George H.W.
[02:16:52.829 --> 02:17:02.474]  Bush, who was sent in there, forced upon Reagan, in order to control his administration, to give him power over the entire bureaucracy of government, so that he controlled who was hired.
[02:17:02.474 --> 02:17:07.096]  But regardless, we've seen a major wounding, have we not, of the globalist agenda.
[02:17:07.096 --> 02:17:09.737]  Wherever Trump goes, we're back in the fight now.
[02:17:11.072 --> 02:17:15.276]  Well, absolutely, but the retaliation of the globalists is powerful.
[02:17:15.276 --> 02:17:18.899]  For example, they are undermining the Brexit in ways that you wouldn't realize.
[02:17:18.899 --> 02:17:22.822]  Well, let me tell you, they are all over us with intel, I can't believe.
[02:17:22.822 --> 02:17:25.324]  They are just kidding us from every angle financially.
[02:17:25.324 --> 02:17:26.125]  Yeah.
[02:17:26.365 --> 02:17:35.373]  But Theresa May inculcated all EU law into British law and then said, now we'll just pick and choose and remove what we want.
[02:17:35.373 --> 02:17:40.838]  You know, it's ten times as hard to remove a law that has a benefit-corrupted majority supporting it.
[02:17:40.838 --> 02:17:48.204]  Once it's in, it would have been much better to simply cut the breakfast off and just say, we'll start from scratch and we'll take in what we want.
[02:17:48.204 --> 02:17:49.886]  That's right, you've got to get all the tentacles off you.
[02:17:49.886 --> 02:17:53.069]  Let's take a few calls with Joel Scouse and we're going to edit this down, last 20 minutes,
[02:17:53.649 --> 02:17:53.949]  Thank you.
[02:17:53.949 --> 02:17:54.230]  Thank you.
[02:18:11.451 --> 02:18:11.691]  Hi Alex.
[02:18:29.204 --> 02:18:36.910]  The first thing they need to do before they start a war with North Korea is, like you said, they need to go after these people that transferred all the technology there.
[02:18:36.910 --> 02:18:46.156]  They need to go after the ones that transferred the technology to China, because the Chinese would not have the military they have today without these free trade agreements.
[02:18:46.156 --> 02:18:47.417]  I totally agree, Joel.
[02:18:47.417 --> 02:18:52.721]  I mean, is it not high treason that the Clintons, but also some Republicans, transferred everything to China and now North Korea?
[02:18:52.721 --> 02:18:53.402]  That's insane!
[02:18:54.229 --> 02:18:56.591]  Yes, it was done mostly through the Commerce Department.
[02:18:56.591 --> 02:18:58.532]  It happened during the Clinton years.
[02:18:58.532 --> 02:19:00.294]  It happened during the Bush years.
[02:19:00.294 --> 02:19:01.615]  It never stopped.
[02:19:01.615 --> 02:19:08.440]  In fact, Condoleezza Rice was nearly indicted for being involved in a spy scandal with a Chinese person.
[02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:13.244]  Why would you sell ICBM and cruise missile technology to your number one enemy?
[02:19:13.244 --> 02:19:15.085]  What the hell are these people... Excuse me, Lord.
[02:19:15.085 --> 02:19:15.966]  I'm sorry.
[02:19:15.966 --> 02:19:17.307]  I just... I'm so angry at these people.
[02:19:18.208 --> 02:19:25.815]  Well, it's just like Henry Kissinger talking Richard Nixon into giving the miniature ball bearing technology to Russia so they can merv their missiles.
[02:19:25.815 --> 02:19:30.440]  They didn't have independent warheads until we gave them the miniature ball bearing technology.
[02:19:30.440 --> 02:19:31.701]  And why do they do that?
[02:19:31.701 --> 02:19:34.624]  Because they are building the best enemies that money can buy.
[02:19:34.624 --> 02:19:35.645]  They want this war.
[02:19:35.645 --> 02:19:38.648]  They want this America attacked.
[02:19:39.608 --> 02:19:46.770]  They don't intend to lose the war, but they do intend to absorb a nuclear first spike, and Donald Trump needs to know that, unless he gets trapped into this.
[02:19:46.770 --> 02:19:57.874]  If he starts a war without understanding what's going to happen, I can tell you, he can authorize a nuclear retaliation, but I can tell you those codes aren't going to get to the... Stay there, I want to talk, some takes more calls, maybe keep you longer.
[02:19:57.874 --> 02:20:00.915]  I want to get into how this could trigger a larger war, how it happens.
[02:20:02.506 --> 02:20:03.047]  I don't think so.
[02:20:12.088 --> 02:20:16.311]  Surprise the little ones in your life with personalized Easter baskets from Personal Creations.

[02:24:56.030 --> 02:24:57.131]  All right, Joel Scouts is our guest.
[02:24:57.131 --> 02:24:58.311]  We're taking phone calls.
[02:24:58.311 --> 02:25:01.332]  I'm going to have him a little bit in the next segment with me as well.
[02:25:01.332 --> 02:25:08.255]  We'll take a few calls to talk about, and I've got all the scenarios here, and I've read about them and watched it, how easy a nuclear war can start.
[02:25:08.255 --> 02:25:10.656]  North Korea fires a missile, or the U.S.
[02:25:10.656 --> 02:25:14.138]  knows they're loading an atomic on it, or maybe, so they blow them up on the launch pad.
[02:25:14.938 --> 02:25:18.800]  Then the North starts attacking South Korea and a war starts.
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:22.962]  And then the military is going to say hit them with tactical nuclear weapons to stop them coming across.
[02:25:22.962 --> 02:25:25.603]  Or China may launch nukes.
[02:25:25.603 --> 02:25:27.804]  Or North Korea might then launch one on Seoul.
[02:25:27.804 --> 02:25:29.545]  I mean it just goes everywhere.
[02:25:29.545 --> 02:25:35.247]  And all some little crazy fat man who's just the image of a wimpy dictator.
[02:25:35.247 --> 02:25:36.608]  It's ridiculous.
[02:25:36.608 --> 02:25:38.729]  What a poster child for big government and communism.
[02:25:39.509 --> 02:25:40.571]  Let's go to John in New York.
[02:25:40.571 --> 02:25:41.572]  Another John.
[02:25:41.572 --> 02:25:44.797]  John, you're on the air with Joel Skousen, the editor at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:25:44.797 --> 02:25:45.057]  Go ahead.
[02:25:46.542 --> 02:25:49.423]  Alright Alex, first of all, thanks for everything you do.
[02:25:49.423 --> 02:25:55.545]  I wanted to say anyone who's more interested in evidence that the global elite have interest in turning over U.S.
[02:25:55.545 --> 02:26:04.828]  interests to China should look at WikiLeaks email number 23730 in which Clinton wants to discuss turning over Taiwan to China in order to curry favor with the Chinese.
[02:26:04.828 --> 02:26:08.569]  Now Taiwan, a lot of people don't know, was modeled after the U.S.
[02:26:08.569 --> 02:26:12.010]  It was the original government of China before it was kicked out by the Commies.
[02:26:12.782 --> 02:26:21.278]  So for Clinton to do that would basically turn over the entire South China Sea to Communist dictators.
[02:26:21.278 --> 02:26:23.502]  That's a great point, Joel Skousen.
[02:26:23.502 --> 02:26:24.944]  We're putting the WikiLeaks up there.
[02:26:26.291 --> 02:26:42.788]  Well, remember that the globalists have been doing this ever since the beginning, when they, in 1949, allowed Mao Zedong to take over China by cutting off military aid to Chiang Kai-shek, who fled, of course, to Formosa, which now has become Taiwan.
[02:26:43.328 --> 02:26:54.098]  So the globalists under Henry Kissinger gave away free China, let them be replaced at the United Nations with red China, even gave them a seat on the Security Council.
[02:26:54.098 --> 02:26:57.882]  This is part of the effort of building an enemy, a future enemy.
[02:26:57.882 --> 02:27:03.267]  It's not an indication that the globalists are in bed with China in a knowing relationship.
[02:27:03.267 --> 02:27:04.788]  It is a one-way street.
[02:27:04.788 --> 02:27:09.172]  It is globalists giving to China, China only playing as if the
[02:27:09.352 --> 02:27:15.178]  Sure, both sides are exploiting each other, and the West is exploiting all the slave labor in China.
[02:27:22.333 --> 02:27:26.556]  But it is not joint collaboration as if the globals own China or Russia.
[02:27:26.556 --> 02:27:28.718]  These are still separate predator powers.
[02:27:28.718 --> 02:27:38.465]  John, that's a great point you raised, though, that our so-called elites, Hillary, is just so ready to sell out whole regions, whole countries, whole systems to these people.
[02:27:38.465 --> 02:27:39.046]  It's sickening.
[02:27:39.046 --> 02:27:41.087]  Anything else, John?
[02:27:41.087 --> 02:27:48.593]  Well, I just want to say that the people of Taiwan, I go there frequently, and they love Trump because he's the first president to talk to the president of Taiwan in 30 years.
[02:27:48.593 --> 02:27:49.714]  We've got a lot of support over there.
[02:27:49.714 --> 02:27:50.735]  We can't let these people down.
[02:27:52.011 --> 02:27:53.092]  Well, I just know this.
[02:27:53.092 --> 02:28:00.838]  I mean, we have true communist evil in China expanding, and our media never says a word about it, but then wants to have war with Russia constantly.
[02:28:00.838 --> 02:28:01.578]  Let's take another call.
[02:28:01.578 --> 02:28:02.039]  Thank you, John.
[02:28:02.039 --> 02:28:04.721]  We're going to go to North Carolina now and talk to Chris.
[02:28:04.721 --> 02:28:06.783]  Chris in North Carolina, you're on the air with Joel Scouser.
[02:28:06.783 --> 02:28:07.043]  Go ahead.
[02:28:08.422 --> 02:28:11.705]  Thank you for taking my call, and thank you guys for all that you do.
[02:28:11.705 --> 02:28:15.529]  I know you don't like the thanks, but... I just don't want to die in a nuclear war.
[02:28:15.529 --> 02:28:16.290]  I want my kids to live.
[02:28:16.290 --> 02:28:16.811]  But yes, sir.
[02:28:16.811 --> 02:28:17.171]  Thank you.
[02:28:17.171 --> 02:28:18.192]  Thank you for what you do.
[02:28:18.192 --> 02:28:20.154]  Chris?
[02:28:20.154 --> 02:28:23.578]  I definitely believe it's going to come from North Korea.
[02:28:23.578 --> 02:28:28.062]  I mean, you can see it being set up plain as day.
[02:28:28.062 --> 02:28:30.044]  And I want to let you guys know that...
[02:28:31.305 --> 02:28:41.849]  I watched Strategic Relocation by Joel, I think it was about maybe two or three years ago, and I lived in a major city and I got the heck out of the city.
[02:28:41.849 --> 02:28:54.714]  Now I live in a rural area, and it's because of, I mean I always knew that something was coming, and I know it's coming a lot faster than what we probably expect.
[02:28:54.714 --> 02:29:00.056]  I was about to say, my instinct says get way away from populated centers, so that's a great point.
[02:29:01.767 --> 02:29:01.987]  I think?
[02:29:18.912 --> 02:29:22.233]  Um, I'll quickly say I'm a black male, first time voting.
[02:29:22.233 --> 02:29:25.175]  I mean, in my early 40s, I just voted for the first time.
[02:29:25.175 --> 02:29:29.376]  I voted for Trump because, um, I think he's got the right intentions.
[02:29:29.376 --> 02:29:33.898]  I think he knows what's going on, but I don't think he understands the total depth.
[02:29:35.359 --> 02:29:36.781]  Chris, it's good to have you on board.
[02:29:36.781 --> 02:29:37.401]  God bless you.
[02:29:37.401 --> 02:29:37.882]  We're out of time.
[02:29:37.882 --> 02:29:41.185]  I'm going to come back and get Joel's comment on your great points.
[02:29:41.185 --> 02:29:41.746]  Absolutely.
[02:29:41.746 --> 02:29:43.447]  That's why the globals hate Trump so much.
[02:29:43.447 --> 02:29:49.433]  We're going to come back with Joel's response, more calls, and then talk about how this war could be triggered, and then what would happen.
[02:29:49.433 --> 02:29:50.815]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.815 --> 02:29:53.357]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.357 --> 02:29:56.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.569 --> 02:30:07.134]  The United States is rapidly and dangerously moving towards a war with North Korea.
[02:30:07.134 --> 02:30:26.188]  Retired four-star General Jack King, who turned down President Donald Trump's offer to be Secretary of Defense, says a preemptive strike on North Korea's nuclear facilities might be the only option we have left to stop them from developing nuclear missiles capable of striking the U.S.
[02:30:26.188 --> 02:30:29.711]  White House National Security Advisor KT McFarland says
[02:30:30.131 --> 02:30:40.298]  If it fails to put pressure on North Korea to disable its nuclear program, there is a real possibility that North Korea will be able to hit the U.S.
[02:30:40.298 --> 02:30:45.481]  with a nuclear-armed missile by the end of Trump's first term as president.
[02:30:45.481 --> 02:30:52.506]  Meanwhile, China has vowed to defend its territory at all costs if the U.S.
[02:30:52.506 --> 02:30:56.228]  launches a military attack against North Korea.
[02:30:56.228 --> 02:30:58.730]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.

[02:32:00.373 --> 02:32:02.214]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:32:02.214 --> 02:32:08.816]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:32:08.816 --> 02:32:11.977]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[02:32:11.977 --> 02:32:21.760]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[02:32:21.760 --> 02:32:22.601]  Caveman.
[02:32:22.601 --> 02:32:27.662]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:32:27.662 --> 02:32:29.783]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:32:30.083 --> 02:32:33.224]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:32:33.224 --> 02:32:38.365]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:32:38.365 --> 02:32:46.507]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:32:46.507 --> 02:32:54.450]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:32:54.450 --> 02:32:59.111]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and forwardslife.com today.
[02:33:07.313 --> 02:33:12.319]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:12.319 --> 02:33:13.841]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:33:46.678 --> 02:33:50.223]  Alright, final segment with Joel Skousen taking a few phone calls here.
[02:33:50.223 --> 02:33:55.109]  But the last caller brought up why the elite hate Trump so much.
[02:33:57.219 --> 02:34:02.164]  Joel Skousen, in your gut, do you think they'll try to kill Trump or just try to wind up some crazy to do it?
[02:34:02.164 --> 02:34:04.626]  Hope all their anti-Trump hype does it.
[02:34:04.626 --> 02:34:08.650]  I mean, don't they endanger themselves turning him into a martyr?
[02:34:08.650 --> 02:34:15.836]  But then if you pull back, they're just already so panicked he's in the office that it seems like they're not worried about what might come.
[02:34:15.836 --> 02:34:18.679]  They just want that victory over the Nationalists now.
[02:34:20.273 --> 02:34:26.977]  Well, the danger they run in doing an assassination attempt always leaves a lot of trails, like the JFK assassination.
[02:34:26.977 --> 02:34:32.200]  It creates a tremendous body of evidence for conspiracy, and they're reluctant to do that.
[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:41.405]  I mean, 9-11 boosted the conspiracy community by 30 or 40 or 50 percent, just because of all the tracks government left in pulling off that false flag operation.
[02:34:41.405 --> 02:34:48.089]  So, I think that's doubtful, especially as they're being able to control him so successfully on foreign policy.
[02:34:48.869 --> 02:35:00.778]  I mean, as typical, you know, like happened yesterday when he came out railing against Assad, that means he bought into the chemical weapons attack, even though none of the mainstream media actually said it was proven that was Assad, because it can't be proven.
[02:35:00.778 --> 02:35:01.659]  It wasn't him.
[02:35:01.659 --> 02:35:03.000]  It was the rebels.
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:12.827]  So, I think they're going to, I think it's most likely they're going to try to continue to discredit him while they control him in foreign policy, so that he can't be re-elected.
[02:35:13.968 --> 02:35:27.724]  But talking about North Korea, I think there's a very real possibility that that scenario is true, that they will try to precipitate this strike before the end of the Trump administration so that they blame him on it.
[02:35:27.724 --> 02:35:28.344]  And that's why...
[02:35:28.865 --> 02:35:29.105]  That's right.
[02:35:47.708 --> 02:35:52.154]  Wants to be a Patriot, but then Rick Perry only became Mr. Tea Party when we made him.
[02:35:52.154 --> 02:35:57.682]  Rick Perry, Statesman is reporting, added to National Security Council's core decision makers.
[02:35:57.682 --> 02:36:02.609]  Rick Perry, former Texas Governor, added to the National Security Council.
[02:36:02.609 --> 02:36:04.592]  That is the most, that is cockamamie.
[02:36:06.775 --> 02:36:13.203]  I'm a little worried about that because Rick Perry has been an unstable voice for the conservative community.
[02:36:13.203 --> 02:36:18.811]  He's been all over the map and he has followed some globalist agendas when it came to that NAFTA corridor.
[02:36:18.811 --> 02:36:20.533]  And he's gone to Bilderberg?
[02:36:21.963 --> 02:36:23.144]  Yeah, he's gone to Bilderberg.
[02:36:23.144 --> 02:36:30.051]  So, look, anybody that McMaster allows to be on the National Security Council is going to be safe.
[02:36:30.051 --> 02:36:32.753]  I was about to say, that means, I see Perry as a lapdog.
[02:36:32.753 --> 02:36:33.874]  Former Democrat.
[02:36:33.874 --> 02:36:34.615]  He's just a yes man.
[02:36:34.615 --> 02:36:35.616]  I don't think he's a bad person.
[02:36:35.616 --> 02:36:36.697]  I know him.
[02:36:36.697 --> 02:36:38.839]  I think they put a lapdog on there.
[02:36:38.839 --> 02:36:40.521]  But he's not particularly smart either.
[02:36:41.778 --> 02:36:42.038]  I think?
[02:37:00.268 --> 02:37:02.969]  And there's going to be a tremendous amount of chaos and social unrest.
[02:37:02.969 --> 02:37:11.373]  People need to have alternatives for getting out of the big cities or retreats or arrangements with families who live in more rural areas.
[02:37:11.373 --> 02:37:14.514]  You know, Alex and I did a video on securing your home.
[02:37:14.514 --> 02:37:15.695]  It hasn't been released yet.
[02:37:15.695 --> 02:37:17.296]  It's going to be done shortly.
[02:37:17.296 --> 02:37:28.741]  But we're giving real prime information to all you people on how to develop inexpensively a fallout and safety shelter in your own home that can be done quite
[02:37:29.402 --> 02:37:33.433]  Economically, so you don't have to be held hostage by the threat of nuclear war.
[02:37:33.433 --> 02:37:35.017]  There's actually something that you can do.
[02:37:36.311 --> 02:37:41.292]  Wow, okay, I want to go to a few calls here in closing, but spend a few minutes on how the war could be triggered.
[02:37:41.292 --> 02:37:50.295]  There's three or four different scenarios I know, main scenarios, but you're a former Marine Corps officer, fighter-bomber pilot, guy that's predicted, really studied this particularly, this trigger for World War III.
[02:37:50.295 --> 02:38:02.779]  We can probably put on screen just a map of the Korean Peninsula, the South China Sea, but China projecting its power very belligerently, breaking deals it had with the Anglo-American establishment to be a dominant economic force but not military.
[02:38:02.779 --> 02:38:03.659]  They're breaking with that.
[02:38:04.119 --> 02:38:05.041]  Why are they breaking with it?
[02:38:05.041 --> 02:38:06.904]  And then let's talk about the triggers, how this would go.
[02:38:06.904 --> 02:38:11.091]  Because even mainstream news says this could easily escalate to nuclear war in a matter of minutes.
[02:38:12.412 --> 02:38:29.756]  Yes, the main principle from a military standpoint and what North Korea has prepared for for years is a mass invasion across the peninsula into the south and shelling of Seoul to which the United States military could only stop because it's 2 million men versus 50,000 men.
[02:38:29.756 --> 02:38:32.616]  You can only stop that with tactical nuclear weapons.
[02:38:32.616 --> 02:38:34.457]  That would trigger a nuclear war.
[02:38:34.457 --> 02:38:41.078]  But the more likely scenario now, Alex, is that Kim Jong-un makes good on his threat and launches a missile at Hawaii.
[02:38:41.898 --> 02:38:48.281]  Now that said, remember that Kim Jong-un does not have maneuvering warheads like the Chinese and the Russians.
[02:38:48.281 --> 02:38:52.142]  His missile would be easy to track, easy to shoot down, and U.S.
[02:38:52.142 --> 02:38:57.785]  naval vessels with the Aegis anti-missile system would easily shoot down the missile.
[02:38:57.785 --> 02:38:58.605]  It's a softball!
[02:38:59.517 --> 02:39:00.538]  That's right.
[02:39:00.538 --> 02:39:15.407]  So at that point when it's shot down, I don't care if it comes over the pole towards the East Coast, or I think they'll try for something in Hawaii, because remember, North Korea has never tested a nuclear weapon to a target where you get a circular error probable.
[02:39:15.407 --> 02:39:19.449]  They don't know how accurate their missiles are yet.
[02:39:19.449 --> 02:39:25.313]  But in any case, it's going to be shot down by the West, and then the West has a decision
[02:39:26.303 --> 02:39:32.548]  We really need to, they'll say, you know, take out their nuclear capacity because they've threatened us now.
[02:39:32.548 --> 02:39:34.790]  If they did, that could trigger nuclear war.
[02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:43.417]  If they did retaliate and take out their missile sites as well as their nuclear... And we've got the Secretary of State generals all saying the only option might be hitting the sites.
[02:39:43.417 --> 02:39:50.803]  They're going right to just annihilating the sites right now because Kim Jong-un is threatening to blow up Seoul and Tokyo.
[02:39:51.764 --> 02:39:53.364]  But I don't think that'll happen, Alex.
[02:39:53.364 --> 02:39:55.645]  I don't think they'll move first.
[02:39:55.645 --> 02:39:56.525]  I think the U.S.'
[02:39:56.505 --> 02:40:03.806]  's confidence in their ability to shoot down a missile, so they're going to wait to see if Kim Jong-un... The globalists don't want to appear to be the aggressors.
[02:40:03.806 --> 02:40:10.548]  They've got to appear the victims in this next war, and they can do so... Then why is North Korea exactly playing along with that?
[02:40:10.548 --> 02:40:19.110]  I get China wants a plausible deniability of the war happens, but that's a two-way street, and it seems like it cuts harder on the other side of them being the aggressor.
[02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:21.230]  Everybody knows that that's their pet.
[02:40:21.570 --> 02:40:25.851]  Pet, pet, pig, Kim Jong-un.
[02:40:25.851 --> 02:40:32.554]  Yeah, well he has whipped up his troops to a frenzy every year in speeches for them, telling them we're going to attack, that it's imminent.
[02:40:32.554 --> 02:40:34.254]  He's got to keep doing something.
[02:40:34.254 --> 02:40:35.895]  I mean, this guy is not stable.
[02:40:35.895 --> 02:40:37.975]  This guy is a juvenile mind.
[02:40:37.975 --> 02:40:38.536]  It's just incredible.
[02:40:38.536 --> 02:40:41.617]  Why don't their elite, I know China runs in North Korea, but how do they do that?
[02:40:41.617 --> 02:40:43.577]  I don't know, a lot of research goes into it.
[02:40:43.577 --> 02:40:47.218]  Why hasn't their elite killed him, reformed, merged with South Korea?
[02:40:47.218 --> 02:40:48.519]  Why do they want to be communist?
[02:40:49.687 --> 02:40:55.011]  Well, remember, they want Kim Jong-un to have a crazy man to start the war.
[02:40:55.011 --> 02:41:01.335]  I mean, China wants, needs someone to start the war so that they can't be blamed on it, so that Russia can't be blamed on it.
[02:41:01.335 --> 02:41:08.000]  They've got every motive in the world to keep Kim Jong-un and every other wire-headed kid in office if he should die.
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:12.723]  And China controls Kim Jong-un mostly through controlling the military.
[02:41:13.163 --> 02:41:15.284]  The military is controlled by Chinese generals.
[02:41:15.284 --> 02:41:18.325]  They don't make a move without consulting with Red China.
[02:41:18.325 --> 02:41:21.206]  So I think that situation is not going to change.
[02:41:21.206 --> 02:41:23.748]  But Kim Jong-un thinks he's in charge.
[02:41:23.748 --> 02:41:25.128]  That's what's dangerous.
[02:41:25.128 --> 02:41:28.350]  He can launch a missile and start a war.
[02:41:28.350 --> 02:41:31.811]  And, you know, he attacks South Korea at least once a year.
[02:41:31.811 --> 02:41:37.153]  Whether it's attacking a patrol board or shelling an island, that's all provocation.
[02:41:37.153 --> 02:41:39.494]  But I think things are heating up and they're getting serious.
[02:41:39.494 --> 02:41:40.875]  We need to watch this very closely.
[02:41:43.476 --> 02:41:49.459]  All right, well, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is going to be coming on soon to give us his take.
[02:41:49.459 --> 02:41:50.900]  I want to get him on about this.
[02:41:50.900 --> 02:41:54.562]  I also want to get Ron Paul, Dr. Ron Paul, on to cover all this.
[02:41:54.562 --> 02:41:56.563]  Joel Skousen, World Affairs Brief.
[02:41:56.563 --> 02:41:58.544]  I got a lot of other calls here, but I know you've got to go.
[02:41:58.544 --> 02:42:00.464]  And I've got Millie about to pop in, so we'll talk to you soon.
[02:42:00.464 --> 02:42:05.307]  I'll go to Sam and Jason and Bruce and Dan and Ken, everybody, after I finish talking to Millie.
[02:42:05.307 --> 02:42:07.188]  But thank you so much, Joel Skousen.
[02:42:08.158 --> 02:42:09.579]  Pleasure to be with you, Alex.
[02:42:09.579 --> 02:42:10.960]  Goodbye now.
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:11.600]  Thank you.
[02:42:11.600 --> 02:42:34.794]  I just have children, and the spectacle of that demon creature, Kim Jong-un, and then I watch the photos and videos of his minions, even the ones that are supposedly elite, and they are the most crazy-eyed, skinny, starving clowns in their ridiculous monkey suits.
[02:42:37.304 --> 02:42:45.028]  Feeding on people, but then I look at Pelosi and everybody, and I see how in a few generations from her, you'd have something even worse here.
[02:42:45.028 --> 02:42:49.651]  And then I ask, well then who am I?
[02:42:49.651 --> 02:42:53.993]  If I'm ruled by these lazy, hateful, evil people, I can't laugh at North Koreans.
[02:42:53.993 --> 02:42:56.115]  I certainly don't laugh, I cry for them.
[02:42:56.115 --> 02:43:00.257]  Man, I spent like 30 minutes this morning just looking at photos and videos of North Koreans.
[02:43:00.257 --> 02:43:03.599]  That's the stuff they let you see.
[02:43:03.599 --> 02:43:05.340]  It was a very haunting photo, I talked about it earlier.
[02:43:07.967 --> 02:43:09.048]  It's a CNN story.
[02:43:09.048 --> 02:43:16.313]  Yeah, it was Rex Tillerson's incredibly odd and confusing statement on North Korea.
[02:43:16.313 --> 02:43:25.661]  And it shows Kim Jong-un standing there with a tank crews.
[02:43:25.661 --> 02:43:33.627]  And when you blow it up and look at their faces, each one of their faces, I mean, they believe they're the good guys.
[02:43:35.461 --> 02:43:40.923]  They believe that there's this evil enemy that they're up against.
[02:43:40.923 --> 02:43:42.523]  They are on another planet, man.
[02:43:42.523 --> 02:43:45.184]  They are beyond any cult you've ever seen.
[02:43:45.184 --> 02:43:53.167]  And it's like... It's what Hollywood is, though.
[02:43:53.167 --> 02:43:56.128]  Where the media holds up this star or this person.
[02:43:56.128 --> 02:43:57.008]  They may be a great actor.
[02:43:57.008 --> 02:43:58.268]  They may be a really beautiful woman.
[02:43:58.268 --> 02:43:59.749]  A handsome man.
[02:43:59.749 --> 02:44:03.590]  But still it's sick to sit there and just praise them for the so-called position they're in.
[02:44:05.287 --> 02:44:11.389]  And then you look at that place where the celebrity is him.
[02:44:11.389 --> 02:44:14.510]  And fawning women rushing up like he's Elvis Presley.
[02:44:14.510 --> 02:44:19.091]  Just grabbing him and throwing themselves at him.
[02:44:19.091 --> 02:44:22.252]  And it's so sincere because they're in such a cult.
[02:44:22.252 --> 02:44:24.253]  And then he thinks Dennis Rodman's cool.
[02:44:26.144 --> 02:44:27.744]  Hadn't been cool in 20 years.
[02:44:27.744 --> 02:44:29.425]  And that's never was cool.
[02:44:29.425 --> 02:44:38.246]  And that's the only celebrity he can get to go watch a basketball game where he sits there on state-run TV and says, the great Dennis Rodman is here to hear me.
[02:44:38.246 --> 02:44:40.227]  And it's just like all a joke.
[02:44:40.227 --> 02:44:44.307]  The whole universe is around us.
[02:44:44.307 --> 02:44:45.908]  And so much possibility.
[02:44:45.908 --> 02:44:47.908]  Look how far humanity's already come.
[02:44:47.908 --> 02:44:53.429]  And I just think about what we're ruled by and it just makes me ask why?
[02:44:55.731 --> 02:45:01.034]  Because our weakness is what has allowed that type of weakness to be in charge of things.
[02:45:01.034 --> 02:45:19.706]  And then I think about Democrats celebrating nuclear war and rooting for North Korea and all their weird crap and just rooting the economy implode and just like... Why?
[02:45:19.706 --> 02:45:21.607]  Why?
[02:45:21.607 --> 02:45:22.848]  Why does it have to happen like that?
[02:45:24.801 --> 02:45:28.663]  And so we just gotta do better?
[02:45:28.663 --> 02:45:33.464]  But you look at the strange cult-like control they have in Communist China and Communist North Korea.
[02:45:33.464 --> 02:45:37.246]  And they're such hellholes.
[02:45:37.246 --> 02:45:46.569]  Why does every trendy push communism as some unrealized utopia, some dream?
[02:45:46.569 --> 02:45:50.591]  Look at these photos of the generals and just everyone else.
[02:45:54.232 --> 02:46:02.134]  It's just totally and completely ridiculous.
[02:46:02.134 --> 02:46:09.276]  Let's go to Millie Weavers with a quick pop report because they're just out there in California to do detailed reports on a lot of bombshell stuff.
[02:46:09.276 --> 02:46:16.199]  I don't want her to come on live on the show to distract from what her and Gavin and Michael Zimmerman and everybody are doing on the team.
[02:46:18.973 --> 02:46:24.765]  Millie, what's the latest information from California in our investigation of the elite's penchant for child trafficking?
[02:46:26.206 --> 02:46:27.967]  Well, hi Alex.
[02:46:27.967 --> 02:46:52.515]  So far today, this morning, we met with the founder of Children of the Night, Dr. Lois Lee, and it was actually pretty amazing because we went to their center and they actually had young girls and boys living there at the center in like little dorms and they had little, they had schools, they had all kinds of nice programs and things.
[02:46:53.095 --> 02:46:57.980]  So, we actually had some of these children give us a tour around the facility.
[02:46:57.980 --> 02:47:00.583]  So, that was actually a shock.
[02:47:00.583 --> 02:47:05.669]  You're actually now interfacing with children that have been trafficked?
[02:47:05.669 --> 02:47:09.573]  Yeah, I mean, these were, as far as I could see, maybe the youngest, 12-ish.
[02:47:12.756 --> 02:47:20.818]  I talked to Dr. Lois Lee and she said that she's rescued sexually exploited children as young as eight years old.
[02:47:20.818 --> 02:47:24.079]  So they do come pretty young.
[02:47:24.079 --> 02:47:34.561]  Sure, and that's because they're able to speak out by it, but a lot of times they just get killed in the even darker stuff, or they get so programmed by it that they just accept it and never speak out.
[02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:42.630]  Well, what it seems to be is like there's different elements, there's different vicinities of the trafficking.
[02:47:42.630 --> 02:47:50.481]  So what it seems to be is like the Children of the Night seems to work with kids that are on the street from poor families.
[02:47:51.182 --> 02:48:03.194]  Um, poor areas where their parents are into drugs and it's an abusive environment where they're being molested at home or raped at home by family members or by drug dealers so their mom can get drugs.
[02:48:03.194 --> 02:48:09.220]  And then they end up running off to the street and then they get picked up by these traffickers or pimps.
[02:48:09.700 --> 02:48:10.200]  We're good to go.
[02:48:28.789 --> 02:48:37.253]  But what we're finding is that the young children, the pedophile stuff, is very popular amongst the elite circle.
[02:48:37.253 --> 02:48:42.116]  And that's what is kind of interesting to see is that you're... Of course, the general public's not.
[02:48:42.116 --> 02:48:43.957]  It's very rare in the general public.
[02:48:43.957 --> 02:48:45.037]  It's just an elite taste.
[02:48:45.037 --> 02:48:45.858]  That's documented, yes.
[02:48:46.758 --> 02:48:47.499]  Yes.
[02:48:47.499 --> 02:49:06.497]  So that's what we're finding, and I don't want to give too much away, but we're speaking with somebody that has worked for various intelligence agencies and that has information that is regarding a travel club that is linked to thousands of children that have gone missing, majority of them from Native American reservations.
[02:49:07.037 --> 02:49:13.100]  So we're going to be coming out with that stuff too later on in our investigation, but I don't want to reveal too much.
[02:49:13.100 --> 02:49:13.600]  Exactly.
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:15.241]  Well, we know up in Canada that was the case.
[02:49:15.241 --> 02:49:16.701]  It's been confirmed where they were trafficking.
[02:49:16.701 --> 02:49:19.042]  Exactly.
[02:49:19.042 --> 02:49:20.063]  That's part of it.
[02:49:20.063 --> 02:49:29.207]  And it's linked to some of these travel clubs where we have serial killers and murderers that do this stuff on behalf of the travel club.
[02:49:29.207 --> 02:49:31.088]  And that's kind of where this ties in.
[02:49:31.972 --> 02:49:33.934]  To the dark web.
[02:49:33.934 --> 02:49:37.077]  And that's what we're on our way right now to go to.
[02:49:37.077 --> 02:49:43.944]  Sure, there's a lot of travel clubs that go to Haiti and that's one of their big things is sex terrorism and Dominican Republic pedophilia.
[02:49:43.944 --> 02:49:45.005]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:49:46.474 --> 02:49:46.995]  Exactly.
[02:49:46.995 --> 02:49:57.225]  So you do find the pedophilia amongst just your average day street kid, but it is a lot more prevalent amongst the elite circles.
[02:49:57.225 --> 02:50:09.738]  And that, I think, speaks volumes that we have these elite people in powerful positions that are actually more into hurting these little kids, whereas it's not as common, although it is, it definitely is
[02:50:09.838 --> 02:50:15.221]  Well sure, and I love how the media tries to act like this is even going on with the Catholic Church in Penn State.
[02:50:15.221 --> 02:50:17.363]  And you've got to ask yourself, why is MSM doing that?
[02:50:17.363 --> 02:50:21.565]  Because they're sexualizing children, Viacom's famous for it.
[02:50:21.565 --> 02:50:23.126]  They are trying to normalize this.
[02:50:23.126 --> 02:50:24.047]  They want our children.
[02:50:24.047 --> 02:50:25.828]  This is what the elite want.
[02:50:25.828 --> 02:50:27.349]  And because it's evil.
[02:50:27.349 --> 02:50:31.492]  If they can get us to sexualize our children, we'll accept anything.
[02:50:32.737 --> 02:50:39.681]  Yes, and some of these stories are absolutely disturbing and they make you just sick to your stomach.
[02:50:39.681 --> 02:50:46.125]  I mean, what's going on on the deep web right now is pretty, I mean, it's pretty gruesome.
[02:50:46.125 --> 02:50:48.747]  Well, I've told you, I don't expect you guys to look at any of this.
[02:50:48.747 --> 02:50:50.067]  I know law enforcement's there and everything.
[02:50:50.067 --> 02:50:51.388]  We're not going to be watching this.
[02:50:51.388 --> 02:50:57.031]  No, I know law enforcement's all authorized it, but I just, I don't want to tell employees that, I mean, I know you don't even want to.
[02:50:57.031 --> 02:50:57.912]  Just do not look at it.
[02:50:57.912 --> 02:50:58.472]  We'll be back.
[02:50:58.472 --> 02:50:59.513]  I'm going to talk to you some more.
[02:51:00.276 --> 02:51:03.719]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs.
[02:51:03.719 --> 02:51:07.062]  So you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[02:51:07.062 --> 02:51:11.325]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey Purified Water.

[02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:31.601]  Maybe not today.
[02:51:31.601 --> 02:51:32.882]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:51:32.882 --> 02:51:36.625]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:51:36.625 --> 02:51:37.706]  Forget bunkers.
[02:51:37.706 --> 02:51:39.527]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[02:51:39.527 --> 02:51:41.249]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[02:52:59.645 --> 02:53:10.510]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:53:10.510 --> 02:53:14.672]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:53:14.672 --> 02:53:16.813]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:53:16.813 --> 02:53:22.255]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:53:22.435 --> 02:53:32.420]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:53:32.420 --> 02:53:38.883]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:53:38.883 --> 02:53:42.225]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:53:42.225 --> 02:53:44.266]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:53:44.266 --> 02:53:47.227]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:53:47.347 --> 02:53:49.368]  There's a man coming around taking names.
[02:53:49.368 --> 02:53:52.409]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[02:53:52.409 --> 02:53:54.430]  There's a man going around taking names.
[02:54:15.544 --> 02:54:21.146]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[02:54:21.146 --> 02:54:25.808]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[02:54:25.808 --> 02:54:28.830]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[02:54:28.830 --> 02:54:32.031]  When the man comes around.
[02:54:32.031 --> 02:54:33.572]  When the man comes around.
[02:54:33.572 --> 02:54:35.212]  Folks, we've got Johnny Cash bringing us home.
[02:54:35.212 --> 02:54:36.473]  I'm about to go back to Millie Weaver.
[02:54:36.473 --> 02:54:37.713]  I'm gonna let her get out of here in a minute.
[02:54:37.713 --> 02:54:41.315]  I'm gonna go talk to Roger Stone with breaking news about Bannon and so much more.
[02:54:43.410 --> 02:54:47.696]  I want to thank Lizards for supporting us, spreading the article, spreading the videos.
[02:54:47.696 --> 02:54:49.358]  They've tried to create their artificial internet.
[02:54:49.358 --> 02:54:49.738]  Googled.
[02:54:50.973 --> 02:54:53.493]  Facebook, Twitter to kill our free speech.
[02:54:53.493 --> 02:54:57.234]  And there's going to be antitrust deals coming up in Congress.
[02:54:57.234 --> 02:54:58.374]  They're going to get defeated again.
[02:54:58.374 --> 02:54:59.494]  This is not China.
[02:54:59.494 --> 02:55:01.995]  They're not going to just kill our free speech so easily.
[02:55:01.995 --> 02:55:07.276]  But it is important to know we have really great products everybody needs that have changed my life and changed so many other people's lives.
[02:55:07.276 --> 02:55:11.737]  The nutraceuticals, the supplements, the books, the films, all of it's about changing the world.
[02:55:11.737 --> 02:55:18.598]  We've got more of the children's fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and iodine in right now, but in bubblegum flavor.
[02:55:18.598 --> 02:55:19.458]  The adults sold out.
[02:55:20.523 --> 02:55:22.144]  So be sure and try that out.
[02:55:22.144 --> 02:55:28.868]  And for the first time in four years, we're facing a major deep earth iodine, the clean crystal form of it.
[02:55:28.868 --> 02:55:31.509]  So we're about to produce what could be our last run of it.
[02:55:31.509 --> 02:55:39.714]  We're going to probably sell out today, at least for a few days until more gets in, of the iodine.
[02:55:39.714 --> 02:55:40.934]  Here's some of the reviews.
[02:55:40.934 --> 02:55:43.876]  This is Gabriel from an undisclosed location.
[02:55:43.876 --> 02:55:45.317]  Why did I wait so long to try it?
[02:55:46.519 --> 02:55:49.441]  Best product that I've purchased from Full Horse so far.
[02:55:49.441 --> 02:55:53.865]  I've been taking Survival Shield X2 for three weeks now and I love it.
[02:55:53.865 --> 02:55:55.706]  I wish I would've tried it sooner.
[02:55:55.706 --> 02:56:01.070]  My energy levels are up and my whole body feels like operating efficiently and clean.
[02:56:01.070 --> 02:56:04.633]  So many people have major deficiencies and you'll die if you don't have it.
[02:56:04.633 --> 02:56:05.894]  I'm smarter since taking this.
[02:56:05.894 --> 02:56:08.636]  That's Flo Anderson in Denver, Colorado.
[02:56:08.636 --> 02:56:10.678]  Wow, noticeable difference in my brain.
[02:56:10.678 --> 02:56:14.301]  I'm remembering things I couldn't before and making connections.
[02:56:15.208 --> 02:56:17.009]  Okay, Millie, well, I just want to commend your courage.
[02:56:45.018 --> 02:56:51.742]  And the rest of the crew is encouraged because this is one of the areas where I actually am a wimp.
[02:56:51.742 --> 02:56:52.922]  I've investigated it.
[02:56:52.922 --> 02:56:54.403]  I've talked to police.
[02:56:54.403 --> 02:56:56.664]  I've seen the articles.
[02:56:56.664 --> 02:56:58.205]  It gets under my skin.
[02:56:58.205 --> 02:57:00.086]  And it makes me angry on a primitive level.
[02:57:00.086 --> 02:57:02.167]  So I know it's probably rough for you guys.
[02:57:02.167 --> 02:57:07.210]  What is it like being out there, meeting with law enforcement, going to these orphanages, seeing the facts for yourself?
[02:57:07.210 --> 02:57:07.650]  What's it like?
[02:57:09.246 --> 02:57:10.606]  Well, it's pretty sad.
[02:57:10.606 --> 02:57:12.007]  It's pretty heartbreaking.
[02:57:12.007 --> 02:57:18.208]  Definitely when I went and saw all those young kids there, it was like, wow, you know, I can't believe.
[02:57:18.208 --> 02:57:26.070]  It's just crazy to see faces, you know, to actually see the people that are being affected by this, the children that are being affected by this.
[02:57:26.070 --> 02:57:29.791]  And so that, to me, was like really shocking because I wasn't really prepared for that.
[02:57:30.566 --> 02:57:40.748]  But, um, you know, some of the stories even that we've been hearing having to investigate this about the dark web are pretty, you know, they're pretty like, they make you, they make your stomach just feel sick.
[02:57:40.748 --> 02:57:44.869]  They make you just want to like, ugh, I don't even know how to explain it.
[02:57:44.869 --> 02:57:49.671]  It just completely makes you sick to your stomach to hear some of this stuff that's going on out there.
[02:57:49.671 --> 02:57:55.272]  What makes me even sicker is then to see media making jokes about it or Salon pushing pedophilia.
[02:57:57.051 --> 02:58:05.995]  Yeah, I mean, that too, how you've had these groups like that Birkhead group, where they're saying they're virtuous pedophiles.
[02:58:05.995 --> 02:58:11.998]  And at the same time, it's like, well, I don't really see... I mean, I know they're saying they're not going out and committing the crimes.
[02:58:11.998 --> 02:58:21.203]  Well, we don't know if that's necessarily true, but at the same time, if somebody is saying they're a virtuous pedophile, I don't think that they should be trusted around children or have
[02:58:22.136 --> 02:58:30.341]  Those rights to be a school teacher or any type of a sort of figure around children because that means that there's a risk associated.
[02:58:30.341 --> 02:58:34.184]  All right, Millie, we're praying for you, Gavin, and of course Zimmerman.
[02:58:34.184 --> 02:58:34.784]  Great job.
[02:58:34.784 --> 02:58:35.905]  We'll talk to you again tomorrow.
[02:58:35.905 --> 02:58:38.007]  Big reports when you get back in HD.
[02:58:38.007 --> 02:58:39.227]  Real groundbreaking stuff.
[02:58:39.227 --> 02:58:40.048]  4th Hour straight ahead.
[02:58:40.048 --> 02:58:40.688]  Spread the link.
[02:58:40.688 --> 02:58:42.910]  They're trying to censor us.
[02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:43.570]  Don't let them win.
[02:58:43.570 --> 02:58:46.872]  4th Hour, Roger Stone and myself.
[02:58:46.872 --> 02:58:47.613]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:47.613 --> 02:58:48.153]  4th Life Show.
[02:58:48.153 --> 02:58:49.074]  Spread that link, please.
[02:58:50.558 --> 02:58:58.543]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[02:58:58.543 --> 02:59:05.187]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[02:59:05.187 --> 02:59:13.472]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[02:59:13.752 --> 02:59:19.616]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[02:59:19.616 --> 02:59:22.779]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[02:59:22.779 --> 02:59:28.523]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[02:59:28.863 --> 02:59:29.624]  It works!
[02:59:29.624 --> 02:59:38.069]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[02:59:38.069 --> 02:59:47.835]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[02:59:47.835 --> 02:59:52.999]  A total 360 win!
[02:59:52.999 --> 02:59:55.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:09.998 --> 03:00:15.223]  From an undisclosed location, Roger Stone rides out of the high desert mountains.
[03:00:15.223 --> 03:00:21.949]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:21.949 --> 03:00:26.933]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:00:26.933 --> 03:00:28.995]  What an epic time to be alive.
[03:00:28.995 --> 03:00:32.558]  Alright, Roger, I'm not going to hog in on the time today when you're about to host this fourth hour.
[03:00:32.558 --> 03:00:34.479]  I know you always have a lot to cover, but wow!
[03:00:36.793 --> 03:00:39.255]  I probably got to 30 news articles, probably another 200.
[03:00:39.255 --> 03:00:41.056]  I mean, it is all just insane.
[03:00:42.102 --> 03:00:43.003]  What's going on?
[03:00:43.003 --> 03:00:58.138]  The EU, the Communist Chinese threatening war, the Spanish ships coming into British waters over them, leaving the EU threatening, the Japanese, the Brits on our side, the Russians wanting to help us, wanting to defeat the globalists.
[03:00:58.138 --> 03:00:59.839]  I mean, it's just, imagine.
[03:00:59.839 --> 03:01:00.800]  That's why they're so scared.
[03:01:00.800 --> 03:01:06.085]  By accusing Trump of being a Russian agent, even though it's all come out as lies, it ends us having a good relationship with Russia.
[03:01:06.963 --> 03:01:10.885]  Which, we need, just from an economic perspective, it's another nationalist country.
[03:01:10.885 --> 03:01:13.205]  It's got way more resources than we do.
[03:01:13.205 --> 03:01:15.566]  We should be absolutely working with Russia.
[03:01:15.566 --> 03:01:18.708]  And then they say I'm a Russian agent, because I say that.
[03:01:18.708 --> 03:01:19.968]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[03:01:19.968 --> 03:01:20.868]  What's coming up?
[03:01:20.868 --> 03:01:22.189]  What's coming up in the next hour, my friend?
[03:01:22.651 --> 03:01:24.073]  No, you're exactly right, Alex.
[03:01:24.073 --> 03:01:25.754]  This is the new McCarthyism.
[03:01:25.754 --> 03:01:33.342]  If you're not for nuclear war with the Russians over Syria, well then you must be a traitor to the country of your birth.
[03:01:33.342 --> 03:01:34.764]  It's outrageous.
[03:01:34.764 --> 03:01:37.286]  It's particularly insulting for me, Alex, because
[03:01:38.887 --> 03:01:41.128]  My mother's people are Hungarian.
[03:01:41.128 --> 03:01:45.610]  My mother's people were crushed on the streets of Budapest in 1956.
[03:01:45.610 --> 03:01:49.672]  So don't tell me about Russians.
[03:01:49.672 --> 03:01:50.833]  You're exactly right.
[03:01:50.833 --> 03:01:52.574]  It's hard to keep up with the news.
[03:01:52.574 --> 03:01:58.516]  That picture you showed of the North Korean tyrant with his generals.
[03:01:58.516 --> 03:02:01.017]  Look carefully at the pictures of those generals.
[03:02:01.017 --> 03:02:04.139]  Notice how all their sleeves are too long.
[03:02:04.139 --> 03:02:06.340]  That's the worst tailoring I've ever seen.
[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:14.962]  We are at the brink, clearly, of a national, or I should say an international upheaval.
[03:02:14.962 --> 03:02:15.802]  That's a good point, though.
[03:02:15.802 --> 03:02:17.982]  Communists can't even produce clothes.
[03:02:17.982 --> 03:02:19.703]  I could make a better suit than that.
[03:02:19.703 --> 03:02:22.363]  Yeah, no, their sleeves are always too long.
[03:02:22.363 --> 03:02:25.104]  It is a sign of Chinese tailoring.
[03:02:25.104 --> 03:02:30.425]  They must be sending to China to have their uniforms made wholesale.
[03:02:30.425 --> 03:02:34.846]  Here's, I think, the real point, which is, very much like Ronald Reagan,
[03:02:35.686 --> 03:02:41.848]  The North Koreans, the Chinese are about to find out that Donald Trump is not a cream puff.
[03:02:41.848 --> 03:02:48.269]  He is not a pushover like Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton or Barack Obama.
[03:02:48.269 --> 03:02:54.191]  He's tough as nails, perhaps the toughest man I've ever met.
[03:02:54.191 --> 03:03:01.773]  And there is ice water in his veins when he is on the attack and he's standing up for something he believes in.
[03:03:02.433 --> 03:03:11.620]  So, they're about to confront an international leader who's unlike anyone they've ever dealt with before.
[03:03:11.620 --> 03:03:20.606]  The ass-kissing and the appeasement of our international foes, those days are over, my friend.
[03:03:20.606 --> 03:03:22.628]  And that's why all the special interests are so mad.
[03:03:22.628 --> 03:03:29.953]  They're saying Trump's the pushover and controlled by foreigners because he's the only president in forever that actually isn't controlled by foreigners.
[03:03:30.333 --> 03:03:41.400]  Well, in big news today, carried by Real Clear Politics, Congressman Adam Schiff of California now admits that there is no evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:43.061]  It's about time.
[03:03:43.061 --> 03:03:49.465]  He has made specific accusations about me that, you know, I am itching to respond to.
[03:03:49.465 --> 03:03:51.267]  And so the House of Cards is coming down.
[03:03:51.267 --> 03:03:53.748]  They now admit Susan Rice did illegally spy.
[03:03:53.748 --> 03:03:54.609]  Other people did it.
[03:03:54.609 --> 03:03:57.591]  I mean, as you said a month ago, or more, this is the new Watergate.
[03:03:58.331 --> 03:04:05.035]  Well, and the left has said repeatedly, somebody's going to go to jail, somebody's going to go to jail in this whole Russia thing.
[03:04:05.035 --> 03:04:06.456]  They're absolutely right.
[03:04:06.456 --> 03:04:22.445]  Some people are going to go to jail, but they're the front line of Barack Obama's advisers and retainers, who clearly were utilizing national surveillance information, intel information, for strictly political purposes.
[03:04:22.445 --> 03:04:24.987]  And that's a big no-no, as you know.
[03:04:25.973 --> 03:04:28.955]  Well, what else is coming up as I turn the baton over to you, my friend?
[03:04:28.955 --> 03:04:35.761]  Well, I want to talk about Steve Bannon and the shift of power, the internal struggle in the White House.
[03:04:35.761 --> 03:04:44.588]  As you know, we foreshadowed all of this yesterday with our discussion of Jared Kushner's text message channel to Joe Scarborough.
[03:04:44.588 --> 03:04:47.010]  So we're going to get back into that in just a few minutes.
[03:04:47.270 --> 03:04:49.473]  And by the way, our interview yesterday is big news.
[03:04:49.473 --> 03:04:51.135]  That's in hundreds of newspapers.
[03:04:51.135 --> 03:04:53.038]  And Roger Stone is about to make a lot more news.
[03:04:53.038 --> 03:04:59.026]  He's got more details on that whole Kusher situation with the folks over in Scarborough country.
[03:05:00.267 --> 03:05:01.228]  Tensions are high.
[03:05:01.228 --> 03:05:04.431]  Border wall contractors race for a hostile environment.
[03:05:04.431 --> 03:05:11.617]  One potential bidder on President Donald Trump's border wall wanted to know if authorities would rush to help if workers came under hostile attack.
[03:05:11.617 --> 03:05:19.604]  Another asked if employees can carry firearms in states with strict gun control laws and if the government would indemnify them for using deadly force.
[03:05:19.804 --> 03:05:27.315]  With bids due Tuesday on the first design contracts, interesting companies are preparing for the worst if they get the potentially lucrative job.
[03:05:27.315 --> 03:05:27.675]  A U.S.
[03:05:27.675 --> 03:05:35.366]  official with knowledge of the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity said four to ten bidders are expected to be chosen to build prototypes.
[03:05:35.546 --> 03:05:43.191]  They will be constructed on a roughly quarter-mile, 400-meter strip of federally owned land in San Diego within 120 feet of the border.
[03:05:43.191 --> 03:05:54.019]  Though a final decision has not been made on the precise spot, Democrats vow to oppose any wall funding, and many Republicans are also wary of this plan for a massive brick and mortar barrier.
[03:05:54.019 --> 03:05:58.662]  You can find more reports as we try to build the wall at InfoWars.com.
[03:05:59.957 --> 03:06:03.362]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:06:03.362 --> 03:06:04.523]  They lost.
[03:06:04.523 --> 03:06:05.064]  We won.
[03:06:05.064 --> 03:06:11.192]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[03:06:11.192 --> 03:06:15.118]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[03:06:15.862 --> 03:06:21.589]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[03:06:21.589 --> 03:06:34.143]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie, God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[03:06:34.143 --> 03:06:36.606]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[03:06:36.846 --> 03:06:38.027]  We're the solution!
[03:06:38.027 --> 03:06:39.028]  Americans!
[03:06:39.028 --> 03:06:40.550]  Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[03:06:40.550 --> 03:06:45.935]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[03:06:45.935 --> 03:06:47.576]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[03:06:47.576 --> 03:06:49.498]  DVDs now available.
[03:06:49.498 --> 03:06:52.962]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[03:06:52.962 --> 03:06:55.724]  Americans need to see this film.
[03:06:55.724 --> 03:06:56.685]  Revelation.
[03:06:56.685 --> 03:06:57.246]  The Movie.
[03:06:57.246 --> 03:06:59.308]  .info Let's fix it.
[03:07:01.049 --> 03:07:06.533]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:07:06.533 --> 03:07:07.394]  I take this.
[03:07:07.394 --> 03:07:08.514]  My family takes this.
[03:07:08.514 --> 03:07:12.818]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:07:12.818 --> 03:07:17.241]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:07:17.401 --> 03:07:22.043]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:07:22.043 --> 03:07:23.163]  I don't feel good.
[03:07:23.163 --> 03:07:26.684]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:07:26.684 --> 03:07:29.625]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:07:29.625 --> 03:07:35.407]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:07:35.407 --> 03:07:38.368]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:07:38.368 --> 03:07:41.909]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[03:07:41.909 --> 03:07:44.150]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.510]  I love it.
[03:07:44.670 --> 03:07:47.472]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:07:47.472 --> 03:07:48.473]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:07:48.473 --> 03:07:54.297]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:07:54.297 --> 03:07:56.318]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:07:56.318 --> 03:07:58.340]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[03:08:09.488 --> 03:08:14.645]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:08:21.254 --> 03:08:23.656]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:08:23.656 --> 03:08:31.222]  This is Roger Stone sitting in for my friend Alex Jones and damn glad to be with you.
[03:08:31.222 --> 03:08:40.129]  Some very good news from my granddaughter Caitlin who tells me that she has just read online that the super blue fluoride toothpaste
[03:08:40.689 --> 03:08:40.829]  That's
[03:08:56.372 --> 03:08:56.452]  It's
[03:09:14.855 --> 03:09:23.838]  If you've ever seen a photograph of Mrs. Stones, you know she has a gleaming white smile, and she swears by this product.
[03:09:23.838 --> 03:09:39.303]  So, if you want to support the fight for freedom, and if you want to keep the voice here at InfoWars strong, and if you want to gird us for the battle with Google and Facebook and those who would cut off our oxygen,
[03:09:40.023 --> 03:09:51.631]  Please, do yourself a favor, go to the InfoWars.com store and load up on the Super Blue Fluoride Toothpaste, now available in bubblegum flavor.
[03:09:51.631 --> 03:09:53.772]  This is a terrific product.
[03:09:53.772 --> 03:10:02.478]  The folks at InfoWars know I won't plug anything that I don't believe in, and the folks in my family swear by this product.
[03:10:03.678 --> 03:10:24.828]  Yesterday, here on InfoWars.com, we revealed a back-channel by text between the President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and the rabid anti-Trump television commentator and former congressman, Joe Scarborough.
[03:10:24.828 --> 03:10:29.491]  And my sources tell me that a number of the negative attacks
[03:10:30.171 --> 03:10:30.331]  I think?
[03:10:49.634 --> 03:10:51.295]  That is divided.
[03:10:51.295 --> 03:11:00.422]  A White House staff that is not entirely focused on the President's agenda and how to move it forward will ultimately fail.
[03:11:00.422 --> 03:11:03.724]  We have seen this in previous administrations.
[03:11:04.945 --> 03:11:10.769]  And in this particular case, I have no personal animus towards Jared Kushner.
[03:11:10.769 --> 03:11:13.551]  I think he's a very, very smart guy.
[03:11:13.551 --> 03:11:19.094]  I think he did a good job of helping his father-in-law win the presidency.
[03:11:19.094 --> 03:11:24.698]  But I disagree with the, I guess it was Forbes magazine cover that said, this is the man
[03:11:25.458 --> 03:11:26.780]  Who elected Donald Trump?
[03:11:26.780 --> 03:11:31.186]  No, Donald Trump is the man who elected Donald Trump.
[03:11:31.186 --> 03:11:35.592]  There is no Karl Rove like figure in Trump world.
[03:11:35.592 --> 03:11:36.654]  There never has been.
[03:11:36.654 --> 03:11:40.799]  It is most certainly not Roger Stone nor is it Jared Kushner.
[03:11:41.440 --> 03:12:02.880]  The man with the courage, the man with the foresight, the man who understood viscerally how angry the American people were and are about the two-party duopoly and the political establishment that is taking this country down the drain in his acquiescence to the globalists.
[03:12:04.081 --> 03:12:12.647]  They had certain vulnerabilities, certain saturation point that the American people had reached.
[03:12:12.647 --> 03:12:14.188]  Only Donald Trump saw this.
[03:12:14.188 --> 03:12:19.912]  The other 15 career politicians who opposed him for the nomination
[03:12:20.732 --> 03:12:25.758]  They did not see this tsunami coming.
[03:12:25.758 --> 03:12:27.680]  Only Donald Trump did.
[03:12:27.680 --> 03:12:38.412]  In any event, we have, again, proven to be correct here at InfoWars.com, predicting this White House contra-attempt.
[03:12:38.412 --> 03:12:41.435]  And while Mr. Kushner has much on his plate,
[03:12:42.222 --> 03:12:46.903]  The China visit, the entire question of Middle Eastern peace.
[03:12:46.903 --> 03:13:06.827]  I fear that he does not understand either the InfoWars, Breitbart, Daily Caller, Tea Party, Liberty-based coalition that elected Donald Trump, nor do I think he understands the looming threat
[03:13:07.952 --> 03:13:23.485]  By Google and Facebook and others who are actively seeking to choke off our oxygen and end broadcasts, or at least the reach of them, like the one you're watching right now.
[03:13:24.466 --> 03:13:26.648]  This is very real.
[03:13:26.648 --> 03:13:43.018]  I can tell you just by an examination of the analytics of StoneColdTruth.com, where I recommend that you visit, to keep up with my political commentary, but they have a stranglehold on our logarithms.
[03:13:43.018 --> 03:13:45.480]  They are monkeying with them.
[03:13:45.480 --> 03:13:53.746]  The number of people we are reaching, the number of people who are retweeting, is being dwarfed compared to just a couple months ago.
[03:13:54.826 --> 03:14:12.494]  In the closing days of the presidential campaign, there were days that InfoWars.com had 15, 18, 20 million viewers on all platforms, including Facebook Live, YouTube Live, of course the InfoWars site.
[03:14:12.494 --> 03:14:18.097]  And now they are seeking to ratchet down our reach.
[03:14:18.097 --> 03:14:22.859]  Now if there's anyone who understands this, it has to be Stephen K. Bannon.
[03:14:23.752 --> 03:14:33.778]  Mr. Bannon is formally at the helm of Breitbart News, vigorous, I would say robust investigative journalism.
[03:14:33.778 --> 03:14:36.699]  No, it is not an anti-Semitic site.
[03:14:36.699 --> 03:14:39.641]  No, it is not a bigoted site.
[03:14:39.641 --> 03:14:42.142]  No, they are not Klansmen.
[03:14:42.142 --> 03:14:44.224]  Those are the lies of David Brock.
[03:14:45.024 --> 03:14:48.588]  Uh, and his posse of misfits.
[03:14:48.588 --> 03:14:52.572]  They are the harbinger of the Trump victory.
[03:14:52.572 --> 03:15:00.380]  They are like Infowars.com, like Daily Caller, like Town Hall, like so many other fine sites.
[03:15:00.380 --> 03:15:01.981]  They're dedicated to the truth.
[03:15:03.262 --> 03:15:15.612]  And it is essential that Steve Bannon, or others within the Trump White House, make sure the President understands that this is an assault on his people.
[03:15:15.612 --> 03:15:18.073]  This is an assault on his voters.
[03:15:18.934 --> 03:15:37.279]  There is zero chance that the president can get re-elected in 2020 if he chooses to run with this kind of subterfuge, this kind of subversion of what is now one of the major channels for communications in this country.
[03:15:38.493 --> 03:15:41.334]  Broadcast television is over, folks.
[03:15:41.334 --> 03:15:44.316]  The number of people watching is dwindling.
[03:15:44.316 --> 03:15:51.059]  The number of people who are skeptical about what they see being true is soaring.
[03:15:51.059 --> 03:15:56.081]  This is also happening to cable news, CNN, Fox.
[03:15:56.081 --> 03:15:57.942]  They're in eclipse.
[03:15:57.942 --> 03:16:00.884]  They're being surpassed by net-based media.
[03:16:02.124 --> 03:16:24.709]  And that is why it is vitally important that the Trump administration examine the options for antitrust actions against Google, against the Silicon Valley crowd, that now seem to be making their way to New York to wine and dine Jared Kushner.
[03:16:25.712 --> 03:16:27.293]  And Ivanka Trump.
[03:16:27.293 --> 03:16:33.198]  Now, I am perhaps the world's largest fan of Ivanka Trump.
[03:16:33.198 --> 03:16:35.759]  She's an amazing woman.
[03:16:35.759 --> 03:16:42.604]  Highly intelligent, very articulate, very decent, very kind, very approachable.
[03:16:42.604 --> 03:16:54.073]  And somehow she balances being a key advisor to her father, running her own lines of business, which she has now left, being a mother, being a wife,
[03:16:54.713 --> 03:17:01.975]  Being physically fit, being impeccably dressed, how she balances all these roles, I don't know.
[03:17:01.975 --> 03:17:05.135]  But there is no criticism implied.
[03:17:05.135 --> 03:17:11.597]  The crowd around Google had their way in the Obama White House.
[03:17:11.597 --> 03:17:22.039]  The reporting of Dr. Jerry Corsi here at Infowars.com have covered this issue perhaps better than anyone in the mainstream media or anyone else.
[03:17:22.819 --> 03:17:28.765]  In alternative media, this is a lynching that is planned.
[03:17:28.765 --> 03:17:31.608]  This is an effort to choke off our oxygen.
[03:17:31.608 --> 03:17:35.593]  And the idea that Google would let people like David Brock
[03:17:36.932 --> 03:17:42.996]  You know, who is a left-wing hitman and a discredited one at that.
[03:17:42.996 --> 03:17:51.742]  And Snopes, for example, Snopes.com, make decisions as to what is and is not fake news.
[03:17:51.742 --> 03:17:55.404]  This is an incredible violation of our First Amendment rights.
[03:17:55.404 --> 03:18:00.788]  This is the end of free speech as we know it in this country.
[03:18:00.788 --> 03:18:06.072]  It may be the single most important element in terms of the long-term success
[03:18:06.932 --> 03:18:13.178]  Of Donald Trump's presidency and whether or not he can make America great again.
[03:18:13.178 --> 03:18:18.924]  So we are hopeful that Steve Bannon will put these issues in front of the president.
[03:18:18.924 --> 03:18:22.467]  We are hopeful that the boarding party from Google
[03:18:23.288 --> 03:18:32.438]  That even today is attempting to insert a stooge as head of the FTC in the Trump administration.
[03:18:32.438 --> 03:18:38.465]  We're hopeful that all of their motives and shenanigans will be exposed.
[03:18:39.766 --> 03:18:43.770]  I thank you for welcoming us here on InfoWars.
[03:18:43.770 --> 03:18:46.573]  We have so much more to talk about.
[03:18:46.573 --> 03:18:53.119]  The retreat of Adam Schiff, the congressman from California who thought he was going to go to the U.S.
[03:18:53.119 --> 03:18:54.441]  Senate over my dead body.
[03:18:55.381 --> 03:18:57.163]  He's got another thing coming.
[03:18:57.163 --> 03:19:09.591]  He's now, according to RealClearPolitics, in full retreat, admitting that there is no hard evidence, at least not yet, of any Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.
[03:19:09.591 --> 03:19:18.737]  Something I have been saying now for numerous months to the derision of the fake news media like the Daily Beast.
[03:19:19.537 --> 03:19:38.732]  So, this is very much Russiagate, is something we're going to visit a little later on in the program, because the false attacks of Schiff and Senator Adam Warner and, pardon me, Senator Mark Warner and others, simply must be addressed.
[03:19:38.732 --> 03:19:42.095]  Thanks for joining us here at Infowars.com, and I'll be right back.
[03:20:00.151 --> 03:20:02.533]  They say you can't take on the man and win.
[03:20:02.533 --> 03:20:07.578]  That one small company doesn't stand a chance against the corporate behemoths with all their money and lawyers.
[03:20:07.578 --> 03:20:09.601]  But they don't know Harry's.
[03:20:09.601 --> 03:20:10.922]  How's Harry's done it?
[03:20:10.922 --> 03:20:11.683]  Simple.
[03:20:11.683 --> 03:20:14.646]  By owning the factory and selling directly to you.
[03:20:14.646 --> 03:20:17.348]  Harry's sells their incredible razor blades online.
[03:20:17.348 --> 03:20:19.450]  They ship directly from their site to you.
[03:20:19.450 --> 03:20:20.632]  And do it for a lot less.
[03:20:21.172 --> 03:20:26.254]  And while those other guys rake in huge profits, Harry's passes the savings directly back to you.
[03:20:26.254 --> 03:20:27.134]  The result?
[03:20:27.134 --> 03:20:30.395]  A quality shave and more money in your pocket.
[03:20:30.395 --> 03:20:31.275]  Don't believe it?
[03:20:31.275 --> 03:20:33.236]  Try Harry's for yourself, for free.
[03:20:33.236 --> 03:20:35.497]  Just pay $3 in shipping when you sign up.
[03:20:35.497 --> 03:20:40.338]  Your set comes with a razor, shave gel, travel cover, and a post-shave balm.
[03:20:40.338 --> 03:20:42.859]  That's an almost $20 value, free.

[03:21:44.573 --> 03:21:47.534]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.

[03:22:28.852 --> 03:22:30.172]  It's called the Deep State.
[03:22:30.172 --> 03:22:34.954]  Barack Obama's most loyal aides still hold office and they want to stop President Trump.
[03:22:34.954 --> 03:22:39.015]  Deep State was first revealed in the runaway New York Times bestseller Big Agenda.
[03:22:39.015 --> 03:22:44.636]  David Horowitz's Big Agenda exposes Obama's government in exile and his shocking plan.

[03:24:03.797 --> 03:24:06.604]  Day after day, alone
[03:24:11.100 --> 03:24:18.704]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:24:18.704 --> 03:24:26.008]  I'm your pinch-hitting host, Roger Stone, sitting in for my friend Alex Jones.
[03:24:26.008 --> 03:24:37.114]  Alex Jones and InfoWars, both MVPs in the recent Trump revolution, particularly in the nomination phase, where I explain in my book
[03:24:37.950 --> 03:24:48.195]  The making of the President 2016, the vital role played by Infowars.com watchers and listeners in the Trump revolution.
[03:24:48.195 --> 03:24:51.377]  It truly was a tsunami.
[03:24:51.377 --> 03:24:55.479]  And my hat's off to Alex Jones for his courage.
[03:24:55.479 --> 03:24:59.241]  Once he made the decision to support Donald J. Trump, he never wavered.
[03:25:00.262 --> 03:25:04.067]  When they threw the Billy Bush tape at Trump.
[03:25:04.067 --> 03:25:08.152]  When they threw all kinds of false allegations.
[03:25:08.152 --> 03:25:10.756]  When things looked dim.
[03:25:10.756 --> 03:25:13.560]  When there was no guarantee of victory.
[03:25:14.520 --> 03:25:18.601]  Alex Jones was not a sunshine soldier.
[03:25:18.601 --> 03:25:28.883]  He was there, he was solid, and he rang the alerts to what was afoot.
[03:25:28.883 --> 03:25:37.024]  He was aggressive on the attack in terms of exposing the crimes of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[03:25:37.024 --> 03:25:41.285]  And therefore, yes, I am proud to be here on InfoWars.
[03:25:42.125 --> 03:25:48.669]  With a fellow warrior, Alex Jones, and the entire crew at InfoWars.
[03:25:48.669 --> 03:26:02.196]  Very big news today when it comes to Russia and the phony narrative put forward by the intelligence community, whose motive is quite clear.
[03:26:02.196 --> 03:26:07.079]  You see, Hillary Clinton promised them an expansion of the proxy war in Syria.
[03:26:07.859 --> 03:26:11.342]  They were really wringing their hands with glee.
[03:26:11.342 --> 03:26:12.023]  My God!
[03:26:12.023 --> 03:26:14.625]  A no-fly zone!
[03:26:14.625 --> 03:26:18.009]  We could even have World War III!
[03:26:18.009 --> 03:26:30.340]  And the globalists and neocons who infect the Central Intelligence Agency and the other 17 agencies that are involved in intelligence collection, including the NSA,
[03:26:31.281 --> 03:26:40.225]  Have been opposed to Donald Trump and his quest for peace in the region from the beginning.
[03:26:40.225 --> 03:26:43.486]  Now I've known Donald Trump for 40 years.
[03:26:43.486 --> 03:26:47.628]  He has no illusions about the Russian gulag.
[03:26:47.628 --> 03:26:53.771]  He has no illusions about the rottenness of the Russian system where
[03:26:54.662 --> 03:27:02.348]  Gays and Christians and women and Jews are persecuted, are oppressed.
[03:27:02.348 --> 03:27:10.735]  He has no illusions about Vladimir Putin's past as a KGB agent.
[03:27:10.735 --> 03:27:22.685]  He knows that Putin is a killer, but he also understands that peace requires some negotiation and some effort.
[03:27:23.604 --> 03:27:33.349]  Perhaps, just perhaps, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin can negotiate a just peace in the region.
[03:27:34.468 --> 03:27:53.300]  Given Assad's alleged gassing of children, given the fact that the opponents of Assad are propped up by ISIS and the Saudis, while Assad is propped up by the Russians and he's funding Hezbollah and Hamas and worse,
[03:27:54.341 --> 03:27:57.384]  We have no friends in this conflict, folks.
[03:27:57.384 --> 03:28:07.092]  There is nothing here that is worth dropping a drop of American blood or spending a borrowed American dollar.
[03:28:07.092 --> 03:28:13.156]  This explains why the intelligence agencies have invented the false Russian narrative.
[03:28:14.017 --> 03:28:27.470]  It diverts attention from the Podesta Brothers and the Clintons' own business activities in Russia, the phony bank deal, the phony gas deal, the phony stock deal.
[03:28:27.470 --> 03:28:35.758]  Once again, Dr. Jerry Corsi has reported on this both at WorldNetDaily and now at Infowars.com.
[03:28:35.758 --> 03:28:37.519]  So their strategy was brilliant.
[03:28:38.300 --> 03:28:48.095]  Divert from your own ties to Putin by falsely claiming Donald Trump is in bed with the Russians.
[03:28:48.095 --> 03:28:48.676]  It's a farce.
[03:28:49.733 --> 03:29:15.129]  And even factcheck.org, which is a liberal-leaning, or I should say establishment-leaning media organization, financed by the Walter Annenberg Foundation, even they found that the allegations by Congressman Adam Schiff against me, and others involved with Trump, but principally me, that I knew about Podesta's email hacking in advance, false!
[03:29:15.709 --> 03:29:23.255]  Or that I knew the scope and timing and extent of the WikiLeaks disclosures about Hillary.
[03:29:23.255 --> 03:29:24.696]  Also false.
[03:29:24.696 --> 03:29:30.621]  So I give credit to the folks at factcheck.org and I thank you for joining us here at InfoWars.
[03:29:49.335 --> 03:29:53.266]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.266 --> 03:29:55.953]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.521 --> 03:30:07.085]  The United States is rapidly and dangerously moving towards a war with North Korea.
[03:30:07.085 --> 03:30:26.138]  Retired four-star General Jack Keane, who turned down President Donald Trump's offer to be Secretary of Defense, says a preemptive strike on North Korea's nuclear facilities might be the only option we have left to stop them from developing nuclear missiles capable of striking the U.S.
[03:30:26.138 --> 03:30:29.660]  White House National Security Advisor KT McFarland says,
[03:30:30.080 --> 03:30:40.247]  If it fails to put pressure on North Korea to disable its nuclear program, there is a real possibility that North Korea will be able to hit the U.S.
[03:30:40.247 --> 03:30:45.430]  with a nuclear-armed missile by the end of Trump's first term as president.
[03:30:45.430 --> 03:30:52.455]  Meanwhile, China has vowed to defend its territory at all costs if the U.S.
[03:30:52.455 --> 03:30:55.857]  launches a military attack against North Korea.
[03:30:55.857 --> 03:30:59.340]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:31:00.240 --> 03:31:01.081]  Hey, everyone.
[03:31:01.081 --> 03:31:03.362]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:31:03.362 --> 03:31:07.204]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:31:07.204 --> 03:31:09.286]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:31:09.286 --> 03:31:19.552]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:31:19.552 --> 03:31:25.536]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:31:25.996 --> 03:31:40.913]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[03:31:40.973 --> 03:31:41.353]  I think so.
[03:32:00.686 --> 03:32:02.267]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:32:02.267 --> 03:32:07.191]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[03:32:07.191 --> 03:32:10.714]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[03:32:10.714 --> 03:32:16.518]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[03:32:16.518 --> 03:32:22.223]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[03:32:22.643 --> 03:32:25.605]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[03:32:25.605 --> 03:32:31.169]  Plus, you can take it with you to jump-start cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[03:32:31.169 --> 03:32:38.215]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[03:32:38.215 --> 03:32:42.758]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[03:32:43.038 --> 03:32:46.320]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.
[03:32:46.320 --> 03:32:48.421]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[03:32:48.421 --> 03:32:54.144]  Even better, use coupon code PRIVATE at checkout and get a second PPX energy unit for free.
[03:32:54.144 --> 03:32:56.566]  Check it out at privatepowergrid.com.
[03:32:56.566 --> 03:32:58.267]  That's privatepowergrid.com.
[03:33:04.133 --> 03:33:15.088]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:33:15.088 --> 03:33:16.670]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:33:22.336 --> 03:33:24.839]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:33:24.839 --> 03:33:37.814]  I'm Roger Stone, New York Times best-selling author, bon vivant, man about town, and a liberty-oriented American, and loyal supporter of Donald Trump.
[03:33:39.005 --> 03:33:43.867]  You know, it does pain me to offer criticisms of the Trump administration.
[03:33:43.867 --> 03:33:47.649]  They are not, at any time, criticisms of the President.
[03:33:47.649 --> 03:33:50.370]  I'm deeply invested in his success.
[03:33:50.370 --> 03:33:54.872]  I believe he is the one man who can make America great again.
[03:33:54.872 --> 03:33:58.754]  And therefore, when I see people in his administration
[03:34:00.394 --> 03:34:19.559]  Disserving him, you know, in the beginning I am loath to talk about it, but ultimately it has to be raised because this is our last best chance to save Western civilization, to save American culture and the American system as we know it.
[03:34:19.559 --> 03:34:22.940]  His election is a miracle, nothing short of it.
[03:34:23.985 --> 03:34:31.326]  I believe that Hillary Clinton and her allies spent as much as $2 billion in hard dollars.
[03:34:31.326 --> 03:34:48.830]  This doesn't count the soft money that Mr. Soros was spending with whacked out groups like Media Matters for America and other front groups that were designed to hide the Clintons' crimes and assault the Clintons' critics.
[03:34:50.270 --> 03:34:53.973]  Now you have the question of mainstream media.
[03:34:53.973 --> 03:34:58.356]  The constant negative drumbeat by CNN on Donald Trump.
[03:34:59.232 --> 03:35:06.177]  What was that worth in terms of commercial dollars because it was de facto advertising?
[03:35:06.177 --> 03:35:09.839]  The answer is hundreds of millions of dollars.
[03:35:09.839 --> 03:35:18.365]  So Donald Trump was outflanked in the old media and now we learn he was also outflanked in the new media.
[03:35:18.365 --> 03:35:27.191]  That the barons of Silicon Valley were monkeying with his algorithms and blocking his communications.
[03:35:28.533 --> 03:35:39.701]  Many of you know firsthand about the new censorship that's being unleashed against conservatives, libertarians, and any supporters of Donald Trump.
[03:35:39.701 --> 03:35:51.490]  For decades, many of us on the right were, you know, we were unconcerned about the venture capital on the left that was flowing to tech companies.
[03:35:51.490 --> 03:35:57.435]  But once established, many of these large companies began a symbiotic relationship
[03:35:58.274 --> 03:36:01.039]  With the Deep State.
[03:36:01.039 --> 03:36:10.455]  Facebook, Twitter, Google, and their property, YouTube, have all but locked up social media interactions in our country today.
[03:36:11.653 --> 03:36:15.936]  The old antitrust description fits most appropriately.
[03:36:15.936 --> 03:36:17.237]  Monopolies.
[03:36:17.237 --> 03:36:18.058]  Monopolies.
[03:36:18.058 --> 03:36:31.989]  These are left-leaning organizations and they are tilting public discourse in the direction of censorship via a variety of nefarious yet hidden methods.
[03:36:31.989 --> 03:36:34.731]  Terms have been invented to describe what they're up to.
[03:36:35.754 --> 03:36:50.058]  Censorship activities conducted by the tech left are called throttling, shadow bans, troll bots, SJW puppets, fake news flagging, and many other.
[03:36:50.058 --> 03:36:54.219]  In fact, new terms are being invented every single day.
[03:36:54.219 --> 03:37:04.842]  All of this activity boils down to a single objective, and that is to strangle dissent and to strangle the alternative voices like InfoWars.com.
[03:37:06.297 --> 03:37:15.485]  We at Stone Cold Truth have watched our audience, as they have at InfoWars, grow and grow and grow in the final months of the election.
[03:37:15.485 --> 03:37:19.588]  Finally, we were able to reach millions of people.
[03:37:19.588 --> 03:37:25.954]  And there is no doubt that this was a key factor in the upset victory of Donald Trump.
[03:37:27.298 --> 03:37:38.670]  You see, using rugged American individualism, we have stood up to the voices and the ideology and, frankly, the abuse of the left.
[03:37:38.670 --> 03:37:49.561]  But in their desperation now, the tech left is starting to slant the playing field further and further to the point of censorship.
[03:37:50.615 --> 03:37:57.617]  Censorship, of course, was a tactic used by both Hitler and Stalin.
[03:37:57.617 --> 03:38:04.318]  It is a clear indicator of a coming totalitarian state.
[03:38:04.318 --> 03:38:13.180]  See, I think the wackiest left-wing group in the country, people as irresponsible and dishonest and corrupt as, say, David Brock,
[03:38:13.996 --> 03:38:16.899]  They should not be banned on the internet.
[03:38:16.899 --> 03:38:22.765]  They should not be banned or throttled back on Facebook.
[03:38:22.765 --> 03:38:25.267]  Everyone should have a voice.
[03:38:25.267 --> 03:38:33.075]  That is the fundamental bedrock principle of our First Amendment and our American Constitution.
[03:38:33.075 --> 03:38:37.199]  And that is what we're fighting about in this particular fight.
[03:38:38.715 --> 03:38:45.399]  The left have professional agitators by the thousands and brain trusts by the score.
[03:38:45.399 --> 03:38:59.307]  They have deep pockets, more money than they know what to do with, and they're using it today to kill the Liberty Movement and try to kill off the presidency of Donald J. Trump.
[03:39:00.256 --> 03:39:08.082]  Make no mistake about it, this is the preparation for a silent coup that lies ahead.
[03:39:08.082 --> 03:39:16.569]  That is how bitter and disappointed the globalists are in their giant multi-billion dollar investment in Hillary Clinton.
[03:39:18.433 --> 03:39:27.285]  The tech left is extinguishing the passion and volunteer spirit that we see so prevalent here at InfoWars.com.
[03:39:27.285 --> 03:39:32.612]  Using professional trolls to spread hate is another key tactic.
[03:39:33.393 --> 03:39:49.988]  If you go to Twitter today, they are attacking my wife, attacking my family, attacking my dog, attacking my hair, attacking my glasses, attacking my clothing.
[03:39:49.988 --> 03:39:52.210]  It grows tedious.
[03:39:52.210 --> 03:39:53.090]  Very tedious.
[03:39:54.431 --> 03:40:02.756]  They say that I am all kinds of things, but they never mention New York Times best-selling author.
[03:40:02.756 --> 03:40:10.921]  They never mention the fact that I am a proud veteran of the campaigns of both Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump.
[03:40:11.974 --> 03:40:21.223]  They would have you believe that I am Lucifer himself, when it is the left that is demonistic.
[03:40:21.223 --> 03:40:24.867]  It is the left who are agnostic.
[03:40:24.867 --> 03:40:30.252]  It is the left who believe in the godless religion of globalism.
[03:40:31.590 --> 03:40:46.148]  Now, we understand that the left is in a panic, and we are very clear about what the strategy and the game plan of the tech left is.
[03:40:47.512 --> 03:40:52.777]  And this is not going to go down the way they think it is.
[03:40:52.777 --> 03:40:59.284]  Because they are subject to anti-trust law in this administration.
[03:40:59.284 --> 03:41:07.471]  They are subject to the dictates and rules passed by Congress and signed into law by the President.
[03:41:08.459 --> 03:41:32.868]  Anyone who thinks that Alex Jones or anyone else who is involved in alternative media is going to take this sitting down, that we are going to give up and surrender without a bloody fight, does not understand the nature of our determination to take our country back.
[03:41:34.335 --> 03:41:44.865]  Now if Attorney General Sessions would stop examining those states that have legally approved
[03:41:46.440 --> 03:42:06.812]  Recreational marijuana through the process of constitutional amendment, sometimes in many states requiring a 60% margin, and focused on the criminal and anti-trust and tortious interference of the internet giants.
[03:42:06.812 --> 03:42:14.357]  There is no question in my mind that there is appropriate legal action there.
[03:42:14.357 --> 03:42:15.598]  Why is this so important?
[03:42:16.573 --> 03:42:28.760]  In all candor, the chances of Donald Trump being re-elected in 2020 are zero if the vibrancy of alternative media is cut off.
[03:42:28.760 --> 03:42:40.266]  If we return to the days in which mainstream media held an absolute monopoly on the dissemination of political information.
[03:42:41.360 --> 03:42:52.462]  You see, in 1963, for example, there were only three networks, and therefore, if they didn't report something, it didn't happen.
[03:42:52.462 --> 03:43:02.365]  This is why I have believed that the cover-up in the murder of President John F. Kennedy was so easy to perpetrate.
[03:43:02.365 --> 03:43:08.866]  The mainstream media of the day was able to easily control the narrative.
[03:43:10.396 --> 03:43:37.216]  As you will find in my book, The Man Who Killed Kennedy, The Case Against LBJ, FBI agents actually showed up at the Daily Newspaper in Dallas and dictated the stories for page one and killed stories that did not agree with the government's immediate narrative that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and he killed John Kennedy.
[03:43:38.314 --> 03:43:52.104]  Now, today, such a claim could never be sustained because of the vibrancy of the internet and alternative media.
[03:43:52.104 --> 03:44:04.574]  There would be, instead of one Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination, there would be hundreds of cell phone cameras recording the event for history.
[03:44:05.600 --> 03:44:09.362]  Making a cover-up almost impossible.
[03:44:09.362 --> 03:44:26.311]  That gives you a graphic example of why it is crucial that this fight be fought and that the Trump administration understand the stakes and what is at hand in terms of this challenge.
[03:44:27.369 --> 03:44:36.659]  This is a life and death struggle, not only for the future of the Liberty Movement, but the future of the country itself.
[03:44:36.659 --> 03:44:44.467]  This is certainly, in raw political terms, a crucial fight for the future of the Trump presidency.
[03:44:46.121 --> 03:44:50.725]  Does son-in-law Jared Kushner understand this challenge?
[03:44:50.725 --> 03:45:06.519]  Or is he being lulled to sleep by the Silicon Valley supplicants now taking the trek to New York to wine and dine the presidential son-in-law and his wife?
[03:45:07.659 --> 03:45:24.110]  Now, before we leave this segment, I want to put in a plug for a product that I have now just tried, and this is the Caveman formula, available at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:45:25.111 --> 03:45:29.717]  This is the true cutting edge of paleo nutrition.
[03:45:29.717 --> 03:45:39.069]  This is a special formula that utilizes seven different superfoods with a super high quality bone broth.
[03:45:40.106 --> 03:45:43.548]  The benefits are extraordinary.
[03:45:43.548 --> 03:45:46.949]  It torques up your immune system.
[03:45:46.949 --> 03:45:54.833]  It provides for clearer skin, for stronger bones, for overall health.
[03:45:55.453 --> 03:46:13.733]  This is an ancient formula that has been souped up with some modern ingredients, and it is really above anything else you can find on the commercial market when it comes to an overall nutrition.
[03:46:14.913 --> 03:46:29.820]  That helps build the immune system and also helps kill the free radicals that are a result of eating processed food and breathing polluted air.
[03:46:29.820 --> 03:46:32.561]  So I recommend this product.
[03:46:32.561 --> 03:46:40.605]  It is 33% off retail today at the store at the Infowars.com store and you're not just getting
[03:46:41.641 --> 03:46:43.584]  A great product, folks!
[03:46:43.584 --> 03:46:46.569]  You are funding the fight for freedom!
[03:46:46.569 --> 03:46:50.855]  You are funding the First Amendment in action!
[03:46:50.855 --> 03:46:54.621]  You are funding the tip of the spear!
[03:46:54.621 --> 03:46:55.202]  InfoWars.com
[03:46:57.403 --> 03:47:11.376]  This fight is not winnable without the leadership and the voice of Alex Jones and so many who are there on the team at InfoWars.com.
[03:47:11.376 --> 03:47:14.479]  And this is our oxygen.
[03:47:14.479 --> 03:47:20.264]  You see, InfoWars doesn't have big multinational corporate sponsors.
[03:47:21.325 --> 03:47:25.950]  Who tell Alex Jones what he can and cannot say on the air?
[03:47:25.950 --> 03:47:28.392]  No, we're true to ourselves.
[03:47:28.392 --> 03:47:35.800]  And that's why your support at the InfoWars.com store is so crucial to the future fight for freedom.
[03:47:36.909 --> 03:47:45.252]  There are no products there that don't have hundreds of testimonials in terms of their efficacy and their quality.
[03:47:45.252 --> 03:47:59.038]  And of course, you can buy The Making of the President 2016, the story of how Donald Trump orchestrated an American Revolution, right there at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:47:59.998 --> 03:48:26.720]  This historic book lays the groundwork on the entire Russian myth, on the phony narrative created by John Podesta to distract from his own business activities with the Kremlin, and to cast questions about the legitimacy and the stability of the Trump administration.
[03:48:27.719 --> 03:48:30.720]  There is no Russian collusion.
[03:48:30.720 --> 03:48:40.383]  Even Congressman Adam Schiff, a man who I said from the beginning was full of schiff, even he is now in retreat.
[03:48:40.383 --> 03:48:46.125]  The hard evidence that they promised us existed seems to have gone missing.
[03:48:46.125 --> 03:48:49.766]  And now, with the criminal activities of Susan Rice,
[03:48:50.586 --> 03:48:55.292]  Well, the focus is back where it belonged.
[03:48:55.292 --> 03:49:06.805]  On those who use the Russian collusion myth as a rationale, as a legal justification for spying on the President.
[03:49:07.839 --> 03:49:17.867]  I predict to you here and now that we will learn that surveillance of Donald Trump was broader and longer than we have been told thus far.
[03:49:17.867 --> 03:49:29.816]  But the FBI Director and the NSA Director, Admiral Rogers, both testified under oath that there was no surveillance of the President.
[03:49:29.816 --> 03:49:33.479]  That turns out to be perjury.
[03:49:33.479 --> 03:49:33.880]  A lie.
[03:49:34.904 --> 03:49:58.200]  And, as we learned here at Infowars.com only weeks ago, the government has had an active program called Dragnet that has been monitoring and recording the telephone conversations of some 600-plus prominent Americans, some other not-so-prominent Americans, but that list included Donald J. Trump
[03:49:58.840 --> 03:50:11.568]  Who is monitored from his New York office, his New York apartment, his Palm Beach apartment, his Palm Beach country club or golf club and several other Trump resorts.
[03:50:11.568 --> 03:50:20.094]  Folks, the deep state is busted and they know it and that's why this hysterical attack
[03:50:20.974 --> 03:50:30.442]  On the media outlets like InfoWars.com who are letting the American people know what is really going on.
[03:50:30.442 --> 03:50:32.904]  I thank you for your support of InfoWars.
[03:50:32.904 --> 03:50:40.990]  I thank you support of InfoWars Store to keep the theme of freedom on the airwaves.
[03:50:40.990 --> 03:50:42.051]  I'll be right back.
[03:50:42.051 --> 03:50:42.612]  Many thanks.
[03:51:00.794 --> 03:51:02.715]  Extend-A-Vite really works.
[03:51:02.715 --> 03:51:04.915]  Just listen to what some people have to say.
[03:51:04.915 --> 03:51:08.496]  About six months ago, my wife bought the Extend-A-Vite.
[03:51:08.496 --> 03:51:10.677]  She didn't tell me she was giving it to me.
[03:51:10.677 --> 03:51:15.079]  So after about three days, I said, you know, maybe the weather's changed or something.
[03:51:15.079 --> 03:51:17.099]  I said, my legs feel really good.
[03:51:17.099 --> 03:51:20.660]  And she goes, well, I've been giving you this stuff, and it was the Extend-A-Vite.
[03:51:20.660 --> 03:51:24.261]  And you know that I'm about 75% better.
[03:51:24.261 --> 03:51:28.263]  I can actually climb stairs now, and I can get up out of chairs.
[03:51:28.263 --> 03:51:29.263]  I can even get
[03:51:29.843 --> 03:51:36.268]  I got to work under a table or a computer table and work on a computer and I can actually get back up off the floor.
[03:51:36.268 --> 03:51:36.708]  You know what?
[03:51:36.708 --> 03:51:37.889]  It's an amazing product.
[03:51:37.889 --> 03:51:42.031]  I can't believe, I didn't think anything short of having surgery was going to help.
[03:51:42.031 --> 03:51:47.055]  Extendivite is only $69.95 for a two month supply of either capsules or liquid.

[03:51:59.571 --> 03:52:00.672]  Think about this.
[03:52:00.672 --> 03:52:13.180]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[03:52:13.180 --> 03:52:17.183]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[03:54:06.596 --> 03:54:12.179]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[03:54:12.179 --> 03:54:15.561]  I've never been with anything less than a dime.
[03:54:15.561 --> 03:54:17.962]  Welcome back to Infowars.
[03:54:17.962 --> 03:54:23.125]  I'm your host, Roger Stone, sitting in for my friend Alex Jones.
[03:54:24.145 --> 03:54:30.271]  We are, without any question, at one of the most exciting times in American history.
[03:54:30.271 --> 03:54:48.369]  The Soros-funded group with the highfalutin name Fight for the Future, FFTF, claiming to be for internet freedom and civil liberties, is actually attempting to achieve the exact opposite.
[03:54:49.009 --> 03:54:55.633]  They want to shut down free communications on the alternative right.
[03:54:55.633 --> 03:55:06.398]  Pencil neck geeks like David Brock are launching an assault on our very freedom of expression.
[03:55:06.398 --> 03:55:10.240]  And we have no intention of standing for it.
[03:55:10.240 --> 03:55:15.983]  And no intention of not fighting this effort on every front.
[03:55:17.247 --> 03:55:21.391]  I want to take a minute to pay tribute to two of my colleagues.
[03:55:21.391 --> 03:55:26.956]  Jack Posobiec, who has now joined the rebel, is their new Washington, D.C.
[03:55:26.956 --> 03:55:28.438]  correspondent.
[03:55:28.438 --> 03:55:42.110]  Jack is an important foot soldier in the Trump revolution, one of the key figures behind Citizens for Trump, an independent organization, and I salute Jack on his new assignment.
[03:55:42.811 --> 03:56:10.099]  And my hat's off to Mike Cernovich, a patriot, a freedom fighter, and the man who learned and passed on to the media that Susan Rice had illegally unmasked a number of key Trump associates, myself included, in her efforts to sift intelligence information for political reasons.
[03:56:10.859 --> 03:56:14.840]  Now, Susan Rice has a history as a proven liar.
[03:56:14.840 --> 03:56:36.546]  If you read my book on Benghazi, you know that she lied about the idea that a mob, a rabble, attacked our mission in Benghazi, incensed over an anti-Islamic video that was allegedly shown once in Turkey.
[03:56:37.486 --> 03:56:53.127]  So we have a habitual liar and now I agree with Senator Rand Paul's notion that it's time for a subpoena and it's time for her to testify before the Congress.
[03:56:54.028 --> 03:57:10.206]  Speaking of testifying before the Congress, I have let the Senate and House Intelligence Committees know that I am prepared to show up without a subpoena, that I am not asking for any kind of immunity, and that I want to testify in public.
[03:57:11.158 --> 03:57:34.120]  You see, I will put the lie to this myth of Russian collusion to elect Donald Trump and demonstrate how it has been used for the rationale to illegally surveil first candidate Trump and then President-elect Trump and perhaps even President Trump.
[03:57:34.120 --> 03:57:34.800]  Stay tuned.
[03:57:35.581 --> 03:57:44.584]  And then, lastly, folks, you can go to the Infowars.com store and grab your copy of The Making of the President 2016.
[03:57:44.584 --> 03:57:48.385]  This is one of the most dynamic political books I think you will ever read.
[03:57:48.385 --> 03:57:56.528]  It is an insider story about how Donald Trump and his colleagues on the alternative media write.
[03:57:57.148 --> 03:58:02.730]  Pulled off the greatest upset in American political history.
[03:58:02.730 --> 03:58:09.013]  Thanks for joining us here at InfoWars, and please visit the InfoWars store now.
[03:58:42.789 --> 03:58:46.768]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
