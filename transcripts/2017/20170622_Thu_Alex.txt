[00:00:14.776 --> 00:00:19.739]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:22.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.560]  I've got to give credit where credit's due.
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.382]  The mainstream media will attack Hannity for this, but it doesn't matter.
[00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:38.845]  That'll just make him have more viewers and more supporters, though News Corp has been very close to firing him.
[00:00:39.946 --> 00:00:51.212]  I talked to witnesses a month ago when the reports came out that he was going to be fired, who talked to Hannity at Fox News, where he'd been chewed out for hours by the General Counsel, and they had said, you keep doing what you're doing, you're fired.
[00:00:52.130 --> 00:01:00.172]  But he has so much support, and it's so obvious that Fox News is sinking after the Democrat coup there, that they have not gotten rid of him yet.
[00:01:01.092 --> 00:01:07.994]  But the fact is, I know from the White House that no one in media talks to President Trump more than Sean Hannity.
[00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:18.077]  Sean Hannity talks to President Trump two or three times a day, sometimes at length, and I'll just tell you right now, Sean Hannity is
[00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:26.108]  Currently, the main leader of the resistance against the globalists, outside of Trump, and then of course myself.
[00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:31.632]  But I am more grassroots, and I'm more frontline, being demonized, being attacked.
[00:01:31.972 --> 00:01:38.838]  It's my job to get the intel out, to take the main attack, to draw the enemy fire, so that we understand exactly what we're dealing with.
[00:01:38.858 --> 00:01:41.080]  But I don't give credit where credit's due.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.843]  He has the most courage of anybody in the media, and
[00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:49.261]  His head's on the chopping block because of it.
[00:01:50.242 --> 00:01:51.082]  But he's held on.
[00:01:51.102 --> 00:01:57.623]  And then on Tuesday night, he came out and the Washington Post, you know, obviously pointed this out.
[00:01:58.223 --> 00:02:00.544]  Word for word quoted what I've said.
[00:02:01.544 --> 00:02:02.924]  But he wasn't plagiarizing me.
[00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:08.165]  Headline, Fox News Sean Hannity is encroaching on Alex Jones territory.
[00:02:09.526 --> 00:02:15.887]  He was quoting what the Defense Department and the President is telling him.
[00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:18.836]  Because what I've told you is what's happening.
[00:02:19.496 --> 00:02:23.057]  So Hannity's not even getting this from me, he's getting this from reality.
[00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:27.958]  You know, we all go to the same Super Bowl game and watch the New England Patriots win last year.
[00:02:27.978 --> 00:02:31.779]  We weren't plagiarizing each other, we saw the same thing.
[00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.560]  So listen to me very, very carefully.
[00:02:35.478 --> 00:02:40.261]  The number one issue we've got to expose is the Democrat plan to overthrow Trump.
[00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:43.202]  He's just won four special elections.
[00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:46.204]  He's really above 60 in the Gallup polls.
[00:02:46.604 --> 00:02:51.847]  If you look at their margin of error, how they oversample Democrats, a lot of incredible things are happening right now.
[00:02:53.863 --> 00:02:55.926]  And they know they're dying as a party.
[00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:57.769]  They know globalism is dying.
[00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.451]  So they're very dangerous.
[00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.973]  They're very cornered right now.
[00:03:01.453 --> 00:03:07.942]  And the Washington Post is saying Sean Hannity should be fired for this because this is insane and he's making stuff up.
[00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:21.092]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have so much proof of the Democrats saying, overthrow Trump, use COG, kill him, kill his supporters, cancel the last election, remove the Republicans that were elected in the last 2016 election.
[00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:24.294]  I mean, I've got the mainstream articles here where they're pushing it.
[00:03:24.874 --> 00:03:28.737]  In the New Yorker Magazine, Atlantic Monthly, Financial Times, New York Times.
[00:03:28.877 --> 00:03:33.861]  So we're going to go over all that today and break this down, but first here's Sean Hannity.
[00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:47.512]  Also tonight, a soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office.
[00:03:48.032 --> 00:03:54.113]  Sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear and present danger.
[00:03:54.654 --> 00:03:56.694]  That is tonight's very important opening monologue.
[00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:05.713]  All right, so here in America, we're at a turning point tonight with forces now forming an alliance to try and remove President Trump from office.
[00:04:05.813 --> 00:04:06.614]  It's that serious.
[00:04:06.994 --> 00:04:10.698]  Now, here are the five dangers we are facing, especially the president.
[00:04:10.858 --> 00:04:15.283]  One, you've got the destroy Trump media that has been lying to you now.
[00:04:15.603 --> 00:04:18.206]  Provable lies for 11 months, non-stop.
[00:04:18.546 --> 00:04:19.988]  Trump-Russia collusion.
[00:04:20.348 --> 00:04:21.469]  Black helicopter theories.
[00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.652]  No evidence whatsoever.
[00:04:24.112 --> 00:04:32.021]  Two, you've got what I've been calling the deep state, selectively leaking information to damage the president and anyone associated with him.
[00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:37.244]  Three, Special Counsel Mueller's investigation mission creep I've been telling you about.
[00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:41.387]  Well, it's now turned into an out-of-control, what is a political witch hunt.
[00:04:41.787 --> 00:04:42.808]  It needs to be stopped.
[00:04:43.288 --> 00:04:53.195]  Four, all this manufactured turmoil putting President Trump's agenda in jeopardy, which ends up directly impacting every one of you out there and the American people.
[00:04:53.675 --> 00:05:02.381]  And five, this effort to override the will of the American people, change the results of a presidential election, is now creating a national security crisis.
[00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:03.201]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:18.822]  Again, I want to thank you all humbly for fighting the globalists.
[00:05:18.862 --> 00:05:20.322]  I want to thank you for your financial support.
[00:05:20.722 --> 00:05:25.744]  You're the reasons we're still here and growing in the face of an unprecedented onslaught.

[00:08:14.268 --> 00:08:19.030]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:25.794]  How many times must I tell you, baby?
[00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:37.107]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is undoubtedly, right now, June 22nd, 2017, the most important broadcast I have ever given in 22 years.
[00:08:37.127 --> 00:08:37.647]  No doubt.
[00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.991]  Now over the years, it's probably been 30, 40 times I've said that.
[00:08:57.591 --> 00:08:59.832]  Because the world's getting more intense, more is happening.
[00:09:02.312 --> 00:09:22.077]  But now, now ladies and gentlemen, undoubtedly, we know for sure the globalist plan, we know for certain how horrible it is, we know analytically, culturally, historically, spiritually, financially, metaphysically,
[00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:28.121]  Just how dangerous this existential clear and present danger is.
[00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:44.166]  That is the term that I have brought back into vogue that has now been picked up by a lot of serious people at the Pentagon and also that are left in mainstream media that are actually trying to save the country.
[00:09:44.967 --> 00:09:50.889]  Because currently there is a soft coup operating towards a hot coup
[00:09:55.788 --> 00:10:08.511]  And preparing the public mind for the overthrow of President Trump, the cancelling of the 2016 election, and then most of the Republicans elected under the 2016 election will basically be removed from office.
[00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:17.012]  New special elections will be held, overseen by the Department of Homeland Security, which will then fully federalize all 50 states.
[00:10:17.292 --> 00:10:24.594]  Now, many of you who are tuning in go, yes, you've been saying this since the election, since Obama signed an executive order setting that up.
[00:10:25.618 --> 00:10:29.740]  And Trump's been unable to remove the bureaucracy that still has that in place.
[00:10:31.561 --> 00:10:52.914]  You have all 50 state attorney generals sending letters three months ago to Congress and to the President and to the other branches of government saying, this is outrageous, you can't federalize all 50 state elections, it violates the federal clause, it violates the Constitution, this is an emergency, what's going on?
[00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:59.577]  This is unprecedented, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:59.597 --> 00:11:15.080]  This is a soft coup that is meant to then exponentially, as the ambient temperatures turned up, escalate into a civil emergency, martial law, the assassination of Trump.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.260]  They're not going to let him live.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.421]  They're not going to let him defend himself.
[00:11:18.881 --> 00:11:25.482]  And then a paramilitary move by fifth columns inside the intelligence agencies, the media,
[00:11:26.997 --> 00:11:33.740]  That list of names are deader than a hammer in the first hours of this if they launch it.
[00:11:51.502 --> 00:12:07.377]  So everybody should have their security contingencies ready and should know that you're all personally in your Alamo positions or your 300 positions, whatever you want to call it, because we have to make that stand as long as possible if they move.
[00:12:07.677 --> 00:12:08.878]  This is not a joke, folks.
[00:12:09.739 --> 00:12:10.720]  This is not a game.
[00:12:11.281 --> 00:12:12.682]  They'll set a nuke off in D.C.
[00:12:12.722 --> 00:12:13.843]  if they have to to bring in this.
[00:12:14.304 --> 00:12:16.706]  They're not going to be dug out without a fight.
[00:12:20.325 --> 00:12:25.789]  Now, Colonel Schaffer has been involved in black ops to the highest level.
[00:12:25.809 --> 00:12:31.433]  He's been a whistleblower exposing our government working with radical Islam going back to the year 2000.
[00:12:32.613 --> 00:12:34.094]  He's a contributor to Fox News.
[00:12:34.214 --> 00:12:35.976]  He also works with the London Group.
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.581]  He is an expert on terrorism.
[00:12:38.982 --> 00:12:42.245]  Through other sources I have, we knew the terror attacks were coming in London.
[00:12:42.665 --> 00:12:44.066]  There was an order to stand down.
[00:12:45.107 --> 00:12:46.788]  He's one of the best sources you can get.
[00:12:46.868 --> 00:12:50.331]  He's on the broadcast in the last 30 minutes of the third hour today.
[00:12:52.133 --> 00:13:00.200]  He said a month ago on Lou Dobbs Fox Business exactly what I've been saying word for word.
[00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:04.023]  Now Sean Hannity has said what I've been warning you of.
[00:13:04.584 --> 00:13:06.425]  Word for word.
[00:13:07.767 --> 00:13:08.668]  Now, you have to understand something.
[00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:10.409]  It's not about credit to Alex Jones.
[00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.132]  I've reverse-engineered the Globalist.
[00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:17.516]  I've reverse-engineered other COG operations like Valkyrie in Germany in 1944.
[00:13:19.272 --> 00:13:33.443]  I have interviewed all the top experts and I'm watching and reading elite publications because something this big, they've got to say it out in the open to get people with cold feet lined up thinking, well we must be in power, we must have a shot at this.
[00:13:35.644 --> 00:13:43.030]  They're hyping themselves up, they're jumping up and down like a bunch of warriors getting ready to run down the creek bed and attack the tribe over the next hill.
[00:13:44.326 --> 00:13:51.429]  They got themselves like a bunch of coyotes when they get ready to go hunting, running around yipping and barking and squealing and howling, getting all hyped up for the hunt.
[00:13:51.809 --> 00:13:55.790]  They're running around with war drums, ladies and gentlemen, encircling us.
[00:13:57.131 --> 00:14:02.453]  You don't have to believe me, you can look out over the edge of the raft and there's big old sharks going around in circles.
[00:14:04.614 --> 00:14:06.814]  The difference is, we have the tools to defeat these people.
[00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:07.775]  They're in the wrong.
[00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:10.556]  They're a bunch of anti-American, anti-free market scum.
[00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:18.914]  They thought they had this country and their plans were so bad once Hillary got in to shut down the press, arrest people, have a reign of terror.
[00:14:18.954 --> 00:14:23.196]  It's all been announced that finally people inside our intelligence agency said this is insane.
[00:14:23.437 --> 00:14:24.417]  We're not going along with it.
[00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:26.919]  But they only stopped her from getting in.
[00:14:26.979 --> 00:14:28.600]  The whole deep state was still there.
[00:14:29.181 --> 00:14:31.602]  The bought and paid for traitor media was all still there.
[00:14:33.243 --> 00:14:39.748]  And so the Washington Post has a big article saying Fox News's Hannity is encroaching on Alex Jones territory and needs to be fired.
[00:14:41.135 --> 00:14:51.758]  This is the same Washington Post that got $600 million in taxpayer money from the CIA last year in the final months of Obama as a panic move.
[00:14:51.778 --> 00:14:57.500]  $600 million contract to destroy Trump for one newspaper.
[00:14:58.781 --> 00:15:00.881]  Owned by Bezos.
[00:15:01.782 --> 00:15:03.282]  $600 million.
[00:15:03.822 --> 00:15:08.864]  Billions have been spent on the Islamic marches, the feminist marches, the zombie commie marches.
[00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:11.390]  That are coming out of the woodwork.
[00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:13.211]  The cop killing marches.
[00:15:13.651 --> 00:15:14.012]  All of it.
[00:15:15.212 --> 00:15:16.853]  Make no mistake.
[00:15:17.693 --> 00:15:20.735]  100% they're planning a hot coup.
[00:15:21.215 --> 00:15:22.415]  The soft coup is the build up.
[00:15:24.196 --> 00:15:27.278]  And they quote me in here using the term clear and present danger.
[00:15:27.338 --> 00:15:29.959]  That's a term used by the military.
[00:15:31.172 --> 00:15:32.592]  When you've got to move against something.
[00:15:33.193 --> 00:15:37.974]  And they make fun of Hannity and myself for using it and say, oh my gosh, look, Hannity's quoting Alex Jones.
[00:15:38.374 --> 00:15:39.475]  He's not quoting me.
[00:15:39.795 --> 00:15:42.136]  This is what the patriots of the Pentagon are calling it.
[00:15:43.056 --> 00:15:44.957]  The patriots left in the CIA are calling it.
[00:15:47.077 --> 00:15:49.218]  Sinister forces quickly aligning.
[00:15:49.478 --> 00:15:50.539]  A clear and present danger.
[00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:56.001]  Now, they think it's discrediting that Hannity's basically quoting me.
[00:15:56.961 --> 00:15:57.041]  No.
[00:15:58.573 --> 00:15:59.673]  That's a badge of honor.
[00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:01.634]  Who else will talk about this?
[00:16:01.694 --> 00:16:02.314]  Not even Limbaugh.
[00:16:02.674 --> 00:16:08.095]  There's Sean Hannity, Pat Drudge has linked to stories on it, Colonel Schaefer, Lou Dobbs, a few others.
[00:16:08.796 --> 00:16:12.096]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have to get this narrative out to everybody.
[00:16:12.136 --> 00:16:14.817]  So let me punch up three of my top researchers and editors.
[00:16:14.877 --> 00:16:17.178]  Rob Dube, Michael Zimmerman, of course, Jeremy McBreen.
[00:16:17.198 --> 00:16:21.199]  You guys work 12 hours a day, usually 14 hours a day, six days a week.
[00:16:21.599 --> 00:16:22.639]  You deserve more time off.
[00:16:22.659 --> 00:16:24.580]  We're trying to hire more good editors and researchers.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.560]  We've got a great crew.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.300]  I never call you guys in to do this.
[00:16:29.281 --> 00:16:30.401]  This is so important, though.
[00:16:30.461 --> 00:16:33.961]  I'm just in front of the whole crew, the whole audience, the listeners, other talk show hosts, everybody.
[00:16:34.322 --> 00:16:37.802]  If we don't expose this now, they're going to get away with it.
[00:16:37.862 --> 00:16:44.623]  They want to deny it's happening and say it's insane, because if we build opposition to it, they're going to fall.
[00:16:45.264 --> 00:16:52.485]  Just like they said, oh, nobody's trying to steal the nomination from Trump, when they admittedly were trying, because they didn't want opposition to build.
[00:16:55.385 --> 00:16:59.547]  Just like they have done over and over again.
[00:16:59.667 --> 00:17:01.228]  Or, oh, we're not going to try to take electors.
[00:17:01.768 --> 00:17:07.571]  We're not going to try to take the nomination or the seating of the president on January 20th, which they then tried to do.
[00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:16.052]  They're in Atlantic Monthly, Washington Post, New York Times, everywhere saying overthrow Trump, COG, cancel the election.
[00:17:16.232 --> 00:17:23.495]  They're moving to do it, but they want to incrementally build their fake case while they beaver away with moles leaking this info.
[00:17:23.775 --> 00:17:28.678]  This is a foreign, global, multinational, corporate, combined sabotage operation.
[00:17:29.078 --> 00:17:33.820]  Every person involved in this, under law, deserves to be executed.
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.640]  If we end up defeating them.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.861]  And I don't want blood and death.
[00:17:37.001 --> 00:17:37.381]  They do.
[00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:44.484]  These are all actual Benedict Arnolds sabotaging America, sabotaging our economy, admitting they want to kill our economy.
[00:17:44.644 --> 00:17:46.085]  But I want them to understand something.
[00:17:46.825 --> 00:17:48.446]  I know you're preparing for war and death.
[00:17:48.806 --> 00:17:50.887]  I know you're preparing the hit teams to go after everybody.
[00:17:51.287 --> 00:17:52.067]  Understand this.
[00:17:52.627 --> 00:17:56.449]  There will be a response back to that as Colonel Schaefer said earlier this week on Fox News.
[00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.812]  One way or another, you're going to get beat.
[00:18:00.552 --> 00:18:02.134]  One way or another, you're going down.
[00:18:02.694 --> 00:18:03.535]  You wanna bang heads?
[00:18:03.855 --> 00:18:04.356]  Let's do it!
[00:18:06.926 --> 00:18:32.423]  I just want to tell the crew, these are some of my best editors, guys, I need you to get all the clips of them saying kill the president, all the clips where they say overthrow the election, all the clips of where they say use COG, all the clips of where they say get rid of all the Republicans that were elected in the last election, all the clips of Homeland Security saying it's going to federalize the elections, and Obama's executive order, and all of it, to show people, and then I'll shoot a video reading from the Washington Post, making fun of it, saying it doesn't exist.
[00:18:32.623 --> 00:18:34.424]  Just like election fraud, skip this break please.
[00:18:35.025 --> 00:18:36.386]  Just like election fraud,
[00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:38.847]  Doesn't supposedly exist.
[00:18:40.108 --> 00:18:45.232]  And then now we learn it's not 3.3 million illegals voting, it's 5.7 million in the new big studies.
[00:18:45.532 --> 00:18:48.915]  And they're busting people and people voting under dead names everywhere.
[00:18:50.196 --> 00:18:52.718]  I saw the news go, how did dead people vote, Jones?
[00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:54.679]  Oh, I think their readers are dumb.
[00:18:55.119 --> 00:18:56.861]  People voting in the names of dead people.
[00:18:57.601 --> 00:19:00.603]  They go to the obituaries, they get the names, they check the voter rolls.
[00:19:01.344 --> 00:19:05.027]  They're catching them in every state and it's always Democrats.
[00:19:06.536 --> 00:19:07.896]  So listen folks, this is it.
[00:19:07.936 --> 00:19:09.897]  This is the greatest threat our country's ever faced.
[00:19:10.557 --> 00:19:12.917]  They're trying to start wars to distract the President.
[00:19:13.317 --> 00:19:15.778]  They are trying to plunge the economy to discredit the President.
[00:19:16.278 --> 00:19:18.638]  Because he's daring to try to restore the Republic.
[00:19:18.678 --> 00:19:20.799]  He's not perfect, but he's not out to get you.
[00:19:20.979 --> 00:19:22.619]  And he wants prosperity, not austerity.
[00:19:23.479 --> 00:19:26.300]  So understand, this is the great fight for America.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.580]  This is the big war.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.820]  The election was just D-Day and was a beachhead.
[00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:33.281]  You understand that?
[00:19:33.741 --> 00:19:34.241]  This is it.
[00:19:35.267 --> 00:19:41.375]  This is the destiny of the planet against unelected global corporations that have established a tyrannical system known as globalism.
[00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:50.268]  My son is here working now as an editor and doing work and research.
[00:19:50.308 --> 00:19:56.591]  Rex Jones, all of you, the entire team, we need to focus on the attempt to overthrow the Republic.
[00:19:57.032 --> 00:20:05.636]  The attempt, they're so upset by this fourth special election that they put more money on than in history the Democratic Party did, outspending 5 to 1, 10 to 1.
[00:20:07.797 --> 00:20:25.556]  On these races, I've got the numbers here, some cases 15 to 1, and being annihilated despite election fraud and everything else they're doing, there isn't a realignment, there isn't awakening, the people are sick of these elites, they're sick of Nancy Pelosi, they're sick of Maxine Waters, and men, we have to make this the big focus, because I'm telling you...
[00:20:26.906 --> 00:20:29.529]  They are planning civil unrest that they're going to blame on us.
[00:20:29.829 --> 00:20:32.712]  They're planning the murder of our president to trigger the civil unrest.
[00:20:33.032 --> 00:20:34.814]  And we've got to stop this.
[00:20:35.155 --> 00:20:38.158]  We have got to stop this or evacuate the United States.
[00:20:39.383 --> 00:20:41.024]  Because this is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:41.204 --> 00:20:42.624]  Fight or flight, I'm staying.
[00:20:43.245 --> 00:20:44.245]  You guys want to make any comments?
[00:20:44.305 --> 00:20:47.927]  Because I'm about to get into Colonel Schaefer's clips and the new Hannity clip.
[00:20:48.067 --> 00:20:49.287]  They're calling for him to be fired over.
[00:20:49.487 --> 00:20:52.089]  Yeah, I just want to say that you look at the leadership.
[00:20:52.169 --> 00:20:53.209]  Comey, afraid.
[00:20:53.289 --> 00:20:55.070]  He admitted he's afraid to say stuff.
[00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.471]  Jay Johnson admitted he was afraid to say anything about the Russian clip.
[00:20:58.491 --> 00:21:01.233]  These people are total pansy wusses.
[00:21:01.913 --> 00:21:02.853]  And we have to take it to them.
[00:21:02.873 --> 00:21:04.614]  We have to just meet them on the battlefield.
[00:21:04.634 --> 00:21:05.554]  They will not stand up.
[00:21:05.594 --> 00:21:07.815]  When you stand up to them, they back down every time.
[00:21:07.855 --> 00:21:08.756]  So that's all we have to do.
[00:21:10.578 --> 00:21:16.282]  Yeah, Alex, I also want to point out that we're seeing a lot of, you know, they can't have a civil war.
[00:21:16.782 --> 00:21:20.425]  They need a lot of Americans to join in on this.
[00:21:20.665 --> 00:21:27.469]  And what's happening, a lot of Americans are getting radicalized by the Hollywood elite and even by late night television.
[00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:28.690]  We've run into a lot of people.
[00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.592]  Yeah, these are the casualties of brainwashing.
[00:21:31.612 --> 00:21:32.072]  Exactly.
[00:21:33.453 --> 00:21:39.979]  Yeah, they will consider Stephen Colbert, Saturday Night Live, that's real news, and that's where they get their news from.
[00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:42.141]  So a lot of these people are getting radicalized.
[00:21:42.441 --> 00:21:51.850]  We've seen the social justice warriors, we've seen the Antifa protests across the country, and they're getting more and more violent, and they are attacking Trump supporters.
[00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.171]  Right, and they're targeting Trump supporters.
[00:21:54.532 --> 00:21:55.792]  So that is going on as well.
[00:21:55.832 --> 00:22:00.035]  They want civil unrest, and then they want to usher order out of chaos.
[00:22:00.155 --> 00:22:00.675]  That's their objective.
[00:22:00.715 --> 00:22:01.076]  Exactly.
[00:22:01.096 --> 00:22:09.201]  They're launching maximum revolution, maximum violence, in preparation, just like Soros has done in over 50 other countries, with the Arab Spring, Ukraine.
[00:22:09.301 --> 00:22:10.782]  They mean business.
[00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:15.925]  And Trump thinks he can just have prosperity and, you know, let Goldman Sachs make record profits.
[00:22:15.965 --> 00:22:19.827]  They still want to destroy him because they don't want any of the profit going to the people.
[00:22:20.108 --> 00:22:20.968]  It's total control.
[00:22:21.368 --> 00:22:22.969]  Gentlemen, this is just so central.
[00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:28.213]  The entire crew, our reporters, everybody, our listeners, we all have to be involved.
[00:22:28.253 --> 00:22:29.834]  We have to be very aggressive.
[00:22:30.194 --> 00:22:34.697]  We have to understand that this country and the world is on a knife's edge.
[00:22:34.717 --> 00:22:35.538]  Does everyone have anything else?
[00:22:36.198 --> 00:22:38.761]  Well, they try to pin all this violence on conservatives.
[00:22:39.302 --> 00:22:43.807]  Like the attack that happened up in Washington State, they tried to say that was a conservative.
[00:22:43.867 --> 00:22:44.848]  No, it was a Bernie supporter.
[00:22:45.889 --> 00:22:50.755]  The recent shooting at the baseball field, that was a Bernie supporter also.
[00:22:51.135 --> 00:22:56.558]  There's articles out today, left-wing attacks are 30 plus to 1 for right-wing attacks.
[00:22:57.239 --> 00:22:58.379]  They basically don't exist.
[00:22:58.659 --> 00:23:02.522]  We've seen four or five ala Akbar attacks this week in the U.S.
[00:23:02.542 --> 00:23:06.844]  People getting stabbed, people blowing themselves up in Belgium at the train station.
[00:23:07.164 --> 00:23:14.769]  We're all just getting conditioned to leftist and Islamic terror while a bunch of mentally ill, spoiled brats all run around killing people.
[00:23:15.089 --> 00:23:18.454]  Well, like Sadiq Khan said, he wants it to be part and parcel of living in a big city.
[00:23:18.694 --> 00:23:22.740]  They want to condition us that dealing with terrorism is a new part of our daily lives.
[00:23:24.465 --> 00:23:25.065]  All right, gentlemen.
[00:23:25.206 --> 00:23:33.011]  Well, and then you got crazy people like this Ska person out in the EU from Germany, says we should bring entire villages into Germany.
[00:23:33.051 --> 00:23:36.834]  That will increase more migrants coming in because they'll have compatriots.
[00:23:37.734 --> 00:23:40.796]  It's total lunacy what these people are preaching over and over again.
[00:23:40.816 --> 00:23:41.757]  And that's all you have to do.
[00:23:41.777 --> 00:23:43.338]  You have to look at and go, this is crazy.
[00:23:43.859 --> 00:23:48.662]  Show people that it's crazy and try to deprogram some of these Hillary bots out there because that's the biggest problem.
[00:23:49.102 --> 00:24:06.388]  Is deprogramming these people because they've gone through a lot, they've accepted a lot, they're taking all this energy and just going out to the regular people and attacking them instead of going to the real seeds of power where we've taken it over halfway.
[00:24:07.288 --> 00:24:11.509]  If we let them continue what they're doing in the deep state, and Trump's got to do his part too.
[00:24:11.529 --> 00:24:12.550]  He's got to get rid of these people.
[00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:16.331]  They've got to have mass firings going on and just drain the swamp all at once.
[00:24:16.591 --> 00:24:17.832]  Hey, we can do with less government.
[00:24:18.112 --> 00:24:19.972]  I guarantee we can deal with less government.
[00:24:20.713 --> 00:24:23.033]  Gentlemen, let's get in there and let's start getting these videos out right now.
[00:24:23.293 --> 00:24:35.238]  The compilations of them calling for violence, the overthrow of Trump, the overthrow of the election, to just back up what Hannity's saying, because they're going for his job right now, because he is the one person on Fox News that has the courage to cover all this.
[00:24:35.258 --> 00:24:36.298]  Thank you so much, gentlemen.
[00:24:37.338 --> 00:24:45.605]  And I like Tucker Carlson, talked to him a couple days ago, and you know, he's doing great work, but those producers are keeping folks on a very, very short leash.
[00:24:46.565 --> 00:24:48.627]  And Hannity is telling the truth at his peril.
[00:24:49.087 --> 00:24:50.048]  Now let me just stop there.
[00:24:50.969 --> 00:24:58.315]  If you just tuned in, this social distortion, social upheaval is being engineered.
[00:24:58.375 --> 00:24:59.956]  That's admitted, that's declassified.
[00:25:02.307 --> 00:25:09.952]  Criminal elements inside the government, the deep state, are working with the media with fake news and fake leaks to try to undermine Trump's recovery.
[00:25:10.012 --> 00:25:11.333]  That's really the big news.
[00:25:11.713 --> 00:25:14.315]  Not just Trump himself, but the Trump recovery.
[00:25:14.635 --> 00:25:16.456]  We are under sabotage attack.
[00:25:17.857 --> 00:25:20.139]  This is so outrageous and here's the most important point.
[00:25:21.199 --> 00:25:23.681]  They're not going to just try to remove Trump now.
[00:25:23.921 --> 00:25:26.042]  They know culturally they're losing.
[00:25:26.523 --> 00:25:28.024]  They know Americanism
[00:25:29.264 --> 00:25:31.424]  Versus globalism, there's no choice.
[00:25:31.444 --> 00:25:33.485]  People are going to go with Americana and prosperity.
[00:25:34.185 --> 00:25:40.826]  Not with austerity and poverty and social unrest and brainwashing and engineered racism and all this other crud.
[00:25:40.946 --> 00:25:43.546]  People have broken with the globalist bullies.
[00:25:44.066 --> 00:25:48.127]  People started breaking with this modern new world order system decades ago.
[00:25:48.507 --> 00:25:53.168]  So they intimidated people, they lied about folks, they called people racist, conspiracy theorists.
[00:25:53.688 --> 00:25:57.609]  They did all sorts of horrible things, setting people up, railroading folks into prison.
[00:25:57.949 --> 00:25:58.909]  It didn't work.
[00:26:00.512 --> 00:26:02.994]  And now globally, it's spreading exponentially.
[00:26:03.214 --> 00:26:09.059]  And their big computer programs that Bezos and Apple and Google and all of them have, know that.
[00:26:09.179 --> 00:26:11.661]  And they admit that in their own elite publications.
[00:26:11.701 --> 00:26:15.665]  That global government's falling, that they're in crisis, and this is their last stand.
[00:26:17.486 --> 00:26:18.207]  They understand that.
[00:26:20.287 --> 00:26:22.209]  The old global elite is being swept away.
[00:26:22.449 --> 00:26:24.832]  We're about to set the table for the new world.
[00:26:25.452 --> 00:26:30.657]  Not their fake old world order, they call it a new world order, but a true shot at a future.
[00:26:30.878 --> 00:26:38.405]  The world's got so much uncertainty and so many problems and nanotech and GMO and AI and population explosions and all of this.
[00:26:38.665 --> 00:26:42.709]  We need to have good people focused, working hard if we've got any future.
[00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:49.717]  And it doesn't mean there aren't going to be some tough decisions, and some big wars, and a lot of other things we're going to have to make decisions on.
[00:26:50.258 --> 00:26:59.127]  But we don't need a bunch of globalist, spirit-cooking, devil-worshipping, lazy New World Order fops in control of this thing.
[00:26:59.168 --> 00:26:59.908]  They need to go.
[00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.111]  We need to politically burn them down.
[00:27:03.131 --> 00:27:05.192]  And they know we're burning them down.
[00:27:06.073 --> 00:27:07.913]  They knew the power of the info war.
[00:27:08.334 --> 00:27:12.696]  Seven years ago, Time Magazine called me the wild prophet of the Tea Party.
[00:27:13.216 --> 00:27:17.978]  And it said from my mountain I was preaching the message that was spreading like a disease.
[00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:20.760]  CNN calls me a virus.
[00:27:21.971 --> 00:27:23.012]  This isn't a power trip.
[00:27:23.252 --> 00:27:25.855]  We have to recognize the spirit they hate.
[00:27:26.296 --> 00:27:26.756]  You have it.
[00:27:27.097 --> 00:27:27.437]  I have it.
[00:27:27.697 --> 00:27:28.258]  You can be black.
[00:27:28.298 --> 00:27:28.739]  You can be white.
[00:27:28.759 --> 00:27:29.199]  You can be gold.
[00:27:29.219 --> 00:27:29.680]  You can be young.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.801]  You can be male, female.
[00:27:31.181 --> 00:27:35.987]  If you want liberty and you don't want to be a slave, and you want human freedom, that's the spirit.
[00:27:37.488 --> 00:27:38.690]  And they don't like that spirit.
[00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:40.632]  They can feel that spirit growing.
[00:27:40.972 --> 00:27:42.033]  I can feel it right now.
[00:27:42.434 --> 00:27:43.275]  It's powerful.
[00:27:44.616 --> 00:27:45.496]  They're jealous of it.
[00:27:46.136 --> 00:27:46.677]  It's true.
[00:27:46.757 --> 00:27:47.317]  It's honorable.
[00:27:47.357 --> 00:27:47.837]  It's focused.
[00:27:48.017 --> 00:27:48.557]  It's strong.
[00:27:48.697 --> 00:27:49.958]  It's full of creativity and life.
[00:27:50.258 --> 00:27:53.719]  It's also full of death and war when it comes to fighting evil.
[00:27:54.079 --> 00:27:54.679]  And they hate it.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.881]  A patriot is a thousand times the man one of these snakes are.
[00:28:01.121 --> 00:28:05.742]  Now, that said, Colonel Schaefer has warned of this a month ago.
[00:28:05.802 --> 00:28:07.643]  Now he says they're attacking on purpose.
[00:28:07.963 --> 00:28:09.524]  It's meant to elicit a response.
[00:28:09.964 --> 00:28:10.544]  Civil war.
[00:28:11.721 --> 00:28:15.862]  Kennedy comes out, says Deep State is moving to overthrow the Republic and overthrow the President.
[00:28:16.082 --> 00:28:18.963]  They don't want that said until they launch operations.
[00:28:19.143 --> 00:28:25.665]  They want to build up and get ready and try to get all their cowardly forces lined up to believe they can get away with it.
[00:28:26.305 --> 00:28:32.767]  That's why they denied they tried to steal the nomination and they tried to deny that they tried to steal the delegates, which they all got caught doing.
[00:28:33.367 --> 00:28:35.387]  Deny, deny, deny is a military tactic.
[00:28:36.568 --> 00:28:40.649]  World War I, the Germans would broadcast, you know, over their bullhorns.
[00:28:42.093 --> 00:28:42.894]  The war is over.
[00:28:42.994 --> 00:28:43.374]  Give up.
[00:28:43.434 --> 00:28:47.437]  We are your friends as they come over the top with their bayonets and stick them into you and vice versa.
[00:28:47.777 --> 00:28:48.737]  It's propaganda.
[00:28:49.218 --> 00:28:49.838]  It's lies.
[00:28:49.858 --> 00:28:52.240]  So here's Colonel Schaefer.
[00:28:54.565 --> 00:28:58.567]  If you had something to say about someone, I don't think you'd be trying to go through your staff to say it.
[00:28:58.827 --> 00:29:01.529]  I think if you felt a certain way, you would tell that person.
[00:29:01.849 --> 00:29:05.191]  Why do we believe that James Comey would want this leaked out?
[00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:14.976]  I think that this is something being done by those in the deep state to upset everything that's going on, and like you said, try to undermine the president in every breath.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.702]  And we're going to play the full clip coming up later where he breaks down.
[00:29:20.742 --> 00:29:23.465]  It's an information war, how this is all working.
[00:29:23.505 --> 00:29:29.150]  Now when we come back, Hannity lays it all out Tuesday and the Washington Post says they want him fired.
[00:29:29.851 --> 00:29:30.952]  They say, you better watch it.
[00:29:30.992 --> 00:29:32.013]  We almost got you fired.
[00:29:32.053 --> 00:29:33.054]  We'll get you fired again.
[00:29:33.274 --> 00:29:37.498]  This is the CIA, criminal elements of it, with 600 million in taxpayer money.
[00:29:38.928 --> 00:29:41.331]  I mean, the Washington Post is mainly spooks.
[00:29:41.611 --> 00:29:41.971]  Mainly.
[00:29:42.392 --> 00:29:49.319]  If you work at the Washington Post, in politics, your usual naval intelligence, army intelligence, CIA, you name it.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.541]  And they're all leftist handpicked.
[00:29:52.863 --> 00:29:53.744]  We're on the march.
[00:29:54.244 --> 00:29:55.866]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.767 --> 00:29:59.470]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:08.604 --> 00:30:09.965]  Welcome back to Brain Fight.
[00:30:10.125 --> 00:30:11.686]  I'm the real Tuck Buckford.
[00:30:12.186 --> 00:30:18.870]  And coming up this Thursday, I'm going to be in Alex Jones' face, showing the world what a traitor and an enemy he is.
[00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:22.212]  Let's look at another dried lizard penis.
[00:30:22.412 --> 00:30:23.652]  Why, that's Bill Clinton.
[00:30:23.872 --> 00:30:24.353]  Yogurt.
[00:30:26.114 --> 00:30:28.035]  Tuck Buckford don't like Alex Jones.
[00:30:28.235 --> 00:30:30.056]  I want to bring up my next guest.
[00:30:31.345 --> 00:30:39.610]  Donald John Trump, he's been on the show before and all of it's gonna be brought to you by CBS and that little angel Stephen Colbert.
[00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:46.034]  So join me this Thursday for the real brain fight during the Alex Jones Show 11 a.m.
[00:30:46.074 --> 00:30:46.734]  to 2 p.m.
[00:30:46.794 --> 00:30:49.236]  Central at that traitorous evil website.
[00:30:49.596 --> 00:30:53.458]  None of you should visit Infowars.com.
[00:30:53.718 --> 00:30:55.900]  This is not violent at all, but I do this to Trump.
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.801]  Just do what CBS wants, that's good.
[00:30:58.261 --> 00:30:59.262]  I'm gonna do whatever my...
[00:31:03.703 --> 00:31:07.225]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:31:07.685 --> 00:31:13.727]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:31:14.147 --> 00:31:16.928]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:17.308 --> 00:31:20.329]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:20.529 --> 00:31:23.971]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:31:24.311 --> 00:31:24.751]  The left
[00:31:25.111 --> 00:31:26.052]  ...controls culture.
[00:31:26.072 --> 00:31:27.053]  They control art.
[00:31:27.133 --> 00:31:28.355]  They control entertainment.
[00:31:28.655 --> 00:31:35.743]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:35.783 --> 00:31:38.205]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:31:38.686 --> 00:31:42.550]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.652]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[00:31:45.293 --> 00:31:50.660]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:57.168]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:31:57.248 --> 00:31:58.950]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:31:59.091 --> 00:32:00.272]  It's available right now.
[00:32:00.593 --> 00:32:02.775]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:03.604 --> 00:32:12.606]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:32:12.686 --> 00:32:20.928]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:32:21.089 --> 00:32:25.790]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:29.631]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:31.651]  We're good to go!
[00:32:54.821 --> 00:33:00.963]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:33:01.123 --> 00:33:02.843]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:33:06.925 --> 00:33:09.125]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:09.625 --> 00:33:14.727]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:18.596 --> 00:33:35.684]  Let's start with this, what appears to be a memo to file by the FBI director that conveys a one-person view of what happened in a conversation with at least one other person, the president.
[00:33:36.205 --> 00:33:37.125]  What do you make of this?
[00:33:37.505 --> 00:33:45.209]  Well, further than that, Lew, let me read to you the article from MSNBC saying neither NBC News nor The Times has seen the actual memo.
[00:33:46.118 --> 00:33:46.578]  Think about that.
[00:33:47.119 --> 00:33:53.686]  They're reporting that someone whispered to them about a memo that may or may not exist in somebody's file at the FBI.
[00:33:54.206 --> 00:33:57.750]  This is truly deep state, and you have collusion.
[00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.893]  I mean, this passes for reporting?
[00:34:01.994 --> 00:34:03.175]  This is beyond insane.
[00:34:04.277 --> 00:34:09.422]  And Lou, what you said here, walking up to it, I think illustrates clearly what the issue is regarding the president.
[00:34:09.722 --> 00:34:14.344]  The president did actually ask Mr. Comey to do something.
[00:34:15.225 --> 00:34:18.006]  And that thing he asked him to do was, do your job.
[00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:19.627]  Investigate the leaks.
[00:34:20.207 --> 00:34:34.074]  And instead of doing that, and being asked by Trey Gowdy the same thing, expressing no interest at all in actually doing his job to investigate leaks, which by the way did compromise techniques and procedures of how we do collection.
[00:34:34.834 --> 00:34:39.356]  It was an arrogance about him that said, basically, I can pick and choose what I want to do.
[00:34:39.716 --> 00:34:49.281]  So this is another example of that, where you have people... And by the way, Lou, just between you and me, if you had something to say about someone, I don't think you'd be trying to go through your staff to say it.
[00:34:49.541 --> 00:34:52.782]  I think if you felt a certain way, you would tell that person.
[00:34:52.942 --> 00:34:55.923]  Why do we believe that James Comey would want this leaked out?
[00:34:56.224 --> 00:35:03.927]  I think that this is something being done by those in the deep state to upset everything that's going on, and like you said, try to undermine the president,
[00:35:05.128 --> 00:35:05.708]  In every breath.
[00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:13.595]  We're in an information war with a deep state criminally operating and 600 million dollars was given by the CIA.
[00:35:15.517 --> 00:35:25.885]  As soon as Trump won the November 8th election, 600 million dollars, that was in the Associated Press, was given by Obama, your money, to the Washington Post.
[00:35:25.925 --> 00:35:28.608]  And you wonder why they make the New York Times look truthful?
[00:35:30.029 --> 00:35:30.809]  They are the worst.
[00:35:31.786 --> 00:35:37.707]  And they wrote a big article by Eric Wimple, who's a special little operator against this country.
[00:35:38.107 --> 00:35:38.487]  Literally.
[00:35:39.187 --> 00:35:39.567]  Literally!
[00:35:40.608 --> 00:35:44.228]  Fox News' Sean Hannity is encroaching on Alex Jones' territory.
[00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:52.590]  And then he goes through and says, Hannity almost got fired for the made-up Seth Rich story.
[00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:53.130]  Really?
[00:35:53.310 --> 00:36:00.571]  An unsolved murder of a key DNC staffer, who we have evidence was the main leaker, being shot in the back, execution style, and not robbed?
[00:36:01.966 --> 00:36:09.035]  And the family did get a PI at first and all this happened and then suddenly clearly got threatened or something and backed off and they said, how dare you hurt the family?
[00:36:13.941 --> 00:36:14.182]  Then...
[00:36:16.854 --> 00:36:18.835]  They go, he's getting it from Alex Jones.
[00:36:19.255 --> 00:36:23.318]  Jones says there's a COG plan to overturn the election and overthrow Trump.
[00:36:23.798 --> 00:36:36.506]  Yeah, I read it in the Financial Times of London, Atlantic Monthly, the New Yorker Magazine, and I watched politicians talk about it and say impeach Trump and say kill him and say kill his supporters.
[00:36:36.886 --> 00:36:41.089]  And then I witnessed it happening and I witnessed congressmen and police being shot.
[00:36:42.017 --> 00:36:49.343]  And I witnessed Trump saying, let's have a moment of silence and send our prayers to Scalise that finally isn't in critical condition.
[00:36:49.563 --> 00:36:50.344]  He's in stable.
[00:36:52.205 --> 00:36:53.486]  Shot him with a high-powered rifle.
[00:36:56.269 --> 00:36:58.791]  Thank God the demon Libtard, you know, wasn't a good shot.
[00:37:00.432 --> 00:37:01.653]  And they all boo.
[00:37:02.474 --> 00:37:06.197]  The protesters go, no, boo!
[00:37:06.237 --> 00:37:07.678]  We don't send prayers!
[00:37:07.938 --> 00:37:08.579]  Boo!
[00:37:08.619 --> 00:37:09.399]  We hope he dies!
[00:37:12.827 --> 00:37:13.447]  That's coming up!
[00:37:14.908 --> 00:37:18.430]  And then they talk to the Washington Post readers like they're complete idiots.
[00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:26.574]  When right out of the Deep State's mouth comes this article saying Hannity needs to be fired and better watch himself.
[00:37:26.794 --> 00:37:31.956]  Kind of like Brennan the Wahhabist two days before Trump fired him saying, you ought to watch your mouth, President-elect.
[00:37:33.097 --> 00:37:35.298]  That's the arrogance of the Deep State and the elites.
[00:37:36.778 --> 00:37:39.900]  All bought off by all these multinationals and globalists.
[00:37:44.724 --> 00:37:49.006]  And Trump knew who was funding the Deep State, Saudi Arabia and China, so that's why he met with them first.
[00:37:49.306 --> 00:37:57.069]  He marched into Saudi Arabia, and he told them, we're going to level you if you don't back off and stop the Al-Qaeda and ISIS forces you're backing.
[00:38:00.091 --> 00:38:02.091]  You can have a carpet of bombs or a carpet of gold.
[00:38:03.012 --> 00:38:08.614]  And we'll give you weapons to fend off that are heavy weapons to be able to fight Iran, but we're not going to fund any more jihads.
[00:38:11.235 --> 00:38:12.176]  So here's the big news.
[00:38:13.413 --> 00:38:15.694]  We have to get this information out to everybody.
[00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:19.075]  Because they're scared of this information.
[00:38:19.435 --> 00:38:23.436]  They want to prepare all this and only have it in their elite publications to each other.
[00:38:23.796 --> 00:38:33.319]  And then when a little old country bumpkin like me from Texas goes, look, here they are rewriting the succession rules and admitting that Obama did a stay-behind network.
[00:38:33.639 --> 00:38:34.600]  They're going to try to overthrow Trump.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.300]  Remember the New York Times headlines?
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.401]  In fact, print me those please.
[00:38:38.121 --> 00:38:41.562]  Where it said, in final weeks in office,
[00:38:42.822 --> 00:38:47.926]  Obama is putting in as many people as he can into the bureaucracy to try to stop Trump.
[00:38:47.946 --> 00:38:48.687]  Remember those headlines?
[00:38:49.047 --> 00:38:51.549]  To try to stop Trump wrecking the country was how they spun it.
[00:38:51.909 --> 00:38:57.374]  Obama's hiring record numbers of people and putting them in the bureaucracy to try to stop Trump's agenda.
[00:38:58.547 --> 00:38:59.807]  And then there were other headlines.
[00:39:00.328 --> 00:39:06.530]  Yes, Obama is letting as much information as he can out to the press before Trump gets in.
[00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:08.390]  He's leaking as much info as he can.
[00:39:08.911 --> 00:39:10.311]  They were admitting all of it.
[00:39:10.511 --> 00:39:13.072]  And Trump said he thought it was Comey that was the leaker.
[00:39:13.432 --> 00:39:14.212]  And of course he was.
[00:39:14.973 --> 00:39:20.014]  Obama's last days aiding Trump transition by erecting policy roadblocks.
[00:39:20.395 --> 00:39:21.215]  The New York Times.
[00:39:22.594 --> 00:39:24.997]  So there they are putting the deep state in.
[00:39:25.017 --> 00:39:28.540]  That's never been done by another administration before with the next coming in.
[00:39:31.363 --> 00:39:42.075]  And then they tell us that we're insane and Sean Hannity needs to be fired because he said this on Tuesday night.
[00:39:43.766 --> 00:39:55.809]  Tonight, a soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office.
[00:39:56.329 --> 00:40:02.410]  Sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear and present danger.
[00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:04.971]  That is tonight's very important opening monologue.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:14.003]  All right, so here in America, we're at a turning point tonight with forces now forming an alliance to try and remove President Trump from office.
[00:40:14.103 --> 00:40:14.904]  It's that serious.
[00:40:15.284 --> 00:40:18.966]  Now, here are the five dangers we are facing, especially the president.
[00:40:19.146 --> 00:40:23.568]  One, you've got the destroy Trump media that has been lying to you now.
[00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:25.890]  Provable lies for 11 months.
[00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:26.510]  Non-stop.
[00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.292]  Trump-Russia collusion.
[00:40:28.632 --> 00:40:29.753]  Black helicopter theories.
[00:40:30.213 --> 00:40:31.935]  No evidence whatsoever.
[00:40:32.395 --> 00:40:34.537]  Two, you've got what I've been calling the deep state.
[00:40:34.897 --> 00:40:40.302]  Selectively leaking information to damage the president and anyone associated with him.
[00:40:41.162 --> 00:40:45.547]  3.
[00:40:41.583 --> 00:40:45.547]  Special Counsel Mueller's investigation mission creep I've been telling you about.
[00:40:45.948 --> 00:40:49.692]  Well, it's now turned into an out-of-control, what is a political witch hunt.
[00:40:50.093 --> 00:40:51.855]  It needs to be stopped.
[00:40:51.875 --> 00:40:51.855]  4.
[00:40:52.375 --> 00:41:01.486]  All this manufactured turmoil putting President Trump's agenda in jeopardy, which ends up directly impacting every one of you out there, the American people.
[00:41:01.966 --> 00:41:11.154]  And five, this effort to override the will of the American people, change the results of a presidential election, is now creating a national security crisis.
[00:41:11.734 --> 00:41:21.483]  America is now suffering from a massive informational crisis because, I call them the destroy Trump media, has routinely been exposed now.
[00:41:21.963 --> 00:41:28.668]  Agenda-driven propagandists, more than happy to push debunked tinfoil hat conspiracy theories.
[00:41:28.708 --> 00:41:37.635]  For example, the media relentlessly peddling one of the biggest lies in American history, that is, that the president colluded with the Russians.
[00:41:38.015 --> 00:41:43.619]  Now that's because members of the media are nothing more than left-wing ideologues pretending to be journalists.
[00:41:43.899 --> 00:41:48.242]  Remember, they're the ones that colluded with Hillary Clinton, exposed by WikiLeaks in the 2016 election.
[00:41:49.603 --> 00:41:57.207]  The media has one clear, shared goal in mind, and that is to damage, stop, and destroy Trump's presidency.
[00:41:57.607 --> 00:42:00.168]  Sadly, it appears by any means necessary.
[00:42:00.628 --> 00:42:05.691]  We have been highlighting right here on this program, night after night, just how unhinged these people have become.
[00:42:06.111 --> 00:42:18.397]  And they don't care about facts, obviously they don't care about the truth, which is why the Washington Post, the New York Times, ABC, NBC, CNN, all exposed as having gotten their reporting wrong.
[00:42:18.877 --> 00:42:24.741]  But the Destroy Trump Media, they're not the only ones whose collusion narrative, by the way, has completely crumbled.
[00:42:25.402 --> 00:42:31.926]  Take a list at the long list of Democrats admitting no evidence of collusion.
[00:42:32.286 --> 00:42:32.767]  Zero.
[00:42:33.047 --> 00:42:33.367]  Zip.
[00:42:33.948 --> 00:42:34.308]  Take a look.
[00:42:35.535 --> 00:42:46.045]  Well, you know, the allegation, of course, is that the Russians in the hacking and dumping of documents in the election had, essentially, relationships with Trump campaign people.
[00:42:46.426 --> 00:42:49.509]  But I'm not prepared to say that there's proof you could take to a jury.
[00:42:49.529 --> 00:42:53.513]  Do you agree with this conclusion that the president has reached, that there was no evidence of collusion?
[00:42:54.233 --> 00:42:57.076]  You know, we haven't seen any of that whatsoever, George.
[00:42:57.136 --> 00:43:00.679]  We've been looking and sewing everything that they possibly have.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.061]  We got connections with Hillary!
[00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:20.616]  The next threat, and perhaps the most dangerous, the deep state, that is the unelected, what I call the fourth branch of government, consisting of a lot of Obama holdovers, anti-Trump bureaucrats, who now are routinely targeting the president, his administration, with selective leaking to hurt him.
[00:43:21.056 --> 00:43:27.778]  Now, this deep state works closely with the destroyed Trump media to disseminate false information about the president and his administration.
[00:43:28.159 --> 00:43:37.342]  And what's even more dangerous, more sinister about the deep state is that they're willing to break the law, leaking classified information like in the case of General Flynn.
[00:43:37.862 --> 00:43:43.904]  And you have the former FBI director, James Comey, admitting under oath he had his memo leaked to the New York Times.
[00:43:43.924 --> 00:43:44.705]  He had a goal.
[00:43:45.025 --> 00:43:47.105]  He wanted the appointment of a special counsel.
[00:43:49.226 --> 00:43:50.547]  This is just unprecedented.
[00:43:50.567 --> 00:44:02.556]  Hannity, again, I talked to two people high up at Fox that are friends with Hannity, and he came out of those meetings three or four weeks ago and we said the word is he's going to be fired next week because he said, I believe I'll be fired next week.
[00:44:03.156 --> 00:44:10.722]  And then there was just so much pressure that they backed off and guaranteed they are thinking about firing him for what he just did.
[00:44:11.703 --> 00:44:13.864]  And if you read
[00:44:15.477 --> 00:44:23.700]  The article in the Washington Post, they speak from a position of authority, because this is the deep state, and they say, shut up or you're fired.
[00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:24.840]  In the article.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.381]  And stop quoting Alex Jones.
[00:44:29.722 --> 00:44:35.983]  And they know full, well, I mean, they're in briefing rooms, ladies and gentlemen, led by folks that have overthrown countries, okay?
[00:44:36.644 --> 00:44:43.646]  Funded by Soros, funded by Bezos, funded by the CIA, and they think you're so stupid that you won't type in
[00:44:45.512 --> 00:44:48.975]  Washington Post got $600 million from the CIA.
[00:44:49.215 --> 00:44:50.256]  That was in mainstream news!
[00:44:50.597 --> 00:44:53.339]  Even other mainstream media got jealous and reported on it.
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.001]  And said, maybe that crosses the line.
[00:44:56.102 --> 00:45:05.090]  Even that Charlie Wurzel guy from BuzzFeed that puts out near-fiction articles was on CNN this weekend when they were talking about banning me from the airwaves, period.
[00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:07.211]  He said, hey, wait, this sounds dangerous.
[00:45:07.632 --> 00:45:09.393]  Yeah, you bet it's dangerous, people!
[00:45:09.714 --> 00:45:10.835]  Just admit we're right!
[00:45:13.288 --> 00:45:15.849]  We're not the tinfoil hat wearers, you are!
[00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:17.609]  I've studied the government.
[00:45:17.949 --> 00:45:18.870]  I've studied history.
[00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.030]  I've changed the world with my listeners.
[00:45:22.851 --> 00:45:26.192]  And I don't say that from a power trip.
[00:45:26.532 --> 00:45:29.253]  I want more people getting it like Sean Hannity.
[00:45:29.373 --> 00:45:30.673]  I want to see everybody get it.
[00:45:31.833 --> 00:45:33.634]  I want to make it safe for you to tell the truth.
[00:45:34.354 --> 00:45:40.056]  I'm willing to step up and be annihilated, be destroyed, be drugged to the mud, be attacked, because that's what men do.
[00:45:40.836 --> 00:45:41.336]  To lead.
[00:45:45.043 --> 00:45:46.044]  But it's crazy.
[00:45:47.465 --> 00:45:54.170]  It's crazy that the CIA gave them $600 million two months before Obama left office.
[00:45:55.391 --> 00:45:58.393]  That's just one thing they did to overthrow this country!
[00:45:58.873 --> 00:46:00.314]  This is completely illegal!
[00:46:01.115 --> 00:46:05.198]  This country is in a total civil war right now with a bunch of scum!
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:10.483]  It's not like there's a civil war and we're fighting globalists and communism and socialism.
[00:46:10.683 --> 00:46:12.585]  We did it the peaceful way through the ballot box.
[00:46:13.285 --> 00:46:17.069]  We beat all their illegals voting, their dead people voting, all their crud.
[00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:23.602]  Major studies out that the voting machines gave Hillary a nine point advantage.
[00:46:23.982 --> 00:46:39.347]  They oversampled the polls nine to fifteen points for Democrats and still Trump just won four special elections when they poured more money into all four than they've ever done each subsequent race breaking every previous record.
[00:46:39.627 --> 00:46:43.609]  They hit us with everything they've got and we're crushing them!
[00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:46.091]  These scum don't give up easy.
[00:46:46.111 --> 00:46:47.652]  That's why Bezos looks so freaked out.
[00:46:48.053 --> 00:46:51.475]  He wants to mount America's head on the wall because he's got a little you-know-what.
[00:46:55.238 --> 00:46:56.900]  People are your enemy.
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:57.820]  They hate you.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.242]  They hate flyover country.
[00:46:59.582 --> 00:47:00.803]  They hate bitter clingers.
[00:47:01.043 --> 00:47:02.184]  They hate everybody.
[00:47:02.784 --> 00:47:03.565]  They hate each other.
[00:47:03.605 --> 00:47:05.627]  They are the scum of the wannabe elite.
[00:47:05.867 --> 00:47:07.328]  They are the filth of the planet.
[00:47:07.788 --> 00:47:11.011]  They are enemies of every single man, woman, and child on Earth.
[00:47:13.467 --> 00:47:15.188]  Democrats all over the place celebrated.
[00:47:15.268 --> 00:47:18.909]  Congressman Scalise and the cops and everybody else getting shot a few weeks ago.
[00:47:19.129 --> 00:47:19.729]  We can have a go.
[00:47:19.749 --> 00:47:25.852]  And Democratic strategists put out little hashtags, hunt Republicans and all this other crap.
[00:47:26.252 --> 00:47:28.813]  And you see their violence and they're all the voice saying kill everybody.
[00:47:29.793 --> 00:47:31.514]  And then Trump is at a rally yesterday.
[00:47:31.534 --> 00:47:35.515]  And there's, you know, a balcony of protesters that got in there.
[00:47:35.815 --> 00:47:36.396]  They let them in there.
[00:47:36.436 --> 00:47:36.896]  It's America.
[00:47:38.049 --> 00:47:39.569]  And the leftists won't let you be at their rallies.
[00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.051]  Won't let you into the inauguration and lie about the numbers.
[00:47:43.071 --> 00:47:46.912]  Remember they said nobody was there and showed when the gates opened in the morning and showed small crowds?
[00:47:47.012 --> 00:47:48.152]  Because you had to go through security?
[00:47:48.412 --> 00:47:52.353]  How many lies until you know they're the enemy media?
[00:47:52.493 --> 00:47:53.854]  They're the globalist media.
[00:47:54.014 --> 00:47:56.495]  The country has literally been hijacked by criminals.
[00:47:56.935 --> 00:48:02.977]  We have a face sucker on our face and Trump is like a doctor trying to remove it from our face.
[00:48:04.257 --> 00:48:07.138]  And it's tightening up around our neck going, you're not going to do it, you're not!
[00:48:08.899 --> 00:48:10.721]  Then it's saying to Hannity, we'll fire you!
[00:48:11.061 --> 00:48:12.662]  They're saying to me, we'll kill you!
[00:48:13.163 --> 00:48:14.804]  They're telling Trump, we'll get your family!
[00:48:15.044 --> 00:48:16.426]  And we're all saying, let's go!
[00:48:16.866 --> 00:48:20.869]  Not because we're tough guys, or looking for trouble, we can't bend over to these scum!
[00:48:24.332 --> 00:48:26.915]  They don't want to make a deal with us folks, they want us gone!
[00:48:28.216 --> 00:48:32.940]  Because we're stronger than them, we're better looking than them, we're more honorable than them, and they know it.
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.981]  That's all I ever tell Trump on the telephone.
[00:48:38.001 --> 00:48:39.402]  I'm going to say, they're coming after you.
[00:48:39.742 --> 00:48:40.723]  They're never going to stop.
[00:48:40.763 --> 00:48:41.703]  They hate what you're doing.
[00:48:41.983 --> 00:48:44.285]  I know you're going to deliver on TPP.
[00:48:44.325 --> 00:48:46.306]  I know you're going to deliver on NAFTA and GATT.
[00:48:46.326 --> 00:48:48.347]  I know you're going to deliver on the carbon tax.
[00:48:48.387 --> 00:48:51.689]  I know you're going to deliver on the tax cut and they can't let America return.
[00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:54.510]  You've got to go to war with them now because they're at war with you.
[00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:57.092]  And that's the same message I'm making everybody right now.
[00:48:57.452 --> 00:48:59.853]  Information warfare, financial warfare.
[00:49:00.554 --> 00:49:01.534]  That's how we're beating them.
[00:49:01.594 --> 00:49:02.555]  Intensify efforts.
[00:49:02.595 --> 00:49:03.896]  The real war is now.
[00:49:04.936 --> 00:49:08.137]  The election was just the vanguard hitting the beach, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:08.437 --> 00:49:10.497]  We're now in deep in the enemy territory.
[00:49:10.737 --> 00:49:13.078]  We've got to move forward and go after them.
[00:49:13.518 --> 00:49:22.480]  This is the scum of the earth that here's the president say, and now let's have a moment of silence for Congressman Scalise and the others that were shot.
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.660]  He took a bullet for us all.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.581]  No, boo!
[00:49:29.581 --> 00:49:30.401]  This is the enemy.
[00:49:30.441 --> 00:49:31.442]  This is the scum.
[00:49:31.842 --> 00:49:32.522]  They hate us.
[00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:33.042]  Here it is.
[00:49:35.754 --> 00:49:51.626]  I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend, somebody that I've gotten to know very well, Steve Scalise, and everyone recovering from the assault.
[00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:08.982]  Never fails.
[00:50:11.228 --> 00:50:11.969]  Never fails.
[00:50:13.253 --> 00:50:15.618]  Disruptive, lazy, stupid people.
[00:50:17.383 --> 00:50:39.068]  They don't want to go to Venezuela or North Korea, they want to sit here in what was the wealthiest country in the world, with the biggest middle class, and complain, and gripe, and bitch, and say, kill people, and murder, and let's ally with Islam, and let's do that, and weirdo feminist, and shutting down colleges like Evergreen, because a professor said you can't ban whites from the campus, that's racist, and so they want him fired.
[00:50:40.967 --> 00:50:42.447]  People say, oh, this is out of control.
[00:50:42.527 --> 00:50:43.608]  It's designed that way.
[00:50:43.828 --> 00:50:45.888]  The universities have been set up to bring the country down.
[00:50:46.288 --> 00:50:49.969]  But we contained them, and so instead they're imploding themselves.
[00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:50.570]  Good!
[00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:53.731]  Let the enemy's own poison bring them down!
[00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:59.432]  We have the strength, we have the will, we have the destiny, we have the history, and we have God!
[00:51:00.072 --> 00:51:02.373]  Victory is ours if we simply press the attack!
[00:51:04.395 --> 00:51:13.181]  Supporters of Infowars, not just here in the U.S., but around the world, are the cutting-edge vanguard of the reawakening of a sleeping giant that is human liberty.
[00:51:15.959 --> 00:51:18.700]  Again, I want to thank you all humbly for fighting the globalists.
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.221]  I want to thank you for your financial support.
[00:51:20.601 --> 00:51:25.663]  You're the reasons we're still here and growing in the face of an unprecedented onslaught.

[00:52:42.298 --> 00:52:57.402]  This July 4th, celebrating our republic, celebrating worldwide freedom, and celebrating returning America to its place in the world as a true shining city on a hill, where people want to come here to celebrate free market and an open society,
[00:52:57.742 --> 00:53:03.746]  Not to celebrate a globalist, politically correct cesspool of infighting and mind control.
[00:53:04.086 --> 00:53:11.190]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:24.758]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality, known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[00:53:25.698 --> 00:53:36.942]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[00:53:37.602 --> 00:53:43.544]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[00:54:17.532 --> 00:54:18.352]  Learn from history.
[00:54:18.992 --> 00:54:20.633]  And that doesn't just mean ancient history.
[00:54:21.593 --> 00:54:22.393]  Or distant history.
[00:54:22.813 --> 00:54:24.553]  But what happened just a month ago or a year ago?
[00:54:24.573 --> 00:54:25.633]  Or five years ago?
[00:54:26.554 --> 00:54:27.194]  Twenty years ago?
[00:54:28.694 --> 00:54:30.154]  Why do they hate Infowars so much?
[00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:33.595]  Not because it discredits people and discredits the Liberty Movement.
[00:54:34.295 --> 00:54:34.495]  No.
[00:54:35.175 --> 00:54:39.096]  They always say that, hoping you believe that and then moderate what you're doing.
[00:54:39.876 --> 00:54:42.516]  Barry Goldwater, who tried to defeat this 60 years ago.
[00:54:43.896 --> 00:54:45.057]  We wouldn't even be here without him.
[00:54:45.937 --> 00:54:46.537]  He wrote the book.
[00:54:47.921 --> 00:54:54.365]  And made the statement that extremism and defense of liberty is no vice.
[00:54:55.245 --> 00:55:03.690]  We're faced with globalists bringing in 10 million, the UN put the numbers out two days ago, 10 million Islamic refugees to Canada, the US, and Europe in the last five years.
[00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:07.031]  I was saying six, seven million from the numbers I'd seen.
[00:55:07.051 --> 00:55:08.252]  10 million!
[00:55:08.872 --> 00:55:10.113]  Most of them military-age men.
[00:55:10.493 --> 00:55:11.414]  That's suicidal!
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:18.343]  German government is announcing plans to turn whole cities into Muslims and transplant whole towns there.
[00:55:20.665 --> 00:55:24.827]  Because the Germans are refusing to go along with it.
[00:55:26.768 --> 00:55:29.490]  It's incredible, folks, the news I've got coming up in the next hour.
[00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:31.051]  This is all suicidal.
[00:55:32.628 --> 00:56:00.388]  So I'm here saying, we're under enemy attack, they plan to overthrow the president, here's where they set it, here's their plan, and they go, oh no, no, that's just crazy, don't listen to him, because they don't want the opposition forming, and they don't want the normalization of reality so we can have a real debate about, look at these sore loser criminals, allied with radical orthodox Islam, wanting to overthrow free market, cut off our energy, sell out our industry to one-sided deals,
[00:56:01.573 --> 00:56:07.436]  Attack Christianity, sexualize children, to wreck us, to control us, to conquer us!
[00:56:09.077 --> 00:56:17.642]  Joe Rogan had the professor on from Evergreen University in Washington State, who is a liberal, big liberal, big SJW.
[00:56:18.162 --> 00:56:26.927]  He's a Brett Weinstein biology professor, and they said, yeah, no whites are going to be allowed this weekend at the school, you know, a few weeks ago, and we've covered this ad nauseum.
[00:56:28.701 --> 00:56:35.923]  And Tim and Joseph, they're in a very powerful multi-hour interview I watched the other day, but there's some shorter clips I'm going to play coming up later in the broadcast.
[00:56:36.664 --> 00:56:38.104]  And they go, we can't believe they're so dumb.
[00:56:38.144 --> 00:56:38.844]  They're eating their own.
[00:56:38.864 --> 00:56:39.665]  They're turning on themselves.
[00:56:39.865 --> 00:56:40.505]  It doesn't make sense.
[00:56:41.085 --> 00:56:45.087]  I have all the textbooks and all the documents, and I guarantee you Weinstein knows about leftist ideology.
[00:56:45.367 --> 00:56:52.149]  They want to create wrecked, mindless, gibbering people with chips on their shoulders so they can be politically controlled.
[00:56:54.076 --> 00:57:02.041]  And they meant to weaponize the colleges to then send out these people to be the managers of things to create more division in the country.
[00:57:02.241 --> 00:57:12.307]  But because Liberty Lovers contained this disease of leftist garbage and brainwashing, it's now destroying itself because it's all pinned in with itself.
[00:57:12.667 --> 00:57:14.528]  The vampires don't have any blood.
[00:57:14.769 --> 00:57:15.469]  They're together.
[00:57:18.211 --> 00:57:20.232]  So the weapons system malfunctioned.
[00:57:20.572 --> 00:57:21.913]  It blew up on the launch pad.
[00:57:24.628 --> 00:57:25.409]  Yeah!
[00:57:25.529 --> 00:57:26.310]  Yeah!
[00:57:26.751 --> 00:57:28.393]  Yeah!
[00:57:29.354 --> 00:57:32.337]  I'm sorry for the zombos, but they got pinned in.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.202]  He said it's a cult.
[00:57:37.623 --> 00:57:40.246]  He says, oh, it just developed on this one campus.
[00:57:40.306 --> 00:57:41.227]  No, it's in the textbooks.
[00:57:41.468 --> 00:57:43.190]  It's in the plan by psych warfare chiefs.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:50.683]  I mean, films showing where in the 60s they said they'd have 50 different sexes and depopulation and destroy the family.
[00:57:50.843 --> 00:57:53.544]  Hell, Huxley wrote in 1932 the whole plan.
[00:57:53.704 --> 00:57:57.585]  His brother was the global head eugenicist and the founder of transhumanism.
[00:57:57.826 --> 00:57:59.986]  But they don't transhuman you to make you better.
[00:58:00.166 --> 00:58:01.887]  They trans you until you're dead.
[00:58:02.948 --> 00:58:03.588]  Go read his book!
[00:58:06.974 --> 00:58:08.675]  Brave New World revisited non-fiction.
[00:58:08.775 --> 00:58:12.378]  It's all written by them like you're so stupid you won't read it!
[00:58:12.678 --> 00:58:13.499]  It's a plan!
[00:58:13.719 --> 00:58:14.700]  It's not my opinion!
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.201]  I am correct!
[00:58:16.521 --> 00:58:17.902]  That's why they hate me!
[00:58:18.183 --> 00:58:22.906]  They're a guild of sociopaths and psychopaths that think they own you and your family!
[00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:27.290]  They think you're too stupid when the vampire tells you he's coming in your house, you let him in!
[00:58:28.382 --> 00:58:30.924]  I didn't plug anything this hour and I need funding in this war!
[00:58:31.364 --> 00:58:35.207]  I've got incredible products, free shipping right now, 30-40% off a bunch of stuff.
[00:58:35.428 --> 00:58:36.809]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:36.969 --> 00:58:39.911]  We need the funds to expand and be strong in the face of the globalists.
[00:58:40.091 --> 00:58:43.014]  We didn't get $600 million from the CIA like the Washington Post.
[00:58:43.274 --> 00:58:45.936]  We just need a few million every month to crush the enemy!
[00:58:46.416 --> 00:58:47.778]  Infowarsstore.com!
[00:58:48.098 --> 00:58:48.958]  We need weapons!
[00:58:49.139 --> 00:58:50.880]  We need information warfare weapons!
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:52.761]  We need war bonds now!
[00:58:53.622 --> 00:58:59.446]  Donald Trump just held a rally in Iowa, and one of the people in attendance, our anonymous sources say, was Bill Clinton.
[00:58:59.506 --> 00:59:00.807]  Well, how do we know it was Bill Clinton?
[00:59:00.847 --> 00:59:10.833]  Because while Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise and the other three Americans who were shot at the ball field by a deranged Bernie supporter, Democratic operatives began blowing their Bill Clinton rape whistles.
[00:59:11.113 --> 00:59:16.636]  I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend.
[00:59:17.797 --> 00:59:21.198]  Somebody that I've gotten to know very well, Steve Scalise.
[00:59:21.678 --> 00:59:21.878]  Right?
[00:59:21.918 --> 00:59:27.920]  Because that's the only reason you would try to interrupt a president as he was sending out his thoughts and prayers to somebody who had recently been shot, right?
[00:59:27.941 --> 00:59:28.881]  Come on, work with me here.
[00:59:28.941 --> 00:59:31.102]  The Democrats can't even protest right.
[00:59:31.142 --> 00:59:32.322]  These people fail at everything.
[00:59:32.362 --> 00:59:36.403]  They lose elections, they lose public support, and now they look like thoughtless cowards.
[00:59:36.663 --> 00:59:37.624]  It's just as Trump said.
[00:59:37.644 --> 00:59:38.624]  Never fails.
[00:59:40.865 --> 00:59:41.265]  Never fails.
[00:59:41.889 --> 00:59:43.691]  You can check out the video on InfoWars.com.
[00:59:43.731 --> 00:59:47.496]  Protesters blow whistles as Trump sends thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise.
[00:59:47.656 --> 00:59:49.258]  And that part about Bill Clinton being in the audience?
[00:59:49.498 --> 00:59:50.259]  That was fake news.
[00:59:50.539 --> 00:59:52.982]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:59:55.926 --> 01:00:00.010]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:00:00.531 --> 01:00:01.813]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.654 --> 01:00:19.158]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.198 --> 01:00:20.339]  No, it's my new theme song.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:25.084]  It's true.
[01:00:25.384 --> 01:00:30.469]  That was real sweet.
[01:00:30.509 --> 01:00:32.451]  Now I kick tyrants in the teeth!
[01:00:33.391 --> 01:00:37.775]  Yeah!
[01:00:38.076 --> 01:00:39.177]  They can't be seen with me.
[01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:45.339]  And I'm feeling real shot down.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:50.922]  Yeah, it must have been bad 30, 40 years ago to have all the papers lying about you.
[01:00:51.402 --> 01:00:53.303]  But nowadays, people see that, they go, the enemy?
[01:00:53.423 --> 01:00:57.184]  The horrible, degenerate, pro-pedophile, pro-Islamic press?
[01:00:57.805 --> 01:00:58.865]  Does it like someone?
[01:01:00.766 --> 01:01:12.331]  I can fall on my face, have them totally edited, and it'd be the worst interview ever where I look like a wet, lobotomized walrus stammering and gibbering after being led from the surgical table.
[01:01:16.181 --> 01:01:18.021]  And they say her career's over.
[01:01:18.501 --> 01:01:21.662]  Worst ratings ever, worst ratings of the day, not just in that time slot.
[01:01:22.862 --> 01:01:23.262]  She's done.
[01:01:25.963 --> 01:01:27.903]  I'm not bragging, but that's what happened with Piers Morgan.
[01:01:27.923 --> 01:01:31.744]  The fact that on Mainline News, even Megyn Kelly said, yeah, Piers Morgan's career was over after that interview.
[01:01:31.764 --> 01:01:35.925]  It was the top news fight of the year, according to major polls.
[01:01:36.645 --> 01:01:37.845]  And everybody said I lost the debate.
[01:01:37.885 --> 01:01:38.225]  No, I didn't.
[01:01:39.405 --> 01:01:42.706]  I information warfare bombed them, like a suicide bomber.
[01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:44.089]  That's what I do.
[01:01:44.129 --> 01:01:45.090]  I blow myself up.
[01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:48.612]  And then like the Phoenix, I'm arisen again every day in the archetype.
[01:01:48.632 --> 01:01:50.633]  Because I don't care.
[01:01:50.653 --> 01:01:52.554]  I don't care what you say about me.
[01:01:52.574 --> 01:01:53.434]  I don't care what you do to me.
[01:01:53.474 --> 01:01:54.615]  I don't care if you spit on me.
[01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:55.836]  Laugh at me.
[01:01:55.916 --> 01:01:56.556]  I know I'm right.
[01:01:56.976 --> 01:01:58.597]  And I know you are failing.
[01:02:02.199 --> 01:02:05.861]  So... I don't take any pleasure in that.
[01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:12.011]  Narcissistic tart circling the proverbial bowl.
[01:02:12.811 --> 01:02:21.773]  I take pleasure in the corporate snakes up above her that thought they could take her after she went into the radiation chamber with Trump and he roasted her.
[01:02:22.333 --> 01:02:23.673]  She was cooked already.
[01:02:24.093 --> 01:02:33.535]  Then she stumbled over to NBC, fell flat on her face, and the bad ratings began to sink like a lead balloon into oblivion.
[01:02:35.816 --> 01:02:37.056]  I smell failure.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:48.988]  That's why they keep telling the lemmings in all their news articles, Jones is failing, Jones is failing, Trump's failing, everything's failing, the economy's failing, oh gosh, Jones is over, Jones is defeated, it's over, it's over, they're all defeated, they're all defeated, Sean Hannity's gonna get fired.
[01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:55.332]  All this stuff's going on, on and on and on and on and on.
[01:02:55.933 --> 01:02:56.433]  It's amazing.
[01:02:56.453 --> 01:03:01.557]  Let's go to some of Sean Hannity, some more of that powerful 10-minute breakdown he did of the whole martial law program.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.762]  An example is the unmasking of General Flynn.
[01:03:05.062 --> 01:03:07.684]  That was a violation of the Espionage Act.
[01:03:07.744 --> 01:03:08.464]  That's a crime.
[01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:09.785]  That's a felony, by the way.
[01:03:10.426 --> 01:03:14.369]  And then Flynn's Fourth Amendment rights, by the way, totally trampled on.
[01:03:14.809 --> 01:03:15.790]  You've heard nothing about it.
[01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:17.071]  There's no investigation there.
[01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:17.811]  Why?
[01:03:17.831 --> 01:03:19.612]  Again, the deep state, they don't care.
[01:03:19.632 --> 01:03:23.815]  They're only concerned with taking down President Trump and President Trump's associates.
[01:03:24.176 --> 01:03:26.097]  Then you've got number three, the special counsel.
[01:03:26.437 --> 01:03:28.499]  Look at Mueller's investigation mission creep.
[01:03:28.879 --> 01:03:31.561]  Remember, President Trump has called this the greatest political
[01:03:31.801 --> 01:03:35.063]  Well, I'm here to tell you, the President's right.
[01:03:35.504 --> 01:03:40.027]  Mueller's sole purpose was to investigate so-called Trump-Russia collusion.
[01:03:40.387 --> 01:03:48.192]  But Mueller is now expanding that investigation, and he's digging into finances and Jared Kushner and obstruction of justice.
[01:03:48.833 --> 01:03:49.413]  And guess what?
[01:03:49.853 --> 01:03:51.014]  He's not going to stop there.
[01:03:51.234 --> 01:03:51.434]  Why?
[01:03:51.454 --> 01:03:54.837]  Because there is no Trump-Russia collusion, so he has to move on to other things.
[01:03:55.197 --> 01:03:56.898]  And I'll tell you what's most alarming about this.
[01:03:56.978 --> 01:03:59.840]  Mueller is having massive conflicts of interest.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.301]  He should recuse himself.
[01:04:01.681 --> 01:04:05.182]  He's incapable of carrying out a fair and impartial investigation.
[01:04:05.622 --> 01:04:08.703]  Now, Mueller needs to end this witch hunt right now.
[01:04:09.064 --> 01:04:10.584]  He's best friends with James Comey.
[01:04:10.944 --> 01:04:13.425]  The two have been best friends for a long time.
[01:04:14.025 --> 01:04:19.527]  And who do you think Mueller is going to side with when it comes to the President and his word versus James Comey's word?
[01:04:19.847 --> 01:04:21.728]  That's pretty obvious, pretty unfair.
[01:04:22.288 --> 01:04:33.934]  And then there's the fact that members of Mueller's investigative team, the lawyers he's hiring, they've all, many of them, donated big, big bucks to, let's see, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton.
[01:04:34.314 --> 01:04:42.879]  And on top of that, perhaps most sinister, one of the lawyers Mueller has hired actually was Clinton's attorney at the Clinton Foundation.
[01:04:43.759 --> 01:04:44.879]  All right, that's enough.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.020]  It goes on and on.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.680]  It's so powerful, and they want him fired.
[01:04:48.441 --> 01:04:49.041]  It's incredible.
[01:04:49.101 --> 01:04:58.844]  And he exposes the plan that they're gearing up for a violent overthrow of the president and then a total shutdown of America because they know we're winning the information war, where we're winning peacefully.
[01:04:58.864 --> 01:05:00.925]  They want to overturn the table with violence.
[01:05:08.928 --> 01:05:10.289]  Welcome back to Brain Fight.
[01:05:10.449 --> 01:05:12.030]  I'm the real Tuck Buckford.
[01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:19.194]  And coming up this Thursday, I'm going to be in Alex Jones' face, showing the world what a traitor and an enemy he is.
[01:05:19.514 --> 01:05:22.536]  Let's look at another dried lizard penis.
[01:05:22.736 --> 01:05:23.976]  Why, that's Bill Clinton.
[01:05:24.196 --> 01:05:24.677]  Yogurt.
[01:05:26.438 --> 01:05:28.359]  Tuck Buckford don't like Alex Jones.
[01:05:28.559 --> 01:05:30.380]  I want to bring up my next guest.
[01:05:31.653 --> 01:05:39.939]  Donald John Trump, he's been on the show before and all of it's gonna be brought to you by CBS and that little angel Stephen Colbert.
[01:05:40.299 --> 01:05:46.363]  So join me this Thursday for the real brain fight during the Alex Jones Show 11 a.m.
[01:05:46.503 --> 01:05:47.043]  to 2 p.m.
[01:05:47.103 --> 01:05:49.565]  Central at that traitorous evil website.
[01:05:49.905 --> 01:05:53.788]  None of you should visit Infowars.com.
[01:05:54.028 --> 01:05:56.210]  This is not violent at all but I do this to Trump.
[01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:58.111]  Just do what CBS wants, that's good.
[01:05:58.571 --> 01:05:59.572]  I'm gonna do whatever my
[01:06:03.171 --> 01:06:13.236]  The supporters of Infowars, not just here in the U.S., but around the world, are the cutting-edge vanguard of the reawakening of a sleeping giant that is human liberty.
[01:06:16.013 --> 01:06:18.754]  Again, I want to thank you all humbly for fighting the globalists.
[01:06:18.794 --> 01:06:20.254]  I want to thank you for your financial support.

[01:07:42.348 --> 01:07:44.871]  This July 4th, celebrating our Republic,
[01:07:45.251 --> 01:08:03.722]  Celebrating worldwide freedom and celebrating returning America to its place in the world as a true shining city on a hill where people want to come here to celebrate free market and an open society, not to celebrate a globalist, politically correct cesspool of infighting and mind control.
[01:08:23.723 --> 01:08:24.584]  From the front lines.
[01:08:24.604 --> 01:08:27.626]  And we are the front line.
[01:08:28.967 --> 01:08:32.790]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:39.375]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[01:08:39.395 --> 01:08:49.163]  A new world order.
[01:08:49.203 --> 01:08:50.824]  Well, President Trump just tweeted out
[01:08:52.449 --> 01:08:59.837]  Whether there are tapes or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make and do not have any such recordings.
[01:09:01.018 --> 01:09:07.205]  And I guess there's an earlier tweet where he finishes that or starts it, but he's basically saying somebody might have taped it, but I didn't.
[01:09:09.247 --> 01:09:15.053]  And that's how he bluffed Comey into admitting the truth and got around the fake memo that they won't release.
[01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:34.960]  To get Comey to say no, he never tried to obstruct justice, he never asked me to do that, because Trump knew he hadn't done that, he knew they were lying, they knew he'd leaked a fake memo to say it, he understood the whole plan, and so he then bluffed Comey in his testimony into not lying.
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:45.627]  And that's why we have Comey not once but twice in front of Congress saying he, that is the President, never tried to obstruct justice.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:59.594]  Now, I don't usually spend an hour on one subject, but I did with what we were covering because the subject matter was so powerful.
[01:09:59.734 --> 01:10:04.419]  And I tell you, Sean Hannity's attacked me before, a decade or so ago.
[01:10:05.663 --> 01:10:07.225]  The media would misrepresent what I said.
[01:10:07.265 --> 01:10:08.266]  They'd take it out of context.
[01:10:08.346 --> 01:10:10.569]  And Sean Hannity's a Mr. America guy.
[01:10:10.589 --> 01:10:13.152]  He really means what he's saying and believes in what he's doing.
[01:10:13.172 --> 01:10:17.737]  And I could get he couldn't deal with a lot of stuff I was covering because it just sounded outrageous.
[01:10:18.277 --> 01:10:24.064]  Now, decades later, I have a lot more credibility because so much of what I broke down has now come out exactly as I said it was happening.
[01:10:24.404 --> 01:10:25.446]  Well, of course, I have the documents.
[01:10:25.466 --> 01:10:26.026]  I have the sources.
[01:10:26.747 --> 01:10:27.868]  But Hannity's a hero now.
[01:10:28.508 --> 01:10:31.391]  I'm not in competition with his radio show, even though I am on some stations.
[01:10:31.971 --> 01:10:34.133]  I'm not in competition against Fox News.
[01:10:34.893 --> 01:10:39.677]  I wish other people would take the floor and start doing a better job than I'm doing.
[01:10:39.817 --> 01:10:51.686]  And in the case of the 15-minute report he filed Tuesday night, that I didn't see yesterday because I was working on other issues, that I saw last night and this morning, it's just incredible.
[01:10:52.406 --> 01:10:54.108]  And the Washington Post wants him fired.
[01:10:55.302 --> 01:10:59.328]  Here's the headline, Fox News Sean Hannity is encroaching on Alex Jones territory.
[01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:01.070]  You mean he's encroaching on reality?
[01:11:01.451 --> 01:11:10.764]  You mean he's actually reading the New Yorker magazine and other elite publications like Atlantic Monthly that the elite left read where they actually tell the truth?
[01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:37.315]  Like Public Affairs of the Washington Post, where they say the CIA is involved trying to overthrow Trump, and that $600 million was given by Jeff Bezos from the CIA and the Washington Post to put out propaganda on Trump, and that they want a deep state overthrow and a new presidential succession to remove the Republicans in Congress that were elected in 2016, saying that they were put in by the Russians?
[01:11:37.555 --> 01:11:38.675]  I mean, here's the article!
[01:11:38.956 --> 01:11:39.416]  Go read it!
[01:11:40.765 --> 01:11:44.666]  This is just Atlantic Monthly rewriting the rules of presidential succession.
[01:11:46.486 --> 01:11:56.989]  A project begun at 9-11 assumes new urgency after the 2016 election, creating a more sensible plan for what happens when a chief executive steps aside or is removed.
[01:11:58.009 --> 01:12:00.490]  So they make it sound real reasonable, real nice.
[01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:05.511]  This would be like you were writing an article about, we reasonably want to grab kids out of the back of your yard and eat them.
[01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:09.384]  We want to reasonably detonate nuclear weapons and destroy the planet.
[01:12:09.684 --> 01:12:21.574]  And they just, oh, and then you read the article, yeah, the Russians stole the election, and everybody that got elected needs to be removed, and Homeland Security needs to take over the election, and have a new one, and safeguard it to make sure Democrats stay in power.
[01:12:21.594 --> 01:12:26.698]  You have to understand, when you're reading this, they've already Homeland Security-ed the elections.
[01:12:26.718 --> 01:12:28.679]  They already took control of them when Obama left office.
[01:12:29.039 --> 01:12:30.961]  Trump can't even get the bureaucracies to back off.
[01:12:31.241 --> 01:12:33.603]  All 50 state attorney generals have said get rid of it.
[01:12:33.643 --> 01:12:34.484]  It's a total nightmare.
[01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:41.370]  Most of it's in place.
[01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:42.210]  90% or so is in place.
[01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:43.991]  I'd say about 93%.
[01:12:45.331 --> 01:12:48.472]  The last 7% is gow lighting.
[01:12:50.052 --> 01:12:54.833]  They've got to get the minds ready.
[01:12:56.233 --> 01:13:02.455]  They've got to prepare the public for Trump's death, prepare the public that Alex Jones is an evil guy.
[01:13:04.315 --> 01:13:06.556]  It's what he said about the Sandy Hook families that he didn't say.
[01:13:06.576 --> 01:13:08.717]  So, you know, thank God somebody killed him or whatever.
[01:13:08.997 --> 01:13:10.198]  You know, just some lone nut, of course.
[01:13:10.538 --> 01:13:12.118]  They're just preparing everyone for their death.
[01:13:13.819 --> 01:13:18.361]  And infiltrating families and infiltrating businesses and just... I mean, the stuff going on.
[01:13:18.401 --> 01:13:20.522]  The payoffs and the black ops.
[01:13:20.622 --> 01:13:22.383]  It's just... hellish.
[01:13:23.043 --> 01:13:23.924]  But I expected it.
[01:13:24.244 --> 01:13:24.904]  I asked for it.
[01:13:25.304 --> 01:13:26.065]  I'm in the middle of it.
[01:13:26.825 --> 01:13:29.486]  Way crazier than any action-adventure movie.
[01:13:30.567 --> 01:13:31.427]  It's called reality.
[01:13:31.487 --> 01:13:32.707]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:13:32.948 --> 01:13:33.548]  Times a hundred.
[01:13:35.069 --> 01:13:37.593]  So, I believe God is stronger than the devil.
[01:13:37.633 --> 01:13:38.234]  I know God is.
[01:13:38.294 --> 01:13:43.182]  And I believe you're stronger than the globalists and the leftist vassals and minions and their poor slaves.
[01:13:43.783 --> 01:13:44.945]  They're Gollum-like slaves.
[01:13:45.905 --> 01:13:51.147]  And so I'm asking, I am humbly requesting your prayers.
[01:13:51.967 --> 01:13:54.408]  I come off sometimes as a little bit arrogant.
[01:13:54.468 --> 01:13:55.869]  It's not that.
[01:13:56.249 --> 01:14:00.071]  It's the confidence of a man that knows he's in a fight for his life.
[01:14:00.371 --> 01:14:01.491]  It's not arrogant, believe me.
[01:14:02.932 --> 01:14:04.793]  It's not putting a good face on it either.
[01:14:04.953 --> 01:14:07.854]  It's getting into the mode of enjoying all this.
[01:14:09.838 --> 01:14:15.623]  And so, thank you for putting up with me, but understand, ladies and gentlemen, I haven't told you a third of what's going on behind the scenes.
[01:14:15.703 --> 01:14:17.064]  I mean, it is crazy.
[01:14:18.545 --> 01:14:24.029]  And... A lot of people say, well, then we better not fight tyranny, they'll come after us.
[01:14:24.089 --> 01:14:25.170]  No, they won't come after the big guys.
[01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:32.015]  This is the time where you have real power to devastate the globalists and the information war, and really not even have any repercussions.
[01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:34.257]  The repercussions are if you do nothing.
[01:14:36.428 --> 01:14:37.508]  That's how evil thrives.
[01:14:37.768 --> 01:14:38.609]  That's how it takes over.
[01:14:38.649 --> 01:14:40.029]  That's how it has victory after victory.
[01:14:40.289 --> 01:14:55.115]  And we've seen these anti-human, anti-God, anti-family, anti-America globalists wreck the third world, wreck society, engage in massive human experimentation, engage in so many crimes it's dizzying to even try to think of a handful of them because there's so many.
[01:14:56.955 --> 01:14:58.156]  You know, what do you boil it down to?
[01:15:08.151 --> 01:15:10.734]  They're preparing for the overthrow of Western Civilization.
[01:15:11.135 --> 01:15:12.116]  They were so close.
[01:15:15.079 --> 01:15:26.533]  We were sliding down, about to fall off the precipice, and the Liberty Movement in America shot up an arm, and it's holding on with one hand, and we're trying to pull up, and the MSM
[01:15:27.932 --> 01:15:34.835]  The Destroy America crowd, the Destroy Trump crowd, the Destroy Christian crowd is just hanging on to our ankles and they want to go.
[01:15:34.875 --> 01:15:35.655]  They want to fall.
[01:15:35.935 --> 01:15:37.636]  They don't care if they get destroyed in the process.
[01:15:37.976 --> 01:15:39.316]  They hate us.
[01:15:41.857 --> 01:15:47.739]  I mean, you go out to a leftist event, they all look like they've had serious brain trauma.
[01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:53.001]  You know they all grew up in little cribs, little cages.
[01:15:53.201 --> 01:15:54.522]  You know they didn't get any loving.
[01:15:55.422 --> 01:15:56.903]  You know they didn't get held up against mama.
[01:15:57.861 --> 01:15:59.442]  More than maybe an hour a week if they were lucky.
[01:16:03.045 --> 01:16:04.826]  And they got eyes like zombies.
[01:16:06.027 --> 01:16:07.288]  And then you look at their controllers.
[01:16:07.988 --> 01:16:14.913]  They are just wicked, envious, hateful people who are just the trash of the earth.
[01:16:15.914 --> 01:16:17.795]  The just unmitigated trash.
[01:16:18.676 --> 01:16:27.482]  I mean, if people knew, if they just saw, if they researched, they would be absolutely vomiting not believing they were so kind.
[01:16:40.816 --> 01:16:51.225]  If you want another mindset, think about Congressman Scalise and the police and all the rest of them shot a week and a half ago at that baseball game in Virginia.
[01:16:52.867 --> 01:16:55.349]  And how the New York Times said, this is where they are, this is where you can get them.
[01:16:55.369 --> 01:16:57.171]  I mean, it's just, it's all so concerted.
[01:16:57.491 --> 01:17:00.994]  They know they put on enough messaging, they put on enough stimuli, it's going to happen.
[01:17:01.915 --> 01:17:05.178]  It's like varmint calls, you know, I mean, they know it's coming in, or duck calls.
[01:17:06.553 --> 01:17:11.257]  They're calling it in, and then Trump, yesterday at a rally, says, let's have our prayers go out to him and others that were shot.
[01:17:11.797 --> 01:17:15.880]  And then they pause, and then all the leftists start screaming, yelling, and booing, and hissing.
[01:17:16.881 --> 01:17:17.922]  It illustrates everything.
[01:17:17.962 --> 01:17:18.362]  Here's a clip.
[01:17:23.026 --> 01:17:35.315]  I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend, somebody that I've gotten to know very well, Steve Scalise, and everyone
[01:17:36.604 --> 01:17:38.786]  Recovering from the assault.
[01:17:38.806 --> 01:17:39.506]  Never fails.
[01:17:59.344 --> 01:18:00.865]  And notice the spirit that defeats them.
[01:18:00.985 --> 01:18:03.485]  Everyone just laughs at the lobotomized scum.
[01:18:03.825 --> 01:18:09.226]  You look at the Trump supporters, whether they're black, white, or Hispanic, shining eyes, awake, alive, hopeful for the future.
[01:18:09.246 --> 01:18:11.747]  You look at leftists, pissed, angry.
[01:18:12.047 --> 01:18:19.868]  They only believe they get power by getting control of the government and taking what you've got, as if they could manage or run any of it if they had control of it.
[01:18:21.089 --> 01:18:23.689]  As if you'd be happy being given something.
[01:18:24.469 --> 01:18:26.950]  It doesn't work anywhere because it's not human nature.
[01:18:28.137 --> 01:18:29.538]  And the Bezoses aren't liberals.
[01:18:29.978 --> 01:18:32.480]  They're the most hardcore, greedy jerks in the world.
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:35.281]  I mean, Bezos is eating Walmart.
[01:18:37.703 --> 01:18:41.545]  Globalism is designed to absorb free market and make you poor.
[01:18:41.665 --> 01:18:42.826]  That's their own white papers.
[01:18:43.706 --> 01:18:45.908]  But again, they think you don't read those.
[01:18:47.088 --> 01:18:47.569]  We do.
[01:18:48.089 --> 01:18:48.729]  We cover them.
[01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:50.290]  We show you where they say it.
[01:18:50.631 --> 01:18:51.451]  That's why they hate us.
[01:18:52.972 --> 01:18:55.954]  They want to communicate in Atlantic Monthly about how they're getting ready for a government overthrow.
[01:18:57.627 --> 01:19:06.372]  And how they're going to arrest everybody, and how they're going to shut down the free press, and how they're going to kick all the Republican congressmen out who got elected in the last election.
[01:19:06.392 --> 01:19:11.696]  And they think you're so stupid that you can't go read that.
[01:19:11.896 --> 01:19:16.759]  Then they have the Washington Post go, Hannity, you're going to get fired if you keep quoting Alex Jones.
[01:19:16.779 --> 01:19:17.959]  He's not quoting me.
[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:22.362]  Nobody talks to the President who isn't in the White House more than Sean Hannity.
[01:19:22.682 --> 01:19:24.003]  Let me just give you that in his flesh.
[01:19:25.626 --> 01:19:27.427]  You might as well be hearing Trump talk.
[01:19:28.908 --> 01:19:31.410]  So get that, Trump knows all of it.
[01:19:31.930 --> 01:19:40.116]  And guess who briefed him before he got elected, and before he got in the White House, and guess who told him word for word what they would do?
[01:19:40.796 --> 01:19:41.577]  Word for word.
[01:19:42.597 --> 01:19:42.917]  I did.
[01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:50.963]  And I told him, you go talk to top generals, you go talk to experts of overthrowing countries, and you get ready, sir, because this is how they're going to do it.
[01:19:52.532 --> 01:19:54.235]  My greatest achievement, that's right.
[01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:57.018]  And that's why the globalists, they listen to my phones, they know.
[01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:57.519]  They hate me.
[01:19:58.621 --> 01:19:59.041]  They hate me.
[01:19:59.722 --> 01:20:01.665]  Because I'm a wartime analyst for the Republican.
[01:20:01.705 --> 01:20:02.146]  We're winning.
[01:20:06.829 --> 01:20:10.891]  Democracy Partners attacks Veritas launches $1 million federal lawsuit.
[01:20:11.012 --> 01:20:13.073]  And so that's where all of this is going.
[01:20:13.093 --> 01:20:13.833]  And he joins us.
[01:20:14.233 --> 01:20:14.994]  Remember the clips.
[01:20:15.074 --> 01:20:16.935]  Talk about game changer in the election.
[01:20:17.075 --> 01:20:19.697]  It's not true that I or you defeated Hillary.
[01:20:19.797 --> 01:20:21.338]  She's blamed 20 different groups.
[01:20:22.018 --> 01:20:27.541]  Veritas, Drudge, Infowars, the Russians, misogyny, racism.
[01:20:28.162 --> 01:20:28.522]  Never!
[01:20:28.862 --> 01:20:30.923]  The fact that people are sick of her and her policies.
[01:20:32.164 --> 01:20:33.725]  So James O'Keefe, thanks for joining us.
[01:20:34.531 --> 01:20:35.591]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[01:20:35.651 --> 01:20:38.132]  I think reality defeated Hillary Clinton.
[01:20:38.152 --> 01:20:40.353]  You know, the truth defeated Hillary Clinton.
[01:20:40.433 --> 01:20:50.876]  And now, just yesterday, it was announced a lawsuit, a million-dollar lawsuit, against my team, Veritas, from this guy Bob Kramer, who's one of Barack Obama's close friends.
[01:20:51.556 --> 01:20:52.996]  We're basically retaliating.
[01:20:53.036 --> 01:20:55.437]  You know, we exposed the fraud during the election.
[01:20:55.457 --> 01:21:02.219]  We exposed the four-part series, sending shockwaves to the DNC about voter fraud, use of dark money.
[01:21:02.959 --> 01:21:06.480]  From an overseas donor to arrange these types of things.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:09.461]  So they sued me for a million dollars and they want to shut us down.
[01:21:09.501 --> 01:21:10.982]  Then I get calls from Politico.
[01:21:11.002 --> 01:21:15.683]  I get calls from all these mainstream outlets that suddenly want to talk to me now that I'm being sued.
[01:21:16.283 --> 01:21:18.344]  And I want to know who's funding this lawsuit.
[01:21:18.504 --> 01:21:21.145]  I said that over my dead body will I ever shut up.
[01:21:21.205 --> 01:21:28.307]  Bob Kramer, Barack Obama's friend and the person Hillary Clinton had to fire, is now suing me for a million dollars for the videos that we did during the election.
[01:21:28.447 --> 01:21:37.041]  To me, this is about just silencing you, but more importantly, intimidating other people that, oh look, we'll sue you if you do more stuff like James O'Keefe did.
[01:21:38.178 --> 01:21:41.940]  Yeah, I mean, I think investigative journalism itself is on the line.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:49.604]  I mean, a lot of media companies don't have the brass balls it takes to go out and speak truth to power.
[01:21:49.624 --> 01:22:01.850]  I said on your show before that a lot of these journalists, a lot of these media organizations can't do the job because they're worried about the government regulators coming after them, let's say if Hillary was elected.
[01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:14.794]  And we went out on a limb and did it, and they're trying to deter us and establishment news organizations from speaking truth to power against the establishment because this is what happens to you when you do so.
[01:22:14.834 --> 01:22:16.455]  You get sued for a million dollars.
[01:22:16.515 --> 01:22:17.675]  This is a press stunt.
[01:22:18.115 --> 01:22:19.596]  Kramer is pulling a million dollars.
[01:22:19.616 --> 01:22:20.836]  What does that even mean, a million dollars?
[01:22:21.096 --> 01:22:25.218]  And by the way, Alex, we live in a media environment where people can use anonymous sources.
[01:22:25.678 --> 01:22:30.663]  Every single claim that we make is buttressed by videotape of them saying what they said.
[01:22:30.744 --> 01:22:31.224]  Exactly.
[01:22:31.244 --> 01:22:37.551]  And yet, you're not supposed to believe us, you're supposed to believe all these journalists who use anonymous sources quoting hearsay from other anonymous sources.
[01:22:37.571 --> 01:22:38.492]  I think we need to start
[01:22:40.811 --> 01:22:42.272]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:13.231]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:23:13.931 --> 01:23:17.915]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:23:18.795 --> 01:23:21.017]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:23:21.097 --> 01:23:22.238]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:23:22.278 --> 01:23:26.822]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat, or more.
[01:23:26.922 --> 01:23:28.824]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:23:29.344 --> 01:23:34.268]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22, when I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:23:34.368 --> 01:23:36.130]  It's actually scary.
[01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:47.073]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:23:48.094 --> 01:24:00.898]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[01:24:08.007 --> 01:24:19.393]  Sean Hannity made history in a 15-minute special report that's posted in fullwars.com, where he laid out the deep state's plan for a violent overthrow of Trump, but they're now preparing.
[01:24:19.433 --> 01:24:21.595]  And Colonel Schaffer's joining us in the next hour.
[01:24:22.255 --> 01:24:24.396]  He, of course, said that a month ago on Lou Dobbs' business.
[01:24:24.436 --> 01:24:25.237]  This is the fact.
[01:24:25.697 --> 01:24:28.619]  The Democrats are in their own publications preparing this.
[01:24:28.679 --> 01:24:32.361]  They want to deny it, say we're crazy, even though it's in their own publications.
[01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:39.185]  They want to prepare it, then use the military tactic of denying it, so we can't organize a defense around it.
[01:24:39.465 --> 01:24:42.446]  It's outrageous words.
[01:24:43.747 --> 01:24:51.632]  The semantical lexicon, the Encyclopedia Britannica, cannot describe how historic, how mighty this is.
[01:24:51.652 --> 01:24:58.756]  I mean, Trump knew it was coming, but he thought he could just turn the economy on, work with people, give them a seat at the table, they'd back off.
[01:24:59.136 --> 01:24:59.276]  No.
[01:25:01.075 --> 01:25:04.497]  They want to bring him down, and he tried working with them.
[01:25:04.957 --> 01:25:06.498]  He now knows it isn't going to happen.
[01:25:06.698 --> 01:25:08.999]  We told you a month and a half ago, get ready, he's making a turn back.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:16.923]  Ladies and gentlemen, it could happen any minute, it could happen next month, it could happen six months from now, but they are pushing a violent coup, as you see.
[01:25:17.183 --> 01:25:18.544]  They're calling for war in the streets.
[01:25:18.924 --> 01:25:21.925]  Soros is funding massive insurrection this July 2nd.
[01:25:23.826 --> 01:25:26.227]  They've succeeded many other countries, that's why they're so arrogant.
[01:25:28.615 --> 01:25:29.816]  We're a peaceful, good people.
[01:25:29.876 --> 01:25:33.839]  We don't know how to deal with this type of subterfuge in our own government.
[01:25:33.859 --> 01:25:35.240]  This is what happens in third world countries.
[01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:43.887]  The amount of traitors, of leftists brainwashed in the colleges that have national security clearances is unprecedented.
[01:25:44.994 --> 01:25:46.435]  We have a giant fifth column.
[01:25:47.095 --> 01:25:48.156]  The country has cancer.
[01:25:49.977 --> 01:25:55.700]  And just to see Trump trying to turn the economy back on, trying to bring hope back under such attack, makes me love him so much.
[01:25:56.361 --> 01:25:57.722]  And some people want to hedge their bets.
[01:25:57.762 --> 01:25:58.962]  They think Trump's going to be destroyed.
[01:25:59.183 --> 01:26:01.164]  We're all going to be destroyed if he's destroyed, folks.
[01:26:03.885 --> 01:26:07.588]  I feel so sorry for the leftists, because I've war-gamed and others have war-gamed this civil war.
[01:26:07.608 --> 01:26:09.449]  If it goes physical, you're going to lose.
[01:26:10.649 --> 01:26:13.874]  And there's nowhere Soros is gonna be able to hide, and that's not talk, people.
[01:26:14.174 --> 01:26:15.456]  I told you Trump was gonna win.
[01:26:19.101 --> 01:26:20.603]  This stuff goes beyond analysis.
[01:26:24.308 --> 01:26:25.870]  Let's play a little clip of Hannity, here it is.
[01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:39.799]  Also tonight, a soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office.
[01:26:40.319 --> 01:26:46.404]  Sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear and present danger.
[01:26:46.944 --> 01:26:49.006]  That is tonight's very important opening monologue.
[01:26:49.866 --> 01:26:53.069]  Alright, now, why are they saying fire him over this?
[01:26:53.953 --> 01:26:55.234]  They say, fire him over Seth Rich.
[01:26:55.594 --> 01:26:57.675]  An unsolved murder, shot in the back.
[01:26:58.596 --> 01:27:01.157]  Whitney Leak says, we don't want to say it, but yeah, he's the leaker.
[01:27:02.038 --> 01:27:04.419]  He's coming out criticizing Bernie Sanders being robbed.
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:06.781]  Oh my gosh, it's crazy!
[01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:07.261]  Fire him!
[01:27:08.021 --> 01:27:10.403]  Now, Washington Post says, you better watch it.
[01:27:10.423 --> 01:27:11.844]  You thought you were going to be fired.
[01:27:11.884 --> 01:27:12.284]  You are.
[01:27:12.744 --> 01:27:14.185]  You don't bring up this crazy stuff.
[01:27:14.225 --> 01:27:18.788]  And they show quotes of what he said, when it's all out of publications of the establishment.
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:21.741]  They are scared of this, folks.
[01:27:22.081 --> 01:27:24.422]  They want to develop this without us challenging it.
[01:27:26.284 --> 01:27:39.492]  See, a lot of men think they're alphas, but a real alpha male wants to find other alpha males and alpha females and good people and build a defense of the structure and humanity, not be threatened by other successful people.
[01:27:39.952 --> 01:27:44.114]  I am so happy Sean Hannity has discovered all the truth and is now exposing it.
[01:27:44.134 --> 01:27:45.115]  This is a big victory.
[01:27:45.415 --> 01:27:46.296]  He has so much courage.
[01:27:46.912 --> 01:27:48.953]  Knowing what I've gone through, I can't imagine behind the scenes.
[01:27:49.013 --> 01:27:50.473]  It's probably threats on his family, you name it.
[01:27:51.313 --> 01:27:52.414]  We know it's threats on his job.
[01:27:52.554 --> 01:27:55.075]  And so, it just, it just, it's a good thing.
[01:27:55.095 --> 01:27:56.835]  Because he's more articulate than I am in many ways.
[01:27:57.335 --> 01:27:59.076]  And this is what we've been waiting for, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:59.096 --> 01:28:00.056]  This is what we've been waiting for.
[01:28:00.737 --> 01:28:02.777]  Because he's got a lot of credibility with mainline Republicans.
[01:28:02.797 --> 01:28:03.878]  This is the chain reaction.
[01:28:04.518 --> 01:28:09.359]  This smells like victory, just like the big defeat of the globalists in Georgia two days ago.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:11.900]  Sean Hannity.
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:13.761]  The real deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:14.787 --> 01:28:15.368]  The real deal.
[01:28:15.808 --> 01:28:16.690]  Doesn't hate America.
[01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:18.452]  Doesn't want to sell you and your family out.
[01:28:18.752 --> 01:28:19.593]  Hidden a scumbag.
[01:28:20.575 --> 01:28:21.376]  Got more men like him.
[01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:22.317]  We're going to beat these people.
[01:28:22.337 --> 01:28:23.439]  Just briefly, they're telling me to plug.
[01:28:23.459 --> 01:28:25.421]  We're not going to be able to continue operating.
[01:28:25.441 --> 01:28:27.584]  You know, I'm not underwritten by George Soros or the CIA.
[01:28:27.644 --> 01:28:29.046]  I'm underwritten by people like you.
[01:28:29.947 --> 01:28:30.767]  And I need support.
[01:28:31.368 --> 01:28:34.349]  We've got great products that are such amazing, life-changing for me.
[01:28:34.369 --> 01:28:40.551]  We've got the very best vitamin, mineral fusion, amino acid, fruit punch, great for your kids, great for you to absorb it all, set of pills.
[01:28:41.211 --> 01:28:44.192]  We've got the X2, the good halogen that changed my whole life.
[01:28:44.212 --> 01:28:47.674]  I lost like 30 pounds with less exercise once I finally did it.
[01:28:47.714 --> 01:28:49.134]  I lost like 30 before that.
[01:28:49.694 --> 01:28:53.096]  But it just, it's made me lazy, actually, X2 and Supermelon stuff.
[01:28:53.116 --> 01:28:54.336]  That's all there.
[01:28:54.356 --> 01:28:59.038]  40% off on the Emrix Essentials when you get the outdoor pack with sunscreen.
[01:28:59.818 --> 01:29:00.598]  With the bug spray.
[01:29:00.618 --> 01:29:01.838]  It's all natural organic.
[01:29:02.578 --> 01:29:07.699]  We've got just, in fact, you notice the specials just get bigger and bigger because folks respond better when the sales get better and better.
[01:29:08.259 --> 01:29:10.820]  It's not like we raise the price and lower it and call it a sale.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.120]  These are 40% off high quality storable foods.

[01:29:46.773 --> 01:29:51.016]  Again, your financing this operation is essential to the war effort.
[01:29:51.036 --> 01:29:51.917]  Without you, we're done.
[01:29:52.057 --> 01:29:53.057]  We need your help.
[01:29:53.398 --> 01:29:54.078]  We need the funding.

[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:59.703]  But we gotta have your financial backing to deal the death blow.
[01:30:03.786 --> 01:30:07.308]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:13.833]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:30:14.213 --> 01:30:17.015]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:17.396 --> 01:30:20.378]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:20.598 --> 01:30:24.041]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:30:24.382 --> 01:30:26.123]  The left controls culture.
[01:30:26.163 --> 01:30:27.124]  They control arts.
[01:30:27.204 --> 01:30:28.426]  They control entertainment.
[01:30:28.726 --> 01:30:35.813]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:30:35.873 --> 01:30:38.275]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:30:38.756 --> 01:30:42.619]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:30:42.679 --> 01:30:44.741]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[01:30:45.362 --> 01:30:50.746]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[01:30:50.986 --> 01:30:57.251]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:30:57.311 --> 01:30:59.012]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:30:59.172 --> 01:31:00.353]  It's available right now.
[01:31:00.673 --> 01:31:02.854]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:04.381 --> 01:31:07.983]  Wow, you're going to love the latest idea out of the EU.
[01:31:08.203 --> 01:31:18.608]  Scott Keller, a German member of the European Parliament and of the Green Party, said we should transplant entire villages from Syria to Germany and that would encourage more migrants to enter Germany.
[01:31:18.768 --> 01:31:19.788]  Listen to these quotes.
[01:31:19.988 --> 01:31:27.812]  The idea of Syrian villages is only one possibility we can use, for example, if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees.
[01:31:28.052 --> 01:31:33.373]  People would rather go where compatriots already live, which makes integration and acceptance easier.
[01:31:33.533 --> 01:31:35.254]  Let's look at these three compatriots.
[01:31:35.534 --> 01:31:36.554]  From Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:31:36.794 --> 01:31:37.154]  Sweden.
[01:31:37.194 --> 01:31:39.875]  Migrants viciously beat disabled man while calling him racist.
[01:31:40.155 --> 01:31:46.276]  Three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a homeless man's wallet in a train station during an incident which took place last month.
[01:31:46.336 --> 01:31:53.378]  The handicapped man was kicked and punched and received a vicious uppercut as one of the migrants lectured him about war on Muslims and how all Swedes were racist.
[01:31:53.678 --> 01:31:55.419]  Now how's that for acceptance?
[01:31:55.599 --> 01:31:58.601]  You can read both articles now on InfoWars.com.
[01:31:58.861 --> 01:32:02.023]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:32:04.608 --> 01:32:09.511]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[01:32:10.312 --> 01:32:13.234]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[01:32:13.914 --> 01:32:16.696]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[01:32:17.337 --> 01:32:22.220]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:28.864]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[01:32:29.244 --> 01:32:34.408]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[01:32:35.068 --> 01:32:38.491]  That's why I recommend Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[01:32:39.071 --> 01:32:46.897]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[01:32:47.478 --> 01:32:51.821]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[01:32:52.141 --> 01:32:56.084]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.
[01:32:56.384 --> 01:33:00.207]  Stay in the game with Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Natural Deodorant.
[01:33:00.447 --> 01:33:02.108]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:33:07.026 --> 01:33:13.329]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:19.931]  I know you can see me now, here's a surprise.
[01:33:20.392 --> 01:33:27.415]  I know that you have, cause there's magic in my eyes.
[01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:35.438]  I can see for miles and miles and miles and miles.
[01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:41.671]  That's right, and we laid out the COG plan, Continuity of Government, to overthrow Trump.
[01:33:42.791 --> 01:33:48.293]  We laid out how they openly would try to steal the nomination from Trump.
[01:33:49.273 --> 01:33:57.615]  They tried that, then they tried to steal the delegates, they tried to steal the electors, and they kept saying, oh no, no one's trying to do that, as they were organizing it.
[01:33:59.155 --> 01:34:05.237]  Then I pointed out that Nancy Pelosi's daughter was honchoing it, and Nancy Pelosi called in
[01:34:06.667 --> 01:34:11.129]  Then Attorney General Loretta Lynch had said, I want Alex Jones arrested.
[01:34:14.651 --> 01:34:16.011]  I got this from Trump Tower.
[01:34:17.212 --> 01:34:19.693]  I got this from the incoming folks at Justice Department.
[01:34:19.793 --> 01:34:23.495]  They had to tell Lynch, we're not going to go along with that.
[01:34:23.535 --> 01:34:24.235]  Are you insane?
[01:34:26.056 --> 01:34:27.256]  I was told that a day before.
[01:34:29.017 --> 01:34:34.380]  Then Nancy Pelosi's daughter went on Fox News and said that I had death threatened her.
[01:34:35.666 --> 01:34:37.267]  And that she basically wanted me arrested.
[01:34:38.548 --> 01:34:39.548]  These people are insane.
[01:34:40.649 --> 01:34:52.076]  Pelosi is bumbling around completely insane, her and her daughter, in like ten different, there's ten different ones because I've seen the clips, ten different cases in the last six months.
[01:34:52.476 --> 01:34:54.417]  First thing, George W. Bush is in office.
[01:34:54.858 --> 01:34:58.980]  He hadn't been in office in eight and a half years, ladies and gentlemen, or more than eight and a half years, a little more than eight and a half.
[01:35:00.341 --> 01:35:01.061]  Eight and a half and change.
[01:35:01.442 --> 01:35:02.202]  Eight and a half in two days.
[01:35:02.222 --> 01:35:03.223]  I'm going to get technical.
[01:35:05.799 --> 01:35:06.579]  This is incredible.
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:12.821]  And the issue here is, they mean business.
[01:35:12.841 --> 01:35:23.745]  And I'm going to play some clips coming up of the Republican ads they ran in these four states, where we've had four victories, despite the Democrats spending the largest amounts of money in their history.
[01:35:24.285 --> 01:35:29.907]  Now, Dr. Corsi has, at many New York Times bestselling books, number one.
[01:35:31.069 --> 01:35:31.269]  I don't
[01:35:51.235 --> 01:35:52.517]  He's a master with his instincts.
[01:35:53.118 --> 01:35:55.982]  Letting them go boo Scalise when he says get better.
[01:35:56.282 --> 01:35:57.985]  Let the Democrats call for murder and death.
[01:35:58.846 --> 01:36:05.154]  Wait till they make their big violent move and he's ready to then at that point to deal with them all.
[01:36:05.755 --> 01:36:07.738]  That's just what I've gleaned from what I've seen.
[01:36:08.604 --> 01:36:24.136]  That said, they are so scared of us talking about COG and the preparations to overthrow Trump, Washington Post is calling for Hannity to be fired for quote, being in Alex Jones territory, for actually just quoting real news articles when the Democrats are preparing this.
[01:36:24.176 --> 01:36:29.140]  So, Doc, I know you want to talk about his powers and what he needs to do, but isn't the real power
[01:36:30.856 --> 01:36:37.318]  We the people should be taking over all the live TV shows that are in public, legally and lawfully.
[01:36:37.678 --> 01:36:38.999]  Flooding C-SPAN every day.
[01:36:39.319 --> 01:36:40.419]  Flooding talk radio.
[01:36:40.899 --> 01:36:43.420]  Flooding our congressmen and women's phone numbers.
[01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:45.821]  This should be bigger than the campaign of 2016.
[01:36:46.401 --> 01:36:47.982]  This is the big fight.
[01:36:48.262 --> 01:36:51.603]  So Dr. Corsi, historically where are we?
[01:36:51.663 --> 01:36:57.365]  And how big a defeat is it for them that our talking points, exposing their plans, are now breaking through?
[01:36:57.665 --> 01:37:01.506]  Well, it's a huge defeat, and I think that it's going to continue.
[01:37:01.586 --> 01:37:05.387]  What you're finding is that the American public are responding, they're listening.
[01:37:05.928 --> 01:37:11.429]  And Donald Trump does have to begin to prepare to use the powers of the presidency.
[01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:12.850]  I continue to say this.
[01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:14.350]  I'm taking control.
[01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:20.592]  I mean, look, even yesterday, Jay Johnson, if you listen carefully to his testimony, said we've got cyber attacks.
[01:37:20.632 --> 01:37:21.352]  What does that mean?
[01:37:21.692 --> 01:37:26.794]  Department of Homeland Security would be happy to take over all the state election processes.
[01:37:27.414 --> 01:37:29.495]  We'll protect you from cyber attacks.
[01:37:29.555 --> 01:37:33.416]  And then the question is, well, were any votes changed by the Russians?
[01:37:33.756 --> 01:37:33.936]  No.
[01:37:34.736 --> 01:37:41.420]  It's just a DHS attempt to use a scare to say we want to take over all the state election process.
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:51.046]  And Trump has a letter from all 50 attorney generals saying they don't like Obama's final executive order federalizing elections as infrastructure protection under COG.
[01:37:51.507 --> 01:37:54.288]  Why hasn't Trump signed an executive order reversing that?
[01:37:54.469 --> 01:37:55.509]  Well, exactly.
[01:37:55.569 --> 01:37:59.192]  And, you know, look, now we're finding out that the whole
[01:37:59.952 --> 01:38:14.521]  Trump administration is faced with Obama saying all of the masking information, all the documents relationship to Susan Rice, well those are now all given over to the Obama library so they're no longer available.
[01:38:15.341 --> 01:38:17.722]  We've got a court case going in the district court.
[01:38:17.763 --> 01:38:20.124]  We've got them classifying their illegal activity.
[01:38:20.184 --> 01:38:20.664]  I mean, let's explain.
[01:38:23.473 --> 01:38:23.994]  Let's explain.
[01:38:24.294 --> 01:38:25.836]  We come in to restore the republic.
[01:38:26.576 --> 01:38:30.781]  Obama activates a deep state, says he's putting stay-behind networks in, announces it in the New York Times.
[01:38:31.382 --> 01:38:32.523]  They engage in all this.
[01:38:33.023 --> 01:38:33.864]  This is an open...
[01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:36.929]  Counteraction against our action.
[01:38:55.871 --> 01:39:00.395]  We'd have the Department of Homeland Security take over the state electoral processes.
[01:39:00.795 --> 01:39:02.437]  We'll flood the country with illegals.
[01:39:02.777 --> 01:39:04.258]  They'll be all able to vote.
[01:39:04.758 --> 01:39:11.324]  All of these are step-by-step undermining the democratic processes on which Donald Trump was duly elected.
[01:39:11.344 --> 01:39:16.068]  And it's all totally transparent, so what does the president need to do and what do we need to do?
[01:39:16.348 --> 01:39:20.470]  Well, the president, first of all, has got to start using the powers of the presidency much more effectively.
[01:39:20.530 --> 01:39:32.496]  He's got to start saying, we don't need to have an hour press conference every day for the mainstream media to sit in the front seat of this little room, this press room, and act up.
[01:39:33.777 --> 01:39:36.558]  And be shown to be opposing the president and set the agenda.
[01:39:36.918 --> 01:39:39.539]  Move the mainstream media to the back row.
[01:39:39.579 --> 01:39:41.460]  Move out of that press room.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:42.881]  Take them off the lawn.
[01:39:42.901 --> 01:39:45.722]  If they want to broadcast from the lawn, they can use green screen.
[01:39:46.682 --> 01:39:50.584]  Break up the monopoly of the mainstream media and Donald Trump can do it.
[01:39:50.604 --> 01:39:54.565]  There's no law that says he has to have a daily televised press conference.
[01:39:55.185 --> 01:39:57.246]  Secondly, get rid of Priebus.
[01:39:57.326 --> 01:40:01.528]  Get all of the people out of the administration who are not loyal to Donald Trump.
[01:40:02.088 --> 01:40:04.109]  Well, he said July 4th, they're gone.
[01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:06.430]  I'm looking forward to that.
[01:40:07.051 --> 01:40:08.611]  And secondly... Don't you love those optics?
[01:40:08.631 --> 01:40:09.212]  July 4th.
[01:40:09.272 --> 01:40:09.572]  Bam.
[01:40:09.852 --> 01:40:10.172]  Boom.
[01:40:10.272 --> 01:40:11.653]  Well, you know, he's got to do it.
[01:40:11.733 --> 01:40:12.373]  Clean house.
[01:40:12.894 --> 01:40:13.534]  Take control.
[01:40:13.554 --> 01:40:17.176]  Well, I think he should launch his counter-operations in and around July 4th.
[01:40:17.196 --> 01:40:18.176]  That has good symbolism.
[01:40:18.517 --> 01:40:21.038]  But he's also telegraphed that, so maybe he should launch it tomorrow.
[01:40:21.258 --> 01:40:22.399]  Because here's the issue.
[01:40:23.359 --> 01:40:23.799]  Here's the key.
[01:40:24.139 --> 01:40:28.562]  The Democrats are saying kill Trump, kill his supporters, murder everybody, overthrow Trump.
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:31.341]  Declare the 2016 election null and void.
[01:40:32.121 --> 01:40:34.262]  Obama executive order federalizes elections.
[01:40:34.302 --> 01:40:35.243]  That hasn't been reversed.
[01:40:36.363 --> 01:40:41.166]  And they're saying all this, then we report on what they're saying and they go, you're crazy.
[01:40:41.526 --> 01:40:42.406]  None of that's happening.
[01:40:42.686 --> 01:40:43.427]  You're insane.
[01:40:43.827 --> 01:40:44.627]  Why are they doing that?
[01:40:44.827 --> 01:40:49.490]  So we don't form an opposition and then low information voters hear all this and think, oh,
[01:40:50.413 --> 01:40:51.234]  That's too radical.
[01:40:51.254 --> 01:40:56.517]  There's no way Alex Jones or Sean Hannity are telling the truth, or Trump's telling the truth, but that's what happened!
[01:40:57.198 --> 01:41:03.862]  Well, and look, Trump knows that it was the Alex Jones audience that put him in the White House.
[01:41:04.402 --> 01:41:08.325]  And he's listening today to what's being said.
[01:41:08.885 --> 01:41:13.108]  President Trump understands, okay, IRS.
[01:41:13.649 --> 01:41:16.631]  Why do we still have the old Obama people in the IRS?
[01:41:16.651 --> 01:41:19.813]  Get rid of the IRS and investigate the Clinton Foundation.
[01:41:20.493 --> 01:41:22.494]  Why isn't Comey under investigation?
[01:41:22.794 --> 01:41:23.834]  He admitted he leaked.
[01:41:24.254 --> 01:41:30.735]  He admitted he took Loretta Lynch's instructions on the tarmac to scale back the investigation.
[01:41:30.816 --> 01:41:33.556]  Why aren't the Democrats under investigation?
[01:41:33.876 --> 01:41:40.778]  Why don't we have the House and Senate committees bringing the Democrats in and explaining how they tried to rig the election.
[01:41:41.198 --> 01:41:43.138]  We know that Hillary tried to rig the election.
[01:41:43.379 --> 01:41:45.339]  They've got the Chinese and Russian connections.
[01:41:45.659 --> 01:41:47.379]  They've got the IRS persecuting people.
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:49.240]  He needs to turn the tables now.
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:52.823]  Right, and take control of the powers the presidency has.
[01:41:53.343 --> 01:41:56.326]  Because again, there are enormous powers... Here's his problem.
[01:41:57.367 --> 01:41:59.508]  Even the people under him refuse to follow the orders.
[01:41:59.528 --> 01:42:04.512]  They tell him they are, then they call in his loyalists and fire them without even telling him.
[01:42:04.552 --> 01:42:06.154]  They are in open rebellion.
[01:42:06.554 --> 01:42:11.518]  And he's, and Donald Trump's gonna say, okay... So the answer is get rid of Priebus, get rid of all the Paul Ryan loyalists.
[01:42:11.598 --> 01:42:14.140]  All he's got to do is fire his top tier and he's good.
[01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:17.103]  And put the White House down to half the people in it.
[01:42:17.623 --> 01:42:27.074]  Because if you include too many people, you're going to include people in Washington who are going to leak against you, who are going to undermine you, who are not going to deal with the policies.
[01:42:27.394 --> 01:42:29.516]  Washington is different than New York.
[01:42:30.177 --> 01:42:32.760]  And being president is different than being CEO.
[01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.060]  And Donald Trump is coming to realize this.
[01:42:35.381 --> 01:42:39.842]  People in Washington, the first rule in Washington, if somebody's telling you something, they're lying.
[01:42:40.122 --> 01:42:40.542]  Exactly.
[01:42:40.582 --> 01:42:46.383]  Trump thinks make America prosperous and make people money and have freedom and everybody feel good, we'll be happy.
[01:42:46.443 --> 01:42:46.623]  No!
[01:42:46.843 --> 01:42:48.004]  We're not running a golf course.
[01:42:48.244 --> 01:42:49.224]  We're not running a hotel.
[01:42:49.504 --> 01:42:51.004]  The globalists want power.
[01:42:51.264 --> 01:42:52.745]  They want to piss on Christians.
[01:42:53.305 --> 01:42:54.505]  They want to piss on veterans.
[01:42:54.525 --> 01:42:58.466]  They want power over strong, good people because they're scumbags.
[01:42:58.906 --> 01:43:03.471]  And you've got to look to say, okay... Washington is about scumbags having victory over the good.
[01:43:03.571 --> 01:43:03.791]  Right.
[01:43:03.931 --> 01:43:05.453]  And it's about, okay, Priebus.
[01:43:05.893 --> 01:43:11.579]  Priebus has a meal ticket with the elite Republicans in Washington.
[01:43:11.979 --> 01:43:16.103]  So if Donald Trump is impeached or removed from office, Priebus has his next job.
[01:43:16.123 --> 01:43:19.026]  He hedged his bets, which made him a traitor from the beginning.
[01:43:19.066 --> 01:43:19.646]  Precisely.
[01:43:19.686 --> 01:43:22.849]  And in Washington, you've got to understand where people are going to get paid.
[01:43:23.410 --> 01:43:35.434]  And if they haven't out, if they think that they, Ryan, with the pharmaceutical companies and putting money into his campaigns, you know, do you think he's really in support of reforming Obamacare when it benefits the pharmaceutical companies?
[01:43:35.454 --> 01:43:37.475]  Look, we all know the Republican leadership is the big problem.
[01:43:37.515 --> 01:43:38.876]  The Democrats are imploding.
[01:43:38.916 --> 01:43:39.516]  They're a joke.
[01:43:39.536 --> 01:43:41.536]  They're becoming a regional coastal party.
[01:43:41.917 --> 01:43:42.617]  They're imploding.
[01:43:42.697 --> 01:43:46.578]  The problem is the Republican leadership, as I've always said, wrote Obamacare.
[01:43:46.818 --> 01:43:48.759]  They're even worse because they're competent.
[01:43:48.999 --> 01:43:50.560]  They don't think islands are floating.
[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:51.220]  They don't
[01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:53.422]  They don't think George W. Bush is still in office.
[01:43:53.602 --> 01:43:57.545]  They're a bunch of Ted Bundy slick psychopaths.
[01:43:57.925 --> 01:43:59.386]  And I'm so sick.
[01:43:59.466 --> 01:44:00.567]  You want about white males.
[01:44:00.907 --> 01:44:01.908]  They're the white males.
[01:44:01.988 --> 01:44:03.029]  I can't.
[01:44:03.049 --> 01:44:04.230]  We do have a white male problem.
[01:44:04.450 --> 01:44:07.332]  And it's called the Republican leadership that is a bunch of trash.
[01:44:08.073 --> 01:44:11.596]  And what's happening is communicating directly to the people, which
[01:44:12.256 --> 01:44:14.997]  The Alex Jones program has done for years.
[01:44:15.557 --> 01:44:16.757]  Goes just like Donald Trump.
[01:44:16.797 --> 01:44:17.518]  Why does he tweet?
[01:44:17.538 --> 01:44:19.538]  Because he goes directly to the people.
[01:44:20.078 --> 01:44:22.399]  Why is the Alex Jones programming effective?
[01:44:22.419 --> 01:44:24.199]  Because it goes directly to the people.
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:33.602]  And that's why it's so threatening to the mainstream media, which has CIA filters since Operation Mockingbird in the 50s, and still wants to give out.
[01:44:33.662 --> 01:44:34.542]  What about that paradigm?
[01:44:34.582 --> 01:44:36.983]  Because I'm not saying the agencies haven't done bad things.
[01:44:37.023 --> 01:44:40.004]  Some of them are unconstitutional and should be reformed or abolished.
[01:44:40.444 --> 01:44:46.827]  But most of the folks in the CIA and FBI and everywhere I run into are like totally know what's going on and are fighting this.
[01:44:47.347 --> 01:44:49.008]  It's the leadership that's bad.
[01:44:49.248 --> 01:44:55.551]  It's again, you've got an element within the CIA that is globalist and has been globalist from the very beginning.
[01:44:55.571 --> 01:45:00.913]  Since the British Empire set up the CIA out of the OSS, out of skull and bones.
[01:45:01.654 --> 01:45:06.616]  Alan Dulles, the whole Alger Hiss forming the United Nations.
[01:45:06.676 --> 01:45:08.537]  This was always... Rockefellers.
[01:45:09.257 --> 01:45:15.802]  Deep within the CIA, you know, these are people who were globalists from the very beginning.
[01:45:16.002 --> 01:45:17.023]  And they didn't want free market.
[01:45:17.063 --> 01:45:23.048]  They wanted multinationals above the law, tax exempt, everybody else under socialism or communism, so they could have full control.
[01:45:23.068 --> 01:45:23.788]  That's right.
[01:45:23.808 --> 01:45:27.451]  They were a global government since before World War II.
[01:45:27.491 --> 01:45:28.152]  For those that don't know,
[01:45:29.207 --> 01:45:34.712]  You know, turn of the century, the books of not just Huxley, but also H.G.
[01:45:34.772 --> 01:45:42.118]  Wells, the nonfiction, he wrote The New World Order, all these others, they had a competing world empire model with the Nazis by the 30s.
[01:45:42.818 --> 01:45:46.862]  And so if you go to the history books then, this was not denied they had 10 regions of America.
[01:45:47.182 --> 01:45:48.884]  It wasn't called FEMA, but it's the same regions.
[01:45:49.325 --> 01:45:53.631]  It wasn't denied that they had a global plan and that they were going to do all this.
[01:45:53.731 --> 01:46:02.323]  I mean, they've had a plan that basically the robber barons hatched about 130 years ago to control populations that never stopped because so much money got put into it.
[01:46:02.763 --> 01:46:19.068]  And from Woodrow Wilson on, Federal Reserve created 1913, the whole League of Nations idea, fighting this war, World War I, pushing us into World War I. All these things were globalist plans to ultimately come out and destroy sovereign nations.
[01:46:19.628 --> 01:46:24.152]  Now what's at stake today is you're seeing a dying structure.
[01:46:24.733 --> 01:46:28.377]  CIA is losing its power because it's being exposed.
[01:46:28.737 --> 01:46:32.441]  You're getting exposed within Washington the GOP establishment.
[01:46:32.901 --> 01:46:34.683]  Now Donald Trump's got to get him out of the White House.
[01:46:35.003 --> 01:46:37.225]  He's got to take control of the agencies.
[01:46:37.606 --> 01:46:38.847]  He's got to fire by half.
[01:46:40.268 --> 01:46:41.949]  The people who are working in Washington.
[01:46:42.069 --> 01:46:46.513]  And listen to the little globalist snot-noses who have been trained to hate America.
[01:46:46.793 --> 01:46:51.116]  If you just realize that's conditioning and get out of the way, you'll have prosperity, morons!
[01:46:51.316 --> 01:46:53.118]  Just get out of humanity's way!
[01:46:53.418 --> 01:46:54.299]  We don't want to kill you.
[01:46:54.679 --> 01:46:55.700]  Just get out of the way!
[01:46:55.940 --> 01:46:56.761]  Get out of the way!
[01:46:57.021 --> 01:46:57.541]  Get out!
[01:46:57.861 --> 01:46:58.742]  Satan, get behind me!
[01:46:58.942 --> 01:46:59.603]  Get out of the way!
[01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:04.073]  The power of the presidency is enormous and Donald Trump's going to start wielding it.
[01:47:04.093 --> 01:47:07.236]  I mean, if he's not going to use it, maybe he'll let us borrow it for a few days.
[01:47:07.716 --> 01:47:10.338]  I'd like to get rid of about half of the people in Washington.
[01:47:11.279 --> 01:47:14.061]  I don't know what he's... I mean, he's done so much good in his actions.
[01:47:14.302 --> 01:47:16.764]  I don't know how he's so bad about firing people.
[01:47:16.884 --> 01:47:17.865]  I'm betting on Donald Trump.
[01:47:17.885 --> 01:47:19.486]  Well, look, he fired Comey and all hell's breaking loose.
[01:47:19.686 --> 01:47:21.167]  I am betting on Donald Trump.
[01:47:21.668 --> 01:47:25.411]  Donald Trump, I've always said, looks like he's going to lose right up until the time he wins.
[01:47:25.791 --> 01:47:27.052]  Donald Trump always wins.
[01:47:56.072 --> 01:48:06.732]  And here she is, this is what's defeating them, is that people see the old, evil, decrepit, slimy Democratic Party, and not by old physically, just old in their corrupt ways.
[01:48:06.773 --> 01:48:07.133]  Here it is.
[01:48:08.308 --> 01:48:12.990]  Liberal extremists will stop at nothing to push their radical agenda.
[01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:19.773]  Now they're turning their attention to Georgia and demanding that you vote for John Ossoff for Congress.
[01:48:20.333 --> 01:48:22.194]  John Ossoff is one of them.
[01:48:23.115 --> 01:48:28.897]  Ossoff will vote with Nancy Pelosi for more spending, bigger government, and a weaker military.
[01:48:29.317 --> 01:48:32.058]  Don't let them hijack our congressional seat.
[01:48:32.559 --> 01:48:34.259]  Stop Ossoff now.
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:37.661]  Congressional Leadership Fund is responsible for the content of this advertising.
[01:48:39.062 --> 01:48:43.804]  Now, again, the Democrats, I've got the numbers here, spent 5-1, 10-1 in these last four races.
[01:48:43.824 --> 01:48:45.265]  We've got one more on Pelosi, don't we?
[01:48:49.506 --> 01:48:50.587]  I was told we had three of these ads.
[01:48:50.627 --> 01:48:51.447]  We have one more we can play?
[01:48:53.668 --> 01:48:55.089]  Let's go ahead and roll that ad.
[01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.389]  Here it is.
[01:48:56.462 --> 01:48:57.322]  When will it stop?
[01:48:57.602 --> 01:49:00.703]  Liberal extremists violently obstructing President Trump.
[01:49:01.024 --> 01:49:01.764]  They're childish.
[01:49:01.964 --> 01:49:02.664]  They're radical.
[01:49:02.864 --> 01:49:03.324]  D.C.
[01:49:03.424 --> 01:49:07.266]  liberals, Hollywood elites, this is who supports John Ossoff.
[01:49:07.526 --> 01:49:09.566]  Because John Ossoff is one of them.
[01:49:09.947 --> 01:49:10.467]  Childish.
[01:49:10.747 --> 01:49:11.287]  Radical.
[01:49:11.467 --> 01:49:13.708]  They've targeted Georgia, but we can stop them.
[01:49:14.028 --> 01:49:15.668]  We just need to vote.
[01:49:15.789 --> 01:49:18.489]  We can defeat Ossoff and the childish radicals.
[01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:19.670]  Vote today.
[01:49:19.690 --> 01:49:21.590]  Vote until June 20th.
[01:49:21.670 --> 01:49:23.651]  Vote against John Ossoff.
[01:49:24.051 --> 01:49:26.152]  NRCC is responsible for the content of this advertisement.
[01:49:26.352 --> 01:49:26.932]  Powerful!
[01:49:27.052 --> 01:49:48.661]  So, we know they've got illegals voting, they've got people voting in dead people's names, they've got, the computers are adding, in major studies I've got here, nine points more for Democrats, but despite all that, despite all that, despite 5.7 million illegals voting, Trump totally confirmed, almost double what he previously said, that was peer research, not him, not us, they say Trump claims, Infowars claims, no, the studies claim, the studies show,
[01:49:49.281 --> 01:49:58.543]  What are they going to do now, Dr. Corsi, that just despite all their threats and all their calls for death, there's $3 trillion in the stock market, the economy's coming back, people are waking up to them?
[01:49:58.763 --> 01:50:00.764]  Well, next comes martial law.
[01:50:01.284 --> 01:50:10.406]  Next comes the whole ability to try to say, okay, we've got MS-13 in the country, which was let in in massive numbers by President Obama.
[01:50:10.746 --> 01:50:22.950]  With 150,000 unaccompanied minors that were allowed into the country starting in 2014, in comes more MS-13, dominating the cities and creating a huge problem for the police.
[01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:28.312]  Obama was allowing illegal alien criminals out on the street.
[01:50:28.772 --> 01:50:30.512]  The Democrats wanted chaos.
[01:50:30.552 --> 01:50:31.833]  Remember, it's Saul Alinsky.
[01:50:32.253 --> 01:50:35.474]  They want to have chaos, they want to have violence, and then comes
[01:50:36.054 --> 01:50:41.496]  Oh, our solution, of course, is the DHS will take over all the state elections and we'll have martial law.
[01:50:41.816 --> 01:50:46.537]  And it's so transparent, the same game plan in Europe using Islamists.
[01:50:46.957 --> 01:50:48.158]  We're in Stockholm and everywhere.
[01:50:48.218 --> 01:50:56.540]  I've got articles when we come back where they're raping women at gunpoint on TV and they get one month in jail.
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:50:57.601]  One month.
[01:50:57.621 --> 01:51:02.302]  I mean, they're raping, kidnapping women on live stream and they get one month in jail.
[01:51:05.396 --> 01:51:07.300]  Dr. Shiva Ayodhya is our guest.
[01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:10.447]  He's got four degrees from MIT and others as well.
[01:51:10.587 --> 01:51:11.148]  Patriot.
[01:51:12.150 --> 01:51:16.720]  And he's running for Senate against the fake...
[01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:25.663]  Native American, of course they thought they found Indians, so they called the Native Americans Indians, but he's actually an Indian, so he's the real Indian running against the imposter.
[01:51:25.683 --> 01:51:27.484]  He's kind of used that as one of his slogans.
[01:51:28.165 --> 01:51:42.231]  Getting into the campaign to run against this lady, let's break down her record and what she's really up to and some of the things she's been involved in and what made you decide to go ahead and, you know, successful scientist, entrepreneur, to make you, you know, throw your hat in the ring.
[01:51:43.322 --> 01:51:48.224]  Well, you know, Alex, I grew up in, you know, I was originally born in India and I came here.
[01:51:48.644 --> 01:51:51.446]  As you may know, Alex, India has a very oppressive caste system.
[01:51:51.826 --> 01:52:04.111]  So my parents had this very futuristic vision and they made it out in there and they came to America because the founders of this country had a very different vision for America, which was through your hard work, through your bravery, through your resilience, you created things.
[01:52:04.151 --> 01:52:05.672]  And that's what this country is about.
[01:52:06.272 --> 01:52:12.797]  Well, and the idea of the Founders was that between us and our Creator was not supposed to be monarchs and nobles, the priesthood.
[01:52:13.098 --> 01:52:17.541]  It was about us having a direct connection to our God and our Creator, and that's what makes this country great.
[01:52:17.962 --> 01:52:27.630]  Elizabeth Warren and the self-serving elitists, Harvard and all these Ivy League institutions and the big institutions, fundamentally believe that they know better, Alex.
[01:52:28.010 --> 01:52:30.352]  And I know you know better, I know we know better.
[01:52:30.772 --> 01:52:32.153]  But that's the fundamental reason.
[01:52:32.173 --> 01:52:44.743]  So my journey as an entrepreneur, scientist, engineer, has shown me that ultimately those people actually work for a living, produce things, entrepreneurs, people like yourself who create things, are the ones that make this country great.
[01:52:45.003 --> 01:52:50.567]  People like Elizabeth Warren, the establishment politicians of political hacks, they fundamentally add zero value.
[01:52:50.968 --> 01:52:53.790]  So I've been fortunate because of this great country, Alex,
[01:52:54.210 --> 01:52:57.773]  To have, you know, accumulated wealth, been able to get educated.
[01:52:57.813 --> 01:53:00.555]  I could not have done that in the oppressive caste system of India.
[01:53:00.575 --> 01:53:01.996]  So I believe I owe something back.
[01:53:02.076 --> 01:53:02.957]  I love this country.
[01:53:03.397 --> 01:53:06.880]  And Elizabeth Warren is what I call the not-so-obvious establishment.
[01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:15.026]  You know, when we look at the arc of political history, we have the establishment, the populist movement, those people on the streets wanting a better day for themselves and their family.
[01:53:15.346 --> 01:53:17.448]  Then you have the not-so-obvious establishment.
[01:53:17.828 --> 01:53:21.032]  Which is what Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, these people represent.
[01:53:21.333 --> 01:53:22.654]  They speak a good game.
[01:53:23.075 --> 01:53:26.279]  You know, as you talk about it, they're very, very clever with their PR.
[01:53:26.679 --> 01:53:28.061]  Revolution, hope, change.
[01:53:28.321 --> 01:53:32.987]  But fundamentally, they want to suck out the populist movement and drive it back to the establishment.
[01:53:33.407 --> 01:53:35.830]  So as a student of systems, as a student of science,
[01:53:36.691 --> 01:53:38.313]  I fundamentally want to stop these guys.
[01:53:38.373 --> 01:53:41.915]  And more importantly, I want to drive a massive defeat to Warren.
[01:53:41.935 --> 01:53:44.617]  And I know I can do this right here in Massachusetts.
[01:53:44.657 --> 01:53:47.580]  And I think people like Elizabeth Warren need to be stopped.
[01:53:47.920 --> 01:54:02.231]  And I believe that I was in many ways, my hardworking grandparents, my parents, and this great country and the fathers of this country put me and gave me this opportunity at this point in history to stop someone like Warren to basically support this new American revolution.
[01:54:03.919 --> 01:54:06.902]  Ladies and gentlemen... I cannot...
[01:54:27.481 --> 01:54:30.964]  Don't over exaggerate how incredible this historic time is right now.
[01:54:31.344 --> 01:54:32.846]  I mean, it's over the top.
[01:54:33.586 --> 01:54:49.480]  And so many people are like bored, they're not political, and then those that are political on the left are just frothing like they personally got raped and robbed because their identity is they're liberals, they're the elite, they're the intellectuals, they run flyover country, you know, where granny's cooking possum pie.
[01:54:50.336 --> 01:54:55.638]  I mean, a lot of people I meet from New York and stuff who are great folks, but kind of the liberals, they think we ride horses to work down here.
[01:54:55.678 --> 01:55:02.681]  They don't know there's, you know, super colliders and nuclear weapons and, you know, oil fields and science and technology and NASA.
[01:55:02.922 --> 01:55:05.763]  They think that we wipe, you know, our asses with our hands or something.
[01:55:06.223 --> 01:55:13.446]  And I just feel so sorry for them that now their whole identity that kind of these cavemen out there, they love the Muslim, you know, invaders.
[01:55:13.466 --> 01:55:14.547]  They're good in culture.
[01:55:14.887 --> 01:55:17.608]  But the horrible Texans and others, they've got to be defeated!
[01:55:18.228 --> 01:55:19.169]  They've got to be crushed!
[01:55:20.114 --> 01:55:34.127]  We're going to go back to Dr. Courtsey here to talk about battle plans and where this is going ahead of Colonel Schaefer joining us with big intel on the leaked plans that the Democrats have now been exposed as having to have a violent overthrow, civil unrest, martial law now going mainstream.
[01:55:34.167 --> 01:55:36.970]  Everything we've warned of for years now out in the open.
[01:55:37.811 --> 01:55:40.834]  See, I've been trying to warn the public so they'd recognize this if it ever arose.
[01:55:40.854 --> 01:55:42.075]  It's one of the main threats.
[01:55:42.115 --> 01:55:42.896]  Now before we go any further,
[01:55:43.885 --> 01:55:45.666]  We're running 4th of July specials.
[01:55:45.706 --> 01:55:48.327]  I'm extending free shipping only a few more days.

[01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:17.990]  You don't absorb it, or it's toxic.
[01:56:18.210 --> 01:56:18.751]  This is pure.
[01:56:18.771 --> 01:56:19.271]  This is clean.
[01:56:19.291 --> 01:56:20.072]  Nobody else has got it.
[01:56:20.412 --> 01:56:22.414]  Z-Shield, to detoxify heavy metals and more.
[01:56:22.714 --> 01:56:23.354]  Our new product, 30% off.

[01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:56.531]  888-253-3139.
[01:56:57.651 --> 01:57:03.275]  No matter who you are, I want to thank you all for your support and your prayers.
[01:57:03.295 --> 01:57:03.755]  888-253-3139.
[01:57:04.055 --> 01:57:07.197]  These are war bonds.
[01:57:07.238 --> 01:57:08.198]  We want to expand.
[01:57:08.538 --> 01:57:09.459]  I'm hiring more people.
[01:57:09.479 --> 01:57:11.820]  We want to open bureaus.
[01:57:12.161 --> 01:57:14.282]  We're self-funded by you.
[01:57:14.422 --> 01:57:16.623]  You are the Infowars, so we salute you.
[01:57:16.924 --> 01:57:18.525]  Gerald, we're going to break in a few minutes, but
[01:57:19.105 --> 01:57:24.008]  Looking at their defeats, looking at their panicking, looking at their insanity, looking at how they operate like a cult.
[01:57:24.108 --> 01:57:26.649]  Even liberals are leaving now, saying they've gone insane.
[01:57:26.949 --> 01:57:28.190]  What's happened to these people?
[01:57:28.510 --> 01:57:30.251]  Well, they've just gotten more determined.
[01:57:30.271 --> 01:57:31.312]  They're going to get more violent.
[01:57:31.772 --> 01:57:33.933]  They're training people to go disrupt the town halls.
[01:57:33.973 --> 01:57:34.413]  Look at this.
[01:57:34.493 --> 01:57:39.156]  Every town hall with these Democratic-trained disruptors trying to prevent.
[01:57:39.336 --> 01:57:41.397]  And they never say anything because they're robots.
[01:57:41.417 --> 01:57:42.237]  They just do dumb chants.
[01:57:42.458 --> 01:57:44.559]  We should all go to town halls and elegantly speak.
[01:57:45.479 --> 01:57:46.740]  And they're trained to do this.
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:48.380]  This is all Soros training.
[01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:50.181]  They're recruited, they're trained, they're paid.
[01:57:50.201 --> 01:57:52.041]  You're going to see violence in the street.
[01:57:52.061 --> 01:57:53.762]  You're going to see violent demonstrations.
[01:57:54.182 --> 01:58:07.647]  Wait until we get more Hispanic demonstrations on trying to get MS-13 out of the country, which Obama allowed to get in the country, along with releasing from prisons illegal immigrants who are criminals.
[01:58:08.167 --> 01:58:09.367]  This was a concerted effort.
[01:58:09.387 --> 01:58:09.947]  Half a million.
[01:58:10.227 --> 01:58:10.808]  Half a million.
[01:58:11.168 --> 01:58:14.469]  Concerted effort to cause America to be less safe.
[01:58:15.369 --> 01:58:18.130]  More incidents, I'm sure, of radical Islamic terrorism.
[01:58:18.570 --> 01:58:19.530]  And again, under-reported.
[01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:20.670]  And that's what I meant to get to.
[01:58:20.690 --> 01:58:22.190]  We're going to get into what's happening in Europe.
[01:58:22.471 --> 01:58:23.271]  The same model.
[01:58:23.311 --> 01:58:24.591]  I mean, it's so- Same model.
[01:58:25.051 --> 01:58:31.472]  They're bringing in a disruptive class into Europe because they want to destroy the peace and security of the Europeans.
[01:58:31.512 --> 01:58:32.773]  Because they want to bring a police state in.
[01:58:32.873 --> 01:58:35.313]  Theresa May wants internet censorship and more.
[01:58:35.353 --> 01:58:36.313]  She is a monster.
[01:58:36.853 --> 01:58:38.314]  Again, it's not just leftists and the enemy.
[01:58:38.334 --> 01:58:41.754]  It's these fake conservatives that use Islam to take our liberties.
[01:58:41.774 --> 01:58:41.814]  No!
[01:58:41.895 --> 01:58:43.635]  No, don't take our liberties!
[01:58:44.375 --> 01:58:49.557]  Take people in their nightgowns and their beekeeper suits and let them stay in their cesspits.
[01:58:49.697 --> 01:58:53.759]  Let them stay there and chop their genitals off and crap on each other and throw gays off buildings.
[01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:59.182]  Protect your skin with SPF 30 sunscreen lotion by Emrix Essentials.
[01:58:59.702 --> 01:59:06.785]  Perfect for face and body, this natural unscented sunscreen can be worn at all times of the day, whenever you need sun protection.
[01:59:06.865 --> 01:59:12.467]  We source ingredients from nature, producing a product free of harmful chemicals and toxins.
[01:59:12.747 --> 01:59:20.570]  This natural lotion contains 21% zinc oxide, which is the largest particle size used, and we do not use nanoparticles.
[01:59:21.070 --> 01:59:24.031]  The larger the particle, the safer it is for your body.
[01:59:24.592 --> 01:59:28.513]  The organic oils help hydrate the skin, leaving it nice and smooth.
[01:59:28.733 --> 01:59:32.935]  The truly natural fragrance-free sunscreen for the most sensitive skin.
[01:59:33.175 --> 01:59:38.838]  Emrix Essentials wants you to enjoy the sun and strives to bring you organic products to enhance your life.
[01:59:39.378 --> 01:59:44.300]  Naturally protect your skin with SPF 30 sunscreen lotion by Emrix Essentials.
[01:59:44.541 --> 01:59:47.522]  Stop exposing yourself and your family to toxic ingredients.
[01:59:47.822 --> 01:59:53.165]  Visit Infowarsstore.com and learn more about the new SPF 30 sunscreen lotion.
[01:59:55.507 --> 02:00:01.410]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.483 --> 02:00:20.887]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[02:00:54.586 --> 02:01:07.071]  Also tonight, a soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office.
[02:01:07.591 --> 02:01:13.673]  Sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear and present danger.
[02:01:14.193 --> 02:01:16.234]  That is tonight's very important opening monologue.
[02:01:18.166 --> 02:01:24.389]  And then the Washington Post points out that basically the monologue, part of it is taken directly from my statement a month before.
[02:01:24.929 --> 02:01:26.990]  But it's not taken from my statement.
[02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:28.551]  This is what the President's discussing.
[02:01:28.611 --> 02:01:29.432]  He knows about this.
[02:01:29.452 --> 02:01:34.154]  In the times I've been blessed enough to speak to the President, this is what we talk about if people really want to know.
[02:01:34.174 --> 02:01:36.315]  I never really told the media because I don't want to get into private discussions.
[02:01:36.715 --> 02:01:38.456]  But that's, the President is aware of this.
[02:01:39.156 --> 02:01:40.777]  Large sections of the military are aware.
[02:01:41.157 --> 02:01:45.560]  Most of the agencies, at least the folks that actually do the work, are aware.
[02:01:46.660 --> 02:01:47.381]  I don't
[02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:06.632]  Because I guess in this one case, it's not a dereliction of duty if it's the president.
[02:02:07.092 --> 02:02:19.821]  But I understand we don't want to be like fascists, but if they're calling for overthrow, murder, death, overthrowing elections, having a homeland security dictatorship, then the FBI being the fourth branch of government, then the president really has to move.
[02:02:20.201 --> 02:02:23.444]  And I understand, first he's got to get rid of all the traitors, and then move.
[02:02:23.484 --> 02:02:29.368]  But if they're all just in mutiny against him, knowing that's his move, and they all just ignore his orders, what do we do?
[02:02:29.648 --> 02:02:32.390]  Well, basically, I mean, let's look at this whole Comey situation.
[02:02:34.011 --> 02:02:35.392]  First of all, this is a coup d'etat.
[02:02:35.913 --> 02:02:38.295]  It's an attempt to remove the President of the United States.
[02:02:38.315 --> 02:02:39.496]  Isn't it big to have Hannity saying that?
[02:02:39.857 --> 02:02:40.597]  It is terrific.
[02:02:40.958 --> 02:02:44.281]  I'm proud of Hannity to come forward and say this.
[02:02:44.801 --> 02:02:46.623]  And it does risk his career at Fox.
[02:02:47.384 --> 02:02:50.967]  Hannity is finally getting on the front lines on this.
[02:02:52.128 --> 02:02:52.928]  Comey's fired.
[02:02:52.988 --> 02:02:54.909]  Okay, and so the mainstream media goes nuts.
[02:02:55.269 --> 02:02:56.089]  Who cares?
[02:02:56.329 --> 02:02:57.189]  Unplug them.
[02:02:57.249 --> 02:02:58.569]  Get them out of the press room.
[02:02:58.909 --> 02:03:00.610]  Let them ask their questions of each other.
[02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:01.670]  Ignore them.
[02:03:02.130 --> 02:03:03.610]  Mainstream media isn't being listened to.
[02:03:03.650 --> 02:03:05.411]  They're a dying legacy industry.
[02:03:05.811 --> 02:03:07.771]  Who cares what the mainstream media says?
[02:03:08.171 --> 02:03:09.131]  Fire these people.
[02:03:09.572 --> 02:03:11.732]  Take control of the government.
[02:03:11.812 --> 02:03:13.212]  What does he do if they try to kill him?
[02:03:13.672 --> 02:03:15.853]  Well, that's the next thing they'll try to do.
[02:03:16.809 --> 02:03:20.031]  And I've been warning about that for a long time, and you have too.
[02:03:20.091 --> 02:03:28.455]  I'm telling you, if they take shots at him or something, all the people that have been calling for his death and ignoring him, I think under national security, we arrest the top thousand of these people.
[02:03:28.655 --> 02:03:32.077]  And look, what's the Secret Service and the Department of Justice doing?
[02:03:32.117 --> 02:03:36.619]  People call up congressmen and give them death threats, and they don't get investigated?
[02:03:36.639 --> 02:03:37.579]  And they have their phone number.
[02:03:37.820 --> 02:03:38.920]  They don't get investigated?
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.301]  What's the Department of Justice doing?
[02:03:40.341 --> 02:03:42.042]  Go out and investigate these people.
[02:03:42.402 --> 02:03:44.603]  People who are threatening the President are committing a crime.
[02:03:44.623 --> 02:03:46.244]  Well, the Justice Department has been packed.
[02:03:46.764 --> 02:03:48.084]  For decades with globalists.
[02:03:48.244 --> 02:03:49.165]  And get rid of them.
[02:03:49.265 --> 02:03:57.107]  It's, you know, CIA, Kord Meier, he was a world globalist early on in the 1949-50 period.
[02:03:57.527 --> 02:03:59.788]  The CIA has been packed with globalists.
[02:03:59.828 --> 02:04:02.729]  The whole agenda has been to destroy the United States.
[02:04:02.789 --> 02:04:06.410]  And Obama... And Kennedy got rid of Kord Meier, and he was one of the main guys.
[02:04:06.450 --> 02:04:10.951]  Look, E. Howard Hunt named Kord Meier... Yeah, but didn't Kennedy have sex with Kord Meier's wife?
[02:04:11.931 --> 02:04:12.172]  Yes.
[02:04:13.972 --> 02:04:16.134]  I mean, Kennedy did have sex with most people's wives.
[02:04:16.174 --> 02:04:17.055]  Well, he actually did.
[02:04:17.075 --> 02:04:22.860]  But, you know, Mary Myers was killed then, afterward, after the assassination of Jack Kennedy.
[02:04:23.300 --> 02:04:23.860]  She was offed.
[02:04:24.021 --> 02:04:27.864]  I was just a benchwarmer on the operation.
[02:04:27.924 --> 02:04:30.046]  What did you make of E. Howard Hunt's deathbed confession?
[02:04:30.066 --> 02:04:31.547]  Well, I thought there was a lot of truth to it.
[02:04:31.647 --> 02:04:32.107]  Well, he was there.
[02:04:32.127 --> 02:04:32.788]  He got photographed.
[02:04:32.828 --> 02:04:33.448]  I think there's a lot.
[02:04:33.468 --> 02:04:36.190]  Yes, he can be seen at the assassination site.
[02:04:36.230 --> 02:04:37.171]  I'm confident of it.
[02:04:37.491 --> 02:04:38.271]  I've seen the photos.
[02:04:38.311 --> 02:04:40.633]  But look, this is deadly serious stuff.
[02:04:41.093 --> 02:04:44.616]  And Donald Trump has got to protect himself by getting a hold of the government.
[02:04:44.636 --> 02:04:48.398]  Well, I'm just saying, they're openly in sedition, saying, overthrow the government, kill everybody.
[02:04:48.698 --> 02:04:50.860]  They've got communists marching everywhere with guns out.
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:51.921]  They're killing cops.
[02:04:52.501 --> 02:04:55.783]  I mean, people, they go, you're Mr. Anti-Police State.
[02:04:55.823 --> 02:04:56.564]  Now you want to... No!
[02:04:56.824 --> 02:04:58.365]  The police state comes, we let them win.
[02:04:58.385 --> 02:05:01.327]  We have to move against this cancer with the police.
[02:05:03.908 --> 02:05:09.730]  Donald Trump just held a rally in Iowa, and one of the people in attendance, our anonymous sources say, was Bill Clinton.
[02:05:09.790 --> 02:05:11.091]  Well, how do we know it was Bill Clinton?
[02:05:11.131 --> 02:05:21.135]  Because while Trump was sending his thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise and the other three Americans who were shot at the ball field by a deranged Bernie supporter, Democratic operatives began blowing their Bill Clinton rape whistles.
[02:05:21.415 --> 02:05:26.938]  I'd like to also take this moment to send our thoughts and prayers to our courageous friend.
[02:05:28.078 --> 02:05:31.500]  Somebody that I've gotten to know very well, Steve Scalise.
[02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:32.161]  Right?
[02:05:32.221 --> 02:05:38.204]  Because that's the only reason you would try to interrupt a president as he was sending out his thoughts and prayers to somebody who had recently been shot, right?
[02:05:38.244 --> 02:05:39.185]  Come on, work with me here.
[02:05:39.245 --> 02:05:41.386]  The Democrats can't even protest right.
[02:05:41.446 --> 02:05:42.627]  These people fail at everything.
[02:05:42.647 --> 02:05:46.709]  They lose elections, they lose public support, and now they look like thoughtless cowards.
[02:05:46.969 --> 02:05:47.930]  It's just as Trump said.
[02:05:47.950 --> 02:05:48.970]  Never fails.
[02:05:51.172 --> 02:05:51.712]  Never fails.
[02:05:52.190 --> 02:05:53.991]  You can check out the video on InfoWars.com.
[02:05:54.031 --> 02:05:57.774]  Protesters blow whistles as Trump sends thoughts and prayers to Representative Steve Scalise.
[02:05:57.954 --> 02:05:59.555]  And that part about Bill Clinton being in the audience?
[02:05:59.795 --> 02:06:00.536]  That was fake news.
[02:06:00.816 --> 02:06:03.278]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:06:04.218 --> 02:06:13.265]  The supporters of InfoWars, not just here in the U.S., but around the world, are the cutting-edge vanguard of the reawakening of a sleeping giant that is human liberty.

[02:07:35.327 --> 02:07:41.831]  On that particular special at 40% off, if you get the additional auto ship 10% off, we're talking about a lost leader.
[02:07:42.372 --> 02:07:57.482]  This July 4th, celebrating our republic, celebrating worldwide freedom, and celebrating returning America to its place in the world as a true shining city on a hill where people want to come here to celebrate free market and an open society.
[02:07:57.802 --> 02:08:03.765]  Not to celebrate a globalist, politically correct cesspool of infighting and mind control.
[02:08:04.546 --> 02:08:15.692]  He never gives up.
[02:08:16.032 --> 02:08:20.874]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas worldwide.
[02:08:24.707 --> 02:08:33.078]  Well, Karen Handel won a fourth special election despite record Democratic money in any election ever spent to defeat her.
[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:36.782]  Still, Jon Ossoff lost.
[02:08:37.737 --> 02:08:39.018]  What does this tell us?
[02:08:39.138 --> 02:08:40.560]  Well, we know the polls are fake.
[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:41.461]  Trump's way above 50%.
[02:08:41.581 --> 02:08:45.244]  They're doing a 9-15% sampling rate higher for Democrats.
[02:08:45.284 --> 02:08:46.606]  They're calling people on landlines.
[02:08:47.006 --> 02:08:47.887]  They already have an index.
[02:08:47.907 --> 02:08:48.908]  They know we're Democrats.
[02:08:49.489 --> 02:08:51.130]  I think Trump's got 60% support.
[02:08:51.591 --> 02:08:52.872]  As long as the stock market holds.
[02:08:52.912 --> 02:08:56.816]  The problem is there's major underlying economic, global, financial problems.
[02:08:57.416 --> 02:09:00.339]  We've got the new main streets having problems.
[02:09:00.359 --> 02:09:01.821]  We've got the commercial real estate.
[02:09:02.748 --> 02:09:03.549]  Beginning to implode.
[02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:05.290]  Amazon's a big part of that.
[02:09:06.270 --> 02:09:12.034]  So, as Ron Paul said like a month ago, he said Trump's doing great with his policies on the economy, in my view, but too little, too late.
[02:09:12.094 --> 02:09:20.920]  Now, somebody who was the chief advisor to Ron Paul on his presidential campaign when it came to finance is Peter Schiff, Billions Under Management at EuroPAC.com.
[02:09:21.460 --> 02:09:25.903]  And of course, no stranger to this show or cable TV or broadcast TV, you name it.
[02:09:26.363 --> 02:09:31.587]  And so I want to get his nuanced take on this because, look, I want to cheerlead the economy.
[02:09:32.367 --> 02:09:39.450]  And I see Trump bringing back a lot of jobs and exuberance in the stock market, but underlying, globally, a lot of problems.
[02:09:39.911 --> 02:09:42.192]  And so we'll get Peter Schiff's take on that.
[02:09:42.412 --> 02:09:43.332]  Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[02:09:43.973 --> 02:09:46.594]  So, Peter Schiff, where do you think we are right now?
[02:09:47.722 --> 02:09:56.044]  Well, you know, nice to see Alex, it's been a while, but, you know, I think candidate Trump had a lot better or more accurate view of the U.S.
[02:09:56.104 --> 02:10:06.507]  economy than President Trump, because candidate Trump was a lot more accurate in criticizing the phony numbers that the government used to try to paint a rosy picture of the economy.
[02:10:06.547 --> 02:10:11.108]  He was very critical of the way the government measured and reported unemployment.
[02:10:11.628 --> 02:10:12.348]  Inflation.
[02:10:27.675 --> 02:10:28.736]  That's what got him elected.
[02:10:28.756 --> 02:10:37.682]  I mean, that resonated with the public that had been spoon-fed nonsense by the administration about how great the economy was when they knew it was lousy.
[02:10:37.782 --> 02:10:41.645]  And now Trump is president and he is spoon-feeding the same nonsense.
[02:10:41.965 --> 02:10:46.128]  We haven't had a huge turnaround in the economy since he's been elected.
[02:10:46.489 --> 02:10:48.290]  There has been an improvement in sentiment.
[02:10:48.570 --> 02:10:55.435]  There are people who believe that things are going to get better because they remain hopeful that things are going to happen, but nothing has actually happened.
[02:11:19.271 --> 02:11:20.572]  I don't think we're having success.
[02:11:20.633 --> 02:11:28.562]  I think, yes, we're having success and not having even more failure than we might have if Hillary Clinton were president or Barack Obama.
[02:11:28.582 --> 02:11:29.643]  Well, exactly, exactly.
[02:11:29.703 --> 02:11:32.266]  So has Trump been given almost like a sinking ship?
[02:11:33.103 --> 02:11:34.764]  Yes, he has been given a sinking ship.
[02:11:35.084 --> 02:11:37.746]  I wish he would level with the public that it is sinking.
[02:11:38.086 --> 02:11:40.047]  Because he's now claiming that it's seaworthy.
[02:11:40.347 --> 02:11:41.988]  The problem is, it's going down.
[02:11:42.028 --> 02:11:47.452]  And when he's at the helm, if he's telling us how great it is, and then it goes down, he's going to get the blame for it.
[02:11:47.712 --> 02:11:48.252]  He needs to...
[02:11:50.223 --> 02:11:54.845]  He needs to point out that the ship is still sinking and it needs serious repair.
[02:11:55.025 --> 02:11:56.206]  And so far we're not doing it.
[02:11:56.526 --> 02:11:57.106]  Dr. Corsi?
[02:11:57.586 --> 02:12:00.927]  Well, I mean, I think I want to give Donald Trump credit for a couple things.
[02:12:00.947 --> 02:12:08.511]  I mean, I think these regulations are very important to get rid of the EPA regulations, to get the economy so it can move.
[02:12:09.651 --> 02:12:12.213]  Whole emphasis on bringing jobs back to the United States.
[02:12:12.593 --> 02:12:17.657]  Clearly the Federal Reserve is trying to stack the deck against President Trump, raising interest rates.
[02:12:18.257 --> 02:12:33.347]  It's going to be critical that Trump gets discipline on Congress, gets a hold of the RNC money, so that they can't have these guaranteed funds for the RNC to run for re-election, and pushes through a major tax reform.
[02:12:33.367 --> 02:12:34.188]  It's going to be critical.
[02:12:34.228 --> 02:12:36.470]  Well sure, I don't want to ask Peter about that, but undoubtedly
[02:12:37.190 --> 02:12:38.531]  Trump wanted low interest rates.
[02:12:39.132 --> 02:12:41.414]  I was against them because it hurts real investors.
[02:12:41.474 --> 02:12:53.145]  But if the globalists gave themselves free interest forever, and economies in cardiac arrest want to have a few years of low interest rates, so if Yellen is about to raise rates again and that hurts the overall recovery, then why hasn't he removed Yellen?
[02:12:53.446 --> 02:12:57.029]  Or does Peter think we should go ahead and raise rates and then that gets into the tax cuts?
[02:12:57.049 --> 02:12:57.390]  Go ahead, Peter.
[02:12:58.151 --> 02:13:00.011]  Well, first of all, he can't remove her yet.
[02:13:00.031 --> 02:13:02.112]  I mean, her term is going to expire at some point.
[02:13:02.132 --> 02:13:03.892]  He doesn't have to re-nominate her.
[02:13:03.952 --> 02:13:05.133]  He can nominate somebody else.
[02:13:05.393 --> 02:13:12.134]  But it's interesting that during the entire term where Obama was president, the Fed really only raised rates once.
[02:13:12.154 --> 02:13:15.515]  I mean, they raised them a second time, but that's after the election.
[02:13:15.795 --> 02:13:19.816]  Since Trump was elected, they've already had three rate hikes, and they're planning on doing more.
[02:13:20.056 --> 02:13:22.337]  But the low interest rates were part of the problem.
[02:13:22.617 --> 02:13:27.403]  The Fed needs to raise interest rates, but when they do that, the economy is going to collapse.
[02:13:27.443 --> 02:13:29.706]  The whole bubble, the recovery was phony.
[02:13:29.746 --> 02:13:32.469]  We don't want to keep the phony recovery going.
[02:13:32.729 --> 02:13:37.134]  We want to let it implode so we can have a real recovery built on a solid foundation.
[02:13:37.154 --> 02:13:39.718]  Sure, but Trump's argument is, we only gave the bubble to the elites.
[02:13:40.118 --> 02:13:41.520]  Why not give some bubble to the people?
[02:13:42.703 --> 02:13:44.084]  Well, the people don't want a bubble.
[02:13:44.104 --> 02:13:45.666]  They want genuine prosperity.
[02:13:45.946 --> 02:13:50.170]  They don't want to be deluded into thinking that things are getting better as they're actually getting worse.
[02:13:50.210 --> 02:13:55.174]  The only way to have a real recovery is going to have massive cuts in government spending.
[02:13:55.434 --> 02:13:57.836]  And Donald Trump wants to increase government spending.
[02:13:57.996 --> 02:13:59.498]  He's talking about spending more money.
[02:14:00.118 --> 02:14:02.781]  His argument is it's a tax cut to slash regulations.
[02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:05.083]  I mean, isn't that one of the purest tax cuts there is?
[02:14:05.783 --> 02:14:09.084]  Well, look, we need to get rid of regulations, and I wish we could.
[02:14:09.104 --> 02:14:10.765]  Look, we can't even get rid of Obamacare.
[02:14:10.985 --> 02:14:13.406]  I mean, they want to replace it with something that's almost as bad.
[02:14:13.466 --> 02:14:14.367]  It might even be worse.
[02:14:14.407 --> 02:14:15.307]  No, no, I agree with you.
[02:14:15.327 --> 02:14:16.567]  That's the one big ding on Trump.
[02:14:16.587 --> 02:14:20.049]  That's the one big ding is this Obamacare thing has not been a real reform so far.
[02:14:20.109 --> 02:14:21.209]  So let me ask you this, Peter Schiff.
[02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:27.592]  What do you think would have happened if Hillary was in with her policies she was saying, and then A, and then B, what do you think Trump should do?
[02:14:28.971 --> 02:14:37.113]  Well look, I think if Hillary had won, a lot of the optimism surrounding the prospect of lower taxes and deregulation wouldn't be there.
[02:14:37.693 --> 02:14:44.834]  And my guess is that the Fed, that claims to be data dependent, would not have been raising interest rates in the face of this horrible data.
[02:14:45.174 --> 02:14:54.516]  So I do think that politics are playing a role here, and I think a reason that the Fed is ignoring the weak data is because they're not afraid of collapsing the bubble on Trump's watch.
[02:14:54.616 --> 02:14:55.277]  Incredible.
[02:14:55.337 --> 02:14:56.118]  That's what I think.
[02:15:15.740 --> 02:15:32.974]  Well, I said once we go back into recession and they can maybe blame it on Trump, you know, especially since Trump has made the mistake of pinning his presidency on the stock market or this economy when the economy tanks and the stock market tanks and now the Fed can try to save it and say, look, look what Donald Trump did.
[02:15:33.014 --> 02:15:36.877]  He wrecked this great economy and now we have to come bail him out.
[02:15:36.917 --> 02:15:38.158]  We have to do more QE.
[02:15:38.178 --> 02:15:39.379]  We have to cut interest rates.
[02:15:39.799 --> 02:15:49.913]  And that may lay a foundation for, you know, Democrats to run against Trump and how he wrecked the economy in the midterm elections and then again in the president for 2020.
[02:15:50.413 --> 02:15:51.495]  That's the plan.
[02:15:52.076 --> 02:15:52.997]  That's total veritas.
[02:15:53.017 --> 02:15:55.821]  I'm going to get out of course his brief take on that but pulling back
[02:15:57.062 --> 02:15:59.044]  What are they going to do losing all these special elections?
[02:15:59.084 --> 02:15:59.805]  People hate them.
[02:15:59.825 --> 02:16:01.666]  They're the new regional party of the coastlines.
[02:16:02.107 --> 02:16:03.148]  That's their answer.
[02:16:03.588 --> 02:16:05.590]  You can see it in the Federal Reserve's political actions.
[02:16:05.970 --> 02:16:06.991]  Tank the economy.
[02:16:07.391 --> 02:16:08.312]  Blame it on Trump.
[02:16:08.793 --> 02:16:13.056]  And then in 2018, have the Democrats take back the House and the Senate.
[02:16:13.076 --> 02:16:13.257]  Peter?
[02:16:14.042 --> 02:16:17.443]  Yeah, remember though, they're not tanking a real economy, they're pricking their own bubble.
[02:16:17.543 --> 02:16:20.644]  And then they're going to try to refill it with air, but it's not going to work.
[02:16:20.664 --> 02:16:24.185]  See, that's what I think is going to backfire on them.
[02:16:24.445 --> 02:16:27.466]  When they attempt to reflate this bubble, it's not going to work.
[02:16:27.706 --> 02:16:29.626]  That's what's going to bring on the dollar crisis.
[02:16:29.686 --> 02:16:32.907]  The dollar is going to tank, inflation is going to run out of control.
[02:16:32.927 --> 02:16:33.607]  I agree.
[02:16:34.267 --> 02:16:35.428]  And this is all going to happen.
[02:16:35.508 --> 02:16:37.688]  It should have happened years ago, but it didn't.
[02:16:37.768 --> 02:16:39.649]  We were able to delay the day of reckoning
[02:16:39.969 --> 02:16:44.892]  And Barack Obama got out of Dodge, and his whole house of cards is going to come down around Donald Trump.
[02:16:45.213 --> 02:16:50.717]  That's why, again, I wish that he was more, you know, leveled with the public about the gravity of these problems.
[02:16:50.737 --> 02:16:53.018]  Sure, but imagine being him.
[02:16:53.118 --> 02:17:01.984]  He knows they're going to blame him, and all he's trying to do is prop it up, and while he gets industry back, so that there is something there when it all implodes, that's more of a soft landing.
[02:17:02.085 --> 02:17:03.906]  Or are you saying that the bubble's getting bigger?
[02:17:04.875 --> 02:17:05.895]  There is no soft landing.
[02:17:05.935 --> 02:17:06.836]  It's a crash landing.
[02:17:06.856 --> 02:17:09.676]  I mean, what we have to do is make sure we can even walk away from the crash.
[02:17:09.956 --> 02:17:14.098]  But he needs to level with the American public on the degree that we need to sacrifice.
[02:17:14.398 --> 02:17:17.619]  He can't keep saying that we're going to increase defense spending.
[02:17:17.659 --> 02:17:18.659]  We're too broke for that.
[02:17:18.839 --> 02:17:21.120]  He can't keep promising more money for infrastructure.
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:22.000]  We don't have it.
[02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:23.800]  We need to make cuts to entitlements.
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:26.221]  He can't say Social Security and Medicare are off the table.
[02:17:26.441 --> 02:17:27.681]  They have to be on the table.
[02:17:27.701 --> 02:17:28.902]  Now, that was bad a few weeks ago.
[02:17:29.903 --> 02:17:35.112]  I mean, he's like, I have a big heart, so this Obamacare is going to have a bunch of free stuff in it.
[02:17:35.172 --> 02:17:35.953]  We don't have the money.
[02:17:37.025 --> 02:17:53.050]  Well, I mean, again, Peter's right also that the entire bubble was created by Obama with zero interest rates and this quantitative easing, which people don't realize is the Fed's balance sheet ballooned with the Fed buying Treasury debt.
[02:17:53.090 --> 02:17:59.432]  We bought our own debt in order to keep the Obama doubling the national debt to $20 trillion.
[02:17:59.952 --> 02:18:03.113]  It was a huge ride on borrowed money.
[02:18:03.133 --> 02:18:04.234]  Let me ask Peter this then.
[02:18:05.214 --> 02:18:07.795]  What's your timetable, hypothetically, and what do you see happening?
[02:18:08.576 --> 02:18:12.137]  Well, look, you know, now the Fed is promising quantitative tightening, right?
[02:18:12.157 --> 02:18:18.040]  So while the Fed was monetizing the Obama deficits, they don't want to monetize the Trump deficits.
[02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:30.646]  They want to make the Trump deficits even bigger by forcing the Trump administration not only to have to finance the national debt, the budget deficits, but to borrow enough money to repay all the money the Fed borrowed when Obama was president.
[02:18:30.666 --> 02:18:32.167]  So clearly the elites are against Trump.
[02:18:32.447 --> 02:18:33.487]  Clearly the elites are against Trump.
[02:18:33.528 --> 02:18:34.228]  What do you think you should do?
[02:18:35.282 --> 02:18:37.244]  Well look, he needs to call them out on it.
[02:18:37.465 --> 02:18:42.150]  And again, he needs to level with the public about the severity of this bubble.
[02:18:42.631 --> 02:18:45.455]  He can't be claiming credit for the stock market going up.
[02:18:45.715 --> 02:18:52.203]  He can't be touting these government phony unemployment numbers as if he's a successful president because the unemployment rate is down.
[02:18:52.443 --> 02:18:55.404]  The unemployment rate was falling the whole time Obama was president.
[02:18:55.464 --> 02:18:56.444]  It is meaningless!
[02:18:56.744 --> 02:19:08.348]  He needs to go back to what got him elected, and stop being a politician, and actually get to the root cause of the problem, and use the bully pulpit to get the public ready for what really needs to be done to clean up this mess.
[02:19:08.548 --> 02:19:09.868]  Let's start draining the swamp!
[02:19:11.529 --> 02:19:13.309]  You're right, we don't want him to become the swamp.
[02:19:14.169 --> 02:19:16.310]  So how would you grade Trump right now, Peter Schiff?
[02:19:17.537 --> 02:19:23.038]  Well, I'm not giving him a good grade because he's not doing what needs to be done.
[02:19:24.099 --> 02:19:29.400]  He's obviously got all kinds of criticism coming at him from all angles.
[02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:30.960]  The media is all over him.
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:35.461]  Obviously, if they were treating President Obama like this, they couldn't.
[02:19:35.501 --> 02:19:36.522]  It would all be racism.
[02:19:36.582 --> 02:19:37.102]  It's not fair.
[02:19:37.802 --> 02:19:41.703]  I mean, so he's not getting a fair shot, but he inherited a disaster.
[02:19:42.123 --> 02:19:47.304]  He's not doing what I want him to do to try to help, you know, make America great again.
[02:19:47.324 --> 02:19:49.564]  Let's talk about it when we come back, how we make America great again.
[02:19:50.104 --> 02:19:53.805]  All I know is TPP killed, you know, getting us out of the climate thing.
[02:19:53.865 --> 02:19:56.365]  I mean, he's done a lot of good stuff, securing the border.
[02:19:56.845 --> 02:19:57.626]  Stay there, Peter Schiff.
[02:19:57.646 --> 02:19:58.646]  We'll come back at your take on that.
[02:19:59.326 --> 02:20:02.046]  But you're right about some of the other economic stuff.
[02:20:03.587 --> 02:20:05.767]  Imagine the world without Infowars.
[02:20:09.212 --> 02:20:11.173]  The globalists have already consolidated their ballot.
[02:20:11.693 --> 02:20:15.395]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[02:20:16.095 --> 02:20:29.420]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[02:20:29.841 --> 02:20:35.003]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[02:20:35.763 --> 02:20:39.590]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate,
[02:20:40.885 --> 02:20:46.970]  News and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:50.073]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[02:20:50.993 --> 02:21:05.966]  And I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[02:21:06.366 --> 02:21:08.528]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[02:21:09.853 --> 02:21:21.521]  And it is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWareStore.com.
[02:21:23.022 --> 02:21:25.544]  On top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip,
[02:21:26.064 --> 02:21:31.646]  You get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[02:21:32.206 --> 02:21:34.848]  Emmerich's Essentials is all about personal care.
[02:21:35.288 --> 02:21:41.550]  Hygiene, not getting skin cancer, not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[02:21:42.030 --> 02:21:43.011]  It's all there.
[02:21:43.191 --> 02:21:48.053]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it.
[02:21:48.673 --> 02:21:49.814]  It's truly game-changing.
[02:21:50.274 --> 02:21:51.074]  BOA Spray.
[02:21:51.394 --> 02:21:53.415]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[02:21:54.115 --> 02:21:57.677]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[02:21:58.057 --> 02:22:00.338]  And it is comparable in price.
[02:22:00.638 --> 02:22:02.059]  And again, it's concentrated.
[02:22:02.399 --> 02:22:03.820]  The deodorant is amazing.
[02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:04.980]  High quality.
[02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:07.181]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[02:22:07.481 --> 02:22:08.201]  Totally natural.
[02:22:08.482 --> 02:22:09.002]  Works great.
[02:22:09.922 --> 02:22:12.763]  SPF 30 Face and Body Lotion Sunscreen.
[02:22:13.144 --> 02:22:13.664]  Unscented.
[02:22:14.224 --> 02:22:19.010]  This is exciting because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[02:22:19.331 --> 02:22:21.433]  Because everyone knows I'm obsessed with Win-Wins.
[02:22:21.453 --> 02:22:22.635]  20% off what it is retail.
[02:22:24.701 --> 02:22:33.510]  Because we cut out the middleman and then additionally you sign up for auto ship out of the gates 25% off that because I want you to try these products.
[02:22:33.650 --> 02:22:34.892]  I want you to love these products.
[02:22:35.232 --> 02:22:45.863]  I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win a non-zero-sum game where you get high quality you get value and you repeat order something you need every month.
[02:22:46.724 --> 02:22:54.353]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[02:22:54.633 --> 02:22:59.259]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[02:23:03.132 --> 02:23:10.235]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:23:10.596 --> 02:23:23.822]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:23:24.762 --> 02:23:35.986]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:23:36.646 --> 02:23:42.608]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[02:23:43.368 --> 02:23:51.756]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[02:23:52.377 --> 02:24:00.585]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:15.085]  Colonel Anthony Schaeffer, who is always amazing inside Intel, is joining us to break down the Democratic plan to basically bring in martial law.
[02:24:15.605 --> 02:24:16.686]  Sean Hannity's been covering it.
[02:24:16.706 --> 02:24:18.067]  The Democrats have been sub-raising.
[02:24:18.147 --> 02:24:20.669]  They've talked about it in major policy papers.
[02:24:21.410 --> 02:24:26.073]  They've got former Deputy Defense Secretaries making the rounds in the news, trying to sell the idea.
[02:24:26.213 --> 02:24:27.014]  It's just insane.
[02:24:27.034 --> 02:24:31.697]  Because they all know a big collapse is coming, and I guess they want to blame Trump and start some civil unrest.
[02:24:32.197 --> 02:24:33.338]  Soros is out there pushing it.
[02:24:33.959 --> 02:24:36.721]  The head of EuroPAC.com, Peter Schiff, is our guest.
[02:24:37.381 --> 02:24:39.922]  Ron Paul said, if I get elected president, I'm not a dictator.
[02:24:40.302 --> 02:24:42.342]  We've got to wean people off a big government.
[02:24:42.362 --> 02:24:43.182]  It's going to take a while.
[02:24:43.623 --> 02:24:45.863]  I'm not an apologist for Trump, and I'm not disagreeing with Schiff.
[02:24:45.883 --> 02:24:46.443]  I think he's right.
[02:24:47.343 --> 02:24:48.324]  But I'm a realist.
[02:24:49.064 --> 02:24:50.484]  And you see the elite against Trump.
[02:24:50.524 --> 02:24:52.145]  You see the powers that be trying to block him.
[02:24:52.625 --> 02:24:53.145]  What does he do?
[02:24:53.225 --> 02:24:55.005]  Come in and just let the economy totally implode?
[02:24:55.025 --> 02:24:57.666]  I mean, I understand at some point the bubble has to go down.
[02:24:58.426 --> 02:25:01.267]  But, I mean, Peter, Schiff, quantify what you're saying for us.
[02:25:02.418 --> 02:25:08.139]  Well, what I'm saying is that the air is going to come out of this bubble, just like it did on George Bush.
[02:25:08.159 --> 02:25:12.940]  Remember, the Fed inflated that phony recovery when it blew up the housing bubble.
[02:25:13.420 --> 02:25:18.262]  And that bubble, though, didn't survive the second term of Bush.
[02:25:18.362 --> 02:25:26.523]  It blew up while Bush was still president, and that's what helped Barack Obama become president, because people didn't want to vote for McCain.
[02:25:26.563 --> 02:25:28.784]  Did they purposely inflate it to get Obama elected?
[02:25:29.887 --> 02:25:38.200]  No, you know, I don't think that they are that smart that they can time it and orchestrate it the way, you know, they just got lucky that it happened, you know, before.
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:40.624]  Sure, because they're trying to stop Trump's stock market right now.
[02:25:40.644 --> 02:25:41.145]  It's not working.
[02:25:42.045 --> 02:25:43.626]  Well, they're raising interest rates.
[02:25:43.786 --> 02:25:45.406]  They're announcing quantitative easing.
[02:25:45.446 --> 02:25:45.906]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:25:45.946 --> 02:25:50.408]  I think they're doing things that you would think would make the stock market go down.
[02:25:50.528 --> 02:25:59.071]  I'm really not sure what's keeping it up to the extent that maybe the market doesn't believe the Fed, that they think that they're bluffing, that they're not going to carry out with this quantitative easing.
[02:25:59.091 --> 02:26:00.492]  I think people want to make America great again.
[02:26:00.512 --> 02:26:05.374]  I think they're betting on America and just saying, you know what, this is my only vote is money and I'm doubling down.
[02:26:06.274 --> 02:26:08.897]  Yeah, but the market is already extremely expensive.
[02:26:08.937 --> 02:26:12.901]  It's not like you have a cheap market and you can make a good value in America.
[02:26:12.921 --> 02:26:17.086]  Yeah, but I mean the overall market.
[02:26:17.106 --> 02:26:18.247]  Forget about just Amazon.
[02:26:18.448 --> 02:26:20.230]  Just look at the overall S&P 500.
[02:26:20.850 --> 02:26:24.014]  We haven't had valuations this high since the bubble in 1999-2000.
[02:26:25.996 --> 02:26:27.177]  And look how that ended.
[02:26:27.237 --> 02:26:29.359]  But the point is that the Fed did this.
[02:26:29.439 --> 02:26:31.340]  The market is a creation of the Fed.
[02:26:31.641 --> 02:26:33.402]  It's all about cheap money and liquidity.
[02:26:33.662 --> 02:26:36.445]  And if they withdraw that, then the market's going to come down.
[02:26:36.485 --> 02:26:37.666]  It's only a question of time.
[02:26:37.906 --> 02:26:39.207]  And it's going to come down hard.
[02:26:39.567 --> 02:26:40.968]  And who's going to get blamed for it?
[02:26:41.228 --> 02:26:46.453]  And since Trump has already said, look, the market is going up, that means I'm doing a good job.
[02:26:46.713 --> 02:26:48.134]  This is a barometer for my presidency.
[02:26:48.154 --> 02:26:48.935]  He's already shut himself up.
[02:26:49.355 --> 02:26:49.936]  That's a good point.
[02:27:09.916 --> 02:27:20.315]  You're exuberance, you made the market go up, and you believe, and I've already done all this to get jobs back, but globally they're trying to beat me, they're raising rates to hurt you, so if it goes down they get the blame.
[02:27:21.428 --> 02:27:26.930]  Yeah, they will get the blame, but ultimately rates have to go up anyway if we're ever going to have a real economy.
[02:27:27.191 --> 02:27:28.811]  The stock market has to come down.
[02:27:29.071 --> 02:27:30.692]  That's part of the recovery.
[02:27:30.992 --> 02:27:40.476]  So instead of saying, hey, the stock market going up shows I'm a good president, the stock market coming down means that he's doing things that will actually help the economy.
[02:27:40.676 --> 02:27:44.698]  We need asset prices to fall because we have to let interest rates rise.
[02:27:44.918 --> 02:27:46.319]  We have to default on debt.
[02:27:46.459 --> 02:27:48.500]  But it's like putting your shoulder back in the socket.
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:50.180]  We know we need to do it, but it's not going to feel good.
[02:27:50.481 --> 02:27:55.182]  And Peter, I think, you know, I agree with you and I have agreed with you for years.
[02:27:55.282 --> 02:28:02.685]  I mean, I was opposed to the quantitative easing and all the $20 trillion in debt and all the increases in federal spending.
[02:28:02.705 --> 02:28:06.547]  I just think that, you know, look, Trump is dealing with the food stamps.
[02:28:06.587 --> 02:28:08.207]  He's getting people off the food stamps.
[02:28:08.248 --> 02:28:10.608]  He's reducing the number of illegal immigrants in the country.
[02:28:11.049 --> 02:28:14.130]  He's going to have to deal with these programs, not overnight.
[02:28:14.650 --> 02:28:15.891]  Because you can't just cut them off.
[02:28:15.911 --> 02:28:16.732]  Yeah, let's admit that.
[02:28:16.772 --> 02:28:21.296]  He's already done a lot of good stuff when it comes to sovereignty, militarily.
[02:28:21.316 --> 02:28:24.119]  I mean, I think Trump, I mean, let's give him credit on that.
[02:28:24.139 --> 02:28:25.180]  I mean, I'm not being the cheerleader.
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:25.580]  No, he is.
[02:28:26.341 --> 02:28:39.754]  There are some good things that he has done on the margins, but you're talking about, we have a terminally ill patient here, and if you clear up some of his acne that he might have, I mean, sure, okay, so now he's going to be a nicer looking corpse, but we have more
[02:28:40.034 --> 02:28:40.735]  I think so.
[02:28:53.936 --> 02:28:59.939]  Well, look, they've already gone on a lot longer than I would have thought if we were having this conversation five years ago, ten years ago.
[02:28:59.999 --> 02:29:02.581]  So, look, we're living on borrowed money, literally.
[02:29:02.961 --> 02:29:03.621]  I don't know.
[02:29:03.761 --> 02:29:05.642]  I think we're getting closer and closer.
[02:29:05.963 --> 02:29:13.907]  And now that Trump is the fall guy, it seems like it makes a lot of sense for a lot of reasons that it's going to happen soon, over the next couple of years.
[02:29:13.927 --> 02:29:15.388]  So, again, people need to prepare.
[02:29:15.788 --> 02:29:16.989]  You know, get your gold.
[02:29:17.049 --> 02:29:18.090]  I mean, gold is still below $1,300, $1,260.
[02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:23.254]  I'm investing money for people outside the United States.
[02:29:23.474 --> 02:29:27.698]  The dollar is near a six-month low, but it's still near a 14-year high.
[02:29:27.718 --> 02:29:32.862]  You know, we've surrendered all of the Trump gains in the dollar, but it still has a long way to fall.
[02:29:33.082 --> 02:29:35.704]  That means Americans can still invest their dollars overseas.
[02:29:35.724 --> 02:29:39.728]  They can go into Singapore, New Zealand, Switzerland, Hong Kong, other markets.
[02:29:39.788 --> 02:29:40.808]  All right.
[02:29:41.009 --> 02:29:42.670]  Peter Schaffer of Pacific Capital, thank you.
[02:29:42.690 --> 02:29:43.751]  We'll be back with Colonel Schaffer.
[02:29:44.011 --> 02:29:44.912]  Thank you, Dr. Corsi.
[02:29:44.932 --> 02:29:46.033]  This is big news coming up.
[02:29:46.453 --> 02:29:47.474]  That was powerful info, though.
[02:29:47.494 --> 02:29:50.557]  They are trying to sabotage the Trump recovery, whether you agree with his policies or not.
[02:29:50.597 --> 02:29:51.518]  That's the big takeaway.
[02:29:52.499 --> 02:29:53.400]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.880 --> 02:29:55.481]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.422 --> 02:29:59.105]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:07.941 --> 02:30:09.302]  Welcome back to Brain Fight.
[02:30:09.462 --> 02:30:11.043]  I'm the real Tuck Buckford.
[02:30:11.523 --> 02:30:18.187]  And coming up this Thursday, I'm going to be in Alex Jones' face, showing the world what a traitor and an enemy he is.
[02:30:18.527 --> 02:30:21.549]  Let's look at another dried lizard penis.
[02:30:21.749 --> 02:30:22.989]  Why, that's Bill Clinton.
[02:30:23.209 --> 02:30:23.690]  Yogurt.
[02:30:24.510 --> 02:30:27.372]  Tuck Buckford don't like Alex Jones.
[02:30:27.572 --> 02:30:29.393]  I want to bring up my next guest.
[02:30:30.683 --> 02:30:38.949]  Donald John Trump, he's been on the show before and all of it's gonna be brought to you by CBS and that little angel Stephen Colbert.
[02:30:39.329 --> 02:30:45.373]  So join me this Thursday for the real brain fight there in the Alex Jones Show 11 a.m.
[02:30:45.413 --> 02:30:46.073]  to 2 p.m.
[02:30:46.133 --> 02:30:48.575]  Central at that traitorous evil website.
[02:30:48.935 --> 02:30:52.798]  None of you should visit Infowars.com.
[02:30:53.038 --> 02:30:55.220]  This is not violent at all, but I do this to Trump.
[02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:57.141]  Just do what CBS wants, that's good.
[02:30:57.581 --> 02:30:58.602]  I'm gonna do whatever my...
[02:31:01.797 --> 02:31:02.613]  Kobani Yoga.
[02:31:03.911 --> 02:31:08.794]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[02:31:09.595 --> 02:31:12.537]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.

[02:31:16.620 --> 02:31:21.503]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.

[02:33:38.246 --> 02:33:44.389]  Revolution is in the minds of the globalist minions promised riches and power like they were in Russia under communism.
[02:33:44.409 --> 02:33:50.131]  Cuba, China, or North Korea, or Venezuela, or all the other nightmares like the Congo.
[02:33:52.332 --> 02:33:57.034]  Or once wealthy Western European countries that fell to communism, an Eastern European.
[02:33:58.115 --> 02:34:01.756]  But now we fall to Islam, allied with the globalist scourge.
[02:34:03.097 --> 02:34:04.618]  Revolution is in their hearts.
[02:34:05.218 --> 02:34:07.219]  The hateful children of Satan begin to march.
[02:34:12.372 --> 02:34:13.973]  Alright, since we have Colonel Schafer on, let me know.
[02:34:14.713 --> 02:34:15.013]  Thanks.

[02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:25.882]  InfoWars Select storable foods.
[02:35:26.063 --> 02:35:28.907]  I named it Select, meaning quality, but it's not Select.
[02:35:29.268 --> 02:35:31.511]  It's the entire line of MyPatriot.
[02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:38.755]  They just only let me do 10% off every once in a while because they already have low prices, but by private labeling, I get around it in the contract.
[02:35:38.775 --> 02:35:41.197]  30 to 40% off, but I can only do it three times a year.
[02:35:41.217 --> 02:35:42.418]  This is one of those times.
[02:35:43.218 --> 02:35:50.124]  Emrix Essentials Outdoor Pack of Natural, Healthy, Non-Nano Zinc Oxide Sunscreen and Healthy Organic Bug Spray.
[02:35:50.484 --> 02:35:52.546]  Those two together, 40% off, unprecedented.
[02:35:52.906 --> 02:35:56.529]  Living Defense Parasite Cleanse, that's 20% off even though it's about to sell out.
[02:35:59.065 --> 02:36:04.849]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, and we are the model of the future.
[02:36:05.269 --> 02:36:14.456]  Independent media, funding itself with high quality products you sell, because they got rid of our Google advertising, $5 million a year, that it was set to be, it was $3.5 million last year.
[02:36:15.056 --> 02:36:18.258]  They hit a bunch of our sponsors, they death threat people, they just do it all.
[02:36:18.639 --> 02:36:21.641]  And I saw this years ago, I said, we're going to go to direct sales to folks.
[02:36:22.261 --> 02:36:24.463]  So now they try to hack attack the websites and shut us down.
[02:36:24.503 --> 02:36:25.443]  It's just, we're never going to give up.
[02:36:28.083 --> 02:36:32.727]  The news we're about to cover is some of the most powerful, important information I've ever covered.
[02:36:35.409 --> 02:36:40.514]  Elite publications like the Financial Times of London, the New Yorker magazine,
[02:36:43.163 --> 02:37:01.309]  Most importantly, Atlantic Monthly have all come out with articles, and I'm going to be showing you on screen while our guest is on, saying we need to overthrow President Trump, we need to have new elections and our homeland security, that's federalized things, and take all the Republicans that were elected in 2016 and remove them.
[02:37:01.329 --> 02:37:06.351]  Now remember, Obama's last action was to sign an executive order federalizing elections.
[02:37:06.491 --> 02:37:11.313]  All 50 attorney generals, including Democrats, wrote letters saying this violates the Federalist Clause.
[02:37:14.454 --> 02:37:17.814]  Trump is battling to try to remove all this bureaucracy, but it's still there.
[02:37:18.595 --> 02:37:28.457]  There's a mutiny going on, and the media has pointed out in the Washington Post that Colonel Schaeffer says the same things, I say the same things, Sean Hannity says the same things.
[02:37:28.797 --> 02:37:32.398]  Well, I know nobody talks to the President outside the White House like Sean Hannity.
[02:37:32.958 --> 02:37:34.238]  They talk every day, I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:37:34.638 --> 02:37:36.359]  But the President was already aware of this.
[02:37:37.287 --> 02:37:44.572]  He's shocked by how pliable the media is and the deep state to actually try to block a recovery and do this, but they intend it.
[02:37:45.272 --> 02:37:53.738]  So I wanted to play a clip briefly of Sean Hannity Tuesday talking about this, and then a month ago on Lou Dobbs' business, Colonel Schaefer breaking it down.
[02:37:53.998 --> 02:37:55.819]  But none of us are plagiarizing each other.
[02:37:55.879 --> 02:37:56.760]  We're all educated.
[02:37:57.020 --> 02:37:57.720]  We're all informed.
[02:37:57.740 --> 02:38:01.423]  We're reading what the Democrats are saying.
[02:38:03.118 --> 02:38:07.381]  And we're historically looking at it, they're calling for death, violence.
[02:38:08.042 --> 02:38:09.062]  This is insane.
[02:38:09.082 --> 02:38:23.313]  So I want to ask Colonel Schaeffer, former head of the Bin Laden unit, patriot, with a lot of big connections, helped expose Benghazi, you name it, works for the London Center for Foreign Policy Research, Fox contributor, where we are currently and how serious the situation is.
[02:38:23.353 --> 02:38:26.375]  But first, here's a clip of Sean Hannity Tuesday.
[02:38:26.395 --> 02:38:29.057]  They're calling for him to be fired right now at the Washington Post.
[02:38:30.057 --> 02:38:42.587]  Also tonight, a soft coup is underway right here in the United States of America in an attempt to overturn November's election results and forcibly remove a duly elected president from office.
[02:38:43.107 --> 02:38:49.172]  Sinister forces quickly aligning in what is becoming now, in my mind, a clear and present danger.
[02:38:49.192 --> 02:38:51.754]  That is tonight's very important opening monologue.
[02:38:52.074 --> 02:38:52.694]  Alright, boom.
[02:38:53.334 --> 02:39:02.256]  Then a 15 minute breakdown of them saying kill the president, the deep state, Schumer bragging, the intelligence community has seven ways to take you down.
[02:39:02.737 --> 02:39:12.959]  Then they come out in the Washington Post article and say Fox News' Sean Hannity is encroaching on Alex Jones' territory because he quotes the same statements they've made about the plan to overthrow him.
[02:39:13.559 --> 02:39:19.243]  So they want to get this plan going, but then they want to deny it, even though it's in the news, when we oppose it.
[02:39:19.784 --> 02:39:22.145]  That is what they call black propaganda.
[02:39:22.245 --> 02:39:25.508]  They are using serious, unprecedented disinfo.
[02:39:26.108 --> 02:39:28.650]  Colonel Schaefer, you're more of an expert on this than even I am.
[02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:35.995]  I know that you've worked in some of the most classified areas there are, and really had up a lot of things that I'll never see the light of day for this country.
[02:39:36.415 --> 02:39:38.437]  Am I overestimating how serious this is?
[02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:42.774]  No, Alex, thank you for having me on, and no, you're laying that completely correctly.
[02:39:43.014 --> 02:39:48.139]  You're essentially outlining the situation based on their own verbiage.
[02:39:48.499 --> 02:39:56.287]  And of course, then when they get caught in the open daylight, they then try to say, no, no, no, no, we never said that, it's all about you.
[02:39:56.847 --> 02:39:59.450]  The same way the deep state goes about saying the deep state doesn't exist.
[02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:05.974]  And as you pointed out, this is the first time you and I have spoken since what, I don't know how many months ago.
[02:40:06.534 --> 02:40:07.995]  Sean Hannity and I haven't spoken.
[02:40:08.396 --> 02:40:16.921]  This is all original work by all of us simply observing what we see and factually analyzing and putting it back out.
[02:40:17.501 --> 02:40:20.884]  And my analysis is just a bit different than yours and Sean's.
[02:40:20.944 --> 02:40:29.029]  Mine is coming from the perspective of how I've looked at and studied terror organizations and how they go about radicalizing individuals.
[02:40:29.649 --> 02:40:34.772]  My posit on this, Alex, and I've gotten some pushback and people don't like what I say, but the fact is this.
[02:40:35.312 --> 02:40:56.665]  The way that the left is going about trying to demonize the president, essentially justify and ignore the violence on their side, and then reinforce that with a complete, the imagery of death being acceptable, Kathy Griffith using the beheaded image of the president.
[02:40:57.325 --> 02:41:03.731]  All these things are the same way ISIS goes about radicalizing and recruiting people to become terrorists.
[02:41:04.291 --> 02:41:05.873]  And that is what I'm seeing.
[02:41:05.993 --> 02:41:14.200]  I'm seeing a direct correlation, a direct pathology that is the same between ISIS going about isolating individuals,
[02:41:14.820 --> 02:41:15.440]  We're good to go.
[02:41:35.565 --> 02:41:46.394]  What the left is pushing for here is a use of violence as a political extension of their methodology, of their ideology, and that's what we all have to be very concerned about.
[02:41:46.774 --> 02:42:00.726]  And yes, the republic is in danger by the fact that you have a group of individuals who are willing to subsume and overwhelm any legitimate element of government trying to protect the American people for purposes of trying to allow for this chaos to happen.
[02:42:01.786 --> 02:42:04.327]  Well, when you say you're getting pushback, it's because you're over the target.
[02:42:04.687 --> 02:42:10.930]  The Democrats are saying kill the president in every major newspaper I've seen has written op-eds.
[02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:14.131]  I see it in movies, I see it in plays, I see it in dramas.
[02:42:14.171 --> 02:42:26.136]  Kathy Griffin you mentioned, Snoop Dogg, Bow Wow says kidnap his wife, rape her, sex slave her, the Islamist's capitulation by the feminists, putting on hijabs.
[02:42:26.236 --> 02:42:27.077]  I mean, it is like...
[02:42:27.961 --> 02:42:29.242]  Mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:42:29.523 --> 02:42:31.665]  And then they're everywhere saying, we're going to get violent.
[02:42:32.206 --> 02:42:35.409]  I mean, just on Infowars.com, the commenters coming after us on the streets.
[02:42:35.950 --> 02:42:46.321]  It's just as you said, as ISIS or Al Qaeda puts out this message, kind of like fire ants put out pheromones and all sting you at once, they say, go, kill, it's acceptable, do it.
[02:42:46.641 --> 02:42:51.046]  You know, the guy that tried to kill Trump in Nevada, you know, grabbing the cop's gun.
[02:42:51.066 --> 02:42:53.268]  He's a hero, the BBC says.
[02:42:53.508 --> 02:42:58.974]  Wolf Blitzer has a guest on, you know, the day that Congressman Scalise and the cops and everybody get shot a few weeks ago.
[02:42:59.475 --> 02:43:01.677]  And he says, this man was not evil.
[02:43:01.737 --> 02:43:02.758]  He was tired of politics.
[02:43:02.798 --> 02:43:04.240]  And Wolf Blitzer nods his head.
[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:06.142]  I mean, if somebody goes and shoots Blitzer,
[02:43:06.542 --> 02:43:08.502]  And then we say, oh, it's just politics.
[02:43:08.562 --> 02:43:09.623]  I hope that doesn't happen.
[02:43:10.003 --> 02:43:18.244]  And the weirdest thing is, it's not soldiers or tough guys who've had an experience doing this, who then are always wanting to be restrained, as conservatives are.
[02:43:18.684 --> 02:43:23.225]  They're taking you and others' kindness and restraint as weakness.
[02:43:23.585 --> 02:43:32.727]  And I see, like, armies of beta males, communists with their fingers on their triggers, coming to Trump rallies and aiming guns at people, and the cops let them do it.
[02:43:33.007 --> 02:43:33.867]  I mean, I'm seeing a
[02:43:35.027 --> 02:43:40.168]  Like, death wish, crazed, suicide gene, just like we see in the Islamicists.
[02:43:40.488 --> 02:43:41.368]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:43:41.388 --> 02:43:43.268]  In fact, I hadn't really thought of it, but never said it.
[02:43:43.548 --> 02:43:46.529]  They are literally becoming Islamified.
[02:43:47.369 --> 02:43:47.569]  Right.
[02:43:48.129 --> 02:43:54.130]  And that's the danger, Alex, is that they have lost a connection with the democracy which we hold true.
[02:43:54.590 --> 02:43:57.011]  And you and I have spoken about this a dozen times.
[02:43:57.831 --> 02:43:58.571]  The fact is this.
[02:43:58.651 --> 02:44:03.872]  The government's job is to preserve and protect the American people and serve the common good.
[02:44:04.532 --> 02:44:27.243]  Alex, if the government doesn't get together, if Mr. Trump can't clear out the Obama folks, the pro-Trump, the pro-Clinton folks, you're going to see a complete breakdown of society, and inevitably, I think as you just stated, the left tends to take our kindness and consideration as weakness, and that is a dangerous mistake for them to make, because people are going to get upset,
[02:44:27.723 --> 02:44:43.474]  And as you saw in England last week, you saw a British, and I'm not saying we should go violent, I'm saying the inevitable result if the government does not provide for the common defense, common welfare, you're going to see individuals pick up and take justice into their own hands.
[02:44:43.494 --> 02:44:51.520]  And that's why you saw that British individual, that British citizen, no attack, the individuals from that mosque coming out, because he is fed up.
[02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:52.560]  I think so.
[02:45:12.572 --> 02:45:19.056]  Encouraging their side to rise up and be violent, and eventually people are going to become very perturbed by it.
[02:45:19.397 --> 02:45:25.560]  There's going to be good members of law enforcement who say enough's enough, and there's going to have to be a large effort to go after them.
[02:45:25.821 --> 02:45:41.671]  And dare I say, you're going to have to start locking people up for the very act of sedition I've seen come from the former, the department of the, Loretta Lynch, I think has been involved in sedition by her comments.
[02:45:42.671 --> 02:45:47.573]  You've seen other members of the former President Obama's staff encouraging violence.
[02:45:48.093 --> 02:45:49.773]  And I'm sorry, Alex, that's sedition.
[02:45:50.154 --> 02:45:59.816]  The moment you cross the line, you cannot accept legitimate outcomes of a political election, and then start fighting the government and the governance, then you become essentially an animated state.
[02:46:00.317 --> 02:46:03.057]  And in this case, they're actually encouraging acts of terror.
[02:46:03.378 --> 02:46:11.160]  And as you point out, the mainstream media was very accepting of congressmen, of police, of Scalise being attacked.
[02:46:11.700 --> 02:46:17.747]  Did you see the video of President Trump speaking to a crowd, and as soon as he sets up a moment of silence for police and the cops that got shot and others,
[02:46:27.398 --> 02:46:36.305]  They start booing and hissing and screaming, and I saw top Democratic strategists on Fox News defending hashtag Trump hunt Republicans.
[02:46:36.386 --> 02:46:39.308]  I mean, I mean, I don't want to have this be violent.
[02:46:39.328 --> 02:46:40.409]  We just won election wise.
[02:46:40.429 --> 02:46:42.010]  We just saw Karen Handel win.
[02:46:42.190 --> 02:46:43.792]  We've just won four upset.
[02:46:45.853 --> 02:46:51.836]  Special elections, despite the biggest democratic spending ever, we're winning the old-fashioned American way with ideas.
[02:46:51.976 --> 02:46:52.916]  I don't want a war.
[02:46:53.276 --> 02:46:56.518]  I don't need some, you know, coming-of-age deal to kill a bunch of liberals.
[02:46:56.858 --> 02:47:07.203]  I just can't, but I also feel like I'm in dereliction as a citizen of my duty not saying we have to start getting ready for insurrection and civil war because they're really pushing it.
[02:47:08.591 --> 02:47:09.572]  Literally, that's what they're pushing.
[02:47:09.632 --> 02:47:10.332]  I mean, exactly.
[02:47:10.812 --> 02:47:15.274]  And again, Alex, we cannot be dissuaded by them saying, oh, you're misinterpreting things.
[02:47:15.334 --> 02:47:15.514]  No.
[02:47:16.014 --> 02:47:22.076]  There's no way to misinterpret the idea that beheading a president and enslaving his family is somehow okay.
[02:47:22.356 --> 02:47:23.737]  Somehow that's just rhetoric.
[02:47:24.037 --> 02:47:29.659]  Because a certain percentage, Alex, as you know, of individuals on their side will take it seriously.
[02:47:29.999 --> 02:47:33.580]  They will begin to plan actions and they will- It's just like ISIS, what you said earlier.
[02:47:33.740 --> 02:47:35.681]  They put out the message to billions of people.
[02:47:35.981 --> 02:47:37.442]  They know people are going to act.
[02:47:37.482 --> 02:47:38.322]  It's like advertising.
[02:47:38.522 --> 02:47:42.264]  If you put advertising out to billions of people saying, come eat our hamburgers, they're going to come.
[02:47:42.464 --> 02:47:49.267]  Well, if you put out advertising to billions saying, kill, kill Republicans, kill Trump, kill Alex Jones, kill, kill, kill, it's going to happen.
[02:47:50.174 --> 02:47:52.795]  Right, and that's exactly what I'm saying.
[02:47:53.615 --> 02:47:56.636]  And even some on the left have admitted that there's issues.
[02:47:56.696 --> 02:48:00.657]  I've met with members of Congress on the Democrat side who recognize how dangerous this is.
[02:48:01.078 --> 02:48:05.559]  And look, I don't think Dennis Kucinich will mind me talking about a conversation he and I had recently.
[02:48:05.979 --> 02:48:08.620]  Dennis is a concerted liberal, not a progressive.
[02:48:08.660 --> 02:48:11.321]  A liberal has recognized, Alex, there's a difference.
[02:48:11.741 --> 02:48:19.465]  The liberals, the traditional liberals recognize that the idea of free speech, of free dialogue is important to the sustainment of any democracy.
[02:48:19.685 --> 02:48:28.329]  However, when you cross the line, when you start calling for violence and killing the other side, you're then going to destroy the very fabric of the ability to have those discussions.
[02:48:28.749 --> 02:48:31.651]  And that's where, that's where now we are literally in a danger zone.
[02:48:32.231 --> 02:48:32.552]  I saw it.
[02:48:32.592 --> 02:48:33.473]  Well, here's an example.
[02:48:33.493 --> 02:48:34.754]  I was in a restaurant.
[02:48:54.053 --> 02:49:15.764]  About a month and a half ago, we were going to the shooting range, I was sitting there with former military guys, you name it, and we all got concealed carry, and this guy follows us out, he shows us his gun, he says, you know, I ought to get you, and I didn't even know what to say to the guy, except I started getting ready, it was like an old western, I started getting ready, and then all of a sudden he figured it out and went back in the restaurant, but I just don't know what their prob- I mean, I've not done anything to these people.
[02:49:16.084 --> 02:49:21.411]  All I want is a secure, prosperous nation with tax cuts and take care of our veterans and secure our borders.
[02:49:21.491 --> 02:49:30.081]  I mean, I don't get why they hate America so much that they are willing to, like, literally attack President Trump's daughter on airplanes.
[02:49:30.121 --> 02:49:30.562]  You name it.
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:31.720]  Yeah.
[02:49:31.780 --> 02:49:32.921]  Alex, it's because of the culture.
[02:49:32.961 --> 02:49:36.582]  I mean, this is something I actually said on Lou Dobbs a few nights ago, and I got some pushback.
[02:49:36.642 --> 02:49:56.689]  Look, the millennial generation, with a few exceptions, has been completely brainwashed into believing that somehow America is the fault of all evil, that everything we've done has resulted in bad things happening, and they have become the believers in this very, very incorrect, but very corrosive idea.
[02:49:58.009 --> 02:49:59.350]  Yes, it's a cancer.
[02:49:59.811 --> 02:50:01.272]  And they are infected.
[02:50:01.292 --> 02:50:02.993]  Many are not willing to do it.
[02:50:03.633 --> 02:50:05.214]  My son is a conservative.
[02:50:05.254 --> 02:50:06.195]  He's a millennial.
[02:50:06.595 --> 02:50:11.438]  And he's constantly debating with his peers over what is factual.
[02:50:11.778 --> 02:50:15.661]  And they always answer his factual debate with emotion.
[02:50:18.002 --> 02:50:23.586]  Evergreen, you have a liberal professor, Burt Weinstein, who says you can't have a weekend where whites are banned.
[02:50:23.987 --> 02:50:28.530]  Then they file a complaint on him and the school tells him, 50 plus faculty filed it.
[02:50:28.770 --> 02:50:34.474]  They said you're not allowed to face your accuser and challenging allegations of racism is racism.
[02:50:34.694 --> 02:50:35.915]  It is Kafkaesque 1984.
[02:50:38.499 --> 02:50:38.659]  Right.
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:42.401]  And this is where we have to, again, clarify our message.
[02:50:42.862 --> 02:50:44.303]  Clarify what you just said, Alex.
[02:50:44.363 --> 02:50:46.884]  We want prosperity for all.
[02:50:47.144 --> 02:50:47.825]  All Americans.
[02:50:47.885 --> 02:50:49.065]  Not just conservatives.
[02:50:49.105 --> 02:50:50.686]  Not just our side.
[02:50:50.806 --> 02:50:51.287]  Everyone.
[02:50:51.607 --> 02:50:55.409]  And the idea here is to live by the rule of law and support the Constitution.
[02:50:55.669 --> 02:50:59.692]  And somehow, that has all become a radical idea to those on the left.
[02:50:59.752 --> 02:51:03.014]  And again, the progressives on the left, primarily.
[02:51:03.074 --> 02:51:06.316]  I think the liberals on the left, the traditional liberals, understand what's going on.
[02:51:06.736 --> 02:51:07.856]  Steve Bannon is an old-fashioned Democrat.
[02:51:28.322 --> 02:51:29.883]  Let's be clear, let me ask you this question again.
[02:51:29.903 --> 02:51:33.346]  Former Intel guy, running black ops against Al Qaeda, you name it.
[02:51:34.187 --> 02:51:35.268]  Able to age the whole nine yards.
[02:51:35.328 --> 02:51:36.008]  Colonel Schaefer.
[02:51:36.589 --> 02:51:38.270]  Tony-schaefer.com.
[02:51:38.310 --> 02:51:39.191]  Londoncenter.org.
[02:51:39.231 --> 02:51:39.732]  Read his books.
[02:51:40.052 --> 02:51:40.672]  Amazing guy.
[02:51:40.732 --> 02:51:41.753]  It's so hard to get him on.
[02:51:43.075 --> 02:51:50.217]  Looking at this, they were doing their incremental socialist takeover, and where all these leftists feel like they're part of the power structure, even though they're useful idiots and aren't.
[02:51:50.597 --> 02:51:54.878]  They see conservatism, libertarianism, free market renaissance awakening globally.
[02:51:55.218 --> 02:51:56.078]  They get scared.
[02:51:56.098 --> 02:51:58.099]  They're big billionaire funders like Soros realize it.
[02:51:58.399 --> 02:51:59.359]  He triples the funding.
[02:51:59.839 --> 02:52:03.900]  They come out of their beehives like it's the end of the world for them.
[02:52:05.100 --> 02:52:11.682]  And that's why they're launching their next 10-year operation in just a year, not out of strength, but out of desperation.
[02:52:12.358 --> 02:52:13.218]  Right.
[02:52:13.258 --> 02:52:16.360]  And to your point, this is where Antifa is getting its money.
[02:52:16.460 --> 02:52:22.642]  These kids who are Antifa, think about this Alex, they are all baristas at Starbucks for the most part.
[02:52:22.862 --> 02:52:26.984]  They don't have the money to take off and go away from work and go protest.
[02:52:27.664 --> 02:52:32.026]  You now have a professional protest class that's been created by Soros funding.
[02:52:32.607 --> 02:52:33.729]  And again, this is sedition.
[02:52:34.049 --> 02:52:34.831]  This is sedition.
[02:52:34.951 --> 02:52:38.839]  This is pushing us towards a communist society.
[02:52:38.899 --> 02:52:41.004]  So why is Soros still walking around?
[02:52:41.084 --> 02:52:41.885]  Why is he not arrested?
[02:52:43.686 --> 02:52:46.630]  Well, there's a number of people I think need to be in front of grand juries.
[02:52:46.650 --> 02:52:49.894]  Hillary Clinton, James Comey, and Soros.
[02:52:49.994 --> 02:52:59.165]  I think we've got to figure out how to push the legitimate elements of our government to become constitutionally appropriate and focused again.
[02:52:59.185 --> 02:53:03.290]  And I think that requires Mr. Trump to fire more people at the Justice Department.
[02:53:04.030 --> 02:53:14.333]  I agree, and I think Trump should bring people in like you that are bulldogs, and I mean, this is war!
[02:53:14.473 --> 02:53:17.053]  Here's the deal, I don't need to feel big going after them.
[02:53:17.313 --> 02:53:19.214]  I don't want to have some big roundup of liberals.
[02:53:19.294 --> 02:53:19.934]  I don't want to do that.
[02:53:20.254 --> 02:53:25.775]  They're the ones trying to push us into a communist, fascist, crazy, kill-everybody amalgamation.
[02:53:26.155 --> 02:53:28.016]  I'm being forced to really think about
[02:53:28.516 --> 02:53:31.381]  How we respond to them, because clearly they're getting ready to launch their attacks.
[02:53:31.701 --> 02:53:39.153]  Soros has spent a billion dollars just on the stuff coming up in July, and they literally are saying kill cops.
[02:53:39.274 --> 02:53:42.258]  I mean, I can't believe that law enforcement even puts up with this.
[02:53:43.209 --> 02:53:44.450]  No, I've talked to law enforcement.
[02:53:44.470 --> 02:53:50.292]  As a matter of fact, I work with several folks in law enforcement here in Virginia, and the answer is this.
[02:53:50.352 --> 02:53:53.794]  Law enforcement does feel very much targeted.
[02:53:54.014 --> 02:53:55.215]  All members, black and white.
[02:53:55.255 --> 02:53:56.896]  This is not a racial thing.
[02:53:57.276 --> 02:54:08.661]  I've talked to black members of the Philadelphia Police Force, undercover units, and told me flat out, Black Lives Matter is a fascist organization designed to undermine all law and order, no matter if it's black or white.
[02:54:08.721 --> 02:54:09.882]  So I think this is the thing.
[02:54:09.922 --> 02:54:12.083]  We have to continue to paint them, Alex, for what they are.
[02:54:12.563 --> 02:54:13.764]  They are fascists.
[02:54:13.784 --> 02:54:16.465]  They're seeking some level of control of our government.
[02:54:16.986 --> 02:54:19.287]  And if they can't control it, they want it disrupted or destroyed.
[02:54:19.747 --> 02:54:24.190]  And this is where we have to be very clear in trying to make it very clear to them.
[02:54:24.250 --> 02:54:25.530]  It's like, this is not acceptable.
[02:54:25.890 --> 02:54:30.433]  And then, again, I hope Mr. Trump and the government can get its act together to go after the leadership.
[02:54:30.453 --> 02:54:35.616]  Because, again, like I said, Antifa cannot exist without a level of funding from an outside source.
[02:54:35.656 --> 02:54:37.317]  That outside source we know is Soros.
[02:54:37.877 --> 02:54:38.918]  I've seen the intel on this.
[02:54:39.359 --> 02:54:45.185]  These groups are trying to organize all across the nation, and they're going to lead with violence, and that is simply not acceptable.
[02:54:45.666 --> 02:54:49.350]  Bottom line, you saw Loretta Lynch saying violence is necessary.
[02:54:49.370 --> 02:54:49.830]  You mentioned that.
[02:54:49.850 --> 02:54:50.591]  She said that a year ago.
[02:54:50.611 --> 02:54:53.855]  She had strong cities that said the UN should run our police departments.
[02:54:54.055 --> 02:54:54.816]  That was mainstream news.
[02:54:54.856 --> 02:54:55.657]  You can't make this up.
[02:54:55.917 --> 02:54:56.298]  It's clear.
[02:54:56.758 --> 02:55:01.740]  They think we're so dumb that if they kill a bunch of cops and kill conservatives and libertarians, we're going to roll over.
[02:55:02.180 --> 02:55:03.441]  They are so stupid.
[02:55:03.541 --> 02:55:04.101]  I don't know.
[02:55:04.121 --> 02:55:06.542]  They think bringing in Islam is their muscle?
[02:55:06.942 --> 02:55:09.744]  I mean, it's almost like someone's setting them up.
[02:55:09.864 --> 02:55:16.446]  I know they're not, but Soros needs to know this isn't the Middle East or some place that's historically divided like Ukraine.
[02:55:17.047 --> 02:55:22.069]  I'm not trying to be overconfident here because I'm worried about the aftermath here, but I don't see this going well for them.
[02:55:22.779 --> 02:55:26.026]  Let me say this, it's going to upset some folks in your audience.
[02:55:26.608 --> 02:55:29.534]  Alex, why do you think they are so open to radical Islam?
[02:55:30.234 --> 02:55:32.536]  The reason is because they like that system.
[02:55:32.896 --> 02:55:35.678]  They like the system of control radical Islam brings.
[02:55:36.019 --> 02:55:45.386]  So when you see those on the left apparently by all, you know, acting irrationally, ignoring the threat, the reason they're ignoring it, Alex, is because they like the model.
[02:55:45.746 --> 02:55:51.831]  They like the way Islam and radical Islam goes about subjugating individuals and putting power in their hands.
[02:55:51.851 --> 02:55:52.271]  They're bullies!
[02:55:52.291 --> 02:55:53.472]  That's why they like Sharia.
[02:55:53.732 --> 02:55:57.195]  That's what they're aiming for, and that's why you see them allowing it to happen.
[02:55:57.515 --> 02:55:58.776]  Birds of a feather fly together.
[02:55:58.896 --> 02:55:59.416]  They're bullies.
[02:55:59.476 --> 02:56:03.559]  So, President Trump listens to you, obviously, on Fox.
[02:56:03.619 --> 02:56:04.580]  He listens to us some.
[02:56:04.960 --> 02:56:06.601]  What is your message to President Trump?
[02:56:06.621 --> 02:56:08.743]  What other key points should we relay to folks?
[02:56:08.763 --> 02:56:10.844]  Because I want the listeners to know, this isn't hype.
[02:56:10.904 --> 02:56:13.426]  I mean, this country is in a major crisis.
[02:56:13.586 --> 02:56:16.748]  They know the American system will outperform collectivism.
[02:56:16.768 --> 02:56:18.369]  That's why they want to kill the American system.
[02:56:18.629 --> 02:56:20.570]  We were inches away from societal collapse.
[02:56:20.971 --> 02:56:23.292]  Trump and the American people came in during the breach.
[02:56:23.592 --> 02:56:25.073]  But we've only got a beachhead right now.
[02:56:25.113 --> 02:56:26.114]  I liken it to D-Day.
[02:56:26.314 --> 02:56:27.135]  We're only on the beach.
[02:56:28.236 --> 02:56:28.776]  Well, that's it.
[02:56:29.116 --> 02:56:30.698]  You need to get off the shore.
[02:56:30.838 --> 02:56:32.419]  Get off the shore, we die on the shore.
[02:56:32.479 --> 02:56:33.580]  It's like they said during D-Day.
[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:36.062]  You gotta get, you know, back into the hedgerows.
[02:56:36.082 --> 02:56:41.306]  You gotta carry on the fight to those who are attempting to undermine the successful effort.
[02:56:41.686 --> 02:56:43.667]  And the two things your audience needs to take away.
[02:56:43.727 --> 02:56:46.309]  First off, look, I think Mr. Trump is on the right track.
[02:56:46.950 --> 02:56:48.751]  I think he's made a lot of good progress.
[02:56:48.791 --> 02:56:49.992]  He will continue to make progress.
[02:56:50.012 --> 02:56:50.573]  But secondly,
[02:56:51.073 --> 02:56:54.135]  I would encourage him to be bolder than he is.
[02:56:54.816 --> 02:56:57.857]  You're not going to solve the problem by being nice, Alex.
[02:56:57.877 --> 02:57:03.941]  You know, as much as I think President Trump tried to be somewhat hands across the water by not prosecuting Ms.
[02:57:03.981 --> 02:57:05.803]  Clinton, I think he needs to rethink that.
[02:57:06.083 --> 02:57:17.010]  I think he needs to go after them, and to quote a good friend of mine, if you've got your boot on their throat, if you don't stop them, they're going to come back and they're going to burn your house down, and frankly, as we've seen, blood has been
[02:57:19.111 --> 02:57:19.952]  It's been flowing.
[02:57:19.972 --> 02:57:22.413]  A congressman was nearly assassinated.
[02:57:23.513 --> 02:57:25.514]  The left continues to push for violence.
[02:57:25.954 --> 02:57:36.099]  That, Alex, is not acceptable in anybody's book that I know is a rational human being who loves this country, and therefore anybody, to include liberals who recognize the danger to the progressives.
[02:57:36.499 --> 02:57:38.120]  We all need to come together behind the scenes.
[02:57:38.180 --> 02:57:43.062]  It may be strange to that of fellows, but do everything we can to support the president from clearing out
[02:57:43.522 --> 02:57:49.046]  It's a very clear and present danger to the sustainment and enhancement of our republic as we know it.
[02:57:49.847 --> 02:57:54.950]  It's a total clear and present danger, and the intimidation, the insanity, it's a Pandora's box.
[02:57:55.010 --> 02:58:02.616]  Everybody's got to come together for prosperity, stability, and it's total insanity to go down this road any further.
[02:58:03.476 --> 02:58:06.379]  Tony, I really appreciate you coming on, LondonCenter.org.
[02:58:06.419 --> 02:58:06.679]  Thank you.
[02:58:06.699 --> 02:58:07.719]  Thank you for all the work you're doing.
[02:58:07.740 --> 02:58:09.581]  I appreciate being on, and I hope to come back soon.
[02:58:09.941 --> 02:58:10.561]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:58:10.601 --> 02:58:12.142]  Well, please come back anytime you want.
[02:58:12.162 --> 02:58:13.102]  I know you're a busy guy.
[02:58:13.122 --> 02:58:16.403]  You know, you're working all the time briefing Congress and other folks behind the scenes.
[02:58:16.764 --> 02:58:17.984]  You're really a superhero for America.
[02:58:18.004 --> 02:58:24.586]  I know you don't want the credit, but you're one of the guys out there that so many times I connect the dots as one of the key people making sure this country gets to the next level.
[02:58:24.606 --> 02:58:28.008]  So I know that everybody wants to thank you, and please come back on soon.
[02:58:28.048 --> 02:58:28.548]  Thank you, Colonel.
[02:58:29.228 --> 02:58:29.528]  Thank you.
[02:58:29.548 --> 02:58:30.269]  Just want to do my share.
[02:58:30.369 --> 02:58:30.669]  Thanks.
[02:58:30.749 --> 02:58:31.089]  You bet.
[02:58:31.590 --> 02:58:32.830]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:32.850 --> 02:58:35.772]  The country is on the edge of an explosive civil war.
[02:58:36.152 --> 02:58:37.493]  We're desperately trying to stop it.
[02:58:37.973 --> 02:58:40.735]  Your actions now, peacefully, are critical.
[02:58:40.975 --> 02:58:42.036]  Fourth hour straight ahead.
[02:58:42.056 --> 02:58:42.556]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.737 --> 02:58:45.498]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:47.138 --> 02:58:49.180]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:53.905 --> 02:58:58.310]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:58:58.390 --> 02:59:09.342]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:59:09.502 --> 02:59:14.424]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:59:14.545 --> 02:59:17.066]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:59:17.126 --> 02:59:18.607]  It helps detoxify.
[02:59:18.827 --> 02:59:21.668]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:59:21.708 --> 02:59:26.471]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:59:26.491 --> 02:59:32.734]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:59:32.774 --> 02:59:38.056]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:59:38.176 --> 02:59:38.837]  I'm taking it now.
[02:59:39.397 --> 02:59:42.278]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:06.281 --> 03:00:09.522]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:10.062 --> 03:00:23.486]  Hey, I want to give all the little commies who don't even know how to pull a trigger right, running around with their guns, who want some Civil War.
[03:00:23.506 --> 03:00:27.587]  Let me tell you something, I got a decent life, I love my family, I love the country, I love the world.
[03:00:28.027 --> 03:00:29.808]  I'm not looking to get in some fight with you, but...
[03:00:31.260 --> 03:00:36.404]  You've heard Colonel Schaeffer was involved in a lot of black ops, all over the Middle East, all over Asia, all over Africa.
[03:00:38.046 --> 03:00:40.367]  And you heard him say clear and present danger.
[03:00:40.447 --> 03:00:47.453]  That's the term that Dr. Pchenik came up with back in the 70s.
[03:00:48.774 --> 03:00:50.015]  Of course, they made a movie about it.
[03:00:51.857 --> 03:00:53.558]  That's the term I started using about two months ago.
[03:00:53.598 --> 03:00:54.519]  Now Hannity uses it.
[03:00:54.559 --> 03:00:55.119]  They all use it.
[03:00:55.500 --> 03:00:56.220]  Because that's what it is.
[03:01:01.397 --> 03:01:07.181]  It's like these Antifa, you see video where they like punch some big guy in the face, he breaks their jaw and they call the police.
[03:01:07.581 --> 03:01:09.482]  The cops go, we saw the footage, you hit him.
[03:01:09.502 --> 03:01:12.725]  And it's not some cop butt-kissing exercise.
[03:01:12.765 --> 03:01:22.591]  It's not like we haven't been pulled over by a jerk cop or run into some person who shouldn't have a badge on a power trip, but the cops are the lowest level of government, just like we are, the people.
[03:01:23.352 --> 03:01:24.973]  They're on top, we're on top.
[03:01:25.433 --> 03:01:27.655]  The lowest level is the highest level in America.
[03:01:28.295 --> 03:01:30.917]  It's like TSA, I used to totally go after them until I realized
[03:01:32.133 --> 03:01:37.896]  Congress sets them up, Congress hires them, Congress then gives them these directives and won't let them profile.
[03:01:39.097 --> 03:01:39.958]  I thought, I'm an idiot.
[03:01:41.459 --> 03:01:45.341]  And you know, as you live, you grow, you understand things.
[03:01:46.562 --> 03:01:53.926]  It's just, I know the patriots in this country are just completely involved in the information war.
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:01:57.744]  And they don't want a violent revolution.
[03:01:58.045 --> 03:02:00.229]  We already had one politically and kicked your ass.
[03:02:00.510 --> 03:02:05.760]  And we just had four special elections where the Democrats spent in one case
[03:02:08.046 --> 03:02:10.368]  What does it say, seven times the previous record?
[03:02:11.069 --> 03:02:13.330]  For that state, it was like ten times the other record in another state.
[03:02:13.931 --> 03:02:19.015]  I want to talk to Anthony Cumia, who's a good American patriot, an entrepreneur with his own radio TV network.
[03:02:19.415 --> 03:02:21.157]  Number one show on XM, kicked off that.
[03:02:21.177 --> 03:02:23.299]  Number one show on Trust Radio, kicked off that.
[03:02:23.719 --> 03:02:25.881]  He's a conservative libertarian that also has some fun.
[03:02:25.901 --> 03:02:27.802]  You know, it's an adult show sometimes.
[03:02:28.223 --> 03:02:29.244]  Funny stuff, good stuff.
[03:02:29.944 --> 03:02:30.984]  And he's here seeing all this.
[03:02:31.044 --> 03:02:32.905]  I love always listening to the show, and he's good enough to be with us.
[03:02:33.245 --> 03:02:38.427]  I'm about to go 18 hours a day live, so if he wants to simulcast this great Compound Media, he's welcome.
[03:02:38.707 --> 03:02:41.608]  I'm not in competition with Compound Media or anybody.
[03:02:41.748 --> 03:02:42.488]  I want more.
[03:02:42.548 --> 03:02:44.008]  I love Sean Hannity getting hardcore.
[03:02:44.349 --> 03:02:45.829]  That means I can sleep a little bit better at night.
[03:02:45.869 --> 03:02:48.010]  Gavin McGinnis, all of it, over there at Compound Media.
[03:02:48.230 --> 03:02:51.331]  He's kind enough to let us, because they weren't done editing it until about 10 minutes ago.
[03:02:52.273 --> 03:02:53.633]  My plan was to air it earlier today.
[03:02:54.453 --> 03:02:56.074]  I play the part of Tuck Buckford.
[03:02:56.094 --> 03:02:59.074]  I mean, Colbert does it, but I did it without a writer.
[03:02:59.094 --> 03:03:02.335]  I just kind of did it off the cuff a few days ago, but they edited it together.
[03:03:02.575 --> 03:03:03.955]  Some of it's train wreck, some of it's good.
[03:03:04.355 --> 03:03:06.356]  He's kind of let us air 12 minutes up at the bottom of the hour.
[03:03:06.576 --> 03:03:07.756]  But I'm going to get out of here right now.
[03:03:08.096 --> 03:03:10.857]  Anthony Comey, what do you make of Karen Handel, the big win?
[03:03:11.717 --> 03:03:16.098]  The Democrats cheering Scalia being shot, or Scalise.
[03:03:17.162 --> 03:03:18.463]  I guess both big shot are killed.
[03:03:18.743 --> 03:03:23.667]  I mean, this is crazy how they boo when Trump says a moment of silence for those that were shot.
[03:03:23.747 --> 03:03:24.948]  These are true scum.
[03:03:25.289 --> 03:03:26.189]  What has happened to them?
[03:03:27.991 --> 03:03:32.535]  I was tweeting, of course, as I usually do about the recent election.
[03:03:34.779 --> 03:03:37.080]  And having Handel win.
[03:03:38.380 --> 03:03:40.821]  And they just still can't understand.
[03:03:41.161 --> 03:03:52.406]  They are handing these elections over to Republicans and they don't seem to understand that a large portion of this country does not agree with them.
[03:03:52.806 --> 03:04:03.070]  They can't imagine there are so many people in the United States of America that don't completely agree with them and are horrible racists, sexists,
[03:04:03.810 --> 03:04:07.131]  Homophobic, misogynistic people just running around all over the place.
[03:04:07.311 --> 03:04:10.212]  They thought it was a few people, but everyone thought like them.
[03:04:10.432 --> 03:04:26.977]  And now they're realizing the more of these left-wing shenanigans that they pull on a daily basis, an hourly basis, just drives Americans to the other side and takes
[03:04:28.081 --> 03:04:35.286]  Uh, their platform, and makes it look that much more irrelevant, out of touch, uh, elitist, and ridiculous.
[03:04:35.346 --> 03:04:35.726]  It's true.
[03:04:36.247 --> 03:04:38.008]  The Democratic Party is committing suicide.
[03:04:39.349 --> 03:04:40.230]  Yeah, thank God!
[03:04:40.650 --> 03:04:51.019]  I mean, after eight years of Obama, we're starting to emerge from this darkness that we've been in for so long.
[03:04:51.740 --> 03:04:54.162]  Anthony Cumia, Compound Media, straight ahead.
[03:04:54.262 --> 03:04:55.323]  This is the revolution.
[03:04:55.663 --> 03:04:56.604]  That's why they're attacking us.
[03:04:56.644 --> 03:04:58.726]  Spread the link, spread the show, spread the live feed.
[03:04:58.746 --> 03:05:00.007]  It's an act of resistance.
[03:05:05.160 --> 03:05:08.401]  He is the political cartoonist of this era.
[03:05:08.681 --> 03:05:09.181]  Hands down.
[03:05:09.201 --> 03:05:12.342]  There's some other great ones out there that we post on Infowars.com daily.
[03:05:12.462 --> 03:05:14.243]  He's got a new book that he self-published.
[03:05:14.263 --> 03:05:14.643]  It's amazing.
[03:05:14.663 --> 03:05:16.343]  It's like a coffee table book.
[03:05:16.383 --> 03:05:18.484]  The 2016 presidential election collection.
[03:05:18.644 --> 03:05:19.324]  It's good for adults.
[03:05:19.344 --> 03:05:20.004]  It's good for children.
[03:05:20.024 --> 03:05:20.624]  It's good for everybody.
[03:05:20.864 --> 03:05:22.245]  But this is how you wake somebody up.
[03:05:22.685 --> 03:05:24.986]  Usually people that are leftist or globalist minions.
[03:05:26.406 --> 03:05:28.768]  They won't watch a film, they won't even read a long book.
[03:05:28.928 --> 03:05:30.190]  This is the weapon.
[03:05:30.210 --> 03:05:32.311]  And when I saw this a few months ago, I said, get it.
[03:05:32.472 --> 03:05:32.852]  Carry it.
[03:05:32.932 --> 03:05:34.653]  Grrraffix.com.
[03:05:34.774 --> 03:05:35.634]  G-R-R.
[03:05:35.694 --> 03:05:36.195]  Graffix.com.
[03:05:36.315 --> 03:05:37.136]  And I'm not just saying this.
[03:05:37.176 --> 03:05:41.519]  He is the top cartoonist in the world, just from page views and Google searches.
[03:05:41.580 --> 03:05:47.485]  It's hands down, you were already probably in the top two or three, but in the Trump era, you are numero uno.
[03:05:47.565 --> 03:05:51.508]  And it all happened, it really turned around in 2016 because of the election.
[03:05:52.449 --> 03:05:56.432]  My wife and I sat down in late 2015 and decided, you know what?
[03:05:57.273 --> 03:05:58.634]  I'm going to draw more cartoons.
[03:05:58.674 --> 03:05:59.675]  This is too important.
[03:06:00.335 --> 03:06:02.837]  And we're going to go all out this year.
[03:06:03.138 --> 03:06:05.720]  And we saw our support snowball.
[03:06:05.740 --> 03:06:08.522]  I mean, when it comes to changing the world, bro, you're like The Voice.
[03:06:08.542 --> 03:06:09.703]  You're as big as InfoWars.
[03:06:09.943 --> 03:06:11.024]  You're as big as Drudge now.
[03:06:11.484 --> 03:06:13.366]  There's not much out there as big as this.
[03:06:13.606 --> 03:06:16.028]  You are now one of the main guns, brother.
[03:06:16.288 --> 03:06:18.170]  You are one of the main things defending this country.
[03:06:18.910 --> 03:06:20.831]  And there are plenty of room for more guns.
[03:06:20.971 --> 03:06:24.372]  I always encourage young cartoonists to join the fray.
[03:06:25.092 --> 03:06:29.794]  And a lot of them are afraid because they don't want to lose their job, they don't want to lose their, you know, they don't want to get trolled.
[03:06:30.754 --> 03:06:35.676]  And unfortunately, that's kind of the crucible that you're going to get hammered with when you start out.
[03:06:36.296 --> 03:06:37.176]  However, this is
[03:06:39.402 --> 03:06:44.568]  Well, what my cartoons are, Alex, I consider them visual alarm bells.
[03:06:44.668 --> 03:06:47.952]  Now, you get on your show, and you get angry, and you rant.
[03:06:48.893 --> 03:06:56.463]  My cartoons are a form of a visual rant, but they're visual alarm bells, and when that alarm bell goes off,
[03:06:57.196 --> 03:06:58.077]  And they get heard.
[03:06:58.557 --> 03:06:59.978]  It's going to make some people angry.
[03:07:00.078 --> 03:07:02.861]  Well, you turned that damn thing off and other people are happy.
[03:07:02.881 --> 03:07:04.522]  Well, you're doing a great service.
[03:07:04.542 --> 03:07:07.224]  So you're waking us up to what's going on.
[03:07:07.564 --> 03:07:13.529]  The left says there's no such thing as a conservative cartoonist because you're not funny and your status quo wrong.
[03:07:13.569 --> 03:07:18.132]  The status quo is now the liberal deep state, the globalist deep state, the collectivist deep state.
[03:07:18.212 --> 03:07:25.258]  And so all these things that used to be called conspiracy theories have now been revealed to be flat out conspiracies.
[03:07:25.578 --> 03:07:29.180]  And what Trump has done is really, he's beaten the snakes out of their holes.
[03:07:29.200 --> 03:07:31.621]  So now we see them for what they are.
[03:07:31.921 --> 03:07:35.623]  And that in and of itself is quite a good accomplishment.
[03:07:36.103 --> 03:07:42.467]  More people are waking up and, you know, your show and my cartoons, we're just trying to continue that momentum.
[03:07:43.528 --> 03:07:47.351]  People are realizing, you know, hey, we have something called the Constitution.
[03:07:48.052 --> 03:08:02.184]  We have to really wake up and not just go with our, like in my cartoon shows, these smiling lambs going brainwashed into the Great Maw, Great Maw of Globalism, and they're using Islam as a tool to expedite that.
[03:08:11.124 --> 03:08:11.645]  News.
[03:08:12.186 --> 03:08:13.007]  Analysis.
[03:08:13.508 --> 03:08:14.249]  Reports.
[03:08:14.950 --> 03:08:17.154]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[03:08:18.236 --> 03:08:21.561]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia!
[03:08:25.356 --> 03:08:26.097]  Thank you.
[03:08:26.737 --> 03:08:27.318]  Thank you.
[03:08:27.558 --> 03:08:29.839]  Anthony Comea in for Infowars.com.
[03:08:31.481 --> 03:08:34.623]  Man, a lot has transpired since I was last on.
[03:08:36.404 --> 03:08:45.691]  Once again, the violence and the violent tone of the left has an effect.
[03:08:46.171 --> 03:08:46.812]  Has an effect.
[03:08:47.597 --> 03:09:04.856]  I don't understand how they get away from what they did early on in the Trump campaign and the elections, saying that this right-wing, alt-right movement that was spreading such violence
[03:09:05.845 --> 03:09:13.331]  Amongst this country, their words, oh, they're inciting people to violence.
[03:09:13.771 --> 03:09:19.736]  Everybody, Trump supporters and the right, oh my goodness.
[03:09:19.916 --> 03:09:30.684]  If Trump doesn't win, my God, we're going to see riots in the streets from these horrible, right-wing, violent supporters of Donald Trump.
[03:09:31.685 --> 03:09:40.713]  So many magazine covers and mainstream media news coverage of them just predicting the future.
[03:09:41.494 --> 03:09:47.839]  That if Trump lost the election, we were going to see violence that we've never seen before.
[03:09:51.724 --> 03:10:04.093]  When Obama was elected twice, believe me, the right, the conservatives, Republicans, whatever you want to call everybody on that side, none too happy.
[03:10:04.914 --> 03:10:05.774]  None too happy.
[03:10:06.695 --> 03:10:10.958]  And they'd like you to think it was a racial thing, but it was his policies.
[03:10:11.038 --> 03:10:16.662]  No one in their right mind that is pro-American, pro-American worker,
[03:10:19.011 --> 03:10:22.353]  It was in support of President Obama.
[03:10:23.314 --> 03:10:24.595]  Were there riots in the streets?
[03:10:27.117 --> 03:10:28.438]  Was there violence?
[03:10:29.739 --> 03:10:41.567]  Truth of the matter is, in eight years of an African-American president in what is supposed to be one of the most racist nations in the world, the United States of America.
[03:10:42.047 --> 03:10:44.028]  I know, it's hard to even fathom.
[03:10:45.890 --> 03:10:47.391]  No one ever took a pot shot at him!
[03:10:50.113 --> 03:10:56.995]  There was a nut that ran into the White House, but I don't think his goal was to do the President any harm.
[03:10:58.476 --> 03:11:10.479]  Truth of the matter is, no one perpetrated any violence, or even attempted violence, on the first African American President of the United States.
[03:11:11.983 --> 03:11:19.568]  That's that violent, right-wing, maniacal group of people.
[03:11:20.769 --> 03:11:21.510]  NRA!
[03:11:21.550 --> 03:11:22.450]  They have guns!
[03:11:22.530 --> 03:11:23.051]  Look out!
[03:11:23.111 --> 03:11:23.791]  It's crazy!
[03:11:26.073 --> 03:11:33.578]  Not one person attempted to assassinate President Obama.
[03:11:36.120 --> 03:11:39.102]  Now we see what happens after Donald Trump wins.
[03:11:40.202 --> 03:11:53.549]  Boy, we certainly did see an increase in violence, violent rhetoric, rioting, destruction of property, assaults, lawlessness, arson.
[03:11:55.610 --> 03:12:00.732]  This came from the tolerant, progressive left.
[03:12:02.153 --> 03:12:08.276]  The ones that were so worried that the right was going to lose their minds
[03:12:09.552 --> 03:12:11.374]  And burn the country down.
[03:12:12.294 --> 03:12:18.879]  The tolerant left have taken to assassination.
[03:12:19.920 --> 03:12:20.801]  Assassinations.
[03:12:21.781 --> 03:12:27.486]  As we saw a couple weeks ago in the ballpark over there in Alexandria.
[03:12:28.947 --> 03:12:35.472]  Trying to kill as many Republican congressmen as possible.
[03:12:38.052 --> 03:12:39.533]  That's the tolerant left.
[03:12:40.033 --> 03:12:41.514]  Yet they continue.
[03:12:41.855 --> 03:12:44.957]  You watch that lying mainstream media.
[03:12:45.537 --> 03:12:49.960]  They will continue to tell you that this is Trump's fault.
[03:12:50.820 --> 03:13:02.488]  This is the alt-right getting people so riled up that they feel compelled now to take up arms and commit violence.
[03:13:05.040 --> 03:13:15.406]  And if you do not believe that the completely left-wing mainstream media is culpable in this, you're out of your mind.
[03:13:16.347 --> 03:13:19.109]  This is one of the most obvious things we've seen.
[03:13:19.609 --> 03:13:22.831]  There have been calls to violence.
[03:13:23.988 --> 03:13:25.749]  Put out on mainstream media.
[03:13:26.589 --> 03:13:27.349]  This isn't hidden.
[03:13:27.930 --> 03:13:40.454]  This isn't some secret plan that we don't know about that has to be investigated and looked into and the layers of the onion have to be peeled away to see what's happening.
[03:13:40.734 --> 03:13:46.897]  Where is this violent rhetoric coming from that is inciting people to commit violence and murder?
[03:13:47.077 --> 03:13:47.237]  Oh.
[03:13:50.282 --> 03:13:51.002]  Oh, it's the news.
[03:13:52.603 --> 03:13:55.684]  It's what people consider the news.
[03:13:56.604 --> 03:13:59.705]  This is insane to me.
[03:14:00.065 --> 03:14:02.686]  How blatantly obvious does it have to get?
[03:14:03.626 --> 03:14:17.590]  How right in your face does this have to get before even the most mentally incapable human beings in this country go, yeah,
[03:14:18.576 --> 03:14:27.102]  Yes, I absolutely see that mainstream media is attempting to twist minds for their own agenda.
[03:14:27.862 --> 03:14:34.607]  And that does include calling for murder of people on the right.
[03:14:36.648 --> 03:14:45.814]  They also blatantly call for the elimination of people through slander, libel, smear campaigns.
[03:14:46.334 --> 03:14:46.935]  We've seen it.
[03:14:47.912 --> 03:14:48.492]  We've seen it.
[03:14:48.792 --> 03:15:03.336]  If you are a viewer or listener to InfoWars, you know that Megyn Kelly and her hack job that she did on Alex Jones was exposed by Alex.
[03:15:04.376 --> 03:15:08.697]  I mean, thank God Alex has been through enough to know
[03:15:09.986 --> 03:15:11.267]  Not to trust these people.
[03:15:11.747 --> 03:15:15.490]  The sweet talk you get, and I've been through it over the years.
[03:15:15.770 --> 03:15:19.633]  I understand myself and Opie when I was with the Opie and Anthony Show.
[03:15:20.013 --> 03:15:26.758]  We got called by Bill O'Reilly to do a piece on the American youth.
[03:15:27.719 --> 03:15:30.522]  Like alright, we could do a story on that.
[03:15:31.083 --> 03:15:34.727]  And we get called in and again, we heard the same stuff Alex heard from Megan.
[03:15:35.007 --> 03:15:36.208]  It's not a hit piece.
[03:15:36.309 --> 03:15:37.250]  It's gonna be great.
[03:15:37.650 --> 03:15:38.631]  It's gonna be fun.
[03:15:38.671 --> 03:15:40.273]  They always say it's gonna be fun.
[03:15:40.934 --> 03:15:43.336]  These are con artists.
[03:15:44.037 --> 03:15:45.318]  They have an agenda.
[03:15:46.531 --> 03:15:50.435]  Uh, and they will always adhere to it, no matter what they tell you.
[03:15:50.816 --> 03:15:51.877]  Oh, it's not going to be a hit piece.
[03:15:51.897 --> 03:15:52.657]  It's going to be great.
[03:15:52.818 --> 03:15:54.379]  It's going to be so good for you.
[03:15:55.180 --> 03:16:01.947]  And then you get there, you sit in the seat, you're on their turf, you're on their home field, as it is.
[03:16:01.967 --> 03:16:08.093]  Uh, they are completely in charge of what the people finally see through editing.
[03:16:09.730 --> 03:16:10.890]  And they slam you.
[03:16:11.491 --> 03:16:18.012]  They slam you with questions that are a smear campaign.
[03:16:18.513 --> 03:16:19.993]  So we were able to see that.
[03:16:20.473 --> 03:16:26.495]  Thank God, like I said, Alex is smart enough to know to record these things as they're happening.
[03:16:27.555 --> 03:16:35.139]  And not be made to look like a fool once they get done with their edit hack job and put it up there.
[03:16:35.339 --> 03:16:37.080]  But that's the media!
[03:16:37.941 --> 03:16:40.222]  Don't for a second believe this is news!
[03:16:40.742 --> 03:16:42.623]  You know what I found out very recently?
[03:16:42.643 --> 03:16:51.328]  I assumed CNN, over the course of the years, got more and more dishonest.
[03:16:52.368 --> 03:17:09.462]  With the American people and and began to just lie Slowly over the course of the years to the point where it is now where they just don't care But we were so naive back in the late 80s and early 90s when CNN really took off it was during the first Gulf War and
[03:17:10.735 --> 03:17:13.296]  And I never knew this until very recently.
[03:17:13.616 --> 03:17:15.037]  That was all a sham.
[03:17:15.897 --> 03:17:18.338]  That was all dishonest reporting.
[03:17:18.598 --> 03:17:29.382]  When they had all those reporters over in Saudi Arabia, we saw them in Bahrain and Riyadh and Tel Aviv over in Israel.
[03:17:29.962 --> 03:17:33.263]  And I just found out recently, it was a set.
[03:17:34.323 --> 03:17:35.524]  They were on a set.
[03:17:36.929 --> 03:17:41.730]  Looking at the sky going, oh, I think there's some scud missiles coming in.
[03:17:42.230 --> 03:17:43.050]  Quick, gas!
[03:17:43.350 --> 03:17:44.330]  Put the gas mask on!
[03:17:44.711 --> 03:17:47.871]  And watching this in the early 90s was so compelling.
[03:17:48.471 --> 03:17:49.412]  It was addictive.
[03:17:49.972 --> 03:17:51.852]  Yeah, these are some of the clips.
[03:17:52.132 --> 03:17:52.912]  They're on a set.
[03:17:53.152 --> 03:17:57.853]  That's a fan blowing on that palm tree.
[03:17:58.113 --> 03:18:01.334]  They set up a fan to make it look like they were outside.
[03:18:02.882 --> 03:18:12.251]  And I was shocked at this because I didn't think this dishonesty by what we actually thought was the news was a scam.
[03:18:12.552 --> 03:18:13.913]  And that, look at this, a set.
[03:18:14.253 --> 03:18:18.878]  And that they were always dishonest and always agenda-driven.
[03:18:20.470 --> 03:18:22.631]  Uh, they weren't, they weren't where they said they were.
[03:18:22.772 --> 03:18:26.714]  They weren't in danger of a, a Scud missile, or a gas attack.
[03:18:27.314 --> 03:18:28.075]  We're on a set!
[03:18:28.775 --> 03:18:34.619]  And we bought it up, and the second the American people looked at that, and trusted it,
[03:18:35.499 --> 03:18:44.805]  As much as we trusted our nightly news with Walter Cronkite, I remember the tech offensive.
[03:18:44.905 --> 03:18:54.392]  The second we believed it, and the second they realized we were watching, they started just BSing us on a daily basis.
[03:18:55.012 --> 03:18:57.194]  And they've only stepped it up.
[03:18:58.314 --> 03:19:07.138]  Over the course of the years to the point they are at now where it's news entertainment, it's entertainment programming based on the news.
[03:19:07.678 --> 03:19:12.520]  It's like a parody show that is making money hand over fist through sponsors.
[03:19:13.121 --> 03:19:19.843]  And as we all know, the only way to get sponsors on board is to approach them and say, look how many people watch our show.
[03:19:21.304 --> 03:19:25.526]  And if all the news stations are doing the same news, you have to step it up, don't you?
[03:19:26.066 --> 03:19:27.167]  By lying.
[03:19:28.137 --> 03:19:37.820]  By being blatantly dishonest, and by putting people on sets and telling the American people it's news, when in fact it is 100% complete lies.
[03:19:39.760 --> 03:19:40.941]  Don't be fooled, people.
[03:19:41.241 --> 03:19:42.601]  You're not getting news there.
[03:19:43.041 --> 03:19:44.962]  You are not getting the news there.
[03:19:45.202 --> 03:19:47.403]  We'll be back in mere moments.
[03:19:47.743 --> 03:19:48.443]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:19:48.523 --> 03:19:53.284]  Anthony Cumia from Compound Media in for InfoWars.com.
[03:19:53.324 --> 03:19:54.825]  Be back in a second or two.
[03:20:03.174 --> 03:20:03.475]  It's been
[03:20:16.115 --> 03:20:18.876]  Again, I want to thank you all humbly for fighting the globalists.
[03:20:18.896 --> 03:20:20.376]  I want to thank you for your financial support.
[03:20:20.756 --> 03:20:25.817]  You're the reasons we're still here and growing in the face of an unprecedented onslaught.
[03:20:26.277 --> 03:20:29.978]  That's why this July 4th, we're having some of the biggest sales ever.

[03:20:59.517 --> 03:21:02.018]  Super Mel Vitality, sold out for months.

[03:21:12.865 --> 03:21:16.026]  Z Shield, our newest product, out of the gates.
[03:21:16.046 --> 03:21:18.288]  30% off because it's so amazing and I want you to try it.
[03:21:18.528 --> 03:21:20.489]  Emrix Essentials Outdoor Special.
[03:21:20.769 --> 03:21:27.353]  We're talking our non-nano zinc, incredibly concentrated, high-powered sunscreen, along
[03:21:27.933 --> 03:21:35.035]  With Emmerich's Essentials Bug Spray that's totally organic and natural and works way better than chemical brands I personally use.
[03:21:35.415 --> 03:21:41.997]  On that particular special, at 40% off, if you get the additional auto ship 10% off, we're talking about a lost leader.
[03:21:42.458 --> 03:21:50.200]  This July 4th, celebrating our republic, celebrating worldwide freedom, and celebrating returning America to its place in the world.
[03:21:50.660 --> 03:22:03.885]  As a true shining city on a hill where people want to come here to celebrate free market and an open society, not to celebrate a globalist, politically correct cesspool of infighting and mind control.
[03:22:08.386 --> 03:22:17.910]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[03:22:18.899 --> 03:22:20.780]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[03:22:21.541 --> 03:22:24.884]  Why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsTore.com?
[03:22:25.264 --> 03:22:27.706]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[03:22:27.986 --> 03:22:28.627]  And it's simple.
[03:22:29.227 --> 03:22:34.271]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[03:22:34.811 --> 03:22:35.792]  And there's a nexus point.
[03:22:35.872 --> 03:22:38.654]  There's quality versus price.
[03:22:38.714 --> 03:22:40.596]  And those two points have to come together.
[03:22:41.216 --> 03:22:46.621]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[03:22:47.461 --> 03:22:54.193]  ...has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[03:22:55.555 --> 03:22:57.757]  The true next generation in body armor.
[03:22:58.017 --> 03:23:08.425]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[03:23:09.065 --> 03:23:10.686]  It's nanotube technology.
[03:23:11.287 --> 03:23:12.808]  It's created here in Texas.
[03:23:13.448 --> 03:23:20.494]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[03:23:20.974 --> 03:23:32.776]  We used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[03:23:33.136 --> 03:23:38.137]  Born in Texas, made in America, exclusively available at M4WarStore.com right now.
[03:23:38.358 --> 03:23:40.458]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[03:23:41.378 --> 03:23:45.519]  And we shot everything you can imagine at it.
[03:23:46.815 --> 03:23:48.677]  Again, fund the InfoWars.
[03:23:48.798 --> 03:23:52.762]  Get the game-changing Nanotech tubes from Buck Rogers.
[03:23:53.263 --> 03:23:55.285]  It's a win-win.
[03:23:55.746 --> 03:23:55.285]  $200.
[03:23:55.866 --> 03:23:58.810]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:23:58.910 --> 03:23:59.611]  It's amazing.

[03:25:14.682 --> 03:25:15.422]  Absolutely.
[03:25:16.143 --> 03:25:16.683]  Good stuff.
[03:25:17.504 --> 03:25:20.085]  Anthony Cumia back on Infowars.com.
[03:25:21.506 --> 03:25:25.188]  Wanted to talk also about this story just kind of disappeared.
[03:25:25.468 --> 03:25:31.012]  Is this becoming such commonplace that it just doesn't make the news anymore?
[03:25:31.052 --> 03:25:31.992]  It's not exciting enough?
[03:25:32.312 --> 03:25:36.335]  There was an absolute terrorist attack at a Michigan airport.
[03:25:37.364 --> 03:25:47.049]  At Bishop Airport in Michigan, a gentleman, Canadian, of Tunisian descent.
[03:25:47.129 --> 03:25:49.150]  He came from Tunisia.
[03:25:50.613 --> 03:25:55.795]  Uh, decided to, uh, go up to a police officer at Bishop Airport in Flint, Michigan.
[03:25:56.055 --> 03:25:57.616]  The lovely Flint, Michigan.
[03:25:58.316 --> 03:26:01.437]  And, uh, yell, ALLAHU AKBAR!
[03:26:01.937 --> 03:26:03.218]  ALLAHU AKBAR!
[03:26:03.938 --> 03:26:07.179]  And, uh, stab an officer in the neck.
[03:26:08.479 --> 03:26:12.341]  Uh, thank goodness he underwent surgery and is in a stable condition.
[03:26:13.701 --> 03:26:15.542]  But, uh, wah, wah.
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:16.880]  What happens?
[03:26:17.040 --> 03:26:22.524]  Now we don't even really, we don't even really talk about this in mainstream media?
[03:26:23.145 --> 03:26:31.130]  We used to at least force them to address that Islamic terrorism is happening in our country and at our airports.
[03:26:32.731 --> 03:26:33.071]  Now?
[03:26:34.032 --> 03:26:36.153]  Ah, we got to do something.
[03:26:36.233 --> 03:26:36.794]  What's happening?
[03:26:36.834 --> 03:26:39.516]  Healthcare, oh my god, we got to listen to Chuck Schumer.
[03:26:40.487 --> 03:26:44.611]  And Nancy Pelosi, bash anything Donald Trump wants to do.
[03:26:45.491 --> 03:26:46.512]  That'll make the news.
[03:26:46.793 --> 03:26:51.917]  You'll watch their incoherent babble on mainstream media.
[03:26:52.177 --> 03:27:01.606]  But there was a terrorist event at Flint, Michigan airport, and it barely made any news.
[03:27:03.487 --> 03:27:04.848]  Is this what we have to look forward to?
[03:27:05.765 --> 03:27:10.167]  That it's just become so accepted that no one really wants to even address it.
[03:27:11.148 --> 03:27:13.069]  Except Michael Moore, of course.
[03:27:13.549 --> 03:27:15.290]  Flint, Michigan's own Michael Moore.
[03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:16.971]  Oh, that's right.
[03:27:17.471 --> 03:27:19.252]  He doesn't live near Flint at all.
[03:27:20.633 --> 03:27:24.835]  He lives in a wonderful mansion in a wonderful part of Michigan.
[03:27:25.996 --> 03:27:29.518]  But, he has to comment on this.
[03:27:30.018 --> 03:27:31.119]  He actually said,
[03:27:32.535 --> 03:27:49.229]  If you're going to condemn this terrorism that took place at Bishop Airport, then you must also condemn the terrorism that was the governor poisoning the water of the fine folks of Flint, Michigan.
[03:27:52.116 --> 03:27:59.983]  That it was done on purpose, assuming that whoever the powers that be there in Michigan decided to poison the water.
[03:28:00.703 --> 03:28:15.356]  Now, I will never deny that some horrid misappropriations of funds and negligence on the part of the government to save money or to line their own pockets were responsible for
[03:28:16.457 --> 03:28:16.937]  We're good.
[03:28:36.595 --> 03:28:39.076]  Uh, took the word out of circulation.
[03:28:39.096 --> 03:28:41.236]  You just made that word mean nothing.
[03:28:41.896 --> 03:28:45.577]  When everyone is a terrorist, no one's a terrorist.
[03:28:45.837 --> 03:28:46.558]  You see how that works?
[03:28:47.978 --> 03:28:56.220]  So, when he's equating government incompetence, which is rampant in this country, to terrorism,
[03:28:57.798 --> 03:29:06.160]  You're actually lowering the bar for what it takes to label something terrorist.
[03:29:06.421 --> 03:29:08.761]  Now it might sound like I'm arguing semantics here, but no.
[03:29:09.661 --> 03:29:13.162]  Language and words are very important tools to the left.
[03:29:13.623 --> 03:29:19.164]  They love naming things to either give or eliminate their power.
[03:29:19.804 --> 03:29:21.825]  We're gonna take a little time here.
[03:29:22.045 --> 03:29:22.905]  You gotta see this.
[03:29:23.825 --> 03:29:25.506]  It's Stephen Colbert.
[03:29:26.506 --> 03:29:27.327]  Doing his, what is it?
[03:29:27.407 --> 03:29:27.688]  Tuck?
[03:29:28.789 --> 03:29:29.470]  Tuck what?
[03:29:32.533 --> 03:29:35.857]  And then Alex is gonna come on and it's a parody.
[03:29:36.417 --> 03:29:37.579]  It's really hysterical.
[03:29:38.159 --> 03:29:41.042]  I implore you to watch this.
[03:29:41.303 --> 03:29:42.003]  Great spoof.
[03:29:42.764 --> 03:29:44.666]  And we'll be back on InfoWars.com.
[03:29:52.512 --> 03:29:55.495]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.437 --> 03:29:59.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:04.674 --> 03:30:08.257]  Wow, you're going to love the latest idea out of the EU.
[03:30:08.497 --> 03:30:18.904]  Scott Keller, a German member of the European Parliament and of the Green Party, said we should transplant entire villages from Syria to Germany and that would encourage more migrants to enter Germany.
[03:30:19.064 --> 03:30:20.084]  Listen to these quotes.
[03:30:20.345 --> 03:30:28.170]  The idea of Syrian villages is only one possibility we can use, for example, if refugees don't want to go to a country alone that has no other refugees.
[03:30:28.410 --> 03:30:33.731]  People would rather go where compatriots already live, which makes integration and acceptance easier.
[03:30:33.891 --> 03:30:35.612]  Let's look at these three compatriots.
[03:30:35.892 --> 03:30:36.912]  From Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:30:37.152 --> 03:30:37.532]  Sweden.
[03:30:37.572 --> 03:30:40.233]  Migrants viciously beat disabled man while calling him racist.
[03:30:40.513 --> 03:30:46.634]  Three compatriot refugees attempted to steal a homeless man's wallet in a train station during an incident which took place last month.
[03:30:46.714 --> 03:30:53.736]  The handicapped man was kicked and punched and received a vicious uppercut as one of the migrants lectured him about war on Muslims and how all Swedes were racist.
[03:30:54.036 --> 03:30:55.778]  Now how's that for acceptance?
[03:30:55.959 --> 03:30:58.962]  You can read both articles now on InfoWars.com.
[03:30:59.223 --> 03:31:02.386]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:31:03.916 --> 03:31:04.456]  I do not agree.
[03:31:04.496 --> 03:31:05.898]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:31:05.938 --> 03:31:07.019]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:31:07.279 --> 03:31:08.200]  Why is this so good?
[03:31:08.480 --> 03:31:13.724]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:31:13.804 --> 03:31:27.375]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:31:27.435 --> 03:31:28.817]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:31:29.577 --> 03:31:31.138]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:31:31.218 --> 03:31:33.721]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:31:33.801 --> 03:31:35.082]  These are all parasites.
[03:31:35.122 --> 03:31:36.223]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:31:36.243 --> 03:31:37.283]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:31:37.584 --> 03:31:41.927]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:31:42.107 --> 03:31:45.270]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:31:45.390 --> 03:31:48.434]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:31:48.474 --> 03:31:49.475]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:31:49.535 --> 03:31:51.418]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:51.478 --> 03:31:52.479]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:31:52.499 --> 03:31:54.581]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:31:55.222 --> 03:31:58.246]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:58.506 --> 03:32:00.389]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:32:00.769 --> 03:32:02.732]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:32:04.099 --> 03:32:07.640]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[03:32:08.101 --> 03:32:14.123]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[03:32:14.543 --> 03:32:17.324]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:17.704 --> 03:32:20.725]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:32:20.925 --> 03:32:24.367]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[03:32:24.707 --> 03:32:25.167]  The left
[03:32:25.507 --> 03:32:26.448]  ...controls culture.
[03:32:26.488 --> 03:32:27.449]  They control arts.
[03:32:27.529 --> 03:32:28.750]  They control entertainment.
[03:32:29.050 --> 03:32:36.137]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:32:36.197 --> 03:32:38.599]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[03:32:39.080 --> 03:32:42.944]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[03:32:43.004 --> 03:32:45.065]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[03:32:45.686 --> 03:32:51.070]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[03:32:51.310 --> 03:32:57.555]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[03:32:57.635 --> 03:32:59.337]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[03:32:59.497 --> 03:33:00.678]  It's available right now.
[03:33:00.998 --> 03:33:03.160]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[03:33:20.109 --> 03:33:24.016]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:25.618 --> 03:33:30.326]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:34.059 --> 03:33:41.462]  Brain Fight is brought to you by Brain Fart Plus with extra fluoride so that your days are happy and dim.
[03:33:42.322 --> 03:33:44.643]  And of course, the formula that I developed myself.
[03:33:44.984 --> 03:33:53.207]  That's the Super Cuck Beta Male that everyone should be taking so we can get our orders from Hillary and know that she wears the pants around here.
[03:33:54.741 --> 03:34:06.910]  Now I understand what Alex Jones is going through personally, because for years, I'm not telling anything you guys don't know, I've also been playing a right-wing radio host, my beloved character, Tuck Buckford.
[03:34:13.419 --> 03:34:14.520]  Thank you, yes, yes.
[03:34:15.020 --> 03:34:19.082]  Welcome to Brain Fight, ladies and gentlemen, with the real Tuck Budford.
[03:34:19.642 --> 03:34:29.647]  And I tell you, I want to thank tonight CBS News for allowing me to set the record straight about a public enemy number one and a scourge of America and the world.
[03:34:30.367 --> 03:34:34.971]  I'm not talking about Stephen Colbert, I'm talking about Alex Jones of Infowars.
[03:34:35.411 --> 03:34:42.396]  That enemy of America stole my identity back in high school and my manly power, my manly voice.
[03:34:42.776 --> 03:34:46.579]  He took it from me and then spread his evil lies across the country and the world.
[03:34:46.960 --> 03:34:55.946]  And he stole not just my persona, he then projected his right-wing evil, unalloyed racist views over me.
[03:34:56.887 --> 03:35:03.932]  And then that got picked up by Stephen Colbert, who unknowingly stole the identity of someone that had stolen my identity.
[03:35:04.452 --> 03:35:14.739]  So here tonight, thanks to CBS, here at Brain Fight with the real Tuck Buckford, I am gonna set the record straight about the fact that Alex Jones is a damn liar.
[03:35:14.759 --> 03:35:16.320]  I'm a pioneer!
[03:35:16.340 --> 03:35:17.561]  I'm an explorer!
[03:35:19.645 --> 03:35:32.430]  Alex Jones would take a real piece of news like this out of Associated Press, but it sounds all crazy and he'd make a big deal out of it.
[03:35:32.770 --> 03:35:34.891]  But I actually think this is a great idea.
[03:35:35.111 --> 03:35:38.833]  In fact, it should be the new Chonani yogurt flavor.
[03:35:39.153 --> 03:35:39.713]  Look at this.
[03:35:40.094 --> 03:35:45.036]  Dried lizard penises from India sold as good luck charms.
[03:35:45.096 --> 03:35:50.279]  Now, Alex Jones would sit there and say there's a problem with that and try to scare people.
[03:35:50.880 --> 03:35:59.745]  Now, let's look at another dried lizard penis reanimated with all sorts of, you know, baby blood they're pumping through his arteries.
[03:35:59.885 --> 03:36:00.745]  I'm totally for it.
[03:36:00.785 --> 03:36:01.466]  I think it's great.
[03:36:02.066 --> 03:36:07.068]  Wow, that's Bill Clinton ditched Secret Service on multiple Lolita Express flights.
[03:36:07.548 --> 03:36:08.928]  Wow, that's mainstream news.
[03:36:08.988 --> 03:36:09.648]  Hell yeah!
[03:36:10.128 --> 03:36:11.169]  Here's an article right here.
[03:36:11.229 --> 03:36:12.989]  Latest WikiLeaks, those traitors.
[03:36:13.469 --> 03:36:18.671]  Cherry Blossom exposes CIR wireless hacking, where they load it on all your different
[03:36:18.931 --> 03:36:23.053]  Wireless devices, CIA software to track and listen to everything you did.
[03:36:23.313 --> 03:36:27.034]  Another thing Alex Jones was right about that traitor, piece of filth.
[03:36:27.214 --> 03:36:31.616]  How dare him release that they're kidnapping kids and spying on you illegal.
[03:36:31.756 --> 03:36:33.197]  That traitor is piece of crap.
[03:36:34.265 --> 03:36:37.566]  There's another big problem I've got right now on Brain Fight.
[03:36:38.026 --> 03:36:39.926]  Remember that congressman Steve Scalise?
[03:36:40.246 --> 03:36:44.767]  He's also been speaking out against child trafficking among four-shot at baseball field.
[03:36:45.408 --> 03:36:46.788]  Well, Tuck Budford likes it.
[03:36:47.028 --> 03:36:47.908]  I'm a Democrat.
[03:36:48.208 --> 03:36:53.810]  I'm like the guy that did it when Wolf Blitzer went on the news and interviewed his friend and they said, he's not evil.
[03:36:54.110 --> 03:36:55.150]  He's just political.
[03:36:55.490 --> 03:36:56.150]  That's right.
[03:36:56.170 --> 03:36:58.511]  It's political if we kill you.
[03:36:58.731 --> 03:36:59.611]  Let's play a clip.
[03:37:00.618 --> 03:37:12.267]  We're just getting some tape in of an acquaintance of James Hodgkinson, the 66-year-old shooter, describing some of his political, perhaps, motivations.
[03:37:12.307 --> 03:37:12.808]  Listen to this.
[03:37:14.169 --> 03:37:17.091]  I just want to let people know that he wasn't evil.
[03:37:18.212 --> 03:37:21.735]  That he was, I guess, tired of some of the politics that's going on.
[03:37:23.582 --> 03:37:28.167]  We just heard that perhaps he wasn't evil, just tired of the politics that's going on.
[03:37:28.187 --> 03:37:29.788]  Tom Prentice of the FBI.
[03:37:30.248 --> 03:37:31.289]  Woo!
[03:37:31.430 --> 03:37:34.793]  Tuck's just getting started and wound up.
[03:37:34.913 --> 03:37:36.695]  I love another Democrat I like.
[03:37:37.495 --> 03:37:38.296]  Just like that.
[03:37:38.677 --> 03:37:41.359]  Just like that sweetie pie Stephen Colbert.
[03:37:41.379 --> 03:37:44.302]  That fancy sounding French name.
[03:37:44.942 --> 03:37:45.263]  Woo!
[03:37:45.503 --> 03:37:45.963]  I like that.
[03:37:46.024 --> 03:37:46.124]  Woo!
[03:37:46.644 --> 03:37:51.249]  In the hours after five people were shot, including the House Majority Whip, you sent
[03:38:03.493 --> 03:38:08.856]  I mean, it was clearly a reference to the assassination attempt against Congressman Scalise.
[03:38:09.056 --> 03:38:12.298]  It's hard to imagine how you could justify writing something like that.
[03:38:12.498 --> 03:38:19.141]  For too long, Republicans in this country have failed to distinguish the differences between politics and war.
[03:38:19.662 --> 03:38:22.243]  And a lot of Democrats have failed to see the similarities.
[03:38:22.663 --> 03:38:25.825]  So you guys either have to tone down the rhetoric or we have to step up.
[03:38:26.805 --> 03:38:28.706]  Oh, I love it, boy, I tell ya.
[03:38:29.106 --> 03:38:30.767]  I agree with the Democrats on that.
[03:38:30.807 --> 03:38:31.907]  I'm a registered Democrat.
[03:38:32.148 --> 03:38:34.989]  Here's another one, a fellow wearing a Trump hat.
[03:38:35.309 --> 03:38:38.870]  They said, get ready to be shanked, Whitey, and stabbed him nine times.
[03:38:39.271 --> 03:38:41.472]  He's fighting for his life right now.
[03:38:41.672 --> 03:38:42.032]  Woo-hoo!
[03:38:42.472 --> 03:38:45.293]  When I talk about a political revolution, this is what I'm talking about.
[03:39:06.458 --> 03:39:12.102]  ...is for people all over this country to put pressure on every level of government.
[03:39:12.522 --> 03:39:14.504]  But we've got to stand up and fight back.
[03:39:14.824 --> 03:39:20.027]  We have got to be involved in the political process in a way that we have never been before.
[03:39:20.828 --> 03:39:23.850]  You have got to, Mary, act in an unprecedented way.
[03:39:24.010 --> 03:39:24.530]  Think big.
[03:39:25.091 --> 03:39:27.152]  Get involved in every way that you can.
[03:39:27.732 --> 03:39:30.414]  So, Mary, stand up and fight back in every way that you can.
[03:39:33.331 --> 03:39:33.611]  Wow!
[03:39:34.371 --> 03:39:43.515]  You know old Tuck, old Tuck sometimes though does take that super male vitality that Alex Jones sells at InfoWarsLive.com and I need to settle down!
[03:39:44.375 --> 03:39:45.975]  There's only one way for me to settle down.
[03:39:45.995 --> 03:39:57.279]  I do what old Stephen Colbert says and I take the super cuck beta male vitality to try to counterbalance a little bit of the old manliness I'm about to get into with the gay frogs.
[03:39:57.299 --> 03:39:59.000]  Let me just take a little bit of this because it's so strong.
[03:39:59.760 --> 03:40:02.084]  Oh, that's good stuff right there.
[03:40:02.104 --> 03:40:03.365]  Let me calm down.
[03:40:03.445 --> 03:40:06.370]  Oh, lordy, lordy.
[03:40:06.390 --> 03:40:11.477]  I'm feeling a little bit better now.
[03:40:11.497 --> 03:40:14.140]  Now let me get to the real news while we were talking about this.
[03:40:15.081 --> 03:40:22.649]  The truth is Jones is telling you about gay frogs and gay fish and all the rest of this because he doesn't want you to be liberated from your male vitality.
[03:40:23.330 --> 03:40:31.138]  And the truth is the good people at CBS and others have been running this good program for you and your family to drink Bisphenol A.
[03:40:32.038 --> 03:40:51.808]  All the other estrogen mimickers that are out there, so let me show you some of the mainstream news telling you about the animals, so you can understand just what a big liar Alex Jones is, misrepresenting the fact that I believe that we should take estrogen, and I believe we should get the increased cancers that come along with it, and that none of us should have a debate about this.
[03:40:51.848 --> 03:40:57.711]  So, I'm gonna show you this, but just like they said on CNN, only I can show you the WikiLeaks, nobody else can.
[03:40:57.851 --> 03:41:01.013]  Only good old Tuck Buckford, and this is not a toupee by the way,
[03:41:01.633 --> 03:41:06.655]  Also interesting is, remember, it's illegal to possess these stolen documents.
[03:41:06.695 --> 03:41:07.695]  It's different for the media.
[03:41:07.715 --> 03:41:10.596]  So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us.
[03:41:10.856 --> 03:41:14.597]  And in full disclosure, let's take a look at what is in there and what it means.
[03:41:14.737 --> 03:41:16.357]  I'm not a toupee, by the way.
[03:41:16.377 --> 03:41:19.498]  It's brought to you by lizard penis-flavored yogurt.
[03:41:19.939 --> 03:41:20.559]  Here you go.
[03:41:20.799 --> 03:41:24.420]  Animal sexual changes linked to waste chemicals.
[03:41:25.390 --> 03:41:31.679]  And it reports that the majority in these studies of the frogs are now bisexual or gay or sterilized.
[03:41:32.099 --> 03:41:34.723]  But again, you need to look into that for yourself.
[03:41:34.803 --> 03:41:39.669]  Male frogs may be turning female thanks to estrogen in suburban waste.
[03:41:40.550 --> 03:41:42.492]  Continuing, here's a new one.
[03:41:43.012 --> 03:41:46.895]  85% of the smallmouth bass have signs of female reproductive parts.
[03:41:47.375 --> 03:41:51.739]  Of the largemouth bass, 27% were intersex or bisexual.
[03:41:52.299 --> 03:41:54.881]  And again, I think we shouldn't have a debate about this.
[03:41:55.201 --> 03:41:58.664]  And I think Alex Jones ought to be arrested for talking about it.
[03:41:58.724 --> 03:42:02.287]  I'm glad there's a big national joke about all that.
[03:42:03.087 --> 03:42:09.150]  And then finally, that leads me, ladies and gentlemen, to my final big point here that I hadn't gotten to yet.
[03:42:09.470 --> 03:42:10.151]  Lordy, lordy.
[03:42:10.831 --> 03:42:12.092]  And that's North Korea.
[03:42:12.932 --> 03:42:29.261]  I saw the old network that I was on over there on Comedy Central, and they were making big jokes about what happened to Otto Warmbier, who died in a coma after 16 months in North Korea, for supposedly taking a poster off the wall.
[03:42:30.021 --> 03:42:38.763]  Well, turns out Larry Wilmore did a big roast and made fun of him because he was a white ass and basically deserved it.
[03:42:38.943 --> 03:42:43.865]  No, tonight's story is about the North Korean government which recently captured one of America's most annoying exports.
[03:42:44.165 --> 03:42:44.945]  A frat bro.
[03:42:45.245 --> 03:42:50.226]  Otto Frederick Warmbier is a University of Virginia student now being detained by North Korea.
[03:42:50.266 --> 03:42:51.287]  Okay, so what'd he do wrong?
[03:42:51.667 --> 03:42:55.848]  He's accused of trying to steal a North Korean political banner from his hotel.
[03:42:57.529 --> 03:42:59.170]  Okay, listen up, frat boy.
[03:43:00.451 --> 03:43:04.414]  This isn't like the time you stole SIGGAP's goat.
[03:43:06.095 --> 03:43:09.397]  Okay, so maybe he isn't some sophisticated undercover mastermind.
[03:43:09.438 --> 03:43:14.801]  I entirely beg you for the governance of the DPR Korea.
[03:43:23.701 --> 03:43:29.764]  I'm sorry guys, it's just tough for me to have much sympathy for this guy and his crocodile tears because he allegedly stole this North Korean hotel banner.
[03:43:30.144 --> 03:43:40.469]  And this is the kind of attitude we need from the left here is defending North Korea and then calling and celebrating for the imprisonment and enslavement
[03:43:40.469 --> 03:43:41.449]  Donald Trump.
[03:43:57.117 --> 03:44:00.219]  Keep his mouth shut here for a minute because I'm not like Alex Jones.
[03:44:00.800 --> 03:44:02.000]  I don't believe in political violence.
[03:44:02.020 --> 03:44:03.581]  That's why I promote it continually.
[03:44:03.902 --> 03:44:09.025]  That's called the oxymoron leftist mind control system that I bought into because I want to be in charge.
[03:44:09.325 --> 03:44:19.092]  We have a record high stock market, three plus trillion dollars, and he took us out of these multinational secret deals that took over Congress like the TPP and the carbon tax.
[03:44:19.532 --> 03:44:24.615]  And now new big studies and mainstream news report it wasn't 3.3 million illegals that may have voted but 5.7
[03:44:25.996 --> 03:44:26.877]  He lied to us.
[03:44:26.917 --> 03:44:27.618]  He said it was only 3.2, 3.3.
[03:44:27.879 --> 03:44:33.446]  He lied to us when it was 2 million or more than that.
[03:44:33.907 --> 03:44:38.714]  And he just, he just, he's the biggest liar keeping his promises I've ever seen.
[03:44:39.234 --> 03:44:42.379]  So when they have Shakespeare in the park saying kill Trump, it's no big deal.
[03:44:43.520 --> 03:44:45.301]  Madonna says kill him, blow him up.
[03:44:45.901 --> 03:44:50.224]  It's the coolest thing to do in the world, but the left then claims that the right wing's violent, because they are.
[03:44:50.244 --> 03:44:54.067]  I just want to say, you know, this isn't violent at all, okay?
[03:44:54.347 --> 03:44:57.749]  This right here, this is not violent at all, but I do this to Trump.
[03:44:58.089 --> 03:44:58.710]  You understand?
[03:44:59.270 --> 03:45:01.132]  Let me just explain that to everybody.
[03:45:01.332 --> 03:45:11.519]  I mean, if I sit here and just start ripping his head off and doing this, this is liberal, and this is open, and we ban free speech on colleges and arrest everybody, it's a good thing, okay?
[03:45:12.339 --> 03:45:21.541]  So, let's get that straight right now that the real Tuck Buckford's here and Alex Jones and all the rest of them better understand that we run this country now!
[03:45:23.181 --> 03:45:24.241]  Like North Korea!
[03:45:24.741 --> 03:45:25.721]  And I like Colbert!
[03:45:25.741 --> 03:45:29.322]  I don't want the tens of millions he gets selling out of America!
[03:45:29.342 --> 03:45:31.082]  I love it!
[03:45:31.502 --> 03:45:33.103]  I absolutely love it!
[03:45:33.343 --> 03:45:35.303]  Tuck Buckford loves Colbert!
[03:45:35.703 --> 03:45:37.184]  But I hate Alex Jones!
[03:45:37.844 --> 03:45:38.964]  It's brain fight!
[03:45:39.004 --> 03:45:39.184]  Yeah!
[03:45:41.755 --> 03:45:49.056]  Brain Fight is brought to you by Brain Fart Plus with extra fluoride so that your days are happy and dim.
[03:45:50.036 --> 03:45:52.337]  And of course, the formula that I developed myself.
[03:45:52.677 --> 03:46:00.978]  That's the Super Cup Beta Male that everyone should be taking so we can get our orders from Hillary and know that she wears the pants around here.
[03:46:06.279 --> 03:46:06.739]  Yogurt.
[03:46:07.099 --> 03:46:09.000]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing.
[03:46:14.572 --> 03:46:17.696]  Oh man, that was really funny.
[03:46:18.377 --> 03:46:19.278]  Holy jeez.
[03:46:21.360 --> 03:46:31.091]  And I'm certain no one is going to, out of context, pull some of the clips, especially of him ripping Donald Trump's face off.
[03:46:33.673 --> 03:46:34.954]  Oh man, that was really good.
[03:46:35.455 --> 03:46:37.597]  You know what's great about that?
[03:46:38.417 --> 03:46:42.761]  Obviously shows... Oh my goodness.
[03:46:43.282 --> 03:46:47.526]  Obviously it shows Alex has a sense of humor about himself.
[03:46:48.929 --> 03:46:57.175]  Uh, something that people really don't, uh, I don't think they see a lot of times, especially people that don't appreciate Alex.
[03:46:57.455 --> 03:47:01.958]  But also, he's making a great point in that whole parody.
[03:47:02.799 --> 03:47:12.346]  Alex, over the course of the years, has always been looked at by mainstream media and the people that are so brainwashed by mainstream media as a nutty guy.
[03:47:14.047 --> 03:47:27.236]  They talk about the stories that he covers like they're all some whacked out conspiratorial fantasy that he's coming up with on a daily basis.
[03:47:28.096 --> 03:47:37.163]  He just proved, in a hysterical fashion, that mainstream media are talking about the same stories he talks about.
[03:47:38.337 --> 03:47:42.458]  I mean, you know, you could say something like, oh my God, gay frogs.
[03:47:42.798 --> 03:47:43.419]  Did you hear that?
[03:47:43.599 --> 03:47:45.259]  Alex Jones is talking about gay frogs.
[03:47:45.279 --> 03:47:46.059]  That's insane.
[03:47:46.579 --> 03:47:47.200]  He's a nut.
[03:47:47.900 --> 03:47:50.661]  And then National Geographic.
[03:47:51.301 --> 03:48:02.444]  That was a National Geographic Society story about frogs and toxins in the atmosphere and the water and their food.
[03:48:02.744 --> 03:48:05.225]  That is changing their genetic makeup.
[03:48:06.959 --> 03:48:07.639]  So that's crazy.
[03:48:10.201 --> 03:48:10.621]  Bravo.
[03:48:10.681 --> 03:48:12.102]  That was really funny.
[03:48:12.382 --> 03:48:23.050]  He also brings up a great point on how the left looked at Otto Warmbier when he was arrested in Korea.
[03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.771]  It was a big joke.
[03:48:25.834 --> 03:48:36.896]  It was a big joke that a white frat boy was arrested by a horrible, horrible regime for nothing.
[03:48:37.317 --> 03:48:38.137]  For nothing.
[03:48:39.697 --> 03:48:41.518]  And imprisoned over there.
[03:48:43.158 --> 03:48:43.718]  And murdered.
[03:48:44.258 --> 03:48:44.638]  Murdered.
[03:48:45.018 --> 03:48:46.299]  Let's be real here.
[03:48:46.659 --> 03:48:49.079]  I don't care that they sent him back to the U.S.
[03:48:49.559 --> 03:48:52.160]  in what was far worse than a coma.
[03:48:53.849 --> 03:48:58.573]  Uh, with a severe brain damage and physical, um, damage to his organs.
[03:48:58.933 --> 03:49:02.255]  And, um, they sent him here to die.
[03:49:03.176 --> 03:49:05.658]  They sent him here to die so he wouldn't die over there.
[03:49:06.278 --> 03:49:08.940]  Um, and the left found that funny.
[03:49:09.991 --> 03:49:14.697]  He found that he was imprisoned, enslaved over there, and murdered.
[03:49:15.418 --> 03:49:27.695]  An American citizen, a young American citizen, regardless of how you feel about what he supposedly did, which was nothing more than, if he did do it, trying to take a banner off a wall.
[03:49:30.272 --> 03:49:35.334]  He's a young kid, does stupid stuff, and that's the big issue.
[03:49:35.814 --> 03:49:37.635]  That should cost him his life.
[03:49:38.215 --> 03:49:46.517]  This wasn't somebody grabbing for a police officer's gun or committing a violent crime.
[03:49:47.418 --> 03:49:49.658]  They thought it was hilarious.
[03:49:50.639 --> 03:49:52.079]  And they ship him over here dead.
[03:49:53.039 --> 03:49:54.860]  Hearing from his parents was heartbreaking.
[03:49:55.882 --> 03:50:01.867]  How the Obama administration and Obama himself had told his parents not to do anything.
[03:50:02.988 --> 03:50:06.811]  Don't hang ribbons out for your boy.
[03:50:07.251 --> 03:50:22.924]  Don't go on the media and talk about his plight and try your best to get public opinion on your side so you can perhaps free your son from this horrid imprisonment over in North Korea.
[03:50:23.897 --> 03:50:31.681]  Obama, the Obama administration, the Secretary of State did nothing, did nothing to free this young man.
[03:50:32.201 --> 03:50:40.585]  It took Trump to actually get him back here right before he died of murder.
[03:50:41.326 --> 03:50:44.567]  This boy was murdered by the government of North Korea.
[03:50:46.425 --> 03:50:47.106]  Are we coming back?
[03:50:47.146 --> 03:50:47.886]  We're coming back, right?
[03:50:47.926 --> 03:50:48.607]  For a few more minutes?
[03:50:49.288 --> 03:50:50.028]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:50:50.469 --> 03:50:54.693]  Anthony Cumia, compoundmedia.com, in at infowars.com.
[03:50:54.733 --> 03:50:55.834]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:50:56.294 --> 03:50:56.995]  Do not stray.
[03:51:07.068 --> 03:51:11.110]  Democracy Partners attacks Veritas launches $1 million federal lawsuit.
[03:51:11.230 --> 03:51:13.292]  And so that's where all of this is going.
[03:51:13.312 --> 03:51:14.072]  And he joins us.
[03:51:14.472 --> 03:51:15.233]  Remember the clips.
[03:51:15.293 --> 03:51:17.154]  Talk about game changer in the election.
[03:51:17.314 --> 03:51:19.916]  It's not true that I or you defeated Hillary.
[03:51:20.016 --> 03:51:21.557]  She's blamed 20 different groups.
[03:51:22.257 --> 03:51:28.741]  Veritas, Drudge, Infowars, the Russians, misogyny, racism, never!
[03:51:29.101 --> 03:51:31.142]  The fact that people are sick of her and her policies.
[03:51:32.383 --> 03:51:33.964]  So James O'Keefe, thanks for joining us.
[03:51:34.773 --> 03:51:35.814]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[03:51:35.894 --> 03:51:38.356]  I think reality defeated Hillary Clinton.
[03:51:38.376 --> 03:51:40.597]  You know, the truth defeated Hillary Clinton.
[03:51:40.677 --> 03:51:51.044]  And now, just yesterday, it was announced a lawsuit, a million-dollar lawsuit, against my team, Veritas, from this guy, Bob Kramer, who's one of Barack Obama's close friends.
[03:51:51.845 --> 03:51:53.526]  We're basically retaliating, you know.
[03:51:53.586 --> 03:51:55.587]  We exposed the fraud during the election.
[03:51:55.627 --> 03:52:02.392]  We exposed the four-part series, sending shockwaves to the DNC about voter fraud, use of dark money.
[03:52:03.092 --> 03:52:06.633]  I'm an overseas donor to arrange these types of things.
[03:52:06.693 --> 03:52:09.634]  So they sued me for a million dollars and they want to shut us down.
[03:52:09.674 --> 03:52:11.135]  Then I get calls from Politico.
[03:52:11.155 --> 03:52:15.837]  I get calls from all these mainstream outlets that suddenly want to talk to me now that I'm being sued.
[03:52:16.477 --> 03:52:18.117]  And I want to know who's funding this lawsuit.
[03:52:18.317 --> 03:52:21.298]  I said that over my dead body will I ever shut up.
[03:52:21.358 --> 03:52:28.461]  Bob Kramer, Barack Obama's friend and the person Hillary Clinton had to fire, is now suing me for a million dollars for the videos that we did during the election.
[03:52:28.601 --> 03:52:37.215]  To me, this is about just silencing you, but more importantly, intimidating other people that, oh look, we'll sue you if you do more stuff like James O'Keefe did.
[03:52:38.334 --> 03:52:42.097]  Yeah, I mean, I think investigative journalism itself is on the line.
[03:52:42.317 --> 03:52:49.863]  I mean, a lot of media companies don't have the brass balls it takes to go out and speak truth to power.
[03:52:50.063 --> 03:53:02.032]  I said on your show before that a lot of these journalists, a lot of these media organizations can't do the job because they're worried about the government regulators coming after them, let's say if Hillary was elected.
[03:53:02.672 --> 03:53:14.961]  And we went out on a limb and did it, and they're trying to deter us and establishment news organizations from speaking truth to power against the establishment because this is what happens to you when you do so.
[03:53:15.001 --> 03:53:16.623]  You get sued for a million dollars.
[03:53:16.683 --> 03:53:17.844]  This is a press stunt.
[03:53:18.284 --> 03:53:19.745]  Kramer is pulling a million dollars.
[03:53:19.785 --> 03:53:20.986]  What does that even mean, a million dollars?
[03:53:21.266 --> 03:53:25.390]  And by the way, Alex, we live in a media environment where people can use anonymous sources.
[03:53:25.851 --> 03:53:30.835]  Every single claim that we make is buttressed by videotape of them saying what they said.
[03:53:30.895 --> 03:53:31.376]  Exactly.
[03:53:31.416 --> 03:53:33.098]  And yet, you're not supposed to believe us.
[03:53:33.118 --> 03:53:37.722]  You're supposed to believe all these journalists who use anonymous sources quoting hearsay from other anonymous sources.
[03:53:40.794 --> 03:53:42.275]  Well, you were sleeping
[03:54:10.153 --> 03:54:17.498]  For a limited time only, we're giving you 30 to 40% off on our InfoWars select storable food line at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:54:34.491 --> 03:54:36.053]  We don't know what's coming, do we?
[03:54:36.513 --> 03:54:39.757]  But we can start getting ready for whatever may happen today.

[03:54:50.208 --> 03:54:51.769]  Welcome back to InfoWars.com.
[03:54:51.789 --> 03:54:52.710]  I'm Anthony Cumia.
[03:54:54.611 --> 03:55:01.315]  I want to talk a little bit about the Georgia 6th District election that we saw.
[03:55:02.455 --> 03:55:07.918]  Karen Handel, the first GOP Congresswoman from Georgia.
[03:55:09.519 --> 03:55:12.320]  An amazing accomplishment for women.
[03:55:13.681 --> 03:55:20.305]  Didn't you see all the feminists and progressive women celebrating?
[03:55:21.078 --> 03:55:21.298]  No?
[03:55:21.779 --> 03:55:22.079]  Get it?
[03:55:22.960 --> 03:55:23.780]  I missed that, too.
[03:55:24.401 --> 03:55:25.722]  I missed that one, too.
[03:55:26.542 --> 03:55:32.707]  The feminist card gets played constantly, on a daily basis.
[03:55:33.528 --> 03:55:46.599]  And it's usually this horrible problem that the right has, that conservatives have, Republicans, that they hate women, apparently.
[03:55:47.506 --> 03:55:48.326]  Misogynistic.
[03:55:48.647 --> 03:55:53.949]  They're against women succeeding and breaking that glass ceiling and whatnot.
[03:55:55.050 --> 03:55:56.610]  Well, here we have a great example.
[03:55:57.431 --> 03:56:01.032]  In Georgia, a woman elected to Congress.
[03:56:01.633 --> 03:56:02.673]  A GOP woman.
[03:56:02.893 --> 03:56:03.494]  First one.
[03:56:04.694 --> 03:56:06.995]  First GOP woman elected to Congress in Georgia.
[03:56:07.615 --> 03:56:08.616]  And silence.
[03:56:09.496 --> 03:56:11.477]  Silence from the left.
[03:56:13.659 --> 03:56:16.422]  Again, they were very disappointed, the Democrats.
[03:56:17.563 --> 03:56:27.593]  I was watching some of the CNN and MSNBC coverage because I just love how disappointed they get during elections of late.
[03:56:29.525 --> 03:56:39.654]  So watching their coverage and seeing again, we got a little tidbit which reminded me of the Trump election, of course, the presidential election.
[03:56:39.974 --> 03:56:50.623]  Just watching the horrified faces of the media, CNN, MSNBC, the networks, mainstream media, just so disappointed.
[03:56:50.924 --> 03:56:53.006]  And seeing that again was just
[03:56:55.302 --> 03:56:55.922]  I loved it.
[03:56:56.263 --> 03:57:04.367]  I can't tell you how fun it is to watch disappointed lefties when their elections go awry.
[03:57:05.187 --> 03:57:09.210]  And again, we watched the media lie about this.
[03:57:09.610 --> 03:57:15.773]  We watched mainstream media throw up political polls that were completely wrong.
[03:57:16.714 --> 03:57:18.695]  They had Ossoff
[03:57:19.770 --> 03:57:37.077]  Ossoff, John Ossoff ahead in the polling and we're expecting a victory and well Karen Handel won and again it just shows how, there's my favorite picture.
[03:57:37.937 --> 03:57:40.678]  You can just see, look at their faces.
[03:57:41.019 --> 03:57:42.979]  Who's the guy in the middle there?
[03:57:43.079 --> 03:57:43.940]  Look at his knuckles.
[03:57:44.540 --> 03:57:45.922]  They couldn't be whiter.
[03:57:46.302 --> 03:57:50.006]  He is so angry and I can't get enough of it.
[03:57:50.487 --> 03:57:51.688]  Just too fun.
[03:57:54.711 --> 03:58:01.019]  They don't understand that when they consistently do what they do, which is lie to the American people,
[03:58:02.917 --> 03:58:10.965]  Scandal, cheats, cheat out their own side like we saw Hillary do to Bernie Sanders, that we don't trust them.
[03:58:11.505 --> 03:58:18.972]  And we are a large portion of the United States of America, contrary to their belief, that do not appreciate their hijinks.
[03:58:19.893 --> 03:58:20.793]  End shenanigans.
[03:58:21.414 --> 03:58:29.997]  And every election that has happened since the presidential election, a lot of these special elections have proven we'll have no part of it.
[03:58:30.257 --> 03:58:31.078]  Thank you very much.
[03:58:32.318 --> 03:58:35.179]  And thank you very much, InfoWars.com.
[03:58:35.239 --> 03:58:37.620]  I'm Anthony Cumia from CompoundMedia.com.
[03:58:37.800 --> 03:58:38.721]  We'll see you next time.
[03:58:38.781 --> 03:58:39.661]  Again, thank you, Alex.
[03:58:40.462 --> 03:58:41.262]  Have a great day.
[03:58:45.583 --> 03:58:49.566]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:58.353 --> 03:58:59.714]  Welcome back to Brain Fight.
[03:58:59.854 --> 03:59:01.416]  I'm the real Tuck Buckard.
[03:59:01.916 --> 03:59:08.641]  And coming up this Thursday, I'm going to be in Alex Jones' face, showing the world what a traitor and an enemy he is.
[03:59:08.942 --> 03:59:11.944]  Let's look at another dried lizard penis.
[03:59:12.124 --> 03:59:13.385]  Why, that's Bill Clinton.
[03:59:13.625 --> 03:59:14.086]  Yogurt.
[03:59:15.842 --> 03:59:17.765]  Tuck Buckford don't like Alex Jones.
[03:59:17.966 --> 03:59:19.789]  I want to bring up my next guest.
[03:59:21.072 --> 03:59:29.339]  Donald, John Trump, he's been on the show before and all of it's gonna be brought to you by CBS and that little angel Stephen Colbert.
[03:59:29.719 --> 03:59:35.884]  So join me this Thursday for the real brain fight during the Alex Jones Show 11 a.m.
[03:59:35.924 --> 03:59:36.465]  to 2 p.m.
[03:59:36.525 --> 03:59:38.967]  Central at that traitorous evil website.
[03:59:39.327 --> 03:59:43.210]  None of you should visit InfoWars.com.
[03:59:43.450 --> 03:59:45.632]  This is not violent at all, but I do this to Trump.
[03:59:45.672 --> 03:59:47.554]  Just do what CBS wants, that's good.
[03:59:47.994 --> 03:59:48.995]  I'm gonna do whatever my...
[03:59:55.929 --> 03:59:59.718]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order
