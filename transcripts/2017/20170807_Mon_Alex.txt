[00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:09.413]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:25.901]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:45.753]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide on this Monday.
[00:00:46.932 --> 00:00:49.954]  Already the 7th day of August 2017.
[00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:59.138]  Well, Peter Thiel has been hedging his bet on Donald Trump, telling folks publicly he thinks it's off to a terrific start, but hedging his bets 50-50, saying it's going to end in disaster.
[00:00:59.138 --> 00:01:03.441]  I'm going to tell you how the Trump administration is going to end one way or another when we come back.
[00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:05.822]  But first, the great news is this.
[00:01:05.822 --> 00:01:11.005]  The sleeping giant has awakened, and we can thank all of you out there and Donald Trump for that.
[00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:22.127]  Have you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania?
[00:01:22.127 --> 00:01:24.528]  Are there any Russians here tonight?
[00:01:24.528 --> 00:01:27.470]  Any Russians?
[00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.653]  They can't beat us at the voting booths.
[00:01:31.653 --> 00:01:36.677]  So they're trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want.
[00:01:37.777 --> 00:01:46.580]  They're trying to cheat you out of the leadership you want with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us.
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:55.762]  And most importantly, demeaning to our country and demeaning to our Constitution.
[00:01:55.762 --> 00:01:59.323]  You know, I've begged Trump to do fireside chats at least twice a week.
[00:01:59.323 --> 00:02:02.424]  But really, these are fireside chats with studio audiences.
[00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:04.165]  He must do a
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.121]  Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking
[00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:52.177]  Today, I tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democrat governor.
[00:02:52.177 --> 00:02:55.140]  Record Democrats converting to Republicans.
[00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.502]  They've lost every special election.
[00:02:57.502 --> 00:02:59.164]  There's been more than 100 of them.
[00:02:59.164 --> 00:03:01.927]  There's been four congressional special elections.
[00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:03.708]  All of them have been won by Trumpites.
[00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:09.358]  The Pauls are joining with Trump now, because they know he's for real.
[00:03:09.358 --> 00:03:13.280]  That's right, the Pauls, Rand Paul and others, are joining with Trump.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.921]  We have to give our full support to Trump.
[00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:17.863]  Getting chills right now, this is so epic.
[00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:23.386]  Yeah, if you're not all in now, folks, you know how much the globalists hate you, how much George Soros hates you?
[00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:26.887]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:03:26.887 --> 00:03:31.028]  This is like serial killer child molesters want full control.
[00:03:31.028 --> 00:03:32.848]  And it turns out that's what they are.
[00:03:32.848 --> 00:03:36.609]  But they're up there on national TV saying it's the end of Trump, the end of Trump.
[00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:37.370]  Everyone hates him.
[00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.050]  His base is turning against him.
[00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:47.393]  And then we can go get the corporate numbers, the inside numbers, the bot numbers, the computer numbers, just like we did during the campaign.
[00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:51.414]  And it shows Trump as popular as he's ever been, except for maybe
[00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.879]  Inauguration day and nomination day.
[00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.460]  I mean, those were his all-time highs.
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.242]  But all the AI systems predicted his win.
[00:04:05.242 --> 00:04:08.583]  And then you just see the numbers online and the support.
[00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:10.243]  It's only intensified.
[00:04:10.243 --> 00:04:12.564]  I saw his support dip big time.
[00:04:14.193 --> 00:04:20.358]  When he supported the bad version of Obamacare bill because he was lied to about what was in it, and they came out and said I was lied to.
[00:04:20.358 --> 00:04:24.401]  And then the fourth version, it was something Rand Paul said was good.
[00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:29.344]  And you notice the Republicans wouldn't pass it because they wanted to screw people, the Republican leadership.
[00:04:29.344 --> 00:04:31.066]  The Freedom Caucus supported it.
[00:04:31.066 --> 00:04:37.811]  Just like the Democrats have all gotten together and have agreed to just engage in criminal activity with the media.
[00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:46.671]  And to just do things they've never done before because it's seen as acceptable to be completely criminal.
[00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:54.979]  In this jihad of trying to keep the sleeping giant from awakening, the Lilliputians are in full panic mode.
[00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:58.730]  Here in Gulliver's Travel World.
[00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.710]  What is this thing?
[00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.711]  Where are you from?
[00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:02.331]  I'm from the island of Manhattan.
[00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:03.832]  Were you the president?
[00:05:03.832 --> 00:05:07.654]  I was actually known as President the... Awesome?
[00:05:07.654 --> 00:05:20.760]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called Stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[00:05:22.045 --> 00:05:34.033]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:50.343]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:55.789]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming, it's already here.
[00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:00.013]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.
[00:06:00.013 --> 00:06:01.735]  InfoWars.com.
[00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:10.965]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:06:10.965 --> 00:06:23.891]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:06:23.891 --> 00:06:30.474]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:06:30.474 --> 00:06:32.935]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[00:06:32.995 --> 00:06:44.227]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[00:06:44.227 --> 00:06:46.590]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.071]  We're getting results.
[00:06:48.071 --> 00:06:54.018]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:06:54.158 --> 00:06:57.040]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.

[00:08:07.303 --> 00:08:08.964]  This is a national emergency.
[00:08:08.964 --> 00:08:11.525]  Important instructions will follow.
[00:08:24.991 --> 00:08:31.398]  This message is transmitted at the request of the President of the United States of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[00:08:31.398 --> 00:08:36.964]  In compliance with the United Nations, the President of the United States has declared martial law.
[00:08:36.964 --> 00:08:38.586]  Curfew is now in place.
[00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:39.487]  Return to your homes.
[00:08:55.493 --> 00:09:21.287]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:09:21.287 --> 00:09:23.108]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:09:28.187 --> 00:09:29.708]  Zack, this is Crystal Palace.
[00:09:29.708 --> 00:09:29.868]  Inc.
[00:09:29.868 --> 00:09:31.849]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.
[00:09:31.849 --> 00:09:33.670]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.152]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:09:37.152 --> 00:09:40.794]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War 3.
[00:09:40.794 --> 00:09:43.155]  Target selection complete.
[00:09:43.155 --> 00:09:45.036]  Time-on-target sequence complete.
[00:09:45.036 --> 00:09:52.200]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning south out of Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.703]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:02.062]  From the front lines of the Information War.
[00:10:02.062 --> 00:10:04.463]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[00:10:04.463 --> 00:10:06.083]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:10.524]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[00:10:10.524 --> 00:10:11.665]  You bet!
[00:10:11.665 --> 00:10:15.966]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:18.927]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[00:10:18.927 --> 00:10:21.067]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[00:10:21.067 --> 00:10:24.808]  Shall we play a game?
[00:10:24.808 --> 00:10:25.368]  How about...
[00:10:32.367 --> 00:10:37.210]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.511]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:41.092]  Awaiting launch codes.
[00:10:41.092 --> 00:10:42.733]  We are on a launch mode.
[00:10:42.733 --> 00:10:46.635]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[00:10:46.635 --> 00:10:51.018]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:51.398]  We're in!
[00:10:51.398 --> 00:10:54.300]  The Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.381]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[00:10:56.841 --> 00:10:58.883]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[00:10:58.883 --> 00:11:00.364]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[00:11:00.364 --> 00:11:02.426]  Strange game.
[00:11:02.426 --> 00:11:17.297]  The only winning move is not to play.
[00:11:17.297 --> 00:11:20.080]  The problem with not playing the game is the Clintons
[00:11:21.564 --> 00:11:35.156]  And the same genius globalists that have got us into this situation we're currently in are the ones that gave North Korea the ICBMs and the nuclear reactors to be able to produce the fissile material.
[00:11:35.156 --> 00:11:44.684]  And they gave these individuals that can't even manufacture their own automobile, that can't even make their own power transformers,
[00:11:45.745 --> 00:11:48.367]  That can't even produce their own telephone lines.
[00:11:48.367 --> 00:11:51.009]  They have to ship it all in.
[00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:58.055]  But they got lots of uniforms and lots of artillery and lots of forced labor camps and death camps.
[00:11:58.055 --> 00:12:06.181]  And now they've got ICBMs that it's taken them more than 16, 17 years to even learn how to use.
[00:12:06.181 --> 00:12:07.843]  And they produce the fissile material.
[00:12:09.861 --> 00:12:18.426]  And the plan was the strategy of tension to bring in global government, to bring in more UN control, to clean up the North Korean problem.
[00:12:18.426 --> 00:12:30.432]  That's why they call it the strategy of tension and the strategy of patience and all this other garbage creating worldwide crises and then offering their solutions.
[00:12:30.432 --> 00:12:32.093]  And North Korea is in the news today.
[00:12:32.093 --> 00:12:33.014]  This is from Reuters.
[00:12:33.014 --> 00:12:34.675]  North Korea ready to teach U.S.
[00:12:34.675 --> 00:12:36.736]  a severe lesson with nuclear weapons.
[00:12:38.832 --> 00:12:41.073]  And of course they're criticizing the U.N.
[00:12:41.073 --> 00:12:43.373]  abused its authority.
[00:12:43.373 --> 00:12:45.374]  Because finally even the U.N.
[00:12:45.374 --> 00:12:50.355]  and China are saying that North Korea is out of control.
[00:12:50.355 --> 00:12:55.216]  Because Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un's father, was under China's control.
[00:12:55.216 --> 00:13:00.738]  Kim Jong-un, to a great extent, is not under their control and is out of his mind.
[00:13:02.298 --> 00:13:07.081]  And the clock is ticking on President Trump and the world having to do something about it.
[00:13:07.081 --> 00:13:21.331]  And it sits fairly and squarely at the feet of the Clintons and the globalists and the ideology of communism visited upon the planet by US and British and German intellectuals in the last 150 years.
[00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:26.732]  Revenge will be thousandfold.
[00:13:26.732 --> 00:13:36.498]  North Korea vows to attack America, as Kim Jong-un demands justice for Donald Trump, trying to isolate and stifle his country.
[00:13:36.498 --> 00:13:40.500]  Boy, you talk about projection.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:47.944]  Isolating, stifling your country under Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist malice oppression?
[00:13:47.944 --> 00:13:50.145]  Where you grow fat off the blood of your people?
[00:13:50.145 --> 00:13:52.627]  And they're taught that you're a god?
[00:13:55.834 --> 00:14:11.828]  And we have the bizarrest, absurdest vision of you hobbling around with your childhood idol, Dennis Rodman?
[00:14:11.828 --> 00:14:13.209]  Incredible!
[00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:15.230]  But that's the cult of big government!
[00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.852]  That's what they want!
[00:14:16.852 --> 00:14:19.354]  It's what they're pushing!
[00:14:19.354 --> 00:14:23.838]  And it's where all forms of centralization lead, pure, unadulterated,
[00:14:24.884 --> 00:14:33.631]  Authoritarianism with a spoiled, rotten elite on top and a giant, unwashed, dumbed-down, enslaved mass on the bottom.
[00:14:33.631 --> 00:14:36.013]  And that's what we're fighting existentially.
[00:14:36.013 --> 00:14:51.025]  Now, before I get into all the ultra-massive news today, obviously, thematically, you've got former Reagan administration officials, former Clinton administration officials, former CIA directors, former directors of national intelligence.
[00:14:51.025 --> 00:14:53.087]  You've got all the big cheeses.
[00:14:55.208 --> 00:15:17.704]  In the news, it's up on Infowars.com, a Paul Joseph Watson article, and they are saying that the preparations to remove President Trump in the near future are underway.
[00:15:17.704 --> 00:15:21.466]  There's the headline, ex-Reagan official, Trump should be gone by February.
[00:15:21.466 --> 00:15:23.668]  The swamp will make mincemeat of him.
[00:15:26.275 --> 00:15:35.717]  Now, that said, I have been publicly begging the President to launch his own media operation to have fireside chats.
[00:15:35.717 --> 00:15:44.799]  They have done something along those lines with the announcement of Real News, a once-a-week, hour-long program.
[00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:47.119]  It's going to start 30 minutes, move to an hour.
[00:15:47.119 --> 00:15:49.620]  They've hired a former CNN reporter.
[00:15:51.772 --> 00:15:55.995]  Basically a teleprompter reader to read and break down the clips.
[00:15:55.995 --> 00:16:07.804]  And guaranteed with his 60-something million followers on Twitter alone, under his two accounts, and you count the rest of his family, 80 million.
[00:16:07.804 --> 00:16:12.588]  If they don't stifle and block it, it will have the most views of anything in the world.
[00:16:12.588 --> 00:16:18.972]  I mean, already when Trump puts out videos and puts out speeches, they get seen tens of millions of times outside of mainstream media.
[00:16:18.972 --> 00:16:21.014]  And of course, CNN panicked.
[00:16:23.032 --> 00:16:27.635]  Presidents could have fireside chats with Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
[00:16:27.635 --> 00:16:32.398]  They could have weekly radio addresses, but they're saying this is state-run media, this is pure evil.
[00:16:32.398 --> 00:16:45.547]  No, state-run media is the CIA-established State Department office under Obama that's still operating, trying to stop independent media in America, and the media demonizing Rex Tillerson because he's not letting them spend the money.
[00:16:46.207 --> 00:16:49.609]  Or letting the FCC come in and try to shut down Free Press.
[00:16:49.609 --> 00:17:08.282]  I mean, they're in the news with a straight face saying, shut down the independent Free Press, and now they are going into hysterical gesticulations and flip-flopping and gnashing of teeth and running around like the proverbial chicken with the head lopped off.
[00:17:08.282 --> 00:17:11.004]  Stories up on InfoWars.com.
[00:17:11.004 --> 00:17:13.106]  We've got the announcement
[00:17:14.124 --> 00:17:20.686]  And then we've got all of the freaking out, but here is Trump launches the real news broadcast.
[00:17:20.686 --> 00:17:23.406]  I'm going to play that clip, but just think about this.
[00:17:23.406 --> 00:17:31.129]  This is only a program once a week to actually show the real accomplishments and then interface with the public.
[00:17:31.129 --> 00:17:34.129]  I mean, Obama had massive teams putting out his own propaganda.
[00:17:34.129 --> 00:17:36.350]  The difference was no one wanted to watch it.
[00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:40.705]  And so the president more and more is isolated.
[00:17:40.705 --> 00:17:44.730]  Fox News is clearly showing its colors right now, except for Sean Hannity, basically.
[00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:50.596]  And this is the right move, but it needs to be more than this.
[00:17:50.596 --> 00:17:52.999]  And this is what Scaramucci wanted to do.
[00:17:52.999 --> 00:17:55.021]  This is why the power structure feared him so much.
[00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:58.785]  But this is Scaramucci's plan going into function.
[00:18:01.135 --> 00:18:09.517]  But we need Trump every week addressing people point blank with a stack of news articles, holding them up, going through the lies.
[00:18:09.517 --> 00:18:14.438]  When they say he hasn't accomplished anything, go through what he's accomplished.
[00:18:14.438 --> 00:18:15.099]  Things like that.
[00:18:15.099 --> 00:18:21.700]  When they say that, you know, they're trying to cheerlead the fall of the economy, he needs to be there exposing who did it.
[00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.721]  Those are the big issues.
[00:18:23.721 --> 00:18:25.001]  But this is the right direction.
[00:18:25.001 --> 00:18:26.361]  This is a really great move.
[00:18:26.361 --> 00:18:28.582]  Here it is, Trump launches real news broadcasts.
[00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.172]  Hey everybody, I'm Kayleigh McEnany.
[00:18:32.172 --> 00:18:36.498]  Thank you for joining us as we provide you the news of the week from Trump Tower here in New York.
[00:18:37.481 --> 00:18:39.322]  More great economic news on Friday.
[00:18:39.322 --> 00:18:44.684]  The July jobs report added a better-than-expected 209,000 jobs.
[00:18:44.684 --> 00:18:50.226]  Overall, since the president took office, President Trump has created more than 1 million jobs.
[00:18:50.226 --> 00:18:56.068]  The unemployment rate is at a 16-year low, and consumer confidence is at a 16-year high.
[00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:58.949]  All while the Dow Jones continues to break records.
[00:18:58.949 --> 00:19:02.451]  President Trump has clearly steered the economy back in the right direction.
[00:19:03.491 --> 00:19:06.555]  On Wednesday, the President introduced the RAISE Act.
[00:19:06.555 --> 00:19:11.921]  For decades, a steady rise in immigration has depressed the wages of American workers.
[00:19:11.921 --> 00:19:18.068]  The RAISE Act will increase wages, decrease poverty, and save the taxpayers billions.
[00:19:18.068 --> 00:19:22.814]  Americans deserve a raise, and President Trump is finally putting the American worker first.
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:30.864]  Also on Wednesday, President Trump awarded the Medal of Honor to one of our Vietnam War heroes, Specialist 5 James McCloughan.
[00:19:30.864 --> 00:19:35.687]  McCloughan risked his life on nine separate occasions, saving many of his wounded peers.
[00:19:35.687 --> 00:19:43.991]  President Trump also honored veterans as a whole with yet another VA reform package that will enable millions of veterans to receive better access to care.
[00:19:43.991 --> 00:19:50.775]  President Trump is dedicated to honoring these men and women who fought valiantly for our country and ensuring that they receive the care that they deserve.
[00:19:51.375 --> 00:19:52.776]  Thank you for joining us everybody.
[00:19:52.776 --> 00:19:55.257]  I'm Kayleigh McEnany and that is The Real News.
[00:19:55.257 --> 00:20:05.462]  This is just the embryonic kickoff but it's got CNN, MSNBC having convulsions because the fake news can't believe that Trump's gonna have his own voice.
[00:20:07.045 --> 00:20:12.147]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:20:12.147 --> 00:20:17.849]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.

[00:20:28.334 --> 00:20:31.615]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.

[00:20:43.486 --> 00:20:46.328]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[00:20:59.917 --> 00:21:01.839]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[00:24:17.093 --> 00:24:19.015]  We've got a bunch of guests joining us today.
[00:24:19.015 --> 00:24:26.979]  A ton of mainstream announcements that they have a plan to forcibly outside the Constitution remove President Trump.
[00:24:26.979 --> 00:24:28.620]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:29.901]  The latest on North Korea.
[00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:32.823]  The latest on what's happening with the economy.
[00:24:32.823 --> 00:24:33.844]  The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:24:33.844 --> 00:24:35.985]  It's all coming up.
[00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:46.717]  But getting back into Trump launching the embryonic beginnings of a weekly news program that simply looks at the accomplishments.
[00:24:46.717 --> 00:24:49.740]  Now, why is this so important?
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:56.685]  With his two different Twitter accounts, way over 60 million followers, they're now blocking his Twitter account.
[00:24:56.685 --> 00:25:00.088]  They're now auto-disliking it, even when you click that you like it.
[00:25:00.088 --> 00:25:04.972]  Kind of like a voting machine when you vote for a libertarian or conservative and it makes you vote for the Democrat.
[00:25:05.865 --> 00:25:09.426]  Like happened in so many states where you try to vote for Trump and it would go vote for Hillary.
[00:25:09.426 --> 00:25:12.707]  Or you tried to vote for Sanders and it would vote for Hillary.
[00:25:12.707 --> 00:25:18.749]  Or the nominees would give her the nomination, but then they just ignored that and had the superdelegates take it away.
[00:25:18.749 --> 00:25:21.509]  It's the same deal.
[00:25:21.509 --> 00:25:26.451]  You're hitting A, they're giving you B. You go left, they go right.
[00:25:26.451 --> 00:25:29.152]  You go up, they go down.
[00:25:29.152 --> 00:25:30.332]  You go high, they go lower.
[00:25:33.522 --> 00:25:51.769]  So, breaking Twitter censors, Eric Trump's tweet of the Drudge Report that simply sent out the federal government's own Congressional Budget Office numbers on the economy roaring back last Friday.
[00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:53.390]  And it said this tweet is not available.
[00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:56.071]  Then we got screenshots of what it was.
[00:25:56.071 --> 00:25:58.752]  It was a link to the Drudge Report.
[00:25:58.752 --> 00:26:00.752]  And they said this is not acceptable.
[00:26:00.752 --> 00:26:01.493]  This is sensitive.
[00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.291]  This is in the hate area.
[00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:27.538]  So, the great crime now is that Trump would have an info babe read off a few of the accomplishments and point out when you open your country up to unfettered third world population drive, you will lower your standards, you will lower your overall wages and what the wages can buy.
[00:26:27.538 --> 00:26:30.119]  And we're going with the model of Australia and Canada that have
[00:26:31.098 --> 00:26:38.684]  Open borders but to skilled workers or to students and people that don't have medical issues.
[00:26:38.684 --> 00:26:42.187]  You know, people that contribute to your country.
[00:26:42.187 --> 00:26:47.391]  But see, oh no, you've got to take that and turn it upside down like it's some great evil.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:54.651]  So let's go to CNN first flipping out over Trump's Real News broadcast.
[00:26:54.651 --> 00:27:00.300]  How dare him have his own video he puts out that they're going to have more trouble censoring.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.142]  They're so scared.
[00:27:02.657 --> 00:27:07.640]  There's also this new development just in the past hour or so that I want to show all of you.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:14.384]  Kayleigh McEnany, who wasn't until recently a CNN commentator, seems to have joined the Trump re-election campaign.
[00:27:14.384 --> 00:27:20.308]  She's in a new video on Trump's Facebook page this morning presenting what looks a lot like a newscast.
[00:27:20.308 --> 00:27:24.190]  Let's watch and then discuss.
[00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:25.891]  Hey everybody, I'm Kayleigh McEnany.
[00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:30.214]  Thank you for joining us as we provide you the news of the week from Trump Tower here in New York.
[00:27:31.164 --> 00:27:33.025]  More great economic news on Friday.
[00:27:33.025 --> 00:27:35.946]  The July jobs report added a better than expected 209,000 jobs.
[00:27:43.319 --> 00:27:44.119]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[00:27:44.119 --> 00:28:07.254]  Notice he said, looks like a newscast, has the graphics of a newscast, and we've got to use that clip every time now when CNN gets caught in a bunch of lies, and just put it all together, showing CNN caught in another lie, CNN caught in another retraction, CNN caught staging the debate, CNN caught giving the questions to Donna Brazile, CNN caught with fake polls, CNN caught faking location.
[00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:29.189]  CNN caught, CNN caught, CNN caught, CNN caught, and then just keep cutting back to Super Mr. Potato Head, excuse me, I meant Humpty Dumpty, sitting up there, Baby Hippo, whatever his name is, saying, looks like a real newscast, the graphics, but is it?
[00:28:29.189 --> 00:28:33.832]  Cutting into those job numbers, because they don't want you to get those job numbers.
[00:28:33.832 --> 00:28:38.036]  They want to show you, her giving you a little bit of them, and then imply it's fake.
[00:28:40.345 --> 00:28:42.406]  Is the $4 trillion in the stock market fake too?
[00:28:42.406 --> 00:28:46.187]  Or the 69% in illegals coming across down?
[00:28:46.187 --> 00:28:49.208]  Or ISIS basically defeated?
[00:28:49.208 --> 00:28:55.850]  Or the Second Amendment now not as great an attack?
[00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:57.431]  Let's finish up with Super Mr. Potato Head.
[00:28:58.407 --> 00:29:06.410]  ...like a newscast, has the graphical appearance, sounds like a newscast, but obviously, Jeff Greenfield, it's a promotional effort... Pause again.
[00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:08.191]  Obviously it's a promotional effort.
[00:29:08.191 --> 00:29:09.652]  What are you a promotional effort for?
[00:29:09.652 --> 00:29:10.792]  Globalism!
[00:29:10.792 --> 00:29:12.653]  The special interest that have hijacked this country.
[00:29:12.653 --> 00:29:13.613]  Back it up.
[00:29:13.613 --> 00:29:22.577]  Let's play the three people, looks like a newscast, sounds like a newscast, but everybody knows you are the name in anti-American, anti-truth news.
[00:29:22.577 --> 00:29:25.958]  CNN is the gold standard of baloney.
[00:29:25.958 --> 00:29:27.399]  Let's finish up with fake news CNN.
[00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:38.120]  ...like a newscast, has the graphical appearance, sounds like a newscast, but obviously, Jeff Greenfield, it's a promotional effort either for the Trump re-election campaign or the Republican National Committee.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:38.921]  What do you make of it?
[00:29:38.921 --> 00:29:39.562]  Not much.
[00:29:39.562 --> 00:29:42.485]  I mean, look at what's behind her.
[00:29:42.485 --> 00:29:47.009]  Campaigns have been trying to do news-like videos ever since there was videos.
[00:29:47.009 --> 00:29:51.594]  In the scheme of things, that doesn't strike me as a particularly bothersome problem.
[00:29:51.874 --> 00:29:53.878]  But the president's railed against fake news.
[00:29:53.878 --> 00:29:55.481]  Isn't this a sign that he... We'll be right back.
[00:29:55.481 --> 00:29:57.305]  It's more than acting confident.
[00:29:57.305 --> 00:29:58.227]  Oh, we're number one.
[00:29:58.227 --> 00:30:00.371]  Everybody hates us, but we're number one.
[00:30:00.371 --> 00:30:01.093]  We'll be back, folks.
[00:30:08.382 --> 00:30:12.145]  What exactly is political correctness, and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[00:30:12.145 --> 00:30:18.329]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion.
[00:30:18.329 --> 00:30:27.275]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in a ripple effect.
[00:30:27.515 --> 00:30:29.937]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[00:30:29.937 --> 00:30:33.781]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple.
[00:30:33.781 --> 00:30:37.485]  And over time, we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[00:30:37.485 --> 00:30:40.868]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[00:30:40.868 --> 00:30:49.436]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth.
[00:30:49.436 --> 00:30:50.898]  Such as global warming, for example.
[00:30:51.098 --> 00:31:00.261]  Then the establishment suppresses any counter-arguments through their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs, racists, or, in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[00:31:00.261 --> 00:31:06.763]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and our YouTube channel, Resistance News.

[00:31:38.106 --> 00:31:46.828]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[00:31:46.828 --> 00:31:56.430]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:59.870]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.

[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:28.989]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:33:31.087 --> 00:33:34.830]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:38.453]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[00:33:38.453 --> 00:33:40.635]  It's a military mission in North St.
[00:33:40.635 --> 00:33:41.276]  Louis.
[00:33:41.276 --> 00:33:43.858]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[00:33:43.858 --> 00:33:48.522]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[00:33:48.522 --> 00:33:53.306]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[00:33:53.306 --> 00:33:54.207]  Guns will be taken.
[00:33:54.207 --> 00:33:55.688]  No one will be able to be armed.
[00:33:55.688 --> 00:33:56.689]  We will take all weapons.
[00:33:56.869 --> 00:33:59.250]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:03.833]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:04.673]  Enough.
[00:34:04.673 --> 00:34:05.474]  Enough.
[00:34:05.474 --> 00:34:06.534]  Enough.
[00:34:06.534 --> 00:34:06.914]  Enough.
[00:34:06.914 --> 00:34:11.477]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[00:34:11.477 --> 00:34:15.419]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:23.004]  NSJS Late News 12's Jeff Bell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[00:34:23.004 --> 00:34:31.030]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.653]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:34:34.653 --> 00:34:36.234]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:34:37.077 --> 00:34:43.363]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:34:43.363 --> 00:34:48.327]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[00:34:48.327 --> 00:34:52.991]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[00:35:00.754 --> 00:35:06.176]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[00:35:06.176 --> 00:35:07.396]  In your apartment!
[00:35:07.396 --> 00:35:08.517]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[00:35:08.517 --> 00:35:09.737]  The mic is on right now!
[00:35:09.737 --> 00:35:10.777]  I am inside.
[00:35:10.777 --> 00:35:12.678]  I have two words for you.
[00:35:12.678 --> 00:35:14.499]  Predator groans.
[00:35:14.499 --> 00:35:15.499]  You will never see it coming.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.402]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[00:35:22.402 --> 00:35:31.646]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[00:35:31.646 --> 00:35:37.109]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:42.172]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[00:35:42.172 --> 00:35:44.213]  If you want them, come and take them!
[00:35:45.976 --> 00:35:47.679]  We are on the march.
[00:35:47.679 --> 00:35:50.525]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:35:50.525 --> 00:35:55.053]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:36:10.078 --> 00:36:15.343]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[00:36:15.343 --> 00:36:23.371]  This is the heart of 1776!
[00:36:23.371 --> 00:36:31.799]  But this is where the work of Robert Mueller is critical to our future as a country because I, you know, in some respects we're a government and a nation in crisis right now.
[00:36:32.901 --> 00:36:35.363]  You have confidence in this special counsel?
[00:36:35.363 --> 00:36:36.444]  Absolutely.
[00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:38.785]  You both worked with him for a long time when he was head of the FBI.
[00:36:38.785 --> 00:36:39.226]  Absolutely.
[00:36:39.226 --> 00:36:41.387]  It was an inspired choice.
[00:36:41.387 --> 00:36:43.149]  They don't come any better.
[00:36:43.149 --> 00:36:48.973]  Nobody better than Bob Mueller, who is a straight shooter and will not be intimidated by anything.
[00:36:48.973 --> 00:36:57.540]  And if he's fired by Mr. Trump, or attempted to be fired by Mr. Trump, I hope, I really hope that our members of Congress, our elected representatives, are going to stand up and say enough is enough.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:05.488]  And stop making apologies and excuses for things that are happening that really flout, I think, our system of laws and government here.
[00:37:05.488 --> 00:37:18.363]  When you say enough is enough, if he's fired, and he's the President of the United States, he could tell Rosenstein to fire him if he wants, but if he's fired, what would you want Congress to do?
[00:37:19.688 --> 00:37:29.436]  First of all, I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse to carry out some of these orders that, again, are inconsistent with what this country is all about.
[00:37:29.436 --> 00:37:35.741]  But I would just hope that this is not going to be a partisan issue.
[00:37:35.741 --> 00:37:42.847]  That Republicans and Democrats are going to see that the future of this country is at stake, and there needs to be some things done for the good of the future.
[00:37:44.113 --> 00:37:52.318]  Now that's Brennan who converted to Islam, and he's up there with Clapper, who lied to Congress and said the NSA doesn't spy on the American people.
[00:37:52.318 --> 00:38:00.002]  These are the folks with Mueller that took Islam off the list, radical Islam, off the list of terror groups when it's 99% of the terror.
[00:38:00.002 --> 00:38:09.227]  I mean, these are the people that protected the Clintons through their rampage of criminal activity, through the out-of-control orgy of
[00:38:10.626 --> 00:38:16.010]  Looting and other felony type behavior by Obama.
[00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:25.936]  The funding of the Muslim Brotherhood, the funding of the overthrow of our allies, the complete opening of our borders, letting criminals flood in, killing all vetting.
[00:38:25.936 --> 00:38:28.738]  It just goes on and on, the crimes these people have committed.
[00:38:28.738 --> 00:38:40.065]  And then they sit up there and point their finger at Trump with Mueller, who now doesn't have any Russia evidence, so he is expanding
[00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:54.167]  To the friends, the family, the neighbors, the renters, everybody on the campaign looking for perjury, looking for money laundering, looking for somebody that embezzled $1,000.
[00:38:57.082 --> 00:39:00.703]  It's the exact same thing that's happening with Benjamin Netanyahu right now.
[00:39:00.703 --> 00:39:18.951]  Whether you love Benjamin Netanyahu or hate Benjamin Netanyahu, I always notice that a big segment of the right wing hated Netanyahu and put Israel in one big monolithic group and made it a touchstone or a sacrament to say Netanyahu ran everything.
[00:39:18.951 --> 00:39:21.652]  Well, the big Rothschild liberal globalist
[00:39:22.876 --> 00:39:28.600]  Soros Combine that we know from the WikiLeaks wants to destroy Israel and that is allied with Islam.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.663]  Because they got more money and more people.
[00:39:31.663 --> 00:39:34.885]  Because of the oil.
[00:39:34.885 --> 00:39:42.091]  They are trying to get rid of Netanyahu in the same thing they've done with special prosecutors and special investigators for years.
[00:39:42.091 --> 00:39:47.735]  And they finally got one of his deputies to plead guilty to some shady business dealings that are very moderate.
[00:39:50.223 --> 00:39:55.544]  And this guy, I went and actually researched it.
[00:39:55.544 --> 00:39:59.805]  This Israeli saying, you know, none of this has anything to do with Netanyahu.
[00:39:59.805 --> 00:40:04.146]  But the news here and in Israel is saying, oh, it's over for Netanyahu.
[00:40:04.146 --> 00:40:12.087]  His chief aide, former aide, has pled guilty for a light sentence, just probation and a fine for things he's done.
[00:40:12.087 --> 00:40:13.628]  But then you actually go read the guy's statement.
[00:40:13.628 --> 00:40:15.468]  He said, I'm doing this because
[00:40:17.475 --> 00:40:21.637]  They gave me clemency, but it has nothing to do with Netanyahu.
[00:40:21.637 --> 00:40:29.901]  But you have to actually go find his statement from his lawyer and his statement, because if you read the news, you won't see that.
[00:40:29.901 --> 00:40:38.666]  Unless you look at Jerusalem Online, Ari Haro says he's not trying to put the blame on Netanyahu.
[00:40:38.666 --> 00:40:45.189]  And they say, somebody might have given Netanyahu's wife a present ten years ago, or
[00:40:47.455 --> 00:40:51.237]  I mean, it is the most ridiculous stuff you've ever heard of.
[00:40:51.237 --> 00:41:08.326]  You've got the Clintons and Obama and the Clinton Foundation, all these groups just engaged in, you know, 12 million here, 8 million there, 9 million here, 2 million there, from foreign governments to openly change policy within 24 hours.
[00:41:11.212 --> 00:41:13.033]  Of Hillary getting the money.
[00:41:13.033 --> 00:41:14.755]  And it's even in the WikiLeaks!
[00:41:14.755 --> 00:41:23.401]  Okay, you gave three million dollars, we'll get that meeting for you next week with Hillary to change those regulations for you.
[00:41:23.401 --> 00:41:24.642]  Oh, there's an arms embargo?
[00:41:24.642 --> 00:41:28.425]  Don't worry, the State Department will give you a special license to get around that.
[00:41:28.425 --> 00:41:30.627]  I mean, it's crazy!
[00:41:30.627 --> 00:41:32.448]  It's so cut and dry.
[00:41:32.448 --> 00:41:34.350]  It's what they call open and shut.
[00:41:36.072 --> 00:41:40.475]  It'd be like if you committed a crime at the Super Bowl on the main stage.
[00:41:40.475 --> 00:41:49.981]  If you committed a murder on the Jumbotron in front of 90 million viewers, you pull a gun out, you shoot somebody, it's you, open and shut, done.
[00:41:49.981 --> 00:41:52.183]  It's the same thing with the Clintons.
[00:41:52.183 --> 00:41:55.545]  Then meanwhile, it's the same thing with this whole Netanyahu thing.
[00:41:55.545 --> 00:41:56.666]  There's nothing there.
[00:41:56.666 --> 00:41:59.668]  I don't have a dog in the fight for Netanyahu.
[00:41:59.668 --> 00:42:00.689]  I just go look at the facts.
[00:42:02.182 --> 00:42:04.103]  And there's nothing there!
[00:42:04.103 --> 00:42:07.444]  And they're saying, oh, he's going to be indicted any minute.
[00:42:07.444 --> 00:42:24.171]  But, because he's the Prime Minister, they have similar parliamentary systems that we have, so one branch doesn't overthrow the other, that he won't even have to step down because of the fact that it's a separate branch of government, but that he won't survive the shame of it.
[00:42:26.357 --> 00:42:28.058]  And it's the same thing with Trump.
[00:42:28.058 --> 00:42:44.172]  That's all they're doing is saying, his base has deserted him, no one supports him, he's down in the polls, you're a loser if you support him, the economy's bad, he doesn't have his base anymore, go back to sleep, on and on and on.
[00:42:44.172 --> 00:42:45.994]  And then you actually look at what Trump's doing.
[00:42:52.315 --> 00:43:01.682]  Turning the economy on, making companies do bids, fixing the VA, controlling the border, just all basic life support you do for a country.
[00:43:01.682 --> 00:43:08.527]  All he's doing is the default settings we had until the early 60s that made us prosperous.
[00:43:08.527 --> 00:43:13.210]  Just default stuff.
[00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:21.296]  But the mainstream media is running the hoax everywhere that Trump's base is deserting him and they put out more fake polls.
[00:43:23.885 --> 00:43:26.647]  And they take everything he does and try to make it look horrible.
[00:43:26.647 --> 00:43:29.268]  And why do I back Trump so hard?
[00:43:29.268 --> 00:43:41.795]  Because did you think it'd be easy to take Washington back and to cut taxes and repeal Obamacare and to get out of TPP and to kick the IMF and World Bank out of our government and to get out of the carbon taxes that only the West had to pay?
[00:43:41.795 --> 00:43:43.196]  Do you think it would be easy?
[00:43:43.196 --> 00:43:44.116]  It's going to be hard.
[00:43:44.116 --> 00:43:45.177]  They're going to fight back.
[00:43:45.177 --> 00:43:50.280]  And I can't believe how much he's gotten done in six months and three weeks.
[00:43:52.432 --> 00:44:05.781]  I can't believe how we've gone from hell to heaven, comparatively, and that I can't believe how instant gratification has diseased this nation, even some conservatives I know who never really backed Trump.
[00:44:07.403 --> 00:44:13.625]  But held their nose, they're kind of like, well, yeah, he's a little out of control and needs to stop tweeting and needs to get disciplined.
[00:44:13.625 --> 00:44:17.366]  And they buy into this thing like they're his mommy and they're his daddy.
[00:44:17.366 --> 00:44:20.587]  And yeah, we don't like Hillary, but she's gone now.
[00:44:20.587 --> 00:44:31.110]  So we just want to feel authoritative and feel powerful and feel like, you know, we're up here, critical of Trump kind of hedging our bets.
[00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:32.871]  Just hedging your bets intellectually.
[00:44:33.848 --> 00:44:44.393]  Let me explain something to you and the Blue Blood Republicans and all the rest of them.
[00:44:44.393 --> 00:44:52.498]  The globalists know there has been a total revolutionary awakening to their program.
[00:44:52.498 --> 00:44:56.620]  And they know that the people of the world are awake to them and upset about what they're doing.
[00:44:57.614 --> 00:45:10.063]  And they know now they can't act like we're still in a free society and leave those systems open or they're going to completely be economically, culturally, you name it, overthrown peacefully.
[00:45:10.063 --> 00:45:15.146]  So they've got to start a fight, start a civil emergency, start a group of crises.
[00:45:15.146 --> 00:45:21.711]  They've got to accelerate societal breakdown and then bring in authoritarian control as a supposed answer to that.
[00:45:23.171 --> 00:45:24.533]  And it's in their white papers.
[00:45:24.533 --> 00:45:30.439]  Bring in radical Islam, bring in 80% military age men, bring in 10 million of them into Europe alone.
[00:45:30.439 --> 00:45:32.422]  Keep the numbers secret until it's too late.
[00:45:32.422 --> 00:45:34.003]  Now they admit 10 million.
[00:45:34.003 --> 00:45:35.465]  I thought it was 5 million.
[00:45:35.465 --> 00:45:37.127]  10 million in the last 5 years.
[00:45:37.127 --> 00:45:42.553]  And then tell everybody, you don't have free speech anymore, you've got to comply and comport with Islam.
[00:45:43.314 --> 00:45:49.220]  They're banning synagogues, new ones being built, churches being built in some areas of Europe, Australia.
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:54.345]  They're banning pork being served in at least seven European countries in their school lunch programs.
[00:45:54.345 --> 00:45:58.369]  Because it, quote, upsets the Muslims.
[00:45:58.369 --> 00:45:59.811]  The sky is the limit.
[00:45:59.811 --> 00:46:04.956]  They're just using an outside Stone Age authoritarian cult.
[00:46:09.793 --> 00:46:16.520]  To make everyone then comport with that, because if you'll comport with that, if you'll put up with that, you'll put up with anything.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.102]  What do you think the tranny stuff's about?
[00:46:19.284 --> 00:46:22.125]  First, it's, oh, be nice to gay people in the military.
[00:46:22.125 --> 00:46:23.406]  Don't be mean to them.
[00:46:23.406 --> 00:46:24.746]  Sounds reasonable.
[00:46:24.746 --> 00:46:25.526]  Now, boom!
[00:46:25.526 --> 00:46:26.647]  It's trannies!
[00:46:26.647 --> 00:46:38.231]  And let's teach sex changes and give it to anybody you want in the military and turn it into a giant factory of confusion that will sabotage human operations of the military, ahead of the robots replacing everybody, which is all admitted.
[00:46:38.231 --> 00:46:43.953]  And then when you accept the trannies and the sex changes, well, you'll accept the brain chips and everything else, which they're now admitting.
[00:46:43.953 --> 00:46:47.215]  They simply set a new goalpost that sounds incredibly radical
[00:46:47.995 --> 00:47:06.333]  So that you'll accept everything else they were already pushing behind that, and then they can persecute the military and persecute one of the only human cultures left, the male culture of war and defense, and so they can go in and social engineer and take control of that!
[00:47:07.498 --> 00:47:20.005]  While they steal from the public all of our basic rights, they give you the right to be transmutagenic, to end your humanity, because that's the biological revolution.
[00:47:20.005 --> 00:47:23.247]  That ties together with this report I have here.
[00:47:23.247 --> 00:47:25.909]  Fido and Fluffy are ruining the environment.
[00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:33.333]  UCLA study says, they say, euthanize your pet, euthanize your dog, euthanize your kitty.
[00:47:33.333 --> 00:47:34.254]  Well, why is that?
[00:47:35.435 --> 00:47:40.769]  Peter Singer is the spiritual and cultural leader of PETA.
[00:47:40.769 --> 00:47:43.236]  PETA is admittedly a transhumanist cult.
[00:47:44.175 --> 00:48:02.023]  that wants to speak for animal rights so they can leverage out the voting rights of human as a lobby and speak for the animals but they don't actually care for the animals and in their teaching they want domesticated animals to be illegal from parrots to dogs to cats and want to make you euthanize them.
[00:48:02.023 --> 00:48:10.667]  Now that's only done so that you will then accept when the government says we're going to tax you like communist China does for having a dog or a cat.
[00:48:12.432 --> 00:48:14.153]  Because you owe an allegiance to it.
[00:48:14.153 --> 00:48:22.335]  It gives you some normal humanity, even though it's an animal, it psychologically, it culturally, it spiritually raises your consciousness.
[00:48:22.335 --> 00:48:40.122]  They've got computer graphs that show this from the television, from everything, because the animals haven't been completely programmed yet, though Google and Samsung and others are trying to with the TVs, so that it's actually buoying you to even be around a dog or a cat and helping trigger your own humanity.
[00:48:40.962 --> 00:48:52.746]  Just like they want you out of the forest, out of the hills, out of the water, out of the fields, away from the horses, just to even have animals in your house, birds tweeting, sun shining, you're not looking at a TV.
[00:48:52.746 --> 00:48:54.287]  This is all declassified.
[00:48:54.287 --> 00:48:57.128]  Ugly architecture, ugly literature, all declassified.
[00:48:57.128 --> 00:49:04.871]  They funded PETA and other groups so that they can then make it guiltful and bad to even have a dog or a cat.
[00:49:07.472 --> 00:49:16.318]  So you'll then pay a carbon tax, and they say, oh, your dog has a big carbon footprint, and your cat, so we need you to go ahead and kill him.
[00:49:16.318 --> 00:49:18.700]  David Knight shot a big report on it.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.561]  I tweeted it out at Real Alex Jones.
[00:49:20.561 --> 00:49:23.823]  California crazies, kill your pet, not just your car.
[00:49:23.823 --> 00:49:26.765]  An interesting headline, but none of this is crazy.
[00:49:26.765 --> 00:49:28.486]  This is all done 100% by design.
[00:49:28.486 --> 00:49:29.147]  This is all done 100%
[00:49:36.587 --> 00:49:53.196]  In their own words, to absolutely dehumanize you and remove you from any environment that has any vestigial, cultural, ancestral memory basis.
[00:49:53.196 --> 00:50:00.240]  It is a full assault, not just on you, but on every plant, every animal, every ecosystem.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.301]  Everything's being overwritten.
[00:50:02.301 --> 00:50:04.162]  Everything's being destroyed by design.
[00:50:05.615 --> 00:50:23.082]  And then the people that are doing it claim they represent the environmental movement and are going to tax carbon dioxide because they know you know sunlight's good, they know you know oxygen's good, they know you know water's good, but the fourth element of the carbon cycle is carbon dioxide.
[00:50:23.082 --> 00:50:26.783]  You cannot have life on this planet, third rock out, without it.
[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:37.481]  So they're just beginning to say, we need you to eat less meat.
[00:50:37.481 --> 00:50:40.662]  We need you to have lower carbon footprint.
[00:50:40.662 --> 00:50:48.103]  But if you go to PETA, who's been caught doing it, they go to the pound and get dogs and cats and then euthanize them.
[00:50:48.103 --> 00:50:51.604]  I was the first to break that 16 years ago.
[00:50:51.604 --> 00:50:53.985]  They go, then they got caught, remember?
[00:50:53.985 --> 00:50:55.765]  Throwing hundreds of dead animals into a dumpster.
[00:50:55.765 --> 00:50:59.906]  They go and have their members get them and then they themselves kill them.
[00:51:02.915 --> 00:51:04.355]  And people ask, well, why do they do it?
[00:51:04.355 --> 00:51:08.917]  Because it's just a sick cult.
[00:51:08.917 --> 00:51:11.378]  Behind closed doors, it's completely insane.
[00:51:11.378 --> 00:51:13.479]  Hamburgers, steak dinners, you name it.
[00:51:13.479 --> 00:51:14.859]  It's all a sick joke.
[00:51:14.859 --> 00:51:27.283]  But you have to understand, it's all compartmentalized mental illness by design to teach you to accept total authoritarianism.
[00:51:27.283 --> 00:51:32.245]  I mean, imagine just five years ago, hey, we're going to make the military have crannies.
[00:51:34.929 --> 00:51:37.570]  And then we're going to make the military pay for sex changes.
[00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:38.851]  You'd say that's crazy.
[00:51:38.851 --> 00:51:40.891]  Now, it's just, oh, it's given.
[00:51:40.891 --> 00:51:42.832]  You're not hateful, are you?
[00:51:42.832 --> 00:51:51.656]  And then it's given that at colleges and high schools, they're saying, oh, we're going to let men and women self-identify and compete on each other's teams.
[00:51:53.277 --> 00:52:04.741]  And so now in the Olympics, this year, they announced as policy what had already been unofficial policy for the last three summer and winter Olympics.
[00:52:04.741 --> 00:52:07.602]  And that is that men can now compete.
[00:52:07.602 --> 00:52:10.263]  Of course, there's none vice versa.
[00:52:10.263 --> 00:52:11.964]  You don't see women competing with the men.
[00:52:11.964 --> 00:52:13.084]  It's about winning.
[00:52:13.084 --> 00:52:14.485]  It's about winning the gold medal.
[00:52:14.485 --> 00:52:17.146]  It's about people that are neurotic and want to cheat.
[00:52:17.146 --> 00:52:19.387]  And it's about men on average who are twice as strong.
[00:52:21.741 --> 00:52:28.425]  Men on average who are much, much quicker and faster, just genetically, like in any mammal species, the males are bigger.
[00:52:28.425 --> 00:52:30.747]  In some other species, the females are bigger.
[00:52:30.747 --> 00:52:36.631]  But in most bird species, the male is bigger and goes out and, you know, gets the food and brings it back and stuff.
[00:52:36.631 --> 00:52:41.034]  Because, you know, the female has the eggs, sits on them.
[00:52:41.034 --> 00:52:44.256]  It's in general species, females take care of the babies.
[00:52:45.558 --> 00:52:46.739]  The males go out, get the food.
[00:52:46.739 --> 00:52:47.960]  The males go out and get killed.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.521]  The males go out and go to war.
[00:52:49.521 --> 00:52:51.883]  It's the same thing in chimpanzees, you name it.
[00:52:51.883 --> 00:52:56.527]  They're literally turning all that on its head and then acting like I'm weird.
[00:52:56.527 --> 00:53:04.353]  When I look at a Daily Mail article with a headline, man gives birth, first man gives birth.
[00:53:04.353 --> 00:53:10.698]  And you look at it, it's a woman with a uterus and a vagina and they have a baby.
[00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:18.053]  It's all just mental illness by design to confuse culture and confuse your kids.
[00:53:18.053 --> 00:53:19.413]  Remember, it's totally cold-blooded.
[00:53:19.413 --> 00:53:23.917]  It's not even mental illness from the people at the top.
[00:53:23.917 --> 00:53:26.859]  They all know full well 100,000 times what they're doing.
[00:53:29.977 --> 00:53:30.577]  Don't believe me?
[00:53:30.577 --> 00:53:34.120]  Type in CIA planned transgender movement.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.020]  Type into search engines.
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:36.341]  You'll get mainstream news.
[00:53:36.341 --> 00:53:40.204]  CIA planned to push homosexuality to reduce population in family.
[00:53:40.204 --> 00:53:40.764]  Just Google.
[00:53:40.764 --> 00:53:46.648]  CIA had planned to have ugly squat architecture to crush human spirit.
[00:53:46.648 --> 00:53:51.791]  When you hear CIA, that just means the big foundations behind the CIA.
[00:53:51.791 --> 00:53:53.753]  Every single bit of it.
[00:53:55.410 --> 00:54:20.923]  Is about a war on reality, a war on common sense, a war on you to make you guilty for everything you do, where you can't have or do anything, where you feel so guilty as Obama and Hillary and Al Gore lecture you when one of Al Gore's houses has 33 times the carbon footprint of the average person, as if carbon's even bad.
[00:54:20.923 --> 00:54:24.125]  The toxic waste dumping, the genetic engineering, the nanotech,
[00:54:25.418 --> 00:54:27.200]  The pharmacological crops.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:27.720]  All of it.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:30.062]  Oh, that's not a problem.
[00:54:30.062 --> 00:54:31.463]  The geoengineering.
[00:54:31.463 --> 00:54:33.465]  That's not a problem.
[00:54:33.465 --> 00:54:36.047]  The AI.
[00:54:36.047 --> 00:54:38.409]  The destruction of free will.
[00:54:38.409 --> 00:54:39.330]  None of that's an issue.
[00:54:39.330 --> 00:54:41.272]  No, no, it's carbon.
[00:54:41.272 --> 00:54:45.115]  Carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:50.059]  And then it's Enron and Dutch Rochelle and BP are the main funders of the carbon tax for 30 years.
[00:54:51.377 --> 00:54:58.784]  But you get the environmentalists, cult members, saying, oh, you're funded by the oil companies because you're saying this is a scam.
[00:54:58.784 --> 00:55:04.610]  No, no, the oil companies created it.
[00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:09.194]  I'm sorry, I said 33 times, it's 34 times Al Gore's carbon footprint of one home.
[00:55:09.194 --> 00:55:10.996]  Excuse me, I'm sorry.
[00:55:10.996 --> 00:55:14.339]  But again, you can't have a car, you can't have air conditioning, they can't.
[00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:25.298]  It's the elites teaching you to be guilty from birth, that they've got everything and you've got nothing, and that it's cute and fun to be a loser.
[00:55:25.298 --> 00:55:34.345]  Now coming up the next hour, we've got compilations I haven't gotten to yet, with
[00:55:36.687 --> 00:55:44.474]  Folks that have been inside the Trump White House that have been fired by McMaster for pointing out the left's alliance with orthodox radical Islam.
[00:55:44.474 --> 00:55:46.856]  Rich Higgins and others.
[00:55:46.856 --> 00:55:58.487]  We're also going to have several guests joining us with breaking news from inside the White House and where this war to take down the President and kill our movement to restore the Republic is going.
[00:55:58.487 --> 00:55:59.408]  And so much more.
[00:55:59.408 --> 00:56:01.110]  So that is in the
[00:56:02.942 --> 00:56:03.642]  Second hour.
[00:56:03.642 --> 00:56:09.985]  Also, I saw this a few weeks ago and I knew where it was going and I meant to get on here and cover it and predict it.
[00:56:09.985 --> 00:56:13.086]  Trump doesn't want to pay three times what the Boeing aircraft are worth.
[00:56:13.086 --> 00:56:17.567]  Or, you know, what they're supposedly worth.
[00:56:17.567 --> 00:56:24.130]  And so he told the Air Force, refit some of our old aircraft, repair the ones, they got several Air Force Ones, repair these.
[00:56:25.287 --> 00:56:34.271]  The Air Force came up with a bankrupt Russian airline that bought two aircraft from Boeing but never flew them, that are just waiting to be received back to the U.S.
[00:56:34.271 --> 00:56:37.492]  And so now the Air Force says, sir, let's retrofit these.
[00:56:37.492 --> 00:56:39.753]  This will cost, you know, a tenth of the price.
[00:56:39.753 --> 00:56:42.974]  And they're now spinning it that he's buying aircraft from Russia.
[00:56:42.974 --> 00:56:44.395]  He has nothing to even do with it.
[00:56:44.395 --> 00:56:47.396]  He said, we're not going to, this isn't going to happen while he's president.
[00:56:47.396 --> 00:56:49.397]  They're talking about, you know, years from now.
[00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:50.690]  We're good to go.
[00:57:08.376 --> 00:57:15.741]  And you simply take advantage of this month's special, the 1776 Specials, where I've got many items that are $30, $40 at 1776.

[00:58:57.495 --> 00:59:03.558]  As most of you know, after being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:59:03.558 --> 00:59:06.399]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:59:06.399 --> 00:59:08.380]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:13.402]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:59:13.402 --> 00:59:15.503]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:59:15.503 --> 00:59:16.783]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:59:16.783 --> 00:59:21.906]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:59:21.906 --> 00:59:25.267]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants
[00:59:25.407 --> 00:59:25.927]  We're good to go!
[00:59:53.012 --> 00:59:54.435]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:13.624 --> 01:00:20.849]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[01:00:20.849 --> 01:00:24.851]  He is Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.851 --> 01:00:32.236]  Under my thumb, the girl who once had me down.
[01:00:32.236 --> 01:00:37.459]  Under my thumb, the girl who once pushed
[01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:45.338]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:00:45.338 --> 01:00:45.859]  to 3 p.m.
[01:00:45.859 --> 01:00:46.621]  we're here live.
[01:00:46.621 --> 01:00:49.307]  Jack Posobiec's got big breaking news from inside the White House.
[01:00:49.307 --> 01:00:50.991]  He's going to have to cover the waterfront.
[01:00:50.991 --> 01:00:52.133]  We'll also open the phones up.
[01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:56.192]  I haven't even gotten into the great job Sean Hannity is doing.
[01:00:56.192 --> 01:00:57.812]  I'm going to play that coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:57.812 --> 01:01:00.894]  The article's up on Infowars.com.
[01:01:00.894 --> 01:01:12.000]  Sean Hannity's saying if he finds he's been unmasked, because thousands of people that were involved with the Trump campaign are supporting the Make America Great Again operation, were surveilled by the NSA.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.721]  That's come out in leaked documents about yours truly.
[01:01:14.721 --> 01:01:20.945]  Michael Savage, he's saying that he's going to have the mother of all lawsuits if that is indeed the case.
[01:01:22.383 --> 01:01:25.826]  Well, that is the case.
[01:01:25.826 --> 01:01:30.429]  And we've got the liberal anti-Trump media goes all in for embattled General McMaster.
[01:01:30.429 --> 01:01:32.331]  That's another Breitbart story.
[01:01:32.331 --> 01:01:37.174]  We saw the Young Turks, funded by Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:37.174 --> 01:01:38.315]  We've seen CNN.
[01:01:38.315 --> 01:01:39.736]  We've seen MSNBC.
[01:01:39.736 --> 01:01:44.920]  We've seen all of them defending their little darling McMaster.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.983]  When Trump tried to get four different people to take the job, none of them wanted it.
[01:01:48.983 --> 01:01:50.965]  Because they knew if they were patriots, they'd be targeted.
[01:01:51.977 --> 01:01:53.678]  So they all dodged it.
[01:01:53.678 --> 01:01:56.339]  Flynn didn't dodge it.
[01:01:56.339 --> 01:01:59.820]  And now they're trying to get him criminally with a bunch of made-up garbage.
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:03.102]  See, Flynn didn't, wasn't involved in a dereliction of duty.
[01:02:03.102 --> 01:02:05.843]  And they slipped in McMaster, who it turns out is a big globalist.
[01:02:06.786 --> 01:02:11.128]  We've got so much coming up this hour with Jack Posobiec is going to ride shotgun with us.
[01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:17.292]  We're going to look at some of the people they've been removing from the National Security Council and it tells you everything you need to know.
[01:02:17.292 --> 01:02:23.616]  But Rich Higgins describes the information warfare the Muslim Brotherhood is engaging in with the left.
[01:02:23.616 --> 01:02:26.197]  Rich Higgins talks about the real threat of violent extremism.
[01:02:26.197 --> 01:02:29.059]  This is the guy that got fired last week.
[01:02:29.059 --> 01:02:32.701]  He gives strategic advice to the new administration.
[01:02:34.858 --> 01:02:38.280]  We have California crazies who aren't so crazy.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:41.221]  They want to tax you and control you.
[01:02:41.221 --> 01:02:44.483]  But they have their radicals say, kill your pet, you shouldn't be able to have a pet.
[01:02:44.483 --> 01:02:49.005]  It makes it sound less radical when they say, no, we're just going to tax you for having a pet because of the evil.
[01:02:49.005 --> 01:02:52.667]  They're already taxing cows in Canada and places, you know, for their flatulence.
[01:02:52.667 --> 01:02:55.889]  So why not tax there?
[01:02:55.889 --> 01:02:58.430]  And then we also have the Democrats want martial law.
[01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:59.210]  Very important report.
[01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:00.411]  We're going to get to all this today.
[01:03:01.952 --> 01:03:07.900]  We have the Democrat Senator Blumenthal's Justice Department is weaponizing leak laws for its personal and political ends.
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:15.028]  Yeah, they're doing illegal leaking and they're saying they're not going to arrest journalists like Obama did at a level never foreseen in U.S.
[01:03:15.028 --> 01:03:15.309]  history.
[01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:27.926]  But then the media is demonizing the fact that if you're in the White House leaking classified stuff, that is a felony.
[01:03:27.926 --> 01:03:28.846]  We're going to go after you.
[01:03:28.846 --> 01:03:31.127]  They're going, oh, this is so tyrannical.
[01:03:31.127 --> 01:03:33.088]  Again, they invert everything.
[01:03:33.088 --> 01:03:34.328]  And I know you know that.
[01:03:34.328 --> 01:03:38.690]  But the big hoax is that the president's numbers are down.
[01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:41.531]  The big hoax is that he's not doing well in the polls.
[01:03:43.297 --> 01:03:49.244]  And he's come out in speeches and in tweets and said, just like during the campaign, they told you I was unpopular when I wasn't.
[01:03:49.244 --> 01:03:57.853]  Our base is as big and successful as ever because we're delivering on the economy, delivering on the borders, delivering crushing political correctness, and we're all coming together.
[01:03:57.853 --> 01:03:59.816]  We've never been stronger because that's the truth.
[01:04:01.598 --> 01:04:03.119]  Gotta get the economy going again.
[01:04:03.119 --> 01:04:04.139]  We're trying.
[01:04:04.139 --> 01:04:05.559]  It's starting to get purchased.
[01:04:05.559 --> 01:04:06.600]  It's starting to get a toehold.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.840]  It's starting to roar back.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.341]  The elite are panicking and admittedly trying to kill it.
[01:04:10.341 --> 01:04:12.082]  Gotta expose the fake polls.
[01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:23.326]  Gotta expose how they're trying to legitimize, in deep state, the overthrow of the president, outside of government.
[01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:29.328]  You've got former Reagan officials saying Trump could be gone very soon, that the swamp is preparing to try to destroy him.
[01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:40.012]  Another big study out, letting illegals stay costs six times more than deporting them.
[01:04:40.012 --> 01:04:48.457]  There's this whole thing, and if you talk about illegals, especially that have committed crimes, being deported, you're somehow a meanie, when all these other countries deport you as well.
[01:04:48.457 --> 01:04:58.762]  It's just, it's like America has just been gilted into the most crazy mindsets of self-hate the world's ever seen, and regardless of what they do to Trump, we have won.
[01:05:01.283 --> 01:05:03.836]  By the fact that we've gotten so much done against the globalists.
[01:05:08.101 --> 01:05:09.502]  Why is the fungus?
[01:05:09.502 --> 01:05:10.583]  Why is the mold?
[01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:12.324]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[01:05:12.324 --> 01:05:13.305]  What is going on?
[01:05:13.305 --> 01:05:14.045]  What has changed?
[01:05:38.361 --> 01:05:39.782]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[01:05:39.782 --> 01:05:40.942]  I want to get your reviews.
[01:05:40.942 --> 01:05:41.763]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:05:41.763 --> 01:05:43.223]  For me, it's been incredible.
[01:05:43.223 --> 01:05:47.745]  MycoZX, antifungal, uh, antifungus, uh, anti-yeast.
[01:05:47.745 --> 01:05:48.466]  Get it today.
[01:05:48.466 --> 01:05:49.046]  Limited run.
[01:05:49.046 --> 01:05:50.467]  It'll be months till we get more.
[01:05:50.467 --> 01:05:55.129]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:55.129 --> 01:05:58.470]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[01:05:58.470 --> 01:06:00.791]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[01:06:00.791 --> 01:06:02.672]  Look at the response we're getting.
[01:06:02.672 --> 01:06:04.153]  We're changing the world together.
[01:06:04.153 --> 01:06:05.153]  You are the InfoWar.
[01:06:05.153 --> 01:06:05.914]  God bless you all.
[01:06:07.461 --> 01:06:12.123]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:06:12.123 --> 01:06:25.068]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:06:25.068 --> 01:06:31.651]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:06:31.651 --> 01:06:34.092]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[01:06:34.172 --> 01:06:45.405]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:06:45.405 --> 01:06:47.767]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[01:06:47.767 --> 01:06:49.229]  We're getting results.
[01:06:49.229 --> 01:06:55.196]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[01:06:55.336 --> 01:06:58.218]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[01:06:58.218 --> 01:07:07.363]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:07:07.363 --> 01:07:09.264]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:07:09.264 --> 01:07:11.285]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:07:11.285 --> 01:07:14.186]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:07:14.186 --> 01:07:16.748]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals,
[01:07:17.088 --> 01:07:20.250]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:29.435]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:07:29.435 --> 01:07:36.980]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:45.004]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:07:45.004 --> 01:07:45.965]  The general public doesn't.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:51.102]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:07:51.102 --> 01:07:54.684]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:07:54.684 --> 01:08:01.388]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:08:01.388 --> 01:08:09.413]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:08:09.413 --> 01:08:14.276]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:18.379 --> 01:08:23.604]  Now we've learned that the former Obama National Security Ben Rhodes is a person of interest.
[01:08:23.604 --> 01:08:23.864]  What?
[01:08:23.864 --> 01:08:27.307]  Of the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:08:27.307 --> 01:08:31.631]  Plus, Congress is now questioning other Obama officials.
[01:08:31.631 --> 01:08:42.860]  Susan Rice, Brennan, you know, Clapper literally set the stage for this by lessening the rules of unmasking from a very few to many.
[01:08:43.721 --> 01:08:46.764]  And then Obama changed the rules in 2011.
[01:08:46.764 --> 01:08:58.593]  And then, of course, 12333, just two weeks before he leaves office, where intelligence now could be shared with so many more agencies than ever before, which he never wanted to live under.
[01:08:58.593 --> 01:09:00.475]  This is what I've been telling you about.
[01:09:00.475 --> 01:09:02.196]  This is what I work on day and night.
[01:09:02.196 --> 01:09:03.638]  This is what keeps me up at night.
[01:09:04.818 --> 01:09:08.541]  And Congress is questioning these Obama officials, finally.
[01:09:08.541 --> 01:09:09.882]  And then Sarah Carter.
[01:09:09.882 --> 01:09:13.105]  And then on top of that, the special counsel of the FBI!
[01:09:13.105 --> 01:09:14.566]  And James Comey himself!
[01:09:15.663 --> 01:09:23.906]  Now, and then John Solomon reporting that the former Director of National Intelligence Clapper, by the way, he got a CNN gig and James Comey gets a book deal.
[01:09:23.906 --> 01:09:30.588]  But Clapper made it easier for officials in the executive branch to unmask members of Congress and their staffers.
[01:09:30.588 --> 01:09:35.869]  And I have it on pretty good authority that I've been unmasked, among other things.
[01:09:35.869 --> 01:09:37.330]  And by the way, if I find out
[01:09:38.639 --> 01:09:54.266]  I am going to sanction the biggest lawsuit that I possibly can with the biggest attorneys in this country so we can do something to stop the shredding of our Constitution.
[01:09:54.266 --> 01:09:57.987]  I will do that because that is illegal!
[01:09:57.987 --> 01:10:03.470]  And if my rights are violated, we will find a way to make this happen.
[01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:06.411]  Anyway, and it's not happening in a bubble here.
[01:10:07.219 --> 01:10:13.949]  Look at all their... Hillary Clinton, deleting, subpoenaed emails, bleach bit, hammering devices.
[01:10:13.949 --> 01:10:16.192]  Where's the special counsel for that?
[01:10:16.192 --> 01:10:21.981]  Where's the special counsel for 20% of uranium going to Russia and Putin?
[01:10:22.682 --> 01:10:30.044]  You know, really, at 145 million kickback and so much other evidence of kickbacks, look at what Judicial Watch found out this week.
[01:10:30.044 --> 01:10:38.927]  Where's the special counsel for a DNC paid operative meeting at the Ukrainian embassy with the Ukrainian ambassador?
[01:10:38.927 --> 01:10:45.509]  The Ukrainians leaking bad information and disseminating false information on Donald Trump.
[01:10:45.509 --> 01:10:49.310]  Very powerful to see Sean Hannity telling it like it is, and Sean Hannity
[01:10:50.566 --> 01:10:54.308]  Is one of the few shows that President Trump still watches.
[01:10:54.308 --> 01:10:56.528]  They have him totally isolated.
[01:10:56.528 --> 01:11:01.350]  That's been their plan all along.
[01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:07.133]  And you've got the Republicans raising seven times what they previously were this time a few years ago.
[01:11:07.133 --> 01:11:13.275]  You've got all these state houses going Republican, all these governors flipping Republican.
[01:11:13.275 --> 01:11:14.596]  Huge victories.
[01:11:14.596 --> 01:11:16.857]  The Democratic Party is being turned into a
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:46.221]  has been kook organization but they don't care because they're the establishment the top republicans were put in there you got this ex-reagan official saying that the republican leadership that the old man on the hill uses terms like that the wise men the never trumpers the neocons are preparing to remove him outside
[01:11:47.463 --> 01:11:48.884]  of impeachment.
[01:11:48.884 --> 01:11:52.407]  Stockman, who was director of the Office of Management and Budget.
[01:11:52.407 --> 01:12:07.520]  Ultimately, the hammer of fiscal crisis and crashing stock market, which they're trying to engage in, will break any remaining loyalty of the GOP elders as they smell the 2018 elections turning into a replay of the rout of 1974.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.182]  And then, Donald will be gone.
[01:12:10.182 --> 01:12:15.687]  And well before 2018, too, I told an audience in Vancouver last Friday, and it could happen,
[01:12:16.809 --> 01:12:26.155]  Stockman thinks Trump's ousting will be achieved probably by a threatened invocation of the 25th Amendment by the GOP elders on the hill.
[01:12:26.155 --> 01:12:28.596]  Well, this isn't Richard Nixon they're fighting with.
[01:12:28.596 --> 01:12:29.737]  It's Donald Trump.
[01:12:29.737 --> 01:12:30.458]  It's the internet.
[01:12:30.458 --> 01:12:32.039]  It's the 21st century.
[01:12:32.039 --> 01:12:41.405]  Now, it's true that Peter Thiel is in an article today that's posted up on InfoWars.com and DrugsReport.com.
[01:12:43.854 --> 01:12:48.337]  Now, it's from the fake news site BuzzFeed, so, I mean, who knows if it's true.
[01:12:48.337 --> 01:12:55.923]  I've had BuzzFeed write articles about me that literally have almost no truth in them.
[01:12:55.923 --> 01:13:02.008]  I mean, there'll be something in there like, Alex Jones was at the courthouse for a custody battle with his ex-wife.
[01:13:02.008 --> 01:13:03.429]  But that'd be the only part that was true.
[01:13:07.009 --> 01:13:11.173]  Only BuzzFeed and Daily Beast could be more fake than CNN.
[01:13:11.173 --> 01:13:13.855]  I mean, it is the standard of it.
[01:13:13.855 --> 01:13:15.977]  You know, PPGate, all of it came from them.
[01:13:17.847 --> 01:13:21.728]  Peter Thiel has been hedging his bet on Donald Trump.
[01:13:21.728 --> 01:13:28.331]  And he goes on to say that he's been telling people Trump's off to a great start, but behind the scenes thinks it's 50-50 he'll be removed.
[01:13:28.331 --> 01:13:29.631]  Well, I think it's more than 50-50.
[01:13:29.631 --> 01:13:35.153]  I think right now they're planning to blow Trump's head off or drug him and say he had a mental collapse.
[01:13:35.153 --> 01:13:40.235]  I mean, they're on television saying they're getting ready for that.
[01:13:40.235 --> 01:13:43.256]  And then separately, when I and others talk about it, they go, oh, you're crazy.
[01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:50.952]  They had Newsweek and a bunch of other fake news publications over the weekend say, look, Jones is crazy.
[01:13:50.952 --> 01:13:54.032]  He says there's a plan to overthrow the president.
[01:13:54.032 --> 01:13:57.813]  He's completely insane.
[01:13:57.813 --> 01:14:03.955]  And they never quote where I'm playing clips and showing news articles where they're saying it, but in establishment publications.
[01:14:05.745 --> 01:14:08.747]  Then they say, oh, Jones has been changing his story.
[01:14:08.747 --> 01:14:10.487]  He said they were going to steal the nomination.
[01:14:10.487 --> 01:14:14.590]  Then he said that they were going to steal him being seated as the president.
[01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:15.470]  Then he said they would.
[01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:17.291]  Yeah, they've been trying all along.
[01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:19.172]  We've been beating them.
[01:14:19.172 --> 01:14:21.773]  But they've been saying we're going to steal the nomination.
[01:14:21.773 --> 01:14:24.635]  They've been saying they're going to have faithless electors.
[01:14:24.635 --> 01:14:29.537]  And then we stood up to them, unlike Bernie Sanders with Hillary.
[01:14:29.537 --> 01:14:30.738]  But they act like, oh, look.
[01:14:32.489 --> 01:14:33.970]  He's not accurate.
[01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:55.597]  When I'm totally on target, that's why they can't stand it and have to engage in this alchemy where they go, okay, this guy's got our whole agenda, he's following what we're actually doing, he's warning people about the plan, and now Hannity and Limbaugh and everybody else have picked it up, and now what are we going to do because the public knows what we're doing, and they know our polls are fake, and they know that we're trying to break the base away from Trump.
[01:14:56.357 --> 01:15:11.748]  And they know that Fox News has even been turned against him, and they know that he's killed TPP, and the carbon tax, and secured the borders, and started the wall, and is trying to get the taxes cut, trying to kill Obamacare, and got a good bill through, but the Republicans killed it with John McCain, who broke his word.
[01:15:11.748 --> 01:15:13.209]  How do we turn that around?
[01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:16.612]  Obamacare, that's our fault, our big screwjob of them.
[01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:19.114]  Thank goodness they're so stupid, you know, Jonathan Gruber.
[01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.850]  How do we turn that?
[01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.111]  Well just say it's his.
[01:15:22.111 --> 01:15:22.992]  Say he failed.
[01:15:22.992 --> 01:15:24.313]  Say he got nothing done.
[01:15:24.313 --> 01:15:28.996]  Put him on the cover of Newsweek with a fake photo of him with Cheetos all over him.
[01:15:28.996 --> 01:15:32.798]  Sitting there watching TV and say he's a slob that never did anything.
[01:15:32.798 --> 01:15:33.839]  He's a failure.
[01:15:33.839 --> 01:15:35.140]  He didn't get elected.
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:36.541]  He never was successful.
[01:15:36.541 --> 01:15:37.961]  He never had children.
[01:15:37.961 --> 01:15:39.362]  He never had businesses.
[01:15:39.362 --> 01:15:42.624]  Donald Trump doesn't even exist.
[01:15:42.624 --> 01:15:46.007]  Just like they pretty much imply Seth Rich never existed.
[01:15:46.894 --> 01:15:51.997]  If you even talk about him shot in the back, they say, oh my gosh, incredible evil.
[01:15:51.997 --> 01:16:01.222]  Meanwhile, McMaster worked at Think Tank, backed by Soros funded group that helped Obama sell Iran nuclear deal.
[01:16:01.222 --> 01:16:03.363]  Yeah, they've totally double crossed us.
[01:16:03.363 --> 01:16:04.564]  I mean, when you realize that
[01:16:05.945 --> 01:16:20.176]  Once you go corrupt, once you're evil, once you decide to be evil, you automatically ally yourself with Islam because they've got more liquid cash than anybody, they're allied with the globalists, and they've got a project to end the Western world.
[01:16:20.176 --> 01:16:29.244]  Clapper and all of them are horrible people, and then we find out people inside the National Security Council that discovered this are fired!
[01:16:29.244 --> 01:16:30.545]  We're going to play some of those
[01:16:32.293 --> 01:16:39.939]  Interviews and speeches that really have gotten no play or no attention coming up and riding shotgun with us with real-time analysis of Jack Posobiec.
[01:16:39.939 --> 01:16:41.460]  Jack Posobiec.
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:43.101]  On Twitter, Jack Posobiec.
[01:16:43.101 --> 01:16:44.623]  CitizensforTrump.com.
[01:16:46.345 --> 01:16:58.489]  I want to cover the waterfront with him, the latest intel, the fight to isolate Trump, the fake polls they're putting out, the fact that Trump's launching the new Trump Channel embryonic phase, a once-a-week boil-down.
[01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:06.712]  Of course, CNN says it's fake news when he ran his own jobs numbers that the CBO admits are real.
[01:17:06.712 --> 01:17:12.874]  They blocked Drudge articles that Drudge tweeted from CNBC and AP on
[01:17:14.969 --> 01:17:22.191]  Eric Trump's Twitter Friday, we wrote a story about that, where they said, you're not allowed to share this, this is sensitive information.
[01:17:22.191 --> 01:17:28.493]  So now, they're just going to tell us, you can't see the jobs report, we're just going to tell you it's fake.
[01:17:28.493 --> 01:17:30.014]  And we're not going to let you see it.
[01:17:30.014 --> 01:17:35.796]  Next level deception, Jack Posobiec.
[01:17:35.796 --> 01:17:37.236]  You're exactly right, Alex.
[01:17:37.236 --> 01:17:42.818]  And I don't know if you saw just recently, earlier today, Donald Trump tried to retweet somebody on Twitter.
[01:17:43.331 --> 01:17:46.572]  As soon as he retweeted it, Twitter suspended that account.
[01:17:46.572 --> 01:17:54.274]  So instead of actually censoring it like they did with the Eric Trump tweet, they went and suspended this guy's complete account so you can't even see what it was.
[01:17:54.274 --> 01:17:58.715]  There isn't even an archive of what the President Trump was trying to share to the American people.
[01:17:58.715 --> 01:18:00.715]  He simply is trying to get information out.
[01:18:00.715 --> 01:18:01.976]  Twitter goes and zaps it away.
[01:18:01.976 --> 01:18:03.816]  It's even worse than what they did with Eric Trump.
[01:18:04.136 --> 01:18:09.758]  Because at least with that we could go in and we could sort of de-program it so we could see what actually he was trying to say.
[01:18:09.758 --> 01:18:11.459]  This one, they zapped his account.
[01:18:11.459 --> 01:18:15.581]  So President Trump says he wants to hear from you and Twitter zaps it away immediately.
[01:18:15.581 --> 01:18:25.485]  And what he's got to do now is he's got a screenshot, he's got a screenshot everything he's going to tweet and say here is what I'm tweeting so they de-six it, it comes back against them.
[01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:45.895]  That's right, and it's only going to further and further normalize the idea that they can control what Donald Trump says, that they can control what information Donald Trump shares, and because what they're also attempting to do behind the scenes is isolate the President's intake of information and control what information is given to him.
[01:18:45.895 --> 01:18:49.476]  They'll share with him the information about the job numbers.
[01:18:49.476 --> 01:18:51.077]  They'll share with him the information about
[01:18:51.488 --> 01:18:52.929]  The stock market going up.
[01:18:52.929 --> 01:18:58.974]  But they won't share with him the information about who's getting fired in the administration, about the Obama holders that are coming over.
[01:18:58.974 --> 01:19:00.535]  I've got breaking news on that.
[01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:05.919]  And they won't share with him information on different deals in diplomacy that they're trying to make with foreign policy.
[01:19:05.919 --> 01:19:08.801]  So he tries to go and do something on China, for example.
[01:19:08.801 --> 01:19:10.583]  They turn around and said, oh, no, you can't do that.
[01:19:10.583 --> 01:19:13.065]  We already made a deal with the Chinese behind your back.
[01:19:13.065 --> 01:19:14.746]  And he says, what are you talking about?
[01:19:14.746 --> 01:19:15.607]  And they show it to him then.
[01:19:16.923 --> 01:19:20.686]  That's right, we're going to break all this down, what's behind the McMaster situation.
[01:19:20.686 --> 01:19:33.117]  But doesn't the Young Turks and CNN get, and MSNBC, when they fully endorsed him last week, protecting him from you and Cernovich and myself and Breitbart and everybody else, just exposing that he's worse than Brennan?
[01:19:33.117 --> 01:19:37.160]  Not officially converted to Islam like Brennan, but pretty much so.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.861]  I mean, that he's totally sold out.
[01:19:39.762 --> 01:19:46.527]  Don't they understand that when they super-endorsed him, that no matter how they try to isolate the president, that's never going to work?
[01:19:46.527 --> 01:19:48.749]  Jack Posobiec.
[01:19:48.749 --> 01:19:53.733]  We're going to come back to him to break down what's really behind McMaster and so much more.
[01:19:53.733 --> 01:19:54.374]  And then Clips.
[01:19:55.407 --> 01:19:57.669]  Are you one of the 15 million men who suffer from an enlarged prostate?

[01:23:59.341 --> 01:24:02.102]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com.
[01:24:02.102 --> 01:24:03.342]  FullyCookedBacon.com.
[01:24:10.398 --> 01:24:33.170]  You see, there's always been such subterfuge in our government, in the last 30, 40 years particularly, that different power factions would battle over manipulating the special interests.
[01:24:34.952 --> 01:24:46.981]  And now President Trump has come in, gotten rid of all the lobbyists, and literally now looks at each thing about what is fair, and what is good for the economy, and what is good for security.
[01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:52.285]  It is the most pragmatic, direct, honest, good governing I've ever seen.
[01:24:53.188 --> 01:24:55.731]  And when he makes mistakes, he finds out about it and changes it.
[01:24:55.731 --> 01:24:57.052]  He doesn't flip-flop.
[01:24:57.052 --> 01:24:58.734]  He says, I was wrong and changes it.
[01:24:58.734 --> 01:25:00.375]  It's so refreshing.
[01:25:00.375 --> 01:25:12.287]  And the special interests that had hijacked and were running this country, and who were dominating the globe through our treasure, through our energy, have sold out to radical Islam, have sold out to communist China.
[01:25:12.287 --> 01:25:16.432]  They're the traitors, and they are now panicking that Trump's dismantled this.
[01:25:17.551 --> 01:25:20.953]  You know, you tell Trump, sir, they're in the New York Times saying they're spying on you.
[01:25:20.953 --> 01:25:22.214]  Then he says, hey, don't spy on me.
[01:25:22.214 --> 01:25:23.235]  And they go, we never did that.
[01:25:23.235 --> 01:25:25.556]  And he goes, here's the New York Times.
[01:25:25.556 --> 01:25:26.817]  Then they say, oh, he's wrong.
[01:25:26.817 --> 01:25:28.118]  We never said that.
[01:25:28.118 --> 01:25:30.579]  As if we don't have the cover of the New York Times.
[01:25:30.579 --> 01:25:34.301]  They talk to us like we're morons.
[01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:37.063]  It's called gaslighting.
[01:25:37.063 --> 01:25:39.685]  Now, this is a short segment, long segment coming up with Jack Posobiec.
[01:25:40.458 --> 01:25:46.840]  I want to walk through all this because a lot of smart people, quote smart, are hedging their bets.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:51.021]  When you get something this real, you don't hedge your bets, you're all in.
[01:25:51.021 --> 01:25:53.342]  Especially when there's no hedging your bet.
[01:25:53.342 --> 01:25:58.243]  Going along with the globalists doesn't mean they pat you on the head and you get a seat at the table.
[01:25:58.243 --> 01:26:06.246]  It just means you're delusional when you stand around a church or the water cooler and go, yeah, I'm kind of mad at Trump too.
[01:26:07.006 --> 01:26:14.692]  And you buy into all the backbiting when he is epically carrying this country on his shoulders.
[01:26:14.692 --> 01:26:26.982]  I cannot help but admire President Trump, and I want to salute and thank all of you that are praying for President Trump, and ask you to pray for us as well, because we are changing the world together.
[01:26:26.982 --> 01:26:28.383]  We are beginning to turn the corner.
[01:26:29.364 --> 01:26:33.705]  And this is such a historic fight and it's a test of mind control.
[01:26:33.705 --> 01:26:38.587]  Can media mind control break the back of the people and stop this revolution?
[01:26:38.587 --> 01:26:40.267]  And the answer is no.
[01:26:40.267 --> 01:26:44.788]  The question is do we defeat them right now and have a big huge win and society turn around?
[01:26:44.788 --> 01:26:44.828]  Or...
[01:26:48.740 --> 01:26:49.821]  Is Trump just a beachhead?
[01:26:49.821 --> 01:26:50.681]  They destroy him.
[01:26:50.681 --> 01:26:51.722]  We move forward.
[01:26:51.722 --> 01:26:52.902]  Populism awakens.
[01:26:52.902 --> 01:26:54.283]  Globalism's in trouble.
[01:26:54.283 --> 01:26:54.923]  Crippled.
[01:26:54.923 --> 01:26:56.284]  And we move forward from there.
[01:26:56.284 --> 01:26:59.066]  They fight back with authoritarianism to try to shut us down.
[01:26:59.066 --> 01:27:00.907]  It'll probably go hot.
[01:27:00.907 --> 01:27:03.508]  I don't want to go down that road, but we don't have a choice.
[01:27:03.508 --> 01:27:05.750]  Either way, we fight, we win.
[01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:06.370]  Jack Posobiec.
[01:27:08.203 --> 01:27:09.604]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:27:09.604 --> 01:27:13.527]  And what Peter Thiel was saying, I think that BuzzFeed is really taking him out of context here.
[01:27:13.527 --> 01:27:20.652]  He was saying that the fight against the deep state, the fight against the entrenched establishment, is harder than he thought it would be.
[01:27:20.652 --> 01:27:22.554]  It is fiercer than he thought it would be.
[01:27:22.554 --> 01:27:27.998]  And that is why he sees them fighting so hard and sees President Trump fighting back against them as hard.
[01:27:27.998 --> 01:27:31.180]  You know, you talk about these warrantless wiretaps and FISA courts.
[01:27:31.701 --> 01:27:33.782]  Who set up the warrantless wiretap system?
[01:27:33.782 --> 01:27:35.542]  Why, it was Robert Mueller.
[01:27:35.542 --> 01:27:43.885]  The same Robert Mueller we're now told is the Independent Special Counsel who's investigating this Russia stuff and that there's no ties or bias to him whatsoever.
[01:27:43.885 --> 01:27:53.728]  This is the same Robert Mueller who was tied to the wiretapping, the same Robert Mueller who was tied to Iraq WMD, the Anthrax hoax where they actually... He's Hoax Mueller!
[01:27:53.728 --> 01:27:56.009]  He's the opposite of independent.
[01:27:56.009 --> 01:27:57.109]  He's the opposite of independent.
[01:27:58.899 --> 01:28:01.162]  You're right, and now we're told to forget all of that.
[01:28:01.162 --> 01:28:11.313]  It's like the entire mainstream media has amnesia when they talk about him, because they come up and say, well, he's completely independent, and he's like Jimmy Stewart there in Washington as a G-man.
[01:28:11.313 --> 01:28:14.978]  No, I would say he's more like J. Edgar Hoover when it comes to the FBI.
[01:28:14.978 --> 01:28:17.581]  Using blackmail, using control, absolutely.
[01:28:19.224 --> 01:28:23.349]  I'm not even really sure he ever really gave up the reins of the FBI to James Comey.
[01:28:23.349 --> 01:28:27.493]  Remember, he stayed there for two extra years after Obama came into power.
[01:28:27.493 --> 01:28:32.279]  He asked him to stay on for two extra years and then hand it over to his very good friend James Comey.
[01:28:32.279 --> 01:28:38.606]  His and Comey's relationship has been described in DC as one of the closest relationships of any two members.
[01:28:39.986 --> 01:28:45.088]  It's an evil power group.
[01:28:45.088 --> 01:28:50.709]  It's an evil, unconstitutional, little wannabe coup group that really thinks so much of themselves.
[01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:51.669]  And that's what I hate, man.
[01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:54.810]  I want to see this evil power over America broken.
[01:28:54.810 --> 01:28:55.170]  Don't you?
[01:28:55.170 --> 01:28:59.311]  Aren't you sick of the cabals and the Clintons and all these globalists that are so arrogant?
[01:29:00.878 --> 01:29:01.438]  It's ridiculous.
[01:29:01.438 --> 01:29:10.761]  They're going to send somebody out here, someone who's working for the Bush administration, someone who's tied to the Clintons as well, and they're going to tell us that we have to listen to him as well because we see what's going on.
[01:29:10.761 --> 01:29:13.402]  We see the establishment going up against Trump.
[01:29:13.402 --> 01:29:19.764]  They call Trump a traitor while they're trying to overthrow the democratically elected government of the United States.
[01:29:19.764 --> 01:29:20.204]  Period.
[01:29:20.204 --> 01:29:20.824]  It's disgusting.
[01:29:20.824 --> 01:29:23.185]  All right, we got a long segment coming up.
[01:29:23.185 --> 01:29:28.546]  I want to really, because I've done a lot of research, you've done a lot of research, and I saw the stuff about McMaster.
[01:29:28.546 --> 01:29:29.787]  I knew a lot of it, but I spent
[01:29:31.082 --> 01:29:31.442]  I don't know.
[01:29:47.116 --> 01:29:56.845]  McMaster is just nightmarish, but through who he's fired, it gives you a window into exactly the type of nasty Islamicist agents we're dealing with.
[01:29:56.845 --> 01:30:04.333]  I mean, they buy these guys off, folks, and they just want to blow up Western civilization, just like they blow up all the churches.
[01:30:08.559 --> 01:30:09.980]  Why is the fungus?
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:11.061]  Why is the mold?
[01:30:11.061 --> 01:30:12.782]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[01:30:12.782 --> 01:30:13.763]  What is going on?
[01:30:13.763 --> 01:30:14.523]  What has changed?
[01:30:38.819 --> 01:30:40.240]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.281]  I want to get your reviews.
[01:30:41.281 --> 01:30:42.242]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:30:42.242 --> 01:30:43.703]  For me, it's been incredible.
[01:30:43.703 --> 01:30:48.206]  MycoZX antifungal, uh, antifungus, uh, anti-yeast.
[01:30:48.206 --> 01:30:49.046]  Get it today.
[01:30:49.046 --> 01:30:49.526]  Limited run.
[01:30:49.526 --> 01:30:50.927]  It'll be months till we get more.
[01:30:50.927 --> 01:30:55.591]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:30:55.591 --> 01:30:58.933]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[01:30:58.933 --> 01:31:01.274]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[01:31:01.274 --> 01:31:02.675]  Look at the response we're getting.
[01:31:02.675 --> 01:31:04.617]  We're changing the world together.
[01:31:04.617 --> 01:31:05.637]  You are the Infowar.
[01:31:05.637 --> 01:31:06.378]  God bless you all.
[01:31:07.907 --> 01:31:13.611]  Rediscover your fire with the EcoZoom Coal Rocket Camping Stove.
[01:31:13.611 --> 01:31:21.617]  It's easy to light and you can cook with wood, charcoal, or any biomass fuel in a rugged and durable design.
[01:31:21.617 --> 01:31:24.759]  And that means big power in a portable package.
[01:31:24.759 --> 01:31:30.804]  The Versa cooks fast, it produces less smoke, and it's fuel efficient.
[01:31:30.804 --> 01:31:34.987]  No wonder the Versa is the most popular model in America.
[01:31:35.387 --> 01:31:41.432]  It's the ultimate stove for camping, outdoor cooking, or emergency preparedness.
[01:31:41.432 --> 01:31:48.018]  All it takes is a handful of sticks or charcoal and you've got yourself an entire meal.
[01:31:48.018 --> 01:31:49.740]  Now that looks good.
[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:56.466]  Go to Infowarsstore.com for more details and see how you can become the master outdoor chef.
[01:31:57.086 --> 01:32:02.570]  And enjoy cooking freedom with the EcoZoom Versa Outdoor Stove.
[01:32:02.570 --> 01:32:07.713]  Available right now at, you guessed it, Infowarestore.com.
[01:32:07.713 --> 01:32:12.056]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:32:12.376 --> 01:32:25.325]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:32:25.325 --> 01:32:31.889]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:32:31.889 --> 01:32:34.371]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[01:32:34.411 --> 01:32:45.644]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:32:45.644 --> 01:32:48.006]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[01:32:48.006 --> 01:32:49.488]  We're getting results.
[01:32:49.488 --> 01:32:55.435]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[01:32:55.575 --> 01:32:58.458]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[01:32:58.458 --> 01:33:05.204]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, AAA253-3139.
[01:33:05.204 --> 01:33:06.285]  We are on the march.
[01:33:06.285 --> 01:33:08.247]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:08.247 --> 01:33:13.512]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:23.419 --> 01:33:33.364]  It's not like I get up here and I tell you, hey, spread our videos, spread our articles, and we'll change the world together, and I'm just saying that.
[01:33:33.364 --> 01:33:34.105]  It's really happening.
[01:33:35.146 --> 01:33:40.552]  And they admittedly, Google's hired private companies to try to delist us on the internet.
[01:33:40.552 --> 01:33:44.557]  They've got groups out there claiming our information is bots.
[01:33:44.557 --> 01:33:47.721]  And so they'll just delist our videos or block our tweets.
[01:33:47.721 --> 01:33:52.806]  They've just done the same thing to Trump today because a tweet got through that he could see at the top.
[01:33:53.487 --> 01:33:58.032]  Because they have it set where only negative tweets get to the top using real bots.
[01:33:58.032 --> 01:34:01.696]  Facebook, Twitter, Google, they all admit to using them against Trump.
[01:34:01.696 --> 01:34:08.563]  And then so somebody did use a bot to be able to get around that and vote it up so that he could see it.
[01:34:08.563 --> 01:34:13.428]  So they deleted that person's account saying you used a system to beat our AI.
[01:34:14.821 --> 01:34:20.843]  Remember our Google bomb that listeners developed, where every day I could control the search results on Google?
[01:34:20.843 --> 01:34:23.864]  I would only use it like every few weeks though, I should have used it every day.
[01:34:23.864 --> 01:34:30.706]  Because after three years of Google bombs, they changed the entire Google algorithm to stop us.
[01:34:30.706 --> 01:34:32.507]  Remember that?
[01:34:32.507 --> 01:34:36.768]  Now sure, we had millions of listeners, you were searching the term, but
[01:34:38.387 --> 01:34:50.855]  Then they started trying to block us in real time, so programmers came up with bots that would hammer the term thousands of times a second per bot entry, basically, and so they learned to block those.
[01:34:50.855 --> 01:34:55.518]  Well, they used the exact same stuff, but many times more sophisticated against us.
[01:34:56.579 --> 01:35:00.122]  But nothing can stop you calling into C-SPAN and plugging InfoWars.com.
[01:35:00.122 --> 01:35:05.006]  Nothing can stop you from working into the conversation saying, I think InfoWars.com is the real news.
[01:35:05.006 --> 01:35:06.046]  That's why it's cutting edge.
[01:35:06.046 --> 01:35:08.989]  That's why it's exposing the dinosaur media that's collapsing.
[01:35:08.989 --> 01:35:10.590]  What do you think?
[01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:12.732]  Bring it into the conversations.
[01:35:12.732 --> 01:35:14.433]  Calling into National Talk Radio.
[01:35:14.433 --> 01:35:16.715]  Calling in to CNN.
[01:35:16.715 --> 01:35:18.176]  Calling into these programs.
[01:35:18.176 --> 01:35:19.717]  Letting them know you're awake.
[01:35:19.717 --> 01:35:21.038]  Spreading our articles, our videos.
[01:35:21.038 --> 01:35:22.799]  It's changing the world.
[01:35:22.799 --> 01:35:23.360]  But also,
[01:35:24.867 --> 01:35:38.294]  Remembering that when you financially support us getting products like high quality water filtration, air filtration systems, supplements, nutraceuticals, Patriot apparel, books, films, you name it, like Milo's new book.
[01:35:38.294 --> 01:35:42.356]  When you buy from us, you get really good deals, products you need,
[01:35:44.156 --> 01:35:47.721]  And it makes the tip of the spear possible because we're not funded by George Soros.
[01:35:47.721 --> 01:35:56.133]  We didn't get a couple billion dollars like NBC's parent company for MSNBC and CNBC to give Rachel Maddow a raise.
[01:35:56.133 --> 01:35:57.395]  We don't get globalist money.
[01:35:57.395 --> 01:35:59.858]  We just find the best products out there like Alexa Breeze.
[01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:08.112]  We were going to stop having this at 25% off because it's already at $219 for this space-age air filtration system.
[01:36:08.112 --> 01:36:12.873]  Just a few years ago, when we first offered it, it was like $800 a unit or similar units.
[01:36:12.873 --> 01:36:13.514]  We were offering for $250.
[01:36:13.514 --> 01:36:14.854]  Now they're $219 normally.
[01:36:14.854 --> 01:36:15.034]  They're $149.
[01:36:15.034 --> 01:36:15.995]  No one can top a deal like this.
[01:36:15.995 --> 01:36:16.475]  And it was so popular.
[01:36:16.475 --> 01:36:16.855]  It was a big sale.
[01:36:22.637 --> 01:36:24.258]  So a lot of folks asked us to bring it back.
[01:36:24.258 --> 01:36:27.240]  The manufacturer asked us to bring it back because it's so successful.
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.223]  They've given us a great deal on it, or we wouldn't make any money at this price.
[01:36:30.223 --> 01:36:31.944]  I can tell you that's how discounted it is.
[01:36:31.944 --> 01:36:39.349]  So the manufacturers had to give us the super, super low price to basically be like, they're making like $5 or something on it at this price.
[01:36:39.349 --> 01:36:43.672]  And we're making like, you know, 30, 40 bucks, which we need to make to fund the operation.
[01:36:43.672 --> 01:36:46.134]  So Alexa Pure Breeze, a great deal at $219, $149 right now.
[01:36:50.276 --> 01:36:52.158]  At InfowarsStore.com.
[01:36:52.158 --> 01:36:56.081]  And we have the 1776 specials we're running throughout the month.

[01:37:39.134 --> 01:37:45.996]  2,499 reviews, 4.8 stars, with Power Reviews, one of the biggest third-party sites out there.
[01:37:45.996 --> 01:37:47.176]  Unbelievable.

[01:37:49.177 --> 01:37:51.197]  You understand this is a war.
[01:37:51.197 --> 01:37:56.799]  Now, going back to Jack Posobiec, everybody follow on Twitter at Jack Posobiec, citizensfortrump.com,
[01:37:58.752 --> 01:38:02.973]  Investigative journalist, more and more, doing great reportage for us as well up there in DC.
[01:38:02.973 --> 01:38:04.373]  Bold fighter.
[01:38:04.373 --> 01:38:06.834]  Let's get into the big issue here.
[01:38:06.834 --> 01:38:10.294]  This window into how they plan to bring down Trump.
[01:38:10.294 --> 01:38:14.735]  The hoax they're selling, just like Hillary couldn't be beaten, he's going to be taken out.
[01:38:14.735 --> 01:38:20.296]  They're bold statements that they're preparing to just remove him in some type of coup.
[01:38:20.296 --> 01:38:21.917]  They have to go public with it.
[01:38:21.917 --> 01:38:23.237]  People say, why have a public coup?
[01:38:23.897 --> 01:38:31.101]  Because they have to legitimize it in the minds of media, the public, and the people that they're trying to get ready for this coup.
[01:38:31.101 --> 01:38:34.323]  You talk about dangerous separation of powers.
[01:38:34.323 --> 01:38:36.444]  The president has a right to fight this coup.
[01:38:36.444 --> 01:38:37.825]  In fact, he has a duty.
[01:38:37.825 --> 01:38:40.707]  But they're going to say that's a terrorist operation.
[01:38:40.707 --> 01:38:43.949]  They're going to seize control of the media with the Obama kill switch.
[01:38:43.949 --> 01:38:45.330]  That's why they're isolating the president.
[01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:47.091]  That's why Twitter's censoring him.
[01:38:48.041 --> 01:38:54.604]  Meanwhile, McMaster worked at Think Tank, backed by Soros-funded group that helped Obama sell Iran deal.
[01:38:54.604 --> 01:38:58.286]  That's the latest from Breitbart today, showing Bannon's fighting back.
[01:38:58.286 --> 01:39:00.708]  Showing Bannon's true colors, that he is a patriot.
[01:39:00.708 --> 01:39:02.188]  Deep State's gonna kill the President.
[01:39:02.188 --> 01:39:03.749]  Alex Jones, Newsweek.
[01:39:03.749 --> 01:39:09.932]  Report McMaster fired National Security Council official for penning memo on globalists and their alliance with Islam.
[01:39:09.932 --> 01:39:11.193]  And it explains the whole thing.
[01:39:11.193 --> 01:39:14.195]  We're gonna play in the next hour, link the excerpts of that.
[01:39:15.046 --> 01:39:21.968]  But let's walk through why a top FBI agent warns McMaster is the enemy camp.
[01:39:21.968 --> 01:39:27.630]  I mean, you think we just had Brennan over the CIA that's converted to Wahhabism?
[01:39:27.630 --> 01:39:34.813]  Folks, you think Mueller took Islam, radical Islam, off the list of terrorism and made it Christians, being the number one threat group with no evidence?
[01:39:34.813 --> 01:39:36.873]  This didn't just happen overnight.
[01:39:36.873 --> 01:39:38.874]  There's a billion and a half Muslims.
[01:39:38.874 --> 01:39:41.315]  There's going to be three billion by 2027, ten years from now, 2026.
[01:39:45.185 --> 01:39:47.346]  The globalists have made their bet.
[01:39:47.346 --> 01:39:48.526]  We've been domesticated.
[01:39:48.526 --> 01:39:49.606]  We've been made weak.
[01:39:49.606 --> 01:39:52.207]  Now they're bringing in military-age men.
[01:39:52.207 --> 01:39:53.408]  They're putting them in positions of power.
[01:39:53.408 --> 01:39:55.368]  Europe's already falling.
[01:39:55.368 --> 01:40:07.812]  I have to say to a lot of the hardcore right-wingers who said this 20 years ago, I thought you were nuts about caliphate, about Sharia law, because I couldn't imagine even our own evil elite would do something this crazy.
[01:40:07.812 --> 01:40:09.653]  But they hate Christianity so much,
[01:40:10.569 --> 01:40:21.259]  And are so committed that they funded ISIS and Al-Qaeda that blew up thousands of churches in the Middle East the last six years, under Obama, the Muslim Brotherhood, his cousin, Odinga, all of it.
[01:40:21.259 --> 01:40:22.200]  It's come out in court.
[01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:35.190]  This was an actual super double-cross, and now we're in red-level crisis, and they're sabotaging the military with trannies and sex changes to sabotage it.
[01:40:35.190 --> 01:40:39.193]  Jack Posobiec, while defending Islamists is throwing gay people off buildings.
[01:40:39.193 --> 01:40:43.377]  Jack, lay this out for us, your report, while you're really here on McMaster.
[01:40:45.066 --> 01:40:52.470]  One of the top things that I can break today and my sources confirmed to me that there are four people on the NSC that are still on the NSC.
[01:40:52.470 --> 01:41:02.076]  Not only are they holdovers from the Obama administration, but these people are direct reports to Ben Rhodes, the former Obama security advisor.
[01:41:02.076 --> 01:41:05.778]  So they were people that were directly working for Ben Rhodes.
[01:41:05.778 --> 01:41:09.740]  Ben Rhodes, as we know, is still in communication with Barack Obama.
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:11.421]  So for all intents and purposes,
[01:41:11.789 --> 01:41:17.493]  You can say that these people are working on the NSC, but are still able to get information back to Barack Obama.
[01:41:17.493 --> 01:41:31.623]  It's Abigail Grace, Fernando Coutts, Andrea Hall, and Mary Lynn, four members, each special assistants in different sections of the NSC, special assistants... They're all over the key hiring, so that's how they create the logjams.
[01:41:33.925 --> 01:41:44.433]  Right, and so they will prevent anyone from being hired that is with the Trump campaign, that is with Trump in terms of ideology, like Rich Higgins was.
[01:41:44.433 --> 01:41:51.398]  And if they find out that someone was, like Rich Higgins, KT McFarlane, Tara Dahl, Derek Harvey, they're immediately sent out.
[01:41:51.398 --> 01:41:57.082]  And the main reason these people are sent out is because they are able to get information to President Trump
[01:41:57.382 --> 01:41:58.863]  That they don't want getting to him.
[01:41:58.863 --> 01:42:00.604]  They want to control his information.
[01:42:00.604 --> 01:42:11.812]  That's why we're hearing now the closed door of the Oval Office, shutting the door of the Oval Office, Kelly behind that, saying they're going to censor his tweets, saying they don't want, they don't want President Trump looking at Twitter.
[01:42:11.812 --> 01:42:13.253]  They don't want him going to that.
[01:42:13.253 --> 01:42:15.975]  They're going to check with his tweets before they put it out.
[01:42:15.975 --> 01:42:17.636]  So they're going to write his tweets for him.
[01:42:17.636 --> 01:42:25.301]  And numerous reports that have been coming out as well, saying that the statement that was put out last Friday night, very late last Friday night on H.R.
[01:42:25.301 --> 01:42:26.882]  McMaster in defense of him,
[01:42:27.296 --> 01:42:34.161]  Was not written by the president nor was it seen even by the president that it was put out in his name multiple accounts.
[01:42:34.161 --> 01:42:42.746]  And by the way I got that I got that Sunday when I saw it and Saturday and talked to top people and indeed I've never even said that on air because I don't want to give up any sources.
[01:42:42.746 --> 01:42:44.267]  I guess now it's safe to bring that out.
[01:42:44.267 --> 01:42:46.889]  The president never saw that while he was in New Jersey.
[01:42:46.889 --> 01:42:53.473]  They just are doing whatever they want already acting like he's a buffoon incontinent already acting like he's
[01:42:53.473 --> 01:42:56.696]  You know, he needs to be put in a nursing home when he's sharper than all of them put together.
[01:42:56.696 --> 01:42:59.439]  They're already behaving with total belligerence.
[01:42:59.439 --> 01:43:07.507]  And what about the reports that McMaster constantly trashes Trump to everybody, loving being a darling of the media?
[01:43:07.507 --> 01:43:16.436]  Well, McMaster is going around and telling, you know, the president will have a phone call with somebody and then McMaster will call his counterpart and completely counterman everything the president said about it.
[01:43:16.863 --> 01:43:18.364]  How do we stop President McMaster after you make your point?
[01:43:36.092 --> 01:43:36.532]  Sure.
[01:43:36.532 --> 01:43:55.479]  We've got to be able to get information to President Trump, whether that's through emissaries, bringing him actual memos, actual documentation into the Oval Office, meeting him personally either at Trump Tower, he says he's going to be there this week for meetings, going and getting the information directly to him, and people via social media.
[01:43:55.479 --> 01:43:58.261]  They can't stop Trump from getting on social media.
[01:43:58.261 --> 01:44:01.942]  So people going on there, until your ban, until your account is banned and killed, it's down.
[01:44:02.301 --> 01:44:03.502]  You've got a voice.
[01:44:03.502 --> 01:44:09.769]  You can use that social media as a two-way street of communication between you and the President.
[01:44:09.769 --> 01:44:10.830]  He's going to see it.
[01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:15.515]  We saw one woman, a black conservative, who was trying to get her message to the President.
[01:44:15.515 --> 01:44:19.319]  She got one message to him, he retweets her, and immediately she was suspended.
[01:44:19.319 --> 01:44:23.503]  So the President saw her, and immediately Twitter decided to shut her down.
[01:44:23.823 --> 01:44:28.466]  That is what they're trying to do and that's why it's so important for us to reach out directly to the president.
[01:44:28.466 --> 01:44:31.327]  They want to cut the people off from the president.
[01:44:31.327 --> 01:44:36.030]  They want to put him like in the Forbidden City like they did with Chinese emperors and totally control him.
[01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:42.773]  I mean this is epic to watch and they admit their strategy is to isolate him to bring him down.
[01:44:42.773 --> 01:44:43.814]  I mean this is incredible.
[01:44:43.814 --> 01:44:45.275]  What do you think the president should do?
[01:44:45.275 --> 01:44:50.898]  I think the president at this point should absolutely fire Bob Mueller.
[01:44:51.549 --> 01:44:57.234]  People are making connections back to Archibald Cox and Richard Nixon, the Saturday Night Massacre.
[01:44:57.234 --> 01:45:02.058]  I think if anyone should go, it's Robert Mueller at this point.
[01:45:02.058 --> 01:45:09.004]  He stands as someone who is not independent, who is absolutely not independent of the process.
[01:45:09.004 --> 01:45:14.128]  He's been involved since pre-911 with the federal government, with the federal administration and establishment.
[01:45:14.128 --> 01:45:19.092]  And it'll be seen as strength to get rid of him before they crash the economy.
[01:45:20.697 --> 01:45:30.205]  Right, before they crash the economy, before they're able to essentially, what they want to do with this grand jury is find a way to trump up charges against the president and bring an indictment.
[01:45:30.205 --> 01:45:38.952]  Or they'll say, we're going to bring an indictment against you, we've got some documents, whether they be true or not, and they're going to ask for the president's resignation.
[01:45:38.952 --> 01:45:43.296]  And they're trying to just spin the wheels and tell him everything is going fine up until they get to that point.
[01:45:43.656 --> 01:45:45.077]  That is Mueller's endgame.
[01:45:45.077 --> 01:45:46.417]  That's the Deep State's endgame.
[01:45:46.417 --> 01:45:49.899]  Exact same thing they've been using against Netanyahu.
[01:45:49.899 --> 01:45:53.321]  Exact same thing they've been using against Netanyahu.
[01:45:53.321 --> 01:45:53.981]  Yes.
[01:45:53.981 --> 01:45:59.744]  They want to make him completely inundated with scandal after scandal so that their agenda can't actually be passed.
[01:45:59.744 --> 01:46:01.445]  They can't get any of the executive orders out.
[01:46:01.445 --> 01:46:03.246]  They can't get legislation passed.
[01:46:03.246 --> 01:46:03.966]  Think about it, Alex.
[01:46:03.966 --> 01:46:05.967]  Why haven't we seen legislation for the wall?
[01:46:06.445 --> 01:46:08.387]  For infrastructure, for tax cuts.
[01:46:08.387 --> 01:46:16.517]  They're doing all of this to prevent President Trump's agenda from getting put into place because that's the scariest thing possible to this power elite that's out there.
[01:46:16.966 --> 01:46:26.010]  And then they turn around and run another fake Newsweek cover, not the one where they said Hillary was the president, and how she won, and photos of her winning that night, all fake.
[01:46:26.010 --> 01:46:30.972]  They have a new one of him photoshopped in a chair, lazy, and it says, zero accomplishments.
[01:46:30.972 --> 01:46:44.617]  No, zero accomplishments with the traitors in Congress, through the executive, devastating victories, the economy coming back, the border getting secured, the TPP killed, the carbon tax killed, America open for business again.
[01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:49.162]  When I saw that cover, I thought it was Mad Magazine instead of Newsweek.
[01:46:49.162 --> 01:46:51.784]  I guess we should call it Fake Newsweek for now.
[01:46:51.784 --> 01:47:00.949]  I mean, this is the same media that just a few weeks ago, Fake Week, was telling us how President Trump's hectic work schedule was making them all tired.
[01:47:00.949 --> 01:47:04.192]  If there's anything they want to accuse the President of being lazy, it's certainly not one of them.
[01:47:04.192 --> 01:47:07.714]  This is a guy two, three hours of sleep at night, if that.
[01:47:07.714 --> 01:47:14.178]  He's constantly working, he's constantly on the phone, and he's been on record for doing that throughout the campaign and the early days of the administration.
[01:47:14.525 --> 01:47:20.168]  So for Newsweek to come out and say it's news, to put up a Mad Magazine cover of him, it's ridiculous.
[01:47:20.168 --> 01:47:28.614]  Even other journalists and people that are still trying to hold on to some semblance of independence in the industry are saying it's a completely ridiculous attack on the President.
[01:47:28.614 --> 01:47:29.954]  Well Jack, that's the thing for me.
[01:47:29.954 --> 01:47:32.696]  I watch CNN and MSNBC now.
[01:47:32.696 --> 01:47:36.778]  It's such upside-down world cartoon level that I don't even know what they're doing.
[01:47:38.079 --> 01:47:59.159]  I played a clip last hour of CNN saying that the new video service, the new news service he's launched, finally the beginning of the Fireside Chats, that we know was heavily pushed by the outgoing head of communications, Scaramucci, they're saying, oh look, fake news, he's claiming he has good jobs numbers and he's putting it out.
[01:47:59.159 --> 01:48:00.621]  That's not fake news, that was true!
[01:48:03.527 --> 01:48:04.967]  That's the Labor Department report.
[01:48:04.967 --> 01:48:09.808]  The Labor Department report said 1.07 million jobs in the first six months.
[01:48:09.808 --> 01:48:19.771]  We've also seen the new deals, the companies that are coming in, Carrier refusing to go to Mexico, Foxconn now coming in putting a $10 billion factory in Wisconsin.
[01:48:19.771 --> 01:48:20.691]  This is not fake.
[01:48:20.691 --> 01:48:21.991]  We've all seen it and we're all seeing it.
[01:48:21.991 --> 01:48:29.393]  However, I would suggest, and I think it's a great step in the right direction with these fireside chats, that the story needs to be told better.
[01:48:29.773 --> 01:48:32.516]  I don't want to just see somebody sitting there reporting the news.
[01:48:32.516 --> 01:48:33.537]  I want to actually see these.
[01:48:33.537 --> 01:48:35.679]  Let's start showing these factories being built.
[01:48:35.679 --> 01:48:40.023]  Let's see the President and these leaders of industry signing these deals, signing these agreements.
[01:48:40.023 --> 01:48:41.164]  Show the people what's going on.
[01:48:41.164 --> 01:48:42.585]  Don't just give me a number.
[01:48:42.585 --> 01:48:44.567]  Show me the people going back to work.
[01:48:44.567 --> 01:48:46.048]  Show me the people what's going on.
[01:48:46.048 --> 01:48:51.454]  Let's show, you know, the shovel full of sand down at the border with the wall being built.
[01:48:51.454 --> 01:48:53.796]  I think once the President knows the power of visual
[01:48:54.176 --> 01:48:54.937]  Exactly.
[01:48:54.937 --> 01:49:02.581]  And they're acting like it's dirty and bad and crazy that he would once a week have a program showing their accomplishments as they block on Twitter, drudge.
[01:49:13.007 --> 01:49:16.188]  Showing the jobs numbers from the federal government.
[01:49:16.188 --> 01:49:19.169]  I mean, they're doing everything they can to kill this economy.
[01:49:19.169 --> 01:49:40.855]  Jack Posobiec, let's specifically look here at, because I'm going to play some of this coming up in the next hour after you're gone, of an actual interview that Rich Higgins from the Pentagon brought in by General Flynn about the left's alliance with Islam and the globalists and how it's planned out and how they're working as good cop, bad cop in an overall plan to overthrow our system of government.
[01:49:41.195 --> 01:49:43.957]  And he actually goes through all of it.
[01:49:43.957 --> 01:49:49.021]  And that's what they're so scared of, and that's what McMaster fired him for, because he understands the plan.
[01:49:49.021 --> 01:49:59.088]  One strength the plan has is, it's so dastardly, it's so over-the-top, it's so evil, it's so cunning, that we have trouble even believing it's this ridiculous.
[01:49:59.088 --> 01:50:00.849]  But it's really happening!
[01:50:02.952 --> 01:50:07.454]  And Rich Higgins is someone as well, Alex, who was there as a strategic planner.
[01:50:07.454 --> 01:50:15.817]  His specific job was to look at different things that are going on in the world and try to make sense of it and try to say where it's going to be in 20 years and 30 years.
[01:50:15.817 --> 01:50:25.321]  So he was literally doing his job on the National Security Council and stating, this is what I think the enemy's strategic vision is for the United States.
[01:50:25.321 --> 01:50:28.322]  You can agree with it or disagree with it, but this is how I'm going to write it up.
[01:50:28.996 --> 01:50:33.540]  Why would anyone fire somebody for doing their job when it comes to that sentence?
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:34.621]  He was doing his job.
[01:50:34.621 --> 01:50:37.203]  He shared his memo out with people in the administration.
[01:50:37.203 --> 01:50:39.965]  The minute McMaster found out about it, he got rid of him.
[01:50:39.965 --> 01:50:43.668]  So it seems that he may have been doing his job a little bit too well, Alex.
[01:50:44.167 --> 01:50:49.548]  It's just incredible when I research this and big parts of the interview that's got no play are coming up in the next hour.
[01:50:49.548 --> 01:50:51.169]  Roger Stone's going to pop in as well.
[01:50:51.169 --> 01:51:04.071]  I will open the phones up then but we have just got to look at one more segment with you Posobiec because we just calmly talk about Brennan and all these people talking about removing the president outside of law but through a coup.
[01:51:04.071 --> 01:51:06.312]  How are they going to try this coup and what happens if they do?
[01:51:06.992 --> 01:51:09.294]  At HumaLife, we believe your health is your wealth.

[01:54:16.824 --> 01:54:19.046]  I've got some really good news.
[01:54:19.046 --> 01:54:27.092]  Anti-gun activists face bankruptcy after filing frivolous lawsuits.
[01:54:27.092 --> 01:54:29.713]  Now the good news is they face bankruptcy.
[01:54:29.713 --> 01:54:45.285]  The good news is their lawsuit was thrown out and all the lawsuits are being thrown out against gun manufacturers when somebody on Prozac who illegally gets a gun or another serotonin reuptake inhibitor goes and kills some people
[01:54:46.431 --> 01:54:50.074]  That's not the fault of the gun maker or the gun shop.
[01:54:50.074 --> 01:54:51.715]  They sold the firearm legally.
[01:54:51.715 --> 01:55:00.921]  Just like if a nutball goes and gets a Ford Civic or a Chevy Tahoe and runs over to a crowd of people, do you sue Chevy?
[01:55:00.921 --> 01:55:01.742]  And the shareholders?
[01:55:01.742 --> 01:55:01.882]  No!
[01:55:04.719 --> 01:55:06.702]  Execute the guy that did it, if he did it on purpose.
[01:55:06.702 --> 01:55:07.623]  Or you throw him in prison.
[01:55:07.623 --> 01:55:10.747]  You don't sue the car maker.
[01:55:10.747 --> 01:55:11.668]  That's coming up.
[01:55:11.668 --> 01:55:17.896]  Now, Jack Posobiec, I really, my job is to beat the drum on issues and force them out into consciousness.
[01:55:17.896 --> 01:55:20.018]  This isn't your normal entertainment radio show.
[01:55:20.018 --> 01:55:20.679]  Everybody knows that.
[01:55:20.679 --> 01:55:23.062]  This is an organic...
[01:55:23.743 --> 01:55:30.808]  Patriot, military operation against the globalists, from behind enemy lines, in occupied North America.
[01:55:30.808 --> 01:55:32.970]  We say that, it's not a joke, it's not theatrics.
[01:55:32.970 --> 01:55:40.095]  We still haven't gotten the country back, we've got major beachheads, we've launched major offensives, but we're in the middle of the fight of our lives.
[01:55:40.095 --> 01:55:42.637]  Globally, there's a fight against globalism as well, as you know.
[01:55:42.637 --> 01:55:49.602]  We've got a lot of other fellow patriots around the planet, from Brazil, to the UK, to you name it, to Catalonia, to Russia, fighting the same fight.
[01:55:50.382 --> 01:55:56.926]  But just in closing, they're all over the place saying kill him, overthrow him, remove him, COG, 25th Amendment.
[01:55:56.926 --> 01:55:59.547]  They really are planning to make the move, I believe, soon.
[01:55:59.547 --> 01:56:00.528]  A, do you believe that?
[01:56:00.528 --> 01:56:02.429]  C, how might they do it?
[01:56:02.429 --> 01:56:04.510]  What do we do if they blow his head off?
[01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:06.691]  They're going to try to activate riots nationwide.
[01:56:06.691 --> 01:56:08.832]  I mean, I just can't believe we're in this position.
[01:56:08.832 --> 01:56:12.914]  I think Trump and the Justice Department have to move against him.
[01:56:12.914 --> 01:56:15.476]  Alex, that's their game plan and that's their endgame for all of this.
[01:56:16.144 --> 01:56:25.875]  They want the president to either resign on his own or they're going to try to bring some kind of charges against him, fake charges that are completely without merit.
[01:56:25.875 --> 01:56:28.899]  If they do that, this is not going to be like the 1970s.
[01:56:30.148 --> 01:56:42.941]  This is going to be much, much worse because half of the country has seen, for the past two years, the vilification of this man, a private citizen at first, trying to do the right thing for his country.
[01:56:42.941 --> 01:56:48.026]  The entire establishment of the Beltway, the entire media has gone against him.
[01:56:48.026 --> 01:56:52.370]  If Trump had done something wrong that was that egregious, by now, believe me, Alex, I think we'd know it.
[01:56:53.641 --> 01:56:57.264]  So half of the country knows how hard he is fighting.
[01:56:57.264 --> 01:57:06.191]  That half of the country is not going to slink away quietly if they go to take out the president, whether by physical means or by some kind of legal means.
[01:57:06.191 --> 01:57:07.693]  They're going to be very upset.
[01:57:07.693 --> 01:57:18.362]  They're going to be out in the streets, hopefully peacefully rioting, or excuse me, peacefully protesting, but it would be very hard for them to be quieted if President Trump is taken out like that.
[01:57:19.099 --> 01:57:27.946]  And also they're trying to bully us with boycotts and don't let libertarian or nationalist or conservative groups have e-commerce or websites.
[01:57:27.946 --> 01:57:36.493]  It's time for everyone to look at what they're buying, who they're shopping with, and religiously do not spend money with globalist operations.
[01:57:36.493 --> 01:57:45.981]  Break with it, go through the extra trouble, pay a little more wherever you are to get products you need to not support globalists like Bezos and Amazon.
[01:57:46.947 --> 01:57:55.169]  You know, we got off Amazon a few years ago, even though we were funding ourselves and selling a lot of stuff, because they're just an anti-gun, anti-free speech, anti-American group.
[01:57:55.169 --> 01:57:58.030]  They own the Washington Post, waging war on America.
[01:57:58.030 --> 01:57:59.931]  And, you know, these are enemies.
[01:57:59.931 --> 01:58:01.491]  These are absolute enemies.
[01:58:01.491 --> 01:58:06.092]  But again, pull your money and support from the enemy, and financially support the Liberty Movement.
[01:58:06.092 --> 01:58:08.633]  If we do that as the producers, we will break the enemies back.
[01:58:11.670 --> 01:58:12.310]  Exactly, Alex.
[01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:14.632]  You've got to go to their sources of money.
[01:58:14.632 --> 01:58:17.353]  You've got to go to where their pockets come from.
[01:58:17.353 --> 01:58:18.614]  You know, people say this all the time.
[01:58:18.614 --> 01:58:19.874]  Oh, I've just got a Twitter account.
[01:58:19.874 --> 01:58:20.595]  I've got a Facebook.
[01:58:20.595 --> 01:58:21.615]  What can I do?
[01:58:21.615 --> 01:58:22.556]  We're up against
[01:58:23.086 --> 01:58:24.987]  Billionaires in this thing.
[01:58:24.987 --> 01:58:27.670]  They're putting so many dollars behind this.
[01:58:27.670 --> 01:58:30.312]  They have so many resources at their command.
[01:58:30.312 --> 01:58:32.473]  What they don't have are people.
[01:58:32.473 --> 01:58:36.016]  We have the people on our side, and we have the truth on our side.
[01:58:36.016 --> 01:58:42.781]  And with that ability, with that framework in place, no matter what they throw at us, we are always going to... That's right.
[01:58:42.781 --> 01:58:45.163]  As long as you stay focused and in the fight.
[01:58:45.163 --> 01:58:45.903]  Absolutely.
[01:58:45.903 --> 01:58:48.305]  Jack Posobiec, amazing.
[01:58:48.305 --> 01:58:48.846]  It's the truth.
[01:58:49.526 --> 01:58:51.068]  You are engaging the globalists.
[01:58:51.068 --> 01:58:52.169]  You!
[01:58:52.169 --> 01:58:53.810]  Whether you like it or not.
[01:58:53.810 --> 01:58:54.651]  But it's not work.
[01:58:54.651 --> 01:58:56.073]  Do you feel the electricity?
[01:58:57.984 --> 01:59:04.487]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[01:59:04.487 --> 01:59:17.472]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:59:17.472 --> 01:59:21.133]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:59:21.133 --> 01:59:24.615]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[01:59:24.955 --> 01:59:28.096]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:59:28.096 --> 01:59:40.961]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:59:40.961 --> 01:59:42.522]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:59:42.802 --> 01:59:49.204]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[01:59:53.385 --> 01:59:54.945]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:17.501 --> 02:00:23.751]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.047 --> 02:00:33.588]  Roger Stone's coming up with a lot of breaking news.
[02:00:33.588 --> 02:00:48.376]  I will air large excerpts that really are not getting any coverage of this amazing Rich Higgins who got fired last week, breaking down how globalist Islam is the future world system they're bringing in.
[02:00:48.376 --> 02:00:49.837]  It's just, it's irrefutable.
[02:00:49.837 --> 02:00:51.558]  McMaster is an acolyte of it.
[02:00:51.558 --> 02:00:53.339]  It's a cult of these people.
[02:00:53.339 --> 02:00:55.180]  These are such double-crossers.
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:57.541]  Napoleon joined Islam there at the end as well.
[02:00:58.988 --> 02:01:00.329]  Hitler basically merged with it.
[02:01:00.329 --> 02:01:04.451]  This has been done before, but now the demographics are very, very clear.
[02:01:04.451 --> 02:01:06.433]  So that's all coming up.
[02:01:06.433 --> 02:01:09.054]  You know, there's a sad story up on Infowars.com.
[02:01:09.054 --> 02:01:11.576]  It's a positive story, but also a sad story.
[02:01:11.576 --> 02:01:16.279]  Anti-gun activists face bankruptcy after filing a frivolous lawsuit.
[02:01:16.279 --> 02:01:19.741]  Now, the good news is their fake lawsuits are getting shot down around the country.
[02:01:19.741 --> 02:01:27.646]  The sad thing is, is these people got tricked by Bloomberg to be part of the lawsuit themselves, and then they get hit with the court fees.
[02:01:28.959 --> 02:01:33.562]  Very sad to see Bloomberg manipulating people that have been hurt.
[02:01:33.562 --> 02:01:41.969]  You know, they lost some family in the Aurora shooting and I didn't even know who they were when they confronted me on the street in San Antonio at a pro gun rally I was having.
[02:01:41.969 --> 02:01:45.311]  The media tried to spin it that I was being mean to them.
[02:01:45.311 --> 02:01:47.613]  I mean, he hit his wife in front of me.
[02:01:47.613 --> 02:01:52.116]  It's on camera, hit her and was threatening me and just totally out of control.
[02:01:52.116 --> 02:01:55.779]  And then later I found out who they were and tried to stay away.
[02:01:55.779 --> 02:01:58.221]  But they came into the event I was at
[02:01:59.776 --> 02:02:06.022]  at a restaurant and they were having another event and they thought like I was there to harass them and they just ran over and got in my face.
[02:02:06.022 --> 02:02:14.891]  It's all on video but the anti-gun activists who once confronted Alex Jones are now facing bankruptcy after a judge dismissed their frivolous lawsuit against a gun store.
[02:02:16.192 --> 02:02:31.865]  Lonnie and Sandy Phillips, who faced off with Jones in the 2013 Second Amendment rally in San Antonio, were ordered to pay $200,000 in legal fees to the Lucky Gunner store after a judge threw out their politically motivated lawsuits, which conflicted with federal law.
[02:02:33.902 --> 02:02:38.984]  So again, these Bloomberg push suits are bad news.
[02:02:38.984 --> 02:02:56.412]  The couple were encouraged by the Brady campaign to file a lawsuit against Lucky Gunner, which apparently sold ammunition to the Aurora shooter, James Holmes, who later killed Sandy's daughter, despite the fact that under federal law, business cannot be responsible for the criminal acts of third parties beyond their control if they follow the law.
[02:02:56.412 --> 02:03:00.074]  Lucky Gunner was no more responsible for the actions of James Holmes and
[02:03:01.154 --> 02:03:10.242]  Honda was for the actions of Abdul Razik Ali Artan when he attempted to use his Civic to kill pedestrians at Ohio State University.
[02:03:10.242 --> 02:03:11.603]  This is what the court wrote.
[02:03:11.603 --> 02:03:14.025]  The example I always use.
[02:03:14.025 --> 02:03:27.296]  As is no more deserves punishment, reported the National Review, citing a 2005 Protection of Law, Commerce and Arms Act, there are already consumer protections that make gun manufacturers liable in rare cases when their products malfunction.
[02:03:27.296 --> 02:03:29.218]  Naturally, they do not apply to misuse.
[02:03:29.778 --> 02:03:38.782]  The judge simply followed the law by dismissing the lawsuit and now the felons must reimburse the gun store for having to defend against a suit which never should have been filed.
[02:03:38.782 --> 02:03:48.486]  But again, they run all this stuff like they're invincible and we're going to sue you and we're going to get you and that's what I've learned now with frivolous lawsuits that have been filed on us.
[02:03:48.486 --> 02:03:50.968]  Some of the lawyers involved shot their mouths off in D.C.
[02:03:50.968 --> 02:03:51.568]  at some dinners.
[02:03:52.659 --> 02:03:56.522]  And later we called and said, you know, we now know, you file a suit that's frivolous.
[02:03:56.522 --> 02:03:58.283]  You just want the suit in the news.
[02:03:58.283 --> 02:04:00.545]  Then behind the scenes, they want to settle.
[02:04:00.545 --> 02:04:01.726]  I won't settle.
[02:04:01.726 --> 02:04:04.788]  Then they pay me, but it's kept quiet.
[02:04:04.788 --> 02:04:05.769]  This is how it works.
[02:04:05.769 --> 02:04:11.813]  They pay me a juicy sum to then settle secretly with them.
[02:04:11.813 --> 02:04:12.914]  Not going to say any names.
[02:04:14.977 --> 02:04:16.498]  But boy, that's how this works.
[02:04:16.498 --> 02:04:22.241]  And then I'm like, okay, so now, next time, I mean, these suits are like out of Cracker Jack boxes, folks.
[02:04:22.241 --> 02:04:25.603]  I mean, they are just, lawyers look at it and go, this is absolutely 100%.
[02:04:25.603 --> 02:04:26.624]  This is gonna, they're gonna lose.
[02:04:26.624 --> 02:04:28.965]  You're gonna have to pay attorney's fees.
[02:04:28.965 --> 02:04:30.186]  They're like, we're certain of it.
[02:04:31.081 --> 02:04:33.784]  Unless maybe you have the 9th Circuit on appeal.
[02:04:33.784 --> 02:04:35.566]  But then the Supreme Court will overrule it.
[02:04:35.566 --> 02:04:37.649]  But they go, that's one chance out of whatever.
[02:04:37.649 --> 02:04:41.173]  And then they even try to get us in the 9th Circuit.
[02:04:41.173 --> 02:04:43.856]  It is just unbelievable.
[02:04:43.856 --> 02:04:49.462]  But next time, I now realize I have to show the bandits I'm going to fight back.
[02:04:50.183 --> 02:04:55.990]  Counter-sue everything so they don't get the PR that then runs stories that I'm being sued, I'm fake news.
[02:04:55.990 --> 02:05:03.159]  So, whoever's next up with their lawsuit, step on up for a big giant litigation with me, PIs, and everything else.
[02:05:03.159 --> 02:05:04.241]  Step right up!
[02:05:04.241 --> 02:05:05.002]  Step right up!
[02:05:07.008 --> 02:05:07.488]  Think about it.
[02:05:22.113 --> 02:05:29.458]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[02:05:29.458 --> 02:05:31.239]  It's available at Infomerstore.com.

[02:05:39.565 --> 02:05:40.586]  I want to get your reviews.
[02:05:40.586 --> 02:05:41.546]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:05:41.546 --> 02:05:42.987]  For me, it's been incredible.
[02:05:42.987 --> 02:05:47.530]  MycoZX, antifungal, uh, antifungus, uh, anti-yeast.
[02:05:47.530 --> 02:05:48.350]  Get it today.
[02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.831]  Limited run.

[02:05:50.231 --> 02:05:54.894]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:05:54.894 --> 02:05:58.256]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[02:05:58.256 --> 02:06:00.578]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[02:06:00.578 --> 02:06:01.979]  Look at the response we're getting.
[02:06:01.979 --> 02:06:03.920]  We're changing the world together.
[02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:04.940]  You are the InfoWar.
[02:06:04.940 --> 02:06:05.681]  God bless you all.
[02:06:08.650 --> 02:06:12.413]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:06:12.413 --> 02:06:20.138]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:06:20.138 --> 02:06:28.784]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:06:28.784 --> 02:06:33.186]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:06:33.186 --> 02:06:38.490]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:06:38.610 --> 02:06:39.130]  We're good.
[02:07:07.199 --> 02:07:15.461]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[02:07:15.461 --> 02:07:16.681]  A 360 win.
[02:07:16.681 --> 02:07:23.242]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[02:07:23.242 --> 02:07:30.764]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:07:31.164 --> 02:07:35.848]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:07:35.848 --> 02:07:42.353]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:07:42.353 --> 02:07:50.139]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:07:50.139 --> 02:07:57.344]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:07:57.344 --> 02:07:58.165]  10% off on auto ship.
[02:07:58.325 --> 02:08:00.746]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[02:08:00.746 --> 02:08:02.727]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[02:08:02.727 --> 02:08:15.054]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:08:15.054 --> 02:08:21.298]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:35.928 --> 02:08:46.878]  I tend to start gibbering 100 miles an hour with all this news and not really just pull back and look at the massive import of what we're facing.
[02:08:46.878 --> 02:08:51.823]  Our country had been hijacked by foreign multinational corporations.
[02:08:51.823 --> 02:08:57.328]  They're openly trying to atomize culture where people are leaderless, dumbed down and easily controlled.
[02:08:58.149 --> 02:09:04.990]  They're so arrogant they write countless public policy reports in white papers admitting they're criminal.
[02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:11.371]  It's in the WikiLeaks how they want to make us poor, control our lives, dumb us down.
[02:09:11.371 --> 02:09:20.633]  They are engaged in just so much bizarre garbage that it makes your head spin.
[02:09:26.670 --> 02:09:39.574]  We're just living in such an amazing time in human culture that I don't even know what to say anymore.
[02:09:39.574 --> 02:09:48.016]  And it's just information overload where I've just got stack after stack after stack of the most incredible stories that all
[02:09:49.281 --> 02:10:07.873]  Just detail the lawless, lying, criminal behavior of these people and the fact that they've converted so much of the culture and so much of the society over into this system.
[02:10:07.873 --> 02:10:14.478]  But what you gotta know is the globalists are predatory.
[02:10:14.478 --> 02:10:18.841]  The globalists know full well what they're doing.
[02:10:20.768 --> 02:10:23.129]  And they have a cold-blooded plan.
[02:10:23.129 --> 02:10:40.316]  And they think those of us that aren't sociopaths, or aren't psychopaths, like there's something wrong with us because we don't see that we should dumb people down, and we should be predatory, and we should control populations.
[02:10:40.316 --> 02:10:42.877]  They think there's something wrong with us that we don't join them.
[02:10:42.877 --> 02:10:48.699]  But every time the sociopaths get in control, societies end up collapsing and degenerating.
[02:10:51.104 --> 02:11:10.555]  Now, Roger Stone's coming up in a little while, but first, because I mentioned this, I wanted to play some clips of Rich Higgins describing what's happening inside DC.
[02:11:12.327 --> 02:11:16.708]  and the struggle in political warfare in America.
[02:11:16.708 --> 02:11:26.851]  Then we're going to play his description of PC culture inside Washington, which is total social control, so you can't fight back against the groups taking over.
[02:11:26.851 --> 02:11:31.233]  Rich Higgins talks about the true repercussions of the terror attacks.
[02:11:31.233 --> 02:11:37.395]  He talks about so much more.
[02:11:37.395 --> 02:11:38.455]  So these are some key clips.
[02:11:38.455 --> 02:11:39.775]  I want to play the first one.
[02:11:39.775 --> 02:11:41.176]  Rich Higgins, formerly the Pentagon,
[02:11:43.615 --> 02:11:58.059]  High-level national security advisor to the president, fired for penning a memo about globalism, allied with radical Islam, and using the terror attacks as a way to get us to politically submit to Islam.
[02:11:58.059 --> 02:12:07.621]  And then to direct wars against radical Islam's foes, secular countries like Syria, like Iraq.
[02:12:08.996 --> 02:12:15.181]  And of course, like Libya, and Egypt, and then putting things a hundred times worse in.
[02:12:15.181 --> 02:12:16.382]  This is the plan.
[02:12:16.382 --> 02:12:26.331]  Then turn that Islamic force against Europe, bring it in, and then have Europe get rid of free speech in the name of submitting, you know, to Islam so they stop killing us.
[02:12:26.331 --> 02:12:35.359]  Because you can say, you know, the terror attack, still statistically more people drown, more people are shot, okay, a lot of Muslims are killing us, what's the big deal?
[02:12:35.359 --> 02:12:36.500]  The violent response
[02:12:37.793 --> 02:12:45.975]  He's the cover for the political operations that are going on, and he points that out, not letting you have pork in schools.
[02:12:45.975 --> 02:12:48.156]  You can argue, well, pork's not healthy, so what?
[02:12:48.156 --> 02:12:50.116]  It's not that, it's that they call the shots.
[02:12:50.116 --> 02:12:51.636]  Who made them God?
[02:12:51.636 --> 02:12:56.398]  Okay, no pork at the school lunches in Australia and Europe and in areas here.
[02:12:56.398 --> 02:13:01.199]  Okay, now you can't build synagogues because the Muslims are protesting it.
[02:13:01.199 --> 02:13:04.860]  Since when did you get in that position in Europe and in Australia and other areas?
[02:13:05.993 --> 02:13:09.494]  It's like they're the protected special group.
[02:13:09.494 --> 02:13:10.774]  That's why this is so important.
[02:13:10.774 --> 02:13:13.175]  So here's the first clip of Rich Higgins.
[02:13:13.175 --> 02:13:15.216]  There's only one interview with this guy from Daily Caller.
[02:13:15.216 --> 02:13:17.816]  We're playing parts of it with credit here, obviously.
[02:13:17.816 --> 02:13:21.697]  We're going to get him on the next few weeks as soon as he's done with his wedding he's having.
[02:13:21.697 --> 02:13:23.498]  But let's go ahead and go to Rich Higgins.
[02:13:23.498 --> 02:13:23.778]  Here it is.
[02:13:25.516 --> 02:13:33.785]  The day of the Orlando attacks at the Pulse nightclub, my sister-in-law, who's from Florida originally, called me up.
[02:13:33.785 --> 02:13:37.389]  She had friends who had hung out there in years previously.
[02:13:37.389 --> 02:13:44.077]  And for the second time, she now lives in Boston, for the second time she had been touched by terrorism directly.
[02:13:45.077 --> 02:13:45.517]  We're good to go.
[02:14:04.156 --> 02:14:20.690]  I recognize that I do have a unique vantage point from the positions I've occupied in the past and my skill baseline to go forward and hopefully provide for the public and really our policy makers and our politicians an alternative approach.
[02:14:21.485 --> 02:14:25.168]  So why are you coming forward now to talk about this?
[02:14:25.168 --> 02:14:27.689]  And why do you care?
[02:14:27.689 --> 02:14:32.593]  2016, from the enemy's strategic vantage point, is a pivot year.
[02:14:32.593 --> 02:14:45.161]  What we've seen in San Bernardino and Orlando just this morning, the statistics, in 2016, 1,200 people have been killed outside of Iraq and Syria by operations ISIS is conducting.
[02:14:45.161 --> 02:14:50.645]  We're going to continue to see the growth in their kinetic attacks.
[02:14:51.545 --> 02:14:57.967]  And I think our fixation on the Connecticut attacks draws us away from the strategic perspective we actually have to this.
[02:14:57.967 --> 02:15:04.310]  Understanding there's a political apparatus behind what's actually transpiring in the world.
[02:15:04.310 --> 02:15:15.974]  Because of the death, because of the carnage, because of the media coverage associated with it, it draws us to fixate on particular points that may or may not lead us to the correct strategic conclusions.
[02:15:17.074 --> 02:15:34.246]  And I think it's really important to come forward with folks who understand political warfare, who understand the emphasis behind these attacks, the ideological drivers, the political drivers, the social drivers, to actually formulate policy solutions and strategy solutions.
[02:15:34.246 --> 02:15:39.990]  Where we've lost this war is where we've failed to actually develop a strategy.
[02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:42.052]  And I think 15 years into the war,
[02:15:42.944 --> 02:15:48.086]  With the political space created by the election, it's time to at least have the discussion.
[02:15:48.086 --> 02:15:51.487]  To take that operational pause and re-look at what we're doing.
[02:15:51.487 --> 02:15:54.388]  Because what we have been doing is just not working.
[02:15:54.388 --> 02:16:00.210]  Political warfare is non-violent and violent actions operating in synthesis.
[02:16:00.210 --> 02:16:03.931]  So the terror attack is done for the purpose of making you afraid.
[02:16:04.631 --> 02:16:06.874]  And when you are afraid, you are controlled.
[02:16:06.874 --> 02:16:08.276]  You can be controlled.
[02:16:08.276 --> 02:16:09.878]  You're willing to give away your own freedoms.
[02:16:09.878 --> 02:16:11.620]  You're willing to give away your own rights.
[02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:20.290]  And so, political warfare has to be understood and the goal of the attack in Orlando was not the death of those Americans.
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:23.261]  Or the wounding of those Americans.
[02:16:23.261 --> 02:16:29.803]  The goal of the attack on Orlando is to put fear into Americans so that you would be willing to give up some of your rights.
[02:16:29.803 --> 02:16:33.324]  So that you might be able to accept limits on free speech.
[02:16:33.324 --> 02:16:36.385]  So that you might be willing to limit guns.
[02:16:36.385 --> 02:16:40.847]  Again, it's not by accident that those things are targeted.
[02:16:40.847 --> 02:16:46.769]  The left again enabling, I see the left is almost enabling the enemy in these situations.
[02:16:46.769 --> 02:16:50.290]  But they had the secondary purpose there of the political protection.
[02:16:51.230 --> 02:16:56.252]  Not everything in the war on terrorism is kinetic.
[02:16:56.252 --> 02:16:57.373]  We fixate.
[02:16:57.373 --> 02:16:58.233]  We Westerners.
[02:16:58.233 --> 02:17:03.856]  I think it has something to do with our affinity for guns and Westerns.
[02:17:03.856 --> 02:17:05.897]  We appreciate that culturally.
[02:17:06.770 --> 02:17:17.292]  So when we think about the enemy in the war on terrorism, we think about the guy carrying the AK-47 or we think about the guy carrying the suicide bomber vest.
[02:17:17.292 --> 02:17:28.475]  We don't think about the subversive who is working at a school that is revising texts or curriculum informing future U.S.
[02:17:28.475 --> 02:17:29.195]  government leaders.
[02:17:30.055 --> 02:17:38.703]  And it's getting people to understand this threat at the ideological and political level that has been the greatest challenge, I believe, in the war.
[02:17:38.703 --> 02:17:42.507]  And see, the Pentagon now understands what the globalists are doing.
[02:17:42.507 --> 02:17:53.918]  They bring in radical Muslims, they let them attack, then the police state comes in and takes the general public's rights, but accelerates bringing more Muslims in and says, we have to change so they don't attack us anymore.
[02:17:55.933 --> 02:18:00.368]  And that's the one-two punch, and that's what the EU has officially done, betraying Europe.
[02:18:01.977 --> 02:18:14.247]  Advertising open borders, advertising free welfare, giving preferential treatment to the illegal migrants, and then creating this sad story about, oh, they're mainly children when 80-plus percent are military-age men.
[02:18:14.247 --> 02:18:18.050]  There's powerful video of North Africans pouring into Europe.
[02:18:18.050 --> 02:18:19.712]  You don't see any women, any children.
[02:18:19.712 --> 02:18:24.255]  It's wild footage on Infowars.com right now.
[02:18:24.255 --> 02:18:25.496]  It's over-the-top footage.
[02:18:26.517 --> 02:18:40.416]  Joining us is Roger Stone with breaking news on the isolation of the president, the open push for coup d'etat, the launch of his own media system called Real News that has the media freaking out.
[02:18:40.416 --> 02:18:40.997]  Roger Stone.
[02:18:42.546 --> 02:18:44.026]  Alex, great to be with you.
[02:18:44.026 --> 02:18:59.751]  You know, I'm still trying to digest everything we talked about last week, but I am convinced that the three generals who now are in the top circle around the president are seeking to isolate him totally.
[02:18:59.751 --> 02:19:06.073]  It's kind of a death march to walk him towards the ultimate execution by Robert Mueller.
[02:19:06.773 --> 02:19:24.181]  The president is probably relieved that the chaos that existed under Reince Priebus of the Oval Office being an open door, kind of like the Marx Brothers stateroom scene, I can understand why the president would be relieved.
[02:19:24.181 --> 02:19:31.485]  But now we are at a juncture where they seek to cut off old friends, political allies, friends from business.
[02:19:32.085 --> 02:19:39.750]  Friends from the world of finance, friends from the president's past, and people that he talks to.
[02:19:39.750 --> 02:19:44.013]  They are really seeking to tighten the cordon.
[02:19:44.013 --> 02:19:53.679]  And by the way, after you reported this last Friday, Kelly was in the news that evening saying, I control everyone that gets to see him, even his family.
[02:19:53.679 --> 02:19:59.583]  Let's discuss what this isolation means straight ahead, because if they bring Trump down, folks, they're going after everybody.
[02:20:00.163 --> 02:20:02.866]  Understand, they know we're winning culturally.
[02:20:02.866 --> 02:20:04.727]  They want to bring in authoritarianism.
[02:20:04.727 --> 02:20:06.909]  Let's talk about how we stop them straight ahead.
[02:20:06.909 --> 02:20:08.350]  I ordered some Andro 400.
[02:20:08.350 --> 02:20:11.273]  I'm losing weight around the belly really quickly.
[02:20:11.273 --> 02:20:14.215]  Some of the pants that didn't fit me, now they're falling off my hips.
[02:20:14.215 --> 02:20:17.358]  There's been a noticeable increase in energy.
[02:20:17.358 --> 02:20:18.399]  Then this stuff works.
[02:20:18.399 --> 02:20:19.079]  It does work.
[02:20:19.079 --> 02:20:22.782]  That's what Bill said after taking Andro 400 for a month.
[02:20:22.782 --> 02:20:25.044]  Now listen to what Richard says about Andro 400.
[02:20:25.905 --> 02:20:31.486]  I did a lot of research on it before I ordered it because I've tried other products in the past and they haven't worked.
[02:20:31.486 --> 02:20:34.487]  But I could not believe the difference literally within a month.
[02:20:34.487 --> 02:20:37.528]  Since I started taking it, I have lost 37 pounds.
[02:20:37.528 --> 02:20:38.488]  It was the belly fat.
[02:20:38.488 --> 02:20:40.709]  I could get weight off, but I could never get the tummy off.
[02:20:40.709 --> 02:20:44.210]  Now the tummy's coming off and I have more energy than I've had in 20 years.
[02:20:45.350 --> 02:20:52.256]  If you too want to lose belly fat, gain energy, and feel 20 years younger like Richard, try Andro 400.
[02:20:52.256 --> 02:20:56.180]  The safe, natural, and affordable way to boost your testosterone.

[02:21:06.329 --> 02:21:09.890]  If you had purchased $100 of Bitcoin in 2010, today you'd have $2,600,000.
[02:21:09.890 --> 02:21:18.694]  While that sinks in, you now have a huge cryptocurrency opportunity at below market price at a guaranteed $0.10 per coin.

[02:22:05.617 --> 02:22:06.637]  It's been said.
[02:22:06.637 --> 02:22:10.079]  Any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[02:22:10.079 --> 02:22:11.680]  Those times may be near.
[02:22:11.680 --> 02:22:12.580]  Think about it.
[02:22:12.580 --> 02:22:17.203]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[02:22:17.203 --> 02:22:21.845]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[02:22:22.185 --> 02:22:27.988]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[02:22:27.988 --> 02:22:34.692]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[02:22:34.692 --> 02:22:37.254]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[02:22:37.694 --> 02:22:40.496]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[02:23:11.815 --> 02:23:14.636]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[02:23:24.740 --> 02:23:26.181]  Or warm and served.

[02:23:38.166 --> 02:23:46.211]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[02:24:00.881 --> 02:24:01.501]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[02:24:09.993 --> 02:24:13.375]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got big breaking news.
[02:24:13.375 --> 02:24:22.282]  I know last week, the DOJ said they were looking at releasing emails that they had said did not previously exist under Loretta Lynch's tenure.
[02:24:22.282 --> 02:24:26.965]  Remember, she said, there's no emails between me and the Clintons, no discussions of anything.
[02:24:26.965 --> 02:24:30.207]  I've never talked to the Clintons on email.
[02:24:30.207 --> 02:24:33.049]  Never talked to the State Department when Hillary was there.
[02:24:33.049 --> 02:24:35.011]  Oh, DOJ releases 400 plus pages
[02:24:37.344 --> 02:24:42.365]  Of Lynch-Clinton meeting emails, and reportedly that's just the headers!
[02:24:42.365 --> 02:24:44.786]  That's just an index of the emails.
[02:24:44.786 --> 02:24:48.007]  So we're talking thousands of pages.
[02:24:48.007 --> 02:24:51.448]  This is a smoking gun, but they don't... Smoking guns come out every day!
[02:24:51.448 --> 02:24:54.209]  Total lying, total criminality, totally insane.
[02:24:54.209 --> 02:24:56.749]  That's why they're so desperate to get Trump.
[02:24:56.749 --> 02:24:59.310]  Because they know everything they said he's done, they've done.
[02:24:59.310 --> 02:25:02.091]  And you've got Mueller with this giant dragnet.
[02:25:03.556 --> 02:25:05.358]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[02:25:05.358 --> 02:25:06.819]  This is just huge.
[02:25:06.819 --> 02:25:08.500]  Roger Stone.
[02:25:08.500 --> 02:25:13.084]  Well, Alex, I really think the focus now has to be on the generals.
[02:25:13.084 --> 02:25:23.352]  General McMaster has conducted a purge of Trump loyalists inside the NSA.
[02:25:23.352 --> 02:25:30.778]  He has put in charge, as the number two, a woman named Allison Nielsen, whose job at Homeland Security, where she was number two,
[02:25:31.618 --> 02:25:32.079]  I think?
[02:25:52.734 --> 02:26:03.206]  We'll be honored unless all three of them sign off the usurpation of entire civilian authority.
[02:26:03.206 --> 02:26:12.096]  And I don't believe that the statement the president put out has been seen correctly and in the right light.
[02:26:13.017 --> 02:26:21.002]  I immediately began to question whether the President had in fact seen the statement, given that he was in New Jersey and that it was issued from New York.
[02:26:21.002 --> 02:26:25.485]  I now know the President was misled into approving a statement.
[02:26:25.485 --> 02:26:32.290]  He was simply told that some have attacked McMasters for being anti-Israel.
[02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:35.572]  And as you know, Mr. President, he loves Israel.
[02:26:35.572 --> 02:26:50.722]  Without mentioning that Mr. McMaster's recently said that Ann, that pardon me, Susan Rice had done nothing whatsoever wrong in her unmasking of sensitive surveillance material for political purposes.
[02:26:51.602 --> 02:26:58.127]  Political espionage and extending her national security clearance.
[02:26:58.127 --> 02:27:08.936]  These were two facts that my sources tell me the president was not aware of when he issued his hearty support for Mr. McMaster.
[02:27:08.936 --> 02:27:11.858]  So this is disconcerting.
[02:27:11.858 --> 02:27:14.700]  I say let Trump be Trump.
[02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:19.204]  I say that the idea that he is incontinent or needs a handle
[02:27:19.904 --> 02:27:20.505]  I don't know.
[02:27:36.348 --> 02:27:45.416]  The President's Twitter feed is his province, isn't being written by some punk staffer or some, you know, military guy.
[02:27:45.416 --> 02:27:54.583]  This is Donald Trump's lifeline to the American people and the General, I think, may have made a mistake in his efforts to attempt to close it.
[02:27:54.583 --> 02:28:00.067]  That is powerful information because he was in the news being quoted talking about Trump like he was some
[02:28:01.109 --> 02:28:05.972]  You know, mentally retarded kid that you have to keep in the basement.
[02:28:05.972 --> 02:28:08.193]  Very sickening, arrogant statements.
[02:28:08.193 --> 02:28:09.574]  And I wasn't sure Kelly said it.
[02:28:09.574 --> 02:28:15.217]  I mean, CNN lies so much that either Kelly said that or he didn't say it, but regardless...
[02:28:16.374 --> 02:28:26.417]  Implying that the President was being isolated for his own good and saying that he was no longer going to be on his Twitter alone, but would run it past Kelly.
[02:28:26.417 --> 02:28:36.821]  Again, I mean, these people are arrogant, just like McMaster would run around and say, we're going to topple Assad a day after Trump said that we weren't going to topple Assad, and then he had to walk that back later.
[02:28:36.821 --> 02:28:38.742]  These people are like whack-a-mole.
[02:28:38.742 --> 02:28:39.842]  They keep popping up.
[02:28:40.302 --> 02:28:45.328]  Like bad kids just to see if they can score points with the mainstream media.
[02:28:45.328 --> 02:28:48.751]  Who wants to score points with this dying dinosaur edifice?
[02:28:49.656 --> 02:29:03.699]  Well, and let's face it, when Congressman Adam Bull Schiff comes forward to heartily endorse the leadership of Henry McMaster, of, pardon me, of General McMaster, I think that tells us all we need to know.
[02:29:03.699 --> 02:29:05.900]  The globalists stick together.
[02:29:05.900 --> 02:29:11.801]  McMaster is allied with the other two generals for, this is seven days in May.
[02:29:12.501 --> 02:29:26.605]  This is an effort to lull the president to sleep, cut him off from his most loyal supporters, withhold the truth from him about his government, try to deter him from doing any damage before they can take him out.
[02:29:26.605 --> 02:29:35.547]  Take him out, in this case, defined as walking him slowly to the gallows that are being constructed by Robert Mueller.
[02:29:35.547 --> 02:29:41.409]  Of course, seven days in May was a Hollywood piece, basically the same year as
[02:29:42.702 --> 02:29:52.368]  Dr. Strangelove came out dealing with the same type of out-of-control rogue generals in Deep State starting a nuclear war.
[02:29:52.368 --> 02:29:55.850]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more with Roger Stone.
[02:29:55.850 --> 02:29:56.291]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:56.291 --> 02:29:57.451]  We're on the march.
[02:29:57.451 --> 02:29:59.993]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:59.993 --> 02:30:02.655]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:08.323 --> 02:30:09.724]  Why is the fungus?
[02:30:09.724 --> 02:30:10.805]  Why is the mold?
[02:30:10.805 --> 02:30:12.546]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[02:30:12.546 --> 02:30:13.527]  What is going on?
[02:30:13.527 --> 02:30:14.287]  What has changed?
[02:30:38.583 --> 02:30:40.004]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[02:30:40.004 --> 02:30:41.025]  I want to get your reviews.
[02:30:41.025 --> 02:30:41.985]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:30:41.985 --> 02:30:43.446]  For me, it's been incredible.
[02:30:43.446 --> 02:30:47.969]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[02:30:47.969 --> 02:30:48.689]  Get it today.
[02:30:48.689 --> 02:30:49.289]  Limited run.
[02:30:49.289 --> 02:30:50.690]  It'll be months till we get more.
[02:30:50.690 --> 02:30:55.353]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:30:55.353 --> 02:30:58.695]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[02:30:58.695 --> 02:31:01.016]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[02:31:01.016 --> 02:31:02.917]  Look at the response we're getting.
[02:31:02.917 --> 02:31:04.378]  We're changing the world together.
[02:31:04.378 --> 02:31:05.398]  You are the Infowar.
[02:31:05.398 --> 02:31:06.139]  God bless you all.
[02:31:07.688 --> 02:31:16.780]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:31:16.780 --> 02:31:24.871]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:25.171 --> 02:31:30.034]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:31:30.034 --> 02:31:36.839]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:36.839 --> 02:31:44.004]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:44.004 --> 02:31:51.028]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:51.028 --> 02:31:54.971]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:31:55.111 --> 02:32:06.257]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:32:06.257 --> 02:32:07.818]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:32:20.305 --> 02:32:23.168]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[02:32:23.168 --> 02:32:24.650]  It's made in the USA.
[02:32:24.650 --> 02:32:31.498]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:32:31.498 --> 02:32:33.580]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:32:33.580 --> 02:32:35.262]  This is the formula that I personally
[02:32:35.282 --> 02:32:35.722]  We're good to go.
[02:33:04.983 --> 02:33:06.804]  Now I don't watch a great deal of Fox.
[02:33:28.029 --> 02:33:36.436]  When I'm on the elliptical in the morning, usually 30 minutes, I'll watch a little bit of that, then I'll listen to music when I'm lifting weights for another 30, 45 minutes.
[02:33:36.436 --> 02:33:46.704]  And then we have monitors on basically in five different areas of the office that have CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN, Fox, and we kind of monitor it.
[02:33:46.704 --> 02:33:51.788]  But every time I turn Fox on, if it's not Sean Hannity or Tucker Carlson,
[02:33:53.334 --> 02:33:56.036]  They are just backhanded attacking the president.
[02:33:56.036 --> 02:33:57.857]  Oh, he's lazy, didn't get anything done.
[02:33:57.857 --> 02:33:59.198]  Oh, but it doesn't matter.
[02:33:59.198 --> 02:34:01.279]  He just says, you know, he hates the media.
[02:34:01.279 --> 02:34:02.360]  He's a one-trick pony.
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:03.841]  Ha ha ha.
[02:34:03.841 --> 02:34:04.681]  It's bad.
[02:34:04.681 --> 02:34:07.563]  And you can see the people do not like what they're saying.
[02:34:07.563 --> 02:34:11.785]  They do not like the talking points they've been given because it's suiciding the ratings.
[02:34:11.785 --> 02:34:15.388]  Now, we first reported back in July they were going to get rid of Roger Ailes in a coup.
[02:34:15.928 --> 02:34:19.610]  The brothers were, because they want to sell Sky News for $40-something million.
[02:34:19.610 --> 02:34:26.473]  And in the UK, they won't allow that sale to go through if it's involved in hate anywhere else in the world.
[02:34:26.473 --> 02:34:27.373]  And a bunch of other stuff.
[02:34:27.373 --> 02:34:29.895]  But they've gotten on board.
[02:34:29.895 --> 02:34:31.115]  They think they're going to beat Trump.
[02:34:31.115 --> 02:34:33.336]  They think they're going to beat the nationalism.
[02:34:33.336 --> 02:34:35.137]  They think they're going to beat Make America Great Again.
[02:34:35.137 --> 02:34:39.039]  They think they're going to get their carbon tax and their open borders because they're committed to it.
[02:34:39.739 --> 02:34:43.082]  And they're classically in ivory towers in their own world.
[02:34:43.082 --> 02:35:00.498]  You read Ministry of Defense, Pentagon analysis, others, they say populism is going to take over, renaissance is going to explode back, but then there's going to be big wars because of AI, overpopulation, there is overpopulation in many areas of the world because we've not allowed clean industry to come in.
[02:35:00.498 --> 02:35:05.103]  Currently we're overpopulated in the many areas and it's just going to be just an absolute bloodbath.
[02:35:05.925 --> 02:35:15.850]  So we're going to defeat modern globalism and the plan of David Rockefeller and the UN and their family and this corporate idea to loot everybody, but we're still left with a bunch of problems.
[02:35:15.850 --> 02:35:18.371]  It's not like we're offering some utopia.
[02:35:18.371 --> 02:35:21.273]  And so Roger Stone is our guest.
[02:35:21.273 --> 02:35:29.697]  He brought a clip to my attention of this pundit on Fox News saying, oh, well, Kelly's real measure will be, can he stop
[02:35:31.323 --> 02:35:33.364]  Alex Jones' information from getting the president.
[02:35:33.364 --> 02:35:41.108]  Because, see, they've gone from, oh, look, the president's crazy, he gets Alex Jones' info, to trying to ignore that and just hope it goes away.
[02:35:41.108 --> 02:35:42.228]  Well, let me explain something.
[02:35:42.228 --> 02:35:48.731]  The only reason the president's listened to me on occasion is common sense.
[02:35:48.731 --> 02:35:51.793]  Before he was president, they just stole the nomination from
[02:35:53.530 --> 02:35:56.192]  Bernie Sanders, even though he won all the states, they're going to steal it from you.
[02:35:56.192 --> 02:36:05.478]  And there's some memos that have been put out by the Democrats who are talking about wanting to federalize elections to stop the Republicans from ever, you know, becoming the dominant party.
[02:36:05.478 --> 02:36:08.840]  And then you give people the info, the Democrats are talking about it.
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:16.025]  Obviously Trump listened, went and checked the numbers of 3 point whatever million illegals voting in the last election.
[02:36:16.025 --> 02:36:17.146]  He brought all that out.
[02:36:17.146 --> 02:36:18.467]  It's all been proven correct.
[02:36:19.227 --> 02:36:29.738]  So that's what they can't stand, is the fact that I communicate with the President through you communicating with him on Twitter, through you at the rallies, through people close to the President.
[02:36:29.738 --> 02:36:30.739]  I'll just leave it that way.
[02:36:31.730 --> 02:36:47.944]  They can't stand it, and they want Hannity off just because, more than anybody, one hour a night, if he's not giving a speech or whatever, or he has them DVR it, when he gets back at midnight, he gets out the popcorn and turns on Sean Hannity.
[02:36:47.944 --> 02:36:49.646]  Major bromance going on forever.
[02:36:51.516 --> 02:36:56.701]  Kennedy's talking about all the coup and murder the president and foe, because the globalists are saying it.
[02:36:56.701 --> 02:37:08.892]  So they want to prepare their coup, talk about 25th Amendment, talk about killing him, talk about blowing up the White House, and then not have us talk about it on forums that get to the president, so they can organize all their people and normalize it.
[02:37:09.841 --> 02:37:17.443]  But then separately, they don't want us warning the President, oh hey, five times this week, Clapper says he wants you to be overthrown.
[02:37:17.443 --> 02:37:19.384]  Oh look, you know, on and on and on.
[02:37:19.384 --> 02:37:24.506]  Oh, Al Gore just bragged on the Late Late Show that you're about to be overthrown.
[02:37:24.506 --> 02:37:30.448]  So, that's why they had the Washington Post a month ago saying Hannity has now got into Alex Jones territory.
[02:37:30.448 --> 02:37:31.768]  Look, he's crazy.
[02:37:31.768 --> 02:37:36.169]  He claims there's a plan for COG to overthrow, he got it from Alex.
[02:37:36.169 --> 02:37:37.990]  And then they don't show that it was an Atlantic Monthly.
[02:37:39.065 --> 02:37:41.466]  So, he didn't get it from me.
[02:37:41.466 --> 02:37:42.486]  This is going on.
[02:37:42.486 --> 02:37:44.426]  Lou Dobbs, Rush Limbaugh, all of us.
[02:37:44.426 --> 02:37:45.566]  Yes, it's true.
[02:37:45.566 --> 02:37:48.387]  Have Alex Jones and Roger Stone and all of us trailblazed this?
[02:37:48.387 --> 02:37:49.147]  Yes.
[02:37:49.147 --> 02:37:51.568]  Don't you think we're a little tired of being the trailblazers?
[02:37:51.568 --> 02:37:52.968]  You know how dangerous this is.
[02:37:52.968 --> 02:37:54.869]  They already tried to kill Roger twice.
[02:37:54.869 --> 02:37:58.169]  I'm not going to get into the stuff going on behind the scenes here, but let me just tell you something.
[02:37:58.169 --> 02:38:04.571]  If I wasn't somebody, I'm not into abuse, but if somebody's going to do it, I can flip a switch and like it.
[02:38:04.571 --> 02:38:05.011]  You understand?
[02:38:06.191 --> 02:38:08.533]  I get my energy off them trying to destroy me.
[02:38:08.533 --> 02:38:09.174]  You understand?
[02:38:09.174 --> 02:38:10.175]  I'm committed.
[02:38:10.175 --> 02:38:11.015]  In fact, I love it.
[02:38:11.015 --> 02:38:11.696]  You understand?
[02:38:11.696 --> 02:38:12.837]  I flip the switch.
[02:38:12.837 --> 02:38:14.718]  So they need to understand that I love all of it.
[02:38:14.718 --> 02:38:15.999]  I absolutely enjoy it.
[02:38:15.999 --> 02:38:17.280]  I'm not just putting a good face on it.
[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:17.941]  I love it!
[02:38:17.941 --> 02:38:19.562]  Whatever you do!
[02:38:19.562 --> 02:38:21.344]  Because you're gonna be defeated.
[02:38:21.344 --> 02:38:23.045]  And we're winning the culture war.
[02:38:23.045 --> 02:38:26.148]  And now you can't carry out your little assassination or whatever.
[02:38:26.528 --> 02:38:30.809]  Or hit him with some drugs and claim he had a collapse, a mental issue, put him on PCP.
[02:38:30.809 --> 02:38:44.214]  Whatever it is you're planning, don't think we don't know, and don't think you're ever going to get away with it, McMaster and Brennan and all you dirty collaborator Benedict Arnolds that sold us out to radical Islam.
[02:38:44.214 --> 02:38:50.636]  Don't ever, I'm sorry Roger, I'm ranting, but you brought up this clip, I hadn't seen it, I watched it during the break and it made me get angry again.
[02:38:50.956 --> 02:38:52.379]  But it shows how weak they are.
[02:38:52.379 --> 02:39:02.075]  If they're afraid of us and are fighting around the clock desperately to keep our information from getting to the president, it shows what weak crap they are.
[02:39:02.075 --> 02:39:04.559]  Not how strong we are, but how weak they are!
[02:39:06.189 --> 02:39:09.390]  Well, Alex, I think it's a two-pronged strategy.
[02:39:09.390 --> 02:39:26.017]  One is to try to cut off all access to the President so that he doesn't watch InfoWars, doesn't read Breitbart, doesn't see the Daily Caller, isn't watching Town Hall and a dozen of other sites that he did avidly follow during the campaign.
[02:39:26.017 --> 02:39:30.199]  So he's on a steady diet of Fox and CNN and the three networks.
[02:39:31.140 --> 02:39:44.639]  Fox is probably where he gets most of his information and if he's watching Judge Jeanine or Sean Hannity or Judge Napolitano or Tucker Carlson or Steve Doocy, he's getting it straight.
[02:39:46.168 --> 02:39:50.893]  Otherwise, you're right, the complexion of Fox is changing quickly.
[02:39:50.893 --> 02:40:06.507]  By limiting the print media that he sees and swiftly curtailing his television viewing so that it does not include alternative media, it's much easier to control his perception of things.
[02:40:06.507 --> 02:40:08.348]  As I've said a hundred times on this program,
[02:40:09.309 --> 02:40:13.691]  When Donald Trump has all the information, he almost invariably makes the right decision.
[02:40:13.691 --> 02:40:16.071]  I think you've said it 200 times, and let me add this.
[02:40:16.071 --> 02:40:17.812]  You've been saying this for months.
[02:40:17.812 --> 02:40:20.913]  Kelly and others have tipped their hat, their hand.
[02:40:20.913 --> 02:40:24.414]  They're on TV saying, we're getting him totally isolated.
[02:40:24.414 --> 02:40:27.895]  Now some people say, well that's the leaks, so they can find who the leakers are.
[02:40:27.895 --> 02:40:29.536]  Maybe Kelly's good, maybe he is.
[02:40:30.356 --> 02:40:32.177]  All I know is McMaster's bad.
[02:40:32.177 --> 02:40:34.339]  Mattis, I don't know what's going on.
[02:40:34.339 --> 02:40:36.540]  And we're going to see if the leaks stop.
[02:40:36.540 --> 02:40:39.022]  That shows Kelly's good.
[02:40:39.022 --> 02:40:41.063]  Or maybe the media is misquoting Kelly.
[02:40:41.063 --> 02:40:48.428]  Regardless here, regardless, all I'm saying is that it's true he was being spied on.
[02:40:48.428 --> 02:40:50.329]  It's true they're trying to overthrow him.
[02:40:50.329 --> 02:40:51.370]  And he needs to know this.
[02:40:51.370 --> 02:40:52.650]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:40:52.650 --> 02:40:54.151]  Alex, let's be absolutely clear.
[02:40:54.151 --> 02:40:59.195]  When they talk about finding the leakers and closing the leaks, this is folly.
[02:41:00.195 --> 02:41:02.097]  No president has ever been able to do that.
[02:41:02.097 --> 02:41:05.260]  They will run cursory investigations.
[02:41:05.260 --> 02:41:11.907]  They're going to find that the people in government who leak are strategic enough not to use their own cell phones or emails.
[02:41:11.907 --> 02:41:19.014]  They're not going to leave traces that for which in some cases are crimes in which they could be prosecuted.
[02:41:19.014 --> 02:41:22.678]  Then what will happen is the government will start using surveillance and
[02:41:23.098 --> 02:41:27.100]  He's dropping to try to catch the leakers before they leave.
[02:41:27.100 --> 02:41:32.463]  And it'll be that surveillance that Deep State actually uses to stir up stuff and twist things to burn POTUS.
[02:41:32.463 --> 02:41:40.907]  Well, or even worse, it is precisely what ended up bringing President Nixon down.
[02:41:40.907 --> 02:41:43.388]  It will now be used to use Trump down.
[02:41:43.388 --> 02:41:46.809]  Oh my God, Trump was surveilling his own staff, in all honesty.
[02:41:46.809 --> 02:41:51.792]  The fact that we even need to put members of the White House staff under surveillance
[02:41:52.392 --> 02:41:56.873]  Tells you that they have had poor hiring practices.
[02:41:56.873 --> 02:42:00.233]  This should be the ultimate team of Trump loyalists.
[02:42:00.233 --> 02:42:10.355]  But as you said, day one, they put in sheep-dipped, globalist Soros operatives at all the gatekeeping points to put in the fifth column.
[02:42:10.355 --> 02:42:11.075]  It's very sad.
[02:42:11.075 --> 02:42:13.996]  I mean, the president is like a captive in a tower.
[02:42:13.996 --> 02:42:20.837]  His instinct is good, his heart is pure, and when he gives orders on the economy and they're carried out, we see the results.
[02:42:21.417 --> 02:42:49.452]  He's being told things selectively so they can, in my opinion, lull him to sleep about the danger of Mueller and what he has in store, and to try to mute his corporate tax cut back to something meaningless, to stall as long as they can on the wall, and otherwise just run the clock out hoping that the Democrats take the House in 2018 and then anything Mueller dishes up
[02:42:52.995 --> 02:43:00.984]  Roger, my life is so exciting, is so incredible.
[02:43:00.984 --> 02:43:03.927]  People think being politically aware is like work.
[02:43:03.927 --> 02:43:04.648]  It's addicting.
[02:43:04.648 --> 02:43:07.070]  We're like in a super spy novel that's real.
[02:43:08.928 --> 02:43:26.154]  The evil corrupt deep state is as nasty as anyone could imagine, against God, against Christ, against Western civilization, and is literally run by a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters, and we're kicking their butt, our audience is kicking their butt, they're trying to shut us down, we're...
[02:43:26.934 --> 02:43:36.016]  We have this beachhead, but it's like watching your favorite football team at the Super Bowl in sudden death overtime, and the kicker is about to kick the field goal from 47 yards.
[02:43:36.016 --> 02:43:44.298]  You know, he only makes this 10% of the time, and it's a winless day, so he's got a shot, but it doesn't just go for 10 seconds.
[02:43:44.298 --> 02:43:49.119]  It goes on day after day, week after week of just sudden death overtime.
[02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:50.139]  They get the advantage.
[02:43:50.139 --> 02:43:51.079]  We get the advantage.
[02:43:51.079 --> 02:43:53.400]  I get chills just constantly now.
[02:43:53.860 --> 02:44:04.569]  Of how epic this is, and how they admit they're trying to isolate him in the news, and everything you've told me is just dead on in other sources.
[02:44:04.569 --> 02:44:09.754]  And to see Trump just with hyenas biting him everywhere, and it's just, it's epic!
[02:44:10.214 --> 02:44:19.779]  And then to see the cowards around him, you know, giving in to the fear and, uh, you know, or people get all hyped up for battle and go too crazy, which I understand.
[02:44:19.779 --> 02:44:21.080]  That happens to me.
[02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:25.323]  I mean, this is just such a historic time, such an amazing time.
[02:44:25.323 --> 02:44:27.624]  And the American people have to understand this is real.
[02:44:28.104 --> 02:44:31.506]  Trump isn't perfect, but he really is the real guy, what they always said.
[02:44:31.506 --> 02:44:39.192]  He's really trying to do this, and they're coming after him and don't want us to warn him that they are organizing an overthrow.
[02:44:39.192 --> 02:44:45.496]  And as you said, Mueller accelerating this grand jury right out of the swamp, right out of the loins of the DC swamp.
[02:44:45.496 --> 02:44:47.418]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[02:44:48.078 --> 02:45:02.719]  Well, and sadly, I must tell you, I am most disappointed in Steve Bannon, who I have defended on this very program, and whose worldview I probably more closely adhere to than that of the globalists.
[02:45:03.700 --> 02:45:11.643]  There have been many occasions in which Steve has not stepped up, but in this case I think he has thrown his lot in with the generals.
[02:45:11.643 --> 02:45:28.428]  He was the guy who recommended Kelly for Homeland Security, got him inside the fort, he helped undermine Trump loyalist Anthony Scaramucci, and we know that he called Drudge last week and asked him not to post the stories regarding McMaster
[02:45:29.308 --> 02:45:37.495]  Defending Susan Rice saying she had done nothing wrong when she was engaged in political, illegal, political espionage.
[02:45:37.495 --> 02:45:38.696]  Wow, that's quite a claim.
[02:45:38.696 --> 02:45:39.417]  I didn't know about that.
[02:45:39.417 --> 02:45:40.938]  I'm not saying you're making this up.
[02:45:40.938 --> 02:45:44.661]  How do you, I mean, you were told that he called drudge last week?
[02:45:44.661 --> 02:45:48.204]  Yes, I have that on very good authority.
[02:45:48.204 --> 02:45:56.491]  I also, so I think it is unfortunate because evidently Brother Bannon does not understand that the deep state will eat him last.
[02:45:57.202 --> 02:46:15.809]  Well, let's explain this, let's explain this, because the media spends it all, McMaster, between the Young Turks, CNN, the whole Soros thing, defending him like he's Jesus Christ, returned to earth in the second coming, on a silver platter, the little baby McMaster, the little golden, you know, creature, President McMaster, and then you look at it,
[02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.142]  And you pull back from it.
[02:46:19.142 --> 02:46:24.346]  It isn't just that, oh, it's normal to give a former National Security Advisor a clearance you can talk to them.
[02:46:24.346 --> 02:46:25.347]  No!
[02:46:25.347 --> 02:46:35.216]  He's defending her, saying the illegal spying, saying the unmasking, saying spying on the President, candidate, his family, all of this illegal crap is okay!
[02:46:35.216 --> 02:46:39.560]  He's there literally, publicly, massaging one of the great enemies!
[02:46:41.395 --> 02:46:57.703]  I can tell you definitively right now, Alex, the President has not been told that the UN Ambassador Samantha Powers unmasked dozens of people, according to my sources, although he may have been told that this afternoon.
[02:46:57.703 --> 02:47:02.365]  It's a perfect example of the kind of information the President needs to have, and here is why.
[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:27.820]  The finding of the FISA court at the end of Obama's term proves definitively, and without dispute, that the NSA under Barack Obama, working with the FBI, conducted unconstitutional, illegal surveillance of as many as 30,000 people for political reasons, and this information was later used in some of the unmasking that we speak of.
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:38.567]  And Sean Hannity says if it comes out he was being surveilled, they've leaked the evidence that I and Michael Savage and others were, including Trump, including his private number, uh, you know, there, uh, at his resort.
[02:47:38.567 --> 02:47:40.288]  I mean, these are real numbers, folks.
[02:47:40.288 --> 02:47:43.311]  So when he threatens the lawsuit of Obama administration, I was masked him.
[02:47:43.311 --> 02:47:43.551]  Go ahead.
[02:47:44.592 --> 02:47:52.364]  And it is absolutely true, Alex, that your phone calls with the president were monitored, or then-candidate were monitored.
[02:47:52.364 --> 02:47:54.948]  My phone calls with him were monitored.
[02:47:54.948 --> 02:47:59.135]  I've assumed that our phone calls after he became president were monitored.
[02:48:00.156 --> 02:48:02.879]  There's no probable cause here.
[02:48:02.879 --> 02:48:16.855]  I received, this week I got, I accepted service in the phony lawsuit where Obama is suing me, Obama and the Obamaites, with this fake claim yet again that I somehow colluded with the Russians.
[02:48:17.575 --> 02:48:21.160]  And it's a classic post hoc ergo proctor hoc case.
[02:48:21.160 --> 02:48:25.685]  In other words, because you knew things, that meant you made them happen or that you did them.
[02:48:25.685 --> 02:48:27.307]  It's a total fallacy.
[02:48:27.307 --> 02:48:35.517]  It's like a compendium of incorrect reports that have been reported into the fake news pasted up to look like a legal complaint.
[02:48:35.517 --> 02:48:36.137]  They have less.
[02:48:36.738 --> 02:48:37.139]  Then nothing.
[02:48:37.139 --> 02:48:38.140]  It's a vomit jerk.
[02:48:38.140 --> 02:48:41.925]  They all vomit into each other's mouth and then just, it goes in circles into perpetuity.
[02:48:41.925 --> 02:48:50.556]  Let's play that clip, because I forgot to play it, from Fox this weekend, talking about Kelly needs to isolate the president from you know who.
[02:48:50.556 --> 02:48:53.079]  The master has, I believe, three stars on his shoulder.
[02:48:53.339 --> 02:48:53.539]  Uh huh.
[02:48:53.539 --> 02:48:53.679]  Uh huh.
[02:49:16.113 --> 02:49:17.134]  Do what he says.
[02:49:17.134 --> 02:49:30.584]  But if somehow people find ways to work around even John Kelly, if the back-channeling directly to the president and sending him memos that reflect the latest Alex Jones conspiracy theory continues, then I think Kelly still has a problem on his hands.
[02:49:31.324 --> 02:49:32.625]  I love it!
[02:49:32.625 --> 02:49:35.467]  Oh, conspiracy theories like everything you're doing.
[02:49:35.467 --> 02:49:39.270]  Oh, Mr. President, here's five articles where they're saying they're going to kill you.
[02:49:39.270 --> 02:49:41.131]  Oh, yes, sir.
[02:49:41.131 --> 02:49:43.693]  Here's articles where they're going to federalize the election and steal it from you.
[02:49:43.693 --> 02:49:45.575]  Trump comes out and says, don't federalize it.
[02:49:45.575 --> 02:49:48.136]  And then Obama runs out and says, that's made up by Jones.
[02:49:48.136 --> 02:49:52.520]  Turns out he had the executive order ready and still signed it, but after.
[02:49:53.618 --> 02:49:59.888]  See, they're pissed because we're exposing them, and so the litmus test is stop Alex Jones info.
[02:49:59.888 --> 02:50:02.312]  Well, if it's just a bunch of bull, what's the problem, Roger?
[02:50:03.472 --> 02:50:04.412]  Alex, this is funny.
[02:50:04.412 --> 02:50:13.675]  I wonder who they could possibly have been speaking about when they talked about memos containing Alex Jones conspiracy theories.
[02:50:13.675 --> 02:50:23.437]  You know, look, all hell will break loose the first time Donald Trump finds out something that he should have been told and wasn't, and it has a negative ramification.
[02:50:23.437 --> 02:50:24.777]  I've known him 40 years.
[02:50:24.777 --> 02:50:26.378]  He's a midnight dialer.
[02:50:26.378 --> 02:50:28.438]  Better than Lyndon Johnson when it comes to phones.
[02:50:28.438 --> 02:50:31.459]  And let's say this, as they try to keep him from our information, what's that make him do?
[02:50:32.259 --> 02:50:34.321]  I think it'll make him seek some information.
[02:50:34.321 --> 02:50:45.829]  Don't get me wrong, in the short term, I think he's going to enjoy the additional time that he has on his hands, which is something that Reince Priebus never budgeted into the schedule.
[02:50:45.829 --> 02:50:56.436]  This story in Newsweek that he is not a hard worker, that he sits all day in a Barca lounger eating Cheetos and watching television is a lie.
[02:50:56.436 --> 02:50:58.657]  He's one of the hardest working... Wait a minute!
[02:50:58.657 --> 02:51:00.239]  Newsweek lies?
[02:51:00.239 --> 02:51:00.699]  Come on!
[02:51:01.766 --> 02:51:03.127]  I don't think they ever even told the truth.
[02:51:03.127 --> 02:51:05.128]  They are news fake, or fake week.
[02:51:05.128 --> 02:51:05.929]  Thank you, Roger.
[02:51:05.929 --> 02:51:07.229]  We got key stuff coming up, folks.

[02:53:07.989 --> 02:53:13.293]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:53:13.293 --> 02:53:14.895]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:53:14.895 --> 02:53:23.242]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:54:14.508 --> 02:54:17.250]  Coming up in the fourth hour, Owen Schroyer is going to be hosting.
[02:54:17.250 --> 02:54:18.671]  I'm going to stay a little bit into that hour.
[02:54:18.671 --> 02:54:25.316]  I'm going to play a seven days in May trailer piece that Kennedy wanted the film made from the novel.
[02:54:25.316 --> 02:54:29.380]  Of course, he never lived to see the film made about Deep State planning a coup against him.
[02:54:30.345 --> 02:54:32.906]  A lot of folks are calling this seven days in May.
[02:54:32.906 --> 02:54:37.788]  And again, a lot of people want to act like they're against Trump, because that's the trendy thing to do with some people.
[02:54:37.788 --> 02:54:39.389]  And like, they're kind of in the cool club.
[02:54:39.389 --> 02:54:47.652]  You're in the biggest ding-dong, schmuck, useful idiot, moron, sucker club in the galaxy.
[02:54:47.652 --> 02:54:50.433]  There's no hedging your bets with political cancer.
[02:54:50.433 --> 02:54:53.974]  And that's what orthodox, radical globalism is. 110%.
[02:54:57.523 --> 02:55:08.826]  And again, I don't want to sit here and bash the Muslims all day, but they've been chosen as the big demographic group, as the group that won't comply with liberalism, and so the globalists are going to use it as the tool to smash everything.
[02:55:08.826 --> 02:55:12.166]  And they're doing it, and they mean business.
[02:55:12.166 --> 02:55:17.807]  Please don't forget we're extending the sales on the amazing in-home or in-office air filtration system.
[02:55:17.807 --> 02:55:19.368]  Each unit does a large room.
[02:55:20.598 --> 02:55:23.179]  I've got these all over my house.
[02:55:23.179 --> 02:55:24.599]  I had similar units that were almost $1,000.
[02:55:24.599 --> 02:55:32.961]  And then when these came out, I looked at the specs, similar system, you know, for 250 bucks or so, I filled up my house with them now.
[02:55:32.961 --> 02:55:35.581]  And they've got a quiet mode that you can't even really hear them on.
[02:55:35.581 --> 02:55:36.321]  It's amazing.
[02:55:36.321 --> 02:55:38.802]  So I even run some here in the studio, but I've added back.
[02:55:38.802 --> 02:55:40.242]  Somebody cleaned the studio and took them out of here.
[02:55:40.242 --> 02:55:43.183]  But the point is, I'm going to add the Alexa Pures back in the studio.
[02:55:44.023 --> 02:55:46.466]  And they're just amazing.
[02:55:46.466 --> 02:55:49.709]  Comparable units are $400 to $600 now.
[02:55:49.709 --> 02:55:51.851]  The price of this technology has gone down.
[02:55:51.851 --> 02:55:53.113]  But ours is still the best deal at $219.
[02:55:53.113 --> 02:55:53.593]  It's $149 right now.
[02:55:53.593 --> 02:55:54.514]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:55:54.514 --> 02:55:56.777]  But we're going to end that special this week.
[02:55:56.777 --> 02:55:59.059]  I'm extending it for another week.
[02:56:07.156 --> 02:56:11.018]  Brain Force Plus is 55% off our amazing Nootropic.
[02:56:11.018 --> 02:56:12.339]  That's brain pill.
[02:56:12.339 --> 02:56:15.160]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen.
[02:56:15.160 --> 02:56:18.181]  Find out why the iodine conspiracy is so important.
[02:56:18.181 --> 02:56:19.702]  Secret 12, 55% off.
[02:56:19.702 --> 02:56:21.203]  Oil of Oregano, it's $17.76 as well.
[02:56:21.203 --> 02:56:21.923]  That's only 29% off on that.
[02:56:26.065 --> 02:56:32.210]  Oil of Oregano is 40% off, 55% off on Secret 12, Survival Shield 55, Rain Force 55.
[02:56:32.210 --> 02:56:34.352]  And we have the John Oliver Challenge.
[02:56:34.352 --> 02:56:37.615]  Anybody can research the health effects and the good things about bone broth.
[02:56:37.615 --> 02:56:41.659]  This is concentrated with turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen and so much more.
[02:56:41.659 --> 02:56:42.579]  All organic.
[02:56:42.579 --> 02:56:44.141]  We now have a strawberry flavor as well.
[02:56:44.141 --> 02:56:45.302]  I think it tastes great with milk.
[02:56:46.062 --> 02:56:46.983]  Are whipped up with whey.
[02:56:46.983 --> 02:56:51.885]  We also have a great whey, a true whey from one of the top developers of organic grass-fed in the country.
[02:56:51.885 --> 02:56:53.606]  Heavily discounted, so check that out.
[02:56:53.606 --> 02:57:07.913]  When you shop with the good guys for things you and your family need, then you fund an operation that has the globalists completely freaking out, that is an emergency intelligence beacon to the president and the world about the global crime syndicates operations.
[02:57:07.913 --> 02:57:10.474]  They can't believe that we won't just join them
[02:57:12.523 --> 02:57:17.066]  They can't believe that we just don't go, oh, you're the power, let me sell out immediately.
[02:57:17.066 --> 02:57:21.909]  They came to me and offered me a million dollars almost 20 years ago and couldn't believe when I didn't take it.
[02:57:21.909 --> 02:57:30.514]  Then it was 3 million, then it was 10 million, and they said, it was like major executives, this is all off record, of course, I can't give them the names, but it was like, we'll give you 10 million.
[02:57:30.514 --> 02:57:31.995]  And they're like, we don't get paid that.
[02:57:33.203 --> 02:57:34.184]  They were getting really mad.
[02:57:34.184 --> 02:57:35.885]  I just said, not going to happen, bro.
[02:57:35.885 --> 02:57:37.947]  You're not going to control me.
[02:57:37.947 --> 02:57:39.269]  I'm going to say what I want.
[02:57:39.269 --> 02:57:43.132]  And now, look where we are thanks to you.
[02:57:43.132 --> 02:57:46.896]  And we're hiring more people and more crew and launching more shows this month.
[02:57:46.896 --> 02:57:50.439]  In just a few weeks, we launched David Knight's program, Real News with David Knight.
[02:57:50.439 --> 02:57:52.401]  By the way, I announced that weeks ago.
[02:57:52.401 --> 02:57:53.782]  Trump's new show is called Real News.
[02:57:55.616 --> 02:58:01.524]  And, because that's just what it is, I mean, it's not that we're plagiarizing each other, it's just we're synced up.
[02:58:01.524 --> 02:58:04.307]  Vulcan mind meld.
[02:58:04.307 --> 02:58:05.929]  Live long and prosper.
[02:58:05.929 --> 02:58:07.771]  Defeat the pedophile networks.
[02:58:07.771 --> 02:58:09.193]  Crush the globalists.
[02:58:09.193 --> 02:58:11.716]  Return the Republic.
[02:58:11.716 --> 02:58:13.138]  Return the Republic.
[02:58:13.138 --> 02:58:15.040]  Return what you have stolen.
[02:58:16.544 --> 02:58:16.864]  We're in now.
[02:58:16.864 --> 02:58:17.645]  We're going through.
[02:58:17.645 --> 02:58:19.127]  And we're going beyond.
[02:58:19.127 --> 02:58:24.273]  Whether we escape on the other side or whether we're smashed into stardust.
[02:58:35.959 --> 02:58:38.861]  And through the fulcrum, we're going beyond.
[02:58:38.861 --> 02:58:41.422]  Fourth hour, key information straight ahead.
[02:58:41.422 --> 02:58:42.643]  Have you spread the link today?
[02:58:42.643 --> 02:58:45.304]  InfoWars.com, a lot of big breaking news.
[02:58:45.304 --> 02:58:49.167]  I haven't even gotten to yet on InfoWars.com.
[02:58:49.167 --> 02:58:50.968]  This is the InfoWars.
[02:58:57.879 --> 02:58:59.480]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:58:59.480 --> 02:59:02.061]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your canister.

[02:59:28.034 --> 02:59:38.237]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[02:59:38.237 --> 02:59:40.278]  And this part is most important.
[02:59:40.278 --> 02:59:46.680]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[02:59:47.100 --> 02:59:48.522]  That means it's clean.
[02:59:48.522 --> 02:59:49.664]  That means it's pure.
[02:59:49.664 --> 02:59:52.568]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[02:59:52.568 --> 02:59:55.352]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:59:55.352 --> 02:59:59.638]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:59:59.638 --> 03:00:02.241]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:18.268 --> 03:00:20.169]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:20.169 --> 03:00:27.892]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:27.892 --> 03:00:29.333]  Smoking gun, A.G.
[03:00:29.333 --> 03:00:31.354]  Lynch caught lying to the Clintons.
[03:00:31.354 --> 03:00:34.035]  Caught lying about not talking to the Clintons.
[03:00:34.035 --> 03:00:35.335]  DOJ releases 400 pages of...
[03:00:36.736 --> 03:00:41.018]  Lynch Clinton emails after Comey's FBI said they didn't exist.
[03:00:41.018 --> 03:00:42.879]  No communications.
[03:00:42.879 --> 03:00:45.000]  Massive perjury to Congress.
[03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:46.440]  Massive fraud.
[03:00:46.440 --> 03:00:47.981]  Massive crime.
[03:00:47.981 --> 03:00:48.981]  Red flag.
[03:00:48.981 --> 03:00:50.342]  Smoking gun.
[03:00:50.342 --> 03:00:52.943]  Hand in the cookie jar.
[03:00:52.943 --> 03:00:54.404]  Beyond the tarmac meeting.
[03:00:55.424 --> 03:00:59.666]  But don't worry, Mueller's running along like a good little demon.
[03:00:59.666 --> 03:01:01.226]  Good demon.
[03:01:01.226 --> 03:01:03.007]  Good demon.
[03:01:03.007 --> 03:01:06.508]  There with his little swap thing secret grand jury.
[03:01:06.508 --> 03:01:10.990]  I mean, they had to get a grand jury out of the District of Criminals?
[03:01:10.990 --> 03:01:11.590]  Hilarious.
[03:01:12.807 --> 03:01:19.089]  But a lot of folks are drawing parallels to Seven Days in May that a film Kennedy wanted made from a novel.
[03:01:19.089 --> 03:01:20.989]  Of course, he never lived to see the film made.
[03:01:20.989 --> 03:01:23.270]  That's parallels to Trump today.
[03:01:23.270 --> 03:01:25.470]  Here is the trailer from Seven Days in May.
[03:01:25.470 --> 03:01:34.453]  You are soon... Suggesting, Mr. President, there's a military plot to take over the government.
[03:01:37.979 --> 03:01:42.083]  There are some who will say, it can never happen here.
[03:01:42.083 --> 03:01:51.212]  But this is the story of how it could happen, in seven days of intrigue, of blackmail, of terror, an eternity of suspense.
[03:01:51.212 --> 03:02:00.662]  This is the astounding story of a military plot to overthrow the government of the United States, which, if successful, would change the fate of every American.
[03:02:12.082 --> 03:02:13.443]  You're a night crawler, Colonel.
[03:02:13.443 --> 03:02:13.983]  A peddler.
[03:02:13.983 --> 03:02:16.244]  You sell information.
[03:02:16.244 --> 03:02:19.646]  Are you sufficiently up on your Bibles to know who Judas was?
[03:02:19.646 --> 03:02:22.767]  Yes, I know who Judas was.
[03:02:22.767 --> 03:02:28.430]  He was a man I worked for and admired, until he disgraced the four stars on his uniform.
[03:02:28.430 --> 03:02:35.594]  Seven days in May, the first day, when a Marine Colonel wondered who was inciting screaming mobs in Madison Square Garden.
[03:02:38.456 --> 03:02:40.678]  Time to look at this.
[03:02:40.678 --> 03:02:45.924]  The second day, that uncovered secret meetings in Washington's back alleys.
[03:02:45.924 --> 03:02:51.950]  The third day, when unknown men prepared to kidnap the president from his private vacation resort.
[03:02:51.950 --> 03:02:57.576]  The fourth day, that brought a secret presidential messenger to death in a plane crash in Spain.
[03:02:57.576 --> 03:03:00.579]  The day a senator of the United States was held against his will.
[03:03:03.593 --> 03:03:08.175]  The fifth day, when a woman found her past being used for blackmail.
[03:03:08.175 --> 03:03:10.696]  Look, Ellie, if I could tell you why- I'll tell you something!
[03:03:10.696 --> 03:03:18.300]  I was a stupid, impressionable female, who let an Air Force general use her like his personal airplane.
[03:03:18.300 --> 03:03:25.403]  The sixth day, the discovery of a desert base for an airborne task force, kept secret even from the President of the United States.
[03:03:31.448 --> 03:03:39.395]  The seventh day, when the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff dared the President of the United States to stop the conspiracy that couldn't be proved.
[03:03:39.395 --> 03:03:41.536]  You're not a weak sister, Mr. President.
[03:03:41.536 --> 03:03:43.398]  You're a criminally weak sister.
[03:03:43.398 --> 03:03:45.139]  You say I've duped the people, General.
[03:03:45.139 --> 03:03:45.760]  I've duped them.
[03:03:45.760 --> 03:03:46.500]  I've misled them.
[03:03:46.500 --> 03:03:49.163]  I've stripped them naked and made them defenseless.
[03:03:49.163 --> 03:03:51.705]  You accuse me of having lost their faith.
[03:03:51.705 --> 03:03:55.228]  Deliberately and criminally shut my ears to the national voice.
[03:03:55.228 --> 03:03:55.428]  I do.
[03:03:58.081 --> 03:04:00.762]  Well, where the hell have you heard that voice, General?
[03:04:00.762 --> 03:04:02.062]  In freight elevators?
[03:04:02.062 --> 03:04:03.263]  In dark alleys?
[03:04:03.263 --> 03:04:05.283]  In secret places in the dead of night?
[03:04:05.283 --> 03:04:08.824]  How did that voice seep into a locked room full of conspirators?
[03:04:08.824 --> 03:04:12.625]  That's not where you hear the voice of the people, General, not in this Republic.
[03:04:12.625 --> 03:04:14.666]  And I will not resign voluntarily.
[03:04:14.666 --> 03:04:16.627]  I'm going to fight you.
[03:04:16.627 --> 03:04:19.187]  And then we'll see which one of us the United States is willing to follow.
[03:04:19.187 --> 03:04:24.369]  Starring Burt Lancaster, Kurt Douglas,
[03:04:27.848 --> 03:04:34.900]  And folks, we are now in that position and the president's already delivered in six months their whole criminal power structure is being destroyed.
[03:04:34.900 --> 03:04:36.884]  Here's the good news, even if they kill Trump and kill me...
[03:04:37.921 --> 03:04:38.941]  It doesn't matter now.
[03:04:38.941 --> 03:04:40.682]  Their whole system's blown wide open.
[03:04:40.682 --> 03:04:56.564]  People know it's unelected, they know it's foreign, they know it's globus, they know it's Islamic, they know it's satanic, they know it's pedophile, and they know it's out to get everybody, and it's anti-prosperity, and so just rejoice that we're having devastating victories right now, but it's going to be a long, hard war.
[03:04:56.564 --> 03:05:00.885]  Owen Schroer, suited up, wound up, informed, and ready to go.
[03:05:00.885 --> 03:05:02.765]  Spread the word for him online.
[03:05:02.765 --> 03:05:05.226]  You are the info war, and they can't stop you!
[03:05:07.791 --> 03:05:09.193]  Why is the fungus?
[03:05:09.193 --> 03:05:10.274]  Why is the mold?
[03:05:10.274 --> 03:05:12.036]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[03:05:12.036 --> 03:05:12.998]  What is going on?
[03:05:12.998 --> 03:05:13.759]  What has changed?
[03:05:22.270 --> 03:05:29.400]  Fungus is a growing epidemic, and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[03:05:29.400 --> 03:05:31.143]  It's available at InfoWorksStore.com.
[03:05:31.143 --> 03:05:34.307]  We also have free shipping, orders for $50 or more and 10% off.

[03:05:39.453 --> 03:05:41.454]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[03:05:41.454 --> 03:05:42.915]  For me, it's been incredible.
[03:05:42.915 --> 03:05:47.438]  MycoZX, anti-fungal, anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[03:05:47.438 --> 03:05:48.259]  Get it today.
[03:05:48.259 --> 03:05:48.759]  Limited run.
[03:05:48.759 --> 03:05:50.160]  It'll be months till we get more.
[03:05:50.160 --> 03:05:54.823]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:05:54.823 --> 03:05:58.165]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[03:05:58.165 --> 03:06:00.487]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[03:06:00.487 --> 03:06:02.288]  Look at the response we're getting.
[03:06:02.288 --> 03:06:03.849]  We're changing the world together.
[03:06:03.849 --> 03:06:04.849]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:06:04.849 --> 03:06:05.610]  God bless you all.
[03:06:07.085 --> 03:06:11.748]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:06:11.748 --> 03:06:24.695]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[03:06:24.695 --> 03:06:31.279]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[03:06:31.279 --> 03:06:33.740]  And so I set out to develop caveman.
[03:06:33.800 --> 03:06:45.028]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[03:06:45.028 --> 03:06:47.390]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[03:06:47.390 --> 03:06:48.851]  We're getting results.
[03:06:48.851 --> 03:06:54.975]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[03:06:54.975 --> 03:06:57.857]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.

[03:08:14.725 --> 03:08:17.007]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[03:08:17.007 --> 03:08:22.992]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:22.992 --> 03:08:25.815]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:08:27.532 --> 03:08:29.515]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:29.515 --> 03:08:33.179]  Crazy times we're living in.
[03:08:33.179 --> 03:08:34.861]  You know, I've got this story here.
[03:08:34.861 --> 03:08:41.370]  Democrat Governor Jerry Brown says abortion shouldn't be the Democrat Party's litmus test.
[03:08:42.861 --> 03:08:53.668]  And you can just stack this story on top of the rest of the stories that is illustrating of how the Democrats are completely falling apart right now.
[03:08:53.668 --> 03:08:55.990]  You got Republican governors switching to Democrats.
[03:08:55.990 --> 03:08:58.632]  You got the Democrat Party is actually in debt right now.
[03:08:58.632 --> 03:09:00.093]  They can't fundraise.
[03:09:00.093 --> 03:09:03.935]  You got the DNC fraud lawsuit being waged against the Democrats right now.
[03:09:03.935 --> 03:09:08.418]  And then you have Governor Jerry Brown saying abortion shouldn't be the party's litmus test.
[03:09:08.418 --> 03:09:12.621]  So now they're all going to be divided on abortion, pro-life, pro-choice matters.
[03:09:13.822 --> 03:09:14.962]  So that's all fine and good.
[03:09:14.962 --> 03:09:16.523]  The Democrats are completely collapsing.
[03:09:16.523 --> 03:09:24.888]  Oh yeah, you have Loretta Lynch, who is now another known liar of the Democrats, along with Clinton and Pelosi and the rest of them.
[03:09:24.888 --> 03:09:30.912]  Now the DOJ pretty much just, well, they did a nice number two on Loretta Lynch, didn't they?
[03:09:30.912 --> 03:09:39.217]  But it's funny, I think, this is what I'm thinking, as Jerry Brown is saying, abortion shouldn't be the Democrat Party litmus test.
[03:09:41.035 --> 03:09:44.897]  Well, America is kind of undergoing its own litmus test right now.
[03:09:44.897 --> 03:09:46.698]  And that's Trump.
[03:09:46.698 --> 03:09:49.320]  Trump is the litmus test.
[03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:53.963]  And we're all sitting here scratching our heads, we're all sitting here asking ourselves,
[03:09:55.782 --> 03:09:56.963]  How is this happening?
[03:09:56.963 --> 03:10:22.140]  How is it they're investigating Trump for Russia collusion, now they're expanding it into his finances, now they're expanding it into his family, now they're expanding it into his entire campaign team, this ever-expanding probe into President Trump, looking for any one thing they can find to make him illegitimate, say that he needs to be arrested, say that he lied or did this, looking for all of this stuff, it's been ongoing for years, they can't find anything.
[03:10:23.305 --> 03:10:28.151]  They've thrown everything against the wall to try to take Trump down.
[03:10:28.151 --> 03:10:30.273]  Okay, so they continue to fail miserably on that.
[03:10:30.273 --> 03:10:32.476]  But what is the litmus test?
[03:10:32.476 --> 03:10:36.720]  The litmus test is the fact that we're all sitting here saying, hold on a second.
[03:10:37.699 --> 03:10:59.711]  How is all of this investigation, all of this probing being done into Trump, but we have nothing on the Clintons, nothing on the Clinton Foundation, nothing on Clinton and Laura Sillsby, I mean the list goes on and on, nothing on Clinton's deleted emails, nothing on Debra Washerman Schultz threatening the DC police, nothing on the Elan brothers smashing their hard drives, nothing on Washerman Schultz threatening to get those hard drives back.
[03:11:00.757 --> 03:11:02.537]  Nothing on the Clinton-Uranium deal.
[03:11:02.537 --> 03:11:03.118]  Nothing!
[03:11:03.118 --> 03:11:05.118]  Nothing on Podesta's stock deals.
[03:11:05.118 --> 03:11:05.758]  Just nothing!
[03:11:05.758 --> 03:11:09.239]  Just completely nothing where we have all the evidence.
[03:11:09.239 --> 03:11:09.959]  It's all there.
[03:11:09.959 --> 03:11:10.760]  We've already seen it.
[03:11:10.760 --> 03:11:11.460]  We already know it.
[03:11:11.460 --> 03:11:13.340]  It's all on paper.
[03:11:13.340 --> 03:11:14.661]  So all of this is going on.
[03:11:14.661 --> 03:11:23.023]  Oh yeah, then you got Loretta Lynch meeting with the Clintons on Tarmac, saying they talked about grandkids for 45 minutes, and then saying that she had no communications.
[03:11:23.023 --> 03:11:24.483]  DOJ releases the emails.
[03:11:24.483 --> 03:11:25.143]  Yeah, you did.
[03:11:25.143 --> 03:11:27.464]  You're a lying sack of crap, Loretta Lynch.
[03:11:28.717 --> 03:11:33.001]  Barack Obama's team unmasking all of these people in the Trump campaign.
[03:11:33.001 --> 03:11:38.306]  Literally, guilt is written on the forehead of all of these Democrats.
[03:11:38.306 --> 03:11:40.628]  100% guilty, right across their forehead.
[03:11:40.628 --> 03:11:43.811]  But meanwhile, there's this probe into Trump.
[03:11:43.811 --> 03:11:47.535]  Okay, so what are we facing here?
[03:11:47.535 --> 03:11:49.557]  Here's the litmus test for America.
[03:11:50.757 --> 03:12:02.344]  If they can actually succeed in taking Trump out, if they actually are successful in this coup to remove Trump from office, the litmus test for America is now on the table.
[03:12:02.344 --> 03:12:18.655]  If we allow that to happen, if we just lay down, lay down our arms, lay down our Constitution, lay down our rights, lay down our common sense, lay down our logic, lay down our sovereignty, lay down our vote, lay it all down,
[03:12:20.185 --> 03:12:24.646]  Then that's the litmus test, America's dead.
[03:12:24.646 --> 03:12:31.828]  You can go ahead and bury the country, and we might still have flags, and we might still have ceremonies, and we can still light fireworks on the 4th of July.
[03:12:31.828 --> 03:12:45.251]  But, if we allow President Trump to be removed from office because of a deep state coup, the litmus test for America is there, and America is dead.
[03:12:45.251 --> 03:12:47.492]  Now I don't think that's how it's going to go.
[03:12:48.982 --> 03:12:53.105]  I feel that the litmus test is going to say, you know what?
[03:12:53.105 --> 03:12:55.327]  You are trying to take down our country.
[03:12:55.327 --> 03:13:04.135]  You are unelected, an unelected shadow government that has been operating behind closed doors, stealing the future from this country for years.
[03:13:04.135 --> 03:13:04.995]  We're done with you now.
[03:13:04.995 --> 03:13:06.196]  We elected a president.
[03:13:06.196 --> 03:13:07.858]  We wanted to do this peacefully.
[03:13:07.858 --> 03:13:09.159]  We tried to do this politically.
[03:13:09.159 --> 03:13:15.824]  The scum that has stolen this country is not going to let that happen.
[03:13:15.824 --> 03:13:17.906]  So that's the real litmus test for America.
[03:13:18.976 --> 03:13:23.198]  Will America let the deep state coup of Donald Trump happen?
[03:13:23.198 --> 03:13:41.629]  Will America sit idly by while this just metastasizing government is just sitting on top of us, selling us to all other buyers, selling us to all large corporations, selling us all over the world, wherever they can find it?
[03:13:41.629 --> 03:13:43.190]  But I don't think that's what's going to happen.
[03:13:44.634 --> 03:13:52.258]  No, I think if they try to remove Trump like they want to, I think that there's going to be a major backlash.
[03:13:52.258 --> 03:13:56.921]  And I actually think that the litmus test is going to say America's not dead.
[03:13:56.921 --> 03:13:59.502]  America's been very tolerant.
[03:13:59.502 --> 03:14:03.084]  America has been very patient.
[03:14:03.084 --> 03:14:04.385]  They've put up with a lot of crap.
[03:14:04.385 --> 03:14:08.267]  They've taken a lot of bruises, a lot of knees, a lot of elbows, a lot of spit in their eye.
[03:14:11.380 --> 03:14:18.706]  But they've had about enough, and I think that if they try to remove Trump from office, that will be the line in the sand.
[03:14:18.706 --> 03:14:22.148]  And the litmus test for America will say that America is not dead.
[03:14:22.148 --> 03:14:25.231]  Now, I hope that we don't find that out.
[03:14:25.231 --> 03:14:28.073]  I hope that the Democrats back off.
[03:14:28.073 --> 03:14:37.080]  I hope that the deep state backs off and lets America live, lets America thrive, at least while we have our president, and then see where it goes from there.
[03:14:37.080 --> 03:14:40.323]  But they can't do that.
[03:14:41.308 --> 03:14:46.490]  You see, the deep state and the globalists cannot let Trump be president.
[03:14:46.490 --> 03:14:49.590]  They cannot let the American people determine their own future.
[03:14:49.590 --> 03:14:51.551]  Because look what's happening, folks.
[03:14:51.551 --> 03:14:53.312]  Millions of jobs are being created.
[03:14:53.312 --> 03:14:55.352]  People are investing in America again.
[03:14:55.352 --> 03:15:00.974]  America is going to be the world power again and kick everyone's ass like they have always done.
[03:15:01.886 --> 03:15:04.968]  But the globalists cannot stand that.
[03:15:04.968 --> 03:15:22.338]  They want centralized power, not in the hands of the Republic, not in your hands, in the hands of a centralized government that will determine who gets to grow, whose growth gets stagnated, whose growth gets booms, where the population movements happen.
[03:15:22.338 --> 03:15:23.979]  They're in charge of all that.
[03:15:23.979 --> 03:15:29.363]  And if there's an America, a free and booming America, then that's not going to work.
[03:15:30.143 --> 03:15:32.464]  Because America's going to dominate the culture.
[03:15:32.464 --> 03:15:35.085]  America's going to dominate the trade market.
[03:15:35.085 --> 03:15:38.487]  America's going to show the world what a free market system does.
[03:15:38.487 --> 03:15:48.871]  And it's going to create the greatest standard of living in the history of the world.
[03:15:48.871 --> 03:15:54.393]  More so than the standard that this country has already shown.
[03:15:54.393 --> 03:15:55.934]  So that's the litmus test for America.
[03:15:57.273 --> 03:16:04.603]  Will America fight back against the globalist deep state that is trying to take down our elected president?
[03:16:05.874 --> 03:16:07.015]  I say yes.
[03:16:07.015 --> 03:16:08.616]  This is what Savage is talking about.
[03:16:08.616 --> 03:16:10.057]  This is what Alex Jones has talked about.
[03:16:10.057 --> 03:16:16.181]  That's why he went on Piers Morgan's show and said, you try to take our firearms, we will rise up.
[03:16:16.181 --> 03:16:21.084]  You try to take our elected president, you try to take our right to vote, we will rise up.
[03:16:21.084 --> 03:16:22.685]  It's the same thing.
[03:16:22.685 --> 03:16:24.886]  That's the first amendment they're trying to take away.
[03:16:24.886 --> 03:16:26.727]  Your right to vote.
[03:16:26.727 --> 03:16:27.748]  And see, but that's what I'm saying.
[03:16:27.748 --> 03:16:29.329]  They already do all this.
[03:16:29.329 --> 03:16:31.850]  They already do all this with the rigged polls.
[03:16:31.850 --> 03:16:33.772]  They already do all this with the illegal votes.
[03:16:34.875 --> 03:16:37.416]  They already do this by rigging the voting machines, folks.
[03:16:37.416 --> 03:16:40.857]  Who knows if we even ever have a fair election with these electronic voting machines?
[03:16:40.857 --> 03:16:44.578]  They break the law in Texas.
[03:16:44.578 --> 03:16:49.440]  They break the law so that you cannot have a paper ballot.
[03:16:49.440 --> 03:16:51.501]  Do you understand this?
[03:16:51.501 --> 03:16:52.301]  So, but America said...
[03:16:53.237 --> 03:16:54.537]  Fine.
[03:16:54.537 --> 03:16:56.258]  Rape my privacy.
[03:16:56.258 --> 03:16:57.698]  Rape my family.
[03:16:57.698 --> 03:16:58.859]  Rape my income.
[03:16:58.859 --> 03:17:00.139]  Just rape it all!
[03:17:00.139 --> 03:17:02.039]  Just leave me alone!
[03:17:02.039 --> 03:17:05.020]  If you just leave me alone, I'll leave you alone.
[03:17:05.020 --> 03:17:06.361]  But they're not leaving us alone.
[03:17:06.361 --> 03:17:07.901]  They're coming for our guns.
[03:17:07.901 --> 03:17:09.241]  They're coming for our president.
[03:17:09.241 --> 03:17:12.642]  They want to vaccinate our kids to death so we've had enough.
[03:17:12.642 --> 03:17:20.504]  So you take our president out, you try a deep state coup against President Trump, you're going to see what America really is.
[03:17:20.504 --> 03:17:22.165]  And it's so funny to me
[03:17:23.906 --> 03:17:31.450]  I see these polls that say President Trump, 38% approval rating, 52% say they disapprove of Donald Trump.
[03:17:31.450 --> 03:17:35.832]  You know, that's probably most Hollywood, New York, California, these people.
[03:17:35.832 --> 03:17:37.713]  Okay.
[03:17:37.713 --> 03:17:41.815]  So they're thinking in their minds, we've really got the numbers.
[03:17:41.815 --> 03:17:43.576]  We've really got the hearts and minds of America.
[03:17:43.576 --> 03:17:45.237]  Look at Trump's low approval rating.
[03:17:45.237 --> 03:17:46.998]  Look at how many people don't like Trump.
[03:17:48.464 --> 03:17:50.125]  I got news for you.
[03:17:50.125 --> 03:18:04.629]  When the rubber meets the road, those 52% of people that say they don't approve of Trump are going to be hiding in their mom's basement, cowering under a table if this country actually decides to fight for its sovereignty again, fight for its future again.
[03:18:05.089 --> 03:18:10.053]  So I don't care if you have 70% of people that say they disapprove of Trump.
[03:18:10.053 --> 03:18:21.222]  If you try to remove Trump from office, 70% of people that disapprove of Trump are going to be nowhere to be found, and the 30% of people that approve of Trump are going to be in the streets!
[03:18:21.222 --> 03:18:27.447]  That's why Julian Assange tweeted out that picture of Venezuela, where you have millions of people in Venezuela.
[03:18:27.447 --> 03:18:29.628]  Literally, the streets are flooded with people.
[03:18:29.628 --> 03:18:31.170]  It's a river of people in the streets.
[03:18:32.435 --> 03:18:44.095]  Trying to remove the communist dictator from power, and Julian Assange tweets this video out and says, this is what's going to happen to America if you remove President Trump from office.
[03:18:44.095 --> 03:18:44.697]  Exactly.
[03:18:46.169 --> 03:18:47.250]  Exactly.
[03:18:47.250 --> 03:18:48.712]  It could be 10%.
[03:18:48.712 --> 03:18:58.123]  If 10% approved of Trump, you would still see those 10% fighting for this country, and the 90% being jacklegs doing nothing.
[03:18:58.123 --> 03:18:59.785]  Because that's what the 90% are.
[03:18:59.785 --> 03:19:04.109]  We've exposed these people in the streets, they're nothings, they have no intellect, no knowledge.
[03:19:05.305 --> 03:19:07.366]  Just, they're literal nothings.
[03:19:07.366 --> 03:19:08.167]  So here's the deal.
[03:19:08.167 --> 03:19:09.787]  There's the video of Venezuela, folks.
[03:19:09.787 --> 03:19:11.268]  Truly powerful footage.
[03:19:11.268 --> 03:19:14.490]  Imagine that in America if they tried to remove President Trump.
[03:19:14.490 --> 03:19:15.490]  And that's what it would be.
[03:19:15.490 --> 03:19:17.552]  So I want to hear your thoughts on this.
[03:19:17.552 --> 03:19:19.232]  Let's take your calls on the other side.
[03:19:21.066 --> 03:19:23.066]  1-877... What's the number?
[03:19:23.066 --> 03:19:24.927]  Can you put the number up on the screen for me guys here?
[03:19:24.927 --> 03:19:26.447]  We don't have a number in here.
[03:19:26.447 --> 03:19:27.467]  So we'll open up the phone lines.
[03:19:27.467 --> 03:19:27.947]  I want to hear.
[03:19:27.947 --> 03:19:33.508]  What do you think will happen if they really try to take Trump from office?
[03:19:33.508 --> 03:19:35.829]  They're trying to isolate him from news.
[03:19:35.829 --> 03:19:37.849]  They're trying to isolate him from his constituents.
[03:19:37.849 --> 03:19:38.249]  1-800-259-09231.
[03:19:38.249 --> 03:19:38.669]  1-800-259-21... We'll get that.
[03:19:38.669 --> 03:19:40.149]  They already know the number anyway.
[03:19:40.149 --> 03:19:42.670]  We're going to take your calls on the other side, folks.
[03:19:50.643 --> 03:19:54.145]  What do you think will happen if they try to remove Trump from office?
[03:19:54.145 --> 03:19:58.346]  What do you see happening if they actually try to remove Trump from office?
[03:19:58.346 --> 03:20:00.767]  We need to get out ahead of this so they don't do it.
[03:20:00.767 --> 03:20:02.568]  Trump is the president, man!
[03:20:02.568 --> 03:20:03.789]  Let him keep kicking ass!
[03:20:06.866 --> 03:20:11.330]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[03:20:11.330 --> 03:20:12.912]  Those times may be near.
[03:20:12.912 --> 03:20:13.833]  Think about it.
[03:20:13.833 --> 03:20:18.437]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[03:20:18.437 --> 03:20:23.082]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[03:20:23.422 --> 03:20:29.227]  And a crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[03:20:29.227 --> 03:20:35.932]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[03:20:35.932 --> 03:20:38.494]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[03:20:38.934 --> 03:20:41.736]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[03:21:07.699 --> 03:21:11.484]  MycoZx is back in after five plus months sold out.
[03:21:11.484 --> 03:21:12.986]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[03:21:12.986 --> 03:21:14.688]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[03:21:14.688 --> 03:21:17.112]  Latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[03:21:17.112 --> 03:21:18.293]  It's been sold out for months.
[03:21:18.293 --> 03:21:19.194]  Big waiting list.
[03:21:19.194 --> 03:21:22.499]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it in California.
[03:21:22.639 --> 03:21:23.079]  I don't know.

[03:25:58.610 --> 03:26:01.352]  People started getting into Bone Broth and Bone Broth supplements.
[03:26:01.352 --> 03:26:05.096]  It just shows you how behind the times and out of touch with
[03:26:05.777 --> 03:26:21.171]  Reality these people are so take advantage of the John Oliver special We're really proud to bring you the John Oliver special and we'd like to thank John Oliver for plugging our products on his show That was a free plug the John Oliver special folks chocolate or strawberry caveman.

[03:27:18.512 --> 03:27:19.693]  Okay, so the question is...
[03:27:20.726 --> 03:27:23.367]  What will happen if they remove Trump from office?
[03:27:23.367 --> 03:27:38.854]  If they actually remove Donald Trump from office, whether it be politically, with the grand jury, or the grand jury can't do it, but whether they impeach him, whatever, or kill him, whatever it is, whichever way, however they can, whatever they choose, if they remove Trump from office, what do you think would happen?
[03:27:38.854 --> 03:27:43.076]  Let's start with, let's go to Steven in Florida.
[03:27:43.076 --> 03:27:45.917]  Steven, what do you think would happen if they remove Trump from office?
[03:27:47.369 --> 03:27:58.099]  Yeah, hey Owen, well first of all I want to say this, and I hope you'll get this information Alex, I tweeted this to him, and this ties in with what you're asking about Trump.
[03:27:58.099 --> 03:28:04.365]  You guys need to look into the background of Rodney Howard Brown, the so-called pastor from South Africa.
[03:28:05.103 --> 03:28:07.123]  That guy is as phony as a $3 bill.
[03:28:07.123 --> 03:28:09.964]  Alright, well that's a separate issue right now.
[03:28:09.964 --> 03:28:11.104]  I don't know anything about that.
[03:28:11.104 --> 03:28:12.685]  I'm not talking about the pastor.
[03:28:12.685 --> 03:28:15.785]  I want to ask you what happens if Trump removes from office.
[03:28:15.785 --> 03:28:17.606]  So if you want to answer that question, please do.
[03:28:17.606 --> 03:28:20.126]  If not, we're going to move on.
[03:28:20.126 --> 03:28:21.486]  Well, here's what I say.
[03:28:21.486 --> 03:28:32.269]  I've been trying to get tweets through to all the people, you know, out there on Twitter and posts on Facebook, warning people about what McMaster and Mueller and these guys are doing.
[03:28:32.269 --> 03:28:33.569]  I take this very seriously.
[03:28:34.558 --> 03:28:40.427]  I really think they're going to try and kill him and his family just like the Bolsheviks did with the Tsars.
[03:28:40.427 --> 03:28:43.772]  And so the thing is, is that here's what I believe.
[03:28:43.772 --> 03:28:44.393]  Number one,
[03:28:45.089 --> 03:28:49.712]  Trump's got so much of a base, and it's more than 50%.
[03:28:49.712 --> 03:28:52.314]  I don't care what the media says, they're lying.
[03:28:52.314 --> 03:28:54.876]  Yeah, who's taking these polls anyway?
[03:28:54.876 --> 03:28:57.999]  It's the same thing like Mark Zuckerberg thinks he has a chance to be president.
[03:28:57.999 --> 03:29:02.442]  He doesn't realize, hey bro, people that vote aren't all on Facebook.
[03:29:02.442 --> 03:29:07.305]  There's a whole class of millions of people that aren't on your stupid Facebook, bro.
[03:29:07.305 --> 03:29:07.786]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:29:08.595 --> 03:29:10.357]  No, something's going to break here.
[03:29:10.357 --> 03:29:13.842]  The dam's going to break and it's going to overflow them.
[03:29:13.842 --> 03:29:15.925]  And here's the main thing I want to say.
[03:29:15.925 --> 03:29:21.292]  The Bible says that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomsoever He will.
[03:29:21.292 --> 03:29:21.793]  God put
[03:29:23.021 --> 03:29:24.742]  Donald Trump in the White House.
[03:29:24.742 --> 03:29:28.784]  So they're going to get more than backlash from the American people.
[03:29:28.784 --> 03:29:29.984]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[03:29:29.984 --> 03:29:30.845]  And here's the other thing, too.
[03:29:30.845 --> 03:29:35.027]  Because Trump has a big family and such a big base, they're not going to be able to get away with this.
[03:29:35.027 --> 03:29:35.607]  And here's the thing.
[03:29:35.607 --> 03:29:41.370]  Regardless, the whole thing, whatever you think about Pastor Brown, the point is, they're saying this.
[03:29:41.370 --> 03:29:43.211]  I mean, they're all saying it.
[03:29:43.211 --> 03:29:45.172]  Brennan, Clapper, Gore.
[03:29:45.512 --> 03:29:47.453]  They're all saying remove Trump from office!
[03:29:47.453 --> 03:29:48.774]  They're saying it all over the news!
[03:29:48.774 --> 03:29:52.235]  CNN has Kathy Griffin with a beheaded ISIS head!
[03:29:52.235 --> 03:29:53.476]  So, of course they're saying it!
[03:29:53.476 --> 03:29:56.017]  We'll be right back with more Your Calls.
[03:29:56.017 --> 03:29:57.418]  We're on the march.
[03:29:57.418 --> 03:29:59.959]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:59.959 --> 03:30:02.641]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:07.899 --> 03:30:09.280]  Why is the fungus?
[03:30:09.280 --> 03:30:10.401]  Why is the mold?
[03:30:10.401 --> 03:30:12.142]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[03:30:12.142 --> 03:30:13.103]  What is going on?
[03:30:13.103 --> 03:30:13.863]  What has changed?
[03:30:38.159 --> 03:30:39.580]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[03:30:39.580 --> 03:30:40.620]  I want to get your reviews.
[03:30:40.620 --> 03:30:41.581]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[03:30:41.581 --> 03:30:43.041]  For me, it's been incredible.
[03:30:43.041 --> 03:30:47.544]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[03:30:47.544 --> 03:30:48.364]  Get it today.

[03:30:54.927 --> 03:30:58.268]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[03:30:58.268 --> 03:31:00.610]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[03:31:00.610 --> 03:31:02.010]  Look at the response we're getting.
[03:31:02.010 --> 03:31:03.951]  We're changing the world together.
[03:31:03.951 --> 03:31:04.972]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:31:04.972 --> 03:31:05.712]  God bless you all.
[03:31:07.156 --> 03:31:15.899]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[03:31:15.899 --> 03:31:16.440]  That's right.

[03:31:35.967 --> 03:31:36.207]  Woo!

[03:31:37.247 --> 03:31:45.970]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[03:31:45.970 --> 03:31:55.573]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[03:31:55.573 --> 03:31:59.014]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.

[03:32:15.364 --> 03:32:17.345]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.

[03:32:30.856 --> 03:32:37.742]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:32:37.742 --> 03:32:40.724]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.

[03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:33.873]  Is there any doubt McMaster's is working against the American people?
[03:33:33.873 --> 03:33:35.194]  Here's a story from Breitbart.
[03:33:35.194 --> 03:33:36.894]  This was published yesterday.
[03:33:36.894 --> 03:33:42.377]  McMaster worked at Think Tank, backed by Soros-funded group that helped Obama sell Iran deal.
[03:33:43.863 --> 03:33:44.984]  Shocker.
[03:33:44.984 --> 03:33:46.845]  White House National Security Advisor H.R.
[03:33:46.845 --> 03:34:00.995]  McMaster served at a UK-based think tank financed by a controversial George Soros-funded group, identified by the Obama White House as central in helping to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the public and news media.
[03:34:00.995 --> 03:34:02.757]  Isn't that just a sweet little juicy?
[03:34:04.141 --> 03:34:15.606]  From September 2006 to February 2017, McMaster is listed as a member of International Institute for Strategic Studies, where he served as a Consulting Senior Fellow.
[03:34:15.606 --> 03:34:22.949]  The IISS describes itself as a world-leading authority on global security, political risk, and military conflict.
[03:34:23.729 --> 03:34:45.240]  So of course that has George Soros' fingerprints all over it and then you have the ties into the Obama-Iran nuclear deal and there's McMaster sitting right on top of there as a senior fellow, the bald-headed chrome dome swamp creature.
[03:34:45.240 --> 03:34:46.461]  It is amazing how you can just
[03:34:48.851 --> 03:34:52.752]  I mean, you can just look at these people and see who they are.
[03:34:52.752 --> 03:35:00.733]  I mean, George Soros, McMaster, Debbie Washerman Schultz, Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[03:35:00.733 --> 03:35:08.574]  Folks, God is trying to tell you these people are wicked, evil creatures!
[03:35:08.574 --> 03:35:17.136]  I mean, point to me all the liberals out there that actually look like they're full of life, just blossoming with passion and love for humanity.
[03:35:18.174 --> 03:35:21.376]  Show me the liberals!
[03:35:21.376 --> 03:35:25.139]  They aren't out there.
[03:35:25.139 --> 03:35:36.427]  I thank God for exposing these people, physically manifesting these demonic creatures into the human form that they've taken.
[03:35:36.427 --> 03:35:37.448]  Let's go back to your calls.
[03:35:37.448 --> 03:35:38.189]  The question is,
[03:35:39.352 --> 03:35:43.654]  What do you think will happen if President Trump is removed from office?
[03:35:43.654 --> 03:35:45.075]  I know we have a caller in Canada.
[03:35:45.075 --> 03:35:48.416]  I just want to take these American callers first, but I'll get to you.
[03:35:48.416 --> 03:35:52.158]  Let's go to Margaret in Oklahoma.
[03:35:52.158 --> 03:35:56.640]  What do you think is going to happen if the deep state removes Trump from office?
[03:35:56.640 --> 03:36:02.002]  Well, I think that since we are so disorganized that they will just roll over us.
[03:36:02.697 --> 03:36:12.279]  Because what we needed already was to have people on the local level talking to each other about the situation and what they're going to do.
[03:36:12.279 --> 03:36:27.103]  There was a young man who put up, it's kind of like a continuity of government on the citizen level, but he said that the government is so corrupt that it's going to fall from its own weight and we just have to get ready and be ready when it happens.
[03:36:27.103 --> 03:36:27.963]  But the thing was,
[03:36:29.923 --> 03:36:37.607]  He came up with something that he wanted people to be able to organize and do things that the government didn't have to give permission for.
[03:36:37.607 --> 03:36:41.269]  And he had something called the Solution to Reclaiming Liberty.
[03:36:41.269 --> 03:36:42.710]  It was in four parts.
[03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:44.511]  The first part was a declaration.
[03:36:44.511 --> 03:36:47.573]  People declared that they liked their liberty and they didn't want to give it up.
[03:36:48.365 --> 03:36:56.529]  The second part was called the Liberty Bell, that anyone would call this number if the police were harassing them and people would show up with cell phones to help them.
[03:36:56.529 --> 03:37:02.592]  The third part was the Common Law Court, that they were actually doing this in Alaska.
[03:37:02.592 --> 03:37:10.375]  Here's the problem, because I hear what you're saying and I think that the premise is a good idea, it's just that it's getting a little too complicated for most people, just to be honest with you.
[03:37:10.375 --> 03:37:13.397]  Most people, once you get to step three, you're just going to lose them.
[03:37:13.817 --> 03:37:36.866]  I had a similar idea that was you just find like-minded people locally, maybe that means going door-to-door, passing out a flyer, maybe putting a Trump flag up in your yard, just some little tactic you can do to find like-minded people, and then you take it one step further, and once you have the like-minded people that want to work to save this country, you say, okay, here's what we're going to do.
[03:37:36.866 --> 03:37:38.906]  I was going to do this in St.
[03:37:38.906 --> 03:37:40.267]  Louis, actually, before I moved here.
[03:37:41.067 --> 03:37:45.131]  You find the like-minded people and you basically prepare yourself for the worst.
[03:37:45.131 --> 03:37:59.626]  And you say, okay, if the worst happens, which would be they remove Trump from power, or the power grid goes down, a big terror attack, whatever it could be, some sort of blast that takes out the entire electric grid.
[03:38:01.192 --> 03:38:15.060]  So then you say, okay, you've got all these people together, you're responsible for ammo, you're responsible for firearms, you're responsible for food, you're responsible for water, you're responsible for mapping out where we need to go, you're responsible for shelter, you're responsible for this, you're responsible for seats.
[03:38:15.060 --> 03:38:17.482]  So then you kind of create your little emergency community.
[03:38:17.482 --> 03:38:24.526]  I don't know if that's exactly what you were talking about, but that's kind of, I feel like, what you were talking about.
[03:38:24.526 --> 03:38:28.849]  And the point you're making is that Americans are, for the most part, individualists.
[03:38:29.289 --> 03:38:35.752]  We take care of ourselves, we take care of our families, we take care of our own property, and we don't really bother you.
[03:38:35.752 --> 03:38:37.553]  We don't really get involved with your business.
[03:38:37.553 --> 03:38:38.953]  We don't really want to bother you.
[03:38:38.953 --> 03:38:40.774]  We don't want to get involved with your business.
[03:38:40.774 --> 03:38:43.095]  You live your life how you want to live your life.
[03:38:43.095 --> 03:38:44.956]  I'll live my life how I want to live my life.
[03:38:44.956 --> 03:38:46.877]  True Americana liberalism.
[03:38:46.877 --> 03:38:53.640]  But because of that, as you said, perhaps we're not the most prepared for a disaster because we're always living our own lives.
[03:38:53.640 --> 03:38:57.342]  So I'm not sure if that's a proper response, but what are your thoughts on that before we take another call?
[03:38:58.281 --> 03:39:01.643]  I think the thing is that we don't stand up for our people.
[03:39:01.643 --> 03:39:04.084]  We aren't helping the people we need to be helping now.
[03:39:04.084 --> 03:39:05.705]  Like the Bundys, for instance.
[03:39:05.705 --> 03:39:12.668]  And Schaefer Cox, who's the one that came up with that solution to reclaiming liberty.
[03:39:12.668 --> 03:39:17.151]  They made up a story against him and railroaded it to the jury and gave him 26 years.
[03:39:17.151 --> 03:39:20.332]  Otherwise, he's sitting in a SCMU prison now.
[03:39:20.332 --> 03:39:23.554]  And he has an appeal date on August the 16th and we hope they'll let him go.
[03:39:24.392 --> 03:39:34.284]  We need to stand up for the Bundys, we need to stand up for people, and we need to get together on a local level, just like Schaefer was describing in his solution to reclaiming liberty, which is on YouTube.
[03:39:34.284 --> 03:39:40.711]  That people can talk to each other on a local level and decide how they're going to take care of each other.
[03:39:43.394 --> 03:39:46.897]  The solution to reclaiming liberty was the militia.
[03:39:46.897 --> 03:39:48.759]  That was the fourth part.
[03:39:48.759 --> 03:39:56.685]  People need to do what they can do to... Yeah, and I'm pretty sure that's eventually what landed him in jail, was the militia stuff.
[03:39:56.685 --> 03:39:59.647]  If I recall correctly, with Schaefer-Cox.
[03:39:59.647 --> 03:40:00.388]  Hello?
[03:40:00.388 --> 03:40:00.888]  Am I still on?
[03:40:00.888 --> 03:40:07.914]  Yeah, I believe it was the militia stuff and the stuff he wanted to organize with the Second Amendment that wound up Schaefer-Cox in prison.
[03:40:09.016 --> 03:40:10.680]  No, they made it all up.
[03:40:10.680 --> 03:40:13.466]  It was because of his solution to reclaiming liberty they made
[03:40:14.765 --> 03:40:16.587]  Totally illegal.
[03:40:16.587 --> 03:40:18.849]  The trial was illegal.
[03:40:18.849 --> 03:40:21.411]  Yeah, it's the same thing.
[03:40:21.411 --> 03:40:23.653]  Look, it's sad.
[03:40:23.653 --> 03:40:25.114]  I want justice for Schaefer Cox.
[03:40:25.114 --> 03:40:27.356]  I don't want the Bundys to have their land stolen.
[03:40:27.356 --> 03:40:36.203]  I don't want an Amish farmer who makes a product in his backyard to get hit with some regulation suit and then end up in jail for the rest of his life.
[03:40:36.203 --> 03:40:36.984]  A grandfather.
[03:40:36.984 --> 03:40:39.886]  This is the type of garbage that liberal judges and
[03:40:43.343 --> 03:40:44.084]  I don't know what to do.
[03:40:44.084 --> 03:40:47.626]  Again, it's like, how can I take care of everything?
[03:40:47.626 --> 03:40:51.588]  How can we be here in Austin and try to take care of every case?
[03:40:51.588 --> 03:40:54.930]  You just gotta mobilize locally, and I guess that's what Margaret is saying.
[03:40:54.930 --> 03:40:55.370]  It sucks.
[03:40:55.370 --> 03:40:56.791]  I wish I could do more for Schaefer Cox.
[03:40:56.791 --> 03:40:58.012]  I wish I could do more for the Bundys.
[03:40:59.032 --> 03:41:03.514]  Um, you know, but here we are trying to keep Trump from getting ousted from office, our elected president.
[03:41:03.514 --> 03:41:04.534]  Yeah, it's all crazy.
[03:41:04.534 --> 03:41:09.256]  This, it's literally just a cyclone of, uh, of madness here in America.
[03:41:09.256 --> 03:41:10.737]  Thank you for the call, Margaret.
[03:41:10.737 --> 03:41:12.777]  Let's go to John in Wisconsin.
[03:41:12.777 --> 03:41:15.318]  What do you think would happen if Trump is removed from office?
[03:41:15.318 --> 03:41:15.919]  Go ahead, John.
[03:41:15.919 --> 03:41:27.143]  Well, uh, first of all, I want to say about Margaret, uh, and all this stuff, there was a, um, a lawgiver that, uh, was suggesting that they put a,
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:33.584]  Well, there's one thing you've got to remember is that
[03:41:57.651 --> 03:42:01.933]  How many ex-military people you got in this country?
[03:42:01.933 --> 03:42:04.995]  It's 15 million people that are armed and know how to use weapons?
[03:42:04.995 --> 03:42:10.158]  If they're an oath keeper, they will say yes.
[03:42:10.158 --> 03:42:16.382]  So if they're called upon and things go down to where they have to act, they will act.
[03:42:16.382 --> 03:42:21.364]  And the perpetrators will be rounded up and neutralized.
[03:42:21.364 --> 03:42:24.486]  And they just don't get it.
[03:42:24.486 --> 03:42:25.727]  I think they think they're above it.
[03:42:26.792 --> 03:42:30.094]  They've been wanting this country to collapse.
[03:42:30.094 --> 03:42:40.960]  They can destroy a nation state and destroy the concept of countries being sovereign with big international conglomerates and big international companies and industries and everything.
[03:42:40.960 --> 03:42:43.321]  You know, that's an old story.
[03:42:43.321 --> 03:42:51.846]  But I think they really believe that they're either in enough control that they can be above it or they think they can maybe isolate themselves from it.
[03:42:51.846 --> 03:42:53.047]  Or they think somehow they can
[03:42:54.352 --> 03:42:58.876]  Remove Trump from power and avoid the backlash that is inevitable.
[03:42:58.876 --> 03:43:00.437]  But you're 100% right.
[03:43:00.437 --> 03:43:10.186]  This isn't going to be like Venezuela, where it's just, unfortunately for the Venezuelans, just unarmed people marching in the street that can't do anything.
[03:43:10.186 --> 03:43:13.389]  I mean, they have to throw rocks, they have to throw homemade fireworks.
[03:43:13.389 --> 03:43:14.450]  You know, they can't do anything.
[03:43:14.450 --> 03:43:16.792]  And then President Maduro of Venezuela basically
[03:43:18.117 --> 03:43:23.660]  Putting out a new threat like... I mean, they're gonna get even tougher on these protesters, so... But that's not the case!
[03:43:23.660 --> 03:43:27.022]  And here's the other thing!
[03:43:27.022 --> 03:43:30.744]  If they think for one second that police...
[03:43:32.280 --> 03:43:33.401]  Or military?
[03:43:33.401 --> 03:43:34.522]  Or the National Guard?
[03:43:34.522 --> 03:43:38.746]  Or anybody who's going to enforce martial law after you remove President Trump?
[03:43:38.746 --> 03:43:41.148]  You are out of your mind!
[03:43:41.148 --> 03:43:44.951]  You are out of your mind if you think they're going to go along with that.
[03:43:44.951 --> 03:43:45.851]  Here's what's going to happen.
[03:43:45.851 --> 03:43:50.995]  They're going to say, face those people who are protesting our removal of President Trump.
[03:43:50.995 --> 03:43:54.058]  And then the National Guard will have their weapons, and the police, and they'll be ready.
[03:43:54.058 --> 03:44:01.224]  And then they'll do an about face, and they'll look right at the people that gave them that command and said, no, I think it's time to bring you to justice.
[03:44:02.375 --> 03:44:03.996]  I don't know.
[03:44:03.996 --> 03:44:07.017]  I think that they really think they're either immune or above it.
[03:44:07.017 --> 03:44:09.458]  Let's go to Angie in Alaska.
[03:44:09.458 --> 03:44:12.940]  What do you think will happen if Trump is removed from office?
[03:44:12.940 --> 03:44:13.620]  Go ahead, Angie.
[03:44:13.620 --> 03:44:15.781]  I think it would be civil war.
[03:44:15.781 --> 03:44:19.262]  I think that it would be total chaos.
[03:44:19.262 --> 03:44:20.503]  It already is civil war.
[03:44:20.503 --> 03:44:21.223]  That's the truth.
[03:44:21.223 --> 03:44:22.444]  We're already in a civil war.
[03:44:22.444 --> 03:44:23.064]  Will it go hot?
[03:44:24.321 --> 03:44:28.262]  If they think that the people are going to just lay down and take it, they're sorely mistaken.
[03:44:28.262 --> 03:44:34.144]  And when the gentleman prior to me said, Oath Keepers, they forget we've got Oath Keepers high up.
[03:44:34.144 --> 03:44:36.945]  We have Oath Keepers in our local law enforcement.
[03:44:36.945 --> 03:44:38.325]  We have Oath Keepers with militia.
[03:44:38.325 --> 03:44:42.406]  We have Oath Keepers in our armies and all of our military.
[03:44:42.406 --> 03:44:44.387]  We have Oath Keepers with CIA and FBI.
[03:44:44.387 --> 03:44:46.767]  So I think that they're absolutely nuts.
[03:44:46.767 --> 03:44:48.788]  I think that they will find out real quick.
[03:44:49.457 --> 03:44:52.681]  Yeah, and keep in mind too, you make a good point with the Oath Keepers, but keep in mind too folks,
[03:45:05.677 --> 03:45:14.621]  Think about all the Black Ops people that are retired, all the Marine Corps people that are retired, all the military veterans that are retired.
[03:45:14.621 --> 03:45:25.145]  I meet so many of these people when I go out on the road, and some of these people, I mean, these are very able-bodied people that could probably go right into prime shape the next day if they needed to be called to action.
[03:45:25.965 --> 03:45:28.227]  They're not going to lay down their arms!
[03:45:28.227 --> 03:45:33.270]  They're not going to lay down... They literally put their life on the line for this country!
[03:45:33.270 --> 03:45:39.975]  You think they're going to let some snot-nosed Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, piece of crap take the country from them?
[03:45:39.975 --> 03:45:42.076]  You know what's funny?
[03:45:42.076 --> 03:45:49.341]  Nancy Pelosi, in that video that went viral of the guy going up and confronting her... See if you can pull up this video, guys.
[03:45:49.341 --> 03:45:53.144]  The guy goes up and confronts Nancy Pelosi, says, prison time's coming, prison time's coming.
[03:45:54.292 --> 03:46:02.899]  There is a moment after he says that, that is illustrative of everything that is the globalist establishment in America right now.
[03:46:02.899 --> 03:46:14.268]  Nancy Pelosi, immediately after confronted with the reality that she's about to face justice, her handler has to take her by the hand and escort her away, folks.
[03:46:14.268 --> 03:46:15.329]  See if you can play this video.
[03:46:16.601 --> 03:46:24.972]  Folks, John McCain, Nancy Pelosi, watch this, she's gonna be great, that's her handler, let me take you by the arm Nancy, I got you, I got you.
[03:46:24.972 --> 03:46:34.584]  Folks, these people are so mentally dilapidated, they're so mentally ill, they literally have brain cancer, they literally have mental disorders, they literally have dementia.
[03:46:34.884 --> 03:46:36.285]  This is their establishment.
[03:46:36.285 --> 03:46:39.307]  Or then you have Chuck Schumer, the dirtiest rat.
[03:46:39.307 --> 03:46:44.210]  I read some story today about how there's a new record size of the biggest rats ever in New York City.
[03:46:44.210 --> 03:46:45.671]  Well, they haven't measured Chuck Schumer!
[03:46:45.671 --> 03:46:48.233]  That's the biggest rat in the history of the whole state!
[03:46:48.233 --> 03:46:49.714]  Chuck Schumer!
[03:46:49.714 --> 03:47:04.804]  If you think for one second that pieces of crap like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are gonna have the say and are gonna force military veterans, Marine Corps veterans, Navy SEAL veterans to lay down their law and just let you take their vote away from them?
[03:47:06.165 --> 03:47:07.426]  Oh my gosh!
[03:47:07.426 --> 03:47:08.967]  It's just ridiculous!
[03:47:08.967 --> 03:47:10.848]  Thank you for the call, Angie.
[03:47:10.848 --> 03:47:13.550]  Let's go to Josh in Oregon.
[03:47:13.550 --> 03:47:16.992]  What do you think would happen if they tried to remove Trump?
[03:47:16.992 --> 03:47:18.233]  Can you hear me?
[03:47:18.233 --> 03:47:20.214]  Yep, go ahead.
[03:47:20.214 --> 03:47:21.015]  Awesome.
[03:47:21.015 --> 03:47:29.480]  So hey, before I do this, I want to say I take the X2 and the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and that stuff is a bomb.
[03:47:29.480 --> 03:47:30.881]  And I gotta say, I don't just buy it from them.
[03:47:30.881 --> 03:47:33.503]  I'm a big supporter of you guys, but I definitely don't buy it because of that.
[03:47:34.293 --> 03:47:35.634]  It's the best stuff I've found.
[03:47:35.634 --> 03:47:37.556]  I mean, it's really incredible.
[03:47:37.556 --> 03:47:38.277]  Yeah, it's good stuff.
[03:47:38.277 --> 03:47:38.837]  I use it too.
[03:47:38.837 --> 03:47:41.860]  Yeah, just wanted to give that quick testimony.
[03:47:41.860 --> 03:47:50.487]  But hey, as far as what's going to happen if President Trump is taken out of office, I mean, we're all trying to look for a rationale here.
[03:47:50.487 --> 03:47:53.049]  The thing is, these are irrational people at this point.
[03:47:53.049 --> 03:47:57.473]  They're in a corner right now, and they're criminals, and they know they're screwed.
[03:47:57.473 --> 03:47:58.534]  So this is what they have to do.
[03:47:58.991 --> 03:47:59.992]  That is so key.
[03:47:59.992 --> 03:48:00.893]  That is so key.
[03:48:00.893 --> 03:48:10.585]  You cannot, when you're talking to your friends, when you're talking about this stuff, it is so key to understand Trump is not the one that's cornered, folks.
[03:48:11.764 --> 03:48:13.045]  That's the optics they're pointing.
[03:48:13.045 --> 03:48:17.168]  They're trying to say Trump is cornered, Republicans are cornered, you're cornered, America's cornered.
[03:48:17.168 --> 03:48:17.948]  No.
[03:48:17.948 --> 03:48:19.349]  The globalists are cornered.
[03:48:19.349 --> 03:48:20.610]  The deep state is cornered.
[03:48:20.610 --> 03:48:22.111]  The establishment is cornered.
[03:48:22.111 --> 03:48:22.932]  Obama.
[03:48:22.932 --> 03:48:23.572]  Lynch.
[03:48:23.572 --> 03:48:24.392]  Powers.
[03:48:24.392 --> 03:48:26.394]  They're the ones that are cornered, folks.
[03:48:26.394 --> 03:48:28.035]  They are the cornered rats.
[03:48:28.035 --> 03:48:28.735]  CNN.
[03:48:28.735 --> 03:48:29.416]  Cornered rats.
[03:48:29.416 --> 03:48:37.041]  Like Brian Stelter pretending that McEnany, doing a report on news because she likes Trump, it's fake news.
[03:48:37.041 --> 03:48:41.664]  Brian Stelter looks like George Costanza and is about as trustworthy as George Costanza.
[03:48:42.224 --> 03:48:44.245]  These people are a failing joke.
[03:48:44.245 --> 03:48:45.305]  Thank you for the call, Josh.
[03:48:45.305 --> 03:48:46.926]  Let's go to Paul in California.
[03:48:46.926 --> 03:48:51.547]  What do you think will happen if they try to remove Trump from office?
[03:48:51.547 --> 03:48:58.149]  My question is, what's going on as far as protecting the President of the United States?
[03:48:58.149 --> 03:49:05.132]  Well, you heard Alex earlier say he's got a special military-type protection team, as well as Secret Service.
[03:49:05.132 --> 03:49:08.573]  So, I mean, anything else, you probably know as much as me.
[03:49:10.280 --> 03:49:20.829]  Okay, well, as far as kicking Trump out, I think the Secret Service needs to do their job so he's not kicked out.
[03:49:20.829 --> 03:49:30.477]  Well, the Secret Service is not a political wing, so if you're talking about if they physically try to remove him, the Secret Service stepping in, who knows?
[03:49:30.477 --> 03:49:31.918]  Who knows what they can do?
[03:49:31.918 --> 03:49:34.541]  Who knows what they think they can pull off?
[03:49:34.541 --> 03:49:35.221]  It's all insane.
[03:49:35.221 --> 03:49:38.324]  The notion that they think they can remove Trump from office just goes to show...
[03:49:42.208 --> 03:49:45.211]  How many people have been telling you your government has been taken over?
[03:49:45.211 --> 03:49:49.794]  How many years has Alex Jones been telling you the United States government has been infiltrated?
[03:49:49.794 --> 03:49:52.557]  How many times have people told you that the Republic has fallen?
[03:49:52.557 --> 03:49:56.080]  We've been telling you this for years!
[03:49:56.080 --> 03:49:57.160]  Here you are.
[03:49:57.160 --> 03:49:58.341]  Here's the evidence.
[03:49:58.341 --> 03:50:02.165]  It's all happening right now.
[03:50:02.165 --> 03:50:05.507]  Final comment, Paul.
[03:50:05.507 --> 03:50:05.968]  Nothing.
[03:50:05.968 --> 03:50:09.731]  I'm just sad that the President isn't being protected.
[03:50:10.475 --> 03:50:14.978]  Well look, they haven't removed him yet, so I mean... I mean, who knows if he's not being protected.
[03:50:14.978 --> 03:50:22.123]  I mean, you can't say Secret Service is not protecting him, so... But again, who knows what they think they can do?
[03:50:22.123 --> 03:50:22.564]  Who knows?
[03:50:22.564 --> 03:50:25.366]  Maybe they really think that they can impeach him.
[03:50:25.366 --> 03:50:28.548]  Maybe they really think that they can find something to remove him physically.
[03:50:28.548 --> 03:50:30.009]  Maybe they think they can kill him.
[03:50:30.009 --> 03:50:31.030]  I don't know what they think.
[03:50:31.795 --> 03:50:33.156]  But we know what they want to do!
[03:50:33.156 --> 03:50:35.878]  They've made that obvious since day one!
[03:50:35.878 --> 03:50:36.658]  All of them!
[03:50:36.658 --> 03:50:37.599]  In the media!
[03:50:37.599 --> 03:50:38.880]  Pretending to shoot him!
[03:50:38.880 --> 03:50:41.522]  Pretending to have him stabbed at a play in New York!
[03:50:41.522 --> 03:50:44.383]  Pretending to behead him!
[03:50:44.383 --> 03:50:47.285]  Foisting this Russian probe on us for the last year!
[03:50:47.285 --> 03:50:48.967]  A total canard!
[03:50:49.767 --> 03:50:56.136]  If you want to talk about treason, anybody who's been forcing this Russia thing down our throats ought to be tried for treason.
[03:50:56.136 --> 03:50:57.017]  I'm just done with it.
[03:50:57.017 --> 03:51:00.902]  President Trump, just start arresting people.
[03:51:00.902 --> 03:51:02.244]  Who cares what they say about you?
[03:51:02.244 --> 03:51:03.706]  They fake beheaded you, Trump!
[03:51:03.706 --> 03:51:04.567]  Just arrest them all!

[03:52:06.164 --> 03:52:10.827]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:52:10.827 --> 03:52:22.193]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition.
[03:52:22.193 --> 03:52:23.074]  We're good to go.

[03:54:14.253 --> 03:54:24.761]  You know, if Trump had one-tenth, one-tenth, in fact, if Trump had one-one-hundredth of the controversial track record of a Loretta Lynch, a James Comey, an H.R.
[03:54:24.761 --> 03:54:32.768]  McMaster, a Hillary Clinton, a John Podesta, a John McCain, they would have not even let him run for president.
[03:54:32.768 --> 03:54:33.889]  They might have done a public lynching.
[03:54:34.997 --> 03:54:40.359]  But no, the Democrats are allowed to have all the collusion, collude with whoever they want, sell security secrets to anybody.
[03:54:40.359 --> 03:54:44.740]  The Clintons can sell secrets to the Chinese, who sell them to North Korea, who now may nuke us.
[03:54:44.740 --> 03:54:47.441]  No, no, it's all Trump, folks.
[03:54:47.441 --> 03:54:48.682]  It's all Trump.

[03:55:48.089 --> 03:55:48.930]  Hey, have you heard?
[03:55:48.930 --> 03:55:58.197]  We knew this was coming, but now you've got the cities fighting back against President Trump trying to cut funding to sanctuary cities.
[03:55:58.197 --> 03:56:00.899]  So let's look at Chicago with Rahm Emanuel.
[03:56:02.028 --> 03:56:08.910]  Chicago is now thinking about suing the federal government over the threat to cut their federal funding.
[03:56:08.910 --> 03:56:10.451]  This is hilarious, folks.
[03:56:10.451 --> 03:56:12.492]  This is the Democrat Party.
[03:56:12.492 --> 03:56:15.053]  This is the liberals in a nutshell.
[03:56:15.053 --> 03:56:18.354]  You need look no further than this story right here.
[03:56:19.747 --> 03:56:23.249]  What are the entrails of this story?
[03:56:23.249 --> 03:56:25.871]  So, the federal government says, we're going to cut your funding.
[03:56:25.871 --> 03:56:30.213]  We're going to cut your federal funding if you're here taking care of non-citizens.
[03:56:30.213 --> 03:56:34.576]  See, we have this crazy new idea of putting America first in America.
[03:56:34.576 --> 03:56:39.518]  So, if you're not going to do that in your cities, Chicago, well then we're going to cut your federal funds.
[03:56:39.518 --> 03:56:43.501]  So, the federal government says, we're not going to give you this money to fund your police.
[03:56:44.386 --> 03:56:45.666]  In Chicago.
[03:56:45.666 --> 03:56:47.947]  So what is the response from Chicago?
[03:56:47.947 --> 03:56:51.287]  They say, well how dare you attack our police?
[03:56:51.287 --> 03:56:54.268]  How dare you come after our police like that?
[03:56:54.268 --> 03:56:55.408]  We're gonna sue you!
[03:56:55.408 --> 03:56:58.849]  No folks, you know what this is?
[03:56:58.849 --> 03:57:00.669]  This is Rahm Emanuel.
[03:57:00.669 --> 03:57:05.590]  This is the Democrat establishment in Chicago putting non-citizens above police.
[03:57:05.590 --> 03:57:06.851]  That's what this is.
[03:57:06.851 --> 03:57:12.692]  They would rather sue the federal government than have their police officers taken care of.
[03:57:12.692 --> 03:57:13.872]  This is the same city
[03:57:15.267 --> 03:57:20.590]  That has no-gun policies, strict gun laws, over 400 homicides this year!
[03:57:20.590 --> 03:57:29.374]  So, you want to look at how liberals' priorities rank, and what happens in liberal cities?
[03:57:29.374 --> 03:57:39.419]  Look no further than Chicago, where they put non-citizens, non-Americans, illegal non-citizens, lawbreakers, above police officers.
[03:57:39.419 --> 03:57:42.921]  A city where they continue to crack down with gun legislation,
[03:57:43.956 --> 03:57:48.899]  Yet have multiple homicides every weekend.
[03:57:48.899 --> 03:57:50.020]  So that's nice.
[03:57:50.020 --> 03:57:51.681]  Good for you, Rahm Emanuel.
[03:57:51.681 --> 03:57:53.422]  Glad to know where you stand.
[03:57:53.422 --> 03:57:57.485]  Non-citizens are more important than police officers in Chicago.
[03:57:57.485 --> 03:57:59.066]  You know what I would do if I was Chicago police?
[03:57:59.066 --> 03:58:01.707]  You know, this is where we need to start happening, folks.
[03:58:01.707 --> 03:58:07.231]  The police union, or whoever it is for the Chicago police, needs to take a stand now and need to say, you know what, Rahm Emanuel?
[03:58:08.243 --> 03:58:16.770]  You could get the funding if you would quit funding the non-citizens, but because you won't, we're not going to provide security for you anymore.
[03:58:16.770 --> 03:58:19.472]  Wonder what would happen to Rahm Emanuel then.
[03:58:19.472 --> 03:58:35.944]  Wonder what a Rahm Emanuel would do if the police said, sorry Rahm, we want to be putting ahead of non-citizens, so you go ahead and do your little lawsuit, but you're not going to have any protection going to court, you're not going to have any protection going to your mansion, you're not going to have any protection going to work.
[03:58:35.944 --> 03:58:37.726]  How do you think Rahm Emanuel would respond to that?
[03:58:38.166 --> 03:58:40.247]  Yeah, and he doesn't have guns to protect him anymore either.
[03:58:40.247 --> 03:58:43.610]  Thanks for tuning into the InfoWars Alex Jones Show.
