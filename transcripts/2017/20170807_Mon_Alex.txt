[00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:16.949]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.988]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're broadcasting worldwide on this Monday.
[00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:45.719]  Already the seventh day of August 2017.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.647]  Well, Peter Thiel has been hedging his bet on Donald Trump, telling folks publicly he thinks it's off to a terrific start, but hedging his bets 50-50, saying it's going to end in disaster.
[00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:59.131]  I'm going to tell you how the Trump administration is going to end one way or another when we come back.
[00:00:59.672 --> 00:01:01.994]  But first, the great news is this.
[00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:07.259]  The sleeping giant has awakened, and we can thank all of you out there and Donald Trump for that.
[00:01:11.244 --> 00:01:16.650]  Have you seen any Russians in West Virginia or Ohio or Pennsylvania?
[00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:20.654]  Are there any Russians here tonight?
[00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:21.595]  Any Russians?
[00:01:23.697 --> 00:01:26.980]  They can't beat us at the voting booths.
[00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:32.906]  So they're trying to cheat you out of the future and the future that you want.
[00:01:34.022 --> 00:01:42.285]  They're trying to cheat you out of the leadership you want with a fake story that is demeaning to all of us.
[00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:50.107]  And most importantly, demeaning to our country and demeaning to our Constitution.
[00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:55.169]  You know, I've begged Trump to do fireside chats at least twice a week.
[00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.210]  But really, these are fireside chats with studio audiences.
[00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.551]  He must do a weekly rally
[00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:08.766]  Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking
[00:02:37.193 --> 00:02:44.377]  Today I tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democrat governor.
[00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:51.321]  Record Democrats converting to Republicans.
[00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:53.702]  They've lost every special election.
[00:02:53.722 --> 00:02:55.043]  There's been more than a hundred of them.
[00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:57.564]  There's been four congressional special elections.
[00:02:58.125 --> 00:02:59.946]  All of them have been won by Trumpites.
[00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:04.904]  The Pauls are joining with Trump now, because they know he's for real?
[00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:09.188]  That's right, the Pauls, Rand Paul and others, are joining with Trump.
[00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:11.490]  We have to give our full support to Trump.
[00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:13.652]  I'm getting chills right now, this is so epic.
[00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:19.618]  Yeah, if you're not all in now, folks, do you know how much the globalists hate you, how much George Soros hates you?
[00:03:21.477 --> 00:03:23.078]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:26.981]  This is like serial killer child molesters want full control.
[00:03:27.261 --> 00:03:28.643]  And it turns out that's what they are.
[00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:32.525]  But they're up there on national TV saying it's the end of Trump, the end of Trump.
[00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:33.586]  Everyone hates him.
[00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:34.827]  His base is turning against him.
[00:03:35.287 --> 00:03:43.614]  And then we can go get the corporate numbers, the inside numbers, the bot numbers, the computer numbers, just like we did during the campaign.
[00:03:43.634 --> 00:03:47.657]  And it shows Trump as popular as he's ever been, except for maybe
[00:03:49.184 --> 00:03:51.727]  Inauguration day and nomination day.
[00:03:52.368 --> 00:03:57.553]  I mean, those were his all-time highs.
[00:03:57.593 --> 00:04:00.256]  But all the AI systems predicted his win.
[00:04:01.478 --> 00:04:04.120]  And then you just see the numbers online and the support.
[00:04:04.821 --> 00:04:06.063]  It's only intensified.
[00:04:06.503 --> 00:04:08.806]  I saw his support dip big time.
[00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:19.679]  When he supported the bad version of Obamacare bill because he was lied to about what was in it and then came out and said I was lied to and then by the fourth version it was something Rand Paul said was good.
[00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.540]  And you notice the Republicans wouldn't pass it because they wanted to screw people, the Republican leadership.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.721]  The Freedom Caucus supported it.
[00:04:27.261 --> 00:04:34.023]  Just like the Democrats have all gotten together and have agreed to just engage in criminal activity with the media.
[00:04:36.064 --> 00:04:41.567]  And to just do things they've never done before because it's seen as acceptable to be completely criminal.
[00:04:42.888 --> 00:04:51.193]  In this jihad of trying to keep the sleeping giant from awakening, the Lilliputians are in full panic mode.
[00:04:53.154 --> 00:04:54.735]  You're in Gulliver's travel world.
[00:04:54.955 --> 00:04:55.795]  What is this thing?
[00:04:55.915 --> 00:04:56.856]  Where are you from?
[00:04:56.936 --> 00:04:58.497]  I'm from the island of Manhattan.
[00:04:58.557 --> 00:04:59.737]  Were you the president?
[00:05:00.038 --> 00:05:03.239]  I was actually known as President the... Awesome.
[00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:10.463]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of brain force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[00:05:10.763 --> 00:05:15.004]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken.
[00:05:15.384 --> 00:05:20.486]  And it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[00:05:20.546 --> 00:05:23.526]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[00:05:23.786 --> 00:05:25.007]  It's Brain Force Plus.

[00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:50.932]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:05:51.212 --> 00:05:55.915]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:06:10.064 --> 00:06:16.928]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:39.494]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[00:06:40.294 --> 00:06:43.216]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[00:06:43.896 --> 00:06:46.678]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[00:06:47.318 --> 00:06:52.181]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:58.843]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[00:06:59.203 --> 00:07:04.405]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball whack.
[00:07:05.065 --> 00:07:08.466]  That's why I recommend Emerix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.

[00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:46.253]  This is the Infowar.
[00:08:03.527 --> 00:08:05.189]  This is a national emergency.
[00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.392]  Important instructions will follow.
[00:08:07.613 --> 00:08:08.534]  Shots fired.
[00:08:20.993 --> 00:08:27.177]  This message is transmitted at the request of the President of the United States of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[00:08:27.617 --> 00:08:33.580]  In compliance with the United Nations, the President of the United States has declared martial law.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.142]  Curfew is now in place.
[00:08:37.302 --> 00:08:38.743]  Return to your homes.
[00:09:12.508 --> 00:09:16.452]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:09:17.512 --> 00:09:19.354]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:09:24.426 --> 00:09:25.787]  Zack, this is Crystal Palace.
[00:09:25.927 --> 00:09:26.067]  Inc.
[00:09:26.087 --> 00:09:27.627]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.
[00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:29.388]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:09:29.888 --> 00:09:31.729]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:09:33.369 --> 00:09:36.930]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War 3.
[00:09:37.871 --> 00:09:39.331]  Target selection complete.
[00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:42.612]  Time-on-target sequence complete.
[00:09:42.632 --> 00:09:48.134]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[00:09:48.334 --> 00:09:53.196]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.391]  From the front lines of the Information War.
[00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:00.632]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[00:10:00.692 --> 00:10:02.072]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[00:10:02.312 --> 00:10:06.753]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[00:10:06.773 --> 00:10:07.393]  You bet!
[00:10:07.893 --> 00:10:12.054]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:10:12.194 --> 00:10:15.155]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[00:10:16.355 --> 00:10:18.956]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[00:10:20.596 --> 00:10:22.517]  Shall we play a game?
[00:10:22.737 --> 00:10:23.297]  How about...
[00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:33.139]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:10:33.439 --> 00:10:35.460]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.301]  Awaiting launch codes.
[00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:38.502]  We are on a launch mode.
[00:10:38.962 --> 00:10:42.564]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[00:10:42.884 --> 00:10:46.806]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:10:47.246 --> 00:10:47.567]  We're in!
[00:10:48.727 --> 00:10:50.488]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[00:10:50.508 --> 00:10:52.668]  We have Soviet submarine watch detection.
[00:10:53.068 --> 00:10:54.749]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[00:10:55.109 --> 00:10:56.569]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[00:11:13.514 --> 00:11:16.295]  The problem with not playing the game is the Clintons
[00:11:17.793 --> 00:11:30.321]  And the same genius globalists that have got us into this situation we're currently in are the ones that gave North Korea the ICBMs and the nuclear reactors to be able to produce the fissile material.
[00:11:31.382 --> 00:11:40.908]  And they gave these individuals that can't even manufacture their own automobile, that can't even make their own power transformers,
[00:11:41.974 --> 00:11:44.455]  They can't even produce their own telephone lines.
[00:11:44.595 --> 00:11:46.637]  They have to ship it all in.
[00:11:47.237 --> 00:11:52.620]  But they got lots of uniforms and lots of artillery and lots of forced labor camps and death camps.
[00:11:54.281 --> 00:12:00.764]  And now they've got ICBMs that it's taken them more than 16, 17 years to even learn how to use.
[00:12:02.405 --> 00:12:04.066]  And they produce the fissile material.
[00:12:06.109 --> 00:12:14.393]  And the plan was the strategy of tension to bring in global government, to bring in more UN control, to clean up the North Korean problem.
[00:12:14.653 --> 00:12:25.198]  That's why they call it the strategy of tension and the strategy of patience and all this other garbage creating worldwide crises and then offering their solutions.
[00:12:26.659 --> 00:12:28.280]  And North Korea is in the news today.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.160]  This is from Reuters.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.841]  North Korea ready to teach U.S.
[00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:32.982]  a severe lesson with nuclear weapons.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.564]  And of course they're criticizing the UN abused its authority.
[00:12:39.965 --> 00:12:45.912]  Because finally even the UN and China are saying that North Korea is out of control.
[00:12:46.593 --> 00:12:51.017]  Because Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un's father, was under China's control.
[00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:56.984]  Kim Jong-un, to a great extent, is not under their control and is out of his mind.
[00:12:58.527 --> 00:13:03.250]  And the clock is ticking on President Trump and the world having to do something about it.
[00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:17.559]  And it sits fairly and squarely at the feet of the Clintons and the globalists and the ideology of communism visited upon the planet by US and British and German intellectuals in the last 150 years.
[00:13:20.819 --> 00:13:22.320]  Revenge will be thousand-fold.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:31.324]  Both three avows to attack America, as Kim Jong-un demands justice for Donald Trump, trying to isolate and stifle his country.
[00:13:32.724 --> 00:13:34.986]  Boy, you talk about projection.
[00:13:36.746 --> 00:13:43.069]  Isolating, stifling your country under Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist malice oppression?
[00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.351]  Where you grow fat off the blood of your people?
[00:13:46.371 --> 00:13:48.872]  And they're taught that you're a god?
[00:13:52.079 --> 00:14:03.609]  And we have the bizarrest, absurdest vision of you hobbling around with your childhood idol, Dennis Rodman?
[00:14:08.053 --> 00:14:08.593]  Incredible!
[00:14:09.454 --> 00:14:11.355]  But that's the cult of big government!
[00:14:11.475 --> 00:14:12.436]  That's what they want!
[00:14:13.097 --> 00:14:14.098]  It's what they're pushing!
[00:14:15.579 --> 00:14:20.063]  And it's where all forms of centralization lead, pure, unadulterated,
[00:14:21.112 --> 00:14:29.838]  Authoritarianism with a spoiled, rotten elite on top and a giant, unwashed, dumbed-down, enslaved mass on the bottom.
[00:14:29.878 --> 00:14:31.520]  And that's what we're fighting existentially.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:46.751]  Now, before I get into all the ultra-massive news today, obviously, thematically, you've got former Reagan administration officials, former Clinton administration officials, former CIA directors, former directors of national intelligence.
[00:14:47.271 --> 00:14:49.313]  You've got all the big cheeses.
[00:14:51.457 --> 00:15:13.889]  In the news, it's up on Infowars.com, a Paul Joseph Watson article, and they are saying that the preparations to remove President Trump in the near future are underway.
[00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:17.652]  There's the headline, ex-Reagan official, Trump to be gone by February.
[00:15:17.712 --> 00:15:19.893]  The swamp will make mincemeat of him.
[00:15:22.523 --> 00:15:29.806]  Now, that said, I have been publicly begging the president to launch his own media operation to have fireside chats.
[00:15:31.967 --> 00:15:40.930]  They have done something along those lines with the announcement of Real News, a once a week, hour-long program.
[00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:43.331]  It's going to start 30 minutes, move to an hour.
[00:15:43.351 --> 00:15:45.852]  They've hired a former CNN reporter.
[00:15:48.018 --> 00:15:51.640]  Basically a teleprompter reader to read and break down the clips.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:16:02.126]  And guaranteed with his 60-something million followers on Twitter alone, under his two accounts, and you count the rest of his family, 80 million.
[00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:08.149]  If they don't stifle and block it, it will have the most views of anything in the world.
[00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:14.773]  I mean, already when Trump puts out videos and puts out speeches, they get seen tens of millions of times outside of mainstream media.
[00:16:15.193 --> 00:16:17.254]  And of course, CNN panicked.
[00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:22.563]  Presidents could have fireside chats with Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
[00:16:23.884 --> 00:16:28.587]  They could have weekly radio addresses, but they're saying this is state-run media, this is pure evil.
[00:16:28.647 --> 00:16:45.199]  No, state-run media is the CIA-established State Department office under Obama that's still operating, trying to stop independent media in America, and the media demonizing Rex Tillerson because he's not letting them spend the money, or letting the FCC come in and try to shut down free press.
[00:16:45.839 --> 00:17:02.852]  I mean they're in the news with a straight face saying shut down the independent free press and now they are going into hysterical gesticulations and flip-flopping and gnashing of teeth and running around like the proverbial chicken with the head lopped off.
[00:17:04.514 --> 00:17:06.315]  Stories up on InfoWars.com.
[00:17:07.236 --> 00:17:09.338]  We've got the announcement
[00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:13.193]  And then we've got all of the freaking out.
[00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:16.916]  But here is Trump launches the real news broadcast.
[00:17:16.936 --> 00:17:19.099]  I'm going to play that clip, but just think about this.
[00:17:19.659 --> 00:17:25.805]  This is only a program once a week to actually show the real accomplishments and then interface with the public.
[00:17:27.387 --> 00:17:30.370]  I mean, Obama had massive teams putting out his own propaganda.
[00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.592]  The difference was no one wanted to watch it.
[00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:36.229]  And so the president more and more is isolated.
[00:17:36.949 --> 00:17:40.951]  Fox News is clearly showing its colors right now, except for Sean Hannity, basically.
[00:17:43.432 --> 00:17:46.293]  And this is the right move, but it needs to be more than this.
[00:17:46.813 --> 00:17:51.215]  And this is what Scaramucci wanted to do, and this is why the power structure feared him so much.
[00:17:51.255 --> 00:17:55.016]  But this is Scaramucci's plan going into function.
[00:17:57.383 --> 00:18:04.164]  But we need Trump every week addressing people point-blank with a stack of news articles, holding them up, going through the lies.
[00:18:05.765 --> 00:18:08.825]  When they say he hasn't accomplished anything, go through what he's accomplished.
[00:18:10.685 --> 00:18:11.286]  Things like that.
[00:18:11.326 --> 00:18:16.706]  When they say that, you know, they're trying to cheerlead the fall of the economy, he needs to be there exposing who did it.
[00:18:17.947 --> 00:18:18.927]  Those are the big issues.
[00:18:19.967 --> 00:18:22.267]  But this is the right direction, this is a really great move.
[00:18:22.608 --> 00:18:24.788]  Here it is, Trump launches Real News Broadcast.
[00:18:26.715 --> 00:18:28.356]  Hey everybody, I'm Kayleigh McEnany.
[00:18:28.416 --> 00:18:32.798]  Thank you for joining us as we provide you the news of the week from Trump Tower here in New York.
[00:18:33.719 --> 00:18:35.420]  More great economic news on Friday.
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:40.382]  The July jobs report added a better-than-expected 209,000 jobs.
[00:18:40.922 --> 00:18:45.865]  Overall, since the president took office, President Trump has created more than 1 million jobs.
[00:18:46.465 --> 00:18:51.811]  The unemployment rate is at a 16-year low and consumer confidence is at a 16-year high.
[00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:54.834]  All while the Dow Jones continues to break records.
[00:18:55.194 --> 00:18:58.758]  President Trump has clearly steered the economy back in the right direction.
[00:18:59.739 --> 00:19:02.282]  On Wednesday, the president introduced the RAISE Act.
[00:19:02.802 --> 00:19:07.706]  For decades, a steady rise in immigration has depressed the wages of American workers.
[00:19:08.146 --> 00:19:13.690]  The RAISE Act will increase wages, decrease poverty, and save the taxpayers billions.
[00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:19.034]  Americans deserve a raise, and President Trump is finally putting the American worker first.
[00:19:19.989 --> 00:19:26.771]  Also on Wednesday, President Trump awarded the Medal of Honor to one of our Vietnam War heroes, Specialist 5 James McCloughan.
[00:19:27.111 --> 00:19:31.413]  McCloughan risked his life on nine separate occasions, saving many of his wounded peers.
[00:19:31.933 --> 00:19:39.816]  President Trump also honored veterans as a whole with yet another VA reform package that will enable millions of veterans to receive better access to care.
[00:19:40.236 --> 00:19:46.998]  President Trump is dedicated to honoring these men and women who fought valiantly for our country and ensuring that they receive the care that they deserve.
[00:19:47.618 --> 00:19:48.940]  Thank you for joining us everybody.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.483]  I'm Kayleigh McEnany and that is The Real News.
[00:19:51.503 --> 00:20:01.716]  This is just the embryonic kickoff but it's got CNN, MSNBC having convulsions because the fake news can't believe that Trump's gonna have his own voice.
[00:20:11.263 --> 00:20:15.346]  Jones is a charismatic performer who gets charged up on a regular basis.
[00:20:15.426 --> 00:20:16.326]  They call that crazy.
[00:20:16.346 --> 00:20:17.187]  That's not crazy.
[00:20:17.407 --> 00:20:21.249]  That's my will, my human spirit saying crush those that would hurt the innocent.
[00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:22.550]  Go after the enemy.
[00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.111]  Build a civilization.
[00:20:24.171 --> 00:20:24.891]  Be honorable.
[00:20:25.572 --> 00:20:26.993]  Crush the snakes under your feet.
[00:20:27.233 --> 00:20:28.854]  People want legitimacy.
[00:20:28.934 --> 00:20:29.935]  They want real.
[00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:39.088]  Two-thirds of his funding reportedly comes from selling his products, which he sells on his site under his Infowars Life brand.
[00:20:39.348 --> 00:20:42.349]  Particularly, vitamins and nutraceuticals.
[00:20:42.709 --> 00:20:43.670]  A whole bunch!
[00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.050]  Now, let me break them down for you.
[00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:57.594]  There is a Super Male Vitality, a Super Female Vitality, Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee, Lung Cleanse, Brain Force Plus, something called DNA Force that costs $120 a bottle,
[00:20:59.455 --> 00:21:06.718]  And Child Ease, a herbal blend which, according to InfoWars, is designed to soothe the mind and bodies of children.
[00:21:07.478 --> 00:21:18.442]  And then there is Caveman True Paleo Formula with Bone Broth, a chocolate-flavoured drink mix made from bee pollen, stevia and the dust of chicken skeletons.
[00:21:19.062 --> 00:21:25.064]  Now, according to InfoWars, it is one of the most popular new health trends in the world today.
[00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:28.085]  And if you have never gone shopping on InfoWars,
[00:21:28.425 --> 00:21:40.857]  You are in for a treat, because there's the kind of survival gear that you would expect, alongside more surprising items like organic shampoo, body wash, and deodorant, as well as products like Combat One Tactical Bath Wipes.
[00:21:41.437 --> 00:21:46.462]  He does have a medical expert who consults on many of his supplements, Dr. Edward Groot III.
[00:21:46.622 --> 00:21:48.544]  See, the media makes fun of you and says that you're an idiot.
[00:21:49.045 --> 00:21:53.168]  He looks like a fifth-year senior at the University of Falling-Off-a-Surfboard.
[00:21:54.389 --> 00:21:54.829]  That's right.
[00:21:54.849 --> 00:21:57.010]  I mean, literally, they say we cannot sell coffee.
[00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.570]  It's a fraud.
[00:21:58.091 --> 00:22:00.131]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
[00:22:00.151 --> 00:22:01.572]  Maybe you've had back pain before.
[00:22:01.592 --> 00:22:02.872]  Maybe you've had nerves that were cut off.
[00:22:03.873 --> 00:22:04.853]  This creates tingling.
[00:22:04.873 --> 00:22:06.614]  A lot of people have their feeling come back.
[00:22:06.694 --> 00:22:07.674]  I'm not going to make claims.
[00:22:07.974 --> 00:22:08.914]  This research is true.
[00:22:09.895 --> 00:22:11.495]  Organically based bio PQQ.
[00:22:11.775 --> 00:22:14.036]  And you can only find its ingredients in comets.
[00:22:14.896 --> 00:22:15.977]  Oh, and blueberries.
[00:22:21.418 --> 00:22:24.119]  His products are different than the ones you can find in stores.
[00:22:24.279 --> 00:22:28.241]  It is absolutely in the crystalline form, the strongest, you absorb it.
[00:22:28.721 --> 00:22:33.103]  So, folks, don't go out to the store and get iodine and say, one of the big chains, it'll kill you.
[00:22:33.783 --> 00:22:34.804]  Wow!
[00:22:35.864 --> 00:22:39.646]  I honestly did not know that you could imply your competition kills people.
[00:22:40.786 --> 00:22:45.749]  We sell five different brands of the very best water filtration systems out there.
[00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:46.469]  They're amazing.
[00:22:46.509 --> 00:22:51.552]  They cut out 99.99% of the glyphosate, the herbicides, the pesticides, the fluoride.
[00:22:51.692 --> 00:22:55.314]  Jones is talking about the globalists systematically feminizing us.
[00:22:55.474 --> 00:22:59.977]  Chemicals are being placed in the water to feminize society and reduce the population.
[00:23:00.077 --> 00:23:03.139]  His products are marked up just enough to keep his business going.
[00:23:03.499 --> 00:23:05.500]  Well, the money that's made is pretty much put back into the bank.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:12.486]  In fact, as he frequently tells his audience, he needs them to buy more to keep his truth-telling crusade solvent and growing.
[00:23:13.287 --> 00:23:16.390]  We need to fund ourselves, and we fund ourselves by you buying the products.
[00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:20.714]  We're at a shortfall now because of the massive sustained economic attacks we're under.
[00:23:20.874 --> 00:23:22.675]  I could have sponsors every segment.
[00:23:22.816 --> 00:23:23.336]  I don't do it.
[00:23:23.716 --> 00:23:24.897]  I plug enough to fund things.
[00:23:25.558 --> 00:23:25.978]  Exactly!
[00:23:26.018 --> 00:23:29.639]  It's like an NPR pledge drive for people who hate NPR.
[00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:38.281]  Why not pick up a Bill Clinton rape whistle which, according to Infowars, should be used to let Bill know you're in the crowd and that you know the truth.
[00:23:38.301 --> 00:23:39.301]  That truth, by the way,
[00:23:55.442 --> 00:24:04.049]  Nobody can dispute the fact that we... And by the way, our order came with a free 9-11-was-an-inside-job bumper sticker.
[00:24:11.318 --> 00:24:12.778]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:13.359 --> 00:24:15.259]  We got a bunch of guests joining us today.
[00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:22.661]  A ton of mainstream announcements that they have a plan to forcibly outside the Constitution remove President Trump.
[00:24:23.281 --> 00:24:24.842]  It's an incredible time to be alive.
[00:24:24.862 --> 00:24:30.043]  The latest on North Korea, the latest on what's happening with the economy, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:24:30.103 --> 00:24:32.263]  It's all coming up.
[00:24:33.484 --> 00:24:37.905]  But getting back into Trump, launching the embryonic beginnings
[00:24:39.446 --> 00:24:42.929]  Of a weekly news program that simply looks at the accomplishments.
[00:24:42.969 --> 00:24:44.129]  Now, why is this so important?
[00:24:45.991 --> 00:24:52.915]  With his two different Twitter accounts, way over 60 million followers, they're now blocking his Twitter account.
[00:24:52.935 --> 00:24:56.298]  They're now auto-disliking it, even when you click that you like it.
[00:24:56.338 --> 00:25:01.281]  Kind of like a voting machine when you vote for a Libertarian or Conservative and it makes you vote for the Democrat.
[00:25:02.122 --> 00:25:05.384]  Like happened in so many states where you try to vote for Trump and it would go vote for Hillary.
[00:25:05.704 --> 00:25:07.746]  Or you tried to vote for Sanders and it would vote for Hillary.
[00:25:08.965 --> 00:25:14.969]  Or the nominees would give her the nomination, but then they just ignored that and had the superdelegates take it away.
[00:25:15.009 --> 00:25:15.809]  It's the same deal.
[00:25:17.771 --> 00:25:22.674]  You're hitting A, they're giving you B. You go left, they go right.
[00:25:22.714 --> 00:25:23.754]  You go up, they go down.
[00:25:25.395 --> 00:25:26.636]  You go high, they go lower.
[00:25:29.778 --> 00:25:35.562]  So, breaking Twitter censors, Eric Trump's tweet of the Drudge Report that simply sent out
[00:25:36.974 --> 00:25:45.700]  The federal government's own Congressional Budget Office numbers on the economy roaring back last Friday.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.623]  And it said this tweet is not available.
[00:25:49.643 --> 00:25:52.285]  Then we got screenshots of what it was.
[00:25:52.325 --> 00:25:53.706]  It was a link to the drugs report.
[00:25:55.027 --> 00:25:56.968]  And they said this is not acceptable.
[00:25:57.008 --> 00:25:57.788]  This is sensitive.
[00:25:58.489 --> 00:25:59.690]  This is in the hate area.
[00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:05.414]  So, the great crime now is that Trump would have an info babe
[00:26:07.847 --> 00:26:22.272]  Read off a few of the accomplishments and point out when you open your country up to unfettered third world population drive, you will lower your standards, you will lower your overall wages and what the wages can buy.
[00:26:23.793 --> 00:26:26.374]  And we're going with the model of Australia and Canada that have
[00:26:27.361 --> 00:26:34.308]  Open borders, but to skilled workers or to students and people that don't have medical issues.
[00:26:34.949 --> 00:26:37.571]  You know, people that contribute to your country.
[00:26:38.432 --> 00:26:43.657]  But see, oh no, you've got to take that and turn it upside down like it's some great evil.
[00:26:44.502 --> 00:26:50.866]  So let's go to CNN first flipping out over Trump's Real News broadcast.
[00:26:50.906 --> 00:26:56.510]  How dare him have his own video he puts out that they're going to have more trouble censoring.
[00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.391]  They're so scared.
[00:26:58.922 --> 00:27:03.524]  There's also this new development just in the past hour or so that I want to show all of you.
[00:27:03.884 --> 00:27:10.066]  Kayleigh McEnany, who wasn't until recently a CNN commentator, seems to have joined the Trump re-election campaign.
[00:27:10.647 --> 00:27:16.309]  She's in a new video on Trump's Facebook page this morning presenting what looks a lot like a newscast.
[00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:17.929]  Let's watch and then discuss.
[00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.091]  Hey everybody, I'm Kayleigh McEnany.
[00:27:22.131 --> 00:27:26.473]  Thank you for joining us as we provide you the news of the week from Trump Tower here in New York.
[00:27:27.429 --> 00:27:29.130]  More great economic news on Friday.
[00:27:29.291 --> 00:27:34.094]  The July jobs report added a better than expected 209,000 jobs.
[00:27:35.736 --> 00:27:38.218]  Looks like a newscast has the graphical... Hit pause again!
[00:27:39.585 --> 00:27:40.366]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[00:27:40.726 --> 00:28:03.505]  Notice he said, looks like a newscast, has the graphics of a newscast, and we've got to use that clip every time now when CNN gets caught in a bunch of lies, and just put it all together, showing CNN caught in another lie, CNN caught in another retraction, CNN caught staging the debate, CNN caught giving the questions to Donna Brazile, CNN caught with fake polls, CNN caught faking location.
[00:28:04.813 --> 00:28:24.238]  CNN caught, CNN caught, CNN caught, CNN caught, and then just keep cutting back to Super Mr. Potato Head, excuse me, I meant Humpty Dumpty, sitting up there, Baby Hippo, whatever his name is, saying, looks like a real newscast, the graphics, but is it?
[00:28:25.439 --> 00:28:30.040]  Cutting into those job numbers, because they don't want you to get those job numbers.
[00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.281]  They want to show you, her giving you a little bit of them, and then imply it's fake.
[00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:38.633]  Is the $4 trillion in the stock market fake too?
[00:28:38.653 --> 00:28:41.957]  Or the 69% in illegals coming across down?
[00:28:42.457 --> 00:28:45.000]  Or ISIS basically defeated?
[00:28:45.481 --> 00:28:52.009]  Or the Second Amendment now not under as great an attack?
[00:28:52.109 --> 00:28:53.711]  Let's finish up with Super Mr. Potato Head.
[00:28:54.670 --> 00:29:02.212]  ...like a newscast, has the graphical appearance, sounds like a newscast, but obviously, Jeff Greenfield, uh, it's a promotional effort... Hey, pause again.
[00:29:02.672 --> 00:29:04.233]  Obviously it's a promotional effort.
[00:29:04.433 --> 00:29:05.853]  What are you a promotional effort for?
[00:29:05.913 --> 00:29:06.654]  Globalism!
[00:29:07.054 --> 00:29:08.874]  The special interest that have hijacked this country.
[00:29:08.914 --> 00:29:09.334]  Back it up.
[00:29:09.355 --> 00:29:18.517]  Let's, let's play the three people, looks like a newscast, sounds like a newscast, and everybody knows you are the name in anti-American, anti-truth news.
[00:29:18.837 --> 00:29:22.018]  CNN is the gold standard of baloney.
[00:29:22.218 --> 00:29:23.659]  Let's finish up with fake news CNN.
[00:29:24.272 --> 00:29:34.100]  ...like a newscast, has the graphical appearance, sounds like a newscast, but obviously, Jeff Greenfield, it's a promotional effort either for the Trump re-election campaign or the Republican National Committee.
[00:29:34.381 --> 00:29:35.001]  What do you make of it?
[00:29:35.181 --> 00:29:35.622]  Not much.
[00:29:35.822 --> 00:29:37.823]  I mean, look at what's behind her.
[00:29:38.744 --> 00:29:42.848]  Campaigns have been trying to do news-like videos ever since there was videos.
[00:29:42.928 --> 00:29:47.832]  In the scheme of things, that doesn't strike me as a particularly bothersome problem.
[00:29:48.132 --> 00:29:50.094]  But the president's railed against fake news.
[00:29:50.134 --> 00:29:51.816]  Isn't this a sign that he's... We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.896 --> 00:29:53.338]  It's more than acting confident.
[00:29:53.558 --> 00:29:54.419]  Oh, we're number one.
[00:29:54.479 --> 00:29:56.582]  Everybody hates us, but we're number one.
[00:29:56.622 --> 00:29:57.343]  We'll be back, folks.
[00:30:03.996 --> 00:30:10.881]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[00:30:11.161 --> 00:30:20.867]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken, and it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[00:30:20.947 --> 00:30:23.929]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.390]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[00:30:25.811 --> 00:30:33.536]  Read thousands of five-star independent reviews right now and get your Brain Force Plus at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:34.116 --> 00:30:46.240]  Since the time of Hippocrates, the father of modern western medicine, in 420 BC, the ancients have marveled at the power of whey protein from milk and cheese.
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:53.782]  That's why I'm so proud to announce the latest addition to the InfoWarsLife family, true whey protein from InfoWarsLife.
[00:30:54.122 --> 00:31:00.066]  It's produced right here in the United States of America under the strictest high-quality organic conditions.
[00:31:00.627 --> 00:31:07.371]  Our True Whey Protein from Infowars Life contains a whopping 20 grams of protein per serving.
[00:31:07.811 --> 00:31:15.036]  We went out and did massive research and found the very best company and facility to develop our whey.
[00:31:15.197 --> 00:31:21.501]  And it took us years to finally get contacts with some of the larger, most respected companies
[00:31:21.841 --> 00:31:27.828]  To bring you a super high quality whey protein at a very reasonable price.
[00:31:28.349 --> 00:31:35.917]  That way you get the benefits and the taste of high quality whey while supporting our information warfare operation against the globalists.
[00:31:36.238 --> 00:31:38.721]  Doing our research, one thing continued to really stand out.
[00:31:39.281 --> 00:31:47.967]  It's not just that cows and their milk are associated with the best, highest quality protein, but also that those cows be grass-fed.
[00:31:48.367 --> 00:31:49.188]  That is essential.
[00:31:49.568 --> 00:31:53.871]  And all of this whey protein comes from grass-fed, happy cows.
[00:31:54.351 --> 00:31:56.793]  This is the very best whey that we were able to bring to market.
[00:31:57.153 --> 00:31:58.854]  Please try it for yourself and tell us what you think.
[00:31:58.874 --> 00:32:00.596]  Again, thank you so much for all your support.
[00:32:01.136 --> 00:32:03.658]  It is true whey from mfulwhoreslife.com.
[00:32:04.278 --> 00:32:07.802]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:32:08.262 --> 00:32:14.308]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:17.512]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:17.912 --> 00:32:20.915]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:32:21.115 --> 00:32:24.559]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:32:24.899 --> 00:32:25.360]  The left
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.621]  ...controls culture.
[00:32:26.661 --> 00:32:27.641]  They control arts.
[00:32:27.702 --> 00:32:28.922]  They control entertainment.
[00:32:29.223 --> 00:32:36.307]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:32:36.367 --> 00:32:38.769]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:32:39.249 --> 00:32:43.112]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:32:43.172 --> 00:32:45.234]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[00:32:45.854 --> 00:32:51.236]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[00:32:51.496 --> 00:32:57.738]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:32:57.818 --> 00:32:59.519]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:32:59.659 --> 00:33:00.859]  It's available right now.
[00:33:01.159 --> 00:33:03.700]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[00:33:09.522 --> 00:33:11.863]  Is this new?
[00:33:12.163 --> 00:33:13.724]  It's so good, but it's not good.
[00:33:15.089 --> 00:33:25.235]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[00:33:27.339 --> 00:33:30.661]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[00:33:31.081 --> 00:33:34.323]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[00:33:34.703 --> 00:33:36.844]  It's a military mission in North St.
[00:33:36.884 --> 00:33:37.244]  Louis.
[00:33:37.544 --> 00:33:39.825]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[00:33:40.106 --> 00:33:44.588]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[00:33:44.768 --> 00:33:49.270]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.411]  Guns will be taken.
[00:33:50.451 --> 00:33:51.651]  No one will ever be armed.
[00:33:51.931 --> 00:33:52.912]  We will take all weapons.
[00:33:53.132 --> 00:33:55.454]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[00:33:55.514 --> 00:33:59.897]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[00:34:00.077 --> 00:34:00.357]  Enough.
[00:34:00.937 --> 00:34:01.198]  Enough.
[00:34:01.738 --> 00:34:02.018]  Enough.
[00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:03.019]  Enough.
[00:34:03.159 --> 00:34:07.642]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[00:34:07.722 --> 00:34:11.685]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[00:34:12.085 --> 00:34:19.091]  NSK's Late News 12's Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[00:34:19.271 --> 00:34:27.158]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:34:27.298 --> 00:34:29.880]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[00:34:30.901 --> 00:34:32.482]  Somebody else made that happen.
[00:34:33.343 --> 00:34:39.332]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:34:39.632 --> 00:34:44.279]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[00:34:44.579 --> 00:34:49.246]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[00:34:57.003 --> 00:35:02.010]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[00:35:02.451 --> 00:35:03.813]  You're in your apartment!
[00:35:03.873 --> 00:35:04.855]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[00:35:04.975 --> 00:35:05.876]  Go back inside right now!
[00:35:06.016 --> 00:35:06.757]  I am inside.
[00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:08.099]  I have two words for you.
[00:35:08.941 --> 00:35:09.782]  Predator blows.
[00:35:10.763 --> 00:35:11.785]  You will never see it coming.
[00:35:15.805 --> 00:35:18.266]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[00:35:18.666 --> 00:35:27.810]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses, and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:33.152]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[00:35:33.372 --> 00:35:38.134]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[00:35:38.434 --> 00:35:40.495]  If you want them, come and take them!
[00:35:42.219 --> 00:35:43.583]  We are on the march.
[00:35:43.903 --> 00:35:46.489]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:51.521]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:36:06.324 --> 00:36:11.369]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:15.153]  This is the heart of 1776!
[00:36:19.617 --> 00:36:28.065]  But this is where the work of Robert Mueller is critical to our future as a country because I, you know, in some respects we're a government and a nation in crisis right now.
[00:36:29.164 --> 00:36:31.466]  You have confidence in this special counsel?
[00:36:31.626 --> 00:36:32.387]  Absolutely.
[00:36:32.707 --> 00:36:34.969]  You both worked with him for a long time when he was head of the FBI.
[00:36:35.049 --> 00:36:35.450]  Absolutely.
[00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:37.371]  It was an inspired choice.
[00:36:37.631 --> 00:36:38.352]  They don't come any better.
[00:36:39.413 --> 00:36:45.038]  Nobody better than Bob Mueller, who is a straight shooter and will not be intimidated by anything.
[00:36:45.238 --> 00:36:53.806]  And if he's fired by Mr. Trump, or attempted to be fired by Mr. Trump, I hope, I really hope that our members of Congress, our elected representatives, are going to stand up and say enough is enough.
[00:36:54.466 --> 00:37:01.713]  And stop making apologies and excuses for things that are happening that really flout, I think, our system of laws and government here.
[00:37:01.753 --> 00:37:14.606]  When you say enough is enough, if he's fired, and he's the President of the United States, he could tell Rosenstein to fire him if he wants, but if he's fired, what would you want Congress to do?
[00:37:15.951 --> 00:37:24.677]  First of all, I think it's the obligation of some executive branch officials to refuse to carry out some of these orders that, again, are inconsistent with what this country is all about.
[00:37:25.678 --> 00:37:39.128]  But I would just hope that this is not going to be a partisan issue, that Republicans and Democrats are going to see that the future of this country is at stake, and there needs to be some things done for the good of the future.
[00:37:40.369 --> 00:37:44.232]  Now that's Brennan, who converted to Islam, and he's up there with Clapper.
[00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:47.851]  Who lied to Congress and said the NSA doesn't spy on the American people.
[00:37:48.572 --> 00:37:55.537]  These are the folks with Mueller that took Islam off the list, radical Islam, off the list of terror groups when it's 99% of the terror.
[00:37:56.258 --> 00:38:11.270]  I mean, these are the people that protected the Clintons through their rampage of criminal activity, through the out-of-control orgy of looting and other felony-type behavior by Obama.
[00:38:12.281 --> 00:38:21.364]  The funding of the Muslim Brotherhood, the funding of the overthrow of our allies, the complete opening of our borders, letting criminals flood in, killing all vetting.
[00:38:22.185 --> 00:38:24.726]  It just goes on and on, the crimes these people have committed.
[00:38:24.986 --> 00:38:36.310]  And then they sit up there and point their finger at Trump with Mueller, who now doesn't have any Russia evidence, so he is expanding
[00:38:40.103 --> 00:38:50.414]  To the friends, the family, the neighbors, the renters, everybody on the campaign looking for perjury, looking for money laundering, looking for somebody that embezzled $1,000.
[00:38:53.345 --> 00:38:56.646]  It's the exact same thing that's happening with Benjamin Netanyahu right now.
[00:38:56.966 --> 00:39:14.792]  Whether you love Benjamin Netanyahu or hate Benjamin Netanyahu, I always notice that a big segment of the right wing hated Netanyahu and put Israel in one big monolithic group and made it a touchstone or a sacrament to say Netanyahu ran everything.
[00:39:15.212 --> 00:39:17.913]  Well, the big Rothschild liberal globalist
[00:39:19.139 --> 00:39:24.844]  Soros Combine that we know from the WikiLeaks wants to destroy Israel and that is allied with Islam.
[00:39:24.864 --> 00:39:27.907]  Because they got more money and more people.
[00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:29.508]  Because of the oil.
[00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:37.795]  They are trying to get rid of Netanyahu in the same thing they've done with special prosecutors and special investigators for years.
[00:39:38.356 --> 00:39:44.001]  And they finally got one of his deputies to plead guilty to some shady business dealings that are very moderate.
[00:39:46.485 --> 00:39:50.128]  And this guy, I went and actually researched it.
[00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:55.653]  This Israeli saying, you know, none of this has anything to do with Netanyahu.
[00:39:56.074 --> 00:40:00.037]  But the news here and in Israel is saying, oh, it's over for Netanyahu.
[00:40:00.418 --> 00:40:08.164]  His chief aide, former aide, has pled guilty for a light sentence, just probation and a fine for things he's done.
[00:40:08.385 --> 00:40:09.886]  But then you actually go read the guy's statement.
[00:40:09.906 --> 00:40:11.748]  He said, I'm doing this because
[00:40:13.737 --> 00:40:17.040]  They gave me clemency, but it has nothing to do with Netanyahu.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:25.206]  But you have to actually go find his statement from his lawyer and his statement, because if you read the news, you won't see that.
[00:40:26.187 --> 00:40:32.613]  Unless you look at Jerusalem Online, Ari Haro says he's not trying to put the blame on Netanyahu.
[00:40:34.934 --> 00:40:41.440]  And they say somebody might have given Netanyahu's wife a present ten years ago, or
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.442]  I mean, it is the most ridiculous stuff you've ever heard of.
[00:40:47.502 --> 00:41:04.591]  You've got the Clintons and Obama and the Clinton Foundation, all these groups just engaged in, you know, 12 million here, 8 million there, 9 million here, 2 million there, from foreign governments to openly change policy within 24 hours.
[00:41:07.475 --> 00:41:08.536]  Of Hillary getting the money.
[00:41:09.296 --> 00:41:10.437]  And it's even in the WikiLeaks!
[00:41:11.038 --> 00:41:14.921]  Okay, you gave three million dollars, we'll get that meeting for you next week with Hillary.
[00:41:17.102 --> 00:41:18.824]  To change those regulations for you.
[00:41:19.664 --> 00:41:20.865]  Oh, there's an arms embargo?
[00:41:20.905 --> 00:41:24.508]  Don't worry, the State Department will give you a special license to get around that.
[00:41:24.688 --> 00:41:26.149]  I mean, it's crazy!
[00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:28.631]  It's so cut and dry.
[00:41:28.711 --> 00:41:30.633]  It's what they call open and shut.
[00:41:32.332 --> 00:41:36.215]  It'd be like if you committed a crime at the Super Bowl on the main stage.
[00:41:36.736 --> 00:41:44.902]  If you committed a murder on the Jumbotron in front of 90 million viewers, you pull a gun out, you shoot somebody, it's you, open and shut, done.
[00:41:46.243 --> 00:41:47.884]  It's the same thing with the Clintons.
[00:41:48.445 --> 00:41:51.487]  Then meanwhile, it's the same thing with this whole Netanyahu thing.
[00:41:51.808 --> 00:41:52.908]  There's nothing there.
[00:41:52.928 --> 00:41:55.951]  I don't have a dog in the fight for Netanyahu.
[00:41:56.191 --> 00:41:56.972]  I just go look at the facts.
[00:41:58.444 --> 00:41:59.625]  And there's nothing there!
[00:42:00.385 --> 00:42:03.587]  And they're saying, oh, he'll, you know, he's going to be indicted any minute.
[00:42:03.707 --> 00:42:20.437]  But, because he's the Prime Minister, they have similar parliamentary systems that we have, so one branch doesn't overthrow the other, that he won't even have to step down because of the fact that it's a separate branch of government, but that he won't survive the shame of it.
[00:42:22.619 --> 00:42:23.740]  And it's the same thing with Trump.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:39.269]  That's all they're doing is saying, his base has deserted him, no one supports him, he's down in the polls, you're a loser if you support him, the economy's bad, he doesn't have his base anymore, go back to sleep, on and on and on.
[00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.251]  And then you actually look at what Trump's doing.
[00:42:48.598 --> 00:42:57.304]  Turning the economy on, making companies do bids, fixing the VA, controlling the border, just all basic life support you do for a country.
[00:42:57.944 --> 00:43:04.529]  All he's doing is the default settings we had until the early 60s that made us prosperous.
[00:43:04.809 --> 00:43:06.530]  Just default stuff.
[00:43:09.472 --> 00:43:17.578]  But the mainstream media is running the hoax everywhere that Trump's base is deserting him and they put out more fake polls.
[00:43:20.165 --> 00:43:22.887]  And they take everything he does and try to make it look horrible.
[00:43:22.907 --> 00:43:24.308]  And why do I back Trump so hard?
[00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:38.077]  Because did you think it'd be easy to take Washington back and to cut taxes and repeal Obamacare and to get out of TPP and to kick the IMF and World Bank out of our government and to get out of the carbon taxes that only the West had to pay?
[00:43:38.437 --> 00:43:39.358]  You think it would be easy?
[00:43:39.458 --> 00:43:40.339]  It's going to be hard.
[00:43:40.399 --> 00:43:41.359]  They're going to fight back.
[00:43:41.439 --> 00:43:46.563]  And I can't believe how much he's gotten done in six months and three weeks.
[00:43:48.712 --> 00:44:02.041]  I can't believe how we've gone from hell to heaven, comparatively, and that I can't believe how instant gratification has diseased this nation, even some conservatives I know who never really backed Trump.
[00:44:03.666 --> 00:44:09.867]  But held their nose, they're kind of like, well, yeah, he's a little out of control and needs to stop tweeting and needs to get disciplined.
[00:44:09.887 --> 00:44:13.588]  And they buy into this thing like they're his mommy and they're his daddy.
[00:44:13.648 --> 00:44:16.749]  And yeah, we don't like Hillary, but she's gone now.
[00:44:16.869 --> 00:44:25.810]  So we just want to feel authoritative and feel powerful and feel like, you know, we're up here, critical of Trump, kind of hedging our bets.
[00:44:27.371 --> 00:44:29.131]  Just hedging your bets intellectually.
[00:44:30.131 --> 00:44:33.794]  Let me explain something to you and the Blue Blood Republicans and all the rest of them.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.985]  The globalists know there has been a total revolutionary awakening to their program.
[00:44:48.767 --> 00:44:52.891]  And they know that the people of the world are awake to them and upset about what they're doing.
[00:44:53.877 --> 00:45:05.964]  And they know now they can't act like we're still in a free society and leave those systems open or they're going to completely be economically, culturally, you name it, overthrown peacefully.
[00:45:06.324 --> 00:45:11.027]  So they've got to start a fight, start a civil emergency, start a group of crises.
[00:45:11.427 --> 00:45:17.991]  They've got to accelerate societal breakdown and then bring in authoritarian control as a supposed answer to that.
[00:45:19.451 --> 00:45:20.411]  And it's in their white papers.
[00:45:20.812 --> 00:45:26.074]  Bring in radical Islam, bring in 80% military age men, bring in 10 million of them into Europe alone.
[00:45:26.714 --> 00:45:28.355]  Keep the numbers secret until it's too late.
[00:45:28.695 --> 00:45:29.656]  Now they admit 10 million.
[00:45:29.676 --> 00:45:31.717]  I thought it was 5 million.
[00:45:31.737 --> 00:45:32.937]  10 million in the last 5 years.
[00:45:33.377 --> 00:45:38.820]  And then tell everybody, you don't have free speech anymore, you've got to comply and comport with Islam.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.845]  They're banning synagogues, new ones being built, churches being built in some areas of Europe, Australia.
[00:45:45.486 --> 00:45:50.591]  They're banning pork being served in at least seven European countries in their school lunch programs.
[00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:52.533]  Because it, quote, upsets the Muslims.
[00:45:54.635 --> 00:45:56.057]  The sky is the limit.
[00:45:56.077 --> 00:46:01.222]  They're just using an outside Stone Age authoritarian cult.
[00:46:06.072 --> 00:46:12.659]  To make everyone then comport with that, because if you'll comport with that, if you'll put up with that, you'll put up with anything.
[00:46:12.799 --> 00:46:14.381]  What do you think the tranny stuff's about?
[00:46:15.546 --> 00:46:18.007]  First, it's, oh, be nice to gay people in the military.
[00:46:18.387 --> 00:46:19.407]  Don't be mean to them.
[00:46:19.687 --> 00:46:20.528]  Sounds reasonable.
[00:46:21.008 --> 00:46:21.708]  Now, boom!
[00:46:21.808 --> 00:46:22.408]  It's trannies!
[00:46:22.908 --> 00:46:34.132]  And let's teach sex changes, and give it to anybody you want in the military, and turn it into a giant factory of confusion that will sabotage human operations of the military, ahead of the robots replacing everybody, which is all admitted.
[00:46:34.492 --> 00:46:39.754]  And then when you accept the trannies and the sex changes, well, you'll accept the brain chips and everything else, which they're now admitting.
[00:46:40.234 --> 00:46:43.475]  They simply set a new goalpost that sounds incredibly radical,
[00:46:44.275 --> 00:47:02.588]  So that you'll accept everything else they were already pushing behind that, and then they can persecute the military and persecute one of the only human cultures left, the male culture of war and defense, and so they can go in and social engineer and take control of that!
[00:47:03.777 --> 00:47:15.024]  While they steal from the public all of our basic rights, they give you the right to be transmutagenic, to end your humanity, because that's the biological revolution.
[00:47:16.265 --> 00:47:19.447]  That ties together with this report I have here.
[00:47:19.527 --> 00:47:22.008]  Fido and Fluffy are ruining the environment.
[00:47:22.189 --> 00:47:29.073]  UCLA study says, they say, euthanize your pet, euthanize your dog, euthanize your kitty.
[00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:30.534]  Well, why is that?
[00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:35.462]  Peter Singer is the spiritual and cultural leader of PETA.
[00:47:37.045 --> 00:47:39.510]  PETA is admittedly a transhumanist cult.
[00:47:40.438 --> 00:47:58.242]  That wants to speak for animal rights so they can leverage out the voting rights of human as a lobby and speak for the animals but they don't actually care for the animals and in their teaching they want domesticated animals to be illegal from parrots to dogs to cats and want to make you euthanize them.
[00:47:58.302 --> 00:48:06.924]  Now that's only done so that you will then accept when the government says we're going to tax you like communist China does for having a dog or a cat.
[00:48:08.712 --> 00:48:10.012]  Because you owe an allegiance to it.
[00:48:10.433 --> 00:48:18.595]  It gives you some normal humanity, even though it's an animal, it psychologically, it culturally, it spiritually raises your consciousness.
[00:48:18.615 --> 00:48:36.402]  They've got computer graphs that show this from the television, from everything, because the animals haven't been completely programmed yet, though Google and Samsung and others are trying to through the TVs, so that it's actually buoying you to even be around a dog or a cat and helping trigger your own humanity.
[00:48:37.242 --> 00:48:48.873]  Just like they want you out of the forest, out of the hills, out of the water, out of the fields, away from the horses, just to even have animals in your house, birds tweeting, sun shining, you're not looking at a TV.
[00:48:49.053 --> 00:48:50.134]  This is all declassified.
[00:48:50.575 --> 00:48:53.097]  Ugly architecture, ugly literature, all declassified.
[00:48:53.417 --> 00:49:01.185]  They funded PETA and other groups so that they can then make it guiltful and bad to even have a dog or a cat.
[00:49:03.752 --> 00:49:11.458]  So you'll then pay a carbon tax, and they say, oh, your dog has a big carbon footprint, and your cat, so we need you to go ahead and kill him.
[00:49:12.599 --> 00:49:14.320]  David Knight shot a big report on it.
[00:49:14.981 --> 00:49:16.442]  I tweeted it out at Real Alex Jones.
[00:49:16.842 --> 00:49:19.664]  California crazies, kill your pet, not just your car.
[00:49:20.105 --> 00:49:22.186]  An interesting headline, but none of this is crazy.
[00:49:23.027 --> 00:49:26.590]  This is all done 100% by design.
[00:49:29.032 --> 00:49:30.053]  This is all done 100%
[00:49:32.867 --> 00:49:48.417]  In their own words, to absolutely dehumanize you and remove you from any environment that has any vestigial, cultural, ancestral memory basis.
[00:49:49.478 --> 00:49:56.282]  It is a full assault, not just on you, but on every plant, every animal, every ecosystem.
[00:49:56.522 --> 00:49:58.163]  Everything's being overwritten.
[00:49:58.584 --> 00:50:00.445]  Everything's being destroyed by design.
[00:50:01.894 --> 00:50:19.099]  And then the people that are doing it claim they represent the environmental movement and are going to tax carbon dioxide because they know you know sunlight's good, they know you know oxygen's good, they know you know water's good, but the fourth element of the carbon cycle is carbon dioxide.
[00:50:19.359 --> 00:50:23.080]  You cannot have life on this planet, third rock out, without it.
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:33.443]  So they're just beginning to say, we need you to eat less meat.
[00:50:33.763 --> 00:50:36.185]  We need you to have lower carbon footprint.
[00:50:36.945 --> 00:50:47.192]  But if you go to PETA, who's been caught doing it, they go to the S... If they go to the pound and get dogs and cats and then euthanize them, I was the first to break that 16 years ago.
[00:50:47.832 --> 00:50:49.353]  They go, then they got caught, remember?
[00:50:50.193 --> 00:50:51.934]  Throwing hundreds of dead animals into a dumpster.
[00:50:51.974 --> 00:50:56.137]  They go and have their members get them and then they themselves kill them.
[00:50:59.127 --> 00:51:00.527]  And people ask, well, why do they do it?
[00:51:00.547 --> 00:51:01.788]  Because it's just a sick cult.
[00:51:05.129 --> 00:51:07.250]  Behind closed doors, it's completely insane.
[00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:09.310]  Hamburgers, steak dinners, you name it.
[00:51:09.691 --> 00:51:11.031]  It's all a sick joke.
[00:51:11.071 --> 00:51:23.475]  But you have to understand, it's all compartmentalized mental illness by design to teach you to accept total authoritarianism.
[00:51:23.495 --> 00:51:28.477]  I mean, imagine just five years ago, hey, we're going to make the military have trannies
[00:51:31.138 --> 00:51:33.760]  And then we're going to make the military pay for sex changes.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:34.601]  You'd say that's crazy.
[00:51:35.061 --> 00:51:36.942]  Now it's just, oh, it's given.
[00:51:37.102 --> 00:51:38.323]  You're not hateful, are you?
[00:51:39.044 --> 00:51:47.890]  And then it's given that at colleges and high schools, they're saying, oh, we're going to let men and women self-identify and compete on each other's teams.
[00:51:49.491 --> 00:51:52.493]  And so now in the Olympics this year,
[00:51:53.402 --> 00:52:00.869]  They announced as policy what had already been unofficial policy for the last three Summer and Winter Olympics.
[00:52:00.949 --> 00:52:03.792]  And that is that men can now compete.
[00:52:03.812 --> 00:52:06.455]  Of course, there's none vice versa.
[00:52:06.475 --> 00:52:07.956]  You don't see women competing with the men.
[00:52:08.176 --> 00:52:08.937]  It's about winning.
[00:52:09.298 --> 00:52:10.679]  It's about winning the gold medal.
[00:52:10.719 --> 00:52:12.701]  It's about people that are neurotic and want to cheat.
[00:52:13.361 --> 00:52:15.604]  And it's about men on average who are twice as strong.
[00:52:17.952 --> 00:52:24.055]  Men on average who are much, much quicker and faster, just genetically, like in any mammal species, the males are bigger.
[00:52:24.636 --> 00:52:26.317]  In some other species, the females are bigger.
[00:52:26.957 --> 00:52:32.640]  But in most bird species, the male is bigger and goes out and, you know, gets the food and brings it back and stuff.
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:37.383]  Because, you know, the female has the eggs, sits on them.
[00:52:37.443 --> 00:52:40.465]  In general species, females take care of the babies.
[00:52:41.769 --> 00:52:42.930]  The males go out, get the food.
[00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:44.151]  The males go out and get killed.
[00:52:44.171 --> 00:52:45.312]  The males go out and go to war.
[00:52:45.732 --> 00:52:47.574]  It's the same thing in chimpanzees, you name it.
[00:52:48.094 --> 00:52:58.323]  They're literally turning all that on its head and then acting like I'm weird when I look at a Daily Mail article with a headline, Man Gives Birth.
[00:52:58.423 --> 00:52:59.704]  First Man Gives Birth.
[00:53:00.565 --> 00:53:06.910]  And you look at it, it's a woman with a uterus and a vagina and they have a baby.
[00:53:09.301 --> 00:53:13.904]  It's all just mental illness by design to confuse culture and confuse your kids.
[00:53:14.284 --> 00:53:15.565]  Remember, it's totally cold-blooded.
[00:53:15.645 --> 00:53:19.628]  It's not even mental illness from the people at the top.
[00:53:20.128 --> 00:53:23.070]  They all know full well 100,000 times what they're doing.
[00:53:26.189 --> 00:53:26.749]  Don't believe me?
[00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:30.271]  Type in CIA planned transgender movement.
[00:53:30.331 --> 00:53:31.212]  Type into search engines.
[00:53:31.232 --> 00:53:31.972]  You'll get mainstream news.
[00:53:32.552 --> 00:53:36.074]  CIA planned to push homosexuality to reduce population in family.
[00:53:36.415 --> 00:53:36.935]  Just Google.
[00:53:36.975 --> 00:53:41.437]  CIA had planned to have ugly squat architecture to crush human spirit.
[00:53:42.858 --> 00:53:46.600]  When you hear CIA, that just means the big foundations behind the CIA.
[00:53:48.001 --> 00:53:49.982]  Every single bit of it.
[00:53:51.621 --> 00:54:15.594]  Is about a war on reality, a war on common sense, a war on you to make you guilty for everything you do, where you can't have or do anything, where you feel so guilty as Obama and Hillary and Al Gore lecture you when one of Al Gore's houses has 33 times the carbon footprint of the average person, as if carbon's even bad.
[00:54:17.135 --> 00:54:20.357]  The toxic waste dumping, the genetic engineering, the nanotech,
[00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:23.071]  The pharmacological crops.
[00:54:23.411 --> 00:54:23.791]  All of it.
[00:54:23.931 --> 00:54:25.112]  Oh, that's not a problem.
[00:54:26.273 --> 00:54:27.274]  The geoengineering.
[00:54:27.674 --> 00:54:28.634]  That's not a problem.
[00:54:29.675 --> 00:54:30.455]  The AI.
[00:54:32.277 --> 00:54:33.617]  The destruction of free will.
[00:54:34.618 --> 00:54:35.499]  None of that's an issue.
[00:54:35.539 --> 00:54:36.920]  No, no, it's carbon!
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.001]  Carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[00:54:41.322 --> 00:54:42.263]  And then it's Enron.
[00:54:42.543 --> 00:54:46.285]  And Dutch Rochelle and BP are the main funders of the carbon tax for 30 years.
[00:54:47.588 --> 00:54:54.951]  But you get the environmentalist cult members saying, oh, you're funded by the oil companies because you're saying this is a scam.
[00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:55.231]  No, no.
[00:54:55.271 --> 00:54:57.111]  The oil companies created it.
[00:55:00.813 --> 00:55:01.213]  I'm sorry.
[00:55:01.233 --> 00:55:02.153]  I said 33 times.
[00:55:02.233 --> 00:55:05.374]  It's 34 times Al Gore's carbon footprint of one home.
[00:55:05.414 --> 00:55:05.794]  Excuse me.
[00:55:05.834 --> 00:55:06.214]  I'm sorry.
[00:55:07.195 --> 00:55:08.555]  But again, you can't have a car.
[00:55:08.635 --> 00:55:09.816]  You can't have air conditioning.
[00:55:09.976 --> 00:55:10.556]  They can't.
[00:55:11.641 --> 00:55:19.226]  It's the elites teaching you to be guilty from birth that they've got everything and you've got nothing and that it's cute and fun to be a loser.
[00:55:21.508 --> 00:55:30.554]  Now coming up the next hour, we've got compilations I haven't gotten to yet with
[00:55:32.915 --> 00:55:40.560]  Folks that have been inside the Trump White House that have been fired by McMaster for pointing out the left's alliance with orthodox radical Islam.
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:41.640]  Rich Higgins and others.
[00:55:43.081 --> 00:55:53.467]  We're also going to have several guests joining us with breaking news from inside the White House and where this war to take down the President and kill our movement to restore the Republic is going.
[00:55:54.708 --> 00:55:55.509]  And so much more.
[00:55:55.629 --> 00:55:57.330]  So that is in the
[00:55:59.171 --> 00:55:59.771]  Second hour.
[00:55:59.851 --> 00:56:04.954]  Also, I saw this a few weeks ago and I knew where it was going and I meant to get on air and cover it and predict it.
[00:56:06.194 --> 00:56:09.276]  Trump doesn't want to pay three times what the Boeing aircraft are worth.
[00:56:09.296 --> 00:56:12.297]  Or, you know, what they're supposedly worth.
[00:56:13.778 --> 00:56:20.341]  And so he told the Air Force, refit some of our old aircraft, repair the ones, they got several Air Force Ones, repair these.
[00:56:21.479 --> 00:56:30.002]  The Air Force came up with a bankrupt Russian airline that bought two aircraft from Boeing but never flew them, that are just waiting to be received back to the U.S.
[00:56:30.463 --> 00:56:33.264]  And so now the Air Force says, sir, let's retrofit these.
[00:56:33.704 --> 00:56:35.325]  This will cost, you know, a tenth of the price.
[00:56:35.945 --> 00:56:38.766]  And they're now spinning it that he's buying aircraft from Russia.
[00:56:39.186 --> 00:56:40.407]  He has nothing to even do with it.
[00:56:40.607 --> 00:56:43.588]  He said, we're not going to, this isn't going to happen while he's president.
[00:56:43.908 --> 00:56:45.589]  They're talking about, you know, years from now.
[00:56:46.565 --> 00:56:47.846]  Having to retire Air Force One.
[00:56:48.106 --> 00:56:50.327]  He's just saving money everywhere, giving back his paycheck.
[00:56:50.687 --> 00:56:53.708]  They spend that into he's a Russian.
[00:56:55.949 --> 00:56:58.110]  Now again, all of this is economic warfare.
[00:56:58.130 --> 00:57:01.011]  They're doing everything they can to shut us down and to cut off our funding.
[00:57:01.051 --> 00:57:02.772]  If you simply go to Infowarsstore.com
[00:57:04.571 --> 00:57:11.495]  And you simply take advantage of this month's special, the 1776 Specials, where I've got many items that are $30, $40 at 1776.
[00:57:11.955 --> 00:57:20.920]  It'll help fund our operation and get great products you need, like BrainForce, our amazing brain pill, Nootropic, with a lot of known compounds to boost healthy brain function and better operation.
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:21.401]  It's incredible.
[00:57:21.421 --> 00:57:22.942]  People love it.
[00:57:22.962 --> 00:57:23.142]  55% off.
[00:57:23.182 --> 00:57:25.603]  Survival Shields X2, the good halogen, $17.76, 55% off.

[00:59:16.619 --> 00:59:20.801]  No wonder the Versa is the most popular model in America.

[00:59:55.903 --> 01:00:01.810]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:16.501]  For every question they don't want you to ask, he has the answer they don't want you to hear.
[01:00:17.061 --> 01:00:19.784]  He is Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.085 --> 01:00:27.830]  Under my thumb, the girl who once had me down.
[01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:35.437]  Under my thumb, the girl who once pushed me around.
[01:00:37.918 --> 01:00:40.321]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:00:41.562 --> 01:00:42.043]  to 3 p.m.
[01:00:42.063 --> 01:00:42.744]  we're here live.
[01:00:42.824 --> 01:00:45.266]  Jack Posobiec's got big breaking news from inside the White House.
[01:00:45.747 --> 01:00:47.129]  He's guiding us to cover the waterfront.
[01:00:47.229 --> 01:00:48.370]  We'll also put the phones up.
[01:00:49.671 --> 01:00:52.415]  I haven't even gotten into the great job Sean Hannity is doing.
[01:00:52.475 --> 01:00:54.016]  I'm gonna play that coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:54.036 --> 01:00:55.919]  The article's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.021]  Sean Hannity's saying
[01:00:59.153 --> 01:01:17.183]  If he finds he's been unmasked, because thousands of people that were involved with the Trump campaign are supporting the Make America Great Again operation, were surveilled by the NSA, that's come out in leaked documents about yours truly, Michael Savage, he's saying that he is going to have the mother of all lawsuits if that is indeed the case.
[01:01:18.603 --> 01:01:19.564]  Well, that is the case.
[01:01:22.022 --> 01:01:26.605]  And we've got the liberal anti-Trump media goes all in for in battle General McMaster.
[01:01:26.625 --> 01:01:28.045]  That's another Breitbart story.
[01:01:28.526 --> 01:01:32.568]  We saw the Young Turks funded by Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:33.368 --> 01:01:34.489]  We've seen CNN.
[01:01:34.529 --> 01:01:35.910]  We've seen MSNBC.
[01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:39.772]  We've seen all of them defending their little darling McMaster.
[01:01:41.113 --> 01:01:44.134]  When Trump tried to get four different people to take the job, none of them wanted it.
[01:01:45.175 --> 01:01:47.176]  Because they knew if they were patriots, they'd be targeted.
[01:01:48.216 --> 01:01:49.217]  So they all dodged it.
[01:01:49.897 --> 01:01:50.718]  Flynn didn't dodge it.
[01:01:52.671 --> 01:01:55.012]  Now they're trying to get him criminally with a bunch of made-up garbage.
[01:01:56.052 --> 01:01:58.793]  See Flynn wasn't involved in a dereliction of duty.
[01:01:59.314 --> 01:02:02.095]  And they slipped in McMaster, who it turns out is a big globalist.
[01:02:02.995 --> 01:02:06.696]  We've got so much coming up this hour with Jack Posovic who's going to ride shotgun with us.
[01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:10.358]  We're going to look at some of the people they've been removing from the National Security Council.
[01:02:10.878 --> 01:02:13.439]  And it tells you everything you need to know.
[01:02:13.499 --> 01:02:18.761]  But Rich Higgins describes the information warfare the Muslim Brotherhood is engaging in with the left.
[01:02:19.841 --> 01:02:22.385]  Rich Higgins talks about the real threat of violent extremism.
[01:02:23.666 --> 01:02:25.228]  This is the guy that got fired last week.
[01:02:25.268 --> 01:02:28.953]  He gives strategic advice to the new administration.
[01:02:31.136 --> 01:02:34.461]  We have California crazies who aren't so crazy.
[01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:35.763]  They want to tax you and control you.
[01:02:37.432 --> 01:02:40.235]  But they have their radicals say, kill your pet, you should be able to have a pet.
[01:02:40.696 --> 01:02:45.201]  It makes it sound less radical and they say, no, we're just going to tax you for having a pet because of the evil.
[01:02:45.221 --> 01:02:48.865]  They're already taxing cows in Canada and places, you know, for their flatulence.
[01:02:48.885 --> 01:02:50.907]  So why not tax there?
[01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:54.611]  And then we also have the Democrats want martial law.
[01:02:54.651 --> 01:02:55.412]  Very important report.
[01:02:55.432 --> 01:02:56.614]  We're going to get to all this today.
[01:02:58.164 --> 01:03:04.073]  We have the Democrat Senator Blumenthal who says the Justice Department is weaponizing leak laws for its personal and political ends.
[01:03:04.113 --> 01:03:11.223]  Yeah, they're doing illegal leaking and they're saying they're not going to arrest journalists like Obama did at a level never foreseen in U.S.
[01:03:11.243 --> 01:03:11.544]  history.
[01:03:17.895 --> 01:03:24.219]  But then the media is demonizing the fact that if you're in the White House leaking classified stuff, that is a felony.
[01:03:24.239 --> 01:03:25.040]  We're going to go after you.
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:26.841]  They're going, oh, this is so tyrannical.
[01:03:27.341 --> 01:03:29.262]  Again, they invert everything.
[01:03:29.302 --> 01:03:30.463]  And I know you know that.
[01:03:30.543 --> 01:03:34.866]  But the big hoax is that the president's numbers are down.
[01:03:34.906 --> 01:03:37.768]  The big hoax is that he's not doing well in the polls.
[01:03:39.505 --> 01:03:44.832]  And he's come out in speeches and in tweets and said, just like during the campaign, they told you I was unpopular when I wasn't.
[01:03:45.213 --> 01:03:54.045]  Our base is as big and successful as ever because we're delivering on the economy, delivering on the borders, delivering crushing political correctness, and we're all coming together.
[01:03:54.065 --> 01:03:56.027]  We've never been stronger because that's the truth.
[01:03:57.810 --> 01:03:59.270]  Gotta get the economy going again.
[01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:00.010]  We're trying.
[01:04:00.351 --> 01:04:01.491]  It's starting to get purchased.
[01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:02.751]  It's starting to get a toehold.
[01:04:02.811 --> 01:04:03.771]  It's starting to roar back.
[01:04:04.051 --> 01:04:06.092]  The elite are panicking and admittedly trying to kill it.
[01:04:06.552 --> 01:04:07.932]  Gotta expose the fake polls.
[01:04:08.292 --> 01:04:18.114]  Gotta expose how they're trying to legitimize, in deep state, the overthrow of the president, outside of government.
[01:04:19.515 --> 01:04:25.556]  You've got former Reagan officials saying Trump could be gone very soon, that the swamp is preparing to try to destroy him.
[01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:34.744]  Another big study out, letting illegals stay costs six times more than deporting them.
[01:04:36.225 --> 01:04:44.330]  There's this whole thing, and if you talk about illegals, especially that have committed crimes, being deported, you're somehow a meanie, when all these other countries deport you as well.
[01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:55.337]  It's just, it's like America has just been gilted into the most crazy mindsets of self-hate the world's ever seen, and regardless of what they do to Trump, we have won.
[01:04:57.472 --> 01:05:00.093]  By the fact that we've gotten so much done against the globalists.
[01:05:04.375 --> 01:05:07.916]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:05:08.376 --> 01:05:14.419]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:05:14.819 --> 01:05:17.620]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.021]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:05:21.202 --> 01:05:24.643]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:05:24.983 --> 01:05:26.724]  The left controls culture.
[01:05:26.764 --> 01:05:27.725]  They control arts.
[01:05:27.805 --> 01:05:29.026]  They control entertainment.
[01:05:29.326 --> 01:05:36.412]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:05:36.472 --> 01:05:38.874]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:05:39.354 --> 01:05:43.217]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:05:43.277 --> 01:05:45.339]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[01:05:45.959 --> 01:05:51.323]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[01:05:51.583 --> 01:05:57.848]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:05:57.908 --> 01:05:59.610]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:00.951]  It's available right now.
[01:06:01.271 --> 01:06:03.433]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:04.173 --> 01:06:08.755]  We have private labeled it, and it is the exact same product, just the name is different.

[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:22.760]  Hygiene.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:24.300]  Not getting skin cancer.
[01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:27.261]  Not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and mosquitoes.
[01:06:27.762 --> 01:06:28.702]  It's all there.
[01:06:29.022 --> 01:06:33.664]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[01:06:33.844 --> 01:06:41.187]  Of the 30-plus proprietary products that we've developed for Infowarslife.com, DNA Force is the flagship.
[01:06:41.567 --> 01:06:50.130]  This highly advanced formula has been sold out for close to six months due to a worldwide shortage of the sought-after ingredients.
[01:06:50.490 --> 01:07:07.696]  Today I'm very excited to announce that we have received a limited shipment of DNA Force and despite the fact that we have been sold out for close to six months, I'm still discounting it 20% because I want listeners and viewers that haven't tried DNA Force yet to actually get a chance to see how amazing it is.

[01:07:28.206 --> 01:07:31.888]  And again, thank you for making the InfoWar possible.
[01:07:32.288 --> 01:07:33.648]  You are the InfoWar.
[01:07:36.977 --> 01:07:39.860]  Accept the truth and buck the system and the group collective.
[01:07:40.941 --> 01:07:46.205]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[01:07:46.225 --> 01:07:47.186]  This is the Info War.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:10.502]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:14.603 --> 01:08:19.765]  Now we've learned that the former Obama National Security, Ben Rhodes, is a person of interest.
[01:08:19.825 --> 01:08:20.045]  What?
[01:08:21.201 --> 01:08:22.742]  The House Intelligence Committee.
[01:08:23.522 --> 01:08:27.444]  Plus, Congress is now questioning other Obama officials.
[01:08:27.844 --> 01:08:28.805]  Susan Rice.
[01:08:29.445 --> 01:08:30.045]  Brennan.
[01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:39.070]  You know, Clapper literally set the stage for this by lessening the rules of unmasking from a very few to many.
[01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:53.934]  And then Obama changed the rules in 2011, and then, of course, 12-333, just two weeks before he leaves office, where intelligence now could be shared with so many more agencies than ever before, which he never wanted to live under.
[01:08:54.814 --> 01:08:56.335]  This is what I've been telling you about.
[01:08:56.695 --> 01:08:58.395]  This is what I work on day and night.
[01:08:58.415 --> 01:08:59.856]  This is what keeps me up at night.
[01:09:01.047 --> 01:09:04.310]  And Congress is questioning these Obama officials, finally.
[01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:05.971]  And then Sarah Carter.
[01:09:06.111 --> 01:09:08.554]  And then on top of that, the special counsel of the FBI!
[01:09:09.334 --> 01:09:10.795]  And James Comey himself!
[01:09:11.892 --> 01:09:19.500]  Now, and then John Solomon reporting that the former Director of National Intelligence Clapper, by the way, he got a CNN gig and James Comey gets a book deal.
[01:09:20.141 --> 01:09:26.288]  But Clapper made it easier for officials in the executive branch to unmask members of Congress and their staffers.
[01:09:26.808 --> 01:09:31.673]  And I have it on pretty good authority that I've been unmasked, among other things.
[01:09:32.114 --> 01:09:33.576]  And by the way, if I find out
[01:09:34.867 --> 01:09:49.519]  I am going to sanction the biggest lawsuit that I possibly can with the biggest attorneys in this country so we can do something to stop the shredding of our Constitution.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.343]  I will do that because that is illegal!
[01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:58.707]  And if my rights are violated, we will find a way to make this happen.
[01:09:59.708 --> 01:10:02.650]  Anyway, it's not happening in a bubble here.
[01:10:03.444 --> 01:10:09.707]  Look at all their... Hillary Clinton, deleting, subpoenaed emails, bleach pit, hammering devices.
[01:10:10.167 --> 01:10:12.348]  Where's the special counsel for that?
[01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:18.211]  Where's the special counsel for 20% of uranium going to Russia and Putin?
[01:10:18.911 --> 01:10:26.254]  You know, really, at 145 million kickback and so much other evidence of kickbacks, look at what Judicial Watch found out this week.
[01:10:26.274 --> 01:10:34.877]  Where's the special counsel for a DNC paid operative meeting at the Ukrainian embassy with the Ukrainian ambassador?
[01:10:35.137 --> 01:10:40.299]  The Ukrainians leaking bad information and disseminating false information on Donald Trump.
[01:10:41.719 --> 01:10:45.541]  Very powerful to see Sean Hannity telling it like it is, and Sean Hannity
[01:10:46.795 --> 01:10:50.216]  Is one of the few shows that President Trump still watches.
[01:10:50.536 --> 01:10:51.916]  They have him totally isolated.
[01:10:52.756 --> 01:10:54.176]  That's been their plan all along.
[01:10:57.577 --> 01:11:02.758]  And you've got the Republicans raising seven times what they previously were this time a few years ago.
[01:11:03.358 --> 01:11:07.859]  You've got all these state houses going Republican, all these governors flipping Republican.
[01:11:09.519 --> 01:11:10.399]  Huge victories.
[01:11:10.819 --> 01:11:13.080]  The Democratic Party is being turned into a
[01:11:16.249 --> 01:11:42.444]  has been kook organization but they don't care because they're the establishment the top republicans were put in there you got this ex-reagan official saying that the republican leadership that the old man on the hill uses terms like that the wise men the never trumpers the neocons are preparing to remove him outside
[01:11:43.692 --> 01:11:44.372]  of impeachment.
[01:11:45.113 --> 01:11:47.694]  Stockman, who was director of the Office of Management and Budget.
[01:11:48.634 --> 01:12:01.319]  Ultimately, the hammer of fiscal crisis and crashing stock market, which they're trying to engage in, will break any remaining loyalty of the GOP elders as they smell the 2018 elections turning into a replay of the rout of 1974.
[01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.441]  And then, Donald will be gone.
[01:12:06.402 --> 01:12:11.904]  And well before 2018, too, I told an audience in Vancouver last Friday, and it could happen,
[01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:24.763]  Well, this isn't Richard Nixon they're fighting with.
[01:12:24.823 --> 01:12:25.564]  It's Donald Trump.
[01:12:25.964 --> 01:12:26.645]  It's the Internet.
[01:12:26.685 --> 01:12:27.685]  It's the 21st century.
[01:12:28.266 --> 01:12:37.612]  Now, it's true that Peter Thiel is in an article today that's posted up on InfoWars.com and DrugsReport.com.
[01:12:40.063 --> 01:12:44.287]  Now, it's from the fake news site BuzzFeed, so, I mean, who knows if it's true.
[01:12:44.587 --> 01:12:50.372]  I've had BuzzFeed write articles about me that literally have almost no truth in them.
[01:12:52.174 --> 01:12:57.599]  I mean, there'll be something in there like, Alex Jones was at the courthouse for a custody battle with his ex-wife.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.661]  But that'd be the only part that was true.
[01:13:03.237 --> 01:13:07.367]  Only BuzzFeed and Daily Beast could be more fake than CNN.
[01:13:07.408 --> 01:13:09.813]  I mean, it is the standard of it.
[01:13:10.114 --> 01:13:12.219]  You know, PPGate, all of it came from them.
[01:13:14.073 --> 01:13:17.294]  Peter Thiel has been hedging his bet on Donald Trump.
[01:13:17.954 --> 01:13:24.196]  And he goes on to say that he's been telling people Trump's off to a great start, but behind the scenes thinks it's 50-50 he'll be removed.
[01:13:24.577 --> 01:13:25.777]  Well, I think it's more than 50-50.
[01:13:25.857 --> 01:13:30.919]  I think right now they're planning to blow Trump's head off or drug him and say he had a mental collapse.
[01:13:31.399 --> 01:13:34.740]  I mean, they're on television saying they're getting ready for that.
[01:13:36.461 --> 01:13:39.482]  And then separately, when I and others talk about it, they go, oh, you're crazy.
[01:13:40.339 --> 01:13:46.401]  They had Newsweek and a bunch of other fake news publications over the weekend say, look, Jones is crazy.
[01:13:47.181 --> 01:13:48.962]  He says there's a plan to overthrow the president.
[01:13:50.262 --> 01:13:51.303]  He's completely insane.
[01:13:54.044 --> 01:14:00.206]  And they never quote where I'm playing clips and showing news articles where they're saying it, but in establishment publications.
[01:14:01.974 --> 01:14:04.595]  Then they say, oh, Jones has been changing his story.
[01:14:04.975 --> 01:14:06.676]  He said they were going to steal the nomination.
[01:14:06.716 --> 01:14:10.437]  Then he said that they were going to steal him being seated as the president.
[01:14:10.818 --> 01:14:13.459]  Then he said they would, yeah, they've been trying all along.
[01:14:13.519 --> 01:14:14.579]  We've been beating them.
[01:14:15.419 --> 01:14:17.680]  But they've been saying we're going to steal the nomination.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.541]  They've been saying they're going to have faithless electors.
[01:14:20.861 --> 01:14:24.563]  And then we stood up to them, unlike Bernie Sanders with Hillary.
[01:14:25.783 --> 01:14:26.964]  But they act like, oh, look.
[01:14:28.717 --> 01:14:29.737]  He's not accurate.
[01:14:30.198 --> 01:14:51.826]  When I'm totally on target, that's why they can't stand it, and have to engage in this alchemy, where they go, okay, this guy's got our whole agenda, he's following what we're actually doing, he's warning people about the plan, and now Hannity and Limbaugh and everybody else have picked it up, and now what are we going to do, because the public knows what we're doing, and they know our polls are fake, and they know that we're trying to break the base away from Trump.
[01:14:52.586 --> 01:15:07.713]  And they know that Fox News has even been turned against him, and they know that he's killed TPP, and the carbon tax, and secured the borders, and started the wall, and is trying to get the taxes cut, trying to kill Obamacare, and got a good bill through, but the Republicans killed it with John McCain, who broke his word.
[01:15:07.973 --> 01:15:09.014]  How do we turn that around?
[01:15:09.434 --> 01:15:12.355]  Obamacare, that's our fault, our big screwjob of them.
[01:15:12.836 --> 01:15:15.337]  Thank goodness they're so stupid, you know, Jonathan Gruber.
[01:15:16.516 --> 01:15:17.076]  How do we turn that?
[01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:18.057]  Well just say it's his.
[01:15:18.337 --> 01:15:18.998]  Say he failed.
[01:15:19.218 --> 01:15:20.278]  Say he got nothing done.
[01:15:20.559 --> 01:15:24.901]  Put him on the cover of Newsweek with a fake photo of him with Cheetos all over him.
[01:15:25.242 --> 01:15:28.964]  Sitting there watching TV and say he's a slob that never did anything.
[01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:29.845]  He's a failure.
[01:15:30.085 --> 01:15:31.065]  He didn't get elected.
[01:15:31.366 --> 01:15:32.526]  He never was successful.
[01:15:32.787 --> 01:15:33.907]  He never had children.
[01:15:34.207 --> 01:15:35.328]  He never had businesses.
[01:15:35.608 --> 01:15:37.349]  Donald Trump doesn't even exist.
[01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:42.233]  Just like they pretty much imply Seth Rich never existed.
[01:15:43.143 --> 01:15:47.446]  If you even talk about him shot in the back, they say, oh my gosh, incredible evil.
[01:15:48.246 --> 01:15:55.952]  Meanwhile, McMaster worked at Think Tank, backed by Soros-funded group that helped Obama sell Iran nuclear deal.
[01:15:57.473 --> 01:15:59.034]  Yeah, they've totally double-crossed us.
[01:15:59.614 --> 01:16:00.795]  I mean, when you realize that
[01:16:02.193 --> 01:16:16.324]  Once you go corrupt, once you're evil, once you decide to be evil, you automatically ally yourself with Islam, because they've got more liquid cash than anybody, they're allied with the globalists, and they've got a project to end the Western world.
[01:16:16.404 --> 01:16:23.910]  Clapper and all of them are horrible people, and then we find out people inside the National Security Council that discovered this are fired!
[01:16:25.472 --> 01:16:26.773]  We're going to play some of those
[01:16:28.519 --> 01:16:35.642]  Interviews and speeches that really have gotten no play or no attention coming up and riding shotgun with us with real-time analysis of Jack Posobiec.
[01:16:36.183 --> 01:16:38.144]  Jack Posobiec on Twitter.
[01:16:38.224 --> 01:16:40.845]  Jack Posobiec, citizensfortrump.com.
[01:16:42.591 --> 01:16:54.714]  I want to cover the waterfront with him, the latest intel, the fight to isolate Trump, the fake polls they're putting out, the fact that Trump's launching the new Trump Channel embryonic phase, a once-a-week boildown.
[01:16:54.734 --> 01:17:01.796]  Of course, CNN says it's fake news when he ran his own jobs numbers that the CBO admits are real.
[01:17:02.956 --> 01:17:09.918]  They blocked Drudge articles that Drudge tweeted from CNBC and AP on
[01:17:11.215 --> 01:17:17.857]  Eric Trump's Twitter Friday, we wrote a story about that, where they said, you're not allowed to share this, this is sensitive information.
[01:17:18.417 --> 01:17:24.099]  So now, they're just going to tell us, you can't see the jobs report, we're just going to tell you it's fake.
[01:17:24.719 --> 01:17:25.780]  And we're not going to let you see it.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.241]  Next level deception, Jack Posobiec.
[01:17:31.962 --> 01:17:33.402]  Hey, you're exactly right, Alex.
[01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:39.064]  And I don't know if you saw just recently, earlier today, Donald Trump tried to retweet somebody on Twitter.
[01:17:39.557 --> 01:17:42.198]  As soon as he retweeted it, Twitter suspended that account.
[01:17:42.818 --> 01:17:50.480]  So instead of actually censoring it like they did with the Eric Trump tweet, they went and suspended this guy's complete account so you can't even see what it was.
[01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:54.681]  There isn't even an archive of what the President Trump was trying to share to the American people.
[01:17:54.961 --> 01:17:56.721]  He simply is trying to get information out.
[01:17:56.961 --> 01:17:58.182]  Twitter goes and zaps it away.
[01:17:58.222 --> 01:18:00.062]  It's even worse than what they did with Eric Trump.
[01:18:00.373 --> 01:18:05.958]  Because at least with that we could go in and we could sort of de-program it so we could see what actually he was trying to say.
[01:18:05.999 --> 01:18:07.660]  This one, they zapped his account.
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:11.604]  So President Trump says he wants to hear from you and Twitter zaps it away immediately.
[01:18:11.824 --> 01:18:14.687]  And what he's got to do now is he's got a screenshot.
[01:18:15.288 --> 01:18:19.191]  He's got a screenshot everything he's going to tweet and say here is what I'm tweeting.
[01:18:19.472 --> 01:18:21.734]  So if they deep six it, it comes back against them.
[01:18:23.717 --> 01:18:41.824]  That's right, and it's only going to further and further normalize the idea that they can control what Donald Trump says, that they can control what information Donald Trump shares, and because what they're also attempting to do behind the scenes is isolate the President's intake of information and control what information is given to him.
[01:18:42.124 --> 01:18:45.665]  They'll share with him the information about the job numbers.
[01:18:45.705 --> 01:18:47.326]  They'll share with him the information about
[01:18:47.726 --> 01:18:48.907]  The stock market going up.
[01:18:49.168 --> 01:18:55.153]  But they won't share with him the information about who's getting fired in the administration, about the Obama holders that are coming over.
[01:18:55.214 --> 01:18:56.375]  I've got breaking news on that.
[01:18:56.775 --> 01:19:02.140]  And they won't share with him information on different deals in diplomacy that they're trying to make with foreign policy.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:04.803]  So he tries to go and do something on China, for example.
[01:19:05.043 --> 01:19:06.805]  They turn around and said, oh, no, you can't do that.
[01:19:06.825 --> 01:19:09.067]  We already made a deal with the Chinese behind your back.
[01:19:09.307 --> 01:19:10.749]  And he says, what are you talking about?
[01:19:10.989 --> 01:19:11.850]  And they show it to him then.
[01:19:13.168 --> 01:19:16.871]  That's right, we're going to break all this down, what's behind the McMaster situation.
[01:19:16.931 --> 01:19:28.560]  But doesn't the Young Turks and CNN get, and MSNBC when they fully endorsed him last week to protect him from you and Cernovich and myself and Breitbart and everybody else, just exposing that he's worse than Brennan?
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:32.623]  Not officially converted to Islam like Brennan, but pretty much so.
[01:19:33.403 --> 01:19:35.104]  I mean, that he's totally sold out.
[01:19:36.005 --> 01:19:42.691]  Don't they understand that when they super-endorsed him, that no matter how they try to isolate the president, that's never going to work?
[01:19:42.771 --> 01:19:49.956]  Jack Posobiec, we're going to come back to him to break down what's really behind McMaster and so much more.
[01:19:49.976 --> 01:19:58.804]  And then clips of the individual from the National Security Council, formerly strategist for the Pentagon, that's got them so scared because he's got their number.
[01:19:58.844 --> 01:20:02.326]  He discovered the Obama holdovers, islamicists.
[01:20:08.815 --> 01:20:13.638]  An illegal teenage immigrant from Honduras has been charged with killing his mother.
[01:20:13.778 --> 01:20:19.582]  Funiez is a so-called dreamer protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.
[01:20:20.963 --> 01:20:25.866]  A truck had smashed the family's car on the right side.
[01:20:25.886 --> 01:20:28.608]  That's where Lennox was sitting in his little car seat.
[01:20:29.048 --> 01:20:33.051]  Border officials say Banda is a Mexican national in the country illegally.
[01:20:33.511 --> 01:20:35.212]  He's been deported 15 times in 15 years.
[01:20:38.274 --> 01:20:48.478]  Uvia Lopez has a sordid story that includes a prior deportation and identity fraud in addition to the sexual assault of a friend's teenage daughter.
[01:20:48.818 --> 01:20:53.440]  But I have a simple message today for every gang member and criminal alien.
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:21:00.983]  We will find you, we will arrest you, we will jail you, and we will deport you.
[01:21:11.573 --> 01:21:13.436]  He was deported a whopping eight times.
[01:21:13.756 --> 01:21:16.380]  Suspected in a deadly hit-and-run earlier this week.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:21.747]  He's charged with sex abuse, sodomy, burglary, robbery, assault, and kidnapping.
[01:21:22.027 --> 01:21:26.053]  Court records show he's been deported and returned 20 different times.
[01:21:26.273 --> 01:21:29.197]  The father of two killed in a horrifying crash.
[01:21:29.597 --> 01:21:34.359]  Police say that the driver was a drunk, unlicensed, illegal immigrant.
[01:21:34.619 --> 01:21:41.281]  According to an ICE news release, he is a known gang member and has been previously deported four times.
[01:21:41.801 --> 01:21:49.924]  Tonight, police say an illegal immigrant with a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit slammed into the back of an SUV carrying a family of four.
[01:21:50.404 --> 01:21:53.045]  He had been arrested just hours before this crash.
[01:22:01.087 --> 01:22:09.712]  A woman telling deputies she was sure she was going to die after deputies say this man, Juan Ortega Orozco, broke into her home and cracked into her bed.
[01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:11.293]  He's in this country illegally.
[01:22:12.734 --> 01:22:15.656]  He has a rich criminal history of violating the law.
[01:22:15.776 --> 01:22:22.080]  In the past two years, he's been charged with five felonies, including trafficking meth and leading the scene of a crash.
[01:22:33.706 --> 01:22:42.191]  Domaine Daniels says in a change from under the Obama administration, federal agents now appear to be rounding up any undocumented person they come in contact with.
[01:22:42.231 --> 01:22:45.854]  Federal agents eating breakfast one minute, arresting restaurant staff the next.
[01:22:46.354 --> 01:22:49.656]  Illegal border crossings are down reportedly 70%.
[01:22:50.577 --> 01:22:56.180]  Arrests inside the country are up 40% and demands for removal up 80% as well.
[01:22:57.741 --> 01:23:00.804]  But, you know, we can't apologize for enforcing the law.
[01:23:00.844 --> 01:23:04.848]  If you break the law, that's a choice that you make, and there are consequences to that.
[01:23:33.755 --> 01:23:38.398]  We have private-labeled it, and it is the exact same product, just the name is different.
[01:23:38.578 --> 01:23:39.439]  Emrix Essentials.
[01:23:39.799 --> 01:23:41.740]  It's on average 20% off.
[01:23:42.001 --> 01:23:47.264]  On top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 25% off.
[01:23:47.644 --> 01:23:51.487]  Emrix Essentials is all about personal care.
[01:23:51.927 --> 01:23:52.548]  Hygiene.
[01:23:52.868 --> 01:23:54.089]  Not getting skin cancer.
[01:23:54.569 --> 01:23:57.091]  Not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and mosquitoes.
[01:23:57.591 --> 01:23:58.572]  It's all there.
[01:23:58.852 --> 01:24:03.535]  Infowarsandlife.com, Infowarsstore.com, and you'll find Emrix Essentials.
[01:24:06.397 --> 01:24:29.435]  You see, there's always been such subterfuge in our government, in the last 30, 40 years particularly, that different power factions would battle over manipulating the special interests.
[01:24:31.178 --> 01:24:41.142]  And now President Trump has come in, gotten rid of all the lobbyists, and literally now looks at each thing about what is fair, and what is good for the economy, and what is good for security.
[01:24:43.203 --> 01:24:48.505]  It is the most pragmatic, direct, honest, good governing I've ever seen.
[01:24:49.437 --> 01:24:51.939]  And when he makes mistakes, he finds out about it and changes it.
[01:24:51.979 --> 01:24:52.920]  He doesn't flip-flop.
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:54.861]  He says, I was wrong and changes it.
[01:24:54.961 --> 01:24:55.902]  It's so refreshing.
[01:24:56.603 --> 01:25:06.970]  And the special interests that had hijacked and were running this country, and who were dominating the globe through our treasure, through our energy, have sold out to radical Islam, have sold out to communist China.
[01:25:08.532 --> 01:25:12.655]  They're the traitors, and they are now panicking that Trump's dismantled this.
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.841]  You know, you tell Trump, sir, they're in the New York Times saying they're spying on you.
[01:25:17.181 --> 01:25:18.422]  Then he says, hey, don't spy on me.
[01:25:18.442 --> 01:25:19.442]  And they go, we never did that.
[01:25:19.462 --> 01:25:20.863]  And he goes, here's the New York Times.
[01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:23.003]  Then they say, oh, he's wrong.
[01:25:23.043 --> 01:25:23.844]  We never said that.
[01:25:24.364 --> 01:25:26.424]  As if we don't have the cover of the New York Times.
[01:25:26.805 --> 01:25:29.205]  They talk to us like we're morons.
[01:25:30.526 --> 01:25:31.626]  It's called gaslighting.
[01:25:33.307 --> 01:25:35.908]  Now this is a short segment, long segment coming up with Jack Posobiec.
[01:25:36.707 --> 01:25:42.549]  I want to walk through all this because a lot of smart people, quote smart, are hedging their bets.
[01:25:43.090 --> 01:25:46.951]  When you get something this real, you don't hedge your bets, you're all in.
[01:25:47.251 --> 01:25:49.132]  Especially when there's no hedging your bet.
[01:25:49.572 --> 01:25:54.054]  Going along with the globalists doesn't mean they pat you on the head and you get a seat at the table.
[01:25:54.494 --> 01:25:59.296]  It just means you're delusional when you stand around a church or the water cooler
[01:25:59.716 --> 01:26:02.598]  And go, yeah, I'm kind of mad at Trump, too.
[01:26:03.238 --> 01:26:10.762]  And you buy into all the backbiting when he is epically carrying this country on his shoulders.
[01:26:10.922 --> 01:26:22.629]  I cannot help but admire President Trump, and I want to salute and thank all of you that are praying for President Trump, and ask you to pray for us as well, because we are changing the world together.
[01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:24.630]  We are beginning to turn the corner.
[01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:29.472]  And this is such a historic fight and it's a test of mind control.
[01:26:29.933 --> 01:26:34.555]  Can media mind control break the back of the people and stop this revolution?
[01:26:34.815 --> 01:26:35.876]  And the answer is no.
[01:26:36.516 --> 01:26:40.999]  The question is do we defeat them right now and have a big huge win and society turn around?
[01:26:41.019 --> 01:26:41.059]  Or...
[01:26:44.986 --> 01:26:46.026]  Is Trump just a beachhead?
[01:26:46.046 --> 01:26:46.847]  They destroy him.
[01:26:46.907 --> 01:26:47.687]  We move forward.
[01:26:47.967 --> 01:26:49.087]  Populism awakens.
[01:26:49.147 --> 01:26:50.228]  Globalism's in trouble.
[01:26:50.528 --> 01:26:50.928]  Crippled.
[01:26:51.168 --> 01:26:52.288]  And we move forward from there.
[01:26:52.529 --> 01:26:55.049]  They fight back with authoritarianism to try to shut us down.
[01:26:55.329 --> 01:26:56.230]  It'll probably go hot.
[01:26:57.150 --> 01:26:59.351]  I don't want to go down that road, but we don't have a choice.
[01:26:59.751 --> 01:27:01.732]  Either way, we fight, we win.
[01:27:01.992 --> 01:27:02.612]  Jack Posobiec.
[01:27:04.448 --> 01:27:05.529]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:27:05.849 --> 01:27:09.713]  And what Peter Thiel was saying, I think that BuzzFeed is really taking him out of context here.
[01:27:09.753 --> 01:27:16.819]  He was saying that the fight against the deep state, the fight against the entrenched establishment, is harder than he thought it would be.
[01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:18.520]  It is fiercer than he thought it would be.
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:24.185]  And that is why he sees them fighting so hard and sees President Trump fighting back against them as hard.
[01:27:24.205 --> 01:27:27.428]  You know, you talk about these warrantless wiretaps and FISA courts.
[01:27:27.947 --> 01:27:29.968]  Who set up the warrantless wiretap system?
[01:27:30.028 --> 01:27:31.508]  Why, it was Robert Mueller.
[01:27:31.788 --> 01:27:39.891]  The same Robert Mueller we're now told is the independent special counsel who's investigating this Russia stuff and that there's no ties or bias to him whatsoever.
[01:27:40.131 --> 01:27:49.894]  This is the same Robert Mueller who was tied to the wiretapping, the same Robert Mueller who was tied to Iraq WMD, the anthrax hoax where they actually... He's hoax Mueller!
[01:27:49.974 --> 01:27:51.854]  He's the opposite of independent.
[01:27:52.255 --> 01:27:53.355]  He's the opposite of independent.
[01:27:55.145 --> 01:27:57.368]  You're right, and now we're told to forget all of that.
[01:27:57.408 --> 01:28:07.319]  It's like the entire mainstream media has amnesia when they talk about him because they come up and say, well, he's completely independent and, you know, he's like Jimmy Stewart there in Washington as a G-man.
[01:28:07.539 --> 01:28:11.104]  No, I would say he's more like J. Edgar Hoover when it comes to the FBI.
[01:28:11.164 --> 01:28:13.827]  Using blackmail, using control, absolutely.
[01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:19.555]  And I'm not even really sure he ever really gave up the reins of the FBI to James Comey.
[01:28:19.595 --> 01:28:23.720]  Remember, he stayed there for two extra years after Obama came into power.
[01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:28.226]  He asked him to stay on for two extra years and then hand it over to his very good friend James Comey.
[01:28:28.526 --> 01:28:34.834]  His and Comey's relationship has been described in DC as one of the closest relationships of any two members.
[01:28:36.215 --> 01:28:41.261]  It's an evil power group.
[01:28:41.321 --> 01:28:46.686]  It's an evil, unconstitutional, little wannabe coup group that really thinks so much of themselves.
[01:28:46.947 --> 01:28:47.868]  And that's what I hate, man.
[01:28:47.908 --> 01:28:51.031]  I want to see this evil power over America broken.
[01:28:51.071 --> 01:28:51.391]  Don't you?
[01:28:51.411 --> 01:28:55.576]  Aren't you sick of the Cabals and the Clintons and all these globalists that are so arrogant?
[01:28:57.123 --> 01:28:57.664]  It's ridiculous.
[01:28:57.684 --> 01:29:06.971]  They're going to send somebody out here, someone who's working for the Bush administration, someone who's tied to the Clintons as well, and they're going to tell us that we have to listen to him as well because we see what's going on.
[01:29:07.011 --> 01:29:09.372]  We see the establishment going up against Trump.
[01:29:09.653 --> 01:29:15.937]  They call Trump a traitor while they're trying to overthrow the democratically elected government of the United States.
[01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:16.378]  Period.
[01:29:16.458 --> 01:29:17.038]  It's disgusting.
[01:29:17.058 --> 01:29:19.380]  All right, we got a long segment coming up.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:24.744]  I want to really, because I've done a lot of research, you've done a lot of research, and I saw the stuff about McMaster.
[01:29:24.804 --> 01:29:26.045]  I knew a lot of it, but I spent
[01:29:27.419 --> 01:29:30.140]  Probably eight hours off and on this weekend or more.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:31.821]  I guess I did more research Sunday.
[01:29:31.901 --> 01:29:34.102]  I did like ten hours research.
[01:29:35.462 --> 01:29:39.224]  I had to on him and it was just he was a rabbit hole.
[01:29:39.364 --> 01:29:41.864]  I just right when you think you know it all it gets ten times worse.
[01:29:42.005 --> 01:29:52.949]  I mean McMaster is just nightmarish and but through who he's fired it gives you a window into exactly the type of nasty Islamist agents we're dealing with.
[01:29:53.089 --> 01:29:55.990]  I mean they buy these guys off folks and they are.
[01:29:57.139 --> 01:30:00.542]  They just want to blow up Western civilization, just like they blow up all the churches.
[01:30:17.182 --> 01:30:24.844]  You've got you, who's on one side of the equation here, pro-America, very outspoken, likes Trump, but you're not just all about Trump.
[01:30:24.904 --> 01:30:37.228]  It's about, you like his message, you like the America First policy, you want to see a justice system treating immigrants fairly, where people can't just walk right across the border, you have to go through the process that everybody else went to that pays taxes.
[01:30:37.788 --> 01:30:41.469]  So you're on that side of the fence, which to me is just logical, pro-America.
[01:30:41.989 --> 01:30:43.830]  But you've got artists on the other side of the fence.
[01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:44.950]  I'll use Katy Perry.
[01:30:45.650 --> 01:30:48.751]  Katy Perry has admitted she sold her soul to the devil.
[01:30:48.791 --> 01:30:50.351]  That's what she says young girls need to do.
[01:30:50.952 --> 01:30:51.992]  She chopped her hair off.
[01:30:52.052 --> 01:30:53.232]  Maybe that's something she wanted to do.
[01:30:53.292 --> 01:30:56.233]  Maybe that's something they do because you know how they want to blur the lines of gender.
[01:30:56.693 --> 01:31:07.736]  But I'm just curious, where... I mean there's such this great divide between someone like Katy Perry who says coexist right after a great terrorist attack against Christians and then someone like you who just says, well I just want to be pro-America.
[01:31:08.176 --> 01:31:09.837]  How does the divide get created like that?
[01:31:11.303 --> 01:31:16.925]  I think it's, I mean, a lot of media creates that divide, and also it's an artist who's not genuine to herself.
[01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:20.426]  I can say that she doesn't seem like she's been herself for a few years.
[01:31:20.446 --> 01:31:28.369]  You know, she started attacking other celebrities for having, you know, mental health issues and problems, and then she seems to be having those problems.
[01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:40.938]  And like, I don't want to create any sort of attack on any other artist, but when you act like that, when you come out in that such an odd, weird way, to where, you know, you have live therapy sessions online, and it's like, where's your music?
[01:31:41.038 --> 01:31:42.699]  What's happening with your artistry?
[01:31:42.759 --> 01:31:45.941]  Why are you not focused on your feelings on this, that, and the other?
[01:31:45.961 --> 01:31:47.423]  And they're not even really political.
[01:31:47.443 --> 01:31:50.645]  They're just, oh, let's all hug each other and pretend like everything's okay.
[01:31:51.065 --> 01:31:52.106]  That's not the truth.
[01:31:52.206 --> 01:31:53.447]  We do need closed borders.
[01:31:53.467 --> 01:31:57.530]  We need to protect ourselves and our family, and it's very important, and that's
[01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:59.151]  That is common sense.
[01:31:59.391 --> 01:32:01.133]  And a lot of these artists don't have that.
[01:32:01.233 --> 01:32:06.977]  And I don't think that they should be pushing their ideals when they really truly don't know what they're talking about and they don't want to.
[01:32:07.337 --> 01:32:09.339]  They don't have any sort of sense in it.
[01:32:09.399 --> 01:32:11.600]  They just want to say something that's sunshine and rainbows.
[01:32:12.281 --> 01:32:19.246]  And to me, it comes from a lack of genuine knowledge of how everyday Americans are operating.
[01:32:19.266 --> 01:32:26.732]  And I come from a hardworking family, you know, and I feel like my values are conservative values that my parents taught me.
[01:32:27.252 --> 01:32:31.676]  And I always knew these were common sense values and it seems like it's just lacking.
[01:32:31.716 --> 01:32:43.446]  I think that these people come from a place where they're so far removed from what normal people are dealing with that they don't know how to speak in terms that can be even looked at as normal anymore.
[01:32:43.486 --> 01:32:45.568]  They're just, they're basically talking out of their butt.
[01:32:45.908 --> 01:32:46.789]  That's what I want to say.
[01:32:48.186 --> 01:32:49.086]  That's how I feel.
[01:32:49.646 --> 01:32:56.628]  So as long as we keep a smile on our face, we keep going, we keep creating, we keep, you know, saying, no, we're not going to be beaten down.
[01:32:56.668 --> 01:32:57.728]  We're going to keep going.
[01:32:57.748 --> 01:32:59.728]  We're going to win this war.
[01:32:59.768 --> 01:33:01.009]  The better we will be.
[01:33:02.349 --> 01:33:09.250]  We are on the march.
[01:33:09.490 --> 01:33:12.011]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:33:12.751 --> 01:33:16.492]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:19.682 --> 01:33:29.250]  It's not like I get up here and I tell you, hey, spread our videos, spread our articles, and we'll change the world together, and I'm just saying that.
[01:33:29.610 --> 01:33:30.371]  It's really happening.
[01:33:31.391 --> 01:33:36.336]  And they admittedly, Google's hired private companies to try to delist us on the internet.
[01:33:36.817 --> 01:33:40.000]  They've got groups out there claiming our information is bots.
[01:33:40.801 --> 01:33:43.404]  And so they'll just delist our videos or block our tweets.
[01:33:43.964 --> 01:33:49.049]  They've just done the same thing to Trump today because a tweet got through that he could see at the top.
[01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:54.194]  Because they have it set where only negative tweets get to the top using real bots.
[01:33:54.274 --> 01:33:57.437]  Facebook, Twitter, Google, they all admit to using them against Trump.
[01:33:57.937 --> 01:34:04.303]  And then so somebody did use a bot to be able to get around that and vote it up so that he could see it.
[01:34:04.803 --> 01:34:09.668]  So they deleted that person's account saying you used a system to beat our AI.
[01:34:11.067 --> 01:34:16.469]  Remember our Google bomb that listeners developed, where every day I could control the search results on Google?
[01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:20.091]  I would only use it like every few weeks though, I should have used it every day.
[01:34:20.111 --> 01:34:25.514]  Because after three years of Google bombs, they changed the entire Google algorithm to stop us.
[01:34:26.954 --> 01:34:27.454]  Remember that?
[01:34:28.755 --> 01:34:33.017]  Now sure, we had millions of listeners, you were searching the term, but
[01:34:34.633 --> 01:34:46.959]  Then they started trying to block us in real time, so programmers came up with bots that would hammer the term thousands of times a second per bot entry, basically, and so they learned to block those.
[01:34:47.119 --> 01:34:51.762]  Well, they used the exact same stuff, but many times more sophisticated against us.
[01:34:52.842 --> 01:34:56.263]  But nothing can stop you calling into C-SPAN and plugging InfoWars.com.
[01:34:56.363 --> 01:35:00.724]  Nothing can stop you from working into the conversation saying, I think InfoWars.com is the real news.
[01:35:01.244 --> 01:35:02.264]  That's why it's cutting edge.
[01:35:02.284 --> 01:35:05.205]  That's why it's exposing the dinosaur media that's collapsing.
[01:35:05.245 --> 01:35:05.825]  What do you think?
[01:35:06.846 --> 01:35:08.446]  Bring it into the conversations.
[01:35:08.986 --> 01:35:10.587]  Calling into National Talk Radio.
[01:35:10.667 --> 01:35:12.547]  Calling in to CNN.
[01:35:12.967 --> 01:35:14.348]  Calling into these programs.
[01:35:14.408 --> 01:35:15.468]  Letting them know you're awake.
[01:35:15.948 --> 01:35:17.228]  Spreading our articles, our videos.
[01:35:17.268 --> 01:35:18.229]  It's changing the world.
[01:35:19.029 --> 01:35:19.609]  But also,
[01:35:21.112 --> 01:35:33.997]  Remembering that when you financially support us, getting products like high quality water filtration, air filtration systems, supplements, nutraceuticals, Patriot apparel, books, films, you name it, like Milo's new book.
[01:35:34.557 --> 01:35:38.599]  When you buy from us, you get really good deals, products you need.
[01:35:40.419 --> 01:35:43.623]  And it makes the tip of the spear possible because we're not funded by George Soros.
[01:35:43.983 --> 01:35:51.052]  We didn't get a couple billion dollars like NBC's parent company for MSNBC and CNBC to give Rachel Maddow a raise.
[01:35:52.393 --> 01:35:53.635]  We don't get globalist money.
[01:35:53.655 --> 01:35:56.097]  We just find the best products out there like Alexa Breeze.
[01:35:57.455 --> 01:36:03.897]  We were going to stop having this at 25% off because it's already at $219 for this space age air filtration system.
[01:36:04.358 --> 01:36:08.759]  Just a few years ago, when we first offered it, it was like $800 a unit or similar units.
[01:36:09.119 --> 01:36:09.720]  We were offering for $250.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:10.460]  Now they're $219 normally.
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:11.260]  They're $149.
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:12.121]  No one can top a deal like this.
[01:36:12.141 --> 01:36:12.581]  And it was so popular.
[01:36:12.601 --> 01:36:12.941]  It was a big sale.
[01:36:18.883 --> 01:36:20.484]  So a lot of folks asked us to bring it back.
[01:36:20.524 --> 01:36:23.227]  The manufacturer asked us to bring it back because it's so successful.
[01:36:23.487 --> 01:36:26.109]  They've given us a great deal on it or we wouldn't make any money at this price.
[01:36:26.469 --> 01:36:27.931]  I can tell you that's how discounted it is.
[01:36:28.211 --> 01:36:34.776]  So the manufacturers had to give us the super, super low price to basically be like, they're making like $5 or something on it at this price.
[01:36:35.597 --> 01:36:39.400]  And we're making like, you know, 30, 40 bucks, which we need to make to fund the operation.
[01:36:39.941 --> 01:36:42.383]  So Alexa Pure Breeze, a great deal at $219, $149 right now.
[01:36:46.522 --> 01:36:48.383]  At InfowarsStore.com.
[01:36:48.403 --> 01:36:51.906]  And we have the 1776 specials we're running throughout the month.
[01:36:52.346 --> 01:36:53.947]  Brainforce, 55% off, 1776.
[01:36:54.047 --> 01:36:58.931]  Survival Shield, the amazing X2, 1776.
[01:36:58.971 --> 01:37:00.212]  Great way to stockpile that.
[01:37:00.292 --> 01:37:01.673]  Secret 12, Mythical Ballerman.
[01:37:01.993 --> 01:37:02.834]  Organic B12, 1776.
[01:37:03.614 --> 01:37:08.097]  It's never been easier to get these high-quality products and support the broadcast.
[01:37:08.117 --> 01:37:13.822]  And if you sign up for AutoShip every 15 days, every 30, every 60, every 90, cancel any time, no charge.
[01:37:14.622 --> 01:37:25.606]  It's an additional 10% off that way you get it over and over and over and over and over again and don't have to continue to re redo it each time when you forget and you get the discount.
[01:37:25.886 --> 01:37:27.246]  So that way it's like a tithe.
[01:37:27.546 --> 01:37:29.767]  It's like a commitment to support the broadcast.
[01:37:30.717 --> 01:37:34.538]  By the way, it has 4.8 stars, Secret 12.
[01:37:35.378 --> 01:37:41.939]  2,499 reviews, 4.8 stars, with Power Reviews, one of the biggest third-party sites out there.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:43.380]  Unbelievable.
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:45.080]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:46.981]  You understand this is a war.
[01:37:47.461 --> 01:37:52.682]  Now, going back to Jack Posobiec, everybody follow on Twitter at Jack Posobiec, citizensfortrump.com.
[01:37:55.014 --> 01:37:59.115]  Investigative journalist, more and more, doing great reportage for us as well up there in DC.
[01:37:59.235 --> 01:37:59.935]  Bold fighter.
[01:38:00.635 --> 01:38:02.396]  Let's get into the big issue here.
[01:38:03.096 --> 01:38:05.857]  This window into how they plan to bring down Trump.
[01:38:06.557 --> 01:38:10.698]  The hoax they're selling, just like Hillary couldn't be beaten, he's going to be taken out.
[01:38:10.998 --> 01:38:16.199]  They're bold statements that they're preparing to just remove him in some type of coup.
[01:38:16.559 --> 01:38:18.140]  They have to go public with it.
[01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:19.480]  People say, why have a public coup?
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:27.302]  Because they have to legitimize it in the minds of media, the public, and the people that they're trying to get ready for this coup.
[01:38:27.362 --> 01:38:28.622]  You talk about dangerous.
[01:38:29.462 --> 01:38:30.543]  Separation of powers.
[01:38:30.583 --> 01:38:32.463]  The president has a right to fight this coup.
[01:38:32.703 --> 01:38:33.623]  In fact, he has a duty.
[01:38:34.084 --> 01:38:36.604]  But they're going to say that's a terrorist operation.
[01:38:36.964 --> 01:38:39.605]  They're going to seize control of the media with the Obama kill switch.
[01:38:40.185 --> 01:38:41.545]  That's why they're isolating the president.
[01:38:41.565 --> 01:38:43.326]  That's why Twitter's censoring him.
[01:38:44.284 --> 01:38:50.828]  Meanwhile, McMaster worked at Think Tank, backed by Soros-funded group that helped Obama sell Iran deal.
[01:38:50.868 --> 01:38:56.572]  That's the latest from Breitbart today, showing Bannon's fighting back, showing Bannon's true colors, that he is a patriot.
[01:38:56.972 --> 01:38:58.373]  Deep State's going to kill the president.
[01:38:58.453 --> 01:38:59.534]  Alex Jones, Newsweek.
[01:39:00.014 --> 01:39:05.558]  Report McMaster fired National Security Council official for penning memo on globalists and their alliance with Islam.
[01:39:06.198 --> 01:39:07.439]  And it explains the whole thing.
[01:39:07.459 --> 01:39:10.461]  We're going to play in the next hour, link the excerpts of that.
[01:39:11.308 --> 01:39:17.413]  But let's walk through why a top FBI agent warns McMaster is the enemy camp.
[01:39:18.233 --> 01:39:22.617]  I mean, you think we just had Brennan over the CIA that's converted to Wahhabism?
[01:39:23.878 --> 01:39:30.143]  Folks, you think Mueller took Islam, radical Islam, off the list of terrorism and made it Christians, being the number one threat group with no evidence?
[01:39:31.063 --> 01:39:33.045]  This didn't just happen overnight.
[01:39:33.145 --> 01:39:34.866]  There's a billion and a half Muslims.
[01:39:35.147 --> 01:39:37.528]  There's going to be three billion by 2027, ten years from now, 2026.
[01:39:41.448 --> 01:39:43.049]  The globalists have made their bet.
[01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:44.751]  We've been domesticated.
[01:39:44.791 --> 01:39:45.592]  We've been made weak.
[01:39:45.872 --> 01:39:47.794]  Now they're bringing in military-age men.
[01:39:48.474 --> 01:39:49.655]  They're putting them in positions of power.
[01:39:49.675 --> 01:39:50.976]  Europe's already falling.
[01:39:51.637 --> 01:40:03.667]  I have to say to a lot of the hardcore right-wingers who said this 20 years ago, I thought you were nuts about caliphate, about Sharia law, because I couldn't imagine even our own evil elite would do something this crazy.
[01:40:04.068 --> 01:40:05.929]  But they hate Christianity so much,
[01:40:06.832 --> 01:40:17.502]  And are so committed that they funded ISIS and Al Qaeda that blew up thousands of churches in the Middle East the last six years, under Obama, the Muslim Brotherhood, his cousin, Odinga, all of it.
[01:40:17.542 --> 01:40:18.463]  It's come out in court.
[01:40:20.083 --> 01:40:30.969]  This was an actual super double-cross, and now we're in red-level crisis, and they're sabotaging the military with trannies and sex changes to sabotage it.
[01:40:31.449 --> 01:40:35.411]  Jack Posobiec, while defending Islamists is throwing gay people off buildings.
[01:40:35.452 --> 01:40:39.614]  Jack, lay this out for us, your report, while you're really here on McMaster.
[01:40:41.309 --> 01:40:48.653]  One of the top things that I can break today, my sources confirmed to me that there are four people on the NSC that are still on the NSC.
[01:40:48.713 --> 01:40:58.078]  Not only are they holdovers from the Obama administration, but these people are direct reports to Ben Rhodes, the former Obama security advisor.
[01:40:58.339 --> 01:41:01.981]  So they were people that were directly working for Ben Rhodes.
[01:41:02.041 --> 01:41:05.943]  Ben Rhodes, as we know, is still in communication with Barack Obama.
[01:41:06.513 --> 01:41:13.737]  For all intents and purposes, you can say that these people are working on the NSC, but are still able to get information back to Barack Obama.
[01:41:13.757 --> 01:41:27.886]  It's Abigail Grace, Fernando Coutts, Andrea Hall, and Mary Lynn, four members, each special assistants in different sections of the NSC, special assistants... They're all over the key hiring, so that's how they create the logjams.
[01:41:30.188 --> 01:41:40.452]  Right, and so they will prevent anyone from being hired that is with the Trump campaign, that is with Trump in terms of ideology, like Rich Higgins was.
[01:41:40.692 --> 01:41:47.614]  And if they find out that someone was, like Rich Higgins, KT McFarlane, Tara Dahl, Derek Harvey, they're immediately sent out.
[01:41:47.654 --> 01:41:49.535]  And the main reason these people are sent out
[01:41:49.835 --> 01:41:55.079]  Is because they are able to get information to President Trump that they don't want getting to him.
[01:41:55.119 --> 01:41:56.540]  They want to control his information.
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:01.323]  That's why we're hearing now the closed door of the Oval Office, shutting the door of the Oval Office.
[01:42:01.363 --> 01:42:08.048]  Kelly behind that saying they're going to censor his tweets, saying they don't want, they don't want President Trump looking at Twitter.
[01:42:08.088 --> 01:42:09.289]  They don't want him going to that.
[01:42:09.509 --> 01:42:12.211]  They're going to check with his tweets before they put it out.
[01:42:12.231 --> 01:42:13.532]  So they're going to write his tweets for him.
[01:42:13.772 --> 01:42:14.073]  I think so.
[01:42:23.559 --> 01:42:30.343]  Was not written by the president nor was it seen even by the president that it was put out in his name multiple accounts.
[01:42:30.423 --> 01:42:38.687]  And by the way I got that I got that Sunday when I saw it and Saturday and talked to top people and indeed I've never even said that on air because I don't want to give up any sources.
[01:42:39.027 --> 01:42:40.268]  I guess now it's safe to bring that out.
[01:42:40.528 --> 01:42:42.849]  The president never saw that while he was in New Jersey.
[01:42:43.149 --> 01:42:49.753]  They just are doing whatever they want already acting like he's a buffoon incontinent already acting like you
[01:42:49.753 --> 01:42:52.616]  You know, he needs to be put in a nursing home when he's sharper than all of them put together.
[01:42:52.956 --> 01:42:55.418]  They're already behaving with total belligerence.
[01:42:55.699 --> 01:43:02.165]  And what about the reports that McMaster constantly trashes Trump to everybody, loving being a darling of the media?
[01:43:03.766 --> 01:43:12.695]  Well, McMaster is going around and telling, you know, the president will have a phone call with somebody and then McMaster will call his counterpart and completely counterman everything the president said about it.
[01:43:13.215 --> 01:43:14.997]  McMaster will call and essentially make
[01:43:15.353 --> 01:43:17.775]  How do we stop President McMaster after you make your point?
[01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:51.635]  Sure, we've got to be able to get information to President Trump, whether that's through emissaries, bringing him actual memos, actual documentation into the Oval Office, meeting him personally, either at Trump Tower, he says he's going to be there this week for meetings, going and getting the information directly to him, and people via social media.
[01:43:51.675 --> 01:43:54.036]  They can't stop Trump from getting on social media.
[01:43:54.456 --> 01:43:57.877]  So people going on there, until your ban, until your account is banned and killed, it's
[01:43:58.496 --> 01:43:59.357]  You've got a voice.
[01:43:59.697 --> 01:44:05.743]  You can use that social media as a two-way street of communication between you and the President.
[01:44:05.964 --> 01:44:06.845]  He's going to see it.
[01:44:07.025 --> 01:44:11.690]  We saw one woman, a black conservative, who was trying to get her message to the President.
[01:44:11.710 --> 01:44:15.253]  She got one message to him, he retweets her, and immediately she was suspended.
[01:44:15.514 --> 01:44:19.718]  So the President saw her, and immediately Twitter decided to shut her down.
[01:44:20.018 --> 01:44:24.620]  That is what they're trying to do and that's why it's so important for us to reach out directly to the president.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:27.141]  They want to cut the people off from the president.
[01:44:27.521 --> 01:44:32.183]  They want to put him like in the Forbidden City like they did with Chinese emperors and totally control him.
[01:44:32.223 --> 01:44:38.866]  I mean this is epic to watch and they admit their strategy is to isolate him to bring him down.
[01:44:38.966 --> 01:44:39.966]  I mean this is incredible.
[01:44:40.006 --> 01:44:41.387]  What do you think the president should do?
[01:44:43.372 --> 01:44:47.114]  I think the president at this point should absolutely fire Bob Mueller.
[01:44:47.754 --> 01:44:53.417]  People are making connections back to Archibald Cox and Richard Nixon, the Saturday Night Massacre.
[01:44:53.437 --> 01:44:57.979]  I think if anyone should go, it's Robert Mueller at this point.
[01:44:58.259 --> 01:45:03.302]  He stands as someone who is not independent, who is absolutely not
[01:45:03.732 --> 01:45:05.013]  Uh, independent of the process.
[01:45:05.193 --> 01:45:10.278]  He's been involved since pre-911 with the federal government, with the federal administration, and establishments.
[01:45:10.298 --> 01:45:15.283]  And it'll be seen as strength to get rid of him before they crash the economy.
[01:45:16.892 --> 01:45:34.906]  Right, before they crash the economy, before they're able to essentially, what they want to do with this grand jury is find a way to trump up charges against the president and bring an indictment, or they'll say, we're going to bring an indictment against you, we've got some documents, whether they be true or not, and they're going to ask for the president's resignation.
[01:45:35.146 --> 01:45:39.490]  And they're trying to just spin the wheels and tell him everything is going fine up until they get to that point.
[01:45:39.850 --> 01:45:41.211]  That is Mueller's endgame.
[01:45:41.271 --> 01:45:42.531]  That's the Deep State's endgame.
[01:45:42.551 --> 01:45:45.773]  Exact same thing they've been using against Netanyahu.
[01:45:46.093 --> 01:45:48.114]  Exact same thing they've been using against Netanyahu.
[01:45:49.515 --> 01:45:49.835]  Yes.
[01:45:50.175 --> 01:45:55.658]  They want to make him completely inundated with scandal after scandal so that their agenda can't actually be passed.
[01:45:55.938 --> 01:45:57.599]  They can't get any of the executive orders out.
[01:45:57.639 --> 01:45:59.200]  They can't get legislation passed.
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:00.120]  Think about it, Alex.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:02.161]  Why haven't we seen legislation for the wall?
[01:46:02.639 --> 01:46:04.302]  For infrastructure, for tax cuts.
[01:46:04.582 --> 01:46:12.715]  They're doing all of this to prevent President Trump's agenda from getting put into place because that's the scariest thing possible to this power elite that's out there.
[01:46:13.177 --> 01:46:21.841]  And then they turn around and run another fake Newsweek cover, not the one where they said Hillary was the president, and you know, had how she won, and photos of her winning that night, all fake.
[01:46:22.221 --> 01:46:26.623]  They have a new one of him photoshopped in a chair, lazy, and it says, zero accomplishments.
[01:46:27.183 --> 01:46:40.829]  No, zero accomplishments with the traitors in Congress, through the executive, devastating victories, the economy coming back, the border getting secured, the TPP killed, the carbon tax killed, America open for business again.
[01:46:42.515 --> 01:46:45.337]  When I saw that cover, I thought it was Mad Magazine instead of Newsweek.
[01:46:45.377 --> 01:46:47.658]  I guess we should call it Fake Newsweek for now.
[01:46:47.978 --> 01:46:56.343]  I mean, this is the same media that just a few weeks ago, well, Fake Week, was telling us how President Trump's hectic work schedule was making them all tired.
[01:46:57.144 --> 01:47:00.386]  If there's anything they want to accuse the President of, being lazy is certainly not one of them.
[01:47:00.406 --> 01:47:02.987]  This is a guy two, three hours of sleep at night.
[01:47:03.168 --> 01:47:10.372]  If that, he's constantly working, he's constantly on the phone, and he's been on record for doing that throughout the campaign and the early days of the administration.
[01:47:10.717 --> 01:47:16.103]  So for Newsweek to come out and say it's news to put up a Mad Magazine cover of him, it's ridiculous.
[01:47:16.383 --> 01:47:18.546]  Even other journalists and people that are still trying.
[01:47:19.333 --> 01:47:26.079]  Well, Jack, that's the thing for me.
[01:47:26.159 --> 01:47:28.060]  I watch CNN and MSNBC now.
[01:47:28.901 --> 01:47:33.004]  It's such upside-down world cartoon level that I don't even know what they're doing.
[01:47:33.264 --> 01:47:42.472]  I mean, I played a clip last hour of CNN saying that the new video service, the new news service he's launched, finally the beginning of the fireside chats,
[01:47:42.972 --> 01:47:49.764]  That we know was heavily pushed by the outgoing head of communications, Scaramucci.
[01:47:50.284 --> 01:47:51.847]  They're saying, oh look, fake news.
[01:47:52.188 --> 01:47:55.313]  He's claiming he has good jobs numbers and he's putting it out.
[01:47:55.353 --> 01:47:56.214]  That's not fake news.
[01:47:56.254 --> 01:47:56.815]  That was true.
[01:47:59.736 --> 01:48:01.157]  That's the Labor Department report.
[01:48:01.177 --> 01:48:05.460]  The Labor Department report said 1.07 million jobs in the first six months.
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.942]  We've also seen the new deals from the companies that are coming in.
[01:48:08.962 --> 01:48:10.624]  Carrier refusing to go to Mexico.
[01:48:11.985 --> 01:48:15.707]  Voxconn now coming in putting a $10 billion factory in Wisconsin.
[01:48:15.967 --> 01:48:16.828]  This is not fake.
[01:48:16.888 --> 01:48:18.129]  We've all seen it and we're all seeing it.
[01:48:18.189 --> 01:48:25.594]  However, I would suggest, and I think it's a great step in the right direction with these fireside chats, that the story needs to be told better.
[01:48:25.974 --> 01:48:28.576]  I don't want to just see somebody sitting there reporting the news.
[01:48:28.696 --> 01:48:29.637]  I want to actually see these.
[01:48:29.737 --> 01:48:31.618]  Let's start showing these factories being built.
[01:48:31.858 --> 01:48:35.861]  Let's see the president and these leaders of industries signing these deals, signing these agreements.
[01:48:36.201 --> 01:48:37.322]  Show the people what's going on.
[01:48:37.362 --> 01:48:38.462]  Don't just give me a number.
[01:48:38.762 --> 01:48:40.324]  Show me the people going back to work.
[01:48:40.764 --> 01:48:42.205]  Show me the people what's going on.
[01:48:42.245 --> 01:48:47.388]  Let's show, you know, the shovel full of sand down at the border with the wall being built.
[01:48:47.628 --> 01:48:49.970]  I think once the president knows the power of visual
[01:48:50.230 --> 01:48:58.435]  And they're acting like it's dirty and bad and crazy that he would once a week have a program showing their accomplishments as they block on Twitter, drudge,
[01:49:09.202 --> 01:49:12.326]  Showing the jobs numbers from the federal government.
[01:49:12.386 --> 01:49:15.310]  I mean, they're doing everything they can to kill this economy.
[01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:24.380]  Jack Posobiec, let's specifically look here at, because I'm going to play some of this coming up in the next hour after you're gone, of an actual interview that Rich Higgins from the Pentagon
[01:49:24.901 --> 01:49:25.081]  I think?
[01:49:40.343 --> 01:49:45.050]  And that's what they're so scared of, and that's what McMaster fired him for, because he understands the plan.
[01:49:45.230 --> 01:49:55.224]  One strength the plan has is, it's so dastardly, it's so over-the-top, it's so evil, it's so cunning, that we have trouble even believing it's this ridiculous.
[01:49:55.284 --> 01:49:57.047]  But it's really happening!
[01:49:59.130 --> 01:50:03.352]  And Rich Higgins is someone as well, Alex, who was there as a strategic planner.
[01:50:03.632 --> 01:50:11.635]  His specific job was to look at different things that are going on in the world and try to make sense of it and try to say where it's going to be in 20 years and 30 years.
[01:50:11.996 --> 01:50:21.460]  So he was literally doing his job on the National Security Council and stating, this is what I think the enemy's strategic vision is for the United States.
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:24.521]  You can agree with it or disagree with it, but this is how I'm going to write it up.
[01:50:25.191 --> 01:50:29.534]  Why would anyone fire somebody for doing their job when it comes to that sense?
[01:50:29.714 --> 01:50:36.099]  He was doing his job, he shared his memo out with people at the administration, the minute McMaster found out about it, he got rid of him.
[01:50:36.159 --> 01:50:39.862]  So it seems that he may have been doing his job a little bit too well, Alex.
[01:50:40.362 --> 01:50:45.405]  It's just incredible when I research this, and big parts of the interview that's got no play are coming up in the next hour.
[01:50:45.745 --> 01:50:47.326]  Roger Stone's going to pop in as well.
[01:50:47.366 --> 01:50:59.633]  I will open the phones up then, but we have just got to look at one more segment with you, Posobiec, because we just calmly talk about Brennan and all these people talking about removing the president outside of law, but through a coup.
[01:51:00.273 --> 01:51:02.515]  How are they going to try this coup, and what happens if they do?
[01:51:03.371 --> 01:51:09.193]  In ancient times, man roamed the earth in a constant state of hunting or being hunted.
[01:51:09.353 --> 01:51:14.515]  Introducing Caveman, where cutting-edge science meets ancient super nutrients.
[01:51:14.755 --> 01:51:18.256]  Secure your bottle right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:51:18.396 --> 01:51:30.480]  Since the time of Hippocrates, the father of modern western medicine, in 420 BC, the ancients have marveled at the power of whey protein from milk and cheese.
[01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:38.085]  That's why I'm so proud to announce the latest addition to the InfoWars Life family, True Whey Protein from InfoWars Life.
[01:51:38.405 --> 01:51:44.349]  It's produced right here in the United States of America under the strictest high-quality organic conditions.
[01:51:44.929 --> 01:51:48.492]  Our True Whey Protein from InfoWars Life contains a whopping
[01:51:49.292 --> 01:51:51.653]  20 grams of protein per serving.
[01:51:52.093 --> 01:51:59.315]  We went out and did massive research and found the very best company and facility to develop our whey.
[01:51:59.475 --> 01:52:12.139]  And it took us years to finally get contacts with some of the larger, most respected companies to bring you a super high quality whey protein at a very reasonable price.
[01:52:12.639 --> 01:52:13.980]  That way you get the benefits
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:20.202]  And the taste of high-quality whey while supporting our information warfare operation against the globalists.
[01:52:20.523 --> 01:52:23.044]  Doing our research, one thing continued to really stand out.
[01:52:23.584 --> 01:52:32.247]  It's not just that cows and their milk are associated with the best, highest quality protein, but also that those cows be grass-fed.
[01:52:32.648 --> 01:52:33.488]  That is essential.
[01:52:33.868 --> 01:52:38.130]  And all of this whey protein comes from grass-fed, happy cows.
[01:52:38.630 --> 01:52:41.072]  This is the very best way that we were able to bring to market.
[01:52:41.432 --> 01:52:43.134]  Please try it for yourself and tell us what you think.
[01:52:43.154 --> 01:52:44.875]  Again, thank you so much for all your support.
[01:52:45.416 --> 01:52:48.218]  It is true whey from m4warslife.com.
[01:52:48.398 --> 01:52:57.005]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?

[01:53:17.175 --> 01:53:17.375]  Woo!
[01:53:17.435 --> 01:53:18.356]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:53:18.476 --> 01:53:25.159]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store,
[01:53:25.319 --> 01:53:27.060]  There is no comparison.
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:36.428]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:53:36.788 --> 01:53:40.111]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:53:40.231 --> 01:53:44.194]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:53:44.354 --> 01:53:45.275]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:54:13.038 --> 01:54:14.659]  I've got some really good news.
[01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:21.764]  Anti-gun activists face bankruptcy after filing frivolous lawsuits.
[01:54:23.285 --> 01:54:25.566]  Now the good news is they face bankruptcy.
[01:54:25.907 --> 01:54:41.477]  The good news is their lawsuit was thrown out and all the lawsuits are being thrown out against gun manufacturers when somebody on Prozac who illegally gets a gun or another serotonin reuptake inhibitor goes and kills some people
[01:54:42.625 --> 01:54:45.147]  That's not the fault of the gun maker or the gun shop.
[01:54:46.288 --> 01:54:47.529]  They sold the firearm legally.
[01:54:47.929 --> 01:54:55.174]  Just like if a nutball goes and gets a Ford Civic or a Chevy Tahoe and runs over to a crowd of people.
[01:54:55.195 --> 01:54:56.175]  Do you sue Chevy?
[01:54:57.116 --> 01:54:57.897]  And the shareholders?
[01:54:57.957 --> 01:54:58.097]  No!
[01:55:00.914 --> 01:55:02.875]  Execute the guy that did it, if he did it on purpose.
[01:55:02.895 --> 01:55:04.055]  Or you throw him in prison.
[01:55:04.355 --> 01:55:06.456]  You don't sue the car maker.
[01:55:06.936 --> 01:55:07.576]  That's coming up.
[01:55:07.857 --> 01:55:13.659]  Now, Jack Posobiec, my job is to beat the drum on issues and force them out into consciousness.
[01:55:14.079 --> 01:55:16.180]  This isn't your normal entertainment radio show.
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:16.840]  Everybody knows that.
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:19.241]  This is an organic...
[01:55:19.941 --> 01:55:26.185]  Patriot, military operation against the globalists, from behind enemy lines, in occupied North America.
[01:55:26.745 --> 01:55:28.846]  You know, we say that, it's not a joke, it's not theatrics.
[01:55:29.166 --> 01:55:35.950]  We still haven't gotten the country back, we've got major beachheads, we've launched major offensives, but we're in the middle of the fight of our lives.
[01:55:36.290 --> 01:55:38.812]  Globally, there's a fight against globalism as well, as you know.
[01:55:38.832 --> 01:55:45.796]  We've got a lot of other fellow patriots around the planet, from Brazil, to the UK, to you name it, to Catalonia, to Russia, fighting the same fight.
[01:55:46.596 --> 01:55:52.859]  But just in closing, they're all over the place saying kill him, overthrow him, remove him, COG, 25th Amendment.
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:55.721]  They really are planning to make the move, I believe, soon.
[01:55:55.741 --> 01:55:56.602]  A, do you believe that?
[01:55:56.742 --> 01:55:58.543]  C, how might they do it?
[01:55:58.643 --> 01:56:00.324]  What do we do if they blow his head off?
[01:56:00.704 --> 01:56:02.845]  They're going to try to activate riots nationwide.
[01:56:02.885 --> 01:56:04.666]  I mean, I just can't believe we're in this position.
[01:56:05.026 --> 01:56:06.927]  I think Trump and the Justice Department have to move against him.
[01:56:09.108 --> 01:56:11.670]  Alex, that's their game plan and that's their endgame for all of this.
[01:56:12.338 --> 01:56:21.607]  They want the president to either resign on his own or they're going to try to bring some kind of charges against him, fake charges that are completely without merit.
[01:56:22.063 --> 01:56:26.006]  If they do that, this is not going to be like the 1970s.
[01:56:26.366 --> 01:56:38.915]  This is going to be much, much worse because half of the country has seen for the past two years the vilification of this man, a private citizen at first, trying to do the right thing for his country.
[01:56:39.135 --> 01:56:43.898]  The entire establishment of the Beltway, the entire media has gone against him.
[01:56:44.238 --> 01:56:48.581]  If Trump had done something wrong that was that egregious by now, believe me, Alex, I think we'd know it.
[01:56:49.833 --> 01:56:53.476]  So half of the country knows how hard he is fighting.
[01:56:53.576 --> 01:57:02.162]  That half of the country is not going to slink away quietly if they go to take out the president, whether by physical means or by some kind of legal means.
[01:57:02.382 --> 01:57:03.643]  They're going to be very upset.
[01:57:03.903 --> 01:57:09.327]  They're going to be out in the streets, hopefully peacefully rioting, or excuse me, peacefully protesting.
[01:57:09.687 --> 01:57:14.571]  But it would be very hard for them to be quieted if President Trump is taken out like that.
[01:57:15.313 --> 01:57:24.100]  And also they're trying to bully us with boycotts and don't let libertarian or nationalist or conservative groups have e-commerce or websites.
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:32.127]  It's time for everyone to look at what they're buying, who they're shopping with, and religiously do not spend money with globalist operations.
[01:57:32.688 --> 01:57:33.368]  Break with it.
[01:57:33.869 --> 01:57:34.929]  Go through the extra trouble.
[01:57:35.010 --> 01:57:42.196]  Pay a little more wherever you are to get products you need to not support globalists like Bezos and Amazon.
[01:57:43.158 --> 01:57:51.083]  You know, we got off Amazon a few years ago, even though we were funding ourselves and selling a lot of stuff, because they're just an anti-gun, anti-free speech, anti-American group.
[01:57:51.383 --> 01:57:53.684]  They own the Washington Post, waging war on America.
[01:57:54.225 --> 01:57:55.665]  And, you know, these are enemies.
[01:57:56.146 --> 01:57:57.326]  These are absolute enemies.
[01:57:57.707 --> 01:58:02.009]  But again, pull your money and support from the enemy, and financially support the Liberty Movement.
[01:58:02.289 --> 01:58:04.851]  If we do that as the producers, we will break the enemies back.
[01:58:07.876 --> 01:58:08.497]  Exactly, Alex.
[01:58:08.517 --> 01:58:10.801]  You've got to go to their sources of money.
[01:58:10.841 --> 01:58:13.345]  You've got to go to where their pockets come from.
[01:58:13.565 --> 01:58:14.807]  You know, people say this all the time.
[01:58:14.827 --> 01:58:16.049]  Oh, I've just got a Twitter account.
[01:58:16.069 --> 01:58:16.770]  I've got a Facebook.
[01:58:16.810 --> 01:58:17.371]  What can I do?
[01:58:17.831 --> 01:58:18.773]  We're up against
[01:58:19.298 --> 01:58:20.859]  Billionaires in this thing.
[01:58:21.199 --> 01:58:23.661]  They're putting so many dollars behind this.
[01:58:23.881 --> 01:58:25.862]  They have so many resources at their command.
[01:58:26.503 --> 01:58:28.424]  What they don't have are people.
[01:58:28.664 --> 01:58:31.926]  We have the people on our side, and we have the truth on our side.
[01:58:32.226 --> 01:58:38.951]  And with that ability, with that framework in place, no matter what they throw at us, we are always going to... That's right.
[01:58:38.991 --> 01:58:41.132]  As long as you stay focused and in the fight.
[01:58:41.372 --> 01:58:42.073]  Absolutely.
[01:58:42.113 --> 01:58:43.494]  Jack Posobiec, amazing.
[01:58:44.514 --> 01:58:45.055]  It's the truth.
[01:58:45.735 --> 01:58:47.217]  You are engaging the globalists.
[01:58:47.277 --> 01:58:47.657]  You!
[01:58:48.378 --> 01:58:49.479]  Whether you like it or not.
[01:58:50.019 --> 01:58:50.840]  But it's not work.
[01:58:50.860 --> 01:58:52.361]  Do you feel the electricity?
[01:58:53.102 --> 01:58:59.969]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[01:59:00.269 --> 01:59:04.453]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken.
[01:59:04.873 --> 01:59:09.958]  And it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[01:59:10.038 --> 01:59:13.000]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:14.481]  It's Brain Force Plus.

[01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:25.110]  After four years of research,
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:29.462]  The next big game changer has arrived.
[01:59:30.243 --> 01:59:33.625]  Z-Shield, toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[01:59:34.286 --> 01:59:35.607]  It's made in the USA.
[01:59:36.127 --> 01:59:44.413]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWar.
[01:59:44.873 --> 01:59:46.795]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:59:47.075 --> 01:59:48.056]  We're changing the world.
[01:59:48.516 --> 01:59:52.199]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:55.481 --> 02:00:01.446]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:13.717 --> 02:00:19.882]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.256 --> 02:00:29.678]  Roger Stone's coming up with a lot of breaking news.
[02:00:29.798 --> 02:00:43.286]  I will air large excerpts that really are not getting any coverage of this amazing Rich Higgins who got fired last week, breaking down how globalist Islam is the future world system they're bringing in.
[02:00:44.587 --> 02:00:46.008]  It's just, it's irrefutable.
[02:00:46.048 --> 02:00:47.689]  McMaster is an acolyte of it.
[02:00:47.769 --> 02:00:49.050]  It's a cult of these people.
[02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:50.951]  These are such double-crossers.
[02:00:51.391 --> 02:00:53.693]  Napoleon joined Islam there at the end as well.
[02:00:55.199 --> 02:00:56.520]  Hitler basically merged with it.
[02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:59.902]  This has been done before, but now the demographics are very, very clear.
[02:01:00.663 --> 02:01:01.723]  So that's all coming up.
[02:01:02.644 --> 02:01:05.266]  You know, there's a sad story up on Infowars.com.
[02:01:05.286 --> 02:01:07.287]  It's a positive story, but also a sad story.
[02:01:07.787 --> 02:01:11.830]  Anti-gun activists face bankruptcy after filing a frivolous lawsuit.
[02:01:12.490 --> 02:01:15.492]  Now, the good news is their fake lawsuits are getting shot down around the country.
[02:01:15.953 --> 02:01:23.858]  The sad thing is, is these people got tricked by Bloomberg to be part of the lawsuit themselves, and then they get hit with the court fees.
[02:01:25.171 --> 02:01:29.254]  Very sad to see Bloomberg manipulating people that have been hurt.
[02:01:29.774 --> 02:01:38.161]  You know, they lost some family in the Aurora shooting and I didn't even know who they were when they confronted me on the street in San Antonio at a pro gun rally I was having.
[02:01:38.181 --> 02:01:41.503]  The media tried to spit it that I was being mean to them.
[02:01:41.523 --> 02:01:43.345]  I mean, he hit his wife in front of me.
[02:01:43.825 --> 02:01:47.968]  It's on camera, hit her and was threatening me and just totally out of control.
[02:01:48.468 --> 02:01:51.931]  And then later I found out who they were and tried to stay away.
[02:01:51.991 --> 02:01:54.433]  But they came into the event I was at.
[02:01:55.988 --> 02:02:01.934]  at a restaurant and they were having another event and they thought like I was there to harass them and they just ran over and got in my face.
[02:02:02.234 --> 02:02:11.103]  It's all on video but the anti-gun activists who once confronted Alex Jones are now facing bankruptcy after a judge dismissed their frivolous lawsuit against a gun store.
[02:02:12.406 --> 02:02:28.056]  Lonnie and Sandy Phillips, who faced off with Jones in the 2013 Second Amendment rally in San Antonio, were ordered to pay $200,000 in legal fees to the Lucky Gunner store after a judge threw out their politically motivated lawsuits, which conflicted with federal law.
[02:02:30.114 --> 02:02:34.896]  So again, these Bloomberg push suits are bad news.
[02:02:35.196 --> 02:02:52.164]  The couple were encouraged by the Brady campaign to file a lawsuit against Lucky Gunner, which apparently sold ammunition to the Aurora shooter, James Holmes, who later killed Sandy's daughter, despite the fact that under federal law, business cannot be responsible for the criminal acts of third parties beyond their control if they follow the law.
[02:02:52.624 --> 02:02:56.286]  Lucky Gunner was no more responsible for the actions of James Holmes and
[02:02:57.386 --> 02:03:06.154]  Honda was for the actions of Abdul Razik Ali Artan when he attempted to use his Civic to kill pedestrians at Ohio State University.
[02:03:06.454 --> 02:03:07.355]  This is what the court wrote.
[02:03:07.815 --> 02:03:09.056]  The example I always use.
[02:03:10.257 --> 02:03:22.928]  As is no more deserves punishment, reported the National Review, citing a 2005 Protection of Law Commerce and Arms Act, there are already consumer protections that make gun manufacturers liable in rare cases when their products malfunction.
[02:03:23.508 --> 02:03:25.430]  Naturally, they do not apply to misuse.
[02:03:25.990 --> 02:03:34.393]  The judge simply followed the law by dismissing the lawsuit and now the felons must reimburse the gun store for having to defend against a suit which never should have been filed.
[02:03:34.993 --> 02:03:44.456]  But again, they run all this stuff like they're invincible and we're going to sue you and we're going to get you and that's what I've learned now with frivolous lawsuits that have been filed on us.
[02:03:44.696 --> 02:03:47.137]  Some of the lawyers involved shot their mouths off in D.C.
[02:03:47.177 --> 02:03:47.777]  at some dinners.
[02:03:48.891 --> 02:03:52.213]  And later we called and said, you know, we now know you follow suit that's frivolous.
[02:03:52.734 --> 02:03:54.155]  You just want the suit in the news.
[02:03:54.495 --> 02:03:56.136]  Then behind the scenes, they want to settle.
[02:03:56.756 --> 02:03:57.557]  I won't settle.
[02:03:57.957 --> 02:04:00.979]  Then they pay me, but it's kept quiet.
[02:04:00.999 --> 02:04:01.680]  This is how it works.
[02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:07.764]  They pay me a juicy sum to then settle secretly with them.
[02:04:08.024 --> 02:04:09.125]  Not going to say any names.
[02:04:11.189 --> 02:04:12.671]  But boy, that's how this works.
[02:04:12.711 --> 02:04:18.357]  And then I'm like, okay, so now, next time, I mean, these suits are like out of Cracker Jack boxes, folks.
[02:04:18.457 --> 02:04:26.406]  I mean, they are just, lawyers look at it and go, this is absolutely 100%, this is gonna, they're gonna lose, you're gonna have to pay attorney's fees, they're like, we're certain of it.
[02:04:27.293 --> 02:04:29.375]  Unless maybe you have the 9th Circuit on appeal.
[02:04:29.996 --> 02:04:31.558]  But then the Supreme Court will overrule it.
[02:04:31.778 --> 02:04:33.420]  But they go, that's one chance out of whatever.
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:37.304]  And then they even try to get us in the 9th Circuit.
[02:04:37.384 --> 02:04:39.547]  It is just unbelievable.
[02:04:40.067 --> 02:04:45.673]  But next time, I now realize I have to show the bandits I'm going to fight back.
[02:04:46.394 --> 02:04:50.898]  Counter sue everything so they don't get the PR to then run stories that I'm being sued.
[02:04:50.998 --> 02:04:51.798]  I'm fake news.
[02:04:52.199 --> 02:04:59.124]  So, whoever's next up with their lawsuit, step on up for a big giant litigation with me, PIs, and everything else.
[02:04:59.364 --> 02:05:00.225]  Step right up!
[02:05:00.425 --> 02:05:01.246]  Step right up!
[02:05:03.308 --> 02:05:10.733]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are being sued.
[02:05:14.193 --> 02:05:15.875]  What are they gearing Antifa up?
[02:05:16.195 --> 02:05:20.959]  Why has Soros doubled the amount of money since Trump was elected in January, since he did previously?
[02:05:21.439 --> 02:05:22.580]  What are they gearing up for?
[02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:23.641]  They're calling for violence.
[02:05:23.661 --> 02:05:24.722]  They're calling for Trump's death.
[02:05:25.102 --> 02:05:26.623]  They're calling for it in mainstream news.
[02:05:27.659 --> 02:05:32.680]  They're calling, whether it's Al Gore or whether it's Clapper and Brennan.
[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:34.480]  They're saying something big's about to happen.
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:35.641]  It's not impeachment.
[02:05:35.661 --> 02:05:36.661]  We're going to remove him.
[02:05:36.981 --> 02:05:40.282]  We've got to bipartisanly come together for his removal.
[02:05:40.402 --> 02:05:42.182]  Don't do anything when we remove him.
[02:05:42.722 --> 02:05:44.782]  Suddenly Republican leadership is turning against Trump.
[02:05:45.403 --> 02:05:52.184]  As they raise more money than ever raised, as the Democratic Party is being made extinct, they prepare for the killer blow.
[02:05:52.944 --> 02:05:55.325]  And James Leslie Rawls is our expert to break this down.
[02:05:55.726 --> 02:05:56.886]  Survivalblog.com.
[02:05:56.946 --> 02:06:01.389]  James, this ties into your big lengthy investigative reports.
[02:06:02.249 --> 02:06:05.211]  Antifa Part 1 and 2, the Antifa threat spiral.
[02:06:05.511 --> 02:06:06.491]  Break it down for us.
[02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:08.373]  What are the globalists getting ready to do?
[02:06:09.973 --> 02:06:19.879]  Well Alex, I think it's pretty clear that the Antifa movement is being used as kind of a shock troops for
[02:06:20.846 --> 02:06:23.949]  They're their goal of destabilizing the government.
[02:06:24.369 --> 02:06:33.818]  They want to have a wave of protests and a followed by a wave of domestic terrorism in this country.
[02:06:34.499 --> 02:06:35.840]  They want to destabilize.
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:40.925]  They want to try to create a counter
[02:06:41.705 --> 02:06:59.671]  Action by the Trump administration, they're hoping for a Kent State type event, where it would demoralize the American populace, turn the populace against the Trump administration, and part of their overall campaign to get Trump out of office.
[02:07:01.812 --> 02:07:07.194]  And I think that if you look at Antifa, how they were set up,
[02:07:08.147 --> 02:07:12.668]  How they interact between their cells.
[02:07:13.348 --> 02:07:21.691]  It's very similar to what we saw in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the radicalization of the anti-war movement.
[02:07:22.771 --> 02:07:28.672]  And that spun off a number of incredibly radical terrorist groups.
[02:07:29.293 --> 02:07:30.693]  A lot of them were cellular.
[02:07:32.087 --> 02:07:45.635]  There was some interaction between cells and in fact there was some interaction internationally with groups like the PLO and the Red Army Faction in Germany, the Italian Red Brigades and so forth.
[02:07:46.376 --> 02:07:51.439]  I think we're going to see a very similar era here in the United States in the very near future.
[02:08:11.261 --> 02:08:17.545]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:32.173 --> 02:08:33.534]  I tend to start gibbering.
[02:08:34.847 --> 02:08:42.231]  A hundred miles an hour with all this news and not really just pull back and look at the massive import of what we're facing.
[02:08:43.092 --> 02:08:46.994]  Our country had been hijacked by foreign multinational corporations.
[02:08:48.054 --> 02:08:53.538]  They are openly trying to atomize culture where people are leaderless, dumbed down and easily controlled.
[02:08:54.378 --> 02:09:00.801]  They're so arrogant they write countless public policy reports in white papers admitting they're criminal.
[02:09:01.221 --> 02:09:06.223]  It's in the WikiLeaks how they want to make us poor, control our lives, dumb us down.
[02:09:07.603 --> 02:09:16.847]  They are engaged in just so much bizarre garbage that it makes your head spin.
[02:09:22.898 --> 02:09:35.166]  We're just living in such an amazing time in human culture that I don't even know what to say anymore.
[02:09:35.787 --> 02:09:44.313]  And it's just information overload where I've just got stack after stack after stack of the most incredible stories that all
[02:09:45.489 --> 02:10:02.743]  Just detail the lawless, lying, criminal behavior of these people and the fact that they've converted so much of the culture and so much of the society over into this system.
[02:10:04.104 --> 02:10:07.307]  But what you gotta know is the globalists are predatory.
[02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:15.073]  The globalists know full well what they're doing
[02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:18.801]  And they have a cold-blooded plan.
[02:10:19.361 --> 02:10:24.122]  And they think those of us that aren't sociopaths aren't psychopaths.
[02:10:24.862 --> 02:10:32.925]  Like there's something wrong with us because we don't see that we should dumb people down and we should be predatory and we should control populations.
[02:10:36.546 --> 02:10:38.866]  They think there's something wrong with us that we don't join them.
[02:10:39.106 --> 02:10:44.908]  But every time the sociopaths get in control, societies end up collapsing and degenerating.
[02:10:47.332 --> 02:11:06.789]  Now, Roger Stone's coming up in a little while, but first, because I mentioned this, I wanted to play some clips of Rich Higgins describing what's happening inside DC.
[02:11:08.556 --> 02:11:12.358]  and the struggle in political warfare in America.
[02:11:12.938 --> 02:11:21.741]  Then we're going to play his description of PC culture inside Washington, which is total social control, so you can't fight back against the groups taking over.
[02:11:23.082 --> 02:11:26.483]  Rich Higgins talks about the true repercussions of the terror attacks.
[02:11:27.464 --> 02:11:32.826]  He talks about so much more.
[02:11:33.626 --> 02:11:34.667]  So these are some key clips.
[02:11:34.687 --> 02:11:35.587]  I want to play the first one.
[02:11:36.007 --> 02:11:37.408]  Rich Higgins, formerly the Pentagon,
[02:11:39.847 --> 02:11:53.357]  High-level National Security Advisor to the President, fired for penning a memo about globalism, allied with radical Islam, and using the terror attacks as a way to get us to politically submit to Islam.
[02:11:54.278 --> 02:12:05.766]  And then to direct wars against radical Islam's foes, secular countries like Syria, like Iraq, and of course,
[02:12:06.980 --> 02:12:11.063]  Like Libya, and Egypt, and then putting things a hundred times worse in.
[02:12:11.423 --> 02:12:12.364]  This is the plan.
[02:12:12.604 --> 02:12:20.989]  Then turn that Islamic force against Europe, bring it in, and then have Europe get rid of free speech in the name of submitting, you know, to Islam so they stop killing us.
[02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:30.075]  Because you can say, you know, the terror attack, still statistically more people drown, more people are shot, okay, a lot of Muslims are killing us, what's the big deal?
[02:12:31.576 --> 02:12:32.717]  The violent response
[02:12:34.042 --> 02:12:41.104]  He's the cover for the political operations that are going on, and he points that out, not letting you have pork in schools.
[02:12:42.205 --> 02:12:44.005]  You can argue, well, pork's not healthy, so what?
[02:12:44.405 --> 02:12:46.306]  It's not that, it's that they call the shots.
[02:12:46.366 --> 02:12:47.426]  Who made them God?
[02:12:47.866 --> 02:12:52.308]  Okay, no pork in the school lunches in Australia and Europe and areas here.
[02:12:52.628 --> 02:12:56.529]  Okay, now you can't build synagogues because the Muslims are protesting it.
[02:12:57.430 --> 02:13:01.111]  Since when did you get in that position in Europe and in Australia and other areas?
[02:13:02.205 --> 02:13:04.247]  It's like they're the protected special group.
[02:13:05.729 --> 02:13:06.970]  That's why this is so important.
[02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:09.032]  So here's the first clip of Rich Higgins.
[02:13:09.413 --> 02:13:11.435]  There's only one interview with this guy from Daily Caller.
[02:13:11.455 --> 02:13:12.476]  We're playing parts of it.
[02:13:12.996 --> 02:13:14.017]  With credit here, obviously.
[02:13:14.037 --> 02:13:17.601]  We're going to get him on the next few weeks as soon as he's done with his wedding he's having.
[02:13:18.082 --> 02:13:19.703]  But let's go ahead and go to Rich Higgins.
[02:13:19.723 --> 02:13:20.044]  Here it is.
[02:13:21.761 --> 02:13:29.603]  The day of the Orlando attacks at the Pulse nightclub, my sister-in-law, who's from Florida originally, called me up.
[02:13:30.023 --> 02:13:32.964]  She had friends who had hung out there in years previously.
[02:13:33.604 --> 02:13:40.306]  And for the second time, she now lives in Boston, for the second time she had been touched by terrorism directly.
[02:13:41.307 --> 02:13:41.747]  We're good to go.
[02:14:00.382 --> 02:14:16.893]  I recognize that I do have a unique vantage point from the positions I've occupied in the past and my skill baseline to go forward and hopefully provide for the public and really our policy makers and our politicians an alternative approach.
[02:14:17.694 --> 02:14:22.518]  So why are you coming forward now to talk about this, and why do you care?
[02:14:23.339 --> 02:14:27.282]  2016, from the enemy's strategic vantage point, is a pivot year.
[02:14:28.804 --> 02:14:40.714]  What we've seen in San Bernardino and Orlando, just this morning the statistics, in 2016, 1,200 people have been killed outside of Iraq and Syria by operations ISIS is conducting.
[02:14:41.354 --> 02:14:46.879]  We're going to continue to see the growth in their kinetic attacks.
[02:14:47.759 --> 02:14:53.744]  And I think our fixation on the kinetic attacks draws us away from the strategic perspective we actually have to this.
[02:14:54.184 --> 02:14:59.168]  Understanding there's a political apparatus behind what's actually transpiring in the world.
[02:15:00.532 --> 02:15:12.203]  Because of the death, because of the carnage, because of the media coverage associated with it, it draws us to fixate on particular points that may or may not lead us to the correct strategic conclusions.
[02:15:13.303 --> 02:15:29.148]  And I think it's really important to come forward with folks who understand political warfare, who understand the impetus behind these attacks, the ideological drivers, the political drivers, the social drivers, to aptly formulate policy solutions and strategy solutions.
[02:15:30.448 --> 02:15:35.750]  Where we've lost this war is where we've failed to actually develop a strategy.
[02:15:36.210 --> 02:15:38.271]  And I think 15 years into the war,
[02:15:39.173 --> 02:15:43.795]  With the political space created by the election, it's time to at least have the discussion.
[02:15:44.315 --> 02:15:47.637]  To take that operational pause and re-look at what we're doing.
[02:15:47.697 --> 02:15:50.378]  Because what we have been doing is just not working.
[02:15:50.618 --> 02:15:55.721]  Political warfare is non-violent and violent actions operating in synthesis.
[02:15:56.421 --> 02:16:00.143]  So the terror attack is done for the purpose of making you afraid.
[02:16:00.843 --> 02:16:02.804]  And when you are afraid, you are controlled.
[02:16:03.104 --> 02:16:04.185]  You can be controlled.
[02:16:04.485 --> 02:16:06.065]  You're willing to give away your own freedoms.
[02:16:06.085 --> 02:16:07.446]  You're willing to give away your own rights.
[02:16:07.826 --> 02:16:16.510]  And so, political warfare has to be understood and the goal of the attack in Orlando was not the death of those Americans.
[02:16:17.532 --> 02:16:18.753]  Or the wounding of those Americans.
[02:16:19.474 --> 02:16:25.979]  The goal of the attack on Orlando is to put fear into Americans so that you would be willing to give up some of your rights.
[02:16:26.039 --> 02:16:29.502]  So that you might be able to accept limits on free speech.
[02:16:29.562 --> 02:16:31.463]  So that you might be willing to limit guns.
[02:16:32.604 --> 02:16:36.367]  Again, it's not by accident that those things are targeted.
[02:16:37.068 --> 02:16:41.932]  The left again enabling, I see the left is almost enabling the enemy in these situations.
[02:16:42.993 --> 02:16:46.515]  But they had the secondary purpose there of the political protection.
[02:16:47.456 --> 02:16:50.821]  Not everything in the war on terrorism is kinetic.
[02:16:52.484 --> 02:16:53.425]  We fixate.
[02:16:53.606 --> 02:16:54.387]  We Westerners.
[02:16:54.467 --> 02:16:59.234]  I think it has something to do with our affinity for guns and Westerns.
[02:17:00.095 --> 02:17:02.138]  We appreciate that culturally.
[02:17:02.999 --> 02:17:12.809]  So when we think about the enemy in the war on terrorism, we think about the guy carrying the AK-47 or we thinking about the guy carrying the suicide bomber vest.
[02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:24.239]  We don't think about the subversive who is working at a school that is revising texts or curriculum informing future U.S.
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:25.420]  government leaders.
[02:17:26.281 --> 02:17:33.903]  And it's getting people to understand this threat at the ideological and political level that has been the greatest challenge, I believe, in the war.
[02:17:34.923 --> 02:17:38.163]  And see, the Pentagon now understands what the globalists are doing.
[02:17:38.724 --> 02:17:50.126]  They bring in radical Muslims, they let them attack, then the police state comes in and takes the general public's rights, but accelerates bringing more Muslims in and says, we have to change so they don't attack us anymore.
[02:17:52.162 --> 02:17:56.579]  And that's the one-two punch, and that's what the EU has officially done, betraying Europe.
[02:17:58.206 --> 02:18:10.235]  Advertising open borders, advertising free welfare, giving preferential treatment to the illegal migrants, and then creating this sad story about, oh, they're mainly children when 80-plus percent are military-age men.
[02:18:10.475 --> 02:18:13.777]  There's powerful video of North Africans pouring into Europe.
[02:18:14.277 --> 02:18:15.878]  You don't see any women, any children.
[02:18:15.939 --> 02:18:19.741]  It's wild footage on Infowars.com right now.
[02:18:20.462 --> 02:18:21.723]  It's over-the-top footage.
[02:18:22.734 --> 02:18:36.311]  Joining us is Roger Stone with breaking news on the isolation of the president, the open push for coup d'etat, the launch of his own media system called Real News that has the media freaking out.
[02:18:36.631 --> 02:18:37.212]  Roger Stone.
[02:18:38.772 --> 02:18:40.212]  Alex, great to be with you.
[02:18:40.232 --> 02:18:54.896]  You know, I'm still trying to digest everything we talked about last week, but I am convinced that the three generals who now are in the top circle around the president are seeking to isolate him totally.
[02:18:55.976 --> 02:19:02.298]  It's kind of a death march to walk him towards the ultimate execution by Robert Mueller.
[02:19:02.998 --> 02:19:20.351]  The president is, you know, is probably relieved that the chaos that existed under Reince Priebus of the Oval Office being an open door, kind of like the Marx Brothers stateroom scene, I can understand why the president would be relieved.
[02:19:20.411 --> 02:19:27.717]  But now we are at a juncture where they seek to cut off old friends, political allies, friends from business.
[02:19:28.297 --> 02:19:35.161]  Friends from the world of finance, friends from the president's past, and people that he talks to.
[02:19:35.961 --> 02:19:39.783]  They are really seeking to tighten the cordon.
[02:19:40.223 --> 02:19:49.368]  And by the way, after you reported this last Friday, Kelly was in the news that evening saying, I control everyone that gets to see him, even his family.
[02:19:49.889 --> 02:19:55.832]  Let's discuss what this isolation means straight ahead, because if they bring Trump down, folks, they're going after everybody.
[02:19:56.373 --> 02:19:58.800]  Understand, they know we're winning culturally.
[02:19:59.101 --> 02:20:00.706]  They want to bring in authoritarianism.
[02:20:00.967 --> 02:20:02.853]  Let's talk about how we stop them straight ahead.
[02:20:10.410 --> 02:20:14.491]  Jones is a charismatic performer who gets charged up on a regular basis.
[02:20:14.551 --> 02:20:15.472]  They call that crazy.
[02:20:15.492 --> 02:20:16.332]  That's not crazy.
[02:20:16.552 --> 02:20:20.393]  That's my will, my human spirit saying crush those that would hurt the innocent.
[02:20:20.573 --> 02:20:21.674]  Go after the enemy.
[02:20:22.094 --> 02:20:23.254]  Build a civilization.
[02:20:23.314 --> 02:20:24.034]  Be honorable.
[02:20:24.714 --> 02:20:26.135]  Crush the snakes under your feet.
[02:20:26.355 --> 02:20:27.995]  People want legitimacy.
[02:20:28.056 --> 02:20:29.076]  They want real.
[02:20:30.111 --> 02:20:38.257]  Two-thirds of his funding reportedly comes from selling his products, which he sells on his site under his Infowars Life brand.
[02:20:38.477 --> 02:20:41.499]  Particularly, vitamins and nutraceuticals.
[02:20:41.839 --> 02:20:42.800]  A whole bunch!
[02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:45.181]  Now, let me break them down for you.
[02:20:45.261 --> 02:20:56.749]  There is a Super Male Vitality, a Super Female Vitality, Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee, Lung Cleanse, Brain Force Plus, something called DNA Force that costs $120 a bottle,
[02:20:58.590 --> 02:21:05.856]  And Child Ease, a herbal blend which, according to InfoWars, is designed to soothe the mind and bodies of children.
[02:21:06.616 --> 02:21:17.585]  And then there is Caveman True Paleo Formula with Bone Broth, a chocolate-flavoured drink mix made from bee pollen, stevia and the dust of chicken skeletons.
[02:21:18.225 --> 02:21:24.230]  Now, according to InfoWars, it is one of the most popular new health trends in the world today.
[02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:27.252]  And if you have never gone shopping on InfoWars,
[02:21:27.572 --> 02:21:39.997]  You are in for a treat, because there's the kind of survival gear that you would expect, alongside more surprising items like organic shampoo, body wash, and deodorants, as well as products like Combat One Tactical Bath Wipes.
[02:21:40.557 --> 02:21:45.339]  He does have a medical expert who consults on many of his supplements, Dr. Edward Groot III.
[02:21:45.359 --> 02:21:47.680]  Because the media makes fun of you and says that you're an idiot.
[02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:52.322]  He looks like a fifth-year senior at the University of Falling-Off-a-Surfboard.
[02:21:53.536 --> 02:21:53.956]  That's right.
[02:21:53.976 --> 02:21:56.137]  I mean, literally, they say we cannot sell coffee.
[02:21:56.197 --> 02:21:56.697]  It's a fraud.
[02:21:57.218 --> 02:21:58.058]  Wake up, America.
[02:21:58.138 --> 02:21:59.279]  Patriot blends coffee.
[02:21:59.599 --> 02:22:00.719]  Maybe you've had macne before.
[02:22:00.739 --> 02:22:02.020]  Maybe you've had nerves that were cut off.
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:03.981]  This creates tingling.
[02:22:04.001 --> 02:22:05.762]  A lot of people have their feeling come back.
[02:22:05.782 --> 02:22:06.802]  I'm not going to make claims.
[02:22:07.122 --> 02:22:08.063]  This research is true.
[02:22:09.023 --> 02:22:10.624]  Organically based bio PQQ.
[02:22:10.924 --> 02:22:13.165]  And you can only find its ingredients in comets.
[02:22:14.065 --> 02:22:15.126]  Oh, and blueberries.
[02:22:20.531 --> 02:22:23.252]  His products are different than the ones you can find in stores.
[02:22:23.412 --> 02:22:27.373]  It is absolutely in the crystalline form, the strongest, you absorb it.
[02:22:27.853 --> 02:22:32.235]  So, folks, don't go out to the store and get iodine and say, one of the big chains, it'll kill you.
[02:22:32.915 --> 02:22:33.095]  Wow!
[02:22:33.755 --> 02:22:34.275]  Wow!
[02:22:35.016 --> 02:22:38.737]  I honestly did not know that you could imply your competition kills people.
[02:22:39.917 --> 02:22:44.879]  We sell five different brands of the very best water filtration systems out there.
[02:22:44.919 --> 02:22:45.619]  They're amazing.
[02:22:45.639 --> 02:22:50.681]  They cut out 99.99% of the glyphosate, the herbicides, the pesticides, the fluoride.
[02:22:50.822 --> 02:22:54.443]  Jones is talking about the globalists systematically feminizing us.
[02:22:54.603 --> 02:22:59.125]  Chemicals were being placed in the water to feminize society and reduce the population.
[02:22:59.205 --> 02:23:02.286]  His products are marked up just enough to keep his business going.
[02:23:02.626 --> 02:23:04.607]  Well, the money that's made is pretty much put back into things.
[02:23:05.047 --> 02:23:11.652]  In fact, as he frequently tells his audience, he needs them to buy more to keep his truth-telling crusade solvent and growing.
[02:23:12.412 --> 02:23:15.534]  We need to fund ourselves, and we fund ourselves by you buying the products.
[02:23:15.554 --> 02:23:19.777]  We're at a shortfall now because of the massive sustained economic attacks we're under.
[02:23:19.997 --> 02:23:21.819]  I could have sponsors every segment.
[02:23:21.939 --> 02:23:22.460]  I don't do it.
[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:24.022]  I plug enough to fund things.
[02:23:24.042 --> 02:23:30.208]  He even has a link on the InfoWall store where you can just give him money to help fund the fight against tyranny.
[02:23:30.268 --> 02:23:35.614]  And contributors have left comments like, $25 may not be much, but I know every little bit helps.
[02:23:36.295 --> 02:23:36.695]  Exactly!
[02:23:37.136 --> 02:23:40.479]  It's like an NPR pledge drive for people who hate NPR.
[02:23:41.420 --> 02:23:43.882]  Why not pick up a Bill Clinton rape whistle?
[02:23:43.942 --> 02:23:50.067]  Which, according to InfoWars, should be used to let Bill know you're in the crowd and that you know the truth.
[02:23:51.328 --> 02:23:57.634]  That truth, by the way... Nobody can dispute the fact... That you're a creep!
[02:23:57.674 --> 02:24:03.219]  That we... And by the way, our order came with a free 9-11-wasn't-inside-job bumper sticker.
[02:24:06.210 --> 02:24:09.412]  Ladies and gentlemen we've got big breaking news.
[02:24:09.592 --> 02:24:18.477]  I know last week the DOJ said they were looking at releasing emails that they had said did not previously exist under Loretta Lynch's tenure.
[02:24:18.517 --> 02:24:20.798]  Remember she said there's no emails between me and the Clintons.
[02:24:21.478 --> 02:24:22.739]  No discussions of anything.
[02:24:23.199 --> 02:24:25.120]  I've never talked to the Clintons on email.
[02:24:26.441 --> 02:24:28.302]  Never talked to the State Department when Hillary was there.
[02:24:29.282 --> 02:24:29.442]  Oh!
[02:24:29.802 --> 02:24:31.383]  DOJ releases 400 plus pages
[02:24:33.573 --> 02:24:38.235]  Of Lynch-Clinton meeting emails, and reportedly that's just the headers!
[02:24:38.615 --> 02:24:40.976]  That's just an index of the emails.
[02:24:41.016 --> 02:24:42.637]  So we're talking thousands of pages.
[02:24:44.237 --> 02:24:47.399]  This is the smoking gun, but they don't... Smoking guns come out every day!
[02:24:47.699 --> 02:24:50.420]  Total lying, total criminality, totally insane.
[02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:52.561]  That's why they're so desperate to get Trump.
[02:24:52.981 --> 02:24:55.522]  Because they know everything they said he's done, they've done.
[02:24:55.542 --> 02:24:58.343]  And you've got Mueller with this giant dragnet.
[02:24:59.791 --> 02:25:01.553]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[02:25:01.593 --> 02:25:02.493]  This is just huge.
[02:25:03.054 --> 02:25:03.674]  Roger Stone.
[02:25:04.735 --> 02:25:08.658]  Well, Alex, I really think the focus now has to be on the generals.
[02:25:09.319 --> 02:25:18.547]  General McMaster has conducted a purge of Trump loyalists inside the NSA.
[02:25:19.587 --> 02:25:27.014]  He has put in charge, as the number two, a woman named Allison Nielsen, whose job at Homeland Security, where she was number two,
[02:25:27.714 --> 02:25:28.494]  We're good to go.
[02:25:48.962 --> 02:25:58.229]  We'll be honored unless all three of them sign off the usurpation of entire civilian authority.
[02:25:59.430 --> 02:26:08.337]  And I don't believe that the statement the president put out has been seen correctly and in the right light.
[02:26:09.237 --> 02:26:17.082]  I immediately began to question whether the President had in fact seen the statement, given that he was in New Jersey and that it was issued from New York.
[02:26:17.243 --> 02:26:21.665]  I now know the President was misled into approving a statement.
[02:26:21.725 --> 02:26:28.690]  He was simply told that some have attacked McMasters for being anti-Israel.
[02:26:29.170 --> 02:26:31.252]  And as you know, Mr. President, he loves Israel.
[02:26:31.812 --> 02:26:53.916]  Without mentioning that Mr. McMaster's recently said that Susan Rice had done nothing whatsoever wrong in her unmasking of sensitive surveillance material for political purposes, that's political espionage, and extending her national security clearance.
[02:26:54.376 --> 02:27:00.317]  These were two facts that my sources tell me the President was not aware of when he issued his
[02:27:02.518 --> 02:27:07.922]  So, this is disconcerting.
[02:27:08.082 --> 02:27:10.123]  I say let Trump be Trump.
[02:27:10.923 --> 02:27:22.551]  I say that the idea that he is incontinent or needs a handle is ridiculous, but sources tell me that the president was not happy.
[02:27:23.271 --> 02:27:30.714]  With stories he read that said that General Kelly was seeking to get control of the President's Twitter feed.
[02:27:32.575 --> 02:27:41.219]  The President's Twitter feed is his province, isn't being written by some punk staffer, or some military guy.
[02:27:41.659 --> 02:27:49.583]  This is Donald Trump's lifeline to the American people, and the General, I think, may have made a mistake in his efforts to attempt to close it.
[02:27:50.814 --> 02:28:00.761]  That is powerful information because he was in the news being quoted talking about Trump like he was some mentally retarded kid that you have to keep in the basement.
[02:28:01.882 --> 02:28:03.983]  Very sickening, arrogant statements.
[02:28:04.444 --> 02:28:05.765]  And I wasn't sure Kelly said it.
[02:28:05.805 --> 02:28:11.449]  I mean, CNN lies so much that either Kelly said that or he didn't say it, but regardless,
[02:28:12.620 --> 02:28:21.809]  Implying that the president was being isolated for his own good and saying that he was no longer going to be on his Twitter alone, but would run it past Kelly.
[02:28:22.669 --> 02:28:33.039]  Again, I mean, these people are arrogant, just like McMaster would run around and say, we're going to topple Assad a day after Trump said that we weren't going to topple Assad, and then he had to walk that back later.
[02:28:33.079 --> 02:28:34.941]  These people are like whack-a-mole.
[02:28:34.981 --> 02:28:36.102]  They keep popping up.
[02:28:36.542 --> 02:28:41.489]  Like bad kids just to see if they can score points with the mainstream media.
[02:28:41.569 --> 02:28:44.994]  Who wants to score points with this dying dinosaur edifice?
[02:28:45.902 --> 02:28:59.877]  Well, and let's face it, when Congressman Adam Bull Schiff comes forward to heartily endorse the leadership of Henry McMaster, of, pardon me, of General McMaster, I think that tells us all we need to know.
[02:28:59.957 --> 02:29:01.599]  The globalists stick together.
[02:29:02.159 --> 02:29:08.065]  McMaster is allied with the other two generals for, this is seven days in May.
[02:29:08.746 --> 02:29:22.075]  This is an effort to lull the president to sleep, cut him off from his most loyal supporters, withhold the truth from him about his government, try to deter him from doing any damage before they can take him out.
[02:29:22.856 --> 02:29:30.341]  Take him out, in this case defined as walking him slowly to the gallows that are being constructed by Robert Mueller.
[02:29:31.802 --> 02:29:34.144]  Of course, seven days in May was a Hollywood
[02:29:35.106 --> 02:29:47.777]  Peace, basically, the same year as Dr. Strangelove came out dealing with the same type of out-of-control rogue generals in Deep State starting a nuclear war.
[02:29:48.617 --> 02:29:52.040]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more with Roger Stone.
[02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:52.500]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:52.540 --> 02:29:53.201]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.701 --> 02:29:55.303]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.244 --> 02:29:58.906]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.231 --> 02:30:11.779]  Of the 30 plus proprietary products that we've developed for InfoWarsLife.com, which are all amazing, DNA Force is the flagship.
[02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:20.728]  This highly advanced formula has been sold out for close to six months due to a worldwide shortage of the sought after ingredients.
[02:30:21.068 --> 02:30:38.239]  Today I'm very excited to announce that we have received a limited shipment of DNA Force and despite the fact that we have been sold out for close to six months, I'm still discounting it 20% because I want listeners and viewers that haven't tried DNA Force yet to actually get a chance to see how amazing it is.
[02:30:38.519 --> 02:30:52.245]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systemic enzymes, NaR lipoic acid, BioPQQ, and many, many others that synergistically work together.
[02:30:52.546 --> 02:31:03.231]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com for yourself and read the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of third-party outside reviews that are an average of 4.8 stars for DNA Force.

[02:31:08.493 --> 02:31:18.635]  Nutraceutical with 175 plus studies to back up all the amazing properties, nerve regrowth factor, detoxifying cells, it just goes on and on.

[02:31:57.314 --> 02:32:00.977]  And again, thank you for making the InfoWar possible.
[02:32:01.377 --> 02:32:02.799]  You are the InfoWar.
[02:32:03.179 --> 02:32:05.481]  We have the new products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:07.642 --> 02:32:18.669]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:23.672]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:32:23.792 --> 02:32:27.775]  It helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[02:32:28.075 --> 02:32:30.896]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:32:30.956 --> 02:32:35.697]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:32:35.737 --> 02:32:47.299]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium, so it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:32:47.399 --> 02:32:48.839]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[02:32:49.039 --> 02:32:49.760]  This is so key.
[02:32:50.020 --> 02:32:54.321]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:32:54.341 --> 02:32:56.401]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:32:56.561 --> 02:33:01.805]  Exclusively available at Infowarslive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:33:01.885 --> 02:33:11.132]  Rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:33:12.493 --> 02:33:16.936]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:17.537 --> 02:33:19.038]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.659 --> 02:33:22.481]  Now I don't watch a great deal of Fox.
[02:33:24.292 --> 02:33:31.735]  When I'm on the elliptical in the morning, usually 30 minutes, I'll watch a little bit of that, then I'll listen to music when I'm lifting weights for another 30-45 minutes.
[02:33:32.695 --> 02:33:41.959]  And then we have monitors on basically in five different areas of the office that have CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN, Fox, and we kind of monitor it.
[02:33:42.940 --> 02:33:48.042]  But every time I turn Fox on, if it's not Sean Hannity or Tucker Carlson,
[02:33:49.580 --> 02:33:51.781]  They are just backhanded attacking the president.
[02:33:52.282 --> 02:33:53.022]  Oh, he's lazy.
[02:33:53.042 --> 02:33:54.083]  He didn't get anything done.
[02:33:54.103 --> 02:33:55.423]  Oh, but it doesn't matter.
[02:33:55.443 --> 02:33:57.224]  He just says, you know, he hates the media.
[02:33:57.525 --> 02:33:58.565]  He's a one-trick pony.
[02:33:58.605 --> 02:33:59.986]  Ha ha ha.
[02:34:00.086 --> 02:34:00.706]  It's bad.
[02:34:00.927 --> 02:34:03.408]  And you can see the people do not like what they're saying.
[02:34:03.808 --> 02:34:07.991]  They do not like the talking points they've been given because it's suiciding the ratings.
[02:34:08.031 --> 02:34:11.633]  Now, we first reported back in July they were going to get rid of Roger Ailes in a coup.
[02:34:12.173 --> 02:34:15.635]  The brothers were, because they want to sell Sky News for $40-something million.
[02:34:15.855 --> 02:34:22.138]  And in the UK, they won't allow that sale to go through if it's involved in hate anywhere else in the world.
[02:34:22.718 --> 02:34:23.599]  And a bunch of other stuff.
[02:34:23.619 --> 02:34:25.320]  But they've gotten on board.
[02:34:26.140 --> 02:34:27.341]  They think they're going to beat Trump.
[02:34:27.361 --> 02:34:29.082]  They think they're going to beat the nationalism.
[02:34:29.602 --> 02:34:31.363]  They think they're going to beat Make America Great Again.
[02:34:31.383 --> 02:34:35.285]  They think they're going to get their carbon tax and their open borders because they're committed to it.
[02:34:35.985 --> 02:34:38.907]  And they're classically in ivory towers in their own world.
[02:34:39.347 --> 02:34:51.414]  You read Ministry of Defense, Pentagon analysis, others, they say populism is going to take over, renaissance is going to explode back, but then there's going to be big wars because of AI, overpopulation.
[02:34:51.434 --> 02:34:56.617]  There is overpopulation in many areas of the world because we've not allowed clean industry to come in.
[02:34:56.737 --> 02:35:01.340]  Currently we're overpopulated in the many areas and it's just going to be a just an absolute bloodbath.
[02:35:02.170 --> 02:35:12.053]  So we're going to defeat modern globalism and the plan of David Rockefeller and the UN and their family and this corporate idea to loot everybody, but we're still left with a bunch of problems.
[02:35:12.093 --> 02:35:13.733]  It's not like we're offering some utopia.
[02:35:14.614 --> 02:35:17.454]  And so Roger Stone is our guest.
[02:35:17.534 --> 02:35:25.937]  He brought a clip to my attention of this pundit on Fox News saying, oh, well, Kelly's real measure will be, can he stop
[02:35:27.589 --> 02:35:29.632]  Alex Jones' information from getting the president.
[02:35:29.652 --> 02:35:36.880]  Because see, they've gone from, oh, look, the president's crazy, he gets Alex Jones' info, to trying to ignore that and just hope it goes away.
[02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:38.462]  Well, let me explain something.
[02:35:38.482 --> 02:35:43.227]  The only reason the president's listened to me on occasion is common sense.
[02:35:44.929 --> 02:35:47.973]  Before he was president, they just stole the nomination from
[02:35:49.704 --> 02:35:52.306]  Bernie Sanders, even though he won all those states, they're going to steal it from you.
[02:35:52.366 --> 02:36:01.352]  And there's some memos that have been put out by the Democrats that are talking about wanting to federalize elections to stop the Republicans from ever, you know, becoming the dominant party.
[02:36:01.672 --> 02:36:04.534]  And then you give people the info, the Democrats are talking about it.
[02:36:05.015 --> 02:36:11.860]  Obviously Trump listened, went and checked the numbers of 3 point whatever million illegals voting in the last election.
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:13.261]  He brought all that out.
[02:36:13.321 --> 02:36:14.642]  It's all been proven correct.
[02:36:15.422 --> 02:36:26.925]  So that's what they can't stand, is the fact that I communicate with the President through you, communicating with him on Twitter, through you at the rallies, through people close to the President, and I'll just leave it that way.
[02:36:27.927 --> 02:36:43.561]  They can't stand it, and they want Hannity off just because, more than anybody, one hour a night, if he's not giving a speech or whatever, or he has them DVR it, when he gets back at midnight, he gets out the popcorn and turns on Sean Hannity.
[02:36:44.141 --> 02:36:45.823]  Major bromance going on forever.
[02:36:47.694 --> 02:36:52.841]  Kennedy's talking about all the coup and murder the president and foe and because the globalists are saying it.
[02:36:52.901 --> 02:37:05.097]  So they want to prepare their coup, talk about 25th Amendment, talk about killing him, talk about blowing up the White House, and then not have us talk about it on forums that get to the president so they can organize all their people and normalize it.
[02:37:06.018 --> 02:37:13.024]  But then separately, they don't want us warning the President, oh hey, five times this week, Clapper says he wants you to be overthrown.
[02:37:13.624 --> 02:37:15.466]  Oh look, you know, on and on and on.
[02:37:15.566 --> 02:37:19.249]  Oh, Al Gore just bragged on the Late Late Show that you're about to be overthrown.
[02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:26.395]  So, that's why they had the Washington Post a month ago saying Hannity has now got into Alex Jones territory.
[02:37:26.635 --> 02:37:27.596]  Look, he's crazy.
[02:37:27.976 --> 02:37:31.640]  He claims there's a plan for COG to overthrow, he got it from Alex.
[02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:34.182]  And then they don't show that it was an Atlantic Monthly.
[02:37:35.242 --> 02:37:37.042]  So, he didn't get it from me.
[02:37:37.663 --> 02:37:38.583]  This is going on.
[02:37:38.683 --> 02:37:40.303]  Lou Dobbs, Rush Limbaugh, all of us.
[02:37:40.623 --> 02:37:41.363]  Yes, it's true.
[02:37:41.763 --> 02:37:44.484]  Has Alex Jones and Roger Stone and all of us trailblazed this?
[02:37:44.584 --> 02:37:44.784]  Yes.
[02:37:45.324 --> 02:37:47.745]  Don't you think we're a little tired of being in the trailblazers?
[02:37:47.765 --> 02:37:48.945]  You know how dangerous this is?
[02:37:48.965 --> 02:37:50.545]  They already tried to kill Roger twice.
[02:37:51.046 --> 02:37:54.006]  I'm not going to get into the stuff going on behind the scenes here, but let me just tell you something.
[02:37:54.366 --> 02:38:00.428]  If I wasn't somebody, I'm not into abuse, but if somebody's going to do it, I can flip a switch and like it.
[02:38:00.748 --> 02:38:01.208]  You understand?
[02:38:02.368 --> 02:38:04.528]  I get my energy off them trying to destroy me.
[02:38:04.548 --> 02:38:05.109]  You understand?
[02:38:05.349 --> 02:38:05.949]  I'm committed.
[02:38:06.349 --> 02:38:07.089]  In fact, I love it.
[02:38:07.189 --> 02:38:07.709]  You understand?
[02:38:07.889 --> 02:38:08.609]  I flip the switch.
[02:38:09.009 --> 02:38:10.890]  So, they need to understand that I love all of it.
[02:38:10.910 --> 02:38:11.990]  I absolutely enjoy it.
[02:38:12.190 --> 02:38:13.230]  I'm not just putting a good face on it.
[02:38:13.470 --> 02:38:13.970]  I love it!
[02:38:14.130 --> 02:38:14.870]  Whatever you do!
[02:38:15.731 --> 02:38:17.291]  Because you're gonna be defeated.
[02:38:17.531 --> 02:38:19.031]  And we're winning the culture war.
[02:38:19.231 --> 02:38:22.352]  And now you can't carry out your little assassination or whatever.
[02:38:22.712 --> 02:38:25.472]  Or hit him with some drugs and claim he had a collapse, a mental issue.
[02:38:25.712 --> 02:38:26.773]  Put him on PCP.
[02:38:27.013 --> 02:38:28.173]  Whatever it is you're planning.
[02:38:28.553 --> 02:38:40.246]  Don't think we don't know and don't think you're ever going to get away with it McMaster and Brennan and all you dirty collaborator Benedict Arnold's that sold us out to radical Islam.
[02:38:40.406 --> 02:38:46.853]  Don't ever, I'm sorry Roger I'm ranting but you brought up this clip I hadn't seen it I watched it during the break and it made me get angry again.
[02:38:47.153 --> 02:38:48.333]  But it shows how weak they are.
[02:38:48.574 --> 02:38:57.977]  If they're afraid of us, and are fighting around the clock desperately to keep our information from getting to the President, it shows what weak crap they are.
[02:38:58.237 --> 02:39:00.718]  Not how strong we are, but how weak they are!
[02:39:02.366 --> 02:39:05.068]  Well, Alex, I think it's a two-pronged strategy.
[02:39:05.588 --> 02:39:21.617]  One is to try to cut off all access to the president so that he doesn't watch InfoWars, doesn't read Breitbart, doesn't see the Daily Caller, isn't watching Town Hall and a dozen of other sites that he did avidly follow during the campaign.
[02:39:22.217 --> 02:39:26.380]  So he's on a steady diet of Fox and CNN and the three networks.
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:40.814]  Fox is probably where he gets most of his information, and if he's watching Judge Jeanine or Sean Hannity or Judge Napolitano or Tucker Carlson or Steve Doocy, he's getting it straight.
[02:39:42.343 --> 02:39:46.688]  Otherwise, you're right, the complexion of Fox is changing quickly.
[02:39:47.088 --> 02:40:01.383]  By limiting the print media that he sees and swiftly curtailing his television viewing so that it does not include alternative media, it's much easier to control his perception of things.
[02:40:02.684 --> 02:40:04.526]  As I've said a hundred times on this program,
[02:40:05.487 --> 02:40:09.889]  When Donald Trump has all the information, he almost invariably makes the right decision.
[02:40:09.909 --> 02:40:11.689]  I think you've said it 200 times, and let me add this.
[02:40:12.249 --> 02:40:13.650]  You've been saying this for months.
[02:40:13.990 --> 02:40:17.031]  Kelly and others have tipped their hat, their hand.
[02:40:17.091 --> 02:40:20.572]  They're on TV saying, we're getting him totally isolated.
[02:40:20.592 --> 02:40:24.033]  Now some people say, well that's the leaks, so they can find who the leakers are.
[02:40:24.073 --> 02:40:25.714]  Maybe Kelly's good, maybe he is.
[02:40:26.534 --> 02:40:28.175]  All I know is McMaster's bad.
[02:40:28.335 --> 02:40:29.816]  Mattis, I don't know what's going on.
[02:40:30.517 --> 02:40:32.658]  And we're going to see if the leaks stop.
[02:40:32.698 --> 02:40:33.939]  That shows Kelly's good.
[02:40:35.199 --> 02:40:36.980]  Or maybe the media is misquoting Kelly.
[02:40:37.241 --> 02:40:44.485]  Regardless here, regardless, all I'm saying is that it's true he was being spied on.
[02:40:44.605 --> 02:40:46.246]  It's true they're trying to overthrow him.
[02:40:46.506 --> 02:40:47.507]  And he needs to know this.
[02:40:47.547 --> 02:40:48.107]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:40:48.828 --> 02:40:50.269]  Alex, let's be absolutely clear.
[02:40:50.329 --> 02:40:55.372]  When they talk about finding the leakers and closing the leaks, this is folly.
[02:40:56.352 --> 02:40:58.114]  No president has ever been able to do that.
[02:40:58.254 --> 02:41:00.977]  They will run cursory investigations.
[02:41:01.438 --> 02:41:07.264]  They're going to find that the people in government who leak are strategic enough not to use their own cell phones or emails.
[02:41:08.085 --> 02:41:14.691]  They're not going to leave traces that for which in some cases are crimes in which they could be prosecuted.
[02:41:15.192 --> 02:41:18.856]  Then what will happen is the government will start using surveillance and
[02:41:19.356 --> 02:41:23.238]  Eavesdropping to try to catch the leakers before they leak.
[02:41:23.278 --> 02:41:28.200]  And it'll be that surveillance that Deep State actually uses to stir up stuff and twist things to burn POTUS.
[02:41:28.621 --> 02:41:37.065]  Well, or even worse, it is precisely what ended up bringing President Nixon down.
[02:41:37.085 --> 02:41:39.506]  It will now be used to use Trump down.
[02:41:39.566 --> 02:41:41.647]  Oh my God, Trump was surveilling his own staff.
[02:41:41.687 --> 02:41:47.970]  In all honesty, the fact that we even need to put members of the White House staff under surveillance
[02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:51.991]  Tells you that they have had poor hiring practices.
[02:41:53.051 --> 02:41:55.452]  This should be the ultimate team of Trump loyalists.
[02:41:55.972 --> 02:42:05.374]  Instead... But as you said, day one, they put in sheep-dipped, globalist Soros operatives at all the gatekeeping points to put in the fifth column.
[02:42:06.534 --> 02:42:07.235]  It's very sad.
[02:42:07.255 --> 02:42:09.695]  I mean, the president is like a captive in a tower.
[02:42:10.175 --> 02:42:17.017]  His instinct is good, his heart is pure, and when he gives orders on the economy and they're carried out, we see the results.
[02:42:17.597 --> 02:42:45.635]  He's being told things selectively so they can, in my opinion, lull him to sleep about the danger of Mueller and what he has in store, and to try to mute his corporate tax cut back to something meaningless, to stall as long as they can on the wall, and otherwise just run the clock out, hoping that the Democrats take the House in 2018, and then anything Mueller dishes up
[02:42:52.863 --> 02:42:57.108]  Roger, my life is so exciting, is so incredible.
[02:42:57.148 --> 02:42:59.450]  People think being politically aware is like work.
[02:43:00.091 --> 02:43:00.792]  It's addicting.
[02:43:00.812 --> 02:43:03.255]  We're like in a super spy novel that's real.
[02:43:05.106 --> 02:43:17.079]  The evil, corrupt, deep state is as nasty as anyone could imagine against God, against Christ, against Western civilization, and is literally run by a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[02:43:17.620 --> 02:43:22.225]  And we're kicking their butt, our audience is kicking their butt, they're trying to shut us down.
[02:43:23.126 --> 02:43:32.149]  We have this beachhead, but it's like watching your favorite football team at the Super Bowl in sudden-death overtime, and the kicker is about to kick the field goal from 47 yards.
[02:43:32.189 --> 02:43:39.972]  You know, he only makes this 10% of the time, and it's a winless day, so he's got a shot, but it doesn't just go for 10 seconds.
[02:43:40.492 --> 02:43:44.933]  It goes on day after day, week after week of just sudden-death overtime.
[02:43:45.293 --> 02:43:46.254]  They get the advantage.
[02:43:46.314 --> 02:43:47.194]  We get the advantage.
[02:43:47.254 --> 02:43:49.575]  I get chills just constantly now.
[02:43:50.015 --> 02:43:59.601]  Of how epic this is, and how they admit they're trying to isolate him in the news, and everything you've told me is just dead on in other sources.
[02:44:00.742 --> 02:44:05.925]  And to see Trump just with hyenas biting him everywhere, and it's just, it's epic!
[02:44:06.385 --> 02:44:15.947]  And then to see the cowards around him, you know, giving in to the fear and, you know, or people get all hyped up for Madeline Go Too Crazy, which I understand.
[02:44:16.327 --> 02:44:17.127]  That happens to me.
[02:44:17.247 --> 02:44:21.108]  I mean, this is just such a historic time, such an amazing time.
[02:44:21.488 --> 02:44:23.868]  And the American people have to understand, this is real.
[02:44:24.268 --> 02:44:27.449]  Trump isn't perfect, but he really is the real guy, what they always said.
[02:44:27.689 --> 02:44:29.109]  He's really trying to do this.
[02:44:29.209 --> 02:44:34.850]  And they're coming after him and don't want us to warn him that they are organizing an overthrow.
[02:44:35.350 --> 02:44:40.832]  And as you said, Mueller accelerating this grand jury right out of the swamp, right out of the loins of the D.C.
[02:44:40.872 --> 02:44:41.232]  swamp.
[02:44:41.673 --> 02:44:43.633]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[02:44:44.254 --> 02:44:54.718]  Well, and sadly, I must tell you, I am most disappointed in Steve Bannon, who I have defended on this very program, and whose worldview I probably more closely
[02:44:55.878 --> 02:44:58.879]  Uh, adhere to than that of the globalists.
[02:44:59.580 --> 02:45:06.562]  Uh, there have been many occasions in which Steve has not stepped up, but in this case, I think he has thrown his lot in with the generals.
[02:45:07.102 --> 02:45:12.384]  It was, uh, he was the guy who recommended Kelly for Homeland Security, got him inside the fort.
[02:45:12.824 --> 02:45:16.386]  He helped undermine Trump loyalist, Anthony Scaramucci.
[02:45:17.126 --> 02:45:24.629]  Uh, and, uh, he, we know that he called Drudge last week and asked him not to post the stories regarding McMaster.
[02:45:25.489 --> 02:45:33.613]  Defending Susan Rice saying she had done nothing wrong when she was engaged in political, illegal, political espionage.
[02:45:33.693 --> 02:45:34.854]  Wow, that's quite a claim.
[02:45:34.874 --> 02:45:35.574]  I didn't know about that.
[02:45:35.594 --> 02:45:36.775]  I'm not saying you're making this up.
[02:45:37.115 --> 02:45:39.756]  How do you, I mean, you were told that he called drudge last week?
[02:45:40.837 --> 02:45:43.538]  Yes, I have that on very good authority.
[02:45:44.379 --> 02:45:52.663]  I also, so I think it is unfortunate because evidently Brother Bannon does not understand that the deep state will eat him last.
[02:45:53.379 --> 02:46:11.986]  Well let's explain this, let's explain this, because the media spends it all, McMaster, between the Young Turks, CNN, the whole Soros thing, defending him like he's Jesus Christ, returned to earth in the second coming, on a silver platter, the little baby McMaster, the little golden, you know, creature, President McMaster, and then you look at it,
[02:46:13.174 --> 02:46:14.755]  And you pull back from it.
[02:46:15.316 --> 02:46:20.241]  It isn't just that, oh, it's normal to give a former national security advisor a clearance you can talk to them.
[02:46:20.541 --> 02:46:20.741]  No!
[02:46:21.522 --> 02:46:30.930]  He's defending her, saying the illegal spying, saying the unmasking, saying spying on the president, candidate, his family, all of this illegal crap is okay!
[02:46:31.411 --> 02:46:35.735]  He's there literally, publicly, massaging one of the great enemies!
[02:46:37.592 --> 02:46:43.356]  I can tell you definitively right now, Alex, the President has not been told that the U.N.
[02:46:43.416 --> 02:46:53.021]  Ambassador Samantha Powers unmasked dozens of people, according to my sources, although he may have been told that this afternoon.
[02:46:53.902 --> 02:46:58.545]  It's a perfect example of the kind of information the President needs to have, and here is why.
[02:47:00.114 --> 02:47:19.151]  The finding of the FISA court at the end of Obama's term proves definitively and without dispute that the NSA under Barack Obama, working with the FBI, conducted unconstitutional, illegal surveillance of as many as 30,000 people for political reasons.
[02:47:19.311 --> 02:47:24.015]  And this information was later used in some of the unmasking that we speak of.
[02:47:24.475 --> 02:47:34.742]  And Sean Hannity says if it comes out he was being surveilled, they've leaked the evidence that I and Michael Savage and others were, including Trump, including his private number, you know, there at his resort.
[02:47:34.762 --> 02:47:36.042]  I mean, these are real numbers, folks.
[02:47:36.483 --> 02:47:39.485]  So when he threatens the lawsuit of Obama administration, ask him.
[02:47:39.505 --> 02:47:39.745]  Go ahead.
[02:47:40.285 --> 02:47:48.493]  Yeah, and it is absolutely true, Alex, that your phone calls with the president were monitored, or then-candidate were monitored.
[02:47:48.533 --> 02:47:50.955]  My phone calls with him were monitored.
[02:47:51.115 --> 02:47:56.100]  I assume that our phone calls after he became president were monitored.
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:47:57.842]  There's no probable cause here.
[02:47:57.862 --> 02:47:59.723]  You know, I received
[02:48:00.464 --> 02:48:13.072]  This week I got accepted service in the phony lawsuit where Obama is suing me, Obama and the Obamaites, with this fake claim yet again that I somehow colluded with the Russians.
[02:48:13.792 --> 02:48:17.314]  And it's a classic post hoc ergo proctor hoc case.
[02:48:17.334 --> 02:48:21.557]  In other words, because you knew things, that meant you made them happen, or that you did them.
[02:48:21.917 --> 02:48:23.158]  It's a total fallacy.
[02:48:23.478 --> 02:48:31.663]  It's like a compendium of incorrect reports that have been reported into the fake news, pasted up to look like a legal complaint.
[02:48:31.683 --> 02:48:33.324]  They have less than nothing.
[02:48:33.344 --> 02:48:34.305]  It's a vomit jerk.
[02:48:34.325 --> 02:48:38.108]  They all vomit into each other's mouth, and then it goes in circles into perpetuity.
[02:48:38.128 --> 02:48:45.953]  Let's play that clip, because I forgot to play it, from Fox this weekend, talking about Kelly needs to isolate the president from you-know-who.
[02:48:46.833 --> 02:48:58.920]  Master has, I believe, three stars on his shoulder, but his military bearing hasn't protected him from a campaign of vicious leaks coming from people within the White House who regard him as sort of a sellout on foreign policy.
[02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:11.828]  Kelly has to get, that's, he's got his hands on that problem right now, and I think a lot of people inside the staff are looking to see if he can really get control of it, because if he can, well, then I think he'll have established his authority and people will
[02:49:12.228 --> 02:49:12.528]  I love it!
[02:49:12.548 --> 02:49:15.010]  Oh, conspiracy theories, like everything you're doing.
[02:49:15.090 --> 02:49:17.792]  Oh, Mr. President, here's five articles where they're saying they're going to kill you.
[02:49:35.453 --> 02:49:36.894]  Oh, yes, sir.
[02:49:37.315 --> 02:49:39.657]  Here's articles where they're going to federalize the election and steal it from you.
[02:49:39.877 --> 02:49:41.298]  Trump comes out and says, don't federalize it.
[02:49:41.758 --> 02:49:44.080]  And then Obama runs out and says, that's made up by Jones.
[02:49:44.321 --> 02:49:47.924]  Turns out he had the executive order ready and still signed it.
[02:49:48.024 --> 02:49:48.784]  But after.
[02:49:49.825 --> 02:49:51.847]  See, they're pissed because we're exposing them.
[02:49:52.107 --> 02:49:55.790]  And so the litmus test is stop Alex Jones info.
[02:49:56.091 --> 02:49:58.513]  Well, if it's just a bunch of bull, what's the problem, Roger?
[02:49:59.664 --> 02:50:00.565]  Alex, this is funny.
[02:50:00.585 --> 02:50:08.388]  I wonder who they could possibly have been speaking about when they talked about memos containing Alex Jones' conspiracy theories.
[02:50:09.869 --> 02:50:18.032]  You know, look, all hell will break loose the first time Donald Trump finds out something that he should have been told and wasn't, and it has a negative ramification.
[02:50:19.633 --> 02:50:20.914]  I've known him 40 years.
[02:50:20.974 --> 02:50:22.174]  He's a midnight dialer.
[02:50:22.574 --> 02:50:24.535]  Better than Lyndon Johnson when it comes to phones.
[02:50:24.555 --> 02:50:27.657]  And let's say this, as they try to keep him from our information, what's that make him do?
[02:50:28.457 --> 02:50:30.477]  I think it'll make him seek some information.
[02:50:30.577 --> 02:50:41.920]  Don't get me wrong, in the short term, I think he's going to enjoy the additional time that he has on his hands, which is something that Ryan's previous never budgeted into the schedule.
[02:50:42.020 --> 02:50:51.682]  This story in Newsweek that he is not a hard worker, that he sits all day in a Barca lounger eating Cheetos and watching television is a lie.
[02:50:52.622 --> 02:50:54.722]  He's one of the hardest working... Wait a minute!
[02:50:54.762 --> 02:50:55.683]  Newsweek lies?
[02:50:56.443 --> 02:50:56.883]  Come on!
[02:50:57.603 --> 02:50:59.086]  I don't think they ever even told the truth.
[02:50:59.306 --> 02:51:01.008]  They are news fake, or fake week.
[02:51:01.309 --> 02:51:02.050]  Thank you Roger.
[02:51:02.130 --> 02:51:03.372]  We got key stuff coming up folks.
[02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:25.155]  Yes, not only is the left tactically fascist, not only are they using the tactics of the Nazis, but they also have the ideology of the Nazis.
[02:51:25.595 --> 02:51:31.558]  Let's remember that Nazism and Fascism were both variants of Socialism.
[02:51:31.798 --> 02:51:36.980]  The very word Nazi is putting together National and Socialista.
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:38.861]  That's where we get the sound Nazi.
[02:51:39.541 --> 02:51:41.302]  Mussolini was a Marxist.
[02:51:41.462 --> 02:51:44.502]  He was the leader of the Italian Socialist Party.
[02:51:44.983 --> 02:51:47.003]  He was recognized to be on the left.
[02:51:47.103 --> 02:51:48.744]  He saw himself as on the left.
[02:51:49.184 --> 02:51:54.765]  When Mussolini came to power, Lenin sent him a telegram of congratulations.
[02:51:55.185 --> 02:51:55.525]  Why?
[02:51:55.946 --> 02:52:00.827]  Because Lenin recognized that Mussolini was a fellow revolutionary of the left.
[02:52:01.327 --> 02:52:15.436]  So, what an incredible sleight of hand in which these leftists, whose political platform reads like it's right out of the Democratic Party platform... And by the way, Dinesh, this is something... You're absolutely right.
[02:52:15.456 --> 02:52:23.241]  This is something that leftists on universities say that we're lying about, and a real hot point for them because it's a fact the Nazis were National Socialists.
[02:52:23.662 --> 02:52:27.324]  It's a fact that he modeled himself after the fascistas in Italy.
[02:52:27.604 --> 02:52:28.925]  It's a fact they wore black.
[02:52:29.025 --> 02:52:30.326]  It's a fact they wore masks.
[02:52:30.586 --> 02:52:32.188]  It's a fact they beat up their opposition.
[02:52:32.588 --> 02:52:35.831]  It's a fact that Hitler then turned against Stalin.
[02:52:36.772 --> 02:52:43.359]  They admired each other back and forth because he was seen as a rival politically and a rival militarily.
[02:52:43.619 --> 02:52:49.265]  But they had an alliance for the first year of the war where they divided Poland amongst each other.
[02:52:49.365 --> 02:52:51.167]  So we had the Warsaw Pact.
[02:52:51.727 --> 02:53:10.519]  They hope that's not known, that they are authoritarian, and that socialism and fascism have different and left-right versions, and that it was the American left that backed Hitler early on because he was a vegetarian and a bunch of other issues, and he wanted planning of society.
[02:53:10.559 --> 02:53:15.222]  This is incontrovertible that the KKK was founded by the Democratic Party.
[02:53:15.562 --> 02:53:18.084]  It is incontrovertible that the Republicans
[02:53:18.584 --> 02:53:23.127]  ...passed the Civil Rights Act and took, you know, that system away from them and they panic.
[02:53:23.507 --> 02:53:37.457]  It is incontrovertible that the power structure got scared of American Christians and American Republicans and Eisenhower and created this whole new strategy to get everybody to go, oh, you're going to be liberal?
[02:53:37.497 --> 02:53:38.638]  You're going to be anti-racist?
[02:53:39.038 --> 02:53:45.402]  We'll take it over and make it extreme, own it, then double-cross you later and make everything race-based again.
[02:53:46.684 --> 02:53:51.134]  Once whites have been taught to bow down as long as you say something's for racial equality.
[02:53:51.374 --> 02:53:57.007]  So they're using our goodness, our bigness, our Christian Western ethos to then bring us down.
[02:54:10.700 --> 02:54:13.383]  Coming up in the fourth hour, Owen Schroyer is going to be hosting.
[02:54:13.403 --> 02:54:14.845]  I'm going to stay a little bit into that hour.
[02:54:14.865 --> 02:54:21.512]  I'm going to play a seven days in May trailer piece that Kennedy wanted the film made from the novel.
[02:54:21.532 --> 02:54:25.596]  Of course, he never lived to see the film made about Deep State planning a coup against him.
[02:54:26.539 --> 02:54:28.561]  A lot of folks are calling this seven days in May.
[02:54:29.101 --> 02:54:35.527]  And again, a lot of people want to act like they're against Trump, because that's the trendy thing to do with some people, and like they're kind of in the cool club.
[02:54:35.587 --> 02:54:42.533]  You're in the biggest ding-dong, schmuck, useful idiot, moron, sucker club in the galaxy.
[02:54:43.874 --> 02:54:46.096]  There's no hedging your bets with political cancer.
[02:54:46.636 --> 02:54:50.159]  And that's what orthodox, radical globalism is. 110%.
[02:54:53.717 --> 02:55:04.668]  And again, I don't want to sit here and bash the Muslims all day, but they've been chosen as the big demographic group, as the group that won't comply with liberalism, and so the globalists are going to use it as the tool to smash everything.
[02:55:05.028 --> 02:55:07.090]  And they're doing it, and they mean business.
[02:55:08.371 --> 02:55:13.937]  Please don't forget we're extending the sales on the amazing in-home or in-office air filtration system.
[02:55:14.017 --> 02:55:15.598]  Each unit does a large room.
[02:55:16.784 --> 02:55:18.865]  I've got these all over my house.
[02:55:19.366 --> 02:55:20.746]  I had similar units that were almost $1,000.
[02:55:20.786 --> 02:55:29.071]  And then when these came out, I looked at the specs, similar system, and for $250 or so, I filled up my house with them now.
[02:55:29.171 --> 02:55:31.592]  And they've got a quiet mode that you can't even really hear them on.
[02:55:31.792 --> 02:55:32.293]  It's amazing.
[02:55:32.513 --> 02:55:33.874]  So I even brought some here in the studio.
[02:55:33.894 --> 02:55:34.694]  I'm going to have them added back.
[02:55:35.014 --> 02:55:36.435]  Somebody cleaned the studio and took them out of here.
[02:55:36.455 --> 02:55:39.377]  But the point is, I'm going to add the Alexa Pures back in the studio.
[02:55:40.217 --> 02:55:42.239]  And they're just amazing.
[02:55:42.660 --> 02:55:44.982]  Comparable units are $400 to $600 now.
[02:55:45.903 --> 02:55:47.585]  The price of this technology has gone down.
[02:55:48.045 --> 02:55:49.287]  But ours is still the best deal at $219.
[02:55:49.327 --> 02:55:49.687]  It's $149 right now.
[02:55:49.787 --> 02:55:50.688]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:55:50.708 --> 02:55:52.810]  But we're going to end that special this week.
[02:55:52.911 --> 02:55:55.273]  I'm extending it for another week.
[02:56:03.348 --> 02:56:06.872]  Brain Force Plus is 55% off our amazing Nootropic.
[02:56:07.233 --> 02:56:07.933]  That's brain pill.
[02:56:08.554 --> 02:56:11.337]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen.
[02:56:11.357 --> 02:56:14.341]  Find out why the iodine conspiracy is so important.
[02:56:14.401 --> 02:56:15.202]  Secret 12, 55% off.
[02:56:15.903 --> 02:56:17.405]  Oil of Oregano, it's $17.76 as well.
[02:56:17.425 --> 02:56:18.145]  That's only 29% off on that.
[02:56:22.270 --> 02:56:27.937]  Oil of Oregano is 40% off, 55% off on Secret 12, Survival Shills 55, Rain Force 55.
[02:56:28.418 --> 02:56:30.080]  And we have the John Oliver Challenge.
[02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:33.444]  Anybody can research the health effects and the good things about bone broth.
[02:56:33.804 --> 02:56:37.709]  This is concentrated with turmeric, chaga mushroom, beet pollen, and so much more.
[02:56:37.869 --> 02:56:38.450]  All organic.
[02:56:38.770 --> 02:56:40.272]  We now have a strawberry flavor as well.
[02:56:40.352 --> 02:56:41.493]  I think it tastes great with milk.
[02:56:42.254 --> 02:56:43.175]  Or whipped up with whey.
[02:56:43.195 --> 02:56:47.797]  We also have a great whey, a true whey from one of the top developers of organic grass-fed in the country.
[02:56:48.077 --> 02:56:49.538]  Heavily discounted, so check that out.
[02:56:49.798 --> 02:57:03.486]  When you shop with the good guys for things you and your family need, then you fund an operation that has the globalists completely freaking out that is an emergency intelligence beacon to the president and the world about the global crime syndicates operations.
[02:57:04.126 --> 02:57:06.688]  They can't believe that we won't just join them
[02:57:08.715 --> 02:57:12.877]  They can't believe that we just don't go, oh, you're the power, let me sell out immediately.
[02:57:13.257 --> 02:57:17.519]  They came to me and offered me a million dollars almost 20 years ago and couldn't believe when I didn't take it.
[02:57:18.099 --> 02:57:26.083]  Then it was 3 million, then it was 10 million, and they said, it was like major executives, this is all off record, of course, I can give them the names, but it was like, we'll give you 10 million.
[02:57:26.723 --> 02:57:28.204]  And they're like, we don't get paid that.
[02:57:29.417 --> 02:57:30.298]  They were getting really mad.
[02:57:30.398 --> 02:57:31.759]  I just said, not gonna happen, bro.
[02:57:32.079 --> 02:57:33.740]  You're not gonna control me.
[02:57:34.141 --> 02:57:35.362]  I'm gonna say what I want.
[02:57:35.462 --> 02:57:38.404]  And now, look where we are thanks to you.
[02:57:39.325 --> 02:57:43.067]  And we're hiring more people and more crew and launching more shows this month.
[02:57:43.087 --> 02:57:45.049]  In just a few weeks, we launched David Knight's program.
[02:57:45.569 --> 02:57:46.450]  Real News with David Knight.
[02:57:46.630 --> 02:57:48.432]  By the way, I announced that weeks ago.
[02:57:48.612 --> 02:57:49.993]  Trump's new show is called Real News.
[02:57:51.824 --> 02:57:57.307]  And, because that's just what it is, I mean, it's not that we're plagiarizing each other, it's just we're synced up.
[02:57:57.728 --> 02:57:59.589]  Vulcan mind-meld.
[02:58:00.489 --> 02:58:01.670]  Live long and prosper.
[02:58:02.130 --> 02:58:03.591]  Defeat the pedophile networks.
[02:58:03.972 --> 02:58:04.952]  Crush the globalist.
[02:58:05.372 --> 02:58:06.433]  Return the republic.
[02:58:07.914 --> 02:58:09.235]  Return the republic.
[02:58:09.335 --> 02:58:11.376]  Return what you have stolen.
[02:58:11.856 --> 02:58:14.198]  You are in great danger, globalist.
[02:58:16.562 --> 02:58:21.067]  Yes, we have the political will, the Excalibur of information warfare.
[02:58:21.087 --> 02:58:21.888]  And we're going in.
[02:58:22.649 --> 02:58:23.310]  We're in now.
[02:58:23.750 --> 02:58:24.591]  We're going through.
[02:58:24.611 --> 02:58:26.493]  And we're going beyond.
[02:58:27.695 --> 02:58:31.019]  Whether we escape on the other side or whether we're smashed into stardust.
[02:58:32.153 --> 02:58:34.375]  And through the fulcrum, we're going beyond.

[02:59:56.191 --> 03:00:02.099]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:14.546 --> 03:00:17.690]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:17.790 --> 03:00:23.857]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.

[03:00:25.559 --> 03:00:27.501]  Lynch caught lying to the Clintons.
[03:00:27.561 --> 03:00:29.804]  Caught lying about not talking to the Clintons.
[03:00:30.264 --> 03:00:32.086]  DOJ releases 400 pages of...
[03:00:32.947 --> 03:00:36.992]  Lynch Clinton emails after Comey's FBI said they didn't exist.
[03:00:37.232 --> 03:00:38.354]  No communications.
[03:00:39.095 --> 03:00:40.737]  Massive perjury to Congress.
[03:00:41.217 --> 03:00:42.218]  Massive fraud.
[03:00:42.659 --> 03:00:43.760]  Massive crime.
[03:00:44.201 --> 03:00:45.062]  Red flag.
[03:00:45.202 --> 03:00:46.183]  Smoking gun.
[03:00:46.564 --> 03:00:48.166]  Hand in the cookie jar.
[03:00:49.167 --> 03:00:50.628]  Beyond the tarmac meeting.
[03:00:51.638 --> 03:00:55.240]  But don't worry, Mueller's running along like a good little demon.
[03:00:55.880 --> 03:00:56.781]  Good demon.
[03:00:57.441 --> 03:00:58.322]  Good demon.
[03:00:59.202 --> 03:01:02.684]  There with his little SWAT thing, secret grand jury.
[03:01:02.704 --> 03:01:06.866]  I mean, they had to get a grand jury out of the District of Criminals?
[03:01:07.186 --> 03:01:07.807]  Hilarious.
[03:01:09.082 --> 03:01:14.846]  A lot of folks are drawing parallels to Seven Days in May that a film Kennedy wanted made from a novel.
[03:01:15.287 --> 03:01:16.948]  Of course, he never lived to see the film made.
[03:01:17.228 --> 03:01:18.769]  That's parallels to Trump today.
[03:01:19.470 --> 03:01:21.692]  Here is the trailer from Seven Days in May.
[03:01:24.914 --> 03:01:30.699]  You are so... Suggesting, Mr. President, there's a military plot to take over the government.
[03:01:31.359 --> 03:01:33.261]  This may occur sometime this coming Sunday.
[03:01:34.221 --> 03:01:37.304]  There are some who will say, it can never happen here.
[03:01:38.286 --> 03:01:46.392]  But this is the story of how it could happen in seven days of intrigue, of blackmail, of terror, an eternity of suspense.
[03:01:47.413 --> 03:01:56.840]  This is the astounding story of a military plot to overthrow the government of the United States, which, if successful, would change the fate of every American.
[03:02:08.274 --> 03:02:09.194]  You're a night crawler, Colonel.
[03:02:09.655 --> 03:02:10.095]  A peddler.
[03:02:10.195 --> 03:02:11.055]  You sell information.
[03:02:12.456 --> 03:02:14.737]  Are you sufficiently up on your Bibles to know who Judas was?
[03:02:15.858 --> 03:02:17.078]  Yes, I know who Judas was.
[03:02:18.979 --> 03:02:23.742]  He was a man I worked for and admired, until he disgraced the four stars on his uniform.
[03:02:24.642 --> 03:02:31.786]  Seven days in May, the first day, when a Marine Colonel wondered who was inciting screaming mobs in Madison Square Garden.
[03:02:34.525 --> 03:02:37.067]  I love you Alex.
[03:02:37.167 --> 03:02:41.429]  The second day, that uncovered secret meetings in Washington's back alleys.
[03:02:42.129 --> 03:02:47.452]  The third day, when unknown men prepared to kidnap the president from his private vacation resort.
[03:02:48.153 --> 03:02:53.216]  The fourth day, that brought a secret presidential messenger to death in a plane crash in Spain.
[03:02:53.776 --> 03:02:56.898]  The day a senator of the United States was held against his will.
[03:02:59.820 --> 03:03:00.460]  The fifth day,
[03:03:01.033 --> 03:03:04.016]  When a woman found her past being used for blackmail.
[03:03:04.376 --> 03:03:06.898]  Look, Ellie, if I could tell you why... I'll tell you something!
[03:03:08.420 --> 03:03:10.261]  I was a stupid, impressionable female.
[03:03:11.362 --> 03:03:14.085]  Who let an Air Force General use her like his personal airplane.
[03:03:14.505 --> 03:03:15.266]  The sixth day.
[03:03:15.766 --> 03:03:18.669]  The discovery of a desert base for an airborne task force.
[03:03:19.049 --> 03:03:21.632]  Kept secret even from the President of the United States.
[03:03:27.662 --> 03:03:35.148]  The seventh day, when the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff dared the President of the United States to stop the conspiracy that couldn't be proved.
[03:03:35.168 --> 03:03:36.889]  You're not a weak sister, Mr. President.
[03:03:37.750 --> 03:03:38.990]  You're a criminally weak sister.
[03:03:39.591 --> 03:03:41.312]  You say I've duped the people, General.
[03:03:41.352 --> 03:03:41.913]  I've bilked them.
[03:03:41.973 --> 03:03:42.653]  I've misled them.
[03:03:42.713 --> 03:03:44.815]  I've stripped them naked and made them defenseless.
[03:03:45.375 --> 03:03:47.257]  You accuse me of having lost their faith.
[03:03:47.917 --> 03:03:51.340]  Deliberately and criminally shut my ears to the national voice.
[03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:51.640]  I do.
[03:03:54.289 --> 03:03:56.931]  Well, where the hell have you heard that voice, General?
[03:03:56.971 --> 03:03:57.792]  In freight elevators?
[03:03:58.272 --> 03:03:59.013]  In dark alleys?
[03:03:59.473 --> 03:04:00.894]  In secret places in the dead of night?
[03:04:01.474 --> 03:04:04.216]  How did that voice seep into a locked room full of conspirators?
[03:04:05.037 --> 03:04:07.739]  That's not where you hear the voice of the people, General.
[03:04:07.779 --> 03:04:08.660]  Not in this Republic.
[03:04:08.860 --> 03:04:10.221]  And I will not resign voluntarily.
[03:04:10.881 --> 03:04:11.742]  I'm going to fight you.
[03:04:12.863 --> 03:04:15.405]  And then we'll see which one of us the United States is willing to follow.
[03:04:18.667 --> 03:04:20.609]  Starring Burt Lancaster, Kurt Douglas,
[03:04:24.056 --> 03:04:27.977]  And folks, we are now in that position, and the president's already delivered in six months.
[03:04:28.477 --> 03:04:31.058]  Their whole criminal power structure's being destroyed.
[03:04:31.098 --> 03:04:31.698]  Here's the good news.
[03:04:31.778 --> 03:04:34.959]  Even if they kill Trump and kill me, it doesn't matter now.
[03:04:35.159 --> 03:04:36.699]  Their whole system's blown wide open.
[03:04:36.899 --> 03:04:37.959]  People know it's unelected.
[03:04:37.979 --> 03:04:38.820]  They know it's foreign.
[03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:39.680]  They know it's globus.
[03:04:39.960 --> 03:04:40.880]  They know it's Islamic.
[03:04:41.180 --> 03:04:42.080]  They know it's satanic.
[03:04:42.100 --> 03:04:43.101]  They know it's pedophile.
[03:04:43.161 --> 03:04:46.422]  And they know it's out to get everybody, and it's anti-prosperity.
[03:04:46.722 --> 03:04:52.243]  And so, just rejoice that we're having devastating victories right now, but it's gonna be a long, hard war.
[03:04:52.784 --> 03:04:56.812]  Owen Schroer suited up, wound up, informed and ready to go.
[03:04:57.093 --> 03:04:58.716]  Spread the word for him online.
[03:04:58.977 --> 03:05:01.442]  You are the InfoWar and they can't stop you!
[03:05:07.233 --> 03:05:17.742]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a dangerous, dangerous time, and Trump warns this new low is dangerous for the whole planet, as we need Russia to deal with North Korea and so much more.
[03:05:18.062 --> 03:05:20.765]  So Alexander, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:05:20.805 --> 03:05:23.267]  Alexander Dugin, geopolitical.ru.
[03:05:23.807 --> 03:05:24.928]  You've got the floor, my friend.
[03:05:24.968 --> 03:05:34.497]  Let's go through who the Globalists are, what their aims are, why they hate the United States and Russia so much, and is there any way to stop them before they trigger World War III?
[03:05:36.404 --> 03:05:52.030]  Hi Alex, I'm really happy to to be broadcasted in the United States because I think that your station and your channel and your heroic struggle is a unique
[03:05:52.630 --> 03:06:01.217]  Unique possibility, unique momentum to say the truth that nobody wants to hear.
[03:06:01.697 --> 03:06:13.707]  And first of all, I think that globalists need enemy, but not the right enemy, because the right enemy of globalists are they themselves.
[03:06:14.547 --> 03:06:27.073]  Because they are going to destroy humanity to exchange the humankind by artificial intelligence, by a kind of cyborgs.
[03:06:27.911 --> 03:06:35.354]  And they try to destroy all kind of links of the humanity with its essence.
[03:06:35.714 --> 03:06:44.097]  And that is an essence that is the very, very negative, absolutely negative, satanic plan.
[03:06:44.477 --> 03:06:49.418]  And they need, in order to keep attention elsewhere, they need some enemy.
[03:06:49.898 --> 03:06:54.220]  And they have designated Russia as enemy number one.
[03:06:55.020 --> 03:07:03.445]  It helps for them to deplace attention from the real crimes they commit.
[03:07:04.266 --> 03:07:11.230]  And in the case of Trump, that is trying to reaffirm, reassert America.
[03:07:12.109 --> 03:07:32.326]  To regain its almost lost popularity and the greatness, restored greatness, they try to intimidate him by completely false accusation and hoaxes of Russian intervention in its elections.
[03:07:32.646 --> 03:07:34.328]  So they are globalists.
[03:07:34.608 --> 03:07:36.869]  They try to control everybody.
[03:07:36.929 --> 03:07:40.770]  They try, they want to divide the people and the countries.
[03:07:41.110 --> 03:08:00.616]  Not because some of countries or regimes are wrong or commit some horrible acts, but because in the agenda of globalists, they should be exposed as such, because they serve for their creation of global world government.
[03:08:10.936 --> 03:08:15.617]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[03:08:15.737 --> 03:08:18.938]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:19.198 --> 03:08:23.720]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:08:23.740 --> 03:08:25.460]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:25.720 --> 03:08:27.241]  Crazy times we're living in.
[03:08:29.382 --> 03:08:30.942]  You know, I've got this story here.
[03:08:31.082 --> 03:08:37.584]  Democrat Governor Jerry Brown says abortion shouldn't be the Democrat Party's litmus test.
[03:08:39.076 --> 03:08:49.383]  And you can just stack this story on top of the rest of the stories that is illustrating of how the Democrats are completely falling apart right now.
[03:08:49.883 --> 03:08:52.165]  You got Republican governors switching to Democrats.
[03:08:52.185 --> 03:08:54.787]  You got the Democrat Party is actually in debt right now.
[03:08:54.847 --> 03:08:55.827]  They can't fundraise.
[03:08:56.308 --> 03:08:59.650]  You got the DNC fraud lawsuit being waged against the Democrats right now.
[03:09:00.150 --> 03:09:04.593]  And then you have Governor Jerry Brown saying abortion shouldn't be the party's litmus test.
[03:09:04.633 --> 03:09:08.836]  So now they're all going to be divided on abortion, pro-life, pro-choice matters.
[03:09:10.037 --> 03:09:11.117]  So that's all fine and good.
[03:09:11.177 --> 03:09:12.598]  The Democrats are completely collapsing.
[03:09:12.738 --> 03:09:21.063]  Oh yeah, you have Loretta Lynch, who is now another known liar of the Democrats, along with Clinton and Pelosi and the rest of them.
[03:09:21.083 --> 03:09:26.546]  Now the DOJ pretty much just, well, they did a nice number two on Loretta Lynch, didn't they?
[03:09:27.126 --> 03:09:35.411]  But it's funny, I think, this is what I'm thinking, as Jerry Brown is saying, abortion shouldn't be the Democrat Party litmus test.
[03:09:37.227 --> 03:09:40.510]  Well, America is kind of undergoing its own litmus test right now.
[03:09:41.110 --> 03:09:41.871]  And that's Trump.
[03:09:42.912 --> 03:09:44.873]  Trump is the litmus test.
[03:09:45.534 --> 03:09:50.178]  And we're all sitting here scratching our heads, we're all sitting here asking ourselves,
[03:09:51.994 --> 03:09:53.055]  How is this happening?
[03:09:53.175 --> 03:10:03.180]  How is it they're investigating Trump for Russia collusion, now they're expanding it into his finances, now they're expanding it into his family, now they're expanding it into his entire campaign team?
[03:10:03.681 --> 03:10:18.349]  This ever-expanding probe into President Trump, looking for any one thing they can find to make him illegitimate, say that he needs to be arrested, say that he lied or did this, looking for all of this stuff, it's been ongoing for years, they can't find anything.
[03:10:19.500 --> 03:10:23.044]  They've thrown everything against the wall to try to take Trump down.
[03:10:24.366 --> 03:10:27.749]  Okay, so they continue to fail miserably on that, but what is the litmus test?
[03:10:28.691 --> 03:10:32.935]  The litmus test is the fact that we're all sitting here saying, hold on a second.
[03:10:33.908 --> 03:10:55.923]  How is all of this investigation, all of this probing being done into Trump, but we have nothing on the Clintons, nothing on the Clinton Foundation, nothing on Clinton and Laura Silsby, I mean the list goes on and on, nothing on Clinton's deleted emails, nothing on Debra Washerman Schultz threatening the DC police, nothing on the Elan brothers smashing their hard drives, nothing on Washerman Schultz threatening to get those hard drives back.
[03:10:56.969 --> 03:10:58.350]  Nothing on the Clinton-Uranium deal.
[03:10:58.751 --> 03:10:59.171]  Nothing!
[03:10:59.331 --> 03:11:00.992]  Nothing on Podesta's stock deals.
[03:11:01.333 --> 03:11:01.913]  Just nothing!
[03:11:01.973 --> 03:11:05.176]  Just completely nothing, where we have all the evidence.
[03:11:05.456 --> 03:11:06.017]  It's all there.
[03:11:06.177 --> 03:11:06.937]  We've already seen it.
[03:11:06.957 --> 03:11:07.638]  We already know it.
[03:11:07.678 --> 03:11:08.519]  It's all on paper.
[03:11:09.560 --> 03:11:10.801]  So all of this is going on.
[03:11:10.881 --> 03:11:18.928]  Oh yeah, then you got Loretta Lynch meeting with the Clintons on Tarmac, saying they talked about grandkids for 45 minutes, and then saying that she had no communications.
[03:11:19.248 --> 03:11:20.689]  DOJ releases the emails.
[03:11:20.809 --> 03:11:21.350]  Yeah, you did.
[03:11:21.370 --> 03:11:23.692]  You're a lying sack of crap, Loretta Lynch.
[03:11:24.929 --> 03:11:28.650]  Barack Obama's team unmasking all of these people in the Trump campaign.
[03:11:29.211 --> 03:11:33.532]  Literally, guilt is written on the forehead of all of these Democrats.
[03:11:34.513 --> 03:11:36.253]  100% guilty, right across their forehead.
[03:11:36.833 --> 03:11:39.875]  But meanwhile, there's this probe into Trump.
[03:11:40.015 --> 03:11:41.575]  Okay, so what are we facing here?
[03:11:43.736 --> 03:11:45.737]  Here's the litmus test for America.
[03:11:46.969 --> 03:11:58.098]  If they can actually succeed in taking Trump out, if they actually are successful in this coup to remove Trump from office, the litmus test for America is now on the table.
[03:11:58.559 --> 03:12:14.873]  If we allow that to happen, if we just lay down, lay down our arms, lay down our Constitution, lay down our rights, lay down our common sense, lay down our logic, lay down our sovereignty, lay down our vote, lay it all down,
[03:12:16.397 --> 03:12:18.379]  Then that's the litmus test, America's dead.
[03:12:20.881 --> 03:12:39.037]  You can go ahead and bury the country, and we might still have flags, and we might still have ceremonies, we can still light fireworks on the 4th of July, but if we allow President Trump to be removed from office because of a deep state coup, the litmus test for America is there, and America is dead.
[03:12:41.479 --> 03:12:43.741]  Now I don't think that's how it's going to go.
[03:12:45.191 --> 03:12:48.592]  I feel that the litmus test is going to say, you know what?
[03:12:49.312 --> 03:12:50.972]  You are trying to take down our country.
[03:12:51.532 --> 03:12:59.634]  You are unelected, an unelected shadow government that has been operating behind closed doors, stealing the future from this country for years.
[03:13:00.354 --> 03:13:01.154]  We're done with you now.
[03:13:01.194 --> 03:13:02.174]  We elected a president.
[03:13:02.395 --> 03:13:03.695]  We wanted to do this peacefully.
[03:13:04.055 --> 03:13:05.355]  We tried to do this politically.
[03:13:05.795 --> 03:13:11.977]  The scum that has stolen this country is not going to let that happen.
[03:13:12.017 --> 03:13:14.097]  So that's the real litmus test for America.
[03:13:15.188 --> 03:13:19.371]  Will America let the deep state coup of Donald Trump happen?
[03:13:19.411 --> 03:13:36.082]  Will America sit idly by while this just metastasizing government is just sitting on top of us, selling us to all other buyers, selling us to all large corporations, selling us all over the world, wherever they can find it?
[03:13:37.843 --> 03:13:39.404]  But I don't think that's what's going to happen.
[03:13:40.845 --> 03:13:46.806]  No, I think if they try to remove Trump like they want to, I think that there's going to be a major backlash.
[03:13:48.487 --> 03:13:51.727]  And I actually think that the litmus test is going to say America's not dead.
[03:13:53.148 --> 03:13:54.668]  America's been very tolerant.
[03:13:55.708 --> 03:13:57.508]  America has been very patient.
[03:13:59.289 --> 03:14:00.549]  They've put up with a lot of crap.
[03:14:00.589 --> 03:14:04.470]  They've taken a lot of bruises, a lot of knees, a lot of elbows, a lot of spit in their eye.
[03:14:07.591 --> 03:14:13.996]  But they've had about enough, and I think that if they try to remove Trump from office, that will be the line in the sand.
[03:14:14.936 --> 03:14:18.359]  And the litmus test for America will say that America is not dead.
[03:14:19.980 --> 03:14:21.361]  Now, I hope that we don't find that out.
[03:14:21.441 --> 03:14:23.002]  I hope that the Democrats back off.
[03:14:24.303 --> 03:14:33.269]  I hope that the deep state backs off and lets America live, lets America thrive, at least while we have our president, and then see where it goes from there.
[03:14:33.309 --> 03:14:36.532]  But they can't do that.
[03:14:37.540 --> 03:14:41.945]  You see, the deep state and the globalists cannot let Trump be president.
[03:14:42.706 --> 03:14:45.389]  They cannot let the American people determine their own future.
[03:14:45.829 --> 03:14:47.151]  Because look what's happening, folks.
[03:14:47.771 --> 03:14:49.233]  Millions of jobs are being created.
[03:14:49.533 --> 03:14:51.215]  People are investing in America again.
[03:14:51.575 --> 03:14:57.222]  America is going to be the world power again and kick everyone's ass like they have always done.
[03:14:58.117 --> 03:15:00.498]  But the globalists cannot stand that.
[03:15:01.199 --> 03:15:18.209]  They want centralized power, not in the hands of the Republic, not in your hands, in the hands of a centralized government that will determine who gets to grow, whose growth gets stagnated, whose growth gets boomed, where the population movements happen.
[03:15:18.549 --> 03:15:19.870]  They're in charge of all that.
[03:15:20.210 --> 03:15:25.574]  And if there's an America, a free and booming America, then that's not going to work.
[03:15:26.354 --> 03:15:28.295]  Because America's going to dominate the culture.
[03:15:28.695 --> 03:15:30.876]  America's going to dominate the trade market.
[03:15:31.296 --> 03:15:34.137]  America's going to show the world what a free market system does.
[03:15:34.717 --> 03:15:43.960]  And it's going to create the greatest standard of living in the history of the world.
[03:15:45.080 --> 03:15:49.482]  More so than the standard that this country has already shown.
[03:15:50.602 --> 03:15:52.143]  So that's the litmus test for America.
[03:15:53.504 --> 03:16:00.837]  Will America fight back against the globalist deep state that is trying to take down our elected president?
[03:16:02.102 --> 03:16:03.082]  I say yes.
[03:16:03.223 --> 03:16:04.603]  This is what Savage is talking about.
[03:16:04.823 --> 03:16:06.244]  This is what Alex Jones has talked about.
[03:16:06.284 --> 03:16:12.047]  That's why he went on Piers Morgan's show and said, you try to take our firearms, we will rise up.
[03:16:12.407 --> 03:16:17.209]  You try to take our elected president, you try to take our right to vote, we will rise up.
[03:16:17.309 --> 03:16:18.830]  It's the same thing.
[03:16:18.910 --> 03:16:21.051]  That's the first amendment they're trying to take away.
[03:16:21.111 --> 03:16:22.271]  Your right to vote.
[03:16:22.932 --> 03:16:23.932]  And see, but that's what I'm saying.
[03:16:23.952 --> 03:16:25.173]  They already do all this.
[03:16:25.533 --> 03:16:27.694]  They already do all this with the rigged polls.
[03:16:28.054 --> 03:16:29.995]  They already do all this with the illegal votes.
[03:16:31.104 --> 03:16:33.505]  They already do this by rigging the voting machines, folks!
[03:16:33.625 --> 03:16:36.807]  Who knows if we even ever have a fair election with these electronic voting machines?
[03:16:37.087 --> 03:16:38.227]  They break the law!
[03:16:39.468 --> 03:16:40.168]  In Texas!
[03:16:40.808 --> 03:16:45.410]  They break the law so that you cannot have a paper ballot!
[03:16:45.650 --> 03:16:46.811]  Do you understand this?!
[03:16:47.731 --> 03:16:48.532]  So, but America said...
[03:16:49.449 --> 03:16:49.889]  Fine.
[03:16:50.749 --> 03:16:51.990]  Rape my privacy.
[03:16:52.470 --> 03:16:53.590]  Rape my family.
[03:16:53.910 --> 03:16:54.851]  Rape my income.
[03:16:55.091 --> 03:16:56.111]  Just rape it all!
[03:16:56.371 --> 03:16:57.731]  Just leave me alone!
[03:16:58.271 --> 03:17:00.952]  If you just leave me alone, I'll leave you alone.
[03:17:01.232 --> 03:17:02.553]  But they're not leaving us alone.
[03:17:02.573 --> 03:17:03.893]  They're coming for our guns.
[03:17:04.113 --> 03:17:05.433]  They're coming for our president.
[03:17:05.453 --> 03:17:07.194]  They want to vaccinate our kids to death.
[03:17:07.454 --> 03:17:08.454]  So we've had enough.
[03:17:08.854 --> 03:17:10.295]  So you take our president out.
[03:17:10.795 --> 03:17:13.476]  You try a deep state coup against President Trump.
[03:17:13.836 --> 03:17:15.796]  You're going to see what America really is.
[03:17:16.716 --> 03:17:18.377]  And it's so funny to me
[03:17:20.123 --> 03:17:28.247]  I see these polls that say President Trump, 38% approval rating, 52% say they disapprove of Donald Trump.
[03:17:28.267 --> 03:17:31.988]  That's probably most Hollywood, New York, California, these people.
[03:17:32.048 --> 03:17:32.308]  Okay.
[03:17:33.929 --> 03:17:37.851]  So they're thinking in their minds, we've really got the numbers.
[03:17:38.031 --> 03:17:39.751]  We've really got the hearts and minds of America.
[03:17:39.791 --> 03:17:41.172]  Look at Trump's low approval rating.
[03:17:41.452 --> 03:17:43.213]  Look at how many people don't like Trump.
[03:17:44.693 --> 03:17:45.633]  I got news for you.
[03:17:46.354 --> 03:18:00.860]  When the rubber meets the road, those 52% of people that say they don't approve of Trump are going to be hiding in their mom's basement, cowering under a table if this country actually decides to fight for its sovereignty again, fight for its future again.
[03:18:01.300 --> 03:18:05.724]  So I don't care if you have 70% of people that say they disapprove of Trump.
[03:18:06.285 --> 03:18:16.133]  If you try to remove Trump from office, 70% of people that disapprove of Trump are going to be nowhere to be found, and the 30% of people that approve of Trump are going to be in the streets!
[03:18:17.435 --> 03:18:23.600]  That's why Julian Assange tweeted out that picture of Venezuela, where you have millions of people in Venezuela.
[03:18:23.680 --> 03:18:25.762]  Literally, the streets are flooded with people.
[03:18:25.842 --> 03:18:27.404]  It's a river of people in the streets.
[03:18:28.666 --> 03:18:39.935]  Trying to remove the communist dictator from power, and Julian Assange tweets this video out and says, this is what's going to happen to America if you remove President Trump from office.
[03:18:40.315 --> 03:18:40.936]  Exactly.
[03:18:42.397 --> 03:18:42.977]  Exactly.
[03:18:43.478 --> 03:18:43.858]  It could be 10%.
[03:18:44.939 --> 03:18:53.606]  If 10% approved of Trump, you would still see those 10% fighting for this country, and the 90% being jacklegs doing nothing.
[03:18:54.349 --> 03:18:55.649]  Because that's what the 90% are.
[03:18:55.689 --> 03:18:57.510]  We've exposed these people in the streets.
[03:18:57.950 --> 03:18:58.690]  They're nothings.
[03:18:58.710 --> 03:19:00.350]  They have no intellect, no knowledge.
[03:19:01.511 --> 03:19:02.791]  Just, they're literal nothings.
[03:19:03.591 --> 03:19:04.311]  So here's the deal.
[03:19:04.391 --> 03:19:05.992]  There's the video of Venezuela, folks.
[03:19:06.012 --> 03:19:06.872]  Truly powerful footage.
[03:19:07.492 --> 03:19:10.673]  Imagine that in America if they tried to remove President Trump.
[03:19:10.713 --> 03:19:11.373]  And that's what it would be.
[03:19:11.713 --> 03:19:13.013]  So I want to hear your thoughts on this.
[03:19:13.773 --> 03:19:15.454]  Let's take your calls on the other side.
[03:19:17.254 --> 03:19:19.155]  1-877... What's the number?
[03:19:19.275 --> 03:19:21.116]  Can you put the number up on the screen for me guys here?
[03:19:21.136 --> 03:19:21.976]  We don't have a number in here.
[03:19:22.677 --> 03:19:23.637]  So we'll open up the phone lines.
[03:19:23.697 --> 03:19:24.157]  I want to hear.
[03:19:24.177 --> 03:19:29.720]  What do you think will happen if they really try to take Trump from office?
[03:19:29.740 --> 03:19:31.741]  They're trying to isolate him from news.
[03:19:32.041 --> 03:19:34.062]  They're trying to isolate him from his constituents.
[03:19:34.082 --> 03:19:34.442]  1-800-259-09231.
[03:19:34.462 --> 03:19:34.883]  1-800-259-21... We'll get that.
[03:19:34.903 --> 03:19:36.363]  They already know the number anyway.
[03:19:36.383 --> 03:19:38.804]  We're going to take your calls on the other side, folks.
[03:19:46.869 --> 03:19:50.152]  What do you think will happen if they try to remove Trump from office?
[03:19:50.372 --> 03:19:54.395]  What do you see happening if they actually try to remove Trump from office?
[03:19:54.575 --> 03:19:56.757]  We need to get out ahead of this so they don't do it.
[03:19:56.997 --> 03:19:58.319]  Trump is the president, man!
[03:19:58.799 --> 03:20:00.000]  Let him keep kicking ass!
[03:20:09.036 --> 03:20:13.837]  An illegal teenage immigrant from Honduras has been charged with killing his mother.
[03:20:13.977 --> 03:20:19.778]  Punez is a so-called dreamer, protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.
[03:20:21.158 --> 03:20:26.080]  A truck had smashed the family's car on the right side.
[03:20:26.480 --> 03:20:28.800]  That's where Lennox was sitting in his little car seat.
[03:20:29.240 --> 03:20:33.241]  Border officials say Banda is a Mexican national in the country illegally.
[03:20:33.701 --> 03:20:35.401]  He's been deported 15 times in 15 years.
[03:20:38.582 --> 03:20:48.685]  Via Lopez has a sordid story that includes a prior deportation and identity fraud in addition to the sexual assault of a friend's teenage daughter.
[03:20:49.025 --> 03:20:53.666]  But I have a simple message today for every gang member and criminal alien.
[03:20:54.506 --> 03:21:01.188]  We will find you, we will arrest you, we will jail you, and we will deport you.
[03:21:11.775 --> 03:21:13.636]  He was deported a whopping eight times.
[03:21:13.976 --> 03:21:16.578]  Suspected in a deadly hit-and-run earlier this week.
[03:21:16.898 --> 03:21:21.941]  He's charged with sex abuse, sodomy, burglary, robbery, assault, and kidnapping.
[03:21:22.241 --> 03:21:26.243]  Court records show he's been deported and returned 20 different times.
[03:21:26.463 --> 03:21:29.385]  The father of two killed in a horrifying crash.
[03:21:29.805 --> 03:21:34.567]  Police say that the driver was a drunk, unlicensed, illegal immigrant.
[03:21:34.827 --> 03:21:41.509]  According to an ICE news release, he is a known gang member and has been previously deported four times.
[03:21:42.009 --> 03:21:50.132]  Tonight, police say an illegal immigrant with a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit slammed into the back of an SUV carrying a family of four.
[03:21:50.612 --> 03:21:53.253]  He had been arrested just hours before this crash.
[03:22:01.298 --> 03:22:09.886]  A woman telling deputies she was sure she was going to die after deputies say this man, Juan Ortega Orozco, broke into her home and crept into her bed.
[03:22:09.986 --> 03:22:11.507]  He's in this country illegally.
[03:22:12.948 --> 03:22:15.871]  He has a rich criminal history of violating the law.
[03:22:15.991 --> 03:22:22.297]  In the past two years, he's been charged with five felonies, including trafficking meth and leading the scene of a crash.
[03:22:33.908 --> 03:22:42.393]  Jermaine Daniels says in a change from under the Obama administration, federal agents now appear to be rounding up any undocumented person they come in contact with.
[03:22:42.433 --> 03:22:46.076]  Federal agents eating breakfast one minute, arresting restaurant staff the next.
[03:22:46.576 --> 03:22:49.858]  Illegal border crossings are down reportedly 70%.
[03:22:50.779 --> 03:22:56.382]  Arrests inside the country are up 40% and demands for removal up 80% as well.
[03:22:57.944 --> 03:23:01.028]  But, you know, we can't apologize for enforcing the law.
[03:23:01.048 --> 03:23:05.093]  If you break the law, that's a choice that you make, and there are consequences to that.
[03:23:33.976 --> 03:23:38.599]  We have private labeled it, and it is the exact same product, just the name is different.

[03:24:10.333 --> 03:24:12.539]  Well, the deep state wants a coup against President Trump.

[03:25:20.913 --> 03:25:23.815]  The new Super Blue Mouthwash!
[03:25:23.955 --> 03:25:28.898]  As usual, we get a new product and we have an introductory price on that.
[03:25:28.918 --> 03:25:34.322]  11% off, $17.76, the brand new Super Blue Mouthwash.
[03:25:34.662 --> 03:25:37.624]  And take advantage of the John Oliver Challenge, folks!
[03:25:39.062 --> 03:25:49.413]  It's so funny to listen to, and who knows what John Oliver, he might just be reading a teleprompter, he's like, apparently there's a new craze called bone broth, apparently there's a new craze!
[03:25:50.734 --> 03:25:54.759]  This was a craze that was like, it started up like a few years ago.
[03:25:54.839 --> 03:25:57.541]  People started getting into bone broth and bone broth supplements.
[03:25:57.581 --> 03:26:01.325]  It just shows you how behind the times and out of touch with
[03:26:02.006 --> 03:26:03.147]  Reality, these people are.
[03:26:03.187 --> 03:26:05.589]  So, take advantage of the John Oliver Special.
[03:26:06.070 --> 03:26:08.872]  We're really proud to bring you the John Oliver Special.
[03:26:09.332 --> 03:26:12.855]  And we'd like to thank John Oliver for plugging our products on his show.
[03:26:12.895 --> 03:26:13.756]  That was a free plug.
[03:26:14.196 --> 03:26:17.379]  The John Oliver Special, folks, chocolate or strawberry caveman.
[03:26:17.399 --> 03:26:18.300]  We give you your options.
[03:26:18.340 --> 03:26:19.241]  We want to be tolerant.
[03:26:19.401 --> 03:26:24.565]  You know, we don't want to... You can have strawberry or you can have the chocolate caveman, plus the True Whey Protein.
[03:26:25.606 --> 03:26:28.868]  So now you're talking about, you got vanilla, strawberry, chocolate.
[03:26:28.908 --> 03:26:33.490]  We made sure that we were very tolerant for all the liberals that like John Oliver out there.
[03:26:33.510 --> 03:26:35.951]  So you can get your vanilla, your strawberry, your chocolate.
[03:26:36.291 --> 03:26:38.032]  That's a John Oliver special.
[03:26:38.412 --> 03:26:45.955]  Just a salute and a thank you to John Oliver for plugging our products for free on air, for giving us one of the best weekends we've ever had.
[03:26:46.035 --> 03:26:48.297]  So in honor of John, look at that!
[03:26:48.357 --> 03:26:48.597]  What a, oh!
[03:26:49.617 --> 03:26:50.857]  Thank you so much, John Oliver.
[03:26:51.298 --> 03:26:59.060]  In honor of John Oliver's great free plug that probably cost people millions of dollars to advertise on his show, we got it for free.
[03:26:59.340 --> 03:27:00.560]  So thank you, John Oliver.
[03:27:00.900 --> 03:27:03.321]  And because of that, we're doing the John Oliver Special.
[03:27:04.021 --> 03:27:10.243]  Under $70, that's 30% off, you get the True Whey Protein and a bottle of Caveman.
[03:27:10.283 --> 03:27:11.904]  You cannot beat the John Oliver Special.
[03:27:11.944 --> 03:27:14.344]  He might need to take some Caveman himself.
[03:27:14.745 --> 03:27:15.925]  Okay, so the question is,
[03:27:16.954 --> 03:27:19.535]  What will happen if they remove Trump from office?
[03:27:19.615 --> 03:27:34.962]  If they actually remove Donald Trump from office, whether it be politically, with the grand jury, or the grand jury can't do it, but whether they impeach him, whatever, or kill him, whatever it is, whichever way, however they can, whatever they choose, if they remove Trump from office, what do you think would happen?
[03:27:35.103 --> 03:27:38.664]  Let's start with, let's go to Steven in Florida.
[03:27:39.325 --> 03:27:42.146]  Steven, what do you think would happen if they remove Trump from office?
[03:27:43.595 --> 03:27:53.746]  Yeah, hey Owen, well first of all I want to say this, and I hope you'll get this information Alex, I tweeted this to him, and this ties in with what you're asking about Trump.
[03:27:54.327 --> 03:28:00.594]  You guys need to look into the background of Rodney Howard Brown, the so-called pastor from South Africa.
[03:28:01.331 --> 03:28:03.452]  That guy is as phony as a $3 bill.
[03:28:03.472 --> 03:28:06.074]  Alright, well that's a separate issue right now.
[03:28:06.214 --> 03:28:07.294]  I don't know anything about that.
[03:28:07.354 --> 03:28:08.795]  I'm not talking about the pastor.
[03:28:08.935 --> 03:28:11.997]  I want to ask you what happens if Trump removes from office.
[03:28:12.017 --> 03:28:13.778]  So if you want to answer that question, please do.
[03:28:13.838 --> 03:28:14.799]  If not, we're going to move on.
[03:28:16.359 --> 03:28:17.720]  Well, here's what I say.
[03:28:17.740 --> 03:28:28.406]  I've been trying to get tweets through to all the people, you know, out there on Twitter and posts on Facebook, warning people about what McMaster and Mueller and these guys are doing.
[03:28:28.446 --> 03:28:29.747]  I take this very seriously.
[03:28:30.738 --> 03:28:35.745]  I really think they're going to try and kill him and his family, just like the Bolsheviks did with the Tsars.
[03:28:36.586 --> 03:28:39.850]  And so, the thing is, is that, here's what I believe.
[03:28:41.266 --> 03:28:45.810]  Trump's got so much of a base, and it's more than 50%.
[03:28:45.890 --> 03:28:47.911]  I don't care what the media says, they're lying.
[03:28:48.272 --> 03:28:50.673]  Yeah, who's taking these polls anyway?
[03:28:51.054 --> 03:28:54.116]  It's the same thing like Mark Zuckerberg thinks he has a chance to be president.
[03:28:54.156 --> 03:28:58.600]  He doesn't realize, hey bro, people that vote aren't all on Facebook.
[03:28:58.620 --> 03:29:03.003]  There's a whole class of millions of people that aren't on your stupid Facebook, bro.
[03:29:03.463 --> 03:29:03.964]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:29:04.755 --> 03:29:05.796]  No, we're good.
[03:29:19.281 --> 03:29:26.125]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[03:29:26.165 --> 03:29:30.927]  And here's the other thing too, because Trump has a big family and such a big base, they're not going to be able to get away with this.
[03:29:31.207 --> 03:29:37.531]  And here's the thing, regardless of the whole thing, whatever you think about Pastor Brown, the point is, they're saying this!
[03:29:37.551 --> 03:29:39.052]  I mean, they're all saying it!
[03:29:39.372 --> 03:29:39.832]  Brennan!
[03:29:40.132 --> 03:29:40.672]  Clapper!
[03:29:40.933 --> 03:29:41.333]  Gore!
[03:29:41.673 --> 03:29:43.613]  They're all saying remove Trump from office.
[03:29:43.633 --> 03:29:44.894]  They're saying it all over the news.
[03:29:44.934 --> 03:29:47.774]  CNN has Kathy Griffin with a beheaded ISIS head.
[03:29:48.414 --> 03:29:49.635]  So, of course they're saying it.
[03:29:49.655 --> 03:29:50.955]  We'll be right back with more of your calls.
[03:29:52.175 --> 03:29:53.096]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.596 --> 03:29:55.196]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.116 --> 03:29:58.977]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:05.898 --> 03:30:08.439]  Well, it doesn't matter if it's the Financial Times of London,
[03:30:09.588 --> 03:30:19.692]  Whether it's the Washington Post, whether it's the Economist magazine, or the Harvard magazine, they all say globalism is collapsing, people are turning against it.
[03:30:19.992 --> 03:30:30.016]  We're not turning against internationalism, or being a citizen of the world if you want to live all over the world, or working with other countries, or accepting other cultures if you choose to adopt them.
[03:30:30.896 --> 03:30:38.318]  But we're not going to be ruled by carbon taxes that bureaucrats and Rothschilds and Rockefellers and Soroses make money from.
[03:30:38.378 --> 03:30:40.539]  It doesn't mean Brexit's perfect.
[03:30:40.559 --> 03:30:42.059]  It doesn't mean Trumpism is perfect.
[03:30:42.380 --> 03:30:47.281]  It means it's about taking the power back to the people, back to the states, back to the government.
[03:30:47.381 --> 03:30:52.263]  And Stefan Molyneux is a businessman, author, researcher, very popular radio TV host.
[03:30:52.623 --> 03:30:54.303]  Really appreciate him joining us for the next 30 minutes.
[03:30:54.643 --> 03:30:55.944]  Freedomainradio.com.
[03:30:56.204 --> 03:30:58.344]  Stefan Molyneux on Twitter.
[03:30:58.444 --> 03:30:59.585]  Freedomainradio on YouTube.
[03:31:00.245 --> 03:31:02.707]  Hundreds of millions of views, reaching tens of millions of people a week.
[03:31:02.867 --> 03:31:08.671]  Stefan Molyneux, looking at that, I mean, I don't know how to state the level of history we are at right now.
[03:31:08.711 --> 03:31:11.013]  I mean, I cannot overstate that to folks.
[03:31:11.093 --> 03:31:12.814]  We are at such an epic moment.
[03:31:13.295 --> 03:31:19.339]  It will never, ever in human history come down to as important a moment, Alex, and I really want to get this across to your listeners.
[03:31:19.940 --> 03:31:24.003]  If the state wins, if the globalists win, if the communists and the socialists win,
[03:31:24.583 --> 03:31:34.128]  Capitalism has delivered unto them such monitoring and control and video technology that it is entirely possible we will never ever be free again.
[03:31:34.528 --> 03:31:35.569]  It comes down to this.
[03:31:35.829 --> 03:31:40.251]  We have the technology to communicate free and peaceful and voluntary ideas across the world.
[03:31:40.631 --> 03:31:44.033]  They have the technology to control everything we do, to monitor everything
[03:31:44.053 --> 03:31:48.134]  Everything we do, they're talking about bringing in monitoring of the internet in the UK and so on.
[03:31:48.635 --> 03:31:51.176]  If we lose, we may never ever win again.
[03:31:51.216 --> 03:31:54.457]  There won't be some big cycle of history and your great-grandkids will be free.
[03:31:54.737 --> 03:31:55.637]  It comes down to now.
[03:31:55.897 --> 03:31:59.799]  They would use every tool in their arsenal to win and they're trying it.
[03:31:59.899 --> 03:32:12.183]  We must use every legal tool in our arsenal to fight back, take no prisoners, push forward every agenda, challenge every relationship, push forward because it's now, literally, or never, I strongly believe.
[03:32:12.523 --> 03:32:24.494]  They're going to have a breakaway civilization, put us into total squalor, use it to control us, and then use the fruits of the human mind and open society that has given us almost godlike powers to shackle us!
[03:32:24.514 --> 03:32:27.036]  I mean, this is... this is... un...
[03:32:28.097 --> 03:32:29.238]  Unspeakably evil!
[03:32:29.278 --> 03:32:29.858]  What do we do?
[03:32:30.379 --> 03:32:30.959]  What do you do?
[03:32:31.239 --> 03:32:32.600]  You have to stop protesting.
[03:32:32.620 --> 03:32:33.941]  You have to start getting out there.
[03:32:33.961 --> 03:32:36.703]  You have to recognize that this is an emergency.
[03:32:36.743 --> 03:32:40.405]  There is no DEF CON level higher than what we are facing right now.
[03:32:40.445 --> 03:32:43.167]  You need to pull out all the stops, get all the information you can.
[03:32:43.507 --> 03:32:45.388]  You have a global communications network.
[03:32:45.428 --> 03:32:46.749]  You can tap into it anytime.
[03:32:46.789 --> 03:32:48.190]  You can challenge people in your life.
[03:32:48.630 --> 03:32:55.894]  It is down to this, because if we don't solve this peacefully, the kind of weapons that we have if it turns to war might end the entire planet.
[03:32:55.915 --> 03:32:56.315]  Wow.
[03:32:56.815 --> 03:32:57.839]  Stefan Molyneux, thank you.
[03:32:57.979 --> 03:33:00.989]  Always enlightening, but today was extremely powerful.
[03:33:01.049 --> 03:33:01.210]  Wow!
[03:33:11.941 --> 03:33:18.443]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.904 --> 03:33:22.345]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[03:33:24.125 --> 03:33:29.287]  Is there any doubt McMaster's is working against the American people?
[03:33:30.028 --> 03:33:31.328]  Here's a story from Breitbart.
[03:33:31.348 --> 03:33:32.509]  This was published yesterday.
[03:33:32.529 --> 03:33:38.531]  McMaster worked at Think Tank, backed by Soros-funded group that helped Obama sell Iran deal.
[03:33:40.003 --> 03:33:40.383]  Shocker.
[03:33:41.164 --> 03:33:42.985]  White House National Security Advisor H.R.
[03:33:43.005 --> 03:33:56.416]  McMaster served at a UK-based think tank financed by a controversial George Soros-funded group identified by the Obama White House as central in helping to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the public and news media.
[03:33:57.156 --> 03:33:58.918]  Isn't that just a sweet little juicy?
[03:34:00.302 --> 03:34:11.427]  From September 2006 to February 2017, McMaster is listed as a member of International Institute for Strategic Studies, where he served as a Consulting Senior Fellow.
[03:34:11.767 --> 03:34:19.110]  The IISS describes itself as a world-leading authority on global security, political risks, and military conflict.
[03:34:19.890 --> 03:34:39.897]  So of course that has George Soros' fingerprints all over it and then you have the ties into the Obama-Iran nuclear deal and there's McMaster sitting right on top of there as a senior fellow, the bald-headed chrome dome swamp creature.
[03:34:41.397 --> 03:34:42.638]  It is amazing how you can just
[03:34:45.031 --> 03:34:48.832]  I mean, you can just look at these people and see who they are.
[03:34:48.852 --> 03:34:54.774]  I mean, George Soros, McMaster, Debbie Washerman Schultz, Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[03:34:56.894 --> 03:35:01.316]  Folks, God is trying to tell you these people are wicked, evil creatures!
[03:35:04.756 --> 03:35:13.299]  I mean, point to me all the liberals out there that actually look like they're full of life, just blossoming with passion and love for humanity.
[03:35:14.355 --> 03:35:15.256]  Show me the liberals!
[03:35:17.538 --> 03:35:18.479]  They aren't out there.
[03:35:21.301 --> 03:35:30.729]  I thank God for exposing these people, physically manifesting these demonic creatures into the human form that they've taken.
[03:35:32.591 --> 03:35:33.572]  Let's go back to your calls.
[03:35:33.612 --> 03:35:34.353]  The question is,
[03:35:35.509 --> 03:35:39.731]  What do you think will happen if President Trump is removed from office?
[03:35:39.831 --> 03:35:41.212]  I know we have a caller in Canada.
[03:35:41.252 --> 03:35:43.993]  I just want to take these American callers first, but I'll get to you.
[03:35:44.593 --> 03:35:48.255]  Let's go to Margaret in Oklahoma.
[03:35:48.315 --> 03:35:51.976]  What do you think is going to happen if the deep state removes Trump from office?
[03:35:52.797 --> 03:35:58.159]  Well, I think that since we are so disorganized that they will just roll over us.
[03:35:58.860 --> 03:36:08.145]  Because what we needed already was to have people on the local level talking to each other about the situation and what they're going to do.
[03:36:08.445 --> 03:36:22.913]  There was a young man, okay, who put up, it's kind of like a continuity of government on the citizen level, but he said that the government is so corrupt that it's going to fall from its own weight, and we just have to get ready and be ready when it happens.
[03:36:23.273 --> 03:36:24.134]  But the thing was,
[03:36:26.082 --> 03:36:33.746]  He came up with something that he wanted people to be able to organize and do things that the government didn't have to give permission for.
[03:36:33.766 --> 03:36:37.068]  And he had something called the Solution to Reclaiming Liberty.
[03:36:37.448 --> 03:36:38.368]  It was in four parts.
[03:36:38.889 --> 03:36:40.329]  The first part was a declaration.
[03:36:40.689 --> 03:36:43.751]  People declared that they liked their liberty and they didn't want to give it up.
[03:36:44.540 --> 03:36:52.146]  The second part was called the Liberty Bell, that anyone would call this number if the police were harassing them and people would show up with cell phones to help them.
[03:36:52.707 --> 03:36:57.811]  The third part was the Common Law Court, that they were actually doing this in Alaska.
[03:36:58.772 --> 03:37:06.538]  Here's the problem, because I hear what you're saying and I think that the premise is a good idea, it's just that it's getting a little too complicated for most people, just to be honest with you.
[03:37:06.558 --> 03:37:09.561]  Most people, once you get to step three, you're just going to lose them.
[03:37:10.001 --> 03:37:33.041]  I had a similar idea that was you just find like-minded people locally, maybe that means going door-to-door, passing out a flyer, maybe putting a Trump flag up in your yard, just some little tactic you can do to find like-minded people, and then you take it one step further, and once you have the like-minded people that want to work to save this country, you say, okay, here's what we're going to do.
[03:37:33.442 --> 03:37:35.063]  I was going to do this in St.
[03:37:35.083 --> 03:37:36.444]  Louis, actually, before I moved here.
[03:37:37.245 --> 03:37:40.969]  You find the like-minded people and you basically prepare yourself for the worst.
[03:37:41.289 --> 03:37:55.803]  And you say, okay, if the worst happens, which would be they remove Trump from power, or the power grid goes down, a big terror attack, whatever it could be, some sort of blast that takes out the entire electric grid.
[03:37:57.369 --> 03:38:10.819]  So then you say, okay, you've got all these people together, you're responsible for ammo, you're responsible for firearms, you're responsible for food, you're responsible for water, you're responsible for mapping out where we need to go, you're responsible for shelter, you're responsible for this, you're responsible for seats.
[03:38:11.239 --> 03:38:13.641]  So then you kind of create your little emergency community.
[03:38:13.661 --> 03:38:20.146]  I don't know if that's exactly what you were talking about, but that's kind of, I feel like, what you were talking about.
[03:38:20.707 --> 03:38:25.030]  And the point you're making is that Americans are, for the most part, individualists.
[03:38:25.470 --> 03:38:31.894]  We take care of ourselves, we take care of our families, we take care of our own property, and we don't really bother you.
[03:38:31.914 --> 03:38:33.695]  We don't really get involved with your business.
[03:38:33.735 --> 03:38:35.116]  We don't really want to bother you.
[03:38:35.136 --> 03:38:36.636]  We don't want to get involved with your business.
[03:38:36.957 --> 03:38:38.878]  You live your life how you want to live your life.
[03:38:39.258 --> 03:38:41.079]  I'll live my life how I want to live my life.
[03:38:41.119 --> 03:38:42.540]  True Americana liberalism.
[03:38:43.060 --> 03:38:49.424]  But because of that, as you said, perhaps we're not the most prepared for a disaster because we're always living our own lives.
[03:38:49.804 --> 03:38:53.526]  So I'm not sure if that's a proper response, but what are your thoughts on that before we take another call?
[03:38:54.461 --> 03:38:57.602]  I think the thing is that we don't stand up for our people.
[03:38:57.802 --> 03:38:59.903]  We aren't helping the people we need to be helping now.
[03:39:00.243 --> 03:39:01.444]  Like the Bundys, for instance.
[03:39:01.884 --> 03:39:05.165]  And Schaefer Cox, who's the one that came up with that solution to reclaiming liberty.
[03:39:05.605 --> 03:39:12.788]  They made up a story against him and railroaded it to the jury and gave him 26 years.
[03:39:13.328 --> 03:39:16.089]  Otherwise, he's sitting in a CMU prison now.
[03:39:16.490 --> 03:39:19.731]  And he has an appeal date on August the 16th and we hope they'll let him go.
[03:39:20.549 --> 03:39:29.872]  We need to stand up for the Bundy's, we need to stand up for people, and we need to get together on a local level just like Schaefer was describing in his solution to reclaiming liberty which is on YouTube.
[03:39:30.432 --> 03:39:36.854]  That people can talk to each other on a local level and decide how they're going to take care of each other.
[03:39:39.555 --> 03:39:42.737]  The solution to reclaiming liberty was the militia.
[03:39:43.078 --> 03:39:43.978]  That was the fourth part.
[03:39:44.919 --> 03:39:50.683]  People need to do what they can do to... Yeah, and I'm pretty sure that's eventually what landed him in jail, was the militia stuff.
[03:39:52.844 --> 03:39:54.746]  If I recall correctly, with Schaefer Cox.
[03:39:54.766 --> 03:39:54.966]  Hello?
[03:39:55.146 --> 03:39:56.146]  Am I still on?
[03:39:56.667 --> 03:40:04.072]  Yeah, I believe it was the militia stuff and the stuff he wanted to organize with the Second Amendment that wound up Schaefer Cox in prison.
[03:40:05.171 --> 03:40:06.334]  No, they made it all up.
[03:40:06.856 --> 03:40:09.664]  It was because of his solution to reclaiming liberty they made
[03:40:10.802 --> 03:40:12.122]  Totally illegal.
[03:40:12.743 --> 03:40:15.884]  The trial was illegal.
[03:40:15.904 --> 03:40:16.984]  Yeah, it's the same thing.
[03:40:18.284 --> 03:40:18.964]  Look, it's sad.
[03:40:19.825 --> 03:40:21.245]  I want justice for Schaefer Cox.
[03:40:21.285 --> 03:40:23.486]  I don't want the Bundys to have their land stolen.
[03:40:23.526 --> 03:40:32.328]  I don't want an Amish farmer who makes a product in his backyard to get hit with some regulation suit and then end up in jail for the rest of his life.
[03:40:32.368 --> 03:40:33.129]  A grandfather.
[03:40:33.709 --> 03:40:36.049]  This is the type of garbage that liberal judges and...
[03:40:39.521 --> 03:40:40.201]  I don't know what to do.
[03:40:40.261 --> 03:40:43.742]  Again, it's like, how can I take care of everything?
[03:40:43.802 --> 03:40:47.464]  How can we be here in Austin and try to take care of every case?
[03:40:47.764 --> 03:40:50.645]  You just gotta mobilize locally, and I guess that's what Margaret is saying.
[03:40:51.105 --> 03:40:51.505]  It sucks.
[03:40:51.545 --> 03:40:52.925]  I wish I could do more for Shaver Cox.
[03:40:52.965 --> 03:40:54.166]  I wish I could do more for the Bundys.
[03:40:55.206 --> 03:40:59.648]  Um, you know, but here we are trying to keep Trump from getting ousted from office, our elected president.
[03:40:59.689 --> 03:41:00.569]  Yeah, it's all crazy.
[03:41:00.789 --> 03:41:05.391]  It's literally just a cyclone of, uh, of madness here in America.
[03:41:05.432 --> 03:41:06.452]  Thank you for the call, Margaret.
[03:41:06.912 --> 03:41:08.913]  Let's go to John in Wisconsin.
[03:41:08.953 --> 03:41:11.455]  What do you think would happen if Trump is removed from office?
[03:41:11.495 --> 03:41:12.095]  Go ahead, John.
[03:41:12.115 --> 03:41:18.058]  Well, uh, first of all, I want to say about Margaret, uh, and all this stuff.
[03:41:18.078 --> 03:41:23.341]  There was a, um, lawgiver that, uh, was suggesting that they put a,
[03:41:26.862 --> 03:41:41.666]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[03:41:41.726 --> 03:41:45.568]  If I recall correctly, it was Second Amendment stuff, malicious stuff that wound Schaefer Cox in prison.
[03:41:45.608 --> 03:41:47.308]  Folks can look up Schaefer Cox for themselves.
[03:41:47.328 --> 03:41:49.789]  But what do you think would happen if Trump got removed from office, John?
[03:41:51.049 --> 03:41:52.790]  Well, there's one thing you've got to remember.
[03:41:53.829 --> 03:41:56.631]  How many ex-military people you got in this country?
[03:41:58.412 --> 03:42:00.993]  15 million people that are armed and know how to use weapons?
[03:42:01.173 --> 03:42:04.695]  If they're an oath keeper, they will say yes.
[03:42:06.336 --> 03:42:11.019]  So if they're called upon and things go down to where they have to act, they will act.
[03:42:12.560 --> 03:42:15.922]  And the perpetrators will be rounded up and neutralized.
[03:42:17.522 --> 03:42:18.543]  And they just don't get it.
[03:42:20.664 --> 03:42:21.905]  I think they think they're above it.
[03:42:22.967 --> 03:42:24.847]  They've been wanting this country to collapse.
[03:42:26.268 --> 03:42:37.110]  They can destroy a nation state and destroy the concept of countries being sovereign with big international conglomerates and big international companies and industries and everything.
[03:42:37.130 --> 03:42:38.711]  You know, that's an old story.
[03:42:39.491 --> 03:42:47.152]  But I think they really believe that they're either in enough control that they can be above it or they think they can maybe isolate themselves from it.
[03:42:48.013 --> 03:42:49.213]  Or they think somehow they can
[03:42:50.529 --> 03:42:54.372]  Remove Trump from power and avoid the backlash that is inevitable.
[03:42:55.053 --> 03:42:56.193]  But you're 100% right.
[03:42:56.614 --> 03:43:06.201]  This isn't going to be like Venezuela, where it's just, unfortunately for the Venezuelans, just unarmed people marching in the street that can't do anything.
[03:43:06.361 --> 03:43:10.605]  I mean, they have to throw rocks, they have to throw homemade fireworks, you know, they can't do anything.
[03:43:10.625 --> 03:43:12.987]  And then President Maduro of Venezuela basically
[03:43:14.298 --> 03:43:19.661]  Putting out a new threat like... I mean, they're gonna get even tougher on these protesters, so... But that's not the case!
[03:43:19.841 --> 03:43:20.581]  And here's the other thing!
[03:43:23.203 --> 03:43:26.905]  If they think for one second that police...
[03:43:28.458 --> 03:43:34.419]  Or military, or the National Guard, or anybody who's going to enforce martial law after you remove President Trump?
[03:43:34.919 --> 03:43:36.500]  You are out of your mind!
[03:43:36.520 --> 03:43:40.841]  You are out of your mind if you think they're going to go along with that.
[03:43:41.121 --> 03:43:42.001]  Here's what's going to happen.
[03:43:42.021 --> 03:43:46.942]  They're going to say, face those people who are protesting our removal of President Trump.
[03:43:47.162 --> 03:43:49.962]  And then the National Guard will have their weapon, and the police, and they'll be ready.
[03:43:50.222 --> 03:43:57.384]  And then they'll do an about face, and they'll look right at the people that gave them that command and say, no, I think it's time to bring you to justice.
[03:43:58.553 --> 03:43:58.893]  I don't know.
[03:44:00.174 --> 03:44:02.254]  I think that they really think they're either immune or above it.
[03:44:03.195 --> 03:44:05.556]  Let's go to Angie in Alaska.
[03:44:05.636 --> 03:44:09.097]  What do you think will happen if Trump is removed from office?
[03:44:09.137 --> 03:44:09.777]  Go ahead, Angie.
[03:44:09.797 --> 03:44:11.958]  I think it would be civil war.
[03:44:13.319 --> 03:44:15.239]  I think that it would be total chaos.
[03:44:15.439 --> 03:44:16.640]  It already is civil war.
[03:44:16.680 --> 03:44:17.360]  That's the truth.
[03:44:17.400 --> 03:44:18.581]  We're already in a civil war.
[03:44:18.621 --> 03:44:19.241]  We'll go hot.
[03:44:20.515 --> 03:44:24.397]  If they think that the people are going to just lay down and take it, they're sorely mistaken.
[03:44:24.437 --> 03:44:29.999]  And when the gentleman prior to me said, Oath Keepers, they forget we've got Oath Keepers high up.
[03:44:30.319 --> 03:44:33.100]  We have Oath Keepers in our local law enforcement.
[03:44:33.120 --> 03:44:34.481]  We have Oath Keepers with militia.
[03:44:34.521 --> 03:44:38.202]  We have Oath Keepers in our armies and all of our military.
[03:44:38.582 --> 03:44:40.483]  We have Oath Keepers with CIA and FBI.
[03:44:40.583 --> 03:44:42.884]  So I think that they're absolutely nuts.
[03:44:42.944 --> 03:44:44.985]  I think that they will find out real quick.
[03:44:45.612 --> 03:44:47.273]  Yes, they decided to take our president out.
[03:44:47.573 --> 03:44:52.236]  The American people love our president, and we are raising our children to be smarter.
[03:44:52.676 --> 03:44:56.459]  We are raising our grandchildren to be smarter, and they will never shut us down.
[03:44:56.699 --> 03:45:01.122]  Yeah, and keep in mind too, you make a good point with the Oath Keepers, but keep in mind too, folks,
[03:45:01.854 --> 03:45:10.399]  Think about all the Black Ops people that are retired, all the Marine Corps people that are retired, all the military veterans that are retired.
[03:45:10.799 --> 03:45:21.326]  I meet so many of these people when I go out on the road, and some of these people, I mean, these are very able-bodied people that could probably go right into prime shape the next day if they needed to be called to action.
[03:45:22.146 --> 03:45:24.207]  They're not going to lay down their arms!
[03:45:24.407 --> 03:45:29.210]  They're not going to lay down... They literally put their life on the line for this country!
[03:45:29.450 --> 03:45:34.914]  You think they're going to let some snot-nosed Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, piece of crap take the country from them?
[03:45:36.154 --> 03:45:36.795]  You know what's funny?
[03:45:38.255 --> 03:45:45.199]  Nancy Pelosi, in that video that went viral of the guy going up and confronting her... See if you can pull up this video, guys.
[03:45:45.520 --> 03:45:49.322]  The guy goes up and confronts Nancy Pelosi, says, prison time's coming, prison time's coming.
[03:45:50.489 --> 03:45:58.336]  There is a moment after he says that that is illustrative of everything that is the globalist establishment in America right now.
[03:45:59.077 --> 03:46:09.107]  Nancy Pelosi, immediately after confronted with the reality that she's about to face justice, her handler has to take her by the hand and escort her away, folks.
[03:46:10.448 --> 03:46:11.509]  See if you can play this video.
[03:46:12.776 --> 03:46:20.325]  Folks, John McCain, Nancy Pelosi, watch this, she's going to be grabbed, that's her handler, let me take you by the arm Nancy, I got you, I got you.
[03:46:21.146 --> 03:46:30.778]  Folks, these people are so mentally dilapidated, they're so mentally ill, they literally have brain cancer, they literally have mental disorders, they literally have dementia.
[03:46:31.058 --> 03:46:32.239]  This is their establishment.
[03:46:32.460 --> 03:46:35.123]  Or then you have Chuck Schumer, the dirtiest rat.
[03:46:35.503 --> 03:46:40.048]  I read some story today about how there's a new record size of the biggest rats ever in New York City.
[03:46:40.388 --> 03:46:41.830]  Well, they haven't measured Chuck Schumer!
[03:46:41.870 --> 03:46:43.872]  That's the biggest rat in the history of the whole state!
[03:46:44.433 --> 03:46:45.114]  Chuck Schumer!
[03:46:45.915 --> 03:46:52.262]  If you think for one second that pieces of crap like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are gonna have the say,
[03:46:52.862 --> 03:47:01.068]  And are going to force military veterans, Marine Corps veterans, Navy SEAL veterans to lay down their law and just let you take their vote away from them?
[03:47:02.369 --> 03:47:03.090]  Oh my gosh!
[03:47:03.630 --> 03:47:04.631]  It's just ridiculous!
[03:47:05.151 --> 03:47:06.412]  Thank you for the call, Angie.
[03:47:07.053 --> 03:47:09.415]  Let's go to Josh in Oregon.
[03:47:09.735 --> 03:47:11.536]  What do you think would happen if they tried to remove Trump?
[03:47:13.198 --> 03:47:13.978]  Can you hear me?
[03:47:14.438 --> 03:47:14.959]  Yep, go ahead.
[03:47:16.397 --> 03:47:16.697]  Awesome.
[03:47:17.197 --> 03:47:25.559]  So hey, before I do this, I want to say I take the X2 and the Vitamin & Mineral Fusion, and that stuff is a bomb.
[03:47:25.639 --> 03:47:27.020]  And I gotta say, I don't just buy it from them.
[03:47:27.040 --> 03:47:29.700]  I'm a big supporter of you guys, but I definitely don't buy it because of that.
[03:47:30.481 --> 03:47:31.781]  It's the best stuff I've found.
[03:47:31.801 --> 03:47:32.821]  I mean, it's really incredible.
[03:47:33.741 --> 03:47:34.421]  Yeah, it's good stuff.
[03:47:34.482 --> 03:47:35.062]  I use it too.
[03:47:36.482 --> 03:47:38.002]  Yeah, just wanted to give that quick testimony.
[03:47:38.042 --> 03:47:39.743]  But hey, as far as what's going to happen if
[03:47:41.523 --> 03:47:46.425]  If President Trump is taken out of office, I mean, we're all trying to look for a rationale here.
[03:47:46.665 --> 03:47:49.187]  The thing is, these are irrational people at this point.
[03:47:49.227 --> 03:47:53.289]  They're in a corner right now, and they're criminals, and they know they're screwed.
[03:47:53.629 --> 03:47:54.769]  So this is what they have to do.
[03:47:55.169 --> 03:47:56.070]  That is so key.
[03:47:56.190 --> 03:47:57.050]  That is so key.
[03:47:57.090 --> 03:48:06.775]  You cannot, when you're talking to your friends, when you're talking about this stuff, it is so key to understand, Trump is not the one that's cornered, folks.
[03:48:07.938 --> 03:48:09.219]  That's the optics they're pointing.
[03:48:09.239 --> 03:48:12.982]  They're trying to say Trump is cornered, Republicans are cornered, you're cornered, America's cornered.
[03:48:13.362 --> 03:48:13.582]  No.
[03:48:14.123 --> 03:48:15.224]  The globalists are cornered.
[03:48:15.524 --> 03:48:16.585]  The deep state is cornered.
[03:48:16.785 --> 03:48:18.046]  The establishment is cornered.
[03:48:18.286 --> 03:48:18.806]  Obama.
[03:48:19.127 --> 03:48:19.447]  Lynch.
[03:48:19.767 --> 03:48:20.248]  Powers.
[03:48:20.588 --> 03:48:22.169]  They're the ones that are cornered, folks.
[03:48:22.589 --> 03:48:23.990]  They are the cornered rats.
[03:48:24.211 --> 03:48:24.771]  CNN.
[03:48:24.911 --> 03:48:25.572]  Cornered rats.
[03:48:25.612 --> 03:48:32.857]  Like Brian Stelter pretending that McEnany doing a report on news because she likes Trump, it's fake news.
[03:48:33.217 --> 03:48:37.821]  Brian Stelter looks like George Costanza and is about as trustworthy as George Costanza.
[03:48:38.421 --> 03:48:40.342]  These people are a failing joke.
[03:48:40.422 --> 03:48:41.463]  Thank you for the call, Josh.
[03:48:41.483 --> 03:48:43.103]  Let's go to Paul in California.
[03:48:43.443 --> 03:48:45.664]  What do you think will happen if they try to remove Trump from office?
[03:48:47.305 --> 03:48:53.848]  Well, my question is what's going on as far as protecting the President of the United States?
[03:48:54.348 --> 03:49:01.131]  Well, you heard Alex earlier say he's got a special military-type protection team, as well as Secret Service.
[03:49:01.331 --> 03:49:04.753]  So, I mean, anything else, you probably know as much as me.
[03:49:06.454 --> 03:49:15.622]  Okay, well, as far as kicking Trump out, I think the Secret Service needs to do their job, so he's not kicked out.
[03:49:17.023 --> 03:49:26.491]  Well, the Secret Service is not a political wing, so if you're talking about if they physically try to remove him, the Secret Service stepping in, who knows?
[03:49:26.671 --> 03:49:27.652]  Who knows what they can do?
[03:49:28.112 --> 03:49:29.774]  Who knows what they think they can pull off?
[03:49:30.735 --> 03:49:31.375]  It's all insane.
[03:49:31.415 --> 03:49:34.518]  The notion that they think they can remove Trump from office just goes to show...
[03:49:38.385 --> 03:49:41.288]  How many people have been telling you your government has been taken over?
[03:49:41.408 --> 03:49:45.671]  How many years has Alex Jones been telling you the United States government has been infiltrated?
[03:49:45.972 --> 03:49:48.534]  How many times have people told you that the Republic has fallen?
[03:49:48.754 --> 03:49:50.716]  We've been telling you this for years!
[03:49:52.277 --> 03:49:52.878]  Here you are.
[03:49:53.358 --> 03:49:54.199]  Here's the evidence.
[03:49:54.539 --> 03:49:57.421]  It's all happening right now.
[03:49:58.342 --> 03:49:59.203]  Final comment, Paul.
[03:50:01.685 --> 03:50:02.045]  Nothing.
[03:50:02.166 --> 03:50:05.929]  I'm just sad that the president isn't being protected.
[03:50:06.670 --> 03:50:11.137]  Well look, they haven't removed him yet, so I mean... I mean, who knows if he's not being protected?
[03:50:11.157 --> 03:50:16.905]  I mean, you can't say Secret Service is not protecting him, so... But again, who knows what they think they can do?
[03:50:18.327 --> 03:50:18.708]  Who knows?
[03:50:18.768 --> 03:50:19.950]  Maybe they really think that they can...
[03:50:20.928 --> 03:50:21.509]  Impeach him.
[03:50:21.549 --> 03:50:24.671]  Maybe they really think that they can find something to remove him physically.
[03:50:24.711 --> 03:50:25.772]  Maybe they think they can kill him.
[03:50:26.192 --> 03:50:27.273]  I don't know what they think.
[03:50:27.974 --> 03:50:29.315]  But we know what they want to do.
[03:50:29.355 --> 03:50:31.336]  They've made that obvious since day one.
[03:50:32.077 --> 03:50:32.537]  All of them.
[03:50:32.857 --> 03:50:33.558]  In the media.
[03:50:33.778 --> 03:50:34.759]  Pretending to shoot him.
[03:50:35.079 --> 03:50:37.381]  Pretending to have him stabbed at a play in New York.
[03:50:37.721 --> 03:50:38.782]  Pretending to behead him.
[03:50:40.503 --> 03:50:43.445]  He's foisting this Russian probe on us for the last year!
[03:50:43.465 --> 03:50:45.206]  A total canard!
[03:50:45.966 --> 03:50:51.570]  If you want to talk about treason, anybody who's been forcing this Russia thing down our throats ought to be tried for treason.
[03:50:52.330 --> 03:50:52.991]  I'm just done with it.
[03:50:53.211 --> 03:50:57.053]  President Trump, I'm- just start arresting people!
[03:50:57.093 --> 03:50:58.154]  Who cares what they say about you?
[03:50:58.434 --> 03:50:59.855]  They fake beheaded you, Trump!
[03:50:59.875 --> 03:51:00.756]  Just arrest them all!
[03:51:14.036 --> 03:51:15.717]  What are they gearing Antifa up?
[03:51:16.037 --> 03:51:20.799]  Why has Soros doubled the amount of money since Trump was elected in January, since he did previously?
[03:51:21.279 --> 03:51:22.420]  What are they gearing up for?
[03:51:22.460 --> 03:51:23.480]  They're calling for violence.
[03:51:23.500 --> 03:51:24.561]  They're calling for Trump's death.
[03:51:24.941 --> 03:51:26.462]  They're calling for it in mainstream news.
[03:51:27.486 --> 03:51:34.307]  They're calling, whether it's Al Gore or whether it's Clapper and Brennan, they're saying something big is about to happen.
[03:51:34.607 --> 03:51:35.488]  It's not impeachment.
[03:51:35.508 --> 03:51:36.528]  We're going to remove him.
[03:51:36.828 --> 03:51:40.129]  We've got to bipartisanly come together for his removal.
[03:51:40.249 --> 03:51:42.029]  Don't do anything when we remove him.
[03:51:42.549 --> 03:51:44.629]  Suddenly Republican leadership is turning against Trump.
[03:51:45.250 --> 03:51:52.031]  As they raise more money than ever raised, as the Democratic Party is being made extinct, they prepare for the killer blow.
[03:51:52.791 --> 03:51:55.172]  And James Leslie Rawls is our expert to break this down.
[03:51:55.572 --> 03:51:56.733]  Survivalblog.com.
[03:51:56.793 --> 03:52:01.235]  James, this ties into your big lengthy investigative reports.
[03:52:02.095 --> 03:52:05.056]  Antifa Part 1 and 2, the Antifa threat spiral.
[03:52:05.357 --> 03:52:06.337]  Break it down for us.
[03:52:06.637 --> 03:52:08.218]  What are the globalists getting ready to do?
[03:52:09.819 --> 03:52:19.703]  Well Alex, I think it's pretty clear that the Antifa movement is being used as kind of a shock troops for
[03:52:20.695 --> 03:52:23.777]  They're their goal of destabilizing the government.
[03:52:24.218 --> 03:52:33.664]  They want to have a wave of protests and a followed by a wave of domestic terrorism in this country.
[03:52:34.344 --> 03:52:35.685]  They want to destabilize.
[03:52:36.246 --> 03:52:40.769]  They want to try to create a counter
[03:52:41.549 --> 03:52:59.517]  Action by the Trump administration, they're hoping for a Kent State type event, where it would demoralize the American populace, turn the populace against the Trump administration, and part of their overall campaign to get Trump out of office.
[03:53:01.658 --> 03:53:07.041]  And I think that if you look at Antifa, how they were set up,
[03:53:08.267 --> 03:53:12.509]  How they interact between their cells.
[03:53:13.190 --> 03:53:21.534]  It's very similar to what we saw in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the radicalization of the anti-war movement.
[03:53:22.635 --> 03:53:28.518]  And that spun off a number of incredibly radical terrorist groups.
[03:53:29.138 --> 03:53:30.539]  A lot of them were cellular.
[03:53:31.933 --> 03:53:45.478]  There was some interaction between cells and in fact there was some interaction internationally with groups like the PLO and the Red Army Faction in Germany, the Italian Red Brigades and so forth.
[03:53:46.198 --> 03:53:51.260]  I think we're going to see a very similar era here in the United States in the very near future.
[03:54:10.443 --> 03:54:20.924]  You know, if Trump had one-tenth, one-tenth, in fact, if Trump had one-one-hundredth of the controversial track record of a Loretta Lynch, a James Comey, an H.R.
[03:54:20.944 --> 03:54:28.646]  McMaster, a Hillary Clinton, a John Podesta, a John McCain, they would have not even let him run for president.
[03:54:28.946 --> 03:54:30.086]  They might have done a public lynching.
[03:54:31.192 --> 03:54:36.541]  But no, the Democrats are allowed to have all the collusion, collude with whoever they want, sell security secrets to anybody.
[03:54:36.561 --> 03:54:39.847]  The Clintons can sell secrets to the Chinese, who sell them to North Korea, who now may nuke us.
[03:54:40.949 --> 03:54:42.291]  No, no, it's all Trump, folks.
[03:54:43.653 --> 03:54:44.916]  It's all Trump.
[03:54:46.325 --> 03:54:48.026]  We got the nightly news tonight, 7 p.m.

[03:55:41.618 --> 03:55:42.178]  Hey, have you heard?
[03:55:46.021 --> 03:55:53.865]  We knew this was coming, but now you've got the cities fighting back against President Trump trying to cut funding to sanctuary cities.
[03:55:54.385 --> 03:55:57.146]  So let's look at Chicago with Rahm Emanuel.
[03:55:58.246 --> 03:56:04.649]  Chicago is now thinking about suing the federal government over the threat to cut their federal funding.
[03:56:05.130 --> 03:56:06.430]  This is hilarious, folks.
[03:56:06.650 --> 03:56:08.451]  This is the Democrat Party.
[03:56:08.691 --> 03:56:11.012]  This is the liberals in a nutshell.
[03:56:11.252 --> 03:56:14.554]  You need look no further than this story right here.
[03:56:15.962 --> 03:56:19.404]  What are the entrails of this story?
[03:56:19.444 --> 03:56:22.046]  So, the federal government says, we're going to cut your funding.
[03:56:22.066 --> 03:56:25.908]  We're going to cut your federal funding if you're here taking care of non-citizens.
[03:56:26.408 --> 03:56:30.130]  See, we have this crazy new idea of putting America first in America.
[03:56:30.771 --> 03:56:35.653]  So, if you're not going to do that in your cities, Chicago, well then we're going to cut your federal funds.
[03:56:35.713 --> 03:56:39.716]  So, the federal government says, we're not going to give you this money to fund your police.
[03:56:40.600 --> 03:56:41.261]  In Chicago.
[03:56:41.861 --> 03:56:44.103]  So what is the response from Chicago?
[03:56:44.143 --> 03:56:46.965]  They say, well how dare you attack our police!
[03:56:47.485 --> 03:56:50.087]  How dare you come after our police like that!
[03:56:50.468 --> 03:56:51.588]  We're gonna sue you!
[03:56:51.609 --> 03:56:53.990]  No folks, you know what this is?
[03:56:55.051 --> 03:56:56.312]  This is Rahm Emanuel.
[03:56:56.873 --> 03:57:01.236]  This is the Democrat establishment in Chicago putting non-citizens above police.
[03:57:01.796 --> 03:57:02.557]  That's what this is.
[03:57:03.057 --> 03:57:08.421]  They would rather sue the federal government than have their police officers taken care of.
[03:57:08.922 --> 03:57:10.103]  This is the same city
[03:57:11.459 --> 03:57:16.802]  That has no gun policies, strict gun laws, over 400 homicides this year!
[03:57:19.363 --> 03:57:25.326]  So, you want to look at how liberals' priorities rank, and what happens in liberal cities?
[03:57:25.566 --> 03:57:34.410]  Look no further than Chicago, where they put non-citizens, non-Americans, illegal non-citizens, lawbreakers, above police officers.
[03:57:35.631 --> 03:57:39.133]  A city where they continue to crack down with gun legislation,
[03:57:40.151 --> 03:57:43.173]  Yet have multiple homicides every weekend.
[03:57:45.094 --> 03:57:45.795]  So that's nice.
[03:57:46.215 --> 03:57:47.536]  Good for you, Rahm Emanuel.
[03:57:47.876 --> 03:57:49.237]  Glad to know where you stand.
[03:57:49.617 --> 03:57:53.540]  Non-citizens are more important than police officers in Chicago.
[03:57:53.700 --> 03:57:55.161]  You know what I would do if I was Chicago police?
[03:57:55.281 --> 03:57:56.982]  You know, this is where we need to start happening, folks.
[03:57:57.882 --> 03:58:03.426]  The police union or whoever it is for the Chicago police needs to take a stand now and need to say, you know what, Rahm Emanuel?
[03:58:04.420 --> 03:58:11.845]  You could get the funding if you would quit funding the non-citizens, but because you won't, we're not going to provide security for you anymore.
[03:58:12.966 --> 03:58:15.267]  Wonder what would happen to Rahm Emanuel then.
[03:58:15.668 --> 03:58:31.678]  Wonder what a Rahm Emanuel would do if the police said, sorry Rahm, we want to be putting ahead of non-citizens, so you go ahead and do your little lawsuit, but you're not going to have any protection going to court, you're not going to have any protection going to your mansion, you're not going to have any protection going to work.
[03:58:32.139 --> 03:58:33.900]  How do you think Rahm Emanuel would respond to that?
[03:58:34.360 --> 03:58:36.422]  Yeah, and he doesn't have guns to protect him anymore either.
[03:58:36.442 --> 03:58:39.305]  Thanks for tuning into the InfoWars Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:39.806 --> 03:58:41.988]  Tune in to the nightly news tonight, 7 p.m.

[03:58:45.492 --> 03:58:49.476]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.658 --> 03:58:54.999]  Why is the fungus?
[03:58:55.079 --> 03:58:56.040]  Why is the mold?
[03:58:56.160 --> 03:58:57.601]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[03:58:57.901 --> 03:58:58.721]  What is going on?
[03:58:58.882 --> 03:58:59.622]  What has changed?
[03:59:23.918 --> 03:59:25.318]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[03:59:25.338 --> 03:59:27.319]  I want to get your reviews on here, what you have to say.
[03:59:27.339 --> 03:59:28.199]  For me, it's been incredible.

[03:59:44.042 --> 03:59:46.342]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[03:59:46.362 --> 03:59:47.802]  Look at the response we're getting.
[03:59:48.242 --> 03:59:49.663]  We're changing the world together.
[03:59:49.723 --> 03:59:50.683]  You are the InfoWar.
[03:59:50.723 --> 03:59:51.483]  God bless you all.
[03:59:55.652 --> 03:59:59.735]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
