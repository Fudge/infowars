[00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:11.305]  Big Brother.
[00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:13.928]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.571]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:17.953 --> 00:00:18.994]  Do you want answers?
[00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:20.976]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.857 --> 00:00:28.164]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.104 --> 00:00:33.206]  It is Sunday, the 22nd day of October 2017.
[00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:37.851]  We're going to be live here as we are each Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:38.271]  Central.
[00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:40.393]  Then, Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:41.895]  Central, at 3 p.m.
[00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:51.844]  with the Alex Jones Show, with yours truly, don't forget, David Knight kicks it all off here with our live broadcast on radio and TV, simulcast at 8 a.m.
[00:00:51.864 --> 00:00:54.487]  in the morning, and then my broadcast is followed at 3 p.m.
[00:00:54.527 --> 00:00:55.528]  by The War Room with Owen Schroer.
[00:00:57.526 --> 00:01:05.410]  Man, Vegas is definitely a cover-up of multiple shooters, just like my sources in the FBI said when the bodies weren't even cold, sadly, three weeks ago.
[00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.631]  That's all coming out.
[00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.653]  Vegas bombshell video shows 17 ambulances pulling bodies out of Hooters.
[00:01:11.153 --> 00:01:12.574]  I mean, there were shootings all over.
[00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:13.775]  The real numbers are being covered up.
[00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:19.778]  DARPA's come out and admitted at the World Economic Forum they can mind-control you with waves from a distance.
[00:01:19.818 --> 00:01:20.518]  That's coming up.
[00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.899]  And so much more.
[00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:23.260]  Trump's got the globalists on the run.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.741]  But first, a key
[00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:30.265]  Report, ladies and gentlemen, dealing with convicted pedophiles still working in Hollywood.
[00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:41.853]  At this very moment, a convicted child molester is in close proximity to child actors directing them in a fantasy of his own making.
[00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:51.680]  This idea about a boy who could touch people and see how they die and how it would affect his life and how it was a mystery to him most of his life.
[00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:58.707]  And I thought, well why don't we let him find out why and let it be the most awful thing he should have never found out to begin with.
[00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:00.348]  So we kind of just ran with it like that.
[00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:07.695]  A product of Miramax and Disney, praised and supported by film industry icons like Francis Ford Coppola.
[00:02:07.975 --> 00:02:13.719]  Victor Salva was convicted of molesting the star of his debut movie, Clown House, back in 1988.
[00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:21.664]  The actor, speaking of his abuse, Nathan Forrest Winters said of Salva, It was very calculated and a long process, as it is with most pedophiles.
[00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:37.494]  Regardless that Salva spent three years in prison for the molestation, his career resumed after he was released.
[00:02:37.674 --> 00:02:49.001]  In a recent film of Salva's titled Jeepers Creepers 3, Salva even wrote a scene in normalizing the sexual abuse between a stepfather and his stepdaughter.
[00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:56.646]  Salva's latest film, Old Hag Syndrome, is described as a psychological thriller centered around the nightmares of children.
[00:02:56.706 --> 00:02:57.787]  Kit Daniels writes,
[00:02:57.987 --> 00:03:09.914]  Not long after the Walt Disney Company bought Bob and Harvey Weinstein's company Miramax in 1993, convicted child molester Victor Salva was pegged to direct Disney's film Powder.
[00:03:10.134 --> 00:03:19.559]  This is important to note because Disney now faces potential lawsuits for doing nothing about Harvey Weinstein's alleged predatory behavior.
[00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:26.202]  If Disney knew or had reason to know and Weinstein stayed on with Disney to helm Miramax until 2005.
[00:03:27.383 --> 00:03:35.285]  The LA Times reported on October 31st, 1995, as controversy swirled around filmmaker Victor Salva.
[00:03:35.405 --> 00:03:42.147]  Salva's agents said that a good showing at the box office may salvage the 37-year-old director's career.
[00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:44.728]  At least three studios are meeting with him.
[00:03:44.928 --> 00:03:47.329]  One has already given Victor scripts to read.
[00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:55.651]  Three studios had no problem hiring a convicted child molester as long as he produced a good showing at the box office.
[00:03:55.951 --> 00:04:01.798]  Is it any surprise, then, how Weinstein was able to get away with his reported behavior for decades?
[00:04:02.198 --> 00:04:15.293]  Meanwhile, Harvey Weinstein, according to Page Six, is arriving to his group therapy sessions 15 minutes late, and when it was his turn to speak, launched into a speech about how this is all a conspiracy against him.
[00:04:15.974 --> 00:04:24.947]  In related Hollywood implosion news, Jeff Bezos had known for two years about ousted Amazon Studios chief Roy Price's behavior.
[00:04:25.367 --> 00:04:31.216]  On top of Price's sexual power trips, he was also trying to get his own sketchy show off the ground.
[00:04:31.596 --> 00:04:44.442]  About a young woman who is sold into sex slavery to a psychotic imperial Thai dwarf named Mr. Goodtimes, where she is drugged, bashed with a machete, and told she will be assaulted like a dead fish.
[00:04:44.842 --> 00:04:50.605]  Is it just me or does it seem like Hollywood should be injected with a huge dose of penicillin?
[00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:56.708]  Seven black athletes and one white guy, James Toback, with 15 to 20 girls a day in and out of the house.
[00:04:57.068 --> 00:04:58.669]  Pre-AIDS era, I should add.
[00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.290]  Everybody going crazy.
[00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.830]  No one ever forced to do anything.
[00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:02.531]  We'll be back, folks.
[00:05:02.571 --> 00:05:03.011]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.231]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:15.692]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:05:16.312 --> 00:05:24.714]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:05:24.954 --> 00:05:31.535]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water,
[00:05:31.835 --> 00:05:38.778]  To the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:05:39.198 --> 00:05:42.419]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:53.643]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:05:53.763 --> 00:05:56.403]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[00:05:56.624 --> 00:05:59.604]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[00:05:59.724 --> 00:06:02.705]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[00:06:11.426 --> 00:06:13.506]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:17.647]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:17.787 --> 00:06:21.448]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:40.141]  The 22nd day of October 2017, year of our Lord.
[00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:43.802]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday edition.
[00:06:44.663 --> 00:06:46.903]  I'm here each Sunday live at 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:47.003 --> 00:06:53.466]  Central with our intrepid crew because there's so much news that develops Saturday into Sunday as we kick off the new week.
[00:06:54.026 --> 00:06:56.127]  Then of course there's the weekday transmission 11 a.m.
[00:06:56.267 --> 00:06:56.947]  to 3 p.m.
[00:06:57.347 --> 00:06:59.148]  All Times Texas, All Times Central.
[00:06:59.488 --> 00:07:01.989]  That's 12 noon Eastern when we kick off the transmission.
[00:07:04.031 --> 00:07:06.932]  Newswars.com is our newest site.
[00:07:07.292 --> 00:07:09.612]  And of course, Infowars.com is the flagship.
[00:07:09.972 --> 00:07:19.814]  But there's a lot of original news and videos and articles and research that appear at Newswars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that do not appear at Infowars.com.
[00:07:19.834 --> 00:07:25.255]  And the globalists are working around the clock, admittedly, to make sure that people don't see those links and see those videos.
[00:07:25.715 --> 00:07:33.397]  We have the head of YouTube's programming, the head of their liaison with the mainstream media, admitting their main mission was blocking Infowars.
[00:07:34.482 --> 00:07:37.743]  I mean, I don't need that undercover video from Veritas to already know that.
[00:07:38.183 --> 00:07:52.588]  If we have a video with a million views in one day, and I go to the trending section, and they've got videos with 20,000 views in one day, or 100,000 in one day, that are at the top of the list, you know the list is fake.
[00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:56.970]  You know they're acting like there's a you in YouTube.
[00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:03.132]  The reason I raise that is the gaming is all around us, but despite that, they're losing.
[00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:04.257]  Look at this!
[00:08:05.557 --> 00:08:23.000]  Jimmy Carter has come out and said that Trump's doing a good job on the economy and many other areas and said that Hillary and the Clintons and Obama have done a terrible job and that they have basically lied about the Russia connection to Trump and are trying to throw America under the bus.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:32.862]  Now, Jimmy Carter, ladies and gentlemen, did that after he went to that fundraiser at College Station Friday night with four other presidents.
[00:08:34.591 --> 00:08:41.378]  And reportedly there was a lot of bad-mouthing of the president, the current president, on and off the stage.
[00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:42.720]  We've got some of that coming up.
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:48.245]  And so Carter has made his decision to go with making America great again.
[00:08:49.284 --> 00:08:50.585]  There in his twilight years.
[00:08:50.605 --> 00:08:51.565]  And I've seen him give speeches.
[00:08:51.585 --> 00:08:52.586]  He's still all there.
[00:08:52.946 --> 00:08:53.967]  He's got his problems.
[00:08:54.927 --> 00:08:57.308]  And definitely sold us out to Communist Chinese and other things.
[00:08:57.368 --> 00:09:01.931]  But the fact is that I think he knows when to jump ship, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:02.711 --> 00:09:03.932]  So we've got that big news.
[00:09:03.992 --> 00:09:10.235]  Jimmy Carter lets loose, knocks Obama and Hillary, says Russia didn't alter election, praises Trump.
[00:09:10.696 --> 00:09:11.436]  That's coming up.
[00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:25.253]  Victor Salva is in the news because he was hired by Harry Weinstein even though he was convicted of raping a 12-year-old boy brutally on the set and other reported crimes he was alleged to have committed.
[00:09:26.154 --> 00:09:28.415]  Now that's back in the news, but guess what?
[00:09:28.495 --> 00:09:30.676]  Corey Feldman, the big child actor,
[00:09:31.756 --> 00:09:33.818]  He was set this week to go public.
[00:09:34.118 --> 00:09:42.446]  In fact, he went on The View and said that he was about to go public about young boys being raped by men in Hollywood, big directors and producers and lawyers.
[00:09:42.927 --> 00:09:47.611]  He got SWAT team raided yesterday in a supposed drug raid.
[00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:49.953]  Isn't that convenient timing?
[00:09:50.834 --> 00:09:52.715]  As the Deep State clearly strikes back.
[00:09:52.935 --> 00:09:54.035]  Oh, and there's another report.
[00:09:54.796 --> 00:10:00.998]  Alleged pedo, Peter Yarrow, to perform at Women for Peace rally outside the Pentagon.
[00:10:01.498 --> 00:10:07.560]  Washington's Free Beacon is reporting as pedo-gate continues to break big time.
[00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:14.703]  That is the next shoe to drop on the sexual assault reports pouring out of California.
[00:10:15.363 --> 00:10:19.165]  Now, speaking of Trump and the Global Awakening,
[00:10:21.155 --> 00:10:38.349]  When you have the entire mainstream media, and all these foreign governments, and all these communist states, and all these authoritarian media combines, and Silicon Valley, the big tech companies, when you've got the big internet companies, all of them lined up against the American people.
[00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:49.438]  All of them lined up trying to force their globalist agenda to transfer our national sovereignty out of the country,
[00:10:51.078 --> 00:10:54.240]  And to unelected multinational secret boards.
[00:10:54.981 --> 00:10:56.762]  And the agreements are even secret.
[00:10:57.222 --> 00:11:03.166]  But then WikiLeaks leaks them and it's more authoritarian than you could ever imagine.
[00:11:04.046 --> 00:11:05.147]  Congress couldn't even see it.
[00:11:06.268 --> 00:11:09.050]  Trump comes in and kills TPP day one.
[00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.491]  That was designed to impoverish the U.S.
[00:11:11.531 --> 00:11:12.872]  and transfer our wealth offshore.
[00:11:12.892 --> 00:11:13.853]  It was even in the documents.
[00:11:15.154 --> 00:11:16.434]  It's not that he's an angel.
[00:11:16.795 --> 00:11:18.476]  He's just not an SOB.
[00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:21.345]  Who wants to mount America's head on the wall?
[00:11:22.245 --> 00:11:23.025]  And that's his crime.
[00:11:23.845 --> 00:11:27.747]  And I saw a bunch of articles over the weekend attacking General Kelly.
[00:11:28.427 --> 00:11:31.768]  I'm going to cover these towards the end of the broadcast today, but there's several segments on it.
[00:11:33.188 --> 00:11:37.630]  When he came out, and I've been critical of some of Kelly, kind of cloistering or
[00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:43.461]  Putting the President in a high tower and restricting what info gets to him.
[00:11:43.721 --> 00:11:45.363]  But I understand they call that command and control.
[00:11:45.843 --> 00:11:54.290]  But he came out with this whole Frederica Wilson Congresswoman debacle and said, I've listened in on these phone calls of the President and they're very, very powerful.
[00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.251]  They're very, very loving.
[00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:57.773]  They're very, very courage-filled.
[00:11:57.793 --> 00:11:58.874]  They're very, very helpful.
[00:11:59.275 --> 00:12:02.217]  And basically, I coach the President on what to say.
[00:12:03.618 --> 00:12:09.103]  The Congresswoman came out and called him a racist for saying she was stupid.
[00:12:10.359 --> 00:12:12.500]  No, she is stupid and opportunistic.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.501]  She's on CNN calling herself a rock star now that she did this.
[00:12:17.442 --> 00:12:19.242]  Grabbing on to these hearse.
[00:12:19.863 --> 00:12:21.703]  Grabbing on to these coffins.
[00:12:22.143 --> 00:12:23.684]  Grabbing on to these funerals.
[00:12:24.404 --> 00:12:26.925]  Grabbing on to the telephones, listening to private conversations.
[00:12:27.425 --> 00:12:30.486]  Inserting herself, running to people's houses.
[00:12:31.127 --> 00:12:37.309]  As soon as she hears that their husband's died, she knows that call from the president's coming, so she can get in the middle of it.
[00:12:39.431 --> 00:12:41.673]  That isn't just stupid, that's pig-like.
[00:12:42.253 --> 00:12:44.295]  And I love how she wears that big blue cowboy hat.
[00:12:44.695 --> 00:12:50.619]  And Huckabee Sanders, White House Press Secretary, White House Press Spokeswoman, said, uh, all hat and no cattle.
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.282]  And I saw the GIF going around on, I retweeted it at Real Alex Jones.
[00:12:54.822 --> 00:12:56.804]  It was also on James Woods' Twitter.
[00:12:57.284 --> 00:13:00.006]  And it was, uh, all hat and no cattle.
[00:13:00.046 --> 00:13:01.267]  It was cowboys and Indians.
[00:13:01.727 --> 00:13:04.830]  And it's her with Congresswoman Senator Warren.
[00:13:06.092 --> 00:13:11.253]  As Pocahontas with a little feather in her little headdress like Pocahontas.
[00:13:12.434 --> 00:13:13.714]  I mean, this is next level.
[00:13:14.034 --> 00:13:15.854]  But again, why are they so scared?
[00:13:15.914 --> 00:13:16.695]  What are they pushing?
[00:13:16.735 --> 00:13:17.395]  What are they doing?
[00:13:19.075 --> 00:13:22.356]  They know we have a 3.1% growth rate, something Obama never had.
[00:13:22.796 --> 00:13:24.636]  They know they're creating a controlled economy.
[00:13:24.956 --> 00:13:27.557]  They know they're at odds with an American free market system.
[00:13:28.317 --> 00:13:29.858]  They know they want to show up the market.
[00:13:30.818 --> 00:13:33.478]  And they know Trump is bringing that system back.
[00:13:33.538 --> 00:13:35.319]  So they are panicking.
[00:13:36.175 --> 00:13:38.377]  Trump's very close to getting big tax cuts.
[00:13:38.837 --> 00:13:42.259]  They're saying that will create 7% growth rate.
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:44.681]  Ladies and gentlemen, we haven't had that since the 60s.
[00:13:45.061 --> 00:13:52.066]  China has enjoyed 8 to 15% growth rates for 50 years since the globalists sold us out to them.
[00:13:53.087 --> 00:13:55.629]  So if they can have 10% growth rates on average,
[00:13:56.676 --> 00:14:00.298]  We can have a 7% growth rate and that will pay off the debt.
[00:14:00.778 --> 00:14:04.200]  Only booms pay off debts when you freeze spending.
[00:14:04.441 --> 00:14:06.722]  Can still stay where it is at skyrocket levels.
[00:14:07.671 --> 00:14:16.276]  But every mainline economist even admits the only way to break these things back is to massively cut taxes to the poor people, middle class, cut the corporate tax.
[00:14:16.516 --> 00:14:20.179]  We have the highest in the world written to make it prohibitive to have jobs here.
[00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:21.019]  This is a plan.
[00:14:21.539 --> 00:14:22.680]  They brag about it in WikiLeaks.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:23.361]  It's all public.
[00:14:23.701 --> 00:14:24.381]  It's globalism.
[00:14:24.861 --> 00:14:25.842]  Picking and choosing winners.
[00:14:26.622 --> 00:14:28.404]  And to just rev up that economy
[00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:36.895]  Have massive tax receipts come in, because if you cut taxes, more money comes in because the economy speeds up every time, and then start paying down that debt.
[00:14:37.295 --> 00:14:43.063]  And Trump intends to try to keep spending where it is, and then bring in those tax cuts.
[00:14:43.484 --> 00:14:44.125]  We get that?
[00:14:45.421 --> 00:14:47.682]  We keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates too much?
[00:14:48.122 --> 00:14:53.464]  We will fix the global economy, not just ours, because it's easy to fix.
[00:14:53.844 --> 00:14:54.644]  We have exuberance.
[00:14:54.664 --> 00:14:55.424]  We have technology.
[00:14:55.685 --> 00:14:56.565]  We have machines.
[00:14:56.865 --> 00:14:59.206]  We have the super-industrial high-tech revolution.
[00:14:59.446 --> 00:15:00.566]  We have incredible innovation.
[00:15:00.606 --> 00:15:08.369]  The globalists admit they're trying to, quote, keep things from overheating in the economy, because they want a controlled economy that they manage.
[00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:11.710]  And I know I beat this horse a lot, because it's not a dead horse.
[00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.271]  And it's the horse we're going to ride out of the New World Order on.
[00:15:15.731 --> 00:15:17.832]  So that's why they're so against the Trump agenda.
[00:15:18.552 --> 00:15:21.233]  And that's why Maxine Waters says, quote, we will take him out.
[00:15:21.734 --> 00:15:23.194]  That's a new video coming up next segment.
[00:15:23.694 --> 00:15:26.015]  That's why the BBC jokes about him getting killed.
[00:15:26.836 --> 00:15:31.878]  It's why a lot of media said, oh yeah, what are you going to release the JFK files before we kill you?
[00:15:33.188 --> 00:15:34.188]  Joe Rogan made that point.
[00:15:34.208 --> 00:15:37.009]  He said, yeah, it's a smart thing to do because they're trying to kill him.
[00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:39.890]  I'm going to play that clip from Joe Rogan as well coming up.
[00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.731]  But, of course, we told you on Friday that he was set to release him.
[00:15:44.072 --> 00:15:47.293]  He was looking to release him, he told InfoWars reporter Roger Stone.
[00:15:47.653 --> 00:15:49.913]  The media said we were wrong on Friday, that we wouldn't do it.
[00:15:50.213 --> 00:15:54.955]  But he tweeted on Saturday morning that, barring new information, he'll release him next Friday.
[00:15:55.595 --> 00:16:00.817]  Get next week, next year's or next decade's news here first at InfoWars.
[00:16:02.515 --> 00:16:11.518]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:16:11.598 --> 00:16:19.701]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:24.703]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:16:24.864 --> 00:16:31.587]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:16:31.667 --> 00:16:38.750]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:16:38.851 --> 00:16:45.694]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:16:45.854 --> 00:16:50.196]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:16:50.336 --> 00:16:53.598]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:16:53.738 --> 00:16:59.861]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:02.502]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:17:02.662 --> 00:17:06.865]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.
[00:17:07.405 --> 00:17:11.347]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.

[00:17:31.033 --> 00:17:35.934]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols,
[00:17:36.474 --> 00:17:37.354]  We're good.
[00:18:01.983 --> 00:18:06.485]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[00:18:14.268 --> 00:18:18.230]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:24.472]  Pair this groundbreaking toothpaste with the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and supercharge your oral health.
[00:18:24.652 --> 00:18:31.015]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[00:18:31.255 --> 00:18:41.379]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[00:18:41.619 --> 00:18:48.045]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[00:18:48.406 --> 00:18:51.028]  Xylitol, Nano-Silver, and Iodine.
[00:18:51.289 --> 00:18:54.612]  Notice the difference with our Super Blue Fluoride-Free products.
[00:18:54.892 --> 00:18:59.817]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:18:59.897 --> 00:19:01.799]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:19:02.159 --> 00:19:05.683]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:19:06.143 --> 00:19:12.190]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:15.393]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:15.774 --> 00:19:18.797]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:19:18.977 --> 00:19:22.441]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:19:22.781 --> 00:19:23.242]  The left
[00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:24.503]  ...controls culture.
[00:19:24.543 --> 00:19:25.504]  They control arts.
[00:19:25.584 --> 00:19:26.805]  They control entertainment.
[00:19:27.105 --> 00:19:34.192]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:19:34.252 --> 00:19:36.654]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:40.998]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:19:41.058 --> 00:19:43.120]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:49.124]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[00:19:49.365 --> 00:19:55.630]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.391]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:19:57.551 --> 00:19:58.732]  It's available right now.
[00:19:59.052 --> 00:20:01.614]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:08.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:42.853 --> 00:20:48.915]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:20:49.295 --> 00:20:52.776]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:54.717 --> 00:21:11.602]  Every day that we're on, and every day that we have writers reporting for newswars.com and infowars.com, we are breaking original, hard-hitting news on Hollywood pedophilia, being the next shoe to drop
[00:21:12.389 --> 00:21:14.290]  With Harvey Weinstein.
[00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.351]  We told you that a month ago.
[00:21:16.131 --> 00:21:22.255]  Specifically with Jerry Epstein and the Lolita Express and Bill Clinton and his flights on those.
[00:21:22.836 --> 00:21:25.898]  That is in major New York and LA papers this week.
[00:21:28.132 --> 00:21:30.954]  Just Friday, we said that we talked to the President.
[00:21:31.394 --> 00:21:31.955]  Roger did.
[00:21:31.975 --> 00:21:34.316]  Another one of my sources did, very close to me.
[00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:35.637]  Not going to get into that source.
[00:21:36.077 --> 00:21:45.324]  We talked to the President Friday, and the President was strongly looking at it and said, barring any new information from Pompeo, the CIA director,
[00:21:46.284 --> 00:21:47.705]  Uh, that he's going to release it.
[00:21:48.225 --> 00:21:50.686]  And that's what Roger said on Friday.
[00:21:51.347 --> 00:21:52.727]  It's what I said my source said.
[00:21:53.308 --> 00:22:01.432]  And you notice on Saturday morning, the President tweeted that barring any new information, that he was going to release the information next Friday.
[00:22:02.653 --> 00:22:04.574]  Because the President can block the release of it.
[00:22:04.754 --> 00:22:09.316]  And Obama and George Bush did block the last two times they were going to release it.
[00:22:09.696 --> 00:22:11.077]  And boy, do they have to eat crow now.
[00:22:13.274 --> 00:22:15.495]  If you read the New York Times, the Washington Post, the L.A.
[00:22:15.535 --> 00:22:21.978]  Times, the Chicago Tribune, it says that, okay, Roger Stone and Alex Jones broke the information on Friday.
[00:22:23.038 --> 00:22:26.340]  Now, that same day, they all reported that we had made it up.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:38.525]  They said, fake news, Alex Jones had Roger Stone on, and they claim they talked to the president, and they, well, we've talked to our sources, and it's not gonna be released.
[00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:47.592]  Yeah, because Pompeo, who does a pretty good job overall, I actually like a lot of what he's doing, focusing spying on foreign enemies, not the American people.
[00:22:48.763 --> 00:23:02.168]  Not trying to use the CIA as a globalist tool to de-industrialize the nation, but Pompeo has been fighting with the President not to release it, and thought he had the ear of the President, but as of now, it's going to be released, and who knows what's going to be in there.
[00:23:02.648 --> 00:23:14.193]  Some little birds have looked over it, and know what the body of it is, and a lot of it is the information given to the Warren Commission back in the 60s, and the Congressional Commission in the 70s.
[00:23:14.693 --> 00:23:16.594]  Now the Congressional Commission you never hear about.
[00:23:17.332 --> 00:23:25.319]  But it's the one that found that more than one gunman did kill the president, and that he was killed in a conspiracy, probably organized by the CIA.
[00:23:27.461 --> 00:23:31.084]  Don't you wish Jim Mars, the professor who just died a few months ago, was still here?
[00:23:31.624 --> 00:23:34.047]  First guy to ever teach a college course on JFK assassination.
[00:23:34.467 --> 00:23:37.710]  He was a Fort Worth Stark Telegram reporter when that happened.
[00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:39.351]  He was older than he looked!
[00:23:40.032 --> 00:23:42.014]  He was a nice little garden gnome, good friend of mine.
[00:23:42.791 --> 00:23:45.794]  I was literally about to call him up that week to get him back on the show.
[00:23:45.814 --> 00:23:46.915]  I'm like, where's Jim been?
[00:23:46.935 --> 00:23:48.356]  He usually calls him once on the show.
[00:23:48.376 --> 00:23:50.718]  I was telling my producers, let's get him on the next month.
[00:23:51.198 --> 00:23:51.459]  Boom.
[00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:52.680]  I went home that day.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.042]  George Norrie called me and said, don't say this yet.
[00:23:55.082 --> 00:23:56.423]  I just got calls from his family.
[00:23:56.443 --> 00:23:58.185]  He just died minutes ago.
[00:23:58.865 --> 00:24:00.046]  Anyways, good old Jim.
[00:24:00.066 --> 00:24:02.008]  I know he's looking down from heaven.
[00:24:02.048 --> 00:24:03.769]  He knew there was a spiritual thing to this whole deal.
[00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:05.031]  He knew Jack Ruby.
[00:24:06.452 --> 00:24:07.273]  He used to go to the same
[00:24:08.604 --> 00:24:09.005]  Bar!
[00:24:09.025 --> 00:24:12.388]  Now back then it was more classy, it was burlesque, but there was only one in Dallas.
[00:24:13.049 --> 00:24:19.556]  And he was 21, already a reporter on the Crime Beat, and a new old Jack Ruby.
[00:24:19.636 --> 00:24:21.198]  What a storyteller.
[00:24:21.218 --> 00:24:25.382]  He could certainly break down some things.
[00:24:25.402 --> 00:24:28.406]  But I am digressing, getting into old yarns here.
[00:24:30.819 --> 00:24:40.086]  It's twilight zone to imagine, though, that I, in 2017, would have a direct conduit to the President, and that we would be breaking that the JFK files are about to come out.
[00:24:40.827 --> 00:24:48.393]  So, we have a pretty good idea of what's in those files, and we're going to tell you, coming up, at the start of the next hour.
[00:24:48.793 --> 00:24:52.616]  Now, even if I had sources, I wouldn't tell you I got it from classified sources.
[00:24:52.996 --> 00:24:58.901]  I'd just say I have a pretty good idea what is going to be in those files next Friday.
[00:25:02.116 --> 00:25:03.218]  So I'm going to stop right there.
[00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:12.876]  Now, a bunch of publications, including BBC, there's an article up on Infowars.com about this, made jokes about the president.
[00:25:13.988 --> 00:25:18.111]  BBC journalist defends tweet about Trump motorcade after JFK doc announcements.
[00:25:18.571 --> 00:25:24.375]  After announcing the release of documents of the JFK assassination, President Trump goes on an uneventful motor ride.
[00:25:24.755 --> 00:25:30.139]  So they're just making their jokes about him being suicided or assassinated.
[00:25:30.179 --> 00:25:32.640]  Let's play a clip of Off The Rails.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.641]  I don't know who's more senile and batty.
[00:25:36.583 --> 00:25:38.364]  Is it somebody like
[00:25:40.131 --> 00:25:42.252]  The Democrat leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi?
[00:25:42.832 --> 00:25:44.853]  Or is it Maxine Waters?
[00:25:44.873 --> 00:25:49.775]  Because, you know, this other Congresswoman, Frederica Williams, she says, don't call me stupid.
[00:25:49.815 --> 00:25:50.496]  That's racist.
[00:25:51.036 --> 00:25:52.357]  Well, lady, you are stupid.
[00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:53.857]  And you're a jerk and you're a creep.
[00:25:54.117 --> 00:25:55.778]  And you lied about what was in the phone call.
[00:25:55.998 --> 00:25:57.179]  Or you lied about listening in.
[00:25:57.219 --> 00:25:58.399]  Now it turns out you were there.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.780]  And again, you're all hat no cap.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.901]  I don't care if you're black or white.
[00:26:02.421 --> 00:26:03.722]  You're a bunch of crazy old women.
[00:26:03.742 --> 00:26:04.402]  We're tired of you.
[00:26:07.622 --> 00:26:10.604]  Now she demands an apology from Kelly for character assassination.
[00:26:10.904 --> 00:26:12.785]  She keeps wearing that stupid cowboy hat.
[00:26:14.326 --> 00:26:19.389]  I think it's dumb when men that own cattle ranches and 20,000 head wear cowboy hats on TV.
[00:26:20.169 --> 00:26:21.790]  Cowboy hats are out in the sun, woman!
[00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:23.651]  You ever see me wearing a cowboy hat?
[00:26:23.851 --> 00:26:24.752]  And I got cows.
[00:26:25.252 --> 00:26:26.053]  And I got a ranch.
[00:26:27.048 --> 00:26:29.109]  I got a ranch that we got from the Mexicans!
[00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.870]  We paid for it!
[00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:31.391]  You got one of those?
[00:26:31.691 --> 00:26:33.452]  Stop wearing a cowboy hat!
[00:26:33.752 --> 00:26:34.213]  Stop it!
[00:26:34.453 --> 00:26:34.853]  Excuse me.
[00:26:35.133 --> 00:26:42.798]  Let's go ahead and go to a clip of Off The Rails Maxine Waters saying she's... Oh, and by the way, YouTube's been taking this video down everywhere.
[00:26:43.098 --> 00:26:44.299]  Not claiming even copyright.
[00:26:44.339 --> 00:26:46.800]  They just don't want you to see her unhinged.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.241]  Here it is.
[00:26:48.702 --> 00:26:49.142]  Wow.
[00:26:50.603 --> 00:26:53.245]  What a moving evening this is.
[00:26:55.406 --> 00:27:05.477]  I am sitting here, listening, watching, absorbing, thinking about Ali, even though I never met him.
[00:27:06.197 --> 00:27:11.483]  And with this kind of inspiration, I will go and take Trump out tonight.
[00:27:13.246 --> 00:27:14.728]  I will go and take him out tonight.
[00:27:14.768 --> 00:27:17.030]  That's definitely the tenor, you know, hashtag hunt Republicans.
[00:27:17.531 --> 00:27:20.955]  Now, they claim we're the ones that are calling for violence.
[00:27:21.015 --> 00:27:23.638]  Let's go ahead now, clear shades of violence there.
[00:27:23.898 --> 00:27:27.922]  Let's play Joe Rogan making his point that he thinks Trump's smart to do this, and I agree.
[00:27:27.942 --> 00:27:28.243]  Here it is.
[00:27:28.834 --> 00:27:31.355]  Do you hear that Donald Trump's going to open up the JFK dump?
[00:27:31.736 --> 00:27:32.296]  How about that?
[00:27:32.616 --> 00:27:37.238]  All the dump of documents from the JFK that have been sealed up by all the other presidents?
[00:27:37.579 --> 00:27:39.960]  Like the JFK assassination investigation?
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.502]  They sealed some documents up because they're too sensitive.
[00:27:43.702 --> 00:27:44.022]  I know.
[00:27:44.042 --> 00:27:45.443]  Like whatever those documents are.
[00:27:45.463 --> 00:27:46.983]  Why wouldn't they shred those documents?
[00:27:47.344 --> 00:27:47.744]  I don't know.
[00:27:48.004 --> 00:27:49.385]  Why would damning...
[00:27:50.225 --> 00:27:51.345]  He killed TPP!
[00:28:14.255 --> 00:28:15.156]  You've got the taxes.
[00:28:15.176 --> 00:28:17.197]  But there's not enough time in the world to focus on any of those things.
[00:28:17.217 --> 00:28:17.358]  I agree.
[00:28:17.378 --> 00:28:18.979]  You know what he should focus on?
[00:28:19.019 --> 00:28:20.940]  Donald Trump should focus on the Vegas shooting.
[00:28:21.381 --> 00:28:22.422]  He hasn't said s*** about it.
[00:28:23.422 --> 00:28:24.283]  That's how we're ending it.
[00:28:24.443 --> 00:28:25.424]  You know what I mean?
[00:28:25.444 --> 00:28:26.485]  Eddie Bravo's got a good point.
[00:28:26.525 --> 00:28:28.206]  You think there was some shady s*** going on?
[00:28:28.346 --> 00:28:31.089]  But here's the thing about this Kennedy assassination.
[00:28:31.449 --> 00:28:35.912]  One of the reasons why if I was him, I would focus on the Kennedy assassination is they might f***ing kill him.
[00:28:36.773 --> 00:28:40.196]  Like it's entirely possible that he's thinking that he could get assassinated.
[00:28:40.216 --> 00:28:40.196]  100%.
[00:28:40.876 --> 00:28:42.918]  100%.
[00:28:41.857 --> 00:28:42.918]  You don't make people want to kill him.
[00:28:42.958 --> 00:28:43.819]  Maybe that's why he's opening it.
[00:28:45.161 --> 00:28:46.441]  I wouldn't think there was any files.
[00:28:46.602 --> 00:28:47.822]  Why would those files exist?
[00:28:47.963 --> 00:28:49.404]  They should have been burned a long time ago.
[00:28:49.424 --> 00:28:52.106]  By the way, I'm going to answer that question when we come back for Eddie Bravo.
[00:28:52.286 --> 00:28:55.608]  And I'm going to get into the latest bombshell, Vegas Info.
[00:28:55.848 --> 00:29:00.311]  They got 10, 15 ambulances or more picking up people at another building that have been shot.
[00:29:00.331 --> 00:29:00.932]  We got video.
[00:29:02.873 --> 00:29:07.677]  I have promoted and sold hundreds of great products in my 22 years on air.
[00:29:08.647 --> 00:29:11.809]  This one right here is in the top three.
[00:29:12.209 --> 00:29:13.350]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:19.913]  You can buy filters similar to this one for $500 to $600 that are three-stage.
[00:29:21.654 --> 00:29:33.221]  Alexa Pure Breeze is $200, has a four-filter system, including ion, cluster, charcoal, and more.
[00:29:34.784 --> 00:29:40.950]  That is completely game-changing and costs less than half of leading competitors.
[00:29:41.871 --> 00:29:43.312]  And when you look at the specs...
[00:29:44.386 --> 00:29:45.286]  It's just amazing.
[00:29:45.426 --> 00:29:54.351]  When you first turn it on in a room, it's red, meaning it's picking up particulate, it's picking up pathogens, it's picking up gases, it's picking up toxins.
[00:29:54.731 --> 00:30:00.893]  And it might take 10 minutes, it might take an hour for it to turn pink and then blue when it's picking nothing up.
[00:30:00.954 --> 00:30:01.974]  And these are so strong.
[00:30:02.334 --> 00:30:05.255]  In my home, if I sneeze 20 feet away,
[00:30:06.696 --> 00:30:09.357]  In a few seconds, it goes from blue to red.
[00:30:09.717 --> 00:30:11.078]  It's picking up that particular.
[00:30:11.618 --> 00:30:20.661]  That's what's so amazing about this unit is the sensors are so strong and the four filtration systems are so compact but so powerful.
[00:30:20.801 --> 00:30:24.183]  Could you spend way more and get something that maybe has a little bit better specs?
[00:30:24.243 --> 00:30:24.443]  Yes.
[00:30:25.083 --> 00:30:30.346]  But there are a lot of filters out there that are $500, $600, $700 that aren't even as good.
[00:30:30.626 --> 00:30:34.509]  And again, these can go six months to a year depending on how dirty the environment is.
[00:30:34.969 --> 00:30:37.350]  The replacement filters are very, very inexpensive.
[00:30:37.871 --> 00:30:41.813]  Do yourself a favor and go to InfowarsStore.com today.
[00:30:42.253 --> 00:30:43.434]  Read the specs for yourself.
[00:30:44.014 --> 00:30:45.575]  And then you have nothing to lose.
[00:30:45.996 --> 00:30:46.696]  Spend $200.
[00:30:47.557 --> 00:30:50.219]  Help us make $50 to fund our operation.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.761]  Get an amazing unit in your home.
[00:30:53.042 --> 00:31:00.648]  I'm very confident that we're gonna see you come back and order several more, and then a few more for your office, and then to give them as gifts as well.
[00:31:00.928 --> 00:31:04.091]  There are studies, and listen to me carefully, all over the world,
[00:31:05.091 --> 00:31:18.338]  And depending on the study, it's between 7 and 12 years that the average person loses off their life expectancy living in a big city alone because of the toxins and the particulates.
[00:31:18.658 --> 00:31:21.040]  You then add all the pollen and the rest of it.
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:30.244]  It is not a luxury to have the Alexa Pure Breeze that is the best filtration system out there at the lowest price.
[00:31:31.345 --> 00:31:32.846]  It is essential.
[00:31:34.304 --> 00:31:40.486]  We are doing everything we can to mitigate the toxic environment that industrial society has created.
[00:31:40.726 --> 00:31:41.947]  So support the InfoWarp.
[00:31:42.387 --> 00:31:45.168]  Fund folks that are fighting the globalists and having success.

[00:31:53.271 --> 00:31:58.592]  We also have their full line of amazing gravity-fed filters as well, which are a huge home run.
[00:31:58.893 --> 00:32:02.294]  But this, this is a grand slam.
[00:32:03.254 --> 00:32:09.239]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.

[00:33:05.535 --> 00:33:08.157]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:14.489 --> 00:33:19.572]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[00:33:20.512 --> 00:33:22.113]  Government is the problem.
[00:33:25.034 --> 00:33:31.818]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[00:33:32.738 --> 00:33:39.862]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[00:33:40.768 --> 00:33:42.489]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:42.929 --> 00:33:44.430]  Because there is a war on.
[00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:45.890]  For your mind.
[00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:48.071]  Hello me.
[00:33:48.451 --> 00:33:49.432]  Meet the real me.
[00:33:49.452 --> 00:33:52.313]  In my misfits way of life.
[00:33:52.493 --> 00:33:59.616]  Now coming up... For the first half of the next hour, Roger Stone is going to be joining us.
[00:34:00.756 --> 00:34:09.680]  He's out taping a bunch of big morning interviews for the major TV networks because they can't ignore the fact that he broke
[00:34:10.708 --> 00:34:18.898]  The information here Friday that the president said he was looking to release the files unless he got any countervailing information.
[00:34:19.519 --> 00:34:30.151]  And I remember saying to Roger on the phone Thursday night and Friday morning, I said, Roger, if Trump says he's going to release it, barring new information, let's just say that.
[00:34:31.161 --> 00:34:33.242]  He said, no, because I don't want to influence it.
[00:34:33.922 --> 00:34:35.263]  He goes, I think he's going to do the right thing.
[00:34:35.783 --> 00:34:36.803]  And you heard him say that on air.
[00:34:36.843 --> 00:34:39.484]  He said, no, they're saying he isn't going to release it in the news.
[00:34:39.524 --> 00:34:40.144]  That's not true.
[00:34:40.765 --> 00:34:42.485]  He's leaning towards it, and I think he will.
[00:34:43.185 --> 00:34:46.927]  And then Saturday morning, the president came out and said just that.
[00:34:47.047 --> 00:34:48.747]  And what's in these files?
[00:34:49.388 --> 00:34:50.608]  I don't just have a good idea.
[00:34:51.608 --> 00:34:55.450]  A lot of what was in the Warren Commission and in the Congressional Commission that came after that
[00:34:56.645 --> 00:34:58.005]  The Commission's found two different things.
[00:34:58.325 --> 00:35:04.687]  The Warren Commission, as funny as a $3 bill, with a bunch of people that were involved actually in the operation, clear conflict of interest.
[00:35:05.747 --> 00:35:08.628]  The Warren Commission, it found single gunmen.
[00:35:09.468 --> 00:35:18.911]  The Congressional Commission, you never hear about in the media, much bigger, much more lengthy, and part of it classified, said, oh yeah, multiple shooters, deep state operation.
[00:35:21.571 --> 00:35:24.612]  You can pull up the Congressional JFK Assassination Commission.
[00:35:25.996 --> 00:35:27.657]  And read its findings for yourself.
[00:35:27.717 --> 00:35:30.339]  So, I know what's in those files.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.540]  A lot of it ended up leaking.
[00:35:33.101 --> 00:35:35.502]  I've had some of the congressmen and folks before they died on.
[00:35:36.163 --> 00:35:41.106]  And I had Admiral Moore on, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, two weeks before he died.
[00:35:41.186 --> 00:35:44.648]  I didn't realize it was like a deathbed confession.
[00:35:45.689 --> 00:35:47.270]  That he was having congestive heart failure.
[00:35:48.491 --> 00:35:51.833]  And I called Newsmax up like a month later and said, can I get Admiral Moore back on?
[00:35:52.894 --> 00:35:54.255]  They said, the Admiral just died.
[00:35:55.233 --> 00:35:56.834]  But that was on other issues.
[00:35:58.274 --> 00:36:04.457]  About the new world order and the globalists and the plan to sell out the country and hand over the Panama Canal and all our secrets to communist China.
[00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:09.419]  Again, people keep thinking the government's the problem.
[00:36:09.719 --> 00:36:11.660]  I want constitutional limited government.
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:12.960]  I'm not an anarchist.
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:14.381]  I want a republic back.
[00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:17.402]  And the government's not our enemy.
[00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:20.743]  It's the bad people that have hijacked the government that are our enemy.
[00:36:21.424 --> 00:36:23.925]  And the media always misrepresents what I'm saying
[00:36:25.327 --> 00:36:34.769]  To say Jones believes in no government, or Jones hates everybody in government, or Jones is anti-government, or Jones is gloom and doom and believes the world's gonna end.
[00:36:35.609 --> 00:36:36.789]  And he believes in space aliens.
[00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:38.850]  It's always the same stuff.
[00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:40.890]  I believe we can save the world.
[00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.331]  God helps those that help themselves.
[00:36:43.271 --> 00:36:45.511]  Trust in God, pray to God, but row away from the rocks.
[00:36:46.051 --> 00:36:48.832]  Hunter S. Thompson quote, that's basically
[00:36:50.669 --> 00:36:54.773]  A paraphrase of a Bedouin saying, trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[00:36:55.533 --> 00:36:58.916]  You know, trust in God, but God helps those that help themselves.
[00:36:58.956 --> 00:37:01.098]  God gave us common sense, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:01.538 --> 00:37:02.159]  God made us.
[00:37:02.619 --> 00:37:03.960]  That's God helping you right there.
[00:37:04.381 --> 00:37:11.447]  Now, you do the right thing and have courage, God will almost always take you the rest of the way unless it's part of God's plan you be an example.
[00:37:11.947 --> 00:37:15.891]  As long as, in my experience, you just give in to whatever God's plan is and not worry about it.
[00:37:16.391 --> 00:37:17.432]  God's gonna get you then.
[00:37:18.072 --> 00:37:24.778]  People that are like at odds with God and believe in God but think God's like their slave and think God's there to be bossed around.
[00:37:25.518 --> 00:37:26.879]  That's not the way to get through to God.
[00:37:26.919 --> 00:37:27.900]  I'm just telling you right now.
[00:37:29.661 --> 00:37:31.122]  And God isn't looking for hypocrites either.
[00:37:31.723 --> 00:37:34.525]  And people that pray up on top of the hilltop and tell everybody how great they are.
[00:37:35.005 --> 00:37:35.946]  God's looking for action.
[00:37:36.707 --> 00:37:37.487]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:37:40.851 --> 00:37:47.512]  Trump is doing so much good that I just felt like I should come on air and thank God for you, the listeners.
[00:37:49.542 --> 00:37:55.946]  And thank God for Trump, and thank God for everything, and this great crew we've got, and all the providence, we wouldn't be here without you.
[00:37:56.006 --> 00:37:57.187]  And I mean that so heartfelt.
[00:37:58.948 --> 00:38:00.188]  This isn't me stroking you.
[00:38:00.709 --> 00:38:08.894]  I feel like I'm not doing my job unless I tell you how special you are and how amazing you are, no matter what color your skin is or where you came from.
[00:38:09.174 --> 00:38:11.035]  If you want liberty, you understand justice.
[00:38:11.395 --> 00:38:15.658]  You see these things, you feel these things, you know these things, because you've got discernment.
[00:38:15.898 --> 00:38:17.019]  You've got a connection to God.
[00:38:17.879 --> 00:38:20.600]  You're a person that has a connection to justice.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.761]  You're not of the evil force.
[00:38:24.421 --> 00:38:26.622]  And that evil force wants to destroy you and me.
[00:38:27.782 --> 00:38:31.384]  And you will know a man or a woman by their enemies and by their fruits.
[00:38:32.424 --> 00:38:35.945]  And you look at the whole world, as Christ said, if you're for me, the world will be against you.
[00:38:36.145 --> 00:38:37.206]  The whole world!
[00:38:37.506 --> 00:38:41.027]  Hollywood, The Globalist, all the structures are against Trump.
[00:38:42.768 --> 00:38:46.629]  Because he's not out to get you and he wants justice and prosperity.
[00:38:50.765 --> 00:38:51.526]  And they don't know what to do.
[00:38:53.867 --> 00:39:14.943]  And they're getting more and more panicked and more and more angry as the economy comes back and as Trump begins to have success and as they begin to get on the run from Spain to Brazil to Australia to the UK to Iceland to all over the world, the United States to
[00:39:16.516 --> 00:39:22.201]  What just happened two weeks ago in Austria, electing a Donald Trump type populist.
[00:39:22.701 --> 00:39:27.105]  And a Czech election just elected Bebis in a huge large margin.
[00:39:27.705 --> 00:39:30.027]  And the guy literally sounds like Infowars.
[00:39:30.328 --> 00:39:32.369]  And I know folks that have been over to the Czech Republic and met with him.
[00:39:32.389 --> 00:39:34.251]  I remember hearing like six months ago, you know who Bebis is?
[00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:34.891]  You know who Bebis is?
[00:39:35.092 --> 00:39:36.713]  You ought to go to, you know, you ought to go to the Republic.
[00:39:36.733 --> 00:39:37.153]  He likes you.
[00:39:37.333 --> 00:39:39.815]  I'm not bragging, oh Bebis knows who I am and likes me.
[00:39:40.036 --> 00:39:41.437]  The point is, it's like a Ron Paul.
[00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:42.658]  Boom!
[00:39:44.042 --> 00:39:45.666]  He just won huge in the Czech Republic.
[00:39:46.488 --> 00:39:48.172]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:39:48.934 --> 00:39:51.481]  And now people in Africa are saying, we want free market.
[00:39:51.801 --> 00:39:52.824]  We don't want communism.
[00:39:53.646 --> 00:40:02.550]  There's all these videos in different African languages translated into English where people on TV, local television stations going, no, no, we don't want the big banks and their communism.
[00:40:02.771 --> 00:40:03.371]  They now get it.
[00:40:03.511 --> 00:40:07.953]  Big, rich people want communism to control you because they're offshore and exempt.
[00:40:08.273 --> 00:40:11.735]  And once people get that, no to Obama.
[00:40:12.235 --> 00:40:12.996]  We want cars.
[00:40:13.036 --> 00:40:13.956]  We want air conditioning.
[00:40:15.537 --> 00:40:17.578]  Plus, you let folks have cars and air conditioning.
[00:40:18.258 --> 00:40:19.859]  You clean up the technology, which has happened.
[00:40:20.219 --> 00:40:21.680]  People have two kids on average.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.301]  They don't have 14 children.
[00:40:25.128 --> 00:40:27.811]  And we all sail off at the sunset together instead of destroying the planet.
[00:40:28.772 --> 00:40:39.225]  It's so amazing to be alive right now, ladies and gentlemen, and I look at the tax cut plan Trump's got and the left attacking it, saying,
[00:40:40.936 --> 00:40:47.659]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a 40% corporate tax rate, but he wants to give rich corporations all that money.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:41:01.887]  The rich corporations 30 years ago, on record, lobbied to have the highest corporate tax in the world to make everyone go offshore because the big Fortune 100 controlled China and India and could control who could get into those markets.
[00:41:02.167 --> 00:41:06.189]  So they wanted to make it cost prohibitive to operate here to knock out their competition.
[00:41:07.049 --> 00:41:09.712]  China has a 15% corporate tax.
[00:41:10.012 --> 00:41:10.493]  We've got a 40.
[00:41:11.254 --> 00:41:12.755]  Do you think we can compete?
[00:41:12.856 --> 00:41:18.402]  The communists have a 15% tax and we got a 40.
[00:41:19.863 --> 00:41:22.386]  Because they're not communists, they're fascist controlling slaves.
[00:41:22.726 --> 00:41:23.747]  No such thing as communism.
[00:41:23.788 --> 00:41:26.010]  It was created by the robber barons to screw everybody.
[00:41:26.591 --> 00:41:27.592]  And they brag about that.
[00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:38.258]  So we get that, and we get 4 tax brackets or 3 tax brackets instead of 10, and they lower the highest tax rate for people that actually pay tax from 45.
[00:41:38.399 --> 00:41:39.340]  It's really at 45.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.563]  They say it's at 40, but it's really at 45, because they got rid of the exemptions.
[00:41:42.803 --> 00:41:44.145]  They lower it from 45 to 30?
[00:41:44.245 --> 00:41:47.548]  The economy's going to explode!
[00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:51.552]  And if you want to work, you're going to be able to get a job and save and get ahead.
[00:41:52.625 --> 00:41:53.386]  That's what works.
[00:41:53.987 --> 00:41:55.689]  And if people want it, it's waiting.
[00:41:56.050 --> 00:42:02.698]  I'm going to go to break here and come back with the big Vegas news and Jimmy Carter coming out in support of Trump.
[00:42:02.719 --> 00:42:04.301]  The worm's turning, folks.
[00:42:04.781 --> 00:42:05.863]  Trump's got him on the run.
[00:42:05.983 --> 00:42:06.804]  You got him on the run.
[00:42:07.585 --> 00:42:14.390]  There's not just evil in the universe, and it doesn't mean we're offering some utopia, but we're fighting for our lives here against really evil people.
[00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:15.591]  That's why this is happening.
[00:42:15.771 --> 00:42:19.254]  The globalists got so evil, and we're going to go for broke and kill the golden goose.
[00:42:19.634 --> 00:42:20.455]  That's why this is happening.
[00:42:20.655 --> 00:42:23.577]  Just briefly, we've got our great supplements at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:42:23.837 --> 00:42:25.198]  That's one way we fund our operation.

[00:42:35.346 --> 00:42:36.306]  Super Metal Vitality is 30% off.
[00:42:37.948 --> 00:42:39.569]  Caveman, that special 50% off.

[00:42:41.291 --> 00:42:43.173]  They haven't taken it down yet because they haven't done new specials.
[00:42:43.453 --> 00:42:48.137]  But what is going to end the next few days is Brain Force Plus, our great new tropic.
[00:42:48.157 --> 00:42:48.358]  50% off.

[00:47:05.894 --> 00:47:08.516]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:28.072]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto Line.
[00:47:28.232 --> 00:47:32.334]  The desert is my brother, my skin is cracked and dry.
[00:47:32.914 --> 00:47:40.618]  I was riding on a folk coach and everything was fine, till we took a shorter road to save some time.
[00:47:42.964 --> 00:47:44.386]  It's the Infowar, my friends.
[00:47:59.908 --> 00:48:15.121]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, let's jump right into it as we prepare to close out this hour and give you the inside intel on the JFK documents that are about to come out.
[00:48:15.702 --> 00:48:17.904]  This info isn't directly from the President's mouth.
[00:48:18.524 --> 00:48:21.085]  Like Friday's news was, this is from our own deep research.
[00:48:21.485 --> 00:48:26.668]  Roger Stone's a best-selling author and researcher, New York Times best-selling author on JFK.
[00:48:27.068 --> 00:48:32.070]  And I, of course, have interviewed all the main experts and been deeply involved in researching it.
[00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:34.231]  And a little bit more than that.
[00:48:34.251 --> 00:48:36.012]  A little secret sauce in there.
[00:48:36.492 --> 00:48:40.774]  I'll leave it at that, but I did get the deathbed confession of E. Howard Hunt with his son.
[00:48:42.025 --> 00:48:43.906]  Who now admittedly did run the operation.
[00:48:44.606 --> 00:48:48.008]  And I of course had a lot of family in Dallas and Austin.
[00:48:48.348 --> 00:48:51.330]  Back when they weren't as big of towns as they are now.
[00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:55.672]  I knew what happened to JFK from the time I could understand English.
[00:48:56.613 --> 00:49:01.698]  Boy, what I was told when I was a child turned out to be spot-on true, and I'll leave it at that.
[00:49:02.479 --> 00:49:19.215]  Now, let's go ahead and plow directly into the news and information on a more modern cover-up than just JFK that now 91% of Americans last year at the last anniversary, the 52nd anniversary or 53rd anniversary, was it 53 or 54 years since 1963,
[00:49:24.517 --> 00:49:30.400]  We have the cover up of Vegas going back on October 1st, now 22 days ago.
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:31.960]  It was a Sunday broadcast.
[00:49:32.641 --> 00:49:37.223]  I said Antifa and BLM and any means necessary say they're getting ready to get violent.
[00:49:38.223 --> 00:49:41.625]  They're getting ready to attack starting October 1st, not November 4th.
[00:49:43.066 --> 00:49:51.074]  November 4th, the Democrats and others officially say they're going to get violent the streets of America in all 50 capitals and other major cities.
[00:49:51.574 --> 00:49:56.379]  We're going to have our limited crew in places like New York, Los Angeles, and right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:50:01.083]  And I even have some great military guys that are still active duty that are going to be
[00:50:03.444 --> 00:50:09.229]  Well, let's just say those kind of guys are never on duty or off duty that are volunteering to go cover some of this for us as well.
[00:50:09.249 --> 00:50:13.292]  So we're gonna have a lot of eyes and ears on this as they attempt to launch a second
[00:50:15.202 --> 00:50:20.187]  Communist revolution on the 100-year anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
[00:50:20.207 --> 00:50:21.428]  And they admit that's their plan.
[00:50:21.768 --> 00:50:23.370]  We'll see if it's a dud and fizzles.
[00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:27.794]  Looks like it may be because there's such a huge awakening, but we shouldn't be too confident.
[00:50:28.194 --> 00:50:30.356]  So here's the new big Vegas bombshell.
[00:50:30.857 --> 00:50:34.260]  It's up on Infowars.com from IntelHub.com.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.863]  I want to get Shepard Ambulas, investigative journalist, on.
[00:50:37.203 --> 00:50:38.564]  He is an amazing researcher.
[00:50:39.585 --> 00:50:40.846]  Really should just hire Shepard.
[00:50:41.267 --> 00:50:42.568]  He's been wanting to get on board for years.
[00:50:42.608 --> 00:50:43.489]  He just hasn't had the budget.
[00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:48.834]  But we gotta find a way to get this guy on board because he just keeps being at the center of so many big stories.
[00:50:50.076 --> 00:50:55.301]  Vegas Bombshell video shows 17 ambulances pulling bodies out of Hooters.
[00:50:56.402 --> 00:50:57.984]  And we've blown up the video.
[00:50:59.085 --> 00:51:02.809]  It's shot in HD and bigger than Dallas, bigger than Vegas.
[00:51:03.709 --> 00:51:07.753]  They are pulling dozens and dozens of bodies out.
[00:51:07.853 --> 00:51:14.399]  And there's a time lapse video, there's an unedited video that's like 45 minutes long up on Infowars.com.
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.381]  There's a condensed video.
[00:51:17.222 --> 00:51:27.445]  That was put together by High Impact Flicks, who does a great job, of the YouTuber Benjamin Franks, who we're going to get on as a witness this week if we can, who put up the whole video.
[00:51:27.725 --> 00:51:36.548]  He just shot this out of his hotel window, out of the MGM, about 200 yards away, and they're not triaging and directing bodies over.
[00:51:36.568 --> 00:51:41.610]  You've got big exits hundreds of yards away from the venue, and you see police taking bodies out of there.
[00:51:42.515 --> 00:51:44.416]  It looks like the Hooters have shot up.
[00:51:44.877 --> 00:51:56.125]  And you've got not just Mandalay, but you've got other places on the Vegas Strip that are upwards of a mile away reporting shots fired and broken glass and bullets on the ground.
[00:51:56.145 --> 00:51:57.466]  And we've already covered all that.
[00:51:58.006 --> 00:51:59.828]  We've already shot in-depth reports on it.
[00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:06.413]  We had federal law enforcement tell us the morning after that Alex
[00:52:07.515 --> 00:52:10.477]  It's Antifa slash ISIS paraphernalia.
[00:52:10.738 --> 00:52:12.539]  He was traveling the Middle East with his girlfriend.
[00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:14.581]  All this is going on.
[00:52:14.601 --> 00:52:15.321]  There's a cover-up.
[00:52:15.541 --> 00:52:16.502]  There's more than one shooter.
[00:52:17.022 --> 00:52:18.644]  And then notice all that came out.
[00:52:18.684 --> 00:52:23.147]  They changed the timeline and it turned out he shot earlier down the hall like we said.
[00:52:23.367 --> 00:52:25.269]  There were witnesses saying you better get out of here.
[00:52:25.289 --> 00:52:26.250]  You're gonna die in 45 minutes.
[00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:29.612]  We don't know exactly what happened and neither do our law enforcement sources.
[00:52:29.992 --> 00:52:30.953]  It's so compartmentalized.
[00:52:30.993 --> 00:52:34.536]  But there were other shooters who were shot.
[00:52:36.257 --> 00:52:36.858]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:37.802 --> 00:52:39.523]  And again, we've already broken all that down.
[00:52:40.183 --> 00:52:43.964]  And there were reports of people being shooting from the directions of Hooters.
[00:52:44.324 --> 00:52:46.965]  There may have been somebody in there shooting people who got killed by cops.
[00:52:47.325 --> 00:52:53.047]  We know police at multiple locations, people saw them shoot masked men and broken glass and shell cases.
[00:52:53.807 --> 00:52:56.308]  And we've already had the witnesses on, we've reported it.
[00:52:56.328 --> 00:52:57.448]  I mean, the videos are legion.
[00:52:59.318 --> 00:53:07.489]  So all I know is we're being lied to and we know the FBI got hundreds of cell phones, in fact tried to confiscate them from everybody that exited.
[00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:11.775]  Hundreds and hundreds of cell phones and are asking other people not to upload it.
[00:53:12.036 --> 00:53:15.681]  We've had witnesses that were going to organize groups to go public dropping dead.
[00:53:17.557 --> 00:53:20.918]  So I'm not saying the FBI itself's bad, but the guy running the Vegas operation?
[00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:30.882]  I've had high-level SEAL Team 6, high-level federal marshals, high-level FBI say that guy is a Clinton-slash-Obama operative, and now it's come out.
[00:53:31.922 --> 00:53:37.664]  So, he should be right under Phil Mudd at the FBI, who says they're gonna kill the President, so.
[00:53:38.804 --> 00:53:40.545]  Some dangerous hombres, I'll tell you right now.
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:47.045]  And I've been told that the guy running Vegas is Mr. Scourge or whatever.
[00:53:47.725 --> 00:53:49.547]  Scourge is, what's his name?
[00:53:49.567 --> 00:53:50.468]  I'm teleprompter free.
[00:53:51.449 --> 00:53:51.789]  Roos.
[00:53:51.889 --> 00:53:52.950]  Roos is Roos, yes.
[00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:55.472]  That he is just the worst there is.
[00:53:55.492 --> 00:53:56.553]  I don't have any knowledge of that.
[00:53:56.853 --> 00:53:58.475]  I've just been told that and I see his pedigree.
[00:53:58.995 --> 00:54:01.918]  His pedigree is like directly from the loins of Lucifer.
[00:54:02.919 --> 00:54:03.399]  Politically.
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.082]  From the Clintons and Obama and Mueller.
[00:54:06.582 --> 00:54:12.564]  Who's running scared now, now caught us the back man with uranium on the tarmac to the FSB, former KGB.
[00:54:12.624 --> 00:54:21.146]  I mean, no wonder they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off, saying I'm a Russian and Rand Paul's a Russian and Tucker Carlson, if he didn't believe the fake stuff, you're a Russian!
[00:54:21.206 --> 00:54:21.967]  Remember Tucker Carlson?
[00:54:22.127 --> 00:54:22.647]  You're one!
[00:54:22.687 --> 00:54:23.087]  You're one!
[00:54:23.167 --> 00:54:24.587]  And Tucker's like, you're crazy!
[00:54:25.648 --> 00:54:26.468]  But that's what they do.
[00:54:27.779 --> 00:54:28.660]  So here's the report.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.161]  A boil-down.
[00:54:30.221 --> 00:54:34.784]  Again, if it's radio, you've got to go watch it at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:37.687]  We're streaming it live right now, or it's in the article, Vegas Bombshell.
[00:54:38.147 --> 00:54:39.848]  But let's go ahead and roll this report.
[00:54:39.888 --> 00:54:40.309]  It's powerful.
[00:54:41.013 --> 00:54:44.376]  Every piece of information we get is just one more piece of the puzzle.
[00:54:44.596 --> 00:54:48.940]  And that brings me to a video that was just uploaded to YouTube by Benjamin Branks.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:54.805]  His video is taken from the perspective of the MGM Grand Hotel across the street from Hooters.
[00:54:55.166 --> 00:55:00.590]  Benjamin is facing south with the concert event area in Mandalay Bay to his southwest.
[00:55:00.911 --> 00:55:06.476]  According to the video, at the 27 second mark, Benjamin says they're pulling bodies out of Hooters.
[00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:07.436]  They're just pulling.
[00:55:08.317 --> 00:55:09.878]  So many bodies out of that Hooters.
[00:55:09.958 --> 00:55:11.119]  I don't know if people are dead.
[00:55:11.239 --> 00:55:12.339]  I don't know if they're just injured.
[00:55:12.859 --> 00:55:16.741]  At first, there were six ambulances that could be seen parked in front of Hooters.
[00:55:17.042 --> 00:55:23.505]  By the time you get to the five-minute mark, you can count 16 ambulances parked in a line with more speeding by.
[00:55:23.745 --> 00:55:29.048]  Now, I've compressed some of the time of this video here to give you a partial time lapse of the activity below.
[00:55:29.548 --> 00:55:32.370]  This is the MGM Grand from around their perspective.
[00:55:32.611 --> 00:55:39.116]  Here's Hooters, and way over here is the event area with Mandalay Bay even further to the southwest.
[00:55:39.457 --> 00:55:49.685]  Now, I understand that police had certain areas blocked off, but why in the hell were they parked in front of Hooters this far away, and why were bodies being taken from inside Hooters?
[00:55:50.025 --> 00:55:55.130]  Why do we not see people flooding this parking lot right here, traveling north from the venue,
[00:55:55.470 --> 00:56:01.177]  Or emergency personnel running south of this parking lot to the concert grounds to take care of the injured.
[00:56:01.397 --> 00:56:03.760]  Benjamin Franks deserves credit for filming this.
[00:56:04.161 --> 00:56:06.884]  It may not have been his intention... By the way, hit pause.
[00:56:07.364 --> 00:56:10.528]  When I said a couple hundred yards, I meant just across the street from one point.
[00:56:10.949 --> 00:56:11.730]  Hooters is...
[00:56:13.872 --> 00:56:18.438]  0.8 miles or 1.1 kilometers away from Mandalay.
[00:56:18.458 --> 00:56:22.202]  I mean, folks, you've got ambulances going and you can blow it up.
[00:56:22.222 --> 00:56:23.964]  There's bodies being brought out on stretchers.
[00:56:25.286 --> 00:56:27.108]  What looks like 15 or more ambulances.
[00:56:27.128 --> 00:56:27.789]  Let's just continue.
[00:56:29.562 --> 00:56:34.123]  And again, the original report from High Impact Flix is longer, and of course there's Benjamin Frank's original footage.
[00:56:34.143 --> 00:56:38.684]  Everybody go see this for yourself, and hats off to both High Impact Flix and Benjamin Franks, because that's real journalism.
[00:56:59.707 --> 00:57:03.229]  There are thousands of these videos now starting to get uploaded.
[00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:05.310]  We are just inundated.
[00:57:05.951 --> 00:57:10.874]  The crew is, I'm not complaining, but we're doing 10 hours a day of live radio and TV now.
[00:57:11.334 --> 00:57:13.495]  And then we got the major news sites and the research.
[00:57:14.095 --> 00:57:20.019]  And so I've got just two or three people that are sitting there trying to watch all this and it's just unbelievable.
[00:57:22.314 --> 00:57:33.902]  I mean, it is totally clear this was an ISIS terror attack, working with a leftist antifa, connected into Kurdish groups and communist groups in the Middle East, as best we can tell.
[00:57:34.602 --> 00:57:40.767]  And they told the president, sir, it's a trigger to launch a major Islamic attack on the U.S.
[00:57:40.807 --> 00:57:42.047]  So please don't say it's Islamic.
[00:57:42.087 --> 00:57:42.668]  That's the trigger.
[00:57:42.908 --> 00:57:46.210]  So that's why Trump has allowed them to basically cover this up.
[00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:48.432]  And I think that's a miscalculation and a mistake.
[00:57:48.672 --> 00:57:49.312]  But there you go.
[00:57:49.332 --> 00:57:51.854]  It just validates everything Trump's actually been talking about.
[00:57:51.954 --> 00:57:52.042]  Yeah.
[00:57:53.467 --> 00:57:58.350]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[00:57:59.151 --> 00:58:02.093]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[00:58:02.753 --> 00:58:05.555]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[00:58:06.176 --> 00:58:11.059]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.

[00:59:54.866 --> 01:00:00.769]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:10.086 --> 01:00:18.410]  Coming up, ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone after breaking the exclusive news that the president was going to declassify the JFK files next week.
[01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:24.072]  But we're going to give you the rest of the story and a lot more coming up after this next break.
[01:00:24.392 --> 01:00:26.193]  Then Jimmy Carter's come out in support.
[01:00:26.653 --> 01:00:26.973]  I don't think so.
[01:00:44.028 --> 01:00:46.629]  They make a great team for globalism, don't they?
[01:00:46.889 --> 01:00:52.551]  Is it all hands on deck for the minions of the elites, puppets, George W. Bush and Barack Obama?
[01:00:52.771 --> 01:00:56.833]  Has populism and awareness become too large a threat to ignore?
[01:00:57.133 --> 01:01:08.297]  Obama, desperate to sway voters, attempted to sell pseudo-populism to the Democrats after bludgeoning the country for eight years with orders from Bilderberg and the United Nations.
[01:01:08.558 --> 01:01:09.518]  And so the question now,
[01:01:11.455 --> 01:01:23.710]  At a time when our politics just seems so divided and so angry and so nasty, when everybody pushes in the same direction, that's when good things happen.
[01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:29.677]  And we live in a time when all sorts of forces conspire to turn good people off from politics.
[01:01:31.343 --> 01:01:45.289]  The way we get our news, the way money floods into our campaigns, the way our political districts are drawn so that candidates are rewarded for pandering to the extremes instead of trying to keep common ground.
[01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:57.234]  Instead of looking for ways to work together and get things done in a practical way, we've got folks who are deliberately trying to make folks angry.
[01:01:59.246 --> 01:02:01.267]  You know, I'm trained by resistance and I'm going to break you.
[01:02:01.307 --> 01:02:02.788]  We have different ideas.
[01:02:03.348 --> 01:02:05.610]  To get the base all riled up.
[01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:10.872]  Because it provides a short-term tactical advantage.
[01:02:10.912 --> 01:02:15.835]  But if we're going to talk about our history, then we should do it in a way that heals.
[01:02:17.356 --> 01:02:18.417]  Not in a way that wounds.
[01:02:19.537 --> 01:02:20.798]  Not in a way that divides.
[01:02:22.059 --> 01:02:26.181]  We shouldn't use the most painful parts of our history just to score political points.
[01:02:28.615 --> 01:02:31.657]  We saw what happened in Charlottesville.
[01:02:32.078 --> 01:02:41.044]  While George W. Bush blamed the will of the American people, labeling the newfound surge of economic prosperity and nationalism racist.
[01:02:41.544 --> 01:02:47.088]  There's an aggressive challenge by Russia and China to the norms and rules of global order.
[01:02:48.249 --> 01:02:55.795]  They propose revisions that always seem to involve less respect for the rights of free nations and less freedom for the individual.
[01:02:57.571 --> 01:03:00.373]  These matters would be difficult under any circumstances.
[01:03:01.514 --> 01:03:08.140]  They are further complicated by a trend in Western countries away from global engagement and democratic confidence.
[01:03:09.601 --> 01:03:12.203]  Parts of Europe have developed an identity crisis.
[01:03:13.484 --> 01:03:25.494]  We have seen insolvency, economic stagnation, youth unemployment, anger about immigration, resurgent ethno-nationalism, and deep questions about the meaning and durability of the European Union.
[01:03:27.233 --> 01:03:28.934]  America is not immune from these trends.
[01:03:30.375 --> 01:03:34.316]  In recent decades, public confidence in our institutions has declined.
[01:03:35.377 --> 01:03:41.700]  Our governing class has often been paralyzed in the face of obvious and pressing needs.
[01:03:43.061 --> 01:03:49.124]  The American dream of upward mobility seems out of reach for some who feel left behind in a changing economy.
[01:03:49.704 --> 01:03:53.906]  Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts.
[01:03:55.356 --> 01:03:56.697]  Bigotry seems emboldened.
[01:03:57.758 --> 01:04:03.483]  Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.
[01:04:04.323 --> 01:04:06.745]  Crawl back into your New World Order holes.
[01:04:07.046 --> 01:04:09.007]  America knows who you really are.
[01:04:09.267 --> 01:04:11.750]  Whatever you're selling, we're not buying.
[01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:13.711]  President Bush, to me, embarrassed himself.
[01:04:14.372 --> 01:04:16.293]  Speechwriter wrote a highfalutin speech.
[01:04:16.794 --> 01:04:19.236]  It's clear he didn't understand anything he was talking about.
[01:04:20.531 --> 01:04:24.383]  He equates the Industrial Revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, globalization.
[01:04:24.644 --> 01:04:26.630]  He has no earthy idea what he's coming or going.
[01:04:27.873 --> 01:04:30.374]  Just like it was when he was President of the United States.
[01:04:30.394 --> 01:04:34.235]  There has not been a more destructive presidency than George Bush's.
[01:04:35.276 --> 01:04:38.937]  The rise of China started with the Clintons and Bush.
[01:04:39.737 --> 01:04:48.941]  When they had this great theory that you let them into the World Trade Organization and give them most favorite nations, that they're going to become a liberal democracy as they get bigger.
[01:04:49.521 --> 01:04:49.841]  Okay?
[01:04:49.881 --> 01:04:52.022]  And they're going to become more free market capitalists.
[01:04:53.062 --> 01:04:54.764]  This is not a small mistake.
[01:04:55.505 --> 01:04:59.388]  This is a strategic mistake of uncountable problems.
[01:04:59.949 --> 01:05:02.071]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:08.023]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:05:08.383 --> 01:05:15.530]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:24.518]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:05:24.738 --> 01:05:28.842]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:05:29.142 --> 01:05:31.364]  Pathenogens added to the food and water,
[01:05:31.644 --> 01:05:38.588]  To the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:05:38.989 --> 01:05:42.251]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:05:42.411 --> 01:05:53.458]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:05:53.558 --> 01:05:56.219]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[01:05:56.439 --> 01:05:59.401]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[01:05:59.521 --> 01:06:02.522]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[01:06:11.566 --> 01:06:13.167]  You've got a business.
[01:06:13.307 --> 01:06:14.108]  You didn't build that.
[01:06:15.108 --> 01:06:16.669]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:06:24.278 --> 01:06:28.440]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:34.623]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:35.544 --> 01:06:49.690]  So, we have hundreds of major newspapers, every major local TV station, the big four networks, constantly saying InfoWars, InfoWars.com is fakeness.
[01:06:50.791 --> 01:06:52.612]  And they say that because they're the fakeness.
[01:06:53.726 --> 01:07:06.374]  And every day, and every week, and every month, and every year, we prove over and over again that you learn what's going to happen here days, weeks, months, years, or decades before.
[01:07:08.315 --> 01:07:20.922]  But most of the time it's because I've read the congressional hearing on the JFK assassination that was bigger and more in-depth than the Warren Commission, and it said multiple shooters, probably the CIA.
[01:07:22.523 --> 01:07:26.066]  So I sound really smart 53 years later when it's all coming out.
[01:07:26.806 --> 01:07:38.074]  Or Roger Stone has been friends for 43, 44 years with President Trump, the former head of his two campaigns, talks to him and the president sounded like he was going to release it, barring new info.
[01:07:38.314 --> 01:07:39.415]  That's what Roger said Friday.
[01:07:39.635 --> 01:07:46.460]  The media ran all these headlines saying, oh look, Roger Stone and Alex Jones say this, but our sources say it's not going to be released.
[01:07:47.782 --> 01:07:48.563]  Yeah, Pompeo.
[01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:50.865]  I'm not against Pompeo, but that's just pressuring him.
[01:07:51.266 --> 01:07:54.329]  Trump tweets on Saturday morning, no, barring new info, I'm going to release it.
[01:07:54.970 --> 01:08:01.617]  So they just can't stand the fact that we don't just have the sources that are honorable, but we're pro-America and we're winning.
[01:08:01.637 --> 01:08:06.542]  We just saw the new Czech billionaire model after Trump a populist win by a huge margin.
[01:08:06.823 --> 01:08:08.364]  We just saw a patriot model after Trump.
[01:08:08.965 --> 01:08:20.993]  When in Austria, we see it in Australia, we see Catalonia trying to break away in a Trump-type movement, we see Reykjavik, Iceland, we see Brazil moving in that direction, we see Brexit, we see it everywhere!
[01:08:21.113 --> 01:08:24.816]  People don't want to be under a big private corporate New World Order!
[01:08:27.198 --> 01:08:31.260]  Then you have Frederica Wilson coming out, lying about the President, getting caught lying.
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:36.104]  She wasn't on the phone call, he didn't say the things she said he said, wearing her big fake cowboy hat.
[01:08:37.099 --> 01:08:38.241]  Like Pocahontas over there.
[01:08:38.261 --> 01:08:40.164]  Elizabeth Warren saying she's an Indian.
[01:08:40.204 --> 01:08:41.405]  They're playing Cowboys and Indians.
[01:08:43.128 --> 01:08:47.154]  She's falling on her face saying General Kelly is a racist because he called her stupid.
[01:08:48.937 --> 01:08:49.818]  I'll call you evil!
[01:08:49.838 --> 01:08:52.021]  You're like a clown, witch!
[01:08:53.157 --> 01:08:57.738]  So all of this is happening, but Antifa is planning the terror attacks on November 4th.
[01:08:58.038 --> 01:08:58.859]  Who knows what's coming?
[01:08:58.919 --> 01:08:59.599]  We're in the fight.
[01:08:59.639 --> 01:09:03.000]  We're starting to win, but it's like we lost the first six rounds.
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:05.701]  Now at round 10, we're winning and winning handily.
[01:09:06.081 --> 01:09:10.322]  There's two rounds left, baby, in heavyweight championship for the whole world's future.
[01:09:10.782 --> 01:09:11.902]  Roger Stone joins us.
[01:09:11.922 --> 01:09:15.003]  It isn't about a victory lap, but man, we're right.
[01:09:15.223 --> 01:09:16.284]  Man, we're on target.
[01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:21.005]  Man, we are just dead on, and they can't stand it, can they, Roger?
[01:09:22.048 --> 01:09:23.809]  No, Alex, they really can't.
[01:09:23.889 --> 01:09:37.237]  First of all, let me say, I'm extraordinarily proud of our president, Donald Trump, because I know that the deep state and the intelligence agencies tried to pressure him not to release these documents.
[01:09:37.358 --> 01:09:41.000]  After 50 years, when you have Gerald Posner
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:56.589]  The New York Times best-selling author and supporter of the Warren Commission, in his book, teamed with Roger Stone, who wrote The Man Who Killed Kennedy, the case against LBJ, and we both call for transparency.
[01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:59.371]  The president absolutely did the right thing.
[01:09:59.911 --> 01:10:03.934]  The danger now, Alex, is not allowing the deep state to redact.
[01:10:04.674 --> 01:10:05.795]  And that was my next question.
[01:10:22.005 --> 01:10:23.667]  The question is, what do you think is going to be released?
[01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:28.233]  Because we know from the Congressional Commission and our deep research what's in the files.
[01:10:28.274 --> 01:10:28.934]  A lot of it's leaked.
[01:10:29.215 --> 01:10:32.239]  So we should A, get to that next, but let's do B first.
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:37.186]  The big fear is, Obama said we're going to release the 9-11 files, but they were all blacked out.
[01:10:38.598 --> 01:10:57.886]  Yeah, look, we know from the very last data release of these materials that we have J Edgar Hoover, the FBI director, telling Lyndon Baines Johnson, the president, that the KGB has conducted their own independent investigation and determined that LBJ was the ringleader in John Kennedy's murder.
[01:10:58.246 --> 01:11:06.675]  We have documentation from the previous dump that French intelligence told Jacqueline Kennedy that they concluded Lyndon Johnson was culpable.
[01:11:07.035 --> 01:11:18.588]  We have Bobby Baker, right-hand man to Lyndon Johnson, saying to one of John Kennedy's top aides, John Kennedy will not live out his term and he will die a violent death.
[01:11:19.429 --> 01:11:21.511]  This is at the 1961 inauguration.
[01:11:21.971 --> 01:11:26.176]  So there's no telling what the next tranche could be.
[01:11:26.717 --> 01:11:30.801]  I expect that we will find additional ties to Lyndon Johnson.
[01:11:31.582 --> 01:11:40.412]  And the CIA and their long-term ties to Oswald, which they've been pretty adept at covering up, may finally come to light.
[01:11:43.959 --> 01:11:45.621]  To be clear, you talked to the president.
[01:11:45.681 --> 01:11:47.904]  He said, look, barring new info, I'm probably going to do it.
[01:11:48.024 --> 01:11:51.448]  You on air said he's leaning towards, I think he'll do the right thing.
[01:11:51.468 --> 01:11:53.651]  He's supposed to come out next Friday.
[01:11:53.671 --> 01:11:56.214]  Do you think Pompeo or others can get to him and stop him?
[01:11:56.635 --> 01:12:01.401]  Or will they go the end run and say, OK, sir, we will, but again, completely black it out?
[01:12:02.794 --> 01:12:09.059]  Look, there's no chance that he's going to reverse himself on this, and the public reaction to it, I think, has been quite positive.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.502]  No, I think that they may seek the backdoor.
[01:12:12.682 --> 01:12:19.728]  In July, there was a more limited dump of material, Alex, and far too much of it was redacted and held back.
[01:12:20.348 --> 01:12:28.995]  I will be the first to go public if this is an attempt by the deep state to counter-man what the President has ordered, hoping that he doesn't notice.
[01:12:29.435 --> 01:12:34.479]  The President's committed to transparency, and there's so many things that we'd like to know.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:40.705]  I'd like to see if there's any further evidence of Ted Cruz's father's involvement with Oswald.
[01:12:40.785 --> 01:12:55.317]  We know that Judith Vary-Baker, who is definitely connected to Oswald in the Warren Commission report, has said publicly that she knew Angel Cruz as part of Lee's crew in New Orleans.
[01:12:56.217 --> 01:13:01.260]  So there's a lot of things here that could be extraordinarily interested regarding this upcoming dump.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:02.640]  Sure, and let's stop right there.
[01:13:02.821 --> 01:13:08.483]  Obviously, since you were the head of the campaign and the media made stuff up about you and the fake Russiagate thing has now collapsed.
[01:13:08.503 --> 01:13:14.166]  We know it was the Clintons doing it, so they tried to blame the people exposing it, like yourself, Julian Assange, and others.
[01:13:14.226 --> 01:13:16.527]  Myself, just totally asinine.
[01:13:16.587 --> 01:13:17.708]  Anderson Cooper, they said.
[01:13:18.388 --> 01:13:22.671]  I mean, Anderson Cooper attacked people saying they must be, you know, agents of Russia.
[01:13:23.251 --> 01:13:26.013]  They blamed Tucker Carlson, said, you know, he may be one.
[01:13:26.434 --> 01:13:29.055]  Clearly, they're the ones involved, is why they're scared.
[01:13:29.095 --> 01:13:33.698]  But now, maybe in hindsight, you can get into some of the other conversations with the president.
[01:13:33.718 --> 01:13:42.044]  Because I remember during the campaign, we talked on air and privately saying, look, it looks like Ted Cruz's dad, you know, was involved, was CIA.
[01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.445]  We know it looks like him.
[01:13:43.745 --> 01:13:44.966]  We know he was there.
[01:13:45.446 --> 01:13:47.688]  We think if we bring this out, Cruz will drop out.
[01:13:48.368 --> 01:13:51.093]  Trump did it after you and others talked to him.
[01:13:51.614 --> 01:13:54.298]  It came out and then his dad dropped out two days later.
[01:13:54.598 --> 01:13:58.224]  I mean you talk about, you talk about running for the hills.
[01:13:58.505 --> 01:14:00.087]  I mean you want to talk about that conversation now?
[01:14:00.147 --> 01:14:00.889]  I think it's newsworthy.
[01:14:01.772 --> 01:14:02.933]  Well, look, I would say this.
[01:14:02.993 --> 01:14:04.775]  Donald Trump is his own man.
[01:14:04.835 --> 01:14:06.856]  No, I know that, but you gave him the intel.
[01:14:06.896 --> 01:14:07.477]  Just say it.
[01:14:07.997 --> 01:14:17.766]  That said, Alex, he loves nothing better than giving the needle to his opponents, the way he did to little Marco Rubio, the way he did to lying Ted Cruz.
[01:14:17.846 --> 01:14:21.869]  So he saw the opportunity to needle Ted Cruz about a
[01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:29.813]  photograph that comes from the Warren Commission report that certainly looks like Angel Raphael.
[01:14:30.554 --> 01:14:34.355]  And his father lived there and his father had the connections and our sources say it was him.
[01:14:35.356 --> 01:14:37.997]  We have a witness who says it was here, Judith Vary Baker.
[01:14:38.137 --> 01:14:43.740]  So the president never misses an opportunity to needle his opponent.
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.821]  And then he dropped out right after it came out.
[01:14:46.684 --> 01:14:48.185]  Yeah, no, it was devastating.
[01:14:48.205 --> 01:14:58.369]  It was meant to drive Ted Cruz crazy, and if you saw the videos that day, he was drooling, he was arguing with... I'm just saying, you never take credit for the stuff that I'm even halfway involved in that I'm very proud of.
[01:15:00.272 --> 01:15:12.719]  You know, look, I think it's all covered in my book, The Making of the President 2016, and the role of Infowars, the role of the alt-right media, it's all there.
[01:15:12.779 --> 01:15:13.659]  I commend it to you.
[01:15:14.179 --> 01:15:19.182]  Well, amazing, and again, alt-right, Hillary's term, that's fine, but I mean, we really are the new right, aren't we?
[01:15:20.305 --> 01:15:20.946]  Well, we are.
[01:15:20.966 --> 01:15:36.721]  The other thing I want to point out, because this is important historically, Alex, you were the one who covered the E. Howard Hunt deathbed confessions in which Hunt said that this was a CIA operation, that he was on the ground... Hold on, let's start over there.
[01:15:36.841 --> 01:15:43.447]  One more segment with Roger Stone, then I get into General Kelly, who we've both been critical of, but now CNN's saying he's shown his true colors.
[01:15:44.068 --> 01:15:50.596]  He thinks abortion's wrong, he loves God, he thinks women are sacrosanct, and he thinks putting down dead troops' families is wrong.
[01:15:51.036 --> 01:15:52.098]  Oh, he doesn't hate America!
[01:15:52.138 --> 01:15:53.639]  We thought you hated America, Kelly!
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:54.741]  What's your problem?
[01:15:54.761 --> 01:15:57.324]  So we'll talk about all that and more straight ahead.
[01:15:57.364 --> 01:16:00.387]  But Trump is hitting his stride, and we are all winning!
[01:16:00.407 --> 01:16:01.529]  You're gonna get sick of winning!
[01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:11.331]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:16:11.411 --> 01:16:19.657]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:16:19.837 --> 01:16:24.520]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:31.105]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:16:31.485 --> 01:16:38.571]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:16:38.671 --> 01:16:45.536]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:16:45.696 --> 01:16:50.039]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:16:50.159 --> 01:16:53.382]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.

[01:16:59.846 --> 01:17:01.567]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:17:01.727 --> 01:17:04.568]  And we're not getting what humans always thought was key.
[01:17:04.788 --> 01:17:05.449]  The bone broth.
[01:17:06.169 --> 01:17:06.950]  The bone broth.
[01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:08.871]  The b-b-bone broth.
[01:17:08.951 --> 01:17:10.051]  The b-b-bone broth.
[01:17:10.372 --> 01:17:11.012]  The bone broth.
[01:17:11.772 --> 01:17:12.413]  The bone broth.
[01:17:13.093 --> 01:17:14.654]  Well, now it's the next level of that.
[01:17:14.794 --> 01:17:15.434]  It's caveman.
[01:17:16.155 --> 01:17:17.516]  Hey, I need a glass of caveman.
[01:17:17.876 --> 01:17:18.316]  Caveman.
[01:17:18.936 --> 01:17:19.217]  Mmm.
[01:17:19.617 --> 01:17:19.777]  Mmm.
[01:17:20.277 --> 01:17:20.938]  Mmm, man.
[01:17:20.998 --> 01:17:21.278]  Mmm.
[01:17:21.638 --> 01:17:22.439]  It's better than Ovaltine.
[01:17:22.459 --> 01:17:22.739]  Mmm.
[01:17:22.779 --> 01:17:23.720]  Better than Ovaltine.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:23.940]  Mmm.
[01:17:24.141 --> 01:17:25.121]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:17:25.161 --> 01:17:25.342]  Mmm.
[01:17:25.782 --> 01:17:26.583]  It's unbelievable.
[01:17:26.623 --> 01:17:27.243]  Mmm.
[01:17:27.283 --> 01:17:28.945]  Caveman is just over the top.
[01:17:29.425 --> 01:17:30.466]  What in the world?
[01:17:30.826 --> 01:17:31.187]  Mmm.
[01:17:31.227 --> 01:17:34.690]  But now with the milk, I was like, whoa, this has milk in it.
[01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:35.110]  Whoa.
[01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:35.230]  Mmm.
[01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:36.171]  It tastes like good.
[01:17:36.471 --> 01:17:37.312]  Man, this tastes so good.
[01:17:37.332 --> 01:17:38.173]  Mmm.
[01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:39.734]  Tastes like the best milkshake ever.
[01:17:40.855 --> 01:17:41.976]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:17:42.036 --> 01:17:42.196]  Mmm.
[01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:43.377]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:17:43.438 --> 01:17:43.578]  Mmm.
[01:17:43.658 --> 01:17:44.779]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:17:44.839 --> 01:17:45.119]  Mmm.
[01:17:45.159 --> 01:17:45.840]  Like good.
[01:17:53.388 --> 01:18:00.015]  I can say without a doubt, at least in my experience, this is a super home run available at InfoWarsLife.com and it supports the broadcast.
[01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:01.757]  Alright, all the big news straight ahead.
[01:18:02.157 --> 01:18:06.381]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.

[01:18:35.979 --> 01:18:37.000]  We're good to go.
[01:19:02.879 --> 01:19:06.301]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:19:06.662 --> 01:19:13.786]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:19:14.387 --> 01:19:22.772]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:19:23.013 --> 01:19:27.115]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:32.719]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:19:33.019 --> 01:19:36.842]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:19:37.242 --> 01:19:40.344]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[01:19:40.664 --> 01:19:51.692]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:08.196]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:08.597 --> 01:20:11.540]  Another world.
[01:20:14.182 --> 01:20:15.244]  Another time.
[01:20:15.324 --> 01:20:16.685]  In the Age of Wonder.
[01:20:27.356 --> 01:20:28.597]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:31.679]  Newswars.com is our news site.
[01:20:31.959 --> 01:20:35.421]  It's excellent, loads really quick, has a lot of original news and content there.
[01:20:35.461 --> 01:20:39.403]  And of course, Infowars.com is the main site, PrisonPlanet.com the backup.
[01:20:40.004 --> 01:20:43.846]  I just cut right in because this is so important with this final segment with Roger and he's got to go.
[01:20:43.866 --> 01:20:49.610]  He's at a TV studio right now in Florida where he was just doing tapes for big national shows tomorrow morning.
[01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:53.242]  They say that those that are living in history don't know it.
[01:20:53.262 --> 01:20:54.723]  They're so busy fighting.
[01:20:55.043 --> 01:20:58.585]  They're so busy creating the new civilization.
[01:20:59.366 --> 01:21:04.489]  And I'm not tooting our horn, but you, the listeners that have supported us, we're just a microcosm of your power.
[01:21:05.230 --> 01:21:07.872]  And this great crew and our sponsors and our local affiliates.
[01:21:08.632 --> 01:21:10.013]  I mean, we're changing the world.
[01:21:10.073 --> 01:21:11.134]  Globalism's in trouble.
[01:21:11.474 --> 01:21:14.496]  I always knew it's an authoritarian secret system.
[01:21:14.916 --> 01:21:16.317]  If we just stand up, it falls.
[01:21:16.898 --> 01:21:17.878]  We're promoting freedom.
[01:21:18.439 --> 01:21:19.479]  Marilyn Monroe and 57 Chevys.
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.922]  They're promoting North Korea and Venezuela communism?
[01:21:24.362 --> 01:21:27.023]  I mean, if we just stand up and say no, they're going to lose.
[01:21:27.243 --> 01:21:28.324]  It was all a con game!
[01:21:29.764 --> 01:21:35.047]  But I gotta tell you, pinching myself here, that we got the E. Howard Hunt deathbed video confession.
[01:21:36.052 --> 01:21:39.715]  George Norie, his great courage, he premiered the audio confession first.
[01:21:39.755 --> 01:21:40.475]  I got it the next day.
[01:21:41.436 --> 01:21:42.857]  All of this.
[01:21:42.917 --> 01:21:45.118]  Roger Stone getting a lot of the witnesses to talk first.
[01:21:45.178 --> 01:21:51.142]  I mean, we're here instrumental in lobbying the president who made the right decision with great courage to release it.
[01:21:51.603 --> 01:21:53.264]  It's happening, people!
[01:21:53.704 --> 01:21:55.406]  And you're seeing it in 2017.
[01:21:56.367 --> 01:21:57.428]  Roger, you've got the floor.
[01:21:57.649 --> 01:22:05.778]  Get into E. Howard Hunt, the history, the real facts, the fact that this is solved, and whether they black it all out or not, this is just round one.
[01:22:05.998 --> 01:22:08.240]  People ask, why wouldn't they shred it all?
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.363]  Because they keep this stuff for blackmail.
[01:22:10.423 --> 01:22:11.264]  Explain that to folks.
[01:22:12.202 --> 01:22:14.225]  Well, you're exactly right, Alex.
[01:22:14.425 --> 01:22:27.423]  Our friend George Norrie and you first exposed the deathbed confessions of E. Howard Hunt, the legendary CIA operative, Bay of Pigs veteran, later arrested as one of the Watergate burglars.
[01:22:28.084 --> 01:22:35.606]  Among the classified material that is now scheduled to be released are E. Howard Hunt's diaries.
[01:22:35.686 --> 01:22:43.709]  These diaries were seized by the agency and Hunt had fought through his lawyers for their return unsuccessfully.
[01:22:44.249 --> 01:22:45.370]  His son, St.
[01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:49.834]  John Hunt, joins me tomorrow night on The War Room at 5 o'clock Eastern.
[01:22:50.254 --> 01:23:13.613]  He tells me these diaries are incendiary because they confirm everything that you first reported, that the CIA was on the ground in Dallas on November 22, 1963, that General Lansdale of the CIA was on the ground in Dealey Plaza, that it was a CIA operation, but that
[01:23:14.013 --> 01:23:20.299]  Vice President Lyndon Baines Johnson was, to use Howard Hunt's words, running the show.
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:33.012]  That's right, and Hunt was a, quote, armchair quarterback, a benchwarmer, basically was his words, in charge, but he was the second phase down the road of it.
[01:23:33.092 --> 01:23:36.736]  Failed, they were ready with bazookas, hand grenades, you name it.
[01:23:36.756 --> 01:23:37.857]  I mean, they were gonna kill Kennedy.
[01:23:38.851 --> 01:23:47.455]  Well, and look, the House Assassinations Committee in 1978 concluded that organized crime had a role in Kennedy's death.
[01:23:47.895 --> 01:23:56.619]  This is a repudiation of the Warren Commission that tells us that Jack Ruby had no known associations with organized crime.
[01:23:57.339 --> 01:23:58.099]  That's a knee-slap.
[01:23:58.119 --> 01:24:04.102]  Well, you know, going back to World War II, they used La Cosa Nostra and all those groups in Sicily and Italy to help with the pre-invasion.
[01:24:05.558 --> 01:24:18.462]  Well, we also know that once the Central Intelligence Agency and their assets were thrown out of Cuba, we had to rely on the still mob-owned casinos in that country for intelligence on what Castro was doing.
[01:24:18.742 --> 01:24:33.287]  We also know the mob and the Central Intelligence Agency in a secret operation organized by Vice President Richard Nixon, green-lighted by Dwight Eisenhower, sought to assassinate Fidel Castro.
[01:24:33.307 --> 01:24:34.628]  That was Operation Mongoose.
[01:24:35.889 --> 01:24:36.870]  Absolutely.
[01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:46.455]  So we are really interested about these documents because the Hunt diaries, I think, will be explosive and newsworthy.
[01:24:46.475 --> 01:24:50.497]  By the way, I'm ready to finance, I'm ready to get on a plane right now and fly out and meet Hunt.
[01:24:50.538 --> 01:24:53.259]  I did it years before to get the exclusive deathbed confession.
[01:24:53.659 --> 01:24:57.341]  And so I'm ready to get Hunt on air as soon as you, because now, now's the season.
[01:24:57.361 --> 01:24:59.743]  I told everybody, listen, everybody knows they killed Kennedy.
[01:25:00.003 --> 01:25:00.783]  They're tired of hearing about it.
[01:25:00.803 --> 01:25:02.704]  But when the documents come out, they care again.
[01:25:02.724 --> 01:25:05.226]  A huge victory lap for justice and history.
[01:25:05.626 --> 01:25:06.409]  Now is the time.
[01:25:07.131 --> 01:25:09.901]  I just hope that, again, these documents get released on Friday.
[01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:13.432]  Well, uh, and that they haven't redacted them to death.
[01:25:13.492 --> 01:25:15.193]  Let's be clear about what we're expecting.
[01:25:15.633 --> 01:25:22.298]  There is the psychoanalysis, the psychological profile done by Oswald, uh, on Oswald by the CIA.
[01:25:22.718 --> 01:25:29.422]  There is the classified testimony of both CIA and FBI officials to the Congress that was not released at that time.
[01:25:29.522 --> 01:25:36.787]  There is the transcript of the interrogation of Yuri Nisenko, who was thought by some to be Oswald's handler.
[01:25:37.167 --> 01:25:39.449]  There are, uh, documents pertaining to Oswald.
[01:25:39.469 --> 01:25:40.770]  And that was the local white Russian.
[01:25:41.230 --> 01:25:41.430]  Right.
[01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:42.752]  Correct.
[01:25:42.912 --> 01:25:48.698]  There's documents pertaining to Oswald's mysterious appearance in Mexico City.
[01:25:49.078 --> 01:25:57.086]  We have Lyndon Baines Johnson on the phone with J. Edgar Hoover when Hoover says, Mr. President, the man in Mexico doesn't look like Oswald.
[01:25:58.257 --> 01:26:00.419]  Time for an answer as to what he meant by that.
[01:26:00.759 --> 01:26:04.702]  What it means, of course, is that the security camera footage seems to be missing.
[01:26:04.722 --> 01:26:05.783]  Sure, we're almost out of time.
[01:26:06.263 --> 01:26:07.384]  We'll put it back on screen.
[01:26:07.664 --> 01:26:14.889]  Then we have the J. Edgar Hoover memo saying George Herbert Walker Bush of the CIA in Texas on JFK, you know, I want to contact him.
[01:26:15.210 --> 01:26:16.791]  I mean, we have these documents that have come out.
[01:26:17.051 --> 01:26:18.412]  We're going to put that on screen for TV viewers.
[01:26:18.612 --> 01:26:19.273]  Let me ask you this.
[01:26:19.573 --> 01:26:21.394]  Why is everything coming out now?
[01:26:21.734 --> 01:26:23.636]  Why is populism winning everywhere?
[01:26:23.996 --> 01:26:25.276]  What is going on?
[01:26:25.396 --> 01:26:27.357]  I mean, it's spectacular!
[01:26:27.997 --> 01:26:30.757]  I didn't know we'd start kicking their butts this fast, Roger.
[01:26:30.797 --> 01:26:31.618]  This is amazing!
[01:26:32.258 --> 01:26:50.862]  Well, because we have an anti-establishment president who knows his own mind, who's a gut populist, and who understands that the American people are tired of the lies of the two-party duopoly, the neoconglobalists who have run this country in the... And they say he's mentally ill because he wants America to be first and isn't out to get us.
[01:26:51.262 --> 01:26:52.422]  I mean, I read this stuff and I'm seeing...
[01:26:53.442 --> 01:27:00.748]  What I don't like is the way the Washington Post and the New York Times referred to both you and I last week as conspiracy theorists.
[01:27:00.788 --> 01:27:01.548]  Let's address this.
[01:27:01.949 --> 01:27:07.673]  First of all, we have a memo written in 1964 by the Central Intelligence Agency instructing their media assets.
[01:27:08.093 --> 01:27:15.579]  Anytime anyone disagrees with the government's conclusions regarding the Kennedy assassination, call them a conspiracy theorist.
[01:27:15.639 --> 01:27:17.380]  It's an attempt to discredit us.
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:18.741]  And they still do it today!
[01:27:18.781 --> 01:27:20.462]  They still follow the old order today!
[01:27:21.803 --> 01:27:24.365]  But let's talk about some real conspiracy theories.
[01:27:24.865 --> 01:27:27.327]  Like, the Russians helped Donald Trump get elected.
[01:27:27.387 --> 01:27:28.828]  There's a conspiracy theory.
[01:27:29.268 --> 01:27:32.890]  Or Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone nut communist who acted alone.
[01:27:33.250 --> 01:27:34.371]  There's a conspiracy theory.
[01:27:34.431 --> 01:27:38.133]  Or there's WMDs in Iraq and, you know, Niger uranium and anthrax.
[01:27:38.373 --> 01:27:39.434]  Let me ask you this in closing.
[01:27:39.474 --> 01:27:40.315]  We only have one minute left.
[01:27:40.595 --> 01:27:40.835]  Go ahead.
[01:27:41.155 --> 01:27:44.539]  George W. Bush is our largest conspiracy theory president.
[01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:49.144]  He told us they had yellow cake uranium and that they had weapons of mass destruction.
[01:27:49.184 --> 01:27:53.029]  He lied us into war on the basis of a conspiracy theory.
[01:27:53.569 --> 01:27:54.210]  Very sad.
[01:27:54.791 --> 01:27:55.191]  Pathetic.
[01:27:56.112 --> 01:28:15.266]  Exactly, and now it's just a bunch, I mean you look at that photo of Lady Gaga on the old Presidents, in closing, 30 seconds, what do you make of, it's in the New York Post, Jimmy Carter came out against the Clintons, came out against Obama and said they're all full of it, that Americans want populism and that Trump was elected by Americans and Russia wasn't involved.
[01:28:15.487 --> 01:28:17.168]  Jimmy Carter just turned against him.
[01:28:17.208 --> 01:28:18.109]  What's going on?
[01:28:18.889 --> 01:28:21.630]  Jimmy Carter, like Ronald Reagan, was an outsider.
[01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:25.491]  He was controlled by the deep state, but he was never one of them.
[01:28:26.051 --> 01:28:29.392]  And unlike the rest of them, he never profiteered personally.
[01:28:29.672 --> 01:28:31.333]  He never lined his own pockets.
[01:28:31.353 --> 01:28:33.994]  He never became a rich man, nor did his crony.
[01:28:34.014 --> 01:28:36.014]  So he might have made mistakes, but he's not a bad guy.
[01:28:36.955 --> 01:28:37.735]  He was honest.
[01:28:37.835 --> 01:28:40.356]  He never stole a dime, unlike the Bush.
[01:28:41.016 --> 01:28:43.477]  So do you think he sees Trump in himself being a maverick?
[01:28:45.999 --> 01:28:46.920]  He was a Christian.
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:48.261]  He was an honest man.
[01:28:48.321 --> 01:28:50.643]  He just had a misguided political philosophy.
[01:28:50.683 --> 01:28:52.285]  But he was not evil.
[01:28:52.785 --> 01:28:55.587]  He was controlled by... And now he stands with Trump.
[01:28:55.828 --> 01:28:56.528]  It's a big choice.
[01:28:56.568 --> 01:28:57.229]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:28:57.489 --> 01:28:57.989]  Incredible.
[01:28:58.009 --> 01:28:59.270]  We'll be back with Key Intel.
[01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:00.251]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:29:00.271 --> 01:29:00.872]  This is powerful.
[01:29:04.522 --> 01:29:08.925]  You may already know a lot of what Stefan Molyneux is talking about, or what I'm talking about, and I get that.
[01:29:09.205 --> 01:29:13.409]  When I'm preaching at idiots out there, I'm talking to the lost sheep.
[01:29:13.469 --> 01:29:16.811]  I'm talking to the prodigal sons, because we know you're already awake.
[01:29:17.191 --> 01:29:18.853]  It's the folks that we're really trying to reach out to.
[01:29:18.873 --> 01:29:24.837]  But the Art of the Argument, Stefan Molyneux, available right there on theartoftheargument.com.
[01:29:25.497 --> 01:29:30.660]  Well, the goal, of course, is that we wish to negotiate, according to reason and evidence, our differences.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:34.182]  All people are going to have differences, and that's productive, you know?
[01:29:34.242 --> 01:29:36.543]  It is the sparks that sharpen the sword.
[01:29:36.563 --> 01:29:45.007]  It is the creative destruction of rational disagreement that moves our species forward and upwards in morality, in rationality, and civilization.
[01:29:45.567 --> 01:29:47.688]  So we basically are always going to have disagreements.
[01:29:47.748 --> 01:29:56.532]  We're either going to resolve them according to reason and evidence or we're going to have to use the fist, the gun, the club, the state in one form or another.
[01:29:56.593 --> 01:30:05.557]  And of course my goal in writing the book and in publicizing the book is to get people to understand how essential arguments are to civilization.
[01:30:05.597 --> 01:30:11.440]  They are civilization and the art of the argument is a way to convince people
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:12.720]  With no threats.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.761]  It's a way to convince people with no force.
[01:30:15.301 --> 01:30:21.204]  And it gives you your best chance at advancing your arguments in an increasingly anti-rational society.
[01:30:21.284 --> 01:30:26.886]  Civilization works when we listen to each other, we commit to rationality, and we submit to the better argument.
[01:30:26.966 --> 01:30:28.347]  That's how you... You can't lose an argument!
[01:30:28.387 --> 01:30:28.667]  We're good.
[01:30:45.527 --> 01:30:48.070]  And we're not allowed to speak our minds and we're not allowed to be honest.
[01:30:48.090 --> 01:30:49.511]  We're not allowed to engage in debate.
[01:30:49.551 --> 01:30:52.714]  We have to falsify everything about ourselves every day.
[01:30:53.095 --> 01:30:58.480]  We have to pretend and mouth slogans we pretend to conform to and mouth slogans that we find despicable.
[01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:02.264]  We have to kneel down before mediocrities and non-entities and idiots.
[01:31:02.544 --> 01:31:08.350]  And we have to live in fear of negative repercussions just for being honestly and authentically ourselves.
[01:31:08.850 --> 01:31:14.076]  Anybody who doesn't find that a literal hell is not somebody who's even worthy of being free.
[01:31:14.096 --> 01:31:15.178]  But I would find it a hell.
[01:31:15.238 --> 01:31:18.201]  I suspect most of your listeners would find that a kind of living hell as well.
[01:31:18.241 --> 01:31:25.650]  To have to lie and bow and scrape and falsify means you've got to kowtow to ridiculous slogans that are so illogical.
[01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:27.651]  It's completely ridiculous.
[01:31:27.691 --> 01:31:38.460]  And you have to falsify everything, live in fear, live as a slave, live as tax livestock so that your productivity gets grabbed off and shoveled off to people who are going to vote for more and more people to oppress you.
[01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:39.981]  You'll never be able to tell the truth.
[01:31:40.221 --> 01:31:41.702]  You'll never be able to be honest.
[01:31:41.722 --> 01:31:43.464]  You'll never be able to be authentic.
[01:31:43.784 --> 01:31:46.146]  And that is what a zombie life is like.
[01:31:46.546 --> 01:31:49.409]  No truth, no honor, no dignity, no love.
[01:31:50.269 --> 01:31:51.331]  No virtue!
[01:31:51.592 --> 01:32:00.348]  That is the kind of living death we are condemned to at an emotional level if we lose, and that's why I'll do almost anything to win.
[01:32:00.368 --> 01:32:00.849]  Wow.

[01:33:05.847 --> 01:33:08.488]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.272 --> 01:33:29.030]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.035 --> 01:33:44.298]  One of the most important things we do here at InfoWars is break down to the viewers and listeners how the mass media manipulates, how they deceive.
[01:33:44.918 --> 01:34:01.102]  We take you behind the scenes and basically show you the hat trick that the magician is using so that we can basically alert the public so they're aware of these scams so the fake news media cannot continue to get away with it over and over and over again.
[01:34:01.622 --> 01:34:04.924]  And a great example of this was just last week.
[01:34:04.984 --> 01:34:09.087]  A wonderful, though sad, opportunity to expose what they're up to.
[01:34:09.807 --> 01:34:17.953]  We saw President Trump making phone calls to the wives and to the widows and family members.
[01:34:19.121 --> 01:34:19.621]  I don't think so.
[01:34:42.739 --> 01:34:48.283]  Then, of course, Gold Star families released phone calls that were similar to what this phone call had been like.
[01:34:48.323 --> 01:34:51.245]  It was actually very, very gracious the way he said it.
[01:34:51.825 --> 01:35:03.813]  And it was General Kelly, who lost his own son a few years ago in the Marines, who basically told the president how best he thought it would be for the president to basically do it.
[01:35:04.033 --> 01:35:10.878]  But he went further and said, Mr. President, most presidents don't actually call people, and this is really tough for you to do, and I recommend you don't do it.
[01:35:11.218 --> 01:35:12.459]  But Trump went ahead and did it.
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:14.445]  So this is bigger than Trump.
[01:35:14.485 --> 01:35:17.917]  This is about the anatomy of deception because now this...
[01:35:19.079 --> 01:35:24.101]  Congresswoman has come out and said that she's a rock star now that this happened.
[01:35:24.381 --> 01:35:31.745]  And is really, really proud of all the fawning attention that fake news media like MSNBC and CNN and ABC have given her.
[01:35:32.005 --> 01:35:33.085]  A total disconnect.
[01:35:33.105 --> 01:35:35.466]  She doesn't get most American state and mainstream media.
[01:35:35.746 --> 01:35:39.888]  She doesn't get that her butt's hanging out there in front of the world and people see right through her.
[01:35:40.168 --> 01:35:48.052]  And that she took this death of this soldier and then used it to project hatred upon the President.
[01:35:48.928 --> 01:36:03.118]  Now the rest of the story, I'm going to play part of the press conference that Kelly gave, is that in their attempt to demonize and lie, they've now expanded it on to General Kelly and said, oh my gosh, you know, he is this terrible person.
[01:36:03.138 --> 01:36:06.039]  He's shown his true colors, is what CNN said.
[01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:10.803]  He's shown us he's really a Make America Great Again guy, and with horror.
[01:36:11.483 --> 01:36:30.696]  In these articles and in these reports, they talk about what a terrible person he is, because he believes we shouldn't use the deaths of soldiers to make political points, or he believes that religion should be honored, or that women should be honored, or that children should be honored, or, you know, the institution of manhood, you name it.
[01:36:30.856 --> 01:36:35.119]  That humanity should be honored, that the right to life should be honored.
[01:36:35.359 --> 01:36:40.482]  He talked about honoring humanity, having respect for ourselves, and it's CNN
[01:36:41.623 --> 01:36:57.610]  And others that showed us their true colors when they flipped out and acted like the wholesome things that General Kelly said were some type of horrible pornography or something obscene, something obscene that was being said and done.
[01:36:58.671 --> 01:37:07.435]  It's really the Washington Post and CNN and mainstream corporate dinosaur media that are showing us their true colors when they flip out.
[01:37:08.536 --> 01:37:14.080]  Over someone saying, let's not be political in America when it comes to deaths of soldiers.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:18.803]  Let's not insert ourselves between grieving families and the president.
[01:37:19.383 --> 01:37:23.226]  Let's have something that's still sacrosanct and honored in this country.
[01:37:24.587 --> 01:37:34.654]  And as if not to be undone after all of her rock star bandwagon, you know, really vampire-like behavior.
[01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:52.933]  The psychic vampire, Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, comes back again now, this weekend, and says that the general was racist when he said that the loudest guns tend to be empty barrels.
[01:37:53.954 --> 01:37:55.695]  That's just saying that she's a loudmouth.
[01:37:56.116 --> 01:37:58.958]  That's just saying she jumps on bandwagons and that she's an idiot.
[01:38:00.063 --> 01:38:18.129]  But again, because she can't intellectually defeat what he said and what he's done, and because she's been caught lying about the tenor of what President Trump really does in these heartfelt phone calls, she's got to go back to the only card that the liberal, democratic, globalist party has, and that's race baiting.
[01:38:18.809 --> 01:38:23.911]  And to see folks like this lady falling on her face is just absolutely disgusting.
[01:38:24.391 --> 01:38:28.513]  You know, there's a congressman up in Georgia, who happens to be black, who believes that islands float.
[01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:35.558]  And when the media pointed out that islands don't float, they're mountaintops sticking out of the water, some folks said, well, you're just racist.
[01:38:35.818 --> 01:38:40.705]  No, Nancy Pelosi's just as senile and mentally ill as these folks as well, and she's white.
[01:38:41.906 --> 01:38:44.269]  And there's some other members of Congress that are also out of their minds.
[01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:46.332]  We've just got to be asking ourselves,
[01:38:47.293 --> 01:38:51.594]  How have we gotten a collection of weirdos like this in charge of our country?
[01:38:52.214 --> 01:39:14.440]  So I'm going to air the first 10 minutes or so of General Kelly's breakdown, and then for yourself, go to Infowars.com, watch some posts, you name it, and actually see similar phone calls that Gold Star families have taped, where you see how gracious and loving the President is when he's saying, hey, he was with you, wanted to be with, he was a leader, he gave his life for us, what a hero.
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:21.804]  Most Americans don't know what happens when we lose one of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, or coast guardsmen in combat.
[01:39:21.844 --> 01:39:23.285]  So let me tell you what happens.
[01:39:23.305 --> 01:39:23.745]  They're buddies.
[01:39:43.897 --> 01:39:49.939]  Wrapped them up in whatever passes as a shroud, puts them on a helicopter as a routine, and sends them home.
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:40:12.986]  Their first stop along the way is when they're packed in ice, typically at the airhead, and then they're flown to, usually Europe, where they're then packed in ice again and flown to Dover Air Force Base, where Dover takes care of the remains,
[01:40:14.196 --> 01:40:30.788]  Uh, embalms them, uh, meticulously dresses them in their uniform with the revel- with the medals that they've earned, the emblems of their service, and then puts them on another airplane linked up with a casualty officer escort that takes them home.
[01:40:31.949 --> 01:40:39.711]  A very, very good movie to watch if you haven't ever seen it is Taking Chance, where this is done in a movie HBO setting.
[01:40:40.271 --> 01:40:43.672]  Chance Phelps was killed under my command right next to me.
[01:40:44.012 --> 01:40:45.632]  It's worth seeing that if you've never seen it.
[01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:47.113]  So that's the process.
[01:40:47.793 --> 01:40:57.235]  While that's happening, a casualty officer typically goes to the home very early in the morning and waits for the first lights to come on.
[01:40:58.336 --> 01:40:59.316]  And then he knocks on the door.
[01:41:00.438 --> 01:41:02.939]  Typically the mom and dad will answer, wife.
[01:41:03.899 --> 01:41:06.300]  And if there is a wife, this is happening in two different places.
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:08.281]  If the parents are divorced, three different places.
[01:41:10.141 --> 01:41:24.106]  And the casualty officer proceeds to break the heart of a family member and stays with that family until, well, for a long, long time, even after the internment.
[01:41:25.446 --> 01:41:26.246]  So that's what happens.
[01:41:26.487 --> 01:41:27.627]  Who are these young men and women?
[01:41:28.717 --> 01:41:30.857]  They are the best 1% this country produces.
[01:41:31.557 --> 01:41:35.498]  Most of you, as Americans, don't know them.
[01:41:36.418 --> 01:41:39.459]  Many of you don't know anyone who knows any one of them.
[01:41:40.099 --> 01:41:42.119]  But they are the very best this country produces.
[01:41:42.839 --> 01:41:55.181]  And they volunteer to protect our country when there's nothing in our country anymore that seems to suggest that selfless service to the nation is not only appropriate but required.
[01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:56.102]  But that's alright.
[01:41:59.295 --> 01:42:01.236]  Who writes letters to the families?
[01:42:01.976 --> 01:42:13.882]  Typically, the company commander, in my case as a Marine, the company commander, battalion commander, regimental commander, division commander, secretary of defense, typically the service chief coming out of the Marine Corps, and the president, typically writes a letter.
[01:42:15.083 --> 01:42:20.626]  Typically, the only phone calls the family receives are the most important phone calls they can imagine, and that is from their buddies.
[01:42:20.686 --> 01:42:26.889]  In my case, hours after my son was killed, his friends were calling us from Afghanistan.
[01:42:27.981 --> 01:42:29.502]  Telling us what a great guy he was.
[01:42:30.242 --> 01:42:33.604]  Those are the only phone calls that really matter.
[01:42:34.124 --> 01:42:43.609]  And yeah, the letters count to a degree, but there's not much that really can take the edge off what a family member's going through.
[01:42:44.729 --> 01:42:49.612]  So, some presidents have elected to call.
[01:42:50.292 --> 01:42:53.154]  All presidents, I believe, have elected to send letters.
[01:42:54.495 --> 01:42:59.019]  Um, if you elect to call a family like this, it is about the most difficult thing you could imagine.
[01:43:02.982 --> 01:43:04.363]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:43:04.383 --> 01:43:05.924]  You can't survive without it.
[01:43:06.125 --> 01:43:07.045]  But where do you get it?

[01:47:05.825 --> 01:47:08.466]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.437 --> 01:47:19.380]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:22.702 --> 01:47:25.083]  There's no perfect way to make that phone call.
[01:47:27.484 --> 01:47:37.550]  When I took this job and talked to President Trump about how to do it, my first recommendation was, he not do it.
[01:47:40.013 --> 01:47:45.535]  Because it's not the phone call that parents, family members are looking forward to.
[01:47:46.375 --> 01:47:48.236]  It's nice to do, in my opinion, in any event.
[01:47:49.736 --> 01:47:51.697]  He asked me about previous presidents.
[01:47:52.217 --> 01:48:00.160]  And I said, I can tell you that President Obama, who was my commander-in-chief when I was on active duty, did not call my family.
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:01.220]  That was not a criticism.
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:04.961]  That was just to simply say, I don't believe President Obama called.
[01:48:05.622 --> 01:48:06.682]  That's not a negative thing.
[01:48:08.537 --> 01:48:11.500]  I don't believe President Bush called in all cases.
[01:48:13.261 --> 01:48:18.645]  I don't believe any president, particularly when the casualty rates are very, very high, that presidents call.
[01:48:20.006 --> 01:48:21.027]  But I believe they're all right.
[01:48:22.068 --> 01:48:34.137]  So when I gave that explanation to our president three days ago, he elected to make phone calls in the case of the four young men who he lost in Niger at the earlier part of this month.
[01:48:35.504 --> 01:48:37.726]  Then he said, you know, how do you make these calls?
[01:48:39.588 --> 01:48:48.316]  If you're not in the family, if you've never worn the uniform, if you've never been in combat, you can't even imagine how to make that call.
[01:48:48.937 --> 01:48:51.760]  But I think he very bravely does make those calls.
[01:48:54.362 --> 01:48:55.463]  The call in question
[01:48:56.668 --> 01:49:03.330]  Uh, that he made yesterday, um, or day before yesterday now, were to four family members, the four fallen.
[01:49:04.210 --> 01:49:07.951]  And remember, there's an extra kin designated by the individual.
[01:49:08.191 --> 01:49:10.451]  If he's married, that's typically the spouse.
[01:49:11.291 --> 01:49:14.392]  If he's not married, that's typically the parents, unless the parents are divorced.
[01:49:14.892 --> 01:49:16.533]  And then he selects one of them.
[01:49:16.593 --> 01:49:19.693]  If he didn't get along with his parents, he'll sit, he'll select a sibling.
[01:49:19.993 --> 01:49:22.914]  But the point is the phone call is made to the, um,
[01:49:24.721 --> 01:49:29.364]  The next of kin only if the next of kin agrees to take the phone call.
[01:49:29.384 --> 01:49:30.105]  Sometimes they don't.
[01:49:31.245 --> 01:49:36.229]  So a pre-call is made, the President of the United States or the Commandant of the Marine Corps or someone would like to call.
[01:49:36.809 --> 01:49:37.690]  Will you accept the call?
[01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:40.151]  And typically they all accept the call.
[01:49:40.932 --> 01:49:45.975]  So he called four people the other day and expressed his condolences in the best way that he could.
[01:49:47.697 --> 01:49:49.618]  And he said to me, what do I say?
[01:49:52.212 --> 01:49:56.215]  I said to him, sir, there's nothing you can do to lighten the burden on these families.
[01:49:57.756 --> 01:50:00.297]  But let me tell you what I told him.
[01:50:00.458 --> 01:50:05.922]  Let me tell you what my best friend Joe Dunford told me, because he was my casualty officer.
[01:50:07.843 --> 01:50:17.090]  He said, Kel, he was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed.
[01:50:19.071 --> 01:50:20.112]  He knew what he was getting into.
[01:50:20.936 --> 01:50:22.037]  By joining that 1%.
[01:50:23.618 --> 01:50:25.319]  He knew what the possibilities were.
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:26.900]  Because we're at war.
[01:50:29.021 --> 01:50:37.887]  And when he died, in the four cases we're talking about, and I assure my son's case in Afghanistan, when he died he was surrounded by the best men on this earth.
[01:50:38.428 --> 01:50:38.888]  His friends.
[01:50:40.569 --> 01:50:44.792]  That's what the president tried to say to four families the other day.
[01:50:46.473 --> 01:50:47.334]  I was stunned.
[01:50:49.076 --> 01:50:54.921]  When I came to work yesterday morning and brokenhearted at what I saw a member of Congress doing.
[01:50:54.941 --> 01:51:02.428]  A member of Congress who listened in on a phone call from the President of the United States to a young wife.
[01:51:03.729 --> 01:51:07.192]  And in his way tried to express that opinion.
[01:51:08.553 --> 01:51:09.374]  That he's a brave man.
[01:51:09.394 --> 01:51:11.055]  A fallen hero.
[01:51:12.377 --> 01:51:14.679]  He knew what he was getting himself into because he enlisted.
[01:51:14.699 --> 01:51:15.679]  There's no reason to enlist.
[01:51:15.719 --> 01:51:16.140]  He enlisted.
[01:51:17.435 --> 01:51:24.877]  And he was where he wanted to be, exactly where he wanted to be, with exactly the people he wanted to be with when his life was taken.
[01:51:25.457 --> 01:51:26.357]  That was the message.
[01:51:27.037 --> 01:51:28.638]  That was the message that was transmitted.
[01:51:29.778 --> 01:51:33.939]  It stuns me that a member of Congress would have listened in on that conversation.
[01:51:35.039 --> 01:51:36.340]  Absolutely stuns me.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:40.081]  And I thought, at least that was sacred.
[01:51:40.101 --> 01:51:44.842]  You know, when I was a kid growing up, a lot of things were sacred in our country.
[01:51:46.744 --> 01:51:49.806]  Women were sacred and looked upon with great honor.
[01:51:49.826 --> 01:51:53.028]  That's obviously not the case anymore as we see from recent cases.
[01:51:53.488 --> 01:51:56.110]  Life, the dignity of life, is sacred.
[01:51:56.130 --> 01:51:56.550]  That's gone.
[01:51:57.150 --> 01:52:00.092]  Religion, that seems to be gone as well.
[01:52:01.233 --> 01:52:04.695]  Gold star families, I think that left in the convention over the summer.
[01:52:06.196 --> 01:52:13.901]  I just thought the selfless devotion that brings a man or woman to die on the battlefield, I just thought that that might be sacred.
[01:52:15.296 --> 01:52:28.779]  When I listened to this woman, what she was saying, what she was doing on TV, the only thing I could do to collect my thoughts was to go and walk among the finest men and women on this earth.
[01:52:29.659 --> 01:52:32.660]  And you can always find them, because they're in Arlington National Cemetery.
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:41.122]  Went over there for an hour and a half, walked among the stones, some of whom I put there, because they were doing what I told them to do when they were killed.
[01:52:45.408 --> 01:52:46.089]  I'll end with this.
[01:52:47.029 --> 01:52:56.858]  In October, April, rather, of 2015, I was still on active duty, and I went to the dedication of the new FBI field office in Miami.
[01:53:00.754 --> 01:53:07.375]  It was dedicated to two men who were killed in a firefight in Miami against drug traffickers in 1986.
[01:53:07.655 --> 01:53:12.717]  A guy by the name of Grogan in Duke.
[01:53:13.577 --> 01:53:17.417]  Grogan almost retired, 53 years old, Duke, I think less than a year on the job.
[01:53:17.478 --> 01:53:19.578]  Anyways, they got in a gunfight and they were killed.
[01:53:20.038 --> 01:53:23.939]  Three other FBI agents were there, were wounded, now retired.
[01:53:24.795 --> 01:53:37.386]  So we go down, Jim Comey did an absolutely brilliant memorial speech to those fallen men and to all of the men and women of the FBI who serve our country so well, and law enforcement so well.
[01:53:38.947 --> 01:53:40.108]  There were family members there.
[01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:48.456]  Some of the children that were there were only three or four years old when their dads were killed on that street in Miami-Dade.
[01:53:51.255 --> 01:53:57.559]  Three of the men that survived the fight were there, and gave a rendition of how brave those men were, and how they gave their lives.
[01:54:01.722 --> 01:54:12.310]  And a congresswoman stood up, and in the long tradition of empty barrels making the most noise, stood up there in all of that.
[01:54:13.553 --> 01:54:19.114]  And talked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building.
[01:54:19.134 --> 01:54:22.775]  And how she took care of her constituents because she got the money.
[01:54:22.815 --> 01:54:28.557]  And she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call, he gave the money, the $20 million to build the building.
[01:54:29.057 --> 01:54:29.617]  She sat down.
[01:54:30.957 --> 01:54:31.697]  And we were stunned.
[01:54:33.198 --> 01:54:34.418]  Stunned that she'd done it.
[01:54:35.538 --> 01:54:38.659]  Even for someone that is that empty a barrel.
[01:54:39.701 --> 01:54:40.321]  We were stunned.
[01:54:40.862 --> 01:54:43.383]  But you know, none of us went to the press and criticized.
[01:54:45.444 --> 01:54:46.964]  None of us stood up and were appalled.
[01:54:47.745 --> 01:54:49.906]  We just said, OK, fine.
[01:54:51.066 --> 01:55:06.233]  So I still hope, as you write your stories, and I appeal to America, that let's not let this maybe last thing that's held sacred in our society, a young man, young woman going out
[01:55:07.654 --> 01:55:12.539]  As we end this special broadcast today, I personally am just sitting back and analyzing
[01:55:30.871 --> 01:55:37.677]  How illustrative all of this is to exactly where our civilization and where our species is today on this planet.
[01:55:38.017 --> 01:55:44.823]  This is one of those stories that just opens up the windows of understanding into the mindset of ourselves, but also the globalists.
[01:55:45.463 --> 01:55:50.707]  This lady doesn't care about using dead service members to advance her agenda.
[01:55:50.887 --> 01:55:51.928]  She doesn't care about lying.
[01:55:52.249 --> 01:55:56.672]  And she loves being a, quote, rock star in the failed media system.
[01:55:57.033 --> 01:55:57.913]  So it illustrates how
[01:55:58.934 --> 01:56:02.963]  The crumbling power structure is still betting on CNN and MSNBC.
[01:56:03.444 --> 01:56:04.386]  And that's why they're losing.
[01:56:04.647 --> 01:56:07.994]  Because they're so delusional, they're so senile, they're so disconnected.
[01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:15.948]  And it also illustrates to us how much disdain they have for the American people and what they really think about us.
[01:56:16.689 --> 01:56:30.004]  Because I recently saw Bill Maher out there bitching and complaining and getting in his viewers' faces for the fact that they don't listen to him or mainstream media, but that people online actually collect their own news and their own information and come to their own decisions.
[01:56:31.883 --> 01:56:33.945]  It's basically OCD.
[01:56:34.045 --> 01:56:43.936]  It's stagnant power structure that can't stop doing things in the same way over and over again, and can't see how ridiculous they look in front of everybody else.
[01:56:44.536 --> 01:56:46.358]  That's why the whole power structure is coming down.
[01:56:46.739 --> 01:56:49.822]  Please join me tomorrow with the syndicated live transmission, 11 a.m.
[01:56:49.842 --> 01:56:50.703]  to 3 p.m.

[01:56:53.626 --> 01:56:57.629]  And don't forget, David Knight's now kicked off his own syndicated radio-slash-TV transmission.
[01:56:57.649 --> 01:56:58.749]  8 a.m.
[01:56:58.769 --> 01:57:02.752]  to 11 a.m., weekdays, right before I go live with the Real News with David Knight.

[01:57:20.226 --> 01:57:28.190]  You mean to tell me that I have become so important that the White House is following me?
[01:57:28.610 --> 01:57:30.791]  In my words, this is amazing!
[01:57:31.432 --> 01:57:32.192]  It's amazing.
[01:57:33.013 --> 01:57:34.833]  That is absolutely phenomenal.
[01:57:35.014 --> 01:57:38.095]  I have to tell my kids that I'm a rock star now.
[01:57:38.395 --> 01:57:39.936]  That I'm a rock star now.
[01:57:40.436 --> 01:57:41.757]  That I'm a rock star now.
[01:57:42.277 --> 01:57:43.598]  That I'm a rock star now.
[01:57:44.398 --> 01:57:47.700]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:57:52.398 --> 01:57:54.779]  And we're not getting what humans always thought was tea.
[01:57:54.980 --> 01:57:55.700]  The bone broth.
[01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:57.121]  The bone broth.
[01:57:57.781 --> 01:57:59.322]  The bone broth.
[01:57:59.542 --> 01:58:00.283]  The bone broth.
[01:58:00.583 --> 01:58:01.223]  The bone broth.
[01:58:01.984 --> 01:58:02.724]  The bone broth.
[01:58:03.264 --> 01:58:04.885]  Well, now it's the next level of that.
[01:58:04.985 --> 01:58:05.666]  It's caveman.
[01:58:06.366 --> 01:58:07.707]  Hey, I need a glass of caveman.
[01:58:08.087 --> 01:58:08.648]  Caveman.
[01:58:09.148 --> 01:58:09.408]  Mmm.
[01:58:09.828 --> 01:58:10.048]  Mmm.
[01:58:10.669 --> 01:58:11.149]  Mmm, man.
[01:58:11.229 --> 01:58:11.489]  Mmm.
[01:58:11.849 --> 01:58:12.810]  It's better than Ovaltine.
[01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:13.931]  Better than Ovaltine.
[01:58:14.031 --> 01:58:14.131]  Mmm.
[01:58:14.411 --> 01:58:15.512]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:58:15.992 --> 01:58:16.773]  It's unbelievable.
[01:58:17.494 --> 01:58:19.135]  Caveman is just over the top.
[01:58:19.636 --> 01:58:21.377]  What in the world?
[01:58:21.417 --> 01:58:24.300]  But now with the milk, I was like, whoa, this has milk in it.
[01:58:25.321 --> 01:58:26.382]  It tastes like good.
[01:58:26.682 --> 01:58:27.523]  Man, this tastes so good.
[01:58:28.764 --> 01:58:29.925]  Tastes like the best milkshake ever.
[01:58:31.066 --> 01:58:32.387]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:58:32.467 --> 01:58:33.588]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:58:33.848 --> 01:58:35.330]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:58:35.370 --> 01:58:36.150]  Like good.
[01:58:36.591 --> 01:58:37.772]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:58:43.593 --> 01:58:50.240]  I can say without a doubt, at least in my experience, this is a super home run available at InfoWarsLife.com and it supports the broadcast.
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:51.962]  Alright, all the big news straight ahead.
