[00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:08.482]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:18.350]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, they say in the Bible, in the end days, people will run to and fro frantically, and the time will speed up.
[00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:21.133]  And it kind of feels like that right now.
[00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:24.338]  We've got David Knight in the other studio.
[00:00:24.398 --> 00:00:30.205]  He's been on the last hour or two hours with live coverage of the historic Comey testimony.
[00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:37.052]  And I've got both the Nightly News crew and the radio crew in here frantically scrambling and doing an incredible job.
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:55.669]  Grabbing bombshell clip, after bombshell clip, after bombshell clip, and most of the mainstream media is actually ignoring these bombshells, but Donald Trump Jr., that Matt Drudge is linked to, and that we're linked to, is tweeting basically what we're saying in live time, but not because he's watching us.
[00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.150]  He has sent some of our tweets out.
[00:00:57.931 --> 00:00:59.912]  It's because the same thing's happening.
[00:01:00.828 --> 00:01:10.090]  As I'm sitting there writing the tweets, trying to get ready for the show, but I can't even get ready because I'm watching the hearing, I tweet out, did you just see what Comey said?
[00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.171]  He says he gave his friends the memos to give to the press.
[00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:16.552]  He just admitted he's one of the main leakers!
[00:01:17.012 --> 00:01:18.492]  Incredible bombshell!
[00:01:19.252 --> 00:01:21.173]  We are exporting that clip off C-SPAN.
[00:01:21.193 --> 00:01:26.614]  When I walked in here two minutes ago, it was on the computer exporting over so we can play it for you.
[00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:29.733]  We don't have the big giant, you know, Instant Replay Studios.
[00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:41.742]  Then, about 40 minutes ago, the even bigger bombshell, he totally, absolutely, completely admitted that he committed perjury to Congress.
[00:01:42.283 --> 00:01:45.365]  He said, I have been influenced, they have tried to influence me.
[00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:48.348]  Going back to his memo in February, when two
[00:01:49.645 --> 00:01:53.789]  Months later, on May 3rd, he says, no one ever tried to influence me.
[00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.032]  This is incredible.
[00:01:56.673 --> 00:02:08.705]  Now, if you want to hear and see the feed without the radio show or the ads, we've got live, continual coverage right into the next hour when they then go into closed session in the Senate.
[00:02:09.597 --> 00:02:09.677]  of
[00:02:39.957 --> 00:02:40.738]  And I'll tell you why.
[00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:52.251]  You want to probably hear it, some of you, but also I have got to get in that control room because there are like 11 clips that I was sweating over just in the last hour looking at these clips.
[00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:54.314]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:02:54.354 --> 00:02:55.635]  And we've got to get these on Twitter.
[00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:59.359]  We've got to get these up on YouTube so you can spread them fast.
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:15.711]  Infowars.com is going to have that front page war room in the next hour with Rob Dew and Michael Zimmerman and Travis Knight and everybody else in there grabbing these clips out while they run these two live TV slash radio shows.
[00:03:16.652 --> 00:03:18.633]  That's why we've got to grow the crew here at Infowars.
[00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:21.315]  That's why your sponsorship and support is more important than ever.
[00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:27.919]  Like Superblue, now in a better tube, higher quality, I mean it was already a great tube,
[00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.671]  A new, better tube, fluoride-free.
[00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:35.174]  It's got the colloidal silver.
[00:03:35.394 --> 00:03:37.536]  It's got the iodine in it.
[00:03:37.956 --> 00:03:39.518]  It's got the peppermint, the tea tree oil.
[00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:40.098]  It's amazing.
[00:03:40.158 --> 00:03:46.785]  And now back in stock with a tube I picked that I think is a better tube, softer tube, a little bit larger diameter.
[00:03:47.585 --> 00:03:48.366]  We're good to go.
[00:04:12.563 --> 00:04:18.907]  We're set off at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:04:19.148 --> 00:04:21.749]  And we are trying to hire a lot of new people.
[00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.912]  We're getting new engineers, new switchers, new editors, more reporters.
[00:04:25.972 --> 00:04:30.315]  We are really trying to expand to face the globalists because so much news is coming out.
[00:04:30.795 --> 00:04:31.796]  So much is unfolding.
[00:04:31.816 --> 00:04:37.160]  But when we return, when we return, the live coverage feed and then
[00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:40.915]  Kent Daniels has got the article going up as we speak.
[00:04:41.836 --> 00:04:44.417]  He already found the video, but he had to link to it in a larger clip.
[00:04:44.437 --> 00:04:49.759]  We're getting the clips up ourselves of him perjuring himself and admitting he's the leaker.
[00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:51.580]  Unbelievable!
[00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.672]  Check out these amazing deals at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:04:58.692 --> 00:05:07.778]  25% off BioTrue Selenium, a powerful antioxidant and back-in-stock super blue fluoride-free toothpaste.
[00:05:07.978 --> 00:05:09.879]  Now 33% off.
[00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:16.143]  And while you're there, check out the Total Oral Care Pack, which combines our organic mouthwash
[00:05:16.403 --> 00:05:36.283]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:05:36.863 --> 00:05:38.946]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[00:05:39.146 --> 00:05:41.949]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.711]  It's made in the USA.
[00:05:44.352 --> 00:05:52.762]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body, and it supports the info war.
[00:05:53.082 --> 00:05:54.324]  It is a classical 360 whip.
[00:05:55.525 --> 00:05:59.352]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:05:59.993 --> 00:06:06.564]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity,
[00:06:07.742 --> 00:06:08.443]  And of strength.
[00:06:09.404 --> 00:06:12.807]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:06:13.207 --> 00:06:20.793]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched in 4 Wars Life, to actually come up with this.
[00:06:21.594 --> 00:06:32.784]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:06:33.044 --> 00:06:47.501]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy.
[00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:48.722]  You owe it to yourself.
[00:06:49.483 --> 00:06:59.312]  You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:06:59.373 --> 00:07:07.640]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:07:07.841 --> 00:07:14.587]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the new world order.
[00:07:15.572 --> 00:07:19.355]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:07:19.816 --> 00:07:21.157]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[00:07:21.797 --> 00:07:23.559]  With Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:30.625]  You've got to have the will to accept the truth and buck the system and the group collective.
[00:07:31.706 --> 00:07:35.409]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:37.891]  This is the Infowar.
[00:08:11.834 --> 00:08:17.877]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:18.318 --> 00:08:19.838]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.382 --> 00:08:29.105]  Alright folks, we have got two different live transmissions going on right now.
[00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:35.709]  I'm going to cut over to the live coverage of Comey that David Knight is hosting during the breaks here in just a moment.
[00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:41.013]  We have Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas questioning the former FBI Director James Comey right now.
[00:08:41.713 --> 00:08:44.855]  Now, I'm going to go, here in just a minute or two, to the live feed.
[00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:49.258]  If you want a total, uninterrupted, commercial-free feed, it's at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:49.719 --> 00:08:54.462]  Our stations out there and other folks are welcome to pick that feed up that has limited commentary with David Knight.
[00:08:54.742 --> 00:08:58.985]  When I go to breaks today, you can also tune over to that feed if you'd like as well.
[00:08:59.265 --> 00:09:02.007]  Both feeds are on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:09:02.388 --> 00:09:05.150]  This is the live syndicated radio slash TV broadcast.
[00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.450]  This is InfoWars Live.
[00:09:06.711 --> 00:09:07.671]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:09:10.046 --> 00:09:19.249]  When we play 10-15 minutes of this, I'm going to come back, because we've got a big raft of clips, and our great crew on the TV side and the radio side have got all their own clips.
[00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:23.411]  We're going to come back and play, first off, two bombshell clips.
[00:09:25.198 --> 00:09:26.800]  That should be top headlines everywhere.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:37.509]  It came out of Comey's mouth, it's completely clear, and the only people that get it are Infowars.com, DrudgeReport.com that I've seen so far, and of course, Donald Trump Jr.
[00:09:37.589 --> 00:09:40.652]  is getting it and tweeting in live time exactly what we're seeing.
[00:09:41.212 --> 00:09:42.493]  I've been tweeting on my Twitter.
[00:09:43.348 --> 00:09:44.168]  At Real Alex Jones.
[00:09:44.309 --> 00:09:58.095]  Ladies and gentlemen, about 45 minutes ago, Comey said that the President did order him, and did try to basically influence him, something he said no one had ever tried to get him to do, but now he's spinning it semantically.
[00:09:58.135 --> 00:10:03.758]  But it's clearly perjury, one way or the other, because he said May 3rd, back from the February meetings, that that had never happened.
[00:10:04.178 --> 00:10:04.398]  Okay?
[00:10:08.049 --> 00:10:09.110]  That's one big issue.
[00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:14.032]  Even bigger is he said he gave memos to friends to give them to the press.
[00:10:14.872 --> 00:10:16.753]  I can't believe he said it.
[00:10:17.273 --> 00:10:20.155]  I saw him say it and almost had a heart attack.
[00:10:20.195 --> 00:10:22.176]  So, again, we've got all these live feeds going.
[00:10:22.196 --> 00:10:28.079]  We have to then go into the feed that we're archiving, grab it out, and then put it into the live feed back.
[00:10:28.319 --> 00:10:34.722]  So, right now I'm going to fade over to the other studio where David Knight is with live coverage with the live feed.
[00:10:35.822 --> 00:10:36.703]  But this is amazing.
[00:10:39.085 --> 00:10:40.126]  Examiner just got it.
[00:10:40.386 --> 00:10:43.289]  See, James Comey admits leaking his Trump memos to the press.
[00:10:43.649 --> 00:10:45.111]  This is incredible!
[00:10:46.552 --> 00:10:57.102]  But we've got the other incredible headline going up right now at Infowars.com that Comey committed perjury and in the same article we're gonna have the sub headline and he admits he leaked memos to the press.
[00:10:57.342 --> 00:10:58.663]  That is so illegal!
[00:10:59.043 --> 00:11:01.125]  That is such a national security violation!
[00:11:01.406 --> 00:11:02.647]  That is so unbelievable!
[00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:04.745]  Confirmed.
[00:11:04.785 --> 00:11:06.527]  Comey committed perjury to Congress.
[00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:07.948]  New York Times debunked.
[00:11:08.429 --> 00:11:11.613]  Trump didn't directly order end of Flynn investigation.
[00:11:12.474 --> 00:11:21.665]  That's powerful, but in the same article we have the video as well where he admits that he gave it to the press.
[00:11:25.444 --> 00:11:28.466]  In fact, here is the leaked memo clip now, then I'll go to the live feed.
[00:11:28.927 --> 00:11:29.467]  Here's the clip.
[00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:34.011]  President tweeted on Friday, after I got fired, that I better hope there's not tapes.
[00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:41.396]  I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night, because it didn't dawn on me originally, that there might be corroboration for our conversation.
[00:11:41.416 --> 00:11:42.277]  There might be a tape.
[00:11:42.837 --> 00:11:45.978]  And my judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square.
[00:11:46.078 --> 00:11:50.920]  And so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.
[00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:57.003]  Didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.
[00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.064]  And so I asked a close friend of mine to do it.
[00:11:59.244 --> 00:12:00.884]  And was Seth after the firing?
[00:12:01.205 --> 00:12:01.985]  No, no.
[00:12:02.225 --> 00:12:03.385]  Who was Seth?
[00:12:04.486 --> 00:12:06.847]  A good friend of mine who's a professor at Columbia Law School.
[00:12:08.624 --> 00:12:12.347]  That is so over-the-top sensational, I don't even know what to say.
[00:12:12.387 --> 00:12:14.289]  That is so illegal.
[00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:24.157]  And of course it came out at the time that Trump thought it was Comey, and when Trump was saying, give me loyalty, he meant stop leaking national security information.
[00:12:25.258 --> 00:12:33.866]  The FBI director committing crimes with the media, and he comes out and admits, in another clip we've got coming up, that Loretta Lynch did try to tell him.
[00:12:35.592 --> 00:12:37.213]  To leave Hillary alone on the emails.
[00:12:37.553 --> 00:12:38.413]  And he did!
[00:12:39.014 --> 00:12:40.615]  He did close the investigation.
[00:12:40.835 --> 00:12:45.297]  And she did go on that airplane with William Jefferson Clinton, former President of the United States.
[00:12:45.417 --> 00:12:49.199]  I mean, the crimes they are committing in front of everyone.
[00:12:49.319 --> 00:12:51.880]  I've never heard or seen anything like this.
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.142]  And he's doing it in a confidence game because he knows it's all coming out.
[00:12:55.422 --> 00:12:59.684]  He's saying it all to act like, yeah, I strangled my wife and buried her in the backyard.
[00:12:59.724 --> 00:13:00.244]  Big deal!
[00:13:00.485 --> 00:13:01.185]  Everybody does it.
[00:13:02.742 --> 00:13:07.146]  So let's go to the live feed with David Knight covering it and then I'm going to come back with the other clips.
[00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:10.609]  This has reeked from the beginning.
[00:13:10.649 --> 00:13:17.916]  This has stunk to high heaven and I am definitely hit peak point in my life in media covering stuff.
[00:13:17.936 --> 00:13:19.157]  I've never seen anything.
[00:13:19.497 --> 00:13:20.658]  This is so bonkers.
[00:13:21.078 --> 00:13:26.023]  This is so over the top because the media is going to act like Trump did something.
[00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:29.874]  Folks, this is so illegal.
[00:13:30.134 --> 00:13:33.915]  Let's go back, ladies and gentlemen, to the live feed.
[00:13:34.815 --> 00:13:36.516]  It's possible, but I don't remember any.
[00:13:37.056 --> 00:13:45.217]  Do you know if the Attorney General was involved, in fact involved, in any aspect of the Russia investigation after his recusal on the 2nd of March?
[00:13:46.637 --> 00:13:46.977]  I don't.
[00:13:47.017 --> 00:13:48.718]  I would assume not, but I don't.
[00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:50.098]  Let me say it this way.
[00:13:50.378 --> 00:13:56.119]  I don't know of any information that would lead me to believe he did something to touch the Russia investigation after the recusal.
[00:13:57.924 --> 00:14:02.886]  In your written testimony, you indicate that you... Again, this is Kamala Harris.
[00:14:02.926 --> 00:14:05.087]  She's a newly elected Democrat senator.
[00:14:05.107 --> 00:14:09.889]  She is trying to... First, she did a series of events saying, well, are you aware of this or this or this?
[00:14:09.909 --> 00:14:12.490]  And of course, he can't comment on any specifics of the investigation.
[00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:19.413]  So they can throw out any kind of unsubstantiated innuendo or allegation, and he'll have to say, well, I can't comment on that.
[00:14:19.433 --> 00:14:20.954]  So it sounds like they are true.
[00:14:21.374 --> 00:14:23.735]  Then she comes after Attorney General Sessions.
[00:14:24.255 --> 00:14:25.335]  When did he recuse himself?
[00:14:25.395 --> 00:14:26.856]  Did he have anything to do with this firing?
[00:14:27.416 --> 00:14:44.481]  And yet he's saying that, no, I don't see anything with that, I don't see anything that was political in my firing, with the exception of one point in which he seemed to contradict himself, which he did contradict himself, in his sworn testimony earlier, that there was no attempt to shut down the investigation for political purposes.
[00:14:44.561 --> 00:14:47.942]  I don't have a clear recollection of that.
[00:14:47.982 --> 00:14:49.082]  He didn't say anything.
[00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:56.564]  And on that same February 14th meeting, you said you understood the President to be requesting that you drop the investigation.
[00:14:56.704 --> 00:15:04.710]  After that meeting, however, you received two calls from the President, March 30th and April 11th, where the President talked about a cloud over his presidency.
[00:15:05.291 --> 00:15:11.496]  Has anything you've learned in the months since your February 14th meeting changed your understanding of the President's request?
[00:15:11.636 --> 00:15:15.819]  I guess it would be what he has said in public documents or public interviews?
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:16.700]  Correct.
[00:15:18.368 --> 00:15:25.592]  And again, what he had said before was, they were very clear, they said, he said, I hope that nothing is going to happen with Flynn.
[00:15:25.832 --> 00:15:28.193]  And that was a day after Flynn had been fired.
[00:15:28.773 --> 00:15:33.276]  And then a Democrat senator talking to him said, well, you really, you know, that's all he said.
[00:15:33.296 --> 00:15:38.838]  But the body language made it clear that he really wanted you to shut this down for political purposes.
[00:15:39.059 --> 00:15:39.459]  Oh, yes.
[00:15:39.579 --> 00:15:39.899]  Oh, yes.
[00:15:40.059 --> 00:15:41.620]  So he has contradicted himself.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:49.349]  And his sworn testimony that there was never any pressure put on him to try to shut down this investigation for political purposes.
[00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:54.876]  He said, yes, people have told us to shut down investigations because they weren't productive, but not for political purposes.
[00:15:55.557 --> 00:15:57.960]  And then he contradicts himself today.
[00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:01.002]  It's very interesting how this is going to go.
[00:16:01.022 --> 00:16:11.931]  He was walking a very thin line as he was doing that, but of course we've also learned that he was leaking information to the New York Times and he has shut down as false New York Times stories.
[00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:17.435]  So we've had very interesting developments here regarding the fake news from the New York Times.
[00:16:17.855 --> 00:16:18.556]  I'm David Knight here.
[00:16:18.596 --> 00:16:20.957]  This is our live coverage of the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.
[00:16:21.418 --> 00:16:23.700]  This is James Comey in his
[00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.322]  Do they have a duty to report it?
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.081]  That's a good question.
[00:16:44.181 --> 00:16:46.904]  I don't know that there's a legal duty to report it.
[00:16:46.984 --> 00:16:50.287]  They certainly have a cultural, ethical duty to report it.
[00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:51.628]  See something, say something.
[00:16:51.988 --> 00:16:54.491]  Why didn't you say something when you saw something at the time?
[00:16:54.671 --> 00:16:55.592]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:16:55.612 --> 00:16:56.332]  I've not thought of it before.
[00:16:56.413 --> 00:17:03.900]  I don't know where the legal... There's a statute that prohibits misprision of a felony, knowing of a felony, and taking steps to conceal it.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.961]  But this is a different question.
[00:17:04.981 --> 00:17:05.501]  He doesn't know the law.
[00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:06.242]  He's the FBI director.
[00:17:06.462 --> 00:17:11.146]  Let me be clear, I would expect any FBI agent who has recent information about a crime being committed to report it.
[00:17:11.367 --> 00:17:11.747]  Me too.
[00:17:12.067 --> 00:17:14.329]  But where you rest that obligation, I don't know.
[00:17:14.489 --> 00:17:14.950]  It exists.
[00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:27.561]  And let me ask you as a general proposition, if you're trying to make an investigation go away, is firing an FBI director a good way to make that happen?
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:36.383]  By that I mean... It doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but I'm obviously hopelessly biased, given that I was the one fired.
[00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.084]  I understand it's personal.
[00:17:40.605 --> 00:17:43.146]  No, given the nature of the FBI, I meant what I said.
[00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:49.909]  There's no indispensable people in the world, including at the FBI, that... There's lots of bad things about me not being at the FBI.
[00:17:49.949 --> 00:17:52.590]  Most of them are for me, but the work's gonna go on as before.
[00:17:52.870 --> 00:18:06.419]  So nothing that's happened that you've testified to here today has impeded the investigation of the FBI or Director Mueller's commitment to get to the bottom of this from the standpoint of the FBI and the Department of Justice.
[00:18:06.439 --> 00:18:06.999]  Would you agree with that?
[00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:07.459]  That's correct.
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.922]  Especially the appointment of former Director Mueller is a critical part of that equation.
[00:18:12.263 --> 00:18:14.904]  Let me take you back to the Clinton email investigation.
[00:18:15.745 --> 00:18:18.667]  I think you've been cast as a hero or a villain.
[00:18:20.848 --> 00:18:31.297]  Depending on whose political ox is being gored at many different times during the course of the Clinton email investigation, even now perhaps.
[00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:35.260]  But you clearly were troubled by
[00:18:36.261 --> 00:18:43.162]  The conduct of the sitting Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, when it came to the Clinton email investigation.
[00:18:43.202 --> 00:18:50.684]  You mentioned the characterization that you'd been asked to accept that this was a matter and not a criminal investigation, which you said it was.
[00:18:51.204 --> 00:19:04.306]  There was the matter of President Clinton's meeting on the tarmac with the sitting Attorney General at a time when his wife was a subject to a criminal investigation, and you suggested that perhaps there are other
[00:19:05.146 --> 00:19:08.993]  In just a couple of days before she's going to be faced with a deposition by the FBI.
[00:19:18.775 --> 00:19:23.376]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got live, commercial-free feeds at Infowars.com for our radio stations.
[00:19:23.396 --> 00:19:27.077]  We're going to break, and we will come back with more of the live feed.
[00:19:27.577 --> 00:19:39.041]  And we'll also start playing clips that we have of him clearly waffling and perjuring himself in different congressional testimonies versus what he says was in the memo that he leaked to the press.
[00:19:39.361 --> 00:19:43.782]  That's right, he leaked basically a lie
[00:19:44.778 --> 00:19:46.783]  According to his testimony now, to the press.
[00:19:47.044 --> 00:19:49.912]  So he's leaking information that's also lies.
[00:19:50.433 --> 00:19:52.538]  A double, double helping.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.361]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[00:19:56.421 --> 00:19:57.482]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:19:57.742 --> 00:19:58.663]  Why is this so good?
[00:19:58.963 --> 00:20:04.186]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:17.834]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:20:17.894 --> 00:20:19.275]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:20:20.055 --> 00:20:21.637]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[00:20:21.697 --> 00:20:24.180]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.542]  These are all parasites.
[00:20:25.582 --> 00:20:26.683]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:20:26.703 --> 00:20:27.744]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:20:28.045 --> 00:20:32.390]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.774]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:20:35.814 --> 00:20:38.915]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:20:38.935 --> 00:20:39.956]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:20:39.996 --> 00:20:41.877]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:41.937 --> 00:20:42.957]  And folks, you can't lose.
[00:20:42.977 --> 00:20:45.058]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:48.700]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.861]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:53.202]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[00:20:55.771 --> 00:20:56.933]  Trillions more in the stock market.
[00:20:57.253 --> 00:20:58.354]  Hundreds of billions in jobs.
[00:20:58.575 --> 00:20:59.476]  Restoring the country.
[00:20:59.836 --> 00:21:01.058]  Protecting police getting killed.
[00:21:01.298 --> 00:21:02.220]  Taking care of veterans.
[00:21:03.001 --> 00:21:03.561]  You want that?
[00:21:03.742 --> 00:21:04.102]  I'm here.
[00:21:04.302 --> 00:21:05.524]  You want to go with the same scum?
[00:21:05.544 --> 00:21:05.984]  Go with them.
[00:21:06.065 --> 00:21:06.365]  Fine.
[00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:07.807]  Destroy me if you want to.
[00:21:08.147 --> 00:21:10.290]  I'm standing on this and that's the end of it.
[00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.251]  And they don't know what to do.
[00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:13.291]  Well, exactly.
[00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:22.998]  And the other part of this, the never-Trumpers, and we have to really focus on the never-Trumpers, and the establishment Republicans, the previous, the Ryans, the McCains.
[00:21:23.018 --> 00:21:23.859]  They're the fifth column.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.180]  Exactly.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:25.941]  And you know something?
[00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:32.205]  I'm so tired of these snot-nosed, mealy-mouthed, spineless Republican conservatives.
[00:21:32.365 --> 00:21:32.706]  Exactly.
[00:21:33.046 --> 00:21:41.978]  Give it to somebody to kill TPPs, secure the border, put conservatives on, he's doing it all, and they sit around and bitch where the strongman stumbled when they're not in the arena.
[00:21:42.158 --> 00:21:45.182]  And that's why I back Trump when he's under attack more than ever.
[00:21:45.402 --> 00:21:47.625]  And I expect that if I'm going down.
[00:21:48.579 --> 00:21:48.959]  Exactly.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.682]  And if we are in a war, if we truly believe what we're saying that we're in a war, then let's act like it.
[00:21:56.583 --> 00:21:57.083]  Let's do it.
[00:21:58.184 --> 00:21:58.844]  Legally, of course.
[00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:03.026]  You know, through the legal systems and through... We need to have that attitude because they're all saying it's a war.
[00:22:03.046 --> 00:22:04.307]  In fact, let's start playing some clips.
[00:22:05.067 --> 00:22:14.453]  This president has done in his first hundred plus days, even before he came into office, is pick fights with the intelligence community and now the law enforcement community.
[00:22:14.954 --> 00:22:24.620]  Particularly the way, never mind that he fired James Comey, but the way in which he did it, not giving him the respect of actually telling him in person or at least not having him find out from cable news.
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.321]  I mean, Dana Bash...
[00:22:27.566 --> 00:22:29.369]  Now Trump's anti-police.
[00:22:30.291 --> 00:22:38.805]  This is the party that's given $500 million, just from Soros alone, to Black Lives Matter and other liberal groups like the Red Brigades and people.
[00:22:39.778 --> 00:22:42.901]  That are literally saying kill cops and random white people.
[00:22:42.921 --> 00:22:44.522]  It's not even blacks doing it, mainly.
[00:22:44.543 --> 00:22:46.885]  It's a bunch of white socialists and communists.
[00:22:47.325 --> 00:22:49.487]  They're the ones running around saying kill everybody.
[00:22:50.248 --> 00:22:52.510]  They're the ones that want the UN to run local police.
[00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.792]  And then they say Trump's the enemy of police.
[00:22:55.212 --> 00:22:59.476]  Everything that comes out of their fat mouths is a bona fide, certified lie.
[00:22:59.757 --> 00:23:00.878]  Now let's go to Chuckie Schumer.
[00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:06.431]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:23:07.011 --> 00:23:12.634]  So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[00:23:12.674 --> 00:23:15.415]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were motivated?
[00:23:15.435 --> 00:23:22.078]  I don't know, but from what I am told, they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them.
[00:23:22.878 --> 00:23:23.939]  He's doing the right thing.
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.681]  Let the chips fall where they may.
[00:23:25.701 --> 00:23:26.942]  That's why he said these tweets.
[00:23:27.483 --> 00:23:28.504]  I'm going to go all the way.
[00:23:28.644 --> 00:23:29.585]  I'm going to double down.
[00:23:29.705 --> 00:23:30.566]  I'm going to be strong.
[00:23:30.666 --> 00:23:31.687]  I need you to be strong.
[00:23:32.047 --> 00:23:33.048]  I'm going to do the right thing.
[00:23:33.148 --> 00:23:34.149]  I'm not going to stop.
[00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.571]  That's called commitment.
[00:23:36.771 --> 00:23:42.136]  And these cowards that all get around the little coward groups, Doug, they don't know what it's like to commit to something.
[00:23:42.476 --> 00:23:44.558]  They think they go with whatever the easiest road is.
[00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:46.901]  That creates North Korea or Venezuela.
[00:23:47.581 --> 00:23:50.026]  Stuff that Trump's doing created America!
[00:23:50.046 --> 00:23:50.768]  Get used to it!
[00:23:51.028 --> 00:23:53.052]  Donald Trump is an American!
[00:23:56.784 --> 00:23:57.645]  Alex Jones here.
[00:23:57.865 --> 00:24:01.667]  We are back live with my intrepid crew and our great affiliates across the country.
[00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:13.354]  David Knight is streaming on the internet and to some stations and folks that are picking up our live coverage and live feed of the Comey hearings with limited analysis by David Knight.
[00:24:13.374 --> 00:24:15.155]  He'll be joining us a little bit later in the broadcast.
[00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:18.657]  Those feeds are on Infowars.com right now.
[00:24:18.697 --> 00:24:24.621]  You can see David Knight over there giving live analysis of the hearings via the C-SPAN feed.
[00:24:25.521 --> 00:24:28.623]  If you want that live coverage, you go to InfoWars.com.
[00:24:28.703 --> 00:24:33.025]  I'll be taking excerpts throughout this hour and some of the live feed.
[00:24:34.085 --> 00:24:34.846]  My head is spinning.
[00:24:34.926 --> 00:24:44.090]  I have never been running around like a chicken with my head cut off like I've been the last few hours because of the clips we're about to start playing now and then ongoing as the hearing continues.
[00:24:45.191 --> 00:24:46.812]  This is beyond a nothing burger.
[00:24:49.193 --> 00:24:52.855]  This is a treason burger, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:53.535 --> 00:24:55.056]  Comey admits he leaked
[00:24:56.018 --> 00:25:03.542]  The memo to the New York Times, which they did admit got the story wrong.
[00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:08.225]  Oh, so they used a memo, misrepresented what was in it to hurt the president.
[00:25:08.245 --> 00:25:09.486]  That's what I told you day one.
[00:25:10.366 --> 00:25:12.247]  Then he wouldn't give the memo to Congress.
[00:25:13.428 --> 00:25:16.750]  So he admits he gave this memo to a friend in the press.
[00:25:21.004 --> 00:25:25.848]  And now CNN has had to admit fake news about Comey testimony and of course issued a retraction.
[00:25:25.868 --> 00:25:26.829]  CNN issues correction.
[00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.593]  Headline changes following testimony.
[00:25:31.694 --> 00:25:32.915]  Sorry for the fake news.
[00:25:33.055 --> 00:25:35.918]  I mean this is just mind-blowing.
[00:25:36.778 --> 00:25:37.940]  But my head's spinning right now.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.041]  This is so many things.
[00:25:40.422 --> 00:25:42.484]  This is Comey admitting he put out the memo.
[00:25:44.127 --> 00:25:47.910]  Comey then admits that the New York Times got the story completely wrong from the memo.
[00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:57.496]  So he commits a crime with a memo that he leaks to the press that they then misrepresent, which we know it was meant to do.
[00:25:57.976 --> 00:26:08.423]  Because that memo, the way the New York Times reported it, and the way the Washington Post reported it, completely and totally contradicted his testimony on May 3rd, two months later.
[00:26:09.364 --> 00:26:11.825]  So now he's got to come back and clean all this up.
[00:26:12.025 --> 00:26:12.726]  But it gets worse.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:29.657]  He then tells multiple senators that no one tried to influence him on Russia, but through his surrogates that he's linked to, he said that they did try to influence Russia, on the Russia.
[00:26:30.278 --> 00:26:34.523]  All Comey now says he felt influenced on was leave Flynn alone, he's a good guy.
[00:26:35.618 --> 00:26:37.579]  I hope you can see it through to not go after him.
[00:26:37.739 --> 00:26:38.680]  That's not ordering him.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.141]  So that's a lie too.
[00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:45.924]  All of this is a bunch of lawyers trying to spin and confuse and manipulate the public.
[00:26:45.944 --> 00:26:46.944]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:26:47.185 --> 00:26:49.186]  The takeaway is, none of it's real.
[00:26:49.766 --> 00:26:51.807]  It's all fake, from pillar to post.
[00:26:52.547 --> 00:26:58.511]  Then they've got other clips dealing with the Russia dossier, Pissgate, all of it, admitting that's all fake now.
[00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:13.692]  But remember BuzzFeed and all the rest of them and Daily Beast coming out saying I had edited a tape of Comey when he's asked if anybody's tried to influence him, the Attorney General or anybody, he says no, no one has.
[00:27:13.932 --> 00:27:16.655]  That means no one has because it'd be a pretty big deal.
[00:27:16.876 --> 00:27:18.798]  They then spun it that that didn't mean the President.
[00:27:19.935 --> 00:27:25.080]  But then today, Senator Burr is talking to him and he says specifically the President didn't.
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:29.063]  So we're real, BuzzFeed and the Daily Beast, you're fake.
[00:27:29.443 --> 00:27:31.305]  And CNN has to admit they're fake.
[00:27:31.765 --> 00:27:37.090]  We were right again, specifically, on target, exactly as it was.
[00:27:37.871 --> 00:27:43.576]  There was a memo that he never filed with the Justice Department like he's supposed to do.
[00:27:45.131 --> 00:27:46.572]  That he then gave to the media.
[00:27:46.632 --> 00:27:47.712]  That's a whole other crime.
[00:27:48.092 --> 00:27:50.734]  Then the media claimed it was national security information.
[00:27:50.774 --> 00:27:53.275]  Well, a memo like that would be, so that's another crime.
[00:27:53.595 --> 00:28:01.479]  Then the media misrepresents what it is, and Comey lets that go on for over a month and a half before he comes out and says that it was misrepresented.
[00:28:01.959 --> 00:28:03.079]  On and on and on.
[00:28:03.199 --> 00:28:06.681]  A tissue, a spectrum, an entire world of lies.
[00:28:09.202 --> 00:28:11.863]  We're going to come back in the next long segment and go to all these clips.
[00:28:13.599 --> 00:28:14.139]  On Flynn.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:15.720]  Senator Burr.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:16.801]  Flashback.
[00:28:16.881 --> 00:28:17.881]  Would have been a big deal.
[00:28:18.061 --> 00:28:19.282]  Nobody tried to influence him.
[00:28:19.522 --> 00:28:22.063]  Loretta Lynch did try to influence him on the email.
[00:28:22.443 --> 00:28:25.004]  That's a big deal, because then he did kill the investigation.
[00:28:25.565 --> 00:28:26.065]  Wow.
[00:28:26.625 --> 00:28:27.125]  Wow.
[00:28:27.686 --> 00:28:29.707]  New York Times, Russia collusion story.
[00:28:30.107 --> 00:28:31.688]  Wrong in the main.
[00:28:33.528 --> 00:28:38.551]  That's why they're now shifting gears to, oh, it's a criminal investigation in case somebody who was innocent
[00:28:39.727 --> 00:28:42.608]  Tried to not answer questions right and claim they lied to the FBI.
[00:28:42.628 --> 00:28:43.709]  That's how it always goes.
[00:28:45.189 --> 00:28:45.690]  Incredible.
[00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:51.612]  Meanwhile, Hillary and her people get 30 plus million from the Russians, shell out our uranium, meet secretly with Putin.
[00:28:53.233 --> 00:28:56.935]  I mean, Megyn Kelly's running around doing interviews with Putin.
[00:28:58.235 --> 00:28:59.956]  She's got more connection to Putin than
[00:29:02.352 --> 00:29:05.136]  General Flynn does, just being at the same banquet hall with him.
[00:29:05.856 --> 00:29:06.637]  That's what Putin said to her.
[00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:08.320]  He said, you should be arrested.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:14.227]  If Flynn's been fired for going to a public event that I was at, then you should be arrested.
[00:29:15.108 --> 00:29:17.351]  And people say, she got destroyed in that interview.
[00:29:17.591 --> 00:29:20.355]  She got destroyed because she's been given an impossible job.
[00:29:21.667 --> 00:29:24.991]  Megyn Kelly's probably the hardest interview I've ever done.
[00:29:25.032 --> 00:29:26.253]  She's a very sharp lawyer.
[00:29:27.234 --> 00:29:29.598]  She got the better of me in the interview she did the other night.
[00:29:29.658 --> 00:29:30.459]  That's why I'm mad.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:36.307]  Because it was just a lawyer asking the same questions five, six times to twist it all into knots on purpose.
[00:29:37.398 --> 00:29:43.226]  But see, he's got an impossible job to sell and so does the media on Russia collusion because it didn't happen.
[00:29:43.246 --> 00:29:44.107]  We're on the march.
[00:29:44.608 --> 00:29:46.210]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:46.791 --> 00:29:47.892]  Bombshell clips.
[00:29:47.932 --> 00:29:48.873]  Bombshell clips.

[00:31:08.723 --> 00:31:17.008]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.

[00:31:26.313 --> 00:31:32.056]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:31:32.396 --> 00:31:32.857]  It works.
[00:31:33.137 --> 00:31:41.466]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.

[00:33:03.171 --> 00:33:09.148]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure, you're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.475 --> 00:33:27.127]  You're listening to live coverage of the historic former FBI Director James Comey hearings in Congress that has blown up in their face.
[00:33:27.368 --> 00:33:32.477]  MSM is in damage control mode right now going, oh Comey leaked.
[00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.051]  To the press, because it was the right thing to do.
[00:33:35.071 --> 00:33:39.575]  Oh, and then we took the information and used the wall of secrecy to lie about what was in the memo.
[00:33:39.835 --> 00:33:41.396]  He's now said the media got it wrong.
[00:33:42.057 --> 00:33:44.058]  And he said, oh, they did try to influence me.
[00:33:44.298 --> 00:33:47.080]  Oh, but they didn't try to influence me in congressional hearings.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.121]  We have all these clips.
[00:33:48.622 --> 00:33:50.323]  This is unbelievable.
[00:33:50.423 --> 00:33:52.384]  Oh, and Loretta Lynch tried to influence me.
[00:33:52.665 --> 00:33:53.766]  And guess what she did?
[00:33:54.106 --> 00:33:56.828]  You dropped the investigation into the email servers.
[00:33:58.089 --> 00:33:59.390]  This is all coming up.
[00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.072]  I've got seven of these clips I'm going to play in just a moment.
[00:34:03.848 --> 00:34:10.173]  But I want to go to some of David Knight's live coverage of one of the biggest anti-American globalist piece of garbage is out there.
[00:34:10.674 --> 00:34:20.222]  John McCain of the Keating Five, anti-gun, pro-open borders, funding the radical jihadis, the Arab Spring, working with the EU to open the borders up to bring in refugees.
[00:34:20.522 --> 00:34:23.885]  I mean, John McCain is about as conservative as Mao Zedong.
[00:34:24.225 --> 00:34:25.166]  Let's go to John McCain.
[00:34:27.068 --> 00:34:31.892]  You just made it clear in what you said this is a quote big deal unquote.
[00:34:34.492 --> 00:34:36.813]  I think it's hard to reconcile.
[00:34:37.253 --> 00:34:42.357]  In one case, you reach a complete conclusion, and on the other side, you have not.
[00:34:44.498 --> 00:34:51.742]  In fact, obviously, there's a lot more there, as we know, as you called it, a quote, big deal.
[00:34:52.102 --> 00:34:53.303]  She's one of the candidates.
[00:34:53.643 --> 00:34:57.466]  But in her case, you say, there will be no charges, and in the case
[00:34:59.688 --> 00:35:02.771]  The investigation continues.
[00:35:03.411 --> 00:35:10.878]  What has been brought out in this hearing is more and more emphasis on the Russian engagement and involvement in this campaign.
[00:35:12.588 --> 00:35:15.089]  How serious do you think this was?
[00:35:15.209 --> 00:35:19.151]  Comey just came out 20 minutes ago and said that there wasn't evidence of it.
[00:35:19.171 --> 00:35:20.091]  Let me be clear.
[00:35:21.212 --> 00:35:28.795]  We have not announced, and there was no predication to announce, an investigation of whether the Russians may have coordinated with Secretary Clinton's campaign.
[00:35:30.036 --> 00:35:32.977]  No, but they may not have been involved with their campaign.
[00:35:33.017 --> 00:35:36.318]  They were involved with the entire presidential campaign, obviously.
[00:35:36.418 --> 00:35:37.899]  Oh, obviously, sir.
[00:35:38.119 --> 00:35:39.020]  And that is an investigation.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:39.680]  They were on everything.
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:44.445]  That began last summer, and so far as I'm aware, it continues.
[00:35:45.266 --> 00:35:51.713]  When is somebody going to investigate Comey's connection to Christopher Steele, who came up with the dirty dossier?
[00:35:51.773 --> 00:35:56.298]  When are they going to investigate the connections between Steele and the Clinton campaign?
[00:35:56.618 --> 00:35:57.619]  As Grassley said...
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:08.289]  This raises questions as to whether or not the FBI is independent from politics, and whether or not the Obama administration used law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends.
[00:36:08.669 --> 00:36:12.132]  This is what the Senate Intelligence Committee should be investigating.
[00:36:12.152 --> 00:36:20.139]  The Senate Intelligence Committee should be concerned about whether or not our own intelligence agencies were used for political purposes.
[00:36:21.932 --> 00:36:26.634]  Again, David Knight is giving you live coverage on the feeds at InfoWars.com.
[00:36:27.914 --> 00:36:32.655]  You can go to InfoWars.com and find those feeds of his live coverage.
[00:36:33.256 --> 00:36:35.296]  That's David Knight with InfoWars.com.
[00:36:36.016 --> 00:36:40.358]  He is running a live feed of the hearings and giving limited commentary.
[00:36:41.698 --> 00:36:47.660]  And unfortunately, the way we have the feeds going today, I can't talk over him, he can't talk over me, so we have to cut each other off when one of the other people comes up.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.061]  Let's go to a few more minutes of this.
[00:36:49.081 --> 00:36:50.081]  I'm going to come back with our clips.
[00:36:50.799 --> 00:36:52.040]  Yeah, I get that, Senator.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:37:09.214]  Honestly, I'll tell you what, this is speculation, but what I concluded at the time is in his memory he was searching back to our encounter at the dinner and was preparing himself to say, I offered loyalty to you, you promised loyalty to me, and all of a sudden his memory showed him that did not happen, and I think he pulled up short.
[00:37:09.314 --> 00:37:12.737]  That's just a guess, but I've had a lot of conversations with humans over the years.
[00:37:12.757 --> 00:37:19.362]  Except that you testified under oath that you were never pressured to stop an investigation for political purposes.
[00:37:20.163 --> 00:37:23.327]  He keeps going back and forth, back and forth under oath.
[00:37:23.527 --> 00:37:25.429]  This guy needs to be tried for perjury.
[00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:30.415]  You want to talk about how he's trying to entrap people in the Trump administration with process crimes?
[00:37:30.536 --> 00:37:33.299]  He has done this multiple times today.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.423]  That's a subject for... Committed perjury.
[00:37:36.443 --> 00:37:37.204]  ...investigation.
[00:37:37.264 --> 00:37:39.006]  It's not something I can comment on sitting here.
[00:37:42.156 --> 00:37:46.639]  But you reached that conclusion as far as Secretary Clinton was concerned.
[00:37:47.039 --> 00:37:51.882]  But you're not reaching a conclusion as far as this administration is concerned.
[00:37:53.243 --> 00:37:59.367]  Are you aware of anything that would lead you to believe that information exists that could
[00:38:02.768 --> 00:38:06.471]  Coerce members of the administration or blackmail the administration?
[00:38:33.729 --> 00:38:34.470]  Another 20 minutes.
[00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:44.371]  Again, you're listening to live coverage.
[00:38:44.431 --> 00:38:46.032]  I'm David Knight from Infowars.com.
[00:38:46.052 --> 00:38:53.515]  This is live coverage of the Senate Intelligence Committee talking to James Comey, trying to find something to come after Donald Trump for.
[00:38:53.535 --> 00:39:04.659]  And yet, we have had James Comey, multiple times now, state and also imply, sometimes directly stated, that he was politically pressured to stop the investigation.
[00:39:05.529 --> 00:39:05.589]  And
[00:39:24.275 --> 00:39:26.116]  So he has committed perjury.
[00:39:26.156 --> 00:39:29.677]  He has also talked about how he leaked information to the New York Times.
[00:39:30.037 --> 00:39:34.078]  He has shut down New York Times articles as fake news.
[00:39:34.098 --> 00:39:35.979]  It's been an interesting couple hearings here.
[00:39:36.019 --> 00:39:38.800]  Let's hear what is going to be coming up next from the chair.
[00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:39.300]  Senator Burr.
[00:39:40.684 --> 00:39:50.727]  We're grateful to them with the level of cooperation that they have shown us, with the trust we've built between both organizations, the Congress and the Bureau.
[00:39:52.288 --> 00:39:56.409]  We couldn't do our job if it wasn't for their willingness to work with us.
[00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:16.782]  He will not go to where the Senate Intelligence Committee needs to go, and that is oversight and investigation of multiple violations of the law by the FBI, by the NSA, the involvement, the open involvement by current and past officials of the intelligence services in our politics.
[00:40:16.902 --> 00:40:25.548]  The politicization of these intelligence agencies is something that the Senate Intelligence Committee should be investigating, and instead they aren't.
[00:40:26.168 --> 00:40:32.153]  Instead they're doing the same thing that Hillary Clinton did back with the DNC as that was beginning.
[00:40:32.773 --> 00:40:39.999]  Redirecting everybody away from her criminal actions and to this boogeyman of the Russians, the Red Herring.
[00:40:40.039 --> 00:40:40.999]  They're doing the same thing.
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:46.063]  The real story here is what did the FBI, the NSA, the CIA do?
[00:40:46.584 --> 00:40:53.289]  Directly violating laws and we just had the FISA court declassify a statement telling us that they're violating the law.
[00:40:54.389 --> 00:40:55.569]  They're raising the flag.
[00:40:55.969 --> 00:41:01.290]  These people are trying to bury that and misdirect it towards Trump, towards the Russians.
[00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:08.232]  When the reality is, the story here, as Rand Paul has said, is the use of the intelligence community for political ends.
[00:41:08.392 --> 00:41:10.932]  Grassley has said that as well in a letter to Comey.
[00:41:11.332 --> 00:41:12.733]  That's what needs to be investigated.
[00:41:12.913 --> 00:41:14.573]  That's what's not being talked about.
[00:41:14.973 --> 00:41:17.973]  That's what people like Richard Burr are covering up.
[00:41:18.294 --> 00:41:20.554]  And that's his responsibility to investigate.
[00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:26.255]  For your appearance, and there clearly still remain a number of questions.
[00:41:26.475 --> 00:41:35.445]  And the one thing I want to commit to you, and more importantly, I think, Chairman, I want to commit to all those who are still potentially watching and following.
[00:41:36.447 --> 00:41:39.410]  There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and we're going to get to the bottom of this.
[00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:40.711]  We're going to get the facts out.
[00:41:41.212 --> 00:41:42.693]  The American people deserve to know.
[00:41:44.134 --> 00:41:51.798]  There's the questions around implications of Trump officials and the Russians, but there's also the macro issue of what the Russians did and continue to do.
[00:41:52.298 --> 00:41:55.640]  And I think it is very important that all Americans realize that threat is real.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.580]  It is continuous.
[00:41:58.081 --> 00:41:59.421]  It is not just towards our nation.
[00:41:59.801 --> 00:42:03.163]  It is all towards all Western democracies, and we have to come to a solution set.
[00:42:03.463 --> 00:42:04.123]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[00:42:04.343 --> 00:42:06.665]  Director Comey, thank you once again on behalf of the committee.
[00:42:06.705 --> 00:42:07.485]  This hearing is adjourned.
[00:42:16.625 --> 00:42:19.447]  And there you can see that they are recessing.
[00:42:20.328 --> 00:42:29.614]  They've also talked about going into a private hearing on intelligence, so we'll continue to watch this as it unfolds.
[00:42:29.654 --> 00:42:31.475]  We're going to go back to David Nunn a little bit later.
[00:42:31.795 --> 00:42:36.819]  He's got the live feed coverage of what he's doing, but they are breaking up live right now.
[00:42:36.859 --> 00:42:40.061]  We'll have more information for you here in just a few minutes.
[00:42:40.621 --> 00:42:42.162]  They're with the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[00:42:42.402 --> 00:42:42.963]  Now let's stop.
[00:42:44.130 --> 00:43:08.147]  The point David Knight was making, as we were taking that live feed with his live analysis at the InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas, picking up the feed from DC, if you're tuning in and wondering what you're hearing, is that it's now in the news, it's confirmed, Obama was using the NSA in the 2016 election to spy on Trump and his opponents to try to basically derail the situation.
[00:43:10.063 --> 00:43:12.625]  And to basically try to win it for Hillary.
[00:43:13.345 --> 00:43:13.825]  We know that.
[00:43:14.286 --> 00:43:29.816]  That other elements of our intelligence agencies and people inside the DNC began to leak information to try to counter that and to try to stop that because they understood that the deep state was trying to keep a nationalist populist candidate from coming to power.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:32.123]  That's exactly what they did.
[00:43:32.263 --> 00:43:33.445]  They knew what they were doing.
[00:43:34.046 --> 00:43:36.912]  And so a major counterbalance came in to counter it.
[00:43:37.312 --> 00:43:37.994]  And that's what's happened.
[00:43:38.435 --> 00:43:40.799]  But I told you that the Comey memo was just...
[00:43:41.764 --> 00:44:02.038]  A excuse for them to put out disinformation and when the memo came out it wouldn't say what they'd said because Comey is a snake and he's not going to put in a memo that the president tried to, you know, basically commit crimes and tell him what to do on a criminal investigation with Russia and then go testify to Congress that that was the case.
[00:44:03.719 --> 00:44:09.703]  Except if he was keeping the memo back illegally and not filing it with the Justice Department so he could use it in case he wanted to.
[00:44:11.886 --> 00:44:17.951]  But then he now comes out and testifies that that's not the case and that the New York Times and others got it wrong what was in the memo.
[00:44:18.331 --> 00:44:20.152]  So let's go ahead and go through some of the clips.
[00:44:20.192 --> 00:44:24.096]  Here is Marco Rubio talking about General Flynn today.
[00:44:24.636 --> 00:44:29.460]  And was Trump trying to influence the Russia investigation or influence things on Flynn?
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.460]  Let's go to that clip.
[00:44:31.701 --> 00:44:39.628]  Director Comey, the meeting in the Oval Office where he made the request about Mike Flynn, was that the only time he asked you to hopefully let it go?
[00:44:40.487 --> 00:44:40.707]  Yes.
[00:44:41.408 --> 00:44:50.393]  And in that meeting, as you understood it, he was asking not about the general Russia investigation, he was asking very specifically about the jeopardy that Flynn was in himself.
[00:44:50.813 --> 00:44:51.854]  That's how I understood it, yes sir.
[00:44:52.094 --> 00:45:00.879]  And as you perceived it, while it was a request that he hoped you did away with it, you perceived it as an order, given his position, the setting, and the like, and some of the circumstances.
[00:45:01.739 --> 00:45:01.980]  Yes.
[00:45:02.881 --> 00:45:06.427]  At the time, did you say anything to the President about that is not an appropriate request?
[00:45:06.487 --> 00:45:10.013]  Or did you tell the White House Counsel that is not an appropriate request?
[00:45:10.134 --> 00:45:13.299]  Someone needs to go tell the President that he can't do these things?
[00:45:13.439 --> 00:45:13.980]  I didn't, no.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:14.801]  Okay, why?
[00:45:16.189 --> 00:45:16.529]  I don't know.
[00:45:16.949 --> 00:45:23.212]  I think the circumstances were such that I was stunned and didn't have the presence of mind.
[00:45:23.552 --> 00:45:27.794]  And I don't want to make you sound like I'm Captain Courageous.
[00:45:27.874 --> 00:45:32.035]  I don't know whether even if I had the presence of mind, I would have said to the President, Sir, that's wrong.
[00:45:32.155 --> 00:45:33.116]  I don't know whether I would have.
[00:45:33.376 --> 00:45:36.177]  But in the moment, it didn't come to my mind.
[00:45:36.217 --> 00:45:38.338]  What came to my mind is, be careful what you say.
[00:45:39.158 --> 00:45:41.159]  And so I said, I agree, Flynn is a good guy.
[00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:50.543]  So if the Attorney General or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?
[00:45:50.563 --> 00:45:52.886]  In theory, yes.
[00:45:54.469 --> 00:45:55.110]  Has it happened?
[00:45:56.263 --> 00:46:03.489]  Not in my experience, because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something without an appropriate purpose.
[00:46:03.949 --> 00:46:09.554]  I mean, oftentimes they give us opinions that we don't see a case there, and so you ought to stop investing resources in it.
[00:46:10.015 --> 00:46:13.778]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason.
[00:46:14.158 --> 00:46:15.299]  That would be a very big deal.
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:17.241]  It's not happened in my experience.
[00:46:17.261 --> 00:46:20.003]  Now we're going to play that clip again.
[00:46:20.223 --> 00:46:23.426]  The first part was Marco Rubio, today.
[00:46:27.472 --> 00:46:31.995]  And we're hearing that he did feel like he was being influenced and being ordered around.
[00:46:32.735 --> 00:46:43.642]  And then we've got the clip from May 3rd, two months after the supposed memo in February with the President, where he did try to influence him, that was leaked to the press, saying that he didn't feel like anybody tried to influence him.
[00:46:43.802 --> 00:46:46.584]  But then the media spun that and said, oh, Jones, fake news again.
[00:46:46.604 --> 00:46:49.285]  Clearly they're asking about the Attorney General of the Justice Department.
[00:46:49.585 --> 00:46:50.946]  No, he's asked about that.
[00:46:51.306 --> 00:46:54.348]  And then he comes out and he says, nobody.
[00:46:54.608 --> 00:46:55.229]  It'd be a big deal.
[00:46:56.294 --> 00:46:57.615]  So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[00:46:58.035 --> 00:46:59.976]  Mainstream media saying I lied or edited the clip.
[00:47:00.356 --> 00:47:03.338]  But let's play a clip from today that really puts that to bed.
[00:47:03.738 --> 00:47:11.902]  Here's Senator Burr asking specifically if he was told to shut down the Russia investigation or influence.
[00:47:11.942 --> 00:47:20.146]  This is today, Daily Beast, today, BuzzFeed, you liars, you fake news garbage sellers that lie to you.
[00:47:20.407 --> 00:47:24.629]  I mean, The Huffington Post had the headline today that the top story is Marco Rubio's hair.
[00:47:25.796 --> 00:47:38.965]  This isn't funny that we've got the deep state and both political parties trying to destroy President Trump, trying to cut our taxes and restore our republic, claiming he works for foreign powers with no evidence in a dangerous witch hunt, when they're the ones that sold us out to globalists.
[00:47:40.226 --> 00:47:43.808]  Yeah, Marco Rubio hair nabs a starring role during Comey testimony.
[00:47:44.068 --> 00:47:46.210]  That's one of the top stories on the Huffington Post.
[00:47:47.711 --> 00:47:50.352]  Because they've got these readers that think everything's funny.
[00:47:50.573 --> 00:47:53.154]  I was on the Daily Beast the other day and I was also on the BuzzFeed.
[00:47:53.354 --> 00:47:55.436]  They had whole articles about how to eat boogers.
[00:47:57.642 --> 00:48:06.932]  That's what the grown intellectual left reads all day because they keep them in this arrested development mode where they think this is all funny watching the whole world gang up on our president.
[00:48:07.192 --> 00:48:14.519]  Where they think it's funny to watch gays getting thrown off buildings by jihadis that are then brought into our country by the liberals and women put it on hijabs.
[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.762]  You people are mentally ill and crazy.
[00:48:18.237 --> 00:48:19.017]  That's equilibrium.
[00:48:19.138 --> 00:48:25.722]  You're giving a total country, everything free, a bunch of spoiled brats, so you want to burn the house down over our dead body scumbags.
[00:48:25.962 --> 00:48:35.828]  Here's Senator Burr, today, confirming what Comey said on May 3rd, that nobody, including the President, tried to make him shut down the Russia investigation.
[00:48:36.128 --> 00:48:39.290]  Exactly what Donald Trump said!
[00:48:42.779 --> 00:48:51.407]  Did the president at any time ask you to stop the FBI investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 US elections?
[00:48:51.627 --> 00:48:52.728]  Not to my understanding, no.
[00:48:53.529 --> 00:49:01.436]  Did any individual working for this administration, including the Justice Department, ask you to stop the Russian investigation?
[00:49:01.796 --> 00:49:01.956]  No.
[00:49:04.138 --> 00:49:09.623]  Director, when the president requested that you, and I quote, let Flynn go,
[00:49:13.675 --> 00:49:21.399]  General Flynn had an unreported contact with the Russians, which is an offense.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:29.564]  And if press accounts are right, there might have been discrepancies between facts and his FBI testimony.
[00:49:31.553 --> 00:49:36.519]  And your estimation was General Flynn at that time in serious legal jeopardy.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:48.372]  And in addition to that, do you sense that the president was trying to obstruct justice or just seek for a way for Mike Flynn to save face given he had already been fired?
[00:49:49.813 --> 00:49:52.154]  General Flynn at that point in time was in legal jeopardy.
[00:49:52.734 --> 00:50:00.157]  There was an open FBI criminal investigation of his statements in connection with the Russian contacts and the contacts themselves.
[00:50:00.897 --> 00:50:02.678]  And so that was my assessment at the time.
[00:50:03.438 --> 00:50:07.519]  I don't think it's for me to say whether the conversation I had with the president was an effort to obstruct.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:17.623]  I took it as a very disturbing thing, very concerning, but that's a conclusion I'm sure the special counsel will work towards to try and understand what the intention was there and whether that's an offense.
[00:50:19.045 --> 00:50:21.708]  But she didn't give it to the Justice Department, even though it was so disturbing.
[00:50:22.989 --> 00:50:26.373]  That General Flynn was at a dinner that Putin was at publicly at a TV gala.
[00:50:26.493 --> 00:50:27.114]  Oh my gosh.
[00:50:27.774 --> 00:50:28.715]  Arrest Megyn Kelly then.
[00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:31.899]  And I'm not saying arrest Megyn Kelly before they run those headlines.
[00:50:33.581 --> 00:50:35.922]  Wow, that is mind-blowing right there.
[00:50:36.242 --> 00:50:39.524]  But of course, what does the so-called memo say?
[00:50:40.024 --> 00:50:42.045]  Well, I hope you can see it your way to leave him alone.
[00:50:42.065 --> 00:50:42.666]  He's a good guy.
[00:50:43.026 --> 00:50:44.747]  What do you think prosecutors talk about all day?
[00:50:45.427 --> 00:50:47.288]  But the president, he's not allowed to talk like that.
[00:50:47.648 --> 00:50:51.230]  Clearly, clearly, this is all an attack on the president and made up.
[00:50:55.202 --> 00:50:56.863]  Here's something you won't hear on the fake news.
[00:50:57.063 --> 00:51:02.826]  According to the Daily Caller, Trump's approval rating is actually higher than Bill Clinton's was at the same point in his presidency.
[00:51:02.886 --> 00:51:12.030]  That's despite all the negative media attention, the wild goose hunt over bogus charges of Russia's involvement in the election, and the unending chorus of anti-Trump talking heads on network news.
[00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:17.212]  Even the liberal rag Newsweek magazine had to admit Trump's approval rating was better than Bill Clinton's at 160 days in.
[00:51:18.433 --> 00:51:25.839]  While Trump's approval rating is only hovering around the 40% mark, he's still doing better than Clinton, who only had 37% approval at 138 days in.
[00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:31.584]  Of course, Trump's disapproval rating is also higher than Clinton's, at 57% compared to Clinton's 49%.
[00:51:32.125 --> 00:51:32.945]  But what do you expect?
[00:51:33.145 --> 00:51:37.209]  Bill Clinton was lauded as the poster boy of everything cool about modern liberalism.
[00:51:37.389 --> 00:51:42.735]  Meanwhile, Trump and his family have been put under a microscope and have been under constant assault even before he got elected.
[00:51:42.915 --> 00:51:49.302]  Despite all the negativity, Trump's numbers continue to climb, which is proof that the fake media's narrative is dying.
[00:51:49.603 --> 00:51:52.326]  Reporting for InfoWars.com, I'm Jay Michaels.

[00:54:01.578 --> 00:54:12.241]  Ladies and gentlemen, everybody knows that when I see something that looks negative for our cause of restoring the republic, cutting taxes, defeating the globalists, getting us out of the UN,
[00:54:13.615 --> 00:54:14.736]  Restoring our sovereignty.
[00:54:14.756 --> 00:54:16.838]  When I see something bad happening, I'll tell you.
[00:54:16.858 --> 00:54:18.019]  When we're losing, I'll tell you.
[00:54:18.659 --> 00:54:19.940]  I don't put spin on things.
[00:54:24.544 --> 00:54:29.168]  But when you look at what happened today, this was a disaster for Comey.
[00:54:29.808 --> 00:54:32.791]  We've got a clip coming up, because I've got to do these in order.
[00:54:33.953 --> 00:54:36.694]  Where he says, I'm kind of cowardly, hit out with my wife.
[00:54:37.355 --> 00:54:39.976]  You know, I had this stuff, it was disturbing, but I didn't tell anybody.
[00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:44.639]  Because that's a crime, if he thinks something's going on illegal, which he's already said through his surrogates.
[00:54:45.299 --> 00:54:46.460]  And then he didn't give it to Congress.
[00:54:47.961 --> 00:54:49.221]  He didn't give it to the Intelligence Committee.
[00:54:49.381 --> 00:54:52.003]  He didn't give it to his superiors at the Justice Department.
[00:54:55.224 --> 00:54:55.965]  And it goes on and on.
[00:54:55.985 --> 00:55:01.808]  And then admitting Loretta Lynch tried to influence him, because he knows there's evidence of it.
[00:55:03.595 --> 00:55:04.456]  Or he wouldn't be saying that.
[00:55:04.476 --> 00:55:11.726]  I mean, he knows she did it, obviously, but he knows they've got evidence, so he's trying to cover up now like it was no big deal.
[00:55:11.966 --> 00:55:13.909]  It was illegal for Bill Clinton to get on that plane with her.
[00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:15.190]  And that's why he came out.
[00:55:16.007 --> 00:55:18.149]  And reopen the investigation for just a couple days.
[00:55:18.749 --> 00:55:24.633]  He's now admitted that to make it look like he wasn't being told what to do, to make it look like he hadn't committed crimes.
[00:55:24.893 --> 00:55:26.194]  This is incredible!
[00:55:26.595 --> 00:55:39.304]  They've started an investigation on Trump, and it's totally blown up in their face, but the whore, lying, decepticon, sewage, prostitute, New World Order, dinosaur, anti-America,
[00:55:40.393 --> 00:55:47.054]  Evil media is in full spin mode of, oh, more evidence of the Russians, things just got deeper for Trump.
[00:55:47.334 --> 00:55:50.955]  This totally validated Trump on not trying to influence on Russia.
[00:55:51.255 --> 00:55:54.676]  It totally validated everything Trump said.
[00:55:55.776 --> 00:55:58.297]  And then Comey admits he's the leaker.
[00:55:59.617 --> 00:56:00.277]  Wow!
[00:56:00.577 --> 00:56:03.038]  I mean, boom, boom, boom!
[00:56:03.338 --> 00:56:04.998]  This is explosive!
[00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:09.490]  I feel sorry for the crew today.
[00:56:09.550 --> 00:56:11.191]  I am bouncing off the walls.
[00:56:11.471 --> 00:56:12.392]  Well, they're bouncing off the walls, too.
[00:56:12.412 --> 00:56:13.052]  This is incredible.
[00:56:13.792 --> 00:56:15.373]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to open the phones up.
[00:56:15.413 --> 00:56:16.093]  Gavin McGinnis is coming up.
[00:56:16.113 --> 00:56:17.254]  We're going to play a bunch of these clips.
[00:56:18.654 --> 00:56:20.315]  I'm going to play the Loretta Lynch when we come back.
[00:56:20.415 --> 00:56:21.775]  I'm going to play the cowardly clip.
[00:56:21.835 --> 00:56:25.697]  I'm going to play the New York Times Russia collusion story wrong, not true.
[00:56:27.998 --> 00:56:34.340]  That's why they're saying it's now a criminal investigation, hoping Flynn didn't answer the questions right or they can catch a bank account that's wrong or something.
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:38.122]  You know, they're dealing with something else or paperwork that wasn't filed because they're desperate.
[00:56:39.947 --> 00:56:41.028]  Oh, praise God for this.
[00:56:41.348 --> 00:56:44.250]  You talk about the Bible says you'll dig a pit for somebody and you'll fall in it.
[00:56:46.951 --> 00:56:50.093]  So many times my enemies attack me and then what they do to me ends up happening to them.
[00:56:50.113 --> 00:56:50.933]  I don't even have to do it.
[00:56:51.914 --> 00:56:53.815]  And I just think Trump has providence.
[00:56:53.855 --> 00:56:54.756]  We should pray for Trump.
[00:56:55.076 --> 00:56:55.916]  We should pray for America.
[00:56:55.936 --> 00:56:58.458]  We should pray for this whole world and for peace right now.
[00:56:59.617 --> 00:57:01.138]  Briefly, please support the broadcast.
[00:57:01.478 --> 00:57:07.300]  David Knight and that crew over there did such a supportive job with two plus three hours of live coverage.
[00:57:07.801 --> 00:57:10.142]  They kind of ended it early because crummy was getting destroyed in there.
[00:57:10.362 --> 00:57:12.343]  They looked like they had their asses handed to them.
[00:57:12.563 --> 00:57:13.083]  Praise God.
[00:57:13.663 --> 00:57:18.786]  This incredible crew, everybody, you the listeners that make it all possible, our affiliates, our sponsors, support them all.
[00:57:19.066 --> 00:57:21.947]  And please purchase products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:22.267 --> 00:57:23.588]  The Globals have tried to boycott us.
[00:57:23.608 --> 00:57:25.008]  They've tried to take our Google advertising.
[00:57:25.228 --> 00:57:25.629]  They have.
[00:57:25.869 --> 00:57:26.749]  They've tried to shut down our
[00:57:26.849 --> 00:57:28.490]  Our YouTube revenue, about 75%.
[00:57:29.071 --> 00:57:30.331]  Paul Watson has shown those graphs.
[00:57:31.472 --> 00:57:35.655]  But thanks to you, we're still able to slightly expand in the face of these attacks.
[00:57:35.715 --> 00:57:37.456]  But we've got to keep moving upstream here, folks.
[00:57:37.576 --> 00:57:38.857]  Like salmon, we can't give in.
[00:57:39.357 --> 00:57:42.059]  The new, amazing, best-selling toothpaste is back in.
[00:57:42.139 --> 00:57:45.121]  Superbloob in a new, even better, more space-age tube.

[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:49.985]  President Trump has a new nominee for the FBI Director, someone who was involved with the Bush administration.
[00:58:50.285 --> 00:58:54.869]  This comes after President Trump fires former FBI Director James Comey last month.
[00:58:55.089 --> 00:58:57.071]  Trump's nominee is Christopher Wray.
[00:58:57.251 --> 00:59:02.055]  In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump calls Wray a man of impeccable credentials.
[00:59:02.655 --> 00:59:08.320]  Including serving as the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division under George W. Bush.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:17.528]  Wray was integral to the DOJ's response to the attacks on September 11th, playing a role in the oversight and legal operational actions in the war on terrorism.
[00:59:17.688 --> 00:59:21.611]  And we all saw how good that turned out, possibly leading to the creation of ISIS.
[00:59:22.432 --> 00:59:27.436]  Ray was not part of the original shortlist as potential FBI directors being considered by the White House.
[00:59:27.716 --> 00:59:34.682]  But according to a source, Christopher Ray was interviewed by Mr. Trump and his name began to emerge as a strong possibility last week.
[00:59:34.882 --> 00:59:37.785]  Ray is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School.
[00:59:38.065 --> 00:59:42.328]  I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:59:45.331 --> 00:59:49.414]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:49.935 --> 00:59:51.196]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:02.017 --> 01:00:06.859]  Ladies and gentlemen, we come to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[01:00:08.192 --> 01:00:12.653]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:00:13.033 --> 01:00:16.094]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:17.354 --> 01:00:30.338]  Well, in the heat of the moment, the last two and a half hours with live coverage of the Comey hearings with David Knight and the rest of the crew, I was angry, I was focused, I was like a piranha running around trying to collate all the data.
[01:00:30.778 --> 01:00:33.939]  Our great writers and crew get the stories up on Infowars.com.
[01:00:34.299 --> 01:00:34.979]  It's amazing.
[01:00:36.124 --> 01:00:37.545]  To see us leading the coverage.
[01:00:37.945 --> 01:00:39.186]  Talking about how BOOM!
[01:00:40.207 --> 01:00:41.368]  He just perjured himself.
[01:00:41.748 --> 01:00:42.929]  Hour later, mainstream news.
[01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:43.850]  BOOM!
[01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:45.311]  He just admitted he's the leaker.
[01:00:45.912 --> 01:00:46.192]  BOOM!
[01:00:46.232 --> 01:00:47.353]  Mainstream news an hour later.
[01:00:48.093 --> 01:00:50.615]  It really shows how we are the new dominant news.
[01:00:50.915 --> 01:00:52.416]  Let's put DrugsReport.com up.
[01:00:52.456 --> 01:00:52.797]  You know what?
[01:00:52.817 --> 01:00:53.898]  I'm going to do that in the next segment.
[01:00:54.218 --> 01:00:56.019]  I want to just show some of the coverage and headlines there.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.401]  Gavin McGinnis is going to be joining us.
[01:00:58.421 --> 01:01:04.406]  We're going to be playing clips while he's on of some of the highlights of this hearing that they thought was going to be the Waterloo
[01:01:05.894 --> 01:01:08.976]  of Donald John Trump and the American people and our populist movement.
[01:01:09.297 --> 01:01:15.662]  And so many folks ask me, they say, Alex, you used to be so anti-government, so upset because it has been seized by the New World Order.
[01:01:16.022 --> 01:01:17.083]  I was never anti-government.
[01:01:17.343 --> 01:01:21.226]  I want limited constitutional government to protect my rights and my way of life.
[01:01:22.847 --> 01:01:23.608]  I love America.
[01:01:24.148 --> 01:01:27.871]  And the globalists are getting their butts kicked out of our government.
[01:01:29.008 --> 01:01:33.094]  And they're dug in like a bunch of ticks on the hind end of an old hound dog.
[01:01:33.134 --> 01:01:35.517]  But they're getting their butts pulled out there.
[01:01:36.498 --> 01:01:37.800]  This is a big time to be alive.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.261]  And you know what?
[01:01:38.281 --> 01:01:39.442]  It's a dangerous time to be alive.
[01:01:40.259 --> 01:01:42.441]  It's like I told globalist Megyn Kelly.
[01:01:43.061 --> 01:01:44.482]  We're going to break your New World Order.
[01:01:44.502 --> 01:01:45.183]  She said, me?
[01:01:45.883 --> 01:01:47.084]  I said, you represent it.
[01:01:47.124 --> 01:01:48.145]  You represent the establishment.
[01:01:48.185 --> 01:01:48.945]  Don't act like you don't.
[01:01:49.245 --> 01:01:50.366]  And you're going to be defeated.
[01:01:50.586 --> 01:01:52.948]  It doesn't mean I'm not going to be destroyed, sweetheart.
[01:01:53.689 --> 01:01:55.290]  This isn't about me getting out of here.
[01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:56.931]  It's about you getting beat.
[01:01:57.271 --> 01:01:57.972]  You understand that?
[01:01:57.992 --> 01:02:00.013]  It's about David Rockefeller getting beat.
[01:02:00.033 --> 01:02:02.495]  It's about Zbigniew Brzezinski getting beat.
[01:02:03.442 --> 01:02:13.167]  Long after they're dead, which they are now, it's about their New World Order failing, humanity succeeding, and those greedy, nasty robber barons feeding the ash heap of history.
[01:02:14.428 --> 01:02:19.190]  And already globalism's out in the open, the Federal Reserve's out in the open, the anti-family agenda's out in the open.
[01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:28.035]  You want to have your agendas, take over our lives, run us into the dirt, and we just sit here on the sidelines.
[01:02:28.055 --> 01:02:28.755]  That's not happening.
[01:02:29.275 --> 01:02:29.996]  You're gonna fail.
[01:02:31.536 --> 01:02:32.297]  Let's go to this clip.
[01:02:33.737 --> 01:02:35.238]  Of Loretta Lynch influence.
[01:02:35.298 --> 01:02:36.059]  This is big.
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:50.250]  Probably the only other consideration, I guess I can talk about an open setting, is that at one point the Attorney General had directed me not to call it an investigation, but instead to call it a matter, which confused me and concerned me.
[01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:57.836]  But that was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the department if we're to close this case credibly.
[01:02:59.737 --> 01:03:01.919]  You know, James Comey is what I talk about.
[01:03:03.387 --> 01:03:09.931]  When I talk about how the globalists are all cowards, they have all these interlocking boards and systems where no one ever really knows who gave the order.
[01:03:09.971 --> 01:03:14.033]  Nobody ever knows who, you know, approves the drug for hemophiliacs.
[01:03:14.053 --> 01:03:15.254]  They know it's gonna kill most of them.
[01:03:15.294 --> 01:03:19.917]  Or nobody knows who gave the order to inject the black people with syphilis at Tuskegee.
[01:03:20.017 --> 01:03:23.479]  Or nobody ever knows who gave the order to do this or that.
[01:03:23.759 --> 01:03:29.503]  It's just kind of in a consortium and they have consultants that come and certify it and you have auditors and
[01:03:30.683 --> 01:03:34.286]  Everything just kind of gets swept under the rug and nobody knows who did the DPP.
[01:03:34.586 --> 01:03:36.668]  Nobody knows who tried to ratify it in secret.
[01:03:36.908 --> 01:03:41.812]  Nobody knows how the Euro got control of Europe and is unelected and where it came from.
[01:03:41.832 --> 01:03:43.614]  Because they denied it existed until like 2000.
[01:03:43.654 --> 01:03:47.156]  There was a conspiracy theory previous to that out here.
[01:03:47.697 --> 01:03:54.042]  Back in the 70s, folks over at my parents' house going, they're going to have a European Union and then an Asian Union and then an American Union.
[01:03:54.062 --> 01:03:54.843]  It's going to merge.
[01:03:54.883 --> 01:03:56.104]  They're going to have a global tax.
[01:03:56.244 --> 01:03:59.967]  And they're going to track everything you do with the big supercomputers in Brussels, Belgium.
[01:04:01.348 --> 01:04:06.171]  I'm sitting there like five years old hearing this, and then here I am 40 years later.
[01:04:07.072 --> 01:04:08.573]  It all happened, didn't it?
[01:04:08.593 --> 01:04:19.401]  I remember sitting there as a child, and I just grew up thinking everybody knew that stuff.
[01:04:20.205 --> 01:04:22.987]  By the way, it wasn't like quacks or kooks that were over at my parents' house.
[01:04:23.507 --> 01:04:30.791]  It'd be like heads of major churches and FBI agents and cops and military people.
[01:04:30.811 --> 01:04:35.033]  And I'm just sitting there as a kid hearing this stuff and missionaries, you know, coming in the house and talking about it.
[01:04:35.053 --> 01:04:36.254]  We're going to beat the New World Order.
[01:04:36.554 --> 01:04:37.335]  It's just crazy.
[01:04:37.595 --> 01:04:39.616]  And just thank God for all those people.
[01:04:40.196 --> 01:04:42.377]  Because, man, they got attacked and called loons back then.
[01:04:42.417 --> 01:04:43.258]  But because of them,
[01:04:44.816 --> 01:04:51.367]  40 years later, we got Donald Trump, we got Nigel Farage, we got nationalist movements, and we've got victory.
[01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:57.138]  Imagine the world without InfoWars.
[01:05:00.578 --> 01:05:02.559]  The globalists have already consolidated their power.
[01:05:03.059 --> 01:05:06.760]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[01:05:07.461 --> 01:05:20.786]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[01:05:21.206 --> 01:05:26.368]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:05:27.108 --> 01:05:38.343]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate news and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[01:05:38.643 --> 01:05:41.187]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[01:05:42.361 --> 01:05:57.314]  And I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[01:05:57.654 --> 01:05:59.896]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[01:06:01.218 --> 01:06:12.886]  And it is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWareStore.com.
[01:06:14.367 --> 01:06:16.889]  On top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip,
[01:06:17.429 --> 01:06:23.011]  You get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[01:06:23.571 --> 01:06:26.193]  Emmerich's Essentials is all about personal care.
[01:06:26.633 --> 01:06:32.915]  Hygiene, not getting skin cancer, not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[01:06:33.395 --> 01:06:34.376]  It's all there.
[01:06:34.556 --> 01:06:39.418]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it.
[01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:41.178]  It's truly game-changing.
[01:06:41.639 --> 01:06:42.439]  BOA spray.
[01:06:42.759 --> 01:06:44.779]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:49.061]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[01:06:49.421 --> 01:06:51.701]  And it is comparable in price.
[01:06:51.981 --> 01:06:53.422]  And again, it's concentrated.
[01:06:53.762 --> 01:06:55.182]  The deodorant is amazing.
[01:06:55.642 --> 01:06:56.323]  High quality.
[01:06:57.003 --> 01:06:58.543]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[01:06:58.843 --> 01:06:59.564]  Totally natural.
[01:06:59.844 --> 01:07:00.324]  Works great.
[01:07:01.264 --> 01:07:05.029]  SPF 30 face and body lotion sunscreen unscented.
[01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:10.375]  This is exciting because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[01:07:10.395 --> 01:07:12.797]  Because everyone knows I'm obsessed with Wynn Wynns.
[01:07:12.817 --> 01:07:13.498]  20% off what it is retail.
[01:07:16.021 --> 01:07:17.141]  Because we cut out the middleman.
[01:07:17.922 --> 01:07:21.823]  And then, additionally, you sign up for auto-ship out of the gates.
[01:07:21.843 --> 01:07:22.344]  25% off that.
[01:07:22.844 --> 01:07:24.865]  Because I want you to try these products.
[01:07:25.005 --> 01:07:26.245]  I want you to love these products.
[01:07:26.585 --> 01:07:37.210]  I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win, a non-zero-sum game, where you get high quality, you get value, and you repeat order something you need every month.
[01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:45.716]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[01:07:45.996 --> 01:07:50.639]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[01:07:59.125 --> 01:08:04.449]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[01:08:05.976 --> 01:08:12.480]  The truth is humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[01:08:14.802 --> 01:08:17.463]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:47.963 --> 01:08:55.172]  Ladies and gentlemen... You know I don't put a pretty face on things unless it's a pretty face.
[01:08:56.315 --> 01:09:00.179]  And Comey just self-destructed in front of the world.
[01:09:00.239 --> 01:09:09.327]  Comey just melted down, and the media is trying to change the subject to Marco Rubio's hair, or, oh, the Russian investigation goes on, this adds weight to it.
[01:09:09.767 --> 01:09:15.832]  He said that he's the leaker, and that the New York Times and others got it wrong, what was even in the memo.
[01:09:16.233 --> 01:09:18.795]  So he commits a crime, because he didn't bring it to his superiors.
[01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:19.916]  He's deeply troubled.
[01:09:20.236 --> 01:09:21.397]  He admits that.
[01:09:21.697 --> 01:09:22.838]  He doesn't bring it to them.
[01:09:23.519 --> 01:09:28.868]  He testifies on May 3rd, two months later, after the meeting, that no one's tried to influence him.
[01:09:29.369 --> 01:09:32.014]  Senator Burr asked him again, did Trump try to ever influence you?
[01:09:32.294 --> 01:09:34.218]  He said, no, he didn't do that.
[01:09:34.238 --> 01:09:35.059]  He didn't try to order me.
[01:09:36.144 --> 01:09:36.765]  It's unbelievable.
[01:09:36.925 --> 01:09:41.669]  Their entire case, again, completely and totally implodes.
[01:09:41.909 --> 01:09:45.292]  Then they add all these cherries on top, where he says, I'm cowardly.
[01:09:45.672 --> 01:09:47.134]  I hid out.
[01:09:47.714 --> 01:09:52.959]  He goes on to say that the New York Times Russia collusion story was wrong in the main.
[01:09:53.039 --> 01:09:53.579]  That's a quote.
[01:09:53.919 --> 01:09:58.824]  He goes on to say Loretta Lynch ordered him to not call an investigation of the email server.
[01:10:00.174 --> 01:10:00.955]  Of Hillary Clinton.
[01:10:01.515 --> 01:10:14.408]  And then he kills the investigation, and when it comes out she's colluding with Clinton, he then reopens it for a couple days to look strong, and then admits that's why he did that!
[01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:19.373]  So, we have him passing, classified info to his friends.
[01:10:21.114 --> 01:10:24.237]  We have him admitting that he was never ordered by Trump to stop.
[01:10:25.118 --> 01:10:25.698]  It's amazing.
[01:10:25.718 --> 01:10:27.340]  I'm going to play all these clips.
[01:10:28.021 --> 01:10:28.641]  It's coming up.
[01:10:28.841 --> 01:10:32.144]  Live coverage right now on this Thursday edition.
[01:10:32.224 --> 01:10:32.905]  But wow!
[01:10:33.425 --> 01:10:45.076]  I am really surprised Comey went and even testified because he looked weak, he contradicted himself, he floundered, and he then had to confirm everything Trump said.
[01:10:45.336 --> 01:10:46.958]  He was never under investigation.
[01:10:48.516 --> 01:10:50.777]  And he never told him, drop the investigation.
[01:10:50.797 --> 01:10:52.899]  He said, gee, I hope you can see it clear to do this.
[01:10:53.199 --> 01:10:55.801]  Now Gavin McGinnis is the founder of Vice News, everybody knows.
[01:10:56.761 --> 01:11:00.384]  He's syndicated radio and TV host, English-born writer and comedian.
[01:11:01.545 --> 01:11:05.348]  And of course, compoundmedia.com, Twitter, at Gavin underscore McGinnis.
[01:11:05.909 --> 01:11:10.873]  We really appreciate him joining us to talk about all the things that are going on.
[01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:13.356]  I haven't talked to him, previous to him coming on.
[01:11:13.476 --> 01:11:15.297]  We just get him on every few weeks.
[01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:16.298]  He's great, he doesn't have to come on.
[01:11:16.578 --> 01:11:23.545]  But obviously, I want to get his take on did he watch the hearings, and what does he think of the hearings, and does he agree with me on what just happened?
[01:11:23.685 --> 01:11:24.265]  I don't know!
[01:11:25.382 --> 01:11:33.129]  How the media, how the horror media, how the dinosaur media puts Humpty Dumpty back together again, because this to me was a bloodbath.
[01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:42.818]  Even though they were trying to prop him up, they ended up ending it about 20 minutes early and looked like, you know, rats running out of an aqueduct.
[01:11:42.838 --> 01:11:44.200]  Gavin McGinnis, what do you think?
[01:11:45.572 --> 01:11:58.142]  I think it's amazing how the left keeps putting all their eggs into one basket, and then that basket turns out to have a hole in the bottom, and instead of going, uh-oh, I guess I'm wrong, they just move their eggs to the next basket.
[01:11:58.423 --> 01:12:06.910]  Like, they pin all their hopes on some giant myth, and then when it doesn't work out, they never scratch their head like a scientist would and go, maybe I'm wrong.
[01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:07.950]  On this crusade.
[01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:11.251]  They just keep going, all right, well, let's put them all over here now.
[01:12:11.751 --> 01:12:13.332]  And they're unflappable.
[01:12:13.352 --> 01:12:21.994]  Like, it's sort of like, you know, these cults where they say the world is going to end on August 12, 2016, and then it doesn't end and you go, well, that's the end of that cult.
[01:12:22.254 --> 01:12:23.594]  No, they just move the date up.
[01:12:24.034 --> 01:12:32.997]  So I don't think they're going to be that thwarted by all this evidence that the James Comey smoking gun isn't the James Comey smoking gun they wanted it to be.
[01:12:33.997 --> 01:12:37.699]  I agree with you, and they are a cult, and sociologists are now admitting that.
[01:12:37.719 --> 01:12:41.762]  Worldwide, socialists, collectivists, they've seen North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, everywhere else.
[01:12:42.442 --> 01:12:43.583]  Europe creates a nightmare.
[01:12:43.603 --> 01:12:48.906]  Then they just double down on more Islamists coming in, and all the answers have feminists wear hijabs.
[01:12:49.146 --> 01:12:52.328]  We were joking just six months ago that feminists were starting to get into Islam.
[01:12:52.668 --> 01:12:56.815]  Now USA Today says that's the new thing to do if you're a feminist.
[01:12:58.578 --> 01:13:04.968]  Aren't they in danger though of becoming so insane in their own cult that it drives more moderate people back to reality?
[01:13:06.209 --> 01:13:12.411]  Yeah, well, you know what the funny thing about it is, what they end up doing is pushing people to the right, just out of spite.
[01:13:12.891 --> 01:13:17.933]  And another thing they're doing is politicizing people who normally wouldn't be political.
[01:13:18.353 --> 01:13:23.775]  So, they're screaming about Nazis and Comey and Trump and Russia, and eventually people start going,
[01:13:24.315 --> 01:13:26.176]  I'm going to check to see what you're screaming about.
[01:13:26.577 --> 01:13:27.217]  Oh, you're wrong.
[01:13:27.477 --> 01:13:31.400]  So they're accidentally creating an army against them.
[01:13:31.921 --> 01:13:36.084]  They are so annoying that they are getting people involved in politics.
[01:13:36.104 --> 01:13:37.405]  So it ends up being great for us.
[01:13:38.936 --> 01:13:47.108]  Well, when I was first telling people at the inauguration that I saw thousands of women having hijabs handed out to them, American flag hijabs, I said it live on air.
[01:13:47.649 --> 01:13:49.531]  People couldn't believe it, even though they were seeing it.
[01:13:50.112 --> 01:13:55.240]  And then I went on radio the next day when I got back to Austin on Sunday, and listeners didn't believe it.
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:14:13.009]  And then I pulled up news articles where it admitted that George Soros spent two hundred and something million just on those marches nationwide, and that it was actually an Islamic group running it nationwide with this lady we all know about that says mutilate women's genitals and jihad is good, running the women's marches.
[01:14:13.069 --> 01:14:19.593]  I mean, in what fruitcake fantasy land are the major feminist marches run by women and hijabs?
[01:14:20.713 --> 01:14:21.954]  It's even crazier than that.
[01:14:22.414 --> 01:14:23.875]  She advocates for Sharia law.
[01:14:24.135 --> 01:14:26.036]  She's wearing a hijab.
[01:14:26.436 --> 01:14:28.197]  That means that she's pro-life.
[01:14:28.298 --> 01:14:31.019]  By definition, you can't wear that and be pro-choice.
[01:14:31.419 --> 01:14:36.022]  Yet, pro-life women were banned from coming on the march.
[01:14:36.582 --> 01:14:41.365]  They also have this black woman there, I forget her name, Donna Hilton or something.
[01:14:41.465 --> 01:14:44.907]  She murdered a gay man by sodomizing him to death.
[01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:47.669]  She's up there talking in front of LGBT people.
[01:14:48.089 --> 01:14:49.730]  And you watch this and you go, you know what this is?
[01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:55.614]  This is a microcosm of what society would be like if I handed you the keys to the city.
[01:14:56.015 --> 01:14:58.476]  And it would be a complete catastrophe.
[01:14:58.536 --> 01:14:59.517]  Oh, that's another great point.
[01:14:59.557 --> 01:15:03.280]  I forgot, at the same march up there on D.C., it was like the Legion of Doom.
[01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.802]  This woman wants Sharia law and sexual mutilation.
[01:15:06.022 --> 01:15:11.747]  This woman raped a man to death with a broomstick and beat him to death and was convicted.
[01:15:12.087 --> 01:15:14.129]  And I remember reading that, I'm like, what?
[01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:16.851]  And it's all these gay people going, yay, we love you!
[01:15:16.871 --> 01:15:17.932]  Ah, it's so wonderful!
[01:15:18.132 --> 01:15:19.072]  Kill Donald Trump!
[01:15:19.553 --> 01:15:19.653]  Ah!
[01:15:20.788 --> 01:15:24.510]  It's fascinating because they call you and me Nazis, and we go, no we're not.
[01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:30.433]  And they go, you're homophobic, you're a fascist, you want women to be second-class citizens.
[01:15:30.553 --> 01:15:40.317]  And you go, not only are you wrong about that accusation, but everything you just said applies to the two women sitting right next to you that are running your movement.
[01:15:40.818 --> 01:15:42.579]  I have to take control here.
[01:15:42.839 --> 01:15:45.200]  We need the patriarchy because it's better for you.
[01:15:46.641 --> 01:15:52.147]  The left is less oppressed if we don't let them run the show because they are saboteurs.
[01:15:52.287 --> 01:15:58.273]  Why do they run, and then we'll get back to the hearings with Gavin McGinnis joining us here, why do they run though to the most oppressive weird thing?
[01:15:59.335 --> 01:16:02.817]  I guess just like toddlers throwing a fit, riding on the wall with their own crap?
[01:16:03.518 --> 01:16:04.498]  It's the most violent.
[01:16:05.179 --> 01:16:15.806]  I remember, I think it was in World War II, we found this crazy tribe of little midgets in India who were particularly sadistic and they were incredible fighters.
[01:16:16.406 --> 01:16:19.228]  And they didn't really have an allegiance to Britain, but Britain used them.
[01:16:19.268 --> 01:16:20.049]  I forget the name of them.
[01:16:20.069 --> 01:16:23.691]  They've got a funny little name, and they're like five feet tall, and they were incredible warriors.
[01:16:24.152 --> 01:16:27.334]  And we used them to colonize India and all over the world.
[01:16:27.414 --> 01:16:28.495]  It was a very effective team.
[01:16:28.775 --> 01:16:31.657]  In fact, they're fighting for veterans' rights now as Brits.
[01:16:31.697 --> 01:16:32.097]  But anyway...
[01:16:33.086 --> 01:16:36.088]  The reason that Britain chose them is because they're just ruthless.
[01:16:36.208 --> 01:16:44.374]  And I think the left is choosing radical Islam not because they agree with them philosophically, but because they're very effective, violent human beings.
[01:16:44.694 --> 01:16:49.617]  They are great henchmen because they have no morals and are happy to stab a woman.
[01:16:49.657 --> 01:16:52.059]  We just saw what they do to children in Manchester.
[01:16:52.339 --> 01:17:03.026]  So the left is so amoral, immoral, they're so sadistic that they go, I know we don't trust these guys, but let's just use them anyway to blow up the world because that's all we want is sabotage.
[01:17:03.406 --> 01:17:03.986]  Well said.
[01:17:04.046 --> 01:17:05.707]  Gavin McGinnis is our guest to balance the hour.
[01:17:05.967 --> 01:17:09.128]  The phone's up here in about 20 minutes, but I want to play some more of these clips for everybody.
[01:17:09.588 --> 01:17:11.228]  Let's play this one because there's so many here.
[01:17:11.528 --> 01:17:15.550]  Comey says that he was weak, cowardly, and afraid to speak his mind.
[01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:20.311]  So his excuse for not going to the Justice Department when he thought something had been done wrong.
[01:17:20.931 --> 01:17:27.957]  was to write a memo and then leak it to the press, but then admit that the president didn't do anything illegal and didn't order him to.
[01:17:28.037 --> 01:17:38.806]  So, what's happening here is, I'm a Democrat appointee, I'm an operative, I've been caught, the Republicans are in power, I'm scared, just leave me alone, I'm a possum, I'm playing dead.
[01:17:39.047 --> 01:17:40.688]  But the truth is, he didn't play dead.
[01:17:40.988 --> 01:17:46.313]  He went and made up this memo, then perjured himself to Congress two months ago, saying nobody tried to influence him.
[01:17:46.553 --> 01:17:49.636]  And now in the hot seat again, he's saying no one did order him.
[01:17:49.857 --> 01:17:52.479]  So here's the clip of Comey saying he's a yellow belly.
[01:17:54.702 --> 01:18:02.370]  April 11th, did he ask you more ever about the Russia investigation?
[01:18:02.670 --> 01:18:04.011]  Did he ask you any questions?
[01:18:05.433 --> 01:18:06.834]  We never spoke again after April 11th.
[01:18:11.059 --> 01:18:15.143]  You told the president I would see what we could do.
[01:18:15.804 --> 01:18:16.504]  What did you mean?
[01:18:16.524 --> 01:18:23.291]  I was kind of a slightly cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him we're not going to do that.
[01:18:23.951 --> 01:18:25.373]  That I would see what we could do.
[01:18:25.393 --> 01:18:28.656]  It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly.
[01:18:29.116 --> 01:18:33.500]  And then I turned and handed it to the acting Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Bente.
[01:18:35.754 --> 01:18:38.535]  So again, what do you think Comey's really trying to do?
[01:18:38.555 --> 01:18:46.739]  I mean, I know he was at this big corrupt bank with the Clintons, and all tied under the Russians, and so is Hillary, so is the Podestas, so is Maxine Waters.
[01:18:46.759 --> 01:18:49.140]  I mean, I think they created the Russian era.
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:56.164]  In fact, I've been told this by higher-ups, you know, that are smarter than I am in this world with the amount of information they have.
[01:18:57.392 --> 01:19:02.239]  That that's what's happening, that they're really basically on the Communist Chinese payroll and the Russians payroll.
[01:19:02.439 --> 01:19:04.362]  But Gavin McGinnis, what do you think's happening here?
[01:19:04.402 --> 01:19:06.165]  I mean, maybe your pay grade's higher than mine.
[01:19:06.185 --> 01:19:07.126]  Maybe you know what's going on.
[01:19:07.346 --> 01:19:08.628]  No, no, you're way smarter than me.
[01:19:08.728 --> 01:19:09.810]  I can't figure this out.
[01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:12.414]  But I do know that Trump was ridiculed.
[01:19:12.774 --> 01:19:14.815]  For having a bad feeling about Comey.
[01:19:15.155 --> 01:19:16.836]  He must be wrong.
[01:19:16.876 --> 01:19:17.676]  Trump's always wrong.
[01:19:18.056 --> 01:19:21.078]  Then we find out that everything that Trump said was true.
[01:19:21.438 --> 01:19:23.279]  How many times has this happened, by the way?
[01:19:23.599 --> 01:19:28.121]  Where Trump looks paranoid and he's got a hunch and we say, that's insane.
[01:19:28.821 --> 01:19:31.542]  And it turns out everything Trump predicted was true.
[01:19:31.582 --> 01:19:33.723]  Now, I don't think this guy is a wizard.
[01:19:33.983 --> 01:19:35.084]  I don't think he's Gandalf.
[01:19:35.564 --> 01:19:43.193]  I think what he does is, he's smart enough to employ people who do great research for him and say, hey Don, Comey's bad news.
[01:19:43.373 --> 01:19:45.015]  And he goes, yeah, I was getting that by you.
[01:19:45.035 --> 01:19:46.316]  That's right, Gavin McGinnis, stay there.
[01:19:46.336 --> 01:19:49.780]  Well I know Trump loves you, I know he loves me, and he also goes with his gut.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.163]  And he is kind of like Gandalf, come on, let's admit it.
[01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:00.709]  Let's go to Manchester.
[01:20:01.090 --> 01:20:04.114]  We're reporting from the ground is Tommy Robinson.
[01:20:04.694 --> 01:20:06.617]  Tommy, wow, tell us what you're doing, where you're going.
[01:20:07.825 --> 01:20:18.772]  Well, we're walking through the city and we're here today, during the day, you'll be able to see the videos going up on Red Bull, where there was, there was, there was prompt scares everywhere.
[01:20:18.812 --> 01:20:20.053]  People were running through the shopping centres.
[01:20:20.813 --> 01:20:24.075]  Even now, I think if a balloon went off, the whole city would run from fear.
[01:20:24.476 --> 01:20:25.356]  And there's a vigil.
[01:20:25.676 --> 01:20:33.541]  So, organised by Andy Burnham, who is the MP who is working with the Muslim extremist group, who shares a platform with them.
[01:20:33.581 --> 01:20:34.382]  He's organising the vigil.
[01:20:35.299 --> 01:20:37.040]  He's now the mayor of Greater Manchester.
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:39.441]  He's in charge of the whole police force.
[01:20:40.182 --> 01:20:42.263]  So he's organized a vigil for people to come together.
[01:20:42.283 --> 01:20:43.783]  This is one of the vigils which you see across.
[01:20:43.883 --> 01:20:45.344]  And so he can be the hero.
[01:20:45.664 --> 01:20:46.865]  He can know the peace.
[01:20:46.905 --> 01:20:48.106]  Let's run up white flags.
[01:20:48.406 --> 01:20:49.386]  Let me be your boss.
[01:20:49.426 --> 01:20:50.507]  Just lay down.
[01:20:50.787 --> 01:20:52.508]  Let us put the handcuffs on.
[01:20:52.788 --> 01:20:54.109]  Get in the yellow Volkswagen.
[01:20:54.389 --> 01:20:55.509]  Let us get you in the basement.
[01:20:55.930 --> 01:20:56.190]  Go ahead.
[01:20:57.406 --> 01:20:57.726]  That's it.
[01:20:58.066 --> 01:20:58.887]  That's it.
[01:20:58.967 --> 01:21:01.088]  And that's what... I didn't even know this.
[01:21:01.128 --> 01:21:03.990]  I've only just started researching Manchester since I got up here this morning.
[01:21:04.711 --> 01:21:08.573]  And again, just... I've only had to scratch beneath the surface.
[01:21:08.593 --> 01:21:11.335]  It took me 10 minutes to find things out.
[01:21:11.355 --> 01:21:12.175]  10 minutes to find things out.
[01:21:12.195 --> 01:21:16.958]  But I believe now, this is one of these vigils where... It doesn't do anything, does it?
[01:21:17.579 --> 01:21:19.140]  I understand the feeling of coming together.
[01:21:19.884 --> 01:21:25.629]  It's not gonna... But it makes the people that allowed it to happen look like they care about everybody on the conciliators.
[01:21:25.649 --> 01:21:26.950]  They're the people standing up there.
[01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:33.055]  As I said, my mum was an immigrant to this country and she embraced it and as her children we embrace it and that's the same with them.
[01:21:33.075 --> 01:21:34.716]  They've embraced it and love it.
[01:21:34.876 --> 01:21:36.738]  But there's one section of the community who don't.
[01:21:37.098 --> 01:21:39.600]  One section of immigrants who have come here who refuse to.
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.021]  Who are now third generation.
[01:21:41.041 --> 01:21:42.642]  I believe this man was second generation.
[01:21:43.123 --> 01:21:45.305]  But second and third generation, the problem is getting worse and worse.
[01:21:46.095 --> 01:21:46.936]  Problems getting worse and worse.
[01:21:46.956 --> 01:21:52.199]  The hatred, the pure hatred against our way of life, our culture, our history, everything about it.
[01:21:52.219 --> 01:21:53.920]  We've lost our identity as English people.
[01:21:54.441 --> 01:21:55.241]  We've lost our history.
[01:21:55.261 --> 01:21:58.903]  We've not been allowed to be proud in who we are, proud in our history or our culture.
[01:21:59.324 --> 01:22:00.705]  So there's something missing anyway.
[01:22:00.845 --> 01:22:01.905]  So Islam fills that void.
[01:22:02.406 --> 01:22:05.067]  They've then joined Islam and they're allowed to be proud in their identity.
[01:22:05.748 --> 01:22:12.432]  And they're given a real strong sense of belief and identity and belonging, which has been lost, purposely lost, orchestrated.
[01:22:12.652 --> 01:22:13.313]  They've done that on purpose.
[01:22:13.948 --> 01:22:16.330]  I said most English kids who are 16 are walking around with their heads down.
[01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:18.011]  Walking around with their heads down.
[01:22:18.711 --> 01:22:23.154]  So they take culture away and then bring in either leftist globalism or Islam.
[01:22:23.474 --> 01:22:25.155]  Why do you think the left is so allied?
[01:22:25.275 --> 01:22:29.097]  Again, Tommy Robinson on the ground in Manchester investigating live.
[01:22:29.518 --> 01:22:32.960]  Why do you think that the left is so allied with Islam?
[01:22:34.691 --> 01:22:39.853]  I always say it's the Marxists and Communists aligning with Islam, and they both hate each other.
[01:22:40.113 --> 01:22:41.293]  But they're simply using each other.
[01:22:42.054 --> 01:22:42.654]  Yay!
[01:22:42.714 --> 01:22:44.154]  Let's run up the white flag!
[01:22:44.194 --> 01:22:45.335]  Yay!
[01:22:45.635 --> 01:22:50.357]  Let's have the very people that ran up the white flag come and lead us into more bondage!
[01:22:50.457 --> 01:22:50.757]  Yes!
[01:22:54.232 --> 01:22:57.773]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:22:58.233 --> 01:23:04.275]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:23:04.515 --> 01:23:07.476]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[01:23:07.856 --> 01:23:10.857]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:23:11.057 --> 01:23:14.498]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:23:14.838 --> 01:23:16.598]  The left controls culture.
[01:23:16.618 --> 01:23:17.599]  They control arts.
[01:23:17.679 --> 01:23:18.899]  They control entertainment.
[01:23:19.179 --> 01:23:26.263]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:23:26.323 --> 01:23:28.725]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:23:29.205 --> 01:23:33.067]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:23:33.127 --> 01:23:41.212]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate the image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:23:41.472 --> 01:23:44.154]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter,
[01:23:44.534 --> 01:23:47.696]  It will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:23:47.776 --> 01:23:49.477]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:23:49.637 --> 01:23:50.818]  It's available right now.
[01:23:51.118 --> 01:23:53.680]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:23:55.401 --> 01:23:59.344]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[01:23:59.364 --> 01:24:02.686]  In the Mississippi River she's a gold drive.
[01:24:08.019 --> 01:24:11.220]  You nailed this down on page 5, paragraph 3.
[01:24:11.561 --> 01:24:12.621]  You put this in quotes.
[01:24:13.141 --> 01:24:13.862]  Words matter.
[01:24:14.242 --> 01:24:17.703]  You wrote down the words so we can all have the words in front of us now.
[01:24:18.043 --> 01:24:27.627]  There's 28 words there that are in quotes and it says, quote, I hope, this is the president speaking, I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.
[01:24:28.027 --> 01:24:28.888]  He is a good guy.
[01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:31.809]  I hope you can let this go.
[01:24:32.609 --> 01:24:34.630]  Now those are his exact words, is that correct?
[01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:35.010]  Correct.
[01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:36.810]  And you wrote them here and you put them in quotes?
[01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:37.210]  Correct.
[01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.630]  Okay.
[01:24:39.971 --> 01:24:40.611]  Thank you for that.
[01:24:40.931 --> 01:24:42.591]  He did not direct you to let it go.
[01:24:44.932 --> 01:24:46.092]  Not in his words, no.
[01:24:46.592 --> 01:24:47.753]  He did not order you to let it go.
[01:24:47.793 --> 01:24:48.513]  Not in his words.
[01:24:49.333 --> 01:24:50.853]  Again, those words are not in order.
[01:24:51.053 --> 01:24:51.194]  No.
[01:24:51.954 --> 01:24:52.994]  He said, I hope.
[01:24:54.226 --> 01:25:01.409]  Now, like me, you probably did hundreds of cases, maybe thousands of cases, charging people with criminal offenses.
[01:25:01.809 --> 01:25:06.651]  And, of course, you have knowledge of the thousands of cases out there where people have been charged.
[01:25:07.011 --> 01:25:21.157]  Do you know of any case where a person has been charged for obstruction of justice, or for that matter, any other criminal offense, where they said or thought they hoped for an outcome?
[01:25:22.904 --> 01:25:24.785]  I don't know well enough to answer.
[01:25:24.805 --> 01:25:29.788]  And the reason I keep saying his words is, I took it as a direction.
[01:25:30.789 --> 01:25:36.592]  As the President of the United States, with me alone saying, I hope this, I took it as, this is what he wants me to do.
[01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:38.913]  I didn't obey that, but that's the way I took it.
[01:25:39.093 --> 01:25:41.375]  You may have taken it as a direction, but that's not what he said.
[01:25:41.415 --> 01:25:42.495]  Correct.
[01:25:42.655 --> 01:25:43.596]  He said, I hope.
[01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:44.857]  Those are exact words.
[01:25:44.897 --> 01:25:45.197]  Correct.
[01:25:45.797 --> 01:25:48.379]  You don't know of anyone that's ever been charged for hoping something.
[01:25:48.439 --> 01:25:49.379]  Is that a fair statement?
[01:25:49.479 --> 01:25:50.460]  I don't as I sit here.
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:51.080]  Thank you.
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:51.741]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[01:25:52.521 --> 01:25:55.282]  All right, that's Senator Risch from Idaho, who did a great job.
[01:25:55.302 --> 01:25:58.064]  We're going to go back to Gavin McInnes here in the short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:25:58.204 --> 01:26:00.805]  But ladies and gentlemen, you just saw two big things there.
[01:26:00.825 --> 01:26:03.006]  I'll ask Gavin if he agrees with me and what else he sees.
[01:26:03.026 --> 01:26:05.547]  And we're going to ask you when we open the phones up what you saw.
[01:26:06.888 --> 01:26:16.572]  But he commits perjury there, because he said in a May 3rd congressional testimony that we played earlier, we're going to play in the next segment,
[01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:24.828]  That no one ever tried to influence anybody on his Russia investigation or anything else concerning it.
[01:26:26.610 --> 01:26:30.972]  But two months before, he writes a memo saying he thinks the president did try to influence him.
[01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:34.235]  But now he says, but not in words.
[01:26:35.956 --> 01:26:39.698]  So you talk about this guy is a bigger weasel than Bill Clinton.
[01:26:39.758 --> 01:26:41.119]  This is so incredible.
[01:26:41.359 --> 01:26:46.743]  But here he is, though, letting the memo go out to his friend, letting them misrepresent what's in it.
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:55.923]  And saying he was ordered, though he wasn't ordered, but then like a weasel to hurt Trump, he says though he still felt like it, because he knows there's perjury.
[01:26:57.023 --> 01:26:59.004]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm so proud of InfoWars.
[01:26:59.064 --> 01:27:03.445]  We pointed this out, we got attacked everywhere, they called it fake news when we played the clip.
[01:27:04.866 --> 01:27:05.786]  Next level.
[01:27:06.046 --> 01:27:07.527]  Gatham, again, what do you make of this?
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:16.107]  You know, I think what's really going on here is America isn't used to a real deal dude as president.
[01:27:16.127 --> 01:27:20.011]  They're not used to this level of transparency where he says, you know what, you want to investigate me?
[01:27:20.111 --> 01:27:21.012]  Go nuts.
[01:27:21.092 --> 01:27:23.054]  Let's go Russian collusion, whatever you want.
[01:27:23.074 --> 01:27:23.554]  Let's do it.
[01:27:23.955 --> 01:27:24.876]  You can see everything.
[01:27:25.376 --> 01:27:27.598]  And they go, well, something must be up here.
[01:27:27.878 --> 01:27:30.440]  And then we get the guy in a courtroom.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.080]  We say, what happened?
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:34.703]  He said, he hoped that I wouldn't pursue this, but he didn't tell me not to.
[01:27:35.064 --> 01:27:42.009]  And that's why they can't find any smoking guns, because they just assume that if they're allowed this kind of freedom, there must be something terrible going on.
[01:27:42.049 --> 01:27:46.672]  Because we're used to Obama sending Susan Rice to talk shows to lie.
[01:27:46.973 --> 01:27:50.335]  We're used to Clinton's legacy of lies.
[01:27:50.535 --> 01:27:52.036]  We're not used to guys saying, go ahead.
[01:27:52.377 --> 01:27:53.077]  Go ahead and do it.
[01:27:53.097 --> 01:27:53.778]  I don't want you to.
[01:27:54.138 --> 01:27:54.798]  That was in evidence.
[01:27:54.838 --> 01:27:57.200]  His own surrogates go, no, it's not a travel ban.
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:58.701]  He goes, yeah, it is a travel ban.
[01:27:59.021 --> 01:28:02.944]  Or they go, oh no, he's not mad at Comey about Russia.
[01:28:02.964 --> 01:28:04.244]  And he goes, no, actually I am.
[01:28:04.405 --> 01:28:05.205]  He's totally insane.
[01:28:05.225 --> 01:28:05.845]  It's pure crap.
[01:28:05.865 --> 01:28:09.048]  And they go, oh my gosh, you did fire him for Russia being an agent.
[01:28:09.208 --> 01:28:11.189]  He's going, no, he's crazy.
[01:28:11.409 --> 01:28:12.410]  That's why he's fired.
[01:28:13.424 --> 01:28:17.625]  We're used to Kissinger just making problems go away in the dead of the night.
[01:28:17.845 --> 01:28:23.567]  We're not used to the guy that was elected on the basis of, I'm a real American, I'll do it right.
[01:28:23.927 --> 01:28:26.427]  And then he starts doing it right and we go, well something must be up here.
[01:28:26.727 --> 01:28:33.249]  But no, that's why every time you lift up a rock, you don't find the vermin you expect to find.
[01:28:33.589 --> 01:28:36.010]  Because Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do.
[01:28:36.330 --> 01:28:38.551]  He's being an honest American citizen.
[01:28:38.571 --> 01:28:39.531]  He's the only president...
[01:28:40.171 --> 01:28:42.572]  He's the only president in a hundred years that hasn't had lobbyists.
[01:28:42.612 --> 01:28:44.352]  He's the only one that ever got rid of them all.
[01:28:45.392 --> 01:28:45.632]  Yep.
[01:28:46.153 --> 01:28:54.175]  And it's telling too that we think that hope is something that you can be arrested for and you can go to jail for hope.
[01:28:54.435 --> 01:28:55.495]  We're not allowed to wonder.
[01:28:55.675 --> 01:28:59.076]  Remember Cliven Bundy said, I wonder if these guys would have been better off during slavery.
[01:28:59.356 --> 01:29:02.357]  He was wrong, but he was pilloried for wondering that.
[01:29:02.597 --> 01:29:05.899]  We keep getting people losing their careers for asking a question.
[01:29:06.239 --> 01:29:09.661]  And Trump implies, he goes, geez, I hope you would drop this.
[01:29:09.721 --> 01:29:19.187]  But no, that's got to be a criminal offense because we are so desperate to make him into Hitler that there must be some sort of dictatorship going on.
[01:29:19.327 --> 01:29:21.589]  And I don't think we can convince these people otherwise.
[01:29:21.629 --> 01:29:22.229]  I think we should give up.
[01:29:22.249 --> 01:29:22.429]  Well, sure.
[01:29:22.489 --> 01:29:27.873]  I mean, a judge isn't obstructing justice if you get up and say, I hope, your honor, you can let me have the speeding ticket.
[01:29:28.453 --> 01:29:29.813]  And this is the President, too.
[01:29:30.154 --> 01:29:32.914]  Alan Dershowitz says he could go even further under executive power.
[01:29:33.275 --> 01:29:33.515]  Maybe.
[01:29:33.555 --> 01:29:34.155]  It's arguable.
[01:29:34.375 --> 01:29:36.776]  But undoubtedly, you can say, hey, this guy's a great guy.
[01:29:36.796 --> 01:29:37.016]  You agree?
[01:29:37.036 --> 01:29:37.796]  Yeah, he's a great guy.
[01:29:38.076 --> 01:29:39.157]  Well, why don't we leave him alone?
[01:29:39.197 --> 01:29:39.657]  Give him a break.
[01:29:39.677 --> 01:29:40.417]  There's no real evidence.
[01:29:40.837 --> 01:29:42.858]  And Comey has admitted all that.
[01:29:42.998 --> 01:29:43.878]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.378 --> 01:29:45.979]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:46.899 --> 01:29:49.580]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.161 --> 01:29:59.686]  President Trump has a new nominee for the FBI Director, someone who was involved with the Bush administration.
[01:29:59.966 --> 01:30:04.610]  This comes after President Trump fires former FBI Director James Comey last month.
[01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:06.812]  Trump's nominee is Christopher Wray.
[01:30:07.012 --> 01:30:11.796]  In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump calls Wray a man of impeccable credentials.
[01:30:12.416 --> 01:30:18.060]  Including serving as the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division under George W. Bush.
[01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:27.265]  Wray was integral to the DOJ's response to the attacks on September 11th, playing a role in the oversight and legal operational actions in the war on terrorism.
[01:30:27.445 --> 01:30:31.127]  And we all saw how good that turned out, possibly leading to the creation of ISIS.
[01:30:32.188 --> 01:30:37.193]  Ray was not part of the original shortlist as potential FBI directors being considered by the White House.
[01:30:37.473 --> 01:30:44.419]  But according to a source, Christopher Ray was interviewed by Mr. Trump and his name began to emerge as a strong possibility last week.
[01:30:44.639 --> 01:30:47.542]  Ray is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School.
[01:30:47.822 --> 01:30:52.046]  I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:30:53.951 --> 01:31:01.718]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[01:31:01.918 --> 01:31:08.344]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds, even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[01:31:08.584 --> 01:31:16.871]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[01:31:17.131 --> 01:31:25.899]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:31.905]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[01:31:32.245 --> 01:31:32.706]  It works.
[01:31:33.006 --> 01:31:41.313]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[01:31:41.333 --> 01:31:50.861]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the Globalists all at the same time.
[01:31:51.221 --> 01:31:51.702]  A total 360 win.
[01:31:53.909 --> 01:31:55.331]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:32:24.076 --> 01:32:34.022]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:32:34.282 --> 01:32:36.183]  And this part is most important.
[01:32:36.323 --> 01:32:42.747]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standards.
[01:32:43.127 --> 01:32:44.248]  That means it's clean.
[01:32:44.568 --> 01:32:45.608]  That means it's pure.
[01:32:45.708 --> 01:32:48.529]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[01:32:48.589 --> 01:32:51.350]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:53.071]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:33:02.955 --> 01:33:04.156]  And I'm feeling good right now.
[01:33:05.336 --> 01:33:11.579]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:13.348 --> 01:33:17.690]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a smorgasbord of clips coming up through this hour and the next.
[01:33:17.730 --> 01:33:27.914]  David Knight, who covered in his own live feed we did this morning, the Comey implosion, will be joining us later in the next hour as well.
[01:33:28.735 --> 01:33:30.315]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:33:30.335 --> 01:33:30.375]  800-259-9231.
[01:33:30.395 --> 01:33:32.516]  One thing listeners that have listened a long time know.
[01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:43.350]  I don't come in here and get excited and tell you we're having a victory if we're not having one.
[01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:44.671]  Of course, you can see it for yourself.
[01:33:45.972 --> 01:33:47.854]  But I'm really excited here.
[01:33:47.954 --> 01:33:51.017]  This was spectacular.
[01:33:51.738 --> 01:33:56.662]  The problem is, most people don't have time to sit there and watch the three hour testimony.
[01:33:58.724 --> 01:34:00.025]  Or two and a half hour testimony.
[01:34:00.045 --> 01:34:00.846]  They ended a little bit early.
[01:34:02.147 --> 01:34:05.169]  And so, I'm looking at CNN, I'm looking
[01:34:06.144 --> 01:34:07.885]  At MSNBC, I'm looking at the New York Times.
[01:34:08.565 --> 01:34:10.966]  I'm seeing something different from what I actually saw.
[01:34:11.527 --> 01:34:13.788]  But that's why these people are losing their readers and viewers.
[01:34:14.928 --> 01:34:16.049]  He admitted to coming?
[01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:20.131]  I mean, this is just insane.
[01:34:20.151 --> 01:34:25.893]  We're going to go into all of it with Gavin McGinnis and then take a few of your phone calls in the balance of the next 25 minutes before I go any further.
[01:34:27.014 --> 01:34:30.836]  It is so important in the information war that the truth get out.
[01:34:30.936 --> 01:34:33.257]  We have the clips on InfoWars.com excised out.
[01:34:34.226 --> 01:34:44.149]  With Comey perjuring himself, with Comey admitting he's the leaker, with just incredible information up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:34:44.729 --> 01:34:46.589]  And you know this went on.
[01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:47.710]  You were watching.
[01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:48.790]  You were listening.
[01:34:48.990 --> 01:34:49.910]  Maybe you're off today.
[01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:51.051]  Maybe it was your lunch hour.
[01:34:51.511 --> 01:34:55.012]  You've got to go to Infowars.com or our Facebook or our Twitter.
[01:34:56.115 --> 01:35:00.718]  And retweet, or get it out on Facebook, and grab these articles where he is caught.
[01:35:00.778 --> 01:35:03.459]  We have the different testimonies saying totally different things.
[01:35:03.899 --> 01:35:12.044]  We have him admitting that he did the leaking, that he released the memo, and that the news is twisting what was in the memo, and that Trump never ordered him to do anything.
[01:35:12.844 --> 01:35:16.586]  The media's all got more egg on its face lying about this.
[01:35:20.028 --> 01:35:21.389]  But what did Gruber say?
[01:35:22.614 --> 01:35:26.504]  Gruber said on Obamacare, I love the fact you have no memory.
[01:35:26.745 --> 01:35:28.409]  I love the fact that you're so stupid.
[01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:30.294]  I love the fact we can screw you over.
[01:35:31.909 --> 01:35:41.156]  Let Comey, let Hillary, let Obama, let Gruber, let Michael Moore, let all the George Soros usual suspects know, we have memories.
[01:35:41.597 --> 01:35:57.350]  We know what you did, and we're going to take the clips of his perjury, and we're going to take the clips of him now having to admit he did the leaking, and we're going to subpoena the journalist he gave the memo to, and we're going to get it all, and we're going to expose the leaking, because he admits nothing criminal happened in the memo.
[01:35:57.990 --> 01:36:05.314]  But he leaked a national security conversation with the president to the press to let the press for a month and a half put lies out to undermine him.
[01:36:05.334 --> 01:36:15.040]  I'm going to ask Gavin McGinnis of therebel.media and of course compoundmedia.com and Twitter, Gavin underscore McGinnis, what he thinks should be done.
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:22.484]  Because listen, we can get caught up laughing at these people and how ridiculous they are and how out of their minds they are.
[01:36:22.964 --> 01:36:23.665]  But you know what?
[01:36:25.319 --> 01:36:28.603]  They still run the universities, they still run the media, and they're still out to get us.
[01:36:28.903 --> 01:36:29.924]  And they've blocked Trump.
[01:36:30.705 --> 01:36:32.027]  He keeps bitching about it, he should.
[01:36:32.227 --> 01:36:35.891]  The State Department and everybody else, oh, we're bringing in record refugees.
[01:36:36.112 --> 01:36:37.373]  And all the courts are blocking you.
[01:36:37.553 --> 01:36:42.799]  And then his own agencies are following the courts when they should be following what he says under the Constitution.
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:44.842]  This is completely out of control.
[01:36:46.294 --> 01:36:48.757]  I mean, the courts were saying, you know, let the air traffic controllers have raises.
[01:36:49.057 --> 01:36:50.218]  Reagan fired their butts!
[01:36:50.859 --> 01:36:52.220]  So we'll talk about that with Gavin McGinnis.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.123]  We'll take your phone calls in a moment and play some more of these clips, just briefly.
[01:36:56.104 --> 01:36:56.825]  Spread the articles.
[01:36:58.246 --> 01:37:04.132]  Support the new media that's exploding, because we've got to get even bigger, because they're trying to shut us down, and financially.
[01:37:05.276 --> 01:37:07.778]  I thought, everybody loves iodine, everybody loves colloidal silver.
[01:37:07.818 --> 01:37:11.841]  Mix it with tea tree oil, mix it with a bunch of other great things like peppermint, organic.
[01:37:12.041 --> 01:37:14.342]  They're the biggest manufacturer of organic stuff in the country.
[01:37:14.683 --> 01:37:15.883]  Same folks that makes Tom's in Maine.
[01:37:17.104 --> 01:37:17.705]  And put it out.
[01:37:17.885 --> 01:37:20.246]  And my dad's, you know, a retiring oral surgeon and dentist.
[01:37:20.286 --> 01:37:21.047]  He still has his license.
[01:37:21.287 --> 01:37:21.868]  He developed it.
[01:37:22.508 --> 01:37:23.269]  It's a bestseller.
[01:37:23.489 --> 01:37:27.572]  Sold out for a couple months, it's back in in a new, even better, space-age tube.
[01:37:27.832 --> 01:37:29.053]  Buy it, support the broadcast.
[01:37:29.453 --> 01:37:32.255]  Clean your teeth, save your teeth, while you save the world from the globalists.

[01:37:43.938 --> 01:37:45.460]  Infowarslife.com.

[01:38:08.803 --> 01:38:10.465]  You can get those, absolutely.
[01:38:10.525 --> 01:38:13.129]  And of course, we just started selling them, so there's no real reviews on it.
[01:38:13.689 --> 01:38:23.943]  Our enemies, every time we have a new product, go to the Power Reviews, do some fake reviews, they drop it down to three stars, and once people actually get it, they all go vote on the products, and it gets, you know, 4.8 stars, the highest that Power Reviews and others have ever seen.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:25.200]  This is
[01:38:43.544 --> 01:38:45.645]  Get them, uh, auto-shipped.
[01:38:45.885 --> 01:38:46.405]  20% off retail.
[01:38:46.425 --> 01:38:48.386]  It's one of the top three organic brands in the country.
[01:38:48.786 --> 01:38:49.687]  Private label by us.
[01:38:49.727 --> 01:38:51.327]  That's why you recognize the bottle.
[01:38:51.687 --> 01:38:52.788]  Everybody's pretty much seen this.
[01:38:53.088 --> 01:38:55.049]  My daughter this morning says, I've seen this before, Dad.
[01:38:55.069 --> 01:38:56.389]  And I go, yeah, we use it.
[01:38:57.050 --> 01:39:03.032]  The brand name is this at Whole Foods, but the owner's a fan and lets us put it out 20% less directly to people.
[01:39:03.072 --> 01:39:05.993]  This is such a big deal because they've got a line of over 40 products.
[01:39:06.013 --> 01:39:06.914]  This is the first six.
[01:39:07.534 --> 01:39:13.636]  It's made in the USA, cruelty-free, all-natural, gluten-free, certified organic, SLS-free, chemical-free.
[01:39:14.137 --> 01:39:18.378]  It's the best out there at the price that's just unbelievable.
[01:39:18.658 --> 01:39:19.659]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:39:19.719 --> 01:39:20.539]  Okay, I'm done plugging.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:24.461]  But we do need your support now more than ever, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:24.821 --> 01:39:25.901]  Going back to Gavin McGinnis.
[01:39:25.921 --> 01:39:27.922]  Gavin, I've been asking some of the questions here.
[01:39:27.942 --> 01:39:32.344]  Before we play some more clips and go to calls, what else is on your radar?
[01:39:32.404 --> 01:39:33.484]  What do you want to talk about?
[01:39:33.604 --> 01:39:34.845]  And really, where do you think the
[01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:45.200]  The ball is in the fight for freedom with real liberalism, real constitutionalism, pro-human renaissance versus the cancer that's modern liberalism.
[01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:47.349]  Well, I have some great news.
[01:39:48.110 --> 01:39:59.192]  And the great news is that truth is on our side, and lies run sprints, and I'm still going to fight all of these people, but Comey is a great example of give him enough rope.
[01:39:59.713 --> 01:40:03.774]  And this guy is hanging himself, and the left is cannibalizing each other.
[01:40:04.074 --> 01:40:06.074]  Look at the three things that have come out today.
[01:40:06.534 --> 01:40:08.595]  One, he's conceded that he's a coward.
[01:40:09.255 --> 01:40:11.717]  Two, he's conceded that he was leaking.
[01:40:12.177 --> 01:40:15.100]  Three, he's conceded that Trump never told him to stop.
[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:17.001]  He just said he'd hope he would stop.
[01:40:17.302 --> 01:40:21.985]  And now we have CNN calling the New York Times fake news.
[01:40:22.285 --> 01:40:24.087]  So the left demanded we do this.
[01:40:24.287 --> 01:40:25.668]  They want to see what's going on with Comey.
[01:40:25.688 --> 01:40:27.830]  We said, okay, you want scrutiny?
[01:40:27.870 --> 01:40:28.891]  You want meritocracy?
[01:40:28.911 --> 01:40:29.571]  You want justice?
[01:40:29.872 --> 01:40:30.092]  Here.
[01:40:30.692 --> 01:40:32.773]  And we just see nothing but filth.
[01:40:32.873 --> 01:40:34.813]  And this is just happening right now with that guy.
[01:40:35.073 --> 01:40:36.494]  You know Kurt Eichenwald?
[01:40:37.014 --> 01:40:39.254]  He's a MSNBC guy.
[01:40:39.334 --> 01:40:39.494]  Yes!
[01:40:39.994 --> 01:40:49.637]  So a long time ago he was getting in an argument with someone on Twitter and they sent a GIF of, and then he, I think he lied, but he said he had a seizure from the GIF and prosecuted the guy.
[01:40:49.997 --> 01:40:52.798]  And you see that and you go, I wish I could get justice.
[01:40:52.898 --> 01:40:53.878]  I know he's lying.
[01:40:54.178 --> 01:40:55.258]  I feel it in my bones.
[01:40:55.358 --> 01:40:57.919]  I wish I could, there was some sort of retribution.
[01:40:57.979 --> 01:40:58.319]  And then you go,
[01:40:58.539 --> 01:40:59.519]  Just give him enough rope.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:07.143]  And then today, we catch him, he tweets out a picture of hentai porn on his computer.
[01:41:07.503 --> 01:41:09.604]  He didn't realize it was in the top tabs.
[01:41:09.984 --> 01:41:14.326]  And here we see he's looking at anime tentacle porn or something.
[01:41:14.386 --> 01:41:15.667]  Now let me be clear, I got...
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.101]  I mean, I know of this mostly through Kurt's defense.
[01:41:48.221 --> 01:42:12.841]  Well, I, without even surfing porn sites, but if you go to more, you know, racy sites to get news and info, they'll have pop-up where it'll show, like, anime, you know, girls kissing or something, and then, like, a big goblin jumps into the screen and starts, you know, trying to have sex with them.
[01:42:12.861 --> 01:42:13.482]  Is that what this is?
[01:42:14.321 --> 01:42:16.162]  Yes, it's strange rape porn.
[01:42:16.222 --> 01:42:17.183]  I don't know.
[01:42:17.583 --> 01:42:25.347]  The Japanese are sort of like a canary in a coal mine of our culture, and they've become so gender segregated that I don't think men even speak to women anymore.
[01:42:25.607 --> 01:42:30.370]  So they're off on some crazy porn tangent that's nine million years into the future.
[01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:31.730]  I hope we never get there.
[01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:37.874]  But they are enjoying this kind of filth, and a lot of sad perverts, I think, in the West are into it too.
[01:42:38.294 --> 01:42:40.015]  But the point of all this is,
[01:42:40.635 --> 01:42:46.559]  We were mad at Kurt for what we thought was lying, what we assume is lying, and he just hanged himself.
[01:42:46.819 --> 01:42:48.700]  So this just happened with Comey.
[01:42:48.921 --> 01:42:51.843]  This just keeps happening again and again with the left.
[01:42:52.123 --> 01:42:53.203]  They demand something.
[01:42:53.223 --> 01:42:55.025]  They demand meritocracy.
[01:42:55.045 --> 01:42:56.366]  They demand justice.
[01:42:56.506 --> 01:43:01.769]  And we end up learning how low on justice and low on merit everything about them is.
[01:43:02.109 --> 01:43:02.350]  Sure.
[01:43:02.630 --> 01:43:05.552]  And now that I think of it, I have had it pop on my phone, too.
[01:43:06.012 --> 01:43:07.353]  I guess it was from Japan.
[01:43:07.393 --> 01:43:08.314]  It had text on it.
[01:43:08.334 --> 01:43:09.674]  About a year ago, it was
[01:43:10.996 --> 01:43:15.467]  Xenomorphs from like the movie Alien raping children and then ripping them in half.
[01:43:15.588 --> 01:43:18.034]  And so I think that's what this is.
[01:43:18.094 --> 01:43:20.099]  It's like, basically it's snuff film porn.
[01:43:21.038 --> 01:43:21.318]  Yes.
[01:43:21.338 --> 01:43:23.059]  But it's not real, it's like simulated.
[01:43:23.779 --> 01:43:25.160]  Are you remotely surprised?
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:30.182]  You know, I had the New York Times interview me recently and they did a hit piece.
[01:43:30.722 --> 01:43:35.884]  We have a group called the Proud Boys, a multi-racial group that has plenty of gays, Jews, blacks, whatever.
[01:43:36.164 --> 01:43:46.789]  We're just Western chauvinists and we were started to create self-defense because I was getting pepper sprayed when I went to talks and Lauren Southern was getting attacked and Ann Coulter was having bricks thrown at her and getting banned.
[01:43:46.809 --> 01:43:48.950]  So we said, we'll protect everyone, we'll protect
[01:43:49.110 --> 01:43:51.371]  Shapiro, Crowder, you, everyone.
[01:43:51.511 --> 01:43:53.693]  And we won't start fights, but we'll finish them.
[01:43:54.413 --> 01:43:55.834]  And the New York Times doesn't like that.
[01:43:56.314 --> 01:44:00.416]  And so this journalist did this hit and said we're a white pride group, blah, blah, blah.
[01:44:00.456 --> 01:44:06.179]  Well, now you're criticizing, you know, animations of demons murdering small children, I mean, and raping them to death.
[01:44:06.199 --> 01:44:06.940]  How dare you be?
[01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:10.342]  So you're now a child porn phobe?
[01:44:11.226 --> 01:44:13.827]  Yes, I certainly am a proud child.
[01:44:13.887 --> 01:44:15.067]  I'm a proud pedophobe.
[01:44:15.647 --> 01:44:20.869]  But the interesting thing about this guy is they sit and they have beers with you, these journalists, and they try to, you know, be your friend.
[01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:22.369]  And they can't hold their liquor.
[01:44:22.729 --> 01:44:27.971]  And so this guy was drinking and he confessed that his wife, Alan Foyer is his name, New York Times writer.
[01:44:28.311 --> 01:44:34.512]  He confessed that his wife and their feminist dogma became such a burden that she gave up on kids.
[01:44:34.552 --> 01:44:35.513]  She became a workaholic.
[01:44:35.553 --> 01:44:36.453]  Her hair started falling out.
[01:44:36.753 --> 01:44:37.713]  Their marriage fell apart.
[01:44:38.093 --> 01:44:39.654]  And then he starts dating a teenager.
[01:44:40.074 --> 01:44:44.736]  This guy, he's dating, I think they've broken up now, but he leaves his wife for a 19-year-old.
[01:44:45.156 --> 01:44:50.018]  And I'm just looking at it and I'm thinking, you guys are ratso-rizzo from Midnight Cowboy.
[01:44:50.058 --> 01:44:58.642]  You guys are, are slimy, insidious, assiduous parasites that would throw away everything.
[01:44:58.662 --> 01:45:06.525]  I was about to say, the older and more manly you get, the more you are looking for, you know, the real meat on the bones, supercharged woman.
[01:45:08.346 --> 01:45:09.067]  But not leftists.
[01:45:09.407 --> 01:45:15.271]  They want, you know, 20, 30, 40 years younger than them so they can dominate and control and feel intellectual.
[01:45:15.772 --> 01:45:16.432]  They're slime.
[01:45:16.732 --> 01:45:17.313]  They're creeps.
[01:45:18.214 --> 01:45:20.776]  All these betas, they screw their interns.
[01:45:20.836 --> 01:45:22.357]  They're incurious.
[01:45:22.437 --> 01:45:23.358]  They're amoral.
[01:45:23.698 --> 01:45:24.879]  They're not good people.
[01:45:24.899 --> 01:45:30.643]  Like, every time you read an article, right, that says Nazi or something, take the name and go look up that person.
[01:45:30.663 --> 01:45:32.104]  And you'll find someone without kids.
[01:45:32.384 --> 01:45:33.746]  You'll find someone who's unmarried.
[01:45:33.946 --> 01:45:35.807]  You'll find a woman whose ovaries have dried up.
[01:45:35.907 --> 01:45:36.468]  And you realize,
[01:45:37.128 --> 01:45:39.331]  You didn't choose journalism because you're curious.
[01:45:39.771 --> 01:45:42.214]  You chose journalism for revenge.
[01:45:42.835 --> 01:45:50.684]  You are mad that your liberal dogma painted you into a corner of loneliness and being a dog mom, and you want to punish us.
[01:45:52.005 --> 01:45:57.670]  Megan Kelly was asking me, and they always ask me this, and John Ronson was texting me asking, like, you must not have had friends.
[01:45:57.711 --> 01:45:59.172]  You must be angry at the world.
[01:46:00.313 --> 01:46:01.855]  I said, no, no, you're projecting.
[01:46:02.115 --> 01:46:06.719]  I mean, I'm not bragging, but when I was in Dallas, I was the most popular person in the school, okay?
[01:46:06.939 --> 01:46:10.463]  When I moved down to Austin, I hung out with the most popular people, had the greatest time.
[01:46:10.723 --> 01:46:12.404]  My whole life's been nothing but total success.
[01:46:12.624 --> 01:46:13.565]  I've got four children.
[01:46:13.785 --> 01:46:14.726]  I'm super successful.
[01:46:14.926 --> 01:46:15.727]  I'm changing the world.
[01:46:15.927 --> 01:46:18.609]  And you look at my ancestors, it's basically all the same.
[01:46:18.829 --> 01:46:23.252]  Founding Texas, founding America, creating the stock exchange, dominating, doing everything.
[01:46:23.272 --> 01:46:31.579]  I mean, thank God for my genetics, but these people always think that I'm doing this because I'm not going to be overrun and controlled by a bunch of twisted filth!
[01:46:32.847 --> 01:46:35.908]  Hey, if you want to know who's corrupt, see who you can't criticize.
[01:46:36.268 --> 01:46:37.208]  We're open to debate.
[01:46:37.228 --> 01:46:38.028]  You have a problem with me?
[01:46:38.088 --> 01:46:39.049]  I'd love to discuss it.
[01:46:39.349 --> 01:46:40.549]  You have a problem with my beliefs?
[01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:41.509]  I'd love to hash them out.
[01:46:41.769 --> 01:46:46.891]  I think that we always do well because we're totally open and brave enough to confront everyone about everything.
[01:46:47.171 --> 01:46:54.833]  But they are communists, so they have to hide behind propaganda, hide behind fear, hide behind... It's not free speech, it's hate speech.
[01:46:54.853 --> 01:46:56.133]  We can't do this, we can't do that.
[01:46:56.453 --> 01:47:01.975]  You know, I've been talking to millennials a lot, because they come to my show, and the guys who wear MAGA hats will say,
[01:47:02.435 --> 01:47:05.476]  Inevitably, I'll meet a girl and she'll say, oh, you like Trump?
[01:47:05.496 --> 01:47:05.976]  Screw you.
[01:47:06.117 --> 01:47:09.578]  And then I'll get a call the next day saying, I can't stop thinking about you.
[01:47:10.118 --> 01:47:17.601]  And I think the moral of the story here is liberals, and especially feminists, don't want the utopia that they pretend they want.
[01:47:17.641 --> 01:47:18.842]  They know it's a dystopia.
[01:47:19.222 --> 01:47:21.523]  And ultimately, they want to be disciplined.
[01:47:21.883 --> 01:47:25.224]  They want someone who is confident and happy to hash it out.
[01:47:25.544 --> 01:47:27.345]  Because the first part of that is happy.
[01:47:27.985 --> 01:47:31.647]  And by the way, I'm not trying to brag and say I was the coolest guy in high school.
[01:47:32.512 --> 01:47:40.538]  I just thought back, then I wanted to get out of high school, I thought it was boring and stupid, and my friends were in college, because I thought the girls were better looking and the parties were better.
[01:47:40.739 --> 01:47:51.327]  It's not like I was trying to be cool, and I'm not bragging, it's just that I've got to let them know, I've always been successful, I've always been the alpha, I've always been winning, winning, winning, winning, winning.
[01:47:51.667 --> 01:47:52.908]  That's why I recognize Trump.
[01:47:53.168 --> 01:47:54.169]  He recognizes that.
[01:47:54.349 --> 01:47:55.650]  We want the Renaissance again.
[01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:57.151]  That's what the West is about.
[01:47:57.491 --> 01:48:05.396]  Not wanting to beat everybody else, so you can be better than them, but so we all just are awesome and all come together and absolutely have competition and go to the stars!
[01:48:06.530 --> 01:48:07.912]  Hey, we tried Revenge of the Nerds.
[01:48:08.332 --> 01:48:10.515]  We stopped wedging these guys for eight years.
[01:48:11.036 --> 01:48:11.877]  It didn't go well.
[01:48:12.438 --> 01:48:14.180]  I did this in high school, actually.
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:16.323]  We started our own thing, a bunch of punk rockers.
[01:48:16.864 --> 01:48:21.089]  And this nerd, who no one liked, we thought, you come into our gang.
[01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.450]  We want to
[01:48:21.690 --> 01:48:22.811]  We want to piss off the jocks.
[01:48:22.831 --> 01:48:23.932]  We want to think outside the box.
[01:48:24.412 --> 01:48:25.733]  And he drank his guts.
[01:48:26.173 --> 01:48:28.155]  He drank a whole bottle of vodka.
[01:48:28.375 --> 01:48:31.037]  I remember him screaming, Tammy Conkle, I love you!
[01:48:31.077 --> 01:48:32.338]  And then projectile vomiting.
[01:48:32.638 --> 01:48:34.820]  And I realized, we've made a mistake here.
[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:38.242]  We empowered someone who deserves a wedgie.
[01:48:38.522 --> 01:48:40.524]  And that's what all of journalism is today.
[01:48:40.884 --> 01:48:47.129]  It's bitter, angry nerds who should be hanging from a basketball hoop by the waistband of their underwear.
[01:48:47.731 --> 01:48:55.677]  Well, and I think that's an oversimplification, but it's definitely true that you get big groups of nerds together, whether they're yuppie nerds or trendy nerds.
[01:48:55.697 --> 01:48:59.860]  I mean, I think of a nerd, too, as a guy trying to be perfectly waspish and acting like he's somebody he isn't.
[01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:02.722]  Or a guy in a cowboy hat who's never been on a horse.
[01:49:02.742 --> 01:49:06.445]  You know, there's all these different forms of fakes and nerds that aren't real people.
[01:49:06.705 --> 01:49:08.666]  I mean, I don't even know if nerd's the word.
[01:49:08.827 --> 01:49:09.667]  What about poser?
[01:49:10.488 --> 01:49:10.948]  Pussies?
[01:49:11.228 --> 01:49:12.189]  Can we say pussies?
[01:49:12.509 --> 01:49:13.070]  Absolutely.
[01:49:13.854 --> 01:49:16.297]  Yeah, I think there are people... I noticed this with the Proud Boys.
[01:49:16.317 --> 01:49:18.740]  They go, yes, but you guys condone violence.
[01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:22.704]  And I said, well, yeah, we condone violence if we're getting attacked.
[01:49:23.185 --> 01:49:24.486]  I mean, what do you want us to do?
[01:49:24.586 --> 01:49:28.871]  Sit there and allow these Antifa lunatics to pepper spray us and not fight back?
[01:49:29.172 --> 01:49:33.597]  We just had that Australian Alex Jones get attacked by Antifa.
[01:49:33.877 --> 01:49:34.857]  And he beat them all up.
[01:49:35.377 --> 01:49:37.818]  And I think the left goes, well, why are you being violent?
[01:49:37.858 --> 01:49:40.358]  And you go, because they drew first blood.
[01:49:40.858 --> 01:49:42.899]  I don't pick fights, but I finish them.
[01:49:43.299 --> 01:49:48.220]  And I think that's totally foreign to a lot of the media class because they're wimps.
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:49.060]  Absolutely.
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:49.960]  I'm going to skip this, Bryce.
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:52.561]  We have more time with Gavin McGinnis to go to your phone calls and play clips.
[01:49:52.601 --> 01:49:54.321]  This is a very important clip.
[01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:57.422]  This is, again, where we have Comey.
[01:49:58.482 --> 01:50:05.035]  Coming out and admitting that the New York Times got it wrong in the main about the Russia story.
[01:50:05.055 --> 01:50:09.083]  So he's linking directly to them and the Washington Post, but saying then they got it wrong.
[01:50:09.123 --> 01:50:09.443]  Here it is.
[01:50:11.507 --> 01:50:23.656]  I remember you talked with us shortly after February 14th when the New York Times wrote an article that suggested that the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians.
[01:50:24.116 --> 01:50:26.238]  You remember reading that article when it first came out?
[01:50:26.358 --> 01:50:26.578]  I do.
[01:50:26.598 --> 01:50:29.941]  It was about allegedly extensive electronic surveillance.
[01:50:30.021 --> 01:50:31.282]  Correct.
[01:50:31.482 --> 01:50:38.547]  And that upset you to the point where you actually went out and surveyed the intelligence community to see whether you were missing something in that.
[01:50:38.607 --> 01:50:39.168]  Is that correct?
[01:50:40.202 --> 01:50:40.742]  That's correct.
[01:50:40.782 --> 01:50:42.363]  I want to be careful and open-sided.
[01:50:42.503 --> 01:50:45.084]  I'm not going to go any further than that, so thank you.
[01:50:46.485 --> 01:50:56.449]  In addition to that, after that, you sought out both Republican and Democrat senators to tell them that, hey, I don't know where this is coming from, but this is not factual.
[01:50:56.489 --> 01:50:57.169]  Do you recall that?
[01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.309]  Yes.
[01:51:02.894 --> 01:51:08.729]  So again, so the American people can understand this, that report by the New York Times was not true.
[01:51:08.749 --> 01:51:09.892]  Is that a fair statement?
[01:51:11.082 --> 01:51:12.203]  In the main, it was not true.
[01:51:12.223 --> 01:51:15.385]  And again, all of you know this, American people don't.
[01:51:16.385 --> 01:51:23.990]  The challenge, and I'm not picking on reporters about writing stories about classified information, is the people talking about it often don't really know what's going on.
[01:51:24.210 --> 01:51:26.431]  And those of us who actually know what's going on are not talking about it.
[01:51:27.032 --> 01:51:31.394]  And we don't call the press to say, hey, you got that thing wrong about this sensitive topic.
[01:51:31.715 --> 01:51:32.875]  We just have to leave it there.
[01:51:32.895 --> 01:51:38.459]  I mentioned to the chairman the nonsense around what influenced me to make the July 5th statement.
[01:51:39.059 --> 01:51:41.820]  Nonsense, but I can't go explaining how it's nonsense.
[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:53.004]  No, you just put out memos and leak stuff against the president, and then know full well they're going to twist it and lie about it, and then claim, oh sorry, jeepers creepers, Gavin McGinnis.
[01:51:54.185 --> 01:51:59.927]  It's strange that he's sitting there saying, I can't talk to the press, right after he admitted that he's the leak.
[01:52:01.505 --> 01:52:07.518]  It's a cognitive dissonance going on there that I don't think he realizes how badly he's incriminated himself.
[01:52:07.898 --> 01:52:08.760]  Is he at this hearing?
[01:52:11.118 --> 01:52:11.919]  That's a good way to put it.
[01:52:12.299 --> 01:52:13.140]  He's hung himself.
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:14.081]  Was he at the hearing?
[01:52:14.341 --> 01:52:19.185]  He's just flip-flopping, incriminating, perjuring because he's been to all these different hearings.
[01:52:19.205 --> 01:52:19.985]  I mean, he is lying.
[01:52:20.206 --> 01:52:22.427]  We don't know about what, but he's 180ing.
[01:52:22.688 --> 01:52:25.050]  In fact, since you mentioned it, a lot of people probably just tuned in.
[01:52:25.290 --> 01:52:29.073]  They're like, oh, I've heard of Alex Jones before because we're on over 200 stations around the country.
[01:52:29.333 --> 01:52:30.574]  That's the guy that's fake news.
[01:52:30.594 --> 01:52:34.177]  You know, he says that Trump was going to win the election and that the polls were fake.
[01:52:34.197 --> 01:52:35.518]  And of course, oh, he was proven right.
[01:52:36.039 --> 01:52:39.702]  But just in case they just tuned in, because the mainstream media probably won't tell him this.
[01:52:40.925 --> 01:52:42.087]  At least until we force him to.
[01:52:42.107 --> 01:52:43.870]  Oh, guess what?
[01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:48.236]  He said today that that's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:48.256 --> 01:52:49.018]  Well, let's just play the clip.
[01:52:50.623 --> 01:52:54.965]  The president tweeted on Friday, after I got fired, that I better hope there's not tapes.
[01:52:55.666 --> 01:53:02.370]  I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night, because it didn't dawn on me originally, that there might be corroboration for our conversation.
[01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:03.270]  There might be a tape.
[01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:06.972]  And my judgment was, I needed to get that out into the public square.
[01:53:07.052 --> 01:53:11.915]  And so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.
[01:53:11.935 --> 01:53:13.856]  Didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons.
[01:53:13.976 --> 01:53:17.978]  I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.
[01:53:18.358 --> 01:53:20.019]  And so I asked a close friend of mine to do it.
[01:53:20.199 --> 01:53:21.860]  And was that after the firing?
[01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:22.940]  No, no.
[01:53:23.621 --> 01:53:24.361]  Who was that?
[01:53:25.462 --> 01:53:27.823]  A good friend of mine who's a professor at Columbia Law School.
[01:53:39.025 --> 01:53:47.431]  Trump comes out and says, I did not ask him to stop the investigation, but I have said it's a bunch of bull, and that Flynn's a good guy.
[01:53:47.892 --> 01:53:49.753]  Like I've said in press conferences, he should be left alone.
[01:53:50.013 --> 01:53:51.814]  But that's my opinion, I didn't order him to.
[01:53:52.435 --> 01:53:55.737]  And of course, then he goes, oh, I need corroboration, because of what Trump was saying.
[01:53:55.978 --> 01:54:01.522]  He runs out, puts out the memo, so they can then lie about it, and then plays dumb when it's an illegal leak.
[01:54:01.882 --> 01:54:04.264]  Gavin, I, why is he so confident?
[01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:07.186]  I mean, like I said, is he at the same hearing that we're watching?
[01:54:08.677 --> 01:54:11.258]  It's bizarre, and I think CNN has realized it.
[01:54:11.599 --> 01:54:27.527]  I mean, CNN had a big ticking clock on their desk at a show yesterday, and once they realized that he's not going to be the smoking gun they thought he would, they removed the clock from the desk because they're cutting their losses right now.
[01:54:27.587 --> 01:54:31.970]  They're throwing the dead weight off of the airplane to go a little farther.
[01:54:32.290 --> 01:54:32.670]  I don't know.
[01:54:53.445 --> 01:54:55.888]  And they're very disgusting about it too.
[01:54:55.908 --> 01:55:00.573]  I won't get into the details, but the way they talk about Trump and Putin makes hentai porn look friendly.
[01:55:01.054 --> 01:55:03.717]  And you go, what's the evidence here?
[01:55:03.857 --> 01:55:04.358]  What's going on?
[01:55:04.398 --> 01:55:08.102]  And again, if it was Obama's administration or the Clinton administration,
[01:55:08.442 --> 01:55:09.824]  They would have just made it go away.
[01:55:10.164 --> 01:55:12.486]  They would have cancelled the investigation, that would have been the end of that.
[01:55:12.787 --> 01:55:14.669]  And we've become numb to corruption.
[01:55:14.989 --> 01:55:22.337]  So when someone allows an investigation to continue, and says, I hope you'd stop, but don't, we don't have a file in our brain for it.
[01:55:22.477 --> 01:55:24.299]  Because we're not used to this kind of transparency.
[01:55:24.319 --> 01:55:24.900]  And let's expand!
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:32.384]  They thought then they would claim he's corrupt because he's not, but now they're engaged in corruption trying to get him, so they're being hoisted on their own petard as they say.
[01:55:32.404 --> 01:55:35.666]  I want to go to some phone calls right now with Gavin McGinnis in the closing minutes.
[01:55:35.706 --> 01:55:36.226]  He's got to go.
[01:55:36.246 --> 01:55:36.926]  He's got his own show, too.
[01:55:36.946 --> 01:55:38.507]  We'll talk to you in five more minutes.
[01:55:38.527 --> 01:55:40.448]  In the next hour, I'll get a few more in.
[01:55:40.508 --> 01:55:42.949]  But again, we're not like the globalists left.
[01:55:43.049 --> 01:55:45.591]  We don't just say this was a train wreck to say it.
[01:55:46.772 --> 01:55:50.879]  I mean, this was a spectacular Death Star blowing up moment.
[01:55:50.939 --> 01:55:52.082]  These two and a half hours.
[01:55:52.462 --> 01:55:53.624]  We're going over more clips.
[01:55:53.644 --> 01:55:55.848]  This is the most incredible stuff I've ever seen, Gavin.
[01:55:56.892 --> 01:56:01.916]  Well, I feel like it's sort of like the left, they keep digging their own grave.
[01:56:01.936 --> 01:56:06.339]  There was a lesbian bookstore in Canada that said, we need laws against pornography.
[01:56:06.659 --> 01:56:08.481]  It's sexist, it's disgusting, it's horrible.
[01:56:08.761 --> 01:56:10.242]  And they changed the laws in Canada.
[01:56:10.562 --> 01:56:18.428]  The next thing you know, this lesbian bookstore can't import any of their content because they screwed themselves with their own parameters.
[01:56:18.769 --> 01:56:21.351]  And the left does this to themselves again and again.
[01:56:21.391 --> 01:56:22.532]  They're their own worst enemy.
[01:56:22.792 --> 01:56:25.093]  They demand transparency, they demand meritocracy.
[01:56:25.874 --> 01:56:29.357]  Obama says keep bombing gay nightclubs and, you know, teenybopper deals.
[01:56:29.557 --> 01:56:31.478]  And I say, why is the left bringing people in that kill them?
[01:56:31.699 --> 01:56:34.160]  Then the media says, I say the girls deserve to die.
[01:56:34.381 --> 01:56:37.483]  No, I said, why'd your parents bring in the Muslims that killed them?
[01:56:37.803 --> 01:56:38.764]  I didn't kill the girls.
[01:56:39.024 --> 01:56:40.145]  Megyn Kelly asked me that.
[01:56:40.205 --> 01:56:44.028]  Like, I killed the girls, you know, up there at the Manchester deal.
[01:56:44.248 --> 01:56:45.189]  Let's go to a phone call.
[01:56:45.249 --> 01:56:47.731]  Will, Jason, Stephen, Cole, Chris, and others.
[01:56:48.031 --> 01:56:50.433]  Then we got Roger Stone popping in with breaking news and more.
[01:56:51.194 --> 01:56:52.314]  Who's up first here?
[01:56:52.354 --> 01:56:54.036]  Let's go ahead and go to Will in Florida.
[01:56:54.076 --> 01:56:55.277]  Will, you're on the air with Gavin McGinnis.
[01:56:57.935 --> 01:56:59.176]  Hey, good afternoon, guys.
[01:56:59.196 --> 01:57:01.679]  Pretty interesting discussion you guys got going.
[01:57:02.239 --> 01:57:06.443]  I got a question for Gavin, and it basically has to do with Trump.
[01:57:07.624 --> 01:57:12.048]  First, just to say really quickly, the Comey thing, I know that's going to be the talk of the town.
[01:57:12.128 --> 01:57:13.530]  I'm glad it came out how it did.
[01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:20.376]  But Gavin, would you be interested in meeting up at the White House with a bunch of like-minded people?
[01:57:20.396 --> 01:57:23.179]  Because I remember when Ron Paul was on, I was just thinking,
[01:57:23.641 --> 01:57:26.162]  Why Ron Paul doesn't deserve to get in the White House?
[01:57:26.202 --> 01:57:28.903]  Why Ron Paul doesn't deserve to be in the Oval Office?
[01:57:29.423 --> 01:57:32.864]  And instead of being like a bad Bilderberg, he'll be like a good Bilderberg.
[01:57:33.004 --> 01:57:34.604]  Would you be interested in going to that?
[01:57:35.124 --> 01:57:35.584]  Absolutely.
[01:57:35.624 --> 01:57:36.205]  What about you, Gavin?
[01:57:36.845 --> 01:57:37.325]  Of course!
[01:57:37.525 --> 01:57:39.205]  I'm kind of pissed off I've never met him.
[01:57:39.465 --> 01:57:40.206]  I feel ripped off.
[01:57:40.266 --> 01:57:43.947]  Everyone thinks that Trump sends us secret paychecks and all that stuff.
[01:57:44.267 --> 01:57:50.068]  If I have to deal with the stigma of that lie, I should get at least one beer with the guy.
[01:57:50.289 --> 01:57:51.529]  I feel I've been gypped.
[01:57:52.637 --> 01:57:53.578]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[01:57:54.999 --> 01:58:01.544]  The president's so busy and fighting and winning so good that even though... I'm gonna give the press something here.
[01:58:01.564 --> 01:58:03.546]  I've been invited and could have gone on that with the president.
[01:58:04.106 --> 01:58:05.307]  I was like, sir, you're too busy.
[01:58:05.367 --> 01:58:06.168]  You don't worry about that.
[01:58:06.388 --> 01:58:07.809]  This is our battle for all of us.
[01:58:08.049 --> 01:58:09.851]  This is defeating the globalists for our children.
[01:58:10.111 --> 01:58:12.573]  It isn't about being celebrities and hanging out with Trump.
[01:58:12.613 --> 01:58:13.694]  But I get your point, Gavin.
[01:58:13.974 --> 01:58:15.735]  I mean, obviously, it'd be great.
[01:58:16.636 --> 01:58:18.236]  We're winning the culture war.
[01:58:18.516 --> 01:58:20.117]  We're getting our taxes cut, hopefully.
[01:58:20.317 --> 01:58:21.377]  We're securing our borders.
[01:58:21.417 --> 01:58:22.597]  We're bringing back sovereignty.
[01:58:23.017 --> 01:58:24.358]  We're staying at political correctness.
[01:58:24.418 --> 01:58:25.338]  That's the win.
[01:58:25.698 --> 01:58:26.698]  That's what it's all about.
[01:58:27.018 --> 01:58:28.839]  Gavin, I know you probably gotta go, but do five more with us.
[01:58:29.079 --> 01:58:31.479]  Give us your take on that and a few more calls straight ahead.
[01:58:31.539 --> 01:58:32.039]  Thank you, Will.
[01:58:32.079 --> 01:58:32.800]  Great questions.
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:33.300]  Stay with us.
[01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:34.620]  I am fired up!
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:36.280]  Comey just blew up!
[01:58:36.701 --> 01:58:38.621]  Comey just melted like the Wicked Witch!
[01:58:39.281 --> 01:58:40.361]  He just hung himself.
[01:58:40.401 --> 01:58:41.522]  He just disintegrated.
[01:58:41.722 --> 01:58:43.102]  He just wrote down the bomb!
[01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:47.051]  Here's something you won't hear on the fake news.
[01:58:47.251 --> 01:58:53.013]  According to the Daily Caller, Trump's approval rating is actually higher than Bill Clinton's was at the same point in his presidency.
[01:58:53.073 --> 01:59:02.216]  That's despite all the negative media attention, the wild goose hunt over bogus charges of Russia's involvement in the election, and the unending chorus of anti-Trump talking heads on network news.
[01:59:02.556 --> 01:59:07.398]  Even the liberal rag Newsweek magazine had to admit Trump's approval rating was better than Bill Clinton's at 160 days in.
[01:59:08.618 --> 01:59:16.025]  While Trump's approval rating is only hovering around the 40% mark, he's still doing better than Clinton, who only had 37% approval at 138 days in.
[01:59:16.326 --> 01:59:21.291]  Of course, Trump's disapproval rating is also higher than Clinton's, at 57%, compared to Clinton's 49%.
[01:59:22.312 --> 01:59:23.133]  But what do you expect?
[01:59:23.333 --> 01:59:27.397]  Bill Clinton was lauded as the poster boy of everything cool about modern liberalism.
[01:59:27.557 --> 01:59:32.939]  Meanwhile, Trump and his family have been put under a microscope and have been under constant assault even before he got elected.
[01:59:33.099 --> 01:59:39.521]  Despite all the negativity, Trump's numbers continue to climb, which is proof that the fake media's narrative is dying.
[01:59:39.781 --> 01:59:42.502]  Reporting for InfoWars.com, I'm Jay Michaels.
[01:59:45.723 --> 01:59:51.585]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.689 --> 02:00:17.871]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:18.372 --> 02:00:23.497]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:38.125]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you just joined us, CNN has had to admit that it reported massive amounts of fake news surrounding Comey.
[02:00:38.886 --> 02:00:40.927]  They even had the headline, sorry, we're fake news.
[02:00:41.548 --> 02:00:44.510]  Because they just ran with all these lies that just got abolished.
[02:00:45.231 --> 02:00:49.254]  To CNN's credit, most of the other fake news isn't even reporting on that right now.
[02:00:49.314 --> 02:00:53.297]  Gavin McGinnis, where do you... This is such a huge explosion, or implosion.
[02:00:53.677 --> 02:00:55.199]  I don't know how they can cover this up.
[02:00:55.879 --> 02:00:58.660]  I guess if they try, it'll be even more spectacular.
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:02.280]  This is as bad as them saying Hillary was ahead in all those rigged polls.
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:05.221]  It really is a total catastrophe for the left.
[02:01:05.541 --> 02:01:10.422]  And isn't it amazing, by the way, that the New York Times was able to destroy that brand?
[02:01:11.002 --> 02:01:14.342]  I mean, Times Square is named after the New York Times.
[02:01:14.462 --> 02:01:17.723]  It's been the paper of record for generations.
[02:01:18.083 --> 02:01:22.984]  And then Pinch comes along, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., runs it into the ground.
[02:01:23.464 --> 02:01:28.588]  With his obsession with, I don't know, multiculturalism and different restaurants and his hatred of the family.
[02:01:28.628 --> 02:01:31.009]  I don't really know what his total agenda is.
[02:01:31.289 --> 02:01:35.332]  And then he has to send it, sell it to a Mexican billionaire.
[02:01:35.752 --> 02:01:38.794]  And the next thing you know, they have a bunch of bloggers running the show.
[02:01:39.135 --> 02:01:42.477]  Did you know they call President Trump Mr. Trump in their articles?
[02:01:42.817 --> 02:01:47.220]  Not in op-ed, but in normal articles, he's referred to as Mr. Trump.
[02:01:47.781 --> 02:01:52.424]  Have you also noticed when you're typing on the computer, Trump isn't capitalized in the spellcheck?
[02:01:53.690 --> 02:01:54.690]  No, I haven't seen that.
[02:01:55.630 --> 02:01:56.511]  At least on iPhones.
[02:01:56.571 --> 02:01:57.211]  I mean, you're right.
[02:01:57.411 --> 02:01:58.651]  They don't even call him the president.
[02:01:58.971 --> 02:02:00.412]  And again, it isn't about worshipping Trump.
[02:02:00.712 --> 02:02:05.673]  It's so good to see a blue-collar billionaire literally not care what they do and to see them folding.
[02:02:06.613 --> 02:02:08.153]  Yes, and they go, get him off Twitter.
[02:02:08.393 --> 02:02:09.634]  We want to control the narrative.
[02:02:10.014 --> 02:02:10.714]  No, no, no, no.
[02:02:10.734 --> 02:02:11.834]  And look how arrogant they are.
[02:02:11.894 --> 02:02:12.594]  Get off Twitter!
[02:02:12.654 --> 02:02:13.394]  Get off Twitter!
[02:02:13.454 --> 02:02:14.175]  Get off Twitter!
[02:02:14.235 --> 02:02:14.935]  Get off Twitter!
[02:02:15.015 --> 02:02:15.675]  What is that?
[02:02:16.815 --> 02:02:17.156]  It is.
[02:02:17.436 --> 02:02:18.417]  I want to control the narrative.
[02:02:18.437 --> 02:02:23.324]  Remember with the Wikileaks, we had Cuomo over at, what was it, MSNBC?
[02:02:23.384 --> 02:02:23.845]  CNN.
[02:02:23.865 --> 02:02:25.947]  He said, we're only allowed to read it, you can't.
[02:02:26.628 --> 02:02:27.570]  I'll control this.
[02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:29.873]  And we're seeing this with the statues in New Orleans.
[02:02:30.253 --> 02:02:32.817]  I'll take down the statues and I'll put them in this museum.
[02:02:33.277 --> 02:02:33.737]  Over here.
[02:02:34.077 --> 02:02:35.978]  And then I'll tell you what the statues mean.
[02:02:36.218 --> 02:02:37.799]  It's all about controlling the narrative.
[02:02:37.819 --> 02:02:38.939]  It's all about power.
[02:02:39.239 --> 02:02:44.241]  And the funny thing about us is they call us fascists, but we are about the least power possible.
[02:02:44.461 --> 02:02:45.902]  We want to dismantle the government.
[02:02:46.122 --> 02:02:48.403]  We want everyone to control their own narrative.
[02:02:48.703 --> 02:02:49.863]  And that is seen as fascism.
[02:02:49.883 --> 02:02:50.143]  Well, sure.
[02:02:50.203 --> 02:02:52.524]  I mean, first it's, say, gay, not homosexual.
[02:02:52.724 --> 02:02:54.125]  Then it's, let me take down this statue.
[02:02:54.345 --> 02:02:55.885]  Then it's, don't use the word mother or father.
[02:02:55.925 --> 02:02:57.466]  They want to control language.
[02:02:58.393 --> 02:03:04.074]  Yeah, I heard Reza Aslan call the founding fathers our foreparents.
[02:03:04.614 --> 02:03:05.995]  You can't say fathers now.
[02:03:06.335 --> 02:03:08.115]  And that's why Trump was elected.
[02:03:08.375 --> 02:03:10.236]  Because someone said, stop saying anchor baby.
[02:03:10.876 --> 02:03:13.296]  They gave a long, involved definition of what it should be.
[02:03:13.596 --> 02:03:15.817]  Children of undocumented peoples or whatever.
[02:03:16.057 --> 02:03:17.797]  And he goes, nah, I'm going to say anchor baby.
[02:03:18.098 --> 02:03:20.778]  And I think America is saying, nah, I'm done listening to you.
[02:03:21.058 --> 02:03:22.158]  I'm done listening to the wimps.
[02:03:22.479 --> 02:03:23.599]  I'm done not wedging you.
[02:03:23.839 --> 02:03:24.499]  We're in control now.
[02:03:24.679 --> 02:03:27.084]  One more quick call and I'll come back to the rest of you, but Gavin's got to go.
[02:03:27.184 --> 02:03:29.388]  Jason in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[02:03:29.568 --> 02:03:29.869]  Welcome.
[02:03:31.973 --> 02:03:32.934]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:03:33.315 --> 02:03:34.457]  I'm doing real good.
[02:03:34.477 --> 02:03:36.822]  I mean, boy, they're not going to put this toothpaste back in the tube.
[02:03:39.870 --> 02:03:55.521]  Well, you know, I've been listening since 2003, kind of took a break for a long while during the Obama administration, basically learning, reading up as much as I can about history just to get myself aware, because I felt like such an idiot back then for not knowing anything.
[02:03:55.961 --> 02:03:57.863]  But anyway, getting back to Comey.
[02:03:58.423 --> 02:04:03.927]  So my analysis, it's looking like Comey is probably going to take the fall for this.
[02:04:04.307 --> 02:04:05.508]  He's going to perjure himself.
[02:04:06.354 --> 02:04:09.737]  He's going to get that all to put the case against Trump.
[02:04:10.278 --> 02:04:11.419]  They want to make him a patsy.
[02:04:11.459 --> 02:04:16.904]  They would say that Comey had to leak to the press to get the special counsel, prosecutor, whatever.
[02:04:16.924 --> 02:04:19.186]  I'll tell you what, I'm going to come back to you.
[02:04:19.206 --> 02:04:20.087]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:04:20.107 --> 02:04:22.429]  I'm going to come back to you, Jason, real quick.
[02:04:22.449 --> 02:04:24.230]  Just go on hold so Gavin can have a comment.
[02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:28.574]  I think that is what they're kind of setting up with him saying, I had to do bad things to get the special prosecutor.
[02:04:28.594 --> 02:04:29.015]  What do you think?
[02:04:30.450 --> 02:04:31.291]  Does Comey know?
[02:04:31.511 --> 02:04:33.612]  Does he understand what's happening to him right now?
[02:04:33.713 --> 02:04:35.934]  Is he aware of his surroundings?
[02:04:36.274 --> 02:04:41.518]  Calling yourself the leak, saying that you lied, pretending that hope was a command to stop.
[02:04:41.999 --> 02:04:43.940]  These are all huge deals, my friend.
[02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:45.281]  You're in big trouble.
[02:04:45.401 --> 02:04:46.342]  Does he notice this?
[02:04:47.122 --> 02:04:49.484]  Alright, Gavin McGinnis, you're on fire and so are we.
[02:04:49.564 --> 02:04:50.985]  We'll be back with Roger Stone.
[02:04:51.005 --> 02:04:52.606]  Your calls, David Knight and more.
[02:04:52.646 --> 02:04:53.187]  Stay with us.
[02:04:58.693 --> 02:05:04.256]  Does your shampoo leave your scalp itchy and your hair dry and frizzy?

[02:06:48.814 --> 02:06:57.097]  Well, I gotta tell you, Millie Weaver and her great accomplice in patriotic crime against the New World Order, Gavin, aren't just amazing researchers and reporters.
[02:06:57.557 --> 02:07:00.258]  They're also really, really good at shooting commercials.
[02:07:00.698 --> 02:07:09.842]  I mean, that thing looks like some million-dollar Hollywood commercial, and they shot that right here in Austin, Texas, to support the broadcast, without me even asking them to do it.
[02:07:10.302 --> 02:07:16.387]  And that's because Millie is really into high quality organic shampoo, body wash, things like that.
[02:07:16.888 --> 02:07:19.750]  And she tried Emmerich's Essentials and just thought that it was amazing.
[02:07:20.050 --> 02:07:23.033]  So she had the idea with Gavin to produce the ad you just saw.
[02:07:23.113 --> 02:07:27.096]  But believe me, the product is just as good as the cover.
[02:07:27.556 --> 02:07:32.641]  You'll find Emmerich's Essentials at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:07:35.703 --> 02:07:39.104]  And again, I'd like to thank the listeners and the viewers for their ongoing support.
[02:07:39.344 --> 02:07:40.845]  Without you, there would be no InfoWar.
[02:07:41.205 --> 02:07:44.086]  And I'd like to thank Millie and Gavin for really going the extra mile.
[02:07:44.106 --> 02:07:47.667]  I think this is one of the best commercials I've ever seen, and I'm really proud that it's ours.
[02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:53.429]  So again, folks, find out why Emirates Essentials has so many people really giving it five-star reviews.
[02:08:08.502 --> 02:08:09.883]  A dark day for Comey.
[02:08:10.083 --> 02:08:12.245]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:12.345 --> 02:08:12.766]  A dark day.
[02:08:12.786 --> 02:08:18.030]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:08:19.251 --> 02:08:20.992]  Yes, the truth has come for them.
[02:08:21.092 --> 02:08:25.776]  You dig a hole for your brother to fall in it, you fall in it.
[02:08:26.076 --> 02:08:26.677]  That's biblical.
[02:08:28.174 --> 02:08:34.976]  Trump's open approach to not engaging in chicanery, not doing illegal things, and to just being open is devastating them.
[02:08:35.016 --> 02:08:48.460]  And now we have Comey, if you just joined us, these clips are coming up, admitting he was the leaker of the memo, and then let them put out lies about the memo, and then laughs about it, saying it's not his fault, because it's classified.
[02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:49.721]  But he was scared.
[02:08:50.021 --> 02:08:50.861]  He was cowardly.
[02:08:50.901 --> 02:08:51.461]  He was weak.
[02:08:51.561 --> 02:08:52.362]  These are his quotes.
[02:08:54.222 --> 02:08:55.663]  Weak, cowardly, afraid.
[02:08:55.703 --> 02:08:56.323]  Those are quotes.
[02:08:57.659 --> 02:09:01.543]  To tell the Attorney General about it so he had a memo he sat on illegally.
[02:09:01.963 --> 02:09:02.624]  That's a crime.
[02:09:03.885 --> 02:09:07.068]  Now we've got Congressional testimony that contradicts his memo.
[02:09:07.809 --> 02:09:10.972]  And his newest testimony that contradicts it.
[02:09:11.112 --> 02:09:12.274]  He's lying!
[02:09:12.534 --> 02:09:13.595]  He's perjured himself.
[02:09:13.655 --> 02:09:19.040]  Those headlines with the video clips for you, my beautiful info warriors.
[02:09:20.037 --> 02:09:22.999]  Of every race, color, and creed, there is only one race, humanity.
[02:09:23.399 --> 02:09:26.542]  You can access InfoWars.com right now.
[02:09:27.442 --> 02:09:30.164]  We have the perjury article with the videos.
[02:09:30.585 --> 02:09:37.290]  We have the admissions that Trump never ordered him to stop the investigation, totally destroying MSM.
[02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:40.753]  We have him admitting that he's the leaker committing the crime.
[02:09:40.933 --> 02:09:43.536]  I mean, this is delicious!
[02:09:44.117 --> 02:09:51.365]  And we have the articles on Infowars.com with the video of him admitting Loretta Lynch asked him to not call it an investigation.
[02:09:52.326 --> 02:09:56.071]  That is the essence of obstruction of justice.
[02:09:56.131 --> 02:09:57.052]  The higher up!
[02:09:58.556 --> 02:10:02.078]  Going into an investigation and saying, shut it down, basically.
[02:10:02.439 --> 02:10:10.744]  We need to create a master article, maybe Paul Watson can do it or anybody else, that just says, 10 facts that destroy Comey, the Democrats, and the Russia investigation.
[02:10:11.144 --> 02:10:13.506]  Or the crimes that the testimony shows.
[02:10:13.606 --> 02:10:18.529]  I mean, this is unbelievable, total and complete reversal.
[02:10:19.770 --> 02:10:21.011]  Now, I follow my intellectual gut.
[02:10:22.847 --> 02:10:32.114]  And I follow my own research, and I follow my sources, and I told you on election night, the big battle was coming, and that things were going to be tougher than even the election.
[02:10:32.314 --> 02:10:36.217]  And I told Roger Stone, when he was sitting right there beside me, we were drinking champagne.
[02:10:37.779 --> 02:10:41.461]  I was shaken by it, and I went and did hours more live drudge linked to it.
[02:10:41.782 --> 02:10:43.283]  I went live at like 4.30 in the morning.
[02:10:44.644 --> 02:10:46.906]  Gotta pull that speech up I gave there, that was powerful.
[02:10:47.166 --> 02:10:49.828]  I'm not bragging, sometimes the show's unlistenable, but I know it was powerful.
[02:10:52.907 --> 02:10:58.629]  And I said to Stone about two weeks ago on the phone, and I said it on air, you all heard it, I said, Trump has totally turned the corner.
[02:11:00.129 --> 02:11:05.030]  It looks like he's going down because they're freaking out, they're throwing everything they've got, they're lying.
[02:11:05.391 --> 02:11:06.691]  This stuff's all lies.
[02:11:07.151 --> 02:11:12.453]  And when I saw literally, literally more than 50 lies a day that would give me headaches, there was so much.
[02:11:12.473 --> 02:11:14.153]  I couldn't even chronicle it all.
[02:11:14.173 --> 02:11:15.533]  It was all cut and dry stuff.
[02:11:16.734 --> 02:11:17.374]  All cut and dry.
[02:11:19.261 --> 02:11:22.084]  He gave away the location of the secret submarines and it's like a Pentagon press release.
[02:11:22.244 --> 02:11:23.405]  There they are in Seoul, South Korea.
[02:11:23.706 --> 02:11:25.027]  You know, two weeks before.
[02:11:26.969 --> 02:11:33.996]  So going to our guest, Roger Stone, I can tell you now that Trump has massively turned the corner with the public.
[02:11:34.557 --> 02:11:35.878]  I knew the Hillary polls were fake.
[02:11:35.958 --> 02:11:36.719]  I had my sources.
[02:11:36.739 --> 02:11:37.600]  I know how they operate.
[02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:38.641]  I read the methodology.
[02:11:38.681 --> 02:11:39.942]  The polls that he's only at 48%, he's at 65.
[02:11:42.845 --> 02:11:45.046]  Only the weakest minded idiots now are for Trump.
[02:11:45.206 --> 02:11:52.569]  The stock market 3 trillion, the illegals down 43%, pulling out of the Paris carbon tax, the TPP.
[02:11:53.149 --> 02:11:54.269]  I mean, there's some bad stuff.
[02:11:54.289 --> 02:11:55.189]  He's got some bad people.
[02:11:55.230 --> 02:11:56.470]  He's gone sideways on some things.
[02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:58.931]  But with this Comey thing, this is like...
[02:11:59.949 --> 02:12:03.010]  This is like the Battle of the Bulge, where we defeated Hitler for sure.
[02:12:03.170 --> 02:12:07.190]  I mean, this is the deciding, or the battle of, you know, Leningrad or Stalingrad.
[02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:10.671]  I mean, this is unbelievable!
[02:12:11.031 --> 02:12:14.972]  Everybody knows, I will not celebrate unless it is a celebration!
[02:12:15.192 --> 02:12:20.913]  The media is going to try to spin this, but this is incredible!
[02:12:21.353 --> 02:12:25.534]  Man, this is like winning the election more... I mean, this is... Stone, am I wrong?
[02:12:25.554 --> 02:12:26.314]  I mean, how big is this?
[02:12:26.354 --> 02:12:27.974]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign.
[02:12:28.976 --> 02:12:31.517]  Well, Alex, I'm glad to see you're in a great mood.
[02:12:31.537 --> 02:12:33.178]  You have, I think, good reason to be.
[02:12:33.358 --> 02:12:38.160]  This testimony by Mr. Comey was a proverbial dud.
[02:12:39.181 --> 02:12:46.024]  First of all, I like the way he throws little country aphorisms in there like, Lordy, I hope there are tapes.
[02:12:46.164 --> 02:12:46.444]  Dude!
[02:12:47.091 --> 02:12:50.893]  You're an inside-the-beltway slick lawyer.
[02:12:50.953 --> 02:12:56.176]  You were paid $6 million to cover up the crimes of the defense contractor Lockheed.
[02:12:56.516 --> 02:12:58.557]  Stop acting like some country boy.
[02:12:58.937 --> 02:13:03.079]  You're as duplicitous and slippery and sophisticated as they come.
[02:13:04.119 --> 02:13:05.680]  But there's no beef there.
[02:13:06.100 --> 02:13:11.943]  He does not prove an obstruction case against the president, but he certainly infers heavily
[02:13:13.664 --> 02:13:21.771]  That Loretta Lynch, the Attorney General for Barack Obama, attempted to obstruct justice in the Hillary email matter.
[02:13:22.472 --> 02:13:39.967]  I was also, Alex, very disappointed that no Republican Senator asked him whether he concluded not to prosecute Hillary in the email matter on the basis of what we now know to be a counterfeit memo that showed collusion
[02:13:40.968 --> 02:13:44.589]  Between Loretta Lynch and an official in the Clinton campaign.
[02:13:45.249 --> 02:13:48.030]  It doesn't matter at this point whether the memo was real.
[02:13:48.370 --> 02:13:50.911]  What matters is what Mr. Comey believed.
[02:13:51.531 --> 02:13:55.193]  And according to the New York Times, he believed it was authentic.
[02:13:55.893 --> 02:13:59.134]  And therefore, rather than report it as an officer of the court,
[02:14:00.333 --> 02:14:02.074]  He furthered the obstruction.
[02:14:02.114 --> 02:14:03.574]  In fact, he facilitated it.
[02:14:03.634 --> 02:14:10.436]  Now, Roger, I want to walk through all that, because there's a lot of subtlety here, and that's what you're really good at, being in Washington for decades, to break this down, one of the top analysts out there.
[02:14:10.456 --> 02:14:15.798]  So I want to walk through that, and David Knight's coming, and we'll do that at the bottom of the hour, if you can do the rest of the hour with us today.
[02:14:16.158 --> 02:14:18.399]  And then we've got Anthony Acumia in the fourth hour.
[02:14:18.419 --> 02:14:22.040]  He's going to go over all the different clips of the testimony and take calls and things.
[02:14:22.820 --> 02:14:25.421]  Am I wrong, just at an intellectual and gut level,
[02:14:26.221 --> 02:14:27.201]  With what we just saw.
[02:14:27.301 --> 02:14:28.482]  Admitting he's the leaker.
[02:14:29.242 --> 02:14:31.543]  Admitting that the New York Times and others lied about what was in it.
[02:14:32.383 --> 02:14:34.884]  Admitting that most of the Russian thing is made up.
[02:14:35.184 --> 02:14:37.605]  Admitting that it was Loretta Lynch trying to influence him.
[02:14:38.085 --> 02:14:40.446]  I mean, to me, this is just bombshell.
[02:14:41.686 --> 02:14:52.990]  Well, the most significant thing from a personal point of view is that he debunked the New York Times reports of February 14th and later, and earlier, January 20th.
[02:14:54.091 --> 02:15:00.738]  That I was among those who had been in touch with the Russians and therefore had colluded with them.
[02:15:00.918 --> 02:15:10.067]  He admitted that this is entirely false, even though that story, those stories, were based on, quote, intelligence community sources.
[02:15:10.729 --> 02:15:19.671]  So, I think we wipe away the question of Russian collusion entirely with Mr. Comey's testimony.
[02:15:19.731 --> 02:15:20.532]  And let me stop you.
[02:15:20.552 --> 02:15:21.772]  That's why this is so big.
[02:15:21.852 --> 02:15:27.333]  It devastates the MSM that has been caught in literally hundreds of different facets lying.
[02:15:27.693 --> 02:15:29.574]  They're having to do retractions all over the place.
[02:15:30.214 --> 02:15:43.299]  Is this a bigger egg-on-the-face discrediting event than them lying about the outcome of the election and claiming Hillary was invincible and Newsweek already having, you know, hundreds of thousands of newspapers and magazines printed with Hillary, Madam President, on the cover?
[02:15:43.319 --> 02:15:46.660]  I mean, this is a Death Star blowing up event.
[02:15:47.420 --> 02:15:56.003]  Yeah, I actually think it is the end, it's the death whimper of the Russian collusion narrative that has been pushed so aggressively
[02:15:56.683 --> 02:16:18.416]  By the mainstream media, even though Democrats like Senator Dianne Feinstein, a ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and even the hapless boob Adam Schiff, the congressman from California, are forced to admit on the record they have no evidence whatsoever of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.
[02:16:18.476 --> 02:16:23.039]  The whole thing is a hoax, a fairy tale, a canard.
[02:16:24.039 --> 02:16:26.740]  And I think that is now openly exposed.
[02:16:26.881 --> 02:16:33.483]  So, as you predicted a month ago, I saw a bunch of reports this morning and last night, he's mentally ill, he has Alzheimer's, he's insane.
[02:16:33.543 --> 02:16:39.646]  Instead of, he works 18 hours a day, he climbs up hills, you know, like a 15-year-old can't do it, he's playing golf.
[02:16:39.926 --> 02:16:41.007]  How does he have such a great memory?
[02:16:41.047 --> 02:16:42.467]  Why has he got such great stamina?
[02:16:42.687 --> 02:16:43.808]  You know, what's the secret of Trump?
[02:16:44.088 --> 02:16:47.850]  Instead, he's a doddering 99-year-old who doesn't even know what his name is.
[02:16:48.800 --> 02:17:06.803]  Yeah, they have to now quickly shift the narrative because we already have these July protests, really an excuse for violence, paid for violence, brought to you by our friend George Soros, and our rationale was supposed to be that we have to remove Trump because he colluded with the Russians.
[02:17:07.463 --> 02:17:15.949]  Now that that has collapsed, the new narrative is he's mentally ill, he's slipping, he has Alzheimer's, he's too old.
[02:17:15.969 --> 02:17:18.630]  Of course, there's no evidence of any of that either.
[02:17:18.710 --> 02:17:24.154]  That's a falsehood, a fairy tale being put forward by the exact same people.
[02:17:24.214 --> 02:17:26.395]  No, I think Mr. Comey took a beating today.
[02:17:27.056 --> 02:17:31.579]  And interestingly, Alex, he shed the spotlight back on Loretta Lynch.
[02:17:32.339 --> 02:17:33.760]  In the Obama administration.
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:38.681]  And since you raised that, let's go to Loretta Lynch first, then I've got him admitting he leaked to the press, which is clearly illegal.
[02:17:38.701 --> 02:17:41.182]  We're going to take your phone calls in the next segment and look at all that.
[02:17:41.242 --> 02:17:48.944]  Roger Stone, who very soon, we're getting all the equipment set up, the studio's built, will be hosting a night-time transmission here.
[02:17:48.964 --> 02:17:52.346]  We've got to get the contract signed and do all that, but I'll just tell you, it's a done deal.
[02:17:52.366 --> 02:17:53.366]  We've already made that agreement.
[02:17:54.046 --> 02:17:58.210]  And we got a lot of other stuff in the pipe here, so thank you all for your prayers and support.
[02:17:58.790 --> 02:18:01.472]  The globalists know about it, by the way, and they are really pissed off, too.
[02:18:01.573 --> 02:18:04.955]  So please pray for us and financially support us, because they can already see what we've done.
[02:18:04.975 --> 02:18:06.377]  They're really afraid of what we're about to do.
[02:18:07.177 --> 02:18:11.441]  But let's go ahead and go to that clip of him on the former Attorney General.
[02:18:12.517 --> 02:18:24.583]  Probably the only other consideration, I guess I can talk about an open setting, is at one point the Attorney General had directed me not to call it an investigation, but instead to call it a matter, which confused me and concerned me.
[02:18:24.983 --> 02:18:32.167]  But that was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the department if we're to close this case credibly.
[02:18:32.887 --> 02:18:34.768]  So that's way beyond what they claim even Trump did.
[02:18:34.808 --> 02:18:37.870]  Now let's go to past info to friends in the press.
[02:18:38.922 --> 02:18:49.555]  Which is, again, he didn't give it to the Attorney General, he sat on it, he was troubled by it, but he admits it's not an order, it was a, oh I hope, and then he leaks it to the press so they can then misrepresent what's in it.
[02:18:49.635 --> 02:18:49.976]  Here it is.
[02:18:51.544 --> 02:18:55.885]  The president tweeted on Friday, after I got fired, that I better hope there's not tapes.
[02:18:56.585 --> 02:19:03.266]  I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night, because it didn't dawn on me originally, that there might be corroboration for our conversation.
[02:19:03.286 --> 02:19:04.166]  There might be a tape.
[02:19:04.686 --> 02:19:07.867]  And my judgment was, I needed to get that out into the public square.
[02:19:07.967 --> 02:19:12.808]  And so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.
[02:19:12.828 --> 02:19:18.889]  Didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.
[02:19:19.269 --> 02:19:20.929]  And so I asked a close friend of mine to do it.
[02:19:21.109 --> 02:19:22.734]  And was stabbed after the firing.
[02:19:28.706 --> 02:19:29.926]  He got bluffed.
[02:19:30.306 --> 02:19:33.227]  Trump does have tapes, obviously, but by, oh really, I've got tapes.
[02:19:33.487 --> 02:19:39.008]  When Comey was trying to lie through surrogates and say there was more, Trump was, oh really, I got tapes.
[02:19:39.288 --> 02:19:40.269]  Well, you better hope I don't have tapes.
[02:19:40.589 --> 02:19:45.510]  So then he gets bluffed into bringing out his little hidden memo that he kept from the Justice Department illegally.
[02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:48.551]  So Trump bluffed him, and he went, you got an ace card?
[02:19:48.711 --> 02:19:51.131]  Well, I got one I pulled out of my butt here, too.
[02:19:53.472 --> 02:19:54.112]  Fully cooked.
[02:19:55.925 --> 02:19:57.086]  Trillions more in the stock market.
[02:19:57.387 --> 02:19:58.508]  Hundreds of billions in jobs.
[02:19:58.728 --> 02:19:59.649]  Restoring the country.
[02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:01.211]  Protecting police getting killed.
[02:20:01.451 --> 02:20:02.933]  Taking care of veterans.
[02:20:03.153 --> 02:20:03.714]  You want that?
[02:20:03.894 --> 02:20:04.254]  I'm here.
[02:20:04.455 --> 02:20:05.676]  You want to go with the same scum?
[02:20:05.696 --> 02:20:06.157]  Go with them.
[02:20:06.217 --> 02:20:06.517]  Fine.
[02:20:06.717 --> 02:20:07.939]  Destroy me if you want to.
[02:20:08.299 --> 02:20:10.441]  I'm standing on this and that's the end of it.
[02:20:10.462 --> 02:20:11.403]  And they don't know what to do.
[02:20:12.526 --> 02:20:13.447]  Well, exactly.
[02:20:13.607 --> 02:20:23.213]  And the other part of this, the never-Trumpers, and we have to really focus on the never-Trumpers, and the establishment Republicans, the previous, the Ryans, the McCain group.
[02:20:23.233 --> 02:20:24.014]  They're the fifth column.
[02:20:24.894 --> 02:20:25.335]  Exactly.
[02:20:25.355 --> 02:20:26.095]  And you know something?
[02:20:26.115 --> 02:20:32.340]  I'm so tired of these snot-nosed, mealy-mouthed, spineless Republican conservatives.
[02:20:32.520 --> 02:20:32.860]  Exactly.
[02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:42.125]  He wanted somebody to kill GPPs, secure the border, put conservatives on, he's doing it all, and they sit around and bitch where the strongman stumbled when they're not in the arena.
[02:20:42.305 --> 02:20:45.327]  And that's why I back Trump when he's under attack more than ever.
[02:20:45.547 --> 02:20:47.768]  And I expect that if I'm going down.
[02:20:48.749 --> 02:20:49.109]  Exactly.
[02:20:49.730 --> 02:20:54.212]  And if we are in a war, if we truly believe what we're saying that we're in a war, then let's act like it.
[02:20:54.632 --> 02:20:58.114]  Let's start, let's start bringing, let's, let's do it.
[02:20:58.334 --> 02:20:58.994]  Legally, of course.
[02:20:59.334 --> 02:21:03.176]  You know, through the legal systems and through... We need to have that attitude because they're all saying it's a war.
[02:21:03.216 --> 02:21:04.477]  In fact, let's start playing some clips.
[02:21:05.237 --> 02:21:14.602]  This president has done in his first hundred plus days, even before he came into office, is pick fights with the intelligence community and now the law enforcement community.
[02:21:15.123 --> 02:21:24.768]  Particularly the way, never mind that he fired James Comey, but the way in which he did it, not giving him the respect of actually telling him in person or at least not having him find out from cable news.
[02:21:25.528 --> 02:21:26.469]  I mean, Dana Bash
[02:21:27.699 --> 02:21:29.520]  Now Trump's anti-police.
[02:21:30.440 --> 02:21:43.067]  This is the party that's given $500 million, just from Soros alone, to Black Lives Matter and other liberal groups like the Red Brigades and people that are literally saying kill cops and random white people.
[02:21:43.087 --> 02:21:44.687]  It's not even blacks doing it, mainly.
[02:21:44.707 --> 02:21:47.048]  It's a bunch of white socialists and communists.
[02:21:47.489 --> 02:21:49.610]  They're the ones running around saying kill everybody.
[02:21:50.410 --> 02:21:54.940]  They're the ones that want the UN to run local police, and then they say Trump's the enemy of police.
[02:21:55.381 --> 02:21:59.610]  Everything that comes out of their fat mouths is a bona fide, certified lie!
[02:21:59.911 --> 02:22:01.013]  Now let's go to Chuckie Schumer.
[02:22:02.003 --> 02:22:06.604]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[02:22:07.164 --> 02:22:12.766]  So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[02:22:12.826 --> 02:22:15.566]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were motivated?
[02:22:15.586 --> 02:22:22.228]  I don't know, but from what I am told, they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them.
[02:22:23.028 --> 02:22:24.108]  He's doing the right thing.
[02:22:24.388 --> 02:22:25.829]  Let the chips fall where they may.
[02:22:25.849 --> 02:22:27.089]  That's why he said these tweets.
[02:22:27.629 --> 02:22:28.649]  I'm going to go all the way.
[02:22:28.789 --> 02:22:29.750]  I'm going to double down.
[02:22:29.850 --> 02:22:30.730]  I'm going to be strong.
[02:22:30.810 --> 02:22:31.850]  I need you to be strong.
[02:22:32.190 --> 02:22:33.191]  I'm going to do the right thing.
[02:22:33.291 --> 02:22:34.291]  I'm not going to stop.
[02:22:35.291 --> 02:22:36.711]  That's called commitment.
[02:22:36.911 --> 02:22:42.273]  And these cowards that all get around the little coward groups, Doug, they don't know what it's like to commit to something.
[02:22:42.613 --> 02:22:44.713]  They think they go with whatever the easiest road is.
[02:22:44.933 --> 02:22:47.054]  That creates North Korea or Venezuela.
[02:22:47.754 --> 02:22:50.235]  Stuff that Trump's doing created America!
[02:22:50.275 --> 02:22:50.935]  Get used to it!
[02:22:51.175 --> 02:22:53.256]  Donald Trump is an American!
[02:22:54.517 --> 02:22:58.879]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:22:58.979 --> 02:23:09.903]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:23:10.083 --> 02:23:15.005]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:23:15.125 --> 02:23:17.627]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:23:17.707 --> 02:23:19.187]  It helps detoxify.
[02:23:19.427 --> 02:23:22.249]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:27.051]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:23:27.071 --> 02:23:31.213]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[02:23:31.633 --> 02:23:38.639]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:23:38.759 --> 02:23:40.180]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[02:23:40.380 --> 02:23:41.101]  This is so key.
[02:23:41.361 --> 02:23:45.664]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:23:45.684 --> 02:23:47.786]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:23:47.906 --> 02:23:51.369]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:23:59.705 --> 02:24:03.511]  Man, we got so many powerful clips we've just now found from the two and a half hour testimony.
[02:24:03.531 --> 02:24:08.159]  They cut short because Comey was committing seppuku in front of everyone.
[02:24:08.199 --> 02:24:09.741]  Harry Carey at suicide.
[02:24:11.314 --> 02:24:12.034]  This is amazing.
[02:24:12.454 --> 02:24:16.836]  But here's Marco Rubio, who I usually don't like, but he has some of the best questions there.
[02:24:16.856 --> 02:24:20.917]  And I was just learning from Stone some interesting inside baseball he might be able to tell you about here in a minute.
[02:24:20.937 --> 02:24:22.258]  I'm not sure if it's secret or not.
[02:24:22.838 --> 02:24:27.100]  But Rubio says, is the only thing you didn't leak that you knew Trump was innocent?
[02:24:27.320 --> 02:24:36.963]  Because exactly what I've been saying, and I didn't see this part of the testimony, he just let this go on and on and on with the memo and the press and everything that Trump had done all these things that he now says he didn't do.
[02:24:37.283 --> 02:24:38.404]  So he just let Trump...
[02:24:39.833 --> 02:24:44.256]  You know, fly around out there in the wind, but again, Trump has nine lives.
[02:24:44.477 --> 02:24:45.697]  He defeats the scallywags.
[02:24:45.717 --> 02:24:46.258]  Here's the clip.
[02:24:46.878 --> 02:24:55.465]  Can you please tell the American people what these leaders in Congress already know, what you already know, what you've told me three times, that I'm not personally under investigation?
[02:24:56.417 --> 02:24:57.638]  Those are the three things he asked.
[02:24:57.678 --> 02:24:57.998]  Yes, sir.
[02:24:58.359 --> 02:25:00.880]  You know, this investigation is full of leaks left and right.
[02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:04.783]  I mean, we've learned more from the newspapers sometimes than we do from our open hearings, for sure.
[02:25:04.803 --> 02:25:18.474]  Do you ever wonder why, of all the things in this investigation, the only thing that's never been leaked is the fact that the president was not personally under investigation, despite the fact that both Democrats and Republicans and the leadership of Congress knew that and have known that for weeks?
[02:25:20.345 --> 02:25:20.765]  I don't know.
[02:25:21.006 --> 02:25:26.870]  I find matters that are brief to the Gang of Eight are pretty tightly held, in my experience.
[02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:31.393]  Finally, who are those senior leaders at the FBI that you share these conversations with?
[02:25:32.213 --> 02:25:48.664]  As I said in response to Senator Feinstein's question, Deputy Director, my Chief of Staff, General Counsel, Deputy Directors, Chief Counsel, and then, more often than not, the number three person at the FBI, who's the Associate Deputy Director, and then quite often, the head of the National Security Branch.
[02:25:49.545 --> 02:25:52.826]  Wow, how amazing, how unbelievable, how historic.
[02:25:53.326 --> 02:25:57.047]  He just said, oh, the Gang of Eight, they're really good at not leaking, except for you.
[02:25:58.068 --> 02:25:58.348]  You.
[02:25:58.548 --> 02:25:59.968]  And we know it isn't just this.
[02:26:00.608 --> 02:26:05.450]  Roger Stone, in your gut, I know you've been talking to the Senate committee, you've been talking to them quite a bit.
[02:26:06.390 --> 02:26:08.891]  I mean, is it not clear that Comey probably is one of the main leakers?
[02:26:10.311 --> 02:26:11.612]  I think it's apparent, Alex.
[02:26:11.652 --> 02:26:15.153]  First of all, a shout out to Mr. Comey's plastic surgeon.
[02:26:15.959 --> 02:26:17.564]  A lot of Botox going on there.
[02:26:17.905 --> 02:26:18.306]  A lot.
[02:26:18.386 --> 02:26:21.414]  If you notice, his face barely moves when he speaks.
[02:26:22.188 --> 02:26:26.411]  Maybe he should get with Nancy Pelosi, in any event.
[02:26:26.451 --> 02:26:31.254]  Yeah, you had essentially a stunning revelation here that he is a leaker.
[02:26:31.774 --> 02:26:36.097]  Why would we then believe that this was the only time that he leaked?
[02:26:36.257 --> 02:26:46.704]  The intelligence services, particularly the Central Intelligence Agency, but the 17 vaunted agencies we keep hearing about, have leaked like a sieve.
[02:26:47.344 --> 02:26:49.365]  And those leaks are a crime.
[02:26:49.545 --> 02:26:51.366]  That's not a leak of political information.
[02:26:51.426 --> 02:26:55.009]  That's a leak of stuff they learned in surveillance.
[02:26:55.089 --> 02:26:56.830]  That is patently illegal.
[02:26:57.670 --> 02:27:00.792]  These are Obama holdovers who are doing the leaking.
[02:27:01.172 --> 02:27:06.956]  And they've done it to try to destabilize and delegitimize the presidency of Donald Trump.
[02:27:07.716 --> 02:27:13.459]  I think that their whole scheme is laid bare today by this devastating testimony.
[02:27:14.620 --> 02:27:17.421]  Comey stumbled out of the Senate hearing room.
[02:27:17.601 --> 02:27:18.201]  That's right.
[02:27:19.002 --> 02:27:20.142]  I've been struggling for the word.
[02:27:20.182 --> 02:27:21.583]  This was improper.
[02:27:21.623 --> 02:27:23.384]  I've been struggling for the word, Roger Stone.
[02:27:23.624 --> 02:27:27.105]  This was devastating to the media, their lies, the whole Russia thing.
[02:27:27.305 --> 02:27:30.266]  And then we've got people with high-level security clearances like this Ms.
[02:27:30.406 --> 02:27:35.348]  Winner, who believes white people should be genocided, and that being white is terrorist.
[02:27:35.648 --> 02:27:38.449]  This is the insane people the left have put in charge of everything.
[02:27:38.729 --> 02:27:40.790]  Total, lunatic, racist, crazy people.
[02:27:41.330 --> 02:27:41.871]  Go ahead, Roger.
[02:27:41.891 --> 02:27:42.111]  Sorry.
[02:27:42.771 --> 02:27:55.596]  Well, today in the Washington Post, there is an op-ed by Philip Lacovara who says, I prosecuted Nixon in the Watergate matter and I know obstruction when I see it.
[02:27:56.468 --> 02:28:03.153]  Mr. Lacovara, you met with and communicated illegally with Judge Sirica in the Watergate case.
[02:28:03.894 --> 02:28:05.835]  You should have been disbarred then.
[02:28:06.396 --> 02:28:10.859]  I'm going to be filing a complaint against you now, which is still ripe.
[02:28:10.919 --> 02:28:12.640]  You should be disbarred now.
[02:28:13.081 --> 02:28:18.305]  Those meetings, those communications, ex-parte with Sirica were completely illegal.
[02:28:18.805 --> 02:28:20.166]  You will have to pay a penalty.
[02:28:20.527 --> 02:28:22.328]  Don't lecture us about Donald Trump.
[02:28:22.668 --> 02:28:26.251]  You yourself have violated the law, Mr. Lacovara.
[02:28:26.611 --> 02:28:30.978]  We got a minute and a half left, then I'm going to come back, hit calls, then David Knight's coming in, but I promise callers, I'm going to you first.
[02:28:31.438 --> 02:28:32.400]  Chris, Nicole, everybody.
[02:28:33.702 --> 02:28:34.783]  How are they going to come back?
[02:28:34.803 --> 02:28:36.065]  I mean, I know they're going to say he's mentally ill.
[02:28:36.085 --> 02:28:36.726]  That's not working.
[02:28:36.786 --> 02:28:37.127]  What else?
[02:28:37.167 --> 02:28:38.048]  Try to assassinate him?
[02:28:38.088 --> 02:28:38.769]  Summer of Rage?
[02:28:39.049 --> 02:28:39.690]  Civil Unrest?
[02:28:39.991 --> 02:28:40.672]  They're not giving up.
[02:28:40.732 --> 02:28:42.655]  What do they do now after this huge, devastating defeat?
[02:28:43.868 --> 02:28:47.951]  Well Alex, I think you're exactly right about the President turning the corner.
[02:28:48.492 --> 02:29:09.409]  And perhaps he can now finally devote his full attentions to rebuilding our economy, rebuilding our foreign relations, having a foreign policy that is based in common sense, sealing our borders from the hordes of young Islamic men who would like to come here to rape and pillage and assault American citizens.
[02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:10.309]  Got slit women's throats.
[02:29:11.711 --> 02:29:28.610]  This is the Trump agenda, and if the president will stick to his agenda, and so far so good, even though he has surrounded himself with establishment quizlings, he's managed to ignore most of their advice and stick to what he told the American people he would do.
[02:29:28.750 --> 02:29:29.912]  Paris, for example.
[02:29:29.932 --> 02:29:30.492]  That's right.
[02:29:30.533 --> 02:29:31.113]  Roger Stone?
[02:29:32.014 --> 02:29:32.935]  I want to commend you.
[02:29:33.075 --> 02:29:36.358]  We are now really entering the major victory zone.
[02:29:37.580 --> 02:29:40.803]  The victory we've secured so far is now being really, really cemented.
[02:29:41.343 --> 02:29:45.928]  And so cause for celebration to the listeners and you and everybody and President Trump.
[02:29:46.849 --> 02:29:49.691]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:49.912 --> 02:29:50.732]  Big victory, folks.
[02:29:50.812 --> 02:29:51.313]  It's a big deal.
[02:29:51.333 --> 02:29:56.538]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[02:29:58.331 --> 02:30:04.015]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[02:30:04.715 --> 02:30:08.678]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[02:30:09.558 --> 02:30:11.779]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[02:30:11.879 --> 02:30:13.020]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[02:30:13.060 --> 02:30:16.262]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[02:30:17.243 --> 02:30:17.603]  Or more.
[02:30:17.663 --> 02:30:19.624]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[02:30:20.105 --> 02:30:21.585]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[02:30:21.686 --> 02:30:25.048]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[02:30:25.148 --> 02:30:26.909]  It's actually scary.
[02:30:27.779 --> 02:30:37.888]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[02:30:38.869 --> 02:30:51.680]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.

[02:31:54.980 --> 02:31:56.621]  Here's something you won't hear on the fake news.
[02:31:56.841 --> 02:32:02.605]  According to the Daily Caller, Trump's approval rating is actually higher than Bill Clinton's was at the same point in his presidency.
[02:32:02.665 --> 02:32:11.790]  That's despite all the negative media attention, the wild goose hunt over bogus charges of Russia's involvement in the election, and the unending chorus of anti-Trump talking heads on network news.
[02:32:12.130 --> 02:32:16.993]  Even the liberal rag Newsweek magazine had to admit Trump's approval rating was better than Bill Clinton's at 160 days in.
[02:32:18.194 --> 02:32:25.599]  While Trump's approval rating is only hovering around the 40% mark, he's still doing better than Clinton, who only had 37% approval at 138 days in.
[02:32:25.899 --> 02:32:30.863]  Of course, Trump's disapproval rating is also higher than Clinton's, at 57% compared to Clinton's 49%.
[02:32:31.883 --> 02:32:32.684]  But what do you expect?
[02:32:32.904 --> 02:32:36.987]  Bill Clinton was lauded as the poster boy of everything cool about modern liberalism.
[02:32:37.147 --> 02:32:42.511]  Meanwhile, Trump and his family have been put under a microscope and have been under constant assault even before he got elected.
[02:32:42.691 --> 02:32:45.733]  Despite all the negativity, Trump's numbers continue to climb.
[02:32:45.953 --> 02:32:49.054]  Which is proof that the fake media's narrative is dying.
[02:32:49.354 --> 02:32:52.035]  Reporting for InfoWars.com, I'm Jay Michaels.
[02:32:55.176 --> 02:33:01.418]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:01.718 --> 02:33:07.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.391 --> 02:33:25.175]  Alright, I've got Jason, and I've got Steven, and I've got Cole, and I've got Chris, and I've got Rod, who've been holding some of them 50 minutes.
[02:33:25.215 --> 02:33:28.676]  So we're gonna bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bing, bong, bing, bing, bong, bong, bing.
[02:33:28.977 --> 02:33:31.638]  We're gonna go through those phone calls, and then we've got David Knight here.
[02:33:32.563 --> 02:33:36.126]  Who did a great job the day holding his tongue.
[02:33:36.467 --> 02:33:37.167]  I would have been worse.
[02:33:37.668 --> 02:33:42.252]  Everybody knows we can cover the live debates because we're giving analysis and commentary.
[02:33:42.272 --> 02:33:44.835]  But we have to give commentary for Fair Use to be able to do it.
[02:33:45.455 --> 02:33:46.516]  Even if it's government produced.
[02:33:46.596 --> 02:33:49.039]  Well, we're covering C-SPAN's live feed here.
[02:33:50.180 --> 02:33:51.401]  David had limited comments.
[02:33:51.541 --> 02:33:52.502]  A lot he wanted to say.
[02:33:53.443 --> 02:33:54.964]  I talk three times more than he does.
[02:33:54.984 --> 02:33:56.866]  And of course, we provide it on InfoWars.com.
[02:33:58.027 --> 02:34:05.916]  The clean feed from C-SPAN, the feed with his limited commentary, and then me, where you probably, you know, in the first hour got five minutes of the live feed.
[02:34:06.236 --> 02:34:10.781]  And I saw on our feed, on Facebook and YouTube and InfoWars, going, Jones, shut up!
[02:34:11.542 --> 02:34:16.747]  And the reason I'm addressing this here is not that anybody did anything bad, it's that listeners are wonderful people.
[02:34:17.268 --> 02:34:19.430]  But that we can't always just listen to the trolls.
[02:34:20.191 --> 02:34:25.655]  Because we were very clear every 10 minutes to say we have clean feeds at Infowars.com or go elsewhere.
[02:34:25.835 --> 02:34:26.876]  It's everywhere in the world.
[02:34:27.416 --> 02:34:43.607]  So you got to ask yourself with that nanny state culture, not the majority of our listeners, not even a minority, but a very small number of people that just pick things to bitch about instead of, wow, I'm glad you're here giving us an alternative feed and grabbing clips so that as soon as it was over, we could have an analysis.
[02:34:43.827 --> 02:34:46.308]  And I don't want to give attention to the 1% of complainers.
[02:34:46.829 --> 02:34:49.791]  I just want to point out to listeners, they shouldn't give those type of folks
[02:34:50.711 --> 02:35:01.199]  Because we've got all these clips to play, your calls to go to, David's analysis of stuff he couldn't get to, with all the notes he wrote down today, and Anthony Cumia coming up, and the nightly news tonight.
[02:35:01.460 --> 02:35:06.023]  But David walked in and said, oh, people were complaining I was talking too much, and I heard you were.
[02:35:06.464 --> 02:35:13.069]  Only at like one point, because he couldn't hear me, I wanted to go to him in the cross feeds, and we're trying to work out the complex new studios we built.
[02:35:13.869 --> 02:35:14.650]  Nobody's bad.
[02:35:14.970 --> 02:35:16.932]  This is all complex wargaming.
[02:35:17.232 --> 02:35:23.037]  High-tech satellite, TV satellite, radio satellite, studios, people in different areas.
[02:35:23.517 --> 02:35:27.620]  We are in the growth pains here at InfoWars, and this is a celebration.
[02:35:27.961 --> 02:35:33.685]  A celebration to our entire crew, our affiliates, our listeners, and to God above for the blessing of life.
[02:35:34.226 --> 02:35:34.926]  Just everybody.
[02:35:34.966 --> 02:35:35.767]  This is amazing.
[02:35:36.347 --> 02:35:38.029]  We totally, absolutely kicked butt.
[02:35:38.109 --> 02:35:39.230]  Comey melted down.
[02:35:39.530 --> 02:35:41.832]  InfoWars and Drudge, everybody had great coverage.
[02:35:42.412 --> 02:35:42.792]  There was
[02:35:43.693 --> 02:35:44.393]  Donald Jr.
[02:35:44.413 --> 02:35:46.815]  with his dad, surrogate, tweeting in live time.
[02:35:46.835 --> 02:35:48.155]  That was really the President, pretty much.
[02:35:48.575 --> 02:35:51.697]  I mean, this was... You can't have the President give them too much attention.
[02:35:51.717 --> 02:35:53.538]  I don't want to give folks too much inside baseball.
[02:35:53.898 --> 02:35:59.680]  But this is an amazing time to have the President kicking the liar's ass in live time through his son on Twitter.
[02:35:59.700 --> 02:36:00.861]  A lot of it was his son as well.
[02:36:01.201 --> 02:36:04.143]  I was writing tweets and then I would see that Donald Jr.
[02:36:04.183 --> 02:36:05.604]  had just sent the exact same thing out.
[02:36:05.865 --> 02:36:09.327]  Not that we're synced up, because he did perjure himself.
[02:36:10.008 --> 02:36:11.609]  Comey did admit he was the leaker.
[02:36:11.829 --> 02:36:15.112]  He did admit he was political and shut down investigations into the Clintons.
[02:36:15.312 --> 02:36:17.573]  He did admit that Trump wasn't under investigation.
[02:36:17.613 --> 02:36:18.234]  He told him that.
[02:36:18.574 --> 02:36:21.496]  Everything the media denied, it was a total rout.
[02:36:21.617 --> 02:36:28.161]  And if we let the media spin it like, well, the Russia investigation goes on, this was inconclusive, that's kind of their spin.
[02:36:28.222 --> 02:36:28.322]  No.
[02:36:29.264 --> 02:36:30.345]  They have egg on their face.
[02:36:31.145 --> 02:36:34.687]  They've been discredited worse than all their fake polls and the WikiLeaks and all that garbage.
[02:36:35.488 --> 02:36:38.410]  This is a devastating defeat for these people.
[02:36:38.770 --> 02:36:41.151]  Comey, Loretta Lynch, MSM, all of them.
[02:36:41.171 --> 02:36:43.193]  That's exactly what I'm saying and now Trump's sending it out.
[02:36:43.333 --> 02:36:44.253]  Because we saw the same thing.
[02:36:44.513 --> 02:36:46.635]  This was a galactic rout.
[02:36:47.415 --> 02:36:50.096]  And we have to realize the effect you, the listeners, are having.
[02:36:50.376 --> 02:36:54.257]  Our affiliates, those local stations you're listening to, are the biggest heroes out there.
[02:36:54.477 --> 02:36:57.738]  What they get targeted with, how they get boycotted behind the scenes, you don't know, listeners.
[02:36:58.038 --> 02:36:59.139]  Send them $100 a week.
[02:36:59.399 --> 02:37:00.199]  Become a sponsor.
[02:37:00.779 --> 02:37:08.542]  Instead of worrying about the trolls bitching, that's why I'm giving this speech, let's think about the fact that we're not perfect, but we're in the arena like Teddy Roosevelt said.
[02:37:09.122 --> 02:37:11.086]  Somebody print me the arena speech, please.
[02:37:11.366 --> 02:37:12.909]  And we are kicking ass!
[02:37:13.169 --> 02:37:14.091]  Because I get mad.
[02:37:14.171 --> 02:37:16.274]  I had a perfect interview the other night with Megyn Kelly.
[02:37:16.615 --> 02:37:17.336]  I was exhausted.
[02:37:17.657 --> 02:37:18.859]  They've been here since 9 in the morning.
[02:37:19.861 --> 02:37:20.562]  We finished at almost 11.
[02:37:21.262 --> 02:37:27.066]  I did okay, but I knew they could snippet out a few things where I got tired, or where stuff was going on, and I got mad at myself.
[02:37:27.086 --> 02:37:31.189]  I was actually depressed for about half a day, and said some mean stuff about Megan I probably should have said as well.
[02:37:31.649 --> 02:37:33.490]  But the point is it didn't matter, because then I realized it didn't matter.
[02:37:33.631 --> 02:37:34.411]  I'm in the arena!
[02:37:34.611 --> 02:37:35.592]  We changed history!
[02:37:35.772 --> 02:37:36.453]  We're winning!
[02:37:36.633 --> 02:37:37.553]  We're dominating!
[02:37:37.693 --> 02:37:38.394]  For good!
[02:37:38.574 --> 02:37:39.555]  Let's celebrate it!
[02:37:39.695 --> 02:37:40.736]  Let's be happy about it!
[02:37:41.376 --> 02:37:42.036]  Give me a high five!
[02:37:42.237 --> 02:37:42.757]  Yeah!
[02:37:42.937 --> 02:37:44.178]  David Knight, we're gonna go to these calls.
[02:37:44.198 --> 02:37:45.319]  They've been holding for an hour, but go ahead.
[02:37:45.885 --> 02:37:59.577]  You know Alex, one of the things, the dog that did not bark that I was so upset about at the end of this hearing when Burr was summarizing everything very calmly, you know, if you want to watch the thing uninterrupted without comment, then just go to NPR and take some Prozac.
[02:37:59.837 --> 02:38:04.521]  But you need to understand that the real threat here, when Megyn Kelly was here the other day, she said, what do you think about Putin?
[02:38:04.541 --> 02:38:05.582]  I said, he's just ex-KGB.
[02:38:06.543 --> 02:38:11.447]  I said, the people we need to be concerned about are the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, who have
[02:38:11.747 --> 02:38:15.790]  We're actively engaged in politics and we've had Senator Grassley, Senator Paul point this out.
[02:38:15.810 --> 02:38:20.913]  We've had the FISA court point out their crimes and do something very unprecedented.
[02:38:21.053 --> 02:38:29.118]  Immediately declassify a statement talking about how their court decision, talking about how the FBI and the NSA had violated laws.
[02:38:29.378 --> 02:38:30.439]  Where's the investigation of that?
[02:38:30.599 --> 02:38:31.539]  Where's the oversight of that?
[02:38:31.579 --> 02:38:36.422]  And again, we've got good people in the government fighting to expose rogue elements in the government.
[02:38:36.442 --> 02:38:37.423]  It's not the whole deep state.
[02:38:37.523 --> 02:38:40.425]  I'm not defending deep state, but rogue elements in the secret government.
[02:38:41.232 --> 02:38:44.334]  Going after our president because he's a real American!
[02:38:44.575 --> 02:38:47.137]  He's actually trying to restore the republic!
[02:38:47.837 --> 02:38:55.443]  You know, it began with Burr saying, we have the obligation here at the Senate Intelligence Committee to make sure that the intelligence agencies are following the law.
[02:38:55.463 --> 02:38:56.664]  And that's what they did not do.
[02:38:56.704 --> 02:38:57.565]  They did not talk about that.
[02:38:57.585 --> 02:38:58.826]  But let's talk about what they did talk about.
[02:38:59.126 --> 02:39:01.408]  You mentioned that Comey exposed himself as a leaker.
[02:39:01.668 --> 02:39:02.749]  He made comments about how
[02:39:03.169 --> 02:39:03.849]  Multiple times.
[02:39:03.909 --> 02:39:05.350]  Yeah, that story from the New York Times.
[02:39:05.390 --> 02:39:07.850]  Yeah, it was pretty much all fake news.
[02:39:07.870 --> 02:39:08.790]  It wasn't any of that true.
[02:39:09.150 --> 02:39:10.991]  But they're playing with semantics.
[02:39:11.011 --> 02:39:13.191]  There's three words that they're trying to leverage this in.
[02:39:13.231 --> 02:39:16.832]  And I was just looking at the feed that we have of CNN.
[02:39:16.872 --> 02:39:20.033]  Of course, they're saying, oh, Comey was, it was just such a big win for Comey.
[02:39:20.133 --> 02:39:20.493]  Oh, really?
[02:39:20.993 --> 02:39:21.233]  Really?
[02:39:21.393 --> 02:39:22.374]  Let's talk about what happened.
[02:39:22.434 --> 02:39:23.454]  So now we know what they're doing.
[02:39:23.494 --> 02:39:26.975]  I mean, total loss, clear cut, like 75-0 football game.
[02:39:27.955 --> 02:39:29.536]  What's the record NFL loss?
[02:39:29.596 --> 02:39:31.318]  Isn't it like 89-0 or something?
[02:39:31.978 --> 02:39:32.999]  Matt's a big sports guy.
[02:39:33.039 --> 02:39:33.619]  I used to be too.
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:34.540]  Matt, what is it?
[02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:35.261]  Matt, look it up.
[02:39:35.561 --> 02:39:37.242]  What is the biggest loss ever?
[02:39:37.563 --> 02:39:37.883]  What is it?
[02:39:39.414 --> 02:39:40.115]  Well, let's look up.
[02:39:40.335 --> 02:39:42.056]  The biggest NFL loss in history.
[02:39:42.256 --> 02:39:43.477]  The largest point spread.
[02:39:43.677 --> 02:39:44.998]  I mean, this was a rout.
[02:39:45.298 --> 02:39:46.439]  This was an open and shut.
[02:39:46.619 --> 02:39:47.840]  This was a domination.
[02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:49.301]  This was a bone crusher.
[02:39:49.522 --> 02:39:52.584]  This was an absolute, complete win for the truth.
[02:39:52.784 --> 02:39:59.529]  A repudiation of the media, Lynch, the Clintons, Obama, the globalists, the fake Russian narrative, all of it!
[02:39:59.809 --> 02:40:05.313]  A vindication of our president telling us the truth, and then CNN wants to try to spin it!
[02:40:05.333 --> 02:40:05.914]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:40:06.394 --> 02:40:09.755]  Well, you know, what we saw was Comey's character when they hit him on this.
[02:40:09.795 --> 02:40:12.596]  They said, well, you know, what about what you did with Hillary Clinton?
[02:40:13.497 --> 02:40:24.041]  And he had testified that Loretta Lynch had wanted him to use the terms, we're looking into a matter, instead of we are investigating Hillary Clinton over violation of national security.
[02:40:24.061 --> 02:40:24.661]  And that's the way he spun it.
[02:40:24.681 --> 02:40:28.963]  Well, what came out then is he really wanted to end the criminal investigation and just call it a matter.
[02:40:29.063 --> 02:40:29.363]  That's right.
[02:40:29.443 --> 02:40:30.864]  Those terms mean two different things.
[02:40:31.084 --> 02:40:32.364]  It isn't a semantical term.
[02:40:32.664 --> 02:40:34.325]  It's whether it is a matter.
[02:40:34.525 --> 02:40:34.846]  Yes, yes.
[02:40:52.088 --> 02:40:52.988]  Yeah, you're going to go through.
[02:40:53.028 --> 02:40:53.928]  That's why I got your whole list.
[02:40:53.968 --> 02:40:54.769]  I know you're chomping at the bit.
[02:40:55.069 --> 02:40:57.489]  Let's go to these calls and we're going to let this lion off the leash.
[02:40:57.829 --> 02:41:00.130]  Because I know you had to sit there and not talk 90% of the time.
[02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:02.370]  And I know it's tough because I couldn't have done what you were doing.
[02:41:02.610 --> 02:41:04.271]  What I'm saying, like, let him talk, David.
[02:41:04.291 --> 02:41:05.891]  I'm telling myself that because I'm worse than you.
[02:41:06.851 --> 02:41:10.712]  Let's go ahead and go to, hmm, who's been holding the longest?
[02:41:10.752 --> 02:41:12.992]  Let's go to, who held over?
[02:41:14.593 --> 02:41:14.833]  That's right.
[02:41:14.853 --> 02:41:17.373]  We're going to go to Jason, then Chris, then Cole, then Steven, then Rod.
[02:41:17.733 --> 02:41:19.194]  Jason in the great state of Connecticut.
[02:41:19.374 --> 02:41:20.354]  You got caught off by a break.
[02:41:20.374 --> 02:41:21.034]  Go ahead and make your point.
[02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:34.117]  Yeah, so like I was saying before, you know, Comey might go down, and he's doing it just so they can push the Russia narrative even further, saying that, oh, you know, he had to say this stuff.
[02:41:35.009 --> 02:41:39.770]  Just so they could get the special counsel and prosecutor in there, and he had to save us from the Russians.
[02:41:39.930 --> 02:41:42.190]  So he was being weak and cowardly because of that.
[02:41:42.610 --> 02:41:47.811]  I'm not sure how much weight that holds, but... Yes, let me ask David Knight that question, and then he'll come back, Jason.
[02:41:48.371 --> 02:41:51.812]  And just briefly, we've got all these calls, but is there a method to the madness?
[02:41:51.932 --> 02:41:53.192]  Is there something else we see?
[02:41:53.332 --> 02:41:54.252]  I've looked at this carefully.
[02:41:54.673 --> 02:41:55.953]  The Democrats are out of control.
[02:41:56.033 --> 02:41:56.973]  Comey's out of control.
[02:41:57.193 --> 02:41:58.253]  They're showing real fear.
[02:41:58.393 --> 02:42:02.074]  I can see where Trump manipulated them to show their hand, to release the memo.
[02:42:03.194 --> 02:42:04.916]  I don't think that there's something behind this.
[02:42:05.096 --> 02:42:13.082]  I think we're watching these people finally facing an intellect and a HUMET group of citizens out in the public that are ready to take them on.
[02:42:13.643 --> 02:42:14.223]  We'll have to see.
[02:42:14.263 --> 02:42:29.395]  Maybe some of the comments that have been made back and forth the last few days about the concerns that the friction between Trump and Attorney General Sessions is because maybe Trump is trying to get him to actually do his job and criminally prosecute people inside the government who violate the law.
[02:42:29.635 --> 02:42:30.516]  People like Comey.
[02:42:30.556 --> 02:42:31.637]  Sure, but here's the bottom line.
[02:42:32.217 --> 02:42:36.180]  The caller is saying, what can come out of Comey apparently blowing up and self-destructing?
[02:42:36.660 --> 02:42:37.961]  I think it was a real self-destruct.
[02:42:38.142 --> 02:42:39.723]  That's why the media is spinning it as a win.
[02:42:40.003 --> 02:42:45.707]  If they were spinning it as a self-destruct right now, then you know they might be turning apples or lemons into lemonade.
[02:42:46.007 --> 02:42:48.009]  They might be trying to spin out of this.
[02:42:48.449 --> 02:42:52.232]  I see actually them spinning out of control, not knowing what they're doing.
[02:42:52.272 --> 02:42:57.136]  The big dangerous question is, what may they pull now to get their bacon out of the fire?
[02:42:57.216 --> 02:42:57.476]  Jason?
[02:43:00.103 --> 02:43:01.384]  Well, I think just that.
[02:43:02.465 --> 02:43:03.886]  That's all they have at this point.
[02:43:04.106 --> 02:43:14.555]  But going to Sessions, Sessions was just speaking with a bunch of policemen and everyone down in Georgia on the 6th, I believe, about busting pedophiles big time.
[02:43:14.915 --> 02:43:20.960]  So maybe he's very busy doing that and said, you know, I can't really break away from that to go, you know, go after Clinton.
[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:26.044]  Well, we're going after their Luciferian lifeblood over here, all this pedophile, the whole pedophile
[02:43:26.244 --> 02:43:27.704]  There's been over 10,000 arrests now.
[02:43:27.824 --> 02:43:34.346]  I mean, Trump is moving against the... They just busted the head of Penn State for covering up, and now they're saying they may arrest hundreds.
[02:43:34.446 --> 02:43:35.347]  I mean, they are scared.
[02:43:35.607 --> 02:43:43.429]  Trump is the real... Folks, Trump's the real deal, and everybody should have trouble sleeping right now, because this is... I'm gonna make this announcement.
[02:43:43.829 --> 02:43:46.690]  We're in a civil war, and Trump has turned the corner.
[02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:48.790]  We are now winning the civil war.
[02:43:49.130 --> 02:43:49.930]  We are now winning.
[02:43:50.030 --> 02:43:51.391]  I'm getting... Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:43:52.093 --> 02:43:52.753]  This is real.
[02:43:53.414 --> 02:43:57.176]  And a lot of times you'll see Trump bring somebody in who's a globalist.
[02:43:57.336 --> 02:44:00.477]  All he's doing is getting the intel from them because they're so narcissistic.
[02:44:01.478 --> 02:44:02.498]  And then he's destroying them.
[02:44:03.099 --> 02:44:04.760]  I mean, this is biblical, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:07.341]  You've got to recognize it when it's happening.
[02:44:07.361 --> 02:44:08.802]  There's no way this is a deception now.
[02:44:09.082 --> 02:44:11.123]  This is irrevocably damaging them.
[02:44:11.463 --> 02:44:12.524]  Thank you, Jason.
[02:44:12.964 --> 02:44:14.144]  I mean, I see you nodding your head.
[02:44:16.063 --> 02:44:17.824]  We are turning the corner on the Civil War right now.
[02:44:18.205 --> 02:44:22.907]  I think one of the key things that you see here, and Cornyn did a great job in terms of cross-examining him.
[02:44:22.927 --> 02:44:33.093]  One of the things that he pointed out, Alex, was that, okay, you're trying to imply that Donald Trump did something inappropriate, that he tried to obstruct justice in terms of shutting down the Flynn investigation.
[02:44:33.513 --> 02:44:43.016]  But doesn't an FBI agent, not necessarily the FBI director, but any FBI agent, doesn't he have a duty, a legal duty, to make that clear if he sees a crime being committed?
[02:44:43.316 --> 02:44:46.117]  So what he's doing is he's incriminating himself multiple times today.
[02:44:46.337 --> 02:44:51.678]  You had this situation where he had said previously, and we talked about this a great deal, I was never pressured.
[02:44:51.698 --> 02:44:56.200]  It would be a big deal, he said, if anybody ever pressured me politically to shut down an investigation.
[02:44:56.440 --> 02:45:00.381]  Yet today, one of the key words that was going back and forth between the Republicans
[02:45:00.421 --> 02:45:00.741]  I don't know.
[02:45:20.231 --> 02:45:21.192]  He agreed with that.
[02:45:21.313 --> 02:45:22.754]  I've analyzed this and I know what it is.
[02:45:23.415 --> 02:45:23.916]  I'm going to tell you.
[02:45:24.236 --> 02:45:25.839]  They thought they could make this run for president.
[02:45:25.859 --> 02:45:29.463]  They thought they could use disinfo, fake memos, never show the sources.
[02:45:29.884 --> 02:45:31.386]  Trump behind the scenes has called their bluff.
[02:45:31.426 --> 02:45:34.089]  He's ready to release it all as president, as the executive branch.
[02:45:34.129 --> 02:45:35.511]  He can release anything classified he wants.
[02:45:36.132 --> 02:45:38.054]  And they are in free-fall panic mode.
[02:45:38.654 --> 02:45:41.196]  We could see them attack the White House in the next 24 hours.
[02:45:41.236 --> 02:45:42.177]  We could see them start a war.
[02:45:42.757 --> 02:45:46.180]  This is a very dangerous time because right now we are beginning to rout them.
[02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:48.082]  We're not completely routing them yet.
[02:45:48.222 --> 02:45:50.704]  We're turning the tide completely.
[02:45:50.984 --> 02:45:55.588]  We've gone from beachhead to battle to civil war to major collapse of the enemy.
[02:45:56.388 --> 02:45:58.430]  And this is an incredible time.
[02:45:58.850 --> 02:46:00.472]  You already see the Saudis rolling over.
[02:46:01.152 --> 02:46:06.636]  The Russians are ready to roll over, because they see a big, huge, powerful United States that actually wants to work with them.
[02:46:07.116 --> 02:46:09.157]  And this is a big moment, ladies.
[02:46:09.177 --> 02:46:10.278]  The EU is imploding.
[02:46:10.878 --> 02:46:13.000]  They're activating the Muslim brigades in a crisis.
[02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:15.041]  I mean, this is an incredible time.
[02:46:15.061 --> 02:46:15.561]  Let's go to calls.
[02:46:15.601 --> 02:46:16.542]  I've got to be good and go to calls.
[02:46:17.322 --> 02:46:18.003]  Steven in Florida.
[02:46:18.023 --> 02:46:18.923]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:46:21.465 --> 02:46:23.586]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:46:24.927 --> 02:46:29.430]  I want to make your day, come up with, I guess you could say, a rallying cry.
[02:46:30.262 --> 02:46:33.743]  In celebration of what you're talking about with this Comey fiasco.
[02:46:33.783 --> 02:46:41.346]  First of all, I think you ought to come out with a shirt with his caricature on it that says, James Comey Anti-Comey.
[02:46:41.966 --> 02:46:43.707]  I think that would be really fitting.
[02:46:44.367 --> 02:46:46.068]  But here's the main thing.
[02:46:46.948 --> 02:46:52.270]  You should have something that says a lot of lines of, truth trumps lies.
[02:46:53.051 --> 02:46:55.472]  Good trumps evil.
[02:46:56.172 --> 02:46:58.873]  Nationalism trumps globalism.
[02:46:59.736 --> 02:47:04.058]  And InfoWars trumps DisInfoWars.
[02:47:04.639 --> 02:47:05.319]  That's beautiful.
[02:47:05.439 --> 02:47:06.219]  Please say it again.
[02:47:06.239 --> 02:47:07.100]  I want them to tweet that.
[02:47:07.140 --> 02:47:07.860]  It may be too long.
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:12.283]  Or we can do a text shot and then have that, you know, in the bottom as the image.
[02:47:12.603 --> 02:47:13.583]  So I'm going to have Lewis do that.
[02:47:13.603 --> 02:47:16.485]  We'll have that in the bottom, you know, as an image.
[02:47:16.905 --> 02:47:19.106]  And then in the top, we'll just have the first of it, dot, dot, dot.
[02:47:19.406 --> 02:47:20.547]  So say that one more time.
[02:47:22.428 --> 02:47:28.691]  Truth trumps, and trumps is in all capital letters, truth trumps lies.
[02:47:29.642 --> 02:47:32.163]  Good trumps evil.
[02:47:32.804 --> 02:47:35.825]  Nationalism trumps globalism.
[02:47:36.766 --> 02:47:41.228]  Info wars trumps disinfo wars.
[02:47:42.629 --> 02:47:44.690]  Or disinfo MSM enemies, absolutely.
[02:47:45.431 --> 02:47:52.174]  I want to go back to you briefly, but this is breaking news, two different breaking news articles, then I'll go back to you Stephen here in a moment, then Cole, Chris and Rod.
[02:47:52.194 --> 02:47:54.255]  This is out of USA Today.
[02:47:55.373 --> 02:48:00.635]  And this is what I've been saying since this happened an hour and a half ago, or two and a half hours ago before we even went on air live.
[02:48:00.875 --> 02:48:02.896]  You were live at the time with your live feed.
[02:48:03.317 --> 02:48:07.598]  Trump lawyer says James Comey made unauthorized disclosures of privileged talks.
[02:48:07.639 --> 02:48:21.585]  Yes, it's illegal, because only if what Trump was doing was illegal, and he brought it to the Justice Department, and they'd said no, and he brought it to the intelligence committees, then only under law, and I agree with this, could he leak it to the press.
[02:48:22.185 --> 02:48:22.285]  Okay.
[02:48:22.305 --> 02:48:23.707]  He wants to have his cake and eat it too.
[02:48:23.927 --> 02:48:27.551]  He wants to have his... He wants to allege that there's illegal operations going on here, but then he kept it to himself.
[02:48:27.591 --> 02:48:28.492]  He tried to justice.
[02:48:28.692 --> 02:48:29.633]  He didn't report it to anybody.
[02:48:29.653 --> 02:48:30.534]  He probably needs to be indicted.
[02:48:30.594 --> 02:48:30.794]  Yeah.
[02:48:31.195 --> 02:48:34.839]  And listen, we're not looking for trouble, but they want to put our president in jail.
[02:48:35.099 --> 02:48:36.140]  They want to bring in jihadis.
[02:48:36.160 --> 02:48:37.441]  They want to bankrupt the stock market.
[02:48:37.461 --> 02:48:38.963]  They want to screw over America.
[02:48:39.584 --> 02:48:40.525]  They want war.
[02:48:40.905 --> 02:48:42.086]  Let's give them Info War!
[02:48:42.106 --> 02:48:43.467]  And let's give them Judicial War!
[02:48:43.487 --> 02:48:44.768]  And let's give them Legislative War!
[02:48:44.928 --> 02:48:46.449]  And let's give them Judicial War!
[02:48:46.469 --> 02:48:48.890]  I mean, you people keep wanting to fight with America!
[02:48:49.191 --> 02:48:52.713]  Haven't you globalists and all your servants and all you fake liberals figured it out?
[02:48:52.993 --> 02:48:54.915]  We are kicking your asses!
[02:48:55.395 --> 02:48:56.936]  And we're gonna go on winning!
[02:48:57.116 --> 02:48:59.137]  Cause the Sleeping Giant's here, baby!
[02:48:59.898 --> 02:49:00.879]  And we will break you!
[02:49:01.559 --> 02:49:03.080]  It's like I told the enemy the other day.
[02:49:03.561 --> 02:49:04.682]  Now, get the other one.
[02:49:04.922 --> 02:49:05.802]  Even Chris Matthews.
[02:49:05.822 --> 02:49:06.343]  Go ahead and tell them.
[02:49:06.783 --> 02:49:08.985]  As you said, even Chris Matthews with MSNBC.
[02:49:09.005 --> 02:49:10.746]  Now, of course, CNN has said, oh, this is wonderful.
[02:49:11.007 --> 02:49:18.733]  James Comey was so credible, yet Chris Matthews said the Trump-Russia collusion theory just came apart with the Comey testimony.
[02:49:19.393 --> 02:49:21.715]  Exactly what I said in the first hour, because it's true!
[02:49:21.935 --> 02:49:23.036]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[02:49:23.296 --> 02:49:27.920]  The other thing, too, Alex, is that he goes back and he memorializes, as he says, on his personal computer.
[02:49:28.140 --> 02:49:32.624]  He had just investigated Hillary Clinton for having her own personal computer that wasn't secure.
[02:49:32.885 --> 02:49:34.086]  That was aside from all this.
[02:49:34.286 --> 02:49:37.069]  He has a work computer where he can memorialize this stuff.
[02:49:37.109 --> 02:49:38.830]  He doesn't have to have it classified.
[02:49:38.850 --> 02:49:39.411]  It's illegal.
[02:49:39.491 --> 02:49:39.871]  Exactly.
[02:49:39.931 --> 02:49:40.512]  And then it will.
[02:49:40.532 --> 02:49:41.473]  You just said it.
[02:49:41.533 --> 02:49:45.257]  Him keeping this memo is just like Hillary having her own private server.
[02:49:45.357 --> 02:49:46.017]  Yes.
[02:49:46.057 --> 02:49:47.399]  He had his own private server.
[02:49:47.519 --> 02:49:47.719]  Yes.
[02:49:48.019 --> 02:49:48.320]  Exactly.
[02:49:48.340 --> 02:49:49.661]  Comey had his own private server!
[02:49:49.901 --> 02:49:56.182]  Yeah, except we don't know if he did that memo at that time or if he just did it just before he leaked it to the New York Times.
[02:49:56.222 --> 02:49:57.723]  We don't know when he created this stuff.
[02:49:57.743 --> 02:50:04.604]  There's no way that we can know when he recorded, when he wrote this stuff down because he didn't do it in... You know what's happening?
[02:50:04.624 --> 02:50:05.284]  You know what's happening?
[02:50:05.544 --> 02:50:10.125]  The real deep state, the American people of every race, color and creed, Americana striking back.
[02:50:10.345 --> 02:50:13.346]  The real deep states striking back at the deep state right now.
[02:50:13.546 --> 02:50:13.666]  Yeah.
[02:50:13.846 --> 02:50:16.388]  I'm Deep State, 1836-1776, baby.
[02:50:16.688 --> 02:50:19.191]  I'm Deep State, and so is David Knight, and so is this whole crew.
[02:50:19.371 --> 02:50:20.071]  We love you all.
[02:50:20.392 --> 02:50:21.392]  Steven, take us out to break.
[02:50:21.413 --> 02:50:22.033]  Final comments.
[02:50:23.554 --> 02:50:28.719]  Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, the Bible talks about those whose conscience is seared as with a hot iron.
[02:50:28.899 --> 02:50:31.661]  You know, these people, they couldn't spell truth.
[02:50:31.701 --> 02:50:37.426]  I mean, they just lie through their teeth, and they get off on it, because I really believe they've got no conscience.
[02:50:37.626 --> 02:50:38.387]  You know, they say that
[02:50:38.840 --> 02:50:41.461]  You know, talk about, you know, every man has his price.
[02:50:41.721 --> 02:50:43.561]  Well, not the man who sold out.
[02:50:43.941 --> 02:50:44.422]  No, no, that's right.
[02:50:44.462 --> 02:50:46.842]  I've talked to top psychiatrists that have interviewed the big serial killers.
[02:50:46.882 --> 02:50:48.963]  They all have no emotion until they do bad.
[02:50:49.263 --> 02:50:50.903]  They only live by doing bad.
[02:50:51.244 --> 02:50:51.664]  We'll be back.
[02:50:51.704 --> 02:50:52.124]  Stay with us.
[02:50:52.144 --> 02:50:52.564]  More calls.
[02:50:59.406 --> 02:51:01.006]  Let's go to Manchester.
[02:51:01.386 --> 02:51:04.407]  We're reporting from the ground is Tommy Robinson.
[02:51:04.967 --> 02:51:05.568]  Tommy, wow.
[02:51:05.588 --> 02:51:06.888]  Tell us what you're doing, where you're going.
[02:51:08.218 --> 02:51:19.064]  Um, so we're walking through the city and, um, we're here today, during the day, you'll be able to see the videos going up on Red Bull, um, where there was, there was, there was prompt scares everywhere.
[02:51:19.084 --> 02:51:20.325]  People were running through the shopping centres.
[02:51:21.085 --> 02:51:24.347]  Even now, I think if a balloon went off, the whole city would run from fear.
[02:51:24.767 --> 02:51:25.628]  And there's a vigil.
[02:51:25.948 --> 02:51:34.653]  So, organised by Andy Burnham, who is the MP who is working with the Muslim extremist group, who shares a platform with them, he's organising the vigil.
[02:51:35.572 --> 02:51:37.333]  He's now the mayor of Manchester.
[02:51:37.353 --> 02:51:39.715]  He's in charge of the whole peaceful.
[02:51:40.575 --> 02:51:42.537]  He's organized a vigil for people to come together.
[02:51:42.557 --> 02:51:44.078]  This is one of the vigils which you see across.
[02:51:44.158 --> 02:51:45.619]  And so he can be the hero.
[02:51:45.939 --> 02:51:47.140]  He can know the peace.
[02:51:47.180 --> 02:51:48.380]  Let's run up white flags.
[02:51:48.681 --> 02:51:49.661]  Let me be your boss.
[02:51:49.701 --> 02:51:50.782]  Just lay down.
[02:51:51.082 --> 02:51:52.783]  Let us put the handcuffs on.
[02:51:53.064 --> 02:51:54.384]  Get in the yellow Volkswagen.
[02:51:54.665 --> 02:51:55.785]  Let us get you in the basement.
[02:51:56.206 --> 02:51:56.506]  Go ahead.
[02:51:57.677 --> 02:51:57.997]  That's it.
[02:51:58.337 --> 02:51:59.157]  That's it.
[02:51:59.257 --> 02:52:01.358]  And that's what... I didn't even know this.
[02:52:01.398 --> 02:52:04.259]  I've only just started researching Manchester since I got up this morning.
[02:52:04.999 --> 02:52:08.860]  And again, just... I've only had to scratch beneath the surface.
[02:52:08.880 --> 02:52:11.620]  It took me 10 minutes to find things out.
[02:52:11.640 --> 02:52:17.221]  10 minutes to find things out, but I believe now this is one of these vigils where... It doesn't do anything, does it?
[02:52:17.842 --> 02:52:19.402]  I understand the feeling of coming together.
[02:52:20.160 --> 02:52:25.902]  It's not gonna... But it makes the people that allowed it to happen look like they care about everybody on the conciliators.
[02:52:25.922 --> 02:52:27.222]  They're the people standing up there.
[02:52:27.582 --> 02:52:33.324]  As I said, my mum was an immigrant to this country and she embraced it and as her children we embrace it and that's the same with them.
[02:52:33.364 --> 02:52:34.984]  They've embraced it and love it.
[02:52:35.144 --> 02:52:37.005]  But there's one section of the community who don't.
[02:52:37.365 --> 02:52:39.865]  One section of immigrants who have come here who refuse to.
[02:52:40.185 --> 02:52:41.286]  Who are now third generation.
[02:52:41.306 --> 02:52:42.906]  I believe this man was second generation.
[02:52:43.386 --> 02:52:45.567]  But second and third generation, the problem is getting worse and worse.
[02:52:46.385 --> 02:52:47.206]  Problems getting worse and worse.
[02:52:47.226 --> 02:52:52.473]  The hatred, the pure hatred against our way of life, our culture, our history, everything about it.
[02:52:52.513 --> 02:52:54.175]  We've lost our identity as English people.
[02:52:54.713 --> 02:52:55.513]  We've lost our history.
[02:52:55.673 --> 02:52:57.594]  We've not been allowed to be proud in who we are.
[02:52:57.754 --> 02:52:59.195]  Proud in our history or our culture.
[02:52:59.595 --> 02:53:00.976]  So there's something missing anyway.
[02:53:01.116 --> 02:53:02.176]  So Islam fills that void.
[02:53:02.677 --> 02:53:05.338]  They've then joined Islam and they're allowed to be proud in their identity.
[02:53:06.018 --> 02:53:09.260]  And they're given a real strong sense of belief and identity and belonging.
[02:53:09.860 --> 02:53:10.760]  Which has been lost.
[02:53:10.860 --> 02:53:11.501]  Purposely lost.
[02:53:12.141 --> 02:53:12.701]  Orchestrated.
[02:53:12.921 --> 02:53:13.602]  They've done that on purpose.
[02:53:14.242 --> 02:53:16.623]  I said most English kids who are 16 walking around with their heads down.
[02:53:16.643 --> 02:53:18.264]  Walking around with their heads down.
[02:53:18.979 --> 02:53:23.442]  So they take culture away and then bring in either leftist globalism or Islam.
[02:53:23.743 --> 02:53:25.424]  Why do you think the left is so allied?
[02:53:25.744 --> 02:53:29.367]  Again, Tommy Robinson on the ground in Manchester investigating live.
[02:53:29.787 --> 02:53:33.230]  Why do you think that the left is so allied with Islam?
[02:53:34.984 --> 02:53:40.127]  I always say, it's the Marxists and Communists aligning with Islam, and they both hate each other.
[02:53:40.387 --> 02:53:41.568]  But they're simply using each other.
[02:53:42.328 --> 02:53:42.928]  Yay!
[02:53:42.988 --> 02:53:44.429]  Let's run up the white flag!
[02:53:44.469 --> 02:53:45.610]  Yay!
[02:53:45.910 --> 02:53:50.632]  Let's have the very people that ran up the white flag come and lead us into more bondage!
[02:53:50.733 --> 02:53:51.033]  Yes!
[02:54:11.531 --> 02:54:12.352]  So good to be alive.
[02:54:40.891 --> 02:54:43.311]  And it comes out, and they're keeping the babies alive?
[02:54:43.351 --> 02:54:44.532]  I told you that 20 years ago.
[02:54:44.932 --> 02:54:45.872]  Now it's mainstream news?
[02:54:46.372 --> 02:54:47.472]  I'm pissed off!
[02:54:49.013 --> 02:54:51.393]  I mean, it's like people now see a woman getting mugged and do nothing.
[02:54:51.793 --> 02:54:52.453]  I'm not a hero.
[02:54:52.513 --> 02:54:53.893]  I see guys mugging some woman.
[02:54:54.174 --> 02:54:54.934]  I can't help it.
[02:54:55.454 --> 02:55:00.955]  I've got inbred switches that I turn into a killer when I see stuff like that.
[02:55:01.215 --> 02:55:03.555]  And when I see stuff like this, what do you think InfoWars is?
[02:55:03.615 --> 02:55:04.776]  It's a weapon system.
[02:55:04.936 --> 02:55:06.436]  We're attacking the globalists.
[02:55:07.136 --> 02:55:07.977]  We're in a war!
[02:55:08.037 --> 02:55:08.697]  We hate them!
[02:55:09.117 --> 02:55:10.158]  Because we love our children.
[02:55:10.198 --> 02:55:12.820]  David, I gotta plug and go to this caller, because Cole's been holding forever.
[02:55:12.840 --> 02:55:14.921]  And Chris, we'll see if Anthony Comey will let us co-host with him.
[02:55:15.161 --> 02:55:15.922]  If not, I'll punch out.
[02:55:15.942 --> 02:55:17.262]  He's a great guy who has a lot to cover.
[02:55:17.283 --> 02:55:18.543]  I don't want to mess up his agenda.
[02:55:19.244 --> 02:55:22.286]  But just briefly to that, why do you get so aggressive?
[02:55:22.466 --> 02:55:23.046]  What do you want?
[02:55:23.086 --> 02:55:23.887]  Are you on freedom?
[02:55:24.067 --> 02:55:25.127]  Are you on Jesus Christ?
[02:55:25.148 --> 02:55:26.448]  Because they always ask, what am I on?
[02:55:26.769 --> 02:55:28.670]  I'm on not being a devil worshipper!
[02:55:29.270 --> 02:55:39.897]  Yeah, I did a report the other night, Alex, the difference between Islam and Christianity, and I talked about this gleeful terrorist who was the happiest, everybody said, oh, he's the happiest I've ever seen him, the day he was going out to mass murder people.
[02:55:40.117 --> 02:55:45.581]  And then there was the bouncer, Ozzy, at one of the bars, the guy who fought him off with his bare hands, throwing stuff at him.
[02:55:46.221 --> 02:55:47.042]  He took on three of them!
[02:55:47.222 --> 02:55:49.783]  Yeah, this is a guy who first, his instinct was to run.
[02:55:49.823 --> 02:55:50.803]  He didn't want to get in a fight.
[02:55:51.003 --> 02:55:52.164]  The guy had a suicide vest.
[02:55:52.484 --> 02:55:56.705]  But then he came after him because he said, if I don't do something, innocent people are going to die.
[02:55:57.005 --> 02:56:04.187]  That's the difference, folks, between Islam and Christianity, between the cultures and the societies that those two religions create.
[02:56:04.408 --> 02:56:05.788]  And that's the essence of it, Alex.
[02:56:05.828 --> 02:56:07.028]  Yeah, scroll down, he got stabbed.
[02:56:07.048 --> 02:56:09.029]  The whole back of his neck slashed him, all in the arms.
[02:56:09.049 --> 02:56:15.992]  You know what they say, he reportedly kicked at least two of their asses and held them off before they killed another five, six people for the cops to get there.
[02:56:16.232 --> 02:56:18.813]  When he first saw him, they were stabbing repeatedly a woman.
[02:56:18.933 --> 02:56:19.473]  In the face!
[02:56:19.633 --> 02:56:22.675]  Yeah, three guys stabbing a woman with a knife repeatedly.
[02:56:22.695 --> 02:56:23.775]  The three of them teaming up on her.
[02:56:23.855 --> 02:56:25.596]  And there were reportedly like 50 men in there.
[02:56:25.636 --> 02:56:29.297]  This one guy didn't, he stood up, he saw it, he just said, F you!
[02:56:29.557 --> 02:56:29.698]  Yeah.
[02:56:29.878 --> 02:56:31.058]  He committed right there.
[02:56:31.098 --> 02:56:31.938]  He said, F you!
[02:56:32.138 --> 02:56:32.519]  That's right.
[02:56:32.759 --> 02:56:33.039]  That's right.
[02:56:33.559 --> 02:56:36.020]  And so they beat him up and they ran out of the bar and then the police shot him.
[02:56:36.280 --> 02:56:37.280]  So that's how that thing ended.
[02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:39.960]  He fought three guys with knives and ran them out.
[02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:40.881]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:56:41.541 --> 02:56:41.841]  That's right.
[02:56:41.861 --> 02:56:42.981]  So, you know, that's the difference.
[02:56:43.421 --> 02:56:45.102]  You have to at some point, we don't want to fight.
[02:56:45.162 --> 02:56:46.002]  Oh, he's crazy.
[02:56:46.162 --> 02:56:47.122]  Oh, he's aggressive.
[02:56:47.162 --> 02:56:48.462]  Oh my gosh, you know.
[02:56:48.622 --> 02:56:48.742]  Yeah.
[02:56:48.762 --> 02:56:52.583]  Well, that's why they bash guys that like to go to soccer games and then they get in fights if they want.
[02:56:52.643 --> 02:56:55.424]  Those are still men that have the vestigial memory of fighting.
[02:56:55.744 --> 02:56:55.864]  Yeah.
[02:56:56.744 --> 02:56:57.404]  And you know what?
[02:56:57.724 --> 02:56:58.925]  The guy will beat the living hell out of you.
[02:56:58.945 --> 02:56:59.665]  That's what it's all about.
[02:56:59.765 --> 02:57:01.105]  But we're not fighting over tribalism.
[02:57:01.125 --> 02:57:03.086]  We're fighting over saving innocent lives.
[02:57:03.106 --> 02:57:07.747]  We're fighting over our freedom, over the freedom of our children and our families and our grandchildren.
[02:57:08.067 --> 02:57:09.027]  That's what we're fighting about.
[02:57:09.047 --> 02:57:12.328]  We're fighting to save our culture, our society, our legal system.
[02:57:12.608 --> 02:57:14.089]  We're not going to run away.
[02:57:14.109 --> 02:57:15.289]  And that's the thing.
[02:57:15.309 --> 02:57:18.030]  At some point you've got to turn around and say, I'm not going to put up with this anymore.
[02:57:18.530 --> 02:57:21.191]  And then once you get committed, you get so alive.
[02:57:21.211 --> 02:57:22.992]  These people are all so dead because they're selfish.
[02:57:23.252 --> 02:57:25.172]  They want to just, oh, the best movie, the best rock concert.
[02:57:25.313 --> 02:57:26.233]  I enjoy all that, too.
[02:57:26.593 --> 02:57:31.035]  But if you're not spending a large time every day being free, you're not alive, folks.
[02:57:31.075 --> 02:57:33.215]  You're alive when you... And I know our listeners know that.
[02:57:33.475 --> 02:57:35.296]  But we've got to reach out to more zombies before I end this hour.
[02:57:36.937 --> 02:57:40.098]  I love Super Blue with the colloidal silver and the iodine and the fluoride-free, but...
[02:57:41.055 --> 02:57:46.116]  I said to my dad, who's awesome, you know, retired dentist and oral surgeon, I said, I don't like the tube we have.
[02:57:46.176 --> 02:57:49.697]  I said, I want the more classic slash space age.
[02:57:49.737 --> 02:57:51.838]  Not the really old style tubes, not the super noob tube.
[02:57:52.118 --> 02:57:54.838]  I like the classic softer tubes with the bigger, you know, bigger end on them.
[02:57:55.098 --> 02:57:56.039]  He goes, well, it's concentrated.
[02:57:56.059 --> 02:57:56.939]  You're not supposed to get that much out.
[02:57:56.959 --> 02:57:57.499]  I said, I don't care.
[02:57:57.799 --> 02:57:58.279]  I like this.
[02:57:58.319 --> 02:57:59.039]  We'll see if I'm right.
[02:57:59.259 --> 02:58:00.180]  If not, we'll go back to the old tube.
[02:58:00.460 --> 02:58:01.260]  But it's the same amount.
[02:58:01.540 --> 02:58:03.661]  Infowarslife.com has been sold out for months.
[02:58:04.021 --> 02:58:04.421]  It's back.
[02:58:04.481 --> 02:58:05.881]  The bubble gum for kids is sold out.
[02:58:05.921 --> 02:58:06.621]  Bubble gum flavor.
[02:58:06.881 --> 02:58:07.562]  It's all natural.
[02:58:07.642 --> 02:58:08.502]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:10.191 --> 02:58:14.893]  Infowarslive.com, buy a true selenium, read about selenium deficiency, and then get it from us.
[02:58:15.133 --> 02:58:19.955]  We have it off, 25% off right now, 33% off on the toothpaste, even though it's been sold out.
[02:58:20.275 --> 02:58:23.596]  Super Mel Vitality, great t-shirts, so much more.
[02:58:23.616 --> 02:58:25.717]  Soon we'll be playing clips from the contest.
[02:58:25.737 --> 02:58:26.778]  I want to play some of those tomorrow.
[02:58:27.078 --> 02:58:28.958]  Folks out exposing CNN as the enemy.
[02:58:29.279 --> 02:58:30.639]  It's all happening, but your calls.
[02:58:30.699 --> 02:58:32.580]  Cole in Alabama, Chris and Rod, I promise.
[02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:34.141]  Man, I'm too fired up.
[02:58:34.662 --> 02:58:35.002]  70 seconds.
[02:58:35.142 --> 02:58:36.024]  I am high as a kite.
[02:58:36.444 --> 02:58:41.190]  I've had two cups of coffee and Nico did bring chocolate covered and donuts.
[02:58:41.270 --> 02:58:41.911]  I did eat those.
[02:58:41.931 --> 02:58:42.872]  That's probably what this is.
[02:58:44.153 --> 02:58:47.696]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[02:58:48.157 --> 02:58:54.202]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[02:58:54.602 --> 02:58:57.405]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:57.785 --> 02:59:00.788]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:59:00.988 --> 02:59:04.431]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[02:59:04.771 --> 02:59:05.232]  The left
[02:59:05.572 --> 02:59:06.513]  ...controls culture.
[02:59:06.533 --> 02:59:07.514]  They control arts.
[02:59:07.594 --> 02:59:08.816]  They control entertainment.
[02:59:09.116 --> 02:59:16.204]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:59:16.244 --> 02:59:18.646]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[02:59:19.147 --> 02:59:23.011]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[02:59:23.051 --> 02:59:25.133]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate...
[02:59:25.734 --> 02:59:31.119]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[02:59:31.379 --> 02:59:37.624]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[02:59:37.704 --> 02:59:39.406]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[02:59:39.546 --> 02:59:40.727]  It's available right now.
[02:59:41.047 --> 02:59:43.609]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:45.311 --> 02:59:51.216]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:55.490 --> 03:00:06.139]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:06.179 --> 03:00:12.624]  Cut me, I'm alive tonight, out on the streets again.
[03:00:12.664 --> 03:00:19.570]  Turn me on, I'm a hot shot, some men never forget.
[03:00:26.914 --> 03:00:28.035]  You better set me free!
[03:00:28.055 --> 03:00:33.979]  A little bit better than I used to be, because I'm alive!
[03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:35.860]  Live wire!
[03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:38.102]  And I'm coming for you, Globalist!
[03:00:38.702 --> 03:00:41.925]  And you may defeat me, but just know this, I'm coming for you.
[03:00:41.945 --> 03:00:42.305]  24-7.
[03:00:42.805 --> 03:00:43.706]  My eyes on you.
[03:00:43.726 --> 03:00:45.867]  Let's go ahead and go to Cole in Alabama.
[03:00:45.887 --> 03:00:48.369]  You're on the air with David Knight, and of course, myself.
[03:00:51.271 --> 03:00:54.814]  Alex, David Knight, it's a great honor to be on the show with y'all, fighting the Zinfo War.
[03:00:54.954 --> 03:00:55.894]  Honor to talk to you, brother.
[03:00:55.914 --> 03:00:56.395]  What's going on?
[03:00:57.554 --> 03:00:59.216]  Yeah, so I really have two things.
[03:00:59.376 --> 03:01:04.180]  First, let me just mention, I love all the classic rock and the classic country you got going on in the intro music.
[03:01:04.280 --> 03:01:04.841]  That's awesome.
[03:01:05.281 --> 03:01:06.522]  So, I have two things.
[03:01:06.562 --> 03:01:09.284]  My first thing is with this Comey situation here.
[03:01:09.745 --> 03:01:17.232]  After watching this and paying attention to the show, paying attention to everything going on, something was revealed to me after Comey said a few words.
[03:01:17.932 --> 03:01:19.634]  He mentioned himself being a coward.
[03:01:19.654 --> 03:01:22.036]  Now, he's just trying to get off the phone, shrieking, being
[03:01:22.509 --> 03:01:22.830]  Thank you.
[03:01:35.653 --> 03:01:44.697]  Or metaphor, if you will, of Trump intimidating the deep state, how they're frantically trying to figure out what to do with him, what's done in the dark will be brought to the light.
[03:01:44.997 --> 03:01:47.418]  That's really what I want to get across through this conversation.
[03:01:47.438 --> 03:01:48.659]  That is the whole day.
[03:01:48.679 --> 03:01:50.860]  That's why I should take more calls, because they have such wisdom.
[03:01:50.880 --> 03:01:52.200]  I'm not being patronizing, it's true.
[03:01:52.561 --> 03:01:55.222]  I kept saying, why would he say, I'm weak, I'm cowardly, I'm afraid?
[03:01:55.242 --> 03:01:56.242]  We'll play that clip later.
[03:01:56.262 --> 03:01:57.163]  We played it earlier.
[03:01:57.623 --> 03:02:04.686]  Because he's signaling, I'm a poor baby, leave me alone, I don't want power, I just want money, I want to roll over, I want to give in.
[03:02:04.966 --> 03:02:06.047]  That's what elitists always say to me.
[03:02:06.087 --> 03:02:08.489]  They go, Alex, what's your number?
[03:02:08.529 --> 03:02:09.049]  What do you want?
[03:02:09.089 --> 03:02:10.110]  Just stop it.
[03:02:10.230 --> 03:02:10.710]  Just look.
[03:02:11.371 --> 03:02:11.831]  Join us.
[03:02:13.312 --> 03:02:13.813]  Come on.
[03:02:13.913 --> 03:02:14.753]  You're going to be destroyed.
[03:02:15.354 --> 03:02:17.556]  And it's the fact that they're saying that that I have to fight them.
[03:02:17.576 --> 03:02:24.921]  Not that I've got some you-know-what measuring contest, but I can't roll over to that type of person because they want to dominate the innocents before they can grow and be strong.
[03:02:25.482 --> 03:02:27.543]  These guys don't know how to cut it off with dominating other men.
[03:02:27.583 --> 03:02:29.245]  It goes on to women, children, you name it.
[03:02:29.525 --> 03:02:30.946]  That's a very deep point he just made.
[03:02:31.246 --> 03:02:31.846]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:02:31.926 --> 03:02:35.088]  Why would he brag about being a beta?
[03:02:35.128 --> 03:02:36.589]  He thinks there's some virtue in that.
[03:02:36.629 --> 03:02:37.529]  That's what these people think.
[03:02:37.829 --> 03:02:43.953]  I think one of the key things, too, coming out of this, Alex, and we'll talk about this coming up, are the revelations coming out of Grassley's letters.
[03:02:43.973 --> 03:02:44.893]  He wrote a couple of letters.
[03:02:45.273 --> 03:02:52.757]  He, like Rand Paul, is very concerned about the politicization of the intelligence service of law enforcement, and he's called it out directly.
[03:02:52.817 --> 03:02:58.580]  And also, Alex, the connections between Christopher Steele, the guy who created this dirty dossier, and James Comey.
[03:02:58.620 --> 03:02:59.701]  And that's coming up in the next segment.
[03:03:00.902 --> 03:03:11.048]  Yeah, I just have one more point, Alex, about the situation in London, if you will.
[03:03:11.068 --> 03:03:17.592]  So, you know, I pay attention to a lot of Stefan Molyneux's videos, and, you know, one video on this London attack really struck me.
[03:03:17.612 --> 03:03:19.753]  He mentioned something along these lines, okay?
[03:03:19.793 --> 03:03:25.877]  So, at one point in history, Great Britain, it ruled one-third of the world, you know?
[03:03:26.960 --> 03:03:30.462]  Britain's armies defended that aisle against the armies of Napoleon.
[03:03:30.502 --> 03:03:32.823]  And it was known as the most vicious armies there were.
[03:03:34.164 --> 03:03:35.165]  Right, exactly.
[03:03:35.205 --> 03:03:42.809]  Professional armies in Europe, I mean our country for heaven's sake, rose out of that English Parliamentary Common Law Magna Carta tradition.
[03:03:43.709 --> 03:03:53.435]  And now in the 21st century, going from one extreme as an outlaw of Europe, you have the British people in Europe itself afraid
[03:03:54.002 --> 03:03:58.941]  Of being called a two-syllable politically correct word, which is racist.
[03:03:59.676 --> 03:04:05.059]  They will bow down to their daughters, their people being trampled upon.
[03:04:05.139 --> 03:04:15.185]  To a bunch of gibbering people on welfare, 80%, 80% military aged men with huge beards and wearing nightgowns, running around, bitching at everyone.
[03:04:15.205 --> 03:04:20.769]  I mean, making their women wear beekeeper suits and wiping their ass with their hands.
[03:04:21.069 --> 03:04:23.730]  And we just give them all welfare and bow down to their asses.
[03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:24.711]  I totally agree.
[03:04:25.131 --> 03:04:25.711]  I can't take it.
[03:04:25.851 --> 03:04:31.153]  And then there's one guy out of 50 men, admittedly in a pub, beats the hell out of three guys with butcher knives.
[03:04:31.393 --> 03:04:35.554]  They all run out and be gunned down by the police that were too afraid to come in and gun them down.
[03:04:35.574 --> 03:04:37.914]  I mean, I'm not saying I'm the toughest guy around.
[03:04:37.954 --> 03:04:40.035]  I've had my ass kicked plenty of times where I grew up in Texas.
[03:04:40.075 --> 03:04:42.115]  If you look at somebody wrong, they're going to try to kill you.
[03:04:42.555 --> 03:04:47.537]  I mean, I don't understand this thing of like... I gotta tell you, it's the craziest thing.
[03:04:47.797 --> 03:04:48.677]  I appreciate your call.
[03:04:48.777 --> 03:04:51.458]  Chris, I know this is where we get your calls, but this is Anthony Comey's hour.
[03:04:51.498 --> 03:04:52.058]  He's coming up.
[03:04:55.692 --> 03:04:56.873]  Michael Schneider is our guest.
[03:04:57.234 --> 03:04:58.675]  I wasn't going to get him on about these stories.
[03:04:58.735 --> 03:05:04.721]  Baltimore has become a rotting, decaying war zone as raging opioid epidemic eats away at the city like a cancer.
[03:05:05.422 --> 03:05:13.290]  Thousands flee Chicago, drugs linked to this, for safer areas of the country as America's third largest city becomes a gang-infested wasteland.
[03:05:13.450 --> 03:05:17.154]  Yeah, a couple days ago I wrote an article which went viral on Drudge Report.
[03:05:17.174 --> 03:05:29.866]  It was posted on Drudge Report, got a ton of attention about Chicago, the third largest city in America, once one of the greatest cities in the world, has descended into and basically becoming a total nightmare.
[03:05:30.026 --> 03:05:33.890]  Gang members outnumber the police in Chicago by more than a 12 to 1 margin.
[03:05:35.391 --> 03:05:44.674]  And it's thanks to unchecked illegal immigration, the Latin American gangs coming across the border are just pouring into places like Chicago and creating violence like crazy.
[03:05:44.694 --> 03:05:50.056]  In fact, just this week, the Chicago police issued an alert telling every member of the Chicago police force
[03:05:50.536 --> 03:05:53.157]  About the high-powered weapons that the gangs are using.
[03:05:53.857 --> 03:05:56.318]  Because they're just not using, you know, little pop guns.
[03:05:56.358 --> 03:05:59.279]  They're using automatic weapons in many cases.
[03:05:59.739 --> 03:06:01.360]  And so Chicago's totally out of control.
[03:06:01.380 --> 03:06:02.420]  So people are leaving.
[03:06:02.840 --> 03:06:12.824]  In fact, last year, 2016, Cook County had lost more people through domestic migration than any other county in America.
[03:06:12.844 --> 03:06:13.984]  Because people are getting out.
[03:06:14.584 --> 03:06:22.129]  And in one recent year, 2015, 3,000 millionaires, millionaires left the city of Chicago for other places.
[03:06:22.169 --> 03:06:30.754]  So people are fleeing, they're getting out, they don't want to raise their families where there's so much violence, so much crime, where things are completely out of control.
[03:06:30.954 --> 03:06:41.281]  If we see crime exploding in Chicago, the murder rate increases 60% last year, while the economy is still relatively stable, what's going to happen if we have a major downturn?
[03:06:41.801 --> 03:06:48.923]  Because, you know, right now, Alex, the number of retail bankruptcies has already surpassed all of last year.
[03:06:49.483 --> 03:06:57.184]  And if we continue at the same pace that we're on, we're going to break the all-time yearly record for store closings for retail stores by more than 20%.
[03:06:57.285 --> 03:07:01.485]  We're not just going to break the record, we're going to absolutely shatter it.
[03:07:01.625 --> 03:07:05.026]  So we've got all these economic red flags going up all around us.
[03:07:05.386 --> 03:07:08.167]  These trends started under Obama, so Obama should get the blame.
[03:07:08.527 --> 03:07:10.128]  That's right, we've had a 50 year rot of America.
[03:07:30.424 --> 03:07:35.186]  We have brought in giant third world populations that have no history of living in a free country or being upwardly mobile.
[03:07:35.206 --> 03:07:36.106]  They're put on welfare.
[03:07:36.386 --> 03:07:37.326]  They're made to be liberal.
[03:07:37.546 --> 03:07:39.327]  They're made to have chips on their shoulders right away.
[03:07:39.507 --> 03:07:45.509]  Trump is desperately trying to get jobs into the areas, desperately trying to create exuberance, trying to create a good attitude.
[03:07:45.529 --> 03:07:48.850]  Everybody knows with the dollar, you name it, it's all about confidence.
[03:07:48.890 --> 03:07:53.292]  And then the media is blaming him when he's desperately trying to right the ship.
[03:07:59.867 --> 03:08:04.852]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:08:05.172 --> 03:08:07.535]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:08:08.095 --> 03:08:10.858]  My love is at lead for the freeway.
[03:08:10.878 --> 03:08:17.144]  It's a fashionable ride as the cities fly by.
[03:08:17.305 --> 03:08:22.770]  The taillights is on in the coming of the night.
[03:08:24.494 --> 03:08:26.795]  Well, Anthony Cumia is a syndicated radio host.
[03:08:26.855 --> 03:08:27.956]  I'd call him a libertarian.
[03:08:29.077 --> 03:08:31.739]  And we're getting ready to launch 18 hours a day of live broadcast.
[03:08:31.759 --> 03:08:33.880]  We're going to add a morning show and a late night show soon.
[03:08:34.601 --> 03:08:37.963]  And of course, he's got his own network and his own great work, but he's invited on any time he wants.
[03:08:38.023 --> 03:08:47.990]  Everybody should also go and actually visit his sites and his Twitter and more, because just amazing information is there at compoundmedia.com.
[03:08:49.511 --> 03:09:08.066]  We had one of his great hosts, Gavin McInnes, on for an hour earlier, and he's somebody that I'd call libertarian, who said mild stuff about cop killer groups and people, and got kicked off the number one show, arguably, it was right there with Howard Stern, off of XM, after he'd been on that for over a decade.
[03:09:08.945 --> 03:09:19.916]  And so that's why I'm so honored to have him here with us because he'll say things like, it's, you know, wrong to say that if you built your business, you didn't build that, which sounds like common sense, but that's what he was kicked off XM and traditional radio for.
[03:09:20.377 --> 03:09:24.842]  But as they kick all their big talents off, they're just killing themselves because everyone's just coming here.
[03:09:25.222 --> 03:09:26.964]  They're going to compound media.com now.
[03:09:27.344 --> 03:09:29.806]  I got to get out of here in the next 30 minutes because this is his hour.
[03:09:30.727 --> 03:09:31.627]  He does every few weeks with us.
[03:09:31.647 --> 03:09:32.288]  We appreciate it.
[03:09:32.588 --> 03:09:33.629]  Kind of beta testing things.
[03:09:34.309 --> 03:09:36.110]  We got Chris and Rod and a few other callers.
[03:09:36.130 --> 03:09:37.591]  David Knight's got a ton he wants to hit.
[03:09:37.611 --> 03:09:40.033]  A lot of it on the Nightly News tonight, but some other things we didn't cover.
[03:09:40.373 --> 03:09:41.634]  But I want to just get out of the gates.
[03:09:42.815 --> 03:09:45.617]  Anthony Comey's take, because don't agree with me if you don't.
[03:09:45.757 --> 03:09:46.678]  And I know he wouldn't anyways.
[03:09:47.378 --> 03:09:55.584]  But I don't want us to underestimate how big a self-immolation, a controlled demolition, a implosion, a
[03:09:57.321 --> 03:09:59.983]  Wrecking ball, a self-destructus was.
[03:10:00.424 --> 03:10:01.004]  He leaked.
[03:10:01.164 --> 03:10:02.505]  He let them lie about the leak.
[03:10:02.806 --> 03:10:03.827]  He perjured himself.
[03:10:04.167 --> 03:10:05.648]  Trump didn't do any of the things they said.
[03:10:06.329 --> 03:10:06.909]  On and on.
[03:10:07.009 --> 03:10:09.872]  He followed orders from Lynch to shut down investigations.
[03:10:09.912 --> 03:10:10.752]  That's what that means.
[03:10:11.153 --> 03:10:13.995]  I mean, this was unbelievable.
[03:10:14.456 --> 03:10:16.637]  And he looked like he'd been run over by a car when he left.
[03:10:17.098 --> 03:10:19.019]  The enemies of Trump looked like they'd been punched in the stomach.
[03:10:19.360 --> 03:10:21.742]  Anthony Cumia, what do you make of the hearings?
[03:10:22.879 --> 03:10:30.882]  Oh my god, I watched it with great interest and excitement, and yeah, I do agree with you on that.
[03:10:30.982 --> 03:10:34.443]  He did get, well, his ass handed to him.
[03:10:35.743 --> 03:10:45.487]  But, oh my goodness, if you go to social media, or go to some of the mainstream media, most of the mainstream media, you will think you watched a completely different thing.
[03:10:46.267 --> 03:10:56.214]  I mean, I don't understand how people can watch the same thing and get completely different opposing viewpoints of what they just watched.
[03:10:56.574 --> 03:10:58.435]  I'm still hearing people saying, well, this is it.
[03:10:58.795 --> 03:11:03.158]  This is the beginning of the impeachment process for Donald Trump.
[03:11:03.518 --> 03:11:04.099]  That's it.
[03:11:04.559 --> 03:11:06.260]  Oh, Comey sunk him today.
[03:11:06.660 --> 03:11:07.561]  Thank goodness.
[03:11:07.841 --> 03:11:08.982]  It'll all be over soon.
[03:11:09.462 --> 03:11:13.125]  And I'm arguing with people going, where is one shred of evidence?
[03:11:14.116 --> 03:11:21.141]  That there was collusion or obstruction of justice or anything else they want to come up with.
[03:11:21.302 --> 03:11:28.207]  I love how they use, whenever the Democrats are up there at these hearings, you hear things like, well how did you feel?
[03:11:28.907 --> 03:11:29.688]  How did you feel?
[03:11:30.068 --> 03:11:33.951]  What was your interpretation of what happened that day?
[03:11:33.971 --> 03:11:35.813]  What did he mean when that?
[03:11:37.994 --> 03:11:41.058]  And the Republicans will say, well, here's a transcript of your notes.
[03:11:41.699 --> 03:11:47.525]  And I quote, Donald Trump said, I hope we can get this out of the way or take care of this.
[03:11:48.426 --> 03:11:57.677]  So you're looking at facts versus raw liberal emotion that we know over the course of the years is a fantasy world.
[03:11:58.177 --> 03:12:00.018]  They are in fantasy land.
[03:12:00.519 --> 03:12:05.082]  When they watch something, they see and interpret it how they want to.
[03:12:05.403 --> 03:12:11.627]  So, when the mainstream media feeds these people, they feed them like chickens.
[03:12:12.048 --> 03:12:15.330]  They just start feeding them outright lies.
[03:12:15.831 --> 03:12:18.253]  Just lies about what they just watched.
[03:12:18.273 --> 03:12:19.173]  And let's be clear.
[03:12:19.193 --> 03:12:20.094]  Let's be clear.
[03:12:20.715 --> 03:12:22.396]  We are not being delusional here.
[03:12:22.756 --> 03:12:24.257]  When stuff's bad, we'll say it.
[03:12:24.598 --> 03:12:26.099]  But I totally agree with Anthony Cumia.
[03:12:26.620 --> 03:12:30.697]  Of compound media because that's what they do.
[03:12:31.994 --> 03:12:34.636]  I mean, he admits the President didn't order him to do that.
[03:12:34.676 --> 03:12:36.538]  He admits they were reported wrong in the memo.
[03:12:36.858 --> 03:12:38.480]  He contradicts his other testimony.
[03:12:38.520 --> 03:12:39.481]  He admits he leaked.
[03:12:39.661 --> 03:12:40.742]  All of this is bombshell.
[03:12:41.042 --> 03:12:42.744]  He admits that Loretta Lynch did all this.
[03:12:43.524 --> 03:12:45.266]  This is a huge defeat by any yardstick.
[03:12:45.286 --> 03:12:49.149]  And even old liberals like Chris Matthews say this is the end of the Russian narrative.
[03:12:49.189 --> 03:12:49.970]  It imploded today.
[03:12:50.210 --> 03:12:55.355]  But you're right, online and even CNN, they're declaring this is a giant victory.
[03:12:55.395 --> 03:12:58.898]  Hell, they might come out and say that Germany won World War II, Anthony.
[03:13:00.168 --> 03:13:05.210]  Yeah, I really don't get that mindset.
[03:13:05.590 --> 03:13:07.731]  You saw the Patriots lost the Super Bowl last year.
[03:13:08.992 --> 03:13:25.660]  Yeah, I find it so frustrating when you go on social media and realize that there are so many people just roped in to this liberal narrative that the mainstream media throws out there that this was a horrible day for Donald Trump.
[03:13:25.960 --> 03:13:28.221]  They'll take a quote like, well,
[03:13:28.741 --> 03:13:34.504]  I guess Mueller's going to have to decide whether any crimes were committed.
[03:13:34.984 --> 03:13:36.285]  Obstruction or anything like that.
[03:13:36.705 --> 03:13:41.108]  And they take that as like, well, obstruction's still on the table.
[03:13:41.148 --> 03:13:41.588]  No, you're right.
[03:13:41.628 --> 03:13:42.448]  That's sort of the talking point.
[03:13:42.508 --> 03:13:45.510]  He's not the FBI director anymore and has no say over it.
[03:13:45.770 --> 03:13:50.032]  So why would he comment on how this whole thing is going to turn out?
[03:13:50.152 --> 03:13:51.373]  They run with that.
[03:13:51.753 --> 03:13:54.295]  They run with it as if it's still on the table.
[03:13:55.145 --> 03:13:55.665]  No, that's right.
[03:13:55.705 --> 03:13:56.905]  In fact, you've got the talking point right.
[03:13:57.446 --> 03:13:59.146]  That's the new talking point everywhere is.
[03:14:00.006 --> 03:14:03.727]  Impeachment on the table, obstruction on the table, Russia narrative move forward.
[03:14:03.947 --> 03:14:09.549]  It just got blown to kingdom come in front of everybody, and then they spin it and turn it around into that.
[03:14:09.649 --> 03:14:11.849]  Anthony, how long can this go on?
[03:14:11.869 --> 03:14:14.790]  Because I see the people really turning against this narrative now.
[03:14:15.603 --> 03:14:16.543]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:14:16.764 --> 03:14:24.947]  Within the first five minutes of the hearings, he had said that Donald Trump was told he was not under investigation.
[03:14:25.187 --> 03:14:28.729]  This is something we had been lied to about on mainstream media.
[03:14:28.749 --> 03:14:36.012]  A million times they said that Comey is leaking, that he did never tell Trump that he was not under investigation, and it's confirmed!
[03:14:36.193 --> 03:14:37.153]  That's another bombshell!
[03:14:37.273 --> 03:14:37.613]  That's right.
[03:14:37.933 --> 03:14:38.974]  He confirmed it multiple times.
[03:14:39.975 --> 03:14:44.459]  He said there's no evidence of any collusion with Donald Trump.
[03:14:45.300 --> 03:14:51.265]  It was just, he threw it all out there, like you said, a bombshell, and they just won't listen to it.
[03:14:51.606 --> 03:14:55.369]  It bounces right off their eardrums, and whatever they want to hear,
[03:14:56.510 --> 03:14:57.291]  That's what they hear.
[03:14:57.531 --> 03:15:00.133]  And yes, this will go on for some time.
[03:15:00.453 --> 03:15:06.517]  I see too many people out there in public that just will not accept what's going on.
[03:15:06.797 --> 03:15:08.999]  He was elected President of the United States.
[03:15:09.259 --> 03:15:14.282]  He will be President of the United States until 2020 and perhaps longer.
[03:15:14.762 --> 03:15:15.483]  And that's it.
[03:15:15.883 --> 03:15:16.924]  That's all you have.
[03:15:16.944 --> 03:15:23.048]  And you think they'll be successful rolling out The Rock or the head of Facebook, Zuckerberg, to defeat him?
[03:15:25.316 --> 03:15:26.457]  Oh yeah, well, you know what?
[03:15:27.478 --> 03:15:31.761]  It's interesting that so many people now are changing their attitudes.
[03:15:32.021 --> 03:15:36.144]  And the right and conservatives and alt-media are coming out and saying things.
[03:15:36.324 --> 03:15:39.927]  Finally, they are not just going, well, I'll go to work.
[03:15:40.367 --> 03:15:42.469]  Or, well, I'll take care of my kids and raise my family.
[03:15:42.809 --> 03:15:45.991]  Now they feel motivated, like, no, we have to do something.
[03:15:46.191 --> 03:15:51.595]  And I think that's why you see people like Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher getting some pushback now.
[03:15:51.936 --> 03:15:53.497]  We just used to sit down and go,
[03:15:54.077 --> 03:15:54.778]  Ah, alright.
[03:15:55.178 --> 03:16:01.944]  I know stuff like this happens, but when the left would go after people and get them fired, as we all know.
[03:16:02.895 --> 03:16:03.315]  That's right.
[03:16:03.715 --> 03:16:05.896]  Anthony Cumia is hosting the Sauer Lettuce Coast with him.
[03:16:05.916 --> 03:16:09.338]  I want to get a few of these calls out of the way and I'm going to skip this break so we have more time.
[03:16:09.698 --> 03:16:14.720]  David Knight's got some clips he wants to play and get your take on, but pulling back from this, I've got the clips right here.
[03:16:15.120 --> 03:16:17.301]  Loretta Lynch, influence, he admitted that happened.
[03:16:18.101 --> 03:16:21.963]  He went on to admit the New York Times expanded and exaggerated and made up the Russian narrative.
[03:16:22.003 --> 03:16:22.683]  It's not true.
[03:16:23.043 --> 03:16:25.004]  He said, I'm weak, I'm cowardly, I'm afraid.
[03:16:25.845 --> 03:16:28.806]  Why do you think he would make bizarre comments, Anthony Cumia, about himself like that?
[03:16:29.614 --> 03:16:43.960]  This is to get an image like, you know, hey, I'm awake and tired and I'm... He's trying to be like Tom Hanks or, you know, that whole gosh darn it kind of a guy, likable.
[03:16:44.241 --> 03:16:47.302]  He's one of the biggest camera whores I've ever seen.
[03:16:47.622 --> 03:16:51.304]  He loves being in the news and in front of a camera.
[03:16:51.544 --> 03:16:53.465]  And I think if he looks like he's
[03:16:54.165 --> 03:16:57.486]  Well, he's catering to the beta males out there.
[03:16:57.926 --> 03:16:59.467]  All the males on the left.
[03:16:59.627 --> 03:17:01.207]  That's exactly what we thought.
[03:17:01.247 --> 03:17:05.848]  I mean, if some guy like him toddled over and was going, Lordy, lordy, how you doing?
[03:17:05.888 --> 03:17:08.689]  I'd think serial killer, con artist, get away from this guy quick.
[03:17:08.929 --> 03:17:11.090]  I mean, the way he talks and acts, I would run.
[03:17:12.412 --> 03:17:13.893]  I mean, who would hang out and have a beer with this guy?
[03:17:13.913 --> 03:17:14.894]  Would you hang out with this guy?
[03:17:14.914 --> 03:17:16.456]  Would you buy a used car from Comey?
[03:17:17.536 --> 03:17:19.018]  No, absolutely not.
[03:17:19.618 --> 03:17:25.443]  Although he would make a good used car salesman because there are a lot of rubes out there that are buying his line.
[03:17:26.204 --> 03:17:29.507]  Alright, now let's get into the big enchilada issue here.
[03:17:29.567 --> 03:17:30.728]  What should happen to Comey?
[03:17:31.108 --> 03:17:35.712]  USA Today says Trump's lawyer says James Comey made unauthorized disclosures of privileged talks.
[03:17:35.732 --> 03:17:37.854]  Yeah, it was illegal, but that's not what's even big.
[03:17:38.294 --> 03:17:42.882]  He didn't give it to the DOJ if he was so disturbed and thought it might be criminal.
[03:17:43.042 --> 03:17:47.169]  He says it isn't criminal now, but he kept it for himself like Hillary's private server.
[03:17:49.045 --> 03:17:51.046]  Yeah, why wouldn't you say something?
[03:17:51.407 --> 03:17:56.470]  Obviously, if he thought there was a problem, you would want to convey that through the proper channels.
[03:17:56.770 --> 03:17:57.671]  He didn't do that.
[03:17:59.452 --> 03:18:01.053]  Again, more interpretation.
[03:18:01.313 --> 03:18:16.864]  Well, Trump said this, so I think, what I assume he meant, without any basis besides a guy that, by the way, just got fired, so he's not going to hold his boss in the best light possible.
[03:18:19.486 --> 03:18:29.720]  I think yes, something should have, there should be some type of, I hate all these investigations, but someone should look into why he didn't say something.
[03:18:30.100 --> 03:18:36.729]  And again, look into the whole Hillary and Bill Clinton and Lynch on the runway and all that other stuff.
[03:18:36.809 --> 03:18:50.736]  The Marco Rubio clip where he said, boy, you sure leaked everything but the fact that Trump was innocent, we now learn, and that you're confirming that Trump never, you know, asked you to stop anything, and that you did tell him that he wasn't under investigation.
[03:18:51.036 --> 03:18:55.358]  Everything that the media has been lying for all these months now is all confirmed, but no headlines.
[03:18:55.619 --> 03:18:56.759]  Trump vindicated.
[03:18:57.159 --> 03:18:58.180]  Comey disgraced.
[03:18:58.240 --> 03:18:58.860]  Where are the headlines?
[03:18:59.300 --> 03:19:03.963]  Alex, it came apart, as Chris Matthews said, because of what you just said, and also because he said,
[03:19:04.583 --> 03:19:08.524]  He revealed that Flynn wasn't central to the Russian investigation.
[03:19:08.604 --> 03:19:10.724]  That's another key thing that came out of this.
[03:19:10.784 --> 03:19:12.184]  And so, yeah, there's nothing there.
[03:19:12.384 --> 03:19:16.465]  And now you've got Chris Matthews saying, if that's not the case, where's the there?
[03:19:16.585 --> 03:19:16.785]  There.
[03:19:16.845 --> 03:19:18.285]  In other words, this is a nothing burger.
[03:19:18.325 --> 03:19:20.566]  We even had a cartoon on our website yesterday.
[03:19:20.606 --> 03:19:21.866]  We had Hillary Clinton.
[03:19:22.046 --> 03:19:22.386]  It's a hoax.
[03:19:22.406 --> 03:19:23.146]  Hillary Clinton's, right?
[03:19:23.246 --> 03:19:25.667]  And there she opens up the burger and there's nothing there.
[03:19:26.027 --> 03:19:27.627]  And she said, would you like lies with that?
[03:19:27.827 --> 03:19:28.347]  Like fries?
[03:19:28.387 --> 03:19:30.207]  Let me ask you this, and then get into your other point in these calls.
[03:19:30.487 --> 03:19:33.248]  How do they get punished for this hoax?
[03:19:33.908 --> 03:19:38.776]  This giant hoax, this huge lie, I guess the media just declares victory and moves on?
[03:19:39.837 --> 03:19:43.082]  I think Grassley is on to him, Alex.
[03:19:43.122 --> 03:19:44.284]  There's the cartoon, you can see that.
[03:19:44.464 --> 03:19:45.446]  I think Grassley is on to him.
[03:19:45.626 --> 03:19:47.629]  I think a key thing here is the dirty dossier.
[03:19:47.950 --> 03:19:48.651]  Christopher Steele.
[03:19:49.372 --> 03:19:52.134]  Grassley said, and this was in a letter that he sent March 16th.
[03:19:52.154 --> 03:19:59.139]  He got this guy in England that pulls out of his rear end that Trump likes to be pee-peed on with no evidence and it's been proven to be discredited.
[03:19:59.459 --> 03:20:08.024]  He says the idea that the FBI would pay this guy, that associates of the Clinton campaign would pay this guy, raises substantial questions about the FBI's independence from politics.
[03:20:08.065 --> 03:20:10.866]  He wrote this to Comey the beginning of March.
[03:20:10.906 --> 03:20:18.031]  He said, as well as, raises questions as well as, on the Obama administration's use of law enforcement and intelligence agencies for political ends.
[03:20:18.051 --> 03:20:18.992]  Now he didn't get a reply.
[03:20:19.612 --> 03:20:22.073]  Feinstein sent a letter to him and said, we're concerned about this as well.
[03:20:22.253 --> 03:20:22.733]  He didn't reply.
[03:20:22.753 --> 03:20:24.694]  Instead, he sent a four-sentence letter back.
[03:20:25.374 --> 03:20:29.115]  And so then he got a multiple-page letter coming back from Grassley saying, you didn't send that to me.
[03:20:29.135 --> 03:20:30.136]  You just gave me four sentences.
[03:20:30.476 --> 03:20:33.957]  Two of those are simply boilerplate closers for any FBI thing.
[03:20:34.137 --> 03:20:35.998]  And he says, we need to know what's going on here, Seth.
[03:20:36.218 --> 03:20:45.121]  There are material inconsistencies between the description of the FBI's relationship with Mr. Steele that you provide in your briefing and information contained in the Justice Department documents.
[03:20:45.481 --> 03:20:47.002]  And so he asked him specific questions.
[03:20:47.042 --> 03:20:51.985]  He said, uh, document please for me all payments that you made to Mr. Steele, including for travel expenses.
[03:20:52.305 --> 03:20:57.428]  Document to me when the FBI was in contact with Mr. Steele or otherwise, relying on information in the dossier.
[03:20:57.948 --> 03:21:04.732]  Was it aware that his employer, Fusion GPS, was allegedly simultaneously working as an unregistered agent for Russian interests?
[03:21:04.752 --> 03:21:06.353]  I'll talk about this more on the nightly news tonight.
[03:21:06.573 --> 03:21:08.655]  By the way, I was told... He understands.
[03:21:09.015 --> 03:21:09.695]  This was the real thing.
[03:21:09.795 --> 03:21:12.537]  Flynn is just talking to a Russian ambassador as part of the transition.
[03:21:12.757 --> 03:21:13.538]  I know we have limited time.
[03:21:14.019 --> 03:21:15.761]  You're talking faster than I am, but this is important.
[03:21:15.901 --> 03:21:17.664]  We don't want to take up his time, but let me explain.
[03:21:18.565 --> 03:21:23.252]  I was told by State Department and CIA sources that I don't want to get into on air, okay?
[03:21:23.852 --> 03:21:26.396]  But I mean, we've said this, we've done this, we have our sources.
[03:21:26.436 --> 03:21:27.658]  Hell, I talk to the President sometimes.
[03:21:28.923 --> 03:21:35.887]  And they said, Alex, believe me, you're totally off in left field, even defending Trump, saying he's, you know, not with the Russians.
[03:21:35.927 --> 03:21:40.510]  You understand, Hillary literally was on their payroll because they thought she was going to win.
[03:21:40.530 --> 03:21:44.713]  And all these dossiers and things are through the Russians.
[03:21:44.953 --> 03:21:45.173]  Yes.
[03:21:45.513 --> 03:21:46.334]  On Pisgah.
[03:21:46.694 --> 03:21:46.974]  Exactly.
[03:21:47.094 --> 03:21:47.654]  And all this.
[03:21:47.694 --> 03:21:50.596]  And I just said, these are multiple, these are like high level people.
[03:21:50.816 --> 03:21:51.257]  We're talking
[03:21:52.117 --> 03:21:53.618]  High level generals above Flynn.
[03:22:08.167 --> 03:22:09.788]  To be anti-Russian one way or the other?
[03:22:09.808 --> 03:22:17.534]  No, they later explained, watch, and now Grassley's come out, we learned, months ago, and it's true that the Russians were double-betting, which any government would do.
[03:22:17.574 --> 03:22:18.915]  We're not anti-Russia, it's just a fact.
[03:22:19.295 --> 03:22:28.722]  And that's why the Clintons were so scared once they lost, is because they know they've been on the Russian payroll, so they've got to accuse Trump of what they've done, and then all the proof's there.
[03:22:28.762 --> 03:22:30.423]  Let's go to Anthony Comey on that.
[03:22:30.843 --> 03:22:31.504]  Covering their butts.
[03:22:31.664 --> 03:22:32.604]  Oh my God.
[03:22:33.065 --> 03:22:33.385]  Yeah.
[03:22:34.526 --> 03:22:45.393]  Boy, we sure saw a double standard between the way Hillary was treated by Comey and the way Trump and his people are being treated by Comey.
[03:22:46.673 --> 03:22:48.214]  What I see there also is
[03:22:49.415 --> 03:22:52.858]  Why does Comey get a pass?
[03:22:53.358 --> 03:23:08.289]  Why doesn't he have to answer for calling off the investigation or wrapping up the investigation on Hillary Clinton when we had real evidence there of things like collusion, corruption?
[03:23:08.309 --> 03:23:11.952]  Yeah, the guy creating the Piscate Gossier is on the Russian payroll.
[03:23:11.972 --> 03:23:12.532]  That's right.
[03:23:12.592 --> 03:23:12.833]  Right?
[03:23:12.893 --> 03:23:13.193]  That's right.
[03:23:14.053 --> 03:23:23.198]  And as far as Flynn goes, people actually think Flynn was in trouble because of colluding with the Russians.
[03:23:23.498 --> 03:23:27.120]  No, he was well within his business to speak to the Russians.
[03:23:27.460 --> 03:23:33.163]  It was the lying to the FBI that was the topic of the investigation.
[03:23:33.183 --> 03:23:34.544]  But again... But let me give you the real thing.
[03:23:34.564 --> 03:23:35.244]  He didn't fill out paperwork.
[03:23:35.264 --> 03:23:36.565]  All these people don't know what they're talking about.
[03:23:36.585 --> 03:23:36.885]  Exactly.
[03:23:36.905 --> 03:23:40.687]  And they think, they believe it's a collusion case.
[03:23:40.887 --> 03:23:41.767]  They're trying to get processed.
[03:23:41.787 --> 03:23:42.348]  Well, I knew this.
[03:23:43.268 --> 03:23:43.588]  Comey.
[03:23:43.908 --> 03:23:56.091]  I knew this before the election even ended, that Flynn was, and I know I like Flynn, great patriot, he's totally a patriot like Trump, he just was doing consulting deals with Turkey and a bunch of other places that weren't properly disclosed on paperwork because it's so complex.
[03:23:56.371 --> 03:23:58.191]  The real reason he's gone is the Turkey thing.
[03:23:58.591 --> 03:24:02.752]  And I said that before it ever came out, it was just paperwork stuff, and Trump went on top of it.
[03:24:03.512 --> 03:24:06.233]  You've been doing lobbying not just for the U.S.
[03:24:06.253 --> 03:24:06.773]  but foreign.
[03:24:07.133 --> 03:24:09.374]  I said five-year ban on lobbyists, go.
[03:24:10.174 --> 03:24:11.094]  That's why he's gone.
[03:24:12.674 --> 03:24:13.395]  That's why he's gone.
[03:24:13.435 --> 03:24:13.955]  Let's take two calls.
[03:24:14.036 --> 03:24:16.398]  I'm going to get out of here and let Anthony Comey take over.
[03:24:16.438 --> 03:24:18.681]  He's nice to let us board his show like this.
[03:24:19.161 --> 03:24:19.522]  Please.
[03:24:20.142 --> 03:24:21.203]  Let's go to Chris in Indiana.
[03:24:21.224 --> 03:24:22.104]  Chris, you're a real trooper.
[03:24:22.425 --> 03:24:25.228]  Chris in Indiana, you're on the air with Anthony Comey of compoundmedia.com.
[03:24:26.529 --> 03:24:27.150]  Hello, gentlemen.
[03:24:27.991 --> 03:24:28.211]  Go ahead.
[03:24:28.632 --> 03:24:33.978]  Hey, first of all, I'd like to give a shout out to everyone in the YouTube live stream chat on your channel.
[03:24:35.630 --> 03:24:36.290]  So, what's up everyone?
[03:24:36.511 --> 03:24:40.092]  Man, that was the biggest dog and pony show ever, man.
[03:24:40.692 --> 03:24:42.692]  Giant Tommy, James Comey.
[03:24:43.252 --> 03:24:48.094]  I mean, he's committing open perjury up there, and all those people questioning him know this.
[03:24:48.294 --> 03:24:51.095]  Why did they bring it up and pull him through the ringer for it?
[03:24:51.135 --> 03:24:53.876]  And what's up with that, in hiding with his wife and stuff?
[03:24:53.896 --> 03:24:54.556]  What's up with that?
[03:24:55.476 --> 03:25:04.219]  I'd like to say about Humpty Dumpty, all the king's horses, all the king's men couldn't put him back together again, despite all of them up there, except a few, kissing his butt, trying to prop him up.
[03:25:04.599 --> 03:25:06.920]  He was just train-wrecking, train-wrecking.
[03:25:07.120 --> 03:25:08.941]  But I guess that's because we're informed and intellectual.
[03:25:09.341 --> 03:25:15.123]  We just think of ourselves as regular guys with families, but we're actually into politics, so we know what a train wreck it was.
[03:25:15.583 --> 03:25:23.166]  Maybe to idiots that never watched a baseball game, maybe they think you're supposed to hit the ball and it gets caught by somebody, and then you don't make it around the bases.
[03:25:23.206 --> 03:25:24.487]  I mean, maybe they think that, Anthony.
[03:25:26.168 --> 03:25:29.291]  You know, why isn't the media all over?
[03:25:31.233 --> 03:25:39.080]  Who was the head, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation leaked information to the media to get something done?
[03:25:39.120 --> 03:25:40.562]  I've never heard of that!
[03:25:40.662 --> 03:25:47.108]  And it's not the biggest thing right now on every single newscast.
[03:25:47.469 --> 03:25:48.369]  The biggest thing?
[03:25:49.991 --> 03:25:53.192]  This is such a breach of the public trust.
[03:25:54.492 --> 03:25:57.553]  I don't even know how this isn't immediately criminal.
[03:25:57.793 --> 03:26:00.194]  How he wasn't taken out of there in cuffs.
[03:26:00.594 --> 03:26:03.535]  I think we should start a hashtag, jail Comey.
[03:26:04.275 --> 03:26:06.236]  Instead of Hillary for prison?
[03:26:06.336 --> 03:26:07.936]  He's the deep throat of the deep state.
[03:26:07.996 --> 03:26:09.397]  Because remember, deep throat, they said.
[03:26:09.557 --> 03:26:11.938]  Let's start it on real Alex Jones.
[03:26:11.958 --> 03:26:12.698]  We can all retweet it.
[03:26:12.938 --> 03:26:14.358]  How about jail Comey?
[03:26:14.778 --> 03:26:16.719]  And we link it to an article pointing out how this is criminal.
[03:26:17.019 --> 03:26:19.120]  USA Today right here, the president's going that direction.
[03:26:20.040 --> 03:26:21.581]  One more caller and I'm going to let Kumia take over.
[03:26:21.621 --> 03:26:23.101]  He's done a great job here letting us board.
[03:26:23.121 --> 03:26:25.182]  I need to get him back on this as a guest if he can do it.
[03:26:25.462 --> 03:26:26.643]  Rod in North Carolina.
[03:26:26.663 --> 03:26:27.563]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:26:29.524 --> 03:26:32.846]  Oh Alex, Anthony and David, God bless you.
[03:26:32.986 --> 03:26:34.867]  I'm happy to be on you guys' team.
[03:26:34.887 --> 03:26:35.827]  Thank you.
[03:26:37.328 --> 03:26:42.070]  I want to talk about this war that we're in and how, you know, we're surrounded.
[03:26:42.110 --> 03:26:42.930]  Trump is surrounded.
[03:26:42.950 --> 03:26:43.711]  We're surrounded.
[03:26:43.751 --> 03:26:48.113]  We're surrounded by the globalists, the deep state, the Democrats.
[03:26:49.767 --> 03:26:57.913]  You know, news media and worst of all, the establishment Republicans.
[03:26:59.974 --> 03:27:07.979]  We need to get united as Trump voters and strike a blow for the president.
[03:27:08.059 --> 03:27:16.085]  I think if you look at all those entities surrounding us, the one that we could really
[03:27:16.823 --> 03:27:17.163]  I don't know.
[03:27:41.417 --> 03:27:43.420]  They've screwed us, you know, once they get in office.
[03:27:50.393 --> 03:27:54.716]  I said go protest the media is the enemy, the Kathy Griffin $200,000 contest, but I said it's expanding.
[03:27:54.836 --> 03:27:56.977]  And we're about to start playing some of those clips with some of the winners here.
[03:27:56.997 --> 03:27:57.737]  There's already been a few.
[03:27:58.178 --> 03:27:59.078]  But I agree.
[03:27:59.639 --> 03:28:02.240]  Soros is targeting Republicans to make them turn against Trump.
[03:28:02.600 --> 03:28:07.303]  We need to be targeting establishment Republicans to make them back Trump and the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:28:07.323 --> 03:28:14.948]  So I'm saying $1,000 that gets on national TV of an establishment Republican being exposed as an anti-Trump, anti-American globalist.
[03:28:15.749 --> 03:28:18.853]  $2,500 if you get it hardcore with Infowars.com all over the news.
[03:28:18.893 --> 03:28:20.175]  That's part of the contest as well.
[03:28:20.395 --> 03:28:21.436]  This caller is a genius.
[03:28:21.456 --> 03:28:21.877]  David Knight?
[03:28:22.318 --> 03:28:23.719]  You know Alex, I think we're at a tipping point.
[03:28:23.739 --> 03:28:27.424]  We had NSA whistleblowers like William Binney and Thomas Drake.
[03:28:27.725 --> 03:28:31.330]  Now we have the FISA court acting as a whistleblower saying, look,
[03:28:31.830 --> 03:28:33.932]  I'd like to say that, you know, if we did this, if we had a pledge,
[03:28:55.658 --> 03:28:57.960]  Every Trump voter could get on board and sign it.
[03:28:57.980 --> 03:29:07.107]  We could shoot it to these people via email, call them on the phone, and not just the establishment Republicans, but say to the Republicans as a whole.
[03:29:07.808 --> 03:29:10.610]  Sure, call it the Pledge to Make America Great Again.
[03:29:10.650 --> 03:29:11.411]  We all take it.
[03:29:11.671 --> 03:29:12.432]  Trump takes it.
[03:29:12.752 --> 03:29:13.553]  They better take it.
[03:29:13.593 --> 03:29:14.493]  That's a great idea.
[03:29:14.814 --> 03:29:17.296]  Anthony Cumia, what's coming up next that you're taking over?
[03:29:18.116 --> 03:29:33.608]  Well, obviously this whole story with Comey and the hearings, Trump, the fake media, there's just a bounty of material from that and a couple of other things on the hypocrisy of the left and the intolerant left.
[03:29:34.088 --> 03:29:35.950]  We've got all the clips, whatever you want, they're there.
[03:29:36.130 --> 03:29:40.874]  Anthony Cumeo with compoundmedia.com coming up from the great state of America.
[03:29:42.697 --> 03:29:45.698]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:46.619 --> 03:29:49.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:54.062 --> 03:29:59.584]  President Trump has a new nominee for the FBI director, someone who was involved with the Bush administration.
[03:29:59.885 --> 03:30:04.547]  This comes after President Trump fires former FBI director James Comey last month.
[03:30:04.727 --> 03:30:06.728]  Trump's nominee is Christopher Wray.
[03:30:06.908 --> 03:30:11.690]  In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump calls Wray a man of impeccable credentials.
[03:30:12.310 --> 03:30:17.952]  Including serving as the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division under George W. Bush.
[03:30:18.372 --> 03:30:27.175]  Wray was integral to the DOJ's response to the attacks on September 11th, playing a role in the oversight and legal operational actions in the war on terrorism.
[03:30:27.335 --> 03:30:31.017]  And we all saw how good that turned out, possibly leading to the creation of ISIS.
[03:30:32.077 --> 03:30:37.083]  Ray was not part of the original shortlist as potential FBI directors being considered by the White House.
[03:30:37.383 --> 03:30:44.332]  But according to a source, Christopher Ray was interviewed by Mr. Trump and his name began to emerge as a strong possibility last week.
[03:30:44.552 --> 03:30:47.455]  Ray is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School.
[03:30:47.736 --> 03:30:51.961]  I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:30:53.732 --> 03:30:55.674]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[03:30:55.714 --> 03:30:56.775]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:30:57.035 --> 03:30:57.976]  Why is this so good?
[03:30:58.256 --> 03:31:03.501]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:31:03.581 --> 03:31:17.133]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:31:17.193 --> 03:31:18.574]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:31:19.335 --> 03:31:20.917]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:31:20.997 --> 03:31:23.479]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:31:23.579 --> 03:31:24.841]  These are all parasites.
[03:31:24.881 --> 03:31:25.982]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:31:26.002 --> 03:31:27.023]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:31:27.363 --> 03:31:31.668]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:31:31.888 --> 03:31:35.051]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:31:35.111 --> 03:31:38.172]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:31:38.192 --> 03:31:39.233]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:31:39.293 --> 03:31:41.174]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:41.234 --> 03:31:42.254]  And folks, you can't lose.

[03:31:48.257 --> 03:31:50.158]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:31:50.518 --> 03:31:52.499]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:31:53.863 --> 03:32:01.610]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:32:01.830 --> 03:32:08.256]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:32:08.496 --> 03:32:16.783]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[03:32:17.043 --> 03:32:25.813]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:32:26.073 --> 03:32:31.820]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:32:32.160 --> 03:32:32.621]  It works.
[03:32:32.901 --> 03:32:41.208]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[03:32:41.368 --> 03:32:50.775]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.

[03:33:01.571 --> 03:33:02.092]  News.
[03:33:02.633 --> 03:33:03.454]  Analysis.
[03:33:03.955 --> 03:33:04.656]  Reports.
[03:33:05.418 --> 03:33:07.601]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:08.703 --> 03:33:12.008]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia!
[03:33:16.118 --> 03:33:25.102]  Get the new Z-Shield toxic metal and chemical defense support formula for 25% off retail introductory pricing at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:33:25.483 --> 03:33:35.387]  Introducing Z-Shield, a proprietary toxic metal and chemical defense support formula now available at InfoWarsLife.com in a very limited first run.
[03:33:35.727 --> 03:33:42.811]  Countless studies show that our food, water, air loaded with toxic metals and chemicals that are known to be wreaking havoc.
[03:33:43.291 --> 03:33:43.872]  On our bodies.
[03:33:44.232 --> 03:33:49.936]  Even the EPA has admitted that more than 800 million pounds of pesticides is dumped in the U.S.
[03:33:49.996 --> 03:33:50.396]  every year.
[03:33:50.696 --> 03:33:53.719]  And 80% of these pesticides are used on our crops.
[03:33:54.419 --> 03:33:56.100]  And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:33:56.501 --> 03:34:00.924]  No matter what you do, it's virtually impossible to avoid all the toxic metals and chemicals.
[03:34:01.264 --> 03:34:10.451]  Our team of doctors, PhD herbalists, and chemists have spent years testing and developing the proprietary technology used to create Z-Shield.
[03:34:10.891 --> 03:34:16.017]  This is without a doubt one of the most game-changing formulas ever released at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:34:16.357 --> 03:34:24.387]  Z-Shield contains the organic ingredients known to help support the body in a fight against toxic metals and chemicals like cilantro.
[03:34:25.468 --> 03:34:26.429]  Uh, psyllogy!
[03:34:27.461 --> 03:34:27.982]  That's what I hear.
[03:34:28.542 --> 03:34:32.586]  Milk Thistle and Super Concentrated Zeolites.
[03:34:33.708 --> 03:34:35.029]  We sell out the first time.
[03:34:35.109 --> 03:34:35.990]  Limited run.

[03:34:47.216 --> 03:34:50.077]  Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you.
[03:34:51.138 --> 03:34:51.658]  Welcome back.
[03:34:51.718 --> 03:34:53.179]  Infowars.com.
[03:34:53.199 --> 03:34:54.339]  I'm Anthony Comia.
[03:34:55.320 --> 03:34:57.981]  Man, this has been some day.
[03:34:58.401 --> 03:35:04.204]  Because it starts by watching the Comey hearings.
[03:35:05.024 --> 03:35:17.828]  And, man, you sure know what side, what team the congressperson, I want to be politically correct, the congressperson is on when they throw the questions out.
[03:35:18.228 --> 03:35:26.911]  I don't need the D or the R next to their name, because the Democrats, while they're questioning Comey, just vicious.
[03:35:27.992 --> 03:35:36.542]  Vile, a lot of lying coming out, a lot of leading questions trying to put their point of view out there.
[03:35:37.884 --> 03:35:39.386]  This should be about fact-gathering.
[03:35:39.666 --> 03:35:45.894]  And boy, I know, I've seen Republicans do the same thing when the shoe's on the other foot, as they say.
[03:35:46.835 --> 03:35:52.986]  When Hillary Clinton was up there, you know, the Republicans were a lot more vicious with her.
[03:35:53.467 --> 03:35:54.248]  Well, they should be.
[03:35:55.290 --> 03:35:58.896]  But I want to know facts.
[03:35:59.901 --> 03:36:06.987]  I don't want to know a party line of why a person did something that they did.
[03:36:07.227 --> 03:36:10.710]  They ask Comey a question and they want an answer.
[03:36:10.750 --> 03:36:12.311]  They want a certain answer from him.
[03:36:12.511 --> 03:36:13.452]  They don't want the truth.
[03:36:14.092 --> 03:36:19.016]  They want him to say something that bodes well for their team.
[03:36:19.737 --> 03:36:23.220]  And that is against what this whole thing is supposed to be.
[03:36:23.980 --> 03:36:24.400]  Facts.
[03:36:25.021 --> 03:36:25.961]  Finding facts.
[03:36:26.481 --> 03:36:28.102]  Getting them out to the American people.
[03:36:28.382 --> 03:36:34.866]  So we could decide who is best to run the government.
[03:36:35.266 --> 03:36:36.666]  And who should be thrown the hell out.
[03:36:36.947 --> 03:36:38.067]  And who should go to jail.
[03:36:38.567 --> 03:36:39.468]  That's what I want to know.
[03:36:39.848 --> 03:36:40.788]  I want the facts.
[03:36:41.129 --> 03:36:45.371]  So when they sit there and talk about feelings,
[03:36:46.647 --> 03:37:00.102]  And my opinion of an idea that some... I don't care if Donald Trump said he hopes they could wrap up with the Flynn investigation.
[03:37:01.568 --> 03:37:05.371]  I hope we can, you know, get through this, get past this, whatever.
[03:37:05.892 --> 03:37:08.494]  That is him saying, I hope we can.
[03:37:08.794 --> 03:37:12.397]  Does anyone doubt that he hoped they could get through that?
[03:37:12.417 --> 03:37:13.518]  Of course he did.
[03:37:13.938 --> 03:37:24.066]  He had said numerous times that the investigation on the whole was interfering with his ability to do the job he was elected to do.
[03:37:24.506 --> 03:37:26.128]  So of course he wanted it over with.
[03:37:26.608 --> 03:37:27.268]  And he hoped
[03:37:28.169 --> 03:37:33.110]  To the guy running the investigation, that it could be remedied as quickly as possible.
[03:37:34.090 --> 03:37:41.232]  Well, let's bring on the mainstream media to say, what does that mean?
[03:37:42.532 --> 03:37:45.993]  Well, it means he hopes it could be wrapped up.
[03:37:46.593 --> 03:37:47.453]  That's what it means.
[03:37:48.313 --> 03:37:50.534]  But the interpretations you will hear
[03:37:51.303 --> 03:38:01.873]  From mainstream media and the brainwashed minion or the paid Soros minion on social media is just one of the most frustrating things.
[03:38:02.233 --> 03:38:16.506]  I really got to just sit back and throw my phone away from me at some point because I can't stop trying to beat it into these people's heads that they are being manipulated by mainstream media.
[03:38:17.642 --> 03:38:25.130]  They hear what they want to hear on the news, and the news feeds it to them as they want to hear it, and they just think it's fact.
[03:38:25.771 --> 03:38:31.917]  The truth of the matter is, Comey got up there and said that Trump wasn't being investigated.
[03:38:32.658 --> 03:38:39.305]  At no time during his tenure as director of the FBI was Donald Trump being investigated.
[03:38:41.236 --> 03:38:43.377]  That right there was giant!
[03:38:44.038 --> 03:38:52.302]  A huge statement to make, because we had heard from mainstream media that, oh, look out, a president that's under investigation.
[03:38:52.342 --> 03:38:53.883]  This is unbelievable.
[03:38:54.203 --> 03:38:55.224]  Well, it wasn't happening.
[03:38:55.744 --> 03:38:57.765]  Just one of the many lies.
[03:38:59.286 --> 03:39:03.188]  Oh, was he involved colluding with the Russians?
[03:39:04.371 --> 03:39:08.134]  To affect the election?
[03:39:08.554 --> 03:39:09.155]  Who was elected?
[03:39:09.815 --> 03:39:10.115]  No!
[03:39:11.076 --> 03:39:11.396]  No!
[03:39:13.577 --> 03:39:24.865]  Was there any evidence that anybody in Trump's circle during the campaign was involved in any way with the Russians trying to affect the election?
[03:39:25.446 --> 03:39:25.686]  No!
[03:39:27.895 --> 03:39:29.036]  What does that mean to a liberal?
[03:39:29.717 --> 03:39:30.778]  Impeachment!
[03:39:31.719 --> 03:39:32.760]  It's impeachment!
[03:39:32.840 --> 03:39:33.621]  It's happening!
[03:39:33.641 --> 03:39:47.954]  I don't understand how you can look at something so clear-cut, so simple, and get the complete opposite idea of what was just said.
[03:39:49.457 --> 03:39:54.382]  It's... I really see this as being a modern, recent thing that is happening.
[03:39:54.722 --> 03:39:58.586]  And I put the blame squarely on mainstream media.
[03:39:59.867 --> 03:40:08.113]  Years ago, they were able to manipulate people's opinion, and they saw that that was good for them.
[03:40:09.634 --> 03:40:18.820]  Whoever the powers that be were in place at the time would give information to the media, they would put it out there, it would manipulate hearts and minds.
[03:40:20.241 --> 03:40:24.364]  Well, recently, they're not even trying to hide it anymore.
[03:40:24.644 --> 03:40:25.805]  They are blatantly
[03:40:26.875 --> 03:40:31.217]  Lying to drive people's opinions in a certain direction.
[03:40:31.717 --> 03:40:39.560]  And people are being misled and lied to and given information that they then spread on social media as fact.
[03:40:40.421 --> 03:40:43.262]  We saw this with Hands Up Don't Shoot.
[03:40:43.842 --> 03:40:50.785]  We see this with Trump all during the campaign and now during his presidency.
[03:40:51.505 --> 03:40:53.887]  Just blatant lies, and then they're exposed!
[03:40:54.648 --> 03:40:59.472]  Lies were exposed this afternoon during the Comey hearings.
[03:41:00.754 --> 03:41:01.314]  Exposed.
[03:41:01.954 --> 03:41:04.215]  And they weren't lies that Donald Trump was telling.
[03:41:04.635 --> 03:41:08.896]  They were lies that the media was telling the people of this country.
[03:41:09.676 --> 03:41:10.676]  And they were called out.
[03:41:11.176 --> 03:41:11.796]  Who they were.
[03:41:11.816 --> 03:41:12.776]  The Washington Post.
[03:41:12.796 --> 03:41:13.697]  The Huffington Post.
[03:41:15.257 --> 03:41:16.297]  Mainstream news.
[03:41:16.377 --> 03:41:16.917]  CNN.
[03:41:17.317 --> 03:41:18.858]  They are being called out.
[03:41:19.058 --> 03:41:25.059]  You can see screencaps of their ticker on the bottom saying one thing.
[03:41:26.039 --> 03:41:29.764]  And it being disproved today, during the hearings.
[03:41:30.445 --> 03:41:33.549]  Yet, people still won't believe it.
[03:41:34.090 --> 03:41:35.492]  I don't know what it's going to take.
[03:41:36.333 --> 03:41:40.799]  Stop watching these mainstream media broadcasts.
[03:41:42.044 --> 03:41:43.665]  It's detrimental!
[03:41:44.806 --> 03:42:01.194]  If you're not watching it as sole research into how the media is corrupting the population of this country and the world, if you're watching it to actually get news, that's a huge problem and you should probably stop.
[03:42:01.894 --> 03:42:06.877]  I feel like I have to do an intervention here and tell you, please, please,
[03:42:07.830 --> 03:42:08.410]  Turn away.
[03:42:09.151 --> 03:42:19.596]  If you're watching for research on how poorly they are presenting news to people, then there's plenty to chew on, as far as that goes.
[03:42:20.916 --> 03:42:28.220]  We also learned that Russia was indeed using computers, cyber attacks,
[03:42:29.366 --> 03:42:32.568]  To somehow affect the election.
[03:42:33.188 --> 03:42:35.689]  I don't know what side they were gunning for.
[03:42:35.869 --> 03:42:38.991]  As Alex has said, probably playing both sides of the fence.
[03:42:39.491 --> 03:42:40.512]  See who gets in there.
[03:42:41.152 --> 03:42:52.358]  But apparently the Democrats and the DNC made it so easy for them to get information and emails.
[03:42:53.450 --> 03:43:02.814]  And memos and everything else from their team, that's what was put out over WikiLeaks.
[03:43:02.994 --> 03:43:10.258]  Why blame the people that are ripping off your information out of your computer when you left the doors open?
[03:43:10.918 --> 03:43:16.801]  If I leave my doors open in my house, not even unlocked, wide open, my windows are open,
[03:43:17.586 --> 03:43:19.007]  And I don't have a car in the driveway.
[03:43:19.048 --> 03:43:21.870]  Let me pile up some mail and newspapers by my mailbox.
[03:43:22.511 --> 03:43:28.997]  And then I play the victim when someone comes in and steals my stuff?
[03:43:29.858 --> 03:43:34.663]  They almost put a sign out saying, here, take our stuff and release it to the people.
[03:43:35.814 --> 03:43:48.203]  Also, they never once denied any one of those emails that were released as part of this Russian intrusion on the election.
[03:43:48.624 --> 03:43:51.506]  Never once did they deny one thing.
[03:43:51.746 --> 03:43:54.468]  So again, who's the bad guy here?
[03:43:55.569 --> 03:43:57.650]  We're not fans of the Russians here.
[03:43:57.931 --> 03:44:00.692]  They've made an interesting adversary over the decades.
[03:44:01.073 --> 03:44:03.654]  But we don't sit there and go, yeah, look at them go.
[03:44:04.155 --> 03:44:05.275]  Hack our computers.
[03:44:05.836 --> 03:44:07.157]  Get into our intelligence.
[03:44:08.397 --> 03:44:09.698]  Undermine our military.
[03:44:09.718 --> 03:44:09.758]  No.
[03:44:11.279 --> 03:44:16.403]  We have to look at who they're taking stuff from and say, hey, come here, come here.
[03:44:17.023 --> 03:44:18.064]  What are you doing?
[03:44:18.804 --> 03:44:21.086]  Lock your junk up, you moron.
[03:44:22.062 --> 03:44:27.086]  But again, and man, the left is great at doing this.
[03:44:27.767 --> 03:44:28.548]  The victim.
[03:44:30.229 --> 03:44:31.550]  He broke me!
[03:44:31.910 --> 03:44:33.512]  They love playing the victim.
[03:44:33.612 --> 03:44:34.573]  Even Comey today.
[03:44:35.233 --> 03:44:36.214]  Even Comey today.
[03:44:37.095 --> 03:44:38.896]  Well, I'm a bit of a coward.
[03:44:40.308 --> 03:44:41.930]  Oh lordy, I hope there's tapes.
[03:44:43.011 --> 03:44:43.811]  Oh my gosh.
[03:44:44.612 --> 03:44:47.415]  Oh, I certainly, uh, I wish I was stronger.
[03:44:48.155 --> 03:44:49.196]  I wish I was stronger.
[03:44:49.777 --> 03:44:57.303]  That's this victimization that the left will pull, and it really resonates with their followers.
[03:44:57.704 --> 03:45:03.849]  It disgusts real men, by the way, to see a man just going like, oh really?
[03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:05.050]  Buck up!
[03:45:05.971 --> 03:45:09.272]  Get in his face and say, hey, I don't like what you were doing.
[03:45:09.392 --> 03:45:10.312]  I don't like what you're saying.
[03:45:10.612 --> 03:45:14.573]  I think there's some problems with us having a conversation like this.
[03:45:14.893 --> 03:45:15.654]  Do something.
[03:45:16.234 --> 03:45:22.255]  Then you sit in front of Congress and, oh my gosh, oh well, wish I was a little stronger.
[03:45:23.176 --> 03:45:32.058]  It's embarrassing, but it plays well to the left because they are a collection of perpetual victims.
[03:45:33.334 --> 03:45:38.317]  Now you look at what the Russians were doing, again, just wide open doors, they came in and took stuff.
[03:45:39.418 --> 03:45:40.258]  You can't blame them.
[03:45:40.759 --> 03:45:56.889]  But to say they had an effect on the election because that was released, and not put an ounce of blame on who could possibly be the worst candidate ever to run for President of the United States, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[03:45:58.004 --> 03:46:05.188]  And her merry men like Podesta and the rest of the clowns that ran one of the worst campaigns ever.
[03:46:06.389 --> 03:46:07.449]  That's why she lost.
[03:46:07.709 --> 03:46:13.092]  But the excuses, again, perpetual victimization coming out of the left.
[03:46:14.013 --> 03:46:18.375]  You never hear how she had no agenda.
[03:46:19.375 --> 03:46:28.168]  How she was literally, and I hate when that word's used because it's used so improperly and much too often these days, but with Hillary a few things can be literally.
[03:46:28.669 --> 03:46:30.031]  Literally falling down!
[03:46:31.118 --> 03:46:34.321]  On the job, literally falling down.
[03:46:35.622 --> 03:46:43.809]  These were things we didn't like to see in a potential president of the United States, and we voted accordingly as a nation.
[03:46:44.029 --> 03:46:47.292]  We were also very tired of business as usual.
[03:46:48.433 --> 03:46:51.896]  We felt for decades that we're getting screwed by Washington.
[03:46:51.996 --> 03:46:55.819]  They are not representative of the people, which is what they're supposed to be.
[03:46:56.340 --> 03:46:57.701]  Our representatives.
[03:46:58.001 --> 03:47:01.642]  I can't go over to Washington and go, hey, hey Washington, I need this.
[03:47:02.102 --> 03:47:03.642]  So people represent you.
[03:47:04.522 --> 03:47:05.702]  Are you seeing that?
[03:47:06.343 --> 03:47:12.764]  Are you seeing somebody talking for you in Washington and going, yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to say.
[03:47:12.784 --> 03:47:14.624]  That's exactly how I want this.
[03:47:14.964 --> 03:47:16.244]  No, I want more regulations.
[03:47:16.664 --> 03:47:20.885]  I want to have to pay an inspector so I could cut a tree down in my own yard.
[03:47:21.345 --> 03:47:23.566]  Is that really what we want our government doing?
[03:47:24.246 --> 03:47:24.426]  Well,
[03:47:25.296 --> 03:47:27.476]  Our representatives are supposed to represent us.
[03:47:27.857 --> 03:47:28.657]  They don't do that.
[03:47:29.137 --> 03:47:33.738]  And Donald Trump is the exact thing we needed.
[03:47:34.198 --> 03:47:53.082]  I get crucified all the time on Twitter and other social media because when I talk about Donald Trump and having voted for him, and I talk about these hearings and saying that there is no evidence of collusion or obstructing justice, people go, why do you have to kiss Donald Trump's ass so much?
[03:47:53.962 --> 03:47:55.643]  I'm like, I'm not kissing his ass.
[03:47:56.564 --> 03:47:59.807]  I don't even really like or dislike Donald Trump.
[03:48:00.187 --> 03:48:06.372]  I voted for him because I was tired of being screwed by every single elected official.
[03:48:06.952 --> 03:48:21.003]  And I thought a Donald Trump presidency is the best way to show them that we are sick and tired of us being their cash cows, being led to slaughter,
[03:48:22.657 --> 03:48:24.158]  And we wanted a change.
[03:48:24.538 --> 03:48:25.238]  A big change.
[03:48:25.658 --> 03:48:27.979]  Not these little changes that have gone on over the years.
[03:48:28.259 --> 03:48:30.359]  The same problem.
[03:48:30.800 --> 03:48:32.680]  Oh, he's a Republican, he's a Democrat, he's this.
[03:48:32.900 --> 03:48:36.381]  Donald Trump showed them just how mad everybody was.
[03:48:37.122 --> 03:48:43.664]  Sure, I like some of his policies and ideas, but I mostly liked that he wasn't any of them.
[03:48:43.684 --> 03:48:47.225]  And it really upset
[03:48:48.699 --> 03:48:51.040]  The whole Washington establishment.
[03:48:52.001 --> 03:48:57.603]  The left, who loves, loves government buried deep inside them.
[03:48:58.163 --> 03:48:58.584]  Loves it!
[03:48:59.324 --> 03:49:00.804]  Can't stand this is happening.
[03:49:01.285 --> 03:49:04.006]  Because he just wants to stop big government.
[03:49:04.146 --> 03:49:13.290]  He wants to stop everybody telling you that you can't do this and that and pursue happiness in this great country.
[03:49:13.690 --> 03:49:17.672]  That I have to pay a fee to cut a tree down in my yard.
[03:49:18.332 --> 03:49:26.575]  And I never told a politician to go to Washington and tell whoever's in charge that I want to pay when I want to cut a tree down in my yard.
[03:49:27.455 --> 03:49:29.796]  That's the type of thing we needed changed.
[03:49:30.316 --> 03:49:37.698]  Was the government just so deep in us that we needed to show them something different.
[03:49:38.712 --> 03:49:40.133]  That's why Donald Trump won.
[03:49:40.913 --> 03:49:41.834]  Not the Russians.
[03:49:42.094 --> 03:49:49.898]  It was Hillary being a lousy candidate and Washington screwing us so badly over so many years that we wanted Donald Trump.
[03:49:50.058 --> 03:49:55.481]  But the establishment can't take it and they will continue to try to come up with anything they can.
[03:49:55.761 --> 03:50:05.126]  So when you look at something like today with the Comey hearings and start seeing, hey, wow, he's really kind of exonerating Donald Trump here.
[03:50:06.929 --> 03:50:10.112]  By saying these things, and they turn it around still!
[03:50:10.772 --> 03:50:24.884]  They try to take any crumb of out-of-context conversation, or an aside, or a I think, I hope, and turn it into a fact that he has committed some crime.
[03:50:25.724 --> 03:50:33.906]  I called it a mental illness in the past when I have chit chats with these people on various social media.
[03:50:34.246 --> 03:50:36.267]  I'm like, this is a mental illness.
[03:50:36.527 --> 03:50:40.948]  It's childlike, it's immature, it's based solely on emotion.
[03:50:41.388 --> 03:50:42.069]  I want facts.
[03:50:42.929 --> 03:50:46.510]  I want facts and I want real court-admitted evidence.
[03:50:47.270 --> 03:50:49.796]  Of collusion or obstruction.
[03:50:50.076 --> 03:50:51.098]  And we will never get that.
[03:50:51.519 --> 03:50:52.401]  Because it didn't happen.
[03:50:52.722 --> 03:50:53.283]  InfoWars.
[03:50:54.225 --> 03:50:56.389]  Imagine the world without InfoWars.
[03:50:59.827 --> 03:51:01.808]  The globalists have already consolidated their power.
[03:51:02.308 --> 03:51:06.009]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[03:51:06.730 --> 03:51:20.035]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[03:51:20.455 --> 03:51:23.416]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit,
[03:51:24.116 --> 03:51:25.658]  Telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[03:51:26.380 --> 03:51:30.205]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate,
[03:51:31.500 --> 03:51:37.584]  News and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[03:51:37.885 --> 03:51:40.687]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[03:51:41.607 --> 03:51:56.558]  And I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[03:51:56.578 --> 03:51:59.140]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[03:52:00.467 --> 03:52:12.795]  And it is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWareStore.com.
[03:52:13.636 --> 03:52:16.158]  On top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip,
[03:52:16.678 --> 03:52:22.260]  You get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[03:52:22.820 --> 03:52:25.460]  Emerix Essentials is all about personal care.
[03:52:25.900 --> 03:52:26.521]  Hygiene.
[03:52:26.801 --> 03:52:28.001]  Not getting skin cancer.
[03:52:28.501 --> 03:52:32.162]  Not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[03:52:32.642 --> 03:52:33.643]  It's all there.
[03:52:33.803 --> 03:52:34.583]  The body wash.
[03:52:34.683 --> 03:52:35.443]  The shampoo.
[03:52:35.983 --> 03:52:36.623]  The deodorant.
[03:52:37.083 --> 03:52:37.844]  The mouthwash.
[03:52:38.304 --> 03:52:38.684]  All of it!
[03:52:39.204 --> 03:52:40.405]  This is truly game-changing.
[03:52:40.906 --> 03:52:41.687]  BOA spray.
[03:52:42.007 --> 03:52:44.029]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[03:52:44.750 --> 03:52:48.313]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[03:52:48.694 --> 03:52:50.956]  And it is comparable in price.
[03:52:51.256 --> 03:52:52.697]  And again, it's concentrated.
[03:52:53.038 --> 03:52:54.459]  The deodorant is amazing.
[03:52:54.900 --> 03:52:55.600]  High quality.
[03:52:56.281 --> 03:52:57.803]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[03:52:58.103 --> 03:52:58.844]  Totally natural.
[03:52:59.124 --> 03:52:59.584]  Works great.
[03:53:00.525 --> 03:53:04.272]  SPF 30, face and body lotion, sunscreen, unscented.
[03:53:04.852 --> 03:53:09.620]  This is exciting because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[03:53:10.061 --> 03:53:12.064]  As everyone knows, I'm obsessed with Win-Wins.
[03:53:12.084 --> 03:53:13.246]  20% off what it is retail,
[03:53:15.316 --> 03:53:16.377]  Because we cut out the middleman.
[03:53:17.158 --> 03:53:21.082]  And then, additionally, you sign up for auto-ship out of the gates.
[03:53:21.102 --> 03:53:21.603]  25% off that.
[03:53:22.083 --> 03:53:24.125]  Because I want you to try these products.
[03:53:24.265 --> 03:53:25.487]  I want you to love these products.
[03:53:25.847 --> 03:53:36.478]  I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win, a non-zero-sum game, where you get high quality, you get value, and you repeat order something you need every month.
[03:53:37.339 --> 03:53:44.969]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[03:53:45.250 --> 03:53:49.876]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[03:54:02.144 --> 03:54:08.708]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:09.208 --> 03:54:12.571]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:54:14.092 --> 03:54:20.316]  Introducing the new Emrix Essentials line of organic household products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:20.536 --> 03:54:23.778]  For over two decades, listeners have been asking me and Alex,
[03:54:24.258 --> 03:54:31.745]  Why we don't carry our own line of organic household products like bug spray, sunscreen, and body wash at InfoWarsStore.com?
[03:54:31.925 --> 03:54:39.051]  The answer, quite frankly, because even after trying out hundreds of different brands and speaking to dozens of manufacturers, there was always a deal breaker.
[03:54:39.071 --> 03:54:44.076]  Either the products contained hidden toxic ingredients, or they were way too overpriced.
[03:54:44.696 --> 03:54:45.136]  Don't want that.
[03:54:45.576 --> 03:54:56.581]  After 23 years, I found out about a company run by fellow patriots that was dedicated to producing high-quality organic products that were even better and cost far less than other leading brands.
[03:54:56.801 --> 03:55:03.844]  They agreed to launch a new private label line with us called Emerix Essentials and give us the best exclusive pricing.
[03:55:04.144 --> 03:55:07.946]  That's about 20% less than many of the brands you see in major grocery stores.
[03:55:08.186 --> 03:55:20.863]  We're proud to introduce an entire new line of organic-based household products at Infowarsstore.com, including non-nano SPF 30 zinc oxide sunscreen, DEET-free herbal bug spray.
[03:55:20.883 --> 03:55:21.564]  You don't want that DEET.
[03:55:22.407 --> 03:55:31.115]  And concentrated peppermint mouthwash, pure unscented body wash, pure tea tree shampoo, long-lasting natural deodorant, and a lot more at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:31.335 --> 03:55:35.299]  Start saving money, stop exposing yourself and your family to toxic ingredients.
[03:55:35.599 --> 03:55:41.744]  Visit InfoWarsStore.com and learn about the new line of Emerix Essentials organic products.
[03:55:42.025 --> 03:55:44.267]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:55:45.743 --> 03:55:49.384]  Uh, we got a couple of minutes left here, and I gotta hit on this story.
[03:55:49.644 --> 03:55:51.765]  This is beyond all reason.
[03:55:52.345 --> 03:55:56.147]  Um, you know, kids are usually, uh, crucified these days.
[03:55:56.627 --> 03:56:01.369]  For, uh, you get an eight-year-old, nine, ten-year-old kid, a son, uh, and his dad.
[03:56:01.709 --> 03:56:04.910]  They, uh, they're interested in going to the range and shooting a rifle.
[03:56:05.490 --> 03:56:07.231]  Uh, teaching the kid about firearms.
[03:56:07.632 --> 03:56:09.473]  And, oh my God, that's terrible!
[03:56:09.513 --> 03:56:11.835]  The kid should be taken away from his parents!
[03:56:11.895 --> 03:56:12.535]  That's crazy!
[03:56:12.976 --> 03:56:15.998]  Oh, the kid went to school today with a shirt that had the U.S.
[03:56:16.038 --> 03:56:17.019]  Marine Corps on it!
[03:56:17.379 --> 03:56:17.999]  Wow!
[03:56:18.039 --> 03:56:18.800]  He's crazy!
[03:56:18.820 --> 03:56:19.661]  He's a wild man!
[03:56:19.681 --> 03:56:20.822]  He's a potential murderer!
[03:56:21.582 --> 03:56:23.624]  Get him some psychiatric help!
[03:56:24.084 --> 03:56:25.545]  Oh my God, he got a flag!
[03:56:25.565 --> 03:56:28.167]  He has an American flag on his vehicle!
[03:56:28.527 --> 03:56:31.730]  Oh my God, your son is a maniac!
[03:56:33.479 --> 03:56:41.504]  The gay media, I don't know what the gay media is, but it's the gay media promoting an 8-year-old drag queen.
[03:56:42.385 --> 03:56:50.210]  This is an 8-year-old boy that is being gussied up as a girl and celebrated.
[03:56:50.791 --> 03:56:52.212]  This is celebrated.
[03:56:52.872 --> 03:56:57.695]  Now as far as gay rights go, I don't care what the heck you do with yourself.
[03:56:58.155 --> 03:56:58.856]  That's fine.
[03:56:59.556 --> 03:57:03.079]  But I absolutely see this as some form of child abuse.
[03:57:03.999 --> 03:57:19.026]  An eight-year-old is in no frame of mind to decide if he wants to be gussied up and paraded in front of a bunch of men that are also gussied up like a woman.
[03:57:19.446 --> 03:57:20.786]  This is insanity!
[03:57:20.806 --> 03:57:28.990]  And as I said, you will get kids will get in trouble if they just do what is considered traditional
[03:57:29.950 --> 03:57:55.296]  uh... activities with their their dad or uh... what or what have you you know i remember going out and uh... going shooting with my father and it was just a great experience now if this kid decided he wanted to go to school like that do you think any school would throw him out or would they have to embrace it and take him in and and and show that it was all ok
[03:57:56.596 --> 03:57:58.498]  The left is losing their mind.
[03:57:59.038 --> 03:58:01.620]  We are beyond the slippery slope here, people.
[03:58:02.020 --> 03:58:03.101]  We are well beyond.
[03:58:03.322 --> 03:58:08.185]  When you look at something like that, we are way beyond any slippery slope.
[03:58:08.406 --> 03:58:15.952]  We've slid down it, we've gone off the jump, and if you remember the old wide world of sports, agony, defeat, that's where we are right now.
[03:58:16.432 --> 03:58:22.357]  Head over ass, over the edge of the ski jump, in for the agony of defeat.
[03:58:23.499 --> 03:58:24.100]  I don't get it.
[03:58:24.540 --> 03:58:33.370]  Traditional values are looked at as horrible things and yet an eight-year-old boy could dress like a girl and be paraded around in front of other men.
[03:58:33.650 --> 03:58:35.212]  It's ludicrous.
[03:58:35.532 --> 03:58:37.514]  Anthony Cumia in for InfoWars.com.
[03:58:37.534 --> 03:58:39.536]  Catch me on CompoundMedia.com.
[03:58:39.837 --> 03:58:41.198]  We'll see you next time right here.
[03:58:41.318 --> 03:58:41.819]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:58:43.899 --> 03:58:49.402]  President Trump has a new nominee for the FBI Director, someone who was involved with the Bush administration.
[03:58:49.682 --> 03:58:54.324]  This comes after President Trump fires former FBI Director James Comey last month.
[03:58:54.544 --> 03:58:56.525]  Trump's nominee is Christopher Wray.
[03:58:56.705 --> 03:59:01.508]  In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump calls Wray a man of impeccable credentials.
[03:59:02.108 --> 03:59:07.772]  Including serving as the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division under George W. Bush.
[03:59:08.193 --> 03:59:16.979]  Wray was integral to the DOJ's response to the attacks on September 11th, playing a role in the oversight and legal operational actions in the war on terrorism.
[03:59:17.159 --> 03:59:21.062]  And we all saw how good that turned out, possibly leading to the creation of ISIS.
[03:59:21.903 --> 03:59:26.907]  Ray was not part of the original shortlist as potential FBI directors being considered by the White House.
[03:59:27.187 --> 03:59:34.153]  But according to a source, Christopher Ray was interviewed by Mr. Trump and his name began to emerge as a strong possibility last week.
[03:59:34.353 --> 03:59:37.256]  Ray is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School.
[03:59:37.516 --> 03:59:41.799]  I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:59:44.802 --> 03:59:48.865]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:59:49.406 --> 03:59:50.667]  It's Alex Jones.
