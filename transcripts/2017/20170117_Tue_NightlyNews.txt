[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.642]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.762 --> 00:00:25.586]  It is Tuesday, January 17th, 2017 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.646 --> 00:00:26.707]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:29.970]  Tonight.
[00:00:31.246 --> 00:00:37.488]  Fake polls are in again, as polls are beginning to emerge showing Donald Trump as the least favorable incoming president.
[00:00:37.928 --> 00:00:41.929]  Trump took to Twitter to bash the fake polls, proven to be rigged again.
[00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:59.453]  Meanwhile, as radical leftists plan to illegally disrupt the inauguration and events surrounding it, these illegal activities are being ignored by Barack Obama and the mainstream media.
[00:00:59.713 --> 00:00:59.993]  Also,
[00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:05.115]  Barack Obama is releasing Guantanamo Bay prisoners in front of the looming Trump administration.
[00:01:05.595 --> 00:01:08.616]  What's the motivation behind the latest Gitmo developments?
[00:01:09.096 --> 00:01:11.497]  And then, jobs, jobs, jobs.
[00:01:12.057 --> 00:01:17.638]  Trumpledore waves his magic job wand again as Trump continues to deliver on jobs.
[00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.260]  All that and more tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:01.718 --> 00:03:07.604]  Well, we've got an update on those radical leftists that plan to target Donald Trump's inauguration.
[00:03:08.264 --> 00:03:12.568]  Project Veritas released part two of their undercover sting video.
[00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.450]  This was covertly filming.
[00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.853]  They were covertly filming the leaders from several left-wing organizations.
[00:03:18.214 --> 00:03:22.377]  They were conducting training workshops to inform their comrades.
[00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:31.961]  On how these anti-inauguration events will proceed, and they plan on targeting the DC metro rail line to block inauguration access.
[00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:39.823]  One Disrupt J20 organizer explains that the protest is going to consist of several cluster blockades.
[00:03:40.224 --> 00:03:43.885]  They're going to try to blockade all the major ingress points in the city.
[00:03:45.034 --> 00:03:50.897]  They say that includes shutting down major bridges and highway access points, as well as shutting down metro rail.
[00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:55.399]  So to do that, we're going to try to break into several teams, kind of like the checkpoints.
[00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:57.099]  So here we are.
[00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:58.940]  They've got their little brown shirts.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.901]  They're rounding up the brown shirts.
[00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:05.243]  They're going to start these checkpoints and ask you if you are a fascist.
[00:04:05.743 --> 00:04:07.025]  That's going to vote for Trump.
[00:04:07.145 --> 00:04:19.620]  They're celebrating Trump's presidency and then these anti-fascists are going to beat you and block you from going about your day in this free country because they are protesting the free election of Donald Trump.
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.942]  What a WALL-E world we are living in.
[00:04:22.623 --> 00:04:26.626]  So one of these people, they go on to say, you know, fears in doing this.
[00:04:26.726 --> 00:04:33.471]  We don't think that these are going to be necessarily arrestable actions, but there is a possibility that you could be arrested.
[00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:36.513]  So keep that in mind if you want to participate.
[00:04:37.294 --> 00:04:42.557]  But another video clip goes on describing how agitators would go about doing this.
[00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:46.801]  And they're talking about not just one, but every single line in the city.
[00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:48.402]  So this is going to be big here.
[00:04:48.942 --> 00:05:13.456]  So they say we figure out the trains pull up one person is going to lock one end of a chain to an edge and on the other end of the chain the end of the car so on and on and then you're done it takes 15 seconds and everyone can leave and literally it can't go anywhere at that point it's anchored and you can use a really thin chain you don't need to use a heavy chain it would require like a bolt cutter to undo so you're basically going to shut down that line
[00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:18.001]  They want to hit the Metro Center, Gallery Place, L'Enfant Plaza.
[00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:21.545]  They want to close down every single line in the city.
[00:05:21.565 --> 00:05:21.605]  So...
[00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:39.073]  I mean this is insane and frankly this is domestic terrorism and actually Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe notes that the acts being discussed in the video could be construed as terroristic acts violating federal law.
[00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:42.714]  Disabling trains constitutes an act of terrorism under 18 U.S.C.
[00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:42.714]  1992.
[00:05:42.754 --> 00:05:44.455]  It states offenders shall be fined
[00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:52.721]  Um, under this title are imprisoned not more than 20 years or both.
[00:05:53.261 --> 00:06:00.209]  If the offense results in the death of any person, they could be in prison for any term of years or for life or subject to death.
[00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.991]  So think about that.
[00:06:02.051 --> 00:06:03.853]  They say they want to deploy these stink bombs.
[00:06:03.993 --> 00:06:08.659]  Oh, well those aren't, you know, there's nothing so bad about those stink bombs, but what if you cause a stampede?
[00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.201]  They're in the deplorable and someone is trampled on and killed.
[00:06:13.501 --> 00:06:15.361]  Well, now you've got that hanging on your head.
[00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:33.368]  And James O'Keefe was actually on the Alex Jones Show today, and he was calling out the mainstream media saying they're going to be complicit in something like that because they are refusing to report on this groundbreaking undercover video, ignoring the radical threats that are being made against Donald Trump.
[00:06:34.108 --> 00:06:35.930]  They're refusing to cover this news at all.
[00:06:37.411 --> 00:06:40.453]  And he's saying that this is criminal what the media is doing.
[00:06:41.274 --> 00:07:02.830]  Frankly, it's the media's job to not only alert the many travelers and tourists that are going to be in D.C., but also the authorities need to be alerted at the fact that they're basically spelling out their plans of how they're going to be releasing acid into the deplorable and causing, you know, releasing stink bombs and how they're going to be shutting down all the D.C.
[00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.751]  metro lines and
[00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:04.491]  We're good.
[00:07:26.059 --> 00:07:28.821]  That they were talking to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:33.265]  So they were just making all this stuff up, just saying, oh, it's just a prank.
[00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:38.008]  You know, he, James O'Keefe, actually points out the same point that I just made.
[00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:43.253]  This butyric acid is flammable, could burn your lungs and cause a stampede out of the National Press Club.
[00:07:43.293 --> 00:07:44.073]  That's very dangerous.
[00:07:44.173 --> 00:07:46.055]  That's more than just a prank.
[00:07:46.695 --> 00:07:54.922]  And if you see the guy in the video that's actually talking to this undercover Project Veritas reporter about how to build this sink bomb,
[00:07:55.422 --> 00:07:58.463]  He's so creepy and he gets into major detail about it.
[00:07:58.523 --> 00:08:03.765]  It's basically like you're listening to a terrorist talking about how to build a pipe bomb or a pressure cooker.
[00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:06.266]  I mean, these are the type of people that we're dealing with.
[00:08:06.546 --> 00:08:11.968]  These domestic terrorists, ironic that these anti-fascists want to be gassing people and
[00:08:13.668 --> 00:08:15.510]  Look at this this guy there on the left.
[00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:26.558]  I mean he looks just like your average guy Just picking his kids up at school and dropping them off and here he is with the creepy guy on the right-hand side Who's like, oh, I know how to build pipe bombs.
[00:08:26.678 --> 00:08:30.400]  Oh, I could do it We'll just we're gonna burn your house down if we find you.
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:38.807]  I mean these are total creeps and these are the people that are You know trying to fight fascism with fascism.
[00:08:39.047 --> 00:08:40.328]  It's very ironic there and
[00:08:40.928 --> 00:08:42.569]  Now, an update on that deplorable.
[00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:49.653]  The organizer, Mike Cernovich, said that he plans to file charges over the Antifa acid attack plans.
[00:08:49.773 --> 00:08:55.696]  He goes on to say they seem to think it's just a prank, but I would refer them to the Department of Justice's website.
[00:08:56.076 --> 00:08:57.177]  It's actually a felony.
[00:08:57.237 --> 00:09:00.179]  There's a lot of law on the books on it, so that'll be interesting to see.
[00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:02.280]  Cernovich usually doesn't make veiled threats.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:12.485]  And we've also got reports of ads in two dozen cities offering protesters up to $2,500 to agitate at the Trump inauguration.
[00:09:12.605 --> 00:09:15.927]  So who knows what's going to be happening there on the ground.
[00:09:16.267 --> 00:09:26.533]  We know we're going to have our reporters there on the ground as well as Alex Jones will be on site, especially at the Deplora Ball and all throughout the weekend reporting, bringing all that news to you live.
[00:09:27.293 --> 00:09:28.274]  Uh, they're on the ground.
[00:09:28.314 --> 00:09:32.857]  So stay tuned to the Alex Jones channel for all of those reports as well as the live streams on YouTube.
[00:09:32.877 --> 00:09:38.020]  Uh, but people are really talking about the landmines that Team Obama is laying for Donald Trump.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:47.467]  Now, as much as Obama wants to say that he wants this to be a smooth transition to the new administration, he's just laying these landmines, just setting things up.
[00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:53.331]  So obviously it was very ironic that, uh, President Obama did this Cuba move.
[00:09:54.269 --> 00:10:08.965]  Given fears that Donald Trump wants to close the door on refugees, but Obama says that he's going to deny to Cubans who flee the island dictatorship the protection that they can get legal residency if they make it to U.S.
[00:10:08.985 --> 00:10:09.326]  soil.
[00:10:09.346 --> 00:10:11.788]  So this was something that was instituted by President Bill Clinton in 1995.
[00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.352]  Obama wants to do away with that.
[00:10:30.948 --> 00:10:36.731]  Well, you're letting all the refugees in and all these people coming from Mexico and Central America and other places.
[00:10:36.751 --> 00:10:40.673]  You're giving them fast track citizenship, but not the Cubans.
[00:10:40.713 --> 00:10:41.534]  I don't understand.
[00:10:41.834 --> 00:10:43.155]  This is a policy that's been in place.
[00:10:43.475 --> 00:10:49.778]  Well, you can kind of see the game that's being played here because they know that it's going to look bad on Trump if he reverses it.
[00:10:51.799 --> 00:10:53.300]  You know, that's likely the real point.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:59.463]  Also, we saw the move there with the UN, where they were condemning Israeli occupation there in Palestine.
[00:10:59.804 --> 00:11:01.525]  So, of course, that's going to complicate U.S.
[00:11:01.585 --> 00:11:05.247]  efforts at the Middle East peace for years to come, maybe decades.
[00:11:05.587 --> 00:11:11.350]  And of course, we know that Donald Trump and his administration is very pro-Israel with their policies.
[00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:16.831]  So, you know, they kind of did that as another thing to just kind of ruffle the feathers.
[00:11:17.852 --> 00:11:22.133]  Interesting, we've got Obama commuting the bulk of Chelsea Manning's sentence.
[00:11:22.193 --> 00:11:32.355]  Now, Chelsea Manning is the Army intelligence analyst who was convicted of an enormous 2010 leak revealing American military and diplomatic activities across the world.
[00:11:32.635 --> 00:11:35.076]  This is what put WikiLeaks on the map, actually.
[00:11:35.116 --> 00:11:35.816]  It made him famous.
[00:11:36.596 --> 00:11:44.722]  So, you know, on the one hand, we've got President Obama saying WikiLeaks are Russian agents being controlled by the Kremlin and we need to do away with them.
[00:11:44.802 --> 00:11:46.823]  Assange is a Russian agent.
[00:11:47.264 --> 00:11:51.346]  But then here we have him commuting the sentence of Chelsea Manning.
[00:11:52.007 --> 00:11:57.150]  So people are saying that, you know, is this a kind of a reversal on the Obama administration's policies?
[00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.812]  They made an unprecedented crackdown on
[00:12:01.093 --> 00:12:04.536]  On whistleblowers, they charged about nine cases.
[00:12:04.556 --> 00:12:08.300]  So that's about twice as many as under all previous residents combined.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.963]  They actually deleted the whistleblower protections from their website.
[00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:17.468]  But Chelsea Manning is set to be freed on May 17th of this year.
[00:12:17.808 --> 00:12:20.871]  She was going to get out in 2045.
[00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:24.254]  So that that's pretty huge there to commute that sentence.
[00:12:24.714 --> 00:12:25.795]  Now it'll be interesting to see
[00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:27.992]  I don't
[00:12:47.372 --> 00:12:54.434]  In the DNC, of course, like this Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who's actually calling for a Trump impeachment.
[00:12:54.474 --> 00:12:57.055]  I'm sure she'd like to see Julian Assange here as well.
[00:12:57.835 --> 00:13:07.918]  But she was calling for Donald Trump to be impeached on the grounds that he coined the term Crooked Hillary in collusion with the Russian government.
[00:13:08.798 --> 00:13:18.125]  This is California Congressman Maxine Waters being egged on by MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews to explain why Trump's presidency is not legitimate.
[00:13:18.565 --> 00:13:26.892]  So she goes on struggling, she says, if we discover that Donald Trump or his advocates played a role to help provide strategy, that's what you do in politics.
[00:13:27.372 --> 00:13:35.140]  She says, if they're the ones who came up with crooked Hillary, if they're the ones who came up with she's ill, something's wrong with her energy.
[00:13:35.421 --> 00:13:40.586]  No, I think it was her collapsing at the 9-11 memorial that finally put all of those rumors to rest.
[00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:46.873]  But if she says, you know, if Donald Trump, the way he basically described Hillary Clinton during the campaign,
[00:13:47.814 --> 00:13:54.237]  I think that would put the question squarely on the table whether or not he should be impeached!
[00:13:54.877 --> 00:14:02.760]  Impeach him for calling her Crooked Hillary, for coining the phrase Crooked Hillary, and for saying that she's sick, she's ill.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.202]  Like I said, those were not conspiracy theories, those were confirmed.
[00:14:06.582 --> 00:14:11.244]  Where did she go after her meteoric ascent there in the polls after the DNC?
[00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:12.864]  She was on bed rest.
[00:14:12.904 --> 00:14:13.505]  She was ill.
[00:14:13.565 --> 00:14:14.245]  She was sick.
[00:14:14.725 --> 00:14:22.808]  This lady thinks we should impeach President Donald Trump and his advocates because of things that happen every single election cycle.
[00:14:22.908 --> 00:14:25.528]  People call people dirty names or whatever.
[00:14:25.548 --> 00:14:27.169]  I mean, this lady is absolutely crazy.
[00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:33.001]  Now we've got President Obama rushing to fill dozens of federal jobs.
[00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:35.382]  So he wants to make sure he keeps his people in.
[00:14:35.422 --> 00:14:38.603]  People are going to stick true to his progressive plan.
[00:14:39.123 --> 00:14:43.525]  He is rushing to fill nearly 100 federal government vacancies.
[00:14:43.845 --> 00:14:47.686]  This is a frenzy of appointments that are happening in his final few weeks in office.
[00:14:47.726 --> 00:14:51.707]  He's already named 72 people to federal job openings, nominated another 17.
[00:14:52.047 --> 00:14:54.428]  These positions require Senate confirmation.
[00:14:55.468 --> 00:15:01.492]  Uh, so this includes several White House officials who will serve well after Obama leaves office.
[00:15:01.552 --> 00:15:08.657]  So again, with these landmines, just wanting to make sure that the proper people are in place to hold true to those progressive policies.
[00:15:08.717 --> 00:15:12.319]  Of course, they're going to be fighting against the Trump administration at every turn.
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.140]  But check this out.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:20.543]  So you remember all those never Trumpers, all the people that signed on these Republicans that put their name on this list?
[00:15:20.823 --> 00:15:25.825]  They are shocked, shocked that they cannot find jobs in Trump's White House.
[00:15:26.426 --> 00:15:27.486]  So this was a list.
[00:15:27.546 --> 00:15:32.148]  This was put out during the presidential campaign scores of national security Republicans.
[00:15:32.548 --> 00:15:33.989]  They're wondering why they they can't.
[00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:35.029]  They seem to get a job.
[00:15:35.049 --> 00:15:37.410]  They're on this do not hire list at the White House.
[00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.271]  These are some of the biggest names in the Republican national security world.
[00:15:41.852 --> 00:15:44.232]  First Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge.
[00:15:44.873 --> 00:15:46.753]  Retired Air Force General Michael Hayden.
[00:15:46.793 --> 00:15:50.094]  He formerly directed the CIA and the NSA.
[00:15:50.134 --> 00:15:51.635]  We got former trade ambassadors.
[00:15:52.495 --> 00:15:55.756]  So, you know, these people were very vocal, spoke out publicly.
[00:15:56.176 --> 00:16:03.459]  They said, we commit ourselves to working energetically to prevent the election of someone so unfederally unfitted to the office.
[00:16:03.979 --> 00:16:07.263]  So they called his trade policies a recipe for disaster.
[00:16:08.024 --> 00:16:13.812]  His view of American influence and power on the world stage is wildly inconsistent, unmoored in principle.
[00:16:14.132 --> 00:16:20.460]  He has utter contempt for Mexico, endangers the safety of Muslims, and he is fundamentally dishonest.
[00:16:21.041 --> 00:16:32.104]  But now those exact same people are sending out their job application and they are surprised to find out that Donald Trump is not interested in hiring them whatsoever.
[00:16:32.124 --> 00:16:36.125]  They say that they have been put on some type of a blacklist.
[00:16:36.505 --> 00:16:42.926]  Some people, they're being told that they've actually been put on an enemies list, that they've just been frozen out.
[00:16:43.006 --> 00:16:50.208]  And that's, you know what, Donald Trump said that plenty of time during his campaigning, that he's very, loyalty is very important to him.
[00:16:50.928 --> 00:16:53.911]  So it's no shocker they're never Trumpers.
[00:16:54.452 --> 00:17:02.940]  Now we also see someone that we're thinking is going to be tussling with Donald Trump a lot is Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:12.549]  Now he is picking a fight with the incoming president over Trump's vow to tackle corruption in Big Pharma.
[00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:18.534]  Why don't we all know that, you know, Paul Ryan is the donor class's man.
[00:17:18.594 --> 00:17:20.356]  He's the donor class's man there on the hill.
[00:17:20.776 --> 00:17:24.919]  So Trump said at a press conference the other day, we've got to get our drug industry coming back.
[00:17:24.979 --> 00:17:26.040]  It's been disastrous.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.201]  They're getting away with murder.
[00:17:27.241 --> 00:17:30.824]  They want to create new bidding procedures so that we can import cheaper drugs.
[00:17:31.564 --> 00:17:36.188]  He said in another interview, they're politically protected, but not anymore.
[00:17:36.608 --> 00:17:40.832]  So, of course, this caused the stocks, big pharma stocks, to totally
[00:17:42.252 --> 00:17:44.373]  People are saying, oh wow, this is what's going to happen.
[00:17:44.393 --> 00:17:52.235]  We're not going to be able to rape and pillage the American consumer anymore because we're going to have to start competing this healthy competition.
[00:17:52.635 --> 00:18:00.638]  And in response to that, Paul Ryan said, you know, I think we need to have more conversations about Trump's efforts to crack down on big pharma.
[00:18:00.658 --> 00:18:05.879]  I believe the current premium support system with Part D, it works extremely well.
[00:18:05.979 --> 00:18:07.620]  I think there's some real success stories.
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.540]  We need to tell those stories.
[00:18:09.801 --> 00:18:19.931]  I think if you see anyone that's posting a picture of their prescriptions, if they're trying to get treated for cancer or something, it's like a thousand dollars for one single prescription.
[00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:21.713]  I think that's out of control.
[00:18:22.093 --> 00:18:27.919]  And then the fact that you make it illegal to get the same exact drug from, say, Canada, Donald Trump thinks that's absurd.
[00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:29.280]  But interestingly enough,
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:37.506]  We have Jamu Green on Tucker Carlson's show last night and she's the frontrunner to become the next head of the DNC.
[00:18:37.906 --> 00:18:47.593]  Well, she didn't even want to answer Tucker Carlson when he pressed and he pressed on, you know, does she agree with the cheaper drug prices that Donald Trump's administration is proposing?
[00:18:48.013 --> 00:18:52.316]  She refused to say even, I don't like Donald Trump, but I can agree with him on this.
[00:18:52.396 --> 00:18:57.380]  So, you know, we're going to see a lot more of this in the coming years, a lot of this infighting.
[00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:00.251]  Stick around, we'll have more nightly news right after this.
[00:19:01.587 --> 00:19:15.655]  Now what I'm announcing here today is already a custom here in the United States, and that is extending the Christmas holiday up until New Year's Eve and then taking down the Christmas trees and taking down the Christmas lights.
[00:19:15.795 --> 00:19:16.855]  Ooh, I keep saying Christmas.
[00:19:17.516 --> 00:19:18.676]  I'm so politically incorrect.
[00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:22.338]  The day after New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
[00:19:22.878 --> 00:19:27.161]  And so I've decided right through New Year's Day, we're going to keep
[00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:45.818]  The virtual Christmas tree or an HD video shot of downtown Austin at the capital of the beautiful Christmas tree up just to upset the social justice warriors and all the little snowflakes that want to bully us into banning our culture and banning free speech.
[00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:49.781]  In fact, there's a war going on, not just online, but in the streets.
[00:19:49.841 --> 00:19:56.425]  I've seen it, where people on the hike and bike trails say Merry Christmas, and then folks don't respond and they say Happy Holidays!
[00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:04.932]  Or even family I have, that I send the message of Merry Christmas to, they respond back with Happy Holidays.
[00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:07.454]  It is some distant cousins, but it's going on.
[00:20:08.325 --> 00:20:18.469]  But we're also going to extend the Christmas sale right through until New Year's Eve, until everything sells out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:30.473]  Now, we normally try to budget things to where, in the warehouse, most of the products sell out by year-end, and the new products come in in a few weeks or a month after, because we have to pay taxes on inventory.
[00:20:31.233 --> 00:20:35.934]  And this year, I've decided to extend the sale until everything completely sells out.
[00:20:36.094 --> 00:20:52.257]  So to be clear, almost every one of our best-selling nutraceutical supplements is selling out, and for a good reason, because here are the specials that we're running until they sell out or until the new year comes here in just about four or five days.
[00:20:52.997 --> 00:20:54.058]  Living Defense, 30% off.

[00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:28.847]  I certainly hope and pray you had a blessed and merry Christmas, and I'm really focusing and working hard to make sure we have a great new year as Americanism, not globalism, accelerates into the future.

[00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:12.091]  Well, we are witnessing a war going on between the intelligence agencies and the incoming president, Donald Trump.
[00:23:12.572 --> 00:23:19.373]  Now, the outgoing CIA chief, John Brennan, has really taken to a war of words with President-elect Donald Trump.
[00:23:20.033 --> 00:23:25.214]  But, you know, he hasn't even read this dossier that came out that BuzzFeed and CNN sort of ran with.
[00:23:25.594 --> 00:23:28.295]  He said he doesn't even feel like giving it any additional airtime.
[00:23:28.715 --> 00:23:28.855]  I don't
[00:23:45.226 --> 00:23:51.067]  Perhaps that Brennan himself might have been responsible for leaking this notorious dossier to the press.
[00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:54.248]  But of course, you know, he's gone on to say, what is this?
[00:23:54.448 --> 00:23:55.488]  You know, Nazi Germany.
[00:23:55.988 --> 00:24:01.009]  So just very interesting watching what's going on with the intelligence agencies.
[00:24:01.709 --> 00:24:05.830]  McCain has actually conceded, come out to say Trump was actually right.
[00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:06.930]  He says he has a point.
[00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.151]  The dossier leak was totally wrong.
[00:24:09.571 --> 00:24:09.791]  We're good.
[00:24:29.986 --> 00:24:30.886]  We're good to go.
[00:24:53.351 --> 00:24:56.213]  And because of that, Mark Adams reached out to us.
[00:24:56.674 --> 00:25:04.760]  Mark Adams has been on the show before, some huge broadcasts that we've done in the past, and he is a point man for members of Congress.
[00:25:05.541 --> 00:25:19.252]  He's worked with whistleblowers from the CIA, the NSA, and the IRS, and he wanted to get on the show just to really break down some of this history as far as the last time we were told to just trust the intelligence agencies no matter what.
[00:25:19.652 --> 00:25:21.174]  There was a time, remember, it was in 2003.
[00:25:23.404 --> 00:25:35.470]  When Secretary of State Colin Powell, he was addressing the Security Council at the United Nations discussing, of course, our pending war with Iraq.
[00:25:36.371 --> 00:25:46.176]  And he told them, he said, every statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources.
[00:25:47.691 --> 00:26:02.479]  Well, in fact, Powell's chief source was a captured Al Qaeda prisoner known as Al Libby and was later reported in the Sunday Herald.
[00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:14.405]  Powell's speech to the United Nations Security Council that was largely based on Al Libby's coerced testimony.
[00:26:16.138 --> 00:26:21.981]  Testimony that was extracted from him in Egyptian torture chambers.
[00:26:23.321 --> 00:26:25.543]  And in fact, many U.S.
[00:26:25.683 --> 00:26:34.807]  intelligence officials questioned the validity of what he was told, of statements that he made where he was literally under torture.
[00:26:36.488 --> 00:26:43.171]  And according to that Sunday Herald article, it was Vice President Dick Cheney.
[00:26:44.827 --> 00:27:06.645]  He ordered the Egyptian torturers to step up their techniques on Al-Libi because he wanted to get a smoking gun linking Iraq with Al-Qaeda so he could justify our invasion of Iraq.
[00:27:08.141 --> 00:27:16.184]  So did that just sort of send chills up your spine when you've been hearing the last few months that we are to trust these 17 intelligence agencies?
[00:27:16.224 --> 00:27:19.304]  They're not going to show us any proof, but their sources say.
[00:27:20.485 --> 00:27:21.965]  What sort of flags were raised for you?
[00:27:23.486 --> 00:27:27.087]  Yes, how can you believe anything they say after that incident?
[00:27:27.767 --> 00:27:28.767]  It wasn't.
[00:27:29.887 --> 00:27:34.829]  Oh gosh, it was sometime later when the Senate Select Committee
[00:27:35.834 --> 00:27:36.214]  That's right.
[00:27:57.057 --> 00:28:06.999]  And of course, now this was one of the, the story says that there's a mystery surrounding the prison death of this terrorist whose testimony was key to the Iraq invasion.
[00:28:08.899 --> 00:28:19.161]  He, again, under this false confession, and then it turns out he is one of the many terrorists who end up committing suicide, allegedly, while being held.
[00:28:20.601 --> 00:28:21.481]  Yes.
[00:28:22.241 --> 00:28:25.382]  After they got this false confession from him,
[00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.331]  The Egyptians turned him over to the CIA.
[00:28:30.592 --> 00:28:34.413]  Then we delivered him to Gaddafi in Libya.
[00:28:35.554 --> 00:28:39.196]  And this is in early 2006, I believe it was.
[00:28:40.196 --> 00:28:46.219]  Then it was around three years later when Human Rights Watch started to investigate this stuff.
[00:28:47.499 --> 00:28:51.501]  And they went to Libya and they interviewed al-Libya.
[00:28:52.261 --> 00:28:53.742]  I think that was in early spring 2009.
[00:28:55.816 --> 00:29:02.599]  And then a month later, they said he abruptly committed suicide.
[00:29:03.399 --> 00:29:04.659]  That's the story we are told.
[00:29:04.679 --> 00:29:06.420]  Because the story was starting to get out.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.881]  The truth was starting to get out.
[00:29:08.161 --> 00:29:13.603]  So this is someone who says, fairly significant figure in the counterterrorism world.
[00:29:13.763 --> 00:29:19.085]  His testimony, I would say, provided the linchpin for the invasion of Iraq.
[00:29:19.105 --> 00:29:21.946]  This is Stacey Sullivan, counterterrorism advisor.
[00:29:22.779 --> 00:29:23.099]  Yes.
[00:29:23.739 --> 00:29:31.903]  And then there was another group, a British group of human rights lawyers, just known by the name of Justice.
[00:29:32.864 --> 00:29:46.450]  And one of their investigators said, Al Libby, he was tortured into making false statements that were relied upon to start the Iraq War.
[00:29:47.911 --> 00:29:51.893]  And when that became too embarrassing, he was then
[00:29:52.762 --> 00:29:57.791]  Disappeared into a rights-abusing country, Libya.
[00:29:59.454 --> 00:30:00.716]  That's our sad history.
[00:30:01.007 --> 00:30:12.035]  Right, and so that's why when we're, you know, looking at John Brennan sort of making these veiled threats or Chuck Schumer making veiled threats to Donald Trump saying they've got six ways this Sunday to take care of you if you go against them.
[00:30:12.556 --> 00:30:26.727]  So not only did we have this false story of weapons of mass destruction coming from James Clapper who says, you know, he's making that personal assessment, he's pretty confident that they're shipping those weapons of mass destruction over the border.
[00:30:27.467 --> 00:30:33.676]  And that wasn't true, even though they lied and told us that they absolutely knew they had weapons of mass destruction there.
[00:30:34.117 --> 00:30:37.321]  Then Dick Cheney is now saying that he has absolute
[00:30:39.045 --> 00:30:52.574]  This absolute smoking gun linking Iraq and Al Qaeda based on the forced testimony of this terrorist who was tortured out of him and he was telling lies basically to avoid torture.
[00:30:52.914 --> 00:31:01.019]  And so this is kind of the validity, the solid evidence, the smoking gun proof that they were using to get us into war with Iraq.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.681]  What won't they do?
[00:31:02.841 --> 00:31:06.003]  What is the agenda then behind this Russian dossier?
[00:31:06.983 --> 00:31:07.624]  How frightening.
[00:31:08.846 --> 00:31:09.867]  They are.
[00:31:10.708 --> 00:31:15.192]  Me, personally, I can't wait until Friday when Trump gets sworn in as president.
[00:31:15.212 --> 00:31:18.395]  I don't know what's going to happen between now and then.
[00:31:20.216 --> 00:31:21.017]  Well, I feel it.
[00:31:21.037 --> 00:31:27.242]  I think a lot of people are kind of just by holding their breath until 12 noon on Friday, 12 noon Eastern.
[00:31:30.865 --> 00:31:40.029]  Now we've got about a minute left here and I know in this next segment we're going to talk a little bit about the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay.
[00:31:40.369 --> 00:31:57.117]  Obviously President Obama is releasing even more Gitmo detainees despite an estimated 30% of them returning to terrorism and you know you think that this is a good thing that we need to be shutting this down based on the fact that we are torturing the prisoners that are held there and then
[00:31:57.657 --> 00:32:03.261]  He's using their torture testimony to justify going to war invading other countries.
[00:32:03.761 --> 00:32:05.382]  So we'll get to that in just a minute.
[00:32:05.422 --> 00:32:13.127]  But any kind of closing comments here for this segment on, you know, trusting the intelligence community and any words of wisdom for Donald Trump?
[00:32:14.241 --> 00:32:23.347]  Well, gosh, later on this month, I think you folks are scheduled to have John Kiriakou appear on InfoWars.
[00:32:23.847 --> 00:32:30.812]  He was a CIA field officer who blew the whistle on how we were torturing people.
[00:32:32.033 --> 00:32:35.235]  And they reveled him to prison for what he said.
[00:32:36.876 --> 00:32:40.038]  And I know InfoWars is going to have a whole big expose on that.
[00:32:40.848 --> 00:32:46.930]  And I hope that Donald Trump listens to what John Kiriakou has to say to your audience.
[00:33:02.273 --> 00:33:03.614]  Wars are not cheap.
[00:33:04.214 --> 00:33:07.935]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:11.591]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[00:33:12.132 --> 00:33:13.133]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[00:33:13.153 --> 00:33:14.594]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:22.040]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:26.784]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[00:33:27.364 --> 00:33:36.432]  That's why on major third-party sites, we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[00:33:37.383 --> 00:33:49.015]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically, and try to free this republic and the world.
[00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:50.997]  We apply to the problems we bring.
[00:33:52.042 --> 00:33:58.425]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[00:33:59.046 --> 00:34:03.368]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[00:34:03.388 --> 00:34:04.668]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:07.150]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've...
[00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:08.090]  I think so.
[00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:27.006]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[00:34:27.426 --> 00:34:28.386]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[00:34:28.406 --> 00:34:30.707]  I dedicated myself to working out and I was in great shape.
[00:34:30.727 --> 00:34:31.788]  I've been dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[00:34:31.808 --> 00:34:36.950]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.691]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:34:38.711 --> 00:34:41.332]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[00:34:41.513 --> 00:34:46.275]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:34:46.855 --> 00:34:56.664]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[00:34:56.684 --> 00:34:57.485]  170-plus studies.
[00:34:57.505 --> 00:34:58.486]  We can make claims on this.
[00:34:58.526 --> 00:34:59.146]  This thing is like...
[00:35:00.165 --> 00:35:00.605]  We're good to go.
[00:35:21.698 --> 00:35:26.442]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[00:35:26.823 --> 00:35:31.567]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.
[00:35:31.927 --> 00:35:33.389]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.

[00:35:37.812 --> 00:35:39.434]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.

[00:35:43.077 --> 00:35:44.278]  Prostagard, 20% off.
[00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:46.500]  And many others at Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.361 --> 00:35:59.372]  You are literally energizing this operation against the globalists, so I want to, again, salute you all and ask you to go check out the amazing specials we've got running right now for 2017 in the month of January.
[00:35:59.592 --> 00:36:00.653]  Make our bodies great again.
[00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.321]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[00:36:04.901 --> 00:36:06.241]  It's like lightning in a bottle!
[00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:10.022]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[00:36:10.382 --> 00:36:18.125]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[00:36:18.325 --> 00:36:23.126]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:28.748]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[00:36:29.108 --> 00:36:36.631]  Seeker 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:41.333]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:36:41.594 --> 00:36:50.437]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:36:50.618 --> 00:36:53.859]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[00:36:54.159 --> 00:36:57.842]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at Infowarslife.com.
[00:36:58.062 --> 00:37:02.725]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:37:04.286 --> 00:37:08.349]  Roger, I know you don't like to speculate, but I mean you've been sitting there, you've known about this for weeks.
[00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:10.451]  Polonium poisoning, it's big.
[00:37:11.031 --> 00:37:15.354]  Let's talk about you, let's talk about why you're... I mean, I'm not trying to put you down.
[00:37:15.394 --> 00:37:17.636]  I mean, I can physically see that you've been sick.
[00:37:17.896 --> 00:37:19.457]  We've seen the photos, what it did to you.
[00:37:19.477 --> 00:37:20.078]  I mean,
[00:37:21.437 --> 00:37:24.081]  It really hit you hard, and I know it has long-term effects.
[00:37:24.982 --> 00:37:26.304]  Just other points on polonium.
[00:37:27.756 --> 00:37:35.480]  Well, look, we get down to the fundamental question of who would have done this and why, and I come back to the deep state.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.540]  I come back to our own people.
[00:37:37.941 --> 00:37:41.202]  The Russians have no motive to kill me.
[00:37:41.262 --> 00:37:45.224]  They have nothing to hide or cover, as far as I am concerned.
[00:37:45.644 --> 00:37:52.767]  And I am not aware of any contact between the Russians and my colleague of many years, Paul Manafort.
[00:37:53.548 --> 00:37:55.729]  And the entire canard about
[00:37:57.228 --> 00:38:01.791]  His activities in the Ukraine and his taking a $12 million payment.
[00:38:02.212 --> 00:38:09.817]  Politico has recently reported, Ken Vogel specifically, that that is now thought to have been bogus.
[00:38:10.377 --> 00:38:13.360]  It was a fake handwritten ledger they found on the side of the street.
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.120]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:21.886]  It was manufactured by Ukrainian intelligence in an effort to undermine... Who now have been caught campaigning and giving money to Hillary.
[00:38:23.447 --> 00:38:36.404]  So this is part and parcel of a greater effort to destabilize President Trump as he tries to bring drastic change.
[00:38:38.113 --> 00:38:53.405]  There was an excellent report on WBAI in New York, a progressive station, about Trump's comments regarding reforming the CIA, cutting the number of agents at Langley, building a system that is more responsive.
[00:38:54.026 --> 00:39:00.351]  The CIA has been associated with some of the greatest atrocities and lies of the last
[00:39:01.011 --> 00:39:01.391]  40 years.
[00:39:01.411 --> 00:39:08.054]  And they're famous for poisoning people, so you're clearly saying rogue elements of that are obviously suspect.
[00:39:08.074 --> 00:39:15.778]  They've been in the news warning Trump and the Associated Press and Reuters, the New York Observer of all places, his son-in-law's paper.
[00:39:16.118 --> 00:39:16.938]  You better watch it.
[00:39:16.978 --> 00:39:18.959]  The intelligence agency can do things to you.
[00:39:19.239 --> 00:39:24.562]  Well, then, if you've been good buddies with him for 41 years, then I think that's a message to Trump.
[00:39:24.822 --> 00:39:26.963]  Isn't this really a message to Donald Trump?
[00:39:27.683 --> 00:39:29.164]  Well, Alex, people who will
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:35.705]  Torture people illegally and then lie about it will, of course, poison people.
[00:39:36.246 --> 00:39:39.048]  People who will cover up Benghazi.
[00:39:39.569 --> 00:39:42.692]  People who lied about Iran-Contra.
[00:39:43.132 --> 00:39:45.534]  People who lied about Vietnam.
[00:39:46.015 --> 00:39:49.138]  People who lied about the Kennedy assassination.
[00:39:50.319 --> 00:39:53.201]  People who lied about the Iraq War.
[00:39:54.022 --> 00:39:58.946]  These people will do anything to cover their record of malfeasance.
[00:39:59.166 --> 00:40:04.070]  Nobody wants me to testify before their phony congressional investigation.
[00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:08.573]  Because I will put the lie to this whole Russian canard.
[00:40:08.973 --> 00:40:16.439]  That they are so, the deep state and the intelligence agencies are so desperate they won't drop this theme.
[00:40:16.519 --> 00:40:22.304]  Now I point out to you Alex, it was a talking point for Hillary's talking heads before the election.
[00:40:23.622 --> 00:40:28.365]  The CIA Director Brennan warned of Russian hacking before it happens.
[00:40:28.545 --> 00:40:29.985]  Hold on, this gets worse, this gets worse.
[00:40:30.005 --> 00:40:30.726]  New York Post.
[00:40:30.906 --> 00:40:37.569]  The MI6 guy worked with the murdered Levanenko guy that got hit with polonium.
[00:40:38.029 --> 00:40:39.530]  I was already connecting the two.
[00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.071]  Holy Toledo Daily Mail.
[00:40:41.611 --> 00:40:47.934]  Out is the man behind the dirty dossier of Donald Trump, which they admit is now fake, worked with the double-triple agent.
[00:40:48.234 --> 00:40:54.376]  I remember at the time it came out that experts believed that there was no reason for Russia to kill this guy, that it was done to embarrass Russia.
[00:40:54.676 --> 00:40:55.737]  This is crazy!
[00:40:56.597 --> 00:41:03.200]  Well, look, it occurs to me that the people who created that document
[00:41:04.232 --> 00:41:05.432]  Should be ashamed of themselves.
[00:41:05.472 --> 00:41:05.993]  Look at that guy.
[00:41:06.013 --> 00:41:07.273]  He thinks he's so frickin' smart.
[00:41:07.393 --> 00:41:12.155]  Well, if 007 thinks he's so damn smart and wants to be taken seriously, he might learn how to spell.
[00:41:13.115 --> 00:41:17.937]  Their dossier is rife with misspellings.
[00:41:17.977 --> 00:41:19.317]  It wasn't even good for ass-wiping.
[00:41:19.878 --> 00:41:31.902]  So, the idea that James Clapper and the boys down at Langley would include this in a report to President Obama and President Trump, this is a vile
[00:41:32.882 --> 00:41:33.583]  Fraud!
[00:41:33.643 --> 00:41:44.131]  By the way, I'm told by three sources, low-level, mid-level, and high-level in the CIA, that the whole agency hates the globalists, wants America to be great, they hate Hillary, they hate it all.
[00:41:44.191 --> 00:41:49.916]  They say, and I was told this weeks ago, this is all farmed out to subgroups, PR firms, as later came out.
[00:41:50.236 --> 00:41:51.437]  I forgot how accurate their info was.
[00:41:51.657 --> 00:41:52.418]  It's all completely fake.
[00:41:52.578 --> 00:41:53.759]  So it isn't even the CIA.
[00:41:54.419 --> 00:41:55.520]  The CIA doesn't like this.
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.742]  I think that's why the globalists are in so much trouble.
[00:41:57.982 --> 00:41:59.804]  Their own agencies have turned against them.
[00:42:00.504 --> 00:42:10.792]  Well, and it would be outrageously unfair to say that everybody who works for the Central Intelligence Agency is in league with the globalist agenda.
[00:42:10.852 --> 00:42:19.919]  No, there are patriotic Americans that work there, just as there are many, many, many non-political patriotic Americans who work for the FBI.
[00:42:20.519 --> 00:42:23.582]  But the leadership of these agencies are rotten to the core.
[00:42:36.758 --> 00:42:37.459]  We're good to go.
[00:42:47.201 --> 00:43:05.488]  The foreign banker-backed globalist machine constructed by the military-industrial complex, led by Manchurian candidate puppets, and falsely legitimized by the dying Mockingbird mainstream media is collapsing as the wrench of populism lands squarely in its gears.
[00:43:05.848 --> 00:43:08.969]  The World Economic Forum's paranoid Davismen
[00:43:09.369 --> 00:43:14.572]  ...are meeting once again this week, desperately protecting their globalist agenda.
[00:43:14.813 --> 00:43:21.297]  We meet here at an extraordinary moment of history.
[00:43:22.577 --> 00:43:37.006]  We are in the midst of a deep transformation, sometimes disruptive transformation, of business models, of economies, of society, of politics.
[00:43:37.987 --> 00:43:42.692]  President-elect Trump says he's going to assign his son-in-law to the peace process.
[00:43:43.233 --> 00:43:56.508]  His expertise seems to be that he once went to Jewish summer camp and all of a sudden the anxieties that you describe so effectively in your book and have for years are targeting certain
[00:43:57.489 --> 00:44:01.892]  People in political life to blame the wrong target.
[00:44:02.852 --> 00:44:07.195]  And I can't wait to see how the incoming administration deals with AI.
[00:44:07.595 --> 00:44:16.800]  And this current process I think is very, very risky and I think it emboldens people who would love to see Europe divided against itself.
[00:44:17.041 --> 00:44:24.225]  You have a Congress and an executive that has possibly a particular philosophical outlook, let's put it politely.
[00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:29.512]  And a Fed that might have a slightly different philosophical outlook as well.
[00:44:29.713 --> 00:44:31.794]  There has been a lot of discussion in the U.S.
[00:44:31.894 --> 00:44:36.236]  about increasing coal production and putting coal workers back to work.
[00:44:36.656 --> 00:44:38.937]  The question is, who's going to buy that coal?
[00:44:39.338 --> 00:44:44.060]  Because as we heard, we hear a lot about the return of populism and the advanced economies.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.421]  We've seen Brexit.
[00:44:45.881 --> 00:44:51.044]  We've seen the presidential election in the United States.
[00:44:52.865 --> 00:44:58.508]  And we are concerned about the forthcoming elections in Europe.
[00:44:58.708 --> 00:45:10.334]  In an environment in which populism is on the rise in advanced economies, we really haven't touched about the possibility that this could be a contagious phenomenon.
[00:45:12.275 --> 00:45:30.575]  And that some of the political risks that emerging markets face, especially in the worst scenario, in which trade barriers and the like win the day, would be moving away from
[00:45:33.078 --> 00:45:43.460]  Open market economies to retrenching into populism and retrenching into policy reversals.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:50.161]  The elite have gone so far as to use anti-drone technology to protect their scheming hovel.
[00:45:50.341 --> 00:46:00.583]  Zero Hedge reports, it's not FCC certified as we write this, so you can't legally operate one in the US unless you're with the government.
[00:46:00.763 --> 00:46:11.325]  Setting the stage for the first ever visit from a Chinese head of state to Davos, President Xi Jinping unloaded on the anti-globalization sweeping the world.
[00:46:11.405 --> 00:46:16.706]  It is true that economic globalization has created new problems.
[00:46:16.926 --> 00:46:23.627]  But this is no justification to write off economic globalization altogether.
[00:46:25.187 --> 00:46:29.148]  Rather, we should adapt to and guide economic globalization.
[00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.350]  We're good.
[00:47:03.024 --> 00:47:11.171]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.151 --> 00:47:20.958]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.379 --> 00:47:25.222]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:28.304]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.324 --> 00:47:29.825]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin on the back and it says with a cross-throne, you know an X like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.869 --> 00:47:43.990]  It says deport Soros on the bottom and on the top it says InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:52.553]  So it is a limited edition deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:53.473]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.493 --> 00:47:54.533]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.626 --> 00:49:02.287]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:08.359 --> 00:49:16.826]  Well once again we are seeing ads all over the internet in multiple cities offering people paid jobs to protest Donald Trump.
[00:49:16.886 --> 00:49:19.128]  I'm joined by Maggie Howell here to talk about this.
[00:49:19.188 --> 00:49:27.215]  Now this came out before it turned out in some instances to be fake news, in other instances it wasn't proven fake news, but now it's all over the internet.
[00:49:27.455 --> 00:49:28.276]  It is real my friend.
[00:49:28.316 --> 00:49:44.008]  So these ads popping up in over two dozen places that I found, they're normally on a place like Backpage, these internet ads where you post shady stuff, exotic massages for example, this is where you can find this kind of stuff, because I'm assuming that they want a specific sort of
[00:49:44.868 --> 00:49:52.296]  I'm not passing judgment on anyone, but that's where you can find it.
[00:49:52.637 --> 00:49:58.283]  And their ads are advertising $2,500 plus and these are Democratic groups.
[00:49:58.323 --> 00:50:00.005]  One of them is San Francisco based.
[00:50:00.505 --> 00:50:04.710]  It's billing itself as the largest private grassroots support organization in the US.
[00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:05.471]  You know what?
[00:50:05.991 --> 00:50:08.774]  You don't pay people if it's grassroots, frankly.
[00:50:08.814 --> 00:50:17.362]  That's called Soros-type style paid aggravators, sort of like the Maidan in the Ukraine and what we saw there with the chaos and skull-cracking.
[00:50:17.382 --> 00:50:20.064]  That's what they're calling for here, which is basically terrorism.
[00:50:20.385 --> 00:50:26.390]  Well, you know, I just realized this and we were joking about this before the segment, but actually this is Donald Trump creating more jobs.
[00:50:27.331 --> 00:50:29.532]  People are getting paid to protest Donald Trump.
[00:50:29.572 --> 00:50:30.852]  He's creating more jobs.
[00:50:31.253 --> 00:50:36.494]  But on a serious note though, we know that they're getting paid to protest now and we've seen it before.
[00:50:36.815 --> 00:50:38.755]  Project Veritas has exposed that in the past.
[00:50:39.015 --> 00:50:43.737]  Now with the new Project Veritas videos, we know what they're planning on doing.
[00:50:43.757 --> 00:50:48.919]  Well this group, this Disrupt J20, which is something that... They're planning illegal activity.
[00:50:49.239 --> 00:50:49.519]  Correct.
[00:50:49.599 --> 00:50:50.800]  Okay, so he exposed it.
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:52.640]  A comet ping pong of all places.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:56.342]  Mike Cernovich took the periscope and he said, look, we're going to be pressing.
[00:50:56.362 --> 00:50:58.623]  We filed a criminal complaint against you with the FBI.
[00:50:58.923 --> 00:51:00.724]  We understand that you were guests of the deplorable.
[00:51:00.744 --> 00:51:01.724]  They had registered tickets.
[00:51:01.764 --> 00:51:03.225]  They were planning a terrorist activity.
[00:51:03.245 --> 00:51:06.206]  They were going to release this Burek, however you say it, excuse me.
[00:51:06.546 --> 00:51:09.087]  My acid knowledge, forgive me, but it's the
[00:51:09.087 --> 00:51:13.093]  It's a chemical acid and it can cause a lot of harm and cause chaos.
[00:51:13.173 --> 00:51:13.894]  Right, exactly.
[00:51:13.934 --> 00:51:18.441]  So they bought tickets to this Deplorable, which you will be in attendance, Leigh-Anne, and I will be covering it from Austin.
[00:51:18.481 --> 00:51:20.764]  And I was always worried about this exact type of crap.
[00:51:20.784 --> 00:51:20.924]  I know!
[00:51:21.105 --> 00:51:22.927]  I remember you talking about just the concern.
[00:51:24.369 --> 00:51:24.989]  Tip of the cap.
[00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.469]  Cheers.
[00:51:25.909 --> 00:51:27.810]  Just thank God for Project Veritas.
[00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:28.490]  Seriously.
[00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:28.950]  Amazing.
[00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:32.391]  Well, not only that, but you know, they're exposing James O'Keefe.
[00:51:32.471 --> 00:51:33.632]  You talk about the tip of the sphere.
[00:51:33.692 --> 00:51:36.252]  Exposing these corrupt bad actors.
[00:51:36.372 --> 00:51:42.114]  Some would say bastards, frankly, and forgive me, but you know, there are specific words for these types of people.
[00:51:42.134 --> 00:51:43.014]  Well, the word is criminals.
[00:51:43.214 --> 00:51:44.275]  They need to be arrested.
[00:51:44.415 --> 00:51:44.715]  Thank you.
[00:51:44.755 --> 00:51:45.415]  Terrorists!
[00:51:45.855 --> 00:51:56.164]  Make an example of these people, and you know what, technically the definition of terrorism is somebody who plans violence in order to gain politically, to create fear for political gains.
[00:51:56.184 --> 00:51:58.005]  I mean, that's essentially what these people are doing.
[00:51:58.266 --> 00:52:10.696]  But whatever, you know, we can get into semantics here, they need to at least, at least be detained, at least be brought into custody and questioned, if not totally arrested, because what they were doing, or what they were planning on doing, was illegal.
[00:52:11.356 --> 00:52:22.146]  Not only that, but doesn't the city that Trump, he doesn't have any actual, he's got a few detractors like Rosie O'Donnell for example, but they gotta pay people because that's how much people dislike Trump.
[00:52:22.266 --> 00:52:24.408]  You gotta pay them so that they go riot.
[00:52:25.388 --> 00:52:25.629]  Wow.
[00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:26.209]  Just wow.
[00:52:26.449 --> 00:52:32.274]  You know what, he is creating jobs and I know you put this article in, this General Motors piece, do you want to get to it or should we just go down the line?
[00:52:32.555 --> 00:52:36.978]  Well, let's go ahead actually first, let's talk about the fake polls before we get into the new jobs.
[00:52:37.859 --> 00:52:41.642]  Okay, everybody knows that Donald Trump talked about rigged polls.
[00:52:42.122 --> 00:52:49.328]  Everybody, of course, found out eventually that all these polls saying Hillary by this much, 99% chance for Hillary, they all ended up being wrong.
[00:52:49.368 --> 00:52:50.589]  The people that told you the polls were rigged.
[00:52:50.609 --> 00:52:55.512]  Washington Post, number one purveyor of the fake news poll, by the way, I'm calling you out right now.
[00:52:55.532 --> 00:52:56.393]  ABC, they were all on there.
[00:52:56.433 --> 00:52:57.434]  Shameless, shameless.
[00:52:57.534 --> 00:53:07.261]  And what they're doing, he's saying, look, the same polls that were rigged against me in the primary, then in the election cycle, same people doing the polling, folks, they're oversampling the same little group.
[00:53:07.762 --> 00:53:08.743]  Well, this is the perfect thing.
[00:53:08.843 --> 00:53:18.714]  Just like we caught them red-handed with the sampling on the polls for the presidential election, now they're running favorability polls or approval rating polls on Donald Trump.
[00:53:18.894 --> 00:53:19.895]  First of all, I love this.
[00:53:20.636 --> 00:53:26.883]  The guy hasn't even been president yet and you're running polls on his favorability.
[00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:28.645]  You're running polls on his approval.
[00:53:28.945 --> 00:53:30.706]  He hasn't even been inaugurated!
[00:53:31.127 --> 00:53:31.967]  He's not even in!
[00:53:32.248 --> 00:53:35.250]  In fact, you're trying to do everything possible to keep him out!
[00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:50.001]  So they're here running these polls, he's not even in yet, yet he's doing all these positive things, and so I guess it's like he already is president, so now we're gonna have to run these polls, but just like before, they've been exposed on how they cook these polls, caught him red-handed.
[00:53:50.161 --> 00:53:53.224]  And the best thing is, Donald Trump called him out on Twitter!
[00:53:53.544 --> 00:53:55.105]  I love when I saw that this morning.
[00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:56.886]  You know what, I can't get enough of this Twitter feed myself.
[00:53:57.186 --> 00:54:05.868]  We're talking about the same phony, illegitimate, illegitimate, they're calling him illegitimate when they're actually the ones that are totally fake.
[00:54:06.028 --> 00:54:09.529]  And these phony election polls, they were wrong before, wrong now.
[00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:13.691]  There is no disapproval rating unless they're polling the same 20 people that voted for Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:13.711 --> 00:54:15.211]  You're having to work for the Washington Post.
[00:54:15.671 --> 00:54:16.471]  That's who we're talking about.
[00:54:16.491 --> 00:54:21.573]  You know, there needs to be, there needs to be like a new graphic or a new comic where
[00:54:22.591 --> 00:54:32.077]  The mainstream media or the Washington Post, the ABC who runs these polls, all these people, they need to have like a gun that they're holding to themselves.
[00:54:32.137 --> 00:54:34.879]  I mean, they continue to commit political suicide.
[00:54:35.239 --> 00:54:38.721]  They continue to commit basically media suicide.
[00:54:38.741 --> 00:54:39.602]  Professional suicide.
[00:54:39.622 --> 00:54:41.223]  I mean, who's going to listen to them?
[00:54:41.283 --> 00:54:44.065]  They're so fake and so wrong.
[00:54:44.085 --> 00:54:44.925]  99 point.
[00:54:44.945 --> 00:54:45.226]  You know what?
[00:54:45.246 --> 00:54:46.426]  They should do a poll on themselves.
[00:54:46.466 --> 00:54:48.268]  How many times they actually predict a correct poll.
[00:54:49.108 --> 00:54:49.508]  I mean, honestly.
[00:54:49.528 --> 00:54:50.128]  Zero percent?
[00:54:50.288 --> 00:54:50.788]  Probably.
[00:54:50.808 --> 00:54:52.109]  They'd have a zero percent margin.
[00:54:52.129 --> 00:54:57.670]  It's like, okay, here's our poll before the presidential election that we were running.
[00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:59.170]  Totally rigged.
[00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:01.531]  That's our suicide, running these fake polls.
[00:55:01.651 --> 00:55:02.831]  Okay, that blew up in her face.
[00:55:03.071 --> 00:55:06.472]  Then they pull out a bigger gun to shoot themselves in the foot with.
[00:55:06.512 --> 00:55:09.212]  Well, we got caught rigging the polls on the presidential election.
[00:55:09.572 --> 00:55:11.653]  Let's just rig the polls on Trump's favorability.
[00:55:11.673 --> 00:55:13.493]  Let's try to discredit him with these fake polls.
[00:55:14.353 --> 00:55:16.335]  Oh, we caught you again!
[00:55:16.835 --> 00:55:18.116]  People aren't buying this anymore.
[00:55:18.136 --> 00:55:18.396]  They're not.
[00:55:18.416 --> 00:55:22.339]  The cover of Drudge, and forgive me, I didn't have this article prepped, but I want to talk about it now because it's relevant to this.
[00:55:22.639 --> 00:55:27.382]  The New York Times, they're scaling back like never before, cutting their staff, losing their offices.
[00:55:27.502 --> 00:55:31.705]  Gee, I wonder why nobody reads you and your fake garbage.
[00:55:31.765 --> 00:55:36.348]  But they hire the self-admitted political hacks from Politico.
[00:55:36.428 --> 00:55:37.769]  That's right.
[00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:41.072]  And the Russian hacked WikiLeaks that no one's ever denied are real.
[00:55:42.233 --> 00:55:46.597]  Meanwhile, we've seen Putin today call our press worse than hookers.
[00:55:46.657 --> 00:55:58.068]  He's saying that our press... And not to agree with Putin, because God forbid I agree with the devil, but apparently, you know, even the global stage, the world knows that they're full of garbage.
[00:55:58.809 --> 00:55:59.670]  Much like the rest of us do.
[00:56:29.129 --> 00:56:31.531]  So this is what we have to put up with now, I guess.
[00:56:31.951 --> 00:56:34.913]  And of course, here's the reason, the unprecedented security.
[00:56:34.973 --> 00:56:41.296]  Obviously, we know about the unprecedented threats that are coming to this inauguration, but also the unprecedented amount of people.
[00:56:41.396 --> 00:56:54.684]  I'm expecting there to be more than a million people down there in Washington, D.C., making it even more difficult on security detail, police, to maintain civil, everybody cooperating, which I don't expect is going to happen.
[00:56:54.764 --> 00:56:56.865]  I think that the left is planning some serious attacks.
[00:56:56.905 --> 00:56:57.906]  We already know what they're planning.
[00:56:58.466 --> 00:57:03.429]  But hopefully the police, FBI, whoever else is involved, Secret Service can keep things under control.
[00:57:03.469 --> 00:57:13.355]  Now, before we let you go here, gotta take you, let's take a magical trip into Jobland with magic wands, where Donald Trump is waving wands.
[00:57:13.375 --> 00:57:16.217]  Hey Mr. President, Mr. President, what do you think about the Russian hacking?
[00:57:16.437 --> 00:57:18.258]  We're gonna bring it back to jobs.
[00:57:18.879 --> 00:57:19.920]  So here's what we got.
[00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:20.900]  We got two more things.
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:26.064]  China's richest man is going to continue to invest a lot of money in the United States.
[00:57:26.544 --> 00:57:35.351]  He was speaking today at the Davos World Economic Forum and he plans on continuing to invest in entertainment in the United States.
[00:57:36.071 --> 00:57:37.853]  Billions of dollars in fact.
[00:57:38.413 --> 00:57:39.434]  So how do you like that?
[00:57:39.534 --> 00:57:42.938]  We're not in a hostile environment anymore where businesses are discouraged.
[00:57:43.119 --> 00:57:57.437]  I mean, you know, you'd think that that message would permeate the brains of these idiots who are running these fake polls, but not to mention, you mentioned this one Chinese investor, there was a second one, his name escapes me, but he manufactures glass, he's doing this in Ohio, he's moving
[00:57:58.098 --> 00:57:59.739]  Large portion of his business to Ohio.
[00:57:59.919 --> 00:58:07.181]  Also, GM, you know, we weren't sure where they were building those cruises, but it looks like they're going to actually invest money into the U.S.
[00:58:07.201 --> 00:58:07.481]  economy.
[00:58:07.501 --> 00:58:11.942]  They're promising $1 billion, confirming this initial investment into U.S.
[00:58:12.002 --> 00:58:13.563]  factories in 2017.
[00:58:13.843 --> 00:58:20.385]  They're going to start removing parts of their factory work from Mexico back to the U.S.
[00:58:20.565 --> 00:58:22.506]  So just more magic wand jobs.
[00:58:24.068 --> 00:58:29.211]  A billionaire in China is going to make the United States a top priority for investment opportunities.
[00:58:29.271 --> 00:58:33.954]  GM to bring back a billion dollars in additional U.S.
[00:58:33.994 --> 00:58:35.435]  So this is big.
[00:58:35.675 --> 00:58:39.177]  1,500 jobs is what we're talking about with this GM investiture.
[00:58:39.398 --> 00:58:39.177]  1,500.
[00:58:39.418 --> 00:58:41.759]  Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs.
[00:58:41.899 --> 00:58:43.120]  And it's all, I love the left.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:47.442]  Thank you, Obama, for creating this wonderful meme of, what is that?
[00:58:47.543 --> 00:58:48.223]  Trumpledore.
[00:58:48.443 --> 00:58:49.063]  Trumpledore.
[00:58:49.344 --> 00:58:50.724]  That's going to do it for the nightly news.
[00:58:51.225 --> 00:58:52.826]  You stay classy, InfoWarriors.
[00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:09.935]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.395 --> 00:59:20.123]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.443 --> 00:59:24.186]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
