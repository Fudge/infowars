[00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:35.448]  Tonight, what is it about illegal that you don't understand?
[00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:54.927]  Leftist organizers across the country told illegal and legal immigrants to stay home and miss work or school so they could send a message to President Trump and the rest of the country about what America looks like during a day without immigrants.
[00:00:55.467 --> 00:01:06.773]  Meanwhile, the White House denies reports that President Trump is considering mobilizing 100,000 National Guard troops to help out with mass deportation.
[00:01:07.054 --> 00:01:21.782]  Plus, the showdown in Texas continues as Texas Governor Greg Abbott makes good on his promise to cut funding to Travis County because the liberal-loving sheriff allows sanctuary cities.
[00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:23.583]  All that plus much more, up next!

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.592 --> 00:03:11.195]  Well yesterday saw nationwide social justice boycotts, a day without immigrants.
[00:03:11.935 --> 00:03:13.997]  I don't know how it was for you all out there.
[00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:21.721]  I know here in Austin, Texas there was very little traffic and it was actually the most delightful day I've ever had at the grocery store.
[00:03:22.321 --> 00:03:23.441]  Got in and out like that.
[00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:27.783]  So I'm not really sure how it was supposed to affect us all.
[00:03:29.243 --> 00:03:41.288]  But of course, this was something that was done to send a message to President Trump that people are fed up with his immigration policies and this proposed wall that he wants to build.
[00:03:42.048 --> 00:03:48.295]  But the issue that I'm having with it is that it is combining everyone into this group of immigrants.
[00:03:48.775 --> 00:03:51.078]  Legal immigrants with illegal immigrants.
[00:03:51.438 --> 00:03:52.920]  And there's a huge difference.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.623]  Donald Trump is not trying to deport immigrants.
[00:03:55.763 --> 00:03:58.306]  He'd be deporting more than half the country, I'm sure.
[00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:01.107]  So this is where people were kind of confused.
[00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:09.830]  Millie Weaver was there in attendance yesterday and she was actually speaking with some of these protesters who were agreeing with Donald Trump's policies.
[00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.512]  So they understand that, yeah, people shouldn't be here illegally.
[00:04:13.552 --> 00:04:14.892]  We are a nation of laws.
[00:04:15.072 --> 00:04:24.736]  If not, you know, then we could just turn into Mexico or some other country where these people are fleeing because they're not run by the rule of law and their economy and countries are crumbling.
[00:04:25.436 --> 00:04:36.470]  So this is something that leftist organizers and businesses across America were actually pushing this out there, telling all immigrants, legal and illegal, stay home, miss worker class.
[00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.398]  A lot of schools are reporting very low attendance aimed at Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.
[00:04:44.239 --> 00:04:59.363]  And this protest affected the restaurant and hospitality industries the most because according to Restaurant Opportunities Centers United an estimated 1.3 million illegal aliens actually work in the restaurant industry alone.
[00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:02.564]  So that is where you probably saw the greatest
[00:05:04.184 --> 00:05:04.825]  We're good.
[00:05:20.623 --> 00:05:22.245]  I'm scared, but here's the thing.
[00:05:22.285 --> 00:05:29.692]  I mean, if you are here illegally in this country, you already know there is a possibility that if you overstay your visa, you're gonna get kicked out.
[00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:33.576]  I can't go to any other country without going through the visa process.
[00:05:33.956 --> 00:05:38.481]  It doesn't matter if I bring a lot of money there, if I'm a really nice person, or I make a good life for myself.
[00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:40.263]  If you overstay your visa,
[00:05:40.643 --> 00:05:43.124]  You're going to get deported, possibly fined.
[00:05:43.364 --> 00:05:47.606]  And I know in a lot of countries in Europe, they bar you for life.
[00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:48.907]  You can never go back there.
[00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:52.709]  So the people are only upset about it when it's here in the United States.
[00:05:53.209 --> 00:06:01.153]  But they're really pushing this out to stoke fear and, of course, try to dismantle Trump's agenda, say his administration is about to crumble.
[00:06:01.173 --> 00:06:04.794]  And so they're ramping up these stories of these ICE raids.
[00:06:05.155 --> 00:06:05.975]  I know it was all
[00:06:06.295 --> 00:06:16.821]  People over social media, people were posting these flyers saying, oh, ICE is here, ICE is there, watch out for raids, letting people know how to deal with these ICE officers if they were to come to their home.
[00:06:16.841 --> 00:06:18.762]  A lot of people, just a lot of panic.
[00:06:19.302 --> 00:06:19.943]  And now U.S.
[00:06:20.603 --> 00:06:26.907]  Immigration and Customs Enforcement is actually pushing back against the media saying, stop reporting this fake news.
[00:06:27.247 --> 00:06:30.089]  In fact, President Obama grabbed 350% more people at once.
[00:06:30.109 --> 00:06:30.949]  They said the media
[00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:41.513]  Is putting out dangerous and irresponsible reporting, calling out the Washington Post and others.
[00:06:42.293 --> 00:06:50.499]  And the agency made about 683 arrests of mostly criminal illegal immigrants or those with multiple cases against them.
[00:06:51.099 --> 00:07:02.887]  And so then they tweeted out a throwback Thursday, April 2012, ICE arrests more than 3,100 convicted criminal aliens and immigration fugitives in nationwide ops.
[00:07:02.947 --> 00:07:05.089]  So they were really trying to make their point
[00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:22.403]  That, why weren't people upset then, when they made this massive sweep in the nation, drew very little media coverage, very little outrage, because, you know, it was President Obama, and he's doing the job that he's supposed to, and enforcing our immigration laws here.
[00:07:22.604 --> 00:07:25.606]  No uproar then, and it was a 350% more during this nationwide operation.
[00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:40.164]  They also tweeted out that these reports do nothing more than create mass panic and put communities and law enforcement personnel in unnecessary danger.
[00:07:40.284 --> 00:07:43.765]  And that is absolutely the truth, because that's what they did.
[00:07:43.785 --> 00:07:45.125]  They created mass panic.
[00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:50.427]  You saw these people protesting, thinking their grandma's going to get deported, rounded up.
[00:07:51.047 --> 00:07:53.227]  And yes, there's always that possibility.
[00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:57.929]  But as Trump has said again and again, they're focusing on the criminals, which I'm
[00:07:58.809 --> 00:08:23.775]  I am upset with her living in Austin, Texas because we actually have a sheriff who is so political right now and trying to get Austin turned into a sanctuary city and saying she's going to be defying the federal laws that she is having the media purposefully call people who are here illegally and arrested or possibly committed murder, raped a woman at knife point in front of her child.
[00:08:24.335 --> 00:08:44.867]  They just call him an Austin man because they don't want to stir up controversy They don't want people to understand that their issue is the people who are here illegally committing crimes Those are the ones that have got to go and so you're not really gonna hear about that You're just gonna stoke this fear and they're gonna show you pictures of people's grandmas and moms and things like that but this is this is what
[00:08:45.487 --> 00:08:46.328]  We're good to go.
[00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:15.555]  And now there's also a story going around this two-stroke fear and panic that Donald Trump is planning on deploying the National Guard to round up illegal immigrants.
[00:09:16.315 --> 00:09:26.419]  So this is about an 11-page document that the Associated Press pushed out actually and once again the White House has had to issue
[00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:30.582]  Um, an objection to that saying this is absolutely false.
[00:09:31.022 --> 00:09:33.004]  It's not a White House document.
[00:09:33.144 --> 00:09:39.629]  They say maybe it could have come from the DHS or something, but it was nothing that was ever presented to the president.
[00:09:39.729 --> 00:09:41.710]  It was nothing that they were ever discussing.
[00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:55.661]  This proposal would mobilize as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up illegal immigrants in 11 immigrant heavy states and it would give governors there the opportunity to opt out.
[00:09:56.727 --> 00:10:06.341]  Now the White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary said the White House has no plans in any capacity to use the National Guard to round up the people.
[00:10:07.202 --> 00:10:09.766]  Sean Spicer said this is 100% not true.
[00:10:09.866 --> 00:10:10.427]  It is false.
[00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:12.490]  It is irresponsible to be saying this.
[00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:20.532]  And there's no effort at all to round up illegal immigrants by utilizing the National Guard.
[00:10:21.073 --> 00:10:28.254]  So again, we're just seeing this mass panic being put out there by these news agencies who aren't even fact checking these sources.
[00:10:28.654 --> 00:10:42.517]  I mean, it would be very easy to check with the White House and say, is this real before you just put out this document that is going to stoke mass panic and basically tell people that the military is going to be in their streets rounding up their abuelita.
[00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:50.825]  So what they've gone on to say again is that this is just more fake news being put out by the AP.
[00:10:50.845 --> 00:10:54.068]  It was never seriously considered by the department.
[00:10:54.929 --> 00:10:58.772]  And again, they could have easily checked with the White House before putting this out.
[00:10:59.193 --> 00:10:59.693]  But if Donald
[00:10:59.753 --> 00:11:00.474]  Well, Trump did do it.
[00:11:00.654 --> 00:11:01.094]  Guess what?
[00:11:01.275 --> 00:11:07.321]  He would not be the first president to mobilize the National Guard for immigration enforcement.
[00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:19.714]  In 2010, former President Barack Obama said he would deploy 1,200 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, and they were sent to Arizona, Texas, California, and New Mexico.
[00:11:20.174 --> 00:11:25.680]  Now, the National Guard troops weren't authorized to arrest people found to be crossing the border illegally.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.545]  They helped staff observation posts, monitor surveillance footage and build fences.
[00:11:30.585 --> 00:11:38.954]  So this is the difference because with this document that's floating around about the alleged 100,000 National Guard troops, they would actually have the ability to
[00:11:40.075 --> 00:11:40.576]  I think so.
[00:11:58.712 --> 00:12:07.736]  But in 2006, former President George W. Bush called up 6,000 National Guard troops to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.
[00:12:08.136 --> 00:12:11.697]  They also were commissioned to help the Border Patrol.
[00:12:12.138 --> 00:12:19.241]  Now, according to Customs and Border Protection, that operation resulted in the apprehension of 5,003 people, 110 vehicles, 11 million pounds of marijuana, and about 1.4
[00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.992]  I'm sorry, 1,447 pounds of cocaine.
[00:12:29.813 --> 00:12:32.554]  And Obama removed more people from the U.S.
[00:12:32.594 --> 00:12:36.456]  than any other president at some 2.5 million.
[00:12:36.496 --> 00:12:38.317]  Bush deported 2 million people.
[00:12:39.038 --> 00:12:42.820]  And I mean, deportations jumped in the hundreds of thousands in the 90s.
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.521]  So this has been going on for quite some time.
[00:12:45.841 --> 00:12:49.924]  But it's just President Trump, who's this racist, sexist, xenophobe
[00:12:51.378 --> 00:12:57.161]  It's just absolute madness to watch this happening with our own eyes on real television.
[00:12:57.401 --> 00:13:01.702]  Well, I guess it's the very fake news that is really pushing this agenda.
[00:13:01.722 --> 00:13:05.184]  When you can see from the history, this is what presidents have done.
[00:13:05.424 --> 00:13:07.685]  They're supposed to enforce our immigration laws.
[00:13:08.345 --> 00:13:19.710]  And now, according to analysis by the Center for Immigration Studies, that wall that Donald Trump proposes to build would only need to stop 9 to 12 percent of illegal crossings to pay for itself.
[00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:29.335]  So the estimated $12 to $15 billion cost of the wall would be quickly offset by the savings to the government if fewer illegal immigrants arrive in the country over the next decade.
[00:13:30.496 --> 00:13:41.463]  The estimates from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine say the average cost to taxpayers of illegal immigrants is about $75,000 per illegal immigrant in a lifetime.
[00:13:41.863 --> 00:13:47.947]  If you take into consideration what taxpayers have to do if they're paying for these illegal immigrants' children,
[00:13:48.487 --> 00:13:52.229]  That amounts to about $95,000 per illegal immigrant.
[00:13:52.889 --> 00:13:59.933]  So this wall could save taxpayers nearly $64 billion over the next decade if half the crossings are stopped.
[00:13:59.953 --> 00:14:04.315]  That's more than three times the proposed cost of this wall.
[00:14:09.346 --> 00:14:16.171]  The theme of 2016 has been the triumph of individual will coming together for destiny.
[00:14:16.491 --> 00:14:22.415]  On our side, on the enemy's side, it has been one of abject delusion and arrogance.
[00:14:23.547 --> 00:14:27.690]  Now having said all this, why aren't I 50 points ahead, you might ask?
[00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:32.053]  This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for.
[00:14:32.073 --> 00:14:40.278]  And I'm sorry that we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.
[00:14:40.598 --> 00:14:46.743]  The enemy's confidence is one of its greatest weaknesses, and they're about to learn that in spades.
[00:14:47.123 --> 00:14:50.746]  People always say, oh, Wall Street's pure evil on the left, on the right.
[00:14:50.786 --> 00:14:51.907]  No, Wall Street can do no wrong.
[00:14:52.148 --> 00:14:52.588]  No.
[00:14:53.028 --> 00:15:05.659]  Big megabanks and big brokerage firms that are above the law, pushing gun control, pushing globalism, pushing transferring our sovereignty into international bodies, they control, is conquest, is crony capitalism, is wrong.
[00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:12.842]  But most of Wall Street is middle and small-time firms, and even some big ones that are family-owned, controlled that do want prosperity.
[00:15:12.942 --> 00:15:15.282]  And they're doubling down on Trump.
[00:15:15.423 --> 00:15:16.643]  They want the prosperity.
[00:15:16.903 --> 00:15:17.743]  They want the boom.
[00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:18.984]  They want the tax cuts.
[00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:23.686]  And the word is, Trump's going to freeze spending in the first year just to stabilize things.
[00:15:23.766 --> 00:15:26.547]  And he is intending, by year four, to begin cutting.
[00:15:26.807 --> 00:15:28.888]  And by the way, what he wants to do, he's going to try.
[00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:29.828]  This isn't talk.
[00:15:30.228 --> 00:15:35.790]  You're going to see, if he gets his way and we get behind him, cutting spending while revenue swells.
[00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:42.432]  And of course, Krugman is flipping out today, saying, this is an administration of white nationalists.
[00:15:42.833 --> 00:15:46.074]  Guess what he said in the New York Times in 1998.
[00:15:46.114 --> 00:15:46.474]  You cannot
[00:15:49.375 --> 00:15:50.035]  Make this up.
[00:15:50.055 --> 00:15:56.678]  This is when Dinosaur Media was telling itself, don't worry, in an article about the Internet, we're still going to be dominant.
[00:15:56.698 --> 00:16:00.639]  Remember back in the late 90s, the media was discussing would they be made obsolete, which has now happened?
[00:16:01.339 --> 00:16:02.440]  This is Ed Paul Krugman.
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:12.924]  The growth of the Internet will slow drastically as the flaw in the law, McCaffey's law, which states that the number of potential connections in a network
[00:16:13.564 --> 00:16:15.866]  Now, he made that sound real scientific and real smart, like an economist would.
[00:16:34.059 --> 00:16:35.280]  Who's giving you a false system.
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.301]  But has the Internet gotten bigger or smaller?
[00:16:37.642 --> 00:16:42.565]  It's gotten tens of thousands of times, logarithmically, exponentially bigger.
[00:16:43.165 --> 00:16:50.991]  And they say it's only going to get bigger as it ties into the Internet of Things, exponentially as well, by the very architecture of how the Internet was built.
[00:16:52.287 --> 00:16:58.590]  And by the early 1990s, all the big tech giants had already envisioned the current system we're under.
[00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:07.595]  But Krugman writes a piece of trash a couple times a week, sits around getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, and thinks he's a rocket scientist.
[00:17:07.955 --> 00:17:15.659]  We don't need make-work projects and infrastructure because it looks like he's hiring people that are going to privatize.
[00:17:15.999 --> 00:17:17.340]  That's what you've been doing, chump.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.901]  Giving the contracts to private companies is how we're going to get the jobs going.
[00:17:22.361 --> 00:17:26.083]  Not just shipping it overseas or paying off debts that don't exist.
[00:17:26.123 --> 00:17:30.924]  You know, all these monolithic fiat derivatives debts that should just be triaged.
[00:17:31.264 --> 00:17:31.624]  U.S.
[00:17:31.724 --> 00:17:42.208]  economic confidence surges to the highest level that Gallup, in a hundred plus years, has ever recorded.
[00:17:43.786 --> 00:17:45.528]  And they're already announcing they're going to raise interest rates.
[00:17:45.548 --> 00:17:46.428]  They've already done it once.
[00:17:46.869 --> 00:17:47.870]  They're trying to stall this.
[00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:52.494]  But now, that it's not just global, it's going to give themselves all the 0% money.
[00:17:52.514 --> 00:17:54.235]  It's time for the people to get some of that.
[00:17:54.435 --> 00:17:55.697]  And Trump wants to keep it low.
[00:17:55.717 --> 00:17:56.537]  Uh-uh-uh.
[00:17:56.577 --> 00:17:58.799]  They say, oh, the economy's overheating.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.362]  Trump's been president-elect for 40 days.
[00:18:02.022 --> 00:18:04.825]  He'll be in at 29, and we can't allow an overheating.
[00:18:05.365 --> 00:18:08.326]  So we're just gonna have to raise it maybe two or three more times before he gets in.
[00:18:08.866 --> 00:18:10.787]  Hoping it ends this Trump run.
[00:18:11.327 --> 00:18:14.748]  Crony capitalism is not letting us compete so we can be controlled.
[00:18:15.369 --> 00:18:16.129]  It's ending.
[00:18:16.589 --> 00:18:17.589]  That's why they're so mad.
[00:18:17.629 --> 00:18:22.751]  The globalists have been selling off this country and talking about what geniuses they are for decades.
[00:18:23.471 --> 00:18:31.614]  No, what you are is a bunch of backstabbing traitors that sold out the country that had over half the world's wealth till you got control of it.
[00:18:32.175 --> 00:18:33.235]  Oh yeah, comprende that.
[00:18:43.769 --> 00:18:50.472]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:18:50.732 --> 00:18:52.873]  You better believe you got one!
[00:19:01.397 --> 00:19:05.819]  This has been adopted as of 2017 by the Department of Defense.
[00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:07.800]  All four branches of the military.
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.321]  Combat One.
[00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:20.560]  And guess who in the spring of 2017 has the exclusive right to sell this to everybody else but the military?
[00:19:21.454 --> 00:19:22.994]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:23.614 --> 00:19:27.195]  I want to commend Q and Patrick and the rest of our team.
[00:19:27.235 --> 00:19:30.496]  I want to commend Combat One for getting the big Pentagon deal.
[00:19:31.096 --> 00:19:33.857]  And I want to thank them for supporting us because they know we support America.
[00:19:34.177 --> 00:19:47.719]  We are the exclusive source of Combat One Skin and Muscle Optimization Field Foam, Field Spray Skin and Muscle Optimization, and Broad Spectrum Hygiene Tactical Bath.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.980]  Contains eight pre-moistened cloths.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:56.324]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are incredibly affordable and they have patented proprietary systems.
[00:19:56.925 --> 00:20:01.988]  That's why it's been adopted by the Pentagon, by the Defense Department, system-wide.
[00:20:02.048 --> 00:20:08.954]  I'm going to go over some of the numbers, some of the proven statistics and the claims that Combat One can make right now.
[00:20:09.754 --> 00:20:18.803]  Never before has the public been able to access this new Combat One military-grade hygiene technology used by special operations to maintain hygiene during survival situations.
[00:20:19.183 --> 00:20:21.265]  Studied for safety and effectiveness by St.
[00:20:21.325 --> 00:20:23.387]  John's Medical Research Institute, St.
[00:20:23.447 --> 00:20:31.195]  Jude's, and the American Journal of Infection Control, the technology behind Combat One wipes kills bad bacteria while leaving beneficial
[00:20:31.915 --> 00:20:33.396]  Skin bacteria unharmed.
[00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:34.557]  That's the key buffer.
[00:20:34.777 --> 00:20:39.500]  The toxic wipes, the sanitizers kill everything, including your immune system.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.460]  They lower your fertility.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.021]  It's all admitted.
[00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:44.883]  Combat One is able to do this naturally by only targeting the bad stuff.
[00:20:45.363 --> 00:20:46.264]  And again, it's all patented.
[00:20:46.304 --> 00:20:47.064]  It's super secret.
[00:20:47.424 --> 00:20:49.326]  Twelve years, Special Forces testing it.
[00:20:49.966 --> 00:20:55.352]  This is something every M4 Warrior needs to order, needs to have in their home, needs to use in their daily lives.
[00:20:55.652 --> 00:21:01.078]  Whether it's cleaning your guns, or your own skin, or when you're out camping, this is the game changer.
[00:21:01.098 --> 00:21:06.224]  The entire family of Combat One is available exclusively at m4warriorstore.com.
[00:21:07.202 --> 00:21:10.545]  Just coming back from the river where I was using one of our water filtration straws.
[00:21:11.105 --> 00:21:13.427]  A certain device we sell here at Infantwarestore.com.
[00:21:14.188 --> 00:21:18.591]  And I had smacked my knuckle pretty hard the other day with my knife after cleaning one of the animals.
[00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:21.673]  So I'm going to use some Combat One Foam.
[00:21:22.034 --> 00:21:23.335]  Show you guys that we actually use it.
[00:21:23.775 --> 00:21:24.536]  How well it works.
[00:21:25.556 --> 00:21:27.698]  This wound has been open for about five days now.
[00:21:28.459 --> 00:21:30.000]  I just dipped it in and out of the river.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.362]  So just to better, safe than sorry.
[00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:45.189]  Once I let that soak in, I'll wrap it up, field dress, and nice and clean again.
[00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.775]  And it certainly is coming to the rescue with Combat One.
[00:21:49.135 --> 00:21:50.257]  Born in America.
[00:21:50.718 --> 00:21:51.619]  Made in America.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.466]  And now distributed by InfoWars to America.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.401]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:53.535]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.836 --> 00:23:00.767]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.493]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:23:07.714 --> 00:23:13.340]  I'm Millie Weaver, and we're going to be breaking down the most epic Donald Trump tweets of the week.
[00:23:13.601 --> 00:23:18.727]  Well, Donald Trump has been on fire on Twitter this week, putting the haters to rest.
[00:23:19.067 --> 00:23:22.371]  So let's go ahead and look at some of his most epic tweets of the week.
[00:23:23.257 --> 00:23:28.040]  The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.282]  Gang members, drug dealers, and others are being removed.
[00:23:32.742 --> 00:23:36.724]  Well, Donald Trump is stopping out those fake news lies.
[00:23:37.085 --> 00:23:43.408]  You know how the fake news likes to make up that Donald Trump is going to deport all these innocent Mexican Americans?
[00:23:43.908 --> 00:23:46.010]  That's not even the case, okay?
[00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:51.252]  He's only going to be going after those who are here illegally and that are committing crimes.
[00:23:51.293 --> 00:23:51.833]  We're talking
[00:23:52.273 --> 00:23:54.995]  You know, gang members, members of the cartel.
[00:23:55.316 --> 00:23:59.059]  So he is putting that fake news lie to rest.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.080]  Well, I don't know.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.722]  Maybe he was watching CNN fake news.
[00:24:03.762 --> 00:24:04.223]  What do you think?
[00:24:06.144 --> 00:24:06.585]  You don't buy it.
[00:24:06.605 --> 00:24:07.806]  It was a joke.
[00:24:07.886 --> 00:24:08.546]  I know it was a joke.
[00:24:08.586 --> 00:24:11.128]  I'm saying you don't buy what he said, obviously.
[00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:13.651]  Erin?
[00:24:14.311 --> 00:24:14.531]  Yes.
[00:24:16.813 --> 00:24:18.474]  Kevin, I'm not... Are we on?
[00:24:19.771 --> 00:24:23.353]  It looks like we've lost connection with Senator Sanders.
[00:24:24.314 --> 00:24:33.018]  While on fake news CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network.
[00:24:33.478 --> 00:24:35.720]  They said technical difficulties.
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.221]  Yeah, freaking right.
[00:24:39.702 --> 00:24:41.943]  We are supposed to believe that baloney.
[00:24:42.543 --> 00:24:55.568]  You know, every time it seems like these CNN reporters have some guests on, when the guest says something that they don't like or that doesn't go along with their script, they just say, oh, technical difficulties.
[00:24:55.868 --> 00:24:56.628]  We lost him.
[00:24:56.788 --> 00:24:57.829]  Oh, that's too bad.
[00:24:57.869 --> 00:24:59.289]  We're just going to have to move on.
[00:24:59.649 --> 00:25:01.970]  Well, we're not buying it, CNN.
[00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:05.832]  And that's why Donald Trump has called you guys out for being fake news.
[00:25:06.032 --> 00:25:08.193]  Actually, very fake news.
[00:25:09.353 --> 00:25:10.914]  I know Mark Cuban well.
[00:25:11.354 --> 00:25:16.678]  He backed me big time, but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls.
[00:25:17.218 --> 00:25:19.940]  He's not smart enough to run for president.
[00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:25.443]  I'm sorry, but seriously, this is awesome.
[00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:31.828]  Trump just totally destroyed Mark Cuban, and Mark had it coming because Mark tweeted out this.
[00:25:33.098 --> 00:25:36.160]  It's time we accept at POTUS for who he is.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.581]  He's entertaining.
[00:25:38.041 --> 00:25:39.222]  He's oblivious.
[00:25:39.602 --> 00:25:41.924]  He isn't smart enough to be dangerous.
[00:25:42.444 --> 00:25:48.368]  He also tweeted, it's a waste of time to try and turn Pinocchio into a real president.
[00:25:48.808 --> 00:25:53.231]  The focus needs to be on the Geppettos and legislators around him.
[00:25:53.951 --> 00:25:56.032]  Well, Mark, you really got served.
[00:25:56.132 --> 00:26:02.334]  I mean, you talked all this trash and then, what do you know, Trump came around and completely fired you.
[00:26:03.274 --> 00:26:05.735]  Mark, Pinocchio, really?
[00:26:06.075 --> 00:26:09.096]  You really think that we're going to believe that Trump is a Pinocchio?
[00:26:09.116 --> 00:26:19.040]  If you want to talk about puppets, let's talk about Hillary Clinton, who you supported, the biggest puppet of all, with her Geppetto, you know, her big old
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.002]  Fat Geppetto George Soros, the old crotchety man.
[00:26:23.442 --> 00:26:26.604]  Give me a break, Mark, and you got served.
[00:26:27.845 --> 00:26:34.349]  The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election and so badly.
[00:26:34.369 --> 00:26:34.349]  306.
[00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:38.151]  So they made up a story.
[00:26:38.672 --> 00:26:39.152]  Russia.
[00:26:39.572 --> 00:26:40.793]  Fake news.
[00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:42.894]  Russia is fake news.
[00:26:43.074 --> 00:26:43.375]  Russia.
[00:26:43.435 --> 00:26:45.656]  This is fake news put out by the media.
[00:26:46.556 --> 00:26:48.698]  I can handle a bad story better than anybody.
[00:26:49.662 --> 00:26:50.743]  As long as it's true.
[00:26:50.943 --> 00:26:55.869]  And, you know, over a course of time I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm okay with that.
[00:26:56.189 --> 00:26:59.313]  But I'm not okay when it is fake.
[00:27:00.054 --> 00:27:06.317]  Man oh man, when are you fake news people gonna knock it off with the Russia baloney?
[00:27:06.697 --> 00:27:08.577]  You really think we're gonna believe it?
[00:27:08.698 --> 00:27:12.179]  I mean, give me a break, there's just no basis in reality.
[00:27:12.679 --> 00:27:17.361]  Oh yeah, we're all Russian reporters working for Vladimir Putin, yeah!
[00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:19.422]  You know, we drink the whiskey, yeah!
[00:27:19.842 --> 00:27:23.584]  Give me a break, you think we're actually gonna believe that baloney?
[00:27:23.644 --> 00:27:25.124]  That's so ridiculous.
[00:27:25.204 --> 00:27:26.585]  Let's move on to the next tweet.
[00:27:27.458 --> 00:27:31.200]  Thank you for all of the nice statements on the press conference yesterday.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:36.363]  Rush Limbaugh said one of the greatest ever, fake media not happy.
[00:27:36.383 --> 00:27:38.624]  I mean, I watch CNN.
[00:27:38.664 --> 00:27:41.105]  It's so much anger and hatred.
[00:27:41.706 --> 00:27:44.027]  It's so important to the public to get an honest press.
[00:27:44.107 --> 00:27:46.869]  The press, the public doesn't believe you people anymore.
[00:27:47.449 --> 00:27:49.150]  As an example, your CNN.
[00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:54.052]  I mean, it's story after story after story is bad.
[00:27:54.753 --> 00:27:55.273]  I won.
[00:27:56.034 --> 00:27:56.294]  I won.
[00:27:57.324 --> 00:27:58.044]  That is right.
[00:27:58.084 --> 00:28:00.425]  The fake news was super mad.
[00:28:00.485 --> 00:28:02.106]  I mean, they were not happy.
[00:28:02.186 --> 00:28:03.707]  And Rush Limbaugh put it greatly.
[00:28:03.767 --> 00:28:05.868]  He said that Trump took them to school.
[00:28:06.208 --> 00:28:08.329]  And I wholeheartedly agree with that.
[00:28:08.689 --> 00:28:12.711]  I mean, they just kept asking him the exact same question over and over.
[00:28:13.031 --> 00:28:14.272]  Are you related with Russia?
[00:28:14.292 --> 00:28:15.632]  Do you have ties to Russia?
[00:28:15.652 --> 00:28:16.733]  Do you have interests with Russia?
[00:28:16.773 --> 00:28:18.454]  He's like, no, no, no.
[00:28:18.574 --> 00:28:20.995]  Gosh, stop asking the same questions.
[00:28:21.055 --> 00:28:22.976]  Who writes these questions for you guys?
[00:28:23.556 --> 00:28:31.923]  So he made a great point and the most epic part about that conference was when he demoted them from fake news to very fake news.
[00:28:32.443 --> 00:28:35.806]  Well, this concludes our Trump Tweets of the Week.
[00:28:36.106 --> 00:28:40.890]  Check back in next week for another episode of epic Donald Trump Tweets of the Week.
[00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.933]  I'm Millie Weaver and you're watching the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:28:54.053 --> 00:28:55.955]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing
[00:29:08.342 --> 00:29:15.630]  What we have going on in the South China Seas is just more power-grabbing attempts from the Chinese government.
[00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:19.575]  Let's go over the most recent developments in this case.
[00:29:19.995 --> 00:29:21.717]  China malls maritime law revisions.
[00:29:22.178 --> 00:29:26.583]  China is considering an update to its 1984 maritime traffic safety law.
[00:29:26.843 --> 00:29:36.774]  The Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council announced earlier this week that it would consider revisions to restrict the navigation of foreign vessels in Chinese territorial waters.
[00:29:37.095 --> 00:29:42.981]  A draft of the law notes that foreign ships that enter Chinese waters without approval will be fined as much as
[00:29:45.024 --> 00:29:49.688]  $72,000 American and those violating Chinese laws would be expelled.
[00:29:49.708 --> 00:29:51.710]  This is a story from Reuters.
[00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:55.734]  China considering making foreign submersible travel on surface.
[00:29:55.994 --> 00:29:56.775]  These are submarines.
[00:29:57.035 --> 00:30:03.741]  Foreign submersibles travel on the surface and report their movements to authorities when in China's waters.
[00:30:03.781 --> 00:30:05.923]  That's what this new law would
[00:30:06.644 --> 00:30:10.986]  Designate a Chinese naval vessel took a US underwater drone in the China Sea.
[00:30:11.006 --> 00:30:34.016]  Let's recall that that was a major story but now the People's Republic of China saying any foreign submersible has to be Cleared by the Chinese government and this is to restore safety and order No, really, it's just a total power grab and they want to lay claim to the resource-rich South China Sea
[00:30:35.618 --> 00:30:49.685]  Jiao Peng, a maritime border expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said a sovereign state, and the biggest coastal state in the South China Sea, is entitled to adjust its maritime laws as needed, which will promote peace and stable development.
[00:30:50.045 --> 00:30:52.887]  Well, that's what they're saying for these changes that are set to come in 2020.
[00:30:52.927 --> 00:30:53.927]  But let's look at this.
[00:30:55.788 --> 00:30:56.708]  Very important here.
[00:30:57.128 --> 00:30:59.589]  Tribunal has already covered this.
[00:30:59.649 --> 00:31:03.711]  A tribunal has already rejected what China is trying to do in the South China Sea.
[00:31:03.751 --> 00:31:08.872]  An international tribunal in The Hague delivered a sweeping rebuke of China's behavior in the South China Sea.
[00:31:09.173 --> 00:31:17.695]  Again, this was a almost a year ago, including the construction of islands and found its expansive claim to sovereign waters had no legal basis.
[00:31:17.715 --> 00:31:22.297]  This was a landmark case brought up by the Philippines, and it forced China to
[00:31:22.777 --> 00:31:25.618]  Well John Podesta doesn't know when to shut his mouth, does he?
[00:31:25.658 --> 00:31:27.158]  Now he's coming out against Trump.
[00:31:49.844 --> 00:31:53.765]  Podesta, Trump wouldn't know the truth if it slapped him in the face.
[00:31:53.805 --> 00:31:59.867]  Of course, Podesta became a topic of conversation at the Trump press conference yesterday.
[00:32:00.347 --> 00:32:07.169]  And so Podesta took to Twitter, responding to Trump, saying that the president wouldn't know the truth if it slapped him in the face.
[00:32:07.469 --> 00:32:16.852]  But then Podesta went one further and said, for the record, I've never said bad things about Hillary in the emails the Russians stole to help elect him POTUS.
[00:32:17.272 --> 00:32:18.172]  So here he is,
[00:32:19.861 --> 00:32:25.163]  Scolding Donald Trump for lying, and then he lies in the very next tweet!
[00:32:26.084 --> 00:32:27.764]  The Russians stole the emails?
[00:32:28.485 --> 00:32:41.830]  No, your emails got phished from you because you didn't have proper security, Podesta, and you might want to stay out of the limelight or try to clear your name from the things being alleged about you on social media.
[00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:46.432]  But hey, I doubt you're going to take advice from a deplorable like me.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:03.649 --> 00:37:09.470]  Well, all across the nation, universities are fighting to become sanctuary campuses.
[00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:18.572]  Of course, this is part of the virtue-signaling social justice warrior movement to try to impede anything Trump does, most of it based off fake news.
[00:37:18.972 --> 00:37:20.872]  One of those universities is Baylor University.
[00:37:20.932 --> 00:37:27.634]  I'm now joined by a student at Baylor University, Sam Walker, who's also part of the College Republicans at Baylor.
[00:37:28.074 --> 00:37:29.374]  Sam, thanks so much for joining us.
[00:37:29.814 --> 00:37:37.426]  Tell me, what has been the response through your perspective to the proposed petition to make Baylor a sanctuary campus?
[00:37:38.669 --> 00:37:40.270]  Well, Owen, thanks for having me, number one.
[00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:47.734]  After the petition was started about two weeks ago, there's been numerous people that have just been signing it without even looking at it.
[00:37:47.774 --> 00:37:55.898]  They hear Sanctuary Campus and they're like, oh, that's great, we can help illegals and refugees and it'll be a good time, but they don't look at what's actually on it.
[00:37:56.398 --> 00:38:00.160]  When you actually read the petition, there are several things that are listed on there that are
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:01.201]  Well it's
[00:38:15.717 --> 00:38:15.937]  There's a
[00:38:35.706 --> 00:38:42.701]  They don't even realize that if this petition was to pass and you were to become, Baylor, to become a sanctuary campus, they're going to lose funding.
[00:38:42.721 --> 00:38:43.963]  They're going to break the law.
[00:38:44.324 --> 00:38:46.729]  Is anybody even bringing this awareness to the table for them?
[00:38:47.574 --> 00:38:54.018]  That's what the College Republicans, the Young Conservatives for Texas, and the Young Americans for Liberty.
[00:38:54.058 --> 00:38:54.979]  We've all joined together.
[00:38:54.999 --> 00:39:03.004]  We're several conservative clubs on campus and we're working together to distribute flyers and information and just get the word out that like, hey, this isn't what Baylor needs right now.
[00:39:03.044 --> 00:39:05.126]  This isn't, you know, it's illegal.
[00:39:05.446 --> 00:39:07.647]  So we're just doing what we can to get that information.
[00:39:07.808 --> 00:39:11.130]  Once people hear about it, they're much less receptive to the petition.
[00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:18.898]  And just to be clear, what we're talking about here, as far as the legal status is concerned, Greg Abbott is fighting sanctuary statuses.
[00:39:19.219 --> 00:39:26.347]  He's already doing it via the legal system with sanctuary cities, talking about cutting funds to sanctuary cities, but
[00:39:26.727 --> 00:39:34.054]  He has gone even farther to mention that any campus that wants to be called a sanctuary campus, he's going to defund.
[00:39:34.074 --> 00:39:38.478]  That's the Texas governor and the bill is Senate Bill No.
[00:39:38.498 --> 00:39:39.439]  4 that talks about this.
[00:39:39.719 --> 00:39:47.466]  From your understanding, I know you've looked into this, you're trying to raise awareness of this, what are the parameters if you guys were to be considered a sanctuary campus?
[00:39:47.766 --> 00:39:50.488]  What is the immediate parameters that you're looking at legally?
[00:39:52.436 --> 00:40:00.438]  Well, as far as losing funding, we received $1.14 billion in 2016 from endowments from the government.
[00:40:01.998 --> 00:40:07.820]  So that's the first thing that would go, would be our funding, and that would make school much more expensive than it already is here.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:17.182]  As far as the legal parameters, I've done research on it, but the funding is the main thing that we're worried about.
[00:40:17.714 --> 00:40:19.276]  And of course they cut that funding.
[00:40:19.376 --> 00:40:22.058]  Who knows how that's going to impact the students?
[00:40:22.118 --> 00:40:24.000]  What kind of clubs are going to have to get shut down?
[00:40:24.541 --> 00:40:28.584]  Professors maybe losing their jobs or certain cuts that are going to have to go on with that.
[00:40:29.145 --> 00:40:31.467]  And of course there's a side issue here as well.
[00:40:32.028 --> 00:40:33.849]  You guys are already dealing with some stuff.
[00:40:33.889 --> 00:40:38.654]  You guys are under investigation, under tight scrutiny because of what happened with the Baylor football program.
[00:40:39.094 --> 00:40:40.235]  Are the students aware that
[00:40:41.036 --> 00:40:47.102]  You already got that going on, you're already being watched, and now you're talking about maybe breaking the law, becoming a sanctuary campus?
[00:40:47.402 --> 00:40:48.744]  Is this something people are talking about?
[00:40:49.417 --> 00:40:54.920]  Yes, that's another thing that we brought up on the flyers that me and Garrett Redfern put together and we started distributing those.
[00:40:56.561 --> 00:41:01.104]  We're under warning from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.
[00:41:02.525 --> 00:41:05.486]  We're under warning to get our accreditation stripped from us because of that.
[00:41:05.746 --> 00:41:11.770]  And so we think just adding on more stuff for them to look at for us, that's not going to help at all.
[00:41:13.174 --> 00:41:18.001]  Now, let's say that you're just walking around campus, you're going around going to class or whatever.
[00:41:18.461 --> 00:41:24.129]  How many students would you say are even aware of this, aware of the petition, care at all?
[00:41:24.509 --> 00:41:25.891]  Is it a high number, low number?
[00:41:25.931 --> 00:41:26.772]  What are you seeing?
[00:41:27.939 --> 00:41:32.121]  Um, at first we thought that it was just an insurmountable number of people that were in favor of this.
[00:41:32.221 --> 00:41:36.123]  We looked at the petition, there's almost 2,000 signatures the last time I checked.
[00:41:37.584 --> 00:41:41.346]  But whenever I went out and actually started handing out flyers, people were asking like, what is this?
[00:41:41.766 --> 00:41:43.127]  Like, I haven't even heard of this yet.
[00:41:43.507 --> 00:41:50.533]  But then on the other hand, there have been professors in different classes that are pushing for the petition to get signed.
[00:41:50.553 --> 00:42:00.482]  They're asking their students to sign it, which I don't have exact evidence of that, but it's against university policy here to push petitions like this.
[00:42:01.723 --> 00:42:02.783]  There's a good number of people.
[00:42:03.344 --> 00:42:08.408]  We have 16,000 undergraduate students here, and 2,000 students have signed it.
[00:42:09.878 --> 00:42:20.243]  It's growing in popularity, but I think our main thing here is getting the facts to the people that have already signed it and the ones that are thinking about signing it so that they learn and understand what they're going to do.
[00:42:20.703 --> 00:42:30.487]  Yes, and again, this was a petition that was started by the Postgraduate Religious Studies Department to make Baylor a sanctuary campus.
[00:42:30.507 --> 00:42:35.569]  Now, you just mentioned potentially professors trying to plug this in their class.
[00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:38.631]  Have you experienced that, or are you just hearing that that might be going on?
[00:42:39.224 --> 00:42:40.245]  I have not experienced it.
[00:42:40.265 --> 00:42:42.706]  I've just heard other people talk about that going on.
[00:42:43.226 --> 00:42:43.487]  Okay.
[00:42:43.507 --> 00:42:47.189]  So we don't have any hard evidence of it, so we can't bring it toward the university.
[00:42:47.229 --> 00:42:48.169]  It's just rumors I've heard.
[00:42:48.490 --> 00:42:55.994]  So you haven't seen any, you know, the school actually pushing for this via professors or administration or anything like that.
[00:42:56.374 --> 00:43:03.599]  You're just seeing it with the students, and obviously started with the postgraduate religious department, but then it's worked its way down to the undergraduates is what you're saying.
[00:43:04.301 --> 00:43:04.481]  Yes.
[00:43:05.022 --> 00:43:05.922]  That's what they started.
[00:43:05.962 --> 00:43:11.286]  They signed the petition, they created the petition, and then they were handing out flyers for undergraduate students to sign.
[00:43:11.747 --> 00:43:13.007]  Okay, and I'm glad you mentioned that.
[00:43:13.128 --> 00:43:14.368]  So, they're handing out flyers.
[00:43:14.609 --> 00:43:15.629]  What about protests?
[00:43:15.669 --> 00:43:17.511]  Has there been any protests on campus?
[00:43:17.591 --> 00:43:19.232]  Are people being vocal about this?
[00:43:19.532 --> 00:43:22.014]  Or is it kind of just staying to the petition?
[00:43:22.835 --> 00:43:27.018]  It's mostly just staying to the petition and flyers that have been handed out.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.542]  Now, is there any pushback coming from other than just the clubs?
[00:43:32.642 --> 00:43:37.564]  Are there just regular students who may not be involved with any clubs, may not be too interested in politics?
[00:43:37.884 --> 00:43:40.506]  Has there been any pushback at the student level that you've seen?
[00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:47.349]  Whenever we were handing out the flyers, there were numerous students that, after reading it, were very angry.
[00:43:47.429 --> 00:43:56.153]  They didn't like what was happening, didn't like what was going on, and I feel like if we can organize these students in an effort, then we can really make some change in a positive way.
[00:43:56.809 --> 00:44:03.233]  So we've covered the possibility of being defunded if you became a sanctuary campus.
[00:44:03.553 --> 00:44:04.333]  You're a student there.
[00:44:04.734 --> 00:44:05.414]  You're a freshman.
[00:44:05.574 --> 00:44:07.996]  You've got, you know, you've got three years ahead of you.
[00:44:08.036 --> 00:44:09.917]  You would hope at Baylor eventually to be a graduate.
[00:44:09.937 --> 00:44:11.318]  Maybe you go on further with Baylor.
[00:44:11.338 --> 00:44:14.780]  But as a student, I mean, are you worried?
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.721]  Is this something that actually is worrying you?
[00:44:16.781 --> 00:44:25.206]  That if they become a sanctuary campus, if they actually take this seriously and declare sanctuary status, are you worried about the future of your university?
[00:44:26.004 --> 00:44:26.784]  You know, I really am.
[00:44:27.104 --> 00:44:34.627]  It's already a different university from when my sister went here in 2007 when she graduated, just from coming and visiting and hearing her talk about it.
[00:44:34.647 --> 00:44:41.269]  It's a drastically different university now, and I think that when we cut the funding from it, that's just going to damage us even further.
[00:44:43.089 --> 00:44:57.654]  We have problems with the accreditation, and losing the accreditation is going to, again, you know, make... If we lost our accreditation, my degree would be worthless, and I'm spending all this money to come here, and just to have a degree from an unaccredited university would be terrible.
[00:44:58.464 --> 00:45:01.806]  Wow, you know, that's actually an amazing point that you bring up right there.
[00:45:02.667 --> 00:45:10.612]  A lot of people might hear you say, hey, look, they're going to defund us if we become a sanctuary campus, and they'll kind of just let that go.
[00:45:10.672 --> 00:45:11.953]  They won't really let that sink in.
[00:45:12.273 --> 00:45:19.398]  But if you talk about the accredation, the, you know, having a degree and then it not being worth anything, that might be something that hits home.
[00:45:19.778 --> 00:45:27.603]  Are you guys planning on trying to really promote this, really get that truth out there so that people can hear this and maybe some of the momentum behind this petition can stop?
[00:45:27.664 --> 00:45:28.144]  Is that your plan?
[00:45:28.864 --> 00:45:29.625]  Yes, that's our plan.
[00:45:30.225 --> 00:45:33.488]  The three clubs that I mentioned earlier, we've organized together.
[00:45:33.548 --> 00:45:47.538]  The Young Conservatives of Texas is having a Freedom of Speech Ball next week, and that's whenever we plan to make our first big push with getting the information out there, because we'll be right in the middle of campus, lots of traffic going through there, and there'll be lots of opportunities to give information like that out.
[00:45:47.958 --> 00:45:49.159]  Well, I wish you guys the best.
[00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:51.901]  You should film some of that and maybe we might be able to cover that a little more.
[00:45:51.942 --> 00:45:57.666]  But you know, you mentioned somebody going there in 2007 saying how it's such a different campus now.
[00:45:58.527 --> 00:45:58.908]  I will just...
[00:46:00.031 --> 00:46:00.931]  I agree with you there.
[00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:05.452]  From my experience, you know, the University of Missouri-Columbia is a former Big 12 school.
[00:46:05.472 --> 00:46:07.333]  I'm sure that you're aware of the Tigers of Mizzou.
[00:46:07.973 --> 00:46:10.334]  And they had a social justice warrior movement.
[00:46:10.374 --> 00:46:11.474]  They started doing protests.
[00:46:11.834 --> 00:46:20.276]  And if you look at everything that's happened at that campus, it kind of illustrates to me what the ignorant liberals are doing to universities right now.
[00:46:20.316 --> 00:46:21.677]  And I hope that that doesn't happen to you.
[00:46:21.937 --> 00:46:25.578]  But are you seeing that, the liberalization of Baylor, kind of coming full circle?
[00:46:26.451 --> 00:46:27.051]  Yes, I am.
[00:46:27.712 --> 00:46:41.617]  Already last semester we had a chapel speaker that was in support of Black Lives Matter, and her whole speech during chapel was about Black Lives Matter and equating their movement to the Jews' exodus from Egypt.
[00:46:42.257 --> 00:46:47.359]  And it's just the liberalization as a whole between professors and everything.
[00:46:47.439 --> 00:46:54.142]  We're a Baptist Christian university, and I feel like our values don't match that anymore in the time that I'm coming here.
[00:46:54.784 --> 00:46:57.708]  Sam Walker, student at Baylor University, part of the College Republicans.
[00:46:58.008 --> 00:47:01.953]  Thanks so much for joining us and good luck keeping that sanctuary status away from your school.
[00:47:02.974 --> 00:47:07.739]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.415]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.435 --> 00:48:49.476]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.816 --> 00:48:50.497]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.557 --> 00:48:51.158]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.519 --> 00:48:59.069]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.089 --> 00:48:59.970]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.030]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.462 --> 00:49:12.905]  Like most technology, body cameras for the police is a two-edged sword.
[00:49:12.945 --> 00:49:15.086]  It can be a good thing, or it can be a bad thing.
[00:49:15.126 --> 00:49:15.947]  It can be misused.
[00:49:16.587 --> 00:49:26.573]  Now we're looking at new technology that is evolving from Taser, and of course these are the people that gave us those wonderful devices where the police can whip you into submission electronically.
[00:49:27.173 --> 00:49:29.475]  They're also very big in the body cam industry.
[00:49:30.115 --> 00:49:37.877]  And they're looking at bringing body cams that can do instant face recognition and can hook into facial databases.
[00:49:38.297 --> 00:49:53.420]  This is an article today from Vulcative and they say the police body cam industry is bringing us new powers and also new privacy concerns and this controversial technology that is bolstered by the need to hold police accountable after numerous high-profile killings of unarmed black citizens.
[00:49:54.261 --> 00:49:55.421]  Let's get over this idea.
[00:49:56.041 --> 00:49:57.982]  That it's just black lives that matter, okay?
[00:49:58.082 --> 00:50:06.408]  Let's understand, and black people need to understand this as well, unless you make this a concern of the entire community, you're not going to see this solved.
[00:50:06.788 --> 00:50:10.410]  We have to understand it's not just black people who are being killed by police unnecessarily.
[00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:14.993]  That is something that we have to look at as the entire community and hold them responsible.
[00:50:15.033 --> 00:50:16.894]  But let's move on to this actual technology.
[00:50:17.154 --> 00:50:20.997]  Taser says the newly formed division will develop AI-powered tech
[00:50:21.417 --> 00:50:32.081]  Specifically aimed at law enforcement using automation and machine learning algorithms to let cops search for people and for objects in video footage captured in the on-body camera systems.
[00:50:32.201 --> 00:50:35.122]  Okay, now let's hope that this is completely accurate.
[00:50:35.142 --> 00:50:44.966]  If they're going to look at you and determine that you've got a gun and you're dangerous or they take a look at your face and they misread that, identify you as a wanted criminal on the run or a terrorist,
[00:50:45.706 --> 00:50:46.967]  That could cost you your life.
[00:50:47.007 --> 00:50:50.529]  And of course, we've already seen this with some of this wonderful technology.
[00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:58.254]  Surveilling a parking lot, noticing a guy that is walking around a car, then stoops down and disappears from the car.
[00:50:58.314 --> 00:50:59.755]  They think, oh, they call the police.
[00:51:00.335 --> 00:51:02.616]  We have an auto theft in progress.
[00:51:02.656 --> 00:51:06.519]  They get there with guns drawn and it turns out the guy is just changing his tire.
[00:51:07.099 --> 00:51:08.561]  That is what false positives can do.
[00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:12.385]  But then they go on to talk about how they can tag you and classify you.
[00:51:12.405 --> 00:51:22.876]  They can use keywords to search through video footage, just like they'd look for news articles on Google, allowing them to quickly redact footage and zoom in on relevant elements.
[00:51:23.077 --> 00:51:24.558]  That is the issue, folks.
[00:51:25.379 --> 00:51:27.320]  To quickly redact footage.
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:30.261]  That's the problem with body cam footage.
[00:51:30.901 --> 00:51:33.982]  The fact that we don't always get the footage from the police.
[00:51:34.042 --> 00:51:39.624]  They inadvertently lost it, or erased it, or it disappeared from the locker room.
[00:51:40.025 --> 00:51:41.725]  That seems to happen when they're in the wrong.
[00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:44.526]  Now, when they're in the right, yeah, it's there to back them up.
[00:51:44.566 --> 00:51:48.288]  But when they do something wrong, they somehow seem to redact it.
[00:51:49.068 --> 00:51:52.871]  And technology that lets them do that more efficiently is even more concerning.
[00:51:52.891 --> 00:52:08.424]  And they say a Department of Justice study found that at least nine different body camera manufacturers currently support facial recognition in their products or have the ability to add it later and that fully half of American adults have their faces entered into a law enforcement database.
[00:52:09.124 --> 00:52:14.188]  Now if you think this is a problem, I don't think this is nearly as much of a problem
[00:52:15.043 --> 00:52:22.388]  That's what we're going to see happening with our automobiles when they join the Internet of Things and when our highways become spy ways.
[00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:31.795]  We now have, and they're very eager about this, this is from a trade publication talking about how the DOT is proposing a rule to mandate V2V technology.
[00:52:31.835 --> 00:52:34.957]  That means vehicle to vehicle, cars talking to each other.
[00:52:34.977 --> 00:52:43.383]  But of course they're not just going to be talking to each other, they're going to be talking to the entire infrastructure, to the roads, to the traffic lights, to the government.
[00:52:43.763 --> 00:52:47.446]  Telling it where you are, how fast you're driving, and other aspects of what you're doing.
[00:52:47.827 --> 00:52:52.230]  Talk about an instant ticket right there that they give you at that moment.
[00:52:52.591 --> 00:53:02.599]  When we look at where this is going to go, just think for a moment about this article we saw earlier this week about an Ohio village that was ordered to repay three million dollars.
[00:53:02.639 --> 00:53:04.501]  Now this is from the Daily Mail, so they call it a village.
[00:53:04.521 --> 00:53:05.462]  It's just a small town.
[00:53:06.242 --> 00:53:18.554]  And this is a county judge who told New Miami and Ohio that they had to return this money because they were told a couple of years ago, no, what you're doing is in violation of the Constitution in Ohio, so you're going to have to return that money.
[00:53:18.894 --> 00:53:21.396]  What they were getting was they were getting 45,000 tickets in just 15 months.
[00:53:21.416 --> 00:53:23.638]  That's 3,000 tickets a month on average.
[00:53:26.561 --> 00:53:27.061]  I don't think so.
[00:53:48.135 --> 00:53:49.796]  Spy way, instead of a highway.
[00:53:50.277 --> 00:53:53.659]  Now, the manufacturers are very excited about this.
[00:53:53.779 --> 00:53:59.204]  Of course, this is going to be new black boxes that they can sell to you that they can mandate that you put in your vehicle.
[00:54:00.044 --> 00:54:01.746]  And so this is a new profit center for them.
[00:54:01.806 --> 00:54:07.550]  And then they talk about how this was issued back in December of 2016, mid-December.
[00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:09.411]  They've been talking about this for a couple years.
[00:54:09.431 --> 00:54:11.233]  They finally proposed a detailed rule.
[00:54:11.293 --> 00:54:12.934]  And that's the way our laws are made, folks.
[00:54:13.595 --> 00:54:14.635]  Forget Schoolhouse Rock.
[00:54:15.416 --> 00:54:21.838]  The way your laws are made is you have some unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats propose rules.
[00:54:22.138 --> 00:54:27.880]  And they put them out there somewhere on, presumably, on a bulletin board in Washington, D.C., where nobody sees them.
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:33.322]  And if you don't respond to it, or even if you do, they're not required to pay any attention to your response.
[00:54:34.082 --> 00:54:38.823]  The only people who they're going to pay any attention to are going to be people that they call stakeholders.
[00:54:38.863 --> 00:54:43.265]  In other words, people who pay to play the Washington game.
[00:54:44.185 --> 00:54:46.286]  This is the problem that we have over and over again.
[00:54:46.326 --> 00:54:52.550]  Whether it's the EPA or whether it's the Department of Transportation, all these bureaucracies make the laws.
[00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:54.191]  Congress doesn't make the law anymore.
[00:54:54.231 --> 00:54:54.891]  They don't want to.
[00:54:54.931 --> 00:54:58.153]  That's why Nancy Pelosi said, well we have to pass Obamacare so we can find out what's in it.
[00:54:59.578 --> 00:55:03.702]  This is, and we had a similar statement from Paul Ryan about another piece of legislation.
[00:55:03.722 --> 00:55:05.383]  They know they're not putting the details in there.
[00:55:05.403 --> 00:55:07.285]  They know they're not crafting the rules.
[00:55:07.325 --> 00:55:12.249]  What they're doing is they're handing over broad powers to a bureaucracy which will pass the rules.
[00:55:12.289 --> 00:55:14.270]  Those rules will not be considered to be laws.
[00:55:14.651 --> 00:55:20.355]  So when you violate those rules, you will not get the protections of the Fourth and the Sixth Amendment.
[00:55:20.395 --> 00:55:23.298]  You will not have a right to confront your accusers, to have a trial.
[00:55:23.678 --> 00:55:31.460]  To bring witnesses in your defense you will not be protected against excessive fines because of course this is just a civil rule that you broke.
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:35.321]  But now they're telling us this is going to be done to quote-unquote save lives.
[00:55:35.361 --> 00:55:41.362]  Now we look at the potential for abuse this is far beyond writing multitudes of traffic tickets.
[00:55:41.622 --> 00:55:50.724]  Remember five years ago when now disgraced David Petraeus was head of the CIA and Wired Magazine talked about how he was bragging
[00:55:51.344 --> 00:56:02.673]  At an In-Q-Tel summit, and of course this is the venture capital firm for the CIA, we have a dark government that is even involved in handing out funds to preferred spy industries.
[00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:03.894]  That's what In-Q-Tel is.
[00:56:03.934 --> 00:56:07.076]  Nevertheless, he's at a summit, he's talking about the Internet of Things.
[00:56:07.116 --> 00:56:08.137]  He's very excited about it.
[00:56:08.177 --> 00:56:11.119]  He said, we will spy on you through your dishwasher.
[00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:17.705]  Well, they're going to spy on you through your car, because your car is going to be joining the Internet of Things sooner than you realize.
[00:56:18.565 --> 00:56:25.470]  And what he was saying at the time, he said, transformational is an overused word, but I do believe it properly applies to these technologies.
[00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:31.734]  Boy, it really does apply when you're talking about spying on people through their cars, through the highway that they travel on, doesn't it?
[00:56:32.054 --> 00:56:34.976]  He says, particularly their effect on the clandestine trade.
[00:56:35.656 --> 00:56:41.740]  All those new online devices are a treasure trove of data, says Wired, if you are a person of interest.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.842]  But of course, this was back in the pre-Snowden days.
[00:56:44.571 --> 00:56:48.274]  When people thought, oh, person of interest, that must mean somebody who has really done something.
[00:56:48.314 --> 00:56:52.177]  No, now we know that all of us are persons of interest.
[00:56:53.078 --> 00:56:55.140]  Because they have to get data from all of us.
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:57:05.508]  They have to get our metadata in order to put together their geospatial intelligence network, their human domain analytics, their activity-based intelligence, so they can master the human domain.
[00:57:06.269 --> 00:57:10.594]  They want to be able to look at all this data from everybody, so everybody is a person of interest.
[00:57:10.634 --> 00:57:12.496]  I hope you learned that with all the Snowden leaks.
[00:57:12.876 --> 00:57:18.042]  We now should all know that, even those people in the public who were sleeping comfortably five years ago.
[00:57:19.119 --> 00:57:23.502]  And they went on to say, once upon a time spies had to put a bug in your chandelier to hear your conversation.
[00:57:23.822 --> 00:57:34.908]  But now with the rise of the smart home, you'll be sending tagged, geolocated data that a spy agency can intercept in real time when you use the lighting app on your phone to adjust your living room's ambience.
[00:57:34.968 --> 00:57:38.090]  Well, these were the quaint days of five years ago.
[00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:40.892]  Things are getting much worse much more quickly.
[00:57:41.542 --> 00:57:47.823]  David Petraeus said that these household spy devices have changed our notions of secrecy.
[00:57:47.883 --> 00:57:48.423]  Yes, they have.
[00:57:48.523 --> 00:57:49.343]  They're taking it away.
[00:57:49.863 --> 00:57:52.664]  And, you know, there will be no privacy.
[00:57:53.244 --> 00:57:57.345]  There will be no freedom of mobility if we don't stop this.
[00:57:58.025 --> 00:58:04.186]  And, of course, when they talk about this, it's interesting to look at the actual documents from the Department of Transportation.
[00:58:04.506 --> 00:58:08.787]  When they talk about the vehicle to infrastructure issues, they talk about
[00:58:09.887 --> 00:58:12.809]  How it is going to affect the poor and the minorities.
[00:58:12.929 --> 00:58:15.831]  This is an environmental justice consideration document.
[00:58:15.871 --> 00:58:18.393]  This is how this bureaucracy works.
[00:58:18.853 --> 00:58:20.174]  Forget about the Sixth Amendment.
[00:58:20.214 --> 00:58:21.415]  Forget about the Fourth Amendment.
[00:58:21.435 --> 00:58:22.556]  Forget about any of this stuff.
[00:58:22.916 --> 00:58:25.498]  How does it affect the poor and the minorities?
[00:58:25.798 --> 00:58:28.700]  Not how does it affect your Bill of Rights as an individual.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:30.461]  And that brings us back to where we started.
[00:58:30.521 --> 00:58:36.585]  If we're going to only look at these body cams from the standpoint, are black people being affected by this?
[00:58:36.605 --> 00:58:39.447]  We have to understand everyone is being affected by this.
[00:58:40.188 --> 00:58:43.835]  And we will stand together or we will hang separately.
[00:58:44.476 --> 00:58:45.558]  That's it for tonight's news.
[00:58:45.578 --> 00:58:46.500]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:58:46.901 --> 00:58:49.426]  Join us again on Monday at 7 central, 8 p.m.
[00:58:49.466 --> 00:58:51.229]  Eastern for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:59:04.124 --> 00:59:09.927]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.388 --> 00:59:20.113]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.434 --> 00:59:24.176]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.736 --> 00:59:27.518]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.779 --> 00:59:36.003]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.323 --> 00:59:38.604]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.265 --> 00:59:41.706]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:59:42.087 --> 00:59:47.590]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:54.693]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:59:55.053 --> 00:59:59.895]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
