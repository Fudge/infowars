[00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:27.557]  On today's Live Friday edition, myself, David Knight, and others will be breaking down and laying out, obviously, the ongoing mental meltdown of the Democratic Party and the arrogant, deceptive corporate media.
[00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:35.101]  But in the next segment, I'm going to break down with Roger Stone the amazing accomplishments of Donald Trump.
[00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.355]  Namely, basically defeating ISIS.
[00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:40.657]  They admit it's in two small pockets now and has been destroyed.
[00:00:40.657 --> 00:00:43.559]  Something Obama and Hillary created.
[00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.424]  That said, I understand people that are critical of the tax cuts not being delivered and Obamacare not being repealed.
[00:00:51.424 --> 00:00:57.608]  And we see Republican leaders, people we can trust, like Rand Paul saying, the Senate Republicans don't want to get rid of it, they want it.
[00:00:57.608 --> 00:01:00.890]  Well of course, the Republican establishment with the Democrats wrote Obamacare.
[00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:12.360]  That's what's so frustrating about Democrats is they think it's like some goody they're getting and some free thing when Gruber and others are calling you dumb idiots with goldfish memories.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.461]  I mean, that's what's crazy.
[00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:15.923]  I know the Republicans are bad, the leadership.
[00:01:15.923 --> 00:01:19.587]  I know the Democrats' leadership is bad as well.
[00:01:19.587 --> 00:01:21.609]  I understand we're up against the entire establishment.
[00:01:22.898 --> 00:01:28.060]  Now some people sit there and think because I'm so supportive of Trump that I somehow support that establishment.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.441]  Trump is clearly against that establishment.
[00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:33.622]  He's trying to make deals with them and they're blocking him.
[00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:43.306]  He has to continue to rally the people and go after the Republican leadership as much as he goes after the Democrats because they are his enemy.
[00:01:43.306 --> 00:01:49.809]  And whereas the Democrats are more and more delusional and incompetent, led by the big winner, Pelosi, who thinks she's invincible.
[00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:55.329]  The Republicans are a much shrewder group of crooks at the top.
[00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.710]  Now I hope that Pence, the Vice President, can be trusted.
[00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.932]  I like him overall, but he's kind of a man between two worlds.
[00:02:00.932 --> 00:02:05.215]  Between establishment Republicans, evangelicals, and then of course the whole Trump populist movement.
[00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.135]  And I understand why Drudge and others have been critical of Trump trying to push him to be true on his agenda.
[00:02:12.135 --> 00:02:19.022]  But I think the larger issue, as Infowars has pointed out, and so has Drudge and others, is the Republican establishment.
[00:02:19.022 --> 00:02:23.907]  So I just want to keep that elephant in the room in the spotlight as much as possible.
[00:02:23.907 --> 00:02:25.609]  But I also want people to pull back and realize
[00:02:26.704 --> 00:02:35.891]  We just got a good Supreme Court nominee, and we're getting a lot of good things happening that I'll mention coming up in the next segment that I'll chronicle in studio with Roger Stone.
[00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:41.475]  But this is a really, really big time to be alive, and I just want people to realize it's not a lust for two evils.
[00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:42.736]  I want to push the Republicans.
[00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:45.217]  I want to remove the establishment Republicans.
[00:02:45.217 --> 00:02:46.799]  I want to take the whole country back.
[00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:47.979]  I want to make the Democrats a
[00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.501]  You know, basically land of fruits and nuts group only that can then be rehabilitated.
[00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:57.204]  They're already a coastal minority party.
[00:02:57.204 --> 00:03:01.712]  When I say minority, I mean liberal socialist communist views that we know are total failures.
[00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:10.167]  But at the same time, if we sit there and put our main focus on Trump and where he stumbles, that gives them aid and comfort.
[00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:14.391]  And if they take back over, they intend to pull up the free press.
[00:03:14.391 --> 00:03:22.337]  They intend to federalize the elections like Venezuela and bring us into an authoritarian system because they know we've rejected them.
[00:03:22.337 --> 00:03:23.978]  So we're facing true authoritarianism.
[00:03:24.987 --> 00:03:28.350]  And we're facing people that want to openly overthrow Trump.
[00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:37.458]  And a lot of folks are hedging their bets thinking that, you know, let's be somewhat critical of Trump because they might bring him down and we don't want to be associated with a loser.
[00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:38.619]  That's how we're going to lose.
[00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:46.045]  We have to be all in defending each other, defending the free press, defending other libertarian and conservative and nationalistic talk show hosts.
[00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:50.087]  Even though we don't all agree with each other 100%, we're not out to get the country.
[00:03:50.087 --> 00:03:51.648]  We want prosperity.
[00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:55.690]  We're pro-freedom, we're pro-gun, we're pro-free market, we're pro-low taxes.
[00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.031]  Look, Obama didn't get Obamacare for two years.
[00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:00.672]  If Trump gets rid of it in his first three or four, I'll be happy.
[00:04:00.672 --> 00:04:03.294]  We need to get rid of it quicker because it's about to bankrupt the economy.
[00:04:03.294 --> 00:04:04.474]  And of course, that's the other big issue.
[00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:06.015]  Trump's trying to get the economy going.
[00:04:06.015 --> 00:04:09.197]  It's had some big success, but the Fed's set to raise rates.
[00:04:09.197 --> 00:04:10.618]  Try to put a damper on that.
[00:04:10.618 --> 00:04:13.159]  It's clear, the whole global establishment is against Trump.
[00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:21.034]  And a lot of people in the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and also foreign governments and corporations think that there's strength in numbers.
[00:04:21.034 --> 00:04:24.699]  Not when globalism's tide is going out, and not when humanity is awake.
[00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:29.805]  It's our actions, and our political speech, and our financial actions that really do determine things.
[00:04:29.805 --> 00:04:31.828]  This is a people power issue.
[00:04:32.388 --> 00:04:36.071]  All right, back to the live transmission coming up after the break.
[00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:40.835]  We're going to lay out Trump's amazing accomplishments because it's something the globalists don't want to recognize.
[00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:42.396]  It's something the left doesn't want to hear.
[00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:48.801]  So we're going to celebrate our strengths, but also expose our weaknesses so we can improve them and fix them and move on.
[00:04:48.801 --> 00:04:51.363]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:04:51.363 --> 00:04:52.624]  It's a revolutionary act.
[00:04:52.624 --> 00:04:53.484]  Spread that link.
[00:04:53.484 --> 00:04:54.965]  So please continue, my friends.
[00:04:54.965 --> 00:04:56.967]  We're on the march and the empire is on the run.
[00:05:01.377 --> 00:05:06.221]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com with some patriotic quotes by Ron Paul.
[00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:14.968]  The most basic principle to being a free American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for our own lives and decisions.
[00:05:14.968 --> 00:05:19.172]  We do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make up for our own mistakes.
[00:05:19.372 --> 00:05:25.636]  Neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to live, so long as we aren't infringing on their rights.
[00:05:25.636 --> 00:05:30.178]  Freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones.
[00:05:30.178 --> 00:05:34.201]  If we are only free to make good decisions, then we are not really free.
[00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:41.285]  Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints.
[00:05:41.485 --> 00:05:47.609]  Random searches, mandatory identification cards, and paramilitary police in our streets.
[00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:50.731]  We have lost a vital part of our American heritage.
[00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:55.353]  America was born of protests, revolution, and mistrust of government.
[00:05:55.353 --> 00:05:59.376]  Subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long.
[00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:11.657]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:06:11.657 --> 00:06:13.717]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:06:13.717 --> 00:06:16.578]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:06:16.578 --> 00:06:18.078]  It's made in the USA.
[00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:24.900]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.140]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:36.688]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:53.500]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.663]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:06:56.783 --> 00:07:00.946]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a Z-Field at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:07:00.946 --> 00:07:10.453]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar, a 360 win.
[00:07:10.453 --> 00:07:17.018]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:07:17.018 --> 00:07:24.544]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:30.006]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:07:30.006 --> 00:07:36.108]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:07:36.108 --> 00:07:43.910]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:50.412]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature in InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:07:50.412 --> 00:07:51.913]  10% off on AutoShip.
[00:07:52.073 --> 00:07:54.518]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:54.518 --> 00:07:56.501]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[00:07:56.501 --> 00:08:00.349]  And all out-of-stock items are never out-of-stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:08:14.417 --> 00:08:17.560]  You're going to be so proud of your country if I get in.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.403]  You're going to be so proud of your president, and I don't care about that.
[00:08:21.403 --> 00:08:24.546]  But you are going to be so proud of your country.
[00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:28.769]  In terms of the presidential, I think they thought the same thing.
[00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:31.672]  Maybe there was overconfidence that who would vote for him.
[00:08:31.892 --> 00:08:35.435]  We're going to turn it around and we're going to start winning again.
[00:08:35.435 --> 00:08:37.256]  We're going to win so much.
[00:08:37.256 --> 00:08:38.997]  We're going to win at every level.
[00:08:38.997 --> 00:08:40.558]  We're going to win economically.
[00:08:40.558 --> 00:08:42.340]  We're going to win with the economy.
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.941]  We're going to win with military.
[00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:46.663]  We're going to win with health care and for our veterans.
[00:08:46.663 --> 00:08:49.705]  But the fact is, it doesn't matter who would vote for him.
[00:08:49.705 --> 00:08:52.787]  You have to be very positive about your own agenda.
[00:08:52.787 --> 00:08:58.171]  And that's what we're about right now as we go forward with our, hopefully, a successful attempt to win the Congress.
[00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:00.953]  We're gonna win with every single facet!
[00:09:00.953 --> 00:09:04.836]  We're gonna win so much, you may even get tired of winning!
[00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:06.036]  Thankfully we did an 05 and a 06.
[00:09:07.563 --> 00:09:11.006]  Republican president in the White House, Republican president in the White House.
[00:09:11.006 --> 00:09:18.494]  We're the voices, the Senate leader and I, are the voices for winning those races in our House and in the Senate.
[00:09:18.494 --> 00:09:22.317]  And you'll say, please, please, it's too much winning.
[00:09:22.317 --> 00:09:24.299]  We can't take it anymore.
[00:09:24.299 --> 00:09:26.401]  Mr. President, it's too much.
[00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:27.983]  And I'll say, no, it isn't.
[00:09:27.983 --> 00:09:29.404]  We have to keep winning.
[00:09:29.404 --> 00:09:30.746]  We have to win more.
[00:09:31.326 --> 00:09:39.990]  In fact, affecting California very directly is the Affordable Care Act.
[00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.291]  President Bush has come out against that, as you know.
[00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:48.213]  We're going to keep winning because we're going to make America great again!
[00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:48.693]  I love you!
[00:09:48.693 --> 00:09:49.253]  And we're ready.
[00:09:56.119 --> 00:09:58.201]  It's Friday the 14th of July 2017.
[00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:05.047]  We're gonna be live here for the next four hours and David Knight's gonna be in studio with Owen Schroer.
[00:10:05.047 --> 00:10:08.870]  We're gonna have Leanne McAdoo joining us via Skype and so much more.
[00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.353]  But I had to come in here at the very start of the transmission.
[00:10:12.913 --> 00:10:14.075]  With Roger Stone.
[00:10:14.075 --> 00:10:18.841]  He's here while we're engineering the launch of more broadcasts, more TV shows.
[00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:24.588]  So we've kind of got a staycation going on today as we prepare the next level of the info war.
[00:10:24.588 --> 00:10:30.836]  But we had to come in because we've gotten a little bit lackadaisical, myself included.
[00:10:30.836 --> 00:10:31.597]  We've gotten a little bit
[00:10:32.853 --> 00:10:34.694]  Instant gratification.
[00:10:34.694 --> 00:10:40.237]  We've gotten to the point where I think we just expect Trump to always be able to deliver.
[00:10:40.237 --> 00:10:54.806]  You know, they've had British members of Parliament come out who don't even agree with a lot of his policies but say he's an honorable man who'll go down in history as incredibly reviled by so many people because he actually did what he said he would do.
[00:10:54.806 --> 00:10:58.328]  So I'm not in some worship Trump fest here, okay?
[00:10:59.068 --> 00:11:15.082]  But compared to Hillary Clinton, and getting good Supreme Court nominees, and then getting the Supreme Court nominees seated, and seeing the globalists in a total tailspin, and witnessing the pullout of the TPP, and witnessing the pullout of the carbon tax, and it just goes on and on.
[00:11:15.082 --> 00:11:19.185]  60 plus percent down the level of illegals coming across the border.
[00:11:19.185 --> 00:11:21.788]  It was 40-something just a month into his administration.
[00:11:21.788 --> 00:11:25.171]  This is real action, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:26.192]  That's why the elites hate him.
[00:11:26.792 --> 00:11:30.813]  But then I was thinking today, the big one.
[00:11:30.813 --> 00:11:38.916]  I was driving in this morning listening to NPR and they were having to admit that ISIS is basically gone.
[00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:45.698]  It's only in one city in Syria and one city in Iraq and has basically been pushed into a few enclaves, a few neighborhoods.
[00:11:46.857 --> 00:11:47.838]  This is so massive.
[00:11:47.838 --> 00:11:51.461]  Trump said, we will knock out ISIS in the first six months.
[00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:53.102]  And they've basically done it.
[00:11:53.102 --> 00:11:54.323]  Our military's done it.
[00:11:54.323 --> 00:11:56.285]  And remember, it was Obama.
[00:11:56.285 --> 00:11:57.106]  It was Obama.
[00:11:59.284 --> 00:12:15.710]  With Hillary, and with the Arab Spring, and with the CIA, and with NATO, and with France that openly pushed the Arab Spring and turned all those countries over from Libya, to part of Syria, to Egypt, to Sunni-backed rebels out of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other areas.
[00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:16.610]  This is incredible!
[00:12:17.637 --> 00:12:24.741]  Our government did this, and there's Trump saying, Obama did it, but now it's my problem, I take responsibility, we're dealing with it.
[00:12:24.741 --> 00:12:25.522]  Total leadership.
[00:12:25.522 --> 00:12:26.862]  And then it hit me.
[00:12:26.862 --> 00:12:31.525]  And I said, Roger, we gotta, you know, get in here and get on air and talk about this.
[00:12:31.525 --> 00:12:33.246]  Because this is the big enchilada.
[00:12:33.246 --> 00:12:34.787]  It's the same thing with North Korea.
[00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:39.750]  It was the Clintons, on record, that gave them the reactors, the missile secrets, even the New York Times admits that.
[00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:53.155]  They're the ones that caused the current weaponization with Kim Jong-il and his son Kim Jong-un and Trump's cleaning that up again and getting the Russians to do something and getting the Chinese to do something because he's straight shooting him.
[00:12:53.155 --> 00:12:57.756]  He's not a globalist playing countries off against each other and they respect that.
[00:12:57.756 --> 00:13:01.858]  What he's done with ISIS and our military has done is incredible.
[00:13:01.858 --> 00:13:03.578]  But there aren't victory parades.
[00:13:03.578 --> 00:13:05.759]  He never told people he was even going in.
[00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:07.400]  He doesn't tell them when he's coming.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:07.940]  It's so
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.943]  Refreshing and real.
[00:13:10.943 --> 00:13:19.793]  It just boggles the mind that he's killing globalism and the strategic tension where they try to create the crises and create the boogeyman.
[00:13:19.793 --> 00:13:20.614]  It's amazing.
[00:13:20.614 --> 00:13:23.918]  And he wants reciprocal business deals that are good for both sides.
[00:13:23.918 --> 00:13:27.382]  Roger, I just wanted to come in here and talk about that, that Trump
[00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:37.586]  And our military have pretty much defeated the rebirth of Al-Qaeda, 20 times bigger, known as ISIS, instead of elements of our CIA and others working with radical Islam.
[00:13:37.586 --> 00:13:39.867]  He's saying, no, we're not selling out Europe and the U.S.
[00:13:39.867 --> 00:13:40.447]  to this.
[00:13:40.447 --> 00:13:42.828]  No, we're not bringing in millions of military age men.
[00:13:42.828 --> 00:13:44.569]  Ten millions enough already in Europe, U.N.'
[00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:45.409]  's numbers.
[00:13:45.409 --> 00:13:48.930]  I mean, it's amazing how good he is.
[00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.171]  I just have to tell the truth.
[00:13:51.171 --> 00:13:55.032]  I know it's popular to be anti-establishment, but the establishment's against Trump.
[00:13:55.032 --> 00:13:55.773]  People keep saying, Alex.
[00:13:56.733 --> 00:13:58.595]  He used to be anti-establishment, now you're for it.
[00:13:58.595 --> 00:13:59.996]  He's our beachhead.
[00:13:59.996 --> 00:14:01.558]  We're in the fight of our lives.
[00:14:01.558 --> 00:14:02.759]  This is history happening.
[00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.801]  Roger, we're teleprompter free.
[00:14:04.801 --> 00:14:06.463]  We didn't script this breakdown.
[00:14:06.463 --> 00:14:07.444]  Am I accurate?
[00:14:07.444 --> 00:14:08.845]  I think you're right on the money.
[00:14:08.845 --> 00:14:13.469]  What bothers me, Alex, or I should say annoys me, is the president's not getting the credit he deserves.
[00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.451]  Two weeks ago, I had the occasion to talk to the President of Somalia.
[00:14:18.451 --> 00:14:29.454]  There, the Trump-led attack on the ISIS insurgency, the local insurgency called Al-Shabaab, has the radicals on the run.
[00:14:29.454 --> 00:14:39.536]  The President doesn't blow his own horn, but whether it is foreign policy accomplishments or the fact that the national debt is down by $100 billion.
[00:14:39.536 --> 00:14:40.137]  Incredible!
[00:14:40.137 --> 00:14:41.777]  No, it's only been going up and up and up!
[00:14:42.137 --> 00:14:45.078]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, that's even bigger!
[00:14:45.078 --> 00:14:48.359]  And I remember seeing that and no one's even talking about it!
[00:14:48.359 --> 00:14:54.380]  But in the same time period, the national deficit was up $600 billion under Barack Obama.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:15:00.162]  This reminds me very much of Ronald Reagan, the S&P, hitting record levels.
[00:15:00.162 --> 00:15:02.083]  He gets no credit for that.
[00:15:02.083 --> 00:15:09.505]  So he's turning around the national economy, he's got ISIS truly on the run, and he's not getting the credit for it.
[00:15:09.505 --> 00:15:10.345]  He's got them KO'd.
[00:15:10.945 --> 00:15:16.748]  I mean, now they've gone from saying they're invincible to now whining and complaining and playing victim.
[00:15:16.748 --> 00:15:18.308]  It's true.
[00:15:18.308 --> 00:15:21.970]  You've got a different breed of cat in Donald Trump.
[00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.372]  He's not about bragging about his accomplishments.
[00:15:25.372 --> 00:15:28.733]  He's about turning around the situation.
[00:15:28.733 --> 00:15:32.615]  And he's not getting from the mainstream media the kind of credit that I think he deserves.
[00:15:33.135 --> 00:15:34.997]  Roger, you're absolutely right.
[00:15:34.997 --> 00:15:36.799]  Let's see if Harrison's in the control room.
[00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:40.522]  He's one of our great researchers and video editors, one of our new hires for the last six months.
[00:15:40.522 --> 00:15:41.863]  He's done a fabulous job.
[00:15:41.863 --> 00:15:50.831]  This morning I was talking about this in the hall and he heard me and said, that's what I'm working on is the first six months of Trump and his accomplishments.
[00:15:50.831 --> 00:15:53.934]  And again, you've got to give people credit when they do it.
[00:15:53.934 --> 00:15:56.717]  This is why the power structure is so scary.
[00:15:56.717 --> 00:15:58.479]  Harrison, what's your two cents to all this?
[00:15:59.479 --> 00:16:10.944]  Well, I just thought the six-month line would be a good one, because typically you do the 100 days, but if you look back at Trump's 100 days, a lot of good stuff had happened, but there was still a lot of stuff that was sort of unfinished.
[00:16:10.944 --> 00:16:14.065]  And now, just in the last couple weeks, so much stuff has happened.
[00:16:14.065 --> 00:16:18.227]  I mean, defeating ISIS, and getting the wall funded, and all these different things.
[00:16:18.227 --> 00:16:19.107]  Oh, that happened today!
[00:16:19.107 --> 00:16:21.668]  Oh, I mean- He figured the wall- or yesterday!
[00:16:22.809 --> 00:16:24.932]  You can't keep track of it!
[00:16:24.932 --> 00:16:25.793]  No, you can't keep track of it.
[00:16:25.793 --> 00:16:37.409]  I started listing it out and I mean by the end I had like 75 things and I was like I mean this video is gonna be long it's gonna be huge and and I you know it's just gonna be like you know I can't stump the Trump style thing it's just gonna be a celebration just saying
[00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:43.273]  Can we just take a moment and look back and see all the victories we've had over the last six months?
[00:16:43.273 --> 00:16:43.993]  It's really incredible.
[00:16:43.993 --> 00:16:44.554]  Exactly.
[00:16:44.554 --> 00:16:48.596]  I mean, he hasn't gotten rid of a lot of the deep state people because they're all rebelling against him.
[00:16:48.596 --> 00:16:49.396]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:16:49.396 --> 00:16:53.799]  With the power of the presidency, three trillion in the stock market, hundreds of billions of new jobs.
[00:16:53.799 --> 00:16:55.400]  It just makes the head spin.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.962]  The second amendment off the ropes.
[00:16:58.962 --> 00:17:01.264]  The travel ban of seven failed states.
[00:17:01.264 --> 00:17:05.208]  The S&P 500 hits 20 trillion for the first time.
[00:17:05.208 --> 00:17:09.391]  298,000 new jobs since Donald Trump became president.
[00:17:09.391 --> 00:17:12.774]  The manufacturing index at an all-time high.
[00:17:12.774 --> 00:17:14.436]  These are real accomplishments.
[00:17:14.956 --> 00:17:19.957]  I mean, I like Denton and others that said this couldn't happen, but I'm telling you, Trump did it.
[00:17:19.957 --> 00:17:25.738]  Well, and once he started talking about our NATO allies not paying their fair share, guess what?
[00:17:25.738 --> 00:17:30.939]  They coughed up $10 billion when we had been carrying their load.
[00:17:30.939 --> 00:17:34.480]  Again, due only to the leadership of Donald J. Trump.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.300]  You're absolutely right.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.760]  I saw Corsi in the control room.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.920]  Can we get him over there?
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.421]  I want to just, because this is unscripted, I just saw him in the control room there for camera.
[00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:44.822]  Doc, throw in a few of your points on this.
[00:17:44.822 --> 00:17:58.166]  Well, I've said from the beginning that Donald Trump is going to win, and he is, I think, gaining greater experience with how Washington works, and will very shortly, I think, be able to turn the situation around, even in the White House.
[00:17:58.166 --> 00:17:59.907]  Some basic changes have got to occur.
[00:17:59.907 --> 00:18:01.807]  He's got to fire Priebus, in my opinion.
[00:18:01.807 --> 00:18:06.709]  He's got to get the people in the White House out who are not Trump loyalists.
[00:18:07.469 --> 00:18:09.851]  And it's not New York City.
[00:18:09.851 --> 00:18:13.394]  In Washington, the first premise is everybody's going to lie to you.
[00:18:13.394 --> 00:18:16.016]  And people are going to tell you they're your friends when they're your enemies.
[00:18:16.016 --> 00:18:18.698]  Trump has got to be able to sort this out, and I think he will.
[00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:19.399]  Because it's law land.
[00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:23.822]  It's not people who want to be in business with you for 50 years and who want you to know they can count on you.
[00:18:23.822 --> 00:18:29.567]  It's a bunch of screw jobs, mentally ill scum and parasites, and he's got to understand that.
[00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:31.208]  But what's his greatest accomplishment?
[00:18:31.408 --> 00:18:39.130]  I think it's breaking political correctness's will, letting us know that globalism is poison, and letting us know it's good to be proud to be Americans again.
[00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.811]  He's breaking the spirit of the parasites, Doc.
[00:18:41.811 --> 00:18:45.392]  Well, I think he's done a huge job in exposing fake news.
[00:18:45.392 --> 00:18:55.675]  I think American people are really now attuned to what InfoWars is all about, which is that there's lying going on constantly by a government-controlled media.
[00:18:55.675 --> 00:18:56.095]  That's right.
[00:18:56.095 --> 00:18:57.595]  We're out of time for this segment.
[00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:59.596]  David Knight is coming up right after this break.
[00:19:00.316 --> 00:19:02.377]  And remember, there's more silver linings here.
[00:19:02.377 --> 00:19:05.960]  We have Pelosi saying she is a winner, she is victory.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.563]  I mean, this is the icing on the cake is how delusional and out of control they are.
[00:19:10.563 --> 00:19:11.404]  So it's amazing.
[00:19:11.404 --> 00:19:11.964]  Thanks, Doc.
[00:19:11.964 --> 00:19:12.825]  Thank you, Harrison.
[00:19:12.825 --> 00:19:14.906]  And thank you, Roger Stone, being here in town with us.
[00:19:14.906 --> 00:19:15.446]  Great to be here.

[00:19:18.849 --> 00:19:20.009]  It's a revolutionary act.
[00:19:20.009 --> 00:19:23.572]  Spread those articles and videos and jam them down the globalist's throats.
[00:19:23.572 --> 00:19:24.853]  So let's keep it up.
[00:19:24.853 --> 00:19:26.614]  More live straight ahead.
[00:19:31.317 --> 00:19:33.979]  I'm not going to give you a question.
[00:19:33.979 --> 00:19:35.760]  You are fake news.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.982]  Your organization
[00:20:02.165 --> 00:20:14.676]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[00:20:14.676 --> 00:20:18.900]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[00:24:09.856 --> 00:24:11.297]  Reports.

[00:24:14.218 --> 00:24:16.980]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[00:24:25.123 --> 00:24:26.404]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:26.404 --> 00:24:28.945]  I'm David Oyed on this Friday, July 14th, 2017.
[00:24:28.945 --> 00:24:31.926]  We've got a lot of news coming up.
[00:24:31.926 --> 00:24:42.710]  Tell you what, it's a bipartisan swamp and this video with Bill Clinton and George W. just reminds you how there is no difference.
[00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:47.832]  As many said, there's not a dime's worth of difference between the Republican and Democrat Party establishment.
[00:24:47.832 --> 00:24:50.113]  And we're seeing that now with Obamacare as well.
[00:24:50.113 --> 00:24:53.875]  And I think this pathetic video that we see, we've got an article up at Infowars.com
[00:24:54.855 --> 00:24:58.597]  We're talking about how Bill Clinton is not looking too healthy here.
[00:24:58.597 --> 00:25:01.799]  He's chewing his tongue, his hand is quivering during the appearance.
[00:25:01.799 --> 00:25:18.808]  But when I look at this, and we'll show you this video, when I look at this, and when I listen to these guys, what I see is the decrepit state of a dying establishment, desperate to unify against Trump and against the American people who elected him.
[00:25:18.808 --> 00:25:21.490]  They are desperate to do anything that they can.
[00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:22.490]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:23.351]  Let's play that clip.
[00:25:23.951 --> 00:25:26.332]  And listen to what they have to say, those of you watching it.
[00:25:26.332 --> 00:25:31.675]  You can see Bill Clinton as his hand is shaking, his lips are quivering, and you can hear it in his voice.
[00:25:31.675 --> 00:25:33.956]  That's something his voice has been with him for a long time.
[00:25:33.956 --> 00:25:36.036]  But let's take a look at that clip.
[00:25:36.036 --> 00:25:41.679]  If you want to be president, realize it's about the people, not about you.
[00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:47.682]  And when it's over, and that's what a lot of these people who are real arrogant in the office, they forget.
[00:25:47.682 --> 00:25:49.983]  Time passes.
[00:25:49.983 --> 00:25:51.623]  And it passes more quickly than you know.
[00:25:54.454 --> 00:26:01.597]  You want to be able to say, people were better off when I quit, kids had a better future, things were coming together.
[00:26:01.597 --> 00:26:08.180]  You don't want to say, God, look at all the people I beat, or the people I worked over.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:14.583]  I think the most important thing is to be humble, to listen, to realize everybody's got a story.
[00:26:14.583 --> 00:26:15.444]  All the things I learned as a kid.
[00:26:15.444 --> 00:26:20.286]  Listen, the only thing you disagreed with in my platform was that Texas ought to take Arkansas.
[00:26:23.041 --> 00:26:27.704]  What I disagreed with is he wanted to get all of our water and not pay very much money for it.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:41.283]  The Royalty of England and the Royalty of Russia and Germany, that sort of thing.
[00:26:41.283 --> 00:26:43.844]  They see themselves as an uncollected part of the elite establishment.
[00:26:43.844 --> 00:26:46.786]  You see this picture of Bill Clinton, not looking too good.
[00:26:46.786 --> 00:26:56.793]  As a matter of fact, I think he's looking worse than Jimmy Carter, who just passed out doing some home improvements as part of his charitable work in Canada.
[00:26:56.793 --> 00:26:57.973]  It wasn't all that heavy.
[00:26:59.134 --> 00:27:01.136]  Jimmy Carter's 92 years old.
[00:27:01.136 --> 00:27:04.479]  He's still working at Habitat Humanity doing things.
[00:27:04.479 --> 00:27:08.882]  And that's a real difference from what we see with Barack Obama.
[00:27:08.882 --> 00:27:13.486]  In the past, we have seen presidents do things like Jimmy Carter.
[00:27:13.486 --> 00:27:14.707]  They would write their memoirs.
[00:27:14.707 --> 00:27:18.530]  They would basically get out of politics when their time in Washington was over.
[00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.872]  We didn't see that with Barack Obama.
[00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:26.877]  And we're not seeing that now with Bill Clinton and with George W. They're coming out and directly criticizing Donald Trump.
[00:27:26.877 --> 00:27:27.117]  Why?
[00:27:27.978 --> 00:27:32.560]  Because Donald Trump is going in a different direction, quite obviously, and they understand that.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.483]  Now, when you look at his health situations, you see his trembling hand.
[00:27:37.483 --> 00:27:39.244]  In 2013, he denied he had Parkinson's.
[00:27:39.244 --> 00:27:40.524]  He said he'd gone to a doctor.
[00:27:40.524 --> 00:27:43.526]  He told Huffington Post, he said, I went to a doctor because my hand's been shaking.
[00:27:44.497 --> 00:27:47.118]  He said, uh, I wanted to make sure that it was Parkinson's.
[00:27:47.118 --> 00:27:49.279]  They said it wasn't, but he didn't say what it was.
[00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:52.120]  Uh, what kind of, uh, situation that he has here.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.982]  That's, uh, so anyway, we'll, we'll, uh, get back to that.
[00:27:54.982 --> 00:27:57.323]  But what I want to focus on is Obama.
[00:27:58.294 --> 00:28:04.079]  Because we had this lawsuit come out at the beginning of the week, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:07.182]  Suing the Trump campaign and suing Roger Stone.
[00:28:07.182 --> 00:28:15.470]  And this was a group that was the White House, headed by Obama's White House counsel, a guy named Ian Bassin.
[00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:18.212]  And the name of the group is United to Protect Democracy.
[00:28:18.212 --> 00:28:22.236]  As we pointed out when this broke live on the Nightly News Wednesday night,
[00:28:23.217 --> 00:28:31.762]  We talked about the fact that they named this group after a phrase that was in Obama's farewell speech, except Obama didn't go farewell.
[00:28:31.762 --> 00:28:33.263]  Obama stayed in Washington.
[00:28:33.263 --> 00:28:43.990]  And we talked about that at the time, how unusual that was, that he set up a residence there, he brought in Eric Holder, said we're going to get involved in redistricting, we're going to have a lot of lawsuits.
[00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:46.291]  Eric Holder, of course, is Attorney General.
[00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:52.355]  They're going to lawyer up and they're going to have lawsuits against various states trying to win in court
[00:28:53.095 --> 00:28:55.656]  What they lost in the elections.
[00:28:55.656 --> 00:29:06.998]  Because remember, state houses, looking at state offices across the country and congressional offices, the Democrats lost over 1,000 offices under Barack Obama.
[00:29:06.998 --> 00:29:12.019]  And so what they're going to do is they're going to focus on trying to change gerrymandering laws.
[00:29:12.019 --> 00:29:16.980]  They had no problem with gerrymandering when they were the majority, but now they do.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.201]  And so we had Barack Obama this week
[00:29:19.781 --> 00:29:25.304]  His former White House counsel and the group, United to Protect Democracy, taken from Obama's farewell address.
[00:29:25.304 --> 00:29:27.004]  They sued Roger Stone.
[00:29:27.004 --> 00:29:32.107]  And we're going to tell you what Obama did last night and the importance of this.
[00:29:32.107 --> 00:29:33.507]  They're not going to take this line down.
[00:29:33.507 --> 00:29:42.211]  So it's got Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, the entire Washington establishment arrayed against Donald Trump.
[00:29:42.211 --> 00:29:46.854]  And I would say also arrayed against his agenda to try to change Obamacare.
[00:29:46.854 --> 00:29:47.434]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.074 --> 00:29:54.020]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.684]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.619 --> 00:30:16.506]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[00:30:16.506 --> 00:30:20.808]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[00:30:20.808 --> 00:30:22.769]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[00:30:23.349 --> 00:30:26.050]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:32.694]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[00:30:32.694 --> 00:30:37.416]  What kind of leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[00:30:37.416 --> 00:30:41.158]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[00:30:41.738 --> 00:30:44.221]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[00:30:44.221 --> 00:30:49.228]  Adams also said, liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.

[00:30:51.871 --> 00:30:53.774]  Educate yourself and others.
[00:30:53.774 --> 00:30:55.596]  The truth shall set you free.
[00:30:55.596 --> 00:30:57.419]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:31:01.109 --> 00:31:03.010]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:05.031]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:05.031 --> 00:31:07.913]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:07.913 --> 00:31:13.997]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:13.997 --> 00:31:20.221]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems.
[00:31:20.501 --> 00:31:23.184]  ...have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:31:23.184 --> 00:31:30.714]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:30.714 --> 00:31:38.743]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:38.743 --> 00:31:39.704]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:40.917 --> 00:31:44.861]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:48.424]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:48.424 --> 00:31:55.149]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:59.233]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[00:32:01.184 --> 00:32:06.966]  Today, I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[00:32:06.966 --> 00:32:15.870]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for AutoShip to receive out-of-stock products like DNA Force, and we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:23.533]  When it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[00:32:23.533 --> 00:32:29.655]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes,
[00:32:30.015 --> 00:32:33.057]  NAR Lipoic Acid, Bio-PQQ and many others.
[00:32:33.057 --> 00:32:37.760]  Bio-PQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.542]  And just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.

[00:33:06.275 --> 00:33:08.797]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.797 --> 00:33:10.799]  I'm David Knight.
[00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:15.903]  On this Friday, July 14, 2017, we were just talking about Barack Obama and his active opposition.
[00:33:15.903 --> 00:33:18.345]  Far more active than the slander that we saw
[00:33:34.395 --> 00:33:39.740]  Bill Clinton and George W. engage in that forum that we just played for you.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:49.129]  What Barack Obama is doing, and we talked about this at the very beginning, he brings in Valerie Jarrett, actually was living with him in the house that he bought, that he was renting in Washington, to stay there.
[00:33:49.129 --> 00:33:49.829]  Unprecedented.
[00:33:49.829 --> 00:33:52.031]  We haven't had any presidents do that.
[00:33:52.031 --> 00:33:54.754]  Remember we had George Washington essentially set the
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:05.749]  Uh, set the pattern, uh, like Cincinnatus, the Roman, uh, leader, he went back to his farm, went back to the plow.
[00:34:05.749 --> 00:34:10.313]  He imposed a two-term limit on himself voluntarily and then got out of it.
[00:34:10.313 --> 00:34:19.321]  And that's been the tradition of our presidents, with the exception of Woodrow Wilson, who still was not active the way Barack Obama is becoming active.
[00:34:20.181 --> 00:34:25.343]  Thursday night, last night, he headed a fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.
[00:34:25.343 --> 00:34:26.643]  Now what is this?
[00:34:26.643 --> 00:34:34.966]  This is the organization, we reported this earlier, said he's going to have Eric Holder work with him to sue legislatures across the country.
[00:34:34.966 --> 00:34:35.366]  Why?
[00:34:35.366 --> 00:34:39.727]  Because under Barack Obama, the Democrats lost over 1,000 seats.
[00:34:39.727 --> 00:34:43.828]  So what they can't win at the ballot box, they want to win in court.
[00:34:43.828 --> 00:34:45.189]  That's the way these guys operate.
[00:34:45.189 --> 00:34:47.429]  That's what they're trying to do across the country.
[00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:48.330]  They're trying to tie up
[00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:54.472]  Trump's agenda and his valid executive orders that he has the right to do this.
[00:34:54.472 --> 00:34:57.153]  This is something that even the Supreme Court upheld.
[00:34:57.153 --> 00:34:59.653]  And of course, there's been another move on that today.
[00:34:59.653 --> 00:35:08.696]  A Hawaiian judge, when we get to that later, came back and said, oh, well, you know, they said family members and you interpreted that as immediate family members.
[00:35:08.696 --> 00:35:13.678]  But we're going to interpret that as the entire extended family, anybody that can prove some kind of relationship.
[00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:15.959]  to these people will be allowed to come in.
[00:35:15.959 --> 00:35:18.921]  So that's the way they continue to roll in the courts.
[00:35:18.921 --> 00:35:21.683]  But I want to give you an example of why this is important.
[00:35:21.683 --> 00:35:27.788]  Understand that gerrymandering is something that has been around from the very beginning of our republic.
[00:35:27.788 --> 00:35:35.013]  And that is creating bizarre districts to try to favor one party or the other.
[00:35:36.075 --> 00:35:39.077]  They looked at one of these districts that was drawn and said, looks like a salamander.
[00:35:39.077 --> 00:35:48.963]  And of course, it's gotten to a real precise science now, where they can jump from one side of the road to the other side with the computerized databases that they've had.
[00:35:48.963 --> 00:35:51.104]  And that's been there for decades.
[00:35:51.104 --> 00:35:56.988]  And a good example of the way this has worked, that applies to Obama, is what I saw in North Carolina when I was living there.
[00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:58.028]  I was watching it very closely.
[00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:02.693]  North Carolina went for Barack Obama.
[00:36:02.693 --> 00:36:08.237]  Just two years later, there was a massive blowback against that.
[00:36:08.237 --> 00:36:14.903]  The Democrats basically lost every statewide election, but they didn't lose any seats in Congress.
[00:36:14.903 --> 00:36:16.364]  That was the only exception.
[00:36:16.364 --> 00:36:17.465]  Why?
[00:36:17.465 --> 00:36:20.187]  Because of gerrymandering that the Democrats have always done.
[00:36:20.187 --> 00:36:25.212]  The Democrats had always controlled the state legislature since Reconstruction.
[00:36:26.249 --> 00:36:31.900]  And for the first time, the state legislature changed hands and North Carolina became Republican.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.563]  Now, 2010 was an important year.
[00:36:34.235 --> 00:36:39.498]  That was the year that they did the census, and it was the year that they redrew the districting lines.
[00:36:39.498 --> 00:36:52.587]  So, understand, remember, they took all of the State, House, and Senate, and they took all the statewide elections, except for Congress, because that was set up with the redistricting rules.
[00:36:52.587 --> 00:37:02.754]  So, with the ability to redraw the districting lines in 2010, the Republicans did so to their advantage, as the Democrats have always done for centuries.
[00:37:03.926 --> 00:37:08.749]  And the next election, the Republicans got a majority of the seats in Congress.
[00:37:08.749 --> 00:37:15.854]  So now what the Democrats have done is they've already sued in North Carolina, and they're going to do this across the country.
[00:37:15.854 --> 00:37:22.198]  They say Republicans currently control legislatures in 32 of the 50 states, thanks to Obama.
[00:37:23.323 --> 00:37:24.846]  We can thank Obama for that.
[00:37:24.846 --> 00:37:33.904]  And so what they're going to do is they're going to be suing everybody, tying everyone up in court to get this through, just as we saw this frivolous lawsuit that was put out.
[00:37:35.161 --> 00:37:38.284]  against Roger Stone and against the Trump campaign.
[00:37:38.284 --> 00:37:39.264]  They're third parties.
[00:37:39.264 --> 00:37:45.349]  As Roger Stone was saying, they haven't even proven that these documents from the DNC were hacked.
[00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:47.110]  Julian Assange said they weren't.
[00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:48.972]  He said there wasn't a state actor involved.
[00:37:48.972 --> 00:37:53.615]  And certainly, Roger Stone and the Trump campaign would be a third party to that.
[00:37:53.615 --> 00:37:58.319]  But they're going to continue to do that, to try to get publicity, to try to fundraise off of that.
[00:37:58.999 --> 00:38:03.584]  And the other was an interesting story that I saw on The Guardian about what's going on in Hong Kong.
[00:38:03.584 --> 00:38:07.908]  I think it's a good example of where we're going with this absurdity when they
[00:38:09.046 --> 00:38:13.907]  Use any pretext to manipulate our elections.
[00:38:13.907 --> 00:38:19.269]  You know, Hong Kong was free for a hundred years, essentially, under British rule.
[00:38:19.269 --> 00:38:22.710]  The British ruled it with a very, very light hand, especially towards the end.
[00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:25.571]  They let the Hong Kong people be free.
[00:38:25.571 --> 00:38:28.992]  Milton Friedman did a series in 1980 called Free to Choose.
[00:38:28.992 --> 00:38:29.712]  He talked about how
[00:38:30.572 --> 00:38:35.834]  The Hong Kong people had such incredible freedom because the government didn't take much interest in them.
[00:38:35.834 --> 00:38:37.215]  So they had liberty there.
[00:38:37.215 --> 00:38:39.676]  And I traveled there when we adopted my daughter.
[00:38:39.676 --> 00:38:41.397]  We were there for a while.
[00:38:41.397 --> 00:38:42.317]  I thought it was interesting.
[00:38:42.317 --> 00:38:44.518]  We were looking at the money.
[00:38:44.518 --> 00:38:50.381]  And I was looking at the different denominations and they looked radically different in terms of design, in terms of color.
[00:38:50.381 --> 00:38:55.643]  And it's like, wait a minute, this is, you know, twenty Hong Kong dollars and it's issued by
[00:38:56.303 --> 00:39:01.506]  This one bank, and here's another one that's issued by another bank, and I realize these are private banks that are issuing the currency.
[00:39:01.506 --> 00:39:03.067]  They didn't have a central bank.
[00:39:03.067 --> 00:39:09.150]  I mean, it was the closest thing to America before the Civil War that you could find in the world.
[00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:11.931]  That's why Milton Friedman talked about how free they were.
[00:39:11.931 --> 00:39:19.936]  The problem was that in 1997, their 100-year lease that the British had obtained at the point of a gun with the Chinese government, that ran out.
[00:39:20.737 --> 00:39:26.222]  And so the issue at that point was, well, are they going to fight China to keep Hong Kong free?
[00:39:26.222 --> 00:39:28.003]  The British weren't interested in Hong Kong.
[00:39:28.003 --> 00:39:29.144]  That's one of the reasons they were free.
[00:39:29.144 --> 00:39:31.867]  So they turned it over to the Chinese government.
[00:39:31.867 --> 00:39:36.651]  They got a concession from them saying they would treat them as a separate autonomous region.
[00:39:36.651 --> 00:39:38.753]  We're now 20 years after that.
[00:39:38.753 --> 00:39:44.118]  And now the main line Chinese government is really starting to come down hard on them.
[00:39:44.118 --> 00:39:45.219]  And a good example of this
[00:39:45.979 --> 00:39:52.411]  Is a Hong Kong court has disqualified four pro-democracy lawmakers for failing to sincerely take the oath of office.
[00:39:53.354 --> 00:39:59.156]  They say their disqualification means that pro-democracy camp has lost its veto power over major legislation.
[00:39:59.156 --> 00:40:08.019]  One of the most powerful tools in a parliament that is stacked with pro-establishment, that would be pro-mainline communist Chinese legislators.
[00:40:08.019 --> 00:40:14.181]  Communist Chinese are really coming down hard on the Hong Kong people and they are pushing back.
[00:40:14.181 --> 00:40:17.362]  Listen to what some of these people did when they took their oath of office.
[00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:24.177]  One of them prefaced his oath with a quote from Gandhi and a pledge to serve the Hong Kong people.
[00:40:24.177 --> 00:40:26.060]  The Chinese communists say that disqualifies you.
[00:40:27.216 --> 00:40:28.116]  You can't serve.
[00:40:28.116 --> 00:40:29.637]  We're going to remove you from office.
[00:40:29.637 --> 00:40:32.259]  Another one did a slow-motion reading of the oath.
[00:40:32.259 --> 00:40:34.520]  She paused for six seconds between each word.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:38.622]  She took ten minutes to read the 77-word declaration.
[00:40:38.622 --> 00:40:41.503]  And so they threw her out.
[00:40:41.503 --> 00:40:44.725]  Said, you did not show enough respect to this oath.
[00:40:44.725 --> 00:40:45.425]  Okay?
[00:40:45.425 --> 00:40:53.269]  Then in another one, a guy whose nickname is Longhair, he held a yellow umbrella during his oath, which is a symbol of the city's 2014 democracy protests.
[00:40:55.070 --> 00:41:05.615]  And the court wrote, the manner in which he took the oath goes well outside an objective, reasonable range of such requisite solemnity and sincerity.
[00:41:05.615 --> 00:41:16.420]  So we look at this and we say, is this any more ridiculous than what the Democrats are doing with this fake Russian red herring narrative?
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.900]  It isn't any sillier than that.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.442]  And as one of the people there said, ordinary people don't have a lot of power in Hong Kong.
[00:41:21.442 --> 00:41:23.123]  We don't have a lot of power here in America, do we?
[00:41:24.031 --> 00:41:28.254]  Now this most important right, the right of our elected officials, has been stolen from us.
[00:41:28.254 --> 00:41:30.555]  What is the point of elections if they're meaningless?
[00:41:30.555 --> 00:41:52.250]  What is the point of elections if we can have the courts and the lawyers, the Democrat courts and the Democrat lawyers and our former presidents basically shut this down and tie us up with nonsense charges that make absolutely no more sense than to take somebody out of office because they're making a political statement as they're taking their oath of office.
[00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:54.391]  That's just absolutely amazing.
[00:41:54.391 --> 00:41:57.613]  Of course, they've had other people that have been removed from this.
[00:41:57.613 --> 00:41:59.134]  And that's what we're seeing in Hong Kong.
[00:41:59.134 --> 00:42:01.076]  But the people there are really angry.
[00:42:01.076 --> 00:42:02.017]  They're really fighting back.
[00:42:02.017 --> 00:42:15.546]  You know, there was a couple of years ago that Mainland China tried to institute a propaganda curriculum in Hong Kong that would teach about Mao and talk about the benefits of communism and everything.
[00:42:15.546 --> 00:42:18.588]  These are people, understand, who have lived free.
[00:42:19.741 --> 00:42:20.722]  And they're not taking that.
[00:42:20.722 --> 00:42:23.504]  They took to the street by the thousands.
[00:42:23.504 --> 00:42:24.846]  Do Americans care about that?
[00:42:24.846 --> 00:42:28.809]  Do Americans even know the agenda that is being put out there that we just had?
[00:42:28.809 --> 00:42:37.637]  At the beginning of July, we had the National Educational Association, the NEA, the Teachers Union.
[00:42:37.637 --> 00:42:46.525]  They had a convention, and in that convention, they talked about how they're going to use NEA funds to push open borders, to push the LGBTQ agenda.
[00:42:47.458 --> 00:42:52.082]  These are radical political agendas that are being taught to our children.
[00:42:52.082 --> 00:42:54.363]  We don't even care about that.
[00:42:54.363 --> 00:42:55.664]  Nobody's taking to the streets.
[00:42:55.664 --> 00:42:57.926]  Nobody's taking their kids out of the schools.
[00:42:57.926 --> 00:43:06.973]  The people in Hong Kong are paying attention and we need to look and see what happens if you lose your ability to really care about things.
[00:43:06.973 --> 00:43:12.377]  If you become so apathetic that you don't know or care what people are even doing to your children.
[00:43:13.089 --> 00:43:14.310]  Meanwhile, we've got fake news.
[00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:15.030]  This is another article.
[00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:16.330]  It's on Infowarriors.com.
[00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:18.171]  Today's fake CNN news.
[00:43:18.171 --> 00:43:19.352]  Let's blow up Russia.
[00:43:19.352 --> 00:43:23.053]  We've got a clip from a longtime Clinton supporter.
[00:43:23.053 --> 00:43:27.455]  This is an article by Steve Watson on Infowarriors.com today.
[00:43:27.455 --> 00:43:33.437]  Paul Begala, he openly called for a discussion on bombing Russia.
[00:43:33.437 --> 00:43:37.819]  This would be funny if it wasn't so insane.
[00:43:37.819 --> 00:43:41.781]  I mean, we are living in Dr. Strangelove.
[00:43:42.501 --> 00:43:50.789]  I remember it was Oliver Stone when he went to do this long-form interview with Vladimir Putin, actually sat down and watched Dr. Strangelove with him.
[00:43:50.789 --> 00:44:00.178]  I guess it was an explanation of our current political environment, kind of a crash course for Vladimir Putin to understand the insanity of America.
[00:44:00.178 --> 00:44:04.442]  That's a dark comedy, but this is a dark reality that we're living in.
[00:44:04.442 --> 00:44:05.884]  Let's play some of that clip.
[00:44:07.534 --> 00:44:12.257]  Patriotic American should subvert an election with a hostile foreign power.
[00:44:12.257 --> 00:44:14.037]  That is what Donald Trump Jr.
[00:44:14.037 --> 00:44:19.060]  agreed to do with Mr. Kushner and Mr. Manafort in the meeting.
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.562]  We were and are under attack by
[00:44:22.842 --> 00:44:23.742]  Unbelievable.
[00:44:23.742 --> 00:44:26.183]  There's Anderson Cooper.
[00:44:26.183 --> 00:44:27.103]  He's taking this seriously.
[00:44:27.103 --> 00:44:28.064]  They're not laughing at him.
[00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:48.611]  Unbelievable!
[00:44:48.611 --> 00:44:49.551]  Unbelievable!
[00:44:49.551 --> 00:44:50.172]  Over the top!
[00:44:50.172 --> 00:45:04.440]  And I just reported earlier this week how CNN is winning all these awards for a documentary that they did in Syria, blaming everything that happened in Aleppo on the other side, not on their people, their people being ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:16.328]  And they got access to shoot this documentary, go where other journalists had been killed, they got access to get in there by working with an English propagandist for Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:17.188 --> 00:45:19.710]  Or for ISIS, whatever you want, however you want to brand it.
[00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:23.734]  I mean, you talk about CNN being ISIS, that is quite literally true.
[00:45:23.734 --> 00:45:27.177]  Absolutely insane what CNN is doing.
[00:45:27.177 --> 00:45:30.019]  Every day it gets more and more dangerous.
[00:45:30.019 --> 00:45:36.745]  You know, all this talk about ramping up war, and of course this is something Democrats were doing well before the election.
[00:45:37.822 --> 00:45:49.054]  Saying that we're going to be looking at cyberattacks and if we ascertain or believe that these cyberattacks are coming from Russia, we will take that as if that were a physical attack on us and we will respond appropriately.
[00:45:49.054 --> 00:45:54.100]  In other words, we're going to bomb people if we think that we got a cyberattack from you.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.883]  Well, who knows where these cyberattacks are coming from?
[00:45:56.883 --> 00:45:59.165]  That's not something you can easily ascertain.
[00:46:00.086 --> 00:46:15.493]  Anybody who is honest about this, anybody who knows what's going on, John McAfee talked about this well before we had the latest WikiLeaks of Vault 7 that showed that they have, and actually WikiLeaks was responsible, they did not leak out the code.
[00:46:15.493 --> 00:46:26.678]  What they leaked out were the PDF owner's manuals, if you will, the documentation on how these programs operate to show what their capability is, but not to give people the code to actually do it.
[00:46:27.492 --> 00:46:32.794]  And what we saw with that was that they had numerous ways that they could mask themselves, and we knew that was happening.
[00:46:32.794 --> 00:46:42.778]  Everybody that was responsible, we talked to William Binney, we talked to John McAfee, all these people said, look, all these people have the ability to disguise where they're coming from in a number of ways.
[00:46:42.778 --> 00:46:52.722]  They can reroute it, and as we learned with Vault 7, they can even make the keyboard strokes and so forth that people have gone back forensically to try to identify what country this comes from.
[00:46:52.722 --> 00:46:55.983]  They can make all of that look like they're coming from any country that they wish.
[00:46:57.426 --> 00:47:17.894]  And so when they say we're going to give ourselves the ability to, or say that we're going to physically start a war with Russia, if we ascertain that there was a cyber attack conducted against us by them, what they're saying is we're going to give ourselves the ability to just come up with any excuse to start a war, to do a first strike.
[00:47:18.871 --> 00:47:20.152]  And that's a very dangerous thing.
[00:47:20.152 --> 00:47:23.876]  That's something the Democrats have been doing since before the election.
[00:47:23.876 --> 00:47:33.046]  It's one of the reasons why they got General Flynn out so quickly, because he was rational, he was honest, and they had to get him out, the military-industrial complexes.
[00:47:33.046 --> 00:47:40.173]  I want to take a look at the Emmy Awards, because I think this is part of this continuum that we saw with Bill Clinton.
[00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:56.217]  With George W., that we saw with Obama's legal issues, and of course, remember, it's not just the political establishment, it's not just the media, CNN, but the most important tool that they have is entertainment.
[00:47:57.329 --> 00:48:01.833]  Remember Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals.
[00:48:01.833 --> 00:48:05.676]  The most effective weapon is ridicule, he said.
[00:48:05.676 --> 00:48:07.337]  And so we see Saturday Night Live.
[00:48:07.337 --> 00:48:08.538]  They love Saturday Night Live.
[00:48:08.538 --> 00:48:12.881]  Saturday Night Live got, I think it was 22 nominations.
[00:48:12.881 --> 00:48:16.344]  They tied Westworld for first place nominations.
[00:48:16.344 --> 00:48:18.666]  This was because they're coming after President Trump.
[00:48:18.666 --> 00:48:23.050]  And so when we look at the Emmys, we already know who the winner is.
[00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.612]  The winner is anybody who is anti-Trump.
[00:48:26.783 --> 00:48:31.325]  And you have to understand that the Emmys and the Oscars, they're not important.
[00:48:31.325 --> 00:48:33.045]  Even if you like the shows, they're not important.
[00:48:33.045 --> 00:48:36.447]  You have to understand this is something that's done by the community.
[00:48:36.447 --> 00:48:39.408]  This is like a high school election.
[00:48:40.316 --> 00:48:43.278]  We're the most popular people win the election.
[00:48:43.278 --> 00:48:46.520]  It has nothing to do with the quality of the shows.
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.862]  It has everything to do with whether or not they like you.
[00:48:48.862 --> 00:48:49.962]  Remember Sally Fields?
[00:48:49.962 --> 00:48:50.643]  They like me!
[00:48:50.643 --> 00:48:52.364]  They really, you really like me!
[00:48:52.364 --> 00:48:54.285]  It's a popularity contest!
[00:48:54.285 --> 00:48:58.408]  She just won class president when she got that Oscar nomination.
[00:48:58.408 --> 00:49:00.029]  They know what it is.
[00:49:00.029 --> 00:49:02.291]  It's their own peers that nominate them.
[00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:05.553]  And you know, if you're a conservative, you get shown the door.
[00:49:05.553 --> 00:49:08.535]  You're not only not going to get a nomination, you're not even going to get a job.
[00:49:08.535 --> 00:49:09.736]  You're going to get blacklisted.
[00:49:10.492 --> 00:49:12.653]  That's what they do to conservatives.
[00:49:12.653 --> 00:49:23.535]  But when we look at this, we've got the LA Times pointing it out, it was a big year for Saturday Night Live, 22 nominations, no doubt due to the show's non-stop lampooning of President Trump and his associates.
[00:49:23.535 --> 00:49:33.838]  Likewise, they said, Stephen Colbert returned to his political ways, made his way back to the race with the Late Show, and also Handmaid's Tale, because that's highly political.
[00:49:33.838 --> 00:49:38.239]  They tried to target that at Trump and conservatives, completely ignoring
[00:49:39.019 --> 00:49:46.846]  That everything that they have in The Handmaid's Tale is going on far worse in Saudi Arabia and countries under Sharia law.
[00:49:46.846 --> 00:49:55.093]  Their worst dystopian nightmare that they say would be brought about by Christians in office is going on in Sharia law.
[00:49:55.093 --> 00:49:58.856]  It was Christians in office who gave us the First Amendment.
[00:49:58.856 --> 00:50:02.999]  It was Christians in office who gave us the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:07.984]  It was Christians who, after the revolution, did not become dictators and tyrants.
[00:50:07.984 --> 00:50:19.636]  But if you want to see the handmaid's tale, and if you want to see something that is far worse than the handmaid's tale, then do a documentary on what's going on in Islamic countries.
[00:50:19.636 --> 00:50:22.279]  Because Islam is not a religion.
[00:50:22.279 --> 00:50:25.282]  It is a political system that is supported by a religion.
[00:50:25.282 --> 00:50:26.964]  The two are inextricable.
[00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:37.264]  The Caliphate is a fulfillment of their religion, and if they don't have a worldwide Caliphate, that is a disgrace to their religion.
[00:50:37.264 --> 00:50:43.906]  Meanwhile, when we come back, I'm going to talk about the Vatican getting involved in this, coming out of that truce with the Pope.
[00:50:43.906 --> 00:50:45.547]  Didn't last too long with Donald Trump.
[00:50:45.547 --> 00:50:53.290]  You know, they shook hands and met, but now the Vatican is coming out after Trump and after conservative Catholics and evangelical Christians.
[00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:53.850]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.127 --> 00:51:02.007]  It's a no-brainer.
[00:51:02.007 --> 00:51:04.388]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[00:51:04.388 --> 00:51:12.430]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:14.351]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[00:51:14.351 --> 00:51:18.012]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[00:51:18.012 --> 00:51:22.674]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[00:51:22.674 --> 00:51:27.075]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[00:51:27.075 --> 00:51:27.715]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:51:31.156 --> 00:51:35.397]  Nearly one third of FBI domestic terrorism cases involve refugees.
[00:51:35.397 --> 00:51:36.277]  One third.
[00:51:36.277 --> 00:51:38.278]  There's already been riots across Europe.
[00:51:38.278 --> 00:51:39.498]  Is America next?
[00:51:39.498 --> 00:51:41.778]  Hi, I'm the owner of Infidel Body Armor.
[00:51:41.778 --> 00:51:46.979]  Over the past four years, I've sold thousands of body armor kits and trained hundreds of sheepdogs.
[00:51:46.979 --> 00:51:48.300]  They have prepared.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:49.320]  Have you?
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:53.981]  I invite you to go to my website at infidelbodyarmor.com and click on specials.
[00:51:53.981 --> 00:51:55.141]  Trouble is coming.
[00:51:55.141 --> 00:51:56.661]  Now do something about it.
[00:51:56.661 --> 00:51:59.702]  Infidelbodyarmor.com just won't quit.
[00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:02.491]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:52:02.491 --> 00:52:05.713]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[00:52:05.713 --> 00:52:07.315]  Savory and delicious.
[00:52:07.315 --> 00:52:10.137]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:52:10.137 --> 00:52:10.797]  Awesome.
[00:52:10.797 --> 00:52:13.900]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.461]  NASA PAC Technology.

[00:52:16.082 --> 00:52:20.245]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[00:52:20.245 --> 00:52:21.686]  Or warm and served.
[00:52:21.686 --> 00:52:23.728]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:52:23.728 --> 00:52:25.669]  10-year shelf life bacon.
[00:52:25.669 --> 00:52:28.472]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com.

[00:53:03.878 --> 00:53:13.501]  If you're a 50-year-old male, maybe a bit porky, and you may even have type 2 diabetes, a million dollars of term insurance may only cost you about 200 bucks a month.
[00:53:13.501 --> 00:53:14.642]  Call term providers.

[00:53:53.221 --> 00:53:53.561]  Call 800-476-5281.
[00:53:53.561 --> 00:53:53.601]  800-476-5281.
[00:54:13.338 --> 00:54:21.765]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:21.765 --> 00:54:22.365]  I'm David Knight.
[00:54:22.365 --> 00:54:27.048]  On this Friday, July 14th, 2017, Leanne McAdoo is going to be joining us in the next hour.
[00:54:27.048 --> 00:54:30.691]  She's got a report about glyphosate that she wants to talk about.
[00:54:30.691 --> 00:54:34.094]  Of course, we're also going to talk about Russia, China, cyber espionage.
[00:54:34.094 --> 00:54:35.154]  You know, as we look at the
[00:54:36.195 --> 00:54:39.277]  politicization of our intelligence community.
[00:54:39.277 --> 00:54:40.378]  I think we need a new word.
[00:54:40.378 --> 00:54:47.042]  I think we need to, instead of calling it espionage, we need to call it elect-spionage.
[00:54:47.042 --> 00:54:48.804]  I have to write that out for you so you get it.
[00:54:48.804 --> 00:54:50.885]  Elect-spionage.
[00:54:50.885 --> 00:54:55.868]  And it's kind of like Rich Hall used to do, if you remember that comedian who did Sniglet's coined words.
[00:54:55.868 --> 00:54:56.889]  That's really what's going on.
[00:54:56.889 --> 00:54:59.451]  That's the thing that really concerns me much more than
[00:55:00.411 --> 00:55:08.195]  Russia's involvement is the involvement of the NSA, the involvement of the FBI that's been pointed out by the FISA court that they broke the law.
[00:55:08.195 --> 00:55:09.875]  The FISA court made the ruling.
[00:55:09.875 --> 00:55:11.776]  They declassified it.
[00:55:11.776 --> 00:55:19.319]  We have our intelligence community, this massive surveillance state, has now become involved in politics.
[00:55:19.319 --> 00:55:20.520]  Very politicized.
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:22.461]  That's something we should be very, very concerned about.
[00:55:22.461 --> 00:55:27.203]  The people in Washington are the ones who should be the most concerned about that.
[00:55:28.046 --> 00:55:32.788]  I want to get back to this story about what the Pope is doing in terms of getting involved in our elections.
[00:55:32.788 --> 00:55:39.312]  Before I do, real quickly, I remind you that we have extended our July 4th specials through the month of July.
[00:55:39.312 --> 00:55:46.616]  It is now the July Summer Mega Specials, now live at InfoWarsStore.com for limited time plus free shipping.
[00:55:47.256 --> 00:55:48.157]  That's very important.
[00:55:48.157 --> 00:55:49.938]  Free shipping, folks.
[00:55:49.938 --> 00:55:53.741]  If only we could get the kind of deal that Amazon does.
[00:55:53.741 --> 00:55:57.183]  I think it's like a dollar and a half per box subsidy from the U.S.
[00:55:57.183 --> 00:55:57.704]  Post Office.
[00:55:57.704 --> 00:55:59.745]  We'll talk about that later in the show as well.
[00:55:59.745 --> 00:56:02.467]  But we have discounts on top of the free shipping.
[00:56:02.467 --> 00:56:03.668]  Free shipping is store-wide.
[00:56:03.668 --> 00:56:05.330]  Anything that you buy, free shipping.
[00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:15.214]  But we also have 30% off of Brain Force Plus, Super Male Vitality, Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, our Gut Health Support Pack.
[00:56:15.214 --> 00:56:17.115]  All of those are 30% off.
[00:56:17.115 --> 00:56:23.857]  Our select storable food is not only free shipping, but 30 to 40% off the usual retail price.
[00:56:23.857 --> 00:56:25.018]  And we have Secret 12.
[00:56:25.018 --> 00:56:27.439]  That's our vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:56:27.439 --> 00:56:31.701]  We can get the same effect as you would taking a painful injection, taking it orally.
[00:56:31.701 --> 00:56:35.002]  It's very easy to take, great tasting, just put it under your tongue.
[00:56:35.442 --> 00:56:37.023]  25% off retail.
[00:56:37.023 --> 00:56:39.825]  DNA Force is now back in stock and on sale.
[00:56:39.825 --> 00:56:40.665]  20% off.
[00:56:40.665 --> 00:56:42.746]  That is one of our premier products.
[00:56:42.746 --> 00:56:45.208]  Very expensive to produce.
[00:56:45.208 --> 00:56:47.729]  Very expensive ingredients.
[00:56:47.729 --> 00:56:49.170]  And that is 20% off.
[00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:50.531]  That's a big savings.
[00:56:50.531 --> 00:56:59.416]  While supplies last, you can get those discounts as well as free shipping storewide as part of our July Summer Mega Specials at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:01.337]  And we really do appreciate your support.
[00:57:01.337 --> 00:57:02.458]  That's what funds our operation.
[00:57:03.018 --> 00:57:04.339]  We don't get subsidies from the U.S.
[00:57:04.339 --> 00:57:04.919]  Post Office.
[00:57:04.919 --> 00:57:11.463]  We don't get subsidies from George Soros or any government organization or private organization.
[00:57:11.463 --> 00:57:16.026]  We just fund it by offering you the best quality products we can find for your health.
[00:57:16.026 --> 00:57:22.070]  And again, we're going to be talking about glyphosate and how to protect yourself from that coming up with Leanne McAdoo in the next hour.
[00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:32.236]  You know, I have Donald Trump in Paris today, and I should mention that I've got a poll that will be ending today that I put up on my Twitter account, Libertarian, about Macron.
[00:57:32.967 --> 00:57:35.208]  You know, they're shaking hands or anything.
[00:57:35.208 --> 00:57:38.269]  You know, Macron held court in Versailles.
[00:57:38.269 --> 00:57:40.529]  People say, what is he, some kind of a monarchist?
[00:57:40.529 --> 00:57:43.750]  He's threatening Parliament, saying, you better not block my reforms.
[00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:46.931]  And I'm going to cut the number of people in Parliament.
[00:57:46.931 --> 00:57:49.112]  He's going to reduce their number of representatives.
[00:57:49.112 --> 00:57:55.234]  I mean, that's one of the things we need to do to get back control of our government, is to increase the number of representatives that we have.
[00:57:55.234 --> 00:57:56.834]  That's another discussion for another day.
[00:57:56.834 --> 00:57:58.395]  But he's also uniting with Merkel.
[00:57:58.895 --> 00:58:02.998]  And so I asked people in the poll, I said, what does he see himself as?
[00:58:02.998 --> 00:58:05.340]  What does he want to be when he grows up?
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:06.941]  This little guy, Macron.
[00:58:06.941 --> 00:58:09.203]  Does he want to be the leader of Vichy France?
[00:58:09.203 --> 00:58:13.046]  Because, you know, we've now put the Germans in charge of unified Europe.
[00:58:13.046 --> 00:58:14.687]  That's what Hitler always wanted.
[00:58:14.687 --> 00:58:15.948]  Does he want to be Oedipus Rex?
[00:58:15.948 --> 00:58:20.132]  This is a guy who married his high school teacher that he fell in love with when he was 15 years old.
[00:58:20.732 --> 00:58:22.693]  Or does he want to be Marie Antoinette?
[00:58:22.693 --> 00:58:25.734]  Right now the leader in all of this poll is all of the above.
[00:58:25.734 --> 00:58:30.157]  So you can join that poll if you want and tell Macron what you think of him.
[00:58:30.157 --> 00:58:30.977]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:30.977 --> 00:58:41.542]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.542 --> 00:58:45.224]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.224 --> 00:58:47.185]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:52.586 --> 00:58:56.391]  MycoZX is back in after five plus months sold out.
[00:58:56.391 --> 00:58:57.893]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[00:58:57.893 --> 00:58:59.596]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[00:58:59.596 --> 00:59:02.039]  Latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[00:59:02.039 --> 00:59:03.240]  It's been sold out for months.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:04.122]  Big waiting list.
[00:59:04.122 --> 00:59:07.967]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[00:59:07.967 --> 00:59:08.828]  Nobody's got something this
[00:59:08.868 --> 00:59:09.548]  We're good to go.
[00:59:30.194 --> 00:59:31.575]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:10.228 --> 01:00:16.090]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:21.513]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:21.513 --> 01:00:21.993]  I'm David Knight.
[01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:24.694]  Leanne McAdoo will be joining us in the next segment.
[01:00:24.694 --> 01:00:27.715]  I want to talk about what the Vatican is doing in terms of opposing Trump.
[01:00:27.715 --> 01:00:32.017]  Remember we had the 30 minute meeting that Donald Trump took with the Pope?
[01:00:32.779 --> 01:00:34.501]  They had a quiet face-to-face meeting.
[01:00:34.501 --> 01:00:36.262]  It had been pretty contentious before that.
[01:00:36.262 --> 01:00:43.569]  Remember during the election, we had the Pope criticizing, calling on Christians the idea that we would have borders.
[01:00:43.569 --> 01:00:51.936]  The Pope is an open border socialist world government and he wants the world government to save the climate and so forth.
[01:00:51.936 --> 01:00:53.357]  That's where this guy's coming from.
[01:00:53.357 --> 01:00:55.620]  Total New World Order Pope.
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:56.300]  He is the
[01:00:57.794 --> 01:01:02.903]  The religious, ethical face that the New World Order is using to sell this agenda.
[01:01:03.866 --> 01:01:15.110]  And so even though they had that meeting, now the Vatican press has lashed out at Catholic Trump voters and calls Steve Bannon a supporter of apocalyptic geopolitics.
[01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:17.251]  This is from Zero Hedge.
[01:01:17.251 --> 01:01:19.131]  Listen to some of the quotes from this.
[01:01:19.131 --> 01:01:24.473]  This is a Jesuit priest who is the editor of this Vatican publication.
[01:01:24.473 --> 01:01:29.235]  He had a 2,700 word paper that he put out this week and
[01:01:30.535 --> 01:01:35.380]  He said there was a surprising meeting of minds between some Catholic voters in the U.S.
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.181]  and the Evangelical Christian Right.
[01:01:37.181 --> 01:01:48.092]  So he's upset about the fact that conservative Catholics and Evangelical Christians come together on things like abortion and same-sex marriage.
[01:01:48.092 --> 01:01:53.056]  He said they harbor a nostalgic dream of a theocratic type of state.
[01:01:53.902 --> 01:02:00.725]  Well, we know that the Vatican is selling their dream of a secular humanist world government.
[01:02:00.725 --> 01:02:11.130]  He said those who profess themselves to be Catholic express themselves in ways that until recently were unknown in their tradition and they're using tones that are much closer to evangelicals.
[01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:16.832]  He said they're xenophobic, they're Islamophobic, they want walls, they want deportation.
[01:02:16.832 --> 01:02:19.954]  See, this is the globalism that is now endemic.
[01:02:20.914 --> 01:02:21.995]  in the Vatican.
[01:02:21.995 --> 01:02:25.177]  So some conservative Catholics have been outraged by the piece.
[01:02:25.177 --> 01:02:44.930]  One conservative Catholic blog said that due to the unprecedented nature and the direct attack that it makes on the United States, its current administration, American evangelicals, conservative Catholics in the United States and Europe and Africa, combined with the rise of Islamism, the article's overreach is nothing if not breathtaking.
[01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:50.294]  And of course the Pope is going to continue his anti-Trump pro-globalist agenda.
[01:02:51.014 --> 01:02:56.543]  Just remember when they came out with this climate encyclical.
[01:02:56.543 --> 01:03:00.028]  One of the four guys who read it, who wrote it, was a guy John Schellenhuber.
[01:03:00.894 --> 01:03:05.638]  He is a German climate expert, a self-appointed expert.
[01:03:05.638 --> 01:03:16.587]  But this is a guy who rejoices in the fact that if we don't do anything, the whole world is going to melt down and our population is going to be reduced from 7 to under 1 billion people.
[01:03:16.587 --> 01:03:19.249]  That's going to be more than an 85% reduction.
[01:03:19.249 --> 01:03:20.310]  So he's happy about that.
[01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:24.293]  He said that's a triumph for us because we could stabilize our population.
[01:03:24.833 --> 01:03:30.337]  And this is a guy who has proposed that we have a global democratic society.
[01:03:30.337 --> 01:03:32.578]  He wants an earth constitution.
[01:03:32.578 --> 01:03:33.999]  He wants a global council.
[01:03:33.999 --> 01:03:38.082]  He wants a planetary court that they can haul you before.
[01:03:38.082 --> 01:03:46.267]  And understand, as we see Macron meeting with Donald Trump, it was very important for Donald Trump to get out of that Paris climate agreement.
[01:03:46.267 --> 01:03:47.408]  We never will really end.
[01:03:47.408 --> 01:03:50.410]  We had Obama say he was going to self-ratify that.
[01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:54.053]  He was going to sign it because he knew that the Congress is not going to ratify that agreement.
[01:03:54.853 --> 01:03:58.334]  But it was important to shut that thing down.
[01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:09.717]  And in response, we had Macron come out and say, well, in 22 years we will ban all internal combustion engines, which 99% of the French people choose over electric.
[01:04:09.717 --> 01:04:12.638]  Only 1% of the people in France buy electric cars.
[01:04:12.638 --> 01:04:13.538]  They're going to shut that down.
[01:04:13.538 --> 01:04:17.979]  And at the same time, they're going to shut down the sources of electricity.
[01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:21.320]  They're going to shut down fossil fuels and even nuclear power.
[01:04:22.436 --> 01:04:26.377]  I, you know, that's why I say, Macron needs to grow up.
[01:04:26.377 --> 01:04:28.597]  This guy is on another planet.
[01:04:28.597 --> 01:04:31.658]  He thinks that he is, he referred to himself as Jupiter.
[01:04:31.658 --> 01:04:34.239]  I mean, seriously, this is not, we're not making this up.
[01:04:34.239 --> 01:04:37.759]  This guy is major delusional.
[01:04:37.759 --> 01:04:43.821]  So is Al Gore, saying that the fight to save the planet is like the fight to end slavery.
[01:04:43.821 --> 01:04:47.522]  No, it is a social agenda, and people admit that.
[01:04:47.522 --> 01:04:49.202]  Stay with us, we'll be right back with Leanne McAdoo.
[01:05:01.474 --> 01:05:03.395]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[01:05:03.395 --> 01:05:05.316]  That all men are created equal.
[01:05:05.316 --> 01:05:08.999]  That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.
[01:05:08.999 --> 01:05:12.441]  That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:19.485]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[01:05:19.485 --> 01:05:28.611]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.
[01:05:30.265 --> 01:05:32.066]  Independence isn't a day.
[01:05:32.066 --> 01:05:33.107]  It's a mindset.
[01:05:33.107 --> 01:05:35.868]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[01:05:35.868 --> 01:05:37.489]  I will not be your slave.
[01:05:37.489 --> 01:05:43.553]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[01:05:43.553 --> 01:05:48.516]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[01:05:48.516 --> 01:05:50.397]  Slaves are never safe.
[01:05:50.397 --> 01:05:53.399]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[01:05:53.399 --> 01:05:54.500]  Guard your liberty.
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.842]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[01:05:57.842 --> 01:05:59.723]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:06:03.865 --> 01:06:05.266]  Let's go to Devin in Florida.
[01:06:05.266 --> 01:06:07.508]  Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:06:07.508 --> 01:06:07.968]  Great!
[01:06:07.968 --> 01:06:09.089]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:06:09.089 --> 01:06:13.612]  Listen, I have bought your product and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:06:13.612 --> 01:06:22.899]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:06:22.899 --> 01:06:23.640]  Wow, thank you.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:26.142]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[01:06:26.142 --> 01:06:27.963]  Which nutraceutical do you like best?
[01:06:27.963 --> 01:06:31.426]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[01:06:31.426 --> 01:06:31.886]  That's amazing.
[01:06:31.926 --> 01:06:36.528]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:36.528 --> 01:06:37.849]  It's the win-win, Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:10.112]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:10.112 --> 01:07:18.515]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:18.515 --> 01:07:23.396]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:23.396 --> 01:07:27.037]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee.
[01:07:28.257 --> 01:07:28.857]  We're good to go.
[01:07:52.247 --> 01:07:58.528]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:07:58.528 --> 01:08:12.651]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:12.651 --> 01:08:20.773]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:24.951]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:24.951 --> 01:08:25.611]  I'm David Knight.
[01:08:25.611 --> 01:08:31.574]  On this Friday, July 14, 2017, we're going to be joined by Leanne McAdoo, who's been on extended leave.
[01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:34.335]  She's in Florida, so she's joining us via Skype.
[01:08:34.335 --> 01:08:39.737]  We're going to talk about election issues, but we're also going to talk about health issues.
[01:08:39.737 --> 01:08:42.919]  We had a story earlier this week pointing out that in the UK,
[01:08:43.959 --> 01:08:49.941]  You're more likely to get cancer than you are to get married or to have children for the first time.
[01:08:49.941 --> 01:08:53.823]  Just as likely to have cancer than to get a college degree.
[01:08:53.823 --> 01:08:57.004]  It's becoming something of a rite of passage for all of us.
[01:08:57.004 --> 01:09:00.865]  And it's because of what we have in our food and our water.
[01:09:00.865 --> 01:09:04.087]  So Leanne has a report about glyphosate.
[01:09:04.087 --> 01:09:04.607]  Welcome Leanne.
[01:09:05.877 --> 01:09:07.077]  David, great to be here.
[01:09:07.077 --> 01:09:11.539]  That's incredible, the story you just brought up about cancer being the new normal.
[01:09:11.539 --> 01:09:13.140]  Yeah, oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:17.181]  It's increasing as birth rates are going down, that's another part of this as well.
[01:09:17.181 --> 01:09:31.606]  It's not just, they want to tell us that that's simply societal changes that people want to have careers, that delaying having children and everything, but it's also the chemicals that they're putting in the water make it difficult for people once they decide they want to have kids, to have kids.
[01:09:31.606 --> 01:09:33.767]  And so that's a big part of the
[01:09:34.287 --> 01:09:37.891]  Tell us a little bit about this report and let's play this report for people.
[01:09:44.679 --> 01:09:53.327]  Well, this is actually a story that Rob Dew sent to my attention, a positive story, another win, another victory for the consumer.
[01:09:53.327 --> 01:09:58.833]  We've got a new tool to help us choose wisely at the grocery store and other places.
[01:09:58.833 --> 01:10:07.061]  Obviously, the Non-GMO Project is a great label to look for, but now we can start looking for a glyphosate residue-free food label.
[01:10:07.521 --> 01:10:24.254]  So, there's actually a number of products on the market right now that have already kind of paved the way for products like your cooking oils and your mayonnaise, your condiments, things like that that people don't really think about but we use all the time with every meal essentially.
[01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:27.396]  So, it's a glyphosate residue-free certification.
[01:10:27.396 --> 01:10:35.603]  It's a new label that you can begin to look for and it's a really positive thing as well because it's going to start pushing
[01:10:36.283 --> 01:10:53.017]  Farmers say in India to go more organic and to get away from these pesticide laden foods and genetically modified frankenfoods that they are pushing on us in their great big science experiment and then of course pushing this narrative that cancer is totally normal.
[01:10:53.397 --> 01:11:00.264]  Yeah, they just put up an article as you were talking about a Tennessee area that put restrictions on the use of glyphosate.
[01:11:00.264 --> 01:11:01.766]  And that's something that people need to realize.
[01:11:01.766 --> 01:11:11.316]  I always thought about it, living in a rural area, we filter our water because even though you don't have somebody adding fluoride to your water, if you've got well water,
[01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:19.822]  You have people who are growing agricultural products, if they're using glyphosate, that gets down into the well water that you're going to have.
[01:11:19.822 --> 01:11:25.386]  But you're talking about it being systemic in all of these different products that you don't even think about.
[01:11:25.386 --> 01:11:30.149]  You think about it being in water, but you don't realize that it sends so many other products.
[01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:33.452]  Let's take a quick look at your report and we'll talk about that afterwards.
[01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:43.672]  There's a new tool in the arsenal when it comes to taking back your health.
[01:11:43.672 --> 01:11:50.115]  A company is now going to make it easier than ever for you to avoid pesticides when choosing your food products.
[01:11:50.115 --> 01:11:54.637]  They are introducing the new glyphosate residue-free food labeling.
[01:11:54.637 --> 01:11:59.160]  And this is all thanks to that consumer-based push for transparency.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:06.083]  Chosen Foods and Heavenly Organics are two food makers that already have several products out on the market.
[01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:19.930]  But the director of the Detox Project, who is the creator and owner of this glyphosate residue-free label, says that the certification will enable food manufacturers to give consumers what they really want.
[01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:22.432]  Glyphosate residue-free food.
[01:12:22.432 --> 01:12:33.778]  Now there's been a lot of pushback in recent years with people understanding that the toxicity standards, the tests that they have for testing both non-organic and organic foods is very weak.
[01:12:34.398 --> 01:12:39.581]  Of course, if you're someone who's trying to sell organic, you're already having to jump through a lot of regulatory hoops.
[01:12:39.581 --> 01:12:43.723]  It costs a lot of money for farmers to go organic.
[01:12:43.723 --> 01:12:48.666]  For some reason, they really try to make it hard for the organic farmers to thrive in this country.
[01:12:48.666 --> 01:12:54.890]  But even so, with that, the toxicity testing is very low, very weak, and
[01:12:55.430 --> 01:13:04.697]  Beyond that, you don't know what you're going to get in your condiments, in your salad dressings, your mayonnaise, even some of your most favorite snacks, and of course your cooking oils.
[01:13:04.697 --> 01:13:12.883]  So this company is trying to make it very easy for you to just choose right away and make sure that you are avoiding glyphosate
[01:13:13.223 --> 01:13:17.766]  And hopefully in the future some of these other insecticides that are hitting the market.
[01:13:17.766 --> 01:13:22.010]  We know glyphosate is the most widely used insecticide that is out there.
[01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:27.574]  Of course this was the herbicide that was used for Monsanto's genetically modified crops.
[01:13:27.574 --> 01:13:37.601]  But something that was really interesting, in 2015 the World Health Organization labeled glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans.
[01:13:37.601 --> 01:13:38.262]  It's probably
[01:13:38.902 --> 01:13:40.242]  Probably could give you cancer.
[01:13:40.242 --> 01:13:42.803]  Mmm, tasty.
[01:13:42.803 --> 01:13:44.884]  And so people had, they were just in shock at this.
[01:13:44.884 --> 01:13:45.464]  What are you saying?
[01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:47.805]  You're spraying this poison all over our foods.
[01:13:47.805 --> 01:13:54.828]  But right about the same time, another chemical company was right on the heels of Monsanto.
[01:13:54.828 --> 01:14:01.370]  And while all eyes were on Monsanto, Dow Chemical was coming up with their own genetically modified crops as well.
[01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:07.172]  And so they were creating their own herbicide that they would spray on their crops.
[01:14:07.172 --> 01:14:16.495]  Because remember, a lot of crops have become resistant to glyphosate, which means that these farmers were having to spray even more glyphosate on the crops.
[01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:24.418]  So Dow Chemical comes up with their own version of crops, which people haven't got their pitchforks out just yet to come after Dow Chemical.
[01:14:25.118 --> 01:14:31.703]  So the EPA, when all this is going on at the World Health Organization saying, yeah, you probably shouldn't be spraying that poison on your crop.
[01:14:31.703 --> 01:14:33.084]  It might give you cancer.
[01:14:33.084 --> 01:14:38.248]  They go ahead and approve Dow Chemicals herbicide blend.
[01:14:38.248 --> 01:14:41.531]  It was called Enlist Duo and they said,
[01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:54.455]  Not only were they going to pass it through and approve this for use on their crops, but they also, the amount of pesticides that they were going to allow them to spray on the crops was just insane.
[01:14:54.455 --> 01:15:00.716]  Tons of pesticide that they were going to allow to be sprayed and get into the soil of our earth.
[01:15:00.716 --> 01:15:02.117]  It would spread to the water.
[01:15:02.117 --> 01:15:11.879]  So, interestingly, thanks to a lot of pushback, the EPA was actually forced to revoke the approval of that Dow herbicide for their GMO crops.
[01:15:12.619 --> 01:15:24.147]  And in a court filing back in 2015, they said, you know, the EPA discovered new information suggesting that the herbicide could be more toxic than previously believed.
[01:15:24.147 --> 01:15:30.812]  So, of course, this was due to a lot of that consumer-based pushback where people were saying, what are you thinking?
[01:15:30.812 --> 01:15:35.615]  You're labeling one insecticide as probably carcinogenic, yet you're granting access.
[01:15:36.315 --> 01:15:43.479]  To another company to come and do the same with a whole new version of products that we haven't even begun to fight against.
[01:15:43.479 --> 01:15:46.061]  Environmental Protection Agency.
[01:15:46.061 --> 01:15:48.742]  Looks like they wised up a little bit, at least in this case.
[01:15:48.742 --> 01:15:54.065]  And that's of course due to active consumers out there who are pushing back against this stuff.
[01:15:54.065 --> 01:15:56.947]  But I wanted to draw your attention to some of these products.
[01:15:56.947 --> 01:16:02.450]  They've got a lot of, like I said, cooking oils, condiments and snacks and things they have launched.
[01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:03.891]  But Heavenly Organics,
[01:16:04.591 --> 01:16:04.991]  I think?
[01:16:26.164 --> 01:16:32.869]  Now, of course, a lot of people wanted to say, oh, well, they had alcoholism or family problems, mental issues that weren't addressed.
[01:16:32.869 --> 01:16:36.112]  But a lot of people, a lot of social activists were saying, no.
[01:16:36.112 --> 01:16:52.145]  The common denominator here in, you know, 8 out of 10 cases was that these farmers were very indebted to these banks because they were sold the story that if they went ahead and bought the GM crop, BT cotton and others specifically.
[01:16:52.725 --> 01:16:52.985]  That's
[01:17:11.261 --> 01:17:13.103]  Killing themselves in mass numbers.
[01:17:13.103 --> 01:17:18.429]  In 2004 alone, 18,000 plus farmers committed suicide.
[01:17:18.429 --> 01:17:21.773]  So this is just one more tool that you can use when you're out shopping.
[01:17:21.773 --> 01:17:24.536]  I really love the non-GMO project label.
[01:17:24.536 --> 01:17:26.559]  I'm seeing it everywhere now.
[01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:31.625]  For instance, I was just trying to buy some artichokes the other day and there was about 30 different varieties on the shelf.
[01:17:32.185 --> 01:17:38.250]  And I was able to narrow it down quickly to just three brands, thanks to this non-GMO project label.
[01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:42.112]  They also have an app you can download that makes it really easy to go shopping.
[01:17:42.112 --> 01:17:52.240]  So this is the power of voting with your dollars, pushing back against these corporations who see us as just a science experiment that's to be fed a steady stream of pesticides and frankenfoods.
[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:55.045]  We are not a science experiment.
[01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:57.970]  We are humans and we are reclaiming our power.
[01:17:57.970 --> 01:18:03.240]  And this glyphosate residue-free food label is just another victory for the consumer.
[01:18:09.122 --> 01:18:10.262]  That's a great report, Leanne.
[01:18:10.262 --> 01:18:15.204]  And the point that you made in that about the farmers in India, I think, is something that is really important.
[01:18:15.204 --> 01:18:24.547]  That people don't realize the insidious business plan of Monsanto to essentially poison the ground for other crops.
[01:18:24.547 --> 01:18:26.728]  You can't grow other seeds other than theirs.
[01:18:26.728 --> 01:18:35.771]  And to genetically engineer seeds that cannot reproduce themselves so that these people then have to buy these seeds from, once they poison their field,
[01:18:36.731 --> 01:18:38.812]  By using Monsanto on it.
[01:18:38.812 --> 01:18:48.195]  They say, well, look, you know, we're going to give you these crops and if you use glyphosate on it, then it'll get rid of the weeds, but it won't kill our crops.
[01:18:48.195 --> 01:18:55.137]  But then they poison their land and then they can't even regrow the crops that they bought, the seed that they bought from Monsanto.
[01:18:55.137 --> 01:18:57.658]  So now they're in debt to the company store.
[01:18:58.319 --> 01:19:00.262]  They load 16 tons and what do they get?
[01:19:00.262 --> 01:19:07.514]  Another day older and deeper in debt and they get to the point where it becomes so egregious that massive numbers of them are committing suicide.
[01:19:07.514 --> 01:19:10.539]  This is the evil of this corporation that we're seeing here.
[01:19:11.547 --> 01:19:29.410]  Right, and of course to sell this as the miracle seed that are going to save the planet and be drought resistant and that all of these farmers are going to be lifted out of poverty because they're going to be able to pull in such massive amount of money with these miracle crops and it's all a crock, basically.
[01:19:29.410 --> 01:19:39.172]  So we have many activists there, especially in India, working on behalf of these people to push back against them going in debt to the bank.
[01:19:39.172 --> 01:19:40.712]  The only thing they have is their land.
[01:19:41.932 --> 01:19:42.853]  Yes.
[01:19:42.853 --> 01:19:45.994]  And that's the core thing that we see here.
[01:19:45.994 --> 01:19:49.775]  We've seen it from the IMF, but we see this from all these monopoly capitalists.
[01:19:49.775 --> 01:19:53.036]  Whether it's the people who want to control our transportation, or the people who want to control our food.
[01:19:53.036 --> 01:19:54.737]  They want to own everything.
[01:19:54.737 --> 01:19:56.778]  They want to turn you into a renter.
[01:19:56.778 --> 01:19:59.659]  Even if you're a farmer, you've got to rent your seeds from them.
[01:19:59.659 --> 01:20:01.039]  That's the way these people roll.
[01:20:01.039 --> 01:20:01.839]  They want to own everything.
[01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:02.420]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.761]  Get back to nature.

[01:21:00.925 --> 01:21:02.886]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:21:02.886 --> 01:21:08.210]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:21:08.210 --> 01:21:09.792]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:21:09.792 --> 01:21:18.138]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:21:25.824 --> 01:21:28.086]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:21:28.086 --> 01:21:32.510]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:34.692]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.603]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:18.603 --> 01:24:22.325]  I'm David Knight with Leanne McAdoo joining us from Florida via Skype.
[01:24:22.325 --> 01:24:23.926]  We're going to go back to Leanne in just a moment.
[01:24:23.926 --> 01:24:37.813]  I want to remind you before we do, we've been talking about glyphosate and the new ability that you have when you go to the grocery store to not only find out if something is non-GMO, but you can also find out if it has glyphosate content in it.
[01:24:37.813 --> 01:24:40.595]  And you'd be surprised at how pervasive
[01:24:41.315 --> 01:24:41.535]  I think?
[01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:00.794]  First, quality products that we sell.
[01:25:00.794 --> 01:25:04.195]  That's how we support this organization here at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:25:04.195 --> 01:25:07.596]  We have a massive July summer special.

[01:25:31.884 --> 01:25:36.305]  So you want to make sure that you have that vital nutrient in your diet.

[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:16.775]  Get serious about eliminating contaminants in your life.
[01:26:16.775 --> 01:26:17.759]  Things that you have...

[01:26:24.195 --> 01:26:28.037]  We have the all-new MycoZx Fungus and Yeast Cleanser.

[01:26:41.463 --> 01:26:43.744]  So take a look at the products that we sell at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:26:43.744 --> 01:26:44.024]  Remember,
[01:26:44.364 --> 01:26:46.566]  Free shipping for the month of July.
[01:26:46.566 --> 01:26:52.030]  Massive discounts from 30 to 40 percent off our most popular products.
[01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:53.591]  All right, let's go back to Leanne.
[01:26:53.591 --> 01:27:01.917]  Leanne, we have an interesting poll that came out today saying that Melania Trump is more popular than first lady Hillary Clinton was.
[01:27:01.917 --> 01:27:09.002]  I don't really find that surprising because you know it was Hillary Clinton who took it upon herself to try to nationalize health care.
[01:27:09.622 --> 01:27:09.942]  We're good.
[01:27:29.531 --> 01:27:31.751]  It was the other way around.
[01:27:31.751 --> 01:27:34.892]  Bill Clinton was more popular than Hillary Clinton.
[01:27:34.892 --> 01:27:39.073]  And Melania is way more popular than Hillary Clinton was.
[01:27:39.073 --> 01:27:42.974]  And she's had her popularity going up, which is not surprising.
[01:27:42.974 --> 01:27:54.976]  But I think this is, we had a poll earlier this week, Leanne, where Democrats thought that Hillary Clinton only had a 4%, only 4% of Democrats believed that she could beat Donald Trump.
[01:27:55.656 --> 01:27:57.579]  In a matchup again.
[01:27:57.579 --> 01:27:58.961]  That's the essence of this.
[01:27:58.961 --> 01:28:06.330]  That's why they're coming up with this ridiculous Russian narrative that we're going to talk about in the next section is because people dislike her so much.
[01:28:07.287 --> 01:28:07.507]  Yeah.
[01:28:37.348 --> 01:28:40.491]  She always saw herself as an Eleanor Roosevelt.
[01:28:40.491 --> 01:28:45.714]  As a matter of fact, she was channeling Eleanor Roosevelt in seances in the White House.
[01:28:45.714 --> 01:28:56.963]  I mean, she saw herself as somebody who was going to be this great socialist, or they like to call themselves progressive, this great socialist campaigner, as Eleanor Roosevelt was.
[01:28:56.963 --> 01:28:59.965]  And it was absolutely amazing to all of us.
[01:28:59.965 --> 01:29:05.109]  You know, they want to talk about Jared Kushner and the involvement of the Trumps in the White House and everything.
[01:29:05.609 --> 01:29:14.213]  But they weren't complaining about nepotism when the first lady decided that she was going to take over this massive sector of the economy.
[01:29:14.213 --> 01:29:16.974]  Far more intrusive, even, than Obamacare.
[01:29:16.974 --> 01:29:22.356]  Even Hillary Clinton and Pelosi came back and said, well, you know, let's not try that again.
[01:29:22.356 --> 01:29:24.036]  Let's do it incrementally.
[01:29:24.036 --> 01:29:26.057]  That's the way that we can take this over.
[01:29:26.057 --> 01:29:27.998]  And that's really what Obamacare is.
[01:29:27.998 --> 01:29:35.401]  It's a first step in an incremental takeover to get us back to what Hillary Clinton tried to do as first lady when she was first elected.
[01:29:35.781 --> 01:29:39.684]  When we come back, we're going to talk to Leanne McAdoo about the election.
[01:29:39.684 --> 01:29:41.926]  Like I call it, elect-spionage.
[01:29:41.926 --> 01:29:47.329]  Because we have the spy agencies in America getting involved hacking our election.
[01:29:47.329 --> 01:29:50.131]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.131 --> 01:29:51.532]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.532 --> 01:29:54.054]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.054 --> 01:29:56.756]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.365 --> 01:30:08.351]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[01:30:08.351 --> 01:30:13.856]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[01:30:13.856 --> 01:30:17.179]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[01:30:17.179 --> 01:30:19.541]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[01:30:19.541 --> 01:30:24.885]  And how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the individual?
[01:30:24.885 --> 01:30:26.487]  That is the ultimate concern.
[01:30:26.707 --> 01:30:32.892]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[01:30:32.892 --> 01:30:35.374]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[01:30:35.374 --> 01:30:43.981]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power, but as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[01:30:44.421 --> 01:30:49.807]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[01:30:49.807 --> 01:30:55.172]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[01:30:55.172 --> 01:30:58.616]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[01:31:01.701 --> 01:31:06.942]  Protect your skin with SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion by Emrix Essentials.

[01:32:07.659 --> 01:32:09.360]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.

[01:32:11.802 --> 01:32:13.003]  It's been sold out for months.
[01:32:13.003 --> 01:32:13.884]  Big waiting list.
[01:32:13.884 --> 01:32:17.727]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[01:32:17.727 --> 01:32:19.368]  Nobody's got something this good.

[01:32:29.676 --> 01:32:48.049]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's-type stuff that didn't exist 50 years ago.
[01:32:48.049 --> 01:32:48.629]  Now it's epidemic.
[01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:51.592]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them.
[01:32:51.592 --> 01:32:53.993]  Because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[01:32:53.993 --> 01:32:57.035]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or AAA2533139.
[01:33:08.507 --> 01:33:10.770]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[01:33:10.770 --> 01:33:17.039]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.039 --> 01:33:19.823]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[01:33:21.983 --> 01:33:28.405]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, and that's appropriate bumper music, Mission Impossible, because we're talking about electspionage.
[01:33:28.405 --> 01:33:37.267]  That is the manipulation of our election by our intelligence community, by our law enforcement community, by people who are foreign spies.
[01:33:37.267 --> 01:33:42.249]  Christopher Steele working for MI5, Fusion GPS, a Russian
[01:33:44.389 --> 01:33:45.610]  Front organization.
[01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:54.771]  They put together the Dirty Dossier, they came after Carter Page, and now this is their third bite of the apple coming after Donald Trump Jr.
[01:33:54.771 --> 01:33:57.452]  This is a very dangerous situation that we have here.
[01:33:57.452 --> 01:34:04.113]  This is far more dangerous than anything that Russia could do, what our own intelligence agency could do to us.
[01:34:04.113 --> 01:34:06.954]  And even people like Lindsey Graham are starting to get cold feet about it.
[01:34:07.654 --> 01:34:10.595]  I guess Lindsey's wondering what they've got on him.
[01:34:10.595 --> 01:34:14.597]  He was actually asking them when they were going for their reauthorization.
[01:34:14.597 --> 01:34:19.178]  They supposedly have to reauthorize this ability to eavesdrop.
[01:34:19.178 --> 01:34:22.660]  And of course they did that in a way that violated even that law.
[01:34:23.516 --> 01:34:29.418]  Uh, that I think, uh, stretches the Bill of Rights beyond the breaking point, in my opinion.
[01:34:29.418 --> 01:34:41.103]  But with the FISA court coming out and saying they violated the law, and Lindsey Graham asking them when they looked for the reauthorization of that section of the Patriot Act, he said, uh, you collecting information on me?
[01:34:42.143 --> 01:34:43.784]  Well, we can't tell you, Senator.
[01:34:43.784 --> 01:34:46.325]  If we told you, we'd have to kill your privacy.
[01:34:46.325 --> 01:34:48.466]  It's like, if I told you this, we'd have to kill you.
[01:34:48.466 --> 01:34:49.587]  That type of thing.
[01:34:49.587 --> 01:34:54.590]  They need to understand that they are the prime targets of this.
[01:34:54.590 --> 01:34:56.651]  We've said this from the very beginning.
[01:34:56.651 --> 01:35:02.654]  If the people in Washington are not already too far compromised with their secret lives,
[01:35:03.374 --> 01:35:08.476]  They better get rid of this stuff, but it may be too late, based on the crowd that we've got in Washington.
[01:35:08.476 --> 01:35:18.279]  I want to play and get Leanne's comments on this back and forth that Tucker Carlson had with someone on, with a, let's see, this is a...
[01:35:19.679 --> 01:35:22.622]  This is a Democrat congressman, I believe, or congressperson.
[01:35:22.622 --> 01:35:25.264]  Anyway, we'll find out who it is when we look at this clip.
[01:35:25.264 --> 01:35:30.569]  I was looking at the back and forth that they want to punish the Russians for having RT.
[01:35:30.569 --> 01:35:37.115]  This is very similar to what's going on right now with the Gulf states coming after Qatar saying, we want you to shut down Al Jazeera.
[01:35:37.876 --> 01:35:38.176]  Why?
[01:35:38.176 --> 01:35:43.819]  Because Al Jazeera has been critical of Saudi Arabia and some of these other states.
[01:35:43.819 --> 01:35:45.340]  So, that's what we're seeing now.
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:50.202]  We're seeing massive pressure being applied internationally to censor news media.
[01:35:50.202 --> 01:36:04.889]  That's why it's so important for you to stand with InfoWars to make sure that you don't give a monopoly of information back to CNN, back to ABC, NBC, CBS, those people who controlled all information in the United States prior to this.
[01:36:04.889 --> 01:36:06.390]  We don't want to go back to that situation.
[01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:17.857]  They're continually pushing on this and so here's a guy, here's somebody with Tucker Carlson pushing for Russians to be punished over having RT and I want to get Leanne's comments after we're finished with this.
[01:36:19.271 --> 01:36:21.513]  There's nothing we can do about it.
[01:36:21.513 --> 01:36:26.156]  Russian propaganda can do this, but what we can do is protect our democracy from it.
[01:36:26.156 --> 01:36:27.957]  How can we protect our democracy from RTs?
[01:36:27.957 --> 01:36:30.159]  We can punish the Russians for what they did.
[01:36:30.159 --> 01:36:30.919]  We can impose sanctions.
[01:36:30.919 --> 01:36:31.960]  For having a cable network here.
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:33.281]  No, no, it's not a cable network.
[01:36:33.281 --> 01:36:42.607]  It's Russian propaganda that promotes false information that gets reposted on the internet, shared with... What role does Larry King play in this?
[01:36:43.712 --> 01:36:44.272]  I have no idea.
[01:36:44.272 --> 01:36:45.913]  He's like one of the lead anchors there.
[01:36:45.913 --> 01:36:46.673]  Mike, is he?
[01:36:46.673 --> 01:36:48.094]  No, I'm sorry, I don't know about Larry King's show.
[01:36:48.094 --> 01:36:50.715]  Larry King's a Russian propagandist, is he?
[01:36:50.715 --> 01:36:53.516]  Which is a well-documented Russian propaganda operation.
[01:36:53.516 --> 01:36:55.737]  Are there any other news organizations that you think the U.S.
[01:36:55.737 --> 01:36:57.998]  Congress and the intelligence agencies ought to fight back against?
[01:36:57.998 --> 01:37:03.500]  No, what I think we ought to fight back against is foreign agents interfering with our presidential election.
[01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:04.861]  Look, here's the concern.
[01:37:04.861 --> 01:37:12.466]  We can't stop our team from existing, but we can punish the Russian government for having the audacity to interfere with our election.
[01:37:12.466 --> 01:37:14.148]  Name a story that ran on our TV.
[01:37:14.148 --> 01:37:22.214]  Well, there was a story about all of the money raised in the Clinton campaign, or by the Clinton Foundation, is used by the Clintons personally.
[01:37:22.214 --> 01:37:24.956]  The Clinton campaign is funded by the same sources.
[01:37:24.956 --> 01:37:27.357]  Alright, okay, this is a Democrat congressman.
[01:37:27.357 --> 01:37:30.740]  His name is Cicilline, I guess is the way you pronounce his name.
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:31.941]  I've never seen this guy before.
[01:37:32.561 --> 01:37:36.202]  But he is in the mainstream of the Democrat Party.
[01:37:36.202 --> 01:37:40.324]  If you can't defeat somebody's narrative, you try to censor them.
[01:37:40.324 --> 01:37:49.947]  So they're going to lock up or shut down Lionel, they're going to shut down Max Keiser, they're going to shut down Larry King, because they can't handle a free market in information.
[01:37:49.947 --> 01:37:51.768]  That's always the tactic they take.
[01:37:51.768 --> 01:37:57.650]  You know, Leanne, when they had the demonstrations here at this abortion clinic in Austin,
[01:37:58.790 --> 01:38:11.078]  And people were there with signs talking about what abortion really is and these counter protesters quote-unquote showed up and they just had blank black signs to put over other people's.
[01:38:11.078 --> 01:38:12.179]  They had nothing to say.
[01:38:12.179 --> 01:38:14.080]  It was simply censorship.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:22.846]  I thought that was one of the most incredible things I've ever seen because it was a physical demonstration of what has now become standard operating procedure for the Democrat Party.
[01:38:22.846 --> 01:38:23.506]  Censorship.
[01:38:23.506 --> 01:38:26.128]  They no longer support free speech in any way shape or form.
[01:38:26.894 --> 01:38:33.398]  Right, they're the only ones that are allowed to access the secret documents and then they'll tell you what you need to know.
[01:38:33.398 --> 01:38:39.101]  So we need to shut down CNN because they are just a propaganda channel for the Democrats.
[01:38:39.101 --> 01:38:41.743]  I mean, think we would have to shut down the BBC?
[01:38:41.743 --> 01:38:42.984]  It makes no sense.
[01:38:42.984 --> 01:38:51.569]  We know that maybe they're not funded directly by the government, but these are people who are definitely propaganda channels.
[01:38:51.789 --> 01:39:00.715]  Well it shows desperation because for the longest time we had, back when they just had the three channels or whatever, we had the CIA with Operation Mockingbird.
[01:39:00.715 --> 01:39:02.616]  People can look that up.
[01:39:02.616 --> 01:39:03.517]  It's a real thing.
[01:39:03.517 --> 01:39:04.938]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[01:39:04.938 --> 01:39:06.158]  It really happened.
[01:39:06.158 --> 01:39:07.039]  Operation Mockingbird
[01:39:07.219 --> 01:39:20.135]  Giving the talking points to the news media, telling them exactly what to say, and they would all just, in line, parrot back what the, as mockingbirds, they would parrot back what the CIA and the government had told them to say.
[01:39:20.135 --> 01:39:23.299]  And they're very upset about the fact that they've lost control of that.
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.522]  And that's why their only response is, we've got to find some way to shut down and control the internet.
[01:39:28.522 --> 01:39:29.762]  We've got to shut down Infowars.
[01:39:29.762 --> 01:39:30.962]  We've got to shut down Breitbart.
[01:39:30.962 --> 01:39:33.803]  We've got to get the FEC coming after them.
[01:39:33.803 --> 01:39:37.624]  They already tried and failed to do the FCC, but I'm sure they'll come back.
[01:39:37.624 --> 01:39:40.185]  Some Democrat commissioners on the FCC will try it as well.
[01:39:40.185 --> 01:39:44.147]  But they're going to try every trick in the book to shut people down.
[01:39:44.147 --> 01:39:48.808]  And they're not trying to hide the fact that they openly want to censor everyone and everything.
[01:39:48.808 --> 01:39:51.449]  The internet and entire news media organizations.
[01:39:52.492 --> 01:40:06.691]  Right, and we see these intelligence agents are still infiltrating the media to push their agenda by leaking all of these stories, anonymous sources that feed the media, the secret ledger or the secret dossier and all of these...
[01:40:07.452 --> 01:40:07.672]  I think
[01:40:30.027 --> 01:40:34.589]  What they want to believe, what they want to hear, then they're going to accept it as the truth.
[01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:38.111]  They don't need you to provide any evidence.
[01:40:38.111 --> 01:40:40.011]  You've confirmed their bias.
[01:40:40.011 --> 01:40:44.733]  A good example of that broke today, because we had this story about Donald Trump Jr.
[01:40:44.733 --> 01:40:45.113]  now.
[01:40:45.113 --> 01:40:48.435]  This is about day number five, I think, where they're putting this out.
[01:40:48.435 --> 01:40:51.936]  And so now NBC has dropped a new bombshell, they said.
[01:40:51.936 --> 01:40:57.519]  It's like, look, we have a former Soviet intelligence officer attended the meeting with Donald Trump Jr.
[01:40:58.399 --> 01:41:01.963]  But Zero Hedge reports, ah, but there's a catch.
[01:41:01.963 --> 01:41:08.631]  They say that this is a bombshell, but actually this information has already been reported by the New York Times last week.
[01:41:08.631 --> 01:41:10.333]  So this isn't a new revelation.
[01:41:10.333 --> 01:41:13.797]  They're just dripping this out to try to keep this story going.
[01:41:13.797 --> 01:41:14.759]  And who is this guy?
[01:41:15.299 --> 01:41:21.782]  Well, he was a Soviet-born counterintelligence officer, but he immigrated to the United States quite some time ago.
[01:41:21.782 --> 01:41:26.785]  He is now an American lobbyist, and he holds dual citizenship in the United States.
[01:41:26.785 --> 01:41:44.674]  And they point out, ironically, we're just spitballing here, so don't hold us to it, but maybe, just maybe, this is Zero Hedge writing, bringing a lobbyist to a meeting in which your intent is to lobby for the overturn of the Magnitsky Act might just be something that makes sense, rather than being part of a larger plot
[01:41:45.094 --> 01:41:45.555]  We're good.
[01:42:03.755 --> 01:42:06.638]  We see the dirty dossier stuff coming from Fusion GPS.
[01:42:06.638 --> 01:42:10.482]  We see John McCain shopping this dirty dossier around.
[01:42:10.482 --> 01:42:12.404]  We see the attacks on Carter Page.
[01:42:12.404 --> 01:42:14.466]  All this stuff, nothing has come of it.
[01:42:14.466 --> 01:42:15.627]  It has all collapsed.
[01:42:15.627 --> 01:42:19.912]  But as soon as one of these things falls down, they bring up the next one.
[01:42:19.912 --> 01:42:22.615]  Which just shows that they don't have anything.
[01:42:22.615 --> 01:42:25.758]  That none of these things have stuck, but they keep bringing more and more of them up.
[01:42:26.977 --> 01:42:37.411]  Right, David, the fact that they spent $1.6 billion trying to get Hillary Clinton elected, they weren't able to come up with any dirt on President Trump with all that money.
[01:42:37.411 --> 01:42:41.537]  So, I mean, that's pretty impressive that they still have come up with nothing.
[01:42:41.537 --> 01:42:44.220]  And I was quite surprised to see the establishment
[01:42:44.801 --> 01:42:46.863]  Trying to take these Donald Trump Jr.
[01:42:46.863 --> 01:42:54.670]  emails as the big evidence that they were finally looking for with this collusion with Russia, because that's a slippery slope.
[01:42:54.670 --> 01:43:03.378]  And that would start kind of peeling back the curtain to what do these campaigns, what do they engage in to get intel on their opponents?
[01:43:03.378 --> 01:43:06.882]  What sort of dirty tricks were the Democrats up to to get
[01:43:07.382 --> 01:43:12.105]  Hillary Clinton, who has very low poll ratings, no one likes her.
[01:43:12.105 --> 01:43:15.007]  What were they up to to try to get this woman elected?
[01:43:15.007 --> 01:43:35.441]  And as we see, you know, you poke that hornet's nest, people are saying, well, look what John McCain, he was so excited to get some opposition intelligence against Trump that he dispatched an aide to go collect this dirty dossier so that he could then provide it to the FBI and circulate it around the White House.
[01:43:35.441 --> 01:43:36.802]  So they could try to hire this guy?
[01:43:37.902 --> 01:43:42.104]  And the FBI, meanwhile, takes another Democrat contractor, CrowdStrike.
[01:43:42.104 --> 01:43:45.166]  They say, well, you say that the Russians hacked your server?
[01:43:45.166 --> 01:43:45.606]  Oh, really?
[01:43:45.606 --> 01:43:46.046]  They did?
[01:43:46.046 --> 01:43:48.167]  OK, well, we'll take your word for it.
[01:43:48.167 --> 01:43:49.448]  Could we see those servers?
[01:43:49.448 --> 01:43:51.209]  Oh, no, you're not going to show those servers to us?
[01:43:51.209 --> 01:43:52.209]  OK, that's all right.
[01:43:52.209 --> 01:43:52.909]  We're the FBI.
[01:43:52.909 --> 01:43:54.030]  We won't bother with that.
[01:43:54.030 --> 01:43:56.951]  We'll just go away and take your word for it.
[01:43:56.951 --> 01:43:58.172]  And that's what is happening.
[01:43:58.172 --> 01:44:00.333]  So then they take the CrowdStrike narrative
[01:44:01.013 --> 01:44:18.525]  And they have a hand-picked panel of sycophants come before Clappers, the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence, and so they have this hand-picked panel of people from the FBI, the NSA, and the CIA come in, and he says, well, nobody objected when we gave them this report from CrowdStrike, so...
[01:44:19.125 --> 01:44:22.769]  Everybody agrees, and that's where we get the 17 intelligence agencies.
[01:44:22.769 --> 01:44:32.939]  The phrase came from Hillary Clinton and these people parodied it, parodied it throughout the election, which I think basically says that they violated the Hatch Act.
[01:44:32.939 --> 01:44:33.779]  They were obviously
[01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:40.705]  In office, campaigning for Hillary Clinton, pushing this narrative along with many other things that they were doing.
[01:44:40.705 --> 01:44:51.494]  That's the thing that's very concerning, is how the intelligence and law enforcement community violated the Hatch Act, interfered in our elections, and violated their own laws as pointed out by the FISA court itself.
[01:44:52.807 --> 01:44:56.291]  Well, David, I mean, we know that they're very good at regime change.
[01:44:56.291 --> 01:45:10.866]  We've seen it happening all over the world to foment civil unrest and delegitimize their elected representatives, to throw them out so that they could install their deep state puppets in all of these other
[01:45:11.627 --> 01:45:14.590]  Countries where they want to push for this globalism.
[01:45:14.590 --> 01:45:35.429]  We haven't really had to see that here They haven't had to push for regime change here in the United States because they were always able to get their agent installed But they can't do that now with President Trump and that's why we're actually seeing People who need to be investigated for treason here in our country who are actively working to overthrow our president
[01:45:35.769 --> 01:45:52.160]  President Trump needs to take the power and the ability that he has right now to investigate people like George Soros, who are actively supporting protests and paying for protests with some of his NGOs and organizations, not just in the United States, but other countries as well.
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:57.884]  We've seen that he's been very successful in other countries like the Ukraine, for instance, they were able to delegitimize
[01:45:58.564 --> 01:45:59.085]  I don't know.
[01:46:13.724 --> 01:46:14.065]  Exactly.
[01:46:14.065 --> 01:46:20.090]  I have George Soros organizing the overthrow of the government in Ukraine and working with the State Department.
[01:46:20.090 --> 01:46:24.274]  We have the quotes of the talking about how they contributed money to that.
[01:46:24.274 --> 01:46:33.944]  And then they come around and the Democrats are working with the Ukrainians in order to try to get opposition research on Paul Manafort and others to try to take down the Trump campaign.
[01:46:33.944 --> 01:46:36.526]  So they've done what they're accusing
[01:46:37.307 --> 01:46:38.908]  Donald Trump Jr.
[01:46:38.908 --> 01:46:58.561]  and the Trump campaign of doing which they actually didn't do they did they walked out of the meeting with this woman they didn't get any information but the Democrats spent a lot of money and did get a lot of information and they overthrew other governments and now they're trying to overthrow our government and that's the thing that people really need to pay attention to and it's one of the things that
[01:46:59.602 --> 01:47:15.294]  Trump's Justice Department needs to get serious about prosecuting these people who have violated the law, who have used their office in violation of the Hatch Act and in other ways violated laws by exposing people, by spying on people without a warrant, without a search warrant.
[01:47:15.294 --> 01:47:17.856]  The FISA court has pointed out how they broke the law.
[01:47:17.856 --> 01:47:19.717]  We need to do something about that.
[01:47:19.717 --> 01:47:26.442]  We can't allow people like Comey and McCabe to stay in office to escape punishment and Hillary Clinton.
[01:47:26.442 --> 01:47:27.723]  Let's not forget Hillary Clinton.
[01:47:28.463 --> 01:47:30.584]  Let's, uh, Hillary for prison.
[01:47:30.584 --> 01:47:32.485]  I mean, that has to happen.
[01:47:32.485 --> 01:47:34.766]  We have to have some kind of prosecution of these people.
[01:47:34.766 --> 01:47:38.988]  They cannot be above the law, especially with the criminal actions that they're doing.
[01:47:38.988 --> 01:47:50.673]  The longer they let this go, the more they're going to turn our country into a third world, kind of a East German Stasi state, which is really what we're looking at now with our law enforcement intelligence agencies.
[01:47:52.029 --> 01:47:52.930]  You're absolutely right.
[01:47:52.930 --> 01:47:54.651]  It is projection.
[01:47:54.651 --> 01:47:56.812]  And they are trying to say that Donald Trump Jr.
[01:47:56.812 --> 01:48:00.294]  doxxed himself because he released these emails.
[01:48:00.294 --> 01:48:08.279]  That to me is something that an innocent person would do, who would say, look, here it is, here are my emails.
[01:48:08.279 --> 01:48:13.542]  They wouldn't delete them and then use BleachBit to wipe their server just for good measure.
[01:48:13.942 --> 01:48:14.482]  That's right.
[01:48:14.482 --> 01:48:14.722]  Yeah.
[01:48:14.722 --> 01:48:19.324]  If you're in business, what is a good practice of somebody in business?
[01:48:19.324 --> 01:48:23.265]  If something happens, you do full disclosure and you do it right away.
[01:48:23.265 --> 01:48:24.746]  That's not the way the politicians play it.
[01:48:24.746 --> 01:48:28.067]  They like to hold on to this stuff to the very last minute.
[01:48:28.067 --> 01:48:31.348]  They like to fight you every inch of the way.
[01:48:31.348 --> 01:48:33.749]  But he's just doing what a person in business would do.
[01:48:33.749 --> 01:48:36.730]  He's doing what an innocent person would do and say, look, here it is.
[01:48:36.730 --> 01:48:37.691]  Look, there's nothing here.
[01:48:38.251 --> 01:48:40.032]  And there isn't anything there.
[01:48:40.032 --> 01:48:42.734]  And yet it's this constant drip, drip, drip.
[01:48:42.734 --> 01:48:48.197]  Just like they're saying, oh look, now we found out that there was a guy who was a former Russian agent who was at this meeting.
[01:48:48.197 --> 01:48:54.902]  And he's lived here for a long time and he's been lobbying people all over Washington, as has this Russian lawyer.
[01:48:55.582 --> 01:49:02.128]  There was a report from the Daily Caller talking about all the different people that she's had a relationship to.
[01:49:02.128 --> 01:49:07.493]  According to the Washington Post, she worked for years with Glenn Simpson, the founder of Fusion GPS.
[01:49:07.493 --> 01:49:13.318]  She's met and lobbied California Representative Ron Dellums as a hired lobbyist, okay?
[01:49:13.738 --> 01:49:18.902]  So she's worked with people that are involved in the California government, Jerry Brown and others.
[01:49:18.902 --> 01:49:23.226]  She was given the visa to come in.
[01:49:23.226 --> 01:49:29.771]  She was denied a visa and then they gave her an exception and she stayed beyond the point at which she was supposed to go back.
[01:49:29.771 --> 01:49:33.815]  So she's actually here illegally at the time she had the meeting.
[01:49:33.815 --> 01:49:41.041]  And then a couple of days later, she is there in a congressional hearing behind a former ambassador to Russia.
[01:49:42.162 --> 01:49:43.804]  Always with the Democrats.
[01:49:43.804 --> 01:49:47.867]  This woman is a Democrat operative, and that's the key thing.
[01:49:47.867 --> 01:49:48.868]  It was a setup.
[01:49:48.868 --> 01:49:53.151]  It was a trap to make him guilty, not even by association.
[01:49:53.151 --> 01:49:58.216]  They didn't really even associate with these people, but just guilty by his own proximity to this person.
[01:49:59.448 --> 01:50:04.689]  Well and it's just interesting that we have the establishment media won't follow that story.
[01:50:04.689 --> 01:50:16.991]  They won't follow that paper trail that continues to lead back to the Democrats to their own corruption and collusion with the media establishment as well colluding to try to get Hillary Clinton.
[01:50:16.991 --> 01:50:19.872]  It all circles back to them again and again and again.
[01:50:19.872 --> 01:50:26.233]  The only corruption that has been exposed here is on the side of the Democrats and it's incredible
[01:50:26.813 --> 01:50:37.610]  To see how our free and independent press refuses to actually go there to follow the money and to report the news to the American people.
[01:50:37.610 --> 01:50:39.973]  The news that we can actually use to stay free.
[01:50:41.232 --> 01:50:42.354]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:42.354 --> 01:50:46.019]  Let's take a look at what's happening with other news.
[01:50:46.019 --> 01:50:49.604]  We've got a guy who was investigating Clinton's emails.
[01:50:49.604 --> 01:50:51.948]  Somehow, looks like he had maybe a Clinton side.
[01:50:51.948 --> 01:50:55.553]  We're going to take a look at that and other suicide associated with the Clintons.
[01:50:55.553 --> 01:50:57.075]  We'll be right back with Leanne McAdoo.

[01:55:39.838 --> 01:55:48.824]  Now Leanne, we were talking in the last section about this lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya who has worked for the Democrats for a very long time.
[01:55:48.824 --> 01:55:49.145]  We had
[01:55:50.182 --> 01:56:03.788]  Breitbart, Daily Caller News, put together essentially a long list of people that she's worked with, Democrats, people like Ron Dellums, Jerry Brown, Howard Dean, Joe Trippi, via a Democrat lobbyist that she was working with.
[01:56:03.788 --> 01:56:06.910]  Loretta Lynch, let her in the country, made exceptions for her.
[01:56:07.670 --> 01:56:10.772]  She was in John McCain's office back in 2015.
[01:56:10.772 --> 01:56:16.355]  We see from her Twitter account that she opposed Donald Trump vociferously on multiple occasions.
[01:56:16.355 --> 01:56:20.178]  She also supported Hillary over Bernie Sanders.
[01:56:20.178 --> 01:56:22.319]  And she's worked with Fusion GPS.
[01:56:22.319 --> 01:56:25.381]  And now we have Fusion GPS's boss
[01:56:26.101 --> 01:56:26.641]  I don't know.
[01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:47.452]  No, we're not going to show the FBI the servers.
[01:56:47.452 --> 01:56:49.213]  They're going to just take our word for it.
[01:56:49.213 --> 01:56:53.016]  Meanwhile, we've got people like Roger Stone begging to clear his name.
[01:56:53.016 --> 01:56:59.962]  People like Carter Page begging to clear his name before these committees in Congress, and they won't let them do it.
[01:56:59.962 --> 01:57:02.063]  But the Democrats say, no, I'm not going to even come in.
[01:57:02.063 --> 01:57:03.384]  You can call me, but I'm not going to come in.
[01:57:03.384 --> 01:57:04.045]  Isn't that amazing?
[01:57:04.901 --> 01:57:05.601]  Yeah.
[01:57:05.601 --> 01:57:10.543]  They must be guilty because they want to speak publicly and clear their name.
[01:57:10.543 --> 01:57:16.606]  Whereas other people who want to actually bleach with their computers, they get to go run to be the president.
[01:57:16.606 --> 01:57:17.266]  It's incredible.
[01:57:17.266 --> 01:57:18.347]  We live in Wally World.
[01:57:18.347 --> 01:57:21.188]  It's what we were talking about, about Donald Trump Jr.
[01:57:21.188 --> 01:57:22.469]  saying, OK, here's the emails.
[01:57:22.469 --> 01:57:23.409]  You think there's something here?
[01:57:23.409 --> 01:57:24.189]  There's nothing here.
[01:57:24.189 --> 01:57:24.850]  Here's the emails.
[01:57:24.850 --> 01:57:25.390]  Take a look at them.
[01:57:25.390 --> 01:57:27.491]  And now they try to make something out of that.
[01:57:28.271 --> 01:57:40.161]  Another thing that I think is interesting that broke today is an individual, a Republican donor, an operative from Chicago's North Shore, who said that he had tried to obtain Hillary Clinton's missing emails from Russian hackers.
[01:57:40.161 --> 01:57:49.188]  He killed himself, committed suicide, another Clinton side, in a Minnesota hotel room days after talking to the Wall Street Journal about his efforts.
[01:57:49.989 --> 01:57:51.070]  Uh, it's kind of interesting.
[01:57:51.070 --> 01:57:52.571]  They said that he committed suicide.
[01:57:52.571 --> 01:57:56.935]  He was found with a bag over his head and a source of helium attached.
[01:57:56.935 --> 01:57:58.897]  An odd way to commit suicide.
[01:57:58.897 --> 01:58:04.922]  But even stranger, Leanne, is the note that he left that said, no foul play here whatsoever.
[01:58:05.882 --> 01:58:09.084]  I mean, it's like, move along, there's nothing to see.
[01:58:09.084 --> 01:58:12.446]  Nobody writes a suicide note like that, and nobody says this.
[01:58:12.446 --> 01:58:18.029]  Nobody says, I'm doing this because I'm worried about my life insurance of five million dollars expiring.
[01:58:18.029 --> 01:58:21.551]  I mean, if you do that, then of course you're not going to get the life insurance.
[01:58:21.551 --> 01:58:23.892]  I mean, come on, this is absolutely amazing.
[01:58:24.732 --> 01:58:33.620]  We're out of time, but thank you for joining us Leanne McAdoo, who is now in Florida, and we're going to be joined by Owen Schroer in the next hour.
[01:58:33.620 --> 01:58:37.444]  Stay with us, I've got a news up break in just a minute.
[01:58:37.444 --> 01:58:42.848]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:42.848 --> 01:58:44.149]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[01:59:53.777 --> 01:59:56.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:12.268 --> 02:00:18.016]  Live from the InfoHorse.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:18.016 --> 02:00:21.401]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:21.401 --> 02:00:21.961]  I'm David Knight.
[02:00:21.961 --> 02:00:24.004]  In the next segment, we're going to be joined by Owen Schroer.
[02:00:24.838 --> 02:00:46.131]  We were talking earlier about Donald Trump's visit to Paris, meeting with the Sun King, Jupiter himself, Macron, who is pushing this climate deal that Trump wisely exited with the advice of his EPA pick and many other people who really understand what's going on with this.
[02:00:46.131 --> 02:00:48.072]  We have to get out of this.
[02:00:48.072 --> 02:00:48.673]  People who
[02:00:50.365 --> 02:00:55.427]  Even support the idea that we've got to eliminate carbon dioxide that is going to burn the planet up.
[02:00:55.427 --> 02:00:58.168]  They know that this isn't going to do anything towards it.
[02:00:58.168 --> 02:01:01.289]  All it is going to do is just harm our economy.
[02:01:01.289 --> 02:01:04.330]  And there was a story from WorldNetDaily earlier this week.
[02:01:04.330 --> 02:01:04.510]  U.S.
[02:01:04.510 --> 02:01:08.951]  cities and states who are in love with the Paris climate deal face a new hurdle.
[02:01:08.951 --> 02:01:11.752]  A lot of these people have said, we're going to stay in the climate deal.
[02:01:11.752 --> 02:01:13.392]  We don't care if Donald Trump gets us out.
[02:01:13.392 --> 02:01:16.754]  Well, actually, no, you don't have a say in that.
[02:01:16.754 --> 02:01:17.814]  They say about a dozen states
[02:01:18.274 --> 02:01:28.961]  Including Washington, Oregon, California, Minnesota, Virginia, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, rebelled against President Trump when he withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord.
[02:01:28.961 --> 02:01:40.809]  And you know, it was interesting because earlier this week we had Turkey come out and say, we're going to get out of it as well because if the US isn't in there to give us money, then there's nothing in it for us to shut our economy down.
[02:01:41.229 --> 02:01:46.293]  We're going to shut our economy down, but we're going to get massive cash payments from the United States.
[02:01:46.293 --> 02:01:59.603]  That only highlights what a horrendous deal this is for the United States, because we have to shut down our economy, and we have to do it at an earlier date than the so-called developing nations, but then we have to compensate them as well.
[02:01:59.603 --> 02:02:06.828]  So we shut down our economy and send massive amounts of money to these other countries, but more specifically, it's going to go to the leaders of those countries.
[02:02:06.828 --> 02:02:09.170]  That's the way foreign aid works, don't you understand?
[02:02:09.170 --> 02:02:10.251]  You've seen that before.
[02:02:10.771 --> 02:02:12.272]  We all know how that works.
[02:02:12.272 --> 02:02:15.733]  We all know that the person who was going to get the money was Erdogan himself.
[02:02:15.733 --> 02:02:17.273]  It wasn't going to go to the Turkish people.
[02:02:17.273 --> 02:02:18.754]  It wasn't going to go to their economy.
[02:02:18.754 --> 02:02:20.114]  It was something that he was going to pocket.
[02:02:20.114 --> 02:02:22.515]  That's the way it happens in these third world countries.
[02:02:22.515 --> 02:02:29.138]  So some of the states have already formed the United States Climate Alliance to uphold the previous US commitment that
[02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:31.631]  It's not a commitment.
[02:02:31.631 --> 02:02:38.537]  Obama self-ratified it because he couldn't get Congress to sign on to the constitutional ratification process.
[02:02:38.537 --> 02:02:40.139]  So he just made it up.
[02:02:40.139 --> 02:02:42.982]  He and Kerry signed it and said, we're going to ratify it ourselves.
[02:02:42.982 --> 02:02:44.523]  No, it doesn't work.
[02:02:44.523 --> 02:02:51.370]  And he found out, as we all know, that if he comes in and just says, well, I'm going to do it by executive order, then Donald Trump comes in and says, well, I'm going to undo it.
[02:02:51.570 --> 02:02:52.410]  By executive order.
[02:02:52.410 --> 02:02:53.811]  It doesn't have any effect.
[02:02:53.811 --> 02:03:01.734]  They said there's also 267 mayors and governors who have signed an open letter to the international community and to other parties of the Paris Agreement.
[02:03:01.734 --> 02:03:03.635]  However, there is a problem.
[02:03:03.635 --> 02:03:07.536]  Congressional Research Service says the Constitution, remember that Constitution?
[02:03:07.536 --> 02:03:12.118]  That thing these guys swear to that we don't usually pay any attention to, but maybe they will now.
[02:03:12.118 --> 02:03:18.800]  It allows for federal law to preempt state and local law in a number of areas, including foreign policy.
[02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:20.781]  Yes, that is not their jurisdiction.
[02:03:21.201 --> 02:03:39.335]  And they point out this, they said, even when there is no actual conflict between state and federal law or policy, the Supreme Court has held that a state law can still be deemed an unconstitutional intrusion into the field of foreign affairs if it results in something more than an incidental or indirect effect on U.S.
[02:03:39.335 --> 02:03:40.416]  foreign relations.
[02:03:40.416 --> 02:03:42.398]  In other words, this is kind of like the Logan Act.
[02:03:43.131 --> 02:03:49.995]  Remember when we have Bilderberg and we say, we've got people that are engaging in setting U.S.
[02:03:49.995 --> 02:03:50.515]  policy.
[02:03:50.515 --> 02:03:57.539]  Actually, they're also doing something that is far worse, far more criminal than what Donald Trump Jr.
[02:03:57.539 --> 02:03:59.000]  was even ever accused of.
[02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:03.243]  We've got people who are at the highest level of multiple governments, meeting in private.
[02:04:03.243 --> 02:04:05.424]  Nobody is allowed to know what they're talking about.
[02:04:05.424 --> 02:04:06.685]  They show up, as we saw.
[02:04:07.605 --> 02:04:12.207]  Ed Ball from the UK shows up with a suitcase, not with clothes, filled with papers.
[02:04:12.207 --> 02:04:14.569]  They keep saying, oh, this is just a friendly meeting.
[02:04:14.569 --> 02:04:17.590]  He showed up with a suitcase filled with papers.
[02:04:17.590 --> 02:04:18.871]  We got it on film.
[02:04:18.871 --> 02:04:21.412]  My wife was there as an InfoWars reporter.
[02:04:21.412 --> 02:04:23.733]  Shot him as all this stuff fell out of his...
[02:04:23.953 --> 02:04:24.133]  I think?
[02:04:54.133 --> 02:04:55.314]  And the Constitution, I would add.
[02:04:55.314 --> 02:04:55.634]  Stay with us.
[02:04:55.634 --> 02:05:01.339]  We'll be right back with Orrin Shroyer.
[02:05:01.339 --> 02:05:02.900]  Duty, honor, country.
[02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:09.125]  Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be.
[02:05:09.125 --> 02:05:11.366]  They are your rallying points.
[02:05:11.366 --> 02:05:13.828]  To build courage when courage seems to fail.
[02:05:13.828 --> 02:05:17.371]  To regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith.
[02:05:17.371 --> 02:05:19.753]  To create hope when hope becomes forlorn.
[02:05:20.373 --> 02:05:29.325]  Unhappily, I possess neither that eloquence of dictation, that poetry of imagination, nor that brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean.
[02:05:29.325 --> 02:05:34.072]  The unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyant phrase.
[02:05:34.072 --> 02:05:35.734]  Every demagogue, every cynic,
[02:05:35.934 --> 02:05:45.718]  Every hypocrite, every troublemaker, and I am sorry to say some others of an entirely different character will try to downgrade them even to the extent of mockery and ridicule.
[02:05:45.718 --> 02:05:47.699]  But these are some of the things they do.
[02:05:47.699 --> 02:05:49.400]  They build your basic character.
[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:53.962]  They mold you for the future roles as the custodians of the nation's defense.
[02:05:53.962 --> 02:05:58.424]  This was said on May 12, 1962 by General Douglas MacArthur.
[02:05:58.424 --> 02:06:00.685]  I'm Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:06:00.965 --> 02:06:06.366]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:06:06.366 --> 02:06:09.207]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:06:09.207 --> 02:06:11.187]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:06:11.187 --> 02:06:16.208]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:06:16.208 --> 02:06:18.308]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:06:18.308 --> 02:06:19.588]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:06:19.588 --> 02:06:24.709]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:28.330]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[02:06:28.410 --> 02:06:31.592]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:06:31.592 --> 02:06:34.575]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:06:34.575 --> 02:06:38.278]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:06:38.278 --> 02:06:45.203]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:06:45.203 --> 02:06:52.709]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[02:06:52.709 --> 02:06:55.591]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste.
[02:06:59.713 --> 02:07:04.075]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[02:07:04.075 --> 02:07:08.276]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:07:08.276 --> 02:07:14.979]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[02:07:14.979 --> 02:07:18.741]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[02:07:19.441 --> 02:07:38.940]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:43.624]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[02:07:43.624 --> 02:07:54.854]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[02:07:54.854 --> 02:07:59.979]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[02:08:09.315 --> 02:08:10.556]  You found it.
[02:08:10.556 --> 02:08:12.597]  The tip of the spear.
[02:08:12.597 --> 02:08:16.981]  It is the Alex Jones Show with David Knight.
[02:08:19.651 --> 02:08:20.912]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:20.912 --> 02:08:29.139]  I'm David Knight and Owen Schroyer is joining me and he's got some breaking news about a corruption case that happened in New York State.
[02:08:29.139 --> 02:08:29.539]  Is that correct?
[02:08:29.539 --> 02:08:29.619]  Yes.
[02:08:29.619 --> 02:08:34.844]  It was an ex-Speaker of the House, a massive bribery case and we're going to take a look at some other
[02:08:35.524 --> 02:08:36.925]  Court cases that are coming up.
[02:08:36.925 --> 02:08:37.625]  Are we winning?
[02:08:37.625 --> 02:08:38.586]  Are we losing in the courts?
[02:08:38.586 --> 02:08:41.467]  Because this is where the Democrats want to fight us.
[02:08:41.467 --> 02:08:50.972]  And so we've got a new decision today from another judge trying to undermine Trump's travel ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court.
[02:08:50.972 --> 02:09:00.837]  It was shut down by local judges, by district judges, and now we've got another federal judge in Hawaii trying to expand the number of people who can be brought in.
[02:09:00.837 --> 02:09:03.558]  But let's take a look first at this corruption case that you've got here.
[02:09:03.558 --> 02:09:15.530]  Well, this is an amazing story, David, and this is the kind of thing that I think all Americans are frustrated with, whether you identify yourself as a Republican or Democrat or Independent, whatever, and that's people that are above the law.
[02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:19.835]  That's one of the biggest things we have with the beef with the way the Hillary Clinton email scandal was handled.
[02:09:19.835 --> 02:09:24.600]  I think that we've obviously got more developments on that with Peter Smith's alleged suicide.
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:26.141]  But if you flashback to
[02:09:27.162 --> 02:09:34.588]  November 2015, you would have heard the story about Sheldon Silver, found guilty on seven counts of corruption.
[02:09:34.588 --> 02:09:43.215]  This is a man who's taking millions of dollars in bribes, pay-for-play programs, typical of a Clinton crime syndicate that you would expect, and so he's guilty.
[02:09:43.215 --> 02:09:46.058]  He's sentenced to 12 years in jail.
[02:09:46.058 --> 02:09:48.860]  I think he was 72 when that conviction was settled.
[02:09:48.860 --> 02:09:52.103]  Well, yesterday, the decision got reversed.
[02:09:52.543 --> 02:09:55.467]  Sheldon Silver's corruption conviction is overturned.
[02:09:55.467 --> 02:09:59.953]  And the way they did this is actually shocking and it shows you how the Trump operates first.
[02:09:59.953 --> 02:10:07.402]  Ex-State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver's 2015 corruption was overturned by a Second Circuit Court of Appeals.
[02:10:07.402 --> 02:10:07.582]  Now...
[02:10:08.183 --> 02:10:14.749]  This is a conviction, again, $4 million in bribes in exchange for political power here that he was convicted on.
[02:10:14.749 --> 02:10:19.372]  This is a Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter appointed judge.
[02:10:19.372 --> 02:10:19.673]  Okay?
[02:10:19.673 --> 02:10:26.318]  This is a Democrat appointed judge who let this Democrat Clintonite walk.
[02:10:26.318 --> 02:10:26.839]  Okay?
[02:10:26.839 --> 02:10:30.422]  And the name of the judge is Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes.
[02:10:31.724 --> 02:10:44.809]  And the second court that he rules over said that the instructions given to jurors in Silver's case that defined an official auction were overbroad and that a properly instructed jury may not have found Silver guilty of corruption.
[02:10:44.809 --> 02:10:51.332]  So basically, what Jose Cabranes has said is that the judge is above the jury.
[02:10:51.952 --> 02:10:54.514]  That, oh, we don't agree with the jury's decision here.
[02:10:54.514 --> 02:10:55.354]  I'm the judge.
[02:10:55.354 --> 02:10:58.857]  I'm just going to go ahead and overrule that because, well, this is a Clintonite.
[02:10:58.857 --> 02:10:59.697]  This is a Democrat.
[02:10:59.697 --> 02:11:00.838]  This is one of us.
[02:11:00.838 --> 02:11:02.119]  So he gets to walk.
[02:11:02.119 --> 02:11:04.280]  And this is what Judge Cobrain said.
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:13.587]  We cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found Silver guilty if it had been properly instructed on the definition of an official act.
[02:11:13.587 --> 02:11:15.528]  So he doesn't like the jury's decision.
[02:11:15.528 --> 02:11:19.811]  So he goes, you guys are clearly irrational or misinformed, so I'm just going to overturn that conviction.
[02:11:20.111 --> 02:11:21.893]  It gets even worse though, David.
[02:11:21.893 --> 02:11:22.533]  It gets even worse.
[02:11:22.533 --> 02:11:30.380]  If you didn't think that was bad enough, in a similar case, Brooklyn Assemblyman William Boylan Jr.
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:33.642]  was convicted on the exact same grounds.
[02:11:33.642 --> 02:11:39.627]  So you've got two cases, same charges, different convictions, or different punishments.
[02:11:39.627 --> 02:11:40.268]  Why?
[02:11:40.268 --> 02:11:42.169]  Because some people are above the law.
[02:11:42.169 --> 02:11:46.393]  You play with the Clintons, you got blackmail with the Clintons, you're above the law.
[02:11:46.393 --> 02:11:48.534]  Now, Dean Scalos
[02:11:49.395 --> 02:11:49.495]  No.
[02:12:06.971 --> 02:12:07.491]  We're good to go.
[02:12:37.077 --> 02:12:42.680]  Well, it's very similar to what you were talking about before with Comey saying, you know, Hillary didn't have any intention.
[02:12:42.680 --> 02:12:44.541]  Well, that wasn't a part of the law.
[02:12:44.541 --> 02:12:45.622]  So we're going to let her go.
[02:12:45.622 --> 02:12:50.784]  And then they lock up a guy who takes pictures of where he was in his submarine.
[02:12:50.784 --> 02:12:55.187]  He clearly had no intention of doing anything, turning these over to the Russians.
[02:12:55.187 --> 02:12:59.029]  They were only up to the to the lowest level of confidential.
[02:12:59.829 --> 02:13:07.875]  We have multiple levels, confidential, secret, top secret, and then the kind of stuff that Hillary Clinton was involved in, which is above top secret.
[02:13:07.875 --> 02:13:11.277]  But of course, her releasing that information, no problem.
[02:13:11.277 --> 02:13:19.502]  But one guy takes three or four pictures of his bunk, or where he lived in the submarine to show his kids, later on his grandkids, he goes to jail.
[02:13:19.502 --> 02:13:23.365]  That's what we see, that double standard that is there, and that's what you're talking about here.
[02:13:23.365 --> 02:13:26.407]  The fact that the people at the top get off and everybody else goes to jail.
[02:13:26.527 --> 02:13:27.588]  Well, and here's the funny thing.
[02:13:27.588 --> 02:13:32.171]  I'm glad that you brought that up because they wanted to say that Hillary Clinton had no intent.
[02:13:32.171 --> 02:13:39.596]  Okay, well, if you get pulled over speeding and you say, well, officer, I had no intent to go 100 miles per hour.
[02:13:39.596 --> 02:13:41.297]  My car just happened to be a fast car.
[02:13:41.297 --> 02:13:42.478]  Yeah, that's not going to work.
[02:13:43.078 --> 02:13:45.599]  But that's basically what they're saying here for Silver.
[02:13:45.599 --> 02:13:55.182]  Another statement made from the judge, a rational jury might have concluded that Silver did not engage in an official act when he agreed to help Dr. Taub with permits for a charity race.
[02:13:55.182 --> 02:13:56.562]  So this is one of the cases.
[02:13:56.562 --> 02:13:58.303]  It's a cancer charity race.
[02:13:58.303 --> 02:13:59.283]  They raise a bunch of money.
[02:13:59.283 --> 02:14:01.224]  The race never happens.
[02:14:01.224 --> 02:14:07.006]  This doctor gets a bunch of people from the attorney's office who had the cancer to sue through his law firm.
[02:14:07.006 --> 02:14:09.266]  You know, millions of dollars, bribery, pay for play.
[02:14:09.266 --> 02:14:09.966]  It's all going on.
[02:14:09.966 --> 02:14:10.927]  The race never happens.
[02:14:11.987 --> 02:14:17.011]  And so the judge just says, well, Silver had no intent that the race was going to happen.
[02:14:17.011 --> 02:14:20.955]  We can't prove that he intended for that money to just fall into his lap.
[02:14:20.955 --> 02:14:23.337]  Yeah, he didn't intend for that.
[02:14:23.337 --> 02:14:30.783]  He meant to do something with it eventually, but it didn't happen so he just kept the money and he didn't return it to anybody and he didn't hold the race and he didn't give it to the victims.
[02:14:30.783 --> 02:14:38.369]  I'll tell you, if Dean Skelos, who is now pleading for the same case to overturn what would have been his conviction,
[02:14:39.390 --> 02:14:48.379]  Um, if he gets away with this, and I was the legal team of Assemblyman William Boylan Jr., I think my head would explode.
[02:14:48.379 --> 02:14:55.245]  Because you have two cases of the same thing, and two people that walk, and your client goes to jail.
[02:14:55.245 --> 02:14:55.806]  Something is wrong here.
[02:14:55.806 --> 02:15:00.831]  Well, just look at what's happening with the acting FBI director, McCabe, who was the number two for Comey.
[02:15:01.411 --> 02:15:08.715]  His wife was running for Senate in Virginia, and the Governor, Terry McAuliffe and Hillary Clinton's foundations were being investigated.
[02:15:08.715 --> 02:15:20.001]  He was also, he was investigating them at the time, he was investigating her for the email, her email classified stuff that we just said that Comey said, oh, we're going to let her off.
[02:15:20.001 --> 02:15:22.222]  As they were being investigated on this,
[02:15:23.102 --> 02:15:26.747]  Uh, his wife was running for office and they made donations to her.
[02:15:26.747 --> 02:15:32.373]  So this is something that is, uh, this is beyond just ethical violations that are happening here.
[02:15:32.373 --> 02:15:34.415]  This is a guy who's head of the FBI.
[02:15:34.415 --> 02:15:35.356]  So what are we going to do?
[02:15:35.356 --> 02:15:37.379]  The guy who is the governor in Virginia.
[02:15:37.779 --> 02:15:42.182]  A long-time political operative for the Clintons and the DNC, Terry McAuliffe.
[02:15:42.182 --> 02:15:47.446]  So this is something that is, we have rampant corruption from the top to the bottom.
[02:15:47.446 --> 02:15:48.487]  Something needs to be done about it.
[02:15:48.487 --> 02:15:50.889]  Here's another example of out-of-control courts.
[02:15:50.889 --> 02:15:57.353]  We had today a judge expanding, on his own, the list of relatives that have been exempted from the Trump travel ban.
[02:15:57.353 --> 02:16:02.317]  Remember we had all these activist judges and these district courts, federal district courts, saying, no, no, no.
[02:16:02.637 --> 02:16:09.521]  The president has no ability to set foreign policy or immigration policy or whatever, even though they allowed Obama to do that.
[02:16:09.521 --> 02:16:11.502]  No, when Trump does it, he can't do it.
[02:16:11.502 --> 02:16:14.323]  And so that was overruled by the Supreme Court.
[02:16:14.323 --> 02:16:18.545]  And now a federal judge in Hawaii on Thursday expanded the list of family relations.
[02:16:18.545 --> 02:16:29.231]  He said, no, you can't exclude grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-laws, sisters-in-laws, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins.
[02:16:30.311 --> 02:16:31.513]  It's the whole nine.
[02:16:31.513 --> 02:16:37.120]  It's like, so just gonna bring everybody in and say, oh yeah, I'm related to Mohammed over here.
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:38.722]  All the Mohammeds are related.
[02:16:38.722 --> 02:16:48.734]  So basically, there's another judge that's just come in with a trick to try to overturn the travel ban from countries that Obama was at war with.
[02:16:49.335 --> 02:16:52.898]  We're dropping bombs on these countries, presumably because they're dangerous.
[02:16:52.898 --> 02:17:00.484]  If they're not dangerous and we don't need to vet the people who are coming in from these countries and restrict it, then why are we dropping bombs on them?
[02:17:00.484 --> 02:17:07.530]  Another example of the corruption in the courts, Owen, is this is a judge that is hearing the case of the Center for Medical Progress.
[02:17:07.530 --> 02:17:14.976]  Remember, these are people who did the underground videos of Planned Parenthood and others talking about how they wanted to traffic in baby body parts.
[02:17:16.013 --> 02:17:32.098]  We have a district judge who has ruled against them, and he has now come after the lawyers defending this guy, holding them in contempt, because they pointed out that this judge has a conflict of interest.
[02:17:32.098 --> 02:17:39.680]  He served as a board member of Planned Parenthood's affiliated Wolford Family Clinic.
[02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:44.642]  So this is a judge who has been a board member of a Planned Parenthood clinic.
[02:17:45.422 --> 02:17:48.404]  And he doesn't recuse himself from this case.
[02:17:48.404 --> 02:17:51.567]  And the lawyers point that out, and they try to get him removed.
[02:17:51.567 --> 02:17:55.490]  Now he holds the lawyers in contempt of court.
[02:17:55.490 --> 02:17:57.791]  Contempt isn't a strong enough word, I think.
[02:17:57.791 --> 02:18:11.081]  You know, Chuck Grassley called out McCabe on the Hill, I think this was either yesterday or two days ago, saying, why didn't you recuse yourself from the Flynn investigation when you clearly had a personal vendetta against Flynn?
[02:18:11.081 --> 02:18:12.062]  This is the same thing.
[02:18:12.062 --> 02:18:13.223]  This is so obvious.
[02:18:14.991 --> 02:18:16.092]  I'm just so confused.
[02:18:16.092 --> 02:18:17.832]  You've got these liberal judges, David.
[02:18:17.832 --> 02:18:19.173]  They think they're above the law.
[02:18:19.173 --> 02:18:20.273]  They think they're above juries.
[02:18:20.273 --> 02:18:21.714]  They think they're above the people.
[02:18:21.714 --> 02:18:23.594]  So they step in.
[02:18:23.594 --> 02:18:25.355]  You just cited the case with this travel ban.
[02:18:25.355 --> 02:18:27.916]  So they step in and they take themselves above the law.
[02:18:27.916 --> 02:18:29.717]  They take themselves above whatever is the case.
[02:18:30.217 --> 02:18:32.440]  Where are the conservatives to do this?
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:38.208]  Where are the conservatives that are going to step in and put their foot down in the sand and say, enough!
[02:18:38.208 --> 02:18:39.510]  This is enough!
[02:18:39.510 --> 02:18:46.399]  There is clearly collusion between McCabe, I mean the Clintons, the Comeys, these judges that are overturning the travel ban, these judges that are setting silvers.
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:49.503]  When are we gonna have somebody take these people down?
[02:18:49.503 --> 02:18:51.065]  When is a conservative gonna step up?
[02:18:51.065 --> 02:18:53.768]  I mean, Chuck Grassley seems to be the only one doing it right now.
[02:18:53.768 --> 02:18:55.510]  I'd like to see Trey Gowdy go harder.
[02:18:55.510 --> 02:18:58.253]  Trump is trying to endear himself to the entire world right now.
[02:18:58.253 --> 02:19:00.836]  I mean, somebody has to step up and do something about this, David.
[02:19:00.836 --> 02:19:01.517]  I'm getting fed up.
[02:19:01.817 --> 02:19:04.739]  You mentioned McCabe and his conflict of interest with Flynn.
[02:19:04.739 --> 02:19:12.225]  He is under investigation three or four different cases because that was a situation of sexual harassment.
[02:19:12.225 --> 02:19:19.611]  Flynn got on his bad side by writing a letter of recommendation for the woman who he'd worked with for a very long time.
[02:19:19.611 --> 02:19:21.012]  And that's the kind of guy that Flynn is.
[02:19:21.192 --> 02:19:23.713]  If he sees something that is wrong, he will speak out.
[02:19:23.713 --> 02:19:25.953]  That's what got him fired from the Obama administration.
[02:19:25.953 --> 02:19:29.255]  He talked about how we were helping ISIS, so they got him out of there.
[02:19:29.255 --> 02:19:38.117]  Then he gets on the bad side of Andrew McCabe and the FBI because he defends a woman who was doing great work and all of a sudden gets shut down.
[02:19:38.117 --> 02:19:43.639]  When we come back, we're going to talk about why Trump has obstacles here in the courts.
[02:19:43.639 --> 02:19:46.220]  It's because they've been packed by Obama.
[02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:51.504]  And because these guys have lifetime appointments, like the Supreme Court.
[02:19:51.504 --> 02:19:54.007]  That's what needs to be changed if you really want to drain the swamp.
[02:19:54.007 --> 02:19:55.228]  Get rid of these lifetime appointments.
[02:19:55.228 --> 02:19:55.808]  Stay with us.
[02:19:55.808 --> 02:19:56.449]  We'll be right back.

[02:23:08.683 --> 02:23:17.028]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:23:17.028 --> 02:23:22.732]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[02:24:13.132 --> 02:24:14.413]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:14.413 --> 02:24:16.234]  I'm David Knight here with Owen Schroeder.
[02:24:16.234 --> 02:24:26.441]  Owen brought in the story about the judge who just overturned a jury conviction of corruption of the leader of the New York Assembly, it was, I think.
[02:24:26.441 --> 02:24:29.603]  It was a massive bribery and corruption charge and the judge says, well,
[02:24:30.383 --> 02:24:34.108]  I don't see how a jury could have convicted him unless they really didn't know what they're doing.
[02:24:34.108 --> 02:24:35.149]  So I'm just going to set that aside.
[02:24:35.149 --> 02:24:39.694]  And you know what's interesting about the rhetoric, and I know we need to move on here, but it's the same thing that Comey said.
[02:24:39.694 --> 02:24:40.735]  This is what the judge said.
[02:24:40.735 --> 02:24:41.876]  A rational jury.
[02:24:41.876 --> 02:24:43.237]  A rational jury.
[02:24:43.237 --> 02:24:44.259]  Remember what Comey said?
[02:24:44.259 --> 02:24:45.900]  No rational prosecutor.
[02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:49.104]  Yeah, that's how they rationalize their... Yeah, we're not rational.
[02:24:49.104 --> 02:24:50.185]  The people aren't allowed to be rational.
[02:24:50.365 --> 02:24:53.308]  We the people don't have the capacity to be rational anymore, David.
[02:24:53.308 --> 02:24:54.069]  That's what it is.
[02:24:54.069 --> 02:24:59.815]  So we've also had a judge who has overturned the Trump travel ban being reinstated by the Supreme Court.
[02:24:59.815 --> 02:25:03.520]  He comes back in and he says, oh, well, we're going to extend this from the immediate family.
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:09.206]  We're going to include in-laws and cousins and aunts and uncles and all this kind of stuff, broadening this.
[02:25:09.206 --> 02:25:10.367]  So what are we going to do about it?
[02:25:10.907 --> 02:25:11.968]  We're good to go.
[02:25:33.118 --> 02:25:40.504]  The courts that are very key in this, the Washington appeals court and two appellate courts that have been ruling against Trump's travel ban.
[02:25:40.504 --> 02:25:45.148]  Reuters points out it's going to be difficult for Donald Trump to do anything about that.
[02:25:45.148 --> 02:25:52.434]  He just had some conservative picks that he put into federal courts and so that's a win and Daily Caller reports on that.
[02:25:52.434 --> 02:25:53.495]  But are we winning or losing?
[02:25:53.835 --> 02:25:55.136]  What can we do about these courts?
[02:25:55.136 --> 02:26:08.548]  The problem is, this is Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, he said, Trump is not going to be able to make any significant dents into the Democrats' control of those three appellate courts, those appellate circuits.
[02:26:08.548 --> 02:26:11.191]  And it's not even that, it's much worse than that.
[02:26:11.191 --> 02:26:18.597]  They say after eight years in office, Obama was able to make enough appointments to leave a strong liberal imprint on the federal courts.
[02:26:18.597 --> 02:26:19.939]  When he left the White House in January,
[02:26:20.519 --> 02:26:26.382]  Nine of the 13 federal appellate courts had a majority of Democrats.
[02:26:26.382 --> 02:26:29.323]  So they have lifetime appointments.
[02:26:29.323 --> 02:26:34.385]  Today we had some conservative judges appointed by Trump and it was a victory.
[02:26:34.385 --> 02:26:45.130]  They said the Senate panel cleared several of President Trump's judicial nominees just hours before the White House announced its fifth slate of judicial candidates, but still in these key areas.
[02:26:45.130 --> 02:26:48.132]  So it's a win on one side, but on the other side
[02:26:48.832 --> 02:26:52.753]  Obama's got to block 9 out of the 13 appellate courts.
[02:26:52.753 --> 02:27:02.937]  So these appellate courts that can overturn this stuff, that can shut down and block what President Trump is doing, they have been packed by Obama and they have lifetime appointments for many of these people.
[02:27:02.937 --> 02:27:06.958]  Today we had conservative legal commentators, though, enthusiastically praising
[02:27:07.398 --> 02:27:14.700]  The picks that President Trump had, Newsom, Bush, Schiff as solid picks with excellent jurisprudential bona fides.
[02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:22.743]  I said thank you, President Trump, for keeping your campaign promise, continuing to pick excellent nominees, including those that were voted on today.
[02:27:22.743 --> 02:27:26.144]  That was the Council of the Conservative Judicial Crisis Network.
[02:27:26.144 --> 02:27:30.085]  So there's some progress that's being made, but it is really, really clogged.
[02:27:30.445 --> 02:27:35.868]  Obama was able to do all of this and get away with it because no media was going to report on it.
[02:27:35.868 --> 02:27:42.692]  Nobody was going to, you know, put out the stories that Obama was creating a judicial block here with all these judges that he appointed.
[02:27:42.692 --> 02:27:51.057]  But it's amazing to hear you break that down and it just makes me realize how the judiciary branch of the government does not represent the people whatsoever.
[02:27:51.417 --> 02:28:01.808]  It has zero representation of we the people, zero representation of the way the republic feels right now, and... We never vote for these people, they get appointed politically, just like the Supreme Court.
[02:28:01.808 --> 02:28:08.875]  We got nine political appointees there for life, we have absolutely nothing to say about it, and that happens all the way down the federal judiciary.
[02:28:09.435 --> 02:28:10.775]  And that's the key thing.
[02:28:10.775 --> 02:28:15.817]  Our elected representatives in Congress have basically abdicated everything that they do.
[02:28:15.817 --> 02:28:25.499]  They've abdicated it to the lobbyists who write the laws, to the bureaucracy that then extends those laws and enforces those laws, and to the courts.
[02:28:25.499 --> 02:28:28.720]  And they don't do any, our elected representatives don't do anything in Congress.
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:31.401]  It's all the courts and the bureaucracy that is doing this.
[02:28:31.641 --> 02:28:34.042]  Well, we all have bias, okay?
[02:28:34.042 --> 02:28:36.304]  And a judge, judiciary, there's always going to be some bias.
[02:28:36.304 --> 02:28:37.344]  It's just inherent.
[02:28:37.344 --> 02:28:39.285]  But here's the difference to me, David.
[02:28:39.285 --> 02:28:53.893]  When you put in a liberal judge, they go into that seat with a mindset, an agenda, a political agenda, an anti-American, because America's bad, and sexist, and racist, and now I'm a judge, now I can do something about it, now I can make a difference.
[02:28:53.893 --> 02:28:55.514]  That's the mindset that they go in with.
[02:28:55.954 --> 02:29:06.038]  Now, the conservative judge goes in, again, everybody's got their bias, but the mindset to me of a conservative judge is, okay, I need to take a look at how this relates to the Constitution.
[02:29:06.038 --> 02:29:11.080]  I need to think about what this means to the Republic, what this means to the Constitution, what this means to the future of this country.
[02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:13.620]  A totally different mindset, a totally different agenda.
[02:29:13.620 --> 02:29:20.403]  It's an agenda-driven judiciary branch versus a justice-driven judiciary branch, and it's clear what we have right now.
[02:29:20.523 --> 02:29:23.184]  What the liberals say is, we have a living Constitution.
[02:29:23.184 --> 02:29:25.005]  We have living documents.
[02:29:25.005 --> 02:29:26.826]  The written words don't mean anything.
[02:29:26.826 --> 02:29:34.090]  That was the big split between the people like Scalia, and hopefully his replacement, Neil Gorsuch, and the people on the left.
[02:29:34.090 --> 02:29:37.831]  The people on the left said, I'm just going to do whatever is in the best interest of the people.
[02:29:37.831 --> 02:29:39.072]  I don't really care what this says.
[02:29:39.072 --> 02:29:44.755]  Or even Justice Kennedy, who looks at foreign law to make his decision, not the Constitution.
[02:29:44.755 --> 02:29:45.035]  Stay with us.
[02:29:45.035 --> 02:29:46.296]  We'll be right back with Owen Schroer.
[02:29:46.296 --> 02:29:46.856]  I'm David Knight.
[02:29:50.205 --> 02:29:54.135]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.135 --> 02:29:56.821]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.428 --> 02:30:10.670]  The Constitutional Convention of 1787 was held in strict secrecy, and at the end of the proceedings, citizens gathered outside Independence Hall to learn what had been produced behind closed doors.
[02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:14.831]  While Benjamin Franklin was leaving the hall, a lady asked him, Well, Doctor, what have we got?
[02:30:14.831 --> 02:30:16.452]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:30:16.452 --> 02:30:19.392]  To which he responded, A republic, if you can keep it.
[02:30:19.392 --> 02:30:24.153]  But today, not only have we lost a republic, but most people don't even know what a republic even is.
[02:30:24.153 --> 02:30:26.694]  For one thing, a republic is not a democracy.
[02:30:26.894 --> 02:30:32.880]  A republic operates under the rule of law which protects individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority.
[02:30:32.880 --> 02:30:38.426]  Under a republic, the government and its citizens all abide by the same laws regardless of political power or lack thereof.
[02:30:38.426 --> 02:30:42.551]  Democracy, on the other hand, only leads to mob rule fueled by the unrestrained whims of the public.
[02:30:42.771 --> 02:30:49.459]  In a democracy, the individual or any groups of individuals composing the minority have no protection against the unlimited power of the majority.
[02:30:49.459 --> 02:30:51.361]  It is a case of majority over man.
[02:30:51.361 --> 02:30:54.945]  In other words, under a democracy, two wolves can vote to eat the sheep for dinner.
[02:30:54.945 --> 02:30:58.389]  But under a republic, a sheep's right to life is protected by the rule of law.
[02:30:58.389 --> 02:31:00.792]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[02:31:01.152 --> 02:31:02.973]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:31:02.973 --> 02:31:05.054]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:31:05.054 --> 02:31:07.975]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:31:07.975 --> 02:31:14.018]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:14.018 --> 02:31:23.223]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:31:23.223 --> 02:31:28.065]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.

[02:31:30.749 --> 02:31:38.783]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:38.783 --> 02:31:39.744]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:40.948 --> 02:31:44.890]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:44.890 --> 02:31:48.472]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:48.472 --> 02:31:55.175]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:55.175 --> 02:31:59.257]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4westore.com.

[02:32:07.970 --> 02:32:09.670]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.

[02:32:12.111 --> 02:32:13.311]  It's been sold out for months.
[02:32:13.311 --> 02:32:14.192]  Big waiting list.
[02:32:14.192 --> 02:32:18.033]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[02:32:18.033 --> 02:32:18.933]  Nobody's got something this great.
[02:32:18.953 --> 02:32:19.613]  We're good to go.
[02:32:40.739 --> 02:32:42.480]  10% off when you choose auto ship.
[02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:48.362]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist years ago.
[02:32:48.362 --> 02:32:48.943]  Now it's epidemic.
[02:32:48.943 --> 02:32:51.904]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them.

[02:33:20.795 --> 02:33:22.697]  I'm David Knight with Owen Schroer.
[02:33:22.697 --> 02:33:28.382]  We're going to have a report from Alex Jones talking about this Wall Street Journal story.
[02:33:28.382 --> 02:33:33.507]  The post office gives Amazon special delivery subsidies of $1.46 per package.

[02:35:17.650 --> 02:35:27.918]  Let's go to Alex's report where he's talking about Amazon, as we see that Jeff Bezos is on target to become the richest man in the world, but then he gets subsidies from the U.S.
[02:35:27.918 --> 02:35:34.564]  government for shipping his mail-order products as he puts out bricks and mortar stores are going out of business left and right.
[02:35:34.564 --> 02:35:35.985]  Here's that report from Alex Jones.
[02:35:37.529 --> 02:35:47.975]  It's less and less common to read mainstream media and see a story that actually tells the truth and actually stands up for the general public and a free and open society.
[02:35:47.975 --> 02:35:54.759]  But I read one of those articles today by a Josh Sandbute from the Wall Street Journal.
[02:35:54.759 --> 02:35:58.362]  Why the post office gives Amazon special delivery.
[02:35:58.362 --> 02:36:02.484]  A Citigroup analysis finds each box gets a $1.46 subsidy.
[02:36:02.484 --> 02:36:04.645]  It's like a giant gift card from Uncle Sam.
[02:36:05.746 --> 02:36:20.772]  And behind every mega-rich person, whether it's Warren Buffett or Carlos Slim or the Rockefeller and Rothschild dynasties, it's government-corporate partnerships that create the mega-super-wealthy.
[02:36:20.772 --> 02:36:27.014]  And that's why John D. I famously wrote and stated many times that the cardinal sin was competition.
[02:36:28.030 --> 02:36:30.672]  Crony capitalists want consolidation.
[02:36:30.672 --> 02:36:36.816]  They want governmental and multinational control, which they write and which they are largely exempt from, just like the U.N.
[02:36:36.816 --> 02:36:41.159]  diplomatic community and tax immunity and all the rest of it set up by the Rockefellers.
[02:36:41.159 --> 02:36:46.082]  And in this article, he breaks down, well, you know, I drive by all the retail collapsing and think, oh, that's just free market.
[02:36:46.082 --> 02:36:47.243]  There'll be winners and losers.
[02:36:47.243 --> 02:36:57.790]  But then he realizes as a business researcher and writer that the truth is when the trucks pull up to his house and neighbors houses, they each have a dollar forty six subsidy on the average package.
[02:36:59.433 --> 02:37:06.989]  From the US Postal Service, delivering it to your door, cheaper than it costs the Postal Service.
[02:37:06.989 --> 02:37:07.550]  But here's the deal.
[02:37:08.766 --> 02:37:14.412]  Only big megacorporations basically get the subsidiary, and the more they ship, the more they get.
[02:37:14.412 --> 02:37:27.965]  And so that's why we have to offer free shipping to even attract people to InfoWareStore.com, even though we have a lot of proprietary great products, because Amazon has created this climate, and it's not free market, it's done by subsidizing
[02:37:29.586 --> 02:37:40.712]  Their system via the taxpayers, just like Carlos Slim made $10 billion roughly in profit off of the Obama phone program that cost, what was it, $3 billion or more a year.
[02:37:41.972 --> 02:37:43.013]  Okay.
[02:37:43.013 --> 02:37:44.673]  And he's one of the richest men in the world.
[02:37:44.673 --> 02:37:50.416]  It's in between Bezos of Amazon and the Washington Post and Whole Foods.
[02:37:50.416 --> 02:37:53.938]  It's in between that Robert Barron.
[02:37:53.938 --> 02:37:55.479]  And it's in between Carlos Slim.
[02:37:55.479 --> 02:37:57.279]  Now that's who publicly is the richest.
[02:37:57.279 --> 02:37:59.601]  There's a lot of old money that's even bigger than that.
[02:38:00.661 --> 02:38:04.245]  But they go over this whole subsidy that's behind it.
[02:38:04.245 --> 02:38:15.655]  And that's why I've told my wife, I've told everybody, if something is available somewhere else, even if it's another big company, try to go buy it from them, or a mom and pop, or let's go to the farmer's market.
[02:38:15.655 --> 02:38:21.580]  We've got to keep competition alive because these monopolies are coming in and are devastating things.
[02:38:21.580 --> 02:38:23.162]  And it's time to break these monopolies up.
[02:38:23.602 --> 02:38:27.467]  You know, until a few years ago, we sold our items on Amazon, and we sold quite a bit.
[02:38:27.467 --> 02:38:29.570]  A lot of folks buy our items and resell them.
[02:38:29.570 --> 02:38:31.773]  There's also some Chinese fakes on Amazon.
[02:38:31.773 --> 02:38:33.936]  That's how popular InfoWarsLife.com is.
[02:38:33.936 --> 02:38:38.481]  But I said, let's just pull our Amazon shopping carts, because I don't want to contribute to this.
[02:38:39.881 --> 02:38:41.902]  But it's getting to a point where if you can't beat them, join them.
[02:38:41.902 --> 02:38:43.582]  Well, I'm going to hold out.
[02:38:43.582 --> 02:38:48.984]  And I'm going to believe folks are going to keep visiting InfoWarsTore.com and supporting us there and buying products there.
[02:38:48.984 --> 02:38:51.585]  This isn't about just a plug today.
[02:38:51.585 --> 02:39:00.728]  This is about realizing that I talk to my neighbors and others and I say, listen, we don't go to Starbucks anymore because they're trying to bring in radical jihadis and pushing to implode our borders and globalism.
[02:39:02.488 --> 02:39:09.591]  I've told my assistant, please don't buy Starbucks coffee here at my house anymore.
[02:39:09.591 --> 02:39:10.652]  I said, just get a grinder.
[02:39:10.652 --> 02:39:12.733]  We'll grind the good coffee we sell.
[02:39:12.733 --> 02:39:13.153]  It's better.
[02:39:13.153 --> 02:39:14.133]  It's organic.
[02:39:14.133 --> 02:39:17.034]  And then I'll put it in the little Keurig machine.
[02:39:17.034 --> 02:39:22.497]  But again, the globalists promote things like the Keurig machine, you know, the little scissors where you put the little
[02:39:23.337 --> 02:39:40.552]  Capsule in there because it's all about removing you from the raw material removing you from processing yourself It's like having these automatic can openers where you where a machine does it we're being dehumanized I'm not saying it's bad to automate some things It's like wearing shoes or having a car.
[02:39:40.552 --> 02:39:47.297]  It's just that it's being designed as a Trojan horse to weaken us to domesticate us and the social engineers
[02:39:48.598 --> 02:39:49.218]  Admit that.
[02:39:49.218 --> 02:39:50.779]  So the article is very, very important.
[02:39:50.779 --> 02:39:54.179]  It goes over how all of this happens.
[02:39:54.179 --> 02:39:56.320]  And then they claim it's an accident.
[02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:59.101]  No, no, this isn't an accident.
[02:39:59.101 --> 02:40:02.802]  This arrangement is an unprecedented accident of history.
[02:40:02.802 --> 02:40:07.803]  The post office has long had a legal monopoly to deliver first class mail on non-
[02:40:10.191 --> 02:40:11.551]  Urgent letters.
[02:40:11.551 --> 02:40:17.492]  The exclusivity comes with a universal service obligation to provide for all Americans a uniform price equality.
[02:40:17.492 --> 02:40:22.733]  The communications service helps knit the vast country together and it's the postal service exists.
[02:40:22.733 --> 02:40:24.074]  It's how they exist.
[02:40:24.074 --> 02:40:26.154]  And then it just goes on to explain how this works.
[02:40:26.154 --> 02:40:32.275]  The point is it's one monopoly or oligopoly allowing another oligopoly to basically turn into a monopoly.
[02:40:32.275 --> 02:40:36.176]  And it's these big massive taxpayer-backed structures that allow this.
[02:40:36.176 --> 02:40:37.236]  And if you expand on that
[02:40:38.171 --> 02:40:39.712]  Look at health care.
[02:40:39.712 --> 02:40:43.754]  Undoubtedly, from the 1960s, the United States had the best health care in the world.
[02:40:43.754 --> 02:40:45.015]  Japanese royalty came here.
[02:40:45.015 --> 02:40:46.035]  British royalty came here.
[02:40:46.035 --> 02:40:48.337]  You know, the Saudi rich people came here.
[02:40:48.337 --> 02:40:49.517]  Everybody came here.
[02:40:49.517 --> 02:40:51.398]  National Health Service was a nightmare.
[02:40:51.398 --> 02:40:52.559]  Canada's system was a nightmare.
[02:40:52.559 --> 02:40:54.000]  On and on and on.
[02:40:55.445 --> 02:41:03.711]  And then as we put more and more government money in, just like education, it drove up the price and it destroyed basic competition.
[02:41:03.711 --> 02:41:13.759]  And now it's a huge bureaucratic nightmare with the big insurance companies and banks riding Obamacare bipartisanly to bankrupt smaller companies and bankrupt smaller health care companies and consolidate the market.
[02:41:13.759 --> 02:41:15.500]  That's what Elizabeth Warren admits.
[02:41:15.500 --> 02:41:17.101]  It's what Ezekiel Emanuel admits.
[02:41:17.101 --> 02:41:23.366]  And that's what's frustrating is they admit it but act like blowing up competition and vertically integrating things is somehow
[02:41:23.966 --> 02:41:28.269]  Socialist and loving and liberal, when it's a bunch of mega-corporations that run it.
[02:41:28.269 --> 02:41:37.115]  It's globalists that exploit China's slave labor that, of course, Walmart did first for decades and now is in decline because other people are imitating it.
[02:41:37.115 --> 02:41:37.875]  And it's the same thing.
[02:41:37.875 --> 02:41:40.037]  Now we have Amazon eating Walmart.
[02:41:40.037 --> 02:41:42.779]  So first Walmart ate Main Street, now
[02:41:43.928 --> 02:41:46.370]  We see Amazon eating everything.
[02:41:59.042 --> 02:42:03.425]  And then try to shut the loopholes off to everybody else and pull up the ladders of success.
[02:42:03.425 --> 02:42:04.905]  That's what globalism is.
[02:42:04.905 --> 02:42:05.846]  It's great crime is.
[02:42:05.846 --> 02:42:07.987]  It's pushing austerity on everybody.
[02:42:07.987 --> 02:42:11.589]  And Trump's great plus is he recognizes that he's trying to fight it.
[02:42:11.589 --> 02:42:13.010]  He's certainly imperfect.
[02:42:13.010 --> 02:42:15.591]  But again, imagine if we had Hillary Clinton in there right now.
[02:42:15.591 --> 02:42:17.612]  And imagine if they get back in power, what they're going to do.
[02:42:17.612 --> 02:42:19.533]  They're going to clamp down on everything.
[02:42:19.533 --> 02:42:20.314]  Back to David Knight.
[02:42:20.914 --> 02:42:25.477]  Back to Leanne McAdoo, back to Owen Schroeder, and others in the live studio.
[02:42:25.477 --> 02:42:27.298]  Infowars.com, spread that link.
[02:42:27.298 --> 02:42:29.719]  It is an act of resistance.
[02:42:29.719 --> 02:42:31.360]  Seriously, folks are trying to shut us down.
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:35.743]  And they can shut us down, or weaken us, or keep us from breaking through even more.
[02:42:35.743 --> 02:42:36.323]  You're next.
[02:42:36.323 --> 02:42:36.944]  We're all next.
[02:42:36.944 --> 02:42:38.044]  We're in this together.
[02:42:38.044 --> 02:42:39.765]  Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[02:42:39.765 --> 02:42:46.089]  Again, if you're watching and listening to this transmission, you are the reason we're here, and I salute you, and thank you for all you've done.
[02:42:46.089 --> 02:42:48.271]  Please remember, we have free shipping through the month of July.
[02:42:49.211 --> 02:42:52.412]  Our average package cost us over $7 to ship.
[02:42:52.412 --> 02:42:55.153]  For the average weight and average package for priority.
[02:42:55.153 --> 02:42:59.834]  And so when we're selling something for $20, we're making $10 on it.
[02:42:59.834 --> 02:43:02.655]  And then we do free shipping, we're making like $3.
[02:43:02.655 --> 02:43:06.116]  But I'm just absolutely giving the enemy a run for their money.
[02:43:06.956 --> 02:43:09.938]  And, uh, we always have free shipping, $50 or more.
[02:43:09.938 --> 02:43:10.899]  We have 10% off.
[02:43:10.899 --> 02:43:11.979]  We sign up for auto ships.
[02:43:11.979 --> 02:43:16.762]  You can get, you know, stuff that you need to reorder like vitamins and minerals and supplements and coffee.
[02:43:16.762 --> 02:43:22.885]  But just please commit to supporting Free Market that also supports your freedoms and powerlessly fights.
[02:43:22.885 --> 02:43:25.707]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:25.707 --> 02:43:27.568]  You can also call and talk to a human, 888-253-3139.
[02:43:31.070 --> 02:43:33.573]  We have DNA Force back in stock, 20% off.
[02:43:33.573 --> 02:43:41.002]  We have MycoZX, the amazing paradigm that completes the circle when it comes to probiotics.
[02:43:41.002 --> 02:43:43.264]  Knocks out the yeast and all the rest of the garbage.
[02:43:43.264 --> 02:43:45.267]  It's all available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:45.267 --> 02:43:48.951]  Be sure to get your CNN Estate News t-shirts on the back, InfoWars.com.
[02:43:50.272 --> 02:43:50.953]  It's real news.
[02:43:50.953 --> 02:43:55.015]  Great way to meet people and spread the word and break the back of those censors.
[02:43:55.015 --> 02:43:57.356]  Again, back to David Knight and the rest of the amazing crew.
[02:43:57.356 --> 02:44:00.018]  And I'll be back live this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:44:00.018 --> 02:44:01.278]  Central.
[02:44:01.278 --> 02:44:02.419]  Again, thank you all for the support.
[02:44:03.462 --> 02:44:05.604]  All right, I'm David Knight here with Owen Schroer.
[02:44:05.604 --> 02:44:14.373]  As Alex was just saying about Amazon, we look at these 21st century robber barons and one of the best examples of this, of course, is Jeff Bezos.
[02:44:14.373 --> 02:44:18.818]  When he's talking about what's going on with the post office, I remember, Owen, decades ago, 20-plus years ago,
[02:44:20.860 --> 02:44:34.856]  Some of the people that were involved in the Libertarian Party were working for UPS and they were very upset about what was going on with the post office because the post office was using its monopoly on letters to subsidize competing with UPS and with Federal Express on packages.
[02:44:35.657 --> 02:44:43.101]  And on overnight delivery of, you know, the package of what made Federal Express popular was their overnight delivery of letters.
[02:44:43.101 --> 02:44:45.082]  UPS was focusing on parcels.
[02:44:45.082 --> 02:44:51.265]  And so the Postal Service was using its letter carrying stuff to subsidize those parcel deliveries.
[02:44:51.265 --> 02:44:54.066]  But then they got in trouble, as this article points out.
[02:44:54.066 --> 02:44:58.628]  In the early 2000s, email started making snail mail go away.
[02:44:58.628 --> 02:45:01.450]  And so there, their protected monopoly started collapsing.
[02:45:02.270 --> 02:45:12.816]  And it got even harder for them, because in 2006, Congress passed an act that made it unlawful for them to ship parcels at below cost.
[02:45:12.816 --> 02:45:15.978]  But, as the article points out, that's very subjective.
[02:45:15.978 --> 02:45:16.659]  Who knows?
[02:45:16.659 --> 02:45:18.380]  Because this stuff all flows together.
[02:45:18.380 --> 02:45:23.343]  How do you assess the cost of delivering a letter and delivering a parcel at the same time?
[02:45:23.343 --> 02:45:25.624]  The guy's going out there at the same time.
[02:45:25.624 --> 02:45:28.126]  How do you split the cost of one versus the other?
[02:45:28.126 --> 02:45:29.487]  So that gave them wiggle room.
[02:45:30.447 --> 02:45:39.611]  And that's what allows Amazon to come in and get a $1.46 subsidy off of this, because they're big enough to take advantage of this in a way that other people can't.
[02:45:39.611 --> 02:45:50.196]  So you've got a government monopoly setting up a situation where one of these oligarchists can come in and they can take advantage of that in a way that the rest of us can't.
[02:45:50.196 --> 02:45:54.058]  That's the problem that we see being replicated over and over again in our economy.
[02:45:54.058 --> 02:45:55.499]  We're going to see it with transportation.
[02:45:55.859 --> 02:45:56.420]  Very soon.
[02:45:56.420 --> 02:46:10.692]  They're going to make it impossible for you to own a car because the city planners, the urban planners, the people who want to enforce Agenda 21, or as they now call it, the 2030 UN Agenda for Sustainability, they don't want you to have the ability to move around independent of them.
[02:46:10.692 --> 02:46:12.654]  They want to own your transportation.
[02:46:12.654 --> 02:46:15.036]  Understand, this is full-on warfare.
[02:46:15.456 --> 02:46:21.543]  And if you're in warfare against the people, against their freedom, you have to control the movement, the transportation.
[02:46:21.543 --> 02:46:28.031]  It's the first thing if you've got an invading army, the first thing they're going to do is come in and shut off the means of transportation.
[02:46:28.031 --> 02:46:30.194]  That's what they're going to be doing to us shortly.
[02:46:30.194 --> 02:46:32.737]  They always want to own everything.
[02:46:33.197 --> 02:46:52.175]  And when we look at what's happening with Jeff Bezos and the articles that have come out in the Drudge Report and many others today over this last week, people have said Amazon is getting so big I'm putting them on my sale list because I have seen that there are things working in Washington to essentially shut down what is rapidly becoming a monopoly.
[02:46:52.175 --> 02:46:52.755]  Nevertheless,
[02:46:53.596 --> 02:46:55.817]  Jeff Bezos is about to become the richest man in the world.
[02:46:55.817 --> 02:46:59.478]  He made $20 billion increase in his net worth.
[02:46:59.478 --> 02:47:07.581]  And Owen, as we were talking during the break, I said, that's equivalent, if you look at him buying the Washington Post, because that's what he's thinking strategically.
[02:47:07.581 --> 02:47:11.543]  He understands there's going to be antitrust movements against him in Washington.
[02:47:11.963 --> 02:47:17.005]  He also understands that he wants to be able to deliver packages himself with his own drones.
[02:47:17.005 --> 02:47:22.707]  He's going to have to have government approval for that to give him an advantage over everybody else.
[02:47:22.707 --> 02:47:29.729]  He'll be allowed to use drones to deliver stuff, but you won't with your small business because you're not going to be able to pass the regulatory hurdles.
[02:47:29.949 --> 02:47:31.191]  He's going to make sure that that happens.
[02:47:31.191 --> 02:47:35.879]  He's also going to make sure that he has access to what he wants to do in space.
[02:47:35.879 --> 02:47:39.465]  An important part of that is to get politically involved with the Washington Post.
[02:47:39.465 --> 02:47:43.471]  We've seen the Washington Post get very politicized after Jeff Bezos bought it.
[02:47:43.471 --> 02:47:44.333]  What did it cost him?
[02:47:45.083 --> 02:47:55.586]  Well, if we look at the kind of money that he's making, and the amount of money that he paid for the Washington Post, $250 million sounds like a lot of money, except when we look at somebody who made $20 billion in just five months.
[02:47:55.586 --> 02:48:00.268]  Let's normalize that to somebody that is making $50,000, which is what the average American makes.
[02:48:00.268 --> 02:48:05.250]  That means that you could buy the Amazon Post for $300.
[02:48:05.250 --> 02:48:10.851]  I mean, would you buy a paper that you could use to influence Washington for $300?
[02:48:12.512 --> 02:48:14.434]  Of course you would, and that's exactly what he's doing.
[02:48:14.434 --> 02:48:16.056]  That's the way this guy is playing the game.
[02:48:16.056 --> 02:48:17.237]  It's very, very dangerous.
[02:48:17.237 --> 02:48:22.662]  Well, not only that, you would also do it if you knew that some of the money of that $300 was coming from the government.
[02:48:22.662 --> 02:48:25.044]  If you were saying, I'm getting $150 of that from the government, 50%?
[02:48:25.044 --> 02:48:26.766]  Well, heck yeah!
[02:48:26.766 --> 02:48:28.968]  And that is what they're trying to do.
[02:48:28.968 --> 02:48:34.594]  Bezos, Slim, Buffett, publicly pleading poverty, ask Congress for help with their newspapers.
[02:48:34.594 --> 02:48:35.675]  The richest men in the world!
[02:48:36.555 --> 02:48:37.816]  And this is a typical thing.
[02:48:37.816 --> 02:48:41.377]  I mean, you know, you'll actually see this a lot in media companies that fail.
[02:48:41.377 --> 02:48:43.238]  They try to get government bailouts.
[02:48:43.238 --> 02:48:47.840]  And it usually is the richest people at the company that get these bailouts because they don't want to pay these bills.
[02:48:47.840 --> 02:48:49.801]  They don't want to make this bad business deal.
[02:48:49.801 --> 02:48:50.922]  But it's absurd that, again...
[02:48:51.818 --> 02:48:59.642]  As the story on the New York Sun points out, Bezos worth over $80 million, Slim worth over $60 billion, Buffett worth over $70 billion, that's what we know of.
[02:48:59.642 --> 02:49:03.343]  And these people want money from the government to save their failing businesses?
[02:49:03.343 --> 02:49:05.344]  Excuse me, that's not how America works.
[02:49:05.344 --> 02:49:15.869]  And now it gets back to what you were talking about and how Amazon is now going to get this nice little kickback from the government, basically, with these parcels that they're going to be sending out.
[02:49:16.149 --> 02:49:16.990]  Oh, they're getting it.
[02:49:16.990 --> 02:49:17.490]  They're getting it.
[02:49:17.490 --> 02:49:18.811]  They're able to take advantage of that.
[02:49:18.811 --> 02:49:19.471]  Well, it makes sense.
[02:49:19.471 --> 02:49:22.373]  You say, okay, well, of course, that makes sense for the private business owner.
[02:49:22.373 --> 02:49:23.394]  He's going to make more money.
[02:49:23.394 --> 02:49:25.195]  His business is going to be more successful.
[02:49:25.195 --> 02:49:26.335]  That makes sense for the government.
[02:49:26.335 --> 02:49:27.576]  The government's going to have some say.
[02:49:27.576 --> 02:49:28.817]  The government's going to have some control.
[02:49:28.817 --> 02:49:31.699]  They're going to have a little leverage in this situation, considering they're involved now.
[02:49:32.239 --> 02:49:33.580]  But you know what it doesn't make sense for?
[02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:35.360]  It doesn't make sense for America.
[02:49:35.360 --> 02:49:37.121]  It doesn't make sense for the consumer.
[02:49:37.121 --> 02:49:38.742]  It doesn't make sense for the Republic.
[02:49:38.742 --> 02:49:39.942]  And that's the problem.
[02:49:39.942 --> 02:49:42.463]  Nobody is thinking about that when they're making these deals.
[02:49:42.463 --> 02:49:44.004]  They're thinking about the bottom line.
[02:49:44.004 --> 02:49:45.664]  And this is where government has gone wrong.
[02:49:45.664 --> 02:49:47.945]  You know, that was what the government was supposed to be here to do.
[02:49:47.945 --> 02:49:49.166]  To watch the N.I.
[02:49:49.166 --> 02:49:55.328]  Trust, to make sure that freedoms were being protected, and that we still lived in a Republic ruled by the Constitution.
[02:49:55.328 --> 02:49:57.289]  And that's just, the government's completely missed that.
[02:49:57.609 --> 02:50:05.711]  And this is the kind of same story when you hear these newspaper owners that just, like you said, they buy these newspapers for pennies on the dollar just for political influence.
[02:50:05.711 --> 02:50:06.511]  That's it.
[02:50:06.511 --> 02:50:07.491]  Not even to make money.
[02:50:07.491 --> 02:50:08.971]  They don't need the money.
[02:50:08.971 --> 02:50:11.012]  You know, going back into the middle of the 1800s.
[02:50:11.012 --> 02:50:12.792]  It's just like, I just want to finish it.
[02:50:12.792 --> 02:50:19.154]  It's just like when you have a billionaire sports team owner asking taxpayers to pay for their stadiums.
[02:50:19.154 --> 02:50:19.514]  Oh yeah.
[02:50:19.514 --> 02:50:21.094]  They always get the subsidy.
[02:50:21.094 --> 02:50:21.694]  What?
[02:50:21.694 --> 02:50:21.994]  Yeah.
[02:50:21.994 --> 02:50:24.115]  So that we can watch the millionaires play ball.
[02:50:24.115 --> 02:50:24.275]  Yeah.
[02:50:25.495 --> 02:50:28.136]  And the billionaires get richer.
[02:50:28.136 --> 02:50:32.838]  We give money to the billionaires to build their stadium and we watch the millionaires play a child's game.
[02:50:32.838 --> 02:50:36.840]  I want you to pay to build the stadium and then pay to come and use it too.
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:39.721]  You know, libertarians have always fought this postal monopoly.
[02:50:39.721 --> 02:50:40.761]  We had Lysander Spooner.
[02:50:40.761 --> 02:50:41.462]  Look him up.
[02:50:41.462 --> 02:50:43.763]  This is a guy that brought the post office to its knees.
[02:50:43.763 --> 02:50:53.587]  They were charging outrageous fees and he went into competition with them, got it as a fraction, and that's one of the ways that they put in to protect themselves these monopoly laws.
[02:50:53.587 --> 02:50:54.427]  Davis will be right back.
[02:51:01.081 --> 02:51:03.022]  Are you looking to become more self-sufficient?
[02:51:03.022 --> 02:51:05.263]  Then you need to have your own energy source.

[02:52:13.415 --> 02:52:17.218]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[02:52:17.218 --> 02:52:17.938]  Nobody's got something
[02:52:17.978 --> 02:52:18.578]  We're good to go.

[02:52:47.403 --> 02:52:47.984]  Now it's epidemic.

[02:55:41.827 --> 02:55:44.170]  Let's talk about Mark Zuckerberg and what he figured out.
[02:55:45.029 --> 02:55:47.912]  It's an interesting story from Zero Hedge, a little bit of sarcasm.
[02:55:47.912 --> 02:55:57.823]  They point out, as Zuckerberg apparently learned for the first time while visiting oil workers in North Dakota, there are entire industries that exist outside of Silicon Valley.
[02:55:57.823 --> 02:55:58.323]  And you know what?
[02:55:58.323 --> 02:56:04.210]  Those industries that are outside of Silicon Valley are some of the same industries that Obama and Hillary Clinton had said they were going to shut down.
[02:56:04.770 --> 02:56:07.512]  So he's trying to get an idea of why people voted for Trump.
[02:56:07.512 --> 02:56:10.635]  This is what he wrote in his Facebook post when he talked to some of these people.
[02:56:10.635 --> 02:56:21.743]  He said he went to a town where there were tens of thousands of workers who had moved from all over the country to pursue new jobs in an industry where they could get, with just a high school diploma, they could get $100,000 a year working in the oil business.
[02:56:24.465 --> 02:56:31.907]  And he says, when the Dakota Access Pipeline was approved, it removed a $6 to $7 per barrel cost of producing oil in the region.
[02:56:31.907 --> 02:56:33.968]  He said it brought more investment and jobs there.
[02:56:33.968 --> 02:56:35.588]  And this is the interesting thing.
[02:56:35.588 --> 02:56:39.669]  A number of people told me they had felt their livelihood was blocked by the government.
[02:56:39.669 --> 02:56:40.409]  No, really?
[02:56:40.409 --> 02:56:45.991]  You mean when Hillary Clinton said, and Obama said, we're going to bankrupt you if you do coal?
[02:56:45.991 --> 02:56:48.672]  They're going to bankrupt the country because that's what our energy is based on.
[02:56:48.672 --> 02:56:52.753]  But when Trump approved the pipeline, they felt a sense of hope.
[02:56:53.513 --> 02:56:53.833]  Again.
[02:56:53.833 --> 02:56:55.274]  Remember that word, hope?
[02:56:55.274 --> 02:56:58.436]  Remember how Barack Obama used it and he gave us a false hope?
[02:56:58.436 --> 02:56:59.816]  No, these people had a real hope.
[02:56:59.816 --> 02:57:09.922]  They said, one person told me the night the pipeline was approved, people lit fireworks and they rode trucks with American flags up and down Main Street to celebrate.
[02:57:09.922 --> 02:57:13.063]  So there's the education of Zuckerberg.
[02:57:13.063 --> 02:57:21.508]  He finally went to flyover country and he talked to some people about why they voted and it didn't have anything to do with the Russians, it had to do
[02:57:22.108 --> 02:57:29.250]  With the Democrats who wanted to shut down their jobs, shut down our economies, and they were sick and tired of it.
[02:57:29.250 --> 02:57:40.612]  You know, when you talk about the hope thing, the fake hope about Obama, it reminded me of how Michelle Obama came out after Trump got elected and said, well, I think now people aren't feeling hope.
[02:57:40.612 --> 02:57:41.753]  Now I don't feel hope.
[02:57:41.753 --> 02:57:44.793]  Michelle Obama saying now there is no hope because Trump got elected.
[02:57:44.793 --> 02:57:51.075]  Well, again, another example of, well, she's probably just completely fake news or you could say out of touch with reality.
[02:57:51.915 --> 02:57:52.996]  This is hope.
[02:57:52.996 --> 02:57:54.417]  Trump is the real hope.
[02:57:54.417 --> 02:57:56.719]  Trump is the first time people actually had hope.
[02:57:56.719 --> 02:58:03.564]  And the people that bought in to the hope that Obama was selling, they realized he was a fraud.
[02:58:03.564 --> 02:58:05.586]  Now they're on the hope for Trump.
[02:58:05.586 --> 02:58:07.928]  And you know, there's nothing in here about racism.
[02:58:08.328 --> 02:58:11.810]  You know, people could go to the, they needed a high school, you know, high school diploma.
[02:58:11.810 --> 02:58:13.311]  Not even need that, probably.
[02:58:13.311 --> 02:58:18.233]  But no matter what race you were, you could go there to get a job because the economy wasn't being shut down.
[02:58:18.233 --> 02:58:21.795]  That was opportunity for anybody, regardless of what color they were.
[02:58:21.795 --> 02:58:22.856]  That is real hope.
[02:58:22.856 --> 02:58:24.056]  No, there's no hope.
[02:58:24.056 --> 02:58:24.917]  No, no hope, David.
[02:58:24.917 --> 02:58:27.458]  Just fireworks and American flags and celebration.
[02:58:27.458 --> 02:58:29.880]  Sounds like there's no hope in an oil country here.
[02:58:29.880 --> 02:58:30.300]  Stay with us.
[02:58:30.300 --> 02:58:31.000]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:34.022]  And then Mark Cernovich is going to be taking over in the fourth hour.
[02:58:41.348 --> 02:58:44.610]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.610 --> 02:58:46.811]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.169 --> 02:58:57.672]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[02:58:57.672 --> 02:59:10.657]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[02:59:10.657 --> 02:59:14.318]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[02:59:14.318 --> 02:59:17.960]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today,
[02:59:18.160 --> 02:59:21.281]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[02:59:21.281 --> 02:59:34.166]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[02:59:34.166 --> 02:59:35.707]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[02:59:36.007 --> 02:59:42.389]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[02:59:47.311 --> 02:59:48.852]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:07.449 --> 03:00:08.670]  You found it.
[03:00:08.670 --> 03:00:10.351]  The tip of the spear.
[03:00:10.351 --> 03:00:14.854]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:14.854 --> 03:00:18.757]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[03:00:18.757 --> 03:00:21.419]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:21.419 --> 03:00:22.960]  I'm David Knight, here with Owen Schroer.
[03:00:22.960 --> 03:00:27.803]  Let's take a moment and talk about this newest Clinton side.
[03:00:27.803 --> 03:00:32.986]  Somebody committing suicide who was involved in investigating the Clintons.
[03:00:32.986 --> 03:00:35.428]  This latest person is Peter W. Smith.
[03:00:35.428 --> 03:00:36.509]  He's a GOP operative.
[03:00:36.909 --> 03:00:42.333]  And of course, the Chicago Tribune doesn't have a problem calling it suicide, but a lot of other people do.
[03:00:42.333 --> 03:00:44.174]  A congressman has a problem with it.
[03:00:44.174 --> 03:00:46.956]  A senior Wall Street Journal writer has a problem with it.
[03:00:46.956 --> 03:00:49.417]  These are people who were in contact with him.
[03:00:49.417 --> 03:00:54.580]  They're not buying it, and there are some very suspicious issues surrounding his death.
[03:00:54.580 --> 03:00:55.641]  He leaves a suicide note.
[03:00:55.641 --> 03:00:59.063]  First of all, he has a bag around his head with helium attached to it.
[03:00:59.063 --> 03:01:00.684]  That's bizarre to start with.
[03:01:00.684 --> 03:01:01.125]  It's all bizarre.
[03:01:01.125 --> 03:01:04.067]  Then he writes a note that says, no foul play whatsoever.
[03:01:04.827 --> 03:01:06.929]  Move along, there's nothing to see here.
[03:01:06.929 --> 03:01:16.941]  And says, I'm taking my life because of a recent bad turn in health since January 2017, and I'm doing this now because my life insurance policy of $5 million is expiring.
[03:01:16.941 --> 03:01:24.530]  Well, he would know that if you commit suicide, and if you leave a note saying that you're committing suicide, you're not going to get payment.
[03:01:24.530 --> 03:01:25.351]  To get insurance.
[03:01:25.891 --> 03:01:27.513]  I'm on life insurance policy.
[03:01:27.513 --> 03:01:46.049]  So I mean that is absolutely absurd and the Congressman Ted Lieu says you don't need to be a prosecutor to know that someone writing no foul play whatsoever in connection with a death seems awfully suspicious and the senior Wall Street Journal writer Shane Harris also retweeted last night that there were no signs that Smith was about to commit suicide.
[03:01:46.049 --> 03:01:47.430]  He said when I spoke to Peter Smith
[03:01:47.950 --> 03:01:51.972]  I had no indication that he was ill or that he was planning to take his own life.
[03:01:51.972 --> 03:01:56.655]  As a matter of fact, one of his former employees said he was there getting treatment.
[03:01:56.655 --> 03:01:58.396]  He was working to get well.
[03:01:58.396 --> 03:02:00.197]  And then he says, well, I'm going to take my life.
[03:02:00.197 --> 03:02:04.780]  Very much like what we saw with Aaron Schwartz, who supposedly committed suicide.
[03:02:04.780 --> 03:02:07.061]  And this is a guy who also was a fighter.
[03:02:07.061 --> 03:02:09.243]  He was fighting SISPA, ACTA, PIPA.
[03:02:10.023 --> 03:02:10.923]  Fighting everything there.
[03:02:10.923 --> 03:02:24.609]  He had turned down an offer to do just 30 months from this prosecutor when they came under a lot of criticism for prosecuting him for a non-crime and then all of a sudden he commits suicide.
[03:02:24.609 --> 03:02:31.111]  Yeah, it was Carmen Ortiz, a very corrupt judge in the Northeast that was in that case.
[03:02:31.111 --> 03:02:34.913]  You know, David, this is the Clintons, I think, getting more brazen
[03:02:35.493 --> 03:02:38.358]  Or just the whole, you know, the whole, you know, you don't have to use Clinton's name.
[03:02:38.358 --> 03:02:41.844]  I mean, they can be associated with like a list of over 50 dead bodies now.
[03:02:41.844 --> 03:02:43.206]  So you call it the Clinton body count.
[03:02:43.206 --> 03:02:44.929]  But, you know, who knows what's really going on.
[03:02:44.929 --> 03:02:45.650]  But I think that...
[03:02:46.536 --> 03:02:56.539]  Look, you've got Seth Rich, Barrington Wisenhunt Jr., and Sean Lucas, all potential witnesses in the DNC fraud lawsuit, dead.
[03:02:56.539 --> 03:03:05.341]  And then you've got Peter Smith, who was heavily committed to finding the emails that Hillary Clinton deleted.
[03:03:05.341 --> 03:03:07.622]  He had two things that he was basically doing.
[03:03:07.622 --> 03:03:10.503]  Trying to stay alive, and trying to find Clinton's emails.
[03:03:11.903 --> 03:03:14.704]  And he had a long history of exposing the Clintons too.
[03:03:14.704 --> 03:03:19.025]  And I'm starting to wonder if maybe he hadn't found those emails, David.
[03:03:19.025 --> 03:03:21.546]  And that's why he's no longer with us.
[03:03:21.546 --> 03:03:41.093]  So, it's very amazing to me that within, Seth Rich was I think July 9th or July 6th last year, so you've got just over a year, just over a calendar year, four people associated with the Clintons in one way, shape or form, mysteriously dead.
[03:03:42.148 --> 03:03:48.055]  Now, I'm not allowed to believe in coincidence here, as a reporter, and so I don't believe there's a coincidence here.
[03:03:48.055 --> 03:03:49.616]  I think there's something going on.
[03:03:49.616 --> 03:03:53.561]  As Ron Wyden said, David, it doesn't pass the shmell test.
[03:03:53.561 --> 03:03:54.382]  That's right.
[03:03:54.382 --> 03:03:58.947]  Had the DC madam come on and talk to Alex, and Alex says, you're not getting ready to commit suicide.
[03:03:59.227 --> 03:04:00.027]  No, no, no.
[03:04:00.027 --> 03:04:00.908]  I'm perfectly fine.
[03:04:00.908 --> 03:04:01.808]  I have no interest.
[03:04:01.808 --> 03:04:03.369]  Then she commits suicide.
[03:04:03.369 --> 03:04:07.830]  Or even the spy in the bag situation that they had in Britain.
[03:04:07.830 --> 03:04:16.594]  They have this guy who's working for MI5 and he's found zipped up in a bag in his bathtub dead after he went missing for a few days.
[03:04:17.154 --> 03:04:23.055]  And it was so ridiculous that people say, oh, he committed suicide and zipped himself up in the bag and everybody was laughing at it.
[03:04:23.055 --> 03:04:28.876]  So they hired a contortionist who was small who put himself in a bag.
[03:04:28.876 --> 03:04:29.696]  Professional.
[03:04:29.696 --> 03:04:30.456]  OK, fine.
[03:04:30.456 --> 03:04:34.517]  Let's see you do that without leaving any fingerprints on the zipper or the outside of the bag.
[03:04:34.517 --> 03:04:36.778]  Don't forget Vince Foster.
[03:04:36.778 --> 03:04:42.018]  And I believe Bill Clinton fired the FBI director the day before Vince Foster's death.
[03:04:42.018 --> 03:04:42.218]  Yeah.
[03:04:42.218 --> 03:04:43.039]  I mean, these people.
[03:04:43.039 --> 03:04:43.719]  I'm sorry, David.
[03:04:43.719 --> 03:04:45.079]  It takes everything I can.
[03:04:45.699 --> 03:04:47.602]  Rip this desk out of his mouth right now.
[03:04:47.602 --> 03:04:48.963]  These people are sick.
[03:04:48.963 --> 03:04:49.985]  All right, stay with us.
[03:04:49.985 --> 03:04:51.206]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:51.206 --> 03:04:53.729]  And Cernovich will be taking the helm for the fourth hour.
[03:04:53.729 --> 03:04:54.250]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:01.144 --> 03:05:07.208]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com is writing about it.
[03:05:07.208 --> 03:05:16.474]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[03:05:16.474 --> 03:05:18.816]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh
[03:05:19.016 --> 03:05:20.057]  On the grasshoppers.
[03:05:20.057 --> 03:05:23.440]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune, if they can make money.
[03:05:23.440 --> 03:05:30.147]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[03:05:30.147 --> 03:05:34.631]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[03:05:34.631 --> 03:05:42.038]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[03:05:42.398 --> 03:05:50.866]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasion.
[03:05:50.866 --> 03:05:56.832]  Prepare for the worst case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best case scenario.
[03:05:56.832 --> 03:05:59.714]  Get more information at InfoWars.com.
[03:05:59.714 --> 03:06:00.275]  I'm David Knight.
[03:06:02.056 --> 03:06:07.540]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:06:07.540 --> 03:06:08.380]  I take this.
[03:06:08.380 --> 03:06:09.521]  My family takes this.
[03:06:09.521 --> 03:06:13.804]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:06:13.804 --> 03:06:18.247]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:06:18.407 --> 03:06:23.049]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:06:23.049 --> 03:06:24.170]  I don't feel good.
[03:06:24.170 --> 03:06:27.932]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:06:27.932 --> 03:06:30.613]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:06:30.613 --> 03:06:36.416]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:06:36.416 --> 03:06:39.377]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:06:39.377 --> 03:06:42.919]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:06:42.919 --> 03:06:45.160]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:06:45.160 --> 03:06:45.500]  I love it.
[03:06:45.680 --> 03:06:48.461]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:06:48.461 --> 03:06:49.482]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:06:49.482 --> 03:06:55.124]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:06:55.124 --> 03:06:57.305]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:06:57.305 --> 03:06:59.506]  It's a win-win in FallWarsLive.com.
[03:07:01.141 --> 03:07:05.144]  A new shipment of BioTrue Selenium is now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:07:05.144 --> 03:07:06.606]  We've been sold out for months.
[03:07:06.606 --> 03:07:11.670]  Our one-of-a-kind InfoWarsLife BioTrue Selenium formula is now back in stock at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:07:11.670 --> 03:07:15.833]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[03:07:15.833 --> 03:07:20.357]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.

[03:07:25.481 --> 03:07:28.962]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[03:07:28.962 --> 03:07:33.123]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[03:07:33.123 --> 03:07:35.844]  BioTrue Selenium is also the perfect supercharger.
[03:07:35.844 --> 03:07:38.224]  The survival shield X2 mason iodine.
[03:07:38.224 --> 03:07:41.205]  As both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.

[03:07:58.731 --> 03:08:08.636]  That's InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:08:08.636 --> 03:08:10.777]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:10.777 --> 03:08:14.739]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:08:14.739 --> 03:08:17.761]  And now, your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:08:19.662 --> 03:08:21.707]  And we're back with some breaking news.
[03:08:21.707 --> 03:08:23.492]  We have a lot to talk about today.
[03:08:23.492 --> 03:08:26.539]  We have a great hilarious Megyn Kelly video we're going to watch in a minute.
[03:08:27.279 --> 03:08:29.921]  We have a crooked poster in the background for a movie I did.
[03:08:29.921 --> 03:08:31.362]  I gotta fix that.
[03:08:31.362 --> 03:08:33.363]  But breaking news right now.
[03:08:33.363 --> 03:08:34.924]  CNN is upset.
[03:08:34.924 --> 03:08:37.046]  I'm looking at the article right now.
[03:08:37.046 --> 03:08:37.806]  Trump Jr.'
[03:08:37.786 --> 03:08:40.408]  's Russia meeting a democratic plot.
[03:08:40.408 --> 03:08:42.169]  Pro-Trump media wants you to think so.
[03:08:42.169 --> 03:08:48.934]  CNN just published this article a couple of minutes ago and they called me and asked me for a comment a couple of days ago for the article.
[03:08:48.934 --> 03:08:51.636]  So what we're seeing now in the mainstream media.
[03:08:52.356 --> 03:08:55.358]  They wanted to create this meeting that Don Jr.
[03:08:55.358 --> 03:09:00.860]  had with a publicist and someone else who misrepresented who she was.
[03:09:00.860 --> 03:09:03.602]  They wanted to make it into a big conspiracy theory.
[03:09:03.602 --> 03:09:12.666]  Oh, this is proof that there's collusion, because one time somebody had a five or ten minute meeting with somebody from Russia, therefore it must be collusion.
[03:09:12.666 --> 03:09:21.291]  Well, as it turns out, one of the investigative journalists with Cernovich Media, relying of course on poll and Reddit and other crowdsourced people,
[03:09:22.091 --> 03:09:27.574]  Was able to find out that this person actually had a lot of connections with John McCain.
[03:09:27.574 --> 03:09:31.256]  That this so-called Russian lawyer was a pro-Hillary person.
[03:09:31.256 --> 03:09:37.680]  So what they're saying now, and I'm going to read directly from the article because it really just goes to show how frustrating the media is.
[03:09:37.680 --> 03:09:50.687]  The theory is based on bits of fact that have been taken out of context or spun in misleading ways to paint a picture that the President and his supporters prefer to the one currently dominating much of the media.
[03:09:51.676 --> 03:09:53.936]  So they're projecting onto us.
[03:09:53.936 --> 03:10:00.418]  They're saying the theory that we offer is based on bits of fact that have been taken out of context or spun.
[03:10:00.418 --> 03:10:03.658]  That sounds like the mainstream media every day.
[03:10:03.658 --> 03:10:05.939]  They're the one who takes things out of context.
[03:10:05.939 --> 03:10:09.799]  So to illustrate that, we have a really funny video for you.
[03:10:09.799 --> 03:10:12.280]  I thought that Alex was done with Megyn Kelly.
[03:10:12.280 --> 03:10:14.040]  I feel so bad for her.
[03:10:14.040 --> 03:10:16.320]  But we'll have a little bit of fun with her.
[03:10:16.320 --> 03:10:18.941]  Can you selectively edit a video
[03:10:19.947 --> 03:10:21.188]  Alex Jones isn't going away.
[03:10:32.717 --> 03:10:37.758]  Over the years, his YouTube channel has racked up 1.3 billion views.
[03:10:37.758 --> 03:10:42.719]  He has millions of listeners, in the ear of our current president.
[03:10:42.719 --> 03:10:46.120]  We're going to get to work immediately for the American people.
[03:10:46.120 --> 03:10:51.681]  With the election of Donald Trump, Alex Jones has plans to expand InfoWars.
[03:10:51.681 --> 03:10:54.602]  More studios, more shows, more employees.
[03:10:55.422 --> 03:10:56.603]  More influence.
[03:10:56.603 --> 03:11:03.828]  You have said that it's surreal to say something on InfoWars and then hear it come out of the President of the United States mouth a couple days later.
[03:11:03.828 --> 03:11:07.851]  I mean, that has happened, but... Do you think he's watching?
[03:11:07.851 --> 03:11:11.313]  I mean, I know Trump watches and sees the clips and things.
[03:11:11.313 --> 03:11:18.658]  In December 2015, Mr. Trump appeared on Jones' radio program, offering praise and promises.
[03:11:18.658 --> 03:11:20.160]  I will not let you down.
[03:11:20.160 --> 03:11:23.642]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:11:23.642 --> 03:11:25.043]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot more
[03:11:25.163 --> 03:11:28.485]  The 2016 campaign was good for InfoWars.
[03:11:28.485 --> 03:11:33.428]  Its YouTube monthly views reached 83 million in November 2016.
[03:11:33.428 --> 03:11:38.611]  And when Mr. Trump won, Alex Jones found himself with access to the seat of power.
[03:11:38.611 --> 03:11:42.774]  What is it, do you think, about Alex Jones that President Trump finds so amazing?
[03:11:43.294 --> 03:11:44.755]  I don't want to get into all that.
[03:11:44.755 --> 03:11:48.817]  Jones speaks to his listeners for hours a day, six days a week.
[03:11:48.817 --> 03:11:53.900]  He went into business for himself, founding InfoWars in 1999.
[03:11:53.900 --> 03:11:58.143]  Many doubted his prospects, but he's now worth millions.
[03:11:58.143 --> 03:12:01.244]  Jones uses that money to spread his message.
[03:12:01.244 --> 03:12:03.085]  Tom Brokaw joins us.
[03:12:03.085 --> 03:12:06.908]  Alex Jones, a father, a grandfather, a citizen.
[03:12:07.688 --> 03:12:12.551]  When the internet first arrived, like everyone else, I was bedazzled by its possibilities for good.
[03:12:12.551 --> 03:12:18.495]  And those qualities have only become so much more effective and pervasive.
[03:12:18.495 --> 03:12:20.656]  The war's just begun.
[03:12:20.656 --> 03:12:22.277]  So this is a... we've just got a beachhead.
[03:12:22.277 --> 03:12:26.580]  And so, that's just the start of the war for me.
[03:12:26.580 --> 03:12:29.922]  And Alex Jones goes into battle with a powerful ally.
[03:12:29.922 --> 03:12:35.346]  That pattern is classic Alex Jones.
[03:12:37.910 --> 03:12:44.672]  Gorgeous.
[03:12:44.672 --> 03:12:55.754]  So as you can see, as you can see, that was actually a fan video that was sent to me and his profile was Ricky Jerkface.
[03:12:55.754 --> 03:12:56.854]  He sent that in.
[03:12:56.854 --> 03:12:59.095]  That's an example of selective editing.
[03:12:59.095 --> 03:13:03.656]  So we take, not we, it was given to me, so I'm not going to take credit for another person's work.
[03:13:04.076 --> 03:13:07.601]  This was again sent to me by Ricky Jerkface.
[03:13:07.601 --> 03:13:08.122]  Hilarious.
[03:13:08.122 --> 03:13:13.469]  But it illustrates that you can take any video footage you want and edit it to say whatever you want.
[03:13:13.469 --> 03:13:15.011]  That's why you can't trust edited TV.
[03:13:15.011 --> 03:13:17.194]  So if we showed that video...
[03:13:18.004 --> 03:13:20.746]  We would say Megyn Kelly is praising Alex Jones.
[03:13:20.746 --> 03:13:22.808]  What an amazing puff piece on him.
[03:13:22.808 --> 03:13:26.350]  How can you get publicity like that from the mainstream media?
[03:13:26.350 --> 03:13:28.952]  Well, all they did was they spliced things together.
[03:13:28.952 --> 03:13:37.319]  So as you know, if you watch the Megyn Kelly interview, it was a complete and total hit job the entire time.
[03:13:37.319 --> 03:13:41.362]  But when you cut, you can cut things together, splice things together.
[03:13:41.362 --> 03:13:42.843]  Drew, you know, was showing that
[03:13:43.593 --> 03:13:47.978]  The, you know, some of the questions were eight minutes away from other answers.
[03:13:47.978 --> 03:13:49.820]  You can do that with any kind of video.
[03:13:49.820 --> 03:13:53.804]  And that is why you cannot trust edited video from the mainstream media.
[03:13:53.804 --> 03:13:58.349]  And that is why, too, of course, if you're doing interviews with the mainstream media, you have to record them.
[03:13:59.019 --> 03:14:16.272]  Because if you don't record them, they can make you out to be any kind of monster they want, just as in that great video, you can see that Megyn Kelly did a special, apparently, showing that Alex Jones, which is the great man, Tom Rather, or Tom Brokaw, or whatever his name is, even comes out.
[03:14:16.272 --> 03:14:18.514]  Alex Jones, a great family man, father.
[03:14:18.514 --> 03:14:21.676]  The music sets the tone.
[03:14:21.676 --> 03:14:23.458]  There's all that video editing.
[03:14:23.458 --> 03:14:24.518]  You can't trust
[03:14:25.279 --> 03:14:28.523]  The mainstream media anymore because they edit all their videos.
[03:14:28.523 --> 03:14:31.926]  Everything that they, and you see that they don't trust it.
[03:14:31.926 --> 03:14:38.253]  Because whenever James O'Keefe releases a video, suddenly the media goes, oh my god, how can you trust the edited videos from James O'Keefe?
[03:14:38.253 --> 03:14:42.537]  How can we trust edited video from the fake news media?
[03:14:42.537 --> 03:14:45.460]  Katie Tour, I believe it was, correct me if I'm wrong,
[03:14:46.281 --> 03:14:51.864]  But one of these big anchors selectively edited a documentary involving gun owners.
[03:14:51.864 --> 03:14:55.605]  And they had to... I don't think it was... It was a very famous anchor.
[03:14:55.605 --> 03:15:01.988]  I don't want to... Unlike the fake news media, I don't make accusations unless I know for sure who the right person is.
[03:15:01.988 --> 03:15:04.770]  But they definitely... Katie Couric, rather.
[03:15:05.410 --> 03:15:06.091]  We're good to go.
[03:15:31.474 --> 03:15:35.119]  And then three or four days later, when everybody's moved on, they go, oopsie.
[03:15:35.119 --> 03:15:35.539]  Oopsie.
[03:15:35.539 --> 03:15:42.428]  We'll put a correction all the way at the very bottom of the paragraph after it isn't live anymore.
[03:15:42.428 --> 03:15:49.338]  But real media, real journalism, like on InfoWars and like you get from Alex and Owen and David and me and so many others on the program.
[03:15:49.998 --> 03:15:51.299]  Right away in real time.
[03:15:51.299 --> 03:15:53.041]  We're always like, let's make sure we get it right.
[03:15:53.041 --> 03:15:54.762]  Let's make sure we get the story right.
[03:15:54.762 --> 03:15:57.645]  We don't want to spread fake news like CNN.
[03:15:57.645 --> 03:16:04.691]  We don't want to spread fake news like the New York Times and the Washington Post and CNN firing people only because they're threatened by lawsuits.
[03:16:04.691 --> 03:16:06.773]  You know, we definitely want to get it right.
[03:16:06.773 --> 03:16:08.474]  And that is why we go live.
[03:16:09.295 --> 03:16:09.895]  All the time.
[03:16:09.895 --> 03:16:11.476]  Right now, I'm live.
[03:16:11.476 --> 03:16:13.236]  You can't fake this.
[03:16:13.236 --> 03:16:16.398]  You can't fake the way I feel, the way I look, the way I act, the way I talk.
[03:16:16.398 --> 03:16:19.599]  There's no hair, you know, hair and makeup crew cutting everything together.
[03:16:19.599 --> 03:16:27.922]  When I interview somebody, you can't take one question over here and one answer over there and splice them together from unrelated parts of the conversation.
[03:16:28.582 --> 03:16:34.650]  It's all, and that is why the fake news media is terrified of us and why they want to take us down.
[03:16:34.650 --> 03:16:39.296]  And because CNN, again, they just published that article one minute before we went live.
[03:16:39.296 --> 03:16:41.799]  So I don't, I don't even think it's been loaded yet in the production.
[03:16:42.888 --> 03:16:44.890]  They are freaking out.
[03:16:44.890 --> 03:16:49.193]  They want to create the fake news narrative about conspiracy theories involving Russia.
[03:16:49.193 --> 03:16:56.999]  And then we can create these videos and these responses that are actually more factual and more truthful and more compelling.
[03:16:56.999 --> 03:16:58.740]  They get read by millions more people.
[03:16:58.740 --> 03:17:00.342]  And then we take them out.
[03:17:00.342 --> 03:17:02.783]  And that's, of course, why they won't debate, too.
[03:17:02.783 --> 03:17:05.165]  And they won't ever admit with the wrong.
[03:17:05.165 --> 03:17:06.086]  I'll give you a great example.
[03:17:06.847 --> 03:17:12.730]  I said this, I came up with this idea, I was talking to Alex, I think it was last Friday, Brian Stelter has still ignored me.
[03:17:12.730 --> 03:17:22.114]  Brian Stelter works at CNN, he has a show called Unreliable Sources, and what he does is goes and says that it's so tough to be a journalist.
[03:17:22.114 --> 03:17:29.498]  Oh my god, CNN, this is terrible, journalists are unsafe, blah blah blah, crying all day.
[03:17:29.498 --> 03:17:33.460]  Adult men and adult women crying because people call them mean names.
[03:17:34.900 --> 03:17:37.742]  They've actually never had a real job before, obviously.
[03:17:37.742 --> 03:17:40.324]  Working customer service is what I always tell people.
[03:17:40.324 --> 03:17:43.486]  And then you can tell me how tough your precious little job is in the media.
[03:17:43.486 --> 03:17:56.996]  But I told Brian Stelter, I will donate $100,000, and this is a sincere offer, I will donate $100,000 to whatever charity he selects, and he will go into New York and wear a MAGA hat, Make America Great Again hat, with a GoPro.
[03:17:57.842 --> 03:17:58.182]  Right?
[03:17:58.182 --> 03:18:00.063]  And just walk around.
[03:18:00.063 --> 03:18:04.066]  If you think it's so dangerous to be in CNN, I'll go wear a CNN hat.
[03:18:04.066 --> 03:18:06.668]  I'll go into New York, anywhere Brian wants.
[03:18:06.668 --> 03:18:09.189]  I'll walk right next to him and I'll wear a CNN hat.
[03:18:09.189 --> 03:18:12.251]  And he can wear a Trump hat, a Make America Great Again hat.
[03:18:12.251 --> 03:18:14.993]  And then he can see what really happens and film it.
[03:18:14.993 --> 03:18:16.834]  A hundred thousand for charity.
[03:18:16.834 --> 03:18:17.734]  Story went viral.
[03:18:17.734 --> 03:18:20.096]  It's been covered by IGR.com.
[03:18:20.096 --> 03:18:21.937]  It's been covered all over the internet.
[03:18:21.937 --> 03:18:22.697]  Video is crazy.
[03:18:22.697 --> 03:18:23.278]  He's ignoring it.
[03:18:23.278 --> 03:18:26.600]  Brian wants to pretend like the offer wasn't even made.
[03:18:27.262 --> 03:18:28.403]  That's how fake they are.
[03:18:28.403 --> 03:18:34.785]  They get on camera and say, oh my god, journalism is under attack, journalists are under attack.
[03:18:34.785 --> 03:18:36.246]  What about Trump supporters?
[03:18:36.246 --> 03:18:40.607]  Why will the fake news media not cover violence against Trump supporters?
[03:18:40.607 --> 03:18:46.070]  Violence against female Trump supporters, violence against male Trump supporters, old ones, elderly people.
[03:18:46.070 --> 03:18:53.653]  There was a picture once, it was probably the most appalling thing I've seen on the internet, other than, you know, gore and all that really, you know, nasty stuff.
[03:18:53.653 --> 03:18:53.993]  But I mean,
[03:18:54.813 --> 03:18:58.134]  Nasty in the depraved sociopathic sense.
[03:18:58.134 --> 03:19:10.018]  A liberal, quote, journalist, verified Twitter account, saw a picture of a 70-year-old man who'd been knocked unconscious and pepper sprayed by Antifa, and the man had done nothing wrong.
[03:19:10.018 --> 03:19:15.620]  He tweeted out, this is what happens when you think real life is like Twitter.
[03:19:16.567 --> 03:19:20.952]  And I thought to myself, a 70-year-old man is not doing... This is how... Yeah, exactly.
[03:19:20.952 --> 03:19:23.194]  This is how depraved these people are.
[03:19:23.194 --> 03:19:27.099]  That you can be a 70-year-old man, a 70-year-old woman, it doesn't matter.
[03:19:27.099 --> 03:19:28.420]  You're fair game.
[03:19:28.420 --> 03:19:29.922]  You're a target.
[03:19:29.922 --> 03:19:33.105]  Merely because you have a Make America Great Again hat.
[03:19:33.105 --> 03:19:37.891]  But Brian Stelter and all these people want to cry all day about how hard it is to be a journalist.
[03:19:38.704 --> 03:19:44.990]  And in the next segment, I'm getting to more of that because there's a couple more hit pieces on me that are coming that are actually interesting.
[03:19:44.990 --> 03:19:48.453]  And it's going to show you... I like to take you behind the scenes.
[03:19:48.453 --> 03:19:50.375]  Journalism on journalism.
[03:19:50.375 --> 03:19:55.100]  To not just tell you whatever story they're telling you, but how do these stories get made.
[03:19:55.100 --> 03:19:57.141]  So we're going to get into that in the next segment.
[03:19:57.141 --> 03:19:58.603]  Can't wait to talk to you in a few minutes.
[03:20:01.127 --> 03:20:07.551]  This is an announcement for all people who want to take a risk-free challenge to whiten their teeth in five minutes.

[03:24:25.668 --> 03:24:30.670]  Making tears or whatever you want to call it from Brian Stelter of Unreliable Sources.
[03:24:30.670 --> 03:24:33.631]  So let's call this segment how to kill
[03:24:34.386 --> 03:24:39.211]  Well, I don't want to use the word kill, even though the Washington Post said, how to kill Fox and Friends.
[03:24:39.211 --> 03:24:43.875]  So apparently, you know, you have to be real careful, tipsy tour around journalists, whatever you say.
[03:24:43.875 --> 03:24:49.681]  But if you're the Washington Post, you can write an article called How to Kill Fox and Friends.
[03:24:49.681 --> 03:24:50.782]  That's OK.
[03:24:50.782 --> 03:24:54.966]  But if but if we you know, we use any kind of language at all, you know, we're trying to incite violence or whatever.
[03:24:55.726 --> 03:24:59.029]  So let's just call this segment, How to Beat Alex Jones.
[03:24:59.029 --> 03:25:00.771]  How to Beat Mike Cernovich.
[03:25:00.771 --> 03:25:02.452]  How can CNN do that?
[03:25:02.452 --> 03:25:03.313]  I'll tell you why.
[03:25:03.313 --> 03:25:06.996]  The big reveal won't surprise the people listening in here.
[03:25:06.996 --> 03:25:10.479]  Brian Stelter apparently talked to somebody in Iowa.
[03:25:10.479 --> 03:25:17.826]  And the person sent a message to him and said, I just thought you might want to know conservative friends here in Iowa are very angry at the media.
[03:25:18.539 --> 03:25:25.232]  They think the Trump-Russian deal is a coup attempt by the media and don't think there's anything to the Russia-Trump emails.
[03:25:25.232 --> 03:25:29.420]  They don't understand why the media is trying to oust our duly elected president.
[03:25:29.420 --> 03:25:31.023]  They think there is a double standard.
[03:25:31.599 --> 03:25:36.061]  Why isn't anyone investigating the Clinton campaign's Russia connections?
[03:25:36.061 --> 03:25:38.983]  They are standing firm behind Trump.
[03:25:38.983 --> 03:25:42.144]  The double standard is really the crucial language here.
[03:25:42.144 --> 03:25:44.385]  It's something I talk about all the time.
[03:25:44.385 --> 03:25:49.388]  The reason people like me are rising, the people like Alex, who was already big.
[03:25:49.388 --> 03:25:50.929]  I didn't think Alex Jones, he's so big.
[03:25:50.929 --> 03:25:54.290]  I didn't think, how do you become more of a superstar than Alex was, right?
[03:25:54.290 --> 03:25:57.132]  But he's become even more stratospheric rise.
[03:25:57.132 --> 03:25:57.712]  Hard to believe.
[03:25:58.775 --> 03:25:59.875]  I'll tell you why.
[03:25:59.875 --> 03:26:02.176]  People are tired of the double standards.
[03:26:02.176 --> 03:26:08.257]  If CNN wants to beat Infowars, or wants to beat me, or wants to beat alternative media, why don't they just tell the truth?
[03:26:08.257 --> 03:26:11.778]  Why don't they tell the truth about violence against Trump supporters?
[03:26:11.778 --> 03:26:16.839]  Why don't they tell the truth that it isn't hate crimes being committed by Trump supporters?
[03:26:16.839 --> 03:26:18.400]  Those are all hoaxes.
[03:26:18.400 --> 03:26:21.800]  Those, you know, the swastikas and everything, they're painted backwards.
[03:26:21.800 --> 03:26:23.521]  There was a poop swastika, that was fake.
[03:26:24.341 --> 03:26:29.544]  There was a recent settlement with the man who had been falsely accused of rape by Mattress Girl.
[03:26:29.544 --> 03:26:31.446]  Columbia University ruined the guy's life.
[03:26:31.446 --> 03:26:33.207]  He sued Columbia University.
[03:26:33.207 --> 03:26:35.428]  Got a settlement offer there.
[03:26:35.428 --> 03:26:37.709]  Why doesn't the media just tell the truth?
[03:26:37.709 --> 03:26:39.811]  Why do they consistently apply double standards?
[03:26:39.811 --> 03:26:41.312]  Because I've talked to people from CNN.
[03:26:41.312 --> 03:26:43.193]  I'm friendly with some people who are at the network.
[03:26:44.424 --> 03:26:53.667]  And I told them, I go, look, if I turn on CNN, where can I watch a special on violence against Trump supporters?
[03:26:53.667 --> 03:26:57.768]  Where can I watch a special on the Clinton won uranium deal?
[03:26:57.768 --> 03:27:05.451]  Where can I watch a special about how Ukrainian oligarchs, billionaires pay people to go on to the media like Doug Schoen?
[03:27:06.201 --> 03:27:14.065]  They pay him, you know, $20,000-$40,000 a month to go on and agitate for war against Russia and then none of the news outlets disclose it.
[03:27:14.065 --> 03:27:17.927]  Where can I hear people being held to the same standard?
[03:27:17.927 --> 03:27:31.455]  And the reason that double standard line stood up for me is I had a very, at first heated, but then it became a more sensible conversation, we'll see what the story looks like, a hit piece of planning on me, at the Columbia Journalism Review.
[03:27:31.455 --> 03:27:31.915]  And he goes,
[03:27:33.194 --> 03:27:37.178]  Mike, you wrote this article on Andrew Kaczynski.
[03:27:37.178 --> 03:27:41.041]  And because you wrote the article, people are saying mean tweets about him.
[03:27:41.041 --> 03:27:48.108]  Do you feel that you're responsible for what people say to Andrew Kaczynski because you do journalism?
[03:27:48.108 --> 03:27:51.091]  And I go, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[03:27:51.846 --> 03:27:55.787]  So journalists are responsible for if people read your coverage.
[03:27:55.787 --> 03:27:59.668]  Journalists are not responsible for what anybody does if my coverage is true.
[03:27:59.668 --> 03:28:03.589]  I asked him, I said, when have you asked that question of a liberal reporter?
[03:28:03.589 --> 03:28:11.471]  When have you asked somebody who works at CNN, hey you work at CNN and you wrote an article about this guy and he lost his job.
[03:28:11.471 --> 03:28:13.372]  Is that responsible?
[03:28:13.372 --> 03:28:14.412]  Can you do that?
[03:28:14.412 --> 03:28:16.052]  Is that ethical?
[03:28:16.052 --> 03:28:17.333]  They'll never do that.
[03:28:17.333 --> 03:28:17.913]  But on me,
[03:28:19.230 --> 03:28:21.551]  They want to apply a double standard.
[03:28:21.551 --> 03:28:33.736]  On me, they want to say, well, Cernovich wrote an article about Andrew Kaczynski, even though I told the truth that he had led a hate mob against Justin Sacco, who received a lot of rape threats.
[03:28:33.736 --> 03:28:36.417]  Sam Biddle of Gawker, well, Gawker doesn't exist anymore.
[03:28:37.057 --> 03:28:49.907]  Sam Biddle, who's a loser blogger at Gawker, and Andrew Kozinski, who was in a BuzzFeed, created that whole online shaming hate mob against Justin Sacco, a private citizen who made a dumb ironic joke that was taken out of context.
[03:28:49.907 --> 03:28:50.588]  Her life is ruined!
[03:28:51.468 --> 03:28:55.230]  Well, why don't people ask him, hey Andrew, do you feel bad, bro?
[03:28:55.230 --> 03:29:02.595]  You feel bad that you dug up some tweet and you took it out of context and you made a private citizen world famous?
[03:29:02.595 --> 03:29:04.696]  Does that make you feel guilty?
[03:29:04.696 --> 03:29:06.357]  You ruined a person's life?
[03:29:06.357 --> 03:29:07.618]  You led a harassment mob?
[03:29:07.618 --> 03:29:09.439]  Do you feel bad about that?
[03:29:09.439 --> 03:29:18.145]  Hey Andrew, do you feel bad that you falsely accused a man of being a suspect of the Boston bombing?
[03:29:18.145 --> 03:29:19.666]  Do you feel bad, Andrew,
[03:29:20.402 --> 03:29:32.466]  That when the family was trying to find their son who had been lost and ultimately committed suicide, do you feel bad that you drudged up things that were untrue?
[03:29:32.466 --> 03:29:34.107]  And that's what the family had to see.
[03:29:34.107 --> 03:29:36.007]  Do you feel bad?
[03:29:36.007 --> 03:29:43.470]  Why will Columbia Journalism Review not do an article on fake news, the K-File spread, or the hate mob that he spread?
[03:29:43.470 --> 03:29:45.771]  The double standard is unacceptable.
[03:29:45.771 --> 03:29:46.771]  We're not going to stand for it.
[03:29:46.771 --> 03:29:48.372]  We're going to keep fighting back.
[03:29:48.372 --> 03:29:48.972]  Talk to you soon.
[03:29:50.208 --> 03:29:54.139]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.139 --> 03:29:56.807]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.178 --> 03:30:11.646]  It was Thomas Jefferson who once said that our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction to wit, by consolidation of power first and then corruption its necessary consequence.
[03:30:11.646 --> 03:30:19.032]  Jefferson was warning us about the global elite, the 1% of the 1%, consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government.
[03:30:19.032 --> 03:30:20.994]  Unfortunately, we didn't heed his advice.
[03:30:20.994 --> 03:30:27.039]  We now live in a neo-feudalistic society in which we're treated as indentured servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment.
[03:30:27.239 --> 03:30:34.748]  Political office no longer represents the voice of the people, but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance into the aristocracy.
[03:30:34.748 --> 03:30:42.337]  Simply put, we the people are responsible for civilization and culture, yet we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments around the world.
[03:30:42.557 --> 03:30:50.843]  We falsely believe that everything is simply black and white, one extreme against the other, conservative versus liberal, but things will change once more of us realize this truth.
[03:30:50.843 --> 03:30:58.149]  As Thomas Jefferson also said, enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.
[03:30:58.149 --> 03:31:00.611]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com
[03:31:00.951 --> 03:31:10.038]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:31:10.038 --> 03:31:18.185]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:18.425 --> 03:31:23.309]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:23.309 --> 03:31:30.094]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:30.094 --> 03:31:37.279]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:37.279 --> 03:31:44.144]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:44.284 --> 03:31:48.769]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:48.769 --> 03:31:52.173]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:31:52.173 --> 03:31:58.481]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:31:58.481 --> 03:32:00.143]  Available at Infowarslife.com
[03:32:02.342 --> 03:32:06.124]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:32:06.124 --> 03:32:13.849]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:32:13.849 --> 03:32:22.494]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:32:22.494 --> 03:32:26.877]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:32:26.877 --> 03:32:29.098]  Pathenogens added to the food and water,
[03:32:29.258 --> 03:32:36.723]  ...into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:32:36.723 --> 03:32:40.146]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:32:40.146 --> 03:32:51.174]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:32:51.274 --> 03:32:54.176]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[03:32:54.176 --> 03:32:57.258]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[03:32:57.258 --> 03:33:06.245]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[03:33:06.245 --> 03:33:08.907]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:33:08.907 --> 03:33:11.149]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:11.149 --> 03:33:14.131]  And now, your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:33:18.169 --> 03:33:26.556]  A few thoughts now on what is arguably the most politically corrupt department in the history of the American government.
[03:33:26.556 --> 03:33:40.469]  I'm speaking, of course, of the Obama Justice Department, led by two attorneys general, Eric Holder, who ultimately became the first sitting cabinet officer ever to be cited for contempt of Congress.
[03:33:40.469 --> 03:33:45.133]  And his successor, who is working on matching his record, Loretta Lynch,
[03:33:45.896 --> 03:34:06.145]  She, according to the fire director of the FBI, obstructed justice in ordering James Comey to refer to the Clinton email investigation as a matter rather than an investigation for the purpose of allowing the Clinton campaign to deny the Democratic nominee was under federal investigation.
[03:34:06.866 --> 03:34:12.831]  Today, we learned of the prospect of additional corruption on the part of the Obama Justice Department.
[03:34:12.831 --> 03:34:25.582]  At issue, why Attorney General Lynch went to almost unprecedented lengths to permit a Russian attorney to enter the country without a visa, long before meeting Donald Trump Jr.
[03:34:25.582 --> 03:34:27.704]  and Jared Kushner.
[03:34:27.704 --> 03:34:31.687]  Not the first scandal to plague that agency, of course.
[03:34:31.687 --> 03:34:34.590]  This meeting took place on June 9th of last year.
[03:34:35.336 --> 03:34:38.939]  But it is unclear now not only why A.G.
[03:34:38.939 --> 03:34:42.341]  Lynch would have given her an extraordinary waiver of U.S.
[03:34:42.341 --> 03:34:54.229]  immigration laws, but how that Russian attorney could have been in the country some five months after the expiration of that so-called immigration parole waiver.
[03:34:54.229 --> 03:35:01.714]  The Senate Judiciary Committee is now investigating Lynch's efforts to protect Hillary Clinton and the role of not only A.G.
[03:35:01.714 --> 03:35:04.196]  Lynch, but the fired FBI director as well.
[03:35:05.157 --> 03:35:12.561]  There is much to learn about the collusion between the Russian attorney and the Obama administration.
[03:35:12.561 --> 03:35:18.684]  But the political motivations of the Obama Department of Justice are readily recognized.
[03:35:18.684 --> 03:35:22.246]  It is all, all about partisan politics.
[03:35:22.246 --> 03:35:31.271]  In fact, of the more than $400,000 in donations to Clinton and Trump during the election from DOJ employees, 97% of their money
[03:35:34.008 --> 03:35:37.349]  Point to Hillary Clinton.
[03:35:37.349 --> 03:35:38.550]  Lou Dobbs is great.
[03:35:38.550 --> 03:35:46.253]  He's one of the best journalists working today, the best commentators working today, and that's the kind of information that you're going to rarely find.
[03:35:46.253 --> 03:35:51.816]  And that's, of course, where people attack Lou Dobbs so much, even though he has an impeccable track record.
[03:35:51.816 --> 03:36:00.540]  There's so much corruption in the Department of Justice that Jason Chaffetz from the House of Representatives actually replied to Trump's Twitter and said,
[03:36:01.340 --> 03:36:05.361]  Why are you not, why is your Department of Justice not prosecuting people?
[03:36:05.361 --> 03:36:06.921]  This was an amazing thing.
[03:36:06.921 --> 03:36:10.002]  I don't think there's ever been anything like this in the history of the world.
[03:36:10.002 --> 03:36:16.603]  Trump had tweeted out something about Hillary Clinton and Chaffetz said, well, why don't you just prosecute them?
[03:36:16.603 --> 03:36:17.503]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[03:36:17.503 --> 03:36:20.724]  Because I have inside sources at the highest level of DOJ.
[03:36:20.724 --> 03:36:22.704]  You can't hire anybody.
[03:36:22.704 --> 03:36:30.226]  If you try to hire anybody who actually wants to hold the Hillary Clintons, the Clinton family accountable under the law, you'll never get a job.
[03:36:30.826 --> 03:36:34.795]  But look at how many people the Special Prosecutor Mueller has hired.
[03:36:34.795 --> 03:36:41.529]  Why is it that the Special Prosecutor whose job is to conduct a witch hunt on low-level government employees
[03:36:42.409 --> 03:36:44.330]  Why is he hiring new people all the time?
[03:36:44.330 --> 03:36:45.691]  Taxpayers, we're going to have to pay that.
[03:36:45.691 --> 03:36:47.553]  We're going to have to pay that bill.
[03:36:47.553 --> 03:36:53.857]  Why is Fox News and CNN and Washington Post and New York Times not talking about how much that's going to cost taxpayers?
[03:36:53.857 --> 03:36:58.981]  Ken Starr billed something around $50 million to investigate Bill Clinton.
[03:36:58.981 --> 03:37:00.542]  And again, Bill Clinton's a bad guy.
[03:37:00.542 --> 03:37:02.083]  I'm not going to be here to defend Bill Clinton.
[03:37:02.683 --> 03:37:08.684]  But what they got Bill Clinton for and impeached him for wasn't even the subject of the investigation.
[03:37:08.684 --> 03:37:10.305]  It was a completely unrelated matter.
[03:37:10.305 --> 03:37:12.545]  $50 million.
[03:37:12.545 --> 03:37:18.687]  He asked me $50 million in taxpayer money for that kind of sideshow might not be the best use of our money.
[03:37:18.687 --> 03:37:21.867]  So how many hundreds of millions, because think about how much, and they like Clinton.
[03:37:21.867 --> 03:37:25.868]  So imagine how many hundreds of millions of dollars they're going to spend to go after Trump.
[03:37:25.868 --> 03:37:28.409]  And more importantly, low level employees.
[03:37:29.524 --> 03:37:33.106]  Nobody wants to talk about that, how much that's going to cost.
[03:37:33.106 --> 03:37:44.293]  Nobody wants to talk about why the Department of Justice cannot hire competent people because Johnny DeStefano, who's head of personnel and head of hiring, kills anything.
[03:37:44.293 --> 03:37:51.097]  The running joke now in the White House, and this is serious, this is what people say, this isn't me thinking, oh, this is funny.
[03:37:51.097 --> 03:37:58.342]  They go, the only way to get hired in the Department of Justice at the White House is to have tweeted, never Trump.
[03:37:59.448 --> 03:38:01.109]  This is the reality.
[03:38:01.109 --> 03:38:03.732]  Rent's previous Chief of Staff, why is he allowing this?
[03:38:03.732 --> 03:38:06.994]  Johnny DeStefano, why hasn't he been fired?
[03:38:06.994 --> 03:38:10.457]  Why is the Department of Justice not hiring prosecutors to go after them?
[03:38:10.457 --> 03:38:16.682]  James Comey, you'll remember, there was a great article, I think they called him Clinton's bag man.
[03:38:16.682 --> 03:38:17.863]  That was Comey.
[03:38:17.863 --> 03:38:25.730]  Comey cleared her and any kind of investigation that ever came up in her life or Bill's life, he completely cleared her.
[03:38:25.730 --> 03:38:28.052]  Loretta Lynch, why isn't she in prison?
[03:38:28.973 --> 03:38:30.134]  Susan Rice?
[03:38:30.134 --> 03:38:36.182]  Why hasn't she been prosecuted for violating the law for spying on American citizens?
[03:38:36.182 --> 03:38:36.923]  None of that.
[03:38:36.923 --> 03:38:39.506]  In fact, the media wants to pretend that Susan Rice doesn't exist.
[03:38:39.506 --> 03:38:41.148]  Remember?
[03:38:41.148 --> 03:38:41.969]  Susan Rice said...
[03:38:43.297 --> 03:38:44.918]  I didn't unmask anybody.
[03:38:44.918 --> 03:38:46.218]  PBS goes, okay.
[03:38:46.218 --> 03:38:47.599]  Then she got busted.
[03:38:47.599 --> 03:38:50.661]  And then everybody had her on the next day and they didn't even ask her.
[03:38:50.661 --> 03:38:52.602]  Hey, lie to her face.
[03:38:52.602 --> 03:38:57.004]  There was no outrage and outcry in the media about how Susan Rice had lied to them.
[03:38:57.004 --> 03:38:59.845]  They didn't say, oh, this is alternative facts.
[03:38:59.845 --> 03:39:01.686]  And Susan Rice was spreading alternative facts.
[03:39:01.686 --> 03:39:05.088]  No, they want to pretend like it didn't happen.
[03:39:05.088 --> 03:39:09.950]  And then of course the media narrative turns to, oh, people don't like Susan Rice because she's a woman.
[03:39:11.074 --> 03:39:12.055]  Oh, she's a victim now.
[03:39:12.055 --> 03:39:21.962]  I love how these powerful people, people at the highest level of government, are victims now.
[03:39:21.962 --> 03:39:24.785]  Foreign Policy, for example, did the same thing with me.
[03:39:24.785 --> 03:39:28.768]  They wrote an article about me and they quoted people who had been at the CIA for three decades.
[03:39:28.768 --> 03:39:31.770]  Alex and I talked about this, I think, Monday.
[03:39:31.770 --> 03:39:33.071]  And they made me out to be a bully.
[03:39:33.826 --> 03:39:38.549]  They go, people in the CIA are afraid of my... I'm sorry, I'm laughing.
[03:39:38.549 --> 03:39:41.530]  That is how absurd it truly is.
[03:39:41.530 --> 03:39:43.992]  People in the CIA are afraid of Mike Cernovich.
[03:39:43.992 --> 03:39:44.212]  Why?
[03:39:44.212 --> 03:39:45.713]  Because I do journalism?
[03:39:45.713 --> 03:39:47.014]  Because I tell the truth?
[03:39:47.014 --> 03:39:52.196]  And by the way, foreign policy, that was done in conjunction with Just Security.
[03:39:52.196 --> 03:39:59.541]  And if you go to Just Security's website, justsecurity.org, and you look at who funds it, our good friend George Soros does.
[03:39:59.541 --> 03:40:00.281]  Just Security.
[03:40:00.281 --> 03:40:03.383]  So that hit piece on me was actually funded by George Soros.
[03:40:04.485 --> 03:40:07.346]  That's why when people tell you, it's all connected.
[03:40:07.346 --> 03:40:14.648]  George Soros is finding hit pieces on me, and then these hit pieces, they're claiming, oh, I'm going after civil servants.
[03:40:14.648 --> 03:40:17.289]  People in the CIA now, that's what you call them?
[03:40:17.289 --> 03:40:23.071]  People with badges and guns and power, the ability to spy on American citizens?
[03:40:23.071 --> 03:40:27.193]  Those are just humble civil servants, like a mailman or something?
[03:40:28.469 --> 03:40:31.871]  That's where the narrative is shifting, and that's what they're doing.
[03:40:31.871 --> 03:40:33.252]  And our media is frivolous.
[03:40:33.252 --> 03:40:39.196]  There is a meme that kind of spread, and I now call it... Two Scoops.
[03:40:39.196 --> 03:40:45.359]  It's called the CNN's Two Scoops of Journalism and Excellence in Journalism Award.
[03:40:45.359 --> 03:40:51.463]  That becomes the chorus from CNN's report that Donald Trump, when he... God, this is so dumb.
[03:40:51.463 --> 03:40:53.104]  These people are so dumb.
[03:40:53.104 --> 03:40:54.265]  The media world that we live in,
[03:40:55.234 --> 03:41:01.379]  Is all Russia conspiracy theory and then complete and total stupidity instead of talking about real issues.
[03:41:01.379 --> 03:41:06.323]  So you'll all remember Donald Trump had, he's a regular at Trump Hotel because he owns it.
[03:41:06.323 --> 03:41:07.964]  He has dinner with people.
[03:41:07.964 --> 03:41:11.107]  Dessert arrives and everybody gets the typical dessert.
[03:41:11.107 --> 03:41:14.009]  But because the people know Trump, they give him two scoops of ice cream.
[03:41:14.009 --> 03:41:14.790]  They give him an extra scoop.
[03:41:15.450 --> 03:41:17.331]  That was a whole special on CNN.
[03:41:17.331 --> 03:41:19.573]  So we call that two-scoops journalism.
[03:41:19.573 --> 03:41:31.821]  So Chris Clizio, or however you say his name, I'm giving him the two-scoops award in journalism for this clip of Trump and Macron shaking hands.
[03:41:31.821 --> 03:41:35.803]  So if you go to Chris Clizio's Twitter, I don't know how to say these people's names.
[03:41:35.803 --> 03:41:37.064]  I don't talk to them.
[03:41:37.064 --> 03:41:38.585]  That's the great thing about being an outsider.
[03:41:38.585 --> 03:41:39.286]  A lot of people go,
[03:41:40.265 --> 03:41:44.847]  Cernovich, do you deliberately mispronounce people's names or you just don't know?
[03:41:44.847 --> 03:41:48.929]  I'm such an outsider, and I don't watch cable news, and I'm such an outsider.
[03:41:48.929 --> 03:41:50.490]  I don't talk to these people.
[03:41:50.490 --> 03:41:51.991]  I don't schmooze with them.
[03:41:51.991 --> 03:41:53.852]  I don't go to cocktail parties with them in DC.
[03:41:53.852 --> 03:41:55.713]  When I'm in DC, I just meet with the people.
[03:41:56.522 --> 03:41:57.403]  So I'm out in California.
[03:41:57.403 --> 03:42:00.684]  I don't even know how to pronounce the guy's name.
[03:42:00.684 --> 03:42:06.828]  But he does a second by second analysis of the handshake between Trump and Macron.
[03:42:06.828 --> 03:42:09.770]  So let's see if we can find that on his Twitter.
[03:42:09.770 --> 03:42:12.611]  He wrote an article on it too, on CNN.
[03:42:12.611 --> 03:42:17.234]  So as you know, a video surfaced of Trump and Macron shaking hands.
[03:42:17.234 --> 03:42:24.398]  And I think they shook hands for like 30 seconds because they were in some kind of like alpha male contest and Macron played a hand.
[03:42:25.886 --> 03:42:28.868]  Again, this is CNN.
[03:42:28.868 --> 03:42:30.389]  This is what they do.
[03:42:30.389 --> 03:42:34.812]  CNN doesn't want to do real journalism.
[03:42:34.812 --> 03:42:45.239]  So what they do is they pay some guy, Chris Colosio, $200,000 to do a second-by-second analysis of the Trump-Macron handshake.
[03:42:45.239 --> 03:42:47.320]  That's what CNN does.
[03:42:47.320 --> 03:42:48.701]  It's like a goofy thing.
[03:42:48.701 --> 03:42:52.344]  So actually, you know, my video crew made a really funny video.
[03:42:52.344 --> 03:42:52.804]  It's funny.
[03:42:53.644 --> 03:42:53.804]  Right?
[03:42:53.804 --> 03:42:54.625]  You watch it.
[03:42:54.625 --> 03:42:55.485]  It's a funny thing.
[03:42:55.485 --> 03:43:00.628]  They're shaking hands and you can tell Macron is trying to play like alpha male games with them and won't let go.
[03:43:00.628 --> 03:43:03.530]  So then Trump thinks, well, hey, you did this to me last time.
[03:43:03.530 --> 03:43:07.252]  So how about I not let you do it to me again?
[03:43:07.252 --> 03:43:09.233]  But then CNN, that's what the guy does.
[03:43:09.233 --> 03:43:10.534]  He's live blogging a handshake.
[03:43:11.638 --> 03:43:15.139]  When they're not talking about handshakes, they're talking about two scoops of ice cream.
[03:43:15.139 --> 03:43:28.322]  When they're not talking about two scoops of ice cream, they're talking about a Reddit user posting a GIF and how they're going to blackmail a Reddit user into not posting GIFs about them anymore, and they'll dox them if you post another GIF.
[03:43:28.322 --> 03:43:31.123]  This is a $20 billion corporation!
[03:43:31.123 --> 03:43:33.884]  What has happened to journalism in America?
[03:43:34.651 --> 03:43:39.415]  Where they find it newsworthy how many scoops of ice cream President Trump eats.
[03:43:39.415 --> 03:43:44.079]  And how, you know, many seconds he shook somebody's hands.
[03:43:44.079 --> 03:43:51.905]  And they care about gifts of Trump and CNN and pro-wrestling.
[03:43:51.905 --> 03:43:53.626]  They're utterly frivolous.
[03:43:53.626 --> 03:43:55.768]  That is, of course, why we're all growing.
[03:43:55.768 --> 03:43:59.031]  And for us to keep growing, we do need your support.
[03:43:59.031 --> 03:44:02.373]  And right now there is a massive, massive 30% special
[03:44:04.435 --> 03:44:08.919]  At InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:08.919 --> 03:44:11.462]  Brainforce is now 30% off.
[03:44:11.462 --> 03:44:13.363]  Supermail Vitality is 30% off.
[03:44:13.363 --> 03:44:15.285]  Survival Shield is 30% off.
[03:44:15.285 --> 03:44:22.392]  It is the big July extravaganza, the big July sale, 30% off all these products.
[03:44:22.392 --> 03:44:27.917]  Because you remember, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, this is a self-funded operation.
[03:44:28.517 --> 03:44:29.639]  That they're running.
[03:44:29.639 --> 03:44:30.240]  I've been there.
[03:44:30.240 --> 03:44:31.743]  It's an impressive operation.
[03:44:31.743 --> 03:44:32.985]  It's better than CNN.
[03:44:32.985 --> 03:44:35.168]  And they do real journalism.
[03:44:35.168 --> 03:44:38.133]  Now sure, we joke around.
[03:44:38.133 --> 03:44:39.255]  We goof off.
[03:44:39.255 --> 03:44:40.597]  Alex goofs off.
[03:44:40.597 --> 03:44:41.278]  We have fun.
[03:44:41.278 --> 03:44:42.581]  It doesn't mean we don't have fun.
[03:44:43.484 --> 03:44:46.725]  But we do real journalism, we break real news, we break real stories.
[03:44:46.725 --> 03:44:49.665]  Remember the Susan Rice unmasking scandal?
[03:44:49.665 --> 03:44:50.805]  I broke that.
[03:44:50.805 --> 03:44:52.246]  Here I am on InfoWars.
[03:44:52.246 --> 03:44:53.846]  CNN didn't break that story.
[03:44:53.846 --> 03:44:55.186]  New York Times didn't break that story.
[03:44:55.186 --> 03:44:56.367]  Washington Post didn't break it.
[03:44:56.367 --> 03:44:57.667]  Bloomberg didn't break it.
[03:44:57.667 --> 03:44:59.027]  Boston Globe didn't break it.
[03:44:59.027 --> 03:45:00.407]  LA Times, right here I broke it.
[03:45:00.407 --> 03:45:02.368]  Mike Cernovich who works with InfoWars.
[03:45:02.368 --> 03:45:05.408]  That's what you're getting when you support the story.
[03:45:05.408 --> 03:45:08.409]  You're getting original journalism, hard-hitting reporting,
[03:45:09.318 --> 03:45:17.036]  And when we talk about the ice cream and we talk about the handshakes and we talk about the fun stuff, we laugh and we have a good time.
[03:45:17.036 --> 03:45:17.537]  We don't do it.
[03:45:17.537 --> 03:45:18.038]  Here's what they do.
[03:45:18.038 --> 03:45:18.239]  They go.
[03:45:19.699 --> 03:45:24.403]  Oh my God, Trump, he had two scoops of ice cream and his guests only had one scoop?
[03:45:24.403 --> 03:45:27.225]  This proves that Trump is a pathological narcissist.
[03:45:27.225 --> 03:45:30.007]  Here is our panel of five people of psychologists.
[03:45:30.007 --> 03:45:35.772]  Hey, will you opine about Trump just having two scoops of ice cream and everybody else has one scoop?
[03:45:35.772 --> 03:45:37.833]  Evidence, mental illness and mental history.
[03:45:37.833 --> 03:45:41.236]  And then all these doctors opine about it.
[03:45:41.236 --> 03:45:47.241]  But then when at Infowars and I report that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson's disease as diagnosed by a physician.
[03:45:48.359 --> 03:45:51.242]  They go, well, how dare you diagnose somebody?
[03:45:51.242 --> 03:45:56.108]  You can't have a doctor diagnose somebody that the doctor has never treated.
[03:45:56.108 --> 03:46:03.136]  You can't have a doctor look at observable treatment and observable history and diagnose a person.
[03:46:03.136 --> 03:46:04.238]  You can't do that.
[03:46:04.238 --> 03:46:07.902]  But then the very next segment, they'll say, OK, well, Trump had two scoops of ice cream.
[03:46:08.823 --> 03:46:18.088]  Less really bad, maybe he's a narcissist, you know, we'll have all these doctors come on and diagnose him and figure it out, or maybe he's going to get diabetes with extra ice cream or whatever.
[03:46:18.088 --> 03:46:18.528]  That's CNN.
[03:46:18.528 --> 03:46:22.250]  You know how much of a profit they're going to make a year?
[03:46:22.250 --> 03:46:26.952]  When I tell you this, you're not going to believe it, because I didn't believe it when I read this.
[03:46:26.952 --> 03:46:31.814]  The AT&T-Time Warner merger valued CNN at $20 billion.
[03:46:35.302 --> 03:46:39.444]  Again, this is real news, not fake news.
[03:46:39.444 --> 03:46:40.404]  This is real news.
[03:46:40.404 --> 03:46:43.285]  When I read the number, I didn't believe it, so I had to fact check it.
[03:46:43.285 --> 03:46:47.967]  The Time Warner AT&T merger valued CNN at $20 billion.
[03:46:47.967 --> 03:46:54.029]  This is a $20 billion mega behemoth international corporate conglomerate.
[03:46:54.029 --> 03:46:56.250]  They're going to make, this year, $1 billion in profit.
[03:46:59.253 --> 03:47:01.134]  One billion dollars in profit.
[03:47:01.134 --> 03:47:11.461]  If Infowars had one billion dollars for one year in profit, the operation would grow by ten times and it would be self-funded and perpetually.
[03:47:11.461 --> 03:47:12.562]  You wouldn't need it to ever do it again.
[03:47:13.922 --> 03:47:14.762]  And perpetuity.
[03:47:14.762 --> 03:47:16.403]  There you go.
[03:47:16.403 --> 03:47:19.444]  You would not even need to ever raise any money again.
[03:47:19.444 --> 03:47:21.305]  So CNN is going to have $1 billion.
[03:47:21.305 --> 03:47:22.785]  What's that money going to do?
[03:47:22.785 --> 03:47:33.909]  Bloated offices, bloated salaries, paying people like Chris Colizio, you know, $500,000 a year to analyze Donald Trump's ice cream habits, to analyze his handshaking.
[03:47:33.909 --> 03:47:34.789]  There's no real news.
[03:47:34.789 --> 03:47:37.590]  They're not out actually breaking news.
[03:47:37.590 --> 03:47:39.971]  You never see them at the riots.
[03:47:39.971 --> 03:47:40.971]  Where were they with Antifa?
[03:47:41.730 --> 03:47:43.131]  You never see them on the streets.
[03:47:43.131 --> 03:47:45.212]  I marched with the protesters at the DNC.
[03:47:45.212 --> 03:47:48.653]  10 miles, I marched in 100 degree heat.
[03:47:48.653 --> 03:47:49.554]  Didn't see CNN.
[03:47:49.554 --> 03:47:50.394]  They weren't there.
[03:47:50.394 --> 03:47:54.756]  They weren't covering the truth about Bernie Sanders supporters.
[03:47:54.756 --> 03:48:03.380]  In fact, that's actually why, it's one thing that Megyn Kelly and the fake news media will never tell you, a lot of people who are maybe, quote unquote, left wing,
[03:48:04.378 --> 03:48:13.435]  Are watching InfoWars right now and are listening to InfoWars because they want real news and they want alternative news and they want alternative media and during the election
[03:48:14.235 --> 03:48:18.997]  They go, wait a minute, we're having a protest of 15,000 people at the DNC.
[03:48:18.997 --> 03:48:24.258]  But when we turn on CNN, the whole headline is, DNC unites around Hillary Clinton.
[03:48:24.258 --> 03:48:24.979]  She's amazing.
[03:48:24.979 --> 03:48:25.559]  She's great.
[03:48:25.559 --> 03:48:26.959]  Everybody loves Hillary.
[03:48:26.959 --> 03:48:29.540]  While outside, everybody's talking about WikiLeaks.
[03:48:29.540 --> 03:48:33.482]  Big, huge, massive pushback against the DNC.
[03:48:33.482 --> 03:48:34.262]  So if you're a liberal,
[03:48:35.140 --> 03:48:39.261]  You turn on our left winger and you turn on the TV, you don't see the truth.
[03:48:39.261 --> 03:48:41.322]  They're not showing those big protests.
[03:48:41.322 --> 03:48:44.423]  Fox News finally, or Fox Business did finally after a couple days.
[03:48:44.423 --> 03:48:50.585]  Lou Dobbs did, because again, Lou Dobbs that we had earlier is a legitimate journalist and a legitimate reporter.
[03:48:50.585 --> 03:48:52.705]  Megyn Kelly's not covering that kind of stuff.
[03:48:52.705 --> 03:48:54.746]  Jay Tapper's not kind of covering that stuff.
[03:48:54.746 --> 03:48:58.307]  They all work with a narrative, a fake news narrative.
[03:48:58.307 --> 03:49:04.649]  Speaking of which, WikiLeaks released an email that people had had before, but it became relevant again.
[03:49:05.771 --> 03:49:09.293]  Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 by Russia.
[03:49:09.293 --> 03:49:15.415]  Bloomberg, I believe, was going to report on the story and they, PR people quote, killed the story.
[03:49:15.415 --> 03:49:18.777]  How are they killing these stories?
[03:49:18.777 --> 03:49:31.423]  Bill Clinton got $500,000 for Russia to give a one hour speech and then of course that $500,000 doesn't include how he flies out there on private jets and all the women and prostitutes and everything that he has in there.
[03:49:32.563 --> 03:49:33.704]  That doesn't include any of that.
[03:49:33.704 --> 03:49:38.869]  So yeah, Hillary Clinton's campaign killed a story linking opposing sanctions and Bill Clinton paid $500,000.
[03:49:38.869 --> 03:49:42.492]  How were they able to kill these kind of stories?
[03:49:42.492 --> 03:49:44.373]  Who killed that story?
[03:49:44.373 --> 03:49:46.095]  What what quote-unquote journalist had it?
[03:49:46.095 --> 03:49:47.976]  Well, I'll tell you how he killed the story.
[03:49:47.976 --> 03:49:54.062]  This is something people don't know and this is why I love doing journalism on journalism.
[03:49:54.062 --> 03:49:56.384]  What happened is the quote reporter
[03:49:57.418 --> 03:50:14.415]  Who had that story, was gonna run it, and then Hillary Clinton's people go, well hey, how about if you don't run it, we'll give you an interview with Hillary, or we'll give you an interview with John Podesta, or we'll give you an interview with Omar, somebody, it's called access journalism.
[03:50:14.415 --> 03:50:20.801]  They traded a favor so that guy, that journalist, killed the story, which was true, high impact.
[03:50:21.748 --> 03:50:25.870]  All true, but it would also hurt Hillary, so he probably didn't want to publish it anyway.
[03:50:25.870 --> 03:50:32.612]  That's another dirty secret, is when they find stories critical of the Clintons, they don't even want to publish it, they're looking for a way out.
[03:50:32.612 --> 03:50:35.493]  What he did was he took a quid pro quo, took a bribe.
[03:50:35.493 --> 03:50:46.637]  He said, okay, well I'll kill this story, but what I want is an interview with Hillary Clinton, or Bill, or Uma, or maybe Chelsea, and I want a little bit of puff piece, and I'll give you what you want.
[03:50:47.308 --> 03:50:48.891]  That's what you get in the mainstream media.
[03:50:48.891 --> 03:50:51.335]  InfoWars is where you get real media.
[03:50:51.335 --> 03:50:53.058]  We don't make those kind of deals.
[03:50:53.058 --> 03:50:54.020]  We do journalism.

[03:52:13.275 --> 03:52:15.756]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds.

[03:54:15.460 --> 03:54:18.362]  And now, your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:54:20.101 --> 03:54:21.822]  And we're back for the final segment.
[03:54:21.822 --> 03:54:28.366]  Mike Cernovich, facebook.com forward slash Mike Cernovich here to talk to you about some breaking news.
[03:54:28.366 --> 03:54:38.032]  Brad Parscale, who ran Trump's Facebook team, social media team, analytics team, is now being subpoenaed to testify before Congress.
[03:54:38.032 --> 03:54:39.613]  They want him to testify.
[03:54:39.613 --> 03:54:41.454]  So Brad actually tweeted out again.
[03:54:41.454 --> 03:54:42.455]  This is breaking news.
[03:54:42.455 --> 03:54:44.276]  So we're pulling it out.
[03:54:44.276 --> 03:54:49.299]  Brad says, I'm unaware of any Russian involvement in the digital and data operations of the Trump campaign.
[03:54:50.040 --> 03:54:56.262]  The only collaboration I'm aware of in the Trump digital campaign was with staff provided the campaign by Facebook, Google, and Twitter.
[03:54:56.262 --> 03:55:04.765]  Those experts in digital marketing worked side-by-side with his firm, the RNC, and Cambridge Analytica to run a professional winning campaign.
[03:55:04.765 --> 03:55:06.205]  But he's going to talk to him anyway.
[03:55:06.205 --> 03:55:07.706]  So this is the importance of you
[03:55:08.446 --> 03:55:11.129]  Listening in, everybody wants to know how to support people.
[03:55:11.129 --> 03:55:20.037]  You can, of course, support the InfoWars by going to InfoWarsLife.com and taking advantage of the great 30% off specials for July.
[03:55:20.037 --> 03:55:24.862]  It's a July super sale, big event, 30% off all your favorite products.
[03:55:24.862 --> 03:55:31.969]  Well, at least all of my favorite products, especially Brain Force, Alpha Male Vitality, Super Male Vitality, Survival Shield,
[03:55:32.709 --> 03:55:34.191]  Big, big, special deal.
[03:55:34.191 --> 03:55:39.275]  So that is one way that you can support the InfoWars and fund the operation.
[03:55:39.275 --> 03:55:43.238]  But maybe people don't take the supplements, although I always say buy the toothpaste.
[03:55:43.238 --> 03:55:47.622]  My answer to people who say, well, I don't want the supplements, is I go, well, everybody uses toothpaste.
[03:55:47.622 --> 03:55:49.844]  Just buy the toothpaste and get on an auto ship.
[03:55:49.844 --> 03:55:51.546]  Things like that add up.
[03:55:51.546 --> 03:55:52.927]  They add up big time.
[03:55:52.927 --> 03:55:55.289]  But another thing you can do, and this is why
[03:55:56.178 --> 03:55:57.639]  The fake news media is freaking out.
[03:55:57.639 --> 03:55:59.000]  Share the links.
[03:55:59.000 --> 03:56:00.942]  Share the links on social media.
[03:56:00.942 --> 03:56:02.783]  Share the links on Twitter, YouTube.
[03:56:02.783 --> 03:56:03.364]  Clip them.
[03:56:03.364 --> 03:56:04.325]  Cut them.
[03:56:04.325 --> 03:56:05.145]  Edit them.
[03:56:05.145 --> 03:56:06.046]  Make them happen.
[03:56:06.046 --> 03:56:11.710]  I have some crazy Facebook links from my own page from the past week.
[03:56:11.710 --> 03:56:17.755]  The numbers were so crazy, but like I've told people, anybody who doubts them, I'll show them.
[03:56:17.755 --> 03:56:21.538]  72 million people reached last week.
[03:56:21.538 --> 03:56:21.898]  One week.
[03:56:23.300 --> 03:56:26.145]  Facebook.com forward slash Mike Cernovich.

[03:56:38.711 --> 03:56:40.871]  We're doing all these hits, right?
[03:56:40.871 --> 03:56:44.272]  So that's why that's why the fake news media is freaking out.
[03:56:44.272 --> 03:56:47.333]  They think they're Russian robots behind all this.
[03:56:47.333 --> 03:56:48.733]  They can't understand that.
[03:56:48.733 --> 03:56:51.274]  No, we actually know how to engage with people.
[03:56:51.274 --> 03:56:52.934]  We don't talk down to people.
[03:56:52.934 --> 03:56:55.015]  We don't lecture our viewers and listeners.
[03:56:55.015 --> 03:56:56.335]  We don't treat people with disdain.
[03:56:57.095 --> 03:57:04.262]  So one very important thing, and that's why again they're trying to get that Brad Parscale, they're trying to call him in like, well, how is it that Trump did such a good job?
[03:57:04.262 --> 03:57:05.924]  Clearly he had Russian robots.
[03:57:05.924 --> 03:57:07.606]  We don't need any of that.
[03:57:07.606 --> 03:57:13.291]  We didn't need Russia to run Twitter, to run Facebook, to run YouTube, to run everything.
[03:57:13.291 --> 03:57:18.877]  These streams that Alex has on his YouTube, a lot of times they do 10,000 simultaneous viewers.
[03:57:19.497 --> 03:57:21.739]  Simultaneous, non-stop, 10,000, 20,000.
[03:57:21.739 --> 03:57:26.863]  When Alex Jones went on the Joe Rogan podcast, that was the biggest.
[03:57:26.863 --> 03:57:29.064]  The Guinness Book of World Records was certified, actually.
[03:57:29.064 --> 03:57:30.185]  Alex should.
[03:57:30.185 --> 03:57:33.628]  If I were Alex, I would tell the Guinness Book of World Records they should certify it.
[03:57:33.628 --> 03:57:38.031]  The biggest podcast, most downloaded podcast of all time.
[03:57:38.031 --> 03:57:40.933]  At one point in the podcast, 50,000 live views.
[03:57:40.933 --> 03:57:43.575]  That's a stadium.
[03:57:43.575 --> 03:57:48.599]  That's the kind of numbers that we're bringing, Alex is bringing, because of you!
[03:57:49.426 --> 03:57:50.566]  Listening in.
[03:57:50.566 --> 03:57:52.727]  People say, I want to join the Info Wars.
[03:57:52.727 --> 03:57:54.188]  I want to make things happen.
[03:57:54.188 --> 03:57:55.628]  That's how you make it happen.
[03:57:55.628 --> 03:57:56.509]  You share the links.
[03:57:56.509 --> 03:58:00.610]  Every time you share the links, you're firing a shot at evil.
[03:58:00.610 --> 03:58:02.571]  You're firing a shot for the good guys.
[03:58:02.571 --> 03:58:07.653]  Yeah, the Joe Rogan one, 4.5 million views just on the YouTube.
[03:58:07.653 --> 03:58:09.914]  That doesn't count the iTunes downloads.
[03:58:09.914 --> 03:58:13.295]  That doesn't count all the channels that reposted it and downloaded it.
[03:58:13.295 --> 03:58:15.576]  That thing was probably heard by 30 million people.
[03:58:16.425 --> 03:58:19.266]  Nobody in media is getting those kind of ratings.
[03:58:19.266 --> 03:58:20.987]  That's because of you.
[03:58:20.987 --> 03:58:21.947]  Those of you listening.
[03:58:21.947 --> 03:58:29.650]  So, you can of course buy the toothpaste, the oral hygiene products, the mouthwash, the supplements at NFLWorldsLife.com.
[03:58:29.650 --> 03:58:34.132]  But if that isn't your thing, you want to do something else, keep sharing the links.
[03:58:34.132 --> 03:58:36.093]  You are part of the resistance.
[03:58:36.093 --> 03:58:37.933]  Fire those shots at evil.
[03:58:37.933 --> 03:58:38.994]  Thank you again for watching.
[03:58:38.994 --> 03:58:39.874]  This is Mike Cernovich.
