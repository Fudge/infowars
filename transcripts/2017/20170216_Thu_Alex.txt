[00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:18.193]  In the age of wonder.
[00:00:18.193 --> 00:00:20.318]  Another world.
[00:00:20.318 --> 00:00:21.039]  Another time.
[00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:28.479]  It's Thursday, February 16th, 2017.
[00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:33.703]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and you notice that if you're a TV viewer, the background is flamethrower, radioactive red.
[00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:59.387]  And that's because that's where our world's headed under globalism.
[00:00:59.387 --> 00:01:11.103]  You know, I saw quite a few news articles the last week saying that I and Donald Trump and a bunch of other people, like Colonel Schaefer, you name it, are useful idiots of Vladimir Putin.
[00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:12.144]  No, let me explain what we are.
[00:01:13.174 --> 00:01:33.769]  We're nationalists that want our country back and we don't want to be poor and be under the New World Order and watch families attacked all over the world and the family broken up and go under the technotronic technocracy that the New World Order publicly has put out in thousands of communiques, papers, books, statements.
[00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:54.282]  And you may have a big, giant group of people so dumbed down, they want to be slaves, want to go along with this, but a large portion of the globe, of every color, of every region, of every religion, understands the existential, total, complete threat that is the declared war on humanity that is the New World Order!
[00:01:59.383 --> 00:02:17.817]  Before I even came in here and saw these articles this morning, I was going to come here and say, world government globalism is treason against humanity, and is a war against the nation-state, and a war against the individual, and a total corporate system of dominance of all life on Earth, not just people.
[00:02:17.817 --> 00:02:20.719]  It is an attempt to become God!
[00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:25.283]  But all of us have to fall for you to be God, don't we, globalists?
[00:02:27.403 --> 00:02:28.443]  Then I looked at the news.
[00:02:28.443 --> 00:02:31.824]  Le Pen has come out.
[00:02:31.824 --> 00:02:33.724]  Turbo-surging in the polls.
[00:02:33.724 --> 00:02:34.845]  Way ahead.
[00:02:34.845 --> 00:02:36.745]  Even in their polls in France.
[00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:38.265]  5, 10, 15 points ahead.
[00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:40.166]  That means she's 30 points ahead.
[00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:43.106]  The Islamicists are burning cities everywhere.
[00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:44.447]  And the media won't even say it.
[00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:49.728]  They got into central Paris, burning cars within hundreds of yards of the Eiffel Tower.
[00:02:51.357 --> 00:02:52.518]  And what did Le Pen say?
[00:02:52.518 --> 00:02:59.483]  And I've been telling you for decades, when you start hearing this from world leaders, it's the beginning of the end of the New World Order.
[00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:02.085]  You have to call it what it is.
[00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:06.008]  Le Pen, the euro is a weapon used against EU nation states.
[00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:07.549]  The founders of it said that.
[00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.511]  Le Pen, we will leave the EU to restore sovereignty.
[00:03:11.994 --> 00:03:21.280]  The State Department under rebellion and other CIA operatives that are globalist minions are saying she's a Russian agent and a traitor.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:38.292]  No, you are a globalist operative, Evan McMullin, who thought you would steal the electoral votes there in the state of Utah and that you and your little cult inside the CIA was going to dictate the future of this republic.
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.161]  And now they're going into full bully mode everywhere.
[00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:52.243]  Facebook, Twitter, Google are all announcing that they're going to turn loose the hate that calls for killing Trump.
[00:03:52.243 --> 00:03:56.364]  The censorship then will only expand against libertarians and conservatives.
[00:03:56.364 --> 00:03:57.565]  They're trying to force you.
[00:03:58.763 --> 00:04:04.929]  They're out of the fight in cyberspace to give up so they can create the illusion that they're about to overthrow Trump.
[00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:06.510]  But let me give you the good news.
[00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.812]  The American people have seen through it.
[00:04:08.812 --> 00:04:17.540]  And even in known cloaked polls by Rasmussen and Gallup and others, Trump has surged.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.181]  Yeah, how did he win the election at like 40 points?
[00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:20.262]  It was way ahead of that.
[00:04:20.262 --> 00:04:21.343]  Oh, he's 15 ahead.
[00:04:21.343 --> 00:04:23.786]  He has surged to 50 and now 55 today.
[00:04:26.587 --> 00:04:28.408]  What has all your bullying done?
[00:04:28.408 --> 00:04:30.888]  You've failed.
[00:04:30.888 --> 00:04:32.449]  All of you.
[00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.970]  And your armies of scum.
[00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.490]  You failed.
[00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.051]  And you're going to fail more.
[00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:39.551]  Oh, go ahead and kill Trump.
[00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:41.212]  You'll ensure our victory then.
[00:04:41.212 --> 00:04:45.393]  I hope you don't do it, for Trump's sake, but you're never going to win now.
[00:04:45.393 --> 00:04:46.314]  You're identified.
[00:04:47.159 --> 00:05:00.194]  So, the head of Facebook, Amazon, Zuckerberg, Google, all of you, you need to realize you failed and back off now before you push too far and then it goes into a hot war and you end up in ashes.
[00:05:00.194 --> 00:05:05.079]  In a protest against Donald Trump's tight citizenship policy, a day without immigrants has been declared nationwide.
[00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:10.622]  Today, February 16th, 2017 will go down in history as a day without immigrants.
[00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:11.343]  Look around you.
[00:05:11.343 --> 00:05:12.624]  Is that person an immigrant?
[00:05:12.624 --> 00:05:14.345]  Imagine if they were just gone.
[00:05:14.345 --> 00:05:15.185]  But wait a second.
[00:05:15.185 --> 00:05:17.347]  This ideal or illustration doesn't make sense.
[00:05:17.347 --> 00:05:19.128]  President Trump is not deporting immigrants.
[00:05:19.128 --> 00:05:22.650]  In fact, I'm yet to see or hear any policy that deals directly with just immigrants.
[00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.632]  So, are citizens of the U.S.
[00:05:24.632 --> 00:05:31.700]  that have immigrated here going to take off work in protest for those who want to skirt the legal process that they went through to be an immigrant?
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.842]  An interesting notion.
[00:05:32.842 --> 00:05:39.109]  Or will this just be a bunch of self-loathing white liberal college students and older women like usual in a desperate attempt to virtue signal against Trump?
[00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:43.694]  Or, will non-citizens show up and proudly announce that they work here illegally?
[00:05:43.694 --> 00:05:47.397]  The goal of this protest is to display how imperative immigrants are to society.
[00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:49.279]  Guess we will find that out real quick.
[00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:56.987]  Or, we will see that people who immigrated here came here to work for a better life and have better things to do than protest a process that they followed.
[00:05:56.987 --> 00:05:59.230]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.

[00:07:00.433 --> 00:07:01.994]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:07:01.994 --> 00:07:07.256]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[00:07:07.256 --> 00:07:10.458]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:16.261]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[00:07:16.261 --> 00:07:21.964]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house.
[00:07:22.384 --> 00:07:25.346]  Like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:30.910]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:37.955]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[00:07:37.955 --> 00:07:42.499]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.
[00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:46.060]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action.

[00:08:01.365 --> 00:08:07.367]  When I was coming from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[00:08:07.367 --> 00:08:10.888]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac,
[00:08:12.063 --> 00:08:17.624]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[00:08:17.624 --> 00:08:22.385]  He said, it's a long walk to Nashville, would you like to ride?
[00:08:22.385 --> 00:08:25.046]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:29.867]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:08:29.867 --> 00:08:33.628]  He sat down in the front seat, he turned on the radio.
[00:08:34.824 --> 00:08:39.025]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just kicked off the Thursday Global Broadcast.
[00:08:56.568 --> 00:09:07.755]  Already Thursday, the 16th day of February 2017, I am your host Alex Jones, and if you're a TV viewer, not a radio listener, you'll notice we got the background is nuclear red-orange.
[00:09:07.755 --> 00:09:18.721]  Because that's where this world's headed under globalism, with its system hell-bent on establishing a planetary, corporate-controlled technocracy that is completely anti-human.
[00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:21.223]  And I've said this thousands of times in the last
[00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:46.397]  15 years or so in my 20 years on air, that if we ever just hammer the fact from the Council on Foreign Relations, the Club of Rome, Bilderberg, Davos, their public statements about how they're going to establish a total world government, cut off resources, phase out populations, create animal-human clones, merge with machines and become gods, that people will say, you're not going to make those decisions for us.
[00:09:47.884 --> 00:09:54.886]  Now today you see it in the mainstream news about animal human clones and gene splicing and gene editing and it's, oh guess what?
[00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:57.507]  They're telling you it's been going on for decades.
[00:09:57.507 --> 00:09:59.608]  They're rolling everything out.
[00:09:59.608 --> 00:10:05.770]  Twitter's announcing, yeah we're going to start censoring conservatives and libertarians and Trump supporters.
[00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.571]  Twitter for two weeks won't let you see any positive comments for Trump.
[00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:10.451]  It's all negative.
[00:10:10.451 --> 00:10:13.272]  They're already controlling it and not letting his tweet get out to everybody.
[00:10:14.022 --> 00:10:16.664]  I mean, we're under mega assault.
[00:10:16.664 --> 00:10:19.426]  It's so naked.
[00:10:19.426 --> 00:10:23.629]  The bullying of the American people and others around the world is just over the top.
[00:10:23.629 --> 00:10:25.550]  And you know why I love DrudgeReport.com so much?
[00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:32.035]  Because it's not even posted articles, except when Drudge writes an article or puts out a news blurb, which might be like a couple times a week.
[00:10:34.071 --> 00:10:49.459]  It's just mainly government documents, video clips, mainstream news, but from the globalist perspective pushing tyranny, but he'll just put two or three links together showing how it's their agenda, and then he'll put another clip where they're denying it's happening.
[00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:50.920]  There is no global government.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.143]  Trump's insane, Jones is insane, Bannon's insane, Drudge is insane, and then all these articles.
[00:10:56.143 --> 00:10:57.504]  World government's in crisis.
[00:10:57.504 --> 00:10:59.065]  The answer to everything is world government.
[00:10:59.065 --> 00:11:01.086]  The answer is getting rid of families.
[00:11:01.086 --> 00:11:03.207]  You better merge with machines or be obsolete.
[00:11:04.278 --> 00:11:06.599]  Yeah, we're going to forcibly inoculate you.
[00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:11.920]  And don't listen to these crazies that say we're going to forcibly inoculate you.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.542]  And the President's not allowed to ever talk to the Russians, and none of his staff or diplomats are.
[00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:20.863]  Diplomats never talk to any foreign leaders, ever, on the phone or in person.
[00:11:20.863 --> 00:11:27.505]  It's illegal, and we've got secret recordings where Flynn lined up a phone call to the President-elect on December 15th.
[00:11:27.505 --> 00:11:28.926]  It's unbelievable!
[00:11:28.926 --> 00:11:32.767]  He said, I can't talk about sanctions, but the President says he wants to talk to you about them.
[00:11:37.745 --> 00:11:40.467]  It's like if somebody says, will you marry me?
[00:11:40.467 --> 00:11:41.668]  And you say, no.
[00:11:41.668 --> 00:11:43.409]  Then they say, oh, you said we're married.
[00:11:43.409 --> 00:11:45.130]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:58.860]  And they've got all these slimy, anti-American, globalist, collaborator, arrogant Brennan supporters, CIA people, on TV saying Trump's a domestic enemy, overthrow him, he's a Russian agent.
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.483]  I told you months ago they were gonna beat the drum up to this.
[00:12:02.483 --> 00:12:04.965]  It would have been too insane to say it months ago.
[00:12:04.965 --> 00:12:06.546]  They have to just by approximation
[00:12:07.512 --> 00:12:14.600]  It's a technique, enter it in, enter it in slowly and then just build it and build it and have congressional press conferences.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.942]  Evan McMullin, what a shame to this country.
[00:12:16.942 --> 00:12:18.424]  Look at that wimpy little egghead.
[00:12:18.424 --> 00:12:28.274]  We're going to play him right now on CNN, he's on other channels, saying that Trump's a domestic enemy.
[00:12:28.274 --> 00:12:29.835]  That's the quote, it's even worse than I was saying.
[00:12:30.948 --> 00:12:32.129]  A domestic enemy.
[00:12:32.129 --> 00:12:33.090]  I don't say domestic threat.
[00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.911]  See, I tend to dial stuff back.
[00:12:34.911 --> 00:12:51.663]  This is the elected president of the United States, a capitalist, someone that wants a free market to defend our borders and to cut our taxes, and who signed an executive order saying you don't have to pay $5,000 or these penalties if you don't get Obamacare and you don't have to fill it out.
[00:12:51.663 --> 00:12:52.464]  He killed that.
[00:12:53.533 --> 00:13:03.682]  And Congress made six Obamacare changes but won't make any for Trump because the enemy is the Republican establishment.
[00:13:03.682 --> 00:13:13.351]  And they're the ones on TV and everywhere giving aid and comfort to the Democrats and Soros trying to overthrow Trump right now and they mean business, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:13.351 --> 00:13:14.892]  They've mean business from day one.
[00:13:14.892 --> 00:13:16.614]  I've had a lot of people privately
[00:13:17.648 --> 00:13:23.893]  Say, okay Alex, you said they do all this and how did you know they do this exactly as they did it?
[00:13:23.893 --> 00:13:32.420]  Because quite frankly, even top policy wonks kind of study what other policy wonks are up to in little areas to be really on target in small specific areas.
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:37.504]  I study it all and I watch the patterns.
[00:13:37.504 --> 00:13:42.088]  And I see how they do different rollouts and I know their playbook.
[00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:56.403]  And so I'm telling you, they're going to ignite riots all over the US, burning cities just like in France right now, and they're going to keep saying it's all Trump's fault and bully and bully and bully and then implode the economy if they can.
[00:13:56.403 --> 00:14:10.172]  The good news is there's some patriots in the stock market and just general investors know business is open again and so it's surging even as the head of the Federal Reserve says it shouldn't be and that she wants to increase interest rates to kill that and Trump's removing her.
[00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:14.129]  And that's why they're flipping out the bankers.
[00:14:14.129 --> 00:14:16.290]  The bad bankers are getting thrown out.
[00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:20.232]  And Trump's going to the establishment saying, give me bankers that'll follow orders.
[00:14:20.232 --> 00:14:24.314]  I'll still let you guys be in charge, but you're not going to screw people anymore.
[00:14:24.314 --> 00:14:26.835]  He says, there's a big old juicy cornucopia here.
[00:14:26.835 --> 00:14:28.976]  There's a big old Thanksgiving table here.
[00:14:28.976 --> 00:14:36.420]  And I don't care if you're a poor black person or Hispanic American or a rich banker or whoever you are, we're going to start having an even playing field.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:40.542]  He's announced and told the Federal Reserve, you start loaning money to the local banks
[00:14:40.782 --> 00:14:46.445]  And they better start loaning it close to 0% to small businesses right now!
[00:14:46.445 --> 00:14:50.167]  You've had decades of sucking our tax money and giving yourself free money.
[00:14:50.167 --> 00:14:52.128]  You start giving it to them right now!
[00:14:53.251 --> 00:14:55.532]  I read the Banking Association reports.
[00:14:55.532 --> 00:14:56.733]  I cover them.
[00:14:56.733 --> 00:14:59.995]  Everything Trump's doing is what local banks have been calling for.
[00:14:59.995 --> 00:15:03.477]  You don't think Trump hadn't battled the banks his whole life and his daddy didn't battle them?
[00:15:03.477 --> 00:15:05.759]  You don't think he doesn't know their tricks better than they do?
[00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:09.701]  You don't think he doesn't want to break their parasitic backs?
[00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:11.522]  He's out for you.
[00:15:11.522 --> 00:15:12.403]  He's real.
[00:15:12.403 --> 00:15:13.804]  And that's why they're so upset.
[00:15:15.103 --> 00:15:19.564]  Even in their own CIA garbage reports, they admit, Russia, you better watch it.
[00:15:19.564 --> 00:15:27.947]  Trump's for real, and America's gonna be so powerful, you're gonna be absolutely overrun by it.
[00:15:27.947 --> 00:15:29.788]  They're like, you're globalist like us.
[00:15:29.788 --> 00:15:34.689]  You know, hey Putin, you got globalists in your offices, and Trump's gonna shut that down.
[00:15:34.689 --> 00:15:38.590]  That was the article, the Kremlin's starting to worry about Trump.
[00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:43.892]  Because yeah, if America turns back on, folks, nobody, economically, forget weapons, can stand in our way.
[00:15:45.097 --> 00:15:46.078]  And they go on to admit that.
[00:15:46.078 --> 00:15:59.927]  They say Trump's taking over the whole global system that we sucked out of America and that the globalists set up for themselves so the corporate guys can play God and ignore the people and tell us we can't have cars or medicine but they can have, you know, giant thousand acre ranches in Hawaii.
[00:16:01.516 --> 00:16:05.839]  And trillions of dollars at their disposal, and jet helicopters, and life extension.
[00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:06.639]  Listen!
[00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:08.440]  I'll quote Louis Farrakhan of the elite.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.062]  You're going to give us some of this dirt, or we're going to burn this sucker down.
[00:16:12.062 --> 00:16:12.943]  But here's the difference.
[00:16:12.943 --> 00:16:14.384]  We're going to burn it down politically.
[00:16:14.384 --> 00:16:24.309]  You're trying to get all the dumbed-down poor people of every race, color, and creed to run around and burn stuff, thinking because Trump's trying to get in the way of the goodies Hillary was going to give you.
[00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:28.172]  Hillary only gives you enough goodies to have you on the hook, like a fish.
[00:16:29.369 --> 00:16:30.610]  I'm skipping this break.
[00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.332]  Now, Drudge has it so laid out so perfectly.
[00:16:33.332 --> 00:16:36.414]  InfoWars has got some big stories too.
[00:16:36.414 --> 00:16:38.595]  I've been asking folks for four or five days to do a story on this.
[00:16:38.595 --> 00:16:39.856]  You can see they're blocking his Twitter.
[00:16:39.856 --> 00:16:41.177]  They admit they're blocking it.
[00:16:41.177 --> 00:16:42.598]  No one's even covering it.
[00:16:42.598 --> 00:16:56.827]  Paul's got an article coming out how they're blocking Trump in positive comments and the public's feedback to Trump so they don't have communication with him and so he doesn't see what the public's saying and so the tens of millions that see his Twitter only see their globalist brainwashing next to his comments.
[00:16:58.049 --> 00:17:00.131]  And this is the whole model of how they censor right now.
[00:17:00.131 --> 00:17:02.152]  But let's look at some of these headlines.
[00:17:02.152 --> 00:17:07.557]  Trump approval rating pops to 55%.
[00:17:07.557 --> 00:17:10.839]  Up 5 points in just the last week in the very same poll.
[00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:11.960]  And other polls show the same thing.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:18.245]  And that's in skewed polls, which are shooting for demographics that are more Democrat-Liberal.
[00:17:18.245 --> 00:17:23.269]  Meanwhile, Jack Attack, Twitter CEO, compares USA's mood to Arab Spring.
[00:17:23.269 --> 00:17:27.533]  Talks about the preparation for the left to overthrow the government.
[00:17:28.763 --> 00:17:31.926]  Reddy's crackdowns on conservative speech.
[00:17:31.926 --> 00:17:34.348]  This is their announcements.
[00:17:34.348 --> 00:17:37.051]  It's already happening.
[00:17:37.051 --> 00:17:38.612]  You understand, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:17:38.612 --> 00:17:42.956]  I mean, this is so massive.
[00:17:42.956 --> 00:17:50.383]  Meanwhile, 60% of refugees since Judge Holt's Trump order come from terror-prone countries.
[00:17:50.383 --> 00:17:53.326]  Christian University in Texas opens prayer room for Muslims.
[00:17:54.844 --> 00:17:55.965]  Congress crawl.
[00:17:55.965 --> 00:17:57.467]  Tax cuts stall.
[00:17:57.467 --> 00:17:59.749]  Obamacare for all.
[00:17:59.749 --> 00:18:00.751]  Winter slumber.
[00:18:00.751 --> 00:18:06.237]  Republicans passivity during first month of Trump.
[00:18:06.237 --> 00:18:09.320]  House passes six Obamacare repeals.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.603]  When Obama was president, now nothing.
[00:18:14.403 --> 00:18:18.024]  The Republicans wrote the parts they want to screw everybody over, and Trump isn't letting them do that.
[00:18:18.024 --> 00:18:25.905]  That's why he said in his inaugural speech, this isn't about Republican or Democrat, this is about putting power back to you, and sending wealth back to the area where it's produced.
[00:18:25.905 --> 00:18:27.105]  It's yours!
[00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:29.346]  We're not redistributing, we're letting you keep it!
[00:18:29.346 --> 00:18:31.746]  And we know you're the engine of prosperity.
[00:18:31.746 --> 00:18:33.627]  And the globalists have captured this country.
[00:18:33.627 --> 00:18:35.087]  They think they own it, they think they run it.
[00:18:35.087 --> 00:18:39.848]  They're the threat, they're the foreign multinational threat, not Russia on the verge of collapse.
[00:18:41.957 --> 00:18:45.379]  And they point at that, these enemies of the Republic.
[00:18:45.379 --> 00:18:50.121]  I mean, this guy is a literal enemy of the Republic.
[00:18:50.121 --> 00:18:55.504]  This Evan McMullin who tried to jackknife the entire election and tried to take over.
[00:18:55.504 --> 00:18:56.845]  I mean, look at this guy.
[00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:59.706]  They're always just total wimps.
[00:18:59.706 --> 00:19:03.068]  And these are the guys that send off the soldiers to fight and die.
[00:19:03.068 --> 00:19:08.471]  These are the guys in covert action commanding men 20 times the person they are.
[00:19:09.292 --> 00:19:16.010]  But they're little sniveling rats, so they're the ones all put in charge, and it's little dipsticks like this, and people like...
[00:19:17.085 --> 00:19:23.270]  Brennan, that Wahhabist that converted to Islam in Saudi Arabia, literally, and was a communist in college.
[00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:30.235]  This is the type of crap that they dredge up and tell us that we're not patriotic and I'm a useful idiot?
[00:19:30.235 --> 00:19:35.298]  Listen, dumbass, if Russia ever does anything to this country, I'm ready to go to war!
[00:19:35.298 --> 00:19:38.040]  I'm ready to go to war with you, because you've been screwing it over!
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.822]  You are the domestic enemy, scumbag!
[00:19:41.411 --> 00:19:43.492]  Look at that piece of crap!
[00:19:43.492 --> 00:19:46.013]  I can't believe Trump's putting up with your treason.
[00:19:46.013 --> 00:19:47.033]  I'm serious.
[00:19:47.033 --> 00:19:47.753]  Let me tell you something.
[00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:53.375]  The media's like, oh, Jones now loves the president and the federal government because he thinks he gets his way.
[00:19:53.375 --> 00:19:58.497]  This is one of the first American governments, just in the executive, we've had in a long time.
[00:19:58.497 --> 00:20:01.398]  I told you Trump's going to be 10 times Ronald Reagan.
[00:20:01.398 --> 00:20:03.259]  Everybody better watch out.
[00:20:03.259 --> 00:20:06.460]  Ronald Reagan doesn't hold a candle to what Trump's trying to do.
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.401]  And they shot him for what he was trying to do, and then they got control.
[00:20:12.762 --> 00:20:17.109]  And, you know, Dan Rather pops in over Trump's speeches and says it's a spigot of lies.
[00:20:17.109 --> 00:20:20.654]  You're a spigot of lies, you shameful person!
[00:20:20.654 --> 00:20:22.858]  Texas a shame, right here in Austin, Texas.
[00:20:22.858 --> 00:20:24.200]  What a sack of crap!
[00:20:25.629 --> 00:20:27.770]  So let's continue, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.431]  All these bullies think they can push us around all this stuff.
[00:20:31.431 --> 00:20:38.374]  They're the ones that have sold us out to NAFTA and GATT, the TPP, where a bunch of corporations take control of our government and it waives its rights.
[00:20:38.374 --> 00:20:44.876]  They tried to get Italy two months ago, or a month and a half ago, to vote to sign over its sovereignty?
[00:20:44.876 --> 00:20:45.576]  Completely?
[00:20:45.576 --> 00:20:50.178]  And accept a EU military and disband the Italian military?
[00:20:52.847 --> 00:21:02.442]  See, if Hitler would have just had a trade deal and been all cutesy about it in Europe, and, oh, and by the way, you know, a decade or so into it, oh, let us put some troops in after we got our president in, and then you just accept them coming in.
[00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.090]  This is treason.
[00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.451]  This is subterfuge.
[00:21:06.451 --> 00:21:08.771]  And people say, oh, well he's got Goldman Sachs in his administration.
[00:21:08.771 --> 00:21:11.372]  It's Goldman Sachs running the takeover of these countries.
[00:21:11.372 --> 00:21:12.993]  It's Goldman Sachs the globalist.
[00:21:12.993 --> 00:21:15.273]  That's why he brought key Goldman Sachs people in.
[00:21:15.273 --> 00:21:21.535]  And then the media goes, oh, well it's true, Goldman Sachs gave zero to Trump, all the money to Hillary, but why is Goldman Sachs stocks up?
[00:21:21.535 --> 00:21:24.496]  They want to control the market and siphon it off.
[00:21:24.496 --> 00:21:26.817]  They'd rather have it be smaller, but they dominate it.
[00:21:26.817 --> 00:21:33.059]  It's surged for everybody so much that they've seen their profits go up 30 plus percent in the last few months as well.
[00:21:34.482 --> 00:21:47.988]  There's even articles where some Goldman Sachs people are like, maybe this plan of peace is good and prosperity, maybe we just have trade, and still we can have all the weapons we want to, and maybe it's good to actually not make poor people poor, and maybe free market's the way to go.
[00:21:47.988 --> 00:21:49.149]  It does work really good.
[00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:54.171]  Nobody wants globalism except a few very evil people on the top.
[00:21:54.171 --> 00:21:56.452]  Because it's anti-prosperity.
[00:21:56.452 --> 00:22:01.335]  It was sold as pro-prosperity, and these people that get together in these confabs,
[00:22:04.161 --> 00:22:08.683]  Like Brennan that thinks he's God and tells the President, you better watch your mouth, close quote.
[00:22:08.683 --> 00:22:15.827]  They all get together and believe, like some employee, you've been away for a year and you come back and your employee thinks they own your company and run it, and you're like, you're fired!
[00:22:15.827 --> 00:22:17.348]  Get your butt out of here.
[00:22:17.348 --> 00:22:21.690]  People flip out, even in business and life, and start thinking they're your boss.
[00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.692]  This out of control, hijacked government is not your boss.
[00:22:25.692 --> 00:22:27.953]  And I know you know that, because even in their skewed polls.
[00:22:29.252 --> 00:22:34.994]  Internal polls, just like I told you before the election, internal polls have Trump at about 65% right now.
[00:22:34.994 --> 00:22:35.815]  Okay?
[00:22:35.815 --> 00:22:38.456]  You notice they've got him up at 55 in the mainline polls.
[00:22:38.456 --> 00:22:39.276]  He's going up.
[00:22:39.276 --> 00:22:42.777]  So even in their skewed polls, they've got him going up.
[00:22:42.777 --> 00:22:45.498]  And they are panicking because people are seeing through this.
[00:22:45.498 --> 00:22:51.781]  So you get this through your head, all of you, that think you own this country and you run it.
[00:22:51.781 --> 00:22:54.722]  You sit around calling people fighting for the life of this nation traitors.
[00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.231]  And you sit around with no pedigree, no background, no allegiance to this nation.
[00:23:00.231 --> 00:23:04.072]  All of you have been caught, like Brennan, selling out to foreign powers.
[00:23:04.072 --> 00:23:05.653]  You are the enemies.
[00:23:05.653 --> 00:23:10.214]  You are the clear and present danger to this republic.
[00:23:10.214 --> 00:23:15.196]  You are, using your term, domestic enemies.
[00:23:15.196 --> 00:23:16.296]  There can't be one or the other.
[00:23:16.296 --> 00:23:18.757]  Who's the real domestic enemy?
[00:23:18.757 --> 00:23:23.078]  Is it little chicken necks?
[00:23:23.078 --> 00:23:25.499]  It's a type they go for, a little wimp.
[00:23:27.116 --> 00:23:29.297]  A little potbelly.
[00:23:29.297 --> 00:23:30.017]  Look at him.
[00:23:30.017 --> 00:23:32.738]  Look at, look at, look at Hayden.
[00:23:32.738 --> 00:23:34.219]  Look at, uh, all of them.
[00:23:34.219 --> 00:23:37.981]  They all look like they came from the same daddy.
[00:23:37.981 --> 00:23:38.881]  And the same mommy.
[00:23:41.926 --> 00:23:42.847]  What is it?
[00:23:42.847 --> 00:23:44.869]  Because you can't get honorable men to do this.
[00:23:44.869 --> 00:23:46.511]  You've got to get little nobodies.
[00:23:46.511 --> 00:23:49.374]  And I don't mean people that are small or wimps on average.
[00:23:49.374 --> 00:23:53.939]  I'm saying it's a certain pastiche, you know, know-it-all little creature.
[00:23:53.939 --> 00:23:55.080]  Let's put him next to Hayden.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.901]  Can we do that?
[00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:57.783]  And then let's put Brennan up there as well.
[00:23:57.783 --> 00:24:00.466]  They're just all these creepy thugs.
[00:24:01.287 --> 00:24:10.953]  Allied with the big corporations and the media who still think they can beat America and beat the military and beat the patriots and the intelligence agencies that outnumber you.
[00:24:10.953 --> 00:24:12.914]  I'm going to be conservative 9 to 1.
[00:24:15.785 --> 00:24:18.847]  And again, you don't have any of the fighting men.
[00:24:18.847 --> 00:24:26.753]  People like you, anti-American, globalist, there aren't any fighting men that you've got that support you.
[00:24:26.753 --> 00:24:34.138]  You may be able to hire mercenaries and hire people to do stuff, and then they go home and commit suicide a month later when they carry out your will.
[00:24:34.138 --> 00:24:36.219]  So you don't have many of them left, do you, Hayden?
[00:24:36.219 --> 00:24:44.946]  Look at Hayden, and then look at his son, his mini-me, his creature, that thought he'd overturn the whole election, and then thought they'd block everything else.
[00:24:44.946 --> 00:24:45.346]  Look at him!
[00:24:46.954 --> 00:24:50.475]  Let's go back to the other one, because he has them shoot it down from the jaw to make him look tougher.
[00:24:50.475 --> 00:24:58.758]  Gosho McMullin, just on a straight-on shot like him, and it's one you were showing earlier, and it's literally the exact same shot.
[00:24:58.758 --> 00:24:59.558]  It's the same deal.
[00:24:59.558 --> 00:25:10.542]  They know better, and they're going to creep around, and they're going to control stuff, and they're going to go on CNN with like a couple hundred thousand viewers, and then they're going to tell you how the whole world works.
[00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:12.862]  Because they put their little grubby hands together.
[00:25:12.862 --> 00:25:14.743]  These guys are just
[00:25:16.263 --> 00:25:23.006]  Are just unbelievable egomaniacs who just think they own the country and are going along with globalism that is pure cancer.
[00:25:23.006 --> 00:25:29.429]  So let's go to Evan McMullin, Donald Trump is a domestic enemy on the Communist News Channel.
[00:25:29.429 --> 00:25:40.134]  But the fact that we know so much because of these leaks and these sources from our reporting or the Washington Post or wherever else, your former CIA, why are they so leaky?
[00:25:43.115 --> 00:25:46.016]  Well, I'll tell you what their concerns are.
[00:25:46.016 --> 00:26:00.103]  Their concerns are that Donald Trump presents or poses a threat to the country because of what they see in terms of his relationship with Vladimir Putin and the relationship of his team to other Russian intelligence officers or to Russian intelligence officers.
[00:26:00.103 --> 00:26:01.684]  These people, our people, our U.S.
[00:26:01.684 --> 00:26:04.926]  intelligence officers are deeply committed to our security.
[00:26:04.926 --> 00:26:09.328]  They risk their lives routinely for it overseas in war zones and otherwise.
[00:26:09.588 --> 00:26:09.868]  You did.
[00:26:09.868 --> 00:26:12.049]  And they see something happening with our U.S.
[00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:16.471]  President, and they have seen it playing out over time, that truly concerns them.
[00:26:16.471 --> 00:26:28.296]  So while leaking is illegal, their first responsibility, the oath that they take when they first start their service, requires them to defend the Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:26:28.336 --> 00:26:35.978]  Listen, I'm all for transparency, and if something nefarious has been going on, it should be reported out and there should be ramifications.
[00:26:35.978 --> 00:26:44.081]  But to the President's point, with these leaks, do you give him any leeway in saying that is correct, that there have been too many, too many leaks?
[00:26:44.681 --> 00:26:46.523]  Well, leaks are illegal.
[00:26:46.523 --> 00:26:50.486]  So he can make that complaint and I think it does have a certain validity.
[00:26:50.486 --> 00:27:01.594]  But again, I think intelligence officers are caught between the oath that they take when they start their service, which says they'll defend the country, they'll defend the Constitution from domestic and foreign enemies.
[00:27:01.594 --> 00:27:02.895]  Okay, so they see a risk here.
[00:27:02.895 --> 00:27:05.917]  They see a security threat coming from the White House.
[00:27:05.917 --> 00:27:07.038]  They're responding to that.
[00:27:08.601 --> 00:27:13.265]  A security threat coming from the White House, a domestic enemy.
[00:27:13.265 --> 00:27:30.822]  So, this guy didn't support WikiLeaks though, that was US intelligence showing pedophile garbage, foreign states, money, Hillary getting money from the Russians, talking about enslaving the public, talking about making us poor, tens of thousands of pages of just vomitous evil, where even mainline liberals had to turn against them.
[00:27:30.822 --> 00:27:33.545]  And, you know, even the London Guardian said, oh my God, this woman's pure evil.
[00:27:34.588 --> 00:27:51.001]  And then you turn that around, though, and say that the electronic surveillance on the President-elect, recording his National Security Advisor setting up phone calls for him to discuss things like sanctions, that that's espionage and we're Russian agents.
[00:27:51.001 --> 00:27:55.165]  I mean, this guy's declaring war on America.
[00:27:55.165 --> 00:28:01.170]  And again, these people sit there and they're so arrogant, they tell the President, you better watch your mouth.
[00:28:04.614 --> 00:28:06.416]  I think people like that need to watch their mouth.
[00:28:06.416 --> 00:28:08.978]  What do you think?
[00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:19.026]  I mean, you guys need to understand, you're starting something that anybody with half a brain historically understands you will not win unless you just blow the planet up.
[00:28:19.026 --> 00:28:22.549]  And I guess you're so satanic and so spoiled, maybe that's what you'll try to do.
[00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:25.371]  But people will probably stop you doing that too.
[00:28:25.371 --> 00:28:29.995]  So, I've never seen any of these guys that even looks like a man.
[00:28:29.995 --> 00:28:30.996]  And that ought to tell you something.
[00:28:31.732 --> 00:28:34.564]  Because a real man cares about their family and justice and the truth.
[00:28:37.898 --> 00:28:40.479]  These people aren't useful idiots of globalism.
[00:28:40.479 --> 00:28:41.559]  They're parasites.
[00:28:41.559 --> 00:28:54.925]  They're willing enemies of America and enemies of this republic, in my view, in historical research, who are openly overthrowing it and signing us over to a corporate, global, anti-human dictatorship that is working to destroy the nation-state and the family.
[00:28:54.925 --> 00:29:03.068]  And now, from Russia, to Brazil, to France, to the United States, to England, all over the world,
[00:29:03.968 --> 00:29:09.734]  People are saying, we want families, we want true justice, we want Americana.
[00:29:09.734 --> 00:29:19.063]  And all Americana means is just a big expression of success, and strength, and honor, and will, and trailblazing, and danger, and everything that comes with it.
[00:29:19.063 --> 00:29:23.387]  But just, you want it, you got it, barbarian will.
[00:29:23.387 --> 00:29:25.008]  Not a bunch of little chicken necks.
[00:29:25.008 --> 00:29:27.351]  You will not lead us into the future, boy.
[00:29:29.315 --> 00:29:34.657]  You got a bunch of boys that want to mount America's head on the wall as some trophy!
[00:29:34.657 --> 00:29:38.719]  Well, they sneak around, and as long as the giant sleeps, they win.
[00:29:38.719 --> 00:29:39.980]  But now they know.
[00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:43.561]  The giant is awakening.
[00:29:43.561 --> 00:29:49.624]  Key quotes from Le Pen about the wars we're winning straight ahead.
[00:29:49.624 --> 00:29:51.025]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.025 --> 00:29:53.566]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.566 --> 00:29:56.247]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.205 --> 00:30:06.910]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.972]  Dr. Griff, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:30:09.972 --> 00:30:15.576]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:30:15.576 --> 00:30:21.680]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.963]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:30:24.963 --> 00:30:26.424]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:30:26.624 --> 00:30:30.925]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:30:30.925 --> 00:30:33.866]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:30:33.866 --> 00:30:35.527]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:30:35.527 --> 00:30:38.968]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:30:38.968 --> 00:30:41.569]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:30:41.569 --> 00:30:42.629]  It's in powder form.
[00:30:42.629 --> 00:30:45.510]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.651]  I take this.
[00:30:46.651 --> 00:30:48.031]  This is the product that I take.
[00:30:48.031 --> 00:30:49.992]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.

[00:30:58.477 --> 00:31:02.779]  Hi, my name is John Kunkel.
[00:31:02.779 --> 00:31:04.060]  I'm 63 years of age.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:09.924]  I watched several YouTube videos of Stephen Hewer's and learned what supplements might help me with energy and weight loss.
[00:31:09.924 --> 00:31:16.508]  I've now been on Neandria's Black Cumin Seed Oil, Synergy One, and six other products from Synergistic Nutrition for several weeks now.
[00:31:16.508 --> 00:31:16.888]  I've lost
[00:31:17.248 --> 00:31:18.009]  10 pounds.
[00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:20.191]  My joint pain has been reduced significantly.
[00:31:20.191 --> 00:31:22.893]  I have a lot of energy that I never had before.
[00:31:22.893 --> 00:31:25.756]  My cravings for sweets are gone, and I'm rarely hungry.
[00:31:25.756 --> 00:31:29.799]  Even my cravings for foods like hamburgers and heavy carbohydrate meals are now gone.
[00:31:29.799 --> 00:31:31.481]  This is the only thing that's worked for me.
[00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:35.284]  I was seriously considering bariatric surgery, but that's out the window now.
[00:31:35.284 --> 00:31:37.286]  Thank you so much, Synergistic Nutrition.

[00:33:19.404 --> 00:33:21.926]  Let's roll in with this beautiful music.
[00:33:21.926 --> 00:33:24.127]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[00:33:24.127 --> 00:33:27.589]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:27.589 --> 00:33:31.051]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.051 --> 00:33:37.115]  The globalists are pouring their full will out, culturally, through the propaganda, but also spiritually.
[00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:39.456]  And they're spoiling for a fight.
[00:33:39.456 --> 00:33:40.277]  They already got one.
[00:33:40.277 --> 00:33:43.119]  We already are kicking their ass all over the planet.
[00:33:43.119 --> 00:33:45.660]  Their world government's gonna get torn into pieces.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.541]  Humanity's already got too many threats ahead of it.
[00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:47.981]  We probably
[00:33:49.042 --> 00:33:51.964]  May not survive already, even if we beat them.
[00:33:51.964 --> 00:33:54.106]  So they gotta be dealt with now.
[00:33:54.106 --> 00:34:00.991]  All the cowards, all the scum, all the backstabbers, all the vampires, all the pedos, they gotta be dealt with.
[00:34:00.991 --> 00:34:04.233]  Doesn't mean there won't still be some creepin' around.
[00:34:04.233 --> 00:34:06.355]  But they're not gonna be runnin' the show anymore.
[00:34:06.355 --> 00:34:16.622]  Oh man, you wanna fight, you're gonna get one.
[00:34:19.246 --> 00:34:27.490]  I don't want to lose my voice, but I just want you to know... I just want to beat these people, don't you?
[00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:29.711]  I'm sick of them!
[00:34:29.711 --> 00:34:33.552]  I'm sick of them thinking they're better than everybody and having their way with us.
[00:34:33.552 --> 00:34:37.154]  Having their way with a lot of good, hard-working people, you pieces of crap!
[00:34:47.898 --> 00:34:53.362]  Robert David Steele, formerly with the CIA, best-selling author, researcher, reviewer, he's going to be joining us.
[00:34:53.362 --> 00:34:56.984]  He's got big news on the pedophile roundup he wants to get into and why Flynn was taken out.
[00:34:59.124 --> 00:35:01.226]  And there is a big pedophile roundup going on around the country.
[00:35:01.226 --> 00:35:02.447]  I told you it was coming two months ago.
[00:35:02.447 --> 00:35:02.927]  You see it.
[00:35:02.927 --> 00:35:06.611]  They're rolling up the procurers, the Renfields right now.
[00:35:06.611 --> 00:35:09.053]  So that's the silent war against the globalists.
[00:35:09.053 --> 00:35:11.795]  That's why they're so pissed and so scared.
[00:35:11.795 --> 00:35:13.457]  And let's just get it all out in the open.
[00:35:13.457 --> 00:35:16.359]  Let's just, let's just, let's just crush them.
[00:35:16.359 --> 00:35:17.320]  They want to fight.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.202]  Let's just give them what they want.
[00:35:20.461 --> 00:35:29.447]  I don't mean a physical one, but they're trying to bully everybody back into their houses and offline, and you know, just Trump supporters thinking everything's okay and go to sleep.
[00:35:29.447 --> 00:35:39.293]  No, you need to be at city council meetings, county commission meetings, when your congress people come into town, you need to be there educating, informing, and be bold, and be strong, and be focused!
[00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:44.832]  Everybody always wanted to fight for the country and get it back from the New World Order.
[00:35:44.832 --> 00:35:47.054]  Well, this is it, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:35:47.054 --> 00:35:48.535]  This is what it looks like!
[00:35:48.535 --> 00:35:49.075]  You want it?
[00:35:49.075 --> 00:35:51.777]  A lot of people worked hard to get us to this point.
[00:35:51.777 --> 00:35:53.839]  Let me tell you the good news, though.
[00:35:53.839 --> 00:35:56.541]  This is a guarantee.
[00:35:56.541 --> 00:35:58.202]  They've already lost.
[00:35:58.202 --> 00:35:59.984]  They're going to try to wreck a lot of stuff in the process.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:09.006]  Again, if Hillary would have gotten in, it would have been even better, but that morally was wrong to do, because she might have started a nuclear war, and that was on the slate.
[00:36:09.006 --> 00:36:09.987]  That's a demon.
[00:36:09.987 --> 00:36:13.309]  He was looking for thermonuclear destruction.
[00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:15.270]  I pulled a photo of her from a few days ago with Bill.
[00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:18.233]  I mean, just evil incarnate.
[00:36:18.233 --> 00:36:19.734]  I mean, those people are creepozoids.
[00:36:21.408 --> 00:36:26.149]  But it would have been better for the overall total defeat of them.
[00:36:26.149 --> 00:36:39.893]  Just let them come in, let them expand Obamacare, break the middle class, rob everybody, have the schools say families are bad, teach five-year-olds how to give blowjobs, that's their openly teaching now, how to be a tranny, and just let them have their way for a while.
[00:36:39.893 --> 00:36:40.453]  But you know what?
[00:36:40.453 --> 00:36:41.713]  We gotta do the right thing.
[00:36:41.713 --> 00:36:45.794]  Just like Trump said, I could leave Obamacare in and have it really destroy the Democrats, but you know what?
[00:36:45.794 --> 00:36:47.115]  I'm gonna fight, and I'm gonna...
[00:36:48.075 --> 00:36:55.040]  Repeal it and I'm going to change it because it's hurting business owners and independent people and it's bankrupting this country.
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.382]  And Paul Ryan said, the hell you are, bro.
[00:36:58.382 --> 00:36:59.723]  Bring in the Russian spy stuff.
[00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:09.429]  Boy, I got an Eddie Munster haircut and twinkly little eyes and I think I'm better than America and everybody else.
[00:37:09.429 --> 00:37:27.196]  I'm just like all these other traitors and Eddie Haskell know-it-all psychopaths and I'm gonna mount America's head on the wall because I meet with all the big corporate chiefs and we feel sure we can beat America and beat the world and beat the French and beat the Germans and beat the Russians and beat the Japanese and beat everybody.
[00:37:27.196 --> 00:37:30.057]  But the truth is everybody under them wants out of it!
[00:37:31.092 --> 00:37:32.473]  And has been waiting for this moment!
[00:37:32.473 --> 00:37:37.358]  You're sitting on top of a volcano that's only rumbling right now!
[00:37:37.358 --> 00:37:42.563]  If you had any spiritual connection or discernment, you'd know all that, but you don't!
[00:37:42.563 --> 00:37:53.032]  Because you chose the side of selling everybody out, so you can be in a mansion, and drive a fancy car, and be around a bunch of other fake mummies!
[00:37:53.032 --> 00:37:56.555]  None of that has any value!
[00:37:56.555 --> 00:37:56.936]  Zero!
[00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:01.079]  I've got to get these clips.
[00:38:01.079 --> 00:38:03.801]  This is Le Pen.
[00:38:03.801 --> 00:38:17.514]  Her dad, a hero of World War II, when they came back here to take France back, a patriot, a nationalist, a guy involved with de Gaulle and people getting the sovereignty of France back and getting the nukes away from NATO that was going to just control France.
[00:38:17.514 --> 00:38:18.616]  People make fun of France all day.
[00:38:18.616 --> 00:38:20.477]  France has been through a lot.
[00:38:20.477 --> 00:38:23.720]  Half their male population died just in the Napoleonic Wars.
[00:38:24.645 --> 00:38:27.086]  Yeah, the French Revolution before that for a decade.
[00:38:27.086 --> 00:38:28.767]  I mean, France got its back broken.
[00:38:28.767 --> 00:38:30.087]  France wasn't losing wars before.
[00:38:30.087 --> 00:38:32.248]  It was one of the most warlike, aggressive countries in the world.
[00:38:32.248 --> 00:38:34.629]  People just finally, they killed all the men, basically.
[00:38:34.629 --> 00:38:40.032]  And I'm not saying there isn't some strong Frenchmen, but they killed, they all got killed out, folks.
[00:38:40.032 --> 00:38:43.533]  The only guys that hid out under the barn were left.
[00:38:43.533 --> 00:38:46.054]  You got in a battle with the French 200 years ago, 215 years ago, it wasn't fun.
[00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:58.054]  It's the French with the Norman that conquered England, but the whole issue here is that Le Pen is a great lady.
[00:38:58.054 --> 00:38:59.575]  I know people that know her well.
[00:38:59.575 --> 00:39:02.657]  They really care.
[00:39:02.657 --> 00:39:03.957]  She is battling Soros.
[00:39:03.957 --> 00:39:06.338]  She's leading Griggs for decades against him.
[00:39:06.338 --> 00:39:12.081]  She tried to stop the Islamic invasion, and now Paris is on fire, and other cities, six other cities are on fire.
[00:39:12.081 --> 00:39:15.843]  The heart of the city was on fire, and the news won't say it's Islamic!
[00:39:15.843 --> 00:39:16.363]  Nowhere!
[00:39:16.363 --> 00:39:17.184]  It's Islamic!
[00:39:17.904 --> 00:39:22.329]  They say, we think it started when some black guy got beat up by police from Africa, whatever.
[00:39:22.329 --> 00:39:24.731]  And then they never show the evidence of that.
[00:39:24.731 --> 00:39:29.877]  It is a bunch of third world giant populations led by the Islamicists, being directed by social media.
[00:39:29.877 --> 00:39:32.279]  They're allowed to organize on everything to somehow...
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.924]  Bully France into a further open border, and you go, that would get Le Pen elected.
[00:39:36.924 --> 00:39:37.584]  Well, no, no, no.
[00:39:37.584 --> 00:39:42.929]  They think they're just going to arrest her or steal the election and block her, and they're going to just continue to flood France.
[00:39:42.929 --> 00:39:48.074]  Ladies and gentlemen, their tourism's down over 50% in one year, over 80% in the last five.
[00:39:48.074 --> 00:39:48.935]  It's gone.
[00:39:48.935 --> 00:39:55.061]  Because you go to Paris, there is feces all over the ground in the nicest areas, and just wandering people
[00:39:55.621 --> 00:40:09.506]  Everywhere and the roads all over France are in a disaster zone with people running up out of the woods with hatchets if you stop at a sign in the woods and just raping you and your family and robbing you of your vehicle.
[00:40:09.506 --> 00:40:12.046]  And it's all covered up.
[00:40:12.046 --> 00:40:13.787]  Except by people on YouTube that catch it on tape.
[00:40:16.209 --> 00:40:26.053]  And this is what's been done, and it's, again, the globalists have expanded the third world, destroyed it, dumbed it down, and they have a gangster hip-hop culture that is overlaid.
[00:40:26.053 --> 00:40:44.922]  I don't care if it's Appalachian whites or North African blacks, you listen to this stuff, you get into it, it's thug culture, and then it just explodes, and it's designed to bring everything down to create global turmoil, so then a global military can come in and mop it up after the collapse that they're only beta testing right now.
[00:40:45.262 --> 00:40:53.134]  And I've been telling you this for close to 20 years because I had sources inside the Pentagon that were reporting it to me and even locals as well.
[00:40:53.857 --> 00:40:57.340]  That we're beta testing this, and they'd always say, oh, Jones says it's coming now.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.481]  No, I said it's coming later.
[00:40:58.481 --> 00:40:59.182]  And I made films on it.
[00:40:59.182 --> 00:41:05.247]  And now the military comes out in press releases, videos, and announcements and says, we're going to have to occupy every city on Earth.
[00:41:05.247 --> 00:41:08.410]  The United States is going to fall and society's broken, we've been told.
[00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:09.831]  And people go, oh, see, the military's evil.
[00:41:09.831 --> 00:41:13.655]  No, they're being given the job of cleaning up with the globalists for engineering.
[00:41:13.655 --> 00:41:14.896]  You'll be begging.
[00:41:16.581 --> 00:41:19.762]  When your city's burning, for the military to come in.
[00:41:19.762 --> 00:41:23.003]  So again, the news will say I'm saying the military's coming to kill us.
[00:41:23.003 --> 00:41:25.944]  No, that's not what I said.
[00:41:25.944 --> 00:41:27.405]  Coming soon to a senior U, the U.S.
[00:41:27.405 --> 00:41:31.426]  military plan to take over America permanently!
[00:41:31.426 --> 00:41:37.048]  And Trump knows about this, and Mattis knows about this, and they all don't want to do that.
[00:41:37.048 --> 00:41:37.408]  They like
[00:41:39.031 --> 00:41:46.078]  Happy folks and farmers and industry and wife and mom and apple pie and that's the plan.
[00:41:46.078 --> 00:41:47.319]  They're trying to kill the plan.
[00:41:47.319 --> 00:41:51.163]  It's not that they're even perfect, but I mean they're not pure evil.
[00:41:51.163 --> 00:41:59.170]  They don't want just some horrible over-the-top system where the globalists are so arrogant they've admitted their whole plan to everybody.
[00:41:59.170 --> 00:41:59.871]  That's what's crazy.
[00:42:02.992 --> 00:42:04.894]  You'll never force feed anybody this.
[00:42:04.894 --> 00:42:07.416]  I don't care if you shut the web off or shut us off.
[00:42:07.416 --> 00:42:15.223]  That'll make what we've said even more valuable in people's minds and hearts.
[00:42:15.223 --> 00:42:26.233]  They're making the same mistake tyrants always make because there's something about the type of brain that can get sucked into a tyrant's type mindset.
[00:42:30.717 --> 00:42:39.880]  It's just they just feed on the power trip and feed on it and just feel invincible and are just high on just this spirit of domination.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:51.925]  And you notice it's always weird demonic hunchback creatures like Hillary or Bill or, you know, this Evan McMullen guy and all these people because a normal person is so confident and so nice and so good.
[00:42:53.055 --> 00:42:57.799]  I mean, the meanest guys I've ever known in my life are the sweetest, nicest people you could ever imagine.
[00:42:57.799 --> 00:43:05.786]  They'll do anything for you and they care about you so much until you do something to them and then they will rip your head directly off your shoulders.
[00:43:05.786 --> 00:43:14.993]  And the problem is, in this modern world, the men are busy and distracted just taking care of their families while their families are being taken away from them by the globalists and the culture and all of it.
[00:43:14.993 --> 00:43:17.836]  And we just have to understand that we're not declaring war on them.
[00:43:17.836 --> 00:43:18.957]  They declared war on us!
[00:43:23.459 --> 00:43:29.426]  And they're going to find out that we know what they've done.
[00:43:29.426 --> 00:43:37.717]  And we're not going to sit here while they go on CNN and have CIA operatives that have run whole operations.
[00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:43.374]  To try to run a domestic operation against the President of the United States.
[00:43:43.374 --> 00:43:46.258]  That is completely and totally illegal.
[00:43:46.258 --> 00:43:48.741]  But I told people months ago, they're planning on killing Trump.
[00:43:48.741 --> 00:43:50.703]  They're planning on saying he's a Russian agent.
[00:43:50.703 --> 00:43:52.145]  And coming out and saying he's a Russian agent.
[00:43:52.145 --> 00:43:54.888]  And when they do, they're getting ready to assassinate him.
[00:43:54.888 --> 00:43:55.989]  And President Trump, you know.
[00:43:55.989 --> 00:43:58.432]  Guys, if you guys pull up, they're planning to kill Trump.
[00:43:59.494 --> 00:44:11.840]  Alex Jones, or the reports that, I mean we've written articles and countless videos in the last two months, but it goes back two months ago where I did all these reports and I said, they are preparing, I mean just type in, CIA is preparing to kill President Trump.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.861]  It was even picked up by newspapers.
[00:44:13.861 --> 00:44:15.582]  Just click news.
[00:44:15.582 --> 00:44:26.708]  And you can see where I said, it's a threat continuum, where they keep building it up, saying oh there's some Russians involved, oh there's some Russians inside, oh there's some Russians in the White House, oh Trump knew about it, Trump's a Russian agent.
[00:44:27.881 --> 00:44:30.562]  It was in the Evening Standard in England.
[00:44:30.562 --> 00:44:33.382]  It was in the Associated Press here in the United States.
[00:44:33.382 --> 00:44:36.363]  Russian insiders fear Washington establishment will assassinate Trump.
[00:44:36.363 --> 00:44:38.803]  Yeah, that's from this week.
[00:44:38.803 --> 00:44:42.204]  This is from, you can click news and get it.
[00:44:42.204 --> 00:44:46.525]  You just type in, warning elite will try to kill Trump.
[00:44:46.525 --> 00:44:47.725]  Yeah, that's not it.
[00:44:47.725 --> 00:44:49.286]  I'll find it during the break, it's alright.
[00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:52.046]  It was my maximum emergency for two months.
[00:44:52.046 --> 00:44:53.366]  Maximum of the crew.
[00:44:53.366 --> 00:44:54.767]  Maximum of the reporters.
[00:44:54.767 --> 00:44:55.267]  Maximum.
[00:44:57.714 --> 00:45:21.368]  Absolutely every day hammering articles, videos, everywhere where I explain, and even newspapers picked it up, where I said, the elite are planning to kill Trump by pushing this Russian narrative, by selling it to different groups inside the intelligence agencies, that it's okay to kill the president because he's really a Russian agent, and that they'll try to run this operation saying he's a domestic enemy.
[00:45:21.368 --> 00:45:25.130]  And I used those terms, and I said they'd use COG to try to bring down the president.
[00:45:26.817 --> 00:45:28.919]  We'll get him during the break.
[00:45:28.919 --> 00:45:32.342]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to this Le Pen.
[00:45:32.342 --> 00:45:40.690]  Le Pen is on course to be France's next president, fund manager says, from AI analysis.
[00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:43.633]  And the same big AI analysis groups said Trump was going to win.
[00:45:43.633 --> 00:45:47.517]  See, the real analytics with computers and mass movements, you know it's going to happen.
[00:45:47.517 --> 00:45:50.260]  That's why I was telling you Trump was 10, 15, 20 points ahead, depending on the state.
[00:45:51.772 --> 00:45:56.993]  That's why they were so panicked and freaking out saying, he's gonna lose, he's gonna lose, he's evil, he's KKK, kill him, kill him, kill him.
[00:45:56.993 --> 00:46:00.734]  Well, if he's gonna lose, why are you saying kill him, kill him, kill him?
[00:46:00.734 --> 00:46:01.294]  Because they knew.
[00:46:01.294 --> 00:46:03.354]  I'm gonna try to search this.
[00:46:03.354 --> 00:46:04.814]  It's not a big deal, but I have this.
[00:46:04.814 --> 00:46:10.915]  I'm not really OCD, but just about stuff like this, I am.
[00:46:10.915 --> 00:46:11.435]  There it is.
[00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:16.516]  I mean, because this is just absolutely essential that we get to this.
[00:46:16.516 --> 00:46:18.737]  I mean, it's, you know, you gotta click news is the issue.
[00:46:18.737 --> 00:46:18.957]  See, guys?
[00:46:18.957 --> 00:46:20.417]  That's what I'm telling you.
[00:46:22.685 --> 00:46:28.909]  Okay, now you type into that CIA planning to kill Trump, InfoWars.com.
[00:46:28.909 --> 00:46:30.310]  CIA planning to kill Trump.
[00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:33.593]  Yeah, that's the search.
[00:46:33.593 --> 00:46:35.974]  That's how you're going to find it.
[00:46:35.974 --> 00:46:37.976]  Scroll down.
[00:46:37.976 --> 00:46:39.977]  There it is.
[00:46:39.977 --> 00:46:44.941]  Oh, there's a spectator saying, well, they killed him on the CIA ousting.
[00:46:44.941 --> 00:46:45.701]  There you go.
[00:46:45.701 --> 00:46:49.244]  CIA and Obama planning to murder Donald Trump.
[00:46:49.244 --> 00:46:49.644]  That's it.
[00:46:52.244 --> 00:46:53.926]  But there's a bunch of them and I did reports.
[00:46:53.926 --> 00:46:57.029]  It's so important, I ought to just shut the show down until I have it.
[00:46:57.029 --> 00:47:01.714]  Because I did emergency reports up here, I did everything.
[00:47:01.714 --> 00:47:08.881]  And I laid out the whole continuum, because the public needs to see this, where I laid out the entire continuum starting two months ago.
[00:47:09.161 --> 00:47:24.789]  How they would build it up and get you ready, because at first it would be asinine to say he's a Russian agent with no proof, and they would just create this whole cloud, and then call for impeachment, then call for his overthrow, then call for his murder, and then when you heard the CIA people come out and start saying it, then you knew that they were seriously thinking about killing him.
[00:47:24.789 --> 00:47:27.490]  It's the Evening Standard has the video.
[00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:28.771]  The London Evening Standard.
[00:47:35.438 --> 00:47:36.739]  Will the CIA assassinate Trump?
[00:47:36.739 --> 00:47:38.960]  Ron Paul warns a more powerful shadow government.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:41.922]  Yeah, that was about a week after I did it, or two weeks after I did it.
[00:47:41.922 --> 00:47:45.564]  Alex Jones emergency message to President Trump.
[00:47:45.564 --> 00:47:46.725]  Let's see that video.
[00:47:46.725 --> 00:47:48.086]  Everything is now turned over to this.
[00:47:48.086 --> 00:47:53.909]  In fact, with all the reporters, everybody else, because I've been wanting for four or five days just to talk about how they're censoring his Twitter feed.
[00:47:53.909 --> 00:47:55.330]  And these are the key things!
[00:47:55.330 --> 00:48:02.054]  This is how we'll defeat them, by focusing on the keys!
[00:48:02.054 --> 00:48:03.355]  Let's go into a little pin clip, here it is.
[00:48:04.525 --> 00:48:10.432]  Investors in the financial markets are nervous about you because you want to return France.
[00:48:10.432 --> 00:48:12.174]  Yeah, sovereignty is bad.
[00:48:12.174 --> 00:48:12.314]  Why?
[00:48:18.131 --> 00:48:20.032]  For a very simple reason.
[00:48:20.032 --> 00:48:24.994]  In reality, we are in control of our own country, so long as we have our own currency.
[00:48:24.994 --> 00:48:27.395]  Money is one of the elements of sovereignty.
[00:48:27.395 --> 00:48:35.239]  If you don't have your own currency, you allow others to impose on your economic policies, your immigration policies, your social policies.
[00:48:35.239 --> 00:48:41.301]  The political austerity that is imposed today by the European Union is founded on the euro.
[00:48:41.301 --> 00:48:42.362]  We are a free people.
[00:48:42.782 --> 00:48:43.962]  We fought for this.
[00:48:43.962 --> 00:48:46.043]  You too fought to be a free people.
[00:48:46.043 --> 00:48:54.725]  It was not so that today we could give it all away to technocrats that we have not elected, who decided for us which policies we should adopt.
[00:48:54.725 --> 00:49:06.007]  And I don't want to accept the euro, which is no longer a currency in the spirit of the European Union, but is in reality a weapon, that it sticks in our sides to force us to go where they please.
[00:49:06.647 --> 00:49:08.708]  The euro is a failure.
[00:49:08.708 --> 00:49:10.028]  It's an economic failure.
[00:49:10.028 --> 00:49:11.529]  It's a social failure.
[00:49:11.529 --> 00:49:15.830]  It's one of the reasons for which France has seen such a high rate of unemployment.
[00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:18.411]  For which France has become so much poorer.
[00:49:18.411 --> 00:49:20.711]  For which our industry has failed.
[00:49:20.711 --> 00:49:24.713]  For which we are confronted with an unfair international rivalry.
[00:49:24.713 --> 00:49:29.114]  There is no reason for us not to return to our own national currency.
[00:49:30.632 --> 00:49:32.672]  All right, then let's go to the other clip.
[00:49:32.672 --> 00:49:38.053]  So this is, again, LePen, who is surging and set to win the election unless they kill her or cover it up.
[00:49:38.053 --> 00:49:45.995]  And our State Department says, we're going to help block her from winning because she's pro-Trump, showing you how the State Department is still just completely out of control in open rebellion.
[00:49:45.995 --> 00:49:54.896]  But none of those crimes matter because, you know, a few traitors in the government say Trump's National Security Advisor said, yeah, we'll set you up with the President to talk about sanctions.
[00:49:54.896 --> 00:49:55.916]  That's what you do.
[00:49:55.916 --> 00:49:56.957]  They admit that's what you do.
[00:49:56.957 --> 00:49:59.117]  But, oh, this is he's a he's a big threat now.
[00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:03.572]  So Le Pen, the euro is a weapon used against EU nations.
[00:50:03.572 --> 00:50:07.455]  Le Pen, we will leave the EU to restore sovereignty.
[00:50:07.455 --> 00:50:09.377]  We're going to come back to that after the break.
[00:50:09.377 --> 00:50:11.898]  And look, if I get upset on air, folks, and frustrated, it's not with the crew.
[00:50:11.898 --> 00:50:14.700]  I mean, this is just incredibly epic times.
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:15.681]  It's so over the top.
[00:50:15.681 --> 00:50:21.705]  And everybody knows it's effective to show people your predictions word for word, but we can never find them.
[00:50:21.705 --> 00:50:22.166]  Ever.
[00:50:22.166 --> 00:50:22.906]  Maybe one out of 5,000.
[00:50:22.906 --> 00:50:25.908]  I mean, every listener heard it freaking 500 times.
[00:50:27.372 --> 00:50:28.072]  Warning!
[00:50:28.072 --> 00:50:29.613]  Now, that might be it.
[00:50:29.613 --> 00:50:31.194]  Elite will try to kill Trump.
[00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:33.576]  Trump is a danger if he continues to take on the entire establishment.
[00:50:33.576 --> 00:50:35.377]  What date is that?
[00:50:35.377 --> 00:50:36.938]  That's November 11th, right after the deal.
[00:50:36.938 --> 00:50:38.759]  Yeah, but it came about a week after that.
[00:50:38.759 --> 00:50:40.400]  See, the newspapers picked it up.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:47.264]  That's what's getting me angry here, is that we've got Alex Jones, CIA planning to kill Trump.
[00:50:47.264 --> 00:50:48.605]  British newspapers picked it up.
[00:50:48.605 --> 00:50:49.125]  So did U.S.
[00:50:49.125 --> 00:50:50.306]  newspapers.
[00:50:50.306 --> 00:50:53.908]  I understand there's thousands of them reporting on the stuff, but, you know, we're gonna find it.
[00:50:53.908 --> 00:50:54.428]  We'll be back.
[00:50:54.428 --> 00:50:55.169]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:00.376 --> 00:51:06.001]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's, in an epic battle of David versus Goliath.
[00:51:06.001 --> 00:51:08.383]  In the early 1980s, a child was born.
[00:51:08.383 --> 00:51:09.324]  Two of them, actually.
[00:51:09.324 --> 00:51:11.385]  Their names were Jeff and Andy.
[00:51:11.385 --> 00:51:15.769]  Time went by, they developed facial hair, and one day, something happened.
[00:51:15.769 --> 00:51:17.911]  Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors.
[00:51:18.371 --> 00:51:22.356]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all.
[00:51:22.356 --> 00:51:31.307]  They hired the best designers, they bought a 95-year-old German blade factory, and they started selling high-quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers.
[00:51:31.307 --> 00:51:33.670]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:35.192]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:36.513]  Don't worry.
[00:51:36.513 --> 00:51:42.058]  Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to give all guys a great shave at a great price.
[00:51:42.058 --> 00:51:43.460]  Try Harry's free.
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:49.145]  They'll send you a razor with five German blades, foaming shave gel, and even a travel blade cover when you sign up.
[00:51:49.145 --> 00:51:50.086]  Just cover shipping.

[00:52:00.644 --> 00:52:02.345]  Hi there, Dick Allgaier here.
[00:52:02.345 --> 00:52:06.707]  I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades.
[00:52:06.707 --> 00:52:10.188]  I normally never do commercial endorsements.
[00:52:10.188 --> 00:52:12.869]  I am very skeptical of health supplements.
[00:52:12.869 --> 00:52:17.011]  But a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One.
[00:52:17.011 --> 00:52:21.373]  So I purchased a bottle and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now.
[00:52:21.713 --> 00:52:24.734]  I very much dislike so-called energy boosters.
[00:52:24.734 --> 00:52:30.496]  Those little energy drinks that have caffeine and guarana and other things that make your heart race.
[00:52:30.496 --> 00:52:31.617]  This is not that.
[00:52:31.617 --> 00:52:34.878]  My experience with Synergy One has been great.
[00:52:34.878 --> 00:52:36.118]  My mood is better.
[00:52:36.118 --> 00:52:37.319]  My joints feel better.
[00:52:37.319 --> 00:52:42.061]  I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity.
[00:52:42.061 --> 00:52:45.682]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more.
[00:52:45.682 --> 00:52:47.663]  So I recommend Synergy One.
[00:52:47.663 --> 00:52:48.743]  It's really good stuff.
[00:52:48.743 --> 00:52:50.544]  I'm having great results with it.

[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:48.122]  Tired of the tyranny and crime in the sanctuary cities?
[00:53:48.122 --> 00:53:50.885]  Flee the city and seek refuge in the American Redoubt.
[00:53:50.885 --> 00:53:52.446]  FleeTheCity.com.

[00:53:56.909 --> 00:53:57.710]  FleeTheCity.com.
[00:54:00.489 --> 00:54:03.392]  We're good.
[00:54:15.595 --> 00:54:18.297]  Look, I got so upset earlier, I didn't get to all the Le Pen quotes.
[00:54:18.297 --> 00:54:18.877]  Here it is.
[00:54:18.877 --> 00:54:21.819]  Reality of Le Pen is a shock to the establishment.
[00:54:21.819 --> 00:54:22.480]  We just played that.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.382]  Number two, Le Pen, the euro is a weapon used against EU nation states.
[00:54:26.382 --> 00:54:30.625]  Number three, Le Pen, France will leave the EU to restore sovereignty.
[00:54:30.625 --> 00:54:31.946]  I want to play more of that.
[00:54:31.946 --> 00:54:32.966]  This is really good news.
[00:54:32.966 --> 00:54:33.907]  This is really positive.
[00:54:33.907 --> 00:54:36.088]  And I get frustrated because
[00:54:37.031 --> 00:54:38.152]  It's not the crew.
[00:54:38.152 --> 00:54:45.516]  There are so many hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles that have come out now just since I first predicted it saying the CIA needs to kill Trump.
[00:54:45.516 --> 00:54:46.757]  He's a Russian agent.
[00:54:46.757 --> 00:54:51.580]  I told everybody they're building up to that to say he's a Russian agent time to kill him.
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:55.883]  What I was getting upset about of your radio listener is while they were putting
[00:54:57.193 --> 00:55:05.317]  All of that up on the screen, as they were search-engineering, as I was reading it, it was mainstream news saying the CIA needs to kill Trump.
[00:55:05.317 --> 00:55:08.659]  So, they've now gone further than I even thought.
[00:55:08.659 --> 00:55:23.687]  They've gone from, oh, there might be a few Russians that got involved, might have been hacked, to, oh, the American people didn't really vote for Trump, the Russians stole it with no evidence, to, oh, there's a few Russians maybe talking to people inside the administration, to, Trump's not allowed to talk to Russians, to, he is a Russian, to, he is a, quote,
[00:55:24.844 --> 00:55:29.087]  Domestic enemy that needs to be killed.
[00:55:29.087 --> 00:55:38.253]  And then they search engine, I didn't even know that there were articles everywhere today saying, kill Trump, CIA, kill Trump.
[00:55:38.253 --> 00:55:45.438]  I mean, the so-called left is just a bunch of mentally ill losers that hate everybody in prosperity and hate somebody trying to cut their taxes.
[00:55:45.438 --> 00:55:53.044]  They're just a bunch of miserable morons that have been conned and they're such losers, they're like brainwashed by their very Stockholm controllers.
[00:55:55.435 --> 00:55:57.676]  There's one of the articles.
[00:55:57.676 --> 00:55:59.437]  What was the date of that?
[00:55:59.437 --> 00:56:00.778]  That was December 21st.
[00:56:00.778 --> 00:56:04.040]  Shock claim, the CIA is trying to assassinate Donald Trump.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:06.061]  They were certainly pushing the idea beforehand.
[00:56:06.061 --> 00:56:09.583]  There's a bunch of others where I said they're going to build it up and then say time to kill him.
[00:56:09.583 --> 00:56:10.664]  And now they're doing it.
[00:56:10.664 --> 00:56:13.225]  Alex Jones, the CIA is trying to assassinate Donald Trump.
[00:56:13.225 --> 00:56:22.791]  I said they're preparing everyone, December 20th, that's Salon, to want to do it, to sell the idea, to normalize it before they do it.
[00:56:22.791 --> 00:56:23.992]  They're preparing the ground.
[00:56:25.643 --> 00:56:27.664]  And what comes next?
[00:56:27.664 --> 00:56:29.786]  The killing of the 45th president?
[00:56:29.786 --> 00:56:31.467]  Or setting a nuke off in D.C.?
[00:56:31.467 --> 00:56:34.088]  Or blowing up federal buildings and claiming patriots did it?
[00:56:34.088 --> 00:56:37.430]  I mean, they're moving, and everybody just needs to know.
[00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:49.378]  Look at who the globalists are, look at who's running things, look at who's doing this to our country, and remember, someday, maybe soon, maybe long time, might be in between, they will be brought to justice, and they need to know that!
[00:56:50.333 --> 00:56:56.575]  Because they're a bunch of megalomaniac, narcissistic, borderline personality disorder loons.
[00:56:56.575 --> 00:57:03.338]  And me, I'm here letting you know how I feel, rallying humanity to get out of their complacency.
[00:57:03.338 --> 00:57:15.023]  And I will tell you, the demographics, the numbers, President Trump's operation has directly credited me over the telephone with being one of the key liberty demographics that put Trump over the edge.
[00:57:16.141 --> 00:57:17.241]  The shock troops, you name it.
[00:57:17.241 --> 00:57:21.303]  And it was everybody together, but I'm just telling you, the enemy knows that.
[00:57:21.303 --> 00:57:24.704]  Trump's got a press conference we're getting in a few minutes we're going to go to.
[00:57:24.704 --> 00:57:25.425]  Just see what he's saying.
[00:57:25.425 --> 00:57:29.366]  Just briefly, I need to fund this operation and I need your prayers.
[00:57:29.366 --> 00:57:31.107]  We've come out with what is the ultimate
[00:57:32.185 --> 00:57:36.728]  Caveman True Paleo Formula made with cartilage, bone broth, and paleo ingredients.
[00:57:36.728 --> 00:57:39.190]  The next generation of advanced paleo nutrition.
[00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.950]  Everybody's into it.
[00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:40.831]  Whey and stuff.
[00:57:40.831 --> 00:57:41.631]  Yeah, that's great, folks.
[00:57:41.631 --> 00:57:42.932]  And you can obviously mix this with milk.
[00:57:42.932 --> 00:57:46.414]  It's got a little bit of sweetener from Stevie in it, and chocolate, you know, in it.
[00:57:46.414 --> 00:57:46.915]  It's cocoa.
[00:57:46.915 --> 00:57:50.677]  But we're going to come up with one that is unflavored as well.
[00:57:50.677 --> 00:57:52.118]  But the point is, it's amazing.
[00:57:52.118 --> 00:57:54.580]  It's the highest quality it is.
[00:57:56.249 --> 00:57:58.551]  Concentrated, and it supports the broadcast.
[00:57:58.551 --> 00:58:02.533]  There are competitors out there that don't have half the substance this does that costs more.
[00:58:02.533 --> 00:58:03.714]  And it's discounted out of the gates.
[00:58:03.714 --> 00:58:05.916]  A lot of folks are getting it, so thank you for your support.
[00:58:05.916 --> 00:58:07.157]  Caveman, True Paleo.
[00:58:07.157 --> 00:58:12.541]  We also have the fluoride-free toothpaste with iodine, ankyloyl, silver, and more.
[00:58:12.541 --> 00:58:14.402]  Super Blue.

[00:58:34.947 --> 00:58:37.148]  We gotta... Oh, I meant to start the show with this.
[00:58:37.148 --> 00:58:38.889]  This is so... Stay with us.
[00:58:38.889 --> 00:58:39.689]  This is key.
[00:58:39.689 --> 00:58:40.969]  Tell everybody to tune in, folks.
[00:58:40.969 --> 00:58:43.811]  This is total war against humanity.
[00:58:43.811 --> 00:58:44.431]  We're gonna defeat them.
[00:58:50.194 --> 00:58:57.458]  Since the federal judge has halted Trump's executive order, 60% of the refugee arrivals to the United States have come from terror-prone countries.
[00:58:57.458 --> 00:58:59.219]  In fact, the most terror-prone.
[00:58:59.219 --> 00:58:59.759]  Since U.S.
[00:58:59.759 --> 00:59:10.626]  District Judge James Robart's restraining order, the United States has taken 532 refugees from Syria, a civil war-torn country ripe with terrorists, in which President Assad of Syria and U.S.
[00:59:10.626 --> 00:59:14.888]  intelligence agencies said are infiltrating refugee groups.
[00:59:14.888 --> 00:59:18.210]  472 refugees from Iraq, where Americans can't even go out on the streets,
[00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:24.898]  363 from Somalia, where we already had a refugee stab 11 people at Ohio State.
[00:59:24.898 --> 00:59:32.667]  117 refugees from Iran, where they just last week held a march, where they marched on the American flag and chanted death to the US in the streets.
[00:59:32.667 --> 00:59:36.372]  And 65 are from Sudan, a failed state, for a total of 1,549 refugees.
[00:59:38.254 --> 00:59:39.395]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:13.889 --> 01:00:21.375]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:24.858]  People ask me, and that's why I say it every hour, they say, are you fake?
[01:00:24.858 --> 01:00:26.800]  No, everything I say, I believe.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.202]  Unless I'm doing a comedy piece and it's satire.
[01:00:29.202 --> 01:00:30.122]  And I tell you it's satire.
[01:00:30.122 --> 01:00:34.926]  I don't even do a lot of satire now because it's just things are so serious.
[01:00:34.926 --> 01:00:40.190]  But I get pent up, I get really upset, and then I just let it out on air, and then sometimes,
[01:00:41.394 --> 01:00:48.140]  When I really get upset and realize that I'm absolutely on target and that they're going to cause a civil war, kill Trump, you name it, if we don't stop them.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.281]  I mean, I want to do something.
[01:00:49.281 --> 01:00:53.385]  It's like knowing your neighbor's house is on fire, a kid's out in the street about to be run over by a truck.
[01:00:53.385 --> 01:00:54.206]  I mean, you get upset.
[01:00:54.206 --> 01:00:56.528]  I care.
[01:00:56.528 --> 01:01:00.271]  And I'm not saying I'm perfect, but man, I've been in restaurants.
[01:01:00.271 --> 01:01:06.377]  Like I told a story, my son was only about a year old and I'm in a restaurant and I go to the bathroom, come back out, the family.
[01:01:07.554 --> 01:01:16.139]  And they're going 9-1-1, call 9-1-1, call 9-1-1, like a bunch of birds around this woman, turning blue and leaning over the table.
[01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:18.841]  And I go, Heimlich Maneuver.
[01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.422]  They're like, 9-1-1, sir, we're waiting for 9-1-1.
[01:01:20.422 --> 01:01:23.603]  Ambulances are being called.
[01:01:23.603 --> 01:01:26.245]  And I'm just like, she'll be dead in four minutes.
[01:01:26.245 --> 01:01:28.927]  So I had to actually push these beta males and people aside.
[01:01:28.927 --> 01:01:30.668]  It was a LaMadeleine restaurant.
[01:01:30.668 --> 01:01:32.749]  And I had to get in there, and this woman probably weighed
[01:01:35.182 --> 01:01:37.464]  Two hundred and fifty pounds.
[01:01:37.464 --> 01:01:41.147]  And she was an older Down Syndrome person.
[01:01:41.147 --> 01:01:43.529]  One of the older ones I've seen, probably forty.
[01:01:43.529 --> 01:01:47.192]  And I got her and picked her up and got the food out.
[01:01:47.192 --> 01:01:48.413]  It was a big old piece of bread.
[01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:50.235]  It was like a huge chunk.
[01:01:50.235 --> 01:01:52.657]  Turns pink, turns white.
[01:01:52.657 --> 01:01:56.040]  And I knew that they'd sue me or something because I kind of felt a rib doodle or something.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.461]  I mean, she was hard to get up.
[01:02:01.854 --> 01:02:07.656]  They were all going, oh thank you, you're a hero, oh my god, it's a wonderful, oh, is she okay?
[01:02:07.656 --> 01:02:10.896]  I know these are rats, get away, I'll be sued, I can't even help anybody.
[01:02:10.896 --> 01:02:13.437]  It's like when cops help people and they get sued.
[01:02:13.437 --> 01:02:16.098]  So it's just, it's like, I'm not one of those people, okay?
[01:02:16.098 --> 01:02:22.820]  I don't plan to be Mr. America or Captain USA or any of this stuff and have all the answers, but I'm telling you, I'm not out to get people.
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.760]  Let me show TV viewers who's not out to get you as well.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.081]  This is on Infowars.com by Dan Lyman.
[01:02:29.386 --> 01:02:33.687]  Trump Farage planned massive charity rally in UK, breaking parliamentary blockade.
[01:02:33.687 --> 01:02:35.568]  Yeah, Trump's not allowed to come speak to the parliament.
[01:02:35.568 --> 01:02:37.468]  American presidents aren't welcome.
[01:02:37.468 --> 01:02:39.448]  Because they don't want to have open borders and be globalist.
[01:02:39.448 --> 01:02:41.029]  I mean, how ridiculous is that?
[01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:43.489]  When you sit back and look at all this.
[01:02:43.489 --> 01:02:49.351]  President to bypass politicians, raise money for British vets instead.
[01:02:49.351 --> 01:02:52.192]  And look at those two guys, man.
[01:02:52.192 --> 01:02:56.052]  That photo, I remember I was working late at night, planning stuff right after Trump won.
[01:02:59.363 --> 01:03:00.164]  Haha!
[01:03:00.164 --> 01:03:14.296]  Compare that to photos of Hayden, and Crapper, Brennan, and other miscreant creatures, and little know-it-all twits like Crystal.
[01:03:14.296 --> 01:03:15.177]  Just compare that.
[01:03:15.177 --> 01:03:16.138]  Look at the arrogance.
[01:03:16.138 --> 01:03:22.023]  Can you imagine?
[01:03:22.023 --> 01:03:22.223]  Okay.
[01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:24.571]  I told you the big news is coming up.
[01:03:24.571 --> 01:03:25.432]  I need to settle down.
[01:03:25.432 --> 01:03:29.096]  I'm not going to apologize for earlier, because it's what we need to be doing, getting upset.
[01:03:29.096 --> 01:03:31.418]  Some really good things are happening.
[01:03:31.418 --> 01:03:34.882]  Overall, things are very, very positive, but they're still so dangerous.
[01:03:34.882 --> 01:03:46.134]  It's like you look at your son or your daughter that's doing good in school, working out hard, loves God, strong, and it makes you love them that much more and worry about it that much more.
[01:03:48.123 --> 01:04:09.927]  So I'm worried about the Prodigal Sons here, because let me tell you, the amount of movement and the bunkers being built, and Obama moving in saying he's at war with Trump, and all the build-up to try to take the President out, and CIA people saying he's an enemy agent, he's a quote, domestic enemy and needs to be taken out on CNN, I mean they've now hit that level
[01:04:11.249 --> 01:04:15.696]  So if you're not in the streets, if you're not rallying, if you're not... Don't wait for others.
[01:04:15.696 --> 01:04:16.778]  Just go do it.
[01:04:16.778 --> 01:04:19.703]  At your capitals, at your city halls, at your... Call into C-SPAN.
[01:04:19.703 --> 01:04:21.445]  In fact, I'm gonna talk when we come back.
[01:04:23.598 --> 01:04:26.039]  About what I know Trump should do.
[01:04:26.039 --> 01:04:27.760]  And, Mr. President, you're really smart.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:33.042]  They got you on a dizzying schedule trying to get your cabinet in so you can, like, actually govern.
[01:04:33.042 --> 01:04:34.983]  But they're going to sabotage you before that ever happens.
[01:04:34.983 --> 01:04:36.904]  This is the big push right now.
[01:04:36.904 --> 01:04:41.166]  If Trump beats this one, they're going to diminish and it's not going to be as bad.
[01:04:41.166 --> 01:04:42.067]  But this is it.
[01:04:42.067 --> 01:04:45.788]  I mean, my gut tells me... I mean, I can hardly sleep at this point.
[01:04:45.788 --> 01:04:48.149]  I am just completely... I mean, you know.
[01:04:48.149 --> 01:04:49.690]  I'm trying to control myself.
[01:04:49.690 --> 01:04:50.691]  Okay?
[01:04:50.691 --> 01:04:50.971]  Because...
[01:04:52.853 --> 01:04:54.214]  I mean, this is it.
[01:04:54.214 --> 01:04:57.275]  This is it, and this is for all the marbles.
[01:04:57.275 --> 01:05:00.116]  The globals are getting their asses kicked right now.
[01:05:00.116 --> 01:05:05.178]  In a protest against Donald Trump's tight citizenship policy, a day without immigrants has been declared nationwide.
[01:05:05.178 --> 01:05:10.560]  Today, February 16th, 2017, will go down in history as a day without immigrants.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.280]  Look around you.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.581]  Is that person an immigrant?
[01:05:12.581 --> 01:05:14.302]  Imagine if they were just gone.
[01:05:14.302 --> 01:05:15.142]  But wait a second.
[01:05:15.142 --> 01:05:17.283]  This ideal or illustration doesn't make sense.
[01:05:17.283 --> 01:05:19.084]  President Trump is not deporting immigrants.
[01:05:19.084 --> 01:05:22.605]  In fact, I'm yet to see or hear any policy that deals directly with just immigrants.
[01:05:22.805 --> 01:05:24.586]  So, are citizens of the U.S.
[01:05:24.586 --> 01:05:31.652]  that have immigrated here going to take off work in protest for those who want to skirt the legal process that they went through to be an immigrant?
[01:05:31.652 --> 01:05:32.793]  An interesting notion.
[01:05:32.793 --> 01:05:39.058]  Or will this just be a bunch of self-loathing white liberal college students and older women like usual in a desperate attempt to virtue signal against Trump?
[01:05:39.418 --> 01:05:43.642]  Or, will non-citizens show up and proudly announce that they work here illegally?
[01:05:43.642 --> 01:05:47.346]  The goal of this protest is to display how imperative immigrants are to society.
[01:05:47.346 --> 01:05:49.228]  Guess we will find that out real quick.
[01:05:49.228 --> 01:05:56.955]  Or, we will see that people who immigrated here came here to work for a better life and have better things to do than protest a process that they followed.
[01:05:56.955 --> 01:05:59.177]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:05:59.838 --> 01:06:00.658]  Hey, everyone.
[01:06:00.658 --> 01:06:02.959]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:06.800]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.881]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:19.144]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:06:19.144 --> 01:06:25.126]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:06:25.606 --> 01:06:42.465]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work,
[01:06:42.905 --> 01:06:46.348]  You need to check out Infowarsteam.com.
[01:06:46.348 --> 01:06:48.310]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:50.772]  Head over to Infowarsteam.com.
[01:06:50.772 --> 01:06:52.614]  Your body will be very grateful.
[01:06:52.614 --> 01:06:55.657]  On the web at Infowarsteam.com.
[01:06:55.657 --> 01:06:57.418]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:04.043]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:07:04.043 --> 01:07:14.991]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:07:15.151 --> 01:07:20.196]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:07:20.196 --> 01:07:22.758]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:07:22.758 --> 01:07:24.479]  It helps detoxify.
[01:07:24.479 --> 01:07:27.362]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:07:27.362 --> 01:07:32.146]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:07:32.146 --> 01:07:36.270]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:43.815]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:07:43.815 --> 01:07:45.436]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[01:07:45.436 --> 01:07:46.417]  This is so key.
[01:07:46.417 --> 01:07:50.739]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[01:07:50.739 --> 01:07:52.961]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[01:07:52.961 --> 01:07:56.423]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:08:05.888 --> 01:08:11.913]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[01:08:11.913 --> 01:08:15.856]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:15.856 --> 01:08:21.760]  I've been saying we're the resistance to the globalists for 20 years.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:27.785]  And now, what do you see the number one Democratic Party operative, Facebook, Twitter, Google, all of them saying?
[01:08:27.785 --> 01:08:28.865]  They are the resistance!
[01:08:28.865 --> 01:08:30.647]  Michael Moore is the resistance!
[01:08:31.644 --> 01:08:55.213]  No, the entire corporate media, all the big globalist foreign banks, all the big foreign, you know, evil countries like Communist China and Saudi Arabia, they're all weighing in, and all the rogue elements of the CIA are all weighing in, saying Trump's a, quote, domestic enemy on CNN, Evan McMullin last night, and needs to be taken out.
[01:08:55.213 --> 01:08:59.135]  The president is announcing his new secretary.
[01:09:01.758 --> 01:09:07.080]  And he's in the press conference now, but he had a statement on the media and their deception.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:08.460]  And I've been saying this.
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:12.382]  He lost the first debate because he was nice and didn't go on the offense.
[01:09:12.382 --> 01:09:13.362]  So what if she's a woman?
[01:09:13.362 --> 01:09:14.022]  She's a criminal.
[01:09:14.022 --> 01:09:15.323]  She sucked Haiti dry.
[01:09:15.323 --> 01:09:16.163]  She's a war criminal.
[01:09:16.163 --> 01:09:18.044]  Benghazi.
[01:09:18.044 --> 01:09:19.504]  He goes on and on.
[01:09:19.504 --> 01:09:22.546]  He tore up in the second one and he dominated.
[01:09:22.546 --> 01:09:23.486]  And he surged the polls.
[01:09:25.888 --> 01:09:36.991]  Trump has to come out, and Paul's going to do an article on this, and we've covered it a lot, how China and Saudi Arabia and others openly funded Hillary, and say, okay, you have your investigations.
[01:09:36.991 --> 01:09:39.751]  If my people talk to Russians, I'm the president.
[01:09:39.751 --> 01:09:41.672]  Of course we talk to the Russians over the phone.
[01:09:41.672 --> 01:09:43.632]  I'm going to meet with Putin.
[01:09:43.632 --> 01:09:44.332]  That's what he should say.
[01:09:44.332 --> 01:09:48.493]  You think the public's that dumb?
[01:09:48.493 --> 01:09:51.514]  And we're going to now have an investigation.
[01:09:52.699 --> 01:09:59.233]  of the Chinese and the Saudi Arabians and everybody else openly bragging that I wasn't going to win because they were giving money to Hillary.
[01:09:59.233 --> 01:10:02.499]  And just start indicting these people.
[01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:03.782]  Sessions needs to be turned loose.
[01:10:04.758 --> 01:10:05.719]  Not vindictively.
[01:10:05.719 --> 01:10:07.440]  Hillary needs to go to prison.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.722]  We sell Hillary for prison.
[01:10:09.722 --> 01:10:09.782]  2017.
[01:10:09.782 --> 01:10:11.904]  On the back it says, deport Soros.
[01:10:11.904 --> 01:10:16.187]  And there are petitions at WhiteHouse.gov right now to deport Soros.
[01:10:16.187 --> 01:10:18.789]  Trump needs to go on the offense.
[01:10:18.789 --> 01:10:31.058]  Or, I'm here to tell you, Mr. President, I began saying on November 10th, they're going to say you're a Russian agent, they're going to build it up in a continuum until they say you're a Russian agent, need to be overthrown, so they can get a group
[01:10:32.159 --> 01:10:44.151]  To believe they followed orders, in case they get stopped or defeated, to follow orders to try to kill you, claiming you're a Russian agent, and use that as a cover story if the public learns about it.
[01:10:44.151 --> 01:10:46.293]  And you, of course, understand this is going on.
[01:10:46.293 --> 01:10:48.795]  They're trying to get rid of the head of your private security right now.
[01:10:48.795 --> 01:10:50.837]  You know they've got the Secret Service infiltrated.
[01:10:50.837 --> 01:10:51.378]  That's admitted.
[01:10:52.455 --> 01:10:53.875]  Most of them are good people.
[01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:57.856]  But the federal government has been totally infiltrated by globalist operatives.
[01:10:57.856 --> 01:10:59.177]  And here's the deal.
[01:10:59.177 --> 01:11:00.657]  I want to fix things peacefully.
[01:11:00.657 --> 01:11:01.677]  We've gone a long way.
[01:11:01.677 --> 01:11:06.219]  I used to argue with CIA people and stuff that I'd talk to on air and off air.
[01:11:06.219 --> 01:11:07.459]  And again, I'm not with the CIA.
[01:11:07.459 --> 01:11:08.659]  I talked to everybody.
[01:11:08.659 --> 01:11:13.881]  And they'd say, oh, we need to have our own conservative or libertarian spring here in this country.
[01:11:13.881 --> 01:11:15.101]  We need to take these people on.
[01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:20.551]  And I said, we're kicking their butt in the Info War.
[01:11:20.551 --> 01:11:22.792]  That's why they stage false flags to blame us.
[01:11:22.792 --> 01:11:23.952]  We don't need to get violent.
[01:11:23.952 --> 01:11:25.813]  We need to get political and win.
[01:11:25.813 --> 01:11:27.614]  But we have elected a president.
[01:11:27.614 --> 01:11:37.177]  We have foreign multinational groups involved, openly giving money to build a bunker two miles away with Obama in it, with 30,000 activists, to try to overthrow the president.
[01:11:37.177 --> 01:11:38.278]  That's illegal!
[01:11:38.278 --> 01:11:39.158]  That's not free speech.
[01:11:39.158 --> 01:11:40.399]  That's called espionage.
[01:11:40.399 --> 01:11:41.639]  That's called sedition.
[01:11:41.639 --> 01:11:45.901]  That's called paramilitary stuff the CIA did in a bunch of countries to overthrow him.
[01:11:48.021 --> 01:11:57.514]  And they're openly running this operation, and I get they want to trick Trump into overreacting, but it's not overreacting when they're committing crimes.
[01:11:57.514 --> 01:12:02.641]  So at this point, the president has a responsibility to have a big press conference, lay out what they've done.
[01:12:04.966 --> 01:12:08.509]  If his own people, I know Bannon knows what's going on, can't lay it out, we're more than happy.
[01:12:08.509 --> 01:12:13.553]  I don't see what the President does or says what we say or do, but, you know, he gets our points.
[01:12:13.553 --> 01:12:19.478]  We've already got the reports out, we'll codify them, put it all out, we'll show you where they bragged that they ran the election and they gave money.
[01:12:19.478 --> 01:12:22.681]  The Saudis bragged they funded Hillary 20%, totally illegal.
[01:12:22.681 --> 01:12:23.662]  Arrest her ass right now!
[01:12:25.077 --> 01:12:26.899]  It's not hard to do.
[01:12:26.899 --> 01:12:28.841]  And by the way, I'm not stupid.
[01:12:28.841 --> 01:12:34.267]  Everybody else is scared to say this and do this in his entourage and in Congress, because they all know what happens.
[01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:36.028]  I'm not scared.
[01:12:36.028 --> 01:12:38.391]  God's going to take care of my kids and my family.
[01:12:38.391 --> 01:12:39.892]  That's all that matters.
[01:12:39.892 --> 01:12:41.674]  I am so... because there's no future.
[01:12:42.662 --> 01:12:43.362]  With them winning.
[01:12:43.362 --> 01:12:47.645]  I'm not going to just sit here and play patsy cake with these people and halfway fight them.
[01:12:47.645 --> 01:12:49.225]  I'm not playing games.
[01:12:49.225 --> 01:12:52.467]  If I'm one thing, you can say Alex Jones is genuine.
[01:12:52.467 --> 01:12:54.008]  Genuine article.
[01:12:54.008 --> 01:12:55.148]  And what does that mean?
[01:12:55.148 --> 01:13:10.436]  I'm not going to support a fifth column of pedophiles and scumbags that openly say they're going to be rich and we're all going to be poor and then a man comes in who's Americana and delivers on what he said he'd do.
[01:13:13.083 --> 01:13:16.385]  And they're just fighting to make sure you don't learn he did what he said he'd do.
[01:13:16.385 --> 01:13:21.347]  Quite frankly, since Andrew Jackson or George Washington, I've never seen anything like this.
[01:13:21.347 --> 01:13:26.470]  Right now, Trump is already in the top three presidents of all time.
[01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:34.455]  And notice his office is full of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, and the CIA and public affairs puts out reports going, okay, he's totally for real.
[01:13:34.455 --> 01:13:35.655]  He wants Americana.
[01:13:35.655 --> 01:13:39.357]  Oh my God, he's gonna take over our whole operation that we built worldwide using American money and power.
[01:13:44.278 --> 01:13:46.179]  What are you gonna do?
[01:13:46.179 --> 01:13:50.460]  LePen is saying everything I say, everything Trump says, because it's the truth.
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:54.201]  LePen isn't listening to me.
[01:13:54.201 --> 01:13:56.762]  LePen's listening to me from 20 years ago.
[01:13:56.762 --> 01:13:58.823]  And Barry Goldwater from 50 years ago.
[01:13:58.823 --> 01:14:00.763]  And Ron Paul from 30 years ago.
[01:14:00.763 --> 01:14:02.844]  And Matt Drudge from 21 years ago.
[01:14:02.844 --> 01:14:05.325]  Those ripples went out across the globe.
[01:14:05.325 --> 01:14:06.705]  And now they're devastating.
[01:14:06.705 --> 01:14:10.887]  And if you think ripples from 20, 30 years ago are hurting you right now,
[01:14:11.707 --> 01:14:16.631]  What do you think is going to happen when the tsunami megawaves hit and they're coming in quicker?
[01:14:16.631 --> 01:14:18.393]  It's not going to take 30 years now.
[01:14:18.393 --> 01:14:26.740]  They're coming in six months apart, months apart, weeks apart, days apart, hours apart, minutes apart.
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:31.104]  You think you'll stop human ascension and God's plan?
[01:14:31.104 --> 01:14:38.230]  All that matters is that my spirit be lined up with God's and God's plan and to be a good person and try to build and try to help people.
[01:14:40.046 --> 01:14:40.646]  That's what matters.
[01:14:40.646 --> 01:14:42.827]  It's the test to not be with them.
[01:14:42.827 --> 01:14:46.369]  The planet doesn't even matter in the final equation.
[01:14:46.369 --> 01:14:47.910]  Temporal power is nothing.
[01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:56.034]  What matters is our choice now, not being with the fallen scum.
[01:14:56.034 --> 01:14:59.796]  That is, Hayden and Evan McMullin and the rest of them and Brennan.
[01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:03.398]  They can't even get good-looking, strong men to serve them.
[01:15:04.178 --> 01:15:07.201]  Who have killed hundreds of people and done terrible things.
[01:15:07.201 --> 01:15:09.043]  Because they still have souls.
[01:15:09.043 --> 01:15:14.649]  They can't join with killing their ancestors' country and overrunning a great plan.
[01:15:14.649 --> 01:15:17.973]  So many people did evil things, they believe, for America.
[01:15:17.973 --> 01:15:23.619]  And the whole time, they were doing it for dirtbags that hate this country more than anything in the universe!
[01:15:26.496 --> 01:15:31.640]  How dare them say that national sovereignty and freedom came from the Russians?
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.722]  It comes from humans that want freedom.
[01:15:33.722 --> 01:15:37.464]  And the stronger the humans, the more they're going to want that.
[01:15:37.464 --> 01:15:47.372]  And they hate the kinship of nations against the global technotronic threat.
[01:15:47.372 --> 01:15:49.754]  Trump must move.
[01:15:51.621 --> 01:15:56.342]  Not against the mindless people attacking women and burning things and shooting cops in the back.
[01:15:56.342 --> 01:15:59.683]  That's bad, but you know, that's their free speech to kill the cops.
[01:15:59.683 --> 01:16:01.444]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:16:01.444 --> 01:16:04.925]  All you do is you move against Soros and his controllers and the Clintons.
[01:16:04.925 --> 01:16:06.245]  You get a couple hundred people.
[01:16:06.245 --> 01:16:08.226]  You've got all the data on them.
[01:16:08.226 --> 01:16:10.487]  Their open statements are criminal.
[01:16:10.487 --> 01:16:12.767]  You indict them and just have a war.
[01:16:12.767 --> 01:16:14.088]  Let them dump all their dirt out.
[01:16:14.088 --> 01:16:15.268]  It doesn't matter.
[01:16:15.268 --> 01:16:16.749]  Indict them.
[01:16:16.749 --> 01:16:17.269]  Bring them in.
[01:16:18.775 --> 01:16:20.196]  Burn the whole thing down.
[01:16:20.196 --> 01:16:21.816]  Restore the Republic.
[01:16:21.816 --> 01:16:23.697]  Launch the Phoenix.
[01:16:23.697 --> 01:16:24.718]  Do it!
[01:16:24.718 --> 01:16:25.838]  Do it!
[01:16:25.838 --> 01:16:26.319]  Come on!
[01:16:26.319 --> 01:16:27.679]  Let's go!
[01:16:27.679 --> 01:16:29.020]  They wanna fight?
[01:16:29.020 --> 01:16:29.560]  You want one?
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:30.100]  Let's go!
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:32.481]  I want one too!
[01:16:32.481 --> 01:16:33.262]  You're gonna get one!
[01:16:33.262 --> 01:16:34.862]  You're already feeling one!
[01:16:34.862 --> 01:16:37.764]  So you just keep pushing it, you little pieces of crap!
[01:16:37.764 --> 01:16:44.027]  Because at the end of the day... You're not gonna be getting away with it anymore, are you?
[01:16:44.027 --> 01:16:46.648]  You think your wills are so strong, you have no idea.
[01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:52.055]  God bless Donald Trump and what he's done.
[01:16:52.055 --> 01:16:56.237]  God Almighty.
[01:16:56.237 --> 01:16:57.678]  You looked at Sessions getting sworn in.
[01:16:57.678 --> 01:16:59.238]  I've been watching Sessions for 20 years.
[01:16:59.238 --> 01:17:02.960]  I've never seen Sessions so freaked out and so scared.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.361]  Sessions was shaking because he knows he's gonna get the green light to go after him.
[01:17:07.361 --> 01:17:10.823]  And he knows he and his wife and his family are on the very front edge of that sucker.
[01:17:11.716 --> 01:17:12.377]  Let me tell you something.
[01:17:12.377 --> 01:17:14.258]  It's not scary when you're on the right edge of good.
[01:17:14.258 --> 01:17:22.105]  It's so strong when you start getting close to God, and God says, this is what I want you to do, and you know you're joining all the good people in history.
[01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:29.871]  It is the best thing in the universe, and it's something these devil worshipers will never understand, and they will never feel.
[01:17:39.255 --> 01:17:45.056]  I'm going to skip this break because I want to get to this part with Trump that they already grabbed out when he first responded to the media.
[01:17:45.056 --> 01:17:46.916]  And as strong as this is, it isn't strong enough.
[01:17:46.916 --> 01:17:48.577]  He needs to throw them all out of the White House.
[01:17:48.577 --> 01:17:49.917]  We're already in a civil war.
[01:17:49.917 --> 01:17:56.118]  Why keep pretending they're openly calling for his murder and overthrow on CNN?
[01:17:56.118 --> 01:18:00.359]  When you get to that point, you have to move!
[01:18:00.359 --> 01:18:02.119]  Go to the clip.
[01:18:02.119 --> 01:18:06.320]  Am I making this presentation directly to the American people?
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:08.420]  With the media present, which is an honor to have you.
[01:18:09.938 --> 01:18:22.302]  This morning because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve.
[01:18:22.302 --> 01:18:29.144]  And I hope going forward we can be a little bit a little bit different and maybe get along a little bit better if that's possible.
[01:18:29.144 --> 01:18:31.685]  Maybe it's not and that's okay too.
[01:18:31.685 --> 01:18:39.307]  Unfortunately much of the media in Washington DC along with New York, Los Angeles in particular speaks not for the people
[01:18:40.353 --> 01:18:47.637]  But for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system.
[01:18:47.637 --> 01:18:48.678]  Hit pause.
[01:18:48.678 --> 01:18:49.178]  Back this up.
[01:18:49.178 --> 01:18:49.958]  This is so epic.
[01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:50.719]  This is back it up.
[01:18:50.719 --> 01:18:51.940]  Start at the beginning.
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:54.681]  He's declaring the criminal cities where the mafias are.
[01:18:54.681 --> 01:19:03.046]  New York, which he knows, and built his empire to spite them, and L.A., who just are out to hurt us and hate us.
[01:19:03.046 --> 01:19:05.127]  And he goes, I'd like to work with you.
[01:19:05.127 --> 01:19:06.708]  I'd like you to run up the white flag.
[01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:07.889]  All I'll do is give you prosperity.
[01:19:08.749 --> 01:19:11.611]  But I'm sorry, we're not going to have child kidnapping and murder rings.
[01:19:11.611 --> 01:19:13.092]  I mean, he's just telling you this.
[01:19:13.092 --> 01:19:14.033]  Listen, it's going to stop.
[01:19:14.033 --> 01:19:14.453]  It's over.
[01:19:14.453 --> 01:19:15.654]  You wanted to kill the country.
[01:19:15.654 --> 01:19:17.735]  You wanted to bring the world into depression, have wars.
[01:19:17.735 --> 01:19:18.596]  We're not suicidal.
[01:19:18.596 --> 01:19:19.656]  That's all this is.
[01:19:19.656 --> 01:19:21.658]  You know, but you don't want that?
[01:19:21.658 --> 01:19:24.119]  Okay.
[01:19:24.119 --> 01:19:25.200]  So I trust Trump.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:27.882]  I, you know, he knows what to do.
[01:19:27.882 --> 01:19:30.003]  It's just that this, this is, this is hardcore folks.
[01:19:30.003 --> 01:19:32.985]  The energy level is a hundred times what I've ever felt.
[01:19:32.985 --> 01:19:33.506]  Okay.
[01:19:34.776 --> 01:19:35.437]  I can't even eat.
[01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.238]  I haven't even eaten.
[01:19:37.238 --> 01:19:39.300]  I mean, I see all the data.
[01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:40.341]  I know what they're planning.
[01:19:40.341 --> 01:19:42.222]  And then all over the world, nationalism is exploding.
[01:19:42.222 --> 01:19:43.223]  They're losing!
[01:19:43.223 --> 01:19:45.705]  That's why it's so dangerous.
[01:19:45.705 --> 01:19:46.946]  Let's continue with the President from the start.
[01:19:46.946 --> 01:19:49.468]  Sorry.
[01:19:49.468 --> 01:20:00.917]  This morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve,
[01:20:01.798 --> 01:20:08.641]  And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different and maybe get along a little bit better if that's possible.
[01:20:08.641 --> 01:20:11.182]  Maybe it's not, and that's okay too.
[01:20:11.182 --> 01:20:18.826]  Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people.
[01:20:19.858 --> 01:20:38.871]  But for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system, the press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people.
[01:20:38.871 --> 01:20:39.952]  Tremendous disservice.
[01:20:39.952 --> 01:20:44.735]  We have to talk about it to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control.
[01:20:44.735 --> 01:20:46.717]  The level of dishonesty is out of control.
[01:20:48.334 --> 01:20:52.358]  I ran for president to represent the citizens of our country.
[01:20:52.358 --> 01:20:59.304]  I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well.
[01:20:59.304 --> 01:21:10.094]  I am talking and really talking on this very entrenched power structure and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure.
[01:21:10.094 --> 01:21:11.816]  We're talking about its entrenchment.
[01:21:12.719 --> 01:21:22.381]  As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort, not all the time, and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say.
[01:21:22.381 --> 01:21:24.462]  They're honest and fantastic.
[01:21:24.462 --> 01:21:27.943]  But much of it is not the distortion.
[01:21:27.943 --> 01:21:28.743]  And we'll talk about it.
[01:21:28.743 --> 01:21:31.764]  You'll be able to ask me questions about it.
[01:21:31.764 --> 01:21:37.665]  But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again to take my message straight to the people.
[01:21:37.665 --> 01:21:41.046]  As you know, our administration inherited many problems.
[01:21:42.125 --> 01:21:45.686]  Across government and across the economy.
[01:21:45.686 --> 01:21:50.767]  To be honest, I inherited a mess.
[01:21:50.767 --> 01:21:53.728]  It's a mess.
[01:21:53.728 --> 01:21:55.468]  At home and abroad.
[01:21:55.468 --> 01:21:57.709]  A mess.
[01:21:57.709 --> 01:22:00.110]  Jobs are pouring out of the country.
[01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:05.491]  You see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places.
[01:22:06.778 --> 01:22:12.383]  Low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look.
[01:22:12.383 --> 01:22:13.964]  The Middle East, a disaster.
[01:22:13.964 --> 01:22:16.766]  North Korea, we'll take care of it, folks.
[01:22:16.766 --> 01:22:18.448]  We're going to take care of it all.
[01:22:18.448 --> 01:22:22.691]  I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess.
[01:22:22.691 --> 01:22:29.777]  Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges.
[01:22:29.777 --> 01:22:35.482]  On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you've covered.
[01:22:36.462 --> 01:22:45.210]  To move forward towards stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, of which there are many.
[01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:49.793]  We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom and meetings.
[01:22:49.793 --> 01:22:53.757]  Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada.
[01:22:53.757 --> 01:22:57.280]  Really, really productive conversations.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:01.984]  I would say far more productive than you would understand.
[01:23:01.984 --> 01:23:03.966]  We've even developed a new council
[01:23:05.342 --> 01:23:09.463]  With Canada, to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs.
[01:23:09.463 --> 01:23:13.425]  Very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.
[01:23:13.425 --> 01:23:21.787]  I have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis.
[01:23:21.787 --> 01:23:24.768]  He's over there now, working very hard.
[01:23:24.768 --> 01:23:28.690]  To submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS.
[01:23:28.690 --> 01:23:32.691]  A group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people,
[01:23:33.877 --> 01:23:35.778]  In large sections of the world.
[01:23:35.778 --> 01:23:40.381]  Used to be a small group, now it's in large sections of the world.
[01:23:40.381 --> 01:23:43.463]  They've spread like cancer.
[01:23:43.463 --> 01:23:47.386]  ISIS has spread like cancer.
[01:23:47.386 --> 01:23:50.168]  Another mess I inherited.
[01:23:50.168 --> 01:23:58.033]  And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who's totally taken advantage of our previous administration.
[01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:02.356]  And they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism.
[01:24:02.356 --> 01:24:03.337]  And we're not gonna stop.
[01:24:05.734 --> 01:24:07.836]  Until that problem is properly solved.
[01:24:07.836 --> 01:24:09.677]  And it's not properly solved now.
[01:24:09.677 --> 01:24:13.560]  It's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:18.323]  I've ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military.
[01:24:18.323 --> 01:24:21.906]  I've had great support from the Senate.
[01:24:21.906 --> 01:24:25.629]  I've had great support from Congress, generally.
[01:24:25.629 --> 01:24:33.574]  We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military.
[01:24:33.574 --> 01:24:33.695]  And
[01:24:34.867 --> 01:24:50.346]  I will tell you, that is my, I would be so happy if we never had to use it, but our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild.
[01:24:51.581 --> 01:24:59.287]  We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment, and their equipment is old.
[01:24:59.287 --> 01:25:00.548]  I used it.
[01:25:00.548 --> 01:25:03.410]  I talked about it at every stop.
[01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:03.971]  Depleted.
[01:25:03.971 --> 01:25:05.892]  It's depleted.
[01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:08.514]  Won't be depleted for long.
[01:25:08.514 --> 01:25:12.418]  And I think one of the reasons I'm standing here instead of other people is that
[01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:16.200]  Frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.201]  We have to have strong law enforcement also.
[01:25:18.201 --> 01:25:19.802]  All right, let's stop right there.
[01:25:19.802 --> 01:25:22.803]  So we do not go... There's more of the press conference coming up.
[01:25:22.803 --> 01:25:26.485]  That's from about 10 minutes ago, because we can obviously go back to the beginning.
[01:25:26.485 --> 01:25:29.607]  And we'll have some of the excerpts for you of some of the press conference.
[01:25:29.607 --> 01:25:33.529]  We have a live feed of it at InfoWars.com if you want to look at it.
[01:25:33.529 --> 01:25:37.752]  The reason I got so upset is things couldn't be more historical.
[01:25:37.752 --> 01:25:39.833]  Never in the history of the world has something gone on like this.
[01:25:39.833 --> 01:25:41.614]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:25:42.805 --> 01:25:53.988]  And never before have we had such crazed, crazy, evil, corrupt people in charge who were so arrogant that the outgoing CIA director told the President, watch his mouth.
[01:25:53.988 --> 01:25:58.749]  I mean, this is just total belligerence by the hijackers of this country.
[01:25:58.749 --> 01:26:11.552]  I want to be clear, whether it's the NSA or the CIA or Defense Intelligence or on and on and on, it's just people like you and I. But when you get into these globalists and these neocons and these leftists,
[01:26:12.694 --> 01:26:15.055]  They all support world government.
[01:26:15.055 --> 01:26:21.299]  And they all want to be the technocrat class that serves the big mega banks, serves the big Googles.
[01:26:21.299 --> 01:26:23.900]  And the rest of us just don't exist.
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:26.662]  They're a bunch of very, very selfish, very, very evil people.
[01:26:27.603 --> 01:26:36.229]  And it'd be one thing if they were like super strong and doing some great things and inventing all this stuff and then they said, oh, you're all ugly, we're going to kill you.
[01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:38.270]  I'd still fight back because I want to survive.
[01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:45.075]  It's like they're the worst scum that snuck in and used our goodwill and our blind spot to hijack civilization.
[01:26:45.075 --> 01:26:46.796]  And now we're telling us we don't have a place in the future.
[01:26:46.796 --> 01:26:49.638]  Hey, I got a little newsflash for you.
[01:26:49.638 --> 01:26:51.059]  If you want me to die.
[01:26:51.059 --> 01:26:56.483]  No, no, no, you will die.
[01:26:57.881 --> 01:26:59.302]  I don't mean that as some physical threat.
[01:26:59.302 --> 01:27:02.364]  I don't say things I don't then carry out or attempt to carry out.
[01:27:02.364 --> 01:27:08.108]  I'm saying metaphysically, historically, those that live by the sword, die by the sword.
[01:27:08.108 --> 01:27:10.889]  That doesn't just mean if you are in the military you're going to die by the sword.
[01:27:10.889 --> 01:27:14.632]  It means if you live by it, you're out taking with it.
[01:27:14.632 --> 01:27:19.235]  So I'm putting the word out and then God's going to take care of everything.
[01:27:19.235 --> 01:27:21.336]  But that means working through men and women.
[01:27:23.547 --> 01:27:28.810]  Then said Jesus unto them, Put up again thy sword into his place.
[01:27:28.810 --> 01:27:33.393]  For all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
[01:27:33.393 --> 01:27:35.555]  They also said, Go forth and buy a sword.
[01:27:35.555 --> 01:27:37.276]  So it's all very sophisticated.
[01:27:37.276 --> 01:27:39.477]  You have to have discernment to understand it.
[01:27:39.477 --> 01:27:43.340]  It's written so that the profane or the wicked ones don't understand it.
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:44.861]  And to them it's all a big joke.
[01:27:44.861 --> 01:27:47.643]  You can pull up those Bible verses as well.
[01:27:49.178 --> 01:27:51.498]  He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity.
[01:27:51.498 --> 01:27:54.299]  He that killeth with a sword must be killed with a sword.
[01:27:54.299 --> 01:27:56.779]  Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
[01:27:56.779 --> 01:27:59.180]  That's King James, Revelation 13 10.
[01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:10.862]  I'm not speaking about specifically bondage and enslavement by the Antichrist forces against Christians.
[01:28:10.862 --> 01:28:16.623]  Make no mistake, all of this is preparation for humanity to face much bigger threats.
[01:28:16.623 --> 01:28:18.223]  If we have victory over this at this point,
[01:28:19.235 --> 01:28:25.909]  Still, there are much greater threats coming down the road, but this is an example of the ebb and flow and history of good and evil.
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.101]  You know, it says, is Twitter censoring positive replies to Donald Trump's tweets?
[01:28:34.101 --> 01:28:35.362]  Paul Watson's done his article.
[01:28:35.362 --> 01:28:37.523]  I mean, I've talked to people that know about Twitter and how it works.
[01:28:37.523 --> 01:28:38.283]  I just know how to use it.
[01:28:38.283 --> 01:28:41.524]  I'm not, I call myself like on a scale of 1 to 10 knowing how Twitter works, maybe a 2.
[01:28:41.524 --> 01:28:45.066]  But I've talked to Twitter experts, they say it's definitely going on.
[01:28:45.066 --> 01:28:50.108]  They just put the negative ones at the top and then, you know, so that way he doesn't respond to people.
[01:28:50.108 --> 01:28:55.270]  He says, Twitter appears to be censoring positive replies to President Donald Trump's tweets and only showing negative responses.
[01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:57.131]  Yeah, this has been going on for weeks.
[01:28:57.131 --> 01:28:57.911]  I've gone back and looked.
[01:28:59.318 --> 01:29:02.402]  So Paul documents all that.
[01:29:02.402 --> 01:29:14.477]  I'm going to take liberty and just point out that we should probably change the headline and say clear evidence shows they're censoring the responses to his tweets and manipulating his Twitter account.
[01:29:14.477 --> 01:29:16.259]  That's really the big issue is they're manipulating
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:23.947]  The Twitter account, they've got screenshots of all this, and they admit they're starting to gauge everything and govern it and manipulate it.
[01:29:23.947 --> 01:29:24.969]  I mean, it's been going on a while.
[01:29:24.969 --> 01:29:29.013]  Now they're just rolling it out, which means even more worse stuff's about to happen.
[01:29:29.013 --> 01:29:35.820]  We're going to come back with our special guest getting into General Flynn and how it was tied into Pizzagate straight ahead.
[01:29:36.917 --> 01:29:39.100]  And please support us and spread the links in the articles.
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:42.183]  They may try to censor us on big platforms, but we're huge as well.
[01:29:42.183 --> 01:29:49.772]  So spread those links from InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and spread the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show so folks can find the broadcast.
[01:30:00.427 --> 01:30:02.268]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:30:02.268 --> 01:30:08.870]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:12.031]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[01:30:12.031 --> 01:30:21.814]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[01:30:21.814 --> 01:30:22.655]  Caveman.
[01:30:22.655 --> 01:30:27.716]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[01:30:27.716 --> 01:30:29.837]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:30:30.137 --> 01:30:33.278]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:30:33.278 --> 01:30:38.418]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:30:38.418 --> 01:30:46.560]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:54.421]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[01:30:54.421 --> 01:30:59.162]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in fourwarslife.com today.

[01:31:30.458 --> 01:31:33.020]  We use cell phones against our heads every day.
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.421]  But now a landmark U.S.
[01:31:34.421 --> 01:31:40.045]  government study confirms increased health risks from exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[01:32:00.206 --> 01:32:03.288]  Extendovite is more than just a heart tonic.
[01:32:03.288 --> 01:32:05.349]  Do you have any of these symptoms?
[01:32:05.349 --> 01:32:07.150]  Night cramps in the hands and feet.
[01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:09.391]  Your arms and legs often go to sleep.
[01:32:09.391 --> 01:32:12.092]  On short walks, do your legs get aches and pains?
[01:32:12.092 --> 01:32:14.233]  Is your memory worse than it used to be?
[01:32:14.233 --> 01:32:16.094]  Ankles that swell late in the day.
[01:32:16.094 --> 01:32:17.835]  Has your blood pressure increased lately?
[01:32:18.135 --> 01:32:24.720]  If you answered yes to even one of these questions, you may have early warning signs of arterial blockages.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:28.142]  Your body is saying that it is time to take Xtendivite.
[01:32:28.142 --> 01:32:30.424]  These are not the normal signs of aging.
[01:32:30.424 --> 01:32:33.746]  They are the warning signs that accompany blocked arteries.

[01:33:16.924 --> 01:33:22.432]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:22.432 --> 01:33:27.138]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.689 --> 01:33:37.711]  We're going to talk to former CIA field operative.
[01:33:37.711 --> 01:33:40.893]  That means he wasn't just one of the little analysts up there calling for Trump's overthrow.
[01:33:40.893 --> 01:33:42.314]  He's a tough guy.
[01:33:42.314 --> 01:33:46.136]  He's going to be breaking down just the whole waterfront.
[01:33:46.136 --> 01:33:47.457]  I don't know all of his views on this.
[01:33:47.457 --> 01:33:48.157]  I've read some of it.
[01:33:48.157 --> 01:33:49.538]  It's pretty controversial.
[01:33:49.538 --> 01:33:52.419]  A lot of it ties into information I know is true, so I respect the guy.
[01:33:52.419 --> 01:33:53.120]  I think he's a good guy.
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:58.403]  We're going to get his take on this and how Flynn's resignation ties into the whole battle.
[01:33:58.863 --> 01:33:59.983]  To take out the pedophiles.
[01:33:59.983 --> 01:34:01.904]  I know Flynn was pushing for that.
[01:34:01.904 --> 01:34:03.184]  So is Sessions and others.
[01:34:03.184 --> 01:34:07.125]  You see the pedophiles getting rolled up around the country and around the world.
[01:34:07.125 --> 01:34:08.626]  We told you that was coming.
[01:34:08.626 --> 01:34:11.206]  So there is a huge civil war inside the government going on right now.
[01:34:11.206 --> 01:34:13.527]  It's very sophisticated.
[01:34:13.527 --> 01:34:16.068]  And Trump is playing basically 4-5-D chess.
[01:34:16.068 --> 01:34:17.128]  We'll see where all this goes.
[01:34:17.128 --> 01:34:19.189]  We're going to be talking to our guest here in just a moment.
[01:34:22.145 --> 01:34:28.309]  I was researching the very best stuff for joints and muscles as I get older and I work out, sometimes my joints hurt.
[01:34:28.309 --> 01:34:33.133]  And the biggest, hottest thing, obviously, is bone broth and collagen.
[01:34:33.133 --> 01:34:34.954]  And I said, well, let's go out and produce that.
[01:34:34.954 --> 01:34:39.878]  And we found out the other leading competitors might put $3 of stuff in their can and sell it for $50.
[01:34:40.658 --> 01:34:41.598]  Well, that's not what we do.
[01:34:41.598 --> 01:34:45.320]  We load it with the very best, cleanest collagens out there.
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:46.780]  That comes from chickens, folks.
[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:48.401]  Beef could have some issues.
[01:34:48.401 --> 01:34:53.502]  Bone broth, paleo ingredients, you name it, it is all in there.
[01:34:53.502 --> 01:34:54.783]  Alfalfa herb powder.
[01:34:56.083 --> 01:34:59.125]  We've got the multi-collagen complex.
[01:34:59.125 --> 01:35:02.328]  We've got the chonga mushroom.
[01:35:02.328 --> 01:35:03.528]  We've got the bee pollen.
[01:35:03.528 --> 01:35:05.950]  The turmeric root is the big one.
[01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:11.134]  That helps accelerate all of the different ingredients, obviously, into the body, into the bloodstream, and clean out the cells.
[01:35:11.134 --> 01:35:13.855]  Turmeric's well-known for all the amazing things it does.
[01:35:14.755 --> 01:35:16.157]  This is a big dose of it.
[01:35:16.157 --> 01:35:19.162]  Now, this is a little bit of cocoa and a little bit of stevia and it tastes great.
[01:35:19.162 --> 01:35:22.428]  If you mix it with milk, it's even better, but a lot of folks want to be skinny.
[01:35:22.428 --> 01:35:28.278]  But I've been taking it with milk, but my joints and everything have just, I mean, it's been miraculous, the few areas that were hurting, what it's done.
[01:35:29.474 --> 01:35:33.758]  It's the best out there, and it's less priced than many of the competitors as well.
[01:35:33.758 --> 01:35:43.128]  And if you go back to what humans were doing 10,000 years ago, here's a Daily Mail article, how modern humans have become weaklings compared to our ancient ancestors, who could outrun and outlive today's top athletes.
[01:35:43.128 --> 01:35:44.489]  Just the average person could.
[01:35:44.489 --> 01:35:50.295]  They dig up bodies in what's England today, or what's Nigeria today, and the anthropologists.
[01:35:51.176 --> 01:35:52.937]  Archaeologists find the same deal.
[01:35:52.937 --> 01:35:54.298]  This is well-known.
[01:35:54.298 --> 01:36:02.202]  Man's intelligence, human's intelligence peaked thousands of years ago, and we've been on an intellectual and emotional and physical decline ever since then.
[01:36:02.202 --> 01:36:05.143]  And one of the big things they believe is people aren't grinding up bones.
[01:36:05.143 --> 01:36:06.324]  Used to grind it up, put it in bread.
[01:36:06.324 --> 01:36:08.024]  It's called the minerals, trace elements.
[01:36:08.024 --> 01:36:10.506]  The bone marrow is full of stem cells.
[01:36:10.506 --> 01:36:12.687]  Even if it's desiccated, it gets into your body.
[01:36:12.687 --> 01:36:14.428]  It does amazing, amazing things.
[01:36:15.208 --> 01:36:15.808]  Chicken broth.
[01:36:15.808 --> 01:36:18.490]  These have the chicken bones in it, you know, when you have the flu or whatever.
[01:36:18.490 --> 01:36:20.112]  Well, this is like a mega dose of that.
[01:36:20.112 --> 01:36:23.494]  A little scoop in there with your water or whatever at lunch.
[01:36:23.494 --> 01:36:27.317]  I'm going to take some of this next hour for my lunch.
[01:36:27.317 --> 01:36:34.162]  So again, Caveman True Paleo Formula available at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:36:34.162 --> 01:36:35.903]  And I want to thank you all for your support.

[01:36:45.730 --> 01:36:49.273]  And we just private label and have our own proprietary blend made with those added.

[01:37:02.944 --> 01:37:08.689]  This is how we break the back of the big corporations that want to control us by their corporate sponsorships.
[01:37:09.747 --> 01:37:13.332]  We have the model that's dominating the media and no one else, I guess, knows how to figure out how to do it.
[01:37:13.332 --> 01:37:14.894]  I'm not bragging, it's actually crazy.
[01:37:14.894 --> 01:37:16.195]  I want to see other people pick this up.
[01:37:16.195 --> 01:37:18.178]  Direct sales to your audience.
[01:37:18.178 --> 01:37:20.380]  So it's a movement, voting with your dollars.
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:26.969]  So whether it's Brain Force or X2 or Super Bowl Vitality or Methylcobalamin, vitamin B12 under the tongue, secret 12 or a biome defense, very
[01:37:30.352 --> 01:37:31.853]  It's amazing these strains.
[01:37:31.853 --> 01:37:36.477]  Vitamin, mineral, fusion, amino acid, fruit punch drink, knockout sleep aid.
[01:37:36.477 --> 01:37:41.202]  We just take the 10 best known healthy sleep aids like valerian root, melatonin, you name it.
[01:37:41.202 --> 01:37:43.504]  Put it in one powerful pill.
[01:37:43.504 --> 01:37:45.266]  Watch out if you take two of them though.
[01:37:45.266 --> 01:37:46.807]  It's all over the counter.
[01:37:46.807 --> 01:37:48.569]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:53.174 --> 01:37:53.995]  Breaking!
[01:37:53.995 --> 01:37:56.696]  We have reporters in DC.
[01:37:56.696 --> 01:37:58.017]  I'm tempted to try to get them all next hour.
[01:37:58.017 --> 01:38:01.199]  We have a Washington Post reporter coming on tomorrow.
[01:38:01.199 --> 01:38:02.059]  We've got a Washington...
[01:38:05.359 --> 01:38:11.343]  A reporter, Jerome Corsi, with Muslim sympathizers at CIA behind Trump leaks.
[01:38:11.343 --> 01:38:14.445]  And then we've also got a New York Post reporter coming on next hour.
[01:38:14.445 --> 01:38:19.989]  How Obama is scheming to sabotage Trump presidency with a bunker and 30,000 activists.
[01:38:19.989 --> 01:38:29.096]  And we now have CIA operatives that have been involved in covert actions, the type to overthrow countries, coming out saying that Trump is, quote, a domestic enemy, Evan McMullin.
[01:38:29.096 --> 01:38:33.659]  He fits the cast of these guys who never actually, he's commanded people, but never been out in the field like steel.
[01:38:34.199 --> 01:38:48.211]  And I'm not knocking guys in combat, I haven't been, you know, just as a citizen, but I'm so sick of them always running around calling for overthrows, murder, death, you know, corruption, watch your mouth, like Brennan said.
[01:38:48.211 --> 01:38:51.033]  I don't know everything Steele's going to get into.
[01:38:51.033 --> 01:38:55.497]  I got some articles of his, and I read them yesterday, and it's pretty shocking stuff.
[01:38:55.497 --> 01:39:00.601]  I just had them here in my stack, and we'll put some of those up on screen for folks, but
[01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:08.528]  He's saying it all ties in to the pedophiles and more, so we'll get his breakdown on that right now.
[01:39:08.528 --> 01:39:11.650]  Robert David Steele, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:39:11.650 --> 01:39:15.714]  You've got a bunch of websites, which one's best for folks to visit?
[01:39:15.714 --> 01:39:19.137]  RobertDavidSteele.com is the easiest to remember.
[01:39:19.137 --> 01:39:24.081]  PhiBetaIota.net is the one with all the good stuff.
[01:39:24.081 --> 01:39:27.644]  It's the one with all the posts from 80 people that I curate.
[01:39:30.097 --> 01:39:33.920]  Well, again, I read like three of your articles this morning, and I don't even know where to start.
[01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.841]  It makes my head spin.
[01:39:35.841 --> 01:39:37.462]  Let's just lay it out.
[01:39:37.462 --> 01:39:39.504]  Lay out the information.
[01:39:39.504 --> 01:39:42.906]  Let's start with McMullin's the lightweight.
[01:39:42.906 --> 01:39:48.850]  This is a little man who's got no serious credibility in either the intelligence community or the real world.
[01:39:48.850 --> 01:39:49.971]  He's just running his mouth.
[01:39:52.635 --> 01:40:01.058]  I happen to be a complete independent, and I believe that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
[01:40:01.058 --> 01:40:11.080]  And you and Gary Noll and a whole bunch of important people are starting to talk about how Donald Trump might be our one chance to take down the deep state.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:12.561]  I absolutely believe that.
[01:40:13.081 --> 01:40:14.782]  Now, I've published some posts.
[01:40:14.782 --> 01:40:31.190]  Part of Trump's problem is that he wasn't expecting to win, and when he won by accident, I've written, it's both free online and it's also a bestseller at Kindle, Donald Trump, the accidental president, analyzes how he won at the very end, because Clinton collapsed in multiple ways.
[01:40:31.190 --> 01:40:34.671]  Well, and because the intelligence agencies wanted him to win.
[01:40:34.671 --> 01:40:37.152]  Well, no, actually, some of us within the intelligence agencies wanted him to win.
[01:40:37.152 --> 01:40:37.793]  Well, no, exactly.
[01:40:37.793 --> 01:40:39.854]  I'm not saying everybody, but the people that weren't at the top.
[01:40:41.004 --> 01:40:51.447]  Yeah, well, there was a huge fight between John Brennan, who was representing Hillary Clinton, Wall Street, the Deep State, and the Saudis, and the rest of us.
[01:40:51.447 --> 01:40:53.927]  And Steve Piesnack's one of my favorite people.
[01:40:53.927 --> 01:40:56.028]  He announced that there were white hats.
[01:40:56.028 --> 01:41:02.730]  The white hats were able to stop Hillary Clinton from using the same electronic fraud that she used against Bernie Sanders.
[01:41:02.730 --> 01:41:03.710]  She stole 13 primaries.
[01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:06.011]  From Bernie Sanders.
[01:41:06.011 --> 01:41:08.672]  That was confirmed by Stanford University.
[01:41:08.672 --> 01:41:16.715]  They were able to stop that and she wasn't able to steal 13 general elections from Donald Trump.
[01:41:16.715 --> 01:41:24.198]  But coming back to Donald Trump, his problem was that he had to get from election day to inauguration day.
[01:41:24.838 --> 01:41:30.883]  And he had to get through the Electoral College, the Congressional Validation and Inauguration Day.
[01:41:30.883 --> 01:41:38.589]  And as you all saw, John Brennan committed treason by telling lies intended to overturn the Electoral College.
[01:41:38.589 --> 01:41:45.555]  And we've never seen a CIA... I mean, in the past, if a CIA director said to the President, keep your mouth shut, they would die in a canoeing accident within hours.
[01:41:45.555 --> 01:41:46.636]  And I'm not even saying do that.
[01:41:46.636 --> 01:41:48.037]  It's just, this is unprecedented.
[01:41:48.593 --> 01:41:49.813]  It is unprecedented.
[01:41:49.813 --> 01:41:58.176]  John Brennan is, in my view, until he resigned and maybe still today, the highest paid agent of Saudi Arabia.
[01:41:58.176 --> 01:42:03.937]  John Brennan is corrupt to the bone and he should be under deep FBI investigation.
[01:42:03.937 --> 01:42:05.478]  But set him aside.
[01:42:05.478 --> 01:42:07.218]  Donald Trump is there now.
[01:42:07.218 --> 01:42:17.101]  The point I'm trying to make is that to get from Election Day to Inauguration Day, Trump had to make some deals and Reince Priebus, the Judas in the White House, was part of that.
[01:42:17.421 --> 01:42:17.841]  I agree.
[01:42:17.841 --> 01:42:20.984]  In fact, a lot of really smart, top people say that's Trump's big mistake.
[01:42:20.984 --> 01:42:23.806]  He thought he could co-opt them because they just wanted power.
[01:42:23.806 --> 01:42:26.289]  And instead, no, they've got, there's dirt on them.
[01:42:26.289 --> 01:42:27.690]  They're part of something bigger.
[01:42:27.690 --> 01:42:29.772]  And that's why Trump's got to get rid of them.
[01:42:29.772 --> 01:42:34.736]  Priebus is, among other things, an enabler and cover-upper of pedophilia.
[01:42:34.736 --> 01:42:37.338]  Dennis Hassard is the tip of the iceberg.
[01:42:37.338 --> 01:42:44.444]  I absolutely guarantee you that Julian Assange is going to take down the Republican Party and rent Priebus specifically.
[01:42:44.444 --> 01:42:45.004]  Let me just stop you.
[01:42:47.046 --> 01:42:49.868]  This is shocking right now because I've had you on for a decade.
[01:42:49.868 --> 01:42:54.931]  You're very respected and involved in clandestine operations all over the Middle East, all over the world.
[01:42:54.931 --> 01:42:57.072]  And I know you wouldn't just say this because this opens you up to a lot.
[01:42:57.072 --> 01:42:58.533]  Now, I'm not saying this is your opinion.
[01:42:58.533 --> 01:43:03.156]  I'm saying you're a guest on my show saying this right now because the media... Oh, Alex, don't be chicken.
[01:43:03.156 --> 01:43:04.557]  Well, no, no, listen, I'm not chicken.
[01:43:04.557 --> 01:43:05.838]  I know about Hastert.
[01:43:05.838 --> 01:43:07.579]  I know about his connections to the Clintons.
[01:43:07.579 --> 01:43:08.920]  I know about the whole network.
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:09.480]  I know it's true.
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:10.741]  Listen, this is on me.
[01:43:10.741 --> 01:43:11.401]  This is on me.
[01:43:11.401 --> 01:43:12.342]  This is not on you.
[01:43:12.642 --> 01:43:14.704]  This is on me, okay?
[01:43:14.704 --> 01:43:18.187]  Here's my Marine Corps cereal ring.
[01:43:18.187 --> 01:43:20.590]  This is on me.
[01:43:20.590 --> 01:43:28.818]  I have, for over a decade, been working with a number of people on pedophilia as an elite privilege.
[01:43:28.818 --> 01:43:32.301]  For the Democrats, it's actually an acquired taste.
[01:43:32.301 --> 01:43:34.703]  John Podesta is a pedophile light.
[01:43:36.892 --> 01:43:44.755]  The Republicans and the elite in banking are the ones who have really made this a big league thing.
[01:43:44.755 --> 01:43:49.217]  There are Saudi Arabian restaurants with basements in Washington D.C.
[01:43:49.217 --> 01:43:51.778]  where you can order children on the menu.
[01:43:51.778 --> 01:43:52.119]  Okay?
[01:43:52.119 --> 01:43:53.519]  This is what I have been told.
[01:43:53.519 --> 01:43:55.320]  I have not been to one of those restaurants.
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.521]  I've never ordered a child on the menu.
[01:43:58.677 --> 01:44:03.781]  Pedophilia is the Achilles heel and Donald Trump has figured that out.
[01:44:03.781 --> 01:44:07.204]  Now, Flynn did not get fired because he called the Russians.
[01:44:07.204 --> 01:44:17.472]  I would remind your viewers that Henry Kissinger sabotaged the Paris peace talks and killed another 20,000 US troops and hundreds of thousands of others.
[01:44:18.462 --> 01:44:21.223]  Just to help Richard Nixon get elected.
[01:44:21.223 --> 01:44:27.726]  Hillary Clinton sold Syria and Yemen to Saudi Arabia for tens of millions of dollars.
[01:44:27.726 --> 01:44:35.190]  Flynn got fired because he had the arrogance to think that he could tell Mattis and Tillerson what to do.
[01:44:35.190 --> 01:44:38.692]  He also managed to piss off the Vice President.
[01:44:39.512 --> 01:44:54.482]  Flynn's call included, and this is insider information, Flynn's call included a conversation about a list of high-level pedophiles in the United States, one of whom is Mike Pence's best friend.
[01:44:54.482 --> 01:44:56.304]  And Flynn did not tell Pence.
[01:44:57.469 --> 01:44:59.430]  That eventually came out.
[01:44:59.430 --> 01:45:18.723]  Now the real issue, as Dennis Kucinich has very carefully pointed out on Fox, the real issue is that NSA has been spying on all of our politicians with impunity and the CIA is leaking highly classified information as part of a political coup d'etat.
[01:45:18.723 --> 01:45:24.847]  If I were in Donald Trump's shoes, I would be shutting NSA down.
[01:45:24.847 --> 01:45:26.748]  NSA has no legislative charter.
[01:45:27.964 --> 01:45:31.546]  Donald Trump has the power to shut NSA down tomorrow.
[01:45:31.546 --> 01:45:36.209]  Let's be clear, it's clearly illegal what's going on and the leaks are illegal, but let me ask you this then.
[01:45:36.209 --> 01:45:40.892]  I've known you 10 years or 12 years, you wouldn't be saying this if you didn't at least have the sources.
[01:45:40.892 --> 01:45:45.495]  Clearly they're trying to overthrow Trump right now.
[01:45:45.495 --> 01:45:47.756]  All this crazy stuff's going on.
[01:45:47.756 --> 01:45:51.739]  Who are the main power blocks in your view and how is it going in the war against Trump?
[01:45:52.938 --> 01:45:58.043]  All of your smart viewers know what a tiny URL is.
[01:45:58.043 --> 01:46:14.157]  So at tinyurl.com forward slash memo number four Trump, memo for Trump, is my memorandum to Donald Trump, which is, I am told, now in Trump's hands, in Steve Bannon's hands, and possibly in Kellyanne Conway's hands.
[01:46:14.157 --> 01:46:14.418]  All right?
[01:46:15.484 --> 01:46:18.847]  Trump has three major enemy groups.
[01:46:18.847 --> 01:46:29.917]  Enemy group number one is George Sotos, Tom Steyer, and other billionaires who are behind what is going to be a violent American spring.
[01:46:29.917 --> 01:46:38.885]  The American spring is going to begin as soon as the weather gets nice with tens of thousands of paid agitators across the country.
[01:46:39.850 --> 01:46:46.320]  And it is going to end with 3 million people being bused into Washington D.C.
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:49.665]  on May Day, on the 1st of May.
[01:46:49.665 --> 01:46:54.713]  And they're testing their databases right now with these fake women marches, and even fusing it with Islam.
[01:46:55.384 --> 01:46:56.245]  Yes.
[01:46:56.245 --> 01:47:02.290]  Alex, you've covered this and you know what I'm talking about, but I don't think people are really understanding.
[01:47:02.290 --> 01:47:07.794]  And unfortunately, Trump doesn't have advisers who are very broad in nature.
[01:47:07.794 --> 01:47:11.637]  I love Steve Bannon, but I've recommended that Steve Bannon... Well, he's overwhelmed.
[01:47:11.637 --> 01:47:13.018]  He's also getting isolated.
[01:47:13.018 --> 01:47:15.240]  But I don't want to... Let's go through the points.
[01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:17.182]  So obviously, they're going to have a three million mark.
[01:47:17.182 --> 01:47:18.102]  They admit that.
[01:47:18.102 --> 01:47:20.444]  They're going to burn everything down.
[01:47:20.444 --> 01:47:23.627]  But it's not just the left that's trying to kill Donald Trump.
[01:47:23.627 --> 01:47:24.648]  The right-wing Republicans.
[01:47:25.438 --> 01:47:28.601]  Dick Cheney is still Darth Vader.
[01:47:28.601 --> 01:47:32.525]  Dick Cheney is orchestrating penetrations of the government.
[01:47:32.525 --> 01:47:47.701]  And in fact, I've recommended to Trump that he fire the Director of the Office of Presidential Personnel, DeStefano, who was put in there by Priebus specifically to front-load all of Donald Trump's political appointees with moles from the establishment.
[01:47:48.422 --> 01:48:01.715]  Dick Cheney is hijacking this government just as he hijacked the government of George Bush, and I would point your listeners, your viewers, to a book called Vice, Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency.
[01:48:01.715 --> 01:48:08.061]  The third enemy group that Donald Trump is facing is the Deep State, which is the
[01:48:09.022 --> 01:48:10.544]  The traitors.
[01:48:10.544 --> 01:48:20.513]  I think there's 500 of them across the United States government who have sold out for money, for ideology, or for religion.
[01:48:20.513 --> 01:48:21.194]  All right?
[01:48:21.194 --> 01:48:29.381]  There are three different groups that are after Donald Trump, and there are three things Donald Trump has to do to survive the next 90 days.
[01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:37.715]  The first is an Electoral Reform Act so that he recruits the 73% that did not vote for him.
[01:48:37.715 --> 01:48:49.145]  The second is a Trump channel so that he can bypass the media and work through people like you and Greg Hunter and other... Sure, he should just go on every day with press announcements himself or with others and just lay it out.
[01:48:49.858 --> 01:49:09.853]  Think about a 7-minute fireside chat from the President every day, and then think about all of his cabinet officials being brought in to do 7- to 15-minute YouTubes, and then think about Donald Trump asking America a question with a tweet, and using Polmole, P-O-L-L-M-O-L-E, Polmole.
[01:49:09.853 --> 01:49:11.994]  With Polmole, I can get 150 million answers.
[01:49:11.994 --> 01:49:12.475]  No, that's it.
[01:49:12.475 --> 01:49:18.119]  He must mobilize his base that's just sitting on the sideline, because they're mobilizing their armies right now.
[01:49:18.119 --> 01:49:18.940]  We must mobilize.
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:26.745]  Yes, but we need to mobilize the 70% that George Sotos doesn't control.
[01:49:26.745 --> 01:49:32.390]  This morning when I came in, I meant to get on air and say, become activist, call C-SPAN, get in the streets.
[01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:34.531]  What do people need to do to expose this?
[01:49:34.531 --> 01:49:38.074]  I mean, you're dead on about their plan.
[01:49:38.074 --> 01:49:44.159]  Alex, I certainly am a very humble person, and these have been eight very hard years wandering in the wilderness.
[01:49:44.159 --> 01:49:46.681]  My bottom line is Donald Trump needs to sit down and listen.
[01:49:48.323 --> 01:49:53.665]  I have had for a number of years, I've been trying to get a hold of him since July of 2015.
[01:49:53.665 --> 01:49:57.207]  And I wrote the first article, Counter Coop, How Donald Trump Can Win.
[01:49:57.207 --> 01:50:01.088]  It appeared in Counter Punch, which is an excellent magazine, in August of 2015.
[01:50:01.088 --> 01:50:04.149]  Corey Lebekowski blew me off.
[01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:05.450]  Roger Stone blew me off.
[01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:08.191]  I visited Paul Manafort's office five times.
[01:50:08.191 --> 01:50:09.051]  He blew me off.
[01:50:09.691 --> 01:50:10.451]  Okay.
[01:50:10.451 --> 01:50:12.292]  Donald Trump is isolated.
[01:50:12.292 --> 01:50:13.873]  His mail is being controlled.
[01:50:13.873 --> 01:50:18.935]  He's not getting to sit down with people like, I'll name five names.
[01:50:18.935 --> 01:50:23.876]  Robert Steele, Dennis Kucinich, Cynthia McKinney, Ralph Nader, and Jesse Ventura.
[01:50:23.876 --> 01:50:32.740]  You put those five people in an office with Donald Trump, you announce the Electoral Reform Act, and you have those five people and Donald Trump brainstorm the country.
[01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:33.160]  50 states in 30 days.
[01:50:36.241 --> 01:50:40.805]  I guarantee you we will own this country for the people.
[01:50:40.805 --> 01:50:43.808]  You're just saying with that type of diverse crowd it would be optics for the public.
[01:50:43.808 --> 01:50:45.510]  This was a big table for everybody.
[01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:47.392]  What Trump's doing... It's not just optics for the public.
[01:50:47.392 --> 01:50:50.615]  Donald Trump has to understand the Republican Party is toast.
[01:50:51.567 --> 01:50:57.474]  Well, the Republican Party is definitely at the top out to get Trump and block the American people along with the Democrats.
[01:50:57.474 --> 01:51:00.257]  So I see the Republicans, the Democrats, and the globalists as his main enemies.
[01:51:00.257 --> 01:51:02.359]  How will you spend your tax return?
[01:51:02.359 --> 01:51:06.364]  Will a new TV or the newest cell phone protect you when the unexpected happens?
[01:51:06.784 --> 01:51:10.369]  Wildfires, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes.
[01:51:10.369 --> 01:51:15.194]  You and your family could be left helpless waiting for a slow-acting FEMA to come to your rescue.
[01:51:15.194 --> 01:51:18.758]  In a disaster, local store shelves are emptied in just hours.

[01:52:59.441 --> 01:53:04.224]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:53:04.224 --> 01:53:10.106]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.

[01:54:04.674 --> 01:54:09.216]  And that's who Trump models himself after is Andrew Jackson.
[01:54:09.216 --> 01:54:10.217]  Listen.
[01:54:10.217 --> 01:54:12.618]  The guys are in there monitoring.
[01:54:12.618 --> 01:54:13.758]  The crews are in there monitoring.
[01:54:16.593 --> 01:54:24.679]  Trump's hour-long press conference, where he is just tearing into Hillary, being connected to the Russians and the uranium, and meeting with Putin secretly.
[01:54:24.679 --> 01:54:28.501]  He's finally doing what I have begged him to do, personally.
[01:54:28.501 --> 01:54:31.323]  And the media is always asking, what do you talk to Trump about?
[01:54:31.323 --> 01:54:32.824]  I go, well, I'll tell you this.
[01:54:32.824 --> 01:54:37.267]  I say, sir, please go after China, openly giving money to Hillary, Saudi Arabia and the Russians.
[01:54:37.907 --> 01:54:41.470]  And here's all the articles, sir, and he's sitting there, you know, writing them down while I'm talking to him.
[01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:42.791]  He goes, I know, I know.
[01:54:42.791 --> 01:54:46.173]  And he goes, and the OPM hack, well, you know, well, God, that was under Obama.
[01:54:46.173 --> 01:54:47.434]  You know, 15 million names.
[01:54:47.434 --> 01:54:48.334]  I'm like, I know, sir, I know.
[01:54:48.334 --> 01:54:48.615]  And he's like...
[01:54:49.631 --> 01:54:53.714]  So if you want to know what I thought about Trump, it's that I have personally begged him to do this.
[01:54:53.714 --> 01:54:57.857]  And so, I mean, I've said the common sense is just let the law be carried out.
[01:54:57.857 --> 01:55:03.222]  And of all these, you know, Republicans and Democrats, like he said during his inauguration, we're going to have everybody.
[01:55:03.222 --> 01:55:05.163]  They've all been on the Russian payroll.
[01:55:05.163 --> 01:55:06.064]  I'm not attacking the Russians.
[01:55:06.064 --> 01:55:07.785]  That's what governments do.
[01:55:07.785 --> 01:55:12.228]  Or the Chinese who brag they've done it and say they're going to censor the web, the communists.
[01:55:12.228 --> 01:55:13.609]  Then, then arrest them all.
[01:55:13.609 --> 01:55:16.432]  And I'm not looking for some purge here, but the law is the law.
[01:55:16.432 --> 01:55:19.134]  And I'm sick of reading the newspaper, my own hometown paper.
[01:55:20.188 --> 01:55:30.537]  Has had it three times the last two months in the front of the physical metro and state that I'm a quote Russian idiot or a Russian dupe or a Russian agent.
[01:55:30.537 --> 01:55:31.698]  Man, that's weird.
[01:55:31.698 --> 01:55:33.399]  Okay, that's crazy.
[01:55:33.399 --> 01:55:34.740]  I just like two Russian words.
[01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:38.283]  Okay, and that's the level we've reached here.
[01:55:38.283 --> 01:55:40.665]  And so we're gonna have excerpts of that coming up.
[01:55:40.665 --> 01:55:41.186]  He's still going.
[01:55:41.186 --> 01:55:42.347]  We're getting the best clips.
[01:55:42.347 --> 01:55:47.271]  We've got a New York Post reporter coming on where Obama and that's the Soros group are literally admitting
[01:55:47.751 --> 01:55:55.938]  They're moving to overthrow Trump, but it shows that in the councils that people like Evan McMillan of the CIA are in, they're confident enough.
[01:55:55.938 --> 01:56:03.484]  Let me tell you something, you start getting on air as a person that's powerful and saying, you know, the president is a, quote, domestic enemy and he needs to be overthrown.
[01:56:04.204 --> 01:56:07.668]  The president has, and the agencies that follow the Constitution have full purview.
[01:56:07.668 --> 01:56:09.150]  You're an outside enemy now.
[01:56:09.150 --> 01:56:15.377]  I mean, that is not a very good way to be staying around above the, you know, above the dirt level, above the grass.
[01:56:15.377 --> 01:56:16.418]  I'm not threatening this guy.
[01:56:16.418 --> 01:56:17.459]  I don't care about him.
[01:56:17.459 --> 01:56:21.884]  The point is, it's really super crazy to be saying this.
[01:56:21.884 --> 01:56:24.507]  What do you make of all this rhetoric, Robert David Field?
[01:56:25.489 --> 01:56:29.871]  Well, McMullin has just demonstrated that he's clickbait.
[01:56:29.871 --> 01:56:32.833]  He's right up there with Madonna.
[01:56:32.833 --> 01:56:34.794]  I think very, very poorly of him.
[01:56:34.794 --> 01:56:39.257]  He is being an irresponsible, unprofessional person.
[01:56:39.257 --> 01:56:44.279]  Donald Trump, for all of his flaws, is unshackled.
[01:56:44.279 --> 01:56:49.062]  And I cannot emphasize this anymore.
[01:56:49.062 --> 01:56:50.623]  There is one chance.
[01:56:51.411 --> 01:56:54.552]  To restore the Constitution and restore the Republic.
[01:56:54.552 --> 01:57:04.274]  Now, I'm really pleased that Jeff Sessions and James Comey, who appears to have turned around somewhat, they're going after the pedophiles among the elite.
[01:57:04.274 --> 01:57:08.094]  A number of arrests are expected in the next week or two.
[01:57:08.094 --> 01:57:09.475]  And that's putting them on notice.
[01:57:09.475 --> 01:57:10.915]  That's putting them on notice, isn't it?
[01:57:10.915 --> 01:57:12.675]  Yes, it is putting them on notice.
[01:57:12.675 --> 01:57:14.656]  These people are extremely vulnerable.
[01:57:14.656 --> 01:57:20.217]  However, one of the problems that I have with Trump's current team is they don't seem to understand
[01:57:21.291 --> 01:57:26.413]  That the real enemies, the existential enemies of America are right here at home.
[01:57:26.413 --> 01:57:28.114]  They are not overseas.
[01:57:28.114 --> 01:57:30.575]  North Korea is the Chinese's problem.
[01:57:30.575 --> 01:57:32.836]  Look, look, look, Trump's gotta be political some.
[01:57:32.836 --> 01:57:40.459]  I mean, you know, he's gotta have some, if he's gonna not start war with Russia and people, he's gotta have something, you know, that nationalistic he's gonna do.
[01:57:41.727 --> 01:57:45.528]  I'll tell you what, let's make America great again starting right here at home.
[01:57:45.528 --> 01:57:52.430]  What Donald Trump needs to do is restore integrity to our electoral process and our governance process.
[01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:54.111]  Nothing else matters.
[01:57:54.111 --> 01:57:58.792]  All of these platitudes about Russia and Iran and other countries.
[01:57:59.651 --> 01:58:01.532]  are platitudes.
[01:58:01.532 --> 01:58:11.216]  There is one tangible thing that Donald Trump can do other than firing Reince Priebus, which is he can call for an Electoral Reform Act.
[01:58:11.216 --> 01:58:18.339]  And before he does that, I think he should have a very public meeting with Cynthia McKinney, Dennis Cassini's partner.
[01:58:18.339 --> 01:58:19.300]  No, no, I agree.
[01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:21.081]  And I've seen that plan you have.
[01:58:21.081 --> 01:58:23.942]  All I'm telling you is, is that I want to come back in 70 seconds to talk more about
[01:58:24.802 --> 01:58:25.783]  474 arrests in L.A.
[01:58:25.783 --> 01:58:29.326]  of pedophiles and a bunch of kids actually kept in slave dungeons.
[01:58:29.326 --> 01:58:30.327]  That's not even on the news.
[01:58:30.327 --> 01:58:31.928]  That shows how it's a cover-up.
[01:58:31.928 --> 01:58:33.109]  Arrests all over the country.
[01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:35.231]  Arrest of Sandusky's son.
[01:58:35.231 --> 01:58:36.552]  We've got Weiner.
[01:58:36.552 --> 01:58:37.573]  Child porn stuff.
[01:58:37.573 --> 01:58:41.096]  I mean, our law enforcement people told us this three months ago.
[01:58:41.096 --> 01:58:43.498]  So, I mean, this is really going on.
[01:58:43.498 --> 01:58:45.560]  And you know who hit one of the pedophiles?
[01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:46.361]  It's Donald Trump.
[01:58:46.361 --> 01:58:47.842]  And Sessions didn't either.
[01:58:47.842 --> 01:58:48.543]  They want to go after him.
[01:58:50.157 --> 01:58:57.423]  Since a federal judge has halted Trump's executive order, 60% of the refugee arrivals to the United States have come from terror-prone countries.
[01:58:57.423 --> 01:58:59.184]  In fact, the most terror-prone.
[01:58:59.184 --> 01:58:59.704]  Since U.S.
[01:58:59.704 --> 01:59:10.573]  District Judge James Robart's restraining order, the United States has taken 532 refugees from Syria, a civil war-torn country ripe with terrorists, in which President Assad of Syria and U.S.
[01:59:10.573 --> 01:59:14.836]  intelligence agencies said are infiltrating refugee groups.
[01:59:14.836 --> 01:59:18.159]  472 refugees from Iraq, where Americans can't even go out on the streets,
[01:59:18.699 --> 01:59:24.266]  363 from Somalia, where we already had a refugee stab 11 people at Ohio State.
[01:59:24.266 --> 01:59:32.616]  117 refugees from Iran, where they just last week held a march, where they marched on the American flag and chanted death to the US in the streets.
[01:59:32.616 --> 01:59:36.321]  And 65 are from Sudan, a failed state, for a total of 1,549 refugees.
[01:59:38.203 --> 01:59:39.584]  Well, I try to align myself with the truth.
[02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:12.410]  Sometimes it's hard to find.
[02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:18.073]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:18.073 --> 02:00:20.834]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.834 --> 02:00:24.055]  Alright, actually involved in real covert action on the ground for many years in the CIA.
[02:00:24.055 --> 02:00:27.396]  Robert David Steele is a researcher, writer, author.
[02:00:27.396 --> 02:00:30.477]  You can find his website robertdavidsteele.com and more.
[02:00:30.477 --> 02:00:32.038]  Just Google his name.
[02:00:32.038 --> 02:00:35.579]  He's got a memorandum for the president that we're going to post at infowars.com.
[02:00:35.579 --> 02:00:36.900]  It's pretty powerful information.
[02:00:38.297 --> 02:00:41.180]  And I agree with almost all of it, other than these roundtable meetings.
[02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:42.681]  I think those are fine too.
[02:00:42.681 --> 02:00:47.185]  It's just that... I know this.
[02:00:47.185 --> 02:00:50.128]  The entire power structure is against Trump.
[02:00:50.128 --> 02:00:53.851]  The foreign banks, the Saudi Arabians, the communist Chinese, it's so obvious.
[02:00:53.851 --> 02:00:58.515]  And he's really trying to cut taxes on poor people, have the big banks loan to local businesses.
[02:00:58.515 --> 02:01:00.517]  I mean, it's a real move towards prosperity.
[02:01:00.517 --> 02:01:03.720]  He's not perfect, but he's just kind of a businessman that did not hit the country.
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:04.921]  Doesn't mean he's not going to make mistakes.
[02:01:05.942 --> 02:01:07.503]  Versus the elites.
[02:01:07.503 --> 02:01:10.085]  Are they trying to act, Robert, confident?
[02:01:10.085 --> 02:01:13.788]  Or are they really, in a megalomaniac way, confident that they're going to bring Trump down?
[02:01:13.788 --> 02:01:16.890]  Because Michael Moore is saying, we're going to overthrow him.
[02:01:16.890 --> 02:01:17.811]  He is a Russian.
[02:01:17.811 --> 02:01:19.632]  And then the CIA comes out.
[02:01:19.632 --> 02:01:20.573]  He is a Russian.
[02:01:20.573 --> 02:01:21.494]  We know the talking points.
[02:01:21.494 --> 02:01:22.754]  They've been building this up.
[02:01:22.754 --> 02:01:24.576]  Now they're in the news saying, could we kill him?
[02:01:24.576 --> 02:01:26.077]  Could the CIA legally kill him?
[02:01:26.077 --> 02:01:28.519]  They're really trying to get themselves up to that edge of that cliff.
[02:01:29.019 --> 02:01:31.624]  I don't think they realize what's going to come if they do that separately.
[02:01:31.624 --> 02:01:33.707]  This is in 1963.
[02:01:33.707 --> 02:01:37.293]  Separately, let's get into what your intel is on more roundups of pedophiles.
[02:01:38.493 --> 02:01:52.284]  Well, let me first say that Katherine Austin Fitz, speaking for Greg Hunter, the underground show, has a YouTube that I consider to be the single most important piece of advice Donald Trump could ever get.
[02:01:52.284 --> 02:01:54.426]  They are playing Trump like a fiddle.
[02:01:54.426 --> 02:01:57.868]  They're going after his women, which makes them crazy.
[02:01:57.868 --> 02:02:00.831]  They are undermining him with the media.
[02:02:00.831 --> 02:02:02.092]  Trump is not focusing.
[02:02:02.432 --> 02:02:08.014]  He made a huge mistake today in doubling down on a national security advisor.
[02:02:08.014 --> 02:02:12.475]  What he really needs is a national strategy advisor that can do whole of government thinking.
[02:02:12.475 --> 02:02:17.317]  Yeah, they're distracting him with filling his cabinet when what matters is he's everything.
[02:02:18.186 --> 02:02:20.128]  Yes, absolutely right.
[02:02:20.128 --> 02:02:22.491]  Alex, you are absolutely on target.
[02:02:22.491 --> 02:02:33.443]  Donald Trump needs to sit down and game out the next 90 days, and he has to do it in a way that allows him to shut down the two-party tyranny.
[02:02:33.443 --> 02:02:35.586]  Paul Ryan is not his friend.
[02:02:35.586 --> 02:02:37.007]  Oh, Paul Ryan is his sworn enemy.
[02:02:39.141 --> 02:02:53.756]  In fact, I gotta be honest, here's the thing, the Democrat leadership thinks that Russia invaded Korea and doesn't know what day it is, and thinks Bush is in office, but they're all goofy and just, it is like, what's curious, the Republican leadership has got their act together, but they're really the threat to Trump, I think.
[02:02:54.662 --> 02:03:05.189]  I agree with you completely, Alex, and one of the reasons I want to throw the press out of the White House and create a Trump channel in that space is because Fox News is part of the craft.
[02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:08.030]  Oh, they're attacking him backhanded every 10 seconds.
[02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:14.094]  They are sleazeballs, and frankly, I'm tired of three bimbos in the morning and five jerks at night.
[02:03:14.094 --> 02:03:17.837]  Fox News is a disgrace to the journalist profession.
[02:03:17.837 --> 02:03:23.040]  Trump needs to sit down and think strategically, and he doesn't have anyone that can do that for him.
[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:27.622]  I love Bannon, but Bannon needs playmates that are diversified.
[02:03:27.622 --> 02:03:28.462]  You know what they're doing.
[02:03:28.462 --> 02:03:29.763]  They're trying to run Bannon out.
[02:03:29.763 --> 02:03:31.304]  Bannon's just trying to get policy done.
[02:03:31.304 --> 02:03:32.925]  Yeah, but Bannon's been very good.
[02:03:32.925 --> 02:03:34.805]  But here's the bottom line, Alex.
[02:03:34.805 --> 02:03:41.889]  If Trump will listen, if Trump will read the memo for Trump, and if Trump will follow this strategy,
[02:03:42.748 --> 02:03:46.829]  He could shut down George Sotos within the next 15 days.
[02:03:46.829 --> 02:03:48.350]  Yeah, why is he scared to have this?
[02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:51.351]  I mean, clearly Soros has committed a bunch of crimes and stuff.
[02:03:51.351 --> 02:03:52.471]  Why not just indict him?
[02:03:52.471 --> 02:03:55.032]  Why not take the gloves off?
[02:03:55.032 --> 02:03:59.113]  Frankly, I'm surprised that George Sotos hasn't had a bullet put through his brain.
[02:03:59.113 --> 02:04:01.874]  We have something called ranger justice.
[02:04:01.874 --> 02:04:03.335]  It's when specific people
[02:04:04.716 --> 02:04:07.739]  Understand that certain things need to be done and they do it.
[02:04:07.739 --> 02:04:12.024]  George Sotos is a dead man walking, in my view.
[02:04:12.024 --> 02:04:25.577]  I certainly am no threat to George Sotos, but I think he is very, very likely to be assassinated in the next 180 days if he doesn't change his... All I know is people can't go on TV and call the President a domestic enemy and he's be overthrown and stuff doesn't happen.
[02:04:25.577 --> 02:04:26.318]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:04:28.307 --> 02:04:31.910]  Alex, we all need to rally behind Donald Trump.
[02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:36.032]  I just got off Gary Null, and I'm on with Gary Null again on Tuesday.
[02:04:57.847 --> 02:04:59.988]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:59.988 --> 02:05:05.051]  In a protest against Donald Trump's tight citizenship policy, a day without immigrants has been declared nationwide.
[02:05:05.051 --> 02:05:10.435]  Today, February 16, 2017, will go down in history as a day without immigrants.
[02:05:10.435 --> 02:05:11.155]  Look around you.
[02:05:11.155 --> 02:05:12.436]  Is that person an immigrant?
[02:05:12.436 --> 02:05:14.157]  Imagine if they were just gone.
[02:05:14.157 --> 02:05:15.017]  But wait a second.
[02:05:15.017 --> 02:05:17.159]  This ideal or illustration doesn't make sense.
[02:05:17.159 --> 02:05:18.960]  President Trump is not deporting immigrants.
[02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:22.462]  In fact, I'm yet to see or hear any policy that deals directly with just immigrants.
[02:05:22.682 --> 02:05:24.444]  So, are citizens of the U.S.
[02:05:24.444 --> 02:05:31.530]  that have immigrated here going to take off work in protest for those who want to skirt the legal process that they went through to be an immigrant?
[02:05:31.530 --> 02:05:32.651]  An interesting notion.
[02:05:32.651 --> 02:05:38.916]  Or will this just be a bunch of self-loathing white liberal college students and older women like usual in a desperate attempt to virtue signal against Trump?
[02:05:39.276 --> 02:05:43.521]  Or, will non-citizens show up and proudly announce that they work here illegally?
[02:05:43.521 --> 02:05:47.206]  The goal of this protest is to display how imperative immigrants are to society.
[02:05:47.206 --> 02:05:49.108]  Guess we will find that out real quick.
[02:05:49.108 --> 02:05:56.817]  Or, we will see that people who immigrated here came here to work for a better life and have better things to do than protest a process that they followed.
[02:05:56.817 --> 02:05:59.060]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.

[02:06:59.585 --> 02:07:02.928]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[02:07:02.928 --> 02:07:04.069]  They lost.
[02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.450]  We won.
[02:07:04.450 --> 02:07:10.736]  Wanna see what Trump's up against?
[02:07:10.736 --> 02:07:14.660]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[02:07:15.420 --> 02:07:21.247]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[02:07:21.247 --> 02:07:27.393]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[02:07:27.393 --> 02:07:33.700]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:36.163]  Revelation, dawn of global government.
[02:07:36.403 --> 02:07:37.584]  We're the solution!
[02:07:37.584 --> 02:07:38.504]  Americans!
[02:07:38.504 --> 02:07:40.105]  Ain't nothing more to it than that.
[02:07:40.105 --> 02:07:45.488]  Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin.
[02:07:45.488 --> 02:07:47.149]  Theatrical screenings on demand.
[02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:49.050]  DVDs now available.
[02:07:49.050 --> 02:07:52.491]  Wanna shed some tears over the red, white, and blue?
[02:07:52.491 --> 02:07:54.673]  Americans need to see this film.
[02:08:10.734 --> 02:08:16.118]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:08:16.118 --> 02:08:18.420]  This is it, boys!
[02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:20.302]  Toe-to-toe combat with the NWO!
[02:08:20.302 --> 02:08:31.391]  As everybody knows, we have a lot of sources in the government, outside the government.
[02:08:31.391 --> 02:08:34.093]  We track what George Soros is up to.
[02:08:34.093 --> 02:08:37.316]  But rarely do I read articles in the MSN that actually tell the truth.
[02:08:38.516 --> 02:08:50.633]  And actually get what's going on because I'm watching the left all over announce, we're gonna overthrow Trump, we're gonna burn down cities, we're gonna kill him, you know, just everywhere the last few weeks and then almost nothing in MSM until the last day or so.
[02:08:50.633 --> 02:08:51.375]  This article came out.
[02:08:53.317 --> 02:09:09.738]  Saturday, but it's really started to break now where they've got former CIA people saying that Trump's quote a domestic enemy overthrowing I mean, this is just unprecedented craziness Over a national security advisor, you know lining up phone calls to the president
[02:09:10.529 --> 02:09:14.173]  This is just unbelievable to see the whole power structure in revolt.
[02:09:14.173 --> 02:09:18.076]  And now, for like an hour and 15 minutes, Trump has been giving a press conference.
[02:09:18.076 --> 02:09:18.977]  We've got excerpts of it.
[02:09:18.977 --> 02:09:20.259]  He's still going!
[02:09:20.259 --> 02:09:23.462]  That Hillary's the Russian spy, and it's all going to be brought out.
[02:09:23.462 --> 02:09:27.746]  And I've begged Trump personally.
[02:09:27.746 --> 02:09:30.108]  And the media, when they ask me about Trump, they never print this.
[02:09:30.108 --> 02:09:30.889]  They don't want this out there.
[02:09:33.331 --> 02:09:34.151]  Oh, you know what Trump said?
[02:09:34.151 --> 02:09:35.232]  He said this.
[02:09:35.232 --> 02:09:41.294]  The Communist Chinese funding Hillary, the Saudi Arabians, they bragged in the newspapers they gave money.
[02:09:41.294 --> 02:09:43.354]  One-fifth of the money came from the Saudi Arabians.
[02:09:43.354 --> 02:09:44.295]  Totally illegal!
[02:09:44.295 --> 02:09:46.115]  Her foundation, all of it.
[02:09:46.115 --> 02:09:49.096]  The uranium, the $35 million for our uranium.
[02:09:49.096 --> 02:09:51.317]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:09:51.317 --> 02:09:53.377]  She met with Putin twice secretly.
[02:09:53.377 --> 02:09:56.498]  When she was Secretary of State.
[02:09:56.498 --> 02:09:58.719]  Quite frankly, under the purview of the President, she could do it.
[02:09:58.719 --> 02:10:00.960]  But now they're saying this President can't talk to the Russians?
[02:10:02.073 --> 02:10:07.375]  We're going to go to our guest in a moment, but here's just a minute or two of Trump from about, I don't know, 30 minutes ago.
[02:10:07.375 --> 02:10:08.235]  There's a lot more.
[02:10:08.235 --> 02:10:10.496]  I mean, I just saw part of it.
[02:10:10.496 --> 02:10:14.257]  This is Trump getting into Hillary and the fact that this is the key.
[02:10:14.257 --> 02:10:17.699]  They're trying to undermine the election so the American people didn't elect him.
[02:10:17.699 --> 02:10:26.482]  Trying to make him like a Russian agent when she's the one in bed with him and the Communist Chinese and the Saudis and the Vatican and everybody else, the Pope.
[02:10:27.122 --> 02:10:28.723]  The whole Catholic Church turning against him?
[02:10:28.723 --> 02:10:30.924]  I mean, they're the ones that are weak, folks.
[02:10:30.924 --> 02:10:31.524]  We're strong.
[02:10:31.524 --> 02:10:33.245]  And Trump is so real.
[02:10:33.245 --> 02:10:36.927]  To see a real president in there, calling the fake media out, it's amazing.
[02:10:36.927 --> 02:10:39.429]  We're on the New York Post reporter Paul Sperry.
[02:10:39.429 --> 02:10:40.870]  I appreciate coming on here just a minute.
[02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:46.493]  How Obama is scheming to sabotage the Trump presidency in a bunker two miles away with 30,000 activists.
[02:10:46.493 --> 02:10:49.835]  But first, here's a clip of the president.
[02:10:49.835 --> 02:10:53.997]  And if I don't, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton
[02:10:54.707 --> 02:10:57.849]  Would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.
[02:10:57.849 --> 02:11:00.271]  Does anybody in this room really believe that?
[02:11:00.271 --> 02:11:00.991]  Okay?
[02:11:00.991 --> 02:11:02.412]  But I'll tell you one thing.
[02:11:02.412 --> 02:11:03.593]  She tried to make a deal.
[02:11:03.593 --> 02:11:05.074]  She had the reset.
[02:11:05.074 --> 02:11:07.336]  She gave all that valuable uranium away.
[02:11:07.336 --> 02:11:08.457]  She did other things.
[02:11:08.457 --> 02:11:10.238]  You know, they say I'm close to Russia.
[02:11:10.238 --> 02:11:13.780]  Hillary Clinton gave away 20% of the uranium in the United States.
[02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:15.341]  She's close to Russia.
[02:11:15.341 --> 02:11:17.703]  You know what I gave to Russia?
[02:11:17.703 --> 02:11:18.564]  You know what I gave?
[02:11:18.564 --> 02:11:19.044]  Nothing.
[02:11:19.044 --> 02:11:21.766]  Can we conclude there'll be no response to these particular provocations?
[02:11:23.004 --> 02:11:25.486]  I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do.
[02:11:25.486 --> 02:11:27.107]  I don't talk about military response.
[02:11:27.107 --> 02:11:29.669]  I don't say I'm going into Mosul in four months.
[02:11:29.669 --> 02:11:32.451]  We are going to attack Mosul in four months.
[02:11:32.451 --> 02:11:36.234]  Then three months later, we are going to attack Mosul in one month.
[02:11:36.234 --> 02:11:38.876]  Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.
[02:11:38.876 --> 02:11:40.417]  Mosul is very, very difficult.
[02:11:40.417 --> 02:11:40.998]  Do you know why?
[02:11:40.998 --> 02:11:46.482]  Because I don't talk about military and I don't talk about certain other things.
[02:11:46.482 --> 02:11:48.123]  You're going to be surprised to hear that.
[02:11:48.123 --> 02:11:50.485]  And by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that.
[02:11:50.485 --> 02:11:51.466]  So I don't have to tell you.
[02:11:52.302 --> 02:11:56.364]  I don't want to be one of these guys that say, yes, here's what we're going to do.
[02:11:56.364 --> 02:11:58.145]  I don't have to do that.
[02:11:58.145 --> 02:12:00.206]  I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.
[02:12:00.206 --> 02:12:01.026]  Wait a minute.
[02:12:01.026 --> 02:12:05.128]  I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea.
[02:12:05.128 --> 02:12:09.931]  And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran.
[02:12:09.931 --> 02:12:10.691]  You know why?
[02:12:10.691 --> 02:12:11.972]  Because they shouldn't know.
[02:12:11.972 --> 02:12:16.154]  And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question.
[02:12:16.154 --> 02:12:18.355]  So when you ask me, what am I going to do with this ship?
[02:12:19.639 --> 02:12:21.400]  The Russian ship as an example?
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:22.700]  I'm not going to tell you.
[02:12:22.700 --> 02:12:24.381]  But hopefully I won't have to do anything.
[02:12:24.381 --> 02:12:25.622]  But I'm not going to tell you.
[02:12:25.622 --> 02:12:26.062]  Yeah.
[02:12:26.062 --> 02:12:26.402]  Thanks.
[02:12:26.402 --> 02:12:27.163]  That's good.
[02:12:27.163 --> 02:12:27.703]  He's unbelievable.
[02:12:27.703 --> 02:12:29.284]  I mean, I want this guest on.
[02:12:29.284 --> 02:12:30.424]  But back this up.
[02:12:30.424 --> 02:12:33.766]  I just want to start carrying Trump on the show because the media blocks what he really says.
[02:12:33.766 --> 02:12:35.427]  It takes out of context.
[02:12:35.427 --> 02:12:40.089]  I think we should create an alternate feed that when he's on, I just on the satellite
[02:12:41.266 --> 02:12:48.830]  If Trump won't start a White House Trump Network, we should just have live people in live time grab everything he does from WhiteHouse.gov and put it on a radio and TV satellite.
[02:12:48.830 --> 02:12:49.270]  That's it!
[02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.711]  I'm doing it.
[02:12:49.711 --> 02:12:51.051]  I already have the TV satellite.
[02:12:51.051 --> 02:12:51.812]  That's it!
[02:12:51.812 --> 02:12:52.452]  That's it!
[02:12:52.452 --> 02:12:53.173]  I'm launching it.
[02:12:53.173 --> 02:12:54.974]  I'm launching the Trump Network.
[02:12:54.974 --> 02:12:59.456]  You know, the American people coverage of the White House Network or coverage of the President Network.
[02:12:59.456 --> 02:12:59.796]  That's it!
[02:12:59.796 --> 02:13:00.257]  I'm announcing it.
[02:13:00.257 --> 02:13:00.957]  You just heard it.
[02:13:00.957 --> 02:13:02.258]  Let's go to Paul Sperry.
[02:13:02.258 --> 02:13:02.398]  Paul!
[02:13:03.238 --> 02:13:05.520]  Wow, what an incredible time to be alive.
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:25.635]  I've followed your work for a while, but it is just crazy how on target you are to show all these foreign multinationals pumping money into 501c3s, when Obama wouldn't even let Christians have 501c3s for eight years, and just planning the overthrow of the government and just all sorts of destabilization and craziness.
[02:13:25.635 --> 02:13:28.657]  You have really laid it out in this article.
[02:13:28.657 --> 02:13:29.457]  Let's break this down.
[02:13:29.457 --> 02:13:30.138]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:13:33.021 --> 02:13:36.283]  We have Paul Sperry?
[02:13:36.283 --> 02:13:37.544]  Afternoon, Alex.
[02:13:37.544 --> 02:13:38.424]  We've got you faded up now.
[02:13:38.424 --> 02:13:39.125]  Sorry, go ahead, sir.
[02:13:39.125 --> 02:13:40.786]  I mean, wow!
[02:13:40.786 --> 02:13:45.949]  Break down what's happening.
[02:13:45.949 --> 02:13:47.770]  We may have an audio problem to Paul.
[02:13:47.770 --> 02:13:48.691]  Well, that's alright.
[02:13:48.691 --> 02:13:51.072]  That happens sometimes.
[02:13:51.072 --> 02:13:52.093]  I'm picking you up.
[02:13:52.093 --> 02:13:52.953]  I'm picking you up.
[02:13:52.953 --> 02:13:54.414]  Yeah, can you hear me now, Paul?
[02:13:54.414 --> 02:13:55.215]  Yeah, I can hear you.
[02:13:55.215 --> 02:13:55.855]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:13:55.855 --> 02:13:56.876]  So, wow!
[02:13:56.876 --> 02:14:01.819]  Break down this article and what you've learned since you published it in the New York Post on Saturday.
[02:14:03.396 --> 02:14:09.882]  Yeah, I mean, Obama is the mastermind behind all these protests and the sabotaging of Trump.
[02:14:09.882 --> 02:14:16.367]  You know, Trump's hitting Hillary today in this press conference when he should be calling out Obama.
[02:14:16.367 --> 02:14:22.633]  I mean, this organizing for action is what I look at in this piece in the New York Post.
[02:14:22.633 --> 02:14:29.339]  It's listed on Obama's new post-presidency website, one of only two organizations listed.
[02:14:30.537 --> 02:14:32.178]  The other being the Obama Foundation.
[02:14:32.178 --> 02:14:41.562]  In fact, he's going to merge the two organizations into this very well-funded organizing and protesting superstructure.
[02:14:41.562 --> 02:14:45.464]  He's bitter at the election results.
[02:14:45.464 --> 02:14:47.265]  He's desperate to salvage his legacy.
[02:14:47.265 --> 02:14:52.387]  That goes for everything from Obamacare to the Iran deal.
[02:14:55.294 --> 02:15:00.918]  He wants to continue to advance the leftist agenda that voters repudiated at the polls.
[02:15:00.918 --> 02:15:05.000]  So what he's setting up here is a shadow opposition government.
[02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.663]  And it's already wreaking havoc on the new Republican administration.
[02:15:09.663 --> 02:15:15.287]  And it's a very popular America First agenda.
[02:15:15.287 --> 02:15:22.892]  And there's remnants of Obama's administration still deeply entrenched inside the Trump government.
[02:15:23.735 --> 02:15:26.039]  Or they're sabotaging him from the inside.
[02:15:26.039 --> 02:15:32.868]  Meanwhile, Obama's building this shadow government that I talk about in this column from the outside to sabotage Trump and his agenda.
[02:15:32.868 --> 02:15:40.019]  So he's got Obama saboteurs working on the inside against Trump and Obama saboteurs working against Trump on the inside.
[02:15:41.887 --> 02:15:44.808]  And in your article, you link to all their own groups, their own statements.
[02:15:44.808 --> 02:15:50.409]  It's like it's not even hidden that they say we're going to sabotage the agenda, we're going to try to throw him out of office.
[02:15:50.409 --> 02:15:55.731]  Michael Moore is saying he is a Russian, not just he's a Russian agent with no proof, and that we're going to overthrow him.
[02:15:55.731 --> 02:16:01.453]  And they've got former CIA people running around like Evan McMullin saying he's a domestic enemy.
[02:16:01.453 --> 02:16:04.373]  I mean, this is like Twilight Zone.
[02:16:04.373 --> 02:16:09.955]  Yeah, I mean, I'm a little worried if Trump doesn't, and Republicans, because they're getting hit too at these
[02:16:11.377 --> 02:16:19.723]  Uh, town hall meetings that are really going to get hit even harder next week during the recess by these groups, by Obama's group, OFA primarily.
[02:16:19.723 --> 02:16:26.849]  But I'm a little worried if Trump doesn't get out in front of this and call it for what it is, actually directly call Obama out.
[02:16:26.849 --> 02:16:28.530]  Forget about Hillary.
[02:16:28.530 --> 02:16:30.792]  His, Hillary's gone.
[02:16:30.792 --> 02:16:32.933]  His main concern right now is Obama.
[02:16:32.933 --> 02:16:36.296]  I mean, the guy set up a bunker just down the street from the White House.
[02:16:37.998 --> 02:16:55.970]  He's got a mansion, he's got offices, OFA, the Obama Foundation offices he's setting up in there, he's got his own chief of staff, press secretary, he's got a shadow White House just within two miles of Trump, where he can just launch fire salvo after salvo against Trump just down the street.
[02:16:58.323 --> 02:17:08.092]  I'm a little concerned that if Trump doesn't get out in front of this and call it for what it is, Obama could spark something on the order of a civil war here.
[02:17:08.092 --> 02:17:25.628]  He's really gearing up here over the next year or two to create a huge, very well-funded organizing and protesting infrastructure that's going to go after and constantly attack
[02:17:26.854 --> 02:17:29.982]  Trump and Republicans in this new administration.
[02:17:29.982 --> 02:17:32.068]  Paul Sperry, Twitter at Paul Sperry.
[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:34.600]  Absolutely.
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:40.244]  I mean, looking at this, studying history, I've not seen anything like this in modern U.S.
[02:17:40.244 --> 02:17:40.684]  history.
[02:17:40.684 --> 02:17:57.854]  I mean, maybe the Civil War, like you said, has parallels or some parallels, but this is a civil war by elements of the government and bureaucracies and foreign foundations against the president, who is so clearly a populist, so clearly Americana, going up in the polls.
[02:17:57.854 --> 02:17:59.155]  And I agree with you at a gut level.
[02:17:59.955 --> 02:18:03.637]  I am more concerned about this than anything I've ever seen in 20 years on air.
[02:18:03.637 --> 02:18:04.598]  They mean business.
[02:18:04.598 --> 02:18:16.284]  And I don't disagree they want to build this up over the next few years, but it appears they're making moves right now to try to topple the president.
[02:18:16.284 --> 02:18:18.965]  Yeah, Trump and Republicans don't know what they're up against.
[02:18:18.965 --> 02:18:20.386]  I mean, there's no precedent for this.
[02:18:20.386 --> 02:18:24.668]  No other president has stayed behind in Washington, at least not in 100 years.
[02:18:24.668 --> 02:18:26.069]  No one since Woodrow Wilson.
[02:18:26.069 --> 02:18:29.171]  And what's scarier is you're the only person pointing it out.
[02:18:30.478 --> 02:18:34.820]  Well, finally, people are starting to call this for what it is, all these protests.
[02:18:34.820 --> 02:18:42.963]  This is a shadow government set up by Obama that's behind it, but it needs to get in the mainstream media, which, of course, the media is behind the protests.
[02:18:42.963 --> 02:18:54.408]  So every time they get a video feed from one of these marches or protests, they play it over and over and make it seem like this is some big grassroots revolt against Trump.
[02:18:54.408 --> 02:18:55.208]  Of course, it's not.
[02:18:55.208 --> 02:18:58.889]  It's just artificially manufactured astroturf.
[02:18:58.889 --> 02:19:00.170]  But no other
[02:19:01.219 --> 02:19:05.162]  Former president has actively undermined a sitting president.
[02:19:05.162 --> 02:19:11.307]  Obama actually came out and did that with the immigration ban of the terror-prone Mosul.
[02:19:11.307 --> 02:19:13.209]  He also encouraged all these demonstrations.
[02:19:13.209 --> 02:19:15.831]  He says, what, you have an article heartening?
[02:19:15.831 --> 02:19:17.032]  Oh, not just that.
[02:19:17.032 --> 02:19:20.835]  I've got transcripts and that story, him talking about
[02:19:21.716 --> 02:19:33.125]  You know, he's basically rallying the OFA troops and saying, go out there and protest Trump, and I'm going to join you in a big way once I get back from vacation this year.
[02:19:33.125 --> 02:19:35.047]  And that's what he's planning on doing.
[02:19:35.047 --> 02:19:40.812]  And no other president has set up this kind of permanent protesting machine against another president.
[02:19:40.812 --> 02:19:46.917]  I mean, this isn't... We're going to see over the next year or two
[02:19:48.058 --> 02:20:03.565]  People are going to see it for what it is, because once he gets everything in place, Obama, I'm talking about with his Chicago presidential center, his foundation, and OFA is going to be a part of that, plus he's going to be in Washington with his own compound there just two miles from Trump.
[02:20:03.565 --> 02:20:14.710]  Once he gets everything in place, this thing is... We're going to basically have parallel governments competing against each other.
[02:20:14.710 --> 02:20:15.471]  We've never had that.
[02:20:16.803 --> 02:20:29.052]  That's right, so it's like a split civil war with the bureaucracies and the agencies and the branches all battling and the Republican establishment backstabbing Trump all because he wants to cut taxes on poor people and secure the border.
[02:20:29.052 --> 02:20:30.253]  I know you're the author of Infiltration.
[02:20:30.253 --> 02:20:37.659]  I'd love to have you back on to talk about your C-SPAN appearances in your book that I know has woken up so many people, but the time we have left here
[02:20:38.718 --> 02:20:57.190]  Expanding, expanding on just the larger aims, and I totally agree with you, that Obama's the big threat, that Trump's trying to be classy and say nothing about it, but Obama is out there undercutting him everywhere, out there criticizing him, and then out there trying to organize his overthrow.
[02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.991]  It's just crazy.
[02:20:58.641 --> 02:21:06.029]  Former presidents usually go out, it's the, you know, you have respect and courtesy even for an opposition party president.
[02:21:06.029 --> 02:21:09.912]  You go off into the sunset and you go fishing.
[02:21:09.912 --> 02:21:17.340]  And we've got a president here who's going back to doing what he does best, which is organizing and agitating and dividing.
[02:21:18.443 --> 02:21:19.623]  And that's what he's going to do.
[02:21:19.623 --> 02:21:22.904]  He's only 55 years old, relatively young for an ex-president, right?
[02:21:22.904 --> 02:21:25.064]  So we're talking about him.
[02:21:25.064 --> 02:21:28.805]  This guy is going to dig in for a long fight.
[02:21:28.805 --> 02:21:33.986]  He's going to be attacking Republicans, not just for years, but for decades.
[02:21:33.986 --> 02:21:35.886]  And his image is terrible.
[02:21:35.886 --> 02:21:42.327]  I'm not so much worried about him, but as you said, as a lightning rod, as a way to organize the media and what's behind him.
[02:21:42.327 --> 02:21:46.908]  He's a figurehead, but it's this big phalanx, you know, that he basically is marching at the head of.
[02:21:47.848 --> 02:21:49.589]  And it just really shows a total commitment.
[02:21:49.589 --> 02:22:03.438]  When George Soros, the week after they won last year in November, doubled the amount of money he'd given the last year to all these communists and Black Lives Matter, you know, cop killer groups, that really signified, oh my God, they're not going to back down.
[02:22:03.438 --> 02:22:04.659]  They're going to accelerate.
[02:22:04.659 --> 02:22:11.903]  And now there's a wild-eyedness to them that, quite frankly, is unprecedented.
[02:22:11.903 --> 02:22:14.324]  Well, you know, it's funny you say that about them.
[02:22:14.324 --> 02:22:16.586]  Speaking of Soros and some of these big donors,
[02:22:18.311 --> 02:22:31.497]  Obama took OFA, this is Organizing for Action, it was formerly Obama for America, he took it out of his 2012 campaign, turned it into a 501c4 so you can't see who's donating to this group.
[02:22:33.264 --> 02:22:39.010]  I know they've gotten huge blocks of $50,000 all the way up to half a million dollars.
[02:22:39.010 --> 02:22:41.994]  Oh, you know it's the Saudis, you know it's the Chinese.
[02:22:41.994 --> 02:22:43.836]  Soros as well.
[02:22:43.836 --> 02:22:51.645]  We don't know who's giving this money, but boy, when he gets all that up and running, you're going to have, linking it with his foundation, hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:22:52.245 --> 02:22:54.226]  This is going to be a huge issue.
[02:23:22.094 --> 02:23:24.560]  But at the same time, obviously a very dangerous climate.
[02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:28.610]  I'm just really thinking as a father, as a citizen, as somebody that loves this country and the world...
[02:23:29.639 --> 02:23:46.347]  With such a clearly good president who's doing what he said he would do, it's like it's a responsibility that I'm going to have to not just be on the air, but we're going to have to organize running for office, getting involved on the street, organizing the listeners to call C-SPAN and other shows.
[02:23:46.347 --> 02:23:47.808]  I mean, what else do we do?
[02:23:47.808 --> 02:23:53.671]  I guess go to these town halls, let folks know we're aware of what's... I think what you're saying is the battle has just begun.
[02:23:54.696 --> 02:24:02.359]  Yes, definitely go to your local Reps, Senators, Town Halls, and call out these people for who they are.
[02:24:02.359 --> 02:24:04.680]  They're OFA, they're Obama.
[02:24:04.680 --> 02:24:06.561]  They're not representative.
[02:24:06.561 --> 02:24:07.081]  That's key!
[02:24:07.081 --> 02:24:11.182]  The media will lie and not tell you that the main push is Obama.
[02:24:11.182 --> 02:24:17.325]  Right, but the problem is most traditional Americans are nice people and they do not riot or fight in the streets.
[02:24:17.958 --> 02:24:22.819]  They're too damn busy working and holding a job to march in the streets while the other side has nothing better to do.
[02:24:22.819 --> 02:24:28.621]  You know, these radical leftist protesters for these Olinskyites for Obama.
[02:24:28.621 --> 02:24:34.822]  And that's a problem, and the leftists get all the publicity on TV because the media is on their side.
[02:24:34.822 --> 02:24:41.664]  You know, they go to these town hall meetings, they secretly record them, and then they feed it to the media.
[02:24:41.664 --> 02:24:45.545]  CNN, MSNBC, they run it in a continuous loop and make it seem like
[02:24:46.566 --> 02:24:51.070]  Uh, this is some big, uh, sudden revolt against Trump.
[02:24:51.070 --> 02:24:52.691]  It's a classic program.
[02:24:52.691 --> 02:25:06.122]  Later, after everybody voted for the, in this landslide for his agenda and his policies, all of a sudden, well, what it does is it starts seeding doubt into people's mind who even voted for Trump and, well, boy, maybe, maybe people want to keep Obamacare.
[02:25:06.122 --> 02:25:08.483]  Maybe we don't want to secure the border.
[02:25:08.483 --> 02:25:09.364]  Uh, boy.
[02:25:09.364 --> 02:25:10.825]  So it also, uh,
[02:25:13.467 --> 02:25:21.314]  Maybe we shouldn't go back after this.
[02:25:21.314 --> 02:25:25.457]  I've met with my constituents that go back and vote for this Trump legislation.
[02:25:25.457 --> 02:25:27.139]  Maybe I should reconsider this.
[02:25:27.139 --> 02:25:29.141]  Maybe the people are against this.
[02:25:29.141 --> 02:25:35.486]  That's what Olinsky, through rules for rats, trained them to do.
[02:25:35.486 --> 02:25:38.869]  And by the way, I looked up these IRS 990s for this group, OFA.
[02:25:40.344 --> 02:25:55.914]  They're deploying an army of over 32,000 well-trained Alinsky agitators, and they've got another 25,000 that are being trained to bully Republicans and into backing off border security and Obamacare right now as we speak.
[02:25:55.914 --> 02:26:01.937]  But these aren't the typical Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street rabble.
[02:26:01.937 --> 02:26:04.399]  These are professionally trained agitators.
[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:07.841]  So now we're seeing him go back to his former profession?
[02:26:19.986 --> 02:26:22.509]  He wasn't even really good at governing.
[02:26:22.509 --> 02:26:26.813]  That's why he stirred the country up racially and divided it more than since the Civil War.
[02:26:26.813 --> 02:26:32.398]  He's a divider, and that's the end game for Lewinsky.
[02:26:32.398 --> 02:26:40.146]  Create chaos, civil war, and that will lay the groundwork, soften the ground for a revolution.
[02:26:40.146 --> 02:26:42.528]  Cultural takeover, exactly, and that's what he says.
[02:26:42.528 --> 02:26:44.370]  That's what he talked about, a revolution.
[02:26:45.811 --> 02:26:47.232]  Let's not forget who can make this up.
[02:26:47.232 --> 02:26:50.313]  He traded the feet of the literal weather underground.
[02:26:50.313 --> 02:26:51.894]  I mean, you cannot make that up.
[02:26:51.894 --> 02:26:54.575]  It's just so insane that this guy could ever become president.
[02:26:54.575 --> 02:26:58.997]  And then meanwhile, if you get back to all the rhetoric of the media, Trump is literally the unifier.
[02:26:58.997 --> 02:27:02.518]  If you hear his speeches, he's totally the opposite.
[02:27:02.518 --> 02:27:02.878]  I know.
[02:27:02.878 --> 02:27:10.061]  He's actually the guy, I call him the blue collar billionaire.
[02:27:10.061 --> 02:27:14.103]  I mean, it's oxymoronic, but he's more closer to the people.
[02:27:15.121 --> 02:27:28.772]  He's a true populist, but the problem with Obama is he fools so many people, including independents, into thinking that he's reasonable, because he sounds so reasonable.
[02:27:28.772 --> 02:27:33.956]  And he doesn't dress radically, he doesn't talk radically, but that guy's radical.
[02:27:33.956 --> 02:27:34.677]  Trust me on that.
[02:27:36.024 --> 02:27:41.029]  Well, I mean, he's got a chip on his shoulder, and that's what it's all about, and it's classic divide and conquer.
[02:27:41.029 --> 02:27:43.471]  It is crazy, and it's dangerous.
[02:27:43.471 --> 02:27:44.553]  Well, I just want to say this.
[02:27:44.553 --> 02:27:45.353]  I've read your articles.
[02:27:45.353 --> 02:27:51.740]  I've never interviewed you, and I've seen you on C-SPAN, but I'm impressed with your writing and the work you're doing, and Paul, I know you're a busy guy, but stay in touch with our producer.
[02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:56.605]  Anytime you've got something big you want to get an extra push on, or anytime you want to come on via Skype when you're not at work,
[02:27:57.509 --> 02:27:58.049]  Great job.
[02:27:58.049 --> 02:28:00.631]  I tell you, the New York Post is one of the only good papers out there.
[02:28:00.631 --> 02:28:04.153]  What would we do without the New York Post, without Drudge, without a few other publications?
[02:28:04.153 --> 02:28:05.134]  I mean, none of us are perfect.
[02:28:05.134 --> 02:28:07.995]  We're just not out for civil war.
[02:28:07.995 --> 02:28:11.698]  So just in closing, in the minute we have left, what else is on your radar?
[02:28:11.698 --> 02:28:12.858]  What else can the listeners do?
[02:28:12.858 --> 02:28:16.681]  Because I think people should just realize, we're in dire straits.
[02:28:16.681 --> 02:28:24.966]  The fact that Trump got in was because we were already in so much trouble, but now they're really showing us how nasty they are, only affirming our worst suspicions.
[02:28:26.536 --> 02:28:35.298]  Well, you've got to call in and email in your local reps to counteract this OFA.
[02:28:35.298 --> 02:28:45.240]  They're flooding the switchboards and inboxes of the reps, and that will help cement their spines.
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:55.422]  Because you've got to offset and counteract what the activists are doing against Trump and in support to protect Obama's legacy programs.
[02:28:56.249 --> 02:29:01.171]  This is really a crisis that's developing.
[02:29:01.171 --> 02:29:06.032]  And because Obama's not just subverting the new sitting government, he's subverting the will of the people.
[02:29:06.032 --> 02:29:10.454]  62 million Americans who voted for Trump and against the Obama agenda.
[02:29:12.222 --> 02:29:16.483]  It's a fight, and you know, Paul, we've come this far, but now we've got to keep it, we've got to deploy it.
[02:29:16.483 --> 02:29:28.265]  They're desperate because they know Bannon and Trump's plan is to turn on the engine of liberty, produce incredible wealth, empower people, and they know that their collectivism, getting people dependent, it's about to end, so they're fighting for their lives.
[02:29:28.265 --> 02:29:30.285]  But why don't they just give up and be prosperous?
[02:29:30.285 --> 02:29:32.746]  They're fighting for a lie!
[02:29:32.746 --> 02:29:36.786]  Right, you know, that's what they would do, but no.
[02:29:36.786 --> 02:29:38.147]  Alright, Paul, thank you so much.
[02:29:38.147 --> 02:29:39.247]  Great job at the New York Post.
[02:29:39.247 --> 02:29:40.047]  Thank you, we'll talk soon.
[02:29:41.738 --> 02:29:42.779]  That was a powerful interview.
[02:29:42.779 --> 02:29:44.161]  That's a great reporter.
[02:29:44.161 --> 02:29:46.745]  We're gonna come back and play some of these clips of Trump, man, I tell ya.
[02:29:46.745 --> 02:29:49.428]  We're lucky to have a president like this.

[02:33:12.099 --> 02:33:29.018]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[02:33:29.018 --> 02:33:31.101]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:38.746 --> 02:33:43.696]  We got a bunch of clips of the President in his hour and a half long epic press conference.
[02:33:43.696 --> 02:33:45.098]  We're starting to fight back, thank God.
[02:33:49.278 --> 02:34:03.086]  I want to talk about the victory we're having here because all over the world, again I can't stress this enough, nationalists, whether they be conservative, whatever, liberal, it doesn't matter, they're saying we're going to run our own country and we're not going to have these one-sided trade deals or these screw jobs anymore.
[02:34:03.086 --> 02:34:08.369]  And of course all the money's been going out of the West to multinational corporations to come back and buy up the West.
[02:34:08.369 --> 02:34:11.230]  It isn't even helping the third world.
[02:34:11.230 --> 02:34:12.071]  And that's globalism!
[02:34:13.154 --> 02:34:14.894]  And I cannot stress to you how evil they are.
[02:34:14.894 --> 02:34:16.455]  They want to break our families up.
[02:34:16.455 --> 02:34:17.875]  They want to forcibly inoculate us.
[02:34:17.875 --> 02:34:19.396]  They want to control our lives.
[02:34:19.396 --> 02:34:23.777]  Chelsea Clinton was going to run some global initiative for a mother, a global government of health care.
[02:34:23.777 --> 02:34:25.077]  That's her own book.
[02:34:25.077 --> 02:34:26.057]  I have it right here.
[02:34:26.057 --> 02:34:29.978]  Showed it to you yesterday and last week.
[02:34:29.978 --> 02:34:33.059]  They're so evil that I was walking around during the break just going,
[02:34:36.238 --> 02:34:46.125]  I mean, it's just, and they're all like stupid, evil, ugly people, but they rule us because we won't take action against them.
[02:34:46.125 --> 02:34:46.706]  Well, guess what?
[02:34:46.706 --> 02:34:48.888]  We're taking action now.
[02:34:48.888 --> 02:34:59.315]  And they know we have a conscience, so they'll look at stuff we don't do perfect, or mistakes that go on, or what some sub-person Trump does that's wrong, instead of the whole enemy globalist program is against him.
[02:34:59.315 --> 02:35:01.857]  He's desperately trying to get money to the middle class and poor people.
[02:35:01.857 --> 02:35:03.719]  He's doing everything right on that front.
[02:35:03.719 --> 02:35:04.679]  NAFTA, GATT, TPP.
[02:35:06.533 --> 02:35:08.174]  Killing the Obamacare mandate, $5,000.
[02:35:08.174 --> 02:35:11.275]  He signed one executive order and they said, oh, that doesn't do it.
[02:35:11.275 --> 02:35:12.856]  He signed another one last week.
[02:35:12.856 --> 02:35:15.177]  Almost no media coverage of him killing that.
[02:35:15.177 --> 02:35:21.641]  I have people asking me on the street yesterday and this morning, Alex, when's Trump going to get rid of that fine?
[02:35:21.641 --> 02:35:26.723]  I don't want to have to get insurance or I've already got some through such and such, but it's not covered under their rules.
[02:35:26.723 --> 02:35:28.984]  And I said, he's already dead.
[02:35:28.984 --> 02:35:29.985]  But see, the media won't tell him.
[02:35:31.155 --> 02:35:32.916]  They won't tell you the accomplishments.
[02:35:32.916 --> 02:35:34.356]  There are so many accomplishments.
[02:35:34.356 --> 02:35:35.517]  I just can't.
[02:35:35.517 --> 02:35:40.439]  I have sat down for hours at home, online, trying to chronicle them all, and I can't.
[02:35:40.439 --> 02:35:43.200]  Even breaking the back of the political correctness.
[02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:48.342]  Showing the media as a bunch of liars.
[02:35:48.342 --> 02:35:50.263]  Just, just, I mean, you name it.
[02:35:50.263 --> 02:35:51.063]  It makes my head spin.
[02:35:53.353 --> 02:35:57.214]  But let's talk about Le Pen, because I played one clip earlier, but I'm going to play these now.
[02:35:57.214 --> 02:35:59.035]  She's way ahead in the polls.
[02:35:59.035 --> 02:36:06.657]  And when you go to the analytics and the big IT AI systems, they say she's 10, 15 points ahead.
[02:36:06.657 --> 02:36:08.677]  So now they're in France talking about arresting her.
[02:36:08.677 --> 02:36:10.078]  Why she criticized Muslims.
[02:36:10.078 --> 02:36:11.578]  Since when couldn't you criticize Muslims?
[02:36:11.578 --> 02:36:12.978]  My Lord.
[02:36:12.978 --> 02:36:14.159]  People go, oh, what do you just hate Muslims?
[02:36:14.159 --> 02:36:15.659]  No, I was against the war in Iraq.
[02:36:15.659 --> 02:36:16.899]  The ultimate was to destabilize the whole region.
[02:36:16.899 --> 02:36:19.120]  It's part of a larger globalist plan.
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:22.701]  But what are they going to do with nationalists sweeping everywhere?
[02:36:25.211 --> 02:36:33.814]  They've already indicted her, actually, for inciting racial hatred, saying that they face the greatest threat they face is Nazi Germany.
[02:36:33.814 --> 02:36:39.155]  Well, I mean, large parts of France are on fire, including downtown Paris, as we speak.
[02:36:39.155 --> 02:36:43.977]  Tonight's even worse, like the eighth night of rioting, and it's like a bunch of lawless,
[02:36:45.470 --> 02:36:56.777]  Educated, unemployable people, in the collapsing French economy, running around bitching that they're not in the Middle East, North Africa, or wherever, then go back to your hellhole where women are sold on slave blocks!
[02:36:56.777 --> 02:37:04.622]  And a lot of the media goes, Jones claims Muslims still sell slaves, and he claims people will gang-rape a woman if J-Lo went to Somalia.
[02:37:04.622 --> 02:37:14.868]  Ladies and gentlemen, I know some of the top investigative journalists in the country who have been offered hundreds of thousands of dollars to go in with their faces covered
[02:37:16.593 --> 02:37:21.256]  In the military will not go into Somalia alone it is literal pirate ship
[02:37:35.811 --> 02:37:40.075]  They want people unfettered, unchecked from Somalia.
[02:37:40.075 --> 02:37:46.922]  Ladies and gentlemen, it has thousands of robbed boats lining up on its shores.
[02:37:46.922 --> 02:37:52.487]  Women are seen as animals in Somalia by their own sons.
[02:37:52.487 --> 02:37:56.411]  They have a few babies, they starve to death and just fall over dead.
[02:37:56.411 --> 02:37:59.313]  I'm not kidding.
[02:37:59.313 --> 02:38:00.815]  And of course it's a feminist god.
[02:38:06.518 --> 02:38:10.340]  I just can't handle it anymore, actually.
[02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:12.762]  But just because the left wants to commit suicide, we can't do it.
[02:38:12.762 --> 02:38:16.344]  And the Republican establishment, David Steele, Robert David Steele's actually right.
[02:38:16.344 --> 02:38:17.304]  They are just as bad.
[02:38:17.304 --> 02:38:19.125]  They think they're worse.
[02:38:19.125 --> 02:38:20.466]  Paul Ryan knows what he's doing.
[02:38:20.466 --> 02:38:22.347]  Nancy Pelosi doesn't know what planet she's on.
[02:38:22.347 --> 02:38:25.308]  Neither does Maxine Waters.
[02:38:25.308 --> 02:38:30.811]  Putin gave them the idea to drain the swamp, and she's crooked, and they attack Korea, too.
[02:38:32.617 --> 02:38:35.239]  Pelosi's like, yes, and George W. Bush is a bad president.
[02:38:35.239 --> 02:38:37.021]  We need to get him out of office.
[02:38:37.021 --> 02:38:38.022]  And no one corrects him?
[02:38:38.022 --> 02:38:40.284]  They just keep going on saying it like five times?
[02:38:40.284 --> 02:38:43.567]  I mean, whacked out loons!
[02:38:43.567 --> 02:38:48.191]  But you know Pelosi and Waters aren't going into basements with little kids chained up.
[02:38:48.191 --> 02:38:54.637]  I mean, you know that, right?
[02:38:54.637 --> 02:38:57.099]  God Almighty.
[02:38:57.099 --> 02:38:58.060]  That's all I can tell you.
[02:39:01.192 --> 02:39:02.513]  I know that there's some fake churches out there.
[02:39:02.513 --> 02:39:03.914]  That's the Lord's name in vain.
[02:39:03.914 --> 02:39:04.994]  You're not fighting the pedophiles.
[02:39:04.994 --> 02:39:06.495]  It's not the Lord's name in vain.
[02:39:06.495 --> 02:39:08.216]  I'm saying God Almighty crying out to God.
[02:39:08.216 --> 02:39:16.441]  You just want to sit around saying I'm evil all day because you don't know anything to fight evil.
[02:39:16.441 --> 02:39:17.222]  It's the paradox.
[02:39:17.222 --> 02:39:19.563]  Liberty gave us so much freedom and so much wealth.
[02:39:19.563 --> 02:39:21.144]  We've become decadent slobs.
[02:39:21.144 --> 02:39:28.029]  We've got some of these Trump clips coming up and we're going to have more of them excised out by the time that Anthony Cumia comes on if he wants to play some of them.
[02:39:28.029 --> 02:39:29.710]  Does a great job hosting the 4th Hour every few weeks.
[02:39:32.895 --> 02:39:34.836]  Let's go to Le Pen.
[02:39:34.836 --> 02:39:37.498]  Says the euro is a weapon used against EU nation states.
[02:39:37.498 --> 02:39:38.559]  Here it is.
[02:39:38.559 --> 02:39:41.901]  Investors in the financial markets are nervous about you.
[02:39:41.901 --> 02:39:45.163]  Because you want to return France... I'm sorry, start it over again.
[02:39:46.607 --> 02:39:47.928]  Again, terrorism.
[02:39:47.928 --> 02:39:49.148]  Trump's going to crash the markets!
[02:39:49.148 --> 02:39:50.689]  Alex Jones is going to crash the markets!
[02:39:50.689 --> 02:39:51.390]  It's horrible!
[02:39:51.390 --> 02:39:52.730]  Cutting taxes to crash the markets!
[02:39:52.730 --> 02:39:54.091]  Getting rid of Obamacare!
[02:39:54.091 --> 02:39:54.932]  Crash the markets!
[02:39:54.932 --> 02:39:55.712]  You're going to cause it!
[02:39:55.712 --> 02:40:01.655]  Because they're getting ready to crash them, just like they told the UK, if you do this, we're going to crash your markets.
[02:40:01.655 --> 02:40:02.796]  They openly threatened them.
[02:40:02.796 --> 02:40:03.577]  Now they back off.
[02:40:03.577 --> 02:40:04.797]  They go, that backfired.
[02:40:04.797 --> 02:40:08.900]  Let's just say they're going to crash them, then we crash them, which they're trying to do right now.
[02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:11.701]  So they're terrorizing you with these talking points.
[02:40:11.701 --> 02:40:13.302]  France can't have nationalism.
[02:40:13.302 --> 02:40:14.883]  France can't have any border checks.
[02:40:15.163 --> 02:40:17.025]  France can't have lower taxes.
[02:40:17.025 --> 02:40:20.788]  You know, the Conservatives in France only won a 50% federal tax.
[02:40:20.788 --> 02:40:22.009]  The Socialists won a 90%.
[02:40:22.009 --> 02:40:25.152]  Then of course don't pay it themselves.
[02:40:25.152 --> 02:40:28.615]  I mean, Le Pen's like a Democrat here.
[02:40:28.615 --> 02:40:31.017]  But in that world, oh my God, you're going to see.
[02:40:31.017 --> 02:40:31.858]  It's all just the same thing.
[02:40:31.858 --> 02:40:33.059]  You're going to crash the markets.
[02:40:33.059 --> 02:40:33.920]  The uncertainty.
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:36.442]  We're the ones that flooded you with people burning everything down.
[02:40:36.442 --> 02:40:37.763]  But you're the one that wants to fix it.
[02:40:37.763 --> 02:40:39.185]  So it's your fault, isn't it, lady?
[02:40:40.094 --> 02:40:40.494]  Go ahead.
[02:40:40.494 --> 02:40:41.735]  Who she is?
[02:40:41.735 --> 02:40:45.058]  Investors in the financial markets are nervous about you.
[02:40:45.058 --> 02:40:49.381]  Because you want to return France to the franc.
[02:40:49.381 --> 02:40:49.541]  Why?
[02:40:55.351 --> 02:40:57.253]  For a very simple reason.
[02:40:57.253 --> 02:41:02.216]  In reality, we are in control of our own country, so long as we have our own currency.
[02:41:02.216 --> 02:41:04.618]  Money is one of the elements of sovereignty.
[02:41:04.618 --> 02:41:12.464]  If you don't have your own currency, you allow others to impose on your economic policies, your immigration policies, your social policies.
[02:41:12.464 --> 02:41:18.548]  The political austerity that is imposed today by the European Union is founded on the euro.
[02:41:18.548 --> 02:41:19.589]  We are a free people.
[02:41:20.009 --> 02:41:21.190]  We fought for this.
[02:41:21.190 --> 02:41:23.252]  You too fought to be a free people.
[02:41:23.252 --> 02:41:31.959]  It was not so that today we could give it all away to technocrats that we have not elected, who decided for us which policies we should adopt.
[02:41:31.959 --> 02:41:43.229]  And I don't want to accept the euro, which is no longer a currency in the spirit of the European Union, but is in reality a weapon, that it sticks in our sides to force us to go where they please.
[02:41:43.869 --> 02:41:45.931]  The euro is a failure.
[02:41:45.931 --> 02:41:47.252]  It's an economic failure.
[02:41:47.252 --> 02:41:48.753]  It's a social failure.
[02:41:48.753 --> 02:42:01.942]  It's one of the reasons for which France has seen such a high rate of unemployment, for which France has become so much poorer, for which our industry has failed, for which we are confronted with an unfair international rivalry.
[02:42:01.942 --> 02:42:06.346]  There is no reason for us not to return to our own national currency.
[02:42:07.409 --> 02:42:12.050]  Notice you're hearing word for word what I've been saying for 15 years because I'm reading globalist documents.
[02:42:12.050 --> 02:42:22.174]  The technocrats admit they shut down industry, they take your tax money, they build factories in the third world, ship the goods back to fully consolidate more.
[02:42:22.174 --> 02:42:24.394]  It's called monopoly.
[02:42:24.394 --> 02:42:27.415]  And Bloomberg yesterday was like, how do we get rid of the monopoly?
[02:42:27.415 --> 02:42:30.096]  The UN will fix it when they're the ones setting it up.
[02:42:32.995 --> 02:42:37.338]  So here's this loving, nice woman who just wants a 50% tax.
[02:42:37.338 --> 02:42:38.159]  It's not an 80 or 90.
[02:42:38.159 --> 02:42:39.380]  I'm not kidding.
[02:42:39.380 --> 02:42:41.542]  Look it up.
[02:42:41.542 --> 02:42:43.824]  The highest tax bracket is 40 right now here.
[02:42:43.824 --> 02:42:44.624]  And they're freaking out.
[02:42:44.624 --> 02:42:48.347]  And where's the big thing about, ooh, a smart woman being president?
[02:42:48.347 --> 02:42:48.888]  Oh, no.
[02:42:48.888 --> 02:42:52.931]  Because you can't have that because she's a nationalist.
[02:42:52.931 --> 02:42:53.752]  She isn't.
[02:42:53.752 --> 02:42:54.873]  She isn't.
[02:42:54.873 --> 02:42:55.713]  She's not a pedophile.
[02:42:55.713 --> 02:42:59.696]  That's the big problem.
[02:42:59.696 --> 02:43:00.557]  But let's just get down to it.
[02:43:00.557 --> 02:43:01.338]  She's not a devil worshiper.
[02:43:02.261 --> 02:43:04.663]  I mean that, literally folks, that's the difference.
[02:43:04.663 --> 02:43:08.067]  And believe me, I know you haven't been at the highest level of Hollywood with some of you, which you don't want to be.
[02:43:08.067 --> 02:43:11.350]  I'm just like saying you haven't been in a port-a-potty, and you haven't been around the elites.
[02:43:11.350 --> 02:43:17.196]  Let me just tell you something right now.
[02:43:17.196 --> 02:43:21.200]  They're all involved in some real bad stuff.
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:23.202]  Bare minimum, devil worship.
[02:43:23.202 --> 02:43:25.605]  And I mean devil worship.
[02:43:29.185 --> 02:43:33.047]  I mean stuff that'll curl your hair.
[02:43:33.047 --> 02:43:37.670]  And I mean some bad mojo going on.
[02:43:37.670 --> 02:43:41.552]  You don't... I'm talking the candles getting knocked out.
[02:43:41.552 --> 02:43:44.093]  They're not doing all this just because they're playing games.
[02:43:44.093 --> 02:43:50.857]  They're jacking into some bad stuff.
[02:43:50.857 --> 02:43:52.158]  Look at LePen versus Hillary.
[02:43:53.032 --> 02:44:02.096]  Let's put that woman up, her loving eyes, calm, focused, intelligent, well-spoken, feminine, all the feminine energy just there to help you.
[02:44:02.096 --> 02:44:04.337]  And then you look at Hillary Clinton, a fricking demon.
[02:44:04.337 --> 02:44:10.180]  I mean, Hillary's... And you know, that's Hillary.
[02:44:10.180 --> 02:44:10.900]  That's who she is.
[02:44:10.900 --> 02:44:14.061]  And then all of you that serve them, why are you doing it?
[02:44:14.061 --> 02:44:15.742]  Because there's a spirit.
[02:44:15.742 --> 02:44:21.785]  I was in D.C., and I'd be in a restaurant or something, get something to eat, and like, leftists would walk up, and I'd be sitting there, and they'd walk over, just going like,
[02:44:23.749 --> 02:44:24.910]  Yeah, that's not her demon face.
[02:44:24.910 --> 02:44:25.530]  That's nothing.
[02:44:25.530 --> 02:44:26.151]  I'm telling you, man.
[02:44:26.151 --> 02:44:29.853]  There's shots of her you see all the time when she's smiling in public, where she looks like a shark.
[02:44:29.853 --> 02:44:31.454]  Point is, there's no soul there.
[02:44:31.454 --> 02:44:34.216]  And, pull up the one with her and Bill walking around.
[02:44:34.216 --> 02:44:37.939]  And they would just walk over, just like burning, like, Hi Alex!
[02:44:37.939 --> 02:44:39.500]  And I'm like, are you on drugs?
[02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:39.860]  You're not.
[02:44:39.860 --> 02:44:43.763]  You're just on this power trip that you're gonna dominate me, and it's a spirit!
[02:44:43.763 --> 02:44:44.043]  Get away!
[02:44:45.759 --> 02:44:47.640]  Yeah, that's her looking goofy.
[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:49.661]  I don't know, it's like the most evil ones.
[02:44:49.661 --> 02:44:51.102]  I've told you, yeah, that's her.
[02:44:51.102 --> 02:44:52.602]  I mean, they all run bad to worse.
[02:44:52.602 --> 02:44:57.065]  The point is, this is a demon whose job was representing pedophiles as soon as she got out of law school.
[02:44:57.065 --> 02:44:58.545]  That's what she did.
[02:44:58.545 --> 02:45:07.770]  You know, if eight guys grab a girl and rape her so bad that she has a prolapse, you know, just wreck her body for life, that's okay!
[02:45:07.770 --> 02:45:09.991]  Because, you know, they're pedophiles!
[02:45:09.991 --> 02:45:11.892]  That's who Hillary likes, and she makes jokes about it.
[02:45:12.574 --> 02:45:14.156]  Now that's a good picture of her.
[02:45:14.156 --> 02:45:16.198]  That's what she looks like now.
[02:45:16.198 --> 02:45:18.660]  And boy, she's circling that toilet bowl to hell, isn't she?
[02:45:18.660 --> 02:45:19.822]  That's a good thing.
[02:45:19.822 --> 02:45:21.383]  Let's go back to Marie LePen.
[02:45:21.383 --> 02:45:23.986]  LePen, we will leave EU to restore sovereignty.
[02:45:23.986 --> 02:45:24.306]  Here it is.
[02:45:25.157 --> 02:45:28.940]  So if you become the leader of France, would there be a referendum?
[02:45:28.940 --> 02:45:33.744]  How would it work, a return to the franc?
[02:45:33.744 --> 02:45:39.168]  I very clearly said that I would organize a referendum six months after my election.
[02:45:39.168 --> 02:45:43.692]  Not only on whether to leave the euro, but on whether to leave the European Union.
[02:45:43.692 --> 02:45:47.335]  I would use these six months to negotiate with the European Union.
[02:45:47.335 --> 02:45:49.817]  Could you give us back our territorial sovereignty?
[02:45:49.817 --> 02:45:52.539]  Our monetary, budgetary, economic sovereignty?
[02:45:52.899 --> 02:45:53.919]  You will?
[02:45:53.919 --> 02:45:54.620]  Very well.
[02:45:54.620 --> 02:45:57.180]  We can stay in this new European Union.
[02:45:57.180 --> 02:45:58.541]  You will not?
[02:45:58.541 --> 02:46:02.582]  So then I will ask the French people to leave the European Union.
[02:46:02.582 --> 02:46:05.462]  You know, I do not feel isolated at all.
[02:46:05.462 --> 02:46:15.505]  What has happened in Great Britain, what has happened in the United States, the upcoming Austrian presidential election, I am sure of the loss of the referendum of Mr. Renzi soon.
[02:46:15.505 --> 02:46:21.247]  All these elements show that in reality, the people support what I've been proposing for many years.
[02:46:21.247 --> 02:46:21.727]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[02:46:22.307 --> 02:46:26.951]  We want to regain our liberty and bring about the policies that we want.
[02:46:26.951 --> 02:46:38.602]  Of course the big financial powers aren't very happy, since in reality they have gorged themselves and made their riches on all these norms and regulations and currency that they've imposed on us.
[02:46:38.602 --> 02:46:42.286]  But as I've said, it's the return of the people.
[02:46:42.286 --> 02:46:45.709]  I'm fighting for the people, not for the financial markets.
[02:46:46.792 --> 02:46:47.973]  And they hate her, it's just like Trump.
[02:46:47.973 --> 02:46:49.375]  She's genuine, just like Nigel Farage.
[02:46:49.375 --> 02:46:56.043]  You just look at them and their actions, they're just... I mean, I've been to dinner with Farage and you name it, all of them, they're just real.
[02:46:56.043 --> 02:46:58.526]  Totally real, totally your spirit's just calm.
[02:46:58.526 --> 02:47:00.768]  You, like, feel good, like, oh, these are good people.
[02:47:00.768 --> 02:47:03.832]  You get around Hillary and people, they're like... floating around.
[02:47:03.832 --> 02:47:06.134]  I mean, it is... it's good versus evil.
[02:47:07.285 --> 02:47:11.929]  And I should give, you know, I always say it's Russia 18 years ago that began pulling out of globalism.
[02:47:11.929 --> 02:47:14.591]  But if you look at the Euro, who else gets credit?
[02:47:14.591 --> 02:47:18.815]  Le Pen and her dad, 30 years.
[02:47:18.815 --> 02:47:21.077]  When they started starting the Euro, he was warning about it.
[02:47:21.077 --> 02:47:22.538]  And then she's been fighting for a good 15.
[02:47:22.538 --> 02:47:24.680]  She's run for president before.
[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:27.582]  She's almost beaten it before.
[02:47:27.582 --> 02:47:32.186]  So, everybody wants to bash France all day and, you know, equate cowardism with the French and everything.
[02:47:34.122 --> 02:47:37.203]  Okay, well we were following them getting out of the system.
[02:47:37.203 --> 02:47:38.984]  But we weren't under it as much were we here.
[02:47:38.984 --> 02:47:41.064]  Now we began to see we were going under it.
[02:47:41.064 --> 02:47:46.706]  So this is all just free will common sense of not being conquered.
[02:47:46.706 --> 02:47:49.687]  And they tell us because we're all Russian agents.
[02:47:49.687 --> 02:47:59.611]  That's right, her dad 30 years ago fought the EU as one of their top people in government as a war hero and a nationalist because he was a Russian agent, yeah.
[02:47:59.611 --> 02:48:02.452]  Sure, he was in Eastern money too.
[02:48:02.452 --> 02:48:02.672]  So,
[02:48:06.459 --> 02:48:12.503]  I remember Bob Chapman and a lot of other folks knew LePen and her dad, and they're like anti-New World Order stuff all the way.
[02:48:12.503 --> 02:48:18.768]  I mean, I can tell you Marie LePen, that's why they hate her so much, she is totally dialed in.
[02:48:18.768 --> 02:48:21.830]  When I was a little kid, she was away.
[02:48:21.830 --> 02:48:24.292]  And it turns out anybody informed knows about this.
[02:48:24.292 --> 02:48:27.734]  This is the real world, but now the general public is learning about it.
[02:48:27.734 --> 02:48:28.855]  I need to fund the operation.
[02:48:30.222 --> 02:48:31.585]  And I had them mix this up for me.
[02:48:31.585 --> 02:48:32.628]  I appreciate whoever did it.
[02:48:32.628 --> 02:48:33.570]  I didn't see who did it.
[02:48:33.570 --> 02:48:36.638]  I just asked them to make me a big, juicy... Buckley did.
[02:48:36.638 --> 02:48:39.565]  A big, juicy, delicious caveman shake.
[02:48:40.694 --> 02:48:53.897]  Put in a few scoops, add water if you want it to be even creamier, add a little more calories, milk, and it is all the collagen and all the bones boiled down into something that makes whey look like a joke.
[02:48:53.897 --> 02:49:08.040]  I mean, this is what the weightlifters do, it's what the NFL does, and I went out and looked at the brands that were out there and said, I want something double strong for less the price, and it is Caveman Ultimate True Paleo Formula.
[02:49:12.688 --> 02:49:19.655]  It tastes like a chocolate shake.
[02:49:19.655 --> 02:49:28.103]  In fact, I'm going to start at home doing this with my kids with ice, because you put some ice in there and it is just unbelievable.
[02:49:28.103 --> 02:49:31.566]  I've been mixing it and really liking it, saying it tastes like Ovaltine, and then Buckley brought me some.
[02:49:31.566 --> 02:49:32.447]  I said, this is even better.
[02:49:32.447 --> 02:49:32.908]  I brought him in.
[02:49:32.908 --> 02:49:33.788]  How did you mix this?
[02:49:33.788 --> 02:49:34.950]  He goes, oh, I put milk in it.
[02:49:35.606 --> 02:49:40.568]  So you add a couple hundred calories in there or whatever and you add some milk or, you know, whatever, it gets even better.
[02:49:40.568 --> 02:49:44.870]  But it tastes really good, just, you know, water and a couple scoops of it, and it helps fund our operation.
[02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:54.675]  Out of the gates, it's discounted 33%, or 33.36% if you want to get down to brass tacks, and it is an amazing product.
[02:49:54.675 --> 02:49:57.556]  But again, it funds the operation, so thank you all for your support.
[02:49:59.622 --> 02:50:11.151]  If you go back to why the ancients were so much stronger and so much smarter, a lot of the evidence points towards not just the physical labor and the rest of it, but obviously the fact that they were obsessed with grinding down bones for their bread, bones for their soup.
[02:50:11.151 --> 02:50:19.538]  I mean, the ancients all believed the bones were the most important part of the meat because the marrow, speaking of the French, that's their delicacy.
[02:50:19.538 --> 02:50:22.500]  And I can't really find steak restaurants that have it much.
[02:50:22.500 --> 02:50:27.904]  You run into it some in Europe with big old juicy cow thigh bones chopped up and then marrow.
[02:50:29.085 --> 02:50:31.126]  With some onions on it, oh my God.
[02:50:31.126 --> 02:50:36.029]  The point is, is that that's what this is filled with, and it is amazing.

[02:54:09.590 --> 02:54:12.110]  Anthony Kennedy is coming up before Bauer.
[02:54:12.110 --> 02:54:13.250]  Man, Trump's doing it.
[02:54:13.250 --> 02:54:14.550]  He sent a shot across their bow.
[02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:18.111]  He said Hillary was connected to the Russians and took money from them.
[02:54:18.111 --> 02:54:19.371]  You know what connections I have?
[02:54:19.371 --> 02:54:21.492]  Nothing.
[02:54:21.492 --> 02:54:23.992]  And so they just keep pushing.
[02:54:23.992 --> 02:54:27.113]  John McCain's got all those connections to Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:54:27.113 --> 02:54:29.373]  On video meeting with top leaders of it, thinks he's protected.
[02:54:33.953 --> 02:54:38.735]  You know what, the American people have been real nice for a long time.
[02:54:38.735 --> 02:54:59.446]  Been trying to fix stuff in a nice way, but when you got CIA people on TV saying that Trump's a domestic enemy, and people saying he should be killed, and all he's trying to do is heal this country and help poor people, and secure our borders, and get that screwjob Obamacare off our backs, and get the big banks loaning people money.
[02:55:00.902 --> 02:55:05.204]  I'm going to tell people something that's not coming from me, but I'm hearing the talk all over.
[02:55:05.204 --> 02:55:07.465]  From people that don't talk, you're going to get hurt real bad.
[02:55:07.465 --> 02:55:11.407]  But I know people like you always run your mouths.
[02:55:11.407 --> 02:55:12.287]  Hey, I'm not running my mouth.
[02:55:12.287 --> 02:55:13.627]  I'm ready for whatever happens to me.
[02:55:13.627 --> 02:55:14.748]  I'm all in.
[02:55:14.748 --> 02:55:15.688]  They threaten me sometimes.
[02:55:15.688 --> 02:55:18.069]  I go, you think I didn't know you're a bunch of killers?
[02:55:18.069 --> 02:55:24.752]  Well, I guess you didn't know I already knew.
[02:55:24.752 --> 02:55:26.253]  I'm looking for a fight, dumbasses.
[02:55:28.183 --> 02:55:30.848]  I've already run over you politically up one side and down the other.
[02:55:30.848 --> 02:55:34.394]  You ready for the next level?
[02:55:34.394 --> 02:55:38.961]  Quite frankly, it's like an 800-pound man beating up a 30-pound weasel.
[02:55:38.961 --> 02:55:41.546]  That's not something I even want to do, but you'll see what happens when you keep pushing.
[02:55:42.688 --> 02:55:43.468]  I want to go to these clips.
[02:55:43.468 --> 02:55:44.289]  Niko's got a couple of them.
[02:55:44.289 --> 02:55:46.650]  Here's Donald Trump destroys CNN reporter.
[02:55:46.650 --> 02:55:47.851]  Here it is.
[02:55:47.851 --> 02:55:49.432]  It seems that there's a disconnect there.
[02:55:49.432 --> 02:55:53.734]  If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?
[02:55:53.734 --> 02:55:54.895]  No, the reporting is fake.
[02:55:54.895 --> 02:55:57.016]  I just want to ask- Kim, you know what it is?
[02:55:57.016 --> 02:55:58.316]  Here's the thing.
[02:55:58.316 --> 02:56:03.319]  The public isn't, you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch.
[02:56:03.319 --> 02:56:07.942]  They don't know if it's true or false because they're not involved.
[02:56:07.942 --> 02:56:08.542]  I'm involved.
[02:56:08.542 --> 02:56:11.664]  I've been involved with this stuff all my life, but I'm involved.
[02:56:12.992 --> 02:56:15.274]  So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not.
[02:56:15.274 --> 02:56:15.554]  That's key.
[02:56:15.554 --> 02:56:16.615]  He's in the middle of it.
[02:56:16.615 --> 02:56:18.697]  I just see many, many untruthful things.
[02:56:18.697 --> 02:56:19.718]  And I'll tell you what else I see.
[02:56:19.718 --> 02:56:20.378]  I see tone.
[02:56:20.378 --> 02:56:22.380]  You know the word tone.
[02:56:22.380 --> 02:56:24.002]  The tone is such hatred.
[02:56:24.002 --> 02:56:25.723]  You got an attitude.
[02:56:25.723 --> 02:56:27.765]  I'm really not a bad person, by the way.
[02:56:27.765 --> 02:56:31.568]  No, but the tone is such... I do get good ratings, you have to admit that.
[02:56:31.568 --> 02:56:35.491]  The tone is such hatred.
[02:56:35.491 --> 02:56:40.556]  I watched this morning a couple of the networks, and I have to say, Fox and Friends in the morning,
[02:56:41.829 --> 02:56:44.351]  They're very honorable people.
[02:56:44.351 --> 02:56:48.934]  Not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong.
[02:56:48.934 --> 02:56:52.057]  But they have the most honest morning show.
[02:56:52.057 --> 02:56:52.877]  That's all I can say.
[02:56:52.877 --> 02:56:53.538]  It's the most honest.
[02:56:53.538 --> 02:56:55.499]  But the tone, Jim.
[02:56:55.499 --> 02:56:58.522]  If you look, the hatred.
[02:56:58.522 --> 02:57:04.106]  I mean, sometimes somebody gets... Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening.
[02:57:05.581 --> 02:57:07.161]  You just take a look at that show.
[02:57:07.161 --> 02:57:09.042]  That is a constant hit.
[02:57:09.042 --> 02:57:12.222]  The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump.
[02:57:12.222 --> 02:57:13.442]  They're calling for his overthrow and death.
[02:57:13.442 --> 02:57:14.583]  He doesn't have good ratings.
[02:57:14.583 --> 02:57:18.603]  But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump.
[02:57:18.603 --> 02:57:22.104]  And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth.
[02:57:22.104 --> 02:57:25.585]  The hatred coming from other people on your network.
[02:57:25.585 --> 02:57:28.485]  Now, I will say this.
[02:57:28.485 --> 02:57:29.585]  I watch it.
[02:57:29.585 --> 02:57:30.966]  I see it.
[02:57:30.966 --> 02:57:31.946]  I'm amazed by it.
[02:57:33.360 --> 02:57:36.222]  And I just think you'd be a lot better if I honestly do.
[02:57:36.222 --> 02:57:37.543]  The public gets it, you know.
[02:57:37.543 --> 02:57:40.425]  Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN.
[02:57:40.425 --> 02:57:44.787]  They want to throw their placards at CNN, you know.
[02:57:44.787 --> 02:57:48.130]  I think you would do much better by being different.
[02:57:48.130 --> 02:57:48.830]  They're tools, though.
[02:57:48.830 --> 02:57:49.330]  They're a weapon.
[02:57:49.330 --> 02:57:51.572]  Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening.
[02:57:52.751 --> 02:57:57.653]  If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's brutal.
[02:57:57.653 --> 02:57:58.233]  Well, they shut him down.
[02:57:58.233 --> 02:57:59.673]  Now, they'll take this news conference.
[02:57:59.673 --> 02:58:01.734]  I'm actually having a very good time, okay?
[02:58:01.734 --> 02:58:03.114]  But they'll take this news conference.
[02:58:03.114 --> 02:58:04.595]  Don't forget, that's the way I won.
[02:58:04.595 --> 02:58:08.076]  Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.
[02:58:08.956 --> 02:58:09.437]  Okay?
[02:58:09.437 --> 02:58:10.458]  No, that's how I won.
[02:58:10.458 --> 02:58:12.600]  I won with news coverage and probably speeches.
[02:58:12.600 --> 02:58:13.821]  I certainly didn't win by people.
[02:58:13.821 --> 02:58:14.681]  He's told his people to shut up.
[02:58:14.681 --> 02:58:16.183]  He's doing what he wants now.
[02:58:16.183 --> 02:58:17.704]  But I'm having a good time.
[02:58:17.704 --> 02:58:22.268]  Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.
[02:58:22.268 --> 02:58:23.349]  I'm not ranting and raving.
[02:58:23.349 --> 02:58:25.331]  I'm just telling you, you know, you're dishonest people.
[02:58:25.331 --> 02:58:27.933]  But, but, I'm not ranting and raving.
[02:58:27.933 --> 02:58:28.374]  I love this.
[02:58:28.374 --> 02:58:30.155]  I'm having a good time doing it.
[02:58:30.155 --> 02:58:34.279]  But tomorrow the headlines are going to be, Donald Trump rants and raves.
[02:58:35.467 --> 02:58:36.829]  I'm not ranting, I'm not ranting.
[02:58:36.829 --> 02:58:37.691]  We'll be back.
[02:58:37.691 --> 02:58:38.672]  Scum's attacking him.
[02:58:38.672 --> 02:58:40.655]  He's just laying them out with the truth.
[02:58:40.655 --> 02:58:43.239]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:43.239 --> 02:58:45.042]  Fourth Hour straight ahead.
[02:58:45.042 --> 02:58:45.983]  Anthony Cumia coming up.
[02:58:45.983 --> 02:58:46.524]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:50.077 --> 02:58:57.341]  Since the federal judge has halted Trump's executive order, 60% of the refugee arrivals to the United States have come from terror-prone countries.
[02:58:57.341 --> 02:58:59.102]  In fact, the most terror-prone.
[02:58:59.102 --> 02:58:59.623]  Since U.S.
[02:58:59.623 --> 02:59:10.489]  District Judge James Robart's restraining order, the United States has taken 532 refugees from Syria, a civil war-torn country ripe with terrorists, in which President Assad of Syria and U.S.
[02:59:10.489 --> 02:59:14.752]  intelligence agencies said are infiltrating refugee groups.
[02:59:14.752 --> 02:59:18.074]  472 refugees from Iraq, where Americans can't even go out on the streets,
[02:59:18.614 --> 02:59:24.781]  363 from Somalia, where we already had a refugee stab 11 people at Ohio State.
[02:59:24.781 --> 02:59:32.528]  117 refugees from Iran, where they just last week held a march, where they marched on the American flag and chanted death to the US in the streets.
[02:59:32.528 --> 02:59:36.232]  And 65 are from Sudan, a failed state, for a total of 1,549 refugees.
[02:59:38.134 --> 02:59:39.274]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:03.157 --> 03:00:06.761]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:00:06.761 --> 03:00:10.925]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.570 --> 03:00:23.154]  The way Priebus gets you to quit is he says the president wants you to quit, then stampedes you into it.
[03:00:23.154 --> 03:00:26.116]  And Trump's basically come out twice now and signaled that's what happened.
[03:00:26.116 --> 03:00:29.379]  Finishing up with this one deal where he was talking to one of the reporters.
[03:00:29.379 --> 03:00:34.023]  He makes a joke at the end, he just appointed this new secretary, the last name Acosta, or Acusta.
[03:00:34.023 --> 03:00:37.125]  And then he says, I better real check the other guy's background, because your name's that.
[03:00:37.125 --> 03:00:38.506]  It's a funny joke.
[03:00:38.506 --> 03:00:40.127]  But here he is finishing up, tearing up CNN.
[03:00:40.908 --> 03:00:41.989]  That's for sure.
[03:00:41.989 --> 03:00:43.511]  But I'm having a good time.
[03:00:43.511 --> 03:00:48.076]  Tomorrow, they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.
[03:00:48.076 --> 03:00:49.157]  I'm not ranting and raving.
[03:00:49.157 --> 03:00:51.140]  I'm just telling you, you're dishonest people.
[03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:53.743]  But I'm not ranting and raving.
[03:00:53.743 --> 03:00:54.203]  I love this.
[03:00:54.203 --> 03:00:55.965]  I'm having a good time doing it.
[03:00:55.965 --> 03:01:00.090]  But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be Donald Trump rants and raves.
[03:01:03.433 --> 03:01:04.013]  One more follow.
[03:01:04.013 --> 03:01:05.594]  Should I let him have a little bit more?
[03:01:05.594 --> 03:01:07.035]  What do you think, Peter?
[03:01:07.035 --> 03:01:09.137]  Peter, should I let him have a little bit more?
[03:01:09.137 --> 03:01:09.557]  Sit down.
[03:01:09.557 --> 03:01:10.377]  Sit down.
[03:01:10.377 --> 03:01:11.538]  We'll get it.
[03:01:11.538 --> 03:01:18.002]  Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir... I'm changing it from fake news, though.
[03:01:18.002 --> 03:01:19.763]  Doesn't that under... Very fake news.
[03:01:19.763 --> 03:01:22.465]  I know, but aren't you... Very fake.
[03:01:23.576 --> 03:01:24.476]  Go ahead.
[03:01:24.476 --> 03:01:26.117]  Real news, Mr. President, real news.
[03:01:26.117 --> 03:01:30.058]  And you're not related to our new... I am not related, sir, no.
[03:01:30.058 --> 03:01:32.359]  I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.
[03:01:32.359 --> 03:01:36.881]  You know, I looked at that name, I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there, Alex Acosta?
[03:01:36.881 --> 03:01:37.941]  I'm sure you checked that out, sir.
[03:01:37.941 --> 03:01:44.063]  No, I checked it, but I said, they said, no, sir, I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree.
[03:01:44.063 --> 03:01:49.925]  So there you go, he tries to charm these snakes, but it doesn't matter, they've got orders to go in and take him down.
[03:01:49.925 --> 03:01:51.046]  Do we have Anthony coming in here with us?
[03:01:52.901 --> 03:01:54.942]  I want to bring him in on his own hour.
[03:01:54.942 --> 03:01:57.144]  I appreciate him co-hosting every few weeks here on the show.
[03:01:57.144 --> 03:01:59.245]  I enjoyed doing his broadcast the other day.
[03:01:59.245 --> 03:02:00.786]  I was pretty wound up by the time I got on his show.
[03:02:00.786 --> 03:02:02.928]  People were like, man, you need some Prozac, Alex.
[03:02:02.928 --> 03:02:03.888]  But I'm really pissed.
[03:02:03.888 --> 03:02:06.530]  I mean, you see communists beating up women everywhere.
[03:02:06.530 --> 03:02:09.412]  Communists are like attacking cat sanctuaries in Austin.
[03:02:09.412 --> 03:02:09.972]  I'm not kidding.
[03:02:09.972 --> 03:02:13.375]  And the left goes, well, it is a white-owned cat sanctuary.
[03:02:13.375 --> 03:02:15.156]  And it's whites attacking it.
[03:02:15.156 --> 03:02:19.579]  And I mean, it's just it's so crazy now that I'm starting to go crazy myself.
[03:02:19.579 --> 03:02:21.720]  And I just wonder where all this is going.
[03:02:23.601 --> 03:02:26.443]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen, the TV viewers.
[03:02:26.443 --> 03:02:28.245]  I am literally brain-sucking.
[03:02:28.245 --> 03:02:31.046]  There you are.
[03:02:31.046 --> 03:02:31.947]  Oh, wow.
[03:02:31.947 --> 03:02:32.888]  I'm all over the place.
[03:02:32.888 --> 03:02:35.789]  Hey, what's coming up today as you transmit worldwide, my friend?
[03:02:38.155 --> 03:02:46.860]  Oh man, obviously the Flynn situation and how the media has just spun this around.
[03:02:46.860 --> 03:02:48.762]  The immigration thing.
[03:02:48.762 --> 03:02:52.524]  I guess today is a day without immigrants.
[03:02:52.524 --> 03:02:53.424]  I guess that's it.
[03:02:53.424 --> 03:02:57.547]  They perpetually leave out the word illegal.
[03:02:57.547 --> 03:02:58.688]  I really... Exactly.
[03:02:58.688 --> 03:03:00.409]  Everything's a deception.
[03:03:00.409 --> 03:03:01.449]  Everyone's against immigrants.
[03:03:01.449 --> 03:03:01.809]  No we're not.
[03:03:01.809 --> 03:03:03.991]  We just don't want rapists coming in and being let loose.
[03:03:05.191 --> 03:03:07.473]  And for some reason that's a problem.
[03:03:07.473 --> 03:03:27.329]  I can't understand why they have a problem with strong borders, strong military, jobs being back here in the United States, and they just give misinformation about all of these things to try to make Trump look like such a bad guy, make his supporters look like the Nazis that they're calling everyone.
[03:03:27.349 --> 03:03:31.231]  The good news is, I'm out of here in a minute, you're going to take over and I'll be listening, so work around the office, Anthony Cumia.
[03:03:31.231 --> 03:03:32.931]  Let me ask you this question.
[03:03:32.931 --> 03:03:38.974]  His approval rating keeps exploding upwards in every poll, and those are even Cook polls, so what does that signify?
[03:03:38.974 --> 03:03:45.016]  It signifies that the people that matter, the American people, are all for what he's doing.
[03:03:45.016 --> 03:03:47.097]  They want a strong country.
[03:03:47.097 --> 03:03:49.818]  They want law and order.
[03:03:49.818 --> 03:03:54.080]  Just the other day, a six-year-old kid, I guess,
[03:03:54.600 --> 03:03:58.283]  A shot in the head in Chicago due to gang violence?
[03:03:58.283 --> 03:04:03.508]  That just is supposed to go on and on and no one's supposed to say anything about it?
[03:04:03.508 --> 03:04:08.672]  And then if Trump says something about it for some reason that's a race baiting or something?
[03:04:08.672 --> 03:04:18.701]  He wants to solve some of the biggest problems we've had in this country and they keep throwing speed bumps and roadblocks in his way for what reason?
[03:04:19.261 --> 03:04:20.242]  I have no idea.
[03:04:20.242 --> 03:04:22.043]  They're insane?
[03:04:22.043 --> 03:04:29.708]  They don't want to relinquish any of the power that they've built up over the years by lying to the American people?
[03:04:29.708 --> 03:04:30.429]  It's beyond me.
[03:04:49.441 --> 03:04:51.724]  Creatures that just think they own us, and guess what?
[03:04:51.724 --> 03:04:52.524]  They don't.
[03:04:52.524 --> 03:04:54.306]  Everywhere nationalism is exploding.
[03:04:54.306 --> 03:04:57.249]  Anthony Comey, it takes over after this break.
[03:04:57.249 --> 03:04:57.769]  Thanks Alex.
[03:04:59.946 --> 03:05:05.031]  In a protest against Donald Trump's tight citizenship policy, a day without immigrants has been declared nationwide.
[03:05:05.031 --> 03:05:10.416]  Today, February 16th, 2017, will go down in history as a day without immigrants.
[03:05:10.416 --> 03:05:11.137]  Look around you.
[03:05:11.137 --> 03:05:12.418]  Is that person an immigrant?
[03:05:12.418 --> 03:05:14.140]  Imagine if they were just gone.
[03:05:14.140 --> 03:05:15.001]  But wait a second.
[03:05:15.001 --> 03:05:17.143]  This ideal or illustration doesn't make sense.
[03:05:17.143 --> 03:05:18.944]  President Trump is not deporting immigrants.
[03:05:18.944 --> 03:05:22.448]  In fact, I'm yet to see or hear any policy that deals directly with just immigrants.
[03:05:22.648 --> 03:05:24.431]  So, are citizens of the U.S.
[03:05:24.431 --> 03:05:31.501]  that have immigrated here going to take off work in protest for those who want to skirt the legal process that they went through to be an immigrant?
[03:05:31.501 --> 03:05:32.642]  An interesting notion.
[03:05:32.642 --> 03:05:38.911]  Or will this just be a bunch of self-loathing white liberal college students and older women like usual in a desperate attempt to virtue signal against Trump?
[03:05:39.251 --> 03:05:43.495]  Or, will non-citizens show up and proudly announce that they work here illegally?
[03:05:43.495 --> 03:05:47.178]  The goal of this protest is to display how imperative immigrants are to society.
[03:05:47.178 --> 03:05:49.079]  Guess we will find that out real quick.
[03:05:49.079 --> 03:05:56.786]  Or, we will see that people who immigrated here came here to work for a better life and have better things to do than protest a process that they followed.
[03:05:56.786 --> 03:05:59.028]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:05:59.708 --> 03:06:01.588]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:06:01.588 --> 03:06:03.609]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:06:03.609 --> 03:06:06.530]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:06:06.530 --> 03:06:12.571]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:06:12.571 --> 03:06:21.773]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:06:21.773 --> 03:06:26.634]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[03:06:26.854 --> 03:06:29.298]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:06:29.298 --> 03:06:37.330]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:06:37.330 --> 03:06:38.311]  The general public doesn't.
[03:06:39.518 --> 03:06:42.882]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:06:42.882 --> 03:06:47.026]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:06:47.026 --> 03:06:53.733]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[03:06:53.733 --> 03:06:57.837]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[03:07:00.137 --> 03:07:01.978]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[03:07:01.978 --> 03:07:08.580]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[03:07:08.580 --> 03:07:11.741]  We are now introducing Caveman by mfolordslife.com.
[03:07:11.741 --> 03:07:21.524]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[03:07:21.524 --> 03:07:22.365]  Caveman.
[03:07:22.365 --> 03:07:27.426]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[03:07:27.426 --> 03:07:29.547]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[03:07:29.847 --> 03:07:32.988]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[03:07:32.988 --> 03:07:38.130]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[03:07:38.130 --> 03:07:46.213]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[03:07:46.213 --> 03:07:54.076]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[03:07:54.076 --> 03:07:58.878]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today.
[03:08:13.010 --> 03:08:29.928]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[03:08:29.928 --> 03:08:31.930]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:08:38.084 --> 03:08:44.070]  Alright, Anthony Acumia in for InfoWars.com.
[03:08:44.070 --> 03:08:57.603]  Wow, you know, every time I do this show, I love doing it, love doing InfoWars, but after my previous show, I think, my God, what am I going to talk about next time I'm on?
[03:08:57.603 --> 03:08:59.865]  And they just keep coming up with new stuff.
[03:09:01.547 --> 03:09:14.162]  It's so blatantly obvious that the left, which is the media, and the media, celebrities, the Hollywood elite, they are constantly
[03:09:15.542 --> 03:09:22.369]  Throwing temper tantrums and throwing roadblocks in the way of what the president wants to do.
[03:09:22.369 --> 03:09:30.856]  President Donald Trump, by the way, in case they need a constant reminder that he is indeed your president.
[03:09:30.856 --> 03:09:32.938]  Not my president, really?
[03:09:32.938 --> 03:09:33.699]  Where do you live?
[03:09:33.699 --> 03:09:35.621]  In the United States?
[03:09:35.621 --> 03:09:36.942]  He's your president.
[03:09:36.942 --> 03:09:37.883]  Enough with the drama.
[03:09:39.105 --> 03:09:41.448]  And they really do love drama.
[03:09:41.448 --> 03:09:55.227]  Boy, you'd think that stereotype that the drama club and drama class in school years ago was like, oh, they're all just drama queens, all of them.
[03:09:55.227 --> 03:09:56.248]  They grew up.
[03:09:56.969 --> 03:10:11.267]  To remain the drama queens, the liberal thoughts, the everything is a catastrophe, the sky is falling because, what, laws are being enforced?
[03:10:12.468 --> 03:10:18.070]  Rules that have been in place for a while are being enforced?
[03:10:18.070 --> 03:10:19.291]  Is that a problem?
[03:10:19.291 --> 03:10:21.551]  Apparently it is.
[03:10:21.551 --> 03:10:30.174]  Because today, my goodness, today is a day without immigrants.
[03:10:30.174 --> 03:10:33.475]  My God, how will we function?
[03:10:33.475 --> 03:10:34.816]  How are we going to function?
[03:10:36.307 --> 03:10:45.311]  Oh, I have Mr. Garrett Rodriguez in the booth.
[03:10:45.311 --> 03:10:49.093]  John is in here.
[03:10:49.093 --> 03:10:54.795]  John Pedro Morales is also in the booth.
[03:10:54.795 --> 03:10:58.977]  They showed up for work, two of my favorite Hispanic engineers.
[03:11:01.698 --> 03:11:04.380]  These things never work.
[03:11:04.380 --> 03:11:14.349]  They're just another one of these liberal things that they love the drama, like I was just saying, and they want to make a scene.
[03:11:14.349 --> 03:11:21.035]  They love being seen and being part of something that they think is noble.
[03:11:21.035 --> 03:11:24.658]  So they've dubbed this day
[03:11:26.313 --> 03:11:28.114]  A day without immigrants.
[03:11:28.114 --> 03:11:32.195]  Now, first of all, right from the start, let's get this straight.
[03:11:32.195 --> 03:11:40.838]  When the hell did Trump say anything negative about legal immigrants coming into this country?
[03:11:41.978 --> 03:11:58.447]  From what I recall, everything he said about immigration and legal immigrants that go through the system and come to this country and assimilate, they raise families, they work, they pay taxes, just like every other American.
[03:11:58.447 --> 03:11:59.127]  You know why?
[03:11:59.127 --> 03:12:01.609]  Because they are now Americans.
[03:12:01.609 --> 03:12:03.390]  That's how it works.
[03:12:03.390 --> 03:12:11.054]  I've never heard him speak ill will of any immigrant group that was coming here to this country.
[03:12:12.412 --> 03:12:16.374]  Now that does not include illegal aliens.
[03:12:16.374 --> 03:12:19.035]  Yes, I still like the term alien.
[03:12:19.035 --> 03:12:19.935]  I like it.
[03:12:19.935 --> 03:12:24.216]  Reminds me of one of my favorite movies of the same name, Alien.
[03:12:24.216 --> 03:12:35.020]  But it's illegal alien or refugees who just get this free pass over anybody that's actually going through the system.
[03:12:35.020 --> 03:12:41.303]  I know it's quite an arduous system to get into the United States legally, as well it should be.
[03:12:41.863 --> 03:12:45.586]  This is a damn fine place to be in the world.
[03:12:45.586 --> 03:12:53.453]  If you gaze around this globe of ours, you'll see a lot of places that are crap holes.
[03:12:53.453 --> 03:12:55.875]  People dying of starvation in 2017.
[03:12:58.317 --> 03:13:09.544]  They don't have the knowledge or they are under some dictator's thumb that keep them from getting the very basics in life.
[03:13:09.544 --> 03:13:12.285]  Food, water, things like that.
[03:13:12.285 --> 03:13:12.726]  America?
[03:13:14.068 --> 03:13:17.269]  No one is dying of dehydration.
[03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:19.109]  No one is starving.
[03:13:19.109 --> 03:13:24.570]  Are there malnutrition, are there kids with malnutrition and people who go hungry?
[03:13:24.570 --> 03:13:25.430]  Yes.
[03:13:25.430 --> 03:13:26.811]  That's a shame.
[03:13:26.811 --> 03:13:32.932]  But I'll tell you what, no one is dying in the streets from starvation.
[03:13:32.932 --> 03:13:38.173]  In an amazing country of over 300 million, that's astounding.
[03:13:38.173 --> 03:13:38.653]  So yes,
[03:13:39.213 --> 03:13:46.438]  It shouldn't be easy to come to such an amazing place like the United States of America.
[03:13:46.438 --> 03:13:49.240]  So to get here legally does take some work.
[03:13:49.240 --> 03:13:57.105]  Why should people bypass that whole process and without even knowing what their intent is once they get here?
[03:13:57.105 --> 03:14:00.086]  To undermine this wonderful system?
[03:14:00.086 --> 03:14:07.451]  To do bodily harm to the people that are here legally and were born here as Americans?
[03:14:07.451 --> 03:14:08.032]  Is that it?
[03:14:08.931 --> 03:14:11.172]  So it should be tough.
[03:14:11.172 --> 03:14:17.615]  But the thing they leave out on a day without immigrants is illegal.
[03:14:17.615 --> 03:14:19.116]  The word illegal.
[03:14:19.116 --> 03:14:34.522]  It is a calculated move on the part of the left and the media and whatever the hell their endgame is on this whole thing to deceive the people of this country.
[03:14:34.522 --> 03:14:36.063]  And who are they deceiving?
[03:14:36.063 --> 03:14:37.904]  Yes, the simple-minded.
[03:14:38.504 --> 03:14:57.041]  The people that will not do the research, that forget words like illegal, and think that Donald Trump wants to get rid of immigrants and immigration, when if you look at anything he's said, he's never indicated that.
[03:14:58.251 --> 03:15:07.056]  So they're having a day where immigrants, and I don't know why it's all immigrants, haven't they been treated just fine here?
[03:15:07.056 --> 03:15:15.601]  They've been given these amazing opportunities that this country offers when they've come from wherever they were running from?
[03:15:17.323 --> 03:15:30.853]  And they come here and now they're going to join in a protest by not showing up for work or to purchase things on this day without immigrants.
[03:15:30.853 --> 03:15:33.395]  To support what?
[03:15:33.395 --> 03:15:36.517]  Breaking the law.
[03:15:36.517 --> 03:15:39.819]  You are supporting a crime.
[03:15:39.819 --> 03:15:44.823]  To come here, to cross into the United States, over the borders,
[03:15:45.683 --> 03:15:59.922]  Without permission, and without documentation, even to visit without documentation, or to live here completely illegally, as an illegal alien, is a crime!
[03:15:59.922 --> 03:16:01.263]  It's a crime!
[03:16:02.987 --> 03:16:14.695]  Why don't we have people stay home to support a bank robbery, which I love calling undocumented withdrawal.
[03:16:14.695 --> 03:16:17.797]  It's an undocumented bank transaction.
[03:16:17.797 --> 03:16:19.058]  That's all I did.
[03:16:19.058 --> 03:16:22.221]  I wasn't robbing the bank when I took that money.
[03:16:23.061 --> 03:16:31.085]  I was making a withdrawal just without the proper documentation that it would have taken to withdraw that cash.
[03:16:31.085 --> 03:16:43.030]  So when you're protesting the fact that illegal aliens are not just being allowed to cross the borders and stay in this amazing nation of ours.
[03:16:43.933 --> 03:16:46.034]  You're supporting crime.
[03:16:46.034 --> 03:16:47.935]  Why would you do that?
[03:16:47.935 --> 03:16:50.616]  Why on earth would you do that?
[03:16:50.616 --> 03:16:51.836]  I'll tell you why.
[03:16:51.836 --> 03:16:56.638]  Because you're stupid, and you're being misled by the media.
[03:16:56.638 --> 03:16:58.579]  And you're just falling for it.
[03:16:58.579 --> 03:17:03.981]  Because they insist on leaving out a key word.
[03:17:03.981 --> 03:17:05.602]  Illegal.
[03:17:05.602 --> 03:17:06.102]  That's it.
[03:17:06.102 --> 03:17:07.743]  Why would they leave it out?
[03:17:07.743 --> 03:17:11.945]  Why would you leave out the most important word?
[03:17:13.189 --> 03:17:21.491]  In immigration, illegal immigration and immigration are on opposite ends of the spectrum.
[03:17:21.491 --> 03:17:26.692]  I'm astounded there isn't more outrage at the media because of this.
[03:17:26.692 --> 03:17:29.393]  They're lying to you.
[03:17:29.393 --> 03:17:36.934]  And I love, oh man, do I love watching Donald Trump toy with these media stars.
[03:17:40.985 --> 03:17:55.438]  Started out, I gather, they were supposed to be our eyes and ears, the media, keeping tabs on the government and what have you, giving us the information we need to be an informed populace of this country.
[03:17:55.438 --> 03:18:08.409]  Now they've turned into prima donnas and pseudo-celebrities that get so upset when they are called to task
[03:18:09.448 --> 03:18:12.311]  Because they are part of the elite now.
[03:18:12.311 --> 03:18:20.400]  When Donald Trump stands at that podium, as we saw earlier, and lambasts them for lying.
[03:18:21.588 --> 03:18:21.968]  I think?
[03:18:41.104 --> 03:18:45.809]  For the garbage they have been pumping out for decades, by the way.
[03:18:45.809 --> 03:18:55.700]  Not just for the year and a half that Donald Trump was running the campaign, his campaign, and in the time he's become president.
[03:18:55.700 --> 03:18:59.684]  They have been feeding us garbage for decades.
[03:19:00.717 --> 03:19:02.399]  For an agenda.
[03:19:02.399 --> 03:19:05.802]  For their leftist agenda.
[03:19:05.802 --> 03:19:13.710]  And to see an elected official like Donald Trump, the President of the United States now, call them to task on it.
[03:19:13.710 --> 03:19:14.731]  Toy with them!
[03:19:17.110 --> 03:19:20.994]  Watch them get so upset that they're not getting picked.
[03:19:20.994 --> 03:19:26.020]  Remember the kid in school that knew all the answers and would raise his hand?
[03:19:26.020 --> 03:19:26.160]  Oh!
[03:19:26.160 --> 03:19:27.862]  Oh, pick me!
[03:19:27.862 --> 03:19:31.706]  I want to look so smart in front of my class!
[03:19:31.706 --> 03:19:34.849]  And how upset they got when the teacher wouldn't pick them.
[03:19:34.849 --> 03:19:35.990]  And they went, oh!
[03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.791]  Oh, me too!
[03:19:36.791 --> 03:19:37.412]  No!
[03:19:39.093 --> 03:19:41.555]  Oh, they'd get all upset.

[03:19:44.176 --> 03:19:52.581]  Like the children that them and the people that buy their garbage are on a daily basis.
[03:19:52.581 --> 03:19:53.962]  Like children.

[03:22:58.579 --> 03:23:04.201]  This is the story of the shaving company called Harry's, in an epic battle of David versus Goliath.
[03:23:04.201 --> 03:23:06.582]  In the early 1980s, a child was born.
[03:23:06.582 --> 03:23:07.522]  Two of them, actually.
[03:23:07.522 --> 03:23:09.583]  Their names were Jeff and Andy.
[03:23:09.583 --> 03:23:13.964]  Time went by, they developed facial hair, and one day, something happened.
[03:23:13.964 --> 03:23:16.085]  Andy got ripped off buying overpriced razors.
[03:23:16.585 --> 03:23:20.548]  So they decided to start their own shaving company and fix shaving once and for all.
[03:23:20.548 --> 03:23:29.494]  They hired the best designers, they bought a 95-year-old German blade factory, and they started selling high-quality razors online with no upcharging direct to customers.
[03:23:29.494 --> 03:23:31.856]  How did the overpriced razor company respond?
[03:23:31.856 --> 03:23:33.377]  By threatening to sue their pants off.
[03:23:33.917 --> 03:23:34.698]  Don't worry.
[03:23:34.698 --> 03:23:40.263]  Jeff and Andy have plenty of pants and a relentless dream to give all guys a great shave at a great price.
[03:23:40.263 --> 03:23:41.644]  Try Harry's free.
[03:23:41.644 --> 03:23:47.329]  They'll send you a razor with five German blades, foaming shave gel, and even a travel blade cover when you sign up.

[03:24:10.815 --> 03:24:13.456]  Introducing Caveman!
[03:24:13.456 --> 03:24:17.858]  The ultimate new paleo formulation by Infowars Life.
[03:24:17.858 --> 03:24:27.683]  Our modern societies lost virtually all of the ancient traditions and practices that our ancestors so greatly valued for thousands of years.
[03:24:27.683 --> 03:24:35.887]  One such practice goes all the way back to the dawn of man, cooking meat over fire and simmering down the bones into a broth.
[03:24:35.887 --> 03:24:37.868]  Today we call it Bone Broth!
[03:24:38.388 --> 03:24:46.254]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[03:24:46.254 --> 03:24:53.900]  Introducing Caveman by Infowars Life, the ultimate in true paleonutrition with bone broth!
[03:24:53.900 --> 03:24:54.721]  What is that?
[03:24:54.721 --> 03:24:56.562]  Turmeric root?
[03:24:58.483 --> 03:25:04.807]  Shaga mushroom and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[03:25:04.807 --> 03:25:16.312]  The unique formulation behind Caveman combines cutting-edge nutraceutical science and ancient nutrition to increase potency and maximize benefits.
[03:25:16.312 --> 03:25:23.356]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue with the active compounds in turmeric
[03:25:24.605 --> 03:25:25.426]  They do battle!
[03:25:25.426 --> 03:25:28.388]  They do battle on a cellular level!
[03:25:28.388 --> 03:25:30.369]  I'm talking cellular!
[03:25:30.369 --> 03:25:33.492]  And help fight free radicals.
[03:25:33.492 --> 03:25:38.856]  Collagen works to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[03:25:38.856 --> 03:25:45.801]  These are just a few of the superfood ingredients found in the new Caveman True Paleo Formula.

[03:26:00.511 --> 03:26:01.851]  Oh yeah!
[03:26:01.851 --> 03:26:04.313]  Caveman!
[03:26:04.313 --> 03:26:08.576]  Ladies and gentlemen, of course we are celebrating today.
[03:26:08.576 --> 03:26:13.419]  We're celebrating the day without immigrants.
[03:26:13.419 --> 03:26:17.261]  I'll tell you what, I live in New York City.
[03:26:17.261 --> 03:26:18.462]  I'm out of New York City.
[03:26:19.282 --> 03:26:26.027]  And one of the most liberal garbage pails you could live in.
[03:26:26.027 --> 03:26:27.027]  I hate it.
[03:26:27.027 --> 03:26:29.769]  I can't wait till I could retire and move somewhere.
[03:26:29.769 --> 03:26:33.392]  Maybe I'll be Alex Jones' neighbor or something.
[03:26:33.392 --> 03:26:40.816]  Move down there to Texas, where I could exercise a lot of the rights that I cannot exercise here in New York.
[03:26:40.816 --> 03:26:42.738]  The good old Second Amendment?
[03:26:42.738 --> 03:26:45.039]  It's gone here in New York.
[03:26:45.039 --> 03:26:45.439]  Gone.
[03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:52.984]  But I live here, so you would think there would be a lot of people sympathetic to the day without immigrants.
[03:26:52.984 --> 03:26:58.327]  I took what they call the Long Island Railroad in today.
[03:26:58.327 --> 03:26:59.668]  It was beautiful.
[03:26:59.668 --> 03:27:02.309]  It wasn't that crowded.
[03:27:02.309 --> 03:27:05.151]  I didn't have to listen to people yelling on cell phones.
[03:27:06.397 --> 03:27:09.458]  Just a mile a minute, not shutting up.
[03:27:09.458 --> 03:27:10.739]  It was fantastic.
[03:27:10.739 --> 03:27:23.623]  I get into Penn Station, one of the most crowded hubs of transportation in the country, and all the stores are open.
[03:27:23.623 --> 03:27:28.245]  I saw the Starbucks and all the other places, workers in there.
[03:27:28.245 --> 03:27:33.527]  So, I don't know, this was supposed to, and here's a quote from organizers,
[03:27:34.594 --> 03:27:38.617]  Without us, your country is paralyzed!
[03:27:38.617 --> 03:27:39.919]  Paralyzed!
[03:27:39.919 --> 03:27:46.164]  Any time a group does this, we're not coming out to play day, which is pretty much it.
[03:27:46.164 --> 03:27:46.885]  You want to come out?
[03:27:46.885 --> 03:27:49.967]  No, I'm staying inside today!
[03:27:49.967 --> 03:27:55.472]  You're not going to have the enjoyment of having me out there!
[03:27:55.472 --> 03:27:57.754]  Again, very childlike, of course.
[03:28:00.100 --> 03:28:03.343]  They said here's what they wanted to do.
[03:28:03.343 --> 03:28:05.606]  Don't attend work.
[03:28:05.606 --> 03:28:08.128]  Don't open up your business.
[03:28:08.128 --> 03:28:10.771]  Do not shop online or in stores.
[03:28:10.771 --> 03:28:13.433]  Don't even do that.
[03:28:13.433 --> 03:28:14.654]  Don't eat at restaurants.
[03:28:14.654 --> 03:28:16.396]  Don't buy gas.
[03:28:16.396 --> 03:28:17.878]  Don't buy gasoline.
[03:28:17.878 --> 03:28:22.122]  Just sit in your car till tomorrow if you run out of gas.
[03:28:22.122 --> 03:28:23.623]  Do not attend class.
[03:28:24.304 --> 03:28:25.325]  That's good.
[03:28:25.325 --> 03:28:27.246]  That's a good thing to do.
[03:28:27.246 --> 03:28:28.367]  Don't go to school.
[03:28:28.367 --> 03:28:29.487]  Skip school.
[03:28:29.487 --> 03:28:33.890]  And don't send your children to school.
[03:28:33.890 --> 03:28:36.231]  First of all, this just sounds like a day.
[03:28:36.231 --> 03:28:44.576]  This sounds like any day in the ranks of illegal immigrants that could possibly be on the government till.
[03:28:44.576 --> 03:28:48.339]  That does just sound like, no school, no work.
[03:28:48.339 --> 03:28:49.419]  Don't buy gas.
[03:28:49.419 --> 03:28:51.781]  Doesn't mean you can't siphon it out of someone's tank, though.
[03:28:52.882 --> 03:28:55.586]  Hey, you never know!
[03:28:55.586 --> 03:28:57.308]  I'm just giving them options.
[03:28:57.308 --> 03:28:58.169]  That's all.
[03:28:58.169 --> 03:29:06.118]  And Donald Trump says the crackdown on illegal criminals is merely keeping of my campaign promises.
[03:29:06.118 --> 03:29:10.263]  Gang members, drug dealers, and others are being removed.
[03:29:10.263 --> 03:29:11.604]  Why is that a problem?
[03:29:13.727 --> 03:29:14.527]  I don't know.
[03:29:14.527 --> 03:29:27.758]  I love asking Alex about these things, what the endgame is, because he knows how to delve in and find out what the motives are here, because it just seems so absolutely insane that people want this.
[03:29:27.758 --> 03:29:30.060]  It's beyond Orwellian.
[03:29:30.060 --> 03:29:35.845]  It's beyond anything George Orwell could have possibly thought of when he wrote 1984, way back when.
[03:29:39.428 --> 03:29:40.710]  Gonna take a quick break.
[03:29:40.710 --> 03:29:42.451]  We'll be back in moments.
[03:29:42.451 --> 03:29:43.232]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:29:43.232 --> 03:29:49.257]  InfoWars.com.
[03:29:49.257 --> 03:29:50.678]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.678 --> 03:29:53.200]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.200 --> 03:29:55.903]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.310 --> 03:30:07.777]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.

[03:31:00.680 --> 03:31:06.887]  Bob Eubanks, you know as part of Hollywood for a long time I've seen my fair share of celebrities get in trouble with the IRS.
[03:31:06.887 --> 03:31:10.731]  Well there's one name I trust, the Tax Defense Group.
[03:31:10.731 --> 03:31:13.294]  They're the most trusted name in tax.

[03:31:19.941 --> 03:31:22.723]  Ignoring the IRS is not the solution.
[03:31:22.723 --> 03:31:27.167]  They can garnish your paycheck, levy your bank accounts, seize your home or business.
[03:31:27.167 --> 03:31:35.434]  But the Tax Defense Group could put a stop to all of that and tailor a program that would reduce your tax debt to pennies on the dollar.

[03:32:58.025 --> 03:32:58.786]  Effective.
[03:33:11.652 --> 03:33:19.858]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:28.314 --> 03:33:29.255]  Yes, indeed.
[03:33:29.255 --> 03:33:35.779]  The Alex Jones Show, Anthony Cumia, in for InfoWars.com.
[03:33:35.779 --> 03:33:45.406]  One of my favorite things to do on a daily basis is see what the celebrities are saying.
[03:33:45.406 --> 03:33:48.828]  Oh, the celebrities of this country!
[03:33:48.828 --> 03:33:56.793]  Just the knowledge that oozes from these people is astounding.
[03:33:59.475 --> 03:34:05.657]  The obese Michael Moore is always a great one to check out.
[03:34:05.657 --> 03:34:12.560]  His thinking transcends anything with any reason or logic.
[03:34:12.560 --> 03:34:18.023]  He's a blithering idiot.
[03:34:18.023 --> 03:34:25.046]  These celebrities now are blatantly calling for an overthrow of the United States government.
[03:34:25.959 --> 03:34:50.417]  This from a bunch of people that were saying, oh boy, when they thought, when they thought, when they knew Hillary Clinton was going to sweep this election and be the president, they were sure that Donald Trump and his supporters would not accept the results of the election and would riot
[03:34:51.945 --> 03:34:59.607]  And throw roadblocks in Hillary, President Hillary Clinton's way so she could not accomplish anything.
[03:34:59.607 --> 03:35:12.029]  And if Trump wouldn't accept the results, it was un-American and a blow to our own democracy and blah, blah, blah.
[03:35:12.029 --> 03:35:14.090]  They went on and on about this.
[03:35:15.322 --> 03:35:17.603]  Because they were positive.
[03:35:17.603 --> 03:35:22.265]  Because of, again, the lying media, they were positive Hillary was going to win.
[03:35:22.265 --> 03:35:25.367]  Well, we all know how that ended up, didn't we?
[03:35:25.367 --> 03:35:28.248]  Donald Trump is the President of the United States.
[03:35:28.248 --> 03:35:33.910]  And what has the left and the celebrities and the Democrats and the press, what have they done?
[03:35:33.910 --> 03:35:37.052]  Nonstop crying.
[03:35:37.052 --> 03:35:38.552]  Nonstop.
[03:35:38.552 --> 03:35:41.154]  And to the people that aren't in that group,
[03:35:42.895 --> 03:35:44.255]  They understand.
[03:35:44.255 --> 03:35:52.021]  It's like being seated, you're on a flight to Australia and you're seated next to crying babies.
[03:35:52.021 --> 03:35:53.241]  Imagine that.
[03:35:53.241 --> 03:36:03.148]  That's how we feel when we have to hear this crap coming out of the left and the media and of course the celebrities.
[03:36:03.148 --> 03:36:04.949]  Hollywood.
[03:36:04.949 --> 03:36:07.030]  Michael Moore is
[03:36:08.965 --> 03:36:14.113]  Saying that Donald Trump has to remove himself from office.
[03:36:14.113 --> 03:36:16.095]  Has to remove himself from office!
[03:36:16.874 --> 03:36:24.078]  Because of all these allegations of communications with Russia.
[03:36:24.078 --> 03:36:26.660]  Russia is the thing.
[03:36:26.660 --> 03:36:28.561]  Russia's the big problem.
[03:36:28.561 --> 03:36:31.803]  They have influenced everything we've done here.
[03:36:31.803 --> 03:36:41.409]  The election, they're the ones that have leaked all that information about the Democrats, the DNC, Hillary Clinton, like everybody.
[03:36:43.032 --> 03:36:50.580]  And so now if you follow the chain of events, here's something that the left hates to do.
[03:36:50.580 --> 03:36:51.681]  Work it through.
[03:36:51.681 --> 03:36:52.822]  That's the thing.
[03:36:52.822 --> 03:36:54.464]  Work it through.
[03:36:54.464 --> 03:36:58.988]  See, alright, if that step goes, now what happens next and next?
[03:36:58.988 --> 03:37:03.513]  Work the whole thing through until you come to your solution.
[03:37:05.808 --> 03:37:11.631]  Mike Pence, the Vice President, would become the President of the United States.
[03:37:11.631 --> 03:37:21.617]  You might remember a little episode called Watergate, where Richard Milhouse Nixon had to resign his presidency.
[03:37:21.617 --> 03:37:24.699]  Well, Gerald Ford was Vice President at the time.
[03:37:24.699 --> 03:37:26.020]  He becomes President!
[03:37:27.575 --> 03:37:30.457]  Not in Michael Moore's world!
[03:37:30.457 --> 03:37:32.638]  That's still bad.
[03:37:32.638 --> 03:37:35.400]  They don't like Mike Pence.
[03:37:35.400 --> 03:37:48.768]  So Pence, according to Michael Moore, cannot be president because he was elected under the same fraud and treason as Donald Trump was.
[03:37:48.768 --> 03:37:50.049]  So here's his suggestion.
[03:37:51.104 --> 03:37:54.406]  And I don't know where he pulled this out of.
[03:37:54.406 --> 03:38:02.492]  Although he's got ample room in that behind, maybe that's where he got this from.
[03:38:02.492 --> 03:38:15.522]  The Supreme Court has to decide based on, yes, the winner of the popular vote, who of course was Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[03:38:16.664 --> 03:38:20.050]  Uh, if you believe, um, that she won the popular vote.
[03:38:20.050 --> 03:38:25.739]  Because, uh, according to, uh, the left of the media, Democrats, Michael Moore, celebrities, um...
[03:38:26.949 --> 03:38:31.273]  They have no doubt that no improprieties happened during the election.
[03:38:31.273 --> 03:38:34.275]  No illegals voted.
[03:38:34.275 --> 03:38:44.004]  Even though the president himself went on television and said, hey, if you're illegal, you got illegals in your family or whatever, you go vote.
[03:38:44.004 --> 03:38:45.765]  Don't you sweat it.
[03:38:45.765 --> 03:38:47.847]  No one's going to come after you.
[03:38:47.847 --> 03:38:48.468]  I remember that.
[03:38:48.468 --> 03:38:49.569]  I remember that spot.
[03:38:51.229 --> 03:38:59.255]  So he thinks that could be done, and if worse comes to worse, and that can't be done, a whole new election.
[03:38:59.255 --> 03:39:02.297]  Just a whole new election.
[03:39:02.297 --> 03:39:12.464]  This is trying to overthrow a legally elected president of the United States.
[03:39:12.464 --> 03:39:13.885]  They keep doing this.
[03:39:13.885 --> 03:39:14.386]  Who's that?
[03:39:14.386 --> 03:39:15.446]  Sally Cohen?
[03:39:15.446 --> 03:39:16.567]  Is that that one that's on?
[03:39:17.808 --> 03:39:19.569]  MSNBC or something?
[03:39:19.569 --> 03:39:29.432]  Another one of these androgynous... I can check eight different sexualities on whatever form I'm... I'm filling out.
[03:39:29.432 --> 03:39:30.813]  Women.
[03:39:30.813 --> 03:39:31.853]  Allegedly.
[03:39:31.853 --> 03:39:33.654]  Can I say alleged woman?
[03:39:33.654 --> 03:39:35.414]  An alleged woman.
[03:39:35.414 --> 03:39:38.535]  Sally Kahn or Kohn.
[03:39:38.535 --> 03:39:45.618]  She had a whole list that she tweeted out about removing the President of the United States.
[03:39:47.318 --> 03:39:53.872]  And putting somehow, I don't know how they get this that Hillary Clinton ends up in office.
[03:39:53.872 --> 03:39:55.375]  I really don't understand that.
[03:39:56.807 --> 03:40:04.671]  I actually thought I saw Bill and Hillary on the mid-season premiere of The Walking Dead.
[03:40:04.671 --> 03:40:06.012]  I was just watching that.
[03:40:06.012 --> 03:40:12.776]  I swear I thought I saw Bill take a crossbow bolt to the head, and I think Hillary's head got cut off.
[03:40:12.776 --> 03:40:17.859]  Because they were walking toward Rick.
[03:40:17.859 --> 03:40:19.420]  I think.
[03:40:19.420 --> 03:40:23.082]  Would you stop with the Clintons already?
[03:40:23.082 --> 03:40:25.143]  Your ideas are ludicrous!
[03:40:27.477 --> 03:40:29.158]  At any level.
[03:40:29.158 --> 03:40:40.967]  But the second I look at the end of your list, and Hillary Rodham Clinton is a president again, or a president, you're out of your minds.
[03:40:40.967 --> 03:40:42.568]  You're crazy enough.
[03:40:42.568 --> 03:40:45.170]  But that's real craziness.
[03:40:45.170 --> 03:40:47.492]  So, knock that off.
[03:40:47.492 --> 03:40:54.337]  And then we have the Sarah Silverman's and Judd Apatow, who I adore reading their tweets.
[03:40:54.337 --> 03:40:55.277]  If you want a little
[03:40:57.000 --> 03:41:07.327]  Sometimes I like seeing what works better, my Tums or my Tagamet for Ajita and indigestion.
[03:41:07.327 --> 03:41:21.636]  So I'll eat something and then I'll read Judd Apatow's tweets and Sarah Silverman's tweets and then I'll take some and see which works better to get my raging indigestion and Ajita out of the way.
[03:41:22.777 --> 03:41:25.279]  Because they're infuriating.
[03:41:25.279 --> 03:41:34.904]  Again, calling for the expulsion of Donald Trump, our president.
[03:41:34.904 --> 03:41:37.546]  Regardless of how you feel about it.
[03:41:37.546 --> 03:41:38.106]  I don't know.
[03:41:38.106 --> 03:41:39.467]  Madonna's another one.
[03:41:39.467 --> 03:41:42.789]  Bette Midler.
[03:41:42.789 --> 03:41:43.209]  Cher.
[03:41:44.935 --> 03:41:57.700]  These are the people that are speaking to the general population, the serfs, the peasants.
[03:41:57.700 --> 03:42:04.023]  They're the ones in the know that have the experience of working for a living.
[03:42:05.199 --> 03:42:09.205]  Look, I adore the job I have in broadcasting these days.
[03:42:09.205 --> 03:42:16.395]  But truth be told, until I was in my mid-30s, I was in construction.
[03:42:16.395 --> 03:42:18.719]  I worked construction.
[03:42:18.719 --> 03:42:20.181]  And it was tough.
[03:42:20.181 --> 03:42:21.262]  It was a real job.
[03:42:21.883 --> 03:42:37.817]  Where you worked, you were tired when you were done, you made lousy money doing it, and then you tried to figure out how to work paycheck to paycheck and pay your bills and be a contributing member of society.
[03:42:37.817 --> 03:42:44.463]  Well, I guess Madonna can tell us how that's done.
[03:42:44.463 --> 03:42:45.865]  She could tell us what that's like.
[03:42:47.133 --> 03:42:55.978]  As she was rolling around on the floor in a wedding dress when she was the age most people are starting their first jobs.
[03:42:55.978 --> 03:43:00.040]  Why are people giving them any credence?
[03:43:00.040 --> 03:43:09.685]  And the media loves spilling what they're saying because it fits, again, their crappy BS agenda that they're following.
[03:43:10.615 --> 03:43:11.556]  The endgame?
[03:43:11.556 --> 03:43:13.157]  I'm starting to figure it out.
[03:43:13.157 --> 03:43:14.517]  I listen to Alex.
[03:43:14.517 --> 03:43:18.780]  I go to some of the alternative news sources.
[03:43:18.780 --> 03:43:22.042]  They love being in charge.
[03:43:22.042 --> 03:43:26.165]  And look, who can fault somebody for wanting to be in charge?
[03:43:28.226 --> 03:43:39.853]  The left has been in charge for quite a few years, and if you look at the Bush presidency as compared to what Trump wants to do, he might as well have been a Democrat also.
[03:43:39.853 --> 03:43:42.035]  I mean, just another politician.
[03:43:42.035 --> 03:43:43.055]  We've been so...
[03:43:44.198 --> 03:43:52.850]  Conditioned to think that the political parties are Republican and Democrat and they have these vast ideological differences?
[03:43:52.850 --> 03:43:55.073]  No, no, no, no, no.
[03:43:55.073 --> 03:43:58.497]  Trump is showing everybody that they are all the same.
[03:43:59.278 --> 03:44:17.198]  And when you see some of these Republicans coming out against some of the policies Trump wants to put in place, like a strong military, strong borders, jobs back here in this country, national pride, something as simple as something... Remember when Ronald Reagan brought national pride back to this country?
[03:44:18.939 --> 03:44:24.563]  These are some of the things that even some Republicans are scoffing at.
[03:44:24.563 --> 03:44:27.024]  And then you realize, oh, okay.
[03:44:27.024 --> 03:44:36.030]  The politicians in this country have always been about power, staying in power, and ruling the people.
[03:44:36.030 --> 03:44:38.671]  Don't work for us, just stop.
[03:44:38.671 --> 03:44:42.534]  The second you think the government works for you, try cutting down a tree in your yard.
[03:44:43.396 --> 03:44:50.621]  And going through it legally, where you have to get permits, and inspectors, and you're paying people, and then think about it.
[03:44:50.621 --> 03:44:53.483]  Go, um, they work for us.
[03:44:53.483 --> 03:44:56.425]  Who is the us that wanted this?
[03:44:56.425 --> 03:45:05.692]  Did my neighbor go to his politician and go, yeah, I want to pay you a bunch of money when I want to cut a tree down in my yard?
[03:45:05.692 --> 03:45:12.117]  When you think they're working for you, try going out and shooting a rabbit for dinner.
[03:45:12.895 --> 03:45:14.216]  Just go out.
[03:45:14.216 --> 03:45:16.917]  You see a rabbit in the bushes in your house?
[03:45:16.917 --> 03:45:18.238]  Go shoot it.
[03:45:18.238 --> 03:45:22.200]  Shoot it, bring it in your house, skin it, cook it, and feed it to your family.
[03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:23.501]  Woo!
[03:45:23.501 --> 03:45:25.122]  Woo!
[03:45:25.122 --> 03:45:25.702]  Police!
[03:45:25.702 --> 03:45:27.243]  Open the door!
[03:45:27.243 --> 03:45:28.423]  What happened?
[03:45:28.423 --> 03:45:29.844]  Well, you shot a rabbit.
[03:45:29.844 --> 03:45:31.685]  It was in my yard.
[03:45:31.685 --> 03:45:33.526]  I'm feeding my family.
[03:45:33.526 --> 03:45:34.507]  Put your hands behind your back.
[03:45:34.507 --> 03:45:35.087]  You're under arrest.
[03:45:37.750 --> 03:45:42.533]  Who said I can't provide for my family on my own property?
[03:45:42.533 --> 03:45:45.355]  Discharge of firearms in city limits prohibited.
[03:45:45.355 --> 03:45:47.897]  Who said that?
[03:45:47.897 --> 03:45:48.558]  Oh, you did.
[03:45:48.558 --> 03:45:49.579]  You're working for me.
[03:45:49.579 --> 03:45:51.220]  But I don't want that.
[03:45:51.220 --> 03:45:54.002]  So they're not working for you.
[03:45:54.002 --> 03:45:55.743]  It's a great idea.
[03:45:55.743 --> 03:45:58.585]  It's so idealistic.
[03:46:00.398 --> 03:46:02.341]  They're not working for you.
[03:46:02.341 --> 03:46:03.704]  You are ruled by them.
[03:46:03.704 --> 03:46:10.414]  And our job is to keep their power base at a minimum.
[03:46:10.414 --> 03:46:14.160]  Their job is to regulate every single thing you do.
[03:46:15.293 --> 03:46:21.602]  And Donald Trump comes in and oh my god, talk about upsetting an apple cart on both sides.
[03:46:21.602 --> 03:46:25.286]  Because Republicans and Democrats just want to rule you.
[03:46:25.286 --> 03:46:32.796]  So he comes in with these ideas going, let's give power back to the people, let's bring jobs back, let's bring individuality back.
[03:46:33.277 --> 03:46:40.040]  We're not this giant group that fits on this globe with other groups that interlock like puzzle pieces.
[03:46:40.040 --> 03:46:41.520]  We are unique!
[03:46:41.520 --> 03:46:51.544]  I'm proud to be unique and be an American because this was supposed to be about liberty and freedoms for individuals.
[03:46:51.544 --> 03:46:53.785]  You as a country, the government,
[03:46:54.964 --> 03:47:06.007]  As the United States government is supposed to do nothing but give us the opportunities and guarantee us the rights that we have as Americans.
[03:47:06.007 --> 03:47:17.410]  Not tell me I can't cut a tree down in my yard without paying 15 different people to do it and getting variances and filling out things because I don't know one of my neighbors
[03:47:17.990 --> 03:47:23.734]  That went to one politician and asked to please put that in place.
[03:47:23.734 --> 03:47:26.295]  So we have to do those things.
[03:47:26.295 --> 03:47:33.920]  So you get a guy at the top of the heap, the top of the pyramid, Donald Trump, President of the United States.
[03:47:33.920 --> 03:47:36.962]  And he's a guy that believes like Americans believe.
[03:47:36.962 --> 03:47:38.583]  I want more freedom.
[03:47:38.583 --> 03:47:39.764]  I don't want regulation.
[03:47:39.764 --> 03:47:40.584]  I want people
[03:47:41.638 --> 03:47:46.619]  To be able to do as they please within the laws.
[03:47:46.619 --> 03:47:54.341]  And I'm talking your basic laws that most people could understand, not regulations.
[03:47:54.341 --> 03:48:02.382]  And he's upsetting a lot of people, because their whole job is to have you firmly pressed under their thumb.
[03:48:02.382 --> 03:48:10.404]  And they've been doing this balancing act for a while, where they make you believe you have all these freedoms, and then
[03:48:11.741 --> 03:48:13.282]  They rule you.
[03:48:13.282 --> 03:48:14.802]  It's a deception.
[03:48:14.802 --> 03:48:21.224]  And with Trump in office, it has not been as easy for them to deceive us.
[03:48:21.224 --> 03:48:28.247]  Because the press has been exposed as a bunch of lying sacks, which they are.
[03:48:28.247 --> 03:48:33.089]  And politicians have been exposed as people who just want to rule you.
[03:48:33.089 --> 03:48:35.950]  It's a dangerous, dangerous place.
[03:48:35.950 --> 03:48:39.731]  Whenever a politician tries something truly revolutionary,
[03:48:41.923 --> 03:48:44.025]  It does not end well.
[03:48:44.025 --> 03:48:49.628]  I really do fear for the president's safety.
[03:48:49.628 --> 03:48:53.271]  You talk about the leaks going on in the White House.
[03:48:53.271 --> 03:49:06.360]  A lot of information that is supposed to be kept secret is oozing out of the White House and making its way to the media to use as a weapon against the administration.
[03:49:06.360 --> 03:49:08.962]  You think that only goes with
[03:49:10.026 --> 03:49:19.033]  His employees at the White House, or we're hearing now from the intelligence community, that have issues with Donald Trump leaking information out.
[03:49:19.033 --> 03:49:23.076]  You don't think maybe it could go to the Secret Service?
[03:49:23.076 --> 03:49:25.558]  Maybe it could go to other various organizations?
[03:49:25.558 --> 03:49:37.747]  When you have a media out there that is putting Donald Trump in the same light as Hitler, you don't think there's nuts out there that have this hero complex?
[03:49:39.409 --> 03:49:50.976]  Imagine, wow, if I could have killed Hitler before he started World War II, I could have been the savior of the world.
[03:49:50.976 --> 03:50:01.282]  You don't think there are nuts out there that if you keep pumping up the idea that Hitler is this evil man who is going to cause horrific
[03:50:03.123 --> 03:50:11.828]  Torture, and injury, and wars, that these nuts aren't going to bite on it?
[03:50:11.828 --> 03:50:13.129]  They're culpable!
[03:50:13.129 --> 03:50:29.579]  The media, celebrities like Michael Moore, the liberal fascist groups that we see beating people in the streets, calling people Nazis, you don't think they're impressionable?
[03:50:29.579 --> 03:50:31.020]  They're mentally ill!
[03:50:32.062 --> 03:50:33.603]  Take a look at them!
[03:50:33.603 --> 03:50:34.684]  Take a look at them on TV!
[03:50:34.684 --> 03:50:37.226]  They're mentally ill!
[03:50:37.226 --> 03:50:40.848]  And they will eat this stuff up!
[03:50:40.848 --> 03:50:47.834]  And mark my words, in the four years of a Donald Trump presidency, someone's gonna take a pot shot at this guy.
[03:50:47.834 --> 03:50:51.656]  Someone's gonna take a shot at him, and they'll all be culpable.
[03:50:51.656 --> 03:50:53.618]  We'll be back in a couple of minutes.
[03:50:53.618 --> 03:50:54.779]  Do not go anywhere.
[03:50:54.779 --> 03:50:57.261]  Anthony Cumia, in for InfoWars.com.

[03:52:59.813 --> 03:53:10.662]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[03:53:10.662 --> 03:53:14.825]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.

[03:53:22.571 --> 03:53:32.575]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.

[03:54:09.187 --> 03:54:12.150]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[03:54:12.150 --> 03:54:16.554]  It's back in stock after being sold out for months at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:54:16.554 --> 03:54:25.202]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is now back in stores at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:25.202 --> 03:54:27.324]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:54:27.324 --> 03:54:34.571]  Research across the board indicates that the health of your gums can contribute to the development of heart disease and heart attacks.
[03:54:35.071 --> 03:54:41.395]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter the bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:54:41.395 --> 03:54:43.396]  My God, brush your teeth!
[03:54:43.396 --> 03:54:50.980]  This is why the latest Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:54:50.980 --> 03:54:54.242]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is groundbreaking.
[03:54:54.242 --> 03:55:01.826]  A new formula that's loaded with the good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:55:02.386 --> 03:55:03.567]  That's a big difference there.
[03:55:03.567 --> 03:55:13.352]  Super Blue contains natural oils and natural ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:55:13.352 --> 03:55:18.014]  Man, you didn't want that like Jesus coming up to you with bad breath, right?
[03:55:18.014 --> 03:55:31.121]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts and formulation scientists include, uh-oh and here we go, xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano-silver,
[03:55:32.748 --> 03:55:42.796]  And due to the request of listeners, we've also created a new bubblegum-flavored Super Blue that's spirit-free and great for children.
[03:55:42.796 --> 03:55:44.037]  Get it for the kids.
[03:55:44.037 --> 03:55:44.918]  Brush their teeth.

[03:55:55.566 --> 03:55:57.228]  Brush your teeth.
[03:55:57.228 --> 03:55:58.429]  Get in there, brush your teeth.
[03:56:03.274 --> 03:56:04.534]  Canada.
[03:56:04.534 --> 03:56:05.535]  I love this story.
[03:56:05.535 --> 03:56:06.435]  This is a good one.
[03:56:06.435 --> 03:56:12.377]  I guess a Somali man crossed into Canada and just met up with a reporter.
[03:56:12.377 --> 03:56:15.958]  Oh, this couldn't have possibly have been staged or anything.
[03:56:15.958 --> 03:56:23.100]  A Somali guy was fleeing the United States of America because of Donald Trump.
[03:56:24.400 --> 03:56:30.701]  And braving the freezing temperatures of Manitoba, Canada.
[03:56:30.701 --> 03:56:31.461]  There he is.
[03:56:31.461 --> 03:56:34.002]  The reporter was just walking around.
[03:56:34.002 --> 03:56:36.222]  Just walking around!
[03:56:36.222 --> 03:56:41.223]  And he finds a refugee sitting in the snow.
[03:56:41.223 --> 03:56:44.724]  What kind of crap are they trying to sell us?
[03:56:44.724 --> 03:56:47.144]  Mohammed, nice to meet you.
[03:56:47.144 --> 03:56:48.165]  Did you just cross?
[03:56:48.165 --> 03:56:49.905]  Yeah, he just crossed over.
[03:56:51.432 --> 03:56:53.494]  Illegally, by the way, into Canada.
[03:56:53.494 --> 03:56:56.275]  Wouldn't that be great if they just threw him out?
[03:56:56.275 --> 03:56:57.776]  But Canada, hey, please, take him.
[03:56:57.776 --> 03:57:02.079]  And if more Somalis want to cross over into Canada, I don't have any issue with that.
[03:57:02.079 --> 03:57:02.799]  That's fine.
[03:57:02.799 --> 03:57:05.321]  But here's the problem I have.
[03:57:05.321 --> 03:57:14.627]  They're making this story like they're risking their lives going into Canada from the United States because they could freeze.
[03:57:15.558 --> 03:57:19.200]  Don't they all live in, like, Minneapolis?
[03:57:19.200 --> 03:57:24.702]  Isn't Minneapolis, Minnesota the Somali refugee capital of the United States?
[03:57:24.702 --> 03:57:30.005]  Let me let you in on something.
[03:57:30.005 --> 03:57:33.627]  It's freezing cold in Minneapolis!
[03:57:33.627 --> 03:57:41.650]  It's not like it came from the Sonora Desert and then went into the cold.
[03:57:41.650 --> 03:57:42.551]  It's freezing.
[03:57:43.994 --> 03:57:45.235]  In Minnesota.
[03:57:45.235 --> 03:57:47.118]  Everyone knows that.
[03:57:47.118 --> 03:57:56.631]  And if Somalis can just cross the border and get help, I guess the reporter took him into the vehicle and turned the heater on and he was able to hang out in there.
[03:57:56.631 --> 03:57:58.253]  And I don't know.
[03:57:58.253 --> 03:57:59.755]  Is he going to stay in Canada?
[03:58:00.512 --> 03:58:03.295]  Because Canada, have at it!
[03:58:03.295 --> 03:58:04.476]  Have fun!
[03:58:04.476 --> 03:58:07.400]  See how that works out for you.
[03:58:07.400 --> 03:58:10.082]  Our neighbours to the north, a little too lenient.
[03:58:10.082 --> 03:58:20.193]  I love the fact that we have Donald Trump here and it's scaring people to brave the freezing tundra that is our neighbours to the north.
[03:58:21.114 --> 03:58:25.538]  I want to thank again, of course, Alex Jones for having me on.
[03:58:25.538 --> 03:58:28.661]  I love doing this for Infowars.com.
[03:58:28.661 --> 03:58:36.288]  Every other Thursday, you can catch me again in two weeks or at compoundmedia.com for my daily show.
[03:58:36.288 --> 03:58:42.574]  But again, thank you and we'll see you next time.
