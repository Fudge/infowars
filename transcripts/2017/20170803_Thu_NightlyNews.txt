[00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.439]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.581]  I'm David Knight and it's Thursday, August 3rd, 2017.
[00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:23.602]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:23.823]  Tonight!
[00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:41.173]  FBI Director Robert Mueller goes on a fishing expedition to catch President Donald Trump in the act, colluding with the Russians.
[00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:48.837]  And now he has empaneled a grand jury to investigate the Russian hacking conspiracy.
[00:00:49.178 --> 00:00:52.840]  The grand jury will indict a ham sandwich if a prosecutor tells them to.
[00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:57.643]  Well, look who showed up at the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:00:58.023 --> 00:01:02.386]  Milo joins Alex Jones doing what they do best.
[00:01:02.806 --> 00:01:06.429]  Triggering liberal snowflakes nationwide.
[00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:11.972]  All that plus the deep state plot to overthrow President Donald Trump.
[00:01:12.413 --> 00:01:14.434]  Might happen sooner than you think.
[00:01:14.854 --> 00:01:18.397]  That's coming up next on the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:35.358]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:47.404]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community, is fully aware of the fact
[00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:53.667]  That our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:01:54.387 --> 00:02:02.310]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:11.815]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:18.804]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:27.317]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:32.041]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body.
[00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:34.904]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:43.532]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:49.657]  Because of you praying for the broadcast, because of you buying the products and financially supporting the transmissions.
[00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:55.582]  So please, secure your caveman today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:03:09.332 --> 00:03:11.193]  Breaking news today from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:15.554]  Special Counsel Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury.
[00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:21.256]  And as you know the expression, you can indict a ham sandwich if you really want to with a grand jury.
[00:03:21.296 --> 00:03:21.936]  Why is that?
[00:03:22.576 --> 00:03:25.017]  Because they only hear one side.
[00:03:25.777 --> 00:03:32.602]  And of course we're going to talk to somebody later in the show that's going to tell us, give us an update as to what's going on in the Bunkerville trial.
[00:03:32.642 --> 00:03:36.544]  They're only hearing one side there, but that's because of the rules of the judge.
[00:03:36.564 --> 00:03:39.566]  But that's the rules under which a grand jury operates.
[00:03:40.207 --> 00:03:46.671]  Wall Street Journal reports that this is growing in intensity, the investigation, that it is entering a new phase.
[00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:51.134]  And they said the signals of Mr. Mueller's inquiry will likely continue for months.
[00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:52.275]  Of course it will.
[00:03:52.975 --> 00:03:57.916]  Because, as Joseph Stalin himself said, bring me the man, and I'll find the crime.
[00:03:57.996 --> 00:04:00.577]  If you investigate long enough, you can dig up some dirt on somebody.
[00:04:00.637 --> 00:04:05.178]  Or the way that it works in Washington, most likely, is they will create a process crime.
[00:04:05.198 --> 00:04:12.800]  They'll keep asking somebody questions, get further and further in details, and if they can get somebody to say something or even imply that they said something,
[00:04:13.817 --> 00:04:16.218]  That they might be able to hang them on, that's what they will do.
[00:04:16.318 --> 00:04:17.759]  Get them for perjury charges.
[00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:21.481]  That's why it was very important for Hillary Clinton to watch herself.
[00:04:21.501 --> 00:04:23.782]  Remember, that was what got Bill Clinton impeached.
[00:04:24.562 --> 00:04:30.025]  Special prosecutor there never went after him for rape or sexual assault, merely went after him for a consensual affair.
[00:04:30.825 --> 00:04:36.128]  And yet Bill Clinton lied about it under oath when they questioned him because he didn't want to admit to that.
[00:04:36.648 --> 00:04:38.109]  And that's what they impeached him for.
[00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:41.190]  So that's the kind of process crime they're looking for from somebody.
[00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:46.053]  Meanwhile, top FBI officials could testify against Trump as well, reports Vox.
[00:04:46.833 --> 00:04:53.700]  FBI Director Andrew McCabe told several of the highest-ranking managers of the Bureau they should consider themselves to be possible witnesses.
[00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:55.963]  Who is this guy, Andrew McCabe?
[00:04:56.483 --> 00:05:01.469]  Well, this is somebody who is facing multiple ethical investigations himself.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:10.941]  One of them about the fact that he got $700,000, a very, very close ally of Hillary Clinton, while he was investigating Hillary Clinton's emails.
[00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:20.083]  And that would be now Governor Terry McAuliffe, the guy who has been campaign manager for the Clintons, who ran the DNC for Bill Clinton.
[00:05:20.123 --> 00:05:23.164]  He's been very connected to the Clintons then and now.
[00:05:23.184 --> 00:05:31.165]  $700,000 contribution to Andrew McCabe's wife as she was running for Senate while Andrew McCabe was investigating Hillary Clinton.
[00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:32.366]  No problem with that.
[00:05:32.786 --> 00:05:34.067]  Nothing to investigate there.
[00:05:34.087 --> 00:05:49.558]  McCabe has told colleagues that he, too, is a potential witness in the probe as to whether Trump broke the law by trying to thwart the FBI's Russian investigation, and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government to defeat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.
[00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:56.684]  Well, actually, quite frankly, the FBI is still colluding with Clinton and the Democrats to defeat Trump.
[00:05:57.404 --> 00:05:59.485]  And the rest of the establishment, the GOP as well.
[00:05:59.745 --> 00:06:03.566]  They couldn't defeat him at the ballot box, so they're going to try to defeat him after the fact.
[00:06:04.406 --> 00:06:10.027]  And as CNN reports, one year into the FBI's Russia investigation, Mueller is now on the Trump money trail.
[00:06:10.087 --> 00:06:12.788]  As I point out, they're going to expand this out now.
[00:06:12.828 --> 00:06:14.488]  He's got the grand jury that he's convened.
[00:06:14.848 --> 00:06:19.810]  Now he's going to start looking into financial dealings of Donald Trump.
[00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.391]  And of course, as many businesses as he has, and all the countries that he operates in,
[00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:28.493]  They can surely find something to allege an impropriety with this.
[00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:36.699]  Federal investigators have seized on Trump and his associates financial ties to Russia as one of the most fertile avenues for moving their probe forward.
[00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:43.204]  But the web of financial ties, they say, this is CNN, could offer a more concrete path towards potential prosecution.
[00:06:43.824 --> 00:06:46.106]  One year after the FBI opened an investigation.
[00:06:46.246 --> 00:06:46.746]  Understand that?
[00:06:47.066 --> 00:06:47.827]  One year.
[00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:49.748]  They've been looking at this for a year.
[00:06:50.188 --> 00:06:50.969]  They don't have anything.
[00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:53.391]  So let's expand the investigation.
[00:06:54.332 --> 00:06:58.414]  Let's cast the net wider in this fishing expedition.
[00:06:58.514 --> 00:06:59.915]  I'm sure we can find something somewhere.
[00:07:00.195 --> 00:07:03.277]  Let's just start digging through all of his businesses and see if we can find something.
[00:07:03.957 --> 00:07:10.200]  So sources described an investigation that is now widened to focus on possible financial crimes.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.941]  Remember how
[00:07:11.641 --> 00:07:13.021]  Deep financial crimes can be.
[00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:17.722]  Remember, they couldn't get the hand-picked Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert.
[00:07:18.162 --> 00:07:25.624]  They groomed this guy because he was a pedophile, and they put him in charge as Speaker of the House for the GOP, the longest-serving Speaker of the House for the GOP.
[00:07:25.884 --> 00:07:30.204]  They could not get him for being a pedophile, even after other people found out about it.
[00:07:30.224 --> 00:07:31.085]  Of course, they knew about it.
[00:07:31.105 --> 00:07:31.965]  That's why they put him in.
[00:07:32.305 --> 00:07:38.826]  But when the rest of the people, real people in law enforcement, found out about it, we have these things called statute of limitations for pedophiles.
[00:07:39.386 --> 00:07:40.646]  That's there for a reason, folks.
[00:07:41.206 --> 00:07:43.507]  The elite want that there so they can get away with it.
[00:07:44.187 --> 00:07:48.728]  Some people wanted to send him to jail so they came after him for financial crimes.
[00:07:49.388 --> 00:07:56.810]  Taking out his money out of his own bank account and doing it in a way to avoid detection because he'd been questioned by the bank examiners.
[00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.150]  That's the type of thing.
[00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.671]  We have this complex web of crimes that shouldn't even be crimes.
[00:08:02.731 --> 00:08:08.384]  So he was sent to jail for something that shouldn't have even been a crime, because we don't want to make a crime out of pedophilia.
[00:08:08.564 --> 00:08:10.188]  Certainly not for our elite masters.
[00:08:10.228 --> 00:08:11.311]  They can hide it long enough.
[00:08:12.014 --> 00:08:15.617]  And they can pay off the blackmailers long enough, so we don't want to let that happen.
[00:08:15.857 --> 00:08:16.778]  But that's the issue.
[00:08:17.478 --> 00:08:22.102]  Financial crimes are a very, very broad issue, especially when you have so many businesses.
[00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:40.737]  This says, along with the ongoing scrutiny of possible illegal coordinations with Russian spy agencies and alleged attempts by President Donald Trump and others to obstruct the investigation, they're not going to take a look, when they talk about obstruction, they're not going to take a look at the obstruction that goes along with crushing the servers of the DNC.
[00:08:41.795 --> 00:08:42.515]  Or taking them out.
[00:08:42.695 --> 00:08:46.377]  Or erasing all the information and doing it in a way that it can't be recovered.
[00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:47.417]  Remember with Bleach Pit.
[00:08:47.517 --> 00:08:52.980]  Or meeting on the tarmac with the Attorney General and Bill Clinton.
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.040]  Nothing to see there.
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.621]  No obstruction going there.
[00:08:56.321 --> 00:08:59.522]  Nothing criminal or illegal or suspicious whatsoever.
[00:09:00.283 --> 00:09:05.325]  Meanwhile, we have a couple of Senators who are trying to take action to make sure that Robert Mueller
[00:09:05.925 --> 00:09:07.086]  Cannot be removed.
[00:09:07.386 --> 00:09:10.648]  This is going to go on forever, folks, as I said, until he finds something.
[00:09:10.688 --> 00:09:19.212]  And of course, the person leading this on the Republican side is newly-minted Republican Senator Tom Tillis of North Carolina.
[00:09:19.252 --> 00:09:25.116]  As I've pointed out many times before, this guy was hand-picked and groomed by the establishment.
[00:09:26.036 --> 00:09:27.877]  Tom Tillis is part of the Deep State.
[00:09:27.897 --> 00:09:30.299]  He's one of the swamp creatures, even if he just got there.
[00:09:30.599 --> 00:09:32.581]  And Democrat Senator Chris Coons of Delaware.
[00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:34.722]  The plan to introduce legislation on Thursday.
[00:09:35.222 --> 00:09:45.870]  The bill would allow any special counsel for the Department of Justice to challenge his or her removal in court, with a review by a three-judge panel within 14 days of the challenge.
[00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.571]  Well, any of them, right?
[00:09:47.651 --> 00:09:51.214]  We're not looking at anybody in particular, but they specifically
[00:09:52.318 --> 00:09:59.221]  Take the bill retroactively back to the day that Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
[00:10:00.862 --> 00:10:01.883]  That's precisely what they're doing.
[00:10:01.903 --> 00:10:06.865]  They want this investigation to go on until they can find something to remove Donald Trump.
[00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:15.629]  Meanwhile, The Atlantic points out that a National Security Council staffer has been forced out over a controversial memo.
[00:10:15.689 --> 00:10:16.870]  And this is H.R.
[00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.010]  McMaster doing this.
[00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.372]  They say a top official of the National Security Council was fired last month
[00:10:21.912 --> 00:10:33.700]  Just coming out now, after arguing in a memo that President Trump is under sustained attack from subversive forces, both within and outside the government, who are deploying malice tactics to defeat President Trump's nationalist agenda.
[00:10:34.161 --> 00:10:42.487]  Well, this guy must be a conspiracy theorist, because you couldn't possibly discern that from just the headlines in mainstream media, could you?
[00:10:43.007 --> 00:10:45.969]  Just the headlines I just read you are enough to know that that's the case.
[00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:48.411]  But he was fired by H.R.
[00:10:48.431 --> 00:10:51.072]  McMaster and the Atlantic says this is a victory.
[00:10:51.573 --> 00:10:52.633]  Victory for H.R.
[00:10:52.653 --> 00:10:53.114]  McMaster.
[00:10:53.154 --> 00:10:53.734]  Yes it is.
[00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:55.755]  It is a victory for the establishment.
[00:10:56.416 --> 00:11:07.343]  They say he believes that the president is under threat from dark forces plotting to undermine him and those like McMaster who dismiss this as conspiratorial thinking.
[00:11:08.183 --> 00:11:11.666]  Say the actual conspirators like McMaster.
[00:11:12.594 --> 00:11:20.001]  Rich Higgins is the guy who was fired, a former Pentagon official who served as the NSC Strategic Planning Office as a Director for Strategic Planning.
[00:11:20.541 --> 00:11:21.963]  He was fired on July 21st.
[00:11:22.483 --> 00:11:28.209]  Higgins' memo describes supposed domestic and international threats to Trump's presidency, including
[00:11:28.789 --> 00:11:37.656]  Globalist, bankers, the deep state, and islamicists characterizes the Russian story as a plot to sabotage Trump's nationalist agenda.
[00:11:38.076 --> 00:11:44.581]  He said globalists and islamicists recognize that for their vision to succeed, America, both as an ideal
[00:11:45.502 --> 00:11:49.903]  And as a national and political identity must be destroyed.
[00:11:49.963 --> 00:11:51.544]  And that's what we're looking at right now.
[00:11:51.664 --> 00:12:00.087]  Quite frankly, he's joined in that assessment not only by us, and many in the free media, but also by the Russian Prime Minister.
[00:12:00.807 --> 00:12:07.589]  And this comes after the signing of US sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
[00:12:08.772 --> 00:12:14.875]  As NPR reports, the Russian Prime Minister slams Trump administration's weakness over U.S.
[00:12:14.915 --> 00:12:15.395]  sanctions.
[00:12:15.415 --> 00:12:23.700]  They say Russian Prime Minister Medvedev has penned a scathing Facebook post in response to new U.S.
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:33.505]  sanctions, decrying what he described as the Trump administration's total weakness, saying that the package, the sanctions package, ends hopes for improving our relations with the new administration.
[00:12:34.085 --> 00:12:38.830]  He described the sanctions as a declaration of full-fledged economic war on Russia.
[00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.694]  And I said this a couple of weeks ago when this first came out.
[00:12:42.815 --> 00:12:49.602]  And we saw the memo coming from the European Union saying that within days they were going to respond to the US.
[00:12:49.822 --> 00:12:50.002]  Why?
[00:12:50.042 --> 00:12:54.587]  Why would the EU be so upset about sanctions on Russia?
[00:12:55.486 --> 00:13:02.891]  Well, it's because we have decided that those sanctions are going to shut off their supply of energy, which is natural gas coming from Russia.
[00:13:02.911 --> 00:13:05.373]  That's a key component of European industry.
[00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:12.438]  And the Germans have said, you don't have the power to decide what our energy policy is going to be.
[00:13:13.138 --> 00:13:16.561]  And so they said that they're going to have measures to come against the United States.
[00:13:16.601 --> 00:13:18.222]  So it's going to set off a trade war.
[00:13:18.282 --> 00:13:23.746]  This coming from the people who are telling us all along, the never Trumpers who said Donald Trump is a nationalist.
[00:13:24.126 --> 00:13:28.409]  Donald Trump is going to create a trade war with protectionism.
[00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.813]  No, now we have the establishment creating a trade war with sanctions.
[00:13:33.749 --> 00:13:35.871]  The military-industrial complex doing that.
[00:13:36.552 --> 00:13:37.192]  He said the U.S.
[00:13:37.252 --> 00:13:38.834]  establishment fully outwitted him.
[00:13:39.294 --> 00:13:42.017]  He says it changes the power balance in U.S.
[00:13:42.157 --> 00:13:43.178]  political circles.
[00:13:43.518 --> 00:13:48.783]  I would say not so much that they outwitted him, but that they just overwhelmed him.
[00:13:48.943 --> 00:13:50.424]  Take a look at the vote.
[00:13:50.545 --> 00:13:52.406]  We had the House vote 419 to 3.
[00:13:52.446 --> 00:13:52.686]  419 to 3.
[00:13:52.727 --> 00:13:53.687]  The Senate voted 98 to 2.
[00:14:00.306 --> 00:14:01.127]  98 to 2.
[00:14:01.627 --> 00:14:02.827]  Virtually unanimous.
[00:14:02.947 --> 00:14:10.090]  Now, to override a veto, if Donald Trump were to veto these sanctions, they would only need two-thirds of both houses.
[00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.571]  It's nearly unanimous in both houses.
[00:14:12.711 --> 00:14:14.412]  Why is it nearly unanimous?
[00:14:15.012 --> 00:14:16.613]  Well, because they came up with this agreement.
[00:14:16.633 --> 00:14:18.634]  Remember, we had Ronald Reagan as president.
[00:14:19.494 --> 00:14:20.855]  The Republicans wanted tax cuts.
[00:14:20.915 --> 00:14:21.915]  Reagan wanted tax cuts.
[00:14:22.535 --> 00:14:25.056]  The Democrats wanted to spend more money on welfare programs.
[00:14:25.076 --> 00:14:25.897]  So they said, okay, fine.
[00:14:26.502 --> 00:14:32.686]  You let me spend more money on defense and give me tax cuts and I'll let you spend more money on welfare and what do we see?
[00:14:32.727 --> 00:14:33.907]  We saw the deficit explode.
[00:14:33.967 --> 00:14:38.671]  Now we're going to see maybe the world explode because we see the trade war.
[00:14:39.251 --> 00:14:42.413]  Trade wars and sanctions are usually a prelude to real war.
[00:14:43.254 --> 00:14:53.583]  And starting in the last administration, the Obama administration with Hillary Clinton, the establishment was moving very hard to re-establish a Cold War, which can turn into a real war.
[00:14:54.203 --> 00:15:00.108]  So basically what they have done is to nearly unanimously put Trump into a corner.
[00:15:00.768 --> 00:15:02.150]  And this is what the Russian Prime Minister said.
[00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:08.235]  He said, the new steps are to come and they will ultimately aim to remove him from power.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.462]  Yeah, we know that's going to happen, and we just told you how they're going to be doing this.
[00:15:13.522 --> 00:15:17.003]  Now, what did Trump do in response, and why would he sign this?
[00:15:17.663 --> 00:15:23.285]  Well, as I said, it wouldn't do any good not to sign it, to veto it, because they can easily override this.
[00:15:23.425 --> 00:15:33.810]  But what he did was he signed it with a signing statement, which I think is the very best that he could do, reserving to himself powers under the Constitution that belong to him.
[00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:36.651]  As USA Today points out, there were two
[00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:40.032]  Separate statements from President Trump.
[00:15:40.192 --> 00:15:47.115]  One of them was a PR statement and as usual it was the same kind of language that you would hear the President use in a speech or that he would put out on Twitter.
[00:15:47.675 --> 00:15:50.616]  The other one they said was very dry and legalistic.
[00:15:51.136 --> 00:15:53.037]  That's the one that we want to pay attention to.
[00:15:53.757 --> 00:15:56.878]  Not the press statement, but the second signing statement.
[00:15:57.358 --> 00:16:01.940]  And this is something, as they point out, it's a tool that's been used for a long time by both parties.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.380]  Presidents from both parties.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.861]  It's not just something that Trump did.
[00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:10.223]  It wasn't something that was invented by George W. Bush, although his administration used it quite a bit.
[00:16:10.783 --> 00:16:15.666]  To say that he was going to ignore laws that intruded on his expansive definition of presidential power.
[00:16:16.026 --> 00:16:17.266]  That's USA Today's assessment.
[00:16:17.327 --> 00:16:18.627]  I basically agree with that.
[00:16:18.647 --> 00:16:22.649]  I think George Bush went way over the line in terms of the things that he did.
[00:16:22.709 --> 00:16:29.573]  But here's some of the things that Trump reserved to himself in that legal signing statement that he put there, the second one.
[00:16:29.853 --> 00:16:38.158]  Provisions that Trump said would purport to displace the president's exclusive constitutional authority to recognize foreign governments, including their territorial bounds.
[00:16:38.218 --> 00:16:40.519]  And he cites a 2015 Supreme Court case.
[00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:40.899]  Another one.
[00:16:41.259 --> 00:16:49.484]  Procedure for congressional review of administration attempts to relax or waive sanctions, which Trump said amount to an unconstitutional legislative veto.
[00:16:49.924 --> 00:16:59.654]  And they point out that presidents of both parties have raised this objection to similar schemes since the Supreme Court struck down the legislative veto back in 1983.
[00:17:00.355 --> 00:17:03.498]  So what they're saying to him is that you can't get rid of these sanctions.
[00:17:03.979 --> 00:17:05.961]  And he says, well no, quite frankly I can.
[00:17:06.281 --> 00:17:08.743]  The Constitution and the Supreme Court in 1983 said that I can.
[00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:11.806]  And so he's reserving these.
[00:17:12.187 --> 00:17:18.472]  I think it's more important for him to sign it and to say, these are the constitutional powers that I am reserving.
[00:17:18.692 --> 00:17:19.133]  One of those.
[00:17:19.193 --> 00:17:19.553]  Another one.
[00:17:19.613 --> 00:17:23.837]  Initiatives to help Eastern European countries counter Russian influence.
[00:17:23.937 --> 00:17:24.558]  Now listen to this.
[00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:31.083]  Including a $250 million cyber security fund and a Ukrainian energy security program.
[00:17:31.324 --> 00:17:33.125]  So they're putting all of these things in there.
[00:17:33.225 --> 00:17:34.707]  They're loading this thing up.
[00:17:35.327 --> 00:17:37.628]  With pork for the Ukrainian government!
[00:17:38.168 --> 00:17:40.529]  That should tell you something.
[00:17:40.849 --> 00:17:42.469]  It should tell you the basis of this.
[00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:49.332]  It's really about trying to restart the Cold War, as they did in Ukraine, as they did in Syria.
[00:17:49.812 --> 00:17:51.853]  These actions that they have done with regime change.
[00:17:51.893 --> 00:17:56.034]  Another one, provisions that block certain sanctioned individuals from entering the United States.
[00:17:56.314 --> 00:17:57.955]  Does that sound like a travel ban?
[00:17:59.008 --> 00:18:00.349]  See, it's okay if the Congress does it.
[00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:05.011]  It's okay if the Obama administration or Hillary Clinton does it, but Trump better not do a travel ban.
[00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:14.036]  Trump said there are not going to be any exceptions to the President's constitutional responsibility to receive ambassadors and other public ministers.
[00:18:14.096 --> 00:18:18.238]  So he says, I have the authority to let particular people in.
[00:18:18.679 --> 00:18:20.880]  I'm not going to surrender that authority.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.261]  But as they point out,
[00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:25.322]  They presented him with a veto-proof bill.
[00:18:25.702 --> 00:18:30.103]  The best he could do, which is what he did, was to say, these are the constitutional issues.
[00:18:30.463 --> 00:18:36.304]  When we come back, I'm going to talk about a West Virginia governor who switched from Democrat to Republican.
[00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:42.046]  That's anticipated by the New York Times and a rally that's being held in West Virginia tonight, a Trump rally that's being held there.
[00:18:42.566 --> 00:18:52.292]  We're going to talk about how that plays into the move by Californians to secede and a conservative Utah legislator who wants to do everything he can to help them go.
[00:18:52.612 --> 00:18:53.393]  I hope he succeeds.
[00:18:53.413 --> 00:18:53.733]  Stay with us.
[00:18:53.753 --> 00:18:54.374]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:01.358 --> 00:19:05.821]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy.
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:14.572]  In the last segment, I outlined how the Washington establishment is moving against Trump.
[00:23:14.652 --> 00:23:18.513]  Trying to box him in politically, trying to entrap him legally.
[00:23:19.294 --> 00:23:26.196]  Now, tonight he's going to be having a rally in West Virginia, a state that he carried by a 42 point margin.
[00:23:26.456 --> 00:23:27.097]  Well, why is that?
[00:23:27.157 --> 00:23:33.359]  Well, because Hillary Clinton had said that she was going to shut down the coal industry just like Obama had promised to do, and they pretty much did it.
[00:23:33.999 --> 00:23:35.580]  The newly elected governor there
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.622]  Is looking at the thousands of people that show up at every Trump rally.
[00:23:39.682 --> 00:23:41.624]  Totally unprecedented in my lifetime.
[00:23:41.684 --> 00:23:44.525]  And he's decided that where he needs to be is with Donald Trump.
[00:23:45.146 --> 00:23:48.568]  And so now Donald Trump has teased a very big announcement.
[00:23:49.048 --> 00:23:51.770]  He teased it from the White House saying that it's going to be coming today at the rally.
[00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:56.894]  The New York Times believes that the West Virginia governor is going to switch from Democrat to Republican.
[00:23:57.554 --> 00:23:59.555]  Joining the trend of voters.
[00:24:00.396 --> 00:24:04.959]  As ATR.org points out, starting tonight, GOP voters will have control of 26 states.
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.981]  And that means the Governor ships.
[00:24:08.161 --> 00:24:14.045]  And then they also had in this article, they said the population of GOP-controlled states is 164 million.
[00:24:14.065 --> 00:24:17.308]  The population of Democrat-controlled states, 50 million.
[00:24:17.328 --> 00:24:23.452]  In other words, the Democrat population of the controlled states is 23% of the country and the Republicans are 77%.
[00:24:23.832 --> 00:24:25.093]  So where do you want to be?
[00:24:25.173 --> 00:24:27.735]  Do you want to be with the 80% or the 20%?
[00:24:28.155 --> 00:24:30.477]  The West Virginia Governor wisely said he wants to be with the 80%.
[00:24:32.265 --> 00:24:36.155]  And as we look at what's going on with California, the attempts of
[00:24:37.236 --> 00:24:41.079]  The Democrats to shut down the economy in West Virginia.
[00:24:41.099 --> 00:24:45.882]  And what they would like to do is shut down our entire economy using global warming as an excuse.
[00:24:45.922 --> 00:24:51.225]  We see a Utah conservative saying that he would like to help them to secede.
[00:24:51.746 --> 00:24:53.527]  And so he's got a measure that he's putting out there.
[00:24:53.567 --> 00:24:55.488]  This is Utah Representative Paul Ray.
[00:24:55.548 --> 00:24:59.331]  He said, this is just kind of a wake-up call from the state of Utah that says, you know what?
[00:24:59.711 --> 00:25:00.572]  You guys don't get it.
[00:25:00.932 --> 00:25:02.013]  They don't control other states.
[00:25:02.053 --> 00:25:04.955]  And quite honestly, most of us don't really care for their politics.
[00:25:05.635 --> 00:25:09.762]  He's still drafting, he said, language for the measure which would recommend tariffs on California.
[00:25:09.782 --> 00:25:15.312]  That's not going to help if it became its own country for the energy and water that it uses that come from Utah.
[00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:20.641]  So they're taking water and energy from Utah, and he says you're going to pay for it.
[00:25:20.681 --> 00:25:23.623]  That's not going to help to get them out of there, but he has this to say, and I agree with him.
[00:25:23.663 --> 00:25:28.606]  He said, they think that they're owed a lot, and they just think that they've got the power to dictate.
[00:25:29.026 --> 00:25:34.450]  But if they really look at it, they can't function without federal money going into California and doing business with other states.
[00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:43.255]  And a good example of the insanity from California and the way they want to control us is this latest article, Fido and Fluffy are ruining the environment, says a
[00:25:44.156 --> 00:25:46.077]  University of California in Los Angeles study.
[00:25:46.137 --> 00:25:49.158]  Where else would it come from but crazy California to say something like this?
[00:25:49.178 --> 00:25:52.739]  Yes, I'm afraid it may be raining cats and dogs.
[00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.019]  So watch out for the weather.
[00:25:54.499 --> 00:25:59.621]  No, we just don't want California raining over us as in ruling over us.
[00:26:00.101 --> 00:26:01.101]  They want to shut down everything.
[00:26:01.361 --> 00:26:02.562]  They want to take your cars.
[00:26:02.842 --> 00:26:04.042]  They want to kill your pets.
[00:26:04.402 --> 00:26:05.802]  They think you should have fewer children.
[00:26:05.823 --> 00:26:06.823]  They want to kill your children.
[00:26:07.563 --> 00:26:13.267]  These people are absolutely insane control freaks, and it's one of the reasons that we should get away from them.
[00:26:13.287 --> 00:26:22.792]  And I think it's kind of ironic that the West Virginian governor is now doing this, because West Virginia, frankly, is the only state to successfully secede since the original 13.
[00:26:22.832 --> 00:26:24.854]  They seceded from Virginia.
[00:26:25.194 --> 00:26:29.396]  Virginia said, we recognize that, the right of self-government, we recognize that as a right.
[00:26:29.456 --> 00:26:30.317]  Yes, you may go.
[00:26:31.137 --> 00:26:33.619]  And they kept that distinction after the war.
[00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:34.700]  Now also,
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:42.446]  Coming out of Alabama, we have a lesbian mom who has asked a Christian judge to recuse himself from a divorce case.
[00:26:42.486 --> 00:26:45.869]  And I ask, is this going to now be a litmus test?
[00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:48.531]  That we can have no Christians as judges?
[00:26:49.212 --> 00:26:50.252]  Would it go the other way around?
[00:26:50.292 --> 00:26:53.315]  Could Christians say we don't want a lesbian judge to rule over us?
[00:26:53.355 --> 00:26:54.276]  Meanwhile, look at this.
[00:26:54.716 --> 00:26:59.740]  Atheist Richard Dawkins, very well known for attacking Christians, but when he goes after Muslims,
[00:27:00.481 --> 00:27:02.383]  They shut him down on the radio.
[00:27:02.583 --> 00:27:02.883]  Where?
[00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:03.784]  California!
[00:27:03.844 --> 00:27:05.145]  Where else would they shut him down?
[00:27:05.425 --> 00:27:08.308]  KPFA said it was hurtful remarks about Islam.
[00:27:08.448 --> 00:27:11.310]  He's been making hurtful remarks about Christianity, but that's okay.
[00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:12.131]  We can take it.
[00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:13.592]  We know what the truth is.
[00:27:14.052 --> 00:27:17.996]  I've heard there's a Dawkins, but I've never actually met him, so maybe he doesn't really exist.
[00:27:18.376 --> 00:27:19.397]  And this is in a state.
[00:27:19.857 --> 00:27:24.561]  We just had a California Imam praying for Allah to annihilate the Jews.
[00:27:24.661 --> 00:27:25.802]  This is the insanity.
[00:27:26.103 --> 00:27:28.505]  This is the double standard of the left.
[00:27:29.065 --> 00:27:31.287]  And this is why we would like to help California leave.
[00:27:31.747 --> 00:27:33.469]  Let us know if there's anything that we can do.
[00:27:34.069 --> 00:27:39.775]  And we'd like, for those of you in the conservative areas of California, we'd like for you to be able to stay or to join other states.
[00:27:39.835 --> 00:27:45.299]  Now, in the next segment, we've got an interview that I recorded earlier today from Sherry Duvallet with Redoubt News.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.103]  There's a trial going on in Bunkerville and she breaks this down for us.
[00:27:50.759 --> 00:27:59.909]  Joining us now for an update to the Bunkerville trial, and of course these are, this is not the Bundys yet, these are some of the people who were there, is Sherry Duvalli with Readout News.
[00:27:59.969 --> 00:28:00.850]  Sherry, thank you for joining us.
[00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.531]  Thank you.
[00:28:03.332 --> 00:28:07.617]  Now you said there is a, there was a move for a mistrial yesterday.
[00:28:07.677 --> 00:28:09.719]  Tell us why that was and what happened today.
[00:28:09.739 --> 00:28:13.443]  The prosecution has brought in
[00:28:14.122 --> 00:28:19.846]  A post made by one of the defendants a year after the Bunkerville standoff.
[00:28:20.246 --> 00:28:25.650]  Now they can do this because they extended the date of the conspiracy to March of 2016.
[00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:32.055]  So they're calling it, um, bad acts after the fact.
[00:28:33.036 --> 00:28:40.181]  Now the post made, it was a very long post that referenced several things, but one word in there was the word McVeigh.
[00:28:41.371 --> 00:28:58.259]  Well, it was only supposed to be read to the jury, but the prosecutor kind of slipped in and made the FBI agent stop and explain who McVeigh was, naming not just Timothy McVeigh, but extending it out to the Oklahoma City bomber.
[00:28:58.319 --> 00:29:02.500]  He bombed the building in Oklahoma, several people died, things like that.
[00:29:03.381 --> 00:29:07.063]  So after the jury left, the defense asked for a mistrial.
[00:29:07.103 --> 00:29:08.503]  It was ruled on today that
[00:29:11.508 --> 00:29:21.492]  It was denied, and the prosecutor specifically said there is really not that much difference between what they did and what they did.
[00:29:22.052 --> 00:29:22.532]  Oh, really?
[00:29:22.753 --> 00:29:23.153]  Oh, really?
[00:29:23.253 --> 00:29:23.633]  Okay.
[00:29:23.693 --> 00:29:24.953]  Well, you know, I was there.
[00:29:25.654 --> 00:29:27.134]  Nobody was harmed by this.
[00:29:27.214 --> 00:29:29.475]  Nobody was threatening anyone other than the BLM.
[00:29:29.735 --> 00:29:38.879]  And, of course, I think it was interesting because in your article, Readout News, you pointed out it was a very long post, which you said, and they edited out a reference to the Millers.
[00:29:38.939 --> 00:29:40.880]  And, of course, this is Jared Miller and someone else who
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.201]  I think so.
[00:30:01.397 --> 00:30:02.238]  We're good to go.
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:27.201]  And so that would show that they were not the dangerous characters who are trying to portray them in the trial.
[00:30:27.541 --> 00:30:31.662]  What was the context for the McVeigh quote?
[00:30:32.782 --> 00:30:41.844]  They were just talking about mistakes that McVeigh made and going against what the movement was all about and such like that.
[00:30:42.724 --> 00:30:49.666]  Just real quick, I was just handed a note that the prosecution just made a statement in the courtroom that militias are illegal.
[00:30:50.734 --> 00:30:51.094]  Oh, really?
[00:30:51.114 --> 00:30:53.696]  Okay, so the Second Amendment is, I guess, illegal as well.
[00:30:54.877 --> 00:30:55.518]  That's interesting.
[00:30:55.538 --> 00:30:56.078]  I am guessing.
[00:30:56.138 --> 00:31:00.082]  I will give you some more updates on that one after I get in there and find out what's going on.
[00:31:00.382 --> 00:31:02.403]  But they are pulling out all the stops.
[00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:09.009]  They're trying to demonize anybody that not only supports the Constitution, but wants to defend themselves and their neighbors.
[00:31:10.154 --> 00:31:19.076]  Well, and the people that were there, they were carrying, legally, according to Nevada state law, they were not brandishing weapons to threaten anybody.
[00:31:19.117 --> 00:31:25.618]  As a matter of fact, the people who were brandishing and pointing weapons that I saw were the BLM, and of course they were threatening people over their loudspeakers.
[00:31:25.878 --> 00:31:35.761]  I think it's also interesting, what you pointed out on July 28th, when you talked about Eric Parker, he had no scope on his weapons, so he couldn't have hit anybody from that range, as they pointed out.
[00:31:36.161 --> 00:31:38.522]  But I think it's also, you pointed out, it's also significant
[00:31:39.002 --> 00:31:45.408]  Two Nevada State Troopers were patrolling and doing traffic control on the bridge while Parker and Drexler lay prone.
[00:31:45.469 --> 00:31:51.414]  Parker testified in the first trial that one trooper even conversed with him as he was lying on the pavement.
[00:31:51.514 --> 00:31:53.837]  So he was not in a threatening position.
[00:31:53.877 --> 00:32:02.886]  We can also see people who are crouching down beside the concrete barriers on the side of the road because they were concerned about the threats from the BLM.
[00:32:04.181 --> 00:32:18.477]  Well, it was mentioned in court that the reason that Parker and them crouched down is because they could see the snipers up on the mesa, and what they did, they called it a green light, that the snipers were pointed directly at them.
[00:32:18.938 --> 00:32:21.281]  And that's what made them crouch down behind the barrier.
[00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:39.595]  But of course, all of this is being suppressed by the judge who wants to take away any, silence any aggressive actions by the BLM and strictly paint these individuals as dangerous, anti-government, and as you pointed out, just said that the militia is illegal.
[00:32:40.175 --> 00:32:41.336]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:32:41.396 --> 00:32:48.138]  I know you've got to get back into court and we're talking to Sherry Duvalli and you can keep up with these updates at readoutnews.com.
[00:32:48.158 --> 00:32:48.998]  Thank you so much, Sherry.
[00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:50.633]  Thank you, David.
[00:32:50.673 --> 00:32:52.016]  I appreciate you having me on.
[00:32:52.617 --> 00:32:53.720]  We'll be looking for more updates.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.723]  Thank you so much for covering it.

[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.

[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.
[00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:50.995]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.

[00:34:53.896 --> 00:34:56.718]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:59.539]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:53.827]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:53.867 --> 00:36:54.727]  We fight the New World Order.

[00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:16.432]  The deep state coup against President Trump has gone hot and they are in an absolute panic right now to pull all the lovers, all the strings in order to get Trump removed.
[00:37:16.712 --> 00:37:19.693]  We have a litany of news we're going to cover here with Leanne McAdoo.
[00:37:20.053 --> 00:37:21.193]  Leanne, let's start with
[00:37:21.693 --> 00:37:29.236]  The Susan Rice angle, because you had Susan Rice who's being looked at for possibly unmasking felonious behavior.
[00:37:29.636 --> 00:37:32.337]  Now you've got Ben Rhodes who's also being looked in for that.
[00:37:32.677 --> 00:37:40.840]  But McMaster has still decided to allow Susan Rice the top security clearance that she already had.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.641]  A shocking development here.
[00:37:44.207 --> 00:37:44.747]  Exactly.
[00:37:44.967 --> 00:37:46.408]  Where are the Trump loyalists?
[00:37:46.488 --> 00:37:52.891]  I thought that that was what we were starting to see is a shift towards getting people in Trump's administration that were loyal to him.
[00:37:52.931 --> 00:37:56.272]  But what we're actually seeing is a purge of the Trump loyalists.
[00:37:56.652 --> 00:38:02.775]  So right at the same time that President Trump is out speaking with the media and telling the American people about the surveillance,
[00:38:03.215 --> 00:38:14.470]  Talking about the unmasking and how, you know, embarrassing, how terrible this is for the United States and for the Trump administration, how illegal it is, and that somebody needs to be taken to task on this.
[00:38:15.434 --> 00:38:20.559]  McMaster at the same exact time is saying, I don't think Susan Rice did anything wrong.
[00:38:20.639 --> 00:38:24.882]  So I'm going to go ahead and renew her security clearance at the level that she's had.
[00:38:24.902 --> 00:38:37.533]  So at the, all this time that these Trump leaks are happening, Susan Rice is right there with full access when the president is, is voicing his displeasure with the fact that this unmasking and surveillance was taking place.
[00:38:37.913 --> 00:38:44.716]  Well, and think about the double standard here, where you have McMaster assuming Susan Rice did nothing wrong.
[00:38:45.116 --> 00:38:46.476]  Well, how can you make that assumption?
[00:38:46.516 --> 00:38:50.478]  We're not finished with this probe, this unmasking investigation yet.
[00:38:50.938 --> 00:38:59.861]  But at the same time, they're still looking into Trump's Russia collusion, but you can't make any confirmations or assumptions there because that's not completed either.
[00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:04.443]  So, how is he able to make an assumption on Susan Rice's innocence, but not President Trump's?
[00:39:04.463 --> 00:39:06.304]  That's a complete double standard from McMaster.
[00:39:07.628 --> 00:39:07.848]  Right.
[00:39:07.928 --> 00:39:20.391]  And I'm wondering, you know, are they saying, well, let's not charge any of these former Obama administration officials with any illegal activity because we want to save that type of illegal activity for our administration.
[00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:23.331]  We want to be able to go ahead and unmask any American citizens.
[00:39:23.351 --> 00:39:30.113]  So let's not draw attention and define that as being something illegal, which the Democrats and the media, they're really not
[00:39:31.693 --> 00:39:43.286]  They're not upset about the fact that the Obama administration used the security agencies for their political purposes to unmask their political opponents and to spy on these conversations.
[00:39:43.766 --> 00:39:50.253]  But the fact is, the Trump administration can turn around and do the exact same thing to spy on their political opponents.
[00:39:50.533 --> 00:39:52.514]  So when is the media going to be outraged?
[00:39:52.615 --> 00:39:55.336]  When are the Democrats, when are people going to say, look, this is illegal.
[00:39:55.677 --> 00:39:58.799]  We're supposed to be protecting the identity of American citizens here.
[00:39:59.099 --> 00:40:00.480]  This was absolutely wrong.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:05.903]  Instead, we've got McMaster in there saying she did nothing wrong, even though she's an Obama holdover.
[00:40:05.983 --> 00:40:10.186]  And I'm going to continue to allow her to have this high level security clearance.
[00:40:11.007 --> 00:40:20.133]  And then so, you know, I don't know if maybe Trump was thinking by militarizing his administration and putting McMaster there to be the national security advisor, this would stop the leaks.
[00:40:20.791 --> 00:40:29.579]  But obviously that has not happened, as we have this next major leak today with President Trump's phone conversations with some world leaders.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:33.463]  And these leaks are absolutely paralyzing this administration.
[00:40:33.583 --> 00:40:36.346]  It's stopping them from being able to function properly.
[00:40:36.366 --> 00:40:38.948]  It's putting the administration in chaos.
[00:40:39.228 --> 00:40:45.735]  So this is allowing the media to go ahead and continue to spin this narrative that the Trump administration is out of control.
[00:40:46.135 --> 00:40:47.315]  Well that's exactly it.
[00:40:47.355 --> 00:40:49.076]  I think that that's exactly it right there.
[00:40:49.136 --> 00:41:04.600]  They're allowing these false narratives and they're allowing the media to concoct narratives twisting and as you said spinning however they want these leaks and as you said if militarizing his cabinet was an effort to stop the leaks it didn't work.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.023]  Scaramucci was somebody we thought was going to be put in to stop the leaks, fire the leakers.
[00:41:09.264 --> 00:41:16.690]  He was ousted in 10 days, and yeah, now it looks like they're identifying the leaker to the Washington Post.
[00:41:17.491 --> 00:41:21.774]  The Inquisitor is saying that it's Megan Baitich that's being blamed.
[00:41:22.115 --> 00:41:30.362]  And back to McMaster for a second, you gotta credit Mike Cernovich, who was really the first to target McMaster as the leader of the Deep State months ago.
[00:41:30.722 --> 00:41:31.623]  Now you've got Breitbart
[00:41:32.043 --> 00:41:35.784]  Reporting how McMaster is deeply hostile to Israel and to Trump.
[00:41:36.104 --> 00:41:41.867]  You've got Newsweek, when you've got Newsweek running cover, they're the ones that printed Madame President, you know that you're on to something.
[00:41:42.147 --> 00:41:44.407]  Why is the alt-right attacking McMaster?
[00:41:44.888 --> 00:41:54.231]  I think that, you know, with all the leaks, with all the developments, everything we're seeing, we're starting to identify McMaster possibly as the member of the deep state, the swamp that needs to be drained.
[00:41:55.387 --> 00:41:55.807]  Well, right.
[00:41:55.867 --> 00:42:04.233]  And everyone who voted for President Trump really needs to be concerned as we're watching the purging of Trump loyalists from his administration.
[00:42:04.834 --> 00:42:21.946]  The fact that one of the National Security Council, their Rich Higgins was fired, I believe, after putting out this memo that Trump's administration was under attack from pro-Islamists, that they were creating sort of a side group that would attack the president from within.
[00:42:21.966 --> 00:42:23.127]  He was fired.
[00:42:23.587 --> 00:42:36.117]  And it's basically anyone who wants to come out and speak about this pro-Islamist in the administration, how there is a coup going on, how the deep state is actually attacking Trump and his agenda.
[00:42:36.437 --> 00:42:38.879]  Those people are getting fired en masse.
[00:42:39.259 --> 00:42:43.361]  And so we know that Trump met with McMaster this morning.
[00:42:43.681 --> 00:42:44.721]  What are they talking about?
[00:42:44.881 --> 00:42:48.702]  Is Trump hearing the American people who are saying, fire McMaster?
[00:42:49.203 --> 00:42:50.043]  He's trouble.
[00:42:50.543 --> 00:42:55.565]  Or does he have his ear totally caught by the neocons there now that he is in the White House?
[00:42:55.945 --> 00:42:56.565]  Well, that's right.
[00:42:56.585 --> 00:43:02.409]  And then you have the story talking about General Kelly trying to control the information that's getting to Trump.
[00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:05.050]  That chain of command is completely out of whack.
[00:43:05.351 --> 00:43:09.553]  So you know you've got filters filtering Donald Trump and what he sees.
[00:43:09.913 --> 00:43:17.638]  You've got McMasters spinning levers and he's twisting up things over there, letting Susan Rice continue to operate, saying she's innocent.
[00:43:18.078 --> 00:43:22.461]  Then you've got the swamp encroaching on President Trump, as today it was announced a U.S.
[00:43:22.521 --> 00:43:25.743]  grand jury is now empaneled for the Russia probe.
[00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:27.564]  How can this not be stopped?
[00:43:27.664 --> 00:43:33.688]  Why are they continuing to let this Russia probe run by Robert Mueller and his team of Clinton lawyers go on?
[00:43:35.037 --> 00:43:46.123]  Right, and at the same time we see some of the House Judiciary Republicans there calling for a second special counsel to go ahead and investigate Hillary Clinton and James Comey and Loretta Lynch.
[00:43:46.403 --> 00:43:49.064]  There is corruption on the other side as well.
[00:43:49.085 --> 00:43:51.526]  Yeah, it wouldn't take long for that to be identified.
[00:43:52.281 --> 00:44:07.010]  They're ramping up this investigation, this Russia investigation, and I feel like they're going to try to impeach the president or get him out before they're able to open up this second special counsel and expose the corruption on that end.
[00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:14.554]  So it really feels like the deep state is fully encircled around President Trump, and I'm just curious where his head is at.
[00:44:14.634 --> 00:44:16.095]  What does he know that we don't?
[00:44:17.856 --> 00:44:19.678]  Well, that's interesting.
[00:44:20.479 --> 00:44:25.825]  If there's any indicator of where his head's at or where we think we could get the best indicator, we would go to his Twitter.
[00:44:26.226 --> 00:44:31.672]  And it seems like for the most part, he's focused on good news every once in a while, attacking members of the liberal media.
[00:44:31.712 --> 00:44:33.734]  People don't like him for that, but that seems to be at least...
[00:44:34.395 --> 00:44:34.955]  We're good to go.
[00:45:01.713 --> 00:45:22.571]  Right, and the only thing I can be happy about is the fact that we are seeing some people in his administration actually taking a page out of the alternative media playbook and pushing back against the mainstream media and their bias and actually, in their face, listing the things that the media refuses to cover, which to my knowledge, Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the media out on Tuesday.
[00:45:22.752 --> 00:45:26.535]  I haven't seen any of those establishment outlets even put out a fact check
[00:45:26.935 --> 00:45:28.516]  Based on what she called them out on.
[00:45:28.536 --> 00:45:30.556]  So they're completely burying that story.
[00:45:30.576 --> 00:45:36.058]  It's just so evident how they're completely biased and trying to hide information from the American people.
[00:45:36.898 --> 00:45:42.700]  And I think the developing thing that we're going to see now, this is how Alex Jones closed the Alex Jones Radio Show today.
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.841]  This is what was on my mind all day.
[00:45:44.861 --> 00:45:55.084]  And it just feels like everybody right now is maybe feeling like President Trump might end up being a political martyr for the pro-American revolution in the West.
[00:45:56.363 --> 00:45:56.603]  Wow.
[00:45:56.623 --> 00:45:59.046]  I don't know, Leigh-Anne, what are your thoughts here?
[00:45:59.066 --> 00:46:00.007]  Final 60 seconds.
[00:46:01.289 --> 00:46:11.981]  Well, I'm just, you know, I'm kind of going back to election night when you were wanting to celebrate and I was saying, look, we know that they're not going to take this lying down and I really... That was because I knew he was going to win, though.
[00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:13.090]  Yeah.
[00:46:13.691 --> 00:46:17.654]  Well, I just, I knew that we weren't kind of out of the woods just yet.
[00:46:17.774 --> 00:46:25.681]  And I really feel like, I think people out there really need to pray for President Trump, that he can be surrounded by the right kind of people, because I don't think he is at the moment.
[00:46:25.741 --> 00:46:28.383]  And they're certainly purging the people who are loyal to him.
[00:46:29.215 --> 00:46:36.619]  Yeah, and we need to do everything we can to try to pierce the armor of the deep state that's keeping information from getting to President Trump.
[00:46:36.659 --> 00:46:38.300]  Thank you so much, Leanne McAdoo.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.840]  It's amazing, folks.
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.681]  These are incredible times.
[00:46:41.721 --> 00:46:43.382]  This is what Alex Jones has been talking about.
[00:46:43.402 --> 00:46:45.123]  This is what we've all been talking about.
[00:46:45.163 --> 00:46:48.865]  It feels like it's all been building up to this climax.
[00:46:49.285 --> 00:46:51.146]  Who will win the culture war?
[00:46:51.406 --> 00:46:56.849]  Will President Trump be a political martyr, or will he defeat the deep state and drain the swamp?
[00:46:56.869 --> 00:46:58.210]  Stay tuned at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:02.978 --> 00:47:07.760]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.421 --> 00:47:10.021]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.402 --> 00:47:15.404]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.744 --> 00:47:21.207]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.587 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.814]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.894 --> 00:48:20.055]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.215 --> 00:48:25.118]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nacinidine X2.
[00:48:25.318 --> 00:48:30.301]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.481 --> 00:48:34.043]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.363 --> 00:48:37.324]  Still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.364 --> 00:48:38.624]  It's a key building block of the body.
[00:48:38.744 --> 00:48:45.666]  And if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.786 --> 00:48:48.427]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.447 --> 00:48:49.467]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.807 --> 00:48:50.507]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.547 --> 00:48:51.148]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.528 --> 00:48:59.070]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield, nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll-free.
[00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:00.010]  We can answer your questions, 888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.953 --> 00:49:08.714]  The so-called left wants control of the culture.
[00:49:08.754 --> 00:49:13.657]  It's a power trip and a lot of people existentially through it feel like they're in power when they're not.
[00:49:13.917 --> 00:49:25.504]  They're imagining with reflected glory from Hillary that they're in charge and now that their idol has fallen, they don't know what to do and are attacking more than ever to bully people into submission and that's backfiring spectacularly.
[00:49:25.764 --> 00:49:26.805]  So let me ask you this question.
[00:49:28.331 --> 00:49:30.734]  Where are they culturally on the so-called left?
[00:49:30.794 --> 00:49:34.117]  And where do you see it going as they get more and more histrionic, more and more desperate?
[00:49:34.537 --> 00:49:35.799]  They're saying kill the president.
[00:49:36.099 --> 00:49:37.160]  They're saying coup d'etat.
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:40.424]  They've got former CIA directors on TV saying we're about to overthrow him.
[00:49:41.064 --> 00:49:43.467]  We've got congressmen saying, yeah, they're shopping it on the Hill.
[00:49:44.067 --> 00:49:47.791]  Limbaugh's talked to Congress folks that are saying they're trying to get top generals to lead a coup.
[00:49:48.071 --> 00:49:49.173]  I mean, that's illegal.
[00:49:49.713 --> 00:49:54.956]  So we sit here and joke about this, but we've got leftists threatening Paul Watson saying, we're going to purge you soon.
[00:49:55.336 --> 00:49:56.537]  We're going to kill you soon.
[00:49:56.917 --> 00:49:59.678]  And then Twitter promotes them saying they're going to kill us.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:07.523]  I think the bad news is they're throwing everything they have at the legitimately elected president.
[00:50:07.923 --> 00:50:13.386]  The good news is in cultural terms, in big civilizational terms, over decades, that is,
[00:50:13.666 --> 00:50:13.766]  Yes.
[00:50:28.643 --> 00:50:30.604]  You're absolutely right in everything you say about those people.
[00:50:30.924 --> 00:50:33.085]  I've listened to you when you talk about them and you're right about them.
[00:50:33.105 --> 00:50:35.327]  The way you describe it is accurate.
[00:50:35.347 --> 00:50:36.127]  It's exactly what they are.
[00:50:36.207 --> 00:50:44.612]  Swivel-eyed lunatic control freaks who just, you know, who live to legislate other people's behavior, language, dress codes, speech codes, you name it.
[00:50:45.052 --> 00:50:48.593]  Um, this is what these people wake up in the morning working out new, you know, working out.
[00:50:48.613 --> 00:50:49.453]  They're buzzkills!
[00:50:49.653 --> 00:50:52.014]  Yeah, this is what I'm about to say.
[00:50:52.314 --> 00:50:59.056]  They're funless, joyless, this sort of horrible, anodyne, faceless America they want to build.
[00:50:59.096 --> 00:51:03.498]  This kind of, this ugly, joyless hell where no one can tell a joke.
[00:51:03.938 --> 00:51:05.358]  No one can have an interesting or fun.
[00:51:05.458 --> 00:51:07.999]  And the buildings, all they admit, have to be ugly.
[00:51:08.659 --> 00:51:10.820]  Oh, well you can't, nobody can wear a costume.
[00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:12.622]  Nobody can tell a joke.
[00:51:13.143 --> 00:51:15.427]  Nobody can have a particular hairstyle.
[00:51:15.768 --> 00:51:18.993]  Nobody can do or say or be anything.
[00:51:20.034 --> 00:51:22.655]  Except this narrow little band of what they tell you.
[00:51:22.916 --> 00:51:26.117]  And they're always fighting with each other over what that is.
[00:51:26.297 --> 00:51:26.497]  Right.
[00:51:26.637 --> 00:51:28.859]  Isn't that why they're going to go down there fighting with themselves?
[00:51:28.879 --> 00:51:37.243]  Well, it's another mechanism of control requiring you to sign up for a definition that constantly changes because it requires you to always be... it means that you're always in fear.
[00:51:37.643 --> 00:51:40.324]  Because you never know what's going to be racist today.
[00:51:40.444 --> 00:51:41.805]  Because the definition of racist is changing.
[00:51:41.825 --> 00:51:42.846]  They're always moving the goalposts.
[00:51:42.906 --> 00:51:44.026]  And enlarging, exactly.
[00:51:44.286 --> 00:51:45.187]  But this is why they're going to lose.
[00:51:45.227 --> 00:51:47.788]  They're going to lose, in my view, mostly because they're so funless.
[00:51:48.729 --> 00:51:49.109]  Look how much...
[00:51:49.529 --> 00:51:50.669]  Fun we've had on the show today.
[00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:53.891]  Like, we've been laughing, we've been joking, we've been enjoying ourselves.
[00:51:54.151 --> 00:51:55.951]  People at home are enjoying themselves.
[00:51:56.412 --> 00:52:01.493]  Compare that with CNN, with the gloomy, the sad CNN meme, you know?
[00:52:01.774 --> 00:52:10.657]  Like, we managed, like, the sort of populist, nationalist, you know, conservative and libertarian movement managed to find some joy
[00:52:11.477 --> 00:52:16.363]  In what is otherwise a completely funless progressive left establishment.
[00:52:27.137 --> 00:52:28.198]  Well, they're not in power.
[00:52:28.218 --> 00:52:31.321]  It seems to me far-fetched that they're actually going to try to kill the president.
[00:52:31.441 --> 00:52:33.843]  I mean, are they really going to assassinate Trump?
[00:52:34.203 --> 00:52:36.825]  I mean, it seems... That would really blow up in their face.
[00:52:37.165 --> 00:52:38.406]  I can't imagine they'd go that far.
[00:52:38.426 --> 00:52:39.407]  Turn him into a martyr?
[00:52:39.567 --> 00:52:40.028]  Come now.
[00:52:40.748 --> 00:52:44.771]  You know, of all people to turn into a martyr, Donald Trump, you know, would not be a smart choice.
[00:52:48.254 --> 00:52:55.280]  But, look, I really firmly... Yeah, see, if I was Machiavellian, somebody would actually go after Trump to ensure we totally win.
[00:52:56.049 --> 00:52:56.709]  I don't want that to happen.
[00:53:20.456 --> 00:53:21.357]  That far I will go.
[00:53:21.377 --> 00:53:38.327]  And the ways in which they're doing it are dishonest and sneaky and miserable and the commentary is depressing and angry and furious all the time and I really firmly believe that one of the main ways that we have, one of the main tools that we have at our disposal is fun and joy and mischief.
[00:53:38.667 --> 00:53:43.108]  Whether it's the meme-y, troll-y, you know, hordes that carried Trump into the White House.
[00:53:43.388 --> 00:53:45.489]  Or whether it's just enjoying ourselves.
[00:53:45.569 --> 00:53:48.649]  People are attracted to fun, happy people.
[00:53:49.049 --> 00:53:51.650]  And if we can tell the truth... Exactly, and laughing at the left.
[00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:54.151]  If we can tell the truth, but wrap it in a good joke.
[00:53:54.711 --> 00:53:56.891]  If we can be more fun than the other side.
[00:53:56.931 --> 00:53:59.252]  That's why I like your show, because I need to get more.
[00:53:59.272 --> 00:54:00.252]  I mean, I can be funny when I want.
[00:54:00.552 --> 00:54:06.893]  I tend to get so serious because we are in such serious times, but it's important to have some fun sometimes as well.
[00:54:06.913 --> 00:54:11.274]  Before we go any further with some phone calls, again, free shipping was supposed to end yesterday.
[00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:14.015]  I noticed they haven't ended it yet, but the specials did end.
[00:54:14.375 --> 00:54:16.856]  But free shipping, one more day and it is going to end today.
[00:54:17.776 --> 00:54:18.676]  But here are the new specials.
[00:54:18.696 --> 00:54:22.277]  We're having the 1776 specials in the month of August.
[00:54:23.473 --> 00:54:23.833]  We have
[00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:44.251]  55% off, we've never done that, but I want folks to enjoy that.
[00:54:44.271 --> 00:54:45.232]  We just got a big shipment in.
[00:54:45.592 --> 00:54:52.717]  Sheikra 12, pure methylcobalamin, vitamin B12, very absorbable into the body, under the tongue, high quality, 55% off, $17.76.
[00:54:54.118 --> 00:54:55.639]  Oil of oregano, it's $17.76.
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:58.021]  Biotruselenium, it's $17.76.
[00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:05.606]  We have the new Super Blue mouthwash that's made by the same place that makes, you know, the big high quality toothpaste that we have.
[00:55:05.626 --> 00:55:07.908]  It's fluoride free with iodine and colloidal silver.
[00:55:08.328 --> 00:55:09.849]  That has coiled silver in it.
[00:55:10.029 --> 00:55:10.590]  It's $17.76.
[00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:12.131]  That's 11% off out of the gate.
[00:55:12.391 --> 00:55:17.054]  We have the John Oliver Challenge with our bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen mix.
[00:55:17.074 --> 00:55:20.237]  The best-selling bone broth formula in the country now.
[00:55:20.637 --> 00:55:22.018]  Quite a big phenomenon.
[00:55:22.298 --> 00:55:23.099]  That's back in stock.
[00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:25.480]  John Oliver's attacking and saying it's horrible, that it tastes terrible.
[00:55:25.781 --> 00:55:26.781]  It tastes okay with water.
[00:55:26.801 --> 00:55:28.382]  It tastes great with milk and some ice.
[00:55:28.963 --> 00:55:29.923]  But just don't believe me.
[00:55:29.943 --> 00:55:30.564]  Try it for yourself.
[00:55:30.584 --> 00:55:31.885]  But what matters is the energy.
[00:55:32.165 --> 00:55:32.745]  The stamina.
[00:55:32.765 --> 00:55:34.407]  You think a bowl of chicken noodle soup is good.
[00:55:34.687 --> 00:55:36.248]  This is chicken noodle soup squared.
[00:55:36.488 --> 00:55:37.188]  The next power.
[00:55:37.228 --> 00:55:44.914]  That's 30% off when you get it with the new True Whey Protein we have made by the top manufacturer of organic grass-fed whey in the country.

[00:55:48.756 --> 00:55:53.159]  Free shipping for one more day and always 10% off when you sign up for auto ship.
[00:55:53.359 --> 00:55:55.280]  That makes a bunch of these loss leaders.
[00:55:55.641 --> 00:55:56.441]  So new specials.
[00:55:56.501 --> 00:55:57.722]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:55:58.342 --> 00:56:00.044]  The 1776 specials.
[00:56:00.084 --> 00:56:01.064]  Defending our Republic.
[00:56:01.084 --> 00:56:01.945]  Defending free speech.
[00:56:02.205 --> 00:56:02.545]  Milo.
[00:56:02.886 --> 00:56:07.169]  I wasn't going to go back to this, but I was just looking at the pictures before I actually started reading it.
[00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:09.511]  Madeleine Albright's a good looking man.
[00:56:11.672 --> 00:56:16.196]  The baboons weren't interested, but Hillary Rodham Clinton was warming to her subject.
[00:56:16.736 --> 00:56:18.137]  Well, even the monkeys don't care.
[00:56:18.818 --> 00:56:30.667]  While a couple of primates watched from a nearby boulder, more taken by the remnants of a lavish picnic than their high-profile visitor, the First Lady delivered an exegesis on women's advancement.
[00:56:32.999 --> 00:56:33.840]  It's all there!
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.401]  But what it's saying archivally is she's a god.
[00:56:36.661 --> 00:56:38.482]  Speaking to the sub-humans.
[00:56:39.142 --> 00:56:46.946]  But isn't it interesting, I mean, if you take the... It's all about how they're scientific and they're like aliens visiting a foreign world to see the aboriginal boobies.
[00:56:46.966 --> 00:56:52.369]  But if you take the primates as a proxy for the rest of us, you know, those, you know... Yeah, you get it.
[00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:54.050]  She's a god woman.
[00:56:54.070 --> 00:57:01.775]  The deplorables, you know, those of us who are messy and scrappy and, you know, we are ungratefully ignoring her.
[00:57:01.795 --> 00:57:03.716]  We're not the transcendent Madam President.
[00:57:03.756 --> 00:57:06.198]  Her sermon on the mount about women's empowerment.
[00:57:06.238 --> 00:57:10.740]  Well, that's a pretty good metaphor, it's a pretty good allegory for what happened in the election, isn't it?
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:14.983]  The rest of us, she was banging on about women and the rest of us just weren't that interested.
[00:57:15.003 --> 00:57:16.544]  We were more interested in the picnic.
[00:57:18.803 --> 00:57:22.205]  And we were more interested, women were more interested just in having a good life.
[00:57:22.666 --> 00:57:25.107]  I just, I mean I was only taking the mickey out of the pictures before.
[00:57:25.127 --> 00:57:27.589]  Well a creepy woman telling women how much she loves them.
[00:57:27.609 --> 00:57:30.591]  Now I've actually started reading it, it's even better.
[00:57:30.631 --> 00:57:31.091]  I told you!
[00:57:31.111 --> 00:57:31.992]  You've got to get this.
[00:57:32.012 --> 00:57:33.653]  You could write a whole book about this.
[00:57:33.913 --> 00:57:34.913]  Oh, you've got to get this on eBay.
[00:57:34.933 --> 00:57:38.716]  Since I started plugging it, it's gone from like $4 on... On eBay to like $50, yeah.
[00:57:38.756 --> 00:57:39.196]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:57:39.316 --> 00:57:40.897]  Because I want to republish this.
[00:57:40.937 --> 00:57:47.882]  Well if you'd been smart you would have bought 5,000 of them and then start driving the price up on the sh... Well maybe I've let, ooh, maybe I've let people into your secret.
[00:57:48.402 --> 00:57:49.363]  It's actually going on.
[00:57:49.383 --> 00:57:52.806]  I actually have been trying to corner the market on the Madam President.
[00:57:55.508 --> 00:57:57.409]  The most unintentional comedy in the galaxy.
[00:57:57.509 --> 00:57:59.991]  In fact, give that back!
[00:58:00.292 --> 00:58:02.554]  You can have the right whistle, but you can't have that!
[00:58:02.774 --> 00:58:05.016]  This is a dilemma I've got in front of me.
[00:58:05.656 --> 00:58:06.277]  You know what?
[00:58:06.397 --> 00:58:07.317]  I've already ordered more.
[00:58:07.718 --> 00:58:08.538]  You may have it.
[00:58:08.638 --> 00:58:09.920]  It's a show on C-SPAN.
[00:58:11.115 --> 00:58:12.316]  Promise you will and I'll give it to you.
[00:58:12.336 --> 00:58:17.240]  This is a rape whistle blown by Alex Jones or the Madam President Newsweek special.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.002]  If I only got to pick one, I don't think I'd be able to choose.
[00:58:20.022 --> 00:58:21.423]  I don't think I'd be able to choose.
[00:58:21.463 --> 00:58:22.144]  I'm taking both.
[00:58:22.905 --> 00:58:24.946]  You can actually, but promise you'll show it on C-SPAN.
[00:58:25.227 --> 00:58:26.047]  I'll promise to try.
[00:58:26.067 --> 00:58:27.428]  Because they're going to get really mad.
[00:58:27.468 --> 00:58:34.874]  Maybe what I'll do is I'll take a purple folder and I'll say it's my notes and I'll produce it and just say, well, one of the reasons I wrote the book is things like this.
[00:58:39.069 --> 00:58:41.072]  This will be a day long remembered.
[00:58:41.172 --> 00:58:42.033]  I hope it's live.
[00:58:42.633 --> 00:58:44.576]  If it was, now we've given it away, but they don't watch this show.
[00:58:45.797 --> 00:58:46.878]  That's it for tonight's news.
[00:58:46.918 --> 00:58:47.899]  Thank you for joining us.
