[00:00:06.158 --> 00:00:10.219]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:19.202]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:27.325]  Ladies and gentlemen, wow, to watch the death of MSM, to watch them kind of explode on the Death Star is amazing.
[00:00:28.658 --> 00:00:33.664]  I used the analogy last week of like a light bulb before it goes out will shine a little bit brighter.
[00:00:33.664 --> 00:00:41.653]  They are 5% of their previous audience just 30 years ago, but they still are able to cause dissension.
[00:00:41.653 --> 00:00:47.359]  We're going to break all that down, but first, a report about the liberal impeachment rally goes nowhere.
[00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:47.720]  Here it is.
[00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:49.911]  USA!

[00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:11.919]  USA!
[00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:12.119]  USA!
[00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:12.379]  USA!

[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.820]  USA!
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.940]  USA!
[00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.060]  USA!

[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.400]  USA!
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.600]  USA!
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.860]  USA!
[00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.960]  USA!
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.120]  USA!
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.260]  USA!
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.460]  USA!
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.720]  USA!
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.860]  USA!
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.960]  USA!
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.161]  USA!
[00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:17.481]  USA!
[00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:17.721]  USA!
[00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:18.041]  USA!
[00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:18.301]  USA!
[00:01:19.105 --> 00:01:21.328]  Why is he a traitor?
[00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:25.995]  He so much as admitted collusion with Poop on the election.
[00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:29.168]  Any other reasons?
[00:01:29.168 --> 00:01:31.309]  Well, I mean, he's lied to the public.
[00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:40.154]  Not that that's necessarily impeachable, but I think it all adds up to a serious indictment of his presidency.
[00:01:40.154 --> 00:01:46.818]  Their cry-bully tactics, led by Texas Representative Al Green, failed in every aspect.
[00:01:46.818 --> 00:01:54.822]  When I announced that I was going to bring impeachment articles against the president,
[00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:01.143]  There were some people who made ugly comments.
[00:02:01.143 --> 00:02:04.187]  People have threatened my life.
[00:02:04.187 --> 00:02:12.998]  But I want to assure you that no amount of intimidation, no amount of threats, nobody will stop this movement.
[00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:14.600]  We will march on.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:29.244]  It's about the fact that in the richest country in the world, no one should work full time and live below the poverty line!
[00:02:29.244 --> 00:02:35.146]  In the United States of America, every person ought to have healthcare!
[00:02:35.146 --> 00:02:40.548]  But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
[00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:44.349]  If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor.
[00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.649]  Period.
[00:02:46.793 --> 00:02:57.060]  But for the average person, many folks who don't have health insurance initially, they're going to have to make some choices and they might end up having to switch doctors.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.302]  How in the world can this be HIPAA compliant?
[00:03:01.302 --> 00:03:13.990]  HIPAA is designed to protect the patient's privacy and this explicitly says in order to continue you have to accept this condition that you have no privacy or no reasonable expectation of privacy.
[00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.392]  Three different people were given access to her account, her address, and her social security number.
[00:03:19.787 --> 00:03:21.728]  Let us organize in local communities!
[00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:58.188]  Let us go to our churches, our civic clubs, and let us let others know that in this country, no one is above the law.
[00:03:58.188 --> 00:04:02.552]  And when you're above the law, the people will demand your impeachment.
[00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:03.853]  God bless you.
[00:04:03.853 --> 00:04:09.778]  God bless the United States of America.
[00:04:09.778 --> 00:04:13.761]  God bless America, land that I love.

[00:04:40.276 --> 00:04:54.782]  What does it say, liberals, when the seditious George Soros-paid Antifa group's uncharacteristic absence reveals that your numbers are as non-existent as any valid argument you may have had for impeachment?
[00:04:54.782 --> 00:04:57.103]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:04:57.103 --> 00:04:57.883]  Get ready, folks.
[00:04:59.482 --> 00:05:04.066]  The New York Times ran the headline, Central Americans scared of what's happening in U.S.
[00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:04.987]  staying put.
[00:05:04.987 --> 00:05:10.031]  This has been a popular talking point of the left, aimed at demonizing President Trump's strong border policy.
[00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:19.238]  But think about the paradigm here, implying that somehow it is a bad thing that people aren't rushing to our country in droves because it's not easy to get in and reside here illegally anymore.
[00:05:19.238 --> 00:05:24.983]  The same people implying this also stress the hardship of poor people, specifically citing health care.
[00:05:24.983 --> 00:05:28.686]  Well then how is more people here that are in need going to help that problem?
[00:05:28.866 --> 00:05:35.768]  So the Democrats complain all day about how we don't have enough welfare for Americans, yet they want to take more people in here that need welfare.
[00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:39.609]  But really all President Trump is doing is enforcing border security and law.
[00:05:39.609 --> 00:05:42.189]  But since when is it just free for anyone to come here?
[00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.350]  Since when is America supposed to have open doors for anyone?
[00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.571]  I don't see anyone from North America rushing to get into Central America.
[00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:49.451]  You know why?
[00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:51.391]  Because you couldn't, and it's better here.
[00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:53.252]  This all equates to one thing.
[00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:55.992]  More Democrats losing in upcoming elections.
[00:05:55.992 --> 00:05:58.253]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:06:00.385 --> 00:06:04.190]  MycoZx is back in after five plus months sold out.
[00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.692]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[00:06:05.692 --> 00:06:07.415]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[00:06:07.415 --> 00:06:09.858]  Latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[00:06:09.858 --> 00:06:11.039]  It's been sold out for months.
[00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:11.941]  Big waiting list.
[00:06:11.941 --> 00:06:15.666]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:16.627]  Nobody's got something this
[00:06:16.927 --> 00:06:23.975]  Save 30% off of MycoZx and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 billion live in each pill.
[00:06:23.975 --> 00:06:31.843]  Probiotic MycoZx contains 7 of the world's most powerful organic and wild crafted ingredients designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:06:31.843 --> 00:06:37.670]  Start fighting back against hidden yeast and fungus with MycoZx and ForageLife.com before it sells out again.
[00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.211]  10% off when you choose auto ship.
[00:06:40.211 --> 00:06:46.074]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist years ago.
[00:06:46.074 --> 00:06:46.654]  Now it's epidemic.
[00:06:46.654 --> 00:06:49.616]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them.
[00:06:49.616 --> 00:06:52.037]  Because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:55.119]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or AAA2533139.
[00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:08.468]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar, a 360 win.
[00:07:08.468 --> 00:07:15.034]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[00:07:15.034 --> 00:07:22.561]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip, because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:28.044]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:07:28.044 --> 00:07:34.128]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:07:34.128 --> 00:07:41.932]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:07:41.932 --> 00:07:49.136]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:49.937]  10% off on auto ship.
[00:07:50.097 --> 00:07:52.539]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:54.520]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.363]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:20.092]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:20.092 --> 00:08:25.715]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.715 --> 00:08:35.861]  Well, this weekend... This weekend, ladies and gentlemen...
[00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:49.877]  They sent the old antifa folks, the anti-fascists, who really are the fascists, out in mass, Soros-funded, to try to physically assault people and shut down free speech.
[00:08:49.877 --> 00:08:56.500]  But patriots all over the United States were there backing their faces and outnumbered them.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:03.344]  From the videos I've seen in New York and Austin, Texas and California, Los Angeles, were 5 to 1, 10 to 1, 15 to 1.
[00:09:05.345 --> 00:09:11.591]  There's a report by John Bowne up on Infowars.com that breaks all of that down.
[00:09:11.591 --> 00:09:12.792]  Where to start?
[00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:29.828]  First off, I want to open the phones up today, here on July 3rd, 2017, on this Monday edition, and I want to walk through the unmitigated, delusional deception that we have seen
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.103]  From the controlled corporate dinosaur press.
[00:09:35.103 --> 00:09:37.725]  It is simply incredible.
[00:09:37.725 --> 00:09:57.220]  Over the weekend, Trump tweets out, I guess late Saturday night, a video graphic that had been out for days on Reddit, a composite of his famous WWE appearance, where he
[00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:08.062]  Smacks down in theater, it's not real, Vince McMahon, who's one of his personal friends, another fellow Republican.
[00:10:08.062 --> 00:10:14.604]  Someone stuck a CNN logo over Vince McMahon's head and then Trump beats him down.
[00:10:14.604 --> 00:10:17.905]  Trump retweets this, it's obviously a joke, it's theater.
[00:10:19.841 --> 00:10:21.462]  WWE is theater.
[00:10:21.462 --> 00:10:22.302]  This is well known.
[00:10:22.302 --> 00:10:25.784]  It's nothing compared to Kathy Griffin simulating cutting his head off.
[00:10:25.784 --> 00:10:34.987]  It's nothing compared to Time Warner and CNN financing a play where Trump is killed Julius Caesar style.
[00:10:34.987 --> 00:10:40.209]  Or the New York Times or the Washington Post editorialists saying someone needs to kill Trump.
[00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:43.531]  Or the BBC, the London Guardian, praising the young British man that went to
[00:10:44.522 --> 00:10:48.304]  Nevada to a rally and grabbed the gun away from the officer and tried to kill him.
[00:10:48.304 --> 00:10:56.668]  I mean there has been such a cacophony, such a crescendo, such a symphony of calling for violence against Trump and his supporters.
[00:10:56.668 --> 00:11:05.973]  And WikiLeaks where we catch Hillary financing groups to go violently attack Trump supporters dressed as Bernie supporters.
[00:11:05.973 --> 00:11:10.415]  That way her enemy Bernie gets discredited and that way Trump gets discredited.
[00:11:14.511 --> 00:11:23.273]  They are completely and totally out of control beating war drums 24-7.
[00:11:23.273 --> 00:11:32.895]  And then Trump tweets out a clear joke and Keith Olbermann climbs out from under his failed rock and calls for Trump's impeachment.
[00:11:32.895 --> 00:11:38.317]  Bernstein comes out and says top military leaders are questioning Trump.
[00:11:38.317 --> 00:11:40.897]  That's coup talk.
[00:11:40.897 --> 00:11:43.798]  We have CNN saying it's an incitement to violence.
[00:11:45.131 --> 00:11:49.777]  We have senators coming out saying that he's weaponized distrust.
[00:11:49.777 --> 00:11:54.783]  No, you have made us distrust you, MSM.
[00:11:54.783 --> 00:11:56.405]  Now, if you look at MSM numbers...
[00:11:57.346 --> 00:12:00.928]  They're down over 90% in the last 20 years or so.
[00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:05.409]  They've kind of had a dead cat bounce the last two years because this is a real election.
[00:12:05.409 --> 00:12:07.790]  This is a real resurrection of America.
[00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.551]  This is a real president.
[00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:13.113]  Whether you agree with some of his policies or not, he really is calling the shots.
[00:12:13.113 --> 00:12:14.613]  He really is his own man.
[00:12:14.613 --> 00:12:17.755]  He really has fired every lobbyist for the first time ever.
[00:12:17.755 --> 00:12:18.455]  Nobody's done that.
[00:12:19.636 --> 00:12:31.883]  He really has caused confidence in all this new money in the stock market, and 300 billion in new jobs, and thousands of companies announcing they're coming back, and he really is going against the tide of global consolidation and collapse.
[00:12:31.883 --> 00:12:32.704]  Can he win?
[00:12:32.704 --> 00:12:33.564]  Can we win?
[00:12:33.564 --> 00:12:35.185]  That's up to us.
[00:12:35.185 --> 00:12:36.686]  And up to God and our prayers.
[00:12:36.686 --> 00:12:38.928]  And our action.
[00:12:38.928 --> 00:12:45.292]  But the special interests that have hijacked this nation and much of the world, who believe they own us, they are having conniption fits.
[00:12:46.212 --> 00:12:50.993]  And they are beating the war drums steadily, steadily, steadily.
[00:12:50.993 --> 00:12:52.853]  They get more frantic.
[00:12:52.853 --> 00:12:57.714]  They are now in total hissy fit.
[00:12:57.714 --> 00:13:04.336]  And they are out there attacking people, and they are out there burning things, and they are out there overturning police cars, and shooting cops in the back.
[00:13:04.336 --> 00:13:10.157]  I mean, everybody knows what they're pushing, and what they're doing, and what they're saying.
[00:13:10.157 --> 00:13:14.898]  From Madonna saying, blow up the White House, to Mickey Rourke saying, you know, he wants to kill Trump.
[00:13:15.717 --> 00:13:23.025]  To just all of it, it is a non-ending crescendo.
[00:13:23.025 --> 00:13:38.180]  They're trying to get the libertarian, right-wing, Americana movement, that's a very diverse group of people that just want prosperity and freedom and don't want to be Venezuela, don't want to be North Korea, they're trying to get us into violent action.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:38.941]  They're failing.
[00:13:41.636 --> 00:13:43.617]  And so now they're going into hysteria mode.
[00:13:43.617 --> 00:13:44.678]  Now why did Trump tweet this?
[00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:45.398]  Was he right to do it?
[00:13:45.398 --> 00:13:46.238]  Absolutely.
[00:13:46.238 --> 00:13:48.620]  They're the ones calling for stabbing him to death.
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.641]  They're the ones calling for chopping his head off.
[00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:56.024]  They're the ones turning universities into total brainwashing camps where no whites are allowed.
[00:13:56.024 --> 00:13:59.926]  I mean, I see like 10 articles a day in my stacks that I don't even get to.
[00:14:00.731 --> 00:14:05.314]  Where top professors are saying no white should be allowed on campus.
[00:14:05.314 --> 00:14:06.735]  Whites are inherently evil.
[00:14:06.735 --> 00:14:08.277]  All whites should be killed.
[00:14:08.277 --> 00:14:11.039]  If you have a white baby in your uterus, kill it.
[00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:12.720]  Whites are inherently the problem.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:21.166]  This is the norm on these insane asylums that have been set up by the government in its move to create balkanization.
[00:14:21.166 --> 00:14:24.028]  And a segregated society now.
[00:14:24.028 --> 00:14:25.129]  That's what they're doing.
[00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:26.350]  Politically segregated.
[00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:42.172]  And so they can then create such racial fervor and bullying that if you don't totally submit to what the latest political correctness is on a week-by-week basis, the latest download, you will be demonized, you will be ostracized.
[00:14:42.172 --> 00:14:50.059]  You don't just think they have Rachel Maddow and Tom Brokaw and all these other people on the news with no proof calling me deeply racist for no reason.
[00:14:52.409 --> 00:14:53.611]  Of course there's no proof.
[00:14:53.611 --> 00:14:54.352]  They don't care.
[00:14:54.352 --> 00:14:58.819]  The message is we will call you anathema.
[00:14:58.819 --> 00:15:00.241]  We will call you a heretic.
[00:15:00.241 --> 00:15:02.164]  We will call you a devil worshipper.
[00:15:02.164 --> 00:15:03.546]  We will call you a witch.
[00:15:03.546 --> 00:15:03.927]  A witch!
[00:15:03.927 --> 00:15:04.287]  A witch!
[00:15:04.287 --> 00:15:05.008]  A witch!
[00:15:05.008 --> 00:15:06.290]  Like a Monty Python skit.
[00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.951]  Well, here's the news.
[00:15:09.065 --> 00:15:11.387]  I don't care if you call me a witch or a heretic.
[00:15:11.387 --> 00:15:12.469]  I'm not.
[00:15:12.469 --> 00:15:15.512]  I don't care if you use your magic word, racism.
[00:15:15.512 --> 00:15:20.056]  First they weaponize the n-word and create pain and division with it.
[00:15:20.056 --> 00:15:30.087]  Then they can move on to every other word and ban family or mother or father that's banned on entrance forms at almost all public schools in the United States.
[00:15:32.392 --> 00:15:36.613]  See how far they've taken us with the brainwashing.
[00:15:36.613 --> 00:15:37.914]  See what they've done.
[00:15:37.914 --> 00:15:39.734]  But Trump's only getting more hardcore.
[00:15:39.734 --> 00:15:41.015]  In fact, scroll back down.
[00:15:41.015 --> 00:15:44.496]  Let me read some more of these tweets that the media can't stand.
[00:15:44.496 --> 00:15:47.097]  My use of social media is not presidential.
[00:15:47.097 --> 00:15:49.017]  It's modern-day presidential.
[00:15:49.017 --> 00:15:50.458]  Make America great again.
[00:15:50.458 --> 00:15:51.238]  That's right.
[00:15:51.238 --> 00:15:57.860]  Trump's breaking with the controlled, sequestered systems where the president is held captive by the bureaucracy.
[00:16:00.094 --> 00:16:01.775]  They're saying things like, what is Trump going to do?
[00:16:01.775 --> 00:16:06.479]  We can't let him talk to Putin alone, even though that's normal for presidents to do.
[00:16:06.479 --> 00:16:09.221]  Why, he's a traitor if he does.
[00:16:09.221 --> 00:16:14.846]  He also said, I'm the president and they're not.
[00:16:14.846 --> 00:16:17.048]  Attacks media at Faith Rally.
[00:16:17.048 --> 00:16:19.790]  We're going to play it all today.
[00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.612]  But first off, here is the audio and video.
[00:16:23.746 --> 00:16:30.570]  of Trump and the supposed smackdown that has them calling for Trump's head yet again.
[00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:45.840]  How dare you when we call for your death systematically and try to organize it and when a congressman and cops get shot and how dare you when CNN says this guy wasn't evil that shot the congressman's police and how dare everybody say the young man that tried to kill Trump's a hero.
[00:16:47.185 --> 00:16:54.048]  On and on and on, and then he retweets out somebody's joke where he slams CNN.
[00:16:54.048 --> 00:16:55.949]  They've declared war.
[00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:57.170]  He jokes back.
[00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.430]  It's like Kathy Griffin.
[00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:02.392]  He says, you know, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, simulating my murder and upset my son.
[00:17:02.392 --> 00:17:05.373]  She goes, he hurt me.
[00:17:05.373 --> 00:17:07.754]  He crushed me.
[00:17:07.754 --> 00:17:10.176]  It's like the fakest crying I've ever seen.
[00:17:10.176 --> 00:17:14.898]  Like when you catch the four year old with the whole box of crackers or the whole box of
[00:17:15.638 --> 00:17:20.541]  Candy or the whole box or whatever they've grabbed and drug under their bed, and they're eating it, you know, before dinner.
[00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:26.984]  And they talk, Mommy, I'm sorry we don't.
[00:17:26.984 --> 00:17:35.529]  It's so bizarre to see how delusional they are that we don't see how hypocritical it is when you run around saying murder everybody 24-7.
[00:17:35.529 --> 00:17:36.289]  Kill everybody.
[00:17:40.014 --> 00:17:48.679]  That you disagree with, call them all these horrible names, call them Hitler, call them, you know, the KKK, and then they can't even have a joke.
[00:17:48.679 --> 00:17:49.280]  Here's that video.
[00:17:58.055 --> 00:18:01.217]  Very exciting video, as you can see, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:01.217 --> 00:18:07.400]  It's a miracle our computers don't crash more often, but this is one we're going to play today.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.642]  Not just behind me, but you can bet when we come back from break, we're going to come in and we're going to air it.
[00:18:11.642 --> 00:18:21.548]  It's just like 15, 20 seconds of crowd cheering and YouTube video of, again, this horrible incitement to racism.
[00:18:21.548 --> 00:18:21.808]  Here it is.
[00:18:39.011 --> 00:18:41.534]  Again, if you're a radio listener, you've probably already seen this clip.
[00:18:41.534 --> 00:18:42.975]  The clip's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:18:42.975 --> 00:18:45.058]  It's been out since Saturday night, but let me just stop there.
[00:18:46.957 --> 00:18:54.899]  When we come back, I'm going to play the original Vince McMahon, where Trump is shaving his head and much more, just so folks have context.
[00:18:54.899 --> 00:19:09.542]  But this shows where our country's gotten to, that there now have 20-plus Democrats signed on to begin impeachment proceedings of President Trump, and they're adding to the reason why that he's inciting violence when they're the ones calling for Trump's head.
[00:19:09.542 --> 00:19:15.143]  Again, this is the incredible, total, and almost complete hypocriticalness
[00:19:16.556 --> 00:19:25.043]  of these individuals that we're dealing with and we have to continue to just laugh at them and let them know we understand you're the fake news.
[00:19:25.043 --> 00:19:34.110]  I mean just the New York Times last week had to admit 17 agencies didn't unanimously agree that Trump was working with the Russians or the Russians mess with our elections.
[00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.532]  Turns out it's all a fraud.
[00:19:35.532 --> 00:19:40.956]  Just like every scientist unanimously agreed with the UN about climate change being man-made.
[00:19:40.956 --> 00:19:42.437]  None of that was true.
[00:19:42.437 --> 00:19:44.299]  Or global warming being man-made.
[00:19:45.521 --> 00:19:47.203]  None of it's true.
[00:19:47.203 --> 00:19:47.804]  They lie.
[00:19:47.804 --> 00:19:57.217]  They're having to retract every few hours now all these stories because they're a pack of lying scum that have all agreed to get together and double down their fraud.
[00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:04.196]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:20:04.196 --> 00:20:09.899]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:20:09.899 --> 00:20:15.102]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[00:20:15.102 --> 00:20:17.043]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[00:20:17.043 --> 00:20:19.445]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[00:20:19.445 --> 00:20:20.385]  See guidelines.
[00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:23.667]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:25.608]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:20:25.608 --> 00:20:27.169]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:20:28.826 --> 00:20:30.727]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:20:30.727 --> 00:20:33.949]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[00:20:33.949 --> 00:20:35.551]  Savory and delicious.
[00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:38.372]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:20:38.372 --> 00:20:39.053]  Awesome.
[00:20:39.053 --> 00:20:42.135]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[00:20:42.135 --> 00:20:43.696]  NASA PAC Technology.
[00:20:43.696 --> 00:20:44.316]  Bacon.
[00:20:44.316 --> 00:20:48.479]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[00:20:48.479 --> 00:20:49.920]  Or warm and served.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.962]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:20:51.962 --> 00:20:53.903]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[00:20:59.042 --> 00:21:01.023]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:21:01.023 --> 00:21:06.324]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:21:06.324 --> 00:21:07.904]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:21:07.904 --> 00:21:16.266]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:21:16.266 --> 00:21:21.948]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:21:22.128 --> 00:21:23.950]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.112]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:21:26.112 --> 00:21:30.637]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:21:30.637 --> 00:21:32.820]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:21:58.525 --> 00:22:02.806]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[00:22:02.806 --> 00:22:10.769]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[00:22:10.769 --> 00:22:13.790]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.791]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[00:22:17.791 --> 00:22:20.472]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[00:22:20.472 --> 00:22:24.133]  It's by using the amazing Home Freeze Dryer from Harvest Right.
[00:22:24.813 --> 00:22:28.818]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[00:22:28.818 --> 00:22:34.045]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[00:22:34.045 --> 00:22:39.873]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting food on hand.
[00:22:39.873 --> 00:22:42.696]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[00:22:43.197 --> 00:22:44.919]  We love our freeze dryer.

[00:22:57.785 --> 00:22:59.046]  Maybe not today.
[00:22:59.046 --> 00:23:00.346]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[00:23:00.346 --> 00:23:04.088]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[00:23:04.088 --> 00:23:05.168]  Forget bunkers.
[00:23:05.168 --> 00:23:06.989]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[00:23:06.989 --> 00:23:08.690]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[00:24:13.068 --> 00:24:16.677]  Ladies and gentlemen, life is but a dream, isn't it?
[00:24:16.677 --> 00:24:20.447]  Here we are broadcasting worldwide, but a dream is vision.
[00:24:22.082 --> 00:24:28.046]  And life is reality, and God created it all, and if we work hard enough and stay focused, we can build pretty much anything.
[00:24:28.046 --> 00:24:31.888]  That's God's promise back in Genesis, and you now see it's true.
[00:24:31.888 --> 00:24:36.471]  Look at what we've done on this planet, and imagine the potential of where we can go.
[00:24:36.471 --> 00:24:38.192]  I think the answer is clear.
[00:24:38.192 --> 00:24:39.473]  It's unimaginable.
[00:24:39.473 --> 00:24:40.973]  It's unfathomable.
[00:24:40.973 --> 00:24:46.517]  Just as the Bible again says, the eye has not seen, the ear has not heard what God has in store for us all.
[00:24:48.015 --> 00:24:51.658]  I'm a little frustrated because I've been on air for a few days.
[00:24:51.658 --> 00:24:53.240]  I'm super pent up.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.382]  I have so much news to get to.
[00:24:55.382 --> 00:24:57.124]  Next segment, I'm going to cover it all.
[00:24:57.124 --> 00:24:58.825]  It is just incredible.
[00:24:58.825 --> 00:25:04.250]  The revelations of fake news, the preparations for violence against the American people.
[00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:08.134]  You don't just think they're going to overthrow Trump and then leave us alone, do you?
[00:25:08.134 --> 00:25:09.936]  This is a total fight.
[00:25:11.587 --> 00:25:18.253]  And I was so pleased to see videos from all over the country, including videos that our reporters shot in two different cities.
[00:25:18.253 --> 00:25:31.005]  And the reports are on Infowars.com, showing 5 to 1, 10 to 1 patriots out on the streets, peacefully against the Antifa and the Black Lives Matter George Soros cop-killing scum.
[00:25:33.234 --> 00:25:34.515]  Now does that mean the cops are perfect?
[00:25:34.515 --> 00:25:35.175]  Absolutely not.
[00:25:35.175 --> 00:25:37.216]  But Soros is scum.
[00:25:37.216 --> 00:25:38.576]  His supporters are scum.
[00:25:38.576 --> 00:25:39.537]  I've been around them.
[00:25:39.537 --> 00:25:41.318]  They can hardly talk coherently.
[00:25:41.318 --> 00:25:44.459]  We're going to play some of these reports from Owen Schroyer coming up.
[00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:48.041]  These people literally are the trash of the planet.
[00:25:48.041 --> 00:25:51.763]  Now coming up in the next segment, here's just an example of what's coming up.
[00:25:51.763 --> 00:25:53.964]  This just broke on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.761]  Daria found it.
[00:25:56.761 --> 00:25:58.923]  Kit Daniels had a story on it.
[00:25:58.923 --> 00:26:01.264]  This is what we're talking about coming up.
[00:26:01.264 --> 00:26:05.407]  History Channel tweets George Washington fighting at Gettysburg.
[00:26:05.407 --> 00:26:07.329]  Fake news!
[00:26:07.329 --> 00:26:16.115]  History Channel tweeted out a picture of George Washington to celebrate the Battle of Gettysburg 1868.
[00:26:16.115 --> 00:26:18.776]  Isn't that just amazing, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:26:18.776 --> 00:26:20.898]  This shows how there's just a general breakdown
[00:26:23.513 --> 00:26:27.098]  In the low information of voters, but it gets more amazing.
[00:26:27.098 --> 00:26:29.942]  Remember our report?
[00:26:29.942 --> 00:26:32.345]  From June 19th, last month?
[00:26:34.289 --> 00:26:37.372]  More wildlife fish are experiencing intersex.
[00:26:37.372 --> 00:26:38.593]  What could be causing this?
[00:26:38.593 --> 00:26:39.874]  Estrogen mimickers?
[00:26:39.874 --> 00:26:41.275]  This is our report.
[00:26:41.275 --> 00:26:42.336]  What's in the news today?
[00:26:42.336 --> 00:26:43.917]  London Telegraph.
[00:26:43.917 --> 00:26:49.922]  Fish becoming transgender from contraceptive pill chemicals being flushed down household drains.
[00:26:49.922 --> 00:26:51.743]  So are frogs.
[00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:53.945]  Might have heard that somewhere before.
[00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:56.567]  The point is, we went off the U.S.
[00:26:56.567 --> 00:26:58.809]  Geological Survey on the Fish and Wildlife.
[00:27:00.347 --> 00:27:01.627]  Agency.
[00:27:01.627 --> 00:27:03.868]  We just get stuff directly from the agencies.
[00:27:03.868 --> 00:27:06.509]  Nine times out of ten or more often.
[00:27:06.509 --> 00:27:09.910]  You know who told us fluoride was causing brain damage?
[00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:11.311]  The EPA.
[00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:12.631]  They're scientists.
[00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:14.012]  Almost unanimously.
[00:27:14.012 --> 00:27:14.852]  A few didn't sign on.
[00:27:15.882 --> 00:27:22.904]  In the 80s, the 90s, and again in the 2000s, three separate times, they sent letters to their boss saying, take it out, take it out.
[00:27:22.904 --> 00:27:24.285]  It's hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:27:24.285 --> 00:27:25.605]  It's not calcium fluoride.
[00:27:25.605 --> 00:27:26.665]  It's deadly poison.
[00:27:26.665 --> 00:27:27.766]  It's an adjuvant.
[00:27:27.766 --> 00:27:31.627]  It makes every other drug in the water work many, many times more stronger.
[00:27:31.627 --> 00:27:32.267]  Get it out.
[00:27:32.267 --> 00:27:32.947]  Get it out.
[00:27:32.947 --> 00:27:33.567]  Get it out.
[00:27:33.567 --> 00:27:34.488]  Here's Harvard studies.
[00:27:34.488 --> 00:27:35.108]  Here's everything.
[00:27:35.108 --> 00:27:37.249]  But what do they do?
[00:27:37.249 --> 00:27:41.190]  They just say we're complete liars and scum.
[00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:42.910]  I have this directly from Fish and Wildlife.
[00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:43.611]  We publish it.
[00:27:43.611 --> 00:27:44.271]  Infowars.com.
[00:27:46.397 --> 00:27:51.018]  Mike Barrett, we broke this.
[00:27:51.018 --> 00:27:53.979]  A week and a half later, it's all over the news.
[00:27:53.979 --> 00:27:56.160]  We are forcing this out.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:02.641]  With the scientists who put out the reports, we pick up their direct reports, directly from government.
[00:28:02.641 --> 00:28:05.342]  Put it directly out to you, and they say it doesn't exist.
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:11.524]  But see, they can't hold it back anymore because we have such a powerful hit because of you.
[00:28:11.524 --> 00:28:13.386]  You are the punching power of Infowars.
[00:28:13.386 --> 00:28:16.949]  When you tweet articles, when you get articles out, when you get videos out, it's all coming up.
[00:28:16.949 --> 00:28:23.835]  I'm going to finish up with Trump and the demonizations of him and the attempts to shut him down and where this is going and how Soros is trying to start a civil war.
[00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:25.816]  It's all coming up at the start of the next segment.
[00:28:25.816 --> 00:28:27.558]  Then I'm getting in to the huge news.
[00:28:29.465 --> 00:28:33.150]  First off, though, briefly, we're totally listener-supported.
[00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:47.427]  I've decided to extend free shipping throughout InfoWarStore.com throughout the month of July to celebrate the birth of this country and the fact that we're kicking off the second American Revolution and InfoWar against Soros and the globalist violent attempts.
[00:28:48.305 --> 00:28:55.593]  They're trying to frame us for the violence right now, and brand us for the violence that everybody knows they've been gearing up for, but they think you're that stupid.
[00:28:55.593 --> 00:28:59.837]  They're trying the mind game to blame Trump, and Infowars, and yours truly, and others.
[00:28:59.837 --> 00:29:01.559]  Not going to work.
[00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:03.841]  They blame Trump for Scalise getting shot.
[00:29:03.841 --> 00:29:05.223]  No, that was the libtard did that.
[00:29:06.476 --> 00:29:10.177]  But I am extending the 4th of July special at least a few weeks.
[00:29:10.177 --> 00:29:13.078]  A lot of these items are going to sell out so we can't.
[00:29:13.078 --> 00:29:17.160]  The MycoZx antifungal probiotic is amazing.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.281]  Anti-candida, yeast, you name it.
[00:29:19.281 --> 00:29:20.901]  It is back in stock.
[00:29:20.901 --> 00:29:22.062]  30% off when you get it.
[00:29:22.062 --> 00:29:25.703]  With our biome defense, 50 million live cultures per pill.
[00:29:25.703 --> 00:29:26.603]  It's amazing.
[00:29:26.603 --> 00:29:28.504]  These two go together like a horse and carriage.
[00:29:29.224 --> 00:29:30.044]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:30.044 --> 00:29:30.965]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.878 --> 00:30:03.322]  President Trump's tweets have sent the Democrats into a tizzy again.
[00:30:03.322 --> 00:30:14.093]  After President Trump ripped Psycho Joe and NoIQ Mika last week, Trump got back on Twitter yesterday and posted a short video of himself beating up another man depicted as a CNN logo.
[00:30:14.093 --> 00:30:14.994]  A total classic.
[00:30:15.214 --> 00:30:26.046]  But the Democrats didn't appreciate Trump's animosity towards the fake news network CNN, and are now drumming up the bill for impeachment based on the 25th Amendment, citing grounds that the President is mentally unfit to serve.
[00:30:26.046 --> 00:30:31.672]  Now, this would require a medical examination, which may come back to bite the Democrats that are calling for it.
[00:30:31.672 --> 00:30:31.933]  You see,
[00:30:32.393 --> 00:30:36.737]  Given a fair examination of the President's health, Trump will pass with flying colors.
[00:30:36.737 --> 00:30:47.548]  But imagine if the tables were turned, and Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders were asked to pass the same test, given the importance of their jobs.
[00:30:47.548 --> 00:30:50.050]  I wonder if they would still be pushing this bill.
[00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.792]  Something tells me they wouldn't be.
[00:30:51.792 --> 00:30:54.515]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[00:30:59.045 --> 00:31:00.866]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:00.866 --> 00:31:02.947]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:02.947 --> 00:31:05.849]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:05.849 --> 00:31:11.913]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:11.913 --> 00:31:21.118]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:31:21.118 --> 00:31:25.961]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[00:31:26.181 --> 00:31:28.643]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:28.643 --> 00:31:36.668]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:36.668 --> 00:31:37.629]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:38.852 --> 00:31:42.214]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:42.214 --> 00:31:46.357]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:46.357 --> 00:31:53.080]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.163]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:59.253 --> 00:32:00.854]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:32:03.435 --> 00:32:10.939]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[00:32:21.585 --> 00:32:29.411]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[00:32:29.411 --> 00:32:39.619]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:32:39.619 --> 00:32:41.680]  And this part is most important.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:48.165]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:32:48.485 --> 00:32:49.906]  That means it's clean.
[00:32:49.906 --> 00:32:51.047]  That means it's pure.
[00:32:51.047 --> 00:32:53.950]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.733]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:32:56.733 --> 00:32:58.414]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:32:58.414 --> 00:33:01.957]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:01.957 --> 00:33:05.761]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:34.166 --> 00:33:58.420]  Okay, if you just joined us, obviously you know the big national controversy is that Trump tweeted Saturday night a little 20-second video where somebody had photoshopped the CNN logo on the head of the owner of WWE, fellow Republican, fellow billionaire, Vince McMahon, who I think is incredibly entertaining.
[00:34:00.552 --> 00:34:03.435]  And it's just that, it's entertainment.
[00:34:03.435 --> 00:34:07.438]  And it shows Trump then going after CNN.
[00:34:07.438 --> 00:34:24.973]  Now this is after CNN sponsored Shakespeare in the Park with a clear Donald Trump as the president with American flags, with his wife Melania, you know, a model that looked just like her, talked the same, stabbing him to death with the crowd cheering and yelling with a backdrop of American flags.
[00:34:26.616 --> 00:34:30.917]  So a guy with big orange hair, looks just like Donald Trump, fighting for his life, big celebration.
[00:34:30.917 --> 00:34:35.098]  Kathy Griffin, image of Trump's head chopped off.
[00:34:35.098 --> 00:34:43.061]  Meanwhile, the Democratic Party did back ISIS and Al-Qaeda in the Arab Spring, so it fits together, and they want to bring them into our country.
[00:34:43.061 --> 00:34:55.104]  And then, literally, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of editorialists and writers from the Washington Post, the New York Times, the LA Times, Newsweek, everyone's seen the headline daily.
[00:34:56.468 --> 00:34:59.010]  Reporter for this calls for Trump's death.
[00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.833]  Reporter for that calls for Trump's assassination.
[00:35:02.833 --> 00:35:05.675]  This Hollywood producer says he's going to kill Trump.
[00:35:05.675 --> 00:35:07.316]  On and on and on.
[00:35:07.316 --> 00:35:09.677]  And the big controversy of nothing being done about it.
[00:35:09.677 --> 00:35:16.482]  And Facebook pages about, let's kill Trump with 300,000 likes.
[00:35:16.482 --> 00:35:20.025]  And just deadening silence when he was a candidate.
[00:35:22.489 --> 00:35:28.552]  Right through to where he is now, been in office six and a half months.
[00:35:28.552 --> 00:35:40.019]  And what's crazy is the 401ks, the stocks, the salaries, the hourly pay is all up from what it was two years ago.
[00:35:40.019 --> 00:35:42.440]  The average liberal is making more money.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:47.443]  Liberal media has gone from almost no viewers to coming back and getting some viewers.
[00:35:47.443 --> 00:35:52.166]  And they even admit a lot of it is from Trump, if not all of it.
[00:35:54.028 --> 00:35:56.410]  Making things interesting again.
[00:35:56.410 --> 00:36:00.573]  Boy, I know our listeners doubled last year and we kept most of that doubling.
[00:36:00.573 --> 00:36:04.016]  So they better have gotten some listeners and viewers.
[00:36:04.016 --> 00:36:10.982]  Now remember, they went from 10 million viewers on average on MSNBC a decade ago to one of their big shows having a million.
[00:36:10.982 --> 00:36:15.746]  So they've gone from 100,000, 200,000 per show to half a million, a million.
[00:36:15.746 --> 00:36:19.649]  So there's still shadows of them former selves, but still,
[00:36:20.967 --> 00:36:23.549]  People are tuning back in because the news is interesting.
[00:36:23.549 --> 00:36:25.811]  We knew both parties were controlled previously.
[00:36:25.811 --> 00:36:29.754]  Now we know there's a real fight going on.
[00:36:29.754 --> 00:36:31.235]  And America can't get enough of it.
[00:36:31.235 --> 00:36:34.278]  Because it feels like America's back in the game.
[00:36:34.278 --> 00:36:35.579]  Because we are back in the game.
[00:36:37.571 --> 00:36:39.553]  But I knew this would happen yesterday when I saw it.
[00:36:39.553 --> 00:36:44.777]  In fact, I thought about having our crew put Hillary's head on Vince McMahon, but then they'd say I was threatening Hillary.
[00:36:44.777 --> 00:36:46.398]  I wish no harm against Hillary.
[00:36:46.398 --> 00:36:50.362]  I want to de-escalate the violence, but they're the ones calling for it.
[00:36:50.362 --> 00:36:52.464]  They're the ones calling for resist.
[00:36:52.464 --> 00:37:02.152]  They're the ones pushing and funding the Antifa that's totally lockstep, pushing violence, hitting people over the head with clubs and bike locks and all the rest of it.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.300]  So he knew it was coming.
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.281]  Here's a clip.
[00:37:05.281 --> 00:37:07.122]  I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[00:37:07.122 --> 00:37:18.007]  Someone has now put on the head of the referee from a WWE, where the referee knocks down Trump, all simulated, the Justice Department seal.
[00:37:18.007 --> 00:37:22.188]  So again, will this be decried by the MSM?
[00:37:22.188 --> 00:37:23.269]  Absolutely not.
[00:37:23.269 --> 00:37:24.829]  Will it be decried by Trump supporters?
[00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:27.431]  No, because clearly it's a joke.
[00:37:27.431 --> 00:37:27.811]  Here it is.
[00:37:42.296 --> 00:37:45.518]  Oh my gosh, will it now be the end of the world?
[00:37:45.518 --> 00:38:02.486]  In fact, I'm gonna have the crew, Darren McBreen, let's pick one of Trump's four or five appearances on WWE that we all, I know, savored, then and now, and let's put it in a fight where Hillary knocks down Trump, and Trump knocks down Hillary, where both of them get knocked down.
[00:38:02.486 --> 00:38:03.867]  Will it be a call for violence?
[00:38:03.867 --> 00:38:04.588]  No!
[00:38:04.588 --> 00:38:05.808]  It's a joke!
[00:38:05.808 --> 00:38:09.910]  Politics is political fighting!
[00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:10.851]  That's what it is!
[00:38:13.376 --> 00:38:19.761]  And the question is, should we be freaked out about it?
[00:38:19.761 --> 00:38:35.934]  No, not when it's a joke, but when it's Democrats calling for him to be killed, and people getting into events he's at, grabbing cops' guns, and the media praising the person trying to kill Trump, and the media calling for violence against Trump supporters, and I've got CNN defending violence against Trump supporters.
[00:38:35.934 --> 00:38:41.739]  It's insane to have them then act like hurt babies.
[00:38:43.953 --> 00:38:48.117]  I know I always call you guys off guard for this.
[00:38:48.117 --> 00:39:01.548]  The crew does a great job, but try to cue it up later to specifically, or maybe edit it in later when we put this out as a video, the actual clip of Kathy Griffin when she's sobbing and fake crying and saying,
[00:39:03.169 --> 00:39:05.490]  He crushed me!
[00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:15.173]  All I did was put out a highly graphic deal of his bloody head severed it looked like Trump and all I did was go along with the media calling for his death and then he called it disgraceful!
[00:39:15.173 --> 00:39:20.134]  How dare him even speak back to me calling for his death!
[00:39:20.134 --> 00:39:28.137]  It's so rich but it shows the delusional world these people live in.
[00:39:28.137 --> 00:39:28.397]  Where
[00:39:29.861 --> 00:39:37.753]  They go out and do things and then don't expect you to live in a world of logic where you point out you're the ones that started this.
[00:39:37.753 --> 00:39:39.876]  You're the ones that called for the violence.
[00:39:39.876 --> 00:39:44.683]  You're the ones that are constantly
[00:39:46.616 --> 00:39:50.620]  Now, let's go ahead and get to some of the clips that have got them so upset about Trump.
[00:40:10.103 --> 00:40:15.025]  White House aide, the fake news complex is collapsing.
[00:40:15.025 --> 00:40:20.246]  Sebastian Gorka lays it all out.
[00:40:20.246 --> 00:40:26.308]  Trump tweeted, I'm extremely pleased to see that CNN has finally been exposed as fake news and garbage journalism.
[00:40:26.308 --> 00:40:28.689]  It's about time.
[00:40:28.689 --> 00:40:36.391]  Trump also tweeted that maybe fake news isn't the right term, but fraud news or criminal news.
[00:40:36.391 --> 00:40:38.392]  Trump also says, what are they trying to hide?
[00:40:40.236 --> 00:40:45.598]  Trump questioned states refusing to show voter ID information.
[00:40:45.598 --> 00:40:46.079]  You know why?
[00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:51.341]  Because Harvard, this year, has already done a study.
[00:40:51.341 --> 00:40:53.642]  We've been covering it for two weeks.
[00:40:53.642 --> 00:41:06.588]  Paul Watson wrote about it, where they sampled 10,000 people, randomly, from voter rolls, and they found a percentage that if you compared it to the general election and voting rolls,
[00:41:07.597 --> 00:41:14.810]  It would be 5.7 million illegals that voted, not to mention people voting in the names of dead people.
[00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:18.977]  It's a well-known Democratic Party operation for a hundred years or more.
[00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:26.776]  To keep the newspapers, to see who's died, to then go check the voter roll and then give those names.
[00:41:26.776 --> 00:41:35.123]  Normally about 10 people, 10 dead people, are given to each person that votes illegally and they go around the different precincts and that's what they do.
[00:41:35.123 --> 00:41:36.965]  The average is 10 times.
[00:41:36.965 --> 00:41:40.327]  We have Democrats on video in New York and D.C.
[00:41:40.327 --> 00:41:45.752]  and other areas, top-level Democrats saying, we're organizing the biggest fraud ever, F. Trump.
[00:41:47.179 --> 00:41:49.020]  And they almost stole the election.
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.442]  Five states were stolen.
[00:41:50.442 --> 00:41:52.103]  They almost stole six others.
[00:41:52.103 --> 00:41:57.607]  Homeland Security under Obama was trying to break into the computers, but the state officials stopped it.
[00:41:57.607 --> 00:42:04.072]  Obama's answer was to say, I signed an executive order federalizing the elections.
[00:42:04.072 --> 00:42:07.715]  I'm signing an executive order federalizing these elections.
[00:42:10.202 --> 00:42:22.930]  And now Trump is trying to defederalize it, but all he said was, hey states, share with me the voter ID rolls, and then we want to index this just with people that are dead, and people that aren't citizens.
[00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:26.031]  We can run it right through the computer, and they said, no way.
[00:42:26.031 --> 00:42:33.576]  20 states that are still Democrat controlled, all of them Democrat, said, no way, Jose.
[00:42:33.576 --> 00:42:37.138]  Now, I thought no illegals voted.
[00:42:37.138 --> 00:42:38.859]  I thought no dead people voted.
[00:42:42.512 --> 00:42:49.617]  And now more and more is coming out, even the Associated Press of Homeland Security trying to break into the computers on election night.
[00:42:49.617 --> 00:42:56.923]  I mean, what do you think's going on when CNN was sampling 36 points in some of their polls against Trump?
[00:42:56.923 --> 00:43:02.607]  They were adding 36 percentage points in and admitting it in their methodology.
[00:43:02.607 --> 00:43:08.292]  Of course Hillary was winning by 67% when you add 30-something percent more on top of it.
[00:43:09.278 --> 00:43:27.986]  Because the real polls, the internal polls, the scientific polls, the big Google data polls, some of which were in the news, others of which I talked to high-level executives and high-level people in Congress and high-level folks in the CIA, Trump was 20 points ahead when he came out of that Republican convention.
[00:43:27.986 --> 00:43:32.988]  On election day, in an index of internal polls, he was 14 points ahead of Hillary.
[00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:35.530]  14 points!
[00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:38.232]  Remember, I told you all this during the election!
[00:43:38.232 --> 00:43:44.377]  They have thousands of articles lying Alex Jones says Trump's really 15 points ahead, 20 points ahead.
[00:43:44.377 --> 00:43:47.639]  But what happened on election day?
[00:43:47.639 --> 00:43:57.507]  He had such a mega landslide that despite all the fraud and everything he threw, he still won by the Electoral College.
[00:43:59.451 --> 00:44:02.192]  And then Hillary won the popular vote by two and a half million.
[00:44:02.192 --> 00:44:05.294]  And then Trump came out and said, well, big study show, 3.3.
[00:44:05.294 --> 00:44:07.995]  And they went, oh, Alex Jones said that.
[00:44:07.995 --> 00:44:08.556]  He made it up.
[00:44:08.556 --> 00:44:15.019]  No, I was going off Pew Research, Harvard, George Washington Mason.
[00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:15.760]  They know that.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.902]  They just say I make this stuff up.
[00:44:19.902 --> 00:44:22.123]  So now Trump says, what are they trying to hide?
[00:44:24.451 --> 00:44:26.355]  Yes, the fake news complex.
[00:44:26.355 --> 00:44:26.896]  That's what it is.
[00:44:26.896 --> 00:44:32.007]  It is the fake news complex of the special entrance is imploding.
[00:44:32.007 --> 00:44:33.911]  Does it mean we're going to have some perfect world after this?
[00:44:33.911 --> 00:44:34.031]  No.
[00:44:37.472 --> 00:44:39.253]  Remember Trump didn't believe the polls?
[00:44:39.253 --> 00:44:43.054]  Because Trump had internal scientific polls.
[00:44:43.054 --> 00:44:45.655]  Trump had access to the Bloomberg database.
[00:44:45.655 --> 00:44:47.595]  Trump had access to the Google database.
[00:44:47.595 --> 00:44:49.356]  You can buy access to that.
[00:44:49.356 --> 00:44:52.197]  They tried to deny it, but let me give everybody a newsflash.
[00:44:52.197 --> 00:45:00.760]  Trump got around it with his corporate contacts that already have access to those databases that can predict the future with almost complete certainty.
[00:45:01.809 --> 00:45:09.073]  You don't just think Amazon for three years can predict with 99% certainty what you're going to order before you even order it?
[00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:13.535]  And then have it already packaged, waiting to be shipped by their robots?
[00:45:13.535 --> 00:45:15.136]  Oh yeah.
[00:45:15.136 --> 00:45:17.717]  They can predict it all.
[00:45:17.717 --> 00:45:24.500]  But up to the day of the election, they said she was going to win by 10 points in a landslide.
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.121]  Didn't happen.
[00:45:26.277 --> 00:45:31.382]  Trump was 14 to 16 points, depending on the internal data poll.
[00:45:31.382 --> 00:45:38.610]  And folks, these are polls off of people click, their cookies, where they go, and what they're texting, and indexes of what's in your email.
[00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:40.492]  Humans aren't looking at this.
[00:45:40.492 --> 00:45:42.834]  AI supercomputers are.
[00:45:42.834 --> 00:45:44.396]  Your Google email, all of it.
[00:45:45.765 --> 00:45:53.007]  Why do you think Google and Facebook were all panicking and doubling and tripling their money and going into complete hysteria mode saying she was invincible?
[00:45:53.007 --> 00:46:02.109]  There was no way she could be stopped because they knew Trump had a massive lead and they couldn't take it away from him.
[00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:07.530]  We told you the NSA was watching you and listening to you through your smartphones a decade before smartphones were even out.
[00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:11.591]  We described the devices, your TVs, all of it because of whistleblowers and data.
[00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:19.011]  I told you 20 years ago about the asexual nature of fish and amphibians caused by estrogen mimicking runoff.
[00:46:19.011 --> 00:46:23.072]  I told you about global government and the OECD and the TPP.
[00:46:23.072 --> 00:46:28.973]  I told you about TPP 11 years ago when they first had the secret meetings.
[00:46:28.973 --> 00:46:40.376]  And that's why they hate us and they look for any excuse of anything a guest says or anything somebody else says to then misrepresent what I say and what I stand for.
[00:46:40.376 --> 00:46:40.696]  Because
[00:46:42.737 --> 00:46:58.465]  They are afraid of you realizing what the real ball game is and getting involved in your life and actually changing the future destiny of the world for a future destiny for humanity, not for these globalists that have already decided the future doesn't need us.
[00:46:58.465 --> 00:47:00.807]  Now, I'm going to get more into Trump.
[00:47:00.807 --> 00:47:05.409]  I'm going to get into all these clips where Trump comes out and says they think they're president.
[00:47:05.409 --> 00:47:06.330]  They're not president.
[00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.290]  They lost.
[00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:08.190]  We won.
[00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:09.551]  That's why they're panicking.
[00:47:09.551 --> 00:47:10.732]  We're going to go over all those clips.
[00:47:13.885 --> 00:47:21.872]  But first off, let me show you the anatomy of how they engage in all of this deception.
[00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:26.195]  Okay?
[00:47:26.195 --> 00:47:27.897]  If you're a radio listener, I'll break it down.
[00:47:27.897 --> 00:47:30.359]  If you're a TV viewer, obviously you can see this.
[00:47:30.359 --> 00:47:32.661]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:47:32.661 --> 00:47:36.864]  We've got Facebook, YouTube, Twitter feeds.
[00:47:36.864 --> 00:47:39.907]  If you're watching on one of those feeds, please share the feed.
[00:47:40.996 --> 00:47:43.378]  Every time you watch, that's an act of resistance.
[00:47:43.378 --> 00:47:45.139]  That's how we get around their computers.
[00:47:45.139 --> 00:47:48.422]  That's how we get around their systems blocking the video being shared.
[00:47:48.422 --> 00:47:49.763]  That's how we reach more people.
[00:47:49.763 --> 00:47:54.686]  Just like if you're listening on a local AM or FM station, tell folks how they can tune in, how they can hear the show.
[00:47:54.686 --> 00:47:56.127]  That's the act of resistance.
[00:47:56.127 --> 00:48:03.173]  That's the people overpowering the supercomputers, overpowering the Googles and the Facebooks that think you're a bunch of dumb effers.
[00:48:03.173 --> 00:48:05.835]  You're showing them this is
[00:48:08.223 --> 00:48:11.884]  The anatomy of how we force truth out into the mainstream.
[00:48:11.884 --> 00:48:13.565]  Here's a Mike Barrett story.
[00:48:13.565 --> 00:48:16.686]  More wildlife fish are experiencing intersex.
[00:48:16.686 --> 00:48:17.987]  What could be causing this?
[00:48:17.987 --> 00:48:22.389]  Endocrine disruptors threatening reproduction in fish and frogs.
[00:48:22.389 --> 00:48:22.529]  U.S.
[00:48:22.529 --> 00:48:29.091]  Geological Survey and the Fish and Wildlife Service cover the fact that at 19 national wildlife refuges,
[00:48:31.637 --> 00:48:36.562]  85% of smallmouth bass had signs of female reproductive parts.
[00:48:36.562 --> 00:48:39.685]  Of the largemouth bass, 27% were intersex.
[00:48:39.685 --> 00:48:41.587]  What could be causing this?
[00:48:41.587 --> 00:48:44.289]  This is the USGS research biologist.
[00:48:44.289 --> 00:48:55.400]  Now, what happens is, in the past, private and governmental scientists would release the truth about fluoride, about bisphenol A, about all these other chemicals, and the media would just ignore it.
[00:48:56.863 --> 00:49:01.905]  My listeners, my writers, our researchers, would point this out.
[00:49:01.905 --> 00:49:04.266]  I would then mention it on air.
[00:49:04.266 --> 00:49:14.130]  They would edit it down to sound insane, hoping to inoculate you psychologically, so that when all of this
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:16.220]  We're good to go.
[00:49:39.258 --> 00:49:41.239]  But the good news is they're losing.
[00:49:41.239 --> 00:49:49.665]  People are learning about the estrogen mimickers in printer ink, in plastics, in the trays that you use to heat up food in the microwave or in the oven.
[00:49:49.665 --> 00:49:50.846]  Folks are learning about it.
[00:49:50.846 --> 00:49:56.190]  It's now in thousands of publications a month, and there's a huge awakening to it.
[00:49:56.190 --> 00:50:00.013]  But what does Stephen Colbert do?
[00:50:00.013 --> 00:50:01.714]  What does Stephen Colbert do?
[00:50:01.714 --> 00:50:03.696]  He simply makes jokes about it.
[00:50:03.696 --> 00:50:04.556]  You know, this is so important.
[00:50:04.556 --> 00:50:05.417]  Let's skip this one break.
[00:50:07.375 --> 00:50:12.197]  So, more wildlife fish are experiencing intersex.
[00:50:12.197 --> 00:50:13.738]  What could be causing this?
[00:50:13.738 --> 00:50:20.982]  So, here's our article from 14 days ago, June 19th.
[00:50:20.982 --> 00:50:23.303]  You can go read the links to the U.S.
[00:50:23.303 --> 00:50:28.285]  Geological Survey and to the Fish and Wildlife Services.
[00:50:28.285 --> 00:50:29.606]  Okay?
[00:50:29.606 --> 00:50:31.987]  Now, here's another one.
[00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:33.448]  Here it is on the London Telegraph.
[00:50:34.653 --> 00:50:36.534]  This is July 2nd.
[00:50:36.534 --> 00:50:38.295]  This is yesterday, on Sunday.
[00:50:38.295 --> 00:50:39.296]  The London Telegraph.
[00:50:39.296 --> 00:50:41.057]  Now, they said it, so it's okay.
[00:50:41.057 --> 00:50:45.500]  The person that told you about it 22 years ago, he's bad, he's evil, he's fake.
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:46.661]  Don't listen to him.
[00:50:46.661 --> 00:50:48.662]  He's racist.
[00:50:48.662 --> 00:50:56.167]  Listen to the London Telegraph now, because whoever tells you 22 years later the exact same info, that's who gets the awards.
[00:50:56.167 --> 00:50:56.347]  Okay?
[00:50:58.012 --> 00:51:00.653]  You know, I was watching a Joe Rogan clip while I was on the elliptical yesterday.
[00:51:00.653 --> 00:51:01.754]  I love Joe.
[00:51:01.754 --> 00:51:06.256]  And he had that sarcod of a cod guy on, who's very entertaining and funny.
[00:51:06.256 --> 00:51:13.000]  But they were sitting up there looking at each topic I cover, and then misrepresenting it.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.762]  I mean, and I don't say that meanly, it's just that's what was happening.
[00:51:16.762 --> 00:51:21.364]  And then, I mean, mainly the sarcod guy was.
[00:51:21.364 --> 00:51:21.985]  Joe's a good friend.
[00:51:23.919 --> 00:51:26.401]  And you're like, well, Alex is actually right.
[00:51:26.401 --> 00:51:34.828]  There's one species of frog that has been turned trans and gay, and most of them are infertile, by one chemical.
[00:51:34.828 --> 00:51:38.011]  Yeah, it's benzonine.
[00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:42.415]  But, you know, then he projects it onto everything, and everything, you know, this is happening.
[00:51:42.415 --> 00:51:47.079]  Uh, no sir, there's more than a thousand known chemicals that are estrogen mimickers alone in one class.
[00:51:48.092 --> 00:52:09.882]  And it's every major mammal species, every major fish species, every major amphibian species, everywhere in the world, even the most remote areas, is becoming trans, or is asexual, or is totally confused, or sterile, or literally have sexual organs growing on the wrong parts of their body, and are mutated and deformed.
[00:52:09.882 --> 00:52:10.542]  Okay?
[00:52:10.542 --> 00:52:15.064]  Now, I've literally read white paper documents
[00:52:16.508 --> 00:52:16.788]  I'm an expert.
[00:52:34.486 --> 00:52:40.752]  I'm going to go through clips where he says stuff and then I'm going to sit here and go, okay, I'm going to come in here with 500 science reports.
[00:52:40.752 --> 00:52:41.172]  I'm not kidding.
[00:52:41.172 --> 00:52:43.695]  I'm going to print 500 just to be aggressive.
[00:52:43.695 --> 00:52:49.500]  And I'm going to sit here and I'm going to read him 500 going back 20 years.
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:57.888]  In fact, I just told them from memory one, I said, I thought was about a decade ago about shrimp becoming suicidal and psychotic.
[00:52:59.707 --> 00:53:09.809]  When Prozac runoff just out of the Mississippi River and it's causing most of the shrimp to basically swim to the top of the birds and get eaten and die.
[00:53:09.809 --> 00:53:13.650]  They're also attacking each other.
[00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:16.310]  Now, this is an article from 2010.
[00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:19.091]  This is an older one.
[00:53:19.091 --> 00:53:23.652]  But there's even older ones that go back to about 2001 when Fox News reported on it.
[00:53:23.652 --> 00:53:26.093]  See, I mean, most of this is just mainline news.
[00:53:26.093 --> 00:53:28.073]  Shrimp on Prozac are killing themselves.
[00:53:32.856 --> 00:53:36.678]  It's every species.
[00:53:36.678 --> 00:53:47.025]  Fish on Prozac prove anxious, scientific American, antisocial and aggressive.
[00:53:47.025 --> 00:53:52.968]  And then that leads us to this next little tidbit.
[00:53:52.968 --> 00:53:56.510]  This is how, this is the anatomy of disinformation.
[00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:00.333]  This is the anatomy of media control.
[00:54:01.824 --> 00:54:04.206]  I have Robert David Steele on.
[00:54:04.206 --> 00:54:05.767]  I've had him on for about 12 years.
[00:54:05.767 --> 00:54:09.329]  He was a case officer in anti-terrorism in the CIA.
[00:54:09.329 --> 00:54:13.732]  That's undisputed.
[00:54:13.732 --> 00:54:17.815]  He has written a lot of publications, reviewed hundreds of books.
[00:54:17.815 --> 00:54:19.416]  He was a well-known lecturer.
[00:54:19.416 --> 00:54:20.136]  He comes on.
[00:54:20.136 --> 00:54:25.820]  I'm talking about the Deputy Pope indicted for raping dozens and dozens of young children.
[00:54:26.727 --> 00:54:28.147]  Okay, that's a fact.
[00:54:28.147 --> 00:54:30.488]  Now, what does the media do when something like that's out?
[00:54:30.488 --> 00:54:31.649]  I'm covering it with a guest.
[00:54:31.649 --> 00:54:32.649]  I've had him for 12 years.
[00:54:32.649 --> 00:54:36.930]  You can say anything you want about this show.
[00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:44.152]  I don't get into UFOs, aliens, and stuff like that because it's a distraction from things I can prove.
[00:54:44.152 --> 00:54:47.033]  He says, yes, not only, you know, have they been kidnapping kids.
[00:54:47.033 --> 00:54:52.115]  I was talking about Dr. Ewan Cameron, who admittedly kidnapped over 10,000 children from the CIA.
[00:54:52.115 --> 00:54:53.875]  This is on History Channel.
[00:54:53.875 --> 00:54:55.956]  In the 50s, 60s, and 70s, took them to Canada.
[00:54:56.687 --> 00:55:02.573]  Where they had them in brainwashing facilities to literally create Manchurian candidates.
[00:55:02.573 --> 00:55:08.159]  You can search engine, Dr. Ewing Cameron, Jolly and West, you'll get mainstream news about this.
[00:55:08.159 --> 00:55:11.483]  But because I'm informed, see, it's weird, it's bizarre, it's bad.
[00:55:14.042 --> 00:55:19.583]  He goes, yes, well, my info is they have taken children for the space program and sent them to Mars.
[00:55:19.583 --> 00:55:26.884]  Yeah, I know there's a bunch of people, like the granddaughter of President Eisenhower says that, a lot of people, just because folks say it doesn't mean it's real.
[00:55:26.884 --> 00:55:31.525]  But I wanted him back on today, but he canceled to challenge him on this.
[00:55:31.525 --> 00:55:33.565]  Because I said on air, I said, I don't know about that.
[00:55:33.565 --> 00:55:34.565]  I don't believe that.
[00:55:34.565 --> 00:55:40.246]  But I said, Buzz Aldrin told me some similar stuff about secret stuff on Mars and on the moon.
[00:55:40.246 --> 00:55:42.967]  And I said, I don't know if he was messing with me or not.
[00:55:43.951 --> 00:55:48.675]  But that got picked up by the press.
[00:55:48.675 --> 00:55:57.702]  So, we have this huge government history of secret experimentation, everything else going on, lying to us about babies and incubators to get us into the Iraq War, all the rest of it.
[00:55:57.702 --> 00:56:00.144]  You should question anything they say or do.
[00:56:00.144 --> 00:56:04.988]  But I've never said secret moon bases or secret Mars bases.
[00:56:04.988 --> 00:56:07.751]  But what does the media do?
[00:56:07.751 --> 00:56:11.594]  They ran hundreds of articles over the weekend saying I specifically
[00:56:13.643 --> 00:56:20.167]  That Trump's ally, Alex Jones, says this.
[00:56:20.167 --> 00:56:21.628]  Now here's how the deception works.
[00:56:21.628 --> 00:56:27.332]  Media Matters comes out, funded by the Democratic Party and George Soros, on record.
[00:56:27.332 --> 00:56:32.996]  Alex Jones guests, children have been kidnapped and sent to slave colony on Mars.
[00:56:32.996 --> 00:56:35.737]  They at least have me saying I don't believe it and I disagree with the guests.
[00:56:35.737 --> 00:56:39.100]  They actually got it right, because they know what happens next to the media.
[00:56:40.267 --> 00:56:47.472]  Trump-endorsed media outlet accuses NASA of operating child slave colony on Mars.
[00:56:47.472 --> 00:56:50.594]  So, no, it's not a Trump-endorsed media outlet.
[00:56:50.594 --> 00:56:52.856]  I didn't endorse it.
[00:56:52.856 --> 00:56:54.437]  So you've got this story from Slate.
[00:56:54.437 --> 00:56:55.798]  It's a total lie.
[00:56:55.798 --> 00:56:57.579]  That's how it works.
[00:56:57.579 --> 00:56:58.639]  New conspiracy theory.
[00:56:58.639 --> 00:57:00.701]  Children kidnapped from Mars slave colony.
[00:57:01.932 --> 00:57:03.032]  Space.com.
[00:57:03.032 --> 00:57:09.155]  They got the NASA to have a press conference and say, I'm insane, this isn't true, when I didn't say it.
[00:57:09.155 --> 00:57:11.076]  Why are they psyoping against me?
[00:57:11.076 --> 00:57:17.398]  Why did a CIA guy say something he knew was going to then be blown up and would be hung around my neck?
[00:57:17.398 --> 00:57:18.299]  There you go.
[00:57:18.299 --> 00:57:23.941]  When all I was trying to do was cover the Vatican and giant child kidnapping operations that are confirmed.
[00:57:23.941 --> 00:57:24.821]  Washington Post.
[00:57:24.821 --> 00:57:27.862]  No, NASA is not hiding kidnapped children on Mars.
[00:57:27.862 --> 00:57:28.983]  Goes on to say, I'm saying that.
[00:57:30.011 --> 00:57:35.843]  NASA clarifies, we don't have child sex slaves on Mars.
[00:57:35.843 --> 00:57:36.965]  That's how they do this.
[00:57:36.965 --> 00:57:38.529]  That's the anatomy, folks, of it.
[00:57:39.542 --> 00:57:52.074]  So, we're forcing a discussion about all these chemical runoffs and stuff being added to your water that makes you asexual or confuses areas of your brain to basically manipulate your sexual preference.
[00:57:52.074 --> 00:57:52.955]  That's a fact.
[00:57:52.955 --> 00:57:57.919]  They don't want to debate about this, so they attack the organization that's been day one exposing it.
[00:57:57.919 --> 00:57:58.500]  But guess what?
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.541]  They lost.
[00:57:59.541 --> 00:58:01.342]  You may make fun of me all day.
[00:58:01.342 --> 00:58:02.363]  I may get ridiculed.
[00:58:03.164 --> 00:58:06.285]  I may have libtards point at me in the street and laugh.
[00:58:06.285 --> 00:58:06.786]  I don't care.
[00:58:06.786 --> 00:58:07.606]  They're victims.
[00:58:07.606 --> 00:58:08.546]  I'm the adult.
[00:58:08.546 --> 00:58:12.228]  I'm here trying to help them and everybody else because we're in this together.
[00:58:12.228 --> 00:58:15.229]  The good news is I'm forcing human-animal chimeras out.
[00:58:15.229 --> 00:58:16.210]  Oh, that's the other thing the media did.
[00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:18.210]  They mixed in.
[00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:22.712]  Jones also says that they've brought the aliens back to Earth, and there's thousands of them here.
[00:58:22.712 --> 00:58:30.974]  No, I said, I don't believe we have a colony on Mars, but we've already, with chimeras, human-animal hybrids, created stuff that's alien here on Earth.
[00:58:30.974 --> 00:58:32.515]  Then I showed the Smithsonian.
[00:58:32.515 --> 00:58:33.735]  Then I showed science.
[00:58:33.735 --> 00:58:34.635]  They didn't care.
[00:58:34.635 --> 00:58:38.356]  They twisted it all together, because they're fake, lying news.
[00:58:38.356 --> 00:58:39.997]  Hour number two coming up.
[00:58:39.997 --> 00:58:41.357]  We need your prayers.
[00:58:41.357 --> 00:58:43.538]  Spread the link, InfoWars.com.

[00:58:52.056 --> 00:58:53.457]  Let's go to Devin in Florida.
[00:58:53.457 --> 00:58:55.699]  Devin in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:58:55.699 --> 00:58:56.160]  Great!
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.281]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:58:57.281 --> 00:59:01.805]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:59:01.805 --> 00:59:03.507]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:59:03.507 --> 00:59:11.093]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:59:11.093 --> 00:59:11.794]  Wow, thank you.
[00:59:11.794 --> 00:59:14.236]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[00:59:14.236 --> 00:59:15.878]  Which Nutraceuticals do you like best?
[00:59:16.118 --> 00:59:19.562]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:59:19.562 --> 00:59:20.863]  That's really incredible.
[00:59:20.863 --> 00:59:24.266]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:59:24.266 --> 00:59:25.287]  I haven't felt asleep.
[00:59:25.287 --> 00:59:26.949]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:59:26.949 --> 00:59:28.090]  And I love you guys.
[00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:30.352]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[00:59:30.352 --> 00:59:37.219]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:59:37.219 --> 00:59:38.260]  You will love it.
[00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:38.740]  I'm telling you.
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:40.082]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:59:40.362 --> 00:59:44.788]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:44.788 --> 00:59:45.669]  It's a win-win.
[00:59:45.669 --> 00:59:51.116]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:51.116 --> 00:59:53.699]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:14.463]  Big Brother.
[01:00:14.463 --> 01:00:16.284]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:16.284 --> 01:00:18.205]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:18.205 --> 01:00:19.866]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:21.526]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:21.526 --> 01:00:27.388]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.388 --> 01:00:33.811]  I wanted to get Robert David Steele back on the broadcast today, but he had to cancel.
[01:00:35.583 --> 01:00:49.911]  And I wanted to ask him, you know, out of the blue, after knowing you 12 years, and you've said nothing but credible stuff, and you were on the ground, case manager, anti-terrorism operations, in the Middle East.
[01:00:49.911 --> 01:00:56.835]  Why would you then, just on my show, inject that there's a Mars slave colony of children that were kidnapped?
[01:00:56.835 --> 01:01:01.278]  And then I said, I don't believe that, I don't buy that, but the media didn't care.
[01:01:01.278 --> 01:01:03.239]  And Steele's not stupid.
[01:01:04.687 --> 01:01:09.248]  He knows that they would then come out and say that I said that.
[01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:11.308]  Was it a publicity stunt?
[01:01:11.308 --> 01:01:12.469]  Does he really believe it?
[01:01:12.469 --> 01:01:15.609]  He'll come back on, I guess, sometime in the future.
[01:01:15.609 --> 01:01:19.470]  Couldn't come on today.
[01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:28.072]  But it doesn't hurt me that the media edited that and had a NASA press conference and said that I'm insane.
[01:01:28.072 --> 01:01:31.833]  See, because I'm public enemy number one from the globalists, and I know why.
[01:01:33.171 --> 01:01:35.974]  Because we do our research and we force stories out.
[01:01:35.974 --> 01:01:39.618]  You think they want a discussion about animal-human chimeras?
[01:01:39.618 --> 01:01:46.445]  That deserve rights and it shouldn't be going on, it should be banned?
[01:01:46.445 --> 01:01:56.515]  You think they want a discussion about every major industrialized country having 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 percentage increases in breast cancers, depending on the type?
[01:01:58.643 --> 01:02:01.925]  You think they want a discussion and a debate about all this?
[01:02:01.925 --> 01:02:05.608]  I'm forcing a debate with my audience who is awesome.
[01:02:05.608 --> 01:02:06.648]  I'm pro-human.
[01:02:06.648 --> 01:02:11.612]  I'm totally anti-racist because I'm pro-human race.
[01:02:11.612 --> 01:02:15.854]  I don't say that because I'm on some guilt trip and, you know, they've called me all these names.
[01:02:15.854 --> 01:02:18.196]  I say that because I'm proud of what I stand for.
[01:02:20.936 --> 01:02:39.403]  You don't think that contraceptive pills just massively increase breast cancer risk when it's running off into the water supply and you're downstream in say somewhere like Louisiana, New Orleans and the big ole Mississippi comes down and the big ole Mississippi comes down and hits that delta.
[01:02:40.433 --> 01:02:44.495]  Comes down to Baton Rouge and comes down to New Orleans and all those other big cities.
[01:02:44.495 --> 01:02:47.496]  And that it's causing almost all the fish to be deformed.
[01:02:47.496 --> 01:02:50.277]  It's causing almost all the frogs to be deformed.
[01:02:50.277 --> 01:02:54.779]  And to be, when I call them gay, I did that on purpose to get the media to pick up on it.
[01:02:54.779 --> 01:02:58.540]  We're talking about sexual organs growing out of their mouths, growing out of their backs.
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:04.242]  We're talking about almost all of them being males acting like females, females acting like males.
[01:03:04.242 --> 01:03:05.143]  They're fried!
[01:03:06.806 --> 01:03:08.428]  And I'm trying to have a big debate about this.
[01:03:08.428 --> 01:03:14.353]  This is a biological, chemical holocaust going on.
[01:03:14.353 --> 01:03:17.817]  And it's not lazy companies that just don't care and are dumping it in the water.
[01:03:17.817 --> 01:03:21.240]  That's part of it.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:31.290]  It's the globalists absolutely engineering the confusion of the sexes and admitting in the 60s, in major university papers I cover in Game 2.0 that's free online,
[01:03:32.588 --> 01:03:38.589]  Where they said we're going to confuse people with chemicals and the food and water.
[01:03:38.589 --> 01:03:48.751]  In 1974, the outgoing White House science czar John P. Holdren wrote Ecoscience, where he said the same thing!
[01:03:48.751 --> 01:03:49.572]  Do you understand?
[01:03:49.572 --> 01:03:52.612]  Now let's show them gerbils with testicles growing on top of their heads.
[01:03:52.612 --> 01:03:53.352]  Go ahead and show them.
[01:03:53.352 --> 01:03:55.933]  Stopping gerbils to form that ate GMO corn.
[01:03:57.056 --> 01:04:00.520]  Third generation, hair growing out of their mouths, testicles on top of their heads.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:05.947]  And again, everybody plays the clips and makes jokes, and Stephen Colbert plays it, and he giggles and laughs.
[01:04:05.947 --> 01:04:10.392]  They know it's not funny.
[01:04:10.392 --> 01:04:12.214]  So, I'm not even mad at Steele.
[01:04:12.214 --> 01:04:16.239]  The point is, is that it was clearly just inserted into there for whatever reason.
[01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:21.692]  And now it's Alex Jones that said that, even though I never said that.
[01:04:21.692 --> 01:04:34.022]  I told you the Fish and Wildlife Service exponentially is worried about there not even being any viable fish in most ponds and most rivers because they're so genetically whacked out.
[01:04:34.022 --> 01:04:41.349]  And then once the genetics starts getting whacked out, it accelerates until you have a literal mutant population like out of some sci-fi movie.
[01:04:42.196 --> 01:04:43.416]  Yeah, there's some of the photos.
[01:04:43.416 --> 01:04:43.977]  It gets worse.
[01:04:43.977 --> 01:04:45.517]  That's second gen.
[01:04:45.517 --> 01:04:50.319]  That's second gen rats that have been fed GMO corn.
[01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:52.500]  You want to show third generation, you can show the guinea pigs too.
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.580]  The testicles on top of the head.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:55.481]  I know it's funny.
[01:04:55.481 --> 01:04:56.461]  Wait till you're dying of it.
[01:04:59.659 --> 01:05:03.104]  President Trump's tweets have sent the Democrats into a tizzy again.
[01:05:03.104 --> 01:05:13.881]  After President Trump ripped Psycho Joe and No IQ Mika last week, Trump got back on Twitter yesterday and posted a short video of himself beating up another man depicted as a CNN logo.
[01:05:13.881 --> 01:05:14.763]  A total classic.
[01:05:14.983 --> 01:05:25.835]  But the Democrats didn't appreciate Trump's animosity towards the fake news network CNN, and are now drumming up the bill for impeachment based on the 25th Amendment, citing grounds that the President is mentally unfit to serve.
[01:05:25.835 --> 01:05:31.441]  Now, this would require a medical examination, which may come back to bite the Democrats that are calling for it.
[01:05:31.441 --> 01:05:31.722]  You see,
[01:05:32.162 --> 01:05:36.526]  Given a fair examination of the President's health, Trump will pass with flying colors.
[01:05:36.526 --> 01:05:47.316]  But imagine if the tables were turned and Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders were asked to pass the same test, given the importance of their jobs.
[01:05:47.316 --> 01:05:49.818]  I wonder if they would still be pushing this bill.
[01:05:49.818 --> 01:05:51.559]  Something tells me they wouldn't be.
[01:05:51.559 --> 01:05:54.302]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:06:00.194 --> 01:06:04.019]  MycoZX is back in after five plus months sold out.
[01:06:04.019 --> 01:06:05.521]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[01:06:05.521 --> 01:06:07.223]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[01:06:07.223 --> 01:06:09.666]  Latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:10.848]  It's been sold out for months.
[01:06:10.848 --> 01:06:11.749]  Big waiting list.
[01:06:11.749 --> 01:06:15.473]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[01:06:15.473 --> 01:06:16.655]  Nobody's got something this good.
[01:06:16.755 --> 01:06:23.798]  Save 30% off of MycoZx and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 billion lives in each pill.
[01:06:23.798 --> 01:06:31.662]  Probiotic MycoZx contains seven of the world's most powerful organic and wild-crafted ingredients designed to attack and melt away the membrane of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:06:31.662 --> 01:06:37.485]  Start fighting back against hidden yeast and fungus with MycoZx and ForageLife.com before it sells out again.
[01:06:37.945 --> 01:06:40.027]  10% off when you choose auto-ship.
[01:06:40.027 --> 01:06:46.492]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's type stuff that didn't exist years ago now it's epidemic.
[01:06:46.492 --> 01:06:51.857]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them because regardless you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[01:06:51.857 --> 01:06:54.859]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:07.675]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:07.675 --> 01:07:15.759]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:16.059 --> 01:07:20.942]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:20.942 --> 01:07:27.725]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:27.725 --> 01:07:34.909]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:34.909 --> 01:07:41.772]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[01:08:10.467 --> 01:08:13.128]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:13.128 --> 01:08:14.848]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:14.848 --> 01:08:23.850]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:28.331]  The fake media is trying to silence us.
[01:08:28.331 --> 01:08:32.012]  But we will not let them.
[01:08:32.012 --> 01:08:34.993]  Because the people know the truth.
[01:08:37.245 --> 01:08:44.621]  The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I'm president and they're not.
[01:09:12.094 --> 01:09:12.895]  We're live, folks.
[01:09:12.895 --> 01:09:13.875]  We're now into the second hour.
[01:09:13.875 --> 01:09:14.956]  Leo Zegami's coming up.
[01:09:14.956 --> 01:09:20.260]  I wanted to hear a little bit of what Trump had to say at a veterans rally.
[01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:24.823]  We won, and they lost.
[01:09:24.823 --> 01:09:33.330]  The fact is, the press has destroyed themselves because they went too far.
[01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:34.671]  That's right.
[01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:39.254]  Instead of being subtle and smart, they used a hatchet.
[01:09:40.325 --> 01:09:46.650]  And the people saw it right from the beginning.
[01:09:46.650 --> 01:09:58.219]  The dishonest media will never keep us from accomplishing our objections on behalf of our great American people.
[01:09:58.219 --> 01:09:59.800]  Will never happen.
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:03.803]  Even if they can bring down Trump, which is getting harder and harder, unless they kill him, they're done.
[01:10:05.985 --> 01:10:08.666]  Is not your agenda, you've been saying it.
[01:10:08.666 --> 01:10:11.227]  I will never stop fighting for you.
[01:10:11.227 --> 01:10:29.273]  I am delivering on trade, on the economy, on the Supreme Court, on the Second Amendment, on our military, for our veterans, and on our borders, where we are doing record, record stoppage.
[01:10:30.942 --> 01:10:32.423]  Amazing.
[01:10:32.423 --> 01:10:35.005]  I'm the president, I got elected, you didn't.
[01:10:35.005 --> 01:10:37.067]  These special interests are becoming more and more shrill.
[01:10:37.067 --> 01:10:39.549]  We've got for the next 40 minutes or so, then I've got a bunch of clips.
[01:10:39.549 --> 01:10:42.812]  I'm going to open the phones up and take your calls for the rest of the transmission.
[01:10:42.812 --> 01:10:43.792]  Leo Zegami.
[01:10:43.792 --> 01:10:54.361]  I remember Leo Zegami 10 years ago saying that Pope Francis, head of the Jesuits, would end up being the Pope.
[01:10:54.361 --> 01:10:59.966]  And they never had a Jesuit, much less a head of the Jesuits, as the Pope.
[01:11:01.004 --> 01:11:06.626]  I'm not a Catholic, but I knew that that was, you know, basically against the rules.
[01:11:06.626 --> 01:11:18.929]  And then, I've read some of his books and writings, long before it came out in the news, that they were using sex operatives to basically compromise the Catholic Church and cause a takeover.
[01:11:18.929 --> 01:11:26.352]  And then, sure enough, a few years ago, when Ratzinger had to step down and was sent to Gandalf Castle... I'm not kidding, folks, that's the name of the castle he was sent to.
[01:11:26.352 --> 01:11:27.152]  That's not from Lord of the Rings.
[01:11:29.278 --> 01:11:35.641]  There it was in Leningrad that they'd use blackmail to get Francis in.
[01:11:35.641 --> 01:11:45.425]  But then when I traveled to Rome about a year and a half ago and met with Zagami, there outside the Vatican, we also went inside, he said, listen, we're going to bring down this Pope.
[01:11:45.425 --> 01:11:49.067]  It's all coming out very, very soon.
[01:11:49.067 --> 01:11:51.868]  And just so much of what he said has turned out to be accurate.
[01:11:51.868 --> 01:11:56.290]  Again, when I first read his stuff ten years ago, I thought this is just preposterous.
[01:11:56.290 --> 01:11:57.371]  And now, last week,
[01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:03.974]  Cardinal sex abuse charges raise questions about Pope's record.
[01:12:03.974 --> 01:12:14.943]  Reportedly, dozens and dozens of young boys raped and groomed over 40 years by his right-hand man, his confidant.
[01:12:14.943 --> 01:12:18.285]  So this is amazing.
[01:12:18.285 --> 01:12:20.888]  So I want to bring Leo Zagami up.
[01:12:21.823 --> 01:12:33.022]  To talk about this and internally, because he lives right there in Rome, his family's been in government, he's been involved, there's a lot of amazing contacts, living right there in Rome, talking to the Vatican police and more.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:35.541]  Predicting this would happen.
[01:12:35.541 --> 01:12:36.642]  What does this signify?
[01:12:36.642 --> 01:12:39.243]  What internal war does this show?
[01:12:39.243 --> 01:12:40.504]  Is this part of the larger movement?
[01:12:40.504 --> 01:12:49.331]  I know intelligence agencies, the good factions in Europe here, you name it, have been saying they're going after the pedo rings that Trump has signified and signaled this.
[01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:51.052]  Now we see bust in the UK.
[01:12:51.052 --> 01:12:52.533]  We see record bust here.
[01:12:52.533 --> 01:12:53.493]  We're seeing it in Italy.
[01:12:53.493 --> 01:12:55.095]  We're seeing it all over.
[01:12:55.095 --> 01:12:56.616]  Leo, you talked about this.
[01:12:57.116 --> 01:13:09.028]  When I was in Rome, I guess it was about two years ago now, time flies, you said, get ready, this is going to start happening, the good guys are going to strike back, and now it's happening, or is this part of something else?
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:11.701]  No, it's happening, Alex.
[01:13:11.701 --> 01:13:15.283]  Hello, first of all, to you and your listeners and your viewers.
[01:13:15.283 --> 01:13:22.949]  Well, it's happening, and it's happening clearly in front of the whole world with George Pell, but it's also an internal conflict.
[01:13:22.949 --> 01:13:34.717]  A few days before George Pell got booted out of the Vatican, we had basically the police breaking inside the palace of the Holy Office, the ex-Inquisition, now known
[01:13:35.718 --> 01:13:35.958]  I think?
[01:13:53.132 --> 01:13:57.314]  Who himself was waging war against Cardinal Pell.
[01:13:57.314 --> 01:13:59.315]  So there is also an internal war here.
[01:13:59.315 --> 01:14:09.359]  And of course, nobody wanted to show the face of this priest, but I wanted to show it to your viewers.
[01:14:09.359 --> 01:14:11.420]  He's called Monsignor Luigi Capozzi.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:32.436]  And only very few media, I think only RT probably, just mentioned the name of Capozzi's boss, this Cardinal Coco Palmieri, who started this internal conflict because Coco Palmieri and his secretary, who was found in this gay orgy, they are strong supporters of Pope Francis.
[01:14:33.056 --> 01:15:01.822]  So this is really becoming an incredible scandal and once Cardinal Pell goes back in Australia, he's now I think already back in Australia, the actual scandal starts to unfold for the Anglo-Saxon media because Cardinal Pell is responsible for many decades of secret plan devised by the Vatican to give the less possible money to the victims of pedophilia
[01:15:02.342 --> 01:15:03.683]  And manipulate them.
[01:15:33.443 --> 01:15:47.432]  Well, Cardinal Pell was called in the Vatican at the end of 2013 to preside over a totally new office that will take care of the economy of the Vatican.
[01:15:47.432 --> 01:15:52.775]  You can understand that this must be probably the most important office in the whole of the Vatican.
[01:15:52.775 --> 01:15:54.797]  This could be one of the most important offices in the world.
[01:15:54.797 --> 01:15:58.059]  We know the Vatican wealth is just incalculable.
[01:15:59.289 --> 01:16:07.075]  And he was made a member of the C9 group, which is a group of nine cardinals.
[01:16:07.075 --> 01:16:15.582]  And three of these cardinals have been heavily criticized for having protected in the past pedophilia, including Cardinal Pell.
[01:16:15.582 --> 01:16:25.991]  So many people were actually astonished of seeing in February 2014 Cardinal Pell arriving in Rome, and he didn't really hide in front of the media
[01:16:26.531 --> 01:16:27.412]  All right.
[01:16:56.651 --> 01:17:03.255]  This is the first time in history, Alex, that such a high-ranking officer or minister of the Vatican is put in front of a trial.
[01:17:16.924 --> 01:17:26.886]  There is actually no deal between Australia and the Vatican, so Cardinal Peir could have stayed in the Vatican without being arrested.
[01:17:26.886 --> 01:17:40.869]  But in the end, I guess the situation forced him out, because there's also an internal war now within the Vatican, and this war involves both the economic side of the Vatican,
[01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:46.957]  The political side and, of course, the sexual scandals with the drugs.
[01:17:46.957 --> 01:17:57.993]  Now, we know very well about this letter that was sent by four cardinals, including a friend and supporter of Steve Bannon, who is Cardinal Burke.
[01:17:58.928 --> 01:18:18.559]  Cardinal Burke and his other four cardinals ended up more and more isolated, and as you know he was supervising the Knights of Malta as a spiritual advisor, but instead the Pope immediately sent them away in a remote island investigating some case of pedophilia.
[01:18:19.119 --> 01:18:26.102]  But just to get him out of Rome, because Cardinal Burke, for him, is like seeing Donald Trump.
[01:18:26.102 --> 01:18:28.903]  So, I mean... So let me just stop you for a moment.
[01:18:28.903 --> 01:18:30.563]  Let me just stop you for a moment.
[01:18:30.563 --> 01:18:32.244]  Clearly this is unraveling.
[01:18:32.244 --> 01:18:37.966]  And I know you have law enforcement sources, because we were there, we met with some of them with you, obviously, when I came and visited with you.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:47.717]  And you've been saying this is all coming, so explain to us, like we're four years old, because I know you live there, you're an expert, so you understand it, and you're a reporter that's been exposing this.
[01:18:47.717 --> 01:18:48.939]  Who are the players exactly?
[01:18:49.918 --> 01:18:52.942]  What does this massive fissure know?
[01:18:52.942 --> 01:18:53.742]  What does this tell us?
[01:18:53.742 --> 01:18:57.647]  Because clearly they're saying this is the highest level person ever to get indicted.
[01:18:57.647 --> 01:19:03.534]  They're saying it could be hundreds of children, grooming young boys, supplying them.
[01:19:03.534 --> 01:19:05.136]  I mean, how big is this?
[01:19:05.136 --> 01:19:07.298]  Was this an internal fight that busted him?
[01:19:07.298 --> 01:19:10.101]  Or was this the Liberty Movement worldwide going after him?
[01:19:11.022 --> 01:19:24.013]  This is a worldwide thing, Alex, and I can prove it for your viewers today because the first person Cardinal Pell brought in Rome with him was Lord Christopher Patton.
[01:19:24.013 --> 01:19:34.623]  And Lord Christopher Patton was responsible for defending the BBC pedophilia rings between 2011 and 2014 when he was in charge of the trust of the BBC.
[01:19:35.706 --> 01:19:44.053]  So, Christoph M. Patten, who defends the pedophiles in England, arrives with George Pell in Rome.
[01:19:44.053 --> 01:19:45.634]  Ah, stay there, stay there, we gotta go to break.
[01:19:45.634 --> 01:19:52.600]  Vatican expert Leo Zagami, whose books that I've read, three of them now, read like he was in a time machine of the future.
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.121]  He'll be with us on the other side.
[01:19:54.121 --> 01:19:56.383]  Again, this is incredible.
[01:19:56.383 --> 01:19:57.584]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:23:36.769 --> 01:23:37.450]  Awesome.
[01:23:37.450 --> 01:23:40.532]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[01:23:40.532 --> 01:23:42.094]  NASA PAC Technology.

[01:24:13.596 --> 01:24:18.281]  I gotta tell ya, I've been reading Leo Zagami's work for, I guess, more than a decade now.
[01:24:18.281 --> 01:24:19.642]  I've read three of his books.
[01:24:19.642 --> 01:24:22.465]  I've met him, spent days with him in Rome.
[01:24:22.465 --> 01:24:24.106]  And by then I knew he was for real, but...
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:30.624]  I gotta tell you, I mean, everything he wrote about and talked about is like coming true like magic.
[01:24:30.624 --> 01:24:33.266]  In fact, the cover of one of his books is lightning striking the Vatican.
[01:24:33.266 --> 01:24:44.153]  We go out there one night to videotape live and lightning strikes it the same way it did on the cover of his book and he goes, it's just, it's crazy.
[01:24:44.153 --> 01:24:49.757]  I mean, it's just everything about this very eerie, very magic, also very, very weird vibe.
[01:24:49.757 --> 01:24:51.858]  But now it's all coming out.
[01:24:51.858 --> 01:24:52.679]  Look at these headlines.
[01:24:53.601 --> 01:24:57.542]  The pedophile blind cardinal who could bring down Pope Francis.
[01:24:57.542 --> 01:25:00.643]  And this is out of the Daily Beast last year.
[01:25:00.643 --> 01:25:04.184]  3-3-16.
[01:25:04.184 --> 01:25:05.484]  So, more than a year ago.
[01:25:05.484 --> 01:25:14.647]  And everything he's talking about, the cover-up scandals and payoffs of Lord Patton's reign, that's the Telegraph covering up the pedophiles there.
[01:25:14.647 --> 01:25:17.388]  Mainline News in England says pedophiles run the country.
[01:25:19.201 --> 01:25:23.504]  I mean, we're talking about killing kids, you name it, it's all coming out.
[01:25:23.504 --> 01:25:24.965]  It is literally a satanic network.
[01:25:24.965 --> 01:25:27.066]  And then you know why they're so against Trump.
[01:25:27.066 --> 01:25:34.892]  Now, the New York Times, the Washington Post, they all just say, oh, sex assault, Pope's right-hand man investigation.
[01:25:34.892 --> 01:25:37.733]  No, it's kidnapping, raping, procuring children.
[01:25:37.733 --> 01:25:39.695]  They don't even put it in the headlines what it is.
[01:25:39.695 --> 01:25:42.797]  So the whole liberal globalist media is defending.
[01:25:44.025 --> 01:25:47.871]  This right-hand man of the Pope, number three in the Catholic Church.
[01:25:47.871 --> 01:25:49.153]  It is unbelievable.
[01:25:49.153 --> 01:25:51.798]  Leo Zagami, let me ask you.
[01:25:51.798 --> 01:25:53.981]  We know the forces at the Vatican, who they are.
[01:25:53.981 --> 01:25:55.323]  We'll talk about that in a moment.
[01:25:55.323 --> 01:25:56.005]  Leo Zagami.
[01:25:57.574 --> 01:25:59.814]  Leo Zegami, let me ask you this question.
[01:25:59.814 --> 01:26:08.016]  Who is behind this global, sudden wave of thousands of thousands of pedophiles per country being caught?
[01:26:08.016 --> 01:26:10.296]  10,000 plus arrests here.
[01:26:10.296 --> 01:26:13.697]  Kids being caught in cages in California.
[01:26:13.697 --> 01:26:16.637]  You'll see it in the news one time and then nothing else after it.
[01:26:16.637 --> 01:26:19.018]  I mean, this is beyond the twilight zone.
[01:26:19.018 --> 01:26:25.459]  What is causing this massive move against pedophile rings that even MSM admits may bring down the Catholic Church?
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:38.183]  A few weeks ago I received a phone call by a professor, a very respected professor in economy at one of the most prestigious Italian universities, and his name is Antonio Maria Rinaldi.
[01:26:38.183 --> 01:26:41.544]  He called me and he said, Leo, something big is about to happen.
[01:26:41.544 --> 01:26:43.545]  They're really closing in on the
[01:26:44.085 --> 01:26:44.966]  I don't know.
[01:27:06.463 --> 01:27:13.048]  So, it's very difficult to put through all these truths that are coming out, because we are censored left, right and center.
[01:27:13.048 --> 01:27:15.229]  The liberal media dominates completely.
[01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.569]  That's right.
[01:27:15.569 --> 01:27:18.171]  I should add, you've even been detained, arrested before.
[01:27:18.171 --> 01:27:19.212]  That's been in the news.
[01:27:19.212 --> 01:27:21.193]  You're a big figure in Italy and in Rome.
[01:27:21.193 --> 01:27:24.976]  For those who don't know, you don't brag about it, but you've had family that were national senators.
[01:27:24.976 --> 01:27:30.540]  Remember Trump in 2012 tweeted, got to do something about these missing children grabbed by perverts.
[01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:33.742]  Too many incidents, fast trial, death penalty.
[01:27:34.002 --> 01:27:37.225]  The word from high-level Trump supporters and his security people.
[01:27:52.339 --> 01:27:52.699]  I think?
[01:28:08.127 --> 01:28:18.453]  We'll have the next segment to give you the floor because you're the expert, but we have high-level Clinton operatives, convicted shipping and kids, kids disappearing, the UN mass raping children.
[01:28:18.453 --> 01:28:21.094]  How big is this empire of pedophiles?
[01:28:21.094 --> 01:28:24.036]  And from my research, that's just the gateway drug.
[01:28:24.036 --> 01:28:28.678]  After that, it's literal Satanism, human sacrifice, devil worship.
[01:28:28.678 --> 01:28:31.460]  Describe to us from your deep research how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[01:28:32.697 --> 01:28:43.599]  Well, first of all, we have a president of one of the most important countries in the world, France, who was himself a victim of pedophilia.
[01:28:43.599 --> 01:28:54.181]  Macron is shown in an image, which is he's 15 years old and behind him the future wife and ex-husband of the future wife.
[01:28:54.181 --> 01:28:58.762]  And this should make you think about how they're really making this a normality.
[01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:08.247]  A president of a country as powerful as France, that has nuclear weapons and so on, is in the hands of a guy who looks down on Trump.
[01:29:08.247 --> 01:29:14.232]  And, you know, he... And notice, notice, none of the EU leaders, none of the world leaders now have children.
[01:29:14.232 --> 01:29:17.134]  Only Trump has children.
[01:29:17.134 --> 01:29:20.797]  Yeah, because they destroyed the family image, the family tradition.
[01:29:20.797 --> 01:29:22.058]  That's what they're trying to do.
[01:29:22.058 --> 01:29:24.880]  I mean, they have... Look at Italy.
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:27.923]  Italy used to be totally family, has the lowest birth rate in Europe.
[01:29:29.477 --> 01:29:30.998]  Well, absolutely.
[01:29:30.998 --> 01:29:37.240]  Lowest birth rate in Europe, and the politicians say, well, we need the immigrants to fill this gap.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:39.381]  We need to let the refugees in.
[01:29:39.381 --> 01:29:41.381]  Alex, the situation is getting worse day by day.
[01:29:41.381 --> 01:29:44.763]  We're going to talk about how the Vatican is working with radical Islam as well.
[01:29:44.763 --> 01:29:48.144]  The Pope said he's disgusted by Europe's Christian roots.
[01:29:48.144 --> 01:29:49.504]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.504 --> 01:29:50.705]  More with Leo Zegami.
[01:29:50.705 --> 01:29:51.925]  Tell everybody to tune in, folks.
[01:29:51.925 --> 01:29:53.426]  This is the Inside Intel.
[01:29:53.426 --> 01:29:55.387]  This is the Inside Intel.
[01:29:55.387 --> 01:29:56.267]  LeoZegami.com.
[01:29:59.414 --> 01:30:04.918]  The New York Times ran the headline, Central Americans scared of what's happening in US, staying put.
[01:30:04.918 --> 01:30:09.962]  This has been a popular talking point of the left, aimed at demonizing President Trump's strong border policy.
[01:30:09.962 --> 01:30:19.168]  But think about the paradigm here, implying that somehow it is a bad thing that people aren't rushing to our country in droves because it's not easy to get in and reside here illegally anymore.
[01:30:19.168 --> 01:30:24.912]  The same people implying this also stress the hardship of poor people, specifically citing health care.
[01:30:24.912 --> 01:30:28.615]  Well then how is more people here that are in need going to help that problem?
[01:30:28.815 --> 01:30:35.719]  So the Democrats complain all day about how we don't have enough welfare for Americans, yet they want to take more people in here that need welfare.
[01:30:35.719 --> 01:30:39.542]  But really all President Trump is doing is enforcing border security and law.
[01:30:39.542 --> 01:30:42.123]  But since when is it just free for anyone to come here?
[01:30:42.123 --> 01:30:45.305]  Since when is America supposed to have open doors for anyone?
[01:30:45.305 --> 01:30:48.507]  I don't see anyone from North America rushing to get into Central America.
[01:30:48.507 --> 01:30:49.388]  You know why?
[01:30:49.388 --> 01:30:51.329]  Because you couldn't, and it's better here.
[01:30:51.329 --> 01:30:53.190]  This all equates to one thing.
[01:30:53.190 --> 01:30:55.931]  More Democrats losing in upcoming elections.
[01:30:55.931 --> 01:30:58.193]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:30:59.448 --> 01:31:04.691]  Protect your skin with SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion by Emrix Essentials.

[01:32:04.078 --> 01:32:06.940]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:08.922]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:32:08.922 --> 01:32:13.745]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:32:13.925 --> 01:32:16.026]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:32:16.026 --> 01:32:17.307]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:32:17.307 --> 01:32:22.431]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:32:22.431 --> 01:32:29.175]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:32:29.295 --> 01:32:32.297]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:32:32.297 --> 01:32:35.999]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:32:35.999 --> 01:32:42.903]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.

[01:33:07.679 --> 01:33:17.241]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.241 --> 01:33:29.143]  You're listening to it, the most hated transmission in the world, if you're a globalist.
[01:33:29.143 --> 01:33:33.484]  Yeah, they're not going to be able to keep us in the dark for life.
[01:33:33.484 --> 01:33:35.684]  They're not going to be able to hide us from the waiting world.
[01:33:38.635 --> 01:33:43.617]  Nico Acosta, our great producers in there, going over these articles.
[01:33:43.617 --> 01:33:46.058]  The pedophile blind cardinal who could bring down the Pope.
[01:33:46.058 --> 01:33:47.879]  This is a year ago.
[01:33:47.879 --> 01:33:52.581]  Where he's interrogated by the police for four hours and says, yeah, I knew they were raping the kids.
[01:33:52.581 --> 01:33:56.282]  Kids liked it.
[01:33:56.282 --> 01:33:59.163]  That's what Leo Zagami was just talking about a few minutes ago.
[01:33:59.163 --> 01:34:00.704]  This is so crazy.
[01:34:00.704 --> 01:34:02.685]  And he's breaking down how arrogant they are.
[01:34:02.685 --> 01:34:07.327]  And then they meet with the top pedophile cover-up artist of England.
[01:34:08.154 --> 01:34:11.315]  This is a system of political control.
[01:34:11.315 --> 01:34:13.035]  What did they do last week?
[01:34:13.035 --> 01:34:14.296]  When I'm covering this?
[01:34:14.296 --> 01:34:19.197]  They make up a lie that I say there's a Martian slave colony of children.
[01:34:19.197 --> 01:34:20.358]  I didn't say that.
[01:34:20.358 --> 01:34:21.958]  I said I disagree with that.
[01:34:21.958 --> 01:34:22.758]  That's the headline.
[01:34:22.758 --> 01:34:26.519]  They had a NASA press conference to say I'm crazy.
[01:34:26.519 --> 01:34:32.161]  Why don't they just say that Uranistan, that the Muslims really come from Uranistan.
[01:34:32.161 --> 01:34:33.981]  That's a joke.
[01:34:33.981 --> 01:34:35.662]  Or, Palutistan.
[01:34:39.295 --> 01:34:40.515]  I mean, it's amazing, folks.
[01:34:40.515 --> 01:34:41.996]  They are literally desperate.
[01:34:41.996 --> 01:34:58.319]  Every time I talk about what's happened to kids, and they busted the number two guy to the Pope, his right-hand man number three in the Vatican, admitting he knew kids were being raped, now it turns out they've got dozens and dozens and dozens saying he raped them, brutally.
[01:34:58.319 --> 01:35:03.240]  And you've got interviews with him saying, oh, they liked it!
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:06.321]  So arrogant, believing he'd never get busted.
[01:35:08.968 --> 01:35:10.369]  Pell responded, no I didn't.
[01:35:10.369 --> 01:35:12.231]  People had a different attitude then.
[01:35:12.231 --> 01:35:17.855]  There was no specifics about the activity, how serious it was, and the boy wasn't asking me to do anything about it.
[01:35:17.855 --> 01:35:19.437]  Just lamenting and mentioning it.
[01:35:19.437 --> 01:35:22.119]  This is what the police say.
[01:35:22.119 --> 01:35:24.181]  Lamenting the sexual abuse.
[01:35:24.181 --> 01:35:30.166]  And again, they hide it in plain view, and now because of Pizzagate that they totally diverted off and made the whole controversy.
[01:35:32.588 --> 01:35:38.132]  And they lie and say that I created it, or that I'm saying no pedophilia exists in the world.
[01:35:38.132 --> 01:35:41.895]  It's all their giant deception, and it's coming down.
[01:35:41.895 --> 01:35:46.618]  It doesn't matter what they do.
[01:35:46.618 --> 01:35:49.380]  It's all coming out, so get ready.
[01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:52.683]  And even if they kill Trump, or me, or Leo Zegami, the truth's coming out.
[01:35:52.683 --> 01:35:54.224]  You can see it, you can feel it.
[01:35:54.224 --> 01:35:56.926]  There's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[01:35:57.773 --> 01:35:59.935]  We're going back to Leo Zagami of leozagami.com.
[01:35:59.935 --> 01:36:05.299]  If you want to read the unfiltered information, we'll put his URL up on screen as well.
[01:36:05.299 --> 01:36:11.003]  Leo, like the lion, L-E-O, Zagami, Z-A-G-A-M-I dot com.
[01:36:12.446 --> 01:36:14.968]  Amazing information.
[01:36:14.968 --> 01:36:18.911]  And again, just a week ago, Pope Francis was defending this guy.
[01:36:18.911 --> 01:36:20.653]  Now he's removed him.
[01:36:20.653 --> 01:36:23.655]  So, what's going to happen next in the Vatican?
[01:36:23.655 --> 01:36:27.618]  We'll get into the Islamic alliance with the Vatican now, and so much more.

[01:37:32.355 --> 01:37:36.618]  Now, adding a point to that, and we're going back to our guest,
[01:37:42.478 --> 01:37:47.539]  Gwyneth Paltrow sells supplements.
[01:37:47.539 --> 01:37:50.560]  And here is QZ.
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:54.020]  Here's D Magazine, just to show you their deceptions.
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:54.780]  D Magazine.
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:58.201]  I used to know the editor of that, D Magazine.
[01:37:58.201 --> 01:37:59.221]  Grew up with him.
[01:37:59.221 --> 01:38:00.321]  My dad was friends with him.
[01:38:00.321 --> 01:38:01.102]  That's a side issue.
[01:38:01.102 --> 01:38:02.982]  They have a new editor now, obviously.
[01:38:02.982 --> 01:38:07.803]  Are Gwyneth Paltrow's, is Dallas Magazine, and Alex Jones on the same alt health page?
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:23.973]  Now that was a lot friendlier headline than the headline they had in the New Republic saying I'm a swindler.
[01:38:23.973 --> 01:38:25.235]  And look what they have on the page.
[01:38:25.235 --> 01:38:26.616]  Let's go back to it.
[01:38:26.616 --> 01:38:28.818]  Coffee!
[01:38:28.818 --> 01:38:29.398]  That's right.
[01:38:29.398 --> 01:38:30.740]  What next will I claim?
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:32.621]  That organic Mexican
[01:38:33.638 --> 01:38:35.501]  Volcanically grown coffee is good.
[01:38:35.501 --> 01:38:36.443]  That's right.
[01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:37.705]  Folks, I'm such a kook.
[01:38:37.705 --> 01:38:40.730]  I think coffee actually works.
[01:38:40.730 --> 01:38:42.554]  Man, what fraud will I come up with next?
[01:38:42.554 --> 01:38:43.275]  That's right.
[01:38:43.275 --> 01:38:45.519]  High quality, competitively priced coffee!
[01:38:46.533 --> 01:38:49.474]  Why, Gwyneth Paltrow, she sells coffee too!
[01:38:49.474 --> 01:38:57.075]  What'll happen to Jeff Bezos if other people start selling products that politically then fund them, then we won't be under their control.
[01:38:57.075 --> 01:39:10.318]  I love how Bezos owns Whole Foods, is the biggest supplement seller in the world, but his own publication, the Washington Post, has demonized me for selling colloidal silver that I private label that is sold in Whole Foods.
[01:39:11.326 --> 01:39:28.613]  I private label the same stuff Whole Foods sells for $5 less, but his own publication, The Washington Post, says I am a charlatan for selling colloidal silver that's so popular now they sell it at Walgreens and CVS.
[01:39:28.613 --> 01:39:29.913]  It's not as high quality.
[01:39:29.913 --> 01:39:30.934]  Obviously ours is the best.
[01:39:30.934 --> 01:39:31.974]  We've done the research.
[01:39:31.974 --> 01:39:35.796]  But everybody knows silver is a backup antiviral antifungal.
[01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:38.020]  Antibacterial?
[01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:39.641]  I mean that's incontrovertible!
[01:39:39.641 --> 01:39:41.222]  But coffee now!
[01:39:41.222 --> 01:39:44.823]  I'm a kook because I sell organic shampoo!
[01:39:44.823 --> 01:39:48.724]  I'm not allowed to sell anything!
[01:39:48.724 --> 01:39:52.946]  I'm not allowed to sell toothbrushes that have antibacterial silver impregnated into them.
[01:39:52.946 --> 01:39:56.747]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is mind control.
[01:39:56.747 --> 01:39:57.708]  This is mind control.
[01:39:58.854 --> 01:40:03.555]  Because they have got articles out every day saying I'm a total kook because I sell selenium.
[01:40:03.555 --> 01:40:06.496]  Do you have any idea how many people are selenium deficient and what it does?
[01:40:06.496 --> 01:40:09.417]  You must have it for electrochemical activity in the brain.
[01:40:09.417 --> 01:40:16.739]  Do you have any idea how many people in major studies have been linked to neurological disorders because they don't have enough selenium?
[01:40:16.739 --> 01:40:19.080]  Or what happens to cancer rates without it?
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.840]  I take selenium every day.
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:22.541]  It makes me bounce off the walls.
[01:40:24.517 --> 01:40:25.618]  And I'm gonna say it.
[01:40:25.618 --> 01:40:32.542]  You need oxygen, you need water, you need vitamin C, you need selenium, you need true iodine, or you will die.
[01:40:32.542 --> 01:40:33.002]  Coffee?
[01:40:33.002 --> 01:40:34.863]  You'll just get a headache if you don't have it.
[01:40:34.863 --> 01:40:37.025]  But yes, it says I'm a kook!
[01:40:37.025 --> 01:40:38.926]  Look, look, cover page!
[01:40:38.926 --> 01:40:40.927]  Coffee!
[01:40:40.927 --> 01:40:42.388]  Coffee!
[01:40:42.388 --> 01:40:43.309]  Everybody knows!
[01:40:43.309 --> 01:40:46.551]  See, nothing from Mother Nature's any good.
[01:40:47.725 --> 01:40:50.187]  Aspirin's from Mother Nature, it's from a plant, doesn't matter.
[01:40:50.187 --> 01:40:54.009]  They don't want us being modern, basically apothecaries.
[01:40:54.009 --> 01:40:59.833]  They don't want to say, hey, this bean does this, this bean does that, this does this, this does that.
[01:40:59.833 --> 01:41:02.835]  That's how stupid they think you are.
[01:41:02.835 --> 01:41:06.258]  That I can't even sell coffee.
[01:41:06.258 --> 01:41:10.681]  They're telling you you're a kook, you're a loser, if you buy coffee from this guy, it's a fraud!
[01:41:12.210 --> 01:41:14.792]  People come here, they drink the coffee, I drink the same coffee, it's right here.
[01:41:14.792 --> 01:41:16.394]  They're like, man, that's really good, rich, delicious coffee.
[01:41:16.394 --> 01:41:17.155]  Where's that from?
[01:41:17.155 --> 01:41:19.857]  Well, it's almost Guatemalan, but they've over-planted those fields.
[01:41:19.857 --> 01:41:22.399]  It's from the Chiapas rebels right over on the Mexican side.
[01:41:22.399 --> 01:41:25.542]  They're like, man, that's amazing.
[01:41:25.542 --> 01:41:26.723]  But again, I'm a conspiracy terrorist.
[01:41:26.723 --> 01:41:33.249]  I'm going to tell you that coffee gives you energy and has been linked to gut health and even been linked as anti-cancer.
[01:41:33.249 --> 01:41:35.752]  But again, I'm not selling it as a drug.
[01:41:35.752 --> 01:41:37.814]  I'm selling coffee as coffee.
[01:41:38.697 --> 01:41:45.699]  But in the new brainwashing system, coffee does not have any neurological effects, okay?
[01:41:45.699 --> 01:41:46.359]  Just remember that.
[01:41:46.359 --> 01:41:53.681]  Now, let me go back to Leo Zagami of the powerful website leozagami.com.
[01:41:53.681 --> 01:42:02.003]  I've been ranting here, and you tend to get into details and kind of inside baseball living there in Rome for your whole life, but just recap for folks that just joined us.
[01:42:02.663 --> 01:42:26.424]  About Cardinal Pell, about all the arrogance, about what this signifies, how the certain arms of the Jesuits took over, who Francis is and what this signifies in the bombshell from your high-level sources that indeed Trump has put the impetus and I guess the courage people need because I've got federal marshals and FBI agents, Navy SEALs who are also federal officers like
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:49.623]  The saw man coming on, Craig Sawyer, who have the contacts in all over the world in intelligence agencies and they say it's killing kids, raping kids, murdering kids, they're finding the dead kids and then it's not, they'll find the dead kids or they'll find them in cages in Florida or Texas or Louisiana or New York or California and then it's never in the news again.
[01:42:49.623 --> 01:42:50.684]  Hundreds of arrests.
[01:42:51.064 --> 01:42:57.629]  It'll be in KTLA, including kids in captivity, in cages, being raped, and then it's never in the news again.
[01:42:57.629 --> 01:43:02.912]  Just imagine the power of those stories being shut down, but Trump moving against it.
[01:43:02.912 --> 01:43:04.574]  No wonder they're so threatened by him.
[01:43:04.574 --> 01:43:09.237]  So, for the next 7, 8, 9 minutes, Mr. Zegami, you've got the floor to lay all this out.
[01:43:10.669 --> 01:43:22.137]  Well, let's say first of all that all these massive immigrants, refugees arriving into Europe are perfect for the pedophilia elite to just take all the kids.
[01:43:22.137 --> 01:43:29.663]  In the last few days, a lot of people have pointed out how these children literally disappear once they're off the coast of Libya.
[01:43:30.023 --> 01:43:35.025]  Because, as I said before, they're used for the organs, but also they're used for their blood.
[01:43:35.025 --> 01:43:45.670]  Because their blood is young blood that gets taken and gets used by the elite that wants always rejuvenating blood and wants to stay younger the longer possible.
[01:43:45.670 --> 01:43:55.835]  At the same time, we have a church, the church of today, that is possible will literally go bankrupt if they have to pay all the cases of pedophilia that are affronting them.
[01:43:56.315 --> 01:44:08.840]  I mean, once we will see Cardinal Pell in Australia under the lights of the media worldwide, we will see how this crisis is going to really touch the Vatican even more than now.
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:12.281]  And at the same time, I mean, when you have the palace of the
[01:44:12.441 --> 01:44:13.101]  We're good.
[01:44:35.015 --> 01:44:44.037]  Who tipped the police to go there while they were having this gay orgy in the building where he has his offices.
[01:44:44.037 --> 01:44:47.898]  So, I mean, Pope Francis is protecting these pedophiles.
[01:44:47.898 --> 01:44:52.498]  He's protecting these pedophiles and this is becoming more evident each day.
[01:44:52.498 --> 01:44:55.259]  And at the same time, he's teaming up with Soros.
[01:44:55.259 --> 01:45:00.180]  So, with George Soros, that of course wants to flood the whole of Europe with these immigrants.
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:04.543]  We have a situation which is completely out of control now.
[01:45:04.543 --> 01:45:24.240]  The ports of Italy, the interior minister has asked and demanded Europe, if we can close down the ports of Italy because we are flooded by these immigrants, but we can't do anything because of course, you know, this new world order wants them in and we are forced to just let them in.
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:25.561]  But once they are in,
[01:45:26.161 --> 01:45:32.388]  Especially the young children, they are the first ones to disappear, because all this is interconnected.
[01:45:32.388 --> 01:45:43.622]  And at the same time, as I said, we have this crisis, the biggest crisis to face the Vatican, an economical crisis that will bring down the Vatican, because if they really had to give the money
[01:45:44.262 --> 01:45:51.668]  And there's nothing more secretive than the Vatican, it's own state, it's own country, it's own system for over 1800-1900 years.
[01:46:12.304 --> 01:46:14.206]  Could this bring down the Vatican as we know it?
[01:46:14.206 --> 01:46:19.873]  Because we know the Vatican has already been overtaken by globalists, by luciferians, by this global cult of pedophiles.
[01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:21.956]  Could this actually bring it down and cause a reform?
[01:46:22.765 --> 01:46:43.949]  Well, two weeks ago, when Libero Milone, who is the revisor of the accounts of the Vatican, gave up his job, and he was the guy immediately under Cardinal Pell, doing all the accountings for the whole thing, well, then people started to be a little bit worried about the situation, because there is something that is completely going wrong here in Rome and in the Vatican.
[01:46:44.529 --> 01:46:52.772]  And as I said, if they really had to compensate all the victims of this church, this church will have to close for bankruptcy.
[01:46:52.772 --> 01:46:57.413]  So at one point we will have to face this situation.
[01:46:57.413 --> 01:47:12.818]  Donald J. Trump is a great president and he has had the strength to go to the Vatican and he himself, he was dignified with a family next to him, with the strength of a nation that believes in certain values.
[01:47:12.818 --> 01:47:13.978]  And look how he was treated.
[01:47:14.318 --> 01:47:23.806]  I mean, Pope Francis was obviously embarrassed by his position and his role, because he is supporting George Soros all the way.
[01:47:23.806 --> 01:47:25.908]  This is what's happening, unfortunately.
[01:47:25.908 --> 01:47:33.634]  I saw headlines everywhere that Trump's going to be humiliated when he's at the G20 this week, because he's the only one against the global carbon tax, the so-called climate deal.
[01:47:33.634 --> 01:47:36.516]  No, Putin's against it as well.
[01:47:36.516 --> 01:47:39.939]  And the whole thing's a fraud, and these other countries don't have to make the cuts.
[01:47:39.939 --> 01:47:41.961]  Only Western Europe, only the United States.
[01:47:43.042 --> 01:47:55.634]  Pope Francis intervened with a whole encyclical, a whole book on this whole thing about the environment, about the carbon taxes, about the way we should treat the planet.
[01:47:55.634 --> 01:48:02.180]  So Pope Francis is the one who is manipulating this New World Order and is dominating it.
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:03.061]  Thank you.
[01:48:23.561 --> 01:48:27.106]  I was about to say, how can they deal with the magnitude of this coming out?
[01:48:27.106 --> 01:48:28.768]  I mean, I guess just not report it.
[01:48:28.768 --> 01:48:30.791]  This has hardly gotten any coverage.
[01:48:30.791 --> 01:48:35.417]  The right-hand man of the Pope covering up decades of child rape, procuring of children.
[01:48:35.417 --> 01:48:36.919]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:48:38.362 --> 01:48:51.237]  Well, they are absolutely covering up the fact there was a raid into a gay orgy, the fact that this whole thing is linked to an internal battle within the gay lobby of the Vatican.
[01:48:51.237 --> 01:48:58.425]  And, of course, we have gay male prostitutes going in every day inside the Vatican, and
[01:48:59.606 --> 01:49:10.850]  I mean, what kind of church is this, Alex, that can look down on people and say, you are a sinner, you are not a sinner?
[01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:13.832]  I mean, this is a church which is in complete disarray.
[01:49:13.832 --> 01:49:22.815]  I have published a book recently which is called Confessions of an Illuminati, Volume 3, Espionage, Tempers, and Satanism in the Shadow of the Vatican, which
[01:49:23.015 --> 01:49:23.696]  Let's be clear.
[01:49:50.038 --> 01:50:14.597]  Leo Zegami, I mean, obviously growing up there, having family and government, you got into the Freemasons, and then of course what you call classical Illuminati, and for those that don't know, there's different branches of that, there's just different branches of more modern Masons the last 250 years or so, and then George Washington wrote about the different fights within the Illuminati, but maybe you should come back and briefly speak to that, because now you're not part, right, of any of that.
[01:50:14.597 --> 01:50:17.860]  You're not in the Masons, you're not in the Illuminati, you're not part of the Vatican, any of that.
[01:50:19.011 --> 01:50:22.952]  Well, I'm part of my own organization which is trying to fight all this.
[01:50:22.952 --> 01:50:25.852]  We are a Christian order.
[01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:29.073]  We are a Christian order that believes in Christian values.
[01:50:29.073 --> 01:50:43.936]  We operate within Freemasonry trying to promote these Christian values and criticizing all this corrupt Masonic world and this corrupt system made of secret societies that simply are sects of the New World Order that brainwash
[01:50:44.076 --> 01:50:48.760]  Well, let's explain how these things interconnect and tie together in a final segment with Leo Zegami.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:49.221]  Trade Ahead.
[01:50:49.221 --> 01:50:50.141]  Ribboning information.
[01:50:50.141 --> 01:50:54.285]  Again, I read one of his first books like 10 years ago and his writings and a lot of it made sense.
[01:50:54.285 --> 01:50:58.269]  Some of it I couldn't believe and now going to meet with him for days in Rome, it all came true.
[01:50:59.181 --> 01:51:03.646]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:51:03.646 --> 01:51:05.248]  Those times may be near.
[01:51:05.248 --> 01:51:06.149]  Think about it.
[01:51:06.149 --> 01:51:10.754]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:51:10.754 --> 01:51:15.400]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:21.546]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:51:21.546 --> 01:51:28.252]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:51:28.252 --> 01:51:30.815]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:51:31.255 --> 01:51:34.057]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[01:51:59.028 --> 01:52:00.990]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:06.295]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:52:06.295 --> 01:52:07.896]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:52:07.896 --> 01:52:16.244]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:52:26.172 --> 01:52:30.593]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:52:30.593 --> 01:52:32.774]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[01:52:59.454 --> 01:53:04.918]  If there's a toxic chemical biological gas smoke emergency while traveling at home or on your job, are you protected?
[01:53:04.918 --> 01:53:05.798]  Are you prepared?
[01:53:05.798 --> 01:53:08.600]  There are over 400,000 fires in the USA every year.
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:11.702]  Up to 85% of all deaths in a fire are due to smoke inhalation.
[01:53:11.702 --> 01:53:14.564]  Three minutes without air and we as humans will die.
[01:53:14.564 --> 01:53:17.666]  Be prepared and escape safely with our Safe Escape smoke hoods.

[01:54:13.953 --> 01:54:17.075]  It's a countdown to extinction.
[01:54:17.075 --> 01:54:19.937]  Yeah, they wanna play God.
[01:54:19.937 --> 01:54:24.619]  Everything they push is about death.
[01:54:24.619 --> 01:54:29.522]  Think about all those kids.
[01:54:29.522 --> 01:54:30.923]  Caged.
[01:54:30.923 --> 01:54:31.764]  Slaved.
[01:54:31.764 --> 01:54:33.905]  Sucked dry by the psychopaths.
[01:54:33.905 --> 01:54:36.006]  Who feed off their energy.
[01:54:36.006 --> 01:54:39.929]  They're hard.
[01:54:39.929 --> 01:54:41.830]  Hope the mainstream media feels powerful.
[01:54:43.154 --> 01:54:55.957]  When you know this is all going on and you do everything you can to lie about what this show broadcasts, what we cover, the blood of those children, all over the world held in captivity, UN caught kidnapping thousands out of Haiti alone.
[01:54:55.957 --> 01:54:57.397]  The blood is on your hands.
[01:54:57.397 --> 01:54:59.718]  Leo Zagami is with us for a little bit more in the next hour.
[01:54:59.718 --> 01:55:04.799]  Then I'm opening the phones up on any issue we've covered, a bunch of other news we haven't gotten to.
[01:55:04.799 --> 01:55:05.819]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:55:11.735 --> 01:55:17.902]  We're running 30% off on MycoZx, anti-fungal, anti-candia, anti-yeast.

[01:55:20.445 --> 01:55:22.567]  It's better than the stuff that's in top clinics.
[01:55:22.567 --> 01:55:23.288]  It's amazing.
[01:55:23.288 --> 01:55:29.555]  30% off when you get it with the biome defense that knocks out the bad bacteria and has the good bacteria.
[01:55:29.555 --> 01:55:32.118]  Again, the pesticides bioaccumulate in the food.
[01:55:33.325 --> 01:55:36.148]  They knock out the good bacteria, you've got to replace them with the good ones.
[01:55:36.148 --> 01:55:42.296]  It's known science, the elite is obsessed with it, and we have the very best probiotic out there from our research, Biome Defense.
[01:55:42.296 --> 01:55:45.920]  30% off when you get it with MycoZx that's back in stock.

[01:55:53.869 --> 01:55:56.009]  That is unprecedented.
[01:55:56.009 --> 01:56:06.714]  And regardless, you're funding the operation that is hitting on all cylinders, telling it like it is, punching through MSM, more and more, forcing real issues out there.
[01:56:06.714 --> 01:56:08.695]  We're winning thanks to your support.
[01:56:08.695 --> 01:56:12.837]  So do yourself a favor and help fund the broadcast a total 360 win.
[01:56:12.837 --> 01:56:17.339]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:23.102]  Leo, I've got to get you back on the broadcast more often here.
[01:56:23.102 --> 01:56:26.063]  There's so much to cover and go over.
[01:56:26.063 --> 01:56:30.506]  Just finishing up in this little segment, the next segment, what else should people be aware of?
[01:56:30.506 --> 01:56:32.947]  Can we drill into the Islamic connection?
[01:56:32.947 --> 01:56:38.991]  For those that don't know, the Pope has been quoted in major papers, as you know, in Italy saying, I get nauseous.
[01:56:39.931 --> 01:56:43.715]  When I hear about Europe's Christian roots, we need to bring in Islam.
[01:56:43.715 --> 01:56:46.377]  It's the future while he lives behind walls.
[01:56:46.377 --> 01:56:50.781]  He is so flagrant trying to break people's will, isn't he?
[01:56:55.848 --> 01:56:57.129]  Leo, we've lost your audio.
[01:56:57.129 --> 01:57:00.331]  We're going to get that boosted here in just a moment and find out what's happening.
[01:57:00.331 --> 01:57:01.633]  And maybe see if that comes back.
[01:57:01.633 --> 01:57:02.853]  Leo, can you hear me now?
[01:57:02.853 --> 01:57:03.794]  Go ahead.
[01:57:03.794 --> 01:57:04.455]  Yes.
[01:57:04.455 --> 01:57:10.079]  As I said, the Jesuits have been in league with Islam for a long time.
[01:57:10.079 --> 01:57:13.342]  They've been secretly collaborating even with ISIS.
[01:57:14.062 --> 01:57:24.826]  There is even a priest that is said to be kidnapped, a Jesuit priest in Syria, who is actually working and recruiting with ISIS and the Islamic State.
[01:57:24.826 --> 01:57:34.130]  So the Jesuits have also collaborated with Fethullah Gulen, who tried to activate this coup that failed in Turkey.
[01:57:34.130 --> 01:57:36.851]  And we saw also the results of all that.
[01:57:36.851 --> 01:57:42.894]  So, I mean, it's obvious that the Jesuits are actually secretly in the closet.
[01:57:43.475 --> 01:57:51.571]  Muslims and I have verified this myself personally when 10 years ago I was involved with the Muslim faith.
[01:57:52.302 --> 01:58:04.710]  And at one point, through the door came the Secretary of the Inter-Religious Affairs of the Jesuits, Thomas Michel, and he presented himself... No, no, I remember you ten years ago, and you were in the Netherlands, or whatever it was, I thought it was crazy.
[01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:08.273]  And let's just say it, Leo, you've got an intelligence agency cut out.
[01:58:08.273 --> 01:58:14.357]  I mean, you're involved in Islam, you're involved in all the P2 Lodges, you're involved with the Jesuits, I mean, who are you really working for?
[01:58:14.357 --> 01:58:16.258]  And you're telling the truth, just tell us who you work for.
[01:58:17.938 --> 01:58:20.340]  Well, this is a long tradition.
[01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:21.741]  It goes back hundreds of years.
[01:58:21.741 --> 01:58:32.748]  You just have to... Maybe one day I will show you the pedigree of my family, made of many kings, of many queens, of many aristocrats, who protected the Christianity of Europe.
[01:58:32.748 --> 01:58:34.429]  So I am actually... No, I understand.
[01:58:34.429 --> 01:58:35.009]  Stay right there.
[01:58:35.009 --> 01:58:36.671]  So you're saying you're a Rosicrucian, then?
[01:58:36.671 --> 01:58:37.751]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:37.751 --> 01:58:40.393]  Stay with us.
[01:58:40.393 --> 01:58:43.795]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:43.795 --> 01:58:45.997]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:49.493 --> 01:58:50.913]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:58:50.913 --> 01:58:52.254]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:58:52.254 --> 01:58:53.474]  Why is this so good?
[01:58:53.474 --> 01:58:58.755]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:58:58.755 --> 01:59:12.298]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:59:12.298 --> 01:59:13.658]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:59:14.418 --> 01:59:16.079]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:59:16.079 --> 01:59:18.659]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:59:18.659 --> 01:59:19.960]  These are all parasites.
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:21.080]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:22.400]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:26.902]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:59:26.902 --> 01:59:30.163]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:59:30.163 --> 01:59:33.264]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:59:33.264 --> 01:59:34.304]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:59:34.304 --> 01:59:35.124]  Living Defense.
[01:59:35.124 --> 01:59:36.225]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:36.225 --> 01:59:37.245]  And folks, you can't lose.

[01:59:39.966 --> 01:59:40.086]  And...

[01:59:41.868 --> 01:59:43.210]  Infowarslives.com.
[01:59:43.210 --> 01:59:45.453]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:59:45.453 --> 01:59:51.581]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:59:51.581 --> 01:59:54.164]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:10.003 --> 02:00:14.906]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:00:14.906 --> 02:00:16.827]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.827 --> 02:00:23.452]  So, the Pope's right-hand man admits to covering up massive pedophilia and is now indicted in Australia for it.
[02:00:23.452 --> 02:00:26.133]  Leo Zegami is who he says he is.
[02:00:26.133 --> 02:00:28.315]  He's been involved in all these high-level things.
[02:00:28.315 --> 02:00:31.517]  And the stuff he's written about for 10 years has all come true, pretty much like he said it would.
[02:00:31.517 --> 02:00:34.078]  So he has a lot of credibility.
[02:00:34.078 --> 02:00:38.141]  In my book, Proofs in the Pudding, then I was asking, in all this subterfuge,
[02:00:39.318 --> 02:00:40.879]  Who's he thinks behind Trump?
[02:00:40.879 --> 02:00:42.280]  Who's behind him?
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:46.642]  Why do we see folks moving against the pedophile networks, finally?
[02:00:46.642 --> 02:00:49.664]  And he says he represents the secret Christian order.
[02:00:49.664 --> 02:00:51.685]  So let's get into all this briefly.
[02:00:51.685 --> 02:00:54.267]  Leo Zegami, who are the players from your research?
[02:00:55.319 --> 02:01:05.186]  From my research and from my own direct experience, there is a whole part of Freemasonry which is actually Christian and is siding with Donald J. Trump.
[02:01:05.186 --> 02:01:10.409]  It's the same part also of people we find also in the Knights of Malta.
[02:01:10.409 --> 02:01:25.019]  They also sided with Donald J. Trump until the Pope got furious and in fact created an inspection, special inspection over, presided over the Knights of Malta because he saw that they were rebelling against his liberal diktat.
[02:01:25.579 --> 02:01:33.143]  One thing I wanted to say before we terminate today is that you are very kind to have me on this show, but I wanted to make clear one thing.
[02:01:33.143 --> 02:01:38.786]  A couple of years ago, I said that the Pope will resign when he will be in Argentina next.
[02:01:38.786 --> 02:01:49.912]  Now, the Pope, and you can check this for yourself, there is a list of pastoral visits that you can find on Wikipedia, changed four times this visit to Argentina.
[02:01:52.533 --> 02:02:00.118]  So, it's possible that the Pope will resign next year when he goes to Argentina, but he wants to resign only when he goes to Argentina.
[02:02:00.118 --> 02:02:09.843]  There is a link with him resigning in Argentina, because he wants to retire, like an old pensioner, and going back to his native Argentina.
[02:02:09.843 --> 02:02:10.804]  This is what he wants to do.
[02:02:11.684 --> 02:02:24.227]  In the meantime, of course, he's acting, his job as Pope, as Jesuit Pope, meaning a Pope which has taken away the legitimate Pope, which is Pope Ratzinger.
[02:02:24.227 --> 02:02:39.010]  Pope Ratzinger is to all effects still the legitimate Pope, but he's been casted out by the Jesuit system, blackmailed out by the Jesuit system, who has placed this Pope Francis, because Pope Francis is a part of this big charade
[02:02:39.130 --> 02:02:40.931]  Have you seen how praised Macron is?
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:58.702]  When he's around Trump trying to crush his hand and bugging his eyes out?
[02:02:58.702 --> 02:03:18.390]  This is a document that shows basically that Macron, when he used to be Minister of Economy in France, he was lecturing in regards to globalization, the synonym of progress, in the headquarters of the Grand Orient of France.
[02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:22.552]  The Grand Orient of France represents the atheist Freemasons.
[02:03:23.052 --> 02:03:31.447]  The ones who gave birth to communism, to promoted communism basically, because communism was created... Yeah, they launched the Jacobin movement and the French Revolution.
[02:03:33.203 --> 02:03:34.824]  Of course, after that.
[02:03:34.824 --> 02:03:43.447]  But the Grand Oratory of France, after 1877, is the only obedience that accepts people who are also atheists in their lodges.
[02:03:43.447 --> 02:03:48.648]  So you see, it's not too good to generalize all Freemasons as the same.
[02:03:48.648 --> 02:03:53.710]  Unfortunately, most Freemasons today are part of this mondialization scheme.
[02:03:53.710 --> 02:03:59.992]  George Washington wrote about the modernization, kicking Christianity out, bringing Luciferianism, the occult.
[02:03:59.992 --> 02:04:00.913]  Those are in his letters.
[02:04:00.913 --> 02:04:01.893]  Anybody can read them online.
[02:04:03.112 --> 02:04:09.397]  Well, the big problem is, of course, that there is a Christian root to Freemasonry.
[02:04:09.397 --> 02:04:12.320]  This year we celebrate 300 years.
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:21.828]  2017 celebrates the 300 years of speculative Freemasonry, the moment in which the first Grand Lodge constituted in England.
[02:04:21.828 --> 02:04:24.850]  And we can say that actually the roots of Freemasonry were Christian.
[02:04:24.850 --> 02:04:31.196]  But after 1813, at that point, they decided to let the Muslims in.
[02:04:32.092 --> 02:04:35.295]  And gradually, of course, they let also everybody else in.
[02:04:35.295 --> 02:04:41.160]  But the Muslims took over Freemasonry, and that is one of the subjects that's actually in my latest book.
[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:41.660]  Well, I know.
[02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:43.782]  You used to talk about how powerful the Muslims were, and I didn't believe it.
[02:04:43.782 --> 02:04:46.184]  But behind the scenes, they run the Federal Reserve.
[02:04:46.184 --> 02:04:47.465]  You name it, they're really coming after us.
[02:04:47.465 --> 02:04:49.887]  Leo Zegami, always intriguing.
[02:04:49.887 --> 02:04:52.009]  People can find your books on your website.
[02:04:52.009 --> 02:04:54.131]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:04:54.131 --> 02:04:57.134]  Thank you for having me on, and God bless America on the Fourth of July.
[02:04:57.134 --> 02:04:57.414]  Thank you.
[02:04:59.639 --> 02:05:03.081]  President Trump's tweets have sent the Democrats into a tizzy again.
[02:05:03.081 --> 02:05:13.848]  After President Trump ripped Psycho Joe and No IQ Mika last week, Trump got back on Twitter yesterday and posted a short video of himself beating up another man depicted as a CNN logo.
[02:05:13.848 --> 02:05:14.749]  A total classic.
[02:05:14.969 --> 02:05:25.811]  But the Democrats didn't appreciate Trump's animosity towards the fake news network CNN, and are now drumming up the bill for impeachment based on the 25th Amendment, citing grounds that the President is mentally unfit to serve.
[02:05:25.811 --> 02:05:31.412]  Now, this would require a medical examination, which may come back to bite the Democrats that are calling for it.
[02:05:31.412 --> 02:05:36.513]  You see, given a fair examination of the President's health, Trump will pass with flying colors.
[02:05:36.513 --> 02:05:39.374]  But imagine if the tables were turned, and Nancy Pelosi,
[02:05:39.594 --> 02:05:47.303]  Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders were asked to pass the same test, given the importance of their jobs.
[02:05:47.303 --> 02:05:49.806]  I wonder if they would still be pushing this bill.
[02:05:49.806 --> 02:05:51.548]  Something tells me they wouldn't be.
[02:05:51.548 --> 02:05:54.291]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:06:00.174 --> 02:06:03.976]  MycoZx is back in after five plus months sold out.
[02:06:03.976 --> 02:06:05.477]  Talk about next level probiotic.
[02:06:05.477 --> 02:06:07.178]  It's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[02:06:07.178 --> 02:06:09.619]  Latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[02:06:09.619 --> 02:06:10.820]  It's been sold out for months.
[02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:11.700]  Big waiting list.
[02:06:11.700 --> 02:06:15.542]  Limited amount because it's so hard to get the compounds and to have it be California standards.
[02:06:15.542 --> 02:06:17.003]  Nobody's got something this good.
[02:06:17.003 --> 02:06:23.767]  Save 30% off of MycoZx and get the gut health support back when you get it with the Biome Defense 50 billion live in each pill.

[02:06:37.491 --> 02:06:39.992]  10% off when you choose auto-ship.
[02:06:39.992 --> 02:06:45.853]  It's kind of embarrassing to get family and crew members on that, you know, have irritable bowel and Crohn's-type stuff that didn't exist years ago.
[02:06:45.853 --> 02:06:46.453]  Now it's epidemic.
[02:06:46.453 --> 02:06:49.393]  But I'm getting ready to have a bunch of folks go ahead and come on here and tell you what it did for them.
[02:06:49.393 --> 02:06:51.814]  Because regardless, you can't lose your fun in the operation.
[02:06:51.814 --> 02:06:54.835]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or AAA2533139.
[02:06:58.681 --> 02:07:02.683]  A new shipment of Bio-True Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:02.683 --> 02:07:04.143]  We've been sold out for months.
[02:07:04.143 --> 02:07:09.205]  Our one-of-a-kind Infowarslife Bio-True Selenium formula is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:09.205 --> 02:07:13.366]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[02:07:13.366 --> 02:07:17.888]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[02:07:17.888 --> 02:07:21.109]  But Bio-True Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[02:07:23.010 --> 02:07:26.492]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[02:07:26.492 --> 02:07:30.655]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system, to DNA production and eyesight.
[02:07:30.655 --> 02:07:38.740]  BioTrue Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield X2 Basin Iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:43.643]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to order your bottle of BioTrue Selenium before we sell it again.

[02:07:52.688 --> 02:07:54.769]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[02:07:54.769 --> 02:07:56.250]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[02:07:56.250 --> 02:08:03.693]  That's InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:08:03.693 --> 02:08:07.014]  Day after day.
[02:08:07.014 --> 02:08:10.456]  Alone on a hill.
[02:08:10.456 --> 02:08:16.558]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[02:08:16.558 --> 02:08:20.140]  But nobody wants to know him.
[02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:22.361]  They can see that he's just a fool.
[02:08:23.905 --> 02:08:27.787]  From the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:46.049 --> 02:08:50.130]  Alright, we're going to be going to your phone calls on any issue, any news article you wish to raise.
[02:08:50.130 --> 02:08:55.152]  And we have a lot of other news, obviously, to get to in this hour.
[02:08:55.152 --> 02:09:02.074]  But let's just sit back and realize we see the corrupt, globalist, world government pushing Vatican on its knees.
[02:09:02.074 --> 02:09:06.476]  The leftist, Jesuit takeover of the Catholic Church on its knees.
[02:09:06.476 --> 02:09:08.257]  I'm not bashing Catholics here.
[02:09:08.257 --> 02:09:14.639]  Most Catholics around the world are absolutely in horror of this so-called Pope, Pope Francis,
[02:09:15.399 --> 02:09:20.363]  Pushing Islam, pushing open borders while he lives behind 100 and 200 foot walls.
[02:09:20.363 --> 02:09:29.570]  But we should all be thanking God that light is being shown on this incredibly corrupt, globalist, captured organization.
[02:09:29.570 --> 02:09:32.112]  That is so amazing.
[02:09:32.112 --> 02:09:43.641]  Before I go to your calls, I want to play a clip here of Huckabee making the point that the media basically hate Donald Trump more than they love America.
[02:09:43.641 --> 02:09:44.302]  That's wrong!
[02:09:45.595 --> 02:09:47.235]  The left are globalist.
[02:09:47.235 --> 02:09:50.276]  The left hate anything that's truly progressive.
[02:09:50.276 --> 02:09:52.076]  The left want to control language.
[02:09:52.076 --> 02:09:53.216]  They are tyrannical.
[02:09:53.216 --> 02:09:56.857]  Going back to the Jacobins and the false French Revolution.
[02:09:56.857 --> 02:09:58.657]  They are the founders of communism.
[02:09:58.657 --> 02:09:59.598]  They are tyrants.
[02:09:59.598 --> 02:10:04.219]  They create places like Cuba and North Korea and the Soviet Union.
[02:10:04.219 --> 02:10:05.399]  They're the left.
[02:10:05.399 --> 02:10:11.580]  Before they called it the left, it was the left-hand path meant luciferianism, devil worship, satanism.
[02:10:13.246 --> 02:10:18.029]  Left and right wasn't even used politically in the last hundred so years.
[02:10:18.029 --> 02:10:23.573]  They have totally confused everyone, but here's Huckabee getting it partially right.
[02:10:23.573 --> 02:10:28.216]  The media basically hates Donald Trump more than they love America.
[02:10:28.216 --> 02:10:40.545]  And so they're going to ignore the pro-America comments that he makes, and they're going to just camp out and never leave the campsite if he says something that offends them, which in many cases, they deserve it.
[02:10:42.216 --> 02:10:46.357]  And again, I like Huckabee, I'm not bashing him, I'm just saying, we need to go further.
[02:10:46.357 --> 02:10:47.237]  They hate us.
[02:10:47.237 --> 02:10:50.058]  They hate America.
[02:10:50.058 --> 02:11:02.362]  Coming up, by the way, at the bottom of the hour, Obama blasts aggressive nationalism, complains about Paris pullout in Indonesia, and says, don't be too nationalistic on the 4th of July.
[02:11:02.362 --> 02:11:06.823]  The arrogance of this globalist.
[02:11:06.823 --> 02:11:10.204]  Now here's Trump giving a powerful close to the rally this weekend.
[02:11:12.563 --> 02:11:22.252]  And though we have many stories, we all share one home and one glorious destiny.
[02:11:22.252 --> 02:11:33.803]  A destiny that's getting better and better every single day.
[02:11:33.803 --> 02:11:36.045]  And whether we are black or brown or white,
[02:11:37.096 --> 02:11:50.242]  And you've heard me say this before, we all bleed the same red blood.
[02:11:50.242 --> 02:12:00.107]  We all salute the same great American flag.
[02:12:00.107 --> 02:12:04.789]  And we are all made by the same almighty God.
[02:12:26.363 --> 02:12:28.785]  We face many challenges.
[02:12:28.785 --> 02:12:32.627]  There are many hills and mountains to climb.
[02:12:32.627 --> 02:12:47.897]  But with the strength and courage of the patriots assembled in this room tonight, we will scare, I mean, and you see it, and you see it all the time, and we're doing it all the time, because we're scaling those summits.
[02:12:47.897 --> 02:12:52.060]  And we will get the job done.
[02:12:57.466 --> 02:13:04.587]  We will all prove worthy of this very important moment in history.
[02:13:04.587 --> 02:13:12.029]  And we will prove worthy of the sacrifice that our brave veterans have made.
[02:13:12.029 --> 02:13:21.011]  As long as we have pride in our beliefs, courage in our convictions, and faith in our God, we will not fail.
[02:13:33.209 --> 02:13:47.457]  As long as our country remains true to its values, loyal to its heroes, and devoted to its creator, then our best days are yet to come.
[02:13:47.457 --> 02:13:55.261]  Because we will make America great again.
[02:13:55.261 --> 02:13:57.883]  This is the pendulum swinging back the other way.
[02:13:57.883 --> 02:14:01.725]  The globalists want us demoralized, they want us controlled, they want us poor.
[02:14:03.683 --> 02:14:09.024]  It isn't that Trump's perfect or I'm perfect or you're perfect, it's that we're not out to get people.
[02:14:09.024 --> 02:14:15.226]  We're not communists, we're not devil worshippers, we're not child molesters, we're not control freaks that want to run other people's lives.
[02:14:15.226 --> 02:14:21.208]  So the control freaks, as happens in history, have gotten control and have pushed so far.
[02:14:21.208 --> 02:14:26.409]  It's taken social engineers decades after decades after decades to turn us into what we are now.
[02:14:28.817 --> 02:14:34.762]  You go look at photos of people 50 years ago, 100 years ago, they have electricity in their eyes.
[02:14:34.762 --> 02:14:39.086]  You go to Target, you go to Walmart, you walk down the street, most people look like they're dying.
[02:14:39.086 --> 02:14:42.609]  They look like they are in a total mind-numbed coma.
[02:14:42.609 --> 02:14:51.596]  This has been done by the media, by the chemicals, by the biologicals, by the social engineering, but they can be brought out of the sleep trance.
[02:14:51.596 --> 02:14:52.457]  And it's happening.
[02:14:55.009 --> 02:15:03.993]  Just like the trance of a woman who thinks she's ugly, but she isn't ugly, and as soon as she thinks somebody thinks she's beautiful, she looks even more beautiful.
[02:15:03.993 --> 02:15:05.033]  It's attitude.
[02:15:05.033 --> 02:15:10.896]  And Trump is fundamentally changing that, and that's why the globalists are panicking.
[02:15:10.896 --> 02:15:11.976]  That's why they're so upset.
[02:15:11.976 --> 02:15:13.097]  I mean, here's Trump.
[02:15:13.097 --> 02:15:19.239]  Fake media is trying to silence us, but we will not let them.
[02:15:19.239 --> 02:15:22.661]  They think that they are the presidents.
[02:15:24.687 --> 02:15:27.729]  They think that they got elected, but they didn't.
[02:15:27.729 --> 02:15:45.364]  Now let me give you right now, then I'm going to your calls, the big secret on how Trump is destroying the fake news complex and why it is collapsing.
[02:15:45.364 --> 02:15:53.310]  Here's what Trump's doing.
[02:15:53.310 --> 02:15:54.251]  What Trump is doing
[02:15:57.085 --> 02:16:00.047]  It's very, very simple.
[02:16:00.047 --> 02:16:07.932]  And I'm gonna give the MSM a big secret here, but they're so arrogant, they're so narcissistic, they're so delusional, they're not going to be able to act on this.
[02:16:07.932 --> 02:16:11.774]  Because they believe they're in charge.
[02:16:11.774 --> 02:16:24.082]  They have the megalomania that any thief, any pirate, any criminal that has stolen what someone else has, they have that same twisted attitude we see throughout our lives.
[02:16:24.082 --> 02:16:26.103]  So here's the big secret for MSM.
[02:16:29.122 --> 02:16:34.065]  MSM doesn't know how to control the news cycle anymore.
[02:16:34.065 --> 02:16:46.333]  And Donald Trump is controlling the news cycle by going after Morning Joe, but not letting them get too much attention out of it, just discrediting them, exposing them.
[02:16:46.333 --> 02:16:58.261]  He lets them try to build their counteroffensive and then automatically tweets out to control the next few days cycle, the Photoshop video of him smacking down the CNN logo.
[02:16:59.724 --> 02:17:06.951]  And then by the time they try to organize their response to that, he'll move on to the next issue, and the next issue, and the next issue.
[02:17:06.951 --> 02:17:13.837]  Now, sounds simple, but you've got to have one big key ingredient.
[02:17:13.837 --> 02:17:15.339]  And that key ingredient is this.
[02:17:15.339 --> 02:17:17.921]  You have to be the President of the United States.
[02:17:17.921 --> 02:17:20.804]  You can't just be some puppet like Obama or George W.
[02:17:22.110 --> 02:17:38.236]  You have to actually know how things work, come up from the grassroots, been in the media, been in industry, been in life, seen every angle, to then know how to use that massive political bully pulpit and firepower.
[02:17:39.949 --> 02:17:45.733]  And so they can't see how they call for violence, they call for death, they call for murder.
[02:17:45.733 --> 02:17:55.059]  He comes out and just puts out a few jokes that are one-tenth of what they're saying, lets them act like a bunch of hypocrites and idiots, and then moves on to the next attack.
[02:17:55.059 --> 02:17:58.802]  And by the time they're trying to figure out what hit him, he's two or three attacks down the road.
[02:18:01.772 --> 02:18:05.653]  And they think because they're attacking him, they're in charge.
[02:18:05.653 --> 02:18:06.633]  No.
[02:18:06.633 --> 02:18:09.494]  They're attacking because they're having to follow the leader.
[02:18:09.494 --> 02:18:12.135]  They've lost control of the narrative.
[02:18:12.135 --> 02:18:16.756]  And they can't ignore the President of the United States when a real President's sitting in there.
[02:18:16.756 --> 02:18:18.956]  It's the same thing here.
[02:18:18.956 --> 02:18:21.377]  They think they're winning, writing lies about me?
[02:18:21.377 --> 02:18:24.458]  The thinking public says we better listen to Alex Jones.
[02:18:24.458 --> 02:18:25.738]  Our audience has only gone up.
[02:18:27.506 --> 02:18:36.489]  Trump went in there to be a disruptive force against globalism because globalism is a disruptive force against the people of America and the world.
[02:18:36.489 --> 02:18:47.553]  Trump went in there to give all the degenerate inbred pedophiles and scumbags a run for their money because he is so hyper-aggressive, because he is so hyper-male.
[02:18:47.553 --> 02:18:50.274]  He isn't threatened by you having a nice house or swimming pool.
[02:18:50.274 --> 02:18:53.875]  He isn't threatened by your kids getting a good college degree or having a future.
[02:18:53.875 --> 02:18:56.996]  He isn't threatened by new technologies coming out and being deployed.
[02:19:02.924 --> 02:19:08.326]  Some of the media have halfway figured it out that, oh, he's distracting from other things.
[02:19:08.326 --> 02:19:26.895]  Yes, he's giving you a media circus, media, so that he can move forward, turning the power back on, cutting the taxes, trying to reform Obamacare, securing the borders, getting us out of the TPP, reining in the WTO, the World Bank, the IMF, pulling us out of the carbon deal.
[02:19:27.935 --> 02:19:38.958]  And he's got you so focused on tweets and Mika Brzezinski's plastic surgery that he's able to move forward the agenda of returning the Republic.
[02:19:38.958 --> 02:19:47.481]  And you're not even able to put out your lies about climate change and all of it because he's got you hogtied like a lobotomized billy goat.
[02:19:47.481 --> 02:19:51.902]  There's a lot of other things Trump's doing to you that I can see, but you're too arrogant to see it.
[02:19:51.902 --> 02:19:54.583]  You're too arrogant to believe he's smarter than you.
[02:19:59.045 --> 02:20:01.606]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[02:20:01.606 --> 02:20:03.747]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[02:20:03.747 --> 02:20:05.728]  Are you happy paying high prices?

[02:21:02.825 --> 02:21:03.906]  One third.
[02:21:03.906 --> 02:21:05.927]  There's already been riots across Europe.
[02:21:05.927 --> 02:21:07.148]  Is America next?
[02:21:07.148 --> 02:21:09.429]  Hi, I'm the owner of Infidel Body Armor.

[02:21:58.208 --> 02:22:02.670]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[02:22:02.670 --> 02:22:10.634]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[02:22:10.634 --> 02:22:13.655]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[02:22:13.655 --> 02:22:17.657]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[02:22:17.657 --> 02:22:20.318]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[02:22:20.318 --> 02:22:24.000]  It's by using the amazing Home Freeze Dryer from Harvest Right.
[02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:28.665]  I have a Harvest Rite freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.

[02:22:39.737 --> 02:22:42.561]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[02:22:43.061 --> 02:22:44.783]  We love our freeze dryer.

[02:23:04.096 --> 02:23:06.937]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[02:23:06.937 --> 02:23:07.598]  Awesome.

[02:23:10.679 --> 02:23:12.260]  NASA PAC Technology.

[02:23:17.023 --> 02:23:18.463]  Or warm and served.

[02:23:30.489 --> 02:23:38.533]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[02:23:38.533 --> 02:23:40.454]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[02:23:53.179 --> 02:23:53.820]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[02:24:14.599 --> 02:24:17.041]  All right, I just got this breaking news.
[02:24:17.041 --> 02:24:20.243]  It's just broke the last 60 seconds.
[02:24:20.243 --> 02:24:24.607]  No one knows the details, but a bus reportedly ran into some people in Boston.
[02:24:24.607 --> 02:24:29.491]  Maybe an accident, maybe a terrorist attack, maybe a religion of peace event.
[02:24:29.491 --> 02:24:33.934]  We're not sure, but we will watch that as that unfolds.
[02:24:33.934 --> 02:24:35.676]  I'm going to your phone calls right now.
[02:24:35.676 --> 02:24:43.742]  If you just joined us earlier, I was breaking down the secret to how Trump is able to control the enemy media.
[02:24:47.642 --> 02:25:16.116]  And that is, he's able to do that via controlling the narrative and using his bully pulpit when they're trying to hammer on some piece of disinfo to create some new distraction and diversion that helps expose the media as liars, helps bring down the establishment media combine that discredits them, shows their frauds, empowers the American people, gives us our identity back of nationalism,
[02:25:18.619 --> 02:25:23.403]  And they're so tied up in knots, they have trouble then blocking his real agenda.
[02:25:23.403 --> 02:25:30.688]  It's beautiful, and it's quite a sight to see, and it's good to have a president in charge that's smart like that.
[02:25:30.688 --> 02:25:42.217]  His biggest problem is the Republican leadership, the fact that they're trying to block a good bill to repeal Obamacare, and the fact that they're trying to block good tax reform for the working poor, middle class, and others.
[02:25:44.184 --> 02:25:47.686]  And Trump is now coming out saying, fine, just repeal Obamacare.
[02:25:47.686 --> 02:25:49.487]  Stop creating these frauds.
[02:25:49.487 --> 02:25:52.209]  Stop telling me it does this and that, and then it doesn't.
[02:25:52.209 --> 02:25:55.511]  So now he's proving himself on target again, just saying, repeal it.
[02:25:55.511 --> 02:25:58.173]  A lot of folks say, well, that'll cut people out that don't have coverage.
[02:25:58.173 --> 02:25:59.714]  You already get charity care.
[02:25:59.714 --> 02:26:05.938]  Obamacare gets rid of that.
[02:26:05.938 --> 02:26:06.799]  Little news flash.
[02:26:06.799 --> 02:26:08.980]  Venezuela doesn't have any health care.
[02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:10.081]  They're eating each other in the streets.
[02:26:11.772 --> 02:26:13.073]  Canada has horrible health care.
[02:26:13.073 --> 02:26:14.093]  They come here.
[02:26:14.093 --> 02:26:15.133]  England has horrible health care.
[02:26:15.133 --> 02:26:16.334]  They come here.
[02:26:16.334 --> 02:26:17.014]  But doesn't matter.
[02:26:17.014 --> 02:26:19.295]  It's like seeing some trendy saying, I want to go to North Korea.
[02:26:19.295 --> 02:26:21.156]  I heard they have great health care.
[02:26:21.156 --> 02:26:25.197]  You're idiots!
[02:26:25.197 --> 02:26:29.299]  Trump really proved himself on target there saying, just repeal the whole thing if you're not going to fix it.
[02:26:31.169 --> 02:26:33.751]  We do have details of the situation in Boston.
[02:26:33.751 --> 02:26:36.773]  If they put that back on screen for me, I'll read over some of it.
[02:26:36.773 --> 02:26:38.774]  They do have injuries reported.
[02:26:38.774 --> 02:26:43.397]  Injuries reported after vehicle strikes pedestrians in Boston at the airport.
[02:26:43.397 --> 02:26:48.081]  That does not sound good.
[02:26:48.081 --> 02:26:54.245]  A vehicle struck a group of pedestrians in East Boston on Monday afternoon, Massachusetts State Police said on Twitter.
[02:26:57.193 --> 02:26:58.193]  And that's really all we know.
[02:26:58.193 --> 02:26:59.854]  Let's start going to your phone calls.
[02:26:59.854 --> 02:27:06.437]  We've got Alex in Connecticut, Steve, Sarah, O'Brien, Tim, and others.
[02:27:06.437 --> 02:27:08.318]  Alex in Connecticut, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:27:08.318 --> 02:27:11.199]  Go ahead.
[02:27:11.199 --> 02:27:11.759]  Hey, Alex.
[02:27:11.759 --> 02:27:12.400]  How are you doing?
[02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:13.920]  Good, brother.
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:14.741]  Good.
[02:27:14.741 --> 02:27:20.103]  Hey, you had mentioned, you know, we're talking about the federal file stuff and everything.
[02:27:20.103 --> 02:27:25.786]  I saw a YouTube video a few, I think last week, and I just found the video.
[02:27:25.786 --> 02:27:26.766]  I can't find exact
[02:27:27.219 --> 02:27:27.980]  We're good to go.
[02:27:43.447 --> 02:27:50.831]  Libtard shooter looked like Dennis Hastert, the Republican procurer of children.
[02:27:50.831 --> 02:27:59.735]  Doesn't necessarily, you know, mean that that was it, but it is strange that Scalise, who's been spearheading going after the pedophile rings with Trump behind the scenes, that's been confirmed.
[02:27:59.735 --> 02:28:03.497]  Scalise is spearheading with law enforcement and groups.
[02:28:03.497 --> 02:28:06.879]  It's very suspicious that he got shot by the New York Times advertised.
[02:28:06.879 --> 02:28:07.759]  Here's where they are.
[02:28:07.759 --> 02:28:08.700]  They have no security.
[02:28:09.810 --> 02:28:13.493]  A lot of this looks like he could have been a cutout and the cover for something larger.
[02:28:13.493 --> 02:28:17.896]  But thank God the police took him out within seconds.
[02:28:17.896 --> 02:28:20.058]  He only got a few shots off before the cops killed him.
[02:28:21.246 --> 02:28:22.867]  So it could have been something much larger.
[02:28:22.867 --> 02:28:29.112]  We don't know, but believe me, there are assassinations, there are black ops, there are major killings going on.
[02:28:29.112 --> 02:28:31.934]  Dealing with trying to shut down the pedophile investigation.
[02:28:31.934 --> 02:28:41.420]  I mean, I know major federal officers, TV host on Discovery Channel, who they won't even let set up a PayPal or use their current PayPal to raise money.
[02:28:42.361 --> 02:28:43.963]  To investigate pedophiles.
[02:28:43.963 --> 02:28:45.344]  They won't let them use any other platform.
[02:28:45.344 --> 02:28:47.326]  They are shutting this down so quick.
[02:28:47.326 --> 02:28:48.647]  They are scared of this.
[02:28:48.647 --> 02:28:51.730]  If you want them to come after you, start exposing the pedophile rings.
[02:28:51.730 --> 02:28:55.493]  Because, look, you see Sandusky's son getting indicted.
[02:28:55.493 --> 02:28:59.336]  You see the head of Penn State getting indicted for the cover-up.
[02:28:59.336 --> 02:29:01.098]  Those are just a few of the high-profile ones.
[02:29:01.098 --> 02:29:06.142]  There are thousands of arrests every week or two nationwide.
[02:29:06.142 --> 02:29:07.344]  Last time I checked, it was over 10,000.
[02:29:09.332 --> 02:29:11.033]  And these aren't just people with child porn.
[02:29:11.033 --> 02:29:15.317]  These are people literally with dead kids or with kids in cages.
[02:29:15.317 --> 02:29:18.940]  Now imagine, if some random guy has kids in cages, it's big news.
[02:29:18.940 --> 02:29:20.381]  Top story for weeks.
[02:29:20.381 --> 02:29:22.583]  They're busting, it'll be in the news.
[02:29:22.583 --> 02:29:28.948]  It'll say, you know, they rescued 20-something children and a bunch of other women who were in bondage, some in cages.
[02:29:28.948 --> 02:29:33.192]  Then we're like, okay, where's part two of that in KTLA, man?
[02:29:33.192 --> 02:29:35.634]  That's like Hollywood movies should be made out of that.
[02:29:35.634 --> 02:29:36.695]  It all ends there.
[02:29:37.435 --> 02:29:40.678]  Because they're only busting the procurers that are low-level.
[02:29:40.678 --> 02:29:44.160]  Great point, Alex, O'Brien, Tim, Steve, and others.
[02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:44.681]  Stay with us.
[02:29:44.681 --> 02:29:48.104]  I'm Alex Jones, Infowars.com.
[02:29:48.104 --> 02:29:49.485]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.485 --> 02:29:52.027]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.027 --> 02:29:54.709]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.414 --> 02:30:04.937]  The New York Times ran the headline, Central Americans scared of what's happening in US, staying put.
[02:30:04.937 --> 02:30:09.980]  This has been a popular talking point of the left, aimed at demonizing President Trump's strong border policy.
[02:30:09.980 --> 02:30:19.186]  But think about the paradigm here, implying that somehow it is a bad thing that people aren't rushing to our country in droves because it's not easy to get in and reside here illegally anymore.
[02:30:19.186 --> 02:30:24.930]  The same people implying this also stress the hardship of poor people, specifically citing health care.
[02:30:24.930 --> 02:30:28.632]  Well then how is more people here that are in need going to help that problem?
[02:30:28.812 --> 02:30:35.717]  So the Democrats complain all day about how we don't have enough welfare for Americans, yet they want to take more people in here that need welfare.
[02:30:35.717 --> 02:30:39.559]  But really all President Trump is doing is enforcing border security and law.
[02:30:39.559 --> 02:30:42.141]  But since when is it just free for anyone to come here?
[02:30:42.141 --> 02:30:45.303]  Since when is America supposed to have open doors for anyone?
[02:30:45.303 --> 02:30:48.525]  I don't see anyone from North America rushing to get into Central America.
[02:30:48.525 --> 02:30:49.406]  You know why?
[02:30:49.406 --> 02:30:51.347]  Because you couldn't, and it's better here.
[02:30:51.347 --> 02:30:53.208]  This all equates to one thing.
[02:30:53.208 --> 02:30:55.970]  More Democrats losing in upcoming elections.
[02:30:55.970 --> 02:30:58.212]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[02:30:58.872 --> 02:31:00.753]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:31:00.753 --> 02:31:02.793]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:31:02.793 --> 02:31:05.694]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:31:05.694 --> 02:31:11.756]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:11.756 --> 02:31:20.939]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:31:20.939 --> 02:31:25.801]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[02:31:26.021 --> 02:31:28.464]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:28.464 --> 02:31:36.513]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:36.513 --> 02:31:37.595]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:38.682 --> 02:31:42.043]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:42.043 --> 02:31:46.184]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:46.184 --> 02:31:52.906]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:52.906 --> 02:31:57.007]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[02:32:00.250 --> 02:32:05.713]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:32:05.713 --> 02:32:06.573]  I take this.
[02:32:06.573 --> 02:32:07.694]  My family takes this.
[02:32:07.694 --> 02:32:11.976]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.

[02:32:16.578 --> 02:32:21.219]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:32:21.219 --> 02:32:22.359]  I don't feel good.
[02:32:22.359 --> 02:32:26.100]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:32:26.100 --> 02:32:28.800]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:34.581]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:32:34.581 --> 02:32:37.562]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:32:37.562 --> 02:32:40.982]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[02:32:40.982 --> 02:32:43.323]  So, obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[02:32:43.323 --> 02:32:43.683]  I love it.
[02:32:43.843 --> 02:32:46.645]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:32:46.645 --> 02:32:47.666]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:32:47.666 --> 02:32:53.311]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:32:53.311 --> 02:32:55.493]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:32:55.493 --> 02:32:56.734]  It's a win-win.
[02:32:56.734 --> 02:32:57.695]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:33:13.463 --> 02:33:25.388]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.388 --> 02:33:26.969]  Alright, let's run through some of your phone calls.
[02:33:28.163 --> 02:33:32.586]  I just gotta tell you, I am so celebratory watching Trump take the gloves off.
[02:33:32.586 --> 02:33:34.988]  The first 70 days, he was hardcore.
[02:33:34.988 --> 02:33:40.031]  Then for about 30 days or so, he tried to compromise, and they came after him even more.
[02:33:40.031 --> 02:33:43.214]  And then he made a hard, libertarian right turn.
[02:33:44.494 --> 02:33:47.096]  And it has just been so good ever since.
[02:33:47.096 --> 02:33:49.678]  Their whole Russia investigation has fallen apart.
[02:33:49.678 --> 02:33:54.062]  The economy's starting to come back in many ways, but we are in a race with the devil here.
[02:33:54.062 --> 02:33:58.526]  Global numbers show that the economy is starting to stagnate.
[02:33:58.526 --> 02:34:00.387]  It's falling apart in many areas.
[02:34:00.387 --> 02:34:07.613]  Ron Paul said that he would not be surprised if we didn't see a 25% correction in global and U.S.
[02:34:07.613 --> 02:34:11.016]  markets by this winter.
[02:34:11.016 --> 02:34:11.777]  And I agree with him.
[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:17.723]  The exuberance, the confidence we've seen in Trump is great.
[02:34:17.723 --> 02:34:22.366]  I understand the stock markets have bubbled, but the globalists have set the bubble up for themselves.
[02:34:22.366 --> 02:34:28.389]  Under Trump, he's trying to engineer the Federal Reserve and stuff to give some bubble money to the people.
[02:34:28.389 --> 02:34:32.512]  And I'm not normally a guy that pushes bubbles, but we're in a cardiac arrest situation.
[02:34:32.512 --> 02:34:36.354]  And even Ron Paul says, it's going to take time to wean off this system.
[02:34:36.354 --> 02:34:38.695]  So I am all for bucking the globalists.
[02:34:38.695 --> 02:34:40.817]  I want to have an engineered slow collapse.
[02:34:40.817 --> 02:34:42.338]  I want to change that.
[02:34:43.268 --> 02:34:49.112]  Von Paul, not a total shock if stocks plummet 25% and gold soars 50% by October.
[02:34:49.112 --> 02:35:01.000]  Yes, the word is that gold should be going up as paper money becomes questionable, but the globalists and their financial manipulation tend to defy gravity.
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.542]  We will see what happens.
[02:35:03.542 --> 02:35:10.086]  Okay, we've got Russell and we've got Steve and how do you pronounce that?
[02:35:10.086 --> 02:35:10.447]  Sarah?
[02:35:11.588 --> 02:35:15.751]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:35:15.751 --> 02:35:33.463]  I just want to wish everybody a happy 4th of July, and I also want to commend Donald Trump on his excellent leadership in taking America back from the globalists.
[02:35:33.463 --> 02:35:41.208]  But my question was, do the globalists have a military on the ready in case anything was to happen to Donald Trump, if they move against Donald Trump?
[02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:46.173]  Do they have a military on the ready in DC?
[02:35:46.173 --> 02:35:48.755]  That's an excellent question.
[02:35:48.755 --> 02:35:55.179]  The globalists have any military they can get to follow them.
[02:35:55.179 --> 02:36:07.828]  So you notice you've got these little comments in the media that, oh, Trump criticizing CNN has the military leaders questioning his sanity.
[02:36:08.800 --> 02:36:17.443]  Now we told you a few months ago, first, Roger Stone here, was in a video we did on the street live, said the next shoe to drop will be that Donald Trump is mentally ill.
[02:36:17.443 --> 02:36:22.265]  He had that from his high-level sources, and that indeed is the next thing they're going with.
[02:36:22.265 --> 02:36:28.428]  Now they want to have the 25th Amendment come in, they want to have him psychologically tested, that's the new drumbeat.
[02:36:29.639 --> 02:36:31.920]  That they've got because he won't follow their orders.
[02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:33.621]  He keeps outsmarting them.
[02:36:33.621 --> 02:36:35.162]  He keeps outworking them.
[02:36:35.162 --> 02:36:51.429]  So because he's shown the fact that he is a great American president, he's got to be removed because he's not doddering, stumbling Nancy Pelosi, who said like 12 times I know of that George Herbert Walker Bush, excuse me, George W. Bush, I'm turning into Pelosi, is still president.
[02:36:52.543 --> 02:37:08.186]  So that's the move they're pushing, but they are trying to get the military to go along with the media and the Democrats and Republican leadership to have a coup against Trump if he doesn't go along with being removed from office or if he stands up and speaks out against them.
[02:37:08.186 --> 02:37:09.887]  So I think Trump is in great danger.
[02:37:09.887 --> 02:37:19.989]  Also, you have the NATO military, which is now the army of Europe, and you have the EU announcing that if any country tries to leave, they may send in NATO
[02:37:21.596 --> 02:37:23.317]  Acting as an EU army to do that.
[02:37:23.317 --> 02:37:25.239]  So the globalists have NATO.
[02:37:25.239 --> 02:37:30.162]  That's why Trump started talking about cutting NATO funding, was to bring them back to heel.
[02:37:30.162 --> 02:37:37.167]  Because we fund roughly half of NATO help found the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at the end of World War II.
[02:37:37.167 --> 02:37:39.749]  To quote, counter the Warsaw Block.
[02:37:39.749 --> 02:37:41.050]  And then of course the Soviet Union.
[02:37:44.798 --> 02:37:53.181]  If they can hoax the media and hoax the public and hoax everyone into using the military against Trump, they will.
[02:37:53.181 --> 02:37:54.761]  They've been pushing that since day one.
[02:37:54.761 --> 02:38:01.864]  Atlantic Monthly, a few months ago, called for a secession move to remove the president, have the military declare Congress defunct.
[02:38:03.004 --> 02:38:04.405]  The Democrats would be in charge.
[02:38:04.405 --> 02:38:09.529]  All Republicans elected in the last election would be removed.
[02:38:09.529 --> 02:38:20.536]  And there'd be a new special election held by Homeland Security under Obama's executive order chaired by Nancy Pelosi and of course Chuckie Schumer and run by the FBI.
[02:38:20.536 --> 02:38:23.758]  So the FBI now claiming itself co-equal to government
[02:38:24.318 --> 02:38:39.369]  Officially, would be the new Gestapo internal police with the Democratic Party controlling the elections like Venezuela here on out.
[02:38:39.369 --> 02:38:41.971]  Does that answer your question, Tim?
[02:38:41.971 --> 02:38:43.072]  Yes, it does.
[02:38:43.072 --> 02:38:43.972]  That's pretty intense.
[02:38:43.972 --> 02:38:47.175]  It seems like they've been planning this forever and ever and ever.
[02:38:47.175 --> 02:38:50.537]  I had one other question that popped in my head off the subject.
[02:38:51.446 --> 02:38:53.788]  Uh, there's something going on YouTube with Elsagate.
[02:38:53.788 --> 02:38:55.529]  Have you heard of that?
[02:38:55.529 --> 02:38:57.130]  Say that again?
[02:38:57.130 --> 02:39:08.158]  Elsagate, where they're putting, uh, where somehow YouTube has allowed, um, perverts and, uh, miscreants to dress in costumes, uh, like comic book characters and perform sex acts with children.
[02:39:08.158 --> 02:39:09.820]  And it's all over YouTube.
[02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:16.004]  Jack Pasovic and Laurel Lerner, and I believe, um, Faith Goldie from Rebel Media were talking about it.
[02:39:16.004 --> 02:39:17.005]  And I was just kind of curious.
[02:39:17.495 --> 02:39:20.357]  How does YouTube build an algorithm for that kind of stuff?
[02:39:20.357 --> 02:39:23.439]  Because they have to have an algorithm based off the views that they have.
[02:39:23.439 --> 02:39:24.080]  Well, absolutely.
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:29.083]  You know, I know they're flooding the internet with all sorts of child porn and all sorts of other weird stuff.
[02:39:29.083 --> 02:39:30.504]  I appreciate your call.
[02:39:30.504 --> 02:39:35.588]  And then, of course, the radical Islamic stuff, that always gets left on Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[02:39:35.588 --> 02:39:40.591]  And then, of course, if you're a libertarian or a patriot, you're mild criticism because it's the truth.
[02:39:40.591 --> 02:39:43.153]  And effective, it gets banned as hateful.
[02:39:43.153 --> 02:39:44.754]  But yes, they have algorithms.
[02:39:45.859 --> 02:40:00.024]  And programs for over a decade where they can ban somebody's voice, they can ban a song, they can ban something to where when you're uploading it, it already runs through a database and then isn't allowed to be uploaded.
[02:40:00.024 --> 02:40:09.188]  An example is Shazam that you can hold your phone up to, you know, eight, nine years ago at the mall, it would tell you what a song was with 10 seconds of the music.
[02:40:09.188 --> 02:40:14.270]  It's the same type of program, audio recognition, voice print recognition,
[02:40:15.543 --> 02:40:17.844]  Technology.
[02:40:17.844 --> 02:40:33.649]  And so, yes, they could be blocking all of that if they wanted to, but they want to use all that as the pretext to get us all to accept complete censorship and complete control over our lives.
[02:40:33.649 --> 02:40:41.252]  I mean, we've all experienced it on our computer or on our, quote, little smartphones that watch us and follow us around where we don't go to websites and they're just popping up.
[02:40:41.252 --> 02:40:43.573]  Usually it's mortgage ads and Viagra ads and
[02:40:44.735 --> 02:40:55.223]  I mean, those are just basic cookies, like you go to a website for men above 40 and then all of a sudden you're getting all these ads because they put cookies on there.
[02:40:55.223 --> 02:40:59.186]  That's kind of the baseline level of it, but it gets a lot more sophisticated.
[02:40:59.186 --> 02:41:01.328]  Okay, let's see who's been holding the longest here.
[02:41:01.328 --> 02:41:05.190]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Florida.
[02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:09.674]  Let's talk about the cost of freedom as we are on the eve of our nation's birth back in 1776.
[02:41:12.318 --> 02:41:13.639]  Yeah, hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:41:13.639 --> 02:41:16.800]  I want to wish you and everybody out there a very happy 4th of July.
[02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:20.703]  Yeah, I called in to talk about the cost of freedom.
[02:41:20.703 --> 02:41:29.848]  I'll guarantee, unfortunately, the way Americans are now, a lot of people don't even know what the real name of tomorrow is, which is Independence Day.
[02:41:29.848 --> 02:41:35.130]  Now, I wanted to ask you about this before I get into the few points I have about that.
[02:41:35.130 --> 02:41:37.892]  I saw on Twitter yesterday where somebody had posted,
[02:41:38.527 --> 02:41:44.629]  About Johnny Depp getting visited by the Secret Service and arrested for his threat against Trump.
[02:41:44.629 --> 02:41:46.329]  Have you heard anything about that?
[02:41:46.329 --> 02:41:48.009]  Or is that just a hoax?
[02:41:48.009 --> 02:41:50.270]  Say that again?
[02:41:50.270 --> 02:41:57.812]  Somebody posted on Twitter yesterday, they had video of this, of Johnny Depp being visited by the Secret Service and arrested.
[02:41:58.499 --> 02:42:02.000]  Because of his threat to kill Donald Trump.
[02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.161]  Is that a hoax?
[02:42:04.161 --> 02:42:14.284]  That's probably a hoax because if that was true, it'd be at the top of Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, at the top of DrudgeReport.com, it'd be at the top of Yahoo, it'd be at the top of everywhere, sir.
[02:42:14.284 --> 02:42:16.085]  So, no, that's probably a hoax.
[02:42:16.085 --> 02:42:16.865]  I appreciate your call.
[02:42:17.705 --> 02:42:27.427]  There are a lot of Johnny Depp look-alikes and there's a whole thing you see in LA and New York where there's people that look like somebody and they go out to be in public and have folks come over and sign their autographs.
[02:42:27.427 --> 02:42:29.287]  A lot of those people staged events.
[02:42:29.287 --> 02:42:35.309]  Let's go look at Twitter guys or Google video Johnny Depp arrested for for threatening Trump.
[02:42:35.309 --> 02:42:36.809]  Johnny Depp did not threaten Trump.
[02:42:36.809 --> 02:42:41.410]  Johnny Depp implied it'd be great for him to die and kind of jumped on the bandwagon
[02:42:42.330 --> 02:42:49.320]  Of anti-Trump violence that's being visited upon us by George Soros, which shows why it's all the more hypocritical.
[02:42:50.572 --> 02:42:56.416]  That we would have somebody, you know, out there like Kathy Griffin complaining that Trump just called her despicable.
[02:42:56.416 --> 02:43:07.543]  Or you'd have CNN calling for Trump to basically be removed from office because he made a joke about, you know, a smackdown at the WWE of CNN.
[02:43:07.543 --> 02:43:10.985]  Or somebody else made the joke, Trump just retweeted it.
[02:43:10.985 --> 02:43:15.247]  Speaking of that, before I go back to your calls, let's go to a few of these clips.
[02:43:15.247 --> 02:43:17.829]  Bernstein, Trump's CNN wrestling tweet.
[02:43:20.697 --> 02:43:26.682]  Causing military leaders to question his stability.
[02:43:26.682 --> 02:43:29.464]  Now, of course, they never actually tell you who the military leaders are.
[02:43:29.464 --> 02:43:33.147]  They don't tell you who the 17 intelligence agency heads are.
[02:43:33.147 --> 02:43:35.889]  Turned out that was all fake, claiming that they were unanimous.
[02:43:35.889 --> 02:43:48.119]  They always just have unnamed sources, and then some mummy, like Bernstein, who was there that brought down Nixon, is rolled out, just like Tom Brokaw is rolled out to lie about me and spew some more garbage.
[02:43:48.119 --> 02:43:48.500]  Here it is.
[02:43:50.077 --> 02:43:50.577]  I think?
[02:44:20.457 --> 02:44:21.077]  I think?
[02:44:37.922 --> 02:44:44.385]  And it's exercise under the First Amendment to the Constitution, anti-CNN.
[02:44:44.385 --> 02:44:55.009]  When they talk about incitement, these are the people saying kill Trump, CNN itself financed a play where Trump's killed, their own employee Kathy Griffin simulated chopping his head off.
[02:44:55.809 --> 02:45:02.594]  Countless other hosts have called for his death, called for his imprisonment, called for his impeachment, called for violence against his family.
[02:45:02.594 --> 02:45:10.959]  We saw them having guests on saying the guy that shot Congressman Scalise was not a evil person and was just doing what he needed to do.
[02:45:10.959 --> 02:45:18.324]  We've seen countless examples where it makes your head spin to try to even recall them all.
[02:45:18.324 --> 02:45:19.305]  Countless examples.
[02:45:21.178 --> 02:45:33.847]  And then Trump retweets somebody else's tweet with a smackdown and they act like it's the end of the world and have no context to what they've been pushing or what they have been doing.
[02:45:33.847 --> 02:45:37.109]  So CNN sponsors Trump assassination play, but that's okay.
[02:45:38.749 --> 02:45:41.070]  Here's another quote from ABC.
[02:45:41.070 --> 02:45:44.792]  Anna Navarro says, Trump tweet on CNN is an incitement to violence.
[02:45:44.792 --> 02:45:47.234]  No, you've started this war.
[02:45:47.234 --> 02:45:49.075]  He mildly tweeted back.
[02:45:49.075 --> 02:46:01.201]  You've got his head chopped off, blood everywhere, him being simulated stabbed to death every night, your host calling for his death, Democratic operatives on Fox News saying, yeah, I hashtag hunt Republicans.
[02:46:01.201 --> 02:46:02.021]  You asked for it.
[02:46:02.021 --> 02:46:03.202]  Now you're going to get it.
[02:46:03.202 --> 02:46:04.643]  You're the ones asking for it.
[02:46:06.035 --> 02:46:14.624]  But you sit up there like a bunch of cowards, nesting, like a bunch of retarded vultures, thinking because you're all together in your little nest in New York and L.A.
[02:46:14.624 --> 02:46:18.508]  that you can just sit here and piss down the back of the American people forever.
[02:46:18.508 --> 02:46:24.214]  We see through you, we know who you are, we're aware of you, and we're continuing to expose you.
[02:46:24.214 --> 02:46:26.056]  Let's go to the clip from ABC.
[02:46:26.056 --> 02:46:26.417]  Here it is.
[02:46:28.081 --> 02:46:29.642]  I'm a CNN commentator.
[02:46:29.642 --> 02:46:31.284]  I think that is unacceptable.
[02:46:31.284 --> 02:46:34.706]  I think that is the President of the United States taking things way too far.
[02:46:34.706 --> 02:46:36.448]  It is an incitement to violence.
[02:46:36.448 --> 02:46:39.170]  He is going to get somebody killed in the media.
[02:46:39.170 --> 02:46:40.811]  Maybe that will stop him.
[02:46:40.811 --> 02:46:46.596]  I am disappointed beyond belief by the answer that the Homeland Security Advisor just gave.
[02:46:46.596 --> 02:46:47.737]  What a wuss!
[02:46:47.737 --> 02:46:48.517]  What a wuss!
[02:46:48.517 --> 02:46:51.480]  You could see that he is ceding his principles.
[02:46:51.860 --> 02:46:57.183]  You are the Homeland Security Advisor and you can't stand here and say the difference between right and wrong?
[02:46:57.183 --> 02:46:58.704]  That's what's part of the problem.
[02:46:58.704 --> 02:47:05.388]  He is surrounded by enablers that do nothing but shake their heads and nod their heads in agreement with everything that he says.
[02:47:05.388 --> 02:47:06.169]  They have got to stop.
[02:47:06.169 --> 02:47:06.929]  Look at this fake moral outrage.
[02:47:06.929 --> 02:47:09.851]  They have got to stand for democracy, for freedom of the press.
[02:47:09.851 --> 02:47:12.733]  This is just going way too far.
[02:47:12.733 --> 02:47:18.296]  The President of the United States is inciting violence against the free press.
[02:47:18.296 --> 02:47:20.818]  In America, we cannot stand for it.
[02:47:22.058 --> 02:47:29.385]  America, we cannot stand for it when Obama is saying we shouldn't celebrate the 4th of July too much and that nationalism is dangerous.
[02:47:29.385 --> 02:47:30.546]  That's the headlines.
[02:47:30.546 --> 02:47:35.811]  Obama blasts aggressive nationalism, complains about Paris pullout in Indonesia.
[02:47:35.811 --> 02:47:36.652]  Here's another one.
[02:47:36.652 --> 02:47:40.956]  Obama warns Americans about too much patriotism on July 4th weekend.
[02:47:40.956 --> 02:47:43.338]  That's up on Infowars.com, his own quotes.
[02:47:43.338 --> 02:47:44.600]  You cannot make this up.
[02:47:45.779 --> 02:47:50.582]  Then you roll out somebody with all this immoral consternation and outrage.
[02:47:50.582 --> 02:47:53.304]  And she's like, how dare you do this to America?
[02:47:53.304 --> 02:47:54.365]  We have a free press.
[02:47:54.365 --> 02:47:57.047]  Yeah, you're calling for his death, CNN.
[02:47:57.047 --> 02:47:58.248]  You're pushing all this.
[02:47:58.248 --> 02:48:00.749]  So he puts out a joke tweet.
[02:48:00.749 --> 02:48:03.371]  Imagine you come at him with a knife.
[02:48:03.371 --> 02:48:06.653]  He comes at you with WWE joke.
[02:48:06.653 --> 02:48:09.155]  You come at him with real gunman.
[02:48:09.155 --> 02:48:10.676]  And CNN celebrates it.
[02:48:10.676 --> 02:48:14.279]  He comes at you with a joke just pointing out that, yes, you're the enemy.
[02:48:15.211 --> 02:48:16.312]  Yes, you hate America.
[02:48:16.312 --> 02:48:20.035]  Yes, you represent multinationals that want to end the sovereignty of this country.
[02:48:20.035 --> 02:48:24.698]  We don't want any violence against you, and President Trump has said that, and we've said that.
[02:48:24.698 --> 02:48:31.683]  And we have the WikiLeaks where you sent violent people, CNN, working with WikiLeaks, working with Hillary, all one big group.
[02:48:33.313 --> 02:48:35.475]  Not working with WikiLeaks, WikiLeaks showing that.
[02:48:35.475 --> 02:48:43.701]  Working with those Democratic Party officials that WikiLeaks shows to try to absolutely foment violence in this country that you could then blame on Trump.
[02:48:43.701 --> 02:48:45.743]  But it was you doing it.
[02:48:45.743 --> 02:48:46.803]  You got caught.
[02:48:46.803 --> 02:48:47.804]  You got caught.
[02:48:47.804 --> 02:48:48.565]  You got caught.
[02:48:48.565 --> 02:48:53.568]  We're going to come back and go to your phone calls, but I want to play a clip after we do that.
[02:48:53.568 --> 02:48:56.030]  GOP Representative Taylor to CNN.
[02:48:56.030 --> 02:48:58.112]  You guys are getting played.
[02:48:58.112 --> 02:48:58.912]  Absolutely.
[02:48:58.912 --> 02:49:00.994]  Trump is totally controlling them.
[02:49:03.109 --> 02:49:05.411]  Everybody knows it's the Democrats out there calling for violence.
[02:49:05.411 --> 02:49:06.932]  Everybody knows it's Soros.
[02:49:06.932 --> 02:49:11.896]  Everybody knows that they're the ones out there hitting people in the head with bricks and bike locks and knocking out windows.
[02:49:11.896 --> 02:49:18.582]  Everybody knows that you're the ones taking over the colleges and spewing racist garbage everywhere.
[02:49:18.582 --> 02:49:22.465]  Everybody knows this.
[02:49:22.465 --> 02:49:26.889]  So how do they hold two diametrically opposed thoughts in their heads, Democrats?
[02:49:27.793 --> 02:49:44.607]  But they're pushing for violence, they're pushing for death, they're making jokes about it, they're celebrating Scalise getting shot, they're saying cops deserve to get killed, all the news, and then, and then they turn around and say that Trump's the one inciting violence.
[02:49:44.607 --> 02:49:49.751]  I'm very excited to announce that after almost six months of it being sold out, MycoZX,
[02:49:50.959 --> 02:49:52.140]  is now back in stock.
[02:49:52.140 --> 02:50:02.966]  And when you get it with the probiotic that it goes hand-in-glove with, Biome Defense, 500 million active strains in each capsule, you get to 30% off when you combo the two.
[02:50:02.966 --> 02:50:05.768]  Ladies and gentlemen, probiotics have changed the world.
[02:50:05.768 --> 02:50:12.251]  They've helped so many people counteract what pesticides in the food does, killing your good intestinal flora.
[02:50:12.251 --> 02:50:14.152]  It's key to take a good probiotic.
[02:50:14.152 --> 02:50:15.013]  Do your own research.
[02:50:15.013 --> 02:50:16.394]  It's open and shut.
[02:50:17.336 --> 02:50:36.021]  But what's getting missed is the yeast, the candida, the fungus, and MycoZx has natural concentrated herbs and compounds, totally organic, known to knock that out and knock out the slime wall that funguses create, where they steal the nutrients before it goes through into your intestinal wall and your bloodstream.
[02:50:36.021 --> 02:50:38.122]  The research is on Infowarslife.com.
[02:50:39.722 --> 02:50:42.264]  Check it out for yourself, or call 888-253-3139.
[02:50:42.264 --> 02:50:51.049]  If you're one of the rare people that doesn't have a fungus infection or fungus, you know, overgrowth in your gut, then hey, you supported the broadcast.
[02:50:51.049 --> 02:50:57.433]  But if you're the majority of people, from my research, they admit it, they have problems, it's a game changer and you support the broadcast.
[02:50:58.615 --> 02:51:03.077]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[02:51:03.077 --> 02:51:11.040]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:14.061]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[02:51:14.061 --> 02:51:18.063]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[02:51:18.063 --> 02:51:20.744]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[02:51:20.744 --> 02:51:24.406]  It's by using the amazing Home Freeze Dryer from Harvest Right.
[02:51:25.086 --> 02:51:29.088]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[02:51:29.088 --> 02:51:34.310]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[02:51:34.310 --> 02:51:40.132]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long-lasting food on hand.
[02:51:40.132 --> 02:51:42.953]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.
[02:51:43.473 --> 02:51:45.195]  We love our freeze dryer.

[02:54:22.426 --> 02:54:24.329]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:54:24.329 --> 02:54:27.354]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:54:27.354 --> 02:54:28.816]  The news website is Infowars.com.
[02:54:30.785 --> 02:54:34.006]  The world has reached a point of massive change.
[02:54:34.006 --> 02:54:37.766]  The old media order, the old establishment orders are collapsing.
[02:54:37.766 --> 02:54:53.789]  They are filled with people like Nancy Pelosi, Michael Moore, Maxine Waters, who don't know what planet they're on, but continue to just parrot what the establishment says, believing if there's enough parrots saying the same thing, the world will go that direction.
[02:54:53.789 --> 02:54:56.750]  Trump rode in on a wave of global awakening.
[02:54:57.836 --> 02:55:03.103]  I said if he actually delivered on what he said he was going to do, he'd become George Washington 2.0.
[02:55:03.103 --> 02:55:05.806]  Ladies and gentlemen, he's done it.
[02:55:05.806 --> 02:55:09.111]  You can blame him for not getting the tax cuts in or Obamacare repealed.
[02:55:09.111 --> 02:55:10.913]  That's the Republican leadership's fault.
[02:55:10.913 --> 02:55:13.556]  And the American people in big polls know that.
[02:55:13.556 --> 02:55:14.418]  They know it's not Trump.
[02:55:16.067 --> 02:55:18.430]  But Trump isn't even the issue.
[02:55:18.430 --> 02:55:32.727]  It's what he signifies, the breaking with the establishment, and the MSM, and the foreign leaders, and the pedophile Pope, and all of them, throwing everything they've got at him, and the American people, and it's failed.
[02:55:33.663 --> 02:55:42.685]  They attack yours truly in hundreds of major publications a day, on CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, every day.
[02:55:42.685 --> 02:55:49.307]  They have NASA press conferences lying and saying that I said there's slave colonies on Mars.
[02:55:49.307 --> 02:55:51.148]  Never said it.
[02:55:51.148 --> 02:55:52.088]  They're desperate.
[02:55:52.088 --> 02:55:54.869]  They say I'm racist, but have no proof.
[02:55:54.869 --> 02:55:57.269]  They can't show you a clip of me saying Mars bases.
[02:55:57.269 --> 02:55:59.350]  They can't show me saying anything racist.
[02:56:00.387 --> 02:56:06.731]  They just say it because they're the desperate fake news hanging on by their fingernails, and they know they are.
[02:56:06.731 --> 02:56:09.373]  So I want to salute you all.
[02:56:09.373 --> 02:56:14.297]  I want to thank you for the support, but I want you to know you are the InfoWar.
[02:56:14.297 --> 02:56:15.097]  You did this.
[02:56:15.097 --> 02:56:28.747]  Whether you live in Mexico, or Brazil, or South Africa, or Nigeria, or Iraq, or Germany, or Russia, or Japan, or Australia, or Indonesia, or Easter Island,
[02:56:30.077 --> 02:56:38.061]  If you don't buy into the globalist paradigm, and you believe it's okay to question the establishment, then you're what they call a heretic, a conspiracy theorist.
[02:56:38.061 --> 02:56:43.263]  Well, welcome to the club, because we're changing the world together.
[02:56:43.263 --> 02:56:48.346]  That's why they misrepresent what we say and what we do, because we are on target.
[02:56:49.909 --> 02:56:51.030]  I want to thank our affiliates.
[02:56:51.030 --> 02:56:53.051]  I want to thank our sponsors.
[02:56:53.051 --> 02:56:54.451]  I want to thank the listeners.
[02:56:54.451 --> 02:56:55.572]  I want to thank the good Lord above.
[02:56:55.572 --> 02:56:59.134]  I want to thank my family, because they've gone through a lot so that I can sit here and tell the truth.
[02:56:59.134 --> 02:57:02.776]  But at the end of the day, folks, it's all a lie.
[02:57:02.776 --> 02:57:07.898]  I cannot walk down the street without my hand getting shook hundreds of times if I'm downtown.
[02:57:07.898 --> 02:57:09.999]  I can't hardly get my own food paid for.
[02:57:09.999 --> 02:57:14.182]  I can't pay valets to park my car.
[02:57:14.182 --> 02:57:16.523]  You'd think I'd be persecuted
[02:57:18.769 --> 02:57:23.412]  For my views and the media demonizing me, you'd think a lot of people bought into it.
[02:57:23.412 --> 02:57:33.959]  No, it's a tiny minority of educated idiots who think they're the ruling class and they are hopping mad and don't even know what to do when they get around me.
[02:57:33.959 --> 02:57:36.681]  They run, basically.
[02:57:36.681 --> 02:57:41.184]  And I feel sorry for them because they're always buying into a false paradigm
[02:57:42.665 --> 02:57:48.088]  A false strawman Alex Jones that isn't even who they say I am.
[02:57:48.088 --> 02:57:49.428]  You've seen the Owen Schroer clips.
[02:57:49.428 --> 02:57:58.012]  We're going to play some of these in the next hour with David Knight out at the anti-fob fascist rallies against America financed by Soros.
[02:57:58.012 --> 02:58:03.375]  They're outnumbered 5 to 1 here in Austin, 10 to 1 in other cities.
[02:58:03.375 --> 02:58:07.257]  And they're out there screaming and yelling and they can't even talk.
[02:58:08.735 --> 02:58:12.196]  When you look at them, whether they're black or white, they look mentally ill.
[02:58:12.196 --> 02:58:13.836]  They look lobotomized.
[02:58:13.836 --> 02:58:15.457]  They can't string sentences together.
[02:58:15.457 --> 02:58:17.718]  They look like they were just let out of mental institutions.
[02:58:17.718 --> 02:58:19.498]  I feel sorry for them.
[02:58:19.498 --> 02:58:20.898]  And they can't talk.
[02:58:20.898 --> 02:58:22.359]  They can't even defend.
[02:58:22.359 --> 02:58:25.700]  They won't even talk to you because they're brutalized people.
[02:58:26.841 --> 02:58:32.704]  Guaranteed we're abused as children or raised in, you know, daycare and never held by mommy.
[02:58:32.704 --> 02:58:40.687]  And they believe the government, the state is their mommy, and they believe we're attacking that big old mammary gland hanging down out of the sky.
[02:58:40.687 --> 02:58:43.828]  Fourth hour coming up, your calls, David Knight and more.
[02:58:43.828 --> 02:58:45.149]  I'm gonna cause with David Knight, son.
[02:58:45.149 --> 02:58:45.789]  Let's get him in here.
[02:58:49.207 --> 02:58:53.950]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.
[02:58:53.950 --> 02:58:58.372]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.
[02:58:58.372 --> 02:59:08.978]  InfoWars Life has set out to bring you formulations that are not only the highest quality out there, but formulas that you can use on a daily basis to give your body the natural herbs and extracts that our experts recommend.
[02:59:09.598 --> 02:59:17.560]  The Prostagard formula does just that, with its mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants that help give your body total support.
[02:59:17.560 --> 02:59:26.923]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3, selenium, and copper.
[02:59:26.923 --> 02:59:37.186]  Prostagard is something that the men on the InfoWars crew take every day, and from our research, it's something that men should really be adding to their daily regimen in order to keep their body going at optimal levels.
[02:59:37.686 --> 02:59:38.966]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:13.192 --> 03:00:18.035]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:00:18.035 --> 03:00:23.439]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:23.439 --> 03:00:26.201]  Taking your phone calls, David Knight's coming in.
[03:00:26.201 --> 03:00:27.342]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[03:00:27.342 --> 03:00:29.463]  Who should we go to next here?
[03:00:29.463 --> 03:00:33.526]  Russell in Alaska, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[03:00:33.526 --> 03:00:34.046]  Hello?
[03:00:34.046 --> 03:00:36.028]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[03:00:36.028 --> 03:00:42.332]  Yes, hi, I'm calling about a Snapchat video that was just sent to me by a relative, specifically warning children
[03:00:42.845 --> 03:00:47.268]  Apparently Snapchat has now just put in a new feature that they didn't announce.
[03:00:47.268 --> 03:00:51.071]  It's called Snap Maps or Friend Stalker.
[03:00:51.071 --> 03:00:56.115]  That allows you to see where and what your friends are doing at all times.
[03:00:56.115 --> 03:00:58.036]  They didn't tell anybody about this.
[03:00:58.036 --> 03:01:02.860]  You can shut it off by going to a ghost feature, but there's a video on YouTube about it.
[03:01:02.860 --> 03:01:04.621]  Hold on a second.
[03:01:05.680 --> 03:01:06.682]  No, I see the articles.
[03:01:06.682 --> 03:01:07.603]  I appreciate it.
[03:01:07.603 --> 03:01:10.828]  How to turn off your Snap Map on your child's smartphone.
[03:01:10.828 --> 03:01:16.958]  All these big mega apps are Trojan horses to basically be able to track everything you do.
[03:01:16.958 --> 03:01:20.543]  Just like Pokemon Go admitted that really it was Google
[03:01:21.835 --> 03:01:26.181]  Sending you out to buy the data, you know, from the game maker.
[03:01:26.181 --> 03:01:31.669]  If you think you're going to video a monster, it just puts a monster where it wants Street View video.
[03:01:31.669 --> 03:01:36.717]  So instead of having to have vans drive around and do it or people, they've got your kids running around doing it.
[03:01:37.967 --> 03:01:40.330]  Yep, Roger, so that's just what I wanted to let you guys know.
[03:01:40.330 --> 03:01:41.732]  Like I said, I just got the video today.
[03:01:41.732 --> 03:01:42.092]  Goodbye.
[03:01:58.885 --> 03:02:00.726]  To kidnap kids, basically.
[03:02:00.726 --> 03:02:04.708]  This is government and corporations wanting into your children's lives.
[03:02:04.708 --> 03:02:11.532]  Remember 12, 14 years ago in Philadelphia, the school system gave kids laptops that taxpayers paid for.
[03:02:11.532 --> 03:02:12.312]  They weren't free.
[03:02:12.312 --> 03:02:13.273]  They called them free.
[03:02:13.273 --> 03:02:17.135]  And they were watching the kids at home and a naked girl was eating Skittles.
[03:02:18.700 --> 03:02:31.063]  So they thought they were drugs, a naked 10-year-old, and then they took the girl away or whatever, sent the police, and then of course the school was there watching them naked at home and watching them in the showers.
[03:02:31.063 --> 03:02:32.524]  This is what they do.
[03:02:32.524 --> 03:02:35.384]  But national media didn't want a discussion about that at the time, Russell.
[03:02:35.384 --> 03:02:38.125]  They didn't want a discussion about that at the time.
[03:02:38.125 --> 03:02:41.586]  And so what they did was just say, oh, we're liars, it didn't exist.
[03:02:41.586 --> 03:02:45.047]  But now notice, they've gone from it doesn't exist to just it's everywhere.
[03:02:50.444 --> 03:02:54.926]  You saying something else there?
[03:02:54.926 --> 03:02:56.908]  Yeah, it's weird how these phone systems work.
[03:02:56.908 --> 03:02:59.029]  I think phones have gotten worse, not better, sometimes.
[03:02:59.029 --> 03:03:00.950]  I mean, have you noticed cell phones?
[03:03:00.950 --> 03:03:04.752]  See, the quality's gone down unless you have a digital-to-digital connection, and it sounds great.
[03:03:04.752 --> 03:03:06.013]  It's just pure torture.
[03:03:06.013 --> 03:03:06.773]  But great point.
[03:03:06.773 --> 03:03:09.815]  I'm glad that caller called in to get that information out to us.
[03:03:09.815 --> 03:03:13.356]  Let's go to another caller here.
[03:03:13.356 --> 03:03:14.997]  Let's talk to O'Brien in Maryland.
[03:03:14.997 --> 03:03:15.838]  O'Brien, you're on the air.
[03:03:18.579 --> 03:03:21.400]  Oh, Alex, and happy 4th of July to everybody out there.
[03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:28.601]  For those who are saying that basically funk... Do me a favor, which is what I was just talking about.
[03:03:28.601 --> 03:03:34.262]  I only have one rule with calls, and I want them to be screened so that I can understand them.
[03:03:34.262 --> 03:03:37.003]  Now, maybe it's me, but I can hardly understand anybody these days.
[03:03:37.003 --> 03:03:40.864]  Can you back off your phone just a little bit?
[03:03:40.864 --> 03:03:42.364]  Uh, how's this?
[03:03:42.364 --> 03:03:43.324]  It's a little bit better.
[03:03:43.324 --> 03:03:45.245]  Go ahead.
[03:03:45.245 --> 03:03:45.565]  Well...
[03:03:46.169 --> 03:04:08.275]  Basically, everybody's saying that basically Trump isn't getting a lot of his stuff done or whatever, but basically the big one is that basically Hillary hasn't been charged, or should I say Jeff Sessions hasn't gone after Hillary Clinton, and basically with everything that's been going on there, I just need to tell people just try to be patient.
[03:04:08.275 --> 03:04:11.356]  I mean, there's a lot of people that would basically try to block
[03:04:12.370 --> 03:04:12.731]  I think so.
[03:04:25.444 --> 03:04:26.605]  We blocked him on that.
[03:04:26.605 --> 03:04:31.428]  So I think he's fine to wait for probably a second or third.
[03:04:31.428 --> 03:04:33.830]  All right, I made out about half of what you had to say.
[03:04:33.830 --> 03:04:37.172]  And I appreciate your call, because the half I got was really, really, really important.
[03:04:37.172 --> 03:04:37.733]  Thank you.
[03:04:37.733 --> 03:04:41.796]  I'm going to come back and speak to that specifically here.
[03:04:41.796 --> 03:04:45.578]  On the other side, I may go completely to our own phone system and stop using GCN.
[03:04:45.578 --> 03:04:47.720]  I think it may be their system, or God knows.
[03:04:47.720 --> 03:04:50.462]  Or maybe it's me that can't understand half of what anybody's saying anymore.
[03:04:50.982 --> 03:04:53.244]  I mean, it is just absolutely out of control.
[03:04:53.244 --> 03:04:54.085]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:54.085 --> 03:04:59.570]  I'm going to address what he was talking about, about patience with Trump.
[03:04:59.570 --> 03:05:03.013]  President Trump's tweets have sent the Democrats into a tizzy again.
[03:05:03.013 --> 03:05:13.783]  After President Trump ripped Psycho Joe and No IQ Mika last week, Trump got back on Twitter yesterday and posted a short video of himself beating up another man depicted as a CNN logo.
[03:05:13.783 --> 03:05:14.684]  A total classic.
[03:05:14.884 --> 03:05:25.730]  But the Democrats didn't appreciate Trump's animosity towards the fake news network CNN, and are now drumming up the bill for impeachment based on the 25th Amendment, citing grounds that the President is mentally unfit to serve.
[03:05:25.730 --> 03:05:31.354]  Now, this would require a medical examination, which may come back to bite the Democrats that are calling for it.
[03:05:31.354 --> 03:05:31.614]  You see,
[03:05:32.074 --> 03:05:36.439]  Given a fair examination of the President's health, Trump will pass with flying colors.
[03:05:36.439 --> 03:05:47.230]  But imagine if the tables were turned and Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders were asked to pass the same test, given the importance of their jobs.
[03:05:47.230 --> 03:05:49.732]  I wonder if they would still be pushing this bill.
[03:05:49.732 --> 03:05:51.474]  Something tells me they wouldn't be.
[03:05:51.474 --> 03:05:54.197]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:06:00.160 --> 03:06:03.943]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:06:03.943 --> 03:06:11.670]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:06:11.670 --> 03:06:20.278]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:06:20.278 --> 03:06:24.342]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:06:24.682 --> 03:06:34.524]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:06:34.524 --> 03:06:37.945]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:06:37.945 --> 03:06:48.987]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[03:08:21.004 --> 03:08:24.450]  From the Front Lines.
[03:08:24.450 --> 03:08:29.739]  From the Front Lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:29.739 --> 03:08:30.540]  Alright, Cicero.
[03:08:31.781 --> 03:08:35.922]  A few other callers I'm going to get to, then I'm going to get out of here and let David Knight host the rest of this hour.
[03:08:35.922 --> 03:08:43.484]  We are very, very close to David launching the first new broadcast here on the InfoWars Radio Network in conjunction with GCN and others.
[03:08:43.484 --> 03:08:45.084]  In the next few weeks, we're getting it done.
[03:08:45.084 --> 03:08:46.365]  The crew's coming in.
[03:08:46.365 --> 03:08:50.146]  They'll launch that at 8 o'clock in the morning every day until noon.
[03:08:51.647 --> 03:08:56.312]  When I join you, or I guess 9 to noon, depending on how many hours we decide to kick this off.
[03:08:56.312 --> 03:08:57.914]  Then we're going to have some other broadcasts.
[03:08:57.914 --> 03:09:04.261]  They're going to be starting tailored towards syndication on radio, but also having the television dimension.
[03:09:04.261 --> 03:09:08.646]  David's going to tell you about a few of the stories he's got coming up before I go back to your calls.
[03:09:08.646 --> 03:09:10.909]  And then I'm going to answer a question from the last caller.
[03:09:11.943 --> 03:09:14.705]  Telling everybody, we really need to give Trump patience.
[03:09:14.705 --> 03:09:16.086]  Well, I mean, it's beyond that.
[03:09:16.086 --> 03:09:18.328]  The elites of the globe are after him.
[03:09:18.328 --> 03:09:22.290]  He has rightfully come out and said, just repeal Obamacare if you can't do it right.
[03:09:22.290 --> 03:09:26.674]  He's trying to bring forward good tax cuts for everybody and restart the economy.
[03:09:26.674 --> 03:09:34.779]  We know those bring in more money when you cut taxes and you do it right than higher taxes do, because it gets the economy going.
[03:09:34.779 --> 03:09:39.002]  We know that he's killing globalists, you know, star in the crown.
[03:09:40.163 --> 03:09:45.770]  Jewel of the Crown events like the TPP, like the carbon tax, securing the borders.
[03:09:45.770 --> 03:09:49.013]  They hate him, the pedophile Pope, all of them.
[03:09:49.013 --> 03:09:50.535]  There is an ongoing war.
[03:09:50.535 --> 03:09:52.517]  He's going after the pedophile rings.
[03:09:52.517 --> 03:09:54.500]  Trump is listening to this broadcast.
[03:09:54.500 --> 03:09:55.301]  Trump is awake.
[03:09:55.301 --> 03:09:58.084]  And so they are in full hysteria mode.
[03:09:58.084 --> 03:09:59.205]  So to answer your question, sir,
[03:10:00.366 --> 03:10:00.967]  Absolutely.
[03:10:00.967 --> 03:10:04.629]  People should understand that we're in the battle with Trump.
[03:10:04.629 --> 03:10:06.870]  If he goes sideways, we'll expose him.
[03:10:06.870 --> 03:10:10.932]  The fact is, though, Trump understands this wave of awakening is here.
[03:10:10.932 --> 03:10:13.034]  We're all in this together.
[03:10:13.034 --> 03:10:18.237]  And the globalists know that if they can make him lose his 30% of the population, he's only about half voted.
[03:10:18.757 --> 03:10:22.281]  He has 30% of the population that supports him, then he's a dead duck.
[03:10:22.281 --> 03:10:27.748]  We'll be destroying our own vanguard trying to fix things and change things.
[03:10:27.748 --> 03:10:29.490]  Turning the coal back on.
[03:10:29.490 --> 03:10:31.192]  Giving us cheap energy again.
[03:10:31.192 --> 03:10:33.454]  Look at energy prices dropping again.
[03:10:33.454 --> 03:10:35.056]  Look at everything Trump's doing.
[03:10:35.776 --> 03:10:48.771]  The problem is, and I'm sure you'll play the footage later that oh and God I meant to get to it, of downtown Austin, the communists, the anti-fascists, again that's an oxymoron, the Soros fascists, coming up screaming, yelling mindlessly, hatefully.
[03:10:48.771 --> 03:10:52.555]  These people are literal mind control victims, drooling idiots.
[03:10:52.555 --> 03:10:52.976]  David Knight?
[03:10:53.643 --> 03:10:54.744]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[03:10:54.744 --> 03:11:00.370]  And when we look at what's going on with Obamacare, I think it's very important to see what Trump has started doing this last weekend.
[03:11:00.370 --> 03:11:05.515]  He tweeted out on Friday, hey, if we can't get this solved, let's just go with repeal.
[03:11:05.515 --> 03:11:09.578]  And now we have that movement building over the weekend on several Sunday shows.
[03:11:09.578 --> 03:11:13.823]  We've had a lot of senators coming out and saying, that's the thing that we need to do.
[03:11:13.823 --> 03:11:15.664]  And I think that that's really the key.
[03:11:15.664 --> 03:11:16.966]  It's almost, Alex, when you look at it,
[03:11:17.466 --> 03:11:24.853]  It's almost like these multilateral trade deals that they try to get through and they can't get these multilateral trade deals through because they're so complicated.
[03:11:24.853 --> 03:11:26.914]  Even a bilateral trade deal is complicated.
[03:11:26.914 --> 03:11:37.203]  But of course, we also know the multilateral trade deals are about setting up a third party system, a new form of government that makes the decisions.
[03:11:37.203 --> 03:11:37.664]  Exactly.
[03:11:37.904 --> 03:11:46.491]  The politicians are voting to create a new global system of government, tax-exempt, separate from us, and transferring power to a new entity.
[03:11:46.491 --> 03:11:58.321]  It's total fraud, like if somebody inside your business who's a manager, through white paper fraud, through executive fraud, sits there and sets up a new company and transfers all the ownership and control to that company.
[03:11:58.701 --> 03:12:07.287]  Exactly, and the key thing about Obamacare, and the progressives understand this, we've had Senator Elizabeth Warren coming out and saying... She said it's about single-payer, it's about destroying it!
[03:12:07.287 --> 03:12:22.417]  That's where it is going, and so we're going to take a look... But again, we're conspiracy theorists because we heard Ezekiel Emanuel that wrote it, saying it's meant to destroy the current system, it's meant to bankrupt it, and have private interest make you be a single-payer and pay whatever they want to make you.
[03:12:22.417 --> 03:12:27.000]  It's about private corporations raping you with a Republican establishment behind it.
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:28.401]  We're proven totally right!
[03:12:28.801 --> 03:12:30.963]  And they turn around and call us conspiracy theorists.
[03:12:30.963 --> 03:12:32.124]  It's crony capitalism.
[03:12:32.124 --> 03:12:33.825]  It's economic fascism.
[03:12:33.825 --> 03:12:35.486]  It is death panels.
[03:12:35.486 --> 03:12:36.547]  Let's just put it that way.
[03:12:36.547 --> 03:12:41.670]  And a good example of this, we're going to talk about this today, is this child in England who has a very rare disease.
[03:12:41.670 --> 03:12:43.232]  They have an experimental treatment.
[03:12:43.232 --> 03:12:50.497]  They would like to at least try that, have a GoFundMe experiment, but these people do not have the legal right to do that.
[03:12:50.497 --> 03:12:57.542]  When you have a single-payer system, the doctors and the hospitals can't contribute their, can't give free health care to people.
[03:12:57.822 --> 03:13:03.544]  They won't even allow this child to go home to die, even though the parents said we will pay for it.
[03:13:03.544 --> 03:13:06.024]  That's the tyranny of single-payer.
[03:13:06.024 --> 03:13:20.589]  That's what we're going to get if the progressives are allowed to continue down this path of Obamacare, just as Alex pointed out, that is designed to destroy the healthcare system that we have here, to make it such a basket case that the government steps in and says, don't worry,
[03:13:21.129 --> 03:13:23.031]  We'll provide free health care for everyone.
[03:13:23.031 --> 03:13:34.442]  And then only a select few mega-corporation banks that own the insurance companies who wrote it to begin with as a weapon to bankrupt our economy, consolidate control, and that's their admission.
[03:13:34.442 --> 03:13:40.488]  That's what's so frustrating, is that just like, here's a microcosm, I'll take a few final calls because you're taking over.
[03:13:40.488 --> 03:13:42.470]  We wrote an article 11, 12 days ago, I guess 13 days ago,
[03:13:45.842 --> 03:13:49.665]  Mike Barrett for Infowars.com, linking directly to the U.S.
[03:13:49.665 --> 03:13:56.609]  Geological Survey and the Fish and Wildlife Service that does the main stocking in the ocean, but also in the rivers, streams, and lakes.
[03:13:56.609 --> 03:14:03.293]  The fact that 85% of one species, but all the species, are basically becoming bisexual or, quote, gay.
[03:14:03.293 --> 03:14:05.835]  The male fish only want to have sex with males.
[03:14:05.835 --> 03:14:08.077]  And that's what these chemicals that we're drinking do.
[03:14:08.877 --> 03:14:24.854]  Then I've got all these government documents written by White House science czar John P. Holdren, back when he wasn't even in the administration of Obama, saying this was the plan in 1974, and then they make jokes about the gay frogs and the gay fish.
[03:14:24.854 --> 03:14:26.195]  We broke this weeks ago.
[03:14:27.219 --> 03:14:35.123]  And then here it is in a stack of news today, London Telegraph Associated Press reporting on the exact same fish and wildlife report.
[03:14:35.123 --> 03:14:36.384]  Now here's the issue.
[03:14:36.384 --> 03:14:42.006]  That would have never been in the London Telegraph or anywhere if we wouldn't have first published it and linked to it.
[03:14:42.006 --> 03:14:43.647]  That's what InfoWars does.
[03:14:43.647 --> 03:14:45.208]  It's not that we're that special.
[03:14:45.208 --> 03:14:48.530]  If the media did its job, there'd be so much competition, we wouldn't exist like that.
[03:14:49.230 --> 03:14:52.213]  It's that they aren't supposed to report on that.
[03:14:52.213 --> 03:14:53.975]  We force them to.
[03:14:53.975 --> 03:14:55.937]  That's our real value.
[03:14:55.937 --> 03:14:56.717]  That's what we do.
[03:14:56.717 --> 03:15:02.363]  So it doesn't work anymore just coming out and saying that we're liars, we're kooks.
[03:15:02.363 --> 03:15:03.864]  No, the fish aren't gay.
[03:15:03.864 --> 03:15:05.126]  This is blown up in their face.
[03:15:05.126 --> 03:15:06.327]  And that's what our job is.
[03:15:06.607 --> 03:15:09.969]  And what they try to do is to try to destroy you by ridicule.
[03:15:09.969 --> 03:15:12.291]  They say, oh, you're talking about gay frogs again.
[03:15:12.291 --> 03:15:15.954]  And it's like, this is a government report that we're talking about here.
[03:15:15.954 --> 03:15:21.297]  And when you look at what's happening to the fish, what's happening to those of us who are drinking municipal water?
[03:15:21.297 --> 03:15:23.879]  Because municipal water doesn't filter out these chemicals.
[03:15:23.879 --> 03:15:24.480]  It's the same runoff.
[03:15:24.480 --> 03:15:24.860]  Exactly.
[03:15:25.680 --> 03:15:32.883]  You wonder why women are hyper-feminized and getting accelerated cancers in their hormone-based tissues, and why boys are acting effeminate.
[03:15:32.883 --> 03:15:43.568]  It's a fact that they admit the studies in these articles, where they're doing it with mammals, fish, and amphibians, turning them female, and turning them bisexual, and quote, testing.
[03:15:43.568 --> 03:15:44.568]  Yes.
[03:15:44.568 --> 03:15:47.029]  So regardless, they know all this.
[03:15:47.029 --> 03:15:47.690]  Now separately,
[03:15:48.658 --> 03:15:50.999]  I don't want to bash Robert David Steele.
[03:15:50.999 --> 03:16:02.043]  I'm going to get him back on, but he's a former CIA guy, pretty high level, in actual covert operations on the ground, a case manager, never talks about space aliens, all the stuff we don't touch.
[03:16:02.043 --> 03:16:03.244]  He comes on in the middle.
[03:16:03.244 --> 03:16:05.744]  I'm going to skip this network break so we have more time.
[03:16:05.744 --> 03:16:06.425]  He comes on.
[03:16:07.714 --> 03:16:16.903]  In the middle of a discussion about the Pope's right-hand man, number three in the Vatican, caught procuring hundreds of young boys, indicted for raping them, admitting he knew about rapes and did nothing.
[03:16:16.903 --> 03:16:17.143]  Yeah.
[03:16:17.143 --> 03:16:17.904]  Okay?
[03:16:17.904 --> 03:16:21.988]  And then he blurts out, he blurts out, oh yeah, like they've got slave colonies on Mars.
[03:16:21.988 --> 03:16:23.529]  I say, I don't know about that.
[03:16:23.529 --> 03:16:24.811]  I don't agree with that.
[03:16:24.811 --> 03:16:27.573]  There are secret programs in space, but those are for weapon systems.
[03:16:27.573 --> 03:16:28.454]  That's admitted.
[03:16:28.454 --> 03:16:29.716]  It's secret weaponization of space.
[03:16:30.785 --> 03:16:35.669]  They now put in hundreds of publications that I say there's Mars bases.
[03:16:35.669 --> 03:16:35.989]  Look at this.
[03:16:35.989 --> 03:16:37.210]  Trump endorsed media.
[03:16:37.210 --> 03:16:38.410]  See, Trump.
[03:16:38.410 --> 03:16:40.012]  Now it's to target Trump.
[03:16:40.012 --> 03:16:41.413]  So first, I didn't say it.
[03:16:41.413 --> 03:16:43.514]  So then they say I said something I didn't say.
[03:16:43.514 --> 03:16:47.117]  Then they say Trump endorsed media says this.
[03:16:47.117 --> 03:16:48.277]  This is out of slate.
[03:16:48.277 --> 03:16:52.000]  They had a NASA press conference saying this.
[03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:58.124]  Again, what do you do when everything we said about the Pope being a pedophile, reportedly, protecting pedophiles,
[03:16:59.045 --> 03:17:03.286]  Bringing in pedophiles, his top people protecting pedophiles being pedophiles.
[03:17:03.286 --> 03:17:04.546]  I go to Rome to document it.
[03:17:04.546 --> 03:17:07.867]  Name by name, it comes out what I said two years ago.
[03:17:07.867 --> 03:17:11.108]  We met with the police, you name it.
[03:17:11.108 --> 03:17:12.608]  I mean, I went to the Vatican, folks.
[03:17:12.608 --> 03:17:14.908]  The police of the Vatican are upset about this.
[03:17:14.908 --> 03:17:16.589]  Do I get some type of prize being right?
[03:17:16.589 --> 03:17:17.389]  No, no, no.
[03:17:17.389 --> 03:17:21.050]  They just say, oh, Jones believes there's sex slaves on Mars.
[03:17:21.050 --> 03:17:22.550]  See how they do it.
[03:17:22.910 --> 03:17:23.931]  Yeah.
[03:17:23.931 --> 03:17:29.294]  And that's the question, is did he do this deliberately to move this narrative away from what's really happening?
[03:17:29.294 --> 03:17:36.839]  Alex, when we went to follow the Pope and he was doing his New World Order tour, he was trying to put a moral face on the New World Order.
[03:17:36.839 --> 03:17:37.740]  Called collectivism.
[03:17:37.740 --> 03:17:38.180]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:17:38.200 --> 03:17:38.420]  I don't
[03:17:57.717 --> 03:17:59.878]  Washington to New York to Philadelphia.
[03:17:59.878 --> 03:18:03.458]  And in Philadelphia he had a world meeting of families.
[03:18:03.458 --> 03:18:06.279]  And I talked to survivors of abuse.
[03:18:06.279 --> 03:18:09.760]  It's the Survivors Network of Abuse by Priests.
[03:18:09.760 --> 03:18:11.060]  It's called SNAP.
[03:18:11.060 --> 03:18:16.561]  And I interviewed some ladies that were there because they were very concerned about what happened within the Catholic Church.
[03:18:16.561 --> 03:18:19.802]  And there was one individual that was there from Pennsylvania.
[03:18:20.482 --> 03:18:21.944]  And he had not taken action.
[03:18:21.944 --> 03:18:24.386]  He'd covered for these pedophile priests.
[03:18:24.386 --> 03:18:26.568]  They got him out of the area to another jurisdiction.
[03:18:26.568 --> 03:18:31.753]  But he was brought in by this Pope to celebrate the world meeting of families.
[03:18:31.753 --> 03:18:34.476]  That's what happens within that papal institution.
[03:18:34.476 --> 03:18:35.196]  That's right.
[03:18:35.196 --> 03:18:44.986]  In fact, the Jesuits and this Pope controlling the investigation with the Cardinal who's been indicted, they use their own investigation to blackmail the last Pope out
[03:18:45.626 --> 03:18:46.927]  To bring in this new Pope.
[03:18:46.927 --> 03:18:49.489]  You've never had two living Popes at the same time.
[03:18:49.489 --> 03:18:54.392]  I mean, this shows the amazing change that's going on in our world, David Knight.
[03:18:54.392 --> 03:18:58.474]  And you know, when Pope Francis became Pope, this was already a hot issue.
[03:18:58.474 --> 03:19:02.157]  And he said, well, I think maybe 2% of the priests are pedophiles.
[03:19:02.745 --> 03:19:04.466]  Well, that's not what Australia says.
[03:19:04.466 --> 03:19:08.827]  After a multi-year investigation, they say that it's about 7% in Australia.
[03:19:08.827 --> 03:19:10.768]  In some jurisdictions, 15%.
[03:19:10.768 --> 03:19:13.109]  And when you go higher, it's a higher percentage.
[03:19:13.109 --> 03:19:15.810]  It is a leadership mark, so they can control you.
[03:19:15.810 --> 03:19:17.150]  David, how big is it?
[03:19:17.150 --> 03:19:23.413]  Well, even if you go with this 2% figure, we did the math on it at the time, that would have been 8,000 pedophile priests.
[03:19:23.413 --> 03:19:26.414]  And at the time I interviewed those ladies who were part of SNAP,
[03:19:27.134 --> 03:19:29.214]  They said, nothing has been done.
[03:19:29.214 --> 03:19:32.235]  And it was two years after he'd become Pope, he had done absolutely nothing.
[03:19:32.235 --> 03:19:40.617]  So he admits, by his estimate, which is incredibly conservative, incredibly low, that there's 8,000 pedophile priests, but he does nothing about it for two years.
[03:19:40.617 --> 03:19:44.617]  Here we are two years later, and here's number three guy is now being indicted.
[03:19:44.617 --> 03:19:46.318]  He was in charge of the cover-up.
[03:19:46.318 --> 03:19:46.658]  Yeah.
[03:19:46.658 --> 03:19:50.158]  He ran the investigation, was quoted in newspapers last year.
[03:19:50.158 --> 03:19:53.699]  There's one of the articles saying he knew they'd been raped, but the kids didn't complain.
[03:19:54.079 --> 03:19:55.280]  Yes, yes.
[03:19:55.280 --> 03:20:07.149]  And you have people who, he created a panel of survivors of abuse by priests, and these people have been leaving the panel saying, this is nothing but a cover-up, and I'm not going to be a part of this cover-up.
[03:20:07.149 --> 03:20:10.291]  They know what they should do, they're not doing it, and so they have left.
[03:20:10.291 --> 03:20:11.712]  And that's precisely what he's done.
[03:20:11.712 --> 03:20:18.217]  Window-dressing and misdirection, which is all we ever get from these institutional pedophiles, and the Vatican is part of that.
[03:20:19.217 --> 03:20:21.219]  And remember, the pedophilia is only the gateway.
[03:20:21.219 --> 03:20:25.322]  The satanism, all of it, keeps coming out because this is psychopath test.
[03:20:25.322 --> 03:20:33.289]  The psychopaths want to test people to see if they can be compromised and see if they're like them to build this legion of evil, this legion of doom.
[03:20:33.289 --> 03:20:34.009]  Let's go ahead.
[03:20:34.009 --> 03:20:36.071]  Dennis Hastert's a great example of that, Alex.
[03:20:36.071 --> 03:20:38.393]  You know, the guy who, they handpicked this guy.
[03:20:38.953 --> 03:20:39.153]  I think?
[03:20:55.660 --> 03:20:59.903]  And doing it in a way to try to hide it from the bank that was asking him questions.
[03:20:59.903 --> 03:21:01.664]  Sure, they always go with another crime.
[03:21:01.664 --> 03:21:05.967]  Like, don't get Clinton for the missile secrets to China and the nuclear reactors in North Korea.
[03:21:05.967 --> 03:21:07.108]  Okay, who's up first there?
[03:21:07.108 --> 03:21:08.509]  They went up on the 4th of July.
[03:21:08.509 --> 03:21:09.410]  I can't read that caller.
[03:21:09.410 --> 03:21:11.772]  Who's that?
[03:21:11.772 --> 03:21:12.792]  Sierra in Illinois.
[03:21:12.792 --> 03:21:13.413]  You're on the air.
[03:21:13.413 --> 03:21:13.813]  Go ahead.
[03:21:13.813 --> 03:21:16.475]  Um, yes.
[03:21:16.475 --> 03:21:17.916]  I'm Sierra.
[03:21:17.916 --> 03:21:18.516]  Yes, you are, ma'am.
[03:21:20.820 --> 03:21:23.762]  Yeah, Alex, David, good afternoon.
[03:21:23.762 --> 03:21:25.743]  Thank you.
[03:21:25.743 --> 03:21:40.230]  In 1776, July 4th, Americans officially would proclaim their independence from their version of the globalists.
[03:21:40.230 --> 03:21:40.650]  Yes.
[03:21:40.650 --> 03:21:43.391]  The English powers.
[03:21:43.391 --> 03:21:45.612]  And I think that in 2015, July 4th, you know, to be
[03:21:50.649 --> 03:21:56.177]  The day that Americans decide to declare our independence from the globalist now.
[03:21:57.048 --> 03:21:59.910]  Well, I'd advise them to step down.
[03:22:26.175 --> 03:22:27.876]  No, I agree, but what are they going to do?
[03:22:27.876 --> 03:22:29.397]  What are they going to do, David?
[03:22:29.397 --> 03:22:30.718]  I think they're going to double down.
[03:22:30.718 --> 03:22:32.740]  These people are never going to go peacefully.
[03:22:32.740 --> 03:22:38.143]  Nobody ever gives you your freedom, and the people who had Brexit 1776 understood that.
[03:22:38.143 --> 03:22:41.446]  They said, we're not going to be carried on a feather bed to a state of liberty.
[03:22:41.446 --> 03:22:43.007]  We're going to have to fight for it.
[03:22:43.007 --> 03:22:45.469]  And folks, they're going to go out fighting.
[03:22:45.469 --> 03:22:49.291]  They're going to try to tear down the temple with them when they go out.
[03:22:49.291 --> 03:22:51.753]  And that's always the way that they keep power.
[03:22:51.753 --> 03:22:52.794]  They want chaos.
[03:22:53.194 --> 03:22:59.724]  They want to destroy the order that we have now, so then out of those ruins they can build the system that they want to build.
[03:22:59.724 --> 03:23:01.587]  And that's going to be their plan.
[03:23:01.587 --> 03:23:03.289]  And really what it is, is they're destructive.
[03:23:03.289 --> 03:23:07.415]  It's a mental illness with people that they think if they tear it all down they'll be in charge.
[03:23:07.415 --> 03:23:08.497]  It never works.
[03:23:08.497 --> 03:23:08.577]  No.
[03:23:08.877 --> 03:23:11.119]  And this happens in businesses, it happens anywhere.
[03:23:11.119 --> 03:23:15.584]  Like weirdos get in and they think, if I run off all the good people, I'll be in charge.
[03:23:15.584 --> 03:23:17.186]  No, you end up running yourself off.
[03:23:17.186 --> 03:23:25.133]  It's like this weird instinct that losers have, that if there's anybody else around them that's competent, that lessens them instead of it makes them stronger.
[03:23:25.734 --> 03:23:27.154]  They're not rational.
[03:23:27.154 --> 03:23:28.095]  And they're evil.
[03:23:28.095 --> 03:23:30.055]  And they want power more than anything.
[03:23:30.055 --> 03:23:32.496]  And they'll do anything to keep that power.
[03:23:32.496 --> 03:23:34.217]  So that's what makes them so dangerous.
[03:23:34.217 --> 03:23:37.458]  That's what makes this such a dangerous situation.
[03:23:37.458 --> 03:23:39.719]  Crisis is danger and opportunity.
[03:23:39.719 --> 03:23:41.139]  That's the old Chinese symbol.
[03:23:41.139 --> 03:23:41.479]  It is.
[03:23:41.479 --> 03:23:42.499]  That's what we're in right now.
[03:23:42.499 --> 03:23:43.940]  We're in a time of crisis.
[03:23:43.940 --> 03:23:46.921]  Great danger, but also great opportunity.
[03:23:46.921 --> 03:23:49.122]  I want to play a clip again because it's so profound.
[03:23:49.122 --> 03:23:51.782]  I rarely play a clip twice in one broadcast.
[03:23:51.782 --> 03:23:52.963]  But Trump coming out.
[03:23:53.803 --> 03:24:01.748]  And saying the public has lost trust in the media, the media has destroyed its trust in the people, and there's no putting it back together again.
[03:24:01.748 --> 03:24:06.831]  They could have been more subtle about it, but no, they've been so arrogant that they have destroyed themselves.
[03:24:06.831 --> 03:24:09.613]  And I totally agree with Trump's statement on that.
[03:24:09.613 --> 03:24:10.914]  No matter how far they go,
[03:24:12.995 --> 03:24:15.678]  They're never going to be able to put the genie back in the bottle.
[03:24:15.678 --> 03:24:17.840]  Then he said, they think they're president.
[03:24:17.840 --> 03:24:18.661]  They're not.
[03:24:18.661 --> 03:24:19.341]  They lost.
[03:24:19.341 --> 03:24:19.822]  We won.
[03:24:19.822 --> 03:24:22.905]  Again, it's so profound, but it's so simple at the same time.
[03:24:22.905 --> 03:24:27.749]  And I made the point, David, before we go to this clip, Trump gives powerful close to a July rally.
[03:24:28.650 --> 03:24:47.638]  His greatest power is delivering on what he says he'll do, not caring when they attack him, making it a joke, but he's able to continue to change the subject onto what he wants to in the news cycle and play them like a fiddle because they're so narcissistic they can't even see they're being played.
[03:24:47.638 --> 03:24:49.738]  They can't even see they're losing.
[03:24:49.738 --> 03:24:56.001]  So as they double and triple and quadruple down, what are they going to do when it finally dawns on them that they're complete losers?
[03:24:56.661 --> 03:24:58.624]  Well, it's a humpty-dumpty media, isn't it?
[03:24:58.624 --> 03:25:00.426]  They've fallen down and they can't get up.
[03:25:00.426 --> 03:25:01.928]  They can't put themselves back together again.
[03:25:01.928 --> 03:25:04.612]  And the deep state can't put them together again.
[03:25:04.612 --> 03:25:05.654]  People are awakening.
[03:25:05.654 --> 03:25:12.103]  Once you wake up to something, once you realize that you've been lied to and deceived, that breaks the spell.
[03:25:12.503 --> 03:25:15.425]  It really does, and so they have a big problem right now.
[03:25:15.425 --> 03:25:22.790]  But you see people like Carl Bernstein, who has been the idol of journalists since Watergate.
[03:25:22.790 --> 03:25:25.572]  He's the venerated head of state of journalism.
[03:25:25.572 --> 03:25:26.212]  He's a joke!
[03:25:26.212 --> 03:25:33.958]  He's come out now, and he's removed this facade of rational objectivity, which was always a lie.
[03:25:34.638 --> 03:25:36.479]  Nobody is completely objective.
[03:25:36.479 --> 03:25:37.680]  Nobody is disinterested.
[03:25:37.680 --> 03:25:40.542]  The media has lowered... That's right.
[03:25:40.542 --> 03:25:48.366]  They have lowered any pretense and they're frothing piranhas that are all one-upping each other and it's a process of radicalization.
[03:25:48.366 --> 03:25:49.647]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[03:25:49.647 --> 03:25:53.529]  Trump gives powerful close to July rally.
[03:25:53.529 --> 03:25:57.512]  And though we have many stories we all share
[03:25:58.584 --> 03:26:14.750]  One home and one glorious destiny, a destiny that's getting better and better every single day.
[03:26:14.750 --> 03:26:24.654]  And whether we are black or brown or white, and you've heard me say this before, we all bleed the same red blood.
[03:26:31.201 --> 03:26:41.074]  We all salute the same great American flag.
[03:26:41.074 --> 03:26:45.761]  And we are all made by the same almighty God.
[03:27:07.338 --> 03:27:09.759]  We face many challenges.
[03:27:09.759 --> 03:27:13.600]  There are many hills and mountains to climb.
[03:27:13.600 --> 03:27:28.865]  But with the strength and courage of the patriots assembled in this room tonight, we will scare, I mean, and you see it, and you see it all the time, and we're doing it all the time, because we're scaling those summits.
[03:27:28.865 --> 03:27:33.027]  And we will get the job done.
[03:27:36.462 --> 03:27:38.430]  I mean, these are profound speeches.
[03:27:38.430 --> 03:27:40.177]  We will all prove worthy.
[03:27:41.738 --> 03:27:44.959]  Of this very important moment in history.
[03:27:44.959 --> 03:27:46.219]  There's no way he could not be real.
[03:27:46.219 --> 03:27:52.441]  We will prove worthy of the sacrifice that our brave veterans have made.
[03:27:52.441 --> 03:27:55.662]  And that's why the enemy... That's enough of the club.
[03:27:55.662 --> 03:27:58.562]  That's why the enemy is throwing everything they've got against Trump.
[03:27:58.562 --> 03:28:01.583]  David Knight's taking over here in about three minutes.
[03:28:01.583 --> 03:28:02.163]  We're going to go to break.
[03:28:02.163 --> 03:28:04.384]  He's going to take over and host the rest of the transmission.
[03:28:04.384 --> 03:28:07.185]  Nightly News coming up tonight, seven o'clock central.
[03:28:07.185 --> 03:28:08.325]  Just briefly before we go any further.
[03:28:09.145 --> 03:28:10.466]  I need to fund this operation.
[03:28:10.466 --> 03:28:12.668]  I want to launch five or six more shows.
[03:28:12.668 --> 03:28:14.849]  I want to hire 15 more people at least.
[03:28:14.849 --> 03:28:16.270]  I've got to get crew.
[03:28:16.270 --> 03:28:18.252]  I've got to get more folks to switch the cameras.
[03:28:18.252 --> 03:28:20.434]  I've got to get more writers, more researchers.
[03:28:20.434 --> 03:28:21.554]  I've got to get more reporters.
[03:28:22.543 --> 03:28:27.044]  So we can send people out in the field and have somebody in the field basically all the time.
[03:28:27.044 --> 03:28:29.405]  And that is due all because of your support.
[03:28:29.405 --> 03:28:33.686]  So imagine how far Infowars has come in fighting the globalists.
[03:28:33.686 --> 03:28:36.347]  I mean, the enemy recognizes us as one of their main enemies now.
[03:28:36.347 --> 03:28:38.067]  That's why we're attacked so much.
[03:28:38.067 --> 03:28:40.248]  Imagine what will happen if you continue to fund us.
[03:28:40.248 --> 03:28:40.848]  And I'm telling you.
[03:28:41.628 --> 03:28:43.190]  Gut health is so important.
[03:28:43.190 --> 03:28:45.932]  MycoZx is back in.
[03:28:45.932 --> 03:28:47.153]  Nobody else has got this.
[03:28:47.153 --> 03:28:48.855]  This goes after the yeast.
[03:28:48.855 --> 03:28:50.276]  This goes after the mold.
[03:28:50.276 --> 03:28:51.417]  It goes after the candida.
[03:28:51.417 --> 03:28:52.778]  It goes after the fungus.
[03:28:52.778 --> 03:28:55.661]  MycoZx is the latest probiotic.
[03:28:55.661 --> 03:28:56.261]  It's amazing.
[03:28:56.261 --> 03:28:59.785]  This is the type of stuff that's sold in super high-end clinics from doctors.
[03:29:00.996 --> 03:29:03.601]  It is wild crafted and organic.
[03:29:03.601 --> 03:29:10.916]  It is concentrated and it goes like a horse and carriage with Biome Defense 50 billion live strains per pill.
[03:29:10.916 --> 03:29:12.178]  An amazing probiotic.
[03:29:13.126 --> 03:29:16.548]  Again, the pesticides kill the good bacteria, the bad ones move in.
[03:29:16.548 --> 03:29:19.931]  You put good ones back in, it moves the bad ones out.
[03:29:19.931 --> 03:29:20.771]  It's so amazing.
[03:29:20.771 --> 03:29:25.715]  I've got a lot of friends and family and others that have had serious bowel problems.
[03:29:25.715 --> 03:29:29.037]  It's epidemic because of the pesticides and other things in the gut.
[03:29:29.037 --> 03:29:32.039]  But the answer, as so many of them have said, is probiotics.
[03:29:32.039 --> 03:29:34.140]  You add the MycoZX, it's back in stock.
[03:29:34.140 --> 03:29:37.122]  It's been sold out for close to six months.
[03:29:37.122 --> 03:29:40.365]  You add that to knock out the fungus and the mold and other garbage that builds up.
[03:29:41.065 --> 03:29:43.086]  The reports we're getting are simply amazing.
[03:29:43.086 --> 03:29:45.127]  Hundreds and hundreds of reviews.
[03:29:45.127 --> 03:29:46.147]  4.8 stars.
[03:29:46.147 --> 03:29:48.068]  We'll be back with David Knight.
[03:29:48.068 --> 03:29:49.449]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.449 --> 03:29:51.970]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.970 --> 03:29:54.671]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.665 --> 03:30:03.110]  President Trump's tweets have sent the Democrats into a tizzy again.
[03:30:03.110 --> 03:30:13.885]  After President Trump ripped Psycho Joe and NoIQ Mika last week, Trump got back on Twitter yesterday and posted a short video of himself beating up another man depicted as a CNN logo.
[03:30:13.885 --> 03:30:14.766]  A total classic.
[03:30:14.986 --> 03:30:25.828]  But the Democrats didn't appreciate Trump's animosity towards the fake news network CNN, and are now drumming up the bill for impeachment based on the 25th Amendment, citing grounds that the President is mentally unfit to serve.
[03:30:25.828 --> 03:30:31.429]  Now, this would require a medical examination, which may come back to bite the Democrats that are calling for it.
[03:30:31.429 --> 03:30:36.530]  You see, given a fair examination of the President's health, Trump will pass with flying colors.
[03:30:36.530 --> 03:30:39.391]  But imagine if the tables were turned, and Nancy Pelosi,
[03:30:39.611 --> 03:30:47.318]  Chuck Schumer, Maxine Waters, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders were asked to pass the same test, given the importance of their jobs.
[03:30:47.318 --> 03:30:49.821]  I wonder if they would still be pushing this bill.
[03:30:49.821 --> 03:30:51.562]  Something tells me they wouldn't be.
[03:30:51.562 --> 03:30:54.305]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:30:58.792 --> 03:31:07.877]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:31:07.877 --> 03:31:15.941]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:16.281 --> 03:31:21.143]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:21.143 --> 03:31:27.946]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:31:27.946 --> 03:31:35.110]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:35.110 --> 03:31:41.973]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:42.133 --> 03:31:46.620]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:46.620 --> 03:31:50.024]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:31:50.024 --> 03:31:56.314]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:31:56.314 --> 03:31:57.996]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[03:31:58.757 --> 03:32:09.340]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:32:09.340 --> 03:32:11.400]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:32:11.400 --> 03:32:14.281]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:32:14.281 --> 03:32:15.762]  It's made in the USA.
[03:32:15.762 --> 03:32:22.583]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:32:22.583 --> 03:32:23.844]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[03:32:24.684 --> 03:32:34.370]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:32:34.370 --> 03:32:51.200]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:32:51.200 --> 03:32:54.342]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:32:54.482 --> 03:33:05.153]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:33:05.153 --> 03:33:06.194]  News.
[03:33:06.194 --> 03:33:07.555]  Analysis.
[03:33:07.555 --> 03:33:08.977]  Reports.
[03:33:08.977 --> 03:33:11.920]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:11.920 --> 03:33:14.683]  And now, your host, David Knight.
[03:33:17.779 --> 03:33:25.421]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this day before Brexit 1776, the 2017 edition of that.
[03:33:25.421 --> 03:33:28.901]  I saw somebody tweet that out and I thought that was absolutely perfect.
[03:33:28.901 --> 03:33:36.523]  Because it was a globalist empire that we fought against, we wanted to have control over our own lives.
[03:33:36.523 --> 03:33:39.364]  And it was an act of secession.
[03:33:39.364 --> 03:33:42.764]  Yes, that dirty word that we keep hearing over and over again.
[03:33:42.764 --> 03:33:45.585]  And again, as we were talking about what are the globalists going to do?
[03:33:46.405 --> 03:33:47.605]  We know they're not going to go quietly.
[03:33:47.605 --> 03:33:59.868]  You know, there's certain times that we've seen in history and certain people, like between the Scandinavians, we've had Sweden, Denmark, Norway, they have, at different times, they've been consolidated together in one government.
[03:33:59.868 --> 03:34:02.149]  At other times, they've peacefully gone their own way.
[03:34:02.149 --> 03:34:03.769]  Same thing happened with Czechoslovakia.
[03:34:03.769 --> 03:34:06.870]  You had the Czech Republic, the Slovaks, they went their own ways peacefully.
[03:34:07.645 --> 03:34:11.067]  But that doesn't tend to happen in most places.
[03:34:11.067 --> 03:34:14.990]  In most places, those in power will not give it up without a fight.
[03:34:14.990 --> 03:34:18.652]  But we're going to keep trying to do this, and we're going to try to do it peacefully if we can.
[03:34:18.652 --> 03:34:20.473]  But we're going to do it one way or the other.
[03:34:20.473 --> 03:34:36.084]  Now, when we look at Obamacare, and I think this is very interesting as we see that Donald Trump tweeted out on Friday, if Republican senators are unable to pass what they're working on now, they should immediately repeal, he put uppercase, and then replace at a later date.
[03:34:36.784 --> 03:34:44.012]  And subsequent to that, we had Rand Paul, we had Ben Sasse come on and say, yeah, we'd like to see repeal first and then replace it.
[03:34:44.012 --> 03:34:49.377]  I think just from a pragmatic standpoint, that makes a great deal of sense.
[03:34:49.377 --> 03:34:55.583]  But the thing that I have always been concerned about, and I think that's why we need to have repeal first, the thing I've always been concerned about,
[03:34:56.363 --> 03:35:07.386]  Is this plan that originally came out with Paul Ryan, where phase two was going to be using the powers of the health czar that had been created, the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
[03:35:07.386 --> 03:35:16.289]  Those dictatorial powers that had been given to the health czar were then going to be used to remove some of these oppressive regulations that Obama had put on us.
[03:35:16.929 --> 03:35:31.673]  The problem with that, of course, is that if you don't repeal it, if you use the power structure, the illegitimate power structure that was put in place by Obama, that illegitimate power structure is then going to be used to attack you by the next administration.
[03:35:31.673 --> 03:35:38.074]  So you have to get rid of the unconstitutional, the tyrannical structure that has been put in place.
[03:35:38.074 --> 03:35:40.935]  So after Trump said that on Friday,
[03:35:41.892 --> 03:35:54.075]  We had a top White House official and several senators saying on the Sunday shows that Congress should consider a standalone bill to repeal Obamacare if they can't agree on how they're going to replace it.
[03:35:54.075 --> 03:35:58.036]  And this is what Mark Short, the White House's Legislative Affairs Director said.
[03:35:58.036 --> 03:36:06.799]  He said, if the replacement part is too difficult for Republicans to come together, then let's go back and take care of the first step and repeal.
[03:36:06.799 --> 03:36:07.639]  And this is what
[03:36:08.679 --> 03:36:17.047]  Short and Senator Sasse have noted, they said, you have 50 members who are on record already as having voted for that recently.
[03:36:17.047 --> 03:36:19.389]  So that is an option.
[03:36:19.389 --> 03:36:24.754]  At that point, if you repealed it, then you can come back with a replacement effort that could be more bipartisan.
[03:36:24.754 --> 03:36:32.242]  Also, Senator Mike Lee said yesterday on CBS' Face the Nation, the idea of proceeding on two separate tracks is very much worth considering.
[03:36:32.782 --> 03:36:36.183]  There is a consensus that is being built on that.
[03:36:36.183 --> 03:36:40.685]  Donald Trump is going to have to lead because you're not going to get the leadership from McConnell.
[03:36:40.685 --> 03:36:44.226]  You're not going to get the leadership from Paul Ryan.
[03:36:44.226 --> 03:36:51.229]  Those are guys who use this as a wedge issue to get elected, but they never had any interest, in my opinion, to repeal it.
[03:36:51.229 --> 03:36:52.049]  They never had a plan.
[03:36:52.927 --> 03:36:54.949]  They never had a plan to replace it.
[03:36:54.949 --> 03:36:57.952]  And if you don't have a plan, you're planning to fail.
[03:36:57.952 --> 03:36:59.813]  And that's basically what has happened.
[03:36:59.813 --> 03:37:12.325]  It's as if, after eight years of saying how they're going to get out of this, Donald Trump gets elected, said we need to replace this, we need to repeal it and replace it, and they come out as if they had never heard of the idea before.
[03:37:12.325 --> 03:37:17.270]  These are people who have run election after election to get elected, saying we're going to repeal and replace it.
[03:37:17.830 --> 03:37:19.251]  But they had no plan.
[03:37:19.251 --> 03:37:23.773]  They hit the ground flat-footed weeks after Donald Trump took office.
[03:37:23.773 --> 03:37:25.494]  They still didn't have a plan.
[03:37:25.494 --> 03:37:26.955]  And they still haven't crafted anything.
[03:37:26.955 --> 03:37:33.619]  And the way that they've done it, by doing it in secret, dropping this massive bill on people, was designed to fail.
[03:37:34.199 --> 03:37:38.641]  So now we have Mike Lee, we have Ted Cruz coming out and saying let's repeal it.
[03:37:38.641 --> 03:37:43.203]  We've got a consensus building with the people who are the conservatives.
[03:37:43.203 --> 03:37:47.285]  The people who campaigned against Obamacare and really meant it.
[03:37:47.285 --> 03:37:54.508]  Remember that we've got the GOP establishment that, as Elizabeth Warren said, we have tried a Republican plan.
[03:37:55.342 --> 03:37:58.725]  She pointed out that Obamacare was really Romneycare.
[03:37:58.725 --> 03:37:59.606]  That's absolutely right.
[03:37:59.606 --> 03:38:00.647]  She's from Massachusetts.
[03:38:00.647 --> 03:38:09.836]  She knows that what we had with Romneycare, that was supported also by Ted Kennedy, that that was a Republican establishment plan.
[03:38:09.836 --> 03:38:11.618]  And so they gave us a choice in 2012.
[03:38:12.839 --> 03:38:19.464]  You know, we could pick Romney or we could pick Obama, but we were going to get that health care plan that was designed to fail.
[03:38:19.464 --> 03:38:22.566]  And she knows that the next step is single payer.
[03:38:22.566 --> 03:38:27.450]  And so I want to talk about this situation that now Donald Trump, again, brought to everybody's attention.
[03:38:28.490 --> 03:38:32.431]  The Pope came out and said something that was basically non-committal.
[03:38:32.431 --> 03:38:36.152]  Saying, oh, I really feel your pain, but he's not going to say what should be done.
[03:38:36.152 --> 03:38:38.633]  But Trump says, hey, if I can help, let me know.
[03:38:38.633 --> 03:38:53.197]  Because this is a child, Charlie Gard, who last week got word that all his appeals for health care were going to be shut down by the compassionate single-payer health system of the UK, the National Health System.
[03:38:53.933 --> 03:38:58.656]  They were not going to allow him to transfer to the United States for an experimental treatment.
[03:38:58.656 --> 03:38:59.656]  Now, that wasn't going to be allowed.
[03:38:59.656 --> 03:39:04.439]  They had a GoFundMe campaign, and it was a long shot, but it was their only shot.
[03:39:04.439 --> 03:39:06.340]  And they said, no, you're not going to be allowed to take that.
[03:39:07.199 --> 03:39:17.087]  Then they came back and they appealed that through the British courts and they repealed it to the European Commission or whatever, some European court.
[03:39:17.087 --> 03:39:20.510]  All of these courts are nothing but death panels, folks.
[03:39:20.510 --> 03:39:22.612]  That's what we said from the very beginning, wasn't it?
[03:39:22.612 --> 03:39:30.899]  When the government controls your health care, and that's what single payer is, that means that the government is going to control everything about your health care.
[03:39:30.899 --> 03:39:33.942]  If doctors want to donate their services, not going to be allowed.
[03:39:34.582 --> 03:39:38.264]  If hospitals want to donate their services, not going to be allowed.
[03:39:38.264 --> 03:39:43.067]  If the public wants to get together in a GoFundMe campaign, not going to be allowed.
[03:39:43.067 --> 03:39:48.850]  So you have to understand that in the real world, everything is rationed, and that includes health care.
[03:39:48.850 --> 03:39:51.592]  It's going to be rationed one way or the other.
[03:39:51.592 --> 03:39:53.633]  The question is, who's going to make these decisions?
[03:39:54.668 --> 03:40:02.614]  And as long as you've got a free market, you can always have people come together and make an exception to the rule, come together to help an individual like this.
[03:40:02.614 --> 03:40:12.461]  But if you have single-payer health care, you're going to have a heartless bureaucracy that is going to dictate the terms of your health care, dictate the terms of everyone's health care.
[03:40:12.461 --> 03:40:15.383]  And they're not going to allow any exceptions at all.
[03:40:15.383 --> 03:40:18.345]  I want to play you what the parents had to say.
[03:40:19.474 --> 03:40:23.316]  After they learned that their child had been given a death sentence.
[03:40:23.316 --> 03:40:26.577]  So they looked at it and they said, well we've got three choices.
[03:40:26.577 --> 03:40:30.178]  And one of those choices that we would like to do is to bring the child home.
[03:40:30.178 --> 03:40:37.341]  And I want you to hear what they say the government, the compassionate government, the single-payer system told them.
[03:40:37.341 --> 03:40:39.122]  Here's that clip.
[03:40:39.122 --> 03:40:41.983]  And we had three options.
[03:40:41.983 --> 03:40:44.464]  One option was to let Charlie go in the hospital.
[03:40:44.464 --> 03:40:46.905]  The other option was to let Charlie go to a hospice.
[03:40:47.702 --> 03:40:52.303]  And the third option was to let Charlie go home to die.
[03:40:52.303 --> 03:40:55.484]  So we chose to take Charlie home to die.
[03:40:55.484 --> 03:40:59.046]  And we have said this for months, that that is what we want.
[03:40:59.046 --> 03:41:03.447]  That is our last wish, if it went this way, the way it's gone.
[03:41:03.447 --> 03:41:06.948]  And we promised our little boy every single day that we would take him home.
[03:41:06.948 --> 03:41:09.669]  Because that is a promise we thought we could keep.
[03:41:11.243 --> 03:41:13.985]  We want to give him a bath at home.
[03:41:13.985 --> 03:41:15.326]  We want to sit on the sofa with him.
[03:41:15.326 --> 03:41:17.128]  We want to sleep in the bed with him.
[03:41:17.128 --> 03:41:18.689]  We want to put him in a cot.
[03:41:18.689 --> 03:41:21.551]  He's never slept in.
[03:41:21.551 --> 03:41:22.812]  But we're now being denied that.
[03:41:23.733 --> 03:41:31.416]  Um, you know, we had a meeting yesterday where we were told we were going to discuss our options.
[03:41:31.416 --> 03:41:34.717]  And, you know, we said we'd like to take him home.
[03:41:34.717 --> 03:41:37.577]  If that's not possible, can we take him to a hospice?
[03:41:37.577 --> 03:41:38.978]  They said no to both.
[03:41:38.978 --> 03:41:43.939]  He has to die in that hospital tomorrow.
[03:41:43.939 --> 03:41:51.802]  They said they couldn't get transport to take us home, so we've offered to pay for that privately with a private team, and they said that that's not an option.
[03:41:53.596 --> 03:41:55.997]  Let's stop it at that point.
[03:41:55.997 --> 03:41:56.938]  So here they are.
[03:41:56.938 --> 03:42:09.985]  They've been told by the courts, by the single-payer government system, no, we're not going to allow you to have your child travel to get experimental treatment in the United States, even if you pay for it with the GoFundMe thing.
[03:42:09.985 --> 03:42:12.086]  No, your child is going to be killed.
[03:42:12.086 --> 03:42:13.087]  Your child is going to be killed.
[03:42:13.087 --> 03:42:14.167]  That was last Tuesday.
[03:42:14.167 --> 03:42:19.550]  We're going to take your child off of life support and kill him on Friday.
[03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:20.151]  And they said, well,
[03:42:21.788 --> 03:42:26.211]  Can we, instead of letting him die in the hospital, can we take him home?
[03:42:26.211 --> 03:42:27.692]  We would like to spend some time with him.
[03:42:27.692 --> 03:42:29.814]  We've been talking to him about this.
[03:42:29.814 --> 03:42:31.255]  And they said, no, you can't do that.
[03:42:31.255 --> 03:42:32.016]  We don't have any money for it.
[03:42:32.016 --> 03:42:32.696]  We'll pay for it.
[03:42:32.696 --> 03:42:33.176]  No, no, no.
[03:42:33.176 --> 03:42:33.917]  That's not an option.
[03:42:33.917 --> 03:42:34.638]  You can't pay for it.
[03:42:34.638 --> 03:42:35.939]  It's a single payer.
[03:42:35.939 --> 03:42:37.320]  Single payer.
[03:42:37.320 --> 03:42:39.341]  No exceptions to this bureaucratic rule.
[03:42:39.341 --> 03:42:40.922]  Remember what George Washington said.
[03:42:40.922 --> 03:42:42.684]  This is something we should think about this Fourth of July.
[03:42:43.433 --> 03:42:49.078]  He said government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is not compassion, it is force.
[03:42:49.078 --> 03:42:50.760]  It is force.
[03:42:50.760 --> 03:42:59.668]  And what we're talking about here is a healthcare that is operated by force, not by eloquence or reason or compassion, but by force.
[03:43:01.175 --> 03:43:06.740]  And like fire, it is a fearful servant and a dreadful master.
[03:43:06.740 --> 03:43:13.385]  I will not be mastered by a government healthcare system and you better not let this happen either.
[03:43:13.385 --> 03:43:16.027]  The only way we're going to stop this, one of us can't stand up against this.
[03:43:16.027 --> 03:43:20.932]  We're going to have to stand up against this collectively and say, the hell you're not going to take away my healthcare.
[03:43:20.932 --> 03:43:22.513]  You're not going to do this to my children.
[03:43:22.513 --> 03:43:26.216]  You're not going to do it to my grandchildren.
[03:43:26.216 --> 03:43:28.318]  And I want to read you what the Washington Post said
[03:43:29.048 --> 03:43:33.191]  This last weekend, a British couple have been given more time with their terminally ill son.
[03:43:33.191 --> 03:43:33.712]  Isn't that nice?
[03:43:33.712 --> 03:43:35.573]  They gave them a bit of a reprieve.
[03:43:35.573 --> 03:43:36.974]  Still not going to let him go home.
[03:43:36.974 --> 03:43:39.076]  Still not going to let him go to hospice.
[03:43:39.076 --> 03:43:44.000]  Still not going to let them go to the United States for an experimental treatment.
[03:43:44.000 --> 03:43:52.726]  But the Washington Post, statists that they are, put their little spin on it and say, well, they've given them some more time with their terminally ill son.
[03:43:52.726 --> 03:43:54.227]  So they're not going to kill him just yet.
[03:43:54.227 --> 03:43:55.789]  We'll just let this play out a little bit longer.
[03:43:55.789 --> 03:43:58.471]  They say British courts decided that Charlie should be allowed to die.
[03:43:59.272 --> 03:44:02.993]  After a legal battle in which doctors asserted the child had no chance of survival.
[03:44:02.993 --> 03:44:04.153]  That's their opinion.
[03:44:04.153 --> 03:44:08.175]  And Charlie's parents argued that there was an experimental treatment in the U.S.
[03:44:08.175 --> 03:44:09.495]  that they had not tried.
[03:44:09.495 --> 03:44:11.676]  They took it all the way to the European Court of Human Rights.
[03:44:11.676 --> 03:44:13.236]  What a joke.
[03:44:13.236 --> 03:44:14.717]  Court of Human Rights.
[03:44:14.717 --> 03:44:18.618]  Declined to hear the case on Tuesday, upholding the previous court's rulings.
[03:44:18.618 --> 03:44:20.038]  Let's talk about the Declaration of Independence.
[03:44:20.038 --> 03:44:20.938]  Remember?
[03:44:20.938 --> 03:44:22.199]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[03:44:23.100 --> 03:44:25.961]  That we have been given these inalienable rights by our Creator.
[03:44:25.961 --> 03:44:28.822]  The first one of those that they enumerated was life.
[03:44:28.822 --> 03:44:29.202]  Life.
[03:44:29.202 --> 03:44:33.243]  If you don't have a right to life, you don't have a right to anything.
[03:44:33.243 --> 03:44:35.784]  That's your first right, is your right to life.
[03:44:35.784 --> 03:44:37.845]  This is a late-term abortion, folks.
[03:44:37.845 --> 03:44:40.226]  This is a death penalty.
[03:44:40.226 --> 03:44:42.866]  This is not what we're going to allow in this country.
[03:44:42.866 --> 03:44:45.027]  This is not what this country is about.
[03:44:45.027 --> 03:44:47.348]  Elizabeth Warren is never going to get her single-payer system.
[03:44:48.072 --> 03:44:50.093]  We will fight this to the very end.
[03:44:50.093 --> 03:44:54.677]  We will fight this as vehemently as we would fight gun confiscation.
[03:44:54.677 --> 03:44:56.238]  And for the same reasons.
[03:44:56.238 --> 03:44:59.280]  We have to understand these rights come from God.
[03:44:59.280 --> 03:45:03.703]  And we have to understand that we have the liberty to make these kinds of choices.
[03:45:03.703 --> 03:45:08.026]  That our parents have the right to make these kinds of choices about their children.
[03:45:09.176 --> 03:45:14.938]  And as they said in the video, the parents said he'd fight to the very end, but we're not allowed to fight for him anymore.
[03:45:14.938 --> 03:45:19.580]  We can't even take our own son home to die.
[03:45:19.580 --> 03:45:23.081]  And that is the saddest thing, what you just heard them say.
[03:45:23.081 --> 03:45:26.542]  The parents offered, as they said, to pay for this, but they were told it was not an option.
[03:45:27.418 --> 03:45:28.820]  Because it's single payer.
[03:45:28.820 --> 03:45:31.263]  And we're going to tell you what you can and cannot do.
[03:45:31.263 --> 03:45:43.437]  And I think it's interesting to see Barack Obama, the guy who at the beginning of his campaign could not bring himself to put his hand over his heart even when they played the National Anthem or at events.
[03:45:43.437 --> 03:45:45.760]  You have the picture that we showed yesterday, the article.
[03:45:45.760 --> 03:45:47.582]  You have Bill Richardson, even Hillary Clinton.
[03:45:48.331 --> 03:45:49.571]  Knows better than that.
[03:45:49.571 --> 03:45:57.214]  She knows that she has to at least show that she likes the United States outwardly, but Barack Obama could not hide his contempt.
[03:45:57.214 --> 03:46:02.555]  He would stand there with his hands down here like this in front of him, folded.
[03:46:02.555 --> 03:46:03.936]  He hates this country.
[03:46:03.936 --> 03:46:05.576]  And so where is he on this 4th of July?
[03:46:05.576 --> 03:46:08.177]  He's in the country that he grew up in.
[03:46:08.177 --> 03:46:09.378]  In Indonesia.
[03:46:09.378 --> 03:46:10.498]  In Jakarta.
[03:46:10.498 --> 03:46:15.719]  And he is talking about the founding documents of the New World Order.
[03:46:15.719 --> 03:46:17.100]  The Paris Climate Agreement.
[03:46:17.938 --> 03:46:21.000]  Saying that this is just a temporary situation here with Donald Trump.
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:22.882]  We're going to get that back.
[03:46:22.882 --> 03:46:30.147]  You see, he doesn't support any of the principles that this country was founded upon.
[03:46:30.147 --> 03:46:31.648]  It's amazing when you look at it, actually.
[03:46:31.648 --> 03:46:38.693]  You know, you have Donald Trump making speeches, and as most American politicians would, he talks about the founding document of this country.
[03:46:38.693 --> 03:46:40.354]  He quotes the Declaration of Independence.
[03:46:41.400 --> 03:46:42.740]  Not Barack Obama.
[03:46:42.740 --> 03:46:45.141]  He warns about nationalism.
[03:46:45.141 --> 03:46:50.863]  And then he talks about the founding document of the New World Order.
[03:46:50.863 --> 03:46:55.324]  Of the international order that he thinks that he's going to be in charge of.
[03:46:55.324 --> 03:47:00.366]  Is it any wonder then that we have this story that Drudge picked up from Infowars.com by Kit Daniels?
[03:47:01.738 --> 03:47:07.160]  The History Channel tweets, George Washington fighting at Gettysburg.
[03:47:07.160 --> 03:47:11.382]  On this day in 1863, the Battle of Gettysburg ends.
[03:47:11.382 --> 03:47:12.023]  That was right.
[03:47:12.023 --> 03:47:16.204]  It was on July the 3rd, and it was 1863, but it wasn't George Washington, was it?
[03:47:18.334 --> 03:47:20.255]  I mean, that's the History Channel.
[03:47:20.255 --> 03:47:26.257]  And of course, if you've seen the History Channel specials, that really shouldn't be anything of a surprise.
[03:47:26.257 --> 03:47:28.277]  But here's the thing that's really kind of interesting.
[03:47:28.277 --> 03:47:37.541]  If you understand and you know anything about Civil War history, and of course we have a purge that is going on to remove all knowledge of history.
[03:47:37.541 --> 03:47:44.463]  It's very easy when people are so ignorant about history that they can put up a picture of George Washington at the Battle of Gettysburg, isn't it?
[03:47:44.463 --> 03:47:47.424]  That's the profound ignorance that we have here in our country because
[03:47:48.064 --> 03:47:52.989]  Education is no longer about giving people the tools to do their own research.
[03:47:52.989 --> 03:47:54.970]  It's not about giving them information.
[03:47:54.970 --> 03:47:57.993]  No, it is about social engineering.
[03:47:57.993 --> 03:48:03.038]  And of course the key part of the social engineering is white skin privilege that was created by Bill Ayers.
[03:48:03.038 --> 03:48:08.042]  That's why he left the weather underground and went into education.
[03:48:08.042 --> 03:48:10.925]  Because he understood that was how you take over a country.
[03:48:10.925 --> 03:48:12.266]  And that's the way they're taking over our country.
[03:48:13.083 --> 03:48:30.031]  People like Bill Ayers, people like Nikki Haley, who used the photograph of that heinous murderer, Dylann Roof, has a Confederate flag in the back, and so therefore we have to remove all vestiges of history, regardless of how ignorant we are of it.
[03:48:30.031 --> 03:48:36.815]  Understand that the way the South saw this battle, and one of the reasons that Gettysburg was such a disaster,
[03:48:37.762 --> 03:48:42.165]  Was because Robert E. Lee saw it as the second war of independence.
[03:48:42.165 --> 03:48:43.606]  And it truly was.
[03:48:43.606 --> 03:48:45.847]  Our first war was a war of secession.
[03:48:45.847 --> 03:48:48.409]  Our second war was a war of secession.
[03:48:48.409 --> 03:48:51.851]  Of people who decided that they were going to control us from afar.
[03:48:51.851 --> 03:48:58.496]  Does it matter if that government is a hundred miles away, or if it's a thousand miles away, or if it's five thousand miles away, or if it's on the other side of the ocean?
[03:48:58.496 --> 03:48:59.336]  No.
[03:48:59.336 --> 03:49:01.058]  We want the right of self-determination.
[03:49:01.854 --> 03:49:03.315]  That's what America was founded upon.
[03:49:03.315 --> 03:49:05.276]  That's what they fought against.
[03:49:05.276 --> 03:49:08.959]  You talk about the economic issues.
[03:49:08.959 --> 03:49:11.820]  Very few people in the South owned slaves.
[03:49:11.820 --> 03:49:13.722]  It was a rich man's fight, as many have said.
[03:49:13.722 --> 03:49:16.623]  A rich man's war, but a poor man's fight.
[03:49:16.623 --> 03:49:21.927]  Most of the people who were involved there saw it as a war of northern aggression.
[03:49:22.830 --> 03:49:23.951]  That's what they were fighting for.
[03:49:23.951 --> 03:49:25.913]  They were fighting for their independence.
[03:49:25.913 --> 03:49:30.597]  And if you want to go back and look at the charges of racism, look at what Abraham Lincoln said.
[03:49:30.597 --> 03:49:37.502]  Abraham Lincoln sounded like David Duke when he was talking about his race versus that race and how he wanted supremacy of that.
[03:49:37.502 --> 03:49:42.647]  For the most part, in the South, the leaders who owned slaves saw this as a kind of paternalism.
[03:49:43.715 --> 03:49:47.556]  And I would say it's the same kind of paternalism that we're now being sold with Obamacare.
[03:49:47.556 --> 03:49:50.216]  That we are going to take care of these people.
[03:49:50.216 --> 03:49:53.797]  Whether that's really what they believe or not, that was the way they sold it.
[03:49:53.797 --> 03:49:55.837]  Yes, it was their self-interest to have slaves.
[03:49:55.837 --> 03:49:59.018]  And yes, it was absolutely indefensible to have slaves.
[03:49:59.018 --> 03:50:01.379]  But now we're all slaves, aren't we?
[03:50:01.379 --> 03:50:07.880]  They abolished individual slavery, but now we have a situation where we're all on Washington's plantation.
[03:50:07.880 --> 03:50:12.901]  And we are going to be irrevocably on that plantation if we have a single-payer system.
[03:50:13.772 --> 03:50:14.853]  That's what they have tried to do.
[03:50:14.853 --> 03:50:17.374]  And of course, the South saw what was going on.
[03:50:17.374 --> 03:50:22.377]  They understood that the economic issues that were involved were much larger than just the slavery economic issues.
[03:50:23.035 --> 03:50:30.798]  There were issues of trade, of internal improvements as they called it, which today is really kind of crony capitalism.
[03:50:30.798 --> 03:50:35.361]  Taking money from one section of the country for internal projects in another part of the area.
[03:50:35.361 --> 03:50:38.242]  That's what they were fighting against.
[03:50:38.242 --> 03:50:40.903]  That's what they were standing against.
[03:50:40.903 --> 03:50:43.844]  But we don't even know who the players were.
[03:50:43.844 --> 03:50:49.347]  But we're taking down the monuments all over this country to our independence.
[03:50:49.347 --> 03:50:50.807]  To the spirit of independence.
[03:50:50.807 --> 03:50:51.868]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:50:58.897 --> 03:51:04.842]  The Genesis Communications Network is one of America's premier broadcasters of captivating talk radio.

[03:52:00.098 --> 03:52:12.487]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[03:52:12.487 --> 03:52:17.531]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country.

[03:54:04.881 --> 03:54:10.214]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this July 3rd, 2017.
[03:54:12.878 --> 03:54:18.643]  I want to remind you that we have our 4th of July Summer Mega Special that is now live at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:54:18.643 --> 03:54:20.445]  Free shipping store-wide.
[03:54:20.445 --> 03:54:32.435]  And we have 30% off items, very popular items like Rainforce Plus, Super Mail Vitality, Survival Shield X2, Nascent Iodine, Z-Shield that Alex was just talking about about a half hour ago.
[03:54:32.435 --> 03:54:33.716]  30% off all of those.
[03:54:33.716 --> 03:54:37.780]  30 to 40% off InfoWare Select storable food.
[03:54:37.780 --> 03:54:39.602]  And again, remember, free shipping.
[03:54:40.262 --> 03:54:45.504]  Great time to stock up on this, to get it at a huge discount and free shipping.
[03:54:45.504 --> 03:54:46.945]  It's something that's very expensive to ship.
[03:54:46.945 --> 03:54:52.328]  Take advantage of this, and this is something that's going to last for 25 years.
[03:54:52.328 --> 03:54:57.610]  All made in America, GMO free, and resealable once you decide to open it.
[03:54:57.610 --> 03:54:59.031]  You can reseal it and use it for
[03:55:00.262 --> 03:55:00.782]  A little bit longer.
[03:55:00.782 --> 03:55:04.746]  It's not going to last for another 25 years once you reseal it and seal it back up.
[03:55:04.746 --> 03:55:08.268]  But its initial seal is going to last that for 25 years.
[03:55:08.268 --> 03:55:18.016]  And again, you can protect yourself against not only shortages at times of emergency, but you can also protect yourself against spikes in food prices that may happen.

[03:55:32.285 --> 03:55:34.167]  It's DEET free, folks.
[03:55:34.167 --> 03:55:36.668]  And also Living Defense, 20% off.
[03:55:36.668 --> 03:55:41.912]  And again, storewide, free shipping at InfoWarsStore.com, part of our 4th of July special.
[03:55:42.432 --> 03:55:57.083]  You know, one of the things that I got off on a tangent, I said, you know, they saw this, one of the names that Lee and others, we look at this history channel, talking about the Battle of Gettysburg ending today in 1863, but then showing George Washington.
[03:55:57.083 --> 03:56:04.809]  One of the reasons that Robert E. Lee fought that and made that disastrous charge was because he had convinced himself
[03:56:05.649 --> 03:56:09.492]  That this was a righteous cause, just like the First War of Independence.
[03:56:09.492 --> 03:56:11.733]  They called it the Second War of Independence.
[03:56:11.733 --> 03:56:18.578]  And he believed that God was going to deliver victory into his hands to coincide with the Fourth of July.
[03:56:18.578 --> 03:56:20.459]  Now, he was wrong about that, obviously.
[03:56:20.459 --> 03:56:26.003]  And we, a lot of times, look at things and we'll convince ourselves that God has given us a sign or whatever.
[03:56:26.003 --> 03:56:27.124]  That's a very dangerous thing.
[03:56:27.124 --> 03:56:27.884]  A lot of people died.
[03:56:27.884 --> 03:56:30.927]  It was tremendous slaughter in Pickett's Charge.
[03:56:31.767 --> 03:56:36.890]  But that was an insight into how they viewed the war.
[03:56:36.890 --> 03:56:45.154]  With the exception of Nathan Bedford Forrest, I can't think of anybody that was a general in the South that was really fighting to preserve slavery.
[03:56:45.154 --> 03:56:46.675]  They all knew it was finished.
[03:56:47.580 --> 03:56:56.789]  They had already seen that in the Bahamas, the British Empire had ended slavery by compensating the plantation owners.
[03:56:56.789 --> 03:57:09.282]  That could have avoided a lot of bloodshed, and they could have done that for less than the amount of money they spent on ammunition, let alone the disaster that happened in terms of human life, in terms of the destruction.
[03:57:10.137 --> 03:57:19.818]  But we need to remember on this day and again on tomorrow, the 4th of July, we need to remember that the key thing for all of us is liberty.
[03:57:19.818 --> 03:57:20.680]  And it's not just about
[03:57:21.707 --> 03:57:25.450]  The slavery that was ended with the end of the Civil War.
[03:57:25.450 --> 03:57:28.031]  We need to understand that there are other forms of slavery.
[03:57:28.031 --> 03:57:31.013]  You know, we're talking about Obama being in Indonesia.
[03:57:31.013 --> 03:57:39.179]  Think about the fact about how, when we go back to the Declaration of Independence, that Obama erected multitudes of new offices.
[03:57:39.179 --> 03:57:47.004]  And he sent swarms of officers, 17,000 IRS agents, to harass our people and eat out their substance.
[03:57:47.004 --> 03:57:48.425]  That was a key part of Obamacare.
[03:57:49.125 --> 03:57:51.307]  That was the kind of guy that we have.
[03:57:51.307 --> 03:57:55.550]  We have to make sure that we declare our independence from that.
[03:57:55.550 --> 03:58:07.059]  The core thing always has to be, as the Founding Fathers understood, as the people who were fighting in the Civil War understood, the key thing has to be liberty.
[03:58:07.059 --> 03:58:08.541]  We have to fight for our liberty.
[03:58:09.392 --> 03:58:11.874]  And this is the thing that we need to look at tomorrow.
[03:58:11.874 --> 03:58:12.814]  I think it'd be interesting.
[03:58:12.814 --> 03:58:16.797]  I don't see presidents reading the Declaration of Independence.
[03:58:16.797 --> 03:58:21.520]  I don't think they could do that with a straight face anymore when you look at the different issues there.
[03:58:21.520 --> 03:58:25.383]  Depriving us in many cases of the benefit of trial by jury.
[03:58:25.383 --> 03:58:27.424]  How about civil asset forfeiture?
[03:58:27.424 --> 03:58:33.128]  Can we talk about the state of America with a straight face and still read the Declaration of Independence?
[03:58:33.128 --> 03:58:34.009]  I don't think we can.
[03:58:34.009 --> 03:58:35.330]  Alright, join us again.
[03:58:35.330 --> 03:58:37.171]  We're going to have a special program tomorrow.
[03:58:37.171 --> 03:58:38.652]  Join us on July the 5th as well.
