[00:00:18.427 --> 00:00:19.127]  Welcome to the year 2017.
[00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:21.588]  It's January 2nd.
[00:00:21.628 --> 00:00:24.368]  This is the first InfoWars Nightly News of the Year.
[00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:25.869]  I'm your host, Owen Schroyer.
[00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:26.929]  I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.849]  I'm Margaret Howell.
[00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.070]  And we've got a bunch of exciting stuff coming up for you.
[00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.591]  We'll take a look back at the year that was in 2016.
[00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:38.551]  We'll talk about the top stories, all of our favorite stories, all the highlights.
[00:00:38.832 --> 00:00:41.632]  We've got a report coming out also on NASA.
[00:00:41.852 --> 00:00:44.593]  We've got another report that was filed talking about AI.
[00:00:45.453 --> 00:00:48.957]  And it's intrusion into our everyday lives.
[00:00:49.017 --> 00:00:52.581]  But we've got the best stories from 2016 coming up for you.
[00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:54.463]  It's something that you're not going to want to miss.
[00:00:54.743 --> 00:00:56.144]  We're going to relive the election.
[00:00:56.425 --> 00:01:00.889]  We're going to unfortunately relive some of the more negative events from 2016 too.
[00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.234]  But 2016 was certainly a year that none of us will forget.
[00:01:05.354 --> 00:01:08.217]  A year that many of us will be telling our grandchildren.
[00:01:08.577 --> 00:01:17.268]  Or their grandchildren will tell their grandchildren and we hope that the year 2017 only offers more good news for the coming future.
[00:01:30.327 --> 00:01:36.951]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.

[00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:29.505]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:02.438 --> 00:03:05.881]  Well, 2017 is officially here, so what does that mean?
[00:03:06.242 --> 00:03:08.764]  We've got to go back and look at the biggest stories from 2016.
[00:03:09.204 --> 00:03:11.406]  Now, we've got a plethora of stories here.
[00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:13.048]  We'll try to go down the list of importance.
[00:03:13.388 --> 00:03:14.049]  We'll start with me.
[00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:15.030]  We'll go down the line here.
[00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.395]  To me, the biggest story, obviously, the election of Donald J. Trump.
[00:03:21.255 --> 00:03:21.556]  Absolutely.
[00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:23.237]  I mean, that was a huge one for me as well.
[00:03:23.697 --> 00:03:29.540]  And kind of piggybacking on that was InfoWars absolutely dominating this year.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.261]  For me, that was just a huge story.
[00:03:31.722 --> 00:03:34.423]  Hillary Clinton gave us a shout out in one of her speeches.
[00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:35.063]  She did!
[00:03:35.124 --> 00:03:39.406]  Not only that, not only the election, but do you guys remember the moment when we saw it turning?
[00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:40.807]  Because we showed up to work that day
[00:03:41.227 --> 00:03:43.149]  None of us knew Donald Trump was going to win.
[00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.309]  I resent that.
[00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.051]  I've been calling it for a long time.
[00:03:46.071 --> 00:03:48.873]  He came in with a cigar and a bottle of champagne.
[00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:52.516]  I mean, everything about that day, it was just like touch and go, touch and go.
[00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:55.017]  And you and I were sitting on the desk and it became apparent.
[00:03:55.097 --> 00:03:57.259]  It was like, holy cow.
[00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:58.120]  He has this.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.880]  He has this.
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.401]  He has this.
[00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:00.121]  It was insane.
[00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:01.903]  It was electrifying.
[00:04:01.963 --> 00:04:05.545]  I'd like to say I still have not celebrated all the way.
[00:04:05.585 --> 00:04:07.106]  Nobody knows what's going to happen.
[00:04:07.187 --> 00:04:08.468]  Is Donald Trump even going to get in?
[00:04:08.508 --> 00:04:10.149]  We still have, you know, a couple more weeks.
[00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:18.558]  And kind of piggybacking that as well, you know, we saw really the collapse of the left, the emergence of the right, you know, quote unquote, whatever you want to say.
[00:04:18.578 --> 00:04:22.562]  The emergence of the truth and death of the lie in some cases.
[00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:23.503]  That's what we're calling it.
[00:04:23.603 --> 00:04:29.590]  And part of this, you know, the election of Donald Trump here in America is kind of a reflection of Brexit.
[00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.671]  Yes, kind of like the Nationalist Uprising.
[00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:36.192]  People are sick of the so-called powers that be.
[00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:38.132]  They should be called the powers that have been.
[00:04:38.892 --> 00:04:40.853]  People are saying, we don't like the way you're doing things.
[00:04:40.873 --> 00:04:45.974]  You're destroying our countries with your ridiculous laws and they're over it.
[00:04:46.254 --> 00:04:49.115]  And so yes, we saw Brexit and then here with the election of Donald Trump.
[00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:49.695]  Incredible.
[00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:55.657]  What we're really seeing is a populist movement, a global populist movement, and the globalists cannot stand it.
[00:04:56.497 --> 00:04:57.638]  Soros actually said this.
[00:04:57.678 --> 00:05:00.899]  He said Donald Trump is attacking the new world order.
[00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:02.620]  Well, duh, buddy!
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.480]  You think?
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.241]  We're seeing this wave of Italy, France, the UK.
[00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:11.503]  Hopefully it hits Germany soon before they're totally decimated, but this was a wave.
[00:05:11.543 --> 00:05:12.323]  It was a shock wave.
[00:05:12.623 --> 00:05:15.526]  So those are those are three of the highlights, if you will.
[00:05:15.646 --> 00:05:19.309]  Trump wins, Brexit successful, the rise of populism and nationalism.
[00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:20.790]  But there were some lows this year as well.
[00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.634]  How about the death and the sketchy death of Justice Scalia?
[00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:26.755]  Absolutely.
[00:05:26.775 --> 00:05:27.916]  That was a huge story.
[00:05:27.956 --> 00:05:31.619]  And of course, his death is going to have a huge impact on the future here.
[00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:41.247]  That's one of the big things with electing Donald Trump was the fact that we are going to it's going to be really important who replaces Justice Scalia and others as well.
[00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:45.373]  There were some suspicious activities surrounding his death, that's for sure.
[00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:46.414]  But we do have a vacant seat.
[00:05:46.675 --> 00:05:47.756]  Guys, it could be so much worse.
[00:05:47.816 --> 00:05:52.842]  We could be seeing somebody else appointed that represents a globalist agenda, and we haven't.
[00:05:52.882 --> 00:05:54.344]  That seat is still very much vacant.
[00:05:54.744 --> 00:05:59.490]  You know, the Senate able to effectively block any nomination, no confirmation process happening.
[00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.651]  And it's not all bad.
[00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:06.292]  I mean, yes, we lost a great man, with some shoddy circumstances, frankly.
[00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:07.232]  This could be a lot worse.
[00:06:07.252 --> 00:06:09.493]  Yes, the speaker at a Bohemian Grove meeting.
[00:06:09.553 --> 00:06:11.894]  That's true, and maybe not a great man.
[00:06:11.934 --> 00:06:14.555]  A man who made some right decisions some of the time.
[00:06:14.635 --> 00:06:18.656]  Constitutionally minded, which is exactly what you need there at the Supreme Court.
[00:06:19.141 --> 00:06:21.565]  Look at some of the develops in Syria we saw this year.
[00:06:21.665 --> 00:06:33.644]  First you had Barack Obama supporting the moderate rebels, or ISIS, sending them weapons and money, but now we're seeing the liberation of Aleppo and re-emergence of the Syrian army.
[00:06:34.685 --> 00:07:01.519]  And with that, just the fact that we had Donald Trump calling out Obama and Hillary Clinton, calling them the founders of ISIS, just like you said, it's the emergence of truth, death to the lies, that was so incredible because, you know, Obama a couple years ago, he had that red line in Syria, he wanted to go to war and the American people said no, but then of course he set up his proxy army anyway, arming these moderate rebels who defected to ISIS, thereby making him the founder of ISIS.
[00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:02.500]  Red line!
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.781]  Really?
[00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:04.882]  I mean, come on.
[00:07:04.962 --> 00:07:06.403]  Who are we kidding here?
[00:07:06.503 --> 00:07:07.264]  Is that a joke?
[00:07:07.564 --> 00:07:10.087]  Thank God we are not at war right now again.
[00:07:10.127 --> 00:07:15.052]  You know, we're engaged in seven conflicts around the world currently, and this could be so much worse.
[00:07:15.112 --> 00:07:17.755]  I know we've seen the spillage of a refugee crisis happening.
[00:07:18.115 --> 00:07:25.963]  We've seen a lot of negative things, but this could have been so much worse had we officially invaded and toppled Assad like Obama wanted to do.
[00:07:26.772 --> 00:07:32.442]  And what we've seen coming out of what's happening in Aleppo and Syria is fake news.
[00:07:32.502 --> 00:07:34.225]  Something they like to pin on us.
[00:07:34.305 --> 00:07:39.093]  Well, we know who the real fake news is, but the emergence of the fake news narrative.
[00:07:39.764 --> 00:07:42.585]  Of course, and how amazing was that?
[00:07:42.665 --> 00:07:45.986]  That the people were not falling for that fake news narrative.
[00:07:46.006 --> 00:07:49.487]  They said, oh, it's the fake news that took over and caused Hillary Clinton the election.
[00:07:49.807 --> 00:07:53.689]  No, it's because the truth, news, is that nobody likes Hillary Clinton.
[00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:56.269]  She's an evil, wicked woman, and she was exposed.
[00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:03.772]  Now whether you want to believe it was Russia or a DNC staffer who was upset about the fact that the DNC rigged the election against Bernie Sanders,
[00:08:04.372 --> 00:08:06.053]  Either way, the truth was revealed.
[00:08:06.073 --> 00:08:11.255]  The most transparent administration ever got, you know, taken a task on that.
[00:08:11.835 --> 00:08:16.137]  And I mean, just really incredible that the people turned that around and they said, no, you know what?
[00:08:16.557 --> 00:08:19.699]  You're fake news, mainstream media, and we're sick of your lies.
[00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:20.999]  We're sick of your propaganda.
[00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:29.743]  And then, of course, you know, that in turn, now they've got these new bills where they're going to be countering propaganda with their own hashtag fake news.
[00:08:30.003 --> 00:08:38.766]  You know, I really am astounded at the role that Breitbart, Drudge, and Infowars played, not only in this election, but in piercing the darkness when it comes to these lies.
[00:08:38.946 --> 00:08:41.967]  And this was a lot of work, y'all, if I can say that.
[00:08:42.007 --> 00:08:53.231]  This was a lot of work in the past three months alone, you know, just making sure that this dark enemy didn't come to more power, that they were defeated, that they were metaphorically hit in the head.
[00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:54.552]  Goliath actually took a hit.
[00:08:55.252 --> 00:08:59.634]  And it was an honor being at the forefront of that and getting up every day and doing this and doing this.
[00:09:00.034 --> 00:09:02.195]  You know, we are sometimes a little tired.
[00:09:02.255 --> 00:09:09.439]  We might be a little tired at the end of each week, but honestly, it was an honor to be called fake news by the real purveyors of fake news.
[00:09:09.539 --> 00:09:10.019]  It's an honor.
[00:09:10.239 --> 00:09:17.508]  Yes, and I actually spoke with Alex Jones, who everyone knows has just been at the forefront of the info war for 20 plus years.
[00:09:18.189 --> 00:09:28.782]  Even he was so shocked and so surprised at the impact that info wars and Alex Jones, the dark heart, had on this election that he would actually be that close to the next president.
[00:09:29.142 --> 00:09:40.070]  But let's also not forget about the impact of WikiLeaks and Project Veritas, helping expose some of the inner workings of these Democrats and, you know, establishment government types.
[00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:42.072]  And the citizen journalists.
[00:09:42.492 --> 00:09:54.962]  There are thousands of citizen journalists, excuse me for interrupting, there are thousands of them that are up on YouTube that are perpetuating the truth, that have the nerve to go on Facebook and question and question, and they're on the ground, they're a grassroots army.
[00:09:55.522 --> 00:10:09.773]  On the ground, aside from major news sources like InfoWars, like Alex, there's an army of people that believe it and disseminate it and they're the real victors, if you will, of the spoils because we're seeing this work pay off.
[00:10:10.433 --> 00:10:11.634]  Like we never have before.
[00:10:11.974 --> 00:10:18.097]  And I would love to see just the army of people that were these paid protesters that were going in that Project Veritas exposed.
[00:10:18.477 --> 00:10:25.361]  I would like to see them come out and speak out now and kind of get on the right side of history here and say, you know what, we were paid.
[00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:27.642]  This was something we were told to do.
[00:10:28.263 --> 00:10:32.245]  And, you know, we're sick of it because we were used and frankly, it didn't work anyway.
[00:10:33.598 --> 00:10:40.407]  Now let's talk about one of the issues that kind of came into the forefront in 2015 but became a very talked about issue.
[00:10:40.447 --> 00:10:41.268]  That's immigration.
[00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:47.476]  Now for some people it was more immigration and then for other people's it was less immigration or more lawful immigration.
[00:10:47.596 --> 00:10:48.477]  This was a big issue in 2016.
[00:10:49.418 --> 00:10:51.439]  Well, for President Obama, it didn't even exist.
[00:10:51.499 --> 00:10:53.299]  He didn't even bother going to the border.
[00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:54.259]  Donald Trump did.
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:12.004]  And that was where he, of course, his words got taken out of context, because he was just visiting the border, visiting with the Border Patrol agents, seeing the massive flux of unaccompanied minors and illegal immigrants and gang members and people with diseases being held at the border.
[00:11:12.584 --> 00:11:14.165]  And he was like, look, this is insane.
[00:11:14.185 --> 00:11:15.165]  We've got to do something about it.
[00:11:15.325 --> 00:11:17.626]  And they get more funding than the VA.
[00:11:18.146 --> 00:11:18.386]  Right.
[00:11:18.746 --> 00:11:20.207]  Did you guys see the story that's up today?
[00:11:20.247 --> 00:11:23.328]  It's a caveat to this immigration story where it was on the Daily Caller.
[00:11:23.508 --> 00:11:26.609]  This guy was accused of raping a 13-year-old girl on a bus.
[00:11:26.969 --> 00:11:30.010]  He'd been deported a dozen times over.
[00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.451]  We clearly have a system that's broken.
[00:11:32.471 --> 00:11:37.812]  One of the reasons Trump won, he was not afraid to call out this issue and say, look, we've got a serious problem on our hands.
[00:11:38.213 --> 00:11:41.334]  And it's everyday Americans that are feeling the burden of this problem.
[00:11:41.394 --> 00:11:42.474]  It's not the media elites.
[00:11:42.874 --> 00:11:49.519]  It's not the administration, it's not the president, it's everyday American people that feel the brunt of this issue in our own towns.
[00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:52.942]  It's our kids that are facing these issues, not theirs!
[00:11:54.583 --> 00:12:03.810]  Seeing that of course, you know, globally the impact that illegal immigration slash refugees have had, whether they're going in and taking advantage of the welfare state of these countries.
[00:12:03.871 --> 00:12:06.072]  And I think that's the final say is that, you know,
[00:12:07.213 --> 00:12:15.859]  Whatever these dollars that are allocated to these non-citizens coming in, we'd like to see that go towards Americans that are struggling, especially our veterans.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.243]  Obviously, this is sad, but we had massive terror attacks in 2016.
[00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:31.609]  You had the Brussels subway attack, the Nice, France attack, the Christmas market in Germany, the Pulse nightclub, San Bernardino, Ohio State, New York, Minnesota.
[00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:33.430]  Terrorist attacks were on the rise in 2016.
[00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:34.711]  Right.
[00:12:34.791 --> 00:12:44.314]  And unfortunately, you know, just with the way that things are going, the way that President Obama kind of ramped up the amount of refugees that the United States accepted.
[00:12:44.334 --> 00:12:48.115]  I just don't think that we're going to see an end to that.
[00:12:48.655 --> 00:12:51.416]  However, I hope that we have some better news going into 2017.
[00:12:52.016 --> 00:12:55.957]  But yeah, it was a really tragic year globally in that respect.
[00:12:56.616 --> 00:13:01.259]  Weren't you guys amazed at the fact that major news outlets weren't even covering it accurately?
[00:13:01.299 --> 00:13:03.701]  It was a truck that was killing, doing the killing.
[00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:04.622]  It was a gun.
[00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:07.624]  It was never a radical extremist ever.
[00:13:07.684 --> 00:13:08.304]  It was Trump.
[00:13:08.684 --> 00:13:09.625]  It was a Trump hater.
[00:13:09.645 --> 00:13:11.346]  You name it, they spun it.
[00:13:11.386 --> 00:13:14.468]  But people really saw through it, and people understand the heart of the issue.
[00:13:14.488 --> 00:13:17.270]  And unfortunately, we had to report on it.
[00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.572]  I hated reporting those stories, honestly.
[00:13:19.592 --> 00:13:23.975]  They weren't favorites by any means, but hopefully we helped people understand the issue.
[00:13:24.355 --> 00:13:34.024]  And I guess that's a good thing in 2016, is that Donald Trump actually forced the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton to say the words, radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:13:34.084 --> 00:13:35.085]  So that was a big win.
[00:13:35.405 --> 00:13:40.190]  Speaking of the Obama administration, remember, Obama said he's never heard of a rigged election.
[00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.972]  Now he's saying the election was hacked.
[00:13:42.012 --> 00:13:43.693]  Of course, the election wasn't hacked.
[00:13:44.554 --> 00:13:52.900]  You know, this whole Obama-Russian narrative has picked up so much of momentum here in the last month, just completely ridiculous.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:14:02.747]  I mean, this is a story I think that's going to move on to 2017, but obviously got its roots in 2016 and is something people are going to remember how they tried to start World War III with Russia.
[00:14:03.127 --> 00:14:04.108]  They're still trying!
[00:14:04.649 --> 00:14:08.212]  Yeah, we still don't know exactly what's going to play out with this.
[00:14:08.252 --> 00:14:26.469]  When I spoke with Paul Craig Roberts, and I agree, and it was interesting to hear someone like that, such an insider, say that he feels, his gut instinct is that they are really preparing the public to accept some sort of a huge attack, possibly a false flag, I'm paraphrasing there.
[00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:33.457]  Something big that they could make happen and we will be programmed to accept that the Russians did it.
[00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:34.078]  Of course they did it.
[00:14:34.098 --> 00:14:35.099]  They've hacked in.
[00:14:35.119 --> 00:14:37.222]  Just accept it.
[00:14:37.242 --> 00:14:39.004]  That's something we've got to watch out for.
[00:14:39.024 --> 00:14:42.288]  They're setting us up for something is what you're saying and that's a fear of mine too.
[00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:44.770]  But look, the Russians, they understand.
[00:14:44.791 --> 00:14:45.231]  They see through it.
[00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:47.193]  They're waiting for Trump in office just like we are.
[00:14:47.213 --> 00:14:51.318]  And the good news is that this nightmare is coming to an end in two and a half weeks.
[00:14:51.398 --> 00:14:53.420]  I mean, there is light at the end of this tunnel.
[00:14:53.801 --> 00:14:55.663]  God forbid we see a false flag.
[00:14:55.723 --> 00:14:59.247]  We see them try to start a war between now and then.
[00:14:59.347 --> 00:15:00.248]  God forbid.
[00:15:00.308 --> 00:15:01.770]  But I mean, honestly,
[00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.112]  Putin's statement today, they're not pulling U.S.
[00:15:04.633 --> 00:15:09.277]  diplomats out of Russia, they're not retaliating, they're hanging tight.
[00:15:09.337 --> 00:15:13.882]  And Trump tipped his hat saying, thank you for being patient, we're going to get this fixed.
[00:15:14.542 --> 00:15:24.212]  We also saw the re-emergence of the Black Lives Matter group and the Black Lives Matter protests, which then correlated to a record number of cop ambushes in this country.
[00:15:25.393 --> 00:15:38.999]  Right, and I'm curious, you know, was that re-emergence due to the fact that they got hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars of funding from George Soros and these other, these other groups that are helping to prop up these organizations, bust them in.
[00:15:39.019 --> 00:15:40.500]  And Obama, don't forget about Obama.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.561]  And for whatever reason, they always choose the incidents that
[00:16:07.357 --> 00:16:12.641]  The person who wound up, unfortunately, deceased in the incident is typically in the wrong.
[00:16:12.821 --> 00:16:14.402]  I don't want to see these citizens die.
[00:16:14.422 --> 00:16:15.003]  I'm not saying I support that.
[00:16:15.023 --> 00:16:19.866]  Apart from the Freddie Gray case, which even in that case there was illegal activity, there wasn't a weapon.
[00:16:19.886 --> 00:16:33.196]  There's always the circumstantial evidence gets lost in the sauce and the mainstream media, not to borrow from Lena, but the gaslighting that takes place with these stories is just crazy and arguably the media has had a hand
[00:16:33.636 --> 00:16:37.701]  And inciting this violence that's ultimately led to blue lives dying.
[00:16:37.741 --> 00:16:39.142]  I'm sorry, but that's just the way that it is.
[00:16:39.403 --> 00:16:39.983]  Absolutely.
[00:16:40.064 --> 00:16:47.472]  And the thing is, it's like with these particular stories that they pick, the reason why is because not everyone is going to get behind it because they're like, well, they're criminals.
[00:16:47.652 --> 00:16:51.476]  So then the people that are part of these protests think nobody cares about them.
[00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:53.719]  So it's just all to get us fighting amongst each other.
[00:16:53.939 --> 00:16:59.302]  There have been some physical activities as far as, you know, perhaps war games going on.
[00:16:59.803 --> 00:17:03.665]  Egypt Air Flight 804 gets brought down and multiple Russian diplomats killed.
[00:17:04.332 --> 00:17:04.552]  Right.
[00:17:04.692 --> 00:17:04.972]  Wow.
[00:17:05.032 --> 00:17:07.613]  And that was, I mean, that right there was incredible.
[00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:11.394]  And also, too, just kind of a message to the elites thinking that they're going to be protected.
[00:17:11.854 --> 00:17:14.355]  But then it's people on their own detail, of course.
[00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:15.036]  That's right.
[00:17:15.056 --> 00:17:16.436]  There are a lot of shady circumstances.
[00:17:16.476 --> 00:17:19.297]  I'm so afraid we're going to miss the best story of 2017.
[00:17:20.017 --> 00:17:24.899]  For me, all of the celebrities that swore they were leaving the country, we're going to get some relief.
[00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:30.921]  Not to jump the gun here, because I know you have a minute and 30 seconds left, but we have to talk about, bye-bye, Lena Dunham.
[00:17:31.741 --> 00:17:32.061]  I don't know.
[00:17:52.975 --> 00:17:53.215]  Kind of.
[00:17:53.696 --> 00:17:55.037]  The elites have been put on notice.
[00:17:55.057 --> 00:17:55.397]  2016, man.
[00:17:55.638 --> 00:17:57.659]  The elites have been put on notice.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:07.669]  And it's interesting, just sitting here talking about this, to go back for a second, I'm curious, do you, I'm wondering if the globalists were actually also using ISIS to try to poke the bear, too.
[00:18:07.769 --> 00:18:12.113]  And with Flight 804, the killing of the ambassador, it's just something that, you know, we're trying to think about.
[00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:13.114]  Well, they control them.
[00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:14.335]  Alright, so here's my finals.
[00:18:14.355 --> 00:18:17.617]  I'm going to run down my finalists and then you guys go through the things that I forgot to mention.
[00:18:18.158 --> 00:18:29.946]  The Oregon Wildlife Standoff, the North Dakota Pipeline Standoff, the Iran hostage deal, all that cash, Michigan water crisis, the Zika virus, the bathrooms, Transitor Bathrooms was a big thing.
[00:18:30.126 --> 00:18:31.908]  How about the house sit-ins for gun control?
[00:18:31.928 --> 00:18:33.749]  I've never seen anything like that craziness.
[00:18:33.809 --> 00:18:39.613]  Self-driving cars, Venezuela collapsing, the flooding in Louisiana, no show from Obama.
[00:18:39.753 --> 00:18:41.655]  You forgot to mention Harambe here.
[00:18:42.315 --> 00:18:43.076]  Harambe.
[00:18:43.116 --> 00:18:44.417]  Of course Harambe was a big story.
[00:18:44.437 --> 00:18:45.317]  Anything else that I missed?
[00:18:45.357 --> 00:18:46.959]  Iran getting $10 billion in cash and gold.
[00:18:47.139 --> 00:18:48.300]  There you go.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:48.960]  So there you go.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.661]  Top stories from 2016.
[00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:51.822]  We'll see you in 2017 all year long.
[00:18:51.842 --> 00:18:52.283]  Three years ago.
[00:19:03.752 --> 00:19:16.407]  The Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act repealed the law that had been on the books for decades, barring the CIA and other agencies from engaging in domestic propaganda and disinformation.
[00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:36.355]  Over the weekend, they passed the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act that funds 160 plus million dollars to this new organization that will, quote, discover and counter with its own disinformation, alternative media that they dub fake news.
[00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:52.010]  At the very same time, we see mainstream media claiming that Trump, myself, Tucker Carlson, you name it, are Russian agents, and that the American people really wanted Hillary Clinton, but the Russians somehow hacked in, and that's why Trump won.
[00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:56.173]  Yes, we've gotten Trump elected, but they're openly trying to overthrow that.
[00:19:57.034 --> 00:20:00.379]  Now more than ever, InfoWars needs your prayers and your support.

[00:23:03.333 --> 00:23:11.176]  An army of idiots is convinced that 2016 is the worst year ever because Trump won and some celebrities died.
[00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:12.217]  David Bowie left us.
[00:23:12.337 --> 00:23:13.237]  George Michael left us.
[00:23:13.357 --> 00:23:14.257]  Carrie Fisher left us.
[00:23:14.378 --> 00:23:14.998]  Prince left us.
[00:23:15.258 --> 00:23:17.239]  We elected Donald f***ing Trump!
[00:23:17.259 --> 00:23:19.780]  2016, worst year ever.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.001]  2016, worst year ever.
[00:23:22.221 --> 00:23:23.621]  Don't take Carrie Fisher away from us, please.
[00:23:23.701 --> 00:23:24.782]  Take Trump instead.
[00:23:24.902 --> 00:23:30.884]  So, with all these celebrity deaths and a Cheeto puff becoming president, people are considering 2016 to be the worst year ever.
[00:23:31.264 --> 00:23:35.167]  I don't know if this is the worst year ever for celeb deaths, but it sure feels like it.
[00:23:35.468 --> 00:23:37.930]  F*** you 2016, good riddance!
[00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:42.173]  It's official, 2016 has been the worst year ever and the highest year for celebrity deaths.
[00:23:42.193 --> 00:23:44.975]  2017 better get here soon or I'm out.
[00:23:44.995 --> 00:23:46.957]  Hashtag 2016 sucks!
[00:23:46.977 --> 00:23:47.958]  2017 is only a few days away.
[00:23:48.138 --> 00:23:52.081]  Thank God we can finally say goodbye to the worst year ever!
[00:23:54.983 --> 00:24:08.450]  Right, so because some random actors and musicians that you never met, knew, or really cared about before they died, died, and because some political outcomes didn't go your way, that makes 2016 the worst year ever!
[00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:09.491]  Get a grip.
[00:24:09.991 --> 00:24:17.315]  The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic killed 50 to 100 million people, 5% of the world's population.
[00:24:17.415 --> 00:24:21.517]  Yeah, that probably affected more people than Carrie Fisher passing away.
[00:24:21.597 --> 00:24:28.219]  The Soviet famine of 32-33 killed so many millions of people we don't even know the actual number.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.701]  But the alleged drug addict George Michael dies, and it's a global tragedy.
[00:24:32.801 --> 00:24:34.682]  Get some frigging perspective.
[00:24:34.862 --> 00:24:41.305]  On one day alone, in 1916, nearly 20,000 British soldiers were killed at the Battle of the Somme.
[00:24:42.945 --> 00:24:44.786]  That was an actual tragedy.
[00:24:44.846 --> 00:24:49.467]  Yes, it's sad for George Michael and Carrie Fisher's family that they died prematurely.
[00:24:49.547 --> 00:24:52.087]  But how does it affect you in any way?
[00:24:52.227 --> 00:24:59.049]  Most of the idiot millennials crying over this weren't even born when George Michael and Carrie Fisher were in their heyday.
[00:24:59.129 --> 00:25:03.670]  You've been manipulated by celebrity-obsessed culture to take it personally.
[00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:08.711]  The other reason is that we've allowed society and culture to become completely atomized.
[00:25:08.891 --> 00:25:16.973]  Celebrities of the 20th century were universally known and loved because being a celebrity was something that had to be earned.
[00:25:17.113 --> 00:25:22.395]  You might not believe this, but celebrities used to actually have talent to become famous.
[00:25:22.535 --> 00:25:25.756]  Now, fame is determined by who can be the most vulgar.
[00:25:25.896 --> 00:25:33.859]  Who can sell out quickly enough to become the poster child for the next generation of nihilistic, mindless, cultural parasites?
[00:25:34.039 --> 00:25:41.161]  The result is that there are more celebrities than ever before with less some talent than ever before.
[00:25:41.241 --> 00:25:44.862]  So you're not really mourning the deaths of Prince and George Michael.
[00:25:44.902 --> 00:25:47.323]  You're mourning the death of your culture.
[00:25:47.583 --> 00:25:49.385]  The death of authenticity.
[00:25:49.445 --> 00:25:54.369]  Will anyone mourn the deaths of these idiots in 50 years time?
[00:25:54.429 --> 00:25:59.553]  But who's largely to blame for this 2016 is the worst year ever narrative?
[00:25:59.613 --> 00:26:04.837]  You guessed it, the cancerous polyp on the butt of humanity known as BuzzFeed.
[00:26:05.137 --> 00:26:08.763]  24 tweets that perfectly sum up how sh**ty 2016 has been so far.
[00:26:08.903 --> 00:26:09.625]  It wasn't just you.
[00:26:09.805 --> 00:26:11.788]  Chipotle also had a terrible year.
[00:26:11.808 --> 00:26:13.491]  2016 was quite a year.
[00:26:13.671 --> 00:26:15.254]  These are the gifts that got us through it.
[00:26:15.334 --> 00:26:16.416]  Guys, it's official.
[00:26:16.436 --> 00:26:17.157]  2016 is actually the worst year.
[00:26:21.175 --> 00:26:28.718]  No BuzzFeed, Trump's election and Princess Leia dying doesn't compete with global catastrophes, genocide and plague.
[00:26:28.939 --> 00:26:38.043]  Maybe if you've been living in Aleppo in the middle of a civil war for the past 12 months you could justifiably claim that 2016 was the worst year ever.
[00:26:38.143 --> 00:26:44.946]  Sitting in your comfy air-conditioned home on your iPad reading a BuzzFeed listicle while tutting about Donald Trump
[00:26:45.606 --> 00:26:46.447]  I don't think so.
[00:26:46.607 --> 00:27:01.723]  Oh yeah, and I would argue that when it comes to ranking the absolute worst people of 2016, the Orlando nightclub mass-murdering terrorist Omar Mateen is somewhat more worthy of that title than people who you disagree with on the internet.
[00:27:01.824 --> 00:27:07.670]  The fact is that too many people care more about celebrities than their own family members.
[00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:13.715]  How many of you were more upset over Prince and David Bowie dying than your own grandmother dying?
[00:27:13.815 --> 00:27:18.279]  We've been completely disconnected from the people in our immediate life.
[00:27:18.639 --> 00:27:20.941]  The ones who should matter most.
[00:27:21.381 --> 00:27:23.063]  We've been atomized.
[00:27:23.283 --> 00:27:24.104]  No, d**khead.
[00:27:24.304 --> 00:27:26.707]  It's the worst year ever because Trump won.
[00:27:26.787 --> 00:27:38.020]  Right, so 100 plus families in Nice and Berlin had their loved ones crushed to death by crazed jihadists driving trucks and you're still whining about Trump.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.000]  Your team didn't win an election.
[00:27:40.301 --> 00:27:41.181]  Get over it!
[00:27:41.341 --> 00:27:45.922]  You're still whining about your parents getting you the wrong coloured iPhone for Christmas.
[00:27:46.162 --> 00:27:47.842]  Show some gratitude.
[00:27:47.922 --> 00:27:51.063]  Your living standard is the highest in human history.
[00:27:51.323 --> 00:27:52.884]  You've never had it better.
[00:27:52.964 --> 00:27:55.644]  And what about all the good stuff that happened in 2016?
[00:27:56.204 --> 00:27:59.085]  We made massive strides in curing Alzheimer's and cancer.
[00:27:59.305 --> 00:28:01.226]  Global crime figures continue to come down.
[00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:03.646]  Child mortality rates continue to come down.
[00:28:03.946 --> 00:28:05.347]  Tiger numbers are recovering.
[00:28:05.607 --> 00:28:07.007]  Panda numbers are recovering.
[00:28:11.001 --> 00:28:15.865]  Compared to our ancestors, life in 2016 was pretty damn good.
[00:28:15.965 --> 00:28:22.229]  So stop trying to out-virtue signal each other on social media about how depressed you are over 2016.
[00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.172]  Stop whining about Donald Trump and dead celebrities.
[00:28:26.392 --> 00:28:35.599]  Start living your life with authenticity, reconnecting with the people around you, and making them the center of your universe.
[00:28:41.047 --> 00:28:44.688]  We have a rather ambivalent attitude to science at present.
[00:28:49.050 --> 00:29:02.894]  We have come to expect a steady increase in the standard of living that science and technology have brought, but people distrust science because they don't understand it or feel they can control it.
[00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:15.267]  The popularity of science fiction like Star Trek is because this is a form of science with which people feel safe.
[00:29:19.028 --> 00:29:24.090]  But an understanding of science fact would lay their fears to rest much better.
[00:29:27.111 --> 00:29:34.853]  Stephen Hawking, one of the smartest men on the planet, has predicted that we will die out within a thousand years if we do not colonize new worlds and planets.
[00:29:35.717 --> 00:29:41.220]  However, with a prediction this severe, the government still refuses to act with more funding to our space program.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:50.644]  Instead of funding vital space programs, Obama has spent millions, billions and even trillions on frivolous purchases that will never benefit us as a country.
[00:29:51.345 --> 00:29:52.746]  He spent over $2 million.
[00:29:53.906 --> 00:29:58.030]  On a study which concluded that children do not like food that has been sneezed on.
[00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.031]  These people are true geniuses by the way.
[00:30:00.352 --> 00:30:04.555]  He also spent over half a million on a medieval smells exhibit.
[00:30:04.876 --> 00:30:06.717]  Just, you can't make this stuff up people.
[00:30:07.158 --> 00:30:14.164]  He spent over trillion dollars on the failed F-35 military aircraft program.
[00:30:14.564 --> 00:30:17.967]  Which still proves to be a waste and we've never been flown one of these things.
[00:30:18.387 --> 00:30:21.230]  We need to be redirecting money into the space program.
[00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:23.935]  But our modern government says no.
[00:30:25.435 --> 00:30:29.197]  We continue to waste money, while we could be saving lives in the future.
[00:30:29.597 --> 00:30:35.160]  Back when my grandpappy was a boy, he had role models such as Buzz Aldrin and Chuck Yeager to look up to.
[00:30:36.112 --> 00:30:41.555]  Nowadays we have Kim Kardashian and Amy Schumer, people who teach us nothing and just make us waste our time.
[00:30:41.936 --> 00:30:49.560]  Things indeed look dark, for we have traded our adventurous spirit and lifestyle for Snapchat and Diet Coke.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.081]  There is some good news though.
[00:30:51.462 --> 00:30:56.565]  Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk has lately been inspiring thousands
[00:30:57.185 --> 00:30:57.606]  We're good to go.
[00:31:14.329 --> 00:31:15.710]  They're not even funded by the government.
[00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.191]  They don't even get that much money.
[00:31:17.571 --> 00:31:19.193]  But they still do a better job than NASA.
[00:31:19.773 --> 00:31:20.594]  And you want to know why?
[00:31:20.614 --> 00:31:21.874]  It's because of ingenuity.
[00:31:22.335 --> 00:31:24.937]  These people are united, and they want to make a difference.
[00:31:25.137 --> 00:31:26.218]  They want us to explore.
[00:31:26.378 --> 00:31:27.458]  They want us to get off the planet.
[00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:28.559]  They want us to survive.
[00:31:28.579 --> 00:31:31.441]  We need to adopt that mindset for ourselves.
[00:31:31.942 --> 00:31:33.022]  Imagine what we can do!
[00:31:33.843 --> 00:31:37.884]  With this man, who is now President Trump's advisor in the future.
[00:31:38.224 --> 00:31:44.086]  But to fully utilize the resources that we have available, we have to change as a culture, as a mindset.
[00:31:44.526 --> 00:31:51.688]  We have to say that we want to explore, that we want to get out there, that we just don't want to sit on our iPhones on the couch anymore getting fatter and fatter and drinking more Slurpees.
[00:31:52.788 --> 00:31:56.529]  You have to choose, you have to make the conscious decision to change.
[00:31:57.709 --> 00:31:59.370]  And to follow where our forefathers did.
[00:32:00.407 --> 00:32:01.288]  To the next frontier.
[00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:03.572]  And space is the final frontier.
[00:32:04.013 --> 00:32:06.276]  This is Rex Jones reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:32:10.706 --> 00:32:20.274]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:32:20.734 --> 00:32:22.455]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:32:22.635 --> 00:32:23.196]  Think about it.
[00:32:23.396 --> 00:32:29.181]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interest.
[00:32:29.441 --> 00:32:35.045]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:32:35.405 --> 00:32:39.649]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources,
[00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:47.152]  Or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:32:47.412 --> 00:32:50.193]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:32:50.373 --> 00:32:52.854]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:32:53.174 --> 00:32:57.616]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:32:58.056 --> 00:32:58.636]  Think about it.
[00:33:02.486 --> 00:33:07.269]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[00:33:07.429 --> 00:33:14.474]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[00:33:14.734 --> 00:33:23.220]  I started to exercise really hard again, and I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:34.051]  But when I started working with Dr. Grip and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[00:33:34.292 --> 00:33:34.632]  Boom!
[00:33:34.972 --> 00:33:38.416]  Weight started pouring off, toxins started coming out of my body.
[00:33:38.897 --> 00:33:40.038]  Then, by early 2016,
[00:33:42.091 --> 00:33:45.312]  I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my twenties.
[00:33:45.432 --> 00:33:46.532]  But the election heated up.
[00:33:46.572 --> 00:33:48.953]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[00:33:49.073 --> 00:33:58.315]  But more importantly, I stopped taking the supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[00:33:58.535 --> 00:33:59.495]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[00:33:59.675 --> 00:34:03.356]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[00:34:04.156 --> 00:34:06.277]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again.
[00:34:07.018 --> 00:34:10.239]  And I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[00:34:10.279 --> 00:34:11.620]  It's a holiday, so I'll probably eat more.
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:15.262]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[00:34:15.482 --> 00:34:16.403]  It's December 5th, 2016.
[00:34:16.523 --> 00:34:20.365]  We're only like 25 days from 2017.
[00:34:21.086 --> 00:34:30.691]  And I want to invite all of the InfoWarriors of every race, color, and creed that bleed red blood and love liberty, justice, and truth to make our bodies great again.
[00:34:33.564 --> 00:34:38.567]  One of the most common questions I get is, you've changed the whole radio TV model.
[00:34:39.348 --> 00:34:40.088]  How did you do it?
[00:34:40.148 --> 00:34:43.030]  Did an ad agency teach you that or what book did you read?
[00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:44.892]  And the answer is, it was trial and error.
[00:34:45.172 --> 00:34:50.475]  I promote products that I personally use, like the Nutraceuticals and Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:52.797]  And it's the same thing for this promotion.
[00:34:53.277 --> 00:34:54.598]  I didn't get this from an ad agency.
[00:34:54.658 --> 00:34:55.839]  I didn't just think this up.
[00:34:56.339 --> 00:35:03.204]  I was sitting there, I'd gained probably 10, 15 pounds because I'd gotten out of the habit of taking the supplements in the last few months with the election.
[00:35:03.964 --> 00:35:14.028]  And I was thinking, wow, I need to religiously take these, because I'm promoting these things, it's making me healthier, and if I'm not taking them, you know, I'm fatter, plus people aren't going to buy the product.
[00:35:14.509 --> 00:35:17.670]  So that's where the promotion comes from, is purely from reality.
[00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:24.853]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[00:35:25.173 --> 00:35:27.314]  I've lost five pounds.
[00:35:27.714 --> 00:35:28.475]  We're good to go.
[00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:51.598]  I mean, quite frankly, I eat more junk during the holidays like everybody else.
[00:35:52.018 --> 00:35:53.279]  So I'm eating worse.
[00:35:53.919 --> 00:36:01.283]  But because I've got these trace elements, or whatever it's doing in DNA Force and X2 and Supermail, I have lost 5 pounds.
[00:36:01.443 --> 00:36:01.984]  It's incredible.
[00:36:02.984 --> 00:36:04.905]  I thought I might lose 10 to 15 in a month.
[00:36:05.126 --> 00:36:06.406]  If this continues, it'll be 20.
[00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:08.928]  But generally, it's more dramatic up front.
[00:36:09.528 --> 00:36:10.409]  This is an experiment.
[00:36:10.509 --> 00:36:11.269]  Everybody's watching.
[00:36:11.509 --> 00:36:12.350]  We'll see what happens.
[00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:13.650]  This is Part 2.
[00:36:14.744 --> 00:36:15.705]  Next week, part three.
[00:36:16.465 --> 00:36:17.066]  That's a good point.
[00:36:17.706 --> 00:36:23.089]  Uh, we just cut there and Rob Deuce said, uh, Hey Alex, I know you don't follow script, but you might want to add to people.
[00:36:23.369 --> 00:36:26.992]  We're running some of the biggest specials of the year until December 17th.
[00:36:27.272 --> 00:36:33.016]  That's the last day that you can get your order in and have guaranteed shipping anywhere in the United States.
[00:36:33.196 --> 00:36:38.859]  And we have some of the biggest specials of the year, 50% off many of the nutraceuticals, the lowest discounts, 25%, 30% off X2.
[00:36:41.901 --> 00:36:59.279]  Huge discounts and free shipping storewide on every product thousands of items and on top of that if you sign up for auto ship an additional 10% off and I'm gonna do one more bad thing because I'm politically correct Or I guess I'm politically incorrect and that's a Merry Christmas to everybody.
[00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:00.780]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.421]  You're awesome
[00:37:16.172 --> 00:37:17.193]  Now notice what's happened.
[00:37:19.534 --> 00:37:24.098]  Suddenly, the FBI director says, cover up your webcam, it's watching you for decades.
[00:37:24.518 --> 00:37:25.619]  I told you that 20 years ago.
[00:37:26.019 --> 00:37:34.205]  I had national television make fun of me for covering up the sticker on my computer, even though it was known that hackers, governments, you name it, were accessing it.
[00:37:35.202 --> 00:37:40.966]  Now they admit, since Snowden revelations, it's been happening for, again, over a decade, as we warned you.
[00:37:41.407 --> 00:37:48.712]  But I had whistleblowers, formerly with the NSA and major engineers for telecoms, breaking down all of this to me 20 years ago.
[00:37:49.412 --> 00:37:52.615]  I had whistleblowers like Wayne Madsen on 20 years ago, from the NSA.
[00:37:52.955 --> 00:37:54.436]  They want to control the future.
[00:37:54.997 --> 00:38:03.022]  They don't want to just predict the future with billions of people hooked into the web, telling them your hopes and dreams, and where you're going to eat, what clothes you're going to buy, and where you want to vacation.
[00:38:03.963 --> 00:38:16.060]  They now can use stimuli with deals they offer and social pressure to make you conform to what they want you to do, first by very small degrees and finally by massive degrees.
[00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:19.925]  This is the final revolution against free will and humanity.
[00:38:20.666 --> 00:38:34.762]  And it's so cold-blooded that if we just collectively wake up to whatever they say is trendy, whatever they say is cool, knowing it's a fraud and liquid death, cultural death, humanity will overthrow this tyranny, just like the globalists put all their power in to stop Brexit.
[00:38:35.583 --> 00:38:41.885]  All their power in to put Hillary in, all their power to stop Italy to vote, to start leaving the EU, and all of it's blowing up in their faces.
[00:38:42.345 --> 00:38:52.207]  Identifying them as the enemy, no matter how fancy their propaganda is, or how good their virtual reality is, will end them with free will that trumps their matrix.
[00:38:53.268 --> 00:38:53.908]  Leanne McAdoo.
[00:38:54.758 --> 00:39:10.503]  Well, Alex, you know, you kind of, when we left off with this first part of the segment, we were really getting into how Facebook is leading the charge here with creating this virtual reality and trying to convince all the dumb effers out there to freely give up their personal data.
[00:39:10.883 --> 00:39:15.944]  It's not enough that we're going to tell them what we're eating for breakfast and, you know, give up all that personal data.
[00:39:15.964 --> 00:39:24.527]  Now they actually want to strap us into this virtual reality and freely mine data from our brains, from our emotions, our behavior.
[00:39:24.667 --> 00:39:25.527]  We read from this earlier.
[00:39:25.587 --> 00:39:27.148]  This is mainstream news in their own statements.
[00:39:27.188 --> 00:39:28.209]  Go back through this, Leigh-Anne.
[00:39:28.229 --> 00:39:28.829]  This is chilling.
[00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:48.598]  Yeah, and everyone recalls Facebook a couple years ago, they did that experiment where they were, it was a massive emotional contagion through social network study where they were only on some feeds they were showing people negative stories and then on other feeds they were showing people only positive stories to see how they could nudge people into feeling a certain way.
[00:39:48.658 --> 00:39:51.660]  So on a mass scale they were secretly programming everyone.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:56.664]  Well, that leads to what they're working on now with virtual reality and the Oculus Rift headset.
[00:39:57.985 --> 00:40:05.791]  They're calling this the next major computing platform, VR, and they're very excited about the fact that everyone is going to be living inside of an avatar.
[00:40:06.092 --> 00:40:10.215]  So avatars will form the foundation of your identity in virtual reality.
[00:40:10.235 --> 00:40:16.180]  And then they can tax control rate you by that avatar score with governments and corporations in their own words.
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:16.540]  Exactly.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.703]  Notice they say, it's the newest, coolest thing, like Google Glasses.
[00:40:19.963 --> 00:40:21.024]  It's the newest, coolest thing.
[00:40:21.344 --> 00:40:22.265]  Nobody wants it.
[00:40:22.465 --> 00:40:23.586]  It makes everybody nauseous.
[00:40:23.886 --> 00:40:24.607]  It's garbage.
[00:40:24.667 --> 00:40:27.009]  But they want to control reality.
[00:40:27.029 --> 00:40:34.254]  Just like Monsanto doesn't want any seeds for grass, pecan trees, fruit trees, wheat, bananas.
[00:40:34.575 --> 00:40:36.917]  They don't want plants to be able to replicate again.
[00:40:37.677 --> 00:40:39.599]  Okay, I mean, they want total control.
[00:40:39.799 --> 00:40:42.081]  They want kids that have five parents, so they own the patent.
[00:40:42.541 --> 00:40:47.285]  People have had their blood for 45 years in the US and Europe taken and put in a secret UN database.
[00:40:47.405 --> 00:40:49.427]  I helped expose that 20 years ago.
[00:40:49.467 --> 00:40:50.408]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:40:50.808 --> 00:40:55.932]  Then when you go in to get a new genome treatment, they go, oh, sorry, your blood got bought 25 years ago.
[00:40:56.212 --> 00:40:58.054]  This company owns that gene treatment.
[00:40:58.834 --> 00:41:01.976]  Folks, this is an ultra-massive scientific takeover plan.
[00:41:02.196 --> 00:41:05.819]  But if we're aware of it and don't act like dumb animals, it's game over.
[00:41:06.019 --> 00:41:09.921]  InfoWars told you all this from their own white papers decades ago.
[00:41:10.262 --> 00:41:11.302]  Now it's here, folks.
[00:41:11.682 --> 00:41:12.343]  Better listen.
[00:41:12.643 --> 00:41:14.664]  I'm sorry to lecture people.
[00:41:14.684 --> 00:41:15.705]  This is serious crap.
[00:41:15.885 --> 00:41:16.446]  No, it's true.
[00:41:16.506 --> 00:41:17.607]  They want it all.
[00:41:17.667 --> 00:41:19.228]  And it's not just about advertising.
[00:41:19.268 --> 00:41:23.151]  I mean, that's what, of course, all of the cookies and the trackers and everything is used for now.
[00:41:23.172 --> 00:41:24.353]  No, we want your soul!
[00:41:24.373 --> 00:41:25.213]  That's not enough for them.
[00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:27.235]  They don't want to know what your habits are on the internet.
[00:41:27.275 --> 00:41:32.200]  They want to freely mine data from your bodies, your head movements, your facial expressions.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:36.904]  But they say the ultimate goal is to unlock human emotion.
[00:41:37.264 --> 00:41:46.066]  So that they can figure out how to use your online avatar to nudge you into certain behavioral programming in these virtual reality worlds.
[00:41:46.086 --> 00:41:48.846]  And then of course, you know, that's how you're going to act in the real world.
[00:41:48.866 --> 00:42:01.589]  And nudge is Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations czar, who in 2006 at Harvard and then at Chicago Business School wrote, we'll license conspiracy theories, people that question us, as fake news.
[00:42:01.809 --> 00:42:02.729]  We'll fine them.
[00:42:03.909 --> 00:42:05.510]  And then we'll put him in electronic ghettos.
[00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:06.751]  These are words he used.
[00:42:07.271 --> 00:42:08.452]  And they said, what are examples?
[00:42:08.492 --> 00:42:09.132]  His students did.
[00:42:09.172 --> 00:42:12.795]  And he said, if someone says moderate sunlight is needed to be healthy.
[00:42:14.175 --> 00:42:16.617]  And again, the sun isn't good now.
[00:42:16.657 --> 00:42:18.118]  These people want to play God.
[00:42:18.418 --> 00:42:18.938]  Look it up.
[00:42:19.699 --> 00:42:22.540]  And then now Obama last weekend signed the bill.
[00:42:23.401 --> 00:42:24.942]  So again, realize the magnitude.
[00:42:25.062 --> 00:42:29.525]  Well, this was the EPA came out with that big report last year saying sunlight is bad for plants.
[00:42:30.225 --> 00:42:30.926]  Are you kidding me?
[00:42:31.346 --> 00:42:31.626]  What?
[00:42:32.367 --> 00:42:33.148]  It's madness.
[00:42:33.208 --> 00:42:34.069]  It's total madness.
[00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:36.151]  Again, they want to feed us garbage.
[00:42:36.391 --> 00:42:37.812]  They admit this to see.
[00:42:38.293 --> 00:42:40.395]  See, now they know that we've exposed their fake news.
[00:42:40.415 --> 00:42:41.075]  They're falling apart.
[00:42:41.376 --> 00:42:47.021]  They said, fine, flood everything with even more disinfo to jam everything and just create societal disintegration.
[00:42:47.261 --> 00:42:49.683]  And then the elites don't give their kids iPads, Steve Jobs.
[00:42:50.504 --> 00:42:58.949]  The elites drink filtered water, eat only non-GMO, and stay sequestered away from it all, cold-bloodedly carrying it out on us, while totally shielding themselves.
[00:42:58.969 --> 00:42:59.770]  They all admit this.
[00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:00.150]  Right.
[00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:07.254]  And I consider myself to be a pretty awake individual, but even I have started to feel a little insane lately just with the news.
[00:43:07.294 --> 00:43:08.375]  There's so much double-C.
[00:43:08.395 --> 00:43:09.775]  Insanity is exploding.
[00:43:10.116 --> 00:43:11.476]  Mental illness is exploding.
[00:43:11.777 --> 00:43:13.538]  This is 21st century warfare.
[00:43:15.779 --> 00:43:18.482]  I mean it is the gaslighting and it is being very effective.
[00:43:18.522 --> 00:43:22.827]  So if it's having an effect on me, I can't imagine the effect it's having on the average person.
[00:43:22.947 --> 00:43:27.191]  I mean Obama talks about let's stop wars while he funds Arab Springs, wars against Israel.
[00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:35.080]  He gets the Nobel Peace Prize when he's the one that's bombing most of the countries and doesn't even keep account of the innocent people that he's killing.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:39.482]  We've all got a forest bae that calls forest therapy in Japan.
[00:43:39.522 --> 00:43:40.843]  Get out in nature, get out in the forest.
[00:43:41.163 --> 00:43:48.287]  We've all got to start unplugging more and more as therapy to come back even stronger when we have to jack into the Matrix.
[00:43:48.687 --> 00:43:49.148]  Exactly.
[00:43:49.588 --> 00:43:56.572]  And so that's what people need to understand, you know, when you go into these internet ghettos or plug into the VR, you are plugging into the Matrix.
[00:43:56.592 --> 00:44:01.915]  But at least if you can go in there with your humanity intact, then maybe you can help wake other people up.
[00:44:02.375 --> 00:44:03.255]  Let's be clear.
[00:44:03.656 --> 00:44:05.196]  Why are we doing this expanded part two?
[00:44:05.636 --> 00:44:11.339]  They've openly announced it's AI listening to you, watching you, calling the cops if you spank your kids, even though it's not illegal.
[00:44:12.119 --> 00:44:13.760]  They openly admit all this, okay?
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:19.603]  They didn't tell me 14 years ago when my son was being born, when I went to the hospital, that they had a computer asking, do you have enough money?
[00:44:20.003 --> 00:44:22.404]  When I was out of the room, they asked my wife if I was mean to her.
[00:44:22.684 --> 00:44:24.965]  And later when I found out, they said, sir, it goes in the health department.
[00:44:25.365 --> 00:44:26.666]  Back then they had human spies.
[00:44:27.086 --> 00:44:44.674]  Now it's you pay, because you get discounts with Amazon or whatever, to have a little robot listening to you, watching you, much worse than even what's on your phone, and you pay to have this in your house, tracking your life, and it's literally preying on you, and they don't even deny it now, they say, it's preying on you, you will submit.
[00:44:44.774 --> 00:44:46.515]  I showed that in the first segment.
[00:44:46.555 --> 00:44:53.298]  This is, again, breaking our will, trying to demoralize us, trying to make us feel like we're weird, that we don't want to live in Big Brother.
[00:44:54.090 --> 00:45:01.778]  Well, and also, too, the thing that's also really infuriating is that we know that the Internet of Things is going to be used by government, law enforcement, things like that.
[00:45:01.798 --> 00:45:02.399]  Already has been.
[00:45:02.419 --> 00:45:02.639]  Right.
[00:45:02.739 --> 00:45:13.490]  But it's also going to be used by your 12-year-old little Internet hacking geek who thinks it's really cool to hack into their neighbor's home and lock them out of their house, you know, do God knows what.
[00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:13.790]  I think?
[00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:55.860]  Well, and also at the same time as the President is threatening retaliation against Russia for somehow interfering with our elections, we are inviting them into our own home with this Internet of Things because hackers are ubiquitous.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:56.461]  They're all over the globe.
[00:45:56.481 --> 00:45:59.783]  That's what they've been using in the latest big giant attacks is the Internet of Things.
[00:45:59.863 --> 00:46:04.287]  You don't know how to program your security cameras, your smart refrigerator, your whatever.
[00:46:04.387 --> 00:46:07.690]  That's what they're hitting and using to bring down major systems.
[00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:20.178]  Right, and they're totally violating your civil rights, and thanks to the Digital Millennium Act, you're not allowed, if you understand the code, you're not allowed to open up your refrigerator, your washing machine, and figure out how to change the code in it, so it stops violating your civil rights.
[00:46:20.198 --> 00:46:22.219]  No, they're putting Trojan horse controls and admitting it!
[00:46:22.259 --> 00:46:23.980]  Remember, none of this is our opinion.
[00:46:24.321 --> 00:46:35.248]  Now, it's all admitted, just like I told people 20 years ago, because engineers were telling us, smart meters are the beginning of the Internet of Things, they're going to tax you by the hour, they're going to control your temp, they're going to rip you off.
[00:46:36.058 --> 00:46:37.038]  It was Enron who came up with it.
[00:46:37.278 --> 00:46:38.319]  Now they're all over the country.
[00:46:38.719 --> 00:46:43.421]  And they, by the way, interface as a wireless hub with the Internet of Things in your house.
[00:46:43.841 --> 00:46:44.041]  Right.
[00:46:44.241 --> 00:46:45.881]  And that's what their experts are asking now.
[00:46:45.981 --> 00:46:50.563]  Will 2017 be the year your home becomes under attack from cybercriminals?
[00:46:50.783 --> 00:47:01.367]  So why they want us, you know, they want us to all be so afraid of the Russia and the Chinese, but then they're also setting us up to be targets of cybercriminals anywhere with anything.
[00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:11.162]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[00:47:12.143 --> 00:47:20.964]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[00:47:21.364 --> 00:47:25.205]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[00:47:25.285 --> 00:47:28.306]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[00:47:28.726 --> 00:47:29.806]  We now have George Soros
[00:47:30.906 --> 00:47:38.128]  As a goblin, on the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[00:47:38.868 --> 00:47:43.989]  It says, deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:52.551]  So, it is a limited edition, deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[00:47:52.911 --> 00:47:53.471]  It's powerful.
[00:47:53.491 --> 00:47:54.532]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.

[00:48:59.621 --> 00:49:02.301]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:49:07.183 --> 00:49:09.083]  He's going to be the Golden Toad.
[00:49:09.463 --> 00:49:11.844]  I assume he'll mention the phone call he received.
[00:49:11.864 --> 00:49:12.224]  Get ready.
[00:49:13.224 --> 00:49:14.924]  He charges into a goblin's nest.
[00:49:14.944 --> 00:49:15.965]  This is amazing.
[00:49:16.085 --> 00:49:17.005]  As long as he doesn't...
[00:49:17.893 --> 00:49:21.677]  As long as he doesn't kiss a goblin, goblins vomit.
[00:49:21.777 --> 00:49:22.898]  Catch him in bed with a goblin.
[00:49:23.299 --> 00:49:25.581]  I don't think there's any danger of that.
[00:49:25.601 --> 00:49:26.622]  No, he defeated the goblins.
[00:49:26.743 --> 00:49:27.143]  He did it.
[00:49:33.071 --> 00:49:39.874]  I wonder what Mr. Maddow is going to be saying tomorrow.
[00:49:40.274 --> 00:49:43.475]  I'll take some more of that.
[00:49:43.535 --> 00:49:46.697]  I heard that she was a little depressed tonight.
[00:49:47.097 --> 00:49:48.197]  Oh, you heard that?
[00:49:49.498 --> 00:49:54.020]  She won't be able to make people pour and screw people over and like F blacks over anymore?
[00:49:55.201 --> 00:49:58.102]  Oh, sorry, there's big tacos coming for the communities.
[00:49:59.643 --> 00:50:00.043]  Thank you.
[00:50:01.661 --> 00:50:02.481]  Thank you very much.
[00:50:02.501 --> 00:50:05.222]  This is almost as good as Yorktown.
[00:50:05.622 --> 00:50:07.442]  It's pretty amazing.
[00:50:07.923 --> 00:50:09.203]  Could you believe this is happening?
[00:50:10.243 --> 00:50:11.563]  Why do I have a bad feeling earlier today?
[00:50:11.603 --> 00:50:12.224]  This is so good.
[00:50:12.284 --> 00:50:13.204]  Let's turn up Trump.
[00:50:13.304 --> 00:50:14.284]  Thank you very much.
[00:50:14.424 --> 00:50:14.884]  Let's hear him.
[00:50:15.604 --> 00:50:17.745]  The President-elect, 45.
[00:50:18.005 --> 00:50:19.525]  Yeah!
[00:50:22.126 --> 00:50:26.427]  I've just received a call from Secretary Clinton.
[00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:33.416]  She congratulated us.
[00:50:34.176 --> 00:50:35.117]  It's about us.
[00:50:36.197 --> 00:50:37.078]  On our victory.
[00:50:38.459 --> 00:50:44.722]  And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard campaign.
[00:50:44.762 --> 00:50:47.383]  I mean, she fought very hard.
[00:50:48.864 --> 00:50:53.446]  Hillary has worked
[00:50:54.728 --> 00:50:58.229]  Very long and very hard over a long period of time.
[00:50:58.249 --> 00:50:59.249]  She worked hard to bring us down.
[00:50:59.349 --> 00:51:05.410]  And we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.
[00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:07.130]  Let's arrest her immediately.
[00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:07.970]  Oh, I don't like this.
[00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:13.912]  I know he's got to be gracious, but... Now it's time for America to bind the wounds of division.
[00:51:14.172 --> 00:51:15.132]  We have to get together.
[00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:16.232]  He's got to be big, right?
[00:51:16.592 --> 00:51:21.013]  To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation,
[00:51:22.063 --> 00:51:28.387]  I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.
[00:51:28.407 --> 00:51:31.889]  It's time.
[00:51:36.271 --> 00:51:45.317]  I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me.
[00:51:47.208 --> 00:51:49.629]  Ladies and gentlemen, Donald Trump's our new president.
[00:51:49.689 --> 00:51:50.129]  This is awesome!
[00:51:50.149 --> 00:52:06.916]  For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.
[00:52:07.856 --> 00:52:10.758]  You're not going to back off.
[00:52:10.778 --> 00:52:11.498]  We have to go after him.
[00:52:11.518 --> 00:52:12.098]  I agree.
[00:52:12.118 --> 00:52:13.679]  We have to go after him.
[00:52:13.699 --> 00:52:15.840]  We're not looking for trouble, but if you want to fight, you've got to.
[00:52:17.669 --> 00:52:18.349]  Yes, we know.
[00:52:18.369 --> 00:52:19.270]  He's being gracious right now.
[00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:20.971]  The dead people of Benghazi demand it.
[00:52:20.991 --> 00:52:21.691]  Don't you agree, Roger?
[00:52:33.212 --> 00:52:53.067]  It's a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds, and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people and serve the people it will.
[00:52:53.568 --> 00:53:01.034]  Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream.
[00:53:03.476 --> 00:53:10.760]  I've spent my entire life in service looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:12.060]  They're so upset right now.
[00:53:12.861 --> 00:53:16.342]  That is now what I want to do for our country.
[00:53:19.984 --> 00:53:21.265]  Tremendous potential.
[00:53:22.225 --> 00:53:24.106]  I've gotten to know our country so well.
[00:53:24.386 --> 00:53:25.607]  Tremendous potential.
[00:53:26.394 --> 00:53:27.695]  It's gonna be a beautiful thing.
[00:53:28.396 --> 00:53:35.564]  Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential.
[00:53:35.925 --> 00:53:41.111]  The forgotten men and women will be forgotten no longer.
[00:53:43.106 --> 00:53:44.267]  We're going to take care of our veterans.
[00:53:44.307 --> 00:53:46.028]  We're going to cut taxes for any city people.
[00:53:46.108 --> 00:53:46.728]  No problem.
[00:53:46.808 --> 00:53:50.130]  We are going to fix our inner cities.
[00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:55.614]  And we're going to rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals.
[00:53:56.114 --> 00:53:59.236]  We're going to rebuild our infrastructure.
[00:54:01.217 --> 00:54:02.018]  Which will become
[00:54:03.228 --> 00:54:05.490]  By the way, second to none.
[00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:11.193]  And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.
[00:54:11.253 --> 00:54:11.593]  I love it.
[00:54:11.653 --> 00:54:13.475]  Who else would put his youngest kid up on stage?
[00:54:13.495 --> 00:54:14.335]  This is just so great.
[00:54:14.375 --> 00:54:19.138]  We will also finally take care of our great veterans.
[00:54:19.579 --> 00:54:22.741]  He feels most strongly about this.
[00:54:23.261 --> 00:54:26.003]  He's been so loyal and I've gotten to know so many.
[00:54:26.183 --> 00:54:27.684]  I've talked to folks that know the Trumps.
[00:54:27.704 --> 00:54:29.105]  They're just totally in the military.
[00:54:30.248 --> 00:54:35.569]  The time I spent with them during this campaign is among my greatest honors.
[00:54:35.969 --> 00:54:37.530]  Our veterans are incredible people.
[00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:42.411]  We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal.
[00:54:43.031 --> 00:54:52.454]  I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all.
[00:54:52.474 --> 00:54:53.554]  It's gonna happen.
[00:54:55.089 --> 00:54:57.672]  Alright, we got the crew in here, delusionally happy.
[00:54:57.973 --> 00:55:03.179]  Let's hear Trump, what's going on here?
[00:55:03.439 --> 00:55:08.646]  I can't, I mean, look, the thing is, good people never realize we have the power over scum.
[00:55:08.966 --> 00:55:10.087]  We have to rediscover them.
[00:55:13.325 --> 00:55:14.806]  We'll have great relationships.
[00:55:14.966 --> 00:55:18.247]  We expect to have great, great relationships.
[00:55:18.347 --> 00:55:21.289]  No dream is too big, no challenge is too great.
[00:55:21.609 --> 00:55:25.131]  Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.
[00:55:25.431 --> 00:55:30.153]  America will no longer settle for anything less than the best.
[00:55:31.814 --> 00:55:33.535]  Listen, they're going to counter-strike.
[00:55:33.955 --> 00:55:36.576]  I'm not over-confident, I'm under-confident.
[00:55:36.716 --> 00:55:38.657]  Roger, they're going to pull some stuff.
[00:55:39.037 --> 00:55:40.298]  Obama's in for two months.
[00:55:41.464 --> 00:55:45.368]  We've got November, December, January until the 18th.
[00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:46.409]  What do we do?
[00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:47.550]  The pardons.
[00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:50.952]  I've been predicting this year for well over a year.
[00:55:51.413 --> 00:55:53.495]  That's where they will move.
[00:55:54.175 --> 00:55:56.997]  So he should bully Pulp and try to block that?
[00:55:57.478 --> 00:55:57.918]  I would.
[00:55:57.978 --> 00:56:00.360]  Because here's the deal.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.162]  If they wanted to leave and quit, I'd do that.
[00:56:02.202 --> 00:56:03.823]  They're not going to back off.
[00:56:03.843 --> 00:56:05.405]  They're a bunch of arrogant assholes.
[00:56:06.065 --> 00:56:09.408]  Yes, but they've gotten a real taste of defeat tonight.
[00:56:09.753 --> 00:56:12.416]  I thought Reagan's election was the greatest political eye you could have.
[00:56:12.436 --> 00:56:13.557]  This is ten times better.
[00:56:28.316 --> 00:56:31.117]  Oh, the public only knew how good it was.
[00:56:31.217 --> 00:56:32.258]  That's why they're so scared.
[00:56:32.398 --> 00:56:32.758]  Jesus.
[00:56:33.618 --> 00:56:34.919]  God don't wonder they're freaking out.
[00:56:35.259 --> 00:56:36.899]  They've got our phones tapped, everything.
[00:56:36.919 --> 00:56:39.500]  They're hearing the conversations behind the scenes.
[00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:41.661]  Watching Donald Trump.
[00:56:41.761 --> 00:56:43.742]  We read our articles every day.
[00:56:43.982 --> 00:56:45.422]  They're shitting their pants.
[00:56:46.123 --> 00:56:49.424]  We just want to cut taxes, make everybody rich, everybody get along with each other.
[00:56:50.854 --> 00:56:53.896]  They are so pissed right now, all these a**hole bankers.
[00:56:53.916 --> 00:56:58.320]  Crank Trump here, I want to finish.
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:56:59.140]  Where is Robert?
[00:56:59.521 --> 00:57:00.361]  Where is Robert?
[00:57:01.802 --> 00:57:02.783]  My brother, Robert.
[00:57:04.865 --> 00:57:08.007]  And they should all be on this stage, but that's okay.
[00:57:09.448 --> 00:57:10.068]  They are great.
[00:57:10.128 --> 00:57:11.830]  And also, my late brother, Fred.
[00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:12.410]  Great guy.
[00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:15.272]  Fantastic guy.
[00:57:15.352 --> 00:57:16.433]  Fantastic family.
[00:57:16.473 --> 00:57:17.214]  I was very lucky.
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:22.003]  Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents.
[00:57:22.843 --> 00:57:30.528]  To Melania, and Don, and Ivanka, and Tiffany, and Barron,
[00:57:46.395 --> 00:57:52.340]  I love you and I thank you and especially for putting up with all of those hours.
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:53.501]  This was tough.
[00:57:54.782 --> 00:57:55.863]  This was tough.
[00:57:58.185 --> 00:58:01.028]  This political stuff is nasty and it's tough.
[00:58:01.974 --> 00:58:03.974]  So I want to thank my family very much.
[00:58:04.255 --> 00:58:05.395]  Really fantastic.
[00:58:05.435 --> 00:58:06.035]  Thank you all.
[00:58:06.555 --> 00:58:07.175]  Thank you all.
[00:58:07.335 --> 00:58:08.976]  And Lara, unbelievable job.
[00:58:09.616 --> 00:58:10.356]  Unbelievable.
[00:58:10.396 --> 00:58:11.136]  Vanessa, thank you.
[00:58:11.176 --> 00:58:13.316]  Ladies and gentlemen, we just beat the media.
[00:58:13.497 --> 00:58:14.897]  We beat George Soros.
[00:58:14.917 --> 00:58:16.037]  We beat the Rothschilds.
[00:58:16.277 --> 00:58:17.337]  We beat the Rockefellers.
[00:58:17.377 --> 00:58:20.058]  You've all given me such incredible support.
[00:58:20.178 --> 00:58:23.599]  And I will tell you that we have a large group of people.
[00:58:23.619 --> 00:58:25.439]  You know, they kept saying we have a small staff.
[00:58:25.459 --> 00:58:26.179]  Not so small.
[00:58:26.219 --> 00:58:27.600]  Look at all the people that we have.
[00:58:27.980 --> 00:58:29.100]  Look at all of these people.
[00:58:29.915 --> 00:58:32.316]  That does it tonight for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:58:32.496 --> 00:58:32.956]  Thank you, Maggie.
[00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:33.316]  Thank you, Leanne.
[00:58:33.356 --> 00:58:36.317]  Thanks everybody for putting together those clips throughout.
[00:58:36.357 --> 00:58:37.397]  We'll see ya in 2017 all year long.
[00:58:37.417 --> 00:58:37.937]  We made it, guys.
[00:58:39.137 --> 00:58:39.457]  We did.
[00:58:39.497 --> 00:58:40.157]  Happy New Year.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.932]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.441 --> 00:59:24.145]  DNA force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.725 --> 00:59:29.386]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.786 --> 00:59:36.007]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:38.608]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
