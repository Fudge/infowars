[00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:29.101]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:32.463]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:37.888]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we are.
[00:00:37.908 --> 00:00:38.868]  It's Friday.
[00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:45.991]  We're only seven days out from Donald Trump being inaugurated, the 45th president of the United States.
[00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:48.992]  They're already on the verge of repealing Obamacare.
[00:00:49.812 --> 00:00:56.315]  Every week, tens of billions of dollars of more jobs are announced to come back into the United States, the latest Chrysler plants.
[00:00:57.096 --> 00:01:00.140]  We are seeing him come out against vaccines.
[00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:04.145]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I told you that was coming.
[00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:06.168]  This is unbelievable.
[00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:07.811]  We are seeing him.
[00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:15.641]  Openly move to get over a trillion dollars of money back to the United States by changing our tax laws to expose the globalists.
[00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:20.443]  I have the cover of USA Today here in front of me with their weekend edition.
[00:01:20.903 --> 00:01:24.044]  Trump's cabinet of disruptors ready to go.
[00:01:24.204 --> 00:01:28.286]  That's right, they're going to disrupt the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:36.349]  And all the things Trump is delivering on in spades, and he has committed to the American people, he's committed to me.
[00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.153]  I'm going to just leave it at that so the media doesn't have another heyday with it.
[00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:44.038]  That he's going to deliver or basically die trying.
[00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:45.600]  He is going all out.
[00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:55.073]  And that's why we're seeing this unprecedented move, this unprecedented move right now to disrupt the inauguration.
[00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:59.460]  And to actually try to sell the American people on an overthrow of Trump.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:08.563]  The establishment, the globalists, are trying to convince themselves that they can try some coup with Obama with seven days left.
[00:02:08.703 --> 00:02:18.705]  Now, remember, in the last month I've been warning you that they're trying to launch a continued government, COG, basically Operation Valkyrie.
[00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:20.006]  They use COG
[00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.954]  In 1944, to try to kill Hitler, they're caught in a new government system, but it backfired.
[00:02:27.374 --> 00:02:28.795]  Well, they've turned that around now.
[00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:30.677]  They're acting like Trump is illegitimate.
[00:02:31.057 --> 00:02:37.743]  They're trying to sell COG through rogue groups in the government to convince them that what they're doing is okay and normal.
[00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:48.332]  And I've said the left is openly behind the scenes calling for martial law and the arrest of Trump or the blocking of Trump and then a, quote, new election.
[00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.495]  That's why Homeland Security last week announced the federalization and total control of elections.
[00:02:54.876 --> 00:02:59.380]  People said, well, he'll be gone in 10 days or so, you know, last week or 12 days, whatever it was.
[00:03:00.121 --> 00:03:04.105]  But see, not if they suspend this election and say it was fraudulent.
[00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:06.267]  They're seriously thinking about it.
[00:03:06.287 --> 00:03:08.369]  Now, Rosie O'Donnell is one of the top people
[00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.229]  In the New York Hollywood scene.
[00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:14.130]  She's a has-been, but she's a darling with the elites.
[00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.231]  And she has put out an article in Yahoo, we'll put it up on InfoWars.com for everybody right now.
[00:03:20.811 --> 00:03:29.292]  She has come out and openly said that she wants the election suspended because she's a quote Russian agent until that can be cleared up.
[00:03:30.073 --> 00:03:32.193]  Of course it'll never be cleared up, they're the ones running with this info.
[00:03:32.493 --> 00:03:35.294]  And that she wants martial law in place.
[00:03:35.374 --> 00:03:37.354]  Now, CNN
[00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:49.276]  CNN just three weeks ago had a talking point that they put out that I put a lot of attention on where they said civil emergency, national emergency.
[00:03:49.816 --> 00:03:51.918]  I then talked to my sources at CNN.
[00:03:52.873 --> 00:03:54.714]  We also have sources inside ABC News.
[00:03:54.754 --> 00:03:56.115]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:03:56.676 --> 00:04:15.149]  And they said that they are seriously wargaming, just like they got caught before the Gulf War both times, in 1991 and 2003, wargaming the attacks with the exact targets drilled beforehand with a seamless integration of federal government, Pentagon media, through the media.
[00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:16.830]  They are actually wargaming.
[00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.112]  And I'm going to announce this on the other side of the break with David Knight.
[00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.591]  That's the stuff I'm working on behind the scenes.
[00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:27.153]  This is not turning into a vacation, it's turning into an on-the-road emergency transmission.
[00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:36.576]  But bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, they are seriously, notice you heard this from me first, because we have the sources, now you see it actually materializing seven days out.
[00:04:36.636 --> 00:04:37.877]  David Knight, this is incredible.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:50.074]  Alex, and of course, when we look at Rosie O'Donnell, we could say that it's just the rantings of somebody who's a failure, but this is something that has been promoted by George Soros.
[00:04:50.094 --> 00:04:55.942]  We're going to talk him to Michael Snyder today, and he breaks down this group that is going to try to disrupt the inauguration.
[00:04:56.002 --> 00:04:56.603]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.652 --> 00:05:12.393]  Here's Donald Trump on Twitter today.
[00:05:12.413 --> 00:05:13.955]  Now, here is Rosie O'Donnell on Twitter.
[00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:43.235]  I fully support imposing martial law, delaying the inauguration, until Trump is cleared of all charges.
[00:05:43.595 --> 00:05:45.976]  All her hearsay mafia minion followers agreed.
[00:05:46.316 --> 00:05:50.018]  The only problem with that is, there are no charges to be cleared!
[00:05:50.418 --> 00:05:52.500]  Just fake news allegations that you fall for.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.621]  Remember her side of the fence before the election?
[00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:56.121]  When they go low, we go high?
[00:05:56.301 --> 00:05:58.282]  Trump and Republicans need to accept the results?
[00:05:58.503 --> 00:05:59.203]  So much for that.
[00:05:59.403 --> 00:06:00.604]  Two things were confirmed today.
[00:06:00.764 --> 00:06:04.986]  Trump on Twitter is awesome and Rosie O'Donnell is a hypocritical wine bag moron.
[00:06:05.106 --> 00:06:06.227]  Job of the HUD in the flesh.
[00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:08.548]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com
[00:06:10.256 --> 00:06:16.419]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:06:16.799 --> 00:06:19.681]  Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:06:20.021 --> 00:06:25.224]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:06:25.624 --> 00:06:31.607]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:06:31.747 --> 00:06:34.869]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.470]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.834]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:06:41.014 --> 00:06:43.877]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:06:43.957 --> 00:06:45.539]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.822]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:06:49.102 --> 00:06:51.425]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:06:51.705 --> 00:06:52.666]  It's in powder form.
[00:06:52.766 --> 00:06:55.469]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:56.250]  I take this.
[00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.051]  This is the product that I take.
[00:06:58.172 --> 00:07:00.133]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:02.595]  We fight the globals, we fight the new world order.
[00:07:02.896 --> 00:07:09.200]  Secure your DNA force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.563]  We have the new product at Infowarslife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:25.571]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:30.654]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:07:30.774 --> 00:07:33.295]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:07:33.355 --> 00:07:34.836]  It helps detoxify.
[00:07:35.076 --> 00:07:37.897]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:42.700]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.842]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:07:47.282 --> 00:07:48.943]  ...dependent upon selenium.
[00:07:48.983 --> 00:07:54.286]  So it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:55.827]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:07:56.027 --> 00:07:56.747]  This is so key.
[00:07:57.007 --> 00:08:01.310]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.431]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:07.013]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:08:26.941 --> 00:08:30.845]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:32.447 --> 00:08:37.172]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:40.215 --> 00:08:43.259]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday the 13th, 2017.
[00:08:47.998 --> 00:08:48.498]  That's right.
[00:08:48.558 --> 00:08:49.839]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.462]  We are now looking at seven days out of number 45.
[00:08:54.562 --> 00:08:58.785]  President-elect Donald Trump becoming the 45th President of the United States.
[00:08:58.805 --> 00:09:00.406]  I'm going to be here till the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:00.887 --> 00:09:02.928]  David Knight is going to be hot-showing this broadcast.
[00:09:02.988 --> 00:09:14.095]  Again, I will be back in the saddle early next week, and I'll be obviously breaking some very important news over the weekend, if I'm given the green light.
[00:09:14.796 --> 00:09:16.037]  And believe me,
[00:09:16.929 --> 00:09:18.572]  I want to be given the green light.
[00:09:18.612 --> 00:09:19.994]  I do not like sitting on this.
[00:09:21.236 --> 00:09:25.242]  But let's just say this, we're living inside a Tom Clancy novel right now, folks.
[00:09:26.264 --> 00:09:29.669]  But to be a Tom Clancy novel, so fantastic, no one would believe it.
[00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.552]  Because truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:09:33.037 --> 00:09:45.085]  Now, David Knight's going to be augmenting what I'm saying because there's so much evidence that when he popped in during the last segment, if he just joined us, he added key intel to all of it that I hadn't even gotten to, so we're going to be going back and forth here.
[00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:47.306]  But first, let me lay this out for you.
[00:09:47.326 --> 00:09:59.614]  I first began to tell you over a month ago that CNN, ABC, and others were going to start promoting the idea of a civil emergency, a national emergency,
[00:10:00.595 --> 00:10:07.078]  A national security emergency, a continuity of government emergency, or a COG.
[00:10:08.478 --> 00:10:17.282]  Now, under a COG, if a president was actually a foreign agent and that was confirmed, you'd have to have congressional emergency hearings and things like that for it to be constitutional.
[00:10:18.462 --> 00:10:22.484]  The shadow government, the deep state that is publicly attacking Trump now,
[00:10:24.113 --> 00:10:26.814]  Doesn't intend to go that route because they are the deep state.
[00:10:27.014 --> 00:10:28.275]  They are actually the foreigners.
[00:10:28.475 --> 00:10:29.575]  They're actually the globalists.
[00:10:29.615 --> 00:10:33.657]  They're actually the people that have infiltrated the government and are overthrowing our Republic.
[00:10:34.397 --> 00:10:36.178]  Trump is returning the Republic.
[00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:42.040]  Trump is trying to disrupt the globalist operation to impoverish us and make us vassal slaves.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:43.940]  I'm going to break all that down.
[00:10:44.321 --> 00:10:45.521]  But here's the big news.
[00:10:46.661 --> 00:10:48.042]  Over and over again I've told you
[00:10:49.645 --> 00:10:51.647]  And I'm going to go ahead and just release the information today.
[00:10:52.208 --> 00:10:59.655]  I was told over a month ago by sources inside CNN, inside ABC, and others, they said, Alex, you are dead on.
[00:11:00.936 --> 00:11:02.558]  We're up here wargaming.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:20.952]  Civil unrest in and around the inauguration, Trump being arrested, Trump being indicted, the news announcing he's a Russian spy, basically overthrowing the president, putting it into a constitutional crisis, and a national emergency being declared.
[00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:23.934]  So I'm being told this by sources.
[00:11:25.696 --> 00:11:28.938]  One mid-level, one, let's just say high-level.
[00:11:30.339 --> 00:11:33.540]  But on the edge of CNN, let's just say a consultant.
[00:11:34.201 --> 00:11:35.041]  That's what's going on.
[00:11:35.441 --> 00:11:37.542]  That's what's thematically being prepared.
[00:11:37.562 --> 00:11:41.003]  Because they're having to get their own people prepared and lined up.
[00:11:41.063 --> 00:11:56.950]  Just like we saw before the first Gulf War in 1991, and then in 2003, it leaked that ABC, CBS, CNN, all up months before were wargaming with the actual graphics, the attacks that happened, in the exact order they happened, because media was interfacing
[00:11:58.332 --> 00:12:00.934]  With the Pentagon to have seamless propaganda.
[00:12:01.355 --> 00:12:02.515]  Well, let me just explain something.
[00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:04.297]  They are prepping.
[00:12:04.357 --> 00:12:09.821]  They are doing, like when you go have a wedding, well, you know, the day before you'll have a dress rehearsal.
[00:12:10.501 --> 00:12:11.502]  They've had rehearsals.
[00:12:11.562 --> 00:12:12.783]  They've had dress rehearsals.
[00:12:13.463 --> 00:12:15.525]  Now they've started to sell the public on the idea.
[00:12:15.545 --> 00:12:21.809]  Then, after we first talked about that, they began to say on CNN, we need a civil emergency.
[00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:23.691]  We need a national emergency.
[00:12:25.064 --> 00:12:33.667]  To clear up whether or not Trump is a Russian agent, or if these electors don't go for him, we're going to need this crisis as well.
[00:12:33.968 --> 00:12:36.008]  We're going to need this system to take care of the crisis.
[00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:50.614]  Now, it's been intensifying with these rogue intelligence agencies coming out with reports that Russians turned off the East Coast power, or that Russians plan to turn off the East Coast, or that they had a laptop and then, okay, the laptop
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.741]  Didn't even have the software on it.
[00:12:53.901 --> 00:12:54.801]  It's all totally made up.
[00:12:55.381 --> 00:12:57.462]  We've seen hoax after hoax after hoax after hoax.
[00:12:57.502 --> 00:12:59.662]  We've seen three lawsuits saying he raped young girls.
[00:13:00.062 --> 00:13:01.343]  Fake names, totally made up.
[00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:03.163]  But we're all supposed to forget about those.
[00:13:04.324 --> 00:13:07.945]  Now, Rosie O'Donnell, who is a has-been, but that doesn't matter.
[00:13:08.645 --> 00:13:14.307]  In Manhattan, she is a absolute darling of the establishment.
[00:13:14.347 --> 00:13:15.607]  She's dialed into everything.
[00:13:15.627 --> 00:13:18.668]  At the national level, she's seen as the nemesis of Trump.
[00:13:19.907 --> 00:13:31.303]  She comes out uncharacteristically technical with the terms she used that are the exact script they're planning to use if they try to overthrow our president and the return of our republic.
[00:13:31.643 --> 00:13:32.745]  This is from Yahoo News.
[00:13:33.406 --> 00:13:36.390]  Trump's nemesis Rosie O'Donnell calls for martial law.
[00:13:37.498 --> 00:13:38.238]  That's yesterday.
[00:13:38.759 --> 00:13:42.060]  Donald Trump ripped Rosie O'Donnell during his first Republican presidential debate.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.442]  We'll see he deserves it, saying that she was the only woman about whom he'd ever made disparaging comments.
[00:13:47.522 --> 00:13:54.445]  Now, with less than 10 days until Trump takes the Oval Office, O'Donnell says that she'd support martial law.
[00:13:54.465 --> 00:13:54.985]  That's a quote.
[00:13:56.357 --> 00:13:59.018]  In order to delay his inauguration.
[00:13:59.498 --> 00:14:00.998]  Fully support imposing martial law.
[00:14:01.038 --> 00:14:01.618]  This is a quote.
[00:14:02.098 --> 00:14:02.579]  All caps.
[00:14:02.979 --> 00:14:04.439]  Fully support imposing martial law.
[00:14:04.779 --> 00:14:07.800]  Delaying the inauguration until Trump is cleared of all charges.
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.840]  I am fully support martial law.
[00:14:11.161 --> 00:14:12.101]  She goes on from there.
[00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:16.422]  So, again, they are trying to sell this idea.
[00:14:16.442 --> 00:14:17.782]  They are wargaming it.
[00:14:18.262 --> 00:14:20.603]  They are preparing it to the point that on ABC
[00:14:22.481 --> 00:14:26.924]  CNN, MSNBC, anybody can search these terms and pull up these transcripts.
[00:14:27.665 --> 00:14:34.090]  In the last month, they've started floating national emergency, national emergency, national emergency.
[00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:45.878]  We need Obama to declare a national emergency, then they'll announce they're having an investigation for six months until there's a new election, you see.
[00:14:46.038 --> 00:14:49.561]  And then, oh, even if there is a new election, Homeland Security, here's the key,
[00:14:51.072 --> 00:14:53.840]  Federalized the elections last week.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.123]  Now remember, I told you that.
[00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:00.574]  I told you that a month before they actually came out and announced they were going to start the process.
[00:15:01.055 --> 00:15:02.656]  That was a month and a half before the election.
[00:15:03.116 --> 00:15:05.659]  Now people keep asking, how do I keep predicting all this?
[00:15:06.079 --> 00:15:08.041]  Do I have a magical crystal ball?
[00:15:08.161 --> 00:15:17.650]  No, ladies and gentlemen, I have sources throughout the Pentagon, throughout the CIA, throughout the FBI, throughout the federal marshals, and I've got sources even above that.
[00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.594]  I've been on the phone the last week with people in this government
[00:15:23.692 --> 00:15:24.913]  At the highest levels.
[00:15:24.953 --> 00:15:28.756]  I just want listeners to understand, this is not smoke you're getting here.
[00:15:29.036 --> 00:15:31.217]  This is hardcore reality.
[00:15:31.458 --> 00:15:39.023]  And if people think the globalists aren't going to try something when their whole world government is going down in flames worldwide, think again.
[00:15:40.144 --> 00:15:41.364]  The whole table is set.
[00:15:42.425 --> 00:15:43.566]  Meanwhile, another big tell.
[00:15:44.467 --> 00:15:46.568]  And this is an intel I got from sources.
[00:15:46.588 --> 00:15:48.269]  This is what I saw with my eyeballs.
[00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:50.171]  That's usually the best intel for anybody, isn't it?
[00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:53.193]  George Soros doubled the week after
[00:15:54.890 --> 00:16:13.157]  The huge upset on November 8, 2016, he doubled the amount of money he was giving to the Black Lives Matter, the communist groups, the Ford Foundation groups, the destabilization groups, the groups calling for civil unrest, burning down cities, killing cops, knockout game, all this garbage.
[00:16:13.177 --> 00:16:14.938]  And I thought, well, maybe he's just being vindictive.
[00:16:15.418 --> 00:16:17.299]  Then I saw the big foundations
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:25.342]  And I saw, you know, everybody from Kellogg's to the Ford Foundation massively increase what they were giving in one week.
[00:16:25.702 --> 00:16:29.043]  They were giving $1 million, $2 million, $3 million, $5 million apiece.
[00:16:29.603 --> 00:16:34.624]  Over 30 major corporations were giving over a million apiece, some $3-$4 million.
[00:16:35.064 --> 00:16:37.305]  Soros gave $100 million additional that week.
[00:16:38.141 --> 00:16:50.109]  So, ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about a massive, massive, quadrupling down ahead of this inauguration with them busing in, reportedly, hundreds of thousands of agitators.
[00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.490]  We have it in the WikiLeaks.
[00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.431]  They give them drugs.
[00:16:52.731 --> 00:16:53.652]  They give them alcohol.
[00:16:54.032 --> 00:16:56.454]  They pay the average person $200 a day.
[00:16:56.834 --> 00:17:02.318]  Some agitators are paid $1,400 a day to physically attack people.
[00:17:02.718 --> 00:17:04.700]  Then Soros' lawyers get them out of prison.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.441]  This guy's overthrown Ukraine.
[00:17:07.245 --> 00:17:09.667]  This guy's over from the Middle East, or the Arab Spring.
[00:17:10.047 --> 00:17:15.171]  They mean business, and their mouths are wet with the blood of the innocents.
[00:17:16.352 --> 00:17:21.135]  They've got a bloodthirsty taste of victory in all these other countries, and they really think they can do this.
[00:17:21.155 --> 00:17:22.856]  Trump is aware of what's going on.
[00:17:22.876 --> 00:17:26.699]  Trump has plans in place, but everybody better know this.
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:28.881]  Be ready to call C-SPAN.
[00:17:28.901 --> 00:17:30.081]  Be ready to call talk radio.
[00:17:30.141 --> 00:17:34.905]  Be ready to really take action, get a buzz going out there, that they better not try martial law.
[00:17:36.073 --> 00:17:41.618]  Because that's the kind of thing that can spook them off of doing this if their program is exposed.
[00:17:41.638 --> 00:17:53.690]  And another thing Trump needs to do, he needs to get into the hack that happened two years ago that we learned about last year, the OPM hack of $14 million, then we learned $20 million.
[00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:57.551]  I don't know.
[00:18:17.466 --> 00:18:17.706]  We're good.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.402]  He needs to come out and say, Hillary, you got money from the Communist Chinese.
[00:18:42.462 --> 00:18:44.162]  You got money from the Saudi Arabians.
[00:18:44.202 --> 00:18:48.824]  Here are the newspapers where they bragged they gave you money, and where the whole media was on your side.
[00:18:49.244 --> 00:18:50.925]  Stop changing the subject onto Russia.
[00:18:50.965 --> 00:18:51.625]  You're a liar.
[00:18:52.045 --> 00:18:55.426]  Your, you know, podesta people took 30-something million from the Russians.
[00:18:55.687 --> 00:18:57.067]  You met with Putin in secret.
[00:18:57.487 --> 00:18:59.928]  And so stop claiming that I've done what you've done.
[00:19:00.348 --> 00:19:02.069]  If he hits her with that, it's over.
[00:19:02.842 --> 00:19:11.429]  And I know Trump's got a lot of stuff going on in his mind, and he's got Spicer advising him, which is fine, but I'm seeing a lot of softballs being thrown back by Spicer and others.
[00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.452]  Every time the President-elect throws balls, they're hard.
[00:19:15.093 --> 00:19:24.601]  We pointed out the whole hack last week via tweet, but one tweet about the Office of Personnel Management, that is not enough.
[00:19:24.661 --> 00:19:28.324]  We need to hammer the daylights out of this, but let's back up for a moment.
[00:19:29.426 --> 00:19:35.556]  I'm bringing David Knight in here because he's got Mr. Schreiner coming on for a full hour to break all this down and go over every facet of this.
[00:19:36.478 --> 00:19:40.605]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're nakedly saying they want to overturn the election.
[00:19:41.457 --> 00:19:46.059]  They're nakedly trying with the electors and the recounts and all the rest of it.
[00:19:46.159 --> 00:19:52.082]  And remember, every time they were trying that, they'd say, well, we're not trying to have the electors overturn the election.
[00:19:52.102 --> 00:19:54.684]  That's a conspiracy theory of Alex Jones.
[00:19:54.704 --> 00:19:56.905]  Remember Nancy Pelosi's daughter leading the effort?
[00:19:57.325 --> 00:19:59.066]  And she said, I'm getting death threats.
[00:19:59.146 --> 00:20:01.967]  Alex Jones wants to be dead on Kabuto.
[00:20:02.287 --> 00:20:03.088]  Totally made up.
[00:20:04.008 --> 00:20:05.109]  No, I'm not threatening her.
[00:20:05.129 --> 00:20:06.189]  I'm not saying go after her.
[00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:07.590]  I said, she's leading the charge.
[00:20:08.459 --> 00:20:13.565]  They have the electors overturn this election, put things into crisis, federalize the election.
[00:20:13.585 --> 00:20:14.706]  This is a soft coup.
[00:20:15.207 --> 00:20:18.311]  Well, they're pissed because I called them on what they were doing.
[00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:28.383]  Pelosi then went and literally tried to get Loretta Lynch to cook up some federal lawsuit before they left office to try to have me basically indicted.
[00:20:29.905 --> 00:20:35.610]  I mean, these people are that crazy that her daughter is running around trying to overturn the election.
[00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:36.891]  I call her on it.
[00:20:37.271 --> 00:20:39.012]  She goes and cries to mommy.
[00:20:39.533 --> 00:20:42.235]  I tell everybody about it in the morning at 11 a.m.
[00:20:42.595 --> 00:20:46.998]  and then that afternoon she's on Kabuto saying the exact thing on national TV.
[00:20:47.358 --> 00:20:48.799]  What I'm telling you listeners is...
[00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:51.512]  I'm not bragging about the show.
[00:20:51.813 --> 00:20:55.315]  I'm telling you, this is the broadcast the intelligence agencies listen to.
[00:20:55.335 --> 00:20:57.697]  This is what the President-elect listens to.
[00:20:57.717 --> 00:21:00.460]  This is what anybody who's got half a brain listens to.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.061]  This is what drugs listens to.
[00:21:02.081 --> 00:21:04.763]  It's what Congress listens to, because they listen to you.
[00:21:04.783 --> 00:21:06.405]  It isn't about Alex Jones.
[00:21:06.745 --> 00:21:12.530]  It's about the family of listeners and activists and guest hosts and all of us together are the Brain Trust.
[00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:14.070]  And we are the source.
[00:21:14.751 --> 00:21:22.633]  We're given the information to respond to the globalists, and the info I've been given from our sources has been 100% dead on.
[00:21:22.673 --> 00:21:24.014]  There is a real resistance.
[00:21:24.354 --> 00:21:29.135]  This country is in total crisis, but amazing historical things are happening right now.
[00:21:29.615 --> 00:21:31.656]  Now, David Knight, I've laid out a lot of points here.
[00:21:31.676 --> 00:21:34.617]  They're prepping the public for a civil emergency.
[00:21:35.688 --> 00:21:39.552]  That's a fancy term for martial law, just like a bunch of made-up internet crap.
[00:21:39.712 --> 00:21:43.076]  It's not just some sleazy, you know, internet message board.
[00:21:43.116 --> 00:21:44.478]  You call it a dossier.
[00:21:44.878 --> 00:21:47.662]  Well, if you're preparing martial law, you don't call it martial law.
[00:21:47.982 --> 00:21:52.728]  You call it National Emergency with Obama making it all racial.
[00:21:53.448 --> 00:22:07.648]  You know, triggering riots nationwide, claiming the people don't accept Trump, they don't accept a Russian agent, he's got to accept emergency elections while he's under investigation, they'll indict a bunch of his underlings.
[00:22:08.168 --> 00:22:09.791]  That's the soft power move.
[00:22:10.411 --> 00:22:12.193]  They might blow up Trump Tower.
[00:22:12.313 --> 00:22:14.295]  I'm sorry to talk like this, but anything can happen.
[00:22:14.635 --> 00:22:16.717]  They might attack him during the inauguration.
[00:22:17.298 --> 00:22:22.923]  These people are not giving up until we get on the offense and let them know, we know who you are.
[00:22:23.504 --> 00:22:24.505]  We know what you're doing.
[00:22:24.945 --> 00:22:26.486]  Yes, Nancy Pelosi's daughter.
[00:22:26.506 --> 00:22:28.028]  I bet you did get some mean
[00:22:28.168 --> 00:22:28.768]  We're good to go.
[00:22:58.647 --> 00:23:00.268]  Killing this country is being overthrown.
[00:23:00.308 --> 00:23:05.452]  He's too busy giving Biden the Medal of Freedom award where both of them cry as narcissistic loons.
[00:23:05.852 --> 00:23:15.699]  He's too busy saying, we'll take anybody from anywhere in the world with no evidence of who you are, known jihadis, you name it, but if the Cubans are fleeing tyranny, they can't come here.
[00:23:15.719 --> 00:23:18.421]  He's just enacted that with eight days out.
[00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:20.002]  We're now seven days out.
[00:23:20.542 --> 00:23:30.864]  And here on Friday the 13th, I want the listeners to understand the incredible, historic, life-changing, once-in-a-lifetime events that we're seeing unfold.
[00:23:31.204 --> 00:23:33.725]  David, what do you think of this overall breakdown I put out there?
[00:23:34.365 --> 00:23:35.485]  This is interesting, Alex.
[00:23:35.565 --> 00:23:39.286]  One of the last things you mentioned is Obama's move now against Cubans.
[00:23:39.326 --> 00:23:40.326]  I grew up in Florida.
[00:23:40.446 --> 00:23:42.166]  I knew a lot of Cubans.
[00:23:42.186 --> 00:23:44.087]  And they were real free market people.
[00:23:44.227 --> 00:23:48.828]  And so that's the only group that Obama doesn't want to have come in the United States.
[00:23:49.868 --> 00:23:50.849]  I think that's kind of interesting.
[00:23:50.869 --> 00:23:58.057]  But when you're talking about Soros, you know, we look at Rosie O'Donnell, and clearly the rhetoric that she's got out here is inflammatory, you know.
[00:23:58.077 --> 00:24:10.309]  But the issue is, whether wittingly or unwittingly, what she's doing is supporting the efforts of George Soros, Bill Ayers, Black Lives Matter, and the rest of these people who, the day after the election, started with violence.
[00:24:10.349 --> 00:24:12.772]  Now, Michael Snyder that's coming up in the next hour, Alex,
[00:24:13.332 --> 00:24:25.206]  He pointed out in this article some of the more moderate groups are talking about things like civil resistance, civil disobedience, but the others are openly talking about blockades, they're talking about citywide paralysis, and listen, Alex, to who this is.
[00:24:25.526 --> 00:24:30.752]  People like Cornel West, or Educator, put that word in quotes, Educator Bill Ayers.
[00:24:31.212 --> 00:24:36.838]  And Carl Dix of the Communist Party USA, and their group is called Disrupt J20, Disrupt January the 20th.
[00:24:36.858 --> 00:24:39.881]  So we're going to be talking to him about that in the next hour.
[00:24:40.161 --> 00:24:41.523]  But that's precisely what this is.
[00:24:41.543 --> 00:24:49.050]  And yesterday, Glenn Greenwald said, look, the left is going hysterical, they're losing, they lost to Trump, and they're upset about this.
[00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:52.434]  He says, if you don't like their policies, and Glenn Greenwald said, I don't like Trump,
[00:24:53.034 --> 00:24:56.136]  But I'm going to oppose him in the marketplace of ideas.
[00:24:56.216 --> 00:25:06.663]  There's other ways to do this other than embracing the kind of tactics that have been used in other countries to overthrow their governments by the CIA and embracing that here at home.
[00:25:06.963 --> 00:25:07.843]  And that's the real issue.
[00:25:07.883 --> 00:25:08.384]  That's what he said.
[00:25:08.404 --> 00:25:11.065]  The deep state has come out and declared war against Donald Trump.
[00:25:11.866 --> 00:25:12.166]  That's right.
[00:25:12.186 --> 00:25:15.068]  The deep state exactly has declared war against Donald Trump.
[00:25:15.708 --> 00:25:16.789]  And here's what I'm getting at.
[00:25:17.169 --> 00:25:18.210]  Just like when the month
[00:25:19.125 --> 00:25:22.249]  Before they went after the electors, they were going after them covertly.
[00:25:22.749 --> 00:25:25.552]  We were exposing it, and they would say, oh, you're a conspiracy terrorist.
[00:25:26.013 --> 00:25:27.414]  No one's going after the electors.
[00:25:27.835 --> 00:25:30.978]  They don't want any opposition to mount to their ongoing programs.
[00:25:31.219 --> 00:25:40.349]  So what I'm saying is they're currently, with seven days left, seriously trying, not just the moron left, but the deep state, to sell the public
[00:25:41.571 --> 00:25:45.993]  On the suspension of the election, a national emergency, and basically martial law.
[00:25:46.273 --> 00:25:53.376]  And that's why you hear Rosie O'Donnell saying this, because these talking points are being discussed by the leftists in newspapers.
[00:25:53.436 --> 00:26:01.100]  I mean, they're in the New York Times, they're in the Washington Post, calling for impeachment to begin right away, calling for a suspension of this election.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.281]  They're already calling for it.
[00:26:03.761 --> 00:26:05.061]  It's so unconstitutional.
[00:26:05.101 --> 00:26:05.862]  It's so naked.
[00:26:05.902 --> 00:26:06.682]  It's so brazen.
[00:26:07.242 --> 00:26:14.905]  We are having trouble believing they're even doing this, but I'm trying to assure everyone they are currently moving and are currently trying this because, look,
[00:26:16.247 --> 00:26:19.909]  Even Bernie Sanders has had to come out and say, okay, Trump's right on trade.
[00:26:20.049 --> 00:26:22.090]  Okay, Trump's right on bringing the tax money back.
[00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:26.992]  Okay, Trump really is bringing jobs back because his own constituents are turning against Sanders.
[00:26:27.492 --> 00:26:30.753]  Sanders is a slime ball, but he understands which way the wind is blowing.
[00:26:31.294 --> 00:26:33.195]  He understands real prosperities here.
[00:26:33.775 --> 00:26:34.035]  Trump...
[00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:39.132]  Trump is turning off all the globalist policies that have made this country a rust bucket.
[00:26:39.412 --> 00:26:41.093]  The globalists are in full panic.
[00:26:41.153 --> 00:26:44.675]  Trump intends, folks, to completely deliver.
[00:26:44.975 --> 00:26:49.417]  Then it'll just be up to us to be moral and hardworking and save money and be good people.
[00:26:49.617 --> 00:26:54.139]  But this country and the world, America doing well will make the rest of the world do well.
[00:26:54.219 --> 00:26:55.460]  It's not a zero-sum game.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.782]  It's a non-zero-sum game, or a 361, as we talk about.
[00:26:59.182 --> 00:27:01.483]  And Trump understands that the engine of liberty
[00:27:02.003 --> 00:27:07.348]  The engine of renaissance will empower the entire world for anybody that wants to work hard and be moral.
[00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:11.833]  So they are in complete and total panic mode.
[00:27:11.853 --> 00:27:17.078]  And as you said, David, they are activating the Soros cells to disrupt and block.
[00:27:17.118 --> 00:27:22.223]  It's being literally led by a former head of the Weathermen Underground.
[00:27:23.078 --> 00:27:23.980]  We're good to go.
[00:27:39.928 --> 00:27:40.889]  We're good to go.
[00:27:56.796 --> 00:27:58.237]  We're good to go.
[00:28:27.457 --> 00:28:28.037]  You can come here.
[00:28:28.077 --> 00:28:29.459]  You've got diseases, you can come here.
[00:28:29.519 --> 00:28:31.320]  You've got no documentation, you can come here.
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.642]  You want to come here and have a baby for free?
[00:28:32.802 --> 00:28:33.302]  You can come here.
[00:28:33.563 --> 00:28:46.375]  But you're a bunch of Cubans fleeing 50-something years of absolute total tyranny and hundreds of thousands murdered and millions in prison, and you come here and you're active, you're pro-gun, you're pro-America, you're pro-freedom.
[00:28:46.635 --> 00:28:48.597]  I can't tell you how many times it's Cuban-Americans
[00:28:49.017 --> 00:28:52.022]  Fighting tyranny, 10 to 1 what other Americans are doing.
[00:28:52.303 --> 00:28:53.605]  And the globalists are in panic mode.
[00:28:53.625 --> 00:28:55.528]  They're like, no more of these Cubans.
[00:28:55.829 --> 00:28:56.690]  You keep them out.
[00:28:56.991 --> 00:28:59.995]  It shows the complete evil agenda of these people, David.
[00:29:00.728 --> 00:29:10.153]  Yeah, you know Alex, we were talking about the Electoral College, and of course we saw that happen with the nomination, we saw it with the election, and they say, hey, we're going to get people to overthrow the votes of the voters in the various states.
[00:29:10.193 --> 00:29:20.799]  But also remember that it was Evan McMullin, former CIA guy, that Glenn Beck and others pushed in Utah to try to block Trump from getting an electoral majority.
[00:29:20.859 --> 00:29:22.920]  They thought that would be a very effective strategy.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.341]  They didn't realize just how far out he was.
[00:29:25.661 --> 00:29:26.922]  But of course, this is a guy who went
[00:29:27.302 --> 00:29:30.623]  To meet with ISIS, went with John McCain to meet with ISIS.
[00:29:30.923 --> 00:29:33.543]  Evan McMullin, this is the guy they picked, the CIA operative.
[00:29:34.324 --> 00:29:35.844]  Exactly, David, that's why you're so great.
[00:29:35.864 --> 00:29:38.185]  You'll bring up all the backstory, all the background.
[00:29:38.205 --> 00:29:45.586]  This whole thing, our rogue, criminal, multinational corporate agents that have infiltrated the CIA, the NSA.
[00:29:45.866 --> 00:29:50.627]  These bodies were set up, especially the CIA, to bring America into globalism.
[00:29:50.947 --> 00:29:52.908]  It was set up from the beginning out of
[00:29:53.548 --> 00:29:54.969]  The whole Rhodes Scholarship.
[00:29:55.229 --> 00:29:56.850]  It was all a Cecil Rhodes plan.
[00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.250]  He wrote multiple books on it.
[00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:01.972]  They set up the Pratt House in New York in 1921 to do it.
[00:30:02.372 --> 00:30:05.734]  The CFR, that's the World Commission on International Affairs.
[00:30:10.933 --> 00:30:12.153]  Wars are not cheap.
[00:30:12.873 --> 00:30:16.714]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[00:30:17.435 --> 00:30:20.215]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[00:30:20.795 --> 00:30:21.796]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[00:30:21.816 --> 00:30:23.316]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[00:30:23.916 --> 00:30:30.698]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[00:30:31.058 --> 00:30:35.379]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[00:30:36.019 --> 00:30:45.123]  That's why on major third party sites we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:57.729]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically and try to free this republic of the world.
[00:30:58.129 --> 00:30:59.790]  We apply to the products we bring in.
[00:31:00.709 --> 00:31:07.072]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[00:31:07.693 --> 00:31:12.035]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[00:31:12.055 --> 00:31:13.335]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[00:31:13.796 --> 00:31:15.797]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've...
[00:31:16.437 --> 00:31:21.098]  We've got to be produced at the highest pressures, even past California standards, which is almost impossible to do.
[00:31:21.138 --> 00:31:21.839]  That's the whole point of it.
[00:31:22.079 --> 00:31:22.839]  So stop supplements.
[00:31:22.859 --> 00:31:24.299]  But we go to that standard.
[00:31:24.439 --> 00:31:27.280]  But we've got a whole bunch of the products that are still available right now.
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:32.101]  And I want to extend to all of you those specials to make our bodies great again.
[00:31:32.121 --> 00:31:33.582]  Because our bodies are our temples.
[00:31:33.642 --> 00:31:35.683]  And look, I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[00:31:36.103 --> 00:31:37.083]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[00:31:37.103 --> 00:31:38.723]  I dedicated myself to working out.
[00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:39.384]  I was in great shape.
[00:31:39.424 --> 00:31:40.464]  I'm dedicated to fighting the globulus.
[00:31:40.704 --> 00:31:41.304]  I ate a lot of weight.
[00:31:41.324 --> 00:31:43.065]  But I've lost over 60, 70 pounds.
[00:31:44.845 --> 00:31:45.585]  Uh, of fat.
[00:31:45.765 --> 00:31:47.446]  I've probably gained 20-30 pounds of muscle.
[00:31:48.106 --> 00:31:49.987]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:54.969]  Now, it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:31:55.529 --> 00:32:05.312]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[00:32:05.332 --> 00:32:06.152]  170-plus studies.
[00:32:06.172 --> 00:32:07.153]  We can make claims on this.
[00:32:07.173 --> 00:32:13.235]  This thing is like the Holy Grail, basically, of nerve regrowth, detoxification, antioxidant.
[00:32:14.055 --> 00:32:15.838]  I've got this at my fingertips, at cost.
[00:32:15.918 --> 00:32:16.699]  I forget to take it.
[00:32:16.719 --> 00:32:17.640]  I forget to give it to my kids.
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.542]  I forget to, you know, push it on my parents.
[00:32:19.622 --> 00:32:21.805]  This is God's gift to us through nature.
[00:32:22.266 --> 00:32:22.847]  Well, guess what?
[00:32:22.867 --> 00:32:24.108]  DNA Force is coming back in.
[00:32:24.489 --> 00:32:25.089]  It's discounted.
[00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.374]  Now, in the next few weeks, a lot of these products that have sold out are coming back in.
[00:32:28.394 --> 00:32:29.815]  A lot of the products we have left
[00:32:30.356 --> 00:32:35.120]  We still have some supplies of and will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:40.244]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.
[00:32:40.584 --> 00:32:41.685]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[00:32:43.126 --> 00:32:44.947]  Secret 12, 20% off.
[00:32:45.108 --> 00:32:46.268]  Liver Shield, 20% off.
[00:32:46.489 --> 00:32:48.130]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:51.473]  Knockout, the amazing sleep aid, I love taking it every day, 20% off.
[00:32:51.733 --> 00:32:52.954]  Prostagard, 20% off.
[00:32:53.294 --> 00:32:55.175]  And many others at fullwarslife.com.
[00:32:56.056 --> 00:32:59.579]  You are literally energizing this operation against the globalists.
[00:32:59.659 --> 00:33:08.044]  I want to again salute you all and ask you to go check out the amazing specials we've got running right now for 2017 in the month of January.
[00:33:08.264 --> 00:33:09.325]  Make our bodies great again.
[00:33:19.916 --> 00:33:29.043]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:30.984 --> 00:33:37.009]  Alright, Alex Jones here from the road, about to hand the baton to David Knight, and David's doing such a great job trying to get a word in.
[00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:43.994]  Ed Schweizer will have a couple hours to break all this down and lay this out for you, and hopefully later also open the phones up and take your calls.
[00:33:44.014 --> 00:33:45.735]  But as he was just getting into,
[00:33:46.832 --> 00:33:57.656]  We have the CIA, former field commander up in Utah, starting this whole elector deal and trying to get electors to turn against Trump.
[00:33:58.177 --> 00:34:03.579]  This started basically the day after the election on November 9th.
[00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:11.314]  Before that, he was trying to get Utahns to vote for him so they could broker a deal and basically still defeat Trump.
[00:34:11.654 --> 00:34:19.599]  And this guy admittedly works for McCain, as David Knight just said, went over and met with ISIS, met with al-Nusra, met with Al-Qaeda.
[00:34:19.959 --> 00:34:23.041]  These are truly monstrous, monstrous individuals.
[00:34:23.542 --> 00:34:24.302]  But guess what we did?
[00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:29.345]  We came out before the election and after it and said, this guy's a scumbag.
[00:34:30.086 --> 00:34:32.467]  And again, I don't want to sit here and just say it's all CIA.
[00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:33.768]  I'm not defending the CIA either.
[00:34:34.608 --> 00:34:49.473]  It's criminals, it's globalists, it's corrupt individuals, it's operatives of this system that wants to basically enslave everybody that are inside and in control of these institutions that are above the law.
[00:34:49.833 --> 00:34:56.535]  The CIA, according to its charter, under the National Security Act of 1947, is basically above the law and invisible.
[00:34:57.578 --> 00:34:59.839]  It's worse than the UN with its diplomatic immunity.
[00:34:59.859 --> 00:35:01.260]  I mean, it has license to kill.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.641]  It's out of control.
[00:35:02.841 --> 00:35:06.683]  It's a perfect system for a takeover of the country.
[00:35:07.003 --> 00:35:15.028]  The group claiming they're protecting the country are really the ones using the country to dominate and take over the world at our expense.
[00:35:15.788 --> 00:35:17.549]  That's about to come to an end.
[00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:18.970]  They have mismanaged things.
[00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:22.492]  Even from a Machiavellian perspective, they have not delivered.
[00:35:23.801 --> 00:35:27.424]  Even on their promise to their own controllers, they have destabilized the world.
[00:35:27.684 --> 00:35:38.691]  They have created a more evil world, a more unstable world, and so they're being rejected, and Americanism, not globalism, is returning, and the New World Order is panicking.
[00:35:38.731 --> 00:35:45.736]  So, I want to play this Grathwald clip, the FBI informant, from his meetings inside the Weather Underground with Bill Ayers.
[00:35:46.136 --> 00:35:49.979]  This is who was just given hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:35:50.539 --> 00:35:59.911]  By the big foundations and the big Fortune 100, and George Soros gave over $100 million right after the election to these groups, but hundreds of millions more.
[00:35:59.931 --> 00:36:01.553]  I mean, the numbers, it's just unknown.
[00:36:02.214 --> 00:36:03.696]  It's billions the last few years.
[00:36:04.197 --> 00:36:09.043]  But since the election just a few months ago, massive funding of this individual.
[00:36:11.679 --> 00:36:15.224]  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government.
[00:36:16.806 --> 00:36:22.994]  We become responsible then for administrating 250 million people.
[00:36:25.097 --> 00:36:26.098]  And there was no answers.
[00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.402]  No one had given any thought to economics.
[00:36:30.615 --> 00:36:32.536]  How are you going to clothe and feed these people?
[00:36:33.717 --> 00:36:44.122]  The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans and the North Vietnamese and the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United States.
[00:36:45.242 --> 00:36:50.745]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution.
[00:36:52.356 --> 00:37:02.260]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[00:37:04.748 --> 00:37:13.891]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be.
[00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:18.373]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[00:37:18.393 --> 00:37:21.133]  That are die-hard capitalists?
[00:37:22.234 --> 00:37:24.895]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[00:37:26.295 --> 00:37:31.337]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people.
[00:37:32.509 --> 00:37:34.070]  In these re-education centers.
[00:37:34.731 --> 00:37:37.813]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[00:37:38.033 --> 00:37:38.693]  25 million people.
[00:37:39.594 --> 00:37:54.945]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers, and hear them
[00:37:56.368 --> 00:38:00.810]  Figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people.
[00:38:01.271 --> 00:38:02.992]  And they were dead serious.
[00:38:04.492 --> 00:38:06.814]  Now, people ask why I get upset on air.
[00:38:06.994 --> 00:38:08.975]  And it's because I've got hundreds of points I want to make.
[00:38:09.055 --> 00:38:10.235]  I'm teleprompter free.
[00:38:10.296 --> 00:38:18.320]  And I'm just so upset and frustrated because I know we're up against people just like Larry Grathwald, who just died a few years ago and was breaking down.
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.921]  By the way, I interviewed him several times over the years.
[00:38:20.941 --> 00:38:22.982]  I didn't know how sick he was right before he died.
[00:38:23.002 --> 00:38:23.623]  I interviewed him.
[00:38:24.123 --> 00:38:25.764]  We should probably dig that interview up and
[00:38:26.425 --> 00:38:34.945]  I think after Trump gets inaugurated and gets in, we should probably take some of the folks that aren't here with us anymore and posthumously give them awards.
[00:38:35.982 --> 00:38:36.462]  We're good to go.
[00:38:58.841 --> 00:38:59.982]  We're good to go.
[00:39:10.331 --> 00:39:13.814]  Identities, an entire system to roll up the entire U.S.
[00:39:13.834 --> 00:39:15.736]  spy network and all of their assets.
[00:39:16.236 --> 00:39:17.417]  They blew us wide open.
[00:39:17.437 --> 00:39:18.378]  They brought us down.
[00:39:18.818 --> 00:39:19.759]  They sold us out.
[00:39:20.239 --> 00:39:24.583]  That's another reason you're seeing this whole struggle right now is because they've just gone so far.
[00:39:25.063 --> 00:39:38.014]  They've opened the borders for three years and let people in that they know have syphilis, drug-resistant TB, and yes, even things like flesh-eating bacteria and, of course, leprosy.
[00:39:38.906 --> 00:39:47.270]  I would tell people about leprosy three years ago, because I have health department sources in Florida, Texas, and California, and they would say, oh, you're crazy, there's no leprosy.
[00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:48.870]  Well, now it's in the Associated Press.
[00:39:49.191 --> 00:40:03.637]  They put kids with leprosy in schools in Texas and in California, in liberal areas, and then let it spread, and then use it as a test case with the health departments through DHS to see if they can cover it up.
[00:40:04.817 --> 00:40:11.763]  Just like they used Ebola cases all over the United States, and they were all over the United States, and it even came out here and there as a cover-up drill.
[00:40:12.324 --> 00:40:27.997]  All of this is testing what they can get away with, and a criminal, globalist, multinational cabal is in control of the CIA, the robber barons set up the UN to transfer our power to it and other multinational groups like TPP and the WTO.
[00:40:28.517 --> 00:40:30.439]  We're now awakening to that and saying no.
[00:40:31.551 --> 00:40:43.213]  And so now they are openly, just like they did with the electors and the recount, nobody believed me until it started happening, they're now priming the pump for civil emergency in the next seven days with huge riots kicking off.
[00:40:43.713 --> 00:40:45.034]  I'm not saying this is going to happen.
[00:40:45.694 --> 00:40:51.435]  I'm saying they're planning it, they admit it, they have been prepping it, they're saying that the election should be suspended.
[00:40:51.455 --> 00:40:55.876]  And so I'm going to ask David this as I leave, okay?
[00:40:55.896 --> 00:40:57.596]  I want him to think and write some notes here.
[00:40:59.241 --> 00:41:02.943]  David, and I want to ask Snyder, coming up, I want to ask you, the listeners, I want to create a debate around this.
[00:41:03.084 --> 00:41:10.208]  What do we do, with seven days down, here on Friday the 13th, to focus attention on this, and to expose it?
[00:41:10.228 --> 00:41:25.218]  I think we tweeted Trump, we write articles, we put out videos, we tell Trump, hey, you've done a great job, we think you need to come out and point out that Hillary was bought off by the Chinese and the Saudi Arabians, and that's why you've changed the subject onto Russia.
[00:41:26.429 --> 00:41:28.770]  And then you're going to be investigating Hillary, which is now being announced.
[00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:29.630]  Take the gloves off.
[00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:32.150]  They knew Trump was always going after Hillary.
[00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.270]  He was always going to drain the swamp.
[00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.411]  He was always going to lock her up.
[00:41:35.171 --> 00:41:37.071]  But he had to play possum.
[00:41:37.111 --> 00:41:38.572]  They now know it was always possum.
[00:41:38.832 --> 00:41:40.092]  So this is a death battle, folks.
[00:41:40.472 --> 00:41:41.392]  This is an epic time.
[00:41:41.452 --> 00:41:42.252]  Call in the C-SPAN.
[00:41:42.272 --> 00:41:43.132]  Call in other talk shows.
[00:41:44.873 --> 00:41:46.013]  Get all over the internet.
[00:41:46.053 --> 00:41:46.913]  Comment everywhere.
[00:41:46.933 --> 00:41:48.814]  Do banner hangs on highways.
[00:41:49.194 --> 00:41:50.374]  Whatever is legal and lawful.
[00:41:51.154 --> 00:41:52.095]  Come to D.C.
[00:41:52.155 --> 00:41:58.279]  to stand up against these communists in a peaceful way and totally outnumber them like we did in Cleveland so they shrunk back in their holes.
[00:41:59.179 --> 00:42:01.281]  Now in closing, I'm gonna hand the baton to David Knight.
[00:42:02.225 --> 00:42:06.508]  I get so focused on fighting the globalists, I don't even plug our products or what we do here.
[00:42:06.628 --> 00:42:18.217]  Whether it's anti-globalist t-shirts or Molon lobby t-shirts, whether it's non-GMO heirloom seeds, or whether it's the supplements, we're just extending sales of whatever's still in stock and whatever's come back in, like selenium was sold out.
[00:42:18.697 --> 00:42:20.558]  Biotriz Selenium, truly amazing, that's back.
[00:42:21.499 --> 00:42:25.402]  DNA Force is back, that is 10% off, that has been sold out for two months.
[00:42:26.282 --> 00:42:29.686]  We have, what, 30% off on a whole bunch of the products.
[00:42:30.466 --> 00:42:32.148]  Brain Force, our amazing nootropic.
[00:42:32.788 --> 00:42:35.251]  More Super Metal Vitality came in, but a limited amount.
[00:42:35.271 --> 00:42:36.672]  It'll be a month until more comes in.
[00:42:37.152 --> 00:42:38.093]  That's about to sell out.
[00:42:39.394 --> 00:42:41.957]  But we've got a whole bunch of stuff discounted.
[00:42:42.037 --> 00:42:46.161]  Later David can list it all, but it's at m4warsstore.com or m4warslive.com.
[00:42:47.284 --> 00:43:04.490]  But whatever you do, support the broadcast, spread the link, spread the videos, but also, these are great products, whether it's Prostagard, or whether it's our super high quality Mediterranean organic oil of oregano caplets, that are 100% pure and absorb right into your body, the very best out there.
[00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:11.612]  Whether it's the SleepAid Knockout, whether it's the Lung Cleanse, whether it's the Liver Shield, whether it's the Natural Defense Parasite Cleanse,
[00:43:12.092 --> 00:43:18.717]  It's all available at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:43:18.957 --> 00:43:20.278]  We have almost 30 products now.
[00:43:20.658 --> 00:43:22.840]  Ingenuity is another great company I work with.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.341]  They have over 400 products.
[00:43:24.481 --> 00:43:31.446]  InfoWarsTeam.com when you get Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0 or Polymburst or the Osseo FX products.
[00:43:32.106 --> 00:43:35.308]  When you sign up for auto ship, you get free shipping.
[00:43:35.668 --> 00:43:37.949]  When you sign up to be a distributor, you get big discounts.
[00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:42.572]  And a small part of the money that they make goes to fund our operation.
[00:43:42.612 --> 00:43:44.853]  About 5, 6, 7 percent, depending on what you purchase.
[00:43:45.194 --> 00:43:46.554]  And that helps fund the operation.
[00:43:46.854 --> 00:43:53.338]  So if you love Young Jeopardy products like I do, InfoWarsTeam.com as well is the key site for that.
[00:43:53.398 --> 00:43:57.080]  But this is just, I keep saying historical time.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.102]  And everybody overuses the word, you know, epic.
[00:44:00.894 --> 00:44:02.956]  People overuse the word saying it's like Hitler.
[00:44:03.416 --> 00:44:08.921]  Well, Trump finally came out and said the media and the agencies are acting like Hitler.
[00:44:09.341 --> 00:44:13.284]  Yeah, Hitler overthrew governments, Hitler did corrupt things, Hitler lied about people.
[00:44:13.644 --> 00:44:20.290]  This is very Hitlerian, all the surveillance, all the tyranny, all the corruption, all the spies, all the manipulations.
[00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:21.531]  It's very authoritarian.
[00:44:21.831 --> 00:44:29.297]  And David, you made a really good central point yesterday, and I'm going to hand the baton to you and just ask you what else we can do, but you were making the point that you hope Trump
[00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:39.461]  He's learning about the surveillance state, because the one area he's been bad at, and his heart, he means well, he's very smart, he's a good guy, he believes, well, if the government's good, then the surveillance is okay.
[00:44:39.521 --> 00:44:39.681]  No.
[00:44:40.101 --> 00:44:41.823]  It's always used against innocent people.
[00:44:42.224 --> 00:44:43.505]  It's a Pandora's box.
[00:44:43.866 --> 00:44:46.409]  We need to get back to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, for a reason.
[00:44:46.789 --> 00:44:50.534]  We need to get back to not, as you said, Obama, as he leaves, he's changing laws.
[00:44:51.054 --> 00:44:51.715]  We're good to go.
[00:45:20.874 --> 00:45:22.996]  Thank you, Alex, and that truly is my hope.
[00:45:23.116 --> 00:45:26.219]  And Donald Trump is a smart guy.
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:31.104]  And unlike these other people, he's not controlled by these cabals.
[00:45:31.164 --> 00:45:32.045]  He's his own man.
[00:45:32.545 --> 00:45:37.169]  And so I truly believe that if, as he sees these types of things happening to him,
[00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:41.153]  And as he hears other people, he can change his mind on issues.
[00:45:41.213 --> 00:45:42.594]  I mean, he is open to things like that.
[00:45:42.634 --> 00:45:47.277]  That's why we see the situation that we saw with RFK Jr.
[00:45:47.397 --> 00:45:54.943]  crossing the lines of party lines and saying, hey, I'll work with Donald Trump against the CDC's abuses.
[00:45:55.284 --> 00:46:01.889]  And of course, we just have this article today about Allison Young, USA Today, pointing out how the CDC is keeping secret
[00:46:02.449 --> 00:46:04.470]  All of it's mishaps with deadly germs.
[00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:06.151]  So it's not just vaccines, it's these other things.
[00:46:06.171 --> 00:46:11.595]  We have these quasi-governmental organizations like the Federal Reserve, like the CDC.
[00:46:11.615 --> 00:46:12.415]  They need to be audited.
[00:46:12.435 --> 00:46:14.016]  The CDC needs to be audited as well.
[00:46:14.337 --> 00:46:16.078]  But when we see people like RFK Jr.
[00:46:16.138 --> 00:46:21.281]  come across, and we got the article up on Infowars.com, Bernie Sanders say, hey, I agree with Donald Trump.
[00:46:21.321 --> 00:46:23.923]  I'd like to change the infrastructure as long as we make sure that we don't...
[00:46:24.648 --> 00:46:28.989]  Give it all away to private companies, as long as we don't privatize the infrastructure.
[00:46:29.029 --> 00:46:31.750]  I'd like to work with them on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, too.
[00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:37.292]  So, we have people that we have profound disagreements with, like RFK Jr.
[00:46:37.832 --> 00:46:39.773]  and Bernie Sanders on many issues.
[00:46:39.793 --> 00:46:40.673]  We have profound agreements.
[00:46:40.733 --> 00:46:47.615]  But I think the key thing that Donald Trump can do, and we've already seen him do this, and we can see it, I think, to some extent in the confirmation hearings,
[00:46:48.076 --> 00:46:51.345]  Is that he doesn't have unilateral agreement with everybody on everything.
[00:46:51.385 --> 00:46:55.557]  He doesn't demand that people come in and agree with him on everything and be yes men.
[00:46:56.289 --> 00:47:03.395]  And so I think it's important that we look at these confirmation hearings and we see what people are saying, and we understand also that he's going to remain in charge.
[00:47:03.435 --> 00:47:04.155]  At least that's what we hope.
[00:47:04.476 --> 00:47:06.217]  We hope that it doesn't turn around the other way.
[00:47:06.257 --> 00:47:12.903]  That's why we're concerned when we see certain people that are in the cabinet that say, well, we're going in this way, and Donald Trump has been saying, no, I'm going in the other way.
[00:47:13.283 --> 00:47:16.746]  We always hope that the, you know, we're going to wait and see which way the influence goes.
[00:47:16.786 --> 00:47:17.867]  But I think he's a strong leader.
[00:47:17.887 --> 00:47:21.149]  I think he will do the right thing if these people go in a different direction.
[00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:25.693]  And before I get to some of this other news, I've got to say one of the things that Alex mentioned.
[00:47:26.664 --> 00:47:29.247]  About Joe Biden getting the Medal of Freedom and crying about it.
[00:47:30.268 --> 00:47:32.550]  That's something that really bothered me to see that.
[00:47:33.331 --> 00:47:37.294]  Not the fact that he's crying, not the fact that he's getting sentimental about his son's death.
[00:47:37.334 --> 00:47:38.516]  I think that had a lot to do with it.
[00:47:39.196 --> 00:47:40.417]  Because that was mentioned by Obama.
[00:47:41.704 --> 00:47:49.949]  My remembrance of Joe Biden is before he got the hair transplants, before he became Vice President, I remember the Clarence Thomas hearings.
[00:47:50.129 --> 00:47:53.611]  The same type of stuff that we're seeing now going on with the Cabinet.
[00:47:53.891 --> 00:48:01.476]  My wife and I were on vacation at the time, we were listening to them in the radio as they were being broadcast live, and I remember Joe Biden
[00:48:02.396 --> 00:48:11.582]  Railing against Clarence Thomas because Clarence Thomas had supported the concept of natural rights, and by extension, natural law.
[00:48:11.783 --> 00:48:13.964]  In other words, our rights come from God.
[00:48:14.064 --> 00:48:15.625]  They're not granted by government.
[00:48:15.685 --> 00:48:20.549]  Government is there to protect the rights that we have inherently as human beings.
[00:48:20.929 --> 00:48:22.530]  That's the Declaration of Independence.
[00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:29.455]  And I could not believe that Joe Biden was absolutely incensed by the fact that Clarence Thomas would support that.
[00:48:29.835 --> 00:48:43.512]  He felt that Clarence Thomas, supporting the principles embodied in the Declaration of Independence by Jefferson and the signers, he thought that those fundamental American principles of natural rights and natural law were disqualifying for Clarence Thomas.
[00:48:43.552 --> 00:48:44.333]  Can you believe that?
[00:48:45.282 --> 00:48:48.043]  I mean, go back and take a look at what he said in those hearings.
[00:48:48.323 --> 00:48:49.324]  Absolutely amazing!
[00:48:49.664 --> 00:48:54.126]  And here's the guy that Barack Obama gives a Presidential Medal of Freedom.
[00:48:54.586 --> 00:48:55.586]  He doesn't support freedom.
[00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:57.307]  He doesn't support individual rights.
[00:48:57.527 --> 00:49:00.208]  He doesn't support liberty in any way, shape, or form.
[00:49:00.688 --> 00:49:02.909]  Now, later in the program, we're going to be talking to Craig Richardson.
[00:49:02.929 --> 00:49:05.490]  He's the President of Energy and Environment Legal.
[00:49:06.231 --> 00:49:12.193]  And we see this explosion of regulations that are coming from Obama, especially in the last days.
[00:49:12.453 --> 00:49:13.794]  Especially through the EPA.
[00:49:14.639 --> 00:49:21.262]  The EPA, it doesn't say, for the last two days, the EPA has gone after yet another major car company.
[00:49:21.282 --> 00:49:25.703]  We had three days ago, they arrested a VW executive.
[00:49:26.544 --> 00:49:28.464]  And I would say basically they kidnapped him.
[00:49:29.085 --> 00:49:33.947]  But then the next day, yesterday, they came after Chrysler, Chrysler's stock tank.
[00:49:33.967 --> 00:49:36.187]  They said, you cheated on diesel.
[00:49:36.608 --> 00:49:38.188]  The same thing they came after VW with.
[00:49:38.508 --> 00:49:42.870]  Now today they're coming after Renault and saying, Renault, you cheated on your diesels.
[00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:43.870]  Do you see a pattern here?
[00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:51.692]  They want to shut down diesel engines, they want to shut down internal combustion engines, and that's a globalist tactic, just like the way they're coming after coal.
[00:49:51.712 --> 00:50:06.957]  So we're going to talk to Craig Richardson about that, and of course in the next hour we're going to be joined by Michael Snyder, a frequent contributor to Infowars.com, about the anarchists that are hoping to turn Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20th into one of the biggest riots in U.S.
[00:50:06.977 --> 00:50:07.217]  history.
[00:50:07.257 --> 00:50:07.917]  That's his article.
[00:50:08.217 --> 00:50:10.958]  Also asking, why is Obama moving troops into Poland?
[00:50:11.218 --> 00:50:13.999]  And provoking a war with Russia right before the inauguration.
[00:50:14.019 --> 00:50:19.320]  So he's doing a lot of things, and he's hoping that Donald Trump will not be able to turn these back.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:31.024]  He's hoping that they can do these things, put them in in terms of provocative Cold War actions, and that he can tie Donald Trump's hands by saying, you are a Russian agent.
[00:50:31.064 --> 00:50:34.285]  So they're doing everything that they can to make that come true.
[00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:40.449]  Today we've got the Washington Post saying some people are calling Donald Trump a Manchurian candidate.
[00:50:40.489 --> 00:50:41.710]  Notice how cleverly they do that?
[00:50:42.011 --> 00:50:44.052]  They don't say, we think he's a Manchurian candidate.
[00:50:44.092 --> 00:50:46.754]  They imply that he's a Manchurian candidate.
[00:50:47.075 --> 00:50:48.016]  And we're coming back from the break.
[00:50:48.036 --> 00:50:51.719]  I'm going to tell you who the real Manchurian candidate was and is.
[00:50:52.379 --> 00:50:52.619]  Okay?
[00:50:52.639 --> 00:50:54.401]  It's not Donald Trump.
[00:50:54.701 --> 00:50:55.642]  Yeah, you guessed it.
[00:50:56.322 --> 00:50:57.423]  His name starts with a no.
[00:50:57.543 --> 00:50:58.144]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:10.894 --> 00:51:12.114]  Wars are not cheap.
[00:51:12.855 --> 00:51:16.736]  And a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[00:51:17.396 --> 00:51:20.177]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[00:51:20.757 --> 00:51:21.757]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[00:51:21.918 --> 00:51:23.258]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[00:51:23.878 --> 00:51:30.680]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:35.362]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[00:51:35.982 --> 00:51:45.105]  That's why on major third party sites we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[00:51:46.025 --> 00:51:57.709]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically and try to free this republic and the world.
[00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:59.630]  We apply to the prize we bring.
[00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:07.058]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[00:52:07.678 --> 00:52:12.023]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[00:52:12.043 --> 00:52:13.305]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[00:52:13.325 --> 00:52:15.807]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've
[00:52:16.288 --> 00:52:16.788]  We're good to go.
[00:52:34.406 --> 00:52:35.646]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[00:52:36.087 --> 00:52:37.047]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[00:52:37.067 --> 00:52:38.707]  I dedicated myself to working out.
[00:52:38.727 --> 00:52:39.348]  I was in great shape.
[00:52:39.368 --> 00:52:40.448]  I'm dedicated to fighting the Globeless.
[00:52:40.468 --> 00:52:45.570]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:47.350]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:49.971]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[00:52:50.151 --> 00:52:54.913]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[00:52:55.513 --> 00:53:05.285]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[00:53:05.305 --> 00:53:06.126]  170-plus studies.
[00:53:06.166 --> 00:53:07.147]  We can make claims on this.
[00:53:07.167 --> 00:53:13.234]  This thing is like the Holy Grail, basically, of nerve regrowth, detoxification, antioxidant.
[00:53:14.015 --> 00:53:15.818]  I've got this at my fingertips at cost.
[00:53:15.898 --> 00:53:16.679]  I forget to take it.
[00:53:16.699 --> 00:53:17.621]  I forget to give it to my kids.
[00:53:17.681 --> 00:53:19.523]  I forget to, you know, push it on my parents.
[00:53:19.604 --> 00:53:21.787]  This is God's gift to us through nature.
[00:53:22.247 --> 00:53:22.808]  Well, guess what?
[00:53:22.848 --> 00:53:24.110]  DNA Force is coming back in.
[00:53:24.471 --> 00:53:25.071]  It's discounted.
[00:53:25.332 --> 00:53:28.356]  Now, in the next few weeks, a lot of these products that have sold out are coming back in.
[00:53:28.376 --> 00:53:29.798]  A lot of the products we have left
[00:53:30.339 --> 00:53:35.083]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[00:53:35.463 --> 00:53:40.207]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.
[00:53:40.567 --> 00:53:42.388]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.
[00:53:43.089 --> 00:53:44.910]  Secret 12, 20% off.
[00:53:45.071 --> 00:53:46.231]  Liver Shield, 20% off.
[00:53:46.452 --> 00:53:48.093]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:53:48.413 --> 00:53:51.456]  Knockout, the amazing sleep aid, I love taking it every day, 20% off.
[00:53:51.716 --> 00:53:52.957]  Prostagard, 20% off.
[00:53:53.277 --> 00:53:55.138]  And many others at Infowarslife.com.
[00:53:56.019 --> 00:53:59.545]  You are literally energizing this operation against the globalists.
[00:53:59.565 --> 00:54:08.040]  So I want to, again, salute you all and ask you to go check out the amazing specials we've got running right now for 2017 in the month of January.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.322]  Make our bodies great again.
[00:54:18.228 --> 00:54:19.429]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:19.469 --> 00:54:20.549]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:23.571]  I want to go back and talk about the real Manchurian candidate.
[00:54:23.831 --> 00:54:30.516]  Washington Post is implying that Trump is, very strongly implying, and they say, let us tell you what this metaphor is about.
[00:54:31.476 --> 00:54:36.419]  And so we're going to talk about that article, you know, because you have all these different movies that have come up that have become metaphors.
[00:54:36.499 --> 00:54:39.881]  Movies like Gaslight, we're talking about Gaslighting, or Kitsch 22.
[00:54:39.981 --> 00:54:42.943]  And they say, well, Manchurian candidate, you know, that's a metaphor as well.
[00:54:42.983 --> 00:54:43.924]  Let's explain that.
[00:54:45.131 --> 00:54:50.703]  Not directly attacking Trump, but in a very passive, aggressive way, is what the Washington Post is doing.
[00:54:50.723 --> 00:54:53.269]  The same way that CNN came after him earlier this week.
[00:54:53.289 --> 00:54:55.193]  So we're going to talk about that in just a moment, real quickly.
[00:54:56.169 --> 00:54:58.009]  Alex is talking about the specials that we have.
[00:54:58.089 --> 00:55:02.030]  It's very important at the beginning of the year, I think, to establish new habits.
[00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:03.610]  It's one of the ways that we can improve our lives.
[00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:06.631]  Everybody's looking to try to make themselves healthier as the new year begins.
[00:55:06.711 --> 00:55:08.671]  One of the ways you do that is by establishing habits.
[00:55:08.691 --> 00:55:22.314]  You know, one of the things I've noticed when I had a little bit more time than usual, I would kind of see a dip in my energy level over the weekends because on the weekends I wasn't taking the supplements from InfoWars I typically take.
[00:55:22.873 --> 00:55:26.115]  Things like Supermail Vitality or Survival Shield X2 and Ace of Nine-Nine.
[00:55:26.155 --> 00:55:29.356]  I have a routine, a habit, that I do that on weekdays.
[00:55:29.916 --> 00:55:35.039]  And I would get involved with other things I didn't have that habit on weekends, and I could notice a difference.
[00:55:35.079 --> 00:55:39.461]  I don't notice a difference on most of the things when I take them right away, except for things like brain force.
[00:55:39.921 --> 00:55:43.743]  That focuses my thoughts, so I definitely notice it with that, but the other ones...
[00:55:44.443 --> 00:55:50.167]  I didn't notice it until a couple of days went by without taking them and then I could really notice a difference.
[00:55:50.527 --> 00:55:51.868]  So you need to set up your habit.
[00:55:52.289 --> 00:55:56.171]  You need to get yourself on auto ship because we do have products that go out of stock occasionally.
[00:55:56.191 --> 00:56:00.394]  We just had DNA Force go out of stock for over a month.
[00:56:00.754 --> 00:56:08.200]  We've gotten that back in an emergency limited supply and we have offered it as 10% off to help you stock back up.
[00:56:09.139 --> 00:56:09.620]  All the time.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:13.223]  We offer 10% off if you set up AutoShip.
[00:56:13.723 --> 00:56:18.727]  And if your orders total more than $50 or more, then you get free shipping when you set up AutoShip.
[00:56:18.747 --> 00:56:20.369]  But right now, we also have some specials.
[00:56:21.189 --> 00:56:23.031]  30% off BrainForce, I just mentioned.
[00:56:23.051 --> 00:56:25.513]  30% off Survival Shield X2 Nascent I9, I just mentioned.
[00:56:25.873 --> 00:56:27.194]  Also, Supermail Vitality, 30% off.
[00:56:28.732 --> 00:56:43.685]  We have 20% off Secret 12, that's our vitamin B12 liquid formulation, 20% off of that, 20% off Liver Shield and Knockout, which is our natural sleep aid, Prostagard, 20% off, and many others at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:56:43.705 --> 00:56:44.746]  We appreciate your support.
[00:56:44.846 --> 00:56:46.307]  That is the way we fund our operation.
[00:56:46.347 --> 00:56:55.695]  Media Matters and others are funded by the government, by George Soros and so forth, and we're going to be talking to Michael Snyder in the next segment about the people behind this effort
[00:56:56.155 --> 00:56:59.937]  To try to create riots, to try to establish martial law.
[00:56:59.957 --> 00:57:05.119]  That's been a tactic of terrorists for a long time, to try to provoke an overstep of the government.
[00:57:05.159 --> 00:57:06.759]  But of course, she's calling for martial law.
[00:57:06.799 --> 00:57:10.461]  I was really kind of surprised that Rosie O'Donnell could even spell it the right way.
[00:57:11.181 --> 00:57:16.243]  Maybe she doesn't really realize, let's be charitable and say she doesn't really realize what she's truly calling for.
[00:57:17.084 --> 00:57:19.825]  Because that is truly a serious thing to call for that.
[00:57:19.865 --> 00:57:24.987]  But let's go back to this Manchurian candidate, this slander that Washington Post is putting out there.
[00:57:25.327 --> 00:57:27.588]  They're saying, well, you know, a lot of people have said this.
[00:57:28.008 --> 00:57:29.948]  Max Boot said it in the New York Times.
[00:57:30.088 --> 00:57:35.090]  Max Boot, the perennial never-Trumper, another partisan hack.
[00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:36.810]  That's where these things are always coming from.
[00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:42.272]  You know, they've called Donald Trump Hitler so many times, it's become a meme.
[00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:47.673]  Everybody from Glenn Beck to these people, the Washington Post, calling him Hitler.
[00:57:48.173 --> 00:57:50.294]  And you notice the other day how indignant they got.
[00:57:50.865 --> 00:58:01.275]  They even had the Anne Frank Museum call out Donald Trump saying, you said these people were acting like Nazis, creating fake information and putting it out there to assassinate your character.
[00:58:01.295 --> 00:58:04.719]  You know, he said that's the type of thing that Nazis did and have done.
[00:58:05.714 --> 00:58:10.417]  And I said, you can't invoke the Nazis because then that minimizes the Holocaust.
[00:58:10.437 --> 00:58:11.758]  That's what the Anne Frank people said.
[00:58:12.118 --> 00:58:19.563]  But it was okay when they did it ad nauseam, over and over again, ad infinitum, okay, against Donald Trump.
[00:58:19.603 --> 00:58:22.905]  Now they've got a new one because that's getting old, the Manchurian candidate.
[00:58:23.365 --> 00:58:26.507]  You know, the real Manchurian candidate is the guy who had multiple names.
[00:58:26.927 --> 00:58:29.488]  The guy who did everything he could to seal his record.
[00:58:29.568 --> 00:58:33.370]  The guy who traveled to Pakistan for a while and returned with a new Muslim name.
[00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:36.411]  The guy who grew up and was schooled in Islamic Indonesia.
[00:58:36.451 --> 00:58:42.614]  The guy who tried to cover up Christian symbols as one of the first speeches that he had when he was inaugurated.
[00:58:42.674 --> 00:58:45.776]  The guy who, when you saw his birth certificate, you saw it was a forgery.
[00:58:46.056 --> 00:58:48.177]  That Manchurian candidate, Barack Obama.
[00:58:48.197 --> 00:58:49.177]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:58:50.778 --> 00:58:52.499]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:54.289 --> 00:59:00.130]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[01:00:02.105 --> 01:00:08.007]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.436 --> 01:00:24.176]  Big Brother.
[01:00:24.556 --> 01:00:25.797]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:26.357 --> 01:00:27.458]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:28.298 --> 01:00:29.678]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:29.979 --> 01:00:31.099]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:31.619 --> 01:00:36.321]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:41.251]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:41.932]  I'm David Knight.
[01:00:42.012 --> 01:00:51.359]  As we were talking about the Washington Post's efforts to come up with a new pejorative term, a meme that they can throw at Donald Trump now.
[01:00:51.619 --> 01:01:00.406]  I guess the Hitler thing is getting so old, so tired, they're now going to call him the Manchurian candidate, implying that he is associated with Russia.
[01:01:00.546 --> 01:01:02.027]  And as I pointed out, the real guy
[01:01:02.768 --> 01:01:03.729]  That you have to be worried about.
[01:01:03.749 --> 01:01:11.612]  Being a foreign agent is the one with the secret identities, the multiple names, the hidden past, the forged birth certificate.
[01:01:11.632 --> 01:01:13.994]  We don't know where this guy came from, Barack Obama.
[01:01:14.514 --> 01:01:15.074]  We still don't know.
[01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:27.981]  That birth certificate is an absolute phony, and if you haven't seen the report that Darren McBrain put together with the people that worked on this with Sheriff Arpaio, you need to see that.
[01:01:28.461 --> 01:01:30.582]  That is a definitive collection of that.
[01:01:30.962 --> 01:01:35.968]  But they're continuing on with this, you know, he's a foreign agent tact.
[01:01:36.268 --> 01:01:39.472]  We've got Politico, of course, always opposing Donald Trump.
[01:01:39.832 --> 01:01:42.456]  Now talking about Pravda on the checkout line.
[01:01:42.676 --> 01:01:43.857]  Say Pravda on the checkout.
[01:01:44.057 --> 01:01:45.799]  Now talking about propaganda, fake news.
[01:01:45.819 --> 01:01:49.063]  Now we're going to call the National Enquirer Pravda.
[01:01:50.157 --> 01:01:52.820]  And they go in and they say, this is kind of interesting.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:02:00.466]  They say, back in 1987, the Enquirer helped to scuttle Gary Hart's presidential ambitions when it published a cover photo of Donna Rice sitting on his lap.
[01:02:01.127 --> 01:02:06.632]  And in a 2008 series, it threw a saddle on John Edwards' presidential bid and rode it into the ground.
[01:02:07.333 --> 01:02:09.935]  But the tabloid's thrust has always been pure scandal.
[01:02:11.136 --> 01:02:15.100]  And really, you know, what they did, yeah, it was a character issue, wasn't it?
[01:02:15.851 --> 01:02:19.972]  But it paled compared to what Hillary Clinton did.
[01:02:20.373 --> 01:02:38.779]  And yet, their idea is that somehow, what the National Enquirer did, by routinely, as they point out, depicting Clinton as crazed, diseased, near-death, an ISIS-supporting traitor, a liar, a blackmailer, corrupt, and a member of a crime family, all of the above, guilty!
[01:02:41.406 --> 01:02:42.266]  Is that no scandal?
[01:02:42.767 --> 01:02:43.607]  That's not a scandal?
[01:02:43.807 --> 01:02:57.577]  They say that, you know, these guys having extramarital affairs, and of course it was a big issue with John Edwards because his wife was very well respected in liberal circles and she had breast cancer, was dying of breast cancer, and here he is cheating on her.
[01:02:58.117 --> 01:03:01.419]  That was a big deal, big character issue, and that really hurt him.
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:08.865]  And yet, those things are personal character issues, but look at how broad the problems with Hillary Clinton are, and yet they're saying,
[01:03:10.183 --> 01:03:12.466]  They're not focusing on scandal here.
[01:03:12.766 --> 01:03:13.927]  Don't you think that's scandalous?
[01:03:14.387 --> 01:03:18.692]  I mean, violating national security, that's not a scandal to Politico.
[01:03:19.613 --> 01:03:22.596]  That's not something that National Enquirer should be reporting about.
[01:03:23.016 --> 01:03:25.338]  And they do the same sort of thing with Wikileaks.
[01:03:26.059 --> 01:03:30.764]  They attack them instead of attacking the information that they put out.
[01:03:31.684 --> 01:03:38.810]  They never said that anything that WikiLeaks gave us about Hillary Clinton, regardless of the source, they never said that any of that stuff was false.
[01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:45.975]  And now they're not saying, they don't make an argument that the National Enquirer reporting on Hillary Clinton was false.
[01:03:46.336 --> 01:03:48.497]  That stuff is true, folks.
[01:03:49.218 --> 01:03:50.319]  That's why she lost the election.
[01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:55.466]  You can't get your head around it, but you're going to continue on with this Trump is a foreign agent.
[01:03:55.606 --> 01:03:59.390]  That's a key part of all of this to try to destroy him.
[01:03:59.491 --> 01:04:08.241]  At the same time, we see a communist Chinese dictator about to speak at Davos, and they're bragging about the fact that he is going to be selling globalism.
[01:04:09.073 --> 01:04:10.393]  Do you see an irony in that?
[01:04:10.994 --> 01:04:36.842]  Do you see an irony with the fact that the most hyper-nationalistic, the most hegemonic country on earth, yeah they're a company, they have the most closed market, they violate copyright, left and right, they're the most notorious copyright pirates, that was what these trade agreements are supposed to shut down, they're currency manipulators, and yet they are champions of open trade globalism?
[01:04:38.086 --> 01:04:39.948]  You realize how we're being had here, don't you?
[01:04:40.449 --> 01:04:52.783]  You realize the phoniness of the Chinese coming out and saying that populism, protectionism, nativism, the world has come to a historic crossroad where one road leads to war, poverty and confrontation and domination.
[01:04:53.308 --> 01:04:54.950]  Now that's coming from the Chinese.
[01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:56.512]  They're the most aggressive of anybody.
[01:04:56.752 --> 01:04:59.535]  Yet we're told it's the Russians we have to worry about.
[01:04:59.795 --> 01:05:00.456]  Not ISIS.
[01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:02.358]  Did the Russians cut off anybody's heads?
[01:05:02.839 --> 01:05:03.479]  I don't think so.
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:08.926]  Can't we try to work with them on common ground just like we do JFK, RFK Jr.? ?
[01:05:14.352 --> 01:05:19.535]  He's a world-renowned systems scientist, he's an inventor, he's an entrepreneur.
[01:05:19.856 --> 01:05:22.978]  As a 14-year-old, he invented email.
[01:05:24.118 --> 01:05:28.321]  And Hillary Clinton wishes that he never existed at this point, I think.
[01:05:28.661 --> 01:05:35.966]  Tell us about this article, Buy Fresh, Buy GMO, and how that alerted you to the dangers that were being sold to us by academia.
[01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:37.949]  Yeah, I think.
[01:05:38.429 --> 01:05:40.030]  Great observation, by the way, David.
[01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:55.763]  So, you know, when I saw that article by FreshBiGym, you have to understand between 2003 and 2007, I went back to MIT to do my PhD to really create this new technology called Cytosol, which would help us really model very complex molecular pathways using the computer.
[01:05:56.613 --> 01:05:59.936]  So in 2014, when I saw that, frankly, it was an ad.
[01:06:00.036 --> 01:06:03.118]  This is MIT's Technology Review and it was an ad for GMOs.
[01:06:03.699 --> 01:06:23.315]  And as you read through that article, what you find is that there's this false narrative being created that the developing nations, for example, like Africa, India, we all must have GMOs because without GMOs, there's no way we're going to be able to produce enough food to feed the masses of the world.
[01:06:23.555 --> 01:06:25.737]  This is sort of this narrative that goes on.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:32.586]  By the way, you know, Henry Kissinger pointed out that if you really want to control people, it's not through oil, but control their soil.
[01:06:33.187 --> 01:06:33.447]  Yes.
[01:06:33.668 --> 01:06:40.115]  So MIT as a part of this, you know, voice was really essentially advertising GMOs.
[01:06:40.775 --> 01:06:43.959]  Now to the audience out there, to your point, David, it's a very important point.
[01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:45.180]  A GMO
[01:06:46.261 --> 01:06:46.501]  We're good.
[01:07:06.813 --> 01:07:16.858]  Basically these bogus scientists who are trying to convince all of us, oh don't worry, genetic engineering or GMOs is no different than plant breeding or normal breeding that takes place in nature.
[01:07:17.338 --> 01:07:22.801]  In normal breeding you have a full interaction of all the DNA, not just one little gene.
[01:07:23.781 --> 01:07:25.862]  So this is sort of the big lie that got promoted.
[01:07:25.882 --> 01:07:30.585]  Don't worry, you know, genetic GMOs are no different than full-blown breeding.
[01:07:30.605 --> 01:07:38.811]  But the reality is, what occurs with a GMO by taking a gene from one species and putting it into another, in a test tube, doesn't occur in nature.
[01:07:38.871 --> 01:07:48.777]  One of the ways that you can control the narrative, and we saw this when there were only a few networks out there, just you're talking about we had a parallel structure in the peer-reviewed journals.
[01:07:48.917 --> 01:07:50.258]  You've just got a few publishers
[01:07:50.778 --> 01:07:55.742]  And what they choose to report and what they choose not to report can be a form of censorship.
[01:07:55.802 --> 01:08:02.086]  And so you're able to transcend that by going open source, going directly to the public, but still having it be peer-reviewed.
[01:08:02.587 --> 01:08:07.851]  This whole assumption is based on the average person is stupid and we're going to tell you what you should even read.
[01:08:21.542 --> 01:08:23.704]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:24.045 --> 01:08:29.510]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:08:40.299 --> 01:08:43.443]  Well, Obama has been a very, very busy person.
[01:08:43.503 --> 01:08:51.372]  He's sending masses of troops to the Russian-Polish border with seven days left, a major provocation.
[01:08:51.392 --> 01:08:54.395]  They've put new sanctions in against Russia.
[01:08:55.116 --> 01:08:59.001]  There have been clear cyber attacks against independent media here in the United States.
[01:08:59.681 --> 01:09:03.003]  He's ended his wet foot, dry foot policy.
[01:09:03.063 --> 01:09:04.823]  Cuban migrants reaching U.S.
[01:09:04.863 --> 01:09:07.084]  soil were allowed to stay previously.
[01:09:07.144 --> 01:09:10.966]  Now they're the only group that basically can't seek political asylum.
[01:09:11.666 --> 01:09:16.048]  They just basically get sent back to the tyrant, to the tyrant's brother.
[01:09:16.568 --> 01:09:23.431]  They're in the Cuban liberty wonderland, similar to North Korea or Venezuela.
[01:09:24.352 --> 01:09:31.576]  But meanwhile, Biden is awarded the Medal of Freedom in a surprise ceremony brimming with emotion.
[01:09:31.636 --> 01:09:32.596]  Oh, lots of cheers.
[01:09:33.097 --> 01:09:39.460]  Obama presents VP, the nation's top civilian honor for the defense of liberty and freedom.
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:46.704]  Yeah, like his son, Biden's son, taking over the billions of dollars a year of natural gas coming out of Russia.
[01:09:47.916 --> 01:09:48.938]  Through Ukraine?
[01:09:48.958 --> 01:09:50.119]  That's a good family business.
[01:09:50.159 --> 01:10:01.113]  Just put your son over the energy company so he personally reportedly is going to make hundreds of millions of dollars off jacking up the gas prices, after they hijack it basically, into Europe.
[01:10:01.734 --> 01:10:03.296]  Yes, giving him an award.
[01:10:04.312 --> 01:10:20.878]  But the reason I'm popping in here during the transmission with David Knight and Mr. Schneider is I was thinking, you know, I've seen this meme put out by Dying MSM that I'm a Russian dupe and I'm a Russian idiot and I'm a moron.
[01:10:20.918 --> 01:10:25.740]  That's why I started my show 20 plus years ago before this controversy even existed the last year.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:31.603]  That's why I promote the Second Amendment and sovereignty and national borders and private property.
[01:10:32.743 --> 01:10:35.365]  The right to religion, everything that made our country great.
[01:10:35.485 --> 01:10:38.406]  Yes, it's all because I'm a dupe of Putin.
[01:10:38.466 --> 01:10:39.567]  I don't speak Russian.
[01:10:39.647 --> 01:10:40.727]  I've never been to Russia.
[01:10:40.767 --> 01:10:41.848]  I've been on Russian TV.
[01:10:41.908 --> 01:10:45.350]  I've been on Portuguese and Japanese and British TV.
[01:10:46.431 --> 01:10:50.052]  But it is true that the Russians have pulled out from the oligarchs, the same globalists.
[01:10:50.072 --> 01:10:52.714]  So we do have a kinship.
[01:10:52.794 --> 01:10:54.555]  We do have some solidarity there.
[01:10:54.615 --> 01:11:01.198]  But what an insult to say that we're all Manchurian candidates and that we're idiot dupes.
[01:11:02.512 --> 01:11:03.073]  of Putin.
[01:11:03.853 --> 01:11:05.735]  Let me explain what's happening here.
[01:11:05.815 --> 01:11:08.557]  We have foreign globalist powers that have hijacked this nation.
[01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:08.997]  We know that.
[01:11:09.798 --> 01:11:10.879]  We have to keep hammering that.
[01:11:11.239 --> 01:11:20.227]  And these multinationals want us to transfer our sovereignty to these unaccountable secret global boards like TPP and the WTO through deals like NAFTA and GATT.
[01:11:20.347 --> 01:11:20.907]  It's not happening.
[01:11:22.188 --> 01:11:28.213]  We are declaring our sovereignty, we're declaring our individual liberty, and we're not going to be ruled by far-off secret cabals.
[01:11:28.253 --> 01:11:28.574]  It's over.
[01:11:29.054 --> 01:11:31.196]  So we're the ones standing up against
[01:11:32.597 --> 01:11:33.498]  The foreign takeover.
[01:11:33.858 --> 01:11:39.241]  We're the ones standing up against the traitors and the people trying to sell us out to globalism, they're the enemy.
[01:11:40.282 --> 01:11:48.567]  So all of you that support globalism, you're the idiot dupes that want to be slaves and don't want to control your own destiny and have sold out to this system.
[01:11:49.448 --> 01:11:57.653]  But I do want to say that Donald Trump, Ron Paul, and many others deserve a medal of freedom.
[01:11:57.733 --> 01:11:58.974]  If we were going to hand these things out,
[01:12:00.026 --> 01:12:01.447]  But they're the type of men that don't want awards.
[01:12:01.507 --> 01:12:02.928]  They just want results and freedom.
[01:12:03.948 --> 01:12:11.933]  Because what's promoting peace and freedom worldwide is not having a needless new Cold War that costs trillions of dollars with Russia.
[01:12:13.154 --> 01:12:14.575]  That's what we're breaking down here.
[01:12:14.595 --> 01:12:15.575]  That's what we're pushing.
[01:12:16.115 --> 01:12:17.576]  That's what we're promoting.
[01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:23.440]  That's what as a country and a world we want is peace in our time.
[01:12:25.578 --> 01:12:31.122]  But taking a breath and settling down, the reason I get so upset is that we need to be upset.
[01:12:31.782 --> 01:12:33.043]  We need to get out of our comfort zone.
[01:12:33.063 --> 01:12:39.427]  We need to get out of our trances, get out of our hazes, get out of our daydreams and realize globalism is a nightmare.
[01:12:39.828 --> 01:12:43.970]  And only being awake is going to reverse that and gives us any chance of stopping it.
[01:12:44.010 --> 01:12:46.412]  And we've got a great chance of stopping it.
[01:12:47.272 --> 01:12:50.395]  But it is the people that have sold out to globalism that are the true traitors.
[01:12:50.455 --> 01:12:51.155]  And they know that.
[01:12:51.635 --> 01:12:55.058]  And that's why, again, they twist reality and turn it back on to us.
[01:12:56.358 --> 01:13:02.941]  But really, all of us that have been promoting peace and freedom, aren't we the people that deserve the awards?
[01:13:03.361 --> 01:13:05.182]  And again, I'm not saying I won an award.
[01:13:05.823 --> 01:13:14.686]  I'm saying it's asinine to see Obama being given awards and to see Biden being given awards.
[01:13:14.867 --> 01:13:17.888]  And it turns these awards into complete jokes.
[01:13:17.968 --> 01:13:19.829]  I mean, a Nobel Peace Prize.
[01:13:20.649 --> 01:13:22.372]  is the biggest joke in the world now.
[01:13:22.793 --> 01:13:31.367]  Even the committee last year admitted they had discredited themselves giving Obama a peace award with all these wars before he'd ever done anything, before he even got into office.
[01:13:32.088 --> 01:13:34.992]  And giving awards to Henry Kissinger and Al Gore.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:41.404]  It's all nothing but propaganda offensives to prop up their failing facade.
[01:13:41.424 --> 01:13:43.326]  And they need to understand, they're losing.
[01:13:43.686 --> 01:13:44.407]  They failed.
[01:13:45.148 --> 01:13:50.272]  They tried to play this game that Karl Rove talked about where they're history's actors and they control reality.
[01:13:50.813 --> 01:13:59.320]  And that only works for so long because when you don't deliver freedom and prosperity to the people, but you're telling them that's what they're getting, they're going to begin to see through your lies.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:03.024]  And at a certain point, they're not going to believe a word you say.
[01:14:04.226 --> 01:14:08.268]  You know, USA Today, in closing, has an article, Trump cabinet of disruptors ready to go.
[01:14:08.688 --> 01:14:10.810]  Nominees likely to lead agencies they battled.
[01:14:11.150 --> 01:14:13.571]  And they act like, oh, look how discredited Trump is.
[01:14:13.611 --> 01:14:14.251]  He's crazy.
[01:14:14.632 --> 01:14:16.333]  He's putting people in that will have gridlock.
[01:14:16.993 --> 01:14:19.034]  He's putting people in that will actually fight with folks.
[01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:20.795]  This is terrible.
[01:14:21.255 --> 01:14:23.857]  Yes, he put in people.
[01:14:23.897 --> 01:14:26.558]  He's putting in people that actually opposed globalism.
[01:14:26.578 --> 01:14:28.079]  That's what I told you about these nominees.
[01:14:28.099 --> 01:14:30.260]  It doesn't matter what big companies they came from.
[01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:33.262]  In those big companies, they battled globalism.
[01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:41.455]  And again, that's why the elite are panicking because look at how Trump's getting results out of the gates on Obamacare, you name it.
[01:14:41.875 --> 01:14:47.280]  And notice he said on Obamacare, I can leave this for the Democrats and have it destroy them, but it's going to hurt the American people.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.462]  So we're going to reverse it and repeal it now.
[01:14:49.482 --> 01:14:55.547]  And of course get criticized because no system's perfect, but we're going to do the best job we can because it's what we swore to do.
[01:14:56.676 --> 01:14:58.498]  Results, not theater.
[01:14:59.239 --> 01:15:01.461]  Reality, not fiction.
[01:15:02.101 --> 01:15:04.904]  There's a battle between fantasy land and the real world.
[01:15:05.945 --> 01:15:08.307]  And I want to be in the reality-based community.
[01:15:08.688 --> 01:15:12.451]  Now back to David Knight and Mr. Schneider at the InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[01:15:12.852 --> 01:15:13.753]  InfoWars.com.
[01:15:14.619 --> 01:15:19.841]  Thank you, Alex, and as you point out, these award ceremonies, they've got Obama's Medal of Freedom.
[01:15:19.881 --> 01:15:27.084]  It's about as phony and silly as the Golden Globes Awards that we just saw, put out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
[01:15:27.104 --> 01:15:37.689]  I guess this is the Medal of Freedom done by the Hollywood Foreign President Association that was given to Joe Biden, because everything about their ideas are foreign to America.
[01:15:37.729 --> 01:15:39.590]  As I pointed out in the last segment, Joe Biden
[01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:46.836]  Coming after Clarence Thomas saying you're not qualified to be a Supreme Court Justice because you believe in the idea of natural law and natural rights.
[01:15:46.856 --> 01:15:49.719]  It's like, wow, that's what this country was founded upon.
[01:15:50.199 --> 01:15:55.564]  So yeah, we got the Hollywood foreign president handing out his awards now about a week after the Golden Globes.
[01:15:55.584 --> 01:16:02.491]  Joining us now is Michael Snyder of the Economic Collapse Blog.com and of course he's a frequent contributor to InfoWars.com.
[01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:08.836]  Michael, I want to talk to you first about this article that Alex and I have been talking about earlier in the show.
[01:16:08.956 --> 01:16:14.241]  Of course, we had Rosie O'Donnell come out today and say, hey, let's have martial law to stop Donald Trump.
[01:16:14.301 --> 01:16:17.283]  Of course, you know, she's kind of a failed Hollywood actress.
[01:16:17.303 --> 01:16:27.632]  She has a lot of friends in New York and Hollywood, but she has been fired by Oprah Winfrey, as Donald Trump gleefully pointed out.
[01:16:27.992 --> 01:16:30.094]  But nevertheless, she's putting this out there.
[01:16:30.854 --> 01:16:33.936]  And it is precisely what we've seen George Soros doing.
[01:16:33.976 --> 01:16:51.969]  As you point out in your article that we had at Infowars.com on January the 10th, you pointed out we got people like Cornel West, we've got Bill Ayers, we've got Carl Dix of the Communist Party, they're all working to do the same sorts of things that we've seen George Soros organizing right after the election and even organizing in the run-up to the election.
[01:16:51.989 --> 01:16:59.434]  All the attacks at all the Donald Trump rallies, the Black Lives Matter, going to war with the police, going to war with
[01:16:59.794 --> 01:17:16.241]  White people, even going to war with other black people in Chicago, as we see as many people killed during the eight years of President Obama in Chicago, their gun-free zone, as were killed soldiers who died in Iraq and Afghanistan during the George W. Bush administration.
[01:17:16.261 --> 01:17:17.842]  About 4,000 in each of those cases.
[01:17:17.882 --> 01:17:24.185]  So, talk to us about your concerns about what the anarchists are trying to do in terms of promoting martial law.
[01:17:25.663 --> 01:17:30.224]  Yeah, thank you, David, and people need to realize that this starts tomorrow.
[01:17:30.644 --> 01:17:40.647]  The radical left, the election of Donald Trump was perhaps the single most galvanizing moment in the history of the radical left, certainly since the days of Ronald Reagan, where they didn't expect Donald Trump to win.
[01:17:40.667 --> 01:17:50.050]  They kind of treated him as a big joke, but now that they've won, they're fired up, they're ready for battle, they're ready for war, while many, many patriots, many conservatives have kind of gone to sleep.
[01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:53.032]  Many Trump supporters said, hey, he won, so now the battle's over.
[01:17:53.092 --> 01:17:54.653]  The truth is, the battle's just beginning.
[01:17:55.113 --> 01:18:06.241]  In fact, an organization known as refusefascism.org recently took out a full-page ad in the New York Times talking about how we need, must resist Donald Trump.
[01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:11.904]  And if you go to their official website, you'll see that there's a whole laundry list of activities.
[01:18:12.365 --> 01:18:16.347]  And, you know, we've heard about January 20th, how they plan to disrupt the inauguration.
[01:18:16.688 --> 01:18:19.970]  But it actually starts tomorrow, January 14th.
[01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:20.530]  I think?
[01:18:36.986 --> 01:18:38.186]  And that's another organization.
[01:18:38.206 --> 01:18:47.008]  There's multiple organizations all funded by the radical left, people like George Soros, all ultimately controlled and dominated by the globalists.
[01:18:47.128 --> 01:18:52.829]  But, you know, the people who are activists, they don't even realize necessarily where the money's coming from.
[01:18:52.969 --> 01:18:59.611]  All they know is they're being told that Donald Trump is Hitler, that he's the devil, that he must be resisted, basically to the left.
[01:19:00.231 --> 01:19:03.732]  Donald Trump is the personification of everything that's wrong with America.
[01:19:04.092 --> 01:19:09.413]  And so what they plan to do on Inauguration Day, they plan to disrupt the activities as much as possible.
[01:19:09.473 --> 01:19:11.854]  One of the big things they're planning are blockades.
[01:19:11.874 --> 01:19:16.935]  They're planning blockades of the major transportation routes into Washington D.C.
[01:19:17.295 --> 01:19:22.196]  and then the major transportation routes in and across the Inauguration Route.
[01:19:22.497 --> 01:19:24.277]  So they want to keep people from getting there.
[01:19:24.537 --> 01:19:33.942]  They want to get on the news because if there's a whole row of bodies across a major interstate or across a major parade route in Washington, D.C., that's going to get attention.
[01:19:33.982 --> 01:19:35.923]  That's going to get on the news, and that's what they want.
[01:19:36.263 --> 01:19:42.447]  So they say openly they want to force as much of the inauguration celebration as possible inside.
[01:19:42.727 --> 01:19:45.588]  They want to turn it into a riot, into chaos.
[01:19:45.888 --> 01:19:52.112]  They want to do whatever they can to disrupt things, to upset the proceedings, and to get attention for their cause.
[01:19:52.512 --> 01:19:56.476]  Yeah, of course, we're going to continue with Michael Schneider on the other side of the break.
[01:19:56.516 --> 01:20:03.623]  And of course, Michael, when they say they're going to create blockades, you know that's going to get violent with people just like they did at the Trump rallies.
[01:20:03.663 --> 01:20:05.946]  They aren't going to be content just to lay down in front.
[01:20:05.966 --> 01:20:06.887]  They're going to attack cars.
[01:20:06.907 --> 01:20:07.808]  They're going to attack people.
[01:20:08.048 --> 01:20:08.408]  Stay with us.
[01:20:08.428 --> 01:20:08.949]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:14.975 --> 01:20:24.520]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.361]  And so I get questions all the time over the years.
[01:20:28.142 --> 01:20:33.845]  Why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsStore.com or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[01:20:34.585 --> 01:20:35.225]  And it's simple.
[01:20:35.826 --> 01:20:40.928]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[01:20:41.388 --> 01:20:42.389]  And there's a nexus point.
[01:20:42.449 --> 01:20:45.250]  There's quality versus price.
[01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:47.191]  And those two points have to come together.
[01:20:47.791 --> 01:21:00.777]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor, has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[01:21:02.139 --> 01:21:04.220]  The true next generation in body armor.
[01:21:05.101 --> 01:21:12.085]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[01:21:12.885 --> 01:21:15.667]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[01:21:15.707 --> 01:21:18.108]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[01:21:18.148 --> 01:21:22.151]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[01:21:22.591 --> 01:21:23.392]  Well, believe me,
[01:21:24.492 --> 01:21:27.174]  This is disruptive to tyrants worldwide.
[01:21:27.695 --> 01:21:38.184]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[01:21:38.824 --> 01:21:40.446]  It's nanotube technology.
[01:21:41.026 --> 01:21:42.567]  It's created here in Texas.
[01:21:43.208 --> 01:21:50.254]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[01:21:50.994 --> 01:21:53.376]  We went out and did some testing.
[01:21:53.796 --> 01:21:56.138]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[01:21:56.158 --> 01:22:02.622]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible could be so strong.
[01:22:02.862 --> 01:22:16.151]  So what we did is we went out, we used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[01:22:16.491 --> 01:22:17.331]  Born in Texas.
[01:22:17.692 --> 01:22:18.592]  Made in America.
[01:22:18.852 --> 01:22:21.474]  Exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[01:22:21.554 --> 01:22:22.354]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:22:22.394 --> 01:22:23.314]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[01:22:23.715 --> 01:22:25.035]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[01:22:25.075 --> 01:22:25.716]  It's waterproof.
[01:22:25.736 --> 01:22:26.176]  You can wear it.
[01:22:26.216 --> 01:22:26.796]  It's comfortable.
[01:22:26.876 --> 01:22:27.597]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[01:22:27.617 --> 01:22:29.998]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[01:22:30.478 --> 01:22:38.082]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[01:22:38.783 --> 01:22:41.887]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[01:22:42.348 --> 01:22:49.278]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:50.660]  What did they really say about this?
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:51.661]  No, this is through the roof.
[01:22:51.842 --> 01:22:54.586]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[01:22:55.426 --> 01:22:59.210]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[01:22:59.310 --> 01:23:03.414]  Because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[01:23:03.894 --> 01:23:08.919]  So they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[01:23:09.019 --> 01:23:16.426]  And 90, I mean you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a mission or crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[01:23:16.466 --> 01:23:17.607]  This stops that unless it's a slug.
[01:23:18.107 --> 01:23:19.247]  I mean, that's amazing.
[01:23:19.287 --> 01:23:22.508]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[01:23:22.768 --> 01:23:24.048]  And soon, they won't have it.
[01:23:24.388 --> 01:23:28.769]  If it's available to civilians who are not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[01:23:28.949 --> 01:23:33.030]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[01:23:33.810 --> 01:23:37.171]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[01:23:37.191 --> 01:23:37.951]  People didn't believe in it.
[01:23:38.251 --> 01:23:39.271]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[01:23:39.331 --> 01:23:41.052]  I feed my horse hay.
[01:23:42.392 --> 01:23:44.473]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[01:23:47.788 --> 01:23:49.589]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[01:23:50.850 --> 01:23:52.752]  Again, fund the InfoWard.
[01:23:52.892 --> 01:23:56.795]  Get the game-changing nanotech tubes from Buck Rogers.
[01:23:57.296 --> 01:23:59.337]  It's a win-win.
[01:23:59.657 --> 01:23:59.337]  $200.
[01:23:59.898 --> 01:24:02.860]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWardStore.com.
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:03.641]  It's amazing.
[01:24:19.727 --> 01:24:20.968]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:20.988 --> 01:24:21.469]  I'm David Knight.
[01:24:21.489 --> 01:24:28.015]  We're talking to Michael Schneider of the Economic Collapse Blog.com, a frequent contributor here to InfoWars as well.
[01:24:28.035 --> 01:24:41.908]  We're talking about the run-up to the inauguration, and of course, in the run-up to the inauguration, we have people like Bill Ayers, people like Carl Dix of the Communist Party USA, as Michael Schneider just pointed out, and as he pointed out in his article, they're taking out ads in the New York Times.
[01:24:42.649 --> 01:24:47.591]  Saying that they're going to create a call to arms essentially to refuse fascism.
[01:24:47.671 --> 01:24:54.574]  The thing that we see repeatedly used over and over again by the communists is this type of rhetoric about fascism.
[01:24:54.894 --> 01:25:00.157]  And of course there's a lot of different types of fascism, but that is the way the communists see everything.
[01:25:00.177 --> 01:25:04.819]  They don't really kind of talk about a left-right paradigm, the false dichotomy that we're sold about left and right.
[01:25:04.859 --> 01:25:09.361]  That truly in and of itself is a false paradigm, but to them you're either with them
[01:25:09.781 --> 01:25:14.544]  with the communists or you are a fascist and so that's a very telltale thing there that we see.
[01:25:14.584 --> 01:25:15.825]  We're going to get back to Michael Snyder.
[01:25:15.845 --> 01:25:16.666]  We want to talk about that.
[01:25:17.086 --> 01:25:29.715]  Alex wanted to talk about how do we focus the attention to people's attention on this, the whole process to subvert the Trump presidency and also to try to create martial law with George Soros.
[01:25:29.775 --> 01:25:31.256]  How do we focus public attention on that?
[01:25:31.276 --> 01:25:33.498]  So we're going to ask that to Michael Snyder as well.
[01:25:33.538 --> 01:25:36.460]  And there's some other articles that he's put out recently about
[01:25:37.443 --> 01:25:45.308]  The provocations in Europe, as well as what's going on economically here at home as we see layoffs with Walmart, as we see layoffs with Boeing.
[01:25:45.808 --> 01:25:52.512]  We see jobs that people say are coming back, but certainly it's not the wonderful economy that Obama and others have been talking about.
[01:25:53.112 --> 01:26:10.030]  Before we do, real quickly, I just want to remind you, as we're talking about this kind of unrest, as we pointed out last week in the wake of the shooting, and actually it wasn't that we introduced the products at that point in time, Media Matters, George Soros' organization, criticized me for trying to profiteer, they said, off of the shooting.
[01:26:10.530 --> 01:26:11.111]  We're good to go.
[01:26:30.189 --> 01:26:38.674]  They can push for more disarmament of people, but we say, look, if they're not going to let you have your guns, you can at least try to protect yourself, protect your family, especially when you're traveling.
[01:26:38.814 --> 01:26:40.555]  This happened in the luggage area.
[01:26:40.855 --> 01:26:48.299]  This guy travels reportedly with the only luggage he had was his gun, that he traveled from Alaska to Fort Lauderdale to shoot the place up.
[01:26:48.339 --> 01:26:49.880]  That in and of itself is very suspicious.
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:52.481]  There's a lot of suspicious things in that shooting.
[01:26:53.582 --> 01:26:58.766]  If you were there, if you had the cheapest form of this body armor that we sell, is an insert.
[01:26:58.786 --> 01:26:59.227]  It's about $200.
[01:26:59.287 --> 01:27:02.549]  And with that insert, you can put that in your backpack.
[01:27:02.889 --> 01:27:05.612]  And you've at least got something that is going to stop a bullet.
[01:27:06.252 --> 01:27:09.395]  This is a patented form of carbon nanotube technology.
[01:27:09.415 --> 01:27:13.198]  It's the lightest, strongest, most flexible body armor on the market.
[01:27:13.238 --> 01:27:14.779]  This is a state-of-the-art stuff, folks.
[01:27:14.839 --> 01:27:15.860]  It's only a quarter inch thick.
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:19.422]  This field test is to stop the most powerful pistol rounds in production.
[01:27:19.482 --> 01:27:23.585]  It's waterproof, super lightweight, made in the USA, 20-year warranty.
[01:27:23.885 --> 01:27:30.449]  You will find it at TheInfoWarsStore.com, our exclusive line of tactical nanotechnology body armor.
[01:27:30.509 --> 01:27:38.995]  We go from that insert that you can put into a backpack all the way up to a full bulletproof vest that previously only law enforcement had.
[01:27:39.978 --> 01:27:46.380]  That's something you need to think about, especially when we look at the fact that these crazy communists want to try to start riots in every city.
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:50.281]  That's their preferred way to do political activism.
[01:27:50.301 --> 01:27:51.402]  They don't want to debate you.
[01:27:51.842 --> 01:27:56.843]  They want to either fight you, censor you, or shoot you in most of these cases.
[01:27:56.883 --> 01:27:58.804]  So let's go back to Michael Snyder.
[01:27:58.844 --> 01:28:08.347]  Michael, when we look at the way they're talking about fascism, that is a dead giveaway as to the origins and the political tactics of these people, isn't it?
[01:28:09.742 --> 01:28:12.745]  Oh, it absolutely is, because it's all coming from the same place.
[01:28:12.785 --> 01:28:19.931]  You know, George Soros has funded and organized revolutions all over the world, and they do the same things over and over and over again.
[01:28:20.072 --> 01:28:25.416]  And now they've been planning for a couple of months now for this big event in Washington, D.C.
[01:28:25.436 --> 01:28:30.001]  And as far as the radical left is concerned, the war starts tomorrow.
[01:28:30.521 --> 01:28:41.224]  And so from January 14th to January 20th, leading up to January 20th, they're going to have protests, they're going to have events, they're going to try to get as much attention on themselves as possible leading up to January 20th.
[01:28:41.264 --> 01:28:48.627]  Now, of course, they can't stop Donald Trump from being inaugurated, but what they want to do is they want to completely change the narrative of the day.
[01:28:48.667 --> 01:28:52.248]  If you remember past inaugurations, for example, when Barack Obama was inaugurated,
[01:28:52.608 --> 01:28:54.349]  It was a big celebration.
[01:28:54.389 --> 01:29:01.454]  You know, the whole nation came together and Barack Obama got out of the vehicle and walked the parade route and it was peaceful and people were cheering.
[01:29:01.874 --> 01:29:04.336]  They wanted to turn it into the exact opposite.
[01:29:04.936 --> 01:29:11.201]  Chaos and riots and they want to make sure Donald Trump maybe even doesn't even make it through the parade route.
[01:29:11.241 --> 01:29:15.864]  Now he's going to be inaugurated but what they want the news to show is chaos and
[01:29:16.024 --> 01:29:16.884]  We're good to go.
[01:29:41.414 --> 01:29:41.895]  Absolutely.
[01:29:41.915 --> 01:29:50.943]  They're going to go from a love fest that they had with the media and Barack Obama, they're going to go, look, the country is torn apart by the presidency of Donald Trump.
[01:29:51.063 --> 01:29:54.567]  The media is waiting for this, waiting to pounce on this.
[01:29:54.587 --> 01:29:58.791]  This is all being performed as a kind of a kabuki dance.
[01:29:58.831 --> 01:30:00.592]  We'll be right back with Michael Snyder.
[01:30:01.013 --> 01:30:02.614]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:03.555 --> 01:30:06.238]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:10.566 --> 01:30:22.015]  Yesterday, the Senate took the first step towards repealing the Affordable Care Act with a 51-48 vote on a new budget blueprint that would open the doors to gut and rid ourselves of the disaster that is Obamacare without allowing Democrats to filibuster.
[01:30:22.156 --> 01:30:34.966]  Liberal tears flowed heavy as the Senate had to be called in order every time a Democrat voted no, with a nice lecture to go with it, forcing the providing officer, Senator Cory Gardner, to slam his gavel and scold the Democrats, repeating ad nauseam, debate is not allowed during a vote.
[01:30:35.086 --> 01:30:38.047]  Now today, the vote moves on to the House, where we have had similar results.
[01:30:38.167 --> 01:30:48.152]  The debate has been heated, with Democrats speaking past their time, bringing in large, blown-up photos of children to win sympathy points, and trying to argue that Republicans are ending healthcare, like before the Affordable Care Act, right?
[01:30:48.292 --> 01:31:00.537]  Senator Hakeem Jeffries claims that voting against the Affordable Care Act sets up Americans to be screwed by bigwigs and fat cats in the healthcare industry, ignoring the fact that this is what the Affordable Care Act did, creating healthcare monopolies in some regions.
[01:31:00.697 --> 01:31:06.481]  He also said that Republicans had no plan, to which Republicans responded by showing the many plans they brought to the debate floor.
[01:31:06.581 --> 01:31:09.844]  This is Owen Schroer, and I've got jugs of liberal tears here.
[01:31:10.344 --> 01:31:14.748]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:31:14.828 --> 01:31:25.756]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:31:25.916 --> 01:31:30.838]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:31:30.958 --> 01:31:33.479]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:31:33.539 --> 01:31:35.039]  It helps detoxify.
[01:31:35.239 --> 01:31:38.100]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:31:38.140 --> 01:31:42.882]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:31:42.902 --> 01:31:49.144]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:31:49.184 --> 01:31:54.466]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:31:54.486 --> 01:31:55.246]  I'm taking it now.
[01:31:55.506 --> 01:31:56.006]  Every day.
[01:31:56.206 --> 01:31:56.927]  This is so key.
[01:31:57.187 --> 01:31:59.508]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[01:31:59.748 --> 01:32:01.489]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[01:32:01.509 --> 01:32:03.610]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[01:32:03.730 --> 01:32:09.452]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:10.393 --> 01:32:16.555]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[01:32:17.096 --> 01:32:19.737]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[01:32:20.157 --> 01:32:25.340]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:31.723]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[01:32:31.883 --> 01:32:35.025]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[01:32:35.165 --> 01:32:36.606]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[01:32:36.826 --> 01:32:40.970]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[01:32:41.150 --> 01:32:44.033]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[01:32:44.093 --> 01:32:45.674]  It works like an antioxidant.
[01:32:45.774 --> 01:32:48.957]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[01:32:49.237 --> 01:32:51.560]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:52.801]  It's in powder form.
[01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:55.603]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[01:32:55.783 --> 01:32:56.784]  I take this.
[01:32:56.924 --> 01:32:58.186]  This is the product that I take.
[01:32:58.306 --> 01:33:00.267]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[01:33:01.088 --> 01:33:01.868]  We fight the Globals.
[01:33:01.888 --> 01:33:02.749]  We fight the New World Order.

[01:33:12.492 --> 01:33:15.492]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:16.093 --> 01:33:20.234]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:27.748 --> 01:33:31.392]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight, and joining me now is Michael Schneider.
[01:33:31.432 --> 01:33:38.360]  We've been talking about his article, and of course, what is going to be happening in and around the inauguration.
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:39.361]  It's going to begin tomorrow.
[01:33:39.681 --> 01:33:49.652]  And of course, this is a program that's been put together by communist agitators, people like Bill Ayers, who hung out with Weatherman, people who've openly talked about revolution for a long time.
[01:33:51.058 --> 01:34:02.561]  Joining with George Soros as we've seen both before the inauguration before the election and then immediately after the election and now they're bringing this up to the inauguration talking about Rosie O'Donnell talking about martial law.
[01:34:02.581 --> 01:34:04.021]  This is a common recurring theme.
[01:34:04.041 --> 01:34:10.703]  We're going to talk about again some of the things that may be happening a little bit more and then we're going to move on to what's going on in Poland.
[01:34:10.743 --> 01:34:13.624]  We now have Obama moving troops into Poland.
[01:34:14.204 --> 01:34:17.045]  stationing them there permanently for the first time.
[01:34:17.326 --> 01:34:18.986]  These things are not unrelated.
[01:34:19.026 --> 01:34:32.293]  So we're going to pull these things together for you and show you how, even though in the past we used to have the people on the right would, rightly or wrongly, label people as communist sympathizers, now you're labeled as a Russian sympathizer.
[01:34:32.853 --> 01:34:36.375]  And this is being done by people who are communist sympathizers, like Bill Ayers.
[01:34:36.435 --> 01:34:41.958]  People who genuinely did want to provoke a communist revolution, and now that's what they're still trying to do.
[01:34:42.338 --> 01:34:43.319]  So we're going to talk about that.
[01:34:43.339 --> 01:34:51.366]  One of the things he mentions in his article here is how Michael Moore has announced that he plans to attend the Women's March on Washington.
[01:34:52.807 --> 01:34:53.848]  Is Michael Moore coming out?
[01:34:55.329 --> 01:34:55.709]  I don't know.
[01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:58.291]  Anyway, he's going to be there at the Women's March.
[01:34:59.272 --> 01:35:00.593]  He has made a call to arms.
[01:35:00.613 --> 01:35:04.336]  He says it's important for everybody to go there, he said on MSNBC.
[01:35:05.339 --> 01:35:08.460]  When we look at this, Michael, they're also talking about violence.
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:28.729]  One of the guys that you quoted here said, well, you said they're not openly telling people to throw projectiles, they're not openly telling people to jump barriers, and of course we've seen that happen at people jumping the barriers to get to Donald Trump, people throwing projectiles and getting physical with people who are just attending an event.
[01:35:29.289 --> 01:35:39.140]  But then they said this, he said, and here's a quote from one of the organizers, I can't comment on any specific stuff that we're doing like that, mostly because that would be illegal.
[01:35:40.506 --> 01:35:42.988]  We got stuff planned that is violent, illegal.
[01:35:43.029 --> 01:35:45.611]  Yeah, we do, but I can't give you any specifics on it.
[01:35:45.911 --> 01:35:47.693]  But yeah, it'll get pretty crazy, he said.
[01:35:47.713 --> 01:35:48.314]  I expect.
[01:35:48.754 --> 01:35:50.176]  Have fun, I say.
[01:35:50.596 --> 01:35:52.658]  That's the quote from one of the guys who organized this.
[01:35:52.678 --> 01:35:59.605]  And I remember, Michael, when I was in college, we had Gerald Ford come speak at our university.
[01:35:59.625 --> 01:36:03.048]  We had some guy thought it would be funny to show up with a squirt gun.
[01:36:04.009 --> 01:36:10.013]  When he was speaking, and the Secret Service rustled him to the ground, and we never saw him again.
[01:36:10.033 --> 01:36:14.755]  I mean, seriously, this guy, he was gone for a long time, he never came back to school.
[01:36:14.815 --> 01:36:17.697]  I don't know what he did with the rest of his life, but he was just gone.
[01:36:18.137 --> 01:36:29.484]  But it's going to be interesting to see what happens with this, but as you pointed out, the real point is to get this photo op of chaos that the media can then use as a narrative to attack Trump, isn't it?
[01:36:30.871 --> 01:36:33.732]  Oh it absolutely does, because they want to provoke a reaction.
[01:36:33.772 --> 01:36:48.358]  They want the television cameras to see not only their protest and the anger, but they want to see the reaction, the cracking down on the protesters and they want it to be as harsh as possible.
[01:36:50.279 --> 01:36:51.759]  They know the legalities of it.
[01:36:51.799 --> 01:36:58.161]  They know how far they can go up to the line, so they don't actually say, hey, we're advocating violence, but you notice what they're saying.
[01:36:58.181 --> 01:37:03.763]  They're saying, hey, we can't legally say that, but hey, we're not exactly discouraging people from it either.
[01:37:04.603 --> 01:37:05.663]  And that's just the start.
[01:37:05.783 --> 01:37:11.205]  And then the next day, after January 20th, January 21st is this Million Woman March.
[01:37:11.285 --> 01:37:18.047]  That's the march Michael Moore was talking about, where it was reported in the New York Times they're hoping to get a million women to Washington, D.C.
[01:37:18.687 --> 01:37:23.349]  To protest for abortion rights, for essentially killing their own children.
[01:37:23.389 --> 01:37:25.269]  But they're hoping to get a million women there.
[01:37:25.950 --> 01:37:29.551]  And Michael Moore says, hey, that could be the start of 100 days of resistance.
[01:37:29.591 --> 01:37:30.991]  That's what Michael Moore is calling it.
[01:37:31.351 --> 01:37:36.293]  What they want to do is they want to make Donald Trump's first 100 days as hard as possible.
[01:37:36.733 --> 01:37:41.015]  And Barack Obama, what Barack Obama is doing right now, is playing right into that.
[01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:47.077]  Because when a new president is elected, the sitting president, the lame duck president,
[01:37:47.637 --> 01:37:49.798]  Well, traditionally, they've kind of stepped back.
[01:37:49.838 --> 01:37:52.640]  They've said, OK, I'm not going to introduce a bunch of new initiatives.
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:58.924]  I'm going to just try to make it an easy transition for the next guy, kind of stepping back and saying, OK, the new guy's coming in.
[01:37:58.944 --> 01:38:00.184]  I'm not going to rock the boat.
[01:38:00.505 --> 01:38:02.906]  But instead, Barack Obama has done just the opposite.
[01:38:02.946 --> 01:38:03.947]  He's been malicious.
[01:38:03.987 --> 01:38:11.391]  He's been going crazy, passing all types of new rules and regulations, establishing national monuments, giving this medal to Joe Biden.
[01:38:11.611 --> 01:38:13.612]  And it just wasn't the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
[01:38:13.812 --> 01:38:16.834]  It was the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, which
[01:38:16.834 --> 01:38:16.934]  Which
[01:38:37.757 --> 01:38:38.538]  Into Poland?
[01:38:38.878 --> 01:38:40.519]  I mean, this is the first time it's ever happened.
[01:38:40.559 --> 01:38:44.282]  It didn't get a lot of attention here in the U.S.
[01:38:44.322 --> 01:38:46.103]  media, but this is a really big deal.
[01:38:46.123 --> 01:38:56.770]  It's just a few thousand troops, but what this does is it's highly symbolic, because it's really poking the bear, poking Russia, because it's very much aggravating Russia.
[01:38:56.790 --> 01:39:00.533]  Because you have to remember, Poland was a member of the Warsaw Pact.
[01:39:01.033 --> 01:39:05.837]  And so to Russia, and it's right close to Russia, so Russia is very, very
[01:39:06.537 --> 01:39:07.338]  Annoyed by this.
[01:39:07.558 --> 01:39:13.384]  And we're also, in late January, NATO troops are going to be stationed from now on in Lithuania.
[01:39:13.464 --> 01:39:19.771]  So NATO troops are going into Lithuania, which is actually part of the Soviet Union, back in the old days.
[01:39:20.091 --> 01:39:22.914]  So David, this is a very, very big deal.
[01:39:23.362 --> 01:39:28.444]  Yeah, we've had an escalation as we've seen with the so-called Russian reset.
[01:39:28.484 --> 01:39:30.265]  We've had the reset of the Cold War.
[01:39:30.766 --> 01:39:36.148]  And it's not, this is permanently putting there, of course, they've had multiple exercises, as you know, Michael.
[01:39:36.768 --> 01:39:40.170]  They've had multiple NATO exercises that come right up to the Russian border.
[01:39:40.450 --> 01:39:40.970]  I don't
[01:39:57.376 --> 01:39:59.156]  Put missiles in Cuba for example.
[01:39:59.196 --> 01:40:00.557]  We know exactly what happened with that.
[01:40:00.617 --> 01:40:01.937]  Or if they were to go to Venezuela.
[01:40:02.097 --> 01:40:12.779]  Or if things were to get frostier with the US and Mexico and somehow Russia or China or say North Korea were to forward place missiles right in Mexico.
[01:40:13.179 --> 01:40:14.860]  That's the way the Russians see this.
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:16.780]  And rightfully so.
[01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:19.040]  It is deliberately provocative.
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.681]  They're trying to be provocative in the same way
[01:40:22.501 --> 01:40:27.987]  That we have Bill Ayers and these communist organizers are trying to be provocative at the inauguration.
[01:40:28.507 --> 01:40:32.412]  And they're trying to provoke an event, just like all these people are.
[01:40:32.772 --> 01:40:34.253]  That's precisely what they're trying to do.
[01:40:34.554 --> 01:40:35.455]  It's a very dangerous thing.
[01:40:35.695 --> 01:40:44.845]  And one of the things that really disturbs me, Michael, is the fact that anyone who says we don't want to escalate tensions, we want to de-escalate tensions, it used to be a virtue
[01:40:45.465 --> 01:40:47.966]  When Richard Nixon said, we're going to have a policy of detente.
[01:40:47.986 --> 01:40:51.967]  We're going to ease this strained relationship between the US and Russia.
[01:40:52.027 --> 01:40:52.887]  Everybody said, that's great.
[01:40:53.207 --> 01:40:54.468]  We're kind of tired of a Cold War.
[01:40:54.728 --> 01:40:57.108]  We don't want to live on the edge of nuclear war.
[01:40:57.468 --> 01:41:02.210]  These people, for the purpose of the military-industrial complex now, want to restart this.
[01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:06.171]  And if you say that you don't want this, you don't want war,
[01:41:07.071 --> 01:41:14.579]  Then these radicals on the left start accusing you and mainstream media like Washington Post, New York Times start accusing you of being a Russian agent.
[01:41:14.819 --> 01:41:15.840]  You're a Manchurian candidate.
[01:41:16.581 --> 01:41:21.045]  The papers that come out and told the truth about Hillary Clinton, they were probed.
[01:41:21.106 --> 01:41:23.388]  I mean, this is the tactic that they're taking.
[01:41:23.588 --> 01:41:26.831]  Anybody who doesn't want war with Russia is a Russian agent.
[01:41:26.891 --> 01:41:27.512]  This is insane.
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:30.341]  Yeah, it absolutely is.
[01:41:30.381 --> 01:41:31.562]  And look how far we've come.
[01:41:31.723 --> 01:41:42.535]  Because just four years ago, if you remember the 2012 election, you know, and Mitt Romney, there was that famous moment in the debate when Mitt Romney was explaining how, hey, he believed Russia was a threat.
[01:41:42.875 --> 01:41:47.280]  And Barack Obama turned to him and said, hey, Mitt, you know, the 1980s are calling.
[01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:48.722]  They want their foreign policy back.
[01:41:49.082 --> 01:41:55.348]  You know, so four years ago, Barack Obama was mocking all this, but now Barack Obama says Russia is enemy number one.
[01:41:55.408 --> 01:41:57.890]  It's not just the Democrats, but it's the Republicans too.
[01:41:58.210 --> 01:42:00.833]  People like Senator John McCain, people like Lindsey Graham.
[01:42:01.133 --> 01:42:02.915]  And so it's a bipartisan thing.
[01:42:02.975 --> 01:42:08.099]  Both sides of the establishment party, if you will, both Democrats and Republicans.
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:10.602]  And so I believe this is a trap for Donald Trump.
[01:42:11.022 --> 01:42:15.086]  Because both parties are going to be putting pressure on him to become more anti-Russia.
[01:42:15.606 --> 01:42:20.871]  And Donald Trump is going to be surrounded by all these guys in the Pentagon, even Mad Dog Mattis.
[01:42:20.891 --> 01:42:25.214]  He was just in front of Congress yesterday talking about how Russia was the primary threat to U.S.
[01:42:25.254 --> 01:42:25.735]  security.
[01:42:26.055 --> 01:42:27.736]  So these people are going to be in his ear.
[01:42:28.017 --> 01:42:35.163]  People on the left, people on the right, Republicans and Democrats are all going to be urging Trump to become more anti-Russia.
[01:42:35.603 --> 01:42:46.425]  And so Donald Trump has got to be strong, and we've got to urge him not to listen to these people, not to listen to both political parties, because they're going to want him to turn on Russia, become so anti-Russia.
[01:42:48.686 --> 01:42:53.307]  But we should be so thankful that Donald Trump is about to be inaugurated.
[01:42:53.347 --> 01:42:58.208]  January 20th can't come fast enough, because right now we are on a path to war with Russia.
[01:42:58.568 --> 01:43:03.909]  When Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats, that's the kind of thing you do before a war starts.
[01:43:04.429 --> 01:43:19.136]  You know, and so all these things, I mean it's been going on for years with Ukraine, where George Soros and other people of his ilk went in and funded and organized and helped overthrow the democratically elected government of Ukraine.
[01:43:19.416 --> 01:43:22.357]  Then a new pro-American government was immediately installed.
[01:43:22.837 --> 01:43:25.598]  That severely, severely upset the Russians.
[01:43:26.258 --> 01:43:27.839]  That very, very much angered them.
[01:43:27.859 --> 01:43:29.679]  And that was kind of the one of the big first steps.
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:37.682]  And then, of course, was Syria, where we went in, we made a big mess of the Middle East, and Russia came in and fought ISIS and helped the Syrian government.
[01:43:38.022 --> 01:43:40.663]  Tensions between us and them have risen there.
[01:43:40.983 --> 01:43:43.084]  So those were big steps down the path.
[01:43:43.304 --> 01:43:46.605]  And so many things now with cyber espionage, the price of oil, everything else.
[01:43:47.505 --> 01:43:54.150]  The tensions between the United States and Russia are the worst they've been since the heart of the Cold War, maybe since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:43:54.490 --> 01:43:56.211]  We're on a path to war with Russia.
[01:43:56.532 --> 01:44:00.774]  Hopefully Donald Trump will stop us and set us on a better course.
[01:44:00.995 --> 01:44:04.237]  And as I said earlier, we haven't seen Russians rounding people up.
[01:44:04.717 --> 01:44:16.549]  Cutting their heads off, putting them in cages and drowning them, doing all these bizarre and disturbing forms of torture, having little children murder bound men and put the videos up.
[01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:17.750]  The Russians aren't doing that.
[01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:21.053]  That's Islamic jihadis, Islamic terrorists.
[01:44:21.554 --> 01:44:25.557]  Those phrases that Obama can't even bring himself to state.
[01:44:26.238 --> 01:44:36.288]  And yet it is Obama, it is the people, as you point out, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, they go and they work with Al-Qaeda, they work with ISIS, they work with al-Nusra, all these different names that they come up with.
[01:44:36.508 --> 01:44:41.372]  They're just aliases for the same group of jihadi terrorists, the same philosophy that's there.
[01:44:41.933 --> 01:44:43.635]  And it came out that John Kerry
[01:44:44.195 --> 01:44:44.395]  I don't
[01:45:00.072 --> 01:45:01.293]  ISIS in that area.
[01:45:01.313 --> 01:45:03.735]  They were willing to do that for their own objectives.
[01:45:04.096 --> 01:45:10.461]  And yet, we're told that the Russians, the people, the only people who are fighting them by the way, it's not the Americans, we're helping them.
[01:45:10.742 --> 01:45:15.546]  We dropped 25,000 bombs and not a single bomb landed on an ISIS-controlled oil field.
[01:45:15.566 --> 01:45:16.327]  What a coincidence.
[01:45:16.787 --> 01:45:18.107]  And so, yeah, you're exactly right.
[01:45:18.368 --> 01:45:19.308]  We need to really understand.
[01:45:19.348 --> 01:45:21.528]  I think people do understand where the true threat is.
[01:45:21.869 --> 01:45:27.570]  When we look at this, and you pointed out Mattis and the confirmation hearings, and we've heard some disturbing things from Mattis.
[01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:32.732]  We've heard some disturbing things from Tillerson that are contradictory to what we've heard from Donald Trump.
[01:45:33.352 --> 01:45:36.476]  Uh, as RT was pointing out, they're concerned that maybe the deep state is winning.
[01:45:36.496 --> 01:45:41.442]  Maybe these guys are throwing up the flag that said Trump finally conceded that Russia hacked the election.
[01:45:41.943 --> 01:45:48.470]  I know that they're doing some things in these confirmation hearings, and when Donald Trump says that, he just tries to say, okay, fine, let's just move on with this.
[01:45:49.311 --> 01:45:52.933]  Personally, I don't think that's the way to handle this, but these guys are a lot more successful than I am.
[01:45:52.973 --> 01:45:56.235]  I'm willing to give them a chance to at least get in there.
[01:45:56.255 --> 01:46:04.419]  So when you look at Tillerson, they questioned him on things like climate change and other issues like that, and he really did hedge his bet.
[01:46:04.439 --> 01:46:08.822]  He wouldn't give them a straight answer as to whether or not he believed that it was man-made.
[01:46:08.862 --> 01:46:10.863]  He said the risk of climate change does exist.
[01:46:11.383 --> 01:46:18.047]  And the consequences of it could be serious enough that action should be taken, but the ability to predict it is very limited.
[01:46:18.087 --> 01:46:24.771]  And so then, finally, Tim Kaine comes after him and says, well, do you lack the knowledge to answer my question, or are you refusing to answer my question?
[01:46:25.152 --> 01:46:26.973]  And Tillerson said, a little of both.
[01:46:28.459 --> 01:46:31.181]  That's probably the funniest thing that's come out of the hearings.
[01:46:31.221 --> 01:46:34.483]  That was probably the most truthful, candid thing right there.
[01:46:34.763 --> 01:46:38.606]  Yeah, you know, I kind of can't answer your question.
[01:46:38.666 --> 01:46:40.027]  I refuse to answer your question.
[01:46:40.607 --> 01:46:42.269]  And hopefully that's what's going on here.
[01:46:42.329 --> 01:46:45.351]  Hopefully these people are not going to be changing the direction that Trump is going.
[01:46:45.651 --> 01:46:47.752]  Hopefully they're not going to be running in the opposite direction.
[01:46:48.213 --> 01:46:50.714]  We saw that happen a great deal during the Reagan administration.
[01:46:50.774 --> 01:46:54.757]  Hopefully he can keep them going or replace them if they're going in the other direction.
[01:46:56.558 --> 01:47:06.144]  When we look at some of the rhetoric that's coming out of these confirmation hearings, I think they're just kind of trying to just get through this without any controversy and say, yeah, I agree with you on all these issues.
[01:47:06.184 --> 01:47:06.845]  What do you think, Michael?
[01:47:08.027 --> 01:47:13.228]  I think there's some of that going on, David, but also we need to keep in account, D.C.
[01:47:13.308 --> 01:47:14.168]  changes people.
[01:47:14.288 --> 01:47:17.109]  I used to work there and so, you know, I kind of saw it up close.
[01:47:17.429 --> 01:47:23.410]  But we've seen for decades, you know, good people, good politicians that we thought would do good things go into D.C.
[01:47:23.890 --> 01:47:24.870]  and they get changed.
[01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:27.711]  And all of a sudden they start talking differently, they have different viewpoints.
[01:47:27.751 --> 01:47:29.191]  Now there's some exceptions.
[01:47:29.231 --> 01:47:30.351]  For example, Ron Paul.
[01:47:30.712 --> 01:47:32.632]  He was never changed by D.C.
[01:47:33.272 --> 01:47:40.857]  But to a very large extent, a lot of these politicians, they promise us all these things, they talk really well, but then they get to D.C.
[01:47:41.317 --> 01:47:42.438]  and things change.
[01:47:42.758 --> 01:47:44.760]  And of course that observation is hundreds of years old.
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:47.341]  You know, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:47:47.361 --> 01:47:50.844]  Boy, you don't have any place where there is more absolute power than in Washington.
[01:47:50.904 --> 01:47:52.565]  That's why we have so much corruption there, isn't it?
[01:47:53.914 --> 01:47:54.635]  Oh absolutely.
[01:47:54.795 --> 01:48:04.707]  And it's even worse when both sides, the Republicans and the Democrats, are all on the same side as far as this Russia thing is concerned.
[01:48:05.708 --> 01:48:09.733]  Because we desperately need a different path.
[01:48:09.813 --> 01:48:11.936]  Because right now we see the anti-Russia
[01:48:12.296 --> 01:48:12.777]  Right, right.
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:40.263]  Now, and then they fast forward that to today, and they say now, once again, Russia's the great force for defending against globalism, against all these things, and they believe the United States is a great force for evil in the world.
[01:48:40.523 --> 01:48:43.864]  And of course, the United States has been leading the march of globalism.
[01:48:43.904 --> 01:48:48.405]  We have been funding groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda in the Middle East, trying to overthrow the Syrian government.
[01:48:48.825 --> 01:48:52.886]  And so, and when Russia goes on television and shows that, hey,
[01:48:53.386 --> 01:48:53.626]  I don't
[01:49:11.061 --> 01:49:15.003]  In the middle of last year, they went over and they took a survey over in Russia.
[01:49:15.223 --> 01:49:18.005]  They asked the Russian people about their approval of current U.S.
[01:49:18.065 --> 01:49:18.865]  leadership, i.e.
[01:49:18.905 --> 01:49:20.166]  the Obama administration.
[01:49:20.546 --> 01:49:24.148]  The results came back with a 1% approval rating.
[01:49:24.968 --> 01:49:26.029]  1% for current U.S.
[01:49:26.069 --> 01:49:26.569]  leadership.
[01:49:26.909 --> 01:49:33.573]  So that's how the Russians view the United States today, where they view us as the big force for evil in the world.
[01:49:33.853 --> 01:49:35.854]  They view us extremely negatively.
[01:49:37.995 --> 01:49:42.739]  Oh, openly talk on their mainstream news broadcast over there about war could be coming with the United States.
[01:49:42.799 --> 01:49:45.941]  Yes, that's why they were so excited with the election of Donald Trump.
[01:49:46.421 --> 01:49:48.323]  They believed that they had dodged a bullet.
[01:49:48.483 --> 01:49:56.829]  We report on the story about the small town in Russia that wanted to change the name of the street that the communists had called Godless Street.
[01:49:57.169 --> 01:49:57.990]  They wanted to change it.
[01:49:58.030 --> 01:50:00.612]  They had to start a petition to change it to Donald Trump Street.
[01:50:00.652 --> 01:50:01.833]  I mean, they realize they have
[01:50:02.293 --> 01:50:10.621]  They have in their own collective memory the understanding of the horrors of war from World War II in a way that we don't in America.
[01:50:10.681 --> 01:50:14.925]  We were attacked at Pearl Harbor, but we never had anybody invade and bomb the homeland.
[01:50:14.965 --> 01:50:17.608]  We didn't have to fight them street by street in the cities.
[01:50:17.688 --> 01:50:18.109]  They did.
[01:50:18.849 --> 01:50:19.089]  I don't know.
[01:50:40.023 --> 01:50:48.267]  Pandering to the senators who want war so they can get in, but don't really believe that Russia annexed the Crimea.
[01:50:48.287 --> 01:50:49.728]  I mean, we talk about that, really?
[01:50:49.748 --> 01:50:58.233]  I mean, yeah, they annexed the Crimea, but it was done by Catherine the Great in 1783, six years before we had the Constitution.
[01:50:58.693 --> 01:51:00.354]  And she took it from the Ottoman Empire.
[01:51:00.894 --> 01:51:08.429]  It wasn't that Putin took it from the Ukraine and they voted to stay with Russia just like Northern Ireland voted to stay with Great Britain.
[01:51:08.449 --> 01:51:10.072]  When we come back, we're going to talk to Michael...
[01:51:16.650 --> 01:51:17.991]  Joining us now is John McAfee.
[01:51:18.011 --> 01:51:20.172]  And of course, John McAfee is no stranger to any of this.
[01:51:20.212 --> 01:51:21.973]  He's not naive about this.
[01:51:22.013 --> 01:51:26.616]  John created McAfee Associates back in 1987, 30 years ago.
[01:51:26.636 --> 01:51:28.477]  You know, John, the U.S.
[01:51:28.517 --> 01:51:34.480]  government hasn't really done a very good job in protecting themselves or protecting us from cyber hacks in the interim years, have they?
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:39.803]  Even though you're now not part of the company, you sold this to Intel Corporation.
[01:51:40.063 --> 01:51:42.405]  But let's talk about the intelligence report
[01:51:43.005 --> 01:51:50.390]  That has surfaced in the circumstantial evidence that they put in there, saying that this is how we know it was the Russians.
[01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:56.834]  Well, I've read that entire 25 page report multiple times.
[01:51:58.215 --> 01:52:00.376]  And half of it is laughable.
[01:52:01.437 --> 01:52:03.378]  It is absurd beyond belief.
[01:52:04.445 --> 01:52:27.111]  For example, they're expecting us to believe that the Russian intelligence services are foolish enough to leave the Russian language in the code, to leave the date and time stamp that the program was compiled, to use a Cyrillic keyboard which could be detected by forensic science,
[01:52:28.532 --> 01:52:34.075]  And lastly, to have an IP address that points back to the Russian Kremlin.
[01:52:35.196 --> 01:52:49.204]  Seriously, the way that this was done and the lack of sophistication suggests a 15-year-old boy or an 18-year-old somewhere who's bored in their bedroom at night going, let's see if I can hack into the DNC.
[01:52:49.724 --> 01:52:54.407]  You notice that as soon as we started pointing fingers at Russia,
[01:52:55.047 --> 01:53:00.972]  As trying to manipulate our elections, nobody's paying any attention to the actual emails anymore.
[01:53:01.112 --> 01:53:01.652]  That's right.
[01:53:01.712 --> 01:53:02.913]  Isn't that the real problem?
[01:53:03.113 --> 01:53:04.634]  Oh yeah.
[01:53:04.694 --> 01:53:07.016]  Isn't that what this is truly about?
[01:53:07.817 --> 01:53:18.004]  Misconduct that no one's paying any attention to now because we have a misdirection going, oh there's something far more important than this misconduct.
[01:53:18.464 --> 01:53:21.987]  And that is the fact that it was the Russians that told us about it.
[01:53:22.487 --> 01:53:22.867]  Please.
[01:53:23.528 --> 01:53:24.488]  Wake up America.
[01:53:24.788 --> 01:53:25.669]  Wake the F up.
[01:53:26.189 --> 01:53:28.710]  We are bamboozled by our government.
[01:53:29.351 --> 01:53:43.558]  They can put out these 25 page reports and suddenly every news agency except for the places like Alex Jones or RT where I was talking last night, everybody's just repeating it as if it's true.
[01:53:43.598 --> 01:53:44.278]  I don't know.
[01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:20.492]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:20.512 --> 01:54:29.482]  I'm David Knight and we have Michael Snyder with EconomicCollapseBlog.com joining us before we get back to... and I want to ask Michael the question that...
[01:54:30.766 --> 01:54:43.129]  Alex Jones wanted us to talk about, and that is what can be done to focus attention on these tactics of disruption, of trying to create martial law that we see, of trying to burn down the Trump administration.
[01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:46.110]  What is it that we can do that the public can do?
[01:54:46.170 --> 01:54:55.792]  What can you as a member of the public, because it's not just us talking about these issues, but it's also important for you to push this out yourself.
[01:54:55.852 --> 01:54:58.073]  I think one of the key things that's going to be at the inauguration
[01:54:58.573 --> 01:54:59.794]  People, keep your phones going.
[01:54:59.814 --> 01:55:02.676]  You're going to have your phones, you're going to be videotaping this stuff anyway.
[01:55:02.716 --> 01:55:10.901]  But of course, if you see these people instigating stuff, you can be the eyes on the ground that we can use to push back against the mainstream media's narrative.
[01:55:10.941 --> 01:55:15.844]  They want this to show the police as being the aggressors.
[01:55:15.924 --> 01:55:17.685]  If the police are the aggressors, fine.
[01:55:17.745 --> 01:55:18.745]  Let's show that.
[01:55:18.885 --> 01:55:21.307]  But that's not going to be the case, I don't think, in this particular case.
[01:55:21.747 --> 01:55:22.068]  Yes, we are.
[01:55:38.530 --> 01:55:42.172]  Put up a special for a 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[01:55:42.473 --> 01:55:45.614]  Very important this time of year to set up healthy habits.
[01:55:45.715 --> 01:55:56.601]  One of the things that you can do is make sure that you have the right kind of nutrients, essential minerals to fight the toxic garbage that you're going to find in your food, your water, and your air.
[01:55:56.641 --> 01:56:00.424]  And also to give your body the nutritional support that it needs.
[01:56:00.524 --> 01:56:03.566]  And we've put a lot of things on sale from 10% to 20% to 30%.
[01:56:03.626 --> 01:56:04.026]  We've got a
[01:56:07.288 --> 01:56:08.749]  New shipment now of DNA Force.
[01:56:08.809 --> 01:56:10.530]  It's just arrived at Infowarslife.com.
[01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:11.891]  That's been out for some time.
[01:56:11.911 --> 01:56:19.435]  And of course, DNA Force is a powerful lineup of patented ingredients like Bio-PQQ and systemic enzymes.
[01:56:19.475 --> 01:56:23.578]  We have 175 clinical studies that show how effective Bio-PQQ is.
[01:56:23.598 --> 01:56:25.198]  You can look those up yourself.
[01:56:25.299 --> 01:56:27.100]  Just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:32.643]  It's very difficult to produce, very expensive to produce, so 10% is a big discount.
[01:56:33.343 --> 01:56:35.424]  And also, move on this while it is still there.
[01:56:35.444 --> 01:56:42.729]  We've just gotten a temporary emergency shipment of this, so when that goes out, it could be months before we are able to put that back in again.
[01:56:42.809 --> 01:56:51.034]  Also, if you want to make sure that you support that healthy habits that you get in, make sure that you always have the supplements that you want, you can sign up for AutoShip.
[01:56:51.154 --> 01:56:54.336]  Always get a 10% discount on the things that you get on AutoShip.
[01:56:54.636 --> 01:56:57.738]  If you get more than $50 at a time, you'll also get free shipping.
[01:56:58.078 --> 01:57:05.360]  But right now we also have 20% off Secret 12, our vitamin B12, 20% off Liver Shield, Knockout, and Prostagard.
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:12.222]  We have 30% off Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine, 30% off Super Male Vitality, 30% off Brain Force.
[01:57:12.242 --> 01:57:15.323]  You'll find all of those at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:57:16.786 --> 01:57:20.330]  So Michael, we're going to put this story back up to the top that you wrote.
[01:57:20.490 --> 01:57:24.875]  Anarchists are hoping to turn Donald Trump's inauguration into one of the biggest riots in U.S.
[01:57:24.895 --> 01:57:25.155]  history.
[01:57:25.175 --> 01:57:25.756]  We'll put that there.
[01:57:25.796 --> 01:57:28.839]  We'll cut this interview and put that in there as well as an update.
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:33.685]  But apart from that, apart from passing information around, what would you suggest that people do?
[01:57:35.148 --> 01:57:36.629]  Well, that's one of the biggest things, David.
[01:57:36.669 --> 01:57:39.931]  People need to realize we're still in an information war.
[01:57:40.271 --> 01:57:45.114]  And just look at this recent thing with the ridiculous allegations that were made against Donald Trump.
[01:57:45.134 --> 01:57:51.258]  These were put forth seriously by BuzzFeed, by CNN, and they wanted people to believe this stuff.
[01:57:51.318 --> 01:57:58.322]  But then the alternative media started making all kinds of noise about, hey, this is fake, this was made up, this is a joke.
[01:57:58.623 --> 01:58:04.006]  And so the mainstream media was then forced to admit that, oh yeah, this is fake, this wasn't true, or whatever.
[01:58:04.226 --> 01:58:07.387]  But that battle was won through the information war.
[01:58:07.547 --> 01:58:14.129]  And what's coming up on January 20th is going to be won through information, through winning the battle, through making noise.
[01:58:14.249 --> 01:58:16.009]  Or this situation with Russia.
[01:58:16.269 --> 01:58:19.830]  We've got to make a whole bunch of noise that we don't want war with Russia.
[01:58:19.930 --> 01:58:22.231]  We've got to win in the court of public opinion.
[01:58:22.591 --> 01:58:24.112]  And so everybody can make noise.
[01:58:24.252 --> 01:58:26.032]  Everybody can let their voice be heard.
[01:58:26.052 --> 01:58:29.033]  And that's one of the great things about the Internet.
[01:58:29.053 --> 01:58:32.194]  Because with the Internet comes the democratization of information.
[01:58:32.574 --> 01:58:33.014]  Absolutely.
[01:58:33.474 --> 01:58:36.055]  Everyone can become foot soldiers in the information war.
[01:58:36.135 --> 01:58:36.495]  Absolutely.
[01:58:36.755 --> 01:58:37.915]  We're out of time for this segment.
[01:58:37.935 --> 01:58:39.995]  We're going to be right back right after the break, short break.
[01:58:40.015 --> 01:58:41.536]  We're going to be back with Michael Snyder.
[01:58:41.556 --> 01:58:43.536]  We're going to talk about some economic issues.
[01:58:43.696 --> 01:58:46.897]  His other article, why are Walmart and Boeing layoff workers if the U.S.
[01:58:46.937 --> 01:58:49.097]  economy is in the great shape that Obama says it is.
[01:58:49.117 --> 01:58:49.717]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:52.338 --> 01:58:55.299]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:25.536 --> 02:00:30.518]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.

[02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:39.681]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:00:40.041 --> 02:00:41.642]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:46.212]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:46.272 --> 02:00:50.558]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Michael Snyder of the EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[02:00:51.038 --> 02:00:55.604]  We've got one more segment here with Michael and then we're going to be talking to Craig Richardson.
[02:00:55.664 --> 02:01:01.251]  He is president of the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, E&E Legal.
[02:01:01.772 --> 02:01:08.261]  And we're going to talk to him amongst other things about their paper, the Rockefeller Way, the family's covert climate change plan.
[02:01:08.281 --> 02:01:13.068]  In other words, you know, what is really behind this climate change agenda?
[02:01:13.108 --> 02:01:16.592]  And we have seen an explosion in regulations at the last minute.
[02:01:17.133 --> 02:01:19.454]  From Barack Obama and guess where most of them are coming?
[02:01:19.794 --> 02:01:21.374]  They're coming from the EPA.
[02:01:21.754 --> 02:01:23.175]  They're coming every day.
[02:01:23.195 --> 02:01:26.396]  The EPA is trying to shut down another major car company.
[02:01:26.416 --> 02:01:40.120]  So we're going to talk to him about what he thinks is going to happen in a Trump administration because he's already picked somebody as the head of the EPA that has taken on the EPA in the past for their overreach, their unconstitutional, illegal overreach.
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:43.925]  But going back to Michael, I want to talk to you about this article you have.
[02:01:43.965 --> 02:01:46.910]  Why are Walmart and Boeing laying off workers if the U.S.
[02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:48.953]  economy is in such good shape?
[02:01:49.354 --> 02:01:50.436]  What do you think is going on here?
[02:01:50.456 --> 02:01:52.940]  Tell people what's going on and what you think is behind it.
[02:01:54.076 --> 02:01:56.817]  Well, I think what is going on is a retail apocalypse.
[02:01:56.897 --> 02:02:01.600]  We're talking about the biggest retailers in the United States, legendary names.
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:10.965]  We're talking about Walmart laying off, you know, a thousand workers, you know, most of them at their headquarters there in Bentonville, Arkansas.
[02:02:11.385 --> 02:02:13.506]  You know, and if you go into Walmart today, you'll notice
[02:02:13.886 --> 02:02:14.286]  I don't
[02:02:31.834 --> 02:02:32.674]  Conditions are changing.
[02:02:33.034 --> 02:02:34.035]  Or you look at Macy's.
[02:02:34.115 --> 02:02:34.835]  Macy's is closed.
[02:02:34.995 --> 02:02:37.996]  They said, hey, we're closing another 100 stores approximately.
[02:02:38.017 --> 02:02:40.998]  And, you know, they've fallen on harder times.
[02:02:41.038 --> 02:02:42.378]  Things have gotten tougher for them.
[02:02:42.398 --> 02:02:48.601]  And then, of course, Sears, where they've been closing stores for a long time, they're going to be closing another 150 stores.
[02:02:48.921 --> 02:02:51.502]  They're losing hundreds of millions of dollars every quarter.
[02:02:51.582 --> 02:02:55.704]  I don't know how you lose hundreds of millions of dollars in a single quarter, but they're doing it.
[02:02:55.824 --> 02:02:57.604]  And Sears is headed for bankruptcy.
[02:02:57.624 --> 02:02:58.565]  They're going to zero.
[02:02:59.065 --> 02:03:06.270]  So the biggest, most powerful retailers all across the country, the limited, just came out within the past few days.
[02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:08.151]  They said, we're shutting down all our stores.
[02:03:09.052 --> 02:03:11.353]  So we're not going to have any stores at all anymore.
[02:03:11.413 --> 02:03:13.014]  They're still going to have an online presence.
[02:03:13.394 --> 02:03:15.456]  Yeah, Sears just sold off Craftsman Tools.
[02:03:15.516 --> 02:03:17.977]  I mean, that's one of the longest standing things out there.
[02:03:17.997 --> 02:03:20.059]  So another sign of the problems that they're having at Sears.
[02:03:21.292 --> 02:03:22.073]  Oh, it definitely is.
[02:03:22.093 --> 02:03:22.673]  Because U.S.
[02:03:22.713 --> 02:03:24.174]  consumers are tapped out.
[02:03:24.294 --> 02:03:30.599]  You know, one recent survey found that 69% of all Americans have less than $1,000 in savings.
[02:03:30.719 --> 02:03:33.702]  So basically living paycheck to paycheck two-thirds of the country.
[02:03:34.082 --> 02:03:37.545]  So consumers don't have the same kind of money to spend as they used to spend.
[02:03:37.585 --> 02:03:44.190]  We've got, you know, in recent years there's been the economic prosperity or any type of a boom has
[02:03:44.730 --> 02:03:47.852]  Basically gone to the top 1%, maybe the top 5%.
[02:03:48.192 --> 02:03:53.576]  But for ordinary Americans, things have gotten tougher because the cost of living, Obamacare, everything else has gone up.
[02:03:53.956 --> 02:03:56.598]  Meanwhile, wages have not kept pace, so things have been tough.
[02:03:57.098 --> 02:04:01.341]  And one leading indicator of potential economic trouble is, you look at the airlines.
[02:04:01.661 --> 02:04:06.244]  Delta just came out with extremely disappointing results, and Boeing.
[02:04:06.544 --> 02:04:15.630]  Boeing is laying off engineers, and they say more layoff announcements are coming for other types of workers as well, because their sales are way down, sales of aircraft.
[02:04:15.670 --> 02:04:17.791]  In fact, 53% just since 2014, just over a couple of years.
[02:04:20.353 --> 02:04:24.734]  And so what this is saying, when the economy is booming, air traffic tends to increase.
[02:04:25.134 --> 02:04:29.436]  But when economic conditions start to tighten up, air traffic tends to diminish.
[02:04:29.456 --> 02:04:35.777]  And that's what we're starting to see right now, where these aircraft and airline companies are starting to struggle a bit.
[02:04:36.077 --> 02:04:43.419]  So there's all kinds of, you know, Donald Trump's coming in, but there's all kinds of indications with the real economy that things are starting to slow down.
[02:04:43.679 --> 02:04:48.921]  So he might be presented some real significant economic challenges right away in his presidency.
[02:04:49.241 --> 02:04:49.722]  Absolutely.
[02:04:49.762 --> 02:04:55.046]  And of course, as reported yesterday, 97% of the recovery that did happen went to the upper 1%.
[02:04:55.086 --> 02:04:57.549]  So it's really a tale of two economies.
[02:04:57.569 --> 02:05:01.772]  It's one of the reasons why the Democrats lost so many offices under President Obama.
[02:05:01.812 --> 02:05:05.396]  Thank you so much, Michael Snyder, EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[02:05:05.716 --> 02:05:06.116]  Stay with us.
[02:05:06.136 --> 02:05:12.142]  We'll be right back with Craig Richardson, and we're going to talk about the... We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com.
[02:05:14.263 --> 02:05:25.310]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:05:25.370 --> 02:05:30.313]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:05:30.413 --> 02:05:34.416]  It helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[02:05:34.696 --> 02:05:37.518]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:05:37.578 --> 02:05:42.342]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:05:42.362 --> 02:05:53.930]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:05:54.050 --> 02:05:55.491]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[02:05:55.671 --> 02:05:56.412]  This is so key.
[02:05:56.672 --> 02:06:00.955]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:06:00.995 --> 02:06:03.057]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[02:06:03.277 --> 02:06:08.899]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:06:09.899 --> 02:06:18.901]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:06:18.981 --> 02:06:27.224]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:06:27.384 --> 02:06:32.065]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:06:32.265 --> 02:06:38.989]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:39.049 --> 02:06:46.133]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:06:46.233 --> 02:06:53.117]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:06:53.257 --> 02:06:57.599]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:06:57.739 --> 02:07:00.941]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:07:09.791 --> 02:07:21.205]  Yesterday, the Senate took the first step towards repealing the Affordable Care Act with a 51-48 vote on a new budget blueprint that would open the doors to gut and rid ourselves of the disaster that is Obamacare without allowing Democrats to filibuster.
[02:07:21.345 --> 02:07:34.177]  Liberal tears flowed heavy as the Senate had to be called in order every time a Democrat voted no, with a nice lecture to go with it, forcing the providing officer, Senator Cory Gardner, to slam his gavel and scold the Democrats, repeating ad nauseam, debate is not allowed during a vote.
[02:07:34.297 --> 02:07:37.260]  Now today, the vote moves on to the House, where we have had similar results.
[02:07:37.380 --> 02:07:47.349]  The debate has been heated, with Democrats speaking past their time, bringing in large, blown up photos of children to win sympathy points, and trying to argue that Republicans are ending health care, like before the Affordable Care Act, right?
[02:07:47.489 --> 02:07:59.755]  Senator Hakeem Jeffries claims that voting against the Affordable Care Act sets up Americans to be screwed by bigwigs and fat cats in the healthcare industry, ignoring the fact that this is what the Affordable Care Act did, creating healthcare monopolies in some regions.
[02:07:59.915 --> 02:08:05.678]  He also said that Republicans had no plan, to which Republicans responded by showing the many plans they brought to the debate floor.
[02:08:05.778 --> 02:08:09.020]  This is Owen Troyer, and I've got jugs of liberal tears here.
[02:08:17.521 --> 02:08:26.870]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[02:08:31.386 --> 02:08:32.727]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:32.787 --> 02:08:39.072]  I'm David Knight, and we're going to be talking to Craig Richardson with Energy and Environment Legal Institute.
[02:08:39.112 --> 02:08:42.695]  And let me tell you one of the reasons that we wanted to talk to Mr. Richardson.
[02:08:42.715 --> 02:08:58.988]  Of course, we want to talk to him about what's coming up with the Trump administration, with the EPA, because they have been at the forefront of shutting down our energy, but also increasing the regulatory burden in a very unprecedented, very unconstitutional way.
[02:08:59.668 --> 02:09:11.176]  During the Barack Obama administration, and they have been at the forefront these last days, this explosion of regulations, this explosion of chains that Obama is trying to put on the American people.
[02:09:11.777 --> 02:09:13.318]  They have been at the forefront of this.
[02:09:13.598 --> 02:09:20.743]  Every day, this week, they have come after another major automobile manufacturer, trying to shut them down because they sell diesel engines.
[02:09:21.424 --> 02:09:23.385]  And it's not just about diesel engines, folks.
[02:09:23.925 --> 02:09:25.527]  It's not about fine particulate matter.
[02:09:26.387 --> 02:09:48.208]  They've had their own cheating test that we caught them in in North Carolina, where they were testing on human beings and cheating on those tests, trying to show how dangerous fine particulate matter was, so they could shut down coal, so they could shut down diesels, because those are very efficient competitors to the energy providers that they want to subsidize, their crony capitalist friends.
[02:09:48.249 --> 02:09:49.229]  And so in light of that,
[02:09:49.850 --> 02:10:01.019]  I wanted to get him on because New American was talking about this new report, which actually comes from his organization, Energy and Environment Legal Institute, a new report that exposes the Rockefeller dynasty's role in the climate scam.
[02:10:01.039 --> 02:10:03.941]  And this is how New American begins their article.
[02:10:03.981 --> 02:10:16.791]  They say, an unfathomably wealthy banking and oil dynasty has been hijacking governments, media organs, universities, non-profits, other power centers to expand its control over the economy and the energy sector in particular.
[02:10:17.231 --> 02:10:20.413]  According to a recently released investigation by a watchdog group.
[02:10:20.953 --> 02:10:23.655]  So we have Craig Richardson with that watchdog group.
[02:10:23.695 --> 02:10:28.417]  He is the president of B&E Legal Season Professional with more than 25 years of experience.
[02:10:28.457 --> 02:10:30.378]  He's worked for Congressman Steve Larget.
[02:10:30.438 --> 02:10:34.661]  He's worked for many offices and campaigns and U.S.
[02:10:34.701 --> 02:10:36.081]  Senators and U.S.
[02:10:36.202 --> 02:10:36.662]  Congressmen.
[02:10:37.242 --> 02:10:42.567]  He has participated in numerous issue campaigns, including anti-tax and deregulation initiatives.
[02:10:42.587 --> 02:10:45.069]  The website is eelegal.org.
[02:10:45.509 --> 02:10:49.773]  And of course, hopefully we are going to see some deregulation from the EPA.
[02:10:49.813 --> 02:10:56.839]  Let's talk about first, what do you think is going to happen with the new head of the EPA?
[02:10:56.879 --> 02:11:01.663]  We have the Attorney General from Oklahoma, who has been at the forefront of opposing
[02:11:02.504 --> 02:11:09.910]  Uh, over aggressive regulation from the EPA, and he's proud of that, and he's the person that Donald Trump has selected to be the head of the EPA.
[02:11:10.510 --> 02:11:15.434]  Tell us, Mr. Richardson, what are your expectations as we see moving forward?
[02:11:15.454 --> 02:11:20.358]  Do you think he's going to roll back some of these things that are being put on us at the last minute by Barack Obama?
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:21.860]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:11:22.121 --> 02:11:27.164]  I don't think you could have hand-picked a better person than Attorney General Scott Pruitt for many reasons.
[02:11:27.784 --> 02:11:33.668]  For those who don't know, he is Attorney General from Oklahoma, a very important energy-producing state.
[02:11:33.688 --> 02:11:44.455]  He was one of the 26 or 27 Attorney Generals that sued the federal government over the Clean Power Plan, or as a colleague of mine refers to it, the Creating Poverty Plan.
[02:11:45.036 --> 02:11:46.377]  So he understands that.
[02:11:46.437 --> 02:11:50.760]  Philosophically, he is a Federalist, meaning he understands that this
[02:11:51.700 --> 02:12:03.146]  Overreach by the federal government over the last 40-50 years, and most particularly the last eight, is not healthy for the economy and also not healthy for the environment.
[02:12:03.166 --> 02:12:04.947]  So here's a guy who understands it all.
[02:12:05.007 --> 02:12:05.787]  He's going to come in.
[02:12:06.507 --> 02:12:13.291]  I know many of the people that he's put on the transition team itself, and as the old expression goes, personnel is policy.
[02:12:13.971 --> 02:12:19.834]  So the people he's surrounded with, Myron Ebel of the Competitive Enterprise Institute is leading the transition team.
[02:12:20.395 --> 02:12:23.176]  A great group, libertarian, right of center.
[02:12:23.636 --> 02:12:26.718]  Myron's been working on this kinds of issues for his whole career.
[02:12:26.738 --> 02:12:33.782]  And other people that he brings in around to help that transition out really are very stalwart.
[02:12:34.622 --> 02:12:35.523]  Free market people.
[02:12:35.563 --> 02:12:37.184]  So I expect great changes.
[02:12:37.504 --> 02:12:44.988]  I saw in your lead up this president going out has been more prolific than any other I can ever remember in history.
[02:12:45.068 --> 02:12:49.051]  I think somebody needs to remind him that his side lost and it's time for him to pack up and go.
[02:12:49.511 --> 02:12:57.900]  Well, you know, even before he won the very first time, he came out as he was campaigning and saying, you can build a coal plant, but we're going to bankrupt you if you do.
[02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:08.852]  And now they're going through, after coming close to bankrupting the coal industry during his eight years, in his final days, it looks like they're trying to bankrupt one car company after the other for the sin
[02:13:09.492 --> 02:13:16.175]  ...of creating an internal combustion engine because they can't do enough to subsidize the battery-run cars.
[02:13:16.435 --> 02:13:18.056]  People don't want to buy the electric cars.
[02:13:18.256 --> 02:13:18.996]  They're not there yet.
[02:13:19.016 --> 02:13:20.297]  The technology is not there yet.
[02:13:20.357 --> 02:13:22.397]  It's not as durable as these other cars.
[02:13:22.438 --> 02:13:35.103]  They want something that is planned obsolescence, I believe, so that they can wean us off of private car ownership and put us into another type of control grid that goes back to their Agenda 2030 and Agenda 21 sustainability issues.
[02:13:38.024 --> 02:13:47.608]  But that's what we've seen from this administration is bankrupting entire industries and using the EPA as a massive tool of social engineering.
[02:13:47.648 --> 02:13:48.708]  And I agree with you.
[02:13:48.749 --> 02:13:52.350]  I think that Pruitt is one of the best picks that Donald Trump has made.
[02:13:52.370 --> 02:13:56.812]  I'm really hoping that we're going to see some massive changes at the EPA.
[02:13:56.872 --> 02:14:04.055]  It really needs to be totally changed in terms of that corporate culture that they've got going there.
[02:14:05.029 --> 02:14:06.190]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:17.659]  And there's no question in some of our Freedom of Information Work Act that we did show that this administration, meaning the one that's about to leave, thank God, literally came in there on day one.
[02:14:17.679 --> 02:14:22.583]  I mean, we found documents going back to the same time period eight years ago, leading up into the transition.
[02:14:22.603 --> 02:14:26.486]  But they had that game plan in place, what ultimately became the Clean Power Plan.
[02:14:26.906 --> 02:14:27.966]  They were going to come in.
[02:14:28.326 --> 02:14:32.427]  They had already identified coal-fired power plants that they were going to shut down.
[02:14:32.847 --> 02:14:39.169]  They came in with a plan, and you mentioned it's all part of the UN's effort as well at the international level, but that's essentially the plan.
[02:14:39.209 --> 02:14:48.651]  The plan was to shut down coal first, open up the renewable energy markets, push that all to their green corporate friends like Tom Steyer, who are already set up in there.
[02:14:48.931 --> 02:14:53.934]  And as well as just trying to completely control how much energy is used by the American public.
[02:14:54.235 --> 02:15:00.399]  And as we've seen, too, after eight years, completely devastating the energy, the overall energy markets.
[02:15:00.439 --> 02:15:03.060]  I mean, we have so much untapped potential in this country.
[02:15:03.481 --> 02:15:10.465]  So many great jobs that could be created by allowing us to do and produce and drill and other things in our own country.
[02:15:10.485 --> 02:15:16.529]  And then, of course, you've got the whole issue of getting us finally weaning us off of oil from the Middle East.
[02:15:16.610 --> 02:15:18.471]  I mean, great, certainly foreign policy.
[02:15:19.351 --> 02:15:27.973]  And I don't think it's even an environmental issue if you look at this.
[02:15:28.013 --> 02:15:35.535]  If you look at coal, they've got coal-powered plants that they could make clean, but they wanted to shut it down because they wanted to move us in a different direction.
[02:15:35.815 --> 02:15:42.237]  And this is very important for people to understand how the Rockefellers are behind this and how this is a move from different
[02:15:42.937 --> 02:15:55.141]  Globalist elites to shut down one industry and move things over to another industry to use this as a justification for centralized globalization, centralized global control.
[02:15:55.721 --> 02:16:00.943]  But I think it's also an important story, Craig, about what happens to individuals.
[02:16:01.043 --> 02:16:09.366]  We saw what happened to this guy who had eight acres in Montana and he had a pond that he put on his land and he
[02:16:10.006 --> 02:16:14.187]  Well, it went through all the permits with the state government, with the local government, everything was fine.
[02:16:14.227 --> 02:16:19.469]  And then the EPA said, no, we own all the water in the United States and we don't like what you did here.
[02:16:19.489 --> 02:16:23.790]  And we're going to impose fines of tens of thousands of dollars a day against you.
[02:16:23.810 --> 02:16:27.831]  We're going to come after you and try to attach, garnish your wages.
[02:16:27.891 --> 02:16:28.711]  He worked as a welder.
[02:16:29.211 --> 02:16:31.513]  This is the kind of oppression that the EPA does.
[02:16:31.993 --> 02:16:46.824]  And Craig, as you know, as this was going on, they're polluting in a massive way this, the, uh, I think it was the Aname River that went through three different states because they went in, they were warned by a veteran engineer that what they were doing at one of these mines was going to explode.
[02:16:46.924 --> 02:16:49.726]  And he even said before they did it, he said, they want to do this.
[02:16:50.166 --> 02:17:02.534]  Because they want to create a super fund, and then they went ahead and did it, and it turned out exactly the way that retired engineer pointed out, and they polluted the water over three states and an Indian reservation, and with heavy metal.
[02:17:02.594 --> 02:17:12.121]  So these are the same people saying we're protecting the environment, persecuting this small individual on his eight acres, and then polluting a river over three states and an Indian reservation.
[02:17:12.918 --> 02:17:15.939]  Yeah, and I think you hit the nail on the head because this has nothing to do with the environment.
[02:17:15.999 --> 02:17:16.539]  Let's face it.
[02:17:16.579 --> 02:17:24.823]  One of the things I'm very offended by, I come from New England with a long family history in conservation and using the land for purposes.
[02:17:24.923 --> 02:17:30.125]  A good friend of mine, Debbie, is a fifth generation rancher in California and they're doing the same thing with her.
[02:17:30.905 --> 02:17:32.126]  Ended up running for Congress.
[02:17:32.146 --> 02:17:33.206]  She couldn't take it anymore.
[02:17:33.226 --> 02:17:37.569]  I mean, these have been stewards of their land and raising cattle and doing everything else.
[02:17:37.629 --> 02:17:44.753]  And as she always points out, I can't think of anybody more who's more into their own property and protecting it than we are.
[02:17:44.793 --> 02:17:48.855]  And why is this unelected group of people out of Washington coming in here and telling us what to do?
[02:17:48.935 --> 02:17:52.176]  And all those horror stories you pointed out are exactly right.
[02:17:52.216 --> 02:17:56.359]  Because the point is, in the end, they're not about trying to make the environment better.
[02:17:56.699 --> 02:17:58.560]  They're not about clean water and everything else.
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:00.562]  It's about centralized control.
[02:18:00.982 --> 02:18:05.366]  It's about shifting industries from one to another like we discussed.
[02:18:05.666 --> 02:18:15.554]  The irony is you get a guy like Tom Steyer who spends millions of dollars on elections trying to shut down coal-fired power plants, yet here's a guy who made money in coal-fired power plants.
[02:18:15.895 --> 02:18:22.140]  His old hedge funds still do, citing them overseas, so he's still making money on it.
[02:18:22.260 --> 02:18:23.001]  George Soros,
[02:18:23.701 --> 02:18:28.866]  Once the coal stocks went down to near zero, went running around buying up all the assets.
[02:18:28.886 --> 02:18:31.388]  So this isn't about trying to clean up the environment.
[02:18:31.408 --> 02:18:39.875]  This is about trying to do, control the asset, control the resources, and then also prop up this sort of fake green energy industry.
[02:18:39.935 --> 02:18:44.780]  That's what this renewable energy plans are all about, where you have these unrealistic levels of attainment.
[02:18:45.060 --> 02:18:48.403]  Because Al Gore and everybody else is already knee-deep in that industry already.
[02:18:48.863 --> 02:18:53.247]  Yeah, you're talking about Soros and Al Gore, but also Elon Musk.
[02:18:53.327 --> 02:19:01.735]  This is a guy, the LA Times pointed out, has gotten over four billion dollars of government subsidies to build factories, subsidization of the cars that he sells.
[02:19:01.775 --> 02:19:11.864]  Of course, the cars that you buy with internal combustion engines, whether the gasoline or diesel, they have a higher price because that money is going to be subsidizing cars that people buy from Tesla.
[02:19:12.144 --> 02:19:16.088]  And yet, at the same time, they just put a four billion dollar charge against
[02:19:16.888 --> 02:19:20.810]  A Volkswagen arrested one of the executives, charged him criminally.
[02:19:21.090 --> 02:19:22.390]  Nobody has died here.
[02:19:22.990 --> 02:19:31.574]  They've never taken this kind of action against any car company before, even though they've had situations where they've had exploding Pintos, they've had SUVs that are rolling over, they've had...
[02:19:32.734 --> 02:19:34.435]  Airbags have exploded and killed people.
[02:19:34.475 --> 02:19:38.696]  They've never taken this type of action before like they have against VW.
[02:19:38.736 --> 02:19:42.657]  Now, each successive day, we're seeing them go after Chrysler, taking their stock.
[02:19:42.897 --> 02:19:44.537]  Going after Renault, taking their stock.
[02:19:44.557 --> 02:19:47.538]  But meanwhile, transferring money to Elon Musk.
[02:19:47.598 --> 02:19:49.899]  They have their preferred people.
[02:19:50.039 --> 02:19:51.259]  It's crony capitalism.
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:56.201]  And when we come back, we're going to have Craig Richardson with E&E Legal.
[02:19:56.821 --> 02:20:00.002]  Breakdown for us how the Rockefellers are behind this.
[02:20:00.482 --> 02:20:01.262]  So stay with us.
[02:20:01.282 --> 02:20:02.002]  We're going to be right back.
[02:20:02.042 --> 02:20:02.923]  Very interesting report.
[02:20:10.704 --> 02:20:15.486]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[02:20:15.646 --> 02:20:17.686]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down.
[02:20:17.706 --> 02:20:19.006]  I quit working out.
[02:20:19.026 --> 02:20:22.707]  I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[02:20:22.947 --> 02:20:25.348]  I started to exercise really hard again.
[02:20:25.808 --> 02:20:31.429]  And I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[02:20:31.950 --> 02:20:42.432]  But when I started working with Dr. Group and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[02:20:42.492 --> 02:20:42.752]  Boom!
[02:20:43.172 --> 02:20:46.613]  Weight started pouring off, toxins started coming out of my body.
[02:20:47.073 --> 02:20:48.234]  Then, by early 2016,
[02:20:50.314 --> 02:20:53.655]  I was in the best shape of my life since I've been in really good shape in my twenties.
[02:20:53.675 --> 02:20:54.756]  But the election heated up.
[02:20:54.796 --> 02:20:57.156]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[02:20:57.276 --> 02:21:06.519]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[02:21:06.759 --> 02:21:07.700]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[02:21:07.880 --> 02:21:11.561]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[02:21:12.381 --> 02:21:18.449]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again, and I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[02:21:18.489 --> 02:21:19.810]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[02:21:19.890 --> 02:21:23.455]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[02:21:25.273 --> 02:21:32.079]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[02:21:32.419 --> 02:21:38.905]  I've lost five pounds religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[02:21:39.305 --> 02:21:39.826]  It's amazing.
[02:21:40.126 --> 02:21:42.508]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[02:21:42.788 --> 02:21:45.431]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:21:49.158 --> 02:21:49.778]  Well, here we are.
[02:21:49.818 --> 02:21:50.919]  Another week has passed.
[02:21:51.500 --> 02:22:03.607]  If memory serves, I lost 5 pounds the first week, 3 pounds the next, and only 1 pound this week because it's the holidays, there's fudge, there's candy, it's everywhere, and I've been picking out eggnog, you name it.
[02:22:03.627 --> 02:22:05.569]  This is the worst time of year, but usually you're gaining weight.
[02:22:06.049 --> 02:22:06.969]  I've lost a pound.
[02:22:07.470 --> 02:22:08.250]  So we're now up to 9 pounds.
[02:22:09.983 --> 02:22:14.168]  And I've only got a week and a half left or so until we see what happens in this experiment.
[02:22:14.188 --> 02:22:15.810]  But I'm pretty happy with 9 pounds.
[02:22:15.850 --> 02:22:17.912]  But I want to lose 5 or 6 more.
[02:22:18.753 --> 02:22:23.438]  But as I said, I'm working out less, I'm eating more, I'm taking the supplements, I'm losing weight.
[02:22:23.979 --> 02:22:26.442]  Whatever is doing to me metabolically is amazing.
[02:22:26.562 --> 02:22:28.104]  Let's see what happens next week.
[02:22:32.079 --> 02:22:34.280]  Well, this is the final update on our little experiment.
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:39.163]  I started out in early December, and indeed, I pigged out over Christmas even more than usual.
[02:22:39.883 --> 02:22:44.385]  I did have better and more intense workouts because of Supermail and just what it does to my mental picture.
[02:22:44.445 --> 02:22:53.010]  But taking the entire family of InfoWars life products, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Fruit Punch, Multivitamin, all of it with the amino acids,
[02:22:53.410 --> 02:22:53.910]  We're good to go.
[02:23:15.566 --> 02:23:20.210]  My mother had brought over a pumpkin pie, and the day before that had three pieces of cherry pie.
[02:23:20.810 --> 02:23:34.082]  I'm not a big sweets person, but around the holidays, fudge, you know how it is folks, hot cocoa, it's just, since I was a kid, the only time I tend to eat a lot of sweets is maybe at birthday parties or around Christmas, and I just picked out this year.
[02:23:34.582 --> 02:23:36.123]  In fact, I was going to stop the experiment.
[02:23:36.143 --> 02:23:37.364]  I thought, well, this just isn't fair.
[02:23:37.384 --> 02:23:39.847]  I mean, I'm eating way more and working out less.
[02:23:40.787 --> 02:23:44.650]  This isn't going to happen, but we went ahead and did the experiment and I still lost some weight.
[02:23:45.290 --> 02:24:01.740]  It wasn't as much as I'd wanted to, but to me it proves the fact that again, metabolically, the things that God's given us through nature and having the good halogen and all the other things that are in the products in me helped me just lose weight while I was actually eating more.
[02:24:02.201 --> 02:24:02.881]  It's hard to believe.
[02:24:02.901 --> 02:24:05.643]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[02:24:05.923 --> 02:24:08.605]  Go read the five star reviews for yourself.
[02:24:10.585 --> 02:24:15.347]  Federal agents!
[02:24:16.367 --> 02:24:18.948]  We are armed!
[02:24:20.388 --> 02:24:28.871]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:28.911 --> 02:24:33.893]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Craig Richardson with Energy and Environment Legal.
[02:24:34.313 --> 02:24:35.794]  That's E-E-Legal.org.
[02:24:36.874 --> 02:24:45.480]  We talked in the last segment about how he mentioned how George Soros went in and bought coal stocks after Barack Obama collapsed that industry.
[02:24:46.060 --> 02:24:54.707]  Also, Elon Musk is getting massive subsidies at your expense if you buy a car that isn't an electric car, that he gets those carbon credits.
[02:24:55.107 --> 02:25:01.451]  But there's another crony capitalist that's at the bottom of all this, and that's what I wanted Craig to break down for us in this segment here.
[02:25:01.471 --> 02:25:06.055]  And that's a report that came from his organization, The Rockefeller Way.
[02:25:06.815 --> 02:25:12.637]  The family's covert climate change plan, because we need to understand what's really behind all this.
[02:25:12.897 --> 02:25:15.218]  Break that down for us, Craig.
[02:25:15.498 --> 02:25:17.519]  What is the Rockefellers' involvement in this?
[02:25:18.419 --> 02:25:20.520]  Well, you know, dealing with the Rockefellers is a little hard.
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:23.481]  There is an expression from history you probably recall.
[02:25:24.361 --> 02:25:27.062]  During the Roman Empire, they would say, all roads lead to Rome.
[02:25:27.782 --> 02:25:32.824]  Well, in the United States, really over the last 100 years, when you're dealing with any major
[02:25:33.484 --> 02:25:40.769]  Policy, whether it's health or pharmaceuticals or environment or energy, you can say that all roads lead to Rockefeller Plaza.
[02:25:41.229 --> 02:25:44.271]  In some shape, way or form, these people have been involved.
[02:25:44.811 --> 02:25:45.632]  Early on, J.D.
[02:25:45.672 --> 02:25:49.975]  Rockefeller got involved with social movements because everybody knew what a, you know, S.O.B.
[02:25:50.035 --> 02:25:50.415]  he was.
[02:25:50.875 --> 02:25:56.379]  So he had a PR guy essentially said, you need to start giving more to philanthropy and his other
[02:25:57.199 --> 02:26:05.841]  Guys as well did the same thing, but what they learned very quickly early on was that you could use those social movements as a way to open up markets for yourself, to drive policy.
[02:26:05.861 --> 02:26:20.065]  I don't think there's any better example than to look at the United Nations, and if you scratch the surface there, you realize that it was the Rockefellers themselves that donated the land in Manhattan for this now international organization that gave them an international reach.
[02:26:20.145 --> 02:26:23.306]  All under the guise of doing good for the world, right?
[02:26:23.826 --> 02:26:26.689]  So this is basically their ammo for a long time.
[02:26:26.749 --> 02:26:31.653]  If you fast forward to the climate change, they were one of the early funders in the 80s.
[02:26:32.434 --> 02:26:39.800]  As you recall, at that time, it was called global warming, which was not to be confused with global cooling, which was about 10 years earlier.
[02:26:40.761 --> 02:26:43.123]  But in the 80s, they started pushing global warming.
[02:26:43.143 --> 02:26:44.384]  And then obviously, after 18 years of a
[02:26:46.305 --> 02:26:47.626]  Pause as they like to refer to it.
[02:26:47.806 --> 02:26:51.167]  They suddenly had to change gears and call it climate change, which is where we are now.
[02:26:51.207 --> 02:26:52.027]  So they got in early.
[02:26:52.067 --> 02:26:52.987]  They provided funding.
[02:26:53.027 --> 02:27:01.190]  Again, we talked a lot about the motives of what we've seen before in terms of them being able to control the markets, being able to understand which way things are going.
[02:27:01.690 --> 02:27:08.412]  But most specifically through, and the report covers this, through our Freedom of Information Act request,
[02:27:08.956 --> 02:27:30.630]  We discovered that back in a couple years ago, maybe four years ago, the Rockefeller Family Fund, which is one of their various social engineering groups, their foundations, held a meeting where they came up with a strategy of how they were going to essentially go after, starting with Exxon Mobil.
[02:27:30.671 --> 02:27:36.975]  And ironically, as those who may know, Exxon Mobil were two of the largest standard oil companies that got broken up.
[02:27:37.035 --> 02:27:38.516]  One was New Jersey, one was New York.
[02:27:40.057 --> 02:27:46.260]  So they decided they would try to do them, go after them, similar to the way the tobacco industry was attacked in the 90s.
[02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:49.941]  And in that meeting, they came up with a couple of strategy items.
[02:27:49.981 --> 02:27:53.723]  Number one, they were going to fund a chair at the Columbia School of Journalism.
[02:27:53.783 --> 02:27:57.665]  So they found this guy who fit the bill in terms of being a climate activist.
[02:27:57.685 --> 02:28:00.206]  They literally funded his program out of nothing.
[02:28:00.626 --> 02:28:05.289]  And he created this, through his young journalists, a investigatory report
[02:28:06.389 --> 02:28:12.511]  That showed Exxon knew sort of like the tobacco guys when they said, well, they knew tobacco was addictive, but they were hiding it.
[02:28:12.571 --> 02:28:15.312]  They said that you wanted that same mantra coming out of this.
[02:28:15.352 --> 02:28:20.434]  Well, Exxon knew that all of their fossil fuels were driving the temperatures up around the world.
[02:28:20.474 --> 02:28:25.756]  So we're going to go after them and shut them down and global settlements and the lawyers obviously started licking their chops.
[02:28:26.356 --> 02:28:27.137]  So that was one.
[02:28:27.157 --> 02:28:27.757]  Get Columbia
[02:28:28.457 --> 02:28:31.098]  To fund that, and to do a report, which they did.
[02:28:31.498 --> 02:28:40.903]  Then, once the report was done, they used another group that they fund called Inside Climate News, which has a bunch of old reporters from, you know, Blue Chip
[02:28:42.563 --> 02:28:44.404]  Papers like the Washington Post and L.A.
[02:28:44.444 --> 02:28:47.345]  Times, but you know, obviously activists, sixties types.
[02:28:47.905 --> 02:28:53.067]  And so they came out, you know, with this releasing this report and this breaking news and then L.A.
[02:28:53.127 --> 02:28:54.027]  Times covered it.
[02:28:54.327 --> 02:28:59.089]  So next thing you know, you've got the echo chamber working saying the scandal breaks of Exxon knew.
[02:28:59.109 --> 02:29:07.452]  And then the last piece of this strategy that the Rockefellers developed in their own boardroom was that they needed to find a sympathetic
[02:29:08.272 --> 02:29:17.621]  Attorney General who could then use the prosecutorial powers that he has as an AG at a state level to basically go after Exxon.
[02:29:18.282 --> 02:29:25.269]  And actually not only Exxon, but what really became nefarious is they started going after groups like Competitive Enterprise Institute.
[02:29:25.369 --> 02:29:29.553]  Anybody that Exxon had donated to, they suddenly wanted to go after and shut up.
[02:29:30.390 --> 02:29:39.973]  And they didn't have to go very far because they found this activist, AG, in New York, Eric Schneiderman, and he took the bait, or he took the... He took the, uh... The incentive.
[02:29:40.213 --> 02:29:40.453]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:29:40.773 --> 02:29:42.214]  Well, I wish we had more time.
[02:29:42.254 --> 02:29:45.215]  We're out of time, and if you want to see, we just scratched the surface.
[02:29:45.255 --> 02:29:48.115]  Craig Richardson, President of Energy and Environment.
[02:29:48.155 --> 02:29:51.997]  If you want to see the rest of that report, right, you can see that at eelegal.org.
[02:29:52.037 --> 02:29:52.737]  Is that correct, Craig?
[02:29:53.377 --> 02:29:53.977]  Absolutely.
[02:29:54.177 --> 02:29:56.158]  That's a very important report to read.
[02:29:56.258 --> 02:29:59.479]  There's more information there than we could ever possibly cover on the show.
[02:30:00.019 --> 02:30:01.340]  Go there and get that information.
[02:30:01.540 --> 02:30:02.540]  Thank you so much, Craig.
[02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:06.282]  Thanks for having me.
[02:30:10.583 --> 02:30:16.745]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[02:30:17.385 --> 02:30:18.706]  The answer is, it's a minefield.
[02:30:19.625 --> 02:30:21.506]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[02:30:22.106 --> 02:30:27.687]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[02:30:28.247 --> 02:30:36.229]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[02:30:36.669 --> 02:30:38.710]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[02:30:39.010 --> 02:30:40.210]  This is the best system out there.
[02:30:40.470 --> 02:30:43.231]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[02:30:43.491 --> 02:30:44.211]  This is how it works.
[02:30:44.511 --> 02:30:45.032]  You order.
[02:30:45.152 --> 02:30:45.952]  Customized or
[02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:48.521]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[02:30:49.002 --> 02:30:52.164]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[02:30:52.465 --> 02:30:56.508]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[02:30:56.748 --> 02:30:57.509]  You cannot lose.
[02:30:57.549 --> 02:30:58.630]  You're funding the Infowar.
[02:30:58.950 --> 02:31:05.675]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[02:31:06.016 --> 02:31:09.959]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[02:31:20.245 --> 02:31:28.175]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:28.235 --> 02:31:31.319]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[02:31:32.128 --> 02:31:33.989]  And they're also very affordable.
[02:31:56.135 --> 02:32:02.871]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us and it's changed my life and it's also helped the InfoWar change the country and the world.
[02:32:03.272 --> 02:32:04.033]  It's a win-win.
[02:32:04.514 --> 02:32:05.296]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:10.728 --> 02:32:12.489]  Here's Donald Trump on Twitter today.
[02:32:12.509 --> 02:32:14.070]  Now, here is Rosie O'Donnell on Twitter.
[02:32:36.207 --> 02:32:43.293]  I fully support imposing martial law, delaying the inauguration, until Trump is cleared of all charges!
[02:32:43.694 --> 02:32:46.056]  All her hearsay mafia minion followers agreed.
[02:32:46.396 --> 02:32:50.120]  The only problem with that is, there are no charges to be cleared!
[02:32:50.500 --> 02:32:52.582]  Just fake news allegations that you fall for.
[02:32:52.882 --> 02:32:54.704]  Remember her side of the fence before the election?
[02:32:54.844 --> 02:32:56.205]  When they go low, we go high?
[02:32:56.385 --> 02:32:58.367]  Trump and Republicans need to accept the results?
[02:32:58.587 --> 02:32:59.268]  So much for that.
[02:32:59.488 --> 02:33:00.689]  Two things were confirmed today.
[02:33:00.829 --> 02:33:05.033]  Trump on Twitter is awesome, and Rosie O'Donnell is a hypocritical wine bag moron.
[02:33:05.193 --> 02:33:06.354]  Jabba the Hutt in the flesh.
[02:33:06.374 --> 02:33:08.696]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[02:33:20.566 --> 02:33:24.730]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:25.450 --> 02:33:26.912]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.205 --> 02:33:31.506]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:31.586 --> 02:33:32.246]  I'm David Knight.
[02:33:33.167 --> 02:33:35.788]  So your computer breaks and you take it to get it fixed.
[02:33:36.608 --> 02:33:47.674]  Do you know that the government is using tech company employees as paid informants to spy on you when you take your computer there?
[02:33:47.694 --> 02:33:50.276]  Of course, they're always looking.
[02:33:50.576 --> 02:33:51.936]  This is the world that we live in.
[02:33:51.996 --> 02:33:52.837]  Who would have thought?
[02:33:53.891 --> 02:34:00.196]  That we would become far, far worse than the East German Stasi police in this country.
[02:34:00.216 --> 02:34:05.060]  And of course, that was an analogy not just coming from me, that's coming from William Binney.
[02:34:05.754 --> 02:34:23.349]  The former technical head of the NSA and he talked about how he spent his entire career watching the police and surveillance states in the Soviet Union in East Germany and said that what we have here is far more extensive than the Stasi ever was.
[02:34:23.390 --> 02:34:30.135]  We've got a report by Joe Biggs that's coming up in just one moment before I throw to that report I want to remind you that we have put a lot of

[02:35:12.842 --> 02:35:13.282]  My favorite
[02:35:17.899 --> 02:35:20.380]  Uh, subsidy, uh, supplement that we have here.
[02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:22.341]  Subsidy, my favorite supplement that we have here.
[02:35:22.741 --> 02:35:42.268]  That is, as I point out many times, one of the things that I feel right away, but as I pointed out, when I get out of my habit of taking supplements on a daily basis, as I do Monday through Friday, on weekends, or as I take a vacation over the holidays, that's when I really noticed it at the end of this year, when it's like, wow, you know, I really don't have the energy or the focus or the concentration.
[02:35:42.828 --> 02:35:44.990]  I do when I'm taking this stuff on a daily basis.
[02:35:45.030 --> 02:35:48.353]  That's why it's important for you to set up a habit.
[02:35:48.813 --> 02:35:53.297]  And this is a good time for you to create new, positive, healthy habits.
[02:35:53.737 --> 02:35:57.340]  And one of the ways that you can do that is to set yourself up for AutoShip.
[02:35:57.360 --> 02:36:03.746]  Decide what supplements you want to take on a regular basis, what works for you, what you need to do for yourself.
[02:36:03.766 --> 02:36:08.530]  You can read the reviews at InfoWarsLife.com and you can sign up for AutoShip and you can get
[02:36:09.130 --> 02:36:12.513]  Guaranteed delivery on all these items and make sure they never run out of stock.
[02:36:12.533 --> 02:36:14.355]  We just ran out of stock on DNA Force.
[02:36:14.375 --> 02:36:15.436]  We were out for over a month.
[02:36:16.117 --> 02:36:18.239]  We've gotten that back in with an emergency shipment.
[02:36:18.319 --> 02:36:20.401]  Once that's out, it may be out for months.
[02:36:21.121 --> 02:36:23.904]  But we've put it in for people, even people who are not on auto ship.
[02:36:23.944 --> 02:36:29.469]  You can get that for 10% discount as a thank you and because it's been out of stock for a while.
[02:36:30.450 --> 02:36:33.931]  But you can always get a 10% discount if you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:36:34.431 --> 02:36:44.495]  And if you have more than $50 on your, you pick the interval that you want, the products that you want shipped to you, and if that shipment is more than $50, you'll even get it with free shipping.
[02:36:44.555 --> 02:36:50.537]  Make sure that you never run out of the items that you want to make a habit in your daily life.
[02:36:51.057 --> 02:36:52.797]  Let's go to this report now from Joe Biggs.
[02:36:52.817 --> 02:36:57.219]  The government is using tech company employees as paid informants.
[02:36:58.968 --> 02:36:59.769]  What's going on everybody?
[02:36:59.809 --> 02:37:01.952]  This is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:37:01.972 --> 02:37:06.097]  Now today I want to cover an article that I saw from TechDirt.com.
[02:37:06.297 --> 02:37:15.048]  Now in this article it says that the FBI is apparently paying Geek Squad members to dig around people's computers for evidence of criminal activity.
[02:37:15.729 --> 02:37:20.431]  So when I give you my computer, you're not supposed to be just going through my computer.
[02:37:20.451 --> 02:37:23.411]  You're supposed to be trying to fix the issues at hand.
[02:37:23.852 --> 02:37:33.014]  Now, if you do stumble across something accidentally, say child pornography, which is where this article does end up going, then they're supposed to notify proper authorities.
[02:37:33.575 --> 02:37:37.496]  But you're not supposed to be getting a paycheck from the FBI for doing that.
[02:37:37.936 --> 02:37:40.997]  And that's an issue that's happening here with this article.
[02:37:41.846 --> 02:38:03.200]  Now according to court records, Geek Squad technician John Trey Westfall was an FBI informant and reported he accidentally located on Wright and Myers, I guess this is the guy who submitted his computer in to be looked at, an image of a fully nude prepubescent female on her hands and knees on a bed, fully nude with a choker around her neck.
[02:38:04.581 --> 02:38:15.089]  This guy was an FBI informant who notified another man who was an FBI informant, who alerted a colleague, Randall Ratliff, who was another FBI informant.
[02:38:15.489 --> 02:38:26.038]  And then eventually it got to the FBI, and this guy was apparently tied to a series of illicit pictures called the Jenny Shots.
[02:38:26.258 --> 02:38:30.822]  Agent Tracy Riley seized that hard drive and submitted it into the FBI.
[02:38:31.656 --> 02:38:33.817]  Now, it's not that big of a deal.
[02:38:33.857 --> 02:38:46.603]  Like I said before, it is a customary practice by people who work in computer electronic device repair that if they stumble across child pornography that they are supposed to
[02:38:47.887 --> 02:38:48.267]  Notify
[02:39:05.242 --> 02:39:23.174]  Houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable search and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.
[02:39:23.795 --> 02:39:31.020]  The ultimate goal of this provision is to protect people's right to privacy and freedom for arbitrary governmental intrusions.
[02:39:32.810 --> 02:39:46.666]  Now, setting aside the issue of whether the search of Rattenheimer's computer constituted an illegal search by private individuals acting as government agents, the FBI undertook a series of dishonest measures in hopes of building a case.
[02:39:47.107 --> 02:39:51.411]  Now, according to James Z. Redditt, Rattenheimer's San Clemente-based defense lawyer,
[02:39:52.172 --> 02:40:07.123]  Reddit says agents conducted two additional searches of the computer without obtaining warrants, lied to trick a federal magistrate judge into authorizing a search warrant, then tried to cover up their misdeeds by initially hiding records.
[02:40:07.744 --> 02:40:13.008]  So that's the issue, is that instead of going through the law and using it the proper way,
[02:40:13.388 --> 02:40:13.668]  I don't
[02:40:33.391 --> 02:40:33.531]  I don't
[02:40:49.978 --> 02:40:52.539]  One computer and then it turns into all computers.
[02:40:52.599 --> 02:41:02.503]  Look what Edward Snowden brought to the forefront with his revelations in The Guardian showing how Verizon was helping the US government spy on its users.
[02:41:03.083 --> 02:41:12.746]  Look at General Petraeus talking about how in the future, you know, your washing machine or your your microwave or refrigerator will be listening to your conversations.
[02:41:12.786 --> 02:41:16.628]  We now have a new thing by Amazon called Alexa.
[02:41:17.068 --> 02:41:20.191]  That is a device that sits in your room and can listen to you.
[02:41:20.511 --> 02:41:31.200]  There has to be a line drawn in the sand when it comes to what these tech companies can do as far as their involvement with helping the government spy on its citizens.
[02:41:31.901 --> 02:41:40.308]  Like I said, we have a Fourth Amendment that clearly states that without a warrant or without reasonable suspicion, you cannot illegally seize
[02:41:40.888 --> 02:41:44.710]  Or search or go through any of my property, that being my home.
[02:41:44.750 --> 02:41:50.253]  You can't go through my car and you can't go through my laptop computer because you think something.
[02:41:50.653 --> 02:41:54.435]  You actually have to have some kind of evidence to allow that to happen.
[02:41:54.935 --> 02:42:04.480]  And we've seen how Dell is apparently having their computers intercepted by the NSA so they can install malware to spy on more people.
[02:42:04.900 --> 02:42:08.042]  More and more, it looks like we're living in a scene from the book of 1984.
[02:42:10.263 --> 02:42:19.447]  Hopefully, on January 20th, President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, and he will help us straighten this up.
[02:42:19.788 --> 02:42:22.169]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:38.584]  Senator Sessions, as he becomes Attorney General, and I think he will pass that with flying colors, but we'll have to see if he passes the other test.
[02:42:38.604 --> 02:42:40.504]  Will he respect the Fourth Amendment?
[02:42:40.524 --> 02:42:43.305]  Will he roll back these structures that have been put in place?
[02:42:43.345 --> 02:42:47.347]  And of course, as Rand Paul pointed out, the FISA Court has become the rubber stamp for this.
[02:42:47.407 --> 02:42:53.209]  They go in and they say that they're going to a court to get a search warrant, but they go in and get a search warrant from Mr. and Mrs. Verizon.
[02:42:53.649 --> 02:42:55.010]  That's not what the Fourth Amendment is about.
[02:42:55.575 --> 02:42:56.955]  The Fourth Amendment makes it very clear.
[02:42:57.015 --> 02:43:02.497]  You're coming in to get information about a particular person at a particular place.
[02:43:02.537 --> 02:43:04.497]  You're looking for something in particular.
[02:43:05.517 --> 02:43:07.398]  All of those were very, very particular about that.
[02:43:07.438 --> 02:43:09.178]  But of course, they've used FISA.
[02:43:09.198 --> 02:43:17.740]  FISA was created, interestingly enough, because we had the phone companies like AT&T spying back in the 1970s for the NSA and the CIA on American people.
[02:43:18.496 --> 02:43:21.317]  And that was exposed by the Church Committee hearings, by the Pike Committee hearings.
[02:43:21.677 --> 02:43:23.117]  That was why they created FISA.
[02:43:23.237 --> 02:43:31.599]  Yet now they use that thing that was to stop them from doing that to enable them to do it, as a beard to enable them to do it.
[02:43:31.639 --> 02:43:32.979]  The same way they're using the Constitution.
[02:43:32.999 --> 02:43:35.680]  The Constitution was put in place to keep them from abusing our rights.
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:42.001]  Now they take an oath to the Constitution and they say, well, I've got the authority of office now because I took an oath to a Constitution.
[02:43:42.631 --> 02:43:45.193]  And they ignore the Constitution, just like they ignore the FISA Act.
[02:43:45.493 --> 02:43:48.876]  And of course, a key part of this is the third-party involvement.
[02:43:49.276 --> 02:44:01.625]  That's why they worked so hard with CISPA twice, with ACTA, with PIPA, and then they got CISA, finally passed through, so that you can't sue third parties for turning over information about you.
[02:44:02.304 --> 02:44:05.768]  One of the other fights we're going to have here, of course, is the ethics fight.
[02:44:05.868 --> 02:44:10.313]  And there's going to be this push going back and forth about conflict of interest.
[02:44:10.333 --> 02:44:14.658]  That's going to be a continuing fight that the left is going to use against Donald Trump.
[02:44:14.698 --> 02:44:22.106]  We had Representative Jason Chaffetz, the head of the House Oversight Committee, criticize the director of the Federal Office of Government Ethics.
[02:44:22.526 --> 02:44:26.631]  Yesterday, over his criticism of Trump's plan to address conflict of interest.
[02:44:26.671 --> 02:44:36.202]  And quite frankly, I thought that Trump went way beyond what was necessary, what was required, both legally and ethically, to handle his very complex businesses.
[02:44:36.282 --> 02:44:41.247]  But this is what Chaffetz says about the comments from the Office of Government Ethics.
[02:44:42.133 --> 02:44:44.334]  This individual seems to be acting prematurely at best.
[02:44:44.374 --> 02:44:48.136]  He's rendering opinions publicly that really cause you to scratch your head.
[02:44:48.636 --> 02:44:51.858]  We need the Office of Government Ethics to act ethically.
[02:44:52.198 --> 02:44:53.658]  Ironically, that's not what they're doing.
[02:44:53.698 --> 02:44:59.421]  Now this guy that came out and criticized Donald Trump's plan is an appointee of Gesu, Barack Obama.
[02:44:59.441 --> 02:45:01.042]  See, it's all back to politics.
[02:45:01.402 --> 02:45:05.644]  He's been a frequent critic of the incoming administration's ethics plans, peaking
[02:45:06.324 --> 02:45:10.968]  Wednesday, when he called Trump's newly unveiled conflicts of interest policy meaningless.
[02:45:11.609 --> 02:45:14.351]  Now this is from Politico, even, that's coming out.
[02:45:14.651 --> 02:45:18.935]  The plan does not comport, he said, with the tradition of our presidents over the last 40 years.
[02:45:18.955 --> 02:45:19.195]  Really?
[02:45:19.215 --> 02:45:21.497]  Well, you know, we have a very long tradition.
[02:45:21.557 --> 02:45:28.183]  It goes back to people like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who kept their businesses, who didn't have to sell them because we decided at that time.
[02:45:28.783 --> 02:45:36.692]  That we didn't want to simply have people who were going to be professional politicians, who were going to remain in Washington and be lobbyists.
[02:45:36.772 --> 02:45:38.875]  And that's another part of what Donald Trump has done.
[02:45:38.935 --> 02:45:45.822]  And yet we have, he came up with his ethics plan to say we're going to ban lobbying from people who have been in the government.
[02:45:46.463 --> 02:45:48.425]  For not one year, but for five years.
[02:45:48.505 --> 02:45:50.626]  And so immediately Paul Ryan speaks out on that.
[02:45:50.686 --> 02:45:51.667]  He doesn't like that idea.
[02:45:52.127 --> 02:45:54.109]  He's one of the guys in charge of the swamp.
[02:45:54.389 --> 02:45:55.330]  He doesn't want it drained.
[02:45:55.670 --> 02:45:58.112]  He said this proposal, he said, is dangerous.
[02:45:58.752 --> 02:46:01.174]  He said there are unforeseen circumstances in this.
[02:46:01.474 --> 02:46:03.075]  And listen to the example that he gives.
[02:46:03.115 --> 02:46:03.416]  He says,
[02:46:04.016 --> 02:46:06.878]  What if he wanted to become an advocate for the Cancer Society?
[02:46:06.918 --> 02:46:08.480]  Then you couldn't do that under Donald Trump.
[02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:14.985]  And it's like, oh yeah, that's what these guys have been doing after they leave the Senate and the House and go to K Street.
[02:46:15.245 --> 02:46:17.607]  They've been searching for a cure for cancer.
[02:46:19.822 --> 02:46:21.083]  Uh, I don't think so.
[02:46:21.303 --> 02:46:31.409]  And then he goes on to say this, I don't think we should tell men and women that we want a citizen legislature, take time out of your private life, come and serve, and then go back into private life, and you can't get engaged in civics.
[02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.350]  Okay?
[02:46:32.770 --> 02:46:38.173]  Because to him, civics and government means lobbying for cash.
[02:46:38.694 --> 02:46:41.015]  That's what is really happening in Washington.
[02:46:41.155 --> 02:46:43.217]  It's absolutely amazing when we see that.
[02:46:43.357 --> 02:46:44.918]  And you know when we go back and we look at this.
[02:46:45.788 --> 02:47:11.055]  And I look at these last couple days, we've mentioned this a couple times yesterday, the EPA and all these last-minute regulations that they're putting out there and we just talked to Craig Richardson with Energy and Environment Legal and he was talking about how George Soros went in and got the bankrupted stocks of coal companies at a discounted price after Obama said I'm going to bankrupt that industry and now we have every single day for the last couple of days we've had the EPA coming in
[02:47:11.835 --> 02:47:12.015]  I don't
[02:47:29.777 --> 02:47:35.861]  Terry Gilliam movie, the Monty Python movie, Meaning of Life Part 2, you know, where they have these corporate raider pirates.
[02:47:35.881 --> 02:47:37.102]  I mean, that's what DPA did.
[02:47:37.142 --> 02:47:44.647]  They went in and they arrested VW's executives, and now Volkswagen is warning their managers, don't come to the US!
[02:47:45.523 --> 02:47:48.446]  You'll be kidnapped by the EPA and held for ransom.
[02:47:48.806 --> 02:47:51.809]  And we just paid $4.3 billion to get this one guy out.
[02:47:51.829 --> 02:47:53.810]  They're going to arrest you as well if you go there.
[02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:54.671]  I mean, that's what's happening.
[02:47:54.691 --> 02:47:57.894]  But this may also be golden parachutes for these crooks.
[02:47:58.735 --> 02:48:01.477]  Remember we had the Stock Act when they caught Congress?
[02:48:01.877 --> 02:48:03.659]  And they said, well, you know, that doesn't really apply to us.
[02:48:03.699 --> 02:48:04.760]  We can do insider trading.
[02:48:05.020 --> 02:48:08.403]  We know if we're going to tank somebody with our laws, with our regulations,
[02:48:09.564 --> 02:48:11.165]  I wonder if that's the sort of thing that's going on.
[02:48:11.185 --> 02:48:31.891]  Boy, if you want an ethics investigation, somebody out there needs to go through this and make sure that nobody at the EPA, at Obama's EPA, is profiting off of them tanking one major corporation after another with threats of investigating their emissions tests.
[02:48:32.391 --> 02:48:35.792]  Okay, that's what I suspect something like that is really happening.
[02:48:36.380 --> 02:48:38.742]  Now I want to go to a report from John Bowne.
[02:48:38.762 --> 02:48:41.303]  He did a report talking about Obama's last speech.
[02:48:41.323 --> 02:48:44.826]  He goes to Chicago, where there is literally a war going on.
[02:48:44.846 --> 02:48:49.469]  About 4,000 people have died there in their gun-free killing zones that they've created.
[02:48:49.789 --> 02:48:52.331]  And he goes back there to give his farewell speech.
[02:48:52.351 --> 02:48:53.372]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[02:48:54.435 --> 02:49:09.841]  After eight years of enduring President Barack Obama's rampant hypocrisy, his final speech was nothing less than the great conclusion to the hyper-normalization that characterized his presidency.
[02:49:10.081 --> 02:49:16.384]  You can tell that... You can tell that I'm lamed up because nobody's following instructions.
[02:49:17.004 --> 02:49:22.226]  If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse the Great Recession,
[02:49:23.590 --> 02:49:29.975]  Reboot our auto industry and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history.
[02:49:35.419 --> 02:49:47.447]  If I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9-11,
[02:49:52.006 --> 02:50:02.672]  If I had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens.
[02:50:05.534 --> 02:50:10.857]  If I had told you all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high.
[02:50:14.759 --> 02:50:15.699]  But that's what we did.
[02:50:16.920 --> 02:50:19.982]  After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America.
[02:50:22.583 --> 02:50:27.985]  And such a vision, however well intended, was never realistic.
[02:50:30.406 --> 02:50:35.427]  Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.
[02:50:37.748 --> 02:50:46.631]  Now, I've lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say.
[02:50:48.012 --> 02:50:51.853]  You can see it, not just in statistics,
[02:50:53.288 --> 02:50:55.609]  You see it in the attitudes of young Americans across America.
[02:50:55.689 --> 02:50:56.669]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:50:56.929 --> 02:51:01.531]  If only we had enough time to play the full 75 minutes for you, but there is about a five minute report.
[02:51:01.551 --> 02:51:03.372]  You can see that on Alex Jones' channel.
[02:51:03.912 --> 02:51:07.453]  The hypocrisy of Obama's last speech by John Bowne.
[02:51:07.513 --> 02:51:09.234]  Don't let the door hit you on the way out, O.
[02:51:10.450 --> 02:51:16.292]  Wars are not cheap, and a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[02:51:16.972 --> 02:51:19.773]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[02:51:20.313 --> 02:51:21.334]  I believe in the Renaissance.
[02:51:21.474 --> 02:51:22.834]  That's why I harp on it constantly.
[02:51:23.434 --> 02:51:30.236]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[02:51:30.596 --> 02:51:34.918]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[02:51:35.538 --> 02:51:44.663]  That's why on major third party sites we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[02:51:45.564 --> 02:51:57.250]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically and try to free this republic and the world.
[02:51:57.671 --> 02:51:59.352]  We apply to the products we bring in.
[02:52:00.248 --> 02:52:06.613]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[02:52:07.213 --> 02:52:11.576]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[02:52:11.596 --> 02:52:12.877]  I think 7 or 8 have sold out.
[02:52:13.197 --> 02:52:15.359]  More are coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've...
[02:52:15.979 --> 02:52:16.300]  I think so.
[02:52:33.962 --> 02:52:35.203]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[02:52:35.623 --> 02:52:36.623]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[02:52:36.643 --> 02:52:38.264]  I dedicated myself to working out.
[02:52:38.304 --> 02:52:38.904]  I was in great shape.
[02:52:38.924 --> 02:52:40.025]  I've been dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[02:52:40.045 --> 02:52:45.127]  Gained a lot of weight, but I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[02:52:45.307 --> 02:52:46.928]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[02:52:46.948 --> 02:52:49.529]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[02:52:49.710 --> 02:52:54.472]  Now it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[02:52:55.072 --> 02:53:04.842]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, bio-PQQ, you name it.
[02:53:04.862 --> 02:53:05.683]  170-plus studies.
[02:53:05.703 --> 02:53:06.704]  We can make claims on this.
[02:53:06.724 --> 02:53:12.791]  This thing is like the Holy Grail, basically, of nerve regrowth, detoxification, antioxidant.
[02:53:13.571 --> 02:53:15.372]  I've got this at my fingertips, at cost.
[02:53:15.452 --> 02:53:16.232]  I forget to take it.
[02:53:16.252 --> 02:53:17.193]  I forget to give it to my kids.
[02:53:17.233 --> 02:53:19.073]  I forget to, you know, push it on my parents.
[02:53:19.153 --> 02:53:21.334]  This is God's gift to us through nature.
[02:53:21.795 --> 02:53:22.355]  Well, guess what?
[02:53:22.395 --> 02:53:23.615]  DNA Force is coming back in.
[02:53:24.016 --> 02:53:24.596]  It's discounted.
[02:53:24.876 --> 02:53:27.897]  Now, in the next few weeks, a lot of these products that have sold out are coming back in.
[02:53:27.917 --> 02:53:29.338]  A lot of the products we have left
[02:53:29.878 --> 02:53:34.642]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[02:53:35.022 --> 02:53:39.766]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.

[02:53:55.578 --> 02:53:59.344]  You are literally energizing this operation against the global assault.
[02:53:59.364 --> 02:54:07.577]  I want to, again, salute you all and ask you to go check out the amazing specials we've got running right now for 2017 in the month of January.
[02:54:07.797 --> 02:54:08.879]  Make our bodies great again.
[02:54:23.914 --> 02:54:25.214]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:25.254 --> 02:54:25.894]  I'm David Knight.
[02:54:26.715 --> 02:54:31.255]  We were just looking at Obama's last speech that he made in Chirac.
[02:54:31.275 --> 02:54:32.696]  That's what a lot of people call it.
[02:54:32.796 --> 02:54:35.536]  Kind of a combination of Chicago and Iraq.
[02:54:36.236 --> 02:54:47.778]  An acknowledgment of the fact that they have so many murders in the gun-free killing zones that have been created by the Democrats' policies there.
[02:54:47.838 --> 02:54:51.719]  That they've had as many, about 4,000 people die there over the eight years of Barack Obama.
[02:54:52.827 --> 02:54:58.570]  About the same number they've had that died during the Iraq and Afghanistan War under George W. Bush.
[02:54:58.590 --> 02:55:07.615]  You know, if I lived in that area, I would want to have some kind of protection for myself, and I'm sure that the liberals will next be trying to take away, as Lionel pointed out.
[02:55:07.935 --> 02:55:15.679]  I talked about our body armor yesterday, and Lionel said, you know, get it while you can, because if you can protect yourself with it, they'll probably try to ban it.
[02:55:15.779 --> 02:55:20.982]  And we've had bills introduced in certain areas already by Democrats trying to outlaw body armor.
[02:55:21.696 --> 02:55:22.176]  It's coming.
[02:55:22.436 --> 02:55:22.896]  Don't worry.
[02:55:23.096 --> 02:55:23.497]  It's coming.
[02:55:23.777 --> 02:55:25.877]  They don't want you to be able to protect yourself at all.
[02:55:26.757 --> 02:55:33.900]  Not with a gun, and not even with something that can't harm anybody, that is simply passive, simply defensive, and that is body armor.
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:44.863]  Again, we've put together a line of a patented form of carbon nanotube technology, the lightest, strongest, most flexible body armor on the market, even though it's only a quarter of an inch thick.
[02:55:45.323 --> 02:55:48.964]  It is field tested to stop the most powerful pistol rounds in production.
[02:55:49.364 --> 02:55:49.965]  It's waterproof.
[02:55:50.025 --> 02:55:50.905]  It's super lightweight.
[02:55:50.965 --> 02:55:51.646]  It's made in the U.S.
[02:55:51.706 --> 02:55:53.547]  It comes with a 20-year warranty.
[02:55:53.948 --> 02:55:57.210]  You can find that at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:55:57.670 --> 02:56:00.833]  In the past, this has only been available to the U.S.
[02:56:00.873 --> 02:56:02.354]  military and law enforcement.
[02:56:02.434 --> 02:56:04.756]  It is state-of-the-art in body armor.
[02:56:04.796 --> 02:56:08.679]  This isn't real heavy metal plates that are going to weigh you down.
[02:56:08.799 --> 02:56:11.381]  And you can get it, as I pointed out, in just an insert.
[02:56:11.841 --> 02:56:17.745]  They can go into your backpack to protect yourself at airports or when you're traveling or to protect your kids when they're going to school.
[02:56:17.825 --> 02:56:19.586]  A lot of kids take backpacks.
[02:56:19.626 --> 02:56:29.513]  You can put that in there when they're traveling to school in case somebody decides to attack them and they don't allow any adults to carry weapons to protect the kids there at the school.
[02:56:29.553 --> 02:56:32.675]  That's a very important thing to do for you and for your family.
[02:56:32.715 --> 02:56:36.157]  And of course that insert is the cheapest part of the body armor.
[02:56:36.177 --> 02:56:40.780]  You can get that for just $200 and you can find that again at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:56:42.222 --> 02:56:58.639]  One of the interesting stories that came up today I thought was Julian Assange, of course the founder of WikiLeaks, he has agreed and gone publicly saying to Barack Obama, if you will release whistleblower Chelsea Manning, I will turn myself over to you.
[02:56:59.375 --> 02:57:03.618]  He says, if Obama grants Manning clemency, Assange will agree to U.S.
[02:57:03.739 --> 02:57:08.682]  extradition despite the clear unconstitutionality of the Department of Justice case.
[02:57:08.923 --> 02:57:10.744]  That's what WikiLeaks tweeted out.
[02:57:11.425 --> 02:57:12.566]  And that's just a reminder.
[02:57:13.519 --> 02:57:15.500]  Of another one of the legacies of Barack Obama.
[02:57:16.180 --> 02:57:25.184]  The fact that he has prosecuted whistleblowers and journalists under the 100-year-old Espionage Act of 1917.
[02:57:25.224 --> 02:57:30.667]  He has done that more than all the other presidents over the last 100 years combined.
[02:57:31.327 --> 02:57:40.031]  And remember, we talked to Thomas Drake, one of the NSA whistleblowers, and these are people who right after the Patriot Act was done, immediately following the 9-11 attack,
[02:57:41.892 --> 02:57:49.017]  They came out and said, with William Binney and Thomas Drake and others, they came out and said, we don't like what the government is doing.
[02:57:49.037 --> 02:57:51.959]  You're doing dragnet surveillance of the American people.
[02:57:52.039 --> 02:57:57.223]  What Joe Biggs was just talking about in that report that we played at the bottom of the hour.
[02:57:57.643 --> 02:57:59.564]  You're doing dragnet surveillance of the American people.
[02:57:59.604 --> 02:58:01.466]  William Binney and Thomas Drake and others said, we
[02:58:02.290 --> 02:58:05.011]  Take our oath to the Constitution very seriously.
[02:58:05.432 --> 02:58:08.033]  And you can do this without doing dragnet surveillance.
[02:58:08.073 --> 02:58:10.434]  As a matter of fact, they'd created software to do precisely that.
[02:58:10.474 --> 02:58:19.278]  But the government went with the people who had provided this as a private contractor, and they made a lot of money by doing that.
[02:58:19.338 --> 02:58:21.099]  I don't know if there were any kickbacks involved.
[02:58:21.159 --> 02:58:21.819]  Probably were.
[02:58:21.859 --> 02:58:27.302]  And yet, Thomas Drake was never prosecuted by the Bush administration.
[02:58:27.962 --> 02:58:31.324]  It was years later, almost 10 years later, when Barack Obama
[02:58:31.884 --> 02:58:33.485]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:00:01.024 --> 03:00:07.008]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:08.529 --> 03:00:23.459]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:24.060 --> 03:00:30.244]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:31.656 --> 03:00:34.237]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:34.277 --> 03:00:34.917]  I'm David Knight.
[03:00:35.717 --> 03:00:41.659]  In the next segment, fourth hour, we're going to have Leanne McAdoo and Owen Schroer are going to be joining us to host the fourth hour.
[03:00:42.339 --> 03:00:49.282]  In this last segment, I want to talk a little bit about the CDC and also about the issues that we see with RFK Jr.
[03:00:49.362 --> 03:00:57.504]  crossing the lines to work with Donald Trump on a very important issue, and that is the abuses of the CDC, specifically towards vaccines.
[03:00:58.284 --> 03:00:59.785]  He was very critical of the CDC.
[03:01:00.825 --> 03:01:03.427]  In terms of vaccines and what they're mandating to people.
[03:01:03.487 --> 03:01:24.679]  And also, at the same time, we see Allison Young, who works for USA Today, she's done a series of reports on the problems with biological operations, biological warfare, what they're developing with that, and the lax safety at the labs where they're doing this, especially at the CDC's own labs.
[03:01:24.719 --> 03:01:27.001]  And as she's repeatedly pointed out, she's got another article here,
[03:01:27.541 --> 03:01:31.506]  The CDC keeps secret its mishaps with deadly germs.
[03:01:31.886 --> 03:01:44.520]  She said the CDC's facilities are among a small group of biolab operators that have the worst regulatory histories in the country, receiving repeated sanctions under federal regulations.
[03:01:44.601 --> 03:01:45.221]  Think about that.
[03:01:45.241 --> 03:01:46.222]  The CDC itself
[03:01:47.099 --> 03:01:51.343]  is among the worst of the safety of the biolab operators.
[03:01:51.523 --> 03:01:54.967]  She said they've faced congressional hearings, they've had secret government sanctions.
[03:01:55.247 --> 03:01:56.508]  Secret government sanctions!
[03:01:56.528 --> 03:02:01.793]  See, they don't want the public to know how dangerous they are and what they're doing.
[03:02:01.833 --> 03:02:10.562]  So if they're going to hide these problems that they have at their biolabs from you, do you think they would hide the problems that they have with vaccines when they have a profit motive in that?
[03:02:11.755 --> 03:02:12.856]  See, that's the issue here.
[03:02:12.936 --> 03:02:15.238]  What are they hiding from us on all these issues?
[03:02:15.278 --> 03:02:16.980]  They have sloppy safety practices.
[03:02:17.020 --> 03:02:24.386]  They keep secret large swaths of information about dozens of recent incidents involving some of the world's most dangerous bacteria and viruses.
[03:02:24.907 --> 03:02:31.032]  She said CDC scientists apparently lost a box of deadly and highly regulated influenza specimens.
[03:02:31.072 --> 03:02:31.693]  Here's the latest one.
[03:02:32.333 --> 03:02:40.795]  Experienced multiple potential exposures involving viruses and bacteria according to heavily redacted laboratory incident reports obtained by USA Today.
[03:02:40.835 --> 03:02:45.196]  See, even when you get in under a FOIA request, they redact most of the information that's in there.
[03:02:45.436 --> 03:02:47.596]  Several reports involve failures of safety equipment.
[03:02:47.857 --> 03:02:58.479]  In one, a scientist wearing full-body space suit-like gear to protect against lethal, often untreatable viruses like Ebola had their purified air connectors suddenly disconnect
[03:02:59.179 --> 03:03:03.583]  Again, in one of the world's most advanced biosafety level 4 labs.
[03:03:03.623 --> 03:03:06.887]  That's the most dangerous substances that they're controlling there.
[03:03:07.447 --> 03:03:18.438]  And so she said the CDC would not answer USA Today's questions about specific incidents which occurred at the agency's lab facilities in Atlanta and Fort Collins, Colorado from 2013 through 2015.
[03:03:18.918 --> 03:03:21.341]  Do you think maybe we need to audit the CDC?
[03:03:22.816 --> 03:03:25.297]  Not just the Fed, but the CDC.
[03:03:25.337 --> 03:03:26.537]  Yeah, of course they should be audited.
[03:03:26.577 --> 03:03:30.058]  We ought to audit all these pseudo-government organizations.
[03:03:30.138 --> 03:03:31.758]  They pretend to be government and they're private.
[03:03:32.118 --> 03:03:32.358]  Okay?
[03:03:32.598 --> 03:03:34.179]  Let's audit these people.
[03:03:34.199 --> 03:03:35.099]  Let's find out what's going on.
[03:03:35.359 --> 03:03:37.339]  Let's find out what's going on with the vaccine stuff.
[03:03:37.359 --> 03:03:38.219]  They're hiding this.
[03:03:38.480 --> 03:03:44.641]  They're messing around with Ebola at these Level 4 safety labs and then redacting the information, keeping it secret.
[03:03:44.721 --> 03:03:48.542]  Even though they're getting sanctioned and penalized by the Congress, they don't want you to know about it.
[03:03:49.642 --> 03:03:52.468]  I got this report handed to me from Kit Daniels.
[03:03:53.069 --> 03:03:59.421]  The Washington Post has got a report from the CDC and guess what they say the real threat to your health is?
[03:04:00.043 --> 03:04:01.085]  Living in the country!
[03:04:01.977 --> 03:04:03.277]  You should live in the city.
[03:04:03.797 --> 03:04:08.818]  You see, they say rural Americans are more likely to die from the top five causes of death.
[03:04:08.858 --> 03:04:14.720]  Here's the Washington Post dutifully reporting the propaganda from the globalist elite.
[03:04:15.220 --> 03:04:23.222]  The globalist elite who want you to be living in the cities, part of the Agenda 21, also selling you the climate change stuff, also selling you diesel gates.
[03:04:23.242 --> 03:04:24.642]  See, these are all interconnected.
[03:04:25.401 --> 03:04:31.726]  And they want to tell you that you're at more risk living in the country than you are living in the city.
[03:04:32.946 --> 03:04:33.807]  You know that's not true.
[03:04:34.448 --> 03:04:35.248]  That's never been true.
[03:04:36.069 --> 03:04:41.433]  There's Thomas Jefferson that said cities are a threat to the health, the wealth, and the liberty of mankind and nothing has changed.
[03:04:41.533 --> 03:04:43.254]  You know that from your own personal observations.
[03:04:43.314 --> 03:04:46.836]  And yet, you have all these people who are all together on this Agenda 21
[03:04:49.384 --> 03:04:50.665]  That they're pushing on everybody.
[03:04:51.126 --> 03:04:53.248]  People like the CEO of Lyft who is an urban planner.
[03:04:53.268 --> 03:04:56.431]  All the urban planners are telling you the cities are utopia.
[03:04:57.111 --> 03:05:02.456]  It's the suburbs and the rural areas that are bad and it's the cars that get you there that have to be shut down.
[03:05:02.797 --> 03:05:04.178]  You need to be staying in the cities.
[03:05:04.198 --> 03:05:08.002]  We need to take your transportation away and keep you confined in those cities for your own safety.
[03:05:16.886 --> 03:05:20.408]  Joining us now is John McAfee, and of course, John McAfee is no stranger to any of this.
[03:05:20.448 --> 03:05:21.989]  He's not naive about this.
[03:05:22.269 --> 03:05:26.871]  John created McAfee Associates back in 1987, 30 years ago.
[03:05:26.891 --> 03:05:28.732]  And you know, John, the U.S.
[03:05:28.772 --> 03:05:34.736]  government hasn't really done a very good job in protecting themselves or protecting us from cyber hacks in the interim years, have they?
[03:05:34.776 --> 03:05:40.058]  Even though you're now not part of the company, you sold this to Intel Corporation.
[03:05:40.319 --> 03:05:42.660]  But let's talk about the intelligence report.
[03:05:43.260 --> 03:05:50.749]  That has surfaced in the circumstantial evidence that they put in there saying that this is how we know it was a Russian.
[03:05:52.971 --> 03:05:57.096]  I've read that entire 25-page report multiple times.
[03:05:58.457 --> 03:06:00.640]  And half of it is laughable.
[03:06:01.701 --> 03:06:03.623]  It is absurd beyond belief.
[03:06:04.701 --> 03:06:27.373]  For example, they're expecting us to believe that the Russian intelligence services are foolish enough to leave the Russian language in the code, to leave the date and time stamp that the program was compiled, to use a Cyrillic keyboard which could be detected by forensic science,
[03:06:28.793 --> 03:06:35.395]  And lastly, to have an IP address that points back to the Russian Kremlin.
[03:06:35.455 --> 03:06:49.459]  Seriously, the way that this was done and the lack of sophistication suggests a 15-year-old boy or an 18-year-old somewhere who's bored in their bedroom at night going, let's see if I can hack into the DNC.
[03:06:49.959 --> 03:06:54.660]  You notice that as soon as we started pointing fingers at Russia,
[03:06:55.300 --> 03:07:01.205]  As trying to manipulate our elections, nobody's paying any attention to the actual emails anymore.
[03:07:01.365 --> 03:07:01.906]  That's right.
[03:07:01.966 --> 03:07:03.147]  Isn't that the real problem?
[03:07:03.367 --> 03:07:04.608]  Oh yeah.
[03:07:04.948 --> 03:07:07.290]  Isn't that what this is truly about?
[03:07:08.071 --> 03:07:18.259]  Misconduct that no one's paying any attention to now because we have a misdirection going, oh there's something far more important than this misconduct.
[03:07:18.720 --> 03:07:22.243]  And that is the fact that it was the Russians that told us about it.
[03:07:22.743 --> 03:07:23.123]  Please.
[03:07:23.783 --> 03:07:24.744]  Wake up America.
[03:07:25.024 --> 03:07:25.904]  Wake the F up.
[03:07:26.444 --> 03:07:28.964]  We are bamboozled by our government.
[03:07:29.605 --> 03:07:40.007]  They can put out these 25 page reports and suddenly every news agency except for the places like Alex Jones or RT where I was talking last night.
[03:07:41.067 --> 03:07:48.989]  Everybody's just repeating it as if it's true without thinking it through without understanding the basic precepts.
[03:07:49.790 --> 03:08:02.747]  Of cyber security without disrespecting our intelligence services we are They are either naive or they are purposely deceiving us one or the other
[03:08:20.699 --> 03:08:26.942]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:26.982 --> 03:08:31.144]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:52.759 --> 03:08:58.261]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Owen Schroer, Leigh-Anne McAdoo with you, and we have stacks of news.
[03:08:58.281 --> 03:09:01.602]  We were just trying to shuffle through all of it before we got on air here.
[03:09:02.242 --> 03:09:08.865]  And the big thing that I want to start with here, Leigh-Anne, is everything that's going on on Capitol Hill right now.
[03:09:08.965 --> 03:09:11.506]  It was a wild week on Capitol Hill.
[03:09:11.566 --> 03:09:12.866]  I mean, truly amazing.
[03:09:12.926 --> 03:09:20.169]  I don't know if there's ever been a more entertaining week on Capitol Hill, certainly in my lifetime, for someone that
[03:09:20.589 --> 03:09:22.190]  Tunes into C-SPAN regularly.
[03:09:22.250 --> 03:09:23.631]  C-SPAN is normally kind of boring.
[03:09:24.051 --> 03:09:24.751]  Not this week.
[03:09:24.951 --> 03:09:26.572]  Plenty of entertainment to go around.
[03:09:26.612 --> 03:09:34.757]  Now the big story, Leigh-Anne, yesterday the House votes on the blueprint of the budget that will allow government to gut Obamacare.
[03:09:34.817 --> 03:09:38.939]  Today they started debating and they had a vote in the Senate.
[03:09:39.399 --> 03:09:41.741]  It was very fiery, as you can imagine.
[03:09:42.121 --> 03:09:43.562]  The Democrats are all crying.
[03:09:43.982 --> 03:09:44.802]  And you know, here's the one thing.
[03:09:44.822 --> 03:09:46.103]  I've got some points I want to talk about.
[03:09:46.143 --> 03:09:47.244]  I want to hear from you on this too.
[03:09:49.985 --> 03:09:50.825]  We need a plan!
[03:09:50.865 --> 03:09:51.565]  We need a plan!
[03:09:51.585 --> 03:09:52.906]  It's like, okay, yeah, we need a plan.
[03:09:52.926 --> 03:09:55.347]  We're not going to come into this, obviously, with nothing.
[03:09:55.867 --> 03:10:00.449]  But they have this weird attitude where it's like they really think that health care is not going to exist.
[03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:01.409]  They need some new plan.
[03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:02.609]  And I'm sitting here scratching my head.
[03:10:02.629 --> 03:10:07.371]  I'm like, why don't we just go back to what it was before the Affordable Care Act?
[03:10:07.931 --> 03:10:11.713]  Is that like too simple that people can't even wrap their head around it?
[03:10:12.233 --> 03:10:18.757]  Right, and Donald Trump and others have made it known that they like some of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act.
[03:10:18.817 --> 03:10:23.220]  Obviously that they can't deny you coverage if you have pre-existing conditions.
[03:10:23.260 --> 03:10:27.042]  They're going to keep that regardless of what new plan they come up with.
[03:10:27.102 --> 03:10:28.924]  That is something everyone can agree on.
[03:10:29.464 --> 03:10:33.446]  But they're just going to open up to a little bit of competition so that we can actually get these prices down.
[03:10:33.506 --> 03:10:38.530]  And Donald Trump's plan that he put out there was opening it up so they can go across state lines.
[03:10:39.284 --> 03:10:39.644]  I don't know.
[03:10:57.734 --> 03:11:08.922]  I couldn't believe this, and I don't think I've ever seen anything like this, and people, pundits were writing about it, but the Democrats who were voting no on the proposed budget that would eventually gut the Affordable Care Act
[03:11:09.642 --> 03:11:15.546]  We're up there trying to debate or they were lecturing everybody that was in the hall at the time.
[03:11:15.566 --> 03:11:26.234]  And every time the presiding officer over the hearing had to slam his gavel and tell the person, hey, we're not debating here.
[03:11:26.695 --> 03:11:27.615]  This is a vote.
[03:11:28.056 --> 03:11:29.657]  You are wasting everyone's time.
[03:11:30.137 --> 03:11:31.578]  And I saw it again today.
[03:11:31.598 --> 03:11:36.462]  This was going on as the House was deliberating on this before the vote.
[03:11:37.162 --> 03:11:38.503]  It's just like Donald Trump with the media.
[03:11:39.444 --> 03:11:46.746]  These petulant children, as you've been phrasing it for a while, now are having to be scolded like petulant children.
[03:11:46.826 --> 03:11:48.086]  It's happening on the Hill.
[03:11:48.166 --> 03:11:49.406]  It's happening in the media.
[03:11:49.766 --> 03:11:50.647]  It's really amazing to see.
[03:11:50.667 --> 03:12:00.869]  It's about to be happening at the inauguration with, you know, celebrities and scientists and activists and all sorts of people that just cannot stand the fact that Donald Trump's going to be the president.
[03:12:01.698 --> 03:12:05.981]  And we're going to talk about that because we've got some news on that.
[03:12:06.061 --> 03:12:08.262]  Obviously, we're going to be at the inauguration.
[03:12:08.422 --> 03:12:10.283]  This is the place where you want to get the coverage, folks.
[03:12:10.303 --> 03:12:11.284]  We're going to be on the streets.
[03:12:11.924 --> 03:12:13.485]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:12:14.125 --> 03:12:16.166]  But you know, here was some irony that I found in this.
[03:12:16.187 --> 03:12:20.209]  So the Democrats, a lot of them oppose Mattis.
[03:12:20.549 --> 03:12:20.809]  I don't
[03:12:41.079 --> 03:12:51.605]  As what the Republicans are going to do with the Affordable Care Act to replace it, which again, actually Republicans time and time again, they bring this up and the Republicans on the floor say, here's the plan.
[03:12:51.645 --> 03:12:56.888]  They literally shake the binder with the plan and they still say, we need a plan, we need a plan.
[03:12:57.188 --> 03:13:03.254]  But the Democrats need to put out that fake news that they have no plan and they just want to take it away and stop your grandma from having health care.
[03:13:03.294 --> 03:13:05.096]  It's better to put that fake news out there.
[03:13:05.116 --> 03:13:07.338]  Look at this complete hypocrisy and irony.
[03:13:07.879 --> 03:13:09.840]  They offer no replacement for Mattis.
[03:13:10.521 --> 03:13:15.206]  So they're up here complaining about how Mattis cannot serve, but they offer no replacement.
[03:13:15.726 --> 03:13:17.629]  Oh, but we need a plan!
[03:13:17.649 --> 03:13:19.110]  I need a plan!
[03:13:19.170 --> 03:13:21.433]  Show me the plan to replace Obamacare!
[03:13:21.493 --> 03:13:22.354]  Show me the plan!
[03:13:22.414 --> 03:13:23.676]  Oh, actually, here's a plan.
[03:13:24.236 --> 03:13:26.739]  The woman's name was Diane Black.
[03:13:27.140 --> 03:13:28.081]  She's from Tennessee.
[03:13:28.742 --> 03:13:32.707]  And every time one of these Democrats would come up from the Senate today and say,
[03:13:34.448 --> 03:13:35.448]  I need to see a plan.
[03:13:35.468 --> 03:13:39.910]  I cannot just have all these people with health care just go in with no coverage.
[03:13:39.970 --> 03:13:41.930]  I need to see a plan before we can move forward.
[03:13:41.970 --> 03:13:45.552]  I can't believe Republicans would even suggest such a thing without a plan.
[03:13:45.892 --> 03:13:51.113]  And then Diane Black for like the fifth time in 30 minutes goes, here's the plan right here.
[03:13:51.133 --> 03:13:52.714]  We have biners, a lot of plans.
[03:13:52.774 --> 03:13:54.394]  People, Donald Trump has offered plans.
[03:13:54.414 --> 03:13:55.555]  We have state competition.
[03:13:55.775 --> 03:13:56.615]  Next thing that comes up,
[03:13:56.795 --> 03:13:58.536]  Well, I need to see a plan here.
[03:13:58.676 --> 03:14:00.197]  I cannot believe the Republicans.
[03:14:00.257 --> 03:14:00.837]  It's like, what is going on?
[03:14:00.877 --> 03:14:04.839]  It's like they got their talking points and it does not, they're total disregard for the truth.
[03:14:04.879 --> 03:14:08.361]  They've been given the talking points that the GOP has no plan.
[03:14:08.401 --> 03:14:16.504]  They have no plan because that's, that allows, you know, the people here, the American people to get the little chitter chatter on Facebook and, you know, fight with everyone.
[03:14:16.524 --> 03:14:17.445]  Well, they have no plan.
[03:14:17.465 --> 03:14:19.126]  I mean, it just, it's just.
[03:14:20.046 --> 03:14:21.748]  Which they buy completely, obviously.
[03:14:21.808 --> 03:14:24.791]  Just like, well, we don't need to go down the dossier.
[03:14:24.891 --> 03:14:25.912]  Just like they bought that.
[03:14:26.012 --> 03:14:26.593]  Exactly.
[03:14:26.713 --> 03:14:30.116]  Well, anything they can to just stymie Donald Trump becoming the president.
[03:14:30.216 --> 03:14:37.604]  And so they, the Democrats, have obviously gotten fairly hostile in their posture to just totally resist Donald Trump.
[03:14:38.304 --> 03:14:40.907]  But the Daily Caller points out how if anyone
[03:14:41.427 --> 03:14:58.320]  Should have been able to be stopped as far as Donald Trump's appointments It should have been Jeff Sessions, but he almost certainly is gonna become the Attorney General I mean they levied all sorts of racist charges against him at least allegations of rate racism So he actually had a failed confirmation once before
[03:14:59.710 --> 03:15:07.735]  So, you know, the fact that they weren't able to even stop Jeff Sessions, that kind of shows how impotent the Democrats are to stop Donald Trump.
[03:15:08.055 --> 03:15:09.236]  Well, and they just don't have the numbers.
[03:15:09.616 --> 03:15:14.259]  Just flat out, the math just does not work out for them right now when it comes to these votes.
[03:15:14.960 --> 03:15:20.083]  Certainly the tears outweigh on their side, but unfortunately that's not what measures the vote.
[03:15:20.623 --> 03:15:24.868]  Now that we were talking about the dossier, this was truly unbelievable, folks.
[03:15:24.948 --> 03:15:29.072]  I don't know if you saw the story in Salon, Leigh-Anne.
[03:15:29.232 --> 03:15:32.395]  Salon gets even worse and worse every day, and it's amazing.
[03:15:32.435 --> 03:15:35.579]  It's actually quite an accomplishment to be able to say that for Salon.
[03:15:35.979 --> 03:15:38.661]  What do we know about Donald Trump's outrageous dossier?
[03:15:39.041 --> 03:15:40.022]  Almost nothing.
[03:15:40.082 --> 03:15:41.063]  Well, almost nothing.
[03:15:41.143 --> 03:15:42.384]  Actually, we know a lot about it.
[03:15:42.404 --> 03:15:45.006]  It was fake, and we know who perpetrated the false narrative.
[03:15:45.246 --> 03:15:51.011]  But Salon clearly knows nothing, except that it exposes his most serious weakness.
[03:15:51.311 --> 03:15:53.472]  Trump got this far by smashing political norms.
[03:15:53.492 --> 03:15:54.353]  Yeah, thank God.
[03:15:54.373 --> 03:16:01.819]  Now he's left with no real friends, even though he has thousands, 20,000 people at every rally he goes to, and little political capital.
[03:16:02.279 --> 03:16:04.361]  He's the President of the United States.
[03:16:05.021 --> 03:16:08.266]  Salon lives in complete rejection of reality.
[03:16:08.326 --> 03:16:10.049]  They go on, they go on Leanne.
[03:16:10.269 --> 03:16:17.981]  For an ordinary politician who pretty much plays by the rules, an unsubstantiated story of such salaciousness generally would not even reach the public.
[03:16:18.461 --> 03:16:19.984]  They're blaming Trump!
[03:16:20.985 --> 03:16:22.126]  Can you believe this?
[03:16:22.987 --> 03:16:25.288]  They're actually blaming Donald Trump.
[03:16:25.989 --> 03:16:37.838]  Well, it's like we see how, you know, the stories that should have tanked Hillary Clinton decades ago, really, how they have never made it to the surface, her and Bill, because the media is there protecting them.
[03:16:37.878 --> 03:16:44.143]  So you can see how the media, when they're not protecting you, they're just going to go and take these salacious allegations that they even spell out.
[03:16:44.443 --> 03:16:45.644]  You really shouldn't believe this.
[03:16:45.664 --> 03:16:46.665]  This probably isn't true.
[03:16:46.685 --> 03:16:48.467]  But we're going to put it out there for you anyway.
[03:16:49.087 --> 03:16:52.849]  That's the difference when you have the media hacks on your side versus not.
[03:16:53.069 --> 03:16:57.232]  And then it finishes the little story here talking about credibility mattering.
[03:16:57.932 --> 03:17:04.216]  Salon, who stands up for pedophiles and blames Donald Trump for a despicable dossier against Donald Trump.
[03:17:04.396 --> 03:17:06.898]  And I love also, too, now the new narrative.
[03:17:06.958 --> 03:17:12.341]  Now the new thing they're putting out is this ex-British intelligence officer who was gathering all this intel.
[03:17:12.601 --> 03:17:14.482]  He's James Bond.
[03:17:14.722 --> 03:17:16.023]  He's James Bond.
[03:17:16.063 --> 03:17:17.604]  How dare you question intel?
[03:17:17.684 --> 03:17:18.425]  He's lame, Bond.
[03:17:19.425 --> 03:17:20.586]  It's just a total failure.
[03:17:21.527 --> 03:17:23.068]  It's just so frustrating.
[03:17:23.088 --> 03:17:23.649]  Now here's the thing.
[03:17:25.450 --> 03:17:33.136]  I don't know what it was some sort of a moderator or administrator for 4chan actually talked to Michael Savage yesterday and they're claiming complete responsibility.
[03:17:33.176 --> 03:17:36.959]  They're like, we planted this, we wanted to see how far it could go.
[03:17:37.199 --> 03:17:45.326]  Now that's what I said yesterday when we were talking on the nightly news and I'm not sure if that's completely substantiated yet or true but it certainly had something to do with it.
[03:17:45.506 --> 03:17:58.267]  Well it's funny because then you have like Anonymous tweeting out you know that I mean they're all for this dossier they say it's true they say the Russians absolutely have something against Trump and so there's like kind of this coup going on with the hackers so.
[03:17:59.289 --> 03:18:08.435]  I want to get into this story on the other side about the Chinese state media and Rex Tillerson yesterday, but to finish out this segment, Leanne, let's talk about this story.
[03:18:08.856 --> 03:18:15.800]  Scientists race to develop vaccine for the plague amid fears terrorists could use the medieval disease to kill millions.
[03:18:16.201 --> 03:18:21.824]  Now I'm sitting here, I'm scratching my head, and in this story, it's out of the sun, and of course, you know,
[03:18:22.850 --> 03:18:27.111]  You kind of face this when you're in the media, when you think about what to report or what to say.
[03:18:27.732 --> 03:18:36.234]  For example, them talking about basically how terrorists could use this bacteria to kill millions of people, and I'm sitting here like, well boy, I hope a terrorist doesn't read this.
[03:18:36.455 --> 03:18:36.535]  Yeah.
[03:18:36.555 --> 03:18:37.395]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:18:38.235 --> 03:18:40.616]  Who knows if they have the capability or the capacity, but...
[03:18:41.056 --> 03:18:50.820]  A couple years ago, they actually sort of spelled out exactly how a terrorist would be able to take the plague and develop it into... It's like they're begging for it.
[03:18:51.040 --> 03:18:56.082]  Wow, you actually just spelled it out and let them know the exact means by which to carry this out.
[03:18:56.122 --> 03:19:00.463]  Yeah, it's almost like, oh, I hope a terrorist doesn't get their hands on that.
[03:19:00.484 --> 03:19:02.464]  Yeah, like Hillary Clinton's open email server.
[03:19:02.744 --> 03:19:09.067]  Oh, I hope nobody hacks the open server I have over here that donated millions to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:19:09.827 --> 03:19:21.773]  Yeah, well, and that kind of tied in for me, for some reason I was thinking about the, um, you were talking about those, um, the little drones that the military... Oh, the miniature, the macro, micro drones?
[03:19:21.993 --> 03:19:22.613]  Yeah.
[03:19:22.633 --> 03:19:23.934]  So talk about a way to... Swarm of them.
[03:19:24.494 --> 03:19:25.815]  The drone swarm.
[03:19:26.075 --> 03:19:27.196]  Like a locust.
[03:19:27.436 --> 03:19:37.681]  Yeah, it's like a locust swarm of these drones which are constantly being warned that these could be reverse engineered, that terrorists could get their hands on them, and then think about, ugh, just attached to a weaponized plague.
[03:19:38.121 --> 03:19:38.341]  Mm-hmm.
[03:19:38.902 --> 03:19:40.163]  Well, actually, it's amazing.
[03:19:40.203 --> 03:19:41.664]  I mean, I lived in St.
[03:19:41.704 --> 03:19:41.864]  Louis.
[03:19:41.884 --> 03:19:47.729]  I don't know if this happens in Texas, but the locusts come out every seven years or whatever, and there's swarms of them in the air.
[03:19:47.789 --> 03:19:49.550]  That's what these drones look like that you're talking about.
[03:19:49.971 --> 03:19:55.375]  But I don't know if, you know, terrorists have the capacity to create a bacteria weapon.
[03:19:55.795 --> 03:20:03.341]  I do know that companies have the capacity to mass-produce and mass-sell vaccines, and they love doing that.
[03:20:03.421 --> 03:20:04.482]  More of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:04.562 --> 03:20:06.264]  Owen Shroyer, Leanne McAdoo on the other side.
[03:20:14.514 --> 03:20:24.059]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[03:20:25.100 --> 03:20:33.385]  And so I get questions all the time over the years, why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsStore.com or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[03:20:34.125 --> 03:20:34.765]  And it's simple.
[03:20:35.366 --> 03:20:40.468]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[03:20:40.909 --> 03:20:41.909]  And there's a nexus point.
[03:20:41.929 --> 03:20:44.791]  There's quality versus price.
[03:20:44.831 --> 03:20:46.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[03:20:47.332 --> 03:21:00.319]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor, has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[03:21:01.696 --> 03:21:03.757]  The true next generation in body armor.
[03:21:04.658 --> 03:21:11.622]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[03:21:12.422 --> 03:21:15.224]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[03:21:15.244 --> 03:21:17.665]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[03:21:17.685 --> 03:21:21.688]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[03:21:22.128 --> 03:21:22.929]  Well, believe me,
[03:21:24.029 --> 03:21:26.710]  This is disruptive to tyrants worldwide.
[03:21:27.290 --> 03:21:37.714]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[03:21:38.354 --> 03:21:39.975]  It's nanotube technology.
[03:21:40.575 --> 03:21:42.096]  It's created here in Texas.
[03:21:42.736 --> 03:21:49.838]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[03:21:50.539 --> 03:21:50.779]  We've
[03:21:51.859 --> 03:21:52.899]  Went out and did some testing.
[03:21:53.339 --> 03:21:55.680]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[03:21:55.700 --> 03:22:02.161]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible could be so strong.
[03:22:02.381 --> 03:22:15.703]  So what we did is we went out, we used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[03:22:16.063 --> 03:22:16.863]  Born in Texas.
[03:22:17.223 --> 03:22:18.144]  Made in America.
[03:22:18.384 --> 03:22:20.984]  Exclusively available at M4WarStore.com right now.
[03:22:21.104 --> 03:22:21.885]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[03:22:21.945 --> 03:22:22.865]  It's a quarter-inch thick.
[03:22:23.246 --> 03:22:24.567]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[03:22:24.607 --> 03:22:25.247]  It's waterproof.
[03:22:25.267 --> 03:22:25.728]  You can wear it.
[03:22:25.768 --> 03:22:26.328]  It's comfortable.
[03:22:26.408 --> 03:22:27.189]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[03:22:27.229 --> 03:22:29.551]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[03:22:30.011 --> 03:22:37.637]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[03:22:38.318 --> 03:22:41.480]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[03:22:42.001 --> 03:22:48.606]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[03:22:48.626 --> 03:22:49.667]  I mean, what did they really say about it?
[03:22:49.827 --> 03:22:51.188]  No, this is through the roof.
[03:22:51.369 --> 03:22:54.171]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[03:22:54.832 --> 03:23:02.960]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[03:23:03.440 --> 03:23:08.325]  So they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[03:23:09.326 --> 03:23:10.106]  I mean, you can look up the numbers.
[03:23:10.126 --> 03:23:15.950]  90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in official crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[03:23:15.970 --> 03:23:17.231]  This stops that unless it's a slug.
[03:23:17.651 --> 03:23:18.792]  I mean, that's amazing.
[03:23:18.852 --> 03:23:22.074]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[03:23:22.314 --> 03:23:23.594]  And soon, they won't have it.
[03:23:23.935 --> 03:23:28.337]  If it's available to civilians who are not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[03:23:28.497 --> 03:23:32.500]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[03:23:33.360 --> 03:23:36.705]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[03:23:36.725 --> 03:23:37.466]  People didn't believe it.
[03:23:37.807 --> 03:23:38.828]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[03:23:38.888 --> 03:23:40.610]  I feed my horse hay.
[03:23:41.932 --> 03:23:44.035]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[03:23:47.330 --> 03:23:49.132]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[03:23:50.393 --> 03:23:52.296]  Again, fund the InfoWard.
[03:23:52.436 --> 03:23:56.340]  Get the game-changing nanotech tubes from Buck Rogers.
[03:23:56.840 --> 03:23:58.883]  It's a win-win.
[03:23:59.203 --> 03:23:58.883]  $200.
[03:23:59.443 --> 03:24:02.406]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWardStore.com.
[03:24:02.507 --> 03:24:03.207]  It's amazing.
[03:24:22.535 --> 03:24:23.855]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:24.336 --> 03:24:26.936]  Fourth hour, Owen Schroer, Leanne McAdoo with you.
[03:24:27.756 --> 03:24:29.857]  And it has been a crazy week on the Hill.
[03:24:29.897 --> 03:24:31.217]  The inauguration is next week.
[03:24:31.698 --> 03:24:32.738]  We will have all the coverage.
[03:24:32.778 --> 03:24:39.860]  We'll be on the streets and bringing you all the up-to-date footage, protests, news, whatever's going on.
[03:24:40.360 --> 03:24:44.721]  And we're actually going to get a lot more into that into the next segment.
[03:24:45.281 --> 03:24:47.342]  We've got some developments with the Trump protests.
[03:24:48.042 --> 03:24:59.326]  Some more disgustingness coming out of the anti-Trump people, and also a very interesting and important move out of the DC National Guard that we're going to cover as well in the next segment.
[03:24:59.386 --> 03:25:01.967]  But this segment, I want to talk about this.
[03:25:03.007 --> 03:25:08.309]  Chinese state media tells Donald Trump's team to prepare for military clash.
[03:25:09.010 --> 03:25:12.571]  Now this story is coming out of a Chinese tabloid, so how much
[03:25:13.351 --> 03:25:16.913]  You know, gravitas you want to take out of this is up to you.
[03:25:17.234 --> 03:25:18.735]  But there is actually something behind this.
[03:25:18.755 --> 03:25:19.495]  I'm going to explain this.
[03:25:20.135 --> 03:25:20.856]  It says the U.S.
[03:25:20.876 --> 03:25:26.540]  should prepare for a military clash, a state-run Chinese tabloid newspaper has warned.
[03:25:26.960 --> 03:25:28.441]  Less than 24 hours after U.S.
[03:25:28.841 --> 03:25:37.327]  Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson appeared to call for a blockade of the South China Sea islands is when this story was put out.
[03:25:37.367 --> 03:25:38.928]  Now, this is the key here, Leigh-Anne.
[03:25:39.668 --> 03:26:00.175]  So, Rex Tillerson, in his hearing yesterday, obviously had to go and answer a lot of questions, and I'm not sure the exact nature of the question that was brought up that led to him talking about the situation in the South China Seas, but basically he brought up the situation, how there's turmoil and tension in the South China Seas, there's territorial battles going on.
[03:26:00.875 --> 03:26:07.940]  He talks about how the Chinese are essentially building their own islands out there, laming stake to those, you know, militarizing those islands.
[03:26:08.300 --> 03:26:17.727]  It's kind of an unprecedented move, honestly, but also it's a move that is making the other countries in the region not too happy about it.
[03:26:17.787 --> 03:26:23.791]  But there's something that they didn't talk about that's very important here that Rex Tillerson knows damn well, okay?
[03:26:23.931 --> 03:26:24.432]  Trust me.
[03:26:24.992 --> 03:26:29.874]  Now, the territory battle in the South China Sea goes beyond just territory.
[03:26:30.294 --> 03:26:36.055]  There is actually a ton of oil in this region and a lot of oil exploration going on.
[03:26:36.576 --> 03:26:43.038]  So this territory battle also has a lot to do with claims to the energy that's coming out of the South China Sea.
[03:26:43.138 --> 03:26:43.798]  And again,
[03:26:44.318 --> 03:26:45.959]  Rex Tillerson knows this, folks.
[03:26:46.179 --> 03:26:46.699]  Trust me.
[03:26:47.219 --> 03:26:47.859]  He knows this.
[03:26:48.299 --> 03:26:55.061]  So this is something, to me, Leigh-Anne, that is going to be kind of ongoing developing.
[03:26:55.181 --> 03:26:56.681]  Tillerson obviously knows this.
[03:26:57.102 --> 03:26:59.922]  They didn't really touch on it in the hearing yesterday.
[03:27:00.422 --> 03:27:01.363]  But what do you think?
[03:27:01.403 --> 03:27:07.444]  I mean, is China... And they actually mention this in the story, how if the U.S.
[03:27:07.985 --> 03:27:12.246]  wants to stop what China is doing in the South China Sea, they essentially have to
[03:27:13.366 --> 03:27:15.648]  Send physical troops there, send ships there.
[03:27:15.688 --> 03:27:19.911]  I mean, it would have to be a physical hot war if they actually wanted to stop this.
[03:27:19.931 --> 03:27:21.472]  I mean, is this what we're looking at here?
[03:27:21.492 --> 03:27:22.813]  I mean, we've been looking at the Russians.
[03:27:22.833 --> 03:27:23.313]  Right.
[03:27:23.453 --> 03:27:26.395]  Maybe we're ignoring a bigger fish here with the China, the Chinese.
[03:27:26.415 --> 03:27:27.636]  Of course, Alex has been saying that.
[03:27:27.696 --> 03:27:32.739]  Well, the Chinese military has already been making some really aggressive posturing this week as well.
[03:27:33.160 --> 03:27:36.822]  This is even before Rex Tillerson made that statement.
[03:27:37.202 --> 03:27:39.064]  So, yeah, they're definitely trying to
[03:27:39.704 --> 03:27:40.125]  I don't know.
[03:27:59.824 --> 03:28:01.425]  Well, what the U.S.
[03:28:01.485 --> 03:28:04.067]  can do, or what the U.S.
[03:28:04.307 --> 03:28:19.476]  has done in the past, is use the military-industrial complex proxy wars to kind of politicize those regions so that they can bring in their oil executives to come take that energy and then filter that profit to whoever plays the game.
[03:28:19.496 --> 03:28:22.838]  Well, you guys are fighting over this, so we're going to take it away from you.
[03:28:22.938 --> 03:28:23.659]  Right, right.
[03:28:23.719 --> 03:28:25.480]  We'll divvy it up fairly, believe me.
[03:28:25.900 --> 03:28:28.843]  So it should be interesting to see what goes on with that.
[03:28:28.883 --> 03:28:34.107]  But that's kind of the untold story within the story, is all the oil and the energy to be had there.
[03:28:34.147 --> 03:28:37.530]  And I'm just going to say this- Yeah, we're supposed to have all eyes on Russia, but really, what about China?
[03:28:37.570 --> 03:28:40.792]  And I'm just going to say this about Rex Tillerson, and I'm not going to go too deep into this.
[03:28:41.413 --> 03:28:43.074]  You can take what you want from this.
[03:28:43.234 --> 03:28:51.301]  But I think at this point, Rex Tillerson to me is either a globalist implant and perhaps a danger to the Trump administration.
[03:28:52.217 --> 03:28:57.220]  Or an absolute neutron bomb against the New World Order.
[03:28:57.400 --> 03:28:59.201]  I think that he's one of those two right now.
[03:28:59.241 --> 03:29:13.089]  And I'm going to be keeping my eyes close to Rex Tillerson, because I actually think if he is, if he's the neutron bomb against the establishment, against the New World Order, that he could potentially be, I think his life might be in danger just as much as Donald Trump's, Leanne, to be honest with you.
[03:29:13.149 --> 03:29:14.750]  Well, I was reading an article on Breitbart.
[03:29:14.770 --> 03:29:19.133]  They did some pretty fair coverage, just kind of making fun of the fact that all of the news
[03:29:19.793 --> 03:29:34.039]  Was focused on this fake dossier that they really didn't tear apart Rex Tillerson and a lot of the things that he was saying because he didn't prove the skeptics wrong by proving that he was going to, you know, be a good man and choose the moral high ground over things.
[03:29:34.079 --> 03:29:39.601]  He put himself out there as his international relations experience is business and that's what it's going to be about for him.
[03:29:39.841 --> 03:29:46.045]  Well, and it was amazing, too, because him, Tillerson, and Pompeo went along with a lot of the establishment talking points that had a lot of people worried.
[03:29:46.325 --> 03:29:49.967]  So I'm wondering if they're playing possum, or if Trump really means it when he says, think of yourself.
[03:29:50.307 --> 03:29:50.648]  I don't know.
[03:29:50.708 --> 03:29:53.629]  More news on the other side, specifically regarding the inauguration.
[03:29:53.689 --> 03:29:56.211]  Owen Troyer, Leanne McAdoo, Alex Jones Show, fourth hour.
[03:29:59.413 --> 03:30:00.313]  We're on the march.
[03:30:00.814 --> 03:30:02.435]  The empire's on the run.
[03:30:03.355 --> 03:30:06.057]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:10.146 --> 03:30:21.529]  Yesterday, the Senate took the first step towards repealing the Affordable Care Act with a 51-48 vote on a new budget blueprint that would open the doors to gut and rid ourselves of the disaster that is Obamacare without allowing Democrats to filibuster.
[03:30:21.709 --> 03:30:34.513]  Liberal tears flowed heavy as the Senate had to be called in order every time a Democrat voted no, with a nice lecture to go with it, forcing the providing officer, Senator Cory Gardner, to slam his gavel and scold the Democrats, repeating ad nauseam, debate is not allowed during a vote.
[03:30:34.653 --> 03:30:37.615]  Now today, the vote moves on to the House, where we have had similar results.
[03:30:37.715 --> 03:30:47.740]  The debate has been heated, with Democrats speaking past their time, bringing in large, blown-up photos of children to win sympathy points, and trying to argue that Republicans are ending healthcare, like before the Affordable Care Act, right?
[03:30:47.860 --> 03:31:00.107]  Senator Hakeem Jeffries claims that voting against the Affordable Care Act sets up Americans to be screwed by bigwigs and fat cats in the healthcare industry, ignoring the fact that this is what the Affordable Care Act did, creating healthcare monopolies in some regions.
[03:31:00.267 --> 03:31:06.052]  He also said that Republicans had no plan, to which Republicans responded by showing the many plans they brought to the debate floor.
[03:31:06.132 --> 03:31:09.414]  This is Owen Troyer, and I've got jugs of liberal tears here.
[03:31:10.195 --> 03:31:16.340]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[03:31:16.900 --> 03:31:18.301]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[03:31:19.195 --> 03:31:21.117]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[03:31:21.697 --> 03:31:27.262]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.

[03:33:35.066 --> 03:33:36.666]  Owen Troyer, Leanne McAdoo with you.
[03:33:36.706 --> 03:33:40.948]  We've got two segments left here in the fourth hour and I've got a special right now.
[03:33:41.388 --> 03:33:48.350]  DNA Force is 10% off right now at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:51.851]  DNA Force is one of our flagship products.

[03:33:54.712 --> 03:33:59.654]  And this is one that I was talking about the last time I believe I was on the Alex Jones Show here.
[03:34:00.034 --> 03:34:08.539]  You're going to start seeing these ads on television talking about telomeres and how this can extend your life, extending your telomeres.
[03:34:08.559 --> 03:34:13.382]  Well, this is something that InfoWars Life has been doing for a long time.
[03:34:13.462 --> 03:34:15.203]  Dr. Group formulated DNA Force.
[03:34:15.963 --> 03:34:17.404]  I believe it's over a year old now.
[03:34:17.444 --> 03:34:18.745]  I've been taking it for a long time.
[03:34:18.805 --> 03:34:20.566]  I take one in the morning, I take one at night.
[03:34:20.886 --> 03:34:24.648]  It's one of my favorite InfoWars Life products, but it's 10% off right now.
[03:34:25.088 --> 03:34:29.531]  But this is a groundbreaking, super advanced product, DNA Force, right?
[03:34:29.571 --> 03:34:37.334]  Now folks, and I'm telling you, they're going to start talking about this in the mainstream now, how telomeres are the secret to living a longer life.
[03:34:37.974 --> 03:34:39.515]  And well, we already had this.
[03:34:39.715 --> 03:34:41.236]  We knew this for a long time.

[03:35:12.611 --> 03:35:12.771]  No.
[03:35:12.891 --> 03:35:13.772]  That's something if you want.
[03:35:13.792 --> 03:35:14.552]  Fully juiced.
[03:35:14.772 --> 03:35:15.052]  Yeah.
[03:35:15.432 --> 03:35:16.133]  High energy.
[03:35:16.273 --> 03:35:20.015]  Even your high brand expensive ones out there don't even have high quality.
[03:35:20.075 --> 03:35:20.635]  It is amazing.
[03:35:20.655 --> 03:35:24.257]  I mean Alex and actually I think David was talking about this today too.
[03:35:24.777 --> 03:35:31.420]  The days when I don't take all of my InfoWars Live products, all the supplements I take, the mornings I don't take that, I can feel it.
[03:35:32.001 --> 03:35:33.041]  I can feel it by noon.
[03:35:33.221 --> 03:35:35.723]  And then the days where I do, I feel great all day long.
[03:35:36.183 --> 03:35:39.605]  But I'll tell you what, who doesn't feel great night right now?
[03:35:39.685 --> 03:35:40.345]  That's Madonna.
[03:35:40.365 --> 03:35:41.946]  You know, she's
[03:35:43.117 --> 03:35:46.218]  You know, baby's blood is doing her all right.
[03:35:46.878 --> 03:35:50.358]  Look, Madonna said that Trump winning was like a bad breakup.
[03:35:50.798 --> 03:35:54.339]  It's been really tough for Madonna, folks, but she's not done.
[03:35:54.839 --> 03:35:58.680]  You know, her meltdown continues to spiral out of control.
[03:35:58.700 --> 03:36:07.062]  And it's, you know, you thought that she reached a new low and she offered a little fellatio in order for you to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[03:36:07.102 --> 03:36:08.642]  No, no, it's gone lower.
[03:36:08.662 --> 03:36:09.482]  Get out the vote on that.
[03:36:09.682 --> 03:36:10.262]  It's gone lower.
[03:36:10.322 --> 03:36:11.123]  No, it didn't work.
[03:36:11.303 --> 03:36:15.245]  Most people, unfortunately, did not want fellatio from Madonna.
[03:36:15.526 --> 03:36:28.954]  But now, on Instagram, she has shared a public hair, excuse me, public, I can't even, I don't even want to say this, a pubic hair, a pubic hair photo with the Nike logo saying, just do it.
[03:36:29.634 --> 03:36:34.858]  And of course, she is referring to protesting Donald Trump's inauguration.
[03:36:35.758 --> 03:36:39.579]  And this is part of the Women's March on Washington.
[03:36:39.599 --> 03:36:42.120]  They're expecting over 200,000 people at this march.
[03:36:42.760 --> 03:36:46.362]  And Madonna says, with her pubic hair, just do it!
[03:36:46.562 --> 03:36:47.042]  Show up!
[03:36:47.362 --> 03:36:48.102]  You gotta protest.
[03:36:48.542 --> 03:36:52.324]  Hey, I'm not gonna tell everyone what you told me in the room earlier.
[03:36:53.304 --> 03:36:54.565]  Why do you gotta say that?
[03:36:56.985 --> 03:36:59.746]  I'll let everyone know how you really feel about Madonna.
[03:36:59.766 --> 03:37:01.807]  Look, Madonna, here's the thing.
[03:37:02.747 --> 03:37:02.967]  Look.
[03:37:03.248 --> 03:37:04.408]  What's your favorite Madonna song?
[03:37:04.736 --> 03:37:06.598]  I can't say a favorite Madonna song.
[03:37:06.778 --> 03:37:08.380]  I can only tell you a favorite Madonna album.
[03:37:08.420 --> 03:37:09.341]  But I will tell you this.
[03:37:09.361 --> 03:37:11.002]  I will tell you this.
[03:37:11.523 --> 03:37:16.648]  I'm glad that when I went and I went to her concert, I'm glad I ended up not touching her.
[03:37:16.728 --> 03:37:17.328]  I was close.
[03:37:17.348 --> 03:37:22.613]  I almost touched her hand after reading this story and hearing her offer fellatio for a vote.
[03:37:22.694 --> 03:37:25.897]  I'm glad I did not touch Madonna at that concert.
[03:37:25.957 --> 03:37:26.898]  But it's just incredible.
[03:37:29.281 --> 03:37:33.243]  Who in their right mind, these people aren't in their right mind is the correct answer here.
[03:37:33.823 --> 03:37:38.465]  So I guess it's a trick question, but who in their right mind puts out a pubic hair shot?
[03:37:38.765 --> 03:37:47.689]  This is like J-Lo literally bending over, putting a microphone up to her butt, and then sitting here complaining about how Donald Trump objectifies women.
[03:37:48.226 --> 03:37:48.446]  Right.
[03:37:48.827 --> 03:37:49.067]  What?
[03:37:49.347 --> 03:37:53.831]  Yes, that's... You just put out a picture of your private part.
[03:37:53.871 --> 03:37:54.512]  Your hoo-ha.
[03:37:54.792 --> 03:37:58.055]  It looks like it has one of those fake mustaches cut out on it.
[03:37:58.616 --> 03:38:03.060]  I'm not going to talk about the actual... The actual picture itself.
[03:38:03.080 --> 03:38:05.502]  You can go to Infowars.com and check out the article.
[03:38:06.022 --> 03:38:10.967]  But this is just one of the women that's supposed to show up to this...
[03:38:12.168 --> 03:38:13.088]  Katie Perry will be there.
[03:38:13.348 --> 03:38:14.849]  Katie Perry, Lena Dunham.
[03:38:14.869 --> 03:38:14.909]  Oh!
[03:38:15.329 --> 03:38:16.150]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:38:16.310 --> 03:38:16.910]  We said women.
[03:38:17.650 --> 03:38:18.090]  This is true.
[03:38:18.431 --> 03:38:22.892]  Meanwhile, we do have another actress, Nicole Kidman, kind of speaking out saying, hey, you know what?
[03:38:22.952 --> 03:38:24.853]  It's time for America to get behind the president.
[03:38:24.993 --> 03:38:25.913]  But you know what, though?
[03:38:25.974 --> 03:38:26.574]  Get over it.
[03:38:26.754 --> 03:38:27.094]  I'm sorry.
[03:38:27.114 --> 03:38:29.595]  I got to cut you off here because I want to get more to the bottom of this, Leigh-Anne.
[03:38:29.795 --> 03:38:30.616]  He's still on the story.
[03:38:30.696 --> 03:38:32.076]  Well, no, no, beyond Madonna, though.
[03:38:32.137 --> 03:38:34.978]  Okay, so you've got all these women, they want to march on Washington, alright?
[03:38:35.479 --> 03:38:37.260]  And this is what, this is what they're saying.
[03:38:37.760 --> 03:38:43.744]  They are saying they want to send a bold message to our new administration on the first day in office that women's rights are human rights.
[03:38:45.307 --> 03:38:46.928]  Is anybody disagreeing with that?
[03:38:47.088 --> 03:38:50.911]  Is there some sort of a uprising against women's rights that I'm missing?
[03:38:51.312 --> 03:38:51.832]  You're a woman.
[03:38:52.052 --> 03:38:53.153]  Am I missing something?
[03:38:53.353 --> 03:39:02.741]  Well, that goes back to the fake news, where they have to put up that narrative that the Republicans don't have a plan to replace Obamacare, even though they have at least six different versions of six different plans.
[03:39:03.221 --> 03:39:06.744]  But they also have to put that out there that Donald Trump is going to
[03:39:07.364 --> 03:39:07.444]  Good!
[03:39:07.464 --> 03:39:08.344]  Exclamation point!
[03:39:26.710 --> 03:39:27.211]  Exactly.
[03:39:27.271 --> 03:39:34.818]  And then if Planned Parenthood is so, you know, hard up for cash, why are they paying the leader like more than a million dollars a year?
[03:39:34.838 --> 03:39:40.003]  I forget her name, but they're always having these big parties with their celebrities and their celebrity endorsements.
[03:39:40.124 --> 03:39:40.684]  Here's an idea.
[03:39:40.704 --> 03:39:42.766]  How about George Soros can fund Planned Parenthood?
[03:39:42.786 --> 03:39:43.267]  How about that?
[03:39:43.327 --> 03:39:43.807]  Exactly.
[03:39:43.827 --> 03:39:45.089]  You don't need to take my money.
[03:39:45.529 --> 03:39:48.732]  Exactly, or Bill Gates, who, you know, thinks there's too many people in the world.
[03:39:48.772 --> 03:39:52.275]  He wants to vaccinate everyone five times before the first month of their life.
[03:39:52.395 --> 03:39:55.517]  So, I mean, you know, how about he funds Planned Parenthood if it's so great?
[03:39:55.998 --> 03:39:58.420]  I mean, you care about these people, Soros and Gates.
[03:39:58.500 --> 03:39:59.641]  Fund Planned Parenthood then.
[03:39:59.941 --> 03:40:00.922]  Quit taking our money.
[03:40:01.242 --> 03:40:02.784]  That's illegal and unconstitutional to me.
[03:40:03.284 --> 03:40:10.470]  America Ferreira, she's some actress, she says, since the election, so many fear that their voices will go unheard.
[03:40:10.810 --> 03:40:12.011]  No, we're hearing you cry.
[03:40:12.151 --> 03:40:12.852]  We're just laughing.
[03:40:12.892 --> 03:40:20.038]  Well that's what's funny is that since the election the Hollywood voices are going unheard because people are just sick and tired of being lectured by these Hollywood elites.
[03:40:20.679 --> 03:40:34.371]  Now I know that we have another Alex Jones report that he's filed on China communism and the South China Sea and we were just discussing that and I would love to get his breakdown on that situation there if you want to.
[03:40:36.232 --> 03:40:39.916]  All right well let's go ahead and hear what Alex has to say about the situation in the South China Sea.
[03:40:41.331 --> 03:40:44.172]  Communist China is the existential threat.
[03:40:44.232 --> 03:40:51.874]  Communist China was set up in power in 1949 by the Western powers, by the CIA, by the robber barons.
[03:40:52.814 --> 03:41:06.197]  China came out just yesterday, their official government newspaper, the People's Daily, and said, we are the champions of globalism and global government, we will prop up this worldwide system.
[03:41:07.097 --> 03:41:08.758]  Well, absolutely, they've been given
[03:41:09.798 --> 03:41:11.399]  Both ends of the Panama Canal.
[03:41:11.439 --> 03:41:13.239]  They've been given all the major deep water ports.
[03:41:13.599 --> 03:41:23.941]  They've been given a global monopoly on rare earth minerals because they've made deals with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and the big central banks to leverage out economic control of the planet.
[03:41:24.422 --> 03:41:37.445]  Now there was a public deal going back to the seventies, back when George Herbert Walker Bush was the main ambassador to China when Nixon set up this deal, that they would be set up as an economic superpower by the 21st century being dominant.
[03:41:37.685 --> 03:41:38.745]  It'd be the Chinese century.
[03:41:39.185 --> 03:41:45.296]  There's been literally thousands of articles, CFR reports on this, but the public isn't really aware of these deals that were made.
[03:41:45.316 --> 03:41:47.340]  They weren't official treaties, but they were deals.
[03:41:48.783 --> 03:41:49.424]  And in the deal...
[03:41:50.586 --> 03:41:57.351]  It was established that they wouldn't ever expand out of their own country, and that they wouldn't dominate the South China Sea, and that they wouldn't dominate Japan.
[03:41:57.992 --> 03:42:02.515]  And that they wouldn't be a major military power, but they could have nuclear weapons to, quote, defend themselves from Russia.
[03:42:02.976 --> 03:42:06.798]  Because, believe it or not, the Chinese have a real issue with the Russians more than us.
[03:42:06.919 --> 03:42:08.940]  We kicked the Japanese out in World War II.
[03:42:09.380 --> 03:42:11.482]  Again, our government put Mao Zedong in power.
[03:42:11.922 --> 03:42:13.403]  That was declassified a decade ago.
[03:42:14.384 --> 03:42:15.505]  Actually, more than a decade ago.
[03:42:15.545 --> 03:42:16.146]  I guess 2004.
[03:42:16.186 --> 03:42:18.028]  So 12 years ago.
[03:42:18.128 --> 03:42:27.876]  And the John Birch Society has been breaking that down since they were founded in the 1950s, expressly on the fact that our government had sold out to the Communist Chinese.
[03:42:27.896 --> 03:42:28.937]  But that's a whole other subject.
[03:42:29.318 --> 03:42:30.699]  Just giving credit where credit's due.
[03:42:30.739 --> 03:42:32.260]  Talk about being ahead of their time.
[03:42:33.481 --> 03:42:46.631]  And so the People's Daily last year said, we'll basically have war with you, we'll crush you, we're prepared for nuclear war, we're prepared for wars in the South China Sea or in the Pacific period, we'll take back any islands we want, we'll invade the Philippines.
[03:42:47.072 --> 03:42:48.673]  They've been extremely belligerent.
[03:42:49.213 --> 03:42:54.536]  They've also come out and said, we're going to defend globalism as it falls apart in Europe and the United States.
[03:42:54.576 --> 03:42:55.637]  We're going to empower it.
[03:42:56.037 --> 03:42:58.398]  And the Davos group's been bragging about that, you name it.
[03:42:58.739 --> 03:43:05.142]  It's the globalists, multinationals, with China, and with the Islamicists, against the rest of the world.
[03:43:07.004 --> 03:43:09.145]  The globalists double-crossed Russia as well.
[03:43:09.185 --> 03:43:14.168]  They had a deal, going back to the early 1990s, to not take over former
[03:43:15.251 --> 03:43:15.351]  Yes.
[03:43:34.139 --> 03:43:42.981]  Massively in the last year, and really the last eight, but in the last year it has gone to the edge of war.
[03:43:43.581 --> 03:43:56.024]  So there's major jockeying, major political changes happening around the world, major realignments, but the United States under a Trump presidency is going to be realigned with the UK, countries that break away from the euro,
[03:43:57.148 --> 03:44:02.749]  With any other nations that want to work with us, with Japan and others.
[03:44:03.429 --> 03:44:12.171]  And it's China, the global bankers, people like Soros, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the same old combine, and the Islamicists.
[03:44:12.651 --> 03:44:22.193]  It's those three groups, that's the axis of evil, against the American Republic and our own global system of free trade and free markets and open governments.
[03:44:22.853 --> 03:44:34.146]  Which was the original globalism that was being pushed by Eisenhower and others, that then got hijacked, and instead of actually putting in good governments in the Middle East and places like that, they were actually democratized and secular.
[03:44:34.726 --> 03:44:36.408]  By the 80s they reversed the program.
[03:44:36.428 --> 03:44:38.230]  Reagan really wasn't involved, but it happened.
[03:44:39.211 --> 03:44:50.160]  They reversed the program where they basically began to double-cross those nations and started putting actual tyrants in every time they could.
[03:44:50.180 --> 03:44:58.426]  So again, going back to Owen, the Communist Chinese are openly, constantly threatening to attack the United States.
[03:44:58.526 --> 03:45:01.609]  They are constantly threatening and talking about how they can destroy us.
[03:45:01.969 --> 03:45:03.090]  They're using North Korea
[03:45:03.830 --> 03:45:05.931]  Uh, as a go-between group as well.
[03:45:06.311 --> 03:45:09.793]  So yes, these are real threats and the American people are not made aware of them.
[03:45:10.793 --> 03:45:22.958]  What makes me angry is that they keep claiming in our news that the communist, uh, you know, you know, Chinese aren't a threat while they're making these threats and while they're expanding, while telling us that Russia is the existential threat and has to be dealt with.
[03:45:23.718 --> 03:45:29.563]  It is absolutely critical that we inform our fellow Americans and other people around the world about what's happening.
[03:45:29.924 --> 03:45:35.189]  Also, leftist-controlled CNN always spins this, that we're anti-Chinese or anti-Asian.
[03:45:35.769 --> 03:45:40.894]  The Communist Chinese have killed over 100 million of their own people, 80 plus million under Mao Zedong.
[03:45:41.434 --> 03:45:41.694]  Okay.
[03:45:42.535 --> 03:45:46.517]  So, let's be clear, this is not an anti-Asian operation or anti-Chinese operation.
[03:45:46.537 --> 03:45:47.197]  They're great people.
[03:45:47.937 --> 03:45:53.100]  They are under an exploitive, enslaved system that's being used to leverage out and take control of the world.
[03:45:53.460 --> 03:45:56.762]  Donald Trump is countering that and saying no more one-sided deals.
[03:45:57.082 --> 03:45:58.983]  Americanism, not globalism.
[03:45:59.524 --> 03:46:03.746]  But it is the communist Chinese, fascistic, crony-capitalist model.
[03:46:05.498 --> 03:46:08.585]  That is the enemy of any free, open society.
[03:46:08.866 --> 03:46:11.191]  And we must break its back and free the people of China.
[03:46:11.472 --> 03:46:12.534]  Back to Owen and the rest of the crew.
[03:46:13.473 --> 03:46:14.133]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:46:14.373 --> 03:46:20.395]  Now, before we went to break, we were talking about some stuff that's going on right now in D.C.
[03:46:20.775 --> 03:46:24.336]  around the inauguration, and I wanted to talk about this story.
[03:46:24.396 --> 03:46:25.537]  Commanding General of D.C.
[03:46:25.597 --> 03:46:27.077]  National Guard to be removed from post.
[03:46:27.117 --> 03:46:42.142]  Now, I was reading this story, and I was actually glad that I talked about this with Leanne before coming on air, because she actually reminded me about something that skipped my mind when I was reading this, how Trump has basically said all presidential appointments are essentially no longer effective as soon as he becomes president.
[03:46:42.342 --> 03:46:43.963]  So that explains the story more.
[03:46:44.023 --> 03:46:50.368]  But the interesting thing about this is, this is in the Washington Post, and it's basically saying the D.C.
[03:46:50.408 --> 03:46:55.511]  National Guard Major General Oral Schwartz is being forced to remove at 12.01 p.m.
[03:46:55.531 --> 03:46:58.293]  That's right after Trump will be inaugurated.
[03:46:58.313 --> 03:47:11.363]  It talks about how he had a big hand in protecting the inauguration, everything from protests, you know, terrorists, whatever else is going on, you know, obviously working with the police department and FBI, etc., etc., Secret Service.
[03:47:12.063 --> 03:47:20.548]  But it then goes on, and this was the part that was confusing to me, and then hearing you say what you think the reason is, and it makes sense, how come he wouldn't know this?
[03:47:21.129 --> 03:47:31.375]  He says, a quote, that he has not been told why he had to step down, and then he goes on to say, I'm a presidential nominee, therefore the president has the power to remove me.
[03:47:31.515 --> 03:47:33.956]  Do you think he's referring to Trump or Obama there?
[03:47:34.457 --> 03:47:37.519]  And do you think he knows that it was Trump's call to remove him?
[03:47:37.599 --> 03:47:39.280]  Or do you think maybe there's something else going on?
[03:47:39.360 --> 03:47:41.261]  Obviously Trump has not reached out and talked to him.
[03:47:41.641 --> 03:47:53.130]  Well yeah, was he given this order to be relieved at exactly 12.01 by President Obama, who's saying, you know what, take yourself out of there and let's see how much chaos we can create when the D.C.
[03:47:53.170 --> 03:47:55.131]  National Guard doesn't have a leader in place?
[03:47:55.672 --> 03:48:04.859]  Or is it because Donald Trump put out that call that all the presidential appointees needed to go as soon as he was nominated, as soon as he took his oath of office?
[03:48:05.319 --> 03:48:14.649]  So it'll be very interesting, especially when you consider the mass riots that are being called for with these people that are planning on protesting the inauguration.
[03:48:15.010 --> 03:48:18.814]  Protesters plan to paralyze the inauguration with traffic jams.
[03:48:20.976 --> 03:48:21.316]  She's nuts.
[03:48:39.372 --> 03:48:41.513]  But that's the thing, it would be the D.C.
[03:48:41.613 --> 03:48:47.075]  National Guard who would be called out to implement martial law.
[03:48:48.036 --> 03:48:52.358]  It's very interesting, we're kind of stuck there in a quagmire with what's going on.
[03:48:52.378 --> 03:48:54.739]  She is stuck in a quagmire, called her own mind.
[03:48:55.379 --> 03:48:58.103]  But it's crazy, and again, we're going to be at the inauguration.
[03:48:58.343 --> 03:49:03.629]  Make sure that you're at InfoWars.com and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube to keep up with all of our coverage there.
[03:49:03.649 --> 03:49:05.372]  I'm sure it's going to be absolutely wild.
[03:49:06.072 --> 03:49:07.034]  But it's already getting wild.
[03:49:07.054 --> 03:49:08.035]  We're already seeing the signs of it.
[03:49:08.095 --> 03:49:08.796]  You were talking about it.
[03:49:08.816 --> 03:49:11.739]  We're expecting, I think there might be millions of people there.
[03:49:11.779 --> 03:49:13.241]  I mean, this is going to be absolutely wild.
[03:49:13.281 --> 03:49:13.762]  Well, yeah.
[03:49:14.222 --> 03:49:14.622]  L.A.
[03:49:14.782 --> 03:49:16.303]  artist, I don't know if you saw this, Leigh-Anne, L.A.
[03:49:16.383 --> 03:49:19.864]  artist creates painting in blood as a Trump protest.
[03:49:19.944 --> 03:49:29.506]  A group of artists working on a Trump protest painting have now received more than 20 pints of blood that they are using to make the painting on the wall.
[03:49:29.546 --> 03:49:30.186]  How do you like that?
[03:49:30.286 --> 03:49:30.887]  It's art!
[03:49:30.907 --> 03:49:32.427]  This isn't a spirit cooking, mind you.
[03:49:32.447 --> 03:49:33.427]  You just don't get it.
[03:49:33.567 --> 03:49:33.987]  It is art.
[03:49:34.167 --> 03:49:35.348]  This isn't a spirit cooking.
[03:49:35.388 --> 03:49:40.689]  This is cutting yourself and then painting it on a wall to protest Donald Trump.
[03:49:40.709 --> 03:49:41.289]  In your own blood.
[03:49:41.389 --> 03:49:42.190]  How about this, Leigh-Anne?
[03:49:42.210 --> 03:49:43.270]  You think this will be effective?
[03:49:44.500 --> 03:49:45.320]  What do you think?
[03:49:45.401 --> 03:49:47.182]  You think a blood painting on the wall will do anything?
[03:49:47.202 --> 03:49:48.262]  You know what you're saying?
[03:49:48.282 --> 03:49:51.904]  You know what you're saying when you're making a Trump protest painting in blood?
[03:49:51.924 --> 03:49:52.825]  You know what you're actually saying?
[03:49:52.845 --> 03:49:52.925]  What?
[03:49:52.945 --> 03:49:53.465]  I'm crazy, I need help.
[03:50:09.511 --> 03:50:10.552]  Well, that's what you're saying.
[03:50:10.712 --> 03:50:12.174]  Nothing more, nothing less.
[03:50:12.394 --> 03:50:13.816]  I'm insane and I need help.
[03:50:13.956 --> 03:50:19.762]  Well, they're willing to draw a little blood with these mass riots and these protests that they're planning.
[03:50:19.782 --> 03:50:28.752]  Well, and then there was someone, one of the major organizers of a protest was asked about violence and he was basically kind of saying, you know, we're not condoning it, but you know, it's going to happen.
[03:50:29.092 --> 03:50:30.193]  So, okay, good for you.
[03:50:30.734 --> 03:50:32.475]  They hope he'll stop his swearing in.
[03:50:32.595 --> 03:50:33.936]  Here's what I would hope for you, though.
[03:50:34.016 --> 03:50:43.283]  I would hope that you don't plan any violence around the Bikers for Trump, because most of those guys are probably some big bad dudes who you don't want to mess with.
[03:50:43.744 --> 03:50:46.226]  Bikers for Trump vow to defend Trump inauguration.
[03:50:46.266 --> 03:50:48.507]  They are going to form a wall of protection.
[03:50:48.787 --> 03:50:54.332]  Chris Cox, Biker for Trump founder, has said that this is their plan during Trump's inauguration.
[03:50:54.432 --> 03:50:54.932]  I can't wait.
[03:50:55.132 --> 03:50:56.733]  I'm excited to see the Bikers for Trump.
[03:50:57.734 --> 03:51:01.562]  I hope maybe a couple of them want to form a wall around me, because I have a feeling that I'm going to be a target.
[03:51:01.803 --> 03:51:06.792]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show, on the other side, Owen Troyer, Lianne McAdoo with you for five more minutes.
[03:51:10.250 --> 03:51:16.051]  Wars are not cheap, and a lot of revolutionaries rob banks, you name it, to fund themselves.
[03:51:16.752 --> 03:51:19.532]  But I'm a restorationist, and I believe in Americana.
[03:51:20.092 --> 03:51:22.593]  I believe in the Renaissance, and that's why I harp on it constantly.
[03:51:23.213 --> 03:51:30.015]  And so we fund our operation by bringing you the very best game-changing, tip-of-the-spear products that are out there.
[03:51:30.375 --> 03:51:34.696]  And for us, things like game-changing, tip-of-the-spear, that's not rhetoric.
[03:51:35.316 --> 03:51:44.441]  That's why on major third-party sites, we get 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 reviews that nobody else gets by the thousands.
[03:51:45.342 --> 03:51:56.988]  Because we go out and do the research, the same ideas, the same research, the same technology, the same sources that we use to dominate the globalists politically and try to free this republic and the world.
[03:51:57.008 --> 03:51:59.130]  We apply to the products we bring in.
[03:52:00.030 --> 03:52:06.399]  And that's why we are now announcing a new special to kick off 2017 to make our bodies great again.
[03:52:07.020 --> 03:52:11.365]  Now, a lot of the nutraceuticals that we offer, over 25 that we've developed, have sold out.
[03:52:11.385 --> 03:52:12.647]  I think seven or eight have sold out.
[03:52:13.128 --> 03:52:15.150]  More coming in hopefully in the next few weeks, but they've...
[03:52:15.731 --> 03:52:16.131]  We're good to go.
[03:52:33.757 --> 03:52:34.978]  I've never claimed to be some beach boy.
[03:52:35.419 --> 03:52:36.379]  I was like that 20 years ago.
[03:52:36.399 --> 03:52:38.041]  I dedicated myself to working out.
[03:52:38.081 --> 03:52:38.661]  I was in great shape.
[03:52:38.681 --> 03:52:39.782]  I was dedicated to fighting the globalists.
[03:52:39.983 --> 03:52:40.643]  Gained a lot of weight.
[03:52:40.663 --> 03:52:44.907]  But I've lost over 60, 70 pounds of fat.
[03:52:45.087 --> 03:52:46.689]  I've probably gained 20, 30 pounds of muscle.
[03:52:46.709 --> 03:52:49.291]  I've actually tried to not even do that, but that's what's happened.
[03:52:49.491 --> 03:52:54.295]  Now, it's important to understand, when I get up here and tell people my views on this, I'm not lecturing you.
[03:52:54.835 --> 03:53:05.463]  I'm the worst about not even taking my own products, even though I know DNA Force is medical-grade, Japanese-developed, BioPQQ, you name it, 170-plus studies.
[03:53:05.503 --> 03:53:06.464]  We can make claims on this.
[03:53:06.504 --> 03:53:12.589]  This thing is like the Holy Grail, basically, of nerve regrowth, detoxification, antioxidant.
[03:53:13.349 --> 03:53:15.151]  I've got this at my fingertips, at cost.
[03:53:15.231 --> 03:53:16.012]  I forget to take it.
[03:53:16.032 --> 03:53:16.953]  I forget to give it to my kids.
[03:53:17.013 --> 03:53:18.855]  I forget to, you know, push it on my parents.
[03:53:18.935 --> 03:53:21.117]  This is God's gift to us through nature.
[03:53:21.577 --> 03:53:22.158]  Well, guess what?
[03:53:22.198 --> 03:53:23.419]  DNA Force is coming back in.
[03:53:23.799 --> 03:53:24.400]  It's discounted.
[03:53:24.680 --> 03:53:27.703]  Now in the next few weeks, a lot of these products that have sold out are coming back in.
[03:53:27.863 --> 03:53:29.125]  A lot of the products we have left
[03:53:29.665 --> 03:53:34.427]  We still have some supplies of it that will sell out soon, but I'm continuing to offer giant sales.
[03:53:34.807 --> 03:53:39.549]  Brain Force, our incredible nootropic, 20% more now in each bottle, 30% off.
[03:53:39.909 --> 03:53:41.910]  Super Mel Vitality, 30% off.

[03:53:45.792 --> 03:53:47.453]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.

[03:53:52.595 --> 03:53:54.476]  And many others at Infowarslife.com.
[03:53:55.376 --> 03:53:58.898]  You are literally energizing this operation against the globalists.
[03:53:58.978 --> 03:54:07.364]  I want to, again, salute you all and ask you to go check out the amazing specials we've got running right now for 2017 in the month of January.
[03:54:07.564 --> 03:54:08.684]  Make our bodies great again.
[03:54:12.867 --> 03:54:18.891]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:54:19.511 --> 03:54:22.473]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:26.676 --> 03:54:29.378]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, fourth hour, final segment.
[03:54:29.458 --> 03:54:31.139]  Owen Schroer, LeeAnne McAdoo with you.
[03:54:31.159 --> 03:54:38.805]  And in case you haven't heard, we have some amazing body armor available right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:54:39.125 --> 03:54:45.230]  The most advanced body armor on the market right now, and it is being sold at a ridiculous price.
[03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:52.735]  This is some of the lightest, most comfortable body armor that you can find on the market, and it's also some of the strongest too.
[03:54:53.736 --> 03:55:00.040]  And it's amazing to think that you might need something like this, but this is the times that we live in, obviously.
[03:55:00.060 --> 03:55:04.122]  You know, it's amazing, you know, this shooting that just happened at the Fort Lauderdale Airport.
[03:55:04.142 --> 03:55:16.489]  You talk about, you know, David talks about getting that, the backpack body armor that we have that's just basically a flat shield that you can put in the backpack to protect your child if they're at the airport or a school shooting.
[03:55:16.529 --> 03:55:20.492]  We've obviously, you know, seen these things happen in the past.
[03:55:21.172 --> 03:55:40.600]  Uh, but it's amazing, you know, we live in these times where you might need body armor, and I was just thinking about this, how that whole Fort Lauderdale shooting kind of just ended up being a 24-hour news cycle story, um, but there's a reason why people want to get body armor like this, because they want to be able to wear it, they want it to be practical, but they want it to protect them.
[03:55:40.660 --> 03:55:41.781]  They want it to save their life.
[03:55:42.381 --> 03:55:44.403]  And that's what this body armor can do for you.
[03:55:44.463 --> 03:55:49.406]  Again, this is some of the most advanced body armor that you can find at the best price.
[03:55:49.767 --> 03:55:51.388]  Protect yourself, protect your children.
[03:55:51.848 --> 03:55:52.989]  Go check it out.
[03:55:53.149 --> 03:55:54.290]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:55:54.310 --> 03:55:55.411]  Check out that body armor.
[03:55:55.491 --> 03:55:59.934]  I promise you, just like the DNA Force, soon they'll be talking about this as groundbreaking.
[03:56:00.014 --> 03:56:00.955]  Well, we broke it first.
[03:56:01.435 --> 03:56:04.899]  That backpack could also be really good during all these protests coming up too.
[03:56:04.919 --> 03:56:05.320]  You know what?
[03:56:05.340 --> 03:56:05.941]  I'm glad you said that.
[03:56:05.961 --> 03:56:11.207]  Protect all of your equipment there from any of the gas canisters that might be fired at protesters.
[03:56:11.407 --> 03:56:12.529]  Or who else?
[03:56:12.609 --> 03:56:15.112]  A lot of journalists out there might need something like that.
[03:56:15.132 --> 03:56:18.315]  I'm going to have to wear a helmet going to this thing.
[03:56:18.355 --> 03:56:20.017]  My goodness, it's going to be crazy.
[03:56:20.891 --> 03:56:22.611]  Alright, what do we want to finish off with?
[03:56:23.052 --> 03:56:23.892]  Let's see, Leanne.
[03:56:24.032 --> 03:56:25.472]  Oh, actually, I wanted to mention this.
[03:56:25.592 --> 03:56:26.692]  It is now official.
[03:56:27.193 --> 03:56:33.774]  The House has joined the Senate in approving the 2017 budget blueprint.
[03:56:34.154 --> 03:56:36.795]  The first step towards dismantling the Affordable Care Act.
[03:56:36.875 --> 03:56:38.015]  So there you go, it's now final.
[03:56:38.035 --> 03:56:39.536]  They've held the vote on both sides.
[03:56:40.196 --> 03:56:44.277]  Nanny nanny boo boo, liberal tears, we'll water my garden for the entire year.
[03:56:44.537 --> 03:56:45.418]  I'm a little bittersweet.
[03:56:45.518 --> 03:56:55.285]  I saw Rand Paul standing up against that and just being very disappointed with how much debt that is going to levy to the American taxpayer with that budget.
[03:56:56.357 --> 03:56:58.737]  Well, unfortunately... Maybe we'll talk a little more about that on the Nightly News tonight.
[03:56:58.858 --> 03:57:09.980]  Unfortunately, that debt is so out of control and it's going to take more than just one aspect of government spending to reel that problem... Pints of our blood?
[03:57:10.000 --> 03:57:14.200]  20 pints of blood for an anti-Trump protest that says nothing more than I'm crazy.
[03:57:14.220 --> 03:57:14.661]  Good luck with that.
[03:57:15.101 --> 03:57:19.121]  Hey, wasn't Whoopi Goldberg supposed to leave the country if Donald Trump won?
[03:57:19.782 --> 03:57:21.562]  Unfortunately, I think she's still here.
[03:57:22.382 --> 03:57:25.104]  And she's decided to open her big mouth again.
[03:57:25.204 --> 03:57:29.487]  Whoopi Goldberg isn't here for Kanye West's recent comments.
[03:57:29.527 --> 03:57:30.949]  Calls him an idiot boy.
[03:57:31.429 --> 03:57:36.773]  So now Whoopi Goldberg is calling out Kanye West for Trumping while black.
[03:57:37.573 --> 03:57:44.578]  And again, I'm pretty sure Whoopi Goldberg was one of the celebrities who said they would leave the country if Trump won.
[03:57:45.478 --> 03:57:46.919]  Yeah, there she is right there.
[03:57:47.640 --> 03:57:48.961]  Aww, poor little Whoopi.
[03:57:49.302 --> 03:57:51.444]  I guess things are better in America after all.
[03:57:52.064 --> 03:57:54.286]  Aren't things nice in America after all, Whoopi?
[03:57:54.306 --> 03:58:00.832]  We had Steve Harvey actually just left the Trump Tower and said he had a great meeting with him and he thinks that he's the real deal.
[03:58:00.912 --> 03:58:05.336]  So I think there's a lot of people out there that are not afraid of Trumping while black.
[03:58:05.356 --> 03:58:10.201]  And that's the thing too, is once these people meet Trump and speak to him, they're like, oh the media was lying, this is actually a nice guy.
[03:58:10.501 --> 03:58:11.082]  Here we go, though.
[03:58:11.322 --> 03:58:12.243]  Burning memorabilia.
[03:58:12.283 --> 03:58:14.885]  The Chargers are now leaving Chicago.
[03:58:15.025 --> 03:58:17.227]  And what are football fans in San Diego doing?
[03:58:17.547 --> 03:58:19.209]  They're burning all their memorabilia.
[03:58:19.489 --> 03:58:25.234]  These people care more about losing their football team than losing their country, their freedom, or their future.
[03:58:25.494 --> 03:58:27.116]  This is what needs to change in this country.
[03:58:27.196 --> 03:58:27.996]  Thank you, Leanne.
[03:58:28.277 --> 03:58:28.957]  Thank you, David Knight.
[03:58:28.977 --> 03:58:29.618]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:58:29.638 --> 03:58:30.699]  Thank you to the entire crew.
[03:58:31.039 --> 03:58:32.941]  The Alex Jones Show will be back next Monday.
[03:58:33.101 --> 03:58:34.922]  It's Inauguration Week next week, folks.

[03:58:40.466 --> 03:58:40.986]  Sunday Show!
[03:58:41.026 --> 03:58:41.547]  Sunday Show!

[03:59:02.464 --> 03:59:05.746]  What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the FBI?
[03:59:05.887 --> 03:59:07.648]  Based on the information they had, she should
