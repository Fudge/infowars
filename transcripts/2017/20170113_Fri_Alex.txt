[00:00:14.893 --> 00:00:19.735]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:26.299]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:28.160]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we are.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.280]  It's Friday.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.824]  We're only seven days out from Donald Trump being inaugurated the 45th president of the United States.
[00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:39.165]  They're already on the verge of repealing Obamacare.
[00:00:40.052 --> 00:00:47.338]  Every week, tens of billions of dollars of more jobs are announced to come back to the United States, the latest Chrysler plants.
[00:00:47.338 --> 00:00:51.762]  We are seeing him come out against vaccines.
[00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:54.424]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I told you that was coming.
[00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:57.006]  This is unbelievable.
[00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:58.047]  We are seeing him.
[00:00:59.014 --> 00:01:05.978]  Openly move to get over a trillion dollars of money back in the United States by changing our tax laws to expose the globalists.
[00:01:05.978 --> 00:01:11.141]  I have the cover of USA Today here in front of me with their weekend edition.
[00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:14.303]  Trump's cabinet of disruptors ready to go.
[00:01:14.303 --> 00:01:19.346]  That's right, they're going to disrupt the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:19.346 --> 00:01:26.591]  And all the things Trump is delivering on in spades, and he has committed to the American people, he's committed to me.
[00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:30.944]  I'm going to just leave it at that so the media doesn't have another heyday with it.
[00:01:30.944 --> 00:01:34.585]  That he's going to deliver or basically die trying.
[00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:36.326]  He is going all out.
[00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:45.289]  And that's why we're seeing this unprecedented move, this unprecedented move right now to disrupt the inauguration.
[00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:50.139]  And to actually try to sell the American people on an overthrow of Trump.
[00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:58.942]  The establishment, the globalists, are trying to convince themselves that they can try some coup with Obama with seven days left.
[00:01:58.942 --> 00:02:09.385]  Now, remember, in the last month I've been warning you that they're trying to launch a Continued Government, COG, basically Operation Valkyrie.
[00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:10.245]  They use COG
[00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:17.596]  In 1944, to try to kill Hitler, they're caught in a new government system, but it backfired.
[00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:19.077]  Well, they've turned that around now.
[00:02:19.077 --> 00:02:21.299]  They're acting like Trump is illegitimate.
[00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:28.845]  They're trying to sell COG through rogue groups in the government to convince them that what they're doing is okay and normal.
[00:02:28.845 --> 00:02:38.593]  And I've said the left is openly behind the scenes calling for martial law and the arrest of Trump or the blocking of Trump and then a quote, new election.
[00:02:39.463 --> 00:02:45.129]  That's why Homeland Security last week announced the federalization and total control of elections.
[00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.375]  People said, well, he'll be gone in 10 days or so, you know, last week or 12 days, whatever it was.
[00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:54.580]  But see, not if they suspend this election and say it was fraudulent.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.542]  They're seriously thinking about it.
[00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:58.625]  Now, Rosie O'Donnell is one of the top people
[00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:01.547]  In the New York Hollywood scene.
[00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:04.869]  She's a has-been, but she's a darling with the elites.
[00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:11.074]  And she has put out an article in Yahoo, we'll put it up on Infowars.com for everybody right now.
[00:03:11.074 --> 00:03:20.341]  She has come out and openly said that she wants the election suspended because she's a quote, Russian agent, until that can be cleared up.
[00:03:20.341 --> 00:03:22.763]  Of course, it'll never be cleared up, they're the ones running with this info.
[00:03:22.763 --> 00:03:25.645]  And that she wants martial law in place.
[00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:27.626]  Now, CNN
[00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:40.067]  CNN just three weeks ago had a talking point that they put out that I put a lot of attention on where they said civil emergency, national emergency.
[00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:43.129]  I then talked to my sources at CNN.
[00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.309]  We also have sources inside ABC News.
[00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:46.330]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:03:46.910 --> 00:04:05.740]  And they said that they are seriously wargaming, just like they got caught before the Gulf War both times, in 1991 and 2003, wargaming the attacks with the exact targets drilled beforehand with a seamless integration of federal government, Pentagon media, through the media.
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.101]  They are actually wargaming.
[00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:09.342]  And I'm going to announce this on the other side of the break with David Knight.
[00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:13.250]  That's what I'm working on behind the scenes.
[00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.992]  This is not turning into a vacation, it's turning into an on-the-road emergency transmission.
[00:04:17.992 --> 00:04:26.895]  But bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, they are seriously, notice you heard this from me first, because we have the sources, now you see it actually materializing seven days out.
[00:04:26.895 --> 00:04:28.136]  David Knight, this is incredible.
[00:04:29.855 --> 00:04:36.978]  Alex, and of course, when we look at Rosie O'Donnell, we could say that it's just the rantings of somebody who's a failure.
[00:04:36.978 --> 00:04:40.339]  But this is something that has been promoted by George Soros.
[00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:46.242]  We're going to talk to Michael Snyder today, and he breaks down this group that is going to try to disrupt the inauguration.
[00:04:46.242 --> 00:04:46.842]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.615 --> 00:05:02.356]  Here's Donald Trump on Twitter today.
[00:05:02.356 --> 00:05:03.196]  He also tweeted, Amen.
[00:05:03.196 --> 00:05:04.596]  Now, here is Rosie O'Donnell on Twitter.
[00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:33.548]  I fully support imposing martial law, delaying the inauguration, until Trump is cleared of all charges.
[00:05:33.548 --> 00:05:36.270]  All her hearsay mafia minion followers agreed.
[00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.353]  The only problem with that is, there are no charges to be cleared!
[00:05:40.353 --> 00:05:42.414]  Just fake news allegations that you fall for.
[00:05:42.754 --> 00:05:44.695]  Remember her side of the fence before the election?
[00:05:44.695 --> 00:05:46.256]  When they go low, we go high.
[00:05:46.256 --> 00:05:48.437]  Trump and Republicans need to accept the results.
[00:05:48.437 --> 00:05:49.358]  So much for that.
[00:05:49.358 --> 00:05:50.719]  Two things were confirmed today.
[00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:52.059]  Trump on Twitter is awesome.
[00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:55.061]  And Rosie O'Donnell is a hypocritical wine bag moron.
[00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:56.422]  Job of the HUD in the flesh.
[00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:58.503]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com

[00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:06.551]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:19.334]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[00:07:19.534 --> 00:07:23.195]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:07:23.195 --> 00:07:30.178]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[00:07:30.178 --> 00:07:43.043]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:07:43.043 --> 00:07:44.584]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:07:44.884 --> 00:07:51.273]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[00:07:51.273 --> 00:07:56.220]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:08:17.174 --> 00:08:22.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:29.548]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:29.548 --> 00:08:33.513]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday the 13th, 2017.
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:38.780]  That's right.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.462]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:40.462 --> 00:08:44.804]  We are now looking at seven days out of number 45.
[00:08:44.804 --> 00:08:49.067]  President-elect Donald Trump becoming the 45th President of the United States.
[00:08:49.067 --> 00:08:50.648]  I'm going to be here to the bottom of the hour.
[00:08:50.648 --> 00:08:53.230]  David Knight is going to be hot-showing this broadcast.
[00:08:53.230 --> 00:09:05.017]  Again, I will be back in the saddle early next week, and I'll be obviously breaking some very important news over the weekend, if I'm given the green light.
[00:09:05.017 --> 00:09:06.258]  And believe me,
[00:09:07.168 --> 00:09:08.831]  I want to be given the green light.
[00:09:08.831 --> 00:09:11.475]  I do not like sitting on this.
[00:09:11.475 --> 00:09:16.503]  But let's just say this, we're living inside a Tom Clancy novel right now, folks.
[00:09:16.503 --> 00:09:21.791]  But to be a Tom Clancy novel, so fantastic, no one would believe it, because the truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:09:23.287 --> 00:09:33.851]  Now, David Knight's going to be augmenting what I'm saying because there's so much evidence that when he popped in during the last segment, if he just joined us, he added key intel to all of it that I hadn't even gotten to.
[00:09:33.851 --> 00:09:35.851]  So we're going to be going back and forth here.
[00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:37.552]  But first, let me lay this down for you.
[00:09:37.552 --> 00:09:49.836]  I first began to tell you over a month ago that CNN, ABC, and others were going to start promoting the idea of a civil emergency, a national emergency,
[00:09:50.834 --> 00:09:58.718]  A national security emergency, a continuity of government emergency, or a COG.
[00:09:58.718 --> 00:10:08.684]  Now, under a COG, if a president was actually a foreign agent and that was confirmed, you'd have to have congressional emergency hearings and things like that for it to be constitutional.
[00:10:08.684 --> 00:10:12.706]  The shadow government, the deep state that is publicly attacking Trump now,
[00:10:14.252 --> 00:10:17.235]  It doesn't intend to go that route because they are the deep state.
[00:10:17.235 --> 00:10:18.716]  They are actually the foreigners.
[00:10:18.716 --> 00:10:19.837]  They're actually the globalists.
[00:10:19.837 --> 00:10:24.622]  They're actually the people that have infiltrated the government and are overthrowing our republic.
[00:10:24.622 --> 00:10:26.444]  Trump is returning the republic.
[00:10:26.444 --> 00:10:33.010]  Trump is trying to disrupt the globalist operation to impoverish us and make us vassal slaves.
[00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.571]  I'm going to break all that down.
[00:10:34.571 --> 00:10:36.913]  But here's the big news.
[00:10:36.913 --> 00:10:38.295]  Over and over again I've told you
[00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.892]  And I'm going to go ahead and just release the information today.
[00:10:41.892 --> 00:10:51.159]  I was told over a month ago by sources inside CNN, inside ABC, and others, they said, Alex, you are dead on.
[00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:52.800]  We're up here wargaming.
[00:10:54.079 --> 00:11:11.173]  Civil unrest in and around the inauguration, Trump being arrested, Trump being indicted, the news announcing he's a Russian spy, basically overthrowing the president, putting it into a constitutional crisis, and a national emergency being declared.
[00:11:11.173 --> 00:11:15.937]  So I'm being told this by sources.
[00:11:15.937 --> 00:11:19.180]  One mid-level, one, let's just say high-level.
[00:11:20.578 --> 00:11:22.799]  But on the edge of CNN.
[00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:24.440]  Let's just say a consultant.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.680]  That's what's going on.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.181]  That's what's thematically being prepared.
[00:11:28.181 --> 00:11:31.302]  They're having to get their own people prepared and lined up.
[00:11:31.302 --> 00:11:47.189]  Just like we saw before the first Gulf War in 1991, and then in 2003, it leaked that ABC, CBS, CNN, all up months before were wargaming with the actual graphics, the attacks that happened, in the exact order they happened, because media was interfacing
[00:11:48.568 --> 00:11:51.571]  With the Pentagon to have seamless propaganda.
[00:11:51.571 --> 00:11:53.273]  Well, let me just explain something.
[00:11:53.273 --> 00:11:54.594]  They are prepping.
[00:11:54.594 --> 00:12:00.740]  They are doing, like when you go have a wedding, well, you know, the day before you'll have a dress rehearsal.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.801]  They've had rehearsals.
[00:12:01.801 --> 00:12:03.702]  They've had dress rehearsals.
[00:12:03.702 --> 00:12:05.784]  Now they've started to sell the public on the idea.
[00:12:05.784 --> 00:12:12.070]  Then, after we first talked about that, they began to say on CNN, we need a civil emergency.
[00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.912]  We need a national emergency.
[00:12:15.303 --> 00:12:24.187]  To clear up whether or not Trump is a Russian agent, or if these electors don't go for him, we're going to need this crisis as well.
[00:12:24.187 --> 00:12:27.289]  We're going to need this system to take care of the crisis.
[00:12:27.289 --> 00:12:40.835]  Now, it's been intensifying with these rogue intelligence agencies coming out with reports that Russians turned off the East Coast power, or that Russians plan to turn off the East Coast, or that they had a laptop, and then, okay, the laptop
[00:12:41.954 --> 00:12:42.534]  Hmm.
[00:12:42.534 --> 00:12:44.115]  Didn't even have the software on it.
[00:12:44.115 --> 00:12:45.616]  It's all totally made up.
[00:12:45.616 --> 00:12:47.737]  We've seen hoax after hoax after hoax after hoax.
[00:12:47.737 --> 00:12:49.899]  We've seen three lawsuits saying he raped young girls.
[00:12:49.899 --> 00:12:50.879]  Fake names.
[00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:52.100]  Totally made up.
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.541]  But we're all supposed to forget about those.
[00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:58.864]  Now, Rosie O'Donnell, who is a has-been, but that doesn't matter.
[00:12:58.864 --> 00:13:02.786]  In Manhattan, she is a absolute darling.
[00:13:03.656 --> 00:13:04.557]  Of the establishment.
[00:13:04.557 --> 00:13:05.837]  She's dialed into everything.
[00:13:05.837 --> 00:13:10.140]  At the national level, she's seen as the nemesis of Trump.
[00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:21.866]  She comes out uncharacteristically technical with the terms she used that are the exact script they're planning to use if they try to overthrow our president and the return of our republic.
[00:13:21.866 --> 00:13:23.627]  This is from Yahoo News.
[00:13:23.627 --> 00:13:26.609]  Trump's nemesis, Rosie O'Donnell, calls for martial law.
[00:13:27.739 --> 00:13:28.480]  That's yesterday.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:32.586]  Donald Trump ripped Rosie O'Donnell during his first Republican presidential debate.
[00:13:32.586 --> 00:13:37.773]  We'll see he deserves it, saying that she was the only woman about whom he'd ever made disparaging comments.
[00:13:37.773 --> 00:13:44.702]  Now, with less than 10 days until Trump takes the Oval Office, O'Donnell says that she'd support martial law.
[00:13:44.702 --> 00:13:45.243]  That's a quote.
[00:13:46.599 --> 00:13:49.722]  In order to delay his inauguration.
[00:13:49.722 --> 00:13:51.263]  Fully support imposing martial law.
[00:13:51.263 --> 00:13:52.324]  This is a quote.
[00:13:52.324 --> 00:13:53.205]  All caps.
[00:13:53.205 --> 00:13:55.006]  Fully support imposing martial law.
[00:13:55.006 --> 00:13:59.490]  Delaying the inauguration until Trump is cleared of all charges.
[00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.392]  I am fully support martial law.
[00:14:01.392 --> 00:14:03.074]  She goes on from there.
[00:14:03.074 --> 00:14:06.697]  So, again, they are trying to sell this idea.
[00:14:06.697 --> 00:14:08.498]  They are wargaming it.
[00:14:08.498 --> 00:14:10.880]  They are preparing it to the point that on ABC
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:17.904]  CNN, MSNBC, anybody can search these terms and pull up these transcripts.
[00:14:17.904 --> 00:14:24.749]  In the last month, they've started floating, national emergency, national emergency, national emergency.
[00:14:24.749 --> 00:14:35.677]  We need Obama to declare a national emergency, then they'll announce they're having an investigation for six months until there's a new election.
[00:14:35.677 --> 00:14:39.740]  You see, and then, oh, even if there is a new election, Homeland Security, here's the key,
[00:14:41.332 --> 00:14:44.113]  Federalized the elections last week.
[00:14:44.113 --> 00:14:51.315]  Now remember, I told you that, I told you that a month before they actually came out and announced they were going to start the process.
[00:14:51.315 --> 00:14:53.356]  That was a month and a half before the election.
[00:14:53.356 --> 00:14:56.317]  Now people keep asking, how do I keep predicting all this?
[00:14:56.317 --> 00:14:58.398]  Do I have a magical crystal ball?
[00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:08.501]  No, ladies and gentlemen, I have sources throughout the Pentagon, throughout the CIA, throughout the FBI, throughout the federal marshals, and I've got sources even above that.
[00:15:08.501 --> 00:15:10.342]  I've been on the phone the last week
[00:15:10.956 --> 00:15:12.157]  With people.
[00:15:12.157 --> 00:15:13.938]  In this government.
[00:15:13.938 --> 00:15:15.199]  At the highest levels.
[00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:19.282]  I just want listeners to understand, this is not smoke you're getting here.
[00:15:19.282 --> 00:15:21.704]  This is hardcore reality.
[00:15:21.704 --> 00:15:28.709]  And if people think the globalists aren't going to try something when their whole world government is going down in flames worldwide.
[00:15:28.709 --> 00:15:30.390]  Think again.
[00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.672]  The whole table is set.
[00:15:32.672 --> 00:15:34.714]  Meanwhile, another big tell.
[00:15:34.714 --> 00:15:36.815]  And this is an intel I got from sources.
[00:15:36.815 --> 00:15:38.557]  This is what I saw with my eyeballs.
[00:15:38.557 --> 00:15:40.418]  That's usually the best intel for anybody, isn't it?
[00:15:41.036 --> 00:15:47.960]  George Soros doubled the week after the huge upset on November 8, 2016.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:16:03.429]  He doubled the amount of money he was giving to the Black Lives Matter, the communist groups, the Ford Foundation groups, the destabilization groups, the groups calling for civil unrest, burning down cities, killing cops, knockout game, all this garbage.
[00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:05.651]  And I thought, well, maybe he's just being vindictive.
[00:16:05.651 --> 00:16:07.552]  Then I saw the big foundations
[00:16:08.476 --> 00:16:15.940]  And I saw, you know, everybody from Kellogg's to the Ford Foundation massively increase what they were giving in one week.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.863]  They were giving $1 million, $2 million, $3 million, $5 million apiece.
[00:16:19.863 --> 00:16:25.306]  Over 30 major corporations were giving over a million apiece, some $3-$4 million.
[00:16:25.306 --> 00:16:27.547]  Soros gave $100 million additional that week.
[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:40.647]  So, ladies and gentlemen, we're talking about a massive, massive, quadrupling down ahead of this inauguration with them busing in, reportedly, hundreds of thousands of agitators.
[00:16:40.647 --> 00:16:41.748]  We have it in the WikiLeaks.
[00:16:41.748 --> 00:16:42.969]  They give them drugs.
[00:16:42.969 --> 00:16:44.810]  They give them alcohol.
[00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.071]  They pay the average person $200 a day.
[00:16:47.071 --> 00:16:52.955]  Some agitators are paid $1,400 a day to physically attack people.
[00:16:52.955 --> 00:16:55.196]  Then Soros' lawyers get them out of prison.
[00:16:55.196 --> 00:16:56.677]  This guy's overthrown Ukraine.
[00:16:57.483 --> 00:17:00.285]  This guy's over from the Middle East or the Arab Spring.
[00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:06.590]  They mean business, and their mouths are wet with the blood of the innocents.
[00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:11.394]  They've got a bloodthirsty taste of victory in all these other countries, and they really think they can do this.
[00:17:11.394 --> 00:17:13.115]  Trump is aware of what's going on.
[00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:18.018]  Trump has plans in place, but everybody better know this.
[00:17:18.018 --> 00:17:19.139]  Be ready to call C-SPAN.
[00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:20.380]  Be ready to call talk radio.
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:25.144]  Be ready to really take action, get a buzz going out there, but they better not try martial law.
[00:17:26.312 --> 00:17:32.098]  Because that's the kind of thing that can spook them off of doing this if their program is exposed.
[00:17:32.098 --> 00:17:43.929]  And another thing Trump needs to do, he needs to get into the hack that happened two years ago that we learned about last year, the OPM hack of $14 million, then we learned $20 million.
[00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:47.430]  I don't know.
[00:18:07.346 --> 00:18:09.729]  To roll us up to the Communist Chinese.
[00:18:09.729 --> 00:18:19.660]  That's part of Obama's ongoing sabotage of the country that we see all over the place that he admits he's carrying out with his scorched earth operation.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:27.390]  So we've got all of this unfolding and if you add on top of that, and again this is what Trump needs to do,
[00:18:28.539 --> 00:18:32.683]  He needs to come out and say, Hillary, you got money from the Communist Chinese.
[00:18:32.683 --> 00:18:34.445]  You got money from the Saudi Arabians.
[00:18:34.445 --> 00:18:39.490]  Here are the newspapers where they bragged they gave you money, and where the whole media was on your side.
[00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.211]  Stop changing the subject onto Russia.
[00:18:41.211 --> 00:18:42.292]  You're a liar.
[00:18:42.292 --> 00:18:45.936]  Your, you know, podesta people took 30-something million from the Russians.
[00:18:45.936 --> 00:18:47.737]  You met with Putin in secret.
[00:18:47.737 --> 00:18:50.600]  And so stop claiming that I've done what you've done.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.322]  If he hits her with that, it's over.
[00:18:53.081 --> 00:19:02.049]  And I know Trump's got a lot of stuff going on in his mind, and he's got Spicer advising him, which is fine, but I'm seeing a lot of softballs being thrown back by Spicer and others.
[00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:05.332]  Every time the President elects those balls, they're hard.
[00:19:05.332 --> 00:19:14.900]  We pointed out the whole hack last week via tweet, but one tweet about the Office of Personnel Management, that is not enough.
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.563]  We need to hammer the daylights out of this, but let's back up for a moment.
[00:19:19.656 --> 00:19:26.710]  I'm going to bring David Knight in here because he's got Mr. Schneider coming on for a full hour to break all this down and go over every facet of this.
[00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:30.838]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're nakedly saying they want to overturn the election.
[00:19:31.696 --> 00:19:36.398]  They're nakedly trying with the electors and the recounts and all the rest of it.
[00:19:36.398 --> 00:19:42.340]  And remember, every time they were trying that, they'd say, well, we're not trying to have the electors overturn the election.
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.941]  That's a conspiracy theory of Alex Jones.
[00:19:44.941 --> 00:19:47.562]  Remember Nancy Pelosi's daughter leading the effort?
[00:19:47.562 --> 00:19:49.383]  And she said, I'm getting death threats.
[00:19:49.383 --> 00:19:52.524]  Alex Jones wants to be dead on Cavuto.
[00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:54.245]  Totally made up.
[00:19:54.245 --> 00:19:55.365]  No, I'm not threatening her.
[00:19:55.365 --> 00:19:56.525]  I'm not saying go after her.
[00:19:56.525 --> 00:19:57.826]  I said, she's leading the charge.
[00:19:58.698 --> 00:20:03.821]  They have the electors overturn this election, put things into crisis, federalize the election.
[00:20:03.821 --> 00:20:05.441]  This is a soft coup.
[00:20:05.441 --> 00:20:08.883]  Well, they're pissed because I called them on what they were doing.
[00:20:08.883 --> 00:20:18.608]  Pelosi then went and literally tried to get Loretta Lynch to cook up some federal lawsuit before they left office to try to have me basically indicted.
[00:20:20.137 --> 00:20:25.860]  I mean, these people are that crazy that her daughter is running around trying to overturn the election.
[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.501]  I call her on it.
[00:20:27.501 --> 00:20:29.762]  She goes and cries to mommy.
[00:20:29.762 --> 00:20:32.843]  I tell everybody about it in the morning at 11 a.m.
[00:20:32.843 --> 00:20:37.586]  and then that afternoon she's on Kabuto saying the exact thing on national TV.
[00:20:37.586 --> 00:20:39.007]  What I'm telling you listeners is...
[00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.071]  I'm not bragging about the show.
[00:20:42.071 --> 00:20:45.574]  I'm telling you, this is the broadcast the intelligence agencies listen to.
[00:20:45.574 --> 00:20:48.015]  This is what the President-elect listens to.
[00:20:48.015 --> 00:20:50.657]  This is what anybody who's got half a brain listens to.
[00:20:50.657 --> 00:20:52.318]  This is what drugs listens to.
[00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:55.020]  It's what Congress listens to, because they listen to you.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.982]  It isn't about Alex Jones.
[00:20:56.982 --> 00:21:02.766]  It's about the family of listeners and activists and guest hosts and all of us together are the Brain Trust.
[00:21:03.286 --> 00:21:04.987]  And we are the source.
[00:21:04.987 --> 00:21:12.912]  We're given the information to respond to the globalists, and the info I've been given from our sources has been 100% dead on.
[00:21:12.912 --> 00:21:14.593]  There is a real resistance.
[00:21:14.593 --> 00:21:19.856]  This country is in total crisis, but amazing historical things are happening right now.
[00:21:19.856 --> 00:21:21.897]  Now, David Knight, I've laid out a lot of points here.
[00:21:21.897 --> 00:21:24.859]  They're prepping the public for a civil emergency.
[00:21:25.926 --> 00:21:29.930]  That's a fancy term for martial law, just like a bunch of made-up internet crap.
[00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:33.353]  It's not just some sleazy, you know, internet message board.
[00:21:33.353 --> 00:21:35.094]  You call it a dossier.
[00:21:35.094 --> 00:21:38.217]  Well, if you're preparing martial law, you don't call it martial law.
[00:21:38.217 --> 00:21:52.409]  You call it national emergency, with Obama making it all racial, coming out, triggering riots nationwide, claiming the people don't accept Trump, they don't accept a Russian agent, he's got to accept emergency
[00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:54.851]  I don't know.
[00:22:18.144 --> 00:22:18.544]  We're good.
[00:22:41.757 --> 00:22:47.936]  From Nancy Pelosi and Soros and he's too busy crying and bitching and complaining that his legacy of
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.561]  Killing this country is being overthrown.
[00:22:50.561 --> 00:22:56.105]  He's too busy giving Biden the Medal of Freedom award, where both of them cry as narcissistic loons.
[00:22:56.105 --> 00:23:03.269]  He's too busy saying, we'll take anybody from anywhere in the world with no evidence of who you are, known jihadis, you name it.
[00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:06.211]  But if the Cubans are fleeing tyranny, they can't come here.
[00:23:06.211 --> 00:23:08.912]  He's just enacted that with eight days out.
[00:23:08.912 --> 00:23:10.814]  We're now seven days out.
[00:23:10.814 --> 00:23:16.277]  And here on Friday the 13th, I want the listeners to understand the incredible historic
[00:23:16.937 --> 00:23:21.479]  Life-changing, once-in-a-lifetime events that we're seeing unfold.
[00:23:21.479 --> 00:23:24.661]  David, what do you think of this overall breakdown I put out there?
[00:23:24.661 --> 00:23:29.583]  Isn't it interesting, Alex, one of the last things you mentioned is Obama's move now against Cubans.
[00:23:29.583 --> 00:23:34.485]  I grew up in Florida, I knew a lot of Cubans, and they were real free market people.
[00:23:34.485 --> 00:23:39.107]  And so that's the only group that Obama doesn't want to have come in the United States.
[00:23:40.127 --> 00:23:41.068]  I think that's kind of interesting.
[00:23:41.068 --> 00:23:48.334]  But when you're talking about Soros, we look at Rosie O'Donnell, and clearly the rhetoric that she's got out here is inflammatory.
[00:23:48.334 --> 00:24:00.603]  But the issue is, whether wittingly or unwittingly, what she's doing is supporting the efforts of George Soros, Bill Ayers, Black Lives Matter, and the rest of these people who, the day after the election, started with violence.
[00:24:00.603 --> 00:24:03.005]  Now, Michael Snyder that's coming up in the next hour, Alex,
[00:24:03.585 --> 00:24:15.777]  He pointed out in this article some of the more moderate groups are talking about things like civil resistance, civil disobedience, but the others are openly talking about blockades, they're talking about citywide paralysis, and listen Alex to who this is.
[00:24:15.777 --> 00:24:27.049]  People like Cornel West, or Educator, put that word in quotes, Educator Bill Ayers, and Carl Dix of the Communist Party USA, and their group is called Disrupt J20, Disrupt January the 20th.
[00:24:27.589 --> 00:24:30.391]  So we're going to be talking to him about that in the next hour.
[00:24:30.391 --> 00:24:31.792]  But that's precisely what this is.
[00:24:31.792 --> 00:24:36.054]  And yesterday, Glenn Greenwald said, look, the left is going hysterical.
[00:24:36.054 --> 00:24:37.595]  They're losing.
[00:24:37.595 --> 00:24:39.276]  They lost to Trump, and they're upset about that.
[00:24:39.276 --> 00:24:43.299]  So he says, if you don't like their policies, and Glenn Greenwald said, I don't like Trump.
[00:24:43.299 --> 00:24:46.481]  But I'm going to oppose him in the marketplace of ideas.
[00:24:46.481 --> 00:24:56.867]  There's other ways to do this other than embracing the kind of tactics that have been used in other countries to overthrow their governments by the CIA and embracing that here at home.
[00:24:57.227 --> 00:24:58.128]  And that's the real issue.
[00:24:58.128 --> 00:24:58.668]  That's what he said.
[00:24:58.668 --> 00:25:02.110]  The deep state has come out and declared war against Donald Trump.
[00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:02.451]  That's right.
[00:25:02.451 --> 00:25:05.933]  The deep state exactly has declared war against Donald Trump.
[00:25:05.933 --> 00:25:07.414]  And here's what I'm getting at.
[00:25:07.414 --> 00:25:13.018]  Just like when the month before they went after the electors, they were going after him covertly.
[00:25:13.018 --> 00:25:16.280]  We were exposing it and they would say, oh, you're a conspiracy terrorist.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.102]  No one's going after the electors.
[00:25:18.102 --> 00:25:21.484]  They don't want any opposition to mount to their ongoing programs.
[00:25:21.484 --> 00:25:24.026]  So what I'm saying is they're currently with seven days left.
[00:25:25.369 --> 00:25:36.516]  Seriously trying, not just the moron left, but the deep state, to sell the public on the suspension of the election, a national emergency, and basically martial law.
[00:25:36.516 --> 00:25:43.681]  And that's why you hear Rosie O'Donnell saying this, because these talking points are being discussed by the leftists in newspapers.
[00:25:43.681 --> 00:25:51.366]  I mean, they're in the New York Times, they're in the Washington Post, calling for impeachment to begin right away, calling for a suspension of this election.
[00:25:51.766 --> 00:25:54.008]  They're already calling for it.
[00:25:54.008 --> 00:25:55.350]  It's so unconstitutional.
[00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.171]  It's so naked.
[00:25:56.171 --> 00:25:57.492]  It's so brazen.
[00:25:57.492 --> 00:26:05.181]  We are having trouble believing they're even doing this, but I'm trying to assure everyone they are currently moving and are currently trying this because, look,
[00:26:06.505 --> 00:26:10.306]  Even Bernie Sanders has had to come out and say, OK, Trump's right on trade.
[00:26:10.306 --> 00:26:12.787]  OK, Trump's right on bringing the tax money back.
[00:26:12.787 --> 00:26:14.688]  OK, Trump really is bringing jobs back.
[00:26:14.688 --> 00:26:17.749]  Because his own constituents are turning against Sanders.
[00:26:17.749 --> 00:26:21.550]  Sanders is a slime ball, but he understands which way the wind is blowing.
[00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.411]  He understands real prosperity is here.
[00:26:24.986 --> 00:26:29.668]  Trump is turning off all the globalist policies that have made this country a rust bucket.
[00:26:29.668 --> 00:26:31.389]  The globalists are in full panic.
[00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:35.211]  Trump intends, folks, to completely deliver.
[00:26:35.211 --> 00:26:39.873]  Then it'll just be up to us to be moral and hardworking and save money and be good people.
[00:26:39.873 --> 00:26:44.455]  But this country and the world, America doing well will make the rest of the world do well.
[00:26:44.455 --> 00:26:45.736]  It's not a zero-sum game.
[00:26:45.736 --> 00:26:49.438]  It's a non-zero-sum game, or a 361, as we talk about.
[00:26:49.438 --> 00:26:51.739]  And Trump understands that the engine of liberty
[00:26:52.239 --> 00:26:57.925]  The engine of Renaissance will empower the entire world for anybody that wants to work hard and be moral.
[00:26:57.925 --> 00:27:02.089]  So they are in complete and total panic mode.
[00:27:02.089 --> 00:27:07.375]  And as you said, David, they are activating the sorrow cells to disrupt and block.
[00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:09.177]  It's being literally led.
[00:27:10.268 --> 00:27:27.616]  A former head of the Weathermen Underground that was connected to bombing and blowing the eyeballs out of police officers, you name it, and who openly, openly, in those meetings that came out in the FBI files and court hearings, was planning to put 50 million Americans in re-education camps and kill 25 million of us.
[00:27:27.616 --> 00:27:29.017]  We ought to pull up Larry Grafwald.
[00:27:30.178 --> 00:27:31.119]  We're good to go.
[00:27:47.034 --> 00:27:48.575]  But what a pain or what a degree.
[00:28:17.714 --> 00:28:18.315]  You can come here.
[00:28:18.315 --> 00:28:19.755]  You've got diseases, you can come here.
[00:28:19.755 --> 00:28:21.576]  You've got no documentation, you can come here.
[00:28:21.576 --> 00:28:23.036]  You want to come here and have a baby for free?
[00:28:23.036 --> 00:28:23.797]  You can come here.
[00:28:23.797 --> 00:28:36.861]  But you're a bunch of Cubans fleeing 50-something years of absolute total tyranny and hundreds of thousands murdered and millions in prison, and you come here and you're active, you're pro-gun, you're pro-America, you're pro-freedom.
[00:28:36.861 --> 00:28:38.822]  I can't tell you how many times it's Cuban-Americans
[00:28:39.282 --> 00:28:40.083]  Fighting tyranny.
[00:28:40.083 --> 00:28:42.547]  10 to 1 what other Americans are doing.
[00:28:42.547 --> 00:28:43.869]  And the globalists are in panic mode.
[00:28:43.869 --> 00:28:46.072]  They're like, no more of these Cubans.
[00:28:46.072 --> 00:28:47.233]  You keep them out.
[00:28:47.233 --> 00:28:50.137]  It shows the complete evil agenda of these people, David.
[00:28:50.973 --> 00:29:00.436]  Yeah, you know Alex, we were talking about the Electoral College, and of course we saw that happen with the nomination, we saw it with the election, and they say, hey, we're going to get people to overthrow the votes of the voters in the various states.
[00:29:00.436 --> 00:29:11.079]  But also remember that it was Evan McMullin, former CIA guy, that Glenn Beck and others pushed in Utah to try to block Trump from getting an electoral majority.
[00:29:11.079 --> 00:29:13.440]  They thought that would be a very effective strategy.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.901]  They didn't realize just how far out he was.
[00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:17.181]  But of course, this is a guy who went
[00:29:17.541 --> 00:29:21.191]  To meet with ISIS, went with John McCain to meet with ISIS.
[00:29:21.191 --> 00:29:23.798]  Evan McMullin, this is the guy they picked, a CIA operative.
[00:29:24.568 --> 00:29:26.109]  Exactly, David, that's why you're so great.
[00:29:26.109 --> 00:29:28.451]  You'll bring up all the backstory, all the background.
[00:29:28.451 --> 00:29:36.137]  This whole thing, our rogue, criminal, multinational corporate agents that have infiltrated the CIA, the NSA.
[00:29:36.137 --> 00:29:41.200]  These bodies were set up, especially the CIA, to bring America into globalism.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.504]  It was set up from the beginning, out of the whole Rhodes Scholarship.
[00:29:45.504 --> 00:29:47.145]  It was all a Cecil Rhodes plan.
[00:29:47.145 --> 00:29:48.466]  He wrote multiple books on it.
[00:29:48.846 --> 00:29:52.609]  They set up the Pratt House in New York in 1921 to do it.
[00:29:52.609 --> 00:29:55.971]  The CFR, that's the World Commission on International Affairs.
[00:30:00.703 --> 00:30:02.444]  Here's Donald Trump on Twitter today.
[00:30:02.444 --> 00:30:03.284]  He also tweeted, Amen.
[00:30:03.284 --> 00:30:04.684]  Now, here is Rosie O'Donnell on Twitter.
[00:30:26.171 --> 00:30:33.636]  I fully support imposing martial law, delaying the inauguration, until Trump is cleared of all charges.
[00:30:33.636 --> 00:30:36.358]  All her hearsay mafia minion followers agreed.
[00:30:36.358 --> 00:30:40.441]  The only problem with that is, there are no charges to be cleared!
[00:30:40.441 --> 00:30:42.502]  Just fake news allegations that you fall for.
[00:30:42.842 --> 00:30:44.784]  Remember her side of the fence before the election?
[00:30:44.784 --> 00:30:46.346]  When they go low, we go high.
[00:30:46.346 --> 00:30:48.528]  Trump and Republicans need to accept the results.
[00:30:48.528 --> 00:30:49.449]  So much for that.
[00:30:49.449 --> 00:30:50.811]  Two things were confirmed today.
[00:30:50.811 --> 00:30:52.152]  Trump on Twitter is awesome.
[00:30:52.152 --> 00:30:55.155]  And Rosie O'Donnell is a hypocritical wine bag moron.
[00:30:55.155 --> 00:30:56.496]  Jabba the Hutt in the flesh.
[00:30:56.496 --> 00:30:58.298]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com

[00:32:54.443 --> 00:32:59.527]  InfoWars has come a long way and InfoWars Prime is just one more weapon in the fight for liberty.
[00:33:10.142 --> 00:33:18.648]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:21.776 --> 00:33:24.998]  Alright, Alex Jones here from the road about to hand the baton to David Knight.
[00:33:24.998 --> 00:33:27.379]  And David's doing such a great job trying to get a word in.
[00:33:27.379 --> 00:33:34.222]  Ed Schweizer will have now a couple hours to break all this down and lay this out for you and hopefully later also open the phones up and take your calls.
[00:33:34.222 --> 00:33:45.687]  But as he was just getting into, we have the CIA, former field commander up in Utah, starting this whole elector deal and trying to get electors to turn against
[00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:55.031]  Trump, this started basically the day after the election on November 9th.
[00:33:55.031 --> 00:34:01.872]  Before that, he was trying to get Utahns to vote for him so they could broker a deal and basically still defeat Trump.
[00:34:01.872 --> 00:34:10.174]  And this guy admittedly works for McCain, as David Knight just said, went over and met with ISIS, met with al-Nusra, met with al-Qaeda.
[00:34:10.174 --> 00:34:13.755]  These are truly monstrous, monstrous individuals.
[00:34:13.755 --> 00:34:15.375]  But guess what we did?
[00:34:15.375 --> 00:34:15.915]  We came out.
[00:34:16.707 --> 00:34:19.528]  Before the election and after it and said, this guy's a scumbag.
[00:34:19.528 --> 00:34:22.690]  And again, I don't want to sit here and just say it's all CIA.
[00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:24.831]  I'm not defending the CIA either.
[00:34:24.831 --> 00:34:40.058]  It's criminals, it's globalists, it's corrupt individuals, it's operatives of this system that wants to basically enslave everybody that are inside and in control of these institutions that are above the law.
[00:34:40.058 --> 00:34:45.021]  The CIA, according to its charter, under the National Security Act of 1947, is basically above the law.
[00:34:45.891 --> 00:34:47.813]  And invisible.
[00:34:47.813 --> 00:34:50.074]  It's worse than the UN with its diplomatic immunity.
[00:34:50.074 --> 00:34:51.795]  I mean, it has license to kill.
[00:34:51.795 --> 00:34:53.076]  It's out of control.
[00:34:53.076 --> 00:34:57.239]  It's a perfect system for a takeover of the country.
[00:34:57.239 --> 00:35:06.026]  The group claiming they're protecting the country are really the ones using the country to dominate and take over the world at our expense.
[00:35:06.026 --> 00:35:07.827]  That's about to come to an end.
[00:35:07.827 --> 00:35:09.628]  They have mismanaged things.
[00:35:09.628 --> 00:35:12.731]  Even from a Machiavellian perspective, they have not delivered.
[00:35:14.023 --> 00:35:17.906]  Even on their promise to their own controllers, they have destabilized the world.
[00:35:17.906 --> 00:35:28.973]  They have created a more evil world, a more unstable world, and so they're being rejected, and Americanism, not globalism, is returning, and the New World Order is panicking.
[00:35:28.973 --> 00:35:36.357]  So, I want to play this Grathwald clip, an FBI informant, from his meetings inside the Weather Underground with Bill Ayers.
[00:35:36.357 --> 00:35:40.200]  This issue was just given hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:50.143]  By the big foundations and the big Fortune 100, and George Soros gave over $100 million right after the election to these groups, but hundreds of millions more.
[00:35:50.143 --> 00:35:52.423]  I mean, the numbers, it's just unknown.
[00:35:52.423 --> 00:35:54.424]  It's billions the last few years.
[00:35:54.424 --> 00:35:59.245]  But since the election just a few months ago, massive funding of this individual.
[00:36:01.901 --> 00:36:06.506]  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government.
[00:36:06.506 --> 00:36:15.295]  You know, we become responsible then for administrating, you know, 250 million people.
[00:36:15.295 --> 00:36:16.296]  And there was no answers.
[00:36:17.581 --> 00:36:20.803]  No one had given any thought to economics.
[00:36:20.803 --> 00:36:23.945]  How are you going to clothe and feed these people?
[00:36:23.945 --> 00:36:35.493]  The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans and the North Vietnamese and the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United States.
[00:36:35.493 --> 00:36:40.977]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution.
[00:36:42.575 --> 00:36:54.978]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[00:36:54.978 --> 00:37:01.280]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them.
[00:37:02.777 --> 00:37:05.018]  How things were going to be.
[00:37:05.018 --> 00:37:08.620]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:12.462]  That are die-hard capitalists.
[00:37:12.462 --> 00:37:16.524]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[00:37:16.524 --> 00:37:24.949]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[00:37:24.949 --> 00:37:26.650]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[00:37:28.265 --> 00:37:29.826]  25 million people.
[00:37:29.826 --> 00:37:51.500]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers, and hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.221]  And they were dead serious.
[00:37:54.724 --> 00:37:59.268]  Now, people ask why I get upset on air, and it's because I've got hundreds of points I want to make.
[00:37:59.268 --> 00:38:09.156]  I'm teleprompter-free, and I'm just so upset and frustrated because I know we're up against people just like Larry Graffald, who just died a few years ago, was breaking down.
[00:38:09.156 --> 00:38:11.258]  By the way, I interviewed him several times over the years.
[00:38:11.258 --> 00:38:13.239]  I didn't know how sick he was right before he died.
[00:38:13.239 --> 00:38:14.340]  I interviewed him.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:19.885]  We should probably dig that interview up, and I think after Trump gets inaugurated and gets in, we should probably take
[00:38:20.585 --> 00:38:40.221]  Some of the folks that aren't here with us anymore and posthumously give them awards for their fight against the globalists and maybe even give some cash rewards to their family just because we need to recognize the real patriots and have our own award ceremonies not to ourselves but to those that have paid the ultimate price and fought so hard.
[00:38:40.221 --> 00:38:46.086]  That's why it's disgusting to see Biden being awarded Medal of Freedom and a surprise ceremony brimming with emotion.
[00:38:46.086 --> 00:38:47.848]  Obama presents VP of the nation's top
[00:38:49.065 --> 00:38:50.567]  Civilian honor.
[00:38:50.567 --> 00:38:56.752]  I mean, they admit everything they're doing is to sabotage this country for the globalists, to sell us off to the Communist Chinese.
[00:38:56.752 --> 00:38:58.794]  They gave the $14 to $20 million.
[00:39:00.556 --> 00:39:06.460]  Identities, an entire system to roll up the entire US spy network and all of their assets.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.660]  They blew us wide open.
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.041]  They brought us down.
[00:39:09.041 --> 00:39:10.462]  They sold us out.
[00:39:10.462 --> 00:39:15.305]  That's another reason you're seeing this whole struggle right now is because they've just gone so far.
[00:39:15.305 --> 00:39:28.253]  They've opened the borders for three years and let people in that they know have syphilis, drug-resistant TB, and yes, even things like flesh-eating bacteria and, of course, leprosy.
[00:39:29.128 --> 00:39:37.551]  I would tell people about leprosy three years ago because I have health department sources in Florida, Texas and California and they would say, oh you're crazy there's no leprosy.
[00:39:37.551 --> 00:39:39.431]  Well now it's in the Associated Press.
[00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:53.876]  They put kids with leprosy in schools in Texas and in California in liberal areas and then let it spread and then use it as a test case with the health departments through DHS to see if they can cover it up.
[00:39:55.050 --> 00:40:02.553]  Just like they used Ebola cases all over the United States, and they were all over the United States, and it even came out here and there as a cover-up drill.
[00:40:02.553 --> 00:40:11.957]  All of this is testing what they can get away with, and a criminal, globalist, multinational cabal is in control of the CIA.
[00:40:11.957 --> 00:40:18.740]  The robber barons set up the UN to transfer our power to it and other multinational groups like TPP and the WTO.
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.661]  We're now awakening to that and saying no.
[00:40:21.787 --> 00:40:33.951]  And so now, they are openly, just like they did with the electors and the recount, nobody believed me until it started happening, they're now priming the pump for civil emergency in the next seven days with huge riots kicking off.
[00:40:33.951 --> 00:40:35.931]  I'm not saying this is going to happen.
[00:40:35.931 --> 00:40:41.693]  I'm saying they're planning it, they admit it, they have been prepping it, they're saying that the election should be suspended.
[00:40:41.693 --> 00:40:46.134]  And so, I'm going to ask David this as I leave, okay?
[00:40:46.134 --> 00:40:47.835]  I want him to think and write some notes here.
[00:40:49.483 --> 00:40:53.325]  David, and I want to ask Snyder, coming up, I want to ask you the listeners, I want to create a debate around this.
[00:40:53.325 --> 00:41:00.470]  What do we do with seven days out, here on Friday the 13th, to focus attention on this and to expose it?
[00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:05.893]  I think we tweeted Trump, we write articles, we put out videos.
[00:41:05.893 --> 00:41:15.439]  We tell Trump, hey, you've done a great job, we think you need to come out and point out that Hillary was bought off by the Chinese and the Saudi Arabians, and that's why you changed the subject onto Russia.
[00:41:16.548 --> 00:41:19.029]  You're going to be investigating Hillary, which is now being announced.
[00:41:19.029 --> 00:41:20.470]  Take the gloves off.
[00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.410]  They knew Trump was always going after Hillary.
[00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:23.531]  He was always going to drain the swamp.
[00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:25.392]  He was always going to lock her up.
[00:41:25.392 --> 00:41:27.332]  But he had to play possum.
[00:41:27.332 --> 00:41:29.073]  They now know it was always possum.
[00:41:29.073 --> 00:41:30.714]  So this is a death battle, folks.
[00:41:30.714 --> 00:41:31.694]  This is an epic time.
[00:41:31.694 --> 00:41:32.515]  Call in the C-SPAN.
[00:41:32.515 --> 00:41:35.116]  Call in other talk shows.
[00:41:35.116 --> 00:41:36.296]  Get all over the internet.
[00:41:36.296 --> 00:41:37.176]  Comment everywhere.
[00:41:37.176 --> 00:41:39.437]  Do banner hangs on highways.
[00:41:39.437 --> 00:41:40.598]  Whatever is legal and lawful.
[00:41:41.379 --> 00:41:42.400]  Come to D.C.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:48.489]  to stand up against these communists in a peaceful way and totally outnumber them like we did in Cleveland so they shrunk back in their holes.
[00:41:49.412 --> 00:41:52.454]  Now, in closing, I'm going to hand the baton to David Knight.
[00:41:52.454 --> 00:41:56.856]  I get so focused on finding the globalists, I don't even plug our products or what we do here.
[00:41:56.856 --> 00:42:11.745]  Whether it's anti-globalist t-shirts, or Molon Labe t-shirts, whether it's non-GMO heirloom seeds, or whether it's the supplements, we're just extending sales of whatever's still in stock and whatever's come back in, like selenium was sold out, bio-tree selenium, truly amazing, that's back.
[00:42:11.745 --> 00:42:15.647]  DNA Force is back, that is 10% off, that has been sold out for two months.
[00:42:16.527 --> 00:42:20.689]  We have, what, 30% off on a whole bunch of the products.
[00:42:20.689 --> 00:42:23.010]  Brain Force, our amazing nootropic.
[00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.492]  More Super Mel Vitality came in, but a limited amount.
[00:42:25.492 --> 00:42:27.372]  It'll be a month until more comes in.
[00:42:27.372 --> 00:42:29.614]  That's about to sell out.
[00:42:29.614 --> 00:42:32.255]  But we've got a whole bunch of stuff discounted.
[00:42:32.255 --> 00:42:36.397]  Later, David can list it all, but it's at m4warsstore.com, or m4warslive.com.
[00:42:37.526 --> 00:42:55.123]  But whatever you do, support the broadcast, spread the link, spread the videos, but also, these are great products, whether it's Prostagard, or whether it's our super high quality Mediterranean Organic Oil of Oregano Caplets, that are 100% pure, you know, absorbed right into your body, the very best out there.
[00:42:55.123 --> 00:43:01.870]  Whether it's the Sleep Aid Knockout, whether it's the Lung Cleanse, whether it's the Liver Shield, whether it's the Natural Defense Parasite Cleanse,
[00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:09.176]  It's all available at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:43:09.176 --> 00:43:10.838]  We have almost 30 products now.
[00:43:10.838 --> 00:43:13.340]  Longevity is another great company I work with.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:14.701]  They have over 400 products.
[00:43:14.701 --> 00:43:21.688]  InfoWarsTeam.com when you get Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0 or Polymers or the Osseo FX products.
[00:43:22.328 --> 00:43:25.890]  When you sign up for AutoShip, you get free shipping.
[00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:28.631]  When you sign up to be a distributor, you get big discounts.
[00:43:28.631 --> 00:43:35.415]  And a small part of the money that they make goes to fund our operation, about 5, 6, 7 percent, depending on what you purchase.
[00:43:35.415 --> 00:43:37.096]  And that helps fund the operation.
[00:43:37.096 --> 00:43:43.639]  So if you love Young Jeopardy products like I do, InfoWarsTeam.com as well is the key site for that.
[00:43:43.639 --> 00:43:50.323]  But this is just... I keep saying historical time, and everybody overuses the word, you know, epic.
[00:43:51.132 --> 00:43:53.654]  People overuse the word saying it's like Hitler.
[00:43:53.654 --> 00:43:59.579]  Well, Trump finally came out and said the media and the agencies are acting like Hitler.
[00:43:59.579 --> 00:44:03.882]  Yeah, Hitler overthrew governments, Hitler did corrupt things, Hitler lied about people.
[00:44:03.882 --> 00:44:10.588]  This is very Hitlerian, all the surveillance, all the tyranny, all the corruption, all the spies, all the manipulations.
[00:44:10.588 --> 00:44:12.069]  It's very authoritarian.
[00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:19.495]  And David, you made a really good central point yesterday, and I'm going to hand the baton to you and just ask you what else we can do, but you were making the point that you hope Trump
[00:44:20.729 --> 00:44:26.814]  He's learning about the surveillance state, because the one area he's been bad at, and it's his heart, and he means well, he's very smart, he's a good guy.
[00:44:26.814 --> 00:44:29.737]  He believes, well, if the government's good, then the surveillance is okay.
[00:44:29.737 --> 00:44:30.338]  No.
[00:44:30.338 --> 00:44:32.459]  It's always used against innocent people.
[00:44:32.459 --> 00:44:34.081]  It's a Pandora's box.
[00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:37.023]  We need to get back to the Constitution and Bill of Rights for a reason.
[00:44:37.023 --> 00:44:40.747]  We need to get back to not, as you said, Obama, as he leaves, he's changing laws.
[00:44:41.287 --> 00:44:42.027]  We're good to go.
[00:45:11.096 --> 00:45:13.338]  Thank you, Alex, and that truly is my hope.
[00:45:13.338 --> 00:45:16.460]  And Donald Trump is a smart guy.
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:21.383]  And unlike these other people, he's not controlled by these cabals.
[00:45:21.383 --> 00:45:22.283]  He's his own man.
[00:45:22.283 --> 00:45:27.407]  And so I truly believe that if, as he sees these types of things happening to him,
[00:45:28.294 --> 00:45:31.437]  And as he hears other people, he can change his mind on issues.
[00:45:31.437 --> 00:45:32.858]  I mean, he is open to things like that.
[00:45:32.858 --> 00:45:37.642]  That's why we see the situation that we saw with RFK Jr.
[00:45:37.642 --> 00:45:45.528]  crossing the lines of party lines and saying, hey, I'll work with Donald Trump against the CDC's abuses.
[00:45:45.528 --> 00:45:52.134]  And of course, we just have this article today about Allison Young, USA Today, pointing out how the CDC is keeping secret
[00:45:52.674 --> 00:45:54.715]  All of its mishaps with deadly germs.
[00:45:54.715 --> 00:45:56.396]  So it's not just vaccines, it's these other things.
[00:45:56.396 --> 00:46:01.839]  We have these quasi-governmental organizations like the Federal Reserve, like the CDC.
[00:46:01.839 --> 00:46:02.760]  They need to be audited.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.561]  CDC needs to be audited as well.
[00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:06.362]  But when we see people like RFK Jr.
[00:46:06.362 --> 00:46:11.565]  come across, and we got the article up on Infowars.com, Bernie Sanders say, hey, I agree with Donald Trump.
[00:46:11.565 --> 00:46:14.147]  I'd like to change the infrastructure as long as we make sure that we don't...
[00:46:14.887 --> 00:46:19.249]  Give it all away to private companies, as long as we don't privatize the infrastructure.
[00:46:19.249 --> 00:46:22.010]  I'd like to work with them on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, too.
[00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:28.053]  So, we have people that we have profound disagreements with, like RFK Jr.
[00:46:28.053 --> 00:46:30.034]  and Bernie Sanders on many issues.
[00:46:30.034 --> 00:46:30.954]  We have profound agreements.
[00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:37.837]  But I think the key thing that Donald Trump can do, and we've already seen him do this, and we can see it, I think, to some extent in the confirmation hearings,
[00:46:38.297 --> 00:46:41.621]  Is that he doesn't have unilateral agreement with everybody on everything.
[00:46:41.621 --> 00:46:46.527]  He doesn't demand that people come in and agree with him on everything and be yes men.
[00:46:46.527 --> 00:46:53.675]  And so I think it's important that we look at these confirmation hearings and we see what people are saying and we understand also that he's going to remain in charge.
[00:46:53.675 --> 00:46:54.396]  At least that's what we hope.
[00:46:54.696 --> 00:46:56.477]  We hope that it doesn't turn around the other way.
[00:46:56.477 --> 00:47:01.020]  That's why we're concerned when we see certain people that are in the cabinet that say, well, we're going in this way.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:03.501]  And Donald Trump has been saying, no, I'm going in the other way.
[00:47:03.501 --> 00:47:07.003]  We always hope that the, you know, we're going to wait and see which way the influence goes.
[00:47:07.003 --> 00:47:08.104]  But I think he's a strong leader.
[00:47:08.104 --> 00:47:11.906]  I think he will do the right thing if these people go in a different direction.
[00:47:11.906 --> 00:47:20.511]  And before I get to some of this other news, I've got to say one of the things that Alex mentioned about Joe Biden getting the Medal of Freedom and crying about it.
[00:47:20.511 --> 00:47:22.752]  That's something that really bothered me to see that.
[00:47:23.559 --> 00:47:27.543]  Not the fact that he's crying, not the fact that he's getting sentimental about his son's death.
[00:47:27.543 --> 00:47:30.706]  I think that had a lot to do with it, because that was mentioned by Obama.
[00:47:30.706 --> 00:47:38.453]  But look, my remembrance of Joe Biden is before he got the hair transplants, before he became Vice President.
[00:47:38.453 --> 00:47:40.374]  I remember the Clarence Thomas hearings.
[00:47:40.374 --> 00:47:44.138]  The same type of stuff that we're seeing now going on with the Cabinet.
[00:47:44.138 --> 00:47:46.180]  My wife and I were on vacation at the time.
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.703]  We were listening to them in the radio as they were being broadcast live.
[00:47:50.353 --> 00:48:02.023]  And I remember Joe Biden railing against Clarence Thomas because Clarence Thomas had supported the concept of natural rights, and by extension, natural law.
[00:48:02.023 --> 00:48:04.304]  In other words, our rights come from God.
[00:48:04.304 --> 00:48:05.926]  They're not granted by government.
[00:48:05.926 --> 00:48:11.170]  Government is there to protect the rights that we have inherently as human beings.
[00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:13.412]  That's the Declaration of Independence.
[00:48:13.412 --> 00:48:19.677]  And I could not believe that Joe Biden was absolutely incensed by the fact that Clarence Thomas would support that.
[00:48:20.057 --> 00:48:33.764]  He felt that Clarence Thomas, supporting the principles embodied in the Declaration of Independence by Jefferson and the signers, he thought that those fundamental American principles of natural rights and natural law were disqualifying for Clarence Thomas.
[00:48:33.764 --> 00:48:34.544]  Can you believe that?
[00:48:35.503 --> 00:48:38.566]  I mean, go back and take a look at what he said in those hearings.
[00:48:38.566 --> 00:48:39.888]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:48:39.888 --> 00:48:44.813]  And here's the guy that Barack Obama gives a Presidential Medal of Freedom.
[00:48:44.813 --> 00:48:45.994]  He doesn't support freedom.
[00:48:45.994 --> 00:48:47.756]  He doesn't support individual rights.
[00:48:47.756 --> 00:48:50.939]  He doesn't support liberty in any way, shape, or form.
[00:48:50.939 --> 00:48:53.161]  Now, later in the program, we're going to be talking to Craig Richardson.
[00:48:53.161 --> 00:48:55.684]  He's the President of Energy and Environment Legal.
[00:48:57.586 --> 00:49:04.874]  We see this explosion of regulations that are coming from Obama, especially in the last days, especially through the EPA.
[00:49:04.874 --> 00:49:11.501]  The EPA, it doesn't say, for the last two days, the EPA has gone after yet another major car company.
[00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:15.906]  We had three days ago, they arrested a VW executive.
[00:49:16.764 --> 00:49:16.924]  And I
[00:49:33.138 --> 00:49:34.359]  Do you see a pattern here?
[00:49:34.359 --> 00:49:42.365]  They want to shut down diesel engines, they want to shut down internal combustion engines, and that's a globalist tactic, just like the way they're coming after coal.
[00:49:42.365 --> 00:49:57.217]  So we're going to talk to Craig Richardson about that, and of course in the next hour we're going to be joined by Michael Snyder, a frequent contributor to Infowars.com, about the anarchists that are hoping to turn Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20th into one of the biggest riots in U.S.
[00:49:57.217 --> 00:49:57.497]  history.
[00:49:57.497 --> 00:49:58.458]  That's his article.
[00:49:58.458 --> 00:50:01.200]  Also asking, why is Obama moving troops into Poland?
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.781]  And provoking a war with Russia right before the inauguration.
[00:50:04.781 --> 00:50:09.582]  So he's doing a lot of things, and he's hoping that Donald Trump will not be able to turn these back.
[00:50:09.582 --> 00:50:21.286]  He's hoping that they can do these things, put them in in terms of provocative Cold War actions, and that he can tie Donald Trump's hands by saying, you are a Russian agent.
[00:50:21.286 --> 00:50:24.527]  So they're doing everything that they can to make that come true.
[00:50:25.487 --> 00:50:30.712]  Today we've got the Washington Post saying some people are calling Donald Trump a Manchurian candidate.
[00:50:30.712 --> 00:50:32.233]  Notice how cleverly they do that?
[00:50:32.233 --> 00:50:34.315]  They don't say, we think he's a Manchurian candidate.
[00:50:34.315 --> 00:50:37.298]  They imply that he's a Manchurian candidate.
[00:50:37.298 --> 00:50:38.459]  And we come back from the break.
[00:50:38.459 --> 00:50:42.603]  I'm going to tell you who the real Manchurian candidate was and is.
[00:50:42.603 --> 00:50:42.864]  Okay?
[00:50:42.864 --> 00:50:44.926]  It's not Donald Trump.
[00:50:44.926 --> 00:50:46.547]  Yeah, you guessed it.
[00:50:46.547 --> 00:50:47.768]  His name starts with a no.
[00:50:47.768 --> 00:50:48.369]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:00.639 --> 00:51:02.521]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[00:51:02.521 --> 00:51:05.764]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.

[00:51:07.346 --> 00:51:10.209]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:51:10.209 --> 00:51:10.870]  Awesome.

[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:23.761]  Life-saving, ready to eat bacon.
[00:51:23.761 --> 00:51:25.703]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[00:51:31.403 --> 00:51:33.023]  What's it going to take?
[00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:34.484]  Another news story?

[00:51:40.545 --> 00:51:42.066]  Things aren't getting better.
[00:51:42.066 --> 00:51:43.426]  They're getting worse.
[00:51:43.426 --> 00:51:46.047]  Thousands already wear Infidel Body Armor.

[00:52:18.613 --> 00:52:24.800]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:31.028]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[00:52:31.028 --> 00:52:33.611]  Revelation, dawn of global government.

[00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:09.691]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:09.691 --> 00:54:10.851]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[00:54:10.851 --> 00:54:14.053]  I want to go back and talk about the real Manchurian candidate.
[00:54:14.053 --> 00:54:21.698]  Washington Post is implying that Trump is, very strongly implying, and they say, let us tell you what this metaphor is about.
[00:54:21.698 --> 00:54:26.721]  And so we're going to talk about that article, you know, because you have all these different movies that have come up that have become metaphors.
[00:54:26.721 --> 00:54:30.203]  Movies like Gaslight, we're talking about Gaslighting, or Kitsch 22.
[00:54:30.203 --> 00:54:33.204]  And they say, well, Manchurian candidate, you know, that's a metaphor as well.
[00:54:33.204 --> 00:54:34.145]  Let's explain that.
[00:54:35.356 --> 00:54:40.947]  Not directly attacking Trump, but in a very passive, aggressive way, is what the Washington Post is doing.
[00:54:40.947 --> 00:54:43.471]  The same way that CNN came after him earlier this week.
[00:54:43.471 --> 00:54:45.415]  So we're going to talk about that in just a moment, real quickly.
[00:54:46.391 --> 00:54:48.312]  Alex is talking about the specials that we have.
[00:54:48.312 --> 00:54:52.315]  It's very important at the beginning of the year, I think, to establish new habits.
[00:54:52.315 --> 00:54:53.876]  It's one of the ways that we can improve our lives.
[00:54:53.876 --> 00:54:56.938]  Everybody's looking to try to make themselves healthier as the new year begins.
[00:54:56.938 --> 00:54:58.899]  One of the ways you do that is by establishing habits.
[00:54:58.899 --> 00:55:12.548]  You know, one of the things I've noticed when I had a little bit more time than usual, I would kind of see a dip in my energy level over the weekends because over the weekends I wasn't taking the supplements from InfoWars I typically take.
[00:55:13.095 --> 00:55:16.377]  Things like Supermail Vitality or Survival Shield X2 and Ace of Nine-Nine.
[00:55:16.377 --> 00:55:20.138]  I have a routine, a habit, that I do that on weekdays.
[00:55:20.138 --> 00:55:25.301]  And I would get involved with other things I didn't have that habit on weekends, and I could notice a difference.
[00:55:25.301 --> 00:55:30.143]  I don't notice a difference on most of the things when I take them right away, except for things like brain force.
[00:55:30.143 --> 00:55:33.965]  That focuses my thoughts, so I definitely notice it with that, but the other ones...
[00:55:34.665 --> 00:55:40.750]  I didn't notice it until a couple of days went by without taking them and then I could really notice a difference.
[00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:42.512]  So you need to set up your habit.
[00:55:42.512 --> 00:55:46.415]  You need to get yourself on auto ship because we do have products that go out of stock occasionally.
[00:55:46.415 --> 00:55:50.978]  We just had DNA Force go out of stock for over a month.
[00:55:50.978 --> 00:55:58.425]  We've gotten that back in an emergency limited supply and we have offered it as 10% off to help you stock back up.
[00:55:59.341 --> 00:55:59.902]  All the time.
[00:55:59.902 --> 00:56:03.965]  We offer 10% off if you set up auto-ship.
[00:56:03.965 --> 00:56:08.969]  And if your orders total more than $50 or more, then you get free shipping when you set up auto-ship.
[00:56:08.969 --> 00:56:11.111]  But right now, we also have some specials.
[00:56:11.111 --> 00:56:13.273]  30% off Brain Force, I just mentioned.
[00:56:13.273 --> 00:56:16.095]  30% off Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine, I just mentioned.
[00:56:16.095 --> 00:56:17.436]  Also, Supermail Vitality, 30% off.
[00:56:18.953 --> 00:56:20.734]  We have 20% off Secret 12.
[00:56:20.734 --> 00:56:23.095]  That's our vitamin B12 liquid formulation.
[00:56:23.095 --> 00:56:24.796]  20% off of that.
[00:56:24.796 --> 00:56:29.098]  20% off Liver Shield and Knockout, which is our natural sleep aid.
[00:56:29.098 --> 00:56:33.920]  Prostagard 20% off and many others at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.061]  We appreciate your support.
[00:56:35.061 --> 00:56:36.561]  That is the way we fund our operation.
[00:56:36.561 --> 00:56:40.683]  Media Matters and others are funded by the government, by George Soros and so forth.
[00:56:40.683 --> 00:56:45.906]  And we're going to be talking to Michael Snyder in the next segment about the people behind this effort.
[00:56:46.366 --> 00:56:50.147]  To try to create riots, to try to establish martial law.
[00:56:50.147 --> 00:56:55.369]  That's been a tactic of terrorists for a long time, to try to provoke an overstep of the government.
[00:56:55.369 --> 00:56:57.009]  But of course she's calling for martial law.
[00:56:57.009 --> 00:57:01.411]  I was really kind of surprised that Rosie O'Donnell could even spell it the right way.
[00:57:01.411 --> 00:57:07.292]  Maybe she doesn't really realize, let's be charitable and say she doesn't really realize what she's truly calling for.
[00:57:07.292 --> 00:57:10.093]  Because that is truly a serious thing to call for that.
[00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:15.195]  But let's go back to this Manchurian candidate, this slander that Washington Post is putting out there.
[00:57:15.535 --> 00:57:18.218]  They're saying, well, you know, a lot of people have said this.
[00:57:18.218 --> 00:57:20.320]  Max Boot said it in the New York Times.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:25.364]  Max Boot, the perennial never-Trumper, another partisan hack.
[00:57:25.364 --> 00:57:27.066]  That's where these things are always coming from.
[00:57:27.066 --> 00:57:32.711]  You know, they've called Donald Trump Hitler so many times, it's become a meme.
[00:57:32.711 --> 00:57:38.417]  Everybody from Glenn Beck to these people, the Washington Post, calling him Hitler.
[00:57:38.417 --> 00:57:40.519]  And you notice the other day how indignant they got.
[00:57:41.087 --> 00:57:51.511]  They even had the Anne Frank Museum call out Donald Trump, saying, you said these people were acting like Nazis, creating fake information and putting it out there to assassinate your character.
[00:57:51.511 --> 00:57:54.932]  You know, he said, that's the type of thing that Nazis did and have done.
[00:57:55.936 --> 00:58:00.661]  And I said, you can't invoke the Nazis because then that minimizes the Holocaust.
[00:58:00.661 --> 00:58:02.342]  That's what the Anne Frank people said.
[00:58:02.342 --> 00:58:05.866]  But it was okay when they did it ad nauseum.
[00:58:05.866 --> 00:58:06.746]  Over and over again.
[00:58:06.746 --> 00:58:09.009]  Ad infinitum, okay?
[00:58:09.009 --> 00:58:09.829]  Against Donald Trump.
[00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:11.932]  Now they've got a new one because that's getting old.
[00:58:11.932 --> 00:58:13.133]  The Manchurian candidate.
[00:58:13.573 --> 00:58:17.154]  You know, the real Manchurian candidate is the guy who had multiple names.
[00:58:17.154 --> 00:58:19.775]  The guy who did everything he could to seal his record.
[00:58:19.775 --> 00:58:23.636]  The guy who traveled to Pakistan for a while and returned with a new Muslim name.
[00:58:23.636 --> 00:58:26.677]  The guy who grew up and was schooled in Islamic Indonesia.
[00:58:26.677 --> 00:58:32.838]  The guy who tried to cover up Christian symbols as one of the first speeches that he had when he was inaugurated.
[00:58:32.838 --> 00:58:36.279]  The guy who, when you saw his birth certificate, you saw it was a forgery.
[00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:38.400]  That Manchurian candidate, Barack Obama.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:41.000]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.681]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.514 --> 00:58:46.678]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:50.194 --> 00:58:56.737]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:58:56.737 --> 00:58:59.978]  Dr. Group, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:58:59.978 --> 00:59:05.560]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:11.662]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:59:11.662 --> 00:59:14.943]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:59:14.943 --> 00:59:16.384]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:59:16.604 --> 00:59:20.926]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:59:20.926 --> 00:59:23.867]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:59:23.867 --> 00:59:25.528]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:59:25.528 --> 00:59:28.970]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:31.571]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:59:31.571 --> 00:59:32.631]  It's in powder form.
[00:59:32.631 --> 00:59:35.493]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:59:35.493 --> 00:59:36.633]  I take this.
[00:59:36.633 --> 00:59:38.034]  This is the product that I take.
[00:59:38.034 --> 00:59:40.015]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:59:40.815 --> 00:59:41.615]  We fight the Globals.
[00:59:41.615 --> 00:59:42.776]  We fight the New World Order.

[00:59:46.858 --> 00:59:48.178]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:13.655 --> 01:00:18.520]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.182]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:20.182 --> 01:00:21.863]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:21.863 --> 01:00:28.410]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:31.513]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:31.513 --> 01:00:32.234]  I'm David Knight.
[01:00:32.234 --> 01:00:37.339]  As we were talking about the Washington Post efforts to come up with a new pejorative term,
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:41.821]  A meme that they can throw at Donald Trump now.
[01:00:41.821 --> 01:00:50.762]  I guess the Hitler thing is getting so old, so tired, they're now going to call him the Manchurian candidate, implying that he is associated with Russia.
[01:00:50.762 --> 01:01:01.864]  And as I pointed out, the real guy that you have to be worried about being a foreign agent is the one with the secret identities, the multiple names, the hidden past, the forged birth certificate.
[01:01:01.864 --> 01:01:04.165]  We don't know where this guy came from, Barack Obama.
[01:01:04.724 --> 01:01:06.084]  We still don't know.
[01:01:06.084 --> 01:01:18.667]  That birth certificate is an absolute phony, and if you haven't seen the report that Darren McBrain put together with the people that worked on this with Sheriff Arpaio, you need to see that.
[01:01:18.667 --> 01:01:21.167]  That is a definitive collection of that.
[01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:26.488]  But they're continuing on with this, you know, he's a foreign agent tact.
[01:01:26.488 --> 01:01:29.649]  We've got Politico, of course, always opposing Donald Trump.
[01:01:30.029 --> 01:01:32.890]  Now talking about Pravda on the checkout line.
[01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:34.270]  Say Pravda on the checkout.
[01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:36.691]  Not talking about propaganda or fake news.
[01:01:36.691 --> 01:01:40.372]  We're going to call the National Enquirer Pravda.
[01:01:40.372 --> 01:01:43.492]  And they go in and they say, this is kind of interesting.
[01:01:43.492 --> 01:01:51.335]  They say, back in 1987, the Enquirer helped to scuttle Gary Hart's presidential ambitions when it published a cover photo of Donna Rice sitting on his lap.
[01:01:51.335 --> 01:01:56.816]  And in a 2008 series, it threw a saddle on John Edwards' presidential bid and rode it into the ground.
[01:01:57.523 --> 01:02:01.325]  But the tabloid's thrust has always been pure scandal.
[01:02:01.325 --> 01:02:06.067]  And really, you know, what they did, yeah, it was a character issue, wasn't it?
[01:02:06.067 --> 01:02:10.589]  But it paled compared to what Hillary Clinton did.
[01:02:10.589 --> 01:02:26.757]  And yet, their idea is that somehow, what the National Enquirer did, by routinely, as they point out, depicting Clinton as crazed, diseased, near-death, an ISIS-supporting traitor, a liar, a blackmailer, corrupt, and a member of a crime family,
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:28.664]  All of the above.
[01:02:28.664 --> 01:02:28.985]  Guilty.
[01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:32.991]  Is that no scandal?
[01:02:32.991 --> 01:02:34.012]  That's not a scandal?
[01:02:34.012 --> 01:02:48.344]  They say that, you know, these guys having extramarital affairs, and of course it was a big issue with John Edwards because his wife was very well respected in liberal circles and she had breast cancer, was dying of breast cancer, and here he is cheating on her.
[01:02:48.344 --> 01:02:51.927]  That was a big deal, big character issue, and that really hurt him.
[01:02:51.927 --> 01:02:59.073]  And yet, those things are personal character issues, but look at how broad the problems with Hillary Clinton are, and yet they're saying,
[01:03:00.388 --> 01:03:02.970]  They're not focusing on scandal here.
[01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:04.611]  Don't you think that's scandalous?
[01:03:04.611 --> 01:03:09.834]  I mean, violating national security, that's not a scandal to Politico.
[01:03:09.834 --> 01:03:13.235]  That's not something that National Enquirer should be reporting about.
[01:03:13.235 --> 01:03:16.257]  And they do the same sort of thing with Wikileaks.
[01:03:16.257 --> 01:03:20.980]  They attack them instead of attacking the information that they put out.
[01:03:21.889 --> 01:03:29.553]  They never said that anything that WikiLeaks gave us about Hillary Clinton, regardless of the source, they never said that any of that stuff was false.
[01:03:29.553 --> 01:03:32.275]  And now they're not saying, they don't make an argument that...
[01:03:33.628 --> 01:03:36.530]  The National Enquirer reporting on Hillary Clinton was false.
[01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:39.433]  That stuff is true, folks.
[01:03:39.433 --> 01:03:40.573]  That's why she lost the election.
[01:03:40.573 --> 01:03:44.116]  You can't get your head around it, but you're going to continue on with this.
[01:03:44.116 --> 01:03:45.817]  Trump is a foreign agent.
[01:03:45.817 --> 01:03:49.700]  That's a key part of all of this to try to destroy him.
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:58.467]  At the same time, we see a communist Chinese dictator about to speak at Davos, and they're bragging about the fact that he is going to be selling globalism.
[01:03:59.312 --> 01:04:01.213]  Do you see an irony in that?
[01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:27.066]  Do you see an irony with the fact that the most hyper-nationalistic, the most hegemonic country on earth, yeah they're a company, they have the most closed market, they violate copyright, left and right, they're the most notorious copyright pirates, that was what these trade agreements are supposed to shut down, they're currency manipulators, and yet they are champions of open trade globalism?
[01:04:28.308 --> 01:04:30.690]  You realize how we're being had here, don't you?
[01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:43.002]  You realize the phoniness of the Chinese coming out and saying that populism, protectionism, nativism, the world has come to a historic crossroad where one road leads to war, poverty and confrontation and domination.
[01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:45.209]  Now that's coming from the Chinese.
[01:04:45.209 --> 01:04:46.972]  They're the most aggressive of anybody.
[01:04:46.972 --> 01:04:50.016]  Yet we're told it's the Russians we have to worry about.
[01:04:50.016 --> 01:04:51.017]  Not ISIS.
[01:04:51.017 --> 01:04:53.060]  Did the Russians cut off anybody's heads?
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:53.800]  I don't think so.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:59.188]  Can't we try to work with them on common ground just like we do JFK, RFK Jr.? ?
[01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:11.897]  Yesterday, the Senate took the first step towards repealing the Affordable Care Act with a 51-48 vote on a new budget blueprint that would open the doors to gut and rid ourselves of the disaster that is Obamacare without allowing Democrats to filibuster.
[01:05:11.897 --> 01:05:24.701]  Liberal tears flowed heavy as the Senate had to be called in order every time a Democrat voted no, with a nice lecture to go with it, forcing the providing officer, Senator Cory Gardner, to slam his gavel and scold the Democrats, repeating ad nauseam, debate is not allowed during a vote.
[01:05:24.841 --> 01:05:27.903]  Now today the vote moves on to the House, where we have had similar results.
[01:05:27.903 --> 01:05:38.051]  The debate has been heated, with Democrats speaking past their time, bringing in large blown up photos of children to win sympathy points, and trying to argue that Republicans are ending healthcare, like before the Affordable Care Act, right?
[01:05:38.051 --> 01:05:50.301]  Senator Hakeem Jeffries claims that voting against the Affordable Care Act sets up Americans to be screwed by big wigs and fat cats in the healthcare industry, ignoring the fact that this is what the Affordable Care Act did, creating healthcare monopolies in some regions.
[01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:56.323]  He also said that Republicans had no plan, to which Republicans responded by showing the many plans they brought to the debate floor.
[01:05:56.323 --> 01:06:00.044]  This is Owen Troyer, and I've got jugs of liberal tears here.
[01:06:00.044 --> 01:06:04.525]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:06:04.525 --> 01:06:15.449]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:06:15.609 --> 01:06:20.652]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:06:20.652 --> 01:06:23.233]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:06:23.233 --> 01:06:24.954]  It helps detoxify.
[01:06:24.954 --> 01:06:27.836]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:06:27.836 --> 01:06:32.599]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:06:32.599 --> 01:06:38.862]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:06:38.862 --> 01:06:44.185]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:06:44.185 --> 01:06:44.966]  I'm taking it now.
[01:06:45.506 --> 01:06:49.608]  Man, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.
[01:06:49.608 --> 01:06:53.009]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.
[01:07:09.136 --> 01:07:20.401]  Nipple Wars Life has set out to bring you formulations that are not only the highest quality out there, but formulas that you can use on a daily basis to give your body the natural herbs and extracts that our experts recommend.
[01:07:20.401 --> 01:07:28.365]  The Prostagard formula does just that with its mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants that help give your body total support.
[01:07:28.365 --> 01:07:33.307]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols,
[01:07:33.827 --> 01:07:34.747]  Thank you.
[01:08:11.761 --> 01:08:14.023]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:19.528]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:08:30.521 --> 01:08:33.725]  Well, Obama has been a very, very busy person.
[01:08:33.725 --> 01:08:41.613]  He's sending masses of troops to the Russian-Polish border with seven days left, a major provocation.
[01:08:41.613 --> 01:08:45.357]  They put new sanctions in against Russia.
[01:08:45.357 --> 01:08:49.222]  There have been clear cyber attacks against independent media here in the United States.
[01:08:49.902 --> 01:08:53.304]  He's ended his wet foot, dry foot policy.
[01:08:53.304 --> 01:08:55.104]  Cuban migrants reaching U.S.
[01:08:55.104 --> 01:08:57.385]  soil were allowed to stay previously.
[01:08:57.385 --> 01:09:01.887]  Now they're the only group that basically can't seek political asylum.
[01:09:01.887 --> 01:09:06.789]  They just basically get sent back to the tyrant, to the tyrant's brother.
[01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:13.672]  They're in the Cuban liberty wonderland, similar to North Korea or Venezuela.
[01:09:14.574 --> 01:09:21.858]  But meanwhile, Biden is awarded the Medal of Freedom in a surprise ceremony brimming with emotion.
[01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:23.319]  Oh, lots of cheers.
[01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:30.062]  Obama presents VP, the nation's top civilian honor for the defense of liberty and freedom.
[01:09:30.062 --> 01:09:36.926]  Yeah, like his son, Biden's son, taking over the billions of dollars a year of natural gas coming out of Russia.
[01:09:38.141 --> 01:09:39.282]  Through Ukraine?
[01:09:39.282 --> 01:09:40.362]  That's a good family business.
[01:09:40.362 --> 01:09:51.949]  Just put your son over the energy company so he personally reportedly is going to make hundreds of millions of dollars off jacking up the gas prices, after they hijack it basically, into Europe.
[01:09:51.949 --> 01:09:53.510]  Yes, giving him an award.
[01:09:54.537 --> 01:10:11.146]  But the reason I'm popping in here during the transmission with David Knight and Mr. Schneider is I was thinking, you know, I've seen this meme put out by Dying MSM that I'm a Russian dupe and I'm a Russian idiot and I'm a moron.
[01:10:11.146 --> 01:10:15.989]  That's why I started my show 20 plus years ago before this controversy even existed the last year.
[01:10:15.989 --> 01:10:21.832]  That's why I promote the Second Amendment and sovereignty and national borders and private property.
[01:10:22.953 --> 01:10:25.714]  The right to religion, everything that made our country great.
[01:10:25.714 --> 01:10:28.695]  Yes, it's all because I'm a dupe of Putin.
[01:10:28.695 --> 01:10:29.875]  I don't speak Russian.
[01:10:29.875 --> 01:10:30.995]  I've never been to Russia.
[01:10:30.995 --> 01:10:32.376]  I've been on Russian TV.
[01:10:32.376 --> 01:10:36.657]  I've been on Portuguese and Japanese and British TV.
[01:10:36.657 --> 01:10:40.298]  But it is true that the Russians have pulled out from the oligarchs, the same globalists.
[01:10:40.298 --> 01:10:42.998]  So we do have a kinship.
[01:10:42.998 --> 01:10:44.819]  We do have some solidarity there.
[01:10:44.819 --> 01:10:51.401]  But what an insult to say that we're all Manchurian candidates and that we're idiot dupes.
[01:10:52.717 --> 01:10:54.058]  of Putin.
[01:10:54.058 --> 01:10:56.020]  Let me explain what's happening here.
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.802]  We have foreign globalist powers that have hijacked this nation.
[01:10:58.802 --> 01:11:00.023]  We know that.
[01:11:00.023 --> 01:11:01.464]  We have to keep hammering that.
[01:11:01.464 --> 01:11:10.591]  And these multinationals want us to transfer our sovereignty to these unaccountable secret global boards like TPP and the WTO through deals like NAFTA and GATT.
[01:11:10.591 --> 01:11:12.393]  It's not happening.
[01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:18.477]  We are declaring our sovereignty, we're declaring our individual liberty, and we're not going to be ruled by far-off secret cabals.
[01:11:18.477 --> 01:11:19.278]  It's over.
[01:11:19.278 --> 01:11:21.420]  So we're the ones standing up against
[01:11:22.822 --> 01:11:24.083]  The foreign takeover.
[01:11:24.083 --> 01:11:30.508]  We're the ones standing up against the traitors and the people trying to sell us out to globalism, they're the enemy.
[01:11:30.508 --> 01:11:39.656]  So all of you that support globalism, you're the idiot dupes that want to be slaves and don't want to control your own destiny and have sold out to this system.
[01:11:39.656 --> 01:11:47.863]  But I do want to say that Donald Trump, Ron Paul, and many others deserve a medal of freedom.
[01:11:47.863 --> 01:11:49.204]  If we were going to hand these things out,
[01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:51.731]  But they're the type of men that don't want awards.
[01:11:51.731 --> 01:11:54.172]  They just want results and freedom.
[01:11:54.172 --> 01:12:03.378]  Because what's promoting peace and freedom worldwide is not having a needless new Cold War that costs trillions of dollars with Russia.
[01:12:03.378 --> 01:12:04.819]  That's what we're breaking down here.
[01:12:04.819 --> 01:12:06.340]  That's what we're pushing.
[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:08.121]  That's what we're promoting.
[01:12:08.121 --> 01:12:13.645]  That's what, as a country and a world, we want is peace in our time.
[01:12:15.799 --> 01:12:18.381]  But taking a breath and settling down.
[01:12:18.381 --> 01:12:22.003]  The reason I get so upset is that we need to be upset.
[01:12:22.003 --> 01:12:23.284]  We need to get out of our comfort zone.
[01:12:23.284 --> 01:12:30.049]  We need to get out of our trances, get out of our hazes, get out of our daydreams and realize globalism is a nightmare.
[01:12:30.049 --> 01:12:34.231]  And only being awake is going to reverse that and gives us any chance of stopping it.
[01:12:34.231 --> 01:12:37.493]  And we've got a great chance of stopping it.
[01:12:37.493 --> 01:12:40.676]  But it is the people that have sold out to globalism that are the true traders.
[01:12:40.676 --> 01:12:41.856]  And they know that.
[01:12:41.856 --> 01:12:45.279]  And that's why, again, they twist reality and turn it back on to us.
[01:12:46.581 --> 01:12:53.583]  But really, all of us that have been promoting peace and freedom, aren't we the people that deserve the awards?
[01:12:53.583 --> 01:12:56.044]  And again, I'm not saying I won an award.
[01:12:56.044 --> 01:13:05.066]  I'm saying it's asinine to see Obama being given awards and to see Biden being given awards.
[01:13:05.066 --> 01:13:08.187]  And it turns these awards into complete jokes.
[01:13:08.187 --> 01:13:10.028]  I mean, a Nobel Peace Prize
[01:13:10.868 --> 01:13:13.012]  is the biggest joke in the world now.
[01:13:13.012 --> 01:13:22.307]  Even the committee last year admitted they had discredited themselves giving Obama a peace award with all these wars before he'd ever done anything, before he even got into office.
[01:13:22.307 --> 01:13:25.191]  And giving awards to Henry Kissinger and Al Gore.
[01:13:26.664 --> 01:13:31.648]  It's all nothing but propaganda offensives to prop up their failing facade.
[01:13:31.648 --> 01:13:33.910]  And they need to understand, they're losing.
[01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.371]  They failed.
[01:13:35.371 --> 01:13:41.036]  They tried to play this game that Karl Rove talked about where they're history's actors and they control reality.
[01:13:41.036 --> 01:13:49.603]  And that only works for so long because when you don't deliver freedom and prosperity to the people, but you're telling them that's what they're getting, they're going to begin to see through your lies.
[01:13:49.603 --> 01:13:53.226]  And at a certain point, they're not going to believe a word you say.
[01:13:54.451 --> 01:13:58.893]  You know, USA Today, in closing, has an article, Trump cabinet of disruptors ready to go.
[01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:01.375]  Nominees likely to lead agencies they battled.
[01:14:01.375 --> 01:14:03.816]  And they act like, oh, look how discredited Trump is.
[01:14:03.816 --> 01:14:04.836]  He's crazy.
[01:14:04.836 --> 01:14:07.217]  He's putting people in that will have gridlock.
[01:14:07.217 --> 01:14:10.379]  He's putting people in that will actually fight with folks.
[01:14:10.379 --> 01:14:11.480]  This is terrible.
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.121]  Yes, he put in people.
[01:14:14.121 --> 01:14:16.802]  He's putting in people that actually opposed globalism.
[01:14:16.802 --> 01:14:18.303]  That's what I told you about these nominees.
[01:14:18.303 --> 01:14:20.964]  It doesn't matter what big companies they came from.
[01:14:20.964 --> 01:14:23.486]  In those big companies, they battled globalism.
[01:14:24.491 --> 01:14:32.099]  And again, that's why the elite are panicking because look at how Trump's getting results out of the gates on Obamacare, you name it.
[01:14:32.099 --> 01:14:37.525]  And notice he said on Obamacare, I can leave this for the Democrats and have it destroy them, but it's going to hurt the American people.
[01:14:37.525 --> 01:14:40.288]  So we're going to reverse it and repeal it now.
[01:14:40.288 --> 01:14:45.773]  And of course, get criticized because no system's perfect, but we're going to do the best job we can because it's what we swore to do.
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.463]  Results, not theater.
[01:14:49.463 --> 01:14:52.307]  Reality, not fiction.
[01:14:52.307 --> 01:14:56.151]  There's a battle between fantasy land and the real world.
[01:14:56.151 --> 01:14:58.915]  And I want to be in the reality-based community.
[01:14:58.915 --> 01:15:03.080]  Now back to David Knight and Mr. Schneider at the InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:03.961]  InfoWars.com.
[01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:08.793]  Thank you, Alex, and I should point out these award ceremonies that we've got.
[01:15:08.793 --> 01:15:10.095]  Obama's Medal of Freedom.
[01:15:10.095 --> 01:15:17.341]  It's about as phony and silly as the Golden Globes Awards that we just saw, put out by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
[01:15:17.341 --> 01:15:27.950]  I guess this is the Medal of Freedom done by the Hollywood Foreign President Association that was given to Joe Biden, because everything about their ideas are foreign to America.
[01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:29.831]  As I pointed out in the last segment, Joe Biden
[01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:37.078]  Coming after Clarence Thomas saying you're not qualified to be a Supreme Court Justice because you believe in the idea of natural law and natural rights.
[01:15:37.078 --> 01:15:38.199]  It's like, wow.
[01:15:38.199 --> 01:15:39.921]  That's what this country was founded upon.
[01:15:39.921 --> 01:15:45.806]  So yeah, we've got the Hollywood foreign president handing out his awards now, about a week after the Golden Globes.
[01:15:45.806 --> 01:15:52.713]  Joining us now is Michael Snyder of the EconomicCollapseBlog.com and of course he's a frequent contributor to InfoWars.com.
[01:15:54.315 --> 01:15:59.180]  Michael, I want to talk to you first about this article that Alex and I have been talking about earlier in the show.
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:04.506]  Of course, we had Rosie O'Donnell come out today and say, hey, let's have martial law to stop Donald Trump.
[01:16:04.506 --> 01:16:07.529]  Of course, you know, she's kind of a failed Hollywood actress.
[01:16:07.529 --> 01:16:12.795]  She has a lot of friends in New York and Hollywood, but she has been fired by
[01:16:15.572 --> 01:16:18.173]  Oprah Winfrey, as Donald Trump gleefully pointed out.
[01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:24.196]  But nevertheless, she's putting this out there, and it is precisely what we've seen George Soros doing.
[01:16:24.196 --> 01:16:38.842]  As you point out in your article that we had at Infowars.com on January the 10th, you pointed out we've got people like Cornel West, we've got Bill Ayers, we've got Carl Dix of the Communist Party, they're all working to do the same sorts of things that we've seen George Soros organizing.
[01:16:39.322 --> 01:17:08.030]  Right after the election, and even organizing in the run-up to the election, all the attacks at all the Donald Trump rallies, the Black Lives Matter, going to war with the police, going to war with white people, even going to war with other black people in Chicago, as we see as many people killed during the eight years of President Obama in Chicago, their gun-free zone, as were killed soldiers who died in Iraq and Afghanistan during the George W. Bush administration, about 4,000 each of those cases.
[01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:14.406]  Talk to us about your concerns about what the anarchists are trying to do in terms of promoting martial law.
[01:17:15.888 --> 01:17:17.048]  Yeah, thank you, David.
[01:17:17.048 --> 01:17:20.849]  And people need to realize that this starts tomorrow.
[01:17:20.849 --> 01:17:30.892]  The radical left, the election of Donald Trump was perhaps the single most galvanizing moment in the history of the radical left, certainly since the days of Ronald Reagan, where they didn't expect Donald Trump to win.
[01:17:30.892 --> 01:17:32.613]  They kind of treated him as a big joke.
[01:17:32.613 --> 01:17:34.693]  But now that they've won, they're fired up.
[01:17:34.693 --> 01:17:35.594]  They're ready for battle.
[01:17:35.594 --> 01:17:36.654]  They're ready for war.
[01:17:36.654 --> 01:17:40.275]  While many, many patriots, many conservatives have kind of gone to sleep.
[01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:43.298]  Many Trump supporters said, hey, he won, so now the battle's over.
[01:17:43.298 --> 01:17:45.320]  The truth is the battle's just beginning.
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:56.410]  In fact, an organization known as refusefascism.org recently took out a full-page ad in the New York Times talking about how we need, must resist Donald Trump.
[01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:56.650]  And
[01:18:12.176 --> 01:18:15.900]  Is when the activism in Washington D.C.
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:16.321]  begins.
[01:18:16.321 --> 01:18:19.404]  People are going to start descending on Washington D.C.
[01:18:19.404 --> 01:18:23.088]  There's another organization as well known as Disrupt J20.
[01:18:23.088 --> 01:18:26.773]  They've got a hashtag that's going viral all over Twitter, all over Facebook.
[01:18:27.213 --> 01:18:28.414]  And that's another organization.
[01:18:28.414 --> 01:18:37.343]  There's multiple organizations all funded by the radical left, people like George Soros, all ultimately controlled and dominated by the globalists.
[01:18:37.343 --> 01:18:43.189]  But, you know, the people who are activists, they don't even realize necessarily where the money's coming from.
[01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:49.836]  All they know is they're being told that Donald Trump is Hitler, that he's the devil, that he must be resisted, basically to the left.
[01:18:50.436 --> 01:18:54.297]  Donald Trump is the personification of everything that's wrong with America.
[01:18:54.297 --> 01:18:59.698]  And so what they plan to do on Inauguration Day, they plan to disrupt the activities as much as possible.
[01:18:59.698 --> 01:19:02.098]  One of the big things they're planning are blockades.
[01:19:02.098 --> 01:19:07.500]  They're planning blockades of the major transportation routes into Washington D.C.
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:12.701]  and then the major transportation routes in and across the Inauguration Route.
[01:19:12.701 --> 01:19:14.481]  So they want to keep people from getting there.
[01:19:14.761 --> 01:19:24.186]  They want to get on the news because if there's a whole row of bodies across a major interstate or across a major parade route in Washington, D.C., that's going to get attention.
[01:19:24.186 --> 01:19:26.488]  That's going to get on the news, and that's what they want.
[01:19:26.488 --> 01:19:32.951]  So they say openly they want to force as much of the inauguration celebration as possible inside.
[01:19:32.951 --> 01:19:36.113]  They want to turn it into a riot, into chaos.
[01:19:36.113 --> 01:19:42.317]  They want to do whatever they can to disrupt things, to upset the proceedings, and to get attention for their cause.
[01:19:42.737 --> 01:19:46.721]  Yeah, of course, we're going to continue with Michael Schneider on the other side of the break.
[01:19:46.721 --> 01:19:53.868]  And of course, Michael, when they say they're going to create blockades, you know that's going to get violent with people just like they did at the Trump rallies.
[01:19:53.868 --> 01:19:56.170]  They aren't going to be content just to lay down in front.
[01:19:56.170 --> 01:19:57.151]  They're going to attack cars.
[01:19:57.151 --> 01:19:58.252]  They're going to attack people.
[01:19:58.252 --> 01:19:58.633]  Stay with us.
[01:19:58.633 --> 01:19:59.153]  We'll be right back.

[01:20:29.938 --> 01:20:32.680]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:38.585]  The active ingredient in turmeric, known as curcumin, is poorly absorbed into the cells due to its large particle size.
[01:20:38.585 --> 01:20:43.269]  But now, One Planet Nutrition has the answer for this powerful anti-inflammatory.

[01:23:31.067 --> 01:23:33.748]  The intoxicating way her beauty had overtaken him?
[01:23:33.748 --> 01:23:39.689]  Whatever the case back then, Jordan Dunleavy is still in love with the memory of Lauren, the woman he'd lost so many years before.
[01:23:39.689 --> 01:23:43.190]  In Bookstore on the Seine, the journey of a conspiracy analyst, author C.L.

[01:24:09.932 --> 01:24:11.213]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:11.213 --> 01:24:11.693]  I'm David Knight.
[01:24:11.693 --> 01:24:18.238]  We're talking to Michael Schneider of the Economic Collapse Blog.com, a frequent contributor here to InfoWars as well.
[01:24:18.238 --> 01:24:32.108]  We're talking about the run-up to the inauguration, and of course, in the run-up to the inauguration, we have people like Bill Ayers, people like Carl Dix, the Communist Party USA, as Michael Schneider just pointed out, and as he pointed out in his article, they're taking out ads in the New York Times.
[01:24:32.848 --> 01:24:33.368]  We're good.
[01:24:49.797 --> 01:24:50.378]  See everything.
[01:24:50.378 --> 01:24:55.023]  They don't really kind of talk about a left-right paradigm, the false dichotomy that we're sold about left and right.
[01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:57.405]  That truly in and of itself is a false paradigm.
[01:24:57.405 --> 01:25:02.410]  But to them, you're either with them, with the communists, or you are a fascist.
[01:25:02.410 --> 01:25:04.793]  And so that's a very telltale thing there that we see.
[01:25:04.793 --> 01:25:06.074]  We're going to get back to Michael Snyder.
[01:25:06.074 --> 01:25:07.315]  We want to talk about that.
[01:25:07.315 --> 01:25:09.538]  Alex wanted to talk about how do we focus the attention
[01:25:10.138 --> 01:25:11.279]  We're good to go.
[01:25:27.651 --> 01:25:36.015]  The provocations in Europe, as well as what's going on economically here at home, as we see layoffs with Walmart, as we see layoffs with Boeing.
[01:25:36.015 --> 01:25:42.718]  We see jobs that people say are coming back, but certainly it's not the wonderful economy that Obama and others have been talking about.
[01:25:43.317 --> 01:25:54.511]  Before we do, real quickly, I just want to remind you, as we're talking about this kind of unrest, as we pointed out last week in the wake of the shooting, and actually it wasn't that we introduced the products at that point in time.
[01:25:54.511 --> 01:26:00.238]  Media Matters, George Soros' organization, criticized me for trying to profiteer, they said, off of the shooting.
[01:26:00.798 --> 01:26:01.318]  We're good to go.
[01:26:20.387 --> 01:26:29.034]  They can push for more disarmament of people, but we say, look, if they're not going to let you have your guns, you can at least try to protect yourself, protect your family, especially when you're traveling.
[01:26:29.034 --> 01:26:31.076]  This happened in the luggage area.
[01:26:31.076 --> 01:26:38.562]  This guy travels reportedly with the only luggage he had was his gun, that he traveled from Alaska to Fort Lauderdale to shoot the place up.
[01:26:38.562 --> 01:26:40.383]  That in and of itself is very suspicious.
[01:26:40.383 --> 01:26:42.685]  There's a lot of suspicious things in that shooting.
[01:26:43.786 --> 01:26:48.988]  If you were there, if you had the cheapest form of this body armor that we sell, is an insert.
[01:26:48.988 --> 01:26:49.489]  It's about $200.
[01:26:49.489 --> 01:26:53.090]  And with that insert, you can put that in your backpack.
[01:26:53.090 --> 01:26:56.452]  And you've at least got something that is going to stop a bullet.
[01:26:56.452 --> 01:26:59.613]  This is a patented form of carbon nanotube technology.
[01:26:59.613 --> 01:27:03.435]  It's the lightest, strongest, most flexible body armor on the market.
[01:27:03.435 --> 01:27:05.035]  This is a state-of-the-art stuff, folks.
[01:27:05.035 --> 01:27:06.056]  It's only a quarter-inch thick.
[01:27:06.616 --> 01:27:09.679]  It's field-tested to stop the most powerful pistol rounds in production.
[01:27:09.679 --> 01:27:14.084]  It's waterproof, super lightweight, made in the USA, 20-year warranty.
[01:27:14.084 --> 01:27:20.651]  You will find it at TheInfoWarsStore.com, our exclusive line of tactical nanotechnology body armor.
[01:27:20.651 --> 01:27:29.200]  And we go from that insert that you can put into a backpack all the way up to a full bulletproof vest that previously only law enforcement had.
[01:27:30.183 --> 01:27:36.626]  That's something you need to think about, especially when we look at the fact that these crazy communists want to try to start riots in every city.
[01:27:36.626 --> 01:27:40.507]  That's their preferred way to do political activism.
[01:27:40.507 --> 01:27:42.028]  They don't want to debate you.
[01:27:42.028 --> 01:27:47.090]  They want to either fight you, censor you, or shoot you in most of these cases.
[01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:49.051]  So let's go back to Michael Snyder.
[01:27:49.051 --> 01:27:58.575]  Michael, when we look at the way they're talking about fascism, that is a dead giveaway as to the origins and the political tactics of these people, isn't it?
[01:27:59.933 --> 01:28:02.974]  Oh, it absolutely is, because it's all coming from the same place.
[01:28:02.974 --> 01:28:10.276]  You know, George Soros has funded and organized revolutions all over the world, and they do the same things over and over and over again.
[01:28:10.276 --> 01:28:20.178]  And now they've been planning for a couple of months now for this big event in Washington, D.C., and as far as the radical left is concerned, the war starts tomorrow.
[01:28:20.718 --> 01:28:31.490]  And so from January 14th to January 20th, leading up to January 20th, they're going to have protests, they're going to have events, they're going to try to get as much attention on themselves as possible, leading up to January 20th.
[01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:38.918]  Now of course they can't stop Donald Trump from being inaugurated, but what they want to do is they want to completely change the narrative of the day.
[01:28:38.918 --> 01:28:42.502]  If you remember past inaugurations, for example when Barack Obama was inaugurated,
[01:28:42.822 --> 01:28:44.624]  It was a big celebration.
[01:28:44.624 --> 01:28:52.112]  You know the whole nation came together and Barack Obama got out of the vehicle and walked the parade route and it was peaceful and people were cheering.
[01:28:52.112 --> 01:28:54.694]  They wanted to turn it into the exact opposite.
[01:28:54.694 --> 01:29:01.461]  Chaos and riots and they want to make sure Donald Trump maybe even doesn't even make it through the parade route.
[01:29:01.461 --> 01:29:05.325]  Now he's going to be inaugurated but what they want the news to show is chaos and
[01:29:06.246 --> 01:29:07.367]  Chaos and rioting.
[01:29:07.367 --> 01:29:13.632]  They want the news to show people angry, people shouting, people blocking the streets.
[01:29:13.632 --> 01:29:17.996]  And then ultimately, because they want to change the whole narrative, they want to say, hey, people are upset.
[01:29:17.996 --> 01:29:21.058]  And what they want to do also, they want to provoke a response.
[01:29:21.058 --> 01:29:23.500]  All these things are about provoking a response.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:29.826]  And so they want the National Guard and the authorities to crack down hard so they can say, hey, look, this is martial law.
[01:29:29.826 --> 01:29:31.467]  Look, they really are fascists.
[01:29:31.607 --> 01:29:32.128]  Absolutely.
[01:29:32.128 --> 01:29:41.276]  They're going to go from a love fest that they had with the media and Barack Obama, they're going to go, look, the country is torn apart by the presidency of Donald Trump.
[01:29:41.276 --> 01:29:44.819]  The media is waiting for this, waiting to pounce on this.
[01:29:44.819 --> 01:29:49.042]  This is all being performed as a kind of a kabuki dance.
[01:29:49.042 --> 01:29:51.244]  We'll be right back with Michael Snyder.
[01:29:51.244 --> 01:29:53.766]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.766 --> 01:29:56.449]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.365 --> 01:30:11.951]  Yesterday, the Senate took the first step towards repealing the Affordable Care Act with a 51-48 vote on a new budget blueprint that would open the doors to gut and rid ourselves of the disaster that is Obamacare without allowing Democrats to filibuster.
[01:30:11.951 --> 01:30:24.758]  Liberal tears flowed heavy as the Senate had to be called in order every time a Democrat voted no, with a nice lecture to go with it, forcing the providing officer, Senator Cory Gardner, to slam his gavel and scold the Democrats, repeating ad nauseam, debate is not allowed during a vote.
[01:30:24.878 --> 01:30:27.960]  Now today, the vote moves on to the House, where we have had similar results.
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:38.085]  The debate has been heated, with Democrats speaking past their time, bringing in large, blown-up photos of children to win sympathy points, and trying to argue that Republicans are ending healthcare, like before the Affordable Care Act, right?
[01:30:38.085 --> 01:30:50.332]  Senator Hakeem Jeffries claims that voting against the Affordable Care Act sets up Americans to be screwed by bigwigs and fat cats in the healthcare industry, ignoring the fact that this is what the Affordable Care Act did, creating healthcare monopolies in some regions.
[01:30:50.492 --> 01:30:56.274]  He also said that Republicans had no plan, to which Republicans responded by showing the many plans they brought to the debate floor.
[01:30:56.274 --> 01:31:00.055]  This is Owen Schroer, and I've got jugs of liberal tears here.
[01:31:00.055 --> 01:31:00.875]  Hey, everyone!
[01:31:00.875 --> 01:31:06.997]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:31:06.997 --> 01:31:09.078]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:31:09.078 --> 01:31:18.961]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:31:19.341 --> 01:31:19.661]  I think so.
[01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:40.550]  Thank you.
[01:31:59.795 --> 01:32:10.663]  National Defense Labs and Citizen Armor has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people the true next generation in body armor.
[01:32:10.663 --> 01:32:18.449]  Basically what we're bringing to the InfoWars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[01:32:18.449 --> 01:32:24.374]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[01:32:24.454 --> 01:32:30.619]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this actually testing for years, people that currently attested for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[01:32:30.619 --> 01:32:31.600]  What did they really say about this?
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:34.442]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[01:32:34.442 --> 01:32:38.165]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[01:32:38.165 --> 01:32:41.087]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[01:32:41.087 --> 01:32:42.948]  I mean it's unbelievable.
[01:32:42.948 --> 01:32:44.109]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[01:32:44.109 --> 01:32:45.130]  It's got a 20 year warranty.
[01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:45.790]  It's waterproof.
[01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:46.251]  You can wear it.
[01:32:46.251 --> 01:32:46.951]  It's comfortable.
[01:32:46.951 --> 01:32:49.073]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[01:32:49.073 --> 01:32:50.854]  Again, fund the Info Ward.
[01:32:50.854 --> 01:32:53.556]  Get the game changing nanotech tubes.
[01:32:53.556 --> 01:32:54.197]  It's a win-win.
[01:32:54.417 --> 01:32:55.677]  Two hundred dollars.
[01:32:55.677 --> 01:32:58.578]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:32:58.578 --> 01:33:02.720]  It's amazing.
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:06.301]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:06.301 --> 01:33:10.443]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:17.973 --> 01:33:19.275]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:19.275 --> 01:33:21.657]  I'm David Knight, and joining me now is Michael Schneider.
[01:33:21.657 --> 01:33:28.565]  We've been talking about his article, and of course, what is going to be happening in and around the inauguration.
[01:33:28.565 --> 01:33:29.906]  It's going to begin tomorrow.
[01:33:29.906 --> 01:33:39.857]  And of course, this is a program that's been put together by communist agitators, people like Bill Ayers, who hung out with the Weathermen, people who've openly talked about revolution for a long time.
[01:33:41.286 --> 01:33:52.798]  Joining with George Soros as we've seen both before the inauguration before the election and then immediately after the election and now they're bringing this up to the inauguration talking about Rosie O'Donnell talking about martial law.
[01:33:52.798 --> 01:33:54.579]  This is a common recurring theme.
[01:33:54.579 --> 01:34:00.966]  We're going to talk about again some of the things that may be happening a little bit more and then we're going to move on to what's going on in Poland.
[01:34:00.966 --> 01:34:03.869]  We now have Obama moving troops into Poland.
[01:34:04.429 --> 01:34:07.531]  Stationing them there permanently for the first time.
[01:34:07.531 --> 01:34:09.232]  These things are not unrelated.
[01:34:09.232 --> 01:34:20.099]  So we're going to pull these things together for you and show you how, even though in the past we used to have the people on the right would, rightly or wrongly, label people as communist sympathizers.
[01:34:20.099 --> 01:34:23.060]  Now you're labeled as a Russian sympathizer.
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:26.642]  And this is being done by people who are communist sympathizers like Bill Ayers.
[01:34:26.642 --> 01:34:30.585]  People who genuinely did want to provoke a communist revolution.
[01:34:30.585 --> 01:34:32.186]  And now that's what they're still trying to do.
[01:34:32.546 --> 01:34:33.547]  So we're going to talk about that.
[01:34:33.547 --> 01:34:43.013]  One of the things he mentions in his article here is how Michael Moore has announced that he plans to attend the Women's March on Washington.
[01:34:43.013 --> 01:34:45.554]  Is Michael Moore coming out?
[01:34:45.554 --> 01:34:46.515]  I don't know.
[01:34:46.515 --> 01:34:49.477]  Anyway, he's going to be there at the Women's March.
[01:34:49.477 --> 01:34:50.837]  He has made a call to arms.
[01:34:50.837 --> 01:34:54.560]  He says it's important for everybody to go there, he said on MSNBC.
[01:34:55.546 --> 01:34:58.808]  When we look at this, Michael, they're also talking about violence.
[01:34:58.808 --> 01:35:18.958]  One of the guys that you quoted here said, well, you said they're not openly telling people to throw projectiles, they're not openly telling people to jump barriers, and of course we've seen that happen at people jumping the barriers to get to Donald Trump, people throwing projectiles and getting physical with people who are just attending an event.
[01:35:19.498 --> 01:35:29.345]  But then they said this, he said, and here's a quote from one of the organizers, I can't comment on any specific stuff that we're doing like that, mostly because that would be illegal.
[01:35:30.708 --> 01:35:33.251]  We got stuff planned that is violent, illegal.
[01:35:33.251 --> 01:35:36.114]  Yeah, we do, but I can't give you any specifics on it.
[01:35:36.114 --> 01:35:37.936]  But yeah, it'll get pretty crazy, he said.
[01:35:37.936 --> 01:35:38.977]  I expect.
[01:35:38.977 --> 01:35:40.799]  Have fun, I say.
[01:35:40.799 --> 01:35:42.881]  That's the quote from one of the guys who organized this.
[01:35:42.881 --> 01:35:49.848]  And I remember, Michael, when I was in college, we had Gerald Ford come speak at our university.
[01:35:49.848 --> 01:35:53.252]  We had some guy thought it would be funny to show up with a squirt gun.
[01:35:54.232 --> 01:36:00.257]  When he was speaking and the Secret Service wrestled him to the ground and we never saw him again.
[01:36:00.257 --> 01:36:05.021]  I mean, seriously, this guy, he was gone for a long time, he never came back to school.
[01:36:05.021 --> 01:36:08.343]  I don't know what he did with the rest of his life, but he was just gone.
[01:36:08.343 --> 01:36:11.285]  But it's going to be interesting to see what happens with this.
[01:36:11.285 --> 01:36:19.712]  But as you pointed out, the real point is to get this photo op of chaos that the media can then use as a narrative to attack Trump, isn't it?
[01:36:21.076 --> 01:36:23.977]  Oh, it absolutely does, because they want to provoke a reaction.
[01:36:23.977 --> 01:36:38.660]  They want the television cameras, and they want the television cameras to see not only their protest and the anger, but they want to see the reaction, the cracking down on the protesters, and they want it to be as harsh as possible.
[01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:42.021]  And so they actually, they know the legalities of it.
[01:36:42.021 --> 01:36:46.962]  They know how far they can go up to the line, so they don't actually say, hey, we're advocating violence.
[01:36:47.242 --> 01:36:48.384]  But you notice what they're saying?
[01:36:48.384 --> 01:36:54.593]  They're saying, hey, we can't legally say that, but hey, we're not exactly discouraging people from it either.
[01:36:54.593 --> 01:36:55.995]  And that's just the start.
[01:36:55.995 --> 01:37:01.503]  And then the next day, after January 20th, January 21st is this Million Woman March.
[01:37:01.503 --> 01:37:03.386]  That's the march Michael Moore was talking about.
[01:37:03.706 --> 01:37:04.146]  We're good.
[01:37:21.573 --> 01:37:26.941]  What they want to do is they want to make Donald Trump's first 100 days as hard as possible.
[01:37:26.941 --> 01:37:31.568]  And Barack Obama, what Barack Obama is doing right now is playing right into that.
[01:37:31.568 --> 01:37:37.317]  Because when a new president is elected, the sitting president, the lame duck president,
[01:37:37.837 --> 01:37:40.038]  Well, traditionally, they've kind of stepped back.
[01:37:40.038 --> 01:37:43.159]  They've said, OK, I'm not going to introduce a bunch of new initiatives.
[01:37:43.159 --> 01:37:49.141]  I'm going to just try to make it an easy transition for the next guy, kind of stepping back and saying, OK, the new guy's coming in.
[01:37:49.141 --> 01:37:50.702]  I'm not going to rock the boat.
[01:37:50.702 --> 01:37:53.143]  But instead, Barack Obama has done just the opposite.
[01:37:53.143 --> 01:37:54.183]  He's been malicious.
[01:37:54.183 --> 01:38:01.566]  He's been going crazy, passing all types of new rules and regulations, establishing national monuments, giving this medal to Joe Biden.
[01:38:01.826 --> 01:38:04.007]  And it just wasn't the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
[01:38:04.007 --> 01:38:09.448]  It was the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, which has only been done three times in history.
[01:38:09.448 --> 01:38:13.349]  Once for Pope John Paul, once for Ronald Reagan.
[01:38:13.349 --> 01:38:16.030]  So, I mean, it was just such a farce, so ridiculous.
[01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:25.753]  But basically, Barack Obama's trying to squeeze every ounce of presidential power as possible out of his remaining time in the White House, including provoking Russia.
[01:38:25.993 --> 01:38:28.754]  With this moving of troops into Poland.
[01:38:28.754 --> 01:38:30.775]  I mean, this is the first time it's ever happened.
[01:38:30.775 --> 01:38:34.536]  It didn't get a lot of attention here in the U.S.
[01:38:34.536 --> 01:38:36.456]  media, but this is a really big deal.
[01:38:36.456 --> 01:38:46.980]  It's just a few thousand troops, but what this does is it's highly symbolic, because it's really poking the bear, poking Russia, because it's very much aggravating Russia.
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:50.641]  Because you have to remember, Poland was a member of the Warsaw Pact.
[01:38:51.221 --> 01:38:57.766]  And so, to Russia, and it's right close to Russia, so Russia is very, very annoyed by this.
[01:38:57.766 --> 01:39:03.689]  And we're also, in late January, NATO troops are going to be stationed from now on in Lithuania.
[01:39:03.689 --> 01:39:10.294]  So, NATO troops are going into Lithuania, which is actually part of the Soviet Union, back in the old days.
[01:39:10.294 --> 01:39:13.116]  So, David, this is a very, very big deal.
[01:39:13.567 --> 01:39:18.689]  Yeah, we've had an escalation as we've seen with the so-called Russian reset.
[01:39:18.689 --> 01:39:20.991]  We've had the reset of the Cold War.
[01:39:20.991 --> 01:39:26.973]  And it's not, this is permanently putting there, of course, they've had multiple exercises, as you know, Michael.
[01:39:26.973 --> 01:39:30.375]  They've had multiple NATO exercises that come right up to the Russian border.
[01:39:30.655 --> 01:39:30.895]  I don't
[01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:49.403]  Put missiles in Cuba for example.
[01:39:49.403 --> 01:39:50.824]  We know exactly what happened with that.
[01:39:50.824 --> 01:39:52.305]  Or if they were to go to Venezuela.
[01:39:52.305 --> 01:40:03.394]  Or if things were to get frostier with the US and Mexico and somehow Russia or China or say North Korea were to forward place missiles right in Mexico.
[01:40:03.394 --> 01:40:05.696]  That's the way the Russians see this.
[01:40:05.696 --> 01:40:07.478]  And rightfully so.
[01:40:07.478 --> 01:40:09.299]  It is deliberately provocative.
[01:40:09.299 --> 01:40:11.901]  They're trying to be provocative in the same way
[01:40:12.702 --> 01:40:18.728]  That we have Bill Ayers and these communist organizers are trying to be provocative at the inauguration.
[01:40:18.728 --> 01:40:22.972]  And they're trying to provoke an event, just like all these people are.
[01:40:22.972 --> 01:40:24.773]  That's precisely what they're trying to do.
[01:40:24.773 --> 01:40:25.754]  It's a very dangerous thing.
[01:40:25.754 --> 01:40:35.063]  And one of the things that really disturbs me, Michael, is the fact that anyone who says we don't want to escalate tensions, we want to de-escalate tensions, it used to be a virtue
[01:40:35.683 --> 01:40:42.247]  When Richard Nixon said, we're going to have a policy of detente, we're going to ease this strained relationship between the US and Russia.
[01:40:42.247 --> 01:40:43.408]  Everybody said, that's great.
[01:40:43.408 --> 01:40:44.929]  We're kind of tired of a Cold War.
[01:40:44.929 --> 01:40:47.690]  We don't want to live on the edge of nuclear war.
[01:40:47.690 --> 01:40:52.773]  These people, for the purpose of the military-industrial complex now, want to restart this.
[01:40:52.773 --> 01:40:56.376]  And if you say that you don't want this, you don't want war,
[01:40:57.296 --> 01:41:05.024]  Then these radicals on the left start accusing you and mainstream media like Washington Post, New York Times start accusing you of being a Russian agent.
[01:41:05.024 --> 01:41:06.786]  You're a Manchurian candidate.
[01:41:06.786 --> 01:41:11.311]  The papers that come out and told the truth about Hillary Clinton, they were probed.
[01:41:11.311 --> 01:41:13.793]  I mean, this is the tactic that they're taking.
[01:41:13.793 --> 01:41:17.096]  Anybody who doesn't want war with Russia is a Russian agent.
[01:41:17.096 --> 01:41:17.737]  This is insane.
[01:41:19.625 --> 01:41:20.586]  Yeah, it absolutely is.
[01:41:20.586 --> 01:41:21.927]  And look how far we've come.
[01:41:21.927 --> 01:41:33.078]  Because just four years ago, if you remember the 2012 election, you know, and Mitt Romney, there was that famous moment in the debate when Mitt Romney was explaining how, hey, he believed Russia was a threat.
[01:41:33.078 --> 01:41:37.502]  And Barack Obama turned to him and said, hey, Mitt, you know, the 1980s are calling.
[01:41:37.502 --> 01:41:38.924]  They want their foreign policy back.
[01:41:39.304 --> 01:41:45.631]  You know, so four years ago, Barack Obama was mocking all this, but now Barack Obama says Russia is enemy number one.
[01:41:45.631 --> 01:41:48.414]  It's not just the Democrats, but it's the Republicans too.
[01:41:48.414 --> 01:41:51.337]  People like Senator John McCain, people like Lindsey Graham.
[01:41:51.337 --> 01:41:53.779]  And so it's a bipartisan thing.
[01:41:53.779 --> 01:41:58.424]  Both sides of the establishment party, if you will, both Democrats and Republicans.
[01:41:58.424 --> 01:42:00.827]  And so I believe this is a trap for Donald Trump.
[01:42:01.227 --> 01:42:05.831]  Because both parties are going to be putting pressure on him to become more anti-Russia.
[01:42:05.831 --> 01:42:11.096]  And Donald Trump is going to be surrounded by all these guys in the Pentagon, even Mad Dog Mattis.
[01:42:11.096 --> 01:42:15.460]  He was just in front of Congress yesterday talking about how Russia was the primary threat to U.S.
[01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:15.901]  security.
[01:42:16.261 --> 01:42:25.808]  So these people are going to be in his ear, people on the left, people on the right, Republicans and Democrats are all going to be urging Trump to become more anti-Russia.
[01:42:25.808 --> 01:42:36.595]  And so Donald Trump has got to be strong and we've got to urge him not to listen to these people, not to listen to both political parties, because they're going to want him to turn on Russia, become so anti-Russia.
[01:42:40.098 --> 01:42:43.542]  We should be so thankful that Donald Trump is about to be inaugurated.
[01:42:43.542 --> 01:42:48.788]  January 20th can't come fast enough because right now we are on a path to war with Russia.
[01:42:48.788 --> 01:42:54.134]  When Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats, that's the kind of thing you do before a war starts.
[01:42:54.614 --> 01:43:09.626]  You know, and so all these things, I mean, it's been going on for years with Ukraine, where George Soros and other people of his ilk went in and funded and organized and helped overthrow the democratically elected government of Ukraine.
[01:43:09.626 --> 01:43:13.049]  Then a new pro-American government was immediately installed.
[01:43:13.049 --> 01:43:16.492]  That severely, severely upset the Russians.
[01:43:16.492 --> 01:43:18.093]  That very, very much angered them.
[01:43:18.093 --> 01:43:20.595]  And that was kind of the one of the big first steps.
[01:43:20.595 --> 01:43:22.317]  And then, of course, with Syria, where
[01:43:22.617 --> 01:43:28.220]  We went in, we made a big mess of the Middle East and Russia came in and fought ISIS and helped the Syrian government.
[01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:31.182]  Tensions between us and them have risen there.
[01:43:31.182 --> 01:43:37.425]  So those were big steps down the path and so many things now with cyber espionage, the price of oil, everything else.
[01:43:37.425 --> 01:43:44.689]  The tensions between the United States and Russia are the worst they've been since the heart of the Cold War, maybe since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:43:44.689 --> 01:43:46.730]  We're on a path to war with Russia.
[01:43:46.730 --> 01:43:50.452]  Hopefully Donald Trump will stop us and set us on a better course.
[01:43:51.192 --> 01:44:06.919]  And as I said earlier, we haven't seen Russians rounding people up, cutting their heads off, putting them in cages and drowning them, doing all these bizarre and disturbing forms of torture, having little children murder bound men and put the videos up.
[01:44:06.919 --> 01:44:08.039]  The Russians aren't doing that.
[01:44:08.039 --> 01:44:11.761]  That's Islamic jihadis, Islamic terrorists.
[01:44:11.761 --> 01:44:15.743]  Those phrases that Obama can't even bring himself to state.
[01:44:16.443 --> 01:44:26.707]  And yet it is Obama, it is the people that you pointed out, John McCain, Lindsey Graham, they go and they work with Al-Qaeda, they work with ISIS, they work with Al-Nusra, all these different names that they come up with.
[01:44:26.707 --> 01:44:32.128]  They're just aliases for the same group of jihadi terrorists, the same philosophy that's there.
[01:44:32.128 --> 01:44:36.130]  And it came out that John Kerry was willing to do anything.
[01:44:36.710 --> 01:44:38.551]  In Syria, in order to have regime change.
[01:44:38.551 --> 01:44:40.371]  He didn't care that the place was set on fire.
[01:44:40.371 --> 01:44:46.553]  He didn't care how many children were killed, like the Lapo boy that we saw, the pitiful pictures of those children there.
[01:44:46.553 --> 01:44:47.513]  He didn't care about that.
[01:44:47.513 --> 01:44:51.534]  He didn't care about the fact that he was empowering ISIS in that area.
[01:44:51.534 --> 01:44:54.315]  They were willing to do that for their own objectives.
[01:44:54.315 --> 01:44:58.656]  And yet, you're told that the Russians, the people, the only people who were fighting them, by the way,
[01:44:59.096 --> 01:45:00.938]  It's not the Americans, we're helping them.
[01:45:00.938 --> 01:45:05.763]  We dropped 25,000 bombs and not a single bomb landed on an ISIS-controlled oil field.
[01:45:05.763 --> 01:45:06.984]  What a coincidence.
[01:45:06.984 --> 01:45:08.586]  And so, yeah, you're exactly right.
[01:45:08.586 --> 01:45:12.089]  We need to really understand, I think people do understand where the true threat is.
[01:45:12.089 --> 01:45:22.940]  When we look at this, and you pointed out Mattis in the confirmation hearings, and we've heard some disturbing things from Mattis, we've heard some disturbing things from Tillerson that are contradictory to what we've heard from Donald Trump.
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:26.703]  Uh, as RT was pointing out, they're concerned that maybe the deep state is winning.
[01:45:26.703 --> 01:45:32.148]  Maybe these guys are throwing up the flag that said Trump finally conceded that Russia hacked the election.
[01:45:32.148 --> 01:45:38.675]  I know that they're doing some things in these confirmation hearings, and when Donald Trump says that, he's just trying to say, okay, fine, let's just move on with this.
[01:45:39.515 --> 01:45:43.179]  Personally, I don't think that's the way to handle this, but these guys are a lot more successful than I am.
[01:45:43.179 --> 01:45:46.462]  I'm willing to give them a chance to at least get in there.
[01:45:46.462 --> 01:45:53.209]  So when we look at Tillerson, they questioned him on things like climate change and other issues like that.
[01:45:53.209 --> 01:45:54.650]  And he really did hedge his bet.
[01:45:54.650 --> 01:45:59.075]  He wouldn't give them a straight answer as to whether or not he believed that it was man-made.
[01:45:59.075 --> 01:46:01.097]  He said the risk of climate change does exist.
[01:46:01.597 --> 01:46:08.307]  And the consequences of it could be serious enough that action should be taken, but the ability to predict it is very limited.
[01:46:08.307 --> 01:46:15.358]  And so then, finally, Tim Kaine comes after him and says, well, do you lack the knowledge to answer my question, or are you refusing to answer my question?
[01:46:15.358 --> 01:46:17.201]  And Tillerson said, a little of both.
[01:46:18.666 --> 01:46:21.428]  That's probably the funniest thing that's come out of the hearings.
[01:46:21.428 --> 01:46:24.971]  That was probably the most truthful, candid thing right there.
[01:46:24.971 --> 01:46:28.873]  Yeah, you know, I kind of can't answer your question.
[01:46:28.873 --> 01:46:30.815]  I refuse to answer your question.
[01:46:30.815 --> 01:46:32.516]  And hopefully that's what's going on here.
[01:46:32.516 --> 01:46:35.859]  Hopefully these people are not going to be changing the direction that Trump is going.
[01:46:35.859 --> 01:46:38.420]  Hopefully they're not going to be running in the opposite direction.
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:40.982]  We saw that happen a great deal during the Reagan administration.
[01:46:40.982 --> 01:46:44.965]  Hopefully he can keep them going or replace them if they're going in the other direction.
[01:46:46.726 --> 01:46:56.392]  When we look at some of the rhetoric that's coming out of these confirmation hearings, I think they're just kind of trying to just get through this without any controversy and say, yeah, I agree with you on all these issues.
[01:46:56.392 --> 01:46:58.233]  What do you think, Michael?
[01:46:58.233 --> 01:47:03.516]  I think there's some of that going on, David, but also we need to keep in account, D.C.
[01:47:03.516 --> 01:47:04.497]  changes people.
[01:47:04.497 --> 01:47:07.638]  I used to work there and so, you know, I kind of saw it up close.
[01:47:07.638 --> 01:47:13.402]  But we've seen for decades, you know, good people, good politicians that we thought would do good things go to D.C.
[01:47:14.102 --> 01:47:15.162]  And they get changed.
[01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:16.963]  And all of a sudden they start talking differently.
[01:47:16.963 --> 01:47:17.963]  They have different viewpoints.
[01:47:17.963 --> 01:47:19.424]  Now there's some exceptions.
[01:47:19.424 --> 01:47:20.904]  For example, Ron Paul.
[01:47:20.904 --> 01:47:23.485]  He was never changed by D.C.
[01:47:23.485 --> 01:47:28.247]  But to a very large extent, a lot of these politicians, they promise us all these things.
[01:47:28.247 --> 01:47:29.908]  They talk really well.
[01:47:29.908 --> 01:47:31.528]  But then they get to D.C.
[01:47:31.528 --> 01:47:32.969]  and things change.
[01:47:32.969 --> 01:47:34.989]  And of course that observation is hundreds of years old.
[01:47:34.989 --> 01:47:35.990]  You know, power corrupts.
[01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:37.550]  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:47:37.550 --> 01:47:41.091]  Boy, you don't have any place where there is more absolute power than in Washington.
[01:47:41.091 --> 01:47:42.752]  That's why we have so much corruption there, isn't it?
[01:47:44.102 --> 01:48:02.141]  Oh absolutely and so and and it's even worse when both sides of the Republicans and the Democrats are all on the same side with as far as this Russia thing is concerned you know because we desperately need a different path because right now we see the anti-Russia
[01:48:02.821 --> 01:48:04.202]  Rhetoric here in this country.
[01:48:04.202 --> 01:48:09.026]  Over in Russia, they view the United States as the great force for evil in the world.
[01:48:09.026 --> 01:48:19.094]  You know, back in World War II, you know, the Russians, you know, they said, hey, Nazi Germany is the great force for evil in the world, and Russia believes that they played the biggest role in saving the world from that threat.
[01:48:19.094 --> 01:48:30.443]  Now, and then they fast forward that to today, and they say now, once again, Russia's the great force for defending against globalism, against all these things, and they believe the United States is a great force for evil in the world.
[01:48:30.703 --> 01:48:34.105]  And of course the United States has been leading the march of globalism.
[01:48:34.105 --> 01:48:39.027]  We have been funding groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda in the Middle East trying to overthrow the Syrian government.
[01:48:39.027 --> 01:48:49.873]  And when Russia goes on television and shows that, hey, ISIS oil trucks have been rolling into Turkey and oil's been being sold through Turkey and Obama knew about it the whole time.
[01:48:50.413 --> 01:48:51.554]  You know, they're right.
[01:48:51.554 --> 01:48:53.255]  Russia's right when they show that.
[01:48:53.255 --> 01:48:55.496]  And we have done some horrible things.
[01:48:55.496 --> 01:48:59.999]  But the Russian population sees this and they say, oh, how horrible the United States is.
[01:48:59.999 --> 01:49:05.422]  And in fact, Gallup, middle of last year, they went over and they took a survey over in Russia.
[01:49:05.422 --> 01:49:08.264]  They asked the Russian people about their approval of current U.S.
[01:49:08.264 --> 01:49:09.124]  leadership, i.e.
[01:49:09.124 --> 01:49:10.765]  the Obama administration.
[01:49:10.765 --> 01:49:14.368]  The results came back with a 1% approval rating.
[01:49:14.368 --> 01:49:16.289]  1% for current U.S.
[01:49:16.289 --> 01:49:17.109]  leadership.
[01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:19.831]  So that's how the Russians view the United States today.
[01:49:20.211 --> 01:49:26.454]  Yes, that's why they were so excited with the election of Donald Trump.
[01:49:26.454 --> 01:49:28.235]  They believed that they had dodged a bullet.
[01:49:28.235 --> 01:49:30.196]  We report on the story about the small town in Russia.
[01:49:41.841 --> 01:49:47.362]  That wanted to change the name of the street that the communists had called Godless Street.
[01:49:47.362 --> 01:49:48.222]  They wanted to change it.
[01:49:48.222 --> 01:49:50.843]  They had started a petition to change it to Donald Trump Street.
[01:49:50.843 --> 01:50:00.865]  I mean, they realize they have in their own collective memory the understanding of the horrors of war from World War II in a way that we don't in America.
[01:50:00.865 --> 01:50:05.145]  We were attacked at Pearl Harbor, but we never had anybody invade and bomb the homeland.
[01:50:05.145 --> 01:50:07.886]  We didn't have to fight them street by street in the cities.
[01:50:07.886 --> 01:50:08.306]  They did.
[01:50:08.906 --> 01:50:09.186]  I don't
[01:50:30.223 --> 01:50:38.487]  pandering to the senators who want war so they can get in, but don't really believe that Russia annexed the Crimea.
[01:50:38.487 --> 01:50:39.948]  I mean, we talk about that, really?
[01:50:39.948 --> 01:50:48.892]  I mean, yeah, they annexed the Crimea, but it was done by Catherine the Great in 1783, six years before we had the Constitution.
[01:50:48.892 --> 01:50:51.113]  And she took it from the Ottoman Empire.
[01:50:51.113 --> 01:50:54.135]  It wasn't that Putin took it from Ukraine.
[01:50:54.135 --> 01:50:58.657]  And they voted to stay with Russia, just like Northern Ireland voted to stay with Great Britain.
[01:50:58.657 --> 01:50:59.197]  When we come back,
[01:50:59.457 --> 01:51:01.359]  We're going to talk to Michael Snyder about what we can do.

[01:52:00.410 --> 01:52:11.275]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[01:52:15.437 --> 01:52:17.598]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[01:52:17.598 --> 01:52:23.020]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:33.202]  What happens with the Formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[01:52:33.202 --> 01:52:39.664]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[01:52:39.664 --> 01:52:42.985]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[01:52:42.985 --> 01:52:45.045]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[01:52:45.045 --> 01:52:48.146]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[01:52:48.166 --> 01:52:48.946]  Maybe not today.
[01:52:48.946 --> 01:52:50.127]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:52:50.127 --> 01:52:53.548]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:52:53.548 --> 01:52:54.548]  Forget bunkers.

[01:54:09.466 --> 01:54:10.669]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:19.687]  I'm David Knight and we have Michael Schneider with EconomicCollapseBlog.com joining us before we get back to... and I want to ask Michael the question that...
[01:54:20.971 --> 01:54:33.416]  Alex Jones wanted us to talk about, and that is what can be done to focus attention on these tactics of disruption, of trying to create martial law that we see, of trying to burn down the Trump administration.
[01:54:33.416 --> 01:54:36.397]  What is it that we can do that the public can do?
[01:54:36.397 --> 01:54:46.040]  What can you as a member of the public, because it's not just us talking about these issues, but it's also important for you to push this out yourself.
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:48.301]  I think one of the key things that's going to be at the inauguration
[01:54:48.781 --> 01:54:50.042]  People, keep your phones going.
[01:54:50.042 --> 01:54:52.944]  You're going to have your phones, you're going to be videotaping this stuff anyway.
[01:54:52.944 --> 01:55:01.149]  But of course, if you see these people instigating stuff, you can be the eyes on the ground that we can use to push back against the mainstream media's narrative.
[01:55:01.149 --> 01:55:06.132]  They want this to show the police as being the aggressors.
[01:55:06.132 --> 01:55:07.953]  If the police are the aggressors, fine.
[01:55:07.953 --> 01:55:09.093]  Let's show that.
[01:55:09.093 --> 01:55:11.695]  But that's not going to be the case, I don't think, in this particular case.
[01:55:11.875 --> 01:55:12.256]  That's right.
[01:55:28.735 --> 01:55:32.678]  Put up a special for a 2017 Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative.
[01:55:32.678 --> 01:55:35.920]  Very important this time of year to set up healthy habits.
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:46.848]  And one of the things that you can do is make sure that you have the right kind of nutrients, essential minerals to fight the toxic garbage that you're going to find in your food, your water, and your air.
[01:55:46.848 --> 01:55:50.730]  And also to give your body the nutritional support that it needs.
[01:55:50.730 --> 01:55:53.833]  And we've put a lot of things on sale from 10% to 20% to 30%.
[01:55:53.833 --> 01:55:54.233]  We've got a
[01:55:57.515 --> 01:55:59.016]  New shipment now of DNA Force.
[01:55:59.016 --> 01:56:00.757]  It's just arrived at Infowarslife.com.
[01:56:00.757 --> 01:56:02.118]  That's been out for some time.
[01:56:02.118 --> 01:56:09.683]  And of course, DNA Force is a powerful lineup of patented ingredients like Bio-PQQ and systemic enzymes.
[01:56:09.683 --> 01:56:13.806]  We have 175 clinical studies that show how effective Bio-PQQ is.
[01:56:14.406 --> 01:56:15.487]  Look those up yourself.
[01:56:15.487 --> 01:56:17.368]  Just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[01:56:17.368 --> 01:56:23.553]  It's very difficult to produce, very expensive to produce, so 10% is a big discount.
[01:56:23.553 --> 01:56:25.655]  And also move on this while it is still there.
[01:56:25.655 --> 01:56:33.041]  We've just gotten a temporary emergency shipment of this, so when that goes out, it could be months before we are able to put that back in again.
[01:56:33.041 --> 01:56:35.383]  Also, if you want to make sure that you support that
[01:56:36.103 --> 01:56:37.424]  Healthy habits that you get in.
[01:56:37.424 --> 01:56:39.886]  Make sure that you always have the supplements that you want.
[01:56:39.886 --> 01:56:41.347]  You can sign up for AutoShip.
[01:56:41.347 --> 01:56:44.829]  Always get a 10% discount on the things that you get on AutoShip.
[01:56:44.829 --> 01:56:48.292]  If you get more than $50 at a time, you'll also get free shipping.
[01:56:48.292 --> 01:56:52.915]  But right now we also have 20% off Secret 12, our vitamin B12.
[01:56:52.915 --> 01:56:55.616]  20% off Liver Shield, Knockout, and Prostagard.
[01:56:55.616 --> 01:56:58.498]  We have 30% off Survival Shield, X2 nascent iodine.
[01:56:58.498 --> 01:57:01.220]  30% off Super Male Vitality.
[01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:02.461]  30% off Brain Force.
[01:57:02.461 --> 01:57:03.462]  You'll find all of those
[01:57:07.004 --> 01:57:10.765]  So, Michael, we're going to put this story back up to the top that you wrote.
[01:57:10.765 --> 01:57:15.108]  Anarchists are hoping to turn Donald Trump's inauguration into one of the biggest riots in U.S.
[01:57:15.108 --> 01:57:15.368]  history.
[01:57:15.368 --> 01:57:15.988]  We'll put that there.
[01:57:15.988 --> 01:57:19.850]  We'll cut this interview and put that in there as well as an update.
[01:57:19.850 --> 01:57:23.892]  But apart from that, apart from passing information around, what would you suggest that people do?
[01:57:25.373 --> 01:57:26.893]  Well that's one of the biggest things, David.
[01:57:26.893 --> 01:57:30.474]  People need to realize we're still in an information war.
[01:57:30.474 --> 01:57:35.335]  And just look at this recent thing with the ridiculous allegations that were made against Donald Trump.
[01:57:35.335 --> 01:57:41.517]  These were put forth seriously by BuzzFeed, by CNN, and they wanted people to believe this stuff.
[01:57:41.517 --> 01:57:45.538]  But then the alternative media started making all kinds of noise about, hey, this is fake.
[01:57:45.578 --> 01:57:45.898]  I don't
[01:58:02.705 --> 01:58:02.985]  We're good
[01:58:22.777 --> 01:58:23.698]  Absolutely.
[01:58:23.698 --> 01:58:26.339]  Everyone can become foot soldiers in the information war.
[01:58:26.339 --> 01:58:26.959]  Absolutely.
[01:58:26.959 --> 01:58:28.140]  We're out of time for this segment.
[01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:30.241]  We're going to be right back right after the break, short break.
[01:58:30.241 --> 01:58:31.722]  We're going to be back with Michael Snyder.
[01:58:31.722 --> 01:58:33.903]  We're going to talk about some economic issues.
[01:58:33.903 --> 01:58:37.144]  His other article, why are Walmart and Boeing layoff workers if the U.S.
[01:58:37.144 --> 01:58:39.326]  economy is in the great shape that Obama says it is.
[01:58:39.326 --> 01:58:41.987]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:41.987 --> 01:58:45.369]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:21.725]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:00:21.725 --> 02:00:26.067]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:26.067 --> 02:00:30.249]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:00:30.249 --> 02:00:31.830]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.143 --> 02:00:36.464]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:36.464 --> 02:00:41.229]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Michael Snyder of the EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[02:00:41.229 --> 02:00:45.854]  We've got one more segment here with Michael and then we're going to be talking to Craig Richardson.
[02:00:45.854 --> 02:00:51.460]  He is president of the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, E&E Legal.
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:58.487]  And we're going to talk to him amongst other things about their paper, The Rockefeller Way, the family's covert climate change plan.
[02:00:58.487 --> 02:01:03.312]  In other words, you know, what is really behind this climate change agenda?
[02:01:03.312 --> 02:01:06.796]  And we have seen an explosion in regulations at the last minute.
[02:01:07.336 --> 02:01:09.997]  From Barack Obama, and guess where most of them are coming?
[02:01:09.997 --> 02:01:11.958]  They're coming from the EPA.
[02:01:11.958 --> 02:01:13.399]  They're coming every day.
[02:01:13.399 --> 02:01:16.601]  The EPA is trying to shut down another major car company.
[02:01:16.601 --> 02:01:30.348]  So we're going to talk to him about what he thinks is going to happen in a Trump administration, because he's already picked somebody as the head of the EPA that has taken on the EPA in the past for their overreach, their unconstitutional, illegal overreach.
[02:01:30.788 --> 02:01:34.174]  But going back to Michael, I want to talk to you about this article you have.
[02:01:34.174 --> 02:01:37.158]  Why are Walmart and Boeing laying off workers if the U.S.
[02:01:37.158 --> 02:01:39.542]  economy is in such good shape?
[02:01:39.542 --> 02:01:40.664]  What do you think is going on here?
[02:01:40.664 --> 02:01:43.128]  Tell people what's going on and what you think is behind it.
[02:01:44.284 --> 02:01:47.087]  Well, I think what is going on is a retail apocalypse.
[02:01:47.087 --> 02:01:51.833]  We're talking about the biggest retailers in the United States, legendary names.
[02:01:51.833 --> 02:02:01.585]  We're talking about Walmart laying off, you know, a thousand workers, you know, most of them at their headquarters there in Bentonville, Arkansas.
[02:02:01.585 --> 02:02:03.728]  You know, and if you go into Walmart today, you'll notice
[02:02:04.088 --> 02:02:04.248]  I think?
[02:02:21.988 --> 02:02:22.068]  Yeah.
[02:02:39.119 --> 02:02:41.781]  They're losing hundreds of millions of dollars every quarter.
[02:02:41.781 --> 02:02:46.004]  I don't know how you lose hundreds of millions of dollars in a single quarter, but they're doing it.
[02:02:46.004 --> 02:02:47.826]  And Sears is headed for bankruptcy.
[02:02:47.826 --> 02:02:49.287]  They're going to zero.
[02:02:49.287 --> 02:02:56.513]  So the biggest, most powerful retailers all across the country, the limited, just came out within the past few days.
[02:02:56.513 --> 02:02:59.255]  They said, we're shutting down all our stores.
[02:02:59.255 --> 02:03:01.616]  So we're not going to have any stores at all anymore.
[02:03:01.616 --> 02:03:03.198]  They're still going to have an online presence.
[02:03:03.598 --> 02:03:05.700]  Yeah, Sears just sold off Craftsman Tools.
[02:03:05.700 --> 02:03:08.203]  I mean, that's one of the longest standing things out there.
[02:03:08.203 --> 02:03:10.266]  So another sign of the problems that they're having at Sears.
[02:03:11.497 --> 02:03:12.298]  Oh, it definitely is.
[02:03:12.298 --> 02:03:12.898]  Because U.S.
[02:03:12.898 --> 02:03:14.499]  consumers are tapped out.
[02:03:14.499 --> 02:03:20.924]  You know, one recent survey found that 69% of all Americans have less than $1,000 in savings.
[02:03:20.924 --> 02:03:24.287]  So basically living paycheck to paycheck, two-thirds of the country.
[02:03:24.287 --> 02:03:27.790]  So consumers don't have the same kind of money to spend as they used to spend.
[02:03:27.790 --> 02:03:34.395]  We've got, you know, in recent years, there's been the economic prosperity or any type of a boom has
[02:03:34.915 --> 02:03:38.397]  Basically gone to the top 1%, maybe the top 5%.
[02:03:38.397 --> 02:03:44.159]  But for ordinary Americans, things have gotten tougher because the cost of living, Obamacare, everything else has gone up.
[02:03:44.159 --> 02:03:45.840]  Meanwhile, wages have not kept pace.
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:47.301]  So things have been tough.
[02:03:47.301 --> 02:03:51.543]  And one leading indicator of potential economic trouble is you look at the airlines.
[02:03:51.863 --> 02:03:56.746]  Delta just came out with extremely disappointing results, and Boeing.
[02:03:56.746 --> 02:04:05.873]  Boeing is laying off engineers, and they say more layoff announcements are coming for other types of workers as well, because their sales are way down, sales of aircraft.
[02:04:05.873 --> 02:04:10.556]  In fact, 53% just since 2014, just over a couple of years.
[02:04:10.556 --> 02:04:15.340]  And so what this is saying, when the economy is booming, air traffic tends to increase.
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:19.683]  But when economic conditions start to tighten up, air traffic tends to diminish.
[02:04:19.683 --> 02:04:21.304]  And that's what we're starting to see right now.
[02:04:21.704 --> 02:04:22.364]  We're good to go.
[02:04:39.429 --> 02:04:39.969]  Absolutely.
[02:04:39.969 --> 02:04:45.293]  And of course, as reported yesterday, 97% of the recovery that did happen went to the upper 1%.
[02:04:45.293 --> 02:04:47.775]  So it's really a tale of two economies.
[02:04:47.775 --> 02:04:52.018]  It's one of the reasons why the Democrats lost so many offices under President Obama.
[02:04:52.018 --> 02:04:55.901]  Thank you so much, Michael Snyder, EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[02:04:55.901 --> 02:04:56.342]  Stay with us.
[02:04:56.342 --> 02:05:00.845]  We'll be right back with Craig Richardson, and we're going to talk about the Rockefellers and climate change.
[02:05:00.845 --> 02:05:02.186]  Here's Donald Trump on Twitter today.
[02:05:02.786 --> 02:05:06.190]  What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the FBI?
[02:05:06.190 --> 02:05:09.553]  Based on the information they had, she should never have been allowed to run.
[02:05:09.553 --> 02:05:10.514]  Guilty as hell.
[02:05:10.514 --> 02:05:11.815]  They were very nice to her.
[02:05:11.815 --> 02:05:14.278]  She lost because she campaigned in the wrong states.
[02:05:14.278 --> 02:05:15.319]  No enthusiasm.
[02:05:15.319 --> 02:05:17.961]  He left out she's a lying, corrupt criminal politician.
[02:05:17.961 --> 02:05:22.026]  He also tweeted, The Unaffordable Care Act will soon be history.
[02:05:22.026 --> 02:05:22.726]  Amen.
[02:05:22.726 --> 02:05:25.109]  Now, here is Rosie O'Donnell on Twitter.
[02:05:25.936 --> 02:05:33.402]  I fully support imposing martial law, delaying the inauguration until Trump is cleared of all charges.
[02:05:33.402 --> 02:05:36.124]  All her hearsay mafia minion followers agreed.
[02:05:36.124 --> 02:05:40.208]  The only problem with that is, there are no charges to be cleared!
[02:05:40.208 --> 02:05:42.610]  Just fake news allegations that you fall for.
[02:05:42.610 --> 02:05:44.551]  Remember her side of the fence before the election?
[02:05:44.551 --> 02:05:46.113]  When they go low, we go high?
[02:05:46.113 --> 02:05:48.294]  Trump and Republicans need to accept the results?
[02:05:48.294 --> 02:05:48.995]  So much for that.
[02:05:49.215 --> 02:05:50.557]  Two things were confirmed today.
[02:05:50.557 --> 02:05:54.922]  Trump on Twitter is awesome, and Rosie O'Donnell is a hypocritical wine bag moron.
[02:05:54.922 --> 02:05:56.263]  Jabba the Hutt in the flesh.
[02:05:56.263 --> 02:05:58.366]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars.com.
[02:06:00.165 --> 02:06:05.569]  I want to encourage all of you to remember how high the stakes really are right now in the battle for freedom.
[02:06:05.569 --> 02:06:07.990]  And the information war is paramount.
[02:06:07.990 --> 02:06:19.158]  That's why it's more important than ever that you spread the word about InfoWars.com and send out the links so people can watch the free feeds and get the free podcast and download the free iPhone and Android apps at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:06:19.518 --> 02:06:24.145]  It is critical that we be able to email you when we're being cyber attacked or shut down.
[02:06:24.145 --> 02:06:28.090]  Sign up to get our email alerts at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:06:28.090 --> 02:06:32.877]  And finally, we have launched our new free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:06:32.877 --> 02:06:34.599]  You can download it on iPhone and Android.
[02:06:34.959 --> 02:06:42.425]  Once you've downloaded the free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app you can then if you choose pay $4.95 a month to get InfoWars Prime.
[02:06:42.425 --> 02:06:49.751]  We produce documentaries, special reports, live events and so much more on a daily and weekly basis just for Prime members.
[02:06:49.751 --> 02:06:54.515]  We also have daily specials sometimes as much as 50% off for members of InfoWars Prime.
[02:06:54.515 --> 02:06:59.019]  InfoWars has come a long way and InfoWars Prime is just one more weapon in the fire
[02:06:59.780 --> 02:07:01.662]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:07:01.662 --> 02:07:03.684]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:07:03.684 --> 02:07:06.588]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:07:06.588 --> 02:07:12.655]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:07:12.655 --> 02:07:20.043]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[02:07:20.163 --> 02:07:21.825]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:07:21.825 --> 02:07:29.374]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:07:29.374 --> 02:07:37.404]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:07:37.404 --> 02:07:38.366]  The general public doesn't.
[02:07:39.586 --> 02:07:41.967]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:07:41.967 --> 02:07:47.088]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:07:47.088 --> 02:07:53.790]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:07:53.790 --> 02:07:57.891]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:08:10.669 --> 02:08:22.993]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:22.993 --> 02:08:29.296]  I'm David Knight and we're going to be talking to Craig Richardson with Energy and Environment Legal Institute.
[02:08:29.296 --> 02:08:32.857]  And let me tell you one of the reasons that we wanted to talk to Mr. Richardson.
[02:08:33.962 --> 02:08:49.173]  Of course, we want to talk to him about what's coming up with the Trump administration, with the EPA, because they have been at the forefront of shutting down our energy, but also increasing the regulatory burden in a very unprecedented, very unconstitutional way.
[02:08:49.873 --> 02:09:01.983]  During the Barack Obama administration, and they have been at the forefront these last days, this explosion of regulations, this explosion of chains that Obama is trying to put on the American people.
[02:09:01.983 --> 02:09:03.784]  They have been at the forefront of this.
[02:09:03.784 --> 02:09:11.630]  Every day this week, they have come after another major automobile manufacturer, trying to shut them down because they sell diesel engines.
[02:09:11.630 --> 02:09:14.132]  And it's not just about diesel engines, folks.
[02:09:14.132 --> 02:09:15.734]  It's not about fine particulate matter.
[02:09:16.594 --> 02:09:38.440]  They've had their own cheating test that we caught them in in North Carolina, where they were testing on human beings and cheating on those tests, trying to show how dangerous fine particulate matter was, so they could shut down coal, so they could shut down diesels, because those are very efficient competitors to the energy providers that they want to subsidize, their crony capitalist friends.
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:39.400]  And so in light of that,
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:51.227]  I wanted to get him on because New American was talking about this new report, which actually comes from his organization, Energy and Environment Legal Institute, a new report that exposes the Rockefeller dynasty's role in the climate scam.
[02:09:51.227 --> 02:09:54.168]  And this is how New American begins their article.
[02:09:54.168 --> 02:10:06.976]  They say, an unfathomably wealthy banking and oil dynasty has been hijacking governments, media organs, universities, non-profits, other power centers to expand its control over the economy and the energy sector in particular.
[02:10:07.416 --> 02:10:10.579]  According to a recently released investigation by a watchdog group.
[02:10:27.433 --> 02:10:32.775]  He has participated in numerous issue campaigns, including anti-tax and deregulation initiatives.
[02:10:32.775 --> 02:10:35.695]  The website is eelegal.org.
[02:10:35.695 --> 02:10:40.017]  And of course, hopefully we are going to see some deregulation from the EPA.
[02:10:40.017 --> 02:10:43.918]  Let's talk about first, what do you think is going to happen
[02:10:44.458 --> 02:11:00.702]  With the new head of the EPA, we have the Attorney General from Oklahoma, who has been at the forefront of opposing over-aggressive regulation from the EPA, and he's proud of that, and he's the person that Donald Trump has selected to be the head of the EPA.
[02:11:00.702 --> 02:11:05.644]  Tell us, Mr. Richardson, what are your expectations as we see moving forward?
[02:11:05.644 --> 02:11:10.545]  Do you think he's going to roll back some of these things that are being put on us at the last minute by Barack Obama?
[02:11:11.408 --> 02:11:12.329]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:11:12.329 --> 02:11:17.992]  I don't think you could have hand-picked a better person than Attorney General Scott Pruitt for many reasons.
[02:11:17.992 --> 02:11:23.876]  For those who don't know, he is Attorney General from Oklahoma, a very important energy-producing state.
[02:11:23.876 --> 02:11:34.984]  He was one of the 26 or 27 Attorney Generals that sued the federal government over the Clean Power Plan, or as a colleague of mine refers to it, the Creating Poverty Plan.
[02:11:34.984 --> 02:11:35.284]  Yes.
[02:11:35.284 --> 02:11:36.645]  So, he understands that.
[02:11:36.645 --> 02:11:40.948]  Philosophically, he is a Federalist, meaning he understands that this
[02:11:41.868 --> 02:11:53.354]  Overreach by the federal government over the last 40, 50 years, and most particularly the last eight, is not healthy for the economy and also not healthy for the environment.
[02:11:53.354 --> 02:11:55.195]  So here's a guy who understands it all.
[02:11:55.195 --> 02:11:56.695]  He's going to come in.
[02:11:56.695 --> 02:12:03.479]  I know many of the people that he's put on the transition team itself, and as the old expression goes, personnel is policy.
[02:12:04.159 --> 02:12:10.584]  So the people he's surrounded with, Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute is leading the transition team.
[02:12:10.584 --> 02:12:13.826]  A great group, libertarian, right of center.
[02:12:13.826 --> 02:12:19.631]  Myron's been working on this kinds of issues for his whole career and other people he brings in around.
[02:12:20.191 --> 02:12:25.773]  To help that transition out really are very stalwart free market people.
[02:12:25.773 --> 02:12:27.374]  So I expect great changes.
[02:12:27.374 --> 02:12:35.577]  I saw in your lead up this president going out has been more prolific than any other I can ever remember in history.
[02:12:35.577 --> 02:12:39.239]  I think somebody needs to remind him that his side lost and it's time for him to pack up and go.
[02:12:39.699 --> 02:12:48.187]  Well, you know, even before he won the very first time, he came out as he was campaigning and saying, you can build a coal plant, but we're going to bankrupt you if you do.
[02:12:48.187 --> 02:12:59.037]  And now they're going through, after coming close to bankrupting the coal industry during his eight years, in his final days, it looks like they're trying to bankrupt one car company after the other for the sin
[02:12:59.677 --> 02:13:06.620]  ...of creating an internal combustion engine because they can't do enough to subsidize the battery-run cars.
[02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:08.441]  People don't want to buy the electric cars.
[02:13:08.441 --> 02:13:09.202]  They're not there yet.
[02:13:09.202 --> 02:13:10.542]  The technology is not there yet.
[02:13:10.542 --> 02:13:12.623]  It's not as durable as these other cars.
[02:13:12.623 --> 02:13:25.350]  They want something that is planned obsolescence, I believe, so that they can wean us off of private car ownership and put us into another type of control grid that goes back to their Agenda 2030 and Agenda 21 sustainability issues.
[02:13:28.211 --> 02:13:37.836]  But that's what we've seen from this administration is bankrupting entire industries and using the EPA as a massive tool of social engineering.
[02:13:37.836 --> 02:13:38.937]  And I agree with you.
[02:13:38.937 --> 02:13:42.639]  I think that Pruitt is one of the best picks that Donald Trump has made.
[02:13:42.639 --> 02:13:47.061]  I'm really hoping that we're going to see some massive changes at the EPA.
[02:13:47.061 --> 02:13:54.245]  It really needs to be totally changed in terms of that corporate culture that they've got going there.
[02:13:55.219 --> 02:13:56.519]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:56.519 --> 02:14:07.903]  And there's no question in some of our Freedom of Information Work Act that we did show that this administration, meaning the one that's about to leave, thank God, literally came in there on day one.
[02:14:07.903 --> 02:14:12.785]  I mean, we found documents going back to the same time period eight years ago, leading up into the transition.
[02:14:12.785 --> 02:14:17.106]  But they had that game plan in place, what ultimately became the Clean Power Plan.
[02:14:17.106 --> 02:14:18.527]  They were going to come in.
[02:14:18.527 --> 02:14:19.587]  They had already identified
[02:14:20.287 --> 02:14:23.028]  Uh, coal-fired power plants that they were going to shut down.
[02:14:23.028 --> 02:14:29.389]  They came in with a plan and, you know, mentioned it's all part of the UN's effort as well at the international level, but that's essentially the plan.
[02:14:29.389 --> 02:14:44.431]  The plan was to shut down coal first, open up the renewable energy markets, push that all to their green corporate friends and like Tom Steyer who already set up in there, and as well as just trying to completely control how much energy is used by the American public.
[02:14:44.431 --> 02:14:48.492]  And as we've seen too, after eight years, completely devastating the energy
[02:14:49.072 --> 02:14:49.573]  We're good to go.
[02:15:15.712 --> 02:15:18.174]  And I don't think it's even an environmental issue if you look at this.
[02:15:18.174 --> 02:15:26.019]  If you look at coal, they've got coal-powered plants that they could make clean, but they wanted to shut it down because they wanted to move us in a different direction.
[02:15:26.019 --> 02:15:45.252]  And this is very important for people to understand how the Rockefellers are behind this and how this is a move from different globalist elites to shut down one industry and move things over to another industry to use this as a justification for centralized globalization, centralized global control.
[02:15:45.912 --> 02:15:51.238]  But I think it's also an important story, Craig, about what happens to individuals.
[02:15:51.238 --> 02:15:58.627]  We saw what happened to this guy who had eight acres in Montana, and he had a pond that he put on his land.
[02:16:00.589 --> 02:16:01.029]  We're good to go.
[02:16:19.398 --> 02:16:22.181]  This is the kind of oppression that the EPA does.
[02:16:22.181 --> 02:16:37.116]  And Craig, as you know, as this was going on, they're polluting in a massive way this, the, I think it was the Aname River that went through three different states because they went in, they were warned by a veteran engineer that what they were doing at one of these mines was going to explode.
[02:16:37.116 --> 02:16:39.919]  And he even said before they did it, he said, they want to do this.
[02:16:40.359 --> 02:16:52.784]  Because they want to create a super fund, and then they went ahead and did it, and it turned out exactly the way that retired engineer pointed out, and they polluted the water over three states and an Indian reservation, and with heavy metal.
[02:16:52.784 --> 02:17:02.308]  So these are the same people saying we're protecting the environment, persecuting this small individual on his eight acres, and then polluting a river over three states and an Indian reservation.
[02:17:03.089 --> 02:17:06.191]  Yeah, and I think you have to nail the head because this has nothing to do with the environment.
[02:17:06.191 --> 02:17:06.772]  Let's face it.
[02:17:06.772 --> 02:17:15.078]  I mean, one of the things I'm very offended by, I come from New England with a long family history in conservation and using the land for purposes.
[02:17:15.078 --> 02:17:20.402]  A good friend of mine, Debbie, is a rancher and fifth generation rancher in California, and they're doing the same thing with her.
[02:17:20.402 --> 02:17:20.762]  She actually
[02:17:21.082 --> 02:17:22.343]  Ended up running for Congress.
[02:17:22.343 --> 02:17:23.424]  She couldn't take it anymore.
[02:17:23.424 --> 02:17:27.807]  I mean, these have been stewards of their land and raising cattle and doing everything else.
[02:17:27.807 --> 02:17:35.012]  And as she always points out, I can't think of anybody more who's more into their own property and protecting it than we are.
[02:17:35.012 --> 02:17:39.075]  And why is this unelected group of people out of Washington coming in here and telling us what to do?
[02:17:39.075 --> 02:17:42.438]  And all those horror stories you pointed out are exactly right.
[02:17:42.438 --> 02:17:46.541]  Because the point is, in the end, they're not about trying to make the environment better.
[02:17:46.881 --> 02:17:49.122]  They're not about clean water and everything else.
[02:17:49.122 --> 02:17:51.182]  It's about centralized control.
[02:17:51.182 --> 02:17:55.864]  It's about shifting industries from one to another like we discussed.
[02:17:55.864 --> 02:18:06.587]  The irony is you get a guy like Tom Steyer who spends millions of dollars on elections trying to shut down coal-fired power plants, yet here's a guy who made money in coal-fired power plants.
[02:18:06.587 --> 02:18:12.449]  His old hedge funds still do, citing them overseas, so he's still making money on it.
[02:18:12.449 --> 02:18:13.189]  George Soros,
[02:18:13.889 --> 02:18:19.094]  Once the coal stocks went down to near zero, went running around buying up all the assets.
[02:18:19.094 --> 02:18:21.616]  So this isn't about trying to clean up the environment.
[02:18:21.616 --> 02:18:30.123]  This is about trying to control the asset, control the resources, and then also prop up this sort of fake green energy industry.
[02:18:30.123 --> 02:18:35.268]  That's what this renewable energy plans are all about, where you have these unrealistic levels of attainment.
[02:18:35.268 --> 02:18:38.611]  Because Al Gore and everybody else is already knee-deep in that industry already.
[02:18:39.051 --> 02:18:43.512]  Yeah, you're talking about Soros and Al Gore, but also Elon Musk.
[02:18:43.512 --> 02:18:51.974]  This is a guy, LA Times pointed out, has gotten over four billion dollars of government subsidies to build factories, subsidization of the cars that he sells.
[02:18:51.974 --> 02:19:02.337]  Of course, the cars that you buy with internal combustion engines, whether the gasoline or diesel, they have a higher price because that money is going to be subsidizing cars that people buy from Tesla.
[02:19:02.337 --> 02:19:06.278]  And yet, at the same time, they just put a four billion dollar charge against
[02:19:06.818 --> 02:19:07.840]  I don't
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:23.501]  We're good to go.
[02:19:47.018 --> 02:19:50.690]  Breakdown for us how the Rockefellers are behind this.
[02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:51.513]  So stay with us.

[02:22:02.583 --> 02:22:05.326]  I absolutely love One World Whey.
[02:22:05.326 --> 02:22:10.392]  It was about five years ago when a trainer told me it was the end all of protein powders.
[02:22:10.392 --> 02:22:13.735]  One day when I ran out, I decided to try other brands.
[02:22:13.735 --> 02:22:16.718]  I spent eight months and could not find a replacement.
[02:22:16.718 --> 02:22:19.922]  I went through tons of brands, types, and flavors, and almost all
[02:22:20.202 --> 02:22:23.183]  All of them tasted unnatural and not pleasant.
[02:22:23.183 --> 02:22:27.364]  When it all boiled down, I came right back to One World Way.
[02:22:27.364 --> 02:22:32.925]  I buy the cost-effective five-pound container and my family craves their One World Way, too.

[02:24:03.389 --> 02:24:19.138]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:19.138 --> 02:24:24.521]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Craig Richardson with Energy and Environment Legal.
[02:24:24.521 --> 02:24:26.362]  That's E-E-Legal dot org.
[02:24:27.082 --> 02:24:36.248]  We talked in the last segment about how he mentioned how George Soros went in and bought coal stocks after Barack Obama collapsed that industry.
[02:24:36.248 --> 02:24:45.293]  Also, Elon Musk is getting massive subsidies at your expense if you buy a car that isn't an electric car, that he gets those carbon credits.
[02:24:45.293 --> 02:24:51.997]  But there's another crony capitalist that's at the bottom of all this, and that's what I wanted Craig to break down for us in this segment here.
[02:24:51.997 --> 02:24:56.240]  That's a report that came from his organization, The Rockefeller Way.
[02:24:57.020 --> 02:25:03.103]  The family's covert climate change plan, because we need to understand what's really behind all this.
[02:25:03.103 --> 02:25:05.684]  Break that down for us, Craig.
[02:25:05.684 --> 02:25:08.605]  What is the Rockefellers' involvement in this?
[02:25:08.605 --> 02:25:10.746]  Well, you know, dealing with the Rockefellers is a little hard.
[02:25:10.746 --> 02:25:13.668]  There was an expression from history you probably recall.
[02:25:13.668 --> 02:25:17.969]  During the Roman Empire, they would say, all roads lead to Rome.
[02:25:17.969 --> 02:25:23.032]  Well, in the United States, really over the last 100 years, when you're dealing with any major
[02:25:23.692 --> 02:25:31.436]  Policy, whether it's health or pharmaceuticals or environment or energy, you can say that all roads lead to Rockefeller Plaza.
[02:25:31.436 --> 02:25:35.018]  In some shape, way or form, these people have been involved.
[02:25:35.018 --> 02:25:35.878]  Early on, J.D.
[02:25:35.878 --> 02:25:41.061]  Rockefeller got involved with social movements because everybody knew what a, you know, an SOB he was.
[02:25:41.061 --> 02:25:45.823]  So he had a PR guy essentially said, you need to start giving more philanthropy.
[02:25:45.823 --> 02:25:46.584]  And his other
[02:25:47.404 --> 02:25:56.090]  Guys as well did the same thing, but what they learned very quickly early on was that you could use those social movements as a way to open up markets for yourself, to drive policy.
[02:25:56.090 --> 02:26:11.201]  There isn't any better example than to look at the United Nations, and if you scratch the surface there, you realize that it was the Rockefellers themselves that donated the land in Manhattan for this now international organization that gave them an international reach.
[02:26:11.201 --> 02:26:13.503]  All under the guise of doing good for the world, right?
[02:26:14.023 --> 02:26:16.927]  So this is basically their ammo for a long time.
[02:26:16.927 --> 02:26:22.633]  If you fast forward to the climate change, they were one of the early funders in the 80s.
[02:26:22.633 --> 02:26:29.942]  As you recall, at that time, it was called global warming, which was not to be confused with global cooling, which was about 10 years earlier.
[02:26:30.929 --> 02:26:33.312]  But in the 80s, they started pushing global warming.
[02:26:33.312 --> 02:26:41.419]  And then obviously, after 18 years of a pause, as they like to refer to it, they suddenly had to change gears and call it climate change, which is where we are now.
[02:26:41.419 --> 02:26:43.241]  So they got in early, they provided funding.
[02:26:43.241 --> 02:26:51.909]  Again, we talked a lot about the motives of what we've seen before in terms of them being able to control the markets, being able to understand which way things are going.
[02:26:51.909 --> 02:26:54.632]  But most specifically through, and the report covers this,
[02:26:55.595 --> 02:27:20.864]  Through our Freedom of Information Act request, we discovered that back in a couple years ago, maybe four years ago, the Rockefeller Family Fund, which is one of their various social engineering groups, their foundations, held a meeting where they came up with a strategy of how they were going to essentially go after, starting with Exxon Mobil.
[02:27:20.864 --> 02:27:24.265]  And ironically, as those who may know, Exxon Mobil were two of the largest
[02:27:24.885 --> 02:27:27.227]  Uh, standard oil companies that got broken up.
[02:27:27.227 --> 02:27:28.087]  One was New Jersey.
[02:27:28.087 --> 02:27:29.528]  One was New York.
[02:27:29.528 --> 02:27:36.913]  Um, so they decided they would try to do them, uh, go after them similar to the way that the tobacco industry was attacked in the 90s.
[02:27:36.913 --> 02:27:40.176]  And in that meeting, they came up with a couple of strategy items.
[02:27:40.176 --> 02:27:43.978]  Number one, they were going to fund a chair at the Columbia School of Journalism.
[02:27:43.978 --> 02:27:44.939]  So they found this guy.
[02:27:45.519 --> 02:27:47.862]  Who fit the bill in terms of being a climate activist.
[02:27:47.862 --> 02:27:50.825]  They literally funded his program out of nothing.
[02:27:50.825 --> 02:28:02.777]  And he created this through his young journalists, a investigatory report that showed Exxon knew, sort of like the tobacco guys when they said, well, they knew tobacco was addictive, but they were hiding it.
[02:28:02.777 --> 02:28:05.560]  They said that he wanted that same mantra coming out of this.
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:06.421]  Well, Exxon knew that
[02:28:07.001 --> 02:28:16.525]  All of their fossil fuels were driving the temperatures up around the world, so we're going to go after them and shut them down, and global settlements, and the lawyers obviously started licking their chops.
[02:28:16.525 --> 02:28:17.365]  So that was one.
[02:28:17.365 --> 02:28:21.707]  Get Columbia to fund that and to do a report, which they did.
[02:28:21.707 --> 02:28:31.091]  Then once the report was done, they used another group that they fund called Inside Climate News, which has a bunch of old reporters from, you know, blue chip
[02:28:32.931 --> 02:28:33.631]  We're good to go.
[02:28:58.583 --> 02:29:08.474]  Attorney General who could then use the prosecutorial powers that he has as an AG at a state level to basically go after Exxon.
[02:29:08.474 --> 02:29:15.561]  And actually not only Exxon, but what really became nefarious is they started going after groups like Competitive Enterprise Institute.
[02:29:15.561 --> 02:29:19.746]  Anybody that Exxon had donated to, they suddenly wanted to go after and shut up.
[02:29:20.572 --> 02:29:31.360]  And they didn't have to go very far because they found this activist AG in New York, Eric Schneiderman, and he took the bait, or he took the incentive.
[02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:32.440]  I wish we had more time.
[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:35.463]  We're out of time, and if you want to see, we just scratched the surface.
[02:29:35.463 --> 02:29:38.345]  Craig Richardson, President of Energy and Environment.
[02:29:38.345 --> 02:29:42.227]  If you want to see the rest of that report, you can see that at eelegal.org.
[02:29:42.227 --> 02:29:42.928]  Is that correct, Craig?
[02:29:43.568 --> 02:29:44.369]  Absolutely.
[02:29:44.369 --> 02:29:46.451]  That's a very important report to read.
[02:29:46.451 --> 02:29:50.215]  There's more information there than we could ever possibly cover on the show.
[02:29:50.215 --> 02:29:51.736]  Go there and get that information.
[02:29:51.736 --> 02:29:52.757]  Thank you so much, Craig.
[02:29:52.757 --> 02:29:53.718]  Thanks for having me.
[02:30:00.279 --> 02:30:11.847]  Yesterday, the Senate took the first step towards repealing the Affordable Care Act with a 51-48 vote on a new budget blueprint that would open the doors to gut and rid ourselves of the disaster that is Obamacare without allowing Democrats to filibuster.
[02:30:11.847 --> 02:30:24.655]  Liberal tears flowed heavy as the Senate had to be called in order every time a Democrat voted no, with a nice lecture to go with it, forcing the providing officer, Senator Cory Gardner, to slam his gavel and scold the Democrats, repeating ad nauseam, debate is not allowed during a vote.
[02:30:24.775 --> 02:30:27.856]  Now today, the vote moves on to the House, where we have had similar results.
[02:30:27.856 --> 02:30:38.001]  The debate has been heated, with Democrats speaking past their time, bringing in large, blown-up photos of children to win sympathy points, and trying to argue that Republicans are ending healthcare, like before the Affordable Care Act, right?
[02:30:38.001 --> 02:30:50.247]  Senator Hakeem Jeffries claims that voting against the Affordable Care Act sets up Americans to be screwed by big wigs and fat cats in the healthcare industry, ignoring the fact that this is what the Affordable Care Act did, creating healthcare monopolies in some regions.
[02:30:50.407 --> 02:30:56.294]  He also said that Republicans had no plan, to which Republicans responded by showing the many plans they brought to the debate floor.
[02:30:56.294 --> 02:31:00.059]  This is Owen Troyer, and I've got jugs of liberal tears here.
[02:31:00.059 --> 02:31:03.283]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:31:03.283 --> 02:31:04.965]  Deep Cleanse by Infowarslife.com
[02:31:05.606 --> 02:31:12.614]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocolloidal zeolites and organic ingredients that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.

[02:31:17.940 --> 02:31:26.930]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites and others, Deep Cleanze doesn't hold back.
[02:31:27.350 --> 02:31:36.237]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[02:31:36.237 --> 02:31:43.322]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary Spike G-Rex herbal processing technique.
[02:31:43.322 --> 02:31:48.706]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs, backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best
[02:31:48.806 --> 02:31:56.889]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:32:15.356 --> 02:32:20.399]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:32:20.399 --> 02:32:22.960]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:24.681]  It helps detoxify.
[02:32:24.681 --> 02:32:27.562]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:32:27.562 --> 02:32:32.345]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:32:32.345 --> 02:32:38.608]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:32:38.608 --> 02:32:43.930]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:32:43.930 --> 02:32:44.691]  I'm taking it now.
[02:32:45.011 --> 02:32:45.652]  Every day.
[02:32:45.652 --> 02:32:46.634]  This is so key.
[02:32:46.634 --> 02:32:49.198]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[02:32:49.198 --> 02:32:50.961]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[02:32:50.961 --> 02:32:53.185]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.

[02:33:15.613 --> 02:33:18.895]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:18.895 --> 02:33:22.398]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm David Knight.
[02:33:23.268 --> 02:33:26.790]  So your computer breaks, and you take it to get it fixed.
[02:33:26.790 --> 02:33:37.678]  Do you know that the government is using tech company employees as paid informants to spy on you when you take your computer there?
[02:33:37.678 --> 02:33:40.760]  Of course, they're always looking.
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:42.201]  This is the world that we live in.
[02:33:42.201 --> 02:33:50.407]  Who would have thought that we would become far, far worse than the East German Stasi police in this country?
[02:33:50.407 --> 02:33:51.788]  And of course, that was an analogy
[02:33:52.549 --> 02:33:57.650]  Not just coming from me, that's coming from William Binney, the former technical head of the NSA.
[02:33:57.650 --> 02:34:13.595]  And he talked about how he spent his entire career watching the police and surveillance states in the Soviet Union, in East Germany, and said that what we have here is far more extensive than the Stasi ever was.
[02:34:13.595 --> 02:34:16.775]  We've got a report by Joe Biggs that's coming up in just one moment.
[02:34:16.775 --> 02:34:18.696]  Before I throw to that report, I want to remind you
[02:34:19.341 --> 02:34:27.905]  That we have put a lot of items on sale at Infowarslife.com to help you start the new year right, to make your body great again.

[02:35:08.230 --> 02:35:12.932]  Subsidy, our supplement that we have here, subsidy, my favorite supplement that we have here.
[02:35:12.932 --> 02:35:32.459]  That is, as I point out many times, one of the things that I feel right away, but as I pointed out, when I get out of my habit of taking supplements on a daily basis, as I do Monday through Friday, on weekends, or as I take a vacation over the holidays, that's when I really noticed it at the end of this year, when it's like, wow, you know, I really don't have the energy or the focus or the concentration.
[02:35:33.019 --> 02:35:35.219]  I do when I'm taking this stuff on a daily basis.
[02:35:35.219 --> 02:35:38.980]  That's why it's important for you to set up a habit.
[02:35:38.980 --> 02:35:43.921]  And this is a good time for you to create new, positive, healthy habits.
[02:35:43.921 --> 02:35:47.542]  And one of the ways that you can do that is to set yourself up for Autoship.
[02:35:47.542 --> 02:35:53.943]  Decide what supplements you want to take on a regular basis, what works for you, what you need to do for yourself.
[02:35:53.943 --> 02:35:58.704]  You can read the reviews at InfoWarsLife.com and you can sign up for Autoship and you can get
[02:35:59.324 --> 02:36:02.728]  Guaranteed delivery on all these items and make sure they never run out of stock.
[02:36:02.728 --> 02:36:04.550]  We just ran out of stock on DNA Force.
[02:36:04.550 --> 02:36:06.291]  We were out for over a month.
[02:36:06.291 --> 02:36:08.514]  We've gotten that back in with an emergency shipment.
[02:36:08.514 --> 02:36:11.296]  Once that's out, it may be out for months.
[02:36:11.296 --> 02:36:14.119]  But we've put it in for people, even people who are not on auto ship.
[02:36:14.119 --> 02:36:19.665]  You can get that for 10% discount as a thank you and because it's been out of stock for a while.
[02:36:20.626 --> 02:36:24.629]  But you can always get a 10% discount if you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:36:24.629 --> 02:36:34.757]  And if you have more than $50 on your, you pick the interval that you want, the products that you want shipped to you, and if that shipment is more than $50, you'll even get it with free shipping.
[02:36:34.757 --> 02:36:41.262]  Make sure that you never run out of the items that you want to make a habit in your daily life.
[02:36:41.262 --> 02:36:43.023]  Let's go to this report now from Joe Biggs.
[02:36:43.023 --> 02:36:47.427]  The government is using tech company employees as paid informants.
[02:36:49.155 --> 02:36:52.159]  What's going on everybody this is Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:36:52.159 --> 02:36:56.464]  Now today I want to cover an article that I saw from TechDirt.com.
[02:36:56.464 --> 02:37:05.235]  Now in this article it says that the FBI is apparently paying Geek Squad members to dig around people's computers for evidence of criminal activity.
[02:37:05.916 --> 02:37:10.640]  So when I give you my computer, you're not supposed to be just going through my computer.
[02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:14.022]  You're supposed to be trying to fix the issues at hand.
[02:37:14.022 --> 02:37:23.750]  Now, if you do stumble across something accidentally, say child pornography, which is where this article does end up going, then they're supposed to notify proper authorities.
[02:37:23.750 --> 02:37:28.133]  But you're not supposed to be getting a paycheck from the FBI for doing that.
[02:37:28.133 --> 02:37:31.196]  And that's an issue that's happening here with this article.
[02:37:32.034 --> 02:37:53.368]  Now according to court records, Geek Squad technician John Trey Westfall was an FBI informant and reported he accidentally located on Wright and Myers, I guess this is the guy who submitted his computer in to be looked at, an image of a fully nude prepubescent female on her hands and knees on a bed, fully nude with a choker around her neck.
[02:37:54.769 --> 02:38:05.677]  This guy was an FBI informant who notified another man who was an FBI informant, who alerted a colleague, Randall Ratliff, who was another FBI informant.
[02:38:05.677 --> 02:38:16.446]  And then eventually it got to the FBI, and this guy was apparently tied to a series of illicit pictures called the Jenny Shots.
[02:38:16.446 --> 02:38:20.809]  Agent Tracy Riley seized that hard drive and submitted it into the FBI.
[02:38:21.846 --> 02:38:24.049]  Now, it's not that big of a deal.
[02:38:24.049 --> 02:38:36.807]  Like I said before, it is a customary practice by people who work in computer electronic device repair that if they stumble across child pornography that they are supposed to
[02:38:38.075 --> 02:38:38.455]  I think?
[02:38:55.430 --> 02:39:13.982]  Houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable search and seizures shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.
[02:39:13.982 --> 02:39:21.207]  The ultimate goal of this provision is to protect people's right to privacy and freedom for arbitrary governmental intrusions.
[02:39:22.998 --> 02:39:37.289]  Now, setting aside the issue of whether the search of Rattenheimer's computer constituted an illegal search by private individuals acting as government agents, the FBI undertook a series of dishonest measures in hopes of building a case.
[02:39:37.289 --> 02:39:46.597]  Now, according to James Z. Redditt, Rattenheimer's San Clemente-based defense lawyer, Redditt says agents conducted two additional searches of the computer without obtaining
[02:39:47.037 --> 02:39:58.667]  So that's the issue is that instead of going through the law and using it the proper way and getting that warrant and providing enough evidence to prove that that warrant is needed to seize and go through that information, they went to Best Buy employee and said,
[02:40:14.099 --> 02:40:16.101]  Here's a check for 500 bucks.
[02:40:16.101 --> 02:40:17.622]  Tell us what you see.
[02:40:17.622 --> 02:40:24.828]  Is it good that they stopped child pornography from getting out there and they went after a guy who was tied to something like that?
[02:40:24.828 --> 02:40:28.371]  Yes, that is good that that happened.
[02:40:28.371 --> 02:40:33.735]  But it's the way that it's happening and the way that it never just stops and starts at that one spot.
[02:40:33.735 --> 02:40:35.837]  It eventually begins to grow.
[02:40:35.837 --> 02:40:38.239]  It's like they say, you give them an inch, they take a mile.
[02:40:38.239 --> 02:40:39.360]  You give the federal government
[02:40:40.186 --> 02:40:49.773]  Look what Edward Snowden brought to the forefront with his revelations in The Guardian showing how Verizon was helping the U.S.
[02:40:49.773 --> 02:40:53.255]  government spy on its users.
[02:40:53.255 --> 02:41:02.982]  Look at General Petraeus talking about how in the future, you know, your washing machine or your microwave or refrigerator will be listening to your conversations.
[02:41:02.982 --> 02:41:06.825]  We now have a new thing by Amazon called Alexa.
[02:41:07.245 --> 02:41:10.688]  That is a device that sits in your room and can listen to you.
[02:41:10.688 --> 02:41:22.077]  There has to be a line drawn in the sand when it comes to what these tech companies can do as far as their involvement with helping the government spy on its citizens.
[02:41:22.077 --> 02:41:30.504]  Like I said, we have a Fourth Amendment that clearly states that without a warrant or without reasonable suspicion, you cannot illegally seize
[02:41:31.064 --> 02:41:34.926]  Or search or go through any of my property, that being my home.
[02:41:34.926 --> 02:41:40.830]  You can't go through my car and you can't go through my laptop computer because you think something.
[02:41:40.830 --> 02:41:45.113]  You actually have to have some kind of evidence to allow that to happen.
[02:41:45.113 --> 02:41:55.079]  And we've seen how Dell is apparently having their computers intercepted by the NSA so they can install malware to spy on more people.
[02:41:55.079 --> 02:41:58.241]  More and more, it looks like we're living in a scene from the book of 1984.
[02:42:00.442 --> 02:42:09.973]  Hopefully on January 20th, President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States and he will help us straighten this up.
[02:42:09.973 --> 02:42:12.355]  This has been Joe Biggs with InfoWars.com.
[02:42:20.144 --> 02:42:28.808]  Senator Sessions, as he becomes Attorney General, and I think he will pass that with flying colors, but we'll have to see if he passes the other test.
[02:42:28.808 --> 02:42:30.729]  Will he respect the Fourth Amendment?
[02:42:30.729 --> 02:42:33.530]  Will he roll back these structures that have been put in place?
[02:42:33.530 --> 02:42:37.592]  And of course, as Rand Paul pointed out, the FISA Court has become the rubber stamp for this.
[02:42:37.592 --> 02:42:43.834]  They go in and they say that they're going to a court to get a search warrant, but they go in and get a search warrant for Mr. and Mrs. Verizon.
[02:42:43.834 --> 02:42:45.215]  That's not what the Fourth Amendment is about.
[02:42:45.762 --> 02:42:47.223]  The Fourth Amendment makes it very clear.
[02:42:47.223 --> 02:42:52.747]  You're coming in to get information about a particular person at a particular place.
[02:42:52.747 --> 02:42:55.709]  You're looking for something in particular.
[02:42:55.709 --> 02:42:57.630]  All of those were very, very particular about that.
[02:42:57.630 --> 02:42:59.471]  But of course, they've used FISA.
[02:42:59.471 --> 02:43:07.957]  FISA was created, interestingly enough, because we had the phone companies like AT&T spying back in the 1970s for the NSA and the CIA on American people.
[02:43:08.703 --> 02:43:11.864]  And that was exposed by the Church Committee hearings, by the Pike Committee hearings.
[02:43:11.864 --> 02:43:13.444]  That was why they created FISA.
[02:43:13.444 --> 02:43:20.146]  Yet now they use that thing that was to stop them from doing that to enable them to do it.
[02:43:20.146 --> 02:43:21.826]  As a beard to enable them to do it.
[02:43:21.826 --> 02:43:23.187]  The same way they're using the Constitution.
[02:43:23.187 --> 02:43:26.207]  The Constitution was put in place to keep them from abusing our rights.
[02:43:26.207 --> 02:43:32.209]  Now they take an oath to the Constitution and they say, well I've got the authority of office now because I took an oath to a Constitution.
[02:43:32.816 --> 02:43:35.679]  And they ignore the Constitution, just like they ignore the FISA Act.
[02:43:35.679 --> 02:43:39.482]  And of course, a key part of this is the third-party involvement.
[02:43:39.482 --> 02:43:51.813]  That's why they worked so hard with CISPA twice, with ACTA, with PIPA, and then they got CISA finally passed through, so that you can't sue third parties for turning over information about you.
[02:43:52.489 --> 02:43:56.070]  One of the other fights we're going to have here, of course, is the ethics fight.
[02:43:56.070 --> 02:44:00.531]  And there's going to be this push going back and forth about conflict of interest.
[02:44:00.531 --> 02:44:04.872]  That's going to be a continuing fight that the left is going to use against Donald Trump.
[02:44:04.872 --> 02:44:12.274]  We had Representative Jason Chaffetz, the head of the House Oversight Committee, criticize the director of the Federal Office of Government Ethics.
[02:44:12.714 --> 02:44:16.855]  Yesterday, over his criticism of Trump's plan to address conflict of interest.
[02:44:16.855 --> 02:44:26.458]  And quite frankly, I thought that Trump went way beyond what was necessary, what was required, both legally and ethically, to handle his very complex businesses.
[02:44:26.458 --> 02:44:31.440]  But this is what Chaffetz says about the comments from the Office of Government Ethics.
[02:44:32.341 --> 02:44:34.561]  This individual seems to be acting prematurely at best.
[02:44:34.561 --> 02:44:38.822]  He's rendering opinions publicly that really cause you to scratch your head.
[02:44:38.822 --> 02:44:42.403]  We need the Office of Government Ethics to act ethically.
[02:44:42.403 --> 02:44:43.883]  Ironically, that's not what they're doing.
[02:44:43.883 --> 02:44:48.864]  Now, this guy that came out and criticized Donald Trump's plan is an appointee of guess who?
[02:44:48.864 --> 02:44:49.685]  Barack Obama.
[02:44:49.685 --> 02:44:51.585]  See, it's all back to politics.
[02:44:51.585 --> 02:44:55.826]  He's been a frequent critic of the incoming administration's ethics plans, peaking
[02:44:56.506 --> 02:45:01.788]  Wednesday, when he called Trump's newly unveiled conflicts of interest policy meaningless.
[02:45:01.788 --> 02:45:04.849]  Now this is from Politico, even, that's coming out.
[02:45:04.849 --> 02:45:09.131]  The plan does not comport, he said, with the tradition of our presidents over the last 40 years.
[02:45:09.131 --> 02:45:09.391]  Really?
[02:45:09.391 --> 02:45:11.732]  Well, you know, we have a very long tradition.
[02:45:11.732 --> 02:45:18.355]  It goes back to people like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who kept their businesses, who didn't have to sell them because we decided at that time.
[02:45:18.976 --> 02:45:26.965]  That we didn't want to simply have people who were going to be professional politicians, who were going to remain in Washington and be lobbyists.
[02:45:26.965 --> 02:45:29.128]  And that's another part of what Donald Trump has done.
[02:45:29.128 --> 02:45:36.015]  And yet we have, he came up with his ethics plan to say we're going to ban lobbying from people who have been in the government.
[02:45:36.656 --> 02:45:38.697]  For not one year, but for five years.
[02:45:38.697 --> 02:45:40.879]  And so immediately Paul Ryan speaks out on that.
[02:45:40.879 --> 02:45:42.320]  He doesn't like that idea.
[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:44.581]  He's one of the guys in charge of the swamp.
[02:45:44.581 --> 02:45:45.862]  He doesn't want it drained.
[02:45:45.862 --> 02:45:48.944]  He said this proposal, he said, is dangerous.
[02:45:48.944 --> 02:45:51.665]  He said there are unforeseen circumstances in this.
[02:45:51.665 --> 02:45:53.307]  And listen to the example that he gives.
[02:45:53.307 --> 02:45:53.607]  He says,
[02:45:54.215 --> 02:45:57.118]  What if he wanted to become an advocate for the Cancer Society?
[02:45:57.118 --> 02:45:58.680]  Then you couldn't do that under Donald Trump.
[02:45:58.680 --> 02:46:05.448]  And it's like, oh yeah, that's what these guys have been doing after they leave the Senate and the House and go to K Street.
[02:46:05.448 --> 02:46:07.811]  They've been searching for a cure for cancer.
[02:46:10.370 --> 02:46:11.491]  I don't think so.
[02:46:11.491 --> 02:46:13.191]  And then he goes on to say this.
[02:46:13.191 --> 02:46:16.172]  I don't think we should tell men and women that we want a citizen legislature.
[02:46:16.172 --> 02:46:19.314]  Take time out of your private life, come and serve, and then go back into private life.
[02:46:19.314 --> 02:46:22.255]  And you can't get engaged in civics.
[02:46:22.255 --> 02:46:22.975]  Okay?
[02:46:22.975 --> 02:46:28.877]  Because to him, civics and government means lobbying for cash.
[02:46:28.877 --> 02:46:31.198]  That's what is really happening in Washington.
[02:46:31.198 --> 02:46:33.539]  It's absolutely amazing when we see that.
[02:46:33.539 --> 02:46:35.100]  And you know, when we go back and we look at this.
[02:46:35.976 --> 02:46:37.516]  And I look at these last couple of days.
[02:46:37.516 --> 02:46:39.317]  We've mentioned this a couple times yesterday.
[02:46:39.317 --> 02:46:56.702]  The EPA, on all these last-minute regulations that they're putting out there, and we just talked to Craig Richardson with Energy and Environment Legal, and he was talking about how George Soros went in and got the bankrupted stocks of coal companies at a discounted price after Obama said, I'm going to bankrupt that industry.
[02:46:56.702 --> 02:47:01.243]  And now we have every single day for the last couple of days, we've had the EPA coming in
[02:47:02.023 --> 02:47:02.384]  I think?
[02:47:19.965 --> 02:47:26.070]  Terry Gilliam movie, the Monty Python movie, meaning of life part two, you know, where they have these corporate raider pirates.
[02:47:26.070 --> 02:47:27.331]  I mean, that's what the EPA did.
[02:47:27.331 --> 02:47:34.837]  They went in and they arrested VW's executives and now Volkswagen is warning their managers, don't come to the U.S.
[02:47:35.711 --> 02:47:38.993]  You'll be kidnapped by the EPA and held for ransom.
[02:47:38.993 --> 02:47:42.014]  And we just paid $4.3 billion to get this one guy out.
[02:47:42.014 --> 02:47:44.015]  They're going to arrest you as well if you go there.
[02:47:44.015 --> 02:47:44.876]  I mean, that's what's happening.
[02:47:44.876 --> 02:47:48.918]  But this may also be golden parachutes for these crooks.
[02:47:48.918 --> 02:47:53.880]  Remember we had the Stock Act when they caught Congress and they said, well, you know, that doesn't really apply to us.
[02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:55.201]  We can do insider trading.
[02:47:55.201 --> 02:47:58.603]  We know if we're going to take somebody with our laws, with our regulations,
[02:47:59.757 --> 02:48:01.379]  I wonder if that's the sort of thing that's going on.
[02:48:01.379 --> 02:48:22.597]  Boy, if you want an ethics investigation, somebody out there needs to go through this and make sure that nobody at the EPA, at Obama's EPA, is profiting off of them tanking one major corporation after another with threats of investigating their emissions tests.
[02:48:22.597 --> 02:48:26.000]  Okay, that's what I suspect something like that is really happening.
[02:48:26.567 --> 02:48:28.949]  Now I want to go to a report from John Bowne.
[02:48:28.949 --> 02:48:31.511]  He did a report talking about Obama's last speech.
[02:48:31.511 --> 02:48:35.033]  He goes to Chicago, where there is literally a war going on.
[02:48:35.033 --> 02:48:39.997]  About 4,000 people have died there in their gun-free killing zones that they've created.
[02:48:39.997 --> 02:48:42.539]  And he goes back there to give his farewell speech.
[02:48:42.539 --> 02:48:43.560]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[02:48:44.642 --> 02:49:00.269]  After eight years of enduring President Barack Obama's rampant hypocrisy, his final speech was nothing less than the great conclusion to the hyper-normalization that characterized his presidency.
[02:49:00.269 --> 02:49:07.212]  You can tell that I'm a lame duck because nobody's following instructions.
[02:49:07.212 --> 02:49:12.414]  If I had told you eight years ago that America would reverse the Great Recession,
[02:49:13.777 --> 02:49:25.608]  Reboot our auto industry and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history.
[02:49:25.608 --> 02:49:37.418]  If I had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9-11,
[02:49:42.193 --> 02:49:53.079]  If I had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another 20 million of our fellow citizens.
[02:49:53.079 --> 02:50:04.946]  If I had told you all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high.
[02:50:04.946 --> 02:50:07.127]  But that's what we did.
[02:50:07.127 --> 02:50:10.229]  After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America.
[02:50:12.771 --> 02:50:20.597]  And such a vision, however well intended, was never realistic.
[02:50:20.597 --> 02:50:27.942]  Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.
[02:50:27.942 --> 02:50:38.209]  Now I've lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say.
[02:50:38.209 --> 02:50:42.052]  You can see it, not just in statistics,
[02:50:43.476 --> 02:50:45.879]  You see it in the attitudes of young Americans across America.
[02:50:45.879 --> 02:50:47.120]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:51.746]  If only we had enough time to play the full 75 minutes for you, but there is about a five minute report.
[02:50:51.746 --> 02:50:54.108]  You can see that on Alex Jones' channel.
[02:50:54.108 --> 02:50:57.712]  The hypocrisy of Obama's last speech by John Bowne.
[02:50:57.712 --> 02:51:00.656]  Don't let the door hit you on the way out, O. Good riddance.
[02:51:03.897 --> 02:51:05.559]  Good day, America.
[02:51:05.559 --> 02:51:08.581]  Are you tired of your butt cheeks being frozen?

[02:52:51.146 --> 02:52:51.486]  GoBerkey.com.
[02:53:00.165 --> 02:53:00.825]  Hello again.
[02:53:00.825 --> 02:53:01.766]  My name is Gary Clark.
[02:53:01.766 --> 02:53:08.550]  I'm the actor who's turning 80 in August who played the part of Steve on the 1960s Western TV series, The Virginian.
[02:53:08.550 --> 02:53:13.372]  Now those of you who've suffered the side effects of prescribed medicines know what I'm talking about.
[02:53:13.372 --> 02:53:19.496]  And those of you who have watched the devastating effects that worrying about you has had on your loved one.
[02:53:19.896 --> 02:53:22.718]  And what I shared a few months ago is only part of the story.
[02:53:22.718 --> 02:53:27.541]  I neglected to mention how One World Whey Protein Powder has affected my life.
[02:53:27.541 --> 02:53:31.824]  Now I realize this is not dinner table conversation, but here goes anyway.
[02:53:31.824 --> 02:53:34.606]  One World Whey solved my irregularity.
[02:53:34.606 --> 02:53:39.149]  I'd been plagued with constipation for years and I thought it would be that way for the rest of my life.
[02:53:39.149 --> 02:53:42.751]  Three weeks on One World Whey set me on a new path.
[02:53:42.751 --> 02:53:45.833]  That was five months ago and I haven't been irregular since.
[02:53:46.133 --> 02:53:47.515]  Will it work the same way for you?
[02:53:47.515 --> 02:53:48.356]  I don't know.
[02:53:48.356 --> 02:53:49.537]  It worked for me.
[02:53:49.537 --> 02:53:52.461]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[02:53:52.461 --> 02:53:54.784]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[02:54:14.122 --> 02:54:15.443]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:15.443 --> 02:54:16.904]  I'm David Knight.
[02:54:16.904 --> 02:54:21.468]  We were just looking at Obama's last speech that he made in Chirac.
[02:54:21.468 --> 02:54:22.989]  That's what a lot of people call it.
[02:54:22.989 --> 02:54:26.412]  Kind of a combination of Chicago and Iraq.
[02:54:26.412 --> 02:54:38.022]  An acknowledgment of the fact that they have so many murders in the gun-free killing zones that have been created by the Democrats' policies there.
[02:54:38.022 --> 02:54:41.925]  That they've had as many, about 4,000 people die there over the eight years of Barack Obama.
[02:54:43.021 --> 02:54:48.763]  About the same number they've had that died during the Iraq and Afghanistan war under George W. Bush.
[02:54:48.763 --> 02:54:57.726]  You know, if I lived in that area, I would want to have some kind of protection for myself, and I'm sure that the liberals will next be trying to take away, as Lionel pointed out.
[02:54:57.726 --> 02:55:05.968]  I talked about our body armor yesterday, and Lionel said, you know, get it while you can, because if you can protect yourself with it, they'll probably try to ban it.
[02:55:05.968 --> 02:55:11.170]  And we've had bills introduced in certain areas already by Democrats trying to outlaw body armor.
[02:55:11.883 --> 02:55:12.623]  It's coming.
[02:55:12.623 --> 02:55:13.263]  Don't worry.
[02:55:13.263 --> 02:55:13.944]  It's coming.
[02:55:13.944 --> 02:55:16.944]  They don't want you to be able to protect yourself at all.
[02:55:16.944 --> 02:55:24.627]  Not with a gun, and not even with something that can't harm anybody, that is simply passive, simply defensive, and that is body armor.
[02:55:24.627 --> 02:55:35.510]  Again, we've put together a line of a patented form of carbon nanotube technology, the lightest, strongest, most flexible body armor on the market, even though it's only a quarter of an inch thick.
[02:55:35.510 --> 02:55:39.151]  It is field tested to stop the most powerful pistol rounds in production.
[02:55:39.551 --> 02:55:40.212]  It's waterproof.
[02:55:40.212 --> 02:55:41.172]  It's super lightweight.
[02:55:41.172 --> 02:55:41.893]  It's made in the U.S.
[02:55:41.893 --> 02:55:44.135]  It comes with a 20-year warranty.
[02:55:44.135 --> 02:55:47.858]  You can find that at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:55:47.858 --> 02:55:51.060]  In the past, this has only been available to the U.S.
[02:55:51.060 --> 02:55:52.622]  military and law enforcement.
[02:55:52.622 --> 02:55:54.983]  It is state-of-the-art in body armor.
[02:55:54.983 --> 02:55:58.987]  This isn't real heavy metal plates that are going to weigh you down.
[02:55:58.987 --> 02:56:01.569]  And you can get it, as I pointed out, in just an insert.
[02:56:02.009 --> 02:56:07.933]  They can go into your backpack to protect yourself at airports or when you're traveling or to protect your kids when they're going to school.
[02:56:07.933 --> 02:56:09.814]  A lot of kids take backpacks.
[02:56:09.814 --> 02:56:19.721]  You can put that in there when they're traveling to school in case somebody decides to attack them and they don't allow any adults to carry weapons to protect the kids there at the school.
[02:56:19.721 --> 02:56:22.883]  That's a very important thing to do for you and for your family.
[02:56:22.883 --> 02:56:26.345]  And of course, that insert is the cheapest part of the body armor.
[02:56:26.345 --> 02:56:30.948]  You can get that for just $200 and you can find that again at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:56:32.390 --> 02:56:48.833]  One of the interesting stories that came up today I thought was Julian Assange, of course the founder of WikiLeaks, he has agreed and gone publicly saying to Barack Obama, if you will release whistleblower Chelsea Manning, I will turn myself over to you.
[02:56:49.562 --> 02:56:53.929]  He says, if Obama grants Manning clemency, Assange will agree to U.S.
[02:56:53.929 --> 02:56:59.117]  extradition despite the clear unconstitutionality of the Department of Justice case.
[02:56:59.117 --> 02:57:01.621]  That's what WikiLeaks tweeted out.
[02:57:01.621 --> 02:57:02.743]  And that's just a reminder.
[02:57:03.709 --> 02:57:06.351]  Of another one of the legacies of Barack Obama.
[02:57:06.351 --> 02:57:15.419]  The fact that he has prosecuted whistleblowers and journalists under the 100-year-old Espionage Act of 1917.
[02:57:15.419 --> 02:57:21.504]  He has done that more than all the other presidents over the last 100 years combined.
[02:57:21.504 --> 02:57:30.232]  And remember, we talked to Thomas Drake, one of the NSA whistleblowers, and these are people who right after the Patriot Act was done, immediately following the 9-11 attack,
[02:57:32.068 --> 02:57:39.232]  They came out and said, with William Binney and Thomas Drake and others, they came out and said, we don't like what the government is doing.
[02:57:39.232 --> 02:57:42.214]  You're doing dragnet surveillance of the American people.
[02:57:42.214 --> 02:57:47.818]  What Joe Biggs was just talking about in that report that we played at the bottom of the hour.
[02:57:47.818 --> 02:57:49.779]  You're doing dragnet surveillance of the American people.
[02:57:49.779 --> 02:57:51.620]  William Binney and Thomas Drake and others said, we
[02:57:52.478 --> 02:57:55.620]  Take our oath to the Constitution very seriously.
[02:57:55.620 --> 02:57:58.261]  And you can do this without doing dragnet surveillance.
[02:57:58.261 --> 02:58:00.662]  As a matter of fact, they'd created software to do precisely that.
[02:58:00.662 --> 02:58:09.527]  But the government went with the people who had provided this as a private contractor, and they made a lot of money by doing that.
[02:58:09.527 --> 02:58:11.328]  I don't know if there were any kickbacks involved.
[02:58:11.328 --> 02:58:12.049]  Probably were.
[02:58:12.049 --> 02:58:18.132]  And yet, Thomas Drake was never prosecuted by the Bush administration.
[02:58:18.132 --> 02:58:21.514]  It was years later, almost 10 years later, when Barack Obama
[02:58:22.074 --> 02:58:23.454]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:00:11.354 --> 03:00:12.895]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:12.895 --> 03:00:23.103]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:23.103 --> 03:00:24.504]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:24.504 --> 03:00:25.905]  I'm David Knight.
[03:00:25.905 --> 03:00:31.770]  In the next segment, fourth hour, we're going to have Leanne McAdoo and Owen Schroer are going to be joining us to host the fourth hour.
[03:00:32.521 --> 03:00:39.546]  In this last segment, I want to talk a little bit about the CDC, and also about the issues that we see with RFK Jr.
[03:00:39.546 --> 03:00:48.472]  crossing the lines to work with Donald Trump on a very important issue, and that is the abuses of the CDC, specifically towards vaccines.
[03:00:48.472 --> 03:00:49.973]  He was very critical of the CDC.
[03:00:50.999 --> 03:00:53.660]  In terms of vaccines and what they're mandating to people.
[03:00:53.660 --> 03:01:14.891]  And also, at the same time, we see Allison Young, who works for USA Today, she's done a series of reports on the problems with biological operations, biological warfare, what they're developing with that, and the lax safety at the labs where they're doing this, especially at the CDC's own labs.
[03:01:14.891 --> 03:01:17.192]  And as she's repeatedly pointed out, she's got another article here,
[03:01:17.732 --> 03:01:21.997]  The CDC keeps secret its mishaps with deadly germs.
[03:01:21.997 --> 03:01:34.772]  She said the CDC's facilities are among a small group of biolab operators that have the worst regulatory histories in the country, receiving repeated sanctions under federal regulations.
[03:01:34.772 --> 03:01:35.412]  Think about that.
[03:01:35.412 --> 03:01:36.393]  The CDC itself
[03:01:37.290 --> 03:01:41.694]  is among the worst of the safety of the biolab operators.
[03:01:41.694 --> 03:01:45.417]  She said they've faced congressional hearings, they've had secret government sanctions.
[03:01:45.417 --> 03:01:46.698]  Secret government sanctions!
[03:01:46.698 --> 03:01:52.022]  See, they don't want the public to know how dangerous they are and what they're doing.
[03:01:52.022 --> 03:02:00.730]  So if they're going to hide these problems that they have at their biolabs from you, do you think they would hide the problems that they have with vaccines when they have a profit motive in that?
[03:02:01.926 --> 03:02:03.127]  See, that's the issue here.
[03:02:03.127 --> 03:02:05.449]  What are they hiding from us on all these issues?
[03:02:05.449 --> 03:02:07.191]  They have sloppy safety practices.
[03:02:07.191 --> 03:02:15.078]  They keep secret large swaths of information about dozens of recent incidents involving some of the world's most dangerous bacteria and viruses.
[03:02:15.078 --> 03:02:21.243]  She said CDC scientists apparently lost a box of deadly and highly regulated influenza specimens.
[03:02:21.243 --> 03:02:21.884]  Here's the latest one.
[03:02:22.504 --> 03:02:31.011]  Experienced multiple potential exposures involving viruses and bacteria, according to heavily redacted laboratory incident reports obtained by USA Today.
[03:02:31.011 --> 03:02:35.635]  See, even when you get an under 40 request, they redact most of the information that's in there.
[03:02:35.635 --> 03:02:38.037]  Several reports involve failures of safety equipment.
[03:02:38.037 --> 03:02:48.666]  In one, a scientist wearing full body space suit-like gear to protect against lethal, often untreatable viruses like Ebola, had their purified air connectors suddenly disconnect
[03:02:49.366 --> 03:02:53.789]  Again, in one of the world's most advanced biosafety level 4 labs.
[03:02:53.789 --> 03:02:57.631]  That's the most dangerous substances that they're controlling there.
[03:02:57.631 --> 03:03:08.879]  And so she said the CDC would not answer USA Today's questions about specific incidents which occurred at the agency's lab facilities in Atlanta and Fort Collins, Colorado from 2013 through 2015.
[03:03:08.879 --> 03:03:13.001]  Do you think maybe we need to audit the CDC?
[03:03:13.001 --> 03:03:13.602]  Not just the
[03:03:14.324 --> 03:03:15.504]  Fed, but the CDC?
[03:03:15.504 --> 03:03:16.745]  Yeah, of course they should be audited.
[03:03:16.745 --> 03:03:20.306]  We ought to audit all these pseudo-government organizations.
[03:03:20.306 --> 03:03:22.287]  They pretend to be government and they're private.
[03:03:22.287 --> 03:03:22.787]  Okay?
[03:03:22.787 --> 03:03:24.388]  Let's audit these people.
[03:03:24.388 --> 03:03:25.548]  Let's find out what's going on.
[03:03:25.548 --> 03:03:27.549]  Let's find out what's going on with the vaccine stuff.
[03:03:27.549 --> 03:03:28.669]  They're hiding this.
[03:03:28.669 --> 03:03:34.891]  They're messing around with Ebola at these level 4 safety labs and then redacting the information, keeping it secret.
[03:03:34.891 --> 03:03:38.793]  Even though they're getting sanctioned and penalized by the Congress, they don't want you to know about it.
[03:03:38.793 --> 03:03:39.213]  Meanwhile,
[03:03:39.833 --> 03:03:43.238]  I got this report handed to me from Kit Daniels.
[03:03:43.238 --> 03:03:46.723]  The Washington Post has got a report from the CDC and guess what?
[03:03:46.723 --> 03:03:52.150]  They say the real threat to your health is living in the country.
[03:03:52.150 --> 03:03:53.432]  You should live in the city.
[03:03:55.137 --> 03:03:59.020]  They say rural Americans are more likely to die from the top five causes of death.
[03:03:59.020 --> 03:04:05.404]  Here's the Washington Post dutifully reporting the propaganda from the globalist elite.
[03:04:05.404 --> 03:04:13.430]  The globalist elite who want you to be living in the cities, part of the Agenda 21, also selling you the climate change stuff, also selling you diesel gates.
[03:04:13.430 --> 03:04:15.591]  See, these are all interconnected.
[03:04:15.591 --> 03:04:21.876]  And they want to tell you that you're at more risk living in the country than you are living in the city.
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:24.622]  You know that's not true.
[03:04:24.622 --> 03:04:25.423]  That's never been true.
[03:04:25.423 --> 03:04:31.692]  It was Thomas Jefferson that said cities are a threat to the health, the wealth, and the liberty of mankind and nothing has changed.
[03:04:31.692 --> 03:04:33.495]  You know that from your own personal observations.
[03:04:33.495 --> 03:04:37.040]  And yet, you have all these people who are all together on this Agenda 21
[03:04:39.554 --> 03:04:41.296]  That they're pushing on everybody.
[03:04:41.296 --> 03:04:43.439]  People like the CEO of Lyft who is an urban planner.
[03:04:43.439 --> 03:04:47.284]  All the urban planners are telling you the cities are utopia.
[03:04:47.284 --> 03:04:52.990]  It's the suburbs and the rural areas that are bad and it's the cars that get you there that have to be shut down.
[03:04:52.990 --> 03:04:54.392]  You need to be staying in the cities.
[03:04:54.392 --> 03:04:58.176]  We need to take your transportation away and keep you confined in those cities for your own safety.
[03:05:00.424 --> 03:05:02.165]  Here's Donald Trump on Twitter today.
[03:05:02.165 --> 03:05:03.006]  He also tweeted, Amen.
[03:05:03.006 --> 03:05:04.407]  Now, here is Rosie O'Donnell on Twitter.
[03:05:25.902 --> 03:05:33.369]  I fully support imposing martial law, delaying the inauguration until Trump is cleared of all charges!
[03:05:33.369 --> 03:05:36.072]  All her hearsay mafia minion followers agreed.
[03:05:36.072 --> 03:05:40.176]  The only problem with that is, there are no charges to be cleared!
[03:05:40.176 --> 03:05:42.578]  Just fake news allegations that you fall for.
[03:05:42.578 --> 03:05:44.520]  Remember her side of the fence before the election?
[03:05:44.520 --> 03:05:46.081]  When they go low, we go high?
[03:05:46.081 --> 03:05:48.263]  Trump and Republicans need to accept the results?
[03:05:48.263 --> 03:05:48.964]  So much for that.

[03:05:56.235 --> 03:05:58.338]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars.com

[03:08:33.204 --> 03:08:39.269]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:42.944 --> 03:08:44.505]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:44.505 --> 03:08:48.567]  Owen Schroer, Leanne McAdoo with you and we have stacks of news.
[03:08:48.567 --> 03:08:52.429]  We were just trying to shuffle through all of it before we got on air here.
[03:08:52.429 --> 03:08:59.153]  And the big thing that I want to start with here, Leanne, is everything that's going on on Capitol Hill right now.
[03:08:59.153 --> 03:09:01.754]  It was a wild week on Capitol Hill.
[03:09:01.754 --> 03:09:03.115]  I mean, truly amazing.
[03:09:03.115 --> 03:09:07.197]  I don't know if there's ever been a more entertaining week on Capitol Hill
[03:09:07.677 --> 03:09:07.857]  Yeah.
[03:09:40.160 --> 03:09:41.060]  We need a plan!
[03:09:41.060 --> 03:09:41.781]  We need a plan!
[03:09:41.781 --> 03:09:43.102]  It's like, okay, yeah, we need a plan.
[03:09:43.102 --> 03:09:46.065]  We're not going to come into this, obviously, with nothing.
[03:09:46.065 --> 03:09:50.670]  But they have this weird attitude where it's like they really think that health care is not going to exist.
[03:09:50.670 --> 03:09:51.851]  They need some new plan.
[03:09:51.851 --> 03:09:52.812]  And I'm sitting here scratching my head.
[03:09:52.812 --> 03:09:58.137]  I'm like, why don't we just go back to what it was before the Affordable Care Act?
[03:09:58.137 --> 03:10:01.921]  Is that like too simple that people can't even wrap their head around it?
[03:10:02.421 --> 03:10:09.006]  Right, and Donald Trump and others have made it known that they like some of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act.
[03:10:09.006 --> 03:10:13.449]  Obviously that they can't deny you coverage if you have pre-existing conditions.
[03:10:13.449 --> 03:10:17.272]  They're going to keep that regardless of what new plan they come up with.
[03:10:17.272 --> 03:10:19.654]  That is something everyone can agree on.
[03:10:19.654 --> 03:10:23.697]  But they're just going to open up to a little bit of competition so that we can actually get these prices down.
[03:10:23.697 --> 03:10:28.701]  And Donald Trump's plan that he put out there was opening it up so they can go across state lines.
[03:10:29.451 --> 03:10:29.851]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:10:47.924 --> 03:10:59.110]  I couldn't believe this, and I don't think I've ever seen anything like this, and people, pundits were writing about it, but the Democrats who were voting no on the proposed budget that would eventually gut the Affordable Care Act...
[03:10:59.830 --> 03:11:16.882]  We're up there trying to debate, or they were lecturing everybody that was in the hall at the time, and every time the presiding officer over the hearing had to slam his gavel and tell the person, hey, we're not debating here.
[03:11:16.882 --> 03:11:18.243]  This is a vote.
[03:11:18.243 --> 03:11:20.325]  You are wasting everyone's time.
[03:11:20.325 --> 03:11:21.786]  And I saw it again today.
[03:11:21.786 --> 03:11:26.469]  This was going on as the House was deliberating on this before the vote.
[03:11:26.469 --> 03:11:28.690]  It was just like Donald Trump with the media.
[03:11:29.631 --> 03:11:37.018]  These petulant children, as you have been phrasing it for a while, now are having to be scolded like petulant children.
[03:11:37.018 --> 03:11:38.359]  It's happening on the Hill.
[03:11:38.359 --> 03:11:39.961]  It's happening in the media.
[03:11:39.961 --> 03:11:40.982]  It's really amazing to see.
[03:11:40.982 --> 03:11:51.071]  It's about to be happening at the inauguration with, you know, celebrities and scientists and activists and all sorts of people that just cannot stand the fact that Donald Trump's going to be the president.
[03:11:53.547 --> 03:11:56.248]  We're actually going to talk about that because we've got some news on that.
[03:11:56.248 --> 03:11:58.609]  Obviously, we're going to be at the inauguration.
[03:11:58.609 --> 03:12:00.470]  This is the place where you want to get the coverage, folks.
[03:12:00.470 --> 03:12:02.090]  We're going to be on the streets.
[03:12:02.090 --> 03:12:04.291]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:12:04.291 --> 03:12:06.372]  But, you know, here was some irony that I found in this.
[03:12:06.372 --> 03:12:14.876]  So the Democrats, a lot of them oppose Mattis being allowed to serve his position because of the military
[03:12:15.476 --> 03:12:16.017]  I don't
[03:12:31.269 --> 03:12:41.774]  As what the Republicans are going to do with the Affordable Care Act to replace it, which again, actually Republicans time and time again, they bring this up and the Republicans on the floor say, here's the plan.
[03:12:41.774 --> 03:12:42.755]  We've got six different plans.
[03:12:42.755 --> 03:12:47.357]  They literally shake the binder with the plan and they still say, we need a plan, we need a plan.
[03:12:47.357 --> 03:12:53.480]  But the Democrats need to put out that fake news that they have no plan and they just want to take it away and stop your grandma from having healthcare.
[03:12:53.480 --> 03:12:55.301]  It's better to put that fake news out there.
[03:12:55.301 --> 03:12:58.063]  Look at this complete hypocrisy and irony.
[03:12:58.063 --> 03:12:59.984]  They offer no replacement for Mattis.
[03:13:00.684 --> 03:13:05.907]  So they're up here complaining about how Mattis cannot serve, but they offer no replacement.
[03:13:05.907 --> 03:13:07.828]  Oh, but we need a plan!
[03:13:07.828 --> 03:13:09.348]  I need a plan!
[03:13:09.348 --> 03:13:11.670]  Show me the plan to replace Obamacare!
[03:13:11.670 --> 03:13:12.590]  Show me the plan!
[03:13:12.590 --> 03:13:14.411]  Oh, actually, here's a plan.
[03:13:14.411 --> 03:13:17.312]  The woman's name was Diane Black.
[03:13:17.312 --> 03:13:18.113]  She's from Tennessee.
[03:13:18.913 --> 03:13:25.797]  And every time one of these Democrats would come up from the Senate today and say, I need to see a plan.
[03:13:25.797 --> 03:13:30.160]  I cannot just have all these people with health care just go in with no coverage.
[03:13:30.160 --> 03:13:32.161]  I need to see a plan before we can move forward.
[03:13:32.161 --> 03:13:36.083]  I can't believe Republicans would even suggest such a thing without a plan.
[03:13:36.083 --> 03:13:41.326]  And then Diane Black for like the fifth time in 30 minutes goes, here's the plan right here.
[03:13:41.326 --> 03:13:42.967]  We have binders, a lot of plans.
[03:13:42.967 --> 03:13:44.588]  People, Donald Trump has offered plans.
[03:13:44.588 --> 03:13:45.989]  We have state competition.
[03:13:46.989 --> 03:13:48.850]  Well, I need to see a plan here.
[03:13:48.850 --> 03:13:50.391]  I cannot believe the Republicans.
[03:13:50.391 --> 03:13:51.072]  It's like, what is going on?
[03:13:51.072 --> 03:13:55.054]  It's like they got their talking points and it does not, they're in total disregard for the truth.
[03:13:55.054 --> 03:13:58.577]  They've been given the talking points that the GOP has no plan.
[03:13:58.577 --> 03:14:06.722]  They have no plan because that's, that allows, you know, the people here, the American people to get the little chitter chatter on Facebook and, you know, fight with everyone.
[03:14:06.722 --> 03:14:07.663]  Well, they have no plan.
[03:14:07.663 --> 03:14:08.983]  I mean, it just, it's.
[03:14:10.224 --> 03:14:12.005]  Which they buy completely, obviously.
[03:14:12.005 --> 03:14:15.066]  Just like, well, we don't need to go down the dossier.
[03:14:15.066 --> 03:14:16.187]  Just like they bought that.
[03:14:16.187 --> 03:14:16.887]  Exactly.
[03:14:16.887 --> 03:14:20.389]  Well, anything they can to just stymie Donald Trump becoming the president.
[03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:28.473]  And so they, the Democrats, have obviously gotten fairly hostile in their posture to just totally resist Donald Trump.
[03:14:28.473 --> 03:14:31.074]  But the Daily Caller points out how if anyone
[03:14:31.614 --> 03:14:48.508]  Should have been able to be stopped as far as Donald Trump's appointments It should have been Jeff Sessions, but he almost certainly is gonna become the Attorney General I mean they levied all sorts of racist charges against him at least allegations of rate racism So he actually had a failed confirmation once before
[03:14:49.898 --> 03:14:58.226]  So, you know, the fact that they weren't able to even stop Jeff Sessions, that kind of shows how impotent the Democrats are to stop Donald Trump.
[03:14:58.226 --> 03:14:59.647]  Well, and they just don't have the numbers.
[03:14:59.647 --> 03:15:05.132]  They're just flat out, the math just does not work out for them right now when it comes to these votes.
[03:15:05.132 --> 03:15:10.277]  Certainly the tears outweigh on their side, but unfortunately that's not what measures the vote.
[03:15:10.797 --> 03:15:15.141]  Now that we were talking about the dossier, this was truly unbelievable, folks.
[03:15:15.141 --> 03:15:19.426]  I don't know if you saw the story in Salon, Leanne.
[03:15:19.426 --> 03:15:22.609]  Salon gets even worse and worse every day, and it's amazing.
[03:15:22.609 --> 03:15:25.752]  It's actually quite an accomplishment to be able to say that for Salon.
[03:15:26.152 --> 03:15:29.214]  What do we know about Donald Trump's outrageous dossier?
[03:15:29.214 --> 03:15:30.255]  Almost nothing.
[03:15:30.255 --> 03:15:31.335]  Well, almost nothing.
[03:15:31.335 --> 03:15:32.576]  Actually, we know a lot about it.
[03:15:32.576 --> 03:15:35.438]  It was fake, and we know who perpetrated the false narrative.
[03:15:35.438 --> 03:15:41.482]  But Salon clearly knows nothing, except that it exposes his most serious weakness.
[03:15:41.482 --> 03:15:43.664]  Trump got this far by smashing political norms.
[03:15:43.664 --> 03:15:44.564]  Yeah, thank God.
[03:15:44.564 --> 03:15:52.469]  Now he's left with no real friends, even though he has thousands, 20,000 people at every rally he goes to, and little political capital.
[03:15:52.469 --> 03:15:54.531]  He's the President of the United States.
[03:15:55.191 --> 03:15:58.494]  Salon lives in complete rejection of reality.
[03:15:58.494 --> 03:16:00.456]  They go on, they go on Leanne.
[03:16:00.456 --> 03:16:08.622]  For an ordinary politician who pretty much plays by the rules, an unsubstantiated story of such salaciousness generally would not even reach the public.
[03:16:08.622 --> 03:16:11.144]  They're blaming Trump!
[03:16:11.144 --> 03:16:12.285]  Can you believe this?
[03:16:13.166 --> 03:16:16.168]  They're actually blaming Donald Trump!
[03:16:16.168 --> 03:16:38.723]  Well, it's like, we see how, you know, stories that should have tanked Hillary Clinton decades ago, really, how they have never made it to the surface, her and Bill, because the media, they're protecting them, so you can see how the media, when they're not protecting you, they're just gonna go and take these salacious allegations that they even spell out, you really shouldn't believe this, this probably isn't true, but we're gonna put it out there for you anyway.
[03:16:38.723 --> 03:16:42.986]  That's the difference when you have the media hacks on your side versus not.
[03:16:43.226 --> 03:16:48.109]  And then it finishes the little story here talking about credibility mattering.
[03:16:48.109 --> 03:16:54.573]  Salon, who stands up for pedophiles and blames Donald Trump for a despicable dossier against Donald Trump.
[03:16:54.573 --> 03:17:02.779]  And I love also, too, now the new thing they're putting out is this ex-British intelligence officer who was gathering all this intel.
[03:17:02.779 --> 03:17:05.160]  He's James Bond.
[03:17:05.160 --> 03:17:06.241]  He's James Bond.
[03:17:06.241 --> 03:17:08.022]  How dare you question his intel?
[03:17:08.022 --> 03:17:10.003]  He's lame, Bond.
[03:17:10.003 --> 03:17:10.744]  A total failure.
[03:17:11.509 --> 03:17:13.830]  Oh, it's just so frustrating.
[03:17:13.830 --> 03:17:16.611]  Now, here's the thing.
[03:17:16.611 --> 03:17:23.333]  Some sort of moderator or administrator for 4chan actually talked to Michael Savage yesterday, and they're claiming complete responsibility.
[03:17:23.333 --> 03:17:27.374]  They're like, we planted this, we wanted to see how far it could go.
[03:17:27.374 --> 03:17:35.497]  Now, that's what I said yesterday when we were talking on the nightly news, and I'm not sure if that's completely substantiated yet or true, but it certainly had something to do with it.
[03:17:35.697 --> 03:17:48.444]  Well it's funny because then you have like Anonymous tweeting out you know that I mean they're all for this dossier they say it's true they say the Russians absolutely have something against Trump and so there's like kind of this coup going on with the hackers so.
[03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:59.023]  I want to get into this story on the other side about the Chinese state media and Rex Tillerson yesterday, but to finish out this segment, Leigh-Anne, let's talk about this story.
[03:17:59.023 --> 03:18:06.366]  Scientists race to develop vaccine for the plague amid fears terrorists could use the medieval disease to kill millions.
[03:18:06.366 --> 03:18:11.988]  Now I'm sitting here, I'm scratching my head, and in this story, it's out of the sun, and of course, you know,
[03:18:13.018 --> 03:18:17.920]  You kind of face this when you're in the media, when you think about what to report or what to say.
[03:18:17.920 --> 03:18:26.402]  For example, them talking about basically how terrorists could use this bacteria to kill millions of people, and I'm sitting here like, well boy, I hope a terrorist doesn't read this.
[03:18:26.402 --> 03:18:26.663]  Yeah.
[03:18:26.663 --> 03:18:28.403]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:18:28.403 --> 03:18:30.784]  Who knows if they have the capability or the capacity, but...
[03:18:31.244 --> 03:18:41.207]  A couple years ago, they actually sort of spelled out exactly how a terrorist would be able to take the plague and develop it into... It's like they're begging for it.
[03:18:41.207 --> 03:18:46.308]  Wow, you actually just spelled it out and let them know the exact means by which to carry this out.
[03:18:46.308 --> 03:18:50.649]  Yeah, it's almost like, oh, I hope a terrorist doesn't get their hands on that.
[03:18:50.649 --> 03:18:52.910]  Yeah, like Hillary Clinton's open email server.
[03:18:52.910 --> 03:18:59.252]  Oh, I hope nobody hacks the open server I have over here that donated millions to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:18:59.992 --> 03:19:12.199]  Yeah, well, and that kind of tied in for me, for some reason I was thinking about the, um, you were talking about those, um, the little drones that the military... Oh, the miniature, the macro, micro drones?
[03:19:12.199 --> 03:19:12.819]  Yeah.
[03:19:12.819 --> 03:19:15.061]  So talk about a way to... The swarm of them.
[03:19:15.061 --> 03:19:16.321]  The drone swarm.
[03:19:16.321 --> 03:19:17.622]  It's like a locust.
[03:19:17.622 --> 03:19:27.848]  Yeah, it's like a locust swarm of these drones, which are constantly being warned that these could be reverse engineered, that terrorists could get their hands on them, and then think about, ugh, just attached to a weaponized plague.
[03:19:28.308 --> 03:19:29.088]  Mm-hmm.
[03:19:29.088 --> 03:19:30.389]  Well, actually, it's amazing.
[03:19:30.389 --> 03:19:31.869]  I mean, I lived in St.
[03:19:31.869 --> 03:19:32.069]  Louis.
[03:19:32.069 --> 03:19:37.950]  I don't know if this happens in Texas, but the locusts come out every seven years or whatever, and there's swarms of them in the air.
[03:19:37.950 --> 03:19:40.131]  That's what these drones look like that you're talking about.
[03:19:40.131 --> 03:19:45.972]  But I don't know if, you know, terrorists have the capacity to create a bacteria weapon.
[03:19:45.972 --> 03:19:53.574]  I do know that companies have the capacity to mass-produce and mass-sell vaccines, and they love doing that.
[03:19:53.574 --> 03:19:54.715]  More on the Alex Jones Show.

[03:24:12.731 --> 03:24:14.512]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:14.512 --> 03:24:17.113]  Fourth hour, Owen Schroer, Leigh Ann McAdoo with you.
[03:24:17.113 --> 03:24:20.075]  And it has been a crazy week on the Hill.
[03:24:20.075 --> 03:24:21.856]  The inauguration is next week.
[03:24:21.856 --> 03:24:22.936]  We will have all the coverage.
[03:24:22.936 --> 03:24:30.540]  We'll be on the streets and bringing you all the up-to-date footage, protests, news, whatever's going on.
[03:24:30.540 --> 03:24:35.463]  And we're actually going to get a lot more into that into the next segment.
[03:24:35.463 --> 03:24:37.524]  We've got some developments with the Trump protests.
[03:24:38.224 --> 03:24:49.555]  Some more disgustingness coming out of the anti-Trump people and also a very interesting and important move out of the DC National Guard that we're going to cover as well in the next segment.
[03:24:49.555 --> 03:24:52.097]  But this segment, I want to talk about this
[03:24:53.178 --> 03:24:59.186]  Chinese state media tells Donald Trump's team to prepare for military clash.
[03:24:59.186 --> 03:25:07.416]  Now, this story is coming out of a Chinese tabloid, so how much, you know, gravitas you want to take out of this is up to you.
[03:25:07.416 --> 03:25:08.937]  But there is actually something behind this.
[03:25:08.937 --> 03:25:09.658]  I'm going to explain this.
[03:25:10.299 --> 03:25:11.040]  It says, the U.S.
[03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:17.147]  should prepare for a military clash, a state-run Chinese tabloid newspaper has warned.
[03:25:17.147 --> 03:25:19.009]  Less than 24 hours after U.S.
[03:25:19.009 --> 03:25:27.539]  Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson appeared to call for a blockade of the South China Sea islands is when this story was put out.
[03:25:27.539 --> 03:25:29.100]  Now, this is the key here, Leigh-Anne.
[03:25:29.841 --> 03:25:50.363]  So, Rex Tillerson, in his hearing yesterday, obviously had to go and answer a lot of questions, and I'm not sure the exact nature of the question that was brought up that led to him talking about the situation in the South China Seas, but basically he brought up the situation, how there's turmoil and tension in the South China Seas, there's territorial battles going on.
[03:25:51.043 --> 03:25:58.469]  He talks about how the Chinese are essentially building their own islands out there, laming stake to those, you know, militarizing those islands.
[03:25:58.469 --> 03:26:07.957]  It's kind of an unprecedented move, honestly, but also it's a move that is making the other countries in the region not too happy about it.
[03:26:07.957 --> 03:26:14.102]  But there's something that they didn't talk about that's very important here that Rex Tillerson knows damn well, okay?
[03:26:14.102 --> 03:26:14.603]  Trust me.
[03:26:15.163 --> 03:26:20.465]  Now, the territory battle in the South China Sea goes beyond just territory.
[03:26:20.465 --> 03:26:26.747]  There is actually a ton of oil in this region and a lot of oil exploration going on.
[03:26:26.747 --> 03:26:33.309]  So this territory battle also has a lot to do with claims to the energy that's coming out of the South China Sea.
[03:26:33.309 --> 03:26:33.969]  And again,
[03:26:34.489 --> 03:26:36.329]  Rex Tillerson knows this, folks.
[03:26:36.329 --> 03:26:37.390]  Trust me.
[03:26:37.390 --> 03:26:38.470]  He knows this.
[03:26:38.470 --> 03:26:45.352]  So this is something, to me, Leigh-Anne, that is going to be kind of ongoing developing.
[03:26:45.352 --> 03:26:47.272]  Tillerson obviously knows this.
[03:26:47.272 --> 03:26:50.593]  They didn't really touch on it in the hearing yesterday.
[03:26:50.593 --> 03:26:51.553]  But what do you think?
[03:26:51.553 --> 03:26:58.135]  I mean, is China... And they actually mention this in the story, how if the U.S.
[03:26:58.135 --> 03:27:02.396]  wants to stop what China is doing in the South China Sea, they essentially have to
[03:27:03.536 --> 03:27:05.858]  Send physical troops there, send ships there.
[03:27:05.858 --> 03:27:10.120]  I mean, it would have to be a physical hot war if they actually wanted to stop this.
[03:27:10.120 --> 03:27:11.661]  I mean, is this what we're looking at here?
[03:27:11.661 --> 03:27:13.302]  I mean, we've been looking at the Russians.
[03:27:13.302 --> 03:27:13.622]  Right.
[03:27:13.622 --> 03:27:16.584]  Maybe we're ignoring a bigger fish here with the China, the Chinese.
[03:27:16.584 --> 03:27:17.865]  Of course, Alex has been saying that.
[03:27:17.865 --> 03:27:23.328]  Well, the Chinese military has already been making some really aggressive posturing this week as well.
[03:27:23.328 --> 03:27:27.370]  This is even before Rex Tillerson made that statement.
[03:27:27.370 --> 03:27:29.232]  So, yeah, they're definitely trying to
[03:27:29.912 --> 03:27:30.292]  I don't know.
[03:27:49.997 --> 03:27:51.658]  Well, what the U.S.
[03:27:51.658 --> 03:27:54.479]  can do, or what the U.S.
[03:27:54.479 --> 03:28:09.825]  has done in the past, is use the military-industrial complex proxy wars to kind of politicize those regions so that they can bring in their oil executives to come take that energy and then filter that profit to whoever plays the game.
[03:28:09.825 --> 03:28:13.087]  Well, you guys are fighting over this, so we're going to take it away from you.
[03:28:13.087 --> 03:28:13.887]  Right, right.
[03:28:13.887 --> 03:28:15.668]  We'll divvy it up fairly, believe me.
[03:28:15.748 --> 03:28:19.050]  So it should be interesting to see what goes on with that.
[03:28:19.050 --> 03:28:24.314]  But that's kind of the untold story within the story, is all the oil and the energy to be had there.
[03:28:24.314 --> 03:28:27.716]  And I'm just going to say this- Yeah, we're supposed to have all eyes on Russia, but really, what about China?
[03:28:27.716 --> 03:28:31.579]  And I'm just going to say this about Rex Tillerson, and I'm not going to go too deep into this.
[03:28:31.579 --> 03:28:33.400]  You can take what you want from this.
[03:28:33.400 --> 03:28:41.466]  But I think at this point, Rex Tillerson to me is either a globalist implant and perhaps a danger to the Trump administration.
[03:28:42.390 --> 03:28:47.573]  Or an absolute neutron bomb against the New World Order.
[03:28:47.573 --> 03:28:49.393]  I think that he's one of those two right now.
[03:28:49.393 --> 03:29:03.300]  And I'm going to be keeping my eyes close to Rex Tillerson because I actually think if he's the neutron bomb against the establishment, against the New World Order, that he could potentially be, I think his life might be in danger just as much as Donald Trump's, Leanne, to be honest with you.
[03:29:03.300 --> 03:29:04.941]  Well, I was reading an article on Breitbart.
[03:29:04.941 --> 03:29:09.303]  They did some pretty fair coverage, just kind of making fun of the fact that all of the news
[03:29:09.963 --> 03:29:10.363]  We're good.
[03:29:30.018 --> 03:29:36.481]  Well, and it was amazing, too, because him, Tillerson, and Pompeo went along with a lot of the establishment talking points that had a lot of people worried.
[03:29:36.481 --> 03:29:40.483]  So I'm wondering if they're playing possum, or if Trump really means it when he says, think of yourself.
[03:29:40.483 --> 03:29:40.863]  I don't know.
[03:29:40.863 --> 03:29:43.844]  More news on the other side, specifically regarding the inauguration.
[03:29:43.844 --> 03:29:49.587]  Owen Troyer, Leanne McAdoo, Alex Jones Show, fourth hour.
[03:29:49.587 --> 03:29:50.988]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.988 --> 03:29:53.529]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.529 --> 03:29:56.190]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.197 --> 03:30:11.762]  Yesterday, the Senate took the first step towards repealing the Affordable Care Act with a 51-48 vote on a new budget blueprint that would open the doors to gut and rid ourselves of the disaster that is Obamacare without allowing Democrats to filibuster.
[03:30:11.762 --> 03:30:24.567]  Liberal tears flowed heavy as the Senate had to be called in order every time a Democrat voted no, with a nice lecture to go with it, forcing the providing officer, Senator Cory Gardner, to slam his gavel and scold the Democrats, repeating ad nauseam, debate is not allowed during a vote.
[03:30:24.687 --> 03:30:27.768]  Now today, the vote moves on to the House, where we have had similar results.
[03:30:27.768 --> 03:30:37.893]  The debate has been heated, with Democrats speaking past their time, bringing in large, blown-up photos of children to win sympathy points, and trying to argue that Republicans are ending healthcare, like before the Affordable Care Act, right?
[03:30:37.893 --> 03:30:50.159]  Senator Hakeem Jeffries claims that voting against the Affordable Care Act sets up Americans to be screwed by bigwigs and fat cats in the healthcare industry, ignoring the fact that this is what the Affordable Care Act did, creating healthcare monopolies in some regions.
[03:30:50.299 --> 03:30:56.183]  He also said that Republicans had no plan, to which Republicans responded by showing the many plans they brought to the debate floor.
[03:30:56.183 --> 03:30:59.946]  This is Owen Troyer, and I've got jugs of liberal tears here.
[03:30:59.946 --> 03:31:05.050]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[03:34:06.291 --> 03:34:06.792]  Believe it or not.
[03:34:22.114 --> 03:34:29.880]  Talking about this in the mainstream now, how telomeres are the secret to living a longer life, and well, we already had this.
[03:34:29.880 --> 03:34:31.461]  We knew this for a long time.
[03:34:31.461 --> 03:34:34.624]  That's why we're the groundbreaking products at InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:35:02.779 --> 03:35:03.059]  No.
[03:35:03.059 --> 03:35:03.959]  That's something if you want.
[03:35:03.959 --> 03:35:04.960]  Fully juiced.
[03:35:04.960 --> 03:35:05.620]  Yeah.
[03:35:05.620 --> 03:35:06.440]  High energy.
[03:35:06.440 --> 03:35:10.261]  Even your high brand expensive ones out there don't even have high quality.
[03:35:10.261 --> 03:35:10.841]  It is amazing.
[03:35:10.841 --> 03:35:14.943]  I mean Alex and actually I think David was talking about this today too.
[03:35:14.943 --> 03:35:22.185]  The days when I don't take all of my InfoWars Life products all the supplements I take the mornings I don't take that I can feel it.
[03:35:22.185 --> 03:35:26.346]  I can feel it by noon and then the days where I do I feel great all day long.
[03:35:26.346 --> 03:35:30.547]  But I'll tell you what who doesn't feel great night right now and that's Madonna.
[03:35:30.547 --> 03:35:32.108]  You know she's
[03:35:33.305 --> 03:35:37.046]  You know, baby's blood is doing her all right.
[03:35:37.046 --> 03:35:40.986]  Look, Madonna said that Trump winning was like a bad breakup.
[03:35:40.986 --> 03:35:45.027]  It's been really tough for Madonna, folks, but she's not done.
[03:35:45.027 --> 03:35:48.888]  You know, her meltdown continues to spiral out of control.
[03:35:48.888 --> 03:35:57.290]  And it's, you know, you thought that she reached a new low and she offered a little fellatio in order for you to vote for Hillary Clinton.
[03:35:57.290 --> 03:35:58.830]  No, no, it's gone lower.
[03:35:58.830 --> 03:35:59.670]  Get out the vote on that.
[03:35:59.850 --> 03:36:00.510]  It's gone lower.
[03:36:00.510 --> 03:36:01.491]  No, it didn't work.
[03:36:01.491 --> 03:36:05.693]  Most people, unfortunately, did not want fellatio from Madonna.
[03:36:05.693 --> 03:36:11.436]  But now, on Instagram, she has shared a public hair up... Excuse me, public.
[03:36:11.436 --> 03:36:13.077]  I can't even... I don't want to say this.
[03:36:13.077 --> 03:36:14.818]  A pubic hair.
[03:36:14.818 --> 03:36:19.781]  A pubic hair photo with the Nike logo saying, just do it.
[03:36:19.781 --> 03:36:25.124]  And of course, she is referring to protesting Donald Trump's inauguration.
[03:36:25.124 --> 03:36:28.086]  And this is part of the Women's March.
[03:36:29.006 --> 03:36:36.750]  On Washington, they're expecting over 200,000 people at this march, and Madonna says, with her pubic hair, just do it!
[03:36:36.750 --> 03:36:37.530]  Show up!
[03:36:37.530 --> 03:36:38.711]  You gotta protest.
[03:36:38.711 --> 03:36:43.473]  Hey, I'm not gonna tell everyone what you told me in the room earlier.
[03:36:43.473 --> 03:36:44.753]  Why do you gotta say that?
[03:36:44.753 --> 03:36:49.956]  I'll let everyone know how you really feel about Madonna.
[03:36:49.956 --> 03:36:53.437]  Look, Madonna, here's the thing.
[03:36:53.437 --> 03:36:54.578]  What's your favorite Madonna song?
[03:36:54.907 --> 03:36:58.589]  I can't say a favorite Madonna song, I can only tell you a favorite Madonna album.
[03:36:58.589 --> 03:37:01.691]  But I will tell you this, I will tell you this.
[03:37:01.691 --> 03:37:06.893]  I'm glad that when I went and I went to her concert, I'm glad I ended up not touching her.
[03:37:06.893 --> 03:37:07.513]  I was close.
[03:37:07.513 --> 03:37:12.856]  I almost touched her hand after reading this story and hearing her offer fellatio for a vote.
[03:37:12.856 --> 03:37:16.118]  I'm glad I did not touch Madonna at that concert.
[03:37:16.118 --> 03:37:17.058]  But it's just incredible.
[03:37:19.448 --> 03:37:24.012]  Who in their right mind, these people aren't in their right mind is the correct answer here.
[03:37:24.012 --> 03:37:28.937]  So I guess it's a trick question, but who in their right mind puts out a pubic hair shot?
[03:37:28.937 --> 03:37:37.886]  This is like J-Lo literally bending over, putting a microphone up to her butt, and then sitting here complaining about how Donald Trump objectifies women.
[03:37:38.396 --> 03:37:39.016]  Right.
[03:37:39.016 --> 03:37:39.536]  What?
[03:37:39.536 --> 03:37:44.038]  Yes, that's... You just put out a picture of your private part.
[03:37:44.038 --> 03:37:44.958]  Your hoo-ha.
[03:37:44.958 --> 03:37:48.779]  It looks like it has one of those fake mustaches cut out on it.
[03:37:48.779 --> 03:37:53.261]  I'm not going to talk about the actual... The actual picture itself.
[03:37:53.261 --> 03:37:56.181]  You can go to InfoWars.com and check out the article.
[03:37:56.181 --> 03:38:02.503]  But this is just, you know, one of the women that's supposed to show up to this women's protest.
[03:38:02.503 --> 03:38:03.524]  Katy Perry will be there.
[03:38:03.524 --> 03:38:05.804]  Katy Perry, Lena Dunham.
[03:38:05.804 --> 03:38:05.864]  Oh!
[03:38:05.864 --> 03:38:06.485]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:38:06.485 --> 03:38:07.065]  We said women.
[03:38:07.833 --> 03:38:08.614]  This is true.
[03:38:08.614 --> 03:38:13.117]  Meanwhile, we do have another actress, Nicole Kidman, kind of speaking out, saying, hey, you know what?
[03:38:13.117 --> 03:38:15.158]  It's time for America to get behind the president.
[03:38:15.158 --> 03:38:16.159]  But you know what, though?
[03:38:16.159 --> 03:38:16.920]  Get over it.
[03:38:16.920 --> 03:38:17.300]  I'm sorry.
[03:38:17.300 --> 03:38:19.982]  I got to cut you off here because I want to get more to the bottom of this, Leanne.
[03:38:19.982 --> 03:38:20.882]  You're still on the story.
[03:38:20.882 --> 03:38:22.323]  Well, no, beyond Madonna, though.
[03:38:22.323 --> 03:38:23.704]  OK, so you've got all these women.
[03:38:23.704 --> 03:38:24.885]  They want to march on Washington.
[03:38:24.885 --> 03:38:25.666]  All right.
[03:38:25.666 --> 03:38:27.947]  And this is what this is what they're saying.
[03:38:27.947 --> 03:38:33.932]  They are saying they want to send a bold message to our new administration on the first day in office that women's rights are human rights.
[03:38:35.498 --> 03:38:37.260]  Is anybody disagreeing with that?
[03:38:37.260 --> 03:38:41.283]  Is there some sort of a uprising against women's rights that I'm missing?
[03:38:41.283 --> 03:38:42.224]  You're a woman.
[03:38:42.224 --> 03:38:43.525]  Am I missing something?
[03:38:43.525 --> 03:38:53.394]  Well, that goes back to the fake news where they have to put up that narrative that the Republicans don't have a plan to replace Obamacare even though they have at least six different versions of six different plans.
[03:38:53.394 --> 03:38:56.918]  But they also have to put that out there that Donald Trump is going to
[03:38:57.538 --> 03:38:57.638]  Good!
[03:38:57.638 --> 03:38:58.518]  Exclamation point!
[03:39:16.886 --> 03:39:17.447]  Exactly.
[03:39:17.447 --> 03:39:25.012]  And then if Planned Parenthood is so, you know, hard up for cash, why are they paying the leader, like, more than a million dollars a year?
[03:39:25.012 --> 03:39:30.296]  I forget her name, but they're always having these big parties with their celebrities and their celebrity endorsements.
[03:39:30.296 --> 03:39:30.876]  Here's an idea.
[03:39:30.876 --> 03:39:32.958]  How about George Soros can fund Planned Parenthood?
[03:39:32.958 --> 03:39:33.498]  How about that?
[03:39:33.498 --> 03:39:33.999]  Exactly.
[03:39:33.999 --> 03:39:35.260]  You don't need to take my money.
[03:39:35.700 --> 03:39:38.942]  Exactly, or Bill Gates, who, you know, thinks there's too many people in the world.
[03:39:38.942 --> 03:39:42.565]  He wants to vaccinate everyone five times before the first month of their life.
[03:39:42.565 --> 03:39:45.687]  So, I mean, you know, how about he funds Planned Parenthood if it's so great?
[03:39:45.687 --> 03:39:48.669]  I mean, you care about these people, Soros and Gates.
[03:39:48.669 --> 03:39:50.111]  Fund Planned Parenthood, then.
[03:39:50.111 --> 03:39:51.411]  Quit taking our money.
[03:39:51.411 --> 03:39:53.453]  That's illegal and unconstitutional to me.
[03:39:53.453 --> 03:40:00.978]  America Ferreira, she's some actress, she says, since the election, so many fear that their voices will go unheard.
[03:40:00.978 --> 03:40:02.179]  No, we're hearing you cry.
[03:40:02.179 --> 03:40:03.020]  We're just laughing.
[03:40:03.080 --> 03:40:09.882]  Well that's what's funny is that since the election the Hollywood voices are going unheard because people are just sick and tired of being lectured by these Hollywood elites.
[03:40:09.882 --> 03:40:10.843]  I can't.
[03:40:10.843 --> 03:40:26.388]  Now I know that we have another Alex Jones report that he's filed on China communism and the South China Sea and we were just discussing that and I would love to get his breakdown on that situation there if you want to.
[03:40:26.388 --> 03:40:30.069]  Alright well let's go ahead and hear what Alex has to say about the situation in the South China Sea.
[03:40:31.502 --> 03:40:34.404]  Communist China is the existential threat.
[03:40:34.404 --> 03:40:42.990]  Communist China was set up in power in 1949 by the Western powers, by the CIA, by the robber barons.
[03:40:42.990 --> 03:40:54.118]  China came out just yesterday, their official government newspaper, the People's Daily, and said, we are the champions of globalism and global government.
[03:40:54.118 --> 03:40:57.260]  We will prop up this worldwide system.
[03:40:57.260 --> 03:40:58.241]  Well, absolutely.
[03:40:58.241 --> 03:40:58.942]  They've been given
[03:40:59.602 --> 03:40:59.903]  I think?
[03:41:18.085 --> 03:41:18.305]  I think?
[03:41:40.757 --> 03:41:48.163]  It was established that they wouldn't ever expand out of their own country, and that they wouldn't dominate the South China Sea, and that they wouldn't dominate Japan.
[03:41:48.163 --> 03:41:53.147]  And that they wouldn't be a major military power, but they could have nuclear weapons to, quote, defend themselves from Russia.
[03:41:53.147 --> 03:41:57.090]  Because, believe it or not, the Chinese have a real issue with the Russians more than us.
[03:41:57.090 --> 03:41:59.551]  We kicked the Japanese out in World War II.
[03:41:59.551 --> 03:42:02.093]  Again, our government put Mao Zedong in power.
[03:42:02.093 --> 03:42:03.574]  That was declassified a decade ago.
[03:42:04.555 --> 03:42:05.716]  Actually, more than a decade ago.
[03:42:05.716 --> 03:42:06.357]  I guess 2004.
[03:42:06.357 --> 03:42:08.278]  So 12 years ago.
[03:42:08.278 --> 03:42:18.067]  And John Birch Society has been breaking that down since they were founded in the 1950s expressly on the fact that our government had sold out to the Communist Chinese.
[03:42:18.067 --> 03:42:19.488]  But that's a whole other subject.
[03:42:19.488 --> 03:42:20.889]  Just giving credit where credit is due.
[03:42:20.889 --> 03:42:22.430]  Talk about being ahead of their time.
[03:42:23.651 --> 03:42:27.855]  And so the People's Daily last year said, we'll basically have war with you.
[03:42:27.855 --> 03:42:28.555]  We'll crush you.
[03:42:28.555 --> 03:42:29.696]  We're prepared for nuclear war.
[03:42:29.696 --> 03:42:34.080]  We're prepared for wars in the South China Sea or in the Pacific period.
[03:42:34.080 --> 03:42:35.781]  We'll take back any islands we want.
[03:42:35.781 --> 03:42:37.242]  We'll invade the Philippines.
[03:42:37.242 --> 03:42:38.844]  They've been extremely belligerent.
[03:42:39.364 --> 03:42:44.747]  They've also come out and said, we're going to defend globalism as it falls apart in Europe and the United States.
[03:42:44.747 --> 03:42:46.208]  We're going to empower it.
[03:42:46.208 --> 03:42:48.909]  And the Davos group's been bragging about that, you name it.
[03:42:48.909 --> 03:42:57.174]  It's the globalists, multinationals, with China, and with the Islamicists against the rest of the world.
[03:42:57.174 --> 03:42:59.355]  The globalists double-crossed Russia as well.
[03:42:59.355 --> 03:43:04.338]  They had a deal going back to the early 1990s to not take over former
[03:43:05.419 --> 03:43:05.779]  I think?
[03:43:24.309 --> 03:43:33.759]  Massively in the last year, and really the last eight, but in the last year it has gone to the edge of war.
[03:43:33.759 --> 03:43:46.211]  So there's major jockeying, major political changes happening around the world, major realignments, but the United States under a Trump presidency is going to be realigned with the UK, countries that break away from the euro,
[03:43:47.321 --> 03:43:53.602]  With any other nations that want to work with us, with Japan and others.
[03:43:53.602 --> 03:44:02.805]  And it's China, the global bankers, the people like Soros, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the same old combine, and the Islamicists.
[03:44:02.805 --> 03:44:12.367]  It's those three groups, that's the axis of evil, against the American Republic and our own global system of free trade and free markets and open governments.
[03:44:13.027 --> 03:44:26.602]  Which was the original globalism that was being pushed by Eisenhower and others, that then got hijacked, and instead of actually putting in good governments in the Middle East and places like that, that were actually democratized and secular, by the 80s they reversed the program.
[03:44:26.602 --> 03:44:28.404]  Reagan really wasn't involved, but it happened.
[03:44:29.365 --> 03:44:40.335]  They reversed the program where they basically began to double-cross those nations and started putting actual tyrants in every time they could.
[03:44:40.335 --> 03:44:48.702]  So again, going back to Owen, the Communist Chinese are openly, constantly threatening to attack the United States.
[03:44:48.702 --> 03:44:52.145]  They are constantly threatening and talking about how they can destroy us.
[03:44:52.145 --> 03:44:53.266]  They're using North Korea
[03:44:54.006 --> 03:44:56.469]  Uh, as a go-between group as well.
[03:44:56.469 --> 03:45:00.954]  So yes, these are real threats and the American people are not made aware of them.
[03:45:00.954 --> 03:45:13.148]  What makes me angry is that they keep claiming in our news that the communist, uh, you know, you know, Chinese aren't a threat while they're making these threats and while they're expanding while telling us that Russia is the existential threat and has to be dealt with.
[03:45:13.889 --> 03:45:20.094]  It is absolutely critical that we inform our fellow Americans and other people around the world about what's happening.
[03:45:20.094 --> 03:45:25.918]  Also, leftist-controlled CNN always spins this, that we're anti-Chinese or anti-Asian.
[03:45:25.918 --> 03:45:31.622]  The Communist Chinese have killed over 100 million of their own people, 80 plus million under Mao Zedong.
[03:45:31.622 --> 03:45:31.843]  Okay?
[03:45:32.703 --> 03:45:36.706]  So, let's be clear, this is not an anti-Asian operation or anti-Chinese operation.
[03:45:36.706 --> 03:45:38.107]  They're great people.
[03:45:38.107 --> 03:45:43.632]  They are under an exploitive, enslaved system that's being used to leverage out and take control of the world.
[03:45:43.632 --> 03:45:47.254]  Donald Trump is countering that and saying no more one-sided deals.
[03:45:47.254 --> 03:45:49.696]  Americanism, not globalism.
[03:45:49.696 --> 03:45:53.920]  But it is the communist, Chinese, fascistic, crony-capitalist model.
[03:45:55.669 --> 03:46:01.645]  That is the enemy of any free, open society, and we must break its back and free the people of China.
[03:46:01.645 --> 03:46:02.708]  Back to Owen and the rest of the crew.
[03:46:03.626 --> 03:46:04.526]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:46:04.526 --> 03:46:10.949]  Now, before we went to break, we were talking about some stuff that's going on right now in D.C.
[03:46:10.949 --> 03:46:14.550]  around the inauguration, and I wanted to talk about this story.
[03:46:14.550 --> 03:46:15.750]  Commanding General of D.C.
[03:46:15.750 --> 03:46:17.271]  National Guard to be removed from post.
[03:46:17.271 --> 03:46:32.016]  Now, I was reading this story, and I was actually glad that I talked about this with Leanne before coming on air, because she actually reminded me about something that skipped my mind when I was reading this, how Trump has basically said all presidential appointments are essentially no longer effective as soon as he becomes president.
[03:46:32.056 --> 03:46:32.316]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:47:02.234 --> 03:47:11.281]  But it then goes on, and this was the part that was confusing to me, and then hearing you say what you think the reason is, and it makes sense, how come he wouldn't know this?
[03:47:11.281 --> 03:47:21.668]  He says, a quote, that he has not been told why he had to step down, and then he goes on to say, I'm a presidential nominee, therefore the president has the power to remove me.
[03:47:21.668 --> 03:47:24.630]  Do you think he's referring to Trump or Obama there?
[03:47:24.630 --> 03:47:27.752]  And do you think he knows that it was Trump's call to remove him?
[03:47:27.752 --> 03:47:29.533]  Or do you think maybe there's something else going on?
[03:47:29.533 --> 03:47:31.435]  Obviously Trump has not reached out and talked to him.
[03:47:31.795 --> 03:47:45.847]  Well yeah, was he given this order to be relieved at exactly 12.01 by President Obama who's saying, you know what, take yourself out of there and let's see how much chaos we can create when the DC National Guard doesn't have a leader in place?
[03:47:45.847 --> 03:47:52.373]  Or is it because Donald Trump put out that call that all the presidential appointees needed to go as soon as he was
[03:47:52.853 --> 03:47:53.073]  I don't
[03:48:11.172 --> 03:48:11.512]  She's nuts.
[03:48:29.543 --> 03:48:31.765]  But that's the thing, it would be the D.C.
[03:48:31.765 --> 03:48:38.192]  National Guard who would be called out to implement martial law.
[03:48:38.192 --> 03:48:42.536]  It's very interesting, we're kind of stuck there in a quagmire with what's going on.
[03:48:42.536 --> 03:48:44.919]  She is stuck in a quagmire, called her own mind.
[03:48:45.539 --> 03:48:48.501]  But it's crazy, and again, we're going to be at the inauguration.
[03:48:48.501 --> 03:48:53.805]  Make sure that you're at InfoWars.com and the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube to keep up with all of our coverage there.
[03:48:53.805 --> 03:48:56.227]  I'm sure it's going to be absolutely wild.
[03:48:56.227 --> 03:48:57.208]  But it's already getting wild.
[03:48:57.208 --> 03:48:58.249]  We're already seeing the signs of it.
[03:48:58.249 --> 03:48:58.989]  You were talking about it.
[03:48:58.989 --> 03:49:01.951]  We're expecting, I think there might be millions of people there.
[03:49:01.951 --> 03:49:03.433]  I mean, this is going to be absolutely wild.
[03:49:03.433 --> 03:49:03.933]  Well, yeah.
[03:49:04.373 --> 03:49:04.953]  L.A.
[03:49:04.953 --> 03:49:05.213]  artists.
[03:49:05.213 --> 03:49:06.314]  I don't know if you saw this, Leigh-Anne.
[03:49:06.314 --> 03:49:06.554]  L.A.
[03:49:06.554 --> 03:49:10.114]  artists creates painting in blood as a Trump protest.
[03:49:10.114 --> 03:49:19.697]  A group of artists working on a Trump protest painting have now received more than 20 pints of blood that they are using to make the painting on the wall.
[03:49:19.697 --> 03:49:20.437]  How do you like that?
[03:49:20.437 --> 03:49:21.077]  It's art.
[03:49:21.077 --> 03:49:22.597]  This isn't a spirit cooking, mind you.
[03:49:22.597 --> 03:49:23.718]  You just don't get it.
[03:49:23.718 --> 03:49:24.338]  It is art.
[03:49:24.338 --> 03:49:25.558]  This isn't a spirit cooking.
[03:49:25.558 --> 03:49:31.539]  This is cutting yourself and then painting it on a wall to protest Donald Trump.
[03:49:31.539 --> 03:49:32.380]  How about this, Leigh-Anne?
[03:49:32.380 --> 03:49:33.420]  You think this will be effective?
[03:49:34.670 --> 03:49:35.230]  What do you think?
[03:49:35.230 --> 03:49:37.251]  You think a blood painting on the wall will do anything?
[03:49:37.251 --> 03:49:38.012]  You know what you're saying?
[03:49:38.012 --> 03:49:42.094]  You know what you're saying when you're making a Trump protest painting in blood?
[03:49:42.094 --> 03:49:43.174]  You know what you're actually saying?
[03:49:43.174 --> 03:49:43.335]  What?
[03:49:43.335 --> 03:49:43.995]  I'm crazy, I need help.
[03:49:59.463 --> 03:49:59.943]  Help me!
[03:49:59.943 --> 03:50:00.883]  That's what you're saying.
[03:50:00.883 --> 03:50:02.564]  Nothing more, nothing less.
[03:50:02.564 --> 03:50:04.104]  I'm insane and I need help.
[03:50:04.104 --> 03:50:09.945]  Well, they're willing to draw a little blood with these mass riots and these protests that they're planning.
[03:50:09.945 --> 03:50:19.228]  Well, and then there was someone, one of the major organizers of a protest, was asked about violence and he was basically kind of saying, you know, we're not condoning it, but you know, it's gonna happen.
[03:50:19.228 --> 03:50:20.348]  So, okay, good for you.
[03:50:20.888 --> 03:50:22.750]  They hope to stop his swearing in.
[03:50:22.750 --> 03:50:24.171]  Here's what I would hope for you, though.
[03:50:24.171 --> 03:50:33.919]  I would hope that you don't plant any violence around the Bikers for Trump, because most of those guys are probably some big bad dudes who you don't want to mess with.
[03:50:33.919 --> 03:50:36.441]  Bikers for Trump vow to defend Trump inauguration.
[03:50:36.441 --> 03:50:38.944]  They are going to form a wall of protection.
[03:50:38.944 --> 03:50:44.588]  Chris Cox, Biker for Trump founder, has said that this is their plan during Trump's inauguration.
[03:50:44.588 --> 03:50:45.309]  I can't wait.
[03:50:45.309 --> 03:50:46.890]  I'm excited to see the Bikers for Trump.
[03:50:47.891 --> 03:50:51.955]  I hope maybe a couple of them want to form a wall around me, because I have a feeling that I'm going to be a target.
[03:50:51.955 --> 03:50:56.941]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show, on the other side, Owen Shroyer, Lianne McAdoo with you for five more minutes.
[03:51:00.370 --> 03:51:03.593]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America?
[03:51:03.593 --> 03:51:07.678]  Because of what we did on this day, change has come to America.
[03:51:07.678 --> 03:51:10.300]  Something's wrong, and we all know it.
[03:51:10.300 --> 03:51:13.123]  I'm Charlie Daniels, and I'm here to tell you about it.
[03:51:13.123 --> 03:51:18.289]  The nation has been hijacked by international forces, bent on global governance.
[03:51:18.769 --> 03:51:25.018]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[03:51:25.018 --> 03:51:31.247]  God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[03:51:31.247 --> 03:51:33.811]  Revelation, dawn of global government.

[03:52:08.753 --> 03:52:18.800]  So why are you messing around with generic razors that cost $32 for an 8-pack, when you can shave with Harry's high-quality German-engineered blades for half the price?

[03:54:03.027 --> 03:54:09.658]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:54:09.658 --> 03:54:12.623]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:54:16.829 --> 03:54:19.611]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, fourth hour, final segment.
[03:54:19.611 --> 03:54:21.933]  Owen Schroer, LeeAnne McAdoo with you.
[03:54:21.933 --> 03:54:29.278]  And in case you haven't heard, we have some amazing body armor available right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:54:29.278 --> 03:54:35.823]  The most advanced body armor on the market right now, and it is being sold at a ridiculous price.
[03:54:35.823 --> 03:54:43.009]  This is some of the lightest, most comfortable body armor that you can find on the market, and it's also some of the strongest, too.
[03:54:43.889 --> 03:54:50.233]  And it's amazing to think that you might need something like this, but this is the times that we live in, obviously.
[03:54:50.233 --> 03:54:54.296]  You know, it's amazing, you know, this shooting that just happened at the Fort Lauderdale Airport.
[03:54:54.296 --> 03:55:06.683]  You talk about, you know, David talks about getting that, the backpack body armor that we have that's just basically a flat shield that you can put in the backpack to protect your child if they're at the airport or a school shooting.
[03:55:06.683 --> 03:55:10.646]  We've obviously, you know, seen these things happen in the past.
[03:55:11.466 --> 03:55:22.698]  But it's amazing, you know, we live in these times where you might need body armor and I was just thinking about this, how that whole Fort Lauderdale shooting kind of just ended up being a 24-hour news cycle story.
[03:55:22.698 --> 03:55:30.827]  But there's a reason why people want to get body armor like this, because they want to be able to wear it, they want it to be practical, but they want it to protect them.
[03:55:30.827 --> 03:55:31.948]  They want it to save their life.
[03:55:32.549 --> 03:55:34.612]  And that's what this body armor can do for you.
[03:55:34.612 --> 03:55:39.918]  Again, this is some of the most advanced body armor that you can find at the best price.
[03:55:39.918 --> 03:55:42.000]  Protect yourself, protect your children.
[03:55:42.000 --> 03:55:43.322]  Go check it out.
[03:55:43.322 --> 03:55:44.483]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:55:44.483 --> 03:55:45.644]  Check out that body armor.
[03:55:45.644 --> 03:55:50.170]  I promise you, just like the DNA Force, soon they'll be talking about this as groundbreaking.
[03:55:50.170 --> 03:55:51.111]  Well, we broke it first.
[03:55:51.591 --> 03:55:55.113]  That backpack could also be really good during these protests coming up too.
[03:55:55.113 --> 03:55:55.493]  You know what?
[03:55:55.493 --> 03:55:56.094]  I'm glad you said that.
[03:55:56.094 --> 03:56:01.577]  Protect all of your equipment there from any of the gas canisters that might be fired at protesters.
[03:56:01.577 --> 03:56:02.778]  Or who else?
[03:56:02.778 --> 03:56:08.521]  A lot of journalists out there might need... I'm going to have to wear a helmet going to this thing.
[03:56:08.521 --> 03:56:10.182]  My goodness, it's going to be crazy.
[03:56:11.061 --> 03:56:13.222]  Alright, what do we want to finish off with?
[03:56:13.222 --> 03:56:14.222]  Let's see, Leanne.
[03:56:14.222 --> 03:56:15.762]  Oh, actually, I wanted to mention this.
[03:56:15.762 --> 03:56:17.363]  It is now official.
[03:56:17.363 --> 03:56:27.045]  The House has joined the Senate in approving the 2017 budget blueprint, the first step towards dismantling the Affordable Care Act.
[03:56:27.045 --> 03:56:28.205]  So there you go, it's now final.
[03:56:28.205 --> 03:56:30.366]  They've held the vote on both sides.
[03:56:30.366 --> 03:56:34.447]  Nanny nanny boo boo, liberal tears, we'll water my garden for the entire year.
[03:56:34.707 --> 03:56:35.689]  I'm a little bittersweet.
[03:56:35.689 --> 03:56:45.468]  I saw Rand Paul standing up against that and just being very disappointed with how much debt that is going to levy to the American taxpayer with that budget.
[03:56:46.514 --> 03:56:49.035]  Well, unfortunately... Maybe we'll talk a little more about that on the Nightly News tonight.
[03:56:49.035 --> 03:57:00.178]  Unfortunately, that debt is so out of control and it's going to take more than just one aspect of government spending to reel that problem... Pints of our blood?
[03:57:00.178 --> 03:57:04.380]  20 pints of blood for an anti-Trump protest that says nothing more than I'm crazy?
[03:57:04.380 --> 03:57:05.260]  Good luck with that.
[03:57:05.260 --> 03:57:09.961]  Hey, wasn't Whoopi Goldberg supposed to leave the country if Donald Trump won?
[03:57:09.961 --> 03:57:11.742]  Unfortunately, I think she's still here.
[03:57:12.562 --> 03:57:15.365]  And she's decided to open her big mouth again.
[03:57:15.365 --> 03:57:19.710]  Whoopi Goldberg isn't here for Kanye West's recent comments.
[03:57:19.710 --> 03:57:21.611]  Calls him an idiot boy.
[03:57:21.611 --> 03:57:27.738]  So now Whoopi Goldberg is calling out Kanye West for Trumping while black.
[03:57:27.738 --> 03:57:34.765]  And again, I'm pretty sure Whoopi Goldberg was one of the celebrities who said they would leave the country if Trump won.
[03:57:35.712 --> 03:57:37.814]  Yeah, there she is right there.
[03:57:37.814 --> 03:57:39.475]  Aww, poor little Whoopi.
[03:57:39.475 --> 03:57:42.237]  I guess things are better in America after all.
[03:57:42.237 --> 03:57:44.459]  Aren't things nice in America after all, Whoopi?
[03:57:44.459 --> 03:57:51.084]  We had Steve Harvey actually just left the Trump Tower and said he had a great meeting with him and he thinks that he's the real deal.
[03:57:51.084 --> 03:57:55.528]  So I think there's a lot of people out there that are not afraid of Trumping while black.
[03:57:55.528 --> 03:58:00.372]  And that's the thing too, is once these people meet Trump and speak to him, they're like, oh the media was lying, this is actually a nice guy.
[03:58:00.672 --> 03:58:01.492]  Here you go, though.
[03:58:01.492 --> 03:58:02.432]  Burning memorabilia.
[03:58:02.432 --> 03:58:05.193]  The Chargers are now leaving Chicago.
[03:58:05.193 --> 03:58:07.713]  And what are football fans in San Diego doing?
[03:58:07.713 --> 03:58:09.654]  They're burning all their memorabilia.
[03:58:09.654 --> 03:58:15.655]  These people care more about losing their football team than losing their country, their freedom, or their future.
[03:58:15.655 --> 03:58:17.355]  This is what needs to change in this country.
[03:58:17.355 --> 03:58:18.435]  Thank you, Leanne.
[03:58:18.435 --> 03:58:19.136]  Thank you, David Knight.
[03:58:19.136 --> 03:58:19.796]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:58:19.796 --> 03:58:21.176]  Thank you to the entire crew.
[03:58:21.176 --> 03:58:23.256]  The Alex Jones Show will be back next Monday.
[03:58:23.256 --> 03:58:25.177]  It's Inauguration Week next week, folks.
[03:58:25.177 --> 03:58:25.957]  Nightly News Tonight, 7 p.m.
[03:58:29.676 --> 03:58:30.058]  Oh yeah.
