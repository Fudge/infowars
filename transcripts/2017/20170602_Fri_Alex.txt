[00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:57.445]  In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord.
[00:00:57.445 --> 00:01:03.149]  Thank you.
[00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.469]  Thank you.
[00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:17.798]  But begin negotiations to reenter either the Paris Accord or in really entirely new transaction.
[00:01:17.798 --> 00:01:27.661]  On terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
[00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:30.342]  So we're getting out.
[00:01:30.342 --> 00:01:31.842]  But we will start to negotiate
[00:01:33.308 --> 00:01:35.649]  And we will see if we can make a deal that's fair.
[00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.270]  And if we can, that's great.
[00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.991]  And if we can't, that's fine.
[00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:50.933]  As President, I can put no other consideration before the well-being of American citizens.
[00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:59.816]  The Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United States.
[00:02:01.328 --> 00:02:22.317]  To the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American workers, who I love, and taxpayers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly diminished economic production.
[00:02:22.317 --> 00:02:30.861]  Thus, as of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord.
[00:02:32.432 --> 00:02:40.754]  And the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.
[00:02:40.754 --> 00:02:58.719]  This includes ending the implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund, which is costing the United States a vast fortune.
[00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:24.502]  Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the owner's energy restrictions that is placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025, according to the National Economic Research Associates.
[00:03:24.502 --> 00:03:30.003]  This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs, not what we need.
[00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:31.964]  Believe me, this is not what we need.
[00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:47.921]  Including automobile jobs and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely.
[00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:54.066]  They rely for so much and we would be giving them so little.
[00:03:54.066 --> 00:04:03.193]  According to the same study by 2040, compliance with the commitments put into place by the previous administration
[00:04:03.945 --> 00:04:08.629]  Would cut production for the following sectors.
[00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:09.750]  Paper, down 12%.
[00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.310]  Cement, down 23%.
[00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.133]  Iron and steel, down 38%.
[00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:18.076]  Coal, and I happen to love the coal miners, down 86%.
[00:04:32.853 --> 00:04:34.034]  Natural gas down 31%.
[00:04:34.034 --> 00:04:54.486]  The cost to the economy at this time would be close to $3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million industrial jobs, while households would have $7,000 less income, and in many cases,
[00:04:57.535 --> 00:04:59.096]  Much worse than that.
[00:04:59.096 --> 00:04:59.876]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.876 --> 00:05:02.337]  Kathy Griffin started her idiotic press conference.
[00:05:02.337 --> 00:05:06.198]  Bilderberg 2017 is kicking off in Chantilly, Virginia this year.
[00:05:06.198 --> 00:05:11.841]  This is the first Bilderberg meeting since the populist uprisings of Brexit and the Trump election have come to pass.
[00:05:11.841 --> 00:05:15.722]  And the elites now see their power base crumbling before their very eyes.
[00:05:15.722 --> 00:05:19.964]  Among some of the subjects of the secret confab will be the Trump administration.
[00:05:19.964 --> 00:05:21.284]  And can he be healed?
[00:05:21.284 --> 00:05:23.305]  Also the rise of populism.
[00:05:23.305 --> 00:05:25.346]  Elites are beginning to fear that their power base
[00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:26.547]  May be crumbling.
[00:05:26.547 --> 00:05:30.309]  Now, three members of the current Trump administration are going to be attending.
[00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:33.431]  HR McMaster, Wilbur Ross, and Chris Liddell.
[00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:39.355]  Most Trump insiders believe that these three are there to help the elites derail the current administration.
[00:05:39.355 --> 00:05:41.056]  There are two ways in which this can go.
[00:05:41.056 --> 00:05:43.037]  Either the globals will try to bring Trump to heel,
[00:05:43.257 --> 00:05:46.018]  Or they will try to impeach him after the 2018 election.
[00:05:46.018 --> 00:05:51.140]  You can read more about this and exclusive Bilderberg schemes to overthrow Trump on InfoWars.com.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.341]  And ask yourself, what are you doing to wake up minds?
[00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:56.662]  Spread this link and help wake up some minds.
[00:05:56.662 --> 00:05:59.964]  Rob Deere reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:06:01.084 --> 00:06:15.431]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:06:15.431 --> 00:06:18.253]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:22.235]  It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[00:06:22.235 --> 00:06:28.418]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because
[00:06:28.618 --> 00:06:34.562]  We want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.
[00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:39.586]  We have over a thousand high-quality products available that are discounted at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:06:39.586 --> 00:06:42.508]  You add AutoShip, several of these are lost leaders.
[00:06:42.508 --> 00:06:44.709]  65% off cloyal silver.
[00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:48.352]  You sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off and lock in the price.
[00:06:48.692 --> 00:06:50.213]  Supermail, 30% off.
[00:06:50.213 --> 00:06:52.594]  Add the 10% off for auto ship, that's 40% off.
[00:06:52.594 --> 00:07:00.857]  These are our Memorial Day specials as we remember the fallen in defense of this republic, the true trailblazers on which all of us stand.
[00:07:00.857 --> 00:07:02.778]  Embrics to Centrals, that's my middle name.
[00:07:02.778 --> 00:07:04.359]  I've spent seven years
[00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:15.226]  Off and on, trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:24.373]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[00:07:24.373 --> 00:07:28.996]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[00:07:28.996 --> 00:07:31.418]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman,
[00:07:31.838 --> 00:07:36.119]  20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:37.259]  It's all there.
[00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:42.700]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:53.423]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:07:53.423 --> 00:07:56.043]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[00:07:56.043 --> 00:08:00.104]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emrix Essentials.
[00:08:11.934 --> 00:08:16.735]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:08:16.735 --> 00:08:22.816]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.816 --> 00:08:27.337]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:08:41.132 --> 00:08:42.154]  Here we are, June 2nd, 2017.
[00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:43.996]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:43.996 --> 00:08:46.781]  We're going to be here live for the next four hours.
[00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:56.815]  Our reporters are on the ground in Chantilly, Virginia, where the globalists are encamped, secretly meeting in Bilderberg to admittedly plot the overthrow of President Trump.
[00:08:57.396 --> 00:09:00.917]  We know many of the attendees have publicly said they want to overthrow Trump.
[00:09:00.917 --> 00:09:04.378]  It's on the agenda that they want to, quote, deal with Trump.
[00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:14.480]  And so from our moles, Paul Watson's writing a story right now, we know their main agenda, both from our intel and from what is publicly being put out.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:23.262]  What Trump did yesterday, pulling out of the carbon tax, the global taxing system over carbon dioxide, one of the four
[00:09:24.668 --> 00:09:41.677]  Elements needed for life on this planet, water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and of course sunlight, was an absolute, total declaration of war against the austerity producing system of the globalists.
[00:09:41.677 --> 00:09:48.000]  And then, he walked through the complete and total, abject, massive fraud.
[00:09:50.549 --> 00:09:58.374]  That is, the entire anthropogenic, warming, cooling, change line.
[00:09:58.374 --> 00:10:01.756]  Which sets the globalists up as the saviors of the earth.
[00:10:01.756 --> 00:10:06.579]  And they need to regulate and control every facet of your life.
[00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:15.224]  And if you don't let them do that, if you don't let them control your life, if you don't let them save you, if you don't let them regulate and tax you, well then you're gonna die.
[00:10:15.224 --> 00:10:16.285]  That's what a kidnapper says.
[00:10:16.285 --> 00:10:17.886]  Get in the car, I'm gonna shoot ya.
[00:10:21.089 --> 00:10:26.011]  Don't scream, don't resist, little girl, little boy, or I'll hurt you.
[00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:32.153]  But the truth is, if you get in the white creeper van, you know what really ends up happening.
[00:10:32.153 --> 00:10:36.815]  You know you end up getting taken to a basement or a shack and tortured to death.
[00:10:36.815 --> 00:10:41.296]  And that's basically what globalism is in slow motion, is the end of humanity.
[00:10:41.296 --> 00:10:46.158]  But the fact that it's been exposed, the fact that it's out in the open, there's no way to put it back together again.
[00:10:46.158 --> 00:10:46.798]  Trump, in a 45-minute speech,
[00:10:49.343 --> 00:10:53.384]  I guess if you count Pence, it was about 45 minutes.
[00:10:53.384 --> 00:10:56.685]  A 35-minute speech.
[00:10:56.685 --> 00:10:57.705]  Total Veritas.
[00:10:57.705 --> 00:11:02.126]  He just devastated it, lock, stock and barrel, from pillar to post.
[00:11:02.126 --> 00:11:06.967]  But the key was, not even arguing with science all day, because they'll debate that.
[00:11:06.967 --> 00:11:13.248]  China and India and 160-plus other third world and developing nations have zero environmental cuts.
[00:11:13.248 --> 00:11:15.789]  They run dirty plants, not clean plants like ours.
[00:11:17.793 --> 00:11:19.674]  That's why there's not restrictions on mercury.
[00:11:19.674 --> 00:11:22.657]  I want it totally banned coming out of a smokestack.
[00:11:22.657 --> 00:11:25.159]  Or carbon dust or whatever.
[00:11:25.159 --> 00:11:32.665]  No, it was carbon dioxide and water vapor is what comes out of the top of our clean stacks.
[00:11:32.665 --> 00:11:40.451]  And then the distillation in the scrubbers, those big buildings you see built on that look like mini cities to the coal plants.
[00:11:42.523 --> 00:11:44.384]  Those are the scrubbers.
[00:11:44.384 --> 00:11:53.066]  And they're creating distillates for alloys, and steel, and plastics, and material for your highways, and just, it all gets used.
[00:11:53.066 --> 00:11:54.046]  It all gets used.
[00:11:54.046 --> 00:12:04.629]  That's what our incredible scientists in Germany, in France, in England, in the United States, in Scotland, and in other areas of the world, the Japanese have developed a lot of stuff.
[00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:07.730]  That's what the technology has deployed.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:24.129]  And now, Trump, with one fell swoop, has come in and not just said, oh, you know, this deal isn't the best for us, or oh, you know, the science isn't proven.
[00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:37.959]  He said it's a total fraud, meant to sell out our country and de-industrialize us, because the globalists have made deals with China and others, and this is all part of a larger global government plan to render the United States basically impotent and servile.
[00:12:39.608 --> 00:12:42.471]  And Trump said, we're getting out.
[00:12:42.471 --> 00:12:44.893]  He said, I'm all for clean energy here in the United States.
[00:12:44.893 --> 00:12:48.417]  But is clean energy something that doesn't put out carbon dioxide?
[00:12:48.417 --> 00:12:50.379]  They're also saying, oh, he's wrong on the science.
[00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:57.706]  He doesn't know what a big deal a 0.2 increase in temperature is.
[00:12:59.815 --> 00:13:03.377]  Or what a tenth of a percent increase in carbon dioxide is.
[00:13:03.377 --> 00:13:16.745]  Ladies and gentlemen, carbon dioxide, according to ice cores and mud samples and others, you can look this up yourself, has been over 1,000 times higher than it was now back, say, during the Jurassic period.
[00:13:18.066 --> 00:13:25.151]  But we know, just going back to mud samples from 20-30,000 years ago, that it was 50-60 times, depending on what period.
[00:13:25.151 --> 00:13:35.438]  The truth is, most real climatologists are seriously concerned about why the Earth is at the lowest level of carbon dioxide ever recorded, going back about 100 years ago.
[00:13:35.438 --> 00:13:40.622]  It's boosted because of the Industrial Revolution a tiny bit, but almost unreadable.
[00:13:43.482 --> 00:14:01.714]  It's almost like God put all this carbon in the earth so that I guess right around the time our species developed that then we would have access to the carbon we need to basically terraform our own planet or geoengineer it right as we were losing our atmosphere.
[00:14:01.714 --> 00:14:03.955]  And Mars lost its atmosphere.
[00:14:03.955 --> 00:14:08.018]  They've confirmed there's water under the surface, big rivers, big valleys.
[00:14:08.018 --> 00:14:09.739]  It was covered with water.
[00:14:09.739 --> 00:14:11.760]  Now it only has a small southern and northern ice cap.
[00:14:13.433 --> 00:14:15.254]  Ice caps.
[00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:28.325]  I was sitting there with a family member this morning, because I'd been out in the street carrying the trash cans out, and the neighbor had come over and said, what do you think of Trump pulling out of the climate accord?
[00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:31.547]  A lot of people are upset.
[00:14:31.547 --> 00:14:36.631]  And I said, well, it's nothing but a global tax, and it's not fairly apportioned.
[00:14:36.631 --> 00:14:37.672]  Only the West has to do it.
[00:14:38.831 --> 00:14:42.375]  And they said, yes, but aren't you worried about rising temperatures?
[00:14:42.375 --> 00:14:53.045]  And I said, do you remember how it used to be there's going to be an ice age in the 80s, then it's going to be global warming in the 90s and 2000s, and now it's just climate change?
[00:14:53.045 --> 00:14:56.369]  And they didn't seem to get that either.
[00:14:56.369 --> 00:15:01.494]  So I sat there and I said, oh, I see you have your smartphone in your top pocket.
[00:15:01.494 --> 00:15:02.575]  Do me a favor, type in
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.422]  Ice caps have gotten larger, or Antarctic has gotten larger.
[00:15:10.422 --> 00:15:12.763]  He typed it in.
[00:15:12.763 --> 00:15:13.823]  We can do this right now.
[00:15:13.823 --> 00:15:18.045]  Let's do this on Google, or Bing, or whatever we want to use.
[00:15:18.045 --> 00:15:21.587]  Just type in, Antarctic ice caps at record level.
[00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.888]  And you know what the top two links are?
[00:15:23.888 --> 00:15:27.969]  It's NASA.
[00:15:27.969 --> 00:15:31.911]  And it's shots of the Antarctic.
[00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:33.892]  And it shows that it's grown the most ever.
[00:15:37.805 --> 00:15:42.089]  And it shows that it is expanding and it's thicker than ever recorded.
[00:15:42.089 --> 00:15:47.914]  Now that was the first article I sent Nico this morning and asked him to have the guys post on InfoWars.
[00:15:47.914 --> 00:15:50.316]  Because that's the first link if you're watching us on TV.
[00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:51.517]  Let's go back to the top.
[00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:59.584]  The first link if you type in is flashback NASA study mass gains in Arctic ice sheet greater than losses.
[00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:00.805]  That was 2015.
[00:16:00.805 --> 00:16:01.105]  NASA.gov.
[00:16:06.121 --> 00:16:17.027]  But there's another report from the same year, another one the next year, Antarctic Ice Sheet, the largest it's ever been recorded.
[00:16:17.027 --> 00:16:20.489]  That's the second link in the NASA file.
[00:16:20.489 --> 00:16:23.610]  And by the way, these are temperature readings from satellites.
[00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.812]  These are temperature readings from the ground.
[00:16:25.812 --> 00:16:29.754]  These are space scans.
[00:16:29.754 --> 00:16:31.215]  These are ground scans.
[00:16:31.215 --> 00:16:32.895]  These are scans from aircraft.
[00:16:32.895 --> 00:16:33.376]  And this is
[00:16:34.591 --> 00:16:48.616]  Topography scans down to a millimeter showing how the continent of Antarctica has grown at record levels and they have time-lapse satellite composites of it growing.
[00:16:48.616 --> 00:16:52.798]  Now by 2013, in 2006, Al Gore said it was going to be melted.
[00:16:52.798 --> 00:16:56.619]  And look, they know this is all a fraud.
[00:16:56.619 --> 00:16:57.760]  There it is.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.721]  Antarctic sea ice reaches new record maximum.
[00:17:02.415 --> 00:17:04.596]  Record maximum!
[00:17:04.596 --> 00:17:07.517]  The year after Al Gore said it would melt.
[00:17:07.517 --> 00:17:10.578]  By the way, those are old articles.
[00:17:10.578 --> 00:17:21.381]  Antarctic is growing even faster now and may, they're worried, touch the tip of South America for parts of the year and close the sea lanes.
[00:17:21.381 --> 00:17:31.805]  That's right, that's never been recorded where the sea lanes between the tip of South America, Chile, and Antarctica, the southern continent,
[00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:40.191]  The no man's land, no nation makes claim to it, kind of like Mars or the moon, might as well be.
[00:17:40.191 --> 00:17:54.054]  It's growing so fast that in some months of the winter it is feared that by February or April of next year it could seal the southern passage.
[00:17:56.329 --> 00:18:05.133]  But see, Al Gore is brainwashing your kids with movies he makes showing cartoon graphics of polar bears drowning.
[00:18:05.133 --> 00:18:11.696]  Polar bears that can't swim when their numbers are up five-fold from 1954.
[00:18:11.696 --> 00:18:13.357]  Look it up yourself.
[00:18:13.357 --> 00:18:14.358]  You can search that as well.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.584]  So this entire world government fiasco by the Rothschild, N.M.
[00:18:20.584 --> 00:18:28.150]  Rothschild Bank and the globalists to set up global 100 trillion per decade carbon taxes to track and trace everything we do.
[00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:33.935]  Trump comes out and annihilates it.
[00:18:33.935 --> 00:18:36.637]  But then I had another debate with somebody today in my family.
[00:18:39.039 --> 00:18:39.959]  They were really concerned.
[00:18:39.959 --> 00:18:45.881]  They said, well, yeah, I mean, I understand that, you know, they're cutting some carbon here, but not in other countries, but shouldn't we do something?
[00:18:45.881 --> 00:18:50.083]  And I said, it doesn't do anything when carbon dioxide is what we need.
[00:18:50.083 --> 00:18:58.186]  And when the real threat is GMO, genetic engineering, chimeras, nuclear weapons, fish infusion, hadron reactors, strangelets.
[00:19:00.126 --> 00:19:02.588]  Anti-matter weapons, which they admit the Pentagon's developed.
[00:19:02.588 --> 00:19:05.891]  It's those laboratories that you've got to worry about.
[00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:07.032]  And I'm not against technology.
[00:19:07.032 --> 00:19:11.956]  I'm saying we're moving towards the Atlantean moment where we create technology so powerful and don't know what we're doing.
[00:19:11.956 --> 00:19:21.223]  Instead of blowing up the laboratory with a, you know, chemistry test, you blow up a whole continent, or maybe the whole world, or the whole solar system.
[00:19:21.223 --> 00:19:22.684]  Who knows?
[00:19:22.684 --> 00:19:25.587]  1900 equations that gave us atomic bombs in 1945.
[00:19:28.359 --> 00:19:30.420]  Who knows what they've got now?
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.442]  That's this whole breakaway civilization issue!
[00:19:32.442 --> 00:19:40.387]  Alright, when I come back, we've got our reporters at Bilderberg.
[00:19:40.387 --> 00:19:41.888]  We've got James Leslie Rawls, the big news.
[00:19:41.888 --> 00:19:43.168]  James O'Keefe's being sued.
[00:19:43.168 --> 00:19:48.612]  Remember he exposed the Democrats admitting how they were going to engage in election theft and stuff.
[00:19:48.612 --> 00:19:50.673]  Well, they're just suing him now.
[00:19:50.673 --> 00:19:51.734]  I guess that's a message to anybody.
[00:19:51.734 --> 00:19:53.495]  Don't expose what we're doing or we'll sue you.
[00:19:53.495 --> 00:19:54.796]  Mike Cernovich has got big news.
[00:19:56.263 --> 00:19:57.664]  George Webb and more.
[00:19:57.664 --> 00:19:58.766]  So much today.
[00:19:58.766 --> 00:20:00.948]  I'm Alex Jones, Infowars.com.
[00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.791]  Nearly one third of FBI domestic terrorism cases involve refugees.
[00:20:05.791 --> 00:20:06.671]  One third.
[00:20:06.671 --> 00:20:08.692]  There's already been riots across Europe.
[00:20:08.692 --> 00:20:09.892]  Is America next?
[00:20:09.892 --> 00:20:12.173]  Hi, I'm the owner of Infidel Body Armor.
[00:20:12.173 --> 00:20:17.374]  Over the past four years, I've sold thousands of body armor kits and trained hundreds of sheepdogs.
[00:20:17.374 --> 00:20:18.315]  They have prepared.
[00:20:18.315 --> 00:20:19.715]  Have you?
[00:20:19.715 --> 00:20:24.376]  I invite you to go to my website at infidelbodyarmor.com and click on specials.
[00:20:24.376 --> 00:20:25.537]  Trouble is coming.

[00:20:27.057 --> 00:20:30.098]  Infidelbodyarmor.com just won't quit.
[00:20:31.036 --> 00:20:34.837]  Be prepared for the next disaster with the ShelterPod.
[00:20:34.837 --> 00:20:38.899]  The ShelterPod is a large, all-season, heavy-duty, quick-deploy shelter.

[00:20:46.462 --> 00:20:48.543]  Are you prepared to take care of your family?

[00:21:00.647 --> 00:21:14.933]  In America's 240 plus year history we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today fight their hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:21:14.933 --> 00:21:17.734]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[00:21:17.734 --> 00:21:21.675]  It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[00:21:21.675 --> 00:21:27.818]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because
[00:21:28.038 --> 00:21:33.962]  We want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.
[00:21:33.962 --> 00:21:38.965]  We have over a thousand high-quality products available that are discounted at m4restore.com.

[00:21:51.892 --> 00:22:00.136]  These are our Memorial Day specials as we remember the fallen in defense of this republic, the true trailblazers on which all of us stand.
[00:22:00.136 --> 00:22:05.259]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance.
[00:22:05.259 --> 00:22:10.961]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:13.283]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[00:22:16.144 --> 00:22:18.105]  Choose from three health-sharing programs.

[00:22:20.486 --> 00:22:21.426]  See guidelines.
[00:22:21.426 --> 00:22:24.708]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[00:22:24.708 --> 00:22:26.668]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:22:26.668 --> 00:22:29.970]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.850]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:35.072]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[00:22:35.072 --> 00:22:36.692]  Savory and delicious.
[00:22:36.692 --> 00:22:39.514]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:22:39.514 --> 00:22:40.174]  Awesome.
[00:22:40.174 --> 00:22:43.275]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[00:22:43.275 --> 00:22:44.836]  NASA PAC Technology.
[00:22:44.836 --> 00:22:45.196]  Bacon.
[00:22:45.436 --> 00:22:51.017]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon, or warm and served.
[00:22:51.017 --> 00:22:53.078]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:22:53.078 --> 00:22:55.018]  10-year shelf life bacon.
[00:22:55.018 --> 00:22:57.799]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com.
[00:22:57.799 --> 00:22:59.739]  FullyCookedBacon.com.
[00:22:59.739 --> 00:23:04.200]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.801]  Those times may be near.
[00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:06.361]  Think about it.
[00:23:06.701 --> 00:23:11.324]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[00:23:11.324 --> 00:23:16.306]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[00:23:16.306 --> 00:23:22.130]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:28.873]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[00:23:28.873 --> 00:23:31.415]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[00:23:31.855 --> 00:23:34.658]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.
[00:23:34.658 --> 00:23:38.161]  Get a 4-week survival food supply for only $99.

[00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:19.965]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:19.965 --> 00:24:30.752]  I want to get into what Trump's historic speech and actions mean yesterday, directing the federal agencies to stop enforcing the Paris Climate Accord.
[00:24:32.298 --> 00:24:38.184]  Which Obama has been enforcing since he got into office.
[00:24:38.184 --> 00:24:42.509]  Obama couldn't get Congress to ratify the carbon taxes.
[00:24:42.509 --> 00:24:46.072]  The first year and the second year he got in, he failed.
[00:24:46.072 --> 00:24:50.297]  But then the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency
[00:24:52.093 --> 00:24:57.494]  Could implement basically anything it wanted through executive orders of the president outside of law.
[00:24:57.494 --> 00:25:01.395]  Or that they could basically make extra legislative law.
[00:25:01.395 --> 00:25:02.776]  Their own new branch of government.
[00:25:02.776 --> 00:25:08.457]  A second legislative system.
[00:25:08.457 --> 00:25:14.259]  And so, for seven years, we've been under de facto carbon taxes.
[00:25:16.596 --> 00:25:17.757]  But they're not fully implemented.
[00:25:17.757 --> 00:25:20.779]  They could just shut down your coal plant, but not shut down GE.
[00:25:20.779 --> 00:25:23.880]  So, GE would make more money, they would give more campaign contributions.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:30.845]  Or, they could send regulators to your factory, but not to somebody else's that made the payoffs.
[00:25:30.845 --> 00:25:38.169]  Remember right when Obama got elected, there were Chevy dealerships all over the country that were Republican donors?
[00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:44.113]  And so Obama, once the government took over, General Motors literally took
[00:25:45.114 --> 00:25:51.980]  Hundreds and hundreds of dealerships away, and gave them to Democrats.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:26:00.247]  I mean, think of the mobster, gangster, third world, pickin' winners, pickin' losers system.
[00:26:00.247 --> 00:26:02.529]  That's what wrecked Venezuela.
[00:26:02.529 --> 00:26:04.551]  That's what wrecked Argentina.
[00:26:04.551 --> 00:26:05.832]  That's what wrecked Nigeria.
[00:26:07.213 --> 00:26:10.814]  Because once you get a country that operates like that, it's over.
[00:26:10.814 --> 00:26:12.795]  That's what's been wrecking Russia forever.
[00:26:12.795 --> 00:26:15.275]  And Putin, to his credit, has been trying to stop that.
[00:26:15.275 --> 00:26:17.096]  And bring in free market.
[00:26:17.096 --> 00:26:19.037]  And that's why the globalists want to shut Russia down.
[00:26:19.037 --> 00:26:26.499]  Because if Russia ever brings in real free market, they got two Americas to deal with.
[00:26:26.499 --> 00:26:35.142]  You turn the entrepreneur loose, you turn real competition loose, you get more choices, you get falling prices, you get spoiled rotten kids.
[00:26:35.142 --> 00:26:36.022]  That's the problem.
[00:26:37.506 --> 00:26:40.168]  Prosperity makes monsters.
[00:26:40.168 --> 00:26:42.109]  Adversity makes men.
[00:26:42.109 --> 00:26:44.730]  So it's a paradox.
[00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.512]  But you can argue, well, they've had a lot of adversity in Venezuela, they should be really free now.
[00:26:48.512 --> 00:26:50.693]  Well, it's a cycle.
[00:26:50.693 --> 00:26:54.696]  And a lot of countries never get out of the cycle.
[00:26:54.696 --> 00:27:04.181]  But you look at millennials, smart, focused in many cases, but they just can't handle criticism.
[00:27:08.988 --> 00:27:12.890]  We all spoil our children too much, don't we?
[00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:16.352]  Hell, I'm spoiled compared to a lot of my ancestors.
[00:27:16.352 --> 00:27:21.794]  But Trump is a throwback, and it's just trying to bring back basic competition, and that's why they're so angry.
[00:27:21.794 --> 00:27:28.998]  This devastated world government so bad, it makes my head spin.
[00:27:28.998 --> 00:27:32.680]  Here's an NBC headline the left is bandying about.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:38.323]  Did Trump, Kushner and Sessions have an undisclosed meeting with a Russian?
[00:27:40.313 --> 00:27:42.997]  Oh my gosh.
[00:27:42.997 --> 00:27:47.103]  Al Franken, the comedian, has got some more fiction for us.
[00:27:47.103 --> 00:27:48.906]  There's a Mayflower Hotel.
[00:27:48.906 --> 00:27:52.110]  They're trying to say Trump was in the hotel at the same time at some big...
[00:27:53.135 --> 00:27:55.817]  dinner convention and that that's an undisclosed meeting.
[00:27:55.817 --> 00:27:58.719]  Kind of like they go, oh, Sessions got caught lying.
[00:27:58.719 --> 00:28:06.084]  He didn't put on his forms for national security clearance, which he already had in the Senate, as Attorney General, that he met with the Russian ambassador.
[00:28:06.084 --> 00:28:08.666]  Because the FBI told him, you don't put that on the form.
[00:28:08.666 --> 00:28:09.726]  You're a separate branch of government.
[00:28:09.726 --> 00:28:14.069]  Of course, you're on the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees.
[00:28:14.069 --> 00:28:20.414]  You don't fill that out because it's not a connection to a foreign power because it's under your job.
[00:28:22.449 --> 00:28:23.489]  But they put that out.
[00:28:23.489 --> 00:28:28.011]  Oh, he met with the Russians and didn't say it.
[00:28:28.011 --> 00:28:29.812]  He put it on the forms.
[00:28:29.812 --> 00:28:32.993]  The FBI, the Justice Department told him, you don't do that.
[00:28:32.993 --> 00:28:33.713]  And he already knew that.
[00:28:33.713 --> 00:28:35.354]  He was being extra careful.
[00:28:35.354 --> 00:28:37.915]  But they play games at every level.
[00:28:37.915 --> 00:28:39.876]  Oh my gosh, Trump might meet with Putin.
[00:28:39.876 --> 00:28:42.917]  If he does that, we know he's a risky agent.
[00:28:44.926 --> 00:28:47.087]  Just like the fake FBI memo from Comey.
[00:28:47.087 --> 00:28:48.507]  Notice you don't hear about that anymore.
[00:28:48.507 --> 00:28:49.748]  Just put it out.
[00:28:49.748 --> 00:28:50.788]  Say it shows all this.
[00:28:50.788 --> 00:28:53.009]  When it turns out it's not real, just forget about it.
[00:28:53.009 --> 00:28:56.691]  Don't supply it to Congress.
[00:28:56.691 --> 00:29:03.553]  Because Comey testified two months after that meeting, when that memo supposedly was created, that Trump or no one else ever tried to influence him.
[00:29:03.553 --> 00:29:04.094]  But here it is.
[00:29:04.094 --> 00:29:08.676]  Did Trump, Kushner, Sessions, have an undisclosed meeting with a Russian?
[00:29:08.676 --> 00:29:10.596]  Dun dun dun!
[00:29:10.596 --> 00:29:12.577]  The Spanish Inquisition!
[00:29:12.577 --> 00:29:14.178]  More like the Russian Inquisition!
[00:29:14.918 --> 00:29:16.318]  Dun, dun, dun!
[00:29:16.318 --> 00:29:27.162]  The FBI and Congress are examining a campaign event last spring during which Donald Trump, Jeff Sessions, and Jared Kushner were in a small gathering with Russian Ambassador to the U.S.
[00:29:27.162 --> 00:29:29.243]  and other diplomats at Washington's Mayflower Hotel.
[00:29:29.243 --> 00:29:32.004]  Oh my gosh, they were once at a meeting with a bunch of diplomats.
[00:29:32.004 --> 00:29:32.944]  Oh my gosh, you can't do that!
[00:29:33.584 --> 00:29:34.564]  Five current former U.S.
[00:29:34.564 --> 00:29:44.348]  officials said they were aware of classified intelligence, suggesting, oh, suggesting, there was some sort of private encounter between Trump and his aides at the Russian envoy.
[00:29:44.348 --> 00:29:45.688]  Oh, see?
[00:29:45.688 --> 00:29:50.370]  Meanwhile, Hillary's meeting secretly with Putin, doing uranium deals, all that's okay.
[00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:51.770]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.291]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.291 --> 00:29:56.972]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.596 --> 00:30:06.338]  Bilderberg 2017 is kicking off in Chantilly, Virginia this year.
[00:30:06.338 --> 00:30:15.883]  This is the first Bilderberg meeting since the populist uprisings of Brexit and the Trump election have come to pass, and the elites now see their power base crumbling before their very eyes.
[00:30:15.883 --> 00:30:21.446]  Among some of the subjects of the secret confab will be the Trump administration, and can he be healed?
[00:30:21.446 --> 00:30:23.447]  Also the rise of populism.
[00:30:23.447 --> 00:30:25.448]  Elites are beginning to fear that their power base
[00:30:25.788 --> 00:30:26.709]  Maybe crumbling.
[00:30:26.709 --> 00:30:30.472]  Now three members of the current Trump administration are going to be attending.
[00:30:30.472 --> 00:30:33.595]  HR McMaster, Wilbur Ross, and Chris Liddell.
[00:30:33.595 --> 00:30:39.500]  Most Trump insiders believe that these three are there to help the elites derail the current administration.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.202]  There are two ways in which this can go.
[00:30:41.202 --> 00:30:43.204]  Either the globals will try to bring Trump to heel,
[00:30:43.404 --> 00:30:46.167]  Or they will try to impeach him after the 2018 election.
[00:30:46.167 --> 00:30:51.293]  You can read more about this and exclusive Bilderberg schemes to overthrow Trump on InfoWars.com.
[00:30:51.293 --> 00:30:54.517]  And ask yourself, what are you doing to wake up minds?
[00:30:54.517 --> 00:30:56.819]  Spread this link and help wake up some minds.
[00:30:56.819 --> 00:31:00.123]  Rob Due reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:31:01.224 --> 00:31:03.105]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:03.105 --> 00:31:05.126]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:05.126 --> 00:31:08.027]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:08.027 --> 00:31:14.110]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:21.473]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed
[00:31:21.593 --> 00:31:23.275]  Alex, a pure breeze.
[00:31:23.275 --> 00:31:30.821]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:31:30.821 --> 00:31:38.849]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:38.849 --> 00:31:39.830]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:41.019 --> 00:31:44.402]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:48.545]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:48.545 --> 00:31:55.250]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:59.353]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:15.730]  In America's 240-plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:22.534]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about, is those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[00:32:22.534 --> 00:32:23.475]  This group of specials
[00:32:23.755 --> 00:32:34.867]  For 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.
[00:32:34.867 --> 00:32:39.712]  We have over a thousand high-quality products available that are discounted at MFORESTORE.com.
[00:32:39.892 --> 00:32:42.814]  You add AutoShip, several of these are lost leaders.

[00:32:52.903 --> 00:33:00.529]  These are our Memorial Day specials as we remember the fallen in defense of this republic, the true trailblazers on which all of us stand.

[00:33:18.979 --> 00:33:35.829]  I'm willing to immediately work with democratic leaders to either negotiate our way back into Paris under the terms that are fair to the United States and its workers or to negotiate a new deal
[00:33:37.076 --> 00:33:39.523]  That protects our country and its taxpayers.
[00:33:46.562 --> 00:33:52.007]  So if the obstructionists want to get together with me, let's make them non-obstructionists.
[00:33:52.007 --> 00:34:10.846]  We will all sit down and we will get back into the deal and we'll make it good and we won't be closing up our factories and we won't be losing our jobs and we'll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord or something that we can do that's much better than the Paris Accord
[00:34:12.089 --> 00:34:17.172]  And I think the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of the world will be thrilled.
[00:34:17.172 --> 00:34:21.354]  But until we do that, we're out of the agreement.
[00:34:21.354 --> 00:34:41.163]  I will work to ensure that America remains the world's leader on environmental issues, but under a framework that is fair and where the burdens and responsibilities are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.
[00:34:43.126 --> 00:34:58.316]  No responsible leader can put the workers and the people of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.
[00:34:58.316 --> 00:35:03.199]  The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States while empowering
[00:35:04.542 --> 00:35:22.073]  Some of the world's top polluting countries should dispel any doubt as to the real reason why foreign lobbyists wish to keep our magnificent country tied up and bound down by this agreement.
[00:35:22.073 --> 00:35:22.774]  It's to give
[00:35:23.564 --> 00:35:27.766]  Their country, an economic edge over the United States.
[00:35:27.766 --> 00:35:29.567]  That's not going to happen while I'm president.
[00:35:29.567 --> 00:35:30.488]  I'm sorry.
[00:35:30.488 --> 00:35:47.517]  My job as president is to do everything within my power to give America a level playing field and to create the economic, regulatory, and tax structures that make America the most prosperous and productive
[00:35:48.459 --> 00:36:03.091]  Country on Earth, and with the highest standard of living, and the highest standard of environmental protection.
[00:36:03.091 --> 00:36:10.518]  Our tax bill is moving along in Congress, and I believe it's doing very well.
[00:36:10.518 --> 00:36:14.461]  I think a lot of people would be very pleasantly surprised.
[00:36:14.461 --> 00:36:16.523]  The Republicans are working very, very hard.
[00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:22.332]  We'd love to have support from the Democrats, but we may have to go it alone.
[00:36:22.332 --> 00:36:25.293]  But it's going very well.
[00:36:25.293 --> 00:36:43.319]  The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States economy in order to win praise from the very foreign capitals and global activists that have long sought to gain wealth at our country's expense.
[00:36:43.319 --> 00:36:46.540]  They don't put America first.
[00:36:47.646 --> 00:36:55.989]  I do, and I always will.
[00:36:55.989 --> 00:37:16.595]  The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices, and in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.
[00:37:17.571 --> 00:37:19.071]  You see what's happening?
[00:37:19.071 --> 00:37:23.372]  It's pretty obvious to those that want to keep an open mind.
[00:37:23.372 --> 00:37:27.934]  At what point does America get demeaned?
[00:37:27.934 --> 00:37:32.935]  At what point do they start laughing at us as a country?
[00:37:32.935 --> 00:37:39.597]  We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.
[00:37:39.597 --> 00:37:39.897]  That's right.
[00:37:42.478 --> 00:37:48.119]  Other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won't be.
[00:37:48.119 --> 00:37:49.920]  They won't be.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:38:00.342]  I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
[00:38:00.342 --> 00:38:01.662]  That's why they hate him so much.
[00:38:01.662 --> 00:38:03.563]  He literally represents America.
[00:38:04.522 --> 00:38:06.943]  He literally is trying to bring us prosperity.
[00:38:06.943 --> 00:38:14.106]  He literally is open and free and got a rainbow flag at the convention saying, I don't hate anybody.
[00:38:14.106 --> 00:38:17.227]  You ever seen a Republican do that?
[00:38:17.227 --> 00:38:24.390]  And so the liberal gay groups hate him more than ever because they're bought and paid for by Soros.
[00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:25.751]  I don't dislike gay people at all.
[00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.591]  Neither does Trump.
[00:38:27.591 --> 00:38:33.938]  It's that I dislike the ones that say, you don't like me if you don't turn in your guns and have high taxes.
[00:38:33.938 --> 00:38:36.802]  And I'm like, no!
[00:38:36.802 --> 00:38:42.008]  The left is a consortium of people that want to conquer everybody else, that want to run our lives.
[00:38:42.008 --> 00:38:43.309]  Finally, the left even gets it.
[00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:45.152]  This thing that happened last week is finally in the New York Times.
[00:38:46.377 --> 00:38:55.101]  When the left turns on its own, Brent Weinstein, the biology professor, is a big social justice warrior, big liberal, uses all the weird binary terms and all of it.
[00:38:55.101 --> 00:38:58.163]  But he said you shouldn't have a weekend where no whites are allowed on campus.
[00:38:58.163 --> 00:39:01.064]  That's discriminatory.
[00:39:01.064 --> 00:39:02.605]  They said, oh, you need to be fired.
[00:39:02.605 --> 00:39:05.547]  He's got death threats, you name it.
[00:39:05.547 --> 00:39:11.850]  And now all the crazy KKK-style minorities, which is just the same as the KKK, whacked out.
[00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:12.970]  They believe they're in the right.
[00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:14.531]  They believe they've been wronged.
[00:39:14.531 --> 00:39:15.672]  They're flipping out on him.
[00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:20.857]  And some mainstream media is going, well, is it really a big deal?
[00:39:20.857 --> 00:39:28.441]  Even the New York Post yesterday was like, they're making a big deal out of this, but you know.
[00:39:28.441 --> 00:39:29.081]  Is it a big deal?
[00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:29.542]  So what?
[00:39:29.542 --> 00:39:32.964]  We have some days where whites can't come on campus.
[00:39:32.964 --> 00:39:35.085]  That's literally going back to pre-Martin Luther King.
[00:39:35.085 --> 00:39:36.486]  But this is what they're doing.
[00:39:36.486 --> 00:39:38.847]  They want cults of controllable people.
[00:39:41.084 --> 00:39:54.112]  Because if we have a culture based on free market and upward mobility and the renaissance and choices and free society, the tyrants can't have their world technocracy.
[00:39:54.112 --> 00:39:56.854]  Like Obama said, you can't have a car, you can't have air conditioning.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.761]  If you do, the earth will boil over.
[00:40:02.761 --> 00:40:06.383]  I'm gonna fly and land on a jumbo jet because I'm the elite, but you can't have anything.
[00:40:06.383 --> 00:40:07.984]  Not, we're gonna have cleaner technology.
[00:40:07.984 --> 00:40:08.844]  Not, no, no.
[00:40:08.844 --> 00:40:10.966]  They're saying, you need to be poor to save the earth.
[00:40:10.966 --> 00:40:11.786]  Okay?
[00:40:11.786 --> 00:40:12.927]  You just stay right there and die.
[00:40:12.927 --> 00:40:19.370]  We're gonna go to Owen Schroer, who's in Chantilly, Virginia in a moment, at Bilderberg 2017.
[00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:24.893]  But before I go any further, we are Lister-supported.
[00:40:24.893 --> 00:40:26.054]  And now, more than ever.
[00:40:27.824 --> 00:40:29.005]  We're trying to build our own economy.
[00:40:29.005 --> 00:40:34.689]  We're trying to launch a TV, you know, basically network.
[00:40:34.689 --> 00:40:37.351]  I have live transmissions, 18 hours a day or so.
[00:40:37.351 --> 00:40:40.553]  We're going to start launching shows the next month and a half, the next six months.
[00:40:40.553 --> 00:40:42.495]  Go live about 18 hours a day.
[00:40:42.495 --> 00:40:45.978]  But that takes your support and we make it easy.
[00:40:45.978 --> 00:40:53.363]  We have Memorial Day special that I'm now calling the beginning of summer special that we're extending through the weekend, but then we got to stop with some stuff's about to sell out.
[00:40:53.363 --> 00:40:54.384]  30% off Supermetal Vitality.
[00:40:56.218 --> 00:40:57.685]  Sixty-five percent off.
[00:40:57.685 --> 00:40:58.951]  Coil silver, silver bullet.
[00:41:00.751 --> 00:41:03.492]  Rainforest, 47% off retail.
[00:41:03.492 --> 00:41:05.652]  Secret 12, 43% off retail.
[00:41:05.652 --> 00:41:07.413]  Knock out the Amazing Sleep Aid, normally $19.95.
[00:41:07.413 --> 00:41:09.634]  It's $9.95, folks.
[00:41:09.634 --> 00:41:11.074]  That is such an insane deal.
[00:41:11.074 --> 00:41:12.815]  That is almost a loss of a liter.
[00:41:12.815 --> 00:41:16.796]  And it's just got the L-tryptophan, it's got the valerian root, it's got the melatonin.
[00:41:16.796 --> 00:41:25.498]  All the regular dosages you'd buy, you know, at the drugstore or at the vitamin store, nine different bottles for like $15, $20, $30 a piece.
[00:41:25.498 --> 00:41:27.219]  You get them all at the same dose, organic.
[00:41:27.799 --> 00:41:29.219]  For $9.95.
[00:41:29.219 --> 00:41:32.440]  No one can top this.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:43.102]  I've talked about my great lawyer whose name's on the family code here in Texas, Randy Wilhite, who's been on four different drugs, sleep studies, very private guy, but he said I could tell you this story.
[00:41:43.102 --> 00:41:46.042]  Was ruining his life, because for years he made himself stay up all night.
[00:41:46.042 --> 00:41:47.602]  He used to be Ray Swartz Haines' main lawyer.
[00:41:47.602 --> 00:41:50.543]  He's been a very famous criminal lawyer as well.
[00:41:50.543 --> 00:41:55.064]  He trained himself to stay up all night, sometimes for days, just on coffee.
[00:41:55.064 --> 00:41:56.224]  And his brain kind of got
[00:41:57.389 --> 00:42:00.271]  Kiltered to that.
[00:42:00.271 --> 00:42:03.253]  He's a handsome guy, big guy.
[00:42:03.253 --> 00:42:06.335]  He doesn't look bad, but he looks ten years younger on Knockout.
[00:42:06.335 --> 00:42:07.837]  Sort of taken it six months ago.
[00:42:07.837 --> 00:42:10.699]  He takes one and now sleeps like a baby.
[00:42:10.699 --> 00:42:14.181]  It's changed his whole life.
[00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:15.662]  His whole life.
[00:42:15.662 --> 00:42:19.045]  He's had to learn to cut back clients so he's not up overnight.
[00:42:19.045 --> 00:42:21.026]  He's a UT professor as well.
[00:42:21.026 --> 00:42:23.468]  But I'm going to get him to come in sometime and just do a testimonial because
[00:42:24.974 --> 00:42:27.055]  This is one of the products I'm proud of, because I had the idea.
[00:42:27.055 --> 00:42:31.037]  $19.95 for a bottle of melatonin, sometimes I have trouble sleeping.
[00:42:31.037 --> 00:42:36.599]  And I was looking at the dosage, and then I looked into private labeling, and I found out we could do it for like $2 a bottle.
[00:42:36.599 --> 00:42:43.002]  Now, everybody's selling it for $19, and it's like $2 for the product, the bottle, and then the bottle's like 30 cents.
[00:42:43.002 --> 00:42:45.784]  So I said for like, you know, two and a half dollars or less, this is what it is.
[00:42:45.784 --> 00:42:47.424]  I said, well, how much is L-tryptophan?
[00:42:47.424 --> 00:42:48.405]  How much is valerian root?
[00:42:48.405 --> 00:42:48.705]  How much?
[00:42:48.705 --> 00:42:50.786]  And they were all so inexpensive compounds.
[00:42:51.937 --> 00:43:02.327]  That I could bottle it for like, you know, eight bucks a bottle, sell it for $9.95 and dominate everyone else.
[00:43:02.327 --> 00:43:06.511]  Now something like DNA Force, we're talking $40,000 or more a kilo.
[00:43:09.403 --> 00:43:12.965]  Just for the BioPQQ, we have the very best from the Japanese, made in America.
[00:43:12.965 --> 00:43:16.588]  Just look at the BioPQQ or CoQ10, this is not the synthetic crap.
[00:43:16.588 --> 00:43:19.389]  DNA Force, you know, costs $130 when we've got it.
[00:43:19.389 --> 00:43:24.112]  It's usually sold out because I can't ever get all the super high quality nutraceutical compounds.
[00:43:24.112 --> 00:43:30.977]  So something like that where a bottle is costing us $60, you know, we're going to have 100% markup.
[00:43:30.977 --> 00:43:34.939]  But these are all the very best products out there.
[00:43:34.939 --> 00:43:36.540]  All Trump shirts are at cost, 75% off.
[00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:37.041]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:43:39.795 --> 00:43:49.340]  Or 888-253-3139, and it is your purchases of the products, buying the videos, the books, the t-shirts, all of it that funds this operation.
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.962]  And in closing, we're going to run this special through next Monday.
[00:43:52.962 --> 00:43:53.903]  Please take advantage of it.
[00:43:53.903 --> 00:43:55.504]  Please support the broadcast.
[00:43:55.504 --> 00:43:58.485]  We also are so excited about Emerix Essentials.
[00:43:58.485 --> 00:44:03.408]  That's six personal care products, body wash, shampoo, all organic, sunscreen.
[00:44:06.434 --> 00:44:07.934]  Bug repellent.
[00:44:07.934 --> 00:44:09.135]  All of it.
[00:44:09.135 --> 00:44:09.815]  Deodorant.
[00:44:09.815 --> 00:44:11.996]  It's all 20% off what it would be in stores.
[00:44:11.996 --> 00:44:12.816]  It's a big national brand.
[00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:13.756]  We private label.
[00:44:13.756 --> 00:44:15.097]  Even the label's the same except the name.
[00:44:15.097 --> 00:44:17.958]  Everybody probably recognizes this as one of the top sellers of Whole Foods.
[00:44:17.958 --> 00:44:19.318]  It's one of the top three brands in the country.
[00:44:19.318 --> 00:44:20.318]  Organic.
[00:44:20.318 --> 00:44:22.239]  We have the mouthwash 10 to 1 concentrate.
[00:44:22.239 --> 00:44:22.579]  All of it.
[00:44:22.579 --> 00:44:24.119]  The deodorant is amazing.
[00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:24.860]  All of it's organic.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.660]  Doesn't have the metals in it.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.661]  The sunscreen is the non-nano zinc.
[00:44:29.764 --> 00:44:31.825]  Non-nano zinc, so it's healthy.
[00:44:31.825 --> 00:44:34.167]  This is the very best product.
[00:44:34.167 --> 00:44:36.689]  20% off retail and limited time.
[00:44:36.689 --> 00:44:39.871]  It's going to stop soon.
[00:44:39.871 --> 00:44:40.871]  25% off.
[00:44:40.871 --> 00:44:42.552]  25% off auto ship.
[00:44:42.552 --> 00:44:44.334]  Everything else is 10% off auto ship.
[00:44:44.334 --> 00:44:50.157]  This is 25% introductory because I want you to try these products.
[00:44:50.157 --> 00:44:55.621]  I mean, folks, you're talking like $8 or $7 or $6 for some of these products that are like $20 in stores.
[00:44:57.728 --> 00:45:02.890]  Because I just want you to get so hammered with quality, you decide to be a repeat customer.
[00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:03.751]  Because soon it's going to go to 10%.
[00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:06.172]  Because we need to make some profit to fund this operation.
[00:45:06.172 --> 00:45:09.333]  Infowarslife.com, Emirates Essentials, check them out today.
[00:45:09.333 --> 00:45:10.594]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:45:10.594 --> 00:45:13.315]  Support our local affiliates as well, their local sponsors.
[00:45:13.315 --> 00:45:15.896]  Okay.
[00:45:15.896 --> 00:45:20.118]  Joining us from Chantilly, Virginia, we'll talk to David Knight later in the broadcast.
[00:45:20.118 --> 00:45:25.180]  Owen Schroyer and the team are there for the Bilderberg meeting, which they didn't admit existed just 10 years ago.
[00:45:26.236 --> 00:45:27.036]  They're there meeting.
[00:45:27.036 --> 00:45:28.937]  World leaders are meeting in secret.
[00:45:28.937 --> 00:45:32.798]  And admittedly, because some of the people that are there are in public saying they want to overthrow Trump.
[00:45:32.798 --> 00:45:34.519]  The German papers are saying F you to Trump.
[00:45:34.519 --> 00:45:37.320]  Juncker's promising a trade war to overthrow Trump.
[00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.001]  So, Owen Schroyer, you're there.
[00:45:39.001 --> 00:45:45.763]  They've been denying globalism exists, private world government, their carbon tax, but now it's all being annihilated right in front of us.
[00:45:45.763 --> 00:45:48.744]  What a time to be there while world government's in crisis.
[00:45:49.858 --> 00:45:52.641]  Yeah, it's a pretty just incredible time to be alive, period.
[00:45:52.641 --> 00:45:55.603]  We're undergoing so many changes right now for humanity.
[00:45:55.603 --> 00:46:04.431]  We decide whether we have a corporate world government that will determine our future, or if sovereign nations and sovereign citizens will be able to determine our future.
[00:46:04.431 --> 00:46:06.173]  And the people who are meeting right behind us
[00:46:06.713 --> 00:46:08.074]  Well, Alex, you know what they want.
[00:46:08.074 --> 00:46:09.394]  They want corporate control.
[00:46:09.394 --> 00:46:20.419]  They want to get out ahead of the human advancement so that they can implement their control grid before humanity actually catches up to the technology that they have already.
[00:46:20.419 --> 00:46:31.583]  But, you know, you said something earlier, Alex, that's really key here, and I try to instill this in people's minds about what's happening at Bilderberg and about President Trump.
[00:46:31.583 --> 00:46:35.545]  Whether you like President Donald Trump or not is irrelevant.
[00:46:36.129 --> 00:46:39.354]  President Donald Trump is an American president.
[00:46:39.354 --> 00:46:42.099]  He represents the American people.
[00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:47.307]  Whatever agendas, whatever goals he has, he's acting as an American.
[00:46:47.307 --> 00:46:49.570]  He's not being, you know,
[00:46:50.569 --> 00:47:10.619]  Diluted or he's not being controlled by foreign operatives by you know banks or any of this he's acting for a sovereign nation of America and Whether you like President Trump or not you should at least be willing to get behind That for the first time we're having a president who actually cares about America and not as willing to sell out to the globalists
[00:47:11.374 --> 00:47:13.075]  Why can't Americans at least get behind that?
[00:47:13.075 --> 00:47:15.197]  Well, they don't even know that globalism exists.
[00:47:15.197 --> 00:47:25.645]  And Alex, we went out on the streets in Herndon yesterday, and I talked to about 20 individuals, I think about 16 or 17 of them, never even heard of Bilderberg.
[00:47:25.645 --> 00:47:29.448]  You can see in the videos, when I'm talking to them, they think I'm crazy.
[00:47:29.448 --> 00:47:33.131]  They're like, oh yeah, if that actually exists, you're probably just making that up.
[00:47:33.131 --> 00:47:36.754]  But if that exists, and I'm like, hey bro, I literally just left.
[00:47:36.754 --> 00:47:37.955]  I was just there.
[00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:38.696]  It definitely
[00:47:38.916 --> 00:47:40.136]  You know why they do that, Owen?
[00:47:40.136 --> 00:47:44.577]  Because on the Simpsons and countless other shows, for like 20 years, they go, Bilderberg?
[00:47:44.577 --> 00:47:45.877]  You mean Build-a-burger?
[00:47:45.877 --> 00:47:50.358]  That's like the weird counter to royalty, world leaders, meeting in secret.
[00:47:50.358 --> 00:48:05.081]  Admittedly, congressional documents have been leaked to us, where it shows it's all secret, a plan for a world government, they created the EU, this is the major power brokers, this is where Hillary and Obama met in 2008, she decided to step down, that's now been admitted.
[00:48:05.081 --> 00:48:07.462]  I was there, calling national media saying,
[00:48:07.642 --> 00:48:08.542]  You're looking for Hillary.
[00:48:08.542 --> 00:48:10.303]  She's been missing for a day with Obama.
[00:48:10.303 --> 00:48:11.423]  Here she is!
[00:48:11.423 --> 00:48:14.105]  They didn't want to hear it because they were so controlled.
[00:48:14.105 --> 00:48:19.527]  You know, speaking of national media, Alex, I haven't seen any national media out here.
[00:48:19.527 --> 00:48:25.729]  I've been tuning in intermittently to mainstream news just to see if they're covering this.
[00:48:25.729 --> 00:48:26.309]  No.
[00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:27.830]  Complete radio silence.
[00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:33.992]  Even Lindsey Graham goes on Fox News this morning, does an interview for a whole segment, at least 10 minutes.
[00:48:33.992 --> 00:48:35.693]  You know how many times Bilderberg got brought up?
[00:48:36.253 --> 00:48:37.473]  Zero times.
[00:48:37.473 --> 00:48:39.774]  Lindsey Graham is a regular Bilderberger attendee.
[00:48:39.774 --> 00:48:42.315]  You're not even going to ask him about Bilderberg?
[00:48:42.315 --> 00:48:52.317]  You're not even going to ask him about what they're talking about as far as their number one agenda this year, which is addressing the President of the United States' plan to make America great again, Donald Trump?
[00:48:52.317 --> 00:48:54.178]  Nothing from Fox News on that.
[00:48:54.178 --> 00:48:56.418]  So, I don't even know if they know what's going on.
[00:48:56.418 --> 00:48:58.139]  Maybe they don't even know what's going on, Alex.
[00:48:58.139 --> 00:49:01.980]  Maybe their head is still in the clouds, and they don't even know that Bilderberg is going on.
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.480]  But it's amazing to think
[00:49:04.201 --> 00:49:09.030]  That just like you said, 10 years ago they said this event doesn't happen.
[00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:10.933]  This conference doesn't exist.
[00:49:10.933 --> 00:49:14.820]  Now they just put it out in the public and it's almost like because they're public now...
[00:49:15.817 --> 00:49:16.857]  Nobody wants to talk about it.
[00:49:16.857 --> 00:49:18.098]  Oh, because it's just a public meeting.
[00:49:18.098 --> 00:49:18.958]  There's nothing to see here.
[00:49:18.958 --> 00:49:19.839]  It's just a public meeting.
[00:49:19.839 --> 00:49:21.099]  There's no reason to cover this.
[00:49:21.099 --> 00:49:21.779]  Oh, really?
[00:49:21.779 --> 00:49:22.119]  Let's see.
[00:49:22.119 --> 00:49:25.501]  There's about 20 security guards sitting behind me.
[00:49:25.501 --> 00:49:28.582]  I had four paddy wagons come in in the last 20 minutes.
[00:49:28.582 --> 00:49:29.522]  Well, let's be clear.
[00:49:29.522 --> 00:49:30.643]  Those are local security guards.
[00:49:30.643 --> 00:49:31.303]  Those are police.
[00:49:31.303 --> 00:49:32.183]  They've got SWAT teams.
[00:49:32.183 --> 00:49:34.144]  They've got Marines in plain clothes.
[00:49:34.144 --> 00:49:34.424]  Go ahead.
[00:49:35.325 --> 00:49:41.208]  Well, and I just want to say, the confrontations that I've had with the security officers here, they're very nice people.
[00:49:41.208 --> 00:49:45.151]  They seem like they're just American citizens, just like you or I, and they're just out here doing their job.
[00:49:45.151 --> 00:49:46.571]  Well, most of them are listeners.
[00:49:46.571 --> 00:49:47.652]  I've talked to them on the phone.
[00:49:47.652 --> 00:49:56.577]  Yeah, but you can tell that, again, you just have to ask yourself, if there is this group of elites having this meeting,
[00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:02.451]  And their elite, their experience, they have all these successes and accomplishments, right?
[00:50:02.451 --> 00:50:03.572]  They're trying to help humanity.
[00:50:03.572 --> 00:50:04.952]  That's why they're having this meeting.
[00:50:04.952 --> 00:50:06.613]  Well, why do it behind closed doors?
[00:50:06.613 --> 00:50:08.353]  Why not do it live on Facebook?
[00:50:08.353 --> 00:50:09.694]  Why not do it live on YouTube?
[00:50:09.694 --> 00:50:11.414]  Why not do it live on Periscope?
[00:50:11.414 --> 00:50:12.995]  Why not put out videos?
[00:50:12.995 --> 00:50:19.957]  And again, they denied back when Phyllis Schlafly didn't even know the name and was exposing it from her Washington contacts.
[00:50:19.957 --> 00:50:21.697]  In the 50s, they said she was crazy.
[00:50:21.697 --> 00:50:24.858]  And then they had another reporter, Pegler, Westbrook Pegler.
[00:50:24.858 --> 00:50:26.859]  And then, of course, there was the great
[00:50:27.953 --> 00:50:31.756]  A writer for so many years who just died a few years ago.
[00:50:31.756 --> 00:50:37.061]  You know, God bless his soul, from the American Free Press.
[00:50:37.061 --> 00:50:52.934]  Tucker, you've got all this happening, and they're just denying it exists, and then now it is out in the open, and world government's out in the open, and George Soros is out in the open, that they're unelected, it's unaccountable, that the carbon tax is unelected, unaccountable, that the EU's unelected, unaccountable.
[00:50:52.934 --> 00:50:54.856]  I mean, who made Jean-Claude Juncker's?
[00:50:55.396 --> 00:50:57.659]  You know, ruler of the world of the unelected EU.
[00:50:57.659 --> 00:50:58.480]  It's a big day.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.262]  We'll come back to Owen.
[00:51:01.075 --> 00:51:01.955]  It's a no-brainer.
[00:51:01.955 --> 00:51:04.336]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[00:51:04.336 --> 00:51:12.380]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.301]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[00:51:14.301 --> 00:51:17.962]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[00:51:17.962 --> 00:51:22.624]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[00:51:22.624 --> 00:51:27.026]  Call or click 1-877-99BERKEY or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[00:51:27.026 --> 00:51:27.667]  That's 1-877-99BERKEY.
[00:51:31.108 --> 00:51:35.311]  Nearly one third of FBI domestic terrorism cases involve refugees.
[00:51:35.311 --> 00:51:36.211]  One third.
[00:51:36.211 --> 00:51:38.233]  There's already been riots across Europe.
[00:51:38.233 --> 00:51:39.434]  Is America next?
[00:51:39.434 --> 00:51:41.715]  Hi, I'm the owner of Infidel Body Armor.
[00:51:41.715 --> 00:51:46.918]  Over the past four years, I've sold thousands of body armor kits and trained hundreds of sheepdogs.
[00:51:46.918 --> 00:51:48.259]  They have prepared.
[00:51:48.259 --> 00:51:49.260]  Have you?
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:53.923]  I invite you to go to my website at infidelbodyarmor.com and click on specials.
[00:51:53.923 --> 00:51:55.084]  Trouble is coming.
[00:51:55.084 --> 00:51:56.605]  Now do something about it.
[00:51:56.605 --> 00:51:59.647]  Infidelbodyarmor.com just won't quit.
[00:52:00.467 --> 00:52:14.759]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:52:14.759 --> 00:52:17.061]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[00:52:17.061 --> 00:52:21.505]  It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:27.650]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because
[00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:33.774]  We want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk, but took action.
[00:52:33.774 --> 00:52:38.777]  We have over a thousand high-quality products available that are discounted at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:52:38.777 --> 00:52:41.678]  You add AutoShip, several of these are lost leaders.

[00:52:51.704 --> 00:52:59.389]  These are our Memorial Day specials as we remember the fallen in defense of this Republic, the true trailblazers on which all of us stand.
[00:53:08.615 --> 00:53:11.836]  Do you know that some Americans have more credit card debt than savings?
[00:53:11.836 --> 00:53:15.036]  Don't you wish that there was an easy way to consolidate debt and save?
[00:53:15.036 --> 00:53:18.217]  With a fixed interest rate loan through Avant, that wish can come true.

[00:54:17.438 --> 00:54:24.961]  We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.
[00:54:24.961 --> 00:54:32.624]  We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won't be.
[00:54:32.624 --> 00:54:33.084]  They won't be.
[00:54:34.409 --> 00:54:44.314]  I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
[00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:45.755]  Incredible.
[00:54:45.755 --> 00:54:55.260]  I want listeners to sit back and savor this and also thank God because you've been praying, I've been praying, we've been educating, you've been getting laughed at by your friends and family for decades.
[00:54:55.260 --> 00:55:03.325]  There were patriots going back to the time of Barry Goldwater and Phyllis Schlafly who were covering all this and talking about this before they even knew the name.
[00:55:04.127 --> 00:55:06.668]  That, hey, Washington elite are meeting outside D.C.
[00:55:06.668 --> 00:55:11.291]  and New York and in other cities every year plotting a takeover and they were getting attacked.
[00:55:11.291 --> 00:55:13.452]  It's all been proven.
[00:55:13.452 --> 00:55:15.674]  So I can't sit here and even take credit for this.
[00:55:15.674 --> 00:55:22.217]  Our ancestors did this and the patriots, the shoulders we stand on, people like Dr. Ron Paul.
[00:55:22.217 --> 00:55:24.959]  I want to salute everybody and Jim Tucker who died a few years ago.
[00:55:24.959 --> 00:55:27.180]  A lot of people say, well, why are you still covering it?
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:27.761]  It's passe.
[00:55:27.761 --> 00:55:28.841]  You've proven it exists.
[00:55:28.841 --> 00:55:29.342]  No.
[00:55:29.342 --> 00:55:31.143]  Now they just want to ignore that it exists.
[00:55:32.236 --> 00:55:37.858]  Owen Schroyer just said, Owen, you're reporting from Bilderberg and the rest of this segment and the next, take over and tell us your observations there.
[00:55:37.858 --> 00:55:39.258]  I mean, this is such a big deal.
[00:55:39.258 --> 00:55:43.079]  Here's global government camped outside D.C.
[00:55:43.079 --> 00:55:45.100]  This is an epic moment.
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.740]  Think about this, Alex.
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:54.703]  Not only is this a meeting of global elites here trying to form a secret shadow of global government, it's also very fascistic, right?
[00:55:54.703 --> 00:55:56.623]  I mean, it's the definition of fascism.
[00:55:56.623 --> 00:55:58.184]  So, where's Antifa?
[00:55:59.088 --> 00:56:09.012]  I'm sorry, Antifa shows up anytime there's a Trump hat or a Trump shirt, but where's Antifa out here when there's an actual fascist meeting happening behind us of a secret world government?
[00:56:09.012 --> 00:56:10.032]  No Antifa!
[00:56:10.032 --> 00:56:14.554]  I guess George Soros didn't want to pay his little protesters to come out here and protest today, huh?
[00:56:14.554 --> 00:56:16.715]  How convenient is that, Alex?
[00:56:16.715 --> 00:56:23.338]  And again, it's just worth mentioning, there's probably more security guards here than there are protesters or media.
[00:56:23.738 --> 00:56:27.642]  They got more security detail out here than actual people and nobody's really trying to penetrate.
[00:56:27.642 --> 00:56:28.742]  They're kind of just hanging out.
[00:56:28.742 --> 00:56:30.924]  I think that they know that they're not going to get let in.
[00:56:30.924 --> 00:56:34.828]  They had to put up, they literally planted new trees, Alex.
[00:56:35.467 --> 00:56:39.570]  Down this road right here, you used to be able to see the hotel if you were on the road.
[00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:45.535]  Well, they didn't like that, so they went ahead and planted a new row of trees so that you can't see in there.
[00:56:45.535 --> 00:56:54.121]  Also, Harrison, if you'll show this camera right here, they've got a stand-up portable security camera that they just have posted up across the street, too.
[00:56:54.121 --> 00:56:59.545]  So, just extra measures that they're taking to maintain their secrecy.
[00:56:59.545 --> 00:57:00.346]  And it's funny, too.
[00:57:01.198 --> 00:57:09.724]  Because you had Democrats who wanted to try to play the Logan Act against people in the Trump administration for having meetings or meeting with Russia or this or that and the other thing.
[00:57:09.724 --> 00:57:13.307]  Meanwhile, you've got multiple members of the Trump administration inside.
[00:57:13.307 --> 00:57:18.131]  You've got Tom Cotton, Lindsey Graham, other people that were invited to Bilderberg this year.
[00:57:18.131 --> 00:57:22.854]  I have heard radio silence on complaining about the Logan Act there as well.
[00:57:22.854 --> 00:57:25.116]  So it's amazing how Bilderberg just has this
[00:57:25.788 --> 00:57:28.470]  They get to just operate differently, you know.
[00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:31.272]  Oh, we'll ignore the Logan Act when it comes to Bilderberg.
[00:57:31.272 --> 00:57:35.194]  Oh, we're Antifa, we're anti-fascist, but we'll ignore the Bilderberg group.
[00:57:35.194 --> 00:57:36.555]  Nothing to see there.
[00:57:36.555 --> 00:57:37.756]  No big deal.
[00:57:37.756 --> 00:57:40.337]  And I want to say this, Alex, and I don't know if this is possible.
[00:57:40.337 --> 00:57:47.482]  Maybe it's too late, and perhaps even this is something that we should have thought of before, but you know how the news cycle is these days.
[00:57:47.482 --> 00:57:48.303]  It's absolutely crazy.
[00:57:48.303 --> 00:57:50.544]  It's impossible to have so much forethought.
[00:57:50.544 --> 00:57:51.905]  But you know what I think needs to happen?
[00:57:52.759 --> 00:57:56.605]  I think there needs to be a pro-Trump rally right here tomorrow.
[00:57:56.605 --> 00:57:57.186]  That's pure genius.
[00:57:57.186 --> 00:57:58.868]  Right in front of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:57:58.868 --> 00:58:00.050]  Because think about it.
[00:58:00.050 --> 00:58:01.432]  Alright, we already got them.
[00:58:01.432 --> 00:58:01.873]  We got them.
[00:58:01.873 --> 00:58:02.494]  They're open.
[00:58:02.494 --> 00:58:03.135]  They're open to the public.
[00:58:03.135 --> 00:58:03.435]  You know what?
[00:58:03.435 --> 00:58:04.937]  Two weeks ago, I was literally
[00:58:06.167 --> 00:58:07.208]  So they're brushing my teeth.
[00:58:07.208 --> 00:58:10.591]  I don't know why you have those thoughts in the shower, brushing your teeth or whatever, kind of in the morning.
[00:58:10.591 --> 00:58:19.219]  But I was thinking, I was thinking, we need to go have a anti-globalist protest this year, a big one in front of the enemies of Trump.
[00:58:19.219 --> 00:58:20.119]  Think about it, Alex.
[00:58:20.119 --> 00:58:23.883]  If we're out here saying, Trump, Trump, Trump, that's what they hate!
[00:58:24.503 --> 00:58:25.945]  That's what the Build America Today is saying, what's wrong?
[00:58:51.724 --> 00:58:58.950]  In America, more than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:11.760]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, a bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:15.601]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:59:15.601 --> 00:59:22.583]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[00:59:22.583 --> 00:59:35.447]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:59:35.447 --> 00:59:37.007]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:59:37.287 --> 00:59:43.688]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that Iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[00:59:43.688 --> 00:59:49.430]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-31... You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:12.412 --> 01:00:14.614]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:14.614 --> 01:00:21.720]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:25.122]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have got big breaking news.
[01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:26.864]  Bilderberg's agenda came out a few days ago.
[01:00:26.864 --> 01:00:27.864]  They used to keep it secret.
[01:00:27.864 --> 01:00:29.946]  They say dealing with Trump is number one.
[01:00:29.946 --> 01:00:35.130]  And members of Bilderberg Group, that are enlisted attendees, are saying they want to bring down Trump.
[01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:37.012]  So they're encamped outside D.C.
[01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:38.293]  Global government's out in the open.
[01:00:38.533 --> 01:00:44.218]  But our corporate media is still so controlled, zero US mainstream coverage, except for drugs.
[01:00:44.218 --> 01:00:45.199]  He's not mainstream.
[01:00:45.199 --> 01:00:49.343]  He's leaked some of the European news articles and some of Paul Watson's articles about this.
[01:00:49.343 --> 01:00:52.486]  So, Owen, continuing, and I want to get David Knight to pop in later, too, as well.
[01:00:52.486 --> 01:00:55.149]  He's been filing some powerful reports on your observations.
[01:00:56.587 --> 01:01:04.253]  Well, I would say that just from covering it my first time, obviously it's a lot different now because it's out in public.
[01:01:04.253 --> 01:01:08.276]  I don't know if there's more media or less media here than there typically is.
[01:01:08.276 --> 01:01:11.518]  It seems like, you know, right now there's probably about 30 people out here.
[01:01:11.518 --> 01:01:13.660]  Most of them are, you know, anti-Bilderbergers.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.302]  They're out here doing their own independent journalist broadcast.
[01:01:16.302 --> 01:01:20.585]  They're handing out newsletters, handing out flyers, talking to one another, like-minded people.
[01:01:21.425 --> 01:01:28.728]  And these are the type of people I think would be willing to come out here in a Trump shirt, in a Trump hat, just to create the optics that, you know what?
[01:01:28.728 --> 01:01:29.889]  We won.
[01:01:29.889 --> 01:01:35.471]  So you might still be having your secret meeting in there and your number one agenda might be how to stop Donald Trump.
[01:01:35.471 --> 01:01:36.152]  But guess what?
[01:01:36.152 --> 01:01:36.992]  We won.
[01:01:36.992 --> 01:01:38.633]  We beat your rigged election.
[01:01:38.633 --> 01:01:42.575]  You're trying to hide the rigged election right now with certain things that you're doing in D.C.
[01:01:42.575 --> 01:01:46.316]  We won't get into that at this time and certain prosecutors that wind up dead on a beach.
[01:01:46.316 --> 01:01:47.557]  But we won't get into that at this time.
[01:01:48.497 --> 01:01:52.960]  I think that it would be such a win for us in the optics of this.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.241]  And you know what, Alex?
[01:01:54.241 --> 01:01:56.582]  That might force the mainstream media to come out here.
[01:01:56.582 --> 01:01:57.643]  And how about this?
[01:01:57.643 --> 01:02:02.766]  What if we have a Trump rally out here in front of Bilderberg, and then Antifa shows up?
[01:02:02.766 --> 01:02:09.290]  We're out here supporting President Trump, who is literally like a capitalist, like the example of a capitalist.
[01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:14.273]  Somebody who goes out and builds, you know, real estate, golf courses, a capitalist, and
[01:02:15.033 --> 01:02:21.855]  Antifa comes out to protest a capitalist when they're anti-fascist, and the fascists are actually meeting right now!
[01:02:21.855 --> 01:02:22.875]  It's just ridiculous!
[01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:35.959]  And Alex, there was a report that David and I were going to file, and maybe we'll end up filing this later, and it really just is an example of the type of world that you will live in if these people get their way.
[01:02:35.959 --> 01:02:36.579]  Here in DC,
[01:02:37.668 --> 01:02:41.269]  We couldn't even park without using some ridiculous technology.
[01:02:41.269 --> 01:02:46.110]  You had to call a number, download an app, get your iris scanned, some craziness.
[01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:48.050]  We don't even know if we ever paid for the spot.
[01:02:48.050 --> 01:02:49.471]  And then we go to a restaurant.
[01:02:49.471 --> 01:02:51.331]  They hand you a card.
[01:02:51.331 --> 01:02:52.792]  Your waitress doesn't take your order.
[01:02:52.792 --> 01:02:54.932]  You like walk around and scan your card.
[01:02:54.932 --> 01:02:58.713]  And then when you're finished, they take your card and then they rally up your charges.
[01:02:59.173 --> 01:03:01.254]  It's the most inconvenient thing in the world.
[01:03:01.254 --> 01:03:02.655]  That's the technocracy.
[01:03:02.655 --> 01:03:03.855]  That's what these people want.
[01:03:03.855 --> 01:03:05.516]  They don't want you out there working.
[01:03:05.516 --> 01:03:06.897]  They don't want me working.
[01:03:06.897 --> 01:03:08.677]  They want machines doing everything.
[01:03:08.677 --> 01:03:12.759]  So you can go hide out in your 4x4 apartment and everything will be okay.
[01:03:12.759 --> 01:03:13.840]  Everything will be tolerant.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.100]  Everything will be just fine.
[01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:16.981]  The corptocracy is in control.
[01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:17.422]  And guess what?
[01:03:17.422 --> 01:03:18.862]  We're spying on everybody.
[01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:19.943]  We've got cameras everywhere.
[01:03:19.943 --> 01:03:22.704]  So we'll make sure that you're safe as long as you don't leave your apartment.
[01:03:23.064 --> 01:03:25.225]  That's the world that they want to create.
[01:03:25.225 --> 01:03:36.252]  And if people can actually recognize that that is what's going on here, if they can understand that this is nothing more than a global power grab to establish a world government, that's what they're talking about in their phones.
[01:03:36.252 --> 01:03:37.393]  That is why they're meeting.
[01:03:37.393 --> 01:03:39.154]  That is why they have to stop Donald Trump.
[01:03:39.154 --> 01:03:41.535]  That's why they're ticked off that he stopped the TPP.
[01:03:41.535 --> 01:03:43.796]  That's why they're ticked off he wants to get out of NATO.
[01:03:43.796 --> 01:03:46.498]  That's why they're ticked off he removed us from the Climate Paris Agreement.
[01:03:47.038 --> 01:03:51.022]  And I forget who said this, but somebody said this when we were driving up here in the car today.
[01:03:51.022 --> 01:03:58.047]  If they really cared about the planet, then they would make a deal with Trump to get us back into the climate agreement.
[01:03:58.047 --> 01:03:59.008]  But that's not what it's about.
[01:03:59.008 --> 01:04:00.149]  It's not about the planet.
[01:04:00.149 --> 01:04:11.078]  If it was about the planet, Leonardo DiCaprio wouldn't have a 50-foot yacht that sails across the ocean spewing more global warming than, you know, a car that travels to work for a week.
[01:04:11.078 --> 01:04:13.120]  So it's completely a farce.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.681]  It's nothing more than a power grab.
[01:04:16.315 --> 01:04:22.758]  I just think it's amazing how these people get to have this meeting and not even get asked questions about it.
[01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:25.379]  Again, like I said, Lindsey Graham's on Fox News today.
[01:04:25.379 --> 01:04:26.399]  Zero questions.
[01:04:26.399 --> 01:04:28.840]  Not even one mention of Bilderberg.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:33.382]  How is that possible when the number one agenda at the Bilderberg is to address President Trump?
[01:04:33.382 --> 01:04:34.362]  And let's expand on that.
[01:04:34.362 --> 01:04:39.864]  They've been wanting a carbon tax since Kinley thought it up 30 years ago, 27 years ago with Al Gore.
[01:04:39.864 --> 01:04:40.685]  That's all on record.
[01:04:41.601 --> 01:04:46.402]  They had congressional hearings, but now, and he'd be before Congress six, seven years ago, he'd say, there's no carbon tax.
[01:04:46.402 --> 01:04:48.983]  There's no... They go, it's in the Paris Treaty.
[01:04:48.983 --> 01:04:49.863]  He'd go, no, it's not.
[01:04:49.863 --> 01:04:51.384]  Oh, but I saw Al Gore's movie in 2008.
[01:04:51.384 --> 01:04:53.324]  It told me polar bears can't swim.
[01:04:53.324 --> 01:04:54.765]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:04:54.765 --> 01:04:56.165]  It's just a total scam.
[01:04:56.165 --> 01:04:57.486]  It's unbelievable.
[01:04:57.486 --> 01:04:57.966]  We'll be back.
[01:04:57.966 --> 01:04:58.586]  Thank you, Ellen.
[01:04:58.586 --> 01:04:58.726]  Wow.
[01:05:01.334 --> 01:05:07.702]  Well folks, it seems like life on the D-list, our decapitation list, isn't what it's all cracked up to be.
[01:05:07.702 --> 01:05:14.009]  You've seen the now infamous images of comedian Kathy Griffin holding up the mock head of Donald Trump.
[01:05:14.009 --> 01:05:19.155]  And you've seen the endless news stories of her apologizing, her being called out by the left and right.
[01:05:19.355 --> 01:05:21.776]  And losing some of her lucrative paying gigs.
[01:05:21.776 --> 01:05:22.236]  That's right.
[01:05:22.236 --> 01:05:27.318]  During this press conference, they're also going to announce her true motivation behind the photo shoot.
[01:05:27.318 --> 01:05:30.179]  Well, it doesn't really matter what your motivation was, Cathy.
[01:05:30.179 --> 01:05:31.520]  That's a mute point at this time.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.301]  And now we see the true response of the liberals.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.921]  I'm a victim!
[01:05:36.921 --> 01:05:42.823]  That's right, Kathy Griffin's gonna hold a press conference to complain about bullying from the Trump family.
[01:05:42.823 --> 01:05:45.004]  She should be lucky people are even talking about her.
[01:05:45.004 --> 01:05:52.627]  Please, for the sake of America, shut your piehole, crawl back into your she-lobbed lair, and just be happy that tweets are the only thing coming your way.
[01:05:52.627 --> 01:05:56.169]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:05:56.169 --> 01:05:59.470]  And ask yourself, what are you doing to wake up minds?
[01:06:01.121 --> 01:06:11.724]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:06:11.724 --> 01:06:13.784]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:06:13.784 --> 01:06:16.645]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:06:16.645 --> 01:06:18.126]  It's made in the USA.
[01:06:18.126 --> 01:06:24.967]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the inflow war.
[01:06:24.967 --> 01:06:26.188]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:06:27.028 --> 01:06:36.735]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:06:36.735 --> 01:06:53.567]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:06:53.567 --> 01:06:56.729]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:06:56.889 --> 01:07:01.010]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a Z-Field at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:02.610]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:05.191]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemistry.
[01:07:05.191 --> 01:07:12.692]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[01:07:31.177 --> 01:07:41.380]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:43.421]  And this part is most important.
[01:07:43.421 --> 01:07:49.883]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:07:50.223 --> 01:07:51.665]  That means it's clean.
[01:07:51.665 --> 01:07:52.807]  That means it's pure.
[01:07:52.807 --> 01:07:55.711]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[01:07:55.711 --> 01:07:58.495]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:07:58.495 --> 01:08:00.137]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:17.726]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:17.726 --> 01:08:23.030]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing till they got a hold of me.
[01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:28.314]  I opened doors for little old ladies.
[01:08:28.314 --> 01:08:30.716]  I held the blind to see.
[01:08:30.716 --> 01:08:37.042]  I got no friends cause they read the papers.
[01:08:37.042 --> 01:08:38.363]  They can't be seen.
[01:08:45.649 --> 01:08:48.431]  No more Mr. Nice Guy.
[01:08:48.431 --> 01:09:03.199]  So, we've got Trump coming out, one of the most historic speeches ever by a president, killing the main funding mechanism and the regulatory control system of the private corporate global government developed by Enron and Ken Lay and N.M.
[01:09:03.199 --> 01:09:04.319]  Rothschild.
[01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:06.621]  You can search engine, Ken Lay, N.M.
[01:09:06.621 --> 01:09:10.583]  Rothschild, got together in the late 80s when it was Senator Al Gore,
[01:09:11.343 --> 01:09:14.445]  And they cooked up the global carbon tax.
[01:09:14.445 --> 01:09:16.486]  Not a Tobin digital money tax.
[01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.147]  Not a wellhead tax.
[01:09:18.147 --> 01:09:21.649]  But the first global tax is to be carbon.
[01:09:21.649 --> 01:09:22.870]  How do you push a carbon tax?
[01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:23.530]  A global government?
[01:09:23.530 --> 01:09:25.331]  A global regulatory system?
[01:09:25.331 --> 01:09:26.252]  Save the Earth.
[01:09:26.252 --> 01:09:27.773]  Also for global pandemics.
[01:09:27.773 --> 01:09:31.535]  And now they're all saying, we need global government for pandemics.
[01:09:31.535 --> 01:09:34.677]  We need global government for carbon to save the Earth.
[01:09:35.834 --> 01:09:45.817]  We need to all have our private jumbo jets and helicopters and armed guards and taxpayer-paid-for stuff, whether it's in Switzerland, like footage we're showing TV viewers right now, or whether it's Chantilly, Virginia.
[01:09:45.817 --> 01:09:54.539]  Every four years, for the last three times, they met there previously in the 80s, they meet in Chantilly, Virginia, our reporters are there.
[01:09:54.539 --> 01:10:03.662]  So contrast Trump giving this globalist killing speech, I represent the people of Pittsburgh, not Paris, juxtaposing that
[01:10:06.069 --> 01:10:13.899]  With the media saying there's no global government now being forced to do it, now forced to admit global governments in crisis, while the very global government...
[01:10:14.764 --> 01:10:17.586]  Bilderberg is one of the main original meeting houses of that.
[01:10:17.586 --> 01:10:20.968]  Government and private interest meeting, trying to push world government.
[01:10:20.968 --> 01:10:24.810]  And Bilderberg itself has leaked to the BBC that they created the EU.
[01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:26.271]  That they helped create so much more.
[01:10:26.271 --> 01:10:32.715]  That the old Nazi money of Europe, at the end of World War II, began to have these secret meetings with Western intelligence.
[01:10:32.715 --> 01:10:40.320]  And then by 1954, in Oosterbeek, Holland, they met at Bilderberg Hotel and gave it the official name of Club Bilderberg.
[01:10:42.199 --> 01:10:44.520]  And so that's the reality.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:47.761]  And how big a deal is this?
[01:10:47.761 --> 01:10:48.641]  How far have we come?
[01:10:48.641 --> 01:10:50.542]  Because we tend to not savor our successes.
[01:10:50.542 --> 01:10:52.323]  I'm the worst about it.
[01:10:52.323 --> 01:10:53.623]  Because I'm mission-oriented.
[01:10:53.623 --> 01:10:55.604]  It isn't about being famous or making money.
[01:10:55.604 --> 01:11:00.906]  Making money means we can be strong, expand, and not be destroyed by globalist lawsuits and, you know, things like that.
[01:11:03.254 --> 01:11:04.275]  But that's not our goal.
[01:11:04.275 --> 01:11:05.875]  Our goal is to build a better world.
[01:11:05.875 --> 01:11:09.397]  To defeat these social engineers who think they're better than us.
[01:11:09.397 --> 01:11:10.798]  These bullies.
[01:11:10.798 --> 01:11:23.305]  And the left, and their control, and No White Week, you know, or Weekend, and colleges, and just all the racism that the central government is spewing to reject their anti-family, anti-God program.
[01:11:23.305 --> 01:11:24.146]  It's a spiritual thing.
[01:11:24.146 --> 01:11:26.447]  We spiritually feel what they're doing.
[01:11:26.447 --> 01:11:27.508]  We see what they're doing.
[01:11:27.508 --> 01:11:29.169]  We coldly analyze what we're doing.
[01:11:29.169 --> 01:11:31.390]  We realize it's an existential threat to humanity.
[01:11:32.523 --> 01:11:36.045]  So Soros was in the news saying Trump is an existential threat to the EU.
[01:11:36.045 --> 01:11:37.326]  He means what Trump represents.
[01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:41.709]  Hillary, the same day, said InfoWars lost me the election.
[01:11:41.709 --> 01:11:44.150]  Dark Heart Jones is the enemy.
[01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:48.773]  She's shooting up her back beam, folks, when she does that.
[01:11:48.773 --> 01:11:50.735]  And I understand that.
[01:11:50.735 --> 01:11:55.317]  And there's a lot of evil attacks on InfoWars, a lot of bad energy they're throwing our way.
[01:11:55.317 --> 01:11:59.200]  That's why your prayers are more important than ever, because I can handle it.
[01:12:01.111 --> 01:12:03.413]  Some people around me, quite frankly, can't.
[01:12:03.413 --> 01:12:05.174]  But this is a spiritual war.
[01:12:05.174 --> 01:12:07.096]  That's why we need your prayers more than ever.
[01:12:07.096 --> 01:12:18.163]  David Knight from Chantilly, Virginia, right outside where they've set up makeshift fences around the five-star Marriott Conference Center nearby the golf course there.
[01:12:18.163 --> 01:12:19.584]  They've got that all blocked up.
[01:12:19.584 --> 01:12:21.986]  I want to get your analysis of witnessing this.
[01:12:21.986 --> 01:12:24.568]  You've covered Bilderberg, obviously in Europe as well.
[01:12:24.568 --> 01:12:26.750]  You've covered Bilderberg many times for InfoWars.
[01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.551]  David Knight reporting for InfoWars.com.
[01:12:29.707 --> 01:12:35.269]  David Knight here at Bilderberg 2017, and Alex, as you can see here, this is the only thing that is visible.
[01:12:35.269 --> 01:12:36.689]  A few of these orange barricades.
[01:12:36.689 --> 01:12:40.730]  For people who are driving by, it looks like maybe there's some construction going on here.
[01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:44.111]  And of course, nothing can be seen because of the heavy forestation around the perimeter.
[01:12:44.111 --> 01:12:47.232]  The police will even hang back and stand behind the walls.
[01:12:47.232 --> 01:12:50.934]  It's a very subtle, behind-the-scenes presence.
[01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:55.215]  Here in the suburbs, people don't even know that these world leaders are meeting.
[01:12:55.215 --> 01:12:57.015]  And that's the essence of this, Alex.
[01:12:57.015 --> 01:12:58.556]  It's the secrecy.
[01:12:59.237 --> 01:13:03.585]  Yeah, normally when they have a G8, this is more important than a G8 or a G20.
[01:13:03.585 --> 01:13:04.908]  It's huge news.
[01:13:04.908 --> 01:13:06.652]  This is a secret G20 basically.
[01:13:07.506 --> 01:13:08.147]  That's right.
[01:13:08.147 --> 01:13:11.049]  Because these are really the people who make the decisions.
[01:13:11.049 --> 01:13:12.730]  You know, we had the headlines earlier today.
[01:13:12.730 --> 01:13:15.372]  You saw the clip on the Drudge Report.
[01:13:15.372 --> 01:13:17.634]  Earth says to Trump, F you.
[01:13:17.634 --> 01:13:19.416]  Well, they don't speak for the Earth.
[01:13:19.416 --> 01:13:25.961]  And quite frankly, these people, even the governments, the world government or the individual governments, they're not really in charge either.
[01:13:25.961 --> 01:13:32.866]  It's the transnational, the multinational corporations, and they're here telling these various government officials what's going to happen.
[01:13:32.866 --> 01:13:35.849]  And as they have quietly taken over this hotel,
[01:13:36.556 --> 01:13:36.816]  I don't know.
[01:14:00.854 --> 01:14:02.676]  There was never any debate about this.
[01:14:02.676 --> 01:14:04.557]  Donald Trump has opposed this from the beginning.
[01:14:04.557 --> 01:14:07.900]  He never had anything good to say for the climate treaty.
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:08.540]  Good!
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.361]  I'm happy he did that.
[01:14:09.361 --> 01:14:10.562]  He campaigned against it.
[01:14:10.562 --> 01:14:13.985]  He was very frank about the problems with this.
[01:14:13.985 --> 01:14:18.008]  And understand, we've talked a lot about the science, and we can have that scientific debate.
[01:14:18.568 --> 01:14:24.075]  Let's understand, as you pointed out earlier, this is not about saving the earth.
[01:14:24.075 --> 01:14:29.002]  This is about transferring money and it's about setting up a crony corporate tax.
[01:14:29.002 --> 01:14:31.945]  It's about establishing the funding for a world government.
[01:14:31.945 --> 01:14:33.287]  That's what this is truly about.
[01:14:33.287 --> 01:14:34.629]  If they wanted to save the world,
[01:14:35.069 --> 01:14:49.338]  They wouldn't give China the ability, the number one polluter according to them, the ability to continue to increase their emissions until 2030 and only then begin to do some token cuts when they do massive cuts to the US, to Western Europe.
[01:14:49.338 --> 01:15:02.567]  India signed onto this thing and they didn't even commit to any cuts and they committed to looking at their carbon density at some point in the future but not to any cuts and the key thing that we have to understand here as they're pushing back against this
[01:15:03.087 --> 01:15:08.808]  Is that the signing that Obama did at the time, he said, I'm going to ratify this myself.
[01:15:08.808 --> 01:15:10.349]  I'm not going to go to the Senate.
[01:15:10.349 --> 01:15:12.909]  So he has no effect here.
[01:15:12.909 --> 01:15:20.231]  Clearly, when Donald Trump is talking about this, he said, I'm not going to enforce any of these agreed limitations on our economy, on our energy use.
[01:15:20.231 --> 01:15:24.132]  You have to understand that they are trying to make you pay for your energy.
[01:15:24.685 --> 01:15:32.541]  The same way that the Federal Reserve, which actually has a foreigner sitting on the New York Fed chair.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:41.525]  You have to understand that these people who have been renting us our money all of this time, now want to rent us our energy.
[01:15:41.525 --> 01:15:43.326]  That's what these carbon taxes are about.
[01:15:43.326 --> 01:15:45.768]  They're an indulgence that you have to pay to the world government.
[01:15:45.768 --> 01:15:47.169]  That's why the Pope is signing on to this.
[01:15:47.169 --> 01:15:48.690]  He understands indulgences.
[01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:51.412]  You have to pay them for the sin of using energy.
[01:15:51.412 --> 01:15:56.035]  You want to heat your home, you want to cool your home, you want to travel somewhere, you will pay these people.
[01:15:56.035 --> 01:15:58.257]  Like Elon Musk, who is so upset about this.
[01:15:58.257 --> 01:16:00.679]  His business model is carbon taxes.
[01:16:00.679 --> 01:16:02.320]  His business model is carbon credits.
[01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:07.378]  He doesn't make any money selling these cars that he sells to people who have a net worth of $250,000.
[01:16:07.378 --> 01:16:12.161]  He gets his subsidies for the cars when he manufactures them.
[01:16:12.161 --> 01:16:13.782]  He gets subsidized plants.
[01:16:13.782 --> 01:16:16.364]  He gets subsidization on the sale of the car.
[01:16:16.364 --> 01:16:18.205]  And the people who buy it get subsidized.
[01:16:18.205 --> 01:16:19.726]  And he still loses money.
[01:16:19.726 --> 01:16:27.511]  Last year, up to May of 2016, he had lost $400 million even though he's getting these massive subsidies.
[01:16:27.511 --> 01:16:29.513]  That's why these people are so upset.
[01:16:29.513 --> 01:16:32.835]  But Alex, there's not only opposition from outside the Trump administration.
[01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:36.056]  There's opposition, of course, inside the Trump administration.
[01:16:36.056 --> 01:16:37.396]  Wilbur Ross is here.
[01:16:37.396 --> 01:16:41.637]  He is a former senior managing director at Rothschild Bank.
[01:16:41.637 --> 01:16:50.459]  And the day before this began, he told Foreign Policy Magazine reported that he said, hey, we're going to take another look at TTIP.
[01:16:50.459 --> 01:16:56.501]  And the headline that they had was Wilbur Ross breathes new life into TTIP.
[01:16:56.501 --> 01:17:01.222]  And what he said was that we have to go through the European Union
[01:17:02.017 --> 01:17:05.620]  For any economic negotiations, any trade negotiations.
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:14.946]  Again, establishing this supranational authority vis-a-vis Europe saying that we're not going to be negotiating with individual companies.
[01:17:14.946 --> 01:17:16.427]  He said legally that's what we have to do.
[01:17:16.427 --> 01:17:26.234]  So basically he's dumping on the sovereignty of the individual European states and then upholding the European Union at the same time saying that they're going to go back to TTIP.
[01:17:26.234 --> 01:17:31.378]  We have to understand the three legs of control that the globalists are doing are the open borders,
[01:17:31.778 --> 01:17:38.404]  These economic trade agreements, which they then spin into political control, and that's the TTP and the TTIP.
[01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:42.007]  And of course, Donald Trump killed the TTP on day one.
[01:17:42.007 --> 01:17:43.688]  That's a Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[01:17:43.688 --> 01:17:49.193]  Nothing was said about the TTIP until Wilbur Ross brought it up before he came here to Bilderberg.
[01:17:49.193 --> 01:17:53.637]  So there's competition within Donald Trump's cabinet.
[01:17:53.637 --> 01:17:55.318]  People who are still trying to push against that.
[01:17:55.318 --> 01:17:57.220]  That's what we're concerned about as we look at this.
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.782]  But so far, Donald Trump has done the right thing.
[01:17:59.782 --> 01:18:07.108]  He's opposed them on these trade agreements, he's opposed them on the climate agreements, and he's back now saying we're going to continue to fight them on the borders.
[01:18:07.108 --> 01:18:09.050]  So he's delivering, and let's stop right there.
[01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:16.176]  I always said this, and the media made a big joke out of it, that turned into a meme viewed more than 30 million times online, that, you know, use Mordor.
[01:18:16.176 --> 01:18:24.503]  I don't care if Trump has goblin guides going into the mines of Moria or going into one of these, you know, subterranean pits of the swamp.
[01:18:25.287 --> 01:18:28.831]  Before he called it a swamp, I was calling it Mordor and, you know, the goblin pits.
[01:18:28.831 --> 01:18:30.532]  I think the swamp is probably a better analogy.
[01:18:30.532 --> 01:18:33.375]  More folks know what a swamp is versus the world of J.R.R.
[01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:34.256]  Tolkien.
[01:18:34.256 --> 01:18:41.283]  But I said, I don't care if he goes into a goblin pit with a goblin guide and goblins vomit on him and he cuts them up and he's got goblin blood on him.
[01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:43.405]  I don't want to catch him kissing goblins.
[01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:47.107]  And then, of course, you know, I don't want to catch him in bed with a goblin.
[01:18:47.107 --> 01:18:49.927]  And so they made a big joke that I'm concerned he's having sex with goblins.
[01:18:49.927 --> 01:18:51.568]  Jones is totally insane.
[01:18:51.568 --> 01:18:56.209]  Thinking their readers don't know what an analogy is, or an allegory, or a parallel, or a parable.
[01:18:56.209 --> 01:18:59.429]  But so far, he's been using the goblins.
[01:18:59.429 --> 01:19:01.950]  About 90% of the time, he's winning.
[01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:04.850]  He's actually co-opted the goblins masterfully.
[01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:07.871]  They all want to slit his throat, but they all respect him.
[01:19:07.871 --> 01:19:10.872]  And so, so far, he's keeping them on a short shot collar.
[01:19:12.032 --> 01:19:15.113]  Donald Trump has the New World Order on a shock collar right now.
[01:19:15.113 --> 01:19:16.794]  He has them on a shock collar.
[01:19:16.794 --> 01:19:18.135]  The goblins are very upsetting.
[01:19:18.135 --> 01:19:21.336]  You're talking about collars and people on leashes.
[01:19:21.336 --> 01:19:27.439]  It was interesting to see Macron, who was the big hope of the EU, and again promoting
[01:19:28.203 --> 01:19:28.383]  I think?
[01:19:58.264 --> 01:19:59.780]  That's right, let's talk more about it straight ahead.
[01:20:01.109 --> 01:20:03.710]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:04.771]  Get back to nature.

[01:21:14.851 --> 01:21:21.618]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about, is those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.

[01:22:04.863 --> 01:22:08.623]  A sinister murder in Oregon that is still unsolved and shrouded in mystery.
[01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:10.184]  Yet no one seems to care.
[01:22:10.184 --> 01:22:12.324]  Are the Oregon police covering something up?
[01:22:12.324 --> 01:22:14.804]  Are Illuminati and the New World Order involved?
[01:22:14.804 --> 01:22:17.025]  Who really killed Tiffany Jenks?
[01:22:17.025 --> 01:22:18.585]  A story waiting to be told.
[01:22:18.585 --> 01:22:20.305]  A story that will not go away.

[01:23:57.685 --> 01:24:10.431]  You know, I'm sitting here during the break.
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:16.165]  Thinking about times in history where more has been happening, and I can't think of it.
[01:24:16.165 --> 01:24:26.094]  And the fact that private corporate interest, for basically a hundred years, have tried to build this private corporate world government on the British Empire model.
[01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:29.597]  And stealth implementation.
[01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:36.384]  And the fact that they tried to stonewall from the days of Barry Goldwater, 45, 50 years ago, and that they failed.
[01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:45.168]  And that Ron Paul and Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan and Pat Buchanan and Matt Drudge and Alex Jones and David Knight.
[01:24:46.451 --> 01:25:13.428]  And everybody else that opposed this private, arrogant, fake, liberal, savior-of-the-earth, global government, Hollywood, PR, BS machine, that it's identified as unelected, it's identified as authoritarian, it's identified as above-the-law, tax-exempt, diplomatically immune, the new royalty, it's identified as anti-human, it's identified as anti-prosperity, it's identified as using 1860s eugenics as its operating system,
[01:25:14.932 --> 01:25:19.474]  I mean, Hitler was literally a spinoff of this thing.
[01:25:19.474 --> 01:25:23.755]  Kaiserville Home Institute, Cold Springs Harbor, New York.
[01:25:23.755 --> 01:25:24.835]  Look up these terms.
[01:25:24.835 --> 01:25:26.356]  I'm giving you the bedrock.
[01:25:26.356 --> 01:25:28.297]  And not like I'm some grand poobah.
[01:25:28.297 --> 01:25:35.039]  The history is a fact that IBM was set up to learn how to exterminate everybody who wasn't white.
[01:25:37.244 --> 01:25:43.687]  You look at IBM today, it funds the Black Lives Matter, the cop killer groups, the open borders groups, because they want us all in each other's throats.
[01:25:43.687 --> 01:25:49.710]  They've gone from just hating the minorities, who are the majority, to hating everybody.
[01:25:49.710 --> 01:25:51.170]  And I don't want to be part of it.
[01:25:51.170 --> 01:25:53.471]  If you're white, I don't want you sterilized with Gardasil.
[01:25:53.471 --> 01:25:55.873]  If you're Hispanic, I don't want you sterilized.
[01:25:55.873 --> 01:25:58.814]  Does that mean I want to be beat on the head with a Mexican flag and called a gringo?
[01:25:58.814 --> 01:25:59.434]  No.
[01:25:59.434 --> 01:26:01.155]  But I don't hate you as a human.
[01:26:01.155 --> 01:26:02.896]  I want you to be my friend.
[01:26:04.093 --> 01:26:06.253]  And the psychopaths call me a schmuck.
[01:26:06.253 --> 01:26:11.835]  They go, the general public's a bunch of animals, whether they be a poor white person, or a poor black person, or a poor Hispanic person.
[01:26:11.835 --> 01:26:14.555]  Stop trying, Alex.
[01:26:14.555 --> 01:26:16.316]  I have the knowledge the globalists have.
[01:26:16.316 --> 01:26:19.036]  I'm simply trying to give it to you.
[01:26:19.036 --> 01:26:20.837]  And most of the audience knows more than I do.
[01:26:20.837 --> 01:26:21.877]  That's what's scary.
[01:26:21.877 --> 01:26:24.838]  If you're just reality-based, Bilderberg's real.
[01:26:24.838 --> 01:26:26.338]  The IMF, the World Bank's real.
[01:26:26.338 --> 01:26:27.338]  The TPP's real.
[01:26:27.338 --> 01:26:29.679]  It's all unelected.
[01:26:29.679 --> 01:26:30.599]  World government's real.
[01:26:31.991 --> 01:26:33.672]  Bilderberg's real.
[01:26:33.672 --> 01:26:36.655]  Trump is devastating it for real.
[01:26:36.655 --> 01:26:40.137]  And you got some of Trump's people going to Bilderberg.
[01:26:40.137 --> 01:26:41.759]  I think that violates the Logan Act.
[01:26:41.759 --> 01:26:43.280]  But Trump's all about going to meetings.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.562]  He says he'll meet with Kim Jong-un, anybody.
[01:26:45.562 --> 01:26:49.865]  So I get some of his people who have good policies, but they're going to the meetings trying to influence things.
[01:26:49.865 --> 01:26:50.906]  He's all about coming to the table.
[01:26:53.336 --> 01:26:56.218]  But the point is, maybe they'll come out and tell us what happened at these events.
[01:26:56.218 --> 01:27:01.462]  But some listeners are like, hey, a couple of his people, the word is McMaster's going.
[01:27:01.462 --> 01:27:02.903]  Well, McMaster goes to these meetings.
[01:27:02.903 --> 01:27:04.464]  I don't really like McMaster.
[01:27:04.464 --> 01:27:07.266]  But what I really care about is what Trump actually does.
[01:27:07.266 --> 01:27:09.288]  What his minions do is secondary.
[01:27:09.288 --> 01:27:12.230]  Those are, those are his swamp creature guides.
[01:27:12.230 --> 01:27:13.631]  Those are, that's Gollum.
[01:27:13.631 --> 01:27:20.156]  McMaster and people like Gollum, again, helping, you know, the hobbits in the Mordor to throw the ring into the crack of doom.
[01:27:21.156 --> 01:27:22.177]  Keep using that allegory.
[01:27:22.177 --> 01:27:25.500]  Go ahead, David, not with other points.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:26.480]  Yeah, you're right, Alex.
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:31.864]  We got Wilbur Gollum Ross, just saying that, hey, we never got out of TTIP.
[01:27:31.864 --> 01:27:35.927]  So we have to understand, he's facing opposition within and without.
[01:27:35.927 --> 01:27:37.849]  But as we just saw with the Paris Climate Treaty,
[01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:43.986]  The people who lost in that fight inside the administration said he was never really paying any attention to us.
[01:27:43.986 --> 01:27:46.149]  He was pushing back against that from day one.
[01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:47.290]  So that's good news.
[01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:52.677]  Now, the key here, Alex, is I think as we look at the way that they have opposed him... Well, that's it.
[01:27:52.677 --> 01:27:54.700]  He's bringing globalists in to keep an eye on them.
[01:27:55.365 --> 01:28:03.091]  Yeah, the way that they have opposed him in terms of saying, hey, we've got all of these secret meetings, all of these back channels.
[01:28:03.091 --> 01:28:05.892]  You know, whenever the Democrats do it, it's not a back channel, okay?
[01:28:05.892 --> 01:28:07.093]  They're just trying to open things up.
[01:28:07.093 --> 01:28:10.796]  But when somebody else does it, they do dossiers, they do back channels and so forth.
[01:28:11.096 --> 01:28:17.003]  Look, if you want to investigate something, they come out and they make all these innuendos and never make any clear allegations.
[01:28:17.003 --> 01:28:25.372]  If you want to investigate some secret meetings between powerful people that violate ethics, violate the law, investigate Bilderberg!
[01:28:25.913 --> 01:28:27.634]  This is the elephant in the room.
[01:28:27.634 --> 01:28:28.174]  Oh my gosh.
[01:28:28.174 --> 01:28:30.655]  I know you filed reports on this, but this is the angle.
[01:28:30.655 --> 01:28:31.435]  I totally missed it.
[01:28:31.435 --> 01:28:32.275]  You're right.
[01:28:32.275 --> 01:28:39.738]  They're claiming all this secret Russian collusion when there is none, because Trump might have been at the same hotel in a public convening where some Russian ambassador was.
[01:28:39.738 --> 01:28:41.078]  That happens in D.C.
[01:28:41.078 --> 01:28:41.938]  That's not the issue.
[01:28:41.938 --> 01:28:48.180]  You've got the big corporate global government, leaders from China, you name it, meeting in secret with our politicians.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:49.941]  This is the secret meeting.
[01:28:49.941 --> 01:28:50.541]  Exactly.
[01:28:50.541 --> 01:28:53.982]  And this is the very group pointing the fingers at Trump like he's done something wrong.
[01:28:53.982 --> 01:28:55.303]  Trump should call out Bilderberg.
[01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:59.647]  At the same time, Bilderberg is starting, which they totally ignore.
[01:28:59.647 --> 01:29:03.791]  They're trying to ferret out a new meeting that they think might have happened between a U.S.
[01:29:03.791 --> 01:29:06.434]  Senator Sessions and a Russian ambassador.
[01:29:06.434 --> 01:29:08.236]  It's like, but what about this?
[01:29:08.236 --> 01:29:08.736]  What about this?
[01:29:08.736 --> 01:29:09.797]  Why aren't you looking at this?
[01:29:09.797 --> 01:29:10.998]  Why aren't you covering this?
[01:29:10.998 --> 01:29:12.500]  This is a true issue.
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:14.882]  And for the listeners, for the people who are waking up, Alex,
[01:29:15.422 --> 01:29:17.203]  This is the Rosetta Stone.
[01:29:17.203 --> 01:29:25.746]  This is when they realize that the mainstream media and the establishment politicians have a phony agenda, a hidden agenda, just like Bilderberg.
[01:29:25.746 --> 01:29:28.367]  This is the physical manifestation of that agenda.
[01:29:29.608 --> 01:29:30.468]  You're absolutely right.
[01:29:30.468 --> 01:29:31.128]  Thank you, David Knight.
[01:29:31.128 --> 01:29:35.610]  We'll keep watching your filed reports at InfoWars.com and on Twitter at RealAlexJones.
[01:29:35.610 --> 01:29:39.330]  Thank you for Owen and the rest of the great team there on the ground.
[01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:44.972]  We'll be right back on the other side with a bunch of clips, breaking news and analysis, and a special guest.
[01:29:44.972 --> 01:29:48.293]  Please spread the link, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:29:48.293 --> 01:29:50.353]  The enemy hates it.
[01:29:50.353 --> 01:29:51.754]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.754 --> 01:29:54.294]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.294 --> 01:29:56.955]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.494 --> 01:30:07.879]  Well folks, it seems like life on the D-list, our decapitation list, isn't what it's all cracked up to be.
[01:30:07.879 --> 01:30:21.649]  You've seen the now infamous images of comedian Kathy Griffin holding up the mock head of Donald Trump, and you've seen the endless news stories of her apologizing, her being called out by the left and right, and losing some of her lucrative paying gigs.
[01:30:21.929 --> 01:30:22.390]  That's right.
[01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:27.496]  During this press conference, they're also going to announce her true motivation behind the photo shoot.
[01:30:27.496 --> 01:30:30.340]  Well, it doesn't really matter what your motivation was, Cathy.
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:31.682]  That's a mute point at this time.
[01:30:31.682 --> 01:30:34.485]  And now we see the true response of the liberals.
[01:30:35.291 --> 01:30:37.091]  I'm a victim!
[01:30:37.091 --> 01:30:42.973]  That's right, Kathy Griffin's going to hold a press conference to complain about bullying from the Trump family.
[01:30:42.973 --> 01:30:45.153]  She should be lucky people are even talking about her.
[01:30:45.153 --> 01:30:52.795]  Please, for the sake of America, shut your piehole, crawl back into your she-lob lair, and just be happy that tweets are the only thing coming your way.
[01:30:52.795 --> 01:30:56.336]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:30:56.336 --> 01:30:59.617]  And ask yourself, what are you doing to wake up minds?
[01:31:04.175 --> 01:31:05.576]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[01:31:05.576 --> 01:31:07.818]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:31:07.818 --> 01:31:08.278]  Great!
[01:31:08.278 --> 01:31:09.399]  Hey, thank you so much.
[01:31:09.399 --> 01:31:13.923]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[01:31:13.923 --> 01:31:15.624]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[01:31:15.624 --> 01:31:23.210]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[01:31:23.210 --> 01:31:24.031]  Wow, thank you.
[01:31:24.031 --> 01:31:26.353]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[01:31:26.353 --> 01:31:27.994]  Which nutraceutical does he like best?
[01:31:28.234 --> 01:31:31.718]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[01:31:31.718 --> 01:31:32.999]  That's really incredible.
[01:31:32.999 --> 01:31:36.062]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:31:36.062 --> 01:31:37.403]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[01:31:37.403 --> 01:31:39.085]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:31:39.085 --> 01:31:40.326]  And I love you guys.
[01:31:40.326 --> 01:31:42.468]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[01:31:42.468 --> 01:31:49.355]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[01:31:49.355 --> 01:31:50.376]  You will love it.
[01:31:50.376 --> 01:31:52.198]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[01:31:52.498 --> 01:31:56.923]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:56.923 --> 01:31:57.784]  It's a win-win.
[01:31:57.784 --> 01:31:58.765]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:01.357 --> 01:32:03.318]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[01:32:03.318 --> 01:32:04.639]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:32:04.639 --> 01:32:05.839]  Why is this so good?
[01:32:05.839 --> 01:32:11.142]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:32:11.142 --> 01:32:24.669]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:32:24.669 --> 01:32:26.030]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:28.471]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:32:28.471 --> 01:32:31.032]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:32:31.032 --> 01:32:32.333]  These are all parasites.
[01:32:32.333 --> 01:32:33.454]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:32:33.454 --> 01:32:34.774]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:34.774 --> 01:32:39.277]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:32:39.277 --> 01:32:42.558]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:32:42.558 --> 01:32:45.620]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:46.681]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:32:46.681 --> 01:32:47.501]  Living Defense.
[01:32:47.501 --> 01:32:48.602]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:48.602 --> 01:32:49.622]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:32:49.622 --> 01:32:52.344]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:32:52.344 --> 01:32:52.544]  And, uh,
[01:32:53.204 --> 01:32:54.245]  You support the broadcast.
[01:32:54.245 --> 01:32:55.585]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:32:55.585 --> 01:32:57.827]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:32:57.827 --> 01:33:05.791]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:05.791 --> 01:33:12.675]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[01:33:12.675 --> 01:33:19.159]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[01:33:21.485 --> 01:33:44.992]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:44.992 --> 01:33:45.872]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:33:47.208 --> 01:33:49.250]  We launched a contest a couple days ago.
[01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:53.313]  Infowars.com forward slash contest with $200,000 in prizes.
[01:33:53.313 --> 01:33:56.416]  And I told you that it's up to my discretion, but I'd love to pay out on these.
[01:33:56.416 --> 01:34:02.661]  So, you know, if you go wearing an Infowars.com shirt and scream, Bill Clinton's a rapist, I think I'm going to go ahead and still pay $1,000.
[01:34:04.502 --> 01:34:13.465]  If you wear one of these shirts we're selling, it has Kathy Griffin on it and says CNN terrorist or CNN fake news, make your own shirt, make your own poster, I don't care, $1,000.
[01:34:13.465 --> 01:34:21.108]  You get Infowars.com repeatedly, verbally out over the air on national television, $2,500.
[01:34:21.108 --> 01:34:22.888]  It isn't even about the publicity we get.
[01:34:22.888 --> 01:34:25.189]  I want them to know it's me coming after them.
[01:34:26.374 --> 01:34:28.896]  They've already tried to destroy my life, destroy my family.
[01:34:28.896 --> 01:34:30.358]  Hillary came out and called me the dark heart.
[01:34:30.358 --> 01:34:39.686]  She came out two days ago, in front of a big group of Democrats, and said InfoWars lost her the election, and that I am commanding the Russians.
[01:34:39.686 --> 01:34:41.848]  Oh yeah, it's a five minute clip.
[01:34:41.848 --> 01:34:44.010]  She said, oh, the Russians don't understand America like this.
[01:34:44.010 --> 01:34:48.835]  InfoWars, that's coordinating, and then they coordinate with them, and then they drop the info.
[01:34:48.835 --> 01:34:52.118]  No, when they would drop the WikiLeaks, we would go search engine it.
[01:34:53.547 --> 01:34:57.590]  And use CTRL-F for keywords.
[01:34:57.590 --> 01:35:00.311]  And so we could search thousands of pages a second.
[01:35:00.311 --> 01:35:02.152]  Dumbo.
[01:35:02.152 --> 01:35:06.315]  And so the Russians weren't here going, psst, go look at page 791.
[01:35:06.315 --> 01:35:09.417]  We would search things like kids.
[01:35:09.417 --> 01:35:13.500]  Or we would search things like lies, or polls, or debate.
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:16.301]  And then we'd find you rigging the debates.
[01:35:16.301 --> 01:35:17.022]  And rigging the polls.
[01:35:17.022 --> 01:35:19.403]  But see, that's how you change the subject.
[01:35:19.403 --> 01:35:21.365]  We're going to James O'Keefe, who's being sued.
[01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:45.497]  I can't talk about it because there was a confidential settlement, but let's just say I was very pleased with the settlement with Chobani Yogurt, the owner of it, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York, and let's just say that when people got on the news, or fake news, like what's that guy's name, Stephen Colbert, said that cash on the bottom, oh that's BS on the bottom, buddy.
[01:35:45.497 --> 01:35:50.539]  I'm not going to get into which direction the cash was going, but it'd be news if you knew, wouldn't it?
[01:35:52.236 --> 01:35:58.880]  Once they figured out what I was going to do... We'll stop right there.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.142]  But let's just walk this back to our guest.
[01:36:03.142 --> 01:36:04.583]  James O'Keefe's only got about 10 minutes for this.
[01:36:04.583 --> 01:36:06.224]  ProjectVeritas.com.
[01:36:06.224 --> 01:36:17.851]  He's being sued for the videos of Democratic operatives talking about how they were going to go out and manipulate the election and get people to vote who'd already voted before and how no one could stop them.
[01:36:18.993 --> 01:36:22.514]  And so now he's being sued for a million dollars.
[01:36:22.514 --> 01:36:25.495]  And by the way, they have to say a million, it can be unlimited.
[01:36:25.495 --> 01:36:27.595]  People say, oh, you're only being sued for $10,000.
[01:36:27.595 --> 01:36:29.436]  It's the statute of the state you're sued in.
[01:36:29.436 --> 01:36:32.136]  In Idaho, it's $10,000 and then go to the moon.
[01:36:32.136 --> 01:36:34.597]  Well, where O'Keefe's being sued, it could be even higher than that.
[01:36:34.597 --> 01:36:37.358]  They have to hit a certain number.
[01:36:37.358 --> 01:36:42.239]  And so Democracy Partners Attacks Veritas launches $1 million federal lawsuit.
[01:36:43.573 --> 01:36:46.796]  And so that's where all of this is going, and he joins us.
[01:36:46.796 --> 01:36:47.636]  Remember the clips.
[01:36:47.636 --> 01:36:50.018]  Talk about game changer in the election.
[01:36:50.018 --> 01:36:53.001]  It's not true that I or you defeated Hillary.
[01:36:53.001 --> 01:36:59.726]  Veritas, Drudge, O'Keefe, all of us together, our resistance together defeated her, and their own actions defeated her.
[01:36:59.726 --> 01:37:01.948]  She's blamed 20 different groups!
[01:37:01.948 --> 01:37:08.813]  Veritas, Drudge, Infowars, the Russians, misogyny, racism, never!
[01:37:08.813 --> 01:37:10.835]  The fact that people are sick of her and her policies.
[01:37:12.062 --> 01:37:14.463]  So, James O'Keefe, thanks for joining us.
[01:37:14.463 --> 01:37:15.583]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[01:37:15.583 --> 01:37:17.924]  I think reality defeated Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:17.924 --> 01:37:20.384]  You know, the truth defeated Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:20.384 --> 01:37:30.807]  And now, just yesterday, it was announced a lawsuit, a million dollar lawsuit, against my team, Veritas, from this guy Bob Kramer, who's one of Barack Obama's close friends.
[01:37:31.602 --> 01:37:33.123]  We're basically retaliating.
[01:37:33.123 --> 01:37:46.448]  We exposed the fraud during the election, we exposed the four-part series, sending shockwaves to the DNC about voter fraud, use of dark money from an overseas donor to arrange these types of things.
[01:37:46.448 --> 01:37:49.409]  So they sued me for a million dollars and they want to shut us down.
[01:37:49.409 --> 01:37:55.531]  Then I get calls from Politico, I get calls from all these mainstream outlets that suddenly want to talk to me now that I'm being sued.
[01:37:56.241 --> 01:37:58.663]  And I want to know who's funding this lawsuit.
[01:37:58.663 --> 01:38:01.565]  I've said that over my dead body will I ever shut up.
[01:38:01.565 --> 01:38:08.589]  And I'm going to, I'm actually hiring over a dozen undercover journalists to start next week in response to this.
[01:38:08.589 --> 01:38:15.914]  But Bob Kramer, Barack Obama's friend and the person Hillary Clinton had to fire, is now suing me for a million dollars for the videos that we did during the election.
[01:38:16.658 --> 01:38:23.301]  Now, you're meeting with him at his offices, you're meeting with him at restaurants, you're an undercover journalist, you're clearly covered by this.
[01:38:23.301 --> 01:38:27.423]  They persecuted the pro-lifers that went behind the scenes in private medical facilities.
[01:38:27.423 --> 01:38:37.308]  But if you're exposing a crime, obviously then you are, according to law, no longer under medical rules or things like that because you're exposing corruption.
[01:38:37.308 --> 01:38:41.811]  But clearly you're in public places at restaurants and in hotel lobbies with this guy.
[01:38:42.711 --> 01:38:49.093]  And we can play the clips again where he is just saying outrageous stuff about the election and how he's going to do this and how he's going to do that.
[01:38:49.093 --> 01:38:50.673]  You talk to his minions.
[01:38:50.673 --> 01:38:52.374]  This is like award-winning stuff you did.
[01:38:52.374 --> 01:38:56.275]  I mean, this is like, this is beyond stuff in movies, what you pulled off with your teams.
[01:38:56.275 --> 01:39:05.178]  So to me, this is about just silencing you, but more importantly, intimidating other people that, oh look, we'll sue you if you do more stuff like James O'Keefe did.
[01:39:06.334 --> 01:39:10.295]  Yeah, I mean, I think investigative journalism itself is on the line.
[01:39:10.295 --> 01:39:18.038]  I mean, a lot of media companies don't have the brass balls it takes to go out and speak truth to power.
[01:39:18.038 --> 01:39:30.663]  I said on your show before that a lot of these journalists, a lot of these media organizations can't do the job because they're worried about the government regulators coming after them, let's say if Hillary was elected.
[01:39:30.663 --> 01:39:34.264]  And we went out on a limb and did it, and they're trying to deter
[01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:38.332]  Us and establishment news organizations.
[01:39:38.332 --> 01:39:42.975]  I'm speaking truth to power against the establishment because this is what happens to you when you do so.
[01:39:42.975 --> 01:39:44.557]  You get sued for a million dollars.
[01:39:44.557 --> 01:39:46.258]  This is a press stunt.
[01:39:46.258 --> 01:39:47.619]  Kramer is pulling a million dollars.
[01:39:47.619 --> 01:39:49.521]  What does that even mean, a million dollars?
[01:39:49.521 --> 01:39:50.341]  And we're on the right.
[01:39:50.341 --> 01:39:51.342]  I'm not worried about it.
[01:39:51.342 --> 01:39:58.508]  I mean, the legal issues are kind of complex, but he's trying to say that I breached fiduciary duty by having my journalist
[01:39:59.308 --> 01:40:00.349]  Film him.
[01:40:00.349 --> 01:40:03.450]  Well, the journalist's duty is to Veritas, not to Bob Kramer.
[01:40:03.450 --> 01:40:07.773]  And the stuff these people were saying in the Cape is just... I mean, I'm happy to revisit it.
[01:40:07.773 --> 01:40:16.858]  He's talking about... It was Hillary's idea to put ducks on the ground, code word for get punched in the face and incite violence at Trump rallies.
[01:40:16.858 --> 01:40:22.881]  He was saying that he knows other people who can illegally register voters and send them across state lines using fake IDs and shell companies.
[01:40:22.881 --> 01:40:25.862]  It's the type of stuff this guy was caught on Cape's phone.
[01:40:25.862 --> 01:40:26.683]  And by the way, Alex,
[01:40:27.183 --> 01:40:30.426]  We live in a media environment where people can use anonymous sources.
[01:40:30.426 --> 01:40:35.671]  Every single claim that we make is buttressed by videotape of them saying what they said.
[01:40:35.671 --> 01:40:37.933]  And yet, you're not supposed to believe us.
[01:40:37.933 --> 01:40:42.277]  You're supposed to believe all these journalists who use anonymous sources quoting hearsay from other anonymous sources.
[01:40:42.717 --> 01:40:46.680]  So I believe that this lawsuit is an attempt to silence me.
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:51.843]  The statement I put out yesterday was that over my dead body would I ever be silenced.
[01:40:51.843 --> 01:40:54.985]  The next main target of Veritas is the media.
[01:40:54.985 --> 01:40:58.588]  We will be releasing some big stories against these media companies.
[01:40:58.588 --> 01:41:02.851]  And frankly, I'm not too worried about the lawsuit, but I think it's going to be a fight.
[01:41:04.113 --> 01:41:06.774]  Exactly, and you know, my next target is the media.
[01:41:06.774 --> 01:41:15.357]  That's why we're doing a contest, you know, basically pointing out that CNN promotes terrorist memes, but so does other mainstream media saying kill Trump, murder Trump.
[01:41:15.357 --> 01:41:21.820]  And so we're going to expand it just to say, you know, you'll basically wear t-shirts or have signs saying CNN is fake media, MSNBC is fake media.
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:22.240]  It doesn't matter.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:25.381]  As long as it's mainstream media, people are exposing, they can be part of that contest.
[01:41:25.381 --> 01:41:26.782]  But expanding on this,
[01:41:28.410 --> 01:41:44.302]  I'm not going to get into the settlement with Shabani because I did an agreement with them and I'm not going to get into other things that have happened, but when we cover somebody else's report that isn't 100% accurate, I come out before they even criticize us and say we were wrong about this.
[01:41:44.302 --> 01:41:47.444]  Then that's taken as weakness.
[01:41:47.444 --> 01:41:50.046]  We get sued.
[01:41:50.046 --> 01:41:54.390]  They use our correction as the excuse that we admit we were slightly wrong about something.
[01:41:55.523 --> 01:42:09.430]  Then I realized, these people are doing these lawsuits for publicity stunts to simply put Infowars.com or Veritas Project on the news as if we're these horrible demons that are being shot down or being destroyed.
[01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:10.410]  So this is their tactic.
[01:42:10.410 --> 01:42:19.774]  So then I realized, I guess in the future I can't settle suits, even if I then later realize that I'm not paying anything out.
[01:42:19.774 --> 01:42:20.775]  In fact, it's the other way around.
[01:42:22.250 --> 01:42:24.731]  You're like, oh my god, they didn't care about that.
[01:42:24.731 --> 01:42:26.312]  They just wanted me to say I was wrong.
[01:42:26.312 --> 01:42:28.152]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:42:28.152 --> 01:42:32.174]  No, the same thing happened with us in the Acorn story that we did, you know, eight years ago.
[01:42:32.174 --> 01:42:37.636]  We got sued by Acorn and it would have cost me a million dollars to fight this lawsuit.
[01:42:37.636 --> 01:42:41.158]  It was not over whether or not the tapes were true.
[01:42:41.158 --> 01:42:43.299]  Everything we report was true.
[01:42:43.299 --> 01:42:45.900]  It was over whether I had his permission to film him.
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:54.103]  But the fact that they sued me and I settled the lawsuit, and then now Wikipedia entry says, oh, he'll keep us guilty, he settled the lawsuit.
[01:42:54.103 --> 01:43:02.227]  Well, I settled the lawsuit because I don't have the funds to spend a million dollars on fighting this permission to record government workers.
[01:43:02.227 --> 01:43:05.128]  I think all government workers should be recorded during their duties.
[01:43:05.128 --> 01:43:09.370]  I don't think we should have to have permission if they're taxpayer-funded and it's a public place.
[01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:12.313]  But this is the tactic they use, and it's so important.
[01:43:12.313 --> 01:43:20.143]  I told my team yesterday, Alex, I said, for every defensive thing that we say and do, one statement or activity on offense.
[01:43:20.143 --> 01:43:22.186]  We can't let these people manipulate the narrative.
[01:43:22.702 --> 01:43:32.128]  And I know it's going to be a fight, and I believe, I bet you that they're going to invoke the Fifth Amendment right to self-incrimination if they do get deposed.
[01:43:32.128 --> 01:43:40.614]  I would love it if Bob Kramer and Scott Vogel got deposed, because the stuff they're saying in these states... The Attorney General of Wisconsin right now is a criminal investigation into Scott Vogel.
[01:43:40.614 --> 01:43:42.055]  That's ongoing.
[01:43:42.055 --> 01:43:43.896]  So, he might get arrested.
[01:43:44.483 --> 01:43:47.184]  But we've got to double down, we've got to fight back.
[01:43:47.184 --> 01:43:49.165]  Investigative journalism is on the line.
[01:43:49.165 --> 01:43:57.929]  What they did is David Delight, my colleague and friend, they stormed into his house in California with AR-15s, the Kelmala Harris, the state government in California.
[01:43:57.929 --> 01:44:02.711]  They confiscated his hard drives because they didn't like he was investigating Planned Parenthood.
[01:44:02.711 --> 01:44:12.336]  I mean, we were living in unbelievable times, and every one of us has to fight back, not be silenced, not be shut down by these frivolous lawsuits.
[01:44:12.336 --> 01:44:13.136]  And that's my intention.
[01:44:15.191 --> 01:44:15.971]  I think you're right.
[01:44:15.971 --> 01:44:19.852]  Expand on some of the things that Bob Kramer has said on video.
[01:44:19.852 --> 01:44:42.977]  Well, Bob Kramer was, the main thing he said which was most devastating and the reason why Hillary fired him is because he said that it was Hillary's idea to put ducks on the ground, that it was in fact her idea to put these people at Trump events in Chicago and elsewhere, get punched in the face, invoke violence, was all her idea.
[01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:51.114]  And then he sets us up with this guy, Scott Foval, who tells us how to bust people across state lines.
[01:44:51.114 --> 01:45:00.919]  And Scott Foval says that it was the Hillary Clinton campaign paying this other group, paying this other group, which paid democracy partners and got people on the ground.
[01:45:00.919 --> 01:45:03.061]  He was talking about an illegal transfer of money.
[01:45:03.061 --> 01:45:04.522]  Scott Foval was fired.
[01:45:04.522 --> 01:45:06.783]  Bob Cramer was let go.
[01:45:06.783 --> 01:45:10.405]  Bob Cramer is a particularly soulless, immoral character.
[01:45:10.405 --> 01:45:13.327]  He's married to Congresswoman Jan Jankowski out of Illinois.
[01:45:14.033 --> 01:45:20.655]  And it was devastating, and I think he's going to spend the rest of his natural life trying to bring me down or make my life a living hell.
[01:45:20.655 --> 01:45:22.096]  He's very close to Barack Obama.
[01:45:22.096 --> 01:45:24.337]  He's visited the White House some 47 times.
[01:45:24.337 --> 01:45:30.619]  And Alex, in this lawsuit, he falsely accuses me of entering the White House using false pretenses.
[01:45:30.619 --> 01:45:35.820]  In fact, Bob Kramer did invite my undercover reporter to the White House, but we couldn't go.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:36.801]  Imagine that!
[01:45:36.801 --> 01:45:39.902]  He invited my undercover reporter to meet with the President.
[01:45:40.845 --> 01:45:42.987]  And I couldn't go because I don't want to break the law.
[01:45:42.987 --> 01:45:44.928]  I can't go into the White House using a fake ID.
[01:45:44.928 --> 01:45:45.409]  I remember!
[01:45:45.409 --> 01:45:46.430]  You said it at the time!
[01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:48.231]  You said it at the time!
[01:45:48.231 --> 01:45:52.394]  Yeah, but the point is, is this guy is close with Barack Obama.
[01:45:52.394 --> 01:45:58.600]  He is, in fact, he was sitting in the front row of a speech that Barack Obama gave shortly after the election.
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.281]  And he invited us to go meet with him.
[01:46:00.281 --> 01:46:03.904]  And he's talking about all this illegal stuff that they're doing.
[01:46:04.597 --> 01:46:07.018]  And the media doesn't care.
[01:46:07.018 --> 01:46:10.460]  The media doesn't trust us.
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:12.221]  I buttress all my claims with videotape.
[01:46:12.221 --> 01:46:14.122]  They make up stuff with anonymous sources.
[01:46:14.122 --> 01:46:23.467]  I think we need to start saying to the media, unless you actually show us tape or your notebooks of what these sources are saying, we don't believe you because you have no credibility.
[01:46:23.467 --> 01:46:27.609]  Every prediction, everything you said during the election was proved to be wrong.
[01:46:27.609 --> 01:46:29.310]  But this is the game we play.
[01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:32.172]  Andrew Breitbart always told me we have to be held to a higher standard.
[01:46:32.592 --> 01:46:38.703]  But in any event, that's what Kramer did, that's what we're facing, and we're gonna fight it.
[01:46:38.703 --> 01:46:40.526]  Did he try to settle something before he sued you?
[01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:47.701]  Well, he's been going after me, Alex.
[01:46:47.701 --> 01:46:50.883]  I gave a speech in New York, and he sent one of his minions there.
[01:46:50.883 --> 01:46:52.583]  The guy threw himself down the stairs.
[01:46:52.583 --> 01:46:53.824]  His name is Ryan Clayton.
[01:46:53.824 --> 01:46:56.945]  He called the NYPD, and he said, James O'Keefe assaulted me.
[01:46:56.945 --> 01:46:58.285]  James O'Keefe assaulted me.
[01:46:58.285 --> 01:47:02.227]  So they do this thing called bird-dogging, where they do this Agitprop stuff.
[01:47:02.227 --> 01:47:04.728]  Now, the difference between what I do and what he does is he makes stuff up.
[01:47:04.728 --> 01:47:07.308]  He just manufactures crap.
[01:47:07.308 --> 01:47:11.290]  He puts Russian flags in people's hands and teapags and says, look, everyone likes Russia.
[01:47:12.354 --> 01:47:20.642]  It's a kind of immoral depravity with no ethics and no integrity where they just literally incite violence at events.
[01:47:20.642 --> 01:47:22.724]  So he's been coming after me that way.
[01:47:22.724 --> 01:47:24.546]  I'm not afraid of it.
[01:47:24.546 --> 01:47:26.568]  Please don't mistake this as me complaining.
[01:47:26.568 --> 01:47:28.450]  I welcome the challenge.
[01:47:28.450 --> 01:47:29.511]  I think it's a sign of respect.
[01:47:29.511 --> 01:47:35.917]  But the battles joined and folks need to know that you are on the battlefield and you are in toe-to-toe combat with the slimeballs.
[01:47:36.857 --> 01:47:40.218]  Yes, and I think people need to realize that people are very afraid, Alex.
[01:47:40.218 --> 01:47:42.960]  I mean, people, this is a deterrent.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:46.581]  People will not air these stories because they are afraid.
[01:47:46.581 --> 01:47:51.103]  These stories were spiked by the mainstream media, including Fox News.
[01:47:51.103 --> 01:47:55.585]  They did not want to air them because they did not want to deal with the liability.
[01:47:55.585 --> 01:47:57.806]  The good news is, Infowars and Drudge did.
[01:47:59.025 --> 01:48:00.227]  Yeah, you guys did.
[01:48:00.227 --> 01:48:01.450]  You guys absolutely did.
[01:48:01.450 --> 01:48:05.257]  You always do, and I thank you very much for putting your neck on the line.
[01:48:05.257 --> 01:48:06.740]  No, brother, we're in this together.
[01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:09.766]  If there were more people like you, James O'Keefe, we'd be out of the woods very quickly.
[01:48:10.649 --> 01:48:12.231]  The more true it gets, the worse it gets.
[01:48:12.231 --> 01:48:13.212]  That's what you need to remember.
[01:48:13.212 --> 01:48:21.520]  The more true it gets, the more lethal, the more effective, the more you expose, the less likely that these established groups are going to air the stories.
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:23.282]  That's why you guys got to stand up.
[01:48:23.282 --> 01:48:24.603]  You guys got to tweet the stories out.
[01:48:24.603 --> 01:48:28.267]  And I promise you, we are going to have some major ones coming.
[01:48:28.267 --> 01:48:29.649]  And I can't wait to be on your show.
[01:48:29.649 --> 01:48:30.750]  All right, James O'Keefe.
[01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:31.230]  Great job.
[01:48:31.230 --> 01:48:31.671]  God bless you.
[01:48:31.671 --> 01:48:33.032]  We appreciate you, my friend.
[01:48:33.032 --> 01:48:33.653]  Thank you.
[01:48:33.653 --> 01:48:33.893]  Thank you.
[01:48:35.066 --> 01:48:36.246]  You know, it's a scary thing.
[01:48:36.246 --> 01:48:40.347]  A lot of folks in media, even in new media, think they're in competition with people.
[01:48:40.347 --> 01:48:46.908]  No, we need more James O'Keefe's, more Matt Drudge's, more Donald Trump's, more Donald Trump Jr.'
[01:48:46.888 --> 01:48:52.529]  's, because they come after you.
[01:48:52.529 --> 01:48:59.130]  But as there becomes more and more of a standing up, it becomes harder and harder for the globals to control people.
[01:48:59.130 --> 01:49:01.531]  And so that's why I'm here and why I'm fighting so hard.
[01:49:03.220 --> 01:49:08.204]  They're coming after us because we're destroying them right now.
[01:49:08.204 --> 01:49:12.147]  This is a 21st century war.
[01:49:12.147 --> 01:49:14.408]  And of course this lawsuit has no merit.
[01:49:14.408 --> 01:49:18.111]  Of course O'Keefe's going to win.
[01:49:18.111 --> 01:49:23.415]  But they want to drag him through the mud with big Democrat money, trying to destroy him on the way.
[01:49:23.415 --> 01:49:23.935]  And then what?
[01:49:23.935 --> 01:49:24.876]  Okay, they lose the suit.
[01:49:24.876 --> 01:49:27.558]  Okay, maybe he gets attorney's fees three years from now.
[01:49:28.848 --> 01:49:35.095]  But they've pulled O'Keefe, who caused them billions of dollars of financial global damage.
[01:49:35.095 --> 01:49:39.060]  By that, it cost their propaganda billions of dollars to put Hillary in.
[01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:41.603]  He just caused billions of dollars of truth to come in.
[01:49:41.603 --> 01:49:45.448]  And it's not his fault Hillary did the things she did.
[01:49:45.448 --> 01:49:47.811]  The people he videotapes said the things they said.
[01:49:49.565 --> 01:49:52.327]  And they're not suing him for taking it out of context or editing it.
[01:49:52.327 --> 01:49:56.511]  They're suing him saying, these people claim they were coming to work for us.
[01:49:56.511 --> 01:49:57.872]  They didn't get the job, did they?
[01:49:57.872 --> 01:49:58.893]  And it was in public places.
[01:49:58.893 --> 01:50:02.916]  So they're trying to sue saying, oh, well, you know, you really worked for us when you did that.
[01:50:02.916 --> 01:50:05.058]  So, you know, you're on our time now.
[01:50:05.058 --> 01:50:11.623]  So that's our proprietary knowledge that we're going to get people to vote over and over again illegally.
[01:50:11.623 --> 01:50:15.846]  Or that we're going to send folks into these rallies.
[01:50:15.846 --> 01:50:16.387]  We're going to go to break.
[01:50:17.679 --> 01:50:20.248]  Got another Trump clip coming up after this segment, but I tell ya.
[01:50:21.476 --> 01:50:22.636]  We got some other big guests as well.
[01:50:22.636 --> 01:50:25.337]  James Leslie Rawls, Mike Cernovich and others today.
[01:50:25.337 --> 01:50:27.517]  But this is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:50:27.517 --> 01:50:29.698]  It's amazing and the battle is joint.
[01:50:29.698 --> 01:50:31.358]  And folks should be more excited now than ever.
[01:50:31.358 --> 01:50:33.498]  Way before, you know, the election, I saw this coming.
[01:50:33.498 --> 01:50:35.799]  But during the election, I couldn't believe it was actually happening.
[01:50:35.799 --> 01:50:38.499]  Now, history is just unfolding before us.
[01:50:38.499 --> 01:50:41.480]  We have the Memorial Day specials that are now the start of summer specials.
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:43.580]  I'm extending into early next week, into Monday.
[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:47.401]  Then they will have to end because we're selling out of some products.
[01:50:47.401 --> 01:50:49.422]  65% off on our great colloidal silver, Silver Bullet.
[01:50:49.422 --> 01:50:51.202]  30% off Super Metal Vitality.

[01:51:01.164 --> 01:51:05.945]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:51:05.945 --> 01:51:11.827]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:51:11.827 --> 01:51:18.328]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.

[01:51:32.772 --> 01:51:35.013]  Then you need to have your own energy source.

[01:52:00.626 --> 01:52:14.895]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[01:52:14.895 --> 01:52:19.618]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about, is those that made the ultimate sacrifice.
[01:52:19.878 --> 01:52:33.951]  For the belief they were building a better world, this group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest you've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.
[01:52:33.951 --> 01:52:38.776]  We have over a thousand high-quality products available that are discounted at Inforrestore.com.

[01:53:00.484 --> 01:53:04.527]  Nearly one third of FBI domestic terrorism cases involve refugees.
[01:53:04.527 --> 01:53:05.608]  One third.
[01:53:05.608 --> 01:53:07.609]  There's already been riots across Europe.
[01:53:07.609 --> 01:53:08.830]  Is America next?
[01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:11.111]  Hi, I'm the owner of Infidel Body Armor.
[01:53:11.111 --> 01:53:16.315]  Over the past four years, I've sold thousands of body armor kits and trained hundreds of sheepdogs.
[01:53:16.315 --> 01:53:17.636]  They have prepared.
[01:53:17.636 --> 01:53:18.637]  Have you?
[01:53:18.637 --> 01:53:23.320]  I invite you to go to my website at InfidelBodyArmor.com and click on Specials.
[01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:24.481]  Trouble is coming.
[01:53:24.481 --> 01:53:25.982]  Now do something about it.
[01:53:25.982 --> 01:53:29.044]  InfidelBodyArmor.com just won't quit.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:30.881]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:53:30.881 --> 01:53:33.262]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:53:33.262 --> 01:53:41.308]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:53:41.308 --> 01:53:43.230]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:53:43.230 --> 01:53:46.893]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:53:46.893 --> 01:53:51.556]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[01:53:51.556 --> 01:53:55.959]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[01:53:55.959 --> 01:53:56.600]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:54:17.077 --> 01:54:19.398]  Oh yeah, strange days have definitely found us.
[01:54:19.398 --> 01:54:23.360]  Stuff I was doing during the little three minute break is just insane.
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:27.362]  What else can I tell you about that?
[01:54:27.362 --> 01:54:28.062]  Here's what's happening.
[01:54:28.062 --> 01:54:44.149]  The globalists thought they could bring in a whole world government and just always have the media say it doesn't exist and that somehow they'd found a global government with global taxes, a global army, global courts that's all unelected and absolutely authoritarian and somehow that would fly.
[01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.669]  That's what they think.
[01:54:46.431 --> 01:54:54.174]  And then you've got Kathy Griffin and all these people running around in the news pushing violence.
[01:54:54.174 --> 01:54:56.694]  And then Griffin comes out with her lawyer and says, I'm not sorry.
[01:54:56.694 --> 01:55:00.556]  Trump's talked bad about women before, so I'm going to double down on what I'm doing.
[01:55:00.556 --> 01:55:02.996]  First she says she's sorry, then she says she isn't.
[01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:06.838]  I said she's not even the bad one.
[01:55:06.838 --> 01:55:07.498]  Compared to
[01:55:09.076 --> 01:55:11.098]  She looks too much like my dad's mom, too.
[01:55:11.098 --> 01:55:13.479]  It's a little scary.
[01:55:13.479 --> 01:55:15.221]  It looks like her when she was about 45.
[01:55:15.221 --> 01:55:16.101]  That's crazy.
[01:55:16.101 --> 01:55:18.043]  That looks like Patty Jones right there.
[01:55:18.043 --> 01:55:21.445]  But I'm sitting there, you know, watching this unfold.
[01:55:21.445 --> 01:55:26.829]  What about the MSNBC analysts saying ISIS needs to blow up Trump Tower?
[01:55:26.829 --> 01:55:28.671]  Or people saying, let's kill Trump.
[01:55:28.671 --> 01:55:30.272]  Showing a severed head is bad enough.
[01:55:31.363 --> 01:55:36.866]  And the ode to ISIS, and I say it's uncouth and I don't like it, but what about how far the others go?
[01:55:36.866 --> 01:55:40.347]  That's why we have the contest going at Infowars.com forward slash contest.
[01:55:40.347 --> 01:55:43.209]  It can be CNN's fake news, MSNBC's fake news.
[01:55:43.209 --> 01:55:47.271]  I'm going to expand it, bigger than just Kathy Griffin.
[01:55:47.271 --> 01:55:53.254]  So basically anything you do spectacular to expose the New World Order as the enemy is legal and lawful.
[01:55:53.254 --> 01:55:58.216]  20,000, 200,000 cash prizes, Infowars launching operation, expose terrorist media, Kathy Griffin.
[01:55:59.724 --> 01:56:02.145]  I'm going to do forward slash fake media.
[01:56:02.145 --> 01:56:06.407]  It's letting the public know we're aware of you, we're crashing your media, we're getting in your face.
[01:56:06.407 --> 01:56:07.847]  And you know what?
[01:56:07.847 --> 01:56:14.830]  If you get Hillary Clinton's a war criminal, supported ISIS in, InfoWars.com, you're in the running too.
[01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:21.052]  It's kind of just a smorgasbord, wide open, I want to pay out, I want to do it, please take action.
[01:56:21.052 --> 01:56:25.194]  Last time it took about five days until it started when I launched the contest, Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[01:56:25.834 --> 01:56:27.337]  Send us your videos at contests.
[01:56:27.337 --> 01:56:28.820]  Get them out there.
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:32.426]  The big thing is just the entertainment of seeing the MSM burn down.
[01:56:32.426 --> 01:56:37.155]  Here's a quick clip of Mrs. Griffin at her press conference today, her PR stunt.
[01:56:38.590 --> 01:56:40.951]  Yeah, you said you've been bullied by the Trump family.
[01:56:40.951 --> 01:56:43.232]  Have they reached out to you outside of social media?
[01:56:43.232 --> 01:56:44.353]  I don't think they have to.
[01:56:44.353 --> 01:56:49.376]  My impression is that they have mobilized their armies or their bots or whatever they do.
[01:56:49.376 --> 01:56:54.018]  Like I said, it's quite clear to me that they're trying to use me as a distraction.
[01:56:54.018 --> 01:56:57.199]  And I'm not going to do collateral damage for this fool.
[01:56:57.199 --> 01:56:58.480]  I think he's a fool.
[01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:00.401]  So I'm going to say I think the president is a fool.
[01:57:02.242 --> 01:57:02.982]  You know, I can say that.
[01:57:02.982 --> 01:57:06.083]  Do you have fear for your career after this storm dies down?
[01:57:06.083 --> 01:57:06.743]  Absolutely.
[01:57:06.743 --> 01:57:08.844]  I don't think I will have a career after this.
[01:57:08.844 --> 01:57:10.825]  I think he... Okay, but you didn't have a career.
[01:57:10.825 --> 01:57:12.305]  I think he... It was a stunt!
[01:57:12.305 --> 01:57:12.945]  I'm gonna be honest.
[01:57:12.945 --> 01:57:14.306]  He broke me.
[01:57:14.306 --> 01:57:17.367]  He broke me.
[01:57:17.367 --> 01:57:17.667]  He broke...
[01:57:19.028 --> 01:57:21.890]  And then I was like, no, this isn't right.
[01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:23.171]  I just wanted him dead.
[01:57:23.171 --> 01:57:25.073]  I apologize.
[01:57:25.073 --> 01:57:27.635]  I'm a bad actress.
[01:57:27.635 --> 01:57:29.676]  I saw the tide turning and I saw what they were doing.
[01:57:29.676 --> 01:57:31.678]  And I went, oh, OK, they're trying to spin this.
[01:57:31.678 --> 01:57:33.059]  So they're making about Karen.
[01:57:33.059 --> 01:57:35.201]  And obviously, that was never my intent.
[01:57:35.201 --> 01:57:36.322]  I would never want to hurt anyone.
[01:57:36.322 --> 01:57:36.862]  She's so fake.
[01:57:36.862 --> 01:57:37.883]  She's a bad actress.
[01:57:37.883 --> 01:57:41.005]  When I say she wasn't my grandmother, that earlier photo where she looked better, she did.
[01:57:41.005 --> 01:57:44.348]  I mean, the same red hair, same white skin, same bone structure.
[01:57:44.348 --> 01:57:46.830]  My grandmother was not like this lady, though.
[01:57:48.916 --> 01:57:55.258]  This is so fake.
[01:57:55.258 --> 01:57:58.119]  I mean, this is the worst acting I've ever seen.
[01:57:58.119 --> 01:57:59.460]  Purple me.
[01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:00.420]  Purple me.
[01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:04.881]  I just did an ISIS reenactment of chopping the president's head off and it looked real.
[01:58:04.881 --> 01:58:07.902]  You know, the media's all calling for killing him and I'm a victim.
[01:58:07.902 --> 01:58:09.383]  The public doesn't like it.
[01:58:09.383 --> 01:58:10.623]  They say kill the president.
[01:58:18.166 --> 01:58:19.309]  We're going to break.
[01:58:19.309 --> 01:58:21.275]  We've got the Memorial Day specials extended.
[01:58:21.275 --> 01:58:23.021]  I need your support today!
[01:58:24.076 --> 01:58:27.859]  We have got Emerson Essentials 25% off when you sign up for AutoShop.

[01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:45.191]  I salute you!

[01:58:46.892 --> 01:58:47.793]  Hour number three straight ahead.
[01:58:51.266 --> 01:59:05.602]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord, right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[01:59:05.602 --> 01:59:07.925]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[01:59:08.425 --> 01:59:12.387]  is those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[01:59:12.387 --> 01:59:24.733]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.
[01:59:24.733 --> 01:59:29.575]  We have over a thousand high-quality products available that are discounted at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:29.755 --> 01:59:31.435]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:11.244 --> 02:00:15.286]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:15.286 --> 02:00:17.086]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:42.346 --> 02:00:45.249]  She's a joke!
[02:00:45.249 --> 02:00:46.611]  And so now you see the PR stunt.
[02:00:46.611 --> 02:00:49.174]  Join the rest of the media implying Trump should be killed.
[02:00:49.174 --> 02:00:51.176]  Other media just says kill him outright.
[02:00:51.176 --> 02:00:56.162]  CNBC host, MSNBC host, you know, say, just, ISIS, please bomb his hotels.
[02:00:56.162 --> 02:00:58.865]  Please bomb his facilities.
[02:00:58.865 --> 02:01:02.610]  And then Cathy Griffin's response is now fake crying.
[02:01:04.713 --> 02:01:07.355]  At a level I've never seen before saying I'm a woman.
[02:01:07.355 --> 02:01:10.476]  Obviously he's attacking me because I'm a woman.
[02:01:10.476 --> 02:01:16.460]  No, it's because there's an image of you chopping his head off and all he said is you should be ashamed of yourself.
[02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:17.681]  Here, let's just play more of the clip.
[02:01:17.681 --> 02:01:18.241]  This is crazy.
[02:01:19.853 --> 02:01:21.074]  No, cut the crap.
[02:01:21.074 --> 02:01:22.395]  This wouldn't be happening to a guy.
[02:01:22.395 --> 02:01:23.636]  This is a woman thing, alright?
[02:01:23.636 --> 02:01:24.917]  I'm just gonna come out and say it.
[02:01:24.917 --> 02:01:27.419]  And I'm sorry if you don't agree with me, but I live it.
[02:01:27.419 --> 02:01:29.340]  I'm 56 years old.
[02:01:29.340 --> 02:01:32.722]  Everywhere I play, there's a male promoter, there's a male who owns the theater.
[02:01:32.722 --> 02:01:34.584]  The people who sign my checks are white guys.
[02:01:34.584 --> 02:01:38.026]  They're usually... The white guys?
[02:01:38.026 --> 02:01:40.468]  I mean, this just gets crazier and crazier.
[02:01:40.468 --> 02:01:44.211]  Go to North Korea, there won't be any club owners that are white.
[02:01:44.211 --> 02:01:47.313]  Go to Venezuela, where the buildings are burning down, everybody's murdering each other's streets.
[02:01:47.313 --> 02:01:48.614]  There won't be any of those evil white guys.
[02:01:51.311 --> 02:02:09.056]  White people used to live just like that, then we had a renaissance and built some technology and we're not perfect, but I mean, you can be pretty stable in Europe and the United States, we've got our problems, but now, white guys, the people that own the clubs are white!
[02:02:09.056 --> 02:02:16.918]  You know how many black-owned and Hispanic-owned bars and restaurants there are and comedy clubs?
[02:02:16.918 --> 02:02:19.919]  And I'm, they got good food and good comedy, I'm going there.
[02:02:21.015 --> 02:02:37.804]  But I mean, the claim that there aren't black-owned or Hispanic-owned... A lot of Asian-owned restaurants, I know, too, but I mean, the point is, it's just, you go to these comedy clubs... A lot of the time, a white dude doesn't own it, or four or five people own it, I mean, this is just crazy!
[02:02:37.804 --> 02:02:42.966]  And so, a white dude's bad that he goes and builds a comedy club, and then he books you?
[02:02:42.966 --> 02:02:45.568]  You don't know what it's like, the white males!
[02:02:45.568 --> 02:02:48.890]  They just... They sign the checks!
[02:02:49.895 --> 02:02:53.398]  The abuse of the check!
[02:02:53.398 --> 02:02:55.319]  They're the ones to the check!
[02:02:55.319 --> 02:02:58.842]  Go start a comedy club, sweetheart.
[02:02:58.842 --> 02:03:00.363]  Go get the bank loan.
[02:03:00.363 --> 02:03:01.744]  Get the location.
[02:03:01.744 --> 02:03:03.025]  Do the advertising.
[02:03:03.025 --> 02:03:04.366]  Book the people.
[02:03:04.366 --> 02:03:05.186]  Make the money.
[02:03:05.186 --> 02:03:08.849]  I mean, you know how many women are involved in record companies at the highest levels?
[02:03:08.849 --> 02:03:12.071]  How many women are producers in big movies?
[02:03:12.071 --> 02:03:14.833]  You know how many women?
[02:03:14.833 --> 02:03:17.756]  Here's my experience with women, though, on average, and this is with The Statistic Show.
[02:03:18.573 --> 02:03:28.076]  They end up wanting to have a baby, or they end up wanting, after they make $50 million, they want to go, they want to stop.
[02:03:28.076 --> 02:03:30.856]  And for whatever reason, men tend to not stop.
[02:03:30.856 --> 02:03:35.317]  And believe me, men stop plenty too, all the time.
[02:03:35.317 --> 02:03:37.318]  People get out of the kitchen, man, it's too hot.
[02:03:37.318 --> 02:03:39.519]  They can't handle it.
[02:03:39.519 --> 02:03:44.600]  Or you, you know, you don't want to get out of the kitchen, but you start having a heart problem, or you know, you know, you get cancer, that'll get you out of the kitchen.
[02:03:45.828 --> 02:03:50.590]  But men kill themselves to build things for their women and their children.
[02:03:50.590 --> 02:03:52.990]  It doesn't mean women can't build things or children can't.
[02:03:52.990 --> 02:03:55.151]  Men, though, go out and fight wars and die.
[02:03:55.151 --> 02:03:56.111]  You're men.
[02:03:56.111 --> 02:03:57.572]  You're going to go on ships and go around the world.
[02:03:57.572 --> 02:03:58.492]  You'll probably die.
[02:03:58.492 --> 02:03:58.952]  We're men.
[02:03:58.952 --> 02:03:59.132]  Good.
[02:03:59.132 --> 02:04:00.793]  We'll do it.
[02:04:00.793 --> 02:04:02.013]  That's what men do.
[02:04:02.013 --> 02:04:09.696]  Instead of celebrating that men are like these worker bee warrior ants that go out and build civilization,
[02:04:10.802 --> 02:04:18.505]  And women are supposed to then try to have it all cultured and beautiful and put their panache on it.
[02:04:18.505 --> 02:04:24.267]  Women have decided, we want to wait out, we want to be in frontline combat.
[02:04:24.267 --> 02:04:26.767]  Okay, well the average woman can't carry an 80-pound pack.
[02:04:26.767 --> 02:04:29.508]  The average man can't, but even less women.
[02:04:29.508 --> 02:04:32.890]  So they're lowering the pack to 35 pounds.
[02:04:32.890 --> 02:04:34.270]  And then, oh, women mean more time.
[02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:36.511]  Oh, women have a higher instance of infection.
[02:04:38.041 --> 02:04:45.146]  Oh, you mean you don't want to do that great thing of being in a foxhole for a month, crapping in your helmet?
[02:04:45.146 --> 02:04:46.967]  But it's just all beyond that.
[02:04:46.967 --> 02:04:51.771]  I mean, this is the most pathetic, insane, left-committing suicide I've ever seen.
[02:04:51.771 --> 02:04:53.632]  Kathy Griffin's press conference.
[02:04:53.632 --> 02:04:55.313]  We've got to play more of this coming up.
[02:04:55.313 --> 02:04:57.635]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[02:05:01.431 --> 02:05:06.173]  Bilderberg 2017 is kicking off in Chantilly, Virginia this year.
[02:05:06.173 --> 02:05:15.698]  This is the first Bilderberg meeting since the populist uprisings of Brexit and the Trump election have come to pass, and the elites now see their power base crumbling before their very eyes.
[02:05:15.698 --> 02:05:21.261]  Among some of the subjects of the secret confab will be the Trump administration, and can he be healed?
[02:05:21.261 --> 02:05:23.282]  Also the rise of populism.
[02:05:23.282 --> 02:05:25.303]  Elites are beginning to fear that their power base
[02:05:25.603 --> 02:05:26.524]  May be crumbling.
[02:05:26.524 --> 02:05:30.307]  Now, three members of the current Trump administration are going to be attending.
[02:05:30.307 --> 02:05:33.429]  HR McMaster, Wilbur Ross, and Chris Liddell.
[02:05:33.429 --> 02:05:39.334]  Most Trump insiders believe that these three are there to help the elites derail the current administration.
[02:05:39.334 --> 02:05:40.875]  There are two ways in which this can go.
[02:05:40.875 --> 02:05:43.017]  Either the globals will try to bring Trump to heel,
[02:05:43.237 --> 02:05:45.999]  Or they will try to impeach him after the 2018 election.
[02:05:45.999 --> 02:05:51.103]  You can read more about this and exclusive Bilderberg schemes to overthrow Trump on InfoWars.com.
[02:05:51.103 --> 02:05:54.345]  And ask yourself, what are you doing to wake up minds?
[02:05:54.345 --> 02:05:56.647]  Spread this link and help wake up some minds.
[02:05:56.647 --> 02:05:59.929]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:06:01.150 --> 02:06:06.615]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:06:06.615 --> 02:06:08.716]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:06:08.716 --> 02:06:14.001]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:06:14.001 --> 02:06:17.764]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[02:06:17.864 --> 02:06:21.285]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:06:21.285 --> 02:06:24.466]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:06:24.466 --> 02:06:28.347]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:06:28.347 --> 02:06:35.508]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:06:35.508 --> 02:06:41.590]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:47.917]  Nanosilver and more due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[02:06:47.917 --> 02:06:51.521]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue that is Spearmint free.
[02:06:51.521 --> 02:06:59.831]  Learn more about the new bubblegum flavor Super Blue toothpaste and more at Infowarslife.com and support the Info War while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[02:07:02.042 --> 02:07:07.524]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[02:07:07.524 --> 02:07:08.384]  I take this.
[02:07:08.384 --> 02:07:09.504]  My family takes this.
[02:07:09.504 --> 02:07:13.786]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:07:13.786 --> 02:07:18.027]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:07:18.387 --> 02:07:23.030]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:24.171]  I don't feel good.
[02:07:24.171 --> 02:07:27.914]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:07:27.914 --> 02:07:30.616]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:07:30.616 --> 02:07:36.420]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:07:36.420 --> 02:07:39.382]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:07:39.382 --> 02:07:42.904]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:07:42.904 --> 02:07:45.146]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:07:45.146 --> 02:07:45.506]  I love it.
[02:07:45.646 --> 02:07:48.448]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:07:48.448 --> 02:07:49.468]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:07:49.468 --> 02:07:55.111]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:07:55.111 --> 02:07:57.313]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:07:57.313 --> 02:08:04.797]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[02:08:04.797 --> 02:08:10.961]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:14.306 --> 02:08:23.656]  I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests.
[02:08:23.656 --> 02:08:28.340]  Many trade deals will soon be under renegotiation.
[02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:31.864]  Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country.
[02:08:31.864 --> 02:08:34.467]  But they'll soon be under renegotiation.
[02:08:34.467 --> 02:08:36.589]  The process has begun from day one.
[02:08:39.073 --> 02:08:41.174]  But now we're down to business.
[02:08:41.174 --> 02:08:56.401]  Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund.
[02:08:56.401 --> 02:08:58.402]  Nice name.
[02:08:58.402 --> 02:09:07.726]  Which calls for developed countries to send $100 billion to developing countries, all on top
[02:09:09.269 --> 02:09:12.971]  Of America's existing and massive foreign aid payments.
[02:09:12.971 --> 02:09:19.114]  So we're going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars.
[02:09:19.114 --> 02:09:21.835]  And we're already way ahead of anybody else.
[02:09:21.835 --> 02:09:26.658]  Many of the other countries haven't spent anything.
[02:09:26.658 --> 02:09:31.500]  And many of them will never pay one dime.
[02:09:31.500 --> 02:09:35.622]  The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:49.972]  Potentially tens of billions of dollars, of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion.
[02:09:49.972 --> 02:09:51.893]  Nobody else is even close.
[02:09:51.893 --> 02:09:56.618]  Most of them haven't even paid anything.
[02:09:56.618 --> 02:10:02.303]  Including funds raided out of America's budget.
[02:10:04.090 --> 02:10:08.574]  For the war against terrorism, that's where they came.
[02:10:08.574 --> 02:10:12.817]  Believe me, they didn't come from me.
[02:10:12.817 --> 02:10:15.179]  They came just before I came into office.
[02:10:15.179 --> 02:10:16.981]  Not good.
[02:10:16.981 --> 02:10:20.043]  And not good the way they took the money.
[02:10:20.043 --> 02:10:25.508]  In 2015, the United Nations, departing top
[02:10:26.616 --> 02:10:42.589]  Climate officials reportedly described the $100 billion per year as peanuts and stated that the $100 billion is the tail that wags the dog.
[02:10:42.589 --> 02:10:52.698]  In 2015, the Green Climate Fund's executive director reportedly stated that estimated funding needed would increase to $450 billion per year
[02:10:56.227 --> 02:10:59.948]  After 2020, and nobody even knows where the money is going to.
[02:10:59.948 --> 02:11:06.269]  Nobody's been able to say, where is it going to?
[02:11:06.269 --> 02:11:17.271]  Of course, the world's top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminate.
[02:11:17.271 --> 02:11:21.472]  America is $20 trillion in debt.
[02:11:21.472 --> 02:11:24.793]  Cash-strapped cities cannot hire enough police officers.
[02:11:26.354 --> 02:11:29.375]  Or fix vital infrastructure.
[02:11:29.375 --> 02:11:32.955]  Millions of our citizens are out of work.
[02:11:32.955 --> 02:11:51.759]  And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.
[02:11:51.759 --> 02:11:52.419]  So think of that.
[02:11:55.649 --> 02:11:59.372]  There are serious legal and constitutional issues as well.
[02:11:59.372 --> 02:12:00.493]  That's right.
[02:12:00.493 --> 02:12:10.661]  Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the world should not have more to say with respect to the U.S.
[02:12:10.661 --> 02:12:19.248]  economy than our own citizens and their elected representatives.
[02:12:19.248 --> 02:12:23.912]  Thus, our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion
[02:12:25.225 --> 02:12:28.786]  Of America's sovereignty.
[02:12:28.786 --> 02:12:31.026]  This is rebirth.
[02:12:31.026 --> 02:12:32.047]  This is it, folks.
[02:12:32.047 --> 02:12:39.548]  We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.
[02:12:39.548 --> 02:12:47.210]  We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they won't be.
[02:12:47.210 --> 02:12:49.031]  They won't be.
[02:12:49.031 --> 02:12:50.451]  I was elected to represent
[02:12:52.677 --> 02:12:59.659]  The citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
[02:12:59.659 --> 02:13:03.200]  Just saying that exposes the whole global system.
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:04.500]  It operates in secrecy.
[02:13:04.500 --> 02:13:06.501]  It operates in the public never hearing about it.
[02:13:06.501 --> 02:13:07.701]  Oh, Bilderberg's secret.
[02:13:07.701 --> 02:13:09.881]  Oh, TPP's being ratified in secret.
[02:13:09.881 --> 02:13:10.482]  Doesn't exist.
[02:13:10.482 --> 02:13:11.602]  Shut up, racist!
[02:13:11.602 --> 02:13:13.923]  Hey, Obamacare has death panels and doubles prices.
[02:13:13.923 --> 02:13:15.723]  Shut up, racist!
[02:13:15.723 --> 02:13:16.883]  Grubber goes on C-SPAN.
[02:13:16.883 --> 02:13:19.424]  Thank God the public's so dumb, it actually triples prices.
[02:13:21.198 --> 02:13:25.841]  See, the whole thing counts on you not being engaged.
[02:13:25.841 --> 02:13:30.323]  But the minute their program's exposed, it's over.
[02:13:30.323 --> 02:13:36.086]  And then it starts manifesting people that were patriots all along, like Trump, for 30, 40 years fighting globalism.
[02:13:36.086 --> 02:13:37.487]  His dad hated it.
[02:13:37.487 --> 02:13:38.947]  His lawyer hated it.
[02:13:38.947 --> 02:13:42.489]  James Leslie Rawls joins us, and then I'm going to open phones up towards the end of the hour.
[02:13:42.489 --> 02:13:43.970]  I've got some other clips I want to play.
[02:13:43.970 --> 02:13:45.151]  There's so much big news here.
[02:13:45.151 --> 02:13:47.152]  But Bilderberg's meeting trying to overthrow Trump.
[02:13:48.973 --> 02:13:53.974]  He's a best-selling author, top American novelist and blogger, known for being a top survivalist.
[02:13:53.974 --> 02:13:56.534]  Survivalblog.com, formerly Army Intelligence.
[02:13:56.534 --> 02:13:58.055]  Really smart analyst, great guy.
[02:13:58.055 --> 02:14:09.037]  I wanted to just get him on today, because I don't talk to him often, he's a busy guy, I'm a busy guy, just to get his analysis to make sure I'm not off the reservation here.
[02:14:09.037 --> 02:14:14.638]  But I am actually ashamed of myself that I haven't supported Trump even stronger when he goes a little bit sideways.
[02:14:14.638 --> 02:14:15.518]  What do we expect him to do?
[02:14:15.518 --> 02:14:16.898]  He's completely surrounded in a swamp.
[02:14:17.816 --> 02:14:40.082]  The killing TPP, the 49% down in illegals coming across the border, the whole government in rebellion against him, all the fake leaks, the economy surging back despite globalists wanting it to be in the tank by now, the good Supreme Court justice, the Second Amendment coming back, I mean, the carbon tax is killed.
[02:14:40.082 --> 02:14:43.023]  I mean, this is just fabulous and it's real.
[02:14:43.923 --> 02:14:48.168]  And meanwhile, they have gone into hissy fits everywhere saying, kill him, kill him now.
[02:14:48.168 --> 02:14:50.151]  My big question is, what does he think of Trump now?
[02:14:50.151 --> 02:14:51.472]  And what does he think the enemy's going to do?
[02:14:51.472 --> 02:14:57.940]  Because this has now reached... America's gaining more ground back the last 130 days, or however long Trump's been in.
[02:14:57.940 --> 02:14:58.901]  How long has it been since January 20th?
[02:14:59.972 --> 02:15:01.372]  130 days, something like that.
[02:15:01.372 --> 02:15:06.933]  In the last 130 days, we've gained back more ground for sovereignty than the last 60 years we lost.
[02:15:06.933 --> 02:15:09.034]  I mean, this is epic!
[02:15:09.034 --> 02:15:10.554]  And I know it's not just Trump.
[02:15:10.554 --> 02:15:12.994]  A lot of the intelligence agencies are patriots.
[02:15:12.994 --> 02:15:21.176]  A lot of the people in there knew finally how bad it was because Ron Paul and everybody else and Wesley Rawls and Drudge and so many others exposed it.
[02:15:21.176 --> 02:15:22.616]  We got called kooks.
[02:15:22.616 --> 02:15:24.337]  When it all came out in the open, we were right.
[02:15:24.337 --> 02:15:26.297]  People actually made the right decision and said, you know what?
[02:15:26.877 --> 02:15:27.557]  They were right!
[02:15:27.557 --> 02:15:28.398]  Screw this!
[02:15:28.398 --> 02:15:31.979]  I think we've reached that moment, but then, let's not start getting euphoric.
[02:15:31.979 --> 02:15:33.580]  False flags, I smell them.
[02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:35.941]  I mean, what are they going to do to pull their bacon out?
[02:15:35.941 --> 02:15:47.306]  Because as Soros said in the London Independent and in Der Spiegel yesterday, he said, world government's collapsing, globalism is in an existential threat, we've got to fight back.
[02:15:47.306 --> 02:15:48.906]  And their answer is, shut us down.
[02:15:48.906 --> 02:15:51.887]  It's not working though, but the point is, we're in a battle.
[02:15:51.887 --> 02:15:52.928]  James Wesley Rawls, what do you think?
[02:15:53.931 --> 02:15:54.952]  I have to agree with you.
[02:15:54.952 --> 02:16:07.283]  I think the globalists are in a downright panic right now, because for the first time in I don't know how long, we have a president who's actually keeping the promises he made on a campaign trail.
[02:16:07.283 --> 02:16:11.727]  And first and foremost of those was to reassert American sovereignty.
[02:16:11.727 --> 02:16:16.672]  And to the globalists, that's like someone approaching a vampire with
[02:16:17.242 --> 02:16:19.663]  Can you feel the energy level as well, not just intellectually?
[02:16:19.663 --> 02:16:20.664]  Can you feel it, James?
[02:16:20.664 --> 02:16:21.544]  Oh yes, absolutely.
[02:16:21.544 --> 02:16:22.625]  It's palpable that the mass media
[02:16:39.255 --> 02:16:48.537]  He is willingly and enthusiastically going after Trump because they see him as a huge threat.
[02:16:48.537 --> 02:16:52.258]  Because he stands for everything that Hillary Clinton didn't stand for.
[02:16:52.258 --> 02:16:57.359]  And just rhetorically doing it is powerful, but he's actually delivering.
[02:16:57.359 --> 02:16:58.499]  I can't believe it's this real.
[02:16:58.499 --> 02:17:00.860]  Can you?
[02:17:00.860 --> 02:17:05.101]  No, I'm very pleased to see that he's been able to implement as much of his agenda
[02:17:05.828 --> 02:17:07.410]  Yeah, well he's still...
[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:26.101]  From the executive branch, able to accomplish a lot.
[02:17:26.101 --> 02:17:28.101]  He's pushing as hard as he can.
[02:17:28.101 --> 02:17:33.382]  Unfortunately, he does not have the full cooperation of Paul Ryan and the RINOs in Congress.
[02:17:33.382 --> 02:17:35.823]  Exactly, but bottom line, I'm not just cheerleading, it's true.
[02:17:35.823 --> 02:17:39.023]  He is fighting like a mad devil, basically.
[02:17:39.023 --> 02:17:41.804]  I mean, he is throwing everything he's got against him.
[02:17:41.804 --> 02:17:45.485]  I just hope he's got the stamina, but he seems to be thriving off of it.
[02:17:45.485 --> 02:17:46.645]  Oh, he does.
[02:17:46.645 --> 02:17:50.906]  You know, he, as a former corporate executive,
[02:17:51.658 --> 02:17:57.125]  Thrives on this level of chaos, really.
[02:17:57.125 --> 02:18:01.051]  It's a very energizing battlefield that he's on.
[02:18:01.051 --> 02:18:06.298]  And I'm hopeful, in fact, I'm in prayer that he's able to keep up this pace.
[02:18:07.239 --> 02:18:09.240]  All through his first term.
[02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:09.620]  That's right.
[02:18:09.620 --> 02:18:11.861]  I know Trump, from people that know him, has always believed in God.
[02:18:11.861 --> 02:18:13.221]  He just hates fake preachers.
[02:18:13.221 --> 02:18:16.262]  But he's had a lot of new, more intense spiritual experiences now.
[02:18:16.262 --> 02:18:17.983]  And that's why he's calling on God.
[02:18:17.983 --> 02:18:19.343]  His wife's calling on God.
[02:18:19.343 --> 02:18:20.884]  Trump has really changed.
[02:18:20.884 --> 02:18:25.566]  And there's no doubt now, Trump is clearly anointed to take on the Antichrist system.
[02:18:25.566 --> 02:18:29.707]  Even if he fails down the road, I see it as a precursor to larger battles to come.
[02:18:29.707 --> 02:18:32.948]  I mean, I think we're seeing biblical prophecy right now.
[02:18:32.948 --> 02:18:34.669]  Oh, I think you're right.
[02:18:35.642 --> 02:18:39.946]  The signs that we're living in the end times are increasing every day.
[02:18:39.946 --> 02:18:49.053]  Now it was a little disappointing, speaking of end times, to see that he backpedaled a bit on his promise to relocate the U.S.
[02:18:49.053 --> 02:18:52.476]  Embassy for Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
[02:18:52.476 --> 02:18:56.199]  But the good news is he's promised to revisit that once every six months.
[02:18:57.322 --> 02:19:10.449]  And apparently, in his face-to-face meeting with Abbas, he actually shouted at Abbas, and that's the only time I've ever seen a report of Trump shouting at anyone since he's been in office.
[02:19:10.449 --> 02:19:14.711]  So, it's obvious... Well, it goes on behind the scenes privately quite a bit, but yeah.
[02:19:14.711 --> 02:19:24.336]  Yeah, it's obvious he's a friend of Israel, and I hope that he doesn't have to make too many compromises when it comes to Middle East peace.
[02:19:25.506 --> 02:19:29.569]  Well, he reportedly has pressed things to the breaking point.
[02:19:29.569 --> 02:19:30.630]  Apparently, yes.
[02:19:30.630 --> 02:19:37.556]  And again, I'm very encouraged overall with progress I've seen the Trump administration make.
[02:19:37.556 --> 02:19:45.963]  And while the mass media has been able to drum out a few folks from the Trump administration,
[02:19:47.085 --> 02:19:49.628]  The majority of them are sticking in there.
[02:19:49.628 --> 02:19:54.573]  You know, we've got Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway who are hanging in there.
[02:19:54.573 --> 02:19:55.894]  Sure, think of the pressure they're under.
[02:19:55.894 --> 02:19:58.016]  Think about my crew too, folks, and pray for them.
[02:19:58.016 --> 02:19:59.458]  Because this is not a game.
[02:20:00.911 --> 02:20:01.151]  All right.
[02:20:21.098 --> 02:20:21.659]  I think so.
[02:20:37.839 --> 02:20:40.962]  No wonder Avant has an A-plus rating from the Better Business Bureau.

[02:20:58.856 --> 02:20:59.857]  In America's 240-plus year history,
[02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:14.770]  We have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today fight their hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[02:21:14.770 --> 02:21:17.092]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[02:21:17.092 --> 02:21:21.536]  It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[02:21:21.536 --> 02:21:27.701]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because

[02:22:29.571 --> 02:22:32.433]  Many books have been written regarding the Law of Attraction.
[02:22:32.433 --> 02:22:38.916]  But what if all these books are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this law in our lives?
[02:22:38.916 --> 02:22:49.322]  The new book, It's Time to Align, the most powerful self-help book ever written by Alan Lautinger, takes a look at how the Law of Attraction really works and how it is being suppressed in our lives.

[02:22:59.713 --> 02:23:01.674]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:23:01.674 --> 02:23:06.998]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:23:06.998 --> 02:23:08.580]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:16.946]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:23:16.946 --> 02:23:22.630]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[02:24:12.677 --> 02:24:18.723]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[02:24:18.723 --> 02:24:21.866]  I won't even turn my head.
[02:24:21.866 --> 02:24:23.607]  Don't send your kinfolks.
[02:24:23.607 --> 02:24:27.731]  Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talking.
[02:24:27.731 --> 02:24:29.673]  I'll be gone, like I said.
[02:24:29.673 --> 02:24:31.775]  I'll be gone, like I said.
[02:24:31.775 --> 02:24:32.476]  Ha ha ha!
[02:24:34.033 --> 02:24:38.838]  You'd say the same old thing that you've been saying all along.
[02:24:38.838 --> 02:24:44.064]  Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[02:24:44.064 --> 02:24:49.730]  Don't give me that old familiar cryin', cussin' moan.
[02:24:55.242 --> 02:24:55.843]  Press conference.
[02:24:55.843 --> 02:24:57.225]  It was the worst acting.
[02:24:57.225 --> 02:25:05.838]  Like, if you were teaching first-year film students in college how to do fake crying, how to look disingenuous, how to look fake, it would be Kathy Griffin.
[02:25:07.821 --> 02:25:14.564]  The men signed my checks and then they just wanted to simulate killing the president and they backlashed!
[02:25:14.564 --> 02:25:15.104]  Man!
[02:25:15.104 --> 02:25:25.268]  What it's saying is I want to go around and be aggressive and attack people and then not hear Trump say, what you did is deplorable and disgusting and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[02:25:25.268 --> 02:25:27.389]  Oh my gosh, I want to be violent.
[02:25:27.389 --> 02:25:29.270]  I want to call for violence.
[02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:35.192]  I want to, you know, take the battlefield in my dress and high heels with a battle axe and just have the men stretch their necks out for us.
[02:25:37.279 --> 02:25:46.525]  She's got Gloria Allred's daughter fluttering around behind her in another publicity stunt, as if any of this does anything, getting on TV for no reason.
[02:25:46.525 --> 02:25:50.007]  I mean, this is some of the most unintentional comedy I've ever seen.
[02:25:50.007 --> 02:25:51.548]  It's coming up.
[02:25:51.548 --> 02:25:52.849]  But James Wesley Rawls...
[02:25:53.888 --> 02:25:56.969]  Getting past the Trump worship fest.
[02:25:56.969 --> 02:25:58.169]  It's not that.
[02:25:58.169 --> 02:26:00.310]  We should be happy for the success we're seeing right now.
[02:26:00.310 --> 02:26:02.770]  Survivalblog.com is your website.
[02:26:02.770 --> 02:26:06.011]  Geopolitically, though, Ron Paul was on a month ago or so.
[02:26:06.011 --> 02:26:11.013]  He said, yeah, Trump's done a great job of the economy, but it may be too little too late because it's global.
[02:26:11.013 --> 02:26:15.554]  Do you think he can head off a lot of the bad financial numbers we see globally?
[02:26:15.554 --> 02:26:17.274]  No, I don't think he can.
[02:26:17.274 --> 02:26:22.576]  And in fact, if you step back and look at this from a grand scale,
[02:26:23.439 --> 02:26:35.525]  The global economy has been in the opening stages of a multi decades long depression that started in the year 2000.
[02:26:35.525 --> 02:26:44.269]  And I think that he is not going to be able to stop those macro level economic forces.
[02:26:44.269 --> 02:26:48.711]  But certainly within the United States, he could do a lot to revitalize the economy.
[02:26:49.623 --> 02:26:54.887]  Certainly with his tax plans just by themselves, I think we'll have a chance there.
[02:26:54.887 --> 02:27:01.971]  But the level of global indebtedness that's grown up over the last 50 years is pretty well inescapable.
[02:27:01.971 --> 02:27:10.837]  I think we're going to see a global debt crisis that'll make the 2007-2008 crisis look very small by comparison before it's over.
[02:27:10.837 --> 02:27:13.679]  So Trump won't be able to stop that.
[02:27:13.679 --> 02:27:14.800]  But he can do a lot.
[02:27:15.606 --> 02:27:17.968]  To support the U.S.
[02:27:17.968 --> 02:27:24.855]  dollar as a strong currency by reducing taxes, by reducing the federal debt.
[02:27:24.855 --> 02:27:29.359]  And he's already going a long way toward that.
[02:27:29.359 --> 02:27:32.082]  We want to break in a few minutes, but let me start asking this question now.
[02:27:32.082 --> 02:27:33.263]  You're an expert on relocation.
[02:27:33.263 --> 02:27:35.325]  We were talking about this a decade ago, but now.
[02:27:37.017 --> 02:27:38.418]  It's in every major big publication.
[02:27:38.418 --> 02:27:57.811]  The elites are getting these fortresses, these armored keeps, these castles in remote areas of Tasmania, off the coast of Australia, or the Cook Islands, or areas in the middle of Eastern Europe, or they're running to remote islands of Hawaii, like Kauai.
[02:27:57.811 --> 02:28:02.073]  I mean, they know something big's coming, and now the publications are saying it's coming.
[02:28:02.073 --> 02:28:02.894]  What do you think's behind that?
[02:28:04.198 --> 02:28:22.547]  Well, I think you can't suppress the truth too long, and a lot of people who have made an honest living and have built up pretty large fortunes for their families are seeing the handwriting on the wall, and they're developing an exit strategy.
[02:28:22.547 --> 02:28:24.668]  You can't blame them for doing so.
[02:28:24.668 --> 02:28:30.451]  Most of these folks, you know, the Peter Thiels of the world, are forward-thinking individuals.
[02:28:30.451 --> 02:28:33.793]  They have a good-sized budget.
[02:28:34.562 --> 02:28:38.784]  They can think through the chain of events that's going to happen.
[02:28:38.784 --> 02:28:41.726]  Again, it all goes back to global debt.
[02:28:41.726 --> 02:28:44.567]  It's the main trigger for all this.
[02:28:44.567 --> 02:28:50.210]  And you can't blame them for building themselves well-stocked retreats offshore.
[02:28:50.210 --> 02:28:52.932]  And there's a lot in my consulting business.
[02:28:52.932 --> 02:28:58.915]  I've run a few across quite a few millionaires who are building retreats right here in the United States.
[02:28:58.915 --> 02:29:01.316]  You can't blame them for doing so.
[02:29:01.316 --> 02:29:02.377]  And I think
[02:29:03.462 --> 02:29:11.290]  Individual citizens of this nation should wake up to what's happening and realize they can make some preparations of their own on a very modest budget.
[02:29:11.290 --> 02:29:14.093]  And in the next segment, I'd love to talk about that.
[02:29:14.093 --> 02:29:21.741]  Let's do that because you look at Venezuela, as wealthy as the United States 55 years ago,
[02:29:23.502 --> 02:29:31.466]  In mainline economic journals, now a veritable road warrior Mad Max scenario.
[02:29:31.466 --> 02:29:33.427]  And it's only getting worse.
[02:29:33.427 --> 02:29:38.669]  So I want to look at our future through the lens of Venezuela.
[02:29:38.669 --> 02:29:40.670]  I think the establishment doesn't want to go the Venezuelan route.
[02:29:40.670 --> 02:29:44.512]  They want a pure authoritarian regime for a controlled implosion.
[02:29:44.512 --> 02:29:48.434]  But Trump is sabotaging that with a soft landing.
[02:29:50.222 --> 02:29:54.150]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.150 --> 02:29:56.815]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.562 --> 02:30:10.384]  Remember when we used to say, if you think the liberals hate Donald Trump now, just wait until he delivers on his campaign promises.
[02:30:10.384 --> 02:30:11.424]  Well, guess what?
[02:30:11.424 --> 02:30:15.625]  It's happening, and the liberals are losing their freaking minds.
[02:30:15.625 --> 02:30:20.026]  What could be defined and construed as a dark speech.
[02:30:20.026 --> 02:30:24.027]  This will be the day that the United States resigned as the leader of the free world.
[02:30:24.027 --> 02:30:26.047]  I have such rage and sadness.
[02:30:26.047 --> 02:30:29.508]  We just watched a dangerous little man give a very, very scary speech.
[02:30:29.588 --> 02:30:33.191]  Michael Moore called it a crime against humanity.
[02:30:33.191 --> 02:30:36.434]  And Bette Midler tweeted that there has never in U.S.
[02:30:36.434 --> 02:30:42.119]  history been such a destructive and megalomaniac in the White House as Donald Trump.
[02:30:42.119 --> 02:30:44.562]  Newsflash to liberals.
[02:30:44.562 --> 02:30:50.207]  60 million plus Americans voted for Trump because of his campaign promises.
[02:30:50.467 --> 02:30:57.257]  And the president is delivering based on real science and done with an America First attitude.
[02:30:57.257 --> 02:30:59.821]  You can learn more right now at Infowars.com.

[02:32:01.280 --> 02:32:15.610]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[02:32:15.610 --> 02:32:18.472]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[02:32:18.472 --> 02:32:22.414]  It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[02:32:22.414 --> 02:32:23.355]  This group of specials
[02:32:23.655 --> 02:32:34.767]  For 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.
[02:32:34.767 --> 02:32:39.593]  We have over a thousand high-quality products available that are discounted at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:39.793 --> 02:32:42.695]  You add AutoShip, several of these are lost leaders.

[02:33:12.022 --> 02:33:27.035]  Right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:27.035 --> 02:33:29.617]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the Kathy Griffin contest.
[02:33:30.575 --> 02:33:34.460]  Because that's the zeitgeist she really tied into saying, you know, basically cut the president's head off.
[02:33:34.460 --> 02:33:38.424]  It ties into all the other reporters saying, kill the president.
[02:33:38.424 --> 02:33:42.909]  Well, they actually come out and say, you know, ISIS, please blow up Trump towers on MSNBC.
[02:33:42.909 --> 02:33:46.694]  Their anti-terrorism expert says that?
[02:33:46.694 --> 02:33:49.177]  ISIS, there's hundreds of targets, please attack Trump facilities.
[02:33:50.814 --> 02:33:56.779]  This is them trying to build up this summer of rage that Soros admittedly is funding, that they admit they're engaged in.
[02:33:56.779 --> 02:34:02.864]  I don't get how they're allowed to engage in such mass organization for sedition.
[02:34:02.864 --> 02:34:05.166]  Because they're trying to overthrow the Republic.
[02:34:05.166 --> 02:34:07.368]  We have peacefully gone in by educating the public.
[02:34:08.655 --> 02:34:14.060]  And had a counter-revolution peacefully to get a beachhead in Washington to start changing things.
[02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:16.482]  But that's only in the locale.
[02:34:16.482 --> 02:34:19.305]  And America is the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[02:34:19.305 --> 02:34:24.730]  As James Rosie Rawls was saying earlier, and all the top economists I've talked to concur with what he just said.
[02:34:24.730 --> 02:34:30.315]  Trump could maybe get us into a decent position, but then if things implode outside the country,
[02:34:31.351 --> 02:34:43.034]  It's gonna get bad, and listen, you take the millennials, not all of them, but a lot of them, totally spoiled, entitled, a lot of the public is absolutely pissed off, brainwashed, they're ready to burn everything down, black, white, doesn't matter.
[02:34:43.034 --> 02:34:54.917]  I mean, I have leftists all over just walk up to me and say the most incredible threats, and it'll be like some 150-pound guy, and I'm not even being threatened, I'm like, dude, you understand, this isn't a simulation, this isn't a video game.
[02:34:54.917 --> 02:34:56.038]  You're talking to a 250-pound guy, okay?
[02:34:58.183 --> 02:34:59.403]  Who's almost pure muscle.
[02:34:59.403 --> 02:35:06.585]  I'm not saying I'm the toughest guy around, but I mean, you know, you're writing checks that your body can't cash.
[02:35:06.585 --> 02:35:11.066]  And that's what's so crazy about watching these people that are not in the real world.
[02:35:11.066 --> 02:35:18.728]  It's almost like they're emerging into the real world as the MSM crashes, as globalism crashes, as the people awaken.
[02:35:18.728 --> 02:35:24.430]  There's those that were so in the system, they just kind of halfway awaken, but then defend the system because they see it collapsing.
[02:35:25.452 --> 02:35:28.696]  But the system was designed to collapse and bring in a technocracy.
[02:35:28.696 --> 02:35:36.024]  They think Trump and James Leslie Rawls are collapsing it because we're not agreeing with it.
[02:35:36.024 --> 02:35:41.430]  When we're actually trying to build a future because we don't want to evacuate to Kauai, even though it's looking better every day.
[02:35:42.512 --> 02:35:51.416]  So I'll go to James Posey Rawls in a moment, survivalblog.com, talk about how the elites are getting prepared, why they're getting out, where he sees this going, and hopefully there's some way to turn this around.
[02:35:51.416 --> 02:35:53.177]  Some people say, well, are we supposed to evacuate?
[02:35:53.177 --> 02:35:54.117]  We're all screwed?
[02:35:54.117 --> 02:35:55.678]  Or is Trump making things better?
[02:35:55.678 --> 02:36:01.701]  I don't know why some people get confused by multifaceted, multivariate systems.
[02:36:01.701 --> 02:36:02.901]  Offense, defense.
[02:36:02.901 --> 02:36:04.762]  North, south, east, west.
[02:36:04.762 --> 02:36:05.983]  Leisure time, work time.
[02:36:08.516 --> 02:36:16.921]  I'm hoping to fix the country, but I'm also more and more, even though I see positive signs, looking for ways to protect my family.
[02:36:16.921 --> 02:36:19.723]  That's normal.
[02:36:19.723 --> 02:36:20.623]  Like getting insurance.
[02:36:20.623 --> 02:36:22.604]  It doesn't mean I want to get sick.
[02:36:22.604 --> 02:36:24.325]  I have the insurance.
[02:36:24.325 --> 02:36:27.647]  And so there's a lot bigger things than trusting in some insurance company.
[02:36:29.167 --> 02:36:31.569]  Trusting in yourself, your family, friends you can trust.
[02:36:31.569 --> 02:36:34.932]  And you know, those of us that are real, we tend to get really real with our families and friends.
[02:36:34.932 --> 02:36:35.833]  We're not in zombie mode.
[02:36:35.833 --> 02:36:37.254]  It's fun to be in a zombie mode.
[02:36:37.254 --> 02:36:42.378]  Then we kind of get mean to our friends, mean to our family sometimes, because things are so intense.
[02:36:42.378 --> 02:36:45.641]  We tend to be more aggressive with those we trust because they're actually awake.
[02:36:45.641 --> 02:36:47.402]  You're telling them your innermost secrets.
[02:36:47.402 --> 02:36:50.685]  They then think, oh my God, you don't care about me because you're so angry.
[02:36:50.685 --> 02:36:51.846]  It's the opposite.
[02:36:51.846 --> 02:36:57.191]  I'm being real with you, the audience, because I care about you and I'm hoping you can save us.
[02:36:58.496 --> 02:36:59.738]  That's why I'm so desperate.
[02:36:59.738 --> 02:37:02.541]  I'm trying as hard as I can to the point of exhaustion.
[02:37:02.541 --> 02:37:03.382]  I'm not complaining.
[02:37:03.382 --> 02:37:06.426]  I'm just saying I can't pick the planet up by myself.
[02:37:06.426 --> 02:37:08.488]  Together we can be Atlas with God's help.
[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:19.144]  We ran some of the biggest specials that Buckley and Anthony came up with that we've had ever.
[02:37:19.144 --> 02:37:25.590]  And I always say, oh, this is a big special, that's a big special, because we have hundreds of products, and sometimes I am, you know, every week offering something for the lowest price ever.

[02:37:59.216 --> 02:38:00.476]  That's untold.
[02:38:00.476 --> 02:38:01.396]  All the Trump shirts, 75% off.
[02:38:02.930 --> 02:38:12.077]  His shirts were great sellers, then they got unpopular for a month, now they're back being great sellers, but I've got them at cost because I want to flood the world with them and have free speech out there.
[02:38:12.077 --> 02:38:18.162]  A Trump shirt's like a bottle of holy water, a big silver cross, like Rawls said earlier, to these people.
[02:38:18.162 --> 02:38:20.063]  They expect you to live in fear.
[02:38:20.063 --> 02:38:21.244]  They expect you to roll over.
[02:38:21.244 --> 02:38:23.045]  But say you don't want to be that hardcore.
[02:38:23.045 --> 02:38:25.727]  Wear a Conservatism's the New Counterculture, Paul Watson shirt.
[02:38:26.568 --> 02:38:31.033]  Or where something everybody agrees on, like 94%, the mainstream media is the enemy.
[02:38:31.033 --> 02:38:35.017]  The image of Kathy Griffin holding up a severed head that says CNN terrorist.
[02:38:35.017 --> 02:38:36.138]  Media terrorist.
[02:38:36.138 --> 02:38:38.581]  You know, I like that one that Robert made, but go back to the main page.
[02:38:38.581 --> 02:38:39.422]  I'll show you my favorite one.
[02:38:41.548 --> 02:38:42.529]  Those are $14.95.
[02:38:42.529 --> 02:38:43.771]  We can pay for the contest.
[02:38:43.771 --> 02:38:46.574]  Yeah, click on that corner one, that left corner one, please.
[02:38:46.574 --> 02:38:48.035]  CNN terrorist.
[02:38:48.035 --> 02:38:49.016]  That's the iconic one.
[02:38:49.016 --> 02:38:50.798]  It says CNN terrorist under it.
[02:38:50.798 --> 02:38:54.902]  It's got that red and blue iconography like the famous Obama poster.
[02:38:54.902 --> 02:38:56.684]  And then you meet like-minded people.
[02:38:56.684 --> 02:38:58.446]  You all agree that we all hate the media.
[02:38:58.446 --> 02:38:59.868]  This is the shirt.
[02:39:01.308 --> 02:39:05.929]  We make 10 bucks on it, or a little bit less, we can fund the $200,000 contest.
[02:39:05.929 --> 02:39:08.610]  And I think we'll sell enough shirts to fund that.
[02:39:08.610 --> 02:39:10.571]  Get on TV with a shirt like this.
[02:39:10.571 --> 02:39:11.431]  Make your own poster.
[02:39:11.431 --> 02:39:13.231]  We have PDF files on the site.
[02:39:13.231 --> 02:39:13.892]  Make your own.
[02:39:13.892 --> 02:39:17.152]  Or just say, MSM is fake news.
[02:39:17.152 --> 02:39:18.273]  CNN's fake news.
[02:39:19.333 --> 02:39:22.595]  MSNBC's fake news, InfoWars.com, whatever.
[02:39:22.595 --> 02:39:24.676]  It's about showing them the power of the people.
[02:39:24.676 --> 02:39:28.418]  The Bill Clinton rape contest sent shockwaves across the world.
[02:39:28.418 --> 02:39:29.459]  This one's going to be even bigger.
[02:39:29.459 --> 02:39:31.080]  This is the fake news contest.
[02:39:31.080 --> 02:39:32.160]  Do whatever you want.
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:35.802]  If it plugs InfoWars and it's spectacular, $2,500.
[02:39:35.802 --> 02:39:40.805]  If you just get InfoWars.com on air and one of the shirts on, clearly $1,000.
[02:39:40.805 --> 02:39:43.687]  But believe me, I paid out to over $100,000 last time.
[02:39:43.687 --> 02:39:44.867]  I said I'd do $100,000, it's like $140,000-something.
[02:39:46.872 --> 02:39:49.159]  I said 120 and the accountant said no it was 140 Alex.
[02:39:49.159 --> 02:39:51.226]  And please don't go over this time because you barely got that much money.
[02:39:52.423 --> 02:39:53.444]  I don't care about the money.
[02:39:53.444 --> 02:39:56.365]  The money is a tool to wage war against tyrants.
[02:39:56.365 --> 02:39:58.345]  Do you know the power?
[02:39:58.345 --> 02:39:59.706]  And a lot of you say, I don't want $1,000.
[02:39:59.706 --> 02:40:00.166]  Fine.
[02:40:00.166 --> 02:40:02.167]  Call into C-SPAN with them, FortWorth.com.
[02:40:02.167 --> 02:40:03.467]  Call and talk radio.
[02:40:03.467 --> 02:40:04.328]  Talk about the contest.
[02:40:04.328 --> 02:40:05.028]  Whatever.
[02:40:05.028 --> 02:40:06.368]  Other people do your own contest.
[02:40:06.368 --> 02:40:07.809]  Just get aggressive.
[02:40:07.809 --> 02:40:09.509]  Now going back to James Wesley Rawls.
[02:40:09.509 --> 02:40:11.410]  I know you talk about the general public can get prepared.
[02:40:11.410 --> 02:40:14.711]  And I know they should be with water filtration.
[02:40:14.711 --> 02:40:16.132]  But I think just be prepared now.
[02:40:16.132 --> 02:40:17.512]  Don't eat GMO.
[02:40:17.512 --> 02:40:18.373]  Reach out in your community.
[02:40:19.821 --> 02:40:21.603]  Having an escape route out of these big cities.
[02:40:21.603 --> 02:40:26.147]  If you're in L.A., if you're in Chicago, if you're in... Let me ask you this.
[02:40:26.147 --> 02:40:31.833]  One of the top survivalists in the world, formerly Army Intelligence, James Leslie Rawls, best-selling author, survivalblog.com.
[02:40:31.833 --> 02:40:33.074]  Let me ask you this.
[02:40:33.074 --> 02:40:37.418]  What are the most dangerous places in the United States to live, and where would you live?
[02:40:37.418 --> 02:40:40.101]  Because the average person's got to have a job, they got to, you know, pay for themselves.
[02:40:41.215 --> 02:40:47.557]  Well, obviously, I think the most dangerous places are the major population centers.
[02:40:47.557 --> 02:40:51.118]  So, all up and down the East Coast, and then the L.A.
[02:40:51.118 --> 02:41:03.961]  metropolitan area, and to a lesser extent, perhaps Dallas-Fort Worth, but certainly Chicago, that entire metropolitan region that stretches for many, many miles.
[02:41:03.961 --> 02:41:06.742]  You don't want to be in a major population center.
[02:41:07.552 --> 02:41:13.140]  And even if you're in the suburbs, things could be very difficult and downright dangerous for you.
[02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:25.456]  If you have the opportunity, I recommend that all your viewers and listeners consider relocating to a lightly populated food producing region, whether that's a farming region or ranching region.
[02:41:25.456 --> 02:41:25.596]  But
[02:41:26.258 --> 02:41:33.182]  In either case, it has to be well removed from major population centers because that's where the terrorist targets are.
[02:41:33.182 --> 02:41:38.965]  That's where if there's ever a clampdown or martial law, that's where it will occur.
[02:41:38.965 --> 02:41:51.933]  And that's where people are the most vulnerable because the chains of supply terminate at those major metropolitan regions.
[02:41:51.933 --> 02:41:55.695]  You want to be in an area where food is produced and where power is produced.
[02:41:56.824 --> 02:42:05.009]  That exports, you don't want to be in the area, in a big city, where they import power, import food, import water.
[02:42:05.009 --> 02:42:07.530]  That's where you're the most vulnerable.
[02:42:07.530 --> 02:42:13.234]  And of course, break down from the historical research the Pentagon's done, the British have done the same, obviously, in even war zones.
[02:42:13.234 --> 02:42:20.258]  But what is it, 10 days most people become killers, 5 days most people become thieves, 10 days killers, 15 cannibals.
[02:42:21.850 --> 02:42:23.611]  It could come down to that very easily.
[02:42:23.611 --> 02:42:30.554]  And we have a society where the average family only has a three-day supply of food on hand.
[02:42:30.554 --> 02:42:38.358]  And that's why I highly recommend that everyone listening to my voice right now seriously consider stocking up for your family.
[02:42:38.358 --> 02:42:46.122]  And not just food, but you'll need water filtration and you'll also need supplements because storage food, just by its very nature,
[02:42:46.773 --> 02:42:51.735]  It's not as nutritionally rich as fresh foods.
[02:42:51.735 --> 02:42:59.257]  So you'll need supplements, you'll need water filtration, and you'll need plenty of bulk storage food.
[02:42:59.257 --> 02:43:01.818]  And stock up deep, folks.
[02:43:01.818 --> 02:43:07.220]  The deeper your larder, the safer you'll be.
[02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:10.101]  What else are you looking at that concerns you around the world?
[02:43:11.823 --> 02:43:12.824]  Wow.
[02:43:12.824 --> 02:43:24.774]  Well, mainly the economy is my main concern because that's something that is going to come back and bite us regardless of what happens with the Trump administration because we're in a global economy.
[02:43:24.774 --> 02:43:30.139]  There's massive levels of debt that have built up, both public and private.
[02:43:31.235 --> 02:43:34.978]  And eventually, that's going to come back and bite us.
[02:43:34.978 --> 02:43:38.762]  And when it does, we need to be prepared as families.
[02:43:38.762 --> 02:43:43.586]  And we need to be in a position where we can make a difference.
[02:43:43.586 --> 02:43:48.070]  And if someone is worried about where they're going to find their next meal for their family,
[02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:49.690]  They're not innocent.
[02:43:49.690 --> 02:44:00.054]  They haven't put themselves in a situation where they're looking at the big picture and where they really can make a difference in terms of helping to rebuild society and being politically active and aware.
[02:44:00.054 --> 02:44:03.796]  If you're scrambling for your next meal, you're not part of the solution.
[02:44:03.796 --> 02:44:05.476]  You're part of the problem.
[02:44:05.476 --> 02:44:05.877]  That's right.
[02:44:05.877 --> 02:44:09.258]  During a breakdown or crisis, it's those that are already secure that become the
[02:44:10.168 --> 02:44:15.571]  De facto leaders and the globalists always have used collapse as a tool to bring in control.
[02:44:15.571 --> 02:44:16.852]  That's the globalist model.
[02:44:16.852 --> 02:44:29.260]  We have to be at the micro level prepared so that we can provide the leadership, not because we want power, but because locally we better be involved in the new leadership or we will be dominated by some outside collapsed
[02:44:29.660 --> 02:44:43.963]  Super city that will then reorganize kind of into a warlord type scenario So we're not ready for that a year after we move to the country after collapse and think we're safe There'll be a whole armored column coming down the road to take over your town Right.
[02:44:43.963 --> 02:44:57.866]  Yeah, I think it's important that we have we need to recognize that the solutions to these problems are going to come from the grassroots from the bottom up terms of restoring the Constitution and restoring a sound currency
[02:44:59.017 --> 02:45:02.118]  And rebuilding a vibrant economy.
[02:45:02.118 --> 02:45:02.558]  Exactly.
[02:45:02.558 --> 02:45:07.560]  This could actually be a positive thing, like the Black Plague, that I'm not endorsing, but killed out the population roughly of Europe.
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:13.241]  The Renaissance came out of that because it wiped out all the corrupt elites, all the state systems that wouldn't let people have a free market.
[02:45:13.241 --> 02:45:17.963]  It forced the population back to their original roots and created the whole new economy.
[02:45:17.963 --> 02:45:18.963]  Right.
[02:45:18.963 --> 02:45:21.424]  So, folks, wake up.
[02:45:21.424 --> 02:45:27.886]  And once you're awake and aware with the information you have that you learned from InfoWars, you need to stock up.
[02:45:28.695 --> 02:45:33.267]  And team up and train up to be ready for this.
[02:45:33.267 --> 02:45:34.551]  It's just common sense.
[02:45:34.551 --> 02:45:35.132]  It's biblical.
[02:45:36.045 --> 02:45:40.369]  And it's something that can be done on a fairly modest budget.
[02:45:40.369 --> 02:45:43.772]  Let me ask you this just selfishly, because I look at these things.
[02:45:43.772 --> 02:45:47.876]  Why are so many elites moving to, say, Kauai or other very remote Hawaiian islands?
[02:45:47.876 --> 02:45:48.777]  Why are they moving to Tasmania?
[02:45:48.777 --> 02:45:50.839]  Because the word is, that's where a lot of them are going.
[02:45:50.839 --> 02:45:51.739]  They're not on beaches.
[02:45:51.739 --> 02:45:58.385]  They're getting hilltop deals, putting 20-foot walls in, you know, putting machine guns in, putting food in, helicopter pads.
[02:45:58.385 --> 02:45:59.987]  Why are they running to the Pacific Ocean?
[02:46:00.919 --> 02:46:07.343]  Well, the advantage of the island nations is that they have the ultimate in geographic isolation.
[02:46:07.343 --> 02:46:09.945]  Also, they have independent power.
[02:46:09.945 --> 02:46:18.250]  Of course, in Hawaii, they're dependent upon shiploads of liquefied natural gas arriving.
[02:46:18.250 --> 02:46:24.355]  But an individual compound or bunker can be very well stocked for years.
[02:46:24.355 --> 02:46:26.376]  And if there's going to be a population die-off,
[02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:32.706]  If you're on an island that is not too heavily populated to begin with, you're probably going to be sitting pretty.
[02:46:32.706 --> 02:46:37.250]  You know, not everyone has the budget to make that kind of move.
[02:46:37.250 --> 02:46:40.293]  And again, Kauai, Hawaii is the most remote islands in the world.
[02:46:40.293 --> 02:46:42.375]  Kauai is the most remote of the remote.
[02:46:42.375 --> 02:46:44.077]  And again, I'm just telling people I've done my own study.
[02:46:44.077 --> 02:46:46.379]  That's where the big money's moving.
[02:46:46.379 --> 02:46:47.440]  Right.
[02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:51.404]  But even even though the the I wouldn't want to be anywhere near
[02:46:52.213 --> 02:46:53.315]  I want to.
[02:46:53.315 --> 02:46:56.279]  Because it's grossly overpopulated.
[02:46:56.279 --> 02:46:58.842]  It's probably the worst time bomb there is, they say.
[02:46:58.842 --> 02:46:59.423]  Right.
[02:46:59.423 --> 02:47:00.685]  It's grossly overpopulated.
[02:47:00.685 --> 02:47:04.470]  But the Big Island and Kauai would be quite survivable.
[02:47:05.265 --> 02:47:08.266]  At least the dry side of the Big Island.
[02:47:08.266 --> 02:47:14.887]  The Hilo area might see some serious chaos, but the dry side, the western side of the Big Island.
[02:47:14.887 --> 02:47:15.387]  Let's blow that up.
[02:47:15.387 --> 02:47:16.347]  That's what I love about you, Rawls.
[02:47:16.347 --> 02:47:20.468]  I've got nobody on but you and, say, Joel Scouser that knows basically every area of the world.
[02:47:20.468 --> 02:47:21.188]  Let's blow that up.
[02:47:21.188 --> 02:47:22.968]  Yeah, Hilo's a bad spot.
[02:47:22.968 --> 02:47:26.469]  Big Island's mainly like a wasteland with a volcano, but it's got a bunch of ranches up on top.
[02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:28.229]  Some of the biggest in the world are there.
[02:47:28.229 --> 02:47:29.189]  But go look at Kauai.
[02:47:29.189 --> 02:47:32.450]  I'm not trying to advertise this, folks, but I personally, if I'm going to have to
[02:47:32.990 --> 02:47:33.912]  We're good to go.
[02:47:43.940 --> 02:47:59.867]  Slash super hardcore Calvinist that 170 years ago went and bought that from the king fair and square that's called the Forbidden Island that most westerly there That island literally has about 200 people that live on it.
[02:47:59.867 --> 02:48:01.347]  That is just west of Kauai.
[02:48:01.347 --> 02:48:02.808]  What do you make of the Forbidden Island of Hawaii?
[02:48:03.891 --> 02:48:16.419]  Well, it's only open to Native Hawaiians, and I certainly, if I was with an NGO or something operating there, I wouldn't actually feel very comfortable living there in the midst of a collapse.
[02:48:16.419 --> 02:48:25.585]  There's probably a handful of non-Native Hawaiians on the so-called Forbidden Island.
[02:48:25.585 --> 02:48:32.269]  It's actually pretty self-sufficient, as would be Kauai, if everything fell apart.
[02:48:33.174 --> 02:48:39.699]  But again, most people's budgets aren't going to allow them to move to Hawaii or to Tasmania or wherever.
[02:48:39.699 --> 02:48:40.580]  No, I totally agree.
[02:48:40.580 --> 02:48:42.682]  I actually investigated that island, but that's true.
[02:48:42.682 --> 02:48:47.886]  They also have day hunting trips for like Hawaiian sheep and wild hogs, but yeah.
[02:48:47.886 --> 02:48:49.307]  And you think about how big Kauai is.
[02:48:49.307 --> 02:48:51.088]  That island's a third the size of it.
[02:48:51.088 --> 02:48:52.269]  It's gigantic.
[02:48:52.269 --> 02:48:54.231]  It's the size of like Dallas.
[02:48:54.231 --> 02:48:55.071]  And there's like 200 people on it.
[02:48:57.292 --> 02:49:00.714]  Yeah, it would be very survivable.
[02:49:00.714 --> 02:49:09.659]  In the Pacific, the island nations that I like the best are Vanuatu, Niue, and the Cook Islands.
[02:49:09.659 --> 02:49:17.383]  And partly because, at least on Vanuatu, you can actually own a gun, and it has a fairly small
[02:49:19.557 --> 02:49:36.565]  Unobtrusive government and the economies of all three of those island nations are such that they can revert to a subsistence level of agriculture and fishing in the event of a global collapse.
[02:49:36.565 --> 02:49:42.448]  And they're not grossly overpopulated like some other islands.
[02:49:42.448 --> 02:49:43.128]  It's amazing.
[02:49:43.128 --> 02:49:44.208]  I gotta tell you, Kalaya is so pretty.
[02:49:44.208 --> 02:49:46.469]  That's where they film all the King Kong and Jurassic Park movies.
[02:49:46.469 --> 02:49:46.910]  It's crazy.
[02:49:46.910 --> 02:49:47.570]  Have you ever been there?
[02:49:49.140 --> 02:49:50.360]  Actually, I've been to the Big Island.
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:53.121]  I haven't been to Kauai.
[02:49:53.121 --> 02:50:07.686]  But if you look at it demographically, and in terms of square acres per person, you know, if you're going to go back to a pigs and poi economy, you could do that on Kauai.
[02:50:07.686 --> 02:50:08.086]  You cannot.
[02:50:08.086 --> 02:50:11.767]  They got tobacco, coffee, bananas, water, everything there.
[02:50:11.767 --> 02:50:13.807]  You literally, it's a self-sufficient island.
[02:50:13.807 --> 02:50:14.568]  It's just amazing.
[02:50:14.568 --> 02:50:15.368]  You go walk through
[02:50:17.072 --> 02:50:21.714]  You know, people's yards, much less the jungle, there are mangoes, papayas, guavas.
[02:50:21.714 --> 02:50:23.334]  Everything is there.
[02:50:23.334 --> 02:50:28.556]  If you starve on populated islands of Hawaii, you're a fool.
[02:50:28.556 --> 02:50:29.837]  That's why there are symbols of roosters.
[02:50:29.837 --> 02:50:31.617]  There are chickens everywhere.
[02:50:31.617 --> 02:50:36.299]  Yeah, and a lot of families raise pigs.
[02:50:36.299 --> 02:50:38.880]  There's all sorts of poultry.
[02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:44.922]  And what I liked is the Hawaiians there are like really into being anti-establishment and almost all of them are listeners.
[02:50:46.451 --> 02:50:56.805]  Really, so I think if folks have the opportunity to relocate, if they're self-employed or whatever, the islands are something to consider.
[02:50:56.805 --> 02:50:58.067]  All right, stay right there.
[02:50:58.067 --> 02:50:58.708]  Let's come right back.
[02:51:00.976 --> 02:51:06.278]  Being self-reliant is about being prepared and to do what you need to have your own source of renewable energy.
[02:51:06.278 --> 02:51:12.580]  Portable Solar LLC offers the most powerful EMP-hardened solar system on the market that is transportable from place to place.
[02:51:12.580 --> 02:51:13.440]  And the best part?
[02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:14.361]  It's very affordable.
[02:51:14.361 --> 02:51:18.162]  Contact them at PortableSolarLLC.com or call for details at 972-575-8875.
[02:51:18.162 --> 02:51:24.524]  Sol-Arc EMP-hardened solar generator energy insurance for your family or business.

[02:51:30.786 --> 02:51:35.571]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[02:51:35.571 --> 02:51:41.458]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[02:51:41.458 --> 02:51:47.985]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[02:51:47.985 --> 02:51:51.749]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[02:51:52.389 --> 02:52:14.140]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today fight their hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[02:52:14.660 --> 02:52:17.462]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[02:52:17.462 --> 02:52:21.406]  It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[02:52:21.406 --> 02:52:33.696]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.

[02:52:59.835 --> 02:53:04.957]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[02:53:04.957 --> 02:53:10.658]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[02:53:10.658 --> 02:53:15.860]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[02:53:15.860 --> 02:53:17.801]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[02:53:17.801 --> 02:53:20.181]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[02:53:20.181 --> 02:53:21.142]  See guidelines.
[02:53:21.142 --> 02:53:24.423]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.
[02:53:24.423 --> 02:53:26.363]  Go to LibertyOnCall.org.
[02:53:26.363 --> 02:53:27.924]  That's LibertyOnCall.org.
[02:53:29.764 --> 02:53:32.786]  Love or loathe him, Donald J. Trump is our 45th president.
[02:53:32.786 --> 02:53:37.350]  There is no denying now that Trump will go down in history, both despised and admired.
[02:53:37.350 --> 02:53:42.414]  Commemorate Trump's presidency with your very own Trump Silver Bust from TrumpSilverStatue.com.

[02:54:11.443 --> 02:54:14.064]  Rob Doo is steaming mad.
[02:54:14.064 --> 02:54:17.145]  And he's going to be popping in with Cernovich later in the fourth hour.
[02:54:17.145 --> 02:54:19.026]  Mike Cernovich coming up.
[02:54:19.026 --> 02:54:21.707]  Kathy Griffin, who did that whole stunt, failed comedian.
[02:54:21.707 --> 02:54:23.408]  I don't say that to be mean.
[02:54:23.408 --> 02:54:24.348]  I mean, she's a failed comedian.
[02:54:24.348 --> 02:54:27.549]  It's who she is.
[02:54:27.549 --> 02:54:35.012]  You've heard him attack Barron and say he's a serial killer and a mass shooter and, you know, everybody hopes he dies and kill Trump and all the rest of this.
[02:54:35.916 --> 02:54:37.476]  Well, first she comes out and says she's sorry.
[02:54:37.476 --> 02:54:43.097]  Now she says she's not sorry because, you know, he's a misogynist and men write her paycheck.
[02:54:43.097 --> 02:54:43.698]  I'm not kidding.
[02:54:43.698 --> 02:54:46.738]  I played the clip last hour.
[02:54:46.738 --> 02:54:52.779]  She says that they've bullied her and that Trump should apologize to her.
[02:54:52.779 --> 02:54:55.820]  Talk about an insane doubling down.
[02:54:55.820 --> 02:54:59.101]  Should Trump apologize for this report?
[02:54:59.101 --> 02:55:00.401]  This is on InfoWars.com.
[02:55:00.401 --> 02:55:01.181]  It's going up right now.
[02:55:02.745 --> 02:55:06.708]  Kathy Griffin thinks comedy should go all out.
[02:55:06.708 --> 02:55:08.809]  Kathy Griffin thinks comedy should go all out.
[02:55:08.809 --> 02:55:10.430]  President a piece of S.H.
[02:55:10.430 --> 02:55:12.672]  you know what T. Donald Trump.
[02:55:12.672 --> 02:55:14.053]  Quote.
[02:55:14.053 --> 02:55:16.654]  This is December of last year when he was president elect.
[02:55:16.654 --> 02:55:21.718]  So I'm happy to deliver beat down to Donald Trump and also to Barron.
[02:55:22.645 --> 02:55:26.166]  You know, a lot of comics are going to go hard for Donald.
[02:55:26.166 --> 02:55:28.987]  My edge is that I'll go direct for Barron.
[02:55:28.987 --> 02:55:31.968]  I'm going to get in ahead of the game.
[02:55:31.968 --> 02:55:33.849]  Ahead of the game.
[02:55:33.849 --> 02:55:35.489]  Wow.
[02:55:35.489 --> 02:55:39.450]  It's from a woman that is a failure.
[02:55:39.450 --> 02:55:43.932]  So, the doubling, the tripling down, that's why she's the poster child for the arrogance of the left.
[02:55:44.804 --> 02:55:49.410]  That's why you should, we have the two new shirts I added today, part of the contest, just say CNN Fake News.
[02:55:49.410 --> 02:55:50.871]  You get that on TV, $1,000.
[02:55:50.871 --> 02:55:54.155]  Get InfoWars.com in on air, $2,500.
[02:55:54.155 --> 02:55:57.459]  I can't wait, send the videos to ContestInfoWars.com.
[02:55:57.459 --> 02:56:00.343]  I can't wait to see this ball rolling, like Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[02:56:01.561 --> 02:56:03.241]  Fourth hour with Cernovich coming up.
[02:56:03.241 --> 02:56:06.842]  James Wesley Rawls, best-selling author, researcher, survivalblog.com.
[02:56:06.842 --> 02:56:10.363]  You warned decades ago of radical Islam taking over, the left allied with it.
[02:56:10.363 --> 02:56:11.563]  Now it's out in the open.
[02:56:11.563 --> 02:56:13.583]  You've written books on the subject.
[02:56:13.583 --> 02:56:21.225]  Looking at that in other areas, will Trump be able to defeat this leftist alliance with Islam?
[02:56:21.225 --> 02:56:26.786]  I believe that he'll at least be able to hold America's ground in that regard.
[02:56:26.786 --> 02:56:30.747]  Obama was conceding left, right, and center.
[02:56:31.596 --> 02:56:34.539]  And basically, in fact, literally bowing to them.
[02:56:34.539 --> 02:56:37.081]  Well, he was coordinating the Arab Spring.
[02:56:37.081 --> 02:56:38.021]  Right.
[02:56:38.021 --> 02:56:42.385]  So at least Trump is going to do his best to hold his ground.
[02:56:42.385 --> 02:56:52.594]  And I think that even with the rising tide of Islam, we have the opportunity for America to be an example to the rest of the world.
[02:56:52.594 --> 02:56:53.274]  And you just said it.
[02:56:53.274 --> 02:56:56.117]  You're always just crystallizing things so quickly when I can't.
[02:56:56.117 --> 02:56:57.278]  We've got to hold our ground.
[02:56:57.278 --> 02:56:58.779]  That's all it's going to take is hold the ground.
[02:57:00.655 --> 02:57:10.590]  Certainly, because I think that Islam eventually will collapse in on itself into infighting between Sunni and Shia.
[02:57:10.590 --> 02:57:13.435]  I was about to say, the civil war will decimate their population.
[02:57:14.671 --> 02:57:16.072]  I think it will.
[02:57:16.072 --> 02:57:19.974]  So folks, we need to hold our ground as individual families as well.
[02:57:19.974 --> 02:57:23.576]  And please, do your best to support InfoWars.
[02:57:23.576 --> 02:57:28.558]  And one of the best ways you can do that is buying your supplements from InfoWars.
[02:57:28.558 --> 02:57:30.839]  That's one thing every family needs anyway.
[02:57:30.839 --> 02:57:32.240]  So please give your business there.
[02:57:33.260 --> 02:57:35.442]  And redouble your efforts, folks.
[02:57:35.442 --> 02:57:38.284]  It's time to, again, stock up, team up, and train up.
[02:57:38.284 --> 02:57:39.345]  And I'll just say this.
[02:57:39.345 --> 02:57:40.946]  People need to support you.
[02:57:40.946 --> 02:57:41.807]  Folks need to understand.
[02:57:41.807 --> 02:57:45.210]  I know the listeners are wonderful, great people, but we're under constant attack.
[02:57:45.210 --> 02:57:46.030]  We don't talk about it.
[02:57:46.030 --> 02:57:47.691]  We don't get into it because, you know, we're in a war.
[02:57:47.691 --> 02:57:48.052]  We get it.
[02:57:48.052 --> 02:57:48.532]  We ask for it.
[02:57:48.532 --> 02:57:49.553]  We're not complaining.
[02:57:49.553 --> 02:57:51.134]  We're just asking you to realize we're winning.
[02:57:51.134 --> 02:57:51.755]  You're winning.
[02:57:51.755 --> 02:57:52.195]  Together, just
[02:57:53.556 --> 02:57:55.036]  We need your support.
[02:57:55.036 --> 02:57:56.076]  And it's just like a video game.
[02:57:56.076 --> 02:58:02.818]  As we're fighting the big boss at the end of the level, as you support us financially, pray for us, spread our links, we get more energy.
[02:58:02.818 --> 02:58:05.678]  You're the little golden cubes we get in the video game.
[02:58:05.678 --> 02:58:07.939]  You're the little mushrooms we get in Mario Brothers.
[02:58:07.939 --> 02:58:09.579]  You're the ones that feed us.
[02:58:09.579 --> 02:58:10.399]  We're together.
[02:58:10.399 --> 02:58:11.539]  You are us.
[02:58:11.539 --> 02:58:17.761]  And when you pray for us, financially support us, buy Rawls' books, give them to folks that aren't awake yet, you are building an economy.
[02:58:17.761 --> 02:58:19.901]  The Clintons in their famous foundation document said,
[02:58:20.581 --> 02:58:26.784]  Uh, for their, for their, uh, not the new foundation, but the one with their, uh, their presidential foundation, their library was.
[02:58:26.784 --> 02:58:28.965]  We gotta stop a new conservative media from forming.
[02:58:28.965 --> 02:58:30.125]  Well, you failed!
[02:58:30.125 --> 02:58:32.366]  And now we've kicked your butt, thanks to God's graces.
[02:58:32.366 --> 02:58:34.027]  James Leslie Rawls, thank you so much.
[02:58:34.027 --> 02:58:35.048]  Have a great weekend.
[02:58:35.048 --> 02:58:38.709]  Survivalblog.com, we salute you.
[02:58:38.709 --> 02:58:40.630]  We'll be back with Mike Cerna, but stay with us.
[02:58:40.630 --> 02:58:41.891]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:58:41.891 --> 02:58:43.832]  And I'm gonna host a little bit into it.
[02:58:43.832 --> 02:58:46.053]  Cerna likes that, so I'll come on with him.
[02:58:51.298 --> 02:58:59.282]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:59.282 --> 02:59:05.925]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[02:59:05.925 --> 02:59:14.209]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[02:59:14.489 --> 02:59:20.358]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[02:59:20.358 --> 02:59:23.522]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[02:59:23.522 --> 02:59:29.251]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[02:59:29.591 --> 02:59:30.352]  It works.
[02:59:30.352 --> 02:59:38.677]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[02:59:38.677 --> 02:59:48.563]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the InfoWar against the globalists all at the same time.
[02:59:48.563 --> 02:59:53.806]  A total 360 win!
[02:59:53.806 --> 02:59:56.487]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:06.084 --> 03:00:12.966]  The globalists' great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[03:00:12.966 --> 03:00:19.409]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[03:00:21.869 --> 03:00:25.311]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:25.311 --> 03:00:26.511]  Okay.
[03:00:26.511 --> 03:00:27.932]  I don't like to crash Mike Cernovich.
[03:00:27.932 --> 03:00:34.595]  I got a lot of work to do and I like to listen to him walking around the office on my iPhone plugged into my earpieces while I'm doing stuff.
[03:00:34.595 --> 03:00:37.597]  But I'm going to be out of here in 15 minutes because he's got a guest coming up with a lot to cover.
[03:00:37.597 --> 03:00:42.219]  But I really need to play these clips that we got for you that nobody else has even talked about.
[03:00:42.219 --> 03:00:45.901]  Megyn Kelly, the Russian's had her over to host big forums and interview Putin.
[03:00:45.901 --> 03:00:47.062]  She told me about it two weeks ago.
[03:00:47.062 --> 03:00:49.283]  Asked me not to tell anybody, but now the interview's out there.
[03:00:50.325 --> 03:00:54.067]  She just attacks him and, you know, just acts like a crazy person.
[03:00:54.067 --> 03:00:55.728]  And Putin just slams her down.
[03:00:55.728 --> 03:00:57.169]  Those clips are coming up.
[03:00:57.169 --> 03:00:59.791]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[03:00:59.791 --> 03:01:08.656]  And then we've got this, this, this, this, you know, cut the president's head off lady, Kathy Griffin, doubling down and saying she's a victim of men.
[03:01:08.656 --> 03:01:11.758]  They write her paychecks and the president should apologize to her.
[03:01:11.758 --> 03:01:15.220]  Then we found this quote of her in December, six months ago.
[03:01:17.643 --> 03:01:22.187]  Saying, quote, so I'm happy to deliver beat down to Donald Trump, and also to Barron.
[03:01:22.187 --> 03:01:25.109]  You know a lot of comments are going to go hard for Donald.
[03:01:25.109 --> 03:01:27.270]  My edge is I'm going to go direct for Barron.
[03:01:27.270 --> 03:01:29.292]  I'm going to get in ahead of the game.
[03:01:29.292 --> 03:01:35.016]  So, she's now attacking Barron, the president, in the fakest crying I've ever seen.
[03:01:35.016 --> 03:01:37.799]  I do think the left is committing suicide.
[03:01:37.799 --> 03:01:39.280]  I mean, these are the biggest spoiled brats.
[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:40.681]  Mike Cernovich, what is going on?
[03:01:42.745 --> 03:01:44.926]  Yeah, I love it.
[03:01:44.926 --> 03:01:46.667]  I love what Kathy Griffin did today.
[03:01:46.667 --> 03:01:54.052]  She did a great thing for the movement to show that they have no contrition, they have no human decency.
[03:01:54.052 --> 03:01:55.793]  She ranted and raved.
[03:01:55.793 --> 03:02:04.598]  So what had happened is that, as you knew, you found out that Kathy Griffin and liberals will bully an 11-year-old child.
[03:02:04.598 --> 03:02:07.660]  Rosie O'Donnell, remember she spread that video?
[03:02:07.660 --> 03:02:10.101]  Oh, Barron, he's autistic.
[03:02:10.101 --> 03:02:11.182]  Trying to mock him, right?
[03:02:12.819 --> 03:02:13.820]  Yes.
[03:02:13.820 --> 03:02:18.325]  They all go after our children, which is what you have been saying for years and I've been saying for years.
[03:02:18.325 --> 03:02:19.226]  It's one thing.
[03:02:19.226 --> 03:02:22.309]  Well, I mean, look what the media did to you with your court battle and stuff.
[03:02:22.309 --> 03:02:24.672]  Your children will have to read that for years.
[03:02:24.672 --> 03:02:28.937]  I don't care if they come after me or you or anybody else, but they're going after our children.
[03:02:28.937 --> 03:02:32.761]  And by the way, when I basically won the court battle, the children won.
[03:02:32.761 --> 03:02:33.622]  It's not even in the news.
[03:02:35.054 --> 03:02:36.015]  Exactly.
[03:02:36.015 --> 03:02:39.738]  And that is because they, children aren't off limits now.
[03:02:39.738 --> 03:02:46.383]  Even in the mafia, even in organized crime, you never go after another person's child.
[03:02:46.383 --> 03:02:50.326]  The left, they don't even have the ethics of the mafia.
[03:02:50.326 --> 03:02:51.406]  That's because they're disconnected.
[03:02:51.406 --> 03:02:52.968]  It's not that the mafia are wimps.
[03:02:52.968 --> 03:02:54.389]  Why get people's kids in on it?
[03:02:54.389 --> 03:02:55.510]  They're not involved.
[03:02:55.510 --> 03:02:56.230]  Leave the kids out.
[03:02:56.230 --> 03:02:57.471]  Let men do the fighting.
[03:02:57.471 --> 03:02:58.452]  This is pussy world.
[03:03:00.086 --> 03:03:01.667]  Yeah, when they don't have any morality.
[03:03:01.667 --> 03:03:16.255]  And this is what happens in a world without a mooring to God, to religion, to Western civilization, where they can't understand that, okay, adults who are in the game, you can go after them hard.
[03:03:16.255 --> 03:03:22.599]  Speaking of children, my daughter is going to come up and grab Saira.
[03:03:22.599 --> 03:03:26.221]  She wants to talk to the Emperor.
[03:03:26.221 --> 03:03:28.402]  Yeah, we have a young Emperor right in the back.
[03:03:30.518 --> 03:03:31.578]  So that's the thing.
[03:03:31.578 --> 03:03:34.599]  They don't even think that children are off limits.
[03:03:34.599 --> 03:03:37.340]  Yeah, Alex, actually, we had Easter brunch with Syra.
[03:03:37.340 --> 03:03:38.121]  That was a lot of brunch.
[03:03:38.121 --> 03:03:38.661]  Put her on TV.
[03:03:38.661 --> 03:03:40.621]  I got three daughters.
[03:03:40.621 --> 03:03:43.603]  The FBI writing all this stuff that's going on.
[03:03:43.603 --> 03:03:46.143]  So, you know, Syra got to meet the great Alex Jones.
[03:03:46.143 --> 03:03:50.665]  Yeah, the Kathy Griffin stuff, it showed that they've completely lost their minds.
[03:03:50.665 --> 03:03:53.526]  But here's an interesting thing I've heard from a lot of liberal people.
[03:03:54.281 --> 03:04:02.588]  A lot of them have said, you know what, Cernovich, you and Alex Jones and other people, we hate to admit it, but you guys are right that we've gone too far.
[03:04:02.588 --> 03:04:08.492]  And we really need to do something about these left-wing... And it's not because they want to admit that they know it's hurting them.
[03:04:08.492 --> 03:04:10.454]  That's why they have Zarkaria coming out.
[03:04:10.454 --> 03:04:14.537]  It's why they've got the New York Times coming out, where they have no whites weekends at colleges.
[03:04:14.537 --> 03:04:15.658]  I mean, this is crazy!
[03:04:16.977 --> 03:04:20.940]  Yeah, they've gone too far and now they're losing influence and they can't win an election.
[03:04:20.940 --> 03:04:33.069]  Remember, they're 0 for 5, so the fake news media wants the info warriors to feel like we're the ones being beaten down and get in the bunkers, but there have been five special elections since Trump was elected.
[03:04:33.069 --> 03:04:35.591]  The Democrats have lost all five.
[03:04:35.591 --> 03:04:41.395]  And like you said, they have these bird doggers get in the guy's face, he throws them down, he got elected because he kicked the guy's ass.
[03:04:42.577 --> 03:04:44.619]  Yeah, so they're 0 for 5.
[03:04:44.619 --> 03:04:49.624]  The fake news media is going, oh my god, the Democrats are energized, the base is energized.
[03:04:49.624 --> 03:04:50.625]  No, they're not.
[03:04:50.625 --> 03:04:53.448]  They are completely losing the plot.
[03:04:53.448 --> 03:04:56.571]  The Democrats are dead in the water and Kathy Griffin is a signpost.
[03:04:56.571 --> 03:04:57.612]  She's their tombstone.
[03:04:57.612 --> 03:04:59.114]  We'll be back with Mike Cernovich.
[03:05:01.218 --> 03:05:07.584]  Well folks, it seems like life on the D-list, our decapitation list, isn't what it's all cracked up to be.
[03:05:07.584 --> 03:05:21.356]  You've seen the now infamous images of comedian Kathy Griffin holding up the mock head of Donald Trump, and you've seen the endless news stories of her apologizing, her being called out by the left and right, and losing some of her lucrative paying gigs.
[03:05:21.696 --> 03:05:27.579]  That's right, Kathy Griffin's gonna hold a press conference to complain about bullying from the Trump family.
[03:05:27.579 --> 03:05:29.760]  She should be lucky people are even talking about her.
[03:05:29.760 --> 03:05:32.541]  And now we see the true response of the liberals.
[03:05:33.360 --> 03:05:35.062]  I'm a victim!
[03:05:35.062 --> 03:05:40.166]  During this press conference, they're also going to announce her true motivation behind the photo shoot.
[03:05:40.166 --> 03:05:43.008]  Well, it doesn't really matter what your motivation was, Kathy.
[03:05:43.008 --> 03:05:44.369]  That's a mute point at this time.
[03:05:44.369 --> 03:05:51.995]  Please, for the sake of America, shut your piehole, crawl back into your she-lob lair, and just be happy that tweets are the only thing coming your way.
[03:05:51.995 --> 03:05:55.538]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:05:55.538 --> 03:05:58.821]  And ask yourself, what are you doing to wake up minds?
[03:06:00.939 --> 03:06:15.275]  In America's 240 plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today, fight their hearts out, and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[03:06:15.275 --> 03:06:17.578]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[03:06:18.078 --> 03:06:22.061]  is those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[03:06:22.061 --> 03:06:34.410]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.
[03:06:34.410 --> 03:06:39.254]  We have over a thousand high-quality products available that are discounted at InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:07:00.735 --> 03:07:01.555]  Embrics Essentials.
[03:07:01.555 --> 03:07:02.656]  That's my middle name.
[03:07:02.656 --> 03:07:15.099]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic high quality.
[03:07:15.099 --> 03:07:20.861]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out
[03:07:21.041 --> 03:07:24.245]  High-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[03:07:24.245 --> 03:07:28.871]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[03:07:28.871 --> 03:07:36.000]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:37.162]  It's all there.
[03:07:37.162 --> 03:07:37.863]  The Body Wash.
[03:07:38.123 --> 03:07:42.588]  The shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[03:07:42.588 --> 03:07:53.320]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:07:53.320 --> 03:07:55.942]  Help us win the Info War while getting the products everybody needs.
[03:07:55.942 --> 03:08:00.007]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emrix Essentials.
[03:08:07.877 --> 03:08:21.110]  Here's the deal.
[03:08:21.110 --> 03:08:22.871]  I wasn't brought up a liberal or a conservative.
[03:08:22.871 --> 03:08:26.495]  I was brought up as someone who wanted to live in America and be free.
[03:08:26.495 --> 03:08:28.257]  And I love the animating contests of Liberty.
[03:08:29.150 --> 03:08:32.432]  And now you look at the bullying, terroristic left everywhere.
[03:08:32.432 --> 03:08:37.055]  Every day saying, kill Trump, murder his family, MSNBC analyst.
[03:08:37.055 --> 03:08:37.755]  We ought to play that clip.
[03:08:37.755 --> 03:08:42.398]  I haven't played that in weeks, saying, blow up Trump Towers, ISIS, please.
[03:08:42.398 --> 03:08:47.921]  Let me tell you, you get on national TV and you ask a terrorist organization to hit something, you're now aiding and abetting them.
[03:08:47.921 --> 03:08:50.683]  That's what ISIS does, is use media.
[03:08:50.683 --> 03:08:55.226]  I would be arrested in a day, and I should be, but I don't.
[03:08:56.604 --> 03:09:03.527]  So they flip-flop and twist around how I want violence and how Cernovich wants it.
[03:09:03.527 --> 03:09:07.248]  We're hoping for peace, preparing for war.
[03:09:07.248 --> 03:09:10.830]  And I'm going to get out of here in a second because he's got a guest coming up with a lot to cover.
[03:09:10.830 --> 03:09:16.272]  But Kathy Griffith has come out and said, I'm so happy to deliver beat down to Donald Trump and also to Barron.
[03:09:16.272 --> 03:09:19.333]  You know, a lot of comics are going to go hard for Donald.
[03:09:19.333 --> 03:09:22.715]  My edge is that I'll go direct for Barron and I'm going to get in ahead of the game.
[03:09:23.874 --> 03:09:27.635]  She's got a press conference I'm going to play a few clips of here in just a moment.
[03:09:27.635 --> 03:09:32.376]  But, Mike Cernovich, I don't want to be overconfident.
[03:09:32.376 --> 03:09:33.957]  I agree they're killing themselves politically.
[03:09:33.957 --> 03:09:35.417]  They're falling apart.
[03:09:35.417 --> 03:09:40.899]  New York Times, Fareed Zarkaria, Washington Post, are going, oh we're being too vicious, we should back off.
[03:09:40.899 --> 03:09:47.221]  Only because their own true spirit is discrediting them and they can't help it and they're getting more and more wild.
[03:09:47.901 --> 03:09:52.265]  But I almost like them openly saying they hate America and hate families and love Islam.
[03:09:52.265 --> 03:09:55.087]  At least they're not creeping around behind the scenes doing it.
[03:09:55.087 --> 03:10:07.097]  I don't think they can control themselves because this is losers and existential battle for dominance and primacy when we all know betas trying to be dominant is the greatest train wreck history's ever seen.
[03:10:07.097 --> 03:10:11.421]  So how do you see this bizarre vomitorium moving forward?
[03:10:12.594 --> 03:10:16.296]  Yeah, they show their true colors and their violent nature.
[03:10:16.296 --> 03:10:21.099]  And that is why, again, they've lost every special election that's happened since Trump has been elected.
[03:10:21.099 --> 03:10:25.322]  There's a major revolt against the power elite and they're freaking out.
[03:10:25.322 --> 03:10:26.582]  So you're right.
[03:10:26.582 --> 03:10:35.848]  In a way, though, in a way, I'm not worried about us becoming complacent because the great thing about the media lying about us is people are more fired up than ever.
[03:10:35.848 --> 03:10:37.189]  I mean, think about this for a minute.
[03:10:37.189 --> 03:10:40.911]  Like when the Kathy Griffin thing happened, right away we have a battle plan.
[03:10:41.511 --> 03:10:42.413]  T-shirts!
[03:10:42.413 --> 03:10:43.395]  Contests!
[03:10:43.395 --> 03:10:44.698]  Get people up there!
[03:10:44.698 --> 03:10:45.980]  MSM is terrorism!
[03:10:45.980 --> 03:10:47.583]  Infowars.com!
[03:10:47.583 --> 03:10:52.633]  We have our whole strategy laid out, so whatever the enemy attacks us, and I do think of this as war...
[03:10:53.436 --> 03:10:59.962]  Every time the enemy attacks us now, we know right away how to go into a battle plan because they've been attacking us for so long.
[03:10:59.962 --> 03:11:02.204]  Meanwhile, they don't know how to respond to us.
[03:11:02.204 --> 03:11:03.245]  That's it.
[03:11:03.245 --> 03:11:05.107]  We haven't been on the offense forever.
[03:11:05.107 --> 03:11:07.569]  We're used to being attacked.
[03:11:07.569 --> 03:11:08.590]  They can't stand it.
[03:11:08.590 --> 03:11:10.432]  And the more they attack us, the stronger we get.
[03:11:10.432 --> 03:11:11.133]  They don't know what to do.
[03:11:12.515 --> 03:11:13.356]  Exactly right.
[03:11:13.356 --> 03:11:15.497]  So now we're finally on the offensive.
[03:11:15.497 --> 03:11:23.702]  We said, you know what, because you and me and others, we want free speech, but they all go after us.
[03:11:23.702 --> 03:11:28.465]  So we said, all right, if this is the way you really want to play it, we're going to get Kathy Griffin.
[03:11:29.205 --> 03:11:30.467]  Fired by CNN.
[03:11:30.467 --> 03:11:31.889]  We will make this happen.
[03:11:31.889 --> 03:11:33.392]  This has never been happened.
[03:11:33.392 --> 03:11:37.378]  Nobody in conventional conservative media, they're all trying to take credit for it.
[03:11:37.378 --> 03:11:43.187]  That was an Infowarriors thing, an Alex Jones thing, a Cernovich thing, a social media, all the great people.
[03:11:43.187 --> 03:11:43.728]  What's true is...
[03:11:44.429 --> 03:11:47.650]  That's why the credit again goes to everybody listening.
[03:11:47.650 --> 03:11:49.390]  Everybody picks up the telephone.
[03:11:49.390 --> 03:11:51.511]  Why is CNN hiring a terrorist?
[03:11:51.511 --> 03:11:54.211]  Why do they have somebody who supports ISIS on their show?
[03:11:54.211 --> 03:12:01.493]  If just me or you ranting and raving to the computer or to the radio, it doesn't do anything.
[03:12:01.493 --> 03:12:06.374]  It's the chain reaction of the audience and their passion is an energy source that's unstoppable.
[03:12:07.321 --> 03:12:15.430]  Yeah, Al Franken even pulled out of the Kathy Griffin Show after you and I said we were going to hold a big protest.
[03:12:15.430 --> 03:12:25.160]  I know that you don't like to toot your own horn and this isn't about ego, but what a lot of people don't know is that Al Franken had said, well I don't care, I'm still going to do the event with Kathy Griffin.
[03:12:25.640 --> 03:12:31.682]  So then I tweeted out, all right, we're going to hold a big protest at this event on July 7th.
[03:12:31.682 --> 03:12:35.583]  The very next morning, he said, I don't want anything to do with this.
[03:12:35.583 --> 03:12:38.224]  I can't be with Kathy Griffin anymore.
[03:12:38.224 --> 03:12:40.884]  That was directly because we're going to hold protests.
[03:12:40.884 --> 03:12:42.165]  We're going to show up.
[03:12:42.165 --> 03:12:52.328]  If they want to support ISIS and terrorism against our president and support this death like cult, then now we're going to show up at the protests and they don't know how to react.
[03:12:52.328 --> 03:12:53.268]  So they're running afraid.
[03:12:53.988 --> 03:12:56.570]  I've got a few clips here, the really juicy ones I played earlier.
[03:12:56.570 --> 03:12:58.332]  Did you see in her press conference?
[03:12:58.332 --> 03:13:02.556]  With Allred's daughter, where she sits there and goes, Men write my paychecks!
[03:13:02.556 --> 03:13:03.356]  I've been abused!
[03:13:03.356 --> 03:13:04.697]  He needs to apologize!
[03:13:04.697 --> 03:13:05.438]  It's like Hillary!
[03:13:05.438 --> 03:13:08.601]  And I don't want to bash women, because men do this too today.
[03:13:08.601 --> 03:13:10.422]  But the culture says it's okay for women to do.
[03:13:11.343 --> 03:13:14.444]  It's disgusting where they never take responsibility.
[03:13:14.444 --> 03:13:16.765]  Hillary, you lost because you're a crime family.
[03:13:16.765 --> 03:13:18.105]  You're a pig.
[03:13:18.105 --> 03:13:22.406]  If the Democrats would have run a woman that was actually caring about the people, she would have beat Trump.
[03:13:22.406 --> 03:13:24.727]  Okay, I'll vote for a woman in a minute if she's a patriot.
[03:13:24.727 --> 03:13:26.007]  I supported LePen.
[03:13:26.007 --> 03:13:31.309]  I support, you know, I mean, she's not perfect, but May is better than what we had over in the UK.
[03:13:31.309 --> 03:13:34.970]  Men don't care if it's women in charge, as long as they're doing a good job.
[03:13:34.970 --> 03:13:36.790]  And, and, you know, and, but, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:13:39.890 --> 03:13:47.316]  I was saying, Tulsi Gabbard, if she had won, if the Democrats had run Tulsi Gabbard, that would have been a very scary election for the Trump people.
[03:13:47.316 --> 03:13:48.557]  So, you're right.
[03:13:48.557 --> 03:13:53.782]  I know a lot of men who are hoping Tulsi Gabbard will run, but then the Clintons are trying to keep her up.
[03:13:53.782 --> 03:13:54.302]  Exactly.
[03:13:54.302 --> 03:13:55.743]  It's a no-brainer.
[03:13:55.743 --> 03:13:58.306]  When I look at a candidate, I care about the track record, what they do.
[03:13:58.306 --> 03:13:59.567]  I don't look, are they brown?
[03:13:59.567 --> 03:14:00.467]  Are they black?
[03:14:00.467 --> 03:14:01.008]  Are they a man?
[03:14:01.008 --> 03:14:01.548]  Are they a woman?
[03:14:01.548 --> 03:14:03.290]  I look, are they for freedom?
[03:14:03.290 --> 03:14:06.673]  And I'm so sick of the left claiming we're obsessed with what color somebody is, or
[03:14:07.253 --> 03:14:08.414]  What's between their legs?
[03:14:08.414 --> 03:14:09.855]  I care about action.
[03:14:09.855 --> 03:14:16.360]  But getting back to the media, there is this thing where women are supposedly allowed to call for violence, whatever they want, and then get away with it.
[03:14:16.360 --> 03:14:22.524]  So they want the feminist deal where they can run around and be violent, but then have the chivalry where we don't then say you're in a man's world.
[03:14:22.524 --> 03:14:23.125]  No.
[03:14:23.125 --> 03:14:27.908]  Hillary is now on this new tour of blaming everybody but herself.
[03:14:27.908 --> 03:14:28.449]  What do you make of that?
[03:14:29.557 --> 03:14:31.839]  Yeah, and that's been a problem for a long time.
[03:14:31.839 --> 03:14:33.521]  They call them cry bullies.
[03:14:33.521 --> 03:14:41.308]  Ben Garrison actually did a really hilarious cartoon of it, where they'll come out and attack you, and then when you defend yourself, they cry.
[03:14:41.308 --> 03:14:43.850]  Oh my God, I can't believe we're being attacked, we're being attacked.
[03:14:43.850 --> 03:14:48.174]  So, Kathy Griffin created an ISIS terrorist message.
[03:14:48.174 --> 03:14:49.595]  That was a call to violence.
[03:14:49.595 --> 03:14:53.639]  That was a direct call of violence to all the people in ISIS who support Hollywood.
[03:14:54.339 --> 03:15:06.148]  And then when we fight back and get her fired from CNN, her shows have been canceled, she's been kicked out of many venues, her career is... and we're still fighting after what she did today.
[03:15:06.148 --> 03:15:13.353]  I talked to a bunch of my people and I go, okay, you know, I think, I think if Kathy Griffin issues an apology video to Barron, then we'll back off.
[03:15:14.068 --> 03:15:26.211]  But when she came on to video today and said she's going to keep attacking Barron and that she thinks it's funny to attack 11-year-old children, I realized that could be my children or your children or anybody listening, their children.
[03:15:26.211 --> 03:15:28.432]  So we're actually going to attack even more.
[03:15:28.432 --> 03:15:29.312]  And we know what it is.
[03:15:29.312 --> 03:15:31.553]  They're doing it to threaten and mess with the family.
[03:15:32.373 --> 03:15:41.818]  And don't they get when you mess, it shows how disconnected they are, when you mess with people's kids, dumbass, the reason people don't do that is because they mean no truce has ever happened after that.
[03:15:41.818 --> 03:15:48.642]  The reason mafias don't kill kids is because then they know the other side never gives up and never makes a deal, dumbass.
[03:15:48.642 --> 03:15:49.683]  Doesn't she understand now?
[03:15:49.683 --> 03:15:53.685]  She's made the president a personal enemy and she better watch her ass.
[03:15:53.685 --> 03:15:55.386]  I wouldn't blame Trump if he did anything to her now.
[03:15:56.340 --> 03:15:58.681]  Well, and she's made more important, like Don Jr.
[03:15:58.681 --> 03:15:59.782]  is not letting up.
[03:15:59.782 --> 03:16:02.143]  Don Jr., I've never seen him this fired up.
[03:16:02.143 --> 03:16:12.449]  So in a way, because I remember you and I, we had this conversation and I said, you know, I'm glad from our perspective that the media has gone after Trump as bad as they are.
[03:16:12.449 --> 03:16:14.450]  And he said, well, why is that, Cernovich?
[03:16:14.450 --> 03:16:14.910]  And I said,
[03:16:15.390 --> 03:16:19.473]  Well, because now Trump realizes who has his back.
[03:16:19.473 --> 03:16:23.656]  And it's the Infowarriors, it's you, me, it's the people, you know, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:16:23.656 --> 03:16:27.238]  It's not about us getting credit, he goes more hardcore with our worldview now.
[03:16:27.238 --> 03:16:31.241]  He understands Trump is already a patriot and he realizes they're not going to compromise with me.
[03:16:31.241 --> 03:16:33.202]  I'm going to go hardcore with the real patriots.
[03:16:33.202 --> 03:16:34.724]  He now is going to be who he really is.
[03:16:35.584 --> 03:16:50.228]  Exactly, that's why they pull out of the Paris Accord, is he realized, well wait a minute, every time I listen to globalist Gary or Dina Habib Powell, or these Goldman Sachs people, all I do is my own base I alienate, and the liberals aren't going to like me anyway.
[03:16:50.228 --> 03:16:54.950]  And that's why Bannon's back, what I heard is Bannon's back in the catbird seat, and that's why they're flipping out, is that true?
[03:16:56.075 --> 03:17:02.800]  Well, we want to be very careful of what we say about Bannon, because if Bannon gets too much attention, that can cause a little bit of drama.
[03:17:02.800 --> 03:17:09.604]  But let's just say Bannon is laying low, but the Patriots should be very happy knowing that good things are happening.
[03:17:09.604 --> 03:17:12.166]  Which is what you said three weeks ago, and what my sources said.
[03:17:12.166 --> 03:17:13.887]  The gloves are coming off, and we just saw it.
[03:17:15.111 --> 03:17:15.532]  Exactly.
[03:17:15.532 --> 03:17:21.257]  And that was why Trump pulled out of the Paris Accord is he realized, okay, the media, they're going to go after my children.
[03:17:21.257 --> 03:17:22.819]  They hate me anyway.
[03:17:22.819 --> 03:17:24.541]  I might as well hate them back.
[03:17:24.541 --> 03:17:29.726]  And I might as well do what the Patriots want me to do and fight for the people who actually got them elected.
[03:17:30.306 --> 03:17:41.712]  So it's a beautiful thing, and going after Barron again, the Kathy Griffin thing today was, from my perspective, I'm glad she did it, because that shows the true face of modern liberalism.
[03:17:41.712 --> 03:17:51.457]  They'll go after children, they don't blame ISIS, they love to be violent, and they whine and bitch like they're victims in the middle of the display.
[03:17:52.688 --> 03:18:01.293]  Exactly, and then they're emotionally erratic, so she's... One minute laughing, one minute crying.
[03:18:01.293 --> 03:18:02.254]  That's like a toddler.
[03:18:02.254 --> 03:18:08.677]  That's what, you know, my six-month-old daughter will do, is one minute she's giggling and then crying, and then it's like a cry-giggle.
[03:18:08.677 --> 03:18:09.598]  You know, you're a parent.
[03:18:09.598 --> 03:18:10.698]  Yes.
[03:18:10.698 --> 03:18:10.919]  Right?
[03:18:10.919 --> 03:18:16.122]  That's Kathy Griffin, a 56-year-old infant.
[03:18:16.122 --> 03:18:17.843]  Man, I tell you, she's crazy.
[03:18:17.843 --> 03:18:21.765]  I've played a bunch of these clips, but here's some of the other clips from the Kathy Griffin press conference.
[03:18:25.382 --> 03:18:26.604]  No, cut the crap.
[03:18:26.604 --> 03:18:27.946]  This wouldn't be happening to a guy.
[03:18:27.946 --> 03:18:29.168]  This is a woman thing, alright?
[03:18:29.168 --> 03:18:30.570]  I'm just gonna come out and say it.
[03:18:30.570 --> 03:18:32.954]  I'm sorry if you don't agree with me, but I live it.
[03:18:32.954 --> 03:18:34.876]  I'm 56 years old.
[03:18:34.876 --> 03:18:38.281]  Everywhere I play, there's a male promoter, there's a male who owns the theater.
[03:18:38.281 --> 03:18:40.024]  The people who sign my checks are white guys.
[03:18:41.596 --> 03:18:42.618]  Yeah, I've said that in my act.
[03:18:57.738 --> 03:18:59.619]  Yes, years ago.
[03:18:59.619 --> 03:19:01.379]  So you admitted you're going after Barron Trump.
[03:19:01.379 --> 03:19:02.999]  Is that what this is all about?
[03:19:02.999 --> 03:19:05.680]  I think a comic should be able to make fun of everybody.
[03:19:05.680 --> 03:19:08.341]  I apologize, my question is for Lisa.
[03:19:08.341 --> 03:19:10.561]  Are you aware that your client is trying to go after Barron Trump?
[03:19:10.561 --> 03:19:12.902]  Okay, so that's a ridiculous, misleading question.
[03:19:12.902 --> 03:19:15.723]  She hasn't said a single word here today about Barron Trump.
[03:19:15.723 --> 03:19:17.783]  She was talking about something from a comedy act from years ago.
[03:19:17.783 --> 03:19:20.044]  She's playing the part of a... No, it was last year, six months ago.
[03:19:20.044 --> 03:19:23.444]  Let me talk about this issue of children, okay?
[03:19:23.444 --> 03:19:25.545]  We can have edgy comics in America.
[03:19:25.925 --> 03:19:28.966]  Comics can say things that are not appropriate for children.
[03:19:28.966 --> 03:19:32.448]  Comics can create images that are not appropriate for children.
[03:19:32.448 --> 03:19:35.729]  Many things on the news are not appropriate for children.
[03:19:35.729 --> 03:19:40.111]  I'm a parent of two adult children and a teenage foster son.
[03:19:40.111 --> 03:19:45.373]  It is my job as a parent to filter out what is appropriate for my children.
[03:19:45.373 --> 03:19:49.475]  It is not the job of a comic to filter everything down to the left.
[03:19:49.475 --> 03:19:51.275]  Yeah, the left gets all their speech but nobody else does.
[03:19:51.275 --> 03:19:54.697]  She gets to make the comedy and the art that she wants to make
[03:19:55.397 --> 03:19:59.260]  Can we go back to the clip I played earlier today, where she totally cries?
[03:19:59.260 --> 03:20:04.424]  Trump can block out every news organization tweeting out this photo.
[03:20:04.424 --> 03:20:04.905]  You know what?
[03:20:04.905 --> 03:20:12.911]  There's a lot of disgusting stuff about Trump on the news every day, like the fact that he's making us the laughing stock of the world.
[03:20:12.911 --> 03:20:14.892]  He's making us the laughing stock.
[03:20:14.892 --> 03:20:20.657]  These are pathetic slugs, going knowing the corporate media wants to destroy Trump, throwing themselves.
[03:20:21.718 --> 03:20:24.941]  On the altar of the system hoping the system gives them attention.
[03:20:24.941 --> 03:20:29.045]  They don't get they came a dollar day You know a dollar short a day late.
[03:20:29.045 --> 03:20:36.213]  I mean they're here just to see these two narcissistic You know bubble bees up there on TV.
[03:20:36.213 --> 03:20:39.837]  Just hoping for attention and all they're getting is their own destruction Mike
[03:20:40.891 --> 03:20:44.553]  Oh, and that's why I'm glad, and that's again why I support free speech.
[03:20:44.553 --> 03:21:02.583]  I'm glad they did that because I want the whole country to look at least... five years ago... I want that nasty attitude, that terrible attitude of the typical Hillary Clinton supporter where they can't talk in a civilized manner, they can't... Why are they so arrogant?
[03:21:02.583 --> 03:21:04.564]  Why are they... because they are so arrogant.
[03:21:06.010 --> 03:21:11.473]  Because they've had their boot on the necks of America for 20 years.
[03:21:11.473 --> 03:21:13.054]  You know what it's like.
[03:21:13.054 --> 03:21:15.435]  We can't go out anywhere in public without security.
[03:21:15.435 --> 03:21:23.539]  If you and I want to have a meetup and just meet people and talk to people, we have to have third party security there because that is how the violent the left is.
[03:21:23.539 --> 03:21:25.240]  And they thought that they had us beat down.
[03:21:25.840 --> 03:21:32.769]  Not realizing that made us realize this is a fight for our life, for our children's lives, and we're going to fight that much harder.
[03:21:32.769 --> 03:21:34.672]  Now Trump realizes it too.
[03:21:34.672 --> 03:21:36.734]  They literally want to murder him.
[03:21:36.734 --> 03:21:39.277]  Kathy Griffin literally wants to murder Barron Trump.
[03:21:39.277 --> 03:21:41.140]  That is modern liberalism today.
[03:21:42.270 --> 03:21:45.971]  Well they certainly demonize him.
[03:21:45.971 --> 03:21:47.652]  I don't know why they went for Kathy Griffin quite frankly.
[03:21:47.652 --> 03:21:51.193]  She just has the bloody head and looks like ISIS type of thing.
[03:21:51.193 --> 03:21:53.313]  What about all the other clips?
[03:21:53.313 --> 03:21:58.275]  You've seen it where CNBC, MSNBC hosts say, please blow up his Trump Towers, ISIS.
[03:21:58.275 --> 03:22:02.456]  And reporters, LA Times, New York Times all say, let's kill Trump.
[03:22:02.456 --> 03:22:03.437]  I'm going to murder Trump.
[03:22:03.437 --> 03:22:04.657]  I mean they're organizing it.
[03:22:06.104 --> 03:22:17.852]  Yeah, actually a counterterrorism specialist, who, there he is, Malcolm Nance, he actually said that, yeah, I think let's have a contest on which Trump Hotel will be the first terrorist attack thing.
[03:22:17.852 --> 03:22:19.693]  Ha ha ha, isn't that funny?
[03:22:19.693 --> 03:22:22.375]  Terrorism, innocent people die, innocent people murdered.
[03:22:22.375 --> 03:22:25.957]  That is what the, that's why the contest going on right now.
[03:22:26.781 --> 03:22:29.122]  The real play isn't Kathy Griffin.
[03:22:29.122 --> 03:22:35.665]  The real play is for people to get those t-shirts and get on camera and say, MSM is terrorism.
[03:22:35.665 --> 03:22:38.107]  Infowars.com is the truth.
[03:22:38.107 --> 03:22:40.188]  The media are the terrorists.
[03:22:40.188 --> 03:22:41.648]  The media is ISIS.
[03:22:41.648 --> 03:22:42.669]  CNN is ISIS.
[03:22:42.669 --> 03:22:44.430]  That's why people got to grab those shirts, which
[03:22:44.890 --> 03:22:47.092]  You know, there's no real money in that.
[03:22:47.092 --> 03:22:48.573]  Those are discounted already.
[03:22:48.573 --> 03:22:50.535]  And you can make your own poster, make your own design.
[03:22:50.535 --> 03:22:51.136]  We have the MP3s.
[03:22:51.136 --> 03:22:57.301]  In fact, you had the idea a few days ago, that night it happened, I guess Tuesday night or whatever it was, Wednesday night, to do the contest, so I did it.
[03:22:57.301 --> 03:23:00.984]  But I think beyond Kathy Griffin saying, you know, CNN terrorist, I agree.
[03:23:00.984 --> 03:23:03.587]  And I've already got new T-shirts coming out and new MP, not MP3s, new JPEGs.
[03:23:06.349 --> 03:23:13.511]  Just saying, MSM is terrorism, or CNN, fake news show.
[03:23:13.511 --> 03:23:17.113]  The content is fake news, MSM is terrorism, MSM is the enemy.
[03:23:17.113 --> 03:23:19.694]  As Trump says, MSM is the enemy of America.
[03:23:19.694 --> 03:23:23.455]  So, MSM is the enemy of America, InfoWars.com, $1,000.
[03:23:23.455 --> 03:23:27.156]  Get it on TV, national TV, get the audio out repeatedly, $2,500.
[03:23:27.156 --> 03:23:29.037]  I want to pay this money out, folks.
[03:23:29.037 --> 03:23:32.358]  But it isn't about the money, it's about the fun of the first... You know what?
[03:23:33.238 --> 03:23:37.981]  I think I'm going to say this right now just to make it... It may have already happened because I've got a limited crew checking the emails and stuff.
[03:23:37.981 --> 03:23:40.222]  Because last time it took three or four days to do it.
[03:23:40.222 --> 03:23:43.483]  Has somebody done this yet on national TV, Cernovich?
[03:23:43.483 --> 03:23:46.405]  I haven't heard yet either and that's good.
[03:23:46.405 --> 03:23:51.867]  Maybe the first person who does it, as of right now, 3.23 p.m.
[03:23:51.867 --> 03:23:56.050]  Eastern Standard Time, maybe double the prize for the first person who does it.
[03:23:56.050 --> 03:23:56.510]  No, no, no.
[03:23:56.510 --> 03:23:56.730]  It's $10,000.
[03:23:56.730 --> 03:23:56.790]  Wow.
[03:24:00.230 --> 03:24:01.091]  We're on the same page.
[03:24:01.091 --> 03:24:03.613]  We must trigger the chain reaction.
[03:24:03.613 --> 03:24:12.860]  The first person that gets MSM is fake news, enemy of America, Infowars.com out, with audio, gets $10,000.
[03:24:12.860 --> 03:24:17.544]  First person to do it just with one of these Kathy Griffin is a terrorist, MSM is a terrorist.
[03:24:18.064 --> 03:24:20.847]  Infowars.com, Real News, whatever, it's a thousand.
[03:24:20.847 --> 03:24:21.969]  It isn't about the money.
[03:24:21.969 --> 03:24:28.856]  It's about taking action, getting off the bench, and folks, you can get on local news, it'll end up being on national news, and then that counts.
[03:24:28.856 --> 03:24:32.120]  I paid out a bunch of those where you hit local news, look how...
[03:24:33.061 --> 03:24:35.582]  There's probably a billion views online.
[03:24:35.582 --> 03:24:38.883]  The first, you know, reporter out there on a live feed doesn't know he's live.
[03:24:38.883 --> 03:24:41.784]  He says, I don't care if she's 20, you know, I'd such-and-such write her such-and-such.
[03:24:41.784 --> 03:24:44.245]  Now that's crude, you don't like it, whatever, I wouldn't do it.
[03:24:44.245 --> 03:24:46.285]  He got fired, though, didn't know he's live.
[03:24:46.285 --> 03:25:01.110]  So a local comedian got mad, did it twice on live TV, now it's happening all over the world, billions of views for something that's funny, but it doesn't do anything to say, you know what, yeah, there was a flood here today and I was worried about it and saw the wreckage flying by, that's why.
[03:25:02.743 --> 03:25:04.124]  That doesn't matter.
[03:25:04.124 --> 03:25:17.514]  Saying Bill Clinton's a rapist, saying Trump's a hero, fake news is the enemy of America, Kathy Griffin is terrorizing America, Infowars.com, that affects chains and shakes them up and it's a chain reaction.
[03:25:17.514 --> 03:25:23.198]  It's about getting the public to realize the power you have to take action.
[03:25:23.198 --> 03:25:24.499]  Mike Cernovich.
[03:25:24.499 --> 03:25:27.481]  No, exactly right, and it's a show of force.
[03:25:27.481 --> 03:25:30.584]  Ultimately, what we have- That's it, it's a show of force.
[03:25:31.385 --> 03:25:31.986]  Right.
[03:25:31.986 --> 03:25:34.728]  We need to show people we're going to come to your events.
[03:25:34.728 --> 03:25:36.470]  The people do support us.
[03:25:36.470 --> 03:25:38.812]  This isn't a passive audience that's just sitting around.
[03:25:38.812 --> 03:25:39.652]  You want to bully us?
[03:25:39.652 --> 03:25:41.434]  You want to terrorize us in the street with our kids?
[03:25:41.434 --> 03:25:42.415]  Hey, that's your issue.
[03:25:42.415 --> 03:25:46.799]  We're going to go legally and lawfully to outdoor live events and we're going to peacefully take it over.
[03:25:46.799 --> 03:25:48.320]  We're going to go to your live Democratic mics.
[03:25:48.320 --> 03:25:49.941]  We're going to go to your comedy clubs.
[03:25:49.941 --> 03:25:53.785]  We are going to stand back up against you at the hour and time of our choosing.
[03:25:55.129 --> 03:25:56.071]  Exactly.
[03:25:56.071 --> 03:25:58.975]  And wow, $10,000 is amazing.
[03:25:58.975 --> 03:26:01.018]  That is an amazing award.
[03:26:01.018 --> 03:26:02.420]  That'll get things popping.
[03:26:02.420 --> 03:26:04.683]  And that is a very powerful show for us.
[03:26:04.683 --> 03:26:08.409]  And also to let people know you're not going to bully us, you're not going to silence us.
[03:26:08.409 --> 03:26:11.213]  All these people coming after you every day, beleaguered every day.
[03:26:11.673 --> 03:26:14.016]  Every day they're lying about us, fabricating us.
[03:26:14.016 --> 03:26:18.220]  George Soros, they monitor everything that we say or do, which is kind of funny.
[03:26:18.220 --> 03:26:20.302]  It's kind of like why I like doing the show with you.
[03:26:20.302 --> 03:26:34.737]  I like doing it by myself, but with you it's funny because then the Soros people transcribe the entire thing, and then five minutes later Media Matters is going, oh my god, you know, here's what they talked about today, these terrible people, even though we really are... Did you see where Maxine Waters went?
[03:26:35.157 --> 03:26:36.297]  This is not an edited quote.
[03:26:36.297 --> 03:26:37.818]  She said, it's horrible.
[03:26:37.818 --> 03:26:41.459]  They go, they have American flags, they're happy, they're cheering.
[03:26:41.459 --> 03:26:42.399]  We can't allow this.
[03:26:42.399 --> 03:26:43.180]  This is extreme.
[03:26:43.180 --> 03:26:43.780]  This is bad.
[03:26:43.780 --> 03:26:46.901]  And the reporter goes, it's bad to have American flags and be happy?
[03:26:46.901 --> 03:26:47.621]  She goes, yes.
[03:26:47.621 --> 03:26:49.982]  I mean, you talk about a loon bat, man.
[03:26:49.982 --> 03:26:52.543]  She doesn't want us to have American flags and be happy?
[03:26:52.543 --> 03:26:55.904]  Well, we've all gone to protests.
[03:26:55.904 --> 03:26:58.565]  You never see an American flag and Democrat event.
[03:26:59.218 --> 03:27:01.339]  You never see, they burn them, unless they're burning them.
[03:27:01.339 --> 03:27:04.920]  You see the one with Merkel where somebody had a German flag and she grabbed it like it was dirty?
[03:27:04.920 --> 03:27:06.621]  Yeah, she, that was the best video ever.
[03:27:06.621 --> 03:27:08.961]  Yeah, so she, somebody tried to bring a German flag.
[03:27:08.961 --> 03:27:10.602]  So go watch his tweets if you want to find it, guys.
[03:27:10.602 --> 03:27:11.702]  Go ahead, sorry.
[03:27:11.702 --> 03:27:16.364]  Yeah, she grabbed it and threw it away and said, no, no, you can't do this, we're globalists.
[03:27:16.364 --> 03:27:24.847]  Oh, and speaking of which, did you see where the EU president tried to tell Trump that he couldn't leave the Paris Agreement a couple days before he did?
[03:27:24.847 --> 03:27:27.968]  And they're so snide and he goes, I tried to explain to Trump
[03:27:28.468 --> 03:27:32.672]  Yeah, that's Juncker, the unelected dictator of the EU, threatening our president.
[03:27:32.672 --> 03:27:33.693]  It's like, who could...
[03:27:45.270 --> 03:27:48.091]  Who could make up, like everybody says Nazi this, Nazi that.
[03:27:48.091 --> 03:27:53.114]  Juncker is literally the heir to the Nazi stolen fortune of Luxembourg.
[03:27:53.114 --> 03:27:55.315]  I mean, out of a movie.
[03:27:55.315 --> 03:28:00.218]  So we got Trump hugging the American flag, we have Merkel seizing the German flag and grabs it and drags it away.
[03:28:01.650 --> 03:28:03.351]  Yeah, they hate America.
[03:28:03.351 --> 03:28:14.235]  And speaking of which, this is a little bit related to is that Turkish basketball player, his dad was just arrested by Turkish thugs in Turkey.
[03:28:14.235 --> 03:28:16.776]  And if you think about it, there's no freedom in Turkey.
[03:28:17.396 --> 03:28:24.958]  But the globalists wanted us, the Americans, to go to war with Russia to defend NATO-allied Turkey.
[03:28:24.958 --> 03:28:26.239]  I mean, can you believe it?
[03:28:26.239 --> 03:28:27.959]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:28:27.959 --> 03:28:30.640]  Father Turkey's star detained in the investigation.
[03:28:30.640 --> 03:28:37.762]  And the globalists are telling us that in America we have a treaty obligation to defend Turkey if Russia ever goes into Turkey.
[03:28:37.762 --> 03:28:39.683]  And you think, who are these sick people?
[03:28:41.448 --> 03:28:44.469]  Well, Mike Cernovich, I want you to take over after this break.
[03:28:44.469 --> 03:28:47.531]  If you want to play the club, I've got her crying, all the fake crying, but I know you've got a guest coming up.
[03:28:47.531 --> 03:28:49.091]  She can cover that if you want, but great job, my friend.
[03:28:49.091 --> 03:28:50.552]  Can't wait until you're on five days a week.
[03:28:50.552 --> 03:28:52.032]  The next month and a half, I'm going to get that set up.
[03:28:52.032 --> 03:28:53.033]  So I'm working on that today.
[03:28:53.033 --> 03:28:54.353]  Thank you, Mike Cernovich.
[03:28:54.353 --> 03:28:57.935]  Briefly, we're under attack in more ways than one.
[03:28:57.935 --> 03:28:58.955]  I'm not complaining.

[03:29:44.930 --> 03:29:49.792]  Mike Cernovich, the Raging Bull of Liberty, straight ahead.
[03:29:49.792 --> 03:29:51.192]  We're on the march.
[03:29:51.192 --> 03:29:53.714]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.714 --> 03:29:56.415]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.553 --> 03:30:10.359]  Remember when we used to say, if you think the liberals hate Donald Trump now, just wait until he delivers on his campaign promises.
[03:30:10.359 --> 03:30:11.399]  Well, guess what?
[03:30:11.399 --> 03:30:15.602]  It's happening and the liberals are losing their freaking minds.
[03:30:15.602 --> 03:30:20.065]  What could be defined and construed as a dark speech.
[03:30:20.065 --> 03:30:24.007]  This will be the day that the United States resigned as the leader of the free world.
[03:30:24.007 --> 03:30:26.049]  I have such rage and sadness.
[03:30:26.049 --> 03:30:29.511]  We just watched a dangerous little man give a very, very scary speech.
[03:30:29.551 --> 03:30:33.174]  Michael Moore called it a crime against humanity.
[03:30:33.174 --> 03:30:36.416]  And Bette Midler tweeted that there has never in U.S.
[03:30:36.416 --> 03:30:42.100]  history been such a destructive and megalomaniac in the White House as Donald Trump.
[03:30:42.100 --> 03:30:44.542]  Newsflash to liberals.
[03:30:44.542 --> 03:30:50.446]  60 million plus Americans voted for Trump because of his campaign promises.
[03:30:50.446 --> 03:30:52.647]  And the president is delivering.
[03:30:52.647 --> 03:30:56.230]  Based on real science and done with an America first
[03:30:56.670 --> 03:30:57.271]  Attitude.
[03:30:57.271 --> 03:31:01.474]  You can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[03:31:01.474 --> 03:31:11.683]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[03:31:11.863 --> 03:31:18.970]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:31:18.970 --> 03:31:23.854]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:31:23.854 --> 03:31:29.900]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowars Lite.
[03:31:30.640 --> 03:31:37.803]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:31:37.803 --> 03:31:44.825]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:31:44.825 --> 03:31:49.307]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:31:49.307 --> 03:31:52.528]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:31:52.708 --> 03:31:58.989]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:31:58.989 --> 03:32:01.450]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:01.450 --> 03:32:12.053]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:32:12.053 --> 03:32:13.873]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[03:32:14.113 --> 03:32:16.975]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[03:32:16.975 --> 03:32:18.455]  It's made in the USA.
[03:32:18.455 --> 03:32:25.279]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:32:25.279 --> 03:32:27.380]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:32:27.380 --> 03:32:37.085]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:32:37.085 --> 03:32:42.068]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[03:32:42.168 --> 03:32:53.898]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those rush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:32:53.898 --> 03:32:57.181]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:32:57.181 --> 03:33:00.323]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:33:16.400 --> 03:33:19.083]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:19.083 --> 03:33:27.771]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:33:27.771 --> 03:33:30.193]  And we're back, Mike Sturmisch hosting SportsHour.
[03:33:33.289 --> 03:33:38.694]  Just go to twitter.com forward slash C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H.
[03:33:38.694 --> 03:33:41.097]  Twitter forward slash Cernovich.
[03:33:41.097 --> 03:33:45.561]  Today we're going to cover a story that the MSM does not want you to hear about.
[03:33:45.561 --> 03:33:48.203]  They do not want you to know about.
[03:33:48.203 --> 03:33:50.906]  The story is about the Awan brothers.
[03:33:50.906 --> 03:33:51.747]  They had...
[03:33:52.427 --> 03:33:55.369]  Higher level security than Seth Rich had actually.
[03:33:55.369 --> 03:34:03.773]  They were the IT directors for the Democrats, for Deborah Wasserman Schultz and for the entire Democrat Congress.
[03:34:03.773 --> 03:34:10.636]  In that capacity, they had access to all of the emails sent to and from Congress.
[03:34:10.636 --> 03:34:13.178]  This should be a headline story.
[03:34:13.178 --> 03:34:15.099]  We always talk about collusion.
[03:34:15.099 --> 03:34:17.800]  We always talk about foreign influence in the fake news media.
[03:34:17.800 --> 03:34:21.742]  They're always talking about what are these foreign governments trying to do?
[03:34:22.611 --> 03:34:29.733]  Well, there are actually two people with the highest level privileges and access to every email.
[03:34:29.733 --> 03:34:31.673]  They're with Awan Brothers.
[03:34:31.673 --> 03:34:33.634]  Major national security threat.
[03:34:33.634 --> 03:34:36.354]  Major, major terrorist threat.
[03:34:36.354 --> 03:34:38.935]  They had connections to terrorist organizations.
[03:34:38.935 --> 03:34:43.116]  The Democrats are trying to obstruct justice and trying to shut it down.
[03:34:43.877 --> 03:34:50.380]  So we have brought on a special guest today, George Webb, who has been following this story very closely.
[03:34:50.380 --> 03:34:58.625]  So, George, I'll just say hello to you and then let you kind of talk about the Yewan Brothers story and tell us what you've been finding.
[03:34:58.625 --> 03:34:58.885]  Sure.
[03:34:58.885 --> 03:35:03.727]  Well, it's like Whitmore to Bernstein now with the song.
[03:35:03.727 --> 03:35:08.830]  I'm George Webb and this is Jason Goodman of Crowdsource The Truth.
[03:35:08.830 --> 03:35:09.771]  So you got both of us.
[03:35:09.771 --> 03:35:11.932]  Two for one, Mike.
[03:35:11.932 --> 03:35:12.112]  Right.
[03:35:12.876 --> 03:35:15.498]  So, the Wan Brothers is a simple story.
[03:35:15.498 --> 03:35:19.441]  It's basically Debbie Wasserman Schultz running a spy ring in Congress.
[03:35:21.614 --> 03:35:36.877]  Now, the interesting reporting that we do with going out on the Internet is we get people to search with us and for us, and then I am kind of a stenographer, and push back the intelligence out to people for more detailed searches.
[03:35:36.877 --> 03:35:43.098]  We just kind of go down in the level, you know, we start at 30,000 feet, we bring it in for a landing on every topic.
[03:35:43.098 --> 03:35:45.899]  Crowdsourced to Truth is a discussion area where we
[03:35:46.616 --> 03:35:50.838]  Discuss those, and we weigh that, kind of like weighing the evidence sort of thing.
[03:35:50.838 --> 03:36:09.865]  So everything we take in, we go through a vetting process on CrowdSource The Truth, and I'm out there basically collecting, and Jason's running the New York studio here in Chelsea, and the things that we found beyond these daily caller stories, Luke Rosiak's done great reporting on these four
[03:36:10.672 --> 03:36:17.414]  Well, there's going to be six in total Awans, if you count wives.
[03:36:17.414 --> 03:36:21.075]  Let me interrupt you for a second, my good friend.
[03:36:21.075 --> 03:36:23.956]  When you say Deborah Wasserman, we need to take a big step back.
[03:36:23.956 --> 03:36:32.359]  When you say Deborah Wasserman Schultz was running a spy ring in Congress, that is not the kind of thing we just say and move on.
[03:36:32.359 --> 03:36:34.460]  That is a nuclear direct
[03:36:35.251 --> 03:36:37.234]  Truth bomb, if it is true.
[03:36:37.234 --> 03:36:40.459]  So let's go back to what you initially said.
[03:36:40.459 --> 03:36:43.924]  You claimed that Deborah Wasserman Schultz was running a spy ring in Congress.
[03:36:43.924 --> 03:36:46.148]  So what evidence do we have to support that?
[03:36:47.225 --> 03:36:56.307]  Well, our best evidence comes from James Comey himself, saying that the mechanism, that how it's done is with a BlackBerry syncing to a laptop.
[03:36:56.307 --> 03:37:00.608]  And this is how Huma got her emails to Anthony Weider's laptop.
[03:37:00.608 --> 03:37:08.449]  So all they did is just reproduce that for, let's see, about 80 to 150 members of Congress, and we don't really know how many.
[03:37:08.449 --> 03:37:16.031]  Now the other part of this that people are going to find maybe either funny or surprising is Anthony Weider,
[03:37:16.684 --> 03:37:16.804]  Well,
[03:37:31.767 --> 03:37:36.369]  I believe that to be true, but what evidence do we have, I guess, would be my claim.
[03:37:36.369 --> 03:37:46.632]  So there's a lot of people keep in mind when we say the Awan Brothers, as you know, if Trump tweets a typo on Twitter, that is on every cable news station in the world.
[03:37:46.632 --> 03:37:49.933]  But there are a lot of people watching and listening are saying, well, wait a minute.
[03:37:49.933 --> 03:37:51.994]  I've never heard of the Awan Brothers.
[03:37:51.994 --> 03:37:53.034]  What is that even about?
[03:37:53.934 --> 03:38:03.925]  Okay, so there are six people that are employed in the Congress, all making $160,000 or in that neighborhood, which is right at the top end of Congress.
[03:38:03.925 --> 03:38:09.411]  You can go to InsideGov right now and look up, search for the name Awan, and you'll see the six names.
[03:38:09.411 --> 03:38:10.593]  Now, two of them are wives.
[03:38:11.193 --> 03:38:17.278]  So, it's Hina Alvi, A-L-V-I, or you can look up Natalia Sova, S-O-V-A.
[03:38:17.278 --> 03:38:18.319]  Okay?
[03:38:18.319 --> 03:38:23.863]  Now, the Truth Pundit has reported the burglaries that the Awan brothers did, the 20 different burglaries they did.
[03:38:23.863 --> 03:38:32.129]  And the New York Post has also reported on this, as well as I mentioned Wayne Rosiak, a particular caller.
[03:38:32.129 --> 03:38:35.232]  Marita Bartoloma at Fox had this.
[03:38:35.232 --> 03:38:36.773]  Varney had it.
[03:38:36.773 --> 03:38:39.055]  Let's see, a couple of the, Dobbs, I think, had it.
[03:38:39.679 --> 03:38:48.684]  What we've done is basically gone forward from there with in-depth searches and found out different companies they've worked for in Congress.
[03:38:48.684 --> 03:38:50.305]  I've developed sources in the Congress.
[03:38:50.305 --> 03:38:54.327]  I know you're a White House Correspondent now, Mike, so congratulations on that.
[03:38:57.819 --> 03:39:05.543]  I'm not going to say a mole in Congress, but I've been given a lot of information that Imran worked for a company called Inter-American.
[03:39:05.543 --> 03:39:11.587]  The CIA wink there is Enter-America, but I'll cover that later with my audience.
[03:39:11.587 --> 03:39:13.508]  But basically through visas,
[03:39:14.188 --> 03:39:15.188]  We're good.
[03:39:29.953 --> 03:39:34.337]  Jason and I were there at least seven days talking to everybody.
[03:39:34.337 --> 03:39:38.080]  Jason had an ambush interview with Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[03:39:38.080 --> 03:39:40.402]  She didn't know who the Warren Brothers was.
[03:39:40.402 --> 03:39:41.143]  Apparently not.
[03:39:41.143 --> 03:39:42.524]  She didn't have much to say about it.
[03:39:42.524 --> 03:39:51.051]  But you know, the other thing that, Mike, you're asking about evidence, I think certainly Debbie Wasserman Schultz's own behavior is an indicator that this is a serious issue.
[03:39:51.051 --> 03:39:54.034]  We saw in the news, in her own words, there's video of her
[03:39:54.674 --> 03:40:05.261]  Threatening the Chief of the Capitol Police to return what is evidence in a criminal investigation of multiple laptops that were stolen from various Congressional offices.
[03:40:05.261 --> 03:40:06.282]  And blackberries.
[03:40:06.282 --> 03:40:06.802]  And blackberries.
[03:40:06.802 --> 03:40:18.690]  Now I believe that if people haven't seen the video of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, there it is, threatening Verterosa, who's the Capitol Police down there on D Street.
[03:40:19.531 --> 03:40:20.532]  She goes right into it.
[03:40:20.532 --> 03:40:26.120]  She threatens his budget three times because she sits on the committee that funds his budget.
[03:40:26.120 --> 03:40:29.445]  And then you have her at the end saying, there will be consequences.
[03:40:30.279 --> 03:40:44.122]  But if that wasn't enough, she just had the Chief Administrative Officer become the three guys that gave the Awans their top secret clearance, or their clearances, and gave them their IT credentials.
[03:40:44.122 --> 03:40:47.603]  And you can watch that video of her blaming them.
[03:40:47.603 --> 03:40:52.784]  Now she's the person who gave Imran Awan her laptop and her password.
[03:40:53.695 --> 03:40:56.897]  And these, it wouldn't, this isn't just email going back and forth.
[03:40:56.897 --> 03:41:00.899]  These are people that sit on some of the most sensitive committees in the Congress.
[03:41:00.899 --> 03:41:06.442]  House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, DHS, and Foreign Affairs.
[03:41:06.442 --> 03:41:10.704]  Like Andre Carson, Becerra, Jackie Speier.
[03:41:11.837 --> 03:41:15.583]  Swalwell we saw in the hall and had a small army around him.
[03:41:15.583 --> 03:41:18.889]  We went to Devin Nunes' office to try to promote this.
[03:41:18.889 --> 03:41:23.557]  We were trying to get, you could just feel it, you could feel it that this story was about ready to break.
[03:41:24.218 --> 03:41:24.958]  Yeah.
[03:41:24.958 --> 03:41:27.379]  I have mountains of evidence, 700 videos out there.
[03:41:27.379 --> 03:41:31.139]  People want to look at all the evidence.
[03:41:31.139 --> 03:41:37.981]  Yeah, and those are on the George Webb YouTube channel, which is essentially sort of like a raw intelligence feed every day.
[03:41:37.981 --> 03:41:42.522]  It's kind of like what an editor would see coming back from a reporter coming back in from the field.
[03:41:42.522 --> 03:41:47.583]  And then Jason, kind of on Crowdsource the Truth, we talk about the evidence.
[03:41:47.583 --> 03:41:49.623]  For instance, we got a thumb drive that may have been
[03:41:50.627 --> 03:41:52.768]  Seth Rich's thumb drive.
[03:41:52.768 --> 03:41:55.189]  I said May.
[03:41:55.189 --> 03:42:08.016]  I used big capital letters, May, but it was from Bernie People up in Boston that worked with the NGP Van software that Seth worked for.
[03:42:08.016 --> 03:42:12.598]  We've talked to experts in Australia who say that yes, Bernie Backups
[03:42:13.718 --> 03:42:17.701]  I could go look at Bernie data and Bernie could go look at my data.
[03:42:17.701 --> 03:42:20.963]  They even accused Bernie of looking at their data in December of 2015.
[03:42:22.934 --> 03:42:32.700]  He confirmed that during the backup process, and the process had control of all the files, that this data was swipeable, I guess, or hackable.
[03:42:32.700 --> 03:42:34.441]  It was visible to all users.
[03:42:34.441 --> 03:42:36.882]  And Steph Rich was pissed.
[03:42:36.882 --> 03:42:37.943]  I mean, that's the bottom line.
[03:42:37.943 --> 03:42:42.065]  You know, and just to clarify, Mike, this is not George making these claims.
[03:42:42.065 --> 03:42:42.465]  D.C.
[03:42:42.465 --> 03:42:49.029]  Capitol Police consider the Iwan Brothers suspects in burglaries and hacking of the House of Representatives.
[03:42:49.531 --> 03:42:50.892]  And we've spoken to experts.
[03:42:50.892 --> 03:43:03.062]  We just earlier this week, George and I went and did what I can really only categorize as sort of like an intelligence assessment with Dr. Corsi all about how this NGP VANS system works.
[03:43:03.062 --> 03:43:06.045]  And what it is, is it's a database that's essentially a
[03:43:06.705 --> 03:43:12.389]  Continuous accumulation of data from the time it was installed up until today.
[03:43:12.389 --> 03:43:27.661]  So when we say that the data dump that we just released last night on various Google Drive accounts that have already been taken down, not by us, but someone who has access to our Google Drive accounts, you know, that NGP ban system
[03:43:28.408 --> 03:43:33.613]  Would contain data that would have been leaked by Seth Rich and additional data since then.
[03:43:33.613 --> 03:43:37.036]  Because it just keeps adding more and more data to it.
[03:43:37.036 --> 03:43:50.848]  And what we do with CrowdSource The Truth is we push George's raw intelligence out to the open source community and we are already getting back some incredible assessments from IT people, people with legal experience, doctors.
[03:43:50.848 --> 03:43:53.531]  It has proven to be an incredibly powerful
[03:43:55.321 --> 03:44:05.924]  In analyzing the intelligence, for instance, that Jason did with Rod Wheeler, we had him for a photo shoot and both of us interviewed him.
[03:44:05.924 --> 03:44:14.966]  We went through an intelligence assessment of every piece of evidence and we really came up with only two pieces of evidence that we know for sure.
[03:44:14.966 --> 03:44:20.468]  We push all the testimony of humans aside and we start with the metadata.
[03:44:21.028 --> 03:44:22.069]  What are the two facts?
[03:44:22.069 --> 03:44:28.313]  It's the same thing that Kim Dotcom tweeted about and he put part of the file name out there.
[03:44:28.313 --> 03:44:32.296]  One is the FBI confiscated Seth Rich's phone.
[03:44:32.296 --> 03:44:35.579]  The other one is they confiscated his laptop.
[03:44:35.579 --> 03:44:40.022]  Now the third bombshell that Rod dropped on us was there may be an FBI bullet.
[03:44:40.711 --> 03:44:44.892]  And that would have gone into a secure evidence bag as well.
[03:44:44.892 --> 03:44:58.656]  And the fourth thing that came from our law enforcement community is there's no way that story with the gun, getting the long gun out of the FBI car, there's no way it can possibly be true because there's an electronic tumbler.
[03:44:58.656 --> 03:45:02.677]  You have to hit a switch to enact the tumbler to get the long rifle out.
[03:45:02.677 --> 03:45:05.318]  The gun is usually going to be on the hip of the FBI agent.
[03:45:05.778 --> 03:45:07.379]  And then the secure phone.
[03:45:07.379 --> 03:45:11.220]  All DC communications and Capitol Police communications are encrypted.
[03:45:11.220 --> 03:45:17.182]  The encrypted phone is going to be in a secure lockbox as well with the trip that you have to know how to press.
[03:45:17.182 --> 03:45:17.962]  You have to know.
[03:45:17.962 --> 03:45:29.826]  So this idea that somehow this, you know, somebody got into the FBI car and then and that's how they shot Seth Rich is really quite a stretch.
[03:45:29.826 --> 03:45:30.986]  Again, metadata.
[03:45:30.986 --> 03:45:32.307]  We focus on the metadata.
[03:45:33.550 --> 03:45:39.296]  Yeah, the Seth Rich thing is definitely a different conversation for another day.
[03:45:39.296 --> 03:45:49.226]  The A1 Brothers, I think, is a massive story because right now the fake news media is going into overdrive to get everybody to quit talking about it.
[03:45:49.226 --> 03:45:51.409]  I'm going to read you a quote from
[03:45:52.069 --> 03:46:04.917]  The Newsweek right now, so Newsweek just published an article, the far-right's fake news story of the week was hijacked by the tragic death of Baratheon Weissnacht.
[03:46:04.917 --> 03:46:14.663]  So they're trying to say in Newsweek and other fake news outlets that the A1 Brothers is not a real story and yet, and yet in this very article,
[03:46:15.592 --> 03:46:22.217]  They admit that the Awan Brothers stole data, but what they're trying to say is... Here, I'll read the paragraph.
[03:46:22.217 --> 03:46:28.201]  Among those who were the victims of the Awan Brothers' data theft was Wasserman Schiltz, the former D.C.
[03:46:28.201 --> 03:46:29.302]  head.
[03:46:29.302 --> 03:46:36.368]  There was as many as 80 members may have been targets of the Awans, who are now the subjects of a criminal probe.
[03:46:36.368 --> 03:46:42.072]  So, what fascinates me about that paragraph is, if Wasserman Schiltz is a crime victim,
[03:46:42.978 --> 03:46:50.081]  Why did she tell the Capitol Police that she was going to defund them and get people fired if they investigated the crime?
[03:46:50.081 --> 03:46:59.005]  So what would your reaction to be to the fake news narrative that Deborah Wasserman Schultz was actually a victim of the Awan Brothers?
[03:46:59.005 --> 03:47:09.570]  Okay, yeah, so that's what's interesting.
[03:47:09.570 --> 03:47:11.091]  We were just talking to George Webb.
[03:47:11.940 --> 03:47:15.265]  And I believe John Goodman about the Ewan Brothers.
[03:47:15.265 --> 03:47:18.449]  So that's what I find fascinating is right now.
[03:47:18.449 --> 03:47:21.353]  That's how you know that you're over the target.
[03:47:21.353 --> 03:47:27.061]  Right now in Newsweek, they're literally trying to claim that the Ewan Brothers story is a fake news story.
[03:47:27.061 --> 03:47:28.203]  Okay, so you guys are back.
[03:47:28.203 --> 03:47:28.964]  So react to that.
[03:47:29.642 --> 03:47:34.705]  Mike, Debbie Wasserman Schultz's own behavior is the real indicator right there.
[03:47:34.705 --> 03:47:38.747]  How can someone threaten the police to give back evidence in a criminal investigation?
[03:47:38.747 --> 03:47:41.429]  So my direct reporting is, I went to D.C.
[03:47:41.429 --> 03:47:45.711]  I knocked on the 12 homes associated with Imran Awan.
[03:47:45.711 --> 03:47:51.054]  The last home I went to was in Lorton, Virginia, 9667 Hawkshead Drive.
[03:47:51.054 --> 03:47:51.895]  I knocked on the door.
[03:47:51.895 --> 03:47:53.716]  A Marine answers the door.
[03:47:55.147 --> 03:47:58.089]  I say, do you know Imran Awan?
[03:47:58.089 --> 03:47:59.730]  He says, no.
[03:47:59.730 --> 03:48:02.973]  Well, he says yes, but he didn't say his name, Imran Awan.
[03:48:02.973 --> 03:48:04.875]  He said his name was Alex.
[03:48:04.875 --> 03:48:07.477]  I said, is he the person who rented you the home?
[03:48:07.477 --> 03:48:08.498]  Yes.
[03:48:08.498 --> 03:48:10.819]  He rented it through my wife, Hina Albi.
[03:48:10.819 --> 03:48:14.302]  Now, both of them fled to Pakistan, according to news reports.
[03:48:14.302 --> 03:48:17.125]  But then I said, is there anything strange you noticed in the house?
[03:48:17.125 --> 03:48:18.786]  And he said, yes.
[03:48:18.786 --> 03:48:21.088]  There was a pile of blackberries and there was a
[03:48:21.744 --> 03:48:22.184]  We're good to go.
[03:48:40.413 --> 03:48:43.176]  And he said that he called the police.
[03:48:43.176 --> 03:48:44.557]  He called the FBI.
[03:48:44.557 --> 03:48:50.502]  The FBI came over and got the Blackberries and came over and got the laptops.
[03:48:50.502 --> 03:48:54.026]  Now, he's out of the Marines now, but his wife still works.
[03:48:54.818 --> 03:48:56.839]  His name is Andre Packard.
[03:48:56.839 --> 03:48:58.520]  It's again on my channel.
[03:48:58.520 --> 03:49:02.543]  T-H-E-G-A-R-T.
[03:49:02.543 --> 03:49:17.312]  His wife's in the Navy, so NCIS, which is the investigative body of the Office of Naval Intelligence, came over and interviewed his wife because they were concerned that maybe she had stolen these blackberries, these congressional blackberries and laptops.
[03:49:17.312 --> 03:49:17.792]  Okay?
[03:49:19.744 --> 03:49:22.366]  Again, not me, Andre Taggart.
[03:49:22.366 --> 03:49:28.072]  I was in conversation all that night with Luke Rosiak, so I have the text to prove it.
[03:49:28.072 --> 03:49:36.519]  And so the third thing he said was, it's been relegated to the Capitol Police, and the Capitol Police have those laptops and have those BlackBerries.
[03:49:36.519 --> 03:49:40.663]  Now, Debbie Wasserman Schultz keeps proving my case for me.
[03:49:40.663 --> 03:49:44.467]  She keeps calling these people on the carpet and blaming them for something she did.
[03:49:45.174 --> 03:49:49.878]  And it's, I almost want to go watch her because she's going to prove it for me.
[03:49:49.878 --> 03:49:52.140]  Yeah, she's really the one who's giving all the evidence.
[03:49:52.140 --> 03:49:56.604]  You know, the other thing that's worth mentioning, Mike, it's not Jason and George who are saying this stuff.
[03:49:56.604 --> 03:50:07.373]  The Iwan brothers' own stepmother filed a police report in which she accused them of threatening her with kidnapping her relatives in Pakistan and they hacked her cell phone.
[03:50:07.373 --> 03:50:08.574]  This is all coming from her, not us.
[03:50:10.497 --> 03:50:16.059]  She's Pakistani, so this isn't an anti-Pakistani thing or an anti-Muslim thing at all.
[03:50:16.059 --> 03:50:22.901]  I have fought for Muslim civil rights in the past against Andrew McCabe, the current director of the FBI.
[03:50:22.901 --> 03:50:28.342]  If you look at the Portland Christmas tree bomber case, so let's just put the anti-Muslim thing aside.
[03:50:28.342 --> 03:50:37.245]  We had an Albanian Muslim come up to us on the street when we went over to report on David Petraeus speaking at the 92nd Street Y, and he said, I want to get my picture with you.
[03:50:39.326 --> 03:50:41.227]  Alright, well thanks guys for having me on.
[03:50:41.227 --> 03:50:43.969]  We might be able to carry it over to the next segment.
[03:50:43.969 --> 03:50:44.069]  Okay.
[03:50:44.069 --> 03:50:46.951]  But we are, yeah, we're definitely, we're about to go on break.
[03:50:46.951 --> 03:50:50.133]  That was a great 18-minute primer to the Awan Brothers.
[03:50:50.133 --> 03:50:54.715]  As those of you listening get the, get the vibe, this is a huge story.
[03:50:54.715 --> 03:50:57.677]  The fake news media does not want you to know about it.
[03:50:57.677 --> 03:50:58.998]  So we'll come back after the break.
[03:51:00.973 --> 03:51:03.555]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[03:51:03.555 --> 03:51:05.698]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[03:51:05.698 --> 03:51:07.679]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[03:51:07.679 --> 03:51:09.741]  Find your happiness with Pure Soap.

[03:51:21.112 --> 03:51:24.095]  You're getting soap products twice as good as what you're using now.
[03:51:24.375 --> 03:51:26.637]  Earth-friendly and natural soaps.
[03:51:26.637 --> 03:51:28.418]  Your family deserves the best.
[03:51:28.418 --> 03:51:31.080]  Happiness is 5starsoap.com.
[03:51:31.080 --> 03:51:33.862]  Why not put your money up the drain for a change?

[03:52:00.358 --> 03:52:10.542]  In America's 240-plus year history, we have seen veterans from the first battles at Lexington and Concord right through to our military trying to take out ISIS today.
[03:52:10.862 --> 03:52:14.605]  Fight their hearts out and in many cases give the ultimate sacrifice.
[03:52:14.605 --> 03:52:16.947]  That's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[03:52:16.947 --> 03:52:21.390]  It's those that made the ultimate sacrifice for the belief they were building a better world.
[03:52:21.390 --> 03:52:33.679]  This group of specials for 2017 Memorial Day are undoubtedly the biggest we've ever had on these items because we want to really memorialize the true trailblazers that put it all on the line and didn't talk but took action.

[03:54:01.765 --> 03:54:09.991]  And we're back, Mike Skernovich, with the fourth hour final segment.
[03:54:09.991 --> 03:54:14.094]  Twitter.com forward slash T-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H.
[03:54:14.094 --> 03:54:21.319]  Before we go into there, I thought it'd be good to talk about how we pulled out of the Paris Accord and how that relates to sunscreen.
[03:54:21.719 --> 03:54:24.680]  Now, a lot of you are going to say, wait, wait, wait, this doesn't make any sense.
[03:54:24.680 --> 03:54:25.801]  I'll tell you why.
[03:54:25.801 --> 03:54:32.324]  Right now, there's a very new powerful sunscreen by InfoWars that has zinc oxide.
[03:54:32.324 --> 03:54:45.310]  Well, a lot of people don't realize, especially younger people, is that when I was a kid, the so-called scientists and experts said there's a hole in the ozone layer and you better put on sunscreen or else you're all going to die of skin cancer.
[03:54:45.310 --> 03:54:50.352]  Well, as it turns out, that goop, that crap that you smear all over and
[03:54:50.792 --> 03:54:52.533]  It looks gross.
[03:54:52.533 --> 03:54:55.655]  I don't even know what it is, like saliva or something like that.
[03:54:55.655 --> 03:54:59.878]  That actually can accelerate and cause skin cancer.
[03:54:59.878 --> 03:55:08.064]  The only skin care products I use for sunscreen, they all contain zinc oxide because that reflects some of the harmful UV rays.
[03:55:08.704 --> 03:55:18.011]  So we want everybody, that's what people got to understand, is even though we cover the news, even though we cover a lot of the threats to America, we want you to be healthy, wealthy, wise.
[03:55:18.011 --> 03:55:25.517]  We don't want you using products that are poisoned and full of toxins, the traditional kind of goop stuff.
[03:55:25.517 --> 03:55:32.942]  So make sure you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get rid of these chemical products that you buy at the supermarket.
[03:55:32.942 --> 03:55:34.604]  You're funding the InfoWar.
[03:55:34.604 --> 03:55:36.105]  You're also taking care of yourself.
[03:55:36.625 --> 03:55:39.247]  And you're making your family clean and healthy.
[03:55:39.247 --> 03:55:40.588]  So with that, I mean, that's great.
[03:55:40.588 --> 03:55:42.290]  That's what I use, the zinc oxide stuff.
[03:55:42.290 --> 03:55:43.190]  It really is the truth.
[03:55:43.190 --> 03:55:50.216]  I'm glad Alex finally has that because now I can buy my sunscreen from him rather than some, you know, corporation.
[03:55:50.216 --> 03:55:52.878]  But the final segment, we just have a couple more minutes.
[03:55:52.878 --> 03:55:58.143]  The A1 Brothers story is so important that we could talk about this for hours and hours and hours.
[03:55:58.143 --> 03:56:02.206]  But there's a paragraph I wanted to read out of Newsweek.
[03:56:02.206 --> 03:56:05.729]  So Newsweek is calling the A1 Brothers fake news.
[03:56:06.809 --> 03:56:21.674]  But even in their article criticizing us, there's a line there, they go, Wasserman Schultz, for some reason, retained Ewan in an advisory capacity, even after the Capitol Police investigation and the Ewan family seemed to be ramping up.
[03:56:21.674 --> 03:56:23.395]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:56:23.395 --> 03:56:24.755]  Hold on a second.
[03:56:24.755 --> 03:56:34.279]  If the Ewan brothers' story is fake news, and there's nothing to see here, and Deborah Wasserman Schultz is just a poor, helpless crime victim, why was she paying money
[03:56:35.342 --> 03:56:37.823]  To criminal suspects.
[03:56:37.823 --> 03:56:42.244]  Why is she trying to shut down the investigation?
[03:56:42.244 --> 03:56:45.184]  The fake news media, they're really running scared here.
[03:56:45.184 --> 03:57:00.728]  They don't want you to know this story, so make sure when this video goes on the Alex Jones YouTube channel, clip it, snip it, put it in your social media, put it all over, share these articles, blast them out, because that's why they want to shut us down.
[03:57:00.728 --> 03:57:02.949]  Newsweek is literally calling it fake news.
[03:57:03.809 --> 03:57:16.481]  Even though there's a criminal investigation and even though Wasserman Schultz paid criminals after they were being investigated for sharing top secret emails to Islamic terrorist groups.
[03:57:16.481 --> 03:57:18.423]  So we got just 90 seconds.
[03:57:18.423 --> 03:57:25.170]  George Webb, Jason Goodman, what is your final parting shot to the truth warriors at home who really want to know what is going on?
[03:57:26.348 --> 03:57:31.031]  Well, really, it's leveraging more media, and thank you, Mike, for this opportunity.
[03:57:31.031 --> 03:57:36.014]  We send everything, and I have been sending things to WikiLeaks for a long time.
[03:57:36.014 --> 03:57:38.636]  I'm TruthLeaks on Twitter.
[03:57:38.636 --> 03:57:46.301]  And even before the WikiLeaks network and the WikiLeaks founders all died, the top three
[03:57:47.697 --> 03:57:51.079]  I was involved in getting them information with Thumb Drive.
[03:57:51.079 --> 03:57:53.400]  So this Thumb Drive thing isn't new.
[03:57:53.400 --> 03:57:55.161]  And the Juan Brothers in Washington, D.C.
[03:57:55.161 --> 03:57:55.741]  are not new.
[03:57:55.741 --> 03:58:00.924]  Go back to Inter-America, and I can't remember... Juan Gutierrez.
[03:58:00.924 --> 03:58:06.147]  And he says right in the article, we provide people from other countries to come into the U.S.
[03:58:06.147 --> 03:58:07.747]  This is an old story.
[03:58:07.747 --> 03:58:09.948]  To do their laptops and BlackBerrys.
[03:58:12.603 --> 03:58:22.831]  Mike, we're developing a bunch of other stories about how they got their visas and things that tie the Awan brothers to potential hacking of the NGP van system, the voter database.
[03:58:22.831 --> 03:58:27.974]  So there's not any shortage of evidence and there's a lot more to come out of this story.
[03:58:27.974 --> 03:58:28.615]  Thanks so much.
[03:58:28.615 --> 03:58:30.256]  We will definitely be covering this more.
[03:58:30.256 --> 03:58:31.677]  Thanks for coming, guys.
