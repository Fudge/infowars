[00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.012]  about the threats, and I believe that humanity, when faced with a threat, would take action against it.
[00:00:05.653 --> 00:00:10.836]  So many times globalists would tell me that, oh Alex, they're a bunch of cowards, you're just scaring them for us.
[00:00:11.417 --> 00:00:21.023]  And I would always say, no, humanity, at least a large part of it, when faced with the truth, will do what it takes to defeat your unelected planetary dictatorship.
[00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:29.769]  Wednesday, May 3rd, and Thursday, May 4th, we're doing a 30 hour transmission that kicked off at 11am on Wednesday.
[00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.517]  And we've got Congressman Ron Paul and so many other amazing patriots joining us.
[00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:41.646]  I hope that you'll do several things during this important transmission to defend free speech and defend what's left of the West.
[00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:53.708]  I hope you'll spread the link at Infowars.com forward slash show to new people who've never heard of the show, or who have heard of us being demonized in the national news, but have not actually heard the message.
[00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:56.691]  Tell people, this is the forbidden message.
[00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:58.692]  This is the show they don't want you to hear.
[00:00:58.993 --> 00:01:01.154]  This is the show the globalists are afraid of.
[00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:06.519]  That's why they're trying to assassinate my character, my crew's character, and the rest of our host character.
[00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:11.663]  Because they understand we're promoting freedom, open society, goodwill.
[00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:14.972]  The globalists are selling division and evil.
[00:01:15.392 --> 00:01:19.114]  So please spread the word about the live transmission so we can reach new people.
[00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:19.715]  That's the goal.
[00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:21.956]  Will this 30-hour broadcast save the world?
[00:01:22.036 --> 00:01:22.256]  No.
[00:01:22.696 --> 00:01:28.279]  But it is the spirit of defiance and the incremental march against tyranny that overall will save the world.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.742]  My friends, we can come together as one human race that bleeds red blood.
[00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:33.675]  Yes.
[00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.377]  And also financially support us because that's what funds us.
[00:01:51.717 --> 00:02:02.103]  We don't have George Soros or the Ford Foundation or the federal government funding us like MSNBC and CNN or the Saudis and the Mexican kingpin Carlos Slim funding the New York Times.
[00:02:02.603 --> 00:02:17.192]  We have people like you buying Molon Labe t-shirts and high-quality non-GMO heirloom seed banks to plant summer and fall gardens and high-quality water filtration systems that are the very best out there at the lowest prices.
[00:02:17.648 --> 00:02:22.309]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products at infowarestore.com.
[00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:28.070]  We have a huge line of nutraceuticals, many of which are household names that we've private labeled at lower prices.
[00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.751]  A lot of stuff that Whole Foods carries.
[00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:36.272]  And many of which I've developed with top producers, scientists, and researchers like Knockout, our amazing Sleep Aid.
[00:02:36.672 --> 00:02:46.855]  And when you purchase these products, it funds what we're doing and really puts a stick in the eye of the globalists like George Soros and others that are doing everything they can right now to shut us down.
[00:02:47.355 --> 00:02:49.916]  The law firm George Soros funded is suing me right now.
[00:02:50.396 --> 00:02:53.377]  A member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York is suing me right now.
[00:02:53.757 --> 00:03:00.299]  The globalists are doing everything they can to silence us and to demonize me and to destroy my family, quite frankly.
[00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:06.361]  But they're following the arrogance of the elite that has brought them down throughout history.
[00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:08.602]  Because the world sees the attacks.
[00:03:08.662 --> 00:03:09.482]  They see the lies.
[00:03:09.802 --> 00:03:10.902]  They see the demonization.
[00:03:11.683 --> 00:03:15.704]  And so we've never had more visitors, more traffic at InfoWars.com.
[00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:25.968]  The problem is the attacks are sustained, they're intensifying, and so even though we're growing, it's not quite fast enough to be able to defeat their attack profile.
[00:03:26.328 --> 00:03:37.312]  So that's why I'm asking you to double down so they see us really grow, not just stay the same, and understand that their attempts to shut us down will be met with total resolve and commitment.
[00:03:37.732 --> 00:03:42.914]  We have huge specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:44.256]  I'm
[00:04:04.502 --> 00:04:04.883]  We're good
[00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:23.886]  I don't
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.821]  Thank you.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:09.788]  And you can get 10% off and then don't have to remember to keep supporting us and also get the products that obviously run out that you've got to replenish.
[00:05:10.028 --> 00:05:11.570]  These are great renewable resources.
[00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.011]  Please continue to support us.
[00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:15.593]  Again, I want to defeat the globalists.
[00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:16.314]  I'm determined.
[00:05:16.394 --> 00:05:16.914]  I'm focused.
[00:05:17.455 --> 00:05:25.362]  But without you spreading the word, without you financially supporting us and without you praying for us, we don't have a chance in hell.
[00:05:25.762 --> 00:05:27.564]  But if you get behind us like you've already done,
[00:05:29.192 --> 00:05:30.112]  Turn it up a notch?
[00:05:30.793 --> 00:05:34.314]  We are unstoppable, ladies and gentlemen, because humans want freedom.
[00:05:34.654 --> 00:05:36.934]  We want to have a shared destiny together.
[00:05:37.194 --> 00:05:38.375]  We want to go to the stars.
[00:05:38.775 --> 00:05:40.015]  Look how far we've already come.
[00:05:40.255 --> 00:05:41.996]  So let's tell the globalists we're not trash.
[00:05:42.296 --> 00:05:45.297]  Let's tell Bill Guy, the science guy, that we're going to have more than one child.
[00:05:45.577 --> 00:05:48.578]  Let's tell David Rockefeller that, you know, we're not subhumans.
[00:05:48.878 --> 00:05:53.079]  Let's tell Ted Turner, who could have five kids, but tells us we're subhuman, he can go to hell.
[00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:54.620]  And let's take action.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:03.272]  There's nowhere you could spend your hard-earned money to get better products and then make sure that money goes to a good cause than InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:06:03.512 --> 00:06:04.834]  But regardless of what you do...
[00:06:05.851 --> 00:06:16.336]  Spread the links, spread the articles, and let people know about this 30-hour special broadcast so new people tune in and learn about the nightly news, the daily show I do, and the news sites and everything we're engaged in.
[00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:21.759]  Because we're not perfect, but our hearts are in the right place and we are pulling as hard as we can for victory.
[00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:30.583]  Now back to the live transmission with the amazing host and guest and special reports during the 30-hour broadcast that we're now partway into.
[00:06:30.943 --> 00:06:33.404]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:06:33.704 --> 00:06:34.945]  Please spread that link.
[00:06:49.918 --> 00:07:04.208]  Ridley Scott, the director of the upcoming film Alien Covenant, has now giving interviews where he admits that he believes aliens are real and are coming to destroy us and that his new film is actually a warning.
[00:07:11.701 --> 00:07:24.465]  Five years ago, in March of 2012, months before the film came out, I released an analysis of the upcoming film by Ridley Scott, Prometheus.
[00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:38.389]  In the analysis, I broke down the fact that from my sources and my own research, Ridley Scott was engaging in a revelation of the method to the population of this planet
[00:07:39.798 --> 00:07:50.554]  Of the fact that the ruling elite of this globe believe that humans were seeded here by advanced extraterrestrials of our own species.
[00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:53.378]  Now to be clear, this is not what I believe.
[00:07:54.209 --> 00:08:02.291]  But wearing my sociologist-anthropologist hat, I am simply breaking down from my research what the elite believe.
[00:08:03.272 --> 00:08:16.716]  I also postulated that in future films, he would break down a Genesis-type cosmology, further fleshing out what the social engineers actually believe.
[00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:25.841]  They are pushing to re-engineer the advanced civilizations that they believe we were seeded by.
[00:08:25.861 --> 00:08:33.147]  Now again, I want to be clear before Stephen Colbert attacks me or the New York Times does a piece, that is not what I'm saying here today.
[00:08:34.068 --> 00:08:36.430]  I am only telling you what the elite believe.
[00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:42.955]  So I laid out to you, from my research, what these films were about and what Ridley Scott was really trying to do.
[00:08:43.595 --> 00:08:51.061]  And now, five years later, aliens are real and will probably destroy us, says director Ridley Scott.
[00:08:51.481 --> 00:08:59.327]  And he admits these films are actually his attempt to lay out our creation, cosmology, exactly as I predicted.
[00:08:59.987 --> 00:09:09.256]  Scott goes on to say there are 200 species of aliens out there that we know of and that they could wipe us out at an instant anytime they want.
[00:09:09.637 --> 00:09:13.801]  This is Ridley Scott of Blade Runner and all these incredible other futurist films.
[00:09:15.629 --> 00:09:18.191]  And he's being used just like H.G.
[00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:32.723]  Wells was over a hundred years ago for revelation of a method to predictively program us and to prepare us for what is coming or what they believe with genetic engineering that they are about to be able to manifest themselves.
[00:09:33.284 --> 00:09:33.924]  And I want to be clear.
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.501]  Now, how was I able to break this down when nobody else could?
[00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:50.187]  Because I've studied the Illuminati, I've studied the globalists, I've studied the different futurist societies, and the advanced technology they believe they're receiving basically interdimensionally from these advanced life forms.
[00:09:50.767 --> 00:09:52.808]  And I want to be clear, I'm not saying I believe that.
[00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:54.509]  That's what the elites believe.
[00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.830]  And so, let's go deeper here.
[00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:00.192]  Scott and others in the elite
[00:10:01.397 --> 00:10:10.955]  Believe that they're not just awaiting aliens that are going to arrive here, but that they are reverse engineering what our species has developed and done before.
[00:10:11.894 --> 00:10:23.322]  And what's scary about this is, when you then research what currently is happening in genetic engineering, it's already surpassing many of the things you see in the alien franchise.
[00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:27.285]  The globalists believe they are the planetary controllers.
[00:10:27.666 --> 00:10:29.207]  They are the engineers.
[00:10:29.687 --> 00:10:31.068]  They are the Anunnaki.
[00:10:31.368 --> 00:10:32.890]  They are the enlightened ones.
[00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:44.235]  And they're here to cull the earth of all the excess humans so the new super race, biomechanical, human merged with machine, can rise from the ashes.
[00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:50.718]  And Ridley Scott first talked about that in the late 1970s when the first alien film came out.
[00:10:51.258 --> 00:10:54.680]  Now, 40 years later, let's look at the reality.
[00:10:54.941 --> 00:10:57.822]  Not of his films, but of what's currently happening.
[00:10:58.063 --> 00:10:58.903]  Look at this headline.
[00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:03.886]  Firestorm brewing as scientists work to create synthetic human DNA.
[00:11:04.267 --> 00:11:07.529]  Lab-grown meat coming to supermarket shelves soon.
[00:11:07.789 --> 00:11:08.950]  This is in the news today.
[00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.932]  The birth of half-human, half-animal chimeras.
[00:11:12.352 --> 00:11:13.392]  BBC.
[00:11:13.712 --> 00:11:15.433]  That's been going on 30 years, they admit.
[00:11:15.773 --> 00:11:17.353]  Here's MIT Tech Review.
[00:11:17.693 --> 00:11:22.275]  Human-animal chimeras are gestating, just like an alien, on U.S.
[00:11:22.555 --> 00:11:23.795]  research farms.
[00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:28.977]  CIA implanted microphones into cats in an attempt to spy on Russia.
[00:11:29.217 --> 00:11:31.017]  They had implanted antennas in their tails.
[00:11:31.597 --> 00:11:33.518]  That was in the early 1960s.
[00:11:33.538 --> 00:11:35.678]  50-plus years ago.
[00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:37.419]  Imagine where we are today.
[00:11:38.752 --> 00:11:46.798]  And then you look, not at the biological engineering, but the supercomputers, and the Super Hadron Collider, as we unlock the mysteries of the universe.
[00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:56.244]  Understand, many of these mysteries have already been theoretically unlocked hundreds of years ago, and now have been actually unlocked.
[00:11:58.546 --> 00:12:00.908]  Think about what they haven't told us about.
[00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:06.091]  Ladies and gentlemen, in 1900, Max Planck envisioned the atomic bomb.
[00:12:06.692 --> 00:12:06.832]  By 1906,
[00:12:09.404 --> 00:12:09.624]  H.G.
[00:12:09.664 --> 00:12:11.065]  Wells had written books about it.
[00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:16.608]  And by 1945, we were dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[00:12:17.109 --> 00:12:17.329]  That's 1945.
[00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:23.492]  Long before the pocket calculator was developed by Texas Instruments.
[00:12:24.113 --> 00:12:28.715]  Think about that growth curve in understanding towards the singularity.
[00:12:29.436 --> 00:12:34.659]  And if we as a species don't have a real debate about this, we don't have any future.
[00:12:35.543 --> 00:12:44.957]  Just a few weeks ago, I called a press conference and I brought up the fact that human-animal hybrids is one of the biggest threats to our species because it gives rise to mutated viruses and bacteria.
[00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:48.962]  And the modern press, more than a dozen national TV cameras,
[00:12:50.214 --> 00:12:56.339]  Laughed at me, and they wrote stories all over the news making fun of me, basically saying this doesn't exist.
[00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:58.280]  Think about that.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:09.608]  30 years after human-animal clones have been admitted to have been created in the embryonic level, and obviously secretly brought to term, it's still a joke to the press corps that I was talking to.
[00:13:10.229 --> 00:13:17.894]  It's like I parachuted into some forbidden island in the Pacific Ocean, and natives were firing arrows at me with their bows.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.562]  They see it as that threatening that I'm there giving them admitted science.
[00:13:24.742 --> 00:13:26.582]  The future is here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:26.943 --> 00:13:29.163]  It just hasn't been equally distributed.
[00:13:29.623 --> 00:13:44.928]  And if we don't demand that these technologies be revealed and that the positive attributes of them be deployed to us, we are locking ourselves into a new dark age while the globalists break away with a breakaway civilization.
[00:13:45.749 --> 00:13:46.509]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:13:48.106 --> 00:13:49.067]  And you have been warned.
[00:13:49.868 --> 00:13:52.510]  You love to fight!
[00:13:53.251 --> 00:14:00.999]  You're getting it!
[00:14:08.109 --> 00:14:20.498]  That's Alex Jones discussing the future of humanity and secret knowledge that is being held back from the general population so that they can advance to the next level while we wither away in the dust.
[00:14:20.518 --> 00:14:29.785]  I always like to paint the analogy of Bill Gates floating up in the hot air bloom and he's cutting the ladder down as everybody on earth is grabbing for it.
[00:14:30.225 --> 00:14:38.088]  Well, Alex Jones also discussed the future of social media and what Facebook is doing to try to manipulate the minds of the youth.
[00:14:38.548 --> 00:14:39.468]  Truly disgusting.
[00:14:39.528 --> 00:14:40.688]  Here's Alex Jones' report.
[00:14:43.609 --> 00:14:52.432]  My friends, Mark Zuckerberg, working with the CIA, this is all public, set up Facebook.
[00:14:53.552 --> 00:14:55.093]  Google was also set up by the CIA.
[00:14:58.264 --> 00:14:59.024]  Founding of Google.
[00:14:59.684 --> 00:15:00.485]  As well as NASA.
[00:15:01.225 --> 00:15:02.265]  For social engineering.
[00:15:02.545 --> 00:15:03.125]  For control.
[00:15:05.106 --> 00:15:05.826]  And that's admitted.
[00:15:06.746 --> 00:15:12.847]  And it's come out in the WikiLeaks that they're working with the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the globalists, the IMF, the World Bank, control people.
[00:15:13.187 --> 00:15:20.169]  Zuckerberg, what, six years ago, said at a conference, I can't believe our users trust us, they're a bunch of dumb effers.
[00:15:23.117 --> 00:15:33.149]  And then I see the different things they do and how Facebook acts like they're open and free and you follow their rules and they censor libertarian or nationalistic or patriotic messages.
[00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.132]  They target people and don't let you share your post.
[00:15:36.953 --> 00:15:39.917]  Even if you pay Facebook to share your post, they block them.
[00:15:42.688 --> 00:15:44.469]  Hillary Clinton propaganda and garbage.
[00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:58.861]  Three weeks ago, we got secret documents from inside Google, thanks to Mike Cernovich, and two days later, Google said, yeah, we had rogue contractor groups with multi-million dollar contracts delisting InfoWars.com as fake news, and we don't believe you're fake news.
[00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:00.142]  Because I can sue them!
[00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:02.255]  But they said they'd stop it.
[00:16:03.216 --> 00:16:04.596]  So I'm not just singling out Facebook.
[00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:11.539]  But something has happened here that the trendies, the Democrats especially, need to understand.
[00:16:11.659 --> 00:16:13.139]  This really affects you.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:23.323]  Facebook has been caught with internal documents leaking because people in their own system care, based in England and Australia.
[00:16:24.855 --> 00:16:34.038]  Where they have been targeting, in a test, 700,000 users who they see as young, as depressed, as vulnerable, and as trendies.
[00:16:35.218 --> 00:16:36.318]  And they use those terms.
[00:16:37.018 --> 00:16:38.099]  Now, what is a trendy?
[00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:41.580]  Somebody who followed Hitler and Nazi Germany early on would be a trendy.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:51.302]  Somebody 200 years ago that was a super Christian religious zealot that wanted to, you know, kill people that danced at the country fair.
[00:16:51.342 --> 00:16:53.043]  Those were trendy zealots.
[00:16:54.548 --> 00:17:00.885]  Muslims becoming radicalized and wanting to sexually mutilate women or throw gays off buildings.
[00:17:00.925 --> 00:17:01.486]  That is
[00:17:02.648 --> 00:17:03.469]  An orthodoxy.
[00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:04.929]  A system of oppression.
[00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.510]  And that's what trendies are.
[00:17:07.271 --> 00:17:09.612]  They believe they're the cultural avant-garde.
[00:17:10.052 --> 00:17:11.773]  And that they're the coolest people out there.
[00:17:12.394 --> 00:17:16.676]  Because they seek what is conformist, they believe, to be in the in crowd.
[00:17:17.637 --> 00:17:20.819]  Well, the system then puts out a plastic, artificial in crowd.
[00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:21.759]  I've talked about this forever.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:27.963]  That Wall Street, that Madison Avenue, that Hollywood has talked about for 60, 70 years.
[00:17:28.303 --> 00:17:30.024]  Edward Bernays created Hollywood.
[00:17:30.825 --> 00:17:30.885]  Or,
[00:17:31.641 --> 00:17:32.262]  We're good to go.
[00:17:45.652 --> 00:17:53.216]  is getting politicians with Hollywood and the media and making it like they're the upper class, they're the beautiful people, and you're a nobody.
[00:17:53.556 --> 00:18:07.064]  And then once you feel like you're not part of the in-class, they're up on a Mount Olympus, like the Greek gods, or demigods in their golden fields of Elysium, and you just don't think you can attain it.
[00:18:07.084 --> 00:18:13.968]  That's the reason government buildings have always been huge and ornate and stately and powerful, is to project this is unstoppable.
[00:18:14.744 --> 00:18:15.925]  And so it was just next level.
[00:18:16.145 --> 00:18:17.926]  And Bernays wrote the book Propaganda.
[00:18:18.627 --> 00:18:19.688]  He coined the term.
[00:18:21.109 --> 00:18:23.010]  The nephew of Sigmund Freud.
[00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:27.513]  And he's the modern propagandist that changed the Department of War to the Department of Peace.
[00:18:28.054 --> 00:18:31.877]  That had feminists walk around with cigarettes saying, don't let your man tell you not to do it.
[00:18:32.217 --> 00:18:36.200]  And the cigarette companies paid him millions in the 20s to call them liberty torches.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.582]  So what I'm about to get to is for you and your family.
[00:18:39.202 --> 00:18:40.083]  For all the trendies.
[00:18:41.141 --> 00:18:50.950]  Republican establishment bluebloods at the country club that think they're real cool and look down on everybody and are mean to the new members or whatever, but people are trying to get in to be part of the cool club.
[00:18:51.731 --> 00:18:52.611]  Those are trendies.
[00:18:52.992 --> 00:18:57.896]  The people oppressing them, the people putting on a show, the people posing, and the trendies begging to get in.
[00:18:59.297 --> 00:19:04.042]  And so now we have the documents, what we already knew was going on, where they target
[00:19:05.245 --> 00:19:24.220]  Young people who go on Facebook, or who they see as alone, who see they as needing friends, and they say, we can now sell certain political systems, certain products, these people, we can bombard women that are just a little bit larger, probably voluptuous, and make them feel like they're fat, so you can then sell them these products.
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.661]  The list goes on and on.
[00:19:25.942 --> 00:19:37.914]  And all I'm saying is, people that buy into the trendy culture, it's in the white papers, it's in the wash tech reports I've seen, where 20 years ago they said we're going to have body augmentation and body
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:20:02.552]  You know, the whole body modification movement, not that it's bad if you've done that, but to get you ready for microchips and virtual reality, and this whole program the CIA funded 25 years ago, the funding of the whole body modification movement to get you to accept that, just like they funded in the 60s ugly art, to then make you confuse and think, well, you don't know what's beautiful art and what's ugly.
[00:20:03.633 --> 00:20:12.005]  So it's mainly a scrambling of social mores so that they can move the Overton window towards ugly architecture, austerity, collapse.
[00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:13.568]  This is all declassified.
[00:20:14.724 --> 00:20:16.125]  That's why they're attacking the family.
[00:20:16.165 --> 00:20:17.686]  That's why they're attacking classical beauty.
[00:20:17.847 --> 00:20:21.429]  That's why they're saying don't have murals of masculine men at colleges.
[00:20:21.449 --> 00:20:24.312]  You know, for the football team, because someone might not be masculine.
[00:20:24.572 --> 00:20:28.455]  Don't say you have a mother and father on your elementary school entry form.
[00:20:28.876 --> 00:20:32.078]  Say, G or Z, because someone might not have a mommy or daddy.
[00:20:32.138 --> 00:20:35.841]  See, you can't have anything because it might hurt somebody else.
[00:20:36.922 --> 00:20:40.525]  Remember, they wrote science fiction books where if somebody's crippled, then you've got to be crippled.
[00:20:40.545 --> 00:20:41.406]  You know, it's like this.
[00:20:43.598 --> 00:20:44.299]  Like 20 years ago.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.360]  Harrison Bergman.
[00:20:45.861 --> 00:20:46.322]  Harrison?
[00:20:46.742 --> 00:20:47.443]  Bergman, I think?
[00:20:47.463 --> 00:20:48.064]  Harrison Bergman.
[00:20:48.104 --> 00:20:49.386]  Bergman, something like that.
[00:20:49.426 --> 00:20:52.710]  And they made movies out of it and made variant rip-offs of it, so...
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:54.320]  We're here.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.841]  This is the total oppression of the hive mind.
[00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:00.842]  And here are these documents where they're trying to make you insecure.
[00:21:00.882 --> 00:21:02.202]  They're trying to prey on you.
[00:21:02.482 --> 00:21:03.722]  They're trying to manipulate you.
[00:21:03.742 --> 00:21:05.623]  They won't let you leave Facebook if you want to.
[00:21:06.503 --> 00:21:07.463]  They're selling your data.
[00:21:07.483 --> 00:21:08.663]  They're calling you a dumb F-er.
[00:21:09.484 --> 00:21:17.925]  And this moves into the cucking we see with Islam that I'm about to get to, where top feminists are putting on hijabs, sexually mutilating, and saying this is trendy.
[00:21:18.326 --> 00:21:19.746]  So it's really...
[00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:22.187]  All about cucking people.
[00:21:22.567 --> 00:21:26.668]  So let me get back into here and show you some of this.
[00:21:26.688 --> 00:21:27.048]  Here it is.
[00:21:27.068 --> 00:21:28.349]  The Australian broke it.
[00:21:29.069 --> 00:21:30.309]  News.com.au.
[00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:37.612]  Leaked document reveals Facebook does research to target emotionally vulnerable and insecure youth who are trying to be trendy, trying to find their identity.
[00:21:37.632 --> 00:21:41.733]  Then it goes into older groups as well, you know, that are seen as desperate.
[00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:45.435]  Now again, these are really beta groups who normally would meet
[00:21:46.375 --> 00:21:53.598]  ...and get involved in some type of culturally successful group that they could work in to be successful.
[00:21:53.658 --> 00:22:12.487]  But instead, they put out fake cultural icons of success so that trendies go and get on these farms, different globalist enclaves, in the broken strategy method, the Democrats call it, of a bunch of balkanized people that can't communicate and are all scared and only safe in their own little cloistered group that is controlled by the central programmers.
[00:22:13.914 --> 00:22:20.498]  And if you look at what they do at major colleges in Europe and here now, scared kids show up from the countryside of the big city.
[00:22:20.858 --> 00:22:21.638]  They don't know what to do.
[00:22:21.698 --> 00:22:28.322]  They get them in student groups and say, there's racist, there's homophobes, there's KKK on the school grounds putting up swastikas.
[00:22:28.762 --> 00:22:30.403]  Come to our group, you'll be safe here.
[00:22:30.843 --> 00:22:33.044]  And they get all the nerds, the most disadvantaged.
[00:22:33.525 --> 00:22:34.545]  There's manuals on this.
[00:22:34.605 --> 00:22:35.245]  It's been in the news.
[00:22:35.586 --> 00:22:40.128]  They target them, and then they bring them in and manage them and politically control them.
[00:22:40.508 --> 00:22:41.389]  So it's kind of like joining
[00:22:41.989 --> 00:22:47.851]  A motorcycle gang or a black gang or a Hispanic gang or a white supremacist gang, except it's a trendy gang.
[00:22:48.471 --> 00:22:53.493]  And then your professors and then their props and their assistants are the new bosses.
[00:22:54.093 --> 00:22:58.815]  And then the police on the liberal campuses let you beat people up, let you have your rite of passage.
[00:22:59.315 --> 00:23:02.196]  So you're suppressed in development all the way up to that point.
[00:23:02.876 --> 00:23:10.561]  And then once you get to them at like 20 years old or so, you're allowed to develop and come into manhood or womanhood, but only through their ideology.
[00:23:10.941 --> 00:23:15.043]  Everything with Dr. Spock was, don't let your kids have any of your identity.
[00:23:15.284 --> 00:23:16.584]  Don't put into them your own thoughts.
[00:23:16.604 --> 00:23:17.585]  Never discipline them.
[00:23:17.965 --> 00:23:19.026]  Let them be their own person.
[00:23:19.066 --> 00:23:22.408]  But that meant let the government and the corporate system shape them.
[00:23:22.808 --> 00:23:26.150]  Arrest their development until they go to college, then put them into the system.
[00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:37.436]  Take advantage of the insecure, of the betas, who want to become the trendies, and who want to be part of the whole system, and who want to laugh at everyone that isn't part of the orthodoxy.
[00:23:38.776 --> 00:23:40.017]  It's a cult, okay?
[00:23:40.457 --> 00:23:41.518]  Just like right-wing churches.
[00:23:42.658 --> 00:23:46.140]  Facebook accused of targeting insecure children and young people.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.402]  Leaked report shows, you read deeper again, it's trendies as well.
[00:23:50.302 --> 00:23:51.683]  Like this woman trying to be a trendie.
[00:23:54.701 --> 00:23:55.741]  It's ironic or whatever.
[00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:58.122]  And that's fine if you want to have your own little style.
[00:23:58.562 --> 00:24:00.322]  It just always goes with some costume.
[00:24:00.702 --> 00:24:01.183]  Look at this.
[00:24:01.803 --> 00:24:04.583]  I started seeing this a few years ago when George Soros would fund women's marches.
[00:24:04.843 --> 00:24:06.744]  They put hijabs on and sing Allah Akbar.
[00:24:07.164 --> 00:24:13.666]  Now, hijab becomes a symbol of resistance, feminism, in the age of Trump.
[00:24:13.746 --> 00:24:14.646]  This was a few months ago.
[00:24:15.786 --> 00:24:18.887]  And these women say they wear the hijab as their freedom.
[00:24:18.907 --> 00:24:21.668]  This is a symbol of being basically owned in the Middle East.
[00:24:21.948 --> 00:24:22.788]  Now let's continue.
[00:24:23.965 --> 00:24:29.588]  I feel empowered that I'm able to, you know, have this control over my image of myself within my own family.
[00:24:29.889 --> 00:24:32.990]  My mom started wearing the hijab when I was 13.
[00:24:33.871 --> 00:24:38.474]  And my sister, who's five years younger than me, started when she was in fifth grade.
[00:24:39.154 --> 00:24:43.357]  So she would have been around, like, nine when she started.
[00:24:46.239 --> 00:25:00.027]  Okay, so let's stop right there, then I've got more.
[00:25:00.748 --> 00:25:02.689]  They're implying they decided to do it.
[00:25:02.749 --> 00:25:06.271]  They go on and attack Trump and say this is their freedom, this is their right to do this.
[00:25:06.972 --> 00:25:09.953]  You are put in prison or killed in almost every Islamic country.
[00:25:10.354 --> 00:25:11.695]  There were a few of them like Iraq.
[00:25:12.668 --> 00:25:17.491]  And Syria, where you didn't have to wear them, and women were the majority of college students, doctors, and scientists.
[00:25:17.792 --> 00:25:18.532]  That's all gone.
[00:25:18.652 --> 00:25:22.175]  Our government, under leftist, globalist Arab Spring, is destroying all that.
[00:25:22.495 --> 00:25:23.215]  That's a fact.
[00:25:23.335 --> 00:25:24.476]  That's been declassified.
[00:25:25.517 --> 00:25:30.420]  Now notice, I was doing these videos just six months ago, and there'd be 100,000 watching live.
[00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:35.143]  We've got more visitors and listeners than ever to our streams at Infowars.com.
[00:25:36.246 --> 00:25:37.186]  And we've got more affiliates.
[00:25:37.226 --> 00:25:37.867]  We're exploding.
[00:25:38.347 --> 00:25:42.008]  But on Facebook and Twitter and Google, they're all tightening us down.
[00:25:42.488 --> 00:25:43.388]  Not letting us share.
[00:25:43.408 --> 00:25:44.228]  Not letting you share.
[00:25:44.449 --> 00:25:47.269]  Not letting it virally show up on all the people that like our pages.
[00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.730]  You've got a hand posted on your site.
[00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:51.211]  You've got a hand.
[00:25:51.351 --> 00:25:51.871]  Send it out.
[00:25:51.891 --> 00:25:57.493]  You've got to tell people Alex Jones is live with breaking news about how Facebook is targeting trendies.
[00:25:57.753 --> 00:26:00.193]  Trendies with a whole fake liberal cosmology.
[00:26:00.754 --> 00:26:01.914]  You're schmucks.
[00:26:02.334 --> 00:26:03.454]  They're laughing at you.
[00:26:03.774 --> 00:26:04.835]  They think you're idiots.
[00:26:05.555 --> 00:26:09.644]  I've had multiple people I knew who got mad at me when they would get Nigeria chain emails.
[00:26:10.802 --> 00:26:17.428]  Going back 10-15 years ago, and I've been going around for 5 years already, it's 20 years old, saying I'm Prince Boo-Boo or Ba-Bee-Ba-Boo-Boo.
[00:26:17.448 --> 00:26:18.489]  It's all these names like that.
[00:26:18.689 --> 00:26:20.130]  I'll give you $5,000 if you give me $1,000.
[00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:23.053]  I'm in a big jam, but I hear you're a good guy.
[00:26:23.073 --> 00:26:24.074]  People go, oh, I'm going to get $5,000.
[00:26:24.114 --> 00:26:24.394]  I give them $1,000.
[00:26:25.015 --> 00:26:27.677]  Then Prince Boo-Boo or Bee-Bee-Boo-Boo says, I need $10,000.
[00:26:28.258 --> 00:26:28.978]  I'll give you, you know, $100,000.
[00:26:29.619 --> 00:26:31.300]  You give them the $10,000.
[00:26:31.761 --> 00:26:33.643]  And you're already so conned by it.
[00:26:34.043 --> 00:26:35.524]  Your hand's already in the wood chipper.
[00:26:35.784 --> 00:26:36.946]  It's already getting sucked in.
[00:26:38.097 --> 00:26:45.825]  It's already in there that you just keep, and I know some people have seen the news, gave a million dollars, always thinking, well now the prince is going to meet with you.
[00:26:46.466 --> 00:26:52.212]  Give us the $100,000 and he'll give you $5 million, but then you can come to the capital of Nigeria and you can meet.
[00:26:52.292 --> 00:26:53.793]  And then, I've been out.
[00:26:54.719 --> 00:26:54.799]  It's
[00:27:16.161 --> 00:27:17.562]  Who would like to invest with me?
[00:27:37.602 --> 00:27:38.602]  That's a Rothschild.
[00:27:38.662 --> 00:27:39.603]  They're really rich.
[00:27:40.524 --> 00:27:41.665]  That's what trendyism is.
[00:27:41.705 --> 00:27:44.127]  You just show up and you go, Facebook's the coolest thing.
[00:27:44.147 --> 00:27:44.967]  Oh, it's all over.
[00:27:45.307 --> 00:27:47.149]  Or, oh, new world order, Barack Obama.
[00:27:47.689 --> 00:27:49.691]  And it's all a con game, folks.
[00:27:50.892 --> 00:27:54.915]  And they know InfoWars is breaking through and exposing their whole paradigm.
[00:27:54.955 --> 00:27:56.136]  So let's do a test right now.
[00:27:56.696 --> 00:27:58.898]  This will only have like 100,000 viewers when we're done, probably.
[00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.110]  Then 200, 300,000 by tomorrow.
[00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:01.850]  That sounds great.
[00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:02.251]  It's not.
[00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:05.851]  We used to do 3, 4 million on Facebook when they actually let our system work.
[00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:07.612]  Facebook mentions the way it's supposed to.
[00:28:07.812 --> 00:28:09.852]  Whether you like our page, it would show up on your page.
[00:28:10.172 --> 00:28:12.533]  So millions like our page, so millions could see it.
[00:28:12.773 --> 00:28:13.253]  Not anymore.
[00:28:13.553 --> 00:28:18.494]  But still, you can overpower them and send this link out by hand.
[00:28:18.974 --> 00:28:20.434]  Or post it on YouTube yourself.
[00:28:20.814 --> 00:28:21.815]  Or other platforms.
[00:28:21.855 --> 00:28:22.855]  That's how we're going to beat them.
[00:28:23.375 --> 00:28:27.276]  But they are trying to shut us down because we're showing the craziness of this.
[00:28:27.316 --> 00:28:27.756]  Let's go back.
[00:28:28.436 --> 00:28:33.738]  There's even articles I've got where they say religion and guns.
[00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:36.159]  And it says America has learned this from Putin.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.001]  America has learned about religion and guns from Putin.
[00:28:39.081 --> 00:28:42.142]  It's Russian to want guns and to want Christianity.
[00:28:43.042 --> 00:28:44.703]  The Soviet Union banned Christianity.
[00:28:45.083 --> 00:28:45.924]  People couldn't have guns.
[00:28:46.024 --> 00:28:46.804]  What the hell?
[00:28:47.064 --> 00:28:49.825]  I'm going to show you the Washington Post in a minute with that.
[00:28:49.845 --> 00:28:51.926]  Okay?
[00:28:52.567 --> 00:28:55.228]  So this is women's freedom to be a total slave.
[00:28:56.144 --> 00:28:56.964]  And to have no rights.
[00:28:57.504 --> 00:28:58.605]  And to have to wear a hood over your head.
[00:28:58.625 --> 00:29:01.125]  I mean, in the most Muslim countries, you have to wear a hood fully over.
[00:29:01.305 --> 00:29:02.006]  But she loves it.
[00:29:03.566 --> 00:29:07.167]  The FBI translator who went rogue and married an ISIS terrorist.
[00:29:07.987 --> 00:29:11.248]  Blonde lady, smart American, liberal, educated.
[00:29:12.228 --> 00:29:21.851]  She so fell in love with the ISIS guys that sell sex slaves into slavery, six-year-old girls, and murder people, and eat hearts, and kill all the Christians, that she had to go join it and give them secret documents.
[00:29:21.891 --> 00:29:22.211]  Here it is.
[00:29:24.765 --> 00:29:31.411]  See, he realizes, Anderson Cooper of the CIA, this is so trendy, he helped push, he's a Robert Barron heir worth billions, he pushed a whole system
[00:29:49.912 --> 00:30:01.280]  You're in the Arab Spring with Google and Facebook, admittedly running that, to overthrow secular governments in Libya, in Tunisia, in Egypt, in Syria, and trying in Syria.
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.184]  Remember when he was on the air celebrating, oh, the great liberty, blowing up the churches, killing all the gays?
[00:30:06.464 --> 00:30:07.244]  But that's okay!
[00:30:07.424 --> 00:30:08.925]  Put a hood over your head, it's feminist!
[00:30:09.166 --> 00:30:10.427]  Throw gays off buildings!
[00:30:11.207 --> 00:30:11.667]  It's trendy.
[00:30:11.947 --> 00:30:15.409]  I walked into Target today because one of my daughters wanted some toys they have there.
[00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:20.032]  And I saw two really funny gay guys.
[00:30:20.052 --> 00:30:21.473]  And when I say funny, I don't care if they're gay.
[00:30:22.093 --> 00:30:29.357]  My son was with me and he says they look like Barney Rubble and, uh, Barney Rubble and Fred Flintstone.
[00:30:29.377 --> 00:30:32.959]  Because they literally look stocky and one looked like Fred Flintstone and one looked like Barney.
[00:30:33.319 --> 00:30:35.240]  And they stopped at the door and pointed at me and laughed.
[00:30:35.841 --> 00:30:37.582]  And I kind of walked through and they went, oh, look, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:38.282]  Ha, I started laughing.
[00:30:38.502 --> 00:30:39.803]  And I walked over and I said, hey, how you doing?
[00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:41.019]  I don't know.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.601]  It was they thought laughing at me.
[00:31:04.861 --> 00:31:05.942]  Oh look!
[00:31:06.222 --> 00:31:06.923]  That's their identity.
[00:31:07.023 --> 00:31:07.683]  Oh we're trendies.
[00:31:09.364 --> 00:31:11.065]  You're what we say you are.
[00:31:11.105 --> 00:31:12.607]  You're the crazy right-wing nut.
[00:31:12.647 --> 00:31:13.067]  No I'm not.
[00:31:13.687 --> 00:31:14.047]  No I'm not.
[00:31:14.408 --> 00:31:15.048]  I'm researched.
[00:31:15.288 --> 00:31:16.709]  I've read hundreds of books on propaganda.
[00:31:16.889 --> 00:31:18.050]  Military warfare manuals.
[00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:18.931]  I've been studying this.
[00:31:18.951 --> 00:31:20.552]  I've been on air since I was 21 years old.
[00:31:21.072 --> 00:31:23.014]  I reach some weeks 85 million people a week.
[00:31:23.054 --> 00:31:24.795]  Most weeks 40, 50, 60 million.
[00:31:25.055 --> 00:31:26.036]  Okay we're changing the world.
[00:31:26.276 --> 00:31:30.879]  I'm being attacked by every major TV station and every major comic and late-night show because there's
[00:31:30.879 --> 00:31:32.941]  You're scared of what we're doing and what our listeners are doing.
[00:31:33.481 --> 00:31:34.342]  We're under attack.
[00:31:34.862 --> 00:31:35.303]  That's why.
[00:31:35.743 --> 00:31:36.664]  Because we're telling the truth.
[00:31:36.984 --> 00:31:38.205]  And I care about those guys.
[00:31:38.745 --> 00:31:40.687]  I don't care what they're doing in their own private lives.
[00:31:40.907 --> 00:31:44.470]  That's a globalist lie that your identity is so cool that I'm attacking it.
[00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:51.076]  So you follow your corporate identity it gave you and watch the TV shows where you're trendy and cool and I'm the heretic.
[00:31:51.116 --> 00:31:55.299]  You're like super crazy right-wing Christians pointing at somebody and saying their skirt's too short.
[00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:55.840]  Here we go.
[00:31:57.021 --> 00:31:59.603]  I'm not the one obsessed with how you dress or what you do in your life.
[00:31:59.983 --> 00:32:02.886]  You're projecting onto me who I am and the feeling good.
[00:32:03.246 --> 00:32:04.087]  Now, this is what's crazy.
[00:32:04.267 --> 00:32:06.008]  David and I talked about this today, and I'd forgotten about this.
[00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:07.770]  Robert Duvall's in the first making of it.
[00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:08.751]  Great film.
[00:32:08.791 --> 00:32:10.192]  The Handmaiden's Tale.
[00:32:11.193 --> 00:32:17.118]  This is where right-wingers take over, and they make all of the people
[00:32:19.258 --> 00:32:20.519]  Look at his daughters.
[00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:21.860]  Look at his wife.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:22.200]  Total BS!
[00:32:48.373 --> 00:32:49.614]  The guy has beauty pageants.
[00:32:49.994 --> 00:32:52.315]  But see, Trump, they admit this movie's based on Trump.
[00:32:52.815 --> 00:32:58.878]  Like the new Escape from New York movie that's coming out that's like, you know, China attacks because Trump's a dictator and they take him out and all this crap.
[00:32:59.759 --> 00:33:01.920]  The guy with the Transformers is doing that.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:02.980]  Bay.
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:03.421]  Michael Bay.
[00:33:03.541 --> 00:33:04.201]  Yeah, Michael Bay.
[00:33:05.061 --> 00:33:06.202]  This isn't reality.
[00:33:06.282 --> 00:33:07.983]  The hijab is the mark of slavery.
[00:33:09.223 --> 00:33:11.605]  Right-wingers aren't making you wear hoods over your heads.
[00:33:11.645 --> 00:33:12.245]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:33:12.385 --> 00:33:15.046]  They have a movie coming out where we're all scared it's the case.
[00:33:15.327 --> 00:33:17.948]  All it's the Democrats opening up Europe, bringing in all these people.
[00:33:19.631 --> 00:33:20.751]  Openly working to do it.
[00:33:20.771 --> 00:33:23.272]  So let's... Here's the trailer for The Handmaid's Tale.
[00:33:23.552 --> 00:33:24.493]  The new one coming out.
[00:33:25.153 --> 00:33:25.593]  Watch this.
[00:33:27.294 --> 00:33:28.174]  I was asleep before.
[00:33:28.194 --> 00:33:29.734]  That's how we let it happen.
[00:33:30.255 --> 00:33:32.735]  When they slaughtered Congress, we didn't wake up.
[00:33:33.316 --> 00:33:38.497]  When they blamed terrorists and suspended the Constitution, we didn't wake up then either.
[00:33:39.478 --> 00:33:40.018]  Now I'm awake.
[00:33:43.257 --> 00:33:44.337]  My name is Offred.
[00:33:44.518 --> 00:33:45.718]  I had another name.
[00:33:46.078 --> 00:33:48.299]  Ladies, I have to let you go.
[00:33:48.379 --> 00:33:49.580]  It's the law now.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.180]  They needed to do it this way.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.362]  All the bank accounts and the jobs all at the same time.
[00:33:54.442 --> 00:33:57.483]  You guys in the airports otherwise?
[00:33:57.663 --> 00:33:59.084]  Yeah, perfect!
[00:33:59.144 --> 00:34:01.024]  Oh, please, it's a secret!
[00:34:01.044 --> 00:34:01.825]  No, yeah!
[00:34:05.831 --> 00:34:10.314]  You girls will serve the leaders and their barren wives.
[00:34:10.735 --> 00:34:16.239]  You will bear children for them.
[00:34:19.501 --> 00:34:23.864]  There's an eye in your house.
[00:34:24.184 --> 00:34:25.586]  We'll send you to the colonies.
[00:34:25.626 --> 00:34:28.548]  You'll be cleaning up toxic waste in the delta.
[00:34:31.016 --> 00:34:36.138]  Tonight is a celebration of Gilead and of what we have achieved.
[00:34:36.198 --> 00:34:38.779]  We only wanted to make the world better.
[00:34:38.839 --> 00:34:39.419]  Better?
[00:34:39.479 --> 00:34:42.220]  Better never means better for everyone.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.301]  I want to keep on living for her.
[00:34:44.361 --> 00:34:45.902]  Remember your scripture.
[00:34:45.922 --> 00:34:49.223]  Blessed are the meek.
[00:34:49.903 --> 00:34:54.825]  And blessed are those who suffer for the cause of righteousness.
[00:35:00.171 --> 00:35:01.231]  So, there you go.
[00:35:01.331 --> 00:35:02.832]  Total inversion of reality.
[00:35:03.532 --> 00:35:05.093]  Ladies and gentlemen, here's Handmaid's Tale.
[00:35:06.313 --> 00:35:08.794]  There's no Christians making anybody do that.
[00:35:10.154 --> 00:35:12.435]  Why, that's a hajib light, not even a burqa.
[00:35:14.176 --> 00:35:16.237]  And I meant to pull up that last article.
[00:35:16.257 --> 00:35:17.657]  Let me pull that up.
[00:35:18.377 --> 00:35:19.798]  Let me just show people this right here.
[00:35:19.818 --> 00:35:22.979]  Let me type in, religion and guns.
[00:35:31.101 --> 00:35:33.263]  Washington Post, total inversion of reality.
[00:35:34.063 --> 00:35:38.207]  Guns and religion, how America conservatives are getting closer to Putin's Russia.
[00:35:39.147 --> 00:35:43.931]  So now you see, if you're pro-gun or pro-Christian, you're basically with Russia.
[00:35:44.331 --> 00:35:51.097]  And the reason we have a Second Amendment is the Russians, Putin, went in a time machine back to 1776 and did all that.
[00:35:51.997 --> 00:35:54.019]  No, Russia has become more Christian and more pro-gun.
[00:35:58.379 --> 00:35:59.179]  And I've learned one thing.
[00:35:59.239 --> 00:35:59.880]  I've been threatened.
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:03.261]  I've gotten a lot of calls from powerful people, and they told me, you're going to be destroyed.
[00:36:04.182 --> 00:36:05.062]  You're going to be shut down.
[00:36:05.082 --> 00:36:10.085]  I have a member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York that runs the Fed suing me right now.
[00:36:10.765 --> 00:36:12.686]  Conservative news praising and saying, shut me down.
[00:36:14.107 --> 00:36:20.450]  I have George Soros' law firm, the one he founded, who was the first client, suing me, Democratic Party.
[00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:21.911]  We're going to defeat them.
[00:36:21.931 --> 00:36:22.671]  It's a terrible case.
[00:36:22.711 --> 00:36:25.953]  But see, they're just demonizing me in the news before they do other stuff.
[00:36:26.293 --> 00:36:27.614]  This is all just to say I'm fake.
[00:36:28.752 --> 00:36:31.875]  As I sit here and beg people, don't be conned.
[00:36:32.135 --> 00:36:33.116]  They think you're idiots.
[00:36:33.497 --> 00:36:36.139]  They think they're selling Islam everywhere.
[00:36:36.159 --> 00:36:41.905]  And I used to hear right-wingers 15 years ago say, oh, Islam's taking over Caliphate, Turkey's really going to turn against Europe.
[00:36:42.105 --> 00:36:43.226]  And I was like, that's a bunch of bull.
[00:36:43.266 --> 00:36:53.175]  And now they announced the Caliphate two weeks ago, voted in martial law, basically suspended their constitution by a vote, are setting up an Islamic state, threatening to burn down Europe if they don't give in to Islam.
[00:36:54.196 --> 00:36:58.298]  The Germans have brought in five million people in the last five, six years.
[00:36:58.318 --> 00:36:59.938]  There's like six, seven million total in Europe.
[00:36:59.958 --> 00:37:01.159]  Most of them are military-age men.
[00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:02.239]  They're not even vetting them.
[00:37:02.259 --> 00:37:03.200]  They're not even checking them.
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:09.322]  And then I say this Chobani yogurt owner guy is openly with Soros promoting bringing in unvetted refugees.
[00:37:09.902 --> 00:37:11.043]  He says, oh, they are vetted.
[00:37:11.083 --> 00:37:12.123]  The State Department does it.
[00:37:12.944 --> 00:37:16.045]  But they're from seven countries that give out fake passports to anybody.
[00:37:17.227 --> 00:37:22.194]  Then they attack us, and you go, oh, statistically only killed a couple hundred in the last year in France, and this and that.
[00:37:22.214 --> 00:37:26.441]  The point is they're bringing in incompatible, oppressive people that want to destroy the West.
[00:37:27.677 --> 00:37:30.459]  And doctors and lawyers and heretics that are escaping Islam.
[00:37:30.659 --> 00:37:33.422]  Some of the earlier Islamic waves that came in are heretics.
[00:37:33.442 --> 00:37:34.262]  They're good people.
[00:37:35.143 --> 00:37:36.224]  They want to live in a free country.
[00:37:36.784 --> 00:37:45.431]  But I don't get how the most anti-American, anti-free, anti-Christian, anti-Renaissance groups are running around and the media acts like it's no big deal.
[00:37:46.292 --> 00:37:52.897]  And then Facebook comes out and it's targeting young people, targeting trendies, who feel like they're alone and giving them fake liberal culture.
[00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:53.838]  It's not real liberal.
[00:37:55.319 --> 00:37:58.783]  Banning whiteboards in colleges because somebody might write something bad on them is not liberal.
[00:38:00.644 --> 00:38:04.869]  Banning Halloween and costume parties and fiesta parties because someone might be offended.
[00:38:05.129 --> 00:38:06.230]  Cultural appropriation.
[00:38:07.071 --> 00:38:09.894]  Saying Oriental food is not racist.
[00:38:10.234 --> 00:38:10.815]  I was reading about it.
[00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:17.593]  San Francisco, there's an old Chinese restaurant, it was called like the Orient or Oriental, and people were trying to make the Chinese change the name.
[00:38:18.093 --> 00:38:19.975]  Oriental just means the Orient!
[00:38:20.575 --> 00:38:28.900]  Like, and then they say, well, don't call people Orient as if being in the Orient, the thousand-year-old name for it, is bad, was seen as quality.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.282]  They go, don't call it Asia by geographically.
[00:38:32.462 --> 00:38:34.823]  It's about making you use what words they want.
[00:38:35.564 --> 00:38:39.586]  It's about controlling you, like saying, this is white power.
[00:38:39.646 --> 00:38:40.046]  No, it's not.
[00:38:40.066 --> 00:38:40.947]  It means A-OK.
[00:38:41.937 --> 00:38:43.358]  To do this means the best.
[00:38:43.858 --> 00:38:44.119]  Food.
[00:38:44.539 --> 00:38:45.119]  French cuisine.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:45.900]  Thai cuisine.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:46.841]  Hundreds of years.
[00:38:48.242 --> 00:38:49.963]  This means warding off the devil.
[00:38:50.944 --> 00:38:51.344]  In Europe.
[00:38:51.704 --> 00:38:52.785]  Over a thousand years old.
[00:38:53.145 --> 00:38:53.806]  The first writings.
[00:38:54.206 --> 00:38:55.167]  Doesn't mean you love Satan.
[00:38:55.507 --> 00:38:56.548]  This means you love Satan.
[00:38:56.768 --> 00:38:57.989]  People take that and say, I said that.
[00:38:58.149 --> 00:38:58.790]  Showing you symbols.
[00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:00.171]  That's how they deceive online.
[00:39:00.811 --> 00:39:02.032]  Learn what symbols really mean.
[00:39:02.092 --> 00:39:03.053]  It's okay to use them.
[00:39:03.293 --> 00:39:04.254]  It's okay to know them.
[00:39:05.375 --> 00:39:06.876]  It's okay to be aware of what's happening.
[00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:11.310]  But this is the reality.
[00:39:12.113 --> 00:39:13.076]  And you're being lied to.
[00:39:13.116 --> 00:39:13.938]  You're being conned.
[00:39:15.017 --> 00:39:20.819]  And I see the tremendous racism and classism that they've replaced, because racism works, saying white males are evil.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.280]  There's only 3% of the world white males.
[00:39:23.641 --> 00:39:25.181]  It's a bunch of white males running globalism.
[00:39:25.201 --> 00:39:29.843]  They're the ones selling this whole liberal system, so the third world never gets the West, never gets freedom.
[00:39:30.684 --> 00:39:37.386]  The globalists use the third world they've enslaved to weigh down the West, to drive down wages, to bring in political movements and balkanize society.
[00:39:37.506 --> 00:39:40.027]  And that's in all their own admissions, their own documents.
[00:39:40.468 --> 00:39:40.868]  That's why
[00:39:42.386 --> 00:39:45.110]  Peter Sutherland and the UN Refugee Board is doing this.
[00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:46.252]  This is a plan.
[00:39:46.292 --> 00:39:49.136]  This is 21st century warfare, and I'm begging all of you.
[00:39:50.638 --> 00:39:52.460]  You know the parable of the prodigal son.
[00:39:54.008 --> 00:40:00.911]  He has the good son that runs the farm, runs the winery, runs the vineyard, runs the cattle, runs the sheep, runs the goats.
[00:40:01.231 --> 00:40:02.011]  He's an older son.
[00:40:02.071 --> 00:40:02.672]  He stayed home.
[00:40:02.712 --> 00:40:03.212]  He did great.
[00:40:03.452 --> 00:40:04.252]  He has his family.
[00:40:04.452 --> 00:40:07.754]  The young son runs off for a decade, demands his inheritance.
[00:40:07.794 --> 00:40:10.175]  His father gives him half the money the family has.
[00:40:10.615 --> 00:40:13.036]  He runs off and all these fake friends screw him over.
[00:40:13.316 --> 00:40:15.597]  Prostitutes, drugs, you know, alcohol.
[00:40:16.057 --> 00:40:17.778]  And he comes back finally with nothing.
[00:40:17.798 --> 00:40:20.359]  And his father says, slaughter the best calf we've got.
[00:40:20.459 --> 00:40:21.139]  Have a feast.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.260]  My son's home.
[00:40:27.622 --> 00:40:29.043]  I never did anything to you.
[00:40:29.163 --> 00:40:30.984]  All I did was bust my ass and be true.
[00:40:31.405 --> 00:40:33.126]  And you've not been throwing parties for me like this.
[00:40:33.146 --> 00:40:37.769]  And the father says, this is your lesser brother.
[00:40:37.929 --> 00:40:39.890]  Of course he's lesser and weaker than you.
[00:40:40.751 --> 00:40:41.931]  Imagine how much I love you.
[00:40:42.232 --> 00:40:44.213]  We don't need to throw parties to know how great you are.
[00:40:44.833 --> 00:40:46.214]  You're going to run this house.
[00:40:46.234 --> 00:40:47.455]  You're going to inherit everything.
[00:40:48.136 --> 00:40:50.577]  Thank God your brother's not dead, not a complete failure.
[00:40:51.518 --> 00:40:52.919]  I care about Trendy's.
[00:40:54.667 --> 00:40:55.467]  You're in a cult.
[00:40:56.228 --> 00:40:57.468]  They call you dumbasses.
[00:40:57.488 --> 00:40:58.489]  They laugh at you.
[00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:03.912]  You've been chemically hit by birth and positronically hit by the television from birth.
[00:41:04.592 --> 00:41:06.033]  You can get through it, though.
[00:41:06.073 --> 00:41:07.013]  You can come out of it.
[00:41:07.494 --> 00:41:08.734]  You don't have to think it's funny.
[00:41:08.754 --> 00:41:12.176]  You don't have to be like those archetypes in The Last Man Alive, The Last Man
[00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:21.074]  The third remake, the allegory I use, where he finds out he's immune from being like the undead.
[00:41:21.274 --> 00:41:24.496]  Most of them are zombies, but a few are like this upper class that keep their minds.
[00:41:25.256 --> 00:41:26.957]  He learns his blood is the antidote.
[00:41:26.977 --> 00:41:27.818]  He's got the antibodies.
[00:41:28.338 --> 00:41:31.880]  Then he goes to them and he says, I've got the antidote right here.
[00:41:32.401 --> 00:41:33.521]  We can restart humanity.
[00:41:33.561 --> 00:41:34.722]  We don't have to be under their control.
[00:41:35.182 --> 00:41:38.344]  And they take a spear and they say, buddy, we like just how we are.
[00:41:39.285 --> 00:41:39.865]  Right in his heart.
[00:41:40.786 --> 00:41:41.726]  We already changed.
[00:41:41.786 --> 00:41:42.507]  We already like it.
[00:41:44.002 --> 00:41:44.943]  We don't like humanity?
[00:41:45.083 --> 00:41:48.386]  We want to roll over and die so Zuckerberg and Bill Gates can play God.
[00:41:48.567 --> 00:41:49.127]  We like it!
[00:41:49.828 --> 00:41:51.189]  Because they made us feel powerful!
[00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:52.731]  They programmed us!
[00:41:53.532 --> 00:41:57.496]  Even though we're failures and pathetic, we don't care because we get to imagine we're powerful.
[00:41:58.617 --> 00:42:07.226]  And they hate my spirit because they know I care about you, they know I care about myself, they know I don't want to be conned, I hate their spirit of evil and oppression, and I want to CRUSH THEM!
[00:42:08.342 --> 00:42:11.923]  And I've got the energy and the will that I know you've got inside as well.
[00:42:11.943 --> 00:42:15.744]  Just like a candle, I can light you on fire, and you can light others on fire.
[00:42:16.844 --> 00:42:21.045]  They said Rush fires the minds of men and women everywhere, but you've gotta want it.
[00:42:21.505 --> 00:42:22.726]  The language is under attack.
[00:42:22.966 --> 00:42:24.106]  The culture is under attack.
[00:42:24.626 --> 00:42:28.507]  We're statistically getting dumber and sicker, and cancer is way off the charts.
[00:42:28.547 --> 00:42:29.268]  We all know this.
[00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:33.549]  I told you they had in the 60s cyborg cats and dogs.
[00:42:33.569 --> 00:42:34.569]  It was declassified today.
[00:42:36.147 --> 00:42:39.689]  I had family that I tried to hire who were involved in implants to go do it in the 80s.
[00:42:39.989 --> 00:42:40.329]  My dad.
[00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:43.011]  To the news today, see?
[00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:43.931]  It's like I told you.
[00:42:43.991 --> 00:42:45.392]  Cameras, microphones watching you.
[00:42:46.353 --> 00:42:47.513]  Data down power lines.
[00:42:48.053 --> 00:42:49.974]  Light bulbs flickering, communicating with the computers.
[00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:50.635]  It's all public!
[00:42:51.707 --> 00:42:56.813]  I was at a press conference Friday, and I said, don't you understand they have human-animal clones?
[00:42:57.413 --> 00:42:59.215]  Don't you understand genetic engineering?
[00:42:59.776 --> 00:43:01.157]  Everybody's already getting sick from it.
[00:43:01.197 --> 00:43:03.119]  It's causing all these mutagenic viruses.
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.062]  Cancer is up 10,000% in children.
[00:43:05.462 --> 00:43:08.285]  And they all, ABC, NBC, CBS, they all
[00:43:17.694 --> 00:43:19.235]  We're going to bring him down soon.
[00:43:19.255 --> 00:43:22.576]  We even have some of the videos that are like, yeah, yeah, that piece of crap.
[00:43:23.737 --> 00:43:26.058]  And I realize they just love their little job from the system.
[00:43:26.078 --> 00:43:29.840]  They love being part of the power structure, feeling like it's all behind them.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.341]  And ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm with the big government.
[00:43:32.381 --> 00:43:33.622]  I'm with the big NSM.
[00:43:34.382 --> 00:43:36.483]  And they're getting hit with all the same stuff.
[00:43:37.719 --> 00:43:41.627]  And everything I talk about, world government, globalism, it's all out in the open now, isn't it?
[00:43:42.328 --> 00:43:46.316]  To household word, should we have a big corporate private world government running things?
[00:43:46.998 --> 00:43:47.799]  Thought it didn't exist!
[00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:50.553]  I want humanity to make it.
[00:43:51.033 --> 00:43:54.934]  And those of you that have been conned by all the Trinity garbage need to wake up and break through and understand it.
[00:43:55.214 --> 00:43:57.595]  And understand why I'm under attack as much as Trump is.
[00:43:57.855 --> 00:43:58.955]  Trump's already starting to go sideways.
[00:43:59.575 --> 00:44:01.016]  They've gotten those around him to break.
[00:44:01.436 --> 00:44:07.237]  He's still doing some good, getting his jobs, stabilizing things, but he's going sideways because it's hard to go against this.
[00:44:07.477 --> 00:44:08.898]  The bullying, the intimidation.
[00:44:09.178 --> 00:44:14.219]  And most people are such cowards that when they get bullied, when they get intimidated,
[00:44:15.461 --> 00:44:20.444]  Most people are in that position where they lie to themselves and they don't say, oh, I'm a coward.
[00:44:20.464 --> 00:44:21.925]  I'm going to be a conformist and go along.
[00:44:22.246 --> 00:44:23.607]  They go, no, you're the bad man.
[00:44:23.807 --> 00:44:24.307]  You're the cook.
[00:44:24.527 --> 00:44:25.088]  You're the fake.
[00:44:25.288 --> 00:44:25.948]  You're the actor.
[00:44:26.088 --> 00:44:26.869]  You're the cult leader.
[00:44:27.029 --> 00:44:27.729]  You're the racist.
[00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:31.232]  You're the one that doesn't want your daughters to ever be professionals.
[00:44:32.032 --> 00:44:33.674]  I was accused of that in court.
[00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:36.691]  With no clips, no proof, no nothing.
[00:44:37.312 --> 00:44:41.675]  That man doesn't want his children to ever be able to go and be judges.
[00:44:41.695 --> 00:44:44.177]  He doesn't want his daughters to be doctors.
[00:44:44.637 --> 00:44:45.438]  Total lies!
[00:44:45.718 --> 00:44:52.323]  But it doesn't matter because it makes the conformist feel good and strong to use those magic words the corporate media taught you.
[00:44:52.603 --> 00:44:56.505]  Racism, sexism, homophobia, all these things that become all that matter.
[00:44:56.925 --> 00:45:00.167]  And even though you're not fighting any of those things, it doesn't matter.
[00:45:00.307 --> 00:45:05.390]  They invoke it, and they say it, and then people get it, and they use it, and that's their identity.
[00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:07.391]  It's a couple of terms you run around and use.
[00:45:07.571 --> 00:45:12.753]  You have no family, you have no future, you have no honor, you have no will, you have no understanding of history.
[00:45:12.934 --> 00:45:17.856]  You just worship the system, and the mainstream television, and the latest downloads you get every day from it.
[00:45:18.576 --> 00:45:19.417]  Over and over again.
[00:45:20.497 --> 00:45:21.158]  Year after year.
[00:45:22.782 --> 00:45:29.763]  Decade after decade, and you can just see the accelerated destruction of reality, where they wage war on common sense deliberately.
[00:45:29.783 --> 00:45:31.024]  I'm out of time.
[00:45:31.044 --> 00:45:32.304]  I'm gonna spend some time with my family.
[00:45:32.724 --> 00:45:34.524]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:45:34.984 --> 00:45:41.685]  The enemy... The enemy is hitting us right now with everything they've got.
[00:45:42.566 --> 00:45:49.707]  And they're doing it because they know we have the life force, we have the will, we have an understanding of the globalist plan,
[00:45:51.149 --> 00:45:53.770]  And they know the military, police, and a lot of intellectuals are listening.
[00:45:54.371 --> 00:46:00.233]  And that's why they want to try to destroy me so that others get scared and don't stand up and speak out because we're at a tipping point.
[00:46:00.293 --> 00:46:00.834]  We're winning.
[00:46:01.534 --> 00:46:07.537]  And despite all these massive attacks and all these things that are happening, we're getting bigger, we're getting stronger.
[00:46:07.577 --> 00:46:09.158]  Thanks to your prayers and your support.
[00:46:09.518 --> 00:46:13.140]  I'm Alex Jones signing off until tonight, 7 o'clock and tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.160]  InfoWars.com.
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.081]  For our own feeds, the
[00:46:18.354 --> 00:46:18.775]  We're good.
[00:46:38.183 --> 00:46:44.186]  He's preying on you to be a trendy, to make you want to be a conformist under peer pressure, and you don't have to do that.
[00:46:44.306 --> 00:46:47.968]  You can follow history, your gut, research, and what you know is right.
[00:46:48.209 --> 00:46:48.589]  Do that.
[00:46:48.729 --> 00:46:52.191]  Don't follow these corrupt level of systems that could care less about you.
[00:46:52.371 --> 00:46:58.154]  In fact, they want you diverted, and entertained, and half dead out of the way, so you sleep while they live.
[00:47:01.196 --> 00:47:04.378]  You love to fight!
[00:47:04.398 --> 00:47:05.418]  You're getting it!
[00:47:05.438 --> 00:47:06.359]  You're getting it!
[00:47:21.926 --> 00:47:23.807]  I joke around a lot on the air.
[00:47:23.967 --> 00:47:24.888]  I try to have a good time.
[00:47:25.508 --> 00:47:26.669]  I'm a happy person overall.
[00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:35.113]  But I have intellectually studied the globalist program and I understand it is a major threat to myself and my family and your family as well.
[00:47:36.114 --> 00:47:40.837]  Now we do have some gallows humor around here, but when you get down to the bedrock of our message, it's dire.
[00:47:41.837 --> 00:47:44.699]  Globalism is an anti-human system.
[00:47:44.979 --> 00:47:46.340]  It's a breakaway civilization.
[00:47:47.403 --> 00:47:58.467]  The elites believe humanity's finished and are basically stealing our wealth, our intellectual property, and our very essence to construct their new world order system.
[00:47:59.568 --> 00:48:03.109]  Now, I never started Infowars 22 years ago believing I would save the world.
[00:48:03.389 --> 00:48:04.850]  I just wanted to be a watchman on the wall.
[00:48:06.058 --> 00:48:13.423]  A modern Paul Revere who could warn people about the threats, and I believe that humanity, when faced with a threat, would take action against it.
[00:48:14.083 --> 00:48:19.267]  So many times globalists would tell me that, oh Alex, they're a bunch of cowards, you're just scaring them for us.
[00:48:19.847 --> 00:48:29.473]  And I would always say, no, humanity, at least a large part of it, when faced with the truth, will do what it takes to defeat your unelected planetary dictatorship.
[00:48:30.094 --> 00:48:32.776]  Wednesday, May 3rd, and Thursday, May 4th,
[00:48:33.516 --> 00:48:37.317]  We're doing a 30-hour transmission that kicked off at 11 a.m.
[00:48:37.738 --> 00:48:38.238]  on Wednesday.
[00:48:39.258 --> 00:48:43.940]  And we've got Congressman Ron Paul and so many other amazing patriots joining us.
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:50.102]  I hope that you'll do several things during this important transmission to defend free speech and defend what's left of the West.
[00:48:50.702 --> 00:49:02.107]  I hope you'll spread the link at Infowars.com forward slash show to new people who've never heard of the show or who have heard of us being demonized in the national news but have not actually heard the message.
[00:49:02.927 --> 00:49:05.129]  Tell people, this is the forbidden message.
[00:49:05.449 --> 00:49:07.110]  This is the show they don't want you to hear.
[00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:09.572]  This is the show the globalists are afraid of.
[00:49:09.952 --> 00:49:14.936]  That's why they're trying to assassinate my character, my crew's character, and the rest of our host's character.
[00:49:15.196 --> 00:49:20.080]  Because they understand we're promoting freedom, open society, goodwill.
[00:49:21.021 --> 00:49:23.403]  The globalists are selling division and evil.
[00:49:23.823 --> 00:49:27.546]  So please spread the word about the live transmission so we can reach new people.
[00:49:27.606 --> 00:49:28.146]  That's the goal.
[00:49:28.287 --> 00:49:30.408]  Will this 30-hour broadcast save the world?
[00:49:30.468 --> 00:49:30.688]  No.
[00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:36.713]  But it is the spirit of defiance and the incremental march against tyranny that overall will save the world.
[00:49:37.193 --> 00:49:41.156]  My friends, we can come together as one human race that bleeds red blood.
[00:49:41.957 --> 00:49:42.117]  Okay.
[00:49:56.954 --> 00:49:59.815]  And also financially support us because that's what funds us.
[00:50:00.135 --> 00:50:10.539]  We don't have George Soros or the Ford Foundation or the federal government funding us like MSNBC and CNN or the Saudis and the Mexican kingpin Carlos Slim funding the New York Times.
[00:50:11.019 --> 00:50:25.625]  We have people like you buying Molon Labe t-shirts and high quality non-GMO heirloom seed banks to plant summer and fall gardens and high quality water filtration systems that are the very best out there at the lowest prices.
[00:50:26.065 --> 00:50:30.748]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products at infowarestore.com.
[00:50:31.048 --> 00:50:36.511]  We have a huge line of nutraceuticals, many of which are household names that we've private-labeled at lower prices.
[00:50:36.531 --> 00:50:38.192]  A lot of stuff that Whole Foods carries.
[00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:44.696]  And many of which I've developed with top producers, scientists, and researchers, like Knockout, our amazing sleep aid.
[00:50:45.116 --> 00:50:55.302]  And when you purchase these products, it funds what we're doing and really puts a stick in the eye of the globalists like George Soros and others that are doing everything they can right now to shut us down.
[00:50:55.782 --> 00:50:58.344]  The law firm George Soros funded is suing me right now.
[00:50:58.824 --> 00:51:01.806]  A member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York is suing me right now.
[00:51:02.186 --> 00:51:08.730]  The globalists are doing everything they can to silence us and to demonize me and to destroy my family, quite frankly.
[00:51:09.931 --> 00:51:14.814]  But they're following the arrogance of the elite that has brought them down throughout history.
[00:51:15.174 --> 00:51:17.035]  Because the world sees the attacks.
[00:51:17.095 --> 00:51:17.896]  They see the lies.
[00:51:18.236 --> 00:51:19.337]  They see the demonization.
[00:51:20.117 --> 00:51:23.920]  And so we've never had more visitors, more traffic than InfoWars.com.
[00:51:25.578 --> 00:51:34.386]  The problem is the attacks are sustained, they're intensifying, and so even though we're growing, it's not quite fast enough to be able to defeat their attack profile.
[00:51:34.786 --> 00:51:45.755]  So that's why I'm asking you to double down so they see us really grow, not just stay the same, and understand that their attempts to shut us down will be met with total resolve and commitment.
[00:51:46.176 --> 00:51:51.340]  We have huge specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:51:52.581 --> 00:51:55.923]  On hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products that's a win-win.
[00:51:56.063 --> 00:52:01.165]  Products you need, products that fund our operation, so that we can then expose the globalist program.
[00:52:01.245 --> 00:52:03.186]  It's a total 360 win.
[00:52:03.627 --> 00:52:06.288]  A limited time, DNA Force is now back in stock.
[00:52:06.768 --> 00:52:12.571]  We have the Defend Free Speech Mega Special getting Brain Force, our best-selling nootropic, for 30% off.
[00:52:12.931 --> 00:52:14.812]  We have Secret 12 at 20% off.
[00:52:15.172 --> 00:52:17.314]  We have Living Defense, a parasite cleanse, 20% off.
[00:52:18.294 --> 00:52:21.177]  Biome Defense, our great probiotic, 25% off.
[00:52:21.577 --> 00:52:24.520]  Bio PCA for skin and nails, top formula.
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.503]  Other formulas that are similar cost 60, 70 bucks, two, three times what ours does.
[00:52:28.824 --> 00:52:30.645]  Prostagard, incredible formula.
[00:52:31.126 --> 00:52:35.130]  Winter Sun, the knockout that I mentioned, and so many other great products.
[00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:36.751]  And then finally, let me see if it's still here.
[00:52:36.891 --> 00:52:37.131]  It is.
[00:52:37.532 --> 00:52:40.014]  This just came back in after two months being sold out.
[00:52:40.434 --> 00:52:43.677]  Super blue, high quality, organic toothpaste.
[00:52:44.418 --> 00:52:49.442]  Fluoride-free, with iodine, with colloidal silver, with tea tree oil and peppermint oil.
[00:52:49.783 --> 00:52:50.683]  It's concentrated.
[00:52:50.723 --> 00:52:53.546]  My dad is a quasi-retired dentist, oral surgeon.
[00:52:53.806 --> 00:52:56.989]  He helped develop this with one of the biggest manufacturers in the country.
[00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.809]  It's amazing.
[00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:01.833]  And again, when you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off.
[00:53:01.933 --> 00:53:02.553]  It's a win-win.
[00:53:03.014 --> 00:53:06.897]  You remember to support us each month, or every two months, or every three months, however you sign up.
[00:53:07.297 --> 00:53:10.020]  You can cancel anytime, and you can get 10% off, and then
[00:53:11.741 --> 00:53:18.224]  Don't have to remember to keep supporting us and also get the products that obviously run out that you've got to replenish.
[00:53:18.465 --> 00:53:20.005]  These are great renewable resources.
[00:53:20.326 --> 00:53:21.446]  Please continue to support us.
[00:53:21.526 --> 00:53:24.008]  Again, I want to defeat the globalists.
[00:53:24.088 --> 00:53:24.728]  I'm determined.
[00:53:24.808 --> 00:53:25.348]  I'm focused.
[00:53:25.889 --> 00:53:33.793]  But without you spreading the word, without you financially supporting us, and without you praying for us, we don't have a chance in hell.
[00:53:34.193 --> 00:53:35.974]  But if you get behind us like you've already done,
[00:53:37.619 --> 00:53:38.540]  Turn it up a notch?
[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:42.763]  We are unstoppable, ladies and gentlemen, because humans want freedom.
[00:53:43.083 --> 00:53:45.385]  We want to have a shared destiny together.
[00:53:45.625 --> 00:53:46.806]  We want to go to the stars.
[00:53:47.206 --> 00:53:48.447]  Look how far we've already come.
[00:53:48.707 --> 00:53:50.428]  So let's tell the globalists we're not trash.
[00:53:50.729 --> 00:53:53.731]  Let's tell Bill Guy, the science guy, that we're going to have more than one child.
[00:53:54.011 --> 00:53:57.013]  Let's tell David Rockefeller that, you know, we're not subhumans.
[00:53:57.313 --> 00:54:01.517]  Let's tell Ted Turner, who could have five kids, but tells us we're subhuman, he can go to hell.
[00:54:01.837 --> 00:54:03.078]  And let's take action.
[00:54:03.578 --> 00:54:11.715]  There's nowhere you can spend your hard-earned money to get better products and then make sure that money goes to a good cause than InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:54:11.955 --> 00:54:13.278]  But regardless of what you do...
[00:54:14.264 --> 00:54:24.771]  Spread the links, spread the articles, and let people know about this 30-hour special broadcast so new people tune in and learn about the nightly news, the daily show I do, and the news sites and everything we're engaged in.
[00:54:24.811 --> 00:54:30.194]  Because we're not perfect, but our hearts are in the right place and we are pulling as hard as we can for victory.
[00:54:30.655 --> 00:54:39.020]  Now back to the live transmission with the amazing host and guest and special reports during the 30-hour broadcast that we're now partway into.
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.862]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:54:42.142 --> 00:54:43.383]  Please spread that link.
[00:54:44.444 --> 00:54:46.636]  That's right, we're almost nine hours in right now.
[00:54:46.656 --> 00:54:47.763]  We'll be here for the next few hours.
[00:54:49.921 --> 00:54:52.503]  Of course, I've got Owen Schroyer here with me right now.
[00:54:52.543 --> 00:54:59.647]  We've got Anthony Cumia, legendary talk show host, censored more than even Howard Stern for his conservative statements, by the way.
[00:55:00.087 --> 00:55:02.748]  Cuss words are okay, I guess, on talk radio, but not conservatism.
[00:55:03.149 --> 00:55:03.829]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:55:03.889 --> 00:55:05.510]  And Roger Stone's got big breaking news.
[00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:08.131]  Mike Cernovich dropped huge bombs today.
[00:55:08.672 --> 00:55:17.477]  And, you know, I apologize to Mike Cernovich for saying that one of his sources was, he didn't get mad at me, but I was partially wrong, was Donald Trump Jr.
[00:55:19.284 --> 00:55:20.967]  I was just saying the media has already said that.
[00:55:21.107 --> 00:55:22.409]  He tweets him all the time.
[00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:24.713]  We know he's one of the biggest patriots inside.
[00:55:24.733 --> 00:55:26.095]  And I know that.
[00:55:27.714 --> 00:55:29.335]  I know who Cernovich's people are.
[00:55:29.395 --> 00:55:31.117]  They're high-level staffers.
[00:55:31.157 --> 00:55:32.198]  We have some of the same ones.
[00:55:32.238 --> 00:55:37.402]  But he, for some reason, they return his calls all the time, and I guess he works them better than I do, which is fine.
[00:55:37.442 --> 00:55:38.863]  I'm glad Cernovich is there.
[00:55:39.603 --> 00:55:41.905]  But it is true that it's not Donald Jr.
[00:55:41.965 --> 00:55:43.947]  giving him the big scoops.
[00:55:44.127 --> 00:55:46.969]  It's just Donald Jr., I guess, that got him introduced to a bunch of people.
[00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:49.251]  But it's making him so mad.
[00:55:49.331 --> 00:55:54.936]  And CNN has come out with a big report that's one of the only accurate ones I've ever seen them do.
[00:55:55.236 --> 00:55:56.417]  It's quasi-accurate.
[00:55:56.917 --> 00:56:07.635]  And this is what I was told by a major New York Times writer, another filmmaker slash major Hollywood writer and journalist, and then now some other phone calls.
[00:56:07.675 --> 00:56:09.178]  They're being very nice right now.
[00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:10.761]  And they're saying, look,
[00:56:12.501 --> 00:56:20.985]  Stop getting into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the 300 missing billion, which the Treasury Secretary came out two days ago and said we were right, broke it two months ago, and just leave Muslims alone.
[00:56:21.245 --> 00:56:22.205]  I am leaving Muslims alone.
[00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:23.786]  I didn't want to start the wars, I wanted to stir them up.
[00:56:24.166 --> 00:56:36.191]  But I don't want the most radical Muslims brought over, unvetted from seven countries, where they just, the local imams run the passports, you know, and you drive in a bus with a bunch of chickens on it to a bombed out airport, then they fly here one flight a week.
[00:56:36.251 --> 00:56:37.672]  What the, in Hades is that?
[00:56:38.152 --> 00:56:46.218]  I love how they blame you when you were the first one to try to take the heat off of Muslims for 9-11 and put the mirror right at the American government for false flags.
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:51.222]  Exactly, but the media then misrepresented what I said.
[00:56:51.983 --> 00:57:02.791]  Criminal elements of our government, like Mr. Brennan, who is an admitted Wahhabist, have sold out to the Saudis, and the Saudis and Prince Bandar and all the rest
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:07.803]  And then their enemy, when we had 9-11, Iraq, got attacked.
[00:57:08.403 --> 00:57:09.083]  That was wrong.
[00:57:09.203 --> 00:57:10.044]  We blamed Iraq.
[00:57:10.424 --> 00:57:11.045]  It was wrong.
[00:57:11.385 --> 00:57:12.065]  It's fraud.
[00:57:12.385 --> 00:57:13.166]  That's the history.
[00:57:13.406 --> 00:57:14.026]  That's a fact.
[00:57:14.086 --> 00:57:14.987]  It's come out in Congress.
[00:57:15.247 --> 00:57:22.932]  And I've had Walter Jones on probably 15 times, one of the best members of Congress, from North Carolina, who has seen the secret 28 pages.
[00:57:22.952 --> 00:57:25.634]  Senator Graham, seen the 28 pages.
[00:57:25.754 --> 00:57:27.135]  We've interviewed him once on camera.
[00:57:28.015 --> 00:57:29.456]  That he was an RNC or something.
[00:57:30.236 --> 00:57:39.022]  And the Transportation Secretary, Panetta, all of them have come out and said there was a stand down, ordered because the Saudis were involved.
[00:57:39.482 --> 00:57:47.607]  The government then had a NORAD takeover drill, putting all these inputs onto the screens of NORAD and the FAA, where they thought it was a hijacking drill.
[00:57:48.067 --> 00:57:54.031]  They ordered the F-16s to fly at intercept at stallout speed, like 250 miles an hour.
[00:57:54.731 --> 00:57:56.053]  I've interviewed all the people involved.
[00:57:56.434 --> 00:57:59.859]  I had Colonel Don DeGrand Prix, who was a CIA weapons shipper.
[00:58:01.275 --> 00:58:04.378]  On, and he had been at the Pentagon and met with the generals.
[00:58:04.398 --> 00:58:13.905]  He even gave me the names of the pilots that refused orders, uh, the general higher-up refused orders in the Air Force and ordered two AIM-9s, Sidewinder missiles, into Flight 93.
[00:58:14.306 --> 00:58:18.609]  There was no let's roll and stewardesses at 30-something thousand feet on regular cell phones.
[00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:20.491]  All that sounds great, it was made up.
[00:58:21.111 --> 00:58:24.494]  The Air Force did the right thing, because that thing was going right at the Capitol, and they blew it up.
[00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:26.676]  But I'm digressing, I want to get Kumi on.
[00:58:28.041 --> 00:58:30.764]  You sit there and say, oh, the government.
[00:58:31.404 --> 00:58:32.926]  In fact, I would get confronted on CNN.
[00:58:32.986 --> 00:58:34.868]  Are you saying the firefighters and police were part of it?
[00:58:34.928 --> 00:58:35.749]  No, they were the heroes.
[00:58:37.574 --> 00:58:39.134]  But clearly there were bombs in the buildings.
[00:58:39.214 --> 00:58:40.975]  Clearly Deep State was working with the Muslims.
[00:58:41.215 --> 00:58:45.516]  And now you see Europe opening its borders to the Muslims, 5 million of them, 80% military age men.
[00:58:45.896 --> 00:58:46.896]  You see them working with it.
[00:58:46.916 --> 00:58:55.559]  I mean, I remember the FBI was in the news at the time saying, in late 2001, right after the attack, saying, it's like Al-Qaeda has moles in the FBI and CIA.
[00:58:55.599 --> 00:58:56.839]  They know what we're going to do before we do it.
[00:58:57.459 --> 00:59:00.840]  That's because the top people were working with Saudi Arabia coordinating.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:03.641]  And I saw it on Larry King Live a week or two after 9-11.
[00:59:04.921 --> 00:59:05.701]  Prince Bandar.
[00:59:05.901 --> 00:59:06.742]  Known as Bandar Bush.
[00:59:07.042 --> 00:59:08.182]  He's like best friends with the Bush family.
[00:59:08.202 --> 00:59:08.703]  Jump at any time.
[00:59:09.163 --> 00:59:09.743]  He's brought at 9-11.
[00:59:09.783 --> 00:59:10.783]  Owen Troyer.
[00:59:11.804 --> 00:59:15.785]  And Bandar Bush was on CNN on Larry King Live.
[00:59:15.825 --> 00:59:19.387]  Larry King Live says, oh, the murderer, piece of garbage, you know, coward.
[00:59:20.007 --> 00:59:20.607]  Some have been lied to.
[00:59:20.627 --> 00:59:22.408]  He goes, oh, watch yourself.
[00:59:22.468 --> 00:59:24.109]  Somebody's got to go find the archives of this and do it.
[00:59:24.329 --> 00:59:25.809]  Watch yourself, Larry King.
[00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:28.010]  He is a hero in my country.
[00:59:28.711 --> 00:59:29.571]  King goes, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:59:29.611 --> 00:59:31.572]  He goes, yes, now you'll understand.
[00:59:31.952 --> 00:59:33.112]  Because they're heroes.
[00:59:33.172 --> 00:59:34.213]  They look good over there.
[00:59:35.407 --> 00:59:41.684]  Then their enemy, Saudi Arabia, it gets, Saudi Arabia's enemy, Iraq gets hit.
[00:59:43.024 --> 00:59:53.472]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this, and so here I am, exposing it day one, and they're attacking me, saying the government did it, no criminal elements did it, and then they claim that I'm saying radical Islam doesn't exist.
[00:59:53.532 --> 01:00:12.367]  No, this whole broadcast is about defense of the West, because a Turkish-slash-Islamic Kurd, who's on the Federal Reserve Board of New York, that runs the whole Federal Reserve, and who gets billions from a school lunch program, with a monopoly through his yogurt company, who works with the UN and Peter Sutherland and George Soros to bring in the illegals,
[01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:14.648]  Or excuse me, we don't know he was bringing illegals.
[01:00:14.828 --> 01:00:19.291]  Let's bring in unvetted people, I'm not saying he brings in illegals, into the country.
[01:00:20.772 --> 01:00:22.553]  And then he says, oh, it's the State Department does it.
[01:00:22.573 --> 01:00:25.034]  But he lobbies through the U.N., the State Department, the U.N.
[01:00:25.074 --> 01:00:25.715]  certifies it.
[01:00:26.664 --> 01:00:33.446]  Just makes it up, says it's good, the State Department then brings him in, and then he's suing me saying I say that Muslims being brought in are bringing TB.
[01:00:33.846 --> 01:00:49.611]  I've had five law firms look at it, two of them we've engaged, they say it's the biggest joke lawsuit they've ever seen, probably done for a publicity stunt, but the point is I've still got to spend a lot of money to fight it, and clearly they've cut off our Google advertising, they're coming after us, and CNN says we're exploding and we're dangerous.
[01:00:49.891 --> 01:00:52.912]  So they've gone from saying, oh we're kooks, we're nobody, we're fake news,
[01:00:53.892 --> 01:00:57.478]  Two, we're exploding, we're dangerous, something needs to be done about us.
[01:00:57.538 --> 01:01:02.105]  Now, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win Mahatma Gandhi.
[01:01:02.286 --> 01:01:03.307]  So all I'm saying is...
[01:01:04.722 --> 01:01:09.726]  I don't care about having a big mansion and a helicopter pad and a jet like Rush Limbaugh.
[01:01:10.007 --> 01:01:18.194]  It's great Rush Limbaugh has 5 employees and decides to have huge NFL parties and decides to have Elton John for $3 million come sing at his wedding.
[01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:18.774]  That's fine.
[01:01:18.794 --> 01:01:19.575]  I'm a free market guy.
[01:01:19.815 --> 01:01:20.536]  Gives people jobs.
[01:01:21.476 --> 01:01:24.379]  I've taken the money of being a big syndicated talk show host.
[01:01:24.419 --> 01:01:25.320]  They get it right finally.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.521]  Over 200 affiliates.
[01:01:26.541 --> 01:01:27.281]  CNN went and checked.
[01:01:27.441 --> 01:01:28.142]  It's a lot more than that.
[01:01:28.182 --> 01:01:30.164]  We just stopped publishing them so they can't harass them.
[01:01:31.838 --> 01:01:32.579]  It's like 270 now.
[01:01:32.599 --> 01:01:34.480]  I mean, talking big cities, you name it.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.861]  They are panicking and they admit all of this.
[01:01:37.701 --> 01:01:46.226]  And what I've done as one of the biggest talk show hosts in the United States is taken all that money and hired Owen Schroer and Leanne McAdoo and all these editors and crew and writers.
[01:01:46.266 --> 01:01:53.850]  And I want to do that even more so we can really have people in the field all the time and change the world because we're spending everything that's coming in.
[01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:56.692]  I usually leave reserves for lawsuits or emergencies.
[01:01:57.972 --> 01:01:59.253]  I'm building a new huge studio.
[01:01:59.433 --> 01:02:01.275]  I'm launching a major TV network.
[01:02:01.295 --> 01:02:03.396]  We're going to be on the air at least 16, 17 hours a day.
[01:02:04.276 --> 01:02:06.958]  Within six months, within two months, another six, seven, eight hours.
[01:02:07.498 --> 01:02:10.881]  So instead of being four or five hours, we'll be like 10 hours, 11 hours.
[01:02:10.901 --> 01:02:12.802]  And we'll be up to 16, 18 hours a day.
[01:02:13.402 --> 01:02:14.503]  I intend to do this.
[01:02:14.643 --> 01:02:15.564]  Owen's going to have a show.
[01:02:15.584 --> 01:02:16.664]  Knight's going to have a show.
[01:02:17.085 --> 01:02:18.305]  Mike Cernovich is going to have a show.
[01:02:18.365 --> 01:02:19.386]  Roger Stone's going to have a show.
[01:02:19.766 --> 01:02:20.867]  All the hardcore people.
[01:02:21.307 --> 01:02:22.768]  Roundtables, you name it.
[01:02:22.808 --> 01:02:23.569]  More reporters.
[01:02:24.269 --> 01:02:25.049]  This is happening.
[01:02:25.169 --> 01:02:27.991]  I'm going to expend everything in the face of the globalists.
[01:02:28.051 --> 01:02:28.991]  We came from nowhere.
[01:02:29.031 --> 01:02:31.292]  We built the anti-globalist movement together.
[01:02:31.493 --> 01:02:36.135]  The anti-New World Order movement that Barry Goldwater and Phyllis Schlafly and Ron Paul and others launched.
[01:02:36.475 --> 01:02:39.516]  We now are taking over the world intellectually.
[01:02:39.777 --> 01:02:42.038]  The globalists are trying to use power to control us.
[01:02:42.318 --> 01:02:44.579]  Boycotts to shut us down or threats of death or prison.
[01:02:44.899 --> 01:02:47.020]  We're committed so there isn't anywhere.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:47.960]  Do we have Anthony Cumia?
[01:02:51.322 --> 01:02:51.682]  Okay, great.
[01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:52.803]  We're getting him on the Skype.
[01:02:54.016 --> 01:02:55.297]  We're not backing down.
[01:02:55.597 --> 01:02:56.638]  We're not giving in.
[01:02:56.698 --> 01:02:57.959]  This is history happening.
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:06.927]  And quite frankly, everyone should want to go to InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsShow.com, InfoWars.com forward slash show, and donate $10, $100.
[01:03:07.607 --> 01:03:12.131]  Everybody should go get nutraceuticals and multivitamin, mineral mix, fruit punch for your kids and yourself.
[01:03:12.351 --> 01:03:12.852]  Tastes great.
[01:03:12.892 --> 01:03:13.813]  You absorb it better.
[01:03:14.053 --> 01:03:14.873]  Everybody should get X2.
[01:03:14.954 --> 01:03:16.475]  Everybody should get a Molon Lave shirt.
[01:03:18.024 --> 01:03:31.838]  Support the InfoWar, get shirts that help you meet like-minded people, get out there, get involved, sign up for AutoShip, get 10% off, that way you get a discount, you get great nutraceuticals that make your life better, and you don't have to keep thinking every month of supporting us, it just happens automatically.
[01:03:32.438 --> 01:03:33.159]  Because here's the deal.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.141]  History's happening.
[01:03:36.573 --> 01:03:47.943]  The nomenclature, the ideas, the talking points that I've brought forward, how this is an info war, how it's a military operation by we the people against the globalists, has resonated with the military, with the patriots of the intelligence agencies.
[01:03:47.963 --> 01:03:49.144]  They were waiting for the people.
[01:03:49.705 --> 01:03:51.887]  Just like I had Katherine Austen-Fitts on today.
[01:03:51.927 --> 01:03:52.808]  Jump at any time, Owen.
[01:03:53.388 --> 01:03:54.929]  Katherine Austen-Fitts was on today.
[01:03:54.949 --> 01:03:56.191]  And he's already been on for hours.
[01:03:56.251 --> 01:03:57.692]  People just tuned in and are saying, let him talk.
[01:03:57.732 --> 01:03:58.673]  Probably let Owen talk.
[01:03:58.733 --> 01:03:59.834]  No, go ahead.
[01:04:00.919 --> 01:04:06.165]  Kevin Austin Fitch used to manage $300 billion dollars, HUD department, Clinton's total insider, until she saw how evil it was.
[01:04:07.286 --> 01:04:11.810]  And she came out and said, absolutely, you know, agreed it's a bunch of devil worshippers running it.
[01:04:11.830 --> 01:04:14.533]  It's like this big banker in the Netherlands that just came out in mainstream news.
[01:04:14.573 --> 01:04:19.839]  He is who he says he is and says, starts out with sex with women and parties and drugs and the next year, you know, they want you to kill kids.
[01:04:20.399 --> 01:04:22.422]  It's about being a psychopath in training.
[01:04:22.822 --> 01:04:23.423]  She said,
[01:04:24.721 --> 01:04:31.204]  That Trump's for real, but America's the swamp, the counties and cities are the swamp, we're the swamp, we have to get active.
[01:04:31.484 --> 01:04:37.567]  The Muslims, dominated by radical Wahhabism out of Saudi Arabia, 80% of Islam is Sunni.
[01:04:39.068 --> 01:04:48.193]  Ladies and gentlemen, they, the average Muslim, gives around 20% of their money to political causes, and another 10-30% to their churches, to their mosque.
[01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:57.424]  We're talking, they're giving 30-50% of their money to be political, and their religion is political.
[01:04:57.484 --> 01:04:58.224]  Political Islam.
[01:04:58.985 --> 01:05:16.477]  The average American gives maybe 1% to the church, maybe 1-2% to charity, and then they're just fake globalist charities, you know, where you give 97% of it, or 96.7% is what it was, and the Clintons get stolen, and they take over the whole charity system, and then sex slave kids, and it's in the Associated Press, and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:05:17.412 --> 01:05:21.836]  And a bunch of kids get killed, and the UN craps in their water supply on purpose, and people die of cholera.
[01:05:21.856 --> 01:05:24.798]  It's all a sick joke about using people on purpose.
[01:05:24.818 --> 01:05:26.160]  They do it on purpose.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.321]  It's their philosophy.
[01:05:28.277 --> 01:05:35.139]  And we can pull up that article, you know, where the guy talks about the Satanism and where he says that it's all about being totally selfish and totally evil and divide and conquer.
[01:05:35.339 --> 01:05:36.640]  Well, you cover it though, Alex.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.901]  And that's why CNN freaks out, is because you're willing to cover it.
[01:05:39.921 --> 01:05:46.283]  And that's why when people find out about Alex Jones and In4Wars.com, they come for your information because it's actually hardcore.
[01:05:46.323 --> 01:05:47.523]  It's actually groundbreaking.
[01:05:47.763 --> 01:05:50.144]  It's not milquetoast like CNN or Fox News.
[01:05:50.484 --> 01:05:53.445]  Why does CNN or Fox News even have an audience right now?
[01:05:53.965 --> 01:05:59.909]  Well, most of them are above the age of 50 or 60 and they can just put power on the TV and then they pop up.
[01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:03.691]  And, well, that's the old age of getting news.
[01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:05.392]  That's the old way of collecting news.
[01:06:05.512 --> 01:06:10.455]  Now, you go to YouTube and you see that InfoWars is live for 10, 30 hours a day right now.
[01:06:10.695 --> 01:06:12.516]  You go to DrudgeReport, you go to InfoWars.com.
[01:06:12.536 --> 01:06:13.897]  This is the new way of getting news.
[01:06:14.397 --> 01:06:19.020]  And Alex, once people are starting to come to you, you're seeing the freak out in the media right now.
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:20.521]  You saw it with that video you played earlier.
[01:06:21.481 --> 01:06:25.565]  You had Cernovich on, and he's in the White House press corps, and he's saying, you guys aren't getting it.
[01:06:25.965 --> 01:06:26.846]  You're not following the news.
[01:06:26.866 --> 01:06:29.849]  Antifa is out burning and killing and shooting cops and stabbing people.
[01:06:30.169 --> 01:06:30.669]  Shame on you.
[01:06:30.709 --> 01:06:34.973]  And they look at him like they want to kill him, then they want to get him thrown out for just talking to him like a man.
[01:06:35.173 --> 01:06:35.994]  So here's the bottom line.
[01:06:37.261 --> 01:06:38.962]  We used to do a fundraiser maybe once a year.
[01:06:38.982 --> 01:06:46.924]  Now I'm doing it every couple months because I got a member of the Federal Reserve Board, a top Islamist, Muslim guy, openly coming after us.
[01:06:47.024 --> 01:06:48.285]  I've got the media saying we're fake.
[01:06:48.745 --> 01:06:58.988]  I've got 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 investigative journalists, sometimes 20, who aren't even real journalists, following me around, going back to college and before, trying to find people to make stuff up.
[01:06:59.668 --> 01:07:01.549]  And look, it doesn't matter because they're discredited.
[01:07:02.588 --> 01:07:07.913]  But bottom line, we've got big specials, 25, 30%, 20% off, a lot of free shipping at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:07:07.933 --> 01:07:11.016]  These are products you need to begin with.
[01:07:11.717 --> 01:07:13.919]  These are products that are absolutely essential.
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:23.309]  All these are either private labeled, already best sellers that are in the market, and then we just discount them, or they're stuff I've gone to some of the top producers and made.
[01:07:24.653 --> 01:07:28.114]  Because I want you to buy it, and I want it to work, and I want you to come back and get it over and over again.
[01:07:28.134 --> 01:07:30.514]  But I need to raise a lot of money.
[01:07:30.914 --> 01:07:34.275]  This studio costs a quarter million dollars, and it's an inexpensive one.
[01:07:34.295 --> 01:07:35.615]  The equipment, another half million.
[01:07:36.095 --> 01:07:36.875]  That sounds like a lot.
[01:07:36.936 --> 01:07:37.276]  It's not.
[01:07:37.436 --> 01:07:40.396]  We have the cheapest boards, all the stuff for radio and TV.
[01:07:40.796 --> 01:07:42.277]  One of the cheaper ones, like 50 grand apiece.
[01:07:42.297 --> 01:07:43.537]  We've got to have six or seven of them.
[01:07:43.777 --> 01:07:44.837]  I want to launch more shows.
[01:07:44.957 --> 01:07:48.978]  I want to magnify what Anthony Comey is doing with his network.
[01:07:49.358 --> 01:07:55.547]  I want to just, that's why we're not in competition with anybody except tyrants, socialists, globalists, dirtbags, control freaks, and scum.
[01:07:56.187 --> 01:07:57.589]  I'm here to promote everybody.
[01:07:57.790 --> 01:08:00.513]  I want, we are going to take the world back together.
[01:08:01.154 --> 01:08:03.818]  That's why I couldn't believe two weeks ago, we were going to Anthony Comey and we now got on the line.
[01:08:04.398 --> 01:08:04.999]  Two weeks ago.
[01:08:06.055 --> 01:08:12.621]  They had Breitbart, who does a lot of great work, and they had a bunch of Washington papers, Washington Examiner.
[01:08:12.641 --> 01:08:30.658]  Come out and attack Dr. Corsi, who has three number one New York Times best-selling political books, changed one election he's given total credit for in a presidential election, influenced two others, was in all sorts of secret ops, Harvard, super finance degree, friends with Trump for 45 years, total insider.
[01:08:31.687 --> 01:08:34.910]  But a good guy, he gets the secret documents via the White House.
[01:08:35.651 --> 01:08:40.076]  Publishes them that they stole $290 something billion, now it's over $300 billion.
[01:08:40.496 --> 01:08:42.018]  He's just got four years of documents.
[01:08:43.715 --> 01:08:43.995]  There it is.
[01:08:44.115 --> 01:08:47.237]  Author known for birther book steps into Fannie-Freddie battle.
[01:08:47.998 --> 01:08:51.920]  And then they go on to say, oh, the birthery question, where Obama's from.
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.782]  Obama said he was from Kenya to cover up who his dad was.
[01:08:55.822 --> 01:08:57.303]  The birth certificate was a fraud.
[01:08:57.523 --> 01:09:05.228]  The point is, is that even they attack us, and then what does the Chairman of the Treasury come out, or the Treasury Secretary comes out and says, we're right.
[01:09:05.948 --> 01:09:06.488]  It's true.
[01:09:06.508 --> 01:09:09.009]  Obama raided Fannie Freddie.
[01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:10.989]  $300 billion to pay for Obamacare.
[01:09:11.289 --> 01:09:12.650]  It's all over the news, confirmed.
[01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:13.690]  Even some news gave us credit.
[01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:22.792]  The point is, even conservative outlets think we're in competition with them when all we do is plug the other good stories and link to them every day.
[01:09:23.012 --> 01:09:24.253]  And we're bigger than Breitbart.
[01:09:24.433 --> 01:09:25.733]  We're bigger than those other sites.
[01:09:26.133 --> 01:09:27.333]  The only thing bigger is Drudge.
[01:09:27.373 --> 01:09:28.714]  And I'm glad there's somebody bigger.
[01:09:28.734 --> 01:09:29.454]  I don't want to be the only target.
[01:09:29.634 --> 01:09:32.595]  The point is, I'm not trying to be bigger, Breitbart.
[01:09:32.795 --> 01:09:33.835]  I'm not trying to be bigger.
[01:09:34.535 --> 01:09:35.496]  Washington Examiner.
[01:09:35.756 --> 01:09:40.739]  I'm trying to defeat the globalists that literally want to teach five-year-olds how to be trannies.
[01:09:40.799 --> 01:09:41.599]  I'm not against trannies.
[01:09:41.799 --> 01:09:42.840]  Don't sexualize kids.
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:45.762]  I'm trying to stop people running around saying randomly kill cops.
[01:09:45.802 --> 01:09:50.685]  I'm trying to stop people sipping our jobs overseas on purpose to teach us Americans to lay down and put up with it.
[01:09:51.005 --> 01:09:52.126]  I have a fighting spirit.
[01:09:52.206 --> 01:09:53.006]  I'm not a slave.
[01:09:53.206 --> 01:09:54.287]  And I'm sick of this crap.
[01:09:54.527 --> 01:10:00.851]  And Americans need to know, you say you want to fight all the time, you say you want to do something, you say you want to change the world, we're doing it!
[01:10:01.371 --> 01:10:03.812]  And I want our audience to know I salute you for your support!
[01:10:04.112 --> 01:10:08.075]  But we really do have 45 million people that listen or watch every week, conservatively.
[01:10:08.475 --> 01:10:12.597]  We really have 10 million different IP addresses that come into InfoWars every month of different people.
[01:10:13.017 --> 01:10:20.481]  That means less than 1% is buying stuff, and only a few percent are sharing our links, and those people have already changed the world!
[01:10:20.921 --> 01:10:23.723]  It's not me they're scared of, it's that we built a focal point.
[01:10:23.883 --> 01:10:26.504]  Like Ron Paul used to say about himself, he's nothing, it's the focal point.
[01:10:26.984 --> 01:10:28.105]  We built a focal point.
[01:10:28.345 --> 01:10:33.650]  That Trump has told me personally he knows put him over the top and was a third of his people on the street or more.
[01:10:34.090 --> 01:10:34.951]  They know that!
[01:10:35.371 --> 01:10:36.993]  They know they're scared of you!
[01:10:37.674 --> 01:10:50.405]  And they know if you just share more links and more videos, or start your own show, or speak out, or call into C-SPAN, and get active, and make this a national sport, kicking globalist ass, and returning the republic, that their whole scam's over!
[01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:52.811]  So, they want to fight with me?
[01:10:52.971 --> 01:10:55.113]  I'm not scared of them coming after me, demonizing me.
[01:10:55.333 --> 01:10:58.856]  I just want to make sure we politically kick their asses to the moon.
[01:10:59.176 --> 01:10:59.816]  You got that?
[01:11:00.497 --> 01:11:02.519]  They want a problem, they're gonna get one.
[01:11:02.539 --> 01:11:07.903]  To quote Ralph Kramden, or maybe it was the other guy, the point is, to the moon without a rocket!
[01:11:08.283 --> 01:11:09.805]  That's what we're coming down to here.
[01:11:09.985 --> 01:11:11.326]  This is information war.
[01:11:11.586 --> 01:11:12.367]  This is the fight.
[01:11:12.607 --> 01:11:13.468]  This is the republic.
[01:11:13.588 --> 01:11:14.109]  And what do I do?
[01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:24.960]  I bring you the best water filters, best price, best seeds, best shirts, best stuff, best high quality supplements that my fat ass has lost 70 pounds on, the best freeze dryers.
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:25.601]  It's all there.
[01:11:26.724 --> 01:11:28.705]  All you gotta do is go to InfoWarsTore.com and support it.
[01:11:28.745 --> 01:11:33.106]  And then we're here to support all the other networks, and all the other Patriots, and all the other people, and all the other folks.
[01:11:33.406 --> 01:11:38.908]  You know, the Gavin McGinnis's of the world, and the Anthony Cume's of the world, and all the other great people.
[01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:39.829]  The Paul Watson's of the world.
[01:11:40.209 --> 01:11:41.749]  I want to kick globalist ass.
[01:11:41.909 --> 01:11:43.450]  I don't, I'm confident.
[01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:45.191]  I don't need to be the big guy.
[01:11:45.531 --> 01:11:47.091]  I need everybody to come together.
[01:11:47.111 --> 01:11:48.532]  I don't mean to get off on some jag here.
[01:11:49.332 --> 01:11:50.213]  It's just good God.
[01:11:50.573 --> 01:11:51.253]  This is incredible.
[01:11:51.293 --> 01:11:57.598]  Now, let's go ahead and go to Anthony Comey, and I apologize, we got him on about 10 minutes late, and he's here, and we got about 20 minutes, and Roger Stone's joining us.
[01:11:57.638 --> 01:12:04.923]  Tell us about your network, how folks listen, and the fact that you had number one show in the country, syndicated in the cities you were in, kicked off the year.
[01:12:05.123 --> 01:12:08.966]  Not because of cussing, but because big corporations didn't like it and control the FCC.
[01:12:09.226 --> 01:12:13.469]  Then kicked off XM, because you called people killing cops animals, and they are animals.
[01:12:13.769 --> 01:12:18.653]  So the fact is, you've been successful over and over again, and now you've been relegated to the internet, which is great.
[01:12:19.253 --> 01:12:24.379]  Uh, not actually, I'm not, but, but, Anthony Cumia, you know, when you're on my show during the day, you're on a bunch of stations.
[01:12:24.659 --> 01:12:30.726]  The point is, is that, is that it's not that we're losers, we're getting relegated, we're being relegated because they can't compete.
[01:12:30.766 --> 01:12:37.313]  So, explain to people what it's like in this country, trying to get the word out and then what you think of InfoWars and the call to action, my friend.
[01:12:37.333 --> 01:12:37.873]  Sorry, I'm ranting.
[01:12:37.893 --> 01:12:40.837]  Oh my god, no, please, Alex, you, first of all,
[01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:43.259]  Boy, are they coming after you.
[01:12:43.819 --> 01:12:44.540]  I've seen this.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:56.089]  It's happening all over with people that are making a difference and getting to the people and actually giving them something that they can latch on and say, yes, I want to fight.
[01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:57.831]  I want to listen to this guy.
[01:12:57.971 --> 01:13:02.775]  I want to hear an opposing viewpoint from the mainstream media.
[01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:05.717]  And you have been on the forefront of this for so long.
[01:13:06.138 --> 01:13:08.540]  And man, they are coming after you.
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:27.914]  If anybody thinks this is a coincidence, that all of a sudden a bunch of people that are stirring other people up, that are getting them to think, that are getting them to see that there's another way of thinking than this liberal, progressive crap that we see on a daily basis, they are taking us out of the mix.
[01:13:27.974 --> 01:13:32.357]  They're trying to quiet us because we're dangerous to them.
[01:13:32.617 --> 01:13:37.441]  We are totally against their plan of keeping everybody
[01:13:38.221 --> 01:13:47.523]  Under wraps, under their feet, their boots on our necks, and you are a prime example right now of them trying to discredit you.
[01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:49.403]  It's been that way for so long.
[01:13:49.803 --> 01:13:54.264]  Me, I've been thrown off of every single type of mainstream media there is.
[01:13:54.544 --> 01:13:57.325]  I've had to literally start my network.
[01:13:57.365 --> 01:14:01.586]  Even though you always get top ratings and are always number one, it's because you are effective.
[01:14:01.606 --> 01:14:04.807]  Your voice and your information carries gravitas.
[01:14:04.967 --> 01:14:06.027]  That's why you're shut down.
[01:14:06.892 --> 01:14:07.712]  That's what it is.
[01:14:07.772 --> 01:14:10.874]  They don't want us to have too much juice.
[01:14:11.354 --> 01:14:12.495]  Too much power.
[01:14:12.875 --> 01:14:17.778]  And the second you start really influencing people, if you're making jokes, maybe it's worth it.
[01:14:17.798 --> 01:14:21.460]  No, the second you start acting like a man trying to have a country for your children, then you're off the air.
[01:14:22.293 --> 01:14:23.174]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:14:23.514 --> 01:14:25.256]  That's a thing of the past.
[01:14:26.176 --> 01:14:26.857]  I'm disgusted.
[01:14:26.877 --> 01:14:35.785]  I watched some amazing documentaries on World War I and II, and Korea, Vietnam, and you just see men acting like men.
[01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:38.086]  And that now is a bad word?
[01:14:38.427 --> 01:14:41.209]  You're not allowed to be a man in this country anymore.
[01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:45.032]  Colleges are saying don't have paintings or murals of muscular men on the sports team.
[01:14:45.092 --> 01:14:46.714]  It's hurtful to those that aren't muscular.
[01:14:50.608 --> 01:14:53.030]  Is every story now worthy of The Onion?
[01:14:53.451 --> 01:14:58.836]  I used to read The Onion, a great parody site, and think, oh, that's hilarious because it's so ridiculous.
[01:14:59.136 --> 01:15:07.365]  Now mainstream media is absolutely outdoing The Onion for the most ridiculous things you'll ever, ever read.
[01:15:08.205 --> 01:15:25.698]  Let me ask you this, because you don't want to get into it, and we don't like to bitch about what's happening to us, but I mean, talk about the persecution you've gone through getting kicked off your hit show that was on for a decade, you know, had in many cases more viewers and listeners than Stern, and then you get kicked off because you stand up against Black Lives Matter going around killing cops.
[01:15:26.445 --> 01:15:33.690]  Yeah, all you have to say is exactly what leaders in the black community have said for years and years and years.
[01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:35.231]  There's a problem with violence.
[01:15:35.551 --> 01:15:40.094]  There's a problem with out-of-wedlock children.
[01:15:40.114 --> 01:15:42.456]  And you just bring that up.
[01:15:42.816 --> 01:15:45.398]  But I'm not the right person to bring that up.
[01:15:45.478 --> 01:15:55.144]  So when I did, I was called, you know, racist and you're relegated to trying to fight against what labels people are giving you.
[01:15:55.985 --> 01:15:56.405]  No more.
[01:15:56.985 --> 01:15:59.427]  You don't even get to argue that point anymore.
[01:15:59.727 --> 01:16:08.130]  You're now arguing that, oh no, I'm not a racist, I'm not that, and they take you out of the mix for what you originally were trying to discuss.
[01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:13.072]  And I should add, compoundmedia.com, you're so polite when you plug it, compoundmedia.com.
[01:16:13.092 --> 01:16:14.813]  By the way, the purpose is a survival mechanism.
[01:16:14.853 --> 01:16:15.753]  They're huge, they're great.
[01:16:16.213 --> 01:16:18.274]  I want people to be bigger than we are.
[01:16:18.914 --> 01:16:20.094]  And in some cases, a lot of folks are.
[01:16:20.434 --> 01:16:22.655]  Some of their shows have more views than we do.
[01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:25.456]  That is a really good feeling, because I don't like being the only target here.
[01:16:25.616 --> 01:16:28.096]  It seems like that's kind of what's happening, but they kind of pick somebody.
[01:16:28.356 --> 01:16:29.897]  But let's shift gears and jump in any time.
[01:16:29.917 --> 01:16:32.017]  I know you host the last two hours, but Owen, jump in.
[01:16:32.057 --> 01:16:33.478]  I didn't just have you in here just to sit there.
[01:16:33.498 --> 01:16:36.418]  I know you're an awesome, awesome reporter, so please jump in.
[01:16:37.218 --> 01:16:38.739]  But talking about this,
[01:16:39.759 --> 01:16:40.719]  Take Stephen Colbert.
[01:16:40.759 --> 01:16:43.940]  He attacked me, that I know of, nine times the last two weeks.
[01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:46.640]  Lied about me, but oh, it's comedy, so it's okay.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:55.042]  Said I was a racist, said I didn't know what my kids' names were, said I didn't know what, you know, two teachers were out of, like, 16 teachers, you know, after I had lunch, when I'm sitting there on the stand or whatever.
[01:16:55.062 --> 01:16:58.383]  And I'm like, literally, I had a bunch of chili, and I can't remember every teacher, sorry.
[01:16:59.283 --> 01:17:00.183]  Nobody can, okay?
[01:17:00.223 --> 01:17:03.324]  But the point is, I'm too busy actually working to be able to teach.
[01:17:03.344 --> 01:17:06.044]  I go to all the conferences, and the kids get straight A's.
[01:17:06.284 --> 01:17:06.925]  Isn't that enough?
[01:17:06.985 --> 01:17:08.185]  You know, they're good kids.
[01:17:09.212 --> 01:17:18.675]  Here he comes, he says, this statement we'll play in a few minutes, which he says that basically he's a holster for Vladimir Putin's Vienna sausage.
[01:17:19.435 --> 01:17:21.636]  And this is somewhat of a family show, but big deal.
[01:17:21.656 --> 01:17:25.197]  That's what was said, saying that he's a minion of Russia and he's bad.
[01:17:25.557 --> 01:17:26.998]  He's totally pushing Russia around.
[01:17:27.038 --> 01:17:28.058]  He's pushing China around.
[01:17:28.098 --> 01:17:29.319]  He's pushing North Korea around.
[01:17:29.799 --> 01:17:30.659]  This is pure bull.
[01:17:31.159 --> 01:17:31.619]  It was U.S.
[01:17:31.659 --> 01:17:34.140]  intelligence leaked the stuff, you know, like Hillary's saying it's the Russians.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.161]  And so WikiLeaks and all this is happening.
[01:17:36.721 --> 01:17:38.402]  But then they're saying, oh, it's homophobic.
[01:17:38.442 --> 01:17:42.386]  They're now even, Anthony, eating their own, when clearly it's not homophobic.
[01:17:42.446 --> 01:17:45.849]  It's saying he's a butt kisser of Putin, which he isn't.
[01:17:45.869 --> 01:17:55.417]  If you call somebody a you-know-what sucker, like I call Congressman Schiff, I said he's a globalist you-know-what sucker, just like when De Niro says it in a movie about somebody.
[01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:58.039]  It means that they're groveling.
[01:17:58.319 --> 01:17:59.920]  It means they're servicing somebody.
[01:17:59.961 --> 01:18:01.462]  It isn't attacking gay people.
[01:18:01.882 --> 01:18:03.123]  We could do that if we wanted to.
[01:18:03.183 --> 01:18:03.704]  It's free speech.
[01:18:04.444 --> 01:18:07.087]  Even Colbert, they're saying, may lose his job over this.
[01:18:07.327 --> 01:18:08.448]  This is dangerous!
[01:18:09.069 --> 01:18:14.273]  Alex, what you're actually saying here is that the left knows what context is.
[01:18:14.774 --> 01:18:15.835]  Oh my God!
[01:18:16.135 --> 01:18:20.079]  They have no clue about context, comedy, sarcasm.
[01:18:20.479 --> 01:18:30.703]  Everything that's said by anybody is taken at face value, and should be dissected like that, and the discipline should be doled out accordingly.
[01:18:31.063 --> 01:18:33.724]  It's amazing, and I do love watching them eat their own.
[01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:41.107]  I am a First Amendment advocate like no one has seen, and I don't want anybody fired for anything they say.
[01:18:41.407 --> 01:18:48.871]  But if you're delusional enough to think that a network... Oh, he celebrated when Bill O'Reilly went, and again, he's not perfect.
[01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:49.111]  Yes, yes!
[01:18:50.371 --> 01:18:51.832]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:18:51.852 --> 01:19:01.557]  No, they would never think, if you think a network talk show host could get away with saying anything like that about Obama without a public execution, you're out of your mind.
[01:19:01.877 --> 01:19:03.258]  That's the problem I have.
[01:19:03.378 --> 01:19:06.720]  I don't have a problem with Colbert saying whatever he wants about anybody.
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:16.825]  I have a problem with the double standard that people like myself and my friends and associates are crucified for making a joke about a minority group or what have you.
[01:19:17.206 --> 01:19:19.407]  And then when it comes around to someone like Colbert,
[01:19:19.727 --> 01:19:20.547]  He gets free reign.
[01:19:20.567 --> 01:19:21.107]  Well, exactly.
[01:19:21.207 --> 01:19:23.968]  I'm from Texas and I like to make fun of rednecks.
[01:19:24.028 --> 01:19:26.009]  And I'm not bashing, but I mean, I've got some family.
[01:19:26.029 --> 01:19:28.390]  They're nice people, but they're literally like the Beverly Hillbillies.
[01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:32.651]  I may sound like there's some other people, but you know, I'm kind of like Beverly Hillbilly Light and it's kind of fun.
[01:19:33.131 --> 01:19:35.171]  But then I want to make fun of Asian people.
[01:19:35.212 --> 01:19:36.292]  My sister's Asian adopted.
[01:19:36.332 --> 01:19:36.812]  I love Asians.
[01:19:36.912 --> 01:19:37.732]  It's funny though.
[01:19:37.992 --> 01:19:39.713]  You know, the North Korean stuff's sad, but it's funny.
[01:19:40.193 --> 01:19:42.954]  You know, Kim Jong-un and people say, oh, you're being anti-Asian.
[01:19:43.014 --> 01:19:44.294]  No, it's funny stuff.
[01:19:44.354 --> 01:19:44.714]  It's funny.
[01:19:44.734 --> 01:19:45.775]  I mean, look at Japanese.
[01:19:45.795 --> 01:19:46.715]  They make fun of themselves.
[01:19:47.577 --> 01:19:47.977]  Sure!
[01:19:48.358 --> 01:19:48.858]  Absolutely!
[01:19:49.038 --> 01:19:53.062]  That used to be something that was taken in context of comedy.
[01:19:53.302 --> 01:19:55.624]  You could absolutely do stereotypical jokes.
[01:19:55.664 --> 01:19:57.325]  Remember Belushi doing the samurai?
[01:19:57.886 --> 01:19:58.546]  Absolutely!
[01:19:58.666 --> 01:20:01.949]  No one thought that was... Sorry.
[01:20:02.569 --> 01:20:03.390]  Can't do that anymore.
[01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:04.411]  That'd be too offensive.
[01:20:04.431 --> 01:20:08.775]  No one thought it was hateful or that you were inciting violence against these people.
[01:20:08.995 --> 01:20:10.016]  They're insane!
[01:20:10.236 --> 01:20:13.899]  The left is mentally ill when it comes to things like this.
[01:20:14.079 --> 01:20:16.541]  You know, and you talk about Stephen Colbert's show.
[01:20:16.661 --> 01:20:25.068]  I remember I watched Stephen Colbert like six, seven, eight years ago, and he would actually make fun of Obama regularly, but he would do it in a tasteful manner.
[01:20:25.088 --> 01:20:27.030]  He did it where it was creative.
[01:20:27.090 --> 01:20:27.730]  It was funny.
[01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:30.052]  It was what you would expect with any president.
[01:20:30.072 --> 01:20:31.113]  Of course, make fun of Trump.
[01:20:31.133 --> 01:20:31.954]  Of course, he's the president.
[01:20:31.974 --> 01:20:34.215]  Of course, he's going to get made fun of, but make it tasteful.
[01:20:34.616 --> 01:20:37.898]  Don't make some, you know, crude penis joke that's not funny.
[01:20:38.339 --> 01:20:38.859]  That's the key.
[01:20:38.899 --> 01:20:39.860]  It's not funny.
[01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:41.902]  When did Stephen Colbert quit being funny?
[01:20:42.202 --> 01:20:43.263]  It's when all the people
[01:20:43.743 --> 01:20:44.804]  I don't even know if it's the left.
[01:20:44.824 --> 01:20:46.226]  When did he become Tuck Buckford?
[01:20:46.626 --> 01:20:47.407]  Tuck Buckford?
[01:20:47.888 --> 01:20:50.350]  Let me put this, let me put this yogurt in my hair.
[01:20:50.951 --> 01:21:01.763]  If they would just stick to comedy, if they would try to be funny instead of trying to make a political message every night, then Stephen Colbert... This is what happens when you take steroids and peyote!
[01:21:01.863 --> 01:21:02.584]  This is what happens!
[01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:06.713]  Stephen Colbert has won, I'm pretty sure that he's won multiple Grammys.
[01:21:06.773 --> 01:21:18.480]  I think that his writers have run Grammys because he had a funny show when he was on Comedy Central, and then he got too political, he wanted to make a... There's Doug Buckford!
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:22.182]  Let me ask this question of Anthony Comey of compoundmedia.com.
[01:21:22.582 --> 01:21:27.125]  Look, I don't like to sit up here and beg the audience to support us, but here's the deal.
[01:21:27.145 --> 01:21:28.426]  We'll play Blue Sheet in a minute with audio.
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:31.581]  You could never do that today.
[01:21:31.601 --> 01:21:34.742]  In fact, I think I'm going to go back and recreate some skits and then watch the media attack me.
[01:21:34.762 --> 01:21:37.384]  Because we've got to exercise, kind of like open carry.
[01:21:37.704 --> 01:21:39.085]  You've got to let the cops know you're doing it.
[01:21:39.225 --> 01:21:40.966]  You know, do it in a smart way.
[01:21:41.366 --> 01:21:43.848]  But do it to show people guns aren't illegal in most areas.
[01:21:43.868 --> 01:21:44.788]  Stop implying they are.
[01:21:44.808 --> 01:21:45.929]  It's the same thing with comedy.
[01:21:45.989 --> 01:21:47.170]  It's like Seinfeld's a big liberal.
[01:21:47.930 --> 01:21:49.611]  And he says he can't go to college campuses now.
[01:21:49.651 --> 01:21:51.051]  Even his liberal jokes aren't allowed.
[01:21:51.071 --> 01:21:52.932]  This is a cult attacking reality.
[01:21:52.972 --> 01:21:57.694]  But we do have to ask the viewers and listeners for support because you're going to lose your speech if you don't support us.
[01:21:57.714 --> 01:21:58.954]  And I want to thank you for your support.
[01:21:59.334 --> 01:22:00.755]  But I want you to know it's a war.
[01:22:00.915 --> 01:22:01.495]  Enjoy it.
[01:22:01.575 --> 01:22:02.276]  Spread the link.
[01:22:02.296 --> 01:22:03.096]  Spread the articles.
[01:22:03.736 --> 01:22:06.977]  We're changing the world, but only a fraction of you are buying products.
[01:22:07.518 --> 01:22:09.778]  Only a fraction of you are spreading the links and the articles.
[01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:10.839]  If you'll just do it.
[01:22:11.239 --> 01:22:12.079]  Download the free app.
[01:22:12.099 --> 01:22:13.400]  Get your friends, your neighbors to do it.
[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:15.881]  If you'll call in to talk radio or call in to C-SPAN and
[01:22:16.781 --> 01:22:18.742]  Instead of saying Bill Clinton's a rapist, that's still ongoing.
[01:22:18.762 --> 01:22:19.783]  That was a good thing we came up with.
[01:22:19.803 --> 01:22:22.184]  Maybe go say Infowars.com, forbidden information.
[01:22:22.464 --> 01:22:23.345]  Find out why they're banning it.
[01:22:23.405 --> 01:22:24.946]  The point is, it's everybody.
[01:22:24.986 --> 01:22:27.187]  They just picked us as kind of wacky.
[01:22:27.467 --> 01:22:29.368]  They think, you know, they can take stuff out of context.
[01:22:29.428 --> 01:22:30.509]  It isn't just that I'm that big.
[01:22:30.809 --> 01:22:33.991]  It's that they think I've got some, you know, scales missing on my armored belly.
[01:22:34.031 --> 01:22:34.411]  It's true.
[01:22:34.731 --> 01:22:37.573]  You know, this dragon's got scales missing.
[01:22:37.593 --> 01:22:39.094]  I've got some spots you can get me.
[01:22:39.114 --> 01:22:41.355]  Because, I mean, I've just let it all hang out over the years.
[01:22:41.675 --> 01:22:44.137]  So if they can bring us down, they can bring everybody down.
[01:22:44.437 --> 01:22:47.318]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:22:47.358 --> 01:22:49.419]  Go donate or go buy the great products.
[01:22:49.439 --> 01:22:50.639]  Look at my mouth hanging open there.
[01:22:50.659 --> 01:22:51.819]  I look ridiculous.
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:56.081]  And support us and you'll see how we're building, how we're expanding.
[01:22:56.121 --> 01:22:56.601]  I mean, you're here.
[01:22:56.621 --> 01:22:57.221]  What are we doing, Owen?
[01:22:57.561 --> 01:23:06.204]  Well, since I've gotten here, you've already hired more people and you're building a new studio right back there that used to just kind of be an extra warehouse area for storage and stuff.
[01:23:07.441 --> 01:23:08.041]  They got it up.
[01:23:08.081 --> 01:23:09.042]  They're getting ready to build it.
[01:23:09.062 --> 01:23:11.443]  I know that the crew is going to be up here tonight working on it as well.
[01:23:11.463 --> 01:23:13.603]  We have people working here like 24 hours a day.
[01:23:13.703 --> 01:23:20.066]  Alex, I'll tell you, I think that you and I actually are a lot alike and that you don't realize it yet because I can relate to a lot of things.
[01:23:20.086 --> 01:23:22.387]  I understand your frustration, Alex, where
[01:23:23.027 --> 01:23:52.028]  You have to sit here, and actually I have a question for Anthony, and I'll finish this off with, where you have to sit here, and you've been doing your broadcast for 20 years, you've been proven right over the stretch of time, not just in short encapsulated bursts like the mainstream media appears to be right, you've been proven right over time, and yet you have to sit here and watch whatever it is on the television news, whatever station, putting out rhetoric or putting out- Homeland, ABC, NBC, it's not about us, but we have to make it about us because they're trying to destroy me, so I have to say who I am.
[01:23:52.168 --> 01:24:10.346]  And it's just so behind the times and you have to sit here and just must feel so frustrated that you're trying to reach people and it's just they don't even know you're there, they don't even know how real you are, they don't even have an accurate picture of reality and it's so frustrating sitting here like a mountain trying to get this attention and so you keep building, you keep expanding, you keep bringing more people in like Anthony Cumia.
[01:24:10.966 --> 01:24:15.331]  And just to go to Anthony Cumia real quick, I know that you're on Fox a lot.
[01:24:15.371 --> 01:24:16.833]  I see you on a lot on Sundays.
[01:24:16.873 --> 01:24:18.395]  You're on the show with Greg Gutfield.
[01:24:18.795 --> 01:24:22.219]  I'm just curious, you know, Greg, if I remember correctly, actually has talked about you before, Alex.
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:25.463]  I'm just curious, Anthony, do they say anything about us?
[01:24:25.483 --> 01:24:28.907]  Do they give you a hard time for coming on with the madman here sitting to my left?
[01:24:28.967 --> 01:24:30.229]  Or do they think it's cool?
[01:24:30.829 --> 01:24:43.700]  Alex, no, some people have said, yeah, what, oh, Alex, and then they make the face like, and you think, well, haven't you seen, how can you watch network news anymore or cable news and not go, oh my God, this is crap.
[01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:44.961]  This is garbage.
[01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:52.147]  It's like the movie, They Live, when we have the glasses on, we're able to see all the things that other people can't see.
[01:24:52.307 --> 01:24:56.010]  When I watch the news nowadays, I see the lies.
[01:24:56.050 --> 01:24:57.451]  You can see right through it.
[01:24:58.051 --> 01:25:00.433]  Put on these glasses or eat that trash can.
[01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:17.845]  You're not allowed to go on Alex Jones' show.
[01:25:17.985 --> 01:25:19.025]  All I'm doing is plugging them.
[01:25:19.305 --> 01:25:22.907]  I'm not trying to bring Fox down like the people internally at Fox are trying to do.
[01:25:22.967 --> 01:25:23.948]  Again, they don't get it.
[01:25:24.468 --> 01:25:26.109]  I want a free country.
[01:25:26.209 --> 01:25:27.209]  That's what I want.
[01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:29.470]  Anthony, I've been asking the questions and ranting here.
[01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:31.912]  I want to play a few clips and let you get back to your family.
[01:25:31.932 --> 01:25:32.432]  But first off...
[01:25:33.052 --> 01:25:36.495]  Uh, your house or whatever it is looks even cooler than your normal, uh, set.
[01:25:36.535 --> 01:25:37.395]  That looks like a fun place.
[01:25:37.415 --> 01:25:39.417]  You got Hillary and the dartboard there behind you?
[01:25:39.637 --> 01:25:41.198]  Yeah, yeah, Hillary's on the dartboard.
[01:25:41.258 --> 01:25:44.340]  I figured, uh... Can you try to throw one over your shoulder and hit her in the face?
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:48.623]  I'll give you a thousand dollars for your favorite charity if you can grab those darts and throw it over your shoulder.
[01:25:48.944 --> 01:25:50.104]  This is just offensive.
[01:25:50.465 --> 01:25:51.906]  I refuse to be a part of this.
[01:25:52.846 --> 01:25:54.408]  Shut this down immediately.
[01:25:54.428 --> 01:26:00.092]  Oh no, they brought it up in my custody battle that I have a dartboard in there in the warehouse of Hillary Clinton.
[01:26:00.793 --> 01:26:02.777]  When I came here... He has a dartboard!
[01:26:02.817 --> 01:26:05.502]  That was my favorite thing when I came here for my first visit was that dartboard.
[01:26:05.522 --> 01:26:06.163]  Sorry Anthony, go ahead.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.361]  Yeah, I can't believe they brought that up, like that's a big issue.
[01:26:10.581 --> 01:26:20.143]  I was saying there's no more important time than right now to support you over there at InfoWars, me at Compound Media, and other people that are trying to get the truth out there.
[01:26:20.203 --> 01:26:27.284]  We're the only people that really have, and it's weird to say, this amazing opportunity to put the truth out there.
[01:26:27.544 --> 01:26:29.324]  We're not beholden to anybody.
[01:26:29.344 --> 01:26:30.585]  You know why they're so scared, Anthony?
[01:26:30.845 --> 01:26:36.406]  If I was surfing through TV and I saw you, not even knowing who you are, guaranteed sitting at your bar at home, that's home, right?
[01:26:36.986 --> 01:26:38.027]  Or your desk or whatever it is.
[01:26:38.467 --> 01:26:40.508]  I would stop and watch because it's real!
[01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:46.372]  That's what people used to go to the bar or barbecue or square dancing and talk or go to the soapbox.
[01:26:46.572 --> 01:26:47.473]  We're bringing it back.
[01:26:47.513 --> 01:26:47.793]  Go ahead.
[01:26:48.414 --> 01:26:49.494]  Bringing it right back to that.
[01:26:49.574 --> 01:26:58.680]  And there's no more important time because there is nowhere else to get credible news anymore than what they're calling alternative and trying to discredit.
[01:26:59.061 --> 01:27:05.505]  And you know, I can't say enough how much of an example you are at how they're trying to bring you down.
[01:27:05.825 --> 01:27:08.286]  You're getting too popular, Alex.
[01:27:08.626 --> 01:27:13.408]  They're seeing that you're influencing a lot of people, and that's dangerous ground for them.
[01:27:13.808 --> 01:27:15.209]  Look at the end of the CNN story.
[01:27:15.269 --> 01:27:29.274]  Right-wing troll Mike Cernovich joins Professional with new hosting gig at InfoWars, and it says, while most of their reports may not be accurate, they can point to legitimate scoops corroborated by mainstream news outlets and evidence they should be trusting everything else.
[01:27:29.654 --> 01:27:30.814]  The infrastructure of truth and justice.
[01:27:49.099 --> 01:27:52.203]  We have to have compound media, not just grow but explode.
[01:27:52.423 --> 01:27:54.085]  We've got to have Infowars grow and explode.
[01:27:54.366 --> 01:27:55.367]  We've got to support Drudge.
[01:27:55.407 --> 01:27:57.530]  We hang together or we hang separate.
[01:27:58.731 --> 01:28:03.117]  When Breitbart gets their two-year-old free app deleted off iTunes...
[01:28:04.358 --> 01:28:05.659]  Because they just say you're racist.
[01:28:05.899 --> 01:28:10.543]  That's like they hit me in the stomach when they fire him off XM for saying cop killings wrong.
[01:28:10.623 --> 01:28:11.644]  That hits me in the stomach.
[01:28:11.905 --> 01:28:20.832]  I mean, don't people get, like if you see thugs killing your neighbor for no reason, you get hit in the stomach, you take it personal, you know, you get your gun, you go out there, you defend your neighbor.
[01:28:21.052 --> 01:28:24.355]  I mean, I don't understand how in the old days you saw your neighbor getting hurt, you did something.
[01:28:24.395 --> 01:28:27.798]  Nowadays you see women getting raped in the street, nobody helps them, people walk by.
[01:28:28.158 --> 01:28:29.560]  More and more it's this selfishness.
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:30.900]  Here's what you do now.
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:43.608]  You hold your phone up and then you tape and you yell going, someone call the police as you have a phone in your hand because it's more important to get the video than actually do something about the problem you're seeing.
[01:28:45.238 --> 01:28:45.578]  Exactly.
[01:28:45.598 --> 01:28:47.979]  They don't like it because we're motivated activist media.
[01:28:48.319 --> 01:28:53.141]  The Pentagon's great people on average, but the Pentagon and the whole Jade Helm thing was really about psyops, not an invasion.
[01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:55.081]  That was another media lie that I said that it was an invasion.
[01:28:55.401 --> 01:29:00.483]  They say we're worried about motivated individuals, nationalists, people that can be leaders.
[01:29:00.563 --> 01:29:01.563]  And it wasn't about violence.
[01:29:02.083 --> 01:29:09.286]  This is the leftists controlling the Pentagon under Obama a few years ago, saying we've got to learn how to deal with these empowered individuals.
[01:29:09.326 --> 01:29:10.166]  Who are they talking about?
[01:29:10.746 --> 01:29:27.740]  If 2016 was the year that alternative media took over, became the new media, became the dominant media, I'm hoping, just like I believe that that is true, in 2016 the new media, the alternative media became the main media, became the dominant media.
[01:29:28.341 --> 01:29:36.328]  The same people that made that possible, I'm hoping those same people in 2018 run for office, get into the United States government.
[01:29:36.548 --> 01:29:37.268]  That's what we need.
[01:29:37.329 --> 01:29:38.970]  That is the next plan of attack.
[01:29:39.130 --> 01:29:39.510]  All right.
[01:29:54.507 --> 01:29:56.069]  Trump is being drained by the swamp.
[01:29:56.430 --> 01:30:09.804]  He's doing real things that hurt the globalists, real things that make America great again, to empower us to not be ashamed to be nationalists, to control the border, 43% down illegals coming in, you know, killing TPP, this globalist deal that took control of our country.
[01:30:11.105 --> 01:30:14.206]  300 billion in new jobs in just the first few months.
[01:30:14.226 --> 01:30:17.287]  500,000 new jobs already just in the first 105 days.
[01:30:18.327 --> 01:30:23.208]  Just, you know, executive orders, cutting the funding of the IRS, cutting the UN funding by half.
[01:30:23.548 --> 01:30:30.970]  If I said it all, you know, leaking to us from the White House that they looted 300 billion out of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Obama.
[01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:31.751]  I mean, they're good.
[01:30:31.951 --> 01:30:32.691]  They're working with us.
[01:30:33.371 --> 01:30:36.552]  But he's got to pull from people to even fill the slots.
[01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:38.393]  They're blocking him.
[01:30:38.553 --> 01:30:40.614]  I don't want folks to get demoralized.
[01:30:41.295 --> 01:30:43.676]  But he's got to compromise to get a budget passed.
[01:30:44.677 --> 01:30:47.059]  So I'm not here apologizing for what Trump's done.
[01:30:47.299 --> 01:30:48.660]  They hate him more than ever though.
[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:49.620]  That's the proof he's good.
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:50.061]  What do you think?
[01:30:50.700 --> 01:30:55.983]  Hey, when he was on the campaign trail and saying what he wanted to do, that was what the people wanted to hear.
[01:30:56.323 --> 01:30:58.884]  And, sincerely, that's what he wants to do.
[01:30:59.324 --> 01:30:59.985]  Washington?
[01:31:00.305 --> 01:31:01.005]  What did we think?
[01:31:01.065 --> 01:31:07.028]  He was going to be able to go in there without any speed bumps and literally brick walls to try to get past.
[01:31:07.268 --> 01:31:09.550]  These are people that are setting their ways.
[01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:11.190]  They are cronies.
[01:31:11.210 --> 01:31:14.672]  It took Obama two years to pass Obamacare.
[01:31:14.892 --> 01:31:16.773]  He didn't get rid of it on day 65.
[01:31:17.033 --> 01:31:17.754]  They call him a failure.
[01:31:17.774 --> 01:31:17.994]  Sorry.
[01:31:18.674 --> 01:31:19.414]  Hell yeah!
[01:31:20.155 --> 01:31:23.456]  But yeah, he's gonna have to work with some of these people, which is unfortunate.
[01:31:23.696 --> 01:31:32.599]  But I'm disappointed, not in him, I'm disappointed in the GOP, who now has all the power we wanted, and they're still just bending over.
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:36.201]  And it's very disheartening to watch that.
[01:31:36.781 --> 01:31:37.201]  That's right.
[01:31:37.481 --> 01:31:40.463]  Since I mentioned it, I'm going to play the short Colbert clip and then one more thing.
[01:31:40.483 --> 01:31:48.328]  We're going to go to Roger Stone with breaking news on Fox Meltdown, Jared Kusher developments, controversy over Richard Grenell, and so much more.
[01:31:48.668 --> 01:31:50.670]  Anthony Cumea, compoundmedia.com is with us.
[01:31:51.050 --> 01:31:55.893]  Of course, we have Owen Shore, one of our great investigative journalists and anchors here, and Roger Stone is getting ready right now.
[01:31:55.953 --> 01:31:58.635]  But here's a short clip of Colbert as they eat their own.
[01:31:58.655 --> 01:31:58.975]  Here it is.
[01:31:59.435 --> 01:32:01.356]  I think, actually, I've been very consistent.
[01:32:01.396 --> 01:32:07.859]  You know, it's very funny when the fake media goes out, you know, which we call the mainstream media, which sometimes, I must say, is you.
[01:32:08.559 --> 01:32:10.420]  You mean personally, or...?
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:11.100]  Your show.
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:11.801]  I love your show.
[01:32:12.061 --> 01:32:13.381]  I call it Deface the Nation.
[01:32:14.122 --> 01:32:14.542]  Really?
[01:32:16.723 --> 01:32:24.867]  Donald Trump, John Dickerson, is a fair-minded journalist, and one of the most competent people who will ever walk into your office, and you treat him like that?
[01:32:25.632 --> 01:32:27.734]  Now, John Dickerson has way too much... Treat him like what?
[01:32:27.754 --> 01:32:28.435]  He had a smile.
[01:32:28.996 --> 01:32:30.798]  They hate it that we stand up to their bullying crap.
[01:32:30.838 --> 01:32:31.158]  Here we go.
[01:32:31.338 --> 01:32:34.061]  But I, sir, am no John Dickerson.
[01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:35.883]  No, you're a fake that rings out the teleprompter.
[01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:41.709]  And when you... I'm, look, I challenge you to come on live.
[01:32:41.729 --> 01:32:42.470]  We have huge ratings.
[01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:43.031]  We won't do it.
[01:32:44.462 --> 01:32:46.004]  I think he likes you, Alex.
[01:32:46.244 --> 01:32:49.587]  Let me introduce you to something we call the Tiffany Way.
[01:32:49.927 --> 01:32:53.770]  When you insult one member of the CBS family, you insult us all.
[01:32:54.171 --> 01:32:54.791]  Bazinga.
[01:32:55.131 --> 01:32:55.512]  Alright?
[01:32:56.633 --> 01:32:59.315]  Here we go.
[01:32:59.515 --> 01:33:01.577]  Alright?
[01:33:01.637 --> 01:33:04.239]  Mr. Trump, your presidency, I love your presidency.
[01:33:04.459 --> 01:33:06.141]  I call it disgrace the nation.
[01:33:07.423 --> 01:33:09.024]  You know, it's peer pressure.
[01:33:09.064 --> 01:33:11.186]  We could have a studio audience and the laugh track goes on.
[01:33:11.206 --> 01:33:11.826]  We say laugh.
[01:33:12.307 --> 01:33:13.548]  We could play a laugh track.
[01:33:13.908 --> 01:33:14.609]  He didn't write that.
[01:33:14.669 --> 01:33:15.449]  It's all peer pressure.
[01:33:15.509 --> 01:33:16.570]  No, he's reading off a teleprompter.
[01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:16.830]  Here we go.
[01:33:19.694 --> 01:33:20.434]  Oh, he says witty.
[01:33:20.755 --> 01:33:21.255]  He didn't write that.
[01:33:21.275 --> 01:33:21.835]  He has like 20 writers.
[01:33:21.855 --> 01:33:23.316]  He literally has like 20 writers.
[01:33:23.356 --> 01:33:24.116]  That's enough.
[01:33:24.136 --> 01:33:27.177]  Again, these guys have ushered in such a tyranny that now he may get fired.
[01:33:45.973 --> 01:33:47.934]  For his own cult, Anthony?
[01:34:04.106 --> 01:34:07.269]  Ah, homophobe, racist, sexist, misogynist!
[01:34:07.609 --> 01:34:19.157]  And if we don't care anymore that they're calling us that, and we've gone about our own business and started our own media, they have to go after someone, and the only people left are the idiots that are still around them.
[01:34:19.417 --> 01:34:19.978]  And by the way,
[01:34:20.698 --> 01:34:23.879]  I remember the controversy over his writers being mainly men, so I said 20.
[01:34:24.239 --> 01:34:25.960]  I'm sorry, it's 19 full-time.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:32.682]  But then they have, when you read deeper in the articles, sometimes when it rotates through, they've got whole other groups that are writing and submitting from CBS.
[01:34:32.702 --> 01:34:38.783]  So he probably has over 100, but 19 full-time writers, some of them paid upwards of $300,000 a year.
[01:34:38.803 --> 01:34:46.325]  Can you imagine if I had 19 writers for an hour-long show, 45 minutes of broadcast?
[01:34:46.365 --> 01:34:47.786]  I mean, this is crazy!
[01:34:48.326 --> 01:34:51.308]  How could they ever compete with people that actually have brains?
[01:34:51.728 --> 01:34:54.049]  You have zero riders or zero teleprompters, by the way.
[01:34:54.069 --> 01:34:55.370]  Well, neither does you, Kumi, either.
[01:34:55.450 --> 01:34:56.350]  Compoundmedia.com.
[01:34:56.370 --> 01:34:56.971]  I want to do one more thing.
[01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:57.771]  We're going to Roger Stone.
[01:34:58.471 --> 01:35:04.515]  We have a big premiere debunking Pile of Manure Part 2, an inconvenient walrus.
[01:35:05.115 --> 01:35:06.556]  I mean, this thing, I've seen the trailer.
[01:35:06.596 --> 01:35:07.496]  I read the synopsis online.
[01:35:07.516 --> 01:35:08.417]  I'm about to destroy it.
[01:35:08.677 --> 01:35:10.318]  Special report we put together the last two days.
[01:35:10.338 --> 01:35:13.039]  We're going to premiere it, and then we're going to have Millie Weaver come in here.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:19.481]  The Armenian Genocide's a big deal to me, because I've read a lot of books about World War II.
[01:35:19.521 --> 01:35:28.203]  I got fascinated with it when I was in junior high, and I've read hundreds of books about World War II, then I read other books about World War I, other stuff, but my dad would never, he'd never really buy me much.
[01:35:28.223 --> 01:35:35.805]  He made me get jobs when I was about 12, but if I wanted timeline encyclopedias of World War II, World War I, or the West, remember all those ads on TV for those who were too young?
[01:35:35.945 --> 01:35:37.566]  You'll remember Anthony, and he would just buy them.
[01:35:37.606 --> 01:35:41.246]  I could say, I want this, sure, buy it, because he came from the country, but they didn't even have TV.
[01:35:41.306 --> 01:35:42.727]  Alex, Alex, remember that?
[01:35:43.687 --> 01:35:46.810]  Once, he was so mean he once shot a man just for snoring.
[01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:50.332]  That's right, exactly, the ads for like the little leather-bound things in the West.
[01:35:50.392 --> 01:35:51.033]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:51.053 --> 01:35:52.054]  He bought me like 20 of those.
[01:35:52.994 --> 01:35:58.379]  So I knew that Hitler wrote about the Armenian genocide in World War I when Turkey was on the side of Germany, where they killed...
[01:35:59.247 --> 01:36:00.068]  Over a million and a half.
[01:36:00.368 --> 01:36:01.729]  The conservative number is 1.3 million.
[01:36:01.749 --> 01:36:03.751]  Almost all the Christians in Turkey were Armenian.
[01:36:03.771 --> 01:36:05.272]  One of the oldest Christian groups.
[01:36:05.812 --> 01:36:10.696]  Since the Muslims took over Constantinople, you know, hundreds of years before and changed the name to Istanbul.
[01:36:11.617 --> 01:36:13.018]  So, this is a Muslim takeover.
[01:36:13.338 --> 01:36:13.979]  The religion of peace.
[01:36:14.519 --> 01:36:16.821]  So, I went and saw the movie Friday and it just blew me away.
[01:36:16.841 --> 01:36:19.644]  It's all based on historical AP reports of a writer that was there.
[01:36:19.984 --> 01:36:20.464]  All happened.
[01:36:20.544 --> 01:36:21.265]  Eyewitness accounts.
[01:36:22.065 --> 01:36:22.906]  People surviving.
[01:36:23.707 --> 01:36:28.331]  And then I saw Christian Bale running around criticizing everybody.
[01:36:29.389 --> 01:36:34.613]  Who doesn't want to bring in unvetted Muslims when he's in a movie playing a hero who says the Muslims are coming, they're gonna kill you!
[01:36:34.793 --> 01:36:36.054]  Don't you understand it's a jihad!
[01:36:36.194 --> 01:36:37.315]  They're gonna murder every Christian!
[01:36:37.975 --> 01:36:41.158]  Meanwhile he attacked me, he attacked Cernovich, he said we're these horrible, you know, people.
[01:36:41.638 --> 01:36:42.098]  All this stuff.
[01:36:42.118 --> 01:36:46.682]  And here he is playing, though, a real hero that fought against radical Islam, killing people.
[01:36:47.442 --> 01:36:50.964]  And again, Hitler modeled the Holocaust that killed so many groups.
[01:36:51.685 --> 01:36:52.685]  People deny the Holocaust happened.
[01:36:52.706 --> 01:36:53.206]  Give me a break, folks.
[01:36:53.246 --> 01:36:54.367]  I've read the writings of Hitler.
[01:36:54.387 --> 01:37:00.070]  He said, we're killing all the... He killed Christians, Lutherans, Catholics, Jews, anybody.
[01:37:01.111 --> 01:37:02.652]  Ukrainians, Russians, anybody.
[01:37:03.112 --> 01:37:03.432]  Okay?
[01:37:04.032 --> 01:37:11.015]  And this went on, and then Christian Bale comes out and says Trump's setting up a dictatorship when he's elected, and he plays this movie.
[01:37:11.035 --> 01:37:12.055]  And then you have the Young Turks.
[01:37:12.395 --> 01:37:16.196]  The Young Turk Party were the ones that went and killed the Armenians.
[01:37:16.556 --> 01:37:20.798]  And then the Young Turks have their liberal show, funded by Qatar, on TV.
[01:37:21.078 --> 01:37:24.359]  And when you know history, it's like you said, we have the sunglasses, Anthony.
[01:37:24.899 --> 01:37:26.440]  Anthony Cumia, compoundmedia.com.
[01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:30.941]  We have the sunglasses, we see it, and that's why we yell and scream, because it's ridiculous.
[01:37:31.383 --> 01:37:33.657]  Your comment on that and I'm going to play the trailer while we get Stone ready.
[01:37:35.105 --> 01:37:41.608]  I love bringing this up because a lot of people ask, hey, how can I verify what's going on when all the news out there on mainstream media is fake?
[01:37:41.888 --> 01:37:43.529]  I say look to history.
[01:37:43.890 --> 01:37:46.371]  Look at your news and then look to history.
[01:37:46.511 --> 01:37:59.278]  World War I, between the two wars, World War II, and you will see how some of these things just continue to happen and it'll give you a little more accuracy of what you're reading and where we see things going.
[01:37:59.739 --> 01:38:01.060]  And then you see the young Turks.
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:11.968]  On TV, knowing full well that's the name of the group of Islamic Jihad that took over and did this, they're the ones like the brown shirts with the Nazis that beat up and rounded up the first groups, and it's all a big joke to them.
[01:38:12.028 --> 01:38:17.593]  It's like, with Muslims, they're either heretics that are being bullied by other Muslims, or they're in on the joke.
[01:38:17.693 --> 01:38:22.297]  It's an authoritarian takeover arm, and I was never the Islamophobe 15 years ago.
[01:38:22.337 --> 01:38:24.259]  I didn't like it, but I didn't want to have wars with them.
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:27.685]  But now I see Europe being flooded, all this stuff.
[01:38:28.707 --> 01:38:32.012]  You know, I'm being sued for saying, don't bring in unvetted refugees.
[01:38:32.073 --> 01:38:33.675]  I mean, they really have a lot of arrogance.
[01:38:34.841 --> 01:38:36.101]  It's astounding.
[01:38:36.121 --> 01:38:42.542]  And then when you see people, progressives again, where feminists for Islam and stuff.
[01:38:42.762 --> 01:38:44.403]  Like, are these people for real?
[01:38:44.623 --> 01:38:48.904]  Do they understand the emergency we're in and that Europe is in?
[01:38:49.104 --> 01:38:50.144]  Like, look at Europe.
[01:38:50.504 --> 01:38:55.425]  If you want to see what the potential is for our country, look to Europe.
[01:38:55.465 --> 01:38:59.925]  Look at some of these amazing countries that are now being overrun and invaded.
[01:39:00.125 --> 01:39:02.566]  It's an invasion and no one really wants to see it.
[01:39:03.186 --> 01:39:10.307]  Earlier we showed a tape I did yesterday, where USA Today had the headline, I'm going from memory, but pull it up guys, gals, if you can.
[01:39:12.528 --> 01:39:16.349]  In Trump's America, the hijab is now a symbol of resistance to Trump.
[01:39:16.829 --> 01:39:21.670]  Now I was out months ago at women's marches funded by Soros, one march, 260 million.
[01:39:22.190 --> 01:39:23.810]  And it was over a million in DC.
[01:39:24.250 --> 01:39:27.891]  Nobody was blocking them going to the mall, the day before they were trying to beat us up trying to go hear Trump speak.
[01:39:28.431 --> 01:39:37.898]  The news line said nobody was there, it was the biggest crowd ever, and they're handing out plastic hijabs, and the women are all putting it on, and I'm like telling people they don't believe it.
[01:39:37.958 --> 01:39:42.601]  Then, three months later, hijab becomes symbol of resistance feminism in the age of Trump.
[01:39:42.801 --> 01:39:44.963]  I mean, Anthony, you can't make this up!
[01:39:46.224 --> 01:39:47.705]  I wish you could make it up.
[01:39:47.805 --> 01:39:49.567]  I wish this was something that was made up.
[01:39:49.847 --> 01:39:53.531]  They don't want to acknowledge the oppression, the amazing oppression.
[01:39:53.991 --> 01:39:56.834]  Feminists here in this country talk about not having rights.
[01:39:57.134 --> 01:39:59.857]  What rights don't they have here in this country?
[01:39:59.877 --> 01:40:01.959]  The truth is they're anti-American cult.
[01:40:02.279 --> 01:40:02.699]  Yes!
[01:40:03.099 --> 01:40:03.720]  That's what it is.
[01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.020]  So they talk about Islam.
[01:40:05.261 --> 01:40:08.042]  How about things like genital mutilation?
[01:40:08.462 --> 01:40:09.383]  Oh, we're not having that!
[01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:11.744]  We're not having doctors indicted for it here in the US!
[01:40:11.924 --> 01:40:13.365]  Here in this country!
[01:40:13.725 --> 01:40:17.247]  When will somebody see that this is an issue?
[01:40:17.927 --> 01:40:18.427]  Absolutely.
[01:40:18.447 --> 01:40:19.008]  I mean, I've got...
[01:40:19.827 --> 01:40:23.408]  I got three daughters.
[01:40:23.488 --> 01:40:26.869]  I'm so sick of feminists that hate women, want to control them.
[01:40:27.149 --> 01:40:33.050]  I've found feminists mainly are ugly women that want to boss other women around and generally like women, which I'm not blaming them for.
[01:40:33.130 --> 01:40:34.211]  God, I would if I was a woman too.
[01:40:34.571 --> 01:40:37.592]  But it's literally like women trying to shark in and push men around.
[01:40:38.012 --> 01:40:39.612]  I've been out with Shane Steiner, my good buddy.
[01:40:40.172 --> 01:40:42.073]  Hey, can Roger stay ten minutes the next hour because I've cut him short.
[01:40:42.093 --> 01:40:42.573]  I apologize.
[01:40:43.499 --> 01:40:44.059]  He's a sweetheart.
[01:40:44.079 --> 01:40:44.219]  Good.
[01:40:44.239 --> 01:40:45.079]  We're going to Roger right now.
[01:40:45.359 --> 01:40:46.000]  But I've got to say this.
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:47.520]  I don't care about lesbians.
[01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:48.260]  I don't care if you're gay.
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:49.481]  I literally am a libertarian.
[01:40:49.901 --> 01:40:59.503]  But then they want me to accept their gun control agenda, everything else that goes along with it, as if if you're gay, you're supposed to be this, you know, liberal, globalist idiot who loves Islam and all this other crap.
[01:40:59.543 --> 01:41:00.463]  We throw you off buildings.
[01:41:00.703 --> 01:41:02.764]  But my buddy, Shane Steiner, has got a beauty queen wife.
[01:41:02.864 --> 01:41:05.065]  I mean, you see her, you know, she looks like Meryl Monroe.
[01:41:05.805 --> 01:41:09.046]  And my kids and his kids, our daughters, like to go play bowling together.
[01:41:09.246 --> 01:41:09.866]  He's got two daughters.
[01:41:10.666 --> 01:41:33.133]  And so we go to this nice bowling place called Main Event and they got video games and food and everything and they don't drink beer and well Shane doesn't drink beer but whatever I'm drinking beer and I've been there repeatedly and we have lesbians with duck's ass James Dean haircuts I don't know how they do it wearing wearing white shirts and blue jeans and and and boots um and they come over
[01:41:34.844 --> 01:41:43.786]  And they've got cigarette packs in their arms, and they literally walk over while we're playing pool after we bowled, and going, hey baby, how you doing?
[01:41:43.926 --> 01:41:51.948]  No man, and Shane can like bench press, he can bench press 400 pounds like 30 times, okay?
[01:41:52.308 --> 01:41:54.648]  He can like beat Tim Kelly a lot on the mat now.
[01:41:54.708 --> 01:41:57.009]  He's like 43, same age as me, total badass.
[01:41:57.029 --> 01:41:57.889]  He's taking caveman.
[01:41:58.009 --> 01:41:58.729]  Okay, caveman.
[01:41:59.269 --> 01:42:04.251]  The point is, is that, you know, his brother's a world champion, dad's a world champion bull rider, he can kick all their ass.
[01:42:04.731 --> 01:42:11.274]  The point is, is that they literally are coming up to us, and I'm not a small guy, like, muscling in for his woman.
[01:42:11.734 --> 01:42:23.300]  And I'm telling you, they want it to be a man's world, they want us to roll over and die, and then they're gonna be men, and I'm watching these lesbians with good-looking women groveling to them, and the lesbians are like, watch it, or I'll smack ya.
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:28.562]  And it's like, men don't act like that, they're acting like what they think men act like, Anthony, sorry.
[01:42:29.495 --> 01:42:33.477]  Oh my God, yeah, it's a poor imitation on each side.
[01:42:33.497 --> 01:42:43.323]  A lot of men these days are acting like traditional women, and a lot of women acting like they believe a traditional man would act.
[01:42:43.363 --> 01:42:46.285]  So, I don't know, it must have been hilarious to watch.
[01:42:47.846 --> 01:42:49.066]  All right, anyways, I don't mean to be ranting.
[01:42:49.126 --> 01:42:51.268]  Anthony Comey, you're so nice to sit here while I've been ranting.
[01:42:51.308 --> 01:42:51.948]  God bless you.
[01:42:52.348 --> 01:42:55.690]  Compoundmedia.com, and I love getting you and your great crew on any time you want.
[01:42:55.730 --> 01:42:56.530]  Thank you for hosting.
[01:42:57.111 --> 01:42:58.852]  Every couple weeks with us, I hope to get you on more often.
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:00.480]  Alex, I love it.
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:01.121]  I love you.
[01:43:01.181 --> 01:43:02.141]  Love what you're doing, man.
[01:43:02.241 --> 01:43:05.562]  Keep it up and, you know, let's keep this battle going, man.
[01:43:06.342 --> 01:43:07.322]  Thank you so much, brother.
[01:43:07.342 --> 01:43:07.863]  God bless you.
[01:43:08.063 --> 01:43:11.824]  Again, we're going to Roger Stone after I play this trailer for The Promise.
[01:43:11.864 --> 01:43:12.824]  Everybody should see this.
[01:43:13.184 --> 01:43:15.865]  Everybody should also get Roger Stone's book, The Making of a President.
[01:43:15.885 --> 01:43:21.027]  Give it to friends, family, and neighbors that are brainwashed so they can see the truth of who we are and understand what Trump's trying to do.
[01:43:21.087 --> 01:43:22.827]  But I'm going to thank you for being here with me, brother.
[01:43:22.847 --> 01:43:25.048]  I'm going to go to Roger Stone for the next 20 minutes or so.
[01:43:25.268 --> 01:43:27.429]  Then I'm going to premiere a special report on Al Gore.
[01:43:28.379 --> 01:43:29.360]  Tell me about Constantinople.
[01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:29.800]  It can be magical.
[01:43:52.689 --> 01:43:59.773]  In the Grand Bazaar, you could buy the finest fashions from Paris and London, the latest automobiles from America.
[01:44:00.294 --> 01:44:01.434]  It can be horrible, too.
[01:44:01.874 --> 01:44:03.135]  Just like any great city.
[01:44:03.575 --> 01:44:04.776]  Were you happy there?
[01:44:06.777 --> 01:44:07.638]  It was a different life.
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:13.541]  A toast to old friends and you.
[01:44:13.901 --> 01:44:14.702]  Christopher Myers.
[01:44:14.902 --> 01:44:17.263]  Chris is a star reporter for the Associated Press.
[01:44:17.484 --> 01:44:19.685]  May I introduce Mademoiselle Anikosar.
[01:44:20.205 --> 01:44:21.486]  You're going to become a doctor.
[01:44:22.313 --> 01:44:23.434]  I hear a French accent.
[01:44:23.594 --> 01:44:26.155]  And I've been in Paris for many years, but I'm a proud Armenian.
[01:44:28.136 --> 01:44:29.916]  Mikhail, you make me feel like I'm home.
[01:44:30.637 --> 01:44:33.458]  These Germans want your Sultan to declare... Holy War!
[01:44:33.938 --> 01:44:37.880]  Oh my God, what was that?
[01:44:41.962 --> 01:44:45.703]  It's very dangerous for Armenians right now.
[01:44:45.783 --> 01:44:46.824]  This is our opportunity.
[01:44:47.324 --> 01:44:49.425]  We will restore the great Ottoman Empire.
[01:44:51.368 --> 01:44:52.409]  We cannot be here!
[01:44:52.449 --> 01:44:53.110]  We must leave!
[01:44:54.171 --> 01:44:56.333]  What is the Associated Press doing here, Mr. Myers?
[01:44:57.113 --> 01:44:58.695]  Reporting on the war.
[01:44:58.975 --> 01:45:02.218]  There is no war here.
[01:45:03.299 --> 01:45:06.362]  Merely the evacuation of the civilian population to a safer region.
[01:45:07.984 --> 01:45:11.727]  You are using this so-called relocation as a cover.
[01:45:23.973 --> 01:45:24.854]  You trust no one.
[01:45:25.494 --> 01:45:36.482]  I have to get us out of here before there's no time left.
[01:45:36.542 --> 01:45:39.984]  He wants us to help his family escape.
[01:45:40.004 --> 01:45:40.605]  We have to help them.
[01:45:45.192 --> 01:45:47.515]  Alright folks, the full trailer is obviously online.
[01:45:47.795 --> 01:45:50.498]  Very powerful film, and I'm not getting money for showing you this.
[01:45:50.518 --> 01:45:55.924]  So if you need to see what the Muslims did, this is so accurate off an AP writer that documented it all, who was there.
[01:45:57.352 --> 01:45:58.693]  And what's crazy is Christian Bell does that.
[01:45:58.733 --> 01:46:01.495]  Now I'm going to go to Roger Stone until about 10-15 after and then we're going to premiere this.
[01:46:01.515 --> 01:46:02.536]  But I've got to say something.
[01:46:02.576 --> 01:46:08.180]  I wasn't going to talk about this because I get attacked a good 50 times a day in print, you know, every day on national news.
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:13.784]  But they had this Charlie Worzel guy, or Weasel guy, follow me around the last few months.
[01:46:14.244 --> 01:46:14.725]  One of many.
[01:46:15.545 --> 01:46:17.887]  And his article's called, Alex Jones will never stop being Alex Jones.
[01:46:17.927 --> 01:46:20.189]  I just scanned over this in the last 10 minutes since it came out.
[01:46:20.589 --> 01:46:21.550]  It is literal.
[01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:23.730]  Literal fiction.
[01:46:23.770 --> 01:46:26.051]  He sent me all these questions, I refuse to answer them today.
[01:46:27.171 --> 01:46:31.192]  Final questions, because it was all just so much and it just didn't even have anything to do with reality.
[01:46:31.992 --> 01:46:33.992]  And look at this, I just opened it to page 6.
[01:46:35.272 --> 01:46:38.753]  He just kept saying, oh my God, if Obama loses, we're out of business.
[01:46:40.893 --> 01:46:41.773]  Talking about 2012.
[01:46:41.993 --> 01:46:44.134]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:45.194 --> 01:46:46.814]  They're supposed to go talk to former employees.
[01:46:47.134 --> 01:46:50.815]  This is the biggest load of crap the world has ever seen.
[01:46:54.282 --> 01:46:59.690]  It goes on to say, but others close to Jones during that time said that despite a growing audience, the broadcaster was insecure.
[01:46:59.830 --> 01:47:00.571]  Insecure?
[01:47:01.172 --> 01:47:05.659]  Two former colleagues said Jones reserved his greater resentment for Rush Limbaugh.
[01:47:07.133 --> 01:47:14.976]  The jealousy was so intense that Jones began to crib his now famous Crushed Gravel voice from the talk radio legend.
[01:47:15.256 --> 01:47:15.716]  Crib it!
[01:47:16.256 --> 01:47:17.277]  Limbaugh doesn't have a voice like me.
[01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:18.837]  He has a big, booming, sweet voice.
[01:47:19.037 --> 01:47:19.437]  Mine's fry.
[01:47:19.737 --> 01:47:28.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I spent a quarter million dollars on Rush Limbaugh advertising books and videos and supplements trying to prop him up when they're trying to bring him down.
[01:47:28.461 --> 01:47:31.242]  GCN put me on 18, 19 years ago.
[01:47:31.362 --> 01:47:32.962]  I wanted to be on at night like I was.
[01:47:33.002 --> 01:47:34.383]  They took me off, put me on during the day.
[01:47:34.763 --> 01:47:35.263]  I hated it.
[01:47:36.451 --> 01:47:48.056]  I have, I am not in comp, everyone knows I'm not in competition with anybody except the globalists to stop them and I just open this up and they just have anonymous people what, you know, I'm raping, you know, warthogs now?
[01:47:48.436 --> 01:47:50.777]  I mean, I just flipped through it, it's total crap!
[01:47:51.778 --> 01:47:55.079]  Excuse me, and I won't talk about myself all day, but God, it's getting crazy.
[01:47:55.759 --> 01:47:59.341]  You know, the nighttime shows, the comedy shows, everything.
[01:48:00.785 --> 01:48:03.449]  Made-for-TV movies, everything, just attacking.
[01:48:03.629 --> 01:48:07.735]  Only X-Files said that they think I'm a good guy and had a good character in the show, they said, based on me.
[01:48:07.755 --> 01:48:10.920]  And I don't want to make it about me, but they are obsessed, and then I...
[01:48:12.264 --> 01:48:13.024]  I'm going to go to Roger Stone.
[01:48:13.044 --> 01:48:13.725]  I apologize, Jim.
[01:48:13.745 --> 01:48:14.705]  Stonecoldtruth.com.
[01:48:14.725 --> 01:48:19.268]  I got here late and there's a bunch of stuff happening and I wanted to get the other guest on and we're pushing things back a little bit.
[01:48:19.288 --> 01:48:22.269]  He's got a bunch of breaking news here, but this is buy our products.
[01:48:22.630 --> 01:48:22.910]  Get them.
[01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:23.390]  You need them.
[01:48:23.410 --> 01:48:23.970]  They're excellent.
[01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:25.151]  They're all the best nutraceuticals.
[01:48:25.431 --> 01:48:26.872]  Buy a Molon Labe t-shirt.
[01:48:26.892 --> 01:48:28.573]  Buy a Trump 2020 shirt.
[01:48:28.773 --> 01:48:30.234]  It's better than Globalist, isn't it?
[01:48:30.254 --> 01:48:30.974]  Yeah.
[01:48:31.074 --> 01:48:32.695]  Support us because we're funded by you.
[01:48:32.715 --> 01:48:36.537]  We're not funded by Jordan Soros and the big money and stimulus money like MSNBC.
[01:48:36.937 --> 01:48:38.378]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:48:38.638 --> 01:48:39.459]  We're in their face.
[01:48:39.499 --> 01:48:40.559]  They're trying to bring us down.
[01:48:40.599 --> 01:48:42.061]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:48:42.301 --> 01:48:52.408]  But we're doing this 30-hour broadcast to help raise extra capital, to expand and add and launch like 16, 18 hours of live TV, radio, and reach so many people because they're trying to shut me down.
[01:48:52.948 --> 01:48:55.811]  Conservatism, nationalism is the new counterculture.
[01:48:56.091 --> 01:48:57.712]  Paul Watson's new shirt's about to sell out.
[01:48:58.092 --> 01:49:00.654]  Seed Vaults, Survival Gear, great products.
[01:49:01.315 --> 01:49:02.916]  Really, it's close to a thousand items or more.
[01:49:03.476 --> 01:49:04.657]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:49:04.957 --> 01:49:06.318]  Shop with the good guys today.
[01:49:06.698 --> 01:49:08.319]  Let them know they're not gonna shut us down.
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.122]  We're actually growing in the face of this, but they just keep intensifying, intensifying.
[01:49:12.382 --> 01:49:15.044]  So I want to really supercharge in this fight.
[01:49:15.064 --> 01:49:15.524]  I want to win.
[01:49:33.456 --> 01:49:39.958]  Well, first of all, Alex, let me say I didn't like you until I saw the Hillary Clinton dartboard in your office.
[01:49:40.318 --> 01:49:43.739]  And I knew we were kindred spirits immediately.
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:48.581]  That which does not kill you makes you stronger, Alex.
[01:49:48.661 --> 01:50:00.145]  And I, in 40 years in American politics, and seeing the vituperation that was used against Richard Nixon, I have never seen a public campaign to take down a public
[01:50:00.145 --> 01:50:00.765]  I saw it!
[01:50:00.785 --> 01:50:01.246]  I saw it!
[01:50:01.366 --> 01:50:02.066]  It's incredible!
[01:50:02.526 --> 01:50:04.387]  And they won't let you ever testify!
[01:50:24.397 --> 01:50:26.740]  Yeah, no, they just continue to malign me.
[01:50:27.901 --> 01:50:29.383]  We're in discussion with the U.S.
[01:50:29.423 --> 01:50:33.027]  Senate staff, but, you know, they want me to come in and talk to staff.
[01:50:33.107 --> 01:50:38.513]  No, I'll come in and talk to the Senators, the exact same Senators who disparage me.
[01:50:39.294 --> 01:50:41.156]  So why are they calling you a Russian spy?
[01:50:41.216 --> 01:50:42.657]  Why are they poisoning you with polonium?
[01:50:42.697 --> 01:50:44.179]  Why are they after you and me so much?
[01:50:44.439 --> 01:50:45.801]  Why is it in the... because let's talk about it.
[01:50:46.001 --> 01:50:49.204]  Why is it in the WikiLeaks take down Roger Stone?
[01:50:49.264 --> 01:50:54.690]  Why is it in the Inside Veritas Project where they say, oh, we took down the MVP, Roger Stone?
[01:50:54.810 --> 01:50:55.871]  Why do they hate you so much?
[01:50:56.111 --> 01:50:57.372]  What is it you and I are doing?
[01:50:58.053 --> 01:50:59.675]  Because some weeks you're getting attacked more than I am.
[01:50:59.715 --> 01:51:01.657]  It's like Trump's more than us, than you and I the most.
[01:51:01.957 --> 01:51:06.481]  Like you said with Nixon, it was over time they were demonizing him, but nothing this intense.
[01:51:06.622 --> 01:51:07.603]  What is going on here?
[01:51:07.843 --> 01:51:08.744]  What are they so scared of?
[01:51:09.971 --> 01:51:21.833]  Our effectiveness, the fact that we are resisting the new world order and we show no signs whatsoever of rolling over and going away quietly, because that's not going to happen.
[01:51:22.774 --> 01:51:28.615]  Working with a number of other activists, I have now helped launch FreeOurInternet.org.
[01:51:29.215 --> 01:51:35.076]  This is going to be the tip of the spear where we can gather those like
[01:51:35.436 --> 01:51:39.460]  Yourself, Cernovich, Breitbart, Daily Caller, Stone Cold Truth.
[01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.122]  We have confirmed Google censorship.
[01:51:41.142 --> 01:51:41.782]  Let's break down.
[01:51:41.822 --> 01:51:42.923]  We need to get Trump's attention.
[01:51:42.943 --> 01:51:44.084]  He needs to do something about this.
[01:51:44.725 --> 01:51:45.666]  Yeah, there's no question.
[01:51:45.706 --> 01:51:47.027]  They are trying to kneecap us.
[01:51:47.648 --> 01:51:51.592]  They are using a dozen technological techniques.
[01:51:52.452 --> 01:52:04.522]  Between the so-called Ministry of Truth, the national censorship board that was set up and authorized by Barack Obama in 2016, that's now bearing fruit.
[01:52:04.582 --> 01:52:09.906]  They're now using federal money to pay for these third-party lefty groups.
[01:52:10.834 --> 01:52:22.783]  And when Media Matters for America and some woman who works there named Clyder, you know, stalks my wife, stalks me, and I object to it on Twitter, well then I'm beating up on women.
[01:52:22.863 --> 01:52:26.305]  No, I treat women exactly the same as I treat men.
[01:52:26.425 --> 01:52:33.610]  I believe women who are active in politics should be able to be criticized just like you would criticize men.
[01:52:33.690 --> 01:52:35.652]  But the left doesn't like it.
[01:52:36.352 --> 01:52:37.213]  And they're on the run.
[01:52:37.313 --> 01:52:38.533]  They know they're on the run.
[01:52:38.874 --> 01:52:52.502]  Whether it is an antitrust enforcement by the Trump Justice Department, or a class action suit, or a general public uprising, we're not going to let the toothpaste be put back in the tube.
[01:52:52.822 --> 01:52:56.745]  We are not going to have our free communications handicapped.
[01:52:57.045 --> 01:53:05.010]  We are not going to return to the days when ABC and NBC and CBS had a stranglehold
[01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:08.931]  A monopoly on political discourse.
[01:53:09.031 --> 01:53:11.172]  Those days are not going to return.
[01:53:11.592 --> 01:53:14.093]  And we're going to fight to make sure they don't return.
[01:53:14.453 --> 01:53:16.914]  And that's why this character assassination.
[01:53:17.354 --> 01:53:19.014]  There's another one tonight in the St.
[01:53:19.054 --> 01:53:20.135]  Petersburg Times.
[01:53:20.855 --> 01:53:24.016]  This one says that I had nothing to do with the Brooks Brothers riot.
[01:53:24.776 --> 01:53:25.737]  I'm not ashamed of it.
[01:53:26.137 --> 01:53:34.022]  Yes, we stopped the Democrats from recounting the same group of ballots for the third time in Miami-Dade County.
[01:53:34.042 --> 01:53:36.264]  It was citizen action.
[01:53:37.124 --> 01:53:44.009]  But you get this constant, you know, leak of falsehoods and vituperation.
[01:53:44.049 --> 01:53:45.690]  And of course, you know, when a U.S.
[01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:50.153]  senator calls you out and says you're a traitor, well, that's a very special moment.
[01:53:52.048 --> 01:53:55.692]  And again, to the listeners, we've got so much important news to cover, and we do cover it.
[01:53:55.732 --> 01:53:56.653]  We break so much of it.
[01:53:56.673 --> 01:53:57.534]  You break tons of it.
[01:53:57.574 --> 01:53:58.375]  Our guests break it.
[01:53:59.136 --> 01:54:00.117]  We care about America.
[01:54:00.157 --> 01:54:00.978]  We just want prosperity.
[01:54:00.998 --> 01:54:02.440]  We don't want to be slaves of the globalists.
[01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:05.483]  And everything we've talked about's come out now.
[01:54:05.803 --> 01:54:06.704]  Globalism's admitted.
[01:54:06.745 --> 01:54:07.345]  World government.
[01:54:07.766 --> 01:54:08.567]  So they don't know what to do.
[01:54:08.627 --> 01:54:09.568]  Just target the messengers.
[01:54:09.608 --> 01:54:10.989]  That's why we're live here saying...
[01:54:11.730 --> 01:54:13.371]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com if you haven't gotten it.
[01:54:13.391 --> 01:54:14.232]  Get Roger Stone's book.
[01:54:14.292 --> 01:54:15.152]  Go buy a t-shirt.
[01:54:15.172 --> 01:54:16.613]  Sign up for auto-ship at 10% off.
[01:54:16.853 --> 01:54:21.816]  We've got huge discounts, 30% to 20% to 40% off on all the major nutraceuticals.
[01:54:22.236 --> 01:54:23.497]  Free shipping on some of the items.
[01:54:23.957 --> 01:54:25.838]  And we're building a new studio.
[01:54:25.878 --> 01:54:27.139]  I'm putting everything into it I've got.
[01:54:27.399 --> 01:54:28.420]  I don't want to lose.
[01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:31.241]  So it's not just about defeating the globalists, I'll be honest.
[01:54:31.301 --> 01:54:32.482]  It's not just about living in a free country.
[01:54:32.502 --> 01:54:33.202]  That's why I started it.
[01:54:33.523 --> 01:54:37.685]  Now it's so, it's always been personal, but now they're really trying to destroy me.
[01:54:37.745 --> 01:54:38.826]  We're in the crucible.
[01:54:39.146 --> 01:54:40.727]  Roger really got hit by polonium.
[01:54:41.187 --> 01:54:42.688]  Roger really got T-boned and hit.
[01:54:42.808 --> 01:54:44.108]  Roger really does get death threats.
[01:54:44.168 --> 01:54:44.729]  We really do.
[01:54:45.129 --> 01:54:46.229]  They have hit pieces out.
[01:54:46.249 --> 01:54:47.870]  They have armies of lying reporters.
[01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:52.152]  They have just every dirty trick they can, but they're so discredited it's not working.
[01:54:52.492 --> 01:54:53.353]  They don't want to kill us.
[01:54:53.613 --> 01:54:54.774]  At least they've already tried on Roger.
[01:54:55.614 --> 01:54:56.815]  But then they're going to make us martyrs.
[01:54:56.855 --> 01:54:58.075]  But see, they were going to have hearings.
[01:54:58.175 --> 01:54:58.755]  They said they were.
[01:54:58.795 --> 01:54:59.436]  He was being called.
[01:54:59.716 --> 01:55:03.738]  But then they had to kill him so he couldn't be there, so they could pin the whole Russian narrative on them.
[01:55:04.824 --> 01:55:05.564]  This is real.
[01:55:06.344 --> 01:55:07.324]  This is hardcore.
[01:55:07.805 --> 01:55:09.345]  That's why they're attacking us everywhere.
[01:55:09.665 --> 01:55:12.805]  CNN has an article out today saying, I'm gaining steam, I'm dangerous.
[01:55:13.206 --> 01:55:15.306]  Because folks, we really do reach 45 million people a week.
[01:55:16.026 --> 01:55:16.646]  They're scared.
[01:55:16.706 --> 01:55:17.526]  Some weeks even more.
[01:55:18.186 --> 01:55:21.107]  So, Roger, let's get into some of the news and the breaking information.
[01:55:21.367 --> 01:55:23.187]  But listen, InfoWars is yours, audience.
[01:55:23.247 --> 01:55:24.168]  You built it, you did it.
[01:55:24.268 --> 01:55:24.848]  I salute you.
[01:55:25.108 --> 01:55:27.088]  This is your weapon against the globalists.
[01:55:27.428 --> 01:55:28.408]  So, pray for us.
[01:55:28.668 --> 01:55:29.869]  Spread the articles, the videos.
[01:55:29.949 --> 01:55:31.089]  Get around their bots.
[01:55:32.469 --> 01:55:35.870]  You know, 20 times or less, do they let him spread his tweets on Twitter?
[01:55:36.090 --> 01:55:38.171]  They block him on Facebook, spread Roger's info?
[01:55:38.651 --> 01:55:39.792]  Do your own information!
[01:55:40.472 --> 01:55:44.313]  You know, take my videos, name them something else, like peaches and cream, to get around their bots.
[01:55:44.693 --> 01:55:45.573]  Just fight them!
[01:55:46.174 --> 01:55:49.195]  Roger Stone, let's get into some of these other big developments.
[01:55:49.235 --> 01:55:50.215]  What's going on with Trump?
[01:55:51.383 --> 01:56:00.808]  With him going after Assange, or his minions, you know, the CIA director saying, you know, it's a foreign intelligence op, we want to arrest him, when Trump's like, give me more Assange, good job.
[01:56:01.628 --> 01:56:17.337]  I don't want to, I mean, I like some of the stuff Trump's doing, I know he's a good guy, but the spending bill's too big, the Obamacare bill wasn't good enough, a lot of good stuff he's doing too, but at the same time, I understand he's having to compromise some, but, you know, my goodness, what's going on with the big guy?
[01:56:18.254 --> 01:56:20.114]  Well, I mean, I think we have to be very candid.
[01:56:20.154 --> 01:56:21.275]  The fight continues.
[01:56:21.435 --> 01:56:28.836]  When the two-party duopoly, when the political establishment could not defeat Donald Trump, now they seek to co-opt him.
[01:56:29.396 --> 01:56:33.597]  First, they tried to discredit him and to destabilize him.
[01:56:34.017 --> 01:56:34.777]  You remember that?
[01:56:34.897 --> 01:56:41.718]  There was the Electoral College argument, the recount argument, the Russian collusion argument.
[01:56:41.838 --> 01:56:44.498]  All of those, of course, have fallen away.
[01:56:44.578 --> 01:56:47.339]  So now they seek to co-opt him.
[01:56:48.099 --> 01:57:02.704]  I can confirm, as I said the other day, and I broke this news right here, I now believe the resignation of the Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy will come in the first week of June, as predicted first here on InfoWars.
[01:57:03.444 --> 01:57:15.688]  I can tell you that Senator Charles Grassley really got the hammerlock on the President to appoint Judge Stephen Colleton from the 8th Circuit as the Supreme Court Justice.
[01:57:16.448 --> 01:57:19.912]  Alex, just say he is not who you and I would select.
[01:57:20.613 --> 01:57:31.706]  We know that Judge Neil Hartigan of Western Pennsylvania, of the Pennsylvania, I should say the Pittsburgh District, remains a strong candidate.
[01:57:31.887 --> 01:57:32.707]  But I'm telling you,
[01:57:34.237 --> 01:57:42.064]  The dark horse, the president's real personal choice, in my opinion, remains Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[01:57:42.564 --> 01:57:47.168]  Mark my words, this will all unfold exactly as I have laid it out.
[01:57:48.209 --> 01:57:58.018]  I also learned today, working very closely with a very experienced New York City real estate attorney, that there is no doubt whatsoever
[01:57:58.803 --> 01:58:12.762]  That the refinancing of 666 Fifth Avenue, a building owned by the Kushner family, was partially refinanced by George Soros and his interests.
[01:58:13.343 --> 01:58:16.046]  That has now been confirmed as a fact.
[01:58:16.767 --> 01:58:25.130]  Did Soros state that perhaps by investing with the Kushner family that he was buying influence in the Trump administration?
[01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:39.634]  If the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees want to look into something nefarious, something suspicious, something that may be compromising for the Trump administration, then they should be looking into the activities of Mr. Soros.
[01:58:41.566 --> 01:58:46.932]  The other thing I would want to touch on here, Alex, is the deconstruction of Fox.
[01:58:47.693 --> 01:58:50.575]  This is not going to stop anytime soon.
[01:58:51.616 --> 01:59:02.948]  First we saw Bill O'Reilly go, then Bill Shine, believe me, Sean Hannity, my friend Judge Napolitano, Judge Jeanine Pirro, a great
[01:59:03.308 --> 01:59:10.416]  Patriot, a great prosecutor, the guy who, the person who should be the FBI director in this administration.
[01:59:10.976 --> 01:59:18.565]  I fear that those voices for freedom, those voices of liberty, are not going to be long for the Fox airwaves.
[01:59:19.105 --> 01:59:23.806]  I don't have to tell you, Alex, they are merely pushing viewers to Info Wars.
[01:59:23.887 --> 01:59:35.690]  They are merely making us stronger as Rupert Murdoch and his sons seek to transform Fox into something that resembles the Sky Channel in Britain.
[01:59:38.391 --> 01:59:41.292]  Expanding on this, we know there's been a war.
[01:59:41.312 --> 01:59:43.753]  I'm not saying the Ailes is perfect.
[01:59:44.173 --> 01:59:47.714]  Bill O'Reilly said horrible lies about me and just, you know, really, he's a bully.
[01:59:48.988 --> 01:59:58.241]  But Megyn Kelly destroyed her career, scuttled off, scampered off to NBC, and the Murdochs really only care about
[02:00:00.808 --> 02:00:03.911]  All their other properties, I guess, and hanging out with all the socialites.
[02:00:03.971 --> 02:00:07.474]  But for me, this isn't about money.
[02:00:07.554 --> 02:00:09.196]  For me, this is about audiology.
[02:00:09.216 --> 02:00:10.957]  And I'm not in competition with Fox.
[02:00:11.037 --> 02:00:12.559]  And I turned down a couple shows with Fox.
[02:00:12.919 --> 02:00:16.303]  I'm not going to fly to New York every week to take some weekend show and then be controlled.
[02:00:17.143 --> 02:00:22.449]  And I just see Fox killing itself when it actually had some good messages previously.
[02:00:23.289 --> 02:00:24.491]  Where do you think Fox is going?
[02:00:25.404 --> 02:00:40.263]  Well, it's obviously not about profitability because Roger Ailes, who is a good friend and I think a good man, who has been maligned by Gretchen Carlson and maligned by Megyn Kelly, I don't believe he sexually harassed either one of those women.
[02:00:40.723 --> 02:00:42.844]  And their stories have changed over time.
[02:00:43.924 --> 02:00:47.225]  So I think that this was a political assassination.
[02:00:47.665 --> 02:00:48.766]  It was a coup.
[02:00:49.766 --> 02:00:53.987]  I think anybody who knows Roger Ailes knows he's a right-thinking, patriotic American.
[02:00:54.348 --> 02:00:57.969]  He was not going to sit back and let Hillary Clinton steal the presidency.
[02:00:58.409 --> 02:01:00.090]  So they had to decapitate him.
[02:01:00.130 --> 02:01:00.950]  Now, like you,
[02:01:01.630 --> 02:01:06.935]  I'm not particularly a fan of Bill O'Reilly, his book on the Kennedy assassination.
[02:01:07.155 --> 02:01:10.859]  Well, hell, he not only didn't write it, he's never read it.
[02:01:12.060 --> 02:01:16.204]  And I've got my own beef with Sean Hannity and Bill Shine, for that matter.
[02:01:16.745 --> 02:01:22.730]  I believe that I was blocked from the airways by those two gentlemen because of my beef with Mark Levin.
[02:01:23.331 --> 02:01:25.732]  A guy who really has a face for radio.
[02:01:26.432 --> 02:01:34.175]  But putting that aside, Fox is no longer going to be available to us as a conservative alternative to the mainstream media.
[02:01:34.796 --> 02:01:45.200]  And all they are doing is making Infowars and Stone Cold Truths and so many other alternative media outlets stronger and more viable.
[02:01:46.178 --> 02:01:48.640]  How do we keep President Trump honest?
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:02:05.910]  I mean, look, we'd be idiots if we didn't say, thank God we got Gorsuch, thank God that they didn't get the Supreme Court, thank the good Lord above that we've got $300 billion in new jobs coming in and $3 trillion-plus in the stock market and China's respecting us again and we're getting some better deals there and all these new companies are coming back, on and on and on and on and on.
[02:02:05.930 --> 02:02:08.111]  I mean, the first 70 days were almost perfect.
[02:02:08.191 --> 02:02:09.472]  I was just like floating on a cloud.
[02:02:09.872 --> 02:02:13.234]  Then 70 days in, I thought, oh, is that just a shill that Bannon's out?
[02:02:14.835 --> 02:02:15.856]  The course changes.
[02:02:15.936 --> 02:02:17.397]  Now who is advising the President?
[02:02:17.417 --> 02:02:21.859]  I know he hears a bunch of people and then he makes the decisions, but clearly course changed.
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:24.201]  Is that because the whole government was just blocking him?
[02:02:24.241 --> 02:02:24.821]  Both parties?
[02:02:25.061 --> 02:02:26.062]  He couldn't get people in?
[02:02:26.462 --> 02:02:27.703]  There was a government revolt?
[02:02:27.763 --> 02:02:28.923]  We know the deep state did that.
[02:02:28.943 --> 02:02:29.564]  That's admitted.
[02:02:30.204 --> 02:02:31.545]  And then now he's having to compromise?
[02:02:31.565 --> 02:02:32.285]  Is that what's happening?
[02:02:32.305 --> 02:02:36.668]  Because I still see a lot of good he's doing, but you can see now that it's not a purist movement.
[02:02:37.566 --> 02:02:39.946]  I think he's being willfully misled, Alex.
[02:02:40.006 --> 02:02:40.747]  Here's what I know.
[02:02:41.067 --> 02:02:43.227]  I've known Donald Trump for almost 40 years.
[02:02:44.147 --> 02:02:49.048]  And when he has all the information, he almost invariably makes the right decision.
[02:02:49.688 --> 02:03:02.551]  It is only when he does not have all the information or the information that he's been given has been colored or altered or manipulated to give him a false impression that mistakes are made.
[02:03:03.251 --> 02:03:13.533]  We know for a fact that every single one of his advisors urged him to send 150,000 ground troops boots on the ground in Syria.
[02:03:14.134 --> 02:03:17.354]  And fortunately, there was one man in the White House who didn't like that idea.
[02:03:17.794 --> 02:03:20.575]  One man who said, no, that's a terrible public policy.
[02:03:20.935 --> 02:03:22.035]  No, we're not doing that.
[02:03:22.656 --> 02:03:24.176]  That man was Donald J. Trump.
[02:03:24.696 --> 02:03:28.317]  So my confidence continues to be with the president.
[02:03:28.877 --> 02:03:32.258]  And my opposition is to those who mislead him.
[02:03:32.978 --> 02:03:39.061]  I picked up today's New York Times today to read about Ivanka Trump's agenda for the next four years.
[02:03:40.061 --> 02:03:41.282]  Ivanka had an agenda?
[02:03:42.222 --> 02:03:42.723]  Who knew?
[02:03:43.643 --> 02:03:44.643]  I saw her at the convention.
[02:03:44.683 --> 02:03:45.864]  I thought she was terrific.
[02:03:46.404 --> 02:03:46.964]  I like her.
[02:03:47.305 --> 02:03:48.465]  I think she is terrific.
[02:03:48.805 --> 02:03:51.607]  But now suddenly she's unveiling an agenda?
[02:03:52.527 --> 02:03:54.548]  Who voted for Ivanka Trump?
[02:03:55.268 --> 02:03:57.729]  Who voted for Jared Kushner?
[02:03:58.430 --> 02:04:00.951]  Who voted for any of these globalists?
[02:04:02.148 --> 02:04:11.379]  And then we have news today that Richard Grenell, who no one, I think, fought harder and more effectively for Donald Trump.
[02:04:11.459 --> 02:04:19.830]  Grenell, a former diplomat under the Bush administration, but a guy who's come full circle, who understands the danger of the globalists.
[02:04:20.290 --> 02:04:23.192]  Who has renounced the new world order.
[02:04:24.053 --> 02:04:25.194]  He's openly gay.
[02:04:25.214 --> 02:04:29.838]  He was one of the most effective surrogates for Donald Trump.
[02:04:30.398 --> 02:04:34.621]  It was announced that he was the president's choice to be NATO ambassador.
[02:04:34.982 --> 02:04:38.545]  It would have been a superb nomination.
[02:04:39.025 --> 02:04:44.469]  We learned today that that appointment has been nixed by Rex Tillerson.
[02:04:45.635 --> 02:04:55.003]  And I am told that it is because he objects to the fact that Grinnell, despite the fact that he is learned and distinguished in experience, is openly gay.
[02:04:55.744 --> 02:04:57.585]  Now, that's not what I voted for.
[02:04:58.266 --> 02:04:58.806]  Not me.
[02:04:59.687 --> 02:05:00.608]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:05:00.688 --> 02:05:02.649]  I don't care about your sexual orientation.
[02:05:03.170 --> 02:05:07.073]  I care about your philosophy and your experience and your qualifications.
[02:05:07.473 --> 02:05:09.435]  This is very disappointing.
[02:05:10.056 --> 02:05:13.559]  And making it even worse, Alex, is the people surrounding
[02:05:14.617 --> 02:05:15.858]  Secretary Tillerson.
[02:05:16.439 --> 02:05:17.539]  They're never Trumpers.
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:22.684]  The people tell him that he can't hire Grinnell, a Trump loyalist.
[02:05:23.364 --> 02:05:24.965]  They're never Trumpers.
[02:05:25.586 --> 02:05:39.237]  This is a real blow to those who understand loyalty, to those who understand the quality and the character of Rick Grinnell, a man who has earned this job, in my opinion.
[02:05:39.717 --> 02:05:44.580]  All right, Roger, I want to thank you for the time tonight, and I just want to thank you for your friendship and all you've done.
[02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:47.222]  This isn't that important a story.
[02:05:47.322 --> 02:05:52.345]  I'm shocked a guy spent, I think, like two months here, three months, putting this together.
[02:05:53.585 --> 02:05:55.306]  Alex Jones will never stop being Alex Jones.
[02:05:55.346 --> 02:06:02.250]  I guess this is to be from BuzzFeed, who I know you mentioned is one of the worst things out there, getting sued for all their disinfo for Pissgate and the rest of it.
[02:06:05.407 --> 02:06:11.171]  I was reading, just scanning some of this during the break earlier, and I remember election night, because everything in here is lies.
[02:06:11.331 --> 02:06:21.799]  I mean, I can't believe, and I can't believe they're saying someone was here on election night, I really want to know who they are, and said that I was depressed Donald Trump won.
[02:06:22.759 --> 02:06:26.322]  We said everything that night, drinking champagne in here, that we believed.
[02:06:26.342 --> 02:06:28.944]  I had been up for 24 hours.
[02:06:30.922 --> 02:06:31.262]  I don't know.
[02:06:45.239 --> 02:06:50.683]  May change, but I said to you, I'm really upset because they're really going to fight us now.
[02:06:50.743 --> 02:06:54.226]  It's like Savage had said a week before, you know, we win this election, the war really begins.
[02:06:54.386 --> 02:06:55.907]  I knew they were coming after me then.
[02:06:56.067 --> 02:06:59.049]  I knew that, wow, we even had bigger responsibilities.
[02:06:59.109 --> 02:07:00.651]  I mean, the next day you said celebrate.
[02:07:01.471 --> 02:07:21.091]  Alex and I said celebrate when that Mexican food or whatever I said I am celebrating but man this is gonna be hard now this is I mean I was excited about it I was I knew they were gonna attack me even more and we were gonna get even bigger we had those discussions and I read this and it it it says
[02:07:22.830 --> 02:07:23.771]  He's the Goebbels of 2016.
[02:07:40.774 --> 02:07:45.981]  On November 9th, mainstream media woke up to the contours of an honest-to-God information war.
[02:07:46.061 --> 02:07:47.583]  Alex Jones named his company after 98.
[02:07:47.623 --> 02:07:49.745]  No, it was 97 I registered that name.
[02:07:50.166 --> 02:07:51.828]  He is, I moved the registry to the later though.
[02:07:52.068 --> 02:07:55.673]  He's the architect of our current political moment, and yet he looks miserable.
[02:07:57.253 --> 02:08:00.615]  And it goes on to basically say that, oh, we won't be BIC now.
[02:08:00.975 --> 02:08:02.256]  We need Democrats to bash.
[02:08:02.436 --> 02:08:02.657]  What?
[02:08:02.877 --> 02:08:05.979]  I fought with everything I had against Hillary.
[02:08:06.439 --> 02:08:09.681]  I paid people a hundred and plus thousand dollars just as a bonus.
[02:08:09.701 --> 02:08:10.702]  A thousand dollars a piece.
[02:08:10.762 --> 02:08:11.262]  Five thousand.
[02:08:11.302 --> 02:08:13.724]  I got it all over TV to go say Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[02:08:14.424 --> 02:08:18.627]  I financed women to fly up and be on the debates and all sorts of crap.
[02:08:18.667 --> 02:08:21.348]  I put airplanes up saying Hillary for prison.
[02:08:22.609 --> 02:08:27.372]  I got death threats, attacked, boycotted, hell on earth, the media coming after me.
[02:08:27.652 --> 02:08:36.638]  And then they sit here and write an article saying that I didn't want Donald J. Trump to be elected because I looked miserable at 3 a.m.
[02:08:37.078 --> 02:08:37.559]  in the morning.
[02:08:37.859 --> 02:08:39.560]  You were here, you were here the next day.
[02:08:42.037 --> 02:08:42.638]  This is crazy.
[02:08:42.738 --> 02:08:43.738]  I talked to the president.
[02:08:43.878 --> 02:08:44.398]  Go ahead.
[02:08:45.199 --> 02:08:46.419]  We were punch drunk.
[02:08:46.839 --> 02:08:47.920]  We were so happy.
[02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:49.140]  We were a bullion.
[02:08:49.460 --> 02:08:51.781]  Yes, you pointed out that the fight wasn't over.
[02:08:52.242 --> 02:08:54.162]  The president said that in his own remarks.
[02:08:54.223 --> 02:08:58.824]  Remember when he said, even though this election is over, the fight has just begun.
[02:08:58.844 --> 02:09:02.246]  But to say that you were depressed or morose
[02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:03.428]  Or negative?
[02:09:03.769 --> 02:09:04.389]  Or angry?
[02:09:04.829 --> 02:09:07.071]  Well, that's just a flat-out lie!
[02:09:07.131 --> 02:09:11.514]  That's a blatant, mainstream-media, BuzzFeed lie!
[02:09:11.894 --> 02:09:12.494]  I was there!
[02:09:12.834 --> 02:09:15.096]  I was with you for God knows what?
[02:09:15.116 --> 02:09:16.537]  8, 9, 10 hours straight?
[02:09:17.137 --> 02:09:18.578]  We were celebrating!
[02:09:19.118 --> 02:09:23.661]  We were enjoying every second of the discomfort of the Clintonites!
[02:09:23.741 --> 02:09:24.342]  Exactly!
[02:09:24.462 --> 02:09:27.704]  And then I was totally... And then after you left, I still went to the video until 4.
[02:09:27.884 --> 02:09:28.684]  It's the last one.
[02:09:28.724 --> 02:09:29.485]  Drudge linked to it.
[02:09:29.705 --> 02:09:30.506]  It's very powerful.
[02:09:31.246 --> 02:09:36.310]  What was it titled, like, uh, you know, My Life is Fulfilled or something?
[02:09:36.330 --> 02:09:38.292]  It was on Facebook mentions and on our streams.
[02:09:38.732 --> 02:09:39.372]  Duno's the name of it.
[02:09:39.392 --> 02:09:40.373]  I'm going to find that tonight.
[02:09:40.393 --> 02:09:49.180]  We're going to play that with Millie Weaver tonight, where I was just like in a rapture that even if Trump wasn't perfect, this show, Globalism, was on the rocks.
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:50.181]  Now they admit it is.
[02:09:50.501 --> 02:09:51.622]  This is such victory.
[02:09:51.682 --> 02:09:56.085]  And then they steal the essence of what we are and say, we're not real.
[02:09:56.746 --> 02:09:57.386]  We're fake.
[02:09:57.566 --> 02:09:58.968]  And we wanted Hillary to win.
[02:09:59.957 --> 02:10:02.563]  You think it's fun to have a murderer like Hillary calling you the Dark Heart?
[02:10:03.712 --> 02:10:05.613]  You think it's fun to have all that?
[02:10:05.653 --> 02:10:10.236]  These people are the literal scum of the earth when it comes to their lies.
[02:10:10.296 --> 02:10:12.517]  They just invert reality, Roger.
[02:10:13.258 --> 02:10:14.919]  It is the most sophisticated crap.
[02:10:15.079 --> 02:10:15.439]  Go ahead.
[02:10:16.119 --> 02:10:26.606]  Yeah, no, there's nothing better than waking up in the morning and seeing two freshman congressmen kicking your testicles around on national television like a football and calling you a traitor.
[02:10:27.446 --> 02:10:31.989]  I got into politics because of the anti-communism of Barry Goldwater.
[02:10:32.634 --> 02:10:35.515]  I stayed in politics because... You live in Cuba.
[02:10:35.535 --> 02:10:38.337]  You're married to a Cuban lady whose family was locked up by Castro.
[02:10:38.357 --> 02:10:39.417]  You battled Castro.
[02:10:39.737 --> 02:10:40.318]  I know.
[02:10:40.398 --> 02:10:42.019]  My family fought communists.
[02:10:42.519 --> 02:10:46.060]  I mean, I can't even get into it because a lot of it's, you know, obviously off record.
[02:10:46.341 --> 02:10:47.881]  I am so... And then they had hearings.
[02:10:48.141 --> 02:10:49.602]  I said, Roger, quit getting so mad.
[02:10:49.782 --> 02:10:54.444]  Then they finally had hearings where they said, I'm being criminally investigated for actually being a Russian spy.
[02:10:54.685 --> 02:10:56.025]  I don't get visited by the FBI.
[02:10:56.045 --> 02:10:57.446]  I don't get to go to Congress and testify.
[02:10:57.666 --> 02:10:59.547]  I just get called that and I got really mad too.
[02:10:59.747 --> 02:11:00.847]  Then they said, oh, arrest Alex.
[02:11:00.867 --> 02:11:01.388]  He got mad.
[02:11:03.089 --> 02:11:04.911]  It's unbelievable, Roger!
[02:11:04.931 --> 02:11:22.309]  No, I was on a debate last night on WIOND on the 100 Days opposite this very articulate Democrat and he talked about how the Russians use bots to retweet and repost the InfoWars.com links.
[02:11:23.058 --> 02:11:23.638]  No, they don't.
[02:11:23.958 --> 02:11:24.798]  That's a lie.
[02:11:25.239 --> 02:11:33.541]  That is what Media Matters for America does with the crap and disinformation they put out, but no one's interested in that.
[02:11:34.121 --> 02:11:36.181]  So, look, the fight has just begun.
[02:11:36.401 --> 02:11:37.322]  I'm just warming up.
[02:11:37.902 --> 02:11:50.145]  I am going to testify for the Senate and the House, and I'm going to take the exact words of these worthy elected officials, and I'm going to prove where they have been
[02:11:51.109 --> 02:11:56.594]  Dishonest, where they have told half-truths, partial truths, non-truths.
[02:11:57.234 --> 02:12:02.419]  It's just the basic smear tactics of the left, and the facts don't matter.
[02:12:03.019 --> 02:12:04.260]  But I know you.
[02:12:04.761 --> 02:12:05.381]  You know me.
[02:12:05.862 --> 02:12:06.983]  I'm not rolling over.
[02:12:07.083 --> 02:12:07.563]  Absolutely.
[02:12:08.604 --> 02:12:09.185]  Not a chance.
[02:12:09.965 --> 02:12:12.947]  Yeah, I mean, it is just the craziest crap on earth.
[02:12:13.087 --> 02:12:13.427]  All right.
[02:12:13.868 --> 02:12:15.469]  Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com.
[02:12:15.509 --> 02:12:16.870]  It's up to the listeners and viewers.
[02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:21.593]  If they believe like we believe, if they want to see change like V says in Vendetta, then you're our champions.
[02:12:21.633 --> 02:12:22.313]  We're your champions.
[02:12:22.333 --> 02:12:23.034]  I love you all.
[02:12:23.654 --> 02:12:25.135]  Hopefully Millie takes some calls coming up.
[02:12:25.195 --> 02:12:25.916]  I took some calls today.
[02:12:25.956 --> 02:12:27.357]  I'm going to be right through live tomorrow.
[02:12:27.737 --> 02:12:29.198]  Roger Stone, thank you so much, my friend.
[02:12:29.818 --> 02:12:31.119]  Let me make this final point.
[02:12:31.239 --> 02:12:34.702]  Alex, one week into Caveman, I love this stuff.
[02:12:35.758 --> 02:12:37.480]  My energy is boundless.
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:39.562]  This is a great, great product.
[02:12:39.642 --> 02:12:44.806]  So, if you want to help the movement, you want to keep InfoWire strong and vibrant and robust,
[02:12:45.558 --> 02:12:49.660]  Go to TheInfoWarsStore.com and grab this caveman formula.
[02:12:49.740 --> 02:12:52.482]  This is one of the best products you've ever turned out.
[02:12:52.702 --> 02:12:53.423]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:12:53.623 --> 02:12:54.023]  Thank you.
[02:12:54.103 --> 02:12:57.105]  Yeah, I mean, I just researched it, and I talked to all the sports folks.
[02:12:57.145 --> 02:12:57.345]  I know.
[02:12:57.385 --> 02:12:57.885]  Thank you, Roger.
[02:12:57.905 --> 02:13:00.727]  I know Roger's been a bodybuilder, marathon guy, you name it.
[02:13:01.027 --> 02:13:01.527]  Pretty tough guy.
[02:13:01.547 --> 02:13:02.528]  He's in great shape for his age.
[02:13:02.548 --> 02:13:04.469]  A lot better shape than I am, and he's a lot older than me.
[02:13:04.529 --> 02:13:06.510]  But thank you so much, Roger.
[02:13:06.530 --> 02:13:07.171]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:13:07.191 --> 02:13:08.071]  StoneColdTruth.com.
[02:13:08.091 --> 02:13:09.272]  Get his book, TheInfoWarsStore.com.
[02:13:09.292 --> 02:13:12.213]  And then I'm going to go to this video, and then bring Millie in.
[02:13:14.284 --> 02:13:17.385]  I go and I say, what is the best-selling supplement products right now?
[02:13:18.405 --> 02:13:23.806]  And then I go to the manufacturers, because most of the companies don't manufacture it, and I say, what's really in that?
[02:13:24.326 --> 02:13:28.887]  And I sign an on-disclosure form and stuff, and they say, there's $2 a product in that, and they sell it for $50.
[02:13:29.687 --> 02:13:34.028]  And I say, I want to put $15 or $20 a product in it and sell it for $45.
[02:13:34.168 --> 02:13:35.809]  And they go, nobody does that.
[02:13:35.849 --> 02:13:37.349]  Everybody does six, seven times markup.
[02:13:38.635 --> 02:13:39.315]  I said, I'm going to do it.
[02:13:40.195 --> 02:13:42.476]  I'll take 100, 200 times markups.
[02:13:42.496 --> 02:13:43.476]  I've got to pay for this whole operation.
[02:13:43.876 --> 02:13:46.857]  I said, I want this to be the thing that blows everybody away.
[02:13:47.677 --> 02:13:52.698]  So it has the good, clean chicken bone broth, then it has the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the bee pollen.
[02:13:53.519 --> 02:13:54.439]  Roger looks great, by the way.
[02:13:54.459 --> 02:13:55.439]  He got poisoned a while back.
[02:13:55.519 --> 02:13:56.139]  He's a lot better now.
[02:13:57.419 --> 02:14:03.481]  It's got the goji berry powder, alfalfa herb powder, and a little bit of stevia and a little bit of cocoa for the flavoring.
[02:14:03.521 --> 02:14:04.061]  Chocolate goes real well.
[02:14:04.081 --> 02:14:05.401]  We have strawberry coming out soon, too.
[02:14:06.442 --> 02:14:07.762]  And it's amazing.
[02:14:08.609 --> 02:14:09.809]  I didn't know Roger would do that plug.
[02:14:09.849 --> 02:14:11.570]  We can't keep it in stock.
[02:14:12.110 --> 02:14:14.391]  But then, I've got to ramp up and order more of it.
[02:14:15.171 --> 02:14:16.051]  It's about to sell out.
[02:14:17.612 --> 02:14:20.553]  And people that are into bone broth, they go, this is better than anything we ever had.
[02:14:20.673 --> 02:14:21.133]  Yeah.
[02:14:22.293 --> 02:14:22.653]  Yeah.
[02:14:23.194 --> 02:14:23.994]  Our DNA force.
[02:14:25.034 --> 02:14:27.275]  The problem is, our stuff is California standard level.
[02:14:28.348 --> 02:14:32.132]  And it's so hard to have it, there's more lead in the air than there is in California standards.
[02:14:32.612 --> 02:14:38.919]  So we're always just testing, testing batches, and finally, that's why DNA Force will be sold out for two, three months, or other products.
[02:14:38.959 --> 02:14:48.889]  And I may just stop saying stuff's California-passed, because we would be able to finance everything if I wasn't sold out of our best products half the time, because, you know, Dr. Group and the other manufacturers are trying to do California standard.
[02:14:50.162 --> 02:14:57.786]  Because they packed it just where the lawyers and everybody and it's almost impossible to get by and we have, you know, big labs tested that we tested again and we follow the rules.
[02:14:57.806 --> 02:14:58.646]  We know we're a big target.
[02:14:58.886 --> 02:15:03.489]  But the big thing is we want to have the highest quality so you get it, you love it, you keep buying it, and it funds the operation.
[02:15:03.749 --> 02:15:04.749]  Symbiotic relationship.
[02:15:05.190 --> 02:15:12.093]  But so many con men and globalists, they'll have supermodels and national TV ads and put a dollar or two in their product, sell it for 20 bucks.
[02:15:13.614 --> 02:15:14.034]  Or more.
[02:15:14.394 --> 02:15:15.475]  Put 10 bucks in it, sell it for 100.
[02:15:18.444 --> 02:15:26.411]  Because they just somehow think, you know, giving somebody really the best and then not spending much on advertising, they just think people are too dumb.
[02:15:26.491 --> 02:15:27.412]  Well, no, that's not what's happening.
[02:15:27.432 --> 02:15:39.403]  It's why third-party sites all over, all the big supplement Nazis, and I don't mean literal, like Seinfeld, you know, the soup Nazi, all the connoisseurs love what we're doing, because I've gone out and hired the best top people to help us do this.
[02:15:39.423 --> 02:15:40.945]  But things like Knockout's my idea.
[02:15:41.445 --> 02:15:43.727]  I'm like, why would you put up melatonin for 19 bucks?
[02:15:47.375 --> 02:15:54.518]  When we can put the same dose of melatonin in, sell it for $19, have L-tryptophan, valerian root, all the stuff that goes together.
[02:15:54.538 --> 02:15:56.039]  I checked with the expert, yeah, that all works together.
[02:15:56.599 --> 02:15:57.779]  And then people say it's the best thing ever.
[02:15:58.260 --> 02:16:00.461]  My lawyer has to have sleep studies, he was on four drugs.
[02:16:01.061 --> 02:16:02.061]  He writes the state code.
[02:16:02.982 --> 02:16:05.303]  Those lawyers stay up all night and they get in the habit of it and they can't sleep.
[02:16:05.583 --> 02:16:06.483]  For years, it was killing him.
[02:16:07.103 --> 02:16:08.064]  Knockout changed it all.
[02:16:08.324 --> 02:16:11.865]  Not the UT sleep studies, not the four drugs, I ran a will out.
[02:16:11.885 --> 02:16:13.186]  He wanted me to tell the testimony.
[02:16:13.988 --> 02:16:18.454]  He's a famous guy, wrote the Texas Family Code, and he'll sit there and tell you.
[02:16:19.115 --> 02:16:24.262]  Racehorse Haynes, he was Racehorse Haynes' protégé, and one of the most famous criminal lawyers ever.
[02:16:24.282 --> 02:16:25.805]  He was a criminal lawyer until he got into family law.
[02:16:26.726 --> 02:16:28.849]  Brown and Wilhite, and the guy looks like 10 years younger.
[02:16:28.889 --> 02:16:30.391]  He's like, thank you, thank you for this.
[02:16:31.681 --> 02:16:33.441]  I'm going to give you a discount on your hours for this.
[02:16:33.481 --> 02:16:34.922]  He goes, I can't believe it.
[02:16:34.982 --> 02:16:38.863]  He goes, I've taken other stuff like melatonin and stuff and it didn't really do anything.
[02:16:38.903 --> 02:16:39.623]  Why is this so good?
[02:16:39.643 --> 02:16:40.943]  I go, well, it's natural melatonin.
[02:16:41.323 --> 02:16:42.103]  It's from herbs.
[02:16:42.283 --> 02:16:44.084]  It's natural valerian root.
[02:16:44.104 --> 02:16:45.184]  It's all of them together.
[02:16:45.204 --> 02:16:47.084]  It's called knockout.
[02:16:47.544 --> 02:16:48.645]  And he only takes one.
[02:16:48.665 --> 02:16:51.785]  You can build up a tolerance, you know, and check with your physician.
[02:16:51.845 --> 02:16:52.845]  But that's what we have.
[02:16:52.965 --> 02:16:53.606]  It's $15.96 right now.
[02:16:56.638 --> 02:16:59.359]  Everything's discounted at InfoWarsTore.com and that's how you donate.
[02:16:59.479 --> 02:17:00.940]  Or make a pure donation to us.
[02:17:00.980 --> 02:17:02.600]  You can know we're fighting for you.
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:10.023]  We're fighting hard in the face of the demonization, the attacks, and even if they end up destroying me or putting me in prison or killing me, you know, I think God will take care of my family.
[02:17:10.043 --> 02:17:10.663]  I hope God will.
[02:17:11.183 --> 02:17:11.724]  It doesn't matter.
[02:17:11.744 --> 02:17:17.546]  I hit the barbed wire, I get machine gunned politically, you climb over, we win, you know, get into the foxhole in place.
[02:17:18.286 --> 02:17:21.488]  All right, Millie Weaver's going to be coming up for at least an hour and a half.
[02:17:21.508 --> 02:17:22.928]  I don't want her to have more time at the next hour.
[02:17:22.948 --> 02:17:24.969]  That's a lot for her to host, but she'll do a great job.
[02:17:25.349 --> 02:17:26.550]  We've got a lot of other special reports.
[02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:28.171]  This is the report.
[02:17:28.791 --> 02:17:29.991]  But we can go to Millie for just a second.
[02:17:30.011 --> 02:17:40.196]  She's got the products there, because we're doing plugs, and I'm going to do this premiere of a breakdown of the Inconvenient Fraud Part 2, Al Gore's new BS Savior of the World video.
[02:17:40.636 --> 02:17:42.777]  But Millie Weaver, we are now how many hours?
[02:17:42.817 --> 02:17:43.478]  You started at 11 a.m.
[02:17:43.498 --> 02:17:43.778]  Central?
[02:17:44.238 --> 02:17:47.942]  So we're now 9, 10, 10 hours and 20 minutes into this.
[02:17:48.002 --> 02:17:50.164]  Thank you so much for all the great work you and Gavin do.
[02:17:51.505 --> 02:17:53.227]  What do you have coming up after this piece?
[02:17:55.570 --> 02:17:56.691]  Sorry, I don't have any audio from her.
[02:17:56.711 --> 02:17:59.854]  I know I kind of jumped to you guys when I saw her on the screen.
[02:17:59.874 --> 02:18:00.575]  I'm sorry, Millie, go ahead.
[02:18:01.624 --> 02:18:13.548]  Well Alex, I'm going to be joined here tonight with Kit Daniels, the amazing writer and cameraman, and we are going to be having some amazing guests joining us.
[02:18:13.928 --> 02:18:20.550]  We're going to be joined by Louis Buff Perry, who is a renowned codebreaker, diplomat, and lecturer.
[02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:22.391]  We have Brittany Pettibone,
[02:18:22.831 --> 02:18:23.332]  We're good to go.
[02:18:42.453 --> 02:18:51.578]  On the Treasury Secretary who's confirmed that InfoWars is reporting on Obamacare looting scheme is true.
[02:18:52.018 --> 02:19:08.786]  So we have that going on and then last we have George Peterson who's going to be joining us around 10.30 and he's going to talk about how these Antifa are trying to remove historic American monuments in the name of PC, political correctness.
[02:19:10.089 --> 02:19:12.291]  So, we're going to be here with Kit Daniels.
[02:19:12.331 --> 02:19:14.073]  So, what do you think about that, Kit Daniels?
[02:19:15.154 --> 02:19:22.181]  Yeah, I think the whole Antifa thing, what's really interesting to me is about the counter-movement of resistance against Antifa.
[02:19:23.162 --> 02:19:27.146]  You're starting to see more and more conservatives that are actually standing up their rights, resisting.
[02:19:27.166 --> 02:19:28.687]  They're not backing down.
[02:19:28.727 --> 02:19:31.470]  They're actually getting physical fistfights with them.
[02:19:32.411 --> 02:19:34.513]  And, like, two or three years ago, you never saw that.
[02:19:35.089 --> 02:19:43.541]  It's pretty disturbing and we've seen how a lot of these groups end up being funded by these psychopathic elite like George Soros.
[02:19:43.901 --> 02:19:49.469]  How we've seen them being bused to these protests and how it's all orchestrated.
[02:19:50.811 --> 02:19:52.191]  I'm 20 minutes over.
[02:19:52.211 --> 02:19:52.611]  I apologize.
[02:19:52.631 --> 02:19:55.552]  I'm going to play this video and get to it, because you have all these great guests lined up.
[02:19:55.612 --> 02:19:56.532]  Go late if you need to.
[02:19:56.853 --> 02:19:57.433]  I apologize.
[02:19:57.453 --> 02:19:58.513]  I want you to get to all those guests.
[02:19:58.733 --> 02:20:00.874]  We're going to air this 11-minute video, and then get right back to you.
[02:20:01.154 --> 02:20:05.095]  But thank you, Kit, as well, for the work you're doing and the listeners and viewers.
[02:20:05.555 --> 02:20:07.515]  That's all coming up tonight.
[02:20:07.775 --> 02:20:17.098]  And remember, George Soros' law firm, and he founded, is the one suing us with the owner of the Chobani yogurt people for us criticizing the Muslims being brought in and the fact that he's promoting that.
[02:20:19.839 --> 02:20:24.004]  I don't believe he wants to bring in criminals, but he is promoting refugees in general.
[02:20:24.024 --> 02:20:25.526]  I don't believe Chobani itself did it.
[02:20:26.086 --> 02:20:30.552]  So we've corrected the headline dealing with that, where Chobani Yogurt importing rapists.
[02:20:30.572 --> 02:20:32.113]  That's not Yogurt Company doing it.
[02:20:32.314 --> 02:20:35.998]  It's the guy that owns it promoting them coming from these unvetted countries.
[02:20:36.038 --> 02:20:36.378]  And the U.N.
[02:20:36.398 --> 02:20:37.860]  and the State Department really aren't vetting them.
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:40.922]  So it's a semantical game, and so that's what's going on.
[02:20:40.962 --> 02:20:42.523]  But I want to be corrective about that.
[02:20:42.943 --> 02:20:46.546]  But it is a fact that in the town, they've reported 500% increase in TB.
[02:20:46.966 --> 02:20:49.307]  All these folks need to be tested and taken care of.
[02:20:49.327 --> 02:20:53.050]  A lot of the illegals coming across have TB, and people say, oh, well, don't test them.
[02:20:53.090 --> 02:20:53.570]  It's racist.
[02:20:53.650 --> 02:20:56.012]  No, we should give them treatment if we're going to let them into the country.
[02:20:56.052 --> 02:20:56.392]  Certainly.
[02:20:56.592 --> 02:20:59.594]  So that's my correction on the whole Chobani yogurt situation.
[02:20:59.835 --> 02:21:03.197]  Now, here is the Al Gore piece that Rob Dew and I put together.
[02:21:03.277 --> 02:21:07.740]  I saw the trailer for the film last week, the new piece of propaganda by Al Gore.
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:12.642]  And then I went and read online a leaked synopsis of it.
[02:21:12.962 --> 02:21:15.303]  It's like the first film, A Load of Manure.
[02:21:15.363 --> 02:21:21.865]  So here it is, an exclusive, and we'll post it the next hour at InfoWars.com so you can share this video in the InfoWars.
[02:21:21.905 --> 02:21:25.287]  And then back to Millie Weaver and Kent Daniels and the raft of amazing guests.
[02:21:25.467 --> 02:21:27.027]  I want to thank you all listeners for your support.
[02:21:27.347 --> 02:21:29.368]  Please support the InfoWars now more than ever.
[02:21:29.648 --> 02:21:30.749]  We're in the fight of our lives.
[02:21:30.789 --> 02:21:31.309]  We're winning!
[02:21:31.829 --> 02:21:33.530]  But we're just winning by an inch or two.
[02:21:33.770 --> 02:21:36.952]  We need your support, your prayers, and we need you to spread the links and articles.
[02:21:36.992 --> 02:21:38.292]  Here is the special report.
[02:21:41.234 --> 02:21:54.201]  If you are resuming this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:21:56.846 --> 02:22:02.029]  Climate change is an absolute 100% total fact.
[02:22:02.169 --> 02:22:06.832]  The next generation would be justified in looking back at us and asking, what were you thinking?
[02:22:06.932 --> 02:22:08.713]  Couldn't you hear what the scientists were saying?
[02:22:08.753 --> 02:22:11.734]  Couldn't you hear what Mother Nature was screaming at you?
[02:22:12.014 --> 02:22:18.818]  But studies by scientists, astrophysicists, you name it, prove humans don't even affect 1% of it.
[02:22:19.298 --> 02:22:25.442]  And Al Gore and his global corporate carbon taxes are absolutely not the solution to save us.
[02:22:26.182 --> 02:22:36.052]  From Paramount Classics comes a film that has shocked audiences everywhere they've seen it.
[02:22:36.172 --> 02:22:39.955]  I am Al Gore.
[02:22:40.055 --> 02:22:42.458]  I used to be the next president of the United States of America.
[02:22:44.139 --> 02:22:48.280]  In 2006, Al Gore put out the film An Inconvenient Truth.
[02:22:49.001 --> 02:22:55.903]  Now in 2017, An Inconvenient Truth Part 2 is set to hit screens across the world.
[02:22:56.623 --> 02:23:02.625]  We are about to fully debunk his previous film and, of course, his current film.
[02:23:02.925 --> 02:23:08.307]  And we've also gotten a synopsis, a spoiler sneak peek, of what's in the film.
[02:23:08.367 --> 02:23:10.708]  And, of course, we have the trailer here for review.
[02:23:11.488 --> 02:23:29.307]  An Inconvenient Load of Manure Part 2 by Mr. Gore sets him up as the savior of the world and someone who is on a pedestal above the people who must be listened to like he is Jesus Christ or Moses speaking from the mountaintop.
[02:23:29.767 --> 02:23:44.213]  Throughout the new sequel, we are treated to fawning minions literally holding his hand and crying in joy that they have met the Christ-like figure, the archetypal savior of the world.
[02:23:44.713 --> 02:23:58.079]  The film begins as our guru, Al Gore, leads us through what's happening in the world and his attempts to save it, and how the evil antichrist, Donald Trump, has come to overheat the planet and kill us all.
[02:23:59.119 --> 02:24:02.580]  It's supposed to be 70 degrees today, it's freezing here!
[02:24:03.780 --> 02:24:07.140]  Speaking of global warming, where is- we need some global warming!
[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:09.241]  It's freezing!
[02:24:11.981 --> 02:24:19.002]  Gore tells us in that down-home Tennessee accent that this is our home, this is Earth, and we've hit the peak of human development.
[02:24:19.242 --> 02:24:22.903]  We're not gonna get on rocket ships and fly to Mars.
[02:24:23.563 --> 02:24:27.404]  Don't let anybody tell you that we're gonna get on rocket ships and live on Mars.
[02:24:28.669 --> 02:24:29.670]  This is our home.
[02:24:30.050 --> 02:24:32.413]  The film is decidedly anti-America.
[02:24:33.053 --> 02:24:42.402]  We're shown how the world has unanimously come together through the UN and Al Gore to save the planet from evil carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[02:24:42.682 --> 02:24:46.205]  But only the evil America and Donald Trump stands in the way.
[02:24:46.966 --> 02:24:57.074]  The truth is, India, China, Mexico, and over 150 other countries are exempt from the carbon taxes that Europe, Australia, and the United States are under.
[02:24:57.374 --> 02:25:00.136]  So of course they have dirty, burning coal.
[02:25:00.396 --> 02:25:02.498]  They have all these other systems with no regulations.
[02:25:02.998 --> 02:25:06.341]  Of course they want more regulations on us so they can shut us down.
[02:25:06.681 --> 02:25:08.523]  And that's what this is really all about.
[02:25:08.903 --> 02:25:16.169]  The carbon taxes were developed in the 1980s by then-Senator Al Gore and Ken Lay of Enron fame.
[02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:19.312]  A way to tax the carbon cycle on the planet.
[02:25:19.652 --> 02:25:23.115]  People know oxygen's good, they know sunlight's good, they know water's good.
[02:25:23.395 --> 02:25:29.420]  But the fourth part, carbon dioxide has a scary sounding name, like carbon monoxide.
[02:25:29.781 --> 02:25:32.203]  So this life-giving trace gas,
[02:25:32.703 --> 02:25:36.967]  That's at the lowest level it's ever been recorded on this planet, is demonized.
[02:25:37.288 --> 02:25:42.893]  And then if we pay carbon taxes to Al Gore's carbon trading company, we'll all be saved.
[02:25:43.694 --> 02:25:53.864]  And of course, just like Obamacare, all the major companies, like General Electric, are exempt from the regulations, shutting down their competitors.
[02:25:55.333 --> 02:26:04.856]  After the devil Donald Trump is introduced to us in the film, we then see Al Gore telling you that he made a prediction that lower Manhattan would be flooded by a hurricane.
[02:26:05.216 --> 02:26:15.399]  The most criticized scene in the movie An Inconvenient Truth was showing that the combination of sea level rise and storm surge would flood a 9-11 memorial site.
[02:26:15.619 --> 02:26:18.139]  And people said, what a terrible exaggeration.
[02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:23.081]  Hurricane Sandy slammed into New York City last night, flooding the World Trade Center site.
[02:26:24.124 --> 02:26:26.605]  That happens every decade or so on record.
[02:26:26.905 --> 02:26:39.589]  But he predicts specifically an area by the World Trade Center destruction where they put in a slurry wall and an area designed for the hurricanes that come in and routinely flood the area.
[02:26:40.029 --> 02:26:43.510]  So he manufactures this one prophecy that came true.
[02:26:44.090 --> 02:26:50.535]  But of course, his new film doesn't get into his big prediction in 2006 that didn't come true.
[02:26:51.135 --> 02:27:00.763]  And that was that both the northern and southern ice caps, Arctica and Antarctica, would be completely melted by 2013-2014.
[02:27:00.843 --> 02:27:13.473]  He would use satellite footage that's time-lapse, showing it shrinking in the spring and summer, but he'd cut there and not showing it get big in the fall and winter.
[02:27:14.013 --> 02:27:16.118]  That's what the ice caps do.
[02:27:16.740 --> 02:27:21.511]  The ice caps of Mars get bigger and smaller during its winter and its summers as well.
[02:27:22.807 --> 02:27:32.732]  Another big one in his previous film was the implication that polar bears couldn't swim when they were out hunting on ice flows, and that the ice was all disappearing and they wouldn't have a home.
[02:27:33.512 --> 02:27:49.120]  Al Gore knows full well that the glaciers shrink again in the summer, expand in the winter, and that polar bears are the best land animal swimmers in the world, measured swimming over 300 miles, hunting seal, walrus, and of course, whale.
[02:27:50.009 --> 02:27:54.111]  But again, he knows his young audience, mainly school children, don't know that.
[02:27:54.451 --> 02:27:56.771]  So it tugs at the strings of their hearts.
[02:27:57.192 --> 02:28:04.134]  He also doesn't tell them that polar bear populations are up five times what they were measured in the 1950s.
[02:28:04.794 --> 02:28:06.335]  But of course, that's another big lie.
[02:28:07.135 --> 02:28:11.637]  First, it was going to be the great ice age in the 70s and 80s that we needed carbon taxes for.
[02:28:12.397 --> 02:28:15.778]  Then it was going to be the great warming phase in the 90s and 2000s.
[02:28:15.798 --> 02:28:17.239]  But the last 16, 17 years conclusively,
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:21.882]  The decline in temperature has happened.
[02:28:22.462 --> 02:28:27.406]  That's why six years ago in Copenhagen at the UN summit, they had to quote, hide the decline.
[02:28:27.787 --> 02:28:29.788]  And all of that came out in Climategate.
[02:28:30.209 --> 02:28:38.115]  But Al Gore hopes you forget that and just believe he's the second coming of Christ and pay him billions, making him the carbon billionaire.
[02:28:38.575 --> 02:28:40.297]  It is right to save humanity.
[02:28:40.777 --> 02:28:43.219]  It is wrong to pollute this earth.
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:46.242]  It is right to give hope to the future generation.
[02:28:49.224 --> 02:28:56.192]  He talks about the despair of global destruction and the forest fires and all the rest of it, but says, don't worry, there's hope.
[02:28:56.733 --> 02:29:02.139]  Global governance and world carbon taxes paid to him and other select corporations.
[02:29:02.740 --> 02:29:04.001]  Let's look at those forest fires.
[02:29:04.742 --> 02:29:15.505]  It's admittedly Forest Service policy not letting farmers and ranchers cut fire breaks in the last 60 years that has caused huge megafires to continue to spread.
[02:29:15.966 --> 02:29:19.086]  There's always been wildfires, as long as there's been plants and lightning.
[02:29:19.347 --> 02:29:23.388]  And it's part of the carbon cycle and produces a lot of nitrogen and other things for the soil.
[02:29:24.048 --> 02:29:34.979]  But again, Al Gore points cameras at these forest fires and shows humans driving through them and implies that forest fires are something new on this planet.
[02:29:35.419 --> 02:29:40.304]  He says the great change we've seen is the solar farms and the big wind farms.
[02:29:40.625 --> 02:29:42.326]  But if you look at the statistics, it's clear.
[02:29:42.847 --> 02:29:47.271]  Solar produces far less energy than coal, oil, or natural gas.
[02:29:48.112 --> 02:29:59.701]  But it's still much better than wind, who produces the least amount of energy system out there and creates absolute devastation to wildlife in the areas where it's being implemented.
[02:29:59.982 --> 02:30:09.970]  But the reason Al Gore's for it is that he and his friends, through government contracts, are making hundreds of billions of dollars off the wind farms and off the solar farms.
[02:30:10.610 --> 02:30:12.211]  But there's something even more insidious here.
[02:30:13.035 --> 02:30:35.821]  They get to imply that they're cutting edge, that they are there promoting new technologies, when they're the ones blocking fish infusion, zero-point energy, carburetors where you can go 100 miles on a single gallon, and so many other systems of so-called disruptive technologies we know the globalists have been blocking the development and deployment of in the last 60 years.
[02:30:36.821 --> 02:30:46.288]  I saw on the news just a few days ago that Bill Nye's latest episode of his TV show was about how we shouldn't have more than one child, like China, and how we should be penalized if we do.
[02:30:46.708 --> 02:30:48.009]  And then I noticed the name of the show.
[02:30:48.329 --> 02:30:49.450]  I hadn't seen it on Netflix.
[02:30:49.910 --> 02:30:51.451]  Bill Nye Saves the World.
[02:30:52.432 --> 02:30:59.379]  When I saw that trailer for Al Gore's new film a few weeks ago, I was intending to shoot this review and call it, Al Gore Saves the World.
[02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:03.243]  But you actually look at the people pushing the modern environmental agenda.
[02:31:03.563 --> 02:31:14.974]  It's all about cutting off human resources, all about saying humans are cast as the bad guys, except for the elite who are busy reducing our population and enslaving us all for our own good.
[02:31:15.855 --> 02:31:21.620]  Al Gore and Bill Nye are a bunch of eugenicist globalists on record.
[02:31:22.181 --> 02:31:23.402]  This is not about the environment.
[02:31:23.602 --> 02:31:43.499]  It's about making carbon the evil, instead of genetic engineering, cross-human animal chimeras, open-air pollination of cross-species pharmacological crops, massive rise of new bacteria and mutated viruses that threaten not just human life, but human life on the face of this globe.
[02:31:44.079 --> 02:31:50.201]  This movement is in the tradition of every great movement that has advanced humankind.
[02:31:50.982 --> 02:32:00.325]  They want a system, a new dark age for the general public, where they use environmentalism and political correctness to shut down free thought and bring in a great psychological tyranny.
[02:32:00.765 --> 02:32:05.327]  We need to expose Al Gore's last film and his latest fraud for what it is.
[02:32:06.087 --> 02:32:17.397]  A piece of sophistic fraud meant to demonize humanity, make us hate ourselves, and turn off our life force so the parasite globalists can rule and control us into the future.
[02:32:33.294 --> 02:32:35.155]  I joke around a lot on the air.
[02:32:35.315 --> 02:32:36.235]  I try to have a good time.
[02:32:36.855 --> 02:32:38.036]  I'm a happy person overall.
[02:32:38.896 --> 02:32:46.458]  But I have intellectually studied the globalist program and I understand it is a major threat to myself and my family and your family as well.
[02:32:47.459 --> 02:32:52.200]  Now we do have some gallows humor around here, but when you get down to the bedrock of our message, it's dire.
[02:32:53.180 --> 02:32:56.041]  Globalism is an anti-human system.
[02:32:56.321 --> 02:32:57.682]  It's a breakaway civilization.
[02:32:58.752 --> 02:33:09.818]  The elites believe humanity's finished and are basically stealing our wealth, our intellectual property, and our very essence to construct their new world order system.
[02:33:10.918 --> 02:33:14.460]  Now, I never started in full wars 22 years ago believing I would save the world.
[02:33:14.740 --> 02:33:16.201]  I just wanted to be a watchman on the wall.
[02:33:17.406 --> 02:33:24.791]  A modern Paul Revere who could warn people about the threats, and I believe that humanity, when faced with a threat, would take action against it.
[02:33:25.432 --> 02:33:30.615]  So many times globalists would tell me that, oh Alex, they're a bunch of cowards, you're just scaring them for us.
[02:33:31.196 --> 02:33:40.803]  And I would always say, no, humanity, at least a large part of it, when faced with the truth, will do what it takes to defeat your unelected planetary dictatorship.
[02:33:41.423 --> 02:33:48.671]  Wednesday, May 3rd and Thursday, May 4th, we're doing a 30-hour transmission that kicked off at 11 a.m.
[02:33:49.092 --> 02:33:49.592]  on Wednesday.
[02:33:50.633 --> 02:33:55.299]  And we've got Congressman Ron Paul and so many other amazing patriots joining us.
[02:33:55.979 --> 02:34:01.425]  I hope that you'll do several things during this important transmission to defend free speech and defend what's left of the West.
[02:34:02.046 --> 02:34:13.473]  I hope you'll spread the link at Infowars.com forward slash show to new people who've never heard of the show, or who have heard of us being demonized in the national news, but have not actually heard the message.
[02:34:14.293 --> 02:34:16.474]  Tell people, this is the forbidden message.
[02:34:16.814 --> 02:34:18.475]  This is the show they don't want you to hear.
[02:34:18.756 --> 02:34:20.917]  This is the show the globalists are afraid of.
[02:34:21.317 --> 02:34:26.300]  That's why they're trying to assassinate my character, my crew's character, and the rest of our host character.
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:31.383]  Because they understand we're promoting freedom, open society, goodwill.
[02:34:32.369 --> 02:34:34.771]  The globalists are selling division and evil.
[02:34:35.171 --> 02:34:38.914]  So please spread the word about the live transmission so we can reach new people.
[02:34:38.954 --> 02:34:39.494]  That's the goal.
[02:34:39.635 --> 02:34:41.756]  Will this 30-hour broadcast save the world?
[02:34:41.836 --> 02:34:42.036]  No.
[02:34:42.477 --> 02:34:48.061]  But it is the spirit of defiance and the incremental march against tyranny that overall will save the world.
[02:34:48.561 --> 02:34:52.524]  My friends, we can come together as one human race that bleeds red blood.
[02:34:53.305 --> 02:34:53.465]  Okay.
[02:35:08.302 --> 02:35:11.164]  And also financially support us because that's what funds us.
[02:35:11.504 --> 02:35:21.890]  We don't have George Soros or the Ford Foundation or the federal government funding us like MSNBC and CNN or the Saudis and the Mexican kingpin Carlos Slim funding the New York Times.
[02:35:22.390 --> 02:35:36.979]  We have people like you buying Molon Labe t-shirts and high-quality non-GMO heirloom seed banks to plant summer and fall gardens and high-quality water filtration systems that are the very best out there at the lowest prices.
[02:35:37.419 --> 02:35:42.101]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products at infowarestore.com.
[02:35:42.401 --> 02:35:47.843]  We have a huge line of nutraceuticals, many of which are household names that we've private labeled at lower prices.
[02:35:47.863 --> 02:35:49.544]  A lot of stuff that Whole Foods carries.
[02:35:49.804 --> 02:35:56.046]  And many of which have developed with top producers, scientists, and researchers, like Knockout, our amazing sleep aid.
[02:35:56.446 --> 02:36:06.650]  And when you purchase these products, it funds what we're doing and really puts a stick in the eye of the globalists like George Soros and others that are doing everything they can right now to shut us down.
[02:36:07.130 --> 02:36:09.711]  The law firm George Soros funded is suing me right now.
[02:36:10.172 --> 02:36:13.153]  A member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York is suing me right now.
[02:36:13.533 --> 02:36:20.077]  The globalists are doing everything they can to silence us and to demonize me and to destroy my family, quite frankly.
[02:36:21.277 --> 02:36:26.160]  But they're following the arrogance of the elite that has brought them down throughout history.
[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:28.381]  Because the world sees the attacks.
[02:36:28.441 --> 02:36:29.262]  They see the lies.
[02:36:29.602 --> 02:36:30.682]  They see the demonization.
[02:36:31.483 --> 02:36:35.265]  And so we've never had more visitors, more traffic than InfoWars.com.
[02:36:36.926 --> 02:36:45.734]  The problem is the attacks are sustained, they're intensifying, and so even though we're growing, it's not quite fast enough to be able to defeat their attack profile.
[02:36:46.134 --> 02:36:57.103]  So that's why I'm asking you to double down so they see us really grow, not just stay the same, and understand that their attempts to shut us down will be met with total resolve and commitment.
[02:36:57.524 --> 02:37:02.688]  We have huge specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:37:40.172 --> 02:37:41.993]  Prostagard, incredible formula.
[02:37:42.474 --> 02:37:46.478]  Winter Sun, the knockout that I mentioned, and so many other great products.
[02:37:46.518 --> 02:37:48.099]  And then finally, let me see if it's still here.
[02:37:48.239 --> 02:37:48.499]  It is.
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:51.362]  This just came back in after two months being sold out.
[02:37:51.802 --> 02:37:55.025]  Super blue, high quality, organic toothpaste.
[02:37:55.786 --> 02:38:00.790]  Fluoride-free, with iodine, with colloidal silver, with tea tree oil and peppermint oil.
[02:38:01.131 --> 02:38:02.031]  It's concentrated.
[02:38:02.071 --> 02:38:04.914]  My dad is a quasi-retired dentist, oral surgeon.
[02:38:05.154 --> 02:38:08.337]  He helped develop this with one of the biggest manufacturers in the country.
[02:38:08.457 --> 02:38:09.157]  It's amazing.
[02:38:09.538 --> 02:38:13.181]  And again, when you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional 10% off.
[02:38:13.281 --> 02:38:13.901]  It's a win-win.

[02:38:32.875 --> 02:38:35.357]  Again, I want to defeat the globalists.
[02:38:35.437 --> 02:38:36.078]  I'm determined.
[02:38:36.178 --> 02:38:36.698]  I'm focused.
[02:38:37.238 --> 02:38:45.143]  But without you spreading the word, without you financially supporting us, and without you praying for us, we don't have a chance in hell.
[02:38:45.544 --> 02:38:47.325]  But if you get behind us like you've already done,
[02:38:48.985 --> 02:38:49.886]  Turn it up a notch?

[02:38:54.429 --> 02:38:56.731]  We want to have a shared destiny together.
[02:38:56.971 --> 02:38:58.152]  We want to go to the stars.
[02:38:58.553 --> 02:38:59.794]  Look how far we've already come.
[02:39:00.054 --> 02:39:01.775]  So let's tell the globalists we're not trash.
[02:39:02.076 --> 02:39:05.078]  Let's tell Bill Guy, the science guy, that we're going to have more than one child.
[02:39:05.358 --> 02:39:08.381]  Let's tell David Rockefeller that, you know, we're not subhumans.
[02:39:08.661 --> 02:39:12.884]  Let's tell Ted Turner, who could have five kids, but tells us we're subhuman, he can go to hell.
[02:39:13.185 --> 02:39:14.426]  And let's take action.
[02:39:14.946 --> 02:39:23.059]  There's nowhere you can spend your hard-earned money to get better products and then make sure that money goes to a good cause than InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:39:23.299 --> 02:39:24.621]  But regardless of what you do...

[02:39:42.003 --> 02:39:50.369]  Now back to the live transmission with the amazing host and guest and special reports during the 30-hour broadcast that we're now partway into.
[02:39:50.729 --> 02:39:53.211]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:39:53.491 --> 02:39:54.732]  Please spread that link.
[02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:04.663]  As we kick off hour number 10 at 9 p.m.
[02:40:04.703 --> 02:40:09.969]  Central, I introduce your host, Millie Weaver from the InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[02:40:17.216 --> 02:40:22.258]  You are watching the historic Freedom of Speech 30 hour broadcast with InfoWars.
[02:40:22.758 --> 02:40:31.622]  I am Millie Weaver joined by Kit Daniels and we are going to be talking about some of these elite psychopaths and what they're up to.
[02:40:31.642 --> 02:40:41.467]  I know we have people like George Soros who is attacking us and that's a part of the reason we're doing this broadcast is because we're always trying to be silenced by
[02:40:42.307 --> 02:40:44.529]  People who have globalist interests.
[02:40:44.989 --> 02:40:46.530]  What do you think about that, Kid Daniels?
[02:40:46.570 --> 02:40:48.892]  These globalists trying to silence InfoWars.
[02:40:49.232 --> 02:40:53.236]  Well, it's interesting to me how you got the globalists.
[02:40:53.256 --> 02:40:55.537]  They're extremely intellectual.
[02:40:55.557 --> 02:41:03.684]  I think you said before the show, they consistently test out at IQ 170 and above, yet they're completely immoral.
[02:41:04.528 --> 02:41:11.101]  And they lack, you know, any sort of basic understanding of human emotions as far as how to act like you and me act.
[02:41:11.121 --> 02:41:12.543]  You know, they have no moral compass.
[02:41:13.646 --> 02:41:14.166]  That's right.
[02:41:14.226 --> 02:41:38.138]  It's just like how this ex-banker who claims he was a Dutch banker and he claims to have been invited to a child sacrifice ritual and he was really high up in with these financial elitists who he said they were all kind of training to be psychopaths and you know psychopaths do typically have high IQs.
[02:41:38.498 --> 02:41:39.679]  They're usually very smart.
[02:41:39.719 --> 02:41:42.961]  They're hard to detect and that's exactly
[02:41:43.801 --> 02:41:45.244]  I like to think of it this way.
[02:41:45.264 --> 02:41:46.727]  I use automotive terms a lot.
[02:41:55.836 --> 02:41:58.278]  People that are really smart, they're kind of like a big block engine.
[02:41:58.398 --> 02:42:01.601]  You know, it's very powerful, it's got a lot of torque, but they overheat a lot.
[02:42:01.622 --> 02:42:03.363]  You know, they've got reliability issues.
[02:42:03.443 --> 02:42:07.127]  I think the same thing about highly intelligent people, myself included.
[02:42:07.707 --> 02:42:14.133]  You have a lot of people that are smart, but they have, for lack of a better term, mental issues or psychopaths.
[02:42:14.193 --> 02:42:18.477]  They tend to have more cases of depression with people that are smarter.
[02:42:19.349 --> 02:42:26.819]  You know, you have a lot of people that are more, if they're more self-aware of themselves, they tend to have more emotional issues.
[02:42:27.119 --> 02:42:29.382]  And I think a lot of that can be explained with a lot of this, right?
[02:42:29.563 --> 02:42:30.224]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:42:30.284 --> 02:42:32.567]  And they tend to dabble in the occult.
[02:42:33.288 --> 02:42:35.010]  And even in this interview where
[02:42:35.911 --> 02:42:43.234]  Ronald Bernard, who is a Dutch banker, he talks about how really and truly these people were Luciferians.
[02:42:43.554 --> 02:42:44.574]  They actually were.
[02:42:44.634 --> 02:42:48.835]  Whether you want to believe in religion or not, to them it's real and it's a real thing.
[02:42:48.916 --> 02:42:54.978]  So make sure you guys check out this amazing investigative report that myself and Gavin did.
[02:42:55.318 --> 02:42:57.458]  It's called Dark Side of the Occult.
[02:42:57.819 --> 02:43:03.140]  It really goes into why these elite psychos are sacrificing children.
[02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:04.261]  What's in it for them?
[02:43:04.961 --> 02:43:15.384]  But we are actually going to be joined over phone by Louis Buff Perry, who is a renowned Codebreaker diplomat and lecturer.
[02:43:16.004 --> 02:43:21.246]  And he has hobnobbed with some pretty, you know, elite people and he's going to kind of give us his take.
[02:43:21.306 --> 02:43:24.787]  So let's go ahead and see if we can talk to Louis Buff Perry.
[02:43:24.807 --> 02:43:26.787]  Hi Millie.
[02:43:27.768 --> 02:43:29.008]  Hi Buff, how's it going?
[02:43:29.758 --> 02:43:31.260]  Pretty good, pretty good.
[02:43:31.280 --> 02:43:33.963]  We're going through a hockey frenzy.
[02:43:34.564 --> 02:43:40.291]  Talk about pathology right now here in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
[02:43:40.311 --> 02:43:42.294]  So I had to close all the windows and the sliding.
[02:43:44.859 --> 02:43:46.160]  The crowd's outside here.
[02:43:47.081 --> 02:44:03.851]  Okay, so, well, Buff, I know you were telling me a little bit about some of the personal stories that you had in California, how you actually came across some of these weird parties that some of these people that have come forward as whistleblowers have talked about.
[02:44:03.911 --> 02:44:10.175]  Now, nothing as extreme as a child sacrifice ritual by any means, but did you want to kind of tell us a little bit about that?
[02:44:12.798 --> 02:44:16.962]  Well, I was brought to a party.
[02:44:17.022 --> 02:44:33.335]  I wasn't personally necessarily invited, but it was in my hometown of San Jose, California, in a home that is adjacent to, I think it's the largest cemetery in the city of San Jose.
[02:44:34.055 --> 02:44:40.821]  And there's no doubt in my mind that I witnessed some activities going on.
[02:44:41.721 --> 02:44:54.666]  I didn't witness any sexual activities directly, but activities going on between young males, very young males, and older males.
[02:44:55.187 --> 02:45:07.432]  And it was clear to me that the activities happening in the back rooms and so on, I didn't stay there long enough to really do a complete analysis of this.
[02:45:08.303 --> 02:45:10.364]  I was there long enough to get the drift.
[02:45:10.904 --> 02:45:15.987]  There was child abuse that was going on.
[02:45:17.567 --> 02:45:20.409]  I took some action.
[02:45:20.449 --> 02:45:23.410]  I won't get into details, but I did take some action.
[02:45:23.790 --> 02:45:29.313]  I would say I did witness a process.
[02:45:30.636 --> 02:45:44.022]  Uh, that does occur, uh, in, in many civilizations and cultures, but in this case, it, it, it, it isn't part of a norm or an institution that's, that's ancient.
[02:45:44.282 --> 02:45:55.087]  It, it was something that had to do with, you know, the, the kind of corruption and, and super fast social change going on that kind of allowed for
[02:45:56.212 --> 02:46:00.633]  You know, the public display of pedophilia.
[02:46:01.334 --> 02:46:16.419]  Well, you know, the Dutch banker Ronald Bernard, he said that it's all about blackmail and that this is the method that the elite use to obtain blackmail, even on, you know, influential people and even politicians.
[02:46:16.719 --> 02:46:19.720]  Have you heard any of that stuff, you know, to be true?
[02:46:21.141 --> 02:46:32.204]  Well, I think some of it's true when it involves the setting up of situations so that laws are broken.
[02:46:32.224 --> 02:46:36.346]  Because otherwise, you know, these accusations don't go anywhere.
[02:46:37.426 --> 02:46:44.368]  But if there's a law that's broken, it provides the template to develop the rest of the
[02:46:45.592 --> 02:46:54.034]  Yeah, I also see this as a, like a gang initiation in which, you know, it's basically like the global elite.
[02:46:54.634 --> 02:46:56.055]  You know, they're just like the mafia.
[02:46:56.175 --> 02:47:00.176]  It's like, but instead of having extortion rackets, they got aircraft carriers.
[02:47:00.336 --> 02:47:01.556]  That's the same thing you're seeing here.
[02:47:01.576 --> 02:47:14.379]  This is like a whole, let's get the, uh, let's get all the people into this local elite group and get them into the gang and, you know, get them initiated into the secret occult, which is basically the local government.
[02:47:15.188 --> 02:47:28.712]  Yeah, it's a perfect way to obtain blackmail and to create a tight bond of secrecy when you're engaging in pedophilia and these, you know, satanic or luciferian rituals.
[02:47:28.792 --> 02:47:35.154]  It gets people into this mindset that they can look the other way, you know, when you have a city manager that's doing something wrong.
[02:47:35.854 --> 02:47:42.819]  That the local county clerk is going to look the other way, because the county clerk did something at one of these parties that the city manager saw.
[02:47:42.839 --> 02:47:46.681]  So it creates this bond of secrecy that allows this to prosper.
[02:47:46.701 --> 02:47:47.862]  Now I have a question, Bob.
[02:47:47.882 --> 02:48:03.432]  I've got to say that, you know, in New England and in Britain, the boys' schools and prep schools all practice some degree or other of what you call these initiation rites.
[02:48:04.677 --> 02:48:06.799]  And so it isn't something new.
[02:48:06.959 --> 02:48:09.281]  I think there is something new.
[02:48:09.781 --> 02:48:14.585]  There's a new dimension going on and it's what we're actually speaking about.
[02:48:14.605 --> 02:48:21.511]  A controlled situation that does allow for blackmail and greater social control.
[02:48:21.531 --> 02:48:24.674]  So at this party that you were at, Buff.
[02:48:26.277 --> 02:48:26.897]  Pardon?
[02:48:27.198 --> 02:48:42.087]  At this party that you were at in California, were there, I mean, you don't necessarily have to go into names, but were there people that you would perceive as elite that were there engaging in these nefarious activities?
[02:48:42.888 --> 02:48:43.468]  Absolutely.
[02:48:43.528 --> 02:48:52.894]  This is a very famous cemetery that this home was associated with or attached to in terms of property.
[02:48:53.738 --> 02:49:09.590]  And the individuals living in that home had something to do with the maintenance and the, I don't mean mowing lawns, but the organizational logistics of, you know, San Jose's biggest cemetery.
[02:49:09.950 --> 02:49:10.391]  Wow.
[02:49:10.771 --> 02:49:17.616]  Yeah, no, there's no question that elites are into the kinky stuff and dangerous kinky stuff.
[02:49:17.636 --> 02:49:22.840]  They get so bored with, you know, endless amounts of pleasure that they become inured
[02:49:23.710 --> 02:49:30.220]  And seek out new forms of sensation and pleasure and that's really what we're talking about.
[02:49:31.391 --> 02:49:31.911]  Exactly.
[02:49:31.971 --> 02:49:33.412]  It's really creepy.
[02:49:33.532 --> 02:49:36.674]  Is it just a coincidence that it's located right next to a cemetery?
[02:49:36.714 --> 02:49:40.575]  And you know, you're kind of insinuating that it doesn't seem like it was a coincidence.
[02:49:41.116 --> 02:49:50.380]  And that just reminds me of actually, I used to work with this girl and she told me that she interned as a mortician briefly.
[02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:55.743]  And she actually talked about a story where she said that people used to drop off
[02:49:56.758 --> 02:49:57.518]  We're good to go.
[02:50:21.252 --> 02:50:21.693]  Caught up
[02:50:34.907 --> 02:50:40.252]  Certain ways that people do things that work efficiently, you see it happen over and over again.
[02:50:40.492 --> 02:50:50.921]  You know, they're really smart the way they do it, and that just kind of leads more back to that whole, you know, psychopath, high intelligence, and the scheming that goes on within these people.
[02:50:50.961 --> 02:50:58.367]  But, Buff, you know, I really wanted to go into this really interesting story that you've been telling me about with Kyler.
[02:50:59.108 --> 02:51:03.591]  Who has been being investigated for several missing girls.
[02:51:03.651 --> 02:51:04.832]  Can you tell us about that, Buff?
[02:51:06.052 --> 02:51:21.722]  Yeah, in fact, tomorrow is the 10th year anniversary of the most famous of the girls who have gone missing and whose remains have not been found.
[02:51:23.103 --> 02:51:26.265]  Another girl who he was last seen with
[02:51:27.294 --> 02:51:27.394]  Yes.
[02:51:45.222 --> 02:51:59.227]  You know, they decided, they meaning the ongoing investigators, to really, really get their heels dug in this time around and see what new information might be dredged up.
[02:52:00.948 --> 02:52:05.609]  What they're getting, I think, is going to be some really big surprises.
[02:52:05.689 --> 02:52:09.771]  They, acting on some leads, did find
[02:52:11.392 --> 02:52:37.967]  Two sets of remains of young women, one of whom... So just so that listeners can actually understand how this may in fact correlate, I know you were talking a little bit about how one of these girls that supposedly claims that Kyler tried to kill her had said that he said he was part of some elite travel club.
[02:52:39.346 --> 02:52:42.787]  Yep, I've got the... It almost sounds like the Thuggy Cult from India.
[02:52:43.647 --> 02:52:44.087]  What's that?
[02:52:44.547 --> 02:52:47.248]  The Thuggy Cult from India back in the 19th century.
[02:52:47.268 --> 02:52:49.469]  You know, they basically... The Thuggy Cult.
[02:52:49.489 --> 02:52:52.069]  Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what this sounds like.
[02:52:52.089 --> 02:53:02.492]  You know, you have a traveling band that would build up trust with people and then they'd take them off the side of the highway in India and, you know, when they were asleep, they'd kill them in their sleep.
[02:53:03.635 --> 02:53:08.998]  So yeah, it's... Well, that's where the word, you know, in English, thug, comes from, by the way.
[02:53:09.038 --> 02:53:09.679]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:53:10.199 --> 02:53:11.139]  Thuggy.
[02:53:12.780 --> 02:53:15.482]  Yeah, they're a very curious bunch.
[02:53:15.542 --> 02:53:20.645]  They remind me a little bit of the organizational network called the Hashashin, or the Assassins.
[02:53:20.665 --> 02:53:25.127]  Yeah, Assassins from Northern Iran, the Inglesmiths.
[02:53:25.168 --> 02:53:32.532]  In Northern Africa, in terms of the Ismaili Assassins, that were part of the Fatimid dynasty.
[02:53:33.271 --> 02:53:40.476]  Yeah, I'm thinking of the Assassin cult that was in Iran that got taken over by the Khans, but I guess I digress.
[02:53:41.436 --> 02:53:55.445]  Now, Buff, can you tell us a little bit about, you know, because we touched on that he might be part of some travel club, but can you kind of touch on his grandfather and some of the interesting evidence and things that are going on with him?
[02:53:56.920 --> 02:54:15.131]  Well, first of all, my quote on the travel club issue, my quote from the files and the documents that we as a profiling group all had copy sets of is, and the girl's name is Gibbon, Candace, and then her last name, said Kyler was part of a travel club.
[02:54:15.831 --> 02:54:22.855]  And then I have a line drawn out from that statement saying this is the girl that he tried to kill twice.
[02:54:26.087 --> 02:54:34.212]  And she went through three different interviews, as I was told, by another member of the profiling group.
[02:54:36.313 --> 02:54:48.861]  So the idea behind this is that if he was and has been up till recently, because he's in prison again, for torching
[02:54:52.740 --> 02:55:09.830]  One of the girls' vehicles, who has been found dead, he... Let's fast-track this and look at the bigger picture, because otherwise there's a whole lot of digressions to this story.
[02:55:09.890 --> 02:55:10.210]  Yes!
[02:55:11.271 --> 02:55:21.577]  We're talking really about several missing people, about a number of missing young women in particular, that are associated with Kyler.
[02:55:23.458 --> 02:55:42.735]  I got into this when I was flown down to Southern California by my nephews, and I was picked up at the airport, was driven to this mansion, and the woman who had just recently purchased this estate asked me if I was interested in
[02:55:44.204 --> 02:55:49.346]  Considering profiling, because I was introduced to her as a codebreaker.
[02:55:49.846 --> 02:55:58.710]  And I had already gone on record for breaking some significant, pretty well-known codes that hadn't been broken before.
[02:55:58.810 --> 02:56:01.331]  So I said, yeah, I'm always interested in this.
[02:56:01.451 --> 02:56:03.112]  And one thing led to another.
[02:56:03.232 --> 02:56:06.913]  And before I knew it, I was part of a profiling group.
[02:56:07.433 --> 02:56:13.716]  And that profiling group included Homeland Security, the FBI, two police departments,
[02:56:14.935 --> 02:56:19.696]  And a whole bunch of detectives, private, public, and otherwise.
[02:56:20.596 --> 02:56:29.318]  And people who had skills like mine in code decipherment and decoding.
[02:56:29.438 --> 02:56:36.720]  And then the partner I was working with at the time is a PhD neurologist and psychiatrist.
[02:56:36.820 --> 02:56:42.801]  So he came in fittingly because of Kyler's profile.
[02:56:43.823 --> 02:56:59.386]  And I ended up with copies of Kyler's artwork, his lyrics to one of the songs that he wrote and performed with his band that he formed, and copies of his paintings.
[02:56:59.706 --> 02:57:11.649]  And the primary painting that I have and have done a really thoroughgoing analysis of with experts is
[02:57:12.609 --> 02:57:20.616]  Incredibly revealing, once you're on the logical trail that he's laying out for you to follow.
[02:57:21.257 --> 02:57:34.888]  And he's actually confessing to more than one murder, but in particular, he's confessing to Kara's absence, if we can put it that way.
[02:57:34.908 --> 02:57:37.170]  She had written a handwritten
[02:57:40.982 --> 02:57:52.853]  Or composed a handwritten analysis and memory of things that had happened in the last five days from the time that she had written it.
[02:57:53.573 --> 02:58:03.122]  And in this, she talks about Kyler and his attempts to kill her.
[02:58:04.728 --> 02:58:28.958]  Uh, goes into all kinds of detail about other aspects of this, this, this young man, Kyler, um, who, if we were, if we want to step into the family context, uh, you know, he, he has a half brother who's just recently gotten a lot of, uh, media attention because of, of warrants for his arrest for other matters, not having to do directly with Kyler.
[02:58:29.618 --> 02:58:32.419]  But the day that they found the burned up car.
[02:58:33.547 --> 02:58:34.428]  I think so.
[02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:47.420]  Wow.
[02:58:48.381 --> 02:59:00.927]  And she had it outside of any concealment, so I guess she did that to not get arrested because, you know, if she had it concealed and didn't have a license for a concealed weapon, there may have been trouble there.
[02:59:00.987 --> 02:59:02.908]  I don't know all those details.
[02:59:03.948 --> 02:59:06.489]  But it's interesting that it was all on the same day.
[02:59:06.709 --> 02:59:14.712]  Weren't you saying how you have a reason to believe that this is not just your average murder mystery?
[02:59:15.193 --> 02:59:23.816]  That you believe that Kyler is in fact, you know, being used to procure women for some travel club.
[02:59:24.456 --> 02:59:33.520]  And can you tell us what little pieces of evidence that you've come across and how you've kind of formed that idea?
[02:59:35.549 --> 02:59:58.426]  Well, the statements that have been made by people who were associated with Kyler during interviews conducted by local police in Missouri, two different police departments, one is Kansas City, another one is in the Pacific area, just outside of Kansas City.
[02:59:59.716 --> 03:00:01.557]  Where all of this has happened.
[03:00:01.957 --> 03:00:08.341]  And so there are a number of statements that suggest that he was a procurer.
[03:00:08.561 --> 03:00:19.607]  Well, we know that he was a procurer of sorts because he ended up charged and convicted for procuring designer drugs.
[03:00:21.208 --> 03:00:23.069]  And very expensive designer drugs.
[03:00:23.950 --> 03:00:26.191]  Weren't those from a CIA agent?
[03:00:26.311 --> 03:00:27.692]  This was fairly recently.
[03:00:29.282 --> 03:00:29.683]  What's that?
[03:00:30.204 --> 03:00:33.468]  Weren't those drugs from an agent of some sort?
[03:00:33.668 --> 03:00:34.870]  Like a CIA agent?
[03:00:35.310 --> 03:00:37.053]  Yeah, that's how they busted him.
[03:00:37.433 --> 03:00:45.724]  So he, you know, he was, he was, uh, they were able to, the authorities were able to then charge him.
[03:00:45.744 --> 03:00:46.905]  When did they bust him in?
[03:00:47.557 --> 03:00:48.197]  Drug sales.
[03:00:48.277 --> 03:00:49.558]  What state?
[03:00:50.159 --> 03:00:50.539]  Missouri.
[03:00:50.959 --> 03:00:57.984]  Yeah, I mean, to me, that's amazing because you wouldn't think Missouri would be the state where you'd have these hardcore designer drugs, you know?
[03:00:58.284 --> 03:01:02.287]  Yeah, didn't it seem like he had special, like, pull and connections?
[03:01:02.327 --> 03:01:05.289]  Like, who was the lawyer that was representing him, Buff?
[03:01:08.651 --> 03:01:16.356]  It's a family of lawyers, and they're very, very well-known in the Democratic Party.
[03:01:17.809 --> 03:01:37.804]  And in historical phases in America, civil rights included, he for whatever reason ended up with this set of lawyers.
[03:01:41.036 --> 03:01:45.700]  That, I don't know what that means in terms of them being in the Democratic Party.
[03:01:45.760 --> 03:01:49.303]  I mean, obviously the Democratic Party is not instrumenting this.
[03:01:49.944 --> 03:01:50.324]  What's that?
[03:01:50.965 --> 03:01:58.251]  Here's one thing I'm noticing throughout this interview is that we keep coming to this theme of networking, organization.
[03:01:58.451 --> 03:02:03.736]  You know, we talk about the thuggy cult, we talk about the assassins, we talk about, you know, mafia.
[03:02:04.517 --> 03:02:06.679]  Now we're talking about this group of people that
[03:02:07.358 --> 03:02:12.243]  Yeah, I don't know if they've committed any crimes or not, but there's still this network of people.
[03:02:13.144 --> 03:02:20.351]  And it goes back to every time we see something nefarious, you know, it's always connected to some network.
[03:02:21.343 --> 03:02:27.086]  You know, it's easier for humans to organize when they're connected.
[03:02:27.126 --> 03:02:30.147]  It doesn't mean, I'm not saying any of these people are committing crimes.
[03:02:30.707 --> 03:02:32.768]  You know, I'm not too familiar with the case.
[03:02:33.549 --> 03:02:37.771]  But people are better, they can conspire when they're connected.
[03:02:38.789 --> 03:02:53.278]  And so, yeah, so it doesn't surprise me that you have these local cities, governments and whatnot that are having these elitist parties now to create bonds with each other to get this, build this network, to build this connection.
[03:02:55.119 --> 03:02:55.879]  Absolutely.
[03:02:56.019 --> 03:03:02.603]  These lawyers, it's a holiday family.
[03:03:04.144 --> 03:03:07.126]  They call the elder patriarch in the family Doc Holiday.
[03:03:07.955 --> 03:03:16.877]  Darryl Holliday is one of the sons who is the attorney of, or was the attorney of Kyler.
[03:03:16.977 --> 03:03:33.422]  I'm not sure what Kyler has done at this point with his legal advisors, but up until recently, it was the Holliday family of lawyers who
[03:03:34.739 --> 03:03:39.922]  Seems to always be present when Kyler is getting in trouble and getting arrested even when it's outside of that
[03:03:59.406 --> 03:04:00.947]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:04:01.427 --> 03:04:09.171]  It just seems like there's some kind of element of organized crime here.
[03:04:09.591 --> 03:04:10.432]  Doesn't it seem like that?
[03:04:10.452 --> 03:04:12.293]  Even beyond that.
[03:04:12.573 --> 03:04:13.433]  Even beyond that.
[03:04:14.053 --> 03:04:21.457]  Because when you say organized crime, you say it in a manner that reminds us all of what we know about organized crime.
[03:04:21.777 --> 03:04:25.519]  This is something a little different.
[03:04:26.019 --> 03:04:27.560]  I mean, yes, you're right, Millie.
[03:04:27.660 --> 03:04:28.801]  It is organized crime.
[03:04:29.361 --> 03:04:35.726]  But it's another variety of it that gets mixed up with eugenics.
[03:04:38.148 --> 03:04:42.712]  They made their money off of Trojan prophylactics.
[03:04:43.853 --> 03:04:47.676]  There's a whole history to this birth control stuff and to the encouragement of abortion.
[03:04:53.982 --> 03:05:01.305]  Kyler would go out of his way to get girls pregnant just to make sure that he could be somehow party to the abortions that would happen.
[03:05:02.766 --> 03:05:03.066]  Wow.
[03:05:03.306 --> 03:05:14.131]  Didn't you say that Kyler had occult symbols inside his art that is being used to unravel where these bodies have been being found?
[03:05:16.152 --> 03:05:18.594]  Well, unfortunately, no one is doing that.
[03:05:22.757 --> 03:05:25.859]  No one is following the map that he has created.
[03:05:27.379 --> 03:05:31.201]  And this is, to me, one of the most disturbing aspects of this case.
[03:05:31.962 --> 03:05:37.785]  There's so much evidence, an abundance of it, that should be followed through.
[03:05:37.805 --> 03:05:43.848]  This painting of his has an empty chariot.
[03:05:44.669 --> 03:05:49.211]  An empty chariot that's prominent in depiction always means death.
[03:05:51.107 --> 03:05:53.488]  There's a fish with its throat slit.
[03:05:55.369 --> 03:06:10.515]  And this is exactly what Kara said was going to happen to her, according to Kyler, for something she had done that wasn't to his satisfaction, that he was going to slice her throat.
[03:06:10.615 --> 03:06:11.936]  And there is the fish
[03:06:13.016 --> 03:06:13.316]  We're good.
[03:06:26.633 --> 03:06:45.124]  Wow, okay, so he's got some occult symbols in there and it seems like some spoiled brat from an elite circle or his family's connected maybe to an elite circle and that he's out there, you know, procuring or doing this and that's just my own opinion on it.
[03:06:45.164 --> 03:06:46.625]  That's what it sounds like to me, Buff.
[03:06:47.105 --> 03:06:56.150]  But, you know, this stuff is all so interesting, and I'm sure we could talk on forever about it, but we are running out of time, and we've got a lot of other great guests.
[03:06:56.590 --> 03:07:06.595]  So thank you so much, Buff, and we will definitely have to have you come back on and give us some updates, and I know you have a lot more really interesting information on this story.
[03:07:06.615 --> 03:07:09.717]  It sounds like you're about to write a novel out of all this, right?
[03:07:10.432 --> 03:07:10.792]  Yes!
[03:07:10.892 --> 03:07:11.714]  It's very interesting.
[03:07:11.734 --> 03:07:16.381]  It wouldn't be a novel, it would be gospel truth!
[03:07:17.423 --> 03:07:18.645]  How terrifying that is.
[03:07:19.726 --> 03:07:21.830]  Okay, well thank you so much, Buff.
[03:07:22.030 --> 03:07:22.471]  Thank you.
[03:07:22.491 --> 03:07:24.234]  Well, thanks for having me back on.
[03:07:25.103 --> 03:07:25.663]  Alright, thanks.
[03:07:26.424 --> 03:07:29.646]  So, Kit, I mean, what do you make of all this?
[03:07:29.746 --> 03:07:48.759]  I mean, this is pretty insane that we actually have this case now that Buff, who is a codebreaker, he's a renowned codebreaker and he's been following this case and he's really convinced that it leads up to some of these elite circles that like to engage in this sticky behavior.
[03:07:48.779 --> 03:07:50.740]  That reminds me, what was that movie?
[03:07:51.140 --> 03:07:53.642]  Not the Silence of the Lambs, but it was like Red Dragon or something.
[03:07:53.802 --> 03:07:54.623]  It was one of the sequels.
[03:07:55.503 --> 03:08:00.986]  I want to say it reminds me of that, but reality is a lot of these movies mimic reality.
[03:08:02.067 --> 03:08:03.868]  That's what we're seeing here.
[03:08:03.968 --> 03:08:11.692]  Somebody makes the movies and maybe the people that make the movies have a little bit of an insider, you know, they've got a little bit of a tip.
[03:08:12.432 --> 03:08:14.213]  So that's pretty amazing.
[03:08:14.433 --> 03:08:22.158]  And we also, you know, we're running a little bit behind, but I definitely wanted to get right in there and see if we could talk to Brittany Pettibone.
[03:08:22.958 --> 03:08:40.008]  Brittany Pettibone is an amazing Twitter icon and she's out there a lot of times alongside Lauren Southern and they tend to go out there to these anti-fa rallies, these commie rallies, you know, they're out there standing up against the commies.
[03:08:40.948 --> 03:08:59.247]  They're there on the side of liberty and of freedom, so I wanted to get Brittany Pettibone's take on why these millennials tend to be falling in line with communism and how a lot of these anti-fascists are millennials themselves.
[03:08:59.787 --> 03:09:04.032]  So let's go ahead and see if we can talk to Brittany, but what do you think about that, Kit?
[03:09:04.352 --> 03:09:13.777]  Well, when I was in college, and this is well before the social, you know, justice warrior movement really became a fester, you saw a lot of groupthink.
[03:09:14.457 --> 03:09:19.700]  And the problem with groupthink is that it attracts the wrong ideas and it spreads to a lot of people.
[03:09:20.120 --> 03:09:25.123]  Because human psychology is simply people are scared to be isolated.
[03:09:25.383 --> 03:09:26.764]  You know, people are social animals.
[03:09:27.605 --> 03:09:31.307]  So if the group, and this goes back to what we were talking about as far as the
[03:09:32.483 --> 03:09:49.538]  You know, the networking of pedophiles is that when people get into groups and they start doing weirder and weirder and weirder stuff, no one's going to stand up and say, no, this is too much because that one person has a primal fear of being isolated by the group community.
[03:09:49.998 --> 03:09:51.319]  It's a herd mentality.
[03:09:51.399 --> 03:09:57.463]  And you know, before we go to Brittany, I just wanted to take a moment to talk about some of our awesome products.
[03:09:57.543 --> 03:10:00.124]  These are actually my products.
[03:10:00.264 --> 03:10:00.865]  I brought these.
[03:10:00.925 --> 03:10:03.366]  These are some of the products that I keep in my cupboard.
[03:10:03.927 --> 03:10:06.248]  And so I just wanted to take a couple of these.
[03:10:06.408 --> 03:10:12.672]  I'm going to take my Super Female Vitality because I'm going to get all pumped up to interview Brittany.
[03:10:15.254 --> 03:10:16.355]  Tastes really good, too.
[03:10:16.456 --> 03:10:21.320]  Like, a lot of supplements out there, they don't have a good taste, and this actually really does have a good taste.
[03:10:21.761 --> 03:10:29.148]  But I wanted to also say, guys, the reason we're doing this is because this is a broadcast to defend free speech.
[03:10:30.049 --> 03:10:33.073]  We are under attack and we need you guys.
[03:10:33.453 --> 03:10:36.356]  We are listener funded and listener supported.
[03:10:37.317 --> 03:10:39.240]  We're always out there on the front lines.
[03:10:39.540 --> 03:10:44.045]  We go to these anti-fa rallies where I just was recently for May Day.
[03:10:45.006 --> 03:10:47.987]  And we have tons of stuff on sale right now.
[03:10:48.047 --> 03:10:49.508]  We have BrainForce.
[03:10:50.108 --> 03:10:53.829]  We have BrainForce at 30% off right now.
[03:10:54.349 --> 03:10:56.030]  So make sure you guys get your BrainForce.
[03:10:56.050 --> 03:10:59.111]  That's a special we're running for this special broadcast.
[03:10:59.771 --> 03:11:01.852]  So gotta get some of that BrainForce.
[03:11:01.872 --> 03:11:03.632]  I actually have some BrainForce right here.
[03:11:03.652 --> 03:11:06.253]  I'm going to take some BrainForce.
[03:11:06.273 --> 03:11:11.895]  I actually did not take my BrainForce today, but I'm going to take some right now.
[03:11:13.226 --> 03:11:14.567]  I can get it out of this bottle.
[03:11:14.867 --> 03:11:15.327]  There we go.
[03:11:15.347 --> 03:11:16.827]  Got my water.
[03:11:16.847 --> 03:11:18.548]  I'm going to take my brain force.
[03:11:22.850 --> 03:11:23.330]  Delish.
[03:11:23.790 --> 03:11:24.250]  Delish.
[03:11:24.470 --> 03:11:25.190]  All right, guys.
[03:11:25.651 --> 03:11:28.652]  Well, let's go ahead and talk to Brittany Pettibone.
[03:11:28.692 --> 03:11:30.272]  Brittany, are you on the line?
[03:11:30.292 --> 03:11:31.613]  I am.
[03:11:31.933 --> 03:11:33.294]  Thanks so much for having me, Millie.
[03:11:34.114 --> 03:11:36.035]  Yeah, thank you for joining us, Brittany.
[03:11:36.115 --> 03:11:37.355]  So how has it been?
[03:11:37.395 --> 03:11:39.736]  I know you recently went out to a rally.
[03:11:39.756 --> 03:11:42.097]  And can you tell us about that?
[03:11:43.283 --> 03:11:46.844]  Oh sure, that was the May Day Rally in Los Angeles.
[03:11:47.424 --> 03:11:51.065]  So we anticipated there was going to be an Antifa presence.
[03:11:51.125 --> 03:11:52.825]  Most of them are communists, you know.
[03:11:53.166 --> 03:11:54.566]  So we went out there, it was fine.
[03:11:54.606 --> 03:11:56.106]  They were shooting like paintballs.
[03:11:56.126 --> 03:11:59.527]  So a couple people got, you know, one lady got shot in the face with a paintball.
[03:11:59.827 --> 03:12:04.549]  But the police had to form like a wall with their bodies in between us and them.
[03:12:04.969 --> 03:12:08.870]  A lot of them out there, they were waving Mexican flags, you know, in the United States.
[03:12:08.950 --> 03:12:09.750]  It was kind of weird.
[03:12:10.350 --> 03:12:14.180]  Things didn't get scary though until we started, until we left the event.
[03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:15.544]  So we needed a police escort.
[03:12:15.584 --> 03:12:17.990]  There were like 40, 50 policemen at least.
[03:12:18.673 --> 03:12:21.895]  The LAPD, by the way, are really good at their job.
[03:12:24.036 --> 03:12:24.897]  Very effective.
[03:12:24.937 --> 03:12:33.541]  So anyways, we had the escort out, but what the Antifa like to do is they hide behind corners and they like to jump you, you know, when you're not expecting it.
[03:12:33.602 --> 03:12:38.184]  So there was a man walking at the head of the crowd and he got jumped and punched in the face.
[03:12:38.264 --> 03:12:39.585]  So this was caught on camera.
[03:12:40.265 --> 03:12:40.726]  Wow.
[03:12:40.846 --> 03:12:42.827]  And they like to attack women too.
[03:12:42.847 --> 03:12:46.529]  They tend to like to pick on women, old people, and children.
[03:12:48.797 --> 03:12:50.778]  Oh yeah, there's no one they won't go after.
[03:12:51.378 --> 03:12:53.539]  So yeah, but they usually travel in groups.
[03:12:53.639 --> 03:13:00.782]  Like, you're not gonna have one Antifa who's gonna come after you and, you know, fight you, you know, face-to-face, just like that.
[03:13:00.982 --> 03:13:06.725]  They're in groups, and if they get unmasked or they feel overpowered, then they scatter and disperse.
[03:13:06.745 --> 03:13:08.105]  A lot of these Antifa are really young.
[03:13:08.145 --> 03:13:13.408]  They're like, like you said, millennials, younger kids, college students, and then a lot are also professors.
[03:13:14.255 --> 03:13:19.638]  And that is really scary, you know, that the teachers and their students are out there together.
[03:13:19.658 --> 03:13:22.880]  I feel like, you know, they're being indoctrinated by their teachers.
[03:13:23.160 --> 03:13:35.368]  But also, again, these people, like this kind of atmosphere has been primed by the, you know, the mainstream media essentially created it during the election and made us look like Nazis and Trump is Hitler.
[03:13:35.468 --> 03:13:40.511]  And it just, it completely, you know, made it perfect for this kind of situation to develop.
[03:13:40.871 --> 03:13:42.552]  So this is just the result of that.
[03:13:43.700 --> 03:14:03.086]  Yeah definitely and you know like you were saying how you see these young students out there and it was actually kind of funny because on May Day when I was out there and a lot of the other InfoWars crew came out there to join both me and Gavin and I actually asked the commies while they were in their little huddle they were all like
[03:14:03.766 --> 03:14:04.787]  A linked arm in arm.
[03:14:04.867 --> 03:14:07.868]  I said, who's a student at UT?
[03:14:07.908 --> 03:14:09.589]  And one of them actually raised their hand.
[03:14:09.909 --> 03:14:10.949]  I thought that was really funny.
[03:14:10.969 --> 03:14:12.730]  I was like, oh my gosh.
[03:14:13.250 --> 03:14:15.371]  Yeah, they're college students.
[03:14:15.611 --> 03:14:18.352]  When you ask them, hey, are you going to UT?
[03:14:18.412 --> 03:14:19.393]  Are you a college student?
[03:14:19.613 --> 03:14:20.834]  They go, why should I tell you?
[03:14:20.934 --> 03:14:22.214]  And they get all overly defensive.
[03:14:22.234 --> 03:14:24.915]  But you can tell that they, in fact, are.
[03:14:25.035 --> 03:14:25.916]  And the real question is,
[03:14:26.536 --> 03:14:48.907]  These professors that are out there with them, I mean, people are sending their young adults to these universities not realizing you guys are sending them to Marxist professors who are going to indoctrinate them and you're going to get, like we saw with Moldy Locks, you know, she was this beautiful young lady
[03:14:49.947 --> 03:14:58.256]  Completely classy and then it's just you could tell like that's someone's daughter and then she turns out to be this antifa with nasty dreadlocks.
[03:14:58.396 --> 03:15:00.198]  She's she did some porn.
[03:15:00.238 --> 03:15:02.460]  I mean it's just pretty crazy.
[03:15:02.480 --> 03:15:03.701]  What do you think about that Brittany?
[03:15:04.162 --> 03:15:10.829]  Yeah, I mean the guy actually who hit one of one of our guys with a bike lock over the head was a professor.
[03:15:12.064 --> 03:15:15.567]  I think he works at a college in Santa Cruz if I'm not mistaken.
[03:15:16.228 --> 03:15:18.149]  And so apparently he's on the run now.
[03:15:18.169 --> 03:15:21.952]  I don't know if they've caught him yet, but the victim is pressing charges.
[03:15:21.972 --> 03:15:23.733]  But yeah, this guy is a professor.
[03:15:23.753 --> 03:15:25.254]  An ethics professor.
[03:15:25.274 --> 03:15:30.818]  Yeah, because it's ethical to hit somebody over the head with a bike lock.
[03:15:31.519 --> 03:15:33.280]  What do you think about this kid, Daniels?
[03:15:34.631 --> 03:15:43.575]  With colleges, of course it's going to attract Marxists as professors, because honestly, that's about the only job they can get.
[03:15:44.335 --> 03:15:48.276]  When people are really radical like that, it doesn't really matter what their political stance is.
[03:15:50.117 --> 03:15:53.399]  You know, push people away because people in general are not that extreme.
[03:15:53.539 --> 03:15:57.882]  So yeah, they see someone who's really extreme, it's like, you know, I don't know about this guy.
[03:15:57.902 --> 03:16:04.346]  Case in point, I was at a networking group here in Austin like several years ago and there was this one guy there that was, he worked for the city.
[03:16:05.206 --> 03:16:06.628]  This guy was a tyrant.
[03:16:06.688 --> 03:16:08.211]  He got off on power.
[03:16:08.491 --> 03:16:11.155]  He was talking about how he wanted the city to buy drones.
[03:16:11.275 --> 03:16:13.038]  He was a city compliance officer.
[03:16:13.058 --> 03:16:21.129]  He was talking about how he wanted to get drones throughout the city so he can spy on people and bust them for having too many mosquitoes in their backyard and this and that.
[03:16:21.730 --> 03:16:25.133]  And I'm like, this guy, regardless of his politics, the guy's extreme.
[03:16:25.753 --> 03:16:28.395]  So yeah, everyone started shying away from him.
[03:16:29.095 --> 03:16:36.441]  And that's the thing that you're seeing here is like, you get a lot of college professors that are, they got these really, they're really antisocial.
[03:16:36.501 --> 03:16:39.343]  They have this weird extreme ideology.
[03:16:39.363 --> 03:16:41.945]  And yeah, it's about the only job they can get.
[03:16:42.325 --> 03:16:46.748]  Unfortunately, the only job they can get is the job they shouldn't have.
[03:16:46.768 --> 03:16:50.571]  And that's basically gives them the ability to indoctrinate young children.
[03:16:51.041 --> 03:16:55.544]  Yeah, young adults who, they're still forming their minds and their perception of the world.
[03:16:56.045 --> 03:17:05.392]  And you know, there have been studies out there that talk about, you know, 18% of college university professors identified as Marxist.
[03:17:05.512 --> 03:17:07.613]  I mean, that's an alarming number right there.
[03:17:08.154 --> 03:17:13.638]  Only, what was it, 6% identified as conservatives?
[03:17:14.358 --> 03:17:18.579]  When you have a large portion of Americans as conservatives.
[03:17:18.899 --> 03:17:22.380]  So that's not really a really fair balance right there.
[03:17:22.440 --> 03:17:26.560]  And the rest of the professors identified as liberals or democrats.
[03:17:27.020 --> 03:17:31.841]  So we have a little bit of a problem of ideological discrimination in the universities.
[03:17:32.221 --> 03:17:39.123]  And we're seeing the disasters that are coming out of that.
[03:17:39.563 --> 03:17:40.723]  What do you think about that, Brittany?
[03:17:41.503 --> 03:17:45.027]  Yeah, I mean, this is actually why a bunch of us have gone together.
[03:17:46.144 --> 03:17:51.448]  You know, on social media, and we're declaring the month of May Communism Awareness Month.
[03:17:51.768 --> 03:17:57.953]  So all of us throughout the month of May are going to be tweeting about all the atrocities, you know, that Communism, Neo-Marxism have caused.
[03:17:58.253 --> 03:18:00.415]  Because it seems like these people aren't even aware.
[03:18:00.775 --> 03:18:03.997]  Like, they haven't been educated, and they don't regard it as something negative.
[03:18:04.297 --> 03:18:08.661]  But it's killed, like, millions upon millions upon millions of people, and it never works.
[03:18:09.321 --> 03:18:11.143]  I mean, go look at Venezuela right now.
[03:18:12.083 --> 03:18:27.240]  It's so true though, Brittany, and that's actually perfect because there is a YouGov study, okay, this study is pretty amazing, and it talked about how millennials don't have basic knowledge of communism.
[03:18:27.701 --> 03:18:33.007]  And what was really interesting here is to see the different generations that were all polled.
[03:18:33.527 --> 03:18:52.458]  I mean, you had your matures, which were like the elderly, you had the baby boomers, you had Generation X, you had Millennials, and then Generation Z. And what was interesting to see in this study was that Millennials were, 42% of Millennials were unaware or unfamiliar with Mao Zedong, 40% were unfamiliar with Che Guevara,
[03:18:57.541 --> 03:18:59.963]  They probably think Pol Pot's a type of weed, you know?
[03:19:00.063 --> 03:19:03.645]  Yeah, I mean, a lot of them just didn't know the facts about communism.
[03:19:04.166 --> 03:19:15.233]  And even those who were familiar with it, actually there was a significant percentage of them that had favorable impressions of Guevara, Marx, and Lenin.
[03:19:15.253 --> 03:19:22.077]  You know, a couple years ago I did this article on the Tiananmen Square incident, you know, Tank Man 1989, the protest.
[03:19:23.238 --> 03:19:29.641]  And I think it was PBS, they sent journalists to the Beijing University where the protests originated.
[03:19:30.962 --> 03:19:38.106]  And they asked like 100 students, they showed them the photo of the Tank Man and they asked them, you know what this is, can you identify this?
[03:19:38.766 --> 03:19:41.827]  Only like 15 out of 100 people knew what it was.
[03:19:42.087 --> 03:19:46.930]  Most people, most of the students there, they looked at it bewildered and they thought it was a piece of artwork.
[03:19:47.370 --> 03:19:56.573]  That's because the Communist Chinese government has done such a phenomenal job in censorship that students, they don't even know basic history from 25 years ago.
[03:19:57.034 --> 03:20:05.037]  So how can they expect people to know history from like 50, 100 years ago when communism was really on the rise with the revolutions of 1917 and so forth?
[03:20:06.837 --> 03:20:11.681]  Well Brittany, I think that's pretty amazing how you guys have thought of this idea.
[03:20:11.781 --> 03:20:13.142]  It's a brilliant idea.
[03:20:13.242 --> 03:20:16.685]  Everyone should be out there tweeting about communism.
[03:20:16.765 --> 03:20:28.375]  Tweet facts about communism because apparently the public is grossly, they grossly underestimate the death toll when it comes to these communist regimes.
[03:20:28.795 --> 03:20:32.879]  They don't realize that nearly a hundred million people
[03:20:33.499 --> 03:20:35.961]  ...have died in the name of communism.
[03:20:36.581 --> 03:20:42.485]  And according to this study here, it says that 75% of the public got that question wrong.
[03:20:42.825 --> 03:20:47.148]  They really grossly underestimated how many people died because of communism.
[03:20:48.072 --> 03:20:48.832]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:20:48.872 --> 03:20:51.733]  I mean, we're facing it here in our country, and it's very violent.
[03:20:51.793 --> 03:20:52.473]  It's Antifa.
[03:20:52.493 --> 03:20:58.995]  You know, they use the name Antifa, but in reality, they are communists, and that's what they seem to be fighting for.
[03:20:59.495 --> 03:21:06.597]  So we're, you know, doing what we can to combat them online, but then it's also very important to take a stand in real life.
[03:21:06.657 --> 03:21:08.917]  That's why we all feel that it's so important to it.
[03:21:08.937 --> 03:21:10.558]  I'm making an effort to attend rallies.
[03:21:10.998 --> 03:21:14.779]  So there's one, there's two that we're planning in New Orleans over the next few weeks.
[03:21:15.379 --> 03:21:19.686]  I probably wanted to be able to attend the first one because I'm actually going to go to France on Friday to...
[03:21:20.675 --> 03:21:25.938]  Live stream some of the French elections, so that should be pretty crazy, particularly if Le Pen wins, so we'll see.
[03:21:26.738 --> 03:21:32.381]  But then in about three weeks, we're going to have another rally in New Orleans, and I will be attending and most likely speaking there.
[03:21:32.681 --> 03:21:37.583]  But the point, the reason we're doing it is because the city, they're trying to rip down all the monuments.
[03:21:38.123 --> 03:21:44.987]  Robert E. Lee, Andrew Jackson, George Washington, and so you have a bunch of people who want to preserve our culture.
[03:21:45.567 --> 03:21:52.152]  And who are standing out in front of the monuments, camping out there, and they're being challenged and sometimes violently assaulted by Antifa.
[03:21:52.593 --> 03:21:57.756]  I think they drove by in like a massive truck the other night and assaulted some people who were guarding the monuments.
[03:21:58.197 --> 03:21:59.298]  So it's getting bad out there.
[03:22:00.188 --> 03:22:01.249]  Yes, it definitely is.
[03:22:01.329 --> 03:22:02.269]  It's getting violent.
[03:22:02.309 --> 03:22:04.550]  There's a lot of problems that we're seeing arise here.
[03:22:04.931 --> 03:22:09.793]  And we are going to be having George Peterson on later on in this broadcast.
[03:22:10.313 --> 03:22:15.756]  We're going to be, Kit and I are going to be sitting down and talking to him exactly about what Brittany just talked about.
[03:22:15.796 --> 03:22:22.800]  How, you know, people are having to go out and defend these monuments because the Antifa want to rip them down in the name of political correctness.
[03:22:22.820 --> 03:22:24.301]  That's what I said earlier about history.
[03:22:24.421 --> 03:22:26.722]  Once you destroy history, you can recreate history.
[03:22:26.742 --> 03:22:27.102]  Since 1984.
[03:22:28.615 --> 03:22:35.497]  That's right, and so I kind of wanted to get into, you know, how are these Millennials being created?
[03:22:35.517 --> 03:22:40.779]  I really want to get into this, you know, was it a matter of when Millennials grew up?
[03:22:40.879 --> 03:22:48.322]  Because I myself am a Millennial, and Brittany's a Millennial, and you know, I wanted to get into that, how 9-11 has greatly shaped
[03:22:51.443 --> 03:22:54.145]  You know, they've shaped the lives of Millennials.
[03:22:54.666 --> 03:23:03.293]  They've shaped the industry that left after 9-11 has greatly shaped Millennials' points of views, as well as the housing crash.
[03:23:03.693 --> 03:23:10.519]  So those are all things that could be playing into why these Millennials have these views that they do.
[03:23:10.939 --> 03:23:12.020]  What do you think about that, Kit?
[03:23:12.961 --> 03:23:19.086]  Well, you know, as far as the 9-11 thing, you know, you've got a pre-9-11 and a post-9-11 world.
[03:23:20.529 --> 03:23:21.630]  Like you're talking about.
[03:23:22.271 --> 03:23:26.055]  And I think that's really created a divide even amongst Millennials.
[03:23:26.415 --> 03:23:37.587]  That, you know, Millennials that grew up, you know, after 9-11, you know, with text messaging the internet, but by then you already had the Bush administration pushing propaganda
[03:23:38.548 --> 03:23:47.290]  And, you know, it was already kind of forming this collective mindset amongst millennials to be dependent on the government, trust the government.
[03:23:47.331 --> 03:23:56.453]  Even though they hated Bush, they still were basically being pushed into this idea where they couldn't think amongst themselves.
[03:23:56.633 --> 03:23:59.774]  They were just spoon-fed narratives by the mainstream media.
[03:24:00.254 --> 03:24:02.775]  So yeah, the same mainstream media that attacked Bush
[03:24:03.843 --> 03:24:13.913]  Love to Obama, but it doesn't matter because they both had the same policies and going back to what I was talking about earlier about how Marxist professors, you know, they can't find another job.
[03:24:13.973 --> 03:24:15.956]  You know, it's that's only part of the problem.
[03:24:16.376 --> 03:24:23.884]  What you have is a global establishment that intentionally staffs academia with people that they can control.
[03:24:24.384 --> 03:24:26.885]  That includes people that have ideologies that they can control.
[03:24:26.905 --> 03:24:33.087]  I mean, there's no coincidence that communism was funded by Wall Street bankers, because communist governments are typically unstable.
[03:24:33.507 --> 03:24:44.272]  And that allows, you know, international globalists and corporate interests to go into a country and strip-mine its resources, just like what you saw with Russia in the 1920s.
[03:24:45.922 --> 03:24:46.502]  Exactly.
[03:24:46.562 --> 03:24:48.463]  I mean, Brittany, what do you think about all this?
[03:24:48.483 --> 03:24:57.346]  Because I kind of wanted to ask you, from millennial, you know, to millennial, or at least I'll talk to you about this too, Kit.
[03:24:58.026 --> 03:24:58.726]  What do you think?
[03:24:58.826 --> 03:25:06.649]  I mean, as millennials, I remember seeing the Bush administration, everybody unhappy, hating on Bush.
[03:25:07.349 --> 03:25:14.312]  And as a young, you know, young child, I was really kind of in the mindset of, well, Bush is a bad guy then, because everybody's hating on Bush.
[03:25:14.992 --> 03:25:24.016]  And then, once Obama got in, everybody then was really unhappy with Obama because Obama sold everyone down the river, right?
[03:25:24.316 --> 03:25:32.399]  So, the Millennials saw both the Republicans fail the American people's interests, and then the Democrats fail the American people's interests.
[03:25:32.759 --> 03:25:33.780]  So what I wonder is,
[03:25:34.660 --> 03:26:01.126]  Is that why they're wanting to throw the entire system out, is because they feel like it's so corrupt that it's never going to take care of the people who are suffering, the poor people, whereas the people who lost their houses in the housing crisis, the people who, you know, they couldn't get any good jobs anymore because all of the industry started leaving after 9-11 due to, you know, some of the previous things that came into play, such as NAFTA.
[03:26:01.146 --> 03:26:02.947]  I mean, what's your take on that, Kit?
[03:26:03.547 --> 03:26:27.198]  Well, the whole job thing, I was just finishing college during the 08 crisis, and I was about to go into a master's program in real estate development, but the problem is, the reason I didn't get into it was that it was right when the housing collapse started, and one of the requirements of the master's program was for you to get an internship with a real estate development firm.
[03:26:28.178 --> 03:26:34.581]  And they were struggling to put their students, find their students internships because there was no jobs in that industry at the time.
[03:26:35.281 --> 03:26:40.283]  And so I decided, you know, just finish out my BS in economics, just go get a job from there.
[03:26:41.043 --> 03:26:45.285]  But by then it's like, oh, I think I only interviewed with like three or four companies.
[03:26:45.745 --> 03:26:48.906]  You know, a year or two before that, I probably would interview with 50 or 100 companies.
[03:26:50.447 --> 03:27:03.235]  And I also heard, like, in 2003, like, if you could have graduated UT Austin down the street from here, you know, from the law school, you'd make an easy $100,000 out of college if you ranked well in the program.
[03:27:04.264 --> 03:27:08.265]  But after the 08 collapse, you know, it's like 50 grand.
[03:27:08.926 --> 03:27:18.529]  And it got to the point that there's less and less students that are wanting to go into debt to get in these programs if there's not any jobs available for them.
[03:27:18.569 --> 03:27:21.190]  And it creates this learned helplessness.
[03:27:21.650 --> 03:27:22.111]  Exactly.
[03:27:22.351 --> 03:27:35.684]  With what you're talking about, it says here in these little shocking stats about Millennials, it says Millennials are the most educated generation in American history with over 63% of Millennials having a bachelor's degree.
[03:27:36.205 --> 03:27:36.886]  How will
[03:27:37.446 --> 03:27:40.388]  They stand out in today's overcrowded talent pool.
[03:27:40.408 --> 03:27:56.197]  So the problem is a lot of them are getting these, they've been getting these expensive student loans which these loan sharks give them and then they end up paying like some insane interest which will take them forever to pay off the loan and then when they get out of the field
[03:27:56.877 --> 03:28:12.281]  You know, out of college with their degree, the market is already oversaturated with degrees and then they end up just having to work some minimum wage job out there because all of the industry jobs have already left.
[03:28:12.561 --> 03:28:19.443]  So we're seeing this problem here where these millennials actually, they have gotten screwed, okay, they really have.
[03:28:20.023 --> 03:28:40.255]  But they don't realize that they don't realize who screwed them and that we could actually fix it and this is why people are saying let's make America great again because there was a time when people could have higher paying industrial jobs in America prior to all of these businesses leaving overseas.
[03:28:40.796 --> 03:28:44.358]  Yeah, what I was saying about learned helplessness is this idea that
[03:28:45.612 --> 03:28:48.274]  You know, these kids, they get these bachelor's degrees.
[03:28:48.314 --> 03:28:58.444]  For example, I knew this girl that was a bartender here in Austin, and she was like in her 30s, and she had a good degree from a really prestigious school, but she'd been working as a bartender for 10 years.
[03:28:59.324 --> 03:29:07.472]  She developed a learned helplessness in that she didn't want to even bother to go out and try to find another job because she had already tried that for like five, six years.
[03:29:07.512 --> 03:29:08.312]  There's nothing out there.
[03:29:09.153 --> 03:29:13.696]  But the problem with that is that the learned helplessness creates this dependency on the government.
[03:29:13.956 --> 03:29:24.963]  So it's no coincidence that a lot of these kids are now going out and supporting Bernie Sanders, who's promising all this free stuff, because they developed this learned helplessness that they can't get this free stuff on their own.
[03:29:25.403 --> 03:29:26.964]  And that's exactly what the government wants.
[03:29:26.984 --> 03:29:29.225]  They want dependent students.
[03:29:29.585 --> 03:29:38.531]  When people are dependent on the government, they're just going to go along with what the government says, including, let's go to war in Syria, let's go to war in Iraq.
[03:29:39.189 --> 03:29:48.294]  That's right, and you know, a lot of these communists are saying that they just want that guarantee that they're gonna get theirs, you know, and it's from this fear of scarcity.
[03:29:48.714 --> 03:29:54.478]  But you know, that's why we're out there, you know, we're out there talking to these anti-fascists, these commies.
[03:29:54.778 --> 03:29:56.359]  We're trying to wake them up.
[03:29:56.859 --> 03:30:03.022]  Let's all come together and try to red pill these millennials, because here's the fact.
[03:30:03.062 --> 03:30:05.384]  I mean, we could just brush them off and say, you know what?
[03:30:06.044 --> 03:30:09.966]  These millennials, they just need to go cry in their mommy's basements.
[03:30:10.026 --> 03:30:12.348]  But here's the scary fact here.
[03:30:13.669 --> 03:30:15.730]  Listen to this statistic right here.
[03:30:15.750 --> 03:30:17.711]  This is absolutely terrifying.
[03:30:17.731 --> 03:30:20.993]  63.3% of U.S.
[03:30:21.073 --> 03:30:25.696]  executives will be eligible to retire in the next five years.
[03:30:26.276 --> 03:30:29.518]  This leaves a large leadership gap.
[03:30:29.938 --> 03:30:32.639]  That will have to be filled by millennials.
[03:30:33.060 --> 03:30:42.084]  So we're going to have a large amount of millennials coming into power positions in the next five years as these baby boomers retire, which is pretty scary.
[03:30:42.124 --> 03:30:53.990]  So we really do need to start focusing on how can we speak to these millennials out there and red pill them before they end up dictating our lives and dragging us into some socialist
[03:30:54.930 --> 03:31:00.856]  Government that's going to be run by someone like Bernie Sanders, but you know, that's why please support us guys.
[03:31:01.397 --> 03:31:03.179]  We're out there on the front line.
[03:31:03.840 --> 03:31:05.341]  We're out there talking to these people.
[03:31:05.361 --> 03:31:09.325]  We're going to be, you know, doing everything we can to red pill these millennials.
[03:31:10.379 --> 03:31:16.205]  So to support our 30-hour broadcast, I mean, we've had so much of the crew out here today.
[03:31:16.225 --> 03:31:18.747]  I mean, they have been really working hard.
[03:31:19.168 --> 03:31:21.790]  We also have some amazing deals out there.
[03:31:22.211 --> 03:31:24.653]  You know, we've got Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:31:24.753 --> 03:31:26.054]  I love that on my own.
[03:31:26.114 --> 03:31:28.577]  But we have some stuff that's on sale as well.
[03:31:28.597 --> 03:31:31.680]  We've got 30% off Brain Force Plus.
[03:31:32.120 --> 03:31:32.441]  We have 20% off.
[03:31:34.042 --> 03:31:37.143]  Secret 12, which is vitamin B12.
[03:31:37.563 --> 03:31:43.866]  It tastes amazing, has a very fruity flavor, and it gives you just this zing of energy when you take it.
[03:31:44.406 --> 03:31:50.729]  We have DNA Force, which is now back in stock, so make sure you get that DNA Force.
[03:31:51.369 --> 03:31:54.251]  It's our highly advanced DNA Force formula.
[03:31:54.271 --> 03:32:05.359]  It has been sold out for months due to a worldwide shortage of raw ingredients that has drastically affected our ability to manufacture this formula.
[03:32:05.439 --> 03:32:06.740]  So get it while you can.
[03:32:06.840 --> 03:32:08.561]  It is a very hot item, guys.
[03:32:08.961 --> 03:32:12.263]  We also have 20% off winter sun.
[03:32:12.824 --> 03:32:14.345]  So make sure you guys support us.
[03:32:14.405 --> 03:32:20.249]  We are out here defending free speech, defending liberty, and we will come back, when we do come back,
[03:32:20.649 --> 03:32:33.403]  We are going to talk to George Peterson, who's been out there protecting these American historical monuments from these commies who want to tear them down in the name of political correctness.
[03:32:33.884 --> 03:32:34.745]  We'll be right back, guys.
[03:32:46.297 --> 03:32:48.178]  I joke around a lot on the air.
[03:32:48.338 --> 03:32:49.238]  I try to have a good time.
[03:32:49.858 --> 03:32:51.039]  I'm a happy person overall.
[03:32:51.919 --> 03:32:59.462]  But I have intellectually studied the globalist program and I understand it is a major threat to myself and my family and your family as well.
[03:33:00.482 --> 03:33:05.204]  Now we do have some gallows humor around here, but when you get down to the bedrock of our message, it's dire.
[03:33:06.184 --> 03:33:09.065]  Globalism is an anti-human system.
[03:33:09.325 --> 03:33:10.706]  It's a breakaway civilization.
[03:33:11.769 --> 03:33:22.837]  The elites believe humanity's finished and are basically stealing our wealth, our intellectual property, and our very essence to construct their new world order system.
[03:33:23.938 --> 03:33:27.480]  Now, I never started Infowars 22 years ago believing I would save the world.
[03:33:27.741 --> 03:33:29.202]  I just wanted to be a watchman on the wall.
[03:33:30.427 --> 03:33:37.811]  A modern Paul Revere who could warn people about the threats, and I believe that humanity, when faced with a threat, would take action against it.
[03:33:38.451 --> 03:33:43.634]  So many times globalists would tell me that, oh Alex, they're a bunch of cowards, you're just scaring them for us.
[03:33:44.215 --> 03:33:53.800]  And I would always say, no, humanity, at least a large part of it, when faced with the truth, will do what it takes to defeat your unelected planetary dictatorship.
[03:33:54.460 --> 03:34:01.684]  Wednesday, May 3rd, and Thursday, May 4th, we're doing a 30-hour transmission that kicked off at 11 a.m.
[03:34:02.105 --> 03:34:02.605]  on Wednesday.
[03:34:03.625 --> 03:34:08.288]  And we've got Congressman Ron Paul and so many other amazing patriots joining us.
[03:34:08.969 --> 03:34:14.412]  I hope that you'll do several things during this important transmission to defend free speech and defend what's left of the West.
[03:34:15.032 --> 03:34:26.475]  I hope you'll spread the link at Infowars.com forward slash show to new people who've never heard of the show, or who have heard of us being demonized in the national news, but have not actually heard the message.
[03:34:27.296 --> 03:34:29.476]  Tell people, this is the forbidden message.
[03:34:29.796 --> 03:34:31.457]  This is the show they don't want you to hear.
[03:34:31.757 --> 03:34:33.918]  This is the show the globalists are afraid of.
[03:34:34.318 --> 03:34:39.279]  That's why they're trying to assassinate my character, my crew's character, and the rest of our host's character.
[03:34:39.539 --> 03:34:44.381]  Because they understand we're promoting freedom, open society, goodwill.
[03:34:45.373 --> 03:34:47.755]  The globalists are selling division and evil.
[03:34:48.175 --> 03:34:51.899]  So please spread the word about the live transmission so we can reach new people.
[03:34:51.959 --> 03:34:52.479]  That's the goal.
[03:34:52.619 --> 03:34:54.741]  Will this 30-hour broadcast save the world?
[03:34:54.821 --> 03:34:55.041]  No.
[03:34:55.462 --> 03:35:01.067]  But it is the spirit of defiance and the incremental march against tyranny that overall will save the world.
[03:35:01.547 --> 03:35:05.510]  My friends, we can come together as one human race that bleeds red blood.
[03:35:06.371 --> 03:35:06.651]  Thank you.
[03:35:21.288 --> 03:35:24.170]  And also financially support us because that's what funds us.
[03:35:24.491 --> 03:35:34.899]  We don't have George Soros or the Ford Foundation or the federal government funding us like MSNBC and CNN or the Saudis and the Mexican kingpin Carlos Slim funding the New York Times.
[03:35:35.379 --> 03:35:49.991]  We have people like you buying Molon Labe t-shirts and high-quality non-GMO heirloom seed banks to plant summer and fall gardens and high-quality water filtration systems that are the very best out there at the lowest prices.
[03:35:50.431 --> 03:35:55.095]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products at infowarestore.com.
[03:35:55.415 --> 03:36:00.839]  We have a huge line of nutraceuticals, many of which are household names that we've private labeled at lower prices.
[03:36:00.859 --> 03:36:02.541]  A lot of stuff that Whole Foods carries.
[03:36:02.801 --> 03:36:09.046]  And many of which I've developed with top producers, scientists, and researchers, like Knockout, our amazing sleep aid.
[03:36:09.466 --> 03:36:19.654]  And when you purchase these products, it funds what we're doing and really puts a stick in the eye of the globalists like George Soros and others that are doing everything they can right now to shut us down.
[03:36:20.134 --> 03:36:22.696]  The law firm George Soros funded is suing me right now.
[03:36:23.176 --> 03:36:26.159]  A member of the Federal Reserve Board of New York is suing me right now.
[03:36:26.539 --> 03:36:33.084]  The globalists are doing everything they can to silence us and to demonize me and to destroy my family, quite frankly.
[03:36:34.265 --> 03:36:39.169]  But they're following the arrogance of the elite that has brought them down throughout history.
[03:36:39.510 --> 03:36:41.391]  Because the world sees the attacks.
[03:36:41.451 --> 03:36:42.272]  They see the lies.
[03:36:42.592 --> 03:36:43.693]  They see the demonization.
[03:36:44.474 --> 03:36:48.277]  And so we've never had more visitors, more traffic at InfoWars.com.
[03:36:49.926 --> 03:36:58.733]  The problem is the attacks are sustained, they're intensifying, and so even though we're growing, it's not quite fast enough to be able to defeat their attack profile.
[03:36:59.133 --> 03:37:10.101]  So that's why I'm asking you to double down so they see us really grow, not just stay the same, and understand that their attempts to shut us down will be met with total resolve and commitment.
[03:37:10.521 --> 03:37:15.705]  We have huge specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:37:16.946 --> 03:37:20.270]  On hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of amazing products that's a win-win.
[03:37:20.410 --> 03:37:25.515]  Products you need, products that fund our operation, so that we can then expose the globalist program.
[03:37:25.615 --> 03:37:27.537]  It's a total 360 win.
[03:37:27.978 --> 03:37:30.660]  A limited time, DNA Force is now back in stock.

[03:37:53.185 --> 03:37:54.967]  Prostagard, incredible formula.
[03:37:55.467 --> 03:37:59.468]  Winter Sun, the knockout that I mentioned, and so many other great products.
[03:37:59.508 --> 03:38:01.088]  And then finally, let me see if it's still here.
[03:38:01.228 --> 03:38:01.488]  It is.
[03:38:01.869 --> 03:38:04.349]  This just came back in after two months being sold out.
[03:38:04.789 --> 03:38:08.050]  Super blue, high quality, organic toothpaste.
[03:38:08.790 --> 03:38:13.791]  Fluoride-free with iodine, with colloidal silver, with tea tree oil and peppermint oil.
[03:38:14.132 --> 03:38:15.032]  It's concentrated.
[03:38:15.092 --> 03:38:17.912]  My dad is a quasi-retired dentist, oral surgeon.
[03:38:18.152 --> 03:38:21.333]  He helped develop this with one of the biggest manufacturers in the country.
[03:38:21.453 --> 03:38:22.153]  It's amazing.
[03:38:22.554 --> 03:38:24.134]  And again, when you sign up for AutoShip,
[03:38:24.534 --> 03:38:26.175]  You get an additional 10% off.
[03:38:26.255 --> 03:38:26.895]  It's a win-win.
[03:38:27.355 --> 03:38:31.236]  You remember to support us each month or every two months or every three months, however you sign up.
[03:38:31.616 --> 03:38:42.500]  You can cancel anytime and you can get 10% off and then don't have to remember to keep supporting us and also get the products that obviously run out that you've got to replenish.
[03:38:42.740 --> 03:38:44.280]  These are great renewable resources.
[03:38:44.600 --> 03:38:46.021]  Please continue to support us again.
[03:38:47.190 --> 03:38:48.291]  I want to defeat the globalists.
[03:38:48.371 --> 03:38:49.011]  I'm determined.
[03:38:49.091 --> 03:38:49.632]  I'm focused.
[03:38:50.152 --> 03:38:58.057]  But without you spreading the word, without you financially supporting us, and without you praying for us, we don't have a chance in hell.
[03:38:58.477 --> 03:39:00.258]  But if you get behind us like you've already done,
[03:39:01.906 --> 03:39:02.827]  Turn it up a notch?
[03:39:03.507 --> 03:39:07.050]  We are unstoppable, ladies and gentlemen, because humans want freedom.
[03:39:07.370 --> 03:39:09.671]  We want to have a shared destiny together.
[03:39:09.912 --> 03:39:11.092]  We want to go to the stars.
[03:39:11.493 --> 03:39:12.734]  Look how far we've already come.
[03:39:12.974 --> 03:39:14.715]  So let's tell the globalists we're not trash.
[03:39:15.015 --> 03:39:18.017]  Let's tell Bill Guy, the science guy, that we're going to have more than one child.
[03:39:18.277 --> 03:39:21.319]  Let's tell David Rockefeller that, you know, we're not subhumans.
[03:39:21.600 --> 03:39:25.803]  Let's tell Ted Turner, who could have five kids, but tells us we're subhuman, he can go to hell.
[03:39:26.103 --> 03:39:27.344]  And let's take action.

[03:40:14.406 --> 03:40:23.549]  I'm Millie Weaver, and I'm joined here by Kit Daniels, and you are watching the 30-hour broadcast of the Freedom of Speech Defense!
[03:40:24.189 --> 03:40:28.551]  So, I just wanted to thank Brittany Pettibone, who joined us this last segment.
[03:40:28.571 --> 03:40:34.853]  It looks like we lost her feed, but thank you so much, Brittany Pettibone, for joining us, and thank you for what you're doing.
[03:40:35.693 --> 03:40:39.435]  And I would just follow her on Twitter if you guys haven't done that yet.
[03:40:39.795 --> 03:41:01.464]  But we are actually going to be joined by George Peterson, who has been leading some efforts to protect these American monuments out in Louisiana that have been under attack by Antifa and other liberal and Marxist people in government that want them torn down in the name of political correctness.
[03:41:01.824 --> 03:41:04.845]  So let's go ahead and get right to George Peterson.
[03:41:07.162 --> 03:41:08.502]  Hey George, how's it going?
[03:41:09.363 --> 03:41:10.063]  Great, great.
[03:41:10.123 --> 03:41:10.723]  Good evening.
[03:41:10.763 --> 03:41:12.544]  Hi Kid, hey Millie, how y'all doing?
[03:41:13.224 --> 03:41:13.644]  Good, good.
[03:41:14.124 --> 03:41:14.784]  Doing great.
[03:41:14.824 --> 03:41:24.407]  So George, do you want to tell us a little bit about some of the events that have been going on over there in Louisiana with these statues and the anti-fog commies coming to attack them?
[03:41:25.663 --> 03:41:41.346]  Well, basically it started about two years ago when Mitch Landrieu, who is our ultra-liberal mayor here in New Orleans, decided to use this as a distraction issue away from his failed policies here in the city.
[03:41:41.766 --> 03:41:45.466]  Of course, most liberal cities fail.
[03:41:46.787 --> 03:41:49.267]  Mitch Landrieu's is no different here in New Orleans.
[03:41:49.627 --> 03:41:54.088]  We have high murder rates, high violent crime, high poverty.
[03:41:55.969 --> 03:42:02.633]  Unemployment, we have failed infrastructure, huge potholes and sinkholes that go unrepaired.
[03:42:03.054 --> 03:42:03.634]  But Ms.
[03:42:03.674 --> 03:42:19.606]  Landrieu wants to spend the past two years distracting everybody from that and focusing in on removing these historical monuments that have been standing in our public spaces in the great city of New Orleans for over a hundred years.
[03:42:21.087 --> 03:42:29.934]  Wow, so these are pieces of America's history right there and the Antifa commies, they just want to tear them down.
[03:42:30.355 --> 03:42:35.319]  Can you tell us a little bit about how this is part of a communist agenda to tear these down?
[03:42:36.736 --> 03:42:57.080]  Well, actually the Marxist Communist Malcolm Suber, him and another gentleman from New York whose name is Quest Moore, they met with a gentleman named John Cummings who has a plantation outside of New Orleans and they are trying to turn that into a
[03:42:58.900 --> 03:43:09.124]  So, their whole scheme was to see how they could basically abscond the monuments of Robert E. Lee, P.G.T.
[03:43:09.164 --> 03:43:20.228]  Beauregard, and Jefferson Davis from New Orleans, and Mitch Landrieu basically sided with them and, you know, figured out that he'd be a part of the scheme.
[03:43:22.210 --> 03:43:39.448]  So they use some sort of a rule in the city council, in the charter, to push forward this agenda to have these removed, calling them a nuisance after sitting there freely for a hundred years without any real problems or, you know, people
[03:43:41.354 --> 03:43:48.255]  Do you think that they're calling these a nuisance now because people keep getting triggered by them when they walk by?
[03:43:48.355 --> 03:43:51.096]  So is that why they're saying that they're a nuisance now?
[03:43:51.316 --> 03:43:52.776]  I think the potholes would be a bigger nuisance.
[03:43:53.136 --> 03:43:53.376]  Yeah.
[03:43:54.137 --> 03:44:03.618]  Wow, look, I've driven in this city for, you know, quite a few decades and yeah, the potholes are definitely a bigger nuisance, especially when you're repairing your vehicle.
[03:44:03.838 --> 03:44:06.339]  But the biggest issue is that they use this as a
[03:44:07.503 --> 03:44:23.477]  A way of utilizing a city ordinance to remove monuments that were part of our history that, you know, is from an era where these people, you know, were part of the Civil War and they were part of the South.
[03:44:23.517 --> 03:44:24.798]  You know, we are in the South.
[03:44:24.858 --> 03:44:25.899]  It's New Orleans, right?
[03:44:26.279 --> 03:44:30.143]  So we're in the South and it's New Orleans and, you know, these monuments to
[03:44:31.415 --> 03:44:31.956]  We're good.
[03:44:51.005 --> 03:44:51.886]  We're good to go.
[03:45:06.500 --> 03:45:13.607]  Malcolm Suber and his little small band of people who are not from New Orleans started this issue.
[03:45:14.248 --> 03:45:18.933]  They started tagging the monuments and they started writing, you know, racist slurs on them.
[03:45:19.313 --> 03:45:28.122]  And then right around the time when the election came up, that's when this whole Antifa movement, you know, started to erupt.
[03:45:28.742 --> 03:45:34.906]  And all these, you know, whether it's street kids or these college university kids from Tulane University.
[03:45:35.907 --> 03:45:44.112]  Some of my research has shown that that's where the Antifa is actually organizing as part of their indoctrination centers at our local university.
[03:45:44.532 --> 03:45:54.301]  At Tulane and so that's where they meet and organize and basically they were given free reign to terrorize the city.
[03:45:54.522 --> 03:46:07.214]  Mitch Landrieu wanted to make this or create this into an emergency situation so he allowed Antifa and take them down NOLA to run around lawless telling the New Orleans Police Department to stand down.
[03:46:07.874 --> 03:46:13.838]  And so over the past two years, you know, the monuments have been had graffiti on them.
[03:46:13.938 --> 03:46:18.061]  And we have an organization, a nonprofit organization for the past 30 years.
[03:46:18.401 --> 03:46:23.905]  They have been cleaning the monuments of the city because, I mean, it's a historic city and we have lots of monuments.
[03:46:23.925 --> 03:46:28.568]  We have monuments to Joan of Arc, Yenville, Jack, of course, Andrew Jackson.
[03:46:29.729 --> 03:46:35.333]  So now this whole taking down Nola Antifa group, they've kind of blended together.
[03:46:35.913 --> 03:46:37.394]  And what's going on is that
[03:46:38.715 --> 03:46:43.582]  George, this sounds like classic problem, reaction, solution.
[03:46:43.962 --> 03:46:52.192]  You got the city government that fuels these extremists, antifa, communist groups to go out and desecrate these statues.
[03:46:53.053 --> 03:46:58.359]  Then they claim the statues are a nuisance because Antifa's tagging them with graffiti and whatnot.
[03:46:58.759 --> 03:47:00.080]  So now they're calling for the removal.
[03:47:00.481 --> 03:47:10.290]  Here's the problem I have with this is that once you start pulling the string of history because you think some of it is bad, you unravel the whole tapestry that is the United States.
[03:47:10.891 --> 03:47:14.832]  You know, it's like, why would they stop at these statues?
[03:47:15.092 --> 03:47:18.234]  I mean, there's been so many bad things that have happened in U.S.
[03:47:18.274 --> 03:47:19.594]  history under the American flag.
[03:47:19.614 --> 03:47:21.455]  Why don't they just go out and ban the American flag?
[03:47:21.835 --> 03:47:23.115]  Well, they want to.
[03:47:23.175 --> 03:47:30.778]  They want to burn the American flag and we've even seen a lot of these, not even the Antifa, these SJWs calling for a ban of
[03:47:31.298 --> 03:47:38.087]  Of Columbus Day or Thanksgiving and a lot of different holidays that are really part of America's culture.
[03:47:38.948 --> 03:47:40.570]  I mean, that's what they want to do.
[03:47:40.610 --> 03:47:44.394]  They want to ban American culture to replace it with communism.
[03:47:45.362 --> 03:47:46.022]  Exactly.
[03:47:46.042 --> 03:47:48.843]  And it's not just Southern heritage or culture.
[03:47:49.243 --> 03:47:50.104]  It's Christian.
[03:47:50.224 --> 03:47:51.264]  It's American.
[03:47:51.404 --> 03:47:53.545]  It's colonialism.
[03:47:53.845 --> 03:47:56.386]  It's everything that makes America great.
[03:47:56.466 --> 03:47:58.867]  And so they want to take away all of that.
[03:47:58.887 --> 03:48:04.809]  And of course, there was an article that was presented to Congress back in 1963.
[03:48:04.849 --> 03:48:05.989]  And I've seen it on Rents.com.
[03:48:06.369 --> 03:48:08.130]  And it's basically the 45 declared goals
[03:48:10.931 --> 03:48:12.012]  Let's go one step further than that.
[03:48:12.032 --> 03:48:15.635]  It's not just the communists, it's these transnational elites that control the communists.
[03:48:15.695 --> 03:48:17.616]  It's all about destroying culture because
[03:48:35.851 --> 03:48:43.238]  People like, uh, you have nation-states, the strongest nation-states are, uh, bounded together by culture.
[03:48:43.658 --> 03:48:48.242]  You've seen this for thousands of years with Germans, the British culture, Indian culture, whatnot.
[03:48:49.263 --> 03:48:57.250]  And so, yeah, in order for them to destroy nation-states and put in their own ideology that runs contrary to American ideas, they have to destroy the culture.
[03:48:57.510 --> 03:49:01.494]  Of course, they're going to destroy the monuments, it's the first step to destroying culture is rewriting history.
[03:49:02.486 --> 03:49:03.006]  Well, I don't know.
[03:49:03.166 --> 03:49:10.692]  It's funny that you say that, too, kid, because about two weeks ago, George Soros was actually in town meeting with... That would surprise me.
[03:49:11.352 --> 03:49:12.793]  Yeah, with Mitch Landrieu.
[03:49:13.154 --> 03:49:20.579]  And there's also a thing called the Trilateral Commission, which David Brooks and Walter Isaacson has been a part of that.
[03:49:20.619 --> 03:49:23.061]  That's all part of the puppet masters behind all this.
[03:49:24.022 --> 03:49:36.800]  So what Antifa has been able to do over the past two years and specifically like right after the presidential election, they were given free reign in the city to run around and throw little hissy fits basically to
[03:49:38.184 --> 03:49:42.289]  They vandalized the city, put graffiti everywhere.
[03:49:42.349 --> 03:49:49.638]  They burned a tire on the front of the Confederate Museum, which is right near Lee Circle.
[03:49:50.839 --> 03:49:53.082]  The FBI had investigated that for arson.
[03:49:53.422 --> 03:49:55.885]  They broke windows out of Chase Bank on St.
[03:49:55.925 --> 03:49:56.566]  Charles Avenue.
[03:49:56.866 --> 03:49:57.868]  And here's the real kicker.
[03:49:58.188 --> 03:50:01.333]  The New Orleans Police Department was escorting them.
[03:50:01.793 --> 03:50:03.436]  They were not stopping them.
[03:50:03.716 --> 03:50:05.198]  They were escorting them.
[03:50:05.559 --> 03:50:07.261]  You know, I've been I'm a native of New Orleans.
[03:50:07.301 --> 03:50:08.243]  I've lived here all my life.
[03:50:08.283 --> 03:50:09.945]  You know what NOPD stands for?
[03:50:10.908 --> 03:50:11.769]  Not our problem.
[03:50:13.990 --> 03:50:18.093]  Except when it comes to taking your guns away during hurricanes, you know, that is their problem.
[03:50:18.114 --> 03:50:18.554]  Yeah.
[03:50:18.754 --> 03:50:30.383]  Well, we've seen this happen with Berkeley as well, where we've seen these stand down orders and the police just kind of, they stand by and watch, but they don't actually intervene when they see a crime taking place.
[03:50:30.423 --> 03:50:31.764]  And that's supposed to be their job.
[03:50:31.804 --> 03:50:32.925]  They're supposed to intervene.
[03:50:33.425 --> 03:50:44.093]  G. Edward Griffin said in the Capitalist Conspiracy, the documentary made in the 1960s, it's about the transnational elites would fund these leftist extremist groups.
[03:50:44.413 --> 03:50:51.739]  They're going to get into fights in the street, and then they're going to broadcast that to claim that, you know, we have to solve this chaos.
[03:50:52.500 --> 03:50:58.204]  So then they can create, you know, push in a police state, push in whatever government solution is to the government-created problem.
[03:50:59.192 --> 03:51:01.593]  So over the past two weeks, this is what has happened.
[03:51:01.633 --> 03:51:13.520]  First of all, a week ago Sunday, in the dark of night, Mitch Landrieu ordered the New Orleans Police Department to go to Liberty Monument, downtown New Orleans, to remove it.
[03:51:14.460 --> 03:51:18.002]  What they did was they sent out first canine dogs to clear the area.
[03:51:18.382 --> 03:51:20.843]  They set up snipers in the parking garage.
[03:51:21.144 --> 03:51:27.567]  Then they brought out a special task force to clear the area and put up barricades to keep people far enough back.
[03:51:28.047 --> 03:51:30.469]  Then came in the workers.
[03:51:30.869 --> 03:51:40.097]  Now, the workers were actually, and this is, follow this, they had cherry pickers, they had a flatbed truck, they had, you know, vehicles to move the cherry pickers back and forth.
[03:51:40.737 --> 03:51:45.161]  All of the markings on the vehicles were covered with masking tape.
[03:51:45.621 --> 03:51:55.070]  The DOT stickers, the brake tags, the license plates, the names of the businesses, everything was covered.
[03:51:56.672 --> 03:52:08.643]  Now, they came in and the workers had, and you can probably find some of those photos somewhere up in there, but the workers had masks on, balaclavas, they had bulletproof vests.
[03:52:08.703 --> 03:52:09.504]  It's like Antifa!
[03:52:09.764 --> 03:52:19.610]  And they had ballistic helmets and Mitch Landrieu, you know, he's a typical left-wing politician.
[03:52:19.650 --> 03:52:21.611]  This is his optics, okay?
[03:52:21.952 --> 03:52:35.340]  This was all theater for him because he's been saying for the past few weeks that the people who are supporting the monuments have been making threats and they're violent and blah blah blah.
[03:52:35.700 --> 03:52:40.144]  You know, we're a bunch of law-abiding, peaceful, historic preservationists.
[03:52:40.644 --> 03:52:53.414]  But he's trying to make this, paint this picture for the media, and he's been, you know, going on to MSNBC and CNN and all these, you know, mainstream media, liberal media outlets, you know, making himself into this, you know, great...
[03:52:55.255 --> 03:53:10.320]  Well, George, you were talking to me a little bit about how there was a rally and how the police stood down and you had like 30 people out there trying to protect one of these statues and you had this mob of Antifa.
[03:53:10.340 --> 03:53:11.340]  Can you tell us about that?
[03:53:12.264 --> 03:53:20.727]  Well, what happened is since the Liberty Monument removal, we've had people, monument watchers, monument guards, you know, supporters who have actually come.
[03:53:21.208 --> 03:53:27.910]  And we've had people like Arlene Barnum and Andrew Duncan, who's known as the Black Rebel, Confederate supporters.
[03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:33.232]  We've had, you know, people who are from the Sons of Confederate Veterans and flaggers.
[03:53:33.252 --> 03:53:39.635]  We've had people who are part of the militias and bikers and just, you know, average citizens, you know, who have spent
[03:53:40.433 --> 03:53:42.436]  Time their own personal time.
[03:53:42.456 --> 03:53:53.251]  24 hours a day sitting at these monuments, watching Beauregard, Jefferson, Davidson, Lee, and trying to keep the Antifa from vandalizing them.
[03:53:53.552 --> 03:53:55.775]  So we've been standing there, standing guard,
[03:53:56.295 --> 03:54:00.279]  And it's come to a point where people are actually because Louisiana is an open carry state.
[03:54:00.519 --> 03:54:05.444]  We're standing guard with, you know, pistols and sidearms and even with long rifles.
[03:54:05.884 --> 03:54:13.071]  And we're just standing there and we're peacefully, you know, polite and cordial, informative, talking to people that come by us and what's going on.
[03:54:13.131 --> 03:54:15.353]  And we're just telling them a little bit about history and such.
[03:54:16.114 --> 03:54:16.895]  And, you know, so
[03:54:18.186 --> 03:54:20.830]  That's been going on basically, and people have been bringing supplies.
[03:54:20.850 --> 03:54:22.312]  So that's been going on for about a week now.
[03:54:22.332 --> 03:54:31.824]  Now, Saturday, Antifa came with a big yacht, large banner, and they were, I guess, kind of testing the waters, but they were trying to provoke us.
[03:54:31.884 --> 03:54:36.270]  And they were doing their little chant, take them down, take them down, and we're just standing back.
[03:54:36.790 --> 03:54:38.151]  We looked at them like they were stupid.
[03:54:38.511 --> 03:54:41.794]  And then, you know, they were trying to, you know, instigate with us.
[03:54:41.854 --> 03:54:49.099]  Well, George, you know, we are running out of time, so if there's anything you want to say, you know, in the next, like, 30 seconds.
[03:54:49.779 --> 03:54:50.920]  Monday was May Day.
[03:54:50.960 --> 03:54:51.861]  They came at us.
[03:54:52.241 --> 03:54:54.763]  They had 300 of those against 30 of us.
[03:54:55.063 --> 03:55:05.410]  We stood our grounds, and basically they came in with, yeah, there it is, the assault vehicle, where they brought in another 50 people, and it was mayhem.
[03:55:05.430 --> 03:55:06.251]  Then they pepped us.
[03:55:06.271 --> 03:55:07.913]  Pepper spray a little girl in the face?
[03:55:08.014 --> 03:55:10.737]  They pepper sprayed a little five-year-old?
[03:55:10.797 --> 03:55:13.261]  They actually assaulted a lady in a wheelchair.
[03:55:13.281 --> 03:55:15.925]  And New Orleans Police Department stood down.
[03:55:15.965 --> 03:55:19.270]  They didn't do anything until the news cameras rolled up.
[03:55:19.310 --> 03:55:22.975]  And when the news cameras rolled up, that's when the police department decided to take action.
[03:55:23.055 --> 03:55:23.335]  Of course.
[03:55:23.456 --> 03:55:25.218]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[03:55:25.638 --> 03:55:27.120]  We appreciate your time, George.
[03:55:27.140 --> 03:55:28.101]  Thank you.
[03:55:28.141 --> 03:55:29.343]  Thank you so much, George.
[03:55:29.383 --> 03:55:30.464]  We appreciate it.
[03:55:30.524 --> 03:55:40.156]  And everyone out there, make sure you guys stay tuned because there will be an event out there coming up very soon to protect another one of those statues.
[03:55:40.617 --> 03:55:42.259]  So what do you think about some of this kit, Daniels?
[03:55:42.748 --> 03:55:44.870]  Yeah, it's just, it's the same thing over and over again.
[03:55:44.890 --> 03:55:47.772]  That's been the theme for the past hour and a half that we've been talking about.
[03:55:48.112 --> 03:55:52.055]  Organized crime, networking, problem reaction solution.
[03:55:52.195 --> 03:56:01.842]  That's right, and these communists, they want to destroy American culture, they want to destroy our heritage, they want to destroy everything in the name of political correctness, so that's why
[03:56:02.262 --> 03:56:07.744]  You know, it's important that you guys out there support us because we are listener-supported.
[03:56:08.044 --> 03:56:09.164]  It's because of you.
[03:56:09.565 --> 03:56:17.287]  You guys are the ones who support us, not these big George Soros, big billionaires that support these mainstream media outlets.
[03:56:17.767 --> 03:56:27.511]  So, I just want to say, guys... Yeah, you can resist a controlled narrative with the free market ideas, just like we were saying about the whole millennial thing.
[03:56:28.231 --> 03:56:29.032]  That's how you do it.
[03:56:29.192 --> 03:56:31.774]  You know, free market of products, free market of ideas.
[03:56:31.894 --> 03:56:32.314]  That's right.
[03:56:32.334 --> 03:56:32.975]  Free marketing.
[03:56:33.015 --> 03:56:35.156]  Get some of our amazing Secret B12.
[03:56:36.117 --> 03:56:38.239]  And you know, it tastes great and does great.
[03:56:38.279 --> 03:56:44.703]  So we are actually going to be sending you guys over to Rob Dew and Darren McBreen.
[03:56:45.064 --> 03:56:47.005]  So they have some pretty interesting stuff.
[03:56:47.045 --> 03:56:48.206]  So stay tuned, guys.
[03:56:48.727 --> 03:56:50.388]  They will be back after the break.
[03:57:01.004 --> 03:57:03.085]  Tasting multivitamin formula available.

[03:57:53.012 --> 03:57:58.318]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:57:58.498 --> 03:57:59.078]  I take this.
[03:57:59.339 --> 03:58:00.360]  My family takes this.
[03:58:00.460 --> 03:58:04.684]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:58:04.744 --> 03:58:08.969]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:58:09.329 --> 03:58:13.891]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:58:13.951 --> 03:58:15.012]  I don't feel good.
[03:58:15.092 --> 03:58:18.593]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:58:18.613 --> 03:58:21.495]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:58:21.535 --> 03:58:26.837]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:58:27.337 --> 03:58:29.758]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:58:30.299 --> 03:58:30.879]  And I know my hips.
