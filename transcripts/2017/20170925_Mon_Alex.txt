[00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.933]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:27.255]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.255 --> 00:00:40.480]  Well, the press asked the president what he thought of his supposed friend, the owner of the New England Patriots, saying that the president's doing the wrong thing standing up for the American flag and for our veterans and for this country.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.843]  And Trump said, well, he's allowed to have his own opinion if he wants to, and did flip him the bird.
[00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:50.525]  That's why I like Trump telling it like it is.
[00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:52.426]  If they can break our will, they win.
[00:00:52.426 --> 00:00:54.166]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:58.568]  Nationwide, Americans are burning NFL ticket shirts in solidarity with Trump.
[00:00:58.568 --> 00:00:59.949]  This is a real info war.
[00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.790]  We're going to break their will, not ours.
[00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.633]  We're going to kick the globalists out of this country and off this planet.
[00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:12.655]  John Bowne has an excellent report boiling this down, and I'll be back with the main transmission.
[00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:13.655]  It's a little frustrating, man.
[00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:22.134]  Because this guy that we've put in charge has tried to divide us once again.
[00:01:22.134 --> 00:01:26.517]  You know, that's just something I can't stand for, man.
[00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:29.479]  It's in the WikiLeaks that it's Soros, you dumbass!
[00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.801]  You know, all these people are speaking up.
[00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:32.781]  Spoiled rotten brat.
[00:01:32.781 --> 00:01:34.142]  It's for the greater cause.
[00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:36.104]  Call LeBron James a superstar.
[00:01:36.104 --> 00:01:36.984]  He's a super punk.
[00:01:38.126 --> 00:01:41.971]  Calling our president a bum, another narcissistic mental patient.
[00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:48.801]  These are nothing but paid shills of the very same criminal dirtbag combine.
[00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:51.274]  That owns Hollywood.
[00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:52.835]  And their power is waning.
[00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:57.798]  And they know they don't have that firm grip around America's neck anymore.
[00:01:57.798 --> 00:02:03.142]  And they've pushed total race war, funded by that piece of garbage George Soros.
[00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:04.463]  And that hadn't worked.
[00:02:04.463 --> 00:02:07.905]  So they're going full tilt right now.
[00:02:07.905 --> 00:02:11.808]  They are balls to the walls!
[00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:14.650]  In an attempt to bully us back into submission.
[00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.732]  Of course, you know the famous saying, love it or leave it.
[00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:27.220]  And I know the American flag's been used for some wars that were wrong and has been used for even globalist operations.
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:40.604]  But now the very globalists themselves are trying to get rid of the American flag and the Bill of Rights and Constitution so we hate our own culture and accept globalism that is designed to be evil.
[00:02:40.604 --> 00:02:45.486]  America was the idea of freedom and just that idea changed the world.
[00:02:45.486 --> 00:02:46.546]  We were exceptional.
[00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:50.740]  We did produce the greatest freedom.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.593]  We did develop the ideas of the West and science and technology and open free societies, something nobody else did.
[00:02:57.864 --> 00:03:17.340]  And now the globalists use our strength, our goodness, our altruism, our openness against us, knowing we have a conscience to bully us into submission, to blackmail us, to attack us, until there's no end to what we won't give in to once we start bowing, once we start stepping, once we start fetching.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.782]  When they say jump, we say how high.
[00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:22.925]  And it just shows you how desperate they are.
[00:03:24.758 --> 00:03:27.262]  To maintain control over the American people.
[00:03:27.262 --> 00:03:38.859]  The basic philosophy between the so-called extreme left people and communists and socialists and the so-called philosophy on the right of the fascists and the Nazis was really the same.
[00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:40.883]  How can this be?
[00:03:40.883 --> 00:03:43.505]  They're supposed to be opposites of each other.
[00:03:43.505 --> 00:03:52.049]  And then I began to realize that there is something more common to all of these philosophies that was left out of my training and education.
[00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.290]  And that was the ideology of collectivism.
[00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.373]  I began to realize that the thing that was common to them all is something called collectivism.
[00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:02.574]  Now that's a word that is not very well used.
[00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:03.175]  It's not very
[00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:12.457]  Entrenched in the vocabulary of most people today, but I found out that it was a very commonly used word about a century ago.
[00:04:12.457 --> 00:04:16.758]  People wrote a lot about collectivism and the opposite of that would be individualism.
[00:04:16.758 --> 00:04:23.860]  Those are two words that are sort of abandoned today, but in my view, I think they need to be recaptured and understood and used more.
[00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:29.662]  The NFL equals everything that hates America.
[00:04:29.662 --> 00:04:33.284]  The NFL is a disgusting, spoiled, rotten group.
[00:04:33.284 --> 00:04:42.208]  From the degenerate owners, to the coaches, to the players, to all the filth that watches it and loves it and gives away their life.
[00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:44.829]  I told you 20 years ago the NFL was pure propaganda.
[00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:49.131]  Now it's all anti-gun, all anti-family, all anti-Christian with the ads.
[00:04:49.131 --> 00:04:51.272]  They won't even accept ads that aren't.
[00:04:51.272 --> 00:04:54.654]  And it's all just a weapon to destroy this country.
[00:04:56.394 --> 00:04:57.805]  We'll be back with the full transmission.
[00:04:57.805 --> 00:04:58.248]  Spread the word.
[00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:14.487]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[00:05:14.487 --> 00:05:18.770]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.332]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[00:05:21.332 --> 00:05:23.533]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:29.057]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles?
[00:05:29.437 --> 00:05:30.657]  And to profit from it.
[00:05:30.657 --> 00:05:35.378]  What kind of leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[00:05:35.378 --> 00:05:39.699]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.180]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.181]  Adams also said, liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.521]  Join the InfoWars.
[00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:49.822]  Spread the information.

[00:08:09.233 --> 00:08:13.575]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:08:13.575 --> 00:08:16.297]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:24.301]  What a time that we live in, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:36.428 --> 00:09:01.768]  Where the president is universally criticized in mainstream corporate media across the board for daring to say you disrespect our veterans, you disrespect our country, you disrespect our sovereignty, you disrespect yourselves when you
[00:09:04.162 --> 00:09:14.550]  Kneel for the National Anthem or join hands together like you're a bunch of thumb-sucking babies in a big publicity stunt?
[00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:21.114]  So that you can virtue-signal the world how good you are and how you stand against America?
[00:09:21.114 --> 00:09:26.578]  And then you go to a foreign country!
[00:09:26.578 --> 00:09:27.479]  Even more incredible!
[00:09:29.144 --> 00:09:34.187]  The entire Ravens and Jaguar squads kneel for the U.S.
[00:09:34.187 --> 00:09:48.275]  National Anthem along with the coaches, the staff, all the scum, but stand, and some of them even put their hands over their heart, for God save the Queen.
[00:09:48.275 --> 00:09:50.356]  God save our Queen!
[00:09:52.912 --> 00:10:09.355]  When the Star-Spangled Banner and the National Anthem, which is just one verse of it, is about all the wars we had with the British, the Canadians, which were the French at the time, the traitors, all the rest of it.
[00:10:09.355 --> 00:10:17.077]  It's a story about our wars in that early time.
[00:10:17.077 --> 00:10:21.278]  And they go to a foreign country and they're so ignorant and so stupid
[00:10:22.193 --> 00:10:29.037]  That they're following a corporate program that began six years ago with the concussion controversy.
[00:10:29.037 --> 00:10:45.246]  And I said at the time that the Justice Department, the criminal investigations, you're going to see the NFL go from being pro-America, at least on the surface, and pro-free market and capitalist, to being openly anti-American, anti-family, anti-God, anti-gun.
[00:10:45.246 --> 00:10:47.187]  And now it's all of it.
[00:10:47.187 --> 00:10:49.148]  They won't even take conservative ads.
[00:10:50.515 --> 00:10:57.461]  Games that air on Father's Day will have up to six different ads, sometimes back-to-back.
[00:10:57.461 --> 00:10:59.603]  I saw one with four ads back-to-back.
[00:10:59.603 --> 00:11:00.805]  We covered it a few years ago.
[00:11:00.805 --> 00:11:10.614]  You want to watch the ads, just backlash against Anti-Father's Day ads.
[00:11:10.614 --> 00:11:11.855]  And you say, why'd they do that?
[00:11:11.855 --> 00:11:12.956]  Because it's thematic.
[00:11:14.209 --> 00:11:22.151]  Just like we know from GamerGate, you've got the big executives of the video game companies getting together and directing what everybody's going to do politically.
[00:11:22.151 --> 00:11:25.792]  And it's the same thing with Hollywood, and the same thing with the NFL.
[00:11:25.792 --> 00:11:31.393]  All this is the big entertainment industry that is the mouthpiece of the globalists.
[00:11:31.393 --> 00:11:41.296]  So when you hear something out of the NFL, or you hear something out of these roided-up puppets on the field, you're hearing the mouth of Sauron
[00:11:43.763 --> 00:11:46.064]  You're hearing the mouth of Hitler!
[00:11:46.064 --> 00:11:47.804]  You're hearing the mouth of ISIS!
[00:11:47.804 --> 00:12:04.528]  You're hearing the mouth of George Soros, the mouth of the Federal Reserve, the mouth of the tax-exempt megacorporations that own literal slave factories all over the world, when they could pay their people just a dollar an hour more, and they would be living a lot better.
[00:12:04.528 --> 00:12:11.130]  And it would build up markets in China, and markets in Mexico, and markets in all these countries where they're exploiting labor.
[00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.330]  Mexico's nothing compared to China.
[00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:14.095]  But they don't want that.
[00:12:14.095 --> 00:12:15.656]  They want to keep you poor.
[00:12:15.656 --> 00:12:17.518]  They're teaching you austerity's good.
[00:12:17.518 --> 00:12:26.287]  They're telling Africans you can't have cars, you can't have air conditioning, you can't have a nice house, or you'll burn the planet up, close quote.
[00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:34.756]  But it's okay to have a black man tell black people you can't have industry, you can't have industrialization, you can't have civilization!
[00:12:36.175 --> 00:12:53.265]  Like Obama's some space alien landing in his big, giant airplane with dozens of other aircraft and a thousand-person detail, over 300 Secret Service agents, landing like a Roman god!
[00:12:53.265 --> 00:12:55.546]  And then telling them, you're savages!
[00:12:55.546 --> 00:12:56.887]  You don't get nothing!
[00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:06.214]  You don't get anything as if we don't have cleaner technology, as if civilization isn't good.
[00:13:06.214 --> 00:13:15.140]  Just the most outrageous crap being shoveled directly at these exploiters.
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:26.788]  And then here comes a president trying to turn the economy on, trying to get everybody jobs back, trying to get those wages up, trying to stabilize health care, trying to kick out the huge hordes of criminals that are in the country.
[00:13:28.365 --> 00:13:44.838]  And he's the bad guy because the President daresay, if there's somebody out there on that field during that National Anthem and they want to take a knee and be disrespectful of our veterans and everybody else, get that son of a bitch out of there and say, you're fired!
[00:13:44.838 --> 00:13:45.899]  You know why they're so scared of Trump?
[00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:49.762]  Because that's pure truth.
[00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:52.624]  They misrepresented everything he ever said and everything he ever did.
[00:13:55.103 --> 00:13:56.204]  I'll play that clip again in a moment.
[00:14:13.925 --> 00:14:17.229]  Desecrate the flag and America in front of everyone.
[00:14:17.229 --> 00:14:25.257]  And you knew it was going to happen on Saturday when the Commissioner of the NFL said, no, they're not disrespecting the flag.
[00:14:25.257 --> 00:14:30.603]  He said, quote, you are disrespecting the NFL.
[00:14:30.603 --> 00:14:33.105]  They believe you have no culture left.
[00:14:33.726 --> 00:14:36.628]  The only culture we had left was the NFL.
[00:14:36.628 --> 00:14:40.590]  It was one of the only places that had any Americana left in it.
[00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:42.251]  It was a symbol of America.
[00:14:42.251 --> 00:14:50.075]  And it was captured via the blackmail over the concussion situation with the Justice Department.
[00:14:50.075 --> 00:14:51.176]  And now it's being gelded.
[00:14:53.749 --> 00:15:01.834]  And now it's being turned into a wimp sport, just as Trump said, and they're now under the control, scared, bullied by the Justice Department, because they made a deal.
[00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:02.955]  They're just the owners.
[00:15:02.955 --> 00:15:04.336]  They just want their profits.
[00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:08.198]  But now you're facing the American people, and now you will be destroyed.
[00:15:08.198 --> 00:15:14.022]  I predict the NFL is as popular as national baseball within three years.
[00:15:14.022 --> 00:15:15.463]  There's no reversing this.
[00:15:15.463 --> 00:15:19.625]  The downward trend is complete.
[00:15:19.625 --> 00:15:21.366]  The magic's over.
[00:15:21.366 --> 00:15:21.967]  It's gone.
[00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:31.697]  Because one way the NFL got its allure was talking about veterans and having troops there and talking about heroes over the decades.
[00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:39.685]  And so that gave them the allure of the nation's warriors when they're the nation's spoiled rotten roidheads.
[00:15:39.685 --> 00:15:41.227]  When they're the nation's scum.
[00:15:45.225 --> 00:15:48.369]  And so, you wanna talk about jumping the Megalodon shark?
[00:15:48.369 --> 00:15:52.915]  They just did it, and there's no putting it back together again.
[00:15:52.915 --> 00:15:54.196]  Never!
[00:15:54.196 --> 00:16:00.884]  Oh, and I love LeBron James opening his stupid, dumb, uh, you know, moron mouth as well.
[00:16:02.785 --> 00:16:05.486]  I just love watching the coaches do it.
[00:16:05.486 --> 00:16:06.086]  I love it.
[00:16:06.086 --> 00:16:08.567]  Keep digging that hole.
[00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:11.208]  Let me give you as much rope as I can.
[00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:14.569]  Never interrupt your enemies when they're destroying themselves.
[00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:15.950]  Never, never.
[00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.111]  Good, good, good.
[00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:29.614]  You arrogant, narcissistic, mile-wide, inch-deep, social justice warriors signaling trash.
[00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:31.195]  If you had the players saying they're kneeling,
[00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:37.863]  During the anthem to pray for all the dead black children that were aborted, 51%.
[00:16:37.863 --> 00:16:42.226]  Then I'd say, oh, that's a way to get a lot of attention and still honor the flag and put your hand over your heart or something like that.
[00:16:42.226 --> 00:16:42.726]  No, no, no.
[00:16:42.726 --> 00:16:44.728]  It's not over anything real.
[00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:53.932]  It's a bunch of empty, hype-driven people that sit there and watch TV all day and watch ESPN with its plunging ratings.
[00:16:53.932 --> 00:17:05.016]  I love how when CNN and MSNBC and all them lost their ratings, 95% of their ratings, turning into total disinformation outlets the last decade, that ESPN became the new mouthpiece of propaganda.
[00:17:06.601 --> 00:17:08.242]  And then now it's ratings are plunging.
[00:17:08.242 --> 00:17:10.503]  And then the NFL goes, we'll do it ourselves.
[00:17:10.503 --> 00:17:13.144]  We'll bully America back into submission.
[00:17:13.144 --> 00:17:18.887]  Here, let's have everybody kneel or stay inside of the field house.
[00:17:18.887 --> 00:17:21.348]  Stay inside the locker rooms while they do this.
[00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:21.809]  You know what?
[00:17:21.809 --> 00:17:23.309]  Everyone is done.
[00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:25.471]  No one's watching you again.
[00:17:25.471 --> 00:17:26.631]  It's over.
[00:17:26.631 --> 00:17:29.633]  You have given us the catalyst to destroy you.
[00:17:30.453 --> 00:17:32.234]  I mean, everybody knows I don't just hide stuff.
[00:17:32.234 --> 00:17:33.956]  When my gut knows, it knows.
[00:17:33.956 --> 00:17:35.317]  You're done!
[00:17:35.317 --> 00:17:37.839]  This is beautiful!
[00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:38.939]  Devastating victory!
[00:17:38.939 --> 00:17:41.802]  And by the way, Trump lured you in.
[00:17:41.802 --> 00:17:44.804]  That's why he said it's not even the same game anymore.
[00:17:44.804 --> 00:17:45.885]  He knew it's been captured.
[00:17:47.116 --> 00:17:48.356]  And he was killing it.
[00:17:48.356 --> 00:17:50.217]  He was putting it out of its misery.
[00:17:50.217 --> 00:17:51.757]  And you took the bait.
[00:17:51.757 --> 00:17:53.877]  Because you're not just fighting Trump now.
[00:17:53.877 --> 00:17:57.698]  You made it about America and the flag, which was your next target.
[00:17:57.698 --> 00:17:58.278]  And Trump knew it.
[00:17:58.278 --> 00:18:02.139]  It's like he said, soon they're going to want to ban George Washington statues at Thomas Jefferson.
[00:18:02.139 --> 00:18:05.580]  One week later, the Democrats all came out and said it!
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.580]  And guess what the new talking point is?
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.581]  They're now saying, and I have the clips coming up,
[00:18:11.676 --> 00:18:18.099]  They're now saying, ladies and gentlemen, that, quote, the national anthem is white supremacist.
[00:18:18.099 --> 00:18:20.820]  NBC.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:26.743]  And I've got all these others, and they're now saying, get rid of the flag, and they're now saying,
[00:18:28.038 --> 00:18:29.099]  Get rid of all of it.
[00:18:29.099 --> 00:18:31.501]  See, America itself is bad.
[00:18:31.501 --> 00:18:43.733]  This is the full globalist attack trying to make a bunch of weak-minded people that want to live here and exploit the country and get filthy rich and suck their thumbs while they get exploited and end up destroying their own paychecks.
[00:18:47.293 --> 00:18:49.615]  It's like folks that wanted communism in Venezuela.
[00:18:49.615 --> 00:18:54.859]  They don't even know 20 years later why they all don't have power and there's no food and they're out on the streets on their butts.
[00:18:54.859 --> 00:18:59.203]  They're still bitching, wanting more socialism, thinking if you cry harder you get something.
[00:18:59.203 --> 00:19:00.384]  It'll be the same thing here.
[00:19:00.384 --> 00:19:09.271]  All these NFL guys are going to wonder, within three years, they're already having to renegotiate contracts because the money's gone, within three years they're going to be making half of what they were!
[00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:10.772]  Ha ha, yeah!
[00:19:11.432 --> 00:19:12.153]  Yeah!
[00:19:12.153 --> 00:19:13.053]  Good!
[00:19:13.053 --> 00:19:13.574]  Good!
[00:19:13.574 --> 00:19:15.135]  You're gonna hurt America!
[00:19:15.135 --> 00:19:15.995]  You wanna flush it down?
[00:19:15.995 --> 00:19:17.416]  You wanna flush the prosperity down?
[00:19:17.416 --> 00:19:21.218]  You wanna work for a real Nazi collaborator that came up with all this?
[00:19:21.218 --> 00:19:22.379]  You dumbasses!
[00:19:22.379 --> 00:19:23.760]  Excuse me, I'm gonna stop.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:32.525]  Folks, I've gotten so mad the last few... I just... I am just done, because... It's the scum running this, and then the idiots that follow it.
[00:19:32.525 --> 00:19:33.826]  It's so transparent.
[00:19:33.826 --> 00:19:36.167]  It's so insane.
[00:19:36.167 --> 00:19:37.408]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:19:37.408 --> 00:19:38.209]  Here in about 20 seconds.
[00:19:39.588 --> 00:19:42.452]  And when we come back, I'm going to go to the Trump clips.
[00:19:42.452 --> 00:19:44.014]  Folks are boycotting the NFL everywhere.
[00:19:44.014 --> 00:19:45.375]  DrugsReport.com.
[00:19:45.375 --> 00:19:49.981]  DrugsReport.com is linked to our big story by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:55.127]  Americans nationwide burn NFL ticket shirts with solidarity with Trump.
[00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:57.010]  NFL equals Hollywood elite.
[00:19:58.846 --> 00:20:03.587]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[00:20:03.587 --> 00:20:09.288]  Become part of a group of self-paid patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[00:20:09.288 --> 00:20:10.928]  Individual share amounts begin at $107.

[00:20:11.268 --> 00:20:11.348]  Yes.
[00:20:11.348 --> 00:20:19.470]  I wasn't talking to you, so I used our outros.
[00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:20.170]  Uh, sure.
[00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:25.691]  Scott left me a note saying leave it down and then bring it up, but I can have it up if you'd like.
[00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:27.431]  Yeah, do outros normal.

[00:24:16.022 --> 00:24:25.468]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24:25.468 --> 00:24:34.034]  You know, you got this attack at the church this weekend, killing a bunch of people, and it was an Islamicist migrant, refugee of course, that did it.
[00:24:34.034 --> 00:24:35.916]  That'll get no coverage.
[00:24:35.916 --> 00:24:39.138]  Another black guy killing a bunch of white people.
[00:24:39.138 --> 00:24:42.180]  Because white people are evil, and MSNBC says they deserve to die.
[00:24:43.356 --> 00:24:59.470]  And you get one moron, idiot, racist white guy in South Carolina, goes in and shoots and kills nine people at a church, and it's the end of the world and all white people are guilty and are the devil.
[00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:00.610]  No!
[00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:06.455]  All black people aren't murdering racists because some black racist Muslim went and killed people.
[00:25:06.455 --> 00:25:08.557]  It's the ideology.
[00:25:08.557 --> 00:25:10.579]  Just like it's the ideology with the white idiot.
[00:25:13.629 --> 00:25:23.214]  I mean, look at this moron report suspect in Tennessee church killing a pro-Islamist black power Sudanese migrant.
[00:25:23.214 --> 00:25:31.679]  And he got wound up by the media and went to a church that had white people at it and he killed a bunch of them dead in a hammer.
[00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:34.100]  But you'll never learn their names.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.641]  You'll never hear about them by tomorrow.
[00:25:37.346 --> 00:25:45.484]  Because it's just another murderous, racist, crazy, black, islamicist going out to KILL SOME BLACK DEVILS!
[00:25:46.667 --> 00:25:54.088]  You aren't going to see the NFL jerks, the coaches, the team members, you're not going to see them taking a knee.
[00:25:54.088 --> 00:25:55.709]  No, no, no, no.
[00:25:55.709 --> 00:26:05.011]  Because MSNBC and President Obama and the rest of the media, while we all know it's the white people, Hillary said, racist white people didn't elect me.
[00:26:05.011 --> 00:26:11.552]  Really the same ones that voted for Trump is the very same group that ended up putting Obama in.
[00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:21.307]  The church shooting spree was stopped by an usher with a gun, though.
[00:26:21.307 --> 00:26:23.412]  Oh!
[00:26:23.412 --> 00:26:24.073]  Oh, and it was a...
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.281]  Woman reportedly did it?
[00:26:27.281 --> 00:26:28.782]  Yeah, you'll probably never hear about that.
[00:26:28.782 --> 00:26:35.727]  But again, you get another Islamic attack from a Sudanese invader, an Islamic invader.
[00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:38.469]  You know Sudan didn't used to be Muslim.
[00:26:38.469 --> 00:26:45.775]  It's just turned Muslim the last 30 years because the Muslims have 4 to 1 ratio what black Christians have.
[00:26:46.954 --> 00:27:03.907]  Because it's the Islamic religion to have a bunch of kids to take over and they've been invading for the last 30 years Sudan and have taken half the country and are murdering every black person they get their hands on above the age of six or seven and they take everybody else back and brainwash them.
[00:27:07.546 --> 00:27:13.072]  Islam is the largest religion in Sudan, and Muslims have dominated national government institutions since independence in 1956.
[00:27:13.072 --> 00:27:20.780]  According to the UNDP, in Sudan, the Muslim population is 97%, including numerous Arab and non-Arab groups.
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.805]  The remaining 3% ascribe to their Christianity or traditional animist religions.
[00:27:26.681 --> 00:27:29.643]  And if you go back, it was a Christian country, but it's been a major invasion.
[00:27:29.643 --> 00:27:31.464]  That's Wikipedia right there.
[00:27:31.464 --> 00:27:33.065]  None of that's accurate, by the way.
[00:27:33.065 --> 00:27:33.885]  Wikipedia is accurate.
[00:27:33.885 --> 00:27:34.866]  Sometimes, other times, it's not.
[00:27:34.866 --> 00:27:40.389]  So that's probably written by the Sudanese government themselves.
[00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:42.270]  Look into the Sudanese Civil War.
[00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:47.914]  The point is, is it's another Muslim going and killing people.
[00:27:47.914 --> 00:27:50.055]  You're not going to hear anything about that, because they're white.
[00:27:50.055 --> 00:27:51.956]  They deserved it!
[00:27:51.956 --> 00:27:53.277]  They were white devils!
[00:27:55.512 --> 00:27:58.475]  And I say you kill the white women and the white children!
[00:27:58.475 --> 00:28:02.418]  And you say, why kill the beautiful little blonde-haired, blue-eyed babies?
[00:28:02.418 --> 00:28:03.679]  And why kill the mothers?
[00:28:03.679 --> 00:28:09.464]  Because every nine months, the white woman gets on her back, and military enforcements roll out!
[00:28:09.464 --> 00:28:12.346]  So I say, God damn it, kill them all!
[00:28:12.346 --> 00:28:23.415]  Excuse me, taking the Lord's name in vain, but I was quoting for documentary purposes, Khalid Mohammed, the leader of the New Black Panther Party.
[00:28:24.241 --> 00:28:27.842]  Saying I say kill those white babies!
[00:28:27.842 --> 00:28:29.182]  And you kill them all!
[00:28:29.182 --> 00:28:30.783]  You kill the babies!
[00:28:30.783 --> 00:28:33.203]  You kill the women!
[00:28:33.203 --> 00:28:36.604]  I said you kill them all!
[00:28:36.604 --> 00:28:42.866]  Let God sort it out!
[00:28:42.866 --> 00:28:44.447]  What you wanna bet?
[00:28:44.447 --> 00:28:52.389]  This guy... Walking into that church trying to kill as many white devils as he could.
[00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:53.269]  What you wanna bet?
[00:28:54.465 --> 00:29:00.147]  He liked to listen to Mr. Muhammad.
[00:29:00.147 --> 00:29:01.568]  Look at this guy.
[00:29:01.568 --> 00:29:03.169]  The arrogance.
[00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:06.290]  The hatred.
[00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:08.411]  The enjoyment.
[00:29:08.411 --> 00:29:09.731]  Oh, and too bad.
[00:29:09.731 --> 00:29:13.953]  Probably would have killed everybody in there, but oh ho ho ho!
[00:29:13.953 --> 00:29:16.294]  We're not under an Islamic rule like you are.
[00:29:16.294 --> 00:29:18.295]  We're allowed to have guns.
[00:29:18.295 --> 00:29:21.076]  Didn't go too well, did it, racist scum?
[00:29:23.666 --> 00:29:24.987]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:29:24.987 --> 00:29:29.071]  Everybody wants to hate on America, but they just can't wait to get here.
[00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:35.517]  They just can't wait to get here and then run the free market system that made it so great into the ground.
[00:29:35.517 --> 00:29:36.438]  And they know our weakness.
[00:29:36.438 --> 00:29:39.100]  They know that we are open, loving, Christian people.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.804]  So they try to bully us with all this political correctness into submission.
[00:29:42.804 --> 00:29:46.167]  And the NFL, the globalists, and all the rest of them have gone too far.
[00:29:47.679 --> 00:29:51.629]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.629 --> 00:29:54.295]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.741 --> 00:30:06.726]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[00:30:06.726 --> 00:30:12.230]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.572]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[00:30:15.572 --> 00:30:17.933]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[00:30:17.933 --> 00:30:23.257]  And how do we remove that power from Washington, to our local communities, to the individual?
[00:30:23.257 --> 00:30:25.118]  That is the ultimate concern.
[00:30:25.118 --> 00:30:27.380]  The concentration of power, the excess of power,
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.263]  It was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[00:30:31.263 --> 00:30:33.745]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[00:30:33.745 --> 00:30:38.069]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[00:30:38.069 --> 00:30:42.813]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[00:30:42.813 --> 00:30:48.198]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[00:30:48.198 --> 00:30:53.242]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[00:30:53.542 --> 00:30:57.255]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[00:30:57.255 --> 00:30:59.101]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:30:59.932 --> 00:31:01.813]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:31:01.813 --> 00:31:03.834]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:31:03.834 --> 00:31:06.736]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:31:06.736 --> 00:31:12.819]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:31:12.819 --> 00:31:22.004]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:31:22.004 --> 00:31:25.286]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,

[00:31:29.533 --> 00:31:37.566]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:31:37.566 --> 00:31:38.647]  The general public doesn't.
[00:31:39.742 --> 00:31:43.685]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:31:43.685 --> 00:31:47.248]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:31:47.248 --> 00:31:53.953]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:31:53.953 --> 00:31:58.116]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:20.275]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:20.275 --> 00:33:29.544]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:29.544 --> 00:33:39.853]  So here is the statement that got all the big controversy going after three years of Kaepernick and all the other spoiled rotten babies.
[00:33:41.198 --> 00:33:52.361]  And all their Black Lives Matter and all their globalist propaganda trying to create racial division in this country that the WikiLeaks documents admit is to control the public and keep us fighting with each other.
[00:33:52.361 --> 00:34:00.943]  I mean, it's not my opinion that they're taking issues that comparatively are tiny compared to real issues.
[00:34:00.943 --> 00:34:06.445]  A couple hundred black people a year may get killed improperly by police.
[00:34:06.445 --> 00:34:10.006]  And as Stalin said, one man is a tragedy, ten thousand is a statistic.
[00:34:10.782 --> 00:34:14.465]  The number on average is about 240-something black folks get killed by police.
[00:34:14.465 --> 00:34:19.329]  Let's just say every one of those folks was innocent, which we know is not true.
[00:34:19.329 --> 00:34:22.132]  Millions of black people get aborted every year.
[00:34:22.132 --> 00:34:23.853]  Tens upon tens of thousands.
[00:34:23.853 --> 00:34:26.315]  It's over 3,000 a year just in Chicago.
[00:34:26.315 --> 00:34:27.757]  Almost all of it black on black.
[00:34:27.757 --> 00:34:30.199]  We're talking death.
[00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:32.000]  Over 3,000 shootings.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:32.541]  2,000 plus deaths.
[00:34:32.541 --> 00:34:33.281]  Look it up yourself.
[00:34:33.281 --> 00:34:35.543]  In fact, that's an old number.
[00:34:35.543 --> 00:34:37.245]  Last year and this year are already worse.
[00:34:38.353 --> 00:34:40.074]  Something like four and a half thousand in 2016?
[00:34:40.074 --> 00:34:50.781]  Test my memory, number of shooting deaths in Chicago, 2016, or maybe it's four thousand plus shootings and three thousand plus deaths.
[00:34:50.781 --> 00:34:53.562]  Let's just pull those numbers up because my memory is usually dead on, but we'll see.
[00:34:53.562 --> 00:35:04.069]  The point is, is that, hmm, let me see, four thousand plus black people shot by black folks in one city versus two hundred and something people shot by cops that are black.
[00:35:06.049 --> 00:35:11.231]  And then they did studies, and they found out cops statistically shoot whites way more often.
[00:35:11.231 --> 00:35:13.552]  You know why, though?
[00:35:13.552 --> 00:35:16.773]  That's because it's not racism, it's fear.
[00:35:16.773 --> 00:35:19.975]  And I guess some of you could say it would be racism.
[00:35:19.975 --> 00:35:29.219]  But most of the black cops I've talked to say they have to slow roll into black areas now, because it doesn't matter, they're wearing blue, they're hated, and folks are going to shoot at them and not appreciate them.
[00:35:29.219 --> 00:35:34.501]  And so you're not going to risk your life as much if it's an area where you know you're hated.
[00:35:36.448 --> 00:35:48.358]  And so the only truth of the racism stuff is that the police are being kicked out of these communities because of media hype, and then it's allowing crime to explode in those communities.
[00:35:48.358 --> 00:35:54.183]  And the truth is the cops go into the Hispanic, white neighborhoods, you name it, mixed neighborhoods, and they'll go into a house during a robbery.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:00.803]  They'll pull over a car full of people that match a description of bank robbers.
[00:36:00.803 --> 00:36:01.363]  They'll do it.
[00:36:01.363 --> 00:36:09.869]  They'll risk their lives in an area where they at least don't feel like they're going to get shot in the back out of some house while they're trying to do it.
[00:36:09.869 --> 00:36:15.112]  And that's a fact!
[00:36:15.112 --> 00:36:17.093]  But see, I know the statistics.
[00:36:17.093 --> 00:36:17.793]  I know the numbers.
[00:36:17.793 --> 00:36:18.414]  I know the facts.
[00:36:20.902 --> 00:36:22.403]  And so do you.
[00:36:22.403 --> 00:36:24.665]  But you got folks brain damaged in the NFL.
[00:36:24.665 --> 00:36:28.489]  I don't care if they're white or black or Hispanic or whatever they are.
[00:36:28.489 --> 00:36:29.370]  They're brain damaged.
[00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:30.751]  They signed up to be gladiators.
[00:36:30.751 --> 00:36:32.753]  Hey, I'm all for a free country.
[00:36:32.753 --> 00:36:34.334]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:36:34.334 --> 00:36:37.697]  People want to pay to watch folks beat their brains out?
[00:36:37.697 --> 00:36:45.845]  Like to watch race car drivers, you know, go around risking their lives, Dale Earnhardt, you name it?
[00:36:45.845 --> 00:36:47.186]  We like to see men risk their lives.
[00:36:49.172 --> 00:36:58.498]  And the NFL got blackmailed by the Justice Department, this is on record, into politically being their tool in the last six years.
[00:36:58.498 --> 00:37:13.868]  And now they're being destroyed because the propaganda that they're putting out in the name of liability protection, meeting with Homeland Security, meeting with the Justice Department, meeting with the different Hollywood spin doctors, has turned America against the NFL.
[00:37:13.868 --> 00:37:14.969]  Hey, we've got an idea!
[00:37:14.969 --> 00:37:16.890]  Let's use the NFL, America's sport,
[00:37:20.538 --> 00:37:28.705]  That we've made America and his mom an apple pie, and let's use it as a weapon.
[00:37:28.705 --> 00:37:32.868]  And they've done that with ESPN, they've done that with all these news shows, and what's happened?
[00:37:32.868 --> 00:37:34.470]  Everyone is deserting them.
[00:37:36.397 --> 00:37:41.040]  And so they start out with a project to do this a few years ago and get one idiot to go to a knee.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.541]  They turn him into a rock star.
[00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:44.582]  You know, he loses his job and everybody hates him.
[00:37:44.582 --> 00:37:51.266]  But still, in the limited bubble of Hollywood and mainstream media, Kaepernick thinks he's really cool!
[00:37:51.266 --> 00:37:54.087]  See, he's so stupid!
[00:37:54.087 --> 00:37:57.449]  He thinks because his little commie mommy is on his side.
[00:37:57.449 --> 00:37:59.671]  You know, the evil white lady that adopted him.
[00:37:59.671 --> 00:38:01.291]  You know, all whites are evil.
[00:38:01.291 --> 00:38:05.454]  Like the whites in the Tennessee church that got shot by the black Muslim migrant.
[00:38:06.857 --> 00:38:07.477]  The child.
[00:38:07.477 --> 00:38:10.079]  They always say, oh, it's bringing in migrant children.
[00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:16.643]  There's another migrant child, what, 26 years old and, you know, out just in a church gunning down the evil white people.
[00:38:16.643 --> 00:38:21.125]  He went to go find Christians and he went to go find white people.
[00:38:21.125 --> 00:38:22.446]  We now know him as M.O.
[00:38:22.446 --> 00:38:23.627]  But that's all right.
[00:38:23.627 --> 00:38:29.710]  You won't be hearing about that anymore by tomorrow.
[00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:32.011]  So here's the good news.
[00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:32.612]  The NFL
[00:38:34.963 --> 00:38:39.107]  is a tool of the globalist, and it's destroying itself.
[00:38:39.107 --> 00:38:58.244]  And all the wailing and flailing and flopping and foot-dragging and screaming and squawking, all of it has done nothing but blow up in their face.
[00:39:02.611 --> 00:39:04.915]  It's too bad the NFL got captured in the last six years.
[00:39:04.915 --> 00:39:15.651]  And it's too bad that now since they've converted their culture into being lapdogs for the globalists, that they aren't smart enough to turn around and smell the coffee.
[00:39:16.633 --> 00:39:16.833]  to look
[00:39:38.325 --> 00:39:45.451]  They hobble up the award show and, you know, their wife gets to feel important because they saw some other movie star there.
[00:39:45.451 --> 00:40:00.583]  And it's all disgusting and boring and stupid and a bunch of retarded peacocks who really care about being cool in this whole system.
[00:40:00.583 --> 00:40:04.907]  And they love radical Islam and they love Linda Saussure and they love it all.
[00:40:06.923 --> 00:40:18.672]  Because even though they're America, and even though on average they're worth 50, 100 million dollars in the NFL, some of them 200, 300 million, despite all that, they feel like losers.
[00:40:18.672 --> 00:40:21.355]  They feel like class envy.
[00:40:21.355 --> 00:40:31.523]  They feel like they have social envy and racial envy, because it's been indoctrinated into them from birth, white, black, it doesn't matter, to hate the country.
[00:40:32.659 --> 00:40:41.601]  To see themselves as inadequate, even though they run the country!
[00:40:41.601 --> 00:40:51.803]  One of their greatest victories, and now it's blown up in their face, was taking the Ron Paul Infowars movement of going and protesting the Republican and Democratic parties ten years ago.
[00:40:51.803 --> 00:40:53.824]  We call it the Tea Party.
[00:40:55.486 --> 00:40:59.729]  And it just meant getting mad at government, going to public events, speaking out, asking them hard questions.
[00:40:59.729 --> 00:41:04.912]  Just like our audience did again in this election, going and saying Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[00:41:04.912 --> 00:41:07.074]  And that taken over the airwaves.
[00:41:07.074 --> 00:41:11.617]  And the Republicans got scared and they said, we better co-opt this and take it over.
[00:41:11.617 --> 00:41:14.159]  And I said, folks, don't freak out.
[00:41:14.159 --> 00:41:16.500]  These old guys want to think they're co-opting it.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.721]  We're co-opting them.
[00:41:17.721 --> 00:41:20.743]  We now have massive Trojan horses in the Republican Party.
[00:41:20.743 --> 00:41:22.664]  We're going to end up putting a president in down the road.
[00:41:22.664 --> 00:41:23.425]  Don't be mad that
[00:41:25.595 --> 00:41:27.698]  Ron Paul didn't win the first time or the second time.
[00:41:27.698 --> 00:41:31.864]  We're building a movement and we're building momentum.
[00:41:31.864 --> 00:41:37.071]  Now you got the Freedom Caucus and we are inches away from taking over the Republican Party.
[00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:41.817]  We're defending the Supreme Court in a desperate fight, but winning right now, but it's desperate.
[00:41:42.816 --> 00:41:48.819]  We are dominating in the states, dominating in the legislatures, finally turning the economy back on.
[00:41:48.819 --> 00:41:54.482]  The socialist engineers and globalist engineers know they want to make folks poor to fool them into deeper control.
[00:41:54.482 --> 00:41:59.704]  That's always the communist program, to get you out of socialism into communism.
[00:41:59.704 --> 00:42:02.846]  But we got a major beachhead with Trump with just his rhetoric.
[00:42:02.846 --> 00:42:10.710]  He's dominating and stopping the bullying and energizing the population as a standard.
[00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:11.250]  As a flag.
[00:42:12.415 --> 00:42:15.176]  He understands that.
[00:42:15.176 --> 00:42:17.976]  And rallying the troops.
[00:42:17.976 --> 00:42:19.137]  Under hellish attack.
[00:42:19.137 --> 00:42:21.297]  Hellishly surrounded.
[00:42:21.297 --> 00:42:25.518]  I love early people bitching and complaining when he doesn't do something perfect or give you whatever you want.
[00:42:25.518 --> 00:42:27.339]  Or they misrepresent what he ever said in the campaign.
[00:42:27.339 --> 00:42:28.459]  They claim he's gone sideways.
[00:42:28.459 --> 00:42:29.259]  No he hasn't.
[00:42:29.259 --> 00:42:35.600]  Except on WikiLeaks and marijuana decriminalization.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.261]  It doesn't matter folks, he's not a globalist.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:44.667]  He's not your sworn enemy and we are under attack by literal globalist pedophile Satan worshipper scum.
[00:42:44.667 --> 00:42:48.731]  Do you understand?
[00:42:48.731 --> 00:42:53.616]  Trump is an Americana bull who's a 71 year old throwback
[00:42:54.687 --> 00:42:56.989]  Bear Knuckles, you know, New Yorker.
[00:42:56.989 --> 00:43:01.132]  You don't think it was easy for his dad to come out of nowhere as an immigrant and build a company.
[00:43:01.132 --> 00:43:03.073]  I mean, they had to do a lot of stuff behind the scenes.
[00:43:03.073 --> 00:43:06.296]  Busting, getting in fights, you name it, to get where they are, folks.
[00:43:06.296 --> 00:43:07.797]  And a lot of other stuff.
[00:43:07.797 --> 00:43:13.941]  But the point is, is that Trump now wants to take on the New World Order.
[00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:18.565]  See, that's what he wants to hunt.
[00:43:18.565 --> 00:43:22.928]  And everybody ought to be thanking their lucky stars every day he's the president.
[00:43:23.976 --> 00:43:25.556]  Or we'd be in giant wars.
[00:43:25.556 --> 00:43:27.777]  It would just be ten times more hellish.
[00:43:27.777 --> 00:43:31.178]  Hillary would just be backing ISIS and Al Qaeda all over the world.
[00:43:31.178 --> 00:43:32.458]  And their whole Islamic Spring.
[00:43:32.458 --> 00:43:34.119]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:43:34.119 --> 00:43:37.339]  And then we see President Trump up there.
[00:43:37.339 --> 00:43:40.300]  Surrounded by these wolves.
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:47.502]  Believe me, I have solidarity with the President because there's only one other person that is as surrounded as me, and that's the President.
[00:43:47.502 --> 00:43:51.363]  I mean, I think it's great because I can fire in all directions politically.
[00:43:51.363 --> 00:43:52.023]  We can kill him!
[00:43:52.881 --> 00:43:57.263]  In the information war, peacefully.
[00:43:57.263 --> 00:43:59.505]  I mean, that figure before they say, I say kill people.
[00:43:59.505 --> 00:44:00.005]  No, no, no.
[00:44:00.005 --> 00:44:01.025]  We don't want violence.
[00:44:01.025 --> 00:44:02.126]  We're winning peacefully.
[00:44:02.126 --> 00:44:05.448]  That's why the globalists want a civil war.
[00:44:05.448 --> 00:44:08.069]  But believe me, I've seen the whites of their eyes.
[00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:09.970]  I've seen the enemy up close.
[00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:11.691]  I've seen what they do behind the scenes.
[00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:18.455]  I've experienced their full attack of the maximum they think they can get away with without making me a martyr.
[00:44:20.455 --> 00:44:26.399]  And all it's done is just enraged me to fight him that much harder.
[00:44:26.399 --> 00:44:31.203]  I've just got to control my anger because it is substantive.
[00:44:31.203 --> 00:44:36.227]  I've got to get smooth like the president and just channel that energy.
[00:44:36.227 --> 00:44:37.247]  But I'm trying, folks.
[00:44:37.247 --> 00:44:38.428]  I'm trying as hard as I can.
[00:44:38.428 --> 00:44:48.756]  But just to see a bunch of spoiled, rotten slobs brainwashed, dumbed down, following the Hollywood establishment,
[00:44:51.403 --> 00:44:57.846]  And people ask why I hadn't been covering the NFL thing much last year or this year.
[00:44:57.846 --> 00:45:07.491]  It's because I've tuned out of it so much, and I'm so sick of it, and I can't even look at people worth $200 million that live in the lap of luxury, one of the freest countries in the world.
[00:45:07.491 --> 00:45:20.397]  And the fact that we had a civil war that killed almost a million people to end slavery, and we elected a black president, on and on and on, but all I hear about is how bad we are, and how by extension, I'm bad!
[00:45:22.967 --> 00:45:25.248]  And my children are bad because they're white!
[00:45:25.248 --> 00:45:37.610]  And I know it's a cooked-up deal by George Soros and big think tanks in their own documents, and it's all a giant fraud, and these idiots won't listen, and won't understand it, and won't get it through their head!
[00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:41.031]  So here's the deal.
[00:45:41.031 --> 00:45:45.792]  The NFL must be boycotted at maximum level.
[00:45:45.792 --> 00:45:47.973]  Everyone needs to go out now, and the target
[00:45:48.857 --> 00:45:54.398]  ...is to demonstrate on the main roads coming in at NFL stadiums, and I'm gonna do it.
[00:45:54.398 --> 00:45:55.718]  And you need to do it.
[00:45:55.718 --> 00:46:12.642]  And go out there with signs saying the NFL equals BLM, or NFL equals Hollywood Elite, or NFL has been taken over, and we need to expose it, and how they got taken over by the Justice Department, that's admitted, and we need to absolutely go out and shame them at every event.
[00:46:13.533 --> 00:46:22.935]  And it's sports bars, or wherever, because I went to a sports bar this weekend with my wife because they had really good hamburgers and stuff, and I didn't mind that college football was on.
[00:46:23.871 --> 00:46:27.872]  But I tell you, if they get political, I'm going to tell folks, hey, let's turn this off.
[00:46:27.872 --> 00:46:32.533]  And they may not turn it off every time, but there's going to be enough of them where I'm going to walk around to the tables and say, you know what?
[00:46:32.533 --> 00:46:35.554]  We should stop watching the NFL, because they hate this country.
[00:46:35.554 --> 00:46:37.434]  And the folks say, I really don't care, whatever.
[00:46:37.434 --> 00:46:39.435]  Say, then you don't care about anything or a future.
[00:46:39.435 --> 00:46:44.196]  And you should call the owners of these sports bars and say, hey, get in the paper anyways.
[00:46:44.196 --> 00:46:44.816]  Boycott them.
[00:46:44.816 --> 00:46:46.397]  Say, we're not playing the game here.
[00:46:46.397 --> 00:46:47.477]  We're going to watch something else.
[00:46:48.404 --> 00:46:52.605]  Because what really matters at sports bars is getting around other people and talking and stuff.
[00:46:52.605 --> 00:46:56.547]  It's not about going and watching the stupid force-fed Hollywood crap.
[00:46:56.547 --> 00:47:01.569]  And if all of you just do a little bit like that, they'll be destroyed even faster.
[00:47:01.569 --> 00:47:03.209]  And we need to send them a message.
[00:47:03.209 --> 00:47:04.530]  Hollywood's already collapsing.
[00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:06.970]  That's admitted.
[00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:11.492]  It's crumbling.
[00:47:11.492 --> 00:47:14.833]  MSNBC, all the major news channels are falling apart.
[00:47:14.833 --> 00:47:15.953]  ESPN is falling apart.
[00:47:15.953 --> 00:47:17.274]  The NFL is plunging.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:19.100]  And then what do they do?
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:24.382]  They arrogantly double down like a degenerate gambler and have gone all in on us.
[00:47:24.382 --> 00:47:26.403]  And we've got an excellent hand, folks.
[00:47:26.403 --> 00:47:28.684]  We've got a royal flush if we play it.
[00:47:28.684 --> 00:47:30.985]  They've got a bunch of nothings.
[00:47:30.985 --> 00:47:34.306]  Some ones, some twos, some threes, and their little fat hands.
[00:47:34.306 --> 00:47:39.548]  We've got the royal flush, but we can't be bluffed by them.
[00:47:39.548 --> 00:47:42.269]  We gotta let them play their hand out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:43.217 --> 00:47:46.618]  Before we play our handout, you've got to realize what you've got in your hand.
[00:47:46.618 --> 00:47:48.299]  You've got Americana.
[00:47:48.299 --> 00:47:49.079]  You've got guts.
[00:47:49.079 --> 00:47:49.779]  You've got glory.
[00:47:49.779 --> 00:47:50.600]  You've got will.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:51.500]  You've got understanding.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:55.001]  You see through their crap.
[00:47:55.001 --> 00:48:01.744]  Black to Hispanic football player on the Steelers, who's an Army veteran of the Army Rangers, combat veteran.
[00:48:01.744 --> 00:48:07.086]  And they're talking about disciplining him, because the coach said the team gives the orders around here.
[00:48:08.749 --> 00:48:15.915]  So you get one guy getting on his knee at first and then bullying everybody else and then everybody says, we're just going to stay in the locker room.
[00:48:15.915 --> 00:48:21.859]  Oh, but the coaches and the teams find folks for spiking the football or doing celebrations or whatever.
[00:48:21.859 --> 00:48:23.660]  Oh, but you can desecrate the flag.
[00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:25.042]  You can piss on the veterans.
[00:48:25.042 --> 00:48:34.929]  You can do that because that's what the corporate bosses want up on top, is to bully the president and use the NFL as a tool of anti-Americana.
[00:48:34.929 --> 00:48:38.412]  It's not that America's perfect, but they're trying to replace it with globalism.
[00:48:41.633 --> 00:48:43.435]  Let's play that clip of the president.
[00:48:43.435 --> 00:48:44.456]  The clip that started it all.
[00:48:44.456 --> 00:48:45.597]  Here it is.
[00:48:45.597 --> 00:48:54.965]  Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, get that son of a bitch off the field right now.
[00:48:54.965 --> 00:48:55.326]  Out.
[00:48:55.326 --> 00:48:57.247]  He's fired.
[00:48:57.247 --> 00:48:58.188]  He's fired!
[00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.032]  Let's stop right there.
[00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:15.495]  The fact that people would think this was radical.
[00:49:15.495 --> 00:49:20.139]  The globalists have decided to demoralize us, shut our economy down, sell us out.
[00:49:20.139 --> 00:49:22.001]  That's the official globalist plan.
[00:49:22.001 --> 00:49:31.149]  Just like Obama goes to South Africa, goes to Nigeria, goes to other African countries, and says you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[00:49:31.149 --> 00:49:32.910]  It's the same deal.
[00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:35.973]  This guy shows up and he goes, yeah, you can have cars and air conditioning.
[00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:36.734]  You're not the problem.
[00:49:39.462 --> 00:49:47.450]  And let's all come together, and let's love each other, and hugging black people all over TV, and going to black churches and being prayed for, and having Christians in the White House.
[00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:48.912]  Trump really believes in all this.
[00:49:48.912 --> 00:49:53.096]  And that's why they're calling him a racist.
[00:49:53.096 --> 00:49:58.401]  Because they're calling having a country and having a flag and having a culture racist.
[00:49:58.401 --> 00:50:01.605]  Because the globalists, in their own admissions, want to erase
[00:50:03.098 --> 00:50:11.923]  All culture, but their new globalist culture, that's like a computer program that they can tell you, this is political correctness this month, next month it's something entirely different.
[00:50:11.923 --> 00:50:22.550]  It's 1984, where you're like, have your whole memory erased every time and you're just something new every time they tell you, and you think it's cool to be poor, you think it's cool to be a chump, you think it's cool to be an idiot.
[00:50:23.916 --> 00:50:37.445]  So this NFL thing is so big because Trump has had the courage to do it and say, boycott the NFL, it's a wimp sport now, it's a joke, it's been taken over, it's controlled, and it's political, and it hates our veterans, and blah blah blah.
[00:50:37.445 --> 00:50:38.265]  He didn't even say that.
[00:50:38.265 --> 00:50:43.669]  Then they come out, they do all that, and the NFL declared war on America.
[00:50:43.669 --> 00:50:44.729]  And they're going to lose.
[00:50:44.729 --> 00:50:48.292]  But only by this full-on attack did we finally wake up!
[00:50:49.295 --> 00:50:53.879]  To a bunch of these little one-inch tall Lilliputians beating the snot out of us!
[00:50:53.879 --> 00:50:57.183]  But once we get up on our hind legs, folks, it's clobberin' time!
[00:50:58.379 --> 00:51:01.722]  Hey Daniel Bregman, why NuMana storable foods?

[00:51:58.183 --> 00:52:00.144]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:52:00.144 --> 00:52:07.048]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.

[00:53:34.724 --> 00:53:36.485]  On smartphones.
[00:53:36.485 --> 00:53:39.407]  Over 90% of consumers still listen to radio every week.
[00:53:39.407 --> 00:53:45.070]  That makes choosing radio as a place to advertise your business one of the best decisions you can make.
[00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:51.713]  Email advertise at GCNLive.com and partner up with an experienced GCN representative.
[00:53:51.713 --> 00:53:54.215]  Advertise at GCNLive.com.
[00:53:54.215 --> 00:53:54.715]  Easy.
[00:53:54.715 --> 00:53:55.555]  Affordable.
[00:53:55.555 --> 00:53:56.216]  Effective.
[00:54:38.148 --> 00:54:38.288]  Yeah.
[00:54:47.051 --> 00:54:50.393]  You know, we've got Andrew Tate.
[00:54:50.393 --> 00:55:09.048]  He's an American-British kickboxer, world champion in his weight class, but a really smart guy, who I was already aware of a few years ago, but I didn't know his politics, and I saw him on the Paul Watson a few weeks ago, and just really smart guy, but I want to get his take on this National Anthem thing, especially because he's American and British.
[00:55:09.048 --> 00:55:10.630]  What is it like, imagine,
[00:55:12.722 --> 00:55:24.632]  If he came to the United States for a US-British soccer game or something, and then imagine booing or getting on your knee for the British anthem, but then standing up for the American anthem.
[00:55:24.632 --> 00:55:27.474]  And imagine the coaches all doing it!
[00:55:27.474 --> 00:55:29.616]  And the assistant coaches, and everybody!
[00:55:29.616 --> 00:55:33.339]  I mean, it's just war on America!
[00:55:33.339 --> 00:55:38.303]  Psychological, outrageous, crazy town.
[00:55:38.303 --> 00:55:38.744]  Meanwhile,
[00:55:41.817 --> 00:55:47.660]  This is so profound, I should have opened the whole broadcast up with this, and this is what I should be saying like a parrot.
[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:49.101]  Mayday, mayday, mayday.
[00:55:49.101 --> 00:55:51.243]  We're invaded by globalist propagandists.
[00:55:51.243 --> 00:55:52.603]  They're trying to cause a civil war.
[00:55:52.603 --> 00:55:57.306]  It's all admitted in the WikiLeaks, but you can watch it on television unfold or see it in the streets.
[00:55:57.306 --> 00:56:03.530]  This country's being manipulated by foreign enemies that are totally cold-blooded, who've overthrown countless other nations.
[00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:05.471]  What is our problem?
[00:56:05.471 --> 00:56:07.592]  They just overthrew the whole Middle East.
[00:56:07.592 --> 00:56:09.133]  They just overthrew Ukraine.
[00:56:09.133 --> 00:56:10.414]  They brag they did it.
[00:56:12.128 --> 00:56:15.033]  And they manipulate cultural differences.
[00:56:15.033 --> 00:56:18.899]  In Ukraine, it's Orthodox versus Catholic.
[00:56:18.899 --> 00:56:20.622]  Christians.
[00:56:20.622 --> 00:56:24.929]  And they brag about how they do it, it's so stupid!
[00:56:24.929 --> 00:56:26.291]  But the people being conned...
[00:56:27.543 --> 00:56:29.684]  They just don't want to ever admit they got conned.
[00:56:29.684 --> 00:56:33.525]  They get into it, they believe it, and they won't say they're wrong.
[00:56:33.525 --> 00:56:40.227]  If I've got any attribute, it's that when I found out I'm wrong, I say it, I want to be better, I admit it to myself.
[00:56:40.227 --> 00:56:45.689]  So many other people just will never admit when they've been scammed.
[00:56:45.689 --> 00:56:54.091]  I ran into somebody else that I hadn't seen in a while, a good friend of mine, and they were being scammed by Nigerians again.
[00:56:54.091 --> 00:56:56.532]  And I got in an argument with them and they actually started getting irritated with me.
[00:57:01.688 --> 00:57:03.369]  I just don't know what to do at this point.
[00:57:03.369 --> 00:57:06.692]  I just don't know what to do.
[00:57:06.692 --> 00:57:12.138]  But meanwhile, while all this is happening, our country is under attack, and just last Friday, the U.S.
[00:57:12.138 --> 00:57:19.004]  with B-2 bombers did nuclear bomb attack runs on the DMZ.
[00:57:19.004 --> 00:57:23.228]  I've studied the military, and I've studied the Korean conflict.
[00:57:23.228 --> 00:57:25.090]  The only way you do it is total destruction.
[00:57:26.596 --> 00:57:28.897]  The media was even asking, is Trump listening to Jones again?
[00:57:28.897 --> 00:57:32.458]  Because now he's talking about total destruction and total commitment if we hit him.
[00:57:32.458 --> 00:57:33.759]  No, that's what you do.
[00:57:33.759 --> 00:57:35.299]  There'll be no surgical strike.
[00:57:35.299 --> 00:57:38.280]  Because North Korea will go totally crazy if you do.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.761]  There's only total commitment.
[00:57:39.761 --> 00:57:48.604]  And now they said last week, on Saturday, they had a special session of the UN, because they cancelled it Friday, the North Korean head diplomat
[00:57:50.092 --> 00:58:03.123]  The legate, the spokesman, the mouth of Kim Jong-un said, we have no option left, so we're going to attack the US mainland with a hydrogen bomb and the attack is imminent.
[00:58:03.123 --> 00:58:07.768]  I'm pointing a gun at you, I'm going to pull the trigger.
[00:58:07.768 --> 00:58:10.150]  We have to hit them now!
[00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:12.472]  And I'm not a warmonger, neither is Joel Skousen.
[00:58:12.472 --> 00:58:14.394]  He's been against all these wars the last 20 years.
[00:58:14.394 --> 00:58:15.735]  He says this is the real war.
[00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:19.170]  You're gonna hit him, hit him!
[00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:21.110]  This is real, folks!
[00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:22.471]  This isn't a game!
[00:58:22.471 --> 00:58:25.052]  And you notice the Globalists put North Korea in there.
[00:58:25.052 --> 00:58:25.813]  They gave them the weapons.
[00:58:25.813 --> 00:58:26.833]  See, it's the same thing.
[00:58:26.833 --> 00:58:28.414]  There's a lot of players behind the scenes.
[00:58:28.414 --> 00:58:32.636]  By the way, we extended it a while, but we are ending the food deal today.
[00:58:32.636 --> 00:58:34.677]  I extended it, I said another week, they can't do it anymore.

[00:58:36.918 --> 00:58:38.538]  Highest quality, take advantage.

[00:58:39.479 --> 00:58:42.520]  It ends today, it ends today, it ends today, it ends today.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.881]  We'll be back in the second hour.
[00:58:43.881 --> 00:58:45.241]  Please support us and pray for us.
[00:58:45.241 --> 00:58:46.142]  We're under massive attack.
[00:58:49.133 --> 00:58:54.197]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:58:54.197 --> 00:59:04.204]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many
[00:59:04.264 --> 00:59:04.444]  Yes.
[00:59:23.308 --> 00:59:23.968]  We're good.
[00:59:51.768 --> 01:00:07.533]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.533 --> 01:00:13.775]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.615 --> 01:00:24.457]  All right, folks.
[01:00:24.457 --> 01:00:26.539]  When I come back, I'm laying it all out.
[01:00:26.539 --> 01:00:31.625]  This country's under globalist attack, that our energy systems cut off, they've turned our people against each other.
[01:00:33.325 --> 01:00:37.126]  David Florida ain't in the water, which even CNN now admits causes massive brain damage.
[01:00:37.126 --> 01:00:40.327]  I mean, we have been hit hard by a globalist infestation.
[01:00:40.327 --> 01:00:41.808]  But we're starting to wake up.
[01:00:41.808 --> 01:00:44.009]  We're starting to try to get the poison out of our system.
[01:00:44.009 --> 01:00:49.371]  And the globalists are coming back and coming back hard on every front, trying to destabilize the country.
[01:00:49.371 --> 01:00:55.333]  And I'm going to break it all down with world champion kickboxer, who's a really smart guy, coming up here in the next segment.
[01:00:55.993 --> 01:01:13.325]  But right now, you need to understand, turning off our energy, they need to sell us on the idea that we can't have coal, because we have the cleanest coal in the world, enough for over a thousand years, and if our coal gets cut off and then only China can operate with it, it makes their energy three, four times cheaper, and then all our jobs can't help but move there.
[01:01:13.325 --> 01:01:14.346]  So that's why they're doing this.
[01:01:14.346 --> 01:01:15.367]  Here's John Bowne's report.
[01:01:16.167 --> 01:01:22.190]  So if a tsunami hits you or an earthquake happens, that's not because you're an evil person.
[01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:26.272]  It's because that's the ever-changing planet we live on.
[01:01:26.272 --> 01:01:28.173]  Hurricanes.
[01:01:28.173 --> 01:01:29.074]  Cyclones.
[01:01:29.074 --> 01:01:31.095]  Typhoons.
[01:01:31.095 --> 01:01:33.276]  Earthquakes.
[01:01:33.276 --> 01:01:34.717]  Volcanoes.
[01:01:34.717 --> 01:01:41.020]  The way God curses us is us cursing ourselves and being corrupt and being evil and letting corruption take over.
[01:01:42.591 --> 01:01:49.515]  And if you look at all of the abuses of government and corrupt institutions, it's hundreds of times what natural disasters are.
[01:01:49.515 --> 01:01:57.460]  And I love how the left always says it's voodoo when some Christian preacher says, we've been hit by a hurricane because there's gay people in Florida or whatever.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:02.063]  And quite frankly, that is discrediting voodoo, in my view.
[01:02:03.407 --> 01:02:05.288]  The preacher doesn't speak for God.
[01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:14.793]  But it's just as bad when some leftist says, good, God sent a hurricane to kill all the rednecks in Texas or kill all the Trump voters in Florida.
[01:02:14.793 --> 01:02:23.097]  Trump offers condolences to Mexico after 7.1 quake, leftists still attack the president on Twitter.
[01:02:23.097 --> 01:02:27.840]  God bless the people of Mexico City, Trump tweeted and stated.
[01:02:28.988 --> 01:02:35.816]  Within minutes of the 7.1 magnitude earthquake striking Mexico City Tuesday, President Trump and his wife offered swift condolences.
[01:02:35.816 --> 01:02:39.820]  But that wasn't enough for leftists, many of whom didn't bother to check whether the U.S.
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.924]  President had commented on the earthquake.
[01:02:42.924 --> 01:02:50.252]  Instead of focusing on the relief efforts, Trump haters predictably used the latest Mexico City quake as another opportunity to attack Trump.
[01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:53.432]  Others even blamed Trump for the earthquake.
[01:02:53.432 --> 01:03:01.640]  And others asked if Trump would finally acknowledge climate change with one stating, God's not helping, so we have to.
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:05.985]  Wanting Trump to again come out and make statements he'd already made.
[01:03:07.915 --> 01:03:13.477]  Here's another statement, waiting for Trump to ignore the earthquake in Mexico City, still denying climate change is a thing.
[01:03:13.477 --> 01:03:19.540]  So now they're saying earthquakes are man-made anthropogenic climate change.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:28.464]  First it was global freezing was man in the 80s, then it was global warming, then it started cooling off a little bit, then went, it's just change, period.
[01:03:28.464 --> 01:03:32.886]  And now they've moved on with the total made-up garbage that earthquakes
[01:03:33.948 --> 01:03:35.929]  Are caused by humans, no.
[01:03:35.929 --> 01:03:46.695]  They're caused by the gigantic sun that's firing all different sorts of ions and different radiation wavelengths at the giant Earth.
[01:03:46.695 --> 01:04:01.883]  And then that energy goes in and builds up on the outside and penetrates the crust and it causes electromagnetic reflections with the nickel core of the planet.
[01:04:02.864 --> 01:04:08.707]  It's got so much gravity, it's solid, even though it's super hot.
[01:04:08.707 --> 01:04:22.073]  And then that causes all sorts of reflections back and forth between the crust, the mantle, and the core of the Earth, with the sun's radiation, and that's directly linked to earthquakes.
[01:04:22.073 --> 01:04:24.774]  What's been happening the last three weeks?
[01:04:24.774 --> 01:04:28.536]  Mega mass coronal ejections from the sun.
[01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:34.433]  And they haven't been directly hitting us as they shoot out like flamethrowers.
[01:04:34.433 --> 01:04:40.455]  But then as the sun turns, the dissipated storms still hit us.
[01:04:40.455 --> 01:04:41.536]  And they're massive.
[01:04:41.536 --> 01:04:43.317]  And they blow out satellites.
[01:04:43.317 --> 01:04:47.079]  And if you're an astronaut up there and one of them hits you, it'll kill you.
[01:04:47.079 --> 01:04:50.660]  And that's what's driving these earthquakes is the sun.
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:51.641]  The sun.
[01:04:51.641 --> 01:04:52.541]  The sun.
[01:04:52.541 --> 01:04:53.462]  The sun.
[01:04:53.462 --> 01:04:53.922]  The sun.
[01:04:56.019 --> 01:05:00.863]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com with some patriotic quotes by Ron Paul.
[01:05:00.863 --> 01:05:09.610]  The most basic principle to being a free American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for our own lives and decisions.
[01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:13.813]  We do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make up for our own mistakes.
[01:05:14.033 --> 01:05:20.258]  Neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to live, so long as we aren't infringing on their rights.
[01:05:20.258 --> 01:05:24.822]  Freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones.
[01:05:24.822 --> 01:05:28.846]  If we are only free to make good decisions, then we are not really free.
[01:05:28.846 --> 01:05:35.932]  Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints.
[01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:42.255]  Random searches, mandatory identification cards, and paramilitary police in our streets.
[01:05:42.255 --> 01:05:45.377]  We have lost a vital part of our American heritage.
[01:05:45.377 --> 01:05:49.999]  America was born of protests, revolution, and mistrust of government.
[01:05:49.999 --> 01:05:54.021]  Subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long.
[01:05:55.999 --> 01:06:00.641]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[01:06:56.590 --> 01:07:05.675]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:05.675 --> 01:07:13.799]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:14.079 --> 01:07:14.700]  We're good to go!
[01:07:43.939 --> 01:07:44.440]  I don't think so.
[01:08:06.056 --> 01:08:07.217]  Big Brother.
[01:08:07.217 --> 01:08:08.958]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:08.958 --> 01:08:10.258]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:10.258 --> 01:08:12.580]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:14.261]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:21.345]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.345 --> 01:08:30.730]  Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, get that son of a bitch off the field right now.
[01:08:30.730 --> 01:08:31.070]  Out.
[01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:32.991]  He's fired.
[01:08:32.991 --> 01:08:33.912]  He's fired!
[01:08:36.305 --> 01:08:36.817]  I don't really like that.
[01:09:01.826 --> 01:09:07.953]  You know, you can say that the chant USA is mindless until you understand what they're trying to replace it with.
[01:09:07.953 --> 01:09:11.918]  Venezuela, North Korea, globalism, a bunch of socialism.
[01:09:11.918 --> 01:09:12.339]  That's what...
[01:09:13.462 --> 01:09:19.184]  George Soros and others want, because they're multinationals, they're exempt from it, they want to exploit your countries.
[01:09:19.184 --> 01:09:41.991]  And they want to create this butt-hurt mentality, where you go to school, you go to college to get a chip on your shoulder, and be taught about how horrible your country is, but not about all the other horrible stuff about other nations, because if you studied other nations, nine times out of ten, they've got worse histories than we do, and they never have as illustrious a history as we do, except maybe
[01:09:43.428 --> 01:09:44.329]  Rome?
[01:09:44.329 --> 01:09:50.513]  Wasn't even Italy then, it was the Roman Empire, maybe the British Empire?
[01:09:50.513 --> 01:09:58.559]  But you look at the United States, trailblazing so much freedom, so much innovation, the apple of the world's eye, the land of the free!
[01:09:58.559 --> 01:10:05.004]  Hell, they still got slavery in many areas of the Middle East, and Africa, but you never hear about it, or this latest Islamic guy that went and shot
[01:10:06.127 --> 01:10:07.588]  Eight, nine people killed one.
[01:10:07.588 --> 01:10:08.469]  A lady had a gun.
[01:10:08.469 --> 01:10:09.310]  A man had a gun.
[01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:10.711]  One of the ushers had a gun.
[01:10:10.711 --> 01:10:12.112]  They were able to shoot him and stop him.
[01:10:12.112 --> 01:10:14.274]  Another islamicist!
[01:10:14.274 --> 01:10:16.436]  But you won't even learn the names of the victims there.
[01:10:16.436 --> 01:10:27.585]  Because it was a black guy shooting white people who said he was a black nationalist and a muslim and then he wanted to go kill some white christians.
[01:10:27.585 --> 01:10:32.229]  Will whites take a knee at the NFL and blame all black people for this?
[01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:33.090]  Absolutely not!
[01:10:36.095 --> 01:10:38.976]  It's amazing.
[01:10:38.976 --> 01:10:39.697]  Look at these headlines.
[01:10:39.697 --> 01:10:41.558]  Trump calls for NFL boycott.
[01:10:41.558 --> 01:10:43.319]  Praises fans who booed players.
[01:10:43.319 --> 01:10:45.340]  Feud with athletes escalates.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.581]  Has nothing to do with race.
[01:10:47.581 --> 01:10:49.702]  Goodell ignored league's own rules.
[01:10:49.702 --> 01:10:53.064]  Sponsors stay quiet.
[01:10:53.064 --> 01:10:55.285]  Brady just divisive.
[01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:56.885]  200 plus players take knee. 23
[01:11:00.717 --> 01:11:04.881]  It goes on, gear burned, that's our story, on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:11:04.881 --> 01:11:13.811]  Protests spread to arts world as threats and theaters take on Trump.
[01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:16.714]  Wall Street Journal, the politicization of everything.
[01:11:16.714 --> 01:11:18.656]  Limbaugh, thrill of NFL's gone.
[01:11:20.578 --> 01:11:25.939]  Yes, they politicized the NFL with the whole concussion thing with the Justice Department six years ago.
[01:11:25.939 --> 01:11:27.520]  They rolled over.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.521]  The NFL also had all the corruption of fixing games and paying bounties.
[01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:36.702]  The Justice Department came in, the NFL, and their owners rolled because they were all threatened with jail time.
[01:11:36.702 --> 01:11:43.164]  So the Obama-globalist-Clinton mafia, this is the big secret, came in and took over the NFL.
[01:11:44.377 --> 01:11:45.798]  And now they're not allowed to hit as hard.
[01:11:45.798 --> 01:11:48.960]  And now they gotta have anti-gun messages and anti-family messages.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.781]  And now they can't be patriotic.
[01:11:50.781 --> 01:11:54.844]  And the owners have all gotten in line, scared.
[01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:57.366]  And there's Trump taking it on, head on.
[01:11:57.366 --> 01:12:02.389]  That's the big secret to all of this.
[01:12:02.389 --> 01:12:04.470]  So no, this is hype to bring the country down.
[01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:06.452]  Now, I wanted to get this going weeks ago, just about.
[01:12:07.677 --> 01:12:17.708]  The SJWs and people criticizing him for saying that most so-called depression is fake and that you need to go out, exercise, get outside.
[01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:23.815]  50 years ago doctors told you, 20 years ago, go out, get some sun, go out for a jog, go do something, stop watching TV all day.
[01:12:24.335 --> 01:12:27.716]  When he said that, he got millions of Twitter folks attacking him.
[01:12:27.716 --> 01:12:28.017]  Millions.
[01:12:28.017 --> 01:12:29.557]  It was a big news story.
[01:12:29.557 --> 01:12:33.299]  I wanted to get him on because I saw him with Paul Watson, just incredibly smart, eloquent guy.
[01:12:33.299 --> 01:12:35.660]  So I kind of jumped in during that fourth hour.
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:38.301]  And so we got him with us the next 30, 40 minutes or so.
[01:12:38.301 --> 01:12:40.542]  Then I'm going to open the phones up and get to all this other news.
[01:12:40.542 --> 01:12:49.966]  But what a time to be alive when our nuclear bombers just did attack dry runs over the weekend on the DMZ of simulating nuclear attacks on the DMZ.
[01:12:50.506 --> 01:12:53.689]  Because they've got a million troops on the DMZ threatening to invade South Korea.
[01:12:53.689 --> 01:12:57.392]  So if the war kicks off, you've got to neutralize them in minutes.
[01:12:57.392 --> 01:13:00.794]  We can't win a conventional war short time with North Korea.
[01:13:00.794 --> 01:13:03.317]  They've got a two million man brainwashed army.
[01:13:03.317 --> 01:13:07.420]  A million of them on the border right now, whacked out of their brains, brainwashed.
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:13.125]  Kim Jong-un over the weekend and his top ambassador said, an attack on America is imminent with a hydrogen bomb.
[01:13:13.125 --> 01:13:14.446]  We are cocked and ready.
[01:13:14.446 --> 01:13:15.927]  We're going to attack you.
[01:13:15.927 --> 01:13:17.949]  So this is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:23.594]  Joining us here, ladies and gentlemen, is Andrew Tate.
[01:13:23.594 --> 01:13:28.740]  Tate, and then it's S-H-I-N-K-A-I dot net.
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.865]  That's Andrew Tate, and he's at Cobra Tate as well.
[01:13:32.865 --> 01:13:34.787]  He's an American British kickboxer.
[01:13:34.787 --> 01:13:39.908]  He's a boxer from Chicago, Illinois, who competes in the cruiserweight and heavyweight divisions.
[01:13:39.908 --> 01:13:44.930]  He is three times ISKA kickboxing world champion and Infusion Live champion.
[01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:53.432]  He's a son of the late chess master Emery Tate and also a commentator on Real Extreme Fighting and largest MMA promotion in Romania.
[01:13:53.432 --> 01:14:00.394]  In 2016, Tate competed in the 17th season, a British version of Dutch reality show Big Brother as well.
[01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:01.555]  And again, we appreciate him.
[01:14:02.615 --> 01:14:07.299]  Joining us to cover the waterfront, and I don't know his views on this, but we're about to find out.
[01:14:07.299 --> 01:14:09.721]  What do you think of this NFL thing?
[01:14:09.721 --> 01:14:17.007]  What do you think of, like, just everything's politicized, everyone's piling on, they're now saying the American flag needs to be banned, it's white supremacist.
[01:14:17.007 --> 01:14:18.709]  I mean, we knew that was coming next.
[01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:25.274]  This is really, to me, the NFL protesting America and the American flag, and it's not like they're in North Korea.
[01:14:25.274 --> 01:14:30.098]  They're in one of the richest countries in the world, it's an American sport, and they're pissing all over themselves.
[01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:30.599]  What do you think?
[01:14:31.513 --> 01:14:33.954]  This is absolute garbage.
[01:14:33.954 --> 01:14:44.299]  I think to see these privileged millionaires, overpaid sports stars, to sit and complain about oppression is probably one of the most ridiculous things I've seen in modern time.
[01:14:44.299 --> 01:14:45.640]  And that's the absolute truth.
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:54.685]  These people need to travel the world and go to some of the places I've been and see how most people are forced to live their lives under the dictatorships of some countries.
[01:14:54.685 --> 01:14:57.226]  And then they will have absolute respect for the country they're born in.
[01:14:57.665 --> 01:15:02.766]  They're getting overpaid to play a game when there's people out here struggling to pay the bills.
[01:15:02.766 --> 01:15:15.289]  And I think it's no coincidence that it's all these sports stars and music stars and all these overpaid leftists that are going to be constantly complaining about issues that they shouldn't be complaining about because they live such spoiled, entitled lives.
[01:15:15.289 --> 01:15:18.709]  They need to stand up and they need to show respect to the country they live in.
[01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:22.630]  The country that gave them opportunity to become a millionaire playing a sport they love.
[01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:25.571]  And Trump is absolutely correct in what he said.
[01:15:25.571 --> 01:15:30.092]  If you're not going to show respect to this country, you should not be playing football in America anywhere.
[01:15:30.092 --> 01:15:32.273]  I completely agree with him.
[01:15:32.273 --> 01:15:41.795]  Why do you think this has been going on for three, four years now and it's growing and it's killing the sport and then still they don't care and the owners don't care?
[01:15:41.795 --> 01:15:44.256]  From what I've heard, they're bullied by the players.
[01:15:44.256 --> 01:15:51.858]  It's just the players are a bunch of crybabies who want to be celebrities and want to be cool and they think this is the cool thing to do.
[01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:54.451]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:15:54.451 --> 01:15:59.975]  Disliking Trump is the easiest popularity move in the world.
[01:15:59.975 --> 01:16:08.441]  Every single one of these celebrities, it doesn't matter who they are, every rap star, every sports star, as soon as they get a chance to have a shot at Trump, they do it.
[01:16:08.441 --> 01:16:13.784]  Because they believe it's an easy shot towards a quick gain in popularity amongst morons.
[01:16:13.784 --> 01:16:14.645]  That's the truth.
[01:16:14.645 --> 01:16:19.328]  They say, if I stand up there and I say Trump's a bad person, everyone's going to cheer and everyone's going to like me.
[01:16:19.328 --> 01:16:20.449]  And they're so pathetic.
[01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:22.772]  In their internalization.
[01:16:22.772 --> 01:16:25.436]  They can't sit and have a genuine opinion for themselves.
[01:16:25.436 --> 01:16:30.422]  They think, no, liking Trump is a bad thing and disliking Trump is how you become popular in this sphere.
[01:16:30.422 --> 01:16:38.572]  So I'm just going to sit there and anything Trump says is bad and I'm going to do anything it takes to defy him to try and make it look like I'm a good person.
[01:16:38.972 --> 01:16:40.114]  Why is Floyd Mayweather different?
[01:16:56.014 --> 01:17:01.401]  The vast majority of these athletes, white, black, it doesn't matter, just think it's fun to virtue signal.
[01:17:01.401 --> 01:17:04.866]  But then when Trump or somebody else stands up and says, no, you're wrong.
[01:17:04.866 --> 01:17:06.748]  Oh, then he's the worst guy in the world.
[01:17:06.748 --> 01:17:07.589]  That's another thing.
[01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:09.231]  We're not supposed to have our speech.
[01:17:09.231 --> 01:17:11.354]  They cancel people's free speech at all these universities.
[01:17:12.495 --> 01:17:16.818]  It's because they know conservatives and libertarians are busy working and aren't little babies.
[01:17:16.818 --> 01:17:18.639]  They know we don't boycott them.
[01:17:18.639 --> 01:17:21.241]  They know that we're used to having people attack us.
[01:17:21.241 --> 01:17:26.944]  And I think it's now time for folks to start boycotting and let them have their own medicine, and that is happening.
[01:17:26.944 --> 01:17:28.045]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:17:28.045 --> 01:17:30.687]  And it's actually, you know, Floyd Mayweather is almost a hero of mine, so...
[01:17:31.514 --> 01:17:40.437]  I'm super glad when I saw his interview about Trump, he agreed and said some sensibilities, because I liked him before that, and I would have hated to have changed my opinion on the guy.
[01:17:40.437 --> 01:17:41.817]  But he's a self-made man.
[01:17:41.817 --> 01:17:46.439]  He's a self-made man who's come from absolutely nothing to be one of the richest people in the world.
[01:17:46.439 --> 01:17:47.779]  Thank you to America.
[01:17:47.779 --> 01:17:49.580]  Thank you to everything America's been built on.
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:51.240]  Thank you to American values.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.841]  Thank you to his skill and talent alone.
[01:17:52.841 --> 01:18:00.363]  He's absolutely lived the American dream, and he's smart enough to respect the country and respect the leader of the country that's allowed him to do so.
[01:18:00.783 --> 01:18:04.965]  These other people are still living the American dream, and they're upset about something.
[01:18:04.965 --> 01:18:11.788]  I really would love, I would absolutely love for all these NFL players to drop the NFL crap, go get a real job.
[01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:17.551]  Go work a real job for a good six months and see if you still dislike Trump when he's out here trying to create jobs for the everyday American.
[01:18:17.931 --> 01:18:19.714]  And I guarantee they'll change their opinion.
[01:18:19.714 --> 01:18:20.896]  They're entitled brats.
[01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:23.319]  It's just like when you have a child and you give them too much too early.
[01:18:23.319 --> 01:18:25.522]  This is exactly the reason these people are doing this.
[01:18:25.522 --> 01:18:32.892]  And they think that by taking up a stand against Trump, who in the media's eyes is the devil regardless, is a good popularity move.
[01:18:32.892 --> 01:18:33.573]  It's ridiculous.
[01:18:33.573 --> 01:18:34.555]  It really is ridiculous.
[01:18:36.769 --> 01:18:46.355]  About the one army ranger, Hispanic American, Alejandro Villanueva, who marched out there and held his hand over his chest during it.
[01:18:46.355 --> 01:18:47.655]  The only stealer not to.
[01:18:47.655 --> 01:18:53.799]  And now the coach is bad-mouthing him, saying he was bad, he should have stood with his team.
[01:18:53.799 --> 01:18:57.521]  No, he's the only one that had any courage to buck the brainwashing.
[01:18:57.521 --> 01:19:00.323]  And they're actually talking about maybe he's going to get in trouble.
[01:19:01.821 --> 01:19:03.342]  Stand with your team, why?
[01:19:03.342 --> 01:19:04.522]  For unity?
[01:19:04.522 --> 01:19:06.623]  Well, if it's for unity, what about unity to your country?
[01:19:06.623 --> 01:19:07.924]  What about Americans as a whole?
[01:19:07.924 --> 01:19:14.747]  If you want to talk about unity, every single American should be unified underneath the flag, and unified underneath the national anthem.
[01:19:14.747 --> 01:19:16.348]  I'm an American myself.
[01:19:16.348 --> 01:19:19.189]  And the flag is not just, you know, a joke symbol.
[01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:24.952]  The first thing that happens in the Middle East when they're anti-American is they burn this flag.
[01:19:24.952 --> 01:19:26.372]  Like, this is a big deal.
[01:19:26.372 --> 01:19:29.754]  The flag, especially in relation to America, more than almost any other country,
[01:19:30.074 --> 01:19:30.835]  Tommy Ranger.
[01:19:30.835 --> 01:19:32.636]  And you know, you know they're persecuting him.
[01:19:32.636 --> 01:19:33.037]  A lot of courage.
[01:19:33.037 --> 01:19:33.417]  Stay there.
[01:19:33.417 --> 01:19:34.598]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:34.598 --> 01:19:34.938]  Powerful.
[01:19:55.043 --> 01:19:56.723]  Do you trust our economy?
[01:19:56.723 --> 01:19:58.404]  How about our banking system?
[01:19:58.404 --> 01:20:05.606]  Our president has stated we are sitting on a bubble right now, and that when the Fed raises interest rates, bad things are going to happen.
[01:20:05.606 --> 01:20:07.967]  Well, the Fed is raising rates here and now.

[01:24:17.202 --> 01:24:25.790]  we're here live and I tell you somebody who I'd love to get on my broadcast, Paul Watson's, David Knight's, The War Room, is Andrew Tate.
[01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:30.974]  Not just on this subject, I mean on so many subjects because now I'm gonna actually watch some of his other interviews with other folks.
[01:24:30.974 --> 01:24:34.857]  He's really a smart guy and he's also a multi-time world champion kickboxer.
[01:24:36.259 --> 01:24:49.955]  So you can find out more about him at tateshinkai.net and you can also find him on Twitter, Facebook, you name it, at Cobra Tate.
[01:24:49.955 --> 01:24:54.900]  The reason I'm obsessing on this, we've got a longer segment coming up here in a moment, this is a short six minute segment, is
[01:24:56.238 --> 01:24:59.259]  I used to kind of, you know, just get sick of all the flag stuff.
[01:24:59.259 --> 01:25:00.060]  I love America.
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:00.760]  It's great.
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:10.124]  But I thought, you know, America is the Bill of Rights Constitution and people that fought for the country and people that have worked hard and have been good folks, you know, the flag itself, I didn't worship it.
[01:25:10.124 --> 01:25:14.166]  But at the same time, when it's under attack, that means the country is.
[01:25:14.166 --> 01:25:16.107]  And it's by a bunch of babies that don't even
[01:25:17.318 --> 01:25:36.054]  They want to stay here and get rich in the country, while a bunch of poor people go pay to watch him play, and then they're saying all the whites are racist when most of their fans are white, and it's just, it's sick, it's crazy, it's bizarre, it's upside down, and then the NFL's doubling down, saying we stand in solidarity with our players, even as their ratings plunge.
[01:25:36.054 --> 01:25:38.876]  Why are they doing this, even though it financially hurts them?
[01:25:38.876 --> 01:25:39.617]  What is the point?
[01:25:40.865 --> 01:25:41.986]  Yeah, I completely agree with you.
[01:25:41.986 --> 01:25:42.446]  It's crazy.
[01:25:42.446 --> 01:25:51.954]  And you know, this is off the tangent as well, but these guys don't realize how much damage they do, not only to the NFL, but also to the credibility of America as a whole.
[01:25:51.954 --> 01:25:53.195]  America has a lot of enemies.
[01:25:53.195 --> 01:25:54.736]  We're all aware of that.
[01:25:54.736 --> 01:25:55.857]  I mean, I'll tell you a quick story.
[01:25:55.857 --> 01:26:01.061]  I was in China fighting, and when I was in China, they kept me in this hotel, almost locked off from the real world.
[01:26:01.061 --> 01:26:02.562]  And I was watching Chinese news.
[01:26:03.163 --> 01:26:08.792]  And Chinese news is just a long series of everything bad that's happened in the West.
[01:26:08.792 --> 01:26:09.874]  And they just talk about it.
[01:26:09.874 --> 01:26:13.500]  Like, every protest, every terrorist attack, and they just talk about it.
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:17.807]  I didn't understand the Chinese, but it was basically, look what's happening over there, aren't you glad you're here?
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:22.003]  And it shows that there's a lot of other countries that look to America.
[01:26:22.003 --> 01:26:31.875]  And when they see these people who are millionaires, like you said, because of the American system, with white fans sitting there, disrespecting their entire country.
[01:26:31.875 --> 01:26:33.576]  This has repercussions all around the world.
[01:26:33.576 --> 01:26:35.539]  This damages the credibility of America as a whole.
[01:26:36.099 --> 01:26:39.320]  And these people have completely benefited from the American system.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:42.342]  It's the biggest slap in the face I've ever seen.
[01:26:42.342 --> 01:26:54.046]  It'd be like if I was black and most of my customers at a restaurant were white, and then I came and took a knee and said, I'm not going to sell you food because you're evil and you're white, and there are the white people there eating your food, paying you money.
[01:26:54.046 --> 01:26:54.767]  It's stupid!
[01:26:54.767 --> 01:26:56.687]  It's stupid.
[01:26:56.687 --> 01:26:57.668]  That's exactly the word.
[01:26:57.668 --> 01:26:58.608]  It's stupid.
[01:26:58.608 --> 01:27:00.529]  These people have nothing to complain about.
[01:27:00.529 --> 01:27:03.170]  They do not live lives worthy of complaint.
[01:27:03.757 --> 01:27:10.680]  There's not a single person on earth who wouldn't sign up to their kind of paycheck to play a game.
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.682]  And only in America are you going to make that kind of money to play a game.
[01:27:13.682 --> 01:27:16.403]  Like, you can't pull that off in many countries in the world.
[01:27:16.403 --> 01:27:18.684]  You can't disrespect the flag in many countries in the world.
[01:27:18.684 --> 01:27:24.627]  I was about to say, you can say what you want about Latin America or Asia or places, you do that to somebody's flag over there, they'll kill you.
[01:27:24.627 --> 01:27:29.089]  I mean, if you did that to the Mexican anthem in Mexico, they would beat the hell out of you, guaranteed.
[01:27:30.029 --> 01:27:30.990]  Absolutely.
[01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.470]  Absolutely.
[01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:36.192]  And these people are patriotic to their country and they don't even have the same benefits systematically.
[01:27:36.192 --> 01:27:39.493]  But at least they get it's their country and other people have been trying to take it over.
[01:27:39.493 --> 01:27:40.434]  At least there's a culture.
[01:27:41.345 --> 01:27:42.125]  Yeah.
[01:27:42.125 --> 01:27:43.666]  And America's falling apart now.
[01:27:43.666 --> 01:27:48.388]  And this will be the end of America when they divide people over these tiny crybaby issues.
[01:27:48.388 --> 01:27:52.470]  And liberals and less allow themselves to be influenced to this level.
[01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:59.813]  They allow some music star or some football player who has very little understanding of the real world.
[01:27:59.813 --> 01:28:03.095]  They allow them to just sit there and complain and cry.
[01:28:03.095 --> 01:28:05.456]  And a couple of their stupid fans buy into it.
[01:28:05.456 --> 01:28:07.096]  And they're just dividing the world.
[01:28:07.096 --> 01:28:09.657]  They're dividing the country among smart and stupid.
[01:28:09.657 --> 01:28:10.818]  And this is going to be the end of it all.
[01:28:11.318 --> 01:28:18.563]  When you have this large percentage of the population who are so easily triggered and upset over nothing, it's absolute insanity.
[01:28:18.563 --> 01:28:19.064]  It really is.
[01:28:19.064 --> 01:28:19.544]  It's crazy.
[01:28:20.407 --> 01:28:30.376]  You're right, and if you look at the WikiLeaks, it's the big elite saying, we're losing, the public's coming together, they're gonna want nationalism and free market, we don't want that, let's have culture war.
[01:28:30.376 --> 01:28:33.338]  They say, let's go to culture war, and they're doing it!
[01:28:33.338 --> 01:28:41.365]  The Hollywood's the elite, the NFL's the elite, and they're all backing this to try to turn us against each other, so the globalists can conquer America.
[01:28:41.365 --> 01:28:43.627]  That's what this is really about.
[01:28:43.627 --> 01:28:44.768]  Completely agree with you.
[01:28:44.768 --> 01:28:46.950]  There's not a single thing on Earth that happens
[01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:51.841]  In my view, without financial backing or a financial gain somewhere, or a power grab.
[01:28:51.841 --> 01:28:54.283]  This is a power grab like everything else, you know?
[01:28:54.283 --> 01:28:58.565]  And there's people who are in charge of this who know exactly what they're doing, and this is absolutely a power grab.
[01:28:58.565 --> 01:29:00.366]  Andrew Jay, is it gonna work?
[01:29:00.366 --> 01:29:02.347]  Is it gonna work, Andrew?
[01:29:02.347 --> 01:29:09.311]  I'd like to think that there's enough good Americans out there who understand that disrespecting the anthem and disrespecting the flag is unacceptable.
[01:29:09.944 --> 01:29:12.145]  I like to believe that that's the case.
[01:29:12.145 --> 01:29:21.089]  I think maybe you have some young impressionable idiots who want to buy into, you know, well, my hero said this, so I'm going to... But most adults with a brain should know better than to buy into this crap.
[01:29:21.089 --> 01:29:24.671]  Most adults know these are privileged crybabies.
[01:29:24.671 --> 01:29:27.172]  World champion kickboxer Andrew Tate, stay there.
[01:29:27.172 --> 01:29:29.733]  I want to come back and ask you then, what should we do?
[01:29:30.453 --> 01:29:32.114]  I mean, what should we do to really send a message?
[01:29:32.114 --> 01:29:33.275]  I know the boycott's exploding.
[01:29:33.275 --> 01:29:34.456]  Their ratings are plunging.
[01:29:34.456 --> 01:29:34.956]  What should we do?
[01:29:34.956 --> 01:29:37.638]  Then I want to get back into depression and a few other big issues with you.
[01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:39.579]  Then phone calls coming up after he leaves us.
[01:29:39.579 --> 01:29:40.539]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:29:40.539 --> 01:29:41.580]  This is the InfoWars.
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:44.282]  Spread the word.
[01:29:44.282 --> 01:29:45.663]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.663 --> 01:29:48.184]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.184 --> 01:29:50.886]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.164 --> 01:30:02.252]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com is writing about it.
[01:30:02.252 --> 01:30:11.505]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[01:30:11.505 --> 01:30:13.848]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh
[01:30:14.048 --> 01:30:15.229]  On the grasshoppers.
[01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:18.472]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune, if they can make money.
[01:30:18.472 --> 01:30:25.178]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[01:30:25.178 --> 01:30:29.642]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[01:30:29.642 --> 01:30:37.069]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[01:30:37.429 --> 01:30:45.893]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasion.
[01:30:45.893 --> 01:30:51.855]  Prepare for the worst-case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best-case scenario.

[01:30:54.737 --> 01:30:55.297]  I'm David Knight.

[01:31:49.102 --> 01:32:00.826]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:32:00.826 --> 01:32:11.169]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases,
[01:32:11.209 --> 01:32:11.469]  I think?
[01:32:29.969 --> 01:32:30.890]  We're good to go.
[01:33:02.381 --> 01:33:06.843]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news.
[01:33:06.843 --> 01:33:10.045]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[01:33:30.547 --> 01:33:32.789]  Andrew Tate's our guest, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:32.789 --> 01:33:44.818]  A multi-time world champion kickboxer in multiple top world leagues and a super smart guy who I just want to try to randomly get on on different topics to get his take here because he's really smart.
[01:33:44.818 --> 01:33:49.041]  You can also, where is the best place for people to follow what you're doing?
[01:33:49.041 --> 01:33:51.403]  At Cobra Tate on Twitter?
[01:33:51.403 --> 01:33:55.266]  Where's the best place for folks to check out all the things you're doing?
[01:33:55.266 --> 01:33:55.846]  Yeah, Twitter.
[01:33:55.846 --> 01:33:56.447]  Twitter, absolutely.
[01:33:59.352 --> 01:34:07.950]  I've been doing the talking here, but pulling back, just looking at the general atmosphere of all of this, if the NFL's main
[01:34:09.585 --> 01:34:33.840]  audience is conservatives and it's the American game how do you get away with attacking the anthem and demonizing America and saying it's white supremacist and all this ridiculous crap when minorities are now the majority in most areas are about to be the majority everywhere don't they get they're being cheated out of the birthright that okay you had the kids you help build the country if you're all in the demographics only when whites have stopped doing that
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:35.600]  I think that's absolutely correct.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.461]  And another thing, I think this has a large
[01:34:54.543 --> 01:34:59.047]  Uh, far to play in, is the absolute destruction of patriotism.
[01:34:59.047 --> 01:35:00.828]  Patriotism is extremely important.
[01:35:00.828 --> 01:35:03.130]  Nobody's gonna go to war and fight.
[01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:05.412]  Nobody's gonna even care about the street they live on.
[01:35:05.412 --> 01:35:08.755]  No one's gonna clean up after themselves if you have no patriotism.
[01:35:08.755 --> 01:35:11.057]  And to destroy patriotism at a ground level...
[01:35:11.497 --> 01:35:19.165]  That's exactly what this NFL garbage is about, to attack patriotism as a whole, and to try and create a country where people will just allow anything to go down.
[01:35:19.165 --> 01:35:23.890]  They don't care what happens for their future, they don't care what happens to their kids, they don't care what happens to the country.
[01:35:23.890 --> 01:35:30.036]  They'll just, oh, you know, I'm a person, I'm not necessarily an American, so however this goes down, it goes down.
[01:35:30.296 --> 01:35:31.998]  This is an absolute attack on patriotism.
[01:35:31.998 --> 01:35:36.925]  When you destroy patriotism, you no longer have the ability to create warriors in the name of your country.
[01:35:36.925 --> 01:35:40.670]  When you cannot create warriors for any reason, how can you last in the long term?
[01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:44.174]  Name one society since the dawn of time that survived without warriors.
[01:35:44.174 --> 01:35:45.156]  It's absolute madness!
[01:35:45.456 --> 01:35:48.118]  They're attacking patriotism as a whole, at the heart.
[01:35:48.118 --> 01:36:00.906]  And they think that by attacking patriotism and destroying it, they're going to be left with a populace who are just out for themselves, don't care about the country or the future of the country, and they can literally do anything they want, from a law-making perspective especially.
[01:36:00.906 --> 01:36:02.307]  And that's exactly where this comes down to.
[01:36:02.307 --> 01:36:08.651]  This is just about destroying people's national pride, so they can just ruin the country, make themselves rich, and go on their yacht in Monaco.
[01:36:08.651 --> 01:36:10.012]  They don't care about America.
[01:36:12.318 --> 01:36:17.100]  I'm going to tell you right now, I've been looking for somebody, and I don't tell other guests this.
[01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:18.080]  Everybody knows that watches.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:20.161]  When they say great stuff, I tell them, hey, I really agree with you.
[01:36:20.161 --> 01:36:30.205]  But somebody who has an innate instinct for what's happening, you definitely just have a way of crystallizing it and absolutely bring it to the fore right there.
[01:36:30.205 --> 01:36:32.186]  Because what you just said is total Veritas.
[01:36:32.186 --> 01:36:32.526]  That's it.
[01:36:33.126 --> 01:36:42.829]  And when you read their documents, I don't know if you have, they say we're demoralizing them to make them selfish little idiots that we control, knowing that that's going to turn everybody into slaves.
[01:36:42.829 --> 01:36:45.410]  But these little selfish idiots think they're getting ahead doing this.
[01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:53.373]  And I think getting on a media bandwagon and virtue signaling gives them power when they're blowing up the lifeboat they're sitting in.
[01:36:53.373 --> 01:36:54.553]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:36:54.553 --> 01:36:57.855]  And I think a lot of my experience comes from I've lived in a lot of different countries.
[01:36:57.855 --> 01:36:59.435]  I've traveled to a lot of different countries.
[01:36:59.435 --> 01:37:01.876]  And in Eastern Europe, where they're still very, very patriotic,
[01:37:02.609 --> 01:37:03.691]  None of this shit goes down.
[01:37:03.691 --> 01:37:11.305]  They don't have the immigrant problems, they don't have the terrorism problems, none of these problems because they say, if they try that in my country to my people, we'll do something instantly.
[01:37:11.795 --> 01:37:15.858]  Whereas if you look in Western Europe, where people have completely thrown patriotism away.
[01:37:15.858 --> 01:37:18.700]  If you're a soldier in England and you walk down the street, no one respects you.
[01:37:18.700 --> 01:37:21.602]  They look at you and think, well, why did he do that for that little money?
[01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:23.563]  Like, you're almost mocked for being a soldier.
[01:37:23.563 --> 01:37:25.084]  It's a stupid person's job.
[01:37:25.084 --> 01:37:31.288]  And this is exactly what they're trying to achieve in America, so they can do the same things they've done to Western Europe, which is flood it with immigrants.
[01:37:31.288 --> 01:37:34.771]  Wages never increase while prices have doubled in the last five years.
[01:37:34.771 --> 01:37:35.831]  Everyone's on the street.
[01:37:35.831 --> 01:37:36.952]  It's absolutely gone to hell.
[01:37:36.952 --> 01:37:38.233]  It's not safe anymore.
[01:37:38.233 --> 01:37:40.515]  And this is exactly what they're trying to do in America, the same thing.
[01:37:41.195 --> 01:37:49.762]  And let's be clear, they've exploited the third world, then they bring in the third world to exploit and destroy the first world because they want to hold everybody down, and they admit it.
[01:37:49.762 --> 01:37:50.823]  It's so cold-blooded.
[01:37:50.823 --> 01:37:59.350]  I mean, Apple contracts the worst factories on purpose, and it's come out that the factories go, just pay us enough, and we will give them better standards.
[01:37:59.350 --> 01:38:00.891]  We're getting heat on this.
[01:38:00.891 --> 01:38:04.154]  And Apple says, no, we want maximum profit.
[01:38:04.154 --> 01:38:10.118]  But because they say they're liberal, it's okay to have factories with forced drugging, forced abortion, and suicide nets.
[01:38:11.215 --> 01:38:17.117]  It's just crazy how evil liberals are, and here's an article Paul Watson wrote a year ago.
[01:38:17.117 --> 01:38:22.338]  New study confirms liberals are far more intolerant of other people's opinions, and it links to mainstream studies.
[01:38:22.338 --> 01:38:23.118]  There's a bunch of other studies.
[01:38:23.118 --> 01:38:34.581]  They're six times more likely to steal, nine times more likely not to give to charity, but like, what is this, 15 times or something, you have to read it, more likely to tell you they gave to charity, though.
[01:38:34.581 --> 01:38:36.622]  What they are is a bunch of fake pieces of crap.
[01:38:37.640 --> 01:38:39.801]  Absolutely, because they don't live in the real world.
[01:38:39.801 --> 01:38:45.683]  If you live in the real world with a logical mindset, it's near impossible to not think along a conservative line.
[01:38:45.683 --> 01:38:50.904]  If you live emotionally in some fairytale planet, then you're going to end up being a liberal.
[01:38:50.904 --> 01:38:53.325]  Because you cannot apply logic to a liberal mindset.
[01:38:53.325 --> 01:38:54.565]  It simply doesn't work.
[01:38:54.565 --> 01:38:59.627]  And the most dangerous thing about it is that this liberalism is spiraling out of control, especially in Western Europe.
[01:38:59.627 --> 01:39:01.468]  In Germany, the election just happened yesterday.
[01:39:01.468 --> 01:39:02.328]  Merkel got in again.
[01:39:02.868 --> 01:39:05.829]  How did Merkel get in again after all these terrorist attacks and refugee crises?
[01:39:05.829 --> 01:39:07.010]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[01:39:07.010 --> 01:39:10.071]  Every German I've spoken to did not vote for Merkel.
[01:39:10.071 --> 01:39:12.553]  Every single immigrant voted for Merkel.
[01:39:12.553 --> 01:39:13.373]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:39:13.373 --> 01:39:14.393]  This is what the liberals do.
[01:39:14.393 --> 01:39:17.735]  They allow... If you're an immigrant from a far-flung country...
[01:39:18.516 --> 01:39:23.661]  I mean, Democrats all over the US are legalizing illegals voting from California to Maryland.
[01:39:23.661 --> 01:39:26.204]  Then they tell you, oh, we don't want voter ID laws.
[01:39:26.204 --> 01:39:28.607]  It's a conspiracy that illegals are voting.
[01:39:28.607 --> 01:39:34.413]  The Democratic Party in Illinois passed a law to let them vote, but the governor couldn't sign it because it was a felony.
[01:39:35.234 --> 01:39:36.394]  That's absolutely right.
[01:39:36.394 --> 01:39:37.135]  This is what they're doing.
[01:39:37.135 --> 01:39:39.135]  And it's so pertinently obvious.
[01:39:39.135 --> 01:39:40.456]  And especially in Western Europe.
[01:39:40.456 --> 01:39:41.716]  America still has a chance.
[01:39:41.716 --> 01:39:43.877]  And I'm dual British and American.
[01:39:43.877 --> 01:39:49.678]  And when I see these kind of things like the NFL going down, I see exactly what they're trying to do by destroying patriotism in America.
[01:39:49.678 --> 01:39:52.819]  Because in Western Europe, there is no patriotism left.
[01:39:52.819 --> 01:39:55.060]  Terrorist attack after terrorist attack after terrorist attack.
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:57.380]  People have no sense of pride in their own people.
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:39:58.801]  Well, there's not even self-preservation!
[01:39:59.693 --> 01:40:00.814]  No, absolutely not!
[01:40:00.814 --> 01:40:02.176]  Everyone's out for themselves.
[01:40:02.176 --> 01:40:06.360]  Well, I didn't get hit by that truck, so it doesn't matter if other people from... They have no empathy.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:12.086]  So again, it's beyond nationalism's a form of empathy, that it's your country, like you said, you're connected.
[01:40:12.086 --> 01:40:18.533]  They take that away, it just, it brings in selfishness, and the millennials, not all of them, some of them are the best people out there, but...
[01:40:19.073 --> 01:40:21.675]  They are so damn selfish.
[01:40:21.675 --> 01:40:23.756]  But so many older folks are selfish too.
[01:40:23.756 --> 01:40:29.400]  It's just like, they think being selfish pigs, and by selfish, only caring about themselves gets them ahead.
[01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:30.021]  They're idiots!
[01:40:30.919 --> 01:40:31.819]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:31.819 --> 01:40:32.660]  Absolutely right.
[01:40:32.660 --> 01:40:35.181]  And they have zero interest in society as a whole.
[01:40:35.181 --> 01:40:37.101]  Zero interest in where their children are going to be raised.
[01:40:37.101 --> 01:40:41.423]  Zero interest in defend... Heaven forbid they had to defend the country they live in.
[01:40:41.423 --> 01:40:42.844]  Never in a million years.
[01:40:42.844 --> 01:40:46.025]  In Western Europe, they have a massive problem trying to even get anyone to join the military.
[01:40:46.025 --> 01:40:46.725]  No one wants to die.
[01:40:46.725 --> 01:40:47.585]  They have to have the U.S.
[01:40:47.585 --> 01:40:47.905]  come over.
[01:40:47.905 --> 01:40:48.786]  They have to have the U.S.
[01:40:48.786 --> 01:40:50.246]  and England come over and do it.
[01:40:50.246 --> 01:40:50.867]  The U.S.
[01:40:50.867 --> 01:40:53.087]  and England do like 75% of it.
[01:40:53.087 --> 01:40:55.468]  Because they can't even get men to go do it.
[01:40:55.468 --> 01:40:57.109]  The men don't even want to fight!
[01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.831]  Absolutely right.
[01:40:58.831 --> 01:41:06.656]  And then, then they want to criticize America for getting mixed up in everyone else's problems, when America is the only person who's capable of policing some of these psychos.
[01:41:06.656 --> 01:41:08.777]  And this goes on to North Korea, same thing.
[01:41:08.777 --> 01:41:11.079]  Everyone's saying, well why has America got a problem with North Korea?
[01:41:11.079 --> 01:41:16.062]  Who else is going to put their foot down and stop this guy before he has long-range nuclear weapons?
[01:41:16.062 --> 01:41:21.426]  You cannot, if you're going to engage him, and he's intent on war, you have two choices.
[01:41:21.426 --> 01:41:25.088]  You engage him before he has nuclear weapons, or after he has nuclear weapons.
[01:41:25.088 --> 01:41:25.949]  These are your two choices.
[01:41:26.089 --> 01:41:36.744]  And the Democrats and the Globalists gave him the nuclear weapons to appease, knowing what they were doing, and then now it's Trump's fault when he's saying, we will preemptively strike you, we're going to hit you.
[01:41:36.744 --> 01:41:38.947]  They're firing missiles every week over Japan.
[01:41:40.587 --> 01:41:43.409]  Let me ask that question.
[01:41:43.409 --> 01:41:45.010]  Talk about entitlement.
[01:41:45.010 --> 01:41:53.295]  Kim Jong-un, third generation dictator, royalty, he can hardly walk, he looks like a little pig demon, and he's up there shooting his mouth off the whole world.
[01:41:53.295 --> 01:41:54.376]  I don't want war.
[01:41:54.376 --> 01:41:56.157]  I've got four children.
[01:41:56.157 --> 01:42:02.661]  I know Russia and China could come in on this, but why the hell would Russia and China want to sit there and back North Korea when they're completely psychotic?
[01:42:04.685 --> 01:42:13.415]  North Korea, I think North Korea's motivations as a whole are simply because the only way that his regime retains power is by having a big, common, scary enemy.
[01:42:13.415 --> 01:42:13.955]  That's right.
[01:42:13.955 --> 01:42:17.039]  If America wasn't the enemy, he wouldn't have power anymore.
[01:42:17.039 --> 01:42:23.426]  His family retains power on fear, and the fear is that we're going to get invaded, we're going to get attacked, and we have to all stick together.
[01:42:23.426 --> 01:42:26.049]  And this is where his patriotism and his naturalism comes from.
[01:42:26.590 --> 01:42:28.532]  So, this is his motivations.
[01:42:28.532 --> 01:42:29.713]  He knows he has two choices.
[01:42:29.713 --> 01:42:36.439]  He either goads America, or his whole family loses their, he loses his position in the ruling class.
[01:42:36.439 --> 01:42:37.220]  So he decides to go to America.
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:37.640]  That's right.
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:43.305]  If he doesn't act vicious and evil and kill his own family members and launch missiles, those psycho generals below him will remove him.
[01:42:43.305 --> 01:42:45.227]  In fact, that's what the top analysts have said.
[01:42:45.227 --> 01:42:46.148]  You're dead on.
[01:42:46.148 --> 01:42:47.089]  It's incredible.
[01:42:47.089 --> 01:42:50.532]  And he doesn't get, though, the United States will strike them.
[01:42:50.532 --> 01:42:52.414]  And everybody else better get that through their head.
[01:42:52.981 --> 01:42:58.822]  Well, this is the difference, because when he was running his mouth and we had Obama, who, let's be honest, Obama wasn't worth much.
[01:42:58.822 --> 01:43:00.442]  He was nothing but a virtue-signaler himself.
[01:43:00.442 --> 01:43:05.603]  He liked to stand up there and play basketball and pretend he was a cool guy, but he wasn't man enough to do what needed to be done.
[01:43:05.603 --> 01:43:08.504]  It's easy to send threats at Obama all day, because Obama doesn't care.
[01:43:08.504 --> 01:43:10.144]  Obama's just going to roll over.
[01:43:10.144 --> 01:43:12.704]  Trump's man enough to say, look, enough of this.
[01:43:12.704 --> 01:43:14.005]  It's gone on long enough.
[01:43:14.005 --> 01:43:15.765]  You can't continue to threaten the world.
[01:43:15.765 --> 01:43:20.526]  You can't continue to progress a nuclear weapons program without there being some kind of serious repercussions.
[01:43:22.822 --> 01:43:24.363]  Absolutely right.
[01:43:24.363 --> 01:43:25.023]  Completely right.
[01:43:32.173 --> 01:43:40.799]  Bomber dry runs over the weekend over the DMZ to simulate dropping hydrogen bombs on the DMZ, which you have to wipe out of a war starts.
[01:43:40.799 --> 01:43:42.700]  That's where their main force is.
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:45.862]  This was to elicit the North shooting SAM missiles.
[01:43:45.862 --> 01:43:49.965]  And if they'd have done it when this happened Friday night, the war would have started.
[01:43:49.965 --> 01:43:57.830]  So that's why suddenly they're really freaking out because Trump is now basically asking them to fire the first shots.
[01:43:57.830 --> 01:44:00.112]  I hope North Korea is smart enough to back down right now.
[01:44:01.161 --> 01:44:02.301]  Yeah, so do I. Absolutely.
[01:44:02.301 --> 01:44:04.182]  Because it leads to the absolute destruction of the country.
[01:44:04.182 --> 01:44:05.862]  They don't stand a chance militarily.
[01:44:05.862 --> 01:44:10.524]  I think the number one, I think the people are going to suffer most from this war is probably the South Koreans.
[01:44:10.524 --> 01:44:12.424]  The South Koreans are going to take damage.
[01:44:12.424 --> 01:44:15.445]  The South Koreans are going to have a real, you know, hard time.
[01:44:15.445 --> 01:44:17.726]  And the South, South Korea itself is an amazing country.
[01:44:17.726 --> 01:44:23.348]  You have to remember when the North and South split in the 1950s, they both had the same GDP per capita as Yemen.
[01:44:23.348 --> 01:44:25.408]  And now South Korea is one of the richest countries in the world.
[01:44:25.408 --> 01:44:27.309]  60 years later, they've done amazing things.
[01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:32.153]  And they're going to suffer big time at the artillery shells and the short-range weaponry that North Korea has.
[01:44:32.153 --> 01:44:37.638]  And you notice, exactly, Trump just had this big meeting with the South Koreans and the Japanese.
[01:44:37.638 --> 01:44:39.639]  They're all in total unison giving the U.S.
[01:44:39.639 --> 01:44:42.682]  authorization and backing to launch even a preemptive strike.
[01:44:42.682 --> 01:44:45.504]  I just hope North Korea understands this isn't like the last 50 years.
[01:44:45.504 --> 01:44:47.946]  There's a loaded gun pointed right at their head.
[01:44:47.946 --> 01:44:50.929]  It's like Douglas MacArthur was president right back to 1953.
[01:44:50.929 --> 01:44:52.891]  I don't know they understand that.
[01:44:54.059 --> 01:44:54.980]  No, absolutely right.
[01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:56.601]  And this has to happen.
[01:44:56.601 --> 01:45:00.304]  If this regime is going to continue to test weapons in depth.
[01:45:00.304 --> 01:45:02.306]  Look, we've tried sanctions.
[01:45:02.306 --> 01:45:03.567]  We've tried condemning.
[01:45:03.567 --> 01:45:04.728]  They don't care.
[01:45:04.728 --> 01:45:06.289]  It doesn't matter how much you sanction him.
[01:45:06.289 --> 01:45:07.370]  He's never going to be hungry.
[01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:08.551]  His people will be hungry.
[01:45:08.551 --> 01:45:09.992]  And his people are brainwashed.
[01:45:09.992 --> 01:45:11.113]  He's still fat.
[01:45:11.113 --> 01:45:11.833]  He doesn't care.
[01:45:11.833 --> 01:45:12.874]  He has his food.
[01:45:12.874 --> 01:45:15.436]  So the sanctions aren't going to do a thing.
[01:45:15.436 --> 01:45:17.378]  He is intent on getting nuclear weapons.
[01:45:17.856 --> 01:45:18.697]  So you have two choices.
[01:45:18.697 --> 01:45:21.521]  You fight and you're man enough to do the preemptive strike.
[01:45:21.521 --> 01:45:28.969]  They either completely roll over, which is extremely unlikely, or we wait 10 years from now where they have the actual ability to nuke mainland America.
[01:45:28.969 --> 01:45:30.111]  Then you're in trouble.
[01:45:30.111 --> 01:45:32.574]  So now if there's going to be a war, it absolutely has to happen now.
[01:45:32.574 --> 01:45:36.118]  And I'm glad we have a man in the White House who's man enough to understand those realities.
[01:45:36.178 --> 01:45:38.719]  Well, I got a lot of top analysts that were against all these other wars.
[01:45:38.719 --> 01:45:39.960]  They say this one's real.
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:46.564]  That's why I'm backing whatever the president has to do because just 16 minutes ago, BBC, North Korea announced that the U.S.
[01:45:46.564 --> 01:45:47.264]  has declared war.
[01:45:47.264 --> 01:45:48.465]  They're now in a state of war.
[01:45:48.465 --> 01:45:49.546]  They're basically ending.
[01:45:49.546 --> 01:45:55.469]  They're announcing that they're ending the ceasefire of July 27th, 1953.
[01:45:55.469 --> 01:46:03.714]  So it looks like that these nuts want to go ahead and get a war going because they understand Trump is flying aircraft over North Korea now.
[01:46:03.714 --> 01:46:04.794]  So they want a war.
[01:46:04.794 --> 01:46:05.735]  I guess they're going to have to get it.
[01:46:07.152 --> 01:46:20.201]  Absolutely, and it's a good thing that American patriotism has not been destroyed yet, and we still have young men who are brave and honorable enough to go and get the job done, and they should be respected by the NFL brats who get paid far too much money to play a game.
[01:46:20.201 --> 01:46:23.423]  I really, it's almost angering that the world has gotten to this state.
[01:46:24.023 --> 01:46:33.408]  I don't know how we ended up where we've ended up, but 50 or 60 years ago, if you were to try and explain modern world problems to anyone back then, they'd be like, that's not how that works.
[01:46:33.408 --> 01:46:40.412]  If you told people 20 years ago they're going to be having all the players not come out to the National Anthem while we're almost at war with North Korea...
[01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:44.210]  It's crazy.
[01:46:44.210 --> 01:46:45.330]  It's absolutely crazy.
[01:46:45.330 --> 01:46:48.531]  And like you said, even only 20 years ago, people would not have stood for it.
[01:46:48.531 --> 01:46:57.814]  And now, we're in a situation where more and more people are just letting things slide, letting small freedoms slide, letting these blatant disrespects slide, thinking, oh, it's only a game.
[01:46:57.814 --> 01:46:59.154]  This is not only a game.
[01:46:59.154 --> 01:47:00.634]  This is patriotism of your country.
[01:47:00.634 --> 01:47:06.196]  Well, here's a question in closing for all the marbles, for our amazing guest, Mr. Tate.
[01:47:08.516 --> 01:47:10.039]  China and Russia.
[01:47:10.039 --> 01:47:13.324]  First, a month ago, they were signaling, hey, we're, you know, if the U.S.
[01:47:13.324 --> 01:47:15.307]  has hit North Korea, we're going to stand down.
[01:47:15.307 --> 01:47:19.033]  Now they're signaling China's like, no, we may do something.
[01:47:19.033 --> 01:47:19.874]  We kicked...
[01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:22.236]  The Japanese out of China.
[01:47:22.236 --> 01:47:25.098]  We even let them take over, let the Communists in.
[01:47:25.098 --> 01:47:26.640]  We've given them all our jobs.
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:27.601]  What the hell?
[01:47:27.601 --> 01:47:32.986]  I mean, you know, why would they have a nuclear war with us, even though we'll defeat them?
[01:47:32.986 --> 01:47:37.170]  I hope Russia stands down, because, I mean, this will end the planet.
[01:47:37.170 --> 01:47:38.031]  What is the problem?
[01:47:38.031 --> 01:47:39.232]  They need to back us.
[01:47:42.059 --> 01:47:43.440]  They absolutely should.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.382]  And everything in life is a power grab.
[01:47:45.382 --> 01:47:47.603]  They see the opportunity for a power grab.
[01:47:47.603 --> 01:47:50.866]  It's how it goes in business, it's how it goes in the world, how it goes in politics.
[01:47:50.866 --> 01:47:56.591]  They see America, not in a weakened state militarily, but we are in a weakened state as a people.
[01:47:56.591 --> 01:48:09.701]  For all the things you've been discussing in this show, I've watched the whole way through, when you have all these, this race war which is propagated by the left, these people who are playing a game and they don't want to respect their own flag, when they see the population of America no longer is unified,
[01:48:10.101 --> 01:48:13.642]  And they see the absolute divides, they see a chance for a power play.
[01:48:13.642 --> 01:48:17.723]  And this is why it's so important when I was saying things like the NFL, it's more than just a game.
[01:48:17.723 --> 01:48:21.064]  The Chinese are sitting there saying, most Americans don't even love America.
[01:48:21.064 --> 01:48:25.565]  You know, we can do this, we can pull this off, most Americans don't even care if America loses.
[01:48:25.565 --> 01:48:33.226]  And this is what they're broadcasting to the world, all these hip-hop stars and Hollywood celebrities who are constantly crying about Trump not respecting the leader of their country.
[01:48:33.226 --> 01:48:36.467]  This is the exact kind of problems they are bringing to our doorstep.
[01:48:37.127 --> 01:48:43.352]  If every single American was backing Trump, a strong leader, China would never for a second be... That's absolutely right.
[01:48:43.352 --> 01:48:48.516]  They know there's a fifth column of globalists, a fifth column of multinationals that are already allied with China.
[01:48:48.516 --> 01:48:53.280]  You got Lloyd Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, making fun of America, saying your infrastructure is going to fail.
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:54.081]  China's the future.
[01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:55.262]  This is tweets.
[01:48:55.262 --> 01:48:58.283]  I mean, they've sold out to these authoritarian regimes.
[01:48:58.283 --> 01:48:59.804]  They want authoritarianism here.
[01:48:59.804 --> 01:49:00.945]  They think we're a joke.
[01:49:00.945 --> 01:49:02.325]  They hate flyover country.
[01:49:02.325 --> 01:49:04.006]  They have no respect for anything.
[01:49:04.006 --> 01:49:07.668]  These globalists are destroying their own firewalls for nation states.
[01:49:07.668 --> 01:49:12.291]  And when things fall apart next time, there'll be no nation like America or others to come back and save them.
[01:49:12.291 --> 01:49:17.314]  They're so stupid and have forgot all these lessons, these corporate chiefs.
[01:49:17.314 --> 01:49:19.355]  And now they've appeased North Korea.
[01:49:19.355 --> 01:49:20.555]  Now it's coming to a head and
[01:49:22.211 --> 01:49:24.573]  It's just, it's total megalomania.
[01:49:24.573 --> 01:49:25.974]  It's an incredible time to be alive.
[01:49:25.974 --> 01:49:29.597]  Andrew Tate, thank you so much for spending all this time with us.
[01:49:29.597 --> 01:49:32.519]  People can follow you there on Twitter, and they should, at Cobra Tate.
[01:49:32.519 --> 01:49:35.181]  I want to invite you to call the producer anytime you want to come on.
[01:49:35.181 --> 01:49:37.303]  I'd like to invite you on routinely to be a commentator.
[01:49:37.303 --> 01:49:38.764]  You're a really, really amazing guy.
[01:49:38.764 --> 01:49:40.425]  Thank you so much, and God bless you.
[01:49:40.425 --> 01:49:43.367]  Just the minute we have left, I know you're semi-retired right now.
[01:49:43.367 --> 01:49:47.050]  I guess all fighters that are already world champion three or four times in a row do that.
[01:49:47.050 --> 01:49:48.892]  But what are you working on these days?
[01:49:49.909 --> 01:49:50.870]  Well, thank you very much, sir.
[01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:59.477]  I appreciate it, and I always stay in tune with your information and your network, and you do a fantastic job battling against the fake news we've exposed time and time again.
[01:49:59.477 --> 01:50:02.179]  Nowadays, I travel Europe a lot.
[01:50:02.179 --> 01:50:03.200]  I learn a lot of things.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:07.263]  I go all around the world, and I just keep myself to myself at the moment.
[01:50:07.263 --> 01:50:12.828]  I try not to upset too many people with the truth, but really, you're doing a fantastic job, Alex, and I'd love to be a guest again.
[01:50:12.828 --> 01:50:13.148]  All right.
[01:50:13.148 --> 01:50:14.229]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.750]  Andrew Tate.
[01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:21.371]  Wow, okay, we're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and I always say I'm going to give the number out and I never get to your calls because there's so much to cover.
[01:50:21.371 --> 01:50:23.532]  We got so much other breaking news.
[01:50:23.532 --> 01:50:30.654]  I've got four children and this country's not perfect but it's so much better than most of the other nations.
[01:50:30.654 --> 01:50:44.617]  99% and we're under such attack and Russia's under attack because it's sovereign and being nationalistic now and I just, to see these idiots siding against the country when we're trying to relaunch and reboot the country while we're under total attack and everything's on the line here.
[01:50:46.024 --> 01:50:52.905]  Forget Super Bowl stuff, this is for the big game of life, and they got these idiots that don't know which side to be on, and it makes me angry.
[01:50:55.370 --> 01:50:57.432]  North Korea openly threatens the U.S.
[01:50:57.432 --> 01:50:59.333]  and launches a new missile every other week.
[01:50:59.333 --> 01:51:00.574]  Their warhead of choice?
[01:51:00.574 --> 01:51:02.015]  Electromagnetic pulse.
[01:51:02.015 --> 01:51:03.496]  Such an event would cripple the U.S.
[01:51:03.496 --> 01:51:05.958]  power grid for years and leave millions in the dark.
[01:51:05.958 --> 01:51:06.639]  Are you ready?

[01:51:54.491 --> 01:51:59.193]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:51:59.193 --> 01:52:12.159]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:52:12.159 --> 01:52:18.801]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:52:18.801 --> 01:52:22.203]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have
[01:52:22.423 --> 01:52:32.685]  Concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.

[01:53:26.322 --> 01:53:27.103]  Not true.
[01:53:27.103 --> 01:53:28.924]  Actually, you are what you can absorb.
[01:53:28.924 --> 01:53:32.887]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?

[01:54:05.686 --> 01:54:10.589]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:54:10.589 --> 01:54:15.451]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:54:15.451 --> 01:54:20.674]  Well, about 25 minutes ago North Korea said the U.S.
[01:54:20.674 --> 01:54:22.295]  has already declared war on it.
[01:54:23.522 --> 01:54:29.388]  No, when North Korea says we will preemptively nuke America, we will attack you imminently, it's going to happen.
[01:54:29.388 --> 01:54:41.802]  You've got a gun pointed at us, and we've been appeasing you forever, and you've been grabbing US ships, and grabbing South Korean ships, and grabbing Japanese ships, and your people are abject total slaves, and millions have died in forced labor camps.
[01:54:43.916 --> 01:54:49.679]  My prejudice against North Korea is that it's a horrible, vile, communist, murderous state.
[01:54:49.679 --> 01:54:55.181]  Per capita, the most oppressive, murderous country in world history.
[01:54:55.181 --> 01:54:57.302]  Hitler killed 20 million people.
[01:54:57.302 --> 01:55:02.165]  Communists killed, in Russia, over 100 million off and on and in satellites.
[01:55:02.165 --> 01:55:05.886]  Communist China, 84 million, they say, died under Mao.
[01:55:05.886 --> 01:55:07.367]  That's the communist's own numbers.
[01:55:07.367 --> 01:55:08.548]  The CIA says it's 65 million.
[01:55:10.290 --> 01:55:14.233]  So I have no respect for North Korea and the bloodsuckers that run it.
[01:55:14.233 --> 01:55:16.394]  And South Korea is a quasi-free country.
[01:55:16.394 --> 01:55:17.655]  They got their own issues.
[01:55:17.655 --> 01:55:20.557]  And they've got hundreds of times the wealth.
[01:55:20.557 --> 01:55:22.318]  They're one of the richest countries in the world.
[01:55:22.318 --> 01:55:27.721]  They were nothing but rice paddies 60 years ago.
[01:55:27.721 --> 01:55:29.302]  My sister's Korean adopted.
[01:55:29.302 --> 01:55:30.263]  Love her to death.
[01:55:30.263 --> 01:55:33.125]  She's my family.
[01:55:33.125 --> 01:55:34.626]  I don't want to see a bunch of Asians die.
[01:55:35.987 --> 01:55:41.309]  And I get Ron Paul says we should leave North Korea alone and this is an escalation and all the rest of it.
[01:55:41.309 --> 01:55:47.352]  North Korea is the one running around pushing their fat mouth.
[01:55:47.352 --> 01:55:48.453]  And I get when there's tension.
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:51.101]  There's weapon sales.
[01:55:51.101 --> 01:55:54.842]  And I get Japan and South Korea just spent hundreds of billions more on weapons.
[01:55:54.842 --> 01:55:56.163]  But here's something else.
[01:55:56.163 --> 01:56:02.146]  The Japanese, the Koreans, the Chinese, and the Vietnamese have been killing each other 24-7 for thousands of years.
[01:56:02.146 --> 01:56:05.727]  That's why all these ignorant morons that think the whole world's black and white.
[01:56:05.727 --> 01:56:09.669]  In the Middle East, different Muslim groups hate each other way more than they hate Christians.
[01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:17.572]  You go to Asia, the Japanese and the Chinese hate each other to a level unimaginable.
[01:56:17.572 --> 01:56:18.613]  Same thing with the Koreans.
[01:56:19.878 --> 01:56:23.381]  Have been invaded and controlled by China over and over again, and by the Japanese.
[01:56:23.381 --> 01:56:28.306]  They hate each other, and it's a bunch of ongoing craziness.
[01:56:28.306 --> 01:56:32.430]  North Korea's been appeased, they've been given everything, and they don't stop!
[01:56:32.430 --> 01:56:36.354]  Kim Jong-un needs to go away!
[01:56:36.354 --> 01:56:42.139]  The North Korean elite needs to remove his ass, and then you can have a project to move out of communism.
[01:56:42.139 --> 01:56:44.822]  But you don't want to turn loose of it, you dirtbags!
[01:56:48.390 --> 01:56:51.253]  That's why Joel Skousen was against all these wars.
[01:56:51.253 --> 01:56:53.636]  He's a smart guy.
[01:56:53.636 --> 01:56:58.701]  Marine Corps officer, naval aviator in Vietnam, he'll tell you, no, this is real, we gotta back the President.
[01:56:58.701 --> 01:57:00.042]  This is real.
[01:57:00.042 --> 01:57:01.964]  This is real.
[01:57:01.964 --> 01:57:06.790]  And I'm just telling you, if we hit him, we need to knock him absolutely back to hell.
[01:57:07.853 --> 01:57:09.454]  And crush those communists!
[01:57:09.454 --> 01:57:12.615]  And the argument's gonna be, and I heard it in the control room by some smart folks, guys, what they thought.
[01:57:12.615 --> 01:57:14.375]  You know, I don't run a cult here.
[01:57:14.375 --> 01:57:15.056]  You gotta agree with me.
[01:57:15.056 --> 01:57:21.158]  They're like, listen, we'll be the only country that's twice, you know, dropped nuclear weapons on people.
[01:57:21.158 --> 01:57:23.659]  Actually, three times, but you have the second round.
[01:57:23.659 --> 01:57:28.080]  And so people may preemptively attack us, because all these agreements and stuff will be out the door.
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:30.101]  Mutually Assured Destruction's already out the door.
[01:57:32.082 --> 01:57:33.623]  Everybody's getting nuclear weapons.
[01:57:33.623 --> 01:57:37.204]  They'll fear us and won't use nuclear weapons, and won't push us.
[01:57:37.204 --> 01:57:38.965]  That's what'll happen.
[01:57:38.965 --> 01:57:56.711]  If Russia and China don't join North Korea in a full-scale nuclear war, and then all our problems will be solved, and all those little whiny people, bitching and complaining, hating America, inviting certain destruction, stuck on their thumbs because they only made 200 million dollars, well, they're gonna have a big, fast express elevator to whatever god they worship, won't they?
[01:57:59.172 --> 01:58:00.793]  They don't worship anything but being dumbasses.
[01:58:00.793 --> 01:58:06.216]  They worship the God of Boxer Rocks.
[01:58:06.216 --> 01:58:10.298]  We have two new specials because we're ending the other specials.
[01:58:10.298 --> 01:58:12.199]  Secret 12, The Amazing Mythical Bottleman.
[01:58:14.139 --> 01:58:14.659]  40% off.
[01:58:14.659 --> 01:58:15.640]  Never done that.
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:18.180]  Alexa Pure Water Filtration Systems are 20% off.
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:18.780]  They're excellent.
[01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:20.821]  Alexa Pure Breeze, 20% off.
[01:58:20.821 --> 01:58:22.801]  It's a limited time offer.
[01:58:22.801 --> 01:58:27.462]  And we're ending today the 50% off on high quality storable foods from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:58:27.462 --> 01:58:30.263]  The entire spectrum of foods, a true 50% off.
[01:58:30.263 --> 01:58:31.303]  And it ships within days.
[01:58:31.303 --> 01:58:35.004]  Fresh, high quality, last 25 years as proprietary packaging.

[01:58:40.385 --> 01:58:42.106]  And I suggest you also spread the links.
[01:58:42.106 --> 01:58:42.846]  We're in a total war.
[01:58:46.067 --> 01:58:53.529]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:58:53.529 --> 01:59:06.732]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[01:59:07.672 --> 01:59:19.578]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[01:59:19.578 --> 01:59:25.521]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[01:59:26.281 --> 01:59:35.308]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[01:59:35.308 --> 01:59:47.917]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[01:59:47.917 --> 01:59:50.579]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:21.132 --> 02:00:27.633]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:00:27.633 --> 02:00:31.914]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.914 --> 02:00:46.938]  David Horowitz to talk about the latest loving jihad attacks that have been visited upon us.
[02:00:46.938 --> 02:00:48.178]  He's going to be joining us.
[02:00:49.929 --> 02:00:55.233]  And then Matt Dubiel is going to be hosting the 4th Hour, our great Chicago affiliate.
[02:00:55.233 --> 02:00:58.575]  He's got some really exciting announcements coming soon.
[02:00:58.575 --> 02:01:03.819]  But before we go any further, we should pray for peace.
[02:01:03.819 --> 02:01:06.621]  We should pray for awakening.
[02:01:06.621 --> 02:01:09.243]  We should pray for repentance.
[02:01:09.243 --> 02:01:12.325]  We should really seek God's face right now, all of us.
[02:01:12.325 --> 02:01:14.847]  I've been really stressed out myself.
[02:01:14.847 --> 02:01:17.729]  The politicization of everything that's going on is a nightmare.
[02:01:20.010 --> 02:01:27.133]  And as disgusting and stupid as the spoiled brat NFL system is, they're just buying into the hype.
[02:01:27.133 --> 02:01:37.798]  They're just folks that grew up in front of television in their crap-filled diapers, and mama wasn't there, and they got little shrunken brains, like a lot of the public.
[02:01:37.798 --> 02:01:48.282]  You gotta realize, these are zombies, and they just buy into whatever they hear is cool, and these are the folks that won the lottery to be in the NFL, and they don't even get that in their bitching.
[02:01:51.015 --> 02:01:58.761]  And then they're going to bitch and complain later when they got brain damage and wonder what they signed up for.
[02:01:58.761 --> 02:02:00.222]  But North Korea accuses the U.S.
[02:02:00.222 --> 02:02:00.943]  of declaring war.
[02:02:00.943 --> 02:02:02.905]  That's all coming up.
[02:02:02.905 --> 02:02:04.506]  We're also getting Roger Stone popping in.
[02:02:04.506 --> 02:02:07.969]  He's testifying tomorrow on the whole stupid Russiagate thing.
[02:02:07.969 --> 02:02:11.471]  That's going to be closed so they can lie about what he really said.
[02:02:11.471 --> 02:02:13.113]  But you're going to get here exclusively.
[02:02:14.909 --> 02:02:18.250]  Before he testifies, his statement.
[02:02:18.250 --> 02:02:21.371]  So that they can't just ignore what he really said and make up lies.
[02:02:21.371 --> 02:02:23.871]  Because they've been doing that using these closed sessions.
[02:02:23.871 --> 02:02:26.512]  They're scared to have these Russian things out in the open.
[02:02:26.512 --> 02:02:32.674]  Because they're getting their clocks cleaned during them.
[02:02:32.674 --> 02:02:33.474]  Here's a report.
[02:02:33.474 --> 02:02:34.894]  Boycott the National Anthem.
[02:02:34.894 --> 02:02:38.275]  Boycott the NFL that Derrick McBrain put together a month ago.
[02:02:40.046 --> 02:02:41.947]  that gets into all of this.
[02:02:41.947 --> 02:02:43.848]  So I want to air this piece here in a moment.
[02:02:43.848 --> 02:02:47.831]  Boycott the National Anthem or Boycott the NFL.
[02:02:47.831 --> 02:02:53.414]  Here's that report and we'll be right back with David Horowitz.
[02:02:53.414 --> 02:02:57.437]  And we're also going to have a bunch of clips with Pelosi and more.
[02:02:57.437 --> 02:02:57.737]  Here it is.
[02:03:07.116 --> 02:03:11.580]  It's being called the largest national anthem protest yet in the National Football League.
[02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:18.165]  Overnight, a wave of NFL members joining Colin Kaepernick's protest against racism and police brutality.
[02:03:18.165 --> 02:03:21.907]  If you ain't got the respect for the flag, stay in your locker room.
[02:03:21.907 --> 02:03:25.270]  You know, I am beyond angry.
[02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.970]  It's my fault.
[02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:27.151]  I was a little bit late.
[02:03:27.151 --> 02:03:32.195]  We're gonna, we're gonna come out of the next segment playing that.
[02:03:33.490 --> 02:03:36.012]  Because it just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[02:03:36.012 --> 02:03:39.054]  One of the most profound things ever.
[02:03:39.054 --> 02:03:48.001]  Out of everything they're doing, out of everything this is about, you ask why these idiots would play along with this when it's so stupid and it hit me, why?
[02:03:48.001 --> 02:03:49.021]  It hit me.
[02:03:49.021 --> 02:03:54.405]  Why they themselves go along with it.
[02:03:54.405 --> 02:03:55.146]  And it's because
[02:03:57.654 --> 02:03:59.095]  Well, I'll tell you after the break.
[02:03:59.095 --> 02:04:00.856]  And I'm sure you already got this.
[02:04:00.856 --> 02:04:04.878]  I always miss the biggest, simple things, and I find the little things, you know, the little side issues.
[02:04:04.878 --> 02:04:06.079]  And that's good.
[02:04:06.079 --> 02:04:16.705]  I look deeply into things, but sometimes I look so deeply to who's creating it and who's behind it, instead of looking at why does the average dumbass go along with this?
[02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:21.681]  And it really hit me like a ton of bricks.
[02:04:21.681 --> 02:04:22.502]  Now I'm totally clear.
[02:04:22.502 --> 02:04:25.243]  So after the segment, we'll get into that and more.
[02:04:25.243 --> 02:04:27.645]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:04:27.645 --> 02:04:30.066]  Both sites have some different news, but a lot of the same news.
[02:04:30.066 --> 02:04:32.768]  But Newswars.com loads really fast.
[02:04:32.768 --> 02:04:33.809]  It's a newer site design.
[02:04:33.809 --> 02:04:34.569]  We're tweaking it.
[02:04:34.569 --> 02:04:36.830]  It's kind of a test for a redesign of Infowars coming up.
[02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:39.072]  That's why I'm really proud of Newswars.com.
[02:04:39.072 --> 02:04:41.733]  It's got a lot of big breaking news up on it as well.
[02:04:41.733 --> 02:04:42.634]  That's all coming up.
[02:04:42.634 --> 02:04:44.635]  And then the North Korea accuses the U.S.
[02:04:44.635 --> 02:04:46.036]  of declaring war.
[02:04:46.036 --> 02:04:47.176]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:47.176 --> 02:04:47.797]  Please stay with us.
[02:04:52.122 --> 02:05:05.168]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[02:05:06.482 --> 02:05:18.466]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[02:05:18.466 --> 02:05:34.732]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[02:05:35.212 --> 02:05:38.795]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming.
[02:05:38.795 --> 02:05:40.196]  It's already here.
[02:05:40.196 --> 02:05:44.440]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:46.161]  Infowars.com
[02:05:52.373 --> 02:05:56.136]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[02:05:56.136 --> 02:06:03.881]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[02:06:03.881 --> 02:06:12.507]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[02:06:12.507 --> 02:06:16.910]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:06:16.910 --> 02:06:22.053]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[02:06:22.093 --> 02:06:22.433]  We're good.
[02:06:51.130 --> 02:06:59.394]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[02:06:59.394 --> 02:07:00.614]  A 360 win.
[02:07:00.614 --> 02:07:07.177]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:07:07.177 --> 02:07:14.700]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:20.182]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.

[02:07:54.134 --> 02:08:04.278]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:08:04.278 --> 02:08:06.859]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:06.859 --> 02:08:09.640]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:14.511]  I always tend to look at where things come from.
[02:08:14.511 --> 02:08:15.211]  Who's behind it?
[02:08:15.211 --> 02:08:16.612]  Who's pushing it?
[02:08:16.612 --> 02:08:18.433]  Who's using crises to get more power?
[02:08:18.433 --> 02:08:22.775]  I tend to look at the command and control system instead of who's being targeted.
[02:08:22.775 --> 02:08:32.780]  Why would players from at least four different teams yesterday, in some cases, unanimously stay in their locker rooms?
[02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:35.462]  And why would they see it as okay to go out and
[02:08:37.435 --> 02:08:38.936]  Rub it in to the veterans.
[02:08:38.936 --> 02:08:45.321]  Rub it in to the patriots, to the families, to the folks that lost loved ones or people that lost limbs.
[02:08:45.321 --> 02:08:54.367]  Why would they see it as okay when you're supposed to virtually signal to every foreign country and every other religion and every other group but Christians and Americans?
[02:08:54.367 --> 02:09:02.893]  Just like this guy over the weekend that went in and shot eight people, was a black nationalist Muslim from Sudan who wanted to kill white Christians.
[02:09:02.893 --> 02:09:04.694]  You'll never even hear about him again by tomorrow.
[02:09:06.894 --> 02:09:10.137]  Why was it okay?
[02:09:10.137 --> 02:09:17.903]  It's okay because they've been taught that the media is going to tell you you're good if you hate on America, but don't hate on anybody else.
[02:09:17.903 --> 02:09:32.276]  Because think about this, when they went to that exhibition game for two American teams this weekend, they're now calling the anthem white supremacist.
[02:09:32.276 --> 02:09:33.397]  It's about getting rid of America.
[02:09:34.588 --> 02:09:48.295]  And we know that while this was all going on, they then stood for the God Save Our Queen event.
[02:09:48.295 --> 02:09:51.457]  So see, they thought, oh, we won't get patted on the head for this.
[02:09:51.457 --> 02:09:54.358]  We haven't been told to go out and do this.
[02:09:54.358 --> 02:09:57.840]  So we're going to stand for God Save the Queen.
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:09:59.061]  It's just America we hate.
[02:09:59.932 --> 02:10:05.369]  And it's because they're a bunch of followers that have been told to do it by their PR people, by their managers.
[02:10:05.369 --> 02:10:06.693]  It's why the owners are behind it.
[02:10:08.311 --> 02:10:23.436]  Because the owners of the NFL are all part of the Hollywood elite, they're all part of the establishment, and the NFL has been bullied and blackmailed by the Justice Department because of all the gladiatorial payoffs, people getting paid to hurt folks, the concussions.
[02:10:23.436 --> 02:10:33.199]  They've been told, if you'll be our political arm, we won't sue you, we won't indict you, we won't come after you, when all these teams have been caught engaging in that type of behavior.
[02:10:35.799 --> 02:10:43.587]  So you tell your players to do it, and the players go out and do it because they've been told to, but also because they're narcissists.
[02:10:43.587 --> 02:10:49.533]  And they want to not be about the flag or the veterans or America or our shared unity or patriotism.
[02:10:49.533 --> 02:10:54.598]  They want to make it all about themselves.
[02:10:54.598 --> 02:10:57.281]  And that's what's really sickening, how they're grandstanding.
[02:10:57.281 --> 02:10:57.561]  It's like
[02:10:58.464 --> 02:10:59.705]  Go into somebody's funeral.
[02:10:59.705 --> 02:11:03.247]  When they're talking about the eulogy, you stand up and start talking about yourself.
[02:11:03.247 --> 02:11:04.749]  Because that's what the flag is.
[02:11:04.749 --> 02:11:09.312]  It's a symbol of all those people that died for the belief in the country.
[02:11:09.312 --> 02:11:10.613]  And we're an amazing country!
[02:11:12.401 --> 02:11:16.346]  Nobody'd go to North Korea and do that, because they'd put you in a death camp.
[02:11:16.346 --> 02:11:18.829]  You wouldn't go to Mexico and do that, because they'd kick your ass.
[02:11:18.829 --> 02:11:22.574]  But it's okay to do it here, because we're so oppressive, you're allowed to get away with it.
[02:11:22.574 --> 02:11:24.676]  No, they use our openness against us.
[02:11:24.676 --> 02:11:27.480]  We're going to David Horowitz as soon as we get him on the sky.
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:31.105]  But here is a little piece Derren McBrain put together that lays this all out.
[02:11:32.110 --> 02:11:33.711]  So they're not just chumps.
[02:11:33.711 --> 02:11:40.596]  They're attention whores that think following Hollywood and the elite's directives is cool, and they got ordered to do it.
[02:11:40.596 --> 02:11:42.117]  They're mercenaries.
[02:11:42.117 --> 02:11:51.104]  Globalist, foreign mercenaries now, literally trying to demoralize and bring down the country, which the Cloward and Piven documents all show.
[02:11:51.104 --> 02:11:52.925]  That's why they're bringing in the Islamicists.
[02:11:52.925 --> 02:11:56.068]  This is a true assault to bring down the country.
[02:12:01.124 --> 02:12:10.753]  It's being called the largest national anthem protest yet in the National Football League.
[02:12:10.753 --> 02:12:17.299]  Overnight, a wave of NFL members joining Colin Kaepernick's protest against racism and police brutality.
[02:12:17.299 --> 02:12:20.062]  If you ain't got the respect for the flag, stay in your locker room.
[02:12:22.691 --> 02:12:24.432]  I am beyond angry.
[02:12:24.432 --> 02:12:39.084]  I am saddened and I am ashamed that my nation, the United States of America, your nation, is absolutely filled with entitled, spoiled brat babies like Colin Kaepernick.
[02:12:39.084 --> 02:12:41.666]  I think the coaches should be kicking somebody in the butt.
[02:12:42.186 --> 02:12:49.588]  Why does the left only rush to defend someone's right to free speech when they're using it to trash America?
[02:12:49.588 --> 02:12:56.891]  And he sits there whining and bitching and talking about how America is the most evil, racist country in the world.
[02:12:58.051 --> 02:12:59.313]  Talk about insanity.
[02:12:59.313 --> 02:13:04.999]  Hundreds of Colin Kaepernick fans are protesting in New York in support of the former 49er quarterback.
[02:13:04.999 --> 02:13:08.843]  They're upset that he does not have a team to play for this season.
[02:13:08.843 --> 02:13:13.547]  He was met with thousands of boos after he praised Fidel Castro.
[02:13:50.458 --> 02:13:59.705]  Yeah, I forgot, Kaepernick praised Fidel Castro, who killed at least half a million of his own people and stole everybody's wealth, and now the country's a hellhole, and you don't even go live there.
[02:13:59.705 --> 02:14:08.231]  You just have your little leftist, social justice warrior, white parents that adopted you and taught you to hate America.
[02:14:08.231 --> 02:14:11.893]  See, Kaepernick's a victim of his leftist brainwashing.
[02:14:11.893 --> 02:14:19.759]  Alright, we got David Horowitz a little bit late because of his Skype problems, but it's great to have him with us just to get into all this breaking.
[02:14:21.074 --> 02:14:28.478]  Uh, the church shooter in Tennessee is a black power radical who posted online, you're more likely to be killed by a white man.
[02:14:28.478 --> 02:14:32.660]  He's also a Muslim, uh, out of Sudan.
[02:14:34.258 --> 02:14:37.479]  But that's okay, you're not hearing anything about Muslims being involved in terror attacks right now.
[02:14:37.479 --> 02:14:40.839]  Because it's okay, it was just a bunch of white people that got shot.
[02:14:40.839 --> 02:14:44.440]  We got to end that Second Amendment or he would have been able to protect himself.
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:52.881]  London Mayor Khan compares President Trump to ISIS, even though Khan is an Islamicist, who says just get used to terror attacks, and that's their hope.
[02:14:52.881 --> 02:14:57.762]  I always thought they let them out with these terror attacks, that we get sick of it and stop it.
[02:14:57.762 --> 02:14:58.662]  Oh no no!
[02:14:58.662 --> 02:15:01.603]  Khan says get used to it, they believe you'll just submit to it.
[02:15:02.918 --> 02:15:03.978]  So, there you go.
[02:15:03.978 --> 02:15:09.119]  I guess Donald Trump's responsible for this latest Islamic attack on a church.
[02:15:09.119 --> 02:15:10.680]  Again, an attack on Christians.
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:13.980]  David Horowitz of FrontPageMagazine.com, best-selling author.
[02:15:13.980 --> 02:15:17.321]  Thank you for joining us to break down the latest waves.
[02:15:17.321 --> 02:15:20.162]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:15:20.162 --> 02:15:24.562]  Yeah, I was just supposed to be at the Berkeley Free Speech Movement.
[02:15:24.562 --> 02:15:29.283]  I was actually supposed to speak tomorrow night, but the university shut it down.
[02:15:29.283 --> 02:15:31.984]  I put up posters.
[02:15:33.435 --> 02:15:45.222]  Which I identified professors and activists at UC Berkeley as agents of Hamas, terrorists, supporters of terrorism.
[02:15:45.222 --> 02:16:00.932]  And what it said, the poster said, supporters of terrorism, and it had Hatem Batsian, who is a Hamas agent, easily verifiable on the web, and Judith Butler, who said that Hamas and Hezbollah are part of the progressive movement.
[02:16:02.315 --> 02:16:04.158]  Uh, and what did the university do?
[02:16:04.158 --> 02:16:09.185]  The chancellor announced that they were investigating to see whether those posters were a hate crime.
[02:16:09.185 --> 02:16:13.793]  It's not any far!
[02:16:15.308 --> 02:16:23.470]  Any of our people are terrible, but the real enemy is, what's her name, Napolitano, Janet, the President of the University of California.
[02:16:23.470 --> 02:16:25.851]  Former head of Homeland Security.
[02:16:25.851 --> 02:16:25.951]  Yeah.
[02:16:25.951 --> 02:16:30.652]  The same one that tried to cover up Islamic terror, blocked Islamic terror investigations, and expanding on that.
[02:16:30.652 --> 02:16:36.893]  I noticed the San Jose Mercury News lied and said, oh, the student group cancelled it in a stunt.
[02:16:37.173 --> 02:16:38.515]  No, it's official.
[02:16:38.515 --> 02:16:40.899]  They were told it was cancelled by the school.
[02:16:40.899 --> 02:16:45.647]  So the left won't even admit they're cancelling free speech on colleges.
[02:16:45.647 --> 02:16:47.550]  They even lie about that when they do it.
[02:16:48.140 --> 02:17:00.430]  Yeah, if the university wanted a conservative speaker to teach their students the importance of having a diversity of viewpoint, it would be very easy.
[02:17:00.430 --> 02:17:03.853]  The chancellor could invite Milo.
[02:17:03.853 --> 02:17:10.038]  The vice chancellor in charge of diversity and inclusion could invite Milo to speak.
[02:17:10.658 --> 02:17:26.205]  What the vice chancellor in charge of diversity inclusion did was he invited the Southern Poverty Law Center to come in this week to advise the radicals there on how to oppose Milo.
[02:17:27.499 --> 02:17:28.961]  That's where the universities are.
[02:17:28.961 --> 02:17:29.702]  They're gone.
[02:17:29.702 --> 02:17:34.967]  Our universities, the left has totally dominated them.
[02:17:34.967 --> 02:17:38.290]  Of course, I'm not talking about the physics departments and so forth.
[02:17:38.290 --> 02:17:43.936]  Sure, but when it comes to the political system and the police, the police are ordered to stand down so Antifa can come beat you up.
[02:17:43.936 --> 02:17:48.360]  Then they say, oh sorry, all free speech is banned by anybody who's not a communist or an Islamist.
[02:17:49.521 --> 02:17:51.202]  They did better.
[02:17:51.202 --> 02:17:58.105]  When Milo showed up yesterday, the police kept all the supporters out.
[02:17:58.105 --> 02:17:59.486]  They let in a dozen people.
[02:17:59.486 --> 02:18:03.868]  There were hundreds there.
[02:18:03.868 --> 02:18:05.009]  It's mind-boggling.
[02:18:05.009 --> 02:18:07.830]  What they're saying is, we're going to let you get beat up.
[02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:09.271]  We're not going to let your supporters defend you.
[02:18:11.926 --> 02:18:24.512]  So David Horowitz, how far can this go as free speech is banned on campuses, as the communists basically have had a malice victory taking over, because as you know this is a malice model in their own words, to first seize the universities.
[02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:30.971]  Well, it's been a 30 or 40 year effort where they've been just unopposed.
[02:18:30.971 --> 02:18:33.152]  Republicans are out to lunch.
[02:18:33.152 --> 02:18:34.412]  They do nothing.
[02:18:34.412 --> 02:18:41.374]  The trustees are too busy raising money for these universities and, you know, building their empires to do anything.
[02:18:41.374 --> 02:18:47.635]  I've just published a book this week called The Left in the University.
[02:18:48.590 --> 02:18:51.792]  Which is my writings over the last 30 years.
[02:18:51.792 --> 02:18:59.657]  I've visited over 400 campuses and it has reports of, you know, my reports of what happened there.
[02:18:59.657 --> 02:19:03.600]  I didn't know you had another book out, because I've read 5 or 6 of your books now.
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:05.181]  I've only read a few, you know, 15 years ago.
[02:19:05.181 --> 02:19:09.504]  Well, I've got a series, Alex, it's called The Black Book of the American Left.
[02:19:10.502 --> 02:19:12.784]  This is the eighth volume.
[02:19:12.784 --> 02:19:15.765]  It'll be when it's finished.
[02:19:15.765 --> 02:19:20.348]  The last volume is already done, but I've got to wait until the spring to publish it.
[02:19:20.348 --> 02:19:28.453]  Nine volumes, which document how the left took over this country while the right was looking in the other way.
[02:19:28.453 --> 02:19:32.776]  Now, fortunately, thanks to Obama, you know,
[02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:42.609]  Unfortunately, it took having a communist in the White House to teach people how dangerous the left is.
[02:19:42.609 --> 02:19:43.530]  Exactly, so stay there.
[02:19:43.530 --> 02:19:48.114]  We'll come right back when I ask you how we defeat this and can the colleges be saved, or what do we do?
[02:19:48.114 --> 02:19:50.377]  David Horowitz, Straight Ahead, frontpagemag.com.
[02:19:51.624 --> 02:19:53.586]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:19:53.586 --> 02:19:58.910]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:19:58.910 --> 02:20:00.492]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:20:00.492 --> 02:20:08.839]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:21:54.623 --> 02:21:56.224]  Those times may be near.
[02:21:56.224 --> 02:21:57.124]  Think about it.
[02:21:57.124 --> 02:22:01.727]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[02:22:01.727 --> 02:22:06.370]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:12.537]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[02:22:12.537 --> 02:22:19.245]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[02:22:19.245 --> 02:22:21.788]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[02:22:22.228 --> 02:22:25.029]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[02:22:50.083 --> 02:22:57.886]  Dr. Carolyn Dean wants you to have a free chapter of her new book, The Magnesium Miracle 2nd Edition, and it's available at MagMiracle.com.

[02:23:19.574 --> 02:23:20.454]  It's a no-brainer.
[02:23:20.454 --> 02:23:22.835]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[02:23:22.835 --> 02:23:30.876]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[02:23:30.876 --> 02:23:32.796]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[02:23:56.723 --> 02:24:13.872]  Everybody knows, at least who's got a brain cell, that the elites actually are allied with orthodox radical Islam, and they've got a cold-blooded demographic plan to, as is in the WikiLeaks, overthrow Israel, overthrow Western Europe, overthrow the United States.
[02:24:13.872 --> 02:24:20.996]  It's a weird anti-white cosmology, I guess because they know the West isn't racist, so they try to use our
[02:24:22.405 --> 02:24:30.412]  I mean, like I said, I read David Horowitz's, several of his books, more than 15 years ago, and I thought he was crazy.
[02:24:30.412 --> 02:24:31.994]  And he writes about me thinking I was crazy.
[02:24:31.994 --> 02:24:33.555]  I guess he was right, partially.
[02:24:33.555 --> 02:24:39.340]  I just couldn't believe, knowing what I knew about Islam, and orthodox forms of it, that we would actually ally with it.
[02:24:39.340 --> 02:24:44.484]  Now it's all been proven correct in his public, and as Trump said, Obama and Hillary back to ISIS.
[02:24:45.734 --> 02:24:47.296]  And now you've got all this arrogant stuff.
[02:24:47.296 --> 02:24:47.916]  We're conned.
[02:24:47.916 --> 02:24:52.962]  This Islamist is calling Trump, you know, the ISIS backer.
[02:24:52.962 --> 02:24:54.664]  I mean, it's an upside-down world.
[02:24:54.664 --> 02:25:01.091]  And Islamic attacks now barely even make the news when somebody goes into another migrant, another invader goes in and shoots up a church.
[02:25:01.091 --> 02:25:06.737]  And now David Horowitz and Milo banned, you know, from the university.
[02:25:06.737 --> 02:25:07.417]  They canceled it.
[02:25:08.438 --> 02:25:11.460]  Well, because there hasn't been an opposition to national suicide for so long.
[02:25:11.460 --> 02:25:11.740]  Not until
[02:25:35.663 --> 02:25:37.004]  Really, the Trump campaign.
[02:25:37.004 --> 02:25:41.926]  I mean, a lot of us were working in the trenches, but we didn't have the platform.
[02:25:41.926 --> 02:25:49.630]  Trump is actually organizing a popular movement to defend America.
[02:25:49.630 --> 02:25:51.491]  But this is a first.
[02:25:51.491 --> 02:25:53.853]  It's an absolute first.
[02:25:53.853 --> 02:25:56.394]  We're just at the beginning of this war.
[02:25:56.394 --> 02:25:59.956]  Let me say, anti-white racism is the essence
[02:26:00.822 --> 02:26:01.443]  We're good to go.
[02:26:25.336 --> 02:26:26.136]  We're good to go.
[02:26:46.523 --> 02:26:49.925]  Democrats to a societal transformation i.e.
[02:26:49.925 --> 02:26:57.269]  a revolution that will end institutional racism in America.
[02:26:57.269 --> 02:26:59.731]  There is no institutional racism in America.
[02:26:59.731 --> 02:27:03.093]  We outlawed it 60 years ago with the Civil Rights Act.
[02:27:04.246 --> 02:27:15.650]  Uh, you know, and Obama's appointed, what, a thousand judges for anybody who thinks—there are no suits in court on institutional racism because it's a myth.
[02:27:15.650 --> 02:27:19.991]  But this is the battering ram that the left uses, is using against our country.
[02:27:20.011 --> 02:27:21.752]  And David this just hit me!
[02:27:35.436 --> 02:27:45.364]  America is one of the most class, and I mean this in a good way, classless systems out there, pun, we have no class, like Rodney Dangerfield's joke from, you know, a back to school movie or whatever it's called.
[02:27:45.364 --> 02:27:56.532]  But sitting here, we're one of the most unstratified systems, but our real elite is the liberal elite, Hollywood, the globalists, and they're the ones using culture war to bring us down.
[02:27:56.532 --> 02:28:02.757]  So why do we have so many rich people buying into socialism and class warfare when they know it destroys countries?
[02:28:03.311 --> 02:28:06.472]  It's mainly rich people who don't feel that they earned their money.
[02:28:06.472 --> 02:28:10.054]  That's the way I look at it.
[02:28:10.054 --> 02:28:11.054]  They don't understand.
[02:28:11.054 --> 02:28:11.755]  I mean, that's it.
[02:28:11.755 --> 02:28:14.816]  Why is there so much leftist, white guilt, Jewish guilt?
[02:28:14.816 --> 02:28:16.337]  I mean, it's just insane.
[02:28:16.337 --> 02:28:16.897]  Well, it is.
[02:28:16.897 --> 02:28:22.019]  I mean, Shelby Steele wrote a book called White Guilt, which does explain a lot of this.
[02:28:22.019 --> 02:28:26.861]  But what we have now is a generation, and that's why Trump, that's why they hate him so much.
[02:28:26.861 --> 02:28:28.282]  Make America great again.
[02:28:28.282 --> 02:28:30.063]  America first.
[02:28:30.063 --> 02:28:30.843]  No more guilt.
[02:28:33.753 --> 02:28:36.100]  That's their biggest, you know, advantage.
[02:28:37.546 --> 02:28:44.691]  That the opposition, or the people who should be in the opposition, feel guilty and they can't defend themselves.
[02:28:44.691 --> 02:28:45.912]  You see that in Europe.
[02:28:45.912 --> 02:28:47.492]  I mean, it's terrible.
[02:28:47.492 --> 02:28:54.837]  I mean, this is a thousand-year-old culture.
[02:28:54.837 --> 02:28:57.459]  It's such a remarkable contribution to human kind.
[02:28:57.459 --> 02:28:59.700]  And it's committing suicide!
[02:28:59.700 --> 02:29:01.261]  And they won't defend it!
[02:29:01.261 --> 02:29:04.963]  And it's not like it's committing suicide to some superior culture that came along.
[02:29:04.963 --> 02:29:06.144]  It's committing suicide to...
[02:29:06.604 --> 02:29:08.266]  I don't know.
[02:29:17.580 --> 02:29:20.581]  David, we got you on ten minutes late because of Skype problems.
[02:29:20.581 --> 02:29:21.561]  I've got a few more questions.
[02:29:21.561 --> 02:29:23.562]  Can you do five more minutes or do you have to go?
[02:29:23.562 --> 02:29:24.302]  Sure.
[02:29:24.302 --> 02:29:24.862]  We're going to take a break.
[02:29:24.862 --> 02:29:25.943]  We'll do five more minutes.
[02:29:25.943 --> 02:29:36.666]  I've got Roger Stone joining us on the eve of his Russia collusion testimony and other fairy tales that these Democrat fairy tale writers are telling us about.
[02:29:36.666 --> 02:29:37.246]  We'll be back.
[02:29:37.246 --> 02:29:38.006]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:38.006 --> 02:29:40.507]  Infowars.com.
[02:29:40.507 --> 02:29:41.907]  We're on the march.
[02:29:41.907 --> 02:29:44.428]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:44.428 --> 02:29:47.129]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:51.753 --> 02:29:58.350]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[02:29:58.350 --> 02:30:00.034]  You're a white man!

[02:30:34.491 --> 02:30:38.078]  The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[02:30:38.078 --> 02:30:41.003]  The silent majority is no longer silent.
[02:30:41.003 --> 02:30:42.266]  This is The War Room.
[02:30:51.969 --> 02:31:00.711]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[02:31:00.711 --> 02:31:01.251]  That's right.
[02:31:01.251 --> 02:31:06.512]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Right's freeze dryers.

[02:31:20.775 --> 02:31:21.015]  Woo!
[02:31:21.015 --> 02:31:22.056]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:31:22.056 --> 02:31:30.797]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:31:30.797 --> 02:31:38.959]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:31:40.379 --> 02:31:43.821]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[02:31:43.821 --> 02:31:47.944]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[02:31:47.944 --> 02:31:49.004]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:33:19.085 --> 02:33:31.633]  You know, people call me the conspiracy theorist, and what media does over the years is they take things I've said, and you notice it's never a video clip, or if it is, it's all cut together, to say stuff that just sounds insane.
[02:33:32.677 --> 02:33:36.200]  Or they'll take when I've done comedy skits and say that I'm being serious.
[02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:37.941]  That's why I pretty much quit doing comedy.
[02:33:37.941 --> 02:33:39.682]  You know, I like to have some fun.
[02:33:39.682 --> 02:33:42.485]  And I don't just want to kiss David Horowitz's butt, okay?
[02:33:42.485 --> 02:33:49.350]  But he's a big guy, and after I attacked him and said horrible things about him over the years, when I actually woke up, he was a nice guy and came on the show.
[02:33:50.441 --> 02:33:51.622]  But let me explain.
[02:33:51.622 --> 02:33:53.703]  Like he tells you, he used to be a leftist too.
[02:33:53.703 --> 02:33:55.263]  That's why he understands the process.
[02:33:55.263 --> 02:33:57.184]  And I was never a leftist.
[02:33:57.184 --> 02:34:00.986]  But I would still buy their propaganda because I was a good guy.
[02:34:00.986 --> 02:34:02.967]  And I was going to fight the racist.
[02:34:02.967 --> 02:34:09.571]  And I was going to fight, you know, if Israel was too right-wing and did some things bad, I was going to, you know, take both sides.
[02:34:09.571 --> 02:34:11.512]  Until I looked into it a lot deeper.
[02:34:11.512 --> 02:34:16.654]  And I realized that these globalists and these PR firms and George Soros were chomping me.
[02:34:16.654 --> 02:34:19.676]  And it came out in the WikiLeaks, of course, how they were manipulating everybody.
[02:34:20.276 --> 02:34:32.628]  But I read, oh that book, I forget the name of it, it was something like Alliance of Evil or Unholy Alliance, and then I read three or four more of his books years after I finally woke up that it was true.
[02:34:32.628 --> 02:34:39.595]  But I have an excuse, and I'm only telling this story not to, you know, sit there and placate or anything or sit there and talk about how I'm wrong.
[02:34:39.595 --> 02:34:40.235]  I'm rarely wrong.
[02:34:40.976 --> 02:34:52.882]  I couldn't dream that Western elites that already got full control of the country and Europe and all this wealth would try to desecrate it and try to blow it up and try to bring it down.
[02:34:52.882 --> 02:34:54.303]  It's mentally ill.
[02:34:54.303 --> 02:34:55.183]  It's stupid.
[02:34:55.183 --> 02:34:56.224]  It's counterintuitive.
[02:34:56.224 --> 02:34:57.324]  There's no logic.
[02:34:57.324 --> 02:35:03.427]  But now everything Horowitz wrote 15, 16, 17 years ago has turned out to be true.
[02:35:03.427 --> 02:35:05.488]  If anything, it's worse than he's saying.
[02:35:05.488 --> 02:35:06.989]  So I still don't get
[02:35:08.675 --> 02:35:26.549]  The murderous hatred of West and success and why would George Soros, a weirdo Nazi collaborator, say on 60 Minutes he's not sad for what he did when he's Jewish and then in the WikiLeaks want to overthrow Israel and turn it over to the Palestinians who would kill each other in five minutes!
[02:35:26.549 --> 02:35:29.752]  You know, Saudi Arabia won't take one refugee.
[02:35:29.752 --> 02:35:30.232]  You know why?
[02:35:31.013 --> 02:35:33.916]  Because they're a bunch of nomads that run around killing everybody.
[02:35:33.916 --> 02:35:35.197]  What do you think the Syria thing was?
[02:35:35.197 --> 02:35:39.721]  It was a big invasion of these vagabond groups that go around feeding on each other.
[02:35:39.721 --> 02:35:41.542]  And I feel sorry for the Muslims.
[02:35:41.542 --> 02:35:49.750]  I can't stand how they run around killing each other and are like psychotic and inbred and have hundreds of times more birth defects than anybody else.
[02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:51.191]  They're scary.
[02:35:51.191 --> 02:35:53.553]  And I didn't want to just go have these wars either.
[02:35:53.553 --> 02:35:57.396]  And I know a lot of them were misdirected because we go take out Saddam and put stuff in worse.
[02:35:58.217 --> 02:35:59.938]  Just like the Arab Spring!
[02:35:59.938 --> 02:36:02.340]  So, Sir David Horowitz, let me just ask you this.
[02:36:02.340 --> 02:36:08.265]  You say the war's just starting, we're just waking up, we're just starting to have victories, it's gonna be a hard row.
[02:36:08.265 --> 02:36:11.948]  They're going for everything to bully everybody right now into submission.
[02:36:11.948 --> 02:36:12.928]  I don't see it working.
[02:36:13.843 --> 02:36:16.344]  I think if they kill Trump, we're going to have a civil war.
[02:36:16.344 --> 02:36:19.985]  I mean, this is just too real now.
[02:36:19.985 --> 02:36:26.547]  And so you were a leftist, you woke up, maybe you could spend a minute or two on that process, and then looking at your crystal ball, what's coming next?
[02:36:26.547 --> 02:36:36.751]  Because if I was a Muslim, and I was coming from some hellhole, oppressed, controlled, in a cult, and I got here to have freedom, I would love that!
[02:36:36.751 --> 02:36:41.233]  Why would you come from a hellhole, and then come somewhere, and then want to blow it up?
[02:36:41.233 --> 02:36:41.973]  I just don't get it.
[02:36:43.069 --> 02:36:44.535]  Well, people are screwed up.
[02:36:44.535 --> 02:36:48.530]  I mean, that's a basic fact of life.
[02:36:49.789 --> 02:36:52.071]  So you're always going to find people like that.
[02:36:52.071 --> 02:36:59.637]  What I think is happening is that the one thing you can count on the left on is never to know when to stop.
[02:36:59.637 --> 02:37:01.839]  They've destroyed a lot of the power.
[02:37:01.839 --> 02:37:05.662]  I mean, racism, to be called a racist used to be a really terrible thing.
[02:37:05.662 --> 02:37:11.346]  But now that they call everybody a racist, it doesn't have the bite it had.
[02:37:11.346 --> 02:37:16.570]  And that's emboldened our side, people who love this country, to fight.
[02:37:18.891 --> 02:37:20.172]  And not shrinking.
[02:37:20.172 --> 02:37:33.960]  You know, what happened before it, when I went out like 16 years ago, they had this reparations for slavery paid 137 years after the fact to multi-millionaires like Jesse Jackson.
[02:37:35.201 --> 02:37:36.482]  And I oppose it.
[02:37:36.482 --> 02:37:37.763]  I didn't have any support.
[02:37:37.763 --> 02:37:43.227]  I did have support from Tom Sowell and Walter Williams in opposing it.
[02:37:43.227 --> 02:37:47.971]  But the rest of the conservative world said, whoa, let's see if David survives this.
[02:37:47.971 --> 02:37:50.693]  I was called a racist from one end of the country to another.
[02:37:50.693 --> 02:37:52.654]  That's all changing now.
[02:37:52.654 --> 02:37:55.296]  We have a younger generation.
[02:37:55.296 --> 02:37:56.778]  You know, I watch a lot of
[02:37:58.078 --> 02:38:01.679]  Paul Joseph Watson's terrific videos.
[02:38:01.679 --> 02:38:14.084]  But people of that generation are emboldened, they're tough, they're smart, they've learned from the left how to fight politically.
[02:38:14.084 --> 02:38:18.025]  You know, you can think of a lot of them, Crowder and all these other people.
[02:38:18.025 --> 02:38:26.368]  A lot of young blacks you see on the social media now attacking these mythologies.
[02:38:28.089 --> 02:38:31.953]  I just think that the left has reached
[02:38:35.501 --> 02:38:41.225]  And that's why his base cannot desert him when he doesn't get everything done perfectly.
[02:38:41.225 --> 02:38:42.546]  What he's already done, he's a hero.
[02:39:05.271 --> 02:39:12.286]  I mean, that's one thing, you know, the so-called liberal media, they have contempt
[02:39:13.817 --> 02:39:18.139]  But ordinary people actually can think.
[02:39:18.139 --> 02:39:43.452]  You know, I remember when McCain, just before he got the nomination, in 2008, I was with a moral majority group in Georgia, Ralph Reed's group, and I talked to them and I said, well, if McCain gets the nomination,
[02:39:44.172 --> 02:39:55.480]  I mean, they're not crazy, as you know, religious kooks.
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:57.441]  They're people who can think.
[02:39:57.441 --> 02:40:02.744]  And I think thinking America is coming to the fore now.
[02:40:02.744 --> 02:40:03.445]  We'll see.
[02:40:03.445 --> 02:40:09.569]  I mean, this fight over the national anthem is really kind of significant.
[02:40:10.174 --> 02:40:13.036]  I mean, I think they jumped the shark on this one, David Horowitz, in closing.
[02:40:13.036 --> 02:40:14.097]  We're going to Roger Stone.
[02:40:14.097 --> 02:40:15.878]  I appreciate your extra time.
[02:40:15.878 --> 02:40:22.962]  Because, I mean, this is the flag, and this is America, and we're not perfect, but you don't go anywhere else and attack the flag.
[02:40:22.962 --> 02:40:30.327]  I mean, the players in an exhibition game, they kneeled for the flag, but stood up for God Save the Queen.
[02:40:30.327 --> 02:40:34.590]  I mean, it just shows that they know you're allowed to walk on America
[02:40:35.370 --> 02:40:49.919]  And use our openness to do that and people are sick of it and the NFL is losing tons of ratings, tons of money, but still the players and the union and the owners are lockstep against Trump because they still think mainstream media is everything.
[02:40:49.919 --> 02:40:51.660]  They have this giant blind spot.
[02:40:51.660 --> 02:40:52.961]  Where do you see this going?
[02:40:52.961 --> 02:40:55.502]  I mean, I see this as a sea change moment.
[02:40:55.502 --> 02:40:56.443]  What happened with the NFL?
[02:40:57.498 --> 02:41:07.505]  Well, you know, I wish that he hadn't called them sons of bitches, because a lot of them, what he did was he unified.
[02:41:07.505 --> 02:41:10.907]  I mean, instead of having eight of them doing it, there's now 200.
[02:41:10.907 --> 02:41:11.387]  However...
[02:41:13.251 --> 02:41:19.416]  Trump is very, very smart when it comes to political tactics, and this is a crucial issue.
[02:41:19.416 --> 02:41:21.237]  America hasn't had defenders.
[02:41:21.237 --> 02:41:23.739]  The flag hasn't had defenders.
[02:41:23.739 --> 02:41:29.022]  Who would do this except Trump?
[02:41:29.022 --> 02:41:32.045]  And I think that people will rally behind him.
[02:41:32.045 --> 02:41:35.827]  You know, I think a lot of these owners, look, they're between a rock and a hard place.
[02:41:35.827 --> 02:41:42.092]  They've got all these ballplayers, all these multi, multi, multi-millionaires.
[02:41:43.303 --> 02:41:45.944]  That they have to keep somehow happy.
[02:41:45.944 --> 02:41:46.964]  They're losing money.
[02:41:46.964 --> 02:41:49.584]  They've got a media.
[02:41:49.584 --> 02:41:53.905]  I mean, ESPN, the whole sports world is left.
[02:41:53.905 --> 02:41:57.226]  And I think the race thing is very, very significant.
[02:41:57.226 --> 02:42:05.427]  You know, most of those players giving the knee are black.
[02:42:05.427 --> 02:42:12.649]  And the owners, I think, I'm sure that Robert Kraft is not going to vote.
[02:42:13.629 --> 02:42:15.811]  For a Trump opponent in the next election.
[02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:19.811]  Sure, he's just having to verge his signal because he's been bullied.
[02:42:19.811 --> 02:42:21.392]  And just the image of love it or leave it.
[02:42:21.392 --> 02:42:24.975]  You can't go anywhere else and make this type of money playing a game.
[02:42:24.975 --> 02:42:27.817]  It's the thanklessness.
[02:42:27.817 --> 02:42:28.397]  I'm so tired.
[02:42:28.397 --> 02:42:35.702]  And then you've got a bunch of white fans there in the stadium being made to feel like they're not welcome, when we're one of the most unified countries in the world.
[02:42:35.702 --> 02:42:39.344]  And statistics show that actually a lot of this is backfiring, and I agree.
[02:42:39.344 --> 02:42:41.205]  The left doesn't know when to stop.
[02:42:41.205 --> 02:42:43.127]  Don't interrupt an enemy while they're destroying themselves.
[02:42:43.947 --> 02:42:45.348]  And Trump is one in a billion.
[02:42:45.348 --> 02:42:46.889]  David Horowitz, thank you so much for the time.
[02:42:46.889 --> 02:42:48.490]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:42:48.490 --> 02:42:50.751]  And his new book, find it at FrontPageMagazine.com.
[02:42:50.751 --> 02:42:59.956]  Now, joining us via Skype on the eve of his testimony tomorrow on the whole Russiagate garbage is Roger Stone.
[02:42:59.956 --> 02:43:04.279]  Why this is so important is they've done this to a lot of different people that have gone public.
[02:43:04.279 --> 02:43:09.382]  You go in, it's secret, then they put out fake news.
[02:43:10.390 --> 02:43:13.152]  They may say Roger Stone says he's a Russian agent.
[02:43:13.152 --> 02:43:15.354]  Roger will run out?
[02:43:15.354 --> 02:43:18.276]  Because they'll do it right when he goes in.
[02:43:18.276 --> 02:43:20.618]  They've done this to Caputo and a bunch of other folks.
[02:43:20.618 --> 02:43:36.030]  So that's why Roger is going to put out a statement to Infowars.com exclusively right before he goes in and we're going to have our own reporter there to actually get a live feed and record what he really says so we can have it out versus the media editing it up.
[02:43:36.030 --> 02:43:36.830]  We did that to
[02:43:37.751 --> 02:43:39.593]  Alex, thank you so much for letting me jump in here today.
[02:43:58.078 --> 02:44:00.861]  Hunkered down with my lawyers.
[02:44:00.861 --> 02:44:01.922]  I've changed lawyers.
[02:44:01.922 --> 02:44:07.849]  I was with the firm of Ketchum & Fleasom, but I've moved to the firm of Dewey, Cheatham & Howe.
[02:44:07.849 --> 02:44:09.231]  Only kidding.
[02:44:09.231 --> 02:44:13.816]  I've got really fine lawyers, and we're really prepared.
[02:44:13.816 --> 02:44:17.260]  Now, the mainstream media assault on me has already begun.
[02:44:18.226 --> 02:44:32.033]  A particularly dishonest piece on CNN by some scumbag named Michael Weiss, full of inaccuracies, partial quotes, selective quotes, things taken out of context.
[02:44:32.033 --> 02:44:33.354]  What do you expect from CNN?
[02:44:34.253 --> 02:44:40.157]  Also, particularly vicious piece by the left-wing fake news site, Raw Story.
[02:44:40.157 --> 02:44:56.867]  So, they are circling the wagons because they know that I will be on offense, that I will expose Congressman Adam Schiff as the demagogic charlatan that he is, and there will be no holds barred.
[02:44:56.867 --> 02:45:01.290]  Now, in order to guard against exactly what you describe,
[02:45:02.173 --> 02:45:17.508]  And precisely what happened to my colleague, Michael Caputo, because they won't allow public access to the hearing, because they will not allow the media in the room, because they will not release the transcript
[02:45:18.128 --> 02:45:27.295]  I'm going to record my statement exclusively for InfoWars.com, and we will put it up at about the time that the hearings kick off.
[02:45:27.295 --> 02:45:45.588]  So you'll be able to see what really is going to transpire, and then immediately afterwards I will interview with our embedded cameraman from InfoWars to be able to give a blow-by-blow description of what I'm calling the romp in the swamp.
[02:45:46.252 --> 02:45:54.100]  The California kid, the provaricator, the proven liar, Adam Schiff versus Roger Stone.
[02:45:54.980 --> 02:46:02.502]  Well, I know you're relishing this and you really wanted to do it live, but after Sessions mopped the floor with them and the rest of it, they're scared to have any of these hearings.
[02:46:02.502 --> 02:46:05.703]  But as you said, with Caputo, they then put out stuff he never said.
[02:46:05.703 --> 02:46:07.224]  When the transcript letter came out, it was true.
[02:46:07.224 --> 02:46:08.664]  He never said those things.
[02:46:08.664 --> 02:46:10.985]  They are a pack of disingenuous scum.
[02:46:10.985 --> 02:46:13.226]  I mean, we already know that.
[02:46:13.226 --> 02:46:15.406]  We already know there is no evidence to give them.
[02:46:15.406 --> 02:46:18.627]  Now they've not fully moved on from Russia, but they're on fumes.
[02:46:18.627 --> 02:46:23.309]  That's why they're admitting, oh, now it didn't pay your taxes or didn't fill out a form properly.
[02:46:23.770 --> 02:46:25.906]  SWAT teaming somebody, even CNN admits that...
[02:46:27.887 --> 02:46:34.850]  That this whole fake Russia investigator situation with Mueller is, quote, very unorthodox, very aggressive.
[02:46:34.850 --> 02:46:37.971]  Many others are calling it illegal, what they're doing.
[02:46:37.971 --> 02:46:40.612]  So they've really not wanted you to testify so far.
[02:46:40.612 --> 02:46:45.373]  They kept canceling the other events when it was going to be in public because they're so scared.
[02:46:45.373 --> 02:46:47.574]  What are they scared of, Roger?
[02:46:47.574 --> 02:46:54.757]  Because, again, as they run out of gas here, and now as they move on to financial crimes, what do you expect to happen?
[02:46:55.776 --> 02:46:59.258]  Well, I think what they're afraid of, Alex, is I'm going to call their bluff.
[02:46:59.258 --> 02:47:01.799]  Let's go through the big three allegations.
[02:47:01.799 --> 02:47:07.201]  One, Stone knew about the hacking of Podesta's email in advance.
[02:47:07.201 --> 02:47:07.741]  No, I didn't.
[02:47:07.741 --> 02:47:12.924]  I never said anything of the kind, even anything remotely close to that.
[02:47:12.924 --> 02:47:22.348]  Now, the Panama Papers, published in January of last year, completely expose Podesta's shady business dealings with the Russians.
[02:47:23.132 --> 02:47:24.253]  Guess what?
[02:47:24.253 --> 02:47:26.214]  Roger Stone can read!
[02:47:26.214 --> 02:47:31.597]  That's how I knew, and that's what I meant when I referred to Podesta's time in the barrel.
[02:47:31.597 --> 02:47:39.562]  Specifically, that his shady business dealings with the oligarchs around Vladimir Putin would come under public scrutiny.
[02:47:39.562 --> 02:47:45.486]  Second charge, Stone knew in advance about the WikiLeaks disclosures of Hillary.
[02:47:45.486 --> 02:47:48.488]  Yeah, they were posted in their Twitter feed on July 21st.
[02:47:50.501 --> 02:47:52.843]  This was August that I predicted it.
[02:47:52.843 --> 02:48:00.088]  Now, did I have a source confirm for me directly with Wikileaks that this was coming before I said it?
[02:48:00.088 --> 02:48:00.989]  Yes, I did.
[02:48:00.989 --> 02:48:03.631]  That makes me smart, not dumb.
[02:48:03.631 --> 02:48:09.556]  And then lastly, there is the phony charge that I colluded with Goose for 2.0.
[02:48:09.556 --> 02:48:20.164]  But if one looks at the actual exchange, which happened six weeks after the Wikileaks posted the material from the DNC, you'll see that it's benign.
[02:48:21.139 --> 02:48:27.462]  Uh, so based on timing, content, and context, this is a MacGuffin.
[02:48:27.462 --> 02:48:29.323]  This is, uh, meaningless.
[02:48:29.323 --> 02:48:32.705]  By the way, does Guccifer 2.0 really exist?
[02:48:32.705 --> 02:48:35.307]  Is that really a person?
[02:48:35.307 --> 02:48:37.348]  Uh, was he really a hack?
[02:48:37.348 --> 02:48:40.569]  In fact, was there ever really a hack of the United States?
[02:48:40.569 --> 02:48:43.451]  But Roger, the whole thing's been a nothing burger.
[02:48:43.451 --> 02:48:46.512]  And I remember you at the time, we were trying to get a hold of Assange.
[02:48:46.512 --> 02:48:48.694]  Assange did New York Times, London Guardian.
[02:48:49.798 --> 02:49:04.332]  Fox News interviews talking to Assange doesn't mean you're a Russian agent saying, hey, Podesta's known for his Russia ties and then quoting New York Times articles from a year before with Hillary's Russia problem.
[02:49:04.332 --> 02:49:08.816]  I mean, you were just talking about what was there, hyping it up for people to investigate it.
[02:49:09.878 --> 02:49:20.080]  Sure, but I think because of my reputation as a fierce partisan and as an opinion journalist, particularly here at InfoWars, they think it's an easy sell.
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:24.701]  In other words, if something shady happens, Stone must have been involved.
[02:49:24.701 --> 02:49:30.863]  We're going to straighten that all out tomorrow morning, and I will have these running dogs in retreat, I assure you.
[02:49:31.854 --> 02:49:35.836]  Well, their Russian narrative is already starting to implode, so this is, I guess, the cherry on top.
[02:49:35.836 --> 02:49:44.362]  But what about the fact that they've already told your former business associate, Manafort, that they've got the indictment?
[02:49:44.362 --> 02:49:47.944]  Yeah, this is a classic prosecutor's trick.
[02:49:47.944 --> 02:49:53.667]  In other words, try to find something, or maybe find nothing, turn it into something.
[02:49:53.667 --> 02:49:59.851]  All right, Manafort, we're going to indict you for money laundering, or tax evasion, or whatever.
[02:50:00.663 --> 02:50:07.067]  Unless, of course, you just confessed that you were colluding with the Russians and that Donald Trump knew everything.
[02:50:07.067 --> 02:50:13.872]  So, in other words, bear false witness against our president, lie to let get yourself off the hook.
[02:50:13.872 --> 02:50:15.493]  Judas Iscariot!
[02:50:15.493 --> 02:50:24.599]  Yeah, John Dean, essentially, because John Dean is the man who planned, pushed, covered up the Watergate break-in, and then blamed it on Richard Nixon.
[02:50:24.599 --> 02:50:25.320]  It's the same deal.
[02:50:26.670 --> 02:50:27.351]  Absolutely.
[02:50:27.351 --> 02:50:29.772]  Roger Stone is our guest testifying in Congress tomorrow.
[02:50:29.772 --> 02:50:32.074]  They won't even bring in a cell phone.
[02:50:32.074 --> 02:50:34.175]  He can't even record it.
[02:50:34.175 --> 02:50:38.759]  But you know those dirty rats are going to come out and lie to the media.
[02:50:38.759 --> 02:50:42.021]  Hell, CNN, the rest of them, may not even have Roger on.
[02:50:42.021 --> 02:50:43.562]  That's how they operate now.
[02:50:43.562 --> 02:50:49.707]  They just make up straw men, then they beat up the straw men and declare that they beat Floyd Mayweather.
[02:50:49.707 --> 02:50:50.127]  We'll be back.
[02:50:51.243 --> 02:50:53.826]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[02:50:53.826 --> 02:50:55.969]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[02:50:55.969 --> 02:50:57.951]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[02:50:57.951 --> 02:51:00.014]  Find your happiness with Pure Soap.

[02:51:11.365 --> 02:51:14.646]  You're getting soap products twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:51:14.646 --> 02:51:16.906]  Earth friendly and natural soaps.

[02:52:50.543 --> 02:52:52.504]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:52:52.504 --> 02:52:57.825]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:52:57.825 --> 02:52:59.405]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:52:59.405 --> 02:53:07.747]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:53:07.747 --> 02:53:13.449]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:53:13.629 --> 02:53:15.450]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:53:15.450 --> 02:53:17.712]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:53:17.712 --> 02:53:22.115]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:53:22.115 --> 02:53:24.296]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:53:24.296 --> 02:53:32.122]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:53:32.782 --> 02:53:33.923]  Alright, final segment.
[02:53:33.923 --> 02:53:34.143]  And then...
[02:54:03.553 --> 02:54:06.035]  Matt Dubiel, really smart guy.
[02:54:06.035 --> 02:54:07.596]  Manager of our Chicago affiliate.
[02:54:07.596 --> 02:54:10.278]  Known him for eight, nine years now.
[02:54:10.278 --> 02:54:11.739]  Visited me a few times in Austin.
[02:54:11.739 --> 02:54:12.940]  Amazing.
[02:54:12.940 --> 02:54:13.680]  He's going to be hosting.
[02:54:13.680 --> 02:54:15.342]  He's got some big stuff planned for Chicago.
[02:54:15.342 --> 02:54:17.723]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:54:17.723 --> 02:54:19.144]  It'll make the news.
[02:54:19.144 --> 02:54:20.325]  But he's coming up.
[02:54:20.325 --> 02:54:22.267]  Roger, I know you don't want to give away too much today.
[02:54:23.641 --> 02:54:27.667]  So we're just going to have you on live right after the hearing tomorrow.
[02:54:27.667 --> 02:54:31.832]  And of course your statement will go up on InfoWars.com right as you go in.
[02:54:31.832 --> 02:54:36.899]  And I guess you're going to take that statement today with us and also give us a written statement.
[02:54:38.248 --> 02:54:40.049]  Any other little tidbits you want to add?
[02:54:40.049 --> 02:54:42.449]  Tell folks again what time the hearing is.
[02:54:42.449 --> 02:54:43.810]  This is game day.
[02:54:43.810 --> 02:54:44.610]  And then expanding.
[02:54:44.610 --> 02:54:59.454]  What do you make of the left, like David Horowitz said earlier, not knowing when to stop, and going up against the American flag and America, and now they're on CNN and MSNBC saying, get rid of the flag, it's white supremacist, get rid of the Star Spangled Banner.
[02:54:59.454 --> 02:55:03.735]  I mean, we knew that was coming, but I mean, don't all the minorities get?
[02:55:03.735 --> 02:55:05.196]  I know they're not the ones really running this.
[02:55:05.196 --> 02:55:05.896]  I mean, literally.
[02:55:06.736 --> 02:55:07.877]  Like, you're America.
[02:55:07.877 --> 02:55:09.597]  It's yours.
[02:55:09.597 --> 02:55:15.680]  It's big, it's prosperous, it's still one of the best places ever to be able to do whatever you want.
[02:55:15.680 --> 02:55:19.201]  You live here, you get rich here, and then you piss all over it?
[02:55:19.201 --> 02:55:21.122]  It's the most spoiled rotten crap I've ever seen.
[02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:32.689]  They don't seem to understand all they're doing is driving more average Americans into the Trump camp and into the silent majority.
[02:55:32.689 --> 02:55:35.572]  It's offensive that they don't love their country.
[02:55:35.572 --> 02:55:39.736]  It's offensive that they don't respect our democracy, our constitution.
[02:55:39.736 --> 02:55:41.497]  This country is not perfect.
[02:55:41.497 --> 02:55:44.260]  It's only the best place on the face of the earth.
[02:55:45.044 --> 02:55:52.392]  The democratic experiment is not ideal, it's not perfect, but we have more freedom than any place else on the globe.
[02:55:52.392 --> 02:55:54.915]  So it's self-defeating.
[02:55:54.915 --> 02:56:03.605]  Alex, I do want to mention that a number of info warriors and the blacks for Trump are having a pro-Stone demonstration.
[02:56:04.325 --> 02:56:07.247]  At 8.15 tomorrow morning, the hearing is at 9.00.
[02:56:07.247 --> 02:56:22.938]  Now, the Capitol Hill Police won't let any civilians get anywhere near this hearing, so this is being held on Independence Avenue, directly across from the House wing of the Capitol, right there on Independence Avenue.
[02:56:22.938 --> 02:56:24.920]  And I'm going to stop there on my way in.
[02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:26.361]  M4s will be covering it.
[02:56:26.881 --> 02:56:32.425]  And I'll have a few words for the patriots there who are rallying to support me.
[02:56:32.425 --> 02:56:33.926]  And we're going to have a live feed of that.
[02:56:33.926 --> 02:56:36.909]  We're going to have a live feed of that with our great Michael Zimmerman, who's with you.
[02:56:36.909 --> 02:56:50.759]  Yeah, I expect it to be a dynamic moment, and I can't tell you how much I appreciate not only the support, but also the fact that InfoWars is going to be able to bring it to the people of Iraq.
[02:56:50.759 --> 02:56:51.960]  By the way, Roger, you're a smart guy.
[02:56:51.960 --> 02:56:52.901]  I don't have to tell you this.
[02:56:53.681 --> 02:56:58.385]  I'd give them both barrels, your big finale up front, what you're really going to say inside.
[02:56:58.385 --> 02:57:10.495]  Not just the statement, but you know, Roger Stone tears into fake committee, Roger Stone destroys fake committee at the Capitol video, because that video, we're not going to clickbait, it's you at the Capitol, but Roger Stone destroys committee live.
[02:57:11.075 --> 02:57:20.981]  You know, or destroys false Russian narrative, and then that video will go viral, and I would go as long as you can, because, I mean, that's a video that millions are going to end up watching live or tuning into.
[02:57:20.981 --> 02:57:23.443]  You know, Roger Stone's press conference from the Capitol.
[02:57:23.443 --> 02:57:24.844]  And then I do it before and after.
[02:57:24.844 --> 02:57:30.868]  I'd really make an extravaganza out of it, because this is how we grab the spotlight away from these liars.
[02:57:32.116 --> 02:57:34.457]  Well, Alex, don't you worry.
[02:57:34.457 --> 02:57:38.780]  As my friend Pat Buchanan would say, I will be locked and loaded.
[02:57:38.780 --> 02:57:39.360]  All right, Roger.
[02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:40.181]  We'll be covering it live.
[02:57:40.181 --> 02:57:42.802]  It'll be at newswars.com and infowars.com.
[02:57:42.802 --> 02:57:44.423]  Thank you, Roger.
[02:57:44.423 --> 02:57:46.124]  Alex, victory or death?
[02:57:46.124 --> 02:57:49.766]  I like how he quotes Colonel Travis.
[02:57:49.766 --> 02:57:51.187]  Because that's who said that.
[02:57:51.187 --> 02:57:52.288]  And you know what happened to him.
[02:57:53.868 --> 02:57:55.230]  But in the end, he ended up winning.
[02:57:55.230 --> 02:57:58.593]  Okay, it is ending today because they have to stop because they like to deliver food.
[02:57:58.593 --> 02:58:03.358]  They like to ship the food within 48 hours and get the order and it's so many orders have come in.
[02:58:03.358 --> 02:58:04.800]  It's about to slow them down.
[02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:07.303]  So the 50% off is over.
[02:58:07.303 --> 02:58:08.184]  My Patriots apply.
[02:58:08.184 --> 02:58:09.886]  That's not 50% off some higher price.
[02:58:09.886 --> 02:58:11.868]  That's 50% off the regular super low.
[02:58:12.408 --> 02:58:18.669]  It's labeled as InfoWars Select, our highest quality food, but I can contractually be able to do it by that by calling it InfoWars Select.
[02:58:18.669 --> 02:58:20.069]  It's out of the same factory.
[02:58:20.069 --> 02:58:21.630]  Absolutely fresh.
[02:58:21.630 --> 02:58:23.450]  50% off sortable food insta-day.
[02:58:23.450 --> 02:58:25.210]  Secret 12 is now the new sale.
[02:58:25.210 --> 02:58:26.751]  It's 40% off and more.
[02:58:26.751 --> 02:58:29.251]  InfoWarsLive.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:29.251 --> 02:58:31.912]  I'm gonna do five more minutes.
[02:58:31.912 --> 02:58:34.792]  Come back, interview Matt Dubiel.
[02:58:34.792 --> 02:58:35.552]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:35.552 --> 02:58:36.012]  Stay with us.

[02:59:45.012 --> 02:59:47.655]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.132 --> 03:00:02.273]  Big Brother.
[03:00:02.273 --> 03:00:04.054]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:04.054 --> 03:00:05.955]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:05.955 --> 03:00:07.656]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:07.656 --> 03:00:09.317]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:09.317 --> 03:00:13.780]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.412 --> 03:00:23.655]  Manager of WCKG 1530 in Chicago is going to be hosting the fourth hour again.
[03:00:23.655 --> 03:00:30.199]  We've launched six hours of more live shows, David Knight in the morning, right after I go off the war room with Owen Schroer.
[03:00:30.199 --> 03:00:33.880]  He's doing a week of well-deserved vacation with family back in St.
[03:00:33.880 --> 03:00:35.221]  Louis, Missouri.
[03:00:35.221 --> 03:00:46.407]  So we've got the great Rob Dew, and of course Michael Zimmerman normally co-hosts with Rob Dew when he's hosting, but he's up there to cover the hearings tomorrow, the whole
[03:00:47.848 --> 03:00:51.293]  McCarthy on PCP event.
[03:00:51.293 --> 03:00:53.496]  That's why we're trying to hire more reporters, which we're doing.
[03:00:53.496 --> 03:00:58.523]  We've got, I think we've hired like 10 people the last four or five months.
[03:00:58.523 --> 03:00:59.304]  Quality folks.
[03:00:59.304 --> 03:01:03.870]  More writers, more video editors, more videographers.
[03:01:03.870 --> 03:01:05.131]  I want to hire more talk show hosts.
[03:01:06.045 --> 03:01:18.232]  Um, and, or I want to team up with folks that have studios, like Mr. Dubiel, but he's busy running a station, and multiple stations, and we're going to go to him in the next segment, so they can host shows right here with us.
[03:01:18.232 --> 03:01:23.095]  And I want to have some roundtable shows, those are really the best too, because then really active, busy folks
[03:01:23.755 --> 03:01:30.500]  Can kind of have five or six hosts, two or three that are dominant, and then those folks don't have to host five days a week when they're busy running radio stations and everything else.
[03:01:30.500 --> 03:01:36.004]  Because in this multifaceted world, doing three hours a day is a lot, and he hosts his own show there in Chicago.
[03:01:36.004 --> 03:01:46.232]  So I do want to work with Matt, quite frankly, and I want to work with all these other people, folks like John Rappaport and others, but just getting the music ready, getting the liners ready, getting the sponsors.
[03:01:46.232 --> 03:01:47.533]  I'm not complaining.
[03:01:47.533 --> 03:01:52.416]  It's just, it's a lot to do this, and we're launching a radio slash TV network.
[03:01:53.723 --> 03:02:01.871]  And we have all these TV stations and cable stations wanting to pick the show up and then we're so busy just servicing them, they all want contracts.
[03:02:01.871 --> 03:02:12.340]  So right now it's like 30 plus radio stations and cable stations, I mean not radio stations, TV stations, several hundred radio stations, UHF, VHF and cable stations, I mean we're on
[03:02:13.301 --> 03:02:17.863]  24 hours a day on a major channel for four years now in Houston.
[03:02:17.863 --> 03:02:20.704]  We're on stations all over the country that pick up the show.
[03:02:20.704 --> 03:02:33.528]  Now I've had to go to these conferences and meet with folks to get the right satellites and a couple years ago I signed a contract that's not quite the right one they want and that was $400,000 a year so now I'm getting these other satellites and I've got these consultants and
[03:02:34.557 --> 03:02:37.459]  The point is, you build it, they come.
[03:02:37.459 --> 03:02:42.683]  And I intend to launch a 24-hour live TV system in the next year and a half.
[03:02:42.683 --> 03:02:46.466]  And I want it to be radio 20 hours a day by the end of next year.
[03:02:46.466 --> 03:02:50.870]  By the middle of next year, we'll be like 15, 16, 17 hours a day live.
[03:02:50.870 --> 03:02:53.212]  And let me tell you something, a lot of folks want to be on the air.
[03:02:54.164 --> 03:02:58.908]  But when you actually get on air, and you actually have an audience, then they're like, whoa!
[03:02:58.908 --> 03:03:02.530]  I've done shows before, but I didn't have, you know, people calling up and death-threatening me.
[03:03:02.530 --> 03:03:05.452]  And of course, you also get people buying you dinner and patting you on the back.
[03:03:05.452 --> 03:03:07.134]  It's just that this is a war, folks.
[03:03:07.134 --> 03:03:10.756]  This is being in media during a civil war.
[03:03:10.756 --> 03:03:15.900]  And I know people like Matt Dubiel, who we're both so busy, I hardly ever talk to him off-air.
[03:03:15.900 --> 03:03:16.781]  I talk to him on-air.
[03:03:17.793 --> 03:03:21.015]  You know, he's already gone through the gauntlet, putting us on the last six, seven years.
[03:03:21.015 --> 03:03:25.578]  He's already had them come and say, we're going to take your sponsors if you don't dump him, and then they do it.
[03:03:25.578 --> 03:03:30.701]  So, you know, he's already done a lot to himself and his family and the rest of it just to tell the truth.
[03:03:30.701 --> 03:03:38.066]  So that's why when you hear us on a station, you need to understand, or even if you're on the internet listening, to know there's a radio station out there.
[03:03:38.066 --> 03:03:41.288]  Go bookmark them, listen to them, thank your sponsors, send them $100.
[03:03:41.288 --> 03:03:46.992]  Give the middle class and the rich people, most of which are patriots and are on the fence, don't get up and start dumping money.
[03:03:48.319 --> 03:03:51.641]  And that means the radio stations and sponsors and the rest of it.
[03:03:51.641 --> 03:03:54.063]  We're not going to lose, but we're going to go into a really dark time.
[03:03:54.063 --> 03:03:54.883]  So let me tell you something.
[03:03:54.883 --> 03:03:56.664]  The globalists have a hunger for power.
[03:03:56.664 --> 03:03:58.466]  Like David Horowitz said earlier, they don't know when to stop.
[03:03:58.466 --> 03:03:59.786]  That's because they're stupid.
[03:03:59.786 --> 03:04:01.388]  They're greedy.
[03:04:01.388 --> 03:04:02.728]  They like to steal.
[03:04:02.728 --> 03:04:07.652]  It doesn't mean, though, if we bend over to them, it won't get really bad before we get up and kick their ass.
[03:04:07.652 --> 03:04:12.175]  Now, it looks like we're getting up right now before it gets too bad and we're about to get these vampires off our necks.
[03:04:13.055 --> 03:04:15.317]  Let's kick their ass now, okay?
[03:04:15.317 --> 03:04:16.337]  Before it gets really bad.
[03:04:16.337 --> 03:04:17.518]  Because let me tell you something.
[03:04:17.518 --> 03:04:19.500]  We've been licking them hard.
[03:04:19.500 --> 03:04:21.221]  We're putting licks on them.
[03:04:21.221 --> 03:04:22.582]  They want authoritarianism now.
[03:04:22.582 --> 03:04:25.844]  They want to go whole hog and accelerate their failed program.
[03:04:25.844 --> 03:04:27.585]  They don't think, now we're getting our ass kicked, let's stop.
[03:04:27.585 --> 03:04:29.767]  They think, oh, we haven't been bad enough.
[03:04:29.767 --> 03:04:30.728]  That's what will get us ahead.
[03:04:31.733 --> 03:04:39.801]  So, that's why we're countdown right now here, because they are launching their counter-offensive right now, and we need to finish them in the info war.
[03:04:39.801 --> 03:04:44.385]  That means spreading the word, praying for us, and spending that money with us right now.
[03:04:44.385 --> 03:04:46.247]  So get your money out and start buying!
[03:04:48.325 --> 03:04:49.806]  December 23rd, 1776.
[03:04:49.806 --> 03:04:53.788]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[03:04:53.788 --> 03:04:58.790]  The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country.
[03:04:58.790 --> 03:05:03.592]  But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.
[03:05:03.592 --> 03:05:06.214]  Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.
[03:05:06.214 --> 03:05:11.236]  Yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
[03:05:11.236 --> 03:05:14.258]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[03:05:14.258 --> 03:05:16.899]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[03:05:17.219 --> 03:05:25.926]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods, and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[03:05:25.926 --> 03:05:34.313]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[03:05:34.313 --> 03:05:39.577]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[03:05:39.577 --> 03:05:44.541]  Even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[03:05:45.422 --> 03:05:48.405]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[03:05:48.405 --> 03:05:58.993]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:05:58.993 --> 03:06:00.835]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[03:06:01.055 --> 03:06:03.917]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[03:06:03.917 --> 03:06:05.398]  It's made in the USA.
[03:06:05.398 --> 03:06:12.222]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:06:12.222 --> 03:06:14.304]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:06:14.304 --> 03:06:24.010]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:06:24.010 --> 03:06:29.013]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[03:06:29.113 --> 03:06:40.821]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:06:40.821 --> 03:06:44.123]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:06:44.123 --> 03:06:46.525]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield.
[03:06:46.525 --> 03:06:47.265]  Infowarslife.com

[03:08:00.229 --> 03:08:11.061]  Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[03:08:11.061 --> 03:08:16.187]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:38.792 --> 03:08:47.079]  Alejandro, or Alexander Villanuevo, is the only winner yesterday on the Pittsburgh Steelers.
[03:08:47.079 --> 03:08:51.824]  He's a combat veteran, Army Ranger, highly decorated, people have been looking into him.
[03:08:51.824 --> 03:08:56.668]  And he just had tears in his eyes that they were sitting there like a bunch of cowards.
[03:08:56.668 --> 03:09:01.893]  And he went out, now the coach says, oh the team made the decision, and so he may get in trouble.
[03:09:03.382 --> 03:09:07.203]  Because he just couldn't sit there and watch them pull that cowardly crap.
[03:09:07.203 --> 03:09:10.224]  I mean, it's so disrespectful to the veterans and everybody else.
[03:09:10.224 --> 03:09:12.024]  And the media's like, well, they've got free speech.
[03:09:12.024 --> 03:09:15.305]  That's right, we've got free speech to call you dart bags!
[03:09:15.305 --> 03:09:25.808]  You know, you can fine somebody for cussing on the field or spiking a football, but oh, the owners can't say, when you're doing a sport for the fans, don't piss all over the flag.
[03:09:25.808 --> 03:09:25.948]  Now,
[03:09:27.742 --> 03:09:34.967]  Some of the Bears did the handlinking and all that, but they didn't stay inside trying to one-up themselves like the Steelers did.
[03:09:34.967 --> 03:09:36.308]  But the Bears did win.
[03:09:36.308 --> 03:09:39.050]  The loser Steelers lost.
[03:09:39.050 --> 03:09:45.335]  The only winner on the Steelers, my friends, is Mr. Vila Nueva.
[03:09:45.335 --> 03:09:46.436]  I tell you.
[03:09:46.436 --> 03:09:49.218]  And again, it's an organized assault on the country.
[03:09:49.218 --> 03:09:52.160]  What did that flag do but pay them $20 million a year salaries?
[03:09:53.723 --> 03:09:55.825]  It symbolizes the better ideas of America.
[03:09:55.825 --> 03:10:03.133]  Sure, you can pick all the bad things in somebody's life, or in a flag's life, or in a country's life, but man, that's the most recognizable flag.
[03:10:03.133 --> 03:10:04.214]  Those colors don't run.
[03:10:04.214 --> 03:10:07.397]  All the tyrants fear it.
[03:10:07.397 --> 03:10:09.359]  And the tyrants have tried to hijack this country.
[03:10:11.135 --> 03:10:28.083]  And only now, when they really try to destroy this country, has it made me love that flag even more, and it pisses me off at a very fundamental level, because it's an outside globalist force that wants to kill our country, coming in here, trying to teach us to hate our own nation, when nobody else would put up with this type of crap in the world.
[03:10:28.083 --> 03:10:32.045]  And these dirtbags use our open, free society to do this, and it pisses me off.
[03:10:32.045 --> 03:10:35.927]  Now, taking over is Matt Dubiel of 1530 WCKG,
[03:10:38.510 --> 03:10:45.895]  And I love him co-hosting with me, and I'm glad he likes to host his own show there and has four children just like I do, and is a great patriot.
[03:10:45.895 --> 03:10:52.639]  And everybody should just spread that link, and everybody should follow him at Matt Dubiel, at Matt, on air, on Twitter as well.
[03:10:52.639 --> 03:10:53.920]  He's a great patriot.
[03:10:53.920 --> 03:10:57.502]  And he doesn't really talk about it on air, but we should have him on for a full hour sometime.
[03:10:57.502 --> 03:10:58.823]  Just the persecution
[03:10:59.463 --> 03:11:03.204]  He's gone through as the manager, but also the owners are patriots.
[03:11:03.204 --> 03:11:08.106]  And they said, you know what, even though you try to get our sponsors and shut us down, we're keeping Alex Jones on.
[03:11:08.106 --> 03:11:11.847]  And they've had, they've been approached by the big syndicators and offered lots of money to take me on.
[03:11:11.847 --> 03:11:12.667]  So this is a war.
[03:11:12.667 --> 03:11:15.068]  This happens to other, it's why I don't list our affiliates.
[03:11:15.068 --> 03:11:21.530]  Some of the old ones, folks who have stuck with us, sometimes 15 years or Matt six, seven or whatever it is, we'll put their station on.
[03:11:21.530 --> 03:11:23.671]  We don't list them all because they get hit folks.
[03:11:23.671 --> 03:11:26.152]  I mean, this is a war and
[03:11:27.389 --> 03:11:30.050]  I only want to say some of the stations I'm on on air.
[03:11:30.050 --> 03:11:33.831]  I mean, we're on in major top five markets.
[03:11:33.831 --> 03:11:37.252]  Top number one markets, I want to say.
[03:11:37.252 --> 03:11:39.412]  I mean, Chicago's big, but it's not the number one market.
[03:11:39.412 --> 03:11:40.893]  It's what, the third, fourth market.
[03:11:40.893 --> 03:11:45.254]  I mean, we're on in the number one market, the number two market, and we're on big stations.
[03:11:45.254 --> 03:11:47.174]  And I've talked to station managers.
[03:11:47.174 --> 03:11:48.535]  They go, no, we did it as a test.
[03:11:48.535 --> 03:11:49.875]  Thank you for keeping your mouth shut.
[03:11:49.875 --> 03:11:52.016]  In fact, I hate it because they get the ratings locally.
[03:11:52.016 --> 03:11:52.896]  They want to be patriots.
[03:11:53.697 --> 03:11:55.939]  But, you know, it's gotten to the point where I love George Norrie.
[03:11:55.939 --> 03:11:59.963]  He still has me on, but I'm on so many stations overnight that they're kind of pressuring, you know, him.
[03:11:59.963 --> 03:12:02.105]  Hey, this guy's on like 50-something stations at night.
[03:12:02.105 --> 03:12:03.546]  I'm not in competition with George Norrie.
[03:12:03.546 --> 03:12:04.647]  He helped kick us off.
[03:12:04.647 --> 03:12:06.049]  Love him coast-to-coast to him.
[03:12:06.049 --> 03:12:08.351]  I think a better executed show than mine.
[03:12:08.351 --> 03:12:09.372]  I love him to death.
[03:12:09.372 --> 03:12:10.733]  The point is, this is a big broadcast.
[03:12:10.733 --> 03:12:11.814]  We're on over 250 affiliates right now, okay?
[03:12:14.056 --> 03:12:15.777]  I gave my tickets away yesterday, Alex.
[03:12:15.777 --> 03:12:16.937]  I had tickets to the Steelers game.
[03:12:41.312 --> 03:12:43.193]  I gave them away.
[03:12:43.193 --> 03:12:47.675]  I got Walter Payton's jersey when I was growing up in the 80s.
[03:12:47.675 --> 03:12:48.875]  The Bears were a big deal.
[03:12:48.875 --> 03:12:49.856]  Me too.
[03:12:49.856 --> 03:12:51.457]  Absolutely, yeah.
[03:12:51.457 --> 03:12:53.117]  The Bears were national.
[03:12:53.117 --> 03:12:55.158]  I mean, it was like people were talking about Walter Payton.
[03:12:55.158 --> 03:12:55.978]  Well, that was America's team.
[03:12:55.978 --> 03:12:56.899]  They became the new Cowboys.
[03:12:57.580 --> 03:12:58.961]  Yeah, they really did.
[03:12:58.961 --> 03:13:01.403]  And it was on Saturday Night Live.
[03:13:01.403 --> 03:13:12.712]  And I didn't go to the game, and I didn't know what was going on with the Steelers until I saw Mr. Villanueva standing outside.
[03:13:12.712 --> 03:13:20.658]  Over the years, you and I have noticed, a lot of people have noticed, the militarization and the propagandizing, if I can make up a word.
[03:13:20.658 --> 03:13:27.123]  The takeover of the NFL, instead of it being Americana, turning into an engine of anti-American crap.
[03:13:28.018 --> 03:13:29.379]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:13:29.379 --> 03:13:40.746]  And, uh, you know, it's interesting that it sort of times out right when the checks from the Department of Defense and the Pentagon stopped flowing to the NFL when they paid to have the fly-by jets.
[03:13:40.746 --> 03:13:42.887]  And I didn't even see that as a Pentagon scandal.
[03:13:42.887 --> 03:13:46.570]  I didn't know all those years they had to pay to have them do that.
[03:13:46.570 --> 03:13:51.113]  And as soon as the Pentagon quit, we found out the NFL is like Hollywood.
[03:13:51.113 --> 03:13:51.633]  Yeah.
[03:13:51.633 --> 03:13:52.974]  As soon as they're not getting a check,
[03:13:53.740 --> 03:13:56.623]  They're not going to pretend to like America.
[03:13:56.623 --> 03:14:01.488]  Why do you think Hollywood, when it's protected by the military, hates the military?
[03:14:01.488 --> 03:14:02.389]  What the hell's wrong?
[03:14:02.389 --> 03:14:04.431]  Why do they hate America so much?
[03:14:04.431 --> 03:14:05.392]  Why don't they get out?
[03:14:05.392 --> 03:14:09.256]  I know everybody says that, but it's true, like, why do you hate it so much, but you stay here?
[03:14:10.390 --> 03:14:11.391]  I don't understand it.
[03:14:11.391 --> 03:14:16.656]  I don't get what... I don't understand the world that we live in today.
[03:14:16.656 --> 03:14:22.362]  I don't understand how people cannot... I did a video before I got here today.
[03:14:22.362 --> 03:14:26.966]  My neighbor across the street had Bernie signs in his yard for the election.
[03:14:26.966 --> 03:14:28.588]  He's got a flag in his front yard.
[03:14:29.128 --> 03:14:30.669]  I have a flag in my front yard.
[03:14:30.669 --> 03:14:38.352]  I voted for Trump and there's people online... By the way, I've never done it just because I felt like it was kind of grandstanding and all my family has them and stuff, but now I get it.
[03:14:38.352 --> 03:14:40.933]  I'm putting Texas flags up, American flags.
[03:14:40.933 --> 03:14:41.953]  I'm gonna... that's it.
[03:14:43.171 --> 03:14:44.012]  Yeah.
[03:14:44.012 --> 03:14:56.821]  The day of the election, or the day after the election I should say, I went and I put sticker, I put an American flag on the back of my pickup truck, I put the flags on the side, I put the flag back up in our house, and my neighbor had his flag up too.
[03:14:56.821 --> 03:15:00.744]  And we're on the opposite sides of the political spectrum here.
[03:15:00.744 --> 03:15:05.207]  But we agree on one thing, and that's we love our country.
[03:15:08.284 --> 03:15:11.046]  When was it not cool to love your country?
[03:15:11.046 --> 03:15:17.590]  When did you start using the country as the... Well this is globalist brainwashing.
[03:15:17.590 --> 03:15:20.652]  Do these idiots not know what the globalists want us to replace it with?
[03:15:20.652 --> 03:15:25.074]  An unelected technocracy that wants to make us poor?
[03:15:25.074 --> 03:15:27.336]  And then they hate a president that wants to make them rich?
[03:15:27.336 --> 03:15:29.177]  And it's delivering!
[03:15:32.060 --> 03:15:35.343]  I think that we start taking a look at what these players are doing.
[03:15:35.343 --> 03:15:36.684]  You know what?
[03:15:36.684 --> 03:15:47.874]  I wish they would all take a knee and lock arms on the south side of Chicago for all the little kids that have been killed in the fire of gangs and guns and drugs.
[03:15:48.474 --> 03:16:04.389]  I wish Colin would get all his friends and use his leadership to come to the South Side of Chicago with the former President of the United States, who claims to be from the South Side of Chicago, and link arms for those sweet little kids that get caught in the crossfire just the other day.
[03:16:04.389 --> 03:16:13.497]  It happens every day in Chicago, and they have an opportunity to really effect some change and make a difference, but they choose to just grandstand instead.
[03:16:15.748 --> 03:16:17.792]  I know you got a lot to cover, but I didn't get to this today.
[03:16:17.792 --> 03:16:18.473]  I'm going to mention it.
[03:16:18.473 --> 03:16:19.836]  This just came out an hour ago.
[03:16:19.836 --> 03:16:24.625]  They're saying, in two different headlines, in the Hill, it's one of the nastiest groups out there.
[03:16:26.260 --> 03:16:33.604]  That, oh, Ivanka and Jared Kushner used private email while doing government business and then buried the article.
[03:16:33.604 --> 03:16:35.385]  It's a total fake news headline.
[03:16:35.385 --> 03:16:40.127]  They say a month before he got into office, so they wouldn't even have had the emails yet.
[03:16:40.127 --> 03:16:41.388]  It's totally legal.
[03:16:41.388 --> 03:16:42.849]  They just run these lies.
[03:16:42.849 --> 03:16:54.735]  Hillary had secret servers, lied about it, illegal, crushed hard drives with hammers, sold out our secrets, gave North Korea weapons, and then they spit it and say the documents show Trump exchanged the emails
[03:16:55.815 --> 03:17:00.123]  In February, about a month before she became an official government employee.
[03:17:00.123 --> 03:17:02.207]  So there you go, that thing is a fake news.
[03:17:02.207 --> 03:17:03.369]  And then, I want to get your take on that.
[03:17:04.932 --> 03:17:07.693]  That sentencing, he got what, 20-something months?
[03:17:07.693 --> 03:17:21.938]  You get Weiner trying to pick up underage girls, we know that's just part of it, a convicted pedophile still wearing his wedding ring, and Daria pointed out that's because you can bar somebody, not necessarily the Fifth Amendment, but if you're a spouse, from having to testify against a spouse.
[03:17:21.938 --> 03:17:25.079]  So he gets 21 months in prison, and we got some video of that.
[03:17:25.079 --> 03:17:26.380]  What do you make of this?
[03:17:27.793 --> 03:17:35.156]  Could you imagine if your wife got wind, or my wife got wind, of the kind of wiener behavior?
[03:17:35.156 --> 03:17:37.658]  If that was me, my wife would be gone, the kids would be gone.
[03:17:37.658 --> 03:17:39.258]  If it was another woman, she'd be gone!
[03:17:39.258 --> 03:17:41.239]  Underage, she'd kill me!
[03:17:41.239 --> 03:17:41.840]  Right.
[03:17:41.840 --> 03:17:49.843]  And everybody you know would never, it would be worse than having the Scarlet Letter, everybody you know, the doors would close.
[03:17:49.843 --> 03:17:52.505]  They would never talk to you again.
[03:17:52.505 --> 03:17:55.146]  But yet, this guy still has friends, and a wife?
[03:17:57.282 --> 03:18:00.865]  How does that happen?
[03:18:00.865 --> 03:18:04.708]  That goes beyond standing by your man.
[03:18:04.708 --> 03:18:11.193]  Remember during the Lewinsky thing when Hillary said, I'm not some Tammy Wynette going to stand by my man.
[03:18:11.193 --> 03:18:13.215]  What is Huma doing?
[03:18:13.215 --> 03:18:14.296]  What are the rest of them doing?
[03:18:14.296 --> 03:18:14.856]  Well, we know.
[03:18:14.856 --> 03:18:16.918]  It's her culture.
[03:18:16.918 --> 03:18:18.159]  Yeah.
[03:18:18.159 --> 03:18:18.739]  Wow.
[03:18:18.739 --> 03:18:20.240]  Tell us what you got coming up.
[03:18:23.374 --> 03:18:27.300]  Colin Kaepernick needs to check his white privilege.
[03:18:27.300 --> 03:18:30.405]  I'll explain exactly how that works.
[03:18:34.802 --> 03:18:43.090]  The real reason why the NFL is turning on America, and I don't think it has anything to do with the flag, and I don't think it has anything to do with Trump.
[03:18:43.090 --> 03:18:47.533]  I think it's much deeper, and it has a lot to do with the Jimmy Kimmel stuff.
[03:18:47.533 --> 03:18:50.396]  It has a lot to do with Rolling Stone magazine failing.
[03:18:50.396 --> 03:18:52.258]  It has to do with CNN failing.
[03:18:52.258 --> 03:18:54.720]  It's a formula that they repeat, and we'll dive into that.
[03:18:56.499 --> 03:18:58.060]  Well, I'm going to be watching and listening.
[03:18:58.060 --> 03:18:59.541]  Matt DeBiel, you're awesome.
[03:18:59.541 --> 03:19:00.721]  We've got a huge roster of guys.
[03:19:00.721 --> 03:19:04.664]  We need to talk soon about when I get you plugged in, maybe at the same time you're doing your show.
[03:19:04.664 --> 03:19:08.086]  Aren't you doing your show at the same time David Nye's doing his, though?
[03:19:08.086 --> 03:19:08.706]  No.
[03:19:08.706 --> 03:19:09.146]  No.
[03:19:09.146 --> 03:19:12.348]  And we'll do whatever we have to do to make it work.
[03:19:12.348 --> 03:19:16.050]  Well, I'm excited because I want to get you syndicated and a bunch of other people.
[03:19:16.050 --> 03:19:17.451]  It's so exciting.
[03:19:17.451 --> 03:19:20.573]  The platform we built is something that just can't be about me.
[03:19:20.573 --> 03:19:21.733]  God, I can't listen to myself.
[03:19:21.733 --> 03:19:22.674]  I love listening to everybody else.
[03:19:23.374 --> 03:19:25.135]  And so we need to do something big here.
[03:19:25.135 --> 03:19:36.202]  All our stations listening, we love them, we appreciate them, and I know I haven't given them the service they deserve with the years that I'm ragtagged, but we got a bunch of folks hired to try to do the affiliate relations and come out to the stations, you name it.
[03:19:36.202 --> 03:19:40.905]  There's a lot of security issues involved, but we want to thank our affiliates, because they're trying to censor us off the internet.
[03:19:40.905 --> 03:19:45.428]  Now more than ever, our AM and FM affiliates, our team, and TV affiliates as well.
[03:19:47.563 --> 03:19:48.564]  It's been said.
[03:19:48.564 --> 03:19:52.029]  Any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[03:19:52.029 --> 03:19:53.631]  Those times may be near.
[03:19:53.631 --> 03:19:54.532]  Think about it.
[03:19:54.532 --> 03:19:59.139]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[03:19:59.139 --> 03:20:03.785]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[03:20:04.125 --> 03:20:09.928]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[03:20:09.928 --> 03:20:16.632]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[03:20:16.632 --> 03:20:19.194]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[03:20:19.634 --> 03:20:22.436]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[03:21:48.833 --> 03:21:54.155]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:21:54.155 --> 03:21:55.735]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:21:55.735 --> 03:22:04.098]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[03:23:43.943 --> 03:23:44.523]  Mind control.
[03:23:44.523 --> 03:23:51.905]  Corruption of your thoughts.
[03:23:51.905 --> 03:23:54.326]  Destruction of your soul.
[03:24:04.241 --> 03:24:09.824]  That's Alex Jones from the WCKG Studios in suburban Chicago.
[03:24:09.824 --> 03:24:12.786]  We can't go to, you know, the real Chicago.
[03:24:12.786 --> 03:24:14.627]  It's a little dangerous on the south side.
[03:24:14.627 --> 03:24:19.890]  It's nice and protected in the heart of Chicago where the Chicago Bears play.
[03:24:19.890 --> 03:24:21.931]  And everybody's talking.
[03:24:21.931 --> 03:24:23.452]  Everybody's talking about the NFL.
[03:24:23.452 --> 03:24:24.572]  They're talking about football.
[03:24:24.572 --> 03:24:25.873]  They're talking about flags.
[03:24:25.873 --> 03:24:27.174]  They're talking about anthems.
[03:24:28.174 --> 03:24:32.236]  And nobody's talking about Colin Kaepernick's white privilege.
[03:24:32.236 --> 03:24:37.078]  I don't believe in white privilege, naturally, because I'm white, so I'm in denial.
[03:24:37.078 --> 03:24:40.540]  And I don't really understand the concept of white privilege.
[03:24:40.540 --> 03:24:48.903]  Like, I don't understand the concept of many things, like why we all need health insurance and why health insurance should be mandatory.
[03:24:48.903 --> 03:24:52.425]  But we're going to talk about Colin Kaepernick's white privilege.
[03:24:52.425 --> 03:24:53.185]  Yep.
[03:24:53.185 --> 03:24:55.346]  I said Colin Kaepernick.
[03:24:56.124 --> 03:24:58.005]  A black man in America has white privilege.
[03:24:58.005 --> 03:24:58.765]  I'll explain that.
[03:24:58.765 --> 03:25:00.967]  I'll explain exactly what I mean.
[03:25:00.967 --> 03:25:03.028]  I played football growing up.
[03:25:03.028 --> 03:25:04.909]  I think Alex played football growing up.
[03:25:04.909 --> 03:25:07.210]  Many of you played football growing up.
[03:25:07.210 --> 03:25:09.611]  And I played actually for a while through high school.
[03:25:09.611 --> 03:25:11.572]  I played for about 10 years.
[03:25:11.572 --> 03:25:15.134]  And I was thinking about the process of playing football.
[03:25:15.134 --> 03:25:15.574]  That's me.
[03:25:15.574 --> 03:25:19.176]  If you're watching it, Infowars.com slash show.
[03:25:19.176 --> 03:25:19.817]  I'm little number 31.
[03:25:21.438 --> 03:25:26.342]  And those guys that I'm playing against were the entire senior class.
[03:25:26.342 --> 03:25:35.829]  I was at the coin toss in this picture and they're all two or three feet larger, taller than me, bigger and faster and stronger than me in nearly every single way.
[03:25:35.829 --> 03:25:45.397]  But the thing that we all had in common before the game was we would typically be in the end zone or on the sideline during the national anthem.
[03:25:45.397 --> 03:25:48.059]  And I remember this like it was yesterday.
[03:25:48.059 --> 03:25:50.741]  Now, I can't tell you what to do.
[03:25:51.391 --> 03:25:55.012]  The government can't tell you what to do.
[03:25:55.012 --> 03:25:58.014]  Maybe in some situations your boss can tell you what to do.
[03:25:58.014 --> 03:26:03.916]  I'm not suggesting that I have the answer for what you should be doing during the National Anthem.
[03:26:04.676 --> 03:26:07.698]  But I'm just going to share with you what I did during the National Anthem.
[03:26:07.698 --> 03:26:10.219]  And I did this every single game.
[03:26:10.219 --> 03:26:12.721]  And somebody could say, Matt, you're full of it.
[03:26:12.721 --> 03:26:19.464]  I'm here to tell you I'm as serious and authentic in this as I can be.
[03:26:19.464 --> 03:26:23.347]  I remember it because I made it a point every single game.
[03:26:23.347 --> 03:26:24.007]  I'd stand there.
[03:26:24.007 --> 03:26:26.248]  I'd put my hand on my heart.
[03:26:26.248 --> 03:26:30.951]  I'd look at the flag waving and I would think about how grateful I was
[03:26:31.812 --> 03:26:36.635]  For the opportunity to be born in the United States.
[03:26:36.635 --> 03:26:44.641]  How grateful I was, not only to be born in the United States, but to be born in the area I was born in.
[03:26:44.641 --> 03:26:46.962]  To be born to the family I was born to.
[03:26:46.962 --> 03:26:53.207]  I could have been born in the United States, but born in Gary, Indiana, and had difficult challenges.
[03:26:54.082 --> 03:27:00.907]  But I would choose to stand there and observe the flag and observe the National Anthem.
[03:27:00.907 --> 03:27:06.111]  And I would think about all the things that I'm grateful for in my life.
[03:27:06.111 --> 03:27:09.033]  And it's a habit I got out of, frankly.
[03:27:09.033 --> 03:27:17.859]  It wasn't until I returned to that habit, not during the National Anthem, just on a daily basis in general, that wonderful things started happening in my life.
[03:27:17.859 --> 03:27:23.443]  And I was a part of wonderful things because I started thinking about wonderful things.
[03:27:24.454 --> 03:27:30.481]  But I would take the time during that National Anthem and I would think about those things.
[03:27:30.481 --> 03:27:40.312]  And I would spend that minute and 30 seconds or so thinking about all of the blessings and the gifts that were provided.
[03:27:41.218 --> 03:27:57.741]  By people before me, by soldiers, by visionaries, by the people that built the railroad tracks, by the people that built the harbors, by the, uh, the, all the immigrants that, the Japanese and the Italians and the brick workers and the Irishmen and everybody that came before me.
[03:27:57.741 --> 03:27:59.421]  And you're thinking, oh yeah, right.
[03:27:59.421 --> 03:28:01.442]  You were 17 and you were thinking about that stuff.
[03:28:01.442 --> 03:28:04.662]  You're damn straight I was thinking about that stuff.
[03:28:04.662 --> 03:28:08.083]  Every time we had the national anthem.
[03:28:08.083 --> 03:28:09.883]  I stood there and I just thought about those things.
[03:28:11.869 --> 03:28:15.290]  Now, I can't tell you to do that.
[03:28:15.290 --> 03:28:18.592]  I can't tell Colin Kaepernick to do that.
[03:28:18.592 --> 03:28:20.352]  I can't tell him what to do.
[03:28:20.352 --> 03:28:28.136]  But I can tell you that in my opinion, he has every right to do whatever he wants during the game.
[03:28:28.136 --> 03:28:33.838]  And I think our President of the United States pretty much affirmed that.
[03:28:33.838 --> 03:28:39.340]  He didn't call for the government to come and force Colin Kaepernick to stand during the anthem.
[03:28:40.589 --> 03:28:44.410]  He called for Colin's bosses or the bosses of the other people.
[03:28:44.410 --> 03:28:46.491]  You know, Colin doesn't really have a job right now.
[03:28:46.491 --> 03:28:51.613]  He's not playing for an NFL team, so he doesn't have a boss.
[03:28:51.613 --> 03:28:55.235]  He also doesn't have a platform anymore.
[03:28:55.235 --> 03:29:04.018]  But coming up, I'm going to share with you why I think that Colin is in the position he's in of leadership of being in the NFL of of everything.
[03:29:04.918 --> 03:29:13.621]  Specifically, by what people who believe the things that he believes in would classify as white privilege.
[03:29:13.621 --> 03:29:15.462]  And you might be thinking, how can that be?
[03:29:15.462 --> 03:29:17.122]  Are you blind?
[03:29:17.122 --> 03:29:17.782]  I'll explain.
[03:29:17.782 --> 03:29:19.483]  It's coming up next.
[03:29:19.483 --> 03:29:22.604]  Infowars.com slash show from Chicago.
[03:29:36.768 --> 03:29:40.692]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:40.692 --> 03:29:43.375]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:48.385 --> 03:29:52.149]  What exactly is political correctness, and why is it being pushed on the American public?
[03:29:52.149 --> 03:29:58.314]  Well, political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses to control public opinion.
[03:29:58.314 --> 03:30:07.263]  By controlling your opinions, the establishment gets you to not only agree with their agenda, but to also ensure that your government-created viewpoint also influences others in a ripple effect.
[03:30:07.503 --> 03:30:09.925]  This is how the power elite and the government stay in power.
[03:30:09.925 --> 03:30:17.469]  They use psychological manipulation to turn the public into obedient sheeple, and over time, we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception.
[03:30:17.469 --> 03:30:20.872]  But how does political correctness and other deliberate deceptions work?
[03:30:20.872 --> 03:30:30.878]  Well, first, the establishment saturates mass media with their agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted as truth, such as global warming, for example.
[03:30:31.078 --> 03:30:40.270]  Then the establishment suppresses any counter-arguments through their agenda by calling critics kooky, nutjobs, racists, or in the case of man-made climate change, climate deniers.
[03:30:40.270 --> 03:30:46.778]  You can learn more about this tyranny over the minds of men at Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and our YouTube channel, Resistance News.
[03:30:46.778 --> 03:30:47.960]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:30:48.345 --> 03:30:50.227]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[03:30:50.227 --> 03:30:52.248]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[03:30:52.248 --> 03:30:55.171]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[03:30:55.171 --> 03:31:01.236]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[03:31:01.236 --> 03:31:10.425]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:31:10.425 --> 03:31:15.289]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[03:31:15.509 --> 03:31:17.952]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[03:31:17.952 --> 03:31:25.980]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[03:31:25.980 --> 03:31:27.061]  The general public doesn't.
[03:31:28.152 --> 03:31:32.097]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[03:31:32.097 --> 03:31:35.682]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[03:31:35.682 --> 03:31:42.390]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[03:31:48.775 --> 03:31:53.500]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[03:31:53.500 --> 03:32:03.712]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases,
[03:32:03.712 --> 03:32:07.154]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists, we're getting results and we're expanding in the face of
[03:32:33.049 --> 03:32:33.410]  We're good.
[03:32:50.996 --> 03:33:01.388]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:01.388 --> 03:33:06.274]  I watch people with real problems in the United States of America.
[03:33:06.274 --> 03:33:08.056]  You look at, and that includes Puerto Rico.
[03:33:08.776 --> 03:33:17.442]  You look at Puerto Rico, you look at Florida, you look at Texas, and there's people that are having real problems, real actual issues.
[03:33:17.442 --> 03:33:19.983]  They're trying to get food and they're trying to get water.
[03:33:19.983 --> 03:33:24.987]  And those are the people that we should be thinking about and praying for right now.
[03:33:24.987 --> 03:33:29.730]  Before that happens to you, we don't know what's coming, but we can start getting ready for whatever may happen.
[03:33:29.730 --> 03:33:34.233]  That could be a natural disaster, that could be something you just don't know.
[03:33:34.233 --> 03:33:37.715]  And look in your cupboard right now and ask yourself, do you have
[03:33:38.464 --> 03:33:39.325]  Three days of food?
[03:33:39.325 --> 03:33:40.447]  Do you have a week's worth of food?
[03:33:40.447 --> 03:33:41.188]  Do you have any food?
[03:33:41.188 --> 03:33:44.132]  Do you have anything besides a couple of things of ramen?
[03:33:44.132 --> 03:33:45.474]  Chances are you don't.

[03:34:18.571 --> 03:34:19.911]  My name is Matt Dubio, by the way.
[03:34:19.911 --> 03:34:23.392]  Filling in for Alex from WCKG in Chicago.
[03:34:24.092 --> 03:34:25.773]  And really, we're in the suburbs here.
[03:34:25.773 --> 03:34:40.704]  We're an arm's length away from the shenanigans that is plaguing the South Side of Chicago, where I wish Colin Kaepernick and the rest of the football players that are speaking out, I don't even know what they're speaking out against anymore, and I don't think most people do.
[03:34:40.704 --> 03:34:42.325]  I think that's part of the problem.
[03:34:42.325 --> 03:34:43.586]  Much like the Bucket Challenge.
[03:34:43.586 --> 03:34:45.207]  Remember the Bucket Challenge?
[03:34:45.207 --> 03:34:46.628]  Do you remember what it was for?
[03:34:47.446 --> 03:34:48.586]  Did it cure anything?
[03:34:48.586 --> 03:34:50.307]  A lot of people did a lot of stuff.
[03:34:50.307 --> 03:34:52.588]  A lot of people talked about a lot of stuff.
[03:34:52.588 --> 03:34:59.971]  And then you look back afterwards, like Lollapalooza in Chicago, after the concert's over, there's garbage everywhere.
[03:34:59.971 --> 03:35:01.792]  And somebody's got to clean up the mess.
[03:35:01.792 --> 03:35:05.373]  That's what's going to happen with this situation.
[03:35:05.373 --> 03:35:06.754]  There's a lot of people talking.
[03:35:06.754 --> 03:35:08.334]  There's a lot of people arguing.
[03:35:08.334 --> 03:35:11.235]  There's a lot of, oh, this side versus that side.
[03:35:13.999 --> 03:35:15.880]  Can we be on the same side?
[03:35:15.880 --> 03:35:19.701]  Because the side that I'm on is very simple.
[03:35:19.701 --> 03:35:27.584]  Number one, in the United States of America, thanks to the Constitution, we have the right to freedom of speech.
[03:35:27.584 --> 03:35:33.707]  Now, that means the government isn't going to come down, isn't supposed to come down on you.
[03:35:33.707 --> 03:35:36.208]  That doesn't mean that your neighbor isn't.
[03:35:36.208 --> 03:35:38.969]  That doesn't mean you're free from consequences.
[03:35:38.969 --> 03:35:39.849]  That means that
[03:35:40.695 --> 03:35:51.409]  On its surface, Colin Kaepernick has every right and all the other football players have every right to take a knee during a football game.
[03:35:51.409 --> 03:35:54.814]  Here's why I believe what our president did was pretty masterful.
[03:35:56.012 --> 03:35:59.614]  And the results are going to be certainly that people are going to harden against him.
[03:35:59.614 --> 03:36:01.654]  There's going to be more people that act out.
[03:36:01.654 --> 03:36:11.298]  There's going to be more people that side against him and use this as a unification to galvanize against the President and against this political party or that political party.
[03:36:11.298 --> 03:36:17.501]  But another thing is going to happen, and it always does, in the greatest country on planet Earth.
[03:36:17.501 --> 03:36:22.223]  And that is, people will get behind what they believe in.
[03:36:23.303 --> 03:36:24.924]  And there's an example of that.
[03:36:24.924 --> 03:36:26.504]  And I want to share that example with you.
[03:36:26.504 --> 03:36:30.946]  This happened shortly after the Boston bombing.
[03:36:30.946 --> 03:36:34.728]  And it was, I'm told that it was a miraculous event.
[03:36:34.728 --> 03:36:35.508]  It wasn't planned.
[03:36:35.508 --> 03:36:36.549]  It wasn't orchestrated.
[03:36:37.453 --> 03:36:39.274]  Uh, and I think more things like this are going to happen.
[03:36:39.274 --> 03:36:51.882]  I think you're going to find, uh, perhaps guys like Alex or me or so and other people that are, uh, believe in supporting the country and supporting the anthem and standing for the anthem and those sorts of things.
[03:36:51.882 --> 03:36:57.526]  They're going to take an opportunity to lead their followers and their fans and their listeners in a way.
[03:36:57.526 --> 03:36:59.167]  And maybe they'll start playing the national anthem.
[03:36:59.167 --> 03:37:06.412]  You know, as a radio station owner, TV station owners and radio station owners used to have to play the national anthem.
[03:37:06.992 --> 03:37:08.834]  At sign-on and sign-off.
[03:37:08.834 --> 03:37:12.017]  Back when your stations used to sign on and sign off.
[03:37:12.017 --> 03:37:15.820]  In fact, you'll see it if you watch like the movie Poltergeist.
[03:37:15.820 --> 03:37:22.806]  One of the things in the original Poltergeist was when the TV was on in the middle of the night, you saw the flag and you saw the national anthem.
[03:37:22.806 --> 03:37:24.707]  That was just the way.
[03:37:24.707 --> 03:37:26.889]  And then we kind of got away from that.
[03:37:26.889 --> 03:37:29.011]  And then people started arguing out, can you burn the flag?
[03:37:29.011 --> 03:37:30.613]  Can you not burn the flag?
[03:37:30.613 --> 03:37:31.613]  Do you have to stand?
[03:37:31.613 --> 03:37:33.375]  Do you have to say in God we trust?
[03:37:33.375 --> 03:37:34.536]  No, you don't have to do anything.
[03:37:35.305 --> 03:37:36.406]  You can do what you want.
[03:37:36.406 --> 03:37:39.148]  That's the beauty of America.
[03:37:39.148 --> 03:37:44.692]  President Trump is saying, so can the owners, so can the league.
[03:37:44.692 --> 03:37:46.613]  And they've done that in the past.
[03:37:46.613 --> 03:38:02.905]  They fined one of my favorite players of all time, Walter Payton, number 34 from the Chicago Bears, Jim McMahon from the Chicago Bears, the Super Bowl champion Chicago Bears, had to pay fines because they wore headbands that said, Adidas.
[03:38:04.326 --> 03:38:09.209]  Or headbands that said, I forget who, maybe it was Jim McMahon that was sponsored by Adidas.
[03:38:09.209 --> 03:38:11.110]  Walter Payton was sponsored by Roos.
[03:38:11.110 --> 03:38:16.732]  And if you Google Walter Payton and Roos, you'll see his headband that says Roos.
[03:38:16.732 --> 03:38:18.633]  And then you'll see what he did after that.
[03:38:18.633 --> 03:38:19.834]  A man of class.
[03:38:19.834 --> 03:38:25.257]  You'll also see some pictures of Walter Payton and Jim McMahon embracing each other and as teammates.
[03:38:25.257 --> 03:38:26.017]  Loving each other.
[03:38:26.017 --> 03:38:29.419]  Just being teammates.
[03:38:29.419 --> 03:38:30.340]  Fellow Americans.
[03:38:30.340 --> 03:38:30.840]  Fellow Bears.
[03:38:32.051 --> 03:38:38.734]  But what Walter did was he wrote the Commissioner's name after he got fined on his headband.
[03:38:38.734 --> 03:38:39.835]  He was playful.
[03:38:39.835 --> 03:38:46.138]  But they got fined because they didn't follow the procedures and the policies of the NFL.
[03:38:46.138 --> 03:38:50.160]  And the NFL, by the way, is a non-profit entity!
[03:38:50.160 --> 03:38:55.002]  They enjoy tax-exempt status, as far as I understand it, and have for some time.
[03:38:56.027 --> 03:39:04.713]  They have a set of rules and policies, and according to the one I saw, one of the policies is players are supposed to stand for the National Anthem.
[03:39:04.713 --> 03:39:06.794]  They're supposed to have their helmet held a certain way.
[03:39:06.794 --> 03:39:11.017]  That's why there are flags on the back of the helmets.
[03:39:11.017 --> 03:39:17.041]  Now, I wonder what's going to happen next month, October.
[03:39:17.041 --> 03:39:19.222]  We're just a few days away from October.
[03:39:19.222 --> 03:39:20.383]  Why is October important?
[03:39:21.590 --> 03:39:46.087]  Well, in October, it's Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and there is a massive, massive tag-team effort between the NFL, a super-huge media company really is what it is, and the Susan G. Komen Foundation, or whatever they call it, another designated tax-exempt operation.
[03:39:46.087 --> 03:39:47.988]  And you're going to see players wear pink socks,
[03:39:48.672 --> 03:39:50.773]  You're going to see players wear pink jerseys.
[03:39:50.773 --> 03:39:53.254]  You're going to see players have pink towels.
[03:39:53.254 --> 03:39:56.515]  You're going to see stories about moms and breast cancer and stuff.
[03:39:56.515 --> 03:39:58.636]  And that's great.
[03:39:58.636 --> 03:40:00.156]  It raises awareness for breast cancer.
[03:40:00.156 --> 03:40:07.739]  It also puts a lot of money into Susan G. Komen's foundation and the NFL.
[03:40:07.739 --> 03:40:15.002]  And a lot of that money does not come back to the United States of America via taxes because they're tax-exempt.
[03:40:16.818 --> 03:40:40.382]  It reminds me, it reminds me of another time, back a few years ago, when the Pentagon paid 53 million dollars, 53 million bucks, to 14 different NFL teams, for product placement just like the Breast Cancer Awareness Program, which Susan G Komen pays the NFL for.
[03:40:40.382 --> 03:40:43.222]  That's how that works.
[03:40:43.222 --> 03:40:45.963]  Well, the government, the Department of Defense and the Pentagon,
[03:40:46.733 --> 03:40:49.254]  Used to pay the NFL.
[03:40:49.254 --> 03:40:51.255]  A lot of money.
[03:40:51.255 --> 03:40:52.676]  53 some million dollars.
[03:40:52.676 --> 03:40:57.778]  14 teams to the tune of 5.4 million dollars.
[03:40:57.778 --> 03:41:01.660]  And what did the government pay them for?
[03:41:01.660 --> 03:41:05.182]  They paid them to do military flybys.
[03:41:05.182 --> 03:41:14.886]  They paid the NFL to feature and encourage the crowd to support soldiers and servicemen and women.
[03:41:16.946 --> 03:41:24.835]  The NFL was paid to behave as though they give a crap about the United States of America.
[03:41:24.835 --> 03:41:27.959]  So one of two things is happening now.
[03:41:27.959 --> 03:41:33.485]  Either they're still getting paid, and they're doing a very bad job.
[03:41:33.485 --> 03:41:37.750]  Or the more likely, which is, they're no longer getting paid.
[03:41:38.675 --> 03:41:40.095]  By the government.
[03:41:40.095 --> 03:41:41.256]  By the Pentagon.
[03:41:41.256 --> 03:41:43.056]  By the Department of Defense.
[03:41:43.056 --> 03:41:46.837]  The NFL is no longer getting paid to promote patriotism.
[03:41:46.837 --> 03:41:49.838]  The NFL is no longer getting paid to promote the government.
[03:41:49.838 --> 03:41:53.719]  The NFL is no longer getting paid to promote enrolling and enlisting.
[03:41:53.719 --> 03:42:06.962]  The NFL is no longer getting paid like they were to get everybody to stand and congratulate soldiers, servicemen, and women.
[03:42:06.962 --> 03:42:07.362]  So now,
[03:42:08.123 --> 03:42:13.386]  There's an investigation into the concussions, into the... whatever you... there's an acronym for it.
[03:42:13.386 --> 03:42:19.229]  The disease that the NFL players are getting from kits to the head over and over and over again.
[03:42:19.229 --> 03:42:26.353]  There's a movie about it that was kind of hushed up.
[03:42:26.353 --> 03:42:29.134]  The government is investigating the NFL.
[03:42:29.134 --> 03:42:31.736]  People are suing the NFL.
[03:42:31.736 --> 03:42:33.436]  And so it seems to me there's a rift.
[03:42:35.842 --> 03:42:38.704]  Between the NFL and the United States government.
[03:42:38.704 --> 03:42:41.227]  That's what this is about.
[03:42:41.227 --> 03:42:51.495]  This is about the NFL saying to the government, well, you know, you're not paying us 53 million dollars anymore.
[03:42:51.495 --> 03:42:54.497]  So we're going to make it painful.
[03:42:54.497 --> 03:42:57.240]  Amazing things happen when you follow the money.
[03:42:57.240 --> 03:43:00.903]  Follow the money, follow the money, follow the money.
[03:43:00.903 --> 03:43:04.786]  What are they going to do when Susan G Komen stops paying their VIG?
[03:43:05.689 --> 03:43:13.216]  What is the NFL gonna do when Susan G. Komen and the money from Susan G. Komen and all their partners stops coming through?
[03:43:13.216 --> 03:43:24.785]  Are they gonna turn on their breast cancer awareness programs like they have on the United States government patriotism program?
[03:43:24.785 --> 03:43:26.027]  Because that's what happened.
[03:43:26.027 --> 03:43:32.152]  And that's what makes the NFL look like a bunch of high-priced prostitutes.
[03:43:34.474 --> 03:43:37.375]  And what does that have to do with Colin Kaepernick?
[03:43:37.375 --> 03:43:41.417]  Well, he's, I mean, you know, he's the guy that started it all.
[03:43:41.417 --> 03:43:43.578]  He's the leader.
[03:43:43.578 --> 03:43:45.619]  Not the leader they deserve, but the one they got.
[03:43:45.619 --> 03:43:48.421]  Is that how that goes?
[03:43:48.421 --> 03:43:53.383]  And gosh, if only he would use his powers for good instead of ridiculousness.
[03:43:55.066 --> 03:44:07.049]  If only he realized how much power he has in leadership he has to get a movement started and then directed that movement to actually affect change.
[03:44:07.049 --> 03:44:17.332]  Wouldn't it be great if a bunch of big strong NFL players locked arms around the tiny vulnerable children that are in the worst areas of Chicago and Detroit?
[03:44:17.332 --> 03:44:22.974]  Wouldn't it be great if all of the NFL players that are that are too important and too
[03:44:25.143 --> 03:44:29.525]  Vital to the movement, whatever their movement is, to stand for the National Anthem.
[03:44:29.525 --> 03:44:34.867]  Wouldn't it be great if they all went down to Florida when the cameras were on?
[03:44:34.867 --> 03:44:38.709]  Or if they all went down to Texas when the cameras were on?
[03:44:38.709 --> 03:44:40.950]  They're not going to do that.
[03:44:40.950 --> 03:44:45.612]  And there's a reason why the NFL is being ransacked, essentially.
[03:44:45.612 --> 03:44:49.954]  There's a reason why Rolling Stone Magazine has been ransacked, essentially.
[03:44:50.959 --> 03:44:53.981]  This stuff doesn't really happen until the popularity wanes.
[03:44:53.981 --> 03:44:55.221]  It's happening at ESPN.
[03:44:55.221 --> 03:44:56.662]  It happened at CNN.
[03:44:56.662 --> 03:45:12.471]  When they're not as popular anymore, that's when they get desperate and that's when they take sponsorships or opportunities or take on causes to get attention and maybe get them out of the red zone.
[03:45:12.471 --> 03:45:14.032]  Maybe get them off of life support.
[03:45:15.046 --> 03:45:16.807]  CNN's on life support.
[03:45:16.807 --> 03:45:19.008]  Rolling Stone Magazine's on life support.
[03:45:19.008 --> 03:45:24.551]  Jimmy Kimmel's show on ABC is on life support.
[03:45:24.551 --> 03:45:25.792]  There's more.
[03:45:25.792 --> 03:45:28.573]  The NFL is on life support.
[03:45:28.573 --> 03:45:29.814]  Go to a stadium.
[03:45:29.814 --> 03:45:34.837]  Professional sports is on life support in a lot of ways.
[03:45:34.837 --> 03:45:39.979]  That's when the messaging, the cheap messaging, because they get vulnerable, they go like, oh, well, what are we going to do?
[03:45:39.979 --> 03:45:41.480]  Well, we might as well use this thing.
[03:45:41.480 --> 03:45:42.621]  It reminds me of Goodfellas.
[03:45:44.258 --> 03:45:53.303]  When in Goodfellas, the movie Goodfellas, when the mob would take over a business or a restaurant, they'd jack up the credit and they would go buy things.
[03:45:53.303 --> 03:45:54.683]  They would buy merchandise.
[03:45:54.683 --> 03:45:59.806]  They'd bring it in the front door, and then they'd bring it out the back door and sell it.
[03:45:59.806 --> 03:46:10.812]  And when the credit was risen to the gills, as Henry Hill would say in the movie Goodfellas and in the story, there was only one thing left to do, and that was bust up the joint.
[03:46:12.364 --> 03:46:19.186]  In other words, they bought mink coats and they bought fancy things on credit.
[03:46:19.186 --> 03:46:22.467]  They sold it out the back door like it just fell off a truck.
[03:46:22.467 --> 03:46:25.787]  They pocketed the cash and they didn't want to pay the tab.
[03:46:25.787 --> 03:46:27.488]  They didn't want to pay the piper.
[03:46:27.488 --> 03:46:28.908]  So what do they do?
[03:46:28.908 --> 03:46:30.749]  They bust up the joint.
[03:46:30.749 --> 03:46:31.689]  At that point, they don't care.
[03:46:32.805 --> 03:46:33.886]  That's what's happening.
[03:46:33.886 --> 03:46:35.908]  It's happening right now to Rolling Stone.
[03:46:35.908 --> 03:46:36.648]  It's happening.
[03:46:36.648 --> 03:46:38.130]  It happened to the Washington Post.
[03:46:38.130 --> 03:46:39.471]  It's happening to the New York Times.
[03:46:39.471 --> 03:46:41.012]  It's happening to CNN.
[03:46:41.012 --> 03:46:44.055]  It's happening to the Jimmy Kimmel Show.
[03:46:44.055 --> 03:46:49.219]  It's happening across the board, and that's how you know it's a dangerous time.
[03:46:49.219 --> 03:46:57.506]  Because the more desperate they get for eardrums and eyeballs and ratings and revenue, the more compromised they become.
[03:46:57.506 --> 03:46:58.267]  But there's an upside.
[03:47:00.107 --> 03:47:03.590]  And we'll talk about Colin Kaepernick's white privilege, don't worry.
[03:47:03.590 --> 03:47:06.192]  I'm sure people are ticked off.
[03:47:06.192 --> 03:47:10.254]  As it is, people were leaving some weird comments last week.
[03:47:10.254 --> 03:47:11.956]  We'll get into that coming up in the next segment.
[03:47:11.956 --> 03:47:29.268]  But one of the upsides to the downside, which is people will galvanize against the things that many of us hold dear, people will galvanize against the President and many of the things that many of us support, is people will also, good people, smart people,
[03:47:30.248 --> 03:47:34.050]  Confident people will also begin to do some of the right things.
[03:47:34.050 --> 03:47:37.152]  And we have to find those things and echo them and amplify them.
[03:47:37.152 --> 03:47:43.836]  And one of those things happened after the Boston bombing.
[03:47:43.836 --> 03:47:45.837]  And this was a miraculous thing.
[03:47:45.837 --> 03:47:47.858]  So I'm going to kill two birds with one stone here.
[03:47:47.858 --> 03:47:49.439]  I'm going to play the national anthem.
[03:47:50.919 --> 03:47:53.341]  And I'm going to share with you something that is emotional.
[03:47:53.341 --> 03:47:58.885]  I mean, you almost have to be dead inside not to get emotional when you hear this National Anthem.
[03:47:58.885 --> 03:48:02.168]  It was after something happened in our country.
[03:48:02.168 --> 03:48:06.171]  And people responded in a way that nobody expected.
[03:48:06.171 --> 03:48:08.172]  And it's touching.
[03:48:08.172 --> 03:48:13.256]  And I encourage you to observe the National Anthem in whatever way you see fit.
[03:48:13.256 --> 03:48:15.458]  But no matter what, I'm playing it.
[03:48:15.458 --> 03:48:20.402]  And this is the Bruins fans taking over the National Anthem in Boston after the Boston bombing.
[03:48:22.924 --> 03:48:42.872]  Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
[03:48:42.872 --> 03:48:46.253]  Whose broad stripes and bright stars
[03:48:57.713 --> 03:48:58.138]  We're good.
[03:49:50.763 --> 03:49:53.225]  Did you feel that?
[03:49:53.225 --> 03:49:55.867]  I mean, you feel that.
[03:49:55.867 --> 03:49:56.688]  You feel it.
[03:49:56.688 --> 03:49:58.969]  Like, I felt it.
[03:49:58.969 --> 03:50:01.711]  I feel like a tingle.
[03:50:01.711 --> 03:50:03.373]  In my temples.
[03:50:03.373 --> 03:50:06.535]  In my heart, in my chest.
[03:50:06.535 --> 03:50:10.818]  If you don't feel that, I don't know what you're doing here.
[03:50:10.818 --> 03:50:11.959]  I don't know.
[03:50:11.959 --> 03:50:14.261]  I'm not saying you don't belong here.
[03:50:14.261 --> 03:50:16.002]  I'm just saying I don't know what you're doing here.
[03:50:16.002 --> 03:50:16.963]  I don't understand it.
[03:50:16.963 --> 03:50:19.965]  If you don't feel that, we need more of that.
[03:50:20.712 --> 03:50:22.733]  You and I together.
[03:50:22.733 --> 03:50:25.913]  That's the magic of the United States of America.
[03:50:25.913 --> 03:50:28.094]  And that wins.

[03:53:42.370 --> 03:53:43.770]  Matt Dufield, Alex Jones, from Chicago.
[03:54:06.151 --> 03:54:08.132]  It's time to come together.
[03:54:08.132 --> 03:54:11.475]  It's not easy to come together because we're so divided.
[03:54:11.475 --> 03:54:14.518]  We're taking up an argument that really doesn't exist.
[03:54:14.518 --> 03:54:25.787]  If you look at it and you look at who's making the arguments, as Mick Jagger said back in, I don't know if it was the 60s or the 70s, who are we fighting and what for?
[03:54:25.787 --> 03:54:28.709]  Who are we fighting and what for?
[03:54:28.709 --> 03:54:29.450]  Nobody knows.
[03:54:29.450 --> 03:54:30.611]  They're arguing because they're
[03:54:31.232 --> 03:54:34.653]  Bend out of shape because everybody's looking for something.
[03:54:34.653 --> 03:54:40.674]  Everybody's searching for their cause because everybody's got a lot of time at the Facebook and on the Twitter.
[03:54:40.674 --> 03:54:46.855]  They've got a lot of time to say a lot of stuff because they're not busy enough because there's not enough tragedy in their life.
[03:54:46.855 --> 03:54:53.537]  Some on the left and I hate saying that I hate I hate the whole on the left and you know the snowflake thing.
[03:54:53.537 --> 03:54:55.957]  I don't like calling people names.
[03:54:55.957 --> 03:55:00.278]  But there is a group of people in America that believe in this thing called white privilege.
[03:55:01.081 --> 03:55:06.544]  And this is the part where I tell you Colin Kaepernick needs to check his white privilege.
[03:55:06.544 --> 03:55:12.868]  And people that believe in this white privilege nonsense say, well, of course you don't believe in it because you're white!
[03:55:12.868 --> 03:55:14.749]  Oh yeah?
[03:55:14.749 --> 03:55:20.173]  Tell the guy that shouted at me the other day and called me an effing Mexican.
[03:55:20.173 --> 03:55:23.575]  Tell the guy before him that called me some other names.
[03:55:23.575 --> 03:55:27.217]  People don't know what I am, depending on what I'm wearing and how I shave.
[03:55:28.212 --> 03:55:39.742]  Now that's not the same as the oppression and persecution that the Irish and the Italians and the Japanese and the black Americans have experienced over the years.
[03:55:39.742 --> 03:55:41.243]  I get it.
[03:55:41.243 --> 03:55:48.589]  But Colin Kaepernick has lived, if you believe in white privilege, Colin Kaepernick has lived a life of white privilege.
[03:55:48.589 --> 03:55:49.710]  I don't believe it.
[03:55:49.710 --> 03:55:51.311]  I don't buy that crap.
[03:55:51.311 --> 03:55:55.415]  But Colin was born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.
[03:55:56.477 --> 03:56:06.667]  His mom is white, his father is black, his father left, his mom gave him up for adoption, and he was adopted by a white family in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.
[03:56:06.667 --> 03:56:07.488]  Nothing wrong with that!
[03:56:07.488 --> 03:56:08.148]  God bless him!
[03:56:08.148 --> 03:56:10.170]  Thank God he was adopted!
[03:56:10.170 --> 03:56:13.753]  Thank God somebody found him and treated him right.
[03:56:13.753 --> 03:56:18.538]  Then they moved to California when he was young.
[03:56:18.538 --> 03:56:21.461]  And the article that I read at MSESPN
[03:56:22.637 --> 03:56:36.229]  Talked about how his adopted mother, who defends him vehemently on the social media, and his biological mother has actually chastised him on social media publicly.
[03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:49.521]  But in the article I read at MSESPN, the quote from his mom was, we never tried to raise Colin White, but we would drive sometimes up to 60 minutes to get him cornrows.
[03:56:52.481 --> 03:56:55.842]  Then Colin went to college as an elite athlete.
[03:56:55.842 --> 03:56:58.903]  Colin went to the NFL as an elite athlete.
[03:56:58.903 --> 03:57:03.344]  And he lived a life of white privilege leading up to that.
[03:57:03.344 --> 03:57:07.125]  Thank God for that white privilege.
[03:57:07.125 --> 03:57:08.906]  What does that have to do with the flag?
[03:57:08.906 --> 03:57:10.066]  What does that have to do with us?
[03:57:10.066 --> 03:57:14.887]  What does that have to do with the kids on the South Side of Chicago that don't have that same privilege?
[03:57:14.887 --> 03:57:18.608]  Well, it puts Colin in a position where he can throw away a $120 million contract.
[03:57:23.188 --> 03:57:26.189]  Like it's nothing.
[03:57:26.189 --> 03:57:38.434]  There's kids in the hood, there's kids in the suburbs that are working on their jump shot, and they're working on their passing, and they're working on their routes right now, praying for that miracle.
[03:57:38.434 --> 03:57:47.297]  Praying for the God-given talent and the opportunity that Colin was given as part of his white privilege.
[03:57:47.297 --> 03:57:48.998]  Colin needs to check his white privilege.
[03:57:50.882 --> 03:57:56.244]  And everybody else needs to watch carefully what everyone else does in the next weeks and months.
[03:57:56.244 --> 03:57:59.545]  Because that's going to really dictate how this whole thing goes down.
[03:57:59.545 --> 03:58:03.567]  Thank God the President, in my opinion, has acted accordingly.
[03:58:03.567 --> 03:58:05.768]  He didn't say the government should step in.
[03:58:05.768 --> 03:58:08.068]  He didn't say the people should step in.
[03:58:08.068 --> 03:58:12.310]  He said the people in charge, the coaches, the owners should step in.
[03:58:12.310 --> 03:58:13.631]  That's how it's supposed to work.
[03:58:13.631 --> 03:58:16.111]  The government stays out.
[03:58:16.111 --> 03:58:18.012]  The government stays out.
[03:58:18.012 --> 03:58:19.813]  The government stays out.
[03:58:20.723 --> 03:58:29.948]  We stay free.
[03:58:29.948 --> 03:58:33.930]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
