[00:00:02.395 --> 00:00:10.900]  North Korea, I'll tell you what, what's happening there is disgraceful, and not smart, not smart at all.
[00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:18.125]  So many different problems, and I'll tell you, you see what's happening with the economy?
[00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:26.730]  We picked up $3 trillion in value, and our companies are bringing people back to work.
[00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:39.838]  We have to take on every special interest that has profited from the... And I mean, I don't mean like a little bit.
[00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:43.939]  I mean really terrible trade deals.
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.541]  Horrible trade deals.
[00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:55.684]  Last year, our country lost almost 800 billion dollars in trade.
[00:00:56.205 --> 00:00:57.785]  Not gonna happen anymore, folks.
[00:00:57.945 --> 00:00:59.046]  Not gonna happen anymore.
[00:01:01.758 --> 00:01:06.121]  Uncontrolled immigration, you see what's going on there, that's happening quickly.
[00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:14.486]  A little problem with the courts, not wanting to give us the decisions that should be given, but we're gonna win it.
[00:01:15.927 --> 00:01:21.230]  And a financial system stacked against the American people.
[00:01:22.403 --> 00:01:39.110]  These entrenched interests will do anything they can to keep the broken system in place, but they will fail and we will win because we are fighting on this side of our great American heritage.
[00:01:51.036 --> 00:01:51.996]  This place is packed.
[00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:03.212]  I mean, I don't want to say this.
[00:02:04.132 --> 00:02:07.393]  We could have been watching a good basketball game tonight, right?
[00:02:07.413 --> 00:02:08.134]  What happened?
[00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:10.114]  What happened?
[00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:12.795]  That's alright.
[00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:15.436]  You've done a good job, right?
[00:02:15.676 --> 00:02:16.557]  You've done a good job.
[00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:19.918]  Great team, great coach.
[00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:21.098]  It's alright.
[00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.941]  We are going to drain the swamp of government corruption in Washington, D.C.
[00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.774]  And we are going to keep our promises, all of the promises that we made.
[00:02:36.354 --> 00:02:40.397]  We are going to massively reduce your taxes.
[00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:54.766]  We are going to reduce very substantially rising crime and support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.
[00:02:59.628 --> 00:03:11.838]  We're going to bring accountability to the VA and take great care, finally, finally, finally, of our great veterans.
[00:03:20.445 --> 00:03:25.830]  And our secretary, you wouldn't believe it, because I still don't have my cabinet!
[00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.492]  They won't approve my cabinet!
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.383]  There is a lot of division and a lot of bad stuff going on in this country.
[00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:44.367]  But I'll tell you, David, we love David, David got approved 100 to nothing.
[00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:45.167]  Can you believe it?
[00:03:45.587 --> 00:03:46.288]  Head of the VA.
[00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.811]  And you watch what happens with the veterans.
[00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:56.333]  It's time, it's time we take care of our veterans.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.463]  We are going to rebuild the United States military, finally.
[00:04:06.483 --> 00:04:23.210]  I proposed a budget that calls for one of the largest increases in defense spending history, and we need it.
[00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.631]  We need it.
[00:04:24.651 --> 00:04:27.572]  Got a lot of bad actors out there, folks, right?
[00:04:28.908 --> 00:04:30.068]  That's time also.
[00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.171]  And it's also jobs, because we're going to make this equipment right here in the USA.
[00:04:39.252 --> 00:04:42.814]  And we believe in three crucial words.
[00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:46.255]  Peace through strength.
[00:04:46.335 --> 00:04:57.920]  Here's our great Lieutenant Governor, by the way, please.
[00:05:00.512 --> 00:05:01.032]  Thank you, darling.
[00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:01.592]  Thank you.
[00:05:05.693 --> 00:05:14.896]  But we will spend our money wisely with just one negotiation on one set of airplanes.
[00:05:15.876 --> 00:05:23.078]  I saved the taxpayers of our country over 700 million dollars.
[00:05:23.098 --> 00:05:28.619]  And that's just one of many.
[00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.212]  One of many.
[00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:40.233]  We've also kept our promise to appoint a Supreme Court Justice who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[00:05:47.074 --> 00:05:59.338]  Judge Neil Gorsuch's hearing is now underway in the Senate, and I urge members of both parties to swiftly approve his nomination.
[00:05:59.398 --> 00:06:07.601]  He is an outstanding man from an outstanding family with an unbelievably wonderful wife.
[00:06:08.161 --> 00:06:08.901]  They should approve.
[00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:18.669]  There's another promise that is deeply important to me, and I know it is deeply important to you.
[00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.416]  We are going to put our coal miners back to work.
[00:06:33.214 --> 00:06:36.376]  They have not been treated well, but they're going to be treated well now.
[00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:38.438]  Clean coal, right?
[00:06:38.638 --> 00:06:39.939]  Clean coal.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.343]  I have already eliminated a devastating anti-coal regulation.
[00:06:47.164 --> 00:06:48.785]  And that is just the beginning.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.280]  You saw that.
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:56.363]  We got a lot of thank yous from a lot of great people that work very hard and want to keep working.
[00:06:56.383 --> 00:06:58.224]  A lot of people are going to be put back to work.
[00:06:58.264 --> 00:07:00.205]  A lot of coal miners are going back to work.
[00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:14.612]  As we speak, we are preparing new executive actions to save our coal industry and to save our wonderful coal miners from continuing to be put out of work.
[00:07:15.212 --> 00:07:17.113]  The miners are coming back.
[00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:41.517]  Our new EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, a Kentucky native, will turn the EPA, environmental, will turn the EPA from a job killer into a job creator.
[00:07:41.557 --> 00:07:42.038]  You watch.
[00:07:48.467 --> 00:07:53.811]  Since my inauguration, we've already added nearly a half a million new jobs.
[00:07:54.412 --> 00:07:55.973]  And that's, believe me, just the beginning.
[00:07:57.674 --> 00:07:58.395]  Just the beginning.
[00:08:01.117 --> 00:08:05.781]  And I don't know, do you see those consumer confidence levels, Matt?
[00:08:06.041 --> 00:08:06.842]  They're through the roof.
[00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:10.464]  I don't even know, I think you're doing as well in Kentucky.
[00:08:10.985 --> 00:08:12.906]  But I know you don't like Obamacare, I know.
[00:08:15.308 --> 00:08:15.749]  Great guy.
[00:08:17.293 --> 00:08:28.207]  We're working to remove regulations on our auto industry so we can make more cars right here in America, including more cars in Kentucky.
[00:08:33.314 --> 00:08:36.775]  We've wiped out many, many unnecessary regulations.
[00:08:37.395 --> 00:08:38.776]  And that's just the beginning.
[00:08:39.376 --> 00:08:42.617]  It's continuing on a weekly basis.
[00:08:42.957 --> 00:08:46.798]  We're getting rid of unnecessary regulations.
[00:08:47.118 --> 00:08:51.999]  We're going to be good for business, and we're going to be good for the workers of America.
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.882]  We've also cleared the way for the Keystone and the Dakota Access Pipeline.
[00:09:07.824 --> 00:09:12.226]  And as I was signing it, I said, where are they getting the steel?
[00:09:12.526 --> 00:09:12.826]  Where?
[00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:14.747]  And I said, you know what?
[00:09:14.807 --> 00:09:25.612]  If people want to build pipelines in the United States, they should use American steel and they should build it and create it right here.
[00:09:25.672 --> 00:09:30.554]  That pipe is going to be manufactured right here.
[00:09:30.574 --> 00:09:33.356]  That was like a last minute.
[00:09:33.376 --> 00:09:36.017]  I'm saying, where are they buying this stuff?
[00:09:37.245 --> 00:09:42.666]  Like Henry Clay, we want to put our own people to work.
[00:09:43.327 --> 00:09:46.087]  We believe in two simple rules.
[00:09:46.648 --> 00:09:50.108]  Buy American and hire American.
[00:09:54.690 --> 00:10:05.573]  So as you folks all know, Henry Clay was a legendary Kentucky politician who became the eighth Speaker of the House in 1811.
[00:10:08.325 --> 00:10:18.011]  You know, they compared my campaign to Jackson, President Jackson, right?
[00:10:18.031 --> 00:10:18.071]  Of 1828.
[00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:21.873]  I said, can you imagine having to go back that far?
[00:10:23.034 --> 00:10:24.955]  And they said this was even more severe.
[00:10:26.416 --> 00:10:27.337]  But we did a good job.
[00:10:27.357 --> 00:10:28.918]  Did we do a great job together?
[00:10:37.493 --> 00:10:39.555]  1828, that's a long time ago.
[00:10:41.737 --> 00:10:42.238]  Oh boy.
[00:10:42.478 --> 00:10:43.940]  And he was a good president, right?
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.381]  He was a good president.
[00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:53.009]  Clay was a fierce advocate for American manufacturing.
[00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:54.551]  He wanted it badly.
[00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:58.315]  He said, very strongly, free trade.
[00:10:59.332 --> 00:11:10.357]  Which would throw wide open our ports to foreign production without duties while theirs remain closed to us.
[00:11:10.397 --> 00:11:11.337]  That was his quote.
[00:11:11.577 --> 00:11:15.459]  He knew all the way back early 1800s.
[00:11:15.999 --> 00:11:18.941]  Clay said that trade must be fair
[00:11:20.237 --> 00:11:22.519]  Equal and reciprocal.
[00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:23.440]  Boom.
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.082]  He said fair, equal and reciprocal.
[00:11:27.463 --> 00:11:29.524]  I'm talking about reciprocal trade.
[00:11:30.545 --> 00:11:31.266]  Reciprocal.
[00:11:34.808 --> 00:11:37.370]  I mentioned that the other day to a group in my office.
[00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:41.133]  We're going to be doing some trade deals soon as we get the health care finished.
[00:11:41.293 --> 00:11:43.835]  Oh, I'm looking forward to these trade deals.
[00:11:44.916 --> 00:11:45.677]  They're the ones.
[00:11:45.897 --> 00:11:49.500]  Oh, there's going to be no ambiguity.
[00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.620]  But I use the word reciprocal.
[00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:56.142]  You know, Harley-Davidson makes great motorcycles.
[00:11:56.563 --> 00:11:57.643]  They were in my office.
[00:11:58.204 --> 00:11:59.244]  They were in my office.
[00:12:00.425 --> 00:12:01.486]  And they came in.
[00:12:02.326 --> 00:12:03.067]  I said, how you doing?
[00:12:03.087 --> 00:12:03.347]  Great.
[00:12:03.727 --> 00:12:04.288]  How's business?
[00:12:04.328 --> 00:12:04.588]  Great.
[00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:06.829]  How do you do overseas?
[00:12:06.869 --> 00:12:07.530]  Well, it's tough.
[00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.092]  We have some countries that charge us a $100 import tax.
[00:12:11.112 --> 00:12:11.933]  I said, a hundred?
[00:12:11.953 --> 00:12:11.973]  A 100%.
[00:12:12.193 --> 00:12:14.154]  Think of it.
[00:12:19.904 --> 00:12:21.504]  They want $100 on that 100%.
[00:12:21.804 --> 00:12:25.885]  So I say, how do you do?
[00:12:25.905 --> 00:12:26.485]  Not so well.
[00:12:26.565 --> 00:12:27.045]  It's tough.
[00:12:27.485 --> 00:12:29.586]  They have other countries that charge a lot.
[00:12:30.486 --> 00:12:31.986]  We want reciprocals.
[00:12:32.026 --> 00:12:35.767]  So if they're going to charge us 100%, we're going to charge them 100%.
[00:12:35.827 --> 00:12:38.307]  And you know what's going to happen?
[00:12:38.327 --> 00:12:42.448]  They're going to bring their 100% down to nothing, like we charge.
[00:12:43.048 --> 00:12:44.528]  We can't allow that to happen.
[00:12:45.588 --> 00:12:48.409]  We can't allow that to happen.
[00:12:50.703 --> 00:12:52.836]  In explaining his American system...
[00:12:53.877 --> 00:13:08.524]  Clay argued that the sole object of the tariff is to tax the produce, and remember, to tax the produce of foreign industry with the view of promoting American industry.
[00:13:08.904 --> 00:13:12.986]  For too long, our government has abandoned the American system.
[00:13:13.506 --> 00:13:22.851]  Since NAFTA was approved in 1994, the worst trade deal ever made by any country, I think, in the world,
[00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:28.854]  America has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs.
[00:13:28.954 --> 00:13:29.875]  Do not worry.
[00:13:30.395 --> 00:13:32.156]  We are starting on NAFTA very soon.
[00:13:32.176 --> 00:13:34.638]  You know, I've only been there for, what, 52 days, right?
[00:13:39.321 --> 00:13:41.642]  Somebody said to me, what are you starting on NAFTA?
[00:13:41.722 --> 00:13:42.523]  I said, wait a minute.
[00:13:42.603 --> 00:13:43.684]  I did this, this, this.
[00:13:44.144 --> 00:13:47.786]  I've knocked out unbelievable numbers of regulations.
[00:13:48.167 --> 00:13:49.928]  We're negotiating much better deals.
[00:13:49.968 --> 00:13:51.309]  These terrible deals that were made.
[00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:54.420]  I've been here like 51 days, give me a chance!
[00:13:55.741 --> 00:13:56.922]  Oh, I look forward.
[00:13:57.022 --> 00:14:01.984]  We're going to do something with NAFTA that you are going to be very, very impressed with.
[00:14:02.204 --> 00:14:03.625]  That's going to be an easy one, folks.
[00:14:03.665 --> 00:14:04.706]  That's going to be an easy one.
[00:14:05.746 --> 00:14:18.353]  Since China joined, and it's another beauty, the World Trade Organization in 2001, the United States has lost many more than 60,000 factories.
[00:14:21.826 --> 00:14:28.230]  We sacrificed our own middle class to finance the growth of foreign countries.
[00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:34.573]  But those days, ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, are over.
[00:14:34.893 --> 00:14:35.674]  Is that okay?
[00:14:39.716 --> 00:14:41.037]  Those days are over!
[00:14:44.559 --> 00:14:45.099]  It's crazy.
[00:14:46.817 --> 00:14:47.497]  You know what that is?
[00:14:47.777 --> 00:14:49.999]  Much more than 60,000 factories.
[00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:50.599]  You know what that is?
[00:14:50.679 --> 00:14:54.761]  It's like, I said, if you have a map, how do you put that many dots in the map, right?
[00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:58.763]  More than 60,000 factories, but they're all coming back.
[00:14:59.483 --> 00:15:00.464]  You see them coming back.
[00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:11.069]  You see car companies that were going to build elsewhere, and now they're saying that because of Trump, we're going to build in Michigan, we're going to build in Ohio, we're going to build in Kentucky.
[00:15:12.429 --> 00:15:13.810]  They're saying it loud and clear.
[00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:19.697]  Because from now on, it's going to be America first.
[00:15:19.978 --> 00:15:20.578]  America first.
[00:15:27.821 --> 00:15:34.023]  We will be, I promise you, a rich nation once again.
[00:15:38.314 --> 00:15:49.477]  And we will do what we have to do, and we will not allow other countries to take advantage of us like they've been doing to a level that's hard to believe.
[00:15:50.097 --> 00:15:50.758]  Hard to believe.
[00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:51.858]  Not gonna happen.
[00:15:52.358 --> 00:15:54.359]  Not gonna happen anymore, Kentucky.
[00:15:54.419 --> 00:15:55.499]  Remember that, okay?
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.221]  You just worry about your basketball team.
[00:16:01.261 --> 00:16:02.321]  I'll take care of the rest.
[00:16:09.246 --> 00:16:14.667]  But to be a rich nation, we must also be a safe nation.
[00:16:15.127 --> 00:16:23.228]  That is why I am following through on my promise to secure, protect, and defend the borders of the United States.
[00:16:37.811 --> 00:16:38.551]  We will build
[00:16:39.696 --> 00:16:40.276]  That's right.
[00:16:41.457 --> 00:16:44.079]  A great, great border wall.
[00:16:51.684 --> 00:16:53.165]  And you know it's already out to bid.
[00:16:53.485 --> 00:16:54.706]  You've probably been reading.
[00:16:55.326 --> 00:16:57.007]  Tremendous numbers of bidders.
[00:16:57.607 --> 00:16:59.469]  What does that mean when you have a lot of bidders?
[00:16:59.549 --> 00:17:02.150]  It means we're going to get it for the right price, okay?
[00:17:02.591 --> 00:17:03.011]  Believe me.
[00:17:04.705 --> 00:17:13.910]  And we will stop the drugs that are pouring into our country and poisoning our youth and plenty of others to stop the drugs.
[00:17:16.432 --> 00:17:18.773]  A lot of them are coming in from the southern border.
[00:17:20.734 --> 00:17:28.959]  Since the day of my election, we've already cut illegal immigration at the southern border by 61%.
[00:17:29.079 --> 00:17:29.699]  Think of that.
[00:17:36.418 --> 00:17:38.240]  61% that we haven't started!
[00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:42.362]  And the courts are not making it easy, folks.
[00:17:43.143 --> 00:17:44.444]  They're not making it easy.
[00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:50.528]  Terrible.
[00:17:51.048 --> 00:17:50.528]  61%.
[00:17:51.769 --> 00:18:04.097]  During the campaign, as I've traveled all across this great country, I met with many American families whose loved ones, sons and daughters, husbands and wives,
[00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:08.052]  We're viciously killed by illegal immigrants.
[00:18:08.833 --> 00:18:09.433]  Incredible.
[00:18:09.453 --> 00:18:10.934]  Incredible.
[00:18:12.194 --> 00:18:22.499]  These amazing American lives were stolen because our government refused to enforce our already existing laws.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.903]  These American victims and their families were ignored by the media.
[00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.764]  The media doesn't want to talk about it.
[00:18:36.707 --> 00:18:38.107]  They don't want to talk about it.
[00:18:40.608 --> 00:18:42.589]  They were ignored by the consultants.
[00:18:42.649 --> 00:18:44.529]  They were ignored by Washington.
[00:18:45.349 --> 00:18:48.690]  But these Americans were not ignored by me.
[00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:51.251]  They were not ignored by you.
[00:18:51.611 --> 00:18:53.492]  You showed that on November 8th.
[00:18:53.832 --> 00:19:00.734]  They were not ignored by you, and they will never be ignored by any of us.
[00:19:05.211 --> 00:19:22.285]  As we speak tonight, we are finding the drug dealers, robbers, thieves, gang members, predators, killers, and criminals of all types preying on our citizens.
[00:19:22.325 --> 00:19:25.427]  You've been seeing it, you've been reading about it, and you've been seeing it.
[00:19:26.308 --> 00:19:26.708]  One by one,
[00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:35.409]  They are being tracked down and thrown the hell out of our country and we will not let them back in.
[00:20:02.361 --> 00:20:08.429]  We are also working to protect our citizens from terrorism.
[00:20:12.233 --> 00:20:15.137]  We have seen the devastation at home from 9-11
[00:20:16.727 --> 00:20:22.911]  To Boston, to San Bernardino, and many, many other places.
[00:20:22.991 --> 00:20:29.055]  We've seen attacks overseas in France, in Germany, in Belgium.
[00:20:29.716 --> 00:20:34.919]  It's time for intelligence and common sense to be used.
[00:20:39.543 --> 00:20:45.447]  The single best way to protect, and you have to do this,
[00:20:46.667 --> 00:20:47.708]  You have to do this.
[00:20:48.848 --> 00:21:01.115]  And to keep foreign terrorists from attacking our country is to keep these foreign terrorists from entering our country in the first place.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.781]  And we will stop
[00:21:12.006 --> 00:21:14.348]  Radical Islamic terrorism.
[00:21:14.388 --> 00:21:15.028]  We will stop it.
[00:21:15.629 --> 00:21:16.549]  Not gonna let it happen.
[00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.530]  Not here.
[00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:18.791]  Not gonna let it happen.
[00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:33.762]  Finally, we want a very big tax cut, but cannot do that until we keep our promise to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.
[00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:45.204]  And we're going to be working very closely with our leader, Mitch McConnell, to get that job done.
[00:21:45.285 --> 00:21:50.466]  Paul, Ryan, everybody, they're going to be working very hard.
[00:21:50.546 --> 00:22:02.931]  And Congressman Andy Barr, Jamie Comer, I have to thank them for their help and their support as we move toward the crucial House vote on Thursday.
[00:22:04.386 --> 00:22:09.553]  The seventh anniversary of Obamacare's very painful passage.
[00:22:10.053 --> 00:22:15.761]  This is our long-awaited chance to finally get rid of Obamacare!
[00:22:15.781 --> 00:22:20.807]  It's a long-awaited chance.
[00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:22.730]  We're gonna do it.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.040]  We're gonna do it.
[00:22:26.661 --> 00:22:27.841]  What's the alternative?
[00:22:27.861 --> 00:22:29.662]  The alternative is what you have.
[00:22:29.982 --> 00:22:31.262]  What you have is nothing.
[00:22:31.982 --> 00:22:32.482]  The worst.
[00:22:32.663 --> 00:22:33.603]  It's the big lie.
[00:22:34.243 --> 00:22:35.103]  And remember this.
[00:22:35.884 --> 00:22:36.464]  So true.
[00:22:37.364 --> 00:22:41.245]  I happen to like, a lot, Senator Rand Paul.
[00:22:41.705 --> 00:22:41.986]  I do.
[00:22:45.607 --> 00:22:45.947]  I do.
[00:22:46.067 --> 00:22:46.547]  I like him.
[00:22:46.567 --> 00:22:47.407]  He's good.
[00:22:48.648 --> 00:22:49.308]  He's a good guy.
[00:22:51.724 --> 00:23:06.169]  And I look forward to working with him so we can get this bill passed, in some form, so that we can pass massive tax reform, which we can't do until this happens.
[00:23:06.829 --> 00:23:09.029]  So we gotta get this done before we can do the other.
[00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:13.251]  In other words, we have to know what this is before we can do the big tax cuts.
[00:23:13.731 --> 00:23:14.711]  We gotta get it done!
[00:23:15.151 --> 00:23:17.072]  For a lot of reasons, but that's one of them.
[00:23:22.828 --> 00:23:29.613]  And it's important to realize how we got to Obamacare in the first place.
[00:23:29.673 --> 00:23:43.082]  Back in 2009 and 2010, House and Senate Democrats forced through a 2,700 page healthcare bill that no one read and no one understood.
[00:23:44.502 --> 00:23:47.765]  By the way, today it's thousands of pages more.
[00:23:48.709 --> 00:23:50.230]  It's not even understandable.
[00:23:50.630 --> 00:24:01.238]  They ignored the public, they ignored the voters, and they jammed a massive, failed healthcare takeover right through Congress.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.281]  And this is what we have.
[00:24:07.322 --> 00:24:15.988]  It's time for Democrat leaders in Washington to take responsibility for the disaster they and they alone created.
[00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:24.372]  Remember when President Obama said, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.
[00:24:24.432 --> 00:24:27.113]  If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.
[00:24:30.114 --> 00:24:31.975]  Nobody brings that stuff up, do they?
[00:24:32.235 --> 00:24:33.195]  Do they ever bring it up?
[00:24:33.635 --> 00:24:34.936]  Matt, I don't think so, right?
[00:24:34.956 --> 00:24:35.736]  They don't bring it up.
[00:24:36.156 --> 00:24:37.717]  Notice how they forget all those things?
[00:24:39.278 --> 00:24:45.340]  Or when the architect of Obamacare said the law was passed because of the stupidity
[00:24:46.517 --> 00:24:47.877]  Of the American voter.
[00:24:48.497 --> 00:24:51.138]  Or Bill Clinton on the campaign trail.
[00:24:52.358 --> 00:24:55.038]  Oh, he must have had a tough night when he went home that night.
[00:24:58.419 --> 00:25:08.461]  Called Obamacare the craziest thing in the world, where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.
[00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:09.441]  Bill Clinton said that.
[00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:11.881]  The craziest thing in the world.
[00:25:12.101 --> 00:25:15.542]  Or the Democratic governor of Minnesota.
[00:25:16.713 --> 00:25:20.494]  Who said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.
[00:25:22.055 --> 00:25:25.676]  It's been one broken promise after another.
[00:25:26.537 --> 00:25:34.379]  People have been kicked off their plans and their premiums have increased by double and triple digits.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.040]  Arizona up 116%.
[00:25:39.301 --> 00:25:43.903]  By the way, insurance companies in a great state
[00:25:44.929 --> 00:25:46.931]  Known as Kentucky, have you ever heard of it?
[00:25:50.474 --> 00:25:55.358]  Are in tremendous trouble, will be fleeing, and we're gonna save it all.
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.681]  We're gonna save it all.
[00:25:58.161 --> 00:25:59.042]  Tremendous trouble.
[00:25:59.062 --> 00:25:59.903]  It's a disaster.
[00:26:04.547 --> 00:26:11.193]  In fact, to counter my speech two weeks ago in Congress, I don't know, did anybody see that speech?
[00:26:14.574 --> 00:26:16.595]  They used the former governor of Kentucky.
[00:26:18.996 --> 00:26:21.417]  And the plan doesn't work in Kentucky.
[00:26:21.437 --> 00:26:22.617]  But Matt will save us.
[00:26:25.018 --> 00:26:32.021]  Many of our best and brightest are leaving the medical profession entirely because of Obamacare.
[00:26:33.118 --> 00:26:43.723]  Obamacare has been a complete and total catastrophe, and it's getting worse and worse by the day, and yet you watch the fake media, the fake news, and they try and build it up.
[00:26:43.803 --> 00:26:45.124]  It's a disaster, fellas.
[00:26:45.744 --> 00:26:46.785]  It's a disaster.
[00:26:54.048 --> 00:26:57.630]  Boy, it'd be great if they told the truth about Obamacare.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:03.423]  It would be so wonderful for the people of this country because it would just sail right through.
[00:27:05.284 --> 00:27:06.965]  Our plan would sail right through.
[00:27:06.986 --> 00:27:14.530]  One-third of the counties in the United States now have only one Obamacare insurer left.
[00:27:14.591 --> 00:27:15.211]  Some have none.
[00:27:16.872 --> 00:27:18.093]  And in your state, it's worse.
[00:27:18.653 --> 00:27:24.097]  In a recent interview, your governor, Matt Bevin, who's right here, so I better be careful,
[00:27:25.487 --> 00:27:29.388]  Said that Obamacare was a disaster in Kentucky.
[00:27:29.448 --> 00:27:29.988]  Is that right?
[00:27:30.008 --> 00:27:32.148]  I'm quoting that so accurately.
[00:27:34.049 --> 00:27:34.509]  And it is!
[00:27:35.589 --> 00:27:37.229]  It's been an absolute disaster.
[00:27:37.289 --> 00:27:41.810]  Half of our counties only have a single provider right now.
[00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:47.171]  It's a financial disaster waiting to happen right here in your own state.
[00:27:47.331 --> 00:27:53.892]  Thursday is our chance to end Obamacare and the Obamacare
[00:27:54.753 --> 00:27:55.674]  Catastrophe.
[00:27:56.134 --> 00:28:00.919]  And begin delivering the reforms our people deserve.
[00:28:04.122 --> 00:28:04.603]  Big thing.
[00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:06.305]  Then we get the tax cuts!
[00:28:08.106 --> 00:28:08.667]  Big thing.
[00:28:09.548 --> 00:28:14.012]  And remember, we're going to negotiate and it's going to go to the Senate and back and forth.
[00:28:14.052 --> 00:28:15.834]  The end result is going to be wonderful.
[00:28:16.355 --> 00:28:18.457]  And it's going to work great.
[00:28:20.368 --> 00:28:31.220]  Once this is done, we are also going to work on bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process.
[00:28:36.045 --> 00:28:38.688]  Some people think that's just as important as healthcare.
[00:28:39.375 --> 00:28:42.337]  The cost of medicine in this country is outrageous.
[00:28:43.078 --> 00:28:48.742]  Many times higher than in some countries in Europe and elsewhere.
[00:28:48.942 --> 00:28:49.302]  Why?
[00:28:49.782 --> 00:28:57.708]  Same pill, same manufacturer, identical, and it's many times higher in the United States.
[00:28:58.328 --> 00:28:58.929]  You know why?
[00:29:00.327 --> 00:29:01.988]  Campaign contributions, who knows?
[00:29:02.608 --> 00:29:04.209]  But somebody's getting very rich.
[00:29:04.489 --> 00:29:05.269]  We're going to bring it down.
[00:29:05.289 --> 00:29:07.570]  We're going to have a great competitive bidding process.
[00:29:07.951 --> 00:29:10.732]  Medicine prices will be coming way down.
[00:29:11.232 --> 00:29:12.793]  Way, way, way down.
[00:29:13.093 --> 00:29:14.634]  And that's going to happen fast.
[00:29:16.975 --> 00:29:18.595]  We're just adding that to the bill.
[00:29:18.695 --> 00:29:20.396]  I said we got to add that to the bill.
[00:29:20.696 --> 00:29:21.877]  We're going to do a bill later.
[00:29:22.617 --> 00:29:24.158]  We're trying to add it to this bill.
[00:29:24.218 --> 00:29:26.239]  And if we can't, we're going to have it right after.
[00:29:27.386 --> 00:29:30.909]  You have some crazy, arcane laws, folks, just in case you haven't heard.
[00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:44.021]  I am confident that if we empower the American people, we will accomplish incredible things for our country, not just on healthcare, but all across our government.
[00:29:44.361 --> 00:29:48.565]  And by the way, that Second Amendment is very, very safe right now.
[00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:55.490]  I promise.
[00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.652]  I said we're going to save the Second Amendment.
[00:29:58.873 --> 00:30:03.496]  I promise you, we are going to save the Second Amendment.
[00:30:03.556 --> 00:30:04.636]  It's very, very safe.
[00:30:04.656 --> 00:30:10.840]  We would not be in good shape if a certain other person won this election.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.521]  I can tell you.
[00:30:13.082 --> 00:30:14.042]  You'd not be happy.
[00:30:17.585 --> 00:30:21.487]  And if they came to make a speech, 250 people would have showed up.
[00:30:24.108 --> 00:30:33.332]  A new spirit of optimism is sweeping across our land and a new national pride is swelling our hearts and stirring our souls.
[00:30:33.412 --> 00:30:33.973]  So true.
[00:30:36.093 --> 00:30:43.857]  Just imagine what we could accomplish if we stand together as a united American people.
[00:30:46.898 --> 00:30:52.581]  Our economy will be unleashed and millions will be lifted from welfare
[00:30:53.897 --> 00:30:54.317]  To work.
[00:30:54.917 --> 00:30:55.418]  Gotta work.
[00:30:55.438 --> 00:30:55.958]  Gotta work.
[00:30:55.978 --> 00:30:58.539]  They're gonna love it.
[00:30:58.559 --> 00:30:59.259]  They're gonna love it!
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.780]  From welfare to work.
[00:31:04.161 --> 00:31:13.804]  Our children will grow up in safe communities, and they will be educated in schools that teach them to love our country and its values.
[00:31:19.113 --> 00:31:24.755]  Our inner cities will find a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.
[00:31:28.496 --> 00:31:33.638]  And you know, your San Francisco quarterback, I'm sure nobody ever heard of him.
[00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.340]  I'm just reporting the news.
[00:31:41.474 --> 00:31:42.895]  There was an article today.
[00:31:42.915 --> 00:31:46.256]  I love to report the news and then they said I made a mistake, right?
[00:31:47.097 --> 00:31:49.978]  I said, no, the people reporting the news made a mistake if it's wrong.
[00:31:51.159 --> 00:32:03.684]  But there was an article today, it was reported, that NFL owners don't want to pick them up because they don't want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump.
[00:32:03.724 --> 00:32:04.425]  Do you believe that?
[00:32:10.348 --> 00:32:10.928]  I just saw that.
[00:32:11.849 --> 00:32:12.670]  I just saw that.
[00:32:15.092 --> 00:32:18.796]  I said, if I remember that one, I'm going to report it to the people of Kentucky.
[00:32:19.656 --> 00:32:24.461]  Because they like it when people actually stand for the American flag, right?
[00:32:33.258 --> 00:32:42.766]  Our struggling industries are going to be revitalized, and our dying factories will come roaring back to life.
[00:32:42.826 --> 00:32:43.787]  It's already happening.
[00:32:48.211 --> 00:32:55.137]  And in our dealings with other nations, we will find a new era of security, cooperation, and peace.
[00:32:55.857 --> 00:33:01.202]  And we won't be played for the fool, and we won't be played for the suckers any longer.
[00:33:04.795 --> 00:33:12.556]  This is the future that awaits us if we embrace our destiny as Americans, which we did.
[00:33:13.577 --> 00:33:18.677]  This was one of the greatest things, one of the biggest events ever to happen in our country.
[00:33:19.478 --> 00:33:23.578]  And we're going to make it even better than anybody ever thought possible.
[00:33:23.878 --> 00:33:25.619]  That's happening already.
[00:33:28.919 --> 00:33:33.420]  We are one people, and we share one fate.
[00:33:34.821 --> 00:33:43.723]  Whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood.
[00:33:47.584 --> 00:33:53.606]  We all salute the same great American flag.
[00:33:58.407 --> 00:34:02.768]  And we are all made by the same Almighty God.
[00:34:11.878 --> 00:34:17.222]  As long as we remember these truths, we will not fail.
[00:34:17.542 --> 00:34:19.683]  Nobody, nobody can beat us.
[00:34:19.964 --> 00:34:20.504]  Nobody.
[00:34:23.906 --> 00:34:27.329]  We are Americans and the future belongs to us.
[00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:30.371]  The future belongs to you.
[00:34:31.091 --> 00:34:32.492]  This is your moment.
[00:34:32.872 --> 00:34:34.153]  This is your time.
[00:34:34.734 --> 00:34:40.718]  And this, the United States of America, is your country again.
[00:35:06.696 --> 00:35:16.365]  So with hope in our souls and patriotism in our hearts, let us now recite these words.
[00:35:17.386 --> 00:35:18.006]  Are you ready?
[00:35:20.468 --> 00:35:24.712]  Together, we will make America strong again.
[00:35:26.954 --> 00:35:29.737]  We will make America wealthy again.
[00:35:31.238 --> 00:35:33.440]  We will make America proud again.
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.164]  We will make America safe again.
[00:35:40.969 --> 00:35:46.176]  And we will make America great again.
[00:35:46.817 --> 00:35:47.458]  Thank you.
[00:35:47.618 --> 00:35:48.700]  Thank you, Kentucky.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.521]  God bless you.
[00:35:49.982 --> 00:35:50.362]  Thank you.

[00:37:40.789 --> 00:37:44.854]  A behind-the-scenes inside story of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.
[00:37:45.055 --> 00:37:46.596]  It's never been published anywhere else.
[00:37:46.737 --> 00:37:48.719]  This is the guy who will know, of course.
[00:37:48.739 --> 00:37:52.544]  Trump advisor, comfort on every step along the way, Roger Stone.
[00:37:52.624 --> 00:37:59.212]  The making of the president details the account of Roger Stone and many other Trump insiders who have been longtime friends and advisors to Trump since the 1980s.
[00:38:00.333 --> 00:38:06.477]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[00:38:06.537 --> 00:38:07.938]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[00:38:30.753 --> 00:38:32.694]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[00:38:33.314 --> 00:38:38.975]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[00:38:39.575 --> 00:38:47.717]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[00:38:47.737 --> 00:38:50.237]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[00:38:50.537 --> 00:38:54.838]  This is the best system out there, and we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[00:38:55.098 --> 00:38:55.858]  This is how it works.
[00:38:56.159 --> 00:38:56.699]  You order.
[00:38:56.819 --> 00:38:57.639]  Customize or

[00:39:00.745 --> 00:39:03.967]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[00:39:04.288 --> 00:39:08.411]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[00:39:08.631 --> 00:39:09.412]  You cannot lose.
[00:39:09.452 --> 00:39:10.573]  You're funding the Infowar.
[00:39:10.893 --> 00:39:17.779]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[00:39:18.119 --> 00:39:22.123]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[00:39:38.078 --> 00:39:40.901]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, the nightly news tonight.
[00:39:40.941 --> 00:39:44.744]  We're live this Monday, March 20th, 2017.
[00:39:44.804 --> 00:39:48.408]  Of course, you've just heard Donald Trump with his address in Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:39:48.988 --> 00:39:55.975]  We're going to be going to Leanne McAdoo and Owen Schroer in a little bit for their analysis, but before we do, I just want to cover some of the news today.
[00:39:55.995 --> 00:39:59.819]  Of course, Donald Trump didn't have anything to say in the speech really about
[00:40:00.478 --> 00:40:04.600]  The meetings on Capitol Hill today with FBI Director Comey.
[00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:09.984]  But the Comey Show was being live-tweeted by Donald Trump as it was happening.
[00:40:10.004 --> 00:40:13.226]  We're going to give you his comments earlier today that he put out on Twitter.
[00:40:13.886 --> 00:40:18.509]  Before we do, I just want to take a look at this news article that just came out from McClatchy.
[00:40:18.549 --> 00:40:23.792]  And in this, they point out that this red herring, and really, that is what we're talking about here.
[00:40:23.812 --> 00:40:28.755]  You know, the metaphor, the red herring, was back in the days when they were trying to stop fox hunting in England.
[00:40:29.395 --> 00:40:40.560]  As the fox would go by, the people who were anti-hunters would take a smelly fish, a red herring, and they would drag it across the trail to try to get the foxhounds to lose their scent.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:44.041]  And that's precisely what the Russians hacked our election is.
[00:40:44.121 --> 00:40:45.162]  It's a red herring.
[00:40:45.742 --> 00:40:46.622]  And Donald Trump took that on.
[00:40:46.642 --> 00:40:49.104]  But of course, they're taking this much farther now.
[00:40:49.184 --> 00:40:50.484]  They're now moving this out.
[00:40:50.504 --> 00:40:53.645]  They said they're going to take a look at the far-right news sites.
[00:40:53.685 --> 00:40:54.306]  Yes, that's right.
[00:40:55.046 --> 00:41:04.036]  We are part of the Russian conspiracy, and of course they're coming after Roger Stone, but they specifically came after Breitbart News and InfoWars News.
[00:41:04.537 --> 00:41:05.698]  This was McClatchy Today.
[00:41:05.738 --> 00:41:11.544]  They said operatives for Russia appear to have strategically timed the computer commands known as bots.
[00:41:12.205 --> 00:41:19.970]  To blitz social media with links to pro-Trump stories at times when the billionaire businessman was on the defensive in his race against Democrat Hillary Clinton, these sources said.
[00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.671]  In other words, we didn't build this.
[00:41:21.751 --> 00:41:23.852]  This is the Obama version.
[00:41:23.892 --> 00:41:25.173]  You know, you did not build this.
[00:41:25.313 --> 00:41:26.433]  Bots built it.
[00:41:26.453 --> 00:41:27.354]  Or the government built it.
[00:41:27.434 --> 00:41:28.475]  Or the Russians built it.
[00:41:29.275 --> 00:41:39.000]  They don't want to talk about Apple News or Google or Facebook or any of these other mainstream media or social media efforts to hijack the narrative, to censor other points of views.
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:39.920]  No, they don't want to talk about that.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:45.243]  They want to pretend that we did not exist if it wasn't for some secretive Russian operation.
[00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:56.088]  They said the bots and products were largely millions of Twitter and Facebook posts carrying links to stories on conservative internet sites such as Breitbart News and InfoWars as well as on Kremlin-backed
[00:41:56.718 --> 00:41:57.399]  RT News.
[00:41:57.439 --> 00:41:57.939]  There you go.
[00:41:58.259 --> 00:41:59.400]  Kremlin-backed RT News.
[00:42:00.261 --> 00:42:05.605]  They said some of the stories were false or mixed fact and fiction, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
[00:42:05.825 --> 00:42:07.287]  They don't want to put their name out there.
[00:42:07.847 --> 00:42:12.531]  These are just anonymous charges put out there, saying that, well, these are fact or fiction.
[00:42:12.551 --> 00:42:13.332]  We don't really know.
[00:42:13.412 --> 00:42:15.173]  It's maybe a mixture of fact and fiction.
[00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:17.275]  They don't want to be specific about anything.
[00:42:17.375 --> 00:42:18.055]  They want to
[00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:23.442]  Talk about a specific story and attack its credibility or the specifics of this.
[00:42:23.582 --> 00:42:23.942]  No, no.
[00:42:24.022 --> 00:42:31.932]  They just want to come out with broad-brushed attacks against Infowars and people who actually did get the information out there.
[00:42:32.493 --> 00:42:33.674]  And of course, what we've been telling you
[00:42:34.716 --> 00:42:34.876]  I don't
[00:42:55.442 --> 00:43:03.548]  Use the Internet of Things, use your appliances to spy on you, to eavesdrop on you, and when Donald Trump says that, they want to pretend that he's totally out of his mind.
[00:43:03.748 --> 00:43:06.550]  I think it's very interesting today when we look at this.
[00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:10.013]  We heard a lot of talk on the congressional hearings today.
[00:43:10.033 --> 00:43:14.556]  A lot of people saying, well, you know, it's okay for us to listen to Russian citizens.
[00:43:14.596 --> 00:43:19.359]  They don't have, non-American citizens don't have any Bill of Rights protection.
[00:43:19.419 --> 00:43:20.760]  They don't have any Fourth Amendment protection.
[00:43:21.221 --> 00:43:22.642]  So understand, they don't have
[00:43:23.382 --> 00:43:25.125]  The protections that American citizens do.
[00:43:25.485 --> 00:43:26.206]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:43:26.827 --> 00:43:29.111]  And yet, we look to the immigration system.
[00:43:29.792 --> 00:43:37.243]  They're saying that not only do they have a right to immigrate, they're saying that they have a right to be first in line at the welfare state.
[00:43:38.052 --> 00:43:45.197]  Pushing in a head of veterans who have a legitimate claim because of a contract, essentially, made with them by the American government.
[00:43:45.217 --> 00:43:46.878]  You serve in the military, we'll take care of you.
[00:43:46.938 --> 00:43:53.762]  No, they push the illegal immigrants here, the foreign citizens, who they say don't have any rights and they can spy on them at will.
[00:43:54.023 --> 00:43:58.646]  But those foreign citizens can come into this country and they can get at the front of the line.
[00:43:59.346 --> 00:44:00.286]  Over military veterans.
[00:44:00.787 --> 00:44:01.527]  Over our children.
[00:44:02.127 --> 00:44:08.069]  Over the American dream and have you pay for their education when their country refuses to pay for it.
[00:44:08.249 --> 00:44:14.091]  Mexico sends these people in and helps them to violate our laws to criminally trespass in our country.
[00:44:14.411 --> 00:44:20.253]  Helps their foreign citizens to criminally trespass and get education here at our expense in the language of their choice.
[00:44:20.933 --> 00:44:23.534]  Because your American dream of a home doesn't matter.
[00:44:23.654 --> 00:44:27.996]  It's only their dream of getting a free education paid for by citizens of another country.
[00:44:28.598 --> 00:44:35.182]  Along those lines today, we see that ICE has released a list of sanctuary cities that are set to lose federal funding.
[00:44:35.582 --> 00:44:41.585]  They say that there are 118 sanctuary cities that Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified today.
[00:44:42.005 --> 00:44:44.286]  They're going to start to lose their federal funds.
[00:44:44.326 --> 00:44:48.869]  And in this story from Daily Caller, they point out that these jurisdictions include Philadelphia.
[00:44:48.889 --> 00:44:54.752]  And remember, we just had the story over the weekend that Philadelphia has canceled their Cinco de Mayo parade.
[00:44:54.932 --> 00:44:56.033]  They're fearing that
[00:44:56.633 --> 00:44:59.494]  The people who are attending it are going to get arrested by ICE.
[00:44:59.514 --> 00:45:00.554]  So that's an omission.
[00:45:00.574 --> 00:45:08.597]  Most of the people that are going to be at the Cinco de Mayo parade are illegal immigrants, foreign citizens who are criminally trespassing here in America.
[00:45:08.617 --> 00:45:12.358]  So let's just cancel the parade so that they don't find these citizens.
[00:45:12.758 --> 00:45:22.361]  Also, Clark County, Nevada, where Las Vegas is, Washington D.C., Boston, Newark, New York City, Chicago, Milwaukee, all of Rhode Island's state prisons, and of course,
[00:45:23.479 --> 00:45:27.902]  One jurisdiction that deserves special mention is right here in Travis County.
[00:45:28.443 --> 00:45:40.271]  They said there were 206 detainers issued by ICE that jurisdictions, these sanctuary cities, declined to enforce in just one week, January 28th through February the 3rd.
[00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:44.734]  They said a significant portion of these detainers were ignored by Travis County, Texas.
[00:45:45.214 --> 00:45:51.939]  In the period of one week, Travis County refused to honor detainers for 12 immigrants from Central America charged with
[00:45:52.899 --> 00:45:54.600]  Let me repeat that.
[00:45:56.001 --> 00:46:10.350]  12 illegal immigrants who have immunity, according to Sheriff Hernandez and her sanctuary ideas, they have immunity against sexual assault because they're foreign citizens who are criminally trespassing in our country.
[00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:12.171]  They get special protection.
[00:46:13.351 --> 00:46:15.212]  Even though they've committed sexual assault.
[00:46:15.653 --> 00:46:23.859]  Travis County's Sheriff, they say, has vowed to not cooperate with ICE and of course there is a war going on between her and Texas' Governor Abbott.
[00:46:25.222 --> 00:46:35.725]  In a related story, Reuters reports that almost half of Canadians want the illegal border crossers who are now coming from America into Canada, they want them deported.
[00:46:35.845 --> 00:46:46.189]  They said nearly half of Canadians want to deport people who are illegally crossing into Canada from the United States and a similar number disapprove of how Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is handling the influx.
[00:46:46.249 --> 00:46:52.991]  A significant minority, four out of ten respondents said the border crossers could make Canada less safe.
[00:46:53.091 --> 00:46:53.511]  You think so?
[00:46:54.304 --> 00:46:54.764]  I think so.
[00:46:55.424 --> 00:47:01.586]  There's been broad bipartisan support, they say, for high levels of legal immigration in Canada for decades.
[00:47:02.306 --> 00:47:05.546]  Trudeau is now under pressure over the flow of illegal immigrants.
[00:47:05.566 --> 00:47:06.907]  You understand there's a difference.
[00:47:07.087 --> 00:47:09.267]  There's a difference between legal and illegal.
[00:47:09.307 --> 00:47:17.189]  And of course, over the weekend, we had a report about MS-13 gangs, who are on the rise just outside of Washington, D.C.
[00:47:17.249 --> 00:47:17.709]  and Maryland.
[00:47:17.729 --> 00:47:19.689]  Of course, they started in Los Angeles.
[00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:20.170]  MS-13 itself
[00:47:22.253 --> 00:47:23.714]  is a product of illegal immigration.
[00:47:24.374 --> 00:47:28.776]  We had a massive influx of immigrants from El Salvador who went into L.A.
[00:47:29.476 --> 00:47:32.978]  They felt that they were being put upon by other gang members.
[00:47:33.178 --> 00:47:37.920]  So they started organizing and they organized back into El Salvador with cooperation.
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:42.642]  So it's a multinational gang that continues to operate that fortified its position there.
[00:47:42.842 --> 00:47:43.763]  And it's not really clear.
[00:47:43.803 --> 00:47:45.163]  That was an article that was very
[00:47:46.684 --> 00:47:47.645]  Pro-immigration.
[00:47:47.805 --> 00:47:50.727]  I doubt that these people were necessarily defending themselves.
[00:47:50.927 --> 00:47:57.912]  Regardless of whether that was the case or not, it would not have happened if we didn't have unlimited, uncontrolled immigration into our country.
[00:47:58.512 --> 00:48:00.193]  That we have absolutely no say-so about it.
[00:48:00.273 --> 00:48:01.354]  Now that they've gotten a foothold.
[00:48:01.834 --> 00:48:02.335]  They're there.
[00:48:02.695 --> 00:48:03.595]  They're on Long Island.
[00:48:03.956 --> 00:48:05.377]  They're in Washington, D.C.
[00:48:05.777 --> 00:48:16.064]  We have them in all these different jurisdictions committing murder, committing crimes, and of course, setting up a structure of organized crime very similar to what we've seen with the Mafia, for example, in the past.
[00:48:16.744 --> 00:48:19.446]  That is the product of illegal immigration.
[00:48:19.966 --> 00:48:28.612]  They say this poll which was conducted between March 8th and 9th in Canada said that 48% supported increasing the deportation of people living in Canada illegally.
[00:48:29.272 --> 00:48:29.512]  So it's 48%
[00:48:31.206 --> 00:48:31.526]  That's right.
[00:48:51.954 --> 00:48:58.816]  We've gotten a little bit of a breather room now because the actual spending, the debt, has gone down a little bit under Donald Trump.
[00:48:59.316 --> 00:49:00.816]  I don't think that's going to remain.
[00:49:00.856 --> 00:49:02.497]  I think it's going to continue to grow.
[00:49:02.517 --> 00:49:04.958]  There's other issues that are going to be brought into this.
[00:49:04.998 --> 00:49:07.458]  So the question is, how will this play out?
[00:49:07.738 --> 00:49:12.760]  I think they'll ultimately all agree, we've seen this happen over and over again, they're going to increase the debt ceiling.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:20.282]  But in the meantime, what they're going to do is they're going to use this as a means to stall or to block
[00:49:21.002 --> 00:49:30.671]  Any kind of Obamacare repeal or tax reform or other kinds of reform, they're going to use this as additional leverage against Donald Trump to try to block reform.
[00:49:31.492 --> 00:49:46.825]  Also in another story today on Infowars.com, on Saturday, the man who was involved in the White House bomb scare, the man they picked up who pulled up with a stolen car and had a bomb in it, he said, he said, this is a test.
[00:49:47.628 --> 00:49:53.868]  And he did that and said that as he was being arrested and as they got him out of his stolen 2017 Chevrolet Impala.
[00:49:53.888 --> 00:49:54.209]  You know what?
[00:49:55.165 --> 00:49:56.346]  This is all a test.
[00:49:56.946 --> 00:50:02.570]  And we're facing a test right now with this situation that Comey did on Capitol Hill.
[00:50:03.011 --> 00:50:06.593]  It truly is a test of the will and the resolve of the American people.
[00:50:06.673 --> 00:50:10.116]  Will they understand what is truly at stake here?
[00:50:10.876 --> 00:50:14.039]  You know, WikiLeaks, when they talked about this today, they were tweeting this out.
[00:50:14.059 --> 00:50:14.839]  They said, you know, U.S.
[00:50:14.899 --> 00:50:21.544]  agencies have interfered with 81 elections, not including coups done by the CIA.
[00:50:23.092 --> 00:50:24.953]  And they put a list out with it.
[00:50:25.193 --> 00:50:27.875]  This was research that was done by Carnegie Mellon Research.
[00:50:28.755 --> 00:50:37.420]  And you have to understand that what is happening right now, when we look at what Comey did on Capitol Hill today, where he comes out and he says, wiretaps against Donald Trump?
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.901]  Absolutely no way.
[00:50:39.161 --> 00:50:40.121]  No way there's wiretaps.
[00:50:40.602 --> 00:50:41.122]  A Russia hack?
[00:50:41.302 --> 00:50:42.443]  Well, of course that happened.
[00:50:43.303 --> 00:50:43.803]  You understand?
[00:50:43.943 --> 00:50:49.386]  When you look at those two things, you have to understand that this is not just a double standard.
[00:50:50.147 --> 00:50:52.048]  This is an attempt at a coup.
[00:50:53.211 --> 00:51:11.344]  Of course, we had James Mason warn us that if we get involved in foreign countries, if we create an American empire, that even if it's not an American empire, even if we use means of defense abroad, we have to guard against those tools coming back home and being used as instruments of tyranny.
[00:51:11.884 --> 00:51:13.625]  This is what the dark state is about.
[00:51:14.086 --> 00:51:16.888]  You know, we look at this situation, the questions that came out today.
[00:51:16.908 --> 00:51:22.352]  They ask him, are you investigating the leaks about Michael Flynn, General Michael Flynn?
[00:51:23.052 --> 00:51:24.713]  We know that's a crime.
[00:51:25.674 --> 00:51:27.415]  But of course, the FBI director said, I can't say.
[00:51:27.895 --> 00:51:28.255]  Can't say.
[00:51:28.295 --> 00:51:33.839]  Can't talk about whether or not we're investigating the people who leaked information about Flynn.
[00:51:34.439 --> 00:51:35.940]  Are you investigating the Clinton Foundation?
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.301]  Can't say anything about that either.
[00:51:38.321 --> 00:51:40.863]  No, that's not anything I can comment.
[00:51:41.636 --> 00:51:48.221]  Well, are you investigating the rash of intelligence leaks surrounding Donald Trump that have been put out to discredit him?
[00:51:48.241 --> 00:51:51.564]  And of course, violating secrets just like with Michael Flynn.
[00:51:51.584 --> 00:51:53.145]  No, can't comment on that.
[00:51:53.785 --> 00:51:54.306]  Not doing any of that.
[00:51:54.446 --> 00:51:58.669]  But we are investigating the Russian link to Donald Trump.
[00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:02.392]  And we are looking to see if they colluded to hack the election.
[00:52:02.412 --> 00:52:03.673]  Now, as part of that questioning,
[00:52:04.738 --> 00:52:16.606]  We had Nunes specifically ask Comey, as well as Rogers, state by state, did you see anybody adjust any election totals in this state, in this state, in this state, in this state?
[00:52:16.666 --> 00:52:18.588]  And every one of them they said, no, no, no, no.
[00:52:19.448 --> 00:52:26.053]  Now what he did not do at the end was to say, well then we can't really say what the Democrats are implying, right?
[00:52:26.073 --> 00:52:32.658]  The Democrats are implying when they say hacked, they're implying that somebody went in and flipped the votes in these states, aren't they?
[00:52:33.769 --> 00:52:35.170]  That's why they're using that word.
[00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:36.771]  But then they come back and say, oh, no, no, no.
[00:52:36.852 --> 00:52:40.755]  We're just saying they're manipulating public opinion, like the first story that I read to you.
[00:52:41.015 --> 00:52:48.421]  Oh, they're manipulating public opinion by somehow getting their information out through Breitbart and through Infowars and people who are not the mainstream media.
[00:52:48.481 --> 00:52:50.603]  Yes, we will cover things like Vault 7.
[00:52:51.543 --> 00:52:55.206]  We told you about it before it was exposed, and now we say, see, we told you so.
[00:52:55.286 --> 00:52:59.490]  And here are the documents, just like when Ed Snowden's information came out.
[00:53:00.356 --> 00:53:06.441]  Now, as part of this hearing, Comey had a lot of things that he said that were very interesting.
[00:53:06.481 --> 00:53:12.085]  He said there was no information to support Trump's tweets, that he was being wiretapped.
[00:53:12.105 --> 00:53:17.849]  Of course, we just have to pretend that the NSA and the CIA do not do that sort of thing.
[00:53:17.969 --> 00:53:19.330]  They would never do that sort of thing.
[00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:24.814]  As a matter of fact, he actually said no president could order such surveillance.
[00:53:25.805 --> 00:53:32.411]  Isn't that the discussion that we've had for the last three or four years since we had the Snowden documents come out?
[00:53:32.791 --> 00:53:35.294]  We've all talked about, how in the world could they do such a thing?
[00:53:35.794 --> 00:53:37.415]  That's against the law, it's against the Fourth Amendment.
[00:53:38.116 --> 00:53:41.619]  And so we've had this discussion, but now he comes out and he says, well, no president could do that.
[00:53:41.699 --> 00:53:43.701]  What he meant was, no president could legally do that.
[00:53:43.721 --> 00:53:45.863]  You see how he's playing with the words here?
[00:53:46.504 --> 00:53:49.787]  Not saying that no president could legally do that, just no president could do that.
[00:53:50.643 --> 00:53:56.029]  Well, you know, we never had any search warrants, did we, for Nixon's Watergate plumbers.
[00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.371]  Didn't have them.
[00:53:57.891 --> 00:53:59.273]  We had a cover-up, though, too, didn't we?
[00:53:59.894 --> 00:54:06.221]  And we also had the FBI and the Washington Post at the center of that coup, didn't we?
[00:54:07.823 --> 00:54:11.427]  Deep Throat was the deputy director of the FBI.
[00:54:12.924 --> 00:54:14.746]  I did not like Richard Nixon.
[00:54:14.886 --> 00:54:16.067]  I thought he should have been impeached.
[00:54:16.127 --> 00:54:18.128]  I thought he should have been impeached for creating the EPA.
[00:54:18.188 --> 00:54:21.591]  I thought he should have been impeached for a lot of things that he did.
[00:54:21.611 --> 00:54:23.072]  He had wage and price controls.
[00:54:23.112 --> 00:54:25.094]  He had 55 mile an hour speed limits.
[00:54:25.394 --> 00:54:27.015]  None of those are constitutional issues.
[00:54:27.916 --> 00:54:34.221]  He created the war on drugs, which was nothing but a UN agenda that he rubber-stamped after 10 years.
[00:54:34.501 --> 00:54:36.883]  For all those things, Richard Nixon should have been impeached.
[00:54:36.923 --> 00:54:37.744]  I thought he was a crook.
[00:54:38.184 --> 00:54:39.666]  I celebrated when he was impeached.
[00:54:39.726 --> 00:54:42.168]  And then, as time went on, I realized, wait a minute.
[00:54:42.892 --> 00:54:43.572]  This is a coup.
[00:54:44.693 --> 00:54:48.674]  And we shouldn't celebrate a coup, even if we don't like the person it's directed against.
[00:54:48.994 --> 00:54:57.957]  And I'm talking to the Democrats here, because if you celebrate the means of why they're trying to destroy the Trump administration here, you have to be very careful.
[00:54:58.557 --> 00:55:02.539]  Because we're getting closer and closer and closer to a banana republic.
[00:55:03.099 --> 00:55:09.121]  Some of the other things that Comey said was, again, he confirmed that he's probing the Russian red herring.
[00:55:10.134 --> 00:55:13.900]  And he also said that there's no information to support these tweets.
[00:55:13.921 --> 00:55:15.663]  And then, as CNN reports this...
[00:55:16.325 --> 00:55:17.646]  Listen to the way they spin this.
[00:55:17.666 --> 00:55:20.808]  Trump's wiretapping accusations come to a head at the Comey hearing.
[00:55:20.848 --> 00:55:27.353]  They say, the bizarre saga of President Trump's claims that he was wiretapped by President Obama.
[00:55:27.893 --> 00:55:28.574]  Isn't that bizarre?
[00:55:28.614 --> 00:55:29.775]  It's a bizarre saga.
[00:55:30.115 --> 00:55:30.695]  It's paranoid.
[00:55:31.336 --> 00:55:32.497]  It's totally schizophrenic.
[00:55:33.057 --> 00:55:37.160]  It's beyond belief that he would come up with some ridiculous conspiracy theory like this.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:41.543]  They call it a moment of political theater that could end in humiliation for Trump.
[00:55:42.344 --> 00:55:44.946]  Well, you know, that's the point, isn't it?
[00:55:45.779 --> 00:55:48.282]  They're trying to end Trump by humiliating him.
[00:55:48.742 --> 00:55:50.924]  That's one of the things that Chuck Schumer said today.
[00:55:51.225 --> 00:55:53.607]  But I want to read to you from WikiLeaks here what they talked about.
[00:55:54.148 --> 00:55:56.029]  Remember we said there's been 81 countries.
[00:55:58.007 --> 00:55:58.267]  I don't know.
[00:56:22.116 --> 00:56:31.343]  With the upcoming French elections, but the EU officials telling us the Russians are going to be trying to hack their elections.
[00:56:32.144 --> 00:56:34.386]  And yet we know that it was the CIA that was doing it.
[00:56:34.886 --> 00:56:38.669]  They got Holland, they got Sarkozy, and they got Le Pen.
[00:56:38.709 --> 00:56:42.172]  They got all of these people and the political parties, every major political party.
[00:56:42.933 --> 00:56:49.418]  Meanwhile, as I said before, Comey will not commit to investigating the known crime of Flynn's leaks.
[00:56:49.638 --> 00:56:51.179]  He says, I don't want to confirm
[00:56:52.059 --> 00:56:52.219]  I think?
[00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:31.338]  He says they released a report tying Russian hacking, this is the DNC who released the report, to an incident that never happened yet, even after the report had been debunked.
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:40.828]  FBI Director James Comey will still refer to CrowdSource as, quote, a highly respected private company at the Senate hearing today.
[00:57:40.848 --> 00:57:55.340]  It says, by issuing a still unrestricted report about an incident that never happened, then tying it to the alleged Russian hacks that Democrats claim tipped the election for President Trump, the DNC-employed CrowdStrike's credibility deserves to be called into question.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:59.924]  However, despite excellent reporting by cybersecurity expert Jeffrey Carr at Bloomberg,
[00:58:00.564 --> 00:58:16.613]  Leonid Vershidsky and Voice of America reporter Kuzmenko, the media has ignored the story and continued to cite CrowdStrike's work even after the Ukrainian Defense Ministry issued a statement on January 6th refuting their claims.
[00:58:16.673 --> 00:58:27.640]  And he said, even more troubling than the media malfeasance is the fact that Director Comey admitted that the FBI had been denied access to the DNC servers and praised CrowdStrike
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:34.142]  Without mentioning that they worked for the DNC, or that their recent report had been debunked.
[00:58:35.442 --> 00:58:43.525]  You see, James Comey and other people have pointed this out, is really, in many ways, worse than Jagger Hoover.
[00:58:44.963 --> 00:58:51.586]  As someone pointed out, J. Edgar Hoover never had a situation where he attacked both candidates for the presidency.
[00:58:51.666 --> 00:59:03.690]  He's putting himself, he's a very political FBI director, and he's putting himself in a position of power that we did not even see with the notorious rule of J. Edgar Hoover.
[00:59:05.171 --> 00:59:07.952]  Now, in other news, we've got to tell you that this is
[00:59:09.102 --> 00:59:09.602]  A coup.
[00:59:10.183 --> 00:59:11.323]  I'm not the only one saying this.
[00:59:11.503 --> 00:59:13.044]  A lot of people are starting to understand this.
[00:59:13.124 --> 00:59:18.947]  Breitbart pointed out that Rush Limbaugh today in talking about the Comey hearings said that this is a message to Trump.
[00:59:19.747 --> 00:59:24.289]  You stop the drain the swamp stuff or you're going to face impeachment.
[00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:28.771]  And again Donald Trump pointed this out when he talked about the wiretaps.
[00:59:28.791 --> 00:59:30.232]  He said this is Nixonian.
[00:59:30.272 --> 00:59:31.853]  This is like Watergate.
[00:59:32.602 --> 00:59:40.327]  Today, Rush Limbaugh said this was meant to be a warning shot at Trump to allow the Washington Republicans to run the town or to face possible impeachment.
[00:59:40.527 --> 00:59:49.954]  He said the Never Trumpers on both sides of the aisle, there's conservative Never Trumpers today who are celebrating over the fact that communicated official that there is an investigation of Trump.
[00:59:50.905 --> 00:59:52.607]  To see if he's colluding with the Russians.
[00:59:52.767 --> 00:59:58.332]  On the Democrat side, we've got Chuckie Schumer saying Trump must apologize for the wiretapping claim.
[00:59:58.912 --> 01:00:02.075]  Remember, this is about damaging his credibility.
[01:00:02.095 --> 01:00:04.117]  And Schumer said as much today.
[01:00:04.137 --> 01:00:10.343]  He said President Trump owes the American people and President Obama more than just an explanation, but an apology.
[01:00:10.844 --> 01:00:16.249]  Did he ever demand that President Obama apologize to the American people for the NSA surveillance?
[01:00:17.555 --> 01:00:20.596]  Or Project Dragnet for any of the things that he did.
[01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:33.038]  Did he ever demand that President Trump apologize to the American public for jailing more whistleblowers and journalists under the 1917 Espionage Act than all the other presidents in that 100 years combined?
[01:00:33.578 --> 01:00:33.738]  No.
[01:00:34.479 --> 01:00:38.159]  He never demanded that President Obama apologize for any of that.
[01:00:38.819 --> 01:00:44.881]  But he says that President Trump should admit that he was wrong, stop the outlandish tweets, and get to work on behalf of this country.
[01:00:44.901 --> 01:00:46.301]  Well, that's precisely what he's trying to do.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.522]  But they are trying to stop that with this red herring attack.
[01:00:50.562 --> 01:00:53.504]  He said, unproven theories from the fringes, or what we're saying.
[01:00:53.844 --> 01:00:57.707]  President Trump has severely damaged his credibility, which is essential to being president.
[01:00:58.547 --> 01:00:59.848]  Well, Chuck Schumer got that right.
[01:01:00.569 --> 01:01:06.493]  It is essential to have credibility in order to be president, and that's what these attacks are designed to destroy.
[01:01:07.293 --> 01:01:12.336]  First assassinate him, his character, by assassinating his credibility, then assassinate him.
[01:01:12.797 --> 01:01:16.019]  As a matter of fact, Glenn Greenwald, not a fan of Donald Trump.
[01:01:16.721 --> 01:01:29.134]  Not someone who believed anything negative about Barack Obama, but now he is pointing out that key Democrat officials are warning their base not to expect evidence of a Trump-Russia collusion.
[01:01:29.274 --> 01:01:32.997]  This is a story that came out March 16th, last Thursday.
[01:01:33.738 --> 01:01:34.559]  Listen to what he had to say.
[01:01:34.579 --> 01:01:45.825]  The principal problem for Democrats is that so many media figures and online charlatans are personally benefiting from feeding their base increasingly unhinged, fact-free conspiracies.
[01:01:46.365 --> 01:01:47.746]  This is Glenn Greenwald.
[01:01:47.766 --> 01:01:49.747]  He is not a Trump fan whatsoever.
[01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:55.170]  But he's calling these Russian red herring stories fact-free conspiracies.
[01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:56.631]  He's calling them unhinged, and they are.
[01:01:56.651 --> 01:02:01.614]  And he says just as right-wing media polemicists did that after both Bill Clinton and Obama were elected.
[01:02:02.321 --> 01:02:09.544]  He says there are now millions of partisan soldiers who are absolutely convinced of a Trump-Russia conspiracy for which, at least as of now, there is no evidence.
[01:02:09.584 --> 01:02:12.065]  But they just can't wait for Donald Trump to be impeached.
[01:02:12.405 --> 01:02:14.566]  And then he takes on the left media.
[01:02:14.586 --> 01:02:18.868]  He shows Rachel Maddow saying Russians may be controlling our government.
[01:02:18.908 --> 01:02:24.130]  He said key Democrat officials are clearly worried about the expectations that have been purposely stoked
[01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:26.891]  And they're now trying to tamp them down.
[01:02:26.951 --> 01:02:27.892]  This is very interesting.
[01:02:28.232 --> 01:02:32.675]  He points out former CIA acting chief Michael Morell.
[01:02:32.835 --> 01:02:38.698]  And remember, Michael Morell was adamant in his opposition to Donald Trump, adamant in his support of Hillary Clinton.
[01:02:38.738 --> 01:02:42.681]  He points out in August he not only endorsed Clinton in the pages of the New York Times.
[01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:45.723]  Isn't that interesting that we have CIA officials doing that?
[01:02:47.003 --> 01:02:49.924]  And even sitting CIA officials in this last election.
[01:02:49.964 --> 01:02:51.185]  That should tell you something right there.
[01:02:51.245 --> 01:02:53.906]  The fact that these leaks are coming from the intelligence community.
[01:02:53.926 --> 01:02:59.229]  The fact that we had CIA officials actively involving themselves in politics.
[01:02:59.529 --> 01:03:00.450]  Oh, nothing to see there.
[01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:01.550]  Just move on.
[01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:04.552]  They're not trying to hack our election, are they?
[01:03:04.872 --> 01:03:05.612]  Not the CIA.
[01:03:05.652 --> 01:03:07.633]  They would never hack American elections.
[01:03:08.093 --> 01:03:10.394]  Only the 81 or so foreign elections.
[01:03:10.474 --> 01:03:15.097]  They go on to say, this guy, however, even though he was the first high official
[01:03:15.717 --> 01:03:25.606]  To explicitly accuse Trump of disloyalty, he now says, quote, in the intelligence business, we would say Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.
[01:03:26.167 --> 01:03:27.027]  That's what he said then.
[01:03:27.087 --> 01:03:38.318]  But now, on Wednesday night, this same former CIA agent appeared at an intelligence community to cast doubt on, quote, allegations that members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.
[01:03:39.648 --> 01:03:46.712]  Obama's former CIA chief also cast serious doubt on the credibility of the infamous explosive dossier.
[01:03:46.832 --> 01:03:54.817]  Remember they called it the dossier when BuzzFeed published those unsubstantiated ad hominem attacks and rumors and character assassination.
[01:03:54.837 --> 01:03:57.139]  The dossier, he says, doesn't take you anywhere.
[01:03:57.279 --> 01:03:59.260]  Well, we know that it doesn't take anybody anywhere.
[01:04:00.874 --> 01:04:04.017]  BuzzFeed was sued by a Russian tech executive that was named in it.
[01:04:04.097 --> 01:04:06.140]  They didn't do any follow-up reporting.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:15.830]  BuzzFeed themselves said, well, we don't really believe this, when everybody on both the left and the right, the pro-Trump, the anti-Trump media, everybody criticized BuzzFeed.
[01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:19.674]  They said, well, we don't really believe it, but we have an obligation to publish these unbelievable claims.
[01:04:20.353 --> 01:04:21.654]  That's what they said at the time.
[01:04:22.074 --> 01:04:32.761]  Today, however, we had Democrat Congressman Adam Schiff questioning Comey, FBI Director Comey, and the two of them are pretending that there is something in this dossier.
[01:04:33.301 --> 01:04:35.843]  See, that's how obvious this has become.
[01:04:36.063 --> 01:04:44.268]  That's why many of us believe that this is nothing other than the beginnings of a coup or the threat of a coup against Donald Trump.
[01:04:45.345 --> 01:04:49.869]  Again, the White House responded today and said there's absolutely no evidence of a Trump-Russia collusion.
[01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:54.454]  Nothing has changed, said a senior official in an email.
[01:04:55.035 --> 01:05:03.903]  Said senior Obama intelligence officials have gone on record to confirm that there is no evidence of a Trump-Russia collusion, and there is no evidence of a Trump-Russia scandal.
[01:05:03.963 --> 01:05:08.608]  They have produced absolutely nothing today, and yet they continue to go on.
[01:05:09.122 --> 01:05:19.405]  Meanwhile, Donald Trump tweeted out today as it was going on, he said FBI Director Comey refuses to deny that he briefed President Obama on calls made by Michael Flynn to Russia.
[01:05:20.585 --> 01:05:35.589]  And I just want to remind you again, when we look at this Russia information, one of the things that came out in Vault 7, as they were denying that Donald Trump had been wiretapped or eavesdropped whatsoever, one of the other things that came out
[01:05:36.638 --> 01:05:43.281]  Was the revelation in these documents that the CIA can misdirect their cyber attacks to look like someone else.
[01:05:44.682 --> 01:05:49.304]  This, of course, was said over and over again by security experts that we interviewed.
[01:05:49.344 --> 01:06:03.932]  Today, earlier, I talked to John McAfee, and he was reminding us that he had told us months ago, when this all came out, he said, nobody but an absolute incompetent would leave these kind of fingerprints that they say identify the Russians as being involved.
[01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:12.812]  John McAfee said, the people that they grab with this are the 15-year-olds who still manage to do a lot of damage, but they eventually find them because they're 15-year-olds.
[01:06:13.412 --> 01:06:15.973]  This is not the work of a state security system, he said.
[01:06:16.033 --> 01:06:18.374]  And here's what Vault 7 said.
[01:06:18.394 --> 01:06:27.276]  According to WikiLeaks, the CIA collects attack techniques stolen from malware produced in other states, including Russia, via a project called Umbridge.
[01:06:27.976 --> 01:06:39.808]  The CIA does this for many reasons, but one use they can do is to leave behind fingerprints that misdirect attribution, making it look like their cyber attack was done by somebody else, like Russia, for example.
[01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:49.197]  So when they tell you, look, we found this, and we found this, that looks like it was written on a Cyrillic keyboard, so therefore it must be Russian.
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:58.685]  Again, as McAfee pointed out, the software that was used was well known, that they allege was used, was well known, and it was even an old rev of that software.
[01:06:59.366 --> 01:07:00.186]  No state...
[01:07:01.388 --> 01:07:09.533]  Cyber security hackers would use something that was that old, that out of date, that obvious, and they would not leave their fingerprints.
[01:07:09.613 --> 01:07:14.595]  What a state organization would do is leave the fingerprints of another state organization.
[01:07:14.916 --> 01:07:15.936]  That's the way these people do.
[01:07:15.956 --> 01:07:24.021]  And of course, over the weekend, as Alex covered at great length today, talking to Jerome Corsi as well as to Mike Zullo, we also have
[01:07:24.801 --> 01:07:29.224]  The NSA documents that prove surveillance of Donald Trump and his family.
[01:07:29.804 --> 01:07:33.167]  This is something that was part of Sheriff Arpaio's investigation.
[01:07:33.807 --> 01:07:40.151]  It was done by a, documents that were given out by a whistleblower who had worked as a contractor for the CIA.
[01:07:41.272 --> 01:07:50.459]  And in this, we see that not only did they have the records of a lot of citizens, but they had 18 different addresses that they were spying on Donald Trump.
[01:07:50.479 --> 01:07:55.743]  They had nine of his employees, people like a golf pro and others, that they were looking at.
[01:07:55.763 --> 01:07:57.084]  They were looking at Alex Jones.
[01:07:57.384 --> 01:08:00.086]  And that's precisely what we've seen from Michael Hayden.
[01:08:00.586 --> 01:08:05.329]  He admitted that the NSA is not interested in bad people.
[01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:09.512]  He said the NSA is interested in interesting people.
[01:08:10.424 --> 01:08:13.786]  Do you think that candidate Trump was interesting to the NSA?
[01:08:14.687 --> 01:08:18.289]  Do you think that President-elect Trump was interesting to the NSA?
[01:08:18.729 --> 01:08:19.369]  To Obama?
[01:08:19.650 --> 01:08:24.452]  Do you think the people who spy on everyone about everything would be interested in that?
[01:08:24.613 --> 01:08:25.293]  Of course they are.
[01:08:26.174 --> 01:08:29.936]  And finally today we learned that this is an ongoing thing, folks.
[01:08:31.096 --> 01:08:34.438]  As WikiLeaks has pointed out, not only did the CIA
[01:08:35.919 --> 01:08:40.341]  Fund these exploits, and we were warned about that by Aaron Schwartz before he was killed.
[01:08:40.521 --> 01:08:41.382]  I believe he was killed.
[01:08:41.402 --> 01:08:42.763]  I don't believe that he committed suicide.
[01:08:42.803 --> 01:08:44.744]  This is a guy who fought.
[01:08:45.324 --> 01:08:48.126]  He was a meek guy, but he was not weak.
[01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:50.387]  This is a guy who was very tough.
[01:08:51.247 --> 01:09:01.813]  He repeatedly opposed the entire surveillance organization and shut down repeatedly these efforts called ACTA, SOPA, PIPA, CISPA, multiple times.
[01:09:02.827 --> 01:09:06.090]  They passed a version of CISPA over his dead body.
[01:09:07.331 --> 01:09:15.759]  But one of the things that he told us was that the government was funding and creating virtually all these exploits at great cost to the American taxpayer.
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:21.344]  And not just at a dollar cost to us, but the true cost that we see.
[01:09:22.065 --> 01:09:27.030]  It's not only the loss of privacy, but the loss of security and safety as well.
[01:09:28.083 --> 01:09:35.913]  When the government destroys the rule of law, when the government destroys your liberty, when the government destroys your privacy, you are not safer.
[01:09:36.613 --> 01:09:37.354]  You are not secure.
[01:09:38.254 --> 01:10:00.064]  When the government gives hackers worldwide, whether they're individual criminals or whether they're states, the tools to break into your house, essentially, to your personal effects, to collect information from you, when they create those tools, when they carelessly lose those tools and they go into the public domain, you are not safer, are you?
[01:10:01.544 --> 01:10:02.485]  See, this is a false
[01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:19.319]  It is a Faustian deal, in the same sense that usually, as you see in his Faustian plays, the devil has got two different sides that he's playing, and that's what the people in the surveillance community are doing to us.
[01:10:19.419 --> 01:10:24.362]  Today we see that some electronics are going to be banned on some U.S.-bound flights.
[01:10:24.782 --> 01:10:32.126]  Here's an example of the ongoing insecurity that we face because of, exactly because of our
[01:10:33.058 --> 01:10:33.919]  Intelligence community.
[01:10:33.939 --> 01:10:44.710]  They say Royal Jordanian Airlines is advising passengers that laptops, iPads, cameras and other electronics will not be allowed in carry-on luggage for U.S.-bound flights starting tomorrow, Tuesday.
[01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:47.593]  They say Homeland Security is declining to comment.
[01:10:47.633 --> 01:10:51.918]  Of course they are, because you, the American public, are to be left in the dark about everything.
[01:10:52.608 --> 01:11:01.294]  The Hill continues on to say that that tweet was later deleted, but a State Department source told CNN that affected countries and airlines are being informed of the ban.
[01:11:01.334 --> 01:11:08.019]  The ban does not apply to cell phones or to medical devices, but it does include, as I point out, laptops, tablets, electronic games, and cameras.
[01:11:08.079 --> 01:11:11.101]  Those items can be stored in checked baggage, however.
[01:11:11.741 --> 01:11:15.729]  And it appears to apply to 13 countries for the next 96 hours.
[01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:19.195]  You see, once they create these things, they leave them out there.
[01:11:19.756 --> 01:11:20.818]  And they continue to go on.
[01:11:21.158 --> 01:11:23.362]  Now I'll give you one more example of this.
[01:11:24.209 --> 01:11:29.173]  Wicked Leaks talked about this Vault 7 update on Twitter today.
[01:11:29.873 --> 01:11:34.177]  But understand that the first release of documents was simply that, just the first release.
[01:11:34.197 --> 01:11:44.545]  There are going to be many other releases talking about how the CIA has violated the law, the Constitution, and its charter, spying on Americans, and creating vulnerabilities.
[01:11:45.245 --> 01:11:46.186]  And they had this to say.
[01:11:46.687 --> 01:11:49.369]  They said, while Mozilla, the people who create Firefox,
[01:11:50.253 --> 01:11:54.935]  has worked with WikiLeaks because WikiLeaks is acting like a white hat hacker.
[01:11:55.255 --> 01:12:05.820]  In other words, they have identified the hack, and as they should, they're making it known to the people who own the software, like Firefox, and say, here's the vulnerability that was found.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.322]  Here's how this vulnerability works so that you can fix it.
[01:12:09.762 --> 01:12:13.103]  That's the purpose of doing this, what white hat hackers do.
[01:12:13.583 --> 01:12:17.065]  And they say organizations like Mozilla have exchanged letters with WikiLeaks.
[01:12:17.085 --> 01:12:18.546]  They're working on fixing the vulnerability.
[01:12:19.875 --> 01:12:27.022]  Wicked Leaks says, Google and some other companies have yet to respond other than to confirm receipt of our initial approach.
[01:12:27.642 --> 01:12:33.368]  They have not agreed or disagreed or even questioned our industry standard responsible disclosure plan.
[01:12:33.788 --> 01:12:40.695]  Most of these lagging companies, this is important, have conflicts of interest due to their classified work for U.S.
[01:12:40.715 --> 01:12:41.515]  government agencies.
[01:12:42.156 --> 01:12:46.441]  In practice, such associations limit industry staff with U.S.
[01:12:46.461 --> 01:12:51.067]  security clearances from fixing security holes based on leaked information from the CIA.
[01:12:51.407 --> 01:12:51.988]  You understand that?
[01:12:53.429 --> 01:13:01.199]  If they've got a contract with the government and they have security clearance, they don't want them to fix vulnerabilities.
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:07.361]  How's that for our intelligence services that say that they're there to make you more safe, more secure?
[01:13:07.841 --> 01:13:11.662]  They deliberately block them from fixing these vulnerabilities.
[01:13:11.782 --> 01:13:13.043]  And then they tell you this.
[01:13:13.603 --> 01:13:16.763]  They said, well, users may want to think about this.
[01:13:17.284 --> 01:13:26.746]  You may prefer to use software from organizations like Mozilla or from European countries that prioritize their users over their government contracts.
[01:13:27.626 --> 01:13:39.991]  Should these companies continue to drag their feet, we will create a league table comparing company responsiveness and government entanglements so that users can decide for themselves.
[01:13:40.031 --> 01:13:41.111]  That's what Julian Assange said.
[01:13:41.131 --> 01:13:50.455]  So he's going to say which companies have refused to fix the vulnerabilities, and he's also going to show you how close their ties are to the American economy.
[01:13:51.952 --> 01:14:02.518]  I don't want to go right now to Leanne McAdoo and Owen Schroer.
[01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:07.081]  I want to get their comments on Donald Trump's speech in Louisville, Kentucky.
[01:14:07.101 --> 01:14:11.803]  And we're going to take your phone calls in just a moment and get your comments as well.
[01:14:12.864 --> 01:14:14.745]  Do we have the number that they're going to call in?
[01:14:14.765 --> 01:14:19.008]  Because I know this is a different number than we have during the show, during the day.
[01:14:20.131 --> 01:14:20.551]  Okay.
[01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:21.652]  Okay.
[01:14:21.672 --> 01:14:22.832]  We're going to get that number in a moment.
[01:14:22.952 --> 01:14:28.114]  Let's go to Owen and Leanne and your comments on Donald Trump's speech tonight.
[01:14:29.295 --> 01:14:30.395]  Well, thanks a lot, David.
[01:14:30.775 --> 01:14:34.236]  And, you know, it was pretty much the typical speech, I think, Leanne.
[01:14:34.256 --> 01:14:38.018]  You know, a lot of this stuff is starting to get cliché, even for my taste.
[01:14:38.538 --> 01:14:45.521]  But, you know, for example, one of the clichés that he hit, and it kind of made me think like, okay, Donald, you're getting a little cliché, was when he started saying,
[01:14:46.101 --> 01:14:47.723]  We're going to put the coal miners back to work.
[01:14:47.743 --> 01:14:49.045]  We're going to go to clean coal.
[01:14:49.465 --> 01:14:50.506]  But he's actually doing that.
[01:14:50.566 --> 01:14:52.969]  He actually did put coal miners back to work.
[01:14:53.009 --> 01:14:54.872]  He actually is trying to rejuvenate the coal industry.
[01:14:54.932 --> 01:14:57.255]  So, it's not just cliche.
[01:14:57.295 --> 01:14:58.296]  He is backing it up.
[01:14:59.137 --> 01:15:02.001]  And, you know, here's the other thing to this for me, Leanne.
[01:15:03.297 --> 01:15:05.918]  I said this in the Hot Topic I did for the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:06.519 --> 01:15:15.283]  Basically everything that we're seeing, all these hearings, all these false narratives, and everything that's going on, is basically the Democrat globalist presidential campaign for 2020.
[01:15:16.203 --> 01:15:28.529]  They're starting it right now, they're doing it with fake news, they're doing it with these hearings, they're trying to draw all this negative attention, these negative headlines to Trump, and then when the real campaign starts, even though it's already started for them,
[01:15:29.449 --> 01:15:31.150]  Then they're going to bring the fake news up.
[01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:32.251]  They're going to attack him on it.
[01:15:32.331 --> 01:15:35.133]  That's going to be the campaign story, trying to go on that fake news.
[01:15:35.213 --> 01:15:38.895]  So, to me, this is now Trump campaigning.
[01:15:39.456 --> 01:15:45.520]  This has to be Trump's campaign strategy to counter all the fake news and everything.
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:54.406]  I mean, so here you go folks, we're literally, we're not even 100 days into Donald Trump's presidency and he's already having to campaign for 2020.
[01:15:56.207 --> 01:15:57.589]  I think you're absolutely right on that.
[01:15:57.649 --> 01:15:58.630]  And that's, you're right.
[01:15:58.650 --> 01:16:05.036]  And he knows the only way that he can kind of get in front of the narrative is by going to Twitter or by having these rallies where he can call out the fake news.
[01:16:05.617 --> 01:16:09.361]  But it's really interesting that right now they are completely salivating over this story.
[01:16:09.861 --> 01:16:13.605]  Oh, well, Donald Trump was under FBI investigation as well in 2016.
[01:16:14.146 --> 01:16:15.347]  How great is America?
[01:16:15.407 --> 01:16:18.230]  We had both presidential candidates under FBI investigation.
[01:16:19.291 --> 01:16:28.756]  There was no, not a peep, totally crickets when we were all screaming, what the heck, you've got a Democratic candidate who is under FBI investigation.
[01:16:29.216 --> 01:16:30.717]  That was no big deal.
[01:16:31.077 --> 01:16:32.197]  You know, there was nothing.
[01:16:32.538 --> 01:16:36.019]  The Attorney General met with Hillary Clinton's husband on the tarmac.
[01:16:36.059 --> 01:16:37.800]  That was much ado about nothing.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.161]  They were just talking about the kids and summer camp.
[01:16:40.181 --> 01:16:41.242]  Right, even though it was illegal.
[01:16:41.562 --> 01:16:43.463]  Yeah, so that was no big deal.
[01:16:43.543 --> 01:16:48.706]  I mean, it's just incredible the amount of power and steam that is behind certain people.
[01:16:49.026 --> 01:16:55.169]  So, of course, they're going to turn that around to take out their main opposition here, President Trump.
[01:16:55.189 --> 01:17:06.175]  But this is just, I've never even experienced anything like this, to just see how much people are trying to take him out to the point that now that they're saying, after this hearing, we could impeach him.
[01:17:06.815 --> 01:17:08.797]  Hang on a second before we get any more comments from you.
[01:17:08.837 --> 01:17:09.918]  I want to put that number out there.
[01:17:09.938 --> 01:17:10.799]  I've now got that number.
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.503]  It is 877-789-2539.
[01:17:14.704 --> 01:17:26.556]  That's 877-789-ALEX if you want to call in and comment about Donald Trump's speech tonight or about the hearings that we had with James Comey on the Hill today.
[01:17:26.597 --> 01:17:27.578]  That was absolutely...
[01:17:28.338 --> 01:17:33.399]  Absolutely disgusting display that we saw with Comey and the rest of Congress.
[01:17:33.639 --> 01:17:38.440]  He didn't address that directly as far as I heard tonight in the comments from the legal team.
[01:17:39.061 --> 01:17:49.223]  Absolutely nothing about that, but I was just reading, which I didn't know, I don't know if maybe you guys had heard of it, since Judge Andrew Napolitano was speaking on Thursday, he has not been on Fox News.
[01:17:49.263 --> 01:17:51.784]  They say he's been basically cut from Fox News.
[01:17:51.824 --> 01:17:56.485]  He won't be back on at all for the foreseeable future according to these sources.
[01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:57.125]  So more censorship.
[01:17:57.805 --> 01:18:03.130]  Because of, he was furthering the wiretap claims, saying that this is what his sources told him.
[01:18:03.230 --> 01:18:06.373]  He says he stands by it, but... Furthering the claims?
[01:18:06.573 --> 01:18:07.994]  It's been proven in triplicate!
[01:18:08.035 --> 01:18:09.136]  I mean, give me a break!
[01:18:09.316 --> 01:18:12.138]  Yeah, I mean, he is, uh, this is incredible.
[01:18:12.158 --> 01:18:20.766]  He's always been someone who's spoken out against, you know, he talked about the false flags and how they're a lot of times perpetrated by the government.
[01:18:20.806 --> 01:18:22.228]  He put that on the mainstream media.
[01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:23.908]  Well, that's absolutely amazing.
[01:18:24.348 --> 01:18:34.650]  For anybody to pretend that we don't have wiretapping going on illegally in this government, after all the revelations that we've had with Snowden and otherwise, that is absolutely amazing.
[01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:52.033]  It's one of the things I thought was so disgusting, so amazing of what Stephen Colbert did, to pretend that we don't have, at five years to the day, after David Petraeus's CIA director said, we're going to listen to you through all of your appliances, to mock Kellyanne Conway, because she said, well, they'll be listening to you through your television, through your phone, through your microwave.
[01:18:52.473 --> 01:18:52.834]  Of course!
[01:18:53.434 --> 01:18:54.656]  Everything that is hooked up.
[01:18:54.696 --> 01:19:05.468]  Look, if you have any device that has a camera, a microphone in it, if you're talking to that device and it is doing speech processing and it has to be connected to the internet.
[01:19:05.488 --> 01:19:09.252]  So if it's got a microphone and it's connected to the internet, guess what folks?
[01:19:09.833 --> 01:19:11.375]  They can use that to spy on you.
[01:19:11.395 --> 01:19:13.737]  They can leave that microphone on all the time.
[01:19:13.977 --> 01:19:17.941]  But now, to me, it's amazing how they want to pretend that none of this stuff exists.
[01:19:17.981 --> 01:19:22.125]  And there is Stephen Colbert clowning around, sticking his head in the microwave oven.
[01:19:22.485 --> 01:19:25.187]  Just turn on the oven, Colbert.
[01:19:25.308 --> 01:19:26.609]  It won't make any difference.
[01:19:27.109 --> 01:19:27.949]  Yeah, turn it on.
[01:19:27.969 --> 01:19:29.710]  Stick your head in the oven while you're at it.
[01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:30.310]  Turn it on.
[01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:33.131]  Well, I mean, this is very interesting, though.
[01:19:34.111 --> 01:19:41.493]  I was reading something last week where I do believe it was James Comey where he said, you know, there was not a physical wiretap placed in the Trump Tower.
[01:19:41.533 --> 01:19:46.374]  Like, we're not talking about a physical, you know, what is this, the 1950s?
[01:19:46.394 --> 01:19:47.394]  We're not talking about that.
[01:19:48.254 --> 01:19:49.375]  We live in a wireless world.
[01:19:50.675 --> 01:19:52.916]  Wait, you said you mean like hacking, right?
[01:19:52.956 --> 01:19:54.456]  Like Russian hacking the election?
[01:19:54.776 --> 01:20:02.739]  See, they have these double standards where they'll say Russian hacking the election, but when Donald Trump says wiretapping, they want that to be taken literally.
[01:20:02.919 --> 01:20:06.020]  But when they say Russian hacking the election, they don't want that to be taken literally.
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.420]  So there's another double standard.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:13.102]  And let's just recall, this is a government that we know will target people based on their political beliefs.
[01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:14.502]  Just look at Lois Lerner.
[01:20:14.983 --> 01:20:18.864]  And for the ultimate double standard for me today, guys, from James Comey,
[01:20:19.904 --> 01:20:37.114]  He's sitting on the hill today talking about how serious it is for classified documents to get out, how serious it is for national intelligence and security documents to get out, and how the offense is punishable by up to 10 years and all this stuff.
[01:20:37.154 --> 01:20:47.621]  I mean, oh my gosh, he's making this huge deal about, oh my gosh, we have to make sure that any classified documents are kept secret, we cannot share these, we cannot have Russian hacking, we cannot have any hacking, yada, yada, yada.
[01:20:49.298 --> 01:20:55.126]  Where was that James Comey when he was deciding not to prosecute Hillary Clinton?
[01:20:55.146 --> 01:20:55.587]  Right.
[01:20:55.827 --> 01:20:59.652]  What about all the classified information that she had on her email server that got hacked?
[01:20:59.692 --> 01:21:00.994]  Right, they're coming after Roger Stone.
[01:21:01.014 --> 01:21:02.256]  So where was that James Comey?
[01:21:02.456 --> 01:21:05.060]  Well they're coming after Roger Stone because he had some...
[01:21:06.521 --> 01:21:06.802]  Totally.
[01:21:25.763 --> 01:21:54.797]  So they got the email address and so there you I mean she could have been sending classified information the entire time but that's not a big deal that's not you know that tie with Guccifer it's Roger Stone and the fact that he I mean he he put out his tweets I mean they were completely innocuous they meant nothing so it's just the double standard here is it's really incredible to watch to see the amount of people that are so kind of blinded by what's really happening here in this agenda this machine
[01:21:55.157 --> 01:22:07.773]  Well, and as we watched President Trump speak tonight, it is worth mentioning that there was a presidential debate in France today, and Le Pen is still considered the frontrunner despite everything they're doing to them.
[01:22:08.233 --> 01:22:13.600]  And David, the big story tonight from the Trump rally had to be the size of the crowd
[01:22:14.281 --> 01:22:20.664]  They're saying up to 20,000 people got into this arena, and even more were waiting outside, unable to get in.
[01:22:20.704 --> 01:22:27.568]  So the story, I think, the biggest story, at least right now on social media and everywhere, is just the size of the crowd that attended Trump's rally tonight.
[01:22:27.588 --> 01:22:39.054]  I think it's very important for Trump, as he's being attacked in Washington by both Democrats and Republicans, it is imperative for him, not only, as I pointed out last week when he did this, I said, look at this, he's really enjoying it, it's a break for him to get out of that.
[01:22:39.414 --> 01:22:40.355]  There was a way.
[01:22:40.395 --> 01:22:40.535]  A way.
[01:22:52.423 --> 01:22:52.763]  Right.
[01:22:52.983 --> 01:22:54.464]  Did you guys know that there was a wave?
[01:22:54.524 --> 01:22:56.785]  You know, if you're at a football game, the crowds do the wave?
[01:22:57.405 --> 01:23:00.647]  We had a wave at a political event.
[01:23:00.887 --> 01:23:01.107]  Yeah.
[01:23:01.287 --> 01:23:03.728]  That has to be, is that the first ever?
[01:23:03.748 --> 01:23:05.929]  I mean, seriously, I mean, I know that's kind of crazy.
[01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:08.891]  Also, people were pointing out that this is a county that he lost.
[01:23:08.991 --> 01:23:09.451]  A wave?
[01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:11.092]  That he didn't, Hillary Clinton won.
[01:23:11.112 --> 01:23:11.952]  What's going on?
[01:23:12.032 --> 01:23:14.334]  So it's just interesting to see the amount of support that he has.
[01:23:14.394 --> 01:23:17.035]  And there were some protesters there, some Black Lives Matter people got
[01:23:17.535 --> 01:23:21.678]  Thrown out, but the majority of people there were in support.
[01:23:21.758 --> 01:23:26.783]  So it's interesting that he didn't even win in this particular county.
[01:23:26.803 --> 01:23:32.067]  And his little jibe, he said, I'll worry about jobs, you guys just worry about your basketball team.
[01:23:33.328 --> 01:23:34.929]  Let's take a couple of phone calls.
[01:23:34.949 --> 01:23:37.891]  Basketball team lost, that was kind of a jibe, they didn't appreciate that one.
[01:23:37.931 --> 01:23:40.353]  Oh, and Leanne, let's take a couple of phone calls.
[01:23:40.393 --> 01:23:42.555]  We've got people that have queued up on here.
[01:23:42.575 --> 01:23:45.257]  Let's go to Mark in New York.
[01:23:45.337 --> 01:23:45.878]  Mark, go ahead.
[01:23:47.682 --> 01:23:48.122]  How are you?
[01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:49.043]  Doing great.
[01:23:50.164 --> 01:23:53.487]  Owen and Leanne, I enjoy you guys every time you're on.
[01:23:54.288 --> 01:23:55.048]  Well, thank you.
[01:23:55.749 --> 01:23:57.891]  Totally hooked on X2.
[01:23:58.651 --> 01:24:06.718]  And I, like I said, absolutely riveted by your programming and what you guys say, because it needs to be said, obviously.
[01:24:07.399 --> 01:24:14.185]  And I'm a 40-year broadcaster from New York State and I'm currently working, but I'm looking
[01:24:14.724 --> 01:24:18.726]  I think I'm going to move and get out of what I'm doing and get into something that means a little bit more, if you know what I mean.
[01:24:19.646 --> 01:24:24.047]  I've been following Comey all day, and it's ridiculous.
[01:24:24.088 --> 01:24:25.008]  He really should be gone.
[01:24:26.769 --> 01:24:28.049]  Do you feel like he's politicized?
[01:24:28.069 --> 01:24:30.830]  Seriously.
[01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:34.731]  Do you think he's better or worse than Jagger Hoover?
[01:24:35.812 --> 01:24:37.513]  Well, you know, I followed Hoover.
[01:24:37.553 --> 01:24:38.533]  I read the Hoover book.
[01:24:39.053 --> 01:24:43.175]  And, you know, to be honest with you, Hoover was out of control.
[01:24:44.778 --> 01:24:48.220]  Comey is out of control, and he really needs to be gone.
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:53.102]  He can go on national television, like you said, and just spin the truth.
[01:24:53.502 --> 01:24:56.043]  All of a sudden, you know, he didn't do this.
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:07.767]  You know, when you go back at Comey and you look at what he did with Hillary Clinton saying, look, you know, she violated the law, but I'm not going to prosecute her.
[01:25:07.807 --> 01:25:13.751]  You know, she violated national security multiple times, but that's not something that we're going to come after her because she's a big person.
[01:25:14.432 --> 01:25:21.917]  And just turning his, you know, just coming after her later, but not coming after her then, then coming after Donald Trump and playing both sides of this.
[01:25:21.977 --> 01:25:22.458]  I mean, I have.
[01:25:23.398 --> 01:25:30.822]  This guy, the difference between what we're seeing now versus Watergate, versus Jagger, Hoover, is the fact that these people have absolutely no shame about it.
[01:25:31.462 --> 01:25:41.688]  When, during the Nixon administration, the IRS, he wanted the IRS to spy on enemies, and it was the IRS commissioner who turned in Nixon, but now we've got IRS commissioners who do it for the president, who did it for Obama.
[01:25:42.228 --> 01:25:43.249]  That's the difference today.
[01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:59.391]  I've been here my whole life, never done nothing wrong, but now all these things that came out with Hillary, are we ever going to see the repercussions of the original WikiLeaks?
[01:26:00.572 --> 01:26:00.932]  That's right.
[01:26:01.292 --> 01:26:01.512]  Yeah.
[01:26:01.933 --> 01:26:05.734]  Well, you know, it'll be interesting to see what happens, and I'm interested to see what else comes out with Vault 7.
[01:26:05.774 --> 01:26:09.716]  But people continue to pretend that none of this stuff exists.
[01:26:10.356 --> 01:26:17.399]  That we don't have the documentation, that we haven't had the confessions from David Petraeus, that they're going to spy on us through our appliances.
[01:26:17.559 --> 01:26:18.799]  None of that exists!
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.280]  So just forget about it.
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:21.781]  Donald Trump is delusional.
[01:26:22.081 --> 01:26:28.804]  It's bizarre that he would even make these claims, and we've got to take Judge Napolitano off the air because he points out the obvious.
[01:26:28.844 --> 01:26:29.404]  This is just
[01:26:29.964 --> 01:26:31.665]  Really, Orwellian, what's happening here?
[01:26:32.225 --> 01:26:40.750]  It's funny, I'm about 65 miles from Manhattan, and of course, the closer you get to the city, you know, the more left you see.
[01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:59.240]  And my folks are in their 80s, they were young when they had me, but you know, they're like a little stronghold there, and they're so tired of the mainstream media, and that's all I have, because they're not online, and they just don't get it, and they don't realize that there are so many people on our side, you know, trying to get this all straightened out.
[01:26:59.815 --> 01:27:00.336]  And can we?
[01:27:00.436 --> 01:27:00.956]  And will we?
[01:27:01.356 --> 01:27:02.117]  And what will happen?
[01:27:02.157 --> 01:27:06.901]  I think everybody's waiting for just, you know, that moment where, you know, this all gets broken.
[01:27:07.161 --> 01:27:07.722]  That's true, Mark.
[01:27:07.762 --> 01:27:12.246]  And of course, part of this attack really has to be against the independent media.
[01:27:12.286 --> 01:27:18.832]  That's why today we saw McClatchy and others saying, well, there are bots out there that are pushing InfoWars stories.
[01:27:19.472 --> 01:27:21.154]  And these are false stories.
[01:27:21.214 --> 01:27:22.175]  Not any specifics.
[01:27:22.275 --> 01:27:24.177]  Never come after any particular story.
[01:27:24.237 --> 01:27:25.198]  No details on any story.
[01:27:25.218 --> 01:27:27.440]  Just, well, we think that there's some fake news.
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:28.221]  All of that stuff.
[01:27:28.241 --> 01:27:33.466]  But now they're coming after us and saying we're part of this vast red herring conspiracy.
[01:27:33.586 --> 01:27:33.986]  Thank you, Mark.
[01:27:34.026 --> 01:27:36.048]  Let's move on to some of our other callers.
[01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:37.870]  Tyrell in British Columbia.
[01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:38.631]  Go ahead, Tyrell.
[01:27:40.152 --> 01:27:40.613]  Hey, E3.
[01:27:40.653 --> 01:27:41.153]  How's it going?
[01:27:41.754 --> 01:27:42.114]  Doing good.
[01:27:42.134 --> 01:27:42.435]  Hey there.
[01:27:42.515 --> 01:27:42.795]  What you got?
[01:27:44.146 --> 01:28:01.197]  Well, one of the things I wanted to bring up here, I'm hoping it's not already been covered, but I was mapping a few things on my tablet a few weeks ago, and I had my Wi-Fi on, did my thing, left my house, and a little blue dot followed me on the highway.
[01:28:01.797 --> 01:28:04.939]  Every couple of feet, every mile, it would move.
[01:28:05.379 --> 01:28:10.182]  Now, I'm in the middle of my car, in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of having no Wi-Fi.
[01:28:11.283 --> 01:28:12.724]  How does it know when I'm moving?
[01:28:13.334 --> 01:28:14.921]  I mean, it would have a connection to a satellite.
[01:28:15.966 --> 01:28:17.653]  So, you kind of see where I'm going with this.
[01:28:18.379 --> 01:28:25.444]  Yeah, well, I mean, there's also on your iPads, you can possibly have a connection to the cell phone coverage, depending on how you're set up.
[01:28:25.764 --> 01:28:26.285]  I agree with you.
[01:28:26.325 --> 01:28:29.687]  And of course, they will also store that if you don't specifically turn that off.
[01:28:29.787 --> 01:28:38.593]  And then, Apple, or whoever the company is, can now turn that information over to your government and not be sued here in America because of CISA.
[01:28:39.254 --> 01:28:43.557]  That's given them immunity from violating your privacy and turning over that information to the government.
[01:28:44.417 --> 01:28:45.458]  Yeah, it's just my tablet.
[01:28:45.498 --> 01:28:47.740]  It's not connected to my phone or any of that stuff.
[01:28:48.582 --> 01:28:52.745]  Um, but as the gentleman earlier was saying, a bunch of Canadians aren't too happy with Trump.
[01:28:52.765 --> 01:28:53.646]  You're damn right.
[01:28:54.146 --> 01:28:55.547]  He's like Canada's Obama.
[01:28:55.587 --> 01:28:58.269]  A lot of my buddies, like, we despise him.
[01:28:59.010 --> 01:29:01.192]  Oh, you mean Trudeau?
[01:29:01.232 --> 01:29:02.032]  They're not happy with Trudeau?
[01:29:02.052 --> 01:29:02.933]  Oh, he's a story, yeah.
[01:29:03.173 --> 01:29:03.573]  Oh my God.
[01:29:04.154 --> 01:29:06.035]  They like Trump, but they don't like Trudeau.
[01:29:06.836 --> 01:29:08.497]  Yeah, no, a lot of us love Trump.
[01:29:08.537 --> 01:29:09.918]  A lot of people don't, but whatever.
[01:29:10.318 --> 01:29:10.759]  I love him.
[01:29:10.879 --> 01:29:13.761]  I've got some stuff from your guys' store, including the 2020 shirt.
[01:29:14.281 --> 01:29:16.223]  I wish we had a Canadian Trump.
[01:29:16.775 --> 01:29:20.377]  And if I had the cheddar to run for it, you're damn right I'd run for Prime Minister.
[01:29:23.179 --> 01:29:40.451]  It takes a very special person to put up with all that and also be able to manipulate the media in the ways to get coverage because one of the easiest things for the media to do is to just spike somebody who would be a very good candidate, who would be a good president or governor or whatever, they just refuse to cover them.
[01:29:40.491 --> 01:29:42.772]  We see that all the time with independent third-party candidates.
[01:29:43.072 --> 01:29:45.454]  That was what was so amazing about Donald Trump.
[01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:48.656]  Hey guys, first I want to say I use a lot of your products and they're freaking awesome.
[01:30:11.744 --> 01:30:11.964]  Thank you.
[01:30:26.724 --> 01:30:27.985]  Yeah, it's very important.
[01:30:28.005 --> 01:30:37.730]  People don't realize that, you know, the things that we're selling, it's very easy to verify on the internet, these long-term studies that people have done on things like selenium, for example.
[01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:40.511]  So then your question is, what's a good source of selenium?
[01:30:40.551 --> 01:30:46.215]  And we do really a lot to try to make sure that we have the very best quality that you can get out there.
[01:30:46.235 --> 01:30:54.179]  And people can look on the internet, do your own independent research on these different supplements, and you'll see what that's about, how important that is with selenium, with other things.
[01:30:54.659 --> 01:30:54.919]  Thank you.
[01:30:54.959 --> 01:30:56.180]  What did you want to talk about, Matt?
[01:30:57.242 --> 01:31:07.226]  Yeah, I want to touch a little bit on what Ellen said about Comey and how he cannot assure the wiretapping leaks the New York Times will be investigating.
[01:31:07.246 --> 01:31:15.270]  It's kind of interesting because NSA Director Michael Rogers claimed that only 20 people in the NSA have unmasking authorization.
[01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:24.654]  And then Comey dies, Representative Gowdy's question on how many agencies can unmask names, and then he dies if he briefed Obama the names.
[01:31:26.115 --> 01:31:38.643]  As Owen said earlier, how he was like, um, cannot assure the wiretapping, but then he reassures how if anyone else does it, it's a really bad thing.
[01:31:38.963 --> 01:31:40.204]  And he did that with Hillary, too.
[01:31:41.005 --> 01:31:44.026]  Like you guys were saying earlier, he was like, oh, you know.
[01:31:44.307 --> 01:31:45.207]  Leaking is bad.
[01:31:45.227 --> 01:31:47.609]  Yeah, and then blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:31:47.809 --> 01:31:49.430]  And I broke this a little bit down here.
[01:31:49.450 --> 01:31:51.191]  I have a little aggregation blog I have.
[01:31:51.211 --> 01:31:52.852]  It's called the DailyInformer.net.
[01:31:53.312 --> 01:31:55.654]  I called him beforehand, but it seems like
[01:31:56.224 --> 01:32:01.668]  This particular, like all the dots are connected, none of those are stupid, it's almost like common sense.
[01:32:01.828 --> 01:32:13.597]  We can tell when someone's lying, and it seems so obvious that something, there's something huge that either someone, there's a threat behind the scenes, someone's life, family's at stake, I mean who knows what it is, but
[01:32:14.096 --> 01:32:17.597]  Something's not right, and it's really obvious, and we all can kind of tell.
[01:32:18.018 --> 01:32:31.003]  I think it's very funny that we had Michael Hayden going on different talk shows, the entire circuit, saying, well, if Donald Trump thought he was being wiretapped, he should just call up the director of the FBI, the director of the CIA, the director of the NSA.
[01:32:31.063 --> 01:32:32.003]  Are you listening to me?
[01:32:32.303 --> 01:32:33.964]  And it's like, what are you kidding?
[01:32:34.024 --> 01:32:38.306]  I mean, what a naive group of people he must think the American people are.
[01:32:38.726 --> 01:32:44.128]  We've had James Clapper lie to us about that, and then about a week or two later we see the Snowden documents.
[01:32:44.448 --> 01:32:45.828]  We can't believe anything these people say.
[01:32:45.848 --> 01:32:50.530]  And of course if they're listening to you, they're not going to tell you that they're listening to you.
[01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:54.551]  It's just absolutely beyond belief that they think they can get away with this.
[01:32:54.571 --> 01:32:57.112]  You're talking about people knowing that they're being lied to.
[01:32:57.132 --> 01:33:04.915]  Can you imagine if they had evidence that the Russians had hacked into state boards of elections as we saw Homeland Security do?
[01:33:05.555 --> 01:33:06.675]  Boy, that would be something, wouldn't it?
[01:33:06.695 --> 01:33:10.957]  Of course, they probably would stop the presses for that kind of information.
[01:33:10.977 --> 01:33:22.940]  But it's not a big deal if Obama's Homeland Security does it, or if they want to establish the fact that Homeland Security can get involved in the computers in any of the states and mess with those because of, you know, national security.
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:23.821]  That's not a problem.
[01:33:25.141 --> 01:33:28.242]  Yeah, it seems like the swamp is just so freaking deep.
[01:33:28.762 --> 01:33:35.204]  And as the story unfolds, it's just like, it seems like it's, there's just a bigger hole behind the bigger hole behind the bigger hole.
[01:33:39.777 --> 01:33:40.998]  Absolutely, I totally agree with you.
[01:33:41.038 --> 01:33:44.460]  Let's go to Carlos in Denver.
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:45.201]  Carlos, go ahead.
[01:33:46.802 --> 01:33:48.443]  Yes, thanks for taking my call.
[01:33:51.345 --> 01:34:03.793]  I saw part of the hearing today, this morning, and people forget that the President of the United States is the first magistrate of the land, and as such, he can
[01:34:05.433 --> 01:34:29.965]  Within a short amount of time, after Judge Gorsuch gets confirmed by the Senate, he should fire the head of the FBI and the head of the National Security Agency, in my opinion, for untruthful testimony, sworn testimony, before a committee of Congress.
[01:34:30.595 --> 01:34:31.376]  I absolutely agree.
[01:34:31.476 --> 01:34:39.847]  I think he's trying to be very presidential, very diplomatic, trying to show that he's bigger than all of this stuff, but I think he's in a very dangerous position here.
[01:34:40.588 --> 01:34:47.417]  And I don't know how he would do it with FBI Director Comey, because Comey has come out and said, hey, the FBI director has a tenure.
[01:34:48.498 --> 01:34:50.680]  And I intend to serve that entire 10 years.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.922]  This guy is a political weasel.
[01:34:53.022 --> 01:34:55.324]  He will do whatever he needs to do.
[01:34:55.364 --> 01:34:58.447]  And you have to understand that they can blackmail.
[01:34:58.807 --> 01:35:00.889]  They haven't found anything on Donald Trump, I'm sure.
[01:35:00.949 --> 01:35:02.891]  Because if they had, they would be using it by now.
[01:35:02.931 --> 01:35:04.813]  That's the other thing that I find is very interesting.
[01:35:05.093 --> 01:35:06.194]  The dog that hasn't barked.
[01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:11.598]  The fact that they have examined everything on Donald Trump and you've heard nothing about it, which means the guy is clean.
[01:35:11.978 --> 01:35:13.640]  Because they've examined him one way or the other.
[01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:21.706]  But they do have a lot of stuff to blackmail the rest of the people in Washington to oppose the removal of FBI Director Comey.
[01:35:21.726 --> 01:35:23.427]  So I think that's the real key.
[01:35:23.827 --> 01:35:26.429]  That's the real key, that they can blackmail these other crooked politicians.
[01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:29.051]  Well, you have to look at the personality of the President.
[01:35:29.171 --> 01:35:32.394]  You know, he went to a military academy for high school.
[01:35:32.955 --> 01:35:36.036]  Okay, so he doesn't have a character that's a quitter there.
[01:35:36.256 --> 01:35:38.557]  They teach you leadership and guts, okay?
[01:35:39.637 --> 01:35:42.898]  Number two, he's not a drinker, not a smoker, okay?
[01:35:43.978 --> 01:35:45.258]  He's a normal guy.
[01:35:45.958 --> 01:35:48.599]  He likes ladies, beautiful ladies.
[01:35:48.899 --> 01:35:50.260]  You know, I don't blame him, you know?
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:54.361]  And as such, they haven't found a thing on him.
[01:35:54.901 --> 01:35:55.221]  That's right.
[01:35:55.916 --> 01:35:56.176]  That's right.
[01:35:56.196 --> 01:35:57.117]  You know what?
[01:35:57.137 --> 01:36:03.361]  Yeah, you think about the little minor things that they've thrown out there as bones, thinking they could take him down with, and they were nothing.
[01:36:03.781 --> 01:36:04.622]  They're absolutely nothing.
[01:36:05.002 --> 01:36:16.630]  If they had anything, anything of substance about him financially, or any kind of criminal contacts, or any contacts with the Russians, believe me, they have looked at him, they said, oh, we've been looking at him since last summer, well then,
[01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:19.351]  You haven't found anything in all of this time.
[01:36:19.471 --> 01:36:20.851]  I don't think you're going to find anything.
[01:36:20.891 --> 01:36:24.192]  And if you had, you would be trumpeting it from the tops of the roofs.
[01:36:24.252 --> 01:36:27.614]  And so would CNN, and the Washington Post, and the New York Times, and all these people.
[01:36:27.954 --> 01:36:29.154]  They would use it to take him down.
[01:36:29.174 --> 01:36:30.495]  They don't have anything on him.
[01:36:30.775 --> 01:36:34.496]  They're just trying to smear him and assassinate his character.
[01:36:35.316 --> 01:36:38.917]  And all we hear was, and he is safe.
[01:36:40.398 --> 01:36:43.139]  And I don't know, the answer is, you know, that we can't
[01:36:43.627 --> 01:36:44.949]  Stay, we can do it.
[01:36:45.449 --> 01:36:49.594]  I mean, that's evading responsibility that goes with the job.
[01:36:49.614 --> 01:36:51.276]  I agree.
[01:36:51.316 --> 01:37:01.449]  If they wanted to clear up some of the issues, all they have to say is go behind a close hearing and we can talk about it.
[01:37:02.165 --> 01:37:14.934]  I think the fact that we had Adam Schiff today talking about this BuzzFeed dossier, which was absolutely nothing, that the media, left and right, pro and anti-Trump, resoundingly criticized BuzzFeed for.
[01:37:14.954 --> 01:37:16.495]  They were made a laughingstock of it.
[01:37:16.535 --> 01:37:17.516]  BuzzFeed just dropped it.
[01:37:17.536 --> 01:37:18.917]  They didn't do any more follow-up stories.
[01:37:18.937 --> 01:37:22.439]  They've been sued by one of the Russian tech companies that they named.
[01:37:22.879 --> 01:37:23.580]  They just left that go.
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:28.423]  But the Democrat congressman pulled this up, and James Comey pretends that this is really something.
[01:37:28.443 --> 01:37:29.524]  I mean, this is truly
[01:37:32.095 --> 01:37:34.196]  Truly a coup in the making, what they're trying to do.
[01:37:34.216 --> 01:37:35.276]  And I agree with you, Carlos.
[01:37:35.296 --> 01:37:36.497]  He's got to do something, get them out.
[01:37:37.257 --> 01:37:38.058]  Yeah, get him out.
[01:37:38.338 --> 01:37:39.018]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:39.218 --> 01:37:39.538]  Thank you.
[01:37:39.778 --> 01:37:42.339]  Let's go to Cody in Maryland.
[01:37:42.399 --> 01:37:43.000]  Cody, go ahead.
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:45.461]  Hi, guys.
[01:37:45.481 --> 01:37:45.981]  How you doing?
[01:37:46.241 --> 01:37:47.762]  Doing good.
[01:37:49.102 --> 01:37:54.084]  I watched James Comey today on TV and heard him on the local radio here.
[01:37:54.624 --> 01:37:57.466]  And I'm in Maryland, by the way, one of the bluest states that there is.
[01:37:59.546 --> 01:38:00.747]  And to see a man
[01:38:01.710 --> 01:38:08.274]  Lie to the American people in power is totally infuriating to me.
[01:38:08.874 --> 01:38:10.055]  And I'm only 20 years old.
[01:38:11.255 --> 01:38:12.576]  And I work construction jobs.
[01:38:13.316 --> 01:38:14.437]  And my wife works evenings.
[01:38:14.997 --> 01:38:16.418]  And I take care of my son at noon.
[01:38:19.175 --> 01:38:21.697]  Well, you know, he's the new James Clapper, isn't he?
[01:38:21.717 --> 01:38:27.081]  Remember James Clapper, when he was asked by Ron Wyden, are you spying on the Dragnet, spying on American people?
[01:38:27.101 --> 01:38:27.701]  No, no, no.
[01:38:27.781 --> 01:38:29.943]  And he couldn't even look the senator in the eye.
[01:38:30.443 --> 01:38:32.785]  That is Comey now, isn't it?
[01:38:33.346 --> 01:38:34.086]  Yeah, it is.
[01:38:34.106 --> 01:38:40.191]  I'm only 20, and I actually just got into the Infowars thing about a week ago.
[01:38:41.412 --> 01:38:44.614]  From, actually, a South African that works with me.
[01:38:45.595 --> 01:38:47.316]  You mean the Russians didn't put you up to it?
[01:38:49.833 --> 01:38:52.174]  Which is also completely ridiculous.
[01:38:52.254 --> 01:38:53.094]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:53.455 --> 01:39:00.517]  That they can come out and say, oh, the Russians are giving information to InfoWars and giving information to Breitbart.
[01:39:01.438 --> 01:39:02.398]  Completely ridiculous.
[01:39:02.738 --> 01:39:03.599]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:39:04.219 --> 01:39:04.599]  Absolutely.
[01:39:05.119 --> 01:39:05.660]  That's about it.
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:07.080]  Well, thank you.
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:08.141]  Thank you, Cody.
[01:39:08.201 --> 01:39:10.762]  Let's go to Brad in Louisiana.
[01:39:10.782 --> 01:39:13.263]  I'm going to let Leanne and Owen get in on this.
[01:39:13.643 --> 01:39:15.664]  Brad, your comments to Leanne and Owen.
[01:39:16.764 --> 01:39:17.584]  Good evening, friends.
[01:39:19.349 --> 01:39:44.350]  Listening to much as my other Patriot friends, the same things we were listening to all day, and it reminded me of a time when Winston Churchill had to watch what he said about the Axis powers, and instead of using the word lie, he coined a phrase called terminological inexactitudes.
[01:39:45.422 --> 01:39:52.789]  And that is what it appears to be happening as we go through these discussions.
[01:39:52.849 --> 01:40:04.161]  There's no common ground on vocabulary from four-wire telephone service to fiber optic service, and I believe we need to establish prior to these
[01:40:06.098 --> 01:40:12.242]  Conferences are a common ground on what we're going to discuss.
[01:40:12.302 --> 01:40:21.269]  I mean, infringement is easy enough, but surveillance tends to give the innuendo of observing.
[01:40:21.329 --> 01:40:26.712]  You know, extreme diversion sounds something like a urologist would do it.
[01:40:27.153 --> 01:40:29.394]  You know, redirected personal information.
[01:40:29.694 --> 01:40:34.578]  Something, you know, in order to know that we're talking about the same subject.
[01:40:36.274 --> 01:40:47.540]  And I'm just curious as to where Hillary's transgressions vaporize to, and why Obama is untouchable, and why is Crapper still on the streets?
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:49.381]  What do you guys think?
[01:40:52.011 --> 01:41:09.648]  Well, I mean, just the same comment that you made about Churchill commenting on the powers that be at the time, I think that there's a similar power structure happening now, and Trump doesn't want to step on the wrong toes, he doesn't want to say the wrong thing, and for me, I think more than anything,
[01:41:10.768 --> 01:41:12.449]  He doesn't want to start a civil war.
[01:41:12.469 --> 01:41:18.093]  I mean, if you listen, I mean, we had the caller calling earlier who's saying he's in utter shock.
[01:41:18.113 --> 01:41:20.434]  He's like, how can they just get up here and just lie to us?
[01:41:20.494 --> 01:41:24.357]  How can they say one thing six months ago and then say the exact opposite thing now?
[01:41:24.397 --> 01:41:26.398]  I mean, these are just blatant, bold-faced liars.
[01:41:26.458 --> 01:41:27.839]  I mean, the nerve of these people.
[01:41:28.479 --> 01:41:30.740]  And you've got politicians that go along with it.
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:32.261]  You've got media that goes along with it.
[01:41:32.341 --> 01:41:34.322]  And you've got the minions in the street that go along with it.
[01:41:34.342 --> 01:41:37.844]  You've got Chuckie Schumer saying, get out in the streets, get active.
[01:41:37.864 --> 01:41:39.986]  You've got Maxine Waters saying, we need blood in the streets.
[01:41:40.006 --> 01:41:40.886]  The list goes on and on.
[01:41:41.587 --> 01:41:43.488]  I don't think Trump wants a civil war in his hands.
[01:41:43.628 --> 01:41:45.729]  I don't think Trump wants the blood of a civil war in his hands.
[01:41:45.769 --> 01:41:52.113]  So I think that he's just treading lightly on these people and these circumstances.
[01:41:52.893 --> 01:41:58.099]  In order to try to avoid that and just hope he can get back in office in 2020 and just keep pushing his agenda forward.
[01:41:58.539 --> 01:42:06.087]  So it'll be interesting to see how that plays out considering these politicians that are in his way are just flat-out bold-faced liars.
[01:42:06.348 --> 01:42:08.910]  Right, well perfect example is Brian Williams.
[01:42:09.711 --> 01:42:16.879]  Uh, saying that it's striking to see the White House basically creating an alternative universe being proposed in real time.
[01:42:17.339 --> 01:42:21.203]  He's saying this alternative definitions are being trotted out in real time.
[01:42:21.583 --> 01:42:31.594]  So this is Brian Williams who said that he misremembered, uh, the fact that what was he was in the helicopter that was like shot down with RPG fires.
[01:42:31.614 --> 01:42:32.755]  The original fake news anchor.
[01:42:33.015 --> 01:42:33.755]  I don't think so.
[01:43:02.814 --> 01:43:04.916]  Hey, I just wanted to say that I love your product.
[01:43:32.236 --> 01:43:37.401]  The muscle building supplements especially, me and my wife use them and they're the best.
[01:43:37.541 --> 01:43:39.363]  But, yeah.
[01:43:39.803 --> 01:43:41.044]  Thank you.
[01:43:42.165 --> 01:43:47.811]  Yeah, the rally, it was really amazing to see the American people come together like that against the globalist cucks.
[01:43:47.871 --> 01:43:48.531]  It's amazing.
[01:43:51.539 --> 01:43:52.420]  Did I say Louisiana?
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:53.701]  Yeah, I was in Kentucky, but yeah.
[01:43:54.381 --> 01:43:55.922]  So it was a large crowd there.
[01:43:55.962 --> 01:43:59.545]  Did they have problems with a lot of people left out because of security?
[01:44:00.025 --> 01:44:01.446]  That's what we've seen in the past.
[01:44:01.506 --> 01:44:05.309]  It delayed the last rally that was in Louisiana, right?
[01:44:05.349 --> 01:44:06.149]  The one that we did last year.
[01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:07.410]  There's so many, I lose track of them.
[01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:14.435]  But I think the last rally that we had, it started very late because they had so many people, they couldn't get through security in a timely way.
[01:44:14.455 --> 01:44:16.916]  Did they just go ahead and start this one in Louisville?
[01:44:17.177 --> 01:44:18.918]  And were there people left outside?
[01:44:20.126 --> 01:44:25.430]  It was a little bit late, but no later than you'd expect any concert or anything else like that to be late.
[01:44:25.450 --> 01:44:27.292]  Maybe five, seven minutes late.
[01:44:28.212 --> 01:44:28.653]  That's great.
[01:44:29.273 --> 01:44:29.614]  That's great.
[01:44:29.634 --> 01:44:30.614]  Do you have any questions?
[01:44:30.634 --> 01:44:32.256]  Yeah, and the crowd was very excited.
[01:44:32.956 --> 01:44:33.397]  You could tell.
[01:44:33.457 --> 01:44:34.818]  There was a lot of energy in the crowd.
[01:44:34.838 --> 01:44:38.300]  They're saying that there might have been 20,000 people in that arena.
[01:44:38.420 --> 01:44:39.802]  I mean, is that an accurate number?
[01:44:39.822 --> 01:44:42.984]  It says it could hold about 14,000, so that'd be pretty packed.
[01:44:43.524 --> 01:44:45.086]  And they had the floor that was crowded, too.
[01:44:48.265 --> 01:44:51.167]  It was at least 25,000 and 5,000 of them were giving Nazi salutes.
[01:44:53.849 --> 01:44:54.609]  Oh.
[01:44:54.889 --> 01:44:55.810]  Okay.
[01:44:55.890 --> 01:44:56.250]  Okay.
[01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:58.031]  Alright, well thanks.
[01:44:58.131 --> 01:45:00.633]  I'm sure they had their Russian flags too.
[01:45:00.773 --> 01:45:03.795]  They were speaking Russian and they were reading RT.
[01:45:04.195 --> 01:45:07.017]  Alright, let's go to Eugenia in Canada.
[01:45:07.357 --> 01:45:08.018]  Eugenia, go ahead.
[01:45:09.199 --> 01:45:09.599]  Hello?
[01:45:10.039 --> 01:45:10.339]  Hello.
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:12.020]  Yes, good evening.
[01:45:12.721 --> 01:45:13.081]  Good evening.
[01:45:13.121 --> 01:45:14.242]  My question is...
[01:45:16.050 --> 01:45:19.292]  Why don't somebody do something and shut down CNN?
[01:45:19.632 --> 01:45:21.793]  Because they're causing a lot of problems.
[01:45:22.313 --> 01:45:25.796]  Also, they should fire Comey, because he's a liar.
[01:45:26.616 --> 01:45:28.177]  Well, I would agree with firing Comey.
[01:45:28.357 --> 01:45:34.021]  I would not agree with firing CNN, because I believe in the free market, and we see their ratings and the credibility plunging.
[01:45:34.101 --> 01:45:37.643]  So, I think that we just need to give them enough rope to hang themselves.
[01:45:37.683 --> 01:45:44.447]  It's a very dangerous thing when we set up the government to be the final arbiter of truth, and so I don't want the government
[01:45:44.827 --> 01:45:51.314]  Out there saying that CNN is not true therefore we're going to shut them down because that's a very dangerous thing that can backfire against anyone.
[01:45:51.594 --> 01:45:57.240]  What the American public and the market needs to do is say they're lying and so we're not going to watch them anymore and then that problem will just go away.
[01:45:58.141 --> 01:46:02.542]  Yes, she is right though that they are basically riling up the civil unrest.
[01:46:03.122 --> 01:46:07.144]  I mean again and again they're getting behind putting the Black Lives Matter, Hands Up Don't Shoot.
[01:46:07.184 --> 01:46:12.465]  I mean they've really just been hammering down on trying to rile up the populace, get us divided.
[01:46:12.485 --> 01:46:15.786]  And I agree with the caller, they're creating a lot of problems.
[01:46:18.176 --> 01:46:20.579]  The next thing is Mr. Trump.
[01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:22.221]  I love him to death.
[01:46:22.441 --> 01:46:32.735]  I'm here in Canada and I tell you I sit up all the time just to watch what they're saying and what he's doing and I'm praying for him as well and I just wish that
[01:46:33.459 --> 01:46:38.883]  The people, his supporters over there, would come together and do something to help him.
[01:46:38.943 --> 01:46:45.468]  Because like you're saying, they're trying to overthrow him and they're trying to impeach him and all of that.
[01:46:45.629 --> 01:46:48.451]  We need to come together and do something.
[01:46:48.491 --> 01:46:52.174]  Instead of talking, talking, talking, do something to help him.
[01:46:52.514 --> 01:46:58.619]  Because if something is not done, I don't mean something bad, but something needs to be done in order to help him.
[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:14.927]  Well, you know, when he has these rallies like he did last week and again tonight, and you have 20,000 people show up, that's a pretty significant message to the politicians in Washington.
[01:47:15.487 --> 01:47:24.411]  But we need to also support him in terms of sending letters to Congress and sending letters to these people who really weren't
[01:47:25.799 --> 01:47:28.441]  Pushing back against the lies of Comey hard enough.
[01:47:28.481 --> 01:47:30.022]  We had some pushback from some people.
[01:47:30.342 --> 01:47:37.566]  As Nunes pointed out, he said, hey, tell us, did you have, did you get any evidence of votes being flipped in this state, in this state, in this state by Russians?
[01:47:37.626 --> 01:47:38.887]  Of course, the answer was no.
[01:47:39.367 --> 01:47:40.308]  The answer was absolutely no.
[01:47:40.328 --> 01:47:47.992]  They're not even alleging, even though they're implying that the Russians went in and flipped votes when they say the Russians hacked the election.
[01:47:48.593 --> 01:47:49.433]  That's what they're implying.
[01:47:49.633 --> 01:47:55.197]  And he asked that question, but he should have just finished up there and said, well, then they really weren't hacking anything, were they?
[01:47:55.737 --> 01:47:57.418]  You know, what is it that you're investigating?
[01:47:57.438 --> 01:47:59.740]  And they really need to just ask some more pointed questions.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:08.227]  It was a little bit, I think, too indirect, but it was important to get them on the record saying that they didn't have any evidence whatsoever of actual tampering with vote totals.
[01:48:08.607 --> 01:48:18.515]  So, yeah, I think it's important that people write these congressmen both supporting them when they do the right thing and also telling them, hey, grow a spine and stand up to these people who are lying to the American public.
[01:48:20.928 --> 01:48:28.730]  Did you mention, did they actually say anything in the hearing with this crowd strike where they didn't even access the DNC servers?
[01:48:28.770 --> 01:48:32.451]  The DNC said, no, we don't want you to access our servers.
[01:48:32.791 --> 01:48:35.252]  And the FBI said, well, you know, they wouldn't let us.
[01:48:35.272 --> 01:48:37.152]  So what investigation?
[01:48:37.472 --> 01:48:42.954]  Where would they find the proof if they're not even allowed access to these servers that were allegedly hacked into?
[01:48:43.454 --> 01:48:43.914]  Exactly.
[01:48:44.174 --> 01:48:48.037]  They finally did admit, no, no, we didn't actually have any access to the DNC servers.
[01:48:48.137 --> 01:48:50.698]  So, you know, what are they basing their investigation on?
[01:48:50.998 --> 01:49:01.003]  They're basing their investigation on testimony from a guy who was a former Democrat operative who was working for the DNC as a consultant and totally discredited.
[01:49:01.304 --> 01:49:03.044]  That's the basis for their investigation.
[01:49:03.265 --> 01:49:05.146]  So they don't have any facts there.
[01:49:05.166 --> 01:49:07.447]  But I think it's very key, as we've been saying earlier,
[01:49:08.047 --> 01:49:14.328]  That Comey said, well, no, I can't say without investigating the criminal actions that we know happened.
[01:49:14.368 --> 01:49:17.609]  We know these criminal actions leaking information about Michael Flynn.
[01:49:18.249 --> 01:49:19.650]  He won't say if there's an investigation of that.
[01:49:19.670 --> 01:49:22.350]  He won't say there's an investigation of the Clinton Foundation.
[01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:30.132]  He won't say if there's an investigation of who continues to leak information about Donald Trump designed to make him look bad from the Intelligence Committee.
[01:49:30.412 --> 01:49:33.613]  He won't comment on anything other than this Russian red herring.
[01:49:35.687 --> 01:49:37.368]  Because he needs to speak up.
[01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:42.212]  He cannot just hold back and hold back and he needs to speak up and speak the truth.
[01:49:42.272 --> 01:49:43.853]  So, what can be done?
[01:49:43.873 --> 01:49:55.001]  I mean, I know he's the FBI's, he's in charge of whatever he's in charge of, but is there no other body that can force him to speak the truth and answer their question?
[01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:57.723]  Well, that's a good question.
[01:49:57.783 --> 01:49:59.945]  Do you want to respond, Owen or Leanne?
[01:50:01.526 --> 01:50:02.987]  I kind of didn't understand the end of that.
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:05.521]  Well, who can force him to reveal?
[01:50:05.541 --> 01:50:10.844]  I mean, I'm sure that there are ways, but probably not right there in front of that congressional hearing.
[01:50:10.904 --> 01:50:17.067]  It's just like when they were exposing Operation Mockingbird, he was like, well, I'd like to have that.
[01:50:17.487 --> 01:50:21.329]  I'd like to have that conversation behind closed doors in a smaller forum.
[01:50:21.569 --> 01:50:22.770]  So it might be something like that.
[01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:23.931]  But I'm not sure if there is.
[01:50:24.071 --> 01:50:27.693]  And I'm pretty sure that most of that stuff that came out during the church hearings, they ended up
[01:50:28.453 --> 01:50:28.753]  I don't
[01:50:52.110 --> 01:50:53.232]  And I guess you could have the debate.
[01:50:53.553 --> 01:50:55.217]  He's just not giving any credence to this.
[01:50:55.658 --> 01:50:57.783]  Whether he should or not is the debate, I suppose.
[01:50:57.903 --> 01:51:00.970]  But I think he's focused on the agenda and just putting these people in his rear view.
[01:51:01.522 --> 01:51:03.404]  Yeah, let's hope that works for him.
[01:51:03.664 --> 01:51:05.045]  I hope that does work.
[01:51:05.506 --> 01:51:10.010]  There's a lot of stuff that needs to be done and of course they're going to continue this narrative on the side.
[01:51:10.050 --> 01:51:10.751]  Thank you, Eugenia.
[01:51:10.791 --> 01:51:11.532]  Let's go to Ralph.
[01:51:11.592 --> 01:51:17.257]  David, I just wanted to comment on something you said earlier about the importance of these large crowds coming out for Trump.
[01:51:17.637 --> 01:51:21.281]  Another important point about that is local politicians will notice.
[01:51:22.021 --> 01:51:26.626]  The people in Louisville that will be running in the next upcoming election, trust me,
[01:51:26.966 --> 01:51:34.751]  They're going to see 20,000 strong coming out for Trump, and they're going to want to have their rhetoric and their campaign be a lot like what his was.
[01:51:34.771 --> 01:51:37.713]  I think that that's another thing that we'll see from these rallies being so successful.
[01:51:37.733 --> 01:51:38.193]  Oh, I agree.
[01:51:38.313 --> 01:51:40.134]  All up and down the ballot at the state level.
[01:51:40.214 --> 01:51:45.377]  That's why he points out the governors, lieutenant governors, the senators, the congressmen who were there, even if they're not there.
[01:51:45.798 --> 01:51:51.201]  Because I have covered politics for a long time, and covered it with cameras.
[01:51:51.381 --> 01:51:53.983]  Nobody shows up to these rallies, typically.
[01:51:54.383 --> 01:52:04.547]  I mean, you can have rallies where there are an entire slate of statewide Republican candidates in North Carolina and nobody shows up, basically, except for their staff and the press.
[01:52:05.067 --> 01:52:06.668]  And there's nobody that shows up.
[01:52:06.728 --> 01:52:11.069]  And so, to have the kind of rallies that Donald Trump has had is truly unprecedented.
[01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:18.332]  Obama had a lot of rallies, but Obama also co-headlined with big musical groups that were warm-ups for him.
[01:52:18.732 --> 01:52:22.694]  And it's always, it was always a question to me whether people were coming there to hear the bands or him.
[01:52:23.633 --> 01:52:24.896]  Or just went to a university.
[01:52:25.096 --> 01:52:28.042]  He would go to a university or he'd get prefaced with a musician.
[01:52:28.283 --> 01:52:28.704]  That's right.
[01:52:29.084 --> 01:52:30.527]  So what we're seeing with Donald Trump...
[01:52:31.701 --> 01:52:38.846]  Over and over again, these massive crowds that show up and would listen to him just speak off the cuff for an hour or an hour and a half.
[01:52:38.986 --> 01:52:39.987]  That is unprecedented.
[01:52:40.027 --> 01:52:40.747]  So you're right, Owen.
[01:52:41.087 --> 01:52:46.071]  That is something that is a real message to these politicians there in that state.
[01:52:46.191 --> 01:52:54.416]  But it's also a very important message to the people who are trying to undermine and impeach Donald Trump in Washington and make no doubt about it.
[01:52:54.476 --> 01:52:55.737]  That's precisely what they're trying to do.
[01:52:55.777 --> 01:52:56.878]  Let's go to Ralph.
[01:52:57.358 --> 01:52:58.959]  He says he's on the East Coast.
[01:52:59.059 --> 01:52:59.660]  Ralph, go ahead.
[01:53:00.970 --> 01:53:01.631]  Hey, guys.
[01:53:01.651 --> 01:53:02.772]  How's everybody doing tonight?
[01:53:03.012 --> 01:53:03.372]  Doing good.
[01:53:04.634 --> 01:53:05.334]  All right.
[01:53:05.415 --> 01:53:06.496]  Just a few points here.
[01:53:06.556 --> 01:53:12.482]  So I wanted to briefly discuss with you all Comey's recent appearance.
[01:53:13.743 --> 01:53:15.265]  So I got to agree with you all.
[01:53:15.825 --> 01:53:18.708]  I don't think there's much fire there.
[01:53:19.169 --> 01:53:20.230]  Definitely red herring.
[01:53:20.290 --> 01:53:23.353]  I mean, there's obviously a lot of smoke and a lot of talk about it.
[01:53:24.544 --> 01:53:31.606]  But I've read some really reputable sources on this, and it seems like there's no real fire there.
[01:53:32.346 --> 01:53:33.486]  This is really just a point.
[01:53:33.506 --> 01:53:34.847]  I've got to agree with your last point.
[01:53:34.887 --> 01:53:44.789]  I certainly do think they're moving to impeach Mr. Trump on these grounds, which we'll see if they actually come up with any evidence to support that.
[01:53:44.829 --> 01:53:48.550]  But I know that's where the Democrats are certainly pushing for.
[01:53:49.290 --> 01:53:52.911]  They've been waging a pretty long campaign here against Trump ever since he was elected.
[01:53:53.847 --> 01:53:56.129]  But just a few more points while I got you all on the line.
[01:53:56.209 --> 01:54:08.099]  So I just wanted to get your thoughts on Goldman Sachs' role in the Trump administration and why Trump, if he's fighting the globalists, why he would be bringing in so many of these Goldman Sachs head honchos here.
[01:54:09.349 --> 01:54:10.550]  Well, I'll start with that.
[01:54:10.930 --> 01:54:23.236]  Of course, he's got Steve Mnuchin, who was the treasurer for his campaign, but also the other person that concerns me more than Steve Mnuchin, because Steve Mnuchin, even though he's got a lot of ties to Goldman Sachs, he's left it for quite some time.
[01:54:23.276 --> 01:54:27.639]  Remember, Steve Bannon used to be with Goldman Sachs for a while, and then he left, okay?
[01:54:28.479 --> 01:54:32.322]  And Steve Bannon, I don't think, is a lackey for Goldman Sachs.
[01:54:32.362 --> 01:54:33.503]  But there is a problem.
[01:54:33.563 --> 01:54:43.370]  There is a civil war within the Trump administration on trade, for example, between Bannon and between this other fellow, Gary Cohen.
[01:54:44.751 --> 01:54:46.734]  Uh, in terms of trade.
[01:54:47.295 --> 01:54:51.159]  And there is an open civil war between them as to what they're going to do.
[01:54:51.179 --> 01:55:02.613]  Whether they're going to have a border adjustment tax or do something to try to remove the disincentives for people to manufacture in America and the penalties that are built into our system that
[01:55:03.885 --> 01:55:04.265]  I don't
[01:55:23.724 --> 01:55:29.308]  Remove the taxes at the borders and then put all the taxes on the American people internally in the country.
[01:55:29.368 --> 01:55:34.672]  That's what they did when they restructured the entire tax system at the same time they created the Federal Reserve.
[01:55:34.692 --> 01:55:45.739]  So, Gary Cohen is from that part and there is an open civil war between them that's been reported on by Zero Hedge, by Wall Street Journal and others talking about this open competition.
[01:55:45.759 --> 01:55:46.820]  Big fan of Zero Hedge as well.
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:47.560]  Sorry?
[01:55:48.021 --> 01:55:51.223]  Big fan of Zero Hedge as well and you are on point.
[01:55:51.263 --> 01:55:52.684]  He discusses this a lot as well.
[01:55:53.124 --> 01:55:55.985]  So it's interesting to see how this is going to shake out.
[01:55:56.045 --> 01:56:03.208]  You know, there is this tension going back and forth, and quite frankly, I don't understand why Donald Trump brought in people like that.
[01:56:03.248 --> 01:56:15.953]  I know he wanted to get people that were movers and shakers, but then there's also the issue that if you're going to run a three-legged race with these people, you want to make sure that they agree as to where the goal is and which direction you're running in, and they're not going to be running in the opposite direction.
[01:56:16.213 --> 01:56:21.855]  We've already seen the effects of some of that, so I'm very concerned about how that's going to shake out in the long term.
[01:56:22.395 --> 01:56:31.437]  We'll just have to hope that Donald Trump knows what he's doing, putting some of these people that don't seem to be on board with the agenda that he won the election with.
[01:56:31.958 --> 01:56:33.518]  Leanne Owen, you have any comments about that?
[01:56:33.538 --> 01:56:41.420]  I guess I would just, I just hope that, you know, he's hiring people that he knows they've got kind of the inside scoop on how things operate.
[01:56:42.080 --> 01:56:46.301]  So, you know, he might be able to get a little inside baseball from these people.
[01:56:47.982 --> 01:56:48.622]  What do you think, Owen?
[01:56:49.073 --> 01:56:55.096]  Well, I mean, the way Alex always describes it is you got to bring the people in that know how to fix the equipment or know how the equipment runs.
[01:56:55.316 --> 01:56:55.476]  Right.
[01:56:55.836 --> 01:57:09.282]  And I guess the hope there would be that they know how the equipment runs and now they want to run it in a different way that would be more nationalistic or more fair traded or, you know, not rigging markets in the oil economy or in the banking industry.
[01:57:09.482 --> 01:57:14.984]  Well if you just throw it bottom out, every middle class, everyone, they're not going to take the rise.
[01:57:15.004 --> 01:57:16.264]  Well he did kill TPP.
[01:57:16.364 --> 01:57:26.707]  But, you know, let's keep in mind, this is something that a lot of people would have said, that Trump is always 4, 5, 6, you know, you can't even really put a number to it, moves ahead because he's operating in this 6 dimensional chess game or whatever.
[01:57:27.387 --> 01:57:29.288]  So, he's got all of these battles.
[01:57:29.328 --> 01:57:35.311]  There's all these battles that America, the Americans that voted for Trump, want to be fought.
[01:57:35.771 --> 01:57:37.452]  The spy state, the Fed.
[01:57:37.472 --> 01:57:43.595]  I mean, these are huge battles that perhaps Donald Trump says, you know what, I can't take these battles on right now.
[01:57:43.975 --> 01:57:45.476]  I gotta take on healthcare.
[01:57:45.556 --> 01:57:46.816]  I gotta take on jobs.
[01:57:47.217 --> 01:57:48.557]  And he's focusing on that right now.
[01:57:48.597 --> 01:57:50.018]  Maybe he builds a wall, maybe he doesn't.
[01:57:50.098 --> 01:57:51.439]  I don't know, I really couldn't care less.
[01:57:51.959 --> 01:57:53.740]  But those are the things that he's focusing on.
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:58:06.312]  And so maybe down the road, after he gets elected again, or who knows, after he grooms his son, or whoever it is that replaces him if we continue down this path, to maybe then they can be ready to take on the Fed.
[01:58:06.632 --> 01:58:08.794]  Or they can be ready to take on the surveillance state.
[01:58:09.275 --> 01:58:12.979]  So I think that as far as looking at all these battles and saying, why is he doing this?
[01:58:13.019 --> 01:58:13.940]  Why isn't he doing this?
[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:14.860]  This needs to be done here.
[01:58:15.201 --> 01:58:15.581]  You know what?
[01:58:15.621 --> 01:58:16.482]  He's not perfect.
[01:58:16.602 --> 01:58:17.523]  He's not going to be perfect.
[01:58:18.564 --> 01:58:24.025]  As long as he's trying to move everything in the right direction in the long term, I think that I can get behind it.
[01:58:24.065 --> 01:58:24.905]  But it's still early.
[01:58:24.925 --> 01:58:26.906]  It's still early to see what some of these people are going to do.
[01:58:27.046 --> 01:58:34.887]  Well, it's interesting to see just how, you know, he did sort of speak out about the intelligence agencies and put it out there that he didn't necessarily trust them.
[01:58:35.427 --> 01:58:38.568]  And so we see how that move right there.
[01:58:38.588 --> 01:58:44.669]  There's no way he can really go after the surveillance state after that apparatus because now they are all collectively
[01:58:45.269 --> 01:58:46.310]  We're good to go.
[01:59:07.378 --> 01:59:14.024]  The Deep State's spying, this is a guy who tweets about, you know, wrapping up all the pedophile perverts, and it has him freaked out!
[01:59:14.404 --> 01:59:14.584]  Right.
[01:59:14.604 --> 01:59:15.945]  So, I mean, this is what you're gonna get!
[01:59:15.965 --> 01:59:16.806]  Right.
[01:59:17.286 --> 01:59:29.717]  Absolutely, you know, getting back to your original question, Ralph, you know, you're talking about the different Goldman Sachs people, as I pointed out, I think Steve Bannon has left that camp, I think he is one of these people who knows how they operate, has rejected how they operate, and he's one of these people who can take them down.
[01:59:30.838 --> 01:59:33.841]  Another one is, who's the guy that was appointed?
[01:59:34.082 --> 01:59:36.624]  Maybe you can help me, Leanne and Owen.
[01:59:36.705 --> 01:59:37.165]  Ted Malik.
[01:59:37.265 --> 01:59:40.909]  Ted Malik that has been tipped as the EU ambassador.
[01:59:40.949 --> 01:59:42.611]  He was a guy who was a globalist.
[01:59:42.751 --> 01:59:43.692]  Sherpa, as he points out.
[01:59:43.732 --> 01:59:44.313]  He knows.
[01:59:45.094 --> 01:59:46.034]  What these people are up to.
[01:59:46.295 --> 01:59:48.396]  And he is opposed to the globalist agenda.
[01:59:48.936 --> 01:59:56.259]  So, simply the fact that somebody has gone to Harvard, that they've been employed by Goldman Sachs at some point in their life, doesn't necessarily take them out.
[01:59:56.700 --> 02:00:08.165]  What we were talking about was the article from Zero Hedge about ten days, two weeks ago, where they were talking about one of the people within the Trump administration, I can't remember the gentleman's name, and he wrote an op-ed piece.
[02:00:08.505 --> 02:00:11.667]  And their comment at the time was, wait a minute, why is he putting this out?
[02:00:12.332 --> 02:00:23.946]  Promoting the idea that we've got to do something to fundamentally change our tax structure to stop penalizing exports from the United States and start rewarding people who import into the United States.
[02:00:24.707 --> 02:00:26.730]  And they said, is there some kind of civil war going on?
[02:00:27.918 --> 02:00:28.358]  We're good.
[02:00:47.091 --> 02:00:51.457]  Like I said, one of the things that turned me around initially, I wasn't sure that Trump was real.
[02:00:51.777 --> 02:01:02.030]  I don't typically believe politicians when they tell me certain things, but when I saw that he had been putting out op-ed pieces 30 years ago at his expense in the New York Times talking about
[02:01:02.691 --> 02:01:03.812]  Thanks for your time.
[02:01:03.832 --> 02:01:05.373]  Can I make one more point while I got you all on?
[02:01:29.884 --> 02:01:35.791]  All right, so talking about trade, I know there's been a lot of rumbling about trade with China.
[02:01:36.552 --> 02:01:41.598]  And in my view, from what it appears to me, is that the problem the U.S.
[02:01:41.618 --> 02:01:46.384]  has is more with these multinational corporations.
[02:01:46.864 --> 02:01:47.445]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:02:02.846 --> 02:02:05.227]  So, I just wanted to get your opinion on that.
[02:02:05.267 --> 02:02:08.229]  I know Trump has gone after Carrier and some of these other companies.
[02:02:08.889 --> 02:02:13.611]  I see that Boeing executive was just put up in a high position within the Trump administration.
[02:02:14.252 --> 02:02:23.336]  So, can we look to any further actions taken on reining in the power of these multinational corporations during the Trump administration?
[02:02:23.736 --> 02:02:29.559]  Is this something he's identified that is a problem to our national sovereignty and to the U.S.
[02:02:29.599 --> 02:02:30.739]  being an economic power?
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:31.600]  Can you guys comment?
[02:02:33.482 --> 02:02:37.425]  Well, I don't know what he's going to do about the multinational corporations specifically.
[02:02:37.465 --> 02:02:38.546]  We'll just have to wait and see.
[02:02:38.666 --> 02:02:52.596]  My only concern at this point is when we look at the infrastructure bill, I'm very concerned that multinational corporations, when we talk about private-public partnerships, that multinational corporations are going to wind up owning our infrastructure like we see with toll roads.
[02:02:53.236 --> 02:02:58.780]  They typically come in and pay for the, you know, get the toll roads put in and it's owned by a Spanish company or whatever.
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:02.983]  I don't want to see that happening throughout the United States because if that happens,
[02:03:03.575 --> 02:03:23.368]  We're going to wind up with the same kind of takeover that the TPP would have done, but they will have done it internally in the United States instead of doing it with a multinational, supranational, multilateral organization like TPP would have set up or like we see with the European Union.
[02:03:23.408 --> 02:03:27.791]  Instead of doing it at that level, they would do it at the lowest level in terms of owning our infrastructure.
[02:03:27.811 --> 02:03:33.395]  So that's something we need to be aware of as the American public and we need to make our concerns known to Trump.
[02:03:33.996 --> 02:03:39.786]  In terms of the infrastructure bill that's going on there, but we'll just have to wait and see what he's going to do with multinational corporations.
[02:03:39.826 --> 02:03:42.752]  He hasn't addressed that per se, as far as I know.
[02:03:42.992 --> 02:03:45.417]  Leanne Owen, you have any comments about that?
[02:03:46.206 --> 02:03:51.228]  Well, I don't know if it's... I would guess that Trump probably likes multinational corporations.
[02:03:51.268 --> 02:03:56.230]  I mean, this is a successful business guy who wants to do as much business as possible with as many people as possible.
[02:03:56.810 --> 02:04:06.474]  I think that what he doesn't like is when he sees people rigging markets or rigging currencies or creating legislation or deals that make it unfair.
[02:04:07.115 --> 02:04:09.256]  Not even necessarily for the big rich guy or anything.
[02:04:09.436 --> 02:04:12.437]  He just sees a deal that's not fair and he says, wait a second, who cut this deal?
[02:04:12.917 --> 02:04:15.560]  He comes in and he says, who wrote NAFTA?
[02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:16.581]  Who wrote the TPP?
[02:04:16.601 --> 02:04:17.162]  What is this?
[02:04:17.682 --> 02:04:21.746]  So I don't think Donald Trump necessarily is anti-multinational corporation.
[02:04:21.766 --> 02:04:23.168]  I would guess he probably is pro.
[02:04:23.688 --> 02:04:30.275]  He just wants to see fair deals that benefit all sides that are not rigging it for whoever is making the deal.
[02:04:30.495 --> 02:04:31.275]  Right, exactly.
[02:04:31.375 --> 02:04:38.317]  You have those 600 corporations there writing the TPP, but that's just basically saying we are the only ones who will ever exist.
[02:04:38.397 --> 02:04:45.459]  And we are the ones that will, yeah, and we are the ones that of course wrote this because we know how the markets work and we know how to rig it to make it to our advantage.
[02:04:45.479 --> 02:04:48.519]  In our favor, right, and then override the sovereignty of other countries.
[02:04:48.579 --> 02:04:51.020]  And then the 600,000 small businesses get left out.
[02:04:51.753 --> 02:04:52.734]  Yeah, he understands that.
[02:04:52.794 --> 02:05:00.738]  That's why he's opposed to these multilateral agreements and he wants these agreements, these trade agreements, to be between two countries at a time, the bilateral agreements.
[02:05:01.438 --> 02:05:01.998]  Thank you, Ralph.
[02:05:02.018 --> 02:05:05.300]  Let's go to our last caller here, Eric in New York.
[02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:05.880]  Go ahead, Eric.
[02:05:07.041 --> 02:05:08.302]  Hey, how you doing, guys?
[02:05:08.562 --> 02:05:08.942]  Doing good.
[02:05:09.702 --> 02:05:13.204]  Okay, this is kind of a two-pronged question.
[02:05:13.284 --> 02:05:15.585]  Actually, I'll start off with a rhetorical question.
[02:05:15.926 --> 02:05:16.606]  I have one question.
[02:05:17.526 --> 02:05:21.570]  Who's kind of designated that Russia is a foreign adversary?
[02:05:21.670 --> 02:05:25.294]  Are we lawfully and legally, constitutionally at war with Russia?
[02:05:26.846 --> 02:05:29.688]  Well, I think the people that run our foreign policy are, quite frankly.
[02:05:30.509 --> 02:05:43.999]  They've been involved with Soros in terms of trying to, and not just trying to, but they really did restart the Cold War, created tensions in Ukraine, tensions in Syria, using ISIS and Al-Qaeda as surrogates.
[02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:48.323]  So, yeah, I mean, they have designated Russia and they have created
[02:05:49.163 --> 02:05:50.864]  A new start on the Cold War.
[02:05:50.924 --> 02:05:54.625]  And those are the people like John McCain and Lindsey Graham and Chuck Schumer.
[02:05:54.665 --> 02:05:57.066]  These people who are pushing back against Donald Trump.
[02:05:57.086 --> 02:05:57.647]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:05:58.147 --> 02:06:00.828]  But you know, I think that it goes beyond that, too.
[02:06:00.868 --> 02:06:04.389]  Because let's remember, okay, what did the Bush administration do after 9-11?
[02:06:05.009 --> 02:06:06.590]  You had to find a scapegoat.
[02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:09.851]  So it was easy to scapegoat Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:06:09.891 --> 02:06:11.272]  Okay, you scapegoat the Middle East.
[02:06:11.292 --> 02:06:12.913]  We go to a never-ending war in the Middle East.
[02:06:12.993 --> 02:06:14.293]  Okay, we're still involved in this war.
[02:06:14.793 --> 02:06:15.894]  So now here we are.
[02:06:16.474 --> 02:06:18.196]  They can't blame Afghanistan.
[02:06:18.216 --> 02:06:20.457]  They can't scapegoat Iraq or Iran or the Middle East.
[02:06:20.477 --> 02:06:22.619]  They can't do that because now they're on their side, see?
[02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:27.924]  Now they have to accept these people and be tolerant of these people because of their open border and refugee policies.
[02:06:28.224 --> 02:06:29.345]  So they can't scapegoat them.
[02:06:29.785 --> 02:06:31.166]  They can't scapegoat the Chinese.
[02:06:31.186 --> 02:06:32.528]  They're not going to put up with it.
[02:06:32.548 --> 02:06:34.489]  They're already cutting deals with the Communist Chinese.
[02:06:34.509 --> 02:06:35.570]  So who do you scapegoat?
[02:06:36.051 --> 02:06:36.791]  Russia!
[02:06:37.272 --> 02:06:38.052]  That's all it is.
[02:06:38.132 --> 02:06:40.034]  It's just the easiest scapegoat for them.
[02:06:40.114 --> 02:06:51.441]  Right, I mean it's interesting just with this, the travel ban, that's not really a ban, that they list all these terror nations and those that are actively a threat to the United States, and Russia's not on that list.
[02:06:52.041 --> 02:06:53.302]  And hasn't been for some time.
[02:06:53.362 --> 02:06:54.462]  Well, look at the Cold War.
[02:06:54.482 --> 02:06:56.744]  They pointed out the Cold War ended.
[02:06:57.344 --> 02:07:11.821]  They gave us the War on Terror, that gave them a profit center, but it was not as profitable for the military-industrial complex as it had been when they had the intercontinental ballistic missiles and bombers and the giant navy and so forth, so it was necessary for the people
[02:07:12.361 --> 02:07:19.327]  Who represent the military-industrial complex to start the Cold War again, so that we could get those big budget projects there.
[02:07:19.367 --> 02:07:28.194]  So now we've got the war on terror plus the Cold War, and the military-industrial complex couldn't be happier in terms of the amount of money that they're going to make off all this stuff.
[02:07:28.675 --> 02:07:40.004]  But the downside to all this is that they've set up all these tripwires and triggers, just like we see they try to add the little country of Montenegro to NATO, and Rand Paul pushed back against McCain and said,
[02:07:41.585 --> 02:07:46.408]  We don't need somebody else who we're going to have another tripwire to bring us into World War III.
[02:07:46.508 --> 02:07:49.831]  These people can't pay for their defense and we're bankrupt.
[02:07:49.911 --> 02:07:54.234]  We need to start getting rid of this massive debt that we have in the United States.
[02:07:54.294 --> 02:07:57.596]  And for that, John McCain said, you're with Vladimir Putin.
[02:07:57.636 --> 02:08:00.118]  I think that's when this whole narrative jumped the shark.
[02:08:00.518 --> 02:08:12.698]  And I think the American people understand this whole, Russia did it, Russia's coal war, this is all a lie, it's a manipulation for the part of the military-industrial complex and the people who front for them, like John McCain.
[02:08:15.592 --> 02:08:16.672]  Okay, am I there?
[02:08:16.932 --> 02:08:17.452]  Yes, you're there.
[02:08:17.492 --> 02:08:18.273]  Go ahead, your comments, sir.
[02:08:18.293 --> 02:08:18.973]  Okay, that was good.
[02:08:19.373 --> 02:08:26.214]  No, I mean, it's interesting because, you know, I just came back from living in China for 12 years solid as a self-imposed exile.
[02:08:26.314 --> 02:08:33.756]  Unlike the left that said, I'm going to leave the country, I actually left under Bush and Obama and just came back the end of last year.
[02:08:33.776 --> 02:08:38.557]  So, yes, I actually left the country as a self-imposed exile.
[02:08:38.597 --> 02:08:42.638]  But regardless of that... So did you leave for political reasons and did you come back for political reasons?
[02:08:43.318 --> 02:08:44.538]  Yes, actually, yes.
[02:08:45.140 --> 02:08:45.340]  Okay.
[02:09:00.938 --> 02:09:02.220]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:07.284]  Were you concerned about the Patriot Act and surveillance state and all that sort of thing?
[02:09:07.304 --> 02:09:13.930]  Yeah, I mean, I have a bit of history with the FBI and Secret Service and stuff under Bush.
[02:09:14.411 --> 02:09:17.634]  I left under Bush because, yeah, anyway.
[02:09:18.094 --> 02:09:19.075]  Now, here's one thing.
[02:09:19.115 --> 02:09:23.139]  I mean, a lot of your callers were saying that, you know, I'm not even going to call them by their names.
[02:09:23.239 --> 02:09:26.022]  I'm going to call them Brand NSA and Brand FBI.
[02:09:28.419 --> 02:09:28.660]  Okay.
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:28.800]  Yeah.
[02:09:41.644 --> 02:09:45.326]  With their quote-unquote surveillance and they always stuck with the term U.S.
[02:09:45.646 --> 02:09:46.086]  person.
[02:09:46.386 --> 02:09:46.627]  Yes.
[02:09:47.307 --> 02:09:49.228]  That's a legal thing that they do.
[02:09:49.448 --> 02:09:51.789]  Exactly, but Trey Gowdy... It's lawyer talk.
[02:09:52.229 --> 02:09:54.190]  Exactly, but so they didn't lie actually.
[02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:56.572]  Yeah, because it could mean anything.
[02:09:57.192 --> 02:09:57.412]  U.S.
[02:09:57.452 --> 02:09:59.133]  person could mean a business.
[02:09:59.153 --> 02:10:00.013]  It could mean a ship.
[02:10:00.714 --> 02:10:03.055]  It could mean anything.
[02:10:03.095 --> 02:10:05.416]  A person is somebody of interest, okay?
[02:10:05.996 --> 02:10:07.637]  But Trey Gowdy was trying to
[02:10:10.538 --> 02:10:10.758]  I don't
[02:10:28.010 --> 02:10:28.830]  It's very different.
[02:10:29.091 --> 02:10:32.452]  So, I mean, I hate to say it, but the FBI and NSA did not lie.
[02:10:32.492 --> 02:10:33.292]  They stuck with U.S.
[02:10:33.352 --> 02:10:35.053]  person, a person of interest.
[02:10:35.573 --> 02:10:35.774]  Yes.
[02:10:36.214 --> 02:10:45.798]  And we know Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA, former director of the CIA, has said, we are, we don't, we're not interested in bad persons.
[02:10:46.378 --> 02:10:48.759]  We're interested in interesting persons.
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:49.620]  Okay?
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:54.283]  So that's another part of it that's very sinister, very troubling.
[02:10:54.763 --> 02:11:05.169]  Not only the person's aspect of it, but the fact that if they just take an interest in you because you're running for president or you won the election as president, then they feel like they've got carte blanche to do whatever they wish to you.
[02:11:06.441 --> 02:11:08.562]  Yeah, I mean, that's the way I saw it.
[02:11:08.622 --> 02:11:18.165]  I mean, they kept using person, and in legal sense, in legalese, I have to say, from my knowledge, from my perspective, they did not lie.
[02:11:19.706 --> 02:11:22.087]  Oh yeah, they know how to prevaricate around the bush, don't they?
[02:11:23.367 --> 02:11:35.192]  Yes, and you know, Trey Gowdy, I mean, I like the guy, and I think he should be, you know, somebody that, I mean, the guy's smart, and I think he actually cares, but I think he's caught in a trap with this legalese that's evolved over
[02:11:37.729 --> 02:11:50.276]  Yeah, I actually remember when Gowdy was speaking today, and he was actually getting very frustrated because he was struggling to defeat them in the battle of legalese, which is something that he's usually really good with.
[02:11:50.317 --> 02:11:59.201]  He's usually really good at trapping whoever he's talking to, and in this occasion he seemed to be very frustrated because they did keep trapping him.
[02:11:59.302 --> 02:12:01.483]  I have to actually agree with the caller, I noticed that too.
[02:12:01.983 --> 02:12:02.884]  That's a very good comment.
[02:12:02.904 --> 02:12:10.172]  Thank you Eric in New York and of course we know that these people are, in the terms of Bohemian Grove, weaving spiders, aren't they?
[02:12:10.192 --> 02:12:18.881]  I thought these people weave a very complicated web and they try to track you by the web that DARPA created, the internet, but of course
[02:12:19.161 --> 02:12:21.502]  There's other ways that we can use that technology.
[02:12:21.562 --> 02:12:27.723]  That's one of the few things that gives me hope when we look forward to some of the horrific things that are on the horizon.
[02:12:27.743 --> 02:12:33.404]  The autonomous killing robots, the robocops that they're talking about putting in everywhere, having us policed by machine.
[02:12:34.044 --> 02:12:46.887]  Still, there's this glimmer of hope that we can take this technology that they created to dominate us and that we can grab a hold of it and turn it around as an instrument of liberation that always remains there.
[02:12:47.403 --> 02:12:49.964]  Well, I think we've reached the end of our broadcast tonight.
[02:12:50.084 --> 02:12:53.826]  Is there anything else that you'd like to say, Owen or Leanne, before we sign off?
[02:12:54.446 --> 02:12:58.969]  I'd like to just add one thing about this whole Russian thing, the whole hearing that went on today.
[02:12:59.029 --> 02:13:02.530]  It lasted, I think, like four hours, the Russian hearing, maybe five.
[02:13:02.610 --> 02:13:03.811]  It felt like it went on forever.
[02:13:03.871 --> 02:13:05.452]  I was trying to monitor it as best I could.
[02:13:06.468 --> 02:13:15.135]  And I think that this is the biggest double standard that, well you know that the Democrat politicians are just shills, they don't care, they look in the mirror and somehow live with themselves every day.
[02:13:15.576 --> 02:13:28.406]  But to the general population out there that still doesn't understand what's going on, that still can't get behind Trump, but not even about Trump, still can't find out who the true liars and frauds and deceivers in politics are, just think about this.
[02:13:29.267 --> 02:13:45.695]  If the Democrats or the left or the liberals, whatever you want to call them, if they really cared about healthcare that they're freaking out about, if they really cared about education that they're freaking out about with Betsy DeVos, why are they spending so much time on this Russian witch hunt?
[02:13:46.095 --> 02:13:49.637]  Why are they spending so much energy on this Russian witch hunt?
[02:13:50.157 --> 02:13:52.699]  So much of their focus is on Russia, Russia, Russia.
[02:13:52.779 --> 02:13:54.059]  They haven't found anything.
[02:13:54.500 --> 02:13:57.702]  And then every once in a while, they're going to spin their heads and yell, my health care!
[02:13:57.942 --> 02:13:58.962]  Spin their head around again.
[02:13:59.703 --> 02:14:01.384]  You know, and it's just like, well, wait a second.
[02:14:01.404 --> 02:14:02.485]  My schools, my health care.
[02:14:02.505 --> 02:14:03.005]  Well, wait a second.
[02:14:03.025 --> 02:14:08.828]  Why don't you quit focusing on Russia and actually pay some attention to the schools and to the health care?
[02:14:08.908 --> 02:14:10.089]  And let's actually work on that.
[02:14:10.129 --> 02:14:11.110]  Let's get something done.
[02:14:11.610 --> 02:14:17.914]  No, they just want to stall on everything in education, stall on everything in health care, and sit here and cry Russia all day.
[02:14:18.434 --> 02:14:20.855]  And again, the Democrats know exactly who they are.
[02:14:20.915 --> 02:14:22.355]  The Chuck Schumer's, Nancy Pelosi's.
[02:14:22.375 --> 02:14:24.916]  Well, I don't know if Nancy Pelosi knows what planet she's on anymore.
[02:14:25.276 --> 02:14:27.737]  But these people look in the mirror and they live with themselves every day.
[02:14:27.777 --> 02:14:34.579]  But the general population who is still backing this fake Russia narrative needs to look at themselves in the mirror and say, you know what?
[02:14:34.940 --> 02:14:41.942]  I'm a total hypocrite because I cry about healthcare in school all day, but I'm staring Russia right in the face without any reason.
[02:14:42.242 --> 02:14:42.702]  No proof.
[02:14:42.742 --> 02:14:53.706]  Well, obviously, too, that's to divert attention to all the stories that are coming out saying what a disgrace, a debacle the healthcare is, the school, the education system, that they really played a hand in.
[02:14:53.726 --> 02:14:54.666]  That they built, exactly.
[02:14:54.686 --> 02:14:55.767]  That they built, exactly.
[02:14:55.787 --> 02:14:58.828]  So they want to put the attention on the non-story of Russia.
[02:14:59.048 --> 02:14:59.588]  It's Trump's fault.
[02:14:59.608 --> 02:15:00.168]  It's Trump's fault.
[02:15:00.649 --> 02:15:01.569]  Russia's agents here.
[02:15:01.829 --> 02:15:17.832]  And of course, speaking to your point that you just made, when they want to talk about the fact that we are threatened by Russia, that they want to pretend that we're not threatened by Al-Qaeda, by ISIS, that these nations that Barack Obama went to war with, we shouldn't worry about anybody coming from there without any vetting.
[02:15:17.952 --> 02:15:26.534]  So, they're dangerous enough that we need to go to war against them, we need to bomb them, we need to send troops there, but then we don't have to worry about any of those people who would come into our country.
[02:15:27.034 --> 02:15:30.316]  That's the kind of double think that you have to embrace for the Democrats.
[02:15:30.336 --> 02:15:32.877]  But of course, they're broadening out this entire attack.
[02:15:33.217 --> 02:15:34.237]  It's not just Donald Trump.
[02:15:34.577 --> 02:15:36.858]  It's going to be the media, everybody who is with him.
[02:15:37.179 --> 02:15:39.740]  The entire movement has to be discredited.
[02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:42.241]  And that's what we see evolving.
[02:15:42.961 --> 02:15:47.783]  And we're going to be talking about that tomorrow on the Alex Jones Show at 11 Central, Noon Eastern Time.
[02:15:47.823 --> 02:15:48.744]  So join us then.
[02:15:48.964 --> 02:15:54.187]  Alex will be back live on radio tomorrow at 11 and Noon Eastern Time.
[02:15:54.307 --> 02:15:55.387]  Thank you for joining us tonight.
[02:15:55.427 --> 02:16:00.310]  That's the end of our nightly news and we'll be back with the nightly news tomorrow night at 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[02:16:00.430 --> 02:16:00.690]  Eastern.
[02:16:11.820 --> 02:16:14.042]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[02:16:14.422 --> 02:16:26.671]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[02:16:26.691 --> 02:16:34.336]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies, you can look them up yourself, that show
[02:16:35.277 --> 02:16:43.659]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[02:16:43.799 --> 02:16:50.081]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[02:16:50.981 --> 02:16:52.862]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[02:16:53.882 --> 02:16:55.143]  People are falling apart.
[02:16:55.183 --> 02:16:56.203]  They're totally depressed.
[02:16:56.223 --> 02:16:56.763]  They're not happy.
[02:16:57.363 --> 02:16:58.363]  What is going on?
[02:16:59.644 --> 02:17:03.585]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[02:17:04.844 --> 02:17:07.485]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[02:17:07.865 --> 02:17:09.606]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:17:09.826 --> 02:17:16.989]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:17:17.209 --> 02:17:25.693]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[02:17:27.133 --> 02:17:33.796]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[02:17:34.156 --> 02:17:37.638]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:17:37.698 --> 02:17:40.879]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[02:17:41.499 --> 02:17:46.682]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:17:47.222 --> 02:17:50.423]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:17:50.743 --> 02:18:01.386]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[02:18:01.486 --> 02:18:02.986]  The bone is so amazing.
[02:18:03.386 --> 02:18:09.108]  From the outside structure full of minerals and keto factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[02:18:10.253 --> 02:18:13.234]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[02:18:13.774 --> 02:18:19.317]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[02:18:19.617 --> 02:18:29.281]  High-quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[02:18:29.561 --> 02:18:34.223]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[02:18:34.443 --> 02:18:36.264]  This is a absolute win-win.
[02:18:36.344 --> 02:18:39.164]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
