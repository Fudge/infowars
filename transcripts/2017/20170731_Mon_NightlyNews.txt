[00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.613]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:22.233]  It's Monday, July 31st, 2017.
[00:00:23.474 --> 00:00:24.554]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:24.814 --> 00:00:25.915]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:29.616 --> 00:00:35.558]  Tonight, Anthony Scaramucci is out as the White House Communications Director.
[00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:45.502]  Then, a legal process has been initiated for a five-year moratorium on childhood vaccines, and you can take action now.
[00:00:46.923 --> 00:00:49.544]  To make your voice heard to a sympathetic president.
[00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:57.629]  Then... The BLM's censorship with a First Amendment area enraged the nation at the Bundy Ranch.
[00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.831]  But the censorship rules of the judge and the trial are far worse.
[00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:05.293]  Get a live report from the trial.
[00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:06.514]  And...
[00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:15.340]  We talked to a contestant in the $20,000 Folk Song Cover Contest that will be ending this week.
[00:01:19.523 --> 00:01:22.285]  All that and more on tonight's InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.492 --> 00:01:35.355]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:47.404]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community is fully aware of the fact
[00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:53.667]  That our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:01:54.387 --> 00:02:02.310]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:11.815]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:18.804]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:27.317]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:32.041]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body.
[00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:34.904]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:43.532]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:49.657]  Because of you praying for the broadcast, because of you buying the products and financially supporting the transmissions.
[00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:55.582]  So please, secure your caveman today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:15.412]  Survivor White House edition is what it's been dubbed and the latest one to be ousted in the White House shakeups is Anthony Scaramucci.
[00:03:16.013 --> 00:03:24.424]  Ten days in and he's out and this apparently came at the will of the new White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.
[00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:30.226]  And it's being reported that he was escorted from the grounds.
[00:03:30.326 --> 00:03:38.227]  CBS says he was escorted from the grounds, which is interesting considering that Sean Spicer is finishing out August.
[00:03:38.287 --> 00:03:45.209]  He's still around while Scaramucci gets the quick boot and apparently the ouster from the White House grounds.
[00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.569]  But it's interesting, the constant shake-ups.
[00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:51.250]  Scaramucci, who gets in, gets Priebus out.
[00:03:52.346 --> 00:03:57.669]  Well, first of all, I think Anthony Scaramucci rendered very valuable service to the Trump administration by ridding them of
[00:04:14.515 --> 00:04:35.582]  We've now learned that Priebus was responsible for the appointment of Rod Rosenstein, the number two man at the Justice Department who gave us Robert Mueller as a Lord High Executioner.
[00:04:36.358 --> 00:04:44.144]  Believe me, has his sights set on taking down Donald Trump based on whatever crumped up charges he has to manufacture.
[00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:59.615]  Even more incredibly, we now know that Priebus forced the appointment of Rosenstein on the recommendation of Congressman Elijah Cummings, a certified Trump hater from Baltimore, Maryland.
[00:05:00.544 --> 00:05:03.565]  This is how the two-party duopoly works, Rob.
[00:05:03.585 --> 00:05:05.585]  This is how they help each other.
[00:05:05.645 --> 00:05:14.667]  Now, it is my understanding that Scaramucci is not leaving the administration, but is going to go to the import-export bank to work for the president.
[00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:23.349]  And I doubt that he's going to lose the cell phone number or the numbers at the private residence, and suspect even more.
[00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:25.900]  I'm Anthony Scaramucci.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.642]  I don't think he is done by any means.
[00:05:29.302 --> 00:05:38.728]  But I would also predict to you that he was taken out by a combination of General Kelly working with Steve Bannon.
[00:05:39.688 --> 00:05:41.189]  The bloodletting's not over yet.
[00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.551]  This is very much like the French Revolution.
[00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:46.232]  What do you see who gets their head chopped off next?
[00:05:47.593 --> 00:05:51.916]  This is really, I think, not serving the president well at this point.
[00:05:52.785 --> 00:06:02.636]  But as long as Kelly sticks to his knitting and he views himself as an implementer, someone who carries out Donald Trump's orders, I think he's going to do very well.
[00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:11.105]  He starts imposing his own opinion, for example, on the war on drugs, which is categorically the direct opposite of what Donald Trump
[00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:12.922]  We're good to go.
[00:06:32.202 --> 00:06:41.705]  What I've really found out is that when I went out on the street this morning in Pasadena, California, the first 10 people I asked about Anthony Scaramucci, they had no idea who that was.
[00:06:42.586 --> 00:06:44.787]  When I asked them about Steve Bannon, they never heard of him.
[00:06:45.627 --> 00:06:51.589]  When I asked about General Jack Kelly, they thought he was a World War II hero who was long deceased.
[00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.611]  So, while we pore over this stuff, I'm really not sure.
[00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:58.352]  In fact, I am sure.
[00:06:58.512 --> 00:07:00.013]  The voters don't care.
[00:07:00.093 --> 00:07:10.618]  They care about whether the president keeps the faith on trade, on building the wall, on a better immigration system, and revitalizing the economy, and I'm losing.
[00:07:11.318 --> 00:07:12.459]  Donald Trump's still getting an A+.
[00:07:14.264 --> 00:07:20.812]  The inside baseball from Roger Stone, who knows what's going on, always has the correct forecast.
[00:07:21.292 --> 00:07:25.437]  Now, let's look at what's going on with the Hill right now, as they're about to take a recess.
[00:07:25.537 --> 00:07:28.100]  A well-deserved recess, our hard-working politicians.
[00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:34.168]  Well, Rand Paul actually is one, and he has now blocked NDAA over indefinite detention.
[00:07:34.568 --> 00:07:48.096]  Senator Rand Paul has blocked a motion by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to advance the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, the massive military spending bill, amongst other things, saying the bill should instead face debate and possible amendments.
[00:07:48.516 --> 00:08:00.324]  The bill is set back at least six weeks because of Rand Paul, and again, particularly he is against the indefinite detention of suspects and the use of military force
[00:08:01.516 --> 00:08:12.899]  Now, shocker, I know, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain was critical of this delay and he thinks this bill needs to be passed without delay.
[00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:14.839]  Immediately, John McCain says.
[00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:18.940]  Shocker that John McCain wants to spend more on military.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.121]  Shocker that John McCain goes against the Constitutionalist Rand Paul.
[00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:26.682]  I know, we're all shocked by John McCain being a swamp creature.
[00:08:26.762 --> 00:08:27.162]  Shocking.
[00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.515]  Now here's an interesting development.
[00:08:29.695 --> 00:08:34.698]  Former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio found guilty of criminal contempt of court.
[00:08:34.778 --> 00:08:35.659]  So here's the deal.
[00:08:36.739 --> 00:08:42.183]  Some liberal judge doesn't like the fact that Sheriff Joe is going after illegal immigrants.
[00:08:42.743 --> 00:08:46.285]  The court says, you're not allowed to go after them.
[00:08:46.345 --> 00:08:47.746]  You're prosecuting Latinos.
[00:08:48.126 --> 00:08:49.627]  Well, he believes he had just cause.
[00:08:49.647 --> 00:08:50.688]  He went about it anyway.
[00:08:51.228 --> 00:08:55.151]  And he does plan on appealing the court for a jury.
[00:08:56.892 --> 00:09:02.957]  And again, this is Sheriff Joe who got the independent forensics on Barack Obama's fake birth certificate.
[00:09:03.317 --> 00:09:06.560]  But you read more into this story, and then it all makes sense.
[00:09:07.361 --> 00:09:09.963]  The ACLU is behind it again.
[00:09:10.643 --> 00:09:11.124]  Shocker!
[00:09:11.224 --> 00:09:12.044]  Another shocker!
[00:09:12.325 --> 00:09:13.766]  John McCain, a member of the Swamp.
[00:09:14.066 --> 00:09:16.848]  The ACLU targeting Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
[00:09:17.049 --> 00:09:19.731]  I mean, folks, you would have never seen any of this coming.
[00:09:20.848 --> 00:09:21.989]  Here's what we need.
[00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.292]  This is what this country desperately needs.
[00:09:25.513 --> 00:09:27.935]  This is some justice that is long overdue.
[00:09:28.456 --> 00:09:32.560]  House Judiciary asks for new special counsel for Clinton, Comey, and Lynch.
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:43.410]  Now I'm going to go through the 14 bullet points exactly for you to know because that's how important I think this is for the American people to know and for justice to be served.
[00:09:44.119 --> 00:09:51.108]  Number one, then Attorney General Loretta Lynch directing Mr. Comey to mislead the American people on the nature of the Clinton investigation.
[00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:54.313]  Well, or the fact that Loretta Lynch called it a matter.
[00:09:54.413 --> 00:09:55.334]  So what's up with that?
[00:09:55.534 --> 00:09:56.155]  A matter?
[00:09:56.275 --> 00:09:58.939]  Since when does the FBI get into matters, Loretta Lynch?
[00:09:59.259 --> 00:10:05.820]  Number two, the shadow cast over our system of justice concerning Secretary Clinton and her involvement in mishandling classified information.
[00:10:05.861 --> 00:10:18.463]  That's right, all of the emails she had, the private server, the fact she deleted it, the fact the DNC and other members of the Democrat Party were hacked, the fact the Awan brothers were working for them, they got arrested, that all bars investigation.
[00:10:19.023 --> 00:10:25.665]  Number three, FBI and DOJ's investigative decisions related to the former Secretary Clinton's email investigation.
[00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:35.294]  Including the property and consequence of immunity deals given to potential Clinton co-conspirators Cheryl Mills, Heather Samuelson, John Benton, and possibly others.
[00:10:35.794 --> 00:10:43.502]  Yeah, or the fact that the FBI and the DOJ failed to indict Hillary Clinton, failed to enforce the law.
[00:10:43.802 --> 00:10:44.783]  That's the true question.
[00:10:45.183 --> 00:10:52.985]  Number four, the apparent failure of DOJ to impanel a grand jury to investigate allegations of mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her associates.
[00:10:53.345 --> 00:10:53.845]  Bingo!
[00:10:54.105 --> 00:11:01.547]  Number five, the Department of State and its employees' involvement in determining which communications of Secretary Clinton's and her associates to turn over for public scrutiny.
[00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:06.409]  I mean, her files were so easily accessed, but we're all freaking out over the Russians and Trump.
[00:11:06.809 --> 00:11:11.990]  Number six, WikiLeaks disclosures concerning the Clinton Foundation and its potentially unlawful international dealings.
[00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.810]  Exactly!
[00:11:13.091 --> 00:11:17.774]  Can we finally recognize the content of these emails and do an investigation?
[00:11:18.114 --> 00:11:20.796]  What the hell is a pizza-related map?
[00:11:21.917 --> 00:11:22.317]  Excuse me.
[00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.031]  Number seven.
[00:11:25.131 --> 00:11:30.234]  Connections between the Clinton campaign or the Clinton Foundation and foreign entities, including those from Russia and Ukraine.
[00:11:30.594 --> 00:11:31.875]  Oh, again, finally!
[00:11:32.176 --> 00:11:33.096]  The Russia story!
[00:11:33.256 --> 00:11:36.358]  Finally we can direct it at the Clintons, where we know that there are connections.
[00:11:36.539 --> 00:11:37.379]  And there's paper trails.
[00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:38.100]  Number eight.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:45.545]  Mr. Comey's acknowledge of the purchase of Uranium One by the company Rosatom, whether the approval of the sale was connected to any donations made to the Clinton Foundation,
[00:11:45.945 --> 00:11:47.707]  Or how about Bill Clinton's half a million dollar speech?
[00:11:48.007 --> 00:11:52.712]  And what role Secretary Clinton played in the approval of that sale that had national security ramifications?
[00:11:52.732 --> 00:11:56.596]  Yeah, let's get the talking points and the scope on that, please.
[00:11:56.917 --> 00:11:57.317]  Thank you.
[00:11:57.377 --> 00:11:57.958]  Number nine.
[00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:06.107]  Disclosures arising from the awful access of the DNC computer systems, including inappropriate collusion between DNC, Clinton campaign,
[00:12:06.607 --> 00:12:08.868]  To undermine Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign.
[00:12:08.888 --> 00:12:16.189]  That's right, they colluded with the media, and they probably colluded with Bernie Sanders, to be honest, and the DNC fraud lawsuit is still ongoing.
[00:12:16.229 --> 00:12:17.290]  The mainstream media won't touch it.
[00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:17.690]  Number 10.
[00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:31.053]  Post-election accusations by the president that he was wiretapped by the previous administration, and whether Comey and Lynch had any knowledge of the efforts made by federal agency to unlawfully monitor communications and then candidate Trump for his associates.
[00:12:31.373 --> 00:12:32.674]  We caught them red-handed there, folks.
[00:12:32.694 --> 00:12:33.914]  They are scared to death.
[00:12:34.494 --> 00:12:34.894]  I don't
[00:12:55.714 --> 00:12:56.074]  That's right.
[00:12:56.095 --> 00:12:57.817]  Comey, Lynch, Rice, and Power.
[00:12:57.837 --> 00:12:59.018]  That's who needs to be investigated.
[00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:28.378]  Daniel Richman regarding conversations between Mr. Comey and President Trump, how the leaked information was purposely released to lead to the appointment of a special counsel and whether any classified information was included in the now infamous Comey memos.
[00:13:29.758 --> 00:13:38.703]  And it's also worth noting that if you look at the timeline of Trump's tweets, his testimony under oath and his story,
[00:13:39.867 --> 00:13:41.768]  About the tweets, it really doesn't add up.
[00:13:42.168 --> 00:13:56.973]  Number 13, Mr. Comey and the FBI's apparent reliance on Fusion GPS, which is now being investigated independently as well, in its investigation of the Trump campaign, including the company's creation of a fake dossier of information about Mr. Trump, and everybody knew it was fake and they still passed it around.
[00:13:57.033 --> 00:14:01.615]  Yeah, let's get investigation into GPS, Fusion GPS, and who is working with them.
[00:14:02.215 --> 00:14:04.556]  That investigation is ongoing as well.
[00:14:04.576 --> 00:14:07.337]  14, any and all potential leaks originated by Mr. Comey
[00:14:07.997 --> 00:14:17.162]  And provide to author Michael Schmidt, dating back to 1993, this letter has been signed by all 20 Republican members of the committee.
[00:14:17.202 --> 00:14:19.463]  I bet the Democrats want nothing to do with that, though.
[00:14:20.023 --> 00:14:20.803]  No, no, no.
[00:14:20.883 --> 00:14:23.725]  Not the colluding Democrat scum!
[00:14:24.685 --> 00:14:25.265]  So there you go.
[00:14:25.285 --> 00:14:26.766]  That'd be a nice investigation to start.
[00:14:26.786 --> 00:14:30.426]  14 points right there for us to start at.
[00:14:30.486 --> 00:14:32.447]  I'd like to get the mainstream media behind this.
[00:14:33.047 --> 00:14:34.747]  I'd like to get the American people behind this.
[00:14:34.867 --> 00:14:40.289]  I'd like to get the Attorney General behind this, the Department of Justice behind this, the Supreme Court.
[00:14:40.489 --> 00:14:41.829]  Everyone needs to be behind this.
[00:14:42.129 --> 00:14:43.310]  We spent all this time on Russia.
[00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:44.690]  It's produced diddly.
[00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.291]  It's time to get into something that might actually produce.
[00:14:48.112 --> 00:14:49.192]  How about Facebook, folks?
[00:14:49.232 --> 00:14:51.654]  This is, I mean, you want to talk about 1984.
[00:14:52.274 --> 00:14:52.974]  Saving face.
[00:14:53.154 --> 00:14:55.176]  Facebook wants access without limits.
[00:14:55.956 --> 00:15:02.820]  Now, this is a long piece here by Jared Bennett, and I don't have time to get into the whole thing, so I'm just going to go through some highlights.
[00:15:04.113 --> 00:15:19.961]  Licata sued Facebook, this is a private lawsuit, Carlo Licata, in 2015 as part of a class action lawsuit filed in Illinois State Court accusing the company of violating a one-of-a-kind Illinois law that prohibits collection of biometric data without permission.
[00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:21.942]  The lawsuit is ongoing.
[00:15:22.847 --> 00:15:26.528]  Facebook has denied the charges at the same time while admitting it's true.
[00:15:26.989 --> 00:15:28.549]  Arguing the law doesn't apply to them.
[00:15:29.009 --> 00:15:35.632]  But behind the scenes, the social network giant is working feverishly to prevent other states from enacting a law like the one in Illinois.
[00:15:36.192 --> 00:15:39.313]  Yeah, they are lobbying feverishly, folks.
[00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:41.074]  You can see how much money they're spending.
[00:15:41.094 --> 00:15:42.475]  They broke it down in this story.
[00:15:42.895 --> 00:15:47.436]  And that's because they know that they're violating our privacy with this facial recognition.
[00:15:47.476 --> 00:15:47.837]  Did you?
[00:15:47.937 --> 00:15:48.197]  Did you?
[00:15:48.977 --> 00:15:49.999]  Except facial recognition.
[00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:52.243]  Facebook users out there that aren't in Illinois.
[00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:55.830]  And the ones that are in Illinois, are you going to get behind this class action lawsuit?
[00:15:56.909 --> 00:16:03.692]  Now Facebook claims that it won't ever sell its users' data, but the company is poised to cash in on facial recognition in other ways.
[00:16:04.112 --> 00:16:23.442]  The market for facial recognition forecasts to grow 9.6 billion by 2012, and as companies look for ways to authenticate and recognize repeat customers in stores, or offer specific ads based on a customer's gender or age, or actually, maybe they might want to sell this to a security firm, because as it goes,
[00:16:23.982 --> 00:16:29.526]  Facebook now has 2 billion monthly users who upload about 350 million photos every day.
[00:16:29.546 --> 00:16:36.812]  A practically infinite amount of data that Facebook can use to train its facial recognition software, DeepFace.
[00:16:37.492 --> 00:16:42.116]  Now this is a quote from an actual Facebook worker.
[00:16:42.556 --> 00:16:50.562]  When we invented face recognition there was no database, but Facebook has a system that could recognize the entire population of Earth.
[00:16:52.096 --> 00:16:54.137]  Who do you think might be interested in that?
[00:16:55.838 --> 00:16:57.238]  Who do you think might be interested in that?
[00:16:57.279 --> 00:17:05.362]  Now, Facebook says it doesn't have any plans to directly sell its database, if you can believe that, but why would we trust Facebook?
[00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:15.887]  Now, the one law that is in Illinois requires the company to obtain permission, but again, that is unique just to Illinois.
[00:17:16.408 --> 00:17:18.569]  So, again, it's interesting
[00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:28.796]  That Facebook has all of this facial recognition technology, but you never signed up to have your facial recognition put into a database that Facebook is now using, did you?
[00:17:29.637 --> 00:17:32.419]  I don't use Facebook, but they've been doing this for a long time.
[00:17:32.479 --> 00:17:34.620]  I used to use Facebook, so, hmm.
[00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:36.082]  Interesting.
[00:17:36.142 --> 00:17:38.603]  Class action lawsuit starting in Illinois against Facebook.
[00:17:38.623 --> 00:17:39.684]  You don't hear about that.
[00:17:39.704 --> 00:17:42.126]  You don't hear about Facebook lobbying Washington behind closed doors.
[00:17:43.527 --> 00:17:44.508]  And then you've got Google.
[00:17:44.888 --> 00:17:48.611]  Google's new program to track shoppers sparks a federal privacy complaint.
[00:17:49.878 --> 00:17:56.685]  Google is now getting information from 70% of credit card companies on your spending.
[00:17:57.065 --> 00:18:04.713]  So you already know, you can already see it in real time, if you type something in the search engine or talk about something, all of a sudden personalized ads pop up.
[00:18:05.253 --> 00:18:10.998]  To try to get you to buy that product, or perhaps search for that person on Facebook or social media that you were just talking about.
[00:18:11.499 --> 00:18:15.743]  Well now they're doing the follow-up, and they're actually looking into your purchases.
[00:18:16.283 --> 00:18:23.710]  They're actually looking at your record, your transaction records, to see, are you purchasing the thing that we put there on the personalized ads?
[00:18:24.031 --> 00:18:24.872]  Is it working here?
[00:18:24.892 --> 00:18:26.073]  Does this tactic work?
[00:18:26.093 --> 00:18:26.913]  Does this tactic work?
[00:18:27.014 --> 00:18:28.855]  Again, did you sign up for any of this?
[00:18:29.736 --> 00:18:34.879]  Did you tell Google that they can look at your transactions to see if their personalized ads are working?
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:35.760]  No!
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.721]  This is a violation of your rights!
[00:18:38.782 --> 00:18:40.162]  Who is going to do something about this?
[00:18:40.383 --> 00:18:40.923]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:01.343 --> 00:19:05.820]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy!
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:11.986]  We've had some preliminary trials happening in Nevada in a lead-up to a trial for the Bundy family.
[00:23:12.007 --> 00:23:16.572]  And of course, InfoWars was there, I was there on the ground at the wash as this happened.
[00:23:17.172 --> 00:23:20.436]  And I have to say, from the very beginning, this has been
[00:23:21.457 --> 00:23:22.638]  A miscarriage of justice.
[00:23:22.678 --> 00:23:24.099]  These are political prisoners.
[00:23:24.139 --> 00:23:28.321]  And we're talking to Sherry Dovali with readoutnews.com.
[00:23:28.462 --> 00:23:31.223]  She has been attending the trial on a daily basis.
[00:23:31.584 --> 00:23:36.687]  And I want you to hear from the reporter on the scene how this is being railroaded.
[00:23:36.907 --> 00:23:42.711]  We just had one of the individuals, these are people before they get to the Bundys, they've had one individual convicted.
[00:23:43.411 --> 00:23:47.935]  And they sentenced him last week to 68 years in prison.
[00:23:48.515 --> 00:23:49.916]  Amazing that that could happen.
[00:23:50.537 --> 00:23:54.080]  And we've got a retrial of four individuals that's going on right now.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.161]  And I want Sherry, thank you for joining us, Sherry.
[00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:58.323]  You're standing outside the courthouse right now, right?
[00:23:59.264 --> 00:24:00.065]  Yes, sir, I am.
[00:24:01.225 --> 00:24:07.811]  Break down for us the rules that have been imposed, the gag rules that have been imposed on the defense by the judge.
[00:24:09.542 --> 00:24:14.886]  Well, just to let everybody know, these are not rules that were in place on the first trial.
[00:24:14.906 --> 00:24:16.427]  These are new rules.
[00:24:17.888 --> 00:24:21.571]  She has forbidden them to pretty much have a defense at all.
[00:24:22.051 --> 00:24:25.413]  They're not allowed to talk about why they came to Nevada.
[00:24:26.654 --> 00:24:34.820]  They are not allowed to talk about the video of Margaret Houston being thrown to the ground or of seeing Ammon Bundy tased.
[00:24:36.192 --> 00:24:41.074]  And I understand that these were on the mainstream media news feeds.
[00:24:41.395 --> 00:24:47.357]  They weren't just on alternative media live streams or anything like that.
[00:24:47.397 --> 00:24:50.519]  These were actually put out as news feeds, but they're not allowed to discuss them.
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.220]  And of course it's very important.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.943]  She also put a gag order on them about talking about the First Amendment zone that they created.
[00:24:56.963 --> 00:25:13.530]  When we got there, one of the first things we saw was a little area that was contained out in the middle of nowhere and it had a sign on it that was professionally printed by the BLM that said First Amendment area and somebody put a handwritten sign on it that said the First Amendment is not an area.
[00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:28.707]  And of course, it's interesting that she won't let them talk about that because she is gagging their First Amendment rights as well as their Sixth Amendment rights to have a real trial to confront the people and to talk about the issues that are at the heart of this issue.
[00:25:28.747 --> 00:25:29.989]  They can't talk about the BLM.
[00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:32.371]  They can't talk about the First Amendment zone.
[00:25:32.392 --> 00:25:34.234]  They can't talk about that county commissioner.
[00:25:34.614 --> 00:25:34.834]  I think?
[00:25:52.248 --> 00:25:59.030]  Who was outraged by that First Amendment sign, and that was one of the first things, as well as the attack that they're not allowed to talk about.
[00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:09.953]  The attack on the lady who was middle-aged, they attacked her from behind, threw her on the ground, who was a cancer survivor, Margaret Houston, who's I think the sister of Cliven Bundy.
[00:26:09.973 --> 00:26:11.373]  They weren't allowed to talk about that either.
[00:26:12.401 --> 00:26:12.941]  That's right.
[00:26:13.401 --> 00:26:19.924]  And the other thing, she's also put the kibosh on their Second Amendment rights is not a defense.
[00:26:20.524 --> 00:26:34.649]  They said, well she made it very clear, I know this is interesting, she made it very clear that even in an open carry state, if a law enforcement officer sees a weapon on your hip and feels threatened, then you are guilty of assault.
[00:26:35.515 --> 00:26:41.477]  Wow, that's amazing because we've covered Second Amendment rallies in San Antonio.
[00:26:41.517 --> 00:26:48.759]  We had San Antonio police who were harassing people that were doing open carry, legally, and so we had a massive rally.
[00:26:48.799 --> 00:26:49.999]  We had over a thousand people there.
[00:26:50.019 --> 00:26:53.260]  We had Alex Jones speaking in front of the Alamo.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.802]  We had a lot of high-ranking state political officials and everybody that was at that rally
[00:26:58.482 --> 00:27:00.804]  Was carrying, legally, openly.
[00:27:01.664 --> 00:27:14.133]  And I guess, according to them, any of those people they would have been with, the law enforcement would have been, according to this judge, within their rights to either try these people in court for assault, or maybe just to shoot them on the spot.
[00:27:14.353 --> 00:27:17.535]  But of course they wouldn't shoot people on the spot who are armed, and that was the whole point.
[00:27:17.976 --> 00:27:22.819]  The Second Amendment is not a threat to the government, if the government is following the law.
[00:27:23.219 --> 00:27:26.842]  The Second Amendment and arms in the hands of individuals is a deterrent.
[00:27:27.262 --> 00:27:29.542]  Think about it like the deterrent that we had during the Cold War.
[00:27:29.582 --> 00:27:30.943]  Nobody wanted a nuclear war.
[00:27:31.663 --> 00:27:35.883]  But having arms was one way to prevent that on both sides.
[00:27:35.923 --> 00:27:37.124]  So that's a very interesting thing.
[00:27:37.144 --> 00:27:46.405]  One of the other things I saw, and of course this isn't coming up yet because Cliven Bundy's case has not happened, but I saw that they accused him of assault and illegally carrying weapons and so forth.
[00:27:46.525 --> 00:27:52.166]  Cliven wasn't even at the wash and he never was carrying weapons the whole time that I was there.
[00:27:52.206 --> 00:27:56.347]  We were there from a few days before the standoff to the day after that.
[00:27:57.881 --> 00:28:00.623]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:01.323 --> 00:28:09.148]  She has really kind of put a war on the Constitution within this court case, and it's going to have far-reaching effects all across this nation.
[00:28:10.387 --> 00:28:28.021]  And I want to talk about how this really, the heavy handedness of the judge as well as the prosecutors in this, not only have they gagged them from putting these events into context or talking about the specifics of it, but you wrote an article, Prosecutors Seek Sanctions Against Defense Attorneys
[00:28:28.661 --> 00:28:31.363]  And this is part of this Bunkerville retrial of the four individuals.
[00:28:31.883 --> 00:28:33.204]  And talk about what happened here.
[00:28:33.224 --> 00:28:39.228]  This, of course, is about a guy who was a Trey Schilly, who was a tourist who happened to work for the U.S.
[00:28:39.288 --> 00:28:39.929]  Forest Service.
[00:28:40.429 --> 00:28:42.891]  He saw this event beginning on the road.
[00:28:42.931 --> 00:28:44.832]  He got out of his car, started taking pictures.
[00:28:44.872 --> 00:28:49.795]  He took some of the famous pictures of individuals who are prone on the bridge above.
[00:28:50.636 --> 00:28:53.118]  And they asked him if he felt fear.
[00:28:53.178 --> 00:28:54.979]  Go ahead and take it from there, Sherry.
[00:28:56.135 --> 00:28:58.597]  Yes, it seems to be the pretty obvious question.
[00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:00.819]  Who did he feel fear from?
[00:29:01.499 --> 00:29:09.505]  The defense tried to get that information out because he made it clear that he wasn't afraid of the gentleman that was lying prone on the bridge.
[00:29:09.846 --> 00:29:10.826]  He didn't fear him.
[00:29:11.307 --> 00:29:14.209]  He didn't fear any of these people that he saw carrying the gun.
[00:29:14.629 --> 00:29:16.711]  That's why he stayed there taking his pictures.
[00:29:17.171 --> 00:29:20.354]  But then on the stand, he starts talking about being afraid.
[00:29:20.374 --> 00:29:24.357]  So the defense tried to probe him as to who he was afraid of.
[00:29:25.963 --> 00:29:27.624]  Was he afraid of the BLM?
[00:29:27.724 --> 00:29:32.727]  Well, that's when the prosecutors objected, and that's when the judge shut it down.
[00:29:32.767 --> 00:29:41.152]  And then the next day, the prosecutors come back and say, we want action taken against this guy because he violated your rules to even talk about the BLM.
[00:29:41.972 --> 00:29:42.393]  That's right.
[00:29:42.413 --> 00:29:45.595]  They're not allowed to talk about any of the BLM's actions.
[00:29:46.555 --> 00:29:47.135]  That's amazing.
[00:29:48.016 --> 00:29:48.336]  It is.
[00:29:48.356 --> 00:29:49.277]  It's very amazing.
[00:29:49.337 --> 00:29:53.399]  It's a key part of the defense, and she won't allow it to be discussed.
[00:29:53.869 --> 00:30:04.523]  And now the sanctions that prosecutors are asking for are they want to review the closing statements of all of the defense attorneys before they're given.
[00:30:04.563 --> 00:30:05.605]  They want to approve them.
[00:30:05.965 --> 00:30:08.048]  Not just the one, but all of them.
[00:30:09.232 --> 00:30:12.333]  This is a railroading trial, if ever there was one.
[00:30:12.373 --> 00:30:23.178]  And of course, when you talk about this individual who was taking pictures and who he was afraid of, you look at the picture and you can see other people who are ducking down next to him beside the concrete barrier wall.
[00:30:23.338 --> 00:30:26.039]  Obviously, they're afraid of the people who are pointing guns.
[00:30:26.059 --> 00:30:27.640]  I was there on the ground.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:35.748]  Next to Ammon and they were pointing guns at us and using the loudspeaker to say we will use lethal force.
[00:30:35.968 --> 00:30:38.871]  So people were justified to be afraid of the BLM.
[00:30:39.151 --> 00:30:41.634]  Nothing like that was happening on the other side.
[00:30:42.315 --> 00:30:44.577]  And that's that's the key issue I think.
[00:30:45.057 --> 00:30:49.222]  We had a Fox News reporter who was there with us initially and he was afraid of them.
[00:30:49.602 --> 00:30:51.903]  And he started walking towards them saying, Fox News, don't shoot!
[00:30:51.963 --> 00:30:52.763]  Fox News, don't shoot!
[00:30:52.963 --> 00:30:57.524]  He's got a big camera on his shoulder and he's lifting up his shirt to show that he's not armed.
[00:30:57.845 --> 00:30:59.665]  And they started yelling at him, get away from us!
[00:31:00.045 --> 00:31:02.206]  I mean, that was the situation that was going on.
[00:31:02.226 --> 00:31:05.847]  Those people were afraid and they were talking about how they were going to use lethal force.
[00:31:06.187 --> 00:31:08.808]  That is the context that this all needs to be looked at.
[00:31:09.048 --> 00:31:15.650]  And in spite of that, there was, we only had a couple of individuals who even had guns that were out of their holsters.
[00:31:16.701 --> 00:31:17.722]  Yes, sir, that's right.
[00:31:18.022 --> 00:31:24.226]  And they have not been able to come up with a picture of any, you know, for example, Eric Parker, who was thrown on the bridge.
[00:31:24.266 --> 00:31:31.390]  They have not been able to show any picture where he is pointing his gun over that barrier at anybody specifically.
[00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:32.391]  That's right.
[00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:34.752]  We've only got about a minute and a half left.
[00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:36.713]  We've only got about a minute and a half left.
[00:31:36.774 --> 00:31:38.254]  Sherry, tell us what happened today.
[00:31:38.294 --> 00:31:39.555]  You said we had some breaking news today.
[00:31:39.575 --> 00:31:40.536]  You were at the trial this morning.
[00:31:41.443 --> 00:31:49.889]  Eric Parker has been banned from the afternoon segment of the courtroom because he allegedly looked at another defendant during a sidebar.
[00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:52.270]  Wow.
[00:31:52.370 --> 00:32:03.818]  And he was actually just looking at the view screen, but somebody complained that he was actually, they thought he was looking at another defendant, so he has now been removed from the courtroom for the afternoon.
[00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:06.537]  You cannot look at another offendant.
[00:32:06.557 --> 00:32:08.417]  You cannot talk about the BLM.
[00:32:08.457 --> 00:32:11.798]  You cannot talk about the First Amendment zones that they have there.
[00:32:12.139 --> 00:32:17.981]  And of course, this judge has turned this courtroom into a Constitution-free zone.
[00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:20.021]  This is a railroading trial.
[00:32:20.301 --> 00:32:24.163]  We're going to be talking to Sherri Duvalli as this develops.
[00:32:24.183 --> 00:32:27.504]  She's on the scene reporting for this from readoutnews.com.
[00:32:27.964 --> 00:32:28.684]  Excellent reporting.
[00:32:28.984 --> 00:32:30.185]  Take a look at their website.
[00:32:30.245 --> 00:32:35.627]  Support this important work, telling people the truth about what's going on at this trial.
[00:32:35.647 --> 00:32:38.869]  This is totally an outrage, and these people are political prisoners, Sherry.
[00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.670]  Your final comment.
[00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:42.610]  Thank you so much for having us on, and we will be back.
[00:32:43.271 --> 00:32:44.611]  Thank you so much for the work you're doing.
[00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:49.173]  Alright, again, that's Sherry Duvalli with TheReadoutNews.com.
[00:32:49.193 --> 00:32:52.635]  You can follow that, and we'll have more updates from them as these trials develop.

[00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:41.242]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[00:33:41.502 --> 00:33:50.344]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[00:33:50.544 --> 00:33:53.765]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.

[00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:03.531]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:03.692 --> 00:34:06.112]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your chemister.
[00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:13.575]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:24.098]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:34:32.263 --> 00:34:42.189]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.
[00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:50.995]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:34:51.335 --> 00:34:52.476]  That means it's clean.
[00:34:52.776 --> 00:34:53.796]  That means it's pure.
[00:34:53.896 --> 00:34:56.718]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:59.539]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:53.848]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:53.868 --> 00:36:54.729]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:36:55.009 --> 00:36:59.353]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:59.433 --> 00:37:01.595]  I'm angry I've had enough of these people
[00:37:21.587 --> 00:37:24.170]  There are a bunch of Christian murdering sons.
[00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:30.235]  There are giant death factories keeping babies alive and selling their body parts.
[00:37:30.356 --> 00:37:33.018]  You need to know that these people are gone.
[00:37:33.138 --> 00:37:34.600]  This is gone.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.302]  They've been truly brought from under rocks.
[00:37:37.362 --> 00:37:40.265]  They have green looking skin, run around screaming.
[00:37:40.305 --> 00:37:42.828]  We love Satan, we want to meet baby.
[00:37:49.919 --> 00:38:01.787]  We're good.
[00:38:21.148 --> 00:38:22.249]  I'm primitive.
[00:38:22.509 --> 00:38:22.890]  I'm real.
[00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:24.911]  I know the enemy.
[00:38:24.951 --> 00:38:28.094]  You tell them I'm a globalist.
[00:38:48.405 --> 00:38:50.766]  We're sick, self-centered crap.
[00:38:50.966 --> 00:38:55.649]  We don't even notice how it's all rising up against us.
[00:38:56.029 --> 00:39:02.953]  Billions of horny people of the very worst type, and I'm so pissed.
[00:39:04.494 --> 00:39:08.396]  We're gonna stab your daughter at the mall.
[00:39:10.317 --> 00:39:15.940]  We're gonna stab your wife, your son,
[00:39:19.619 --> 00:39:21.621]  We're gonna stab you with a butcher knife!
[00:39:34.764 --> 00:39:42.409]  And that was a musical montage that I put together of some of the acts that have been submitting, some of the artists that have been submitting into this contest.
[00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:46.933]  InfoWars announces $20K in prizes for Best Hillary's Into Creepy Weird Sick Stuff Man.
[00:39:47.113 --> 00:39:47.933]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:39:48.013 --> 00:39:48.714]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:39:48.994 --> 00:39:49.534]  Cover song.
[00:39:49.574 --> 00:39:53.117]  This is the folk song made by Super Deluxe and Nick Lutzko.
[00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:54.318]  And as we say here at InfoWars,
[00:39:54.838 --> 00:39:57.040]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[00:40:14.011 --> 00:40:14.671]  Take it as it is.
[00:40:14.711 --> 00:40:18.333]  Now, one of our contestants, Vee Reyes, I liked her first submission she sent in.
[00:40:18.553 --> 00:40:26.497]  She really did a good job combining all the elements and taking some artistic license into this project.
[00:40:26.537 --> 00:40:27.837]  So Vee, welcome to the show.
[00:40:28.498 --> 00:40:30.018]  What made you want to get into this contest?
[00:40:31.859 --> 00:40:42.764]  Well, I am a patriot and I am an avid InfoWars listener, and part of my vision as a Christian singer-songwriter is to be a Christian presence in media
[00:40:43.467 --> 00:40:44.490]  And entertainment.
[00:40:45.131 --> 00:40:50.424]  So this was my perfect opportunity to do what I do and be a part of the InfoWar.
[00:40:51.181 --> 00:40:52.462]  And you've done a couple versions.
[00:40:52.502 --> 00:41:00.186]  In fact, when we go out to break here, we're going to play another version that you did and that you submitted over the weekend.
[00:41:00.827 --> 00:41:02.588]  And it was a live version of you doing it.
[00:41:02.608 --> 00:41:05.810]  The other one was recorded and you told me you're going to go in the studio and do another one.
[00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:14.095]  But you said you had some issues with your bandmates not all wanting to participate with some political intrigue going on there.
[00:41:14.135 --> 00:41:19.258]  So what is that like trying to get them to perform this song, which has got some pretty inflammatory lyrics?
[00:41:20.367 --> 00:41:23.668]  As you know, there's a lot of opposition with political opinions.
[00:41:24.189 --> 00:41:27.530]  And, you know, these people are really dear friends of mine.
[00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:36.873]  And as much as I want everyone to be aware, I have to understand that not everyone is on the same level of willing to embrace certain really harsh truths.
[00:41:36.954 --> 00:41:38.534]  So I try to just be respectful.
[00:41:39.174 --> 00:41:43.156]  But yeah, even one dancer, I wanted to come and kind of do the flags.
[00:41:44.312 --> 00:41:51.299]  She heard it was for InfoWars and she said that a friend of hers had been a parent of one of the Sandy Hook victims and so she couldn't participate.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.045]  Which made me research the Sandy Hook thing again and realize, I want to talk to your friend.
[00:41:56.445 --> 00:42:03.033]  I want to know what she has to say about this because there's no way that that was real with the evidence presented.
[00:42:03.863 --> 00:42:12.291]  There is a lot of weird events that happen around Sandy Hook, and I've hosted debates between people who were for and against it.
[00:42:12.311 --> 00:42:15.874]  I had Wolfgang Halbig on along with a writer for American Free Press.
[00:42:16.274 --> 00:42:22.780]  But yeah, there's a lot of unanswered questions to that event, and even when we had the Megyn Kelly special, which
[00:42:23.681 --> 00:42:25.642]  Talking about No Weapon Formed Against Us shall prosper.
[00:42:26.103 --> 00:42:27.804]  She's now had her show canceled.
[00:42:28.044 --> 00:42:33.948]  She had two shows left in supposedly this season, but they went ahead and cut them so she could work on her morning show.
[00:42:34.328 --> 00:42:51.599]  So what happens when you go after Alex Jones is people start to look at what Alex Jones is saying and go, wait, you know, yeah, he's a little wild, he's a little loud, but there's some truth to what he's saying, especially when it comes to gay frogs and atrazine in the water, which a lot of people attack him for saying, you know, this gay frog business.
[00:42:52.259 --> 00:42:53.779]  So you've opened for people like B.B.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.380]  King, ZZ Top, James Brown.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:02.182]  And then I was talking to you earlier, you said, you know, I kind of put my music on hold and had, you know, got a real job, quote unquote.
[00:43:02.462 --> 00:43:08.384]  Why is it so hard for people just in the music business to make a good living at it, but also stay true to their own message?
[00:43:09.604 --> 00:43:14.546]  Well, Rob, it's easy to put out content that will get likes and that will be popular.
[00:43:15.346 --> 00:43:17.627]  But I'm more about quality than quantity.
[00:43:17.707 --> 00:43:21.888]  I would rather influence two people with quality than influence
[00:43:22.626 --> 00:43:26.429]  200,000 or 2 million with something that's just quantity.
[00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:28.091]  And so I had that choice.
[00:43:28.211 --> 00:43:29.512]  I recorded with Vin Diesel.
[00:43:29.932 --> 00:43:31.954]  He wanted to start a record label and put me on it.
[00:43:32.014 --> 00:43:34.576]  And I recorded with Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic.
[00:43:34.736 --> 00:43:38.159]  And I was offered big opportunity, but it was not quality.
[00:43:38.179 --> 00:43:40.121]  And I had to make a choice.
[00:43:40.321 --> 00:43:42.763]  Am I going to influence people negatively?
[00:43:44.024 --> 00:43:50.349]  Or am I going to stand firm in what I believe and influence a few with quality?
[00:43:50.911 --> 00:43:52.532]  So I believe I made the right choice.
[00:43:54.712 --> 00:43:57.273]  And what is it like singing this song?
[00:43:57.293 --> 00:44:00.714]  Because it's, it's got some, you know, pretty wild lyrics.
[00:44:01.375 --> 00:44:02.875]  I sing it, my kids sing it.
[00:44:02.995 --> 00:44:07.617]  It's pretty, it's pretty funny listening to them sing it about loving their Somalis.
[00:44:08.077 --> 00:44:10.738]  But, you know, what do the lyrics say to you in this song?
[00:44:12.418 --> 00:44:19.581]  Well, what I love about this song is that I believe that satire and the creative arts are the stealth bomber in the info war.
[00:44:20.492 --> 00:44:26.634]  You can say a lot more through satire or through music than you can say just blatantly.
[00:44:26.794 --> 00:44:33.216]  And interestingly enough, music goes straight to the heart in some scientific studies, unlike information or words that go to the mind.
[00:44:33.696 --> 00:44:36.537]  We process it and then we decide whether we let it go to the heart.
[00:44:36.557 --> 00:44:40.218]  So music is interestingly powerful, but the lyrics are difficult.
[00:44:40.298 --> 00:44:47.460]  It's very, um, the lyrics are like syncopated and I believe wholeheartedly in all the content.
[00:44:48.351 --> 00:44:54.375]  I've come to find that Alex Jones is a very reliable news source, as is InfoWars.
[00:44:54.835 --> 00:44:57.497]  And I follow it, so I know every reference made in the song.
[00:44:57.577 --> 00:45:00.939]  So I believe in it, but it's hard to sing because it's depressing.
[00:45:00.959 --> 00:45:03.000]  These are hard truths to face.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.161]  This is really heavy.
[00:45:05.622 --> 00:45:07.603]  But at the same time, people need to understand.
[00:45:07.623 --> 00:45:14.267]  That's why in one of my videos, I did a lot of post-apocalyptic, end-of-the-world kind of scenes, because that's where we're going if people don't do something.
[00:45:15.447 --> 00:45:15.647]  Right.
[00:45:15.687 --> 00:45:18.408]  If we let the globalists take over, it's done.
[00:45:18.488 --> 00:45:34.814]  It's going to be a future where there's a few elites and masses of poor people scraping along for a few basic resources when this world has plenty of resources to offer as long as we figure out ways to, you know, they're talking about creating protein out of electricity now.
[00:45:34.874 --> 00:45:39.355]  I mean, technology is going to catch up and help us solve our problems as we work at them.
[00:45:40.535 --> 00:45:40.816]  Right.
[00:45:41.576 --> 00:45:41.916]  So true.
[00:45:42.762 --> 00:45:52.468]  And one thing I would say, though, to the author of this song, who I'm not sure who it is, but as a singer who is, like, gospel, jazz, blues, vocally it's so boring.
[00:45:53.008 --> 00:46:02.454]  And I tried to do a jazz, like, gospel version of it, but I couldn't get it worked out in time, but it's kind of funny that musically you're, like, singing the same three notes over and over again.
[00:46:03.014 --> 00:46:05.896]  Well, thanks for joining us, V, and best of luck in the contest.
[00:46:05.916 --> 00:46:08.918]  There's a lot of great entries, so kudos to you for participating.
[00:46:10.179 --> 00:46:11.040]  Thank you for having me.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:12.120]  All right.
[00:46:12.501 --> 00:46:17.184]  And be sure out there, when you enter the contest, be sure you put Info Wars in the video.
[00:46:17.224 --> 00:46:18.085]  It's very important.
[00:46:18.105 --> 00:46:22.528]  And with that, we're going to go out to V's latest entry she submitted over the weekend.
[00:46:22.548 --> 00:46:25.370]  This is a live version of her doing the Bon Iver Alex Jones.
[00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:27.351]  Oh, let's see what the song is.
[00:46:27.752 --> 00:46:29.593]  Hillary's into Creepy Weird Sick Stuff, man.
[00:46:29.673 --> 00:46:30.313]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:46:30.454 --> 00:46:31.454]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:46:31.734 --> 00:46:33.135]  It's part of our cover song contest.
[00:46:33.175 --> 00:46:33.696]  You can win up to $20,000.
[00:46:33.736 --> 00:46:34.957]  So get your entry in today.
[00:46:34.977 --> 00:46:35.397]  Oh, I'm angry.
[00:46:40.397 --> 00:46:51.727]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.814]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.894 --> 00:48:20.055]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.215 --> 00:48:25.118]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nacinidine X2.
[00:48:25.318 --> 00:48:30.301]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.481 --> 00:48:34.043]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.363 --> 00:48:37.325]  Still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.365 --> 00:48:38.625]  It's a key building block of the body.
[00:48:38.745 --> 00:48:45.669]  And if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:48.431]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.451 --> 00:48:49.471]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.811 --> 00:48:50.512]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.552 --> 00:48:51.152]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.532 --> 00:48:59.076]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.096 --> 00:48:59.957]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.977 --> 00:49:00.017]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.343 --> 00:49:14.307]  One of the things that came up in the campaign, it came up in the debates, and Donald Trump has talked about it quite a bit, are vaccines.
[00:49:14.407 --> 00:49:16.529]  And of course, Donald Trump is on our side on this.
[00:49:16.569 --> 00:49:25.957]  He's concerned about the heavy dosage of vaccines that are given at a very early age, this schedule that continues to increase and increase.
[00:49:25.977 --> 00:49:29.380]  He's concerned about the health effects, about autism.
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:38.546]  And we've talked about this in the past, but I want you to hear what Ralph Fusatola, the vitamin lawyer, and of course you can find him at globalhealthfreedom.org.
[00:49:39.146 --> 00:49:49.573]  There are a couple petitions that are in circulation right now, and we want to talk about the process of getting this moving forward and how you can help to do this.
[00:49:49.893 --> 00:49:55.937]  We have an ally in the White House that's on our side who will listen to this now, but what do we need to do to bring this
[00:49:56.397 --> 00:50:00.003]  to the public's attention, to bring this to President Trump's attention.
[00:50:00.043 --> 00:50:02.327]  Joining us now is Ralph Fusatola.
[00:50:02.467 --> 00:50:04.150]  Thank you for joining us, Mr. Fusatola.
[00:50:05.412 --> 00:50:05.472]  Hey!
[00:50:05.693 --> 00:50:06.694]  Hello, hello, David.
[00:50:06.955 --> 00:50:07.977]  Always a pleasure to be with you.
[00:50:08.496 --> 00:50:16.838]  Now there's a couple of petitions that are out here, and we've got a petition, of course, on the White House, and we've seen these types of things before.
[00:50:17.378 --> 00:50:19.278]  We've done this throughout the Obama administration.
[00:50:19.318 --> 00:50:20.619]  We've had a lot of signatures.
[00:50:20.679 --> 00:50:24.140]  I think once it gets past, what is it, 100,000, they have to make a statement.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.400]  But that's all they have to do, is just make a statement.
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.821]  So this is more than just a protest at this point.
[00:50:30.501 --> 00:50:36.646]  We've now got another petition, and explain to the audience the importance of a petition at regulations.gov.
[00:50:36.666 --> 00:50:38.928]  This is something that was filed by a California lawyer.
[00:50:38.948 --> 00:50:44.092]  You can talk about him and talk about the essence of that, but also about the process that we're in right now.
[00:50:45.514 --> 00:50:45.914]  All right.
[00:50:46.154 --> 00:50:57.724]  Well, my colleague Kent Eken-Lively, who's a lawyer in California and has a vaccine-injured child, and I and a couple of other patriot lawyers got together and we drafted a formal petition
[00:50:58.507 --> 00:50:59.489]  That's good to know.
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.041]  This is a little bit different.
[00:51:13.061 --> 00:51:15.763]  This is actually a petition that has legal standing.
[00:51:16.204 --> 00:51:26.313]  Most people don't realize it, but most federal regulations start as citizens' petitions through the Administrative Practices Act, the APA.
[00:51:26.753 --> 00:51:34.320]  And those petitions, well, the agencies get thousands of them a year, and they cherry pick what they want to make their regulations.
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:35.821]  We're giving President Trump
[00:51:36.241 --> 00:51:39.242]  an opportunity to do that as well.
[00:51:39.582 --> 00:51:44.703]  We're giving him the legal basis to act to do something that we think the time has come.
[00:51:45.083 --> 00:51:48.924]  We want a five-year childhood vaccination moratoria.
[00:51:49.524 --> 00:52:01.827]  You know, since our right to sue for vaccine injuries was taken away from us by Congress in the mid-1980s, we have had hundreds of thousands of children who have been diagnosed with autism.
[00:52:01.867 --> 00:52:04.328]  We've had thousands of children who have died
[00:52:04.793 --> 00:52:13.780]  And we've had many, many families who have been compensated, if you can call it that, for the death of their child through the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:13.860]  Why?
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:19.564]  Because our courts have said that vaccines are, and I quote, unavoidably unsafe.
[00:52:20.134 --> 00:52:20.574]  End quote.
[00:52:20.914 --> 00:52:24.896]  And if something is unavoidably unsafe, we cannot force it on our children.
[00:52:25.236 --> 00:52:29.578]  That's why we're demanding a five-year childhood vaccination moratorium.
[00:52:29.978 --> 00:52:34.080]  And then let's see if we can find out whether vaccines are safe and effective.
[00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:44.244]  Federal statutes specifically require the FDA and the CDC to go through a process of approving vaccines, which we claim they have failed to do.
[00:52:45.109 --> 00:53:11.312]  And indeed, when you take into account the level of self-serving and self-interest on the CDC committees that recommend vaccines, you begin to realize that there are tens of millions of dollars at stake and individuals who have patents, for example, on vaccines and stand to make lots of money are allowed to vote on the CDC committee to approve those very same vaccines.
[00:53:12.199 --> 00:53:13.439]  No conflict of interest there.
[00:53:13.519 --> 00:53:15.660]  They don't have to recuse themselves.
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.781]  They just have to say, hey, I have an interest.
[00:53:18.421 --> 00:53:33.767]  And I cite Dr. Paul Offit, the Vax Pusher's favorite ethicist, who's a physician at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, who was allowed to vote in favor of a vaccine in which he made tens of millions of dollars due to royalties.
[00:53:34.541 --> 00:53:45.748]  The corruption is absolutely amazing and I think let's tell people because many of our listeners I think know about the vaccine court but I think you mentioned that in passing and that's something that people need to stop and think about.
[00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:55.535]  You said the regular courts said that we're going to shut down the entire vaccine industry unless we exempt them from lawsuits because it's so dangerous.
[00:53:55.555 --> 00:53:58.477]  So what they did was they created a special vaccine court
[00:53:58.897 --> 00:54:02.239]  Where people who are damaged can go to get compensation.
[00:54:02.499 --> 00:54:06.541]  That has been completely swept under the carpet by the mainstream media.
[00:54:06.581 --> 00:54:10.423]  They do not talk about the vaccine court, where people who are injured go there.
[00:54:10.463 --> 00:54:14.826]  Most people who are injured don't know about it, to go get compensation there at that court.
[00:54:14.846 --> 00:54:22.110]  But then as you point out, they allow incredible conflict of interest to exist on these people at that court.
[00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:24.051]  So it is truly a kangaroo court.
[00:54:24.091 --> 00:54:26.372]  But now we have a legal process that you're pointing out,
[00:54:26.912 --> 00:54:34.635]  of starting a petition at regulations.gov and let's show people where they can go to make a comment on this petition.
[00:54:34.955 --> 00:54:40.017]  So let's show the screen there at regulations.gov and what people need to type in there.
[00:54:40.077 --> 00:54:45.899]  If you go there and in the box, notice the previous screen, go back to the previous screen Julian, you type in FDA-2017-P-4500.
[00:54:45.919 --> 00:54:48.660]  Show them the screen where they go, log in Julian.
[00:54:54.222 --> 00:54:54.482]  I think so.
[00:55:11.175 --> 00:55:27.862]  This is the beginning of a legal process, and as Dr. Fusatola pointed out, this will be the means by which we can start the legal process, we can aid President Trump in something that I believe he understands and he wants to see something done about.
[00:55:28.162 --> 00:55:30.283]  Go ahead, Ralph Fusatola.
[00:55:30.603 --> 00:55:33.725]  We've begun the legal process to have standing to sue.
[00:55:34.005 --> 00:55:36.646]  This is called exhausting your administrative remedies.
[00:55:36.926 --> 00:55:39.387]  We've set up a special page, an FAQ page,
[00:55:39.947 --> 00:55:46.991]  To give people information on this, you can go to that page and you'll have a link directly to the correct spot on regulations.gov.
[00:55:47.211 --> 00:55:54.834]  And that page is tinyurl.com forward slash vaccine moratorium.
[00:55:55.255 --> 00:55:58.396]  It's one of those tiny URLs that help you get short links.
[00:55:58.676 --> 00:56:02.278]  tinyurl.com forward slash vaccine moratorium.
[00:56:02.658 --> 00:56:05.139]  And it'll get you to the right spot, the right instructions.
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:06.020]  We need
[00:56:06.903 --> 00:56:12.104]  Not just thousands, not just hundreds of thousands, but we need millions of people to do this.
[00:56:12.364 --> 00:56:17.246]  And I know InfoWars is the one place where we can reach those millions of people.
[00:56:17.406 --> 00:56:18.346]  We need you to act now.
[00:56:18.786 --> 00:56:20.807]  The future of our children literally depend on it.
[00:56:21.427 --> 00:56:21.907]  Absolutely.
[00:56:22.007 --> 00:56:27.748]  And let's understand that we've got somebody on the other side who has a sympathetic ear, as we've reported here at InfoWars.
[00:56:27.769 --> 00:56:29.309]  We had Trump oppose vaccines.
[00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:30.269]  He warned of autism.
[00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:32.050]  This is back in June of 2012.
[00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:32.210]  Yeah.
[00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:42.095]  And then in the debates, we had the back and forth between Dr. Carson, who said, I don't see any connection, and Donald Trump pointed out at the time, look, it made one of my employees sick.
[00:56:42.135 --> 00:56:45.496]  And he talked about how they had an immediate reaction to this.
[00:56:46.017 --> 00:56:46.737]  They got very sick.
[00:56:46.777 --> 00:56:48.518]  They contracted autism.
[00:56:48.898 --> 00:56:49.979]  So he understands that.
[00:56:49.999 --> 00:56:58.823]  We've even had rumors, haven't we, Ralph, about Robert Kennedy Jr., who is very much aware of this problem.
[00:56:58.943 --> 00:57:01.785]  We've had rumors that he would be appointed to a vaccine committee.
[00:57:02.796 --> 00:57:15.223]  There are, in fact, drafts of an executive order floating around, and we've been in touch through some other members of our little lawyers committee with Kennedy, and we think that he's moving forward in a very good way.
[00:57:15.643 --> 00:57:17.504]  We have no other people who are doing the same.
[00:57:17.844 --> 00:57:27.089]  There is a growing vaccine choice movement, and we're saying to that vaccine freedom of choice movement, that informed consent movement, that we have to go a step further.
[00:57:27.609 --> 00:57:29.610]  It's not enough to say we want freedom to choose.
[00:57:30.131 --> 00:57:32.012]  We need to protect the children.
[00:57:32.312 --> 00:57:38.456]  And that means we need a moratorium for at least five years, it should be forever, on childhood vaccination.
[00:57:38.836 --> 00:57:42.158]  They must do the proper studies that have never been done.
[00:57:42.178 --> 00:57:45.760]  And until they do that, they are literally murdering children.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.041]  Must stop.
[00:57:47.873 --> 00:57:48.393]  I agree with you.
[00:57:48.474 --> 00:57:48.914]  Absolutely.
[00:57:48.934 --> 00:57:52.817]  So we're going to put the notes on how to get there and sign that petition.
[00:57:52.857 --> 00:57:58.582]  People are always saying, you guys are always complaining about stuff, but you don't ever have a plan for a course of action.
[00:57:58.662 --> 00:58:00.563]  This is a plan for course of action.
[00:58:01.204 --> 00:58:04.566]  Public pressure on the FDA to do the right thing.
[00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:11.132]  And again, we have with the president, somebody who is sympathetic to the cause, somebody who has seen how this happens.
[00:58:11.372 --> 00:58:12.853]  So we're going to put the instructions there.
[00:58:13.113 --> 00:58:14.334]  Go to regulations.gov.
[00:58:14.374 --> 00:58:16.336]  We'll show you what to in the comment section.
[00:58:16.756 --> 00:58:19.458]  Watch a type in there and you can leave your comment.
[00:58:19.478 --> 00:58:22.480]  Let's build this momentum that we have here.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.720]  Let's take advantage of this.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:29.704]  We're so close and we have the best opportunity we've ever had to have health freedom in this area.
[00:58:29.744 --> 00:58:30.124]  Who knows?
[00:58:30.425 --> 00:58:32.246]  Maybe we'll get rid of Obamacare as well.
[00:58:32.266 --> 00:58:33.206]  So thank you for joining us.
[00:58:33.527 --> 00:58:36.448]  Ralph Fusatola and you can find him at globalhealthfreedom.org.
[00:58:37.529 --> 00:58:43.634]  And I want to reiterate, this is something you can do to save your children, to have health choices.
[00:58:43.754 --> 00:58:48.237]  Go to regulations.gov and we're going to have in the notes there what you type in there.
[00:58:48.818 --> 00:58:49.839]  That's it for tonight's news.
[00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:50.699]  Thank you for joining us.
