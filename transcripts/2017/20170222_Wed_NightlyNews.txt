[00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:16.192]  Welcome to this live edition of the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:16.252 --> 00:00:16.992]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:17.032 --> 00:00:19.133]  It's Wednesday, February the 22nd, 2017.
[00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.714]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:24.014 --> 00:00:27.515]  Tonight on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:35.658]  InfoWars has been banned from one of the world's largest advertising platforms for its dangerous political rhetoric.
[00:00:36.545 --> 00:00:48.731]  In an unprecedented attack on the Liberty Movement and free speech, this ban is a critical blow to the pumping heart of the Info War, as we are an independent media organization, funded by you, the people.
[00:00:49.952 --> 00:00:57.516]  We are in the midst of the Defense of Liberty 13-hour special broadcast, ending with a live AMA with Alex Jones.
[00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:02.098]  All this and more on the Info War's Nightly News.
[00:01:05.672 --> 00:01:15.243]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:01:15.704 --> 00:01:17.466]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:01:17.626 --> 00:01:18.166]  Think about it.
[00:01:18.387 --> 00:01:24.193]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:01:24.414 --> 00:01:25.315]  But on the other hand,
[00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:29.996]  The Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:39.717]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources, or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media.
[00:01:40.398 --> 00:01:47.019]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.279]  We're making freedom go viral.
[00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:54.740]  And now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:06.431]  InfoWars Prime, where you can watch live high-definition feeds of the Alex Jones Show, plus exclusive insider videos from the InfoWars crew and behind-the-scenes action.

[00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.561]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:22.225 --> 00:03:24.286]  Welcome back to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:03:24.326 --> 00:03:26.887]  Tonight we have a live and free edition.
[00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:30.547]  Of course, it's a part of our 13-hour broadcast that we set up yesterday.
[00:03:31.068 --> 00:03:37.029]  We learned that a Google surrogate, AdRoll, was going to remove us from being able to advertise.
[00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.370]  We try to fund ourselves by offering direct products.
[00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.571]  We have separate websites that do that, and yet they are saying they're going to delist us because we are
[00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:51.976]  Tonight, as an example of the kind of censorship that we're getting, last night I had a report about the Swedish riots, and you remember the chronology that we had last
[00:04:13.072 --> 00:04:21.079]  Saturday we had Donald Trump talking about the fact that the Swedish migrants were causing all kinds of terrorizing attacks.
[00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.640]  Okay, call that a terror attack.
[00:04:22.701 --> 00:04:31.949]  Okay, technically what he's talking about is how the Swedish residents have been terrorized by these migrants that have come in there at a per capita rate that is far higher than any other country.
[00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:36.532]  They have a crime rate now in some of the cities where they have the highest concentration.
[00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:39.474]  It's three times what it is in a typical European capital.
[00:04:39.554 --> 00:04:40.875]  I reported on this last night.
[00:04:40.935 --> 00:04:56.547]  I reported on the fact that the Swedish government was covering this up, that they were censoring this, that they were threatening the officers who talked about this, the police officers who said that we are told that we can't talk about this, recrimination is made against us.
[00:04:56.567 --> 00:04:57.028]  Well, guess what?
[00:04:57.648 --> 00:05:03.570]  That report, on Google, was then listed as an age-restricted report.
[00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.892]  Now, there's nothing in this report that is rated R, and we're going to show you.
[00:05:07.912 --> 00:05:10.432]  There you see, that's what you get when you try to play that report.
[00:05:10.512 --> 00:05:14.054]  It's age-restricted, as if this is some kind of pornography or something.
[00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:14.574]  No, it's not.
[00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:17.256]  It's a report about the violence that happened there.
[00:05:17.276 --> 00:05:29.946]  And of course, this was on Monday night after the media, and especially all the late night comedians, were mocking Donald Trump all through the weekend, all on Monday, and then we have this massive riot.
[00:05:30.286 --> 00:05:32.588]  And then they take down my report about it.
[00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:35.431]  Censorship of a report on censorship.
[00:05:35.991 --> 00:05:38.932]  Spinning the news, when we talk about how they are spinning the news.
[00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:40.012]  That's the way they do this.
[00:05:40.532 --> 00:05:59.337]  Now today we've seen more evidence of this as you've heard us talk about this on Morning Joe, Mika Brzezinski, who of course is there as the daughter of Zbigniew Brzezinski, the guy who's going to bring us the technocratic tyranny that he has worked on creating the Trilateral Commission.
[00:05:59.997 --> 00:06:03.018]  And that's what we have seen with the globalists follow that pattern.
[00:06:03.638 --> 00:06:07.899]  They came up with a trade treaty that was going to unify the three blocks.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.780]  North America, Europe, and Asia.
[00:06:11.321 --> 00:06:13.821]  And of course they were going to do that economically and then politically.
[00:06:13.861 --> 00:06:15.122]  We know what this pattern is.
[00:06:15.162 --> 00:06:16.482]  We've talked about what this pattern is.
[00:06:16.522 --> 00:06:19.583]  That's why Trump's election is so important.
[00:06:19.603 --> 00:06:25.325]  But what she said was, going full Ministry of Truth, our job is to control exactly what people say.
[00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:31.347]  She said Trump could have undermined the messaging so much that he can actually control what people think.
[00:06:31.407 --> 00:06:32.608]  And that is our job.
[00:06:33.348 --> 00:06:40.410]  See, they see themselves as not only a branch of the government, but they need to tell you what to think.
[00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.531]  See, here at InfoWars, we don't think our job is to control what you think.
[00:06:45.251 --> 00:06:47.152]  Our job is to get you to think.
[00:06:47.712 --> 00:06:50.493]  Our job is to get you to question authority.
[00:06:50.793 --> 00:06:55.114]  Don't believe something because it's told to you by Mika Brzezinski or by CNN.
[00:06:55.154 --> 00:06:56.515]  And of course, tomorrow,
[00:06:57.555 --> 00:06:59.276]  I think it's tomorrow that it's going to be coming out.
[00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:01.877]  We have James O'Keefe, Project Veritas.
[00:07:02.337 --> 00:07:03.958]  Yes, it is tomorrow that he's going to be coming out.
[00:07:04.398 --> 00:07:10.400]  And he says that it looks like he's going to have hundreds of hours of newsroom footage of a key network.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.322]  And of course, he hinted when he was talking to Sean Hannity that that was going to be CNN.
[00:07:14.762 --> 00:07:22.265]  He said the next 48 hours, Project Veritas, like WikiLeaks, will be releasing hundreds of hours of tape from within the media establishment.
[00:07:22.365 --> 00:07:24.826]  Our next target is, in fact, the media.
[00:07:25.106 --> 00:07:27.267]  And Sean Hannity said, how long have you been working on this?
[00:07:27.307 --> 00:07:33.189]  He said, we've had people on the inside come to us, just like Julian Assange had people come to him.
[00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:39.692]  We've had people, sources, come to us and give us information, and we're going to be releasing it WikiLeaks style this week.
[00:07:39.732 --> 00:07:41.653]  And so he asked, can you give us a hint of the organization?
[00:07:41.673 --> 00:07:44.314]  He said, well, it's one that Trump's been talking about a lot.
[00:07:44.614 --> 00:08:01.739]  You can probably use your imagination and Sean Hannity said that so it's CNN and so we're going to see the people who say they are the most trusted name in news we're going to see they're going to become the most busted name in news and so we're anxious to see how that's going to happen but of course there's also
[00:08:02.802 --> 00:08:09.547]  Not just the censorship of our ads, not just taking down our videos, and of course it's not just my video that got an R-listing.
[00:08:10.007 --> 00:08:13.690]  We've had several videos that Alex Jones talked about.
[00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:20.555]  One in particular, 14 million views just disappeared, flushed down the memory hole by these people who are banding together as a ministry of truth.
[00:08:21.195 --> 00:08:32.242]  This is a very wide process, and of course when they can't get traction with the news media because CNN has lost its credibility when nobody's paying attention to them, they try to make us go away on the internet.
[00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:37.705]  But if that's not even good enough for them, they're now attacking us through the entertainment medium.
[00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:41.808]  And of course we have this story today on InfoWars that Homeland is now
[00:08:42.628 --> 00:08:44.389]  Creating an Alex Jones character.
[00:08:44.869 --> 00:08:49.311]  As Paul Joseph Watson puts it, it's a lame attempt to smear InfoWars.
[00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:55.413]  He said, it's a transparent effort to discredit InfoWars and appease liberals via the medium of entertainment.
[00:08:55.773 --> 00:08:59.895]  This Alex Jones character was introduced early in the season via a voice on the radio.
[00:08:59.975 --> 00:09:04.497]  One of the lead characters, Quinn, is seen obsessively listening to the show.
[00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:11.905]  The same characters become violent, semi-deranged, surviving a biological assassination attempt, and a stroke.
[00:09:11.925 --> 00:09:20.715]  And I'm going to play you a little excerpt of their teaser here and listen to how much this guy sounds like Alex Jones when he's angry.
[00:09:20.735 --> 00:09:25.500]  Do we have the audio?
[00:09:27.362 --> 00:09:27.662]  Boom!
[00:09:27.682 --> 00:09:28.983]  That's what you get!
[00:09:51.226 --> 00:09:53.508]  That's the state of the attack on InfoWars.
[00:09:53.528 --> 00:09:54.950]  They're coming at us at every level.
[00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:02.197]  Trying to attack the way we fund ourselves, trying to mock us in the media, and Watson sums it up this way.
[00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:06.942]  He says the fact that an Alex Jones character has been written into this show tells us two things.
[00:10:07.002 --> 00:10:10.626]  Number one, we're part of the cultural zeitgeist and we can't be ignored.
[00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:11.167]  Number two,
[00:10:11.767 --> 00:10:22.773]  The establishment knows that young people don't watch TV news, they don't trust mainstream media, so they have to resort to propaganda placement by smearing Alex Jones through the media of fictional entertainment.
[00:10:23.534 --> 00:10:25.174]  Let's take a look at what's going on with the news today.
[00:10:25.195 --> 00:10:32.959]  Of course, in financial circles, we now have the Feds, the masters of the economy, the people who are unelected, unaccountable.
[00:10:33.439 --> 00:10:35.921]  We're not even allowed to audit them, this private organization.
[00:10:35.961 --> 00:10:40.083]  They're now saying that they see a rate hike, another one, coming fairly soon.
[00:10:40.123 --> 00:10:44.586]  And of course, we didn't have rate hikes for a very, very long time under the Obama administration.
[00:10:44.626 --> 00:10:48.888]  They did everything to keep interest rates low to try to help the Obama administration.
[00:10:48.928 --> 00:10:54.151]  And we've already had one rate hike after the election, and they're getting ready to do another.
[00:10:54.191 --> 00:11:00.875]  As a matter of fact, after they did that first rate hike, they signaled the fact that they were looking at another three rate hikes after that.
[00:11:00.915 --> 00:11:02.256]  We've seen this all before, haven't we?
[00:11:02.856 --> 00:11:10.600]  We saw the Fed artificially drop interest rates continuously for a very long time, basically creating a kind of trough, if you looked at the graph.
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:25.428]  Dropping interest rates successively for a very long time, holding them there, creating a bubble economy, and then through a series of rapid rates about one quarter of a point, about every quarter, they burst that balloon.
[00:11:25.488 --> 00:11:28.769]  That's what brought us, that's a key part of what brought us the housing crisis.
[00:11:29.109 --> 00:11:29.610]  And so now,
[00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:34.331]  We have the GOP dragging their feet on a tax cut, of course dragging their feet on Obamacare.
[00:11:34.371 --> 00:11:36.691]  Now Trump is going to take the lead on this, he said.
[00:11:37.151 --> 00:11:49.134]  He's going to give us something in the beginning to the middle of March, and he's going to have to take the lead because the Republicans, even though we've elected them to do this a couple of years ago, they will not take the lead in getting rid of the financial burdens of Obamacare.
[00:11:49.394 --> 00:11:50.754]  So that's going to have to come from Trump.
[00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:54.795]  Hopefully that's going to happen within the next couple weeks, but then also there's the issue of tax cuts.
[00:11:55.655 --> 00:12:02.497]  Are they going to drag their feet on that while the Federal Reserve is allowed to continually raise interest rates?
[00:12:02.537 --> 00:12:04.058]  It's going to be very interesting to see what happens.
[00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:16.802]  Federal Reserve officials have expressed confidence that they can raise interest rates gradually, yeah, and continuously, I would add, while a hike fairly soon might be appropriate to avoid the risk of an overheated economy.
[00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:20.844]  Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's latest meeting show.
[00:12:20.864 --> 00:12:22.925]  There is nothing open about their committee, folks.
[00:12:22.945 --> 00:12:24.986]  Let's just understand that.
[00:12:25.387 --> 00:12:30.150]  This is wrong on so many different levels, but of course they're going to manipulate this politically.
[00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.331]  It's a private organization.
[00:12:31.671 --> 00:12:33.693]  They don't just get rich off of this.
[00:12:33.733 --> 00:12:35.414]  They also manipulate our economy.
[00:12:36.348 --> 00:12:38.390]  Now at the same time, we see some positive news.
[00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:45.837]  I don't know how long this is going to last, but CIA arms for Syrian rebels have frozen amid infighting.
[00:12:45.917 --> 00:12:49.280]  Now this is, no official explanation is offered for the freeze.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.682]  This is coming from antiwar.com.
[00:12:50.702 --> 00:13:01.492]  They say sources are confirming that the CIA's long-standing arms smuggling program for quote-unquote moderate Syrian rebels has been frozen since earlier this month.
[00:13:01.932 --> 00:13:09.558]  With a move coinciding with the beginning of infighting between the Free Syrian Army and Al-Qaeda's Al-Nusra Front.
[00:13:09.898 --> 00:13:12.180]  And they talk about the fact that these guys are fighting each other.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.862]  Look, that's absolute nonsense.
[00:13:13.982 --> 00:13:17.985]  The real infighting is going on within the Pentagon and the CIA.
[00:13:18.025 --> 00:13:19.566]  They're the ones who started this war.
[00:13:19.606 --> 00:13:21.808]  They're the ones who are arming these rebels.
[00:13:21.848 --> 00:13:23.409]  There are no moderate rebels.
[00:13:23.549 --> 00:13:29.134]  These people, no matter what they want to call themselves, we see Al-Nusra has now become Al-Qaeda as well.
[00:13:29.734 --> 00:13:31.995]  They're just different aliases that they adopt.
[00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:33.756]  And we can go back and look at this.
[00:13:34.016 --> 00:13:43.480]  I wonder if this freezing of CIA shipments was due to Michael Flynn being there or if he didn't have a chance to have much of an effect there.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.161]  Now we're going back to December of 2015.
[00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:51.743]  Remember we had Seymour Hersh come out and talk about what was going on in Syria.
[00:13:52.123 --> 00:13:53.384]  He said the White House knew
[00:13:54.164 --> 00:13:54.885]  That the U.S.
[00:13:54.925 --> 00:13:56.386]  was arming the Islamic State.
[00:13:56.406 --> 00:13:59.147]  Of course, this is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh.
[00:13:59.508 --> 00:14:07.633]  He says that Obama, and in particular the CIA, knowingly armed militant Islamists in Syria, including the Islamic State.
[00:14:08.053 --> 00:14:23.624]  He said Obama's repeated insistence that Assad must leave office and that there are moderate rebel groups in Syria capable of defeating him has in recent years provoked quiet dissent, even overt opposition, among some of the most senior officers in the Pentagon's joint staff.
[00:14:24.424 --> 00:14:29.129]  And interestingly enough, when he's talking about this, he talks about General Flynn.
[00:14:29.529 --> 00:14:32.972]  And it was General Flynn who openly talked about this as well.
[00:14:33.412 --> 00:14:36.195]  That's one of the reasons we're so upset that he was removed.
[00:14:36.215 --> 00:14:43.982]  At least many of us who understand what's going on here, who understand that it is a CIA project to arm the rebels in Syria.
[00:14:45.023 --> 00:14:59.192]  But a highly classified 2013 Defense Intelligence Agency Joint Chief of Staff report on Syria forecast that the fall of the Assad regime would lead to chaos and possibly to Islamist extremists taking over Syria.
[00:14:59.532 --> 00:14:59.952]  Imagine!
[00:15:00.552 --> 00:15:01.353]  Can you imagine something?
[00:15:01.413 --> 00:15:02.253]  Well, of course we can.
[00:15:02.293 --> 00:15:03.694]  We've seen that happen in Iraq.
[00:15:03.734 --> 00:15:04.915]  We saw it happen in Libya.
[00:15:05.175 --> 00:15:07.657]  It happens every time they do this regime change.
[00:15:08.197 --> 00:15:11.358]  We always see things go from bad to far worse.
[00:15:11.918 --> 00:15:13.558]  Hirsch reported that Lt.
[00:15:13.758 --> 00:15:14.098]  Gen.
[00:15:14.178 --> 00:15:26.842]  Michael Flynn, director of the DIA between 2012 and 2014, told him that his agency sent a, quote, constant stream of warnings to the civilian leadership about the dire consequences of ousting Assad.
[00:15:27.442 --> 00:15:31.723]  And Hirsch quotes Flynn, saying, I felt they did not want to hear the truth.
[00:15:32.623 --> 00:15:36.244]  Now we've seen the CIA, working with the Washington Post,
[00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:43.545]  And of course, The Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, who has a massive contract, data contract, with the CIA.
[00:15:43.705 --> 00:15:45.626]  A $600 million contract three years ago.
[00:15:45.646 --> 00:15:47.567]  I don't know how large that contract is today.
[00:15:47.987 --> 00:15:48.908]  I'm sure it's much higher.
[00:15:49.568 --> 00:15:52.649]  Working together, they've now pushed General Flynn out.
[00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.151]  And we now have McMaster's taking his place.
[00:15:56.271 --> 00:15:59.833]  Now, McMaster's is a CFR member.
[00:15:59.893 --> 00:16:03.595]  He's part of the establishment, but he has also talked
[00:16:04.455 --> 00:16:05.576]  About Vietnam.
[00:16:05.616 --> 00:16:10.139]  He talked about the fact that civilian leadership was not listening to the military.
[00:16:10.179 --> 00:16:14.523]  The military was not doing their job in terms of telling them what was going on in Vietnam.
[00:16:14.623 --> 00:16:17.225]  Hopefully he will tell the truth.
[00:16:17.285 --> 00:16:19.366]  Hopefully he will move them in the right direction.
[00:16:19.386 --> 00:16:20.347]  But we'll have to wait and see.
[00:16:20.967 --> 00:16:23.289]  This could have been a coup.
[00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:25.331]  It certainly looks like it at this point.
[00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.412]  Against somebody who would tell the truth.
[00:16:27.652 --> 00:16:30.955]  Who would work against the CIA's secret war in Syria.
[00:16:32.213 --> 00:16:40.864]  Now the CNN, which we're going to find out more about tomorrow, is talking about, surprisingly, how Trump could change the fabric of the U.S.
[00:16:40.904 --> 00:16:42.166]  without changing its laws.
[00:16:42.266 --> 00:16:42.787]  Imagine that.
[00:16:43.467 --> 00:16:47.793]  Could a president change the fabric of society without changing its laws?
[00:16:47.813 --> 00:16:48.494]  Well, of course they could.
[00:16:48.534 --> 00:16:50.036]  We just saw Barack Obama do it.
[00:16:50.686 --> 00:16:56.608]  They say he's instructed the Department of Homeland Security to reinterpret the laws on immigration and to start building a border wall.
[00:16:57.148 --> 00:17:05.111]  He's told the State Department to reinterpret visas and refugees and HHS to reinterpret aspects of Obamacare.
[00:17:05.412 --> 00:17:06.692]  The EPA could be next.
[00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:07.993]  Yeah, you can bet it is.
[00:17:08.413 --> 00:17:09.613]  You can absolutely bet it is.
[00:17:09.913 --> 00:17:11.454]  Listen, what has happened here?
[00:17:12.014 --> 00:17:20.096]  We had Barack Obama say how many dozens of times early in his administration, hey, y'all want me to do something about immigration, but I'm not a dictator.
[00:17:20.156 --> 00:17:21.656]  I have to follow the laws.
[00:17:21.736 --> 00:17:23.897]  It's Congress that makes those laws, so forth and so on.
[00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:25.977]  But towards the end of his administration, he just did it.
[00:17:26.717 --> 00:17:28.018]  He just did it by executive order.
[00:17:28.498 --> 00:17:32.139]  So if he's going to do it by executive order, it can be undone by executive order.
[00:17:32.219 --> 00:17:33.279]  It was Barack Obama.
[00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:36.781]  Who changed the fabric of America.
[00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:39.143]  And of course CNN was cheering him on.
[00:17:39.463 --> 00:17:40.464]  Now they're afraid.
[00:17:40.924 --> 00:17:44.727]  They're afraid that we've got somebody that is going to operate by executive order.
[00:17:44.807 --> 00:17:46.248]  And we said this when it happened.
[00:17:46.888 --> 00:17:49.710]  We said the liberals need to understand where this is going.
[00:17:49.951 --> 00:17:54.134]  There's going to be a day where they're going to have a president that they don't agree with.
[00:17:54.154 --> 00:17:55.555]  Well that day has now come.
[00:17:56.271 --> 00:17:56.571]  I don't know.
[00:18:13.686 --> 00:18:15.467]  The Congress had been elected by the people.
[00:18:15.507 --> 00:18:17.027]  It wasn't the will of the people to do that.
[00:18:17.568 --> 00:18:22.149]  And the bureaucracy that creates the rules is the other aspect of the executive branch.
[00:18:22.189 --> 00:18:25.551]  It's not just executive orders, but it is the bureaucracy that has done this.
[00:18:26.031 --> 00:18:30.672]  And now this bureaucracy is going to see those rules change very quickly with the EPA.
[00:18:30.713 --> 00:18:36.175]  We're going to take a quick break, and when we come back, we're going to talk about two examples of this that have surfaced already.
[00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:41.517]  First, the transgender rules that we see coming up, and then we're going to talk about the EPA.
[00:18:41.637 --> 00:18:42.357]  We'll be right back.
[00:18:59.534 --> 00:19:01.135]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:02.062 --> 00:19:02.122]  The
[00:19:22.561 --> 00:19:30.784]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:30.924 --> 00:19:37.086]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:37.967 --> 00:19:39.807]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:40.808 --> 00:19:42.028]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:42.088 --> 00:19:43.068]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:43.088 --> 00:19:43.629]  They're unhappy.
[00:19:44.209 --> 00:19:45.189]  What is going on?
[00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:50.311]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.132]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:54.512 --> 00:19:56.234]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:19:56.414 --> 00:20:03.440]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:11.987]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:19.885]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:20.286 --> 00:20:23.689]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:23.749 --> 00:20:26.872]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[00:20:27.473 --> 00:20:32.558]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:20:33.078 --> 00:20:46.942]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[00:20:47.042 --> 00:20:48.482]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:48.922 --> 00:20:54.504]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:55.646 --> 00:20:58.568]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:20:59.108 --> 00:21:04.532]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:04.832 --> 00:21:14.298]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:14.558 --> 00:21:19.121]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:21.142]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:21.202 --> 00:21:23.982]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:24.262 --> 00:21:30.384]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[00:21:31.664 --> 00:21:40.407]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:44.968]  Three years in the making, incredible research, and the very best ingredients.
[00:21:45.488 --> 00:21:48.109]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.104]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:52.504 --> 00:21:55.908]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:21:59.383 --> 00:22:02.684]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:02.844 --> 00:22:05.104]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:05.264 --> 00:22:13.647]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:13.907 --> 00:22:17.267]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:17.407 --> 00:22:27.730]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate, non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.
[00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:35.335]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:35.515 --> 00:22:37.436]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:37.776 --> 00:22:45.341]  Super Mill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes, instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:45.721 --> 00:22:51.885]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:52.185 --> 00:22:59.109]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:08.985 --> 00:23:12.066]  Welcome back to this live edition of the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:23:12.146 --> 00:23:12.766]  I'm David Knight.
[00:23:13.367 --> 00:23:18.088]  And of course, this is our fundraiser that we're doing as part of our 13-hour live broadcast.
[00:23:18.128 --> 00:23:21.029]  We've seen Google's surrogate block our advertisement.
[00:23:21.489 --> 00:23:25.411]  We've seen videos with millions of views taken down in just the last week or so.
[00:23:25.491 --> 00:23:28.272]  And just last night, as I pointed out at the beginning of the broadcast,
[00:23:28.812 --> 00:23:43.400]  My report on censorship in Sweden and how the government there was suppressing information, threatening the police who blew the whistle on the massive crime wave that had been created by migrants there, that video itself was put onto an R restriction.
[00:23:44.437 --> 00:23:50.521]  So we're back with this live broadcast, and I hope if you're not a subscriber that you'll consider supporting our operation in that way.
[00:23:50.941 --> 00:23:53.263]  But take a look at the products that we have at Infowars Life.
[00:23:54.043 --> 00:23:57.565]  We have some great products, and it's not a political product.
[00:23:57.585 --> 00:23:58.886]  That's how we fund our operation.
[00:23:59.347 --> 00:24:01.688]  They have said you cannot have political ads.
[00:24:01.708 --> 00:24:02.629]  Well, they're not political ads.
[00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:07.512]  These are ads for supplements that they're now taking down from sites that are not political.
[00:24:08.412 --> 00:24:10.274]  But I want to talk about Trump's cabinet.
[00:24:10.919 --> 00:24:20.902]  And as I just mentioned in the last block, we've had General Flynn now been moved out of the cabinet, even though we've seen CIA armed shipments to ISIS being stopped now for the last month.
[00:24:21.282 --> 00:24:22.602]  Will those resume now?
[00:24:23.002 --> 00:24:24.603]  Is the CIA going to win with this?
[00:24:25.143 --> 00:24:32.665]  Also, very troubling, is news that Trump might be willing to remove Steve Bannon from the National Security Council.
[00:24:32.685 --> 00:24:33.845]  This came out of Fox News.
[00:24:34.185 --> 00:24:37.026]  White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said yesterday,
[00:24:37.586 --> 00:24:47.928]  But if President Trump's newly appointed National Security Advisor wanted to remove Chief Strategist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council's Principles Committee, the President would take that under serious consideration.
[00:24:48.489 --> 00:24:58.331]  See, the media is pushing for Steve Bannon to be taken out, just like they pushed to get David Petraeus in as Secretary of State or as National Security Advisor.
[00:24:59.071 --> 00:25:02.013]  It's not any question what the mainstream media wants.
[00:25:02.033 --> 00:25:08.157]  They say the president has made it clear to him that he's got full authority to structure the national security team the way he wants.
[00:25:08.217 --> 00:25:13.140]  So the media comes in and talks to the White House press secretary, putting that idea out there.
[00:25:13.481 --> 00:25:14.661]  Shouldn't we get Bannon out?
[00:25:14.681 --> 00:25:16.943]  And this is not the first time they've been attacking Bannon.
[00:25:16.963 --> 00:25:19.745]  Of course, the last couple of weeks, they've been all over him.
[00:25:20.225 --> 00:25:23.967]  We've seen a close-up image of him filling the cover of Time magazine.
[00:25:24.007 --> 00:25:31.612]  We've seen Saturday Night Live mocking him, but also setting him up as if he was a real power in the White House.
[00:25:32.273 --> 00:25:35.275]  Now, we've had strong advisors to former presidents.
[00:25:35.335 --> 00:25:38.056]  We had Henry Kissinger with Richard Nixon.
[00:25:38.076 --> 00:25:40.958]  We had Zbigniew Brzezinski with Jimmy Carter.
[00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:43.080]  They talked a lot about those people.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.601]  They admired them because, of course, they were globalists.
[00:25:45.661 --> 00:25:49.504]  But they never used them to try to diminish the president.
[00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:54.954]  Now they're doing that with Steve Bannon, because this is the way the globalists roll.
[00:25:55.394 --> 00:26:03.817]  We even had Daily Mail say, Steve Bannon is obsessed with a book that is arguing that institutions are destroyed and rebuilt every 80 years.
[00:26:04.677 --> 00:26:09.159]  And I saw that and I thought, well that's really interesting, because I know exactly that book they're talking about, The Fourth Turning.
[00:26:09.479 --> 00:26:13.141]  One of the first reports I did when I came here to InfoWars was to talk about that book.
[00:26:13.201 --> 00:26:16.422]  It's a very interesting thesis about history.
[00:26:17.102 --> 00:26:23.744]  These two historians, Strauss and Howe, go back about 500 years over American, English, European history.
[00:26:23.784 --> 00:26:26.265]  They take a look at a generational cycle.
[00:26:26.285 --> 00:26:29.006]  You know, history doesn't repeat itself, but it really does rhyme.
[00:26:29.046 --> 00:26:31.367]  And they see a rhythm to that rhyme.
[00:26:31.427 --> 00:26:40.510]  I want to play for you this report because it's very interesting and it shows how important and what a strategic thinker Bannon is and why they want to get rid of him.
[00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:43.531]  Here's that report about this book that they're saying he's obsessed with.
[00:26:44.215 --> 00:26:50.178]  Now, this quote was written nine years before the financial crisis of 2008, but it came from a book that was written in 1990.
[00:26:50.318 --> 00:26:56.021]  It had the same ideas from the same authors, 18 years before the financial crisis.
[00:26:56.322 --> 00:27:00.804]  The fourth turning is due to begin shortly after the new millennium, midway through the 00 decade.
[00:27:01.616 --> 00:27:05.419]  About the year 2005, a sudden spark will catalyze a crisis mood.
[00:27:05.759 --> 00:27:07.821]  Remnants of the old social order will disintegrate.
[00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:10.143]  Political and economic trust will implode.
[00:27:10.443 --> 00:27:17.389]  Real hardship will beset the land with severe distress that could involve questions of class, race, nation, and empire.
[00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:20.011]  The very survival of the nation will feel at stake.
[00:27:20.925 --> 00:27:32.210]  Sometime before the year 2025, America will pass through a great gate in history commensurate with the American Revolution, Civil War, and twin emergencies of the Great Depression and World War II.
[00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:40.753]  The basis of this prediction is a cyclical view of history that Strauss and Howe discovered by going back through American and English history back to the mid-1400s.
[00:27:40.833 --> 00:27:45.975]  And they discovered that just as we have seasons of weather, we have seasons of society.
[00:27:46.827 --> 00:27:56.949]  And just as we don't know the exact date that winter is going to come, or whether it's going to be a harsh or mild winter, we do know that it's going to follow fall, and we do know the approximate time that it's going to come.
[00:27:57.229 --> 00:28:10.672]  We take a close look at the rhythms of American history, and in our book we make the following big prediction, that beginning about ten years from now, America is due to enter an era of crisis, an era of political and social upheaval,
[00:28:11.852 --> 00:28:15.033]  That will last around 20 years or so until the late 2020s.
[00:28:17.193 --> 00:28:22.975]  We call this era a fourth turning, and we think it's going to be a big threshold for the history of our nation.
[00:28:23.415 --> 00:28:35.738]  It's going to be something on par with World War II and the Great Depression, or going back the length of a human lifespan before then, the Civil War, going back the length of another human lifespan, the American Revolution.
[00:28:36.438 --> 00:28:40.603]  It could be a time of tragedy or a time of great opportunity.
[00:28:40.723 --> 00:28:46.849]  What they found was that societies will go through four phases of high, awakening, unraveling, and crisis.
[00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.491]  Humans go through four phases of life.
[00:28:49.712 --> 00:28:52.614]  Childhood, young adult, midlife, and elderhood.
[00:28:53.095 --> 00:28:58.080]  And they noticed generations where people have shared experiences and attitudes are spaced about 20 years apart.
[00:28:58.866 --> 00:29:03.210]  And generations are shaped by where their childhood falls within the phases of society.
[00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:11.617]  Now this got my attention because I noticed there was a repeating pattern of about 72 years between significant dates in American history as well as some other histories.
[00:29:11.897 --> 00:29:14.359]  For example, if you go from the time the U.S.
[00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:19.603]  Constitution was written in 1789 to the beginning of the Civil War 1861, that's 72 years.
[00:29:20.264 --> 00:29:26.729]  Another 72 years takes us to 1933, the beginning of the New Deal, another major transformation of American society.
[00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:34.719]  If you go another 72 years, that took us to about 2005, exactly where Strauss and Howe had predicted a major crisis and change would occur.
[00:29:35.239 --> 00:29:41.745]  And in addition, if you look at the Russian Revolution, from 1917 to 1989 was about 72 years.
[00:29:42.186 --> 00:29:44.548]  So it seemed to fit with a life cycle of humans.
[00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:51.094]  In a cycle, four generations, 20 years apart, are shaped by when their childhood falls within that cycle.
[00:29:51.684 --> 00:29:55.986]  And the names they use in their book, The Fourth Turning, come from the biblical account of Exodus.
[00:29:56.346 --> 00:29:58.768]  For example, you have one generation as a prophet generation.
[00:29:59.388 --> 00:30:02.029]  Now think of Moses calling a generation to change.
[00:30:02.409 --> 00:30:08.653]  The next generation, the nomad generation, wandering in the wilderness, a period of crisis and restlessness.
[00:30:09.493 --> 00:30:11.474]  The following generation will be a hero generation.
[00:30:11.534 --> 00:30:14.396]  Think of the Joshua generation, taking a promised land.
[00:30:14.876 --> 00:30:16.737]  That often involves a major war.
[00:30:16.757 --> 00:30:19.058]  And then finally, an artist generation.
[00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.452]  The generation that builds a new society.
[00:30:22.253 --> 00:30:24.956]  Well, where does Strauss and Howe think that we are in this cycle?
[00:30:25.476 --> 00:30:31.823]  The researchers see the millennial generation, those born between 1982 to 2004, as the hero generation.
[00:30:32.624 --> 00:30:42.434]  And they see our society entering a fourth turning, a crisis period where society will be fundamentally transformed as it was with the American Revolution, the Civil War, or the New Deal.
[00:30:43.228 --> 00:30:47.710]  And the last time we faced a fourth turning was the Great Depression and World War II.
[00:30:48.331 --> 00:30:51.673]  Straus and Howe's predictions of 22 years ago now look prescient.
[00:30:52.493 --> 00:30:58.996]  And we can see the storm surge coming in our society at our time, just as if a hurricane was approaching the shore.
[00:30:59.016 --> 00:31:03.719]  Now our government has been undermining the foundations of liberty for a long time.
[00:31:04.443 --> 00:31:14.305]  And the question is, will you be a sandbag to help hold up and protect liberty, or will you stand by as it gets swept away and we enter a new dark age of authoritarianism?
[00:31:15.205 --> 00:31:17.606]  I'm David Knight for the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:31:18.846 --> 00:31:23.067]  Now that's a report that I did about four years ago, and of course Steve Bannon understands what this is about.
[00:31:23.107 --> 00:31:25.408]  Do you really think that this is coming true, or do you think that's a bunch of baloney?
[00:31:25.448 --> 00:31:27.348]  Do you see the people talking about secession?
[00:31:28.007 --> 00:31:30.069]  Do you see the talk about a greater depression?
[00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:35.113]  When Elon Musk says we're going to have 50% of the people lose their job, to actually, he only said 15%.
[00:31:36.314 --> 00:31:39.476]  But Oxford and other people who have looked at this have said, conservatively, it'll be 50%.
[00:31:39.616 --> 00:31:43.239]  In China, 77% unemployment.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.984]  During the Great Depression, we had 25% unemployment peak in the United States.
[00:31:49.004 --> 00:31:50.245]  But now we're looking at twice that.
[00:31:50.585 --> 00:31:52.247]  Three times that in China.
[00:31:52.267 --> 00:31:53.368]  You think that's going to make a change?
[00:31:53.988 --> 00:31:55.069]  You think people are upset now?
[00:31:55.590 --> 00:32:02.636]  And of course, when they're looking at this, they always talk about how there would be a grey champion that would be emerging out of the baby boom generation about this time.
[00:32:02.956 --> 00:32:05.118]  And of course, people have looked at people like Ron Paul.
[00:32:05.178 --> 00:32:05.738]  Is he the guy?
[00:32:06.179 --> 00:32:06.799]  Bernie Sanders.
[00:32:06.859 --> 00:32:07.420]  Is he the guy?
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:08.761]  Or is it Donald Trump?
[00:32:09.322 --> 00:32:11.524]  Are we going to have a libertarian, a socialist, a populist?
[00:32:11.584 --> 00:32:12.244]  Who's it going to be?
[00:32:12.304 --> 00:32:13.926]  Well, we're going to talk about when we come back.
[00:32:14.326 --> 00:32:16.067]  We're going to talk about the moves towards secession.
[00:32:16.447 --> 00:32:26.913]  We're even in North Carolina now, not just in California, but in North Carolina there's been a bill to allow the state's constitution to be changed to allow secession.
[00:32:27.393 --> 00:32:29.074]  This is the environment that we're living in.
[00:32:29.214 --> 00:32:33.836]  This is why it is so essential that we keep the lines of communication open.
[00:32:34.277 --> 00:32:38.299]  The mainstream media, people like Brzezinski, they want to control what you think.
[00:32:38.991 --> 00:32:40.271]  We want you to think.
[00:32:40.511 --> 00:32:42.312]  We want to give you the information to think.
[00:32:42.572 --> 00:32:51.014]  That's why it is essential for us to keep this line of communication open as Google tries to shut down our ads, tries to purge our videos, restrict our videos.
[00:32:51.254 --> 00:32:51.714]  Stay with us.
[00:32:51.914 --> 00:32:52.794]  We're going to be right back.
[00:32:57.876 --> 00:33:07.398]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:08.387 --> 00:33:10.268]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:11.028 --> 00:33:14.369]  Why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsTore.com?
[00:33:14.749 --> 00:33:16.989]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:18.130]  And it's simple.
[00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:23.811]  I will only promote, and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:25.292]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:25.352 --> 00:33:28.133]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:28.193 --> 00:33:30.073]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:30.693 --> 00:33:36.095]  National Defense Labs, and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:36.955 --> 00:33:47.243]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people the true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:48.004 --> 00:33:55.029]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:58.572]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:33:58.612 --> 00:34:01.034]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:01.054 --> 00:34:05.057]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:05.497 --> 00:34:06.298]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:07.401 --> 00:34:10.063]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:10.664 --> 00:34:21.673]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:21.733 --> 00:34:23.334]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:23.935 --> 00:34:25.456]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:33.143]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:33.903 --> 00:34:36.245]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:36.685 --> 00:34:39.046]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:39.306 --> 00:34:45.530]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:59.038]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:34:59.438 --> 00:35:00.239]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:00.579 --> 00:35:01.520]  Made in America.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.382]  Exclusively available at Infowarsstore.com right now.
[00:35:04.462 --> 00:35:05.243]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:05.303 --> 00:35:06.224]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:07.945]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:07.965 --> 00:35:08.606]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:08.626 --> 00:35:09.086]  You can wear it.
[00:35:09.147 --> 00:35:09.707]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:09.767 --> 00:35:10.568]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:10.588 --> 00:35:12.910]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:20.977]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:21.657 --> 00:35:25.339]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:32.123]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:32.184 --> 00:35:33.524]  What did they really say about this?
[00:35:33.544 --> 00:35:34.565]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:34.725 --> 00:35:37.547]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:38.327 --> 00:35:42.070]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:46.293]  Because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:46.793 --> 00:35:51.816]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:35:51.897 --> 00:35:59.322]  And 90, I mean you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in conviction of a crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:35:59.342 --> 00:36:00.562]  This stops that unless it's a slug.
[00:36:01.443 --> 00:36:02.143]  That's amazing.
[00:36:02.203 --> 00:36:05.404]  So they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:06.945]  And soon, they won't have it.
[00:36:07.305 --> 00:36:08.945]  If it's available to civilians, they're not sure.
[00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:11.646]  We're going to have the stuff that's unstoppable.
[00:36:11.846 --> 00:36:15.887]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:16.727 --> 00:36:20.048]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:20.068 --> 00:36:20.809]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:21.149 --> 00:36:22.169]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:22.229 --> 00:36:23.949]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:27.390]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:30.686 --> 00:36:33.168]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:33.749 --> 00:36:35.470]  Again, fund The Info War.
[00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.714]  Get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:40.194 --> 00:36:42.236]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:42.576 --> 00:36:42.236]  $200.
[00:36:42.817 --> 00:36:45.779]  Go check out all their different products at infowarrestore.com.
[00:36:45.839 --> 00:36:46.540]  It's amazing.
[00:36:53.968 --> 00:36:56.309]  Welcome back to this live edition of the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:36:56.369 --> 00:37:07.591]  I'm David Knight, and as we were talking in the last segment about Steve Bannon, about the book that he's been derided about, The Fourth Turning, looking at this moment in history that is so important.
[00:37:07.632 --> 00:37:08.452]  He understands that.
[00:37:08.572 --> 00:37:12.773]  You need to understand that we are truly at a crisis moment.
[00:37:13.573 --> 00:37:18.779]  The characters for crisis in Chinese are the combination of danger and opportunity.
[00:37:19.119 --> 00:37:20.241]  And that's precisely where we are.
[00:37:20.561 --> 00:37:28.850]  Steve Bannon said we have a point right now where if we deliver, if the Trump administration delivers, we can change society for a generation.
[00:37:29.731 --> 00:37:30.512]  Let me make it clear.
[00:37:30.552 --> 00:37:33.054]  There are major changes that are coming down the pike.
[00:37:33.074 --> 00:37:35.896]  You don't have to look at the fourth turning to understand that.
[00:37:35.936 --> 00:37:42.822]  We've had the globalists talking about all these revolutionary disruptive changes that are going to be happening between 2020 and 2030 for a long time.
[00:37:43.323 --> 00:37:47.246]  We've got the 2030 agenda for sustainability coming from the United Nations.
[00:37:47.346 --> 00:37:51.529]  We had Agenda 21, but then they put a specific time point on it, 2030.
[00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:55.012]  We've got self-driving cars that are going to take over our transportation.
[00:37:55.032 --> 00:38:00.056]  That's all part of that sustainability, that part of that Agenda 21 to try to confine us into the cities.
[00:38:00.657 --> 00:38:03.399]  They're looking at massive disruption in the employment market.
[00:38:03.699 --> 00:38:05.481]  They're looking at a universal basic income.
[00:38:05.581 --> 00:38:06.982]  This is an important time.
[00:38:07.503 --> 00:38:08.563]  This is why.
[00:38:09.284 --> 00:38:13.927]  They're now moving, cutting their own economic throat to try to deny us these ads.
[00:38:14.027 --> 00:38:15.629]  It's not in their economic interest to do this.
[00:38:15.869 --> 00:38:16.789]  They're trying to punish us.
[00:38:16.809 --> 00:38:23.214]  They're trying to take down and are taking down our videos, putting our videos on restricted release, as well as blocking our ads.
[00:38:23.274 --> 00:38:24.635]  That's why this is so important.
[00:38:24.975 --> 00:38:26.336]  That's why I talked about Steve Bannon.
[00:38:26.677 --> 00:38:27.958]  That's why it is important.
[00:38:28.638 --> 00:38:38.465]  This press conference where the media is pushing this notion to the White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer saying, can't we get rid of Steve Bannon now that we got a new security advisor?
[00:38:38.525 --> 00:38:39.385]  Can't we get rid of him now?
[00:38:39.765 --> 00:38:42.087]  See, they could get a two-for-one by getting rid of Mike Flynn.
[00:38:42.447 --> 00:38:50.473]  Mike Flynn, who blew the whistle on our government, our CIA, arming Al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria.
[00:38:51.153 --> 00:38:51.814]  That's what they want to do.
[00:38:51.834 --> 00:38:55.156]  Now they want to get rid of the guy who is there, who knew this was coming.
[00:38:55.196 --> 00:38:57.797]  And there's an interesting article that just came out last week from Vice.
[00:38:58.958 --> 00:39:01.279]  Quoting Steve Bannon, saying the world is on fire.
[00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.759]  And this was two years before his rise to power.
[00:39:03.799 --> 00:39:08.620]  This guy said, well, back in September 2014, I went to his house for a party.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:12.301]  He was on assignment from Rolling Stone to report about Breitbart.
[00:39:12.341 --> 00:39:15.921]  And he was given an invitation to a place that was called the Breitbart Embassy.
[00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:19.742]  He said, when I went there, I asked him, why do you call this place the Embassy?
[00:39:20.282 --> 00:39:21.082]  And Bannon said, D.C.
[00:39:21.122 --> 00:39:22.003]  is like Saigon in 68.
[00:39:22.483 --> 00:39:23.803]  You don't know who your friends are.
[00:39:24.523 --> 00:39:25.744]  And who your enemies are.
[00:39:25.904 --> 00:39:29.688]  Well, it's starting to become clear, and I hope that he's got a better read on that now.
[00:39:29.728 --> 00:39:38.035]  But it's interesting, at this party, this guy said, well, I didn't recognize many people there, but there was Laura Ingraham, there was Senator Jeff Sessions, there was Nigel Farage.
[00:39:38.095 --> 00:39:39.356]  He'd never heard of this guy before.
[00:39:39.376 --> 00:39:42.619]  He said Nigel Farage got up in a typical Nigel Farage style.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:47.063]  He referred to then Prime Minister David Cameron as chinless and gutless.
[00:39:48.304 --> 00:39:49.645]  That's such a great order.
[00:39:50.085 --> 00:39:51.546]  He just really nails it.
[00:39:51.826 --> 00:40:03.753]  And then he talks about his private dinner with Steve Bannon, who said there is a center-right population throughout the world that is anti-establishment, that is anti-the party of Davos.
[00:40:04.114 --> 00:40:11.018]  And just think about Ted Malik, who has now been tipped to be Donald Trump's ambassador to the European Union.
[00:40:11.778 --> 00:40:16.800]  Who wrote the book, Davos, Aspen, and Yale, My Life Behind the Elite Curtain.
[00:40:17.241 --> 00:40:27.626]  And he pointed out the fact that we very much want to have bilateral relations with countries in Europe, but we do not want to strengthen a multilateral, globalist organization.
[00:40:28.306 --> 00:40:36.528]  Like the European Union, which is a stepping stone to Brzezinski's trilateral vision of the world, which in itself is a stepping stone to a one-world government.
[00:40:36.789 --> 00:40:41.870]  Now, if you don't think that all this stuff is happening, just look at all the talk about secession.
[00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:46.271]  And of course, it has always been pooh-poohed by people on the right.
[00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:51.633]  They say, oh, this is nothing but racism, and yet we see this happening quite a bit, don't we, in California, and they're not
[00:40:52.713 --> 00:40:57.237]  Putting this down, but I want to take a look at a new article that was up on Drudge today.
[00:40:57.778 --> 00:41:03.443]  North Carolina's constitutional ban on secession could be dropped under a House bill that has been introduced.
[00:41:03.483 --> 00:41:05.305]  And I want you to hear this language.
[00:41:06.005 --> 00:41:07.987]  This is in the North Carolina Constitution.
[00:41:08.007 --> 00:41:11.250]  Of course, it was not the way the North Carolina Constitution was originally.
[00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:15.554]  That's part of the 13 states that created a federal government.
[00:41:15.934 --> 00:41:20.978]  Later on, they decided they wanted to leave the thing that they had created, just like one day we're going to leave the United Nations.
[00:41:21.018 --> 00:41:22.099]  That's going to happen, folks.
[00:41:22.779 --> 00:41:23.660]  And be prepared.
[00:41:24.121 --> 00:41:25.822]  They're going to come after us when it happens.
[00:41:26.162 --> 00:41:31.486]  They're going to call us bad things, like secessionists and rebels, which is what they called the Southerners.
[00:41:31.546 --> 00:41:32.747]  They didn't call them racist.
[00:41:32.907 --> 00:41:34.949]  No, you won't find any of that talk there.
[00:41:35.229 --> 00:41:36.310]  They didn't call them slave owners.
[00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:37.471]  They called them secesh.
[00:41:37.511 --> 00:41:38.372]  That was a thing they didn't like.
[00:41:38.412 --> 00:41:41.074]  And when they won the war, they rewrote the Constitution and put this in it.
[00:41:41.494 --> 00:41:44.856]  This state shall ever remain a member of the American Union.
[00:41:45.216 --> 00:41:46.937]  The people thereof are part of the American nation.
[00:41:46.977 --> 00:41:59.485]  There is no right on the part of this state to secede and all attempts from whatever source or upon whatever pretext to dissolve this union or to sever this nation shall be resisted with the whole power of the state.
[00:41:59.565 --> 00:42:03.448]  I want you to look at that in contrast to the Declaration of Independence.
[00:42:03.468 --> 00:42:10.032]  You understand that our country was founded on the right of self-government, on the right of secession.
[00:42:11.024 --> 00:42:12.946]  It was a Declaration of Independence, wasn't it?
[00:42:13.486 --> 00:42:21.112]  They said we hold these truths to be self-evident, that we have these rights that we get from God, that we create government to enforce those rights.
[00:42:21.252 --> 00:42:31.220]  And when that government becomes destructive of those rights, we have the right and the duty to alter or abolish that government and set up new governments that are going to respect our rights.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.241]  That was what this was about.
[00:42:33.661 --> 00:42:34.762]  That's what the Civil War was about.
[00:42:34.802 --> 00:42:37.184]  That was what the Revolutionary War was about.
[00:42:37.204 --> 00:42:40.627]  And we had an article yesterday on Infowars from Lou Rockwell.
[00:42:41.567 --> 00:42:43.128]  And he said, let's break up the USA.
[00:42:43.888 --> 00:42:44.708]  And he made this case.
[00:42:44.748 --> 00:42:51.971]  He said, everyone takes for granted that it's normal for a country of 320 million to be dictated to by a single central authority.
[00:42:52.011 --> 00:42:58.434]  The only debate we're permitted to have is who will be selected to carry out this grotesque, inhumane function.
[00:42:58.454 --> 00:42:59.534]  Who's our dictator going to be?
[00:42:59.574 --> 00:43:01.915]  We have an election every year to decide who the dictator is going to be.
[00:43:02.175 --> 00:43:03.156]  And remember, I said that earlier.
[00:43:03.756 --> 00:43:05.857]  I said, the left is not happy now.
[00:43:06.077 --> 00:43:09.858]  We told them, we warned them when Barack Obama started acting as a dictator.
[00:43:09.898 --> 00:43:10.939]  We said, he's setting a precedent.
[00:43:11.559 --> 00:43:13.719]  Future presidents will follow that precedent.
[00:43:14.139 --> 00:43:14.880]  And now we're seeing it.
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.800]  He said, here's the debate we should be having instead.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:21.321]  What if we simply abandoned the quixotic mission and went our separate ways?
[00:43:21.801 --> 00:43:23.121]  It's an idea that's gaining traction.
[00:43:23.381 --> 00:43:25.281]  Much too late to be sure, but better late than never.
[00:43:25.601 --> 00:43:29.982]  For a long time, it seemed as if the idea of secession was unlikely to take hold in modern America.
[00:43:30.302 --> 00:43:33.763]  Schoolchildren, after all, were told to associate secession with slavery and treason.
[00:43:34.283 --> 00:43:36.983]  Think about the Pledge of Allegiance, okay?
[00:43:37.003 --> 00:43:37.704]  What does it say?
[00:43:38.844 --> 00:43:39.304]  One nation.
[00:43:39.624 --> 00:43:40.184]  Indivisible.
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:43.182]  The Under God wasn't added until the 1950s.
[00:43:43.382 --> 00:43:45.985]  The pledge was created during Reconstruction.
[00:43:46.485 --> 00:43:49.408]  And when they did the pledge, they held their arm out in a Nazi salute.
[00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:53.312]  It was only after the Nazis started using it in the 1930s that they put their hand over their heart.
[00:43:53.953 --> 00:43:57.537]  This was a pledge to a government, not a pledge to principles.
[00:43:57.577 --> 00:44:00.219]  It was not a pledge to the Constitution or to the Bill of Rights.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.862]  It was a pledge to an authority.
[00:44:03.683 --> 00:44:03.923]  Now he says,
[00:44:21.516 --> 00:44:26.261]  Today, about one in three Californians polled favors the Golden State secession from the Union.
[00:44:26.381 --> 00:44:27.423]  They have an organization.
[00:44:27.843 --> 00:44:29.024]  YesCalifornia.org.
[00:44:29.325 --> 00:44:33.429]  And I just want to promote that and say, what can I do to help you leave?
[00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:40.317]  Because one of the things that allows me to pursue my own self-government is if you'll leave me alone, we can do this peacefully.
[00:44:40.557 --> 00:44:42.099]  This has happened throughout Scandinavia.
[00:44:42.159 --> 00:44:46.765]  We had Norway and Sweden go their separate ways, and of course Finland was part of that at one point in time.
[00:44:46.785 --> 00:44:48.347]  They've had Denmark as part of it.
[00:44:48.387 --> 00:44:51.552]  They've decided at various times to peacefully separate and go their own way.
[00:44:51.572 --> 00:44:53.554]  You don't have to have a war.
[00:44:54.255 --> 00:44:55.537]  We saw this with Czechoslovakia.
[00:44:57.469 --> 00:44:59.570]  Broke into the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
[00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:02.352]  It can happen, but frequently it doesn't.
[00:45:02.392 --> 00:45:11.737]  If we look at Ukraine, of course, we see in Ukraine they decide they would leave Russia, but then they denied the right of secession to the Crimeans, who had always been a part of Russia as well.
[00:45:12.137 --> 00:45:17.660]  So that's the duplicity that we see with the left, even as they're now saying they want to leave as part of California.
[00:45:18.021 --> 00:45:21.603]  They say, many have adopted the creepy slogan, not my president.
[00:45:21.643 --> 00:45:23.083]  This is Lou Rockwell talking.
[00:45:23.123 --> 00:45:23.924]  He says, in other words,
[00:45:24.364 --> 00:45:34.973]  I may not want this particular person having the power to intervene in all aspects of my life and holding in his hands the ability to destroy the entire earth, but I most certainly do want someone else to have that power.
[00:45:35.653 --> 00:45:35.873]  Really?
[00:45:35.893 --> 00:45:37.074]  Do you really want that?
[00:45:37.635 --> 00:45:38.696]  Think about this for a moment.
[00:45:38.776 --> 00:45:48.583]  This is a point at which we could have the left and right come together and say, let's decide about how we're going to govern ourselves instead of fighting over who's going to be the dictator.
[00:45:49.344 --> 00:45:56.124]  And I want to take a look at the fight that is going on right now within the Trump administration just on transgender bathrooms.
[00:45:57.096 --> 00:45:58.036]  And we're going to talk about that.
[00:45:58.056 --> 00:46:01.138]  I've only got about a minute I just heard in my ear before we got to go to break.
[00:46:01.518 --> 00:46:14.383]  We're going to talk about the civil war, not only within the GOP, but the civil war within the Trump administration between Senator Sessions, who is now Attorney General, and between Betsy DeVos, who is now head of the Department of Education.
[00:46:14.703 --> 00:46:24.307]  You would think it would be a non-fight that we would say that the federal government doesn't have the authority to dictate how and where we're going to go to the bathroom, wouldn't you?
[00:46:25.165 --> 00:46:27.948]  But no, not even in the Trump administration.
[00:46:27.968 --> 00:46:36.078]  We had to get Donald Trump involved in this fight, and we're going to tell you how it turned out, and we're also going to talk about the EPA in terms of remaking society.
[00:46:36.439 --> 00:46:37.981]  Stay with us, we're going to be right back.
[00:46:38.601 --> 00:46:43.387]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:46:44.068 --> 00:46:45.649]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:46:46.029 --> 00:46:51.013]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:46:51.373 --> 00:46:56.837]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:46:57.217 --> 00:47:03.821]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:04.462 --> 00:47:05.603]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:06.463 --> 00:47:08.404]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:08.724 --> 00:47:11.686]  But most people are just efficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:12.126 --> 00:47:15.748]  You gotta have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:15.928 --> 00:47:18.489]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:18.549 --> 00:47:30.895]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:31.095 --> 00:47:36.216]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities, and it's tainted.
[00:47:36.336 --> 00:47:37.676]  It's bound.
[00:47:37.957 --> 00:47:38.957]  It's not absorbable.
[00:47:39.357 --> 00:47:43.938]  I tried it, and I had incredible effects, even with dirty iodine, because the body needs it.
[00:47:44.158 --> 00:47:49.059]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:47:49.539 --> 00:47:54.440]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:55.680]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.421]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle.
[00:47:58.581 --> 00:47:58.901]  Of course!
[00:48:21.425 --> 00:48:24.065]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:24.085 --> 00:48:25.106]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:25.426 --> 00:48:26.146]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:26.186 --> 00:48:26.786]  You must have it.
[00:48:27.146 --> 00:48:34.687]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:34.707 --> 00:48:35.587]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:35.607 --> 00:48:37.028]  888-253-3139.
[00:48:37.628 --> 00:48:41.748]  Welcome back to this live edition of the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:48:41.828 --> 00:48:50.510]  I'm David Knight and of course we're doing a 13-hour broadcast because Google's surrogate, Adroll, has informed us that they will no longer allow our ads to go out.
[00:48:51.055 --> 00:48:54.719]  And as I reported earlier in the broadcast, they're taking down our videos with millions of views.
[00:48:54.739 --> 00:48:56.041]  They're putting some of them as restricted.
[00:48:56.101 --> 00:48:56.581]  Why is it?
[00:48:56.982 --> 00:48:58.663]  It's because we are at a crossroads.
[00:48:58.683 --> 00:48:59.464]  We're at a turning point.
[00:48:59.504 --> 00:49:03.308]  This is something that the globalists have been working towards for a long time.
[00:49:03.369 --> 00:49:05.631]  The 2020 to 2030 timeframe.
[00:49:05.651 --> 00:49:08.995]  They've had so many disruptive things that they want to do in this timeframe.
[00:49:09.727 --> 00:49:10.568]  Many of us see it.
[00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:11.830]  We're trying to wake you up.
[00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:13.352]  We're not trying to control your minds.
[00:49:13.372 --> 00:49:15.054]  We're trying to awaken your minds.
[00:49:15.074 --> 00:49:16.176]  We're trying to inform you.
[00:49:16.716 --> 00:49:18.258]  That's why they're shutting us down.
[00:49:18.659 --> 00:49:24.146]  And I want to talk about this civil war that is developing, not only in terms of people talking about secession,
[00:49:24.947 --> 00:49:29.128]  Not only in North Carolina, but in California and other places, we're seeing this increasing talk.
[00:49:29.148 --> 00:49:32.269]  We're seeing a civil war that is developing in the streets.
[00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:34.549]  We're also seeing a civil war in Congress.
[00:49:34.589 --> 00:49:37.950]  We see the GOP fighting so much they won't get anything done.
[00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:47.232]  And even within the Trump administration, even on something as innocuous as stopping this insane transgender bathroom lunacy, we have a fight.
[00:49:47.952 --> 00:49:49.854]  With the people that Donald Trump himself just picked.
[00:49:49.914 --> 00:49:55.919]  Of course, he's got Attorney General Sessions and then the Department of Education Supervisor Betsy DeVos.
[00:49:55.939 --> 00:49:56.880]  First of all, what has happened?
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:02.365]  Daily Caller reports that Trump readies reversal of the transgender bathroom lunacy in the public schools.
[00:50:02.385 --> 00:50:13.534]  They say Trump's administration appears poised to overturn this vague Obama administration order that allows transgender students in America's taxpayer-funded schools to use bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice.
[00:50:14.355 --> 00:50:21.400]  White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer suggested yesterday that Trump will abandon Obama's transgender bathroom mandate.
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:23.821]  He said this is a state's rights issue.
[00:50:24.262 --> 00:50:25.603]  It is not one for the federal government.
[00:50:25.703 --> 00:50:26.603]  He's absolutely right.
[00:50:27.023 --> 00:50:33.408]  Regardless of what you think about the bathroom issue, this is not the authority of the federal government.
[00:50:34.073 --> 00:50:39.896]  First of all, it's a very bad idea to have this kind of micromanagement from the federal government about anything.
[00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:41.337]  Why would you ever want to have that?
[00:50:41.917 --> 00:50:47.680]  And as we pointed out earlier, do you really want to have one dictator and then four years later we get a different dictator who changes all the rules?
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.061]  We don't want to have that.
[00:50:49.121 --> 00:50:52.162]  We want to be able to have some continuity and some sanity in our lives.
[00:50:52.642 --> 00:50:57.823]  We want to be able to control our lives at a local level, not send everything to Washington.
[00:50:57.843 --> 00:51:03.604]  But of course, under the Constitution that gives them authority, they have no authority to do this.
[00:51:03.904 --> 00:51:11.006]  They have no authority to dictate what the bathroom rules are, any more than they have any authority to throw people in jail for selling and using drugs.
[00:51:12.096 --> 00:51:14.737]  We had to have an amendment to the Constitution to prohibit alcohol.
[00:51:15.037 --> 00:51:17.298]  Where is the amendment to prohibit any of this stuff?
[00:51:17.738 --> 00:51:23.101]  Where did they overthrow the idea that we have to actually have due process before they can take our property?
[00:51:23.701 --> 00:51:27.583]  But of course, conservatives have fallen in line behind civil asset forfeiture.
[00:51:28.433 --> 00:51:33.335]  And they have said, that's fine, you don't have any property rights if we say it's in the best interest of the drug war.
[00:51:33.375 --> 00:51:34.175]  Let me tell you something.
[00:51:34.915 --> 00:51:37.736]  If you don't own property, you are the property.
[00:51:38.116 --> 00:51:39.136]  You are the property.
[00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:41.557]  You are a slave if you're not allowed to own property.
[00:51:41.797 --> 00:51:50.860]  If you revoke our rights to due process, if you say you can take my property without ever even charging me with a crime, charging the property with a crime, we are slaves.
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:53.121]  But let's go back to this transgender issue.
[00:51:53.201 --> 00:51:53.701]  It is not
[00:51:54.381 --> 00:51:55.161]  A federal issue.
[00:51:55.181 --> 00:51:57.422]  There is no authority for the federal government to do this.
[00:51:57.442 --> 00:52:02.525]  And I don't care if you want to go back to the Commerce Clause or you want to talk about the General Welfare Clause.
[00:52:03.365 --> 00:52:05.986]  That was something that was in the Constitution from the very beginning.
[00:52:06.326 --> 00:52:11.328]  James Madison and the others who put in the Bill of Rights said we are concerned that there might be some wiggle room in here.
[00:52:11.368 --> 00:52:16.531]  We want to make it abundantly clear that they do not have the authority under the 9th and 10th Amendment.
[00:52:16.551 --> 00:52:20.732]  They said you do not have the authority unless it is expressly given to you to do something.
[00:52:20.792 --> 00:52:21.393]  That's why
[00:52:22.153 --> 00:52:24.774]  They created an amendment to prohibit alcohol.
[00:52:25.135 --> 00:52:26.655]  But we don't have that kind of government anymore.
[00:52:26.735 --> 00:52:34.920]  We have a government that uses the Constitution merely as window dressing and then when they become, when they get elected to office, they wipe their rear end with it.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:40.863]  So now they're telling us how we can and where we can wipe our rear ends in terms of transgender bathrooms.
[00:52:41.383 --> 00:52:45.349]  They say Trump's policy is worlds apart from the Obama administration guidelines.
[00:52:45.389 --> 00:52:49.215]  Of course it is, because now we're in a situation where we're just running by executive order.
[00:52:49.235 --> 00:52:54.624]  Except that the Trump people and Attorney General Sessions is doing the right thing on this.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:03.644]  They say a school's failure to treat students consistent with their gender identity may create or contribute to a hostile environment in violation of Title IX.
[00:53:03.724 --> 00:53:05.765]  That was what the Obama administration said.
[00:53:05.785 --> 00:53:07.886]  Now Title IX is a law that goes back to 1972.
[00:53:08.226 --> 00:53:15.410]  So for 45 years, 45 years, we didn't have a hostile environment in our bathrooms until Barack Obama noticed that.
[00:53:16.363 --> 00:53:22.184]  Then we had a hostile environment, and they said, we're going to withdraw some of the money that we have addicted you to.
[00:53:22.304 --> 00:53:23.885]  See, that's another kind of addiction, isn't it?
[00:53:24.605 --> 00:53:30.246]  That the states have become addicted to this money from the federal government that's printed by the Federal Reserve, and they don't have to have anything backing it up.
[00:53:30.886 --> 00:53:37.327]  And now we've had the response from the Executive Director of the National Center for Transgender Equality saying, this is about kids who want to go to school, who just want to be themselves.
[00:53:37.347 --> 00:53:37.847]  Well, you know what?
[00:53:37.927 --> 00:53:40.988]  It's also about children who don't want to be subjected to
[00:53:42.082 --> 00:53:50.928]  Voyeurs or exhibitionists, it's about people who don't want to put themselves in a situation where they're at a greater risk of being molested sexually.
[00:53:51.248 --> 00:53:52.629]  That's why we have the restrooms like that.
[00:53:52.649 --> 00:53:53.950]  That's why it's always been done that way.
[00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:56.652]  But it is not a federal issue.
[00:53:57.172 --> 00:54:01.995]  And this was done one day, one day after Jeff Sessions became Attorney General.
[00:54:02.075 --> 00:54:03.096]  He put this information out.
[00:54:03.596 --> 00:54:08.019]  One day after he was sworn in, the Justice Department sought permission to delay a hearing on a motion.
[00:54:08.039 --> 00:54:13.262]  Now this was going to be, the federal government was trying to fight this, and he says, no, we don't want to fight this.
[00:54:13.443 --> 00:54:19.767]  Nevertheless, as they went through the process, the New York Times reports that a fight has erupted within the Trump administration.
[00:54:20.507 --> 00:54:22.169]  Over transgender student rights.
[00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:28.994]  So they say, even though Attorney General Sessions was against it, Betsy DeVos wanted to retain the rule.
[00:54:29.755 --> 00:54:29.975]  Ms.
[00:54:29.995 --> 00:54:40.444]  DeVos initially resisted signing off on overturning this and told President Trump she was uncomfortable overturning it, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of the internal discussions.
[00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:46.612]  Mr. Sessions reports the New York Times, who strongly opposes expanding these rights, as they put it.
[00:54:46.953 --> 00:54:49.497]  They say these are gay, lesbian, and transgender rights.
[00:54:49.517 --> 00:54:50.738]  This is the New York Times talking.
[00:54:50.758 --> 00:54:51.520]  I understand that.
[00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:53.709]  Mr. Sessions fought Ms.
[00:54:53.729 --> 00:54:58.310]  DeVos on the issue and pressed her to relent because he could not go forward without her consent.
[00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:59.971]  He's trying to follow the law.
[00:55:01.011 --> 00:55:03.951]  The order must come from the Justice and the Education Departments.
[00:55:04.431 --> 00:55:07.832]  Eventually, Mr. Trump sided with his attorney general, these Republicans said, telling Ms.
[00:55:07.852 --> 00:55:13.673]  DeVos in a meeting in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he wanted her to drop her objections and Ms.
[00:55:13.693 --> 00:55:18.834]  DeVos, faced with a choice of resigning or defying the President, has agreed to go along.
[00:55:18.894 --> 00:55:21.195]  The Justice Department declined to comment on Wednesday.
[00:55:22.213 --> 00:55:25.954]  And I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so about Betsy DeVos.
[00:55:25.994 --> 00:55:28.275]  This is a woman who is a part of the educational establishment.
[00:55:28.495 --> 00:55:30.516]  She is a part of the GOP establishment.
[00:55:31.176 --> 00:55:36.939]  She hung out with Jeb Bush and the organizations that she funded and ran, pushed Common Core.
[00:55:36.999 --> 00:55:37.959]  We saw this happening.
[00:55:37.999 --> 00:55:38.819]  She is a statist.
[00:55:39.039 --> 00:55:40.320]  She is part of the establishment.
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:51.104]  And we cannot expect this woman, who thinks that the Education Department, which should not even exist, that this Department of Education should tell us how and where we can go to the bathroom.
[00:55:51.923 --> 00:55:53.745]  There shouldn't even be a Department of Education.
[00:55:53.765 --> 00:55:56.989]  There's no authority in the Constitution for a Department of Education.
[00:55:57.009 --> 00:55:59.151]  Of course, she's not going to shut that down.
[00:55:59.171 --> 00:56:03.096]  She wants to hang on to every last shred of power that she has.
[00:56:03.476 --> 00:56:06.339]  But on the positive side, I want to take a look at what's going on in the EPA.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.181]  Now, we think that this is positive.
[00:56:08.201 --> 00:56:10.722]  Of course, the liberals are having a fit about this.
[00:56:12.282 --> 00:56:17.945]  Forbes says online that Scott Pruitt laid out a vision for the EPA that contradicts its very mission.
[00:56:18.485 --> 00:56:19.185]  No, he didn't.
[00:56:19.925 --> 00:56:20.446]  No, he didn't.
[00:56:21.086 --> 00:56:26.648]  The EPA contradicts the Constitution and tries to destroy entire industries.
[00:56:26.708 --> 00:56:27.949]  That is not its job.
[00:56:28.729 --> 00:56:41.655]  Okay, new Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt addressed the EPA staff and the media yesterday, and in a speech lasting less than 15 minutes, says Forbes, he spoke mostly about protecting jobs, industry, and the marketplace.
[00:56:41.875 --> 00:56:44.797]  Oh yeah, they said, and the environment too, sarcastically.
[00:56:45.337 --> 00:56:47.198]  He spent a fair amount of time, says Forbes,
[00:56:48.178 --> 00:56:50.260]  Suing the very federal agency that he now heads.
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:50.820]  Why?
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:52.402]  Because they exceeded their authority.
[00:56:53.062 --> 00:56:58.006]  Because we have bureaucracies that the Congress has abdicated its authority to.
[00:56:58.046 --> 00:57:00.568]  These bureaucracies create law.
[00:57:01.169 --> 00:57:02.129]  They are not elected.
[00:57:02.330 --> 00:57:05.052]  We have legislation without representation.
[00:57:05.592 --> 00:57:06.553]  They create fines.
[00:57:06.593 --> 00:57:08.415]  We have taxation without representation.
[00:57:08.455 --> 00:57:11.557]  They don't care if the fines are excessive because they say these are rules.
[00:57:11.577 --> 00:57:12.138]  They're civil.
[00:57:12.558 --> 00:57:14.620]  So you don't get Sixth Amendment protection.
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:22.671]  And of course they act as their own police force, their own trial agencies where you don't have the presumption of innocence.
[00:57:23.312 --> 00:57:28.018]  Now they point out that in the speech he didn't talk about the word climate.
[00:57:28.279 --> 00:57:29.681]  Never mentioned it in 15 minutes.
[00:57:29.801 --> 00:57:30.041]  Why?
[00:57:30.822 --> 00:57:32.062]  Well, I think that's very good news.
[00:57:32.523 --> 00:57:33.583]  I think that is very good news.
[00:57:33.603 --> 00:57:36.164]  Look, you have to understand these climate models have failed.
[00:57:36.744 --> 00:57:39.344]  In the few areas that we can test them, they have failed.
[00:57:40.205 --> 00:57:44.046]  And in most of these areas, they can't be validated because they've got such a long timetable.
[00:57:44.806 --> 00:57:46.046]  The measurements have been rigged.
[00:57:46.707 --> 00:57:56.149]  They don't understand what tolerances are when they say that we can, the planet is going to burst into flames if we have a one degree increase, all the icebergs are going to melt and so forth.
[00:57:56.509 --> 00:57:57.930]  They don't have that kind of accuracy.
[00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:02.012]  And of course they're playing games in terms of rigging the temperatures.
[00:58:02.272 --> 00:58:09.477]  So it's a great thing that we have a head of the EPA who is now going to reverse this.
[00:58:09.657 --> 00:58:11.418]  Again, you want to live by executive order?
[00:58:11.438 --> 00:58:13.999]  You want to live by bureaucracy that just sets the rules?
[00:58:14.039 --> 00:58:15.420]  Well now those rules are going to be reset.
[00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.782]  But of course, they're going to come after him very hard.
[00:58:17.802 --> 00:58:22.825]  They're already coming after him saying that he has ties to the industry, that he's supposed to regulate.
[00:58:23.425 --> 00:58:25.127]  What about the Obama administration?
[00:58:25.147 --> 00:58:30.813]  Did you ever hear anything about them and their ties to the solar industry or their subsidy of Elon Musk?
[00:58:30.833 --> 00:58:32.995]  They picked the winners and the losers.
[00:58:33.355 --> 00:58:34.997]  They overstepped their authority.
[00:58:35.177 --> 00:58:36.558]  He sued them to stop that.
[00:58:37.426 --> 00:58:45.674]  It is the duty of a regulator to ask people what the effects are and what the alternatives are, and that's what we find in these emails that they're so excited about.
[00:58:46.075 --> 00:58:47.096]  Stay with us when we come back.
[00:58:47.196 --> 00:58:49.098]  Alex Jones is going to be taking your calls.
[00:58:49.398 --> 00:58:57.547]  He's going to have a, actually, he's not going to be taking calls, it's going to be an AMA, and he's going to be responding to you asking him anything.
[00:58:57.587 --> 00:58:58.347]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:58.367 --> 00:58:58.748]  Stay with us.
[00:59:07.642 --> 00:59:13.446]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:13.907 --> 00:59:23.614]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:23.934 --> 00:59:27.695]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:28.235 --> 00:59:32.917]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:33.297 --> 00:59:39.519]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:39.839 --> 00:59:42.119]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
