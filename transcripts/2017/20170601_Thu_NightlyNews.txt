[00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:21.159]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.765]  Today is Thursday, June 1st, 2017.
[00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:28.651]  I'm Millie Weaver and here's what's coming up tonight on the news.
[00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:36.667]  Look who's coming to the InfoWar!
[00:00:36.968 --> 00:00:45.915]  Next week, Megyn Kelly will be in our studios for what is sure to be a historic interview with Alex Jones.
[00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:49.538]  Meanwhile, the Liberals' favorite propagandist,
[00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.061]  I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh.
[00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:14.035]  Not Paris.
[00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:18.020]  All that plus the InfoWars crew live from Bilderberg 2017.
[00:01:18.902 --> 00:01:22.887]  That's up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.247 --> 00:01:38.134]  During this Memorial Day, I want to thank the veterans that have fought, but of course, most importantly, those that have died, because that's what this holiday and remembrance is all about.
[00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:45.500]  Take advantage of these unprecedented specials and help support the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists while supplies last.
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.023]  These are the biggest sales ever on these items.
[00:01:49.383 --> 00:01:52.726]  You add auto ship, several of these are lost leaders.
[00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:57.971]  So for myself and the entire InfoWars crew, I salute you and thank you for all your prayers on this Memorial Day.
[00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:02.132]  Just understand that without you there'd be nothing, because you are the InfoWars.
[00:02:02.412 --> 00:02:06.533]  This is the InfoWars PowerPak, and it can start your car if it has a dead battery.
[00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:11.033]  And now we're going to use the PowerPak to jumpstart this truck.
[00:02:11.434 --> 00:02:12.414]  And we're going to show you.
[00:02:12.874 --> 00:02:14.134]  Switch on the PowerPak.
[00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:17.855]  Wait a few minutes, and then you'll be able to start your car.
[00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:23.516]  With just a few minutes on the InfoWars BatteryPak, you go from a dead battery to this.
[00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:32.899]  You get all that cranking power in this little brick!
[00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:39.143]  The Info Wars Power Pack is a must-have and it'll give you peace of mind whether you're at home or on the go.
[00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:45.147]  It's so compact it'll fit in your backpack, your glove box, or even your back pocket.
[00:02:45.547 --> 00:02:50.351]  Get one for your home, boat, car, camping setup, or just for emergencies.
[00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:56.835]  Secure your peace of mind today and order your Info Wars Power Pack from InfoWarsStore.com or dial 1-888-253-3139
[00:03:00.077 --> 00:03:00.163]  Yeah.
[00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.530]  I'm Millie Weaver and I'm going to be taking you guys through the news tonight.
[00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:19.794]  Then, later on in this segment, we are going to be joined by David Knight from Chantilly, Virginia, where he is out there covering the Bilderberg Conference.
[00:03:20.214 --> 00:03:29.918]  Well, first, I wanted to announce and remind you all that Alex Jones will be interviewed by Megyn Kelly next week.
[00:03:30.738 --> 00:03:34.281]  Now, this should be very interesting and eventful.
[00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:46.370]  Megyn Kelly is actually going to be coming out deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, Texas, to the InfoWars studio, and she's going to be sitting down with Alex and interviewing him.
[00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:50.614]  Now, this is probably a hit piece, and Alex is pretty aware of that.
[00:03:50.654 --> 00:03:51.955]  He's said that over and over.
[00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:58.278]  However, I'm sure it'll be super interesting, just like we've seen with Piers Morgan.
[00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:06.182]  I mean, I was literally jumping up and down in my seat, screaming, laughing at the Piers Morgan interview.
[00:04:06.202 --> 00:04:15.286]  And another thing, James Comey is scheduled to testify June 8th before a Senate Intelligence Committee.
[00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:30.198]  Now, this should be very interesting because Comey's testimony is supposedly set to answer questions about what all was surrounding his mysterious firing and the timeliness of it.
[00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:39.906]  Now, I'm sure the mainstream media is going to come up with all kinds of things saying, the Russians, the Russians, you know, that's going to start back up in the media pool.
[00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:53.837]  But I just think it's interesting that the other night Hillary Clinton actually sat down in this interview and she tried to claim that, you know, the Russians are the reason she lost and Infowars was working with the Russians and that's why she lost.
[00:04:53.957 --> 00:04:54.837]  Okay, give me a break.
[00:04:56.158 --> 00:04:59.481]  That's ridiculous, and we all know how ridiculous that sounds.
[00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:01.482]  I mean, give me a break Hillary Clinton.
[00:05:01.942 --> 00:05:10.608]  Are you going to continue complaining about being a sore loser and complaining about losing, you know, ten years from now when you're in a nursing home?
[00:05:10.828 --> 00:05:13.890]  I mean, my gosh, I mean, she might be in a nursing home sooner than that.
[00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:21.376]  Well, another interesting story, and this was pretty amazing, Trump pulled out of the climate
[00:05:22.537 --> 00:05:30.192]  I mean, the climate accord that Paris had set up, I mean, it was an agreement where
[00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:34.866]  The Americans were just not getting a good deal.
[00:05:35.587 --> 00:05:44.493]  And Trump made it clear that he is going to put America first and that this Paris Agreement was not to the betterment of Americans.
[00:05:44.853 --> 00:05:50.677]  It was going to actually cost Americans 6.6 million jobs.
[00:05:50.797 --> 00:05:52.598]  And that's an underestimate.
[00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:55.620]  That's a lot of jobs.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.521]  86% of the coal industry would have been tapered.
[00:05:57.601 --> 00:05:59.342]  I mean, it goes on and on and on.
[00:05:59.382 --> 00:06:01.544]  All these industries, the steel industry.
[00:06:02.385 --> 00:06:12.777]  That we all were going to have to take these cuts and these hits in the name of climate change, which the climate science out there is pretty ridiculous.
[00:06:12.857 --> 00:06:20.546]  I mean, they have very, they have over exaggerated these climate change data sets that they have.
[00:06:22.148 --> 00:06:35.335]  As much as this is super exciting, I wanted to roll a clip from Trump's speech because he really kind of goes into the reasons why he did this, why he decided to be brave and say, no, we're going to put Americans first.
[00:06:35.696 --> 00:06:41.759]  I mean, Obama, he's the one who actually agreed to this Paris agreement.
[00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:45.641]  And he didn't actually put it in front of Congress.
[00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:52.184]  He didn't follow the natural path that you're supposed to follow in these types of treaties and agreements.
[00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:54.385]  So it's not actually a proper treaty.
[00:06:54.825 --> 00:07:01.588]  So it's a good thing that Trump set the precedence and said, no, you know, we're not, we're going to back out of this.
[00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:03.009]  It wasn't done the right way.
[00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:04.470]  It's unconstitutional to begin with.
[00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.431]  So let's go ahead and roll to this clip.
[00:07:08.131 --> 00:07:11.233]  I am fighting every day for the great people.
[00:07:12.392 --> 00:07:12.672]  I think?
[00:07:39.775 --> 00:07:42.556]  Yeah, Obama never submitted it to Congress for passage.
[00:07:42.576 --> 00:07:46.258]  Thank you.
[00:07:49.539 --> 00:08:08.568]  But begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris Accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
[00:08:10.424 --> 00:08:11.304]  So we're getting out.
[00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:14.666]  But we will start to negotiate.
[00:08:16.087 --> 00:08:18.167]  And we will see if we can make a deal that's fair.
[00:08:18.428 --> 00:08:19.988]  And if we can, that's great.
[00:08:21.489 --> 00:08:25.451]  So we'll have to wait around and see what this new agreement might look like.
[00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:30.093]  But it's good news so far that Trump has pulled the United States out of this agreement.
[00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:30.853]  It was horrible.
[00:08:31.213 --> 00:08:37.416]  The amount of energy savings or carbon credits or whatever that we would have done in 30 years would have been
[00:08:39.677 --> 00:08:40.578]  We're good to go.
[00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.211]  I mean, this is very interesting.
[00:09:03.231 --> 00:09:10.754]  This is when these globalists are all coming together to sit there and conspire to talk about how they're going to take out the Trump administration.
[00:09:11.194 --> 00:09:18.237]  I'm sure they are very upset with Trump's latest by pulling out of this Paris climate change agreement.
[00:09:18.277 --> 00:09:19.558]  So let's go ahead and talk to David.
[00:09:19.598 --> 00:09:20.318]  How's it going, David?
[00:09:21.653 --> 00:09:22.233]  We're good, Milly.
[00:09:22.253 --> 00:09:22.513]  Thank you.
[00:09:22.533 --> 00:09:24.514]  This is David Knight here in Chantilly, Virginia.
[00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:25.274]  We're at Bilderberg 2017.
[00:09:25.475 --> 00:09:30.196]  And let me give you a headline from March of last year.
[00:09:30.256 --> 00:09:32.597]  This is when Donald Trump was campaigning for president.
[00:09:33.098 --> 00:09:34.658]  And here's the headline that applies today.
[00:09:34.778 --> 00:09:39.200]  Tech titans and GOP elite plot Trump attack.
[00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:41.738]  At that time, it was on a private island.
[00:09:42.218 --> 00:09:51.841]  It was Bill Kristol, the never-Trumper, the neocon, who was organizing the GOP elite and titans of technology to oppose candidate Trump.
[00:09:52.181 --> 00:09:55.021]  The same thing is happening now, except we're not on a private island.
[00:09:55.482 --> 00:10:01.663]  We're right here in the middle of the suburbs of Virginia, and most people don't even understand what's going on here.
[00:10:01.703 --> 00:10:03.904]  They don't know anything about Bilderberg, the people driving by here.
[00:10:03.924 --> 00:10:06.825]  For the most part, we talked to one individual who said, hey, what's going on?
[00:10:07.358 --> 00:10:09.641]  He saw some people here and he saw us with cameras.
[00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:10.503]  He wanted to know what was going on.
[00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:13.847]  He didn't know anything about Bilderberg, but that's the bottom line.
[00:10:14.248 --> 00:10:20.457]  It's the tech elite, and when we look at this climate change, understand that there's three different approaches to this.
[00:10:21.407 --> 00:10:24.888]  And it appears that Donald Trump has taken kind of a middle ground.
[00:10:25.108 --> 00:10:28.929]  I wish he had taken a stronger approach to this, but it's good that he's shutting this down.
[00:10:29.249 --> 00:10:34.670]  As you pointed out, Millie, this is something that was a deal that at the very least was very unfair to the United States.
[00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:44.912]  And apart from the science of it, as we argue over the science, whether or not the models are any good, whether or not the climate change exists, or whether it's man-made, we can argue about that.
[00:10:44.952 --> 00:10:49.513]  But while we're arguing about that, understand that it is these tech elites
[00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:55.228]  These globalists who are essentially setting up a system to rob us all.
[00:10:55.488 --> 00:11:01.129]  Regardless of where you are on the science of this, they're going to rob everyone to empower themselves.
[00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:03.630]  And so he was right to shut it down on that basis.
[00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.071]  Now, there are different groups within the Trump administration.
[00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:10.711]  We had Bannon and we had Scott Pruitt, who is head of the EPA.
[00:11:10.911 --> 00:11:11.892]  They said, get out of it.
[00:11:12.092 --> 00:11:14.032]  We don't need to be in this climate change.
[00:11:14.722 --> 00:11:15.383]  I don't know.
[00:11:30.109 --> 00:11:48.421]  China, who is the number one polluter, is going to be able to continue to increase the metrics that they're looking at for until 2030, whereas we're going to have to start capping and cutting 10 years before that, drastic cuts throughout the West, while the number one polluter continues to go on.
[00:11:48.481 --> 00:11:50.663]  That's the redistribution that's going on at one level.
[00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:54.165]  We have to understand that the real issue here, and this is why
[00:11:54.955 --> 00:12:02.221]  Bannon and Scott Pruitt are correct, because we have to stop the mechanism that will fund a global government.
[00:12:02.961 --> 00:12:15.311]  This is a supranational organization, an agreement that is multilateral, and Trump has said many times he didn't like TPP, he didn't like TTIP, because they were multilateral agreements.
[00:12:15.391 --> 00:12:17.332]  We need to have bilateral trade.
[00:12:17.693 --> 00:12:18.934]  We want bilateral trade.
[00:12:19.214 --> 00:12:22.036]  But we want to do these agreements one-on-one with other countries.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:30.318]  We need to always be suspicious of supranational agreements that are multinational, because what is really behind those?
[00:12:30.891 --> 00:12:35.114]  That is world government, and that's what's really behind this Paris Climate Treaty.
[00:12:35.135 --> 00:12:35.955]  It's world government.
[00:12:35.975 --> 00:12:37.556]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:12:37.837 --> 00:12:39.998]  That's simply a way of marketing it.
[00:12:40.279 --> 00:12:41.860]  It is simply a beard for this.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.043]  They have to have a global tax to fund a global government.
[00:12:46.464 --> 00:12:53.950]  That's right, you know, and Obama, he never actually even presented it to Congress for debate or passage.
[00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.373]  He just kind of decided to do this almost like a dictator.
[00:12:57.393 --> 00:12:59.835]  He just decided, well, I think this is...
[00:13:01.303 --> 00:13:01.783]  Exactly.
[00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:05.445]  He just made it up in his own mind that that's what was going to happen.
[00:13:05.685 --> 00:13:14.450]  And so do you think that people at Bilderberg right now are talking about how they can try and reinvigorate the Paris Accord?
[00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.851]  Oh, you bet they are.
[00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:16.371]  You bet they are.
[00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:17.832]  They were very unhappy with what happened.
[00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:20.673]  It was a good sign when Donald Trump went to G7.
[00:13:21.154 --> 00:13:23.455]  And again, as we're talking about Bilderberg, why is it
[00:13:23.965 --> 00:13:26.147]  That everybody covered the G7 meeting.
[00:13:26.207 --> 00:13:27.168]  You had all the press there.
[00:13:27.208 --> 00:13:30.551]  They were talking to, they were asking questions of the attendees there.
[00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:35.575]  And yet here you have a situation where nobody is allowed to even see who's going in there.
[00:13:35.635 --> 00:13:37.356]  They're coming in and they're darkened limousines.
[00:13:37.797 --> 00:13:40.019]  And that's where the real power is.
[00:13:40.439 --> 00:13:42.321]  Because they don't want you to know what's going on here.
[00:13:42.361 --> 00:13:44.442]  They will make a big dog and pony show at the G7.
[00:13:44.462 --> 00:13:46.904]  They'll make a big dog and pony show at Davos.
[00:13:46.985 --> 00:13:48.446]  And at G7, as you pointed out, Millie,
[00:13:48.986 --> 00:13:50.507]  It was six against one.
[00:13:50.687 --> 00:13:52.747]  Angela Merkel was very upset with Donald Trump.
[00:13:52.847 --> 00:13:55.828]  I saw that as a very good sign that she wasn't getting what she wanted out of him.
[00:13:56.429 --> 00:14:00.290]  And again, that was verified today that they weren't going to get what they wanted out of him.
[00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.630]  NATO is also here.
[00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.452]  They're going to be talking about how to move forward with Donald Trump.
[00:14:05.472 --> 00:14:06.392]  So that's very important.
[00:14:06.692 --> 00:14:11.334]  But there's another aspect that we may need to go to a break, and we can talk about it when we come back if we've got more time.
[00:14:11.394 --> 00:14:12.194]  But go ahead.
[00:14:13.017 --> 00:14:20.144]  Well, I just wanted to ask what you thought about the fact that Trump Administration National Security Advisor General H.R.
[00:14:20.184 --> 00:14:22.066]  McMaster is said to be attending this.
[00:14:22.086 --> 00:14:22.927]  What do you think about that?
[00:14:23.988 --> 00:14:24.969]  Well, I think that's very troubling.
[00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:30.574]  You know, we have people, we've had David Rockefeller who's died, and we had Zbigniew Brzezinski who's died.
[00:14:31.727 --> 00:14:33.308]  They were the architects of this stuff.
[00:14:33.929 --> 00:14:35.310]  Actually, they were like the second generation.
[00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:52.545]  But again, Zbigniew Brzezinski was the architect of the Trilateral Commission and the three power block approach that was reflected in the Transatlantic and the Trans-Pacific partnerships that were all going to consolidate those regions and then consolidate them together with the United States as the backbone of those two wings.
[00:14:52.985 --> 00:14:55.507]  So Zbigniew Brzezinski died, but we have a new generation.
[00:14:55.807 --> 00:14:56.788]  We have people like H.R.
[00:14:56.828 --> 00:14:57.469]  McMaster.
[00:14:57.889 --> 00:14:58.510]  He is a
[00:15:00.451 --> 00:15:01.572]  He worked with Petraeus.
[00:15:01.632 --> 00:15:02.612]  He worked for Petraeus.
[00:15:02.872 --> 00:15:05.673]  David Petraeus is now a regular attendee here at Bilderberg.
[00:15:06.314 --> 00:15:08.975]  McMaster is part of the Council on Foreign Relations, CFR.
[00:15:09.495 --> 00:15:10.415]  So are the other people here.
[00:15:10.455 --> 00:15:14.617]  Nadia Shadwell, she's also CFR, so she's here as one of his assistants.
[00:15:14.937 --> 00:15:17.678]  So we have several people from the Trump administration.
[00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:18.719]  Wilbur Ross.
[00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:21.401]  And those other individuals that are here.
[00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:23.202]  That's very troubling to see that.
[00:15:23.402 --> 00:15:27.786]  But again, you know, the actions that we see from Donald Trump are moving in the other direction.
[00:15:27.806 --> 00:15:30.788]  So we're getting some mixed signals from Donald Trump.
[00:15:30.828 --> 00:15:33.270]  But it's a good thing that he's pushing back against the globalists.
[00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.572]  They are very unhappy with what he's doing.
[00:15:35.952 --> 00:15:37.533]  That's a very positive sign.
[00:15:37.653 --> 00:15:39.135]  So is that behind you?
[00:15:39.975 --> 00:15:42.237]  Are those gates to the Bilderberg?
[00:15:42.457 --> 00:15:43.338]  Are the cars that go?
[00:15:44.184 --> 00:15:45.165]  This is all you can see of it.
[00:15:45.245 --> 00:15:45.886]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:15:45.906 --> 00:15:47.007]  They picked a venue here.
[00:15:47.027 --> 00:15:52.053]  If you look at this and kind of pan around a little bit, Harrison, this is all trees, so you can't see anything at all.
[00:15:52.093 --> 00:15:53.235]  They've blocked everything off.
[00:15:53.295 --> 00:15:55.898]  They've got police here, but it is very, very low key, Millie.
[00:15:56.659 --> 00:15:59.042]  And earlier in the day, we did a report.
[00:15:59.082 --> 00:16:01.925]  I put something up and so did Owen.
[00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:03.372]  We're good to go.
[00:16:15.464 --> 00:16:18.205]  Being, uh, keeping their distance, being very low-key.
[00:16:18.565 --> 00:16:20.806]  As we walked around over there, there was, like, only one cop.
[00:16:21.126 --> 00:16:27.588]  And we were shooting the side of the building as a backdrop, showing how the windows had been blacked out, and there were one or two cops.
[00:16:27.608 --> 00:16:32.050]  All of a sudden, went from one to two to four to eight to sixteen, and they started circling us.
[00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:40.893]  It was like the scene from, uh, Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, where the birds start accumulating on the, on the wires behind you, and all of a sudden, there's a, there's a big flock of them.
[00:16:41.013 --> 00:16:43.554]  But they stayed, stayed at a distance from us, but that's,
[00:16:44.034 --> 00:16:45.315]  Why, it's very important for them.
[00:16:45.355 --> 00:16:48.096]  We have very powerful people who are here.
[00:16:48.316 --> 00:17:02.343]  You know, David, it's pretty interesting that they have this big border wall surrounding their event, but these globalists are working hard during this event to figure out how to stop America from having a secure border.
[00:17:02.484 --> 00:17:03.844]  That's right, that's right.
[00:17:04.224 --> 00:17:07.266]  They've got their walls and they are fiercely protected.
[00:17:07.952 --> 00:17:09.693]  And I think here's another thing, too, Millie.
[00:17:10.534 --> 00:17:18.961]  Just real quickly, when you talked about whether or not we can get out of this agreement, immediately Bloomberg said, wait a minute, there are legal issues here.
[00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:21.163]  He can't get out until 2020 at the earliest.
[00:17:21.203 --> 00:17:25.746]  But understand that Barack Obama said he wasn't going to go to Congress to ratify this.
[00:17:25.987 --> 00:17:27.708]  He said, I'm going to self-ratify this treaty.
[00:17:28.068 --> 00:17:33.292]  If you look at the Paris Climate Agreement, it says that it is legally binding.
[00:17:34.293 --> 00:17:36.194]  Subject to ratification.
[00:17:36.575 --> 00:17:44.539]  You cannot change the meaning of ratification and have one meaning for a Democrat, another meaning for a Republican administration.
[00:17:44.719 --> 00:17:46.180]  Ratification means ratification.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.441]  It never was ratified.
[00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:51.223]  It was simply done by the executive order, so it should be able to take it out by that.
[00:17:51.524 --> 00:17:55.046]  Now, talking about the people who are here, we have an individual, Christopher Liddell.
[00:17:55.426 --> 00:17:56.206]  He's from New Zealand.
[00:17:56.467 --> 00:18:00.389]  He was the chief financial officer, the CFO for a lot of big corporations here in America.
[00:18:00.729 --> 00:18:02.790]  General Motors, Microsoft and others.
[00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.532]  Trump brought him in to his administration.
[00:18:05.572 --> 00:18:11.835]  Now, one of the early meetings... Well, David, you know, we are running out of time right now.
[00:18:12.236 --> 00:18:14.417]  But, you know, I just wanted to touch on one more thing.
[00:18:14.457 --> 00:18:24.123]  The fact that some of the key topics of discussion during Bilderberg this year, one of them was the war on information, which sounds a lot like info wars.
[00:18:24.623 --> 00:18:28.205]  I mean, it seems like they're going to be talking about how they can take us out.
[00:18:28.225 --> 00:18:29.806]  Do you want to say something really quick on that?
[00:18:31.563 --> 00:18:34.725]  One of the key attendees who's been here every year has been Alex Karp.
[00:18:34.965 --> 00:18:35.805]  He's with Palantir.
[00:18:35.905 --> 00:18:37.466]  They do the data mining for the CIA.
[00:18:37.786 --> 00:18:38.887]  That's all you need to know.
[00:18:39.347 --> 00:18:39.667]  All right.
[00:18:39.707 --> 00:18:41.748]  Well, thank you so much for joining us, David.
[00:18:42.228 --> 00:18:47.390]  And you guys, just please remember to support us because we are under attack by the globalists.
[00:18:47.691 --> 00:18:49.051]  They're doing everything in their power.
[00:18:49.091 --> 00:18:53.293]  They're meeting right now at Bilderberg, plotting how they're going to take us out.
[00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.374]  So stay tuned after this short break.
[00:18:55.394 --> 00:18:59.136]  There's going to be more awesome reports on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:07.746]  Thanks to your support, InfoWars has been able to expand its operations against the globalists at this critical time.
[00:19:08.026 --> 00:19:15.732]  And it's absolutely essential that we expand in the face of the enemy, because as history shows, political movements only expand or contract.
[00:19:16.113 --> 00:19:19.655]  And that's why the globalists are hitting us with everything they've got.
[00:19:19.976 --> 00:19:23.579]  Censorship, demonization, attacks, misrepresentations.
[00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:25.640]  They're not just trying to shut down InfoWars.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.101]  They're trying to fire Sean Hannity.
[00:19:27.522 --> 00:19:28.943]  They're trying to cold talk radio.
[00:19:28.983 --> 00:19:34.227]  They're trying to silence true, independent, nationalistic media.
[00:19:34.608 --> 00:19:38.090]  And InfoWars is at the very heart of that resistance.
[00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:49.680]  We all see the dumbed-down trendies that appear to be soulless and how they're obsessed with consumerism and criticizing capitalism as they walk around in their expensive Nike tennis shoes and have their slave-made iPhones.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.283]  So, I personally am disgusted by empty consumerism.
[00:19:54.073 --> 00:20:09.303]  But the globalists want to get rid of free markets because there is such a thing as positive consumerism historically, where people can use the power they have of the purse to actually support building free and independent economies.
[00:20:09.824 --> 00:20:13.006]  So you're not just getting amazing products when you go to InfoWarshaw.com.
[00:20:13.246 --> 00:20:20.151]  You're also supporting a broadcast that is the very front lines of the resistance against the globalists.

[00:20:56.637 --> 00:20:57.677]  We've got Brain Force, 47% off.

[00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:27.447]  In closing, we've already come this far together and we've seen the devastating effects truth has against the global crime syndicate.
[00:21:27.467 --> 00:21:29.008]  But the enemy's striking back.
[00:21:29.688 --> 00:21:34.650]  So again, from myself, the entire InfoWars crew, I want to salute and thank all of you.
[00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:39.952]  No matter what color you are or where you came from, if the love of liberty and justice beats in your heart,
[00:21:40.652 --> 00:21:44.754]  Give the love of standing up against tyrants flows through your veins.
[00:21:44.794 --> 00:21:50.196]  We are all brothers and sisters together in this epic experiment that is life.
[00:21:50.837 --> 00:21:52.697]  So again, thank you all for your support.
[00:21:53.037 --> 00:22:00.601]  Visit InfoWarsTour.com today to get some of the best deals ever offered on incredible nutraceuticals, supplements, and so much more.
[00:22:01.943 --> 00:22:03.604]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:22:03.764 --> 00:22:10.228]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:22:10.368 --> 00:22:22.957]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[00:22:23.317 --> 00:22:23.917]  Caveman.
[00:22:24.157 --> 00:22:29.161]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[00:22:29.221 --> 00:22:31.342]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:34.743]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:22:34.783 --> 00:22:39.565]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[00:22:39.925 --> 00:22:47.668]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[00:22:48.068 --> 00:22:55.931]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[00:22:56.011 --> 00:23:00.653]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself at InfoWarsLive.com today.
[00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:15.636]  My past, my calling, my name is Maxine.
[00:23:16.657 --> 00:23:21.221]  I grew up a black woman in a racist, sexist city.
[00:23:21.662 --> 00:23:26.746]  But despite the odds being against me, I made it.
[00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:30.469]  I have a right to my anger.
[00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.492]  I call it rebellion.
[00:23:49.008 --> 00:24:06.555]  The disproportionate numbers of black males that are in prisons around this country are in prisons because they don't have the wealth by which to get fancy lawyers who will go in and ensure that they buy justice for them as white folks can do in America.
[00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:07.936]  This is punishment.
[00:24:08.336 --> 00:24:14.739]  This is being very harsh on the most vulnerable people in our society, to include liquor stores,
[00:24:21.105 --> 00:24:27.451]  Waters has been charged with ethics violations for asking regulators to help a bank in which her husband had a financial interest.
[00:24:27.792 --> 00:24:29.734]  She denies breaking any house rules.
[00:24:29.774 --> 00:24:35.820]  What people have seen on television in recent days is outlandish behavior.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.682]  By the Tea Party operation in Washington, D.C.
[00:24:41.062 --> 00:24:45.904]  And I think that speaks volumes about what's causing problems in Washington, D.C.
[00:24:45.924 --> 00:24:47.905]  What exactly outlandish behavior?
[00:24:47.945 --> 00:24:49.626]  Specifically, what do you mean?
[00:24:49.686 --> 00:24:51.487]  The shouting.
[00:24:51.587 --> 00:24:54.108]  The Republicans were out there having a great time.
[00:24:54.128 --> 00:24:54.929]  They were laughing.
[00:24:55.169 --> 00:24:56.870]  They were waving the American flag.
[00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:57.730]  They were egging them on.
[00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.791]  And I thought that was outrageous behavior.
[00:25:00.451 --> 00:25:02.653]  Guess what this liberal will be all about?
[00:25:03.013 --> 00:25:14.860]  This liberal will be all about socializing, basically taking over and the government running all of your companies.
[00:25:33.797 --> 00:25:34.798]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:25:35.659 --> 00:25:40.843]  After all I'd done to pave the way for a woman president.
[00:25:41.323 --> 00:25:47.047]  That I still lived in a sexist nation that couldn't handle a woman president.
[00:25:47.408 --> 00:25:49.589]  But then, it occurred to me.
[00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:52.111]  We didn't lose the election.
[00:25:53.092 --> 00:25:55.954]  The Russians stole it.
[00:25:56.875 --> 00:25:59.978]  And I'm telling everybody.
[00:26:01.619 --> 00:26:09.322]  I believe that there was a connection between Donald Trump's campaign and the Russians and the Kremlin.
[00:26:09.742 --> 00:26:15.724]  Absolutely was in collusion with the Kremlin and Putin in Russia.
[00:26:16.165 --> 00:26:23.607]  Our intelligence agencies have already confirmed that the Russians did hack into the DNC.
[00:26:23.788 --> 00:26:25.808]  This is a bunch of scumbags.
[00:26:26.248 --> 00:26:27.249]  That's what they are.
[00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:28.309]  Those are very strong words, Congresswoman.
[00:26:28.329 --> 00:26:29.990]  Who are all organized around making money.
[00:26:31.158 --> 00:26:33.059]  Bing, bing, bong, bong, bing, bing, bing.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.123]  You have an investigation going on where the president is implicated.
[00:26:38.343 --> 00:26:41.226]  Just to be clear, there has been no actual evidence yet.
[00:26:41.506 --> 00:26:42.727]  No, it has not been.
[00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:43.507]  No, it has not.
[00:26:43.828 --> 00:26:45.509]  Can't people see what's going on?
[00:26:45.989 --> 00:26:49.612]  Why do you think they hacked into our election?
[00:26:49.952 --> 00:26:55.917]  They hacked into the election because they have to make sure that Donald Trump got elected.
[00:27:24.494 --> 00:27:24.974]  You know what?
[00:27:26.176 --> 00:27:33.822]  I built my career on appealing to the people that women of color can accomplish things too.
[00:27:34.583 --> 00:27:40.788]  But I'll be damned if a white man tries to virtue signal their way up the ladder.
[00:27:41.869 --> 00:27:47.114]  And as far as I'm concerned, the Tea Party can go straight to hell.
[00:27:49.206 --> 00:27:56.868]  You can't be intimidated.
[00:27:57.208 --> 00:27:58.389]  You can't be frightened.
[00:27:58.689 --> 00:28:01.929]  As far as I'm concerned, the Tea Party can go straight to hell.
[00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:14.333]  Hey Maxine Waters, why don't you quit worrying about the Tea Party and look at your own district and the hellhole that's been created there while you were the representative from that district, Maxine.
[00:28:19.324 --> 00:28:25.988]  Maxine Waters is not only a traitor to our nation, but she's not right in the head.
[00:28:26.569 --> 00:28:33.073]  In fact, the only people who are crazier than Maxine Waters are the people who support her.
[00:28:42.641 --> 00:28:48.362]  At this stage of my life, I get a little confused sometimes.
[00:28:48.823 --> 00:28:53.504]  And it sounds like I'm batshit crazy.
[00:28:54.104 --> 00:28:56.704]  But there's a method to my madness.
[00:28:56.865 --> 00:28:59.885]  Because this struggle, it ain't no joke.
[00:29:00.465 --> 00:29:02.946]  And my millennials, they stay wild.
[00:29:05.179 --> 00:29:05.960]  We've got to stop his ass!
[00:29:25.114 --> 00:29:31.302]  I think the millennials have adopted me because they really do believe I speak truth to power.
[00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:33.644]  And I discovered one thing, just tell the truth.
[00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:40.793]  I have not called for impeachment.
[00:29:44.889 --> 00:29:52.817]  The president is a liar, his actions are contemptible, and I'm going to fight every day until he's impeached.
[00:29:53.118 --> 00:29:55.540]  I have not called for the impeachment yet.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.603]  I say it over and over again, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.
[00:29:58.623 --> 00:30:03.368]  And I will fight every day until he is impeached!
[00:30:11.835 --> 00:30:16.661]  Should we wait to call for impeachment until we have the answers to that question?
[00:30:18.463 --> 00:30:20.426]  I have not called for impeachment.
[00:30:21.307 --> 00:30:23.569]  You said I'm going to fight every day until he's impeached.
[00:30:23.589 --> 00:30:24.370]  That's what you tweeted.
[00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:28.696]  You know people don't like to hear the word impeachment, but we know you like saying it.
[00:30:29.036 --> 00:30:30.377]  He lies every day.
[00:30:30.757 --> 00:30:33.659]  He's in bed with Putin and the Russians about oil.
[00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:40.203]  And everybody around him are allies with the Kremlin and with the oligarchs of Russia.
[00:30:40.483 --> 00:30:41.783]  They're going to take us down.
[00:30:43.064 --> 00:30:44.165]  This is extraordinary.
[00:30:44.245 --> 00:30:45.966]  This woman is delusional.
[00:30:46.286 --> 00:30:48.669]  I'm going to work every day until I get him impeached.
[00:31:01.223 --> 00:31:07.469]  I really do believe that much of what you saw coming out of Trump's mouth was a play from Putin's playbook.
[00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:13.235]  I think that when you saw him absolutely calling Hillary crooked.
[00:31:13.435 --> 00:31:14.416]  Crooked Hillary!
[00:31:14.656 --> 00:31:16.858]  Lock her up, lock her up, all of that was developed.
[00:31:17.199 --> 00:31:22.644]  I think that was developed strategically with people from the Kremlin, with Putin.
[00:31:22.824 --> 00:31:25.925]  You obviously have been very critical of James Comey in the past.
[00:31:26.265 --> 00:31:28.126]  You said that he had no credibility.
[00:31:28.206 --> 00:31:32.807]  I assume that you support the President's decision then to fire his FBI Director.
[00:31:33.428 --> 00:31:35.468]  No, I do not, necessarily.
[00:31:35.548 --> 00:31:37.769]  The FBI Director has no credibility.
[00:31:38.089 --> 00:31:44.631]  But if you said that FBI Director James Comey had no credibility, wouldn't you support the fact that the President then carried Trump?
[00:31:44.692 --> 00:31:44.992]  No, no, no, no.
[00:31:45.012 --> 00:31:47.012]  Now President Trump made the decision to get rid of him?
[00:31:47.252 --> 00:31:47.452]  No.
[00:31:47.733 --> 00:31:48.813]  No, not necessarily.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:57.122]  If Hillary Clinton had won the White House, would you have recommended that she fire FBI Director James Comey?
[00:31:57.883 --> 00:31:59.123]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:31:59.543 --> 00:32:08.247]  If she had won the White House, I believe that given what he did to her and what he tried to do, she should have fired him.
[00:32:08.407 --> 00:32:08.767]  Yes.
[00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:11.248]  The FBI Director has no credibility.
[00:32:11.608 --> 00:32:13.669]  We want a diplomatic solution.
[00:32:13.949 --> 00:32:17.851]  We do not want war in North Korea.
[00:32:22.478 --> 00:32:23.259]  Yeah, in Aleppo.
[00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:34.847]  And the fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea.
[00:32:36.288 --> 00:32:37.009]  North Korea.
[00:32:37.409 --> 00:32:40.191]  North Korea at all.
[00:32:40.351 --> 00:32:41.552]  Those goddamn North Koreans.
[00:32:41.612 --> 00:32:43.433]  They are some sneaky bastards.
[00:32:43.453 --> 00:32:43.914]  Stop it.
[00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:00.451]  My millennials!
[00:33:00.972 --> 00:33:01.632]  Stay woke!
[00:33:02.632 --> 00:33:03.972]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.052 --> 00:33:04.992]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.132 --> 00:33:06.573]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.893 --> 00:33:07.693]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.853 --> 00:33:08.613]  What has changed?
[00:33:09.013 --> 00:33:11.214]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.434 --> 00:33:13.134]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.174 --> 00:33:16.755]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately at your clinics.
[00:33:16.975 --> 00:33:23.836]  MycoZX supports normal fungal and yeast balanced proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients.
[00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:25.857]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:30.038]  We also have free shipping, orders for $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:33:30.118 --> 00:33:38.440]  Additionally, on top of that, I mean, you fund an organization dedicated to the truth and get something you and your family absolutely need, but you should consult your healthcare provider.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.221]  This is not a game.
[00:33:39.241 --> 00:33:43.482]  This is not a joke, especially if you have really big yeast levels or fungus in your body.
[00:33:43.502 --> 00:33:49.024]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.064 --> 00:33:49.524]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.904 --> 00:33:53.848]  So, we've been doing research, just like you have, on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.068 --> 00:34:01.455]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... No, we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:04.638]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:13.226]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:16.148]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:18.610]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.412]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.652 --> 00:34:27.895]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic, and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:30.596]  I've had nobody... Here's the thing, Alex.
[00:34:30.756 --> 00:34:37.218]  When you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:40.659]  It's going to show... You're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.401]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.421 --> 00:34:45.961]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:46.842]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.902 --> 00:34:48.122]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.162 --> 00:34:48.702]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.723 --> 00:34:49.823]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.163 --> 00:34:52.545]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.565 --> 00:34:55.187]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:56.208]  Yeast overgrowth?
[00:34:56.228 --> 00:35:00.911]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.971 --> 00:35:05.595]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:09.378]  By the way, folks, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.598 --> 00:35:11.199]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:12.720]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.001 --> 00:35:14.602]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.722 --> 00:35:15.723]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.964 --> 00:35:17.884]  This is religious for me.
[00:35:19.384 --> 00:35:21.965]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe in it.
[00:35:22.886 --> 00:35:26.748]  And if we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.728 --> 00:35:28.749]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:31.070]  I'm ready to give my life, everybody knows that, against the enemy.
[00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.312]  Please, we only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.772 --> 00:35:36.293]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.313 --> 00:35:37.193]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:42.215]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:43.576]  Get it today, limited run.
[00:35:43.596 --> 00:35:44.597]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.958]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.880]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.862]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great.
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:14.890]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.611]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:24.257]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5-Minute Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.337 --> 00:36:25.118]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:25.138 --> 00:36:27.480]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.121]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.682]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:33.883]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.103 --> 00:36:37.304]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:38.464]  I haven't felt sleep.
[00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:41.345]  My morning was fantastic, and I love you guys.
[00:36:41.426 --> 00:36:50.289]  I love the InfoWars crew, and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.449 --> 00:36:51.269]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:51.949]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:51.989 --> 00:36:53.310]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.997]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:58.037 --> 00:36:58.798]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:58.919 --> 00:36:59.880]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:03.666 --> 00:37:05.587]  We are in Chantilly, Virginia.
[00:37:06.007 --> 00:37:07.687]  It is the Bilderberg Conference 2017.
[00:37:08.647 --> 00:37:10.648]  It is Thursday.
[00:37:10.768 --> 00:37:13.529]  It has just kicked off and you've already got the cars.
[00:37:14.389 --> 00:37:16.470]  You've got a lot of crazy stuff going on down here, folks.
[00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.910]  But what you've got here is you've got cars coming in.
[00:37:19.211 --> 00:37:21.251]  We've seen bulletproof cars drive by.
[00:37:21.851 --> 00:37:22.411]  They come in.
[00:37:22.451 --> 00:37:23.992]  This is the entrance right down here.
[00:37:24.012 --> 00:37:25.352]  We'll show you here.
[00:37:25.392 --> 00:37:27.553]  Not too many people out here today, but there is some media out here.
[00:37:29.574 --> 00:37:33.996]  A lot of InfoWars fans out here, but here's the big story folks.
[00:37:34.936 --> 00:37:45.520]  It just came out that Donald Trump, President Donald Trump, has removed the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.
[00:37:46.361 --> 00:37:49.822]  Now this has obviously rubbed the Bilderbergers the wrong way.
[00:37:51.583 --> 00:37:54.624]  Addressing or attacking climate change has been something that
[00:37:55.014 --> 00:38:08.005]  That has always been in their purview, something that they have always wanted to use as a political power grab to tell you, to tell me that we're driving, we're men, we're killing the environment just by breathing.
[00:38:08.366 --> 00:38:10.848]  So this is a way of grabbing power from us.
[00:38:11.448 --> 00:38:14.471]  President Trump said, no, we're going to go ahead and get out of that deal.
[00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:15.632]  It's not about climate.
[00:38:15.712 --> 00:38:18.455]  It's about other countries having an advantage on America.
[00:38:18.515 --> 00:38:20.236]  That's an America first policy.
[00:38:20.717 --> 00:38:21.457]  So right now,
[00:38:22.499 --> 00:38:26.473]  As all of these elites are coming in here, they're coming in in their fancy cars.
[00:38:27.363 --> 00:38:32.185]  They're going to be meeting secretly to try to figure out what to do about President Trump.
[00:38:32.205 --> 00:38:38.329]  You see, President Trump is an anomaly because he's actually an American president.
[00:38:39.049 --> 00:38:41.690]  He is actually the president of the United States.
[00:38:42.231 --> 00:38:52.116]  Not the president of the United States representing a corptocracy, not the president of the United States representing other foreign affairs or other foreign dignitaries that they haven't made deals with.
[00:38:52.556 --> 00:38:52.716]  No.
[00:38:52.896 --> 00:39:00.241]  Well, President Trump made a deal with the American voter, with the American people, that he was going to put America first, and that would be his policy.
[00:39:00.921 --> 00:39:08.466]  So, all these Bilderbergers that have been meeting in secret for years and years and years, well they've got to do something about this.
[00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:12.949]  They've been trying to build a world that they can assume control of.
[00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:20.796]  And if you have a free and prosperous America with a roaring economy, that's not going to be possible.
[00:39:21.216 --> 00:39:32.185]  So my biggest point here, just in general, when you talk about Bilderberg and you talk about this meeting, which if you would have asked somebody 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, 40 years ago,
[00:39:34.388 --> 00:39:40.073]  50 years ago, this is the 65th Bilderberg here this year, they would have told you that you're crazy.
[00:39:40.113 --> 00:39:41.354]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:39:41.874 --> 00:39:44.196]  Bilderberg doesn't exist.
[00:39:44.636 --> 00:39:46.097]  Well, here we are.
[00:39:46.537 --> 00:39:47.858]  Clearly, it does.
[00:39:48.059 --> 00:39:52.622]  And now they celebrate it publicly as their 65th annual meeting at Bilderberg.
[00:39:53.022 --> 00:39:53.943]  Isn't that funny?
[00:39:54.343 --> 00:40:02.607]  I don't remember Alex Jones getting issued any apologies from mainstream media who said he was a conspiracy theorist for talking about Bilderberg.
[00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:04.628]  Now it's on the front page of Drudge.
[00:40:04.948 --> 00:40:06.429]  Now Donald Trump addresses it.
[00:40:06.709 --> 00:40:08.249]  Everybody knows about Bilderberg.
[00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:15.493]  So I guess we're not going to get apologies from the mainstream media who called us conspiracy theorists on that one either.
[00:40:15.773 --> 00:40:21.496]  But real quick, let's go over some of the talking points that they have admitted are going to be on the agenda for this meeting.
[00:40:22.409 --> 00:40:24.612]  First thing on the board, address President Trump.
[00:40:25.033 --> 00:40:27.676]  President Trump is the biggest obstacle.
[00:40:27.776 --> 00:40:30.900]  Love him, hate him, like his policies, dislike his policies.
[00:40:31.521 --> 00:40:36.848]  It is a fact that President Donald Trump is the biggest obstacle in the way
[00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.970]  Of course.
[00:40:54.045 --> 00:40:55.686]  That is also a threat to these people.
[00:40:55.766 --> 00:41:00.348]  That is why populism is another thing that is on their agenda.
[00:41:00.788 --> 00:41:04.490]  Last year on their agenda was the sovereign citizen.
[00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:06.671]  What are they going to do about the sovereign citizen?
[00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:08.352]  Well, they failed on that one.
[00:41:08.392 --> 00:41:10.053]  The sovereign citizen voted for Trump.
[00:41:10.073 --> 00:41:12.114]  The sovereign citizen voted for Brexit.
[00:41:12.394 --> 00:41:15.576]  Now here we are, the first Bilderberg after those two happenings.
[00:41:15.956 --> 00:41:20.340]  And they have to discuss what they're going to do about populism.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:26.505]  Another thing they're going to be talking about, I'm sure, is NATO and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:41:26.845 --> 00:41:33.070]  Donald Trump nixed the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership just by pulling off an old band-aid.
[00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:33.771]  Gone.
[00:41:33.851 --> 00:41:34.852]  I wish he would do more of that.
[00:41:35.332 --> 00:41:40.676]  NATO, he's been talking tough with, and he's been putting NATO on blast.
[00:41:40.716 --> 00:41:43.799]  He's been putting leaders of the other countries that represent NATO on blast.
[00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:54.042]  So, these are two things that the globalists have always used to, again, try to assert and gain more power on the global scale.
[00:41:54.282 --> 00:41:54.562]  Trump.
[00:41:54.962 --> 00:41:55.943]  Ended TPP.
[00:41:56.163 --> 00:41:56.443]  Trump.
[00:41:56.803 --> 00:41:58.103]  Not going along with NATO.
[00:41:58.343 --> 00:42:00.824]  These are also going to be talking points that they talk about
[00:42:01.344 --> 00:42:02.886]  Inside Bilderberg this year.
[00:42:03.186 --> 00:42:06.188]  Trump does have some team members in there, if you want to call them that.
[00:42:06.629 --> 00:42:09.271]  McMasters, Wilbur Ross, and a few others will be in there.
[00:42:09.371 --> 00:42:12.113]  You've got Eric Schmidt and other regular attendees.
[00:42:12.634 --> 00:42:18.159]  A heavy presence, a heavy banking presence, as usual, will be here.
[00:42:18.199 --> 00:42:22.943]  Goldman Sachs, I think, is represented more heavily this year than they have been in the past.
[00:42:23.343 --> 00:42:25.525]  So that's something to take note of as well.
[00:42:27.407 --> 00:42:31.632]  It'll be interesting to see if we can get any of these people to talk.
[00:42:31.712 --> 00:42:34.395]  You know, it gets more public every year.
[00:42:34.916 --> 00:42:37.399]  Bilderberg gets more public every year when it used to be a secret.
[00:42:37.439 --> 00:42:39.562]  It used to not even exist, even though it happened every year.
[00:42:40.142 --> 00:42:41.103]  But it gets more public.
[00:42:41.864 --> 00:42:44.888]  So will the people, we have the list, we know who they are, we have their names.
[00:42:44.928 --> 00:42:46.009]  In fact, even CERN
[00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:51.515]  I believe we have an Italian representative from CERN who is going to be here.
[00:42:51.595 --> 00:42:52.696]  The Hadron Collider.
[00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:53.937]  That is a big deal, folks.
[00:42:54.578 --> 00:43:11.173]  So I'm just curious, when these people that are at this meeting finally have to face the public again, they don't have all the security there, keeping the press away from them, they don't have, you know, all these trees, which by the way, this is a story, the attendees for Bilderberg this year, they're so obsessed with privacy.
[00:43:12.332 --> 00:43:16.913]  Barack Obama, who attended Bilderberg, he doesn't care about your privacy.
[00:43:16.973 --> 00:43:19.554]  He created the biggest spy state in the history of the United States.
[00:43:19.634 --> 00:43:20.374]  That's on record.
[00:43:20.434 --> 00:43:21.454]  You can't even deny that.
[00:43:21.795 --> 00:43:23.255]  But the Bilderbergers are the same way.
[00:43:23.575 --> 00:43:31.997]  You see, it wasn't enough privacy for them to rent the whole hotel, enough privacy for them to hire these nice security guards to be out here protecting the entrances.
[00:43:32.678 --> 00:43:34.618]  No, they had to plant new trees.
[00:43:35.278 --> 00:43:36.078]  That's right, folks.
[00:43:36.579 --> 00:43:38.259]  They had to plant new trees.
[00:43:38.299 --> 00:43:41.400]  You see, privacy is a very important thing to these people.
[00:43:42.503 --> 00:43:44.785]  We've had a couple people drive by here and yell things.
[00:43:44.805 --> 00:43:50.469]  I don't really know what the motivation there is, but... The story is that people know that Bilderberg is going on.
[00:43:50.529 --> 00:44:07.181]  So, when these people leave this event from this weekend, when they have to face press and media, A. Will there be press that has any spine left that's willing to address what they talked about here, ask them what they talked about about Trump, ask them what they talked about with him removing the United States from the Climate Paris Agreement,
[00:44:07.521 --> 00:44:09.742]  We know they're not going to come out here and talk to us.
[00:44:10.282 --> 00:44:13.304]  We know they're not going to talk to us when they drive through here.
[00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:19.326]  And we know that this security team is going to do their job, and if I try to walk in there, I'm probably going to get arrested.
[00:44:33.467 --> 00:44:39.711]  We will see if their feet gets held to the fire for their talking points and what they're talking about in there.
[00:44:40.191 --> 00:44:48.576]  And my final statement, before I close this brief intro out, we will be covering all weekend here from Chantilly, Virginia at InfoWars.com.
[00:44:49.414 --> 00:44:52.715]  Do a quick pan here, if you could, our cameraman here.
[00:44:53.295 --> 00:44:54.576]  I'm looking for Antifa.
[00:44:54.796 --> 00:44:56.577]  Where is Antifa?
[00:44:56.617 --> 00:44:58.097]  The anti-fascists.
[00:44:58.197 --> 00:44:58.858]  That's right.
[00:44:59.658 --> 00:45:03.519]  Private corporations merging with government to assume power.
[00:45:03.579 --> 00:45:04.540]  That's fascism.
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.521]  That's what's going on behind me here.
[00:45:06.901 --> 00:45:10.762]  You would think that Antifa would be out in droves.
[00:45:10.822 --> 00:45:16.164]  I mean, you've got George Soros funding them to go to every rally that happens under the sun.
[00:45:16.184 --> 00:45:17.625]  They get lunch, they get a bus ticket.
[00:45:18.425 --> 00:45:21.427]  Huh, Soros didn't want to pay him to come to Bilderberg this year.
[00:45:21.947 --> 00:45:22.848]  Wow, shocking.
[00:45:22.888 --> 00:45:23.568]  So that's nice.
[00:45:23.908 --> 00:45:41.259]  Antifa protests the capitalist-in-chief Donald Trump, but they won't be out here to protest the actual fascists who are meeting behind us right now to try to assume power for themselves from we the people, not just of America, but of the entire planet Earth.
[00:45:41.299 --> 00:45:42.840]  And you have to ask yourself this, folks.
[00:45:44.679 --> 00:45:55.942]  If you have a meeting of elite people, elite people in private corporations, banking, elite people in politics, lots of financial power, political power, you've got all these people meeting here.
[00:45:56.042 --> 00:45:56.322]  Why?
[00:45:56.342 --> 00:46:03.983]  Well, because they've got all this power and they've had all this success and they have all this experience, so they want to come together and make a better world, right?
[00:46:04.524 --> 00:46:05.884]  Well, I live on the world.
[00:46:06.624 --> 00:46:09.987]  You live on planet Earth, so why don't we get to have a say in this?
[00:46:10.107 --> 00:46:12.188]  Why don't we get to know what they talk about?
[00:46:12.448 --> 00:46:14.370]  Why don't they want us to know what they're talking about?
[00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:23.537]  If they really care about planet Earth, if these are really just elite human beings that are meeting to try to better planet Earth and better humanity, why don't we put cameras in there?
[00:46:23.837 --> 00:46:27.540]  Why don't they do it live on Periscope, live on YouTube, live on Facebook?
[00:46:27.781 --> 00:46:28.541]  Plenty of options.
[00:46:28.561 --> 00:46:29.602]  They know that this goes on.
[00:46:29.883 --> 00:46:30.463]  You know why?
[00:46:30.763 --> 00:46:34.327]  Because they don't want you to know what they're talking about in there, folks.
[00:46:34.407 --> 00:46:35.228]  But we already know.
[00:46:35.428 --> 00:46:43.215]  They've been talking about it for 65 years and you can now see the world government forming right in front of your face.
[00:46:43.956 --> 00:46:48.219]  Thank God the American people elected Donald Trump because if we didn't,
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:59.349]  Hillary Clinton would be shutting down this country right now, and they would all be licking their chops, getting ready to mount the head of the United States of America on their wall.
[00:46:59.589 --> 00:47:00.730]  Well, guess what, Bilderberg?
[00:47:01.191 --> 00:47:02.072]  Not today.
[00:47:02.092 --> 00:47:07.737]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.412]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.492]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.552 --> 00:48:51.152]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.512 --> 00:48:59.054]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.074 --> 00:48:59.955]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.975 --> 00:49:00.015]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.747 --> 00:49:07.848]  David Knight for InfoWars.com.
[00:49:25.302 --> 00:49:27.685]  What you see is police gathering down there.
[00:49:27.725 --> 00:49:39.001]  We walked down here, there was just one cop, and all of a sudden there was two, then four, then eight, and now we just had another five or six bicycle down this way because the four of us walked down here with cameras.
[00:49:39.758 --> 00:49:42.879]  See, this is a metaphor for what the world government is.
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.760]  It's hiding in plain sight.
[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:49.262]  Most people here in Chantilly, Virginia don't know what this is about.
[00:49:49.282 --> 00:49:50.483]  They haven't heard of Bilderberg.
[00:49:50.843 --> 00:49:52.524]  They've kept this very low profile.
[00:49:53.124 --> 00:49:57.786]  As I pointed out, there's nothing here that would tell you that anything important is going on.
[00:49:58.226 --> 00:50:01.408]  The police that are here keep this very low profile.
[00:50:01.488 --> 00:50:03.049]  We said, oh, you're here for Bilderberg?
[00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:04.829]  Well, it could be, you know.
[00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:06.130]  They won't say anything about that.
[00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:07.731]  There's not any big flags out here.
[00:50:08.532 --> 00:50:12.284]  They just keep it very low profile, but they have barricades that you can't get in now.
[00:50:13.046 --> 00:50:14.089]  Here's what's important folks.
[00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:15.594]  We have all of this
[00:50:17.312 --> 00:50:21.717]  We're trying to take down Trump saying that he's meeting with people whenever he does it.
[00:50:22.177 --> 00:50:23.699]  It's a secret back channel to the Russians.
[00:50:23.739 --> 00:50:31.246]  Whenever Barack Obama does it, they have confidential meetings that they're meeting with people, but it's nothing sinister.
[00:50:31.286 --> 00:50:32.768]  But they try to make it sound sinister.
[00:50:33.088 --> 00:50:34.910]  You want something that's sinister, that's here.
[00:50:35.631 --> 00:50:40.095]  Because when they say, and every day we have another allegation that perhaps
[00:50:41.127 --> 00:50:44.889]  Senator Sessions, before he became Attorney General, met with the Russian ambassador.
[00:50:44.969 --> 00:50:46.890]  Maybe an additional time that we didn't know about.
[00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:48.230]  What's going on here?
[00:50:48.971 --> 00:50:55.474]  We have government officials that are meeting with the captains of industry, that are meeting with the owners of mainstream media.
[00:50:55.514 --> 00:50:56.694]  The reporters are not out here.
[00:50:57.035 --> 00:50:57.775]  The owners are here.
[00:50:58.215 --> 00:51:00.256]  And their police guards are here.
[00:51:00.316 --> 00:51:01.377]  They're circling the bicycles.
[00:51:01.657 --> 00:51:03.418]  I think they're going to come down this way in just a moment.
[00:51:04.378 --> 00:51:07.899]  But one of the individuals that's here from the Trump administration is Christopher Liddell.
[00:51:08.479 --> 00:51:10.039]  He's a guy who's originally from New Zealand.
[00:51:10.079 --> 00:51:13.760]  He's worked as a chief financial officer for a lot of different American corporations, big ones.
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:15.980]  General Motors, Microsoft, and others.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:26.802]  And as he joined the Trump administration, they brought in about two dozen corporations to meet with Donald Trump to talk about what they would like to see in terms of economic policy, in terms of tax policy.
[00:51:27.222 --> 00:51:31.763]  And of course, this individual who's on the Trump team, who is a CFO, was a part of that meeting.
[00:51:32.483 --> 00:51:42.470]  Then they had people filing ethical charges against him saying he had stock or had been an employee of these other corporations or still held stock in them that was now in a blind trust.
[00:51:42.951 --> 00:51:45.272]  So he shouldn't have even been in that meeting.
[00:51:46.133 --> 00:51:51.417]  How can you say that that is an ethical violation and yet turn a blind eye?
[00:51:51.997 --> 00:51:55.358]  To the fact that we have Eric Schmidt of Google, or Alphabet.
[00:51:55.838 --> 00:52:01.160]  We have Alex Karp of Palantir, who does the data mining for the CIA.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:10.103]  How can you turn a blind eye to the fact that we have David Petraeus and others meeting in here with Henry Kissinger, meeting with government officials, meeting with foreign government officials?
[00:52:10.863 --> 00:52:12.244]  Why is that not a concern?
[00:52:12.824 --> 00:52:19.286]  Another individual who is in here, Tom Cotton, Senator Tom Cotton, a very big warmonger.
[00:52:19.346 --> 00:52:20.887]  He's a neocon.
[00:52:22.165 --> 00:52:24.267]  And also very pro-Israel.
[00:52:24.307 --> 00:52:33.195]  He was a part of the group that wrote a letter to Iran saying, even though you got a deal from Obama, don't expect that to last after the next president takes office.
[00:52:33.939 --> 00:52:38.183]  And immediately, there are many in the press who said, that's a violation of the Logan Act.
[00:52:38.444 --> 00:52:41.487]  He is not authorized to engage in foreign policy.
[00:52:41.527 --> 00:52:44.049]  He's not an individual who's supposed to conduct foreign policy.
[00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:45.731]  That is a violation of the Logan Act.
[00:52:46.332 --> 00:52:48.554]  This is a violation of the Logan Act.
[00:52:49.215 --> 00:52:53.779]  And Tom Cotton, the very individual that they claimed violated the Logan Act, is here in this meeting.
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:54.921]  Where are they?
[00:52:55.601 --> 00:52:56.803]  They're not complaining about that, are they?
[00:52:57.083 --> 00:53:03.810]  They're not complaining about the secret back channels that are being opened up between all these different corporations who are trying to cut deals.
[00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:15.781]  Elon Musk, the king of crony capitalism, this guy who's gotten over $4 billion in subsidies, this guy whose entire business model for Tesla is based on carbon credits.
[00:53:16.001 --> 00:53:18.383]  He doesn't make cars that people can afford.
[00:53:18.764 --> 00:53:25.770]  The average person buying his car has a net worth of $250,000 more, but they're subsidized in buying those cars.
[00:53:26.491 --> 00:53:31.135]  By ordinary middle-income taxpayers who cannot afford to buy his cars.
[00:53:31.695 --> 00:53:33.717]  He gets tax credits when people buy his cars.
[00:53:34.037 --> 00:53:35.739]  He gets tax credits for building the cars.
[00:53:35.959 --> 00:53:39.222]  He gets tax credits for opening up the factories.
[00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:41.544]  He got over a billion dollars in Nevada.
[00:53:41.584 --> 00:53:44.847]  He got almost 200 million dollars in California because he's green.
[00:53:45.646 --> 00:53:51.929]  And he was saying he's going to get off of the councils that he's been on with Donald Trump if Donald Trump exited the climate change agreement.
[00:53:52.009 --> 00:53:52.229]  Good.
[00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:52.969]  Good.
[00:53:53.089 --> 00:53:53.670]  I hope he does.
[00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.410]  Will he get rid of the subsidies?
[00:53:55.450 --> 00:53:57.071]  Will he forego these subsidies?
[00:53:57.631 --> 00:53:58.071]  No, he won't.
[00:53:58.672 --> 00:54:00.613]  Because what he's concerned about is not principle.
[00:54:01.153 --> 00:54:05.455]  Even the environmentalists, we don't even have to get into the argument about science.
[00:54:06.075 --> 00:54:06.135]  No.
[00:54:18.314 --> 00:54:23.517]  Advantaging certain corporations, certain banks, certain individuals like Elon Musk.
[00:54:23.917 --> 00:54:26.438]  Advantaging certain countries like China.
[00:54:27.078 --> 00:54:29.559]  When you look at people pushing back on this, they say, this is horrible.
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:34.062]  If Trump gets out of the Paris climate change, this whole thing is going to fall apart because the U.S.
[00:54:34.182 --> 00:54:38.724]  is the number two generator of these magic unicorn farts that we've got to control.
[00:54:39.044 --> 00:54:42.005]  And yet, the number one generator of that is China.
[00:54:42.285 --> 00:54:47.028]  China, under that agreement, would be allowed to continue to increase its production, even though they're number one.
[00:54:47.648 --> 00:54:54.410]  They'd be allowed to increase their pollution, from their standpoint, for many years before they even cap it.
[00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:56.590]  Before they even have to start to do reductions.
[00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:58.270]  And we see that over and over again.
[00:54:58.310 --> 00:55:00.531]  It's about a massive transfer of money.
[00:55:00.651 --> 00:55:03.051]  They say it's from the rich countries to the poor countries.
[00:55:03.131 --> 00:55:03.312]  No.
[00:55:03.872 --> 00:55:11.133]  That transfer of money is from the rich countries, the middle class of the rich countries, to a few individuals like Elon Musk.
[00:55:11.473 --> 00:55:12.274]  That's what's behind this.
[00:55:12.434 --> 00:55:13.934]  So, it's a very interesting meeting.
[00:55:14.594 --> 00:55:17.502]  Because at the same time we have some neocons like H.R.
[00:55:17.542 --> 00:55:19.949]  McMaster, we have people
[00:55:21.024 --> 00:55:32.388]  Like advisors to him who are here, who are pushing for a continuing war presence, continuing nation building, who want an eternal state of war.
[00:55:32.448 --> 00:55:35.789]  We had the first president with Barack Obama that was at war for all eight years.
[00:55:36.509 --> 00:55:41.511]  Probably Donald Trump will be too, unless he does something really radical to shut these people down.
[00:55:41.551 --> 00:55:42.691]  It doesn't look like that's going to happen.
[00:55:42.711 --> 00:55:45.532]  But even though we have these people here at this meeting,
[00:55:46.092 --> 00:55:52.054]  We're getting Donald Trump pulling out of one of the key things that would empower the world government.
[00:55:52.554 --> 00:55:58.415]  They really need these trade treaties that would have consolidated us economically, then consolidated us politically.
[00:55:58.795 --> 00:56:01.636]  And they really, really need the climate treaty.
[00:56:02.056 --> 00:56:05.097]  So I'm glad to see that he's taking this on directly.
[00:56:05.317 --> 00:56:09.898]  Of course, this took a little bit longer because he brought some snakes into his cabinet like Rex Tillerson.
[00:56:10.599 --> 00:56:13.099]  He brought in Ivanka Trump, who is pushing for this.
[00:56:13.459 --> 00:56:15.400]  And then you got Rick Perry, who says, well, let's
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:19.724]  Let's continue on with our reductions, but let's just kind of negotiate the details around.
[00:56:19.764 --> 00:56:21.526]  No, it's wrong in principle.
[00:56:22.386 --> 00:56:33.096]  And in principle, it will set up a supranational organization that will control our economy just as assuredly as the TPP or the TTIP would.
[00:56:33.137 --> 00:56:38.502]  So, if you're in Virginia and you're not here, think about coming around and showing your support for Donald Trump.
[00:56:39.127 --> 00:56:43.311]  Because these are the people who are trying to truly hack the election.
[00:56:43.771 --> 00:56:47.034]  It's not the Russians, it's the people who are meeting here at Bilderberg.
[00:56:47.194 --> 00:56:48.816]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:56:52.298 --> 00:57:10.465]  Well, that was a great report from David Knight, who's out there right now in Chantilly, Virginia, covering the Bilderberg Conference, where these globalists are all getting together, conspiring on how they're going to take out the Trump administration, and how they're going to stop InfoWars.
[00:57:10.505 --> 00:57:14.246]  They actually had a section in there about the war on information.
[00:57:14.286 --> 00:57:18.028]  I mean, they might as well have just said, we need to take out InfoWars.
[00:57:18.428 --> 00:57:18.748]  And that's
[00:57:34.654 --> 00:57:47.018]  Please go to Infowarsstore.com, support us, support the broadcast, and make sure you get yourself some of that shampoo, the Emrix shampoo, so you can have some awesome hair.
[00:57:47.298 --> 00:57:55.180]  They have a nice starter pack of Emrix essentials, where you can get mouthwash, shampoo, SPF suntan lotion,
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.701]  I think so.
[00:58:12.737 --> 00:58:28.086]  Our ability to continue broadcasting the truth and information as the mainstream media, the fake news media, are out there continuing to peddle fake news and keep the population under mind control and dumbed down.
[00:58:28.386 --> 00:58:31.728]  So, so far Donald Trump has been doing an amazing job.
[00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:38.372]  I mean, he just pulled out of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, which I'm sure has the globalists in
[00:58:38.652 --> 00:58:39.694]  FURIATED!
[00:58:40.155 --> 00:58:47.248]  So David Knight and Owen Troy will be keeping you guys updated and thank you guys for watching the InfoWars Nightly News!
