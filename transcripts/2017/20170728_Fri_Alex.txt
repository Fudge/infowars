[00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.141]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:21.742]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:47.578]  It is Friday, July 28, 2017.
[00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:51.904]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones.
[00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:53.526]  Huge show today.
[00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.950]  We've got Tommy Robinson coming up in the second hour.
[00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.298]  He's got a new book out telling people what's really in the Quran, the truth about the religion of peace.
[00:01:03.338 --> 00:01:05.201]  That's going to be interesting in the second hour.
[00:01:05.953 --> 00:01:07.976]  For the time being, we've got big breaking news.
[00:01:08.077 --> 00:01:11.522]  Terror in Germany has struck again.
[00:01:11.643 --> 00:01:18.935]  This isn't really being reported by many of the big news agencies because they'd rather just gloss over it and pretend everything's hunky-dory.
[00:01:19.927 --> 00:01:27.449]  In Merkelland, as she imports millions more refugees, one killed, multiple injured in Hamburg knife attack.
[00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:28.589]  That is out of RT.
[00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:35.771]  One person has been killed and several others injured in a bloody knife attack at a supermarket in Hamburg, Germany.
[00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:38.852]  According to local police, the suspect has been arrested.
[00:01:38.872 --> 00:01:42.713]  However, officials have declined to comment on a possible motive.
[00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:44.533]  Oh gee, I wonder.
[00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:57.766]  No possible motive suspected here, despite the fact that the eyewitnesses on the scene said that this individual shouted, you guessed it, Allah Akbar, during the rampage.
[00:01:57.806 --> 00:02:01.749]  So we have at least one person dead right now, several injured.
[00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.891]  It looks like the suspect has thankfully been apprehended.
[00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.713]  It looks like yet another Islamic terror attack.
[00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:18.803]  In Merkel land, the land of 2 million plus refugees, economic migrants in reality, since 2015 and just look at what is happening.
[00:02:18.823 --> 00:02:24.488]  We're going to get more into that later in regards to the migrant crisis because there is just a deluge of news on that.
[00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.595]  Also breaking at this hour though, this is also out of RT, North Korea believed to have conducted new missile tests
[00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:40.375]  North Korea is believed to have conducted a new missile test, Japanese national public broadcaster NHK reported today, citing government officials.
[00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:44.597]  It looks like it landed in the Sea of Japan once again.
[00:02:44.957 --> 00:02:52.162]  Whether this will be the spark that entails new military action potentially against North Korea, we'll wait and see.
[00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:53.402]  Usually doesn't, does it?
[00:02:53.442 --> 00:02:57.985]  It usually just drags on until the next missile incident and nothing really happens.
[00:02:58.065 --> 00:03:01.247]  Tensions continue to simmer, but that is also breaking
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.922]  At this hour.
[00:03:03.603 --> 00:03:10.274]  Now one of the top stories up on m4wars.com right now is a new development on a story we've been tracking all week.
[00:03:10.334 --> 00:03:15.423]  The headline is PASTA confirms plot to take out Trump is physical.
[00:03:16.338 --> 00:03:32.841]  As the deep state democratic coup against the legitimately elected president intensifies, we have more details on this potential assassination plot against the president being cooked up from within the dark underbelly of the deep state.
[00:03:33.141 --> 00:03:38.323]  This is of course Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown, who appeared on the show with Alex a couple of days ago.
[00:03:38.923 --> 00:03:40.183]  After he went public,
[00:03:40.723 --> 00:03:49.009]  With how he was told by a senior Republican congressman of a plot to quote take out President Trump in the near future.
[00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:57.376]  Now he's made it even more explicit in these new comments that that meant to physically remove the President.
[00:03:57.796 --> 00:04:01.719]  Not through indictment, not through impeachment, not through some kind of political protest.
[00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:04.421]  To physically remove the President
[00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:07.843]  He went on to talk about the John Hinckley Jr.
[00:04:07.903 --> 00:04:15.026]  assassination attempt against Ronald Reagan, how that changed Ronald Reagan's direction back in the 80s.
[00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:31.535]  So again, whether this supposed assassination plot, and we've been talking about this story for months now, given how the media, given how the dominant culture is placing this in the public's mind, that this is inevitable that someone will try and assassinate Donald Trump,
[00:04:32.228 --> 00:04:37.490]  Given that build-up, given that lead-up, could we see an attempt in the near future?
[00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:45.472]  That's what a lot of people are warning about, including this prominent pastor who now has confirmed that this threat, this plan, was physical.
[00:04:45.972 --> 00:04:51.554]  Of course, he was interrogated to some extent by the Secret Service after he made these comments.
[00:04:51.594 --> 00:04:53.174]  He actually made them over a week ago.
[00:04:53.594 --> 00:04:55.155]  It only really intensified when
[00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.676]  Infowars.com picked up the story, but he's now confirming that that is a physical plot.
[00:05:01.716 --> 00:05:03.497]  We'll be back after the break with more news.
[00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:09.984]  Every article, every video, but especially these articles and videos we've been breaking down.
[00:05:11.593 --> 00:05:18.178]  Dealing with the martial law, civil war, assassination, removal, sudden removal, coup of Trump.
[00:05:18.658 --> 00:05:20.540]  All of this is now confirmed.
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.762]  Talk about sensationally fantastic.
[00:05:25.143 --> 00:05:26.825]  Talk about living in incredible times.
[00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:30.147]  Talk about America and the world at the crossroads.
[00:05:30.187 --> 00:05:30.688]  This is it.
[00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:34.290]  And now, more than ever, we need your financial support.
[00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.332]  We have the very best products you need.
[00:05:36.732 --> 00:05:39.254]  Incredible air filtration systems that are $219.
[00:05:39.294 --> 00:05:39.654]  Similar units are $400, $600.
[00:05:39.734 --> 00:05:40.995]  These are like 800 a few years ago.
[00:05:41.035 --> 00:05:41.836]  The prices are going down.
[00:05:41.856 --> 00:05:42.336]  They're $149 right now.
[00:05:49.401 --> 00:05:50.562]  $149, normally $219.
[00:05:50.662 --> 00:05:53.024]  That is the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:56.107]  The very same type systems, again, are $400 on average, upwards of $600.
[00:05:56.387 --> 00:05:59.490]  Pro Pure Travel are the very best gravity-fed systems out there.
[00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.930]  30% off, $132.
[00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.653]  The other competitors aren't even as good, and they sell them for $200, $230.
[00:06:02.773 --> 00:06:03.233]  That's $132 right now.
[00:06:07.637 --> 00:06:10.859]  Super Silver Special, the electric toothbrush that has silver impregnated in it.
[00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:11.699]  Amazing.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.701]  And the Ployol Silver toothpaste.
[00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:17.243]  Super Blue and the Silver Bullet Ployol Silver.
[00:06:17.623 --> 00:06:17.843]  50% off.
[00:06:18.103 --> 00:06:19.184]  We've never done a special that big.
[00:06:19.544 --> 00:06:21.705]  Caveman Combo, 25% off the bone broth.
[00:06:21.845 --> 00:06:24.087]  Super Female, 57% off.
[00:06:24.147 --> 00:06:24.787]  And why is that?
[00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:26.868]  Because we're basically sold out of the Super Male.
[00:06:26.968 --> 00:06:27.909]  I can't discount that.
[00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:30.991]  Super Female is very, very similar and works on men as well.
[00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:31.871]  But I want women.
[00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.472]  I've never really caught on with women for some reason.
[00:06:33.652 --> 00:06:33.952]  You should.
[00:06:34.052 --> 00:06:36.814]  It's even more dramatic than what I've seen in women, when it comes to libido at least.
[00:06:37.074 --> 00:06:39.095]  But stamina, energy, just read the reviews.
[00:06:39.295 --> 00:06:41.416]  Super female, 57% off.
[00:06:41.596 --> 00:06:44.158]  And so many other big specials, DNA 4, 20% off.
[00:06:44.498 --> 00:06:46.439]  Free shipping until the end of this month.
[00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:50.241]  That's only a few more days and the huge sales of July are over.
[00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:56.845]  Please support the broadcast, support yourself, and help fund the InfoWar in the face of this oppressive assault because we're having victory.
[00:06:56.945 --> 00:06:58.926]  InfoWarStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:06:58.946 --> 00:06:59.586]  Thanks for your support.
[00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:08.248]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:07:08.308 --> 00:07:19.240]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.342]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:07:24.442 --> 00:07:26.963]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:07:27.023 --> 00:07:28.524]  It helps detoxify.
[00:07:28.744 --> 00:07:31.585]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:36.367]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:07:36.387 --> 00:07:42.629]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:47.971]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:07:48.092 --> 00:07:48.752]  I'm taking it now.
[00:07:49.692 --> 00:07:51.433]  This is the National Emergency.
[00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:53.014]  Important instructions will follow.
[00:07:53.234 --> 00:07:53.535]  Shots fired.
[00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:27.544]  This message is transmitted at the request of the President of the United States of America and the Office of Homeland Security.
[00:08:28.004 --> 00:08:32.986]  In compliance with the United Nations, the President of the United States has declared martial law.
[00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:34.646]  Curfew is now in place.
[00:08:35.006 --> 00:08:36.087]  Return to your homes.
[00:09:12.872 --> 00:09:16.753]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:09:18.417 --> 00:09:19.638]  We are live.
[00:09:19.718 --> 00:09:22.620]  This is the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.903]  Now, what's the biggest story in the United States right now?
[00:09:26.063 --> 00:09:27.004]  Is it the fight?
[00:09:27.464 --> 00:09:32.609]  The three-way would-be cage match between Scaramucci, Bannon and Reince Priebus?
[00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:33.129]  No.
[00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.611]  Is it the Russian collusion?
[00:09:34.731 --> 00:09:35.532]  Nothing, Berger.
[00:09:35.832 --> 00:09:35.972]  No.
[00:09:36.032 --> 00:09:52.344]  No, it's actually this, which has received no attention whatsoever from any other mainstream network than Fox News, despite the fact that this is clearly the most intriguing, most potentially damaging, the biggest story that has emerged this week.
[00:09:53.064 --> 00:09:55.166]  This is out of Gateway Pundit to set the scene.
[00:09:55.566 --> 00:10:04.032]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz, absolute wreck, barely able to function since Imran Awan's arrest.
[00:10:04.608 --> 00:10:19.099]  Now, to give you the backstory, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, former head of the DNC, employed Pakistani IT staffers and brothers who were paid over $4 million over the course of their employment, even though they were accused of a cyber security breach.
[00:10:19.119 --> 00:10:24.143]  A number of other criminal accusations against one of the brothers as well, which we'll get into later.
[00:10:24.163 --> 00:10:26.885]  Imran Awan was arrested
[00:10:27.392 --> 00:10:34.058]  After he attempted to flee the US after wiring approximately $300,000 to Pakistan.
[00:10:34.398 --> 00:10:38.281]  And again, Fox News is the only cable network covering this huge scandal.
[00:10:38.602 --> 00:10:43.366]  When Imran Awam was arrested, he was carrying $12,000 of cash on him.
[00:10:43.426 --> 00:10:44.627]  That's not suspicious at all.
[00:10:45.127 --> 00:10:49.351]  His wife was carrying $12,000 of cash as well when she fled the country.
[00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:55.683]  So basically, these individuals had high security access to the DNC computers.
[00:10:55.924 --> 00:10:59.046]  They had the password to Wasserman Schultz's iPad.
[00:10:59.346 --> 00:11:01.228]  They had direct access to all that.
[00:11:02.017 --> 00:11:06.720]  The guy smashed his hard drive before the FBI was able to descend on him.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.601]  This is a massive scandal.
[00:11:09.041 --> 00:11:20.729]  Now it turns out, and we're going to get to this clip in a moment, that this has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, with these individuals potentially colluding with a terrorist organisation
[00:11:21.309 --> 00:11:24.970]  While having direct access, secure access to the DNC.
[00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.910]  You want to talk about collusion with a foreign power?
[00:11:28.191 --> 00:11:32.091]  You want to talk about collusion with a foreign terrorist entity?
[00:11:32.732 --> 00:11:33.332]  This is it.
[00:11:33.772 --> 00:11:34.372]  Right here.
[00:11:34.392 --> 00:11:42.574]  There's more evidence for this than there is for Russian collusion and Donald Trump, yet that is the story they're talking about on CNN.
[00:11:42.874 --> 00:11:44.554]  They den-touched it.
[00:11:45.774 --> 00:11:48.495]  Now we go back to March and we've got this video clip lined up
[00:11:49.139 --> 00:12:05.726]  When this investigation first emerged, bearing in mind she actually employed these guys after this, for months afterwards, the headline, the original Daily Caller headline from back in March, Wasserman Schultz threatened police chief for gathering evidence on her IT staffers' alleged crimes.
[00:12:06.346 --> 00:12:15.650]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the US Capitol Police with, quote, consequences for holding equipment that she says belonged to her
[00:12:16.405 --> 00:12:34.470]  And again, bearing in mind this is before the evidence of them smashing up hard drives came out, what she says belongs to her in order to build a criminal case against a Pakistani staffer suspected of massive cyber security breaches involving funneling sensitive congressional data off-site.
[00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:41.031]  Not only off-site, but now it turns out potentially directly to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:12:41.251 --> 00:12:43.512]  The Florida lawmaker used her position
[00:12:44.469 --> 00:12:56.394]  On the committee that sets the police force's budget to press its chief to relinquish the piece of evidence in what could be considered using her authority to attempt to interfere with a criminal investigation.
[00:12:56.834 --> 00:12:59.075]  No scandal about that back in March.
[00:12:59.455 --> 00:13:00.496]  Now this is blown up.
[00:13:00.776 --> 00:13:09.840]  Let's go back to March and play that clip where Wasserman Schultz directly threatens the Capitol Police with, quote, consequences if they don't drop this.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.360]  Here's the clip.
[00:13:11.752 --> 00:13:20.299]  It is not, under my understanding, the Capitol Police is not able to confiscate members' equipment when the member is not under investigation.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.042]  It is their equipment and it's supposed to be returned.
[00:13:24.457 --> 00:13:41.827]  Well, I think there's extenuating circumstances in this case, and I think that, you know, working through my counsel and, you know, the necessary personnel, if that in fact is the case, and with the permission of, through the investigation, we'll return the equipment.
[00:13:42.307 --> 00:13:46.109]  But until that's accomplished, I can't return the equipment.
[00:13:46.149 --> 00:13:49.811]  I think you're violating the rules when you conduct your business that way.
[00:13:50.832 --> 00:13:52.973]  And you'd expect that there would be consequences.
[00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:55.376]  There you have it.
[00:13:55.476 --> 00:13:56.497]  Consequences.
[00:13:57.177 --> 00:14:00.901]  Four months later, this guy has smashed up his hard drive.
[00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:09.309]  He's fled the country after wiring nearly $300,000 from the Congressional Federal Credit Union to Pakistan.
[00:14:09.709 --> 00:14:13.373]  Now we're finding out he has direct links with the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:14:13.994 --> 00:14:17.557]  She employed him for months after this investigation began.
[00:14:17.577 --> 00:14:19.439]  Here's another headline out of Gateway Pundit.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.001]  That's weird.
[00:14:21.381 --> 00:14:26.665]  Wasserman Schultz paid Imran Awan for five months after he was banned from house computers.
[00:14:27.006 --> 00:14:29.087]  Why is she still employing this guy?
[00:14:29.648 --> 00:14:32.090]  Multiple criminal charges leveled against him.
[00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:33.771]  Now he's wired 300,000.
[00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:35.653]  He's tried to flee the country.
[00:14:35.873 --> 00:14:37.534]  He smashed up his hard drives.
[00:14:37.895 --> 00:14:39.376]  What on earth is going on here?
[00:14:39.696 --> 00:14:41.418]  Why is nobody reporting on this?
[00:14:42.058 --> 00:14:47.843]  Three brothers who managed office IT for government officials were relieved of their duties in February.
[00:14:48.562 --> 00:14:53.485]  On suspicion that they access specific computer networks without permission, also known as hacking.
[00:14:54.485 --> 00:15:00.848]  And again, remember the entire hysteria we've had for the past six, seven, eight months is Russia hacked the DNC.
[00:15:01.309 --> 00:15:10.193]  Well, here we have individuals with direct ties to terrorist organizations, also with direct access to the DNC, literally with the passwords.
[00:15:10.673 --> 00:15:12.915]  This is the biggest scandal since Seth Rich.
[00:15:13.255 --> 00:15:17.397]  It's getting no attention whatsoever, nowhere near the attention it should have received.
[00:15:18.382 --> 00:15:27.784]  Debbie Wasserman Schultz continued to pay Imran Awan for five months for IT services after he was banned from house computers.
[00:15:28.499 --> 00:15:35.224]  According to reports earlier this week, Imran Awan was still employed by Wasserman Schultz after his arrest on Monday night.
[00:15:35.704 --> 00:15:42.469]  David Damron, spokesman for Wasserman Schultz, told Fox News reporter Chad Pergram that Awan was terminated on Tuesday.
[00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.192]  Five months after this came out, he was still employed by her.
[00:15:46.652 --> 00:15:49.574]  So why was Imran still being paid?
[00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:52.216]  Wasserman Schultz has some explaining to do.
[00:15:53.137 --> 00:15:54.598]  Fast forward to last night,
[00:15:55.330 --> 00:16:01.912]  Where Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaffer appeared on Tucker Carlson's show, hosted by filling host Laura Ingram.
[00:16:03.273 --> 00:16:09.875]  Just when you thought the case surrounding the Awan brothers could not get any darker, a new piece of news emerges.
[00:16:10.435 --> 00:16:21.920]  Lieutenant Colonel Tony Schaffer revealed to Laura Ingram that Pakistani IT staffers were sending sensitive information to the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.900]  Let's go to the clip.
[00:16:23.746 --> 00:16:27.228]  So that's why the Capitol Hill police rolled in saying there's something wrong here.
[00:16:27.549 --> 00:16:28.970]  And now the FBI has rolled in.
[00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.572]  And let me give you the big takeaway here.
[00:16:32.872 --> 00:16:36.074]  It looks like a foreign intelligence service may be the recipient of all this.
[00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:38.336]  And something called the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:16:39.196 --> 00:16:39.857]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:16:39.877 --> 00:16:40.958]  The Muslim Brotherhood?
[00:16:41.798 --> 00:16:43.941]  Oh, they're going to really say it's a conspiracy theory now.
[00:16:43.981 --> 00:16:47.284]  It's really a conspiracy now, but that's where apparently all this has been going in law enforcement.
[00:16:47.304 --> 00:16:50.288]  That's why the FBI is now investigating beyond the waterfall.
[00:16:50.308 --> 00:16:59.378]  Well, these brothers have been kicking around Capitol Hill in various capacities for IT, but they essentially were blacklisted by most of the other Democrats, correct?
[00:16:59.438 --> 00:16:59.879]  Precisely.
[00:16:59.899 --> 00:17:00.239]  That's correct.
[00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.560]  So there you have it.
[00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:36.793]  Direct connections feeding intel to the Muslim Brotherhood while having secure high-level access within the DNC, wiring $300,000 to Pakistan, smashing up hard drives.
[00:17:37.254 --> 00:17:44.856]  Bear in mind the Muslim Brotherhood is basically the umbrella, the parent organisation for terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and Hamas.
[00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:52.398]  Looks like these guys are working for them and they're running Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC's IT.
[00:17:53.385 --> 00:17:57.606]  With direct password to her iPad to all the secure systems.
[00:17:57.926 --> 00:18:05.249]  How is that not a massive foreign government, foreign terrorist organisation collusion scandal?
[00:18:05.529 --> 00:18:07.469]  That is absolutely huge.
[00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:13.491]  That is a giant scandal, bigger than anything that's come out of this Russia-Trump collusion investigation.
[00:18:14.432 --> 00:18:15.772]  It's being covered nowhere.
[00:18:16.012 --> 00:18:17.753]  Fox News and that is it.
[00:18:18.413 --> 00:18:18.773]  I mean the
[00:18:19.767 --> 00:18:31.618]  Conservative media, the online media, have been talking about it all week, relentlessly, trying to push it into the headlines, trying to force the likes of CNN just to cover it, even if it's to dismiss it.
[00:18:32.159 --> 00:18:33.520]  Nothing, nothing whatsoever.
[00:18:34.521 --> 00:18:36.143]  Now this gets even more bizarre because
[00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:39.320]  Imran Awan's attorney actually came out.
[00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:57.130]  His defence, even after the smashed up hard drives, wiring $300,000 to Pakistan, the links to the Muslim Brotherhood, him and his wife carrying 12 grand in cash through an airport or attempting to, even after all that and all the other criminal charges against him,
[00:18:58.499 --> 00:19:00.299]  He blamed Islamophobia.
[00:19:00.459 --> 00:19:01.700]  Yes, you guessed it.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.760]  None of that is evidence.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:04.961]  Ignore all that.
[00:19:05.281 --> 00:19:05.481]  No.
[00:19:05.761 --> 00:19:11.082]  The reason he's being persecuted, the reason he's being arrested, is because of Islamophobia.
[00:19:11.682 --> 00:19:13.883]  The right wing, and wait for it, wait for it.
[00:19:14.563 --> 00:19:15.343]  Pizzagate.
[00:19:15.643 --> 00:19:20.904]  Yes, he actually mentioned Pizzagate as one of the reasons for this guy being arrested.
[00:19:21.245 --> 00:19:22.945]  That's his lawyer's defence.
[00:19:23.721 --> 00:19:25.162]  None of these charges are true.
[00:19:25.222 --> 00:19:26.423]  None of it even exists.
[00:19:26.743 --> 00:19:30.306]  The only reason he's been persecuted is because of Islamophobia.
[00:19:30.706 --> 00:19:47.739]  Once again, they turn to identity politics, literally, to try to wriggle out of criminal charges, a massive scandal involving foreign collusion, deep access to the IT systems of the DNC, and even collusion with a foreign terrorist group.
[00:19:49.075 --> 00:19:50.497]  Absolutely huge scandal.
[00:19:50.838 --> 00:19:53.463]  There's more on this and we're going to get to that after the break.
[00:19:53.523 --> 00:19:55.227]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:19:55.688 --> 00:19:57.712]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:57.732 --> 00:19:58.393]  Don't go away.
[00:19:58.413 --> 00:19:59.055]  We'll be back.
[00:20:04.357 --> 00:20:12.907]  Of the 30-plus proprietary products that we've developed for InfoWarsLife.com, which are all amazing, DNA Force is the flagship.
[00:20:13.287 --> 00:20:21.857]  This highly advanced formula has been sold out for close to six months due to a worldwide shortage of the sought-after ingredients.
[00:20:22.197 --> 00:20:39.365]  Today I'm very excited to announce that we have received a limited shipment of DNA Force and despite the fact that we have been sold out for close to six months, I'm still discounting it 20% because I want listeners and viewers that haven't tried DNA Force yet to actually get a chance to see how amazing it is.
[00:20:39.645 --> 00:20:53.372]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systemic enzymes, NaR lipoic acid, BioPQQ, and many, many others that synergistically work together.

[00:22:04.605 --> 00:22:09.467]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:22:10.567 --> 00:22:27.713]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community, is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:22:28.493 --> 00:22:36.363]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:22:36.704 --> 00:22:45.935]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[00:22:46.716 --> 00:22:52.919]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[00:22:53.339 --> 00:23:07.085]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[00:23:07.845 --> 00:23:18.217]  Bottom line, when you purchase Caveman at InfoWarsTore.com, you're supporting the broadcast and true independent media that's fighting for the future of this country to be a free nation.

[00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:25.545]  But you really should try it for yourself to see what it's done for myself and so many others.
[00:23:26.326 --> 00:23:28.608]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:23:28.728 --> 00:23:29.989]  We're getting results.
[00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:37.295]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.

[00:24:18.357 --> 00:24:27.864]  Live on the Alex Jones Show, coming up in the next segment, we have Roger Stone joining us with huge breaking news regarding all things President Trump.
[00:24:27.904 --> 00:24:28.805]  We're going to get into that.
[00:24:28.825 --> 00:24:41.014]  We're also going to get back to the huge scandal regarding the Pakistani IT staffer arrested after having smashed his hard drive, tried to wire $300,000 to Pakistan and was actually successful in doing so.
[00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:45.311]  First I want to tell you about the last week of July specials.

[00:25:01.577 --> 00:25:06.001]  I mean, there's such a deluge of hit pieces every single day, we don't even get the chance to talk about them.
[00:25:06.222 --> 00:25:07.062]  And why should we?
[00:25:07.283 --> 00:25:08.944]  Why should we always be on the defensive?
[00:25:08.964 --> 00:25:14.930]  We should get on the offensive, and we've been able to remain on the offensive with the help of you getting the products.

[00:26:45.443 --> 00:26:49.789]  Now we were talking about the break before the break about the Pakistani IT staffers.
[00:26:50.538 --> 00:27:01.782]  One of whom has now been arrested by the FBI after having wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan, after having smashed up his hard drives, numerous criminal charges against him.
[00:27:02.342 --> 00:27:09.404]  Again, he was working with and had direct access to the DNC's computers with Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had her passwords!
[00:27:10.208 --> 00:27:16.630]  Now the link to the terrorist umbrella organisation, the Muslim Brotherhood, has emerged.
[00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:22.492]  Oh, but the real reason he's being persecuted, according to his lawyer, is Islamophobia.
[00:27:22.692 --> 00:27:23.152]  That's right.
[00:27:23.493 --> 00:27:25.973]  They even mentioned Pizzagate.
[00:27:26.554 --> 00:27:30.355]  Which is kind of ironic, given this next story from Gateway Pundit.
[00:27:31.255 --> 00:27:32.596]  Headline, it gets worse.
[00:27:32.696 --> 00:27:39.438]  Wasserman Schultz IT staffer Imran Awan subscribed to paedophile-centric YouTube channels.
[00:27:40.589 --> 00:27:41.150]  Oh really?
[00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:49.819]  So he's blaming Pizzagate, which was a scandal, an alleged scandal about paedophiles, and this guy is subscribed to paedophile-centric YouTube channels.
[00:27:49.859 --> 00:27:50.480]  How ironic.
[00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:57.514]  With each passing day, we learn more and more about the dark and murky past of Pakistan IT staffer Imran Awan.
[00:27:57.855 --> 00:28:15.428]  The former employee of Debbie Wasserman Schultz is not only being accused of stealing hardware from ranking Democrats and sending sensitive intel to foreign groups like the Muslim Brotherhood, but it now appears Awan may have been interested in watching paedophile-centric YouTube videos.
[00:28:15.928 --> 00:28:20.289]  They actually went and looked and it's... You can do this with anyone who owns a YouTube account.
[00:28:20.329 --> 00:28:21.910]  You can look at who they subscribe to.
[00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.771]  It's the function that can't be hidden as far as I'm aware.
[00:28:26.231 --> 00:28:32.973]  Pretty stupid that he didn't try to hide it or didn't try to just unsubscribe from these channels because they're basically disgusting.
[00:28:33.293 --> 00:28:43.056]  YouTuber Tracy Beans has discovered that the Pakistani DNC IT staffer arrested Monday night for bank fraud while attempting to flee the country was a fan
[00:28:43.832 --> 00:28:50.936]  ...of several pedocentric YouTube channels, including one featured on Comedy Central's Tosh.0 program.
[00:28:51.396 --> 00:29:05.003]  Imran Awam, the longtime employee and friend of Wasserman Schultz, subscribed to YouTube channel Seven Super Girls, which has over 12 billion views and features children performing in sexualized bits.
[00:29:05.023 --> 00:29:12.487]  So, as far as I know, these are basically these channels which Google has made moves to shut down, or at least they've been under pressure to shut down,
[00:29:13.027 --> 00:29:16.530]  Where it's basically sanitized child porn.
[00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:20.292]  It's children engaged in sexualized situations.
[00:29:20.673 --> 00:29:29.599]  This guy was subscribed to these channels while his lawyer blames conspiracy theorists who complain about Pizzagate paedophiles.
[00:29:29.899 --> 00:29:34.683]  He's actually subscribed to proto-paedophile YouTube channels.
[00:29:35.593 --> 00:29:37.634]  Absolutely insane situation.
[00:29:37.874 --> 00:29:39.315]  This is a huge scandal.
[00:29:39.515 --> 00:29:41.336]  It has ties into everything.
[00:29:41.376 --> 00:29:43.358]  We're learning more every single day.
[00:29:44.038 --> 00:29:47.660]  CNN, ABC, MSNBC refuse to cover it.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.242]  We'll be back after the break with Roger Stone.
[00:29:50.282 --> 00:29:50.982]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:29:51.002 --> 00:29:52.023]  Infowars.com.
[00:29:52.743 --> 00:29:53.624]  We're on the march.
[00:29:54.124 --> 00:29:55.725]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.745 --> 00:29:59.347]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.344 --> 00:30:16.476]  Since the time of Hippocrates, the father of modern western medicine, in 420 BC, the ancients have marveled at the power of whey protein from milk and cheese.
[00:30:16.656 --> 00:30:24.024]  That's why I'm so proud to announce the latest addition to the InfoWars Life family, true whey protein from InfoWars Life.
[00:30:24.344 --> 00:30:30.288]  It's produced right here in the United States of America under the strictest high quality organic conditions.
[00:30:30.848 --> 00:30:37.593]  Our True Whey Protein from InfoWars Life contains a whopping 20 grams of protein per serving.
[00:30:38.033 --> 00:30:45.218]  We went out and did massive research and found the very best company and facility to develop our whey.
[00:30:45.418 --> 00:30:58.062]  And it took us years to finally get contacts with some of the larger, most respected companies to bring you a super high quality whey protein at a very reasonable price.
[00:30:58.562 --> 00:31:06.125]  That way you get the benefits and the taste of high quality whey while supporting our information warfare operation against the globalists.
[00:31:06.445 --> 00:31:08.966]  Doing our research, one thing continues to really stand out.
[00:31:09.506 --> 00:31:18.170]  It's not just that cows and their milk are associated with the best, highest quality protein, but also that those cows be grass-fed.
[00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:19.411]  That is essential.
[00:31:19.791 --> 00:31:24.073]  And all of this whey protein comes from grass-fed, happy cows.
[00:31:24.573 --> 00:31:27.014]  This is the very best whey that we were able to bring to market.
[00:31:27.374 --> 00:31:29.115]  Please try it for yourself and tell us what you think.
[00:31:29.195 --> 00:31:30.835]  Again, thank you so much for all your support.
[00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:33.877]  It is true whey from mfullwashlife.com.
[00:31:34.497 --> 00:31:38.040]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:44.525]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:31:44.946 --> 00:31:47.748]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[00:31:48.128 --> 00:31:51.111]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:31:51.331 --> 00:31:54.752]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:31:55.093 --> 00:31:56.853]  The left controls culture.
[00:31:56.873 --> 00:31:57.854]  They control arts.
[00:31:57.934 --> 00:31:59.154]  They control entertainment.
[00:31:59.454 --> 00:32:06.537]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:32:06.597 --> 00:32:08.998]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:32:09.478 --> 00:32:13.340]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.461]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[00:32:16.081 --> 00:32:21.463]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[00:32:21.723 --> 00:32:27.965]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:32:28.046 --> 00:32:29.726]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:32:29.886 --> 00:32:31.067]  It's available right now.
[00:32:31.387 --> 00:32:33.628]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:33.668 --> 00:32:40.370]  You've got to have the will to accept the truth and fuck the system and the group collective.
[00:32:41.491 --> 00:32:45.172]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:47.691]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:33:06.218 --> 00:33:12.805]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.205 --> 00:33:16.908]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:33:21.528 --> 00:33:26.674]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show, top of the next hour.
[00:33:26.714 --> 00:33:29.978]  We've got Tommy Robinson coming on as a regular guest.
[00:33:30.338 --> 00:33:31.940]  I'm excited to talk to him again.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.641]  It's been a while.
[00:33:33.262 --> 00:33:36.445]  But for the moment, we have another man who needs no introduction.
[00:33:36.465 --> 00:33:38.688]  The website is Stone Cold Truth.
[00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:40.690]  It's Roger Stone.
[00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:46.157]  Roger, before the break I was talking about this huge scandal that no one is covering besides Fox News.
[00:33:46.517 --> 00:33:53.887]  We have Debbie Wasserman Schultz as former IT staffer of the DNC and she only fired him
[00:33:54.487 --> 00:34:01.113]  After he was arrested, months after all these criminal charges were against him, he wires $300,000 to Pakistan.
[00:34:01.394 --> 00:34:03.535]  He's found with smashed up hard drives.
[00:34:03.876 --> 00:34:08.540]  This is a guy who has direct access to the IT servers at the DNC.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.342]  He's colluding potentially with a foreign government.
[00:34:11.663 --> 00:34:19.290]  He's colluding potentially, as Tony Schafer said last night, with the Muslim Brotherhood terrorist organisation.
[00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:20.531]  How on earth
[00:34:21.131 --> 00:34:22.732]  Is this not a bigger scandal?
[00:34:22.772 --> 00:34:27.014]  How on earth have the likes of CNN been able to ignore this huge story?
[00:34:28.495 --> 00:34:29.515]  You're absolutely right, Paul.
[00:34:29.575 --> 00:34:30.496]  It's extraordinary.
[00:34:30.536 --> 00:34:32.957]  In fact, it's even slightly worse than you depicted it.
[00:34:33.357 --> 00:34:38.560]  After the Capitol Hill police launched their investigation into these two Pakistani brothers,
[00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:52.460]  Jennifer Wasserman Schultz changed their classification from consultants to employees of the House of Representatives to ensure that they would continue to have access to the House of Representatives' computer system.
[00:34:53.401 --> 00:34:56.343]  So she has abetted whatever they were up to.
[00:34:56.363 --> 00:34:58.565]  She refuses to take questions.
[00:34:58.985 --> 00:35:06.632]  She berated the Capitol Hill police chief for launching the investigation, demanding a return of the hard drives from her office.
[00:35:07.444 --> 00:35:17.151]  Interestingly, she also introduced these two brothers to 19 other Democratic members of Congress, who then opened their I.T.
[00:35:17.211 --> 00:35:37.224]  contracts to them, meaning that they burrowed deep into the Democratic caucus, getting access to all of that information, including, obviously, financial information, because the Capitol Hill police investigation was a bank fraud, an electronic, you know, wired theft.
[00:35:37.264 --> 00:35:38.105]  We're good.
[00:35:49.142 --> 00:35:59.925]  It appears Republicans will nominate Carla Spaulding, an Asian-American Republican woman who is a registered nurse, has a master's degree, a single mother with three children.
[00:36:00.365 --> 00:36:04.426]  Very attractive, very articulate, liberty Republican.
[00:36:05.526 --> 00:36:11.908]  And like the race against Maxine Waters, this is going to be about corruption rather than ideology.
[00:36:14.528 --> 00:36:22.475]  Now I want to talk about the whole Scaramucci controversy which arose last night out of this New Yorker magazine interview.
[00:36:23.075 --> 00:36:32.463]  Claims flying on both sides that it should have been off the record, of course the New Yorker writer says it was on the record, with Scaramucci throwing shade at Bannon.
[00:36:32.703 --> 00:36:34.444]  You've got this kind of three-way
[00:36:35.525 --> 00:36:46.670]  Well, at 2pm today I'm going to have an exclusive report for InfoWars, breaking this down in even greater detail, because in all honesty, Paul, the situation changes literally by the minute.
[00:37:05.236 --> 00:37:08.982]  But so our listeners can understand the battle lines.
[00:37:09.002 --> 00:37:11.487]  This is really a two-way fight.
[00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:41.077]  Steve Bannon, for reasons that don't really make sense to me, has aligned himself with Reince Priebus and the pragmatist wing of the Trump White House, the so-called Republican establishment loyalists, where Andrew Dice Scaramucci, as we now call him, really stands for undiluted Trumpism, the quaint notion that perhaps we should be appointing people to federal office who are Trump supporters rather than Bush supporters.
[00:37:42.353 --> 00:38:03.773]  Bannon, as you know, has, although putting some of the anti-globalist themes before the president, helping him in that regard, has aligned himself on personnel matters, largely with the Atlas Priebus, who is now known among many members of the White House staff by the nickname Rancid Penis.
[00:38:04.957 --> 00:38:14.443]  It is really breaking down to be a fight between the loyalists to Trump and the pragmatists who Bannon has sadly thrown in with.
[00:38:15.663 --> 00:38:19.926]  Meanwhile, I think Reince Priebus's position hangs by a thread.
[00:38:20.406 --> 00:38:24.368]  I don't expect him to survive much longer than a day or two.
[00:38:24.388 --> 00:38:29.271]  And the real question is, where will the president go in his selection?
[00:38:30.206 --> 00:38:31.166]  of an alternative.
[00:38:31.666 --> 00:38:36.428]  Will he elevate Scaramucci himself to the chief of staff position?
[00:38:36.928 --> 00:38:50.392]  Will he choose someone like David Urban, who ran the Pennsylvania campaign, a decorated war veteran and longtime Capitol Hill veteran known for his savvy and his fierce loyalty to Donald Trump?
[00:38:51.352 --> 00:39:09.143]  Or will he turn to General Jack Kelly, who would appear on paper to have the administrative skills for this position, but who has ties to the globalists and who is one of the major proponents of the re-ignition of the war on drugs by the police state.
[00:39:10.263 --> 00:39:13.545]  Is this situation literally changing by the moment?
[00:39:14.106 --> 00:39:16.367]  And then, sadly, I must tell you, there is the
[00:39:17.111 --> 00:39:21.593]  No, I mean, these situations are always fluid because
[00:39:40.138 --> 00:39:43.479]  As we've seen before, President Trump listens to advice from all corners.
[00:39:43.499 --> 00:39:47.600]  He can't possibly know everything, which is why these situations are subject to change.
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.600]  Where does Jeff Sessions stand in all this?
[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:55.861]  Because, of course, Breitbart has vociferously come out and defended him over the past few days.
[00:39:56.241 --> 00:39:59.722]  Trump has gone after Sessions to some extent on Twitter.
[00:40:00.142 --> 00:40:02.303]  Some of Trump's base say that's a mistake.
[00:40:02.423 --> 00:40:06.384]  Obviously, Trump's disenfranchised, disillusioned with Sessions to some extent.
[00:40:07.064 --> 00:40:08.184]  Where do you see this going?
[00:40:09.756 --> 00:40:13.540]  Well, the President, I think, is right to be disillusioned with Jeff Sessions.
[00:40:14.461 --> 00:40:28.699]  We know that the super-secret FISA court rendered essentially a decision at the very end of the Obama administration which certified, without any question, the mass surveillance of tens of thousands of Americans, including yours truly,
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:38.885]  For strictly political purposes, we weren't being surveilled because we were in touch with foreign powers or because we were engaged in subversive activities.
[00:40:38.965 --> 00:40:43.327]  We were being surveilled because we were for Donald Trump, because we are Republicans.
[00:40:44.868 --> 00:40:58.816]  And this is a crime ten times worse than Watergate, and it implicates not only Mr. Clapper, former CIA Director John O. Islamic Man Brennan,
[00:41:00.022 --> 00:41:08.087]  Admiral Rogers, Valerie Jarrett, Susan Rice, and yes, I think we have to assume Barack Obama himself.
[00:41:08.668 --> 00:41:11.430]  What did the President know, and when did he know it?
[00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:12.831]  This happened on his watch.
[00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:22.577]  It is unlikely that he did not know about the widespread, unconstitutional, illegal, willful spying on American citizens.
[00:41:23.357 --> 00:41:26.099]  Now, the question is, where is Jeff Sessions?
[00:41:26.779 --> 00:41:28.821]  Why has he done nothing about this?
[00:41:29.921 --> 00:41:43.951]  Attorneys I have spoken to, who are experts in the area, tell me this is a slam-dunk criminal indictment, that you could take the FISA court document to any grand jury and have an afternoon indictment of all of its culprits.
[00:41:45.372 --> 00:41:47.013]  Yet Sessions is missing in action.
[00:41:47.133 --> 00:41:47.834]  He's done nothing.
[00:41:48.594 --> 00:41:55.079]  Then you have the question of Bill and Hillary Clinton and their money scam of the Clinton Foundation.
[00:41:55.706 --> 00:41:56.567]  It's not a charity.
[00:41:56.827 --> 00:42:00.810]  It was a slush fund for Bill and Hillary and their greedy little daughter.
[00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:16.241]  And as you know, Paul, it was the vehicle for the facilitation of multi-million dollar bribes pertaining to the direct sale of government decisions, such as the transfer of control of much of the country's uranium to the Russians.
[00:42:17.142 --> 00:42:19.543]  There's the banking scandal, the gas scandal.
[00:42:20.044 --> 00:42:22.926]  Once again, Jeff Sessions missing in action.
[00:42:23.766 --> 00:42:27.449]  On the other hand, Sessions seems to be dedicated to arresting pot smokers.
[00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:51.529]  Anybody in the 29 states that have legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes are in grave danger because Jeff Sessions seems to think that that is a priority, notwithstanding the fact that candidate Trump said very clearly during the campaign that he favored states' rights on this question, although he himself does not support
[00:42:52.093 --> 00:42:56.456]  I don't think Breitbart has the kind of impact that they had back when Bannon was at the helm.
[00:42:56.496 --> 00:43:02.280]  Frankly, they have been supplanted by Infowars as the leading voice of liberty in the nation's capital.
[00:43:22.805 --> 00:43:27.412]  There does seem to be a struggle over editorial control taking place at Breitbart.
[00:43:27.432 --> 00:43:30.397]  They seem to be going off in several different directions at different times.
[00:43:30.937 --> 00:43:31.739]  With sessions
[00:43:32.617 --> 00:43:34.137]  He could have been influenced, as you said.
[00:43:34.177 --> 00:43:38.459]  Of course, you've got the Obama holdovers, the Never Trumpers working directly against Trump.
[00:43:38.939 --> 00:43:47.661]  Then you've got others, which probably fall into the category of, you know, deer in the headlights, where they're not really vehemently acting as bulldogs for the Trump agenda.
[00:43:47.681 --> 00:43:49.882]  They're not getting on the offensive, as they should be doing.
[00:43:50.142 --> 00:43:52.062]  That's what Scaramucci was brought in to do.
[00:43:52.362 --> 00:43:53.723]  He's going after the leakers.
[00:43:53.743 --> 00:43:54.863]  We have this headline.
[00:43:55.555 --> 00:44:03.401]  Up on Infowars.com, report top FBI lawyer James A. Baker under investigation for leaking classified info to media.
[00:44:04.021 --> 00:44:12.828]  FBI General Counsel James Baker, a Comey confidant, is allegedly under a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice for leaking classified information to the media.
[00:44:13.529 --> 00:44:21.154]  Roger, is it going to take someone to be put in prison for a very long time for these leaks to dry up under an overnight?
[00:44:21.235 --> 00:44:24.317]  Is that what it's going to take and is Scaramucci the man to get it done?
[00:44:26.507 --> 00:44:29.329]  I appreciate the sentiment of what Anthony is trying to do.
[00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:37.657]  However, the history, as you know Paula, of finding the leakers by any of our recent presidents has been unsuccessful.
[00:44:38.297 --> 00:44:42.161]  It's virtually impossible to find out who leaked much of this material.
[00:44:42.859 --> 00:44:52.164]  What then happens is those seeking the leakers begin utilizing surveillance and wiretapping, as it used to be known, to find them.
[00:44:52.344 --> 00:45:06.091]  Before long, we are as bad as they are, and civil liberties begin to be violated in a wholesale manner that still never ferrets out those quislings who are leaking the information.
[00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:17.919]  Far better, it seems to me, for Sessions to focus on the prosecution of those involved in the Obama surveillance, as well as the Clinton Foundation.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:24.324]  Nothing would destabilize the left more than throwing Barack Obama in prison where he belongs.
[00:45:24.905 --> 00:45:30.990]  Nothing would destabilize the left more than the federal marshals kicking in the doors at 5 a.m.
[00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:32.531]  to arrest Jarrett.
[00:45:33.303 --> 00:45:36.507]  Rodgers, Clapper, Brennan, et al.
[00:45:37.728 --> 00:45:46.818]  This is really the answer, in my view, to getting off of defense, getting on offense, and bringing the fight to the radical left.
[00:45:47.479 --> 00:45:49.501]  Now, in the meantime,
[00:45:50.508 --> 00:46:15.597]  I have learned, and I will expand upon this, that Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, who, on his own volition, appointed Robert Mueller a special prosecutor, a special counsel in this case, when no one was clamoring for a special counsel, and when, more importantly, there was no evidence of a crime to have a special counsel investigate.
[00:46:16.804 --> 00:46:24.230]  It seems that Robert Mueller's job is to find a crime where none exists as a pretext for the removal of Donald Trump.
[00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:28.473]  Where, you may ask, did Mr. Rosenstein come from?
[00:46:28.513 --> 00:46:31.775]  How did he get to the Trump Justice Department?
[00:46:32.316 --> 00:46:44.325]  Given his background as a Bush-Clinton operative, it can now be revealed that it was Reince Priebus, who is the advocate for the hiring of Mr. Rosenstein,
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:59.932]  On the recommendation of, I hope you're sitting down, Congressman Elijah Cummings from Baltimore, the black left-wing Democrat with an IQ of around 70, considered by many the single dumbest member of Congress.
[00:47:00.873 --> 00:47:04.796]  He doesn't seem to be sure where Russia is, never mind the United States.
[00:47:05.477 --> 00:47:11.902]  Now why, during the transition, would Priebus take a recommendation from Elijah Cummings
[00:47:12.897 --> 00:47:14.960]  It makes no sense whatsoever.
[00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:22.891]  Cummings is among the president's most virulent critics, yet that is Rosenstein's patron in this administration.
[00:47:23.471 --> 00:47:26.876]  Someone has to question what Mr. Priebus could have been thinking.
[00:47:29.184 --> 00:47:50.941]  So you're saying that the appointment of Mueller links directly back to Priebus, and that he potentially knew that by appointing Mueller, this special investigation would lead to the attempted impeachment of Donald Trump, and that the never-Trumpers, the traitors inside the administration, knew that from the very beginning, and that they were potentially behind it?
[00:47:52.802 --> 00:47:56.225]  Well, at a minimum, it's clear that the appointment of Rosenstein
[00:47:57.208 --> 00:47:59.849]  Tracks directly back to Reince Priebus.
[00:48:00.929 --> 00:48:05.131]  Now it's impossible, of course, for Priebus to know everything.
[00:48:05.231 --> 00:48:18.496]  Perhaps he didn't know that Rosenstein would take the opportunity of Jeff Sessions' recusal to appoint a special prosecutor whose only intent is to take Donald Trump down.
[00:48:18.996 --> 00:48:21.477]  If you look at the front page of USA Today,
[00:48:22.373 --> 00:48:36.721]  It reiterates that Mueller is now going to be looking at real estate transactions and developments of Donald Trump in the period prior to his being a candidate for public office, prior to his entering American politics.
[00:48:37.502 --> 00:48:39.983]  And the relevance of that would be what?
[00:48:40.644 --> 00:48:42.004]  That's not his charge.
[00:48:42.264 --> 00:48:44.786]  That's not the mandate that he's been given.
[00:48:45.572 --> 00:48:52.457]  I think it demonstrates that this is just an illegitimate effort to take the President down, no matter what.
[00:48:54.159 --> 00:48:57.181]  And that is the subject of an article today.
[00:48:57.201 --> 00:49:04.887]  Is Trump entering a kill box by Pat Buchanan, where he makes the argument that Trump has been backed into a corner, as he said.
[00:49:05.467 --> 00:49:07.809]  Mueller has gone way beyond the Russian collusion.
[00:49:07.849 --> 00:49:10.791]  He's not even basically interested in the Russian collusion at this point.
[00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:14.874]  He's talking about investigating any financial transaction involving Trump.
[00:49:15.255 --> 00:49:16.916]  He's gonna try and dig up something.
[00:49:16.936 --> 00:49:19.018]  They're gonna blow it all out of proportion.
[00:49:19.298 --> 00:49:21.880]  And that's the way... This is about bringing down Trump, Roger.
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:25.463]  This has nothing whatsoever anymore to do with Russian collusion, right?
[00:49:26.624 --> 00:49:27.224]  Absolutely.
[00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:28.866]  I think that nails it right on the head.
[00:49:29.286 --> 00:49:32.208]  The entire Russian collusion delusion has collapsed.
[00:49:32.829 --> 00:49:33.850]  They have nothing.
[00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:40.415]  The meeting of Donald Trump Jr., the avid follower of Infowars and a true patriot,
[00:49:41.272 --> 00:49:42.733]  Turns out to be a total setup.
[00:49:43.374 --> 00:49:48.457]  We now have photos of this woman, Russian lawyer, in John McCain's office.
[00:49:49.038 --> 00:49:52.781]  We have photos of her attending Clinton demonstrations.
[00:49:53.441 --> 00:50:00.847]  We now know that the FBI under Comey let her into the country where she had no visa so she could have this meeting.
[00:50:01.367 --> 00:50:02.708]  Can you say setup?
[00:50:03.048 --> 00:50:05.050]  Because that's what this smells like more and more.
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:13.495]  Now I want to get your take after the break, Roger, about Obamacare, the so-called Obamacare repeal we have.
[00:50:14.156 --> 00:50:20.280]  This headline out of CNS News, Trump, three Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down.
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:30.447]  In a 2am tweet Friday after the Senate failed to pass the so-called skinny health care bill, President Trump said, quote, three Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down.
[00:50:30.767 --> 00:50:34.409]  As I said from the beginning, let Obamacare implode, then deal.
[00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:35.450]  Watch.
[00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:38.232]  I'm going to get Roger Stone's take on that after the break.
[00:50:38.292 --> 00:50:39.633]  I'm also going to talk to him about
[00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:45.815]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, who says he was told of a plot to take out President Trump.
[00:50:46.296 --> 00:50:49.139]  Physically, gonna get Roger's take on that.
[00:50:49.439 --> 00:50:51.100]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:50:51.121 --> 00:50:52.422]  We'll be back after the break.
[00:50:52.962 --> 00:50:54.344]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:54.364 --> 00:50:55.305]  Don't go away.
[00:51:08.513 --> 00:51:15.951]  I hope the mainstream media feels powerful when you know this is all going on and you do everything you can to lie about what this show broadcasts, what we cover.
[00:51:16.814 --> 00:51:17.756]  The blood of those children.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:20.461]  All over the world held in captivity.
[00:51:20.801 --> 00:51:23.621]  UN caught kidnapping thousands out of Haiti alone.
[00:51:24.642 --> 00:51:26.022]  The blood is on your hands.
[00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:27.723]  Leo Zegami, let me ask you this question.
[00:51:28.303 --> 00:51:37.026]  Who is behind this global sudden wave of thousands of thousands of pedophiles per country being caught?
[00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:38.266]  10,000 plus arrests here.
[00:51:38.606 --> 00:51:45.048]  What is causing this massive move against pedophile rings that even MSM admits may bring down the Catholic Church?
[00:51:45.208 --> 00:51:52.773]  Well, it's happening, and it's happening clearly in front of the whole world with George Pell, but it's also an internal conflict.
[00:51:52.873 --> 00:52:12.064]  A few days before George Pell got booted out of the Vatican, we had basically the police breaking inside the palace of the Holy Office, the ex-Inquisition, now known as the Congregation for the Matters of Faith, basically the headquarters of the most holy office in the Vatican.
[00:52:12.284 --> 00:52:13.985]  The police broke in and found
[00:52:14.065 --> 00:52:14.405]  I think?
[00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:43.484]  Daniel Pell is responsible for many decades of secret plan devised by the Vatican to give the less possible money to the victims of pedophilia and manipulate them.
[00:52:43.684 --> 00:52:50.511]  And he was made a member of the C9 group, which is a group of nine cardinals.
[00:52:51.472 --> 00:52:59.579]  And three of these cardinals have been heavily criticized for having protected in the past pedophilia, including Cardinal Pell.
[00:52:59.939 --> 00:53:06.304]  So many people were actually astonished of seeing in February 2014 Cardinal Pell arriving in Rome.
[00:53:06.824 --> 00:53:13.906]  And he didn't really hide in front of the media or, you know, in front of the other people in the Vatican.
[00:53:13.946 --> 00:53:28.430]  He started immediately acting with a lavish lifestyle that, of course, brought a lot of criticism towards Pope Francis, who wants to be this very conservative pope who doesn't spend much money.
[00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:31.612]  and he's living in a modest surrounding.
[00:53:31.773 --> 00:53:40.859]  While instead, George Pell was spending money, was making all kinds of things happening that were putting really in bad light Pope Francis.
[00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:44.302]  But he was not taking care of any of this criticism.
[00:53:44.522 --> 00:53:49.646]  He put him there and he basically became, after the Secretary of State, the number three in the Vatican.
[00:53:49.706 --> 00:53:58.313]  So, this is the first time in history, Alex, that such a high-ranking officer, let's say, or minister of this Vatican
[00:53:58.654 --> 00:54:00.580]  He's put in front of a trial.
[00:54:18.678 --> 00:54:20.600]  We are live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:23.203]  This is the final segment with Roger Stone.
[00:54:23.283 --> 00:54:30.412]  Roger, I just wanted to get your quick take on Obamacare because we had the so-called skinny repeal attempt last night.
[00:54:30.432 --> 00:54:36.218]  A lot of people, of course, said it was completely pointless, but John McCain and others managed to sink it.
[00:54:36.258 --> 00:54:37.099]  What's your take on that?
[00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:44.013]  The American people, I think, have to be profoundly disappointed.
[00:54:44.493 --> 00:54:52.320]  And now what we're going to get is a classic pointing match where the President blames the Congress, and the Congress attempts to blame the President.
[00:54:53.557 --> 00:55:02.424]  I see an opportunity, politically, for the President to run against the Congress, as Harry Truman did in 1948, as the do-nothing Congress.
[00:55:03.525 --> 00:55:09.890]  It's not a lack of leadership on the part of the President, it's a lack of responsiveness by the Senate Republicans.
[00:55:10.751 --> 00:55:17.195]  Also, a classic example, the President has to begin punishing the establishment Republicans.
[00:55:17.736 --> 00:55:22.800]  We have a special election coming up in Alabama, where Mitch McConnell has the hammerlock
[00:55:23.544 --> 00:55:24.246]  I'm the president.
[00:55:24.526 --> 00:55:28.696]  I'm squeezing him for the endorsement of establishment candidate Luther Strange.
[00:55:29.788 --> 00:55:41.158]  The president should reject that and should make it clear that he will support challengers to sitting Republican senators who will not get on board for the Trump reform agenda.
[00:55:41.999 --> 00:55:46.103]  Franklin Roosevelt did this, and it's essential that President Trump do it.
[00:55:46.563 --> 00:55:48.865]  He is not a creature of the Republican Party.
[00:55:48.885 --> 00:55:51.127]  He is a creature of the American people.
[00:55:51.868 --> 00:55:56.532]  And if he makes it clear that he's prepared to visit Alaska and will campaign against Lisa Murkowski,
[00:55:57.327 --> 00:55:59.329]  That he's prepared to weigh in.
[00:56:01.431 --> 00:56:08.037]  There is no evidence that there's any lack of popularity of the president among grassroots Republican primary voters.
[00:56:08.758 --> 00:56:15.624]  I recently saw a poll in Alabama, again, where the president's approval rating among Republican primary voters was at 90%.
[00:56:16.265 --> 00:56:22.991]  He has more leverage at this point in the Republican Party than those in the congressional
[00:56:24.738 --> 00:56:29.101]  The wing of the party who have betrayed him on the question of health care.
[00:56:31.864 --> 00:56:33.205]  Okay, I know you've got to get off, Roger.
[00:56:33.225 --> 00:56:34.066]  We're going to leave it there.
[00:56:34.206 --> 00:56:37.348]  The website is StoneColdTruth.com.
[00:56:37.368 --> 00:56:38.589]  We'll speak to you again, Roger.
[00:56:38.629 --> 00:56:39.650]  Thanks for joining us today.
[00:56:40.591 --> 00:56:49.078]  I will be back at two with an exclusive update on the inter-White House conflict and the struggle for power inside the Trump administration.
[00:56:50.336 --> 00:56:54.899]  Okay, we'll be sure to look for that on InfoWars.com later today.
[00:56:55.099 --> 00:56:56.720]  There goes Roger Stone.
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:02.544]  Just before we hit the next break, I want to tell you about the great specials we have at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:58:08.163 --> 00:58:13.105]  Going back to what's happened in Hamburg, we have another terror attack in Europe.
[00:58:13.145 --> 00:58:14.746]  This is out of the London Evening Standard.
[00:58:15.026 --> 00:58:20.288]  Hamburg attack, man shouting Alar Akbar kills one person, now injures four.
[00:58:20.768 --> 00:58:24.529]  Because they said, oh, who knows what the motive could have been?
[00:58:24.609 --> 00:58:30.532]  Even though it was reported within minutes that he was shouting Alar Akbar, they're still saying, oh, who knows?
[00:58:31.312 --> 00:58:32.053]  Who knows?
[00:58:32.594 --> 00:58:35.437]  Not the religion of peace striking again, surely.
[00:58:36.098 --> 00:58:38.461]  Absolutely insane situation in Merkel Land.
[00:58:38.481 --> 00:58:41.345]  We'll get into that more with Tommy Robinson in the next hour.
[00:58:41.805 --> 00:58:43.728]  InfoWars.com, don't go away.
[00:58:43.768 --> 00:58:45.049]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:47.893]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:54.130 --> 00:59:02.901]  After speaking with his military staff, President Trump has banned transgenders from the military, citing disruptions in the service such as structural accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons.
[00:59:03.041 --> 00:59:09.129]  His decision stems from a long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide insurance for soldiers to transition from one gender to another.
[00:59:09.189 --> 00:59:15.551]  In other news, President Trump also publicly blasted his Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not replacing acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.
[00:59:15.591 --> 00:59:20.453]  It was at the center of controversy after his wife received $700,000 for her political campaign from Hillary Clinton.
[00:59:20.493 --> 00:59:23.013]  McCabe was handling the FBI investigation into Clinton.
[00:59:23.033 --> 00:59:27.815]  The President also blasted Sessions on Tuesday for taking, quote, a very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes.
[00:59:27.955 --> 00:59:34.217]  So far, Sessions has focused more on ramping up civil asset forfeiture and prosecuting marijuana users and investigating Hillary Clinton.
[00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:37.418]  CNN, however, has launched an investigation into media pioneer Matt Drudge.
[00:59:37.518 --> 00:59:48.421]  The founder of the Drudge Report has been spending a lot of time at the White House, which has forced establishment media to not only acknowledge his influence over Trump, but also his role as the progress meter of the Trump agenda and how the Drudge Report represents middle America.
[00:59:48.501 --> 00:59:51.661]  If Matt Drudge is concerned about the progress Trump is making, so should the president.
[00:59:51.681 --> 00:59:53.722]  This is Kit Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[00:59:56.317 --> 01:00:00.418]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:00:00.918 --> 01:00:02.258]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:18.462]  Coming to you from the former United States of America.
[01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:20.662]  From deep in the heart of Texas.
[01:00:21.023 --> 01:00:22.883]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.085 --> 01:00:34.206]  It is Paul Joseph Boston in for Alex Jones on this Friday edition of the show.
[01:00:34.266 --> 01:00:37.627]  We have another breaking news story talking about terrorism in Europe.
[01:00:38.607 --> 01:00:39.607]  Helsinki attack.
[01:00:39.787 --> 01:00:42.887]  One dead, several injured after man drives through crowd.
[01:00:43.267 --> 01:00:48.148]  That happened probably just a couple of hours ago or an hour ago in Helsinki, Finland.
[01:00:48.628 --> 01:00:52.829]  One person is dead, several are injured after a man drove through a crowd in Helsinki on Friday.
[01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:57.650]  They're reporting that the driver was arrested and that he was drunk.
[01:00:58.402 --> 01:01:11.845]  So we don't know whether this is an accident yet, whether it's an actual terror attack or what, but again, bloodshed on the streets of Europe as we saw earlier with Hamburg with a machete knife attack with a guy chanting Al-Akbar.
[01:01:11.885 --> 01:01:14.126]  Police say they still don't know the motive.
[01:01:14.786 --> 01:01:22.588]  It seems that lull, that period of calm after Ramadan ended, because of course we know that Islam has nothing to do with terrorism, right?
[01:01:23.108 --> 01:01:25.109]  There was a lull in attacks in Europe at least.
[01:01:25.169 --> 01:01:26.609]  It seems that that has now ended.
[01:01:27.279 --> 01:01:29.700]  This Helsinki situation remains fluid.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.980]  There's not much information about it.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.140]  I'll try and get more information.
[01:01:32.821 --> 01:01:38.002]  But we also had the attack in Hamburg earlier, so we will continue to track that.
[01:01:38.963 --> 01:01:56.868]  Now, at the top of the show, I was talking about the pastor, Rodney Howard Brown, who came out publicly and said that he was told of a plot to physically take out President Donald Trump that was brewing on Capitol Hill, a deep state coup to basically assassinate the president, which we've been warning about for months and months.
[01:01:57.904 --> 01:02:10.850]  We also have the left and the dominant culture normalising that in the minds of the public, that it's not only likely that there will be an assassination attempt against Donald Trump, but that it's legitimate.
[01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:13.651]  That's the serious nub of the issue.
[01:02:13.911 --> 01:02:16.413]  They're not just saying that it's possible, that it's likely.
[01:02:16.673 --> 01:02:19.394]  They're saying that when it happens, it will be legitimate.
[01:02:20.023 --> 01:02:24.325]  That's the impression they're leaving with all this assassination porn.
[01:02:24.645 --> 01:02:27.686]  Kathy Griffin holding up the severed head of Donald Trump.
[01:02:28.166 --> 01:02:33.448]  You know, the play in New York, whichever way you want to spin it, they had the same play about Obama.
[01:02:33.488 --> 01:02:34.229]  Yes, that's true.
[01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:40.411]  But given the current climate, where the president is obviously depicted as Trump, they're stabbing him to death.
[01:02:40.931 --> 01:02:42.692]  You have Twitter,
[01:02:43.749 --> 01:02:48.331]  On a daily basis at any point, awash with assassination threats against Donald Trump.
[01:02:48.551 --> 01:02:54.553]  You have violent attacks against Donald Trump supporters nationwide, which are ignored by the media.
[01:02:54.613 --> 01:02:56.873]  That is an actual real hate crime wave.
[01:02:57.473 --> 01:02:59.394]  And now you have this out of The Guardian.
[01:02:59.874 --> 01:03:04.016]  To kill the President does fact Trump fiction.
[01:03:04.476 --> 01:03:11.338]  And yet it's yet another fictional fantasy about President Donald Trump being assassinated
[01:03:12.242 --> 01:03:18.016]  And the moral quandary of knowing that assassination is about to happen and doing nothing to prevent it.
[01:03:18.316 --> 01:03:20.261]  That's the actual script of the book.
[01:03:20.825 --> 01:03:24.987]  So it's not just like a thriller where the president has an assassination attempt against him.
[01:03:25.247 --> 01:03:43.135]  It's about the moral dilemma of if this militant feminist character in the book, who is, by the way, an Obama holdover that remains within the administration in this plot, which is exactly the same as real life, whether she should prevent the assassination for the greater good.
[01:03:43.395 --> 01:03:46.877]  And of course, she doesn't prevent the assassination as far as this review goes.
[01:03:46.897 --> 01:03:48.938]  I haven't read the book, but that's what it suggests.
[01:03:49.602 --> 01:03:52.864]  That she allows it to happen, despite knowing it's going to go ahead.
[01:03:54.345 --> 01:04:09.055]  The article reads, since the Second World War, numerous professors of ethics or theology have fretted over the question of whether a seer or time traveller, knowing what Adolf Hitler would go on to do, could be justified in killing him as a preventative measure.
[01:04:09.475 --> 01:04:15.920]  So no, in the very first paragraph, they legitimise the assassination of Donald Trump
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:24.524]  By bringing up that moral quandary, would you go back in time and kill Hitler as a baby to prevent 6 million Jews dying?
[01:04:24.904 --> 01:04:40.531]  Literally in the first paragraph, they descend into Godwin's Law, they descend into literally Hitler, compare Donald Trump to Hitler, then they give you the plot that it's an assassination attempt, an Obama holdover, a militant feminist,
[01:04:41.664 --> 01:04:43.845]  Well, it doesn't matter if it's the Financial Times of London,
[01:05:09.551 --> 01:05:19.655]  Whether it's the Washington Post, whether it's the Economist magazine, or the Harvard magazine, they all say globalism is collapsing, people are turning against it.
[01:05:19.955 --> 01:05:29.979]  We're not turning against internationalism, or being a citizen of the world if you want to live all over the world, or working with other countries, or accepting other cultures if you choose to adopt them.
[01:05:30.879 --> 01:05:38.285]  We're not going to be ruled by carbon taxes that bureaucrats and Rothschilds and Rockefellers and Soroses make money from.
[01:05:38.345 --> 01:05:40.507]  It doesn't mean Brexit's perfect.
[01:05:40.527 --> 01:05:42.029]  It doesn't mean Trumpism is perfect.
[01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:47.353]  It means it's about taking the power back to the people, back to the states, back to the government.
[01:05:48.334 --> 01:05:48.755]  Good news.
[01:05:48.795 --> 01:05:52.238]  Businessman, author, researcher, very popular radio TV host.
[01:05:52.579 --> 01:05:54.261]  Really appreciate him joining us for the next 30 minutes.
[01:05:54.621 --> 01:05:55.903]  Freedomainradio.com.
[01:05:56.183 --> 01:05:58.285]  Stefan Molyneux on Twitter.
[01:05:58.405 --> 01:05:59.607]  Freedomainradio on YouTube.
[01:06:00.207 --> 01:06:01.108]  Hundreds of millions of views.
[01:06:01.609 --> 01:06:02.690]  Reaching tens of millions of people a week.
[01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:04.392]  Stefan Molyneux looking at that.
[01:06:04.432 --> 01:06:05.673]  I mean, I don't know how to state.
[01:06:06.414 --> 01:06:10.955]  The level of history we are at right now, I mean, I cannot overstate that to folks.
[01:06:11.055 --> 01:06:12.795]  We are at such an epic moment.
[01:06:13.256 --> 01:06:19.297]  It will never, ever in human history come down to as important a moment, Alex, and I really want to get this across to your listeners.
[01:06:19.957 --> 01:06:33.600]  If the state wins, if the globalists win, if the communists and the socialists win, capitalism has delivered unto them such monitoring and control and video technology that it is entirely possible we will never, ever be free.
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:35.522]  It comes down to this.
[01:06:35.782 --> 01:06:40.206]  We have the technology to communicate free and peaceful and voluntary ideas across the world.
[01:06:40.607 --> 01:06:44.711]  They have the technology to control everything we do, to monitor everything we do.
[01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:48.114]  They're talking about bringing in monitoring of the internet in the UK and so on.
[01:06:48.615 --> 01:06:51.157]  If we lose, we may never ever win again.
[01:06:51.197 --> 01:06:54.440]  There won't be some big cycle of history and your great-grandkids will be free.
[01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:55.621]  It comes down to now.
[01:06:55.882 --> 01:06:58.204]  They would use every tool in their arsenal.
[01:06:58.464 --> 01:07:12.152]  To win, and they're trying it, we must use every legal tool in our arsenal to fight back, take no prisoners, push forward every agenda, challenge every relationship, push forward, because it's now, literally, or never, I strongly believe.
[01:07:12.473 --> 01:07:24.480]  They're going to have a breakaway civilization, put us into total squalor, use it to control us, and then use the fruits of the human mind and open society that has given us almost godlike powers to shackle us!
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.341]  I mean, this is, this is...
[01:07:28.062 --> 01:07:29.203]  Unspeakably evil!
[01:07:29.243 --> 01:07:29.823]  What do we do?
[01:07:30.343 --> 01:07:30.923]  What do you do?
[01:07:31.203 --> 01:07:32.564]  You have to stop protesting.
[01:07:32.584 --> 01:07:33.904]  You have to start getting out there.
[01:07:33.944 --> 01:07:36.665]  You have to recognize that this is an emergency.
[01:07:36.705 --> 01:07:40.366]  There is no DEF CON level higher than what we are facing right now.
[01:07:40.407 --> 01:07:43.127]  You need to pull out all the stops, get all the information you can.
[01:07:43.468 --> 01:07:45.348]  You have a global communications network.
[01:07:45.388 --> 01:07:46.709]  You can tap into it anytime.
[01:07:46.769 --> 01:07:48.149]  You can challenge people in your life.
[01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:55.772]  It is down to this, because if we don't solve this peacefully, the kind of weapons that we have, if it turns to war, might end the entire planet.
[01:07:56.252 --> 01:07:56.492]  Wow.
[01:07:56.773 --> 01:07:57.814]  Stefan Molyneux, thank you.
[01:07:57.934 --> 01:08:00.957]  Always enlightening, but today was extremely powerful.
[01:08:00.997 --> 01:08:01.277]  Wow.
[01:08:06.623 --> 01:08:13.209]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:14.691]  The war was lost.
[01:08:23.098 --> 01:08:28.719]  We are back on the Alex Jones Show and returning we have our guest Tommy Robinson.
[01:08:28.759 --> 01:08:31.720]  He is of course author of Enemy of the State.
[01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:37.462]  He has a new book out I believe today which is rocketing up the charts on Amazon.
[01:08:37.482 --> 01:08:40.082]  We're going to get into that later in the interview.
[01:08:40.142 --> 01:08:41.243]  Tommy, welcome back.
[01:08:41.263 --> 01:08:45.464]  Here we have Tommy.
[01:08:45.504 --> 01:08:46.704]  I don't have any audio for Tommy.
[01:08:49.619 --> 01:08:52.442]  We'll try and get Tommy's audio back, we don't appear to have it at the moment.
[01:08:52.923 --> 01:08:54.064]  Let me know when we do.
[01:08:54.144 --> 01:08:56.506]  Let's go back to the news though, I was covering before the break.
[01:08:56.526 --> 01:08:57.908]  This was out in the London Guardian.
[01:08:58.488 --> 01:09:03.494]  To kill the President by Sam Bourne does fact Trump fiction.
[01:09:03.834 --> 01:09:07.578]  This is another Trump assassination fantasy.
[01:09:07.638 --> 01:09:12.183]  Remember we even had Ross Douthat out of the New York Times before the election.
[01:09:12.896 --> 01:09:20.458]  Tweet a movie where I think it was a congressional candidate was assassinated to prevent him taking office.
[01:09:20.798 --> 01:09:22.299]  He tweeted it as a joke.
[01:09:23.339 --> 01:09:30.821]  How many times have we seen New York Times writers, Financial Times writers tweet a joke about Trump's assassination.
[01:09:31.121 --> 01:09:32.341]  They're building up to this.
[01:09:32.381 --> 01:09:36.202]  They're now literally writing fantasy novels about him being assassinated.
[01:09:36.682 --> 01:09:38.403]  It's absolutely unconscionable.
[01:09:39.023 --> 01:09:53.267]  Given what's going on behind the scenes that we know, and we'll get more into that later in the show, but we do have Tommy Robinson on the line right now, author of Enemy of the State and author of a new book, which, as I said, is skyrocketing up the charts on Amazon.com today.
[01:09:53.507 --> 01:09:54.487]  Tommy, welcome back.
[01:09:55.347 --> 01:09:55.547]  Hello, Paul.
[01:09:55.587 --> 01:09:56.407]  Thanks for having me.
[01:09:57.568 --> 01:09:58.268]  Good to have you back.
[01:09:58.308 --> 01:10:06.350]  Now, before this unfortunate attack in Hamburg, Germany today, which we don't know the full details of, but it seems to be another Islamic terror attack,
[01:10:07.068 --> 01:10:09.751]  There was this kind of lull, at least in Europe.
[01:10:10.392 --> 01:10:15.858]  The terror attacks seemed to stop all of a sudden, at least for a period of three or four weeks.
[01:10:16.459 --> 01:10:20.784]  The terror attacks appeared to stop when Ramadan ended.
[01:10:21.705 --> 01:10:24.749]  Now, Tommy, surely there's no connection, given we know
[01:10:25.732 --> 01:10:29.319]  Islam is a religion of peace and that it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:10:29.639 --> 01:10:37.013]  So why did the terror attacks in Europe suddenly seem to stop when Ramadan ended, given that there's no connection?
[01:10:38.576 --> 01:10:39.636]  We see this every year.
[01:10:39.816 --> 01:10:41.097]  We see what's it called?
[01:10:41.397 --> 01:10:42.617]  The Ramadan Bombathon.
[01:10:44.518 --> 01:10:46.539]  Which you see the figures coming through daily.
[01:10:46.939 --> 01:10:47.819]  And they excel.
[01:10:48.119 --> 01:10:55.582]  We see most attacks, as instructed, during the holy or unholy or very violent month of Ramadan.
[01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:56.882]  But you're right, you're right.
[01:10:56.902 --> 01:10:58.643]  They have basically come to an end.
[01:10:58.663 --> 01:11:02.864]  But as I say in that, we have had five attacks in the last, I think, three weeks.
[01:11:02.904 --> 01:11:04.125]  We're all stopped.
[01:11:04.785 --> 01:11:07.148]  In the coming minutes, just before they were successful.
[01:11:07.588 --> 01:11:18.219]  So I don't think it's fruit one, but you are right, as far as we look at it, they've completely stopped in comparison to during Ramadan, which when we saw a wave of them, didn't we?
[01:11:18.299 --> 01:11:19.401]  Three in three months in the UK.
[01:11:20.851 --> 01:11:21.251]  Exactly.
[01:11:21.271 --> 01:11:23.032]  And as you said, I mean, it happens every year.
[01:11:23.152 --> 01:11:25.393]  Proving again that connection.
[01:11:25.533 --> 01:11:30.496]  Obviously, if there's a wave of them during Ramadan, there must be some kind of connection.
[01:11:30.556 --> 01:11:32.016]  Surely, there was a kind of lull.
[01:11:32.096 --> 01:11:34.517]  It seems to have ended today with what's happening in Hamburg.
[01:11:34.898 --> 01:11:36.919]  The BBC's barely reporting on it.
[01:11:36.979 --> 01:11:39.720]  Sky News wasn't even reporting on it last time I checked.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:51.324]  Another thing that they seem not so keen to be reporting on, Tommy, is we had a mob rampage in Liverpool recently, which was, you know, as plain a hate crime as you will ever see.
[01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.685]  Numerous people attacked in the street.
[01:11:54.345 --> 01:12:01.088]  We're all supposed to be really concerned about hate crimes in the aftermath of Brexit and in the aftermath of terrorist attacks.
[01:12:01.693 --> 01:12:04.178]  But Tommy, why is the BBC not reporting on this?
[01:12:04.498 --> 01:12:11.712]  What is it about this hate crime that seems to have prompted the left and so much of the mainstream media to ignore it?
[01:12:12.555 --> 01:12:14.757]  And let's have the details as well of this crime.
[01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:16.818]  The details are young Muslim men.
[01:12:17.278 --> 01:12:18.379]  They stopped a Muslim man.
[01:12:18.479 --> 01:12:19.580]  They said to him, what religion are you?
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:20.560]  And he said, Muslim.
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:22.101]  They said, say the Muslim words.
[01:12:22.702 --> 01:12:24.883]  And he said, there is no prophet but Muhammad.
[01:12:25.404 --> 01:12:26.244]  So they left him.
[01:12:26.524 --> 01:12:27.225]  They walked on.
[01:12:27.425 --> 01:12:28.346]  They stopped the next man.
[01:12:28.766 --> 01:12:29.526]  What religion are you?
[01:12:29.707 --> 01:12:30.347]  I'm Christian.
[01:12:30.547 --> 01:12:30.867]  Bang.
[01:12:31.208 --> 01:12:32.168]  They violently beat him.
[01:12:32.188 --> 01:12:33.409]  His girlfriend tried to stop them.
[01:12:33.609 --> 01:12:36.011]  These weren't just hate crimes where it was a group attacking a man.
[01:12:36.271 --> 01:12:38.753]  They're attacking men who were their partners with their girlfriends.
[01:12:39.333 --> 01:12:42.155]  One of the victims, this is where we see Stockholm Syndrome in Europe.
[01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:44.777]  One of the victims was a Labour councillor.
[01:12:45.438 --> 01:12:50.663]  Now that Labour councillor, he put out yesterday saying he's not happy with the way it's been reported.
[01:12:51.024 --> 01:12:55.809]  Because the headline read, Muslim mob attack non-Muslims for being white.
[01:12:57.498 --> 01:12:58.979]  Completely accurate headline.
[01:12:59.019 --> 01:12:59.860]  Completely accurate.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.403]  Completely accurate when you hear the details of what's happened.
[01:13:03.743 --> 01:13:06.105]  He wasn't happy with that headline.
[01:13:06.366 --> 01:13:07.627]  He was the man that's been beaten up.
[01:13:07.707 --> 01:13:08.768]  One of the men that's been beaten up.
[01:13:09.288 --> 01:13:12.070]  But these men went through the streets, attacking him, attacking, attacking.
[01:13:12.471 --> 01:13:16.995]  And thankfully, the first Muslim man that they stopped, he rang the police.
[01:13:17.015 --> 01:13:20.177]  Because in his mind, they were asking him, is he Muslim?
[01:13:20.197 --> 01:13:21.959]  Because if he wasn't, they were going to kill him.
[01:13:22.459 --> 01:13:23.480]  Which is what they went on to do.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.241]  They went on to attack.
[01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:25.642]  And the reason why this
[01:13:26.002 --> 01:13:26.583]  I think it's
[01:13:42.219 --> 01:13:48.362]  Shops that were being used for grooming in Liverpool, in Birkenhead, where they were raping the young girls.
[01:13:48.722 --> 01:13:50.182]  Now we see these sorts of attacks.
[01:13:50.522 --> 01:13:59.526]  Now, just imagine, which I say to people in Liverpool, Luton has a population that has 30 times more Muslims in percentage in the city than what Liverpool has.
[01:13:59.806 --> 01:14:00.887]  Look what's already happening.
[01:14:01.147 --> 01:14:01.987]  Look what's already happening.
[01:14:02.447 --> 01:14:05.148]  And you're right, this is a hate crime that no-one spoke about.
[01:14:05.168 --> 01:14:10.911]  The only hate crimes we hear about is a dirty look on a bus, or someone tweeting something offensive.
[01:14:11.511 --> 01:14:15.035]  Listen, and if that was the case, those sort of stories go completely viral.
[01:14:15.055 --> 01:14:17.178]  We all see them go viral whenever they happen.
[01:14:17.658 --> 01:14:23.545]  This, I think this has only been reported originally in the local newspaper, until people have picked up on it and it's gone out now.
[01:14:25.103 --> 01:14:41.507]  Well of course we had another what they call a hate crime back a few weeks ago, probably about six weeks ago after the Manchester attacks in Liverpool where it was a guy on a Facebook video threatening with words to slice Muslims ears off with a machete.
[01:14:41.847 --> 01:14:43.167]  Fair enough, that's a hate crime.
[01:14:43.427 --> 01:14:44.808]  It was reported by everyone.
[01:14:44.828 --> 01:14:46.488]  It was reported by the BBC.
[01:14:47.248 --> 01:14:48.649]  That's words, OK?
[01:14:48.909 --> 01:14:55.351]  This was an actual violent assault on several people directed against them because they're non-Muslims, because they're white.
[01:14:55.651 --> 01:15:00.852]  It's not even in the local BBC News section for Merseyside.
[01:15:01.152 --> 01:15:13.316]  I mean, this is a deli... It must be a deliberate decision to ignore this if the roles were reversed, if this was a bunch of white people, a bunch of far-right Christians or whoever, rampaging through the streets asking Muslims if they were
[01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:16.419]  Christian, if they said they were Muslims, attacking them viciously.
[01:15:16.799 --> 01:15:20.463]  That would be a national outrage as it is.
[01:15:20.823 --> 01:15:24.226]  The BBC hasn't even reported it in their local section.
[01:15:24.647 --> 01:15:27.349]  And these guys, Tommy, they're going to be in jail.
[01:15:27.369 --> 01:15:29.631]  They've got sentences for about 42 weeks.
[01:15:30.112 --> 01:15:32.434]  They're probably going to be out on the streets again within months.
[01:15:32.934 --> 01:15:35.597]  And no one will even have heard of this because they're not reporting on it.
[01:15:36.354 --> 01:15:39.115]  Well, they've gone to Jihad University as well.
[01:15:39.595 --> 01:15:41.275]  So that's where they are now.
[01:15:41.295 --> 01:15:41.995]  They're in prison.
[01:15:42.015 --> 01:15:45.256]  They're going to be getting radicalised further, more extreme.
[01:15:45.596 --> 01:15:56.998]  And actually, as you say, could you imagine, could anyone imagine the outcry if Muslim families, because it's what it is, families, men and women, were stopped walking home and asked, are you Muslim?
[01:15:57.218 --> 01:15:59.439]  And when they say yes, they're all violently beaten.
[01:15:59.459 --> 01:15:59.959]  Could you imagine?
[01:16:00.683 --> 01:16:01.123]  Imagine!
[01:16:01.143 --> 01:16:05.665]  It wouldn't just be national outrage, it would be international, it would be worldwide.
[01:16:06.025 --> 01:16:07.166]  Everyone would be talking about it.
[01:16:07.386 --> 01:16:18.491]  But again, if I draw another time, for example, what happened to myself recently at Ascot, where I was followed and I was harassed and in the end I was attacked and I defended myself.
[01:16:19.211 --> 01:16:21.392]  That story, if you look through the media,
[01:16:22.407 --> 01:16:45.281]  I mean, like, every single news outlet, even in Ireland, in Wales, in Scotland, from the top down, from the national newspapers to the local newspapers, to the Luton Gazette, to the Luton News, to the Buster Walter Gazette, to the Merseyside Gazette, every single newspaper run that headline with that 17 clips of footage, which just show me in the naked portrayal.
[01:16:45.802 --> 01:16:50.945]  Yet, go online, find any of the footage of Muslims instantly attacking me in unprovoked attacks.
[01:16:51.562 --> 01:16:52.483]  They're never shown anyway.
[01:16:52.843 --> 01:16:57.746]  So again, what we know, we know ourselves and your viewers know as well, there is a complete agenda.
[01:16:58.046 --> 01:17:01.948]  There's a complete agenda to hide the truth, to lie, and that's what we're seeing.
[01:17:03.698 --> 01:17:09.784]  And going back to what you talked about with the Stockholm Syndrome, the Labour councillor was viciously attacked while he was with his girlfriend.
[01:17:09.824 --> 01:17:15.770]  As he said, he came out later, decried the headline that accurately reported what happened.
[01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:23.838]  It reminds me of when a woman on a train, I think it was in Austria or Germany, back about a year ago, she was raped by migrants.
[01:17:24.258 --> 01:17:28.242]  She refused initially to even report it to the police because she said,
[01:17:28.862 --> 01:17:36.567]  Oh, they've had a difficult time getting here, therefore maybe me being raped was just, you know, part of their therapy.
[01:17:36.867 --> 01:17:42.110]  Maybe it's racist to report someone for raping you, you know, if they've got brown skin.
[01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:46.253]  That is the level of Stockholm Syndrome that we've got to right now.
[01:17:46.273 --> 01:17:51.256]  But I want to go on to talk about another story, Tommy, which came out yesterday, and this was in Birmingham.
[01:17:51.656 --> 01:17:54.438]  Sky News reports teenage rape victim raped again
[01:17:55.018 --> 01:17:56.980]  Raped again by driver she flagged down.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:03.285]  So she was raped initially, she flagged a driver down for help, and she was raped again for a second time.
[01:18:03.705 --> 01:18:07.088]  Both are described as Asian men in their early 20s.
[01:18:07.588 --> 01:18:12.573]  Tommy, should we be on the lookout for Japanese people, Chinese people, South Koreans?
[01:18:12.633 --> 01:18:15.014]  I mean, what on earth does Asian mean?
[01:18:15.415 --> 01:18:17.897]  Why do they keep using that politically correct term?
[01:18:18.715 --> 01:18:21.517]  Especially your viewers in America will be so confused by this.
[01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:24.399]  They will be so confused.
[01:18:24.739 --> 01:18:31.644]  Anyone from outside the UK, obviously, we've grown up knowing the Asian they refer to as Pakistani, as Bangladeshi, that's what they're referring to.
[01:18:32.224 --> 01:18:35.726]  But for anyone else thinking, you wouldn't realise that, you wouldn't know that.
[01:18:35.947 --> 01:18:37.428]  And again, that's done on purpose.
[01:18:37.948 --> 01:18:41.130]  That's done to demonise and broaden who it could be.
[01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:42.291]  We know who it is.
[01:18:42.871 --> 01:18:47.435]  I could put my life, I could put my house on the fact that both those men are Muslim men.
[01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:52.480]  Both of them, if they were described accurately, would be described as Pakistani Muslims.
[01:18:53.461 --> 01:18:53.901]  Accurately.
[01:18:54.622 --> 01:18:56.143]  They're still on the loose, Tommy.
[01:18:56.584 --> 01:19:03.250]  Not describing them accurately is helping them escape arrest after they've raped this poor 15-year-old girl.
[01:19:04.497 --> 01:19:14.312]  Anytime you read in the media, four attackers and they don't give a description, that means, I know what that means, as I'm reading Annie's story, half the time now they don't even give descriptions.
[01:19:14.433 --> 01:19:17.617]  Someone's been beaten up or someone's been robbed and the four men run away.
[01:19:18.405 --> 01:19:19.386]  Okay, what do they look like?
[01:19:19.906 --> 01:19:22.909]  Why are you not telling us what they look like?
[01:19:23.369 --> 01:19:25.651]  Why are you not giving us the descriptions of who they were?
[01:19:26.071 --> 01:19:27.713]  And that's exactly the same in this situation.
[01:19:28.153 --> 01:19:28.934]  This is Birmingham.
[01:19:29.314 --> 01:19:34.619]  And to people, when you read a story like that, I was talking about it yesterday, someone would think that, where did that happen?
[01:19:34.659 --> 01:19:35.099]  Baghdad?
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.221]  No, that happened in Birmingham.
[01:19:37.661 --> 01:19:38.862]  A young child was raped.
[01:19:39.162 --> 01:19:39.423]  It's like,
[01:19:43.072 --> 01:19:44.652]  Absolutely amazing, Tommy.
[01:19:44.672 --> 01:19:46.093]  We'll get back into it after the break.
[01:19:46.113 --> 01:19:49.313]  Yeah, she was raped twice within the space of, what, 30 minutes.
[01:19:49.393 --> 01:19:53.474]  After flagging someone down for help, she was raped by him as well.
[01:19:53.814 --> 01:19:56.595]  That's the situation we've got in the United Kingdom.
[01:19:57.095 --> 01:20:00.816]  They're all being protected through political correctness, as happened with Rotherham.
[01:20:00.836 --> 01:20:02.176]  We'll be back with Tommy Robinson.
[01:20:02.196 --> 01:20:02.776]  Don't go away.
[01:20:03.336 --> 01:20:03.657]  Hunter.
[01:20:05.797 --> 01:20:10.138]  Every article, every video, but especially these articles and videos, we've been breaking down.
[01:20:11.761 --> 01:20:18.348]  Dealing with the martial law, civil war, assassination, removal, sudden removal, coup of Trump.
[01:20:18.849 --> 01:20:20.731]  All of this is now confirmed.
[01:20:21.091 --> 01:20:23.954]  Talk about sensationally fantastic.
[01:20:25.336 --> 01:20:27.017]  Talk about living in incredible times.
[01:20:27.097 --> 01:20:30.321]  Talk about America and the world at the crossroads.
[01:20:30.361 --> 01:20:30.861]  This is it.
[01:20:31.842 --> 01:20:34.463]  And now, more than ever, we need your financial support.
[01:20:34.543 --> 01:20:36.504]  We have the very best products you need.
[01:20:36.924 --> 01:20:39.425]  Incredible air filtration systems that are $219.
[01:20:39.465 --> 01:20:39.825]  Similar units are $400, $600.
[01:20:39.905 --> 01:20:41.085]  Used to be like $800 a few years ago.
[01:20:41.105 --> 01:20:42.006]  The prices are going down.
[01:20:42.026 --> 01:20:42.506]  They're $149 right now.
[01:20:49.808 --> 01:20:50.710]  $149, normally $219.
[01:20:50.850 --> 01:20:53.193]  That is the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:20:53.313 --> 01:20:56.277]  The very same type systems, again, are $400 on average, upwards of $600.
[01:20:56.437 --> 01:20:59.661]  Pro Pure Travel are the very best gravity-fed systems out there.
[01:20:59.681 --> 01:20:59.781]  30% off, $132.
[01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:02.965]  The other competitors aren't even as good, and they sell them for $200, $230.
[01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:03.426]  That's $132 right now.
[01:21:07.811 --> 01:21:11.033]  Super Silver Special, the electric toothbrush that has silver impregnated in it.
[01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:11.893]  Amazing.
[01:21:12.073 --> 01:21:13.894]  And the Ployol Silver toothpaste.
[01:21:14.414 --> 01:21:16.035]  Super Blue and the Silver Bullet.
[01:21:16.115 --> 01:21:18.016]  Ployol Silver, 50% off.
[01:21:18.276 --> 01:21:19.377]  We've never done a special that big.
[01:21:19.717 --> 01:21:21.278]  Caveman Combo, 25% off.
[01:21:21.298 --> 01:21:21.878]  The Bone Broth.
[01:21:22.038 --> 01:21:24.259]  Super Female, 57% off.
[01:21:24.319 --> 01:21:24.960]  And why is that?
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.041]  Because we're basically sold out of the Super Male.
[01:21:27.141 --> 01:21:28.101]  I can't discount that.
[01:21:28.381 --> 01:21:31.163]  Super Female is very, very similar and works on men as well.
[01:21:31.203 --> 01:21:32.063]  But I want women.
[01:21:32.083 --> 01:21:33.524]  I've never really caught on with women for some reason.
[01:21:33.664 --> 01:21:34.124]  It should.
[01:21:34.244 --> 01:21:37.005]  It's even more dramatic than what I've seen in women, when it comes to libido at least.
[01:21:37.245 --> 01:21:39.265]  But stamina, energy, just read the reviews.
[01:21:39.465 --> 01:21:43.126]  Super female, 57% off, and so many other big specials.
[01:21:43.146 --> 01:21:44.346]  DNA 4, 20% off.
[01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:46.607]  Free shipping until the end of this month.
[01:21:46.847 --> 01:21:50.427]  That's only a few more days, and the huge sales of July are over.
[01:21:50.668 --> 01:21:57.009]  Please support the broadcast, support yourself, and help fund the InfoWar in the face of this oppressive assault, because we're having victory.
[01:21:57.109 --> 01:21:59.089]  InfoWarStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:21:59.109 --> 01:21:59.849]  Thanks for your support.
[01:22:04.318 --> 01:22:09.179]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:22:10.299 --> 01:22:27.443]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community, is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:22:28.223 --> 01:22:36.093]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:22:36.433 --> 01:22:45.644]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[01:22:46.425 --> 01:22:52.627]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[01:22:53.047 --> 01:23:06.792]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:23:07.552 --> 01:23:17.924]  Bottom line, when you purchase Caveman at InfoWarsTore.com, you're supporting the broadcast and true independent media that's fighting for the future of this country to be a free nation.
[01:23:18.304 --> 01:23:19.145]  So it's a win-win.
[01:23:19.406 --> 01:23:25.272]  But you really should try it for yourself to see what it's done for myself and so many others.
[01:23:26.053 --> 01:23:28.315]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[01:23:28.435 --> 01:23:29.716]  We're getting results.
[01:23:30.136 --> 01:23:37.021]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[01:23:37.362 --> 01:23:39.203]  Because of you praying for the broadcast.
[01:23:39.223 --> 01:23:43.106]  Because of you buying the products and financially supporting the transmissions.
[01:23:43.406 --> 01:23:48.210]  And because you spread the articles and the videos and the links and tell folks about our local affiliates.
[01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:50.592]  Caveman is back in stock.
[01:23:50.952 --> 01:23:52.273]  People absolutely love it.
[01:23:52.633 --> 01:23:58.378]  So please, secure your Caveman today at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:11.892]  Real live it is, the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:11.912 --> 01:24:19.659]  We're here with Tommy Robinson, author of Enemy of the State, but he also has a new book out, which I think came out today.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.242]  It's already skyrocketing up the charts on Amazon.
[01:24:35.535 --> 01:24:41.179]  Tommy, tell us about that new book because it's basically an explainer on the Qur'an as far as I can tell.
[01:24:41.219 --> 01:24:42.720]  Obviously I haven't got my hands on it yet.
[01:24:43.261 --> 01:24:44.582]  But what's the new book about?
[01:24:44.842 --> 01:24:46.403]  What motivated you to write it?
[01:24:47.204 --> 01:24:50.666]  So what the book is, the book is, it is the Qur'an in chronological order.
[01:24:50.906 --> 01:24:54.589]  That's a chronological order, not that I'm giving, Islamic scholars have given.
[01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:58.012]  So when you put it into chronological order, so it's like two books.
[01:24:58.072 --> 01:25:00.914]  It's a 10,000 word introduction which explains to us
[01:25:01.704 --> 01:25:02.404]  The Great Lie.
[01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:03.405]  How have we all been lied to?
[01:25:03.905 --> 01:25:12.308]  What you realise is, and what people feel so betrayed about, is that up until September 11th, the elitists, they told the truth about our history about Islam.
[01:25:12.428 --> 01:25:22.792]  If I quote you now, which I do in this book, if I quote you Winston Churchill, the Mohammedan religion increases the fury of intolerance propagated by the sword, the hopes of plunder and the joy of fighting.
[01:25:23.052 --> 01:25:26.053]  The religion of blood and war is face to face with that of peace.
[01:25:26.513 --> 01:25:28.054]  Luckily, the religion of peace
[01:25:28.334 --> 01:25:29.734]  is usually the better arms.
[01:25:30.095 --> 01:25:32.995]  Now in this case, amazingly, the reason of peace means Christianity.
[01:25:33.356 --> 01:25:34.876]  It's not the lie that we've now been given.
[01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:37.937]  That was by Winston Churchill, so he's a previous world leader.
[01:25:38.277 --> 01:25:49.100]  If I give you another statement now from an American Prime Minister, who said, the precept of the Quran is perpetual war against all who deny that Muhammad is the Prophet of God.
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:54.442]  The command to propagate the Muslim creed by the sword is always obligatory.
[01:25:54.882 --> 01:26:00.747]  When it can be made effective, the commands of the Prophet may be performed alike by fraud or by force.
[01:26:00.987 --> 01:26:04.330]  That was John Quincy Adams, sixth Prime Minister of the United States of America.
[01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:13.238]  Now what we do in this is we bring you through an introduction and we tell you how we've been lied to and when the lie started and everyone who's told the lie.
[01:26:13.358 --> 01:26:15.099]  We refer to it as the great lie.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:16.841]  Now when you get to the Quran,
[01:26:17.737 --> 01:26:25.622]  Due to abrogation, anyone who doesn't know about the ordinary Quran, when you pick up a Quran and you try to make sense of it, it's not in any chronological order.
[01:26:26.022 --> 01:26:35.008]  What Muhammad said one day could be next to what he said 20 years, which is what enables Muslims to give the out-of-context argument all the time, and this lie that Islam is a religion of peace.
[01:26:35.368 --> 01:26:46.495]  What this does, it puts it into chronological order, and because of abrogation, what Muhammad said later in his life, earlier in his life, is superseded by what he says later in his life.
[01:26:47.015 --> 01:26:52.358]  What this does, is now when you open the Qur'an, it's the first one ever where we've done it back to front.
[01:26:52.398 --> 01:26:58.180]  So when you open the start of the Qur'an here, the first thing you will read is the last thing Muhammad said.
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.141]  And it will be very clear to you.
[01:27:00.421 --> 01:27:07.304]  We've done it in bold writing, so as you get to all the words of violence and war are then in bold writing in the chronological Qur'an.
[01:27:07.724 --> 01:27:10.866]  Now, when you get to the peaceful verses, because anyone who knows Muhammad
[01:27:11.466 --> 01:27:13.708]  In his first 10 years of his life, he was quite peaceful, yeah?
[01:27:14.188 --> 01:27:16.830]  All the war, all the rape, all the jihad was introduced later.
[01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:23.834]  So when you get to the peaceful verses, which now are at the back of the Qur'an, it's actually their Qur'an, word for word, but the words are at the back.
[01:27:24.215 --> 01:27:32.060]  They'll have a little line through them when you get to the peaceful ones, and they'll just have afterwards cancelled by verse 2160.
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:35.822]  So they'll tell you which verses cancel them out due to abrogations.
[01:27:36.103 --> 01:27:40.946]  You'll then go to the verse to read what cancels it out, and you'll fully understand why when you read all the rape and the war.
[01:27:41.586 --> 01:27:47.714]  The idea is that non-Muslims like us, which is our biggest job, is getting people to understand this lie that we've been told.
[01:27:48.074 --> 01:27:56.585]  And when you see it and understand that throughout the whole of our history, our world leaders, our academics, our clergy, they all told the truth.
[01:27:57.085 --> 01:27:58.967]  They all told the truth about Islam.
[01:27:59.668 --> 01:28:08.555]  This new era, this lie that we've been perpetrated now, that's been pushed upon us, has all really come around from George Bush after September 11th telling us Islam is the origin of peace.
[01:28:08.915 --> 01:28:12.098]  And what we then do is we quote leader after leader after leader.
[01:28:12.418 --> 01:28:17.341]  And when you actually pick this up and by the end of reading it, I'd say to people, I can see them banning this.
[01:28:18.082 --> 01:28:19.103]  I can see them banning it.
[01:28:19.873 --> 01:28:21.553]  I can see them already starting a campaign.
[01:28:21.774 --> 01:28:24.014]  He's number three currently on the UK Amazon chart.
[01:28:24.754 --> 01:28:29.956]  I am desperate to have Tommy Robinson have the best-selling Quran in British history.
[01:28:30.116 --> 01:28:36.158]  So the biggest thing and the joy I get, and even people say you're going to get fatwa for that, they're going to kill you.
[01:28:36.338 --> 01:28:37.698]  You see if I'm killed for writing this book,
[01:28:38.138 --> 01:28:39.499]  The whole country's going to read this book.
[01:28:39.519 --> 01:28:45.301]  When the whole country reads this book, the whole country and across the world, they will understand what we're up against.
[01:28:45.321 --> 01:28:51.884]  They'll understand just how much we're being betrayed and the deception we've been put through to be fed the lies against Islam.
[01:28:52.224 --> 01:28:53.185]  And yeah, that's it.
[01:28:53.225 --> 01:28:54.085]  I'm excited about it.
[01:28:54.225 --> 01:28:59.808]  I'm excited every cell that goes through because I know it's another person whose eyes are going to be opened and they will be armed with the defence.
[01:29:00.188 --> 01:29:02.869]  If people are saying to you, Islam's religion of peace, read that.
[01:29:03.690 --> 01:29:05.190]  That puts it all in order.
[01:29:05.650 --> 01:29:06.631]  So yeah, I'm happy.
[01:29:07.706 --> 01:29:08.767]  I'm happy about it.
[01:29:26.677 --> 01:29:29.059]  By all the kill all the infidels passages.
[01:29:29.399 --> 01:29:31.120]  That kind of stuff comes later on.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.761]  That supersedes it, as you said.
[01:29:33.181 --> 01:29:39.085]  Most people will never even see that stuff because they're completely brainwashed and indoctrinated.
[01:29:39.325 --> 01:29:43.507]  Let's get Tommy's book to the top of the Amazon bestseller charts.
[01:29:43.627 --> 01:29:45.288]  Imagine how many people that will trigger.
[01:29:45.328 --> 01:29:46.889]  That will be absolutely glorious.
[01:29:47.169 --> 01:29:49.211]  We'll be back after the break with Tommy Robinson.
[01:29:49.571 --> 01:29:50.992]  InfoWars.com.

[01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:16.303]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.783 --> 01:33:20.507]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:33:25.945 --> 01:33:27.846]  We're back with Tommy Robinson.
[01:33:27.866 --> 01:33:28.847]  A bit of breaking news.
[01:33:29.247 --> 01:33:31.108]  Sad news but widely expected.
[01:33:31.408 --> 01:33:36.311]  British media are reporting that 11-month Charlie Gard focus of a legal health battle has died.
[01:33:36.331 --> 01:33:40.833]  The NHS and the EU death panels have claimed another victim.
[01:33:41.073 --> 01:33:45.096]  They wouldn't even let the parents take their baby home to die.
[01:33:45.176 --> 01:33:46.597]  That was their final wish.
[01:33:46.797 --> 01:33:48.958]  They couldn't even relent to let them have that.
[01:33:49.770 --> 01:33:52.392]  Now, Charlie Gard has officially died.
[01:33:52.432 --> 01:34:00.058]  Of course, I was involved in a similar situation a few years ago with some Romanian immigrant parents, hard-working, spoke good English.
[01:34:00.458 --> 01:34:04.021]  They had a baby in a similar situation, different illness.
[01:34:04.081 --> 01:34:05.642]  It was a type of blood cancer.
[01:34:05.923 --> 01:34:08.244]  They'd raised the funds to take it to a different hospital.
[01:34:08.445 --> 01:34:11.307]  They wouldn't let them take the baby out of the hospital.
[01:34:11.907 --> 01:34:20.569]  In some cases they wouldn't even let the parents sit alone with their own baby without being monitored constantly because they thought they would steal the baby.
[01:34:21.129 --> 01:34:24.770]  Absolutely horrendous treatment of parents going on in this hospital.
[01:34:25.150 --> 01:34:27.650]  Most of the cases won't even get press attention.
[01:34:28.210 --> 01:34:32.891]  Even this, they got global press attention from President Trump, from the Pope.
[01:34:33.191 --> 01:34:35.352]  They still won out in the end.
[01:34:35.412 --> 01:34:36.492]  The death panel won.
[01:34:37.139 --> 01:34:38.520]  Charlie Gard is dead.
[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:40.620]  Absolutely tragic story.
[01:34:41.061 --> 01:34:45.822]  Relentlessly shocking story comes to an end on this Friday night.
[01:34:46.623 --> 01:34:54.226]  Going back to Tommy Robinson though, Tommy, you tweeted the image of the perpetrator or one of the perpetrators in the rape of a teenage girl in Birmingham.
[01:34:54.486 --> 01:34:57.287]  Doesn't look very Japanese or South Korean to me.
[01:34:57.347 --> 01:34:58.127]  What do you think, Tommy?
[01:34:58.147 --> 01:34:59.888]  Doesn't look like Bruce Lee, does it?
[01:35:02.649 --> 01:35:05.732]  But again, they describe them as Asian.
[01:35:05.972 --> 01:35:10.637]  They don't give out any other identifying features that are going to help people find these individuals.
[01:35:10.697 --> 01:35:13.200]  Thankfully, we got the picture from CCTV now.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:16.263]  But again, it goes back to that politically correct Asian tag.
[01:35:16.683 --> 01:35:17.644]  Absolutely insane.
[01:35:17.964 --> 01:35:21.948]  Tommy, I want to read you a story which came out today, which is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:35:23.004 --> 01:35:24.585]  This is out of Information Liberation.
[01:35:24.945 --> 01:35:25.886]  Muslim leader!
[01:35:26.346 --> 01:35:29.188]  Australian women need us to fertilise them.
[01:35:29.528 --> 01:35:32.070]  White race will be extinct in 40 years.
[01:35:32.490 --> 01:35:50.122]  The Muslim president of the Halal Certification Authority in Australia reacted to news of allegedly falling sperm counts in white males with glee, saying the white race, this is a quote, the white race will be extinct in 40 years and Australian women need Muslims to fertilise them.
[01:35:50.658 --> 01:35:59.947]  Tommy, if you celebrated basically the ethnic cleansing of Muslims or Arabs, what do you think the reaction would be from the media?
[01:36:01.088 --> 01:36:06.052]  That's the insanity is this man has the full support of the Liberals.
[01:36:07.073 --> 01:36:15.360]  This man and his goals, even his goals, his goal of getting rid of white people is supported by many, many who are white.
[01:36:15.801 --> 01:36:16.682]  You couldn't make it up.
[01:36:17.162 --> 01:36:29.749]  I actually have friends who have been battling with this man's group in Australia, the Halal Certification, and they're doing now similar tactics where they're launching their solicitors and trying to sue and trying to silence people any way they can.
[01:36:30.089 --> 01:36:36.412]  If they can't do it through fear, through violence, then they'll do it through the legal route, whether it be the police doing it, or whatever Muslim organisations and rich people do it.
[01:36:36.852 --> 01:36:38.113]  But that sort of statement
[01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:41.615]  Again, this is the first I've heard of this.
[01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:43.076]  I haven't heard of this story today.
[01:36:43.096 --> 01:36:44.177]  I haven't read this story today.
[01:36:44.498 --> 01:36:48.321]  This should be, that should be major, major news in Australia.
[01:36:48.741 --> 01:36:54.066]  He should be, everyone should be coming down on that man for his views and for what he's propagating against us.
[01:36:54.206 --> 01:36:56.107]  But, of course, we know they won't.
[01:36:57.048 --> 01:36:57.569]  We know they won't.
[01:36:57.589 --> 01:37:03.914]  And it's just, it's thankful for channels like this and people like us to make people aware of what's happening.
[01:37:05.195 --> 01:37:06.536]  Let me read a bit more of it, Tommy.
[01:37:06.556 --> 01:37:07.277]  It gets even worse.
[01:37:07.808 --> 01:37:19.584]  This is Mr. L. Mouly who made the comment after Hebrew University in Jerusalem published research which showed sperm counts in men from Australia, New Zealand, North America and Europe had declined by more than 50% in less than 40 years.
[01:37:19.644 --> 01:37:23.389]  Of course we know white people basically aren't having children anymore.
[01:37:23.789 --> 01:37:28.350]  There's a lot of propaganda about the decline in population being a catastrophe.
[01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:34.971]  That's not necessarily the case, but that's a scientific fact that the white population is basically dying out in the Western world right now.
[01:37:35.412 --> 01:37:36.952]  This is what he went on to say, though.
[01:37:36.992 --> 01:37:37.672]  This is a quote.
[01:37:38.292 --> 01:37:40.133]  Your men are a dying breed.
[01:37:40.613 --> 01:37:51.515]  Australian women need us to fertilize them and keep them surrounded by Muslim babies, while beer-swilling, cigarette-smoking, drug-injecting can only dream of what Muslim men are capable of.
[01:37:52.265 --> 01:37:52.605]  Oh, really?
[01:37:52.785 --> 01:37:53.865]  What, acid attacks?
[01:37:54.125 --> 01:37:54.825]  Honour killings?
[01:37:54.906 --> 01:37:57.366]  Is that the enjoyment they've got to look forward to?
[01:37:57.906 --> 01:37:59.966]  Muslims have a duty to make your women happy.
[01:38:00.427 --> 01:38:07.048]  He went on to say, Australia's white race will be extinct in another 40 years if the country is left to bigots.
[01:38:07.308 --> 01:38:12.369]  The Muslim businessman called on these bigots to kill themselves or die.
[01:38:12.389 --> 01:38:19.470]  He actually not only said that white people would be ethnically cleansed, he wants white people to kill themselves.
[01:38:20.110 --> 01:38:24.233]  And that's, as you said, that is what the left has also endorsed.
[01:38:24.273 --> 01:38:38.821]  You had Stephanie von Berg, head of the Green Party in Germany, right at the time they were importing millions of Muslim migrants, get up in front of Parliament, say Germans will be a minority in their own cities within 20 years, and that's a good thing.
[01:38:39.121 --> 01:38:40.442]  She celebrated it.
[01:38:40.802 --> 01:38:44.985]  Now this Muslim president of the Halal Certification Authority
[01:38:45.385 --> 01:38:46.165]  Agrees with her.
[01:38:46.485 --> 01:38:50.387]  And that is the Alliance speaking the same rhetoric right there, Tommy.
[01:38:51.447 --> 01:38:52.948]  He'll be a well-respected Muslim.
[01:38:52.968 --> 01:38:54.848]  A representative of their community.
[01:38:55.488 --> 01:38:56.609]  He won't be a fringe voice.
[01:38:57.269 --> 01:39:00.370]  He'll be a well-respected Muslim in their community, saying all of these things.
[01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:01.910]  Saying all of these things.
[01:39:02.271 --> 01:39:05.852]  And you're right, you see, I saw the previous one you were talking about.
[01:39:06.112 --> 01:39:07.172]  I saw them all cheering.
[01:39:07.772 --> 01:39:09.593]  Yes, and we'll get rid of white people.
[01:39:09.953 --> 01:39:11.254]  And no Germans will be left.
[01:39:11.314 --> 01:39:12.274]  And they're all like, yes!
[01:39:15.012 --> 01:39:19.316]  It's already, in Frankfurt, it's already, Germans are already a minority in Frankfurt.
[01:39:19.776 --> 01:39:22.659]  You know, white English people are already a minority in London.
[01:39:23.139 --> 01:39:29.885]  Any other city in the world, imagine if ethnic Chinese people were a minority in Beijing.
[01:39:30.226 --> 01:39:34.009]  Imagine if ethnic Japanese people were a minority in Tokyo.
[01:39:34.389 --> 01:39:55.790]  That would not be normal, but it's only in the West that we're told that that's completely normal, to the point now, Tommy, where the BBC had an educational cartoon about a typical family, now this was their word, a typical family in Roman Britain 1,500 years ago, and they depicted this family as black.
[01:39:56.371 --> 01:39:58.372]  Now if that was true, fair enough.
[01:39:58.632 --> 01:39:59.272]  But it's not.
[01:39:59.332 --> 01:40:00.873]  It's total revisionism.
[01:40:01.253 --> 01:40:04.974]  A tiny, tiny amount of people in Rome and Britain were black.
[01:40:05.214 --> 01:40:07.575]  That is not a typical representation.
[01:40:07.875 --> 01:40:22.300]  The reason they're doing that, the reason they're depicting mixed-race communities in ancient times, again completely historically inaccurate, is to pretend, is to indoctrinate young people that mass uncontrolled immigration has always been
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.541]  A natural thing throughout history, it hasn't.
[01:40:25.641 --> 01:40:34.966]  If you look at the numbers of immigrants coming into Britain, it was very, very slow right up until the latter half of the 20th century.
[01:40:35.226 --> 01:40:49.613]  This historical revisionism to make everyone think that this is natural and normal, that it's normal for white English people to be a minority in their own capital city, is one of the most insidious things I've seen in recent times, Tommy.
[01:40:50.572 --> 01:40:52.173]  How quickly have they accelerated it?
[01:40:52.253 --> 01:40:56.575]  You know, you talk about white English people being a minority in their capital city.
[01:40:56.775 --> 01:40:59.957]  In my hometown, I've been brought up in that white English people are a minority.
[01:41:00.417 --> 01:41:10.242]  Now, what you have to look at to understand what's happening and how fast it is happening is the government projected growth forecast by 2030, which is what now, 13 years away?
[01:41:11.122 --> 01:41:14.884]  The Pakistani and Bangladeshi community of Luton will increase by 70% to 77%.
[01:41:15.224 --> 01:41:18.546]  The white community will stay the same by 1.3%.
[01:41:18.646 --> 01:41:18.766]  Now,
[01:41:21.078 --> 01:41:31.286]  When you look at how many people there are now, and it shows the decline that's going to happen, there's literally going to be no white people left in 15 years in my town of Luton.
[01:41:31.646 --> 01:41:41.214]  Now, how quickly that has happened, and the generation I feel sorry for, and the generation that are born into this, because you're right, they want them to believe this is normal, because to many of them, that's all they've known.
[01:41:41.734 --> 01:41:49.240]  Now, I can remember Luton, I can remember just 20 years ago, I can remember how bad it's got, but any people, any children born 10 years ago,
[01:41:49.901 --> 01:41:51.202]  Five years ago even.
[01:41:51.523 --> 01:41:52.324]  This is all they know.
[01:41:52.764 --> 01:41:53.826]  This is all they're going to have seen.
[01:41:53.986 --> 01:41:57.010]  They're only going to experience seeing majority Muslim towns and cities.
[01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:58.492]  And that this is the norm.
[01:41:58.752 --> 01:41:59.813]  And that this is the way it is.
[01:42:00.034 --> 01:42:01.776]  And you don't have all those freedoms.
[01:42:01.796 --> 01:42:02.897]  You don't have all that enjoyment.
[01:42:03.118 --> 01:42:03.939]  But that is life.
[01:42:04.319 --> 01:42:07.243]  And that's due to the acceleration of how quickly it's happened.
[01:42:08.096 --> 01:42:14.179]  But how it's being celebrated and really getting the British public to wake up, or the general European public to wake up.
[01:42:14.479 --> 01:42:15.360]  So this is happening.
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:21.463]  And if you don't think that this conflict can happen because we're Britain and we're better than that, it's the same Islam.
[01:42:21.823 --> 01:42:25.565]  It's the same Islam that's brought 45 countries to civil conflict.
[01:42:25.925 --> 01:42:30.167]  It's the same if you look even 20 years ago, if you look at Serbia, just 20 years ago.
[01:42:30.831 --> 01:42:31.853]  There was a war zone.
[01:42:31.873 --> 01:42:32.934]  There was a war.
[01:42:33.315 --> 01:42:37.121]  And I've just seen people are so naive to thinking that can't happen here.
[01:42:37.522 --> 01:42:38.463]  That will happen here.
[01:42:40.057 --> 01:42:43.279]  I quote a video I've done earlier of the previous French Prime Minister.
[01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:45.261]  Just recently he said, civil war is coming to Europe.
[01:42:45.861 --> 01:42:48.363]  Civil war is coming and we must brace ourselves for it.
[01:42:48.683 --> 01:42:50.745]  And when you say things like that, people are so shocked by it.
[01:42:50.765 --> 01:42:51.906]  But they shouldn't be.
[01:42:52.306 --> 01:42:56.849]  This era of peace that we have, this generation of peace that we have, it's unheard of.
[01:42:56.869 --> 01:43:00.712]  And what would it be any different for the next generation when we have imported
[01:43:01.232 --> 01:43:09.637]  A completely intolerant and violent extreme ideology into our country which is propagating subjugation against us, intolerance against us, war against us.
[01:43:10.778 --> 01:43:14.380]  I'm terrified for what the future brings and the demographical change.
[01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:15.600]  I mean, talk about those figures.
[01:43:16.081 --> 01:43:21.924]  It wouldn't be that alarming if it wasn't at the hands of an intolerant ideology.
[01:43:23.004 --> 01:43:24.545]  Were they excelling numbers?
[01:43:24.565 --> 01:43:25.706]  They're the only numbers that are excelling.
[01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:29.047]  The black community, the black non-Muslim community are not excelling in numbers.
[01:43:29.548 --> 01:43:30.728]  The Chinese community aren't.
[01:43:31.188 --> 01:43:32.189]  The Hindu community aren't.
[01:43:32.209 --> 01:43:33.229]  The Sikh community aren't.
[01:43:33.630 --> 01:43:34.410]  No one else is.
[01:43:34.890 --> 01:43:43.715]  This complete explosion in growth, which people have to ask why is it, why is it on average Muslims have eight babies on average in France, over five and a half on average in the UK.
[01:43:44.195 --> 01:43:46.036]  This is happening across the whole of Europe.
[01:43:46.616 --> 01:43:48.257]  And we should be afraid.
[01:43:50.649 --> 01:43:56.334]  And if it was a compatible culture, if it was Sikhs that were exploding in birthrate, it wouldn't be a problem.
[01:43:56.354 --> 01:43:58.515]  But it's the fact that this is not compatible.
[01:43:58.956 --> 01:44:01.077]  Again, we should be terrified of what's coming.
[01:44:01.318 --> 01:44:09.824]  But being terrified of what's coming, Tommy, doesn't mean, and I get this, you probably get this as well, that we're frightened of Muslims.
[01:44:09.864 --> 01:44:15.469]  This is one of the few things the left tries to throw at me, particularly, because they've got no argument.
[01:44:15.929 --> 01:44:17.670]  Oh, you're frightened of Muslims.
[01:44:17.730 --> 01:44:22.652]  So I say, OK, if I was frightened of Muslims, I wouldn't criticise Islam.
[01:44:22.872 --> 01:44:28.675]  If I was frightened of Muslims, I wouldn't continue to criticise Islam after receiving death threats.
[01:44:28.715 --> 01:44:30.836]  And of course, you've received many more death threats than me.
[01:44:30.876 --> 01:44:33.477]  You receive violent threats on Twitter on a daily basis.
[01:44:34.156 --> 01:44:40.019]  Tommy, if I was frightened of Muslims, I wouldn't live in South London, where there are lots of Muslims.
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:44.622]  I'd live somewhere like the Cotswolds, where it's 98% white.
[01:44:44.982 --> 01:44:50.705]  If I was frightened of Muslims, I'd pander to Muslims, and I'd make apologies for Islam.
[01:44:50.946 --> 01:44:55.048]  Tommy, if I was frightened of Muslims, I'd behave like the left.
[01:44:55.488 --> 01:44:57.729]  So they're the ones who are frightened of Muslims.
[01:44:57.850 --> 01:45:02.512]  Technically, they're the Islamophobes, because they're frightened of Muslims.
[01:45:02.832 --> 01:45:03.773]  They've submitted.
[01:45:04.904 --> 01:45:06.226]  I hear you saying it every time.
[01:45:06.726 --> 01:45:08.308]  Does it look like we're fighting?
[01:45:08.328 --> 01:45:10.591]  Does it look like we're fighting?
[01:45:10.631 --> 01:45:16.879]  You're literally out on the street every other week getting into physical confrontations with Muslims who come up to you.
[01:45:18.191 --> 01:45:19.652]  No, we're frightened of Muslims, OK.
[01:45:19.932 --> 01:45:22.893]  See, that's just the paucity of arguments they have left.
[01:45:22.973 --> 01:45:24.253]  That's what they resort to.
[01:45:24.713 --> 01:45:25.854]  Absolutely insane.
[01:45:25.874 --> 01:45:27.734]  I want to bring up something else, though.
[01:45:27.774 --> 01:45:29.215]  We touched on it earlier.
[01:45:29.555 --> 01:45:31.655]  The left aligning with Islam.
[01:45:31.896 --> 01:45:37.717]  The progressive, tolerant left aligning with the most regressive belief system the world has ever seen.
[01:45:38.117 --> 01:45:39.478]  You've got this guy on Twitter.
[01:45:40.418 --> 01:45:42.940]  I mean, he's probably blocked you years ago by now, he did me.
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:57.510]  Graham Linehan, who is a comedy writer, a massive, verified liberal on Twitter, who recently tweeted that the official Leave.eu Twitter account should be, in his own words, reported for hate speech.
[01:45:57.930 --> 01:46:05.075]  Their crime, that he said they should be reported for hate speech for, was to call the terrorist who beheaded Lee Rigby
[01:46:05.635 --> 01:46:07.196]  Quote, murdering scum.
[01:46:07.416 --> 01:46:14.680]  So they committed the crime of insulting a terrorist who beheaded a British soldier on the streets of London.
[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:18.842]  And this leftist rushed to the defence of the terrorist.
[01:46:19.362 --> 01:46:21.083]  Absolutely incredible, Tommy.
[01:46:21.343 --> 01:46:30.528]  And it brings it back to, you know, after every single terror attack in the UK, when the left get together with their vigils and their hashtags, they say, unite.
[01:46:31.048 --> 01:46:33.871]  They're not talking about uniting against terrorism, Tommy.
[01:46:34.052 --> 01:46:36.254]  They're talking about uniting against us.
[01:46:36.675 --> 01:46:42.461]  Uniting against the people who most vehemently denounce terrorism and dare to identify its root cause.
[01:46:42.742 --> 01:46:49.169]  They really have aligned, in some cases, with actual terrorists, if not Islamism, Tommy.
[01:46:50.265 --> 01:46:54.427]  When they talk about hatred, they'll say to you or they'll say to me, you do this out of hate.
[01:46:54.928 --> 01:46:56.729]  Do you really think we could carry on?
[01:46:56.749 --> 01:47:03.952]  Does anyone have that much hate that they can continue to go through this, continue to take the risk, continue to do it out of hate?
[01:47:04.513 --> 01:47:06.354]  It's just, it's insanity.
[01:47:06.614 --> 01:47:08.375]  When people say you're scared of Muslims, I think
[01:47:09.150 --> 01:47:13.114]  Look, I'm scared as a father of three beautiful young children.
[01:47:13.575 --> 01:47:15.957]  I'm scared watching the video of what happened in Manchester.
[01:47:16.298 --> 01:47:24.066]  I'm scared knowing that there's thousands upon thousands of those men who want to do those actions to us here, walking our streets every day.
[01:47:24.506 --> 01:47:25.507]  That's why I'm scared.
[01:47:25.567 --> 01:47:28.230]  And when they say you do it out of hate, I say I do it out of love.
[01:47:28.610 --> 01:47:29.371]  I love my kids.
[01:47:29.832 --> 01:47:30.713]  I love my country.
[01:47:30.973 --> 01:47:31.614]  I love my town.
[01:47:32.154 --> 01:47:32.614]  I love it.
[01:47:33.755 --> 01:47:38.578]  And it is painful and gut-wrenching to see what you are letting happen to it.
[01:47:38.818 --> 01:47:46.543]  And these liberals, like the people you're talking to, who jump to their defence every time, it's you who are responsible for the troubles we face.
[01:47:46.783 --> 01:47:52.246]  And you know when this does go au piton, when it does go bad, show who they're going to be running to.
[01:47:52.984 --> 01:48:01.416]  They could be running to us, running to the people they've criticised, running for the protection of them, running for the help of them, running looking for leadership.
[01:48:01.516 --> 01:48:07.265]  Because when it goes to an almighty bank, all these people, and I hope everyone remembers who they are,
[01:48:07.992 --> 01:48:10.915]  And again, that's why I wrote that, to list the people.
[01:48:11.336 --> 01:48:13.998]  This is who you are, that you will be remembered in history.
[01:48:14.198 --> 01:48:21.126]  This era that we've entered, which is an era where we've bred a generation of pure cowards, pure cowards.
[01:48:21.346 --> 01:48:29.014]  If you look, I know the Dunkirk film's out now, if you look and understand in history what previous British men done,
[01:48:29.634 --> 01:48:34.377]  What they went through and what they sacrificed to give a fighting chance, to give a future.
[01:48:34.637 --> 01:48:37.018]  And then you look at these Muppets that we've got now.
[01:48:37.619 --> 01:48:42.041]  You look at this absolute joke of a generation that I'm ashamed to be a part of.
[01:48:42.642 --> 01:48:45.563]  I'm ashamed that I'm born in this era of complete cowardice.
[01:48:46.024 --> 01:48:48.825]  Where we have British men have become such a laughing stock.
[01:48:49.105 --> 01:48:50.806]  You only have to look to Europe.
[01:48:50.886 --> 01:48:53.608]  I met two Polish gentlemen yesterday for an interview.
[01:48:54.008 --> 01:48:58.611]  And I look to their countries, I sit in envy at their manner, at the men they have.
[01:48:59.329 --> 01:49:00.790]  I see envy looking at Russia.
[01:49:00.810 --> 01:49:02.150]  I see envy looking at Hungary.
[01:49:02.431 --> 01:49:03.751]  I see envy looking at Poland.
[01:49:03.991 --> 01:49:05.052]  I look at Czech Republic.
[01:49:05.292 --> 01:49:06.493]  And I see real men.
[01:49:07.373 --> 01:49:13.816]  I see real men and I see the destruction that's been caused and the way they've targeted us and they've bred out.
[01:49:14.257 --> 01:49:17.038]  They've bred out and they fight in the men in England.
[01:49:17.578 --> 01:49:22.781]  And we now sit back and we scratch our heads and we wait to watch the next attack.
[01:49:23.101 --> 01:49:26.463]  Where our military are beheaded, or our children are blown to pieces.
[01:49:26.903 --> 01:49:35.267]  And the whole time while we do that, these liberals and these elitists who are in control of the media, who are in all their positions of power, they scream down at us.
[01:49:35.867 --> 01:49:37.148]  They scream and condemn us.
[01:49:37.608 --> 01:49:44.771]  It's absolutely insane, and I just pull my hair out daily a bit, as anyone can imagine, everyone sees, but I get so frustrated.
[01:49:45.251 --> 01:49:50.474]  So frustrated, and again, unfortunately Paul, in this era in history,
[01:49:51.349 --> 01:49:52.091]  Everyone will look.
[01:49:52.511 --> 01:50:01.889]  Whether it be eight years ago when people viewed me as an extremist, when I see people saying the same things against yourself, saying things against any people on our side, as the years go on...
[01:50:04.113 --> 01:50:04.293]  True.
[01:50:04.913 --> 01:50:07.974]  As the years go on, people will look back, they will learn and listen.
[01:50:08.355 --> 01:50:11.636]  And when things go wrong, they will look to the people who they can trust.
[01:50:11.676 --> 01:50:14.317]  And they will trust the people that told them truth in the time of hardship.
[01:50:14.837 --> 01:50:18.478]  The people who stood against everything else and said, this is what's happening.
[01:50:18.739 --> 01:50:19.519]  This is Islam.
[01:50:19.759 --> 01:50:20.699]  This is who's doing it.
[01:50:20.879 --> 01:50:22.120]  This is who's facilitating it.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:23.060]  And they'll look to us.
[01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:25.841]  So I sit comfortably in that.
[01:50:26.101 --> 01:50:27.562]  And I know yourself as well.
[01:50:27.682 --> 01:50:31.704]  And yeah, I sit comfortably that more people than ever are awake.
[01:50:31.724 --> 01:50:32.704]  More people are waking up.
[01:50:33.064 --> 01:50:42.366]  Well, what it will take to really give the Englishmen back their fight, and when that line awakes, I just... I'm crying for the day.
[01:50:42.406 --> 01:50:43.566]  I'm crying for the day.
[01:50:44.986 --> 01:50:46.106]  Absolutely amazing, Tommy.
[01:50:46.126 --> 01:50:50.647]  I mean, yeah, every time I look in the mirror, I know for a fact I'm standing on the right side of history, okay?
[01:50:50.767 --> 01:50:52.767]  You can't level that charge against me.
[01:50:53.047 --> 01:50:57.548]  We do this with vehement passion, and it's born solely out of love.
[01:50:57.608 --> 01:51:01.589]  We'll be back with Tommy Robinson on the Alex Jones Show, live after the break, in 4Wars.com.
[01:51:03.602 --> 01:51:11.771]  The news we're about to cover is some of the most powerful, important information I've ever covered.
[01:51:13.268 --> 01:51:31.785]  Elite publications like the Financial Times of London, the New Yorker Magazine, most importantly Atlantic Monthly, have all come out with articles that I'm going to be showing you on screen while our guest is on, saying we need to overthrow President Trump, we need to have new elections and our homeland security, and take all the Republicans that were elected in 2016 and remove them.
[01:51:32.086 --> 01:51:33.427]  They're calling for death, violence.
[01:51:34.108 --> 01:51:35.089]  This is insane.
[01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:38.352]  So I want to ask Colonel Schaefer, former head of the Bin Laden unit, patriot,
[01:51:39.432 --> 01:51:40.713]  With a lot of big connections.
[01:51:41.114 --> 01:51:42.655]  Helped expose Benghazi, you name it.
[01:51:42.875 --> 01:51:44.956]  Works for the London Center for Foreign Policy Research.
[01:51:45.356 --> 01:51:46.097]  Fox contributor.
[01:51:46.797 --> 01:51:49.359]  Where we are currently and how serious the situation is.
[01:51:49.419 --> 01:51:51.980]  Colonel Schaefer, you're more of an expert on this than even I am.
[01:51:52.481 --> 01:51:59.305]  I know that you've worked in some of the most classified areas there are and really had up a lot of things that I'll never see the light of day for this country.
[01:51:59.745 --> 01:52:01.767]  Am I overestimating how serious this is?
[01:52:02.447 --> 01:52:03.968]  No, Alex, thank you for having me on.
[01:52:03.988 --> 01:52:06.090]  And no, you're laying that completely correctly.
[01:52:06.130 --> 01:52:11.353]  You're essentially outlining the situation based on their own verbiage.
[01:52:11.833 --> 01:52:18.818]  And of course, then when they get caught in the open daylight, they then try to say, no, no, no, no, we never said that.
[01:52:18.858 --> 01:52:19.579]  It's all about you.
[01:52:20.159 --> 01:52:22.761]  The same way the deep state goes about saying the deep state doesn't exist.
[01:52:23.241 --> 01:52:24.603]  We're good to go.
[01:52:39.096 --> 01:52:39.276]  I don't
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:55.120]  Wow.
[01:53:25.143 --> 01:53:28.345]  They put out the message to billions of people.
[01:53:28.365 --> 01:53:29.546]  They know people are going to hack.
[01:53:30.006 --> 01:53:31.507]  It's like advertising.
[01:53:50.899 --> 01:53:54.621]  If you put advertising out to billions of people saying, come eat our hamburgers, they're gonna come.
[01:53:54.821 --> 01:54:01.625]  Well, if you put out advertising to billions saying, kill, kill Republicans, kill Trump, kill Alex Jones, kill, kill, kill, it's gonna happen.
[01:54:19.976 --> 01:54:23.360]  It is the Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:26.883]  Alex might be popping in later, actually, so stay tuned for that.
[01:54:26.943 --> 01:54:29.045]  We're going to go back to Tommy Robinson here in a moment.
[01:54:29.085 --> 01:54:34.411]  First, I want to tell you about the free shipping storewide at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:54:34.831 --> 01:54:37.213]  This is the fuel in our fire.
[01:54:37.554 --> 01:54:42.759]  You getting the products has enabled us to build this network over the course of the last, what is it, nearly 20 years now?
[01:54:44.418 --> 01:54:54.987]  Solely down to you, this is how we've been able to remain fiercely independent in a time of consolidating media, in a time of fake news media propaganda.
[01:54:55.347 --> 01:54:56.248]  We're not controlled.
[01:54:56.488 --> 01:54:59.751]  We don't get paid by Gulf state dictatorships like CNN.
[01:54:59.971 --> 01:55:03.955]  We don't get fat checks from George Soros like Media Matters or Black Lives Matter.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.707]  We don't get giant checks from pharmaceutical companies or massive corporations who tell us what we can and can't say.
[01:55:11.187 --> 01:55:12.629]  We're funded by you.
[01:55:12.909 --> 01:55:16.533]  That's why we can say whatever the hell we like.
[01:55:16.573 --> 01:55:18.555]  And that's what makes InfoWars great.
[01:55:18.616 --> 01:55:19.637]  We're truly independent.
[01:55:19.717 --> 01:55:21.299]  Please get the products.
[01:55:21.379 --> 01:55:24.542]  Free shipping storewide at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:55:24.843 --> 01:55:25.704]  We still have the
[01:55:26.404 --> 01:55:34.210]  Last week of July specials running, this is the last few days where you can get these massive discounts on all these products, including Silver Bullet 995.
[01:55:34.730 --> 01:55:36.512]  That is huge.
[01:55:36.532 --> 01:55:36.992]  66% off that.
[01:55:37.432 --> 01:55:43.237]  The Pro Pure Traveler, the Alexa Pure Breeze, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Knockout, Prostagard.
[01:55:43.757 --> 01:55:45.739]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:55:45.819 --> 01:55:48.040]  Mugs, high quality coffee mugs.
[01:55:48.421 --> 01:55:49.902]  Huge discounts on those as well.
[01:55:51.016 --> 01:55:56.439]  It is the last week of July specials, and it is available right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:55:56.799 --> 01:55:59.600]  Please support this network today.
[01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:00.681]  We need it more than ever.
[01:56:01.581 --> 01:56:03.462]  Going back to Tommy Robinson.
[01:56:03.522 --> 01:56:08.024]  Tommy, you've got an event coming up tomorrow in Sunderland, up in the north of England.
[01:56:08.944 --> 01:56:16.468]  An update on the shopkeeper who was harassed by police for the Don't Fund Terrorism sign that he put up outside his shop.
[01:56:16.988 --> 01:56:18.569]  What's happening in Sunderland tomorrow?
[01:56:19.491 --> 01:56:26.617]  Yeah, so we've got a website, slavefletchers.com, and what happened was a young man put a sign up saying don't fund terrorism.
[01:56:26.957 --> 01:56:29.079]  The police then harassed him and persecuted him.
[01:56:29.159 --> 01:56:32.061]  Visited his shop five days in one week.
[01:56:32.461 --> 01:56:34.143]  Now we all know how hard it is to get police officers.
[01:56:34.563 --> 01:56:35.744]  This comes from the councils.
[01:56:35.804 --> 01:56:38.066]  The council's campaign was to stop him as well.
[01:56:38.126 --> 01:56:38.827]  They got involved.
[01:56:39.307 --> 01:56:40.448]  They then threatened his mum.
[01:56:40.628 --> 01:56:43.010]  His mum was then threatened with taking away their alcohol licence.
[01:56:43.590 --> 01:56:43.911]  He then
[01:56:44.691 --> 01:56:47.655]  Because he was concerned for his livelihood, he took the sign down.
[01:56:47.675 --> 01:56:53.322]  We with Rebel Media then went away and got him a lawyer, got him a solicitor, sat him down.
[01:56:53.342 --> 01:56:56.886]  The solicitor told him they can't do this and he'll defend him if they come back to do it.
[01:56:57.527 --> 01:57:01.291]  We put the sign back up and put up a bigger and better sign, a big illuminated sign.
[01:57:01.371 --> 01:57:03.414]  Don't fund terrorism, shop at Fletcher's.
[01:57:04.477 --> 01:57:10.299]  Because of their attempt to silence him, their attempt to put pressure on his shop, tomorrow I'm spending the day working in his shop.
[01:57:10.319 --> 01:57:12.340]  And we've got lots of people coming to visit us.
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:13.700]  We're selling bumper stickers.
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:16.841]  The bumper stickers will read, Don't Fund Terrorism, shop at Fletcher's.
[01:57:17.281 --> 01:57:22.463]  And we're hoping now that cars across the whole of Sunderland, and across everywhere, will be showing these signs.
[01:57:22.963 --> 01:57:25.804]  And the reason, here the signs say, Don't Fund Terrorism, shop at Fletcher's.
[01:57:26.324 --> 01:57:28.645]  A Muslim business just 2.2 miles away from his shop,
[01:57:29.785 --> 01:57:30.666]  was funding ISIS.
[01:57:31.067 --> 01:57:34.330]  Up to £8 million, I believe, in the court case.
[01:57:34.831 --> 01:57:43.741]  So the police, you can't even have a sign saying don't fund terrorism without the police coming to stamp down and enforce their fear-mongering tactics upon you.
[01:57:44.202 --> 01:57:47.866]  So yeah, the lad who owns this shop has shown, I think, a lot of courage.
[01:57:48.146 --> 01:57:50.229]  He's put his reputation on the line, his business on the line.
[01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:52.930]  In the face of persecution.
[01:57:53.511 --> 01:57:55.312]  And because of that, I've just wanted to support him.
[01:57:55.692 --> 01:57:58.253]  So I'm going there tomorrow with others from Red Bull.
[01:57:58.573 --> 01:58:00.014]  We're doing this little campaign.
[01:58:00.034 --> 01:58:01.075]  We'll be working at his shop.
[01:58:02.215 --> 01:58:03.236]  Yeah, it's a happy story.
[01:58:03.256 --> 01:58:03.896]  It's a good story.
[01:58:04.096 --> 01:58:10.159]  So the only problem is that Celtic seem to be playing in the same city.
[01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:16.723]  And for some reason, Celtic fans think that I deserve death just as much as many Muslims think I deserve death.
[01:58:17.779 --> 01:58:19.360]  And I want to get into that after the break.
[01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:21.301]  We've got a minute and then we'll go to the next segment.
[01:58:21.601 --> 01:58:26.743]  But again, Wiltshire Police put out this tweet saying they're going to hunt down people who say mean things on Twitter.
[01:58:26.763 --> 01:58:28.424]  We've got record police shortages.
[01:58:28.664 --> 01:58:31.686]  We've got them literally begging retired police officers to come back.
[01:58:31.926 --> 01:58:32.986]  They're totally stretched.
[01:58:33.327 --> 01:58:38.229]  Oh, and they've got time to investigate a guy with a sign outside his shop saying, don't fund terrorism.
[01:58:38.289 --> 01:58:39.249]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:58:39.550 --> 01:58:41.010]  We'll be back with Tommy Robinson.
[01:58:41.050 --> 01:58:41.651]  Don't go away.
[01:58:41.671 --> 01:58:46.433]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:48.035 --> 01:58:50.376]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:54.098 --> 01:58:57.640]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:58:58.081 --> 01:59:04.144]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:59:04.544 --> 01:59:07.326]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:07.706 --> 01:59:10.727]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:59:10.928 --> 01:59:14.369]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:15.150]  The left
[01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:16.431]  ...controls culture.
[01:59:16.471 --> 01:59:17.452]  They control arts.
[01:59:17.512 --> 01:59:18.753]  They control entertainment.
[01:59:19.033 --> 01:59:26.140]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:28.582]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:59:29.083 --> 01:59:32.947]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:59:32.987 --> 01:59:35.048]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate...
[01:59:35.689 --> 01:59:41.051]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[01:59:41.311 --> 01:59:47.554]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:59:47.634 --> 01:59:49.335]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:59:49.475 --> 01:59:50.655]  It's available right now.
[01:59:50.975 --> 01:59:53.536]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:56.177 --> 02:00:02.100]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.834 --> 02:00:17.254]  Brother.
[02:00:17.675 --> 02:00:18.896]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:19.437 --> 02:00:21.339]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:21.379 --> 02:00:22.780]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:24.262]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:24.722 --> 02:00:29.227]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.061 --> 02:00:38.104]  Paul Joseph Watson in for Alex Jones.
[02:00:38.144 --> 02:00:40.507]  We're here with Tommy Robinson for the final segment.
[02:00:40.547 --> 02:00:49.456]  We were talking before the break about the guy who was harassed up in Sunderland, which is a town in northern England, for putting up a sign above his shop saying, don't fund terrorism.
[02:00:49.916 --> 02:00:52.499]  God forbid anyone should express that sentiment.
[02:00:52.879 --> 02:00:55.662]  As Tommy said, a shop two miles down the road was literally
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:57.623]  In bed with ISIS!
[02:00:57.683 --> 02:00:59.686]  They didn't get harassed, they didn't get abused.
[02:01:00.127 --> 02:01:03.413]  We've also got police all over Twitter and we had another case of this recently.
[02:01:03.934 --> 02:01:05.938]  Police departments in England, in Britain.
[02:01:06.437 --> 02:01:13.940]  Threatening people with home visits, literally threatening to track down, to hunt down people who send mean tweets.
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:15.400]  They've got time for that.
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:22.543]  All day long, despite the fact that police numbers are at record lows right now, they're begging for police to come out of retirement.
[02:01:22.803 --> 02:01:25.123]  They've got time to harass people for tweets.
[02:01:25.504 --> 02:01:29.425]  They've got time to harass people for having signs outside their shop.
[02:01:30.268 --> 02:01:31.369]  Above their shop window.
[02:01:31.930 --> 02:01:33.311]  And yet we've got acid attacks.
[02:01:33.331 --> 02:01:34.753]  We've got stabbings all over the place.
[02:01:34.773 --> 02:01:37.616]  We've got violent crime at a 10-year high in this country.
[02:01:37.756 --> 02:01:39.238]  Absolutely incredible, Tommy.
[02:01:39.718 --> 02:01:41.720]  And you're going there to support this guy again.
[02:01:41.740 --> 02:01:45.384]  Now you're getting harassed by fans of Celtic Football Club.
[02:01:45.704 --> 02:01:47.326]  Just tell us again what was happening there.
[02:01:47.747 --> 02:01:49.729]  And then give people the links where they can get the book.
[02:01:51.275 --> 02:01:53.456]  People don't know what the history was Celtic.
[02:01:53.536 --> 02:01:55.558]  I've got many friends who support CELWG.
[02:01:55.978 --> 02:02:00.720]  The CELWG Football Club share a solidarity and alliance with Palestine.
[02:02:01.321 --> 02:02:03.902]  They always fly the Palestinian flag.
[02:02:04.082 --> 02:02:05.743]  Many of their supporters hate Britain.
[02:02:06.123 --> 02:02:06.924]  They hate the Queen.
[02:02:06.944 --> 02:02:08.005]  They burn the poppy.
[02:02:08.385 --> 02:02:09.525]  They support the IRA.
[02:02:10.826 --> 02:02:17.652]  So, because I have my stance, and I'm not against Catholics, I don't hate the Irish, I don't really like Selwyk at all.
[02:02:18.273 --> 02:02:24.378]  So, because of that, they're all saying that Selwyk are playing Sunderland in the same city.
[02:02:24.418 --> 02:02:25.880]  There's 8,000 Selwyk fans.
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:28.022]  And apparently, as I hear all the time,
[02:02:28.682 --> 02:02:29.883]  They're going to get me.
[02:02:29.903 --> 02:02:31.723]  So, um, again, I'm not bothered at all.
[02:02:31.743 --> 02:02:33.424]  I'm actually going to the sewage suddenly.
[02:02:33.444 --> 02:02:40.327]  You've never seen that on Twitter before, have you, Tommy, where people threaten to physically attack you and then do absolutely nothing about it.
[02:02:40.347 --> 02:02:45.450]  The thing is, when you're talking about... I wouldn't mind it, because I'm not bothered by those sort of tweets, but with the police.
[02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:47.630]  And the police say they're going to track people down.
[02:02:47.891 --> 02:02:51.792]  Some of these messages I've received today, they're going to cut me up, fine me, chop me up, murder me.
[02:02:52.673 --> 02:02:55.894]  Like, they're the crimes that police... They won't even get banned by Twitter.
[02:02:55.914 --> 02:02:57.735]  Even Twitter won't even do anything about it.
[02:02:58.436 --> 02:02:58.896]  No, they won't.
[02:02:58.936 --> 02:03:00.837]  And I'm not saying the police shouldn't bother them with that.
[02:03:01.078 --> 02:03:07.201]  But the point is, if you're going to track down Englishmen for saying stupid little comments, then you need to do it both ways.
[02:03:07.221 --> 02:03:09.382]  The rule of law has to be implemented equally across all of us.
[02:03:09.663 --> 02:03:10.283]  Well, not all.
[02:03:10.883 --> 02:03:11.704]  So yeah, it's frustrating.
[02:03:11.724 --> 02:03:12.664]  I get frustrated by it all.
[02:03:12.684 --> 02:03:14.065]  But I'll be in Sunderland.
[02:03:14.105 --> 02:03:18.748]  Hopefully, I won't get too beaten up by any Celtic fans with their potatoes.
[02:03:18.808 --> 02:03:19.808]  But we'll see.
[02:03:20.769 --> 02:03:21.389]  All right, Tommy.
[02:03:21.409 --> 02:03:22.390]  We've got about a minute left.
[02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:25.972]  Just tell people where they can find you on Twitter and where they can get the new book.
[02:03:26.678 --> 02:03:27.499]  You can find it on Twitter.
[02:03:27.519 --> 02:03:30.682]  The new book is only, as usual, no publishers have published it.
[02:03:31.042 --> 02:03:32.763]  It's simply on Amazon.
[02:03:33.044 --> 02:03:37.227]  So go on Amazon, search Mohammed's Quran, Why Muslims Kill for Islam.
[02:03:37.808 --> 02:03:39.329]  And yeah, it's on Amazon.
[02:03:39.349 --> 02:03:40.310]  The Kindle will be out on the 31st.
[02:03:41.957 --> 02:03:45.159]  Other than that, our campaign for Fletcher is called SaveFletcher.com.
[02:03:45.499 --> 02:03:46.780]  We've got many campaigns running.
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:49.242]  We've got another one called Thank Knox, which we'll be updating soon.
[02:03:49.562 --> 02:03:51.383]  This is where we're trying to get the lad the wheelchair.
[02:03:51.783 --> 02:03:54.685]  We're trying to get him, and you can go on.
[02:03:54.765 --> 02:03:58.667]  He served 14 years in the military, and like most other people in this country, he's been abandoned.
[02:03:59.028 --> 02:04:02.690]  He's been abandoned while some money is spent on, I don't know, Somalians or Pakistanis.
[02:04:03.130 --> 02:04:05.272]  So this is a campaign where we want to help people.
[02:04:05.312 --> 02:04:06.733]  We're going to be doing one a month through Rebel.
[02:04:06.753 --> 02:04:09.235]  We're going to be helping them to get them what they need.
[02:04:09.255 --> 02:04:10.456]  This lad needs a wheelchair.
[02:04:10.756 --> 02:04:11.537]  We're nearly there.
[02:04:11.557 --> 02:04:12.998]  We've put a 30% deposit down.
[02:04:13.919 --> 02:04:15.701]  The wheelchair he needed was £13,000.
[02:04:16.481 --> 02:04:23.467]  I met the company last week and the one we're getting him is £18,000 because we're getting him the top of the range with everything because that's what he deserves.
[02:04:24.067 --> 02:04:24.988]  So there's loads of campaigns.
[02:04:25.028 --> 02:04:31.754]  You can follow me on Twitter, Tommy Robinson New Era or T. Robinson New Era or on Facebook and see what we're up to.
[02:04:33.314 --> 02:04:35.335]  All right, and I'll be sure to support that cause as well.
[02:04:35.735 --> 02:04:37.195]  Tommy, great to have you back.
[02:04:37.235 --> 02:04:38.256]  Hope to have you on again soon.
[02:04:38.296 --> 02:04:39.236]  Thanks for joining us today.
[02:04:39.656 --> 02:04:40.116]  Very much.
[02:04:40.176 --> 02:04:40.456]  Cheers, man.
[02:04:40.476 --> 02:04:41.477]  See you later.
[02:04:41.817 --> 02:04:42.157]  All right.
[02:04:42.337 --> 02:04:44.457]  There goes Tommy Robinson.
[02:04:44.597 --> 02:04:45.778]  Get his new book.
[02:04:46.238 --> 02:04:49.399]  Get it to the top of the Amazon UK bestseller list.
[02:04:49.959 --> 02:04:52.040]  That will annoy the left like nothing else.
[02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:54.220]  Absolute triggering.
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:55.741]  That will be delicious.
[02:04:56.624 --> 02:04:58.585]  To observe and enjoy Tommy Robinson.
[02:04:59.145 --> 02:05:00.966]  You can find him on Twitter at Tommy Robinson.
[02:05:00.986 --> 02:05:01.647]  Just search for it.
[02:05:01.687 --> 02:05:03.148]  We will be back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:03.528 --> 02:05:09.351]  In ancient times, man roamed the earth in a constant state of hunting or being hunted.
[02:05:09.511 --> 02:05:14.674]  Introducing Caveman, where cutting-edge science meets ancient super nutrients.
[02:05:14.914 --> 02:05:17.936]  Secure your bottle right now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:35.732 --> 02:05:40.116]  Every article, every video, but especially these articles and videos we've been breaking down.
[02:05:41.718 --> 02:05:48.304]  Dealing with the martial law, civil war, assassination, removal, sudden removal, coup of Trump.
[02:05:48.784 --> 02:05:50.666]  All of this is now confirmed.
[02:05:51.027 --> 02:05:53.849]  Talk about sensationally fantastic.
[02:05:55.259 --> 02:05:56.941]  Talk about living in incredible times.
[02:05:57.021 --> 02:06:00.263]  Talk about America and the world at the crossroads.
[02:06:00.303 --> 02:06:00.824]  This is it.
[02:06:01.785 --> 02:06:04.407]  And now, more than ever, we need your financial support.
[02:06:04.487 --> 02:06:06.449]  We have the very best products you need.
[02:06:06.869 --> 02:06:09.371]  Incredible air filtration systems that are $219.
[02:06:09.411 --> 02:06:09.792]  Similar units are $400, $600.
[02:06:09.852 --> 02:06:11.133]  Used to be like $800 a few years ago.
[02:06:11.173 --> 02:06:11.974]  The prices are going down.
[02:06:11.994 --> 02:06:12.454]  They're $149 right now.
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:21.081]  $149, normally $219.
[02:06:21.681 --> 02:06:23.142]  That is the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:06:23.262 --> 02:06:26.224]  The very same type systems, again, are $400 on average, upwards of $600.
[02:06:26.504 --> 02:06:29.626]  Pro Pure Travel are the very best gravity-fed systems out there.
[02:06:29.646 --> 02:06:30.967]  30% off, $132.
[02:06:31.507 --> 02:06:34.729]  The other competitors aren't even as good, and they sell them for $200, $230.
[02:06:34.789 --> 02:06:35.190]  That's $132 right now.
[02:06:37.771 --> 02:06:41.834]  Super Silver Special, the electric toothbrush that has silver impregnated in it, amazing.
[02:06:42.014 --> 02:06:44.856]  And the Ployol Silver toothpaste, super blue.
[02:06:45.036 --> 02:06:47.958]  And the Silver Bullet Ployol Silver, 50% off.
[02:06:48.218 --> 02:06:49.299]  We've never done a special that big.
[02:06:49.659 --> 02:06:51.240]  Caveman Combo, 25% off.
[02:06:51.260 --> 02:06:54.202]  The Bone Broth, Super Female, 57% off.
[02:06:54.262 --> 02:06:54.903]  And why is that?
[02:06:54.983 --> 02:06:56.984]  Because we're basically sold out of the Super Male.
[02:06:57.084 --> 02:06:58.045]  I can't discount that.
[02:06:58.325 --> 02:07:01.107]  Super Female is very, very similar and works on men as well.
[02:07:01.147 --> 02:07:02.008]  But I want women.
[02:07:02.028 --> 02:07:03.589]  It's never really caught on with women for some reason.
[02:07:03.729 --> 02:07:04.049]  We should.
[02:07:04.189 --> 02:07:06.931]  It's even more dramatic than what I've seen in women, when it comes to libido at least.
[02:07:07.191 --> 02:07:09.212]  But stamina, energy, just read the reviews.
[02:07:09.412 --> 02:07:13.074]  Super female, 57% off, and so many other big specials.
[02:07:13.094 --> 02:07:14.294]  DNA 4, 20% off.
[02:07:14.615 --> 02:07:16.556]  Free shipping until the end of this month.
[02:07:16.776 --> 02:07:20.358]  That's only a few more days, and the huge sales of July are over.
[02:07:20.618 --> 02:07:26.961]  Please support the broadcast, support yourself, and help fund the InfoWar in the face of this oppressive assault, because we're having victory.
[02:07:27.061 --> 02:07:29.042]  InfoWarStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:07:29.062 --> 02:07:29.702]  Thanks for your support.
[02:07:37.068 --> 02:07:40.072]  We accept the truth and fuck the system and the group collective.
[02:07:41.093 --> 02:07:44.857]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[02:07:46.219 --> 02:07:47.300]  This is the Info War.
[02:08:07.944 --> 02:08:10.145]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[02:08:10.205 --> 02:08:15.947]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:08:16.528 --> 02:08:20.329]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:08:27.392 --> 02:08:29.953]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:29.973 --> 02:08:33.315]  We're going to go to a clip in a second about the illegal alien
[02:08:34.157 --> 02:08:36.181]  Raped and robbed a woman in Portland.
[02:08:36.401 --> 02:08:39.228]  Had 20 deportations to his name.
[02:08:39.268 --> 02:08:41.994]  They tried to deport him 20 times.
[02:08:42.655 --> 02:08:43.597]  And then this happened.
[02:08:43.677 --> 02:08:44.599]  Well, what a surprise.
[02:08:45.228 --> 02:08:46.649]  We're going to go to that clip in a second.
[02:08:46.689 --> 02:08:48.510]  We have this report out of Fox News.
[02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:52.792]  House votes for 1.6 billion down payment on border wall.
[02:08:53.312 --> 02:09:02.557]  The GOP-controlled House has given tentative approval to a 1.6 billion down payment for President Trump's long-promised wall along the US-Mexico border.
[02:09:02.577 --> 02:09:09.661]  The controversial wall money is being given a ride on legislation to give the Pentagon a massive spending boost and increase funding for veterans medical care.
[02:09:10.121 --> 02:09:11.281]  So we've seen the plans.
[02:09:11.341 --> 02:09:12.722]  We've seen the preparations.
[02:09:13.162 --> 02:09:13.262]  DHS
[02:09:14.643 --> 02:09:16.485]  Leaked plans for this border wall.
[02:09:17.125 --> 02:09:22.649]  Many people still say it's never going to happen, just like they said Donald Trump would never win the presidency.
[02:09:23.110 --> 02:09:24.171]  The plans are in place.
[02:09:24.211 --> 02:09:26.672]  Now it seems the money is coming down the pipeline.
[02:09:27.433 --> 02:09:29.154]  And boy is it needed more than ever.
[02:09:29.194 --> 02:09:32.477]  We have this article from a couple of days ago out of the Gateway Pundit.
[02:09:44.657 --> 02:09:49.562]  Sergio Jose Martinez walked freely in Portland, Oregon and went on to yet another crime spree.
[02:09:49.963 --> 02:09:51.744]  He broke into the homes of two women.
[02:09:53.046 --> 02:09:56.870]  Two women where he raped them, robbed them of cash and other items and stole one of their cars.
[02:09:57.250 --> 02:10:03.737]  He'd previously been deported 20 times and we have a video clip on this right now.
[02:10:03.777 --> 02:10:04.538]  Let's roll the clip.
[02:10:06.067 --> 02:10:16.739]  The word sanctuary calls to mind someplace safe, but too often for families and victims affected by illegal immigrant crime, sanctuary cities are anything but safe.
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:25.209]  Instead, these cities are places that allow some criminals go free, undermine federal law enforcement, and make our communities less safe.
[02:10:30.103 --> 02:10:33.885]  Portland's next mayor is ready to defy our next president.
[02:10:34.285 --> 02:10:39.508]  Ted Wheeler says Portland will continue to be a sanctuary city for undocumented people.
[02:10:40.028 --> 02:10:45.951]  There's no place in this community for sexism or racism, religious intolerance or xenophobia.
[02:10:46.211 --> 02:10:54.855]  We want to make sure that women and people of color and people who've come to this country from other place feel safe and welcome in this community.
[02:10:55.356 --> 02:10:57.757]  Two violent attacks in one day.
[02:10:58.377 --> 02:11:05.782]  Both of these incidents appear to be stranger incidents, no connection to the victim, and incredibly violent.
[02:11:05.822 --> 02:11:14.789]  Sergio Martinez broke into a Northeast Portland home on Monday and raped a 65-year-old woman and after that assaulted another woman in a parking garage.
[02:11:15.049 --> 02:11:22.875]  We found out that 31-year-old Sergio Martinez has a long history of being deported to Mexico and then illegally re-entering the U.S.
[02:11:23.515 --> 02:11:26.217]  He's been deported 20 times to be exact.
[02:11:26.497 --> 02:11:32.202]  Martinez is being held on 13 charges from kidnapping to sex abuse to assault in these attacks.
[02:11:32.643 --> 02:11:38.368]  Now, court documents indicate his first victim says she was tied up by him before he sexually abused her.
[02:11:39.089 --> 02:11:43.493]  Coinsix has found he's got a long arrest record starting 15 years ago in California.
[02:11:43.953 --> 02:11:47.977]  He was convicted of burglary, battery, theft, and illegally entering the U.S.
[02:11:47.997 --> 02:11:50.960]  from Mexico at least 20 times after being deported.
[02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:56.004]  Court records show he's been living in Multnomah County for several months and says he's a transient.
[02:11:56.384 --> 02:12:00.647]  County records show he has nine failure-to-appear warrants going back several years.
[02:12:01.248 --> 02:12:07.973]  A question is whether these attacks could have been prevented if federal immigration agents were notified that Martinez was under arrest in the past.
[02:12:08.493 --> 02:12:17.840]  The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office tells me state law forbids them from using state resources for immigration enforcement and that's why they would not notify ICE, the U.S.
[02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:19.942]  Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.
[02:12:25.174 --> 02:12:27.497]  Absolutely incredible report there.
[02:12:27.777 --> 02:12:28.878]  We will remain open.
[02:12:29.159 --> 02:12:30.060]  We will remain welcoming.
[02:12:30.080 --> 02:12:31.361]  Absolutely incredible report.
[02:12:31.441 --> 02:12:34.364]  As I said, that is available on the Alex Jones Channel.
[02:12:35.145 --> 02:12:36.467]  That wall is getting built.
[02:12:36.527 --> 02:12:37.288]  It has to be built.
[02:12:37.348 --> 02:12:41.472]  At least the attempted illegal crossings are way down under Trump.
[02:12:41.532 --> 02:12:46.478]  That's another achievement that he doesn't get the praise he rightfully deserves for.
[02:12:47.609 --> 02:12:50.030]  So we'll be sure to continue to track that story.
[02:12:50.070 --> 02:12:52.190]  They tried to deport this guy 20 times.
[02:12:52.210 --> 02:12:53.990]  He came back to rape two women.
[02:12:54.370 --> 02:12:55.311]  God knows what else.
[02:12:56.031 --> 02:12:59.412]  Breaking news though about the North Korea situation which we talked about earlier.
[02:12:59.432 --> 02:13:02.852]  This is up on drudgereport.com out of the Washington Post.
[02:13:03.672 --> 02:13:07.953]  North Korea fires another missile, its latest step towards putting the US within reach.
[02:13:08.593 --> 02:13:15.675]  North Korea has taken another bold step towards achieving its stated goal of being able to send a nuclear weapon to the US mainland
[02:13:16.656 --> 02:13:19.579]  Can you imagine the panic if that becomes a reality?
[02:13:20.019 --> 02:13:25.884]  Firing another intercontinental ballistic missile late Friday and highlighting the regime's rapid technological progress.
[02:13:26.445 --> 02:13:33.932]  The missile flew almost straight for 45 minutes and reached a height of about 2,300 miles before crashing into the sea off Japan.
[02:13:34.612 --> 02:13:41.899]  But if it had been launched on a normal trajectory, the missile could theoretically have reached Denver
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:56.065]  And perhaps even Chicago experts said the latest provocation compounds a problem facing the Trump administration and North Korea's neighbors, how to stop the regime of Kim Jong-un from making progress with its nuclear weapons program.
[02:13:57.125 --> 02:14:04.267]  Now given the fact that Donald Trump's approval rating as of today is at its lowest ever, 41%
[02:14:07.142 --> 02:14:08.583]  I mean, could he go wag the dog?
[02:14:08.623 --> 02:14:09.824]  That's the big question here.
[02:14:10.304 --> 02:14:28.196]  Although the polls that I've conducted, and most of my Twitter followers are obviously big Trump supporters, say that any potential attack on North Korea or attempt to unseat, to overthrow the dictatorship of North Korea would be way more popular amongst Trump's base
[02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:36.863]  Than, for example, the attack on Syria, which wasn't popular amongst probably the slight majority of Trump's base, according to the polls.
[02:14:38.243 --> 02:14:56.370]  That North Korea attack, if it comes, will be more popular, it will be supported by more people, because again, you don't have the risk, although there's obviously a huge risk to South Korea, to other countries in the region, you wouldn't have the wider risk of extremists taking control of a country, taking control of nuclear weapons,
[02:14:57.165 --> 02:15:01.686]  Because you could have a conflagration with China, which could lead to World War 3.
[02:15:02.746 --> 02:15:18.970]  This is the situation we're dealing with, a potentially apocalyptic scenario, but still one that has more support amongst Trump's base, simply because of the horror stories that come out of North Korea and which have generally been proven true by the defectors who come over.
[02:15:18.990 --> 02:15:19.691]  200,000 people
[02:15:22.017 --> 02:15:35.243]  Political dissidents, not even criminals, political dissidents who have expressed thought crimes literally in gulags, literally in camps where the women give birth to babies and the guards immediately stamp them to death.
[02:15:35.984 --> 02:15:46.709]  This is a country where everybody by law has to have a radio in their apartment broadcasting government propaganda non-stop which can't be turned off.
[02:15:47.349 --> 02:15:49.930]  Can you imagine how Orwellian that is?
[02:15:49.950 --> 02:15:51.071]  This is
[02:15:52.411 --> 02:15:56.093]  Easily the most authoritarian country in the world.
[02:15:56.474 --> 02:16:00.116]  Its population is enslaved to a cult of dictatorship.
[02:16:00.436 --> 02:16:08.741]  That's why there is widespread support for actual regime change in this country, despite the potential consequences.
[02:16:09.041 --> 02:16:16.145]  Could we be moving closer towards that given what has happened today with yet another North Korea missile launch, which they claim
[02:16:17.384 --> 02:16:21.965]  If it was on the right trajectory, it could have reached Denver or Chicago.
[02:16:22.765 --> 02:16:27.286]  Absolutely insane story breaking on this Friday afternoon.
[02:16:28.366 --> 02:16:33.507]  Moving on, though, we'll get back into the migrant crisis, as I said earlier, in a little while.
[02:16:34.027 --> 02:16:36.808]  But this is a big story which I mentioned earlier with Roger Stone.
[02:16:37.868 --> 02:16:43.949]  Report, top FBI lawyer James A. Baker under investigation for leaking classified info to media.
[02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:53.988]  FBI General Counsel James Baker, Comey confidant, is allegedly under criminal investigation by the Department of Justice for leaking classified info to the media.
[02:16:54.688 --> 02:17:09.380]  Three sources with knowledge of the investigation told Circa that Baker is the top suspect in an ongoing leak investigation, but Circa has not been able to confirm the details of what national security information or material was allegedly leaked.
[02:17:10.316 --> 02:17:14.977]  So they finally zeroed in on one of these individuals responsible for the leaks.
[02:17:15.017 --> 02:17:17.757]  Of course, that's what Scaramucci was put there to do.
[02:17:18.397 --> 02:17:20.018]  He's promised to crack down on that.
[02:17:20.338 --> 02:17:22.638]  What will it take for these leaks to stop?
[02:17:23.718 --> 02:17:25.359]  Now they're even leaking on Scaramucci.
[02:17:25.379 --> 02:17:29.239]  He asked them for a period of grace, these traitors within the White House.
[02:17:29.279 --> 02:17:30.459]  He asked them for a honeymoon.
[02:17:30.719 --> 02:17:32.800]  That lasted all of, what, four days?
[02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:36.480]  Now they're leaking information on his financial history.
[02:17:37.061 --> 02:17:39.581]  But finally they've zeroed in on this one individual
[02:17:40.262 --> 02:17:47.171]  Basically someone needs to be put in prison for a very long time and then you'll see the leaks dry up overnight.
[02:17:47.231 --> 02:17:49.153]  That's what Scaramucci's put there to do.
[02:17:49.774 --> 02:17:51.316]  But I mean is it too little too late?
[02:17:51.336 --> 02:17:56.522]  We have Pat Buchanan writing today, is Trump entering a kill box?
[02:17:57.223 --> 02:17:59.726]  This article is posted on InfoWars.com.
[02:18:00.498 --> 02:18:26.958]  Where he's talking about Jeff Sessions, where he's talking about the fact, as Roger Stone said earlier, the Mueller investigation now is basically very little to do with Russian collusion and everything to do with dredging up anything about Donald Trump, even from way before he even ran as a candidate, on his business, financial transactions, on who he rented apartments to, to find any speck of dirt.
[02:18:27.478 --> 02:18:37.068]  Which they can blow out of all proportions to start the ball rolling to not only delegitimize but eventually unseat and impeach President Trump.
[02:18:37.489 --> 02:18:38.650]  That's what this is about.
[02:18:39.011 --> 02:18:40.232]  It's a pure witch hunt.
[02:18:40.492 --> 02:18:42.995]  They've got no evidence whatsoever of Russian collusion.
[02:18:43.275 --> 02:18:44.436]  Meanwhile over at the DNC,
[02:18:45.805 --> 02:19:01.715]  You literally have people working within the IT systems, colluding with foreign governments, colluding with the Muslim Brotherhood, wiring $300,000 to Pakistan, smashing up hard drives, and Debbie Wasserman Schultz still employs them.
[02:19:01.755 --> 02:19:05.037]  Not only employs them, as Roger Stone said earlier, promotes them.
[02:19:05.497 --> 02:19:07.218]  Months after that becomes known.
[02:19:08.115 --> 02:19:13.241]  Absolutely mammoth, monumental scandal from within the DNC.
[02:19:13.742 --> 02:19:18.187]  Actual proof of collusion with a foreign government, with a foreign terrorist organisation.
[02:19:18.866 --> 02:19:19.346]  CNN?
[02:19:19.887 --> 02:19:21.608]  Nothing whatsoever to say about it.
[02:19:21.648 --> 02:19:28.671]  This is how they control reality, by just ignoring, blacklisting the biggest scandal.
[02:19:29.352 --> 02:19:36.136]  One of the biggest scandals, if not the biggest scandal politically this year, being completely blacklisted.
[02:19:36.456 --> 02:19:38.257]  But we're going to continue talking about it.
[02:19:38.557 --> 02:19:47.582]  But again, that investigation into Trump, any single speck of dirt they can find, nothing to do with Russian collusion, they will use it.
[02:19:48.678 --> 02:19:50.782]  To impeach, to indict President Trump.
[02:19:50.922 --> 02:19:51.804]  That's where it's going.
[02:19:51.844 --> 02:19:54.809]  That was the agenda from the very beginning.
[02:19:54.829 --> 02:19:58.896]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live to talk about the latest with the migrant crisis.
[02:19:59.417 --> 02:20:00.699]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[02:20:01.039 --> 02:20:02.221]  Don't go away.
[02:20:04.156 --> 02:20:16.288]  Since the time of Hippocrates, the father of modern western medicine, in 420 BC, the ancients have marveled at the power of whey protein from milk and cheese.
[02:20:16.468 --> 02:20:23.836]  That's why I'm so proud to announce the latest addition to the InfoWars Life family, true whey protein from InfoWars Life.
[02:20:24.156 --> 02:20:30.101]  It's produced right here in the United States of America under the strictest high quality organic conditions.
[02:20:30.661 --> 02:20:37.407]  Our True Whey Protein from InfoWars Life contains a whopping 20 grams of protein per serving.
[02:20:37.847 --> 02:20:45.033]  We went out and did massive research and found the very best company and facility to develop our whey.
[02:20:45.213 --> 02:20:57.876]  And it took us years to finally get contacts with some of the larger, most respected companies to bring you a super high quality whey protein at a very reasonable price.
[02:20:58.376 --> 02:21:05.938]  That way you get the benefits and the taste of high quality whey while supporting our information warfare operation against the globalists.
[02:21:06.258 --> 02:21:08.759]  Doing our research, one thing continued to really stand out.
[02:21:09.319 --> 02:21:18.001]  It's not just that cows and their milk are associated with the best, highest quality protein, but also that those cows be grass-fed.
[02:21:18.401 --> 02:21:19.221]  That is essential.
[02:21:19.601 --> 02:21:23.902]  And all of this whey protein comes from grass-fed, happy cows.
[02:21:24.383 --> 02:21:26.823]  This is the very best way that we were able to bring to market.
[02:21:27.183 --> 02:21:28.884]  Please try it for yourself and tell us what you think.
[02:21:28.924 --> 02:21:30.624]  Again, thank you so much for all your support.
[02:21:31.164 --> 02:21:33.685]  It is true whey from mfulwardslive.com.
[02:21:34.898 --> 02:21:39.762]  DNA Force is finally back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.

[02:21:52.753 --> 02:21:54.574]  Optimize cellular energy.
[02:21:55.315 --> 02:21:56.216]  It's DNA Force.
[02:21:56.256 --> 02:21:58.137]  It's available for a limited time only.

[02:22:11.852 --> 02:22:18.436]  Dealing with the martial law, civil war, assassination, removal, sudden removal, coup of Trump.
[02:22:18.936 --> 02:22:20.817]  All of this is now confirmed.
[02:22:21.178 --> 02:22:24.039]  Talk about sensationally fantastic.
[02:22:25.420 --> 02:22:27.101]  Talk about living in incredible times.
[02:22:27.181 --> 02:22:30.423]  Talk about America and the world at the crossroads.
[02:22:30.463 --> 02:22:30.944]  This is it.
[02:22:31.924 --> 02:22:34.566]  And now, more than ever, we need your financial support.
[02:22:34.626 --> 02:22:36.587]  We have the very best products you need.
[02:22:37.007 --> 02:22:39.508]  Incredible air filtration systems that are $219.
[02:22:39.548 --> 02:22:39.929]  Similar units are $400, $600.
[02:22:39.989 --> 02:22:41.189]  Used to be like $800 a few years ago.
[02:22:41.209 --> 02:22:42.110]  The prices are going down.
[02:22:42.130 --> 02:22:42.590]  They're $149 right now.
[02:22:49.674 --> 02:22:50.815]  $149, normally $219.
[02:22:50.935 --> 02:22:53.277]  That is the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:22:53.397 --> 02:22:56.380]  The very same type systems, again, are $400 on average, upwards of $600.
[02:22:56.660 --> 02:22:59.763]  Pro Pure Travel are the very best gravity-fed systems out there.
[02:22:59.783 --> 02:23:00.203]  30% off, $132.
[02:23:00.303 --> 02:23:02.926]  The other competitors aren't even as good, and they sell them for $200, $230.
[02:23:03.046 --> 02:23:03.506]  That's $132 right now.
[02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:11.112]  Super Silver Special, the electric toothbrush that has silver impregnated in it.
[02:23:11.512 --> 02:23:11.972]  Amazing.
[02:23:12.152 --> 02:23:13.973]  And the Ployol Silver toothpaste.
[02:23:14.513 --> 02:23:16.834]  Super Blue and the Silver Bullet Ployol Silver.
[02:23:17.514 --> 02:23:18.115]  50% off.
[02:23:18.375 --> 02:23:19.455]  We've never done a special that big.
[02:23:19.796 --> 02:23:21.977]  Caveman Combo, 25% off the bone broth.
[02:23:22.117 --> 02:23:24.358]  Super Female, 57% off.
[02:23:24.418 --> 02:23:25.058]  And why is that?
[02:23:25.138 --> 02:23:27.139]  Because we're basically sold out of the Super Male.
[02:23:27.239 --> 02:23:28.179]  I can't discount that.
[02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:31.281]  Super Female is very, very similar and works on men as well.
[02:23:31.301 --> 02:23:32.141]  But I want women.
[02:23:32.161 --> 02:23:33.742]  It's never really caught on with women for some reason.
[02:23:33.882 --> 02:23:34.222]  We should.
[02:23:34.342 --> 02:23:37.083]  It's even more dramatic than what I've seen in women, when it comes to libido at least.
[02:23:37.344 --> 02:23:39.364]  But stamina, energy, just read the reviews.
[02:23:39.565 --> 02:23:41.685]  Super female, 57% off.
[02:23:41.866 --> 02:23:43.226]  And so many other big specials.

[02:23:59.213 --> 02:23:59.874]  Thanks for your support.
[02:24:17.561 --> 02:24:19.763]  We are back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:19.783 --> 02:24:26.308]  Before we dip back into the news, I want to tell you about an exciting new product at Infowarslife.com.
[02:24:26.829 --> 02:24:32.454]  It is the new True Whey Protein and it's available right now for 25% off retail.
[02:24:32.474 --> 02:24:34.315]  That's just £29.95.
[02:24:34.916 --> 02:24:37.238]  Introductory pricing at Infowarslife.com.
[02:24:37.258 --> 02:24:39.840]  This is the ultimate protein pack.
[02:24:40.684 --> 02:24:43.405]  25% off of Caveman and True Whey Protein.
[02:24:43.845 --> 02:24:45.605]  This is a grass-fed whey protein.
[02:24:45.905 --> 02:24:49.146]  It's available now in 4WarsLife.com in a very limited first run.
[02:24:49.686 --> 02:24:57.068]  In 4WarsLife, True Whey Protein contains all nine essential amino acids your body needs but cannot produce itself.
[02:24:57.568 --> 02:25:01.589]  It's considered a complete protein and is also low in lactose content.
[02:25:02.009 --> 02:25:07.971]  Whey protein, a byproduct of milk and cheese, was promoted for its health benefits as early as 420 BC.
[02:25:08.671 --> 02:25:09.191]  At that time,
[02:25:10.171 --> 02:25:20.762]  They recommend whey to patients, and besides providing all of the essential amino acids your body needs, the high-quality grass-fed whey protein also contains three ingredients of particular importance for health.
[02:25:22.423 --> 02:25:24.726]  And it's available at infowarslife.com.
[02:25:24.746 --> 02:25:29.711]  Of course, if you're into weightlifting, bodybuilding, or just, you know, staying in shape,
[02:25:30.535 --> 02:25:36.880]  You need protein as part of your diet, an additional source of protein, and we have it.
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:38.521]  It is True Whey Protein.
[02:25:38.561 --> 02:25:45.766]  It's available right now in 4WarsLife.com for that special low introductory price of £29.95.
[02:25:45.806 --> 02:25:48.368]  That's a 25% discount.

[02:25:51.390 --> 02:25:53.512]  We also have the free shipping store-wide.

[02:26:00.693 --> 02:26:02.053]  Save a ton of money on that.
[02:26:02.333 --> 02:26:04.875]  We also have the last week of July specials.
[02:26:05.255 --> 02:26:10.398]  Huge discounts on a ton of products, including the Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:26:11.158 --> 02:26:12.499]  Mugs, the coffee mugs.
[02:26:12.759 --> 02:26:20.864]  Chunky, high quality coffee mugs that really are conversation starters and liberal triggers.
[02:26:21.707 --> 02:26:26.010]  Absolutely essential product and that's available at 33% off for either one.
[02:26:26.470 --> 02:26:27.111]  Both are great.
[02:26:27.171 --> 02:26:28.052]  Two different designs.
[02:26:28.752 --> 02:26:30.593]  Conservatism is a new counterculture.
[02:26:30.693 --> 02:26:33.535]  CoffeeMug at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:26:33.816 --> 02:26:35.857]  Please support us today.
[02:26:35.877 --> 02:26:37.258]  We really appreciate it.
[02:26:37.298 --> 02:26:41.581]  You've really come through for us, especially over the past six, seven months when the attacks
[02:26:42.173 --> 02:26:53.761]  In the aftermath of the election, were more intense than ever before, and you've had our back at every single point by getting the products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:26:55.022 --> 02:26:56.803]  Let's dip back into some news right now.
[02:26:57.564 --> 02:27:07.951]  Of course, there was the big New Yorker article last night, where Scaramucci came out and basically threw some shade at Bannon, used some swear words, God forbid, said the F word,
[02:27:08.621 --> 02:27:10.342]  Well now he's regretting that today.
[02:27:10.382 --> 02:27:14.125]  The Daily Caller reports, never should have trusted a reporter.
[02:27:14.465 --> 02:27:16.847]  Scaramucci responds to the New Yorker piece.
[02:27:17.568 --> 02:27:24.733]  White House Communications Director Antony Scaramucci responded to a Thursday New Yorker piece by saying he should never have trusted a reporter.
[02:27:25.153 --> 02:27:35.981]  Scaramucci's tweet implied that he would not make that mistake again after a New Yorker piece on Scaramucci featured numerous quotes from him about White House leaks after he unloaded on a reporter during a phone call.
[02:27:36.934 --> 02:27:39.757]  Quote, I made a mistake entrusting a reporter, it won't happen again.
[02:27:39.777 --> 02:27:57.556]  So Scaramucci basically called up this reporter as part of his mission to try and identify leakers, because this reporter had got something from someone within the administration about a private dinner that Trump had had with First Lady Melania Trump, Sean Hannity of Fox News and Bill Shine.
[02:27:58.490 --> 02:28:01.933]  This was leaked to the New Yorker reporter Ryan Lizza.
[02:28:02.373 --> 02:28:03.794]  So Scaramucci called him.
[02:28:04.074 --> 02:28:04.815]  He was incensed.
[02:28:04.895 --> 02:28:06.916]  He wanted to know the identity of the leaker.
[02:28:08.477 --> 02:28:09.298]  Different claims.
[02:28:09.338 --> 02:28:11.840]  Scaramucci thinks the conversation was off record.
[02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:14.722]  The New Yorker reporter obviously thinks it was on record.
[02:28:15.022 --> 02:28:18.145]  That's what started this scandal which broke last night.
[02:28:18.425 --> 02:28:19.666]  Not really a scandal.
[02:28:19.686 --> 02:28:21.047]  Another nothing burger.
[02:28:22.508 --> 02:28:23.268]  Trump Jr.
[02:28:23.308 --> 02:28:24.189]  Donald Trump Jr.
[02:28:24.209 --> 02:28:25.110]  tweeted this today.
[02:28:26.161 --> 02:28:31.092]  Shocked the media is going after at Scaramucci for working to cut off their sources and leaks.
[02:28:31.312 --> 02:28:34.379]  All I know is that he isn't, wasn't the lead.
[02:28:34.720 --> 02:28:35.221]  So that...
[02:28:36.255 --> 02:28:37.536]  Really encapsulates it.
[02:28:37.596 --> 02:29:01.717]  That's why they hate Scaramucci, because if he is successful in cracking down on these leakers, in putting some of them in prison, at least firing them for the time being, that's it for the New York Times, that's it for the Washington Post, that's it for the New Yorker in terms of leaks from these traitors, from these turncoats, from these never-Trumpers, from these Obama holdovers within the administration.
[02:29:02.276 --> 02:29:30.173]  And at that point, Trump can then get on the offensive and push forward with the narrative of his agenda, the successes that he's had, which is obviously the economy, the illegal border crossings being down, moving towards building the wall, et cetera, et cetera, not obsessing about hysterical nothing burger Russian conspiracy theories and all this backbiting between individuals within the administration that don't have Trump's back.
[02:29:31.030 --> 02:29:32.731]  That's why they hate Scaramucci.
[02:29:32.971 --> 02:29:36.413]  That's why they're now trying to bring him down as well.
[02:29:37.094 --> 02:29:38.275]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:29:38.775 --> 02:29:41.216]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:41.237 --> 02:29:43.018]  I'm going to get into the migrant crisis.
[02:29:43.358 --> 02:29:44.439]  Huge news with that.
[02:29:44.799 --> 02:29:45.579]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:29:45.639 --> 02:29:47.621]  Breaking news at Infowars.com.
[02:29:47.661 --> 02:29:48.181]  We'll be back.
[02:29:52.504 --> 02:29:53.404]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.905 --> 02:29:55.506]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.446 --> 02:29:59.108]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.982 --> 02:30:10.865]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[02:30:11.125 --> 02:30:20.850]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken, and it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[02:30:20.910 --> 02:30:23.892]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[02:30:24.152 --> 02:30:25.372]  It's Brain Force Plus.

[02:30:34.216 --> 02:30:37.738]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[02:30:38.198 --> 02:30:44.241]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[02:30:44.661 --> 02:30:47.442]  It is the new t-shirt from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:47.823 --> 02:30:50.844]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:30:51.044 --> 02:30:54.486]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[02:30:54.826 --> 02:30:55.266]  The left
[02:30:55.626 --> 02:30:56.567]  ...controls culture.
[02:30:56.587 --> 02:30:57.568]  They control arts.
[02:30:57.628 --> 02:30:58.869]  They control entertainment.
[02:30:59.169 --> 02:31:06.256]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:31:06.296 --> 02:31:08.718]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[02:31:09.199 --> 02:31:13.063]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[02:31:13.123 --> 02:31:15.184]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[02:31:15.805 --> 02:31:21.170]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[02:31:21.430 --> 02:31:27.676]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[02:31:27.756 --> 02:31:29.458]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[02:31:29.598 --> 02:31:30.799]  It's available right now.
[02:31:31.119 --> 02:31:33.301]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:34.602 --> 02:31:37.025]  They use their media to assassinate Real News.
[02:31:37.625 --> 02:31:41.349]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:48.577]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[02:31:49.217 --> 02:31:52.361]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[02:31:53.061 --> 02:32:12.663]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding, until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[02:32:13.203 --> 02:32:16.826]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[02:32:17.347 --> 02:32:27.836]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom, is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[02:32:28.636 --> 02:32:33.781]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America, and I'm freedom's safest place.
[02:32:34.441 --> 02:32:37.102]  Look, I'm not gonna sit here and say, see, I told you so.
[02:32:37.342 --> 02:32:40.402]  That communist Chinese-style net censorship is coming to the web.
[02:32:40.682 --> 02:32:41.483]  Because it's already here.
[02:32:41.863 --> 02:32:42.523]  It's being announced.
[02:32:42.883 --> 02:32:46.363]  The way you keep the internet open and free is you get involved more than ever.

[02:32:54.645 --> 02:32:57.026]  You gonna sit down and play games and be a trendy?
[02:32:57.746 --> 02:32:58.646]  Or you gonna be part of history?
[02:32:59.206 --> 02:33:02.207]  Don't sit by and let the internet and free speech be stolen from you.
[02:33:02.707 --> 02:33:03.267]  Take action!
[02:33:12.319 --> 02:33:20.441]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure, you're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.321 --> 02:33:29.083]  We are live deep in the third hour of this Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:29.103 --> 02:33:32.884]  I'm going to talk about The Migrant Crisis, the latest on that here in a moment.
[02:33:32.964 --> 02:33:36.925]  First I want to go to this Adam Carolla clip though because this is quite unusual.
[02:33:37.849 --> 02:33:42.310]  He got up before a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee with several other speakers.
[02:33:42.978 --> 02:33:45.239]  The headline here is out of Washington Free Beacon.
[02:33:45.299 --> 02:33:50.041]  Adam Carolla goes to Congress, says adults need to take back college campuses.
[02:33:50.601 --> 02:34:00.105]  Comedian Adam Carolla was invited to testify before the Congress on the state of free speech at American universities and said that it was time for the adults to take back control.
[02:34:00.525 --> 02:34:09.029]  Here is the clip of Adam Carolla laying it down on the safe spaces who are ruining, sabotaging free speech in America.
[02:34:09.069 --> 02:34:09.569]  Let's roll it.
[02:34:10.209 --> 02:34:12.570]  Mr. Carolla, you're recognized for five minutes.
[02:34:12.630 --> 02:34:12.950]  Thank you.
[02:34:12.990 --> 02:34:16.612]  It's an honor to be asked to speak in front of you all.
[02:34:16.652 --> 02:34:17.972]  First, just a quick piece of business.
[02:34:17.992 --> 02:34:19.533]  Do we get to keep these pads?
[02:34:21.894 --> 02:34:23.154]  This is gonna be huge.
[02:34:26.553 --> 02:34:29.135]  Not that I'm going to, but what do you reckon they'll get on eBay?
[02:34:30.476 --> 02:34:33.418]  I'm not saying I'm going to, it's just pure curiosity.
[02:34:36.821 --> 02:34:39.203]  I'm not as eloquent as Mr. Shapiro.
[02:34:39.283 --> 02:34:43.166]  I sort of speak in beats and off the top of my head.
[02:34:43.226 --> 02:34:45.087]  I've written a few down for you all today.
[02:34:45.467 --> 02:34:45.908]  First off,
[02:34:46.628 --> 02:34:49.550]  I come from a very blue-collar background.
[02:34:49.610 --> 02:34:51.772]  I grew up in North Hollywood, California.
[02:34:52.912 --> 02:35:07.563]  My dad was a school teacher and my mom received welfare and food stamps and told me very importantly when I was young, when I asked her if she would get a job, she said, and lose my welfare benefits, no thank you.
[02:35:08.003 --> 02:35:12.166]  Which taught me a very valuable lesson, which was never to listen to my mom.
[02:35:14.758 --> 02:35:27.068]  I ended up being a carpenter and then a boxing instructor and met Jimmy Kimmel when I taught him to box for a morning zoo stunt and eventually made my way onto TV and radio.
[02:35:27.609 --> 02:35:39.378]  In the early days of my career, I toured the country with Dr. Drew when we were on Loveline together, a syndicated radio program also on MTV, and we must have played a hundred
[02:35:39.898 --> 02:35:49.563]  College campuses with a nary a word of negativity and no safe spaces and no stuffed animals being handed out.
[02:35:49.623 --> 02:35:51.444]  Simply went there, said our piece.
[02:35:51.664 --> 02:35:56.307]  Many controversial ideas were exchanged and that's just what they were.
[02:35:57.047 --> 02:36:01.690]  Exchanged and then we got our paychecks and went home and 15 years later I went out
[02:36:03.911 --> 02:36:18.067]  With Dennis Prager, conservative talk show host, and attempted to do a show at Cal State Northridge, where my mother was an actual graduate from with a Chicano Studies degree, believe it or not.
[02:36:18.107 --> 02:36:20.530]  So she's rolling in dough about now.
[02:36:23.004 --> 02:36:24.665]  And they pulled the plug on it.
[02:36:24.985 --> 02:36:33.749]  They gave us no good reason why we couldn't speak there and we actually had to get attorneys involved to go back and speak at a later date.
[02:36:35.882 --> 02:36:40.304]  We're talking a lot about the kids, and I think they're just that, kids.
[02:36:40.644 --> 02:36:45.547]  We are the adults, and I don't think we are doing the children.
[02:36:45.567 --> 02:36:51.109]  I mean, these are 18 and 19-year-old kids that are at these college campuses.
[02:36:51.169 --> 02:37:00.014]  They grew up dipped in Purell, playing soccer games where they never kept score, and watching Wawa Wubbzy, and we're asking them to be mature.
[02:37:00.134 --> 02:37:03.135]  We need the adults to start being the adults.
[02:37:04.796 --> 02:37:15.223]  Studies have shown that if you take people and you put them in a zero gravity environment, like astronauts, they lose muscle mass, they lose bone density.
[02:37:15.563 --> 02:37:24.909]  We're taking these kids in the name of protection, we're putting them in a zero gravity environment, and they're losing muscle mass and bone density.
[02:37:25.290 --> 02:37:27.631]  They need to live in a world that has gravity.
[02:37:28.032 --> 02:37:28.332]  When you
[02:37:28.852 --> 02:37:35.297]  You need to expose your children to germs and dirt in the environment to build up their immune system.
[02:37:35.857 --> 02:37:44.504]  Our plan is put them in a bubble, keep them away from everything, and somehow they'll come out stronger when they emerge from the bubble.
[02:37:44.684 --> 02:37:46.065]  Well, that's not happening.
[02:37:47.086 --> 02:37:51.810]  Children are the future, but we are the present.
[02:37:52.650 --> 02:37:53.691]  And we're the adults.
[02:37:54.372 --> 02:37:55.913]  And we need to act like it.
[02:37:56.453 --> 02:37:57.194]  And I feel
[02:37:58.629 --> 02:38:02.414]  That what's going on on these campuses is...
[02:38:05.649 --> 02:38:06.930]  We need law and order.
[02:38:07.271 --> 02:38:08.992]  We need to bring back law and order.
[02:38:09.052 --> 02:38:13.796]  But I think if we just had order, we wouldn't need law.
[02:38:14.597 --> 02:38:29.530]  So could we just bring back order, and could the faculty and administration on these campuses act like faculty and administration, and most importantly, adults
[02:38:30.717 --> 02:38:36.621]  We're in charge of these kids who need some gravity in their life.
[02:38:37.201 --> 02:38:37.581]  Thank you.
[02:38:39.603 --> 02:38:40.964]  And that really gets to the heart of it.
[02:38:41.124 --> 02:38:47.228]  The responsibility lies with the adults, as we've seen with these Berkeley protests and these other protesters.
[02:38:47.868 --> 02:38:52.291]  Many of the rioters are not kids, they're not students, they're the professors.
[02:38:53.214 --> 02:38:54.975]  This is the root of the problem.
[02:38:55.535 --> 02:39:13.163]  Now over in the UK, as we saw this week, we've literally got teachers, I mean the media billed him as a historian but he was just a teacher, teaching kids that a typical Roman family in Britain 1,500 years ago, typical Roman family in Britain, was black.
[02:39:13.623 --> 02:39:16.264]  Absolutely, completely historically inaccurate.
[02:39:16.564 --> 02:39:22.467]  You had hit pieces on me put out after that by national newspapers claiming that I was wrong
[02:39:23.604 --> 02:39:30.289]  For saying that depicting Victorian-era Britain as a bunch of Muslim women in hijabs, that was ludicrous.
[02:39:30.810 --> 02:39:44.961]  I was owned for saying that because they said, oh, there was one mosque built in London 12 years before Queen Victoria died, therefore it's fair to depict Victorian-era Britain as all Muslim women in hijabs.
[02:39:45.822 --> 02:39:49.525]  Absolutely incredible disinformation, indoctrination.
[02:39:49.805 --> 02:39:52.107]  They're literally trying to rewrite history.
[02:39:52.714 --> 02:39:54.697]  I mean, there's a story today out of RT.
[02:39:55.478 --> 02:39:59.323]  Alien toddler skeleton with deformed skull unearthed in Crimea.
[02:39:59.924 --> 02:40:07.255]  So they basically found a one and a half year old boy who was born in second century Crimea with a deformed skull.
[02:40:08.177 --> 02:40:10.558]  They're calling it the alien toddler skeleton.
[02:40:10.978 --> 02:40:13.759]  And that was a similar thing with the debate over Rome and Britain.
[02:40:14.180 --> 02:40:23.343]  They found some skeletons, I think it was three or four skeletons, of black people in London who lived in London 1,500 years ago.
[02:40:23.884 --> 02:40:29.926]  Therefore they claimed that Rome and Britain was ethnically diverse because they found a few skeletons.
[02:40:30.466 --> 02:40:31.547]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:40:31.827 --> 02:40:36.689]  That is as ludicrous as saying that because they found this alien toddler skeleton,
[02:40:37.398 --> 02:40:47.646]  In Crimea, that second century Crimeans all looked like alien greys because everyone has to look like this tiny sample of the argument you're claiming.
[02:40:47.706 --> 02:40:51.889]  No, that's a completely historically inaccurate argument.
[02:40:52.529 --> 02:41:00.195]  Even with all the black slaves that the Romans had and brought over into Britain, it was still a tiny, tiny percentage of the population
[02:41:00.936 --> 02:41:05.661]  It's completely inaccurate to claim that Rome and Britain was ethnically diverse.
[02:41:05.721 --> 02:41:14.890]  It's completely inaccurate to claim that a typical family in Rome and Britain, as the BBC did, was black, and depict it as a black family.
[02:41:15.130 --> 02:41:16.352]  That's not typical!
[02:41:16.932 --> 02:41:18.414]  That would be incredibly rare.
[02:41:18.675 --> 02:41:28.408]  Why has every other previous depiction of Roman Britain shown all white people, including the BBC's own depictions, before this 2017 depiction?
[02:41:28.728 --> 02:41:32.894]  They injected that with politically correct racial tokenism
[02:41:33.374 --> 02:41:36.375]  At the expense of historical accuracy.
[02:41:36.715 --> 02:41:41.116]  That's the issue, and that's the issue about what our kids are being taught in these schools right now.
[02:41:41.376 --> 02:41:51.638]  The professors are worse than the kids in many cases, and that is the heart of the problem, as Adam Carolla said in that speech in front of a congressional committee.
[02:41:52.798 --> 02:41:58.639]  But let's dip back into some of the migrant news now, because it continues to wash over us on a daily basis.
[02:41:58.659 --> 02:42:02.820]  We talked with Tommy Robinson about the Muslim leader in Australia,
[02:42:03.607 --> 02:42:06.728]  He's saying that Australian women need us to fertilise them.
[02:42:06.768 --> 02:42:18.472]  He's literally saying that bigoted white people should just all kill themselves now, because they're going to die out anyway, and that they need to import vast more numbers of Muslims just to maintain the population.
[02:42:18.832 --> 02:42:24.534]  Of course, that's a myth in itself, that a declining population is always a bad thing.
[02:42:24.874 --> 02:42:26.215]  It's not always a bad thing.
[02:42:26.275 --> 02:42:27.215]  It can be managed.
[02:42:27.535 --> 02:42:35.383]  But it is true to say that sperm counts are dropping, that white Western Europeans are basically going extinct because none of them are having babies.
[02:42:35.743 --> 02:42:45.733]  So now you have Muslim leaders in Australia celebrating that fact that white people are basically being ethnically cleansed by their own volition.
[02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:52.065]  We have the BBC refusing to report on a Muslim mob who attacked whites for being non-Muslims.
[02:42:52.105 --> 02:42:53.086]  We reported on that.
[02:42:53.546 --> 02:42:57.990]  They reported on a guy who made a YouTube video saying he was going to kill Muslims.
[02:42:58.171 --> 02:42:59.212]  That was hate speech.
[02:42:59.452 --> 02:42:59.992]  Words!
[02:43:00.513 --> 02:43:06.438]  When it comes to actual violent physical attacks on people on the street, where they're asking people, are you Muslim?
[02:43:06.478 --> 02:43:07.319]  Yes, I'm Muslim.
[02:43:07.339 --> 02:43:07.880]  They recite
[02:43:08.695 --> 02:43:11.036]  The secret code words to prove they're Muslims.
[02:43:11.076 --> 02:43:12.737]  They don't get attacked, they get left alone.
[02:43:13.037 --> 02:43:17.578]  They go to the next person who says, I'm a Christian, gets the crap beaten out of him.
[02:43:18.239 --> 02:43:22.280]  Targeting non-Muslim, white people, an obvious hate crime.
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:28.343]  It's not even being reported on by the local BBC Merseyside section of the news.
[02:43:29.443 --> 02:43:31.784]  That's how locked down they've got this narrative.
[02:43:32.084 --> 02:43:37.346]  You had the Labour councillor being attacked and then making excuses for it, as Tommy Robinson talked about.
[02:43:38.078 --> 02:43:39.919]  Absolutely incredible situation.
[02:43:40.319 --> 02:43:44.401]  You have the situation in Birmingham where a 15-year-old girl got raped twice.
[02:43:45.281 --> 02:43:47.322]  They said, oh, it was a couple of Asian men.
[02:43:47.462 --> 02:43:51.144]  They didn't even give a specific description of them.
[02:43:51.184 --> 02:43:52.265]  They're still on the loose.
[02:43:53.025 --> 02:43:56.907]  We have this article out of Breitbart, which is also up on Infowars.com.
[02:43:58.187 --> 02:44:01.609]  Swedish shop refuses woman's service for not wearing a hijab.
[02:44:02.361 --> 02:44:12.823]  A woman in Sweden claims that she was denied service at a local Somalian-owned shop because she was not wearing an Islamic headscarf and remarks she felt like she was back in her home country of Iran.
[02:44:14.013 --> 02:44:25.595]  Bearing in mind that the original feminist Arab Muslim groups back over a hundred years ago, one of the first things they did, actual feminists, was to discard their veils.
[02:44:26.155 --> 02:44:33.277]  Now the hijab is celebrated as a symbol of female empowerment by Western leftist feminists.
[02:44:33.497 --> 02:44:35.077]  Absolutely incredible turnaround.
[02:44:35.637 --> 02:44:40.278]  The article continues, the woman, a well-known Swedish female rights activist named Shola For,
[02:44:41.010 --> 02:44:52.633]  Said that she was out shopping for dresses and was shown some by the female retail clerk shortly after a man, who she deduced to be the owner of the shop, spoke with the clerk in Somali in about four and her lack of a hijab.
[02:44:53.633 --> 02:44:56.774]  Quote, the woman turned to me and said, unfortunately, you cannot buy it.
[02:44:57.434 --> 02:45:00.435]  Imagine going to a store and not buying food and milk, I replied.
[02:45:00.795 --> 02:45:03.076]  Sweden is a democracy, she replied.
[02:45:03.236 --> 02:45:03.736]  Is it really?
[02:45:04.654 --> 02:45:05.735]  Yes, it's a democracy.
[02:45:05.815 --> 02:45:08.856]  I'll get in with or without a hijab foreclaimed in her piece.
[02:45:09.196 --> 02:45:20.302]  So now in some shops in Sweden, they're literally barring people from entering, preventing them from getting service, from being able to buy products because they're not wearing a hijab.
[02:45:20.762 --> 02:45:23.663]  That's how bad it is in Sweden.
[02:45:24.884 --> 02:45:29.506]  France closes only de-radicalisation centres because it doesn't work.
[02:45:29.966 --> 02:45:31.267]  This is out of Westminster.
[02:45:32.321 --> 02:45:44.886]  The centre, which only opened in February of this year, will be closed after one of its residents was caught attempting to board a flight to Syria, obviously to join ISIS, and another was sentenced to four months in prison for acts of domestic violence.
[02:45:45.946 --> 02:45:46.947]  We're going to go to Alex.
[02:45:47.047 --> 02:45:48.187]  He is live on the air.
[02:45:48.347 --> 02:45:49.608]  Alex, welcome on.
[02:45:50.336 --> 02:45:59.901]  Well, I have really been riveted to the incredible information you and Roger Stone and Tommy Robinson have been covering today.
[02:46:00.441 --> 02:46:12.948]  And so I had to pop in here near the end of your three-hour stint before the fourth-hour host comes up just to point out that if you look at what the globalists are doing, they know the West is inclusive.
[02:46:12.988 --> 02:46:14.669]  They know the West is anti-racist.
[02:46:15.129 --> 02:46:16.730]  They know the West is anti-tribalist.
[02:46:17.748 --> 02:46:43.246]  via our Christian ethos and so they're using that against us to basically conquer us and it's just like Austria and Australia and Germany many different public schools banning pork on the school lunch because it offends Muslims or Sharia law or you gotta wear hijabs or they're now having to put gates up around Oktoberfest all over Germany
[02:46:44.358 --> 02:46:51.482]  Even in Munich and places because the Muslims come in and beat people up and attack people when they see folks outdoors drinking beer.
[02:46:51.963 --> 02:46:53.644]  Or you see a woman walking her dog.
[02:46:53.984 --> 02:46:56.285]  They come over and attack her and say, that is unclean.
[02:46:56.905 --> 02:47:04.230]  I actually had Muslims about 15 years ago when I was walking my dog in a public park come over and they knew who I was.
[02:47:05.370 --> 02:47:11.853]  This is before I really went on the big jag about Islam, and they said, you know, Alex, we like your show, but dogs are unclean.
[02:47:12.253 --> 02:47:13.233]  Why do you have a dog?
[02:47:13.633 --> 02:47:17.475]  So they just can't help but get into everybody's business.
[02:47:17.835 --> 02:47:22.497]  If folks get mad at the occasional street preacher yelling and screaming at you, that's their free speech.
[02:47:22.577 --> 02:47:23.657]  I support street preachers.
[02:47:23.997 --> 02:47:24.718]  Some of them are great.
[02:47:24.778 --> 02:47:26.058]  Some of them are very, very obnoxious.
[02:47:26.418 --> 02:47:30.560]  I think they hurt their cause more than they help it, screaming at you with bad breath that you're going to hell.
[02:47:31.480 --> 02:47:32.241]  That said,
[02:47:33.917 --> 02:47:35.798]  With Islam, it's a thousand times that.
[02:47:35.838 --> 02:47:44.942]  They kill you, they murder you if you don't do what they want, and they ban having dogs, having cats in Islamic countries?
[02:47:46.163 --> 02:47:47.103]  That's the reality.
[02:47:47.443 --> 02:47:49.704]  Communist China is trying to ban having dogs.
[02:47:50.065 --> 02:47:52.706]  Because they want to control every fantasy of your life.
[02:47:53.046 --> 02:47:54.547]  They want you loving the state.
[02:47:55.127 --> 02:47:57.228]  Not your dog, not your husband, not your wife.
[02:47:58.556 --> 02:48:04.661]  It's total authoritarianism, and then we have the left trying to bring in authoritarianism and making us comply with it.
[02:48:04.681 --> 02:48:24.458]  But I just wanted to point out today, when I look at Kim Jong-un firing another missile with high trajectory in the Pacific Ocean, I'm only 4,000 miles from him right now on the westerly-most island, Kauai, of the United States territory, here in the great state of Hawaii, and he's fired another missile threatening to nuke everybody.
[02:48:25.433 --> 02:48:30.138]  Admittedly has nuclear weapons and it just shows us how much danger we're in from authoritarianism.
[02:48:30.558 --> 02:48:32.820]  I can fly to Hawaii for $300.
[02:48:34.662 --> 02:48:43.306]  I can fly from Texas for about $150 to Arizona, and then for $300, if I buy my tickets right, fly to Hawaii.
[02:48:43.626 --> 02:48:46.227]  I can stay in a decent hotel for $200-$300 a night.
[02:48:46.807 --> 02:48:47.768]  I can eat great food.
[02:48:48.068 --> 02:48:59.833]  I can literally experience God's great creation and have thousands of choices, even if I was a blue-collar worker and saved my money for six months.
[02:49:01.326 --> 02:49:09.151]  You compare the medicine, the science, the entertainment, the culture of the West to everything else and it's so dominant.
[02:49:10.552 --> 02:49:11.452]  It makes the head spin.
[02:49:11.772 --> 02:49:15.913]  But it is grandiose, it's decadent, it's sickening at a certain point.
[02:49:15.973 --> 02:49:27.736]  And that's the problem, is that then there's a mental illness that sets in every culture that becomes decadent, like Rome and many other cultures, that we then somehow become cuckold and obsessed with the barbarian.
[02:49:28.376 --> 02:49:37.438]  And we bring the barbarian in, the barbarian incrementally conditions us to put up with their behavior, and soon basically takes over.
[02:49:38.627 --> 02:49:41.034]  And uses our own openness against us.
[02:49:41.094 --> 02:49:45.325]  So it's very important to be thankful for the freedoms we have that have been hard fought for.
[02:49:46.673 --> 02:49:49.634]  And who have politically been fought over as well.
[02:49:49.994 --> 02:50:16.161]  And to really realize that if we're going to celebrate our collective freedom, we have to recognize, as you said, the litmus test of the so-called left with USA Today and Reuters and AP and Atlantic Monthly and the New York Times and Washington Post celebrating the last six months, the jib, as a symbol of feminism and covering up the acid attacks and the murders of people for their sexual preference and women being killed after they're raped.
[02:50:17.222 --> 02:50:21.705]  And the insanity of these lecturing scumbags telling us how to live our lives.
[02:50:21.745 --> 02:50:25.167]  But of course they show Romans as black and say Romans were black.
[02:50:25.627 --> 02:50:29.390]  I mean, listen, again, it's just a war on history.
[02:50:29.590 --> 02:50:31.631]  We're not bashing anybody no matter what color they are.
[02:50:31.971 --> 02:50:35.193]  But it's this thing about if you're white, you don't have a history or culture.
[02:50:35.494 --> 02:50:36.374]  It has to be erased.
[02:50:37.535 --> 02:50:40.517]  The Romans and the Greeks.
[02:50:40.537 --> 02:50:41.858]  We're going to skip this break so we have more time.
[02:50:43.174 --> 02:50:46.957]  The Romans and the Greeks, there wasn't even a racial thing back then.
[02:50:46.977 --> 02:50:48.599]  There was cultural things.
[02:50:49.159 --> 02:50:57.826]  And there were so few Africans in Europe that it was actually, if you read the history books, a novelty and it was actually popular and, you know, blacks weren't looked down upon.
[02:50:58.206 --> 02:51:03.931]  But it was known that groups that founded Greece founded Egypt.
[02:51:04.271 --> 02:51:05.572]  It was in all the history books.
[02:51:05.873 --> 02:51:12.058]  And now they've dug up the oldest mummies and they're all basically Southern European, Eastern European or Greek.
[02:51:13.186 --> 02:51:13.747]  We know this.
[02:51:14.267 --> 02:51:18.992]  We know the historians said the Greeks all had blonde hair, blue eyes, until they got taken over by the Moors.
[02:51:19.853 --> 02:51:27.480]  Most of the Greece islands were captured by Muslims out of North Africa, and that's why Greeks have dark hair and dark eyes today.
[02:51:28.081 --> 02:51:32.985]  If you go into some of the more remote islands, there are Greeks today that look like the Greek statues.
[02:51:33.506 --> 02:51:34.747]  They've got blonde, curly hair.
[02:51:35.167 --> 02:51:36.469]  They were described as having blue eyes.
[02:51:36.889 --> 02:51:46.747]  Again, it doesn't matter to me, it's that you see the extension of the BBC saying, here's what Britons look like, and here's what Romans look like, and it's a black family.
[02:51:47.388 --> 02:51:48.189]  In Roman togas.
[02:51:49.773 --> 02:51:51.214]  This is what is done.
[02:52:07.239 --> 02:52:18.285]  Herman Goering's Luftwaffe bombing them, strafing them for a week until all the British citizens got in their boats basically, came across the English Channel and picked their body up.
[02:52:18.405 --> 02:52:25.549]  Of course there wasn't one black person there because this was 70 years ago before the multiculturalism.
[02:52:26.149 --> 02:52:33.413]  And so now England isn't even for white Britons because it was always black 2,000 years ago in Brittany.
[02:52:34.213 --> 02:52:38.135]  According to what we're all told by the BBC.
[02:52:38.235 --> 02:52:44.237]  Again, this and so USA Today says this is a horrible movie.
[02:52:44.277 --> 02:52:46.878]  There are no black people and there are no women in combat.
[02:52:46.898 --> 02:52:52.701]  And now they have Tour of Duty coming out, World War II game, where it's women.
[02:52:53.521 --> 02:52:58.803]  Well, yes, it's actually true that there were some Russian women conscripted in the Russian military.
[02:52:59.264 --> 02:53:02.145]  And a few of them were on the front lines when it came to the invasion.
[02:53:03.524 --> 02:53:03.564]  of
[02:53:23.780 --> 02:53:47.279]  And so again, it makes everybody like in enmity with each other, where facts and history are like chips or poker chips to be traded around and changed and rearranged by these horrible, drooling control freaks that have gotten us to adopt the language, the culture they want, and now they're down to destroying bedrock basic history.
[02:53:47.780 --> 02:53:49.481]  Now they're down to demolitioning everything.
[02:53:49.521 --> 02:53:52.163]  But again, this modern thing of the last 60 years,
[02:53:53.993 --> 02:53:59.114]  of saying that Egypt wasn't white, and it was black, and it was all taught in all the universities.
[02:54:00.154 --> 02:54:00.874]  It was pushed everywhere.
[02:54:01.094 --> 02:54:03.375]  There was a big fight about that 60 years ago.
[02:54:03.675 --> 02:54:04.935]  People said, don't be racist.
[02:54:05.035 --> 02:54:06.656]  Egypt was founded by sub-Saharans.
[02:54:07.836 --> 02:54:12.297]  And folks said, well, all the historians said that it was founded by people out of Southern Europe.
[02:54:13.337 --> 02:54:17.298]  And that, you know, the same folks that migrated down into the Grecian Islands, basically Macedonians and others.
[02:54:17.818 --> 02:54:20.699]  And they said, no, that's not true.
[02:54:21.439 --> 02:54:22.339]  It was black people.
[02:54:23.615 --> 02:54:33.837]  Well, it's true that if you go into the latter part of Egypt's history, about a thousand years ago, then the population is Arabic and some Sub-Saharan.
[02:54:34.078 --> 02:54:41.879]  But they've now gone into the mummies, DNA testing, and they were as white as the copper-toned girl's butt.
[02:54:42.780 --> 02:54:45.080]  And that's just the reality.
[02:54:45.140 --> 02:54:49.301]  But again, we're not even... It's like saying a man and a woman are a man and a woman.
[02:54:50.121 --> 02:54:51.902]  And if a woman wants to become a man,
[02:54:52.884 --> 02:54:59.571]  And then say she got pregnant and is going to have a baby, and then the Daily Mail has the headline, First Man Has Baby.
[02:55:00.452 --> 02:55:03.755]  And then I knew when I read the headline it was going to be a woman who said she was a man.
[02:55:04.015 --> 02:55:14.146]  And it said, well she was going to have the sex operation, have her genitals, her male genitals cut off, her scrotum, her testes and her penis cut off.
[02:55:17.017 --> 02:55:19.982]  Or vice versa, it was a woman who was going to try to have that attached.
[02:55:20.363 --> 02:55:21.204]  Boy, this gets crazy.
[02:55:21.484 --> 02:55:26.773]  So it's a woman that wants to have it attached, excuse me, added.
[02:55:27.334 --> 02:55:28.556]  Boy, this insanity gets crazy.
[02:55:29.037 --> 02:55:29.338]  And then...
[02:55:30.552 --> 02:55:39.476]  She then gets pregnant, has a baby, and they say a man, even though she hasn't had her new penis created, I mean, you cannot make this up, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:39.716 --> 02:55:51.761]  And I'm sorry to have to discuss topics like this here on air, but you've got a woman that says she's a man, still has female genitals, has a uterus, has ovaries, has a baby, and they say a man has had
[02:55:53.115 --> 02:55:53.575]  A baby.
[02:55:54.076 --> 02:55:55.977]  No, a woman who thought she was a man had a baby.
[02:55:56.217 --> 02:56:00.901]  It's like saying a walrus decided it was a human and then became a jet pilot.
[02:56:01.341 --> 02:56:11.968]  Or it's like saying I identify as a blind person, dump Drano in my eyes, and then make taxpayers pay for me to live on welfare because I identify as a blind person and have a bunch of other mentally ill people say it's okay.
[02:56:12.248 --> 02:56:16.852]  These things are really happening, as you said, Paul, and we have to recognize sanity
[02:56:17.412 --> 02:56:33.017]  Is the most valuable thing out there and that the corporate elite are literally sabotaging society so we don't have a debate about transhumanism, a debate about fission fusion, a debate about quantum mechanics, a debate about all this other stuff that's happening, AI computers, quantum computing.
[02:56:33.874 --> 02:56:43.325]  They want us all running around, not with basic freedoms, but with the new freedoms, to be as mentally ill and as mad as the folks in the Tea Party in Alice in Wonderland.
[02:56:43.545 --> 02:56:46.128]  And then there's all the government documents and university documents.
[02:56:46.428 --> 02:56:47.189]  Back to the 50s.
[02:56:47.409 --> 02:56:48.771]  We're going to make literature ugly.
[02:56:48.971 --> 02:57:03.474]  We're going to make cartoons ugly, we're going to make architecture ugly, we're going to make it cool to be a slave, we're going to make it cool to be a failure, we're going to make it cool to be a slacker, we're going to make it cool to not have kids, we're going to make it cool to be this or that and not be heterosexual to totally sabotage society.
[02:57:03.714 --> 02:57:04.794]  That is a fact!
[02:57:05.094 --> 02:57:16.397]  But then the people that have been caught in this, caught in this miserable system, where they're living in mama's basement, they're baristas, Hillary says, I hate our slug supporters, they're such scum, ah ha ha ha,
[02:57:16.997 --> 02:57:20.098]  You know, Facebook documents admit they hate you, they want to keep you isolated.
[02:57:20.278 --> 02:57:22.158]  Their whole liberal cosmology is mind control.
[02:57:22.379 --> 02:57:29.901]  But they don't care because once they're in it, Paul, they just want to pull everything else down and make everything else miserable because they bought into the trap.
[02:57:30.161 --> 02:57:40.584]  And now, instead of wanting to get out of the trap, they want to control demolition everything else that isn't in the trap, believing that if everything sinks to a low level and there's a giant sucking sound, that somehow they'll be transcended.
[02:57:40.604 --> 02:57:41.304]  Paul Jones is watching.
[02:57:42.744 --> 02:57:43.884]  Oh, it's exactly that, Alex.
[02:57:43.904 --> 02:57:45.685]  Who controls the past controls the future.
[02:57:46.261 --> 02:58:01.916]  It's as ludicrous as saying that you could go to Ethiopia and Nigeria and that this is a typical Ethiopian or Nigerian family and then show a family with blonde hair, blue eyes, white as snow and say that's a typical Nigerian family.
[02:58:02.296 --> 02:58:02.556]  No!
[02:58:02.856 --> 02:58:06.378]  Or to say you're a typical Japanese family of 2,000 years ago.
[02:58:06.538 --> 02:58:08.799]  Just show me and you and go, I'm a woman now.
[02:58:09.079 --> 02:58:09.959]  I now identify as one.
[02:58:09.999 --> 02:58:12.200]  You identify as an Easter Bunny.
[02:58:12.861 --> 02:58:20.624]  And just show an Easter Bunny and say, this is a typical Japanese family, a typical Japanese samurai of 1,400.
[02:58:20.764 --> 02:58:26.306]  And just show a, you know, a Bugs Bunny with a carrot.
[02:58:26.626 --> 02:58:27.607]  That makes sense too, doesn't it, Paul?
[02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:30.461]  Absolutely incredible, Alex.
[02:58:30.561 --> 02:58:31.862]  The revisionism here.
[02:58:31.882 --> 02:58:37.467]  And it's, again, to push the narrative that mass uncontrolled immigration is natural and for everyone to just lie down and accept it.
[02:58:37.487 --> 02:58:37.787]  Stay there.
[02:58:37.827 --> 02:58:39.629]  Do five more minutes and then the next host is coming up.
[02:58:39.649 --> 02:58:40.169]  Don't leave, Paul.
[02:58:40.189 --> 02:58:41.350]  I want you to finish up with that.
[02:58:41.610 --> 02:58:43.472]  Paul Joseph Watson's done an incredible job.
[02:58:43.712 --> 02:58:45.473]  We salute him and the great crew in Austin.
[02:58:45.753 --> 02:58:49.596]  And all you, the audience, the affiliates, and the sponsors, and the good Lord above.
[02:58:49.817 --> 02:58:50.297]  Stay with us.
[02:58:50.677 --> 02:58:51.318]  Two plus two equals four.

[02:59:55.955 --> 03:00:01.861]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.435 --> 03:00:13.436]  You want answers?
[03:00:14.056 --> 03:00:14.937]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:15.137 --> 03:00:17.458]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.639 --> 03:00:23.963]  Alright, final segment with Paul Watson.
[03:00:23.983 --> 03:00:33.029]  You know, when I say Roger Stone's coming up with big breaking news, we have to basically sit on our intel for days before we release it.
[03:00:33.089 --> 03:00:34.770]  And these aren't White House leaks.
[03:00:35.310 --> 03:00:38.392]  These are things that the patriots on the inside want the public to know.
[03:00:38.412 --> 03:00:40.934]  Now, that intensive discussions with Roger
[03:00:43.109 --> 03:00:47.673]  About the fact that we really should hype this up better who our sources are.
[03:00:48.193 --> 03:00:56.720]  I mean, not specifically who our sources are, but that you're really getting stuff that the New York Times, the Washington Post would kill for and that they're not going to be getting anymore.
[03:00:56.740 --> 03:01:09.350]  Because they've been using the fact that they have some people on the inside, Rince Priebus is caught red-handed, to leak stuff to then spin or twist what the info is.
[03:01:10.131 --> 03:01:11.492]  You're getting directly
[03:01:12.526 --> 03:01:13.366]  What's going on?
[03:01:14.627 --> 03:01:21.389]  And, I mean, just like I told you six months ago, Scaramucci couldn't get in to see the President, even though the President wanted him as a top advisor.
[03:01:22.310 --> 03:01:25.551]  And Reince Priebus would walk in and say, well, the President wants you to resign, leave.
[03:01:26.511 --> 03:01:29.392]  And then he called up some certain people and they said, no, it's all bull, wait.
[03:01:29.973 --> 03:01:31.793]  Wait and want to talk to Trump, just don't leave.
[03:01:31.813 --> 03:01:32.894]  You haven't been given a letter.
[03:01:33.254 --> 03:01:35.315]  And then Trump got really mad and said, you're kidding.
[03:01:36.455 --> 03:01:36.955]  You're kidding.
[03:01:39.216 --> 03:01:40.156]  I didn't tell you to be fired.
[03:01:40.416 --> 03:01:41.577]  And so that's why six months later,
[03:01:42.912 --> 03:01:53.417]  Trump wanted him at the top billing as his own group communications director, and Primus came in with a new letter saying he was under Primus, and Trump got really upset.
[03:01:53.517 --> 03:01:58.920]  But again, we'll see how far Roger goes with all this, because I have some other sources as well.
[03:01:59.780 --> 03:02:03.562]  You know, Cernovich has some great sources, but this is high level.
[03:02:04.793 --> 03:02:05.214]  High level.
[03:02:05.354 --> 03:02:10.322]  Just like we told you Trump wasn't going to have boots on the ground to take out Assad and three days later he said that word for word.
[03:02:10.362 --> 03:02:13.287]  I mean, this is coming from high up.
[03:02:14.128 --> 03:02:15.050]  It's important to know.
[03:02:15.891 --> 03:02:18.675]  But it's very humbling too to realize these are just people like us.
[03:02:20.393 --> 03:02:22.954]  I mean, there's not a bunch of Machiavellian stuff going on with Trump.
[03:02:23.014 --> 03:02:26.036]  He's really... The 3D chess is not 3D chess, folks.
[03:02:26.076 --> 03:02:27.116]  He's just trying to do the right thing.
[03:02:27.517 --> 03:02:31.539]  Trying to do common sense, economic things we know work, and cultural things we know work.
[03:02:31.999 --> 03:02:34.660]  He's not doing all the weird scheming that normally goes on.
[03:02:35.401 --> 03:02:37.242]  That's the big secret, is that it isn't 3D chess.
[03:02:37.262 --> 03:02:42.844]  He's going back to common sense stuff that always worked, that was thousands of years of 3D learning.
[03:02:43.525 --> 03:02:46.546]  So it seems super advanced and wild and low.
[03:02:47.026 --> 03:02:48.307]  It's called just having integrity.
[03:02:48.747 --> 03:02:49.808]  Paul Watson, what do you say to that?
[03:02:51.394 --> 03:02:52.735]  No, that's exactly it, Alex.
[03:02:52.795 --> 03:02:57.217]  And, you know, Scaramouche has been put in to root out the leakers.
[03:02:57.257 --> 03:02:58.598]  That's why the media hates him.
[03:02:58.618 --> 03:03:01.879]  Because if he does his job, it's game over for them.
[03:03:02.159 --> 03:03:03.840]  He's cut it off at the source.
[03:03:03.920 --> 03:03:07.642]  That's why they're now leaking on him and trying to bring him down.
[03:03:08.042 --> 03:03:09.523]  But again, that's why they hate him.
[03:03:09.763 --> 03:03:13.605]  Then on the flip side, you've got this huge scandal with the DNC and Wasserman Schultz.
[03:03:14.025 --> 03:03:15.347]  They're blacklisting that.
[03:03:15.387 --> 03:03:16.728]  That is absolutely massive.
[03:03:17.049 --> 03:03:17.850]  Foreign collusion.
[03:03:17.970 --> 03:03:19.752]  Collusion with a terrorist organisation.
[03:03:20.152 --> 03:03:20.553]  Proof.
[03:03:20.953 --> 03:03:22.315]  And they're not talking about that.
[03:03:22.375 --> 03:03:25.599]  That's a collusion story which you actually have evidence for.
[03:03:25.899 --> 03:03:28.062]  They're doing everything they can to bury it, Alex.
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:38.128]  Paul, getting back to the cultural stuff, you were making the point that it's meant to erase history and make it okay to just absolutely get rid of Western culture.
[03:03:38.488 --> 03:03:43.233]  That's the third world invasion, not bring folks in to then assimilate and create a great melting pot.
[03:03:43.273 --> 03:03:50.661]  We all like different cultures, a mix of things, make a lot of diverse food, clothing, literature, you name it.
[03:03:51.718 --> 03:03:53.899]  I like a foreign film as much as anybody or a foreign meal.
[03:03:54.419 --> 03:03:58.200]  But it's meaning get rid of our culture and then let the corporatists manipulate that.
[03:03:59.300 --> 03:04:04.702]  And that's really the issue is destroying Western culture, not just getting us to run up the white flag.
[03:04:04.882 --> 03:04:10.283]  That's why we've got to fight it and say, hey, especially to the so-called minorities, don't you see the manipulation?
[03:04:10.584 --> 03:04:14.325]  They're trying to make sure you don't have a birthright of being in a free, open society.
[03:04:14.385 --> 03:04:15.545]  Why did you try to get here?
[03:04:15.925 --> 03:04:18.506]  And then why are you trying to dynamite it once you get here?
[03:04:20.458 --> 03:04:21.118]  No, that's it, Alex.
[03:04:21.158 --> 03:04:25.081]  The West is the most open, tolerant, non-racist country.
[03:04:25.982 --> 03:04:31.966]  I mean, Britain, absolutely tolerant of everybody, yet we still get demonised as bigoted, as racist.
[03:04:32.246 --> 03:04:37.309]  They're trying to rewrite history to, again, take our birthright away from us, as you said.
[03:04:37.630 --> 03:04:43.654]  Literally saying that women in hijabs are a good depiction of Victorian-era Britain.
[03:04:43.694 --> 03:04:48.457]  They actually said that in a national newspaper, and said that I got owned for saying something else.
[03:04:48.877 --> 03:04:49.958]  Absolutely incredible, Alex.
[03:04:49.978 --> 03:04:50.258]  That's right.
[03:04:50.278 --> 03:04:52.939]  They just say you got owned for being right, for being on target.
[03:04:53.160 --> 03:05:00.324]  Congress saying I got owned for saying there's an attempted coup against the president, which they now admit there is, for being totally on target and first, I'm bad.
[03:05:00.464 --> 03:05:01.044]  Great job, Paul.
[03:05:07.628 --> 03:05:14.952]  Hope the mainstream media feels powerful when you know this is all going on and you do everything you can to lie about what this show broadcasts, what we cover.
[03:05:15.812 --> 03:05:16.733]  The blood of those children.
[03:05:17.853 --> 03:05:19.454]  All over the world held in captivity.
[03:05:19.794 --> 03:05:22.595]  UN caught kidnapping thousands out of Haiti alone.
[03:05:23.616 --> 03:05:24.997]  The blood is on your hands.
[03:05:25.077 --> 03:05:26.717]  Leo Zegami, let me ask you this question.
[03:05:27.298 --> 03:05:35.502]  Who is behind this global sudden wave of thousands of thousands of pedophiles per country being caught?
[03:05:36.022 --> 03:05:37.263]  10,000 plus arrests here.
[03:05:37.603 --> 03:05:44.046]  What is causing this massive move against pedophile rings that even MSM admits may bring down the Catholic Church?
[03:05:44.206 --> 03:05:51.749]  Well, it's happening, and it's happening clearly in front of the whole world with George Pell, but it's also an internal conflict.
[03:05:51.849 --> 03:06:11.037]  A few days before George Pell got booted out of the Vatican, we had basically the police breaking inside the palace of the Holy Office, the ex-Inquisition, now known as the Congregation for the Matters of Faith, basically the headquarters of the most holy office in the Vatican.
[03:06:11.277 --> 03:06:12.978]  The police broke in and found
[03:06:13.038 --> 03:06:13.619]  I think?
[03:06:29.836 --> 03:06:42.465]  is responsible for many decades of secret plan devised by the Vatican to give the less possible money to the victims of pedophilia and manipulate them.
[03:06:42.666 --> 03:06:49.511]  And he was made a member of the C9 group, which is a group of nine cardinals
[03:06:50.451 --> 03:06:58.555]  And three of these cardinals have been heavily criticized for having protected in the past pedophilia, including Cardinal Pell.
[03:06:58.935 --> 03:07:05.298]  So many people were actually astonished of seeing in February 2014 Cardinal Pell arriving in Rome.
[03:07:05.898 --> 03:07:12.880]  And he didn't really hide in front of the media or, you know, in front of the other people in the Vatican.
[03:07:12.920 --> 03:07:27.443]  He started immediately acting with a lavish lifestyle that, of course, brought a lot of criticism towards Pope Francis, who wants to be this very conservative pope who doesn't spend much money.
[03:07:27.503 --> 03:07:32.505]  So this is the first time in history, Alex, that such a high-ranking officer, let's say, or minister of this Vatican
[03:07:58.395 --> 03:08:03.758]  Green lotion.
[03:08:10.781 --> 03:08:13.862]  News.
[03:08:14.402 --> 03:08:15.223]  Analysis.
[03:08:15.743 --> 03:08:16.403]  Reports.
[03:08:17.163 --> 03:08:19.324]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:19.845 --> 03:08:22.646]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:08:29.500 --> 03:08:29.900]  Welcome.
[03:08:31.301 --> 03:08:35.545]  I'm Roger Stone, and you're here on the Alex Jones Show at Infowars.
[03:08:36.766 --> 03:08:39.127]  Big times attempts in Washington, D.C.
[03:08:39.808 --> 03:08:46.053]  as a power struggle clearly ensues inside the Trump administration.
[03:08:47.033 --> 03:08:50.516]  And where the president stands is the crucial question.
[03:08:51.377 --> 03:08:58.322]  We have seen the rise of Anthony Scaramucci, an unabashed Trump loyalist,
[03:08:58.817 --> 03:09:06.979]  We're taking on the mainstream media and taking on the Republican National Committee quizlings who infect the Trump White House.
[03:09:08.339 --> 03:09:21.322]  For reasons that are hard to understand, the nationalist Steve Bannon, formerly associated with Breitbart.com, has aligned himself with the so-called fragmented
[03:09:22.389 --> 03:09:47.600]  Yes, as we revealed exclusively at InfoWars only hours ago, it was Reince Priebus who is responsible for the appointment of Rod Rosenstein, the man who, acting on his own, appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose job is to be an executioner of Donald J. Trump.
[03:09:48.721 --> 03:09:49.461]  Incredibly,
[03:09:50.194 --> 03:10:05.132]  We can report here exclusively at InfoWars that Rosenstein was appointed at the behest of Congressman Elijah Cumming, the African-American left-wing Democrat from Baltimore.
[03:10:05.873 --> 03:10:08.196]  Yes, you heard that correctly.
[03:10:08.925 --> 03:10:20.551]  Pribis took a job recommendation from a left-wing Democrat, and other than Maxine Waters, perhaps the single greatest Trump-aider in the U.S.
[03:10:20.731 --> 03:10:21.092]  House.
[03:10:22.432 --> 03:10:33.458]  Cummings has attacked me personally, repeatedly, claiming falsely that I had some traffic with the Russians in an attempt to affect the 2016 election.
[03:10:36.596 --> 03:10:38.777]  Here is the latest status.
[03:10:40.358 --> 03:10:46.362]  Reince Priebus is the Cato Catelyn of the Trump administration.
[03:10:46.422 --> 03:10:49.484]  He's the house guest who doesn't know when to leave.
[03:10:50.304 --> 03:11:00.890]  And, like Cato Catelyn, he jumped on an airplane to Long Island with the President today in a desperate bid to save his job.
[03:11:02.051 --> 03:11:03.532]  It's abundantly clear
[03:11:04.669 --> 03:11:13.771]  The President has had it with the leadership of Mr. Priebus, and I continue to predict that his days are limited.
[03:11:14.731 --> 03:11:28.074]  But like Kato Kaelin, Priebus doesn't seem to know how to read the tea leaves, doesn't seem to understand the signals he's getting from Donald J. Trump that it's time to leave.
[03:11:29.682 --> 03:11:33.985]  And then there's the question of who will follow Mr. Priebus.
[03:11:34.465 --> 03:11:35.987]  An all-important question.
[03:11:36.587 --> 03:11:39.769]  Because some on this list are problematic.
[03:11:41.170 --> 03:11:57.322]  For example, there is discussion now of, now confirmed at the U.S., pardon me, first reported on InfoWars and now confirmed by the New York Times, that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly
[03:11:57.950 --> 03:12:03.074]  Is on the short list of those who would replace previous.
[03:12:04.695 --> 03:12:22.948]  As we discussed yesterday, ill veteran David Urban, very highly thought of because of the blood and guts effort that he waged in Pennsylvania to carry the crucial Keystone State for Donald Trump, has taken himself out of consideration.
[03:12:24.390 --> 03:12:26.271]  But there are new reports
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:43.631]  That longtime Washington fixture Wayne Berman, an enormously capable individual who has represented Donald Trump and the Trump Organization in the past, may be under consideration for the Chief of Staff position.
[03:12:44.592 --> 03:12:53.337]  Berman, who was a colleague of mine at the firm of Black, Manafort, Stone, and Atwater almost 40 years ago,
[03:12:54.841 --> 03:12:58.263]  Is known as one of the most savvy operators in Washington.
[03:12:58.984 --> 03:13:11.192]  Someone who has deep relationships in the media, deep relationships in the Congress, but a strong and trustful relationship with President Donald Trump.
[03:13:11.693 --> 03:13:12.113]  Roger!
[03:13:12.273 --> 03:13:17.897]  Berman would certainly be superior to any of the other candidates that are currently being named.
[03:13:18.978 --> 03:13:21.579]  Alex, I think that's the lay of the land.
[03:13:21.759 --> 03:13:22.280]  As you know,
[03:13:22.932 --> 03:13:25.013]  Personnel is policy.
[03:13:25.413 --> 03:13:30.656]  That's why the decision on the Chief of Staff coming up shortly is absolutely crucial.
[03:13:31.617 --> 03:13:39.801]  Well, I'm going to be riveted via the InfoWars iPhone free app while I'm here with my family in the next 45 minutes that you have left transmitting here.
[03:13:39.821 --> 03:13:44.804]  46, 47 minutes you have left, but I just had to come in here.
[03:13:45.626 --> 03:13:47.367]  We're going to skip this next break.
[03:13:47.387 --> 03:13:51.229]  We're going to see a little bit more time to bring up obviously the big issue here.
[03:13:51.870 --> 03:13:56.152]  They know now that Trump's going to purge the people that have been leaking, the deep staters.
[03:13:56.893 --> 03:13:59.434]  We know that he now has the lay of the land.
[03:14:00.155 --> 03:14:05.378]  We understand that now even Fox News has intensified their attacks on Trump, their backhanded attacks.
[03:14:05.438 --> 03:14:08.020]  They're desperate and they've now signaled
[03:14:08.979 --> 03:14:28.280]  Going back three weeks ago internally but now publicly that they are preparing to go after Trump physically and the Secret Service has visited the pastor Brown who met with the president also senior members of Congress who discussed the plan to overthrow the president violently he has now confirmed
[03:14:28.760 --> 03:14:33.081]  That indeed his congressional source said the plan is to violently overthrow the president.
[03:14:33.381 --> 03:14:36.962]  Well the Secret Service came to him and demanded his source in Congress.
[03:14:37.002 --> 03:14:38.142]  He said you have to subpoena me.
[03:14:38.663 --> 03:14:42.724]  But why would you do that if you're the Secret Service?
[03:14:43.644 --> 03:14:50.466]  You have globalists on television all over the place saying overthrow the president violently.
[03:14:51.126 --> 03:14:51.586]  You have
[03:14:52.574 --> 03:15:04.061]  The former CIA director with the former head of national intelligence, Brennan and Clapper, on the Aspen Institute TV program, hosted by Wolf Blitzer, saying a physical overthrow is coming outside of impeachment.
[03:15:04.081 --> 03:15:04.921]  We're going to remove him.
[03:15:05.182 --> 03:15:06.963]  You've got Atlantic Monthly calling for it.
[03:15:07.810 --> 03:15:13.853]  You've got it being discussed and shopped around at the Pentagon by former Obama appointees that are high-level.
[03:15:14.513 --> 03:15:29.681]  You've got all this unfolding and then you've got Al Gore going on the Late Late Show two nights ago and saying, don't worry, he's going to be removed in the next few months and a big constitutional crisis is coming and everybody's got to just come together and sit down and take it when it happens.
[03:15:30.041 --> 03:15:31.101]  That's what Brennan's saying.
[03:15:31.442 --> 03:15:34.003]  So the big issue is, what do we do as the American people?
[03:15:35.049 --> 03:15:46.158]  To get the word out about this because they simultaneously have Media Matters, the mouth of Soros, saying I'm crazy and never sourcing anything I said because I was sourcing real clips.
[03:15:46.178 --> 03:15:53.164]  They just show text comments and edited video to make it sound like I'm just out of the blue saying they're planning to overthrow the president.
[03:15:53.444 --> 03:15:55.026]  They've announced plans to overthrow him.
[03:15:55.346 --> 03:15:58.469]  They even have little commenters and bots going, look how insane he is.
[03:15:58.809 --> 03:15:59.750]  No one's saying this.
[03:16:00.631 --> 03:16:02.215]  So that's how crazy they are.
[03:16:02.436 --> 03:16:04.521]  They're all over the place saying kill him, overthrow him.
[03:16:05.002 --> 03:16:08.291]  A top writer, top author's put out a book about how they should kill the president.
[03:16:09.414 --> 03:16:10.475]  This is all out there.
[03:16:11.656 --> 03:16:21.484]  It's a crescendo of drum beating, and then they're moving forward, but when we try to cause a debate about it, as they sell it, normalize it, they say we're insane, it doesn't exist.
[03:16:22.044 --> 03:16:25.127]  So, what do you make of all this, Roger Stone?
[03:16:25.147 --> 03:16:34.575]  I'm going to punch you out and let you take over, because the system is really panicking now, as they realize they can't compromise Trump, and he's already decimated much of their globalist operations.
[03:16:34.615 --> 03:16:36.796]  Back to Roger Stone for InfoWars.com.
[03:16:36.816 --> 03:16:37.337]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:16:40.523 --> 03:16:41.764]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[03:16:42.104 --> 03:16:43.925]  I think you've hit it right on the head.
[03:16:43.945 --> 03:16:51.970]  Here is why you see this hysteria by those who are talking about the removal of the president.
[03:16:52.951 --> 03:17:05.739]  I can report exclusively to InfoWars that the president now understands completely the implications of the FISA renderings at the very end of the Obama administration.
[03:17:06.621 --> 03:17:10.463]  This has been presented to the President as a formal option.
[03:17:10.964 --> 03:17:35.579]  He understands that Clapper, Brennan, Jarrett, Rice, and presumably the President of the United States himself, had knowledge in advance of the willful, unconstitutional, illegal mass surveillance of tens of thousands of Americans, including yours truly, for strictly political purposes.
[03:17:36.551 --> 03:17:41.074]  This is jail time for the front line of the Obama administration.
[03:17:42.055 --> 03:17:44.357]  And they know that they are in jeopardy.
[03:17:44.797 --> 03:17:47.519]  That is what explains this hysteria.
[03:17:48.080 --> 03:18:01.930]  I got a report from a White House staffer only minutes ago that this option has been placed in front of the President and he is mulling it on his way to Long Island for his appearance today.
[03:18:02.702 --> 03:18:15.608]  And I think that explains the absolute hysteria that you're hearing from the alt-left and from those who seek to undo the Trump administration.
[03:18:16.788 --> 03:18:27.513]  Additionally, there is, at this point, appears to be at least a tentative decision to keep Attorney General Jeff Sessions in place.
[03:18:28.393 --> 03:18:34.275]  This is based, of course, on the idea that perhaps Sessions has got the message.
[03:18:35.315 --> 03:18:46.119]  Now, as we know from history, efforts to root out the leakers by the last four presidents have been notably unsuccessful.
[03:18:47.519 --> 03:18:55.002]  The announcement by the Attorney General that he would now pursue a probe into the leakers
[03:18:55.695 --> 03:18:59.017]  Is largely, sadly, a waste of time.
[03:18:59.938 --> 03:19:13.908]  In fact, we know that a far more effective approach against the left would be the indictment of the Obama front line, their national security team, for the aforementioned surveillance.
[03:19:14.448 --> 03:19:23.575]  At the same time, going after Bill and Hillary Clinton and their associates for the thievery at the Clinton Foundation.
[03:19:24.321 --> 03:19:27.685]  That is the double whammy that the left fear.
[03:19:28.306 --> 03:19:33.492]  That is the double whammy that could leave two presidents incarcerated.
[03:19:35.114 --> 03:19:37.036]  That's why the hysteria.
[03:19:37.805 --> 03:19:43.308]  It's very interesting to watch the criminal enterprise that is Media Matters for America.
[03:19:43.888 --> 03:19:54.493]  Researchers that I'm working with can detail the illegal activities and the trafficking of cash in violation of both IRS regulation and federal election law.
[03:19:55.596 --> 03:20:20.435]  And when they began attacking us, as they began two days ago, attacking me over my exposure of the role of John McCain in the Fusion GPS phony Russian dossier dog scandal, which seems to get more and more serious by the moment, we learn every week that
[03:20:21.024 --> 03:20:25.166]  The woman lawyer who met with Don Trump Jr.
[03:20:25.767 --> 03:20:47.479]  was not only allowed into the country despite her obtaining of a visa by the FBI, but we now have photographs of her in John McCain's office and meeting, photographs of her at Hillary Clinton demonstrations, and now tying her directly to Fusion GPS.
[03:20:48.590 --> 03:20:57.032]  The President yesterday tweeted regarding FBI Director McCabe, or I should say, acting FBI Director McCabe.
[03:20:58.032 --> 03:21:12.096]  Not only did McCabe's wife receive $700,000 for a state Senate race, courtesy of Bill and Hillary Clinton, essentially money laundered through Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe,
[03:21:12.901 --> 03:21:38.608]  But more importantly, McCabe authorized the use of $50,000 of our tax dollars for an effort to obtain the phony dossier that was invented by operative Chris Steele in an effort to smear the President, accusing him of sexual improprieties in Moscow many years ago.
[03:21:39.381 --> 03:21:43.323]  A charge that has been completely and totally debunked.
[03:21:44.143 --> 03:21:49.086]  A charge that is fake, but was designed to destroy the President.
[03:21:49.646 --> 03:22:00.131]  When I pointed out John McCain's role in getting the document picked up in Europe and brought to the United States, that got me the vilification of Media Matters.
[03:22:01.292 --> 03:22:07.835]  What these clowns don't understand is that I wear their attacks on me like a badge of honor.
[03:22:08.533 --> 03:22:12.237]  Because they would not be attacking me, but for my effectiveness.
[03:22:13.157 --> 03:22:18.943]  And the reason that they attack InfoWars and they attack you, Alex Jones, is for the same reason.
[03:22:19.523 --> 03:22:21.746]  Because we are the tip of the spear.
[03:22:22.386 --> 03:22:33.637]  We are the ongoing effort to take out the globalists and help Donald Trump assert his agenda for real reform.
[03:22:34.830 --> 03:22:42.472]  This is not a bad time to ask you, once again, to go to the InfoWars.com store and give us the support we need.
[03:22:42.512 --> 03:22:51.154]  You see, we don't have a deep-pocketed George Soros sitting in the background writing big checks to keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:22:52.154 --> 03:22:59.796]  We don't have super multinational corporations financing our operations here at InfoWars.com.
[03:23:00.979 --> 03:23:08.641]  We only have you, the American people, and we must count on you to go to the store and give us the support we need.
[03:23:08.721 --> 03:23:15.882]  It's a win-win, because there is no product that you can buy at InfoWars.com that will disappoint you.
[03:23:16.722 --> 03:23:21.803]  The Super Blue toothpaste is a favorite of mine and those in the Stone family.
[03:23:21.823 --> 03:23:28.825]  If you've ever seen my wife Nydia, you know she has a gleaming white smile, and she attributes it
[03:23:29.574 --> 03:23:31.055]  To the Super Blue Toothpaste.
[03:23:31.875 --> 03:23:36.196]  She believes, and she's used all the products you can find in a drugstore.
[03:23:36.777 --> 03:23:49.902]  She believes between that and the entire line of oral care products available at the store, that she has found the very best dental product that you can find.
[03:23:50.562 --> 03:23:58.945]  And when you buy, you're not only getting the very best, with literally thousands of testimonials from satisfied customers.
[03:23:59.741 --> 03:24:03.103]  But you're also helping finance the fight for freedom.
[03:24:03.783 --> 03:24:06.145]  Financing the fight for a free PrEP.
[03:24:06.725 --> 03:24:09.346]  Financing the fight for the First Amendment.
[03:24:09.787 --> 03:24:11.968]  So Fred, please, take a moment.
[03:24:12.488 --> 03:24:20.432]  Go to the store here at Infowars.com and support us with any one of the selection of the fine products here.
[03:24:21.013 --> 03:24:26.976]  And if you're not interested in our herbs or our other all-natural formulas or our toothpaste,
[03:24:27.614 --> 03:24:39.182]  Well, you can help by grabbing a t-shirt, for example, the Trump-Pence 2020 t-shirts or the Hillary for Prison 2017 t-shirts.
[03:24:39.763 --> 03:24:50.070]  That's where you will find that you will wear these and meet other like-minded patriots who share our views.
[03:24:51.184 --> 03:24:55.947]  One of my all-time favorites, the CNN is big news t-shirt.
[03:24:56.007 --> 03:25:02.170]  I'm going to be wearing this one at Politicon this weekend in Pasadena, California.
[03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:16.677]  So you can get one of these and you're not only supporting the revolution, you're not only supporting the fight for reform, but you're helping us here at InfoWars.com.
[03:25:16.697 --> 03:25:17.698]  Now you're looking at the
[03:25:18.433 --> 03:25:21.574]  Famous, iconic Bill Clinton rape t-shirt.
[03:25:22.354 --> 03:25:25.455]  This is the shirt that Alex Jones put in the history book.
[03:25:26.275 --> 03:25:43.640]  I designed it and then Alex Jones sponsored a contest here at InfoWars that allowed us to break through the mainstream media blackout of the story of Bill Clinton and his serial sexual assaults against multiple women.
[03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:50.412]  You see, the mainstream media wanted to call this infidelities or indiscretion.
[03:25:51.212 --> 03:25:54.354]  But the American people know better.
[03:25:55.034 --> 03:26:10.741]  So, please, go to the store, grab the product of your choice, knowing that you're going to help not only the fight for freedom, but also help us not only get yourself a great product, but help us stay alive
[03:26:11.365 --> 03:26:14.006]  Because we are under attack every day.
[03:26:14.606 --> 03:26:19.508]  Not just from the clowns at Media Matters for America, but from the tech lab.
[03:26:20.068 --> 03:26:23.649]  From Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[03:26:24.190 --> 03:26:28.451]  Believe me, they would seek to limit our ability to reach you.
[03:26:29.331 --> 03:26:35.514]  And they do it every day, through the manipulation of algorithms and a hundred other computer tricks.
[03:26:36.034 --> 03:26:39.095]  They're designed to stop the Trump revolution.
[03:26:40.259 --> 03:26:49.824]  They know that it is only through a robust and vibrant alternative media that our revolution can succeed.
[03:26:50.544 --> 03:26:55.967]  And that's why they seek to block us with a thousand different computer tricks.
[03:26:56.847 --> 03:26:58.268]  How can you circumvent this?
[03:26:58.728 --> 03:27:00.149]  There are two important ways.
[03:27:00.889 --> 03:27:08.913]  If you have a Twitter feed, if you have a Facebook feed, if you're at Snapchat or Instagram, you are an army of one.
[03:27:09.833 --> 03:27:30.358]  When you see a compelling story you like on InfoLog, or Breitbart, or The Daily Caller, or Town Hall, or any other number of liberty-oriented sites, take that link and retweet it, repost it, send it to your friends, send it to your family, and ask them to do the same.
[03:27:31.078 --> 03:27:43.226]  This is how one individual can step up in the fight for liberty and help us defeat those who simply now fall back on censorship as their strategy.
[03:27:45.668 --> 03:27:48.170]  This is not an inexpensive fight, folks.
[03:27:48.850 --> 03:27:54.094]  We are hoping to have extraordinary expansion here at Infowars.com.
[03:27:54.894 --> 03:27:58.637]  I myself have agreed to go to five days a week with Alex Jones.
[03:27:59.217 --> 03:28:00.278]  An hour at least.
[03:28:00.971 --> 03:28:06.574]  I'm telling you the latest developments from the Trump White House and what's going on in Washington.
[03:28:07.875 --> 03:28:09.495]  You're not going to hear this at POP.
[03:28:10.296 --> 03:28:14.878]  You're not going to get it at any place else other than InfoWars.
[03:28:15.578 --> 03:28:17.980]  And that's why we need your support.
[03:28:18.660 --> 03:28:19.981]  Building new studios.
[03:28:20.641 --> 03:28:22.362]  Bringing on new technology.
[03:28:22.982 --> 03:28:24.463]  Hiring new people.
[03:28:25.063 --> 03:28:26.384]  This all costs money.
[03:28:27.065 --> 03:28:34.267]  But it's worth it because the expansion of InfoWars.com is the way we win the revolution.
[03:28:34.647 --> 03:28:36.687]  The way we save America.
[03:28:37.467 --> 03:28:38.407]  We need your support.
[03:28:39.108 --> 03:28:42.148]  I can't say it more strongly or more emphatically.
[03:28:42.668 --> 03:28:44.229]  Please, folks, go to the store.
[03:28:44.329 --> 03:28:45.649]  Find the products you like.
[03:28:46.069 --> 03:28:49.650]  We've got some sales on right now that are truly extraordinary.
[03:28:50.370 --> 03:28:52.050]  Help us help you.
[03:28:52.611 --> 03:28:54.371]  Help us help America.
[03:28:54.921 --> 03:28:58.884]  Help us stand tall in the fight against the globalists.
[03:28:59.705 --> 03:29:02.947]  I'm Roger Stone and I'm proud to be with you here at InfoWars.
[03:29:03.568 --> 03:29:06.590]  I'm excited about going to five days a week.
[03:29:07.270 --> 03:29:13.135]  I'm going to be bringing you the very best breaking news out of Washington and the Trump administration.
[03:29:13.715 --> 03:29:19.980]  I think people know we have sources that are better than any other alternative outlet.
[03:29:20.580 --> 03:29:22.522]  I'm Roger Stone and we'll be right back.
[03:29:26.590 --> 03:29:40.818]  I am also going to report to you on the very latest on the Bundy trial going on in Nevada, where we, last week, were among the first to call for a pardon for the Bundy ranchers and their supporters.
[03:29:41.861 --> 03:29:46.206]  The latest actions by the federal judge there will curl your ears.
[03:29:46.786 --> 03:29:56.457]  It's a complete denial of due process and an attempt to crush the spirit of those brave Americans who stood up against the Bureau of Land Management.
[03:29:56.477 --> 03:29:59.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[03:31:07.081 --> 03:31:13.126]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[03:31:13.366 --> 03:31:16.328]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:31:16.728 --> 03:31:19.731]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:31:19.931 --> 03:31:23.373]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[03:31:23.713 --> 03:31:24.174]  The left
[03:31:24.514 --> 03:31:25.434]  ...controls culture.
[03:31:25.474 --> 03:31:26.455]  They control art.
[03:31:26.515 --> 03:31:27.755]  They control entertainment.
[03:31:28.035 --> 03:31:35.117]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:31:35.177 --> 03:31:37.577]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[03:31:38.077 --> 03:31:41.918]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[03:31:41.978 --> 03:31:44.039]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[03:31:44.679 --> 03:31:50.066]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[03:31:50.306 --> 03:31:56.573]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[03:31:56.634 --> 03:31:58.336]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[03:31:58.496 --> 03:31:59.677]  It's available right now.

[03:33:14.522 --> 03:33:17.403]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:23.524 --> 03:33:24.164]  Welcome back.
[03:33:24.345 --> 03:33:29.286]  I'm Roger Stone here at theinfowars.com and the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:29.326 --> 03:33:30.746]  Delighted to be with you.
[03:33:31.946 --> 03:33:34.687]  As I indicated in the last segment,
[03:33:35.620 --> 03:33:44.764]  Incredible developments in the trial of the Bundy ranchers and their supporters in Nevada.
[03:33:45.764 --> 03:34:05.312]  Judge Gloria Navarro, an appointee of Senator Harry Reid, has now barred the jury from hearing the audio tape of the transmissions between the Bureau of Land Management and their sharpshooters.
[03:34:06.007 --> 03:34:12.071]  Where they were specifically told, shoot to kill and ask questions later.
[03:34:13.091 --> 03:34:23.518]  This precipitated snipers focusing on the Bundy children and the release of police dogs against members of the Bundy family.
[03:34:24.658 --> 03:34:35.785]  For those of you who are unfamiliar with what has transpired, the Bundy ranchers were the last family of ranchers farming, or I should say ranching,
[03:34:36.667 --> 03:34:38.848]  In Clark County, Nevada.
[03:34:40.028 --> 03:34:53.031]  And when they fell behind in their payments to the Bureau of Land Management, the government launched a Waco-like assault on the Bundy compound.
[03:34:54.072 --> 03:35:02.854]  And when other ranchers from across the West gathered in support of the Bundy, they were arrested
[03:35:03.430 --> 03:35:09.175]  Where they have now been denied either their First or Second Amendment rights.
[03:35:10.376 --> 03:35:23.226]  What's outrageous is the attempt by the government, and specifically by Judge Navarro, to deny the Bundys any legal defense.
[03:35:24.187 --> 03:35:27.610]  They're not allowed to argue their First Amendment rights.
[03:35:28.223 --> 03:35:32.467]  They're not allowed to argue their Second Amendment rights.
[03:35:32.847 --> 03:35:36.910]  They're not allowed to argue their right to free assembly.
[03:35:37.711 --> 03:35:39.813]  What is happening here is a disgrace.
[03:35:40.694 --> 03:35:54.806]  Let's cut to my speech in Nevada last week, where I called on the President to review this case and to pardon the Bundy in the name of justice and mercy.
[03:35:55.626 --> 03:35:56.347]  Let's see the video.
[03:35:58.110 --> 03:36:04.392]  I have known Donald Trump, the President of the United States, for 40 years.
[03:36:06.933 --> 03:36:08.773]  He is a just man.
[03:36:09.353 --> 03:36:11.034]  He is a decent man.
[03:36:11.414 --> 03:36:13.375]  He is an honest man.
[03:36:13.715 --> 03:36:15.675]  He is a compassionate man.
[03:36:16.035 --> 03:36:18.296]  He is a believer in the U.S.
[03:36:18.356 --> 03:36:19.296]  Constitution.
[03:36:19.637 --> 03:36:27.399]  He answers only to the American people, not to the two-party duopoly that has run this country into the ground.
[03:36:34.915 --> 03:36:48.168]  And therefore, I appeal to the president, review this case in the name of justice, in the name of mercy, in the name of fairness.
[03:36:48.648 --> 03:36:54.214]  Harden every member of the Bundy family and their supporters and do it now.
[03:36:57.253 --> 03:37:10.985]  We will be posting a petition at InfoWars.com and at StoneColdTruth.com to the President, urging him to review this case, and in the act of mercy and justice, pardon these patriots.
[03:37:11.806 --> 03:37:13.408]  Let's be clear.
[03:37:15.597 --> 03:37:17.360]  We will not be silenced.
[03:37:17.761 --> 03:37:19.603]  We will not be intimidated.
[03:37:19.904 --> 03:37:21.927]  We will not be censored.
[03:37:22.227 --> 03:37:25.912]  We will not go away and we will not shut up.
[03:37:26.814 --> 03:37:29.477]  We are in this fight to the end.
[03:37:32.256 --> 03:37:48.671]  Now, we know that the illegal, unconstitutional, and outrageous actions of Judge Navarro, a vestige on the bench given to us by Harry Reid, the single most corrupt man in American political history,
[03:37:50.675 --> 03:37:59.921]  Who as a casino control commission was known as Paper Bag Harry because if you gave him cash in a brown paper bag you could get whatever you wanted.
[03:38:00.261 --> 03:38:07.606]  This piece of human experiment posing as a human being is a disgrace to his state and his country.
[03:38:19.065 --> 03:38:19.825]  There you have it.
[03:38:20.145 --> 03:38:31.508]  It was my high privilege and honor to meet with members of the Bundy family, the wives, the daughters, the sisters who are not incarcerated.
[03:38:32.428 --> 03:38:35.108]  These are brave Americans, folks.
[03:38:35.628 --> 03:38:40.329]  The federal government is attempting to destroy them and their families.
[03:38:41.089 --> 03:38:42.770]  So please do several things.
[03:38:43.010 --> 03:38:47.031]  One, pray for the Bundys and their supporters.
[03:38:47.851 --> 03:38:48.691]  Secondarily,
[03:38:49.309 --> 03:38:56.033]  The White House phone number is 202-456-1414.
[03:38:56.573 --> 03:38:59.295]  That's 202-456-1414.
[03:38:59.595 --> 03:39:03.657]  Call the White House switchboard.
[03:39:04.238 --> 03:39:09.361]  There is a specific place where you are allowed to leave a message for the President.
[03:39:10.501 --> 03:39:18.466]  Call on the President as a man of justice, as a man of mercy, as a man of decency.
[03:39:19.238 --> 03:39:21.499]  As a man who believes in the U.S.
[03:39:21.579 --> 03:39:34.022]  Constitution, to pardon the Bundy and their supporters, and very specifically, to pardon Pete Santilli, who is a journalist
[03:39:39.372 --> 03:39:55.195]  Who has been incarcerated with the Bundy Ranchers and their supporters for the simple act of asking tough questions about the actions of the Bureau of Land Management and an out-of-control federal bureaucracy.
[03:39:56.896 --> 03:40:00.056]  There is no greater fight in America today.
[03:40:00.917 --> 03:40:03.937]  And our President must do the right thing.
[03:40:05.337 --> 03:40:07.658]  Very disappointed in the
[03:40:08.237 --> 03:40:09.438]  Sequence of events.
[03:40:10.699 --> 03:40:15.162]  I know many people are unhappy with Attorney General Jeff Session.
[03:40:16.463 --> 03:40:26.971]  But only weeks ago, the Attorney General visited Nevada, where he gave an interview in which he praised the prosecution in the Bundy case.
[03:40:28.332 --> 03:40:37.238]  For any member of the bar, for any officer of the court, you would know that this is inappropriate.
[03:40:38.462 --> 03:41:00.118]  For the highest law enforcement official in the United States, who give an opinion like that while the trial is ongoing, can take the outcome of the trial and can destroy any chance that the Bundys have of a fair trial under our constitutional system.
[03:41:01.139 --> 03:41:03.480]  Please folks, pick up the phone.
[03:41:04.281 --> 03:41:05.442]  Call the White House.
[03:41:06.102 --> 03:41:08.304]  Let the President know where you stand.
[03:41:09.065 --> 03:41:13.348]  Appeal to him on the basis of justice and mercy.
[03:41:15.369 --> 03:41:15.990]  Many thanks.
[03:41:16.570 --> 03:41:20.693]  Now, let's take up the question of Attorney General Sessions.
[03:41:22.074 --> 03:41:37.664]  It's interesting that those in the media who were aghast at Jeff Sessions' appointment, who were praising the selection of Rod Rosenstein, the Bush-Clinton quizling,
[03:41:38.154 --> 03:41:47.977]  ...who appointed Robert Mueller as an executioner of our president, are now, unbelievably, praising Jeff Sessions.
[03:41:47.997 --> 03:41:52.938]  Has Attorney General Sessions been compromised?
[03:41:54.099 --> 03:42:06.342]  Why has he not proceeded against the Obama front line of his NSA team, who were deeply involved in the surveillance of tens of thousands of Americans?
[03:42:07.500 --> 03:42:09.761]  It's not Alex Jones making this claim.
[03:42:10.701 --> 03:42:11.902]  It's not Roger Stone.
[03:42:12.682 --> 03:42:14.422]  It's not Infowars.com.
[03:42:15.463 --> 03:42:16.223]  It's the U.S.
[03:42:16.403 --> 03:42:17.183]  FISA Court.
[03:42:18.364 --> 03:42:36.390]  There is no doubt whatsoever about the legal culpability of Susan Rice and CIA Director John Brennan and Admiral Roger and Valerie Jarrett and yes, Barack Obama himself
[03:42:37.242 --> 03:42:45.085]  In this wholesale wiretapping, as it were, of Republicans for solely political purposes.
[03:42:46.226 --> 03:42:49.227]  Now, I am a veteran of the Watergate days.
[03:42:50.027 --> 03:42:57.230]  I was working for Richard Nixon when he was brought down by two egregious mistakes.
[03:42:58.391 --> 03:43:01.852]  One was an attempt to find the leakers.
[03:43:02.752 --> 03:43:03.913]  Does this sound familiar?
[03:43:04.827 --> 03:43:14.673]  You see, Jeff Sessions launching new probes to find the leakers, as egregious as those leaks may be, is a waste of time.
[03:43:15.814 --> 03:43:18.175]  The leakers will never be found.
[03:43:18.336 --> 03:43:30.303]  If you want to root out the leakers, then get the Obama holdovers in various federal departments who remain in place under President Trump out of office.
[03:43:31.144 --> 03:43:33.085]  That's how you plug the leaks.
[03:43:34.133 --> 03:43:51.705]  But one inalterably happened is in our frustration to find the leakers, we resort to the same kind of surveillance and wiretapping that we're trying to uncover and prosecute.
[03:43:52.505 --> 03:43:56.128]  In short, we become as bad as day on.
[03:43:57.108 --> 03:43:59.910]  That is not the proper response.
[03:44:02.212 --> 03:44:03.933]  So what will happen now?
[03:44:05.143 --> 03:44:15.192]  I am told from my White House sources only moments ago that the President believes he has sent enough signals to Jeff Sessions about what he wants done.
[03:44:15.973 --> 03:44:17.814]  He's waiting for action.
[03:44:18.976 --> 03:44:28.304]  He's waiting to see whether Sessions will initiate prosecutions against the entire Obama Frontline NSA crowd.
[03:44:28.903 --> 03:44:31.808]  As well as Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[03:44:32.368 --> 03:44:41.382]  And yes, he wants Jeff Sessions to look into the Fusion GPS setup of Donald Trump Jr.
[03:44:42.584 --> 03:44:44.306]  Why did they target Donald Trump Jr.? ?
[03:44:45.279 --> 03:44:49.862]  Because he is an unabashed fan of InfoWars.com.
[03:44:49.962 --> 03:44:57.466]  Because he is unafraid to retweet and repost some of the most revealing stories that you see here at InfoWars.
[03:44:58.027 --> 03:45:03.410]  Because he is a patriot who supports his father and isn't afraid of a fight.
[03:45:04.090 --> 03:45:06.272]  That's why he has been targeted.
[03:45:07.012 --> 03:45:08.213]  Let's be very clear.
[03:45:08.233 --> 03:45:11.335]  It doesn't matter whether Donald Trump Jr.
[03:45:11.355 --> 03:45:13.636]  met with one Russian or 100 Russians.
[03:45:15.734 --> 03:45:19.656]  None of those meetings are illegal or improper.
[03:45:20.976 --> 03:45:45.466]  In a presidential campaign, and I've been in ten of them, from Richard Nixon to three campaigns for Governor and then President Ronald Reagan, to that great American patriot, Senator Bob Dole, who campaigned hard for the Trump-Pence ticket, despite the fact that he's in his 90s, or whether it was the campaign of Donald Trump,
[03:45:46.590 --> 03:46:02.341]  When someone comes to you and says they had documented proof of illicit activities by your opponent, if you did not pursue that to determine whether it was true, you would be guilty of malpractice.
[03:46:03.402 --> 03:46:07.325]  You would be guilty of undermining your own campaign.
[03:46:08.285 --> 03:46:09.466]  I stress this again.
[03:46:09.486 --> 03:46:11.288]  Donald Trump Jr.
[03:46:11.368 --> 03:46:13.869]  has done nothing whatsoever wrong.
[03:46:15.305 --> 03:46:17.565]  Yet the media act like he robbed a bank.
[03:46:18.826 --> 03:46:22.146]  And the media act like there is something illegal.
[03:46:23.027 --> 03:46:34.249]  You'll notice that in the last several days, the entire Russian collusion delusion has disappeared from the mainstream media.
[03:46:35.289 --> 03:46:44.751]  Now suddenly all they want to talk about is Andrew Dice Scaramucci, as I call him, and the fact that he is an outspoken
[03:46:45.601 --> 03:46:49.183]  A New Yorker who calls it the way he sees it.
[03:46:50.123 --> 03:46:56.406]  And that Scaramucci is sick of the leaking by those around the President.
[03:46:57.606 --> 03:47:07.630]  Now, I can tell you folks, in American politics, the highest privilege and honor you can have is working for the President of the United States.
[03:47:08.991 --> 03:47:11.632]  A White House job is the epitome
[03:47:12.225 --> 03:47:18.546]  of success for those who consider themselves professional political operatives.
[03:47:19.867 --> 03:47:20.727]  And what happens?
[03:47:21.707 --> 03:47:30.069]  Those that the President bestows this high honor on, this privilege to work in the White House, turn around and leak.
[03:47:30.989 --> 03:47:31.909]  And why do they leak?
[03:47:32.769 --> 03:47:41.171]  Well, in some cases, it's to burnish their own bread, to aggrandize themselves, and to suck up
[03:47:41.803 --> 03:47:51.027]  To elitist, snotty, left-wing reporters in the mainstream media, not realizing that they will simply be used and discarded.
[03:47:52.008 --> 03:47:57.650]  In other cases, they leak to pursue an agenda that is not the President.
[03:47:58.991 --> 03:48:08.595]  So, for example, the leaks leading up to the Paris Climate Conference, where we were told that the President's views were evolving.
[03:48:09.301 --> 03:48:13.223]  That the President was going to Europe to get smart.
[03:48:14.543 --> 03:48:21.106]  That we saw the President moving towards the European view of things.
[03:48:22.146 --> 03:48:29.789]  All designed to lull the President into signing on to the failed Paris Accord.
[03:48:31.530 --> 03:48:37.832]  A perfect example of self-aggrandizing elites for a political agenda.
[03:48:39.099 --> 03:48:51.202]  Now, we are going into, I think, a crucial period in which Reince Priebus' job hangs by a literal thread.
[03:48:52.422 --> 03:49:00.364]  And the President will make a crucial decision in the hours ahead about which way his administration is going to go.
[03:49:01.845 --> 03:49:04.485]  Will he choose a nationalist?
[03:49:04.985 --> 03:49:07.086]  Will he choose someone who is dedicated
[03:49:12.160 --> 03:49:17.401]  My sources tell me the President was amused by the New Yorker story.
[03:49:17.941 --> 03:49:21.762]  He has not held it against Scaramucci in the slightest.
[03:49:22.202 --> 03:49:25.783]  In fact, the President enjoys Anthony Scaramucci's feistiness.
[03:49:26.464 --> 03:49:30.665]  He enjoys the fact that he's a fighter who calls it as he sees it.
[03:49:31.505 --> 03:49:36.786]  I can tell you the President was on the phone with Scaramucci yesterday no less than five times.
[03:49:37.312 --> 03:49:39.013]  Let's talk about the latest development.
[03:49:40.413 --> 03:49:53.338]  I would not, if I were a betting man, be putting my money on Reince Priebus, the Cato Kaelin of the Trump administration, the house guest who doesn't know when it's time to leave.
[03:49:54.299 --> 03:49:58.840]  We are in the final throes of his removal, folks.
[03:49:59.561 --> 03:50:05.523]  But will the president choose Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs official?
[03:50:06.172 --> 03:50:08.573]  Uh, who heads his economic policy.
[03:50:09.093 --> 03:50:16.375]  Or Dina Habib Powell, the globalist bushy inserted in the White House by Ivanka Trump.
[03:50:16.976 --> 03:50:22.157]  Or will he go with a patriot like Wayne Berman or David Urban?
[03:50:22.978 --> 03:50:25.318]  Only the President knows what he will do.
[03:50:26.019 --> 03:50:29.800]  But after 40 years of being a friend of Donald Trump, here's what I know.
[03:50:30.700 --> 03:50:35.762]  When the President has all the information, when he has all the facts,
[03:50:36.383 --> 03:50:46.147]  When he knows the truth of the situation, he almost invulnerably will make, inevitably make, the very best decision.
[03:50:46.948 --> 03:50:53.591]  My faith, my confidence, our future is in the hands of Donald Trump.
[03:50:54.371 --> 03:50:55.852]  I stand with the President.
[03:50:56.672 --> 03:51:00.214]  InfoWars listeners and viewers, don't lose the faith.
[03:51:00.794 --> 03:51:02.435]  We stand with the President.
[03:51:12.085 --> 03:51:12.968]  We need funding.
[03:51:13.008 --> 03:51:14.072]  The enemy's after us.
[03:51:14.152 --> 03:51:14.714]  We got it right.
[03:51:15.796 --> 03:51:22.721]  See, to fund ourselves, I sell really great products at very affordable prices to show you like them, and you use them, and you want to order them more.
[03:51:22.741 --> 03:51:24.582]  See, I don't think like a globalist.
[03:51:24.662 --> 03:51:27.904]  I treat you how I want to be treated, and you treat me like that, and I love you.
[03:51:27.944 --> 03:51:28.545]  You're awesome.
[03:51:28.865 --> 03:51:39.512]  It is such a pleasure that they want to destroy us, and they can't because you support us, and you pray for us, and you spread the articles, and you buy the products, and you just absolutely are committed.
[03:51:40.512 --> 03:51:41.193]  Oh, you're awesome.
[03:51:41.273 --> 03:51:45.476]  It's just unbelievable how we rub at their faces and how our will's stronger than theirs.
[03:51:50.519 --> 03:51:58.525]  Ladies and gentlemen, we had to end the super male vitality, super female vitality of the X2 and the Rainforce because...
[03:52:00.017 --> 03:52:00.717]  They're selling out.
[03:52:01.137 --> 03:52:05.099]  And I don't like to just do discounts so good that we're sold out for a month or two before more comes in.
[03:52:05.299 --> 03:52:06.259]  There's a limited supply left.

[03:53:09.864 --> 03:53:11.726]  They were like $1,000 a few years ago.
[03:53:11.746 --> 03:53:12.466]  They're all getting cheaper.
[03:53:12.727 --> 03:53:14.208]  There's a miniaturization of technology.
[03:53:14.508 --> 03:53:16.710]  But $200 is a great deal.
[03:53:16.730 --> 03:53:19.232]  $149.96, 25% off retail.
[03:53:19.753 --> 03:53:20.553]  Usually we discount to $189.

[03:54:06.021 --> 03:54:07.362]  Yes!
[03:54:07.982 --> 03:54:17.611]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:54:18.111 --> 03:54:19.753]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:54:26.536 --> 03:54:39.942]  Hello, I'm Roger Stone, back on InfoWars and the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:41.022 --> 03:54:55.008]  I can now tell you that my sources in Washington tell me that Reince Priebus will be replaced by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.
[03:54:56.215 --> 03:55:10.399]  Little is known about the views of Mr. Kelly, other than on the narrow question of the war on drugs, in which Mr. Kelly would appear to be on the wrong side.
[03:55:11.380 --> 03:55:24.584]  But you are hearing on InfoWars.com, long before any other major mainstream media outlet, that Kelly will be the next White House Chief of Staff.
[03:55:25.512 --> 03:55:29.534]  Remember, you heard it here at InfoWars first.
[03:55:31.796 --> 03:55:53.449]  I also want you to know that the campaign of Omar Navarro challenging Maxine Waters in a district outside of Los Angeles, a race that was first identified by Owen Scheuer here at InfoWars as one of the most
[03:55:53.991 --> 03:56:14.246]  The most important in the country is hosting a fundraiser on Monday night, July 31st, where I will be appearing with Mr. Navarro, who I believe is one of the most dynamic and exciting young candidates for Congress that I have ever met.
[03:56:15.267 --> 03:56:21.552]  Omar Navarro reminds me of a young, hungry Richard Nixon, and he is going to take down
[03:56:22.170 --> 03:56:29.013]  Maxine Waters in a very difficult fight, an uphill fight in the Democratic District.
[03:56:29.593 --> 03:56:33.255]  But you see, folks, the issue is not left-right.
[03:56:33.915 --> 03:56:43.959]  The issue is not liberal versus conservative or Republican versus Democrat, because Maxine Waters is one of the most corrupt members of the U.S.
[03:56:44.039 --> 03:56:44.539]  Congress.
[03:56:45.060 --> 03:56:50.642]  Maxine Waters used her influence to push the federal government to bail out a bank
[03:56:51.727 --> 03:57:00.674]  But never revealed that she and her husband are shareholders in that bank, or that her husband was on the board of the bank.
[03:57:03.336 --> 03:57:08.520]  Maxine Waters' campaign paid her daughter $600,000.
[03:57:09.881 --> 03:57:11.942]  For what?
[03:57:13.143 --> 03:57:14.985]  This is corruption.
[03:57:15.926 --> 03:57:20.269]  So, folks, come out and support us on
[03:57:21.081 --> 03:57:29.569]  Monday night, the 31st, at the Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes.
[03:57:30.110 --> 03:57:36.235]  Dan Paul for Omar Navarro, the candidate first identified by Owen Shoyer.
[03:57:36.296 --> 03:57:45.364]  And yes, I'm ready to announce that I will be a strategic consultant to his campaign, paid the princely sum of $1.
[03:57:46.926 --> 03:57:57.870]  To help this fine, liberty-oriented young American beat one of the worst, most liberal, most corrupt Trump haters in the United States Congress.
[03:57:58.671 --> 03:58:06.134]  Show up at the Trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.
[03:58:06.874 --> 03:58:07.914]  I'll see you there.
[03:58:08.555 --> 03:58:09.735]  We need your support.
[03:58:10.375 --> 03:58:14.297]  And, folks, go to the InfoWars.com store
[03:58:14.980 --> 03:58:24.946]  Where you can find the InfoWars Life Biome Defense Probiotic at 20% off.
[03:58:25.466 --> 03:58:34.331]  This is an incredible sale that I myself, I'm going to take advantage of as soon as I get off the air and can find my credit card.
[03:58:34.411 --> 03:58:38.433]  Folks, we need your support at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:58:38.913 --> 03:58:39.794]  God bless you.
[03:58:40.234 --> 03:58:43.656]  God bless America and victory or death.
[03:58:45.746 --> 03:58:49.549]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:53.352 --> 03:59:02.119]  After speaking with his military staff, President Trump has banned transgenders from the military, citing disruptions in the service such as structural accommodations and increased costs as the primary reasons.
[03:59:02.239 --> 03:59:08.324]  His decision stems from a long-standing controversy over whether the military should provide insurance for soldiers to transition from one gender to another.
[03:59:08.404 --> 03:59:14.746]  In other news, President Trump also publicly blasted his Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not replacing acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.
[03:59:14.806 --> 03:59:19.668]  It was at the center of controversy after his wife received $700,000 for her political campaign from Hillary Clinton.
[03:59:19.708 --> 03:59:22.228]  McCabe was handling the FBI investigation into Clinton.
[03:59:22.248 --> 03:59:27.010]  The President also blasted Sessions on Tuesday for taking, quote, a very weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes.
[03:59:27.170 --> 03:59:33.432]  So far, Sessions has focused more on ramping up civil asset forfeiture and prosecuting marijuana users than investigating Hillary Clinton.
[03:59:33.452 --> 03:59:36.613]  CNN, however, has launched an investigation into media pioneer Matt Drudge.
[03:59:36.733 --> 03:59:47.615]  The founder of the Drudge Report has been spending a lot of time at the White House, which has forced establishment media to not only acknowledge his influence over Trump, but also his role as the progress meter of the Trump agenda and how the Drudge Report represents middle America.
[03:59:47.716 --> 03:59:50.876]  If Matt Drudge is concerned about the progress Trump is making, so should the president.
[03:59:50.896 --> 03:59:52.917]  This is Kent Daniels with InfoWars.com.
[03:59:55.464 --> 03:59:59.508]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
