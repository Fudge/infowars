[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:06.211]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:10.733]  Government is the problem.
[00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:18.436]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:25.559]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:28.610]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.992]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:00:32.992 --> 00:00:34.153]  Hello me.
[00:00:34.153 --> 00:00:36.275]  Meet the real me.
[00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:37.856]  Thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:37.856 --> 00:00:46.622]  We're live worldwide on this Wednesday the 16th day of August 2017.
[00:00:46.622 --> 00:00:50.685]  We're going to be here for the next four hours and whenever I get really really upset
[00:00:51.716 --> 00:01:00.481]  ...at the globalists involved in such incredible evil, and it gets me a little bit saddened or depressed to see how they're lying, how they're trying to divide us in the name of unity.
[00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:07.446]  When I see how they're trying to kill our economy, when I see how they're trying to deceive us, I then see beautiful, wonderful things happen.
[00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:19.590]  Like Heather Hare, the poor young lady that died in Charlottesville last Saturday, her mother, Susan Brough, and her father at a big memorial service going on right now.
[00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.430]  And we've backed it up.
[00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.031]  It's still happening, but we've backed it up to the beginning of her statements.
[00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:29.913]  We're going to have Heather Hare's father's statements today as well, but they're still live right now.
[00:01:29.913 --> 00:01:36.815]  And then later in the hour, I'm going to play the 20-minute press conference excerpts of it, where the media is such clear enemies.
[00:01:37.907 --> 00:01:42.251]  Of America and our recovery and of unity and just frothing liars.
[00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:46.695]  And Trump's responses are amongst the most epic I've ever seen when he takes on fake news.
[00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:58.426]  But let's go out to break with the first few minutes of just the loving words of Susan Brough, the mother of the young lady who got run over last Saturday in Charlottesville.
[00:01:59.207 --> 00:02:12.454]  In that nightmare situation that tears the heart out of any parent because the fact that only four or five days later she's able to come out and show so much love and humility really, really touched, I know, my heart and your hearts as well.
[00:02:12.454 --> 00:02:22.439]  So here is this amazing level of love calling for unity and not calling for the media to use her for hate and to use her for further division in America.
[00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.420]  Here is part of that statement.
[00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.641]  I don't want this to spread.
[00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:27.762]  I don't want this to die.
[00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:33.361]  This is just the beginning of Heather's legacy.
[00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:37.966]  This is not the end of Heather's legacy.
[00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:44.253]  You need to find in your heart that small spark of accountability.
[00:02:44.253 --> 00:02:47.817]  What is there that I can do to make the world a better place?
[00:02:47.817 --> 00:02:48.978]  What injustice do I see?
[00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:52.522]  And what to turn away?
[00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:54.465]  I don't really want to get involved in that.
[00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:55.726]  I don't want to speak up.
[00:02:55.726 --> 00:02:56.967]  They'll be annoyed with me.
[00:02:56.967 --> 00:02:59.069]  My boss might think less of me.
[00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.871]  I don't care.
[00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:06.637]  You poke that finger at yourself, like Heather would have done, and you make it happen.
[00:03:06.637 --> 00:03:08.780]  You take that extra step.
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.545]  You find a way to make a difference in the world.
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.321]  My child had high school education.
[00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:19.022]  My child was no saint.
[00:03:19.022 --> 00:03:23.424]  She was hard to raise because everything was a negotiation.
[00:03:23.424 --> 00:03:26.105]  Not kidding.
[00:03:29.474 --> 00:03:30.994]  You know what?
[00:03:30.994 --> 00:03:34.736]  She was a firm believer in whatever she believed.
[00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:36.816]  And let's do that.
[00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.917]  Let's find that spark of conviction.
[00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:43.078]  Let's find in ourselves that action.
[00:03:43.078 --> 00:03:44.138]  Let's spread this.
[00:03:44.138 --> 00:03:46.919]  Let's have the uncomfortable dialogue.
[00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.760]  It ain't easy sitting down and saying, well, why are you upset?
[00:03:51.099 --> 00:04:01.068]  It ain't easy sitting down going, yeah, well, I think this way, and I don't agree with you, but I'm going to respectfully listen to what you have to say.
[00:04:01.068 --> 00:04:07.753]  We're not going to sit around and shake hands and go kumbaya, and I'm sorry, it's not all about forgiveness.
[00:04:07.753 --> 00:04:09.415]  I know that that's not a popular trend.
[00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.773]  But the truth is, we are going to have our differences.
[00:04:13.773 --> 00:04:16.055]  We are going to be angry with each other.
[00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:30.688]  But let's channel that anger not into hate, not into violence, not into fear, but let's channel that difference, that anger, into righteous action.
[00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:35.152]  Right now, down the road, there's a blood drive going on in Heather's name.
[00:04:36.738 --> 00:04:42.801]  Right now, there are people who are here willing to listen to one another and talk to one another.
[00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:52.907]  Last night in New England, they had a peaceful rally in Heather's name to have some difficult dialogues.
[00:04:52.907 --> 00:04:56.469]  If you ever want to see... Alright, we're going to come back with more of this after the break.
[00:04:57.574 --> 00:05:03.979]  The bottom line here is the globalists... Why is the parties, why is the mold, why is the yeast taking over?
[00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:04.940]  What is going on?
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.121]  What has changed?
[00:05:06.121 --> 00:05:13.828]  Dr. Group, the new product, MycoZX, supports normal fungal and yeast balanced proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients.
[00:05:13.968 --> 00:05:21.334]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic, and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:23.035]  It's available at infomerestore.com.

[00:05:31.422 --> 00:05:33.404]  I want to get your reviews on here, what you have to say.
[00:05:33.404 --> 00:05:34.865]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:05:34.865 --> 00:05:39.388]  MycoZX, antifungal, uh, antifungus, uh, anti-yeast.
[00:05:39.388 --> 00:05:40.208]  Get it today.

[00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.773]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:05:46.773 --> 00:05:50.115]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[00:05:50.115 --> 00:05:52.437]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:54.339]  Look at the response we're getting.
[00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:55.800]  We're changing the world together.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.820]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.561]  God bless you all.
[00:05:59.304 --> 00:06:03.969]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:15.282]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better news
[00:06:15.282 --> 00:06:15.582]  I think?
[00:06:32.816 --> 00:06:33.496]  We're good.
[00:06:59.994 --> 00:07:05.236]  Protect your skin with SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion by Enric's Essentials.

[00:08:08.794 --> 00:08:13.336]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto Line.
[00:08:13.336 --> 00:08:18.018]  The desert is my brother, my skin is cracked and dry.
[00:08:18.018 --> 00:08:25.721]  I was riding on a cold coast and everything was fine, till we took a shorter road to save some time.
[00:08:27.702 --> 00:08:32.745]  Bandits only fired once, they shot me in the chest.
[00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:38.289]  They may have wounded me, but they'll never get the best of better men.
[00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:42.632]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the 16th day of August 2017.
[00:08:42.632 --> 00:08:44.894]  I'll be riding shotgun with Owen Schroyer.
[00:08:44.894 --> 00:08:48.316]  Today, I'm on the ground in Seattle, Washington.
[00:08:48.316 --> 00:08:51.838]  We'll also have Dr. Steve Pachinik popping in to look at the PSYOP.
[00:08:51.838 --> 00:08:55.941]  He was the former head of PSYOP operations at the State Department and the CIA.
[00:08:55.941 --> 00:08:57.362]  The PSYOP, the media's running.
[00:08:58.082 --> 00:08:59.443]  Off of these race riots.
[00:08:59.443 --> 00:09:11.369]  They're trying to start around the country and the teardown of Historical monuments, which again is just a trigger to get people fighting with each other We're going to be looking at that.
[00:09:11.369 --> 00:09:25.557]  We have an ongoing live event vigil with Heather hair's mother Susan bro, and her father very very powerful the things they're saying will play some clips of that and some live clips, but the big
[00:09:26.542 --> 00:09:30.303]  Elephant in the room, as usual, is Donald Trump.
[00:09:30.303 --> 00:09:33.804]  And boy, what a magnificent elephant he is.
[00:09:33.804 --> 00:09:37.606]  I watched that 20-minute press conference yesterday and I watched it again this morning.
[00:09:37.606 --> 00:09:41.287]  We're going to play basically all of it today.
[00:09:41.287 --> 00:09:46.168]  But I'm going to start about five minutes in when he goes to questions.
[00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:48.369]  And then later we're going to look at what he actually tried to say.
[00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:52.697]  Because the media wants Trump to fail.
[00:09:52.697 --> 00:09:55.599]  Globalists want free market nations to fail.
[00:09:55.599 --> 00:10:01.702]  They want the social context and the social contract of a free market system to fail.
[00:10:01.702 --> 00:10:18.830]  Because globalism and technocracy and all forms of authoritarianism, from crony capitalism, to communism, to socialism, to oligarchies, to you name it, do not work one one millionth as good as a free market system.
[00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:25.036]  We've only achieved maybe 20-30% true free market behavior at the U.S.'
[00:10:24.976 --> 00:10:34.386]  's peak that ended around 100 years ago, where we had 10% growth rates from the time this country founded right through until the Civil War and then on after.
[00:10:34.386 --> 00:10:36.088]  Now they call 3% good.
[00:10:36.088 --> 00:10:38.090]  The globalists pick the winners and losers.
[00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.692]  They want a nation of renters.
[00:10:39.692 --> 00:10:40.713]  They want control.
[00:10:40.713 --> 00:10:41.714]  It's in their white papers.
[00:10:43.223 --> 00:11:01.557]  And here's Trump saying, four trillion stock market, four hundred billion new jobs, a million and a half new jobs, three million more, over a thousand companies moved back, border more secured than ever, pulled you out of unelected TPP, pulled you out of the carbon taxes, got a good Supreme Court justice in, got them off the back of the Second Amendment.
[00:11:02.157 --> 00:11:14.946]  On and on and on and on and on and building, if anything is true affirmative action, they are directing through federal grants and federal tax credits over a hundred factories, large ones.
[00:11:14.946 --> 00:11:21.411]  And the President's put out a list of these on WhiteHouse.gov that are being built in predominantly black areas.
[00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:27.195]  And we're talking starting $20 an hour, other jobs $35, $40, $50 an hour.
[00:11:27.195 --> 00:11:31.198]  And then they're even setting up the skilled centers for the training for the entry level.
[00:11:32.261 --> 00:11:40.363]  So you're going to talk about factories where they are in the neighborhood and where they predominantly hire people out of the neighborhood after they're given the skillset to get in there.
[00:11:40.363 --> 00:11:41.404]  That is empowerment.
[00:11:41.404 --> 00:11:43.084]  That is giving people what they really want.
[00:11:43.084 --> 00:11:53.007]  All the studies show to break the back of what you call classism or tribalism, you always have to have upward mobility and economy and then that unifies the people around prosperity.
[00:11:53.695 --> 00:11:55.295]  The globalists don't want unity.
[00:11:55.295 --> 00:11:56.556]  They want divide and conquer.
[00:11:56.556 --> 00:11:57.976]  That's admitted.
[00:11:57.976 --> 00:11:59.997]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[00:11:59.997 --> 00:12:04.798]  I want to play a few minutes of Heather Hare's mother, Susan Brough, who was just speaking.
[00:12:04.798 --> 00:12:06.179]  She's still speaking live.
[00:12:06.179 --> 00:12:08.279]  We have the streams on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:21.143]  But we're live and we'll play a few minutes of what she said a few minutes ago where she was talking about, you know, my daughter is not a victim because she wanted to go fight, not violently, but fight for what she believed in.
[00:12:22.423 --> 00:12:25.066]  And so her mother is proud of her.
[00:12:25.066 --> 00:12:29.271]  This is really the essence of not being a victim.
[00:12:29.271 --> 00:12:33.996]  The globalists want to use her daughter for division, for ethnic conflict.
[00:12:33.996 --> 00:12:34.957]  The globalists want this.
[00:12:36.109 --> 00:12:41.770]  It's amazing, but you look at Trump's press conference and how he destroyed the fake news.
[00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.211]  It was so powerful.
[00:12:44.211 --> 00:12:46.051]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:12:46.051 --> 00:12:49.011]  They said, why are people leaving the manufacturing board?
[00:12:49.011 --> 00:12:52.432]  Because he can't get Merck and Under Armour to move their factories back.
[00:12:52.432 --> 00:13:02.794]  He put them on the boards, hundreds of groups, to give them good deals and to find out how they're getting screwed by China, India, Mexico and others to be able to have a two-way street to come back.
[00:13:04.281 --> 00:13:04.601]  I don't know.
[00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:33.334]  I mean, that's somebody literally that doesn't have a globalist, elitist, blue-blood attitude of screwing you over and breaking your will as an American by breaking this economy.
[00:13:33.334 --> 00:13:34.934]  That's all coming up.
[00:13:34.934 --> 00:13:38.275]  But first, let's go to a mother who's stronger than I am.
[00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:41.376]  I don't know about four or five days later after this happened to my daughters or my son.
[00:13:41.376 --> 00:13:43.777]  I think this lady's a lot more tough than I am.
[00:13:44.737 --> 00:13:47.378]  And the way she said, we appreciate what President Trump said.
[00:13:47.378 --> 00:13:49.219]  We appreciate him talking about unity.
[00:13:49.219 --> 00:13:53.680]  She said his statement was not insensitive, the first statement or the second or the third.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.522]  She's come out defending Trump because this lady's got a lot of class.
[00:13:58.522 --> 00:14:01.543]  And I want to hear, I haven't heard what the husband said yet or the father.
[00:14:01.543 --> 00:14:03.604]  I've heard it was powerful too, but that's coming up.
[00:14:03.604 --> 00:14:04.504]  Let's play a few minutes of her.
[00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:10.332]  We're going to carry Heather's spark through.
[00:14:10.332 --> 00:14:15.654]  So remember in your heart, if you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.
[00:14:15.654 --> 00:14:22.057]  And I want you to pay attention, find what's wrong, don't ignore it, don't look the other way.
[00:14:22.057 --> 00:14:28.639]  You make a point to look at it and say to yourself, what can I do to make a difference?
[00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:32.521]  And that's how you're going to make my child's death worthwhile.
[00:14:32.521 --> 00:14:36.983]  I'd rather have my child, but by golly, if I got to give her up, we're going to make it count.
[00:14:44.434 --> 00:14:47.517]  And her father, because there's some more we haven't gotten to yet.
[00:14:47.517 --> 00:14:50.120]  And here's the deal, I don't know her daughter, Heather Hare.
[00:14:51.101 --> 00:14:56.362]  But there are a lot of people that go out to these anti-racism rallies who really have seen the KKK.
[00:14:56.362 --> 00:14:58.883]  They really have seen these unsavory groups do stuff.
[00:14:58.883 --> 00:15:08.326]  But they've also seen Hollywood that put out about, what, 150 movies the last three years about this to really make this painful to people that have hearts.
[00:15:08.326 --> 00:15:17.048]  It's like the reports of little kids that see the modern environmental shows where the bunnies are dying, the polar bears are drowned, and then they see a condo being built and they cry.
[00:15:17.828 --> 00:15:22.094]  And I've talked to parents where their six-year-old cries and falls down on their knees.
[00:15:22.094 --> 00:15:28.543]  One of my daughter's friends when they were younger, she said, yeah, no, she cried and said, we're killing the bunnies.
[00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:32.770]  And basically, you know, said, I want to die for the bunnies.
[00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:42.956]  And in Australia, you can Google this, ABC News Australia, that's the Australian broadcasting news, not our ABC, but it's national TV.
[00:15:42.956 --> 00:15:45.017]  It was eight years ago, Paul Watson wrote about it.
[00:15:45.017 --> 00:15:54.103]  They had a video game and a cartoon for kids where you have a carbon footprint and as you live and eat food and live, it chops the heads off of bunnies and puppies and kittens.
[00:15:54.103 --> 00:15:58.666]  And then in the game, though, you commit suicide and win the game and then all the bunnies can live.
[00:15:59.437 --> 00:16:02.639]  And you just quietly go into a little room.
[00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:05.061]  You agree to commit suicide at a euthanasia center.
[00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:06.582]  How sick is that?
[00:16:06.582 --> 00:16:12.086]  Teaching you to kill yourself so David Rockefeller has more power or Lord Rothschild has more power.
[00:16:13.817 --> 00:16:20.943]  They're cutting off your life force and teaching you you're evil so you get out of the way, but not before you're played off against each other.
[00:16:20.943 --> 00:16:23.145]  I'm not saying that happened with Heather Hehir.
[00:16:23.145 --> 00:16:27.548]  She was there, you know, believing she was standing up against something evil.
[00:16:27.548 --> 00:16:29.850]  And there was some evil she was standing up against.
[00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:37.596]  That's what Donald Trump said in his press conference that's coming up at the bottom of the hour that I'm going to analyze live here with Owen Schroer.
[00:16:37.596 --> 00:16:41.299]  He said there were good people on the side of the left.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.401]  And they were good people on the side of the right.
[00:16:43.401 --> 00:16:44.541]  There were reporters.
[00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:46.062]  There were people that are interested in history.
[00:16:46.062 --> 00:16:47.803]  There were people that just came out to see what was happening.
[00:16:47.803 --> 00:16:51.004]  Yeah, our reporters were there and got attacked.
[00:16:51.004 --> 00:16:52.725]  And the police stood down.
[00:16:52.725 --> 00:16:54.546]  And then you had bad groups on both sides.
[00:16:54.546 --> 00:17:00.569]  But it was the group on the left that came in there with clubs and things, beating people against the group that had a permit.
[00:17:00.569 --> 00:17:04.571]  Is it OK to attack a group that has a permit and have it stand down?
[00:17:04.571 --> 00:17:08.113]  I don't care if you're the new Black Panther Party, basically a black KKK group.
[00:17:09.209 --> 00:17:10.310]  You have a right to your rally.
[00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.633]  You have a right to not be attacked.
[00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:15.316]  I don't care if you're an idiot KKK group.
[00:17:15.316 --> 00:17:16.938]  You have a right to your rally.
[00:17:16.938 --> 00:17:21.023]  The media is going to edit that all together and say that I love the KKK or I love this or that.
[00:17:21.023 --> 00:17:23.205]  Because they're liars!
[00:17:23.205 --> 00:17:25.227]  That's why MSNBC and CNN are so hated.
[00:17:26.127 --> 00:17:34.551]  I get up here to show you Washington Post where a Jewish reporter got caught staging attacks on Jewish centers and how Trump was right and how we've caught other Jewish groups doing it.
[00:17:34.551 --> 00:17:36.012]  I'm not bashing Jews when I do that.
[00:17:36.012 --> 00:17:37.473]  George Soros is a Nazi.
[00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:45.997]  He's funding groups to go out and do this to control Jews and get them under his control for his political agendas like attacking other folks and other racial groups and other religious groups.
[00:17:46.257 --> 00:17:47.758]  And then the media says, oh, I'm anti-Semitic.
[00:17:47.758 --> 00:17:48.659]  That's a load of crap.
[00:17:48.659 --> 00:17:51.042]  George Soros is a listed enemy of Israel.
[00:17:51.042 --> 00:17:53.044]  In the WikiLeaks, he wants its overthrow.
[00:17:53.044 --> 00:17:54.105]  I don't.
[00:17:54.105 --> 00:17:55.286]  I'm reporting the truth.
[00:17:55.286 --> 00:18:01.912]  Because they said Trump was anti-Semitic when he said he thought leftists were staging attacks on Jews to say he was anti-Semitic.
[00:18:01.912 --> 00:18:04.435]  How did Trump in his first speech to Congress
[00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:06.349]  I don't know.
[00:18:21.124 --> 00:18:22.165]  Well, it's the same thing.
[00:18:22.165 --> 00:18:31.829]  Oh, somebody's turning over Jewish headstones and putting paint on synagogues and death-threatening them every day with telephone calls.
[00:18:31.829 --> 00:18:33.990]  Your supporters, Trump, say you're sorry.
[00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.291]  Trump says, I am sorry for that.
[00:18:36.291 --> 00:18:40.993]  I like Jews and Israel, but I think leftists are doing this to make it look like I'm anti-Semitic.
[00:18:40.993 --> 00:18:43.314]  Oh, you're saying Jews do false flags.
[00:18:43.314 --> 00:18:48.257]  No, I'm saying leftists do it, who happen to be Jewish, against other Jews to control them.
[00:18:49.073 --> 00:18:51.014]  Absolutely correct, Mr. President.
[00:18:51.014 --> 00:18:53.215]  You were proven correct yet again.
[00:18:53.215 --> 00:19:05.960]  But again, MSNBC and CNN and George Soros, the known Nazi collaborator, working to fund Palestinians to literally stab Jews to death in the streets and in their houses and our media.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:13.684]  Then when a Palestinian kills three Jews in their own house a few weeks ago, it happens every day, every few days, they said on the news, a Palestinian was shot in an apartment.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:27.612]  Doesn't tell you there was pools of blood and three dead Jews, or there's a suicide bombing, and then they, you know, shoot somebody who was with them, and they go, oh, you know, they go, oh, three Israeli police shot somebody.
[00:19:27.612 --> 00:19:30.135]  They don't tell you that the guy had a suicide bomb.
[00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:38.543]  This is how crazy it is where the media and Soros and all this are clearly anti-State of Israel, anti-right-wing State of Israel.
[00:19:39.932 --> 00:19:48.378]  But then, meanwhile, they project on everybody else where we've got to bow down that we're against blacks and we're against women and we're against gays and we're... Well, none of it's even true!
[00:19:48.378 --> 00:19:56.984]  We're against globalism and ending our sovereignty and being poor and being slaves and not having religious freedom and radical, unvetted muzzles being brought in by the millions.
[00:19:56.984 --> 00:19:58.845]  We'll be back with Owen Schroer, President Trump's president.
[00:19:58.845 --> 00:19:59.846]  Maybe not today.
[00:19:59.846 --> 00:20:01.127]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[00:20:01.127 --> 00:20:04.869]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[00:20:04.869 --> 00:20:05.950]  Forget bonkers.
[00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.451]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[00:20:07.771 --> 00:20:09.471]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[00:20:57.717 --> 00:21:13.117]  As most of you already know I am a voracious consumer of news and information and in the last four or five years doing more and more research I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much
[00:21:13.237 --> 00:21:15.399]  Much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:22.025]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:21:22.025 --> 00:21:35.477]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:38.278]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.

[00:22:29.551 --> 00:22:32.653]  Radio remains the most intimate of all forms of media.

[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:06.926]  We are live, my friends!
[00:24:14.344 --> 00:24:22.750]  We had Milo Yiannopoulos in studio a few weeks ago, but we taped an exclusive interview that's the interview that Megyn Kelly should have done.
[00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.032]  We're actually asking a lot of hard questions.
[00:24:25.032 --> 00:24:28.454]  We're going to premiere that here on radio in the third hour.
[00:24:28.454 --> 00:24:35.739]  Owen Schroer is going to be taking your phone calls in the second hour and fourth hour today, and Dr. Steve Pachinik is going to be popping in.
[00:24:35.739 --> 00:24:36.680]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:24:38.152 --> 00:24:39.673]  MSM is not real media.
[00:24:39.673 --> 00:24:46.856]  The very fake news of CNN and of MSNBC, and now Fox to a great extent, is globalist owned.
[00:24:46.856 --> 00:24:49.237]  They're the multinationals taking the country over.
[00:24:49.237 --> 00:24:50.737]  They're the ones exploiting our jobs.
[00:24:50.737 --> 00:24:54.439]  They're the ones that want a consolidated economy, not a growing economy.
[00:24:54.439 --> 00:24:57.380]  They're the ones that tell Africans they can't have cars and air conditioning.
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.621]  But it's okay because Obama's black.
[00:24:59.361 --> 00:25:02.423]  The greatest form of racism is classism.
[00:25:02.423 --> 00:25:08.527]  The greatest form of discrimination is systems that seek to make the general public poor to control them.
[00:25:08.527 --> 00:25:09.748]  It's called feudalism.
[00:25:09.748 --> 00:25:10.649]  It's called serfdom.
[00:25:10.649 --> 00:25:15.472]  It's been the most popular ongoing form of governance in world history.
[00:25:15.472 --> 00:25:23.157]  In fact, it was the only form of governance until about 2,200 years ago in Greece.
[00:25:23.157 --> 00:25:24.698]  And their pure democracy was
[00:25:26.431 --> 00:25:29.113]  A bucket of black rocks, a bucket of white rocks.
[00:25:29.113 --> 00:25:38.680]  And if the ruling class could vote, only men that were landed entitled, they would vote with the rocks on what they were going to do, a straight up vote.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.162]  They also voted routinely to kill people.
[00:25:40.162 --> 00:25:44.865]  So they didn't like what you said, they'd have a vote and throw you off a cliff or make you drink Hemlock.
[00:25:44.865 --> 00:25:47.007]  So these are cold-blooded globalists that are running things.
[00:25:47.007 --> 00:25:49.088]  They're psychopaths, they're sociopaths.
[00:25:49.088 --> 00:25:54.793]  They hate the American system, they hate the largesse of it, the freedom of the Renaissance, the spoiledness of the public.
[00:25:55.745 --> 00:25:56.706]  Maybe we don't deserve it.
[00:25:56.706 --> 00:26:00.632]  Maybe we're not smart enough for what Trump's trying to open the door to.
[00:26:00.632 --> 00:26:01.473]  He didn't invent this.
[00:26:01.473 --> 00:26:02.614]  He's trying to bring it back.
[00:26:02.614 --> 00:26:11.987]  But there are losers in this video coming up in the next segment of his press conference when he's giving you all the evidence of the uphill delivery of victory.
[00:26:13.079 --> 00:26:15.480]  And real economy for the average person.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.861]  And not letting rigged elites have crony capitalism and pick winners.
[00:26:18.861 --> 00:26:25.323]  And the media is just frothing like wild dogs on chains trying to get at the lion that's out there.
[00:26:25.323 --> 00:26:26.523]  And just spewing everything.
[00:26:26.523 --> 00:26:27.584]  And he is so balanced.
[00:26:27.584 --> 00:26:28.864]  He's so accurate.
[00:26:28.864 --> 00:26:30.665]  He's so focused.
[00:26:30.665 --> 00:26:31.685]  He's so confident.
[00:26:33.228 --> 00:26:33.910]  It's incredible.
[00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:38.779]  So you owe it to yourself to see what he actually said versus snippets edited together.
[00:26:38.779 --> 00:26:41.224]  Owen Troyer, you're going to be riding shotgun here today.
[00:26:41.224 --> 00:26:43.108]  Do you concur with my analysis or what's your breakdown?
[00:26:43.823 --> 00:26:48.525]  Well I thought that the press conference yesterday was one of the greatest press conferences I've ever heard.
[00:26:48.525 --> 00:27:04.472]  I think it's beyond pathetic, beyond words, beyond comprehension that we can tune into mainstream media over the course of the 18 hours or whatever it is since that press conference and they still say Trump yet to denounce white supremacy.
[00:27:04.472 --> 00:27:07.714]  Trump yet to denounce, you know, the violence at the rallies.
[00:27:08.354 --> 00:27:12.078]  It's just cold-blooded lies.
[00:27:12.078 --> 00:27:13.860]  Just straight-up lies.
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:23.470]  And what I'm hoping, and it wasn't the case if you tuned in to C-SPAN today, a bunch of callers fell for it, is that America can see through the mainstream media lies.
[00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.152]  You would think this is as basic as it gets.
[00:27:26.215 --> 00:27:26.976]  Oh, and I totally agree.
[00:27:26.976 --> 00:27:28.096]  Here's the problem with C-SPAN.
[00:27:28.096 --> 00:27:29.878]  They now screen the calls.
[00:27:29.878 --> 00:27:31.779]  They ask, do you think he's a racist?
[00:27:31.779 --> 00:27:33.540]  Or do you not think he's a racist?
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.661]  Or are you not sure?
[00:27:34.661 --> 00:27:36.542]  They do Republican, Democrat, Independent.
[00:27:36.542 --> 00:27:39.664]  Or they do think Trump's bad, think Trump's good, not sure.
[00:27:39.664 --> 00:27:43.507]  Okay, so you've got to basically lie on the call screen to get through.
[00:27:43.507 --> 00:27:51.433]  But absolutely, we need to get Darren McBrainer, one of the people now, not tomorrow, not next week, because no one will care then, to show him denounced it on Saturday,
[00:27:52.513 --> 00:28:12.386]  Show him, denounced it on Monday, and then show him again, denounced it on Tuesday, and show him say, I denounce it, I denounce it, I denounce racism, come together, love, love, love, I denounce it, come together, but in between show them going, he won't denounce it, he won't denounce it, he never denounced it, he still hasn't denounced it, and then say, oh, do you remember this?
[00:28:13.206 --> 00:28:19.931]  Do you remember when he said ten years ago, I don't like, you know, David Duke just randomly when somebody brought him up?
[00:28:19.931 --> 00:28:28.076]  Then he said it before, then he said it on the campaign, then in one press conference he said it like four times, and they kept saying three minutes later, you never denounced it.
[00:28:28.076 --> 00:28:31.078]  So we need to show people how they did that.
[00:28:31.078 --> 00:28:33.420]  Oh, and why won't you denounce rape?
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.320]  Why won't I denounce it?
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.602]  Well, we have denounced it, but we didn't do it.
[00:28:36.602 --> 00:28:42.906]  The point is, it's pure dumb-dumb level to put out some moral outrage to really stupid people in the public.
[00:28:43.646 --> 00:28:50.568]  If this is really a stupid person test, consider and feel moral outrage and call in and go, yeah, he never denounced it.
[00:28:50.568 --> 00:28:52.129]  How stupid do they feel?
[00:28:52.129 --> 00:28:56.250]  Or how stupid do these people, I mean, are these the type of folks that buy Powerball lotteries?
[00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:58.371]  And I'm not saying that you buy the lottery for fun, you're bad.
[00:28:58.371 --> 00:29:05.053]  But if it's your business model, if it's your business plan to buy lottery tickets thinking you're going to win, is this the same type of useful idiots Owen?
[00:29:06.252 --> 00:29:07.293]  I assume as much.
[00:29:07.293 --> 00:29:10.416]  I mean, I don't understand the type of... You know what it is, though, Alex?
[00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:13.038]  I think it's that people, they don't know.
[00:29:13.038 --> 00:29:14.479]  They've never heard Trump say anything.
[00:29:14.479 --> 00:29:23.007]  What they do is they walk through the gym, or they walk through the cafe, or they walk through the restaurant, and they just see the television, and on the bottom line it says, Trump yet to denounce.
[00:29:23.007 --> 00:29:26.470]  Or they have a push notification on their cell phone, and it just says, Trump racist.
[00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:27.811]  They don't actually know the context.
[00:29:27.811 --> 00:29:28.792]  They don't know the content.
[00:29:29.739 --> 00:29:30.340]  That's it.
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:30.920]  That's it.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.480]  That's it.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.041]  That's it.
[00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:32.581]  That's it.
[00:29:32.581 --> 00:29:33.181]  That's it.
[00:29:33.181 --> 00:29:34.442]  You just hit it.
[00:29:34.442 --> 00:29:37.845]  So I've been watching it in hotels and in restaurants where I am with their stuff on TV.
[00:29:37.845 --> 00:29:39.986]  It says Trump defends KKK.
[00:29:39.986 --> 00:29:42.248]  Trump refuses to, you know, say no.
[00:29:42.248 --> 00:29:44.049]  Or Michael Moore says he is a Nazi.
[00:29:44.049 --> 00:29:44.749]  He is a racist.
[00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:47.631]  And they just see that or they read it in the newspaper headline.
[00:29:47.631 --> 00:29:49.452]  They're not paying attention and they believe it.
[00:29:49.452 --> 00:29:50.673]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.673 --> 00:29:51.634]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:51.634 --> 00:29:54.336]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.801 --> 00:30:01.202]  Why is the fungus?
[00:30:01.202 --> 00:30:02.283]  Why is the mold?
[00:30:02.283 --> 00:30:04.024]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:30:04.024 --> 00:30:04.985]  What is going on?
[00:30:04.985 --> 00:30:05.745]  What has changed?
[00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:31.481]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[00:30:31.481 --> 00:30:32.502]  I want to get your reviews.
[00:30:32.502 --> 00:30:33.462]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:30:33.462 --> 00:30:34.922]  For me, it's been incredible.

[00:30:46.825 --> 00:30:50.165]  I cannot tell something unless it helps somebody.
[00:30:50.165 --> 00:30:52.486]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[00:30:52.486 --> 00:30:54.386]  Look at the response we're getting.
[00:30:54.386 --> 00:30:55.847]  We're changing the world together.
[00:30:55.847 --> 00:30:56.847]  You are the InfoWar.

[00:31:29.346 --> 00:31:38.089]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.

[00:33:03.843 --> 00:33:05.623]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:05.623 --> 00:33:07.804]  Because there is a war on.
[00:33:07.804 --> 00:33:08.784]  Or you're mine.
[00:33:12.819 --> 00:33:23.881]  Alright, I'm going to skip this next network break coming up because I want to play most of Trump's press conference, at least from the point where he started taking questions.
[00:33:23.881 --> 00:33:39.245]  And then we're going to, later, McGreen did put together a compilation of Trump, six minutes long, disavowing David Duke, the KKK, and then disavowing it again, and again and again with timestamps showing how the media poses and says, why have you never?
[00:33:40.694 --> 00:33:43.775]  You know, months and months and years and years into him disavowing.
[00:33:43.775 --> 00:33:51.736]  And the new stuff where he, where he decried, uh, Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, they don't care.
[00:33:51.736 --> 00:33:54.096]  They keep saying, why won't you disavow?
[00:33:54.096 --> 00:33:55.977]  Why won't you disavow?
[00:33:55.977 --> 00:33:57.577]  Lying to their viewers, lying to you.
[00:33:57.577 --> 00:34:00.518]  And it's just like Owen Schroer said earlier.
[00:34:00.518 --> 00:34:08.599]  This is happening is the average person is just reading notifications on their phones or they're reading Yahoo News at the restaurant or at the store, uh, or they're reading Google.
[00:34:10.145 --> 00:34:14.206]  That's why they hate Drudge, because he could actually take what Trump really said.
[00:34:14.206 --> 00:34:15.167]  Or they hate InfoWars.
[00:34:15.167 --> 00:34:17.548]  We could actually have real quotes, real video.
[00:34:17.548 --> 00:34:19.948]  There's a war against reality.
[00:34:19.948 --> 00:34:22.349]  These people are in a war against reality.
[00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:24.230]  This morning I was in a hotel restaurant.
[00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:27.031]  I was looking at people on their laptops.
[00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:27.971]  And it was headline.
[00:34:27.971 --> 00:34:29.392]  That was on Yahoo News.
[00:34:29.392 --> 00:34:34.894]  Obama, you know, concerned Trump won't decry racism.
[00:34:36.434 --> 00:34:40.155]  I saw other headlines saying the same thing.
[00:34:40.155 --> 00:34:48.297]  And I'd get up to get some more coffee or whatever, and I'd walk by and read what they were reading just to see, and they were just all sitting there, not even reading the actual articles.
[00:34:48.297 --> 00:34:52.078]  Because you read the articles at the bottom, they'll actually say the truth a lot of times.
[00:34:52.078 --> 00:34:56.440]  It's the top, and the first few paragraphs are incredible.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.941]  They're absolutely incredible, the way they deceive you.
[00:34:59.941 --> 00:35:02.581]  But I know as an audience, you understand that.
[00:35:02.581 --> 00:35:04.022]  It's just that it's getting more and more intense.
[00:35:05.572 --> 00:35:07.813]  The number one thing folks can do is understand this.
[00:35:07.813 --> 00:35:09.054]  We're under globalist attack.
[00:35:09.054 --> 00:35:10.175]  They're trying to take our sponsors.
[00:35:10.175 --> 00:35:11.216]  They're trying to shut us down.
[00:35:11.216 --> 00:35:13.617]  But because of you, we're still moving forward.
[00:35:13.617 --> 00:35:21.422]  And I have committed to you to bring you the very best books, films, water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds, you name it.
[00:35:21.422 --> 00:35:22.062]  And we have the
[00:35:23.291 --> 00:35:25.011]  Biggest special in our history.
[00:35:25.011 --> 00:35:28.092]  Last month's special and this month's special combined.
[00:35:28.092 --> 00:35:30.092]  Because folks love specials.
[00:35:30.092 --> 00:35:36.334]  And because BuzzFeed tried to shut us down, sent us to one of these California labs with the highest standards in the world, California standards.
[00:35:36.334 --> 00:35:39.354]  They failed to find any toxins, any metals.
[00:35:39.354 --> 00:35:43.455]  So they lied about us and said, oh look, they should sell their vitamin B12 for less.
[00:35:43.455 --> 00:35:47.636]  But the very same site sells the best vitamin B12 out there from the studies.
[00:35:47.636 --> 00:35:48.996]  They say it's the best.
[00:35:48.996 --> 00:35:50.937]  They didn't know that we private labeled it and had it for $12 less.
[00:35:51.977 --> 00:35:55.620]  So it's just, we show all that on the BuzzFeed special page.
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.963]  Just a devastating victory against these lying failures.
[00:35:58.963 --> 00:35:59.663]  And that's what they are.
[00:35:59.663 --> 00:36:00.584]  They've chosen failure.
[00:36:00.584 --> 00:36:01.785]  They've chosen evil.
[00:36:01.785 --> 00:36:03.086]  They've chosen not to be productive.
[00:36:03.086 --> 00:36:05.688]  They've chosen to serve lies, serve corruption.
[00:36:05.688 --> 00:36:06.529]  That's fine.
[00:36:06.529 --> 00:36:08.430]  They've chosen their Lord and Savior.
[00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.573]  Brain Force Plus, incredible, nootropic, people love it.
[00:36:11.573 --> 00:36:12.874]  Super high-powered.
[00:36:12.874 --> 00:36:13.995]  Very, very good.
[00:36:13.995 --> 00:36:15.996]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen.
[00:36:15.996 --> 00:36:16.317]  They take
[00:36:16.857 --> 00:36:21.280]  You know, all these bad halogens, put them in the food, the water, they fill the thyroid and other glands.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:25.143]  If you don't have the good, clean iodine in there, then the bad ones go in.
[00:36:25.143 --> 00:36:28.906]  If there's a radiation event, you get the bad iodine, the radioactive iodine.
[00:36:28.906 --> 00:36:31.548]  Having the good iodine blocks that.
[00:36:31.548 --> 00:36:36.692]  BuzzFeed lab tested and said, it's not potassium iodide, it's not sodium iodide, it's sold everywhere.
[00:36:36.692 --> 00:36:38.473]  It's just iodine.
[00:36:38.473 --> 00:36:39.554]  So they had to spin each thing.
[00:36:39.554 --> 00:36:45.198]  Yes, you know how hard it is to get the actual pure deep earth type, get the DEA certifications, have it all.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.761]  Because it is a major precursor to a lot of things.
[00:36:48.761 --> 00:36:52.463]  We have that Survival Shield X2, 55% off.
[00:36:52.463 --> 00:36:55.584]  Secret 12, the one they demonized, 55% off.
[00:36:55.584 --> 00:36:57.785]  Bio-True Selenium, it is $17.76.
[00:36:57.785 --> 00:37:02.187]  New Super Blue Mouthwash, 11% off, $17.76.
[00:37:02.187 --> 00:37:05.408]  With Colloidal Silver, and of course, with Iodine.
[00:37:05.408 --> 00:37:05.868]  Amazing.
[00:37:05.868 --> 00:37:06.789]  True Iodine.
[00:37:06.789 --> 00:37:07.469]  We call it true.
[00:37:07.469 --> 00:37:08.349]  It's our term.
[00:37:08.349 --> 00:37:09.270]  Because it's true.
[00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.610]  It's what nascent means.
[00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:11.811]  Everything else calls itself that.
[00:37:11.811 --> 00:37:12.151]  They're not.
[00:37:12.151 --> 00:37:13.952]  They're potassium or other types.
[00:37:15.299 --> 00:37:15.499]  Thank you.
[00:37:37.959 --> 00:37:41.722]  Alexa Pure Breeze, the great air filtration, $149.96.
[00:37:41.722 --> 00:37:45.044]  That's got to end on Friday, they were telling me, because they are running out of those.
[00:37:45.044 --> 00:37:50.147]  Amazing Ion Filter, Carbon Filter, and two other filtration systems in one unit.
[00:37:50.147 --> 00:37:52.308]  Similar units are $400 to $800 still.
[00:37:52.308 --> 00:37:53.329]  Used to be $1,000.
[00:37:53.329 --> 00:37:55.190]  Vitamin Refusion, 33% off.
[00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:57.051]  Knockout Sleep Aid, 50% off.

[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.540]  Cancel any time.

[00:38:15.621 --> 00:38:17.001]  Free shipping also.
[00:38:17.001 --> 00:38:18.802]  Free shipping on all orders.
[00:38:18.802 --> 00:38:19.542]  $50 or more.
[00:38:19.542 --> 00:38:21.023]  It has been your commitment
[00:38:21.503 --> 00:38:25.967]  To get great products, support the Infowar that is breaking the back of the globalists.
[00:38:25.967 --> 00:38:28.309]  These loser scumbags recognize it.
[00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:29.671]  They're hitting us with everything they got.
[00:38:29.671 --> 00:38:30.592]  They're hitting Trump.
[00:38:30.592 --> 00:38:32.153]  But he was so stalwart.
[00:38:32.153 --> 00:38:35.836]  He was so strong up there in the face of all their lies.
[00:38:35.836 --> 00:38:37.138]  I've never seen a lawyer.
[00:38:37.138 --> 00:38:40.020]  I've never seen me in press conferences and I do a good job.
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.783]  I've never seen anybody slice people up.
[00:38:42.783 --> 00:38:43.764]  Not Johnny Cochran.
[00:38:44.793 --> 00:38:46.654]  Not F. Lee Bailey.
[00:38:46.654 --> 00:38:48.634]  Not Barack Obama, who's a great public speaker.
[00:38:48.634 --> 00:38:50.455]  Not Bill Clinton.
[00:38:50.455 --> 00:38:51.876]  Not even Nigel Farage.
[00:38:51.876 --> 00:38:53.376]  And he's about as good as it gets.
[00:38:53.376 --> 00:38:56.497]  He's better than me.
[00:38:56.497 --> 00:39:08.662]  Ladies and gentlemen, he sliced them into mincemeat and devastated them with pure truth, with honor, with balance, with love, with reconciliation, with unity.
[00:39:08.662 --> 00:39:12.403]  And the mother and the father of the poor lady that died, they recognize that.
[00:39:12.403 --> 00:39:13.824]  They're saying, don't use our daughter for this.
[00:39:14.929 --> 00:39:17.271]  She died standing up for what she believed in, but they don't care.
[00:39:17.271 --> 00:39:18.432]  They're still going to use her.
[00:39:18.432 --> 00:39:20.874]  Oh, and I want to start getting to this powerful press conference.
[00:39:20.874 --> 00:39:29.222]  We're going to have to go five minutes to the next hour to get to all of it, but I mean, it's just, I don't want to sit here and just grovel at Trump, but he deserves it.
[00:39:29.222 --> 00:39:31.624]  Uphill battle, enemy coming after his family.
[00:39:31.624 --> 00:39:34.106]  Behind the scenes, I know the preachers he prays with.
[00:39:34.106 --> 00:39:36.108]  He really is getting, in fact,
[00:39:37.947 --> 00:39:39.568]  Gary Haven was going to get into it.
[00:39:39.568 --> 00:39:40.189]  He never got into it.
[00:39:40.189 --> 00:39:48.274]  When he hosts on Thursday, I want him to spend 20 minutes on some of the top preachers in the country that are personal friends with Trump and their private prayer meetings.
[00:39:48.274 --> 00:39:49.115]  Because they said no.
[00:39:49.115 --> 00:39:50.736]  They don't care if it gets out, actually.
[00:39:50.736 --> 00:39:53.478]  What Trump does behind the scenes, he wants it.
[00:39:53.478 --> 00:39:54.098]  He believes it.
[00:39:54.098 --> 00:39:54.719]  He knows it.
[00:39:54.719 --> 00:39:57.701]  And I separately have had private conversations about God with Trump.
[00:39:57.701 --> 00:39:58.621]  I'm not going to get into those.
[00:39:59.722 --> 00:40:04.687]  He's talked about how he was always been a Christian, but was more focused on life, his kids, his family.
[00:40:04.687 --> 00:40:05.528]  He just loved God.
[00:40:05.528 --> 00:40:09.532]  It wasn't like he was a Pharisee having to just say, oh, I'm a Christian and being all fake.
[00:40:09.532 --> 00:40:10.893]  He didn't like those people.
[00:40:10.893 --> 00:40:20.462]  But under the attack of the campaign and what he went through and Christians loving him and laying hands on him and things that happened around the country, he said he never felt any energy like it.
[00:40:20.462 --> 00:40:23.625]  And now he's becoming a super deep Christian.
[00:40:24.346 --> 00:40:27.108]  And who wouldn't under the pressure he's under?
[00:40:27.108 --> 00:40:29.290]  And then delivering on the economy.
[00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:34.473]  Let me tell you something, I've always been a Christian too, but going through the stuff I've been through, it gets you real close to God.
[00:40:34.473 --> 00:40:36.274]  I can feel the Holy Spirit right now.
[00:40:36.274 --> 00:40:37.675]  And Trump can feel it.
[00:40:37.675 --> 00:40:38.876]  And he's addicted.
[00:40:38.876 --> 00:40:43.760]  That's what God gives you when you go through persecution, folks, is you get addicted to the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.600]  It's a good addiction.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.303]  And Trump has got the holy fire of the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:48.303 --> 00:40:49.744]  Well, it's called a fire, folks.
[00:40:49.744 --> 00:40:51.705]  You start burning once you get it.
[00:40:51.705 --> 00:40:52.265]  I mean, you heard
[00:40:53.186 --> 00:40:54.046]  Pastor Brown on.
[00:40:54.046 --> 00:40:56.428]  I think he's coming back on, what, today or tomorrow.
[00:40:56.428 --> 00:40:58.088]  Pastor Brown was on fire.
[00:40:58.088 --> 00:41:00.990]  We were finishing each other's sentences when we were on.
[00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:04.471]  He's an incredible speaker because it's the fire of God.
[00:41:04.471 --> 00:41:20.859]  And we were seeing that in Trump, standing against the hyenas, standing against those that want to make us poor, standing against those that are lying, standing against those that want to enslave us so they can control us and dictate our surrender, standing and razor blade sharp, slicing everything they said to pieces perfectly.
[00:41:21.539 --> 00:41:22.639]  I mean, I'd give him a 99.9.
[00:41:22.639 --> 00:41:30.123]  He barely stumbled for one half second one time as they're screaming at him and hissing and yelling.
[00:41:30.123 --> 00:41:31.623]  I mean, he was just so manly.
[00:41:31.623 --> 00:41:32.744]  It was so strong.
[00:41:32.744 --> 00:41:34.144]  It was so honorable.
[00:41:34.144 --> 00:41:40.207]  It's the opposite of looking at a Michael Moore or a Nancy Pelosi that makes me feel dishonored even looking at him.
[00:41:40.207 --> 00:41:40.707]  Owen Schroer.
[00:41:41.018 --> 00:41:44.741]  Well, it was one of those press conferences for me that I couldn't step away from.
[00:41:44.741 --> 00:41:45.862]  I couldn't turn away from.
[00:41:45.862 --> 00:41:47.163]  I couldn't get my ear off of.
[00:41:47.163 --> 00:41:48.203]  I had to hear the whole thing.
[00:41:48.203 --> 00:41:50.045]  I actually went back and listened to it again.
[00:41:50.045 --> 00:41:51.466]  It was so amazing.
[00:41:51.466 --> 00:42:02.954]  And what he's doing with these press conferences is he's providing an opportunity for people who actually want to get involved, people who actually want to be involved with taking this country back.
[00:42:02.954 --> 00:42:04.816]  He's giving them the opportunity to say, hey, look,
[00:42:05.609 --> 00:42:16.612]  I'm not perfect, I'm not going to be agreeing with you on everything, but we're going to make America first, we're going to come together as Americans, and anybody who wants to be informed knows this, so they're going to get on board and this is going to happen.
[00:42:16.612 --> 00:42:28.155]  The problem is, we have LARPers out there, and we have people who just read the push notifications, who don't know anything, they don't know what's going on, you look at the video you covered where they take down the statue in North Carolina, and then what are these people doing?
[00:42:28.775 --> 00:42:30.136]  They're kicking the statue.
[00:42:30.136 --> 00:42:31.358]  They're spitting on the statue.
[00:42:31.358 --> 00:42:32.479]  They're punching the statue.
[00:42:32.479 --> 00:42:33.500]  Flicking it off.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.381]  An inanimate object.
[00:42:35.381 --> 00:42:35.882]  Okay?
[00:42:35.882 --> 00:42:37.624]  They've never been slaves.
[00:42:37.624 --> 00:42:39.666]  They've never seen slavery in America.
[00:42:39.666 --> 00:42:41.888]  They don't even understand true racism.
[00:42:41.888 --> 00:42:47.653]  Okay, but yet here they are in a park, pretending like they've actually done something that actually defeated the slave owner.
[00:42:47.653 --> 00:42:48.114]  Look at me!
[00:42:48.114 --> 00:42:49.255]  I've defeated the slave owner!
[00:42:49.255 --> 00:42:50.796]  I've defeated racism!
[00:42:50.796 --> 00:42:52.018]  No, you're kicking a statue!
[00:42:53.243 --> 00:42:55.984]  It's that right there is the mindset of these people.
[00:42:55.984 --> 00:43:02.508]  So I don't know how we can get the numbers on our side, but I think we're going to find that they're on our side when we go to the polls.
[00:43:02.508 --> 00:43:03.828]  I totally agree.
[00:43:03.828 --> 00:43:06.750]  And that's what God always gives us is a choice.
[00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:09.411]  Especially a great nation like this that was founded as Christian.
[00:43:09.411 --> 00:43:11.292]  We're being given a choice to turn back.
[00:43:11.292 --> 00:43:12.833]  We're being given a choice at prosperity.
[00:43:12.833 --> 00:43:14.654]  We're being given a choice to really come together.
[00:43:14.654 --> 00:43:16.815]  We're being given a real loving president.
[00:43:17.677 --> 00:43:45.331]  Who has courage, who loves God, and who really wants to bring folks together, and we've got a bunch of frothing evil liars in front of the Arab Spring, globalism, world government, the breakdown of the family, hissing and screaming saying we run your lives, hyping up a bunch of well-meaning young people who think they're Captain America and are getting a chance to go fight a Nazi, when in reality George Soros finances almost all of it, and he is literally, according to MI6, the real character behind the modern-day Spectre.
[00:43:45.891 --> 00:43:48.312]  Okay, I mean, you cannot make this up.
[00:43:48.312 --> 00:43:50.353]  So let's start going to the press conference here.
[00:43:50.353 --> 00:43:55.154]  This is right after he breaks down five minutes of incredible, real economic news.
[00:43:55.154 --> 00:43:59.656]  And then they say, why are people leaving the manufacturing board?
[00:43:59.656 --> 00:44:00.376]  Well, he answers it.
[00:44:00.376 --> 00:44:01.196]  It's true.
[00:44:01.196 --> 00:44:06.178]  Merck and Under Armour have been given seven months to just bring something back here.
[00:44:07.168 --> 00:44:12.675]  And he's given them all sorts of deals, opportunities, you know, to do this.
[00:44:12.675 --> 00:44:14.418]  And our media calls that corrupt.
[00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:15.519]  That's called free market.
[00:44:15.519 --> 00:44:16.981]  That's called nationalism.
[00:44:16.981 --> 00:44:19.224]  And then he says, why did you wait so long on the statement?
[00:44:19.224 --> 00:44:19.845]  Didn't do that.
[00:44:21.597 --> 00:44:24.658]  Again, he talks about gaslighting, how they're brainwashing people.
[00:44:24.658 --> 00:44:28.421]  Talks about Walmart, says you missed a critical opportunity to bring the country together.
[00:44:28.421 --> 00:44:30.822]  This is Walmart with its slave factories.
[00:44:30.822 --> 00:44:33.164]  This is just so incredibly sick to see.
[00:44:33.164 --> 00:44:38.787]  Chelsea Clinton sending out tweets about always be radical, always choose a side, always be aggressive.
[00:44:38.787 --> 00:44:44.651]  Basically don't come together when they're involved in slave factories and stealing people's money and robbing Haitians.
[00:44:44.651 --> 00:44:47.072]  I mean, this is just such a sick, evil group.
[00:44:47.072 --> 00:44:47.893]  Always remember that.
[00:44:47.893 --> 00:44:49.234]  Let's start rolling the press conference.
[00:44:50.206 --> 00:44:53.127]  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
[00:44:53.127 --> 00:44:56.868]  Why do you think these CEOs are leaving your manufacturing council?
[00:44:56.868 --> 00:45:02.630]  Because they're not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country.
[00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.771]  We want jobs manufacturing in this country.
[00:45:05.771 --> 00:45:10.472]  If you look at some of those people that you're talking about, they're outside of the country.
[00:45:10.472 --> 00:45:13.553]  They're having a lot of their product made outside.
[00:45:13.553 --> 00:45:17.214]  If you look at Merck as an example, take a look where, excuse me, excuse me.
[00:45:17.714 --> 00:45:19.896]  Take a look at where their product is made.
[00:45:19.896 --> 00:45:22.059]  It's made outside of our country.
[00:45:22.059 --> 00:45:24.321]  We want products made in the country.
[00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:32.028]  Now I have to tell you, some of the folks that will leave, they're leaving out of embarrassment, because they make their products outside.
[00:45:32.028 --> 00:45:38.415]  And I've been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you're referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country.
[00:45:38.415 --> 00:45:39.656]  That's right, they're paused.
[00:45:41.687 --> 00:45:43.569]  Did pause, back it up 10 seconds.
[00:45:43.569 --> 00:45:45.170]  And it's not like he's just saying that.
[00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:47.012]  I read the business pages.
[00:45:47.012 --> 00:45:49.134]  I read them online probably 45 minutes a day.
[00:45:49.134 --> 00:45:52.137]  It's one of the least areas I do study, but I study it.
[00:45:52.137 --> 00:45:59.985]  He's been grilling every day, calling some days 200, 300 companies, having meetings with them a couple days a week, taking them golfing.
[00:46:01.018 --> 00:46:01.478]  The Big Ones.
[00:46:22.369 --> 00:46:24.171]  And then he's got these guys on his board.
[00:46:24.171 --> 00:46:25.993]  He's going, look, I'm going to get you the tax break.
[00:46:25.993 --> 00:46:27.194]  Breaks everything.
[00:46:27.194 --> 00:46:28.075]  What do you have to lose?
[00:46:28.075 --> 00:46:30.037]  Bring the factories back.
[00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:30.918]  Start something here.
[00:46:30.918 --> 00:46:32.320]  Make something here.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.922]  Make the foam that goes in the shoes.
[00:46:33.922 --> 00:46:35.723]  Make the fabric or something.
[00:46:35.723 --> 00:46:36.825]  Sew it together here.
[00:46:36.825 --> 00:46:37.666]  You're going to do something.
[00:46:38.961 --> 00:46:39.982]  And he's like, why won't you do it?
[00:46:39.982 --> 00:46:41.482]  Because you're a globalist.
[00:46:41.482 --> 00:46:43.243]  So again, he's embarrassed them.
[00:46:43.243 --> 00:46:45.284]  They're economically hurting America.
[00:46:45.284 --> 00:46:51.547]  They're economically knowing that it's part of globalism to make us poor, to make us dependent as part of a strategic plan.
[00:46:51.547 --> 00:46:52.728]  And Trump's calling them out.
[00:46:52.728 --> 00:46:57.010]  So then they leave when they're the traitors on, oh, look at the race stuff.
[00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:05.654]  He didn't decry it enough to get little cheap points when they're the ones that actually screwed you over as part of an organized plan of economic warfare against everyone.
[00:47:05.654 --> 00:47:05.974]  Here it is.
[00:47:07.757 --> 00:47:15.280]  And I've been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you're referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:19.481]  You can't do it necessarily in Ireland and all of these other places.
[00:47:19.481 --> 00:47:22.922]  You have to bring this work back to this country.
[00:47:22.922 --> 00:47:23.802]  That's what I want.
[00:47:23.802 --> 00:47:29.965]  I want manufacturing to be back into the United States so that American workers can benefit.
[00:47:32.062 --> 00:47:33.443]  Some are saying, oh, he doesn't like Ireland.
[00:47:33.443 --> 00:47:34.903]  He's singled out Irish.
[00:47:34.903 --> 00:47:36.384]  The Irish don't get any of the money.
[00:47:36.384 --> 00:47:44.427]  They use this double Irish thing where they mix the money around twice so that the money gets stuck there and stays in banks and nobody ever gets it but the elites.
[00:47:44.427 --> 00:47:47.148]  So he's talking about basically offshoring money.
[00:47:47.148 --> 00:47:50.189]  But the media spun that, that, oh, he doesn't want Irish to have jobs.
[00:47:50.189 --> 00:47:50.809]  Let's go back to it.
[00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.151]  I didn't wait long.
[00:47:55.151 --> 00:47:56.532]  I didn't wait long.
[00:47:56.532 --> 00:47:57.513]  I didn't wait long.
[00:47:57.513 --> 00:48:04.139]  I wanted to make sure, unlike most politicians, that what I said was correct.
[00:48:04.139 --> 00:48:05.480]  Not make a quick statement.
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:09.904]  The statement I made on Saturday, the first statement, was a fine statement.
[00:48:09.904 --> 00:48:14.368]  But you don't make statements that direct unless you know the fact.
[00:48:14.368 --> 00:48:16.369]  It takes a little while to get the facts.
[00:48:16.369 --> 00:48:17.670]  You still don't know the facts.
[00:48:18.587 --> 00:48:22.690]  And it's a very, very important process to me.
[00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:24.371]  And it's a very important statement.
[00:48:24.371 --> 00:48:29.435]  So I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement.
[00:48:29.435 --> 00:48:30.836]  I want to know the facts.
[00:48:30.836 --> 00:48:33.959]  If you go back to my, in fact, I brought it.
[00:48:33.959 --> 00:48:35.620]  I brought it.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.200]  I brought it.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.082]  Notice how it's handwritten.
[00:48:38.795 --> 00:48:49.284]  As I said on, remember, the Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.
[00:48:49.284 --> 00:48:51.066]  It has no place in America.
[00:48:51.066 --> 00:48:52.627]  And then I went on from there.
[00:48:52.627 --> 00:48:54.029]  Now, here's the thing.
[00:48:54.029 --> 00:48:55.210]  Excuse me, excuse me.
[00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:57.111]  That's what they hate, because that's the president right there.
[00:48:57.111 --> 00:48:58.473]  Here's the thing.
[00:48:58.473 --> 00:49:00.735]  When I make a statement, I like to be correct.
[00:49:00.735 --> 00:49:01.315]  I want the facts.
[00:49:02.435 --> 00:49:03.856]  Back it up 10 seconds, please.
[00:49:03.856 --> 00:49:05.016]  That's what they hate.
[00:49:05.016 --> 00:49:07.617]  Because, because, that's, I've talked to folks that are around Trump all the time.
[00:49:07.617 --> 00:49:10.299]  He may take a few ideas, things, but he handwrites stuff out.
[00:49:10.299 --> 00:49:12.180]  Rarely he hands it off to them to go type it.
[00:49:12.180 --> 00:49:14.221]  He wrote his address to Congress.
[00:49:14.221 --> 00:49:16.682]  This hasn't happened in like 50, 60 years, folks.
[00:49:16.682 --> 00:49:18.983]  I mean, even Kennedy wasn't writing his own statements.
[00:49:18.983 --> 00:49:21.764]  Eisenhower was one of the last people to actually write part of his statements.
[00:49:21.764 --> 00:49:23.245]  This guy wrote his statements.
[00:49:23.985 --> 00:49:26.127]  And you can see it's written in marker.
[00:49:26.127 --> 00:49:31.910]  He sat there, watched it, tried to figure out what was going on, came out a few hours after it, wrote a statement.
[00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:34.912]  He tweeted while it was happening and said, we decry all this racism.
[00:49:34.912 --> 00:49:36.734]  The point is, he's the president's team.
[00:49:36.734 --> 00:49:38.054]  No elite wrote that.
[00:49:38.054 --> 00:49:40.756]  That's why the elites want control of the big American power.
[00:49:40.756 --> 00:49:44.138]  That's his big sin, is that he wrote it.
[00:49:44.138 --> 00:49:45.359]  He did it.
[00:49:45.359 --> 00:49:46.560]  He's real.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.141]  Let's go back to him.
[00:49:48.141 --> 00:49:48.862]  Get nice and easy.
[00:49:49.881 --> 00:49:51.281]  Here's the thing.
[00:49:51.281 --> 00:49:53.542]  When I make a statement, I like to be correct.
[00:49:53.542 --> 00:49:54.783]  I want the facts.
[00:49:54.783 --> 00:49:56.183]  This event just happened.
[00:49:56.183 --> 00:50:00.244]  In fact, a lot of the event didn't even happen yet as we were speaking.
[00:50:00.244 --> 00:50:01.985]  This event just happened.
[00:50:01.985 --> 00:50:05.266]  Before I make a statement, I need the facts.
[00:50:05.266 --> 00:50:07.226]  So I don't want to rush into a statement.
[00:50:07.226 --> 00:50:10.367]  So making the statement when I made it was excellent.
[00:50:10.367 --> 00:50:18.050]  In fact, the young woman who I hear is a fantastic young woman and it was on NBC, her mother wrote me.
[00:50:19.569 --> 00:50:24.386]  And said, through I guess Twitter, social media.
[00:50:25.726 --> 00:50:28.688]  The nicest things, and I very much appreciated that.
[00:50:28.688 --> 00:50:33.272]  I hear she was a fine, really actually an incredible young woman.
[00:50:33.272 --> 00:50:36.995]  But her mother on Twitter thanked me for what I said.
[00:50:36.995 --> 00:50:43.721]  And honestly, if the press were not fake, and if it was honest, the press would have said what I said was very nice.
[00:50:43.721 --> 00:50:51.067]  But unlike you and unlike, excuse me, unlike you and unlike the media, before I make a statement, I like to know the facts.
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.081]  They don't.
[00:50:55.081 --> 00:50:57.383]  They don't.
[00:50:57.383 --> 00:50:58.424]  They don't.
[00:50:58.424 --> 00:51:03.808]  How about a couple of- Mr. Trump, was it terrorism, that event?
[00:51:03.808 --> 00:51:05.369]  Was that terrorism?
[00:51:05.369 --> 00:51:05.930]  Say it, what?
[00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:10.733]  The CEO of Walmart said he missed a critical opportunity to help bring the country together.
[00:51:10.733 --> 00:51:11.294]  Did you?
[00:51:12.034 --> 00:51:12.534]  Not at all.
[00:51:12.534 --> 00:51:16.357]  I think the country, look, you take a look.
[00:51:16.357 --> 00:51:19.599]  I've created over a million jobs since I'm president.
[00:51:19.599 --> 00:51:20.660]  The country is booming.
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:22.241]  The stock market is setting records.
[00:51:22.241 --> 00:51:26.684]  We have the highest employment numbers we've ever had in the history of our country.
[00:51:26.684 --> 00:51:28.045]  We're doing record business.
[00:51:28.045 --> 00:51:31.267]  We have the highest levels of enthusiasm.
[00:51:31.267 --> 00:51:35.690]  So the head of Walmart, who I know is a very nice guy, was making a political statement.
[00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:40.893]  I mean, I'm doing it the same way, and you know why?
[00:51:40.893 --> 00:51:47.198]  Because I want to make sure when I make a statement that the statement is correct.
[00:51:47.198 --> 00:51:53.482]  And there was no way, there was no way of making a correct statement that- You know what's crazy?
[00:51:53.482 --> 00:51:55.684]  If they're able to defeat Trump, we're defeating ourselves.
[00:51:56.701 --> 00:52:01.907]  I mean, look how God's giving us all this prosperity, all this incredible stuff, right in our face.
[00:52:01.907 --> 00:52:02.448]  Everything coming.
[00:52:02.448 --> 00:52:13.221]  He wants to unlock all the gene editing, all the technology for live extension that the globalists, the Democrats and Republicans don't want you under Obamacare to have access to all this advanced live extension.
[00:52:13.221 --> 00:52:14.683]  He wants you to have access to all of it.
[00:52:16.041 --> 00:52:20.443]  I mean, you know, his actions are incredibly real.
[00:52:20.443 --> 00:52:25.906]  And he's just surrounded by scum, surrounded by the swamp, and he's trying to turn the economy on for the people.
[00:52:25.906 --> 00:52:27.267]  It's amazing.
[00:52:27.267 --> 00:52:27.907]  It's just amazing.
[00:52:27.907 --> 00:52:38.592]  And then Walmart is this paragon of, oh, getting a political shot in, decrying the fake headlines that he didn't disavow, when they lie and say that constantly.
[00:52:38.592 --> 00:52:40.853]  They're saying he didn't disavow on Monday now.
[00:52:40.853 --> 00:52:42.334]  They're saying he didn't disavow yesterday.
[00:52:43.439 --> 00:52:49.201]  When he said that there were people on both sides that came not looking for trouble who had rights to a symbol in America.
[00:52:49.201 --> 00:52:50.022]  What about that?
[00:52:50.022 --> 00:52:51.742]  Let's go back to the clip.
[00:52:51.742 --> 00:52:55.304]  I didn't know David Duke was there.
[00:52:55.304 --> 00:52:58.005]  I wanted to see the facts.
[00:52:58.005 --> 00:53:02.767]  And the facts as they started coming out were very well stated.
[00:53:02.767 --> 00:53:05.448]  In fact, everybody said his statement was beautiful.
[00:53:06.598 --> 00:53:20.987]  You've got to understand, back when Trump grew up around the same time as my dad, the KKK was so uncool that when I talked about my grandfather standing up for the KKK, my dad went, well, Alex, it wasn't that hard.
[00:53:20.987 --> 00:53:22.008]  Everybody hated him.
[00:53:22.008 --> 00:53:23.189]  They were all toothless idiots.
[00:53:23.189 --> 00:53:25.210]  I mean, OK, yeah, he did.
[00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:26.951]  But it's like they were a joke then.
[00:53:26.951 --> 00:53:29.192]  The media takes these people, builds them up.
[00:53:29.192 --> 00:53:31.594]  Most of them are actors.
[00:53:31.594 --> 00:53:34.876]  And it's come out most of them are actors.
[00:53:34.876 --> 00:53:35.737]  It's totally staged.
[00:53:36.667 --> 00:53:40.729]  And the media falls into our trap when they attack me saying, oh, he says they're actors when they've been caught.
[00:53:40.729 --> 00:53:44.070]  You know, so many groups, you know, out doing this.
[00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:51.493]  In fact, put that Charlottesville picture up about the mother and then just a photo of the of the KKK guys there and look closely at those photos.
[00:53:52.153 --> 00:53:54.955]  When I saw those photos, I said, is that a black guy?
[00:53:54.955 --> 00:54:00.037]  Because when I saw the KKK guys, it looked like they were partially African American.
[00:54:00.037 --> 00:54:04.440]  And that was the weird thing when I've been to these rallies, is that it looks like minorities in the KKK outfits.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.041]  I mean, I have video of this.
[00:54:06.041 --> 00:54:09.823]  This is really, like, they can't even get real white idiots to go do this.
[00:54:09.823 --> 00:54:10.943]  Like, I want to find this guy.
[00:54:10.943 --> 00:54:19.188]  Because, oh, you know, the organizer formerly worked for Obama and worked for Black Lives Matter and worked for Occupy Wall Street and worked for the Democrats.
[00:54:19.188 --> 00:54:20.529]  But, oh, now he's the leader of it.
[00:54:21.149 --> 00:54:23.731]  I mean, see how I'm saying they're always Democrats?
[00:54:23.731 --> 00:54:24.672]  They are.
[00:54:24.672 --> 00:54:25.433]  I mean, look at this guy.
[00:54:25.433 --> 00:54:26.874]  Look at this guy.
[00:54:26.874 --> 00:54:27.875]  And I saw a video of him.
[00:54:27.875 --> 00:54:28.195]  I saw him.
[00:54:28.195 --> 00:54:30.217]  I go, I go, dude, dude, that guy.
[00:54:30.217 --> 00:54:35.421]  I mean, that guy does not look like he's, you know, but, you know, they let him in the prisons.
[00:54:35.421 --> 00:54:38.544]  They let, because they're so lucky.
[00:54:38.544 --> 00:54:39.605]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:54:39.605 --> 00:54:42.868]  They let people that whose mothers are white now.
[00:54:44.512 --> 00:54:46.755]  So if your mother's white, you can join the KKK.
[00:54:46.755 --> 00:54:50.979]  So you've got these self-hating people who hate their brown side.
[00:54:50.979 --> 00:54:54.163]  I mean, I'm proud of my Native American heritage.
[00:54:54.163 --> 00:54:56.605]  And then they, I mean, is that guy Native American?
[00:54:56.605 --> 00:55:01.310]  A lot of the Native Americans, you know, intermarry with blacks, I mean, I don't know.
[00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:04.514]  It's just absolutely crazy, but I'm proud of the fact
[00:55:05.094 --> 00:55:10.001]  You know, that I'm not completely Anglo-Saxon or whatever you call it.
[00:55:10.001 --> 00:55:12.384]  I'm proud of my Native American roots, but I don't know.
[00:55:12.384 --> 00:55:13.385]  Let's just continue here.
[00:55:13.385 --> 00:55:17.651]  We're going to go on to the next segment with the Trump newscast where he just destroys them.
[00:55:17.651 --> 00:55:20.014]  A real press conference facing down these liars.
[00:55:20.014 --> 00:55:20.335]  Here it is.
[00:55:20.794 --> 00:55:23.195]  You would have made it sooner, that would have been good.
[00:55:23.195 --> 00:55:27.317]  I couldn't have made it sooner because I didn't know all of the facts.
[00:55:27.317 --> 00:55:34.000]  Frankly, people still don't know all of the facts.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.122]  It was very important to me to get the facts out and correctly.
[00:55:39.122 --> 00:55:42.284]  Because if I would have made a fast statement, and the first statement was made
[00:55:43.044 --> 00:55:45.805]  Without knowing much other than what we were seeing.
[00:55:45.805 --> 00:55:50.087]  The second statement was made after with knowledge, with great knowledge.
[00:55:50.087 --> 00:55:55.189]  There's still things, excuse me, there's still things that people don't know.
[00:55:55.189 --> 00:55:57.170]  I want to make a statement with knowledge.
[00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:58.210]  I wanted to know the facts.
[00:55:58.210 --> 00:56:00.311]  Okay.
[00:56:00.311 --> 00:56:01.732]  That's something we know now.
[00:56:01.732 --> 00:56:02.652]  Was this terrorism?
[00:56:02.652 --> 00:56:05.233]  And can you tell us how you're feeling about your chief strategist?
[00:56:05.233 --> 00:56:06.994]  The driver of the car.
[00:56:07.992 --> 00:56:12.495]  Is a disgrace to himself, his family, and this country.
[00:56:12.495 --> 00:56:14.016]  He's a loser.
[00:56:14.016 --> 00:56:16.038]  You can call it terrorism.
[00:56:16.038 --> 00:56:17.019]  You can call it murder.
[00:56:17.019 --> 00:56:19.921]  You can call it whatever you want.
[00:56:19.921 --> 00:56:23.924]  I would just call it as the fastest one to come up with a good verdict.
[00:56:23.924 --> 00:56:25.285]  That's what I'd call it.
[00:56:25.285 --> 00:56:26.445]  Because there is a question.
[00:56:26.445 --> 00:56:27.126]  Is it murder?
[00:56:27.126 --> 00:56:28.367]  Is it terrorism?
[00:56:28.367 --> 00:56:28.627]  Yes.
[00:56:28.627 --> 00:56:31.089]  Then you get into legal semantics.
[00:56:31.089 --> 00:56:32.390]  The driver of the car
[00:56:33.516 --> 00:56:34.797]  Is a murderer.
[00:56:34.797 --> 00:56:38.959]  And what he did was a horrible, horrible, inexcusable cowardly thing.
[00:56:38.959 --> 00:56:41.801]  Can you tell us how you're feeling about your chief strategist, Mr. Bannon?
[00:56:41.801 --> 00:56:42.842]  Can you talk about that?
[00:56:42.842 --> 00:56:44.763]  I would echo Maggie's question.
[00:56:44.763 --> 00:56:47.104]  Steve Bannon is- I never spoke to Mr. Bannon about it.
[00:56:47.104 --> 00:56:51.187]  Can you tell us broadly what your- do you still have confidence in- Well, we'll see.
[00:56:51.187 --> 00:56:52.347]  Look, look.
[00:56:52.347 --> 00:56:53.288]  I like Mr. Bannon.
[00:56:53.288 --> 00:56:54.128]  He's a friend of mine.
[00:56:54.128 --> 00:56:54.729]  Hit pause again.
[00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:58.031]  He's in New Jersey.
[00:56:58.031 --> 00:57:03.376]  He writes it on the back of a piece of paper, his statement, basically the same thing he said on Twitter while it was happening.
[00:57:03.376 --> 00:57:04.237]  He's the president.
[00:57:04.237 --> 00:57:05.097]  He's smart.
[00:57:05.097 --> 00:57:05.938]  He's informed.
[00:57:05.938 --> 00:57:15.827]  Bannon is doing the whole strategy of the bills and the legislation and the executive orders to turn the economy back on because Trump agrees with it in a big office they've got with whiteboards.
[00:57:15.827 --> 00:57:16.988]  That's what he does with Bannon.
[00:57:16.988 --> 00:57:18.609]  But Bannon doesn't tell Trump what to do.
[00:57:18.609 --> 00:57:21.932]  We're going to go to break here in a moment.
[00:57:21.932 --> 00:57:22.632]  Please don't forget.
[00:57:23.564 --> 00:57:38.338]  We've taken last month's special and this month's specials and combined them, calling it the BuzzFeed special, because they made me so angry at first, then it was a big joke, when they tested our products and found they were the cleanest out there, California standard, untold, almost no one can do it.
[00:57:38.338 --> 00:57:40.039]  Well, you know we're under that scrutiny, obviously, folks.
[00:57:40.039 --> 00:57:40.820]  I mean, so, you know.
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:44.964]  We go to the very best, cleanest labs, best companies, get the best stuff private-labeled.
[00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:48.293]  They have the top label, B12, $35.
[00:57:48.293 --> 00:57:50.255]  They sell on their own operation.
[00:57:50.255 --> 00:57:52.058]  We sell it for $17.76, normally about $25.
[00:57:52.058 --> 00:57:56.984]  So normally it's no discount at $5, $10, but it's discounted almost $13 right now.
[00:57:56.984 --> 00:58:01.449]  Secret 12 available, InfowarsStore.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139 and we've got...
[00:58:04.833 --> 00:58:06.514]  Dozens and dozens of products.

[00:58:07.895 --> 00:58:08.935]  Take advantage of that.
[00:58:08.935 --> 00:58:10.856]  Yield it to yourself and it supports the broadcast.
[00:58:10.856 --> 00:58:12.337]  Yield it to yourself and it supports the broadcast.
[00:58:12.337 --> 00:58:15.199]  Where could you fund something more vicious against the New World Order?
[00:58:15.199 --> 00:58:18.040]  With truth, so savage, with the love of victory.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:20.061]  Survival Shield X2, the good halogen.
[00:58:20.061 --> 00:58:22.063]  Secret 12, Biotrue Selenium.
[00:58:22.063 --> 00:58:23.904]  Silver Bullet, MycoZX.
[00:58:23.904 --> 00:58:24.404]  Caveman.
[00:58:24.824 --> 00:58:26.225]  Alexa Pure Pro, 25% off.
[00:58:26.225 --> 00:58:28.466]  Alexa Breeze, 25% off.
[00:58:28.466 --> 00:58:30.348]  Vitamineral Fusion, 35% off.
[00:58:30.348 --> 00:58:32.929]  Again, 66% off on colloidal silver.
[00:58:32.929 --> 00:58:35.531]  Free shipping as well on many of the products.
[00:58:35.531 --> 00:58:39.153]  Take action today and rub it in BuzzFeed's dirty, evil face.
[00:58:39.153 --> 00:58:41.215]  More of President Trump, Victoria, straight ahead.
[00:58:41.215 --> 00:58:42.555]  Stay with us.
[00:58:42.555 --> 00:58:44.657]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:55.268]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:58:55.268 --> 00:58:57.370]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:02.657]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:59:02.657 --> 00:59:06.422]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[00:59:06.502 --> 00:59:09.945]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:59:09.945 --> 00:59:13.127]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:59:13.127 --> 00:59:17.011]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:59:17.011 --> 00:59:24.176]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:59:24.176 --> 00:59:29.561]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[00:59:29.841 --> 00:59:32.003]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:00.339 --> 01:00:07.201]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[01:00:07.201 --> 01:00:16.003]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them on our journey to hell.
[01:00:16.003 --> 01:00:18.664]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:22.316 --> 01:00:26.840]  I'm too confident in myself to look down on you for what color you are to feel powerful about myself.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.702]  I already feel so successful and good.
[01:00:28.702 --> 01:00:29.502]  I want to empower you.
[01:00:29.502 --> 01:00:30.884]  I want you to empower me.
[01:00:30.884 --> 01:00:33.606]  Now, if you want to run me over and slay me, I don't care what color you are.
[01:00:33.606 --> 01:00:34.227]  I'm coming after you.
[01:00:35.034 --> 01:00:40.998]  We got a bunch of old white men, a bunch of old globalists wanting to get rid of the family, demonizing the free market economy.
[01:00:40.998 --> 01:00:43.979]  Everything they're doing is to sabotage to get full control.
[01:00:43.979 --> 01:00:50.984]  Owen Schroer is going to be hosting the rest of the transmission while I'm out here on a work occasion on the West Coast.
[01:00:50.984 --> 01:00:59.289]  We've got so much coming up today, but let's continue with the powerful press conference where Trump just savaged the globalists yesterday.
[01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:00.569]  Tell us broadly what you're feeling.
[01:01:00.569 --> 01:01:02.491]  Do you guys still have confidence in the team?
[01:01:02.491 --> 01:01:03.051]  Well, let's see.
[01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:04.729]  I like Mr. Bannon.
[01:01:04.729 --> 01:01:06.110]  He's a friend of mine.
[01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.091]  But Mr. Bannon came on very late.
[01:01:08.091 --> 01:01:08.771]  You know that.
[01:01:08.771 --> 01:01:14.293]  I went through 17 senators, governors, and I won all the primaries.
[01:01:14.293 --> 01:01:17.334]  Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that.
[01:01:17.334 --> 01:01:18.415]  And I like him.
[01:01:18.415 --> 01:01:19.195]  He's a good man.
[01:01:19.195 --> 01:01:21.776]  He is not a racist.
[01:01:21.776 --> 01:01:22.776]  I can tell you that.
[01:01:22.776 --> 01:01:23.817]  He's a good person.
[01:01:23.817 --> 01:01:26.518]  He actually gets a very unfair press in that regard.
[01:01:27.438 --> 01:01:29.760]  But we'll see what happens with Mr. Bannon.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:35.644]  But he's a good person, and I think the press treats him, frankly, very unfairly.
[01:01:35.644 --> 01:01:40.207]  Senator McCain has called on you to defend your National Security Advisor, H.R.
[01:01:40.207 --> 01:01:42.288]  McMaster, against one of these attacks.
[01:01:42.288 --> 01:01:43.449]  I did it the last time.
[01:01:43.449 --> 01:01:45.791]  He called on it again, linking the- Senator McCain?
[01:01:45.791 --> 01:01:51.575]  Senator McCain, you mean the one who voted against Obamacare?
[01:01:51.575 --> 01:01:56.378]  You mean Senator McCain who voted against us getting good health care?
[01:01:57.110 --> 01:01:57.811]  Hey, pause.
[01:02:05.333 --> 01:02:06.134]  Let's back it up.
[01:02:06.134 --> 01:02:18.262]  McCain, the guy that funded the Arab Spring and Al Qaeda and ISIS, McCain of the Keating Five, of the Hanoi Hilton, McCain just involved in helping get Obamacare passed, who is a Democrat and is the leader of the Democratic Party.
[01:02:18.262 --> 01:02:22.866]  They admit he is the highest polling member of the Democratic Party who's a male.
[01:02:22.866 --> 01:02:27.609]  His counterpart, Pocahontas, is the highest poller.
[01:02:27.609 --> 01:02:29.651]  So, I mean, he's the leader of the Democratic Party.
[01:02:30.694 --> 01:02:32.935]  That's how the Republicans have sabotaged this country.
[01:02:32.935 --> 01:02:38.637]  And we're taking back the states, we're taking back the state houses, we're taking back the systems.
[01:02:38.637 --> 01:02:44.618]  And they know it, that's why they're panicking and lying and trying everything they can, because it's not working.
[01:02:44.618 --> 01:02:51.501]  Then they bring up Bannon, like his first statement was written by Bannon, and it was racist when it wasn't racist, and it wasn't written by Bannon.
[01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:55.462]  Then they bring up John McCain, one of the biggest liars in the world, here it is.
[01:02:56.937 --> 01:02:58.397]  I'm going to come back and do some more on this.
[01:02:58.397 --> 01:02:59.138]  This is too important.
[01:02:59.138 --> 01:03:00.858]  Do you understand how smart Trump is?
[01:03:00.858 --> 01:03:02.519]  We're going to play more of the clip in a minute.
[01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:28.831]  He says, define alt-right for me.
[01:03:28.831 --> 01:03:38.455]  Because Hillary creates the term nine and a half months ago, says it's everybody that opposes her, and then now that it's a new term they own, they can then attach whoever they want to it.
[01:03:38.455 --> 01:03:41.936]  Oh, look, Alex Jones and Donald Trump are alt-right, that's KKK.
[01:03:41.936 --> 01:03:46.918]  They say alt-right, then they say, oh, that's KKK, then they say, oh, Stephen Bannon runs it, he's KKK.
[01:03:46.918 --> 01:03:48.079]  Just all made up.
[01:03:48.079 --> 01:03:50.600]  So he says, okay, you define alt-right for me.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.880]  Knowing they can't.
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.201]  Knowing it's a trick.
[01:03:53.201 --> 01:03:54.321]  Man, he's good.
[01:03:54.321 --> 01:03:56.122]  Let's play another minute of this.
[01:03:56.923 --> 01:03:57.743]  Let's go.
[01:03:57.743 --> 01:04:00.344]  Senator McCain defined them as the same group.
[01:04:00.344 --> 01:04:02.985]  Okay, what about the alt-left that came charging him?
[01:04:02.985 --> 01:04:03.785]  Excuse me.
[01:04:03.785 --> 01:04:08.447]  What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?
[01:04:08.447 --> 01:04:12.508]  Do they have any semblance of guilt?
[01:04:12.508 --> 01:04:14.389]  Let me ask you this.
[01:04:14.389 --> 01:04:19.471]  What about the fact that they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs?
[01:04:19.471 --> 01:04:21.551]  Do they have any problem?
[01:04:21.551 --> 01:04:23.032]  I think they do.
[01:04:23.032 --> 01:04:24.873]  As far as I'm concerned... Alright, pause.
[01:04:24.873 --> 01:04:25.353]  We're going to break.
[01:04:26.152 --> 01:04:28.254]  I'm going to come back and play the rest of this, go to Paczenek.
[01:04:28.254 --> 01:04:29.655]  He'll be with us until about 45 after.
[01:04:29.655 --> 01:04:32.957]  We're going to play that compilation of where he's disavowed all this over and over again.
[01:04:32.957 --> 01:04:37.421]  We're putting new compilation on together with the latest things where they're saying he won't disavow.
[01:04:37.421 --> 01:04:40.423]  Infowars.com is the Patriot site.
[01:04:40.423 --> 01:04:43.866]  We now have Newswars.com that loads quicker on phones and things like that.
[01:04:43.866 --> 01:04:45.787]  Go check out Newswars.com.
[01:04:45.787 --> 01:04:48.489]  Newswars.com has a lot of exclusive information.
[01:04:48.489 --> 01:04:50.130]  Please tweet it out on Twitter.
[01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:52.032]  We need to create a new Facebook for Newswars as well.
[01:04:56.708 --> 01:04:58.129]  Why is the fungus?
[01:04:58.129 --> 01:04:59.211]  Why is the mold?
[01:04:59.211 --> 01:05:00.953]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[01:05:00.953 --> 01:05:01.935]  What is going on?
[01:05:01.935 --> 01:05:02.696]  What has changed?
[01:05:10.947 --> 01:05:18.316]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[01:05:18.316 --> 01:05:20.078]  It's available at infomorestore.com.
[01:05:20.078 --> 01:05:24.283]  We also have free shipping, orders for $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[01:05:24.283 --> 01:05:26.105]  Additionally, on top of that, please...
[01:05:26.986 --> 01:05:28.427]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[01:05:28.427 --> 01:05:30.388]  I want to get your reviews on here, what you have to say.
[01:05:30.388 --> 01:05:31.829]  For me, it's been incredible.
[01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:36.372]  MycoZX, antifungal, uh, antifungus, uh, anti-yeast.
[01:05:36.372 --> 01:05:37.193]  Get it today.
[01:05:37.193 --> 01:05:37.713]  Limited run.
[01:05:37.713 --> 01:05:39.094]  It'll be months till we get more.
[01:05:39.094 --> 01:05:43.757]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:05:43.757 --> 01:05:47.099]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[01:05:47.099 --> 01:05:49.441]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[01:05:49.441 --> 01:05:51.302]  Look at the response we're getting.
[01:05:51.302 --> 01:05:52.783]  We're changing the world together.
[01:05:52.783 --> 01:05:53.783]  You are the InfoWar.
[01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:54.544]  God bless you all.
[01:05:56.488 --> 01:06:01.892]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:06:01.892 --> 01:06:04.754]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:06:04.754 --> 01:06:06.736]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:06:06.736 --> 01:06:11.760]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.861]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:06:13.861 --> 01:06:15.142]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:06:15.142 --> 01:06:20.266]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:06:20.266 --> 01:06:23.609]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[01:06:23.769 --> 01:06:24.269]  We're good to go!
[01:06:52.224 --> 01:06:58.411]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:06:58.411 --> 01:07:00.433]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:03.337]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:07:03.337 --> 01:07:06.300]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:09.401]  We're absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:18.583]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:26.104]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:07:26.104 --> 01:07:34.146]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of its toxic effects for themselves.
[01:07:34.146 --> 01:07:35.106]  The general public doesn't.
[01:07:36.327 --> 01:07:40.271]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:07:40.271 --> 01:07:43.834]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:07:43.834 --> 01:07:50.539]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:07:50.539 --> 01:07:54.703]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[01:08:04.332 --> 01:08:09.733]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:09.733 --> 01:08:24.957]  Alright, the former head of psychological operations of the State Department, the Army and other groups is going to give us his expert take on the clear PSYOP, I mean it's in the WikiLeaks, to create racial division in America and stop the plan.
[01:08:25.737 --> 01:08:26.818]  That I don't even know who developed it.
[01:08:26.818 --> 01:08:31.403]  I remember Pachinic like 10 years ago saying they're going to devolve power back to the Midwest, back to the South.
[01:08:31.403 --> 01:08:33.224]  We're going to unify everybody around free market.
[01:08:33.224 --> 01:08:37.388]  And we're going to break the back of the controlled left and the Republican establishment.
[01:08:37.388 --> 01:08:39.030]  And then the EU is going to implode.
[01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:41.592]  And then we're going to have the second American Renaissance.
[01:08:41.592 --> 01:08:43.855]  Well, I already kind of had that idea, but Dr. Steve Pachinic...
[01:08:44.375 --> 01:08:49.420]  You know, obviously talking to his sources inside the government said they were going to support that move.
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:58.730]  And that's why you see the left, the globalists, the Republican establishment freaking out with 400 billion in new jobs, 4 trillion in the stock market, over a thousand new companies.
[01:08:59.591 --> 01:09:06.434]  And just saying to the President, you're a racist, you're a racist, you're a racist, when he's giving three press conferences saying he decries racism.
[01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:08.175]  So, more of this throughout the hour.
[01:09:08.175 --> 01:09:11.297]  I'm going to get out of here and let Pecheneg host and take some of your calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:09:11.297 --> 01:09:17.139]  On the events, on what you're witnessing, on Korea, back and down.
[01:09:17.139 --> 01:09:21.602]  I got to tell you, Skousen's got some great sources, doesn't he?
[01:09:21.602 --> 01:09:25.984]  Boy, I'm telling you about going back forever, saying that if they launch those missiles at Guam,
[01:09:26.784 --> 01:09:27.805]  Trump was going to hit him.
[01:09:27.805 --> 01:09:28.725]  That's the word I got.
[01:09:28.725 --> 01:09:30.486]  Notice North Korea backed down.
[01:09:30.486 --> 01:09:33.548]  That's what Pchenix said was probably going to happen as well.
[01:09:33.548 --> 01:09:34.789]  So we'll talk about that as well.
[01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.849]  800-259-9231.
[01:09:34.849 --> 01:09:34.969]  800-259-9231.
[01:09:34.969 --> 01:09:36.390]  But first, a great point he made.
[01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:40.072]  Okay, Thomas Jefferson called for ending slavery in the first declaration, but they struck it.
[01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:49.409]  He was born with slaves.
[01:09:49.409 --> 01:09:52.151]  He ended up basically marrying one of them.
[01:09:52.151 --> 01:09:52.951]  They were slaves.
[01:09:52.951 --> 01:09:54.052]  They were treated horrible.
[01:09:54.052 --> 01:09:55.012]  Slaves were treated good.
[01:09:55.012 --> 01:09:57.274]  No one's defending the institution of slavery.
[01:09:57.274 --> 01:10:00.436]  It's going on in Saudi Arabia and Sudan today.
[01:10:00.436 --> 01:10:02.858]  The point was England was the first to get rid of it.
[01:10:02.858 --> 01:10:06.300]  And then would attack ships for a hundred years making it go away.
[01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:09.462]  Part of our Revolutionary War and the 1812 War came.
[01:10:09.462 --> 01:10:10.883]  England was saying you can't have slavery.
[01:10:12.045 --> 01:10:14.226]  Two percent of America was involved in slavery.
[01:10:14.226 --> 01:10:17.848]  It's not some guilt we all have, and other countries still have it going on.
[01:10:17.848 --> 01:10:19.269]  It's used to control us.
[01:10:19.269 --> 01:10:23.992]  So they say, oh, get rid of Robert E. Lee.
[01:10:23.992 --> 01:10:27.874]  Arlington Cemetery is where his farm was.
[01:10:27.874 --> 01:10:29.455]  He was on the Northern Army.
[01:10:29.455 --> 01:10:30.555]  He was the head of West Point.
[01:10:30.555 --> 01:10:32.136]  He didn't want to be in the war.
[01:10:32.136 --> 01:10:34.177]  But the North engaged in atrocities, so he joined it.
[01:10:34.177 --> 01:10:35.818]  I'm not on the North or the South.
[01:10:35.818 --> 01:10:40.581]  It was a tragic event engineered by British intelligence to break the country up, if you study it.
[01:10:41.391 --> 01:10:47.076]  But why does Trump, who's a great, wonderful Yankee of the classic sense, love Andrew Jackson?
[01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.998]  He stopped the first Civil War.
[01:10:48.998 --> 01:10:52.982]  Trump is trying to bring America together and stop the globalist plan for civil war.
[01:10:52.982 --> 01:10:54.944]  We'll see if Pachinik concurs with that.
[01:10:56.087 --> 01:10:57.888]  Because there was a planned civil war.
[01:10:57.888 --> 01:10:59.730]  Trump's fighting that globalist plan.
[01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:00.811]  We know that.
[01:11:00.811 --> 01:11:11.239]  We're going to play this clip and come out with Owen Schroyer hosting with Dr. Steve Pachenik of stevepachenik.com, co-author with Tom Clancy, so much more, founder of Delta Force with General Boykin and Shoemaker.
[01:11:11.239 --> 01:11:16.403]  Let's go ahead though and go to that clip and then back to our guest host.
[01:11:16.403 --> 01:11:19.506]  What you call the alt-left is the same as neo-Nazis?
[01:11:21.746 --> 01:11:26.308]  All of those people, excuse me, I've condemned neo-Nazis.
[01:11:26.308 --> 01:11:32.812]  I've condemned many different groups, but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me.
[01:11:32.812 --> 01:11:36.734]  Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.
[01:11:36.734 --> 01:11:37.455]  Those people...
[01:11:38.095 --> 01:11:44.360]  We're also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue of Robert E. Lee.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:57.669]  So, excuse me, and you take a look at some of the groups and you see, and you know it if you were honest reporters, which in many cases you're not, but many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.
[01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:00.631]  This week it's Robert E. Lee.
[01:12:00.631 --> 01:12:03.392]  I noticed that Stonewall Jackson's coming down.
[01:12:03.392 --> 01:12:05.753]  I wonder, is it George Washington next week?
[01:12:05.753 --> 01:12:08.054]  And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?
[01:12:08.054 --> 01:12:11.575]  You really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?
[01:12:11.575 --> 01:12:15.157]  But they were there to protest, excuse me.
[01:12:15.157 --> 01:12:21.239]  You take a look the night before, they were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.
[01:12:21.239 --> 01:12:23.160]  Infrastructure question, go ahead.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:26.181]  Should the statue of Robert E. Lee stay up?
[01:12:26.181 --> 01:12:27.902]  I would say that's up to a local
[01:12:28.868 --> 01:12:33.737]  Town, community, or the federal government depending on where it is located.
[01:12:33.737 --> 01:12:36.643]  Are you against the Confederacy?
[01:12:36.643 --> 01:12:40.290]  You're calling the alt-left and white supremacists on the same moral plane.
[01:12:41.158 --> 01:12:42.999]  I'm not putting anybody on a moral plane.
[01:12:42.999 --> 01:12:44.299]  What I'm saying is this.
[01:12:44.299 --> 01:12:53.222]  You had a group on one side, and you had a group on the other, and they came at each other with clubs, and it was vicious, and it was horrible, and it was a horrible thing to watch.
[01:12:53.222 --> 01:12:54.883]  But there is another side.
[01:12:54.883 --> 01:13:02.986]  There was a group on this side, you can call them the left, you've just called them the left, that came violently attacking the other group.
[01:13:02.986 --> 01:13:05.247]  So you can say what you want, but that's the way it is.
[01:13:07.748 --> 01:13:08.568]  On both sides, sir?
[01:13:08.568 --> 01:13:10.869]  You said there was hatred, there was violence on both sides?
[01:13:10.869 --> 01:13:12.730]  Well, I do think there's blame, yes.
[01:13:12.730 --> 01:13:14.711]  I think there's blame on both sides.
[01:13:14.711 --> 01:13:19.334]  You look at both sides, I think there's blame on both sides.
[01:13:19.334 --> 01:13:25.297]  And I have no doubt about it, and you don't have any doubt about it either.
[01:13:25.297 --> 01:13:28.198]  And if you reported it accurately, you would say.
[01:13:29.966 --> 01:13:31.348]  But you also had people that were
[01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:45.632]  Very fine people on both sides.
[01:13:45.632 --> 01:13:50.817]  You had people in that group, excuse me, excuse me, I saw the same pictures as you did.
[01:13:50.817 --> 01:14:02.526]  You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.
[01:14:02.526 --> 01:14:03.887]  George Washington was a slave owner.
[01:14:06.485 --> 01:14:08.887]  Was George Washington a slave owner?
[01:14:08.887 --> 01:14:11.650]  So will George Washington now lose his status?
[01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:18.516]  Are we going to take down statues to George Washington?
[01:14:18.516 --> 01:14:19.937]  How about Thomas Jefferson?
[01:14:19.937 --> 01:14:21.418]  What do you think of Thomas Jefferson?
[01:14:21.418 --> 01:14:22.820]  You like him?
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:23.520]  Okay, good.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.942]  Are we going to take down the statue?
[01:14:24.942 --> 01:14:26.883]  Because he was a major slave owner.
[01:14:26.883 --> 01:14:28.365]  Now are we going to take down his statue?
[01:14:29.225 --> 01:14:30.086]  So you know what?
[01:14:30.086 --> 01:14:30.887]  It's fine.
[01:14:30.887 --> 01:14:40.418]  You're changing history, you're changing culture, and you had people, and I'm not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally.
[01:14:40.418 --> 01:14:46.605]  But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay?
[01:14:46.605 --> 01:14:47.906]  And the press has treated them
[01:14:48.587 --> 01:14:50.308]  Absolutely unfairly.
[01:14:50.308 --> 01:15:03.093]  Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers, and you see them come with the black outfits, and with the helmets, and with the baseball bats.
[01:15:03.093 --> 01:15:08.335]  You had a lot of bad people in the other group too.
[01:15:08.335 --> 01:15:11.897]  You were saying the press has treated white nationalists unfairly?
[01:15:11.897 --> 01:15:15.418]  There were people in that rally, and I looked the night before.
[01:15:15.418 --> 01:15:17.399]  If you look, there were people
[01:15:18.382 --> 01:15:26.187]  Protesting, very quietly, the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee.
[01:15:26.187 --> 01:15:27.808]  I'm sure in that group there were some bad ones.
[01:15:27.808 --> 01:15:32.671]  The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people.
[01:15:32.671 --> 01:15:36.853]  Neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them.
[01:15:36.853 --> 01:15:43.518]  But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest, and very legally protest, because you know, I don't know if you know,
[01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:47.839]  They had a permit, the other group didn't have a permit.
[01:15:47.839 --> 01:15:52.661]  So I only tell you this, there are two sides to a story.
[01:15:52.661 --> 01:15:58.865]  I thought what took place was a horrible moment for our country, a horrible moment.
[01:15:58.865 --> 01:16:00.446]  But there are two sides to the country.
[01:16:00.446 --> 01:16:01.786]  Does anybody have a final?
[01:16:03.277 --> 01:16:12.460]  It's amazing because the media never gave Antifa proper credit for the violence in Charlottesville, the stopping of free speech in Charlottesville.
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:19.702]  They never gave Antifa proper credit when they disrupted Trump rallies, when they were staging terror attacks to disrupt J20.
[01:16:19.702 --> 01:16:27.885]  The media never gave the Democrats proper credit when they had Bob Kramer, Scott Fovill, and Aaron Black on the streets instigating violence.
[01:16:27.885 --> 01:16:29.565]  They never gave them any credit then.
[01:16:29.565 --> 01:16:32.066]  But now all of a sudden you'll see the media gives Antifa credit
[01:16:33.419 --> 01:16:35.379]  As fighting racism.
[01:16:35.379 --> 01:16:38.760]  And there's the battle that they have staged for us.
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:41.941]  Steve Pucinich joins us today.
[01:16:41.941 --> 01:16:44.021]  You've got the chessboard behind you today.
[01:16:44.021 --> 01:16:50.423]  I think that that is very symbolic of where we stand in the fight for America right now.
[01:16:50.423 --> 01:16:55.424]  How they're trying to move racism around to put us in checkmate.
[01:16:55.424 --> 01:16:56.504]  Let me put it this way.
[01:16:57.429 --> 01:16:59.290]  I'm not surprised this occurred.
[01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:07.716]  This is something we talked about a year ago, so I said there would be groups that would be pitted against us.
[01:17:07.716 --> 01:17:10.038]  Now, who's us and who's they?
[01:17:10.038 --> 01:17:13.741]  Number one, Richard Spencer grew up in Boston.
[01:17:13.741 --> 01:17:26.410]  His father is an ophthalmologist, went to all these private schools and colleges, never worked a day in his life, and he becomes, quote, the head of the Nazi party, or whatever you want to call it, the alternative right.
[01:17:27.108 --> 01:17:31.031]  This is a man who contrived the history that he belongs to Montana.
[01:17:31.031 --> 01:17:32.451]  I've lived in Montana.
[01:17:32.451 --> 01:17:34.853]  We don't particularly like him in Montana.
[01:17:34.853 --> 01:17:36.234]  His mother spoiled him.
[01:17:36.234 --> 01:17:37.895]  His father spoiled him.
[01:17:37.895 --> 01:17:39.556]  And then he creates, quote, a group.
[01:17:39.556 --> 01:17:41.197]  He's never worked a day in his life.
[01:17:41.197 --> 01:17:44.579]  He has no idea of what a daily worker's about.
[01:17:44.579 --> 01:17:47.841]  And he tried to come here, University of Florida in Gainesville.
[01:17:47.841 --> 01:17:50.103]  I stopped him and a bunch of other people stopped him.
[01:17:50.843 --> 01:17:55.628]  So, we have these intellectuals on the left, so to speak, and on the right.
[01:17:55.628 --> 01:18:01.834]  On the left, I have Singer, a Jewish kid, went to the University of Virginia.
[01:18:01.834 --> 01:18:03.856]  Both of them went to the University of Virginia.
[01:18:03.856 --> 01:18:05.417]  Both intellectuals.
[01:18:05.417 --> 01:18:14.886]  None of them have ever been in anything other than what they want, which is self-aggrandizement, that increased narcissism, and make themselves prominent.
[01:18:15.586 --> 01:18:19.031]  Spencer didn't do anything in his life that's worthy of anything.
[01:18:19.031 --> 01:18:20.893]  He's a spoiled little brat.
[01:18:20.893 --> 01:18:28.063]  And Signor is a spoiled little brat who wants to go to Politics and Prose on Connecticut Avenue and teach nonfiction.
[01:18:28.063 --> 01:18:30.406]  So you have these two spoiled little
[01:18:30.486 --> 01:18:35.330]  First of all, neither one understands what the Nazi rally was about.
[01:18:52.826 --> 01:18:59.190]  Secondly, most of them don't understand that Hitler really had about 100,000 Jews in his army.
[01:18:59.190 --> 01:19:01.272]  Now, I didn't make this up.
[01:19:01.272 --> 01:19:08.977]  Hitler's two major field commanders and the Luftwaffe, the Blitzkrieg, were full Jews out of five.
[01:19:09.918 --> 01:19:18.450]  Hitler's right-hand man, Heidrich, who was in charge of the extermination of Jews, was a Jew from Austria.
[01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:21.635]  So history is missing in all of this.
[01:19:21.635 --> 01:19:24.680]  On the left, they forgot that they gave birth
[01:19:25.236 --> 01:19:28.999]  We'll be right back with more on the Alex Jones Show!
[01:19:55.225 --> 01:19:56.105]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:19:56.105 --> 01:19:58.486]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:19:58.486 --> 01:20:06.527]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[01:20:06.527 --> 01:20:08.447]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:20:08.447 --> 01:20:12.108]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[01:20:12.108 --> 01:20:16.769]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.

[01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:21.810]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:34.455]  You want to save money in a place that gives you growth, control, and certainty without stock market risk or tax risk, and you want guarantees, and you want it all tax-free.
[01:20:34.455 --> 01:20:35.676]  That's a tall order.
[01:20:35.676 --> 01:20:40.398]  But you can get all of that with properly designed participating whole life insurance.
[01:20:40.398 --> 01:20:43.259]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[01:20:43.259 --> 01:20:44.100]  That's true.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:48.602]  But you can have tax-free access to use your life insurance while you're alive.
[01:20:48.602 --> 01:20:50.863]  Get the free book to find out how.
[01:20:50.863 --> 01:20:51.163]  Call 702-660-7000.
[01:20:54.505 --> 01:20:56.185]  Do you trust our economy?
[01:20:56.185 --> 01:20:57.886]  How about our banking system?
[01:20:57.886 --> 01:21:05.068]  Our president has stated we are sitting on a bubble right now, and that when the Fed raises interest rates, bad things are going to happen.
[01:21:05.068 --> 01:21:07.449]  Well, the Fed is raising rates here and now.
[01:21:07.449 --> 01:21:15.691]  There has never been a better time to turn your IRA or 401k into physical gold or silver with GSI Exchange.
[01:21:15.691 --> 01:21:18.552]  Call 833-GSI-GOLD.

[01:21:25.014 --> 01:21:26.295]  833-GSI-GOLD.

[01:21:41.807 --> 01:21:43.528]  Call GSI Exchange at 833-GSI-GOLD.

[01:21:54.056 --> 01:21:58.519]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:21:58.519 --> 01:22:00.100]  Those times may be near.
[01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:01.020]  Think about it.
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:05.623]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:22:05.623 --> 01:22:10.266]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:22:10.606 --> 01:22:16.412]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:22:16.412 --> 01:22:23.138]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:25.681]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:22:26.121 --> 01:22:28.923]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.
[01:22:28.923 --> 01:22:31.425]  Get a four-week survival food supply for only $99.

[01:22:53.559 --> 01:22:59.423]  If you had purchased $100 of Bitcoin in 2010, today you'd have $2,600,000.
[01:22:59.423 --> 01:23:05.927]  While that sinks in, you now have a huge cryptocurrency opportunity at below market price at a guaranteed $0.10 per coin.

[01:23:24.757 --> 01:23:26.038]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:23:26.038 --> 01:23:29.778]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:23:29.778 --> 01:23:30.859]  Forget bunkers.
[01:23:30.859 --> 01:23:32.679]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:23:32.679 --> 01:23:34.399]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:24:04.792 --> 01:24:07.075]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:09.719]  Owen Schroer, Dr. Steve Pucinich with you in this segment.
[01:24:09.719 --> 01:24:14.004]  We will be for the remainder of this hour talking about the events in Charlottesville and the truth about them.
[01:24:15.054 --> 01:24:26.758]  And while we're talking about it, you might want to get to Infowarsstore.com because we have the BuzzFeed Mega Special going on right now, but this is going to be ending soon because we're selling out of these products.
[01:24:26.758 --> 01:24:29.939]  So we can't have the special if we don't have any products to sell you.

[01:25:39.554 --> 01:25:43.275]  So you are supporting us, you're taking advantage of the Mega Special, but if you haven't yet,

[01:25:50.496 --> 01:25:55.817]  Infowarsstore.com, BuzzFeed Mega Special, limited time, free shipping as well.
[01:25:55.817 --> 01:26:06.560]  Take advantage of all of those great offers and fund independent media that gets people like Dr. Steve Pachenik on to break down the, I would say, collusion.
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:11.501]  I would say behind-the-door collusion between the mayor of Charlottesville and Richard Spencer.
[01:26:11.501 --> 01:26:13.261]  Dr. Pachenik, where you left off?
[01:26:14.824 --> 01:26:15.766]  I would agree with you.
[01:26:15.766 --> 01:26:17.348]  There is a clear collusion.
[01:26:17.348 --> 01:26:21.094]  Both of the men were trained in the same place as the University of Virginia.
[01:26:21.094 --> 01:26:23.658]  They're both highly educated.
[01:26:23.658 --> 01:26:28.346]  They both owe their allegiance to their specific
[01:26:29.322 --> 01:26:31.623]  Parties in the case of Spencer.
[01:26:31.623 --> 01:26:38.246]  He just made up some nonsensical party called the Nazis or the alternative right or alternative media.
[01:26:38.246 --> 01:26:41.687]  He didn't create the expression alternative media.
[01:26:41.687 --> 01:26:45.769]  Neither did Hillary was really created here on the Alex Jones Show when we did it about
[01:26:46.710 --> 01:26:53.456]  12-14 years ago where we were the new right or the new Republicans because we broke away on 9-11.
[01:26:53.456 --> 01:26:55.217]  That's what nobody really understood.
[01:26:55.217 --> 01:27:07.488]  This is a still carryover in terms of the Republican Party or we who were disillusioned with the Bushes and others that we wanted to have our own specific party and Alex was the forefront of it.
[01:27:07.968 --> 01:27:11.249]  In terms of the left, I mean, they have been pathetic.
[01:27:11.249 --> 01:27:13.610]  It's still part of the Podesta group.
[01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:16.491]  It's still part of the, you know, the fascism of the left.
[01:27:16.491 --> 01:27:25.255]  When you create a tight group and they're always working to create agitation propaganda, that's the beginning of fascism on both sides.
[01:27:25.255 --> 01:27:28.596]  And probably the closest analogy historically to this
[01:27:29.156 --> 01:27:43.304]  Would be the Weimar Republic in the 1920s when you had the fascist left and the so-called fascist right coming together and in between you had this painter or a theoretical painter who didn't get into our school named Hitler who came to power.
[01:27:43.304 --> 01:27:45.246]  Now, this is highly contrived.
[01:27:45.246 --> 01:27:51.969]  Whoever's involved has to be involved with some of the elements of the FBI and some of the elements of the CIA.
[01:27:51.969 --> 01:27:52.830]  Why do I say that?
[01:27:53.416 --> 01:27:55.777]  Richard Spencer lives in Arlington, Virginia.
[01:27:55.777 --> 01:27:59.339]  He was married to a former Russian or Russian-American.
[01:27:59.339 --> 01:28:02.260]  The Russian-American, it turns out, studied U.S.
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:05.401]  foreign policy, international relations, and guess what?
[01:28:05.401 --> 01:28:06.762]  The Soviet Union.
[01:28:06.762 --> 01:28:10.524]  By definition, she was and still is probably the CIA.
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:17.706]  In return, you have Podesta Group, you've got Signor, as he calls himself.
[01:28:17.706 --> 01:28:23.792]  He was involved in a lot of education as well, University of Virginia, as was Spencer.
[01:28:23.792 --> 01:28:35.644]  So both come out of the same background, intellectual, spoiled, elitist, none of them have ever really worked, none of them created a job, and both decided to get into the business of agitation
[01:28:38.291 --> 01:28:41.955]  The FBI has completely penetrated the KKK.
[01:28:41.955 --> 01:28:44.277]  There's no notion there is any KKK.
[01:28:44.277 --> 01:28:46.459]  As usual, Alex is correct.
[01:28:46.459 --> 01:28:56.890]  Years ago, I remember Maurice Deese of the Southern Poverty Law Center, whom I helped out about 20-30 years ago and gave him some operatives and some money.
[01:28:57.310 --> 01:29:01.974]  To tell them to infiltrate it and also we told the FBI to get rid of the KKK.
[01:29:01.974 --> 01:29:11.461]  So the KKK doesn't exist and as Alex pointed out the absurdity of having a black or brown individual in the KKK makes it even more absurd.
[01:29:11.461 --> 01:29:17.586]  The fact that you have men dressed up in full combat gear walking with planes is also absurd.
[01:29:17.586 --> 01:29:23.651]  So this was all highly contrived by whatever the deep state, the FBI, the agency in order to create
[01:29:24.051 --> 01:29:25.631]  Strategic tension.
[01:29:25.631 --> 01:29:27.832]  Now, Trump handled this very well.
[01:29:27.832 --> 01:29:36.974]  Where the problem lies for Trump is very simply that he's answering all the questions right on the mark, but he's getting trapped in this.
[01:29:36.974 --> 01:29:38.154]  That's Dr. Steve Pucinich.
[01:29:38.154 --> 01:29:44.295]  We'll be right back with more from him, more of the breakdown on Charlottesville, and your phone calls.
[01:29:44.295 --> 01:29:45.696]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.696 --> 01:29:48.236]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.236 --> 01:29:50.917]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:57.570]  Why is the fungus?
[01:29:57.570 --> 01:29:58.651]  Why is the mold?
[01:29:58.651 --> 01:30:00.392]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[01:30:00.392 --> 01:30:01.353]  What is going on?
[01:30:01.353 --> 01:30:02.113]  What has changed?
[01:30:26.409 --> 01:30:27.849]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[01:30:27.849 --> 01:30:28.870]  I want to get your reviews.
[01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:29.810]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:31.270]  For me, it's been incredible.
[01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:35.811]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[01:30:35.811 --> 01:30:36.631]  Get it today.
[01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:37.111]  Limited run.
[01:30:37.111 --> 01:30:38.532]  It'll be months till we get more.
[01:30:38.532 --> 01:30:43.173]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:30:43.173 --> 01:30:46.533]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[01:30:46.533 --> 01:30:48.854]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[01:30:48.854 --> 01:30:50.754]  Look at the response we're getting.
[01:30:50.754 --> 01:30:52.195]  We're changing the world together.
[01:30:52.195 --> 01:30:53.215]  You are the Infowar.
[01:30:53.215 --> 01:30:53.915]  God bless you all.
[01:30:55.791 --> 01:30:59.794]  A new shipment of Bio-True Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:30:59.794 --> 01:31:01.275]  We've been sold out for months.
[01:31:01.275 --> 01:31:06.338]  Our one-of-a-kind Infowarslife Bio-True Selenium formula is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:06.338 --> 01:31:10.481]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[01:31:10.481 --> 01:31:15.024]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[01:31:15.024 --> 01:31:20.168]  But Bio-True Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:31:20.168 --> 01:31:23.430]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[01:31:23.630 --> 01:31:35.880]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight, BioTrue Selenium is also the perfect supercharger to Survival Shield XT Basin Iodine, as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.

[01:33:03.004 --> 01:33:07.807]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[01:33:07.807 --> 01:33:11.249]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:11.249 --> 01:33:14.910]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:18.432]  This program, along with Dr. Steve Purchenick, has been telling you for years...
[01:33:19.693 --> 01:33:27.695]  That the deep state, the globalists, and the left are going to try to set up and stage events and blame patriots in order to start a civil war and destroy this country.
[01:33:27.695 --> 01:33:30.716]  Dr. Steve Pucinich has broken this down in the previous segments.
[01:33:30.716 --> 01:33:33.896]  He's wrote about it on his website, stevepucinich.com.
[01:33:33.896 --> 01:33:35.497]  Charlottesville stage confrontation.
[01:33:35.497 --> 01:33:43.539]  He broke down the collusion with Michael Signer and Richard Spencer, a professional LARPer by my estimation.
[01:33:43.539 --> 01:33:46.279]  But I want to hear your take on a couple other angles, Dr. Pucinich.
[01:33:46.279 --> 01:33:48.760]  Three angles I want to hear your take on.
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:48.860]  One,
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:54.022]  What happened to the police helicopter and how come nobody is asking that question?
[01:33:54.022 --> 01:33:55.603]  No coverage on that.
[01:33:55.603 --> 01:34:02.687]  Two, what do you think about the people that attacked the car that ended up driving over people and killing one woman?
[01:34:02.687 --> 01:34:12.832]  And what do you think about the car driver able to speed out of there in a jiffy like a professional driver and get out of the scene and then police are able to apprehend him later?
[01:34:12.832 --> 01:34:14.753]  Let's start with the police helicopter.
[01:34:14.753 --> 01:34:16.034]  What are your thoughts on that?
[01:34:17.392 --> 01:34:18.873]  I really don't know.
[01:34:18.873 --> 01:34:29.137]  What I do know is that beforehand I was shocked that there was no police protection for anybody, either on the right or the left.
[01:34:29.137 --> 01:34:30.217]  This was a trap.
[01:34:30.217 --> 01:34:32.418]  There was no question this was a setup.
[01:34:32.418 --> 01:34:34.279]  This should have been seen very quickly.
[01:34:34.899 --> 01:34:49.257]  By whoever the marchers were, particularly on the alternative right or Spencer, they didn't pick this up and they should have picked it up because there was no police protection as they came in and then they were shuttled into a barricade.
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:56.762]  The second issue about the car or, you know, the helicopter, I really do not know what happened.
[01:34:56.762 --> 01:34:57.543]  I'm sorry.
[01:34:57.543 --> 01:35:00.424]  I mean, I know UVA police.
[01:35:00.424 --> 01:35:01.704]  Some of them are very good.
[01:35:01.704 --> 01:35:04.705]  Some of them are, you know, they do their job.
[01:35:04.705 --> 01:35:15.049]  Virginia tends to have a very strict moral code and a very strict system of operation for their state troopers and all of their policemen.
[01:35:15.049 --> 01:35:15.989]  So they're well trained.
[01:35:16.509 --> 01:35:20.550]  As for the Charlottesville police, I have no idea why they were not there.
[01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:24.291]  Most probably the mayor told them not to be there.
[01:35:24.291 --> 01:35:38.415]  And if I know Terry McAuliffe, who's been the political slimebag since he's been with the Clintons for over 20 years, there's no question in my mind that he was part of this setup in order to create the confrontation that he needed.
[01:35:38.935 --> 01:35:41.617]  It's an old intelligence technique, but it's not working that well.
[01:35:55.820 --> 01:35:59.743]  In terms of the driver, they said he was schizophrenic.
[01:35:59.743 --> 01:36:01.404]  They said he was on medication.
[01:36:01.404 --> 01:36:07.187]  I'm a little bit surprised that he was brought into the Army, given the fact he was schizophrenic.
[01:36:07.187 --> 01:36:10.689]  I'm not surprised the Army threw him out within four months.
[01:36:10.689 --> 01:36:16.173]  And then he immediately went to whatever organization that he said he was pro-Nazi.
[01:36:17.333 --> 01:36:22.496]  Most people have no idea what the Nazis really were, who they were and how they fought.
[01:36:22.496 --> 01:36:30.079]  It just sounds great and they have no idea what the underlying basis was for National Socialism.
[01:36:30.079 --> 01:36:37.282]  If he's crazy, then I think he should be evaluated and then he should be either placed in a psychiatric hospital
[01:36:38.022 --> 01:36:43.948]  Which I would not recommend since I would say he was quite sane according to the McNaughton ruling.
[01:36:43.948 --> 01:36:50.775]  In other words, he knew exactly what he was doing and he should be prosecuted accordingly and trialed for murder.
[01:36:50.775 --> 01:36:55.279]  And whether you want to call it terrorism or intentional murder, there's no question in my mind.
[01:36:56.610 --> 01:37:05.323]  As a result, the prosecution on a federal level has to be consistent with intentional murder and no mitigating circumstance.
[01:37:05.323 --> 01:37:07.787]  I do not say he was a schizophrenic at that point.
[01:37:08.524 --> 01:37:16.734]  I completely agree, and it's pretty obvious that anybody in their right mind would completely condemn a psychopath mauling people down in a car.
[01:37:16.734 --> 01:37:24.082]  But I'm just curious, how come there's been no talk in the media or anyone about the people that were beating his car, the people that were hitting his car with bats?
[01:37:24.082 --> 01:37:28.628]  I mean, this is the kind of thing that, if we don't stop that, you could have another similar incident.
[01:37:30.006 --> 01:37:42.381]  Well, what you've got here, with all due respect, when we start getting into the weeds of the garden, what you're finding out is this is just the small elements of agitation propaganda.
[01:37:42.381 --> 01:37:43.863]  It doesn't matter.
[01:37:43.863 --> 01:37:48.529]  Once the confrontation occurs and once there's a decision to have these two
[01:37:48.649 --> 01:37:49.009]  I think?
[01:38:12.262 --> 01:38:18.427]  Again, I mean, he's very much of a kind of elitist pansy type, exactly like Richard Spencer.
[01:38:18.427 --> 01:38:20.609]  These are not people who are serious.
[01:38:20.609 --> 01:38:22.410]  Will it happen again?
[01:38:22.410 --> 01:38:32.138]  Maybe, but I'll give you one idea that here in the University of Florida in Gainesville, we just turned down Spencer's request to say that he wants to talk about free speech.
[01:38:32.138 --> 01:38:33.759]  This is not about free speech.
[01:38:33.759 --> 01:38:37.442]  Contrary to what anybody thought, this is about agitation propaganda.
[01:38:38.022 --> 01:38:43.125]  So the First Amendment does not apply either to the alternative left or the alternative right.
[01:38:43.125 --> 01:38:51.829]  When you're intending to come into an agitation, propaganda, and confrontation, there's no lawyer in the world that could rationalize that this is free speech.
[01:38:51.829 --> 01:38:52.789]  It's just not.
[01:38:52.789 --> 01:38:54.190]  And you know what's going to happen?
[01:38:54.190 --> 01:39:02.394]  The ACLU is going to come in and probably say that, how dare you not let Richard Spencer have his speech, because that's what they did over the weekend in Charlottesville.
[01:39:03.342 --> 01:39:04.503]  That's fine.
[01:39:04.503 --> 01:39:06.504]  I funded the ACLU.
[01:39:06.504 --> 01:39:10.746]  I don't think they're necessarily the most sophisticated organization.
[01:39:10.746 --> 01:39:17.189]  I don't think they really understand anything in the intelligence world in terms of agitation propaganda.
[01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:19.571]  They don't understand denial distraction.
[01:39:19.571 --> 01:39:23.653]  They work on a judicial system which may not be relevant to today's times.
[01:39:24.773 --> 01:39:34.877]  And I, you know, I respect what they've done in the past, but I don't necessarily agree that premeditated confrontation is the right to speech, and that's not a First Amendment right.
[01:39:34.877 --> 01:39:40.999]  And this is how they're trying to stage the Civil War, at least in my opinion, to clash these two groups against one another.
[01:39:40.999 --> 01:39:44.620]  We're now joined also by Alex Jones, so Dr. Steve Pachetnik on the line.
[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:45.621]  Alex Jones with us now.
[01:39:45.621 --> 01:39:48.142]  I'm Owen Troyer, kind of playing traffic cop here.
[01:39:48.142 --> 01:39:49.162]  Alex, welcome back to the program.
[01:39:50.433 --> 01:39:50.753]  You bet.
[01:39:50.753 --> 01:39:55.736]  I'm on a working vacation, but actually out here working on several things while I'm in Seattle with some family.
[01:39:55.736 --> 01:39:58.117]  But I was going to go on a hike here in a few minutes.
[01:39:58.117 --> 01:39:59.818]  That's why I'm in my regular t-shirt.
[01:39:59.818 --> 01:40:05.641]  But I was getting in the car to drive to the mountain, and I'm listening to you guys on the iPhone app.
[01:40:05.641 --> 01:40:13.825]  And what Dr. Patrick was saying was so important, I pulled back up and back up in the hotel because I have to know the history of the WTO because I had a reporter out here at the time.
[01:40:13.825 --> 01:40:18.748]  I bought a bunch of the raw footage from the 1999 demonstration against the WTO.
[01:40:20.387 --> 01:40:25.754]  That was back when the left was halfway against globalism and unelected groups taking over.
[01:40:25.754 --> 01:40:33.843]  But that so concerned the globalists, they spent all this money coming in to take it over and then to start branding it in 2000 as racist.
[01:40:33.843 --> 01:40:37.308]  So they began to fund the white supremacist groups and others that have been well known.
[01:40:38.028 --> 01:40:52.386]  Even Texas Monthly has written cover page articles about the FBI creating fake Klan groups, as Dr. Petrenko was saying, intelligence agencies setting them up, Oklahoma City using German intelligence, Southern Poverty Law Center, it goes on and on.
[01:40:52.386 --> 01:40:56.672]  But there I am yesterday in Seattle, down on the waterfront,
[01:40:57.532 --> 01:40:58.512]  Thank you for having me.
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:21.702]  By a listener, but a smaller handbill size, back in 1999.
[01:41:21.702 --> 01:41:24.162]  But I was actually able to buy the one of a kind they had.
[01:41:24.162 --> 01:41:26.103]  They said, yeah, nobody ever even wanted it.
[01:41:26.103 --> 01:41:31.165]  Stopped the WTO, and here it is.
[01:41:31.165 --> 01:41:36.246]  And it says right there, add your prop.
[01:41:36.246 --> 01:41:37.527]  And it talks about what they were doing.
[01:41:39.497 --> 01:41:44.980]  Peaceful people out here peacefully demonstrating against the World Trade Organization transferring our sovereignty.
[01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:46.241]  And they can't have that.
[01:41:46.241 --> 01:41:55.427]  So then they posed 50 people who were government house protected, trained in Oregon by big foundations to come in, be violent, attack police.
[01:41:55.427 --> 01:41:56.688]  The police stand down.
[01:41:56.688 --> 01:42:00.570]  Then they come in the next day, attack the peaceful crowds because the public had already seen that.
[01:42:00.570 --> 01:42:01.851]  And that's the standard deal.
[01:42:01.851 --> 01:42:06.374]  And you heard what he was exposing with Spencer and the guy's wife and the whole background.
[01:42:06.374 --> 01:42:07.655]  It's all complete cutouts.
[01:42:08.215 --> 01:42:09.856]  They don't even try to hide any of this stuff.
[01:42:09.856 --> 01:42:16.337]  And this is Steve Pucinich who ran the psychological operations, you know, the Camp David Accords back when he was younger and all those other things.
[01:42:16.337 --> 01:42:19.398]  This is a real player telling folks this is going on.
[01:42:19.398 --> 01:42:25.820]  So I want him to briefly speak about the players now he thinks that are involved and what he thinks they're going to hit us with next.
[01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:29.601]  Because they won't let Trump bring us together around the economy or anything.
[01:42:29.601 --> 01:42:30.981]  They just keep hammering.
[01:42:30.981 --> 01:42:32.342]  A lot of folks aren't buying it.
[01:42:32.342 --> 01:42:35.643]  So they're using fake polls again to make it sound like he's losing
[01:42:36.583 --> 01:42:40.705]  Steam, but I had to come back because people don't know what Agiprop and all this is.
[01:42:40.705 --> 01:42:43.347]  They don't understand that this is really going on.
[01:42:43.347 --> 01:42:45.728]  It's what they train universities for.
[01:42:45.728 --> 01:42:48.270]  Even the low-level people involved know they're involved.
[01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:53.793]  They're almost all doctorate students recruited in by foundations as front groups.
[01:42:53.793 --> 01:42:55.814]  And the public needs to understand that when I say
[01:42:56.454 --> 01:43:00.299]  They caught leftist Jewish individuals attacking synagogues this year to blame Trump.
[01:43:00.299 --> 01:43:01.060]  They got caught.
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:02.422]  It was in the Washington Post.
[01:43:02.422 --> 01:43:03.543]  But no one gives it coverage.
[01:43:03.543 --> 01:43:10.632]  Or when they catch leftist groups doing it, they just try to spin it, hoping we're all ignorant, but less and less it's working.
[01:43:12.034 --> 01:43:14.175]  Alex, as usual, you're right on the button and so is Owen.
[01:43:14.175 --> 01:43:17.537]  What agitation propaganda is, it's an old technique that we've used for centuries, actually.
[01:43:17.537 --> 01:43:19.278]  The Germans used it, the Russians used it.
[01:43:40.869 --> 01:43:43.573]  Everybody uses it in order to create a distraction.
[01:43:43.573 --> 01:43:48.359]  I mean, you have Trotsky, you have Lenin.
[01:43:48.359 --> 01:43:50.361]  Lenin's right-hand man was Trotsky.
[01:43:50.361 --> 01:43:52.064]  What was he famous for?
[01:43:52.064 --> 01:43:57.010]  He was famous for coming in, creating agitation, and then making sure that the two elements
[01:43:57.389 --> 01:44:06.018]  The White Russians, the Soviets would attack each other and therefore they could neutralize both of them and eventually take over as the Communist Party.
[01:44:06.018 --> 01:44:09.922]  Trotsky's mistake was... Fish in the James Bond from Russia with love.
[01:44:09.922 --> 01:44:16.469]  It's like the fish, where they get the two Siamese fighting fish to almost kill each other, then the one's almost dead and the new one can come in and take him out.
[01:44:17.398 --> 01:44:19.179]  Again, Alex hit it on the head.
[01:44:19.179 --> 01:44:25.161]  One of the reasons I always love to come on the show is because Alex knows a lot and he doesn't reveal it, but it's true.
[01:44:25.161 --> 01:44:36.706]  But like the Russians and like Trotsky, what happened to Trotsky was he insulted Stalin and then Stalin had a retribution, which was an axe in Trotsky's head.
[01:44:37.666 --> 01:44:45.111]  This is exactly what will happen to Spencer, this will happen to Signor, and this will happen to the individuals who are involved.
[01:44:45.111 --> 01:44:46.952]  The reason for that is very simple.
[01:44:46.952 --> 01:45:01.361]  Those of us who know the deep state, who know everything about agitprop, we know exactly how it's created, where it comes from, who's funding it, we'll make sure that these leaders, and this is a warning to them, and I have rarely missed my warnings,
[01:45:01.741 --> 01:45:08.487]  That they are in trouble, they are in danger now of being killed by their very own people who set them up.
[01:45:08.487 --> 01:45:16.093]  Whether it's the FBI, the CIA, whatever foundations you want to talk about, they will not be able to continue.
[01:45:16.093 --> 01:45:17.355]  Now why do I say this?
[01:45:17.355 --> 01:45:23.520]  Because when Spencer went up to Montana, and Montana he went to is a very elegant, rich area, white fish.
[01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:27.062]  Where you go sailing, you go fishing.
[01:45:27.062 --> 01:45:29.164]  He didn't go into Montana to work.
[01:45:29.164 --> 01:45:31.625]  He didn't work a day in the lumber camps.
[01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:33.787]  He never worked a day creating a business.
[01:45:33.787 --> 01:45:35.628]  I had four businesses in Montana.
[01:45:35.628 --> 01:45:42.393]  This is a spoiled child, literally a child, whose mother got into fights with people in Montana.
[01:45:42.393 --> 01:45:46.796]  And I called up my friends, the conservative republics in Montana, and they say, this is a brat.
[01:45:47.316 --> 01:45:50.438]  And so he was picked up because he is a brat.
[01:45:50.438 --> 01:45:52.060]  He's easily controlled.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:55.442]  He has nothing to do with Semitism, anti-Semitism.
[01:45:55.442 --> 01:45:58.924]  He's just a jerk who has nothing to do and he's lazy.
[01:45:58.924 --> 01:46:00.986]  The same thing with Signer.
[01:46:00.986 --> 01:46:03.127]  Signer is a Jewish kid who's a schlep.
[01:46:03.127 --> 01:46:05.129]  He never worked a day in his life.
[01:46:05.129 --> 01:46:08.071]  He was part of the transition group under Obama.
[01:46:08.071 --> 01:46:16.657]  So what happens is the deep state, some of us come in, we pick each one of these guys, we tell them they're important, we fund the money, and then we say go at each other.
[01:46:17.077 --> 01:46:21.502]  Now, the big difference here is what Alex said and what Trump said.
[01:46:21.502 --> 01:46:24.465]  Number one, let me be clear about our Civil War.
[01:46:24.465 --> 01:46:28.929]  Our Civil War was never, but never about slavery.
[01:46:28.929 --> 01:46:35.997]  It was always about money and the increased domination of the Industrial Revolution in the North.
[01:46:36.617 --> 01:46:38.420]  And we wanted the Missouri River.
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:39.781]  We wanted the Mississippi.
[01:46:39.781 --> 01:46:41.383]  We wanted New Orleans.
[01:46:41.383 --> 01:46:52.417]  Similarly, this new war will not be a civil war because Abraham Lincoln was not that stupid, but he was not that healthy, nor did he care about blacks.
[01:46:52.797 --> 01:46:53.857]  Let me be very clear.
[01:46:53.857 --> 01:46:58.978]  If you look at the statements that Abraham Lincoln made, he said blacks are inferior.
[01:46:58.978 --> 01:47:00.579]  I don't want them in the America.
[01:47:00.579 --> 01:47:03.979]  I want them deposed and sent over to Liberia.
[01:47:03.979 --> 01:47:17.482]  In fact, Lincoln mandated that Maryland, Delaware, Missouri must be slave states in order to make sure the political elite could control the South and then eventually could do what he wanted.
[01:47:18.102 --> 01:47:19.804]  Lincoln had Marfan syndrome.
[01:47:19.804 --> 01:47:21.746]  He was a bipolar individual.
[01:47:21.746 --> 01:47:24.629]  He was totally nasty depressed.
[01:47:24.629 --> 01:47:31.897]  So if you want to go to any statue where a man hated blacks, literally, you look at his statements that he made about blacks.
[01:47:31.897 --> 01:47:32.938]  They were inferior.
[01:47:32.938 --> 01:47:34.540]  They should never come to America.
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:35.901]  We'll send them back to Liberia.
[01:47:35.901 --> 01:47:38.084]  Then take away the Abraham Lincoln monument.
[01:47:38.084 --> 01:47:39.185]  I don't have a problem with that.
[01:47:39.685 --> 01:47:44.930]  I've always resented that I had to have the propaganda from the North that Lincoln was a great president.
[01:47:44.930 --> 01:47:48.172]  He was one of our worst presidents, just like John F. Kennedy.
[01:47:48.172 --> 01:47:49.534]  He was mentally ill.
[01:47:49.534 --> 01:47:53.157]  He had no idea what he wanted, except he was repressive.
[01:47:53.157 --> 01:47:54.618]  He was a fascist.
[01:47:54.618 --> 01:48:01.684]  He arrested all of the judges in Maryland, all of the journalists, and then created auto genocide, where 950,000 boys were killing each other.
[01:48:04.306 --> 01:48:10.348]  Now you tell me that's a great president, and I want to hear the press retaliate with any sense of history.
[01:48:10.348 --> 01:48:12.309]  So what do we have in academia?
[01:48:12.309 --> 01:48:16.311]  We have this notion that Lincoln was one of our greatest presidents.
[01:48:16.311 --> 01:48:19.812]  Absolute nonsense!
[01:48:19.812 --> 01:48:27.675]  Doris Goodwin, who was the writer about Lincoln, was the same woman who seduced LBJ on his biography.
[01:48:28.075 --> 01:48:33.860]  So you have academia involved in the polarization of a country.
[01:48:33.860 --> 01:48:38.363]  You have professors who attain you to have no idea what the history is about.
[01:48:38.363 --> 01:48:42.686]  You have PhD students who continue just propagating nonsense.
[01:48:42.686 --> 01:48:46.549]  And there's no history or basis of facts.
[01:48:46.549 --> 01:48:48.771]  We don't talk about the history of America.
[01:48:48.771 --> 01:48:56.797]  We don't talk about the fact that Lincoln was very close to kind of a Popeye who made sure that we destroyed the entire South
[01:48:57.257 --> 01:49:01.062]  In order to get railroads, in order to get Mississippi, in order to get New Orleans.
[01:49:01.062 --> 01:49:04.265]  He didn't give a damn about the blacks.
[01:49:04.265 --> 01:49:06.168]  We had white slavery coming in.
[01:49:06.168 --> 01:49:10.853]  Ask every Irish family who came in during the 1840s, 50s and 60s.
[01:49:10.853 --> 01:49:14.377]  The first thing the Irish came in for, they were sent into the war.
[01:49:14.377 --> 01:49:17.741]  And if they couldn't buy their way out, they were the real slaves in the North.
[01:49:18.201 --> 01:49:19.843]  Grant had a slave.
[01:49:19.843 --> 01:49:21.085]  Lee had a slave.
[01:49:21.085 --> 01:49:22.386]  I mean, this is absurd.
[01:49:22.386 --> 01:49:28.714]  So the distortion of history as articulated by academia was absurd.
[01:49:28.714 --> 01:49:34.421]  And that was part of the propaganda that I had to learn in the North and disavow when I came to the South.
[01:49:34.961 --> 01:49:38.483]  The South was far more integrated than anybody ever realized.
[01:49:38.483 --> 01:49:44.786]  I'm still living here in the rural South, and I have mixed couples at a far greater rate than I see in the North.
[01:49:44.786 --> 01:49:55.251]  Robert E. Lee was not only the number one student at West Point, he was, as you said, Alex, the superintendent of West Point.
[01:49:55.251 --> 01:50:02.055]  The reason he went into Northern Virginia is because his loyalty was the Patrician family in Virginia, not to the South.
[01:50:02.655 --> 01:50:09.018]  He eventually agreed to be the head commander of all the South, only years after he was in the war.
[01:50:09.018 --> 01:50:12.260]  He was a great tactician, but not a great strategist.
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:23.486]  And in turn, we have Grant, who's portrayed as some kind of alcoholic, who was a brilliant strategist, was an excellent command and control officer, and did exactly what he had to do to fight the war.
[01:50:24.086 --> 01:50:32.772]  And he did it, and eventually became President of the United States because Lincoln was afraid that Grant would become the President and try to subordinate him.
[01:50:32.772 --> 01:50:47.401]  So the history of all of these dynamics is never articulated because our schools don't teach it, our professors don't want to hear it, and basically the New York Times has no idea what they're talking about, neither does the Washington Post.
[01:50:47.401 --> 01:50:50.603]  The first people I hear who are going to have any ideas, I'll always go to Alex.
[01:50:51.712 --> 01:50:53.589]  Alright folks, we'll be right back with more of the Alex Jones Show.

[01:53:01.087 --> 01:53:03.389]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:53:03.389 --> 01:53:07.892]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[01:53:42.788 --> 01:53:44.228]  Or warm and served.

[01:53:46.268 --> 01:53:48.209]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[01:54:05.656 --> 01:54:07.577]  Siamese fighting fish.
[01:54:07.577 --> 01:54:09.678]  Fascinating creatures.
[01:54:09.678 --> 01:54:12.399]  Brave, but on the whole stupid.
[01:54:12.399 --> 01:54:14.880]  Yes, they're stupid.
[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:19.682]  Except for the occasional one such as we have here, who lets the other two fight.
[01:54:19.682 --> 01:54:21.003]  He waits.
[01:54:28.627 --> 01:54:34.331]  Wait until the survivor is so exhausted that he cannot defend himself.
[01:54:34.331 --> 01:54:39.656]  And then, like Spectre, he strikes.
[01:54:39.656 --> 01:54:41.837]  I find the parallel amusing.
[01:54:41.837 --> 01:54:50.944]  Our organization did not arrange for you to come over from the Russians just for amusement, number three.
[01:54:50.944 --> 01:54:51.885]  Come in, Gronsteen.
[01:54:52.688 --> 01:54:57.370]  Sit down, Number 3, while we listen to what Number 5 has devised for us.
[01:54:57.370 --> 01:55:03.133]  I hope Cranston's efforts as Director of Planning will continue to be as successful as his chess.
[01:55:03.133 --> 01:55:04.493]  They will be.
[01:55:04.493 --> 01:55:11.396]  According to your instructions, I've planned for Spectre to steal from the Russians their new lector decoding machine.
[01:55:11.396 --> 01:55:19.900]  For this, we need the services of a female member of the Russian cryptograph section in Turkey, and the help of the British Secret Service.
[01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:22.161]  Naturally, neither the Russians nor the British will be aware,
[01:55:22.776 --> 01:55:25.017]  That they are now working class.
[01:55:25.017 --> 01:55:28.677]  Number three, is your section ready to carry out Kronstein's directives?
[01:55:28.677 --> 01:55:29.678]  Yes, number one.
[01:55:29.678 --> 01:55:32.979]  The operation will be organized according to Kronstein's plan.
[01:55:32.979 --> 01:55:36.559]  I have selected a suitable girl from the Russian consulate in Istanbul.
[01:55:36.559 --> 01:55:41.621]  She's capable, cooperative, and her loyalty to the state is beyond question.
[01:55:41.621 --> 01:55:46.162]  And you're absolutely sure she believes you're still head of operations for Soviet intelligence?
[01:55:46.622 --> 01:55:49.825]  It is most unlikely she would know I'm now working for Spectre.
[01:55:49.825 --> 01:55:54.088]  Moskva has kept my defection secret from everyone but a few members of the Presidium.
[01:55:54.088 --> 01:55:56.390]  For your sake, I hope so.
[01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:59.932]  Kronstein, you are sure this plan is foolproof?
[01:55:59.932 --> 01:56:01.454]  Yes, it is.
[01:56:01.454 --> 01:56:04.416]  Because I have anticipated every possible variation of...
[01:56:06.590 --> 01:56:24.504]  So there's the clip from the James Bond movie where they set up the fish to eat one another and then the third fish comes in and takes it all over and the analogy is that that's essentially the Antifa, the alt-right, alt-left, whatever...
[01:56:25.485 --> 01:56:25.865]  We're good.
[01:56:55.842 --> 01:56:58.706]  Yes, you've been, as usually, very sharp, Owen.
[01:56:58.706 --> 01:57:03.372]  The reason I'm not fazed by any of this, number one, we don't have a civil war.
[01:57:03.372 --> 01:57:06.296]  Number two, Trump understands what's happening.
[01:57:06.296 --> 01:57:10.742]  Number three, if you see the man next to him, that's a famous executive
[01:57:10.822 --> 01:57:11.102]  Thank you.
[01:57:31.748 --> 01:57:37.231]  It's a major national security threat, and the money isn't coming into Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[01:57:37.231 --> 01:57:42.494]  She should be indicted, convicted, and sentenced as an enemy of the state.
[01:57:42.494 --> 01:57:45.415]  Similarly, the problem occurs with Obama.
[01:57:45.415 --> 01:57:49.277]  He has again tried to open up a non-profit organization.
[01:57:49.277 --> 01:57:50.177]  It won't work.
[01:57:50.177 --> 01:57:51.918]  Obama was a failure.
[01:57:51.918 --> 01:57:53.759]  He was a product of the CIA.
[01:57:53.759 --> 01:57:56.701]  His mother was an agent, his grandmother, his grandfather.
[01:57:57.561 --> 01:58:10.651]  Again, the agency fails repeatedly, and this is all before Pompeo, who came in, and also the fact that we put military officers into the White House and in other executive positions.
[01:58:10.651 --> 01:58:12.072]  We will not have a civil war.
[01:58:12.072 --> 01:58:17.036]  The reason for it, as I said before, the civil war was started for economic reasons.
[01:58:17.036 --> 01:58:26.984]  Trump is in no way similar to Abraham Lincoln, who was really Marfan syndrome with major mental problems and severe, severe narcissism.
[01:58:27.504 --> 01:58:31.368]  What happened in the Civil War was economic change from the left.
[01:58:31.368 --> 01:58:33.109]  Dr. Steve Pucinich, DrStevePucinich.com.
[01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:37.152]  We'll be right back with more of The Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:37.152 --> 01:58:40.115]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:45.737 --> 01:58:48.318]  As most do not agree, you developed Living Defense for us.
[01:58:48.318 --> 01:58:49.639]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:58:49.639 --> 01:58:50.840]  Why is this so good?
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:56.142]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:58:56.142 --> 01:59:09.689]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:59:09.689 --> 01:59:11.050]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:13.471]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:59:13.471 --> 01:59:16.032]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:59:16.032 --> 01:59:17.353]  These are all parasites.
[01:59:17.353 --> 01:59:18.454]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:59:18.454 --> 01:59:19.794]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:59:19.794 --> 01:59:24.297]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:59:24.297 --> 01:59:27.458]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:59:27.458 --> 01:59:30.640]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:31.681]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:59:31.681 --> 01:59:33.602]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:33.602 --> 01:59:34.622]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:59:34.622 --> 01:59:37.364]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:59:37.364 --> 01:59:37.464]  And...
[01:59:38.204 --> 01:59:39.245]  You support the broadcast.
[01:59:39.245 --> 01:59:40.587]  Infowarslives.com.
[01:59:40.587 --> 01:59:42.829]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:59:42.829 --> 01:59:49.095]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:59:49.095 --> 01:59:51.697]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:00.551 --> 02:00:07.604]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.604 --> 02:00:10.690]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:00:13.183 --> 02:00:17.464]  Well, the whole weekend was started by LARPers like Richard Spencer, Michael Singer.
[02:00:17.464 --> 02:00:21.165]  That has been broken down by Dr. Steve Pchenik, drstevepchenik.com.
[02:00:21.165 --> 02:00:30.848]  One more segment with us before we go to a brand new airing interview here on the Alex Jones Show with Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos, never aired before here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:30.848 --> 02:00:40.191]  And I'm just wondering when the left, that are coming after all of these quote-unquote racist monuments, are going to call for the removal of Margaret Sanger statues and Robert Byrd statues.
[02:00:40.191 --> 02:00:41.412]  Haven't seen that yet.
[02:00:41.412 --> 02:00:42.552]  Or ask Hillary Clinton to.
[02:00:43.172 --> 02:00:44.773]  Disavow Robert Byrd.
[02:00:44.773 --> 02:00:57.299]  But Dr. Steve Puccini, getting back to what you were saying before the break, reason with me right now and reason with our audience right now why we have not seen any public prosecution of Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
[02:00:57.299 --> 02:01:04.643]  Because the system is afraid to get into a political adversary situation.
[02:01:04.643 --> 02:01:09.606]  Number two, Debbie Wasserman Schultz doesn't have enough money to defend herself.
[02:01:10.305 --> 02:01:15.990]  Number three, there was a transition with the FBI, but eventually the FBI will come down.
[02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:26.901]  It will be a federal prosecution on her for treason, for intentionally misleading our FBI agents, for intentionally lying, and it will come about.
[02:01:26.901 --> 02:01:30.384]  Trump understands what's happening.
[02:01:30.384 --> 02:01:35.729]  The people around Debbie Wasserman Schultz knows that she lied before, as we know with the Bernie Sanders campaign.
[02:01:36.289 --> 02:01:47.733]  But it takes time and, you know, since we've had a transition with the FBI and Comey, there will be people in place to prosecute her and eventually to prosecute others who are involved with her.
[02:01:47.733 --> 02:01:53.536]  And the Pakistani brothers will be brought back from Pakistan and indicted and convicted.
[02:01:53.536 --> 02:01:56.657]  How much control does Wray have over the FBI right now?
[02:01:58.516 --> 02:02:06.143]  Almost none, because the FBI, look, it was created by a man who was a drag queen.
[02:02:06.143 --> 02:02:07.184]  I mean, think about it.
[02:02:07.184 --> 02:02:11.668]  Which organization was created by an American drag queen like J. Edgar Hoover?
[02:02:11.668 --> 02:02:15.512]  And then they try to sustain a credibility throughout the next 40, 50 years.
[02:02:16.773 --> 02:02:18.154]  I've worked with the FBI.
[02:02:18.154 --> 02:02:22.217]  I mean, there's some good guys, some bad guys, but overall, they're dysfunctional.
[02:02:22.217 --> 02:02:23.618]  They've always been dysfunctional.
[02:02:23.618 --> 02:02:25.619]  It started with the Hanafi Muslim.
[02:02:25.619 --> 02:02:29.481]  They couldn't do anything, and then they make protestations.
[02:02:29.481 --> 02:02:31.503]  But basically, I eliminate them.
[02:02:31.503 --> 02:02:34.645]  They're useless in many ways, like the CIA.
[02:02:34.645 --> 02:02:39.148]  The military is far more effective than DIA and other branches of our intelligence.
[02:02:39.787 --> 02:02:46.879]  You've been calling out the gaslighting in the media to try to invoke President Trump to do something drastic or rash.
[02:02:46.879 --> 02:02:52.408]  Do you think his response with the press conference yesterday was the track in the right direction?
[02:02:53.180 --> 02:02:56.941]  Yes, I think Trump, as Alex said, is very smart.
[02:02:56.941 --> 02:02:58.322]  He's very bright.
[02:02:58.322 --> 02:03:00.322]  He knows exactly how to handle this.
[02:03:00.322 --> 02:03:07.885]  What he's doing, basically, is he's creating a distraction away from what we've been doing in Raqqa and Mosul.
[02:03:07.885 --> 02:03:10.525]  And basically, we've had success on the military ground.
[02:03:10.525 --> 02:03:16.587]  We've had success in North Korea, as I said we would, and we will have success on the infrastructure.
[02:03:16.587 --> 02:03:18.608]  Once the infrastructure projects come in,
[02:03:19.428 --> 02:03:22.510]  And the Goldman Sachs boys are going to be in charge of this.
[02:03:22.510 --> 02:03:25.531]  And Blackstone, the head of it, Schwarzman will be in charge.
[02:03:25.531 --> 02:03:28.672]  You're going to see the Democratic Party basically implode.
[02:03:28.672 --> 02:03:29.413]  And they know that.
[02:03:29.413 --> 02:03:31.934]  This is the end of their existence.
[02:03:31.934 --> 02:03:39.257]  Once the tax cuts come in and the infrastructure projects come in, Schwarzman has basically sealed their death sentence.
[02:03:39.257 --> 02:03:43.779]  And so you will not see the alternative left being all that functional.
[02:03:43.779 --> 02:03:45.059]  This is not a civil war.
[02:03:45.059 --> 02:03:46.340]  This is just a distraction.
[02:03:46.801 --> 02:03:54.495]  So what do you think desperate Democrats will do here, final 60 seconds of the segment, as they prepare for their ultimate death?
[02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:56.971]  Well, they're gonna just scream.
[02:03:56.971 --> 02:04:07.338]  What happens when you're a dying animal is you just squeal, and Maxine Waters, who's as dumb as they come, you know, just make more stupid statements and go to a four million dollar chateau.
[02:04:07.338 --> 02:04:09.240]  But basically, they're not relevant.
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:15.003]  They know it's the end of their lifestyle, and they will make all kinds of ridiculous things.
[02:04:15.003 --> 02:04:16.164]  Nobody cares.
[02:04:16.164 --> 02:04:19.807]  That's Dr. Steve Pachinick, as usual, analysis spot on.
[02:04:19.807 --> 02:04:21.068]  Thank you for joining us today, Doctor.
[02:04:21.068 --> 02:04:22.809]  Thank you, Owen, and thank everyone else.
[02:04:23.089 --> 02:04:24.650]  There goes Dr. Steve Pchenik, folks.
[02:04:24.650 --> 02:04:30.634]  He's always accurate, spot on with his analysis, and pointing us in the right direction of where to look with the big news.
[02:04:30.634 --> 02:04:35.377]  When we come back, we will have the Milo Yiannopoulos interview with Alex Jones.
[02:04:35.377 --> 02:04:39.860]  Has not been aired yet on the Alex Jones Show, so we will air that in the next segment.
[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:40.380]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:53.731]  Why is the fungus?
[02:04:53.731 --> 02:04:54.812]  Why is the mold?
[02:04:54.812 --> 02:04:56.553]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[02:04:56.553 --> 02:04:57.514]  What is going on?
[02:04:57.514 --> 02:04:58.274]  What has changed?
[02:05:22.570 --> 02:05:24.010]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[02:05:24.010 --> 02:05:25.030]  I want to get your reviews.
[02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.991]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[02:05:25.991 --> 02:05:27.431]  For me, it's been incredible.
[02:05:27.431 --> 02:05:31.972]  MycoZX, anti-fungal, anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[02:05:31.972 --> 02:05:32.792]  Get it today.
[02:05:32.792 --> 02:05:33.272]  Limited run.
[02:05:33.272 --> 02:05:34.692]  It'll be months till we get more.
[02:05:34.692 --> 02:05:39.333]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:05:39.333 --> 02:05:42.694]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[02:05:42.694 --> 02:05:45.014]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[02:05:45.014 --> 02:05:46.434]  Look at the response we're getting.
[02:05:46.434 --> 02:05:48.355]  We're changing the world together.
[02:05:48.355 --> 02:05:49.375]  You are the Infowar.
[02:05:49.375 --> 02:05:50.115]  God bless you all.
[02:05:52.185 --> 02:05:57.649]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride Toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:05:57.649 --> 02:05:59.731]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:05:59.731 --> 02:06:05.034]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:06:05.034 --> 02:06:08.537]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[02:06:08.877 --> 02:06:12.318]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:06:12.318 --> 02:06:15.498]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:06:15.498 --> 02:06:19.379]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:06:19.379 --> 02:06:26.541]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:06:26.541 --> 02:06:32.662]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[02:06:32.862 --> 02:06:34.243]  Nanosilver and more.
[02:06:34.243 --> 02:06:42.546]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue that is Spearmint-free.
[02:06:42.546 --> 02:06:50.849]  Learn more about the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.

[02:07:51.041 --> 02:07:54.905]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:54.905 --> 02:07:57.568]  Because there is a war on.
[02:07:57.568 --> 02:07:58.649]  Or you're mine.
[02:08:11.807 --> 02:08:20.021]  I say provocative and outrageous things in order to demonstrate that the American media isn't really interested in the truth.
[02:08:20.021 --> 02:08:25.349]  I'm going with my instincts, I'm going with my guts, I'm going with who I am, my essence, with truth!
[02:08:29.082 --> 02:08:40.471]  Now, you and I have something in common, which is that we blend social commentary, although we wouldn't perhaps put it like that, it's a bit too highfalutin for us, but we do blend social commentary and newsmaking with entertainment.
[02:08:40.471 --> 02:08:41.132]  Yes.
[02:08:41.132 --> 02:08:42.653]  How would you describe what you do?
[02:08:42.653 --> 02:08:45.915]  Well, I believe in my overall libertarian ideas.
[02:08:46.696 --> 02:08:59.467]  But then I'll play devil's advocate, I'll make jokes, and then the media, the corporate media, kind of snips it out and says, oh, when you're being silly, you're serious, saying the left are the only group that are allowed to be comical.
[02:08:59.467 --> 02:09:05.412]  Yeah, yeah, because I found that when I'm being silly, they'll pretend I was trying to be serious.
[02:09:05.412 --> 02:09:08.815]  And when I'm being serious, they'll say, you can't possibly have believed that.
[02:09:08.815 --> 02:09:10.797]  You get people asking you that, too.
[02:09:10.797 --> 02:09:11.698]  So if you want to know what
[02:09:11.718 --> 02:09:12.199]  I believe.
[02:09:12.199 --> 02:09:13.100]  Read the book.
[02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:14.761]  You know, if you want to know what Alex believes, watch it.
[02:09:14.761 --> 02:09:16.103]  Well, that's exactly what they do.
[02:09:16.103 --> 02:09:17.384]  They always edit things.
[02:09:17.384 --> 02:09:18.986]  They take them out of context.
[02:09:18.986 --> 02:09:20.928]  They never do real long-form interviews.
[02:09:20.928 --> 02:09:29.738]  Usually, whether it's for print or a TV show, if it's establishment, mainstream media, they'll interview you for five, six, seven, eight hours just to pretend they talked to you.
[02:09:30.239 --> 02:09:32.360]  Then they'll edit pieces that weren't even included.
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:34.261]  And they might not even use any of the footage.
[02:09:34.261 --> 02:09:37.402]  In some cases, if it's too reasonable or it's too interesting, they just won't use it at all.
[02:09:37.402 --> 02:09:45.385]  It's like Sean Hannity did an hour-long interview with retired Ted Koppel, they brought back out of retirement this year, and they edited it down to 70 seconds.
[02:09:46.585 --> 02:09:48.468]  And those 70 seconds were edited together.
[02:09:48.468 --> 02:09:52.473]  You can get people to say anything in an hour-long interview and edit it down together.
[02:09:52.473 --> 02:10:01.223]  I mean, we're going to be running this exactly as the conversation we have it, so people can actually see the conversation in context and can understand what we both... Isn't that racist, though?
[02:10:01.223 --> 02:10:01.824]  What?
[02:10:01.824 --> 02:10:03.386]  If you don't edit something in...
[02:10:05.789 --> 02:10:09.932]  Fair, unbiased, contextual journalism is probably racist.
[02:10:09.932 --> 02:10:11.294]  Also known as hate.
[02:10:11.294 --> 02:10:12.695]  Hate speech, hate speech.
[02:10:12.695 --> 02:10:14.076]  Homophobic.
[02:10:14.076 --> 02:10:25.647]  Allowing the subject to answer a question in full for themselves in their own words and not editing it down must be some kind of... Well the real form of no platforming is to just edit something to where it's non-recognizable and you've killed the person's platform.
[02:10:26.007 --> 02:10:28.390]  You're pretending like you have a platform, but there's not a platform.
[02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:36.899]  Kind of like YouTube now says, we put your video into the Phantom Zone where no one can see it, no one can like it, no one can share it, but it still exists just in cyberspace where no one can see it.
[02:10:38.044 --> 02:10:42.706]  Now, there seems to be a political dimension to this, because it doesn't happen uniformly across the spectrum.
[02:10:42.706 --> 02:10:45.968]  It seems to be conservatives and libertarians who get it particularly.
[02:10:45.968 --> 02:10:55.153]  Now, if you look to the left, you've got John Stewart, John Oliver, and you've got Bill Maher even, who's perhaps more substantial than the other two.
[02:10:55.153 --> 02:10:59.775]  And these people are entertainers as well as social commentators, as well as newsbreakers in some cases.
[02:10:59.775 --> 02:11:00.576]  But they're allowed
[02:11:01.496 --> 02:11:02.256]  They're allowed space.
[02:11:02.256 --> 02:11:05.537]  They can talk about Trump being a cockholster.
[02:11:05.537 --> 02:11:07.858]  They can use the N-word, which I wouldn't use, period.
[02:11:07.858 --> 02:11:10.058]  And that's okay, because they're the anointed priest class.
[02:11:10.058 --> 02:11:11.439]  Because they have the right politics.
[02:11:11.439 --> 02:11:12.879]  Yes.
[02:11:12.879 --> 02:11:16.040]  And that's basically, do you think that it is the politics that makes the difference?
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:16.920]  Absolutely.
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:21.321]  It's a total one-sided deal where they're the high priests of knowledge.
[02:11:21.321 --> 02:11:22.922]  They can do anything they want.
[02:11:22.922 --> 02:11:23.802]  Just everybody else
[02:11:24.744 --> 02:11:29.405]  Has to be blacklisted because quite frankly they don't want the competition.
[02:11:29.405 --> 02:11:40.428]  They can't compete with the big Americana, Western, Renaissance, Magna Carta, classical British, European freedom model.
[02:11:40.428 --> 02:11:41.128]  Western values.
[02:11:41.128 --> 02:11:41.788]  Western values.
[02:11:41.788 --> 02:11:45.669]  They can't compete so they have to pose like they're that but then restrict everybody else.
[02:11:46.329 --> 02:11:47.050]  Right.
[02:11:47.050 --> 02:11:48.091]  I think that's probably true.
[02:11:48.091 --> 02:11:53.477]  I experienced some of the consequences of that hypocrisy myself in February.
[02:11:53.477 --> 02:11:58.963]  When comments I made... I was making jokes about something that happened to me when I was younger.
[02:11:58.963 --> 02:12:00.445]  Speaking loosely and incautiously.
[02:12:01.186 --> 02:12:01.546]  Yeah, I think.
[02:12:20.243 --> 02:12:45.988]  Trying to explain to people the extraordinary lengths the media will go to to take down people it considers dangerous, people it considers alternate power centres, if you like, is very difficult because unless you're in the middle of it, like perhaps we are, in our own different ways, you know, on the receiving end of this mendacity, it can be difficult to try to explain to people just how dishonest they are.
[02:12:45.988 --> 02:12:47.668]  But let's do it one way, which is
[02:12:49.148 --> 02:12:53.669]  What kind of social consequences have you experienced for making the career choices you have?
[02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:57.350]  Because I sometimes feel like I've given up any hope of a social life.
[02:12:57.350 --> 02:13:00.611]  My friends are all on my payroll.
[02:13:00.611 --> 02:13:04.732]  How is your life as a result of the kind of career you have?
[02:13:04.732 --> 02:13:09.913]  Having what, for the politically correct establishment, would be very unpopular opinions.
[02:13:09.913 --> 02:13:17.655]  Well, the rewards have been a hundred times the negatives, but my ex-wife and her lawyers used
[02:13:19.582 --> 02:13:31.094]  Basically edited down versions of what I'd said and what I'd done in the press to then misrepresent who I was as a father and the press ganged up in the midst of that.
[02:13:31.094 --> 02:13:32.355]  Complicit with it, I'm sure.
[02:13:32.355 --> 02:13:36.740]  Oh yes, to create a misrepresentation of what I'd actually said and done.
[02:13:36.740 --> 02:13:42.566]  And one example, and the judge said she almost had a mistrial because of this, one example was
[02:13:44.133 --> 02:13:51.338]  They had an edited tape from Joe Rogan's podcast, the most downloaded podcast in history, when I was on the February... We've both done it, it's a great show.
[02:13:51.338 --> 02:13:51.438]  And...
[02:13:54.013 --> 02:13:59.074]  I said, I don't agree with Trump saying you can grab a woman by her genitals because she's throwing herself on him.
[02:13:59.074 --> 02:14:02.875]  But I said, it's not rape like he's in a, you know, the bushes jumping out.
[02:14:02.875 --> 02:14:05.135]  And Joe and Eddie Bravo agreed.
[02:14:05.135 --> 02:14:07.676]  They said Trump's wrong to say that.
[02:14:07.676 --> 02:14:08.536]  It's piggish, whatever.
[02:14:08.536 --> 02:14:09.436]  We wouldn't talk like that.
[02:14:09.436 --> 02:14:14.798]  You know, we've been doing it, but it's not rape because the women are throwing themselves on you.
[02:14:14.798 --> 02:14:15.958]  It's it's it's all just crude.
[02:14:16.858 --> 02:14:21.047]  We made the joke that if women said they're doing that to men, people say, oh, great girl, go after them.
[02:14:21.047 --> 02:14:23.632]  So we were basically looking at the different standards between feminine and male.
[02:14:23.632 --> 02:14:24.353]  Yeah.
[02:14:24.353 --> 02:14:25.495]  Well, they just edited.
[02:14:27.117 --> 02:14:29.599]  My dear ex-wife didn't do this, it was her lawyers.
[02:14:29.599 --> 02:14:34.863]  They just edited the front off the clip in the end where it sounded like I was legitimizing it.
[02:14:34.863 --> 02:14:35.824]  Right, making excuses for it.
[02:14:35.824 --> 02:14:40.828]  And they even said the clip was something else about marijuana legalization and then played that clip that wasn't in evidence.
[02:14:40.828 --> 02:14:52.137]  But then the media, even though they, I went and told the media, here's the full clip, I didn't do that, even though my lawyers corrected it, even though the judge said that wasn't in evidence and that's not the full clip because we were able to play it.
[02:14:53.035 --> 02:14:57.856]  The media ran with it and said, Jones says it's okay for Trump to rape women.
[02:14:57.856 --> 02:15:05.378]  Well, we didn't even ever say that it was rape, so that's the type of things they do where it becomes, because of your speech, you don't just get your book banned.
[02:15:05.378 --> 02:15:08.919]  You don't just get them saying things you didn't say and then trying to ruin you.
[02:15:08.919 --> 02:15:15.280]  They actually come and say, even though I didn't lose my children, the media now says I lost my children.
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:20.581]  So there's an even bigger lie on top of it that I've lost my children, which isn't the case.
[02:15:20.581 --> 02:15:20.982]  It's horrible.
[02:15:23.856 --> 02:15:36.144]  And it's a sort of shamelessness and cruelty with which they will be invasive and intrusive in a way I don't intend to be in this interview because I'm more interested in you than in your family life.
[02:15:36.144 --> 02:15:39.286]  But they'll come for anything and they'll do anything.
[02:15:39.286 --> 02:15:41.928]  It doesn't make any difference to them what the consequences might be to your life.
[02:15:41.928 --> 02:15:44.569]  I want to ask...
[02:15:47.069 --> 02:15:51.052]  You have this extraordinary, I've never seen anything like this before in my life.
[02:15:51.052 --> 02:15:53.294]  The only other person I can think of that's like this is Trump.
[02:15:53.294 --> 02:15:56.716]  You just have this limitless reserve of energy.
[02:15:56.716 --> 02:15:59.738]  It's like you take a little five minute break, and then you come back blazing.
[02:15:59.738 --> 02:16:05.363]  I mean, you know, I don't mean any offence by this, but I'm a younger guy than you, and I couldn't do half the stuff you do.
[02:16:05.363 --> 02:16:07.884]  I've seen you on livestreams at 3am and you're still going.
[02:16:07.884 --> 02:16:09.165]  Oh, you've got a lot of energy, my friend.
[02:16:09.165 --> 02:16:12.348]  Well, I've got some, but you, where does it come from?
[02:16:13.008 --> 02:16:14.029]  Where does this come from?
[02:16:14.029 --> 02:16:17.690]  Is it the injustice of the way that you're covered in the media?
[02:16:17.690 --> 02:16:22.213]  Is it the conviction with which you're covering the subjects that you're talking about?
[02:16:22.213 --> 02:16:31.037]  Where does this, because it seems like you just have this utterly limitless reserve, like you're powered by a, you know, an infinite gravity engine or something.
[02:16:31.037 --> 02:16:33.298]  You know, you just seem like a freight train.
[02:16:33.298 --> 02:16:41.822]  Well, we talked on the show earlier about Thomas Jefferson being classic liberal versus what we see as these control freak authoritarians, these fascists.
[02:16:42.182 --> 02:16:44.243]  They call themselves anti-fascist.
[02:16:44.243 --> 02:16:47.465]  He talks about the animating contest of liberty.
[02:16:47.465 --> 02:16:56.690]  And so, when you know what you've really said, and you see these big powerful institutions lying about you, there's something empowering.
[02:16:56.690 --> 02:17:00.852]  There were only a few times I got in a fight where I wasn't 100% in the right, and I got my ass kicked.
[02:17:00.852 --> 02:17:04.354]  But every time it was some guy a lot bigger than me that attacked me for no reason, I won the fight.
[02:17:05.194 --> 02:17:09.219]  And so there's something about that David versus Goliath energy thing.
[02:17:09.219 --> 02:17:11.422]  It was like defiance.
[02:17:11.422 --> 02:17:13.625]  You feel exactly defiance.
[02:17:13.625 --> 02:17:21.495]  And then there's also the exhilarating surge of the feeling of victory when you defeat the Goliaths.
[02:17:21.495 --> 02:17:23.717]  And then you have the experience of going through the
[02:17:25.290 --> 02:17:32.455]  Torsure, going through the test, going through the gauntlet, and then having the victory.
[02:17:32.455 --> 02:17:36.638]  I mean, I guess it's dopamine or whatever in the brain, but it's larger than that.
[02:17:36.638 --> 02:17:43.023]  I don't like con artists and thugs and people that try to keep the general public in the dark.
[02:17:43.023 --> 02:17:49.027]  I get a thrill out of seeing people being alive, being informed in competition.
[02:17:49.027 --> 02:17:52.990]  And because somebody's smarter than I am or more successful, I don't feel bad.
[02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:53.970]  I feel like extension.
[02:17:53.970 --> 02:17:54.791]  It doesn't scare you?
[02:17:55.011 --> 02:17:56.172]  That's another human.
[02:17:56.172 --> 02:17:58.114]  Their victories are my victories.
[02:17:58.114 --> 02:18:07.001]  And as long as it's humanity competing in an open system for the greater good, but also celebrating individualism, it adds to the overall true collective.
[02:18:07.001 --> 02:18:11.865]  So I'm fighting the false collective with a vision of the true human collective that is transcendent.
[02:18:12.766 --> 02:18:18.628]  So, I mean, that is classical liberalism as envisaged by JSNL in On Liberty.
[02:18:18.628 --> 02:18:20.888]  That's exactly how the marketplace of ideas should work.
[02:18:20.888 --> 02:18:27.530]  I mean, it seems to me, the reason I ask that question is when I watch you, and you, it is one of the few shows that I watch when I'm not on it.
[02:18:27.530 --> 02:18:30.971]  Which, for somebody in our business, being as busy as we are, we don't really watch much.
[02:18:30.971 --> 02:18:32.311]  You get burnt out on it.
[02:18:32.311 --> 02:18:35.852]  Right, we don't watch much of other people's... Well, thanks for putting up with me, because half of it's a train wreck.
[02:18:36.952 --> 02:18:38.033]  No, I mean, it's not a train wreck.
[02:18:38.033 --> 02:18:40.214]  There's some stuff that I'm like, hmm.
[02:18:40.214 --> 02:18:44.557]  But, you know, I find it, you know, it's always entertaining.
[02:18:44.557 --> 02:18:50.821]  But the thing that I will say in your favor is you never, to me, come across as insincere.
[02:18:50.821 --> 02:18:52.362]  I believe that you mean what you say.
[02:18:52.362 --> 02:18:54.504]  And I believe that you mean what you're doing.
[02:18:54.504 --> 02:18:56.745]  And that's why I asked about where the energy reserves come from.
[02:18:56.745 --> 02:18:59.107]  Because my hunch was that it's something a bit like me.
[02:18:59.107 --> 02:19:03.590]  You actually really believe this stuff and you need to, you need to... Exactly.
[02:19:03.590 --> 02:19:05.751]  I've got a stack of news we didn't get to today.
[02:19:06.972 --> 02:19:10.776]  So he spent an hour roasting Newsweek for their presidency.
[02:19:21.848 --> 02:19:23.089]  These things get me upset.
[02:19:23.089 --> 02:19:27.792]  It's like the whole world is wrong and I've got to get through these different things.
[02:19:27.792 --> 02:19:31.814]  I feel disempowered unless I can cover something and talk about it.
[02:19:31.814 --> 02:19:34.736]  And then somehow I'm almost like OCD about information.
[02:19:34.736 --> 02:19:37.738]  If I can talk about it and give my angle, then I don't have an anxiety.
[02:19:51.107 --> 02:19:52.788]  Do you trust our economy?
[02:19:52.788 --> 02:19:54.489]  How about our banking system?
[02:19:54.489 --> 02:20:01.672]  Our president has stated we are sitting on a bubble right now, and that when the Fed raises interest rates, bad things are going to happen.
[02:20:01.672 --> 02:20:04.053]  Well, the Fed is raising rates here and now.

[02:24:13.982 --> 02:24:20.903]  I feel disempowered unless I can cover something and talk about it, and then somehow I'm almost like OCD about information.
[02:24:20.903 --> 02:24:24.304]  If I can talk about it and give my angle, then I don't have an anxiety.
[02:24:24.304 --> 02:24:25.104]  Yeah.
[02:24:25.104 --> 02:24:26.585]  So I really, a lot of it is.
[02:24:26.585 --> 02:24:31.866]  I think a lot of your viewers are like that, and I think a lot of my readers are like that, and I think it's a, maybe it's a boy thing.
[02:24:31.866 --> 02:24:37.107]  Um, it's something I've noticed about a lot of people who spend a lot of time on the internet, a lot of people who consume a lot of news.
[02:24:37.107 --> 02:24:37.867]  They have that, that.
[02:24:37.867 --> 02:24:38.767]  The autistic army.
[02:24:39.207 --> 02:24:40.368]  Which doesn't mean mean.
[02:24:40.368 --> 02:24:43.612]  It's like you can't stop the... There's something a bit Aspie about us, isn't there?
[02:24:43.612 --> 02:24:44.212]  Asperger-ish.
[02:24:44.212 --> 02:24:47.395]  You've gotta like... Someone somewhere on the internet is wrong.
[02:24:47.395 --> 02:24:48.757]  And I have to let them know about it.
[02:24:48.757 --> 02:24:50.078]  I have to fix it.
[02:24:50.078 --> 02:24:51.019]  I think it's fair.
[02:24:51.019 --> 02:24:52.721]  So you mentioned about when you're tired.
[02:24:52.721 --> 02:24:54.803]  Talk to me about when you're off camera.
[02:24:54.803 --> 02:24:55.824]  Do you have hobbies?
[02:24:56.144 --> 02:24:58.765]  Is there something that you do that's not related to work?
[02:24:58.765 --> 02:24:59.645]  I like to go hiking.
[02:24:59.645 --> 02:25:01.526]  I like to go boating.
[02:25:01.526 --> 02:25:03.846]  I like to go see movies.
[02:25:03.846 --> 02:25:05.127]  I like to go out to eat, obviously.
[02:25:05.127 --> 02:25:07.387]  I don't miss a lot of meals.
[02:25:07.387 --> 02:25:09.788]  I like to hang out with my friends.
[02:25:09.788 --> 02:25:11.489]  I kind of don't drink and then do drink.
[02:25:11.489 --> 02:25:14.150]  I like to go drink alcohol.
[02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:18.331]  I like to basically read different art literature.
[02:25:18.331 --> 02:25:19.611]  I like to look at art.
[02:25:19.611 --> 02:25:21.592]  I like to look at architecture.
[02:25:21.592 --> 02:25:22.612]  You know, I like the catalogs.
[02:25:22.612 --> 02:25:24.933]  Even though I'm not buying a lot of furniture, I like to look at furniture catalogs.
[02:25:25.513 --> 02:25:26.133]  We get the idea.
[02:25:26.133 --> 02:25:29.856]  So you're just like in your home life as you are on set.
[02:25:29.856 --> 02:25:33.558]  It's endless and limitless and freewheeling and full.
[02:25:33.558 --> 02:25:34.238]  Yeah, I like botany.
[02:25:34.238 --> 02:25:35.659]  I got a bunch of plants.
[02:25:35.659 --> 02:25:36.299]  Plums?
[02:25:36.299 --> 02:25:37.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:40.341]  Amazing.
[02:25:40.341 --> 02:25:45.464]  It's always heartening to me when I find somebody who's the same off-screen as they are on.
[02:25:45.464 --> 02:25:48.566]  Because there's a sort of authenticity and earnestness about you that I really like.
[02:25:48.566 --> 02:25:50.387]  Because I know you mean it.
[02:25:50.387 --> 02:25:51.908]  We couldn't misrepresent this train wreck.
[02:25:53.445 --> 02:25:59.431]  Well, I kind of know what you mean, because I sort of feel the same about my college talk, so I'm kind of like, I catch myself, you know, what are you doing?
[02:25:59.431 --> 02:26:01.873]  But I mean it, and people know I mean it, you know?
[02:26:01.873 --> 02:26:03.455]  Even when we're joking, he's having like, they'll take...
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:09.202]  Our interview we did live on air where I'm joking about I want to marry Glenn Beck and you know all this.
[02:26:09.202 --> 02:26:10.923]  It's all just a silly joke.
[02:26:10.923 --> 02:26:14.265]  They're going to say Jones who makes it up that he's married to Beck.
[02:26:14.265 --> 02:26:18.306]  No, when I'm being serious about a piece of news about some peace deal, I'm being serious.
[02:26:18.306 --> 02:26:20.868]  But when I'm saying I want to marry Glenn Beck, it's a joke.
[02:26:20.868 --> 02:26:23.889]  Yeah, and guess what guys, that might be a joke.
[02:26:23.889 --> 02:26:33.994]  Let me ask, I don't want to intrude too much into your home life because I'm more interested in you as a human being, but just in terms of logistics, because your life must be difficult.
[02:26:34.898 --> 02:26:42.902]  Given the decisions that you've made, the opinions that you have, the empire you've built around yourself, and it continues to grow.
[02:26:42.902 --> 02:26:44.943]  As far as I can see, it's growing at a rate of knots.
[02:26:44.943 --> 02:26:47.864]  This place is huge and buzzing.
[02:26:47.864 --> 02:26:48.685]  This is just one building.
[02:26:48.685 --> 02:26:49.765]  We've got some other ones.
[02:26:49.765 --> 02:26:50.986]  But yeah, we're building a new studio.
[02:26:50.986 --> 02:26:51.926]  Come down and be in the new one.
[02:26:51.926 --> 02:26:54.368]  It's huge, and I just wonder, like...
[02:26:55.288 --> 02:26:56.208]  Just like the day-to-day stuff.
[02:26:56.208 --> 02:26:58.449]  What happens if you're at home and you want tacos?
[02:26:58.449 --> 02:26:59.210]  You know, like, who does that?
[02:26:59.210 --> 02:27:02.611]  Because you don't strike me as the kind of guy who's got, like, a retinue of personal assistants.
[02:27:02.611 --> 02:27:07.553]  But you can't exactly walk down the street and just go to the takeout place, right?
[02:27:07.553 --> 02:27:12.356]  So do you have, like... How does it work, just being Alex Jones, when you're not...
[02:27:13.536 --> 02:27:21.725]  On-screen I'd say I've got usually a nanny or an assistant till about five o'clock, but I mean I would just go There's a taco place right by the house and we get that a lot.
[02:27:21.725 --> 02:27:29.413]  You do get tacos Yeah, and and then back during the campaign like half the workers were wearing Bernie Sanders shirts, but I noticed a lot of them actually liked
[02:27:30.094 --> 02:27:30.795]  Like Trump, too.
[02:27:30.795 --> 02:27:33.756]  They were just anti-Jeb Bush, anti-Hillary.
[02:27:33.756 --> 02:27:36.218]  And so a few of them, you know, would argue with me.
[02:27:36.218 --> 02:27:38.920]  But they weren't really mad until Trump won.
[02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:42.282]  And a few of them kind of got in my face when I was getting tacos.
[02:27:42.282 --> 02:27:49.166]  And yeah, I mean, for every hundred people that shake my hand, and it's like every third or fourth person wants to shake my hand, there will be somebody who just goes, F you, Russian spy!
[02:27:49.166 --> 02:27:51.148]  Or F you, KKK!
[02:27:51.148 --> 02:27:54.150]  Or just like, it's like that person's mentally ill.
[02:27:54.150 --> 02:27:55.991]  It's kind of like they're a victim of propaganda.
[02:27:55.991 --> 02:27:57.632]  It's kind of like I'm driving up to a red line.
[02:27:58.092 --> 02:27:59.833]  There's a poor schizophrenic person.
[02:27:59.833 --> 02:28:01.354]  You know, most of the homeless people have mental problems.
[02:28:01.354 --> 02:28:02.254]  I'm sad for them.
[02:28:02.254 --> 02:28:03.615]  And they're like talking to the wind.
[02:28:03.615 --> 02:28:05.055]  And they spot you or something.
[02:28:05.055 --> 02:28:07.517]  And they turn and they go, you're my father!
[02:28:07.517 --> 02:28:08.077]  I hate you!
[02:28:08.077 --> 02:28:10.318]  And it's some drooling 80-year-old guy.
[02:28:10.318 --> 02:28:11.959]  You're not mad at him.
[02:28:11.959 --> 02:28:12.939]  You feel sorry for him.
[02:28:12.939 --> 02:28:13.720]  You lock your doors.
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:14.960]  You drive on past.
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:16.081]  But it doesn't like morally.
[02:28:16.974 --> 02:28:22.016]  The leftists, this happens like, maybe every five or six times we like to eat now, they'll walk over and go, boo!
[02:28:22.016 --> 02:28:22.716]  Everyone hates you!
[02:28:22.716 --> 02:28:23.696]  F you, Alex!
[02:28:23.696 --> 02:28:24.837]  And I'll go, thank you.
[02:28:24.837 --> 02:28:26.638]  They'll go, oh yeah, knock your drink over.
[02:28:26.638 --> 02:28:28.938]  Everyone doesn't hate you.
[02:28:28.938 --> 02:28:31.239]  Exactly, they want to make you think.
[02:28:31.239 --> 02:28:33.040]  It's all with them, because everything with them is peer pressure.
[02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:33.500]  Yeah.
[02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:40.722]  Everything is their little botch and their fake liberalism and so they want to tell you you're not cool because most of them weren't cool in school.
[02:28:40.722 --> 02:28:42.242]  I've learned most modern liberals were nerds.
[02:28:42.242 --> 02:28:43.922]  How they've ended up being social justice warriors.
[02:28:43.922 --> 02:28:50.164]  It's, you know, well we all know how Rush Limbaugh says about why people end up being feminists.
[02:28:50.164 --> 02:28:55.925]  It doesn't take a genius to work out why the boys end up being social justice warriors, why a lot of these people end up with the politics they do.
[02:28:56.445 --> 02:28:57.688]  And end up behaving as they do.
[02:28:57.688 --> 02:29:03.021]  They're empowered by media, by Hollywood, by academia to be the bullies.
[02:29:03.021 --> 02:29:04.385]  To be the bullies they never were in school.
[02:29:07.372 --> 02:29:11.915]  That's the thing, though, is that they think I care about fake peer pressure that doesn't exist.
[02:29:11.915 --> 02:29:15.818]  They're trying to echo some cyber... Version of popularity that doesn't matter to you.
[02:29:15.818 --> 02:29:16.218]  Exactly.
[02:29:16.218 --> 02:29:27.806]  Well, they're trying to echo some cyberspace synthetic popularity that they believe they're part of in the third dimension at me, and I know that the last hundred people just shook my hand, literally.
[02:29:27.806 --> 02:29:31.448]  It's like a hundred to one for the one person that screams, Russian scum, Russian scum.
[02:29:31.448 --> 02:29:32.269]  I get the same thing.
[02:29:32.269 --> 02:29:32.909]  I get the same thing.
[02:29:32.909 --> 02:29:34.670]  And then I go over to them and I go, come here, come here.
[02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:35.451]  No, no, F you.
[02:29:35.831 --> 02:29:37.632]  And they're all, and I'm like, come on over here.
[02:29:37.632 --> 02:29:40.054]  You know, it's so weird because I do the same thing.
[02:29:40.054 --> 02:29:41.455]  We're on the march.
[02:29:41.455 --> 02:29:43.997]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:43.997 --> 02:29:46.679]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:52.213 --> 02:29:53.634]  Why is the fungus?
[02:29:53.634 --> 02:29:54.715]  Why is the mold?
[02:29:54.715 --> 02:29:56.456]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[02:29:56.456 --> 02:29:57.437]  What is going on?
[02:29:57.437 --> 02:29:58.197]  What has changed?
[02:30:22.473 --> 02:30:23.913]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[02:30:23.913 --> 02:30:25.894]  I want to get your reviews on here, what you have to say.
[02:30:25.894 --> 02:30:27.334]  For me, it's been incredible.
[02:30:27.334 --> 02:30:31.875]  MycoZX, anti-fungal, anti-fungus, anti-yeast.
[02:30:31.875 --> 02:30:32.595]  Get it today.
[02:30:32.595 --> 02:30:33.215]  Limited run.
[02:30:33.215 --> 02:30:34.576]  It'll be months till we get more.
[02:30:34.576 --> 02:30:39.257]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:30:39.257 --> 02:30:42.597]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[02:30:42.597 --> 02:30:44.918]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[02:30:44.918 --> 02:30:46.338]  Look at the response we're getting.
[02:30:46.338 --> 02:30:48.259]  We're changing the world together.
[02:30:48.259 --> 02:30:49.279]  You are the InfoWar.
[02:30:49.279 --> 02:30:50.039]  God bless you all.
[02:30:51.767 --> 02:31:00.854]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:31:00.854 --> 02:31:09.261]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:09.261 --> 02:31:13.925]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:31:14.125 --> 02:31:20.910]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:28.114]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:28.114 --> 02:31:35.119]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:35.119 --> 02:31:39.462]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:31:39.582 --> 02:31:51.447]  As most of you already know I am a voracious consumer of news and information and in the last four or five years doing more and more research I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition
[02:32:08.015 --> 02:32:08.736]  We're good to go.
[02:32:29.915 --> 02:32:32.277]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[02:32:32.277 --> 02:32:33.738]  We're getting results.
[02:32:33.738 --> 02:32:39.861]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[02:32:39.861 --> 02:32:42.743]  Caveman is finally back at the InfoWars store.
[02:32:42.743 --> 02:32:49.267]  You can get 25% off the regular price for a limited time only at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, AAA253-3139.
[02:33:05.393 --> 02:33:09.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:12.540 --> 02:33:17.061]  That's the thing, though, is that they think I care about fake peer pressure that doesn't exist.
[02:33:17.061 --> 02:33:20.962]  They're trying to echo some cyber... Version of popularity that doesn't matter to you.
[02:33:20.962 --> 02:33:21.362]  Exactly.
[02:33:21.362 --> 02:33:32.965]  Well, they're trying to echo some cyberspace, synthetic popularity that they believe they're part of in the third dimension at me, and I know that the last hundred people just shook my hand, literally.
[02:33:32.965 --> 02:33:37.406]  It's like 101 for the one person that screams, Russian scum, Russian... I get the same thing.
[02:33:37.406 --> 02:33:38.066]  I get the same thing.
[02:33:38.066 --> 02:33:39.707]  And then I go over to them and I go, come here, come here.
[02:33:39.707 --> 02:33:40.807]  They go, no, no, ask you, ask...
[02:33:40.987 --> 02:33:43.209]  And they're all, and I'm like, come on over here.
[02:33:43.209 --> 02:33:44.951]  It's so weird because I do the same thing.
[02:33:44.951 --> 02:33:46.412]  And I'll be like, wait, let's have a conversation.
[02:33:46.412 --> 02:33:47.333]  And they're like, no.
[02:33:47.333 --> 02:33:50.356]  And I'm like, please, on camera, tell me how I'm a Russian spy or how I'm KKK.
[02:33:50.356 --> 02:33:52.658]  Explain, explain.
[02:33:52.658 --> 02:33:58.623]  And I've had people come up to me, and I've been with boyfriends, and you know my taste in men.
[02:33:58.623 --> 02:34:00.165]  And they're calling me a white supremacist.
[02:34:00.165 --> 02:34:03.047]  And I'm like, I can't even.
[02:34:03.047 --> 02:34:04.609]  That's the new thing where they just scream,
[02:34:07.609 --> 02:34:13.052]  Racist at everybody, and it's like some magic word they're using.
[02:34:13.052 --> 02:34:30.563]  And the problem is though, all of their racist rhetoric is, I grew up in middle class neighborhoods, never really heard any racist stuff, it is producing in some white people kind of a classic racism, which isn't good, because it's meant to divide us all, like we're in a prison, and the government's the warden, and the left is hyping race so bad,
[02:34:31.323 --> 02:34:35.384]  That if you're not mentally sophisticated, you start getting into it.
[02:34:35.384 --> 02:34:36.985]  I think the whole culture is hyping race.
[02:34:36.985 --> 02:34:38.205]  It's not just the government, is it?
[02:34:38.205 --> 02:34:40.826]  It's Hollywood too, and academia.
[02:34:40.826 --> 02:34:46.287]  It seems like the whole of establishment culture is dividing people with identity politics.
[02:34:46.287 --> 02:34:50.549]  And inevitably, people only know what they learn.
[02:34:50.549 --> 02:34:52.449]  They behave how they're trained to behave.
[02:34:52.449 --> 02:34:52.989]  And if you tell
[02:34:55.230 --> 02:35:14.899]  Well, young kids, college students, you know, oh, well, there's a black student union, there's a feminist society on campus, there's this, there's that, there's that, and at the same time, you tell them, oh, but straight white men are the devil and poison and the oppressors of history, they're going to think, well, first of all, that doesn't jive with my experience, and is that really true about myself, and where's my special group?
[02:35:14.899 --> 02:35:15.339]  You know?
[02:35:15.339 --> 02:35:16.100]  Whereas, I think...
[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:23.823]  What I get from you, one of the things that perhaps we have in common, is that you're a classical liberal who believes a lot more in ideas than identity.
[02:35:23.823 --> 02:35:26.884]  And you want people to unite around... Exactly.
[02:35:26.884 --> 02:35:31.786]  If somebody's got great food, I don't care if they're gay, straight, black or white or Asian, I'm gonna eat there.
[02:35:31.786 --> 02:35:33.667]  If their music's good, I'm gonna go to their concert.
[02:35:34.267 --> 02:35:46.152]  I'm into individuals and their brains and the great experience of true diversity versus identity politics that creates these, these, these reservoirs that they control, that I'm supposed to only paint with these colors.
[02:35:46.152 --> 02:35:48.973]  I'm supposed to only see through these maps.
[02:35:48.973 --> 02:35:50.294]  Well, that's mental slavery.
[02:35:50.294 --> 02:35:51.334]  That's orthodoxy.
[02:35:51.334 --> 02:35:56.096]  I don't want to see the world through a priesthood, through a priesthood that tells me how to think.
[02:35:56.096 --> 02:35:57.797]  I want to interface with the universe myself.
[02:35:58.217 --> 02:35:58.757]  Yeah.
[02:35:58.757 --> 02:36:07.162]  Like the cultural appropriation thing where they say, you know, you can't wear a kimono if you didn't grow up, you know, being in some way that is never quite specified.
[02:36:07.162 --> 02:36:10.904]  Or they say it's insulting to dress up in a Japanese kimono for a party.
[02:36:10.904 --> 02:36:11.945]  No, it's fun.
[02:36:11.945 --> 02:36:14.286]  Then you eat Japanese food.
[02:36:14.286 --> 02:36:17.427]  Or you want Mexican food and it's fun to wear sombreros and drink tequila.
[02:36:17.427 --> 02:36:20.289]  You're not stereotyping Mexicans as drunk tequila drinkers.
[02:36:20.289 --> 02:36:21.770]  The point is you want to get drunk on tequila.
[02:36:22.711 --> 02:36:28.138]  Let me ask you about Trump.
[02:36:28.138 --> 02:36:30.260]  Trump is the reality TV president.
[02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:34.325]  He has brought entertainment industry dynamics into the Oval Office.
[02:36:34.325 --> 02:36:35.407]  Some people love it.
[02:36:35.407 --> 02:36:36.108]  Some people hate it.
[02:36:37.205 --> 02:36:37.906]  I kind of like it.
[02:36:37.906 --> 02:36:46.895]  I don't really hear anybody talk about the Kardashians anymore, but I do hear people say, what did Stephen Miller say to Jim Acosta at the briefing today?
[02:36:46.895 --> 02:36:51.979]  He's kind of turned the White House into an entertainment spectacle in a way that politics wasn't before.
[02:36:52.780 --> 02:36:56.122]  Is there a dimension of that in what you do at Infowars?
[02:36:56.122 --> 02:37:01.666]  You know, bringing in the entertainment, because you're obviously your own camera persona.
[02:37:01.666 --> 02:37:02.747]  Very high energy.
[02:37:02.747 --> 02:37:09.852]  You have some sort of rhetorical and metaphoric things that you lean on sometimes that we talked about in your show earlier.
[02:37:09.852 --> 02:37:17.637]  Some of the language you use is strong, but completely reasonable when taken metaphorically, you know?
[02:37:17.637 --> 02:37:21.099]  Is there an element of bringing in that sort of reality spectacle entertainment?
[02:37:22.921 --> 02:37:30.475]  I suppose what I'm getting at is how consciously aware are you of the entertainment element of what you do versus here's what you've got to hear America.
[02:37:32.526 --> 02:37:34.068]  I should try to be more entertaining.
[02:37:34.068 --> 02:37:39.354]  I get so serious most of the time that... You perceive yourself as being too serious.
[02:37:39.354 --> 02:37:44.360]  Yeah, and then quite frankly, when I am being goofy and stuff, it's because it's Gallo's humor.
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:45.361]  I'm naturally that way.
[02:37:45.361 --> 02:37:46.202]  I want to do that.
[02:37:46.202 --> 02:37:47.764]  Yeah.
[02:37:47.764 --> 02:37:50.827]  And so if there's anything fake, it's not so much fake.
[02:37:50.827 --> 02:37:52.950]  I'm not as serious a person in my daily life.
[02:37:54.272 --> 02:37:55.694]  In person as I am on air.
[02:37:55.694 --> 02:37:57.837]  But this is a serious topic.
[02:37:57.837 --> 02:37:58.779]  A whole serious thing.
[02:37:58.779 --> 02:38:00.301]  So I tend to get too serious.
[02:38:00.301 --> 02:38:03.586]  Whereas you can be serious and joke around.
[02:38:03.586 --> 02:38:05.228]  Then with that chemistry we kind of had fun.
[02:38:05.228 --> 02:38:06.089]  It was real.
[02:38:06.089 --> 02:38:08.193]  We kind of amped each other up a little bit.
[02:38:08.193 --> 02:38:08.613]  Exactly.
[02:38:08.613 --> 02:38:09.855]  We were enjoying each other's company.
[02:38:09.935 --> 02:38:10.895]  Sure, but I mean, exactly.
[02:38:10.895 --> 02:38:11.955]  None of it's fake.
[02:38:11.955 --> 02:38:13.316]  It's all a real expression.
[02:38:13.316 --> 02:38:15.556]  But yes, I... I'm not suggesting it's fake.
[02:38:15.556 --> 02:38:25.439]  I'm just... I think people wonder, sort of, how conscious you are of... Let's say, for instance, you know, because you have a big meme ecosystem around you, and you obviously enjoy that.
[02:38:25.439 --> 02:38:27.699]  You're aware of it, and you like it, right?
[02:38:27.699 --> 02:38:31.400]  The kind of... Yeah, because I hate taking myself serious.
[02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:33.801]  Right, that's what I think.
[02:38:33.801 --> 02:38:35.203]  It's fun to be made fun of.
[02:38:35.203 --> 02:38:39.646]  That's what I think I'm getting at, because people sometimes ask me, you know, is this fake?
[02:38:39.646 --> 02:38:40.967]  Is this a put-on persona?
[02:38:40.967 --> 02:38:43.469]  No, I just don't take myself as seriously as you.
[02:38:43.469 --> 02:38:45.350]  That's always my answer to that question.
[02:38:45.350 --> 02:38:46.331]  Same for you.
[02:38:46.331 --> 02:38:46.912]  Exactly.
[02:38:46.912 --> 02:39:00.382]  And look, studying history, before politics was entertainment, the local stump where people stood up and spoke, the main gladiatorial event was being politically involved so that you could be freer.
[02:39:03.999 --> 02:39:23.312]  Different propagandists came out with programs where they kind of merged politics with Hollywood, Edward Bernays and others, to then basically transfer the entertainment from politics onto sports, onto movies, onto TV, onto radio.
[02:39:23.312 --> 02:39:26.554]  And your career as politicians have become boring and too polished.
[02:39:26.554 --> 02:39:26.934]  Exactly.
[02:39:26.934 --> 02:39:30.957]  They've become boring and polished on purpose to make it an elite sport
[02:39:31.457 --> 02:39:35.542]  So that the general public, the unwashed, isn't involved in interfacing.
[02:39:35.542 --> 02:39:43.051]  Because the elites complained in the 1890s in major news articles, the Americans are the highest literacy level, even though they're some coal miner.
[02:39:43.051 --> 02:39:44.232]  They're really into politics.
[02:39:44.232 --> 02:39:45.553]  It's a sport here.
[02:39:45.553 --> 02:39:49.338]  The elites can't take over because of this American system.
[02:39:49.338 --> 02:39:50.719]  We've got to make it boring.
[02:39:51.542 --> 02:39:53.683]  And so that's basically what they did.
[02:39:53.683 --> 02:39:57.604]  And so Trump is making it cool to be grassroots again.
[02:39:57.604 --> 02:40:00.045]  He's making it cool to be counterculture.
[02:40:00.045 --> 02:40:03.407]  He's making it cool to get back to what Americana was.
[02:40:03.407 --> 02:40:05.007]  Trump's very Americana.
[02:40:05.007 --> 02:40:11.430]  And I think, I think there's a reason people like him, and you, and me, and the three of us are very different.
[02:40:11.430 --> 02:40:15.972]  But there's a reason that we're all liked, I think, and it's that we're not perfect.
[02:40:15.972 --> 02:40:18.353]  We're kind of scruffy, rough around the edges in some ways, you know?
[02:40:18.353 --> 02:40:18.733]  But real?
[02:40:19.153 --> 02:40:20.294]  Real, yeah.
[02:40:20.294 --> 02:40:20.554]  Real.
[02:40:20.554 --> 02:40:21.494]  We mean what we say.
[02:40:21.494 --> 02:40:23.755]  People instinctively can look.
[02:40:23.755 --> 02:40:26.076]  People know a commercial, even if it's got top actors.
[02:40:26.076 --> 02:40:26.956]  They know it's fake.
[02:40:26.956 --> 02:40:28.597]  You look at something, you know it's real.
[02:40:28.597 --> 02:40:30.178]  I mean, they know we're real.
[02:40:30.178 --> 02:40:32.358]  That's why they constantly say we're not real.
[02:40:32.358 --> 02:40:35.980]  That's why MSM keeps saying he's an actor, or you're an actor, or you're a fake, or you're a fraud.
[02:40:36.340 --> 02:40:38.101]  Well, what does it matter who we really are?
[02:40:38.101 --> 02:40:39.582]  What we say is what matters.
[02:40:39.582 --> 02:40:48.967]  When Trump breaks the back of political correctness, when Trump defends the borders, when Trump crushes ISIS, when Trump gets $4 trillion in the stock market, like Christ said, judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:40:48.967 --> 02:40:50.608]  Do you believe in Christ or not?
[02:40:50.608 --> 02:40:52.489]  Don't you judge a tree by its fruits?
[02:40:52.489 --> 02:40:55.831]  Like if a tree, you eat something off a tree, it kills you, you don't eat off a tree.
[02:40:55.831 --> 02:41:00.633]  If something produces good stuff for everybody, is it good or is it bad?
[02:41:00.633 --> 02:41:02.775]  And I think right there is what we're talking about with Trump.
[02:41:02.775 --> 02:41:04.796]  And he is the underdog.
[02:41:06.284 --> 02:41:15.447]  And they're trying to make him incompetent, they're trying to demonize him, they're trying to destroy him, because they are the scum that, while we were asleep, came in and took over the political process.
[02:41:15.447 --> 02:41:18.708]  The genie that won't go back in the bottle that Trump has unleashed, is that president?
[02:41:18.708 --> 02:41:19.208]  That's right.
[02:41:19.208 --> 02:41:23.410]  It's just like they have these fake polls where he's 15 points behind on election day, but he wins.
[02:41:23.410 --> 02:41:25.090]  And they've got fake polls now saying he's behind.
[02:41:25.090 --> 02:41:26.131]  They're fake.
[02:41:26.131 --> 02:41:28.852]  They admit most people even in those polls saying, no, I don't like Trump.
[02:41:28.852 --> 02:41:30.712]  It's because they're embarrassed on the telephone.
[02:41:30.712 --> 02:41:32.713]  They don't want to say they support him, so that's what you're saying.
[02:41:32.713 --> 02:41:33.853]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:33.853 --> 02:41:35.434]  But the dam is breaking now.
[02:41:35.974 --> 02:41:40.396]  And the dam is breaking because people are realizing that we tell the truth more often than they do.
[02:41:40.396 --> 02:41:43.977]  And like you said during the break, saying we're Nazis doesn't work, saying we're racist.
[02:41:43.977 --> 02:41:50.399]  So now John Oliver last week had like a child product that's like private label from a Whole Foods company.
[02:41:50.399 --> 02:41:53.280]  Now I guess Bezos owns it, you might take it away from me.
[02:41:53.280 --> 02:41:59.722]  But we private label, you know, just a 30-year-old product that's got herbs and stuff that calm children down.
[02:42:00.262 --> 02:42:04.166]  And he said, oh, you want to knock children out so you can basically, I mean, that's all they've got.
[02:42:04.166 --> 02:42:05.227]  But that's the implication.
[02:42:05.227 --> 02:42:05.687]  Yes.
[02:42:05.687 --> 02:42:06.988]  But then that's all they've got left.
[02:42:06.988 --> 02:42:07.989]  White supremacists didn't work.
[02:42:11.246 --> 02:42:14.789]  Let's talk, you mentioned about sort of judging by the fruit.
[02:42:14.789 --> 02:42:27.278]  I mentioned on your show today that history has this sort of habit, if you wait long enough, Alex Jones seems to get proven right about a remarkable number of things.
[02:42:27.278 --> 02:42:39.047]  And the classic clip that they always play trying to, unsuccessfully I think, paint him as a figure of fun, in a way that they tried to do with Trump, again failing, is the frogs.
[02:42:40.427 --> 02:42:42.208]  Let's talk about the frog.
[02:42:42.208 --> 02:42:45.469]  The WB frog is gay.
[02:42:45.469 --> 02:42:49.030]  The WB frog does look gay.
[02:42:49.030 --> 02:43:00.374]  But you're in one of your riffs and it's very, I've watched the clip because I went back and watched it, it's very clear from context that you're in a riff and you know, I just don't want stuff in the water that turns the frog there.
[02:43:00.374 --> 02:43:02.095]  You're talking about chemicals and all the rest of it.
[02:43:02.435 --> 02:43:04.457]  Now it makes perfect sense in context.
[02:43:04.457 --> 02:43:08.220]  Obviously it's funny because you have a very animated manner when you wrench it out of context.
[02:43:08.220 --> 02:43:10.442]  But what do I read in the Daily Mail this week?
[02:43:10.442 --> 02:43:14.125]  Well, it turns out contraceptive pills and cleaning, have you seen this?
[02:43:14.125 --> 02:43:20.831]  Contraceptive pills and cleaning products that are flushed down the toilet are turning one in five male river fish transgender.
[02:43:20.831 --> 02:43:24.474]  You wait long enough, Alex Jones gets proven right again!
[02:43:24.474 --> 02:43:29.178]  Now I'm not saying right about everything and I don't think you'd be offended by me saying that we disagree on some things.
[02:43:29.538 --> 02:43:32.181]  And some things have not turned out to be right.
[02:43:32.181 --> 02:43:43.791]  But let me ask about that, because I think you and I have... You and I both have an experience, I think, of tumbling out of Internet culture and into the real world, in a way, in the last couple of years.
[02:43:43.791 --> 02:43:52.679]  Exactly, like you're saying things not knowing you're totally being paid attention to, and then in the aftermath later, they... I'm not being paid attention to in a particular kind of way, you know?
[02:43:52.679 --> 02:43:55.542]  It's like, if you're going on a sort of performance riff,
[02:43:55.782 --> 02:43:58.965]  Yeah, the general topic's true, but then there's some satire.
[02:43:58.965 --> 02:44:02.008]  You've got to watch out, because now the MSM's watching.
[02:44:02.008 --> 02:44:03.449]  They're going to present it as if you meant it.
[02:44:03.449 --> 02:44:04.090]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:44:04.090 --> 02:44:15.140]  So they're, they're, Alec, they, they pick the most ridiculous bit of the riff, of the, of the bit, you know, that you're doing, and they pull it out, and they say, you think that the frogs are turning gay, or something.
[02:44:15.140 --> 02:44:17.422]  Because it, it sounds as ridiculous as possible.
[02:44:17.422 --> 02:44:19.364]  Let me ask you a serious question, though.
[02:44:19.364 --> 02:44:20.024]  Is there anything
[02:44:21.165 --> 02:44:38.523]  From an earlier period in your career that now you have the stature and prominence and success that you do and your organization is growing your platform is growing you have Influence on the president clearly and influence on it with his voters you
[02:44:39.384 --> 02:44:42.225]  Undoubtedly helped to put him in office.
[02:44:42.225 --> 02:44:48.468]  Is there anything earlier in your career that you kind of, somewhere you wish you hadn't gone or something you wish you hadn't said?
[02:44:48.468 --> 02:44:55.311]  Is there anything that you might have done differently if you had realized that people were going to start behaving like this?
[02:44:55.311 --> 02:44:56.052]  Or they may not be.
[02:44:56.052 --> 02:44:58.953]  You may say, you know what, screw them.
[02:44:58.953 --> 02:45:00.454]  I don't care, you know?
[02:45:00.454 --> 02:45:00.914]  Is there anything...
[02:45:01.554 --> 02:45:15.181]  Yeah, knowing how the media misrepresents what I've done things different, which I do now, because sometimes they'll attack me and say something that's not true, and then I'll quote what they said that wasn't true, and they'll use that quote as if I said it.
[02:45:15.181 --> 02:45:16.442]  So I'm more careful now.
[02:45:16.442 --> 02:45:22.505]  Sort of this Kafkaesque cycle where they use your debunking of them to claim a fresh round.
[02:45:22.505 --> 02:45:26.987]  Yes, they use where you say, I did not say this.
[02:45:26.987 --> 02:45:29.408]  And then they just, they use everything after I did not say.
[02:45:29.408 --> 02:45:30.329]  I did, literally.
[02:45:31.218 --> 02:45:38.321]  And so, they've also... I can't show weakness, which I wasn't trying to do before.
[02:45:38.321 --> 02:45:43.063]  I was trying to be journalistic, and now I realize I can't do it, because here's an example.
[02:45:43.063 --> 02:45:52.287]  Before Pizzagate became Pizzagate, I told my crew, and I said on air, this is BS, this is a honeypot to distract off real sex crimes.
[02:45:53.647 --> 02:46:10.539]  Stop covering it and I went on air and said I don't think there's anything going on this pizza place They then took that as weakness and said I'd created it Yeah, and said that I need to be sued and all these things really because you'd spoken about it It's the reason nearly because I've covered news.
[02:46:10.539 --> 02:46:11.640]  I mean, I mean, here's what happened
[02:46:12.665 --> 02:46:18.728]  You had Podesta in the emails and you had Wiener and the Sexy and the Young Girl and all this stuff.
[02:46:18.728 --> 02:46:26.312]  This is, we're breaking this and it's in the news and it's in the WikiLeaks and there's weird spirit cooking and you know, Aleister Crowley stuff.
[02:46:26.312 --> 02:46:28.053]  We're just saying, we're not saying they're killing kids.
[02:46:28.053 --> 02:46:30.314]  They're just, this is creepy.
[02:46:30.314 --> 02:46:40.160]  Then I saw the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN about a week later going, at this pizza place, the alt-right says they're killing kids in a basement.
[02:46:40.871 --> 02:46:44.672]  And I've gone on vacation for a week, and I'm on vacation, and I see us covering it.
[02:46:44.672 --> 02:46:48.834]  I call my folks and I go, I bet there's not even a basement in there.
[02:46:48.834 --> 02:46:52.575]  Pizza's code words for, you know, child porn and stuff, according to FBI files.
[02:46:52.575 --> 02:46:54.196]  They're diverting onto a pizza place.
[02:46:54.196 --> 02:46:55.716]  You watch, it's a honeypot.
[02:46:55.716 --> 02:46:57.117]  Shut this down.
[02:46:57.117 --> 02:47:04.040]  I get back, I say, folks, it's a diversion of what's in the WikiLeaks to say now that everything's this pizza place.
[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:05.320]  I said it's a diversion.
[02:47:05.320 --> 02:47:07.201]  The media then took that as weakness.
[02:47:08.101 --> 02:47:15.332]  And then said, oh, Jones is behind all this, and he's already, he's already retracted.
[02:47:15.332 --> 02:47:22.642]  Then a guy goes in there with a gun, supposedly shoots a hole in the ceiling, and then they all say, Jones caused this separate deal, Sandy Hook.
[02:47:22.642 --> 02:47:23.643]  I'm genuinely...
[02:47:25.216 --> 02:47:31.681]  You know, looking at Sandy Hook, and my listeners, one thing I've learned is not be bullied by your listeners.
[02:47:31.681 --> 02:47:37.205]  They got really piffed when that happened five years ago or whatever, and said, Alex, it's all fake, it's all actors.
[02:47:37.205 --> 02:47:45.531]  And I said, no, there's real school shootings, and this guy's on Prozac drugs, and, you know, he wasn't supposed to legally get a gun, and they're like, no, it's staged.
[02:47:45.531 --> 02:47:47.953]  Because there was green screen with Anderson Cooper.
[02:47:47.953 --> 02:47:51.556]  I'm like, yeah, but Anderson Cooper's faked locations before, it doesn't mean it's all fake.
[02:47:51.556 --> 02:47:53.918]  And then, and so I looked at both sides and had debates.
[02:47:55.259 --> 02:48:01.886]  And then the media took the fact that I finally said about three years ago, no, I think kids died there.
[02:48:01.886 --> 02:48:07.131]  They then went, oh, look, he created it and he's backtracking on it.
[02:48:07.131 --> 02:48:09.573]  And then even when I told Megyn Kelly, I said, I think the kids died there.
[02:48:10.453 --> 02:48:15.516]  She wouldn't put it in the piece because now it's almost like I killed the kids.
[02:48:15.516 --> 02:48:18.097]  It's like he's the guy that didn't care about dead kids.
[02:48:18.097 --> 02:48:21.339]  He's the guy that said all this when I never said it or did it.
[02:48:21.339 --> 02:48:26.562]  And again, they edit the tapes and it's the same thing with the whole situation with Pizzagate.
[02:48:26.562 --> 02:48:28.042]  I said, I don't know in a live piece.
[02:48:28.042 --> 02:48:28.863]  I said, I don't know if Hillary.
[02:48:30.086 --> 02:48:33.587]  Hurt kids or killed kids with this, you know, Podesta email stuff.
[02:48:33.587 --> 02:48:36.408]  But I said what I do know is she funded the Arab Spring.
[02:48:36.408 --> 02:48:38.688]  She funded the Libya disaster.
[02:48:38.688 --> 02:48:42.829]  She funded ISIS taking over Syria, as President Trump has said.
[02:48:42.829 --> 02:48:44.649]  And they killed hundreds of thousands of people.
[02:48:44.649 --> 02:48:46.770]  They sold tens of thousands of people into sex slavery.
[02:48:46.770 --> 02:48:49.030]  Hillary Clinton is responsible for this.
[02:48:49.030 --> 02:48:54.912]  Megyn Kelly on Fox edited it together where I said Hillary's killing kids in a basement.
[02:48:55.632 --> 02:48:57.054]  I said, I don't know if she's doing that.
[02:48:57.054 --> 02:48:58.035]  It's probably made up.
[02:48:58.035 --> 02:48:58.855]  But I know she did that.
[02:48:58.855 --> 02:49:00.877]  They edited that with audio.
[02:49:00.877 --> 02:49:01.898]  There was video.
[02:49:01.898 --> 02:49:06.843]  They edited it together to say Hillary's killing kids in the bottom of a pizza place.
[02:49:06.843 --> 02:49:10.467]  See, at a certain point, I go, would I do things differently?
[02:49:10.467 --> 02:49:11.148]  Yeah, I would.
[02:49:11.148 --> 02:49:14.871]  But you can't do things differently when they're going to take this interview and edit it.
[02:49:15.572 --> 02:49:26.242]  The public has to come to their own realization that if you see cut, cut, cut and back and forth and stuff, you need, when you see jump cuts, you need to go look at it or not believe what you've seen.
[02:49:26.242 --> 02:49:26.703]  Yeah.
[02:49:26.703 --> 02:49:27.824]  I know I'm ranting, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:49:27.824 --> 02:49:30.206]  No, I think it's very, I think that's reasonable.
[02:49:30.206 --> 02:49:32.789]  The thing for me, I think what you do is process journalism.
[02:49:33.269 --> 02:49:40.134]  And I think that the only difference between what you do and what some people on the left do, is that you have the wrong politics.
[02:49:40.134 --> 02:49:47.178]  Process journalism, let's say in the tech industry, they've got like TechCrunch, which is a blog that covers Silicon Valley, like funding stories and all the rest of it.
[02:49:47.178 --> 02:49:50.921]  They're completely brazen about publishing rumours as fact.
[02:49:50.921 --> 02:49:54.843]  Publishing rumours in the investment community as news, right?
[02:49:54.843 --> 02:49:56.464]  Terrible track record.
[02:49:56.464 --> 02:49:58.786]  Founder, Michael Arrington, completely unashamed about it.
[02:49:58.786 --> 02:50:00.387]  Which is really pump and dump being hidden.
[02:50:01.527 --> 02:50:02.328]  Well, yes, yeah.
[02:50:02.328 --> 02:50:05.010]  There's a whole other thing, but sure, it is.
[02:50:05.010 --> 02:50:07.291]  And they're completely brazen about it.
[02:50:07.291 --> 02:50:10.173]  And he invented this whole kind of thing, what's called process journalism.
[02:50:10.173 --> 02:50:12.554]  We just do what we know at the time.
[02:50:12.554 --> 02:50:16.657]  And this is, you know, the never wrong for long principle in 24-hour rolling.
[02:50:16.657 --> 02:50:21.420]  Sure, we jump on it and then we change it as we're... You know, and we'll update it as and when we get... Well, I mean, I'll be honest.
[02:50:21.420 --> 02:50:22.220]  That's what we do.
[02:50:22.220 --> 02:50:23.181]  We're live on air.
[02:50:23.181 --> 02:50:24.101]  We don't know.
[02:50:24.101 --> 02:50:25.182]  We look at the available facts.
[02:50:25.182 --> 02:50:26.883]  We speculate and we say what we're speculating.
[02:50:26.923 --> 02:50:30.585]  The thing that I'm interested in is the hypocrisy, and it's the double standards.
[02:50:30.585 --> 02:50:32.446]  In all things, that's what I'm always looking for.
[02:50:32.446 --> 02:50:37.308]  It seems to me that, okay, Infowars has got some things wrong.
[02:50:37.308 --> 02:50:40.170]  Like every other journalistic organization in the country, every one.
[02:50:40.170 --> 02:50:47.814]  But like Breitbart, Infowars seems to be, and I think they're very different organizations, but it seems to be under a unique kind of scrutiny.
[02:50:51.337 --> 02:50:53.900]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[02:50:53.900 --> 02:50:56.042]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[02:50:56.042 --> 02:50:58.024]  Are you happy paying high prices?

[02:51:56.065 --> 02:51:58.906]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:51:58.906 --> 02:52:00.888]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:52:00.888 --> 02:52:05.711]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.

[02:52:09.216 --> 02:52:14.323]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:52:14.323 --> 02:52:21.052]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.

[02:53:38.222 --> 02:53:39.562]  What if I say I'm not like the others?
[02:53:39.562 --> 02:53:42.383]  What if I say I'm just another one in your place?
[02:53:42.383 --> 02:53:43.744]  You're the pretender.
[02:54:07.643 --> 02:54:25.912]  Like Breitbart, Infowars seems to be, and I think they're very different organizations, but it seems to be under a unique kind of scrutiny, where when you get something wrong, or you adjust a previous statement, it becomes like a, it's like a meltdown, it's like a thermonuclear bomb goes off, suddenly it's some massive thing.
[02:54:25.912 --> 02:54:29.474]  But when CNN doesn't just get things wrong, but it seems to me,
[02:54:29.974 --> 02:54:30.414]  I don't
[02:54:45.370 --> 02:54:53.397]  To the best, as best I can work out, as best I can tell, and I've hung around you a little bit, we've met a couple of times, been on the show now, I believe that you are sincere.
[02:54:53.397 --> 02:54:56.340]  I believe that you're a sincere, earnest and decent person.
[02:54:56.340 --> 02:55:01.865]  The best I can tell is that you do, that you're equivalent of 24-hour rolling news coverage.
[02:55:02.485 --> 02:55:16.620]  And you free will, and you spitball, and you say what's going on, and you say it like you see it, you look at what's out there, and you have a sort of continuous rolling adjustment attitude just like the rest of 24-hour news ecosystem elsewhere.
[02:55:16.620 --> 02:55:18.442]  Exactly, and we respond to all listeners.
[02:55:18.442 --> 02:55:20.024]  But you're not judged the same at all.
[02:55:20.024 --> 02:55:23.047]  No, no, and I mean that's really it, is that
[02:55:24.208 --> 02:55:26.710]  CNN and all these guys get caught lying on purpose.
[02:55:26.710 --> 02:55:27.851]  But they do it on purpose.
[02:55:27.851 --> 02:55:28.832]  You don't do it on purpose.
[02:55:28.832 --> 02:55:31.234]  And I don't believe you lie to your viewers on purpose.
[02:55:31.234 --> 02:55:34.076]  No, we've certainly made plenty of mistakes.
[02:55:34.076 --> 02:55:40.601]  And... I mean, I'm not saying I've watched, I'm not saying I've watched, you know, more than maybe 30, 40 shows, right?
[02:55:40.601 --> 02:55:42.222]  But I have watched 30, 40 shows.
[02:55:42.222 --> 02:55:44.123]  I don't believe that you lie to your viewers on purpose.
[02:55:44.123 --> 02:55:45.264]  Well, you were there with me today.
[02:55:45.264 --> 02:55:47.246]  I do think CNN does.
[02:55:47.246 --> 02:55:48.066]  Oh, well, they've been caught.
[02:55:48.066 --> 02:55:52.210]  I mean, they're in the WikiLeaks fixing the debates, fixing polls,
[02:55:52.910 --> 02:55:55.933]  Having Hillary direct them on what they're supposed to do.
[02:55:55.933 --> 02:55:58.456]  It's supposed to be game over at that point.
[02:55:58.456 --> 02:56:03.381]  And then now you've got CNN caught in all these new lies and new deception.
[02:56:03.381 --> 02:56:04.603]  But see, they know that.
[02:56:04.603 --> 02:56:07.886]  So now all they are is disruptors.
[02:56:07.886 --> 02:56:10.949]  And now all they do is fights with those of us that are still
[02:56:13.777 --> 02:56:14.258]  Important.
[02:56:28.897 --> 02:56:30.858]  I think so too.
[02:56:30.858 --> 02:56:39.201]  I think very often people accuse their enemies of exactly the opposite of what they know them really to be.
[02:56:39.201 --> 02:56:46.423]  And I also think that people accuse others of what they most fear might be true about themselves, which is, I think, at the heart of the whole fake news thing.
[02:56:46.423 --> 02:56:52.305]  You know, the reason that the left invented fake news is that they were becoming aware of the fact that they were lying to people.
[02:56:52.305 --> 02:56:54.086]  And now CNN says stop using it.
[02:56:54.446 --> 02:56:55.306]  Yeah, no, no.
[02:56:55.306 --> 02:57:00.688]  Oh, this has backfired on us because you've realized the trick we're up to, so please stop using this expression, fake news.
[02:57:00.688 --> 02:57:01.128]  No.
[02:57:01.128 --> 02:57:12.091]  Now, I, um, you have been accused of being insincere and being an actor and being, uh, fake with people.
[02:57:12.091 --> 02:57:14.192]  Does it hurt?
[02:57:14.192 --> 02:57:21.954]  No, because I'm so sincere that they have to attack my strength, just like they did in the custody trial for my children,
[02:57:22.867 --> 02:57:42.357]  The media was all there, called in by the lawyers on the other side, and they wanted to introduce somebody from like six, seven years ago, where I dressed up like the Joker, and said, take Prozac, you know, drink the fluoride, it's gonna kill you, you're gonna see pretty colors, and I acted totally psychotic, and my lawyer said, this is unadmissible, this is like,
[02:57:43.803 --> 02:57:47.725]  Jack Nicholson playing the part of the Joker and them saying that's who he is.
[02:57:47.725 --> 02:57:51.206]  Clearly I was being an actor in that role.
[02:57:51.206 --> 02:57:54.508]  Anyone could watch it and tell I was dressed up like the Joker.
[02:57:54.508 --> 02:57:55.968]  That's not Alex Jones.
[02:57:55.968 --> 02:57:57.429]  That's me having some fun.
[02:57:57.429 --> 02:57:59.030]  Alex Jones playing a character.
[02:57:59.030 --> 02:57:59.530]  Yeah.
[02:57:59.530 --> 02:58:03.692]  And they're taking the words of the character as being your sincere statement.
[02:58:03.692 --> 02:58:06.693]  Well, then they tried to say those are his sincere statements.
[02:58:06.693 --> 02:58:08.814]  So we said no, I'm being an actor.
[02:58:08.814 --> 02:58:10.055]  They went, oh, it's all an act.
[02:58:10.990 --> 02:58:19.437]  And it's like saying, no, if I'm in a college play, playing Captain Ahab on Moby Dick, I'm not really a captain.
[02:58:19.437 --> 02:58:24.681]  I'm not really obsessed with the role.
[02:58:24.681 --> 02:58:26.963]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:26.963 --> 02:58:28.404]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:41.812 --> 02:58:48.613]  As most of you already, today I'm excited to announce that a new limited shipment of DNA Force has finally arrived at the M4's warehouse in Austin, Texas.
[02:58:48.613 --> 02:58:54.675]  We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed up for auto-ship to receive out-of-stock products at DNA Force.
[02:58:54.675 --> 02:58:57.175]  And we are now once again expected to sell out very, very soon.
[02:58:57.175 --> 02:59:04.937]  And when it comes to a formula that is such a game-changer like DNA Force, we never know when we will be able to secure an additional supply of the key ingredients.
[02:59:05.157 --> 02:59:14.704]  The secret behind DNA Force is its powerful lineup of patented ingredients like CoQ10, systematic enzymes, NAR lipoic acid, BioPQQ, and many others.
[02:59:14.704 --> 02:59:23.191]  BioPQQ alone is backed by an unprecedented 175 clinical studies, and just one batch of this stuff costs us more than $30,000.
[02:59:23.191 --> 02:59:25.913]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com and read the reviews for yourself.
[02:59:25.913 --> 02:59:33.759]  Over 700 reviews have given DNA Force an unheard of 4.8 out of 5 stars through our third-party certified review agency, Power Review.
[02:59:34.039 --> 02:59:39.585]  Take advantage of this new limited shipment and get DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com before it sells out again.
[02:59:39.585 --> 02:59:44.811]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:44.811 --> 02:59:47.414]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.023 --> 03:00:05.594]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[03:00:05.594 --> 03:00:08.259]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:12.253 --> 03:00:16.074]  College play, you know, playing Captain Ahab on Moby Dick.
[03:00:16.074 --> 03:00:17.414]  I'm not really a captain.
[03:00:17.414 --> 03:00:19.175]  I'm not really obsessed with the will.
[03:00:19.175 --> 03:00:21.815]  But I'm also not faking the rest of my life.
[03:00:21.815 --> 03:00:31.598]  Like, when I'm being an actor or saying a joke, saying, you know, that I want to marry Glenn Beck, like we were doing on the show, that's clearly joke time.
[03:00:31.598 --> 03:00:39.360]  But then when I read a Wall Street Journal article saying that they've got a grand jury impaled against Trump, that's real.
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:40.600]  And I'm showing you the article.
[03:00:41.360 --> 03:00:45.664]  So again, they play these games hoping that their audience isn't paying attention.
[03:00:45.664 --> 03:00:47.186]  It doesn't affect you?
[03:00:47.186 --> 03:00:47.686]  Emotionally?
[03:00:47.686 --> 03:00:48.407]  No, it doesn't.
[03:00:48.407 --> 03:00:53.913]  It frustrates me that there's people this corrupt that would continue to organize themselves like this.
[03:00:53.913 --> 03:00:57.676]  Seems to be more fuel for your fire, you know.
[03:00:57.676 --> 03:01:02.841]  Maybe it doesn't upset you personally that people would say that about you, but it adds more grist to the mill.
[03:01:02.841 --> 03:01:03.522]  Exactly.
[03:01:03.522 --> 03:01:05.144]  I want to go show where they're liars.
[03:01:05.564 --> 03:01:05.965]  Right.
[03:01:05.965 --> 03:01:08.447]  And it just makes you even more determined.
[03:01:08.447 --> 03:01:10.349]  And this, I think, is the Trump instinct.
[03:01:10.349 --> 03:01:11.310]  It's the Breitbart instinct.
[03:01:11.310 --> 03:01:19.077]  It's this new populist, nationalist, fearless revolution against the cultural commissars.
[03:01:19.077 --> 03:01:19.677]  Well, exactly.
[03:01:19.677 --> 03:01:23.901]  The cultural commissars... What we all have in common, as different as we all are, is that
[03:01:24.642 --> 03:01:26.604]  Defiance and net determination.
[03:01:26.604 --> 03:01:30.008]  Defiance is key, and leadership.
[03:01:30.008 --> 03:01:34.973]  Realizing we're promoting Magna Carta, Renaissance, 1776, what works.
[03:01:34.973 --> 03:01:39.998]  The big, sexy, big-titted hit that Robert Duvall talks about at Network.
[03:01:39.998 --> 03:01:40.839]  You know, we got a big-titted hit!
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:56.212]  I mean, America, freedom, thousands of choices of everything, incredible diversity, true liberalism, this mosaic of cultures coming together and the best coming out of each group and mixing together.
[03:01:56.212 --> 03:02:03.278]  That's true liberalism, not a bunch of weirdos managing all these groups and making them all neurotic and fighting with each other.
[03:02:04.639 --> 03:02:28.804]  That what sexy is America is the diversity and people go oh well this wasn't diverse in America's history well it was a lot more diverse than anybody else that you know they come to the most diverse transcendent group knowing we have a conscience and knowing we're liberal and then try to make us feel bad going oh look you did all these bad things no one will go oh my god we did those things instead of saying you're the best there ever was let's take this to the next level
[03:02:29.284 --> 03:02:32.066]  This is a bit like... I'm an American cultist.
[03:02:32.066 --> 03:02:33.607]  I'm a Renaissance cultist.
[03:02:33.607 --> 03:02:35.488]  I'm a cult member of freedom.
[03:02:35.488 --> 03:02:35.968]  I like that.
[03:02:35.968 --> 03:02:41.171]  I mean, I'm so liberal growing up my whole life that I don't even think about what color somebody is or what their sexual preferences are.
[03:02:41.171 --> 03:02:44.213]  It's what they actually produce, what they stand for, and how they treat me.
[03:02:44.213 --> 03:02:45.694]  I don't even look at it.
[03:02:45.694 --> 03:02:46.575]  I mean, I was growing up...
[03:02:47.515 --> 03:02:53.256]  In Dallas, not even understanding that a group of racist black guys would come over and try to beat me up because I was white.
[03:02:53.256 --> 03:02:54.657]  I just thought those were mean black guys.
[03:02:54.657 --> 03:03:00.238]  Or a group of redneck guys because, you know, they were a gang of white guys and I was with a hot girl would come up and try to beat me up.
[03:03:00.238 --> 03:03:01.858]  That's how humans act in gangs.
[03:03:01.858 --> 03:03:06.019]  Now through sociology, anthropology, psychology, I can look back and see what actually happened.
[03:03:06.019 --> 03:03:15.521]  But I was such a purist then of just being a human that I did not, as a tribalist, think that these were tribal groups attacking me because to me they were just other humans.
[03:03:16.181 --> 03:03:20.003]  They were bad people, but I didn't see them for what color they were.
[03:03:20.003 --> 03:03:26.247]  Only later did I see they were operating in a gang mentality.
[03:03:26.247 --> 03:03:27.187]  Does that make sense?
[03:03:27.187 --> 03:03:27.768]  Yeah, it does.
[03:03:28.959 --> 03:03:33.862]  You've had plenty of experience watching how the media operates, to be sceptical of them.
[03:03:33.862 --> 03:03:42.408]  But I sense in you, in addition to that, a sort of deep antipathy toward authority figures in general.
[03:03:42.408 --> 03:03:47.072]  That's a scepticism about people who think they know better than you do, how you should lead your life.
[03:03:47.632 --> 03:03:54.696]  Whether it's academics, journalists, Hollywood producers, you seem to have a sort of default position.
[03:03:54.696 --> 03:03:56.216]  And I share it with you, to be clear.
[03:03:56.216 --> 03:03:57.577]  I have the same thing.
[03:03:57.577 --> 03:04:03.720]  You have a default position of skepticism and you tend to look for ulterior motives.
[03:04:05.661 --> 03:04:07.484]  With any authority figure.
[03:04:07.484 --> 03:04:08.705]  And I share this with you.
[03:04:08.705 --> 03:04:11.209]  And I don't know why I am like that.
[03:04:11.209 --> 03:04:13.792]  But do you have any insight as to why you might be like that?
[03:04:13.792 --> 03:04:19.640]  Is there an event or a person in your life that might have made you that way?
[03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:21.763]  Because it's what's made you so interesting to watch.
[03:04:21.863 --> 03:04:29.009]  Because you're always immediately looking, as any great journalist is really, you know, you're always immediately looking for the story behind the story.
[03:04:29.009 --> 03:04:35.473]  When I watch InfoWars, what I see you doing is taking this and then, right, okay, but how did this come to pass?
[03:04:35.473 --> 03:04:36.955]  Who's responsible for this?
[03:04:36.955 --> 03:04:38.236]  What are the inner workings?
[03:04:38.236 --> 03:04:43.359]  You're always looking, you know, a couple of layers beyond the surface story.
[03:04:43.359 --> 03:04:44.941]  Well sure, why are we being presented this?
[03:04:48.420 --> 03:04:49.842]  Why is the fungus?
[03:04:49.842 --> 03:04:50.923]  Why is the mold?
[03:04:50.923 --> 03:04:52.666]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[03:04:52.666 --> 03:04:53.627]  What is going on?
[03:04:53.627 --> 03:04:54.388]  What has changed?
[03:05:02.739 --> 03:05:10.024]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[03:05:10.024 --> 03:05:11.785]  It's available at infomorestore.com.
[03:05:11.785 --> 03:05:14.948]  It's got free shipping, orders for $50 or more and 10% off.
[03:05:14.948 --> 03:05:17.409]  You sign up for auto-ship additionally on top of that.
[03:05:17.409 --> 03:05:17.810]  Please!
[03:05:18.670 --> 03:05:20.091]  We only have a limited supply of this.
[03:05:20.091 --> 03:05:22.093]  I want to get your reviews on here, what you have to say.
[03:05:22.093 --> 03:05:23.554]  For me, it's been incredible.
[03:05:23.554 --> 03:05:28.077]  MycoZX, antifungal, uh, antifungus, uh, anti-yeast.
[03:05:28.077 --> 03:05:28.797]  Get it today.
[03:05:28.797 --> 03:05:29.378]  Limited run.
[03:05:29.378 --> 03:05:30.799]  It'll be months till we get more.
[03:05:30.799 --> 03:05:35.462]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:05:35.462 --> 03:05:38.805]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[03:05:38.805 --> 03:05:41.126]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[03:05:41.126 --> 03:05:43.028]  Look at the response we're getting.
[03:05:43.028 --> 03:05:44.489]  We're changing the world together.
[03:05:44.489 --> 03:05:45.489]  You are the Infowar.
[03:05:45.489 --> 03:05:46.250]  God bless you all.
[03:05:49.444 --> 03:05:53.207]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:05:53.207 --> 03:06:00.952]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:06:00.952 --> 03:06:09.558]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:06:09.558 --> 03:06:19.224]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[03:06:19.564 --> 03:06:23.806]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:06:23.806 --> 03:06:27.227]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:06:27.227 --> 03:06:38.351]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:06:38.351 --> 03:06:41.272]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[03:06:41.272 --> 03:06:47.255]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[03:06:48.300 --> 03:06:56.568]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[03:06:56.568 --> 03:06:57.790]  A 360 win.
[03:06:57.790 --> 03:07:04.356]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[03:07:04.356 --> 03:07:09.021]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip
[03:07:09.121 --> 03:07:12.263]  Because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[03:07:12.263 --> 03:07:17.346]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[03:07:17.346 --> 03:07:23.451]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[03:07:23.451 --> 03:07:31.256]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[03:07:31.256 --> 03:07:37.680]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[03:07:39.421 --> 03:07:41.844]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:41.844 --> 03:07:43.826]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[03:07:43.826 --> 03:07:49.831]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[03:07:49.831 --> 03:07:55.457]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen.
[03:07:55.457 --> 03:07:58.820]  Right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:58.820 --> 03:08:01.543]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:08:05.939 --> 03:08:10.902]  Hello, I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for my good friend Alex Jones.
[03:08:10.902 --> 03:08:20.509]  You can catch the rest of that extraordinary interview between my friend Milo and Alex Jones by going to Milo's YouTube page or the InfoWars YouTube page.
[03:08:20.509 --> 03:08:22.670]  I know I want to see the rest of it.
[03:08:22.670 --> 03:08:33.898]  It is not lost on me that last week when he appeared here on InfoWars, my friend Milo wore a vintage, genuine Bill Clinton rape whistle.
[03:08:34.919 --> 03:08:38.541]  A true piece of art.
[03:08:38.541 --> 03:08:44.745]  This is an extraordinary time to be alive because we have seen the real Donald Trump.
[03:08:44.745 --> 03:08:46.666]  And I like what I see.
[03:08:46.666 --> 03:08:55.913]  You see, first, the president very quickly put out an appropriate statement regarding the tragedy in Charlottesville.
[03:08:55.913 --> 03:08:58.334]  But that did not satisfy his critics.
[03:08:58.334 --> 03:09:00.636]  He denounced bigotry and hate.
[03:09:00.636 --> 03:09:02.477]  But you see, that was not sufficient.
[03:09:03.104 --> 03:09:11.128]  They demanded that he denounce specific groups, including white supremacists, of whom I do not know any.
[03:09:11.128 --> 03:09:17.190]  So I suspect this is a rather small but vocal group of haters.
[03:09:17.190 --> 03:09:22.593]  He did that, and then his critics wanted to know what took him so long.
[03:09:23.494 --> 03:09:27.456]  The truth is Donald Trump cannot please his critics.
[03:09:27.456 --> 03:09:35.479]  And then he finally fed up, had that moment of truth where he said, wait a minute, there's plenty of blame to go around here.
[03:09:35.479 --> 03:09:41.882]  Those who expose, those who condone, those who perpetrate violence on the left.
[03:09:42.322 --> 03:09:51.970]  The most violent elements of the Black Lives Matter movement, for example, they are equally responsible for the climate in America.
[03:09:51.970 --> 03:09:58.955]  They are equally to be denounced and rejected as violence is never a solution.
[03:09:59.776 --> 03:10:13.840]  Now, the more one examines the events of Charlottesville, anyone who's an experienced political operative who understands agate prop, things begin to seem quite fishy.
[03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:22.942]  I don't deny that there probably were a few neo-Nazis and Klansmen interspersed through the mob for authenticity.
[03:10:23.462 --> 03:10:31.966]  But this has the absolute feel of an AstroTurf effort by the Soros Ops.
[03:10:31.966 --> 03:10:45.172]  Jason Kessler, who appears to be the chief organizer, is identified now as a white supremacist, but not very long ago he was an ardent Obama supporter and working in the Occupy demonstrations.
[03:10:46.032 --> 03:11:04.602]  I still have my investigation underway, but others with key ties who are allegedly now Klansmen or skinheads or neo-Nazis have very strange recent activities of activism, I should say, on the political left.
[03:11:04.602 --> 03:11:14.587]  Then what are we to make of the Craigslist ad that was found in Charlottesville soliciting actors for an outside drama?
[03:11:15.659 --> 03:11:37.029]  This is beginning to be precisely what WikiLeaks showed us happened in the campaign, where George Soros and his ilk financed guerrilla operations and dirty tricks operations to foment violence at the Trump rallies so that Trump could be blamed for the violence.
[03:11:37.862 --> 03:11:43.116]  That's precisely what is going on in Charlottesville.
[03:11:43.116 --> 03:11:44.961]  And the president raises a good point.
[03:11:46.711 --> 03:11:58.835]  It's interesting because if you start by tearing down statues of Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis, George Washington was in fact a slaveholder.
[03:11:58.835 --> 03:12:10.238]  Do you tear his statue down, to which one black journalist I was reading to the other day said, yes, not going to happen.
[03:12:11.079 --> 03:12:27.424]  So let us now turn to the Trump White House, where the cabal of the generals, what I call the seven days in May crew, is very much in control, where General H.R.
[03:12:27.424 --> 03:12:28.144]  McMaster
[03:12:29.086 --> 03:12:42.138]  Who looks amazingly to me like Don Rickles, by the way, is in an alliance with White House Chief John Kelly, reminds me very much of General Alexander Haig.
[03:12:42.138 --> 03:12:53.708]  And they are believed to be allied with General Mad Dog Mattis, the first non-civilian Defense Secretary in modern times.
[03:12:55.133 --> 03:13:16.572]  This triumvirate, which is most internationalist and globalist in its own coloration, was responsible for the ouster of Anthony Scaramucci, in that case with the active assistant of presidential strategist Steve Bannon.
[03:13:16.572 --> 03:13:21.456]  Now, unfortunately, Scaramucci's real sin was access to the president.
[03:13:22.077 --> 03:13:27.916]  It's incumbent now on Kelly who's attempting to crack down to control all information in and out.
[03:13:28.522 --> 03:13:53.045]  To the president or to the point where Ivanka and Jared now must communicate through General Kelly and neither one of them are allowed to meet with the president alone, nor can they just walk in to to the president's office during, as was the case during the chaos in which Reince Priebus was running the show.
[03:13:54.538 --> 03:14:02.442]  Therefore, you have now a dynamic in which the generals will seek to oust Steve Bannon.
[03:14:02.442 --> 03:14:10.605]  Now, I have been one who has defended Bannon against charges of anti-Semitism or bigotry or white supremacy.
[03:14:10.605 --> 03:14:11.646]  These are falsehoods.
[03:14:12.667 --> 03:14:15.190]  But I believe he's a spent volcano.
[03:14:15.190 --> 03:14:22.778]  He has not stepped up, first in the personnel process, not understanding that personnel is policy.
[03:14:22.778 --> 03:14:27.944]  He helped no other Trump loyalists get inside the White House walls.
[03:14:27.944 --> 03:14:31.108]  Now he finds himself facing the globalists alone.
[03:14:32.105 --> 03:14:42.755]  He also, unfortunately, was the prime mover in the appointment of Rex Tillerson as our Secretary of State.
[03:14:42.755 --> 03:14:53.105]  Steve Bannon knew that Tillerson's chief patron was Condoleezza Rice, and that Rice had recommended Tillerson face-to-face with the President in a meeting in New York.
[03:14:54.483 --> 03:14:58.507]  Yet, we pushed the appointment of Tillotson.
[03:14:58.507 --> 03:15:04.733]  Rice and the Romneyites now dominate the Trump State Department.
[03:15:04.733 --> 03:15:16.003]  The pressure to remove the Soros people from embassies across Eastern Europe is ignored in the Tillotson State Department.
[03:15:16.924 --> 03:15:21.027]  This is another example of what Steve Bannon has given us.
[03:15:21.027 --> 03:15:32.855]  I am deeply disappointed that he didn't tell the President that Joe Arpaio was being unfairly prosecuted, and that prosecution should be halted.
[03:15:32.855 --> 03:15:44.584]  Steve Bannon, who came up with a higher tax proposal, which Larry Kudlow and the other growth experts said would be a disaster for the Trump economic revolution.
[03:15:45.184 --> 03:15:50.766]  So, it is not that I do not have affection for Mr. Bannon and his roguish style.
[03:15:50.766 --> 03:16:02.389]  I named him as one of the worst dressed people in the world in my 2015 Mr. Stone's Best and Worst Dressed list.
[03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:08.591]  Steve wore it like a badge, showing his friends the man does in fact dress like a hobo.
[03:16:09.710 --> 03:16:22.824]  But I think the point here is that the generals will now take Stephen Bannon out, regardless of what Roger Stone thinks one way or another, for the same reason that Scaramucci had to be removed.
[03:16:22.824 --> 03:16:26.288]  It's because of Steve's independent access to the president.
[03:16:27.375 --> 03:16:47.917]  The generals, the Seven Days in May crowd, those who are closely aligned with individuals like Robert Mueller and James Comey and the permanent Washington two-party duopoly establishment, still have, in essence, a slow-motion coup afoot.
[03:16:48.812 --> 03:17:02.599]  The idea here is to seize control of all information, render the president impotent, and set him up for a takedown by the Lord High Executioner of the establishment.
[03:17:02.599 --> 03:17:05.241]  That's what's really going on in Washington.
[03:17:06.216 --> 03:17:15.960]  I do want to take a moment to talk to you about the fact that we need your support to keep these kind of breaking news stories front and center here at InfoWars.

[03:19:27.359 --> 03:19:37.105]  These are crucial to move this product to help us finance the expansion that Alex Jones knows will make InfoWars even better.
[03:19:37.105 --> 03:19:39.607]  I'm Roger Stone, and I'll be right back.

[03:23:48.427 --> 03:23:49.967]  Welcome back.
[03:23:49.967 --> 03:23:55.629]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:23:55.629 --> 03:24:01.671]  And like you, I'm intently watching the drama that is going forward in Washington.
[03:24:19.766 --> 03:24:34.538]  I have recently been approached by the lawyers for the House Intelligence Committee, and we are tentatively focused on testimony on September 20, pardon me, yes, on September 26.
[03:24:34.538 --> 03:24:49.009]  The terms of that are not yet set, but I am anxious to help clear the air on the Russian collusion, delusion.
[03:24:50.072 --> 03:24:57.856]  The truth is that there was collusion by a foreign nation in our most recent presidential election.
[03:24:57.856 --> 03:25:01.778]  That would be the nation of Ukraine.
[03:25:01.778 --> 03:25:05.440]  Ukraine was illegally helping Hillary Clinton.
[03:25:05.440 --> 03:25:17.687]  Ukrainian intelligence was forging documents to smear Paul Manafort, even though prosecutors in Ukraine admit today that he has done nothing wrong or illegal in the country.
[03:25:18.591 --> 03:25:29.965]  But now we learn that these very same Ukrainians have sold missile technology to the North Koreans to make their weapons more accurate and more stable.
[03:25:31.241 --> 03:25:38.945]  So in other words, Hillary Clinton colluded with the Ukrainians to steal this election.
[03:25:38.945 --> 03:25:43.508]  Later in the week, I'll be talking to... Sorry, we're active here at the Bureau.
[03:25:43.508 --> 03:25:45.849]  I apologize.
[03:25:45.849 --> 03:25:58.116]  I have Lee Stranahan will join me to lay out in chapter and verse what exactly is going on in terms of the lack of public focus
[03:25:58.776 --> 03:26:08.722]  And investigation into the illegal activities between the Ukrainians and the Clinton campaign.
[03:26:08.722 --> 03:26:15.867]  Unlike the Russian claims, here there is enormous proof of said collusion.
[03:26:16.949 --> 03:26:24.153]  On the other hand, collusion with foreign elections of foreign countries abroad is not unheard of.
[03:26:24.153 --> 03:26:34.778]  We interfered in the Russian election, spending money and agate prop in order to elect Boris Yeltsin.
[03:26:34.778 --> 03:26:42.582]  Yet, to this day, not a scintilla, not a shred of evidence of improper conduct
[03:26:43.286 --> 03:26:48.909]  By anyone in the Trump campaign involving the Russians has been proven.
[03:26:48.909 --> 03:26:51.971]  The meetings between Donald Trump Jr.
[03:26:51.971 --> 03:27:00.275]  and a growing cast of Russians seems to be a Keystone Cops drama, but there's no violation of the law there.
[03:27:00.275 --> 03:27:03.017]  Nothing of value exchanges hands.
[03:27:03.017 --> 03:27:09.961]  There are many questions about how the woman Russian lawyer even got into the country without a visa.
[03:27:09.961 --> 03:27:11.762]  Why would the FBI help her do so?
[03:27:12.462 --> 03:27:25.070]  And then there is the question of why she's pictured at a Hillary Clinton rally, and then later again in the office of Senator John McCain.
[03:27:25.070 --> 03:27:34.856]  No, Russia has fallen flat as a pancake for the left, so now they are shifting to their second favorite attack vehicle, race.
[03:27:36.064 --> 03:28:00.070]  Now, that is unfortunate, but I think you're going to find that the country agrees with the president when it comes to condemning hateful demonstrators, protesters, or thugs of the left, and they must be denounced just as much as those rabble-rousers on the right.
[03:28:01.571 --> 03:28:04.493]  Please do me a favor, folks, and help us here.
[03:28:04.493 --> 03:28:06.635]  Stay ahead of the news curve.
[03:28:06.635 --> 03:28:07.916]  Help us with our expansion.

[03:28:11.139 --> 03:28:15.942]  You've got the 1776 sale on, which is extraordinary.
[03:28:15.942 --> 03:28:17.864]  We're talking about Brain Force Plus.
[03:28:17.864 --> 03:28:20.646]  We're talking about Survival Shield X2.
[03:28:20.646 --> 03:28:22.988]  We're talking about Bio True Selenium.
[03:28:23.826 --> 03:28:25.768]  You've got the new Super Blue Mouthwash.
[03:28:25.768 --> 03:28:27.429]  My grandson loves this.
[03:28:27.429 --> 03:28:27.469]  $17.76.
[03:28:27.469 --> 03:28:29.952]  Silver Bullet.
[03:28:29.952 --> 03:28:32.854]  Took up that immune system.
[03:28:32.854 --> 03:28:33.995]  $9.95.
[03:28:33.995 --> 03:28:34.876]  66% off.
[03:28:34.876 --> 03:28:37.579]  You won't see these prices again for a while.
[03:28:37.579 --> 03:28:40.982]  And some of these products really are first-rate.
[03:28:40.982 --> 03:28:42.483]  I've used many of them.
[03:28:42.483 --> 03:28:44.205]  They're popular in the Stone household.
[03:28:45.125 --> 03:28:53.967]  You know, I used to go to the local GNC until I figured out that the quality of the InfoWars store is really first-rate.
[03:28:53.967 --> 03:29:04.690]  Alex Jones, his people don't put anything up for sale on the site which isn't carefully tested to be the best of its genre.
[03:29:04.690 --> 03:29:08.711]  So, sure, you can find, you know, male products, let us say.
[03:29:09.411 --> 03:29:12.372]  In the drugstore, but you will not have this quality.
[03:29:12.372 --> 03:29:13.292]  Help us.
[03:29:13.292 --> 03:29:14.793]  Help us save America.
[03:29:14.793 --> 03:29:15.633]  Help yourself.
[03:29:15.633 --> 03:29:18.354]  Go to the Infowars.com store.
[03:29:18.354 --> 03:29:22.775]  I'm Roger Stone, and we'll be back shortly.
[03:29:22.775 --> 03:29:29.958]  Baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you
[03:29:36.195 --> 03:29:40.142]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:40.142 --> 03:29:42.827]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:48.391 --> 03:29:50.493]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[03:29:50.493 --> 03:29:52.816]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[03:29:52.816 --> 03:29:53.857]  Why we have them.
[03:29:53.857 --> 03:29:57.240]  Why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them.
[03:29:57.240 --> 03:30:02.746]  And why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[03:30:02.746 --> 03:30:09.673]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[03:30:09.773 --> 03:30:20.528]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[03:30:20.528 --> 03:30:24.173]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[03:30:26.055 --> 03:30:33.219]  The original amendments we referred to as the Bill of Rights contained ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[03:30:33.219 --> 03:30:35.860]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[03:30:35.860 --> 03:30:38.722]  It doesn't recognize color, or class, or wealth.
[03:30:38.722 --> 03:30:42.764]  It protects not just the rights of actors, or editors, or reporters,
[03:30:42.844 --> 03:30:45.305]  But extends even to those we love to hate.
[03:30:45.305 --> 03:30:48.247]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[03:30:48.247 --> 03:30:56.973]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[03:30:56.973 --> 03:30:57.493]  That's right.
[03:30:57.493 --> 03:31:02.776]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[03:31:02.776 --> 03:31:09.180]  Go to Infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[03:31:09.420 --> 03:31:17.027]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[03:31:17.027 --> 03:31:17.267]  Woo!
[03:31:17.267 --> 03:31:18.308]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:31:18.308 --> 03:31:27.036]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[03:31:27.036 --> 03:31:35.143]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[03:31:36.624 --> 03:31:40.045]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[03:31:40.045 --> 03:31:44.167]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[03:31:44.167 --> 03:31:45.247]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:31:45.247 --> 03:31:48.468]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:48.468 --> 03:31:53.950]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:31:53.950 --> 03:31:56.031]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:31:56.031 --> 03:32:01.313]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:32:01.313 --> 03:32:05.034]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants that
[03:32:05.174 --> 03:32:08.617]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:32:08.617 --> 03:32:11.800]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:32:11.800 --> 03:32:15.684]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:32:15.684 --> 03:32:22.850]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:32:22.850 --> 03:32:28.996]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[03:32:29.076 --> 03:32:29.696]  I follow America.
[03:32:56.089 --> 03:32:58.435]  Let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:32:58.435 --> 03:33:01.163]  You're listening to Roger Stone.
[03:33:01.163 --> 03:33:02.066]  On and fours.
[03:33:06.638 --> 03:33:08.018]  Welcome back.
[03:33:08.018 --> 03:33:10.059]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:33:10.059 --> 03:33:21.383]  I had the honor of going to Atlanta last weekend for a MAGA Dixie rally sponsored by Citizens for Trump.
[03:33:21.383 --> 03:33:28.125]  And I can say without any question that, and polls reflect this, support for the president
[03:33:29.009 --> 03:33:49.996]  Uh, is at an all time high and the intensity of his support among his supporters, not only has not lost any of its luster as it has with Hillary Clinton, if anything, the president is stronger among Republican primary voters than at any time I have seen an incumbent Republican presidency.
[03:33:51.179 --> 03:34:03.462]  That said, I was really heartened by the extraordinary turnout for the MAGA Rally and the fighting spirit of those who attended.
[03:34:03.462 --> 03:34:11.884]  And you can see my pretty fiery speech and attack on the Deep State by going to StoneColdTruth.com.
[03:34:11.884 --> 03:34:15.485]  I think it's worth your while.
[03:34:15.485 --> 03:34:16.505]  While I was in
[03:34:19.498 --> 03:34:21.159]  Atlanta.
[03:34:21.159 --> 03:34:33.145]  I had the opportunity to endorse the candidacy of Senator Michael Williams, who I believe will be joining us shortly.
[03:34:33.145 --> 03:34:40.109]  Now, I am going to work for Republican candidates in the 2018 cycle.
[03:34:40.109 --> 03:34:45.372]  I'm going to go out and support those who support the president.
[03:34:46.090 --> 03:35:00.242]  Not the country club establishment Republican types who have cut and run on the question of health care, who don't want a corporate income tax cut as large as the president.
[03:35:00.242 --> 03:35:11.151]  I think the only way the president can survive his battle with the Congress is to run against both parties.
[03:35:12.117 --> 03:35:29.188]  To make it clear to the people that he has put forward an aggressive and dynamic program for economic growth, but the two-party duopoly, the Republicans and Democrats working together, have thwarted that plan.
[03:35:30.825 --> 03:35:45.528]  You see, maybe it's Trump triangulation, but he will do himself no good by endorsing the establishment reelection candidacy of candidates like Senator Luther Strange.
[03:35:45.528 --> 03:35:52.350]  Nor should he listen to the party leaders who will tell him that primaries are divisive.
[03:35:52.350 --> 03:36:00.132]  Donald Trump is not a career politician and he doesn't have career politician views or rules.
[03:36:01.315 --> 03:36:18.107]  I would argue that he should target a selected group of incumbents who have been recalcitrant about supporting his program and take the fight right to the Republican establishment.
[03:36:18.107 --> 03:36:23.611]  If he takes a few scalps, if he wins a few preliminary victories, believe me,
[03:36:24.960 --> 03:36:30.224]  Senator Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan will wet their pants.
[03:36:30.224 --> 03:36:43.173]  And now I believe we have solved our technical problems and we are pleased to have join us a gentleman who I think will be the next governor of Georgia, Senator Michael Williams.
[03:36:43.173 --> 03:36:44.954]  Welcome to InfoWars.
[03:36:44.954 --> 03:36:45.595]  Well, thank you, Roger.
[03:36:45.595 --> 03:36:46.996]  It's a pleasure to be here with everybody.
[03:36:48.289 --> 03:36:56.440]  I really want to tell people why I made the trek to Norcos, Georgia, to say a few words on your behalf.
[03:36:56.440 --> 03:37:01.547]  And no, I am not a paid consultant or strategist in your campaign.
[03:37:01.547 --> 03:37:04.672]  I am a free agent and I'm going to help those who helped
[03:37:05.212 --> 03:37:06.213]  The President.
[03:37:06.213 --> 03:37:19.803]  So not only are you a comrade in arms from the Trump campaign, I know an early supporter long before many in the establishment realized his candidacy was real.
[03:37:19.803 --> 03:37:22.745]  But in many ways you remind me of the President.
[03:37:22.745 --> 03:37:27.608]  You didn't come to the State Senate from politics, you came from business.
[03:37:27.608 --> 03:37:32.032]  You didn't come from a political background, you came from an entrepreneurial background.
[03:37:32.953 --> 03:37:34.694]  And I think many people don't know this.
[03:37:34.694 --> 03:37:47.608]  It was only when Obamacare threatened to destroy your business that you made the decision to make the sacrifice with small children, but get into politics and see if you can make a difference.
[03:37:47.608 --> 03:37:53.555]  And that's really why I went to Georgia and why I'm proud to endorse your candidacy.
[03:37:54.341 --> 03:37:56.003]  Yeah, that's absolutely correct, Roger.
[03:37:56.003 --> 03:38:01.348]  I was the first elected official here in Georgia to come out and support the President in September of 2015.
[03:38:01.348 --> 03:38:10.258]  In fact, when he had his first rally in Norcross in October of that month, I was one of the, actually the only candidate, or the only elected official
[03:38:10.798 --> 03:38:12.299]  That spoke at his rally.
[03:38:12.299 --> 03:38:14.039]  Also, you touched on it.
[03:38:14.039 --> 03:38:15.600]  I'm not a career politician.
[03:38:15.600 --> 03:38:16.280]  I'm a business guy.
[03:38:16.280 --> 03:38:18.061]  I'm a CPA by trade.
[03:38:18.061 --> 03:38:21.403]  Used to own 18 barbershops called Sport Clips Haircuts.
[03:38:21.403 --> 03:38:23.203]  Had 160 employees.
[03:38:23.203 --> 03:38:24.464]  Was taking care of my employees.
[03:38:24.464 --> 03:38:31.287]  They were loving their jobs and Obamacare came in and I was just sick and tired of continually fighting the government.
[03:38:32.028 --> 03:38:37.518]  I spent so much of my time dealing with the red tape and fighting government that I ended up selling it and decided, you know what?
[03:38:37.518 --> 03:38:42.908]  I'm fed up with career politicians that say one thing, get elected, and instead of doing what they promised the voters...
[03:38:43.812 --> 03:38:46.654]  They do what the people that finance their campaigns want them to do.
[03:38:46.654 --> 03:38:50.275]  They follow the lobbyists, the special interests, big corporate, and doing their bidding.
[03:38:50.275 --> 03:38:52.016]  So I figured, you know what, I just can't complain about it anymore.
[03:38:52.016 --> 03:38:53.397]  I've got to go out there and do it myself.
[03:38:53.397 --> 03:39:01.341]  So I put about $300,000 into my first campaign, went out there, and to be honest with you, we kicked the ass of the incumbent.
[03:39:01.341 --> 03:39:02.282]  He got his butt beat by 64%.
[03:39:02.282 --> 03:39:02.702]  64 to... 36 to 34%.
[03:39:08.608 --> 03:39:13.471]  Well, you have an amazing and dynamic career so far.
[03:39:13.471 --> 03:39:21.775]  You know, something that Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House aide, said last week on his ABC interview is very true.
[03:39:21.775 --> 03:39:23.416]  Those in the political class
[03:39:24.256 --> 03:39:30.040]  Don't want those from the entrepreneurial business class in the game.
[03:39:30.040 --> 03:39:35.624]  People who have had to make a profit, meet a payroll, pay their taxes.
[03:39:35.624 --> 03:39:38.586]  It's a zero-sum game for these career politicians.
[03:39:38.586 --> 03:39:52.755]  It's all about getting re-elected, being non-controversial, keeping your head down, and as you know with gerrymandering, appealing to the most partisan nature of their constituencies.
[03:39:53.756 --> 03:39:58.239]  You have an experience as a manager, and the race here is about governor.
[03:39:58.239 --> 03:40:03.704]  Governors need to run things, and I get the sense that you would run a tight ship.
[03:40:03.704 --> 03:40:07.306]  Now, they say you're a dark horse.
[03:40:07.306 --> 03:40:09.889]  They say you're the long shot.
[03:40:09.889 --> 03:40:15.253]  But I can tell you, it is not the candidate with the most money who wins.
[03:40:15.253 --> 03:40:19.756]  It is not the candidate with the most establishment endorsements.
[03:40:19.756 --> 03:40:21.558]  How do you think your campaign is going?
[03:40:22.364 --> 03:40:24.565]  I think our campaign is going fantastic.
[03:40:24.565 --> 03:40:25.506]  And you're absolutely right.
[03:40:25.506 --> 03:40:28.707]  They consider us a dark horse that we're kind of the long shot.
[03:40:28.707 --> 03:40:30.828]  But they said that about Donald Trump, too.
[03:40:30.828 --> 03:40:32.029]  They said that he would never win.
[03:40:32.029 --> 03:40:35.751]  He could never beat Jeb Bush and some of the other establishment candidates.
[03:40:35.751 --> 03:40:39.092]  When he became the Republican nominee, they said he could never beat Hillary Clinton.
[03:40:39.092 --> 03:40:40.193]  Well, we saw what happened.
[03:40:40.193 --> 03:40:41.233]  Donald Trump won.
[03:40:41.233 --> 03:40:46.956]  The people in this country, in this state as well, are sick and tired of the career politicians that you said earlier.
[03:40:47.924 --> 03:40:50.565]  They rely on the money train that is taxes.
[03:40:50.565 --> 03:40:56.546]  They go into our pockets every single quarter, every single month, and take our money from us by force.
[03:40:56.546 --> 03:41:06.869]  I was sitting in a budget meeting, the very first budget meeting I was as a state senator, and they had this chart up on the wall that was a graph of what they call revenue.
[03:41:06.869 --> 03:41:08.409]  Again, what it is is taxation.
[03:41:08.409 --> 03:41:11.910]  And they're all patting themselves on the back because they had collected more revenue.
[03:41:12.791 --> 03:41:15.653]  I was sitting there thinking, oh my goodness, these guys don't know what they're talking about.
[03:41:15.653 --> 03:41:16.713]  This is not revenue.
[03:41:16.713 --> 03:41:20.055]  This is taking our money by force.
[03:41:20.055 --> 03:41:21.776]  There is no product they're selling.
[03:41:21.776 --> 03:41:22.817]  They're taking it from us.
[03:41:22.817 --> 03:41:24.578]  And then what they do with it, it's astounding.
[03:41:24.578 --> 03:41:26.539]  Like I said, I'm a CPA.
[03:41:26.539 --> 03:41:29.120]  I actually enjoy reading audit reports and financial statements.
[03:41:29.120 --> 03:41:35.104]  I've been diving into the books here in the state of Georgia, and we waste billions of dollars every single year.
[03:41:36.144 --> 03:41:37.985]  It's mind-numbing, the amount of money that we waste.
[03:41:37.985 --> 03:41:40.586]  And again, the career politicians, they don't care.
[03:41:40.586 --> 03:41:45.028]  As long as they get the support of the lobbyists, the special interests, they'll dole out our money all day long.
[03:41:45.028 --> 03:41:49.110]  We see that with tax credits and all kinds of other programs that we have here in the state of Georgia.
[03:41:49.110 --> 03:41:53.793]  Again, that benefits a select few people, not the people of Georgia.
[03:41:53.793 --> 03:41:59.836]  You know, it's funny you mention it, because your chief opponent, Casey Cagle, reminds me very much of Jeb Bush.
[03:41:59.836 --> 03:42:02.397]  You know, lots of money, but no votes.
[03:42:03.181 --> 03:42:18.177]  Here's a guy who's been in public office for 24 years straight, been on the public payroll since he was 28 years old, never created a job, never made a payroll, but more importantly, not much of a legislative record either.
[03:42:18.177 --> 03:42:21.080]  Classic go-along-to-get-along politician.
[03:42:21.700 --> 03:42:30.211]  Uh, who secretly opposes pay raises for, for cops and firemen for law enforcement, then publicly tries to pretend he was for it.
[03:42:30.211 --> 03:42:34.136]  Uh, it's the typical, you know, politicians two-step.
[03:42:34.136 --> 03:42:35.298]  I've seen this one before.
[03:42:36.033 --> 03:42:37.674]  No, exactly, Roger.
[03:42:37.674 --> 03:42:38.995]  You just hit the nail on the head.
[03:42:38.995 --> 03:42:41.537]  He's been in office for a quarter of a century.
[03:42:41.537 --> 03:42:48.221]  Not only that, Republicans have controlled the state of Georgia for over a decade with the governor's office, the House, and the Senate.
[03:42:48.221 --> 03:42:51.263]  And we still have the highest state income tax in the Southeast.
[03:42:51.263 --> 03:42:53.565]  I think South Carolina has a little bit higher than us.
[03:42:53.565 --> 03:42:59.929]  Our budget has grown from $15 billion to $25 billion in the past seven years.
[03:42:59.929 --> 03:43:04.192]  And again, to your point earlier, I had a bill this past legislative session where we
[03:43:05.413 --> 03:43:07.734]  We're trying to give our law enforcement officers a pay raise.
[03:43:07.734 --> 03:43:13.158]  We have 3,200 law enforcement officers in the state of Georgia that are on food stamps.
[03:43:13.158 --> 03:43:14.899]  That is an embarrassment.
[03:43:14.899 --> 03:43:16.400]  He killed that in the Senate.
[03:43:16.400 --> 03:43:26.586]  Now, there's plenty of money to give to build stadiums and parking lots and all that kind of good stuff for big corporate out there, but where is the money for the law enforcement officers when they need it?
[03:43:26.586 --> 03:43:29.068]  Again, having anybody supporting us
[03:43:29.588 --> 03:43:34.391]  With their lives on the line every single day, and they have to be on food stamps.
[03:43:34.391 --> 03:43:36.552]  Again, it's an embarrassment, and we need to do something about it.
[03:43:36.552 --> 03:43:41.054]  We need to, again, support the people of Georgia, not the career politicians in the establishment.
[03:43:42.306 --> 03:43:45.969]  Now, Senator, here's a political question for you.
[03:43:45.969 --> 03:43:51.613]  Donald Trump's victory in the state of Georgia was by about four points.
[03:43:51.613 --> 03:43:58.797]  It's certainly significant and solid, but I expected perhaps that it might have been a little bigger.
[03:43:58.797 --> 03:44:03.961]  If the election were held again tomorrow in Georgia, what would be the result?
[03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:14.295]  I believe that he would win by a drastic margin right now because the people here in Georgia, they love what our president is doing.
[03:44:14.295 --> 03:44:25.882]  They are seeing a man who is committed to bringing our country back, to making America great again, and he is fighting tooth and nail against the media on both sides, both the right and the left.
[03:44:25.882 --> 03:44:30.005]  I mean, I have a Senate right now that will not pass the repeal of Obama.
[03:44:30.988 --> 03:44:32.629]  I have to paint on doing that.
[03:44:32.629 --> 03:44:40.052]  Again, it continues to add fuel to that fire that we are feeling where we're just tired of these politicians that say one thing and do something else.
[03:44:40.052 --> 03:44:49.396]  So, I don't know what the number would be, but I know he would win by a much larger margin, primarily because, again, I'm talking to people out there that say, you know, they are in support of their president.
[03:44:49.396 --> 03:44:52.077]  And also, he won 159, I'm sorry, 155 of 159 counties here in Georgia primary.
[03:44:52.077 --> 03:44:53.357]  So, he has a strong base here in Georgia.
[03:44:58.991 --> 03:45:03.236]  Well, we're going to be following your race very, very closely.
[03:45:03.236 --> 03:45:12.285]  It was my colleague Owen Shoyer here at InfoWars who first picked up on the Omar Navarro for Congress campaign against Maxine Waters.
[03:45:12.285 --> 03:45:17.411]  We're also going to be following Carla Spaulding, the Republican candidate against Deborah Wasserman Schultz.
[03:45:17.911 --> 03:45:18.872]  In Fort Lauderdale.
[03:45:18.872 --> 03:45:23.133]  We're going to be watching your campaign for Georgia as well.
[03:45:23.133 --> 03:45:35.199]  I know this is an uphill grassroots, you know, hand-to-hand combat endeavor, but I have a feeling that you are on the right course.
[03:45:35.199 --> 03:45:39.521]  And we will welcome you back at InfoWars to give us a kind of an update down the road.
[03:45:40.245 --> 03:45:40.805]  Well, thank you.
[03:45:40.805 --> 03:45:43.866]  And if I may, Roger, can I just direct everybody to our website?
[03:45:43.866 --> 03:45:46.466]  They can go to learn more about our campaign.
[03:45:46.466 --> 03:45:47.927]  It's WilliamsGeorgia.com.
[03:45:47.927 --> 03:45:49.867]  And like you said, we're relying on grassroots.
[03:45:49.867 --> 03:45:56.589]  I've already put a lot of money myself in the campaign, but anybody who wants to support the president here in Georgia, support his movement.
[03:45:56.589 --> 03:45:59.429]  I appreciate any donations y'all can throw our way.
[03:45:59.429 --> 03:46:01.190]  Again, it's WilliamsGeorgia.com.
[03:46:01.190 --> 03:46:01.870]  And thanks for having me on.
[03:46:02.748 --> 03:46:03.068]  Great.
[03:46:03.068 --> 03:46:04.129]  There he is, folks.
[03:46:04.129 --> 03:46:10.275]  Fearless conservative, Michael Williams, the new breed of Republican.
[03:46:10.275 --> 03:46:23.008]  We are back to tell you that this very day, the United States Cannabis Coalition, a bipartisan nonprofit, which is an ad hoc
[03:46:23.735 --> 03:46:25.055]  project of the U.S.
[03:46:25.055 --> 03:46:27.836]  Freedom Coalition was launched.
[03:46:27.836 --> 03:46:47.380]  My co-partner in this endeavor is the trial lawyer from Orlando, John Morgan, who is widely and correctly credited with single-handedly passing the constitutional amendment in Florida that allows for the sale of medicinal marijuana.
[03:46:48.381 --> 03:47:02.897]  We simply call on the President, who courageously said that he would support the access of millions of Americans, including our veterans, to medicinal marijuana in the 29 states where it is legal.
[03:47:02.897 --> 03:47:06.862]  We simply call on the President to keep that pledge.
[03:47:07.734 --> 03:47:26.700]  We're deeply disturbed by grumblings that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the White House Chief of Staff General Kelly are plotting a criminal crackdown in those states where there is a dichotomy between federal and state law.
[03:47:26.700 --> 03:47:30.901]  And of course, the feds argue that marijuana is illegal.
[03:47:32.116 --> 03:47:47.225]  The Holderman memo, in essence a directive from the Attorney General under Barack Obama, that the feds would stand down where the states have legalized, is sound public policy and has worked well.
[03:47:48.200 --> 03:47:59.105]  Millions of Americans have been assisted, and thousands of jobs have been created, while millions more in revenue have been generated.
[03:47:59.105 --> 03:48:05.887]  More importantly, opioid deaths, opioid-related crimes, and all minor crimes are down.
[03:48:05.887 --> 03:48:09.449]  This is a bipartisan effort, folks, Republicans and Democrats.
[03:48:10.269 --> 03:48:25.335]  Liberals and conservatives, progressives and libertarians, working together to persuade the President to keep his pledge regarding states' rights and the state's rights to self-determination on the question of marijuana.
[03:48:25.335 --> 03:48:31.597]  We also support a change from the Schedule 1 rating of marijuana so that doctors,
[03:48:32.197 --> 03:48:55.511]  Can prescribe it for their patients who would benefit that will be in the news And you can go to us cannabis coalition org for more information This is a great time folks to tell you one more time that we here really are challenged by the the tech left
[03:48:55.971 --> 03:49:06.319]  Who would, frankly, use manipulation of the algorithms and all these fake news computer games to limit our reach to you.
[03:49:06.319 --> 03:49:18.709]  That is why we are in a fight over free press and free expression and why I need you to go to the InfoWars store now and take advantage of these 1776 specials.
[03:49:21.131 --> 03:49:26.453]  Yes, you'll be helping us, but you will also be helping yourself.
[03:49:26.453 --> 03:49:29.874]  More importantly, you'll be helping the fight for freedom.
[03:49:29.874 --> 03:49:36.596]  The fight against the upcoming coup, against our president who is duly elected.
[03:49:36.596 --> 03:49:39.837]  No one else will keep you apprised of what's going on.
[03:49:40.477 --> 03:49:41.558]  Again, the 1776 specials.
[03:49:41.558 --> 03:49:43.818]  You will not see prices like this again soon.
[03:50:06.949 --> 03:50:12.681]  I thank you, and we will be back momentarily.
[03:50:12.681 --> 03:50:15.908]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:50:47.842 --> 03:50:49.743]  Extendivite really works.
[03:50:49.743 --> 03:50:51.965]  Just listen to what some people have to say.
[03:50:51.965 --> 03:50:58.108]  Several years ago, I was developing a very severe situation.
[03:50:58.108 --> 03:51:00.650]  I called it my flippy heart.
[03:51:00.650 --> 03:51:03.532]  It was just doing not good things.
[03:51:03.532 --> 03:51:09.976]  And I did not want to go to a medical doctor because I just knew they would give me a cover-up pill.
[03:51:09.976 --> 03:51:13.138]  I didn't want to get on to that sort of thing at all.
[03:51:13.138 --> 03:51:14.959]  When I learned it was garlic,
[03:51:15.639 --> 03:51:19.661]  And cayenne, and cayenne is a healer.
[03:51:19.661 --> 03:51:21.802]  It is a wonderful herb.
[03:51:21.802 --> 03:51:24.283]  I said, I think I'm on to something here.
[03:51:24.283 --> 03:51:26.343]  I'll tell you, I wouldn't be without it.
[03:51:26.343 --> 03:51:29.064]  It did wonderful things for me.
[03:51:29.064 --> 03:51:34.106]  Extendivite is only $69.95 for a two-month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:51:34.106 --> 03:51:34.867]  Call now!
[03:51:34.867 --> 03:51:36.347]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:46.747 --> 03:51:52.109]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:51:52.109 --> 03:51:54.951]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[03:51:54.951 --> 03:51:56.932]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[03:51:56.932 --> 03:52:01.935]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[03:52:01.935 --> 03:52:04.016]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:52:04.016 --> 03:52:05.296]  In fact, it's certified.
[03:52:05.296 --> 03:52:10.199]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:52:10.379 --> 03:52:17.224]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:52:17.224 --> 03:52:23.869]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:52:23.869 --> 03:52:30.754]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:52:30.754 --> 03:52:37.960]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.

[03:53:44.322 --> 03:53:45.043]  Effective.
[03:53:57.830 --> 03:53:59.173]  Yeah!
[03:54:02.828 --> 03:54:03.529]  Thank you very much.
[03:54:03.529 --> 03:54:04.730]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:54:04.730 --> 03:54:06.091]  A little ZZ Top there.
[03:54:06.091 --> 03:54:10.734]  That's a lot of music for just three guys from Texas.
[03:54:10.734 --> 03:54:20.042]  Speaking of Texas, I'm headed to Austin to guest host for Alex Jones on Thursday and Friday of this week.
[03:54:20.042 --> 03:54:29.029]  And we're going to be laying out in greater detail the extraordinary evidence that proves Ukrainian collusion with Hillary Clinton's campaign
[03:54:29.790 --> 03:54:39.700]  And shockingly, the Ukrainian role in now supplying deadly missile technology to North Korea.
[03:54:39.700 --> 03:54:46.848]  We also will be talking about the Deborah Wasserman Schultz.
[03:54:48.246 --> 03:54:53.430]  IT scandal, which grows worse by the day.
[03:54:53.430 --> 03:55:08.623]  You see, it is not just that Deborah Wasserman Schultz badgered the Capitol Hill police chief to get the laptops seized in the investigation into the shady Pakistani Awan brothers.
[03:55:08.623 --> 03:55:13.688]  It's also that Wasserman Schultz, after she was formally notified
[03:55:14.288 --> 03:55:30.060]  of the investigation changed the status of one of the brothers in the system from consultant to employee to guarantee his continued access to the US House of Representatives computer system.
[03:55:30.060 --> 03:55:37.906]  This is, of course, completely in the view of many attorneys, makes her an accessory.
[03:55:39.321 --> 03:55:51.509]  Deborah Wasserman Schultz said last week that perhaps the Awan brothers who stole data and money are only being persecuted because of their Muslim faith.
[03:55:52.833 --> 03:56:22.773]  This is a race to watch because Deborah Washington Schultz will be opposed in the Democratic primary by a Bernie Sanders supporter, Tim Canova, and is likely to be opposed on the Republican side by an exceptional candidate, Carla Spaulding, who is a single mother of three and the holders of a master's degree, a former registered nurse, who was a whistleblower who uncovered corruption at the Veterans Administration.
[03:56:22.773 --> 03:56:26.178]  We have an extraordinarily good amount of
[03:56:38.517 --> 03:56:46.140]  tough political analysis and reporting in the pipeline for the end of the week.
[03:56:46.140 --> 03:56:58.925]  And of course, I will be working with Gary Heaven and David Knight and others to bring you immediate reports and analysis on the situation around the president.
[03:56:58.925 --> 03:57:01.026]  We are in perilous times.
[03:57:01.759 --> 03:57:10.785]  There is, as Anthony Scaramucci told us on ABC, a cadre around the president who seek to take him out.
[03:57:10.785 --> 03:57:15.228]  We will keep you abreast of the entire coup.
[03:57:15.228 --> 03:57:18.210]  Stay tuned here at InfoWars.
[03:57:18.210 --> 03:57:19.491]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:57:19.491 --> 03:57:20.812]  Victory or death.
[03:57:22.668 --> 03:57:33.093]  Also, we are, I see, we are, I think it would be remiss not to talk for just a moment about that ABC interview.
[03:57:33.093 --> 03:57:36.334]  It is key that Scaramucci said three key things.
[03:57:36.334 --> 03:57:42.917]  One, he confirmed that there are those deep in the bowels of the White House whose job it is to, his words, eject the president.
[03:57:43.718 --> 03:57:50.865]  He criticized Steve Bannon, which I have spoken of earlier, but he expressed some support for H.R.
[03:57:50.865 --> 03:57:51.526]  McMaster.
[03:57:51.526 --> 03:57:53.067]  Let me be clear.
[03:57:53.067 --> 03:57:59.314]  My criticism of Steve Bannon does not mean that I am a fan of the globalist crowd around McMaster.
[03:57:59.314 --> 03:58:03.458]  So, Roger Stone, again, joining you at InfoWars.
[03:58:03.458 --> 03:58:05.320]  Many thanks for joining us.
